0	10000	Hello. Hello, you apes. Well, welcome. My name is Mitch Hurwitz. I'm the temporary
10000	16000	cop stroller here in Harman Town. Is that what the guy's name is? Dan Harman, I understand.
16000	21000	Well, I want you to give it up. He's not even backstage yet. So don't give it up, I guess.
21000	27000	Just hang on to it and get ready to say hello to the mayor of Harman Town.
28000	31000	Dan Harman!
34000	40000	Thank you. Thank you, guest cop stroller Mitch Hurwitz. Thank you. Thank you very much.
40000	45000	I'm sorry, I didn't know that you didn't know, but for some reason I always come up through the crowd.
45000	50000	I don't know much about anything. I was listening to Harman Town on the way over to kind of prepare.
51000	55000	Certainly you had the sense that Jeff always sees me in the back room.
55000	58000	First of all, I didn't realize you were recording it.
60000	63000	So people elect to listen to this.
63000	68000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. They drive to work or they, I don't know.
68000	70000	Well, good for them.
70000	74000	It's a whole new world full of less fame and more stuff to listen to.
74000	79000	No, I do know all about it. In fact, I was here, Dan doesn't like people to know this part of it,
79000	83000	but we started our rehearsal early today. We did this at one o'clock.
83000	87000	And I hope I remember everything.
87000	99000	It is the only thing that I ask people that are involved in the show to keep a secret is the amount of preparation that goes into the show.
99000	105000	Because I find it uncharismatic. I like to pretend that we stay in the moment here at the show.
105000	109000	I'm less groomed than the normal comptroller. Did you notice that?
109000	111000	No. Really?
111000	113000	Oh, then Jeff you mean because he's a dapper.
113000	115000	Yeah, he's very dapper.
115000	118000	And actually maybe later we can talk about some grooming ideas for me.
118000	124000	Because I just looked in the mirror on the way out here and I thought, I might be too old for this hairstyle.
124000	126000	What do you mean?
126000	129000	Well, we'll get to do it. Do your thing.
129000	131000	Well, what do you do different?
131000	133000	That's what I want to get your opinion on.
133000	137000	I mean, I guess you could shave it down to like a little short.
137000	139000	That sounds sexy.
139000	143000	You could grow it out into a big old poofy thing.
143000	145000	Those are the only two things I can imagine.
145000	147000	Yeah, I really have the two options.
147000	149000	It could be longer or shorter.
149000	151000	Small ball, large ball.
151000	153000	I'm not the guy to talk to about this.
153000	157000	I will go to the stylist sometimes and just say, small ball me, will you?
158000	164000	Look, let's try not to have the whole show be you and I just blowing each other.
164000	166000	But you're a very handsome man.
166000	169000	I'm going to just really quickly take off my shirt. I want to show you.
169000	170000	Wow.
170000	172000	I'm not.
172000	181000	I was shocked when I met you because I assumed from how talented you were that you must have been 800 pounds.
181000	186000	The first time I ever saw you physically, I went to the set of Arrested Development shooting.
186000	187000	I remember meeting you, yes.
187000	192000	For some reason, I didn't Google image search you to be prepared for anything.
192000	197000	I just pictured this mountain of a man with birds and squirrels and his beard.
197000	201000	I know that's a compliment.
201000	202000	It is.
202000	204000	I don't feel like saying thank you.
204000	211000	I pictured David Milch as being a slightly less large mountain with a couple of less squirrels.
211000	221000	I pictured Vince Gilligan as being like, I don't know, like maybe twice as fat as both of us with like a corkshoot-shaped dick or something.
221000	230000	I automatically assume if people are that talented that they ought to be misshapen.
230000	231000	That's very nice.
231000	232000	Well, I'm getting there.
232000	239000	I do remember when I met you, I think the first thing I said so as not to scare you off was fuck them.
239000	240000	And you were like, yeah, right?
240000	242000	I was like, no, because it was right after.
242000	249000	It was a dream come true because you were like an oily salve on my gaping wounds.
249000	254000	Again, I don't feel like saying thank you.
254000	257000	But I know it's a nice thing that you're...
257000	260000	I also thought you'd be cranky and not approachable.
260000	262000	This is all self-justification.
262000	266000	I think like, okay, I'm a bad person in this way, that way, that way.
266000	276000	So as long as the guy that made the rest of development is fatter and more of an asshole, that puts me on a map that makes sense.
276000	277000	I think I just hide it better.
277000	278000	I really do.
278000	281000	I can be more of an asshole tonight, if you'd like.
281000	282000	Just try it for five minutes.
282000	284000	I'll be like Niles to your Frasier.
284000	286000	Just give it a taste.
286000	289000	Let's just give it a taste so we can turn it off.
289000	292000	So what else is going on in the news today?
292000	295000	I guess our Vice President is up to his old tricks again.
296000	297000	Quail.
298000	300000	I haven't seen a paper in a while.
301000	306000	Health care is at an all-time...
309000	310000	...health.
313000	314000	Well, you know, don't you agree?
314000	316000	It's all bullshit, man.
316000	317000	It's all bullshit.
321000	323000	This is you being an asshole?
324000	325000	This is it.
326000	327000	Let's reset.
330000	331000	Let's see.
331000	333000	I took a bath tonight.
336000	337000	Thank you.
340000	343000	You're a big water displacement guy, right?
343000	344000	I mean, that's...
344000	345000	You're a whole...
345000	346000	Ouch.
346000	347000	Yes.
347000	348000	Like, you don't care about weight.
348000	349000	By Archimedes principles, yes.
349000	350000	Yeah, you care about mass.
350000	353000	I make the water care about it, yeah.
353000	358000	I took a bath, and I love taking bubble baths,
358000	361000	but Aaron bought me, for my birthday,
361000	364000	a waterproof iPad sleeve.
364000	368000	It's just a plastic bag that seals,
368000	372000	but the plastic is made out of a material
372000	374000	that allows for your wet, soapy fingers
374000	377000	to pinch and zoom and tap and double tap...
377000	378000	Nice.
378000	379000	...right through the bag.
380000	381000	And you got...
381000	383000	Just because I missed a couple of shows,
383000	385000	but you got her a diamond ring, didn't you?
385000	386000	Wasn't there a...
387000	390000	As I recall, there was like a big, large...
391000	393000	That was fitted that you actually had to choose.
393000	396000	But it was definitely the waterproof iPad case of engagements.
397000	401000	And she's getting the iPad case of husbands, for sure.
403000	404000	She's a head.
404000	406000	She's a more generous person than me,
406000	409000	no matter how much I would ever give her.
409000	410000	But she...
412000	414000	And it's not like a thing...
414000	415000	You don't submerge it.
415000	417000	It's not like, hey, submerge it.
417000	421000	There's not a picture on the cover of an Asian girl in a pool
421000	423000	with goggles smiling.
423000	427000	Like a picture of a fish on the iPad, under the water.
427000	428000	Right.
428000	432000	And with a burst that says, try submerging it.
432000	435000	It also doesn't say, don't submerge it.
435000	439000	But I assume you shouldn't just like hold it under and tempt fate.
439000	443000	But the big difference is, if this is a thing that you put on your iPad,
443000	448000	if you dropped it, definitely, and you just grab it and fish it out,
448000	449000	it's going to be fine.
449000	452000	And that makes the world of difference.
452000	455000	So like, here's the thing about my life.
456000	459000	Two things like, keep me going.
459000	467000	Hot, soapy baths and tweeting, I guess.
467000	468000	That's not right.
468000	472000	Usually just at people who say like, oh, I was disappointed in last night's episode
472000	475000	and I just go, fuck off, fuck off.
475000	481000	And then I just, I feel, it feels like I took a bath with my, in my heart or something.
481000	483000	And I'm like, so...
483000	484000	You drew a buoyance.
484000	487000	And I never, like, whenever I would get into the bath, I would, it wasn't,
487000	491000	like, most people, they get out when they feel clean or they feel pruney.
491000	494000	I would get out when I, like, I haven't tweeted in a while.
494000	495000	Right.
495000	496000	Yeah, okay, I get it.
496000	499000	So somebody might be saying, hey, good show last night.
499000	501000	Yeah, or I was disappointed.
501000	503000	I better get off my ass and say thank you.
503000	507000	I was disappointed in last night's episode.
507000	508000	Don't say anything.
508000	510000	Just take a bath if you agree.
512000	513000	And then I miss it.
513000	514000	No, you miss it.
514000	515000	Sorry, I already blocked you, bro.
515000	516000	Harmon admits.
516000	517000	Yeah.
517000	518000	Mistakes were made.
518000	519000	Yeah.
519000	520000	Yeah.
520000	528000	So I sunk into this soapy water and I tweeted, I'm taking a bath.
528000	531000	And I took a picture of myself taking a bath.
531000	533000	And then I had nothing else to say.
533000	534000	Yeah.
534000	540000	But I took the longest bath in the world because I had the, it didn't, I never used it again.
540000	541000	I didn't do anything with it.
541000	544000	But it was there in a plastic bag next to the tub.
544000	547000	So I took the world's longest, most satisfying bath.
547000	548000	Great.
548000	554000	You could have watched, you could have watched like Showa on your iPad and just really just dug it.
554000	555000	Just enjoyed it.
555000	556000	Relaxed.
556000	558000	Because you love the Holocaust, right?
558000	559000	Wasn't that you?
560000	562000	Is Showa, is that?
562000	563000	Oh, it's a hoot.
564000	569000	Rob Schrabb, who's coming out later, did a very funny comic book about it.
570000	572000	It's about the Holocaust.
573000	577000	I stopped taking baths when I realized, which was late in life.
577000	581000	I mean, it was in my late 20s when I realized that the penis floats.
583000	591000	And it floats, for those of you, I guess, who are women or under 29.
592000	597000	And I didn't like, I didn't like seeing it in there in the bubbles.
598000	599000	You know what I mean?
600000	601000	It embarrassed me.
601000	603000	I'm sorry to say that I do not have that problem.
604000	605000	My balls float.
606000	607000	The penis doesn't float.
607000	611000	My penis, as I've said on this podcast, is a, it's very, I'm proud of it.
612000	614000	I've heard great things.
615000	619000	If there was no such thing as this whole mythology of like size and stuff.
620000	621000	Yeah, that's bullshit.
621000	623000	Apparatus wise, it's very functional.
623000	627000	I would look at it as Darwin, I would go like, this is a very fit specimen.
628000	633000	Because that thing, when it's not needed, it's like, boom, it's gone.
634000	638000	And that, I think, in the world of saber-toothed tigers is like, that's valuable.
639000	641000	I would look at that as like, I'm impressed by that.
642000	643000	This guy's like Inspector Gadget.
644000	648000	I'll tell you what's not impressive are the balls.
649000	653000	No, mine are giant and they're unwieldy and they're, but go on, please tell.
654000	655000	I think they're all unwieldy.
655000	657000	I mean, that's the nature of the ball.
659000	661000	But you know why they're on the outside of the body.
662000	663000	I'm sure you do.
663000	667000	One degree, apparently spermatogenesis requires one degree difference.
667000	669000	I've never understood this about God.
669000	672000	No, it's the argument against intelligent design, really, isn't it?
672000	673000	It really totally is.
673000	675000	Because it's like, if there was a God.
675000	677000	You would go like, oh, the eyeball's so complicated.
677000	680000	Yeah, let's talk about your nuts, you fucking idiot.
680000	684000	And the solution, the design solution, which if Apple came up with it,
684000	686000	you would blog how much you hate the thing is.
686000	687000	How about a sack?
687000	688000	Yeah.
688000	691000	How about a sack on the outside, maybe in one of the hands?
691000	694000	Gentlemen, what if part of the inside of the body was outside the body?
694000	696000	It's sort of dangle in open air.
696000	697000	Well, you know what?
697000	698000	It's never going to be a problem.
698000	699000	People walk on all fours.
699000	701000	It's never going to be a problem.
702000	703000	It's protected.
704000	707000	Yes, because they always explain that in health class.
707000	713000	They go like, well, you need one degree cooler than body temperature to make sperm.
713000	716000	You can't figure out a solution to this inside my body.
716000	718000	Here's your new Jaguar, as you can see.
718000	719000	It's a convertible.
719000	721000	It's got that nice little grill.
721000	724000	And then this is sort of a floppy sack full of gasoline.
724000	727000	Make sure not to hit anything against that.
727000	730000	The answer is that absolutely you could figure out a solution.
730000	735000	You could figure out a solution if you were Steve Jobs, and God is not Steve Jobs.
735000	737000	I'm not saying he's not as smart.
737000	742000	I'm saying he gives way less of a shit about design, about customer satisfaction.
744000	747000	We got mad at Steve Jobs, and he said, then don't hold it that way,
747000	750000	whenever the antenna was on the outside for the first time.
750000	751000	God doesn't answer your emails.
751000	752000	How's that for a start?
752000	756000	Yeah, when you get a human body, it's not always set to Cupertino time.
756000	757000	You know what I mean?
757000	759000	Like, it's not that kind of...
762000	763000	It's a horrible...
763000	766000	I mean, even under the armpit would be...
766000	767000	Would make more sense.
767000	768000	Yeah.
768000	769000	You know, you kind of keep your arm down.
769000	771000	Or just, there's got to be a chemical way.
771000	774000	We've learned, even as humans, with our short time with intelligence,
774000	778000	we've learned how to design things that chemically can create,
778000	781000	could be one degree lower or higher in temperature.
781000	782000	We've done great.
782000	783000	I have toe warmers in my boots.
783000	785000	Not right now, but...
785000	786000	Well, maybe it's...
786000	787000	Maybe that's it.
787000	789000	Maybe they're just waiting for us to discover we need a testicle cooler.
789000	792000	Because they do retract, again, if you're under a certain age,
792000	794000	or you're a woman.
794000	796000	Well, I mean, here's the...
796000	798000	They're always moving.
798000	799000	They get around.
799000	800000	They get around.
800000	803000	If you ever just lay...
803000	805000	If you ever have a healthy relationship enough
805000	808000	where you're just laying on your bed naked,
808000	810000	and in your full Shamu glory,
810000	814000	and just air drying after a shower or something,
814000	817000	and you bother to look down at your balls,
817000	818000	the first thing you'd think would be like,
818000	820000	I'm never going to get a woman.
820000	821000	Yeah.
821000	825000	And if I did, she would be so disgusting.
825000	831000	But the surface of your scrotum continually shifts and moves
831000	834000	like a river of magma,
834000	837000	like some kind of weird psychedelic...
837000	838000	It's self-conscious.
838000	840000	It's incredibly self-conscious.
840000	841000	It's hanging out there.
841000	843000	Yeah, there's nerve endings in your balls,
843000	845000	to be sure, but there's nothing to...
845000	846000	It's only visual.
846000	848000	When you look down at it, you have to see it.
848000	850000	You have to catch it in the act.
850000	855000	Shifting and pulsing and adjusting to what?
855000	857000	To nothing that has to do with me.
857000	860000	Doesn't care if community was good last night.
860000	862000	It has no reaction to anything.
862000	863000	Just staying ready.
863000	864000	Just moving around.
864000	865000	Staying ready.
865000	869000	I guess based on making that one temperature...
869000	871000	Yeah, and kind of getting ready for sex
871000	872000	and kind of thinking like,
872000	874000	hey, let's not let these guys get too productive.
874000	875000	Right.
875000	877000	Let's distract them.
877000	880000	I have to imagine that pants,
880000	882000	they raise the temperature of your balls
882000	884000	by at least a degree.
884000	886000	That's interesting.
886000	888000	Thank you for pretending that's the case.
888000	892000	The problem is these universities,
892000	895000	they just don't give up the research money for all of them.
895000	897000	You've got to sound so smart.
897000	900000	I remember reading that our sperm count had dropped
900000	903000	since the days of World War II, our sperm count had dropped.
903000	905000	Well, you know what has dropped is our testosterone.
905000	906000	Oh, really?
906000	908000	I think it's just because we're nervous.
908000	910000	No, it has.
910000	912000	I talked to a doctor recently,
912000	914000	he did a whole blood panel,
914000	916000	and he said, you know, in my generation,
916000	917000	it would have been like 1200,
917000	919000	and if it dipped below 1200,
919000	922000	I would really feel like weeping all the time.
922000	925000	Your generation, he said, you want to be around 800.
925000	927000	And he said, young people today, it's like 400.
927000	929000	Wait, what?
929000	931000	That's what this nut told me.
931000	932000	I can't say his name.
932000	934000	He was kind of an interesting dude.
934000	936000	But apparently there is a worldwide trend,
936000	939000	and we know this is happening in Asia, right?
939000	941000	They're having a lot less sex.
941000	942000	Uh-huh.
942000	943000	Yeah.
943000	944000	Really?
944000	945000	Yeah, this could be it.
945000	948000	Society could end at nerd melt.
948000	950000	That's as great as we ever got.
950000	952000	You know, we had aqueducts,
952000	954000	and then we had the computer,
954000	956000	and then we did these podcasts, and that was it.
956000	957000	I hadn't heard that,
957000	959000	but I remember becoming terrified in biology class,
959000	961000	a biology teacher explained.
961000	964000	He said, you know, populations of mammals
964000	966000	as they outgrow their food supply,
966000	969000	they radically change in behavior.
969000	973000	If you have a relatively closed-off warehouse full of rats
973000	976000	and a certain amount of food in that warehouse,
976000	980000	the rats will hit a point where they're conscious as a species
980000	982000	or that localized population
982000	984000	of the amount of food that's left,
984000	990000	and they will spontaneously engage in self-mutilation
990000	994000	and murder and all kinds of just, well,
994000	998000	very familiar-sounding behaviors to us and not to rats.
998000	1000000	And I just remember hearing that,
1000000	1003000	and he didn't even bother to say it, so think about it.
1003000	1006000	I don't think he was just pointing that out about mammals,
1006000	1008000	and I was like, holy shit, that's what we're doing.
1008000	1009000	I mean...
1009000	1011000	This is the guy you strangled, right?
1011000	1014000	Because you had to stay there during the snow or something.
1014000	1017000	No, it's a problem.
1017000	1019000	You know, we had 6 billion, what, 20 years ago,
1019000	1021000	and now we got 9 billion.
1021000	1023000	I don't want to bum you guys out.
1023000	1024000	But also...
1024000	1025000	You can't bum these guys out.
1025000	1027000	Like yeast.
1027000	1030000	You know, when yeast is deprived of oxygen,
1030000	1031000	which it really needs, right,
1031000	1034000	if you put it at the bottom of a bunch of grape juice,
1034000	1035000	it makes alcohol.
1035000	1037000	So maybe that's our destiny.
1037000	1040000	Yeah, that's why we have alcohol.
1040000	1043000	Because they want oxygen,
1043000	1046000	but there's nothing there but fruit juice,
1046000	1048000	and it happens in our body, too.
1048000	1050000	So that's how you create alcohol.
1050000	1051000	Let's try it.
1051000	1054000	It's like the opposite of making lemons out of lemon,
1054000	1055000	or lemonade out of lemons.
1055000	1057000	It's like making poison out of...
1057000	1059000	Out of lemonade.
1059000	1060000	Right, exactly.
1060000	1063000	Not enough lemonade, I don't know.
1063000	1064000	Like, you're saying that...
1064000	1066000	Well, yeast isn't getting drunk, though.
1066000	1069000	No, yeast is basically shitting alcohol.
1069000	1070000	Yeah.
1070000	1071000	Yeah.
1071000	1072000	Which I know that you have...
1072000	1073000	Well, I don't know how much you want to reveal.
1073000	1074000	No, tell them anything.
1074000	1075000	Go ahead.
1075000	1077000	So, we went out the other night.
1077000	1079000	And we said, what can you shit?
1079000	1080000	Yeah.
1080000	1083000	Mitch shit the entire Bill of Rights.
1083000	1084000	Now, here's what's...
1084000	1087000	I swear to God, I found one typo.
1087000	1090000	There was one typo.
1090000	1092000	Not true.
1092000	1093000	Not true.
1093000	1096000	Self-urvedent.
1096000	1100000	And I didn't bother to point it out.
1100000	1103000	Those were, you know, my S's and my F's
1103000	1105000	when I shit Bill of Rights.
1105000	1108000	I do it the way they did it.
1108000	1110000	The Preffident shall have.
1110000	1113000	All right, well, we have some friends here tonight.
1113000	1114000	I guess we should bring them out,
1114000	1119000	since we've covered all the fundamental material.
1119000	1120000	Yeah.
1120000	1122000	Our first friend that's out here,
1122000	1124000	he's celebrating a special event.
1125000	1128000	He's my best friend from Milwaukee before I moved to L.A.
1128000	1130000	The reason I moved to L.A. is because
1130000	1133000	this guy I was doing stand-up and improv with
1133000	1135000	created this comic book on his kitchen table
1135000	1138000	that got the film rights optioned by Oliver Stone.
1138000	1141000	And so, we moved out to L.A.
1141000	1142000	because we thought that that meant
1142000	1145000	it's time to participate in Hollywood.
1145000	1148000	We were so wrong and so naive, but thank God we were.
1148000	1153000	And he's the beginning of the second chapter of my life.
1154000	1157000	He is my everything.
1157000	1161000	He's experienced all the grief and disillusionment
1161000	1164000	and triumphs and victories from the age of 20
1164000	1167000	to the age of 35 with me.
1167000	1169000	And it just so happens that comic book
1169000	1171000	that he created on his kitchen table,
1171000	1174000	it turns 20 years old on Wednesday,
1174000	1177000	which should make me feel sad.
1177000	1180000	But I don't know.
1180000	1182000	I think you get to a certain age
1182000	1185000	where that kind of stuff makes you feel good.
1185000	1187000	Yeah, I think that's absolutely true.
1187000	1188000	That's good to me.
1188000	1192000	That's the fantasy of pharaohs and kings
1192000	1194000	and fat people with rec rooms,
1194000	1197000	is to make something that lasts 20 years.
1197000	1199000	So, let's bring out somebody who's made something
1199000	1202000	that's last 20 years, my friend Rob Schwab.
1202000	1212000	Applause
1212000	1216000	Rob is wearing his Scud the Disposable Assassin baseball cap,
1216000	1221000	Scud t-shirt, his Fireman press, Fireman jacket.
1221000	1224000	Uh, yeah, yeah.
1224000	1226000	You're all decked out.
1226000	1228000	Now, you're a man of means.
1228000	1229000	You've got your own career.
1229000	1231000	You've moved beyond this comic book you created.
1231000	1232000	Yes.
1232000	1234000	You're not here scratching for dough.
1234000	1235000	No, no.
1235000	1237000	Wait, I'm sorry, you get paid for this?
1237000	1238000	I don't think he does.
1238000	1239000	Okay, don't wait.
1239000	1241000	Because you said he's not here getting, uh,
1241000	1242000	scratching for dough.
1242000	1244000	No, I'm saying he's got, he's got plenty of ways
1244000	1248000	to be happy if all he cares about is material things.
1248000	1250000	But you have an emotional attachment to this product
1250000	1252000	you created when we were kids.
1252000	1253000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1253000	1255000	I created it when I was 23,
1255000	1263000	and it came out 1994, same year as Pulp Fiction.
1263000	1266000	And when the World Trade Center is going down...
1266000	1267000	And what?
1267000	1268000	No, nothing.
1268000	1269000	I...
1269000	1270000	I mis-landed a joke that...
1270000	1272000	Why were you talking over each other so much?
1272000	1273000	Yeah.
1273000	1277000	I want to take this off because it makes my ears look weird.
1277000	1278000	All right.
1278000	1280000	Guys, your ears look amazing now, by the way.
1280000	1281000	Thank you.
1281000	1282000	Yeah.
1282000	1283000	And it could be just me.
1283000	1284000	Thank you very much, Mitch.
1284000	1287000	Have you mentioned what the name of the book is yet?
1287000	1288000	No, I don't think I have, actually.
1288000	1290000	It's Scud the Disposable Assassin.
1290000	1291000	Scud.
1291000	1292000	Scud.
1292000	1293000	Where is it?
1293000	1294000	I saw it back in the crowd.
1294000	1295000	Katie.
1295000	1301000	I laid out some vintage scuds on some of your chairs.
1301000	1302000	Oh.
1302000	1305000	This is a couple of scud number fours.
1305000	1308000	This was the first time you and I really...
1308000	1310000	Well, we wrote sketches and stuff together,
1310000	1312000	but this was the first time we wrote, like, a story.
1312000	1313000	Right.
1313000	1314000	We wrote some comedy sketches together.
1314000	1316000	You trusted me enough that you said, like,
1316000	1319000	hey, write this next issue of my comic book and stuff.
1319000	1320000	Correct.
1320000	1321000	Yeah.
1321000	1324000	You were the first person to learn that I'm a bad...
1324000	1327000	I have a very bad work ethic.
1327000	1330000	I remember a lot of answering machine messages from you going,
1330000	1333000	come on, man.
1333000	1338000	Just tell me how far you are.
1338000	1340000	All water under a bridge, right?
1340000	1342000	Twenty years ago, we had answering machines for the young people.
1342000	1345000	You're probably picturing robots that answered the phone,
1345000	1347000	but no, it was just like a tape recorder.
1347000	1351000	I mean, we had, yeah, you think, oh, how lame answering machines,
1351000	1354000	but holy shit, like, we had these cassette tapes,
1354000	1359000	and, like, every time I called Rob, I would do a character.
1359000	1360000	Yeah.
1360000	1362000	Back in the early days of our improv training,
1362000	1364000	everything was a bit...
1364000	1365000	Everything had to be funny.
1365000	1366000	Everything had to be a bit.
1366000	1369000	We were so into comedy.
1369000	1371000	It's me, Mr. Phillips.
1371000	1372000	Look up for me.
1372000	1375000	Rob, Rob, I'm going to just refrigerate it here for you.
1375000	1377000	And then seriously, pick me up.
1377000	1378000	I'm at the hospital.
1378000	1381000	Yeah.
1381000	1383000	And so for one of my birthdays,
1383000	1387000	Rob gave me a cassette tape, unlabeled,
1387000	1393000	that was a year of all of my shitty comedy messages to him,
1393000	1394000	which you can't do these days.
1394000	1395000	It's a little blue.
1395000	1396000	A little blue.
1396000	1398000	There's some blue material in there.
1398000	1402000	The funny thing is that our technology now allows for so much more,
1402000	1403000	but it's not as...
1403000	1404000	I don't know.
1404000	1405000	It was analog, so it was actually...
1405000	1407000	It was more logical to do it.
1407000	1410000	It was, like, one of those two-hour tapes, you know,
1410000	1414000	and, you know, kids and...
1414000	1415000	What are you...
1415000	1417000	Scotch?
1417000	1420000	But each message was, you know, probably,
1420000	1424000	hey, man, give me a call back.
1424000	1425000	Listen, I'm over here.
1425000	1428000	I got one foot, so I could use two.
1428000	1431000	You know, just dumb fucking garbage.
1431000	1433000	And also a lot of racist shit.
1433000	1434000	A lot of racist shit.
1434000	1436000	Because it was 93.
1436000	1439000	Well, because we knew at that time that African-Americans
1439000	1443000	would never get answering machines, so it was safe, you know?
1443000	1445000	There was some Asian stuff in there, too.
1445000	1447000	You could express your fears.
1447000	1451000	But there was a lot of raps.
1451000	1453000	There was a lot of raps.
1453000	1455000	There was a lot of music in there.
1455000	1457000	But it was, like, it took forever.
1457000	1459000	And I knew, like, your birthday was coming up,
1459000	1462000	and I had, like, another, like, five minutes to go.
1462000	1464000	So I would just, like...
1464000	1467000	I got to, like, call you up with the answering machine
1467000	1469000	or whatever, like, on or whatever.
1469000	1471000	And there was, like, the last couple of months, they're like,
1471000	1473000	what the fuck are you doing?
1473000	1475000	What are you doing?
1475000	1476000	I'm...
1476000	1477000	Fuck.
1477000	1478000	This is so fucking stupid.
1478000	1480000	Why are you doing this?
1480000	1482000	Fuck you.
1483000	1485000	Seriously? Again?
1485000	1486000	Fuck off.
1486000	1487000	You had to fill the tape.
1487000	1489000	Fill the tape.
1489000	1490000	Oh, gosh.
1490000	1491000	And let's...
1491000	1492000	Do you want to...
1492000	1493000	I brought it here tonight.
1493000	1494000	I wish.
1494000	1495000	Bring it out.
1495000	1496000	No, no, no.
1496000	1497000	That's not the tape.
1497000	1498000	That's actually a book.
1498000	1499000	You brought the tape?
1499000	1500000	No, I wish.
1500000	1502000	The tape doesn't exist.
1502000	1504000	That would have been cool.
1504000	1507000	But you listened to it probably...
1507000	1511000	Well, I probably listened to it 15 times, which is...
1511000	1513000	Unfortunately, I was in a relationship at the time,
1513000	1517000	and my girlfriend, not a fan of the tape.
1517000	1518000	And I don't...
1518000	1522000	If you're dating somebody who secretly hates you,
1522000	1526000	you sit in there going, listen to how funny I am,
1526000	1528000	something's gonna start boiling.
1528000	1529000	Yeah.
1529000	1530000	Something's gonna stew.
1530000	1533000	It's so funny to be looking back how she must have...
1533000	1534000	You want to hear what happened?
1534000	1537000	Who wants to hear what happened to this?
1538000	1543000	Picture making something for your best friend that took a year.
1543000	1546000	Something really personal, something that was actually
1546000	1548000	incredibly entertaining, something that...
1548000	1551000	So, like, bigger than, like, an iPad waterproof case.
1551000	1552000	There you go.
1552000	1554000	So, like, a real...
1554000	1556000	Something worth, like, a diamond ring.
1556000	1557000	Right, you got it.
1557000	1558000	Yeah.
1558000	1559000	A big deal. A big deal.
1559000	1561000	Throw out any carrot you wish, you know?
1561000	1562000	I mean, it was like that.
1562000	1564000	It was something really...
1564000	1566000	Something that would be like...
1566000	1568000	You would frame that, you know?
1568000	1569000	Like now.
1569000	1572000	And then people would go, well, did you want to listen to it?
1572000	1575000	Well, okay, I have to buy, like, a thing on eBay to play it.
1575000	1576000	You know, it's like...
1576000	1578000	But here's this thing.
1578000	1582000	You had it maybe a week, and then one day...
1582000	1584000	Because I would, before I gave it to you,
1584000	1586000	I would listen to it.
1586000	1587000	So I went to my...
1587000	1588000	I thought it was that funny.
1588000	1590000	I went to my girlfriend's place,
1590000	1593000	and I wanted to listen to it for a sixteenth time.
1594000	1596000	Why don't we stay in?
1596000	1597000	Where is it?
1597000	1599000	And listen to my drunk friend, Rob,
1599000	1601000	leave a message on my old machine.
1601000	1602000	Yeah.
1602000	1603000	Should we do it again?
1603000	1605000	I just want to lay in bed with you and listen.
1605000	1608000	Exactly. I mean, my heart goes out to this poor woman.
1608000	1609000	We can put on the good speakers.
1609000	1610000	We'll use the good speakers.
1610000	1611000	But I...
1611000	1616000	Yeah, but any regular, normal, non-psychopath person
1616000	1617000	would go...
1617000	1619000	Would roll their eyes and go, ugh, God.
1619000	1620000	You know, whatever.
1620000	1622000	It's not as entertaining to me as it is to you.
1623000	1625000	Boy, you've got to get over yourself.
1625000	1627000	You would at least give it like a couple of months,
1627000	1628000	maybe a year.
1628000	1630000	You wouldn't go...
1630000	1632000	You wouldn't go, well, that's pretty impressive
1632000	1635000	that your friend did put that much work into it.
1635000	1638000	But this is what happened. Go.
1638000	1640000	I couldn't find it.
1640000	1643000	I wanted to listen to it again.
1643000	1645000	And I said, it's a very sweet story.
1645000	1647000	Where is it?
1647000	1651000	And she said, well, you left it on the windowsill.
1652000	1654000	And it rained.
1654000	1657000	And the rain damaged it so much that
1657000	1659000	I thought it was best to just throw it away.
1659000	1661000	Right. Right.
1661000	1662000	Wow.
1662000	1663000	Spend a year.
1663000	1667000	Because you know when you have like a tape
1667000	1671000	that gets wet, it just disintegrates.
1671000	1676000	We've all had those tapes that disintegrate when water...
1676000	1678000	I mean, let it dry out.
1678000	1680000	We've all been in those house cleaning jags
1680000	1682000	where you just can't...
1682000	1684000	Where else would I put this besides the garbage?
1684000	1686000	Oh, you have to get a towel.
1686000	1691000	Why would I hold onto this as proof of what I'm saying?
1691000	1693000	Did you grill her?
1693000	1695000	So the whole tape was bad?
1695000	1697000	Or just like part of it that got wet?
1697000	1699000	Did you listen to the whole thing?
1699000	1702000	I think I smelled a rat and I said,
1702000	1709000	so you thought it would be best to throw it in the garbage
1709000	1711000	so that I never had to see it wet.
1711000	1713000	Throw it in the garbage
1713000	1716000	and then take it out of the apartment
1716000	1718000	as quickly as possible
1718000	1721000	and throw it into the garbage truck as it's driving away.
1721000	1723000	And it's not the best technology.
1723000	1725000	It really is like, give it a couple days.
1725000	1728000	This thing will get all warbled up and tangled
1728000	1730000	and those things fell apart.
1730000	1733000	I think in that moment I realized I was like,
1733000	1736000	oh shit, she's been listening to that thing a lot
1736000	1738000	and she's been silently...
1738000	1740000	Don't make her a hero.
1740000	1741000	Don't make her a hero.
1741000	1743000	It took me a fucking year to make that thing.
1743000	1744000	Hey...
1744000	1746000	You were getting mad at me at the end?
1746000	1748000	I have the perfect punishment for her.
1748000	1751000	She is currently Dan Harmon's ex-girlfriend.
1751000	1754000	I can't think of a worse fate.
1754000	1758000	And head of the International Monetary Fund.
1758000	1759000	That's a big deal.
1759000	1761000	Yeah, but honestly...
1761000	1762000	I know Dan Harmon's ex.
1762000	1764000	And then she invented the CD.
1764000	1769000	That was really the thing.
1769000	1773000	Because she actually felt so bad about it.
1773000	1774000	Oh my God.
1774000	1775000	Oh my God.
1775000	1780000	If there was only some kind of device that could handle a rainstorm.
1780000	1781000	Right.
1781000	1783000	I got it.
1783000	1785000	She's just working so hard on it
1785000	1788000	and her new mentor love interest played by Pierce Brosnan
1788000	1790000	is like, hey, take it easy.
1790000	1793000	And she's like, I'm sorry, I just...
1794000	1797000	I loved a man once and I...
1797000	1801000	His tape got rained on.
1801000	1804000	I understand.
1804000	1806000	That was a little...
1806000	1809000	My girlfriend was killed by a volcano.
1809000	1812000	Did you see that fucking movie?
1812000	1814000	His girlfriend, really?
1814000	1817000	She got murdered by a volcano.
1817000	1818000	JFK style.
1818000	1820000	He got into a car with her.
1820000	1821000	What movie was this?
1822000	1823000	Dante's Peak.
1823000	1825000	He gets into a car with her.
1825000	1827000	It's like, come on, coss, start.
1827000	1830000	And looks over at her and goes, we're going to be okay.
1830000	1832000	That volcano can't get us now.
1832000	1836000	And she's like, yeah, I love you, Pierce Brosnan.
1836000	1839000	A volcano rock flies through the...
1839000	1842000	Because the volcano, it's personal.
1842000	1846000	And it dissolves to Pierce Brosnan doing crunches
1846000	1848000	on the floor of his apartment.
1848000	1852000	Where he's been living in fucking hatred of volcanoes
1852000	1856000	for sexual reasons for the last 20 years.
1856000	1858000	And the only thing that's going to break him out of it
1858000	1861000	is Linda Hamilton as a civil servant.
1861000	1864000	Because she loves fucking running a city so much
1864000	1867000	and it reminds me of how much she loved volcanoes.
1867000	1869000	He actually says at one point,
1869000	1871000	he says to Linda Hamilton, he goes,
1871000	1873000	I loved a woman once.
1873000	1875000	She loved volcanoes.
1875000	1878000	He says she loved volcanoes.
1878000	1880000	Didn't they say that in Twister too?
1880000	1882000	I'm sure they did, yes.
1882000	1884000	My parents loved Twister so much.
1884000	1886000	Well, in Twister they have to, they create a,
1886000	1888000	they go, it's a category of tornado
1888000	1890000	so that you can identify that.
1890000	1892000	That's the F5.
1892000	1895000	That's the tornado that killed my father.
1895000	1899000	That's the combination of heat and cold.
1899000	1901000	It was twisty just like that.
1901000	1904000	And there was stuff in it.
1904000	1907000	That's the finger of God?
1907000	1910000	I would know it if it wasn't the one that got my dad.
1910000	1912000	It would still be twisty.
1912000	1914000	The layman would make that mistake.
1914000	1915000	That's what these hicks do.
1915000	1917000	They sit on their porch with a shotgun
1917000	1919000	and they go, get off my land, Twister.
1919000	1921000	You killed my pappy.
1921000	1922000	I'm a scientist.
1922000	1925000	I know the one that got my dad.
1925000	1928000	It had a little spin on the top.
1930000	1933000	It had a pointed nose.
1933000	1935000	Sharknado.
1935000	1936000	Sharknado.
1936000	1937000	I don't like this new generation
1937000	1939000	of purposefully ironic horror things.
1939000	1941000	I shark the pussy.
1941000	1943000	No good.
1943000	1945000	Kiss doesn't get the joke.
1945000	1948000	Kiss doesn't get the joke.
1948000	1951000	Dan pointed at me so I repeated it.
1951000	1954000	When Shaw and I first moved to LA
1954000	1955000	we had a meeting.
1955000	1957000	I swear it was Stuart Kornfeld that told us that story, right?
1957000	1959000	Yeah, that was Jack Black that told us the story.
1959000	1960000	Oh, really?
1960000	1961000	Yeah.
1962000	1964000	Because we were talking about Heat Vision and Jack
1964000	1965000	and how it needs to be played serious,
1965000	1967000	otherwise it's not funny.
1967000	1970000	Jack Black told us the story going like,
1970000	1971000	oh, I know what you mean
1971000	1974000	because he told us this parable, this anecdote
1974000	1977000	about some graphic designer that was hired
1977000	1979000	to design a poster for a Kiss reunion.
1979000	1982000	And they made some poster that was sort of like,
1982000	1985000	I don't know, I can't picture this in my head.
1985000	1987000	He's got Gene Simmons but he's like winking
1987000	1989000	and big elbow.
1990000	1991000	You know what I'm talking about?
1991000	1992000	I'm trying to picture the difference
1992000	1994000	between a sincere Kiss poster and an ironic one
1994000	1997000	and I can't picture it, but the important part of the story
1997000	2001000	is that Gene Simmons did and looked at the poster
2001000	2003000	and handed it back to the person and said,
2003000	2006000	look, babe, Kiss doesn't get the joke.
2008000	2012000	You've got me wearing the star on my eye.
2012000	2015000	I don't get it, man.
2016000	2017000	Kiss doesn't get the joke.
2017000	2019000	Kiss has to think that they're demons
2019000	2021000	that have powers and stuff.
2021000	2023000	I did, I thought they were scary.
2023000	2025000	Hey, man, Kiss isn't in on the joke
2025000	2027000	and that's what that ended up being the logline
2027000	2028000	of that concert.
2028000	2029000	That's what...
2029000	2031000	Kiss isn't in on the joke
2031000	2032000	and they really are holding...
2032000	2035000	And that's what Kiss stands for.
2036000	2038000	Kiss isn't so smart.
2038000	2042000	I want to rock and roll all night
2042000	2046000	but I never want to be involved in the joke about it.
2047000	2049000	I know I'm going off meter
2049000	2052000	but it's important that caveat
2052000	2055000	and party every day.
2056000	2058000	Rock and roll all night.
2058000	2060000	What are you guys laughing at? What's so funny?
2060000	2061000	What was it? Some of the laughs.
2061000	2062000	Hey, so what?
2062000	2063000	Who's laughing over here?
2063000	2064000	Who laughed?
2064000	2065000	Get this man out of here.
2065000	2067000	I got two guys laughing in the back.
2067000	2069000	I don't know if that beach ball's a bit...
2069000	2071000	Anyway, party all day.
2071000	2073000	Okay, they're having fun, all right.
2073000	2075000	You're having fun with the beach ball, it's cool.
2075000	2077000	It's about my weight.
2077000	2079000	It's the way of life.
2079000	2080000	It's the way of life.
2080000	2081000	You're an army.
2081000	2083000	You're the Kiss army.
2083000	2084000	Armies don't have beach balls.
2084000	2087000	Let's go invade Ario Speedwagon.
2088000	2090000	Ario Speedwagon gets the joke.
2090000	2092000	That was their big claim to fame.
2092000	2094000	Ario Speedwagon gets the joke.
2094000	2096000	That's what Ario stands for.
2096000	2099000	Yeah, we get the joke in Latin.
2099000	2102000	But toward the end, when they were like 45,
2102000	2104000	they'd come out in a big Speedwagon.
2104000	2105000	It was a big fucking joke.
2105000	2107000	It was so stupid.
2107000	2109000	They'd have pacifiers in their butts,
2109000	2110000	and they were like,
2110000	2112000	where are you, Speedwagon?
2112000	2115000	Ario Stationwagon, I think they started calling themselves.
2115000	2117000	They'd come out in a grand safari.
2117000	2120000	Yeah, the Speedwagon had a baby on board.
2120000	2123000	Really a missed opportunity.
2123000	2127000	All right, so it seems like the Stravwells run dry.
2127000	2131000	No, we have not talked about the big thing.
2131000	2132000	Tell us about Scud.
2133000	2135000	Because there's a lovely story by your wife,
2135000	2138000	who I just asked, are you still married?
2138000	2142000	But in fairness, that was just based on what you were wearing.
2142000	2143000	I just couldn't imagine.
2143000	2145000	I swear to God, we've known Shrav for all nine years.
2145000	2147000	He's dated Kate, and now he's just recently married her.
2147000	2150000	We're all astounded every day that she doesn't dump him.
2150000	2151000	Me too.
2151000	2152000	Right?
2152000	2153000	Me too.
2153000	2154000	She's a fucking trooper.
2154000	2155000	She's amazing.
2155000	2156000	It's crazy.
2156000	2158000	She's Amish, right?
2158000	2160000	I think that might be what it is.
2161000	2163000	Because of his technology, she thinks he's bionic.
2163000	2165000	She doesn't know, yeah.
2165000	2166000	He's so gifted.
2166000	2167000	She's on an extended romspring.
2167000	2169000	Because she wrote a beautiful foreword.
2169000	2170000	She really did.
2170000	2171000	You guys are real funny.
2171000	2172000	You guys are real funny.
2172000	2173000	Real funny.
2173000	2176000	This is my life.
2176000	2178000	He just lights cigarettes in front of her,
2178000	2181000	and she's like, wow, he's amazing.
2181000	2185000	I mean, he's not that bright, and he's verbally abusive,
2185000	2188000	but he can make fire with his hand.
2189000	2192000	And for that reason, I will stay with him.
2192000	2195000	He has a box with moving images on it in his living room.
2195000	2196000	All right, all right, all right.
2196000	2197000	The floor is like grass.
2197000	2198000	All right.
2198000	2201000	He started out so good about this present
2201000	2203000	that I took a year to make,
2203000	2206000	and now you're fucking with me.
2206000	2209000	I'll read from the foreword.
2209000	2211000	Oh, okay, okay.
2211000	2214000	When I first saw Rob Schrab make fire...
2214000	2215000	Okay.
2219000	2222000	I knew that even though he could not make a hinge,
2222000	2225000	he had special powers.
2228000	2229000	So romantic.
2229000	2233000	It's like those Twilight stories, I guess.
2233000	2234000	I assume.
2234000	2236000	Did you do this to Kumail when he comes out here?
2236000	2237000	No, I don't.
2237000	2239000	Let's bring out Kumail.
2240000	2243000	Man of the hour.
2245000	2246000	Hello.
2246000	2247000	I'm not the man of the hour.
2247000	2248000	Rob's the man of the hour.
2248000	2249000	What are you talking about?
2249000	2253000	You're celebrating your 20th anniversary
2253000	2257000	being 20 years older than you were 20 years ago.
2257000	2259000	I heard about that.
2259000	2260000	You know what?
2260000	2261000	Good job.
2261000	2263000	In a way, I am.
2263000	2265000	I was just thinking that earlier today.
2265000	2267000	Are you a Scud fan, Kumail?
2267000	2269000	I haven't actually read Scud.
2269000	2270000	Oh, Christ.
2270000	2272000	You don't have to read it.
2272000	2273000	It's a picture book.
2273000	2275000	Can I take that again?
2275000	2276000	Can you ask me the question again?
2276000	2277000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2277000	2278000	Give me another take.
2278000	2280000	Are you a Scud fan, Kumail?
2280000	2281000	Not really.
2281000	2282000	Fuck.
2282000	2284000	One more time.
2284000	2286000	This is the worst.
2286000	2289000	I am a huge fan of Rob's.
2289000	2292000	Before I met you, I watched...
2292000	2294000	I can't remember the name of it.
2294000	2296000	But that Channel 101 thing you did,
2296000	2298000	which was the...
2298000	2299000	The answering machine thing.
2299000	2301000	You liked that quite a bit.
2301000	2302000	Yeah.
2302000	2304000	I would listen to it with all my ex-girlfriends.
2305000	2306000	To punish them.
2306000	2307000	Twiggers Holiday.
2307000	2308000	Yeah.
2308000	2309000	It blew me away.
2309000	2311000	I was visiting LA.
2311000	2312000	Is it online?
2312000	2313000	Can they watch it somewhere?
2313000	2314000	Yeah, I think so.
2314000	2315000	Twiggers Holiday.
2315000	2316000	Twiggers.
2316000	2317000	Oh, damn.
2317000	2319000	Is it Twiggers Holiday?
2319000	2320000	What?
2320000	2322000	Listen, I love Twiggers Holiday.
2322000	2323000	I love Scord.
2323000	2325000	I love everything you've done.
2325000	2326000	Scord!
2326000	2327000	Scord.
2327000	2329000	All the stuff.
2329000	2332000	I just want to say,
2332000	2334000	like a couple of weeks ago, I go,
2334000	2336000	hey, it's the 20th anniversary of mine
2336000	2338000	if I hand out some Scord books at your show.
2338000	2339000	Fuck it, man.
2339000	2341000	I'll put you on stage.
2341000	2343000	I mean, is that what you...
2343000	2345000	Is this a trap?
2348000	2350000	You gotta make fun of me?
2350000	2351000	No.
2351000	2353000	Your audience that loves you?
2353000	2355000	What if it was Dan saying...
2355000	2356000	The whole point was like,
2356000	2358000	okay, we never got it published.
2358000	2360000	We just made those two.
2360000	2362000	I've been sending you checks.
2363000	2365000	Also, I wasn't dating anyone
2365000	2367000	when you gave me that tape.
2367000	2369000	I didn't think it was a very good
2369000	2371000	answering machine compilation.
2372000	2374000	I found the edits were sloppy.
2374000	2376000	Hold on, let me finish.
2378000	2379000	But I really like, like,
2379000	2382000	are you gonna color the book at some point?
2385000	2387000	Because I noticed Spawn was always so colorful.
2387000	2388000	Yeah, that too.
2388000	2389000	Spawn's the best.
2390000	2392000	Is this like Spawn?
2392000	2394000	I fucking love Spawn, bro.
2394000	2396000	But if you do them in color,
2396000	2397000	you don't get to also sell them
2397000	2399000	in the coloring book section.
2399000	2401000	So it gives you twice the...
2401000	2403000	Are you gonna do anything about this?
2403000	2405000	You didn't do anything about this.
2405000	2407000	You started this shit.
2407000	2409000	Is there a pop-up version of the book?
2409000	2411000	Is there a pop-up version of it?
2411000	2414000	And Neil's taping all of this too
2414000	2416000	for you to jerk off later on.
2417000	2419000	I fucking love it.
2419000	2421000	I fucking love it.
2421000	2423000	I love ruining him.
2425000	2426000	I got a shoot tomorrow.
2426000	2428000	I'm gonna be groggy for a little bit.
2428000	2429000	What are you shooting tomorrow?
2429000	2430000	What are you shooting tomorrow?
2430000	2432000	I'm shooting Mindy Project tomorrow.
2433000	2434000	Nice.
2437000	2439000	Kind of like Skud.
2439000	2441000	Are you, like, shadowing somebody?
2441000	2443000	Get the fuck out of here.
2443000	2445000	Get the fuck out of here.
2445000	2446000	You made him come in early.
2446000	2448000	You didn't even talk to the anonymous.
2448000	2450000	Early. There's no format to the show.
2450000	2452000	I didn't know they had an internship program.
2456000	2459000	Well, definitely don't tell them about the comic book.
2460000	2463000	Just, you know, follow the guy.
2463000	2465000	I mean, you make it funny.
2465000	2466000	Your reactions make it funny.
2466000	2467000	Yeah.
2467000	2469000	My reactions on the podcast make it funny.
2469000	2471000	My facial expression.
2471000	2472000	Well, yeah.
2472000	2474000	I mean, I'm laughing right now.
2474000	2475000	Well, okay.
2475000	2478000	So for people who are listening on the podcast, he's crying.
2479000	2480000	And that's funny.
2480000	2481000	That's why it's so funny.
2481000	2483000	Because liquid's usually supposed to come out of a fuckset.
2483000	2485000	He's a fucking cocksucker.
2486000	2488000	Liquids come out of a fusset.
2488000	2491000	When they come out of people's eyes, it's so funny to me.
2492000	2495000	We don't even recognize expressions.
2495000	2499000	Look, water is leaking from their eyes.
2499000	2501000	They're called tears.
2501000	2504000	It is a symbol of their species' weakness.
2505000	2507000	That's what they think.
2507000	2508000	Flash Gordon.
2508000	2509000	Make the merciless.
2509000	2511000	Make the merciless at that.
2512000	2513000	Is that a movie you want?
2513000	2514000	No.
2514000	2516000	In all seriousness.
2516000	2517000	Here we go.
2517000	2518000	In all seriousness.
2518000	2520000	Now it's going to start getting gay.
2520000	2522000	In all seriousness.
2522000	2525000	Congratulations on getting The Mindy Project.
2527000	2528000	That makes it worse, doesn't it?
2528000	2530000	Doesn't that make it worse?
2530000	2531000	Yeah, no.
2531000	2532000	That makes it much worse.
2533000	2535000	Well, this is like your fourth time directing.
2535000	2536000	I know.
2536000	2537000	He's so proficient.
2537000	2539000	I've seen him direct up close and personal.
2539000	2540000	He's bonafide now.
2540000	2542000	Did you say he's so proficient?
2543000	2544000	Did I?
2545000	2547000	We watched it with you, the one episode.
2547000	2549000	And it was fucking fantastic.
2549000	2550000	You're...
2551000	2553000	It is worth when we're sincere.
2553000	2554000	I know it's worth it.
2554000	2555000	We should go back to...
2555000	2556000	No, it looked like Mindy the whole time.
2556000	2557000	I could see everybody.
2557000	2559000	Dude, everything was in focus.
2560000	2563000	Their lips and the words that were coming out of their lips were like,
2563000	2564000	synced up.
2567000	2570000	Remember when I sat in there before you came out?
2570000	2571000	Remember I said,
2571000	2572000	Hey, do me a favor.
2572000	2575000	I'm worried that no one's going to give a shit about my comic book.
2575000	2577000	It's, you know, it's been a long time.
2577000	2578000	Hey, man.
2578000	2579000	Throw me a couple of bones here and there.
2579000	2580000	Yeah.
2580000	2581000	Okay.
2581000	2583000	I smell blood in the water, bro.
2584000	2585000	Yeah.
2585000	2586000	All right.
2586000	2587000	Seriously.
2588000	2590000	Every time you say seriously...
2590000	2592000	I will say this seriously, folks.
2594000	2595000	When I met you,
2595000	2598000	I was very intimidated because of Twiggers Holiday.
2598000	2600000	Because you guys should go watch this.
2600000	2602000	And the death cap for cutie video is so...
2602000	2604000	It's like one of the best things I've ever seen.
2604000	2605000	Thank you.
2605000	2606000	Go watch it.
2606000	2607000	It's called Crooked Teeth.
2607000	2608000	What's it called?
2608000	2609000	Crooked Teeth?
2609000	2610000	Crooked Teeth.
2610000	2611000	Crooked Teeth.
2611000	2612000	Crooked Teeth.
2612000	2613000	Crooked Teeth.
2613000	2614000	Crooked Teeth.
2614000	2615000	Crooked Teeth.
2615000	2616000	Come on.
2616000	2617000	Let's get back to making them cry.
2617000	2618000	Yeah.
2619000	2620000	To non-prays.
2620000	2622000	How do you know when you're a good TV director?
2622000	2624000	You just leave the set and it's not on fire?
2628000	2630000	It's an artless craft.
2632000	2634000	As far as I'm concerned.
2635000	2637000	I just don't have time to do it.
2638000	2640000	I think it's that there's no story happening
2640000	2642000	during the commercial break.
2642000	2644000	That's how you did a good job.
2646000	2648000	It's television.
2650000	2652000	It's the opiate of the masses.
2654000	2656000	It's like just marshmallow fluff.
2657000	2661000	Anyways, you did a very good job this season.
2662000	2663000	Why is this so fun?
2664000	2666000	Because he's a great straight man.
2666000	2667000	He knows what he's doing.
2667000	2669000	He's a fucking Abbott.
2671000	2672000	Abbott got paid more than Costello
2672000	2675000	because it takes more talent to sit and fume.
2676000	2677000	It's funnier.
2677000	2678000	That's where the laugh comes from.
2678000	2679000	Don't butter it up, man.
2680000	2681000	Don't butter it.
2681000	2682000	No, no, no.
2682000	2685000	You're really great at letting me shit on you.
2687000	2688000	He's a great shit.
2688000	2690000	The audience loves everything I do anyway.
2691000	2692000	Come on out here.
2693000	2695000	These people do not love everything I do anyway.
2696000	2697000	At any particular time,
2697000	2699000	one of them will lunge out of the audience,
2699000	2701000	come up on stage and tell me I should shut the fuck up.
2701000	2703000	Why are you up here doing something right now?
2703000	2705000	No, no, no, bro, bro.
2706000	2707000	They will.
2707000	2708000	Seriously.
2708000	2709000	They will.
2709000	2711000	You're always interrupting shit at the wrong time,
2711000	2713000	interrupt him making fun of me.
2714000	2716000	I notice you're super quiet now.
2716000	2718000	It's our turn in the barrel shop.
2719000	2721000	It's a very challenging thing.
2721000	2722000	Shut up.
2722000	2723000	It's like you don't want to say,
2723000	2724000	I'd like to see you write an episode of a sitcom
2724000	2726000	because then they will and everyone will realize,
2726000	2727000	oh, anyone can do it.
2729000	2730000	It is pretty easy.
2730000	2733000	Dude, I just got a text to direct an episode of the Mindy Project.
2735000	2736000	Great.
2736000	2740000	I hope, you know, I'm going to, you know what?
2740000	2741000	You're going to stop, right?
2741000	2743000	I'm going to pass on.
2744000	2746000	I like that Ike Barron holds.
2746000	2747000	He's funny.
2747000	2748000	Very funny.
2748000	2749000	Does Mindy know you're going to?
2749000	2750000	He's like Donald Glover funny.
2750000	2751000	Yeah.
2751000	2752000	Yeah.
2752000	2753000	I like him a lot.
2753000	2754000	Chris Pacino's great too.
2754000	2756000	I just met him two days ago.
2756000	2757000	He's really good on that show.
2757000	2758000	Chris is super cool.
2758000	2759000	On that and his room.
2759000	2760000	He's really great.
2760000	2761000	And Mindy's great too.
2761000	2762000	I don't know.
2762000	2763000	Yeah.
2763000	2764000	I'm not suffering the illusion.
2764000	2766000	She's sitting here listening in her bathtub.
2766000	2767000	You didn't mention me.
2767000	2768000	Come on.
2768000	2769000	Come on.
2769000	2770000	Say my name.
2770000	2771000	Come on.
2771000	2772000	Come on.
2772000	2773000	When will my name be mentioned?
2776000	2780000	But no, I, well, she's, she's, she, she runs the show and she had,
2780000	2783000	she had the wisdom to walk into a writer's room with Ike Barron Holtz and
2783000	2786000	then immediately grab him and yank him,
2786000	2790000	throw him onto camera because he, I really, I really, he was, I,
2790000	2792000	I feel like I've seen him in things before.
2792000	2793000	Oh, I'm not sure.
2793000	2794000	He wasn't things.
2794000	2795000	He acts and writes and stuff.
2795000	2798000	This is by far for the first big thing.
2798000	2799000	I think he's so good.
2799000	2800000	Yeah.
2800000	2801000	He's on Eastbound.
2801000	2802000	He was on.
2802000	2803000	He was great on that.
2803000	2804000	Yeah.
2804000	2805000	He's like Glover where he just like, Oh, fuck you.
2805000	2806000	You're so funny.
2806000	2809000	This is turning more into just a conversation and lesson to an interesting
2809000	2810000	conversation.
2810000	2815000	I just want to, as the comptroller, can I say, by the way, like we should now talk
2815000	2817000	about transhumanism or get into a whole.
2817000	2818000	No, no, no.
2818000	2820000	No, let's talk about gender.
2820000	2824000	I feel like we didn't really figure that one out.
2824000	2829000	We haven't covered what's wrong with the woman's body.
2829000	2832000	By the way, what parts of the, what parts of that sag?
2832000	2833000	Don't make sense.
2833000	2836000	There's three glaring mistakes.
2836000	2838000	No, I'm not going to go there.
2838000	2839000	What are they?
2839000	2842000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2842000	2845000	I think one of the biggest problems with the design of the balls is that they
2845000	2848000	are the perfect kicking height too.
2848000	2852000	Like low enough that everyone can get to it, but high enough that you get good
2852000	2854000	momentum going.
2854000	2856000	It's a really terrible design.
2856000	2859000	If they were on the foot, you wouldn't get hurt as much.
2859000	2860000	Yeah.
2860000	2861000	Why are there two of them also?
2861000	2864000	Just give me one terrible thing on my body.
2864000	2866000	Or don't put them next to each other.
2866000	2867000	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2867000	2868000	Two.
2868000	2870000	Separate them.
2871000	2873000	Do you just have one big grapefruit one?
2873000	2875000	No, you have it.
2875000	2878000	Well, there's one scrotum holding two little things in there, yeah.
2878000	2880000	I've never looked that close.
2880000	2882000	It's all about that bilateral symmetry.
2882000	2886000	It's such a strange, but I guess effective thing.
2886000	2888000	Like everything got divided.
2888000	2889000	Oh, is it like redundancy?
2889000	2891000	Is it like one eye goes the other way?
2891000	2892000	Well, yeah.
2892000	2893000	Well, your eyes.
2893000	2894000	Should I move?
2894000	2895000	Do you want to sit here?
2895000	2896000	No, no, no.
2896000	2897000	You're doing this a lot.
2897000	2898000	No.
2898000	2901000	Well, I can make eye contact with everybody.
2901000	2904000	That's not you on stage, so.
2907000	2909000	What's on your shirt?
2912000	2913000	What is this?
2913000	2916000	Is this a detergent that's coming out?
2917000	2919000	But, you know, we started biologically, obviously,
2919000	2921000	as like these unicellular organisms.
2921000	2923000	Look at this guy.
2923000	2925000	Well, the face itself comes around from the back.
2925000	2926000	It's true.
2926000	2928000	By the way it embryologically comes together,
2928000	2930000	it like goes around the back and meets in the middle.
2930000	2931000	The thing that blows my mind.
2931000	2932000	So this is just the seam.
2932000	2934000	The nose is basically the seam,
2934000	2936000	the part that you would sort of clip off.
2936000	2939000	And your mouth is a through line.
2939000	2940000	Oh, sorry.
2940000	2943000	Oh, yeah, the mouth goes exactly your ass.
2943000	2944000	Because you're a worm.
2944000	2947000	We're all worms or donuts.
2947000	2950000	Like the first multicellular organisms are just, you know,
2950000	2955000	they're just trying to optimize the surface area
2955000	2957000	to digest it.
2957000	2961000	Yeah, so like you're and everything you eat,
2961000	2964000	you're rubbing up against with the outside of your body.
2964000	2966000	It's just that advanced organisms,
2966000	2968000	we have a part of the outside of our body.
2968000	2971000	We're like these balloon animals.
2971000	2976000	We're like we're part of the outside of our body is inside our body.
2976000	2978000	Well, you know why we eat a donut.
2978000	2982000	It's moving and rubbing up against like the outside of your body.
2982000	2985000	Donuts eating donuts, huh?
2985000	2987000	You're not going anywhere, bro.
2987000	2991000	No, do you know why we stand direct?
2991000	2993000	Because of capitalism.
2993000	2995000	Because of capitalism.
2995000	2996000	Because of 9-11.
2996000	2998000	Because we really love the show.
2998000	3003000	No, because it's less surface area for the sun to hit.
3003000	3005000	Oh, so that we don't get overheated.
3005000	3008000	So we could be out at like noon when all the other animals were inside.
3008000	3010000	I mean, that's one crazy theory.
3011000	3014000	The most amazing thing about us walking erect
3014000	3019000	is that it's probably the most dramatic change in evolutionary,
3019000	3021000	well, certainly in our evolutionary history.
3021000	3022000	Certainly in our lifetime.
3022000	3028000	The amount of time it took the human species to go from,
3028000	3032000	to start walking erect, that amount of pelvic shift
3032000	3038000	in the amount of time that it happened is so dramatic.
3038000	3041000	Well, Camille, would you mind kind of showing us?
3041000	3043000	Take us through the stages.
3043000	3044000	Why me?
3044000	3047000	I just seem really talented physically.
3047000	3049000	And I'd love to just show.
3049000	3051000	It's not to humiliate you in any way.
3051000	3053000	Just go ahead and get down on your knees there, buddy.
3053000	3057000	I would throw myself through the evolution of it.
3057000	3059000	You can just say you're doing it.
3059000	3061000	Hey, Timann, you can stop it, if you're embarrassed.
3061000	3062000	I would stop it.
3062000	3064000	It's better what Schwab was doing.
3064000	3065000	No, no, no, no, no.
3065000	3067000	No, no, it's not a Schwab thing.
3067000	3070000	By the way, I heard, and what I do is,
3070000	3073000	when I hear a great theory about evolution,
3073000	3075000	I don't look it up because I want it to be magical,
3075000	3079000	is that our brains got too smart,
3079000	3082000	so that's why we all have back problems.
3082000	3086000	You're disproving your theory as you make your theory.
3086000	3089000	Our brains got too smart.
3089000	3095000	Like, okay, well, it's not that.
3095000	3098000	Wait, am I the new Schwab?
3098000	3100000	No.
3100000	3105000	Let's bring out Rob Schwab, everybody.
3105000	3108000	Status change, status change.
3108000	3110000	Do we answer college?
3110000	3112000	Schwab?
3112000	3114000	That's right, Rob, yay!
3114000	3115000	You got Schwab.
3115000	3119000	Is that our brains got too smart, too quickly,
3119000	3121000	and so that's why we have back problems,
3121000	3123000	is that it would have made more sense for the back
3123000	3124000	to be completely straight,
3124000	3126000	but we figured out ways to sort of go around that,
3126000	3128000	so we never evolved people.
3128000	3131000	No, no, no, we disagree about this.
3131000	3133000	Well, so does all of anthropological society.
3133000	3135000	That's the beautiful thing about it.
3135000	3138000	You can't get a straight answer about this.
3138000	3139000	There is no straight answer.
3139000	3141000	But here's an answer that's kind of interesting
3141000	3142000	about how we were around.
3142000	3144000	Homo sapiens...
3144000	3146000	Homo sapiens.
3146000	3147000	We were around...
3147000	3149000	That word cracks me up.
3149000	3152000	Homo sapiens were around at the same time as Neanderthals,
3152000	3154000	and Neanderthals, they discovered,
3154000	3155000	were actually more intelligent,
3155000	3158000	like by brain mass versus body weight,
3158000	3159000	which is really how you do it, right?
3159000	3161000	They had religion first.
3161000	3163000	They dug up Neanderthals.
3163000	3166000	No, interestingly, they did not have creativity.
3166000	3167000	And that's right.
3167000	3170000	That's where we were the ones making cave paintings
3170000	3172000	and then language and the written word
3172000	3177000	and then Scott, the disposable assassin, turned to 20.
3177000	3181000	And it was that gene for creativity
3181000	3184000	that allowed us to wipe out the Neanderthals, basically,
3184000	3186000	because we could pass along what we learned.
3186000	3189000	But I think it's incredibly important
3189000	3193000	that also Neanderthals,
3193000	3198000	they couldn't find any Cro-Magnon burial sites
3198000	3202000	that had any, well, burial sites period.
3202000	3205000	Neanderthals, burial sites everywhere,
3205000	3208000	and with all of them like items,
3208000	3211000	which indicates like some kind of connection
3211000	3213000	to the concept of death.
3213000	3215000	Oh, absolutely.
3215000	3217000	Which is so interesting when you think about,
3217000	3219000	like, okay, Cro-Magnons, we're creating like these,
3219000	3221000	we hunted them to extinction.
3221000	3225000	I say we, like, hey, we're the packers.
3225000	3228000	That's exactly, that's such a great...
3228000	3230000	We hunted Neanderthals to extinction
3230000	3234000	because we basically created like ranged weapons,
3235000	3238000	we threw, started throwing shit at things.
3238000	3239000	We made, Scott gave it to them,
3239000	3242000	and they were so enthralled in how good it was
3242000	3244000	that then we murdered them.
3244000	3246000	But it's interesting the idea that, yes, also,
3246000	3248000	there is no Neanderthal, as far as we know it,
3248000	3250000	there's no Neanderthal cave paintings
3250000	3253000	that Cro-Magnons were starting to,
3253000	3255000	so this is what really disturbs me,
3255000	3258000	the idea that it's possible to be creative
3258000	3261000	but have no emotional attachment to people who die,
3261000	3263000	which is like a sociopathic,
3263000	3264000	we know a lot of artists like this.
3264000	3266000	Well, that's why, because the Cro-Magnons were very creative
3266000	3268000	and a lot of their sitcoms were very funny.
3268000	3271000	Yeah, they wanted to reach a lot of people,
3271000	3273000	but they didn't give a fuck if you die.
3273000	3274000	Yeah, they don't care.
3274000	3275000	I don't like them.
3275000	3277000	It was all multi-cave shit, though.
3277000	3278000	It was all...
3278000	3279000	Mocap?
3279000	3280000	Multicam shit.
3280000	3282000	It was like motion capture.
3282000	3287000	It was all multi-cave, like dumb.
3287000	3289000	Oh, I'm doing a single cave.
3289000	3292000	You go into one chamber and you build one fire,
3292000	3293000	but it's like more personal.
3293000	3295000	It's like you look here and you look there.
3295000	3296000	It's up to you.
3296000	3297000	Yeah, I don't like it.
3297000	3298000	I know.
3298000	3299000	Yeah, the audience.
3299000	3301000	The Cro-Magnons have multi-cave.
3301000	3302000	I understand.
3302000	3303000	Everyone go in.
3303000	3304000	Everyone laugh.
3304000	3305000	Why not go back and laugh?
3305000	3306000	I know why you laugh.
3306000	3307000	I hear.
3307000	3312000	I hear when funny, even when not funny.
3312000	3317000	And we all, Whitey, still has a lot of Neanderthal genes in us.
3317000	3318000	That's the other thing, didn't we?
3318000	3319000	All right.
3319000	3320000	Which Africans don't have.
3320000	3321000	I have a little moment here.
3321000	3324000	About all the great things you people have.
3324000	3326000	We have everything, Kumail.
3326000	3327000	Everything.
3327000	3328000	Including drones.
3328000	3331000	So everybody shut the fuck up.
3331000	3333000	Do you have keyless entry?
3333000	3335000	We have keyless entry.
3335000	3337000	Do you have waterproof iPads?
3337000	3340000	No, by the way, I can't think of a greater present than that.
3340000	3341000	That's so nice.
3341000	3342000	That is amazing.
3342000	3345000	Also, somebody else, somebody pointed out on Twitter,
3345000	3347000	she's just doing it to keep me clean.
3347000	3350000	She's like luring me into the tub like a dog.
3350000	3351000	Really interesting.
3351000	3352000	Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.
3352000	3353000	That's right.
3353000	3356000	It's like a dog thinking like, hey, there's always like a treat
3356000	3358000	in the back of that cage on the way to the place
3358000	3359000	where they give me the shots.
3359000	3360000	Yeah.
3360000	3361000	Exactly.
3361000	3366000	The trail of donuts and then a waterproof iPad.
3366000	3368000	But so Cro-Magnons fucked Neanderthals.
3368000	3370000	We didn't just hunt them to extinction.
3370000	3372000	We fucked, right?
3372000	3373000	Well, I don't know.
3373000	3374000	I don't think Cro-Magnons and Homo sapiens
3374000	3376000	were together at the same time.
3376000	3377000	I don't think so.
3377000	3379000	What's the difference between Homo sapiens and Cro-Magnons?
3379000	3383000	We're all missing very important pieces of information.
3383000	3384000	PhDs.
3384000	3389000	The Homo sapiens just make shit up.
3389000	3392000	This is what we have, creativity.
3392000	3396000	Those sapiens have podcasts and fucking overzealousness.
3396000	3399000	I feel like what makes sense is that they were fucking.
3399000	3402000	That's probably it.
3402000	3405000	Which one of them had bronto burgers?
3406000	3408000	Which one of them had cars that would tip over
3408000	3410000	the ribs or tubing?
3410000	3412000	That would have been interesting to go back
3412000	3416000	and do Flintstones with what we know now about those people
3416000	3420000	and just, you know, the rape.
3420000	3423000	All animals have rape, by the way.
3423000	3424000	The caveman.
3424000	3428000	You put a comma on that and then ended the sentence.
3428000	3431000	Just what we know about the rape.
3431000	3433000	By the way, what's great about Flintstones?
3433000	3436000	It was like a lot of consenting caveman sex.
3436000	3439000	What's great about Flintstones is that it was animated
3439000	3442000	but it still had a laugh track.
3442000	3445000	So there's somebody drawing it and like, wait, wait, wait.
3445000	3446000	This is what it is.
3446000	3447000	And then people laughed?
3447000	3452000	The audience had to laugh really slow.
3452000	3455000	I'm sure the audience was animated too.
3455000	3456000	Think about MASH.
3456000	3460000	During its 11 year run, MASH was a single camera comedy
3460000	3464000	based on a Robert Altman film with a theme song
3464000	3467000	called Suicide is Painless, which they kept.
3467000	3469000	And I was like, well, we don't want to lose that.
3469000	3472000	Suicide is painless.
3472000	3475000	Single camera comedy about a war, about doctors
3475000	3477000	patching people together, literally having blood
3477000	3479000	spraying on their face.
3479000	3482000	It was always single camera, but sometimes it had a laugh track
3482000	3484000	and sometimes it didn't.
3484000	3485000	It didn't in the operating room.
3485000	3487000	That was the distinction they made.
3487000	3489000	When you're operating on a movie, when you pretend operating,
3489000	3490000	I mean, that's not a joke.
3490000	3492000	So they're still doing bits though.
3492000	3494000	They're still doing bits.
3494000	3496000	But there's blood spraying on their face.
3496000	3498000	You know that I just sold 12 Years a Slave over at Fox, right?
3498000	3501000	As a comedy, Kevin Hart.
3501000	3505000	Kevin Hart?
3505000	3508000	I don't know how, but that's the most horrible thing I've ever heard.
3508000	3510000	Oh, it's going to be funny.
3510000	3511000	We're not going to...
3511000	3513000	I mean, we're going to keep some of this stuff and keep slave
3513000	3514000	and all that stuff.
3514000	3515000	Right.
3515000	3516000	But it's going to be funny.
3516000	3517000	But he likes it.
3517000	3519000	It's not seasons though.
3519000	3521000	It's limited.
3521000	3523000	You can only run 12 seasons.
3523000	3526000	You worked a lot of Home Alone elements into it.
3526000	3532000	He's trying to stop being a slave and there's bumbling slave owners trying to...
3532000	3535000	Where are these two slave owners?
3535000	3537000	They bonk heads.
3537000	3540000	And he uses a MacGyver-like kind of intuition to...
3540000	3542000	That's the whole joke of the thing.
3542000	3545000	He's so much smarter than them and they're always falling in the trap.
3545000	3546000	Because he's still, you know, slave.
3546000	3547000	It's like, give the Gonzales.
3547000	3552000	12 years of slave and then we're going to do two years as a real estate executive.
3552000	3554000	Just for international.
3554000	3558000	Yeah, just because we lost some of the cast and we wanted to hit that 14 year mark.
3558000	3562000	So it'll be like 12 years of slave, two years, and all the way back home.
3562000	3567000	Two years of real estate executive?
3567000	3568000	I don't know if...
3568000	3570000	That's our after-mesh, you know?
3570000	3574000	I don't know if Kevin Hart can pull off real estate executives.
3574000	3580000	When they did after-mesh, none of these kids know what we're talking about.
3580000	3581000	No, they don't.
3581000	3582000	What is after-mesh?
3582000	3583000	They're probably similarly aware of it.
3583000	3584000	They know there was a show called MASH.
3584000	3585000	It was based on the Korean word.
3585000	3587000	Who knows about MASH?
3587000	3589000	Okay, okay, okay.
3589000	3591000	The show MASH lasted 11 years.
3591000	3593000	Okay, now who's seen it?
3593000	3596000	Same people.
3596000	3602000	So there was a multi-camera show that they aired for six episodes called After MASH.
3602000	3606000	About like three of the MASH characters moving into an apartment together.
3606000	3607000	The most popular ones, right?
3607000	3608000	The best ones, the ones you want.
3608000	3609000	The best ones.
3609000	3610000	Well, okay.
3610000	3611000	Hot guy?
3611000	3612000	No.
3612000	3613000	No, not radar.
3613000	3614000	No, sorry.
3614000	3615000	Hot lips?
3615000	3617000	Okay, Clinger, Father Mokehi, and Colonel Potter.
3617000	3619000	And they moved into an apartment.
3619000	3622000	Colonel Potter only had to do two out of every six.
3622000	3627000	But I Wikipedia'd it recently and it was like, did After MASH really happen?
3627000	3634000	I Wikipedia'd it and they talked about the fact that they were promoting it because they were up against the A-Team.
3634000	3644000	So they had these promotions where Clinger was shaving a mohawk off of a guy who had his back turned to camera.
3644000	3646000	Yeah, they're like, I'll take your mohawk.
3646000	3648000	We're going to fuck you up, A-Team.
3648000	3652000	Was Clinger a barber in the way?
3652000	3656000	There was the presumption that he was always removing a lot of hair from his body.
3656000	3657000	Right.
3657000	3660000	Because he was Lebanese, so he was in a drag.
3660000	3662000	What were the characters that they introduced?
3662000	3664000	I mean, there wasn't three people.
3664000	3665000	Was it not in the Korean War?
3665000	3666000	Where are they now?
3666000	3670000	It takes place in the After MASH of the Korean War.
3670000	3674000	It took place in America, like they went back home.
3674000	3680000	Well, that's the weird thing because, of course, as we know, the Korean War lasted, what, 20 years?
3680000	3681000	Korean War is two years, right?
3681000	3684000	Yeah, and the series lasted 11 years.
3685000	3689000	Which is why Sony is always so frustrated with me.
3689000	3691000	They're like, look, this isn't rocket science.
3691000	3694000	It's okay that he said he needed a four-year degree.
3694000	3697000	Just fucking make a TV show until we're all dead.
3697000	3698000	Right, right.
3698000	3700000	I wanted to make a sitcom that was...
3700000	3702000	It'll be too late for a refund.
3702000	3704000	We've established they're not very late.
3704000	3706000	You'll have their money.
3706000	3710000	You know, I did Golden Palace, so I have to recuse myself from this conversation.
3710000	3711000	What's Golden Palace?
3711000	3718000	Golden Palace, it does sound like a Chinese restaurant, but it was the spin-off of the Golden Girls with three of the Golden Girls.
3718000	3719000	Don Cheadle.
3719000	3721000	What the fuck are you talking about?
3721000	3722000	What are you seriously talking about?
3722000	3724000	He worked on Golden Girls.
3724000	3726000	I worked on the Golden Girls as a young man, and then they...
3726000	3727000	What was your...
3727000	3729000	You played Young Man?
3729000	3730000	Yeah, I was the young man.
3730000	3731000	Young Man number two.
3731000	3732000	Okay.
3732000	3734000	Not so funny, mister.
3734000	3735000	What's that?
3735000	3736000	Get a cheese?
3736000	3737000	Come on, guys.
3737000	3739000	Don't treat me like I'm a fucking shrub over here, okay?
3739000	3740000	I've been doing this...
3740000	3741000	Yeah, yeah.
3741000	3742000	You haven't...
3742000	3743000	I know.
3743000	3744000	Hey, Mitch, what was your rank on Golden Girls?
3744000	3745000	So, well, here's the...
3745000	3746000	Golden Girls was low-level.
3746000	3749000	I think it got up to producer or something, which sounds high-level, but...
3749000	3750000	That's high-level.
3750000	3752000	I know, it sounds like it, but it's really...
3752000	3754000	But then, in this new show...
3754000	3756000	You were overlord on the rest of development, right?
3756000	3757000	Underlord.
3757000	3758000	Okay.
3763000	3764000	Jacklord.
3764000	3765000	I was...
3765000	3766000	No, so there's a...
3766000	3767000	Oh, great.
3767000	3768000	I know.
3768000	3769000	This is the rehearsal, right?
3769000	3771000	When do we do the actual...
3771000	3775000	So, anyway, they have the Golden Girls, three of the Golden Girls...
3775000	3776000	B leaves.
3776000	3777000	B. Arthur leaves.
3777000	3778000	And...
3778000	3780000	The Donald Glover of the Golden Girls.
3780000	3781000	Of the Golden Girls.
3781000	3785000	And I was suggesting they bring in, like, Tony Randall or something like that, but they said,
3785000	3786000	no, we have a better idea.
3786000	3789000	And the idea was the Golden Girls are broke, right?
3789000	3790000	They have no money.
3790000	3793000	So, they buy a $30 million hotel.
3793000	3794000	They're silver girls.
3794000	3799000	They buy a $30 million hotel in Miami, and then they have to, you know, they have to
3799000	3803000	clean the rooms themselves and that kind of thing, because they just spent that $30 million.
3803000	3806000	But it was the three remaining Golden Girls...
3806000	3808000	So, it's like faulty towers meets Golden Girls.
3808000	3809000	Right.
3809000	3810000	With Don Cheadle.
3810000	3811000	Of course.
3811000	3813000	As Mayshak Taylor.
3813000	3814000	Oh, wait, no, he was deciding one.
3814000	3815000	Yes, in a funny way, right?
3815000	3817000	And Cheech Marin.
3817000	3818000	No.
3818000	3819000	Yeah.
3819000	3820000	Yeah.
3820000	3821000	I like that.
3821000	3822000	It's just really good.
3822000	3823000	This actually sounds great so far.
3823000	3824000	Yeah, that's it.
3824000	3825000	That's it.
3825000	3826000	We did a whole season of that.
3826000	3827000	And how...
3827000	3830360	Don Cheadle said, you know, in that super real Don Cheadle way, saying, okay, now hold
3830360	3831360	on, girls.
3831360	3832360	Wait a second.
3832360	3833360	Which goes...
3833360	3836760	Rose, you really like this guy.
3836760	3837760	Tell him.
3837760	3840760	It doesn't matter if he's older than you.
3840760	3845200	That sounds ahead of its time, because I immediately thought of Mayshak Taylor, who...
3845200	3847480	But then realized, oh, no, that's not Golden Girls.
3847480	3851880	That's designing women, which is so many years later, and still the black guy in your sitcom
3851880	3852880	had to be...
3852880	3857360	In that case, I think he was playing a gay guy, but he was certainly...
3857360	3858360	He was very...
3858360	3859360	In Golden Palace?
3859360	3860360	No, no, no, no.
3860360	3861360	No, in Mayshak.
3861360	3862360	Yeah.
3862360	3863360	Yeah.
3863360	3864360	Yeah.
3864360	3868080	It's been a long time coming for black people on sitcoms to...
3868080	3873400	It's either you're doing black sitcoms, and it's like, hey, it's Uncle Martin's place.
3873400	3876520	Or it's like you're a white sitcom.
3876520	3878320	We have not learned how to do sitcoms together.
3878320	3885560	Well, in fairness, it's because white people kind of have no right to make black people
3885560	3886560	funny.
3886560	3888480	It really almost comes down to that.
3888480	3889480	You can make them dumb.
3889480	3891280	You can make them smart.
3891280	3892880	Anything is kind of offensive, right?
3892880	3893880	When it comes from...
3893880	3894880	Sure.
3894880	3898520	Although there was a famous story about Red Fox during San Fran Sun, who wanted to get
3898520	3901280	rid of all the white writers.
3901280	3906080	And so he had a whole African-American writing team, and then they had a table read.
3906080	3910520	And then at the end of it, he yelled, bring me my Jews.
3910520	3914560	Two stories.
3914560	3915560	Which is a great way to look at it.
3915560	3916560	It's like, they're my Jews.
3916560	3922200	It's a great way to split the difference between white and black as white...
3922200	3926720	There's a historic significance to that idea that the Jews...
3926720	3927720	Are you Jewish?
3927720	3928720	I'm Jewish.
3928720	3929720	Yeah, I'm Jewish.
3929720	3930720	Jewish.
3930720	3931720	Yeah.
3931720	3934120	Which comes up every time I take a bath.
3934120	3935320	I'm confronted with that.
3935560	3942200	I'm confronted with this fucking giant black man's serum size.
3942200	3947920	But there's a historic significance to the idea that in the old days, entertainment along
3947920	3954800	with handling money and garments and all this stuff that became stereotypical, that was...
3954800	3955800	It was considered the realm of the Jews.
3955800	3956800	The realm of the Jews.
3956800	3957800	The upper class.
3957800	3958800	Yeah, all that stuff, right?
3958800	3960280	Like, oh, we're not going to handle that.
3960280	3961280	Banking.
3961280	3962680	I mean, all that stuff was like...
3963040	3965960	The idea that entertainment was considered one of that, it's dirty.
3965960	3967640	It's pornographic, basically.
3967640	3971640	Before there was pornography, entertainment was pornographic, like, oh, the idea of making
3971640	3972640	movies, making...
3972640	3973640	Is that really true?
3973640	3974640	Yeah.
3974640	3975640	Was it like that?
3975640	3976640	That's why there's such a heavy tradition of...
3976640	3977640	Underclass.
3977640	3980800	Like, Jewish fellows, I can't...
3980800	3983800	Like, they go where they stick their nose in it.
3983800	3985800	They go where they go where they let them.
3985800	3986800	Man, is that what you were going to say?
3986800	3987800	No.
3987800	3988800	They stick their nose into...
3988800	3991800	I'm pretty sure that's what I was going to say, man.
3991800	3992800	Unbelievable.
3992800	3993800	Don't make me the new shrapnel.
3993800	3994800	I'm pretty sure that's what he's going to say.
3994800	3995800	You know, they...
3995800	3996800	That's what we're just going to say.
3996800	3997800	That's what we're just going to say.
3997800	3998800	That's what we're just going to say.
3998800	3999800	That's what we're just going to say.
3999800	4000800	That's what we're just going to say.
4000800	4001800	That's what we're just going to say.
4001800	4002800	Historically, they've gone where we've let them go.
4002800	4003800	I said we.
4003800	4004800	The Cro-Magnons.
4004800	4005800	Let them go.
4005800	4006800	Yeah.
4006800	4011640	It was considered, like, beneath, like, proper people.
4011640	4013400	Only the heaps would do it?
4013400	4014400	Is that what you're about to say?
4014400	4015400	Well, yeah, that is what I'm going to say.
4015400	4016400	Unbelievable.
4016400	4017400	Pretty sure that's what he was saying.
4018400	4019400	Whoa, whoa, Rob.
4019400	4022400	Were you about to use the N-word?
4023400	4024400	Say it.
4024400	4025400	No.
4025400	4026400	That was Will Arnett.
4026400	4027400	Will Arnett did that to Jason.
4027400	4028400	That's Will's joke.
4028400	4031400	He was in a meeting with Jason Bateman in the middle of it.
4031400	4032400	He said, whoa, whoa.
4032400	4035400	Were you about to say the N-word?
4035400	4037400	And as Jason was saying no, he was like,
4037400	4040400	because that's not okay.
4040400	4043400	I'm not down with that.
4043400	4046400	And everybody, of course, just looked at Jason.
4047400	4048400	No.
4051400	4052400	All right, so.
4052400	4053400	The first try Jason takes.
4053400	4054400	Jews, black people, TV.
4054400	4056400	We'll figure it out.
4056400	4058400	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.
4068400	4070400	Hey, everybody.
4070400	4072400	What do you think about Jews and black people in TV?
4072400	4074400	I'm for them.
4077400	4079400	It's an incredibly condescending attitude.
4079400	4080400	That is, you can't win.
4080400	4081400	You're part of the problem.
4081400	4082400	You know that.
4082400	4085400	I'd like to think so.
4085400	4088400	You have the beard of a Talmudic scholar.
4088400	4089400	I was thinking that.
4089400	4093400	You know, around here there's a lot of Hasidic Jewish neighborhoods.
4093400	4094400	And I don't know.
4094400	4096400	I don't think they have long, not-beard hair.
4096400	4099400	But I always wonder when I'm walking amongst them,
4099400	4101400	like, do they know?
4101400	4102400	It pisses me off.
4102400	4105400	Do they know that you're just not one of them on having a really lazy day?
4105400	4106400	Yeah.
4106400	4109400	Because you're wearing a community t-shirt and no Indiana Jones hat.
4109400	4110400	Yeah.
4113400	4114400	Wait, what?
4114400	4115400	That's what they wear.
4115400	4116400	They're like Indiana Jones hats.
4116400	4117400	They wear those big hats.
4117400	4118400	Yeah.
4118400	4119400	The big square ones?
4119400	4120400	No, not the square ones.
4120400	4121400	They're like round.
4121400	4122400	Well, that makes me...
4122400	4123400	Indy wore a square one once.
4123400	4124400	All I can say is Indiana Jones hat.
4124400	4125400	Or you can't picture that?
4125400	4126400	What the fuck?
4126400	4128400	I never seen an Indiana Jones movie.
4128400	4131400	No, no, it's like an adventurer's...
4131400	4132400	They don't wear those.
4132400	4133400	I don't know.
4133400	4134400	It's like a black hat, but it's shaped like Indiana Jones hat.
4134400	4136400	That's a funny idea for an adventure movie.
4137400	4139400	But you have to get the hat under the...
4139400	4140400	Oy vey!
4142400	4146400	Of course, it's the tomb with all the gold that he has to go with.
4149400	4151400	Instead of snakes, it's just gold.
4151400	4153400	Why did it have to be gold?
4153400	4156400	I could say that because I'm anti-Semitic.
4156400	4157400	That's true.
4157400	4158400	That's right.
4158400	4159400	That's right.
4159400	4160400	That's fair.
4160400	4161400	It's just...
4162400	4163400	Who I am.
4166400	4167400	Yeah, but you could definitely...
4167400	4171400	Yeah, if you put a black Indiana Jones hat on a suit...
4171400	4172400	I kind of want to see that.
4172400	4174400	I figured that they didn't have long hair.
4174400	4178400	You see the ear locks and stuff, but their head hair is not that long?
4178400	4179400	That might be true.
4179400	4180400	Yeah, for all we know.
4180400	4181400	You can hide it in the hat.
4181400	4185400	Well, the beard might be reserved for...
4185400	4190400	I feel about those guys the way that a lot of gay people must feel about transvestites.
4191400	4193400	Like, really? We're in the same club?
4193400	4194400	This is...
4197400	4199400	I'm on your side in this.
4201400	4202400	Hey, treat us fairly.
4202400	4205400	And, you know, obviously the guy with the hat, too.
4206400	4207400	He's with us.
4208400	4214400	Or the gay person who's got to say, you know, and also that 60-year-old man who's dressed like a stewardess.
4215400	4216400	Be nice to him.
4217400	4223400	There's a lot in Brooklyn, in Williamsburg, which is a very Jewish neighborhood before it became all hipster.
4223400	4225400	There's like certain places where...
4225400	4228400	It's like a certain time, certain days of the week.
4228400	4229400	I don't know much about...
4229400	4233400	But there's only certain things you can do in the house, and you can't do them outside.
4233400	4235400	On the day of gahach is what you're thinking of.
4235400	4236400	Is that really...
4236400	4237400	The third day of gahach.
4237400	4239400	No, you're thinking of the Beastmaster movie.
4239400	4240400	Oh, right.
4241400	4246400	So they have like ropes from their house basically extending the boundary of their house.
4246400	4250400	So you go there and it's all like ropes around, so you could basically do everything.
4250400	4252400	I believe it. I don't know much about it.
4252400	4253400	There's all kinds of amazing...
4253400	4255400	I know more about Neanderthal.
4256400	4259400	Our mutual friend, Ryan Ridley, he became very...
4259400	4262400	Oh, yeah, he had that period. I blocked it out.
4262400	4265400	During that phase, I was really fascinated to hear about all the...
4265400	4267400	You went to Israel for a long time.
4268400	4270400	What crazy shit do you believe?
4270400	4273400	Shools and Shabashivas and stuff were about.
4277400	4279400	It's called Rosh Hashanaka.
4280400	4283400	The idea that you would have a day in the week for your religion,
4283400	4286400	where the idea was basically just put your fucking cell phone away.
4286400	4289400	Don't tweet. Don't...
4289400	4292400	You can have your neighbors come in and turn on your oven. That's the thing.
4292400	4295400	Well, yeah, if they're not... Yeah, like other people.
4295400	4297400	It's basically forcing your hand as a human being.
4297400	4299400	It's saying like, are you human or you're not...
4299400	4301400	It's such a cool... I don't know.
4303400	4307400	I think we've talked about this before, but it's like obviously Christianity took this route that was like,
4307400	4311400	holy shit, let's take over the world.
4311400	4316400	Let's have a Ronald McDonald and let's have a corporate headquarters and let's franchise.
4316400	4320400	And let's have pretty low requirements for our franchise.
4320400	4323400	You know what we should do? We should pass around a plate.
4323400	4328400	Whatever you want, we're not looking, just God is who will decide what happens to you.
4328400	4330400	But whatever you want...
4330400	4334400	And I think people who fetishize Judaism ideologically like I do,
4334400	4337400	what you're fetishizing is the idea of keeping it in the community,
4337400	4339400	which has obvious benefits.
4339400	4343400	It's so amazing, the idea of a religion that actually deals with your neighbor,
4343400	4347400	which it should, the idea that you and the people that live nearest you...
4347400	4352400	You could say that or you could say it's just piggybacking on our natural proclivity to do that.
4352400	4353400	What do you mean?
4353400	4355400	Well, we're very social creatures, right?
4355400	4357400	Right, that's why your religion should do that.
4357400	4363400	But it's like how a hypnotist holds the watch above your eyes and then says you're getting sleepy
4363400	4368400	and you're actually just looking up and you're hearing you're getting sleepy and your eyes are kind of getting tired.
4368400	4372400	Right, but don't you think that to a certain point a magician's act,
4372400	4375400	like to a certain point if that magician is an asshole,
4375400	4379400	he might end up molesting a hooter's waitress with that power?
4379400	4384400	Or, I don't think you'd have to hypnotize him too.
4384400	4391400	Or if he's a hypnotherapist, he might use that power to make a husband and wife respect each other.
4391400	4394400	Yes, but that has nothing to do with...
4394400	4397400	I mean, I know you're not saying this, but the idea of religion...
4397400	4399400	I probably am, if I know me.
4399400	4402400	The idea of the religion saying to the magician,
4402400	4406400	and by the way, don't finger that little boy,
4406400	4412400	you know, again, I wasn't going to, but it's nice to know that I get a reward for that.
4412400	4415400	But wait, are we talking about the same thing?
4415400	4418400	I don't think so. I don't think you're talking about the same thing.
4418400	4420400	I think that...
4420400	4425400	I'm talking about Scud, the responsible assassin, now 20 years.
4425400	4432400	I'd say that as a guy raised definitely like semi-Christian, totally not Jewish,
4432400	4434400	but learning...
4434400	4438400	When I've heard about the Covenant and Judaism, when you're growing up...
4438400	4444400	I fetishize it the way I fetishize English comedy,
4444400	4448400	because I look over that fence, and what I see is community.
4448400	4452400	I see, not the show, which is awesome.
4452400	4456400	You see it everywhere. It's so interesting. I saw it on the side of a bus.
4456400	4461400	It's not centrally franchised, and I think that's the key.
4461400	4464400	It's the Saturn dealer of religions.
4464400	4468400	It's very important to not centralize.
4468400	4471400	We do it anyway, is kind of my point.
4471400	4473400	Everybody fucks up every religion somewhere.
4473400	4476400	Every house you walk into, every place.
4476400	4479400	But I'm saying, like...
4479400	4485400	Well, when the central tenet is the thing that doesn't make sense is how you know it's real.
4485400	4487400	Right?
4487400	4489400	You cannot prove this.
4489400	4492400	If you're going to try to prove this, then you don't get it.
4492400	4494400	Yeah, that's fake.
4494400	4496400	That's good, though. That's good religion, though.
4496400	4502400	Isn't that better than I demand everyone in this room realize that your eyeball was built by God?
4502400	4506400	No, because if you demanded it, people would rise up against it.
4506400	4509400	That's what I was saying, like the hypnotist.
4509400	4512400	If you give people what they're kind of doing anyway, right?
4512400	4517400	It's like, hey, you guys are here, so you must believe in Zenu, right?
4517400	4521400	It's like, well, they're here. I don't know. I'm anti.
4521400	4523400	That's so interesting.
4523400	4531400	But there's a difference between going with the flow and exploiting natural impulses.
4531400	4534400	People have a tribal impulse.
4534400	4535400	Absolutely.
4535400	4538400	That's why the Flintstones had a laugh track.
4538400	4541400	And no one went, like, what the fuck? This has occurred to them.
4541400	4543400	Why is there a level?
4543400	4545400	Because we have a tribal impulse.
4546400	4548400	If somebody shows you an image...
4548400	4550400	No, these animals have a social instinct.
4550400	4551400	No, you're absolutely right.
4551400	4555400	If somebody says to you, hey, listen to 200 people with you,
4555400	4558400	like, not 2 million, not 4 million, not 6 million,
4558400	4562400	but 200 people in the room with you laughing at something,
4562400	4565400	it comforts you and you can relate to it.
4565400	4568400	We can remember 200 people's names and stuff.
4568400	4571400	So you go to your shul.
4571400	4574400	I'm barfing up things that I learned from my Jewish friend
4574400	4576400	through his mega-Jewish phase.
4576400	4580400	But I was like, this is so much cooler than Sunday school.
4580400	4583400	That's what I miss about, like, in Islam we would go to the mosque
4583400	4586400	and it's powerful, whatever the ideas are, but there's like 200 people
4586400	4588400	and we all believe the same thing.
4588400	4591400	Right, but that's what it's convincing you of.
4591400	4596400	I mean, I would argue that what Spencer's about to take us through makes more sense.
4596400	4600400	Yeah, you know, I was just going to say that religion and devotion
4600400	4603400	is a lot like, you know, fanaticism.
4603400	4605400	It's all the same thing.
4605400	4608400	It's like when people are really into, say, like,
4608400	4612400	a very, well, high-quality graphic novel,
4612400	4617400	like about maybe a robot that murders people for a living.
4617400	4619400	Whoo!
4619400	4622400	By the way, it's Skud's 20th anniversary.
4622400	4626400	Yeah, you know, last night, Rob gave me that book not too long ago.
4626400	4628400	For your birthday.
4628400	4633400	Yeah, and I hung out with him, helping him with his AMA on Reddit.
4633400	4634400	Like a friend?
4634400	4636400	Like a real friend might do.
4636400	4640400	Like somebody, like my oldest friend? No, probably.
4640400	4642400	Would I also pick you up from the airport?
4642400	4643400	No.
4643400	4645400	I will.
4645400	4648400	So, I mean, there's that.
4648400	4650400	What was that supposed to mean?
4650400	4651400	When you're old friends, like,
4651400	4654400	Steven Spielberg doesn't pick George Lucas up from the airport
4654400	4656400	and he doesn't help him with his AMA.
4656400	4657400	That's true.
4657400	4659400	You get a Spencer for that.
4659400	4660400	Spencer's awesome.
4660400	4661400	I didn't even ask you.
4661400	4664400	Well, you said your oldest friend, you shot me a look.
4664400	4666400	I don't want anything to do with this.
4666400	4668400	I'm just going to be Jewish about this.
4668400	4670400	Super cool.
4670400	4672400	Now, go back. Go back to talking.
4672400	4676400	Somehow the religion thing was less controversial than the AMA.
4676400	4679400	I did not understand that religion discussion.
4679400	4680400	I'm sorry, you guys.
4680400	4682400	Well, we do enough because neither of us quite...
4682400	4684400	Almost talked about my comic book.
4684400	4685400	Oh, yeah.
4685400	4686400	We never got to...
4686400	4688400	Neither of us kind of formed our point.
4688400	4690400	We might have been making the same one.
4690400	4691400	We don't know.
4691400	4694400	I always feel like I clumsily stumble around this button
4694400	4698400	at Harmon Town about the value of religion.
4698400	4702400	And I'm talking to some very smart, you know,
4702400	4705400	quite possibly spectrum-oriented people
4705400	4711400	who very, very justifiably and very heroically
4711400	4719400	are very skeptical about any kind of religion in their life.
4719400	4724400	I never want to break down that wall
4724400	4726400	because that would be evangelism.
4726400	4727400	And I'm not...
4727400	4728400	I don't...
4728400	4730400	I believe that when I die it's going to go black
4730400	4733400	and I probably have no idea what's going to happen with that.
4733400	4736400	But during my life on this earth,
4736400	4738400	boy, howdy, is there a whole bunch of shit
4738400	4740400	that I can't account for and don't understand.
4740400	4741400	And I don't...
4741400	4742400	I don't...
4742400	4746400	I don't cotton to not exploring that stuff
4746400	4748400	because I think there's a higher power.
4748400	4752400	I just believe in the very lazy, natural neck pillow
4752400	4754400	of going, you know what, for now,
4754400	4758400	that stuff's called Asshole in the Sky,
4758400	4765400	who is, like, self-admittedly, in all of holy literature,
4765400	4769400	a guy who alternately comes home from work drunk
4769400	4772400	or sober and in either case might want to beat your ass
4772400	4774400	or help you out.
4774400	4776400	But I think the key is you kind of...
4776400	4778400	I mean, I'm complicit in this, too,
4778400	4780400	that you almost try not to think about it.
4780400	4785400	And it so happens that it is becoming more socially appropriate
4785400	4788400	to challenge it, which is probably the only reason I'm even doing that
4788400	4791400	because Bill Markey and Sam Harris and everybody else.
4791400	4792400	Yeah, absolutely.
4792400	4793400	So we're...
4793400	4794400	Go ahead, sorry.
4794400	4795400	That's all right, go ahead.
4795400	4796400	No, no, no.
4796400	4797400	I was never going to...
4797400	4799400	If we think that neck pillow is shrinking,
4799400	4801400	as we sort of do figure out all those things,
4801400	4804400	then we don't need a God to be like, well, God's angry.
4804400	4805400	That's why there's a hurricane.
4805400	4808400	No, we know, because the hot and the cold are...
4808400	4809400	However, hurricanes actually work.
4809400	4810400	I don't know.
4810400	4811400	I just always think...
4811400	4813400	Well, to mutilate that metaphor,
4813400	4816400	the pillow shrinks as our neck shrinks, though.
4816400	4818400	We, as a species, like...
4818400	4819400	As our neck grows.
4819400	4820400	We...
4820400	4824400	But by the time we've gotten down to .0001 seconds
4824400	4826400	after the Big Bang not knowing what's happening,
4826400	4829400	by the time we're debating about gluons versus zuons and blueons,
4829400	4832400	we also, at the same time, are developing weapons
4832400	4834400	that can destroy us in the blink of an eye.
4834400	4835400	Sure.
4835400	4836400	So we...
4836400	4838400	With one hand, we...
4838400	4839400	It's so hard to articulate.
4839400	4843400	I have to be such a more sober, intelligent, academic person.
4843400	4844400	Or more drunk, right?
4844400	4845400	I mean, it's true.
4845400	4846400	Access it.
4846400	4847400	I never want...
4847400	4852400	I don't want any smart people to ever, ever, ever drink any Kool-Aid, ever.
4852400	4857400	But I want them to allow themselves
4857400	4861400	the emotional and instinctive joy
4861400	4864400	that is to connect to the unknown.
4864400	4867400	Well, but it doesn't have to be...
4867400	4868400	You have to be stupid.
4868400	4870400	But that's not a religious...
4870400	4872400	That's not a religious phenomenon.
4872400	4874400	In fact, I would argue...
4874400	4875400	I would argue that religion...
4875400	4877400	That's not a religious phenomenon.
4877400	4881400	That actually religion tries to quiet that joyous acceptance.
4881400	4882400	Absolutely.
4882400	4884400	It will be the first person.
4884400	4887400	If you want to burn down a fucking establishment,
4887400	4889400	if you want me to talk shit about...
4889400	4890400	I mean, I guess we could do...
4890400	4891400	We could do...
4891400	4893400	There's a temple on the corner of Highland Inn.
4893400	4895400	I mean, I would...
4895400	4898400	Do you guys want to do that?
4898400	4902400	If you want somebody to take a big, steaming dump
4902400	4907400	on modern American Christianity as it is served up to us,
4907400	4908400	I'm first in line with you.
4908400	4912400	I'll do a better, more self-destructive job than anybody.
4912400	4917400	I just think the big crime is the mishmash of the...
4917400	4920400	You know, we're wearing these crosses around our necks.
4920400	4924400	The cross is because there's this dude who mythical...
4924400	4927400	Paul Bunyan or not, the story is about a guy...
4927400	4928400	It's a great story.
4928400	4931400	Who took no shit to the point where...
4931400	4933400	And who said to people, here's the thing.
4933400	4935400	All they can do is bully you to the point
4935400	4937400	where you're afraid to die.
4937400	4939400	If you stop being afraid to die,
4939400	4941400	they don't have any power over you.
4941400	4942400	He was...
4942400	4944400	I mean, the equations between that
4944400	4947400	and Martin Luther King, Jr. are not unjustified.
4947400	4949400	It was a person who...
4949400	4951400	Without question, that is a human connection.
4951400	4952400	That is human to human.
4952400	4953400	And the question is,
4953400	4956400	when Ichthyostega first crawled out of the sea,
4956400	4961400	if they could pray, would the cross have two horizontal bars
4961400	4964400	because their god was a giant Ichthyostega?
4964400	4965400	And this symbol doesn't matter.
4965400	4968400	So now you flash forward to these mega churches
4968400	4969400	where people are being told,
4969400	4972400	hey, you don't have to understand any of this.
4972400	4975400	All you have to do is accept Christ as your savior.
4975400	4977400	That's not religion.
4977400	4980400	I will be the first to agree with Bill Martin.
4980400	4983400	I think it's very interesting that you said that
4983400	4985400	taking the fear of death away,
4985400	4986400	which is what a lot of religion does,
4986400	4988400	there's something else after it.
4988400	4989400	Because that's our most...
4989400	4993400	All our instincts as animals are about fearing death,
4993400	4994400	staying away from death.
4994400	4995400	And in a way...
4995400	4997400	And about our anxiety about causing it.
4997400	4998400	Yes, exactly.
4998400	4999400	And I think...
4999400	5001400	But that's why it's an opiate.
5001400	5003400	I think that's what religion does,
5003400	5004400	is remove you from that.
5004400	5005400	And Islam was always about
5005400	5008400	body and spirit are two very different things.
5008400	5009400	Spirit's good, body's bad.
5009400	5012400	And I think that's when religion can get harmful.
5012400	5013400	Well, body's bad is where it gets tricky.
5013400	5014400	Yeah, that's where it gets tricky.
5014400	5015400	It also gets tricky
5015400	5018400	because you don't just define yourself of what you are,
5018400	5021400	but by what you aren't in opposition.
5021400	5023400	A lot of the problems that we have with...
5023400	5026400	The biggest problem of religion is Islam,
5026400	5027400	well, we're right,
5027400	5028400	but also that means that they're wrong,
5028400	5030400	so we should fix that.
5030400	5031400	And that's where the problems come in.
5031400	5033400	I think also religion is good
5033400	5036400	because you don't want everyone negotiating their own morality.
5036400	5037400	It's good to...
5037400	5040400	I think everyone in this room would probably agree
5040400	5044400	that the big problem point comes when,
5044400	5049400	oh, now we believe in some kind of afterlife,
5049400	5053400	and then politicians on earth here and now
5053400	5055400	start selling you stakes in that,
5055400	5057400	even if it's just by telling you,
5057400	5059400	oh, it's cool that you're poor,
5059400	5060400	the poorer you stay,
5060400	5062400	the richer you're going to be later.
5062400	5064400	That's complete horseshit.
5064400	5065400	I don't think that...
5065400	5067400	It's this afterlife concept
5067400	5068400	that you can take it too seriously.
5068400	5069400	I think it's very harmful.
5069400	5070400	Yeah, incredibly.
5070400	5071400	Because I don't...
5071400	5073400	I mean, the idea,
5073400	5075400	the messages behind religion that I've read
5075400	5078400	have to do with how you should live your life right now.
5078400	5079400	None of them say,
5079400	5082400	curl up in a ball and hang out for 40 years
5082400	5084400	and then die by saber-toothed tiger
5084400	5087400	and then tap dance in heaven with gishmagash.
5087400	5090400	Yeah, but they're not ever about being good for being good's sake.
5090400	5093400	It's all about the reward or the punishment.
5093400	5094400	Well, that's the...
5094400	5096400	Well, they say a lot of stuff,
5096400	5098400	but the people that play it up for profit,
5098400	5102400	those are the people that fuck things up for the nice people.
5102400	5103400	But it's not even just...
5103400	5106400	And ironically, they won't go to hell.
5106400	5107400	Because there is.
5107400	5108400	Because there isn't.
5108400	5109400	Probably.
5109400	5111400	Because that would be a silly waste of spiritual resources.
5111400	5112400	Because it would be crazy.
5112400	5113400	I mean, really honestly,
5113400	5116400	would it just be loaded with bad animals too?
5116400	5117400	Or is it just people?
5117400	5118400	We had...
5118400	5119400	Where do the bunnies go?
5119400	5120400	We had a very...
5120400	5122400	In Islam, it's very specific.
5122400	5124400	It's like a hell raiser kind of hell.
5124400	5125400	If you listen to music,
5125400	5126400	when I was a little kid we were told
5126400	5129400	that they would pour molten lead in your ears in hell.
5129400	5131400	And I remember listening to Michael Jackson's
5131400	5132400	Smooth Criminal and being like,
5132400	5135400	I'm in trouble because this song is so good.
5136400	5139400	There's got to be a point though
5139400	5140400	where you'd be like, oh, molten lead.
5140400	5141400	I don't care.
5141400	5142400	Because that's the other thing about hell.
5142400	5143400	No.
5143400	5144400	When you were like eight,
5144400	5147400	all that matters is not getting molten lead in your ears.
5147400	5150400	The thing that scares me about the concept of hell
5150400	5152400	was one of the smartest guys I ever knew,
5152400	5155400	my high school dungeon master, Graham Cummings.
5155400	5157400	He explained, he said,
5157400	5159400	well, you know, when you die,
5159400	5161400	your last thought,
5161400	5164400	the time it takes for you to think it,
5164400	5166400	is relative.
5166400	5169400	So for you, as a dying person,
5169400	5172400	even though to other people you're already dead,
5172400	5174400	your last thought as you die,
5174400	5178400	we don't know how long you think it relative to you.
5178400	5181400	I was like, oh, so if you're walking across the street
5181400	5184400	and you're like, this donut's too salty.
5184400	5188400	The bus hits you 500 million years over there.
5188400	5190400	This donut's too salty.
5190400	5191400	This donut's too salty.
5191400	5193400	This donut's too salty.
5193400	5196400	That would be okay, but worse would be,
5196400	5199400	this bus is gonna hit me, this bus is gonna hit me.
5199400	5203400	Or more importantly, like, my girlfriend's bitch.
5203400	5205400	Any hatred that you're carrying.
5205400	5208400	Or my donut is just salty enough.
5208400	5210400	Yeah.
5210400	5212400	That's heaven, bro.
5212400	5214400	Well, anything forever.
5214400	5217400	Perfect saltiness.
5217400	5219400	Okay, I don't know anything about food.
5219400	5221400	We've already discovered.
5221400	5223400	Oh, bacon's in this.
5223400	5224400	That's your last one.
5224400	5226400	I always think as a person...
5226400	5229400	He sounds like a very wise dungeon master.
5229400	5231400	No!
5231400	5234400	I always make it my goal to make sure that that last thought
5234400	5237400	will be like, smooth as ice.
5237400	5242400	I've been outed as enough things,
5242400	5245400	and it's all out there, I'm not hanging on to anything.
5245400	5248400	I think when you die, however you die,
5248400	5251400	the last thought can be as close to nothing as possible,
5251400	5254400	so that if it lasts 50,000 years, it's just like...
5254400	5256400	It probably doesn't.
5256400	5257400	It probably doesn't.
5257400	5258400	You probably don't.
5258400	5260400	Let's play Dungeons and Dragons, yeah!
5260400	5264400	You probably don't.
5264400	5266400	You probably don't.
5266400	5268400	You probably don't.
5268400	5270400	Oh, shit.
5270400	5271400	Oh, fuck, I died.
5271400	5272400	I died.
5272400	5274400	This heroine is great.
5274400	5276400	This heroine is great.
5276400	5280400	I don't think this is a heart attack.
5280400	5281400	This is a panic attack.
5281400	5283400	Dr. Schroeder told me this is a panic attack.
5283400	5286400	Dr. Schroeder told me this is a panic attack.
5286400	5287400	Mr. Schroeder told me this is a panic attack.
5287400	5291400	No, it's the green wire.
5291400	5292400	Oh, shit.
5292400	5294400	It was probably the green wire.
5294400	5297400	Probably the green wire.
5297400	5298400	I can make fun of this.
5298400	5301400	Muslims are laid back.
5301400	5304400	That's a good one.
5304400	5309400	That kid with the very heavy vest just wants to hug me.
5309400	5312400	I love being a reservist.
5312400	5315400	What a friendly lion.
5315400	5318400	Let me talk to these guys.
5318400	5321400	I'm also waving, but...
5321400	5323400	Oh, hello.
5323400	5328400	Oh, yeah, you guys should all feel free to wave.
5328400	5329400	Where did he go?
5329400	5330400	Where did he go?
5330400	5332400	We were just trying to find him.
5333400	5334400	All right.
5334400	5336400	What's on your mind, young man?
5336400	5339400	Well, I had a couple of thoughts about the whole religion conversation.
5339400	5341400	I was hoping to chime in if I could.
5341400	5343400	I feel like we pretty much wrapped it up.
5343400	5344400	I thought we...
5344400	5347400	Let's just talk about this for another five hours.
5347400	5350400	We usually have a policy of...
5350400	5351400	You know what?
5351400	5352400	No.
5352400	5355400	Come on up here and take a microphone.
5355400	5359400	It would be pretty hypocritical of us to say...
5359400	5361400	You might as well take my microphone.
5361400	5362400	Watch out.
5362400	5363400	He has the vest.
5363400	5364400	Well, I do have a vest.
5364400	5367400	Well, I've got to say, I heard first that this was going to be a shrub episode.
5367400	5368400	My first thought was, damn it.
5368400	5371400	And then you tore him apart for half an hour, which was the best thing ever.
5375400	5379400	The fact that you had a pre-written opener is worrying us.
5379400	5382400	You told us you had thoughts about religion.
5382400	5384400	We want you to be sincere.
5384400	5387400	Yeah, it doesn't include banter.
5387400	5388400	I apologize.
5388400	5391400	No, it got me thinking because I'm an aspiring scholar of religion.
5391400	5396400	What Spencer said got me thinking because you're comparing Judaism,
5396400	5400400	which the reason for the sidewalks and for the rope attached to the house,
5400400	5404400	it's about how far you can travel on the Sabbath, what constitutes travel on the Sabbath.
5404400	5406400	That's the reason for the sidewalks.
5406400	5409400	No, the ropes that extend your house ahead.
5409400	5410400	Okay.
5410400	5411400	It's all things.
5414400	5415400	That sounds about LA.
5415400	5416400	Yeah.
5417400	5422400	The thing is, because there are 613 mitzvah rules that shout and shout nots in the Old Testament,
5422400	5429400	and those are the neck pillow, the way they experience their connection with what is beyond us.
5429400	5430400	And to them, that structure.
5430400	5433400	There's actually a really good Jew blog called Jew in the City.
5433400	5434400	Jew blog?
5434400	5436400	Yeah, Jew in the City.
5436400	5440400	It's an Orthodox Jewish blog about this lady and how they use the keys.
5440400	5442400	I bet it doesn't update on Fridays.
5443400	5446400	There's just a rope hooked up to a keyboard.
5446400	5447400	There you go.
5451400	5452400	Just waving?
5452400	5454400	No, I'm just waving.
5457400	5460400	And those structures are how they connect with God.
5460400	5464400	And then on the other end, you've got, I'm Baha'i, personally,
5464400	5467400	and we have a very, very loose, very easy-going spirituality.
5467400	5468400	And what is there?
5468400	5470400	I'm Baha'i wasted, by the way.
5471400	5473400	Well, what you said over there, you said that...
5475400	5476400	I'm not.
5476400	5477400	You said that...
5477400	5478400	More like Baha'i.
5478400	5479400	Go ahead.
5482400	5483400	Tell me.
5483400	5485400	I was just going to say that what Mr. Hurwitz over there said,
5485400	5489400	that what we're about to do with Spencer makes more sense than, you know, religion X.
5489400	5493400	A lot of friends of mine are hardcore rules lawyers, and that's how they enjoy the game.
5493400	5496400	They enjoy having an answer, a do or do not for any given situation.
5496400	5498400	Right, like a give and take with God.
5498400	5499400	Yes!
5500400	5501400	No, that's right.
5503400	5506400	Man, you really launched a Scott missile at his argument.
5506400	5507400	But it is.
5509400	5515400	Yeah, a religion with a monotheistic God, which is what, I hope I don't offend anyone by saying this,
5515400	5522400	what the Hebrews invented, what they brought into popular usage,
5522400	5528400	which is a relationship with one dude who was coming home drunk and mad.
5528400	5531400	And these are the rules you follow to not piss off drunk daddy when he comes home.
5531400	5536400	And then you go and you debate the rules and you finger your beard and go like,
5536400	5539400	well, when he said this, did he really mean that?
5539400	5541400	And it's part of the game and it's fun.
5541400	5545400	It's a covenant, if you will, with like a high power.
5545400	5547400	Yeah, a game isn't a game if it doesn't have rules.
5547400	5548400	Exactly.
5548400	5551400	And then you've got people like Moses Maimonides who figured out the whole
5551400	5553400	what constitutes travel on the Sabbath thing.
5553400	5556400	And so people figuring out how to experience that on their own
5556400	5559400	after the rules have already been laid down, which is essentially home brewing.
5559400	5563400	Like God somehow thought, you know, if they live on Detroit or maybe on, you know,
5563400	5567400	that street that's parallel to Fairfax, now that's a duplex situation.
5568400	5570400	So there's a height issue.
5570400	5574400	You can go down, you can go down, you can stay up there.
5574400	5581400	All right, so can we engage in the ancient Hebrew tradition of ejecting you from the stage?
5581400	5583400	Sure.
5583400	5584400	No, sir.
5584400	5585400	I know.
5585400	5586400	I was making it.
5586400	5587400	It wasn't a dissident.
5587400	5589400	But we got kicked out of Eden.
5589400	5590400	We got kicked out of Eden.
5590400	5591400	Exactly.
5591400	5593400	It's just an emerging trend and I won't break it.
5593400	5594400	Thank you, sir.
5594400	5595400	What was your name?
5595400	5596400	Casey.
5596400	5597400	Thank you, Casey.
5597400	5599400	Thank you, Casey.
5599400	5600400	Casey.
5600400	5602400	Very nice to meet you.
5602400	5605400	But I have some Islamic influence, right?
5605400	5609400	We're actually the Christianity to Islam's Judaism.
5609400	5610400	Yeah.
5610400	5611400	You hate us?
5611400	5612400	No.
5612400	5615400	We're the Christianity to Islam's Judaism.
5615400	5616400	I like that.
5616400	5618400	I like how messed up that is.
5618400	5621400	I have a T-shirt that says that on it.
5621400	5625400	We think of ourselves as the metal arc lemon to penny marbles.
5625400	5626400	Joe Biden.
5626400	5631400	When we get out of the 60s, the 80s are going to make the 70s look like the 90s.
5631400	5635400	We're the aftermath to the iPads.
5635400	5636400	Oh, man.
5636400	5637400	Oh, whatever.
5637400	5640400	I think the Baha'i thing was, I think that's what Ridley got into.
5640400	5641400	No, no, no.
5641400	5645400	Baha'i is not, he got into like orthodox Judaism.
5645400	5650400	Baha'i is its own religion that sort of takes influences from.
5650400	5652400	We emerged in an Islamic context.
5652400	5653400	Stop.
5653400	5654400	Islamic context.
5654400	5657400	This is going to be a funny one.
5657400	5658400	This is, I think you should.
5658400	5662400	I don't think we should yell out stop at people.
5662400	5663400	I understand.
5663400	5664400	It's fairly new, right?
5664400	5665400	I understand.
5665400	5667400	You want the show to be good and blah, blah, blah.
5667400	5668400	1840s, yeah.
5668400	5673400	I mean, it's like you roll the dice when you live your life organically.
5673400	5674400	You do a fucking show.
5674400	5675400	You bring up people.
5675400	5676400	You talk about what you talk about.
5676400	5678400	You take the good with the bad.
5678400	5679400	People wander up.
5679400	5682400	I mean, these are the facts of life.
5682400	5685400	You take the good.
5685400	5686400	You take the bad.
5686400	5689400	You take them both and then you have.
5689400	5690400	Then you have.
5690400	5692400	Baha'i religion.
5692400	5696400	You have, you have, you have some episodes that are me and a blackout drunk talking about
5696400	5697400	gender neutrality.
5697400	5701400	And if you, if you have the power to go change the channel, then you're watching Big Bang
5701400	5702400	Theory and go watch that.
5702400	5706400	I mean, it's like, this is, this is free and it's two hours long and you get what you get.
5706400	5709400	It's not free.
5709400	5711400	But it's very cheap.
5711400	5712400	I'm paying a lot.
5712400	5714400	Oh, this is, this is $10 for you guys.
5714400	5715400	Fuck you.
5715400	5716400	Yeah.
5716400	5720400	And, and, and several hours of standing on your feet in the comic book store and stuff.
5720400	5721400	Okay.
5721400	5725400	So, uh, Spencer, I'm sure you're not angry right now about, uh, the amount of time you've
5725400	5727400	been allotted for your Dungeons and Dragons.
5727400	5728400	Just disappointed.
5728400	5731400	No, I don't know.
5731400	5734400	I don't care about it.
5734400	5737400	I'm more upset on Trump's behalf to be perfectly honest.
5737400	5739400	Why do you don't do that?
5739400	5742400	Because I get to come on every day and be ignored.
5742400	5746400	So like he, he only gets this opportunity.
5746400	5750400	I just want to say I didn't read, I read a couple of issues as a kid, but you know, I
5750400	5752400	got that book from him and I read it last night.
5752400	5756400	I literally stayed up till four in the morning just reading the whole fucking thing.
5756400	5759400	It's fucking great.
5759400	5761400	Thank you.
5761400	5767400	And a lot of things that have been discussed tonight are things, are themes that the whole
5767400	5771400	novel kind of at least pokes fun at, if not explores to some level.
5771400	5772400	Very true.
5772400	5774400	We definitely get heavily into.
5774400	5776400	Yeah, definitely.
5777400	5780400	And take it apart piece by piece.
5780400	5781400	Yeah.
5781400	5784400	Let me tell you, let me take the pieces and we fucking shit on them.
5791400	5796400	So if you love Judaism or hate it, you'll love Scud the Disposable Assassin.
5796400	5799400	I feel like that's everyone in the world.
5799400	5802400	Aha, marketing.
5803400	5806400	But yeah, that was all I had.
5806400	5808400	It seemed a little kiss-assy of you.
5808400	5810400	It's a really fucking good graphic novel.
5810400	5811400	I don't know if you got it.
5811400	5812400	I know that.
5812400	5813400	I've been his friend.
5813400	5814400	I've paid my dues.
5814400	5817400	Well, you wouldn't think that from listening to this podcast.
5817400	5821400	Well, fuck, fucking A, you'd think it from listening to me for the last 20 years.
5821400	5823400	How much time have you put in with this fucking guy?
5823400	5824400	Not enough.
5824400	5826400	He's difficult to deal with.
5826400	5828400	Not enough.
5828400	5829400	No, I hear you.
5829400	5830400	I definitely do.
5830400	5833400	He will high-road you and low-road you.
5833400	5834400	Oh, I know.
5834400	5835400	You don't know.
5835400	5836400	You don't know.
5836400	5837400	You're a child.
5837400	5838400	Yeah, you're right.
5838400	5840400	Hey, what's the complete collection?
5840400	5842400	Tell them about the complete collection.
5842400	5846400	It's like you get by all the Scud in one, which you just gave it to me as a gift,
5846400	5847400	which I'm very excited about.
5847400	5848400	I'm reading it right now.
5848400	5849400	Yeah.
5849400	5850400	Yeah.
5850400	5851400	What is it called?
5851400	5852400	It's the whole book.
5852400	5853400	It's called The Whole Shebang.
5853400	5854400	It's called The Whole Shebang?
5854400	5855400	Yeah.
5855400	5856400	Scud and you can get it on Amazon.
5856400	5857400	Yes.
5857400	5858400	Are we doing an ad?
5858400	5860400	Well, I'm just saying people want to listen.
5860400	5861400	Oh, okay.
5861400	5863400	Yeah, you can get it on Amazon.
5863400	5864400	Fuck it.
5864400	5867400	Let's just do Dungeons and Dragons.
5867400	5868400	Whatever.
5868400	5870400	I mean, sure.
5870400	5872400	I need to pass out the character sheets first.
5872400	5873400	Also, what character?
5873400	5878400	If you guys saw how many texts this guy sends to my girlfriend, fiancé,
5878400	5884400	congratulating her on turning me straight.
5884400	5887400	This stuff, I could throw him under the bus.
5887400	5889400	We've been friends for 20 years.
5889400	5891400	I'm the bad guy.
5891400	5892400	He likes to...
5892400	5893400	He likes...
5893400	5894400	He knows what he's doing.
5894400	5897400	I'm not doing nothing.
5897400	5898400	That's what he's doing.
5898400	5899400	He acts like he's not doing anything.
5899400	5900400	Not doing anything.
5900400	5901400	Well, that was a very good book.
5901400	5902400	It's funny to make fun of him.
5902400	5903400	I just read it.
5903400	5904400	It's great.
5904400	5907400	It's mostly pictures, but I agree.
5907400	5909400	No, it looks great.
5909400	5910400	I'm like four pages into it.
5910400	5913400	So, Dan, you wrote this with a guy named Mandy Ann Robb.
5913400	5917400	There were three guys' different issues, or what?
5917400	5918400	Yeah.
5918400	5919400	What's the history of this?
5919400	5923400	It's written by Dan Harmon, Mandy Carter, and Rob Schrub.
5923400	5927400	Is Mandy Carter just some kind of name for the two of you combined?
5927400	5930400	He's just a guy.
5930400	5932400	A friend of ours wrote some stuff.
5932400	5933400	Didn't pull his weight.
5933400	5935400	Yeah, we wrote him.
5935400	5939400	I promise you, he doesn't listen to anything or watch Community.
5939400	5942400	He does not want to see you guys be successful.
5942400	5945400	Mandy is, you can say whatever you want about Mandy.
5945400	5946400	He stopped.
5946400	5951400	He purposely avoided anything with your name on it for a long time.
5951400	5959400	In fact, somebody in my name would come and say, Mandy, they were talking about you.
5959400	5960400	I don't want to hear it.
5960400	5963400	Good for them.
5963400	5965400	I'm happy for their success.
5965400	5966400	I don't want to hear it.
5966400	5968400	Help me fashion this noose.
5968400	5972400	Yeah.
5972400	5976400	So it'll take some time to catch them up on what's going on with D&D, right?
5976400	5979400	Because, yeah.
5979400	5980400	Yeah, it will.
5980400	5989400	I mean, I recall a very passive aggressive skeleton who...
5989400	5990400	I'll catch them up.
5990400	5991400	You know what?
5991400	5992400	Let me catch them up.
5992400	5993400	Go for it.
5993400	5999400	We're walking in the snow away from the last adventure to the next one.
5999400	6007400	And we were being led by a skeleton with orange glowing hands and I would say an inflated
6007400	6009400	sense of self-importance.
6009400	6011400	But that's my description.
6011400	6012400	So don't...
6012400	6014400	Racially common among skeletons?
6014400	6019400	Racist.
6019400	6020400	So we were walking with him.
6020400	6024400	I mean, because I wasn't a blackout drunk the previous time, I was asking for...
6024400	6027400	I just said, is this guy cool?
6027400	6028400	We said, are you cool?
6028400	6030400	And he said, yeah, I'm your friend.
6030400	6032400	And we said, how do we know you're our friend?
6032400	6036400	And he said, well, I'm not eating your face.
6036400	6039400	I took offense at that.
6039400	6042400	I felt like that was a threat.
6042400	6043400	Yeah.
6043400	6044400	Okay.
6044400	6045400	All right.
6045400	6046400	I could see that.
6046400	6047400	Yeah.
6047400	6049400	So then we exchanged words and then that's all...
6049400	6052400	At the end of it, I guess he was going to be some kind of badass.
6052400	6059400	So you took a friend and you made him our enemy.
6059400	6062400	He does this.
6062400	6064400	He does this.
6064400	6065400	He does...
6065400	6068400	Oh, you stropped the skeleton.
6068400	6072400	You know, Mozart was good at piano.
6072400	6078400	Time will tell which skill is more important.
6078400	6079400	Yes.
6079400	6082400	I took a friend and turned him into an enemy.
6082400	6084400	Jackson Pollock took a canvas and turned it into...
6084400	6085400	That's right.
6085400	6086400	A dynasty.
6086400	6087400	Yeah.
6087400	6089400	But not an enemy.
6089400	6090400	Not an enemy.
6090400	6091400	Not an enemy, though.
6091400	6094400	He did take something great and make it of lesser value.
6094400	6095400	Yeah.
6095400	6098400	You know, Hitler did that with the Jews.
6098400	6099400	Hey, you're like that...
6099400	6100400	He turned them into enemies?
6100400	6101400	Yeah.
6101400	6105400	I would argue that Jackson Pollock was risking lowering the value of a blank canvas.
6105400	6106400	No, that's true.
6106400	6107400	That's true.
6107400	6109400	I mean, all he was doing was splattering paint everywhere.
6109400	6110400	It was a pretty selfish move.
6110400	6111400	Yeah.
6111400	6112400	I didn't know.
6112400	6114400	He wasn't exercising any fucking...
6114400	6117400	He was like, I'm a baby.
6117400	6118400	Yeah.
6118400	6120400	He knew that there were people that needed that canvas.
6120400	6123400	You know, there's kids in Africa who have no blank canvas.
6123400	6128400	Who can eat that canvas?
6128400	6131400	Are there really kids in Africa?
6131400	6132400	I just...
6132400	6133400	I pictured...
6133400	6134400	Less and less.
6134400	6136400	No, they're growing up.
6136400	6137400	They're getting older.
6137400	6138400	They're becoming...
6138400	6148400	The kids in Africa who were born in 1994 are now 20... 20 years old.
6148400	6151400	Almost as old as your comic book.
6151400	6152400	Yes.
6152400	6154400	It is fucked up in Africa, man.
6154400	6157400	I mean, first of all, let's open that up to the group.
6157400	6160400	Anybody want to weigh in on how to fix Africa?
6160400	6162400	That is a continent of troubles.
6162400	6163400	Oh, my God.
6163400	6164400	Yeah.
6164400	6168400	I mean, there are parts that are really, really...
6168400	6170400	There's jewels of Africa.
6170400	6171400	Yeah.
6171400	6173400	I'm sure there's bustling metropolis.
6173400	6174400	Yeah.
6174400	6175400	Central Africa.
6175400	6176400	It's just been...
6176400	6180400	I read something yesterday that was so horrifying that I'm not even going to say it.
6180400	6181400	No.
6181400	6182400	I'm not going to say it.
6182400	6183400	Okay.
6183400	6184400	All right.
6184400	6185400	Well...
6185400	6186400	That's the one thing you're not going to say.
6186400	6190400	Tune in to Heart of the Town after hours to hear what Kumail was going to say.
6190400	6191400	Come on.
6191400	6192400	Just a website.
6192400	6193400	Really?
6193400	6194400	You don't want me to...
6194400	6195400	It's like we need dark shit.
6195400	6196400	We don't...
6196400	6197400	Just say it.
6197400	6198400	We're in the Africa segment.
6198400	6199400	Okay.
6199400	6200400	Okay.
6200400	6201400	Fucking say it.
6201400	6202400	Yeah.
6202400	6203400	I brought it up.
6203400	6204400	It's Harman Town.
6204400	6205400	Okay.
6205400	6206400	Well, I didn't...
6206400	6207400	Are you sure?
6207400	6208400	I didn't watch...
6208400	6209400	There's a guy.
6209400	6210400	There's a...
6210400	6211400	Okay.
6211400	6212400	There we go.
6212400	6213400	I forget what he calls himself, but he calls himself like Hand of God or something like
6213400	6214400	that.
6214400	6215400	Oh.
6215400	6216400	This is not the Coney thing.
6216400	6217400	And he videotapes...
6217400	6218400	All right.
6218400	6219400	Yeah.
6219400	6220400	Don't.
6220400	6221400	Nobody...
6221400	6222400	Yeah.
6222400	6223400	Nobody wants to hear it.
6223400	6224400	All right.
6224400	6225400	Google it.
6225400	6226400	Google it.
6226400	6227400	Yeah.
6227400	6228400	Why...
6228400	6229400	What were we talking about?
6229400	6230400	The...
6230400	6231400	Oh, Africa.
6231400	6232400	Africa.
6232400	6233400	Oh, yeah.
6233400	6234400	That's right.
6234400	6235400	Yeah.
6235400	6236400	You remembered it.
6236400	6237400	I mean, now.
6237400	6238400	So that's a lot like...
6238400	6239400	But I mean, they got...
6239400	6240400	Maybe they'll come up with...
6240400	6241400	They got Christian Lion too.
6241400	6242400	It's not all bad.
6242400	6243400	Yeah.
6243400	6244400	That's...
6244400	6245400	I guess there's AIDS.
6245400	6251400	Let's get out of this conversation.
6252400	6254400	I saw Dallas Buyers Club.
6254400	6256200	Mazzie McConaughey is so charming.
6256200	6257400	He's got great abs.
6257400	6259400	We should exercise and try and get abs.
6259400	6261400	Very charming.
6261400	6263400	I think we're out.
6263400	6264400	Yeah.
6264400	6265400	I forgot about...
6265400	6266400	AIDS.
6266400	6276400	In Spencer's defense, Camille's exit strategy of Dallas Buyers Club wasn't that clean.
6276400	6277400	Yeah.
6277400	6278400	Yeah.
6278400	6280400	That tunnel didn't take you through AIDS country.
6280400	6281400	Yeah.
6281400	6282400	But we're in AIDS country.
6282400	6286400	We've got to go through a little bit of AIDS country to get out of AIDS country.
6286400	6288400	There's AIDS all around us.
6288400	6290400	I just went the direction of McConaughey.
6290400	6294400	That was the least successful ride, I think Disney ever tried.
6294400	6298400	The AIDS country and the AIDS country critters and, you know, they'd sing.
6298400	6302400	They try to have the boat drivers, like, do comedy.
6302400	6303400	Yeah.
6303400	6304400	And it's just sad.
6304400	6306400	I can't tell if I'm in on the joke or...
6306400	6307400	Yeah.
6307400	6308400	Does KISS get the joke?
6309400	6311400	Does AIDS get the joke?
6311400	6313400	Hey, look out for that elephant over there.
6313400	6316400	Ooh, he's spraying AIDS on you.
6316400	6317400	Just kidding.
6317400	6320400	But that monkey will.
6320400	6323400	Hey, he doesn't work here.
6323400	6326400	And then actual AIDS.
6326400	6327400	You working for tips?
6327400	6329400	Just take me around the river.
6329400	6330400	Yeah.
6330400	6333400	Well, I mean, don't get me started on that.
6333400	6335400	What are you pointing at me and laughing?
6335400	6337400	Because you're staring at me.
6337400	6338400	You're talking.
6338400	6339400	You got a microphone.
6339400	6340400	It's called Harmontown.
6340400	6343400	I'm going to be looking at you while you're talking.
6343400	6347400	You know the look you were giving me.
6347400	6350400	Welcome to passive aggressive town.
6350400	6353400	Look at me like you want to eat my face.
6353400	6356400	Oh, he's the skeleton.
6356400	6358400	I feel like the skeleton after I'm on this.
6358400	6361400	We got four minutes.
6361400	6363400	We even pass these things out?
6363400	6364400	No.
6364400	6365400	No, we shouldn't.
6365400	6366400	I got to do extra work.
6366400	6368400	If we stretch three more minutes,
6368400	6369400	I won't have to do anything.
6369400	6370400	I think we're out of stuff, though.
6370400	6372400	Oh, OK.
6372400	6374400	I don't think it's a special Harmontown
6374400	6376400	that goes a half hour longer.
6376400	6377400	Yeah.
6377400	6378400	A DOD.
6378400	6379400	Yeah.
6379400	6382400	Fuck you.
6382400	6384400	You want to pass out the character sheets, then?
6384400	6385400	That's actually true.
6385400	6386400	It does.
6386400	6388400	It amortizes their $10.
6388400	6389400	It's less per minute now.
6389400	6393400	None of them have work on Monday.
6394400	6397400	It's not that late.
6397400	6400400	Jeff would never allow this to happen.
6400400	6401400	Yeah, right?
6401400	6402400	Sorry.
6402400	6406400	Oh, good.
6406400	6407400	So this is the day.
6407400	6408400	Would you talk, Taki?
6408400	6409400	I like that people are going to be like,
6409400	6411400	oh, an extra half hour and they're listening at home
6411400	6415400	and it's just silence as we get our character sheets.
6415400	6422400	Just use that 15 second skip button now.
6422400	6423400	Thank you.
6423400	6425400	I went on a Vision Quest on Friday.
6425400	6428400	Maybe you can fill the time with one of your horrible stories
6428400	6430400	and then we'll cut you off right before.
6430400	6431400	All right.
6431400	6432400	This guy's taping himself.
6432400	6433400	There's a man.
6433400	6434400	OK.
6434400	6435400	So you know how flammable.
6435400	6436400	OK.
6436400	6437400	I think we're out of time.
6437400	6438400	OK.
6438400	6440400	What did you mean you went on a Vision Quest?
6440400	6442400	I went on a Vision Quest.
6442400	6447400	Have you ever had a strong sense of what you should do
6447400	6449400	in your mind and you just go do it?
6449400	6450400	Right now I do.
6450400	6452400	What are you feeling?
6452400	6453400	Do it.
6453400	6455400	I found the Mighty Morphin.
6455400	6457400	Rob Shropp, ladies and gentlemen.
6457400	6458400	Thank you for joining us.
6458400	6462400	By the way, we bought those mics today
6462400	6465400	and you already shropped it up.
6465400	6467400	Did you take mushrooms or something?
6467400	6468400	No.
6468400	6470400	I just had the sense like my car was gone.
6470400	6471400	It was early morning.
6471400	6474400	I hadn't eaten or drank anything and I was like, oh, shit.
6474400	6479400	I got to go find the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers secret hideout.
6479400	6482400	I don't think you know what Vision Quest means.
6482400	6485400	I'm starting to feel these people aren't going to get their money's worth
6485400	6487400	out of this extra half hour.
6487400	6489400	You know what I mean?
6489400	6494400	So basically you needed an omelet in you or something.
6494400	6495400	I don't want to reduce it.
6495400	6496400	I just mean.
6496400	6497400	That's how it starts.
6497400	6498400	That's how it starts.
6498400	6500400	They don't need omelets and then they get ideas.
6500400	6501400	All right.
6501400	6502400	Well, they shot that crap in the desert
6502400	6504400	so you went to see a rock or something.
6504400	6505400	No.
6505400	6507400	They shot the exteriors in this building.
6507400	6509400	It's called the House of the Book.
6509400	6511400	It's a Jewish university.
6511400	6514400	Oh, thread connect.
6514400	6515400	House of the Book?
6515400	6518400	It's called the House of the Book, yeah.
6518400	6519400	It's terrific.
6519400	6520400	See?
6520400	6523400	I told you Jews were forced to work in television.
6523400	6524400	All right.
6524400	6527400	So do we have the music cue for Spencer's?
6527400	6528400	We don't have it.
6528400	6530400	Do you have anything that would be suitable?
6530400	6531400	They have it.
6531400	6532400	They do have it.
6532400	6533400	Let's play it for Spencer.
6533400	6535400	Or even if you just want to play another podcast.
6535400	6537400	Maybe go watch Citizen Kane.
6537400	6538400	That's pretty good.
6538400	6540400	Play an Adam Carolla podcast if you don't mind.
6540400	6542400	We're just going to bump this thing up
6542400	6544400	an extra 10 minutes or so.
6544400	6545400	Yeah, right.
6545400	6546400	Okay.
6546400	6549400	So I wrote this one from the perspective of Lenev.
6549400	6552400	So this is all metagame information that you don't know.
6552400	6553400	Yeah.
6553400	6557400	I am Lenev the Rebel from the city of Tormod Tor.
6557400	6561400	Lenev is the asshole skeleton that fucked up my sister.
6561400	6563400	I am captain of the Death Guard and peacekeeper
6563400	6565400	for the city of Unshackled Dead.
6565400	6567400	Our city is in peril.
6567400	6571400	344 of our most skilled craftsmen lost their lung lives today
6571400	6575400	crushed to re-death by a castle falling from the sky.
6575400	6578400	The sages sent me to investigate the disaster
6578400	6581400	and I discovered four living suspects among the wreckage.
6581400	6583400	At first their antics seemed harmless,
6583400	6585400	merely self-destructive.
6585400	6588400	But they became more neurotic as time passed.
6588400	6590400	Their leader taunted me, threatened me,
6590400	6593400	and then broke into song about eating dirt.
6593400	6597400	I was ready to leave, but then he lay down on the ground
6597400	6600400	hurling insults at me and demanding I eat his face.
6600400	6603400	With some random destructive impulses,
6603400	6607400	I had no doubt that these were the Cretans involved in the disaster,
6607400	6610400	almost certainly dooming our culture.
6610400	6613400	And then he called me Laverne.
6613400	6617400	I snapped.
6618400	6621400	It's Laverne!
6621400	6623400	He lunges at your throat.
6623400	6625400	Thank you for calling me the leader.
6625400	6629400	Yeah.
6629400	6631400	All right, fine, he lunges at my throat.
6631400	6635400	You took a friend and you made him an enemy.
6635400	6637400	That's what's happening.
6637400	6639400	Does anyone have any clarifying questions?
6639400	6640400	No.
6640400	6641400	Get those out of the way?
6641400	6643400	No, eat my throat.
6643400	6644400	See where it gets you.
6644400	6646400	All right.
6646400	6647400	Can I...
6647400	6648400	Oh, is he coming for him?
6648400	6649400	Yeah, yeah.
6649400	6651400	Can I shoot him with my lesbian eyes?
6651400	6653400	You can try.
6653400	6658400	Just because I feel bad for attacking you guys and...
6661400	6664400	It goes awry, it doesn't hit anything.
6664400	6666400	All right, so I look to Laverne and I go,
6666400	6669400	I didn't mean to hit you, I wasn't trying to.
6669400	6674400	This is occurring mid-La-nev-lunch.
6674400	6677400	He grasps you by the throat with his glowing hands
6677400	6680400	and you feel the blistering hot energy around your neck.
6680400	6682400	You take some damage.
6682400	6685400	Some damage, hold on.
6685400	6686400	Just seven damage.
6686400	6689400	Seven damage and you feel an intense heat around your throat
6689400	6692400	as he's trying to throttle the life out of you.
6692400	6693400	I go,
6693400	6699400	Argh!
6699400	6703400	It's unnerving.
6704400	6706400	I'll put it at Dan's turn out.
6706400	6707400	Sharpies turn out.
6707400	6709400	Oh, how interesting.
6709400	6711400	Level six sorcerer.
6711400	6712400	Am I?
6712400	6714400	Yeah.
6714400	6718400	Take a look at my wares.
6718400	6720400	Magic and otherwise.
6720400	6723400	Seem to have lost my spell sheet.
6723400	6726400	That ring with Sharpie spells here.
6726400	6728400	Yeah, hmm.
6728400	6731400	Okay.
6731400	6733400	You know what?
6733400	6737400	This isn't a good time to fuck around.
6737400	6741400	I think we should go shocking grasp.
6741400	6742400	Alright.
6742400	6744400	Since he's up close and personal,
6744400	6749400	I grab him and I say,
6749400	6753400	Shocking grasp.
6753400	6755400	Try that.
6755400	6757400	As he's grabbing you,
6757400	6760400	you find it very easy to touch him with your shocking grasp
6760400	6763400	and you hit him directly,
6763400	6766400	dealing some damage of some sort.
6766400	6767400	That's eleven.
6767400	6768400	Yeah, that's a lot.
6768400	6770400	Twenty-one electricity damage.
6770400	6771400	That's a lot.
6771400	6773400	Surges through his body.
6773400	6774400	He's all like,
6774400	6775400	Ah.
6775400	6776400	Yep.
6776400	6779400	Wait, but skeletons wouldn't be hurt by electricity, right?
6779400	6780400	They don't have anything...
6780400	6784400	Whose side are you on?
6784400	6787400	In the morning, whose side are you on?
6787400	6788400	I don't know.
6788400	6790400	In the evening, whose side are you on?
6790400	6792400	Wouldn't you sit down to supper bed
6792400	6795400	and make up your mind real quick?
6795400	6797400	It's a fair point, but as far as I'm aware,
6797400	6799400	skeletons only have resistance to coal.
6799400	6801400	Well, and you go down that road,
6801400	6803400	and it's like, well, how's the skeleton really grabbing him?
6803400	6804400	He has no tendons.
6804400	6805400	Yeah.
6805400	6809400	It's a can of worms.
6809400	6810400	Yeah.
6810400	6811400	Yeah.
6811400	6817400	Did we just find out that this game's dumb?
6817400	6819400	If you remove all the bones from my body,
6819400	6821400	can I go golfing in the rain?
6821400	6823400	Was that science?
6823400	6824400	No.
6824400	6826400	It's still danger.
6826400	6830400	So he's so shocked and in pain from the shock
6830400	6832400	that he actually lets go of you
6832400	6835400	and stumbles back a few feet, staggering style.
6835400	6836400	And I say,
6836400	6837400	Enough!
6837400	6844400	If you want it to be enough, it could be enough.
6844400	6850400	I can rephrase that, but basically my point is,
6850400	6853400	we don't have to do this.
6853400	6857400	N-bomb.
6857400	6860400	Um, that happens, yeah.
6860400	6866400	He has a response maybe, but it's Shrob's turn now.
6866400	6868400	Whose character did you get, Rob?
6868400	6869400	I got Aaron's character.
6869400	6871400	All right, Mulrain.
6871400	6877400	I've got Mulrain's character.
6877400	6881400	I'm going to use, uh...
6881400	6882400	Fuck, man.
6882400	6883400	What are we doing here?
6883400	6885400	What are we really doing here?
6885400	6887400	What do we know about Aaron's character?
6887400	6890400	We know she doesn't spend a lot of time shopping.
6890400	6891400	So...
6891400	6892400	Well, just don't...
6892400	6894400	I mean, I warned him.
6894400	6895400	I told him, don't...
6895400	6896400	I mean, you don't have to do it anyway.
6896400	6900400	Okay, well, first off, I take the ring off.
6900400	6912400	I put it on the floor, and I take the dog and move out.
6912400	6916400	I think my amulet will do that.
6916400	6928400	Roll to see if I get to keep the cat.
6928400	6929400	You don't.
6929400	6930400	No, you don't get the cat.
6930400	6931400	You don't get the cat.
6931400	6935400	Okay, what does the amulet of summer do?
6935400	6938400	Yeah, that will read you in magical flames.
6938400	6941400	That will set me on fire?
6941400	6945400	Yes, but it doesn't hurt, though.
6945400	6947400	Okay, all right.
6947400	6951400	Not like what they were doing in Africa.
6951400	6957400	Okay, okay, so I turn on my amulet of summer,
6957400	6960400	and then I start chasing the skeleton around.
6960400	6961400	No, no, no, no, no.
6961400	6963400	We were trying to be friends with the skeleton.
6963400	6964400	Well, he was hurting him.
6964400	6965400	No, but now...
6965400	6966400	He's a dick.
6966400	6968400	I don't know what the fuck you people are doing right now.
6968400	6970400	He's strangling him.
6970400	6972400	But I shocked him.
6972400	6975400	Okay, am I still on fire while they're yelling at me?
6975400	6976400	Yeah.
6976400	6977400	Try and talk...
6977400	6979400	Stop yelling at me.
6979400	6980400	I'm on fire now.
6980400	6981400	What do you want me to do?
6981400	6983400	Try and talk to him while you're on fire.
6983400	6984400	Okay, wait.
6984400	6986400	Hey, hey, listen to me for a second.
6986400	6990400	Listen to me for a second.
6990400	6993400	Listen to me for a second.
6993400	6994400	Can you hear...
6994400	6997400	Listen.
6997400	7001400	He's a dick sometimes, but we'll be nice to you
7001400	7005400	if you settle down a bit, okay?
7005400	7006400	Just relax.
7006400	7007400	That must have been really hard for you.
7007400	7008400	Thank you.
7008400	7009400	Just don't listen to him.
7009400	7015400	Just shut the fuck up for two seconds.
7015400	7017400	So you say those things.
7017400	7021400	He's not really responding, so...
7021400	7026400	Word for word, what happened was Sarah Silverman.
7026400	7027400	You didn't say anything?
7027400	7028400	You didn't respond?
7028400	7029400	No, it's not his...
7029400	7034400	I grab his arm and I shake it.
7034400	7035400	Of course, you're on fire.
7035400	7036400	Yeah.
7036400	7037400	I know.
7037400	7038400	Listen.
7038400	7041400	Yeah, you grab his arm and...
7041400	7042400	And I shake it.
7042400	7044400	And it burns his bones.
7044400	7046400	Burning your bones now, huh?
7046400	7048400	Now settle down.
7048400	7051400	You need to settle down now.
7051400	7055400	Knock it off.
7055400	7060400	Quit barking at the cars every time they drive by the house.
7060400	7062400	It's not having the intended effect.
7062400	7063400	Ridiculous.
7063400	7065400	You're acting ridiculous.
7065400	7066400	Look at yourself.
7066400	7068400	You look stupid.
7068400	7069400	It's not working.
7069400	7071400	You look like Matthew McConaughey.
7071400	7073400	Should I get more on fire?
7073400	7074400	Maybe if I was more on...
7074400	7078400	I don't think the issue is that you're not enough on fire.
7078400	7080400	Because I'm completely on fire.
7080400	7082400	You're all the way on fire.
7082400	7087400	Is there anything burn flammable else other than myself?
7087400	7089400	No, you're as on fire as you can get.
7089400	7090400	It's pretty much a binary way.
7090400	7092400	Well, we should cook something.
7092400	7095400	I mean, you know, we don't know when we're going to eat again.
7095400	7097400	I've got his one arm.
7097400	7102400	If you give me like a bucket with some water in it, I'll hold that and we'll make some soup or something.
7103400	7106400	I'm going to try to make him pee himself.
7106400	7109400	How do you do that?
7109400	7111400	Yeah, I'll put it in the oven.
7111400	7112400	Settle down.
7112400	7114400	You need to settle down, skeleton.
7114400	7116400	Skeleton, you need to settle down.
7116400	7118400	Christoper's turn.
7118400	7120400	Oh, top that?
7123400	7125400	I don't think I can.
7125400	7126400	So what's happening?
7126400	7127400	Is he attacking him?
7127400	7130400	He's getting grabbed on his arm right now.
7131400	7133400	That guy is the nervous.
7133400	7134400	Yeah.
7134400	7135400	All right.
7135400	7139400	What I do is, and I'm still not myself, right?
7139400	7140400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7140400	7141400	That's correct.
7141400	7147400	I fucking throw up on him.
7147400	7152400	And I say, believe me.
7152400	7154400	You throw up on him, but he's not.
7154400	7157400	He doesn't seem too bothered for whatever reason.
7157400	7159400	Wow, we're trying everything.
7159400	7161400	Everything in the book.
7161400	7163400	He's not listening.
7163400	7165400	We've tried fire.
7165400	7166400	We've tried...
7166400	7168400	You shot him with your fingers.
7168400	7171400	He seemed like all the things that bones would be.
7171400	7173400	Especially sensitive.
7173400	7175400	And he's just looking at us.
7175400	7177400	Well, I don't know why he's not bothered by it,
7177400	7181400	because my thing is acidic and acid hurts bones.
7181400	7182400	Wait a minute.
7182400	7184400	What if he's already dead?
7187400	7189400	He is a skeleton.
7189400	7190400	Are you already dead?
7190400	7193400	Are you already dead and you're making us look ridiculous?
7193400	7195400	Don't waste a turn asking of that.
7195400	7197400	The answer won't help us in battle.
7197400	7198400	Yeah.
7198400	7199400	Let's just assume...
7199400	7202400	We would not have been in battle if it wasn't for...
7202400	7204400	You know what?
7204400	7207400	Let's not bring up old shit.
7207400	7208400	So I put it in...
7208400	7210400	Are you playing Mitch?
7210400	7211400	Do you know what's happening?
7211400	7216400	I've never felt more in my life like I'm in a dream
7216400	7218400	than when this happens.
7218400	7220400	Even actual dreams?
7220400	7222400	Where it's just like...
7222400	7225400	We're talking about this thing I don't understand
7225400	7228400	and I'm trying to contribute.
7228400	7231400	I wake up and think, why were you trying to contribute?
7231400	7233400	You should have just been quiet.
7233400	7235400	By the way, I make something clear to you.
7235400	7237400	Whatever you do with your turn,
7237400	7239400	the next turn is this asshole skeleton's turn.
7239400	7240400	Okay, okay.
7240400	7241400	He's probably going to kill me.
7241400	7242400	So my character...
7242400	7244400	You have to do something effective.
7244400	7245400	I'm Mandy Carter.
7245400	7246400	No.
7246400	7247400	No.
7247400	7248400	You're a fighter.
7248400	7250400	And I'm consumed with resentment.
7250400	7251400	No.
7251400	7252400	I'm pork.
7252400	7255400	And...
7255400	7256400	This is...
7256400	7259400	You're going to have to take all that out, right?
7259400	7260400	He doesn't listen.
7260400	7261400	That's a change point.
7261400	7262400	Probably not.
7262400	7264400	I promise you, he doesn't listen.
7264400	7266400	And now he's not going to watch Arrested.
7266400	7271400	I mean, we're losing him on a couple of fronts.
7271400	7274400	So now just give me this tiny little piece of information.
7274400	7275400	Sure.
7275400	7276400	What are we trying to do?
7276400	7277400	Are we trying to...
7277400	7279400	Do we want him on our fighting team?
7279400	7282400	Well, he was on our fighting team, and then one of us...
7282400	7283400	Right.
7283400	7284400	I pissed him off.
7284400	7286400	So we're kind of trying to win him back,
7286400	7288400	and now he's just left-handed because...
7288400	7289400	We're going to kill him.
7289400	7291400	We're going to killer subdue.
7291400	7292400	Immolated and...
7292400	7293400	Yeah.
7293400	7294400	Killer subdue?
7294400	7295400	Really?
7295400	7296400	Yeah.
7296400	7297400	Okay.
7297400	7298400	All right.
7298400	7299400	That's an easy one.
7299400	7300400	So you're a barbarian with a big sword.
7300400	7301400	I'm looking at my stuff.
7301400	7302400	You have a big sword, yeah.
7302400	7303400	Do you have an ambulance of summer?
7303400	7304400	Look, rage powers.
7304400	7305400	Oh, yeah.
7305400	7306400	And the sword catches...
7306400	7307400	Am I going to somebody?
7307400	7308400	The sword catches fire.
7308400	7309400	Rage powers, yeah.
7309400	7310400	Monty.
7310400	7311400	Sword catches fire, right?
7311400	7312400	Slow light vision.
7312400	7313400	Yeah, yeah.
7313400	7314400	Your sword catches fire.
7314400	7315400	Flaming sword.
7315400	7316400	Okay, so I got...
7316400	7319400	Yeah, so I've got a flaming sword,
7319400	7322400	which is also the name of my nightclub.
7322400	7325400	Flaming sword?
7325400	7326400	Flaming sword, yeah.
7326400	7327400	Yeah, I've been there.
7327400	7328400	Yeah.
7328400	7329400	Long line.
7329400	7331400	That's what we do.
7331400	7333400	We line them up.
7333400	7337400	But anyway, I'm going to use my flaming sword,
7337400	7340400	and I'm going to go right down the middle.
7340400	7341400	Right down the middle.
7341400	7342400	Then you close.
7342400	7343400	I'm going to bisect him.
7343400	7344400	No, no, no.
7344400	7345400	He won't get you.
7345400	7346400	He's going to become a bisexual
7346400	7350400	as I turn him into rubble.
7350400	7353400	Swinging your mighty sword aloft,
7353400	7358400	it glows with a bright flame.
7358400	7360400	You cleave right into his shoulder,
7360400	7363400	and you slice straight through his arm,
7363400	7365400	the one that Rob's holding, as it happens.
7365400	7366400	Oh, that sucks.
7366400	7370400	That one was already incapacitated.
7370400	7371400	The arm comes right off,
7371400	7373400	and he takes some damage of some sort.
7373400	7374400	Hold up.
7374400	7376400	Yeah, he lost his arm.
7376400	7378400	Well, 10 damage.
7378400	7382400	He takes 10 damage as his arm falls clean off his face.
7382400	7384400	That's not where arms are attached.
7384400	7385400	Wait, so you just got to...
7385400	7386400	He might have been put together wrong,
7386400	7387400	come to think of it.
7387400	7389400	Yeah, he has an arm on his face?
7389400	7390400	No, no.
7390400	7391400	My mistake.
7391400	7392400	And maybe I scream like,
7392400	7394400	go back to elementary school science class
7394400	7396400	and dangle in front of those kids.
7396400	7399400	And then I...
7399400	7400400	He takes it to heart.
7400400	7402400	He's insulted.
7402400	7404400	So he looks at his stump,
7404400	7406400	and he's like, oh, shit.
7406400	7407400	That's it.
7407400	7409400	Kid gloves are coming off clearly.
7409400	7410400	But they don't have to.
7410400	7412400	Well, he would have nothing to put them on.
7412400	7414400	Yeah, you could be our friend.
7414400	7415400	You're jumped in now.
7415400	7418400	You've got one kid glove left.
7418400	7419400	This is how...
7419400	7421400	We all did this to each other.
7421400	7422400	That's why we're friends.
7422400	7423400	Yeah.
7423400	7425400	We make some mistakes together.
7425400	7427400	We're the two seven boys.
7427400	7430400	You're not convincing him, unfortunately.
7430400	7434400	He's seen through the deception in your eyes.
7434400	7437400	I feel like if we hadn't talked about religion so much,
7437400	7440400	he would be a lot friendlier, am I right?
7440400	7442400	Yeah, I think we alienated him.
7442400	7444400	I don't get it.
7445400	7449400	Anyway, yeah, he said that thing that he said.
7449400	7452400	And then you hear the intense sound
7452400	7454400	of snapping and cracking bones.
7454400	7456400	And you see two more bony arms
7456400	7458400	just kind of burst forth out of his back.
7458400	7459400	And now he has three arms.
7459400	7462400	And he's like, I ain't got one arm no more.
7462400	7464400	See?
7464400	7467400	The two arms in the back are useless.
7467400	7468400	Yeah.
7468400	7469400	If you're having a baby,
7469400	7472400	and you see a baby that has two arms on its back,
7472400	7473400	you throw it back.
7473400	7474400	Yeah.
7474400	7475400	You throw it back.
7475400	7476400	Yeah.
7476400	7477400	You throw it back.
7477400	7478400	You say, do over.
7478400	7480400	Yeah.
7480400	7481400	So he does that.
7481400	7482400	And then he's like,
7482400	7485400	I didn't get to be the captain of the death guard
7485400	7486400	by getting my arm chopped off
7486400	7488400	and then just listening to people
7488400	7492400	and insulting me while I'm just describing the situation.
7492400	7496400	I got it by casting haste.
7496400	7498400	And then he kind of disappears.
7498400	7500400	You don't see where he's gone.
7500400	7501400	Whoo!
7501400	7502400	Thank God.
7502400	7503400	Well, that's over.
7503400	7504400	Thank God that's over.
7504400	7505400	We won again.
7505400	7506400	Probably the last we'll see of him.
7506400	7507400	All right.
7507400	7508400	Oh.
7508400	7509400	Goodness.
7509400	7510400	Good.
7510400	7511400	All right.
7511400	7512400	Well, good work, guys.
7512400	7513400	Yeah.
7513400	7514400	We should probably give each other medals.
7514400	7515400	I think we all said some things we regret.
7515400	7516400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7516400	7517400	He didn't seem to mind.
7517400	7518400	Mine's well that ends well.
7518400	7519400	Yeah.
7519400	7520400	Kind of like him.
7520400	7521400	I kind of look for him.
7521400	7524400	Before reappearing behind Sharpie Butz a lot.
7524400	7525400	What?
7525400	7526400	Hey, look who's here.
7526400	7528400	His three glowing hands,
7528400	7529400	these change their glowiness.
7529400	7532400	They stop glowing orange and they start glowing blue.
7532400	7535400	They kind of flicker with a bluish flame,
7535400	7539400	and he stabs them at you like daggers.
7539400	7540400	You dodge one of them,
7540400	7543400	but two of them plunge into your body,
7543400	7546400	and you feel just really cold inside,
7546400	7549400	like a cold winter's day.
7549400	7553400	Not here, though, in LA, like a cold place.
7553400	7554400	But inside of him?
7554400	7555400	Yeah.
7555400	7557400	You take one negative level.
7557400	7567400	Well, the joke's on you because Dan already feels all cold inside anyway.
7567400	7569400	He's used to it.
7569400	7574400	I hope you had fun doing that.
7574400	7575400	Oh, it's your turn, by the way.
7575400	7576400	Oh, me.
7576400	7577400	Sorry.
7577400	7578400	Me personally?
7578400	7579400	Yeah.
7579400	7585400	I'm going to fuck this motherfucker.
7586400	7587400	So for real?
7587400	7592400	I'm not kidding.
7592400	7594400	This is like this list of spells.
7594400	7599400	It was just...
7599400	7606400	Would you consider him a creature that...
7606400	7608400	Look, we're not leaving until this fight is over.
7608400	7609400	That's it.
7609400	7610400	No, we're going to fuck this guy.
7610400	7612400	Can I cause fear on him?
7612400	7614400	No, the undead are immune to fear.
7615400	7616400	Sorry.
7616400	7617400	I'm drunk.
7617400	7618400	I'm drunk.
7618400	7619400	I got it.
7619400	7620400	That's fair.
7620400	7621400	Fine call out.
7621400	7622400	Fine.
7622400	7623400	Fuck this fucking asshole.
7623400	7624400	All right.
7624400	7625400	Fuck him.
7625400	7626400	Fuck him.
7626400	7635400	Don't I have a higher level summon monster than level one?
7635400	7636400	Sure.
7636400	7637400	What do you mean sure?
7637400	7640400	I'm looking at this spell list you put together.
7640400	7643400	It's like you picked my spells that I picked.
7643400	7644400	Yeah.
7644400	7647400	Like I'm a little baby and you...
7647400	7651400	I do a lot of the behind the scenes work.
7651400	7653400	But I have other spells than this available.
7653400	7656400	Well, not since I restatted you in Pathfinder.
7656400	7658400	What's this?
7658400	7661400	Some guy yelling out yeah from the audience.
7661400	7662400	All right, look.
7662400	7664400	That's John Pathfinder.
7664400	7668400	He is cool.
7668400	7671400	All right, well, I'm just like...
7671400	7672400	God damn it.
7672400	7674400	Look, he's behind me.
7674400	7676400	He phased in behind me.
7676400	7677400	Yeah, yeah.
7677400	7680400	Can I do a fireball on his bony ass face?
7680400	7683400	Yeah, but it like explodes outwards and...
7683400	7684400	It's gonna hurt me?
7684400	7685400	Yeah, probably.
7685400	7687400	Same with lightning bolt?
7687400	7689400	No, lightning bolt you could definitely do.
7689400	7690400	Fuck fucking lightning bolt.
7690400	7693400	Do you want some help?
7693400	7697400	Lightning bolt behind me over my shoulders.
7697400	7698400	Casting your arms in a magical manner.
7698400	7701400	You channel a lightning bolt of arcane energy.
7701400	7704400	Fire it directly out of your back.
7704400	7707400	It blasts straight through his chest hole regions,
7707400	7710400	continues on into the darkness behind,
7710400	7713400	and he takes some damage probably.
7713400	7714400	Bone to meet you.
7714400	7715400	Something.
7715400	7716400	Yeah, that's good.
7716400	7718400	Placeholder, placeholder.
7718400	7719400	That's the poster.
7719400	7721400	What about I have a bone to pick with you?
7721400	7722400	Doesn't that have been good?
7722400	7724400	We'll workshop it.
7724400	7727400	First order of business, kill him.
7727400	7730400	Second order of business, be clever.
7730400	7735400	Taking 15 damage in the process.
7735400	7736400	Is it in the arm?
7736400	7738400	No, it's in the chest.
7738400	7740400	Whoo, good.
7740400	7744400	Yeah, putting it at your turn.
7744400	7748400	Well, I have something I want to throw out to the group here.
7748400	7752400	Since we're dealing with the undead,
7752400	7755400	they're... they probably...
7755400	7758400	You start off so confident.
7758400	7761400	I ran out of steam there.
7761400	7763400	Since it's undead,
7763400	7768400	don't you think healing would probably do the opposite?
7768400	7771400	Love it. Love it.
7771400	7772400	Healing.
7772400	7773400	Healing to heal.
7773400	7774400	Your medicine is poison to him.
7774400	7775400	Right, right.
7775400	7776400	Heal him.
7776400	7777400	Fix him.
7777400	7778400	And I'm still on fire.
7778400	7779400	Love, that'll show him.
7779400	7780400	And I'm still on fire, right?
7780400	7781400	Yeah.
7781400	7782400	Okay, give him some medicine.
7782400	7784400	I go, I raise my hand.
7784400	7786400	Excuse me, sir.
7786400	7789400	Is it too late to be friends?
7789400	7790400	Excuse me, sir.
7790400	7794400	You look rather shambled in your bony stature.
7794400	7795400	What?
7795400	7796400	I bet you wouldn't.
7796400	7798400	Please say what.
7798400	7801400	And I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
7801400	7806400	I hope you don't mind if I heal you.
7806400	7809400	And I do my heal spell on him.
7809400	7810400	What heal spell?
7810400	7813400	I have a heal skill of nine.
7813400	7816400	Yeah, that's like first aid and stuff.
7816400	7817400	I think it's a great idea
7817400	7819400	because also it gives him the strength to fight us more.
7819400	7821400	Everybody's laughing over each other.
7821400	7822400	I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
7822400	7823400	And then we get to...
7823400	7825400	Wait, you're healing the enemy
7825400	7827400	and you don't know what you're doing wrong?
7827400	7828400	But he's dead.
7828400	7831400	If I make him alive, he might be our friend.
7831400	7833400	I am on board with your plan.
7833400	7834400	Okay.
7834400	7837400	Everything goes by Adam's family rules.
7837400	7840400	Like, delicious soup tastes bad to him.
7840400	7841400	Right.
7841400	7844400	It's bizarro guy, so...
7844400	7849400	So, heal skill is like, you know how to handle snake bites
7849400	7851400	and you can set a bone.
7851400	7853400	Set a what?
7853400	7854400	A what?
7854400	7855400	A bone.
7855400	7856400	Set a what?
7856400	7857400	I did what?
7857400	7858400	Set a what?
7858400	7860400	You can fix a broken bone.
7860400	7861400	I do that.
7865400	7866400	I do it.
7868400	7869400	This is your game, man.
7869400	7870400	I'm just playing it.
7872400	7873400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7873400	7874400	I bet that is bone.
7874400	7876400	That pisses him off, all right?
7876400	7877400	No.
7878400	7879400	Set it away.
7879400	7880400	Which bone?
7880400	7881400	Which bone?
7882400	7884400	The one that's broken, motherfucker.
7886400	7889400	You reattach his severed arm?
7889400	7890400	No, no, no, no.
7890400	7892400	I don't get what you're doing then.
7892400	7894400	Yeah, it's a little confusing.
7894400	7895400	No, no.
7895400	7897400	I'm confused by all of it.
7897400	7898400	Stay with me here.
7898400	7899400	Stay with me here.
7899400	7900400	I like the idea.
7900400	7901400	I think this will work.
7902400	7903400	Kill him with kindness.
7903400	7904400	Wait a minute.
7905400	7906400	Yes.
7907400	7909400	So, you want to...
7909400	7911400	Put his arm back up.
7915400	7917400	He's laughing at me now.
7917400	7919400	They laughed at Columbus.
7921400	7923400	Yeah, yeah, you stick his arm.
7923400	7924400	Well, okay, actually...
7924400	7926400	They laughed at Columbus when he undiscovered America.
7926400	7927400	Yeah.
7927400	7929400	He wasn't a skeleton.
7930400	7932400	You stick his arm back on.
7934400	7936400	He flexes his fingers.
7938400	7941400	Don't feel so dead now, do you?
7944400	7946400	I don't know how to respond to that.
7947400	7948400	Good, good.
7948400	7950400	It's totally working, guys.
7950400	7951400	What's his reaction?
7951400	7952400	It doesn't matter?
7952400	7954400	Well, if you asked him that question,
7954400	7958400	like you said you did, it feels fine would be his response.
7958400	7959400	Okay.
7959400	7961400	Yeah, he's getting healthier.
7963400	7964400	Which is bad for a skeleton.
7964400	7966400	That's undead.
7967400	7968400	This is great.
7968400	7969400	He's got any band-aids?
7969400	7970400	Come on, let's do this.
7970400	7971400	Do I have any?
7971400	7972400	It's a iodine.
7972400	7973400	All right, let's heal this guy.
7973400	7974400	Do I have any?
7974400	7975400	I'm rubbing alcohol, isn't it?
7975400	7976400	Yeah.
7976400	7977400	Do I have any, like...
7977400	7978400	I have a Zyrtec.
7978400	7979400	Do I have, like, a cake I could give him?
7979400	7980400	Give him some meals for him.
7980400	7981400	I don't think so.
7981400	7983400	Let's throw him a party.
7985400	7987400	Let's really fuck him up.
7988400	7989400	Do I have...
7989400	7990400	Do I have anything?
7990400	7991400	You can have, like...
7991400	7993400	You have, like, a hunk of meat, like a hunk of meat.
7993400	7994400	Yeah, all right.
7994400	7996400	I say put the meat on the arm.
7996400	7998400	Put the meat on his arm.
7998400	7999400	Put the meat on the arm.
7999400	8000400	Aiella.
8000400	8001400	Let's make a meal.
8001400	8002400	Aiella.
8002400	8004400	E.T. bone home.
8005400	8007400	I put meat on his arm.
8009400	8011400	Yeah, nice to meet you.
8012400	8013400	Nice.
8013400	8014400	And I cook it.
8014400	8016400	And I cook it with, you know, my body.
8016400	8017400	It's still on fire.
8017400	8018400	Yeah.
8018400	8019400	Yeah.
8019400	8020400	Yeah, this is totally working.
8020400	8021400	Mitch.
8021400	8022400	Yeah.
8022400	8023400	Take it home.
8023400	8024400	Take it home.
8024400	8025400	Take it home.
8025400	8026400	Back in a flesh.
8026400	8027400	Yep.
8028400	8029400	I was wrong.
8029400	8030400	This game's fun.
8030400	8031400	This is a fun game.
8033400	8035400	I would like to find him a place to live.
8035400	8037400	Let's get him an apartment.
8038400	8039400	And...
8044400	8046400	Mixed methods.
8046400	8048400	So we're, yeah, we're gonna just...
8051400	8054400	So far it's been working up until your turn.
8054400	8057400	Get him a profile on OkCupid or something.
8058400	8059400	Hold on a second.
8061400	8063400	I have a moment of clarity.
8066400	8068400	I have a moment of clarity.
8068400	8069400	Uh-huh.
8070400	8071400	Is this right?
8072400	8075400	And I agree with Schwab.
8075400	8076400	I say, you know what?
8076400	8078400	We gotta kill this guy with kindness.
8078400	8080400	Let's bring him back to life.
8080400	8082400	Let's bring him back to life.
8082400	8084400	And hence bring him to death.
8085400	8087400	So maybe with my moment of clarity,
8087400	8090400	I convince him to be our friend.
8090400	8091400	Let's see here.
8091400	8095400	I say we got all sorts of tricks like this.
8095400	8096400	Yeah.
8096400	8099400	We've got a thing that grows your hair.
8100400	8101400	Yeah.
8101400	8102400	You're gonna...
8102400	8104400	And I know you hate the way you look.
8104400	8106400	I mean, why would you not?
8106400	8108400	But no, don't go there.
8108400	8111400	But I think we could really do a number on you.
8111400	8115400	Let's do the pretty skeleton, you know, and take it down.
8115400	8116400	Makeover.
8116400	8117400	Let's do a makeover.
8117400	8118400	Let's do a whole makeover.
8118400	8119400	The moment of clarity.
8119400	8121400	We chopped his arm off, reattached it,
8121400	8123400	stuck a piece of meat on it.
8123400	8125400	So if we can do that...
8125400	8127400	Now we're telling him we can regrow his hair.
8127400	8128400	Yeah.
8129400	8135400	So, yeah, you say those things with your silver tongue.
8135400	8139400	And, you know, it starts to sink in a little bit.
8139400	8140400	Nice.
8140400	8141400	Nice.
8141400	8142400	He's like...
8142400	8143400	Nice.
8145400	8147400	He's like, you know what?
8147400	8149400	Some longer hair might be nice.
8149400	8150400	Yeah.
8151400	8152400	How does that happen?
8152400	8154400	How do we make that happen?
8154400	8155400	Well...
8155400	8157400	Mulrain has a craft...
8157400	8161400	We want to speak to you about the Baha'i faith and...
8161400	8162400	True.
8162400	8163400	It's faith.
8163400	8164400	Yeah.
8164400	8165400	It's really faith.
8165400	8167400	Say Baha'i through Baha'i.
8167400	8168400	Well, we could...
8168400	8169400	I mean, do we have...
8169400	8171400	I mean, we have no propitio or anything.
8171400	8173400	You know, the...
8173400	8175400	I have craft supplies.
8175400	8176400	Right.
8176400	8178400	Can you make a wig out of them?
8178400	8180400	I could probably make a wig.
8180400	8181400	Let me look in here.
8181400	8182400	Let me look at my supplies.
8182400	8183400	I have a ribbon dagger.
8183400	8185400	You can have the ribbon from that.
8185400	8187400	Can you make a bow for the hair?
8187400	8188400	I swear to God.
8188400	8189400	You're losing them.
8189400	8190400	That's not what you promised.
8190400	8191400	You're losing them.
8191400	8192400	What? No, no, no.
8192400	8193400	It's not working.
8193400	8194400	Okay, okay, okay.
8194400	8195400	We'll lose the ribbon.
8195400	8196400	We'll lose the ribbon.
8196400	8197400	The ribbon's gone.
8197400	8198400	Sorry about the ribbon.
8198400	8199400	The ribbon's gone.
8199400	8200400	Hey, you like the...
8200400	8201400	You like the meat on your arm?
8201400	8203400	You like the meat?
8203400	8204400	You like the reset phone?
8204400	8205400	I hate to say.
8205400	8206400	I've got a nutsack.
8206400	8207400	I swear to God.
8207400	8210400	You've probably made 100 jokes about this, but nutsack is right there in my gear.
8210400	8211400	You don't have a nutsack.
8212400	8213400	And it just goes right...
8213400	8214400	That's gonna be hanging out anyway.
8214400	8215400	It's just like we have.
8215400	8216400	It goes right...
8216400	8217400	Right.
8217400	8218400	It just staples right in there.
8218400	8219400	Right, right, right.
8219400	8224400	Okay, so out of the craft supplies, I've got like some...
8224400	8230400	I took some construction paper and I've, you know, like done some streams and stuff.
8230400	8233400	So where do we land on the bow?
8233400	8234400	No?
8234400	8235400	No bows?
8235400	8236400	No.
8236400	8237400	No bow.

8253400	8254400	Don't get too close.
