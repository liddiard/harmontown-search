0	15920	Okay, now the key is with shingles is that it's not to exert myself.
15920	24720	Hi folks, I have a herpes virus called shingles.
24720	28620	You can Google it or I'll tell you a lot about it tonight, I've learned a lot about it.
28620	31180	It rides on the nervous system.
31180	34660	It's a reactivation of the chicken pox from when you were a kid.
34660	42460	It comes as a result of you either being 60, living in a third world country or having
42460	48140	my lifestyle, which apparently is high stress or low health.
48140	51020	I'm going to go with the latter.
51020	56580	So you know, I went to New York with Dino, had a good time.
56580	64820	And I think I got the shingles, I think I got, I got a fever for the flavor in New
64820	65820	York.
65820	68740	And then I got the flavor of the shingles on the way back that some people call you
68740	69740	shingles.
69740	70740	Dick.
70740	71740	Yeah.
71740	72740	Sorry.
72740	77900	Is that my comedy, my comedy car alarm went off outside.
77900	78900	All right.
78900	82580	Well, it's stuff like that that I'd like to keep car alarm 2018.
82580	85260	I want you to check that right.
85260	89340	I want to thank the production crew because, well, first of all, I want to say to the subscribers.
89340	91060	Rob, is that your car?
91060	92300	I hope so.
92300	94300	I mean, it's me.
94300	96900	This isn't helping.
96900	100980	Here's some of the things that shingles loves car alarm.
100980	102540	The doctor told me not to do.
102540	103900	Listen to car alarm.
103900	106420	Work out, go to therapy.
106420	107420	Don't go to therapy.
107420	111300	I didn't do the weekend Dracula show, the super tight finale.
111300	115340	These are fun things for me, but, you know, I'm taking it easy.
115340	120940	I have to not like even good stress is bad stress because this is a nerve, is a virus
120940	123060	that lives in your nerve endings.
123060	124860	So I'm trying to take it very easy.
124860	131140	So we did a little soft open, a little soft, warm open for those of you who are listening
131140	132460	for free.
132460	134220	That's cool.
134220	135220	That doesn't make me.
135220	140260	But what you don't know is that Dan is laying in a kind of a cool like blonde wood.
140260	142940	I'm sitting in bed with a bag of hard boiled eggs.
142940	143940	Spencer got me.
143940	147140	He's got some Minecraft flavored bedding.
147140	148940	Some egg lands, best eggs.
148940	149940	Can you open these for me?
149940	150940	I'd love to.
150940	152700	You're just eating eggs out of a bag?
152700	153700	Yeah.
153700	154700	Lysine.
154700	155700	What?
155700	161100	The herpes virus that makes up shingles doesn't like lysine, which is weird because the dinosaurs
161100	162820	of Jurassic Park love it.
162820	165020	They need it in the book anyway.
165020	168340	They kind of fucked off with that in the movie and then they didn't really talk about the
168340	169540	lysine dependency.
169540	170540	I love lysine.
170540	173820	Do you think that lysine is the reason why Velociraptor is cheetospeed?
173820	174820	Yeah.
174820	178980	So you're eating a hard boiled egg out of a plastic pouch?
178980	182820	It's full of vitamin A or something.
182820	183820	Vitamin A?
183820	184820	Yeah.
184820	187140	Can you hear the herpes screaming?
187140	188140	It's pissed.
188140	189860	It's downright ornery.
189860	192180	Anyways, now don't go...
192180	194260	Is it going to scar on your head or is that going to go away?
194260	198620	Well, you can see this one that's right in the middle of my forehead.
198620	200860	I could leave a divot.
200860	205780	It's kind of cool, I've got to say, when you get a disease that has a sci-fi twist to it,
205780	209700	I can at least get into that and get through the searing pain, which by the way has subsided.
209700	210700	I'm not in any pain.
210700	211700	Yay.
211700	215420	I mean, I was a little tingling, but I think that's because I'm on these meds every time.
215420	217620	I noticed like a half hour after I take the meds.
217620	219020	All right, slow down, Harmon.
219020	220980	Fucking stop talking a mile a minute.
220980	222180	Get your lysine, Harmon.
222180	224180	Get your lysine.
224180	229060	Get your groovy voice back on.
229060	232340	We've got some very low-energy, mild-mannered New York friends that are going to be joining
232340	233340	us in a second.
233340	234660	They're going to really keep me calm.
234660	239980	They're from the East Coast where the vibes are chill.
239980	243700	And where you get shingles with Dino apparently.
243700	244700	What was I just saying?
244700	247700	Hey, Zach, you got some music for us?
247700	249780	Lay it on us.
249780	250780	Cold open is over.
250780	253540	Oh, okay.
253540	256260	I think this open is about to heat up.
256260	259540	You know what I'm saying?
259540	260540	Where's our music, Zach?
260540	265980	Oh, so it's sort of like, you know, when you get chicken pox when you're a kid, this is
265980	274260	the cool stuff I get at least topical.
274260	282220	If we're rapping, we're rapping low and slow, beat, down those chicken pox, turn up the
282220	290500	rocks, make them like pebbles, motherfucker, face to the treble, whoa, whoa, don't fuck
290500	291500	with me.
291500	292500	Not today.
292500	298060	I need low energy, got to relax in my Minecraft bed, got to do some rhymes off the top of
298060	299060	my head.
299060	301260	I saw a snoop, loop, a dupe-a-dee-doo.
301260	304300	I fucked your mama in the laundry chute.
304300	306860	I put pajamas on the back of my neck.
306860	308420	A beautiful uptown birdbang.
308420	310220	Harman town is once again in sessions.
310220	320060	We have the supine Dan Harman eating hard-boiled eggs out of a garage station fucking bag.
320060	324540	I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis, a Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.
324540	331460	Let's give it up for your shingles-ridden mayor before he succumbs to illness and syphilitic
331460	332700	madness.
332700	333700	Your mayor is Dan Harman.
333700	334700	Thank you.
334700	336220	See, I didn't understand your energy.
336220	337860	Yeah, we didn't know what was happening.
337860	340940	We both just realized, oh, he's a slave to the poor man.
340940	342140	You're like, I mean, in a good way.
342140	343140	You're a professional.
343140	348540	You're like, guys, we haven't started to show you.
348540	354060	I was more comfortable with just a totally awkward experimental, no title sequence show.
354060	358900	You got the facial chicken pox, eaten some eggs, ate a million cocks.
358900	360740	Whoa, that's okay.
360740	366860	I don't want you to be homophobic today because we got our East Coast friends coming up in
366860	367860	the second.
367860	371780	We're going to make amends with the whole nation and my chicken pox.
371780	376180	Got the herpes virus, like bagels and locks that go together.
376180	383260	Birds of a feather, podcasting pros in the sunny weather that came out to visit.
383260	385540	Fuck your mama, like my name is Limp Bizkit.
385540	386540	All right.
386540	391180	Well, can you rap a little bit about your Minecraft pillows and mythetics?
391180	392180	Yeah.
393100	401860	It's I don't mind being told what to do because I need to keep my nervous system unexerted.
401860	406980	So all right, I'll rap about my blankets.
406980	408980	Minecraft's on them.
408980	410780	Word.
410780	411780	Oh, yeah.
411780	412780	Christ.
412780	413900	Have an adulation.
413900	414900	Have an adulation.
414900	416340	You have a slave rapper now.
416340	418460	Fucking hell, yeah.
418460	419460	All right.
419460	420460	Let's look at it.
420460	421460	I want to.
421740	422740	Are you OK over there?
422740	423900	I feel pretty good.
423900	427340	And I want Steve Levy got on this.
427340	430180	I don't know who put the, you know, the bulk of the physical work in.
430180	433580	Steve Levy made it with Nolan.
433580	437380	I'm obviously surrounded by a lot of people who care about me and I don't I don't say
437380	438380	that enough.
438380	439380	Oh, that's nice.
439380	440380	Thank you.
440380	441380	Take 11.
444380	446060	All right.
446060	447940	Have you got the chicken pox before, Jeff?
447940	450460	I did when I was like five.
450980	451980	You're good.
451980	456500	Am I going to get face aids from you?
456500	459380	It's face herpes and no.
459380	460700	Did you have chicken pox when you were a kid?
460700	461700	I did.
461700	462700	So I'm good?
462700	463700	Yeah.
463700	464700	All right.
464700	465700	Apparently you could potentially get chicken pox.
465700	466700	Well, that's the neat thing.
466700	467940	I just want to say this and then we'll bring up our guests because because our real guest
467940	469980	is the face herpes that I have.
469980	472180	So I want to introduce them too.
472180	474860	Should we bring your face herpes out and talk to them for a while?
474860	476100	Well, they've come out.
476100	477140	That's what I think is kind of neat.
477140	482260	It's like it's because it's like that's why I think we like Ridley Scott's Alien movie
482260	487500	is because, you know, it resonates that gear gear like stuff that parasitic like something's
487500	490140	bursting out of you.
490140	494820	These are when you had chicken pox when you were a kid, you know, you mostly like got
494820	496340	rid of them out of your system.
496340	500940	Like you basically killed most of them, whether you got vaccinated or or had them.
500940	502100	Same difference.
502100	511860	But they there's there's like bands of Gorilla, G U E R Gorilla, like the same virus.
511860	517180	Like it gets it hides in a certain kind of nerve cell.
517180	522940	I don't know why that nerve cell makes it possible for them to stay alive but asleep.
522940	524820	And so they just hang out.
524820	530300	And if your immune system gets low enough, basically it's like your immune system is
530300	531300	always on patrol.
531300	534620	And I imagine these things poke their head out once in a while and get beat the fuck
534620	535780	down.
535780	541340	And then so if you assume if you're I was talking to Julianne Smolinski, who I hope
541340	545060	doesn't mind saying outing her as someone who's also had this.
545060	550460	She said that a bunch of TV writers have had it like like like it's like a vitamin D deficiency
550460	553140	kind of like schlubby disease.
553140	556500	Should we get all these Starburns audio podcast together and have a shingles party?
556500	559060	We all we all expose ourselves.
559060	563300	But it's kind of neat because it's like it's a disease that you cured when you were a kid
563300	567900	that it's like the same virus hid in one type of cell, which is your nerve cell.
567900	569580	It's not like a nerve disease.
569580	573820	It's a virus that could only hide in that type of nerve cell.
573820	576860	And that's why it only ever happens on one side of your face or body.
576860	579580	That's how my doctor like figured it out right away.
579580	582660	And you can actually trace the cranial nerve path that mine are on.
582660	585620	I'm lucky because they're on my face.
585620	586620	You get them on your back.
586620	587620	You get them on your leg.
587620	589380	You don't notice them for two weeks.
589380	590380	I'll take the back.
590380	591380	Yeah.
591380	594380	But if you don't notice them, then you get those belt of blisters.
594380	595380	Oh, yeah.
595380	598420	Because I did a little research and people get a big band of it on one side of their
598420	599420	body.
599420	600420	Yeah.
600420	603340	But these these little guys, they wake up and girls.
603340	604980	You're welcome.
604980	606420	You are so shingles woke.
606420	609500	Take it back, babies.
609500	614020	They wake up in these nerve cells and they go, oh, shit, I think this guy's either 60
614020	619260	or living in Nicaragua and drinking like lead water, maybe Detroit and like like he's
619260	621060	down for the count.
621060	622980	Let's make a break for it.
622980	628620	Red Rover and and but they're they're stuck on these nerve paths and they they they go
628620	630460	straight for the surface of the skin.
630460	633500	They're like, let's cause chicken pox again.
633500	636580	So basically, like you can't give shingles to anybody.
636580	639300	You can only give shingles to yourself.
639300	648420	Shingles are a a kind of like a sequel to chicken pox that you get because your immune
648420	653860	system gets so low that the Riddler comes back to fuck with Batman, you know, like even
653860	655860	though he was like beaten in the first movie.
655860	659020	I'm not going to contract this by being in bed with you.
659020	663020	The only thing you could possibly get is if you were chicken pox free as a kid for some
663020	666820	reason, if you were like a boy in a bubble and they let you out and then so you didn't
666820	668780	have chicken pox ever.
668780	673380	And you were next to me when my head exploded with these gross blisters, which they've already
673380	675460	done and they're finished.
675460	681620	But if two days ago you had rubbed your forehead on mine, you would have gotten chicken pox.
681620	684900	I've already given you crabs just by being here for the last 10 minutes.
684900	687820	And I've gotten bored of myself.
687820	689420	Am I right, people?
689420	690420	Let's bring up.
690420	692020	Who applauded that?
692020	693020	We all did.
693020	694020	America did.
694020	695020	What's that?
695020	696020	Shrob?
696020	697020	I don't think it was.
697020	698020	No, it was Shrob.
698020	699020	Let's just believe it was.
699020	702700	Oh, by the way, Shrob, we're going to take Shrob to Boston.
702700	703700	There was a huge outcry.
703700	708060	I think about seven people retweeted him.
708060	714740	It's just too much pressure from the seven people that he pretends to be when he changes
714740	715740	accounts.
715740	718940	And I just want to say that's a really generous thing that Shrob to invite himself.
718940	719940	It's just money.
719940	720940	It's just money himself.
720940	721940	Wait, wait.
721940	724500	You're accusing Shrob of making up false accounts so he can...
724500	725500	Get a free trip?
726500	728260	No, no, no, no.
728260	729700	Let's not talk about finances right now.
729700	732820	Let's bring up our guests.
732820	740420	These two, I was just listening to their original podcast.
740420	745340	You know we're in our 300s or something like that and it makes us feel like we should quit.
745340	748900	These guys have been doing podcasting since 2005.
748900	752460	I think unless there's something about their episode codes that I'm not understanding,
752460	760500	you're in their mid 2000s on their original podcast, which is Keith and the Girl, right?
760500	764260	Let's just bring them up and we can ask them all of the questions that I don't know.
764260	767260	I kind of want to stay in bed, but because of the blanket and my wool suit, I'm roasting
767260	768260	in here.
768260	769260	It's really warm.
769260	772460	Well, you do what you want.
772460	773460	Let's bring up...
773460	776220	I want to make sure I don't fuck up their names, but let's bring up our new friends,
776220	778220	Keith Malley and Hemda Khalili.
778220	780220	All right.
780220	781220	Keith?
781220	782220	Oh, yeah.
782220	783220	Hi, Keith.
783220	784220	Hi, Hemda.
784220	787220	Jeff, can you shake his hand for me?
787220	796700	You know what's weird is it changes my behavior too, but you know you have a scab on your
796700	798460	forehead and you have...
798460	802700	I feel like I owe people, I have to tell people I have shingles because it's like...
802700	804700	Normally, you'd be in a three-piece suit.
804700	809340	Well, normally, I'd at least shake hands or hug or whatever anyone else wanted to do,
809340	813980	but it changes my behavior because I don't know what people's relationship with the word
813980	819620	shingles is, and then you meet someone and they say, I have it, and I write.
819620	822140	Our relationship is now Dan Harmon, so we'll have that.
822140	823140	Yeah.
823140	827340	Anyways, I met you guys awkwardly rolling out of an Uber with a gallon of green tea and
827340	829060	a bag of hard-boiled eggs.
829060	830220	And 25 eggs.
830220	833220	I thought it was funny how Jeff asked you, so it's not contagious.
833220	835660	Is it too bad that I'm here after the fact?
835660	838140	And then, no, I don't think so.
838140	840980	That's good enough for me.
840980	843340	That's how we try to have safe sex in 2018, right?
843340	844340	Yeah, you're true, right?
844340	845340	I'm good.
845340	846340	Okay.
846340	847340	I'm mostly made of frenet bronchar right now.
847340	851940	I don't think viruses can live in the horrible, caustic environment of my blood system.
851940	857260	I mean, the only thing that you could do is, I agree with you, nothing really that lands
857260	860140	on me can really set up shop there.
860140	863740	They'll be like, what the fuck is this Irish rock garden?
863740	868100	When you first saw it, did you think, oh, great, another blackout, or do you really
868100	869300	think it is medical?
869300	877260	I thought that, because I had a massive head, not massive, massive for a writer, a head
877260	878260	wound.
878260	888540	I had like a blackout kind of weekend at Tribeca, and so I thought that, because since I couldn't
888540	895540	remember how I had injured my head, and then I had this, I started feeling this pain going
895540	901460	down half of my face, and I was like, oh, I guess since there's no such thing as coincidences,
901460	908220	I must have passed out and smacked my head on the nightstand and maybe just slept there
908220	912180	like a cartoon drunk for an hour, or a real life drunk.
912180	914180	I love the most logical thing that could have happened.
914180	919260	Yeah, I was piecing it together, and I was like, maybe I fell down, slept on something
919260	927100	weird that the hotel staff doesn't wash as much as the pillowcases or something.
927100	931380	Then I looked close to the mirror after I got back to LA, and I was like, no, there's
931380	933980	something blooming.
933980	934980	That's good news.
934980	938540	For a split second, do you think, man, maybe I do have to quit drinking, and then you're
938540	939540	like, oh, shingles.
939540	945780	Yeah, for a while, I started thinking, oh, I got shingles on my head too, and the doctor's
945780	947460	like, no, you fell down drunk.
948180	950540	I looked at your head wound very carefully.
950540	953660	I wanted to make sure it wasn't shingles on your head.
953660	954660	It's not.
954660	955660	You're an alcoholic.
955660	956660	What's the prognosis?
956660	958100	It just drifts away after time?
958100	959700	You're taking medication for this?
959700	960700	Yeah.
960700	961700	I'm one of the lucky ones.
961700	966580	You'll never hear a shingle story this fortunate for most people, because if you don't catch
966580	970420	it in time, it can be a solid.
970420	972780	My friend Julianne had it two years ago.
972780	975700	She said it was for 19 days.
975700	983860	It's like two weeks-ish, 20 days, and if it just runs its course, which it just will,
983860	987380	for a lot of people, you get this neuralgia.
987380	988540	I think that's what it's called.
988540	994580	It's like this deep nerve pain that can last for two years because of the damage it causes
994580	995580	coming out.
995580	997580	Have you ever spoken so sexy from bed?
997580	999380	This is sexier.
999380	1000380	Why do I think that?
1000380	1005340	I'd be remiss to not ... Either of you guys want to spend some time in here, but I don't
1005340	1006340	know.
1006340	1007340	It looks more comfortable than this seat.
1007340	1008340	I'm going to give it a go.
1008340	1009340	Okay.
1009340	1010340	Come on in, Hemda.
1010340	1015300	I'm going to take off my shoes because I'm not an animal like Jeff, but we're not judging.
1015300	1016300	It's a safe space.
1016300	1017300	I am an animal.
1017300	1018300	You're right about that.
1018300	1021740	Especially in the IKEA blonde wood futon.
1021740	1025780	I'm one of those people for whom it's more rude to take my shoes off because of how gross
1025780	1026780	my feet are.
1026780	1029800	Hemda, you came in wearing what amounts to a blanket already.
1029800	1031140	You came already bedded.
1031140	1034500	Yes, I understood what this podcast was about.
1034500	1037340	You guys have been at it since 2005.
1037340	1038340	Yes.
1038340	1039340	You were podcasting before.
1039340	1041260	Maybe they even had a word for it.
1041260	1042800	Honestly, yeah.
1042800	1050540	There was still the iPod, and there wasn't a category on iTunes for it.
1050540	1051540	How do you keep doing it?
1051540	1056380	Because I was listening to your most recent episodes on the way here, and clearly, I don't
1056380	1061420	know how you started energy wise, but you seem very happy to be doing it still and very
1061420	1062420	good at it.
1062420	1064380	I do have a dream to take ... We have a dream.
1065380	1068500	We have a premium program where you hear all our shows, where you can hear everything from
1068500	1069500	13 years ago.
1069500	1073580	I want to take that first show and redo it and not tell anybody.
1073580	1077340	Just act like it's an adaptation, like a Gus Van Sant remake.
1077340	1080500	They're so polished for the first show.
1080500	1081740	You guys do sound polished, though.
1081740	1087500	You sound like you have the right amount of radio people in you.
1087500	1088500	I'll take right amount.
1088500	1089500	Thank you.
1089500	1093420	If you had insult, I think, to podcasters to say, you sound like radio people.
1093420	1094420	But I get it.
1094420	1095420	I'll take it.
1095420	1096420	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1096420	1097580	But I mean, it's like you guys are professional is what I mean.
1097580	1102620	You sound like you don't do what I do and just have people on and just talk over them.
1102620	1104340	Boo, how great is that, though?
1104340	1106460	To be able to just ... What am I wearing today?
1106460	1107700	Who gives a shit?
1107700	1108980	How fun that is.
1108980	1113220	How much do you guys plan your ... We plan probably at least three hours for
1113220	1115620	an hour show.
1115620	1118300	Always right before, or do you have a meeting in the middle of the week?
1118300	1123260	We get together three hours before the show to prep for that with our producer, Andrea,
1123260	1128540	and a couple interns sometimes, and then they prep us for the guest, and also news, and
1128540	1131580	then I have to fight with Keith about how many rape cases we have to talk about on the
1131580	1132580	show that day.
1132580	1133580	There's a lot.
1133580	1134860	He's fascinated by weird rape stories.
1134860	1137180	These are just Keith's open rape cases.
1137180	1141260	I'm like, listen, what do we think?
1141260	1144940	What's Keith's angle on those cases?
1144940	1145940	He's just floored.
1145940	1148140	I am not pleased.
1148140	1149140	That's my catchphrase.
1149140	1151860	It's his version of me, too.
1151860	1154580	I'm giving them all the attention.
1154580	1155860	Is it really more like that?
1155860	1160020	Is it like, hey, did you hear about this monster so-and-so, or is it like a true crimey kind
1160020	1161020	of thing?
1161020	1166860	I think when the story's so amazing, I have to tell it, but then it's sad news.
1166860	1169220	It's a woman got into the wrong car, the worst thing happens.
1169220	1171340	She gets into another car for help, the worst thing happens.
1171340	1172340	I'm like, I don't know.
1172340	1173900	I wish somebody told me the story.
1173900	1177380	Then he looks at me and goes, and we're a comedy podcast, and I'm like, I'm supposed
1177380	1180300	to find the funniest thing about this rape story that you just told me?
1180300	1181300	Then I say, good luck.
1181300	1183300	I say, and Honda, go.
1183300	1188300	Forgive me for not knowing what your show is, because I don't listen to a whole lot
1188300	1189300	of podcasts.
1189300	1190300	What is the-
1190300	1192580	Well, the one we should be plugging is the one that said Starburns.
1192580	1196020	Yeah, who cares about Keith and the girl?
1196020	1200180	We also started because five shows a week wasn't enough.
1200180	1204180	We started my opening line, and that's where we talked to artists and comedians about the
1204180	1206700	very first humiliating times on stage.
1206700	1207700	Okay.
1207700	1209260	Oh, so that's not the one that's been going since 2005.
1209260	1211260	The one since 2005 is Keith and the girl.
1211260	1212260	That's five days a week.
1212260	1216980	It's mostly a comedy show, but we will talk about Cosby being found guilty, this kind
1216980	1217980	of thing.
1217980	1218980	Yeah, that was fun, wasn't it?
1218980	1219980	It was fun, and-
1219980	1224220	And sad, because he's a hero when you're a kid, and then also you find out he's been
1224220	1226100	a villain since we were kids.
1226100	1231020	Right, and I was talking to a Hannibal Burst, the person that did the stand-up that got
1231020	1232020	everything started.
1232020	1234020	Yeah, and hooray for him on that one.
1234020	1235020	Hooray for him.
1235020	1239300	He doesn't like it, though, because he's afraid he's being seen as that's the person when
1239300	1243460	meanwhile he has jokes, but I'm like, okay, you're a superhero.
1243460	1245140	You'll get your jokes in there.
1245140	1246140	I don't know.
1246140	1248460	I think it would be great to have that on you.
1248460	1250980	It's not his favorite thing to be associated directly with that.
1250980	1254420	Yeah, I can imagine, but he still provided a service.
1254420	1260660	Yes, and all this teaches, too, is that yes, when you're at a comedy club, record the show.
1260660	1264380	You don't know what they're going to say, right?
1264380	1266820	If some asshole wasn't there with their phone-
1266820	1268380	Jeff can't tell if you're serious or not.
1268380	1270180	I honestly don't know if I am or not.
1270180	1272740	I just saw The Big Sick.
1272740	1274980	We wouldn't know if Kramer was racist.
1274980	1275980	Right.
1275980	1280300	I watched The Big Sick, and you know, the guys doing stand-up, and then there's a heckler
1280300	1281300	in the audience.
1281300	1283620	Well, long story short, they fall in love.
1283620	1284620	What am I learning?
1284620	1286620	Heckle, take out your phone.
1286620	1287620	Do whatever you want.
1287620	1288620	Yes.
1288660	1289660	Yes.
1289660	1290660	You don't want to know.
1290660	1291660	Do what you want.
1291660	1292660	Do what you want.
1292660	1296580	This is off topic, but you took out a light bulb in New York in your hotel and then smashed
1296580	1297580	it on the ground.
1297580	1298580	Thank you for listening.
1298580	1300900	Did you ever find out why your brain did that?
1300900	1301900	No.
1301900	1306780	Do you think maybe it was the beginning of the herpes virus, making me do things?
1306780	1307780	You think so?
1307780	1308780	You think your herpes was talking to you?
1308780	1309780	I don't know.
1309780	1313540	I want to give myself the benefit of the doubt, or rather, I should say, the reason I say
1313540	1318300	I did it on purpose is because I don't want to let myself off the hook and say, oh, I'm
1318300	1319300	slipped.
1319300	1321700	Because here's what I definitely did on purpose.
1321700	1327740	I looked at a light bulb bulb cover, and I was like, huh, and I just wanted to pull it
1327740	1328740	off.
1328740	1329740	Why?
1329740	1330740	What was fascinating about the light bulb?
1330740	1334460	I wanted to see how easy ... Does that just come right off?
1334460	1335460	It did.
1335460	1336460	It just pulled it off?
1336460	1337460	Or does it screw?
1337460	1338460	You're talking about the casing that enclosed with the bulb?
1338460	1339460	Yeah.
1339460	1343300	Like a globe of glass over the bulb to make it a little softer, and I was like, oh, it's
1343300	1347180	keeping that on, just not being pulled?
1347180	1351700	Your own curiosity is the only thing that keeps it on there.
1351700	1353300	Lack of curiosity keeps it on.
1353300	1357260	When he tells you stories, is it tempting to say, were you drinking, or do you just
1357260	1359740	have to ... No, because Dan and I live in a state of
1359740	1361460	half inebriation.
1361460	1363100	Sometimes he asks, were you sober?
1363100	1368580	If it gets confusing, if it's a story about me finding my car keys.
1368580	1374260	Our friend Greg proves severed a tendon in his thumb by doing the exact same thing.
1374260	1377140	He was in London and pulled the ... Does he have shingles too?
1377180	1379180	No, not that I'm aware of.
1379180	1380180	It might be in his back.
1380180	1381180	Yeah.
1381180	1383180	I will have to check.
1383180	1384300	A bulb went out.
1384300	1387060	He tried to pull the casing off, and the glass shattered, and ...
1387060	1388220	But the bulb went out.
1388220	1390300	That's like half a reason to do it, right?
1390300	1391300	That's a full reason.
1391300	1392300	That is a full reason.
1392300	1393300	You're right.
1393300	1394300	I did the math on it.
1394300	1396420	I still would have called somebody and said, hey, would you do this for me?
1396420	1397420	Well, I'm Polish.
1397420	1398420	I would have called two people.
1398420	1403500	We just went back to 1980.
1403500	1410300	How many Polish people does it take to ... To tell this joke in 2018?
1410300	1414940	That guy you can hear in the back is Rob Stravitz, don't worry about him.
1414940	1415940	The ...
1415940	1418940	He should just be lauf-miked over there.
1418940	1423260	There's no reason for Rob to not have a microphone on.
1423260	1427980	I wanted to think that because we all evolved from the same amoeba, basically, and then
1427980	1432700	even though we branched off, that there's some part of us that's similar to the moth
1432700	1437940	when we get that drunk, that we're just like, that that's why drunk guys do what a moth
1437940	1441420	would do if it had hands, which is just fuck with a light bulb.
1441420	1442420	Like a danto flame?
1442420	1444580	You were in a hotel room and you take it.
1444580	1445580	What's that?
1445580	1446580	You were in a hotel?
1446580	1447580	Yeah.
1447580	1448580	Yeah, there's also a lack of permanence in hotels.
1448580	1450140	Well, it's also a mystery, too.
1450140	1452740	You know how your own light fixtures work.
1452740	1453740	Do you really?
1453740	1459700	Well, when you first get a new place, you don't, and remember all the business that
1459700	1462660	you have to go through when that first light goes out in that first room, and you're like,
1462660	1463660	what the fuck?
1463660	1464660	How does this flower work?
1464660	1468540	You know, like in a hotel, it's all your first day.
1468540	1469540	Yeah.
1469540	1470540	And you're like, what the fuck?
1470540	1471540	What's this thing?
1471540	1472540	Okay.
1472540	1473540	So that makes sense.
1473540	1474540	But then you have it in your hand.
1474540	1475540	Now you want to smash it.
1475540	1476540	I don't.
1476540	1477540	I want to say I didn't like, because that seems so juvenile.
1477540	1478540	You want to say a lot of things.
1478540	1481460	But I, so I want, I mean, it's in my hand.
1481460	1486020	How do I get it out of my head?
1486020	1487300	You wanted to hear it smash.
1487300	1488820	You wanted to see how it's smashed.
1488820	1490340	You wanted to see what you can get away with.
1490340	1491340	It's a new place.
1491340	1492340	How do the floors work?
1492340	1494460	There's two things that cause me rage in hotel rooms.
1494460	1498420	I'm in a hotel a lot because I, you know, they do a lot of like travel comedy gigs.
1498420	1499420	Humblebrag.
1499420	1501420	No, that is a humblebrag.
1501420	1503580	Some people might just be in hotels sometimes.
1503580	1504580	I'm in them a lot.
1504580	1507460	The TV remotes never work.
1507460	1510120	You have to fight with the TV remotely constantly.
1510120	1512980	And then when you shut the door and you got the do not disturb, I always put the do not
1512980	1516540	disturb thing on because I don't need the housekeeping to come every five seconds.
1516540	1520980	Because if I want to come back under there, every time you shut the door, the thing flies
1520980	1521980	off.
1521980	1524700	You make it so that stays on the doorknob.
1524700	1527100	I'm glad we talk about the real issues on this show.
1527100	1528100	Yeah.
1528100	1529100	Yeah.
1529100	1530100	We're not afraid to tackle the real shit.
1530100	1531100	It's true.
1531100	1534180	I got a little nervous as you were talking, but I'm back on board now.
1534180	1535180	I can get it.
1535180	1536180	Right.
1536180	1537180	That's Captain Fantastic.
1537180	1539500	Let me tell you the greatest thing I can do with my stretchy arms.
1539500	1544260	I can put on the do not disturb sign and slink right back in as it closes.
1544260	1545260	Yeah.
1545260	1546260	No, I'm not talking about that.
1546260	1550300	It usually stays on when it goes back because like there's like the air sucks it back in.
1550300	1553940	It's when you leave and you open the door and when it shuts, it wants to like something
1553940	1555740	about leaving.
1555740	1559320	They can come up with something better in the brainstorming sessions that they spend
1559320	1562940	trying to come up with new ways of saying do not disturb.
1562940	1565060	Like I'm a lotus.
1565060	1566060	Let me bloom.
1566060	1567500	What the fuck are you talking about?
1567500	1571220	It's like trying to figure out which is the men's room in a fucking art gallery.
1571220	1573700	What do you mean Picasso's?
1573700	1575020	What is that?
1575020	1576700	I'm shingling in here.
1577700	1581940	I just pictured you looking for the bathroom.
1581940	1582940	You're like fuck it.
1582940	1585180	You take your dick out and people start pointing.
1585180	1586180	I don't know why.
1586180	1587180	I'm sorry.
1587180	1588180	Maybe it's the shingles.
1588180	1591420	What is the origin story of your friendship between you and Keith and him?
1591420	1592420	We don't talk about it.
1592420	1593420	Yeah, we don't.
1593420	1595660	But it's working out and that's what matters.
1595660	1596660	Are you friends?
1596660	1597660	Yeah, we are friends.
1597660	1598660	I'd say we're friends.
1598660	1599660	Yes.
1599660	1600660	I mean, how long have you known each other?
1600660	1601660	What's your backstory?
1601660	1605260	I think we've known each other for like 15 years now.
1605260	1606420	We met at an open mic.
1606460	1611500	It was a weird open mic where you got to do literally anything for eight minutes.
1611500	1616300	So we've watched someone drink their own urine or you know.
1616300	1617300	Joy.
1617300	1620300	That is the weirdest.
1620300	1624500	That's now everyone's going to wonder for the rest of their lives if this was the worst
1624500	1625500	written sketch.
1625500	1627940	That's what pee looks like when you have shingles.
1627940	1628940	Yeah.
1628940	1629940	Yeah.
1629940	1630940	Wait till you go for the eggs.
1630940	1634100	A jug of what he's choosing to call green tea.
1634100	1635100	It says green tea.
1635580	1637580	Well, it might be green pee.
1637580	1638580	Oh, OK.
1638580	1639580	Sorry.
1639580	1640580	That's how you met.
1640580	1643820	But it's weird that I pulled up a container of urine looking.
1643820	1644820	Yeah.
1644820	1645820	So, yeah.
1645820	1646820	Oh, yeah.
1646820	1648380	One time we saw someone at that open mic.
1648380	1650140	Dripping period blood and drawing with it.
1650140	1651140	Oh, he's good.
1651140	1652140	He's good.
1652140	1653140	That would have been.
1653140	1654140	What was that?
1654140	1655140	You trying to flummox him?
1655140	1656140	Yeah.
1656140	1657140	Yeah.
1657140	1658140	Yeah.
1658140	1659140	OK.
1659140	1660140	You can't shake him.
1660140	1661140	I see that.
1661140	1662140	When Dan gets a green tea, hankering.
1662140	1663140	He's...
1663140	1664140	I'm also a terrible listener.
1664660	1667580	So somebody drank their own pee on stand and you thought, let's do a podcast.
1667580	1668580	Yeah.
1668580	1670540	Well, he was doing stand up and I was singing.
1670540	1677340	And then I was half offended by his jokes, but I loved that he was going for it.
1677340	1680140	And so I spoke to him after one of his sets.
1680140	1682580	We started dating shortly after.
1682580	1683580	And years...
1683580	1684580	Yeah, bro.
1684580	1685580	Fist pump.
1685580	1686580	Don't fist pound that.
1686580	1687580	No, no, no.
1687580	1688580	Are you still...
1688580	1689580	Fuck.
1689580	1690580	No, bro.
1690580	1691580	Fist pump.
1692020	1694020	Fist pump everything that happened.
1694020	1695020	It's cool.
1695020	1696020	It's a cool thing after another.
1696020	1701220	So she broke your heart and you decided to keep your phony baloney relationship alive
1701220	1702220	via podcast.
1702220	1703220	Yes.
1703220	1704220	Yeah, yeah.
1704220	1707340	Actually, I think we would have broken up a year before we did, but the podcast, I think,
1707340	1708340	kept us together.
1708340	1711820	And then you were like, wait, let's keep the thing that works.
1711820	1712820	Yeah.
1712820	1714940	Because I was like, oh, my God, I hate you for 23 hours.
1714940	1717340	But then for that one hour of podcasting, you're super fun.
1717340	1720260	But the math wasn't adding up, so we had to break up.
1720260	1721260	Right.
1721940	1722940	I keep wanting to ask...
1722940	1724980	I don't know how many more times I'm going to say your name, and I know you have to have
1724980	1730100	this conversation every time, but I'm just curious what is your take on that.
1730100	1734300	How much do you prefer being put behind the CH?
1734300	1736860	How do you say your own name?
1736860	1737860	Chemdah.
1737860	1740180	So you go for it.
1740180	1742380	But if I do that, I feel it's...
1742380	1743380	Say it.
1743380	1744380	Say my name.
1744380	1745380	Chemdah.
1745380	1746380	It feels like I'm doing a character.
1746380	1747380	Say it again.
1747380	1748380	Chemdah.
1748380	1749380	How does it feel now?
1749380	1750380	It felt still weird.
1750500	1751500	I'm going back to when you were five.
1751500	1752500	Chemdah.
1752500	1753500	No, dad.
1753500	1754500	Not with the buckle end.
1754500	1755500	Now say it.
1755500	1756500	Chemdah.
1756500	1757500	Chemdah.
1757500	1758500	How does it feel now?
1758500	1759500	Oh, good.
1759500	1760500	Okay.
1760500	1761500	It's like Cracker Jack and Apple Pie.
1761500	1762500	I've been saying hemdah and I'm wrong.
1762500	1763500	It's got a huck in it.
1763500	1764500	It's got a ugh.
1764500	1765500	Hemdah.
1765500	1766500	Hemdah.
1766500	1767500	Yeah.
1767500	1768500	All right.
1768500	1769500	You were born in Israel?
1769500	1770500	Israel.
1770500	1771500	Mm-hmm.
1771500	1772500	But raised in New York since you were four?
1772500	1773500	Yes.
1773500	1774500	Really?
1774500	1775500	This is why we broke up.
1775500	1776500	He's the worst listener.
1776500	1780220	And your eyes are hazel.
1781220	1784220	You have a whole singing thing going.
1784220	1785220	I did some singing, yeah.
1785220	1787220	That's all I know, is singing things.
1787220	1791220	Like you have an album in addition to...
1791220	1795220	But you've done backup on other people's stuff?
1795220	1801220	I've collaborated with people on world music and dance music and all kinds of different
1801220	1802220	things.
1802220	1804220	There's probably one of the most...
1804220	1805220	I don't know which...
1805220	1810180	It's popular in different genres, but Conjure One, which was from Delirium, which is world
1810180	1811180	music.
1811180	1812300	Some people know that in the...
1812300	1813300	With Poe and Sinead O'Connor.
1813300	1814300	Oh, yeah.
1814300	1816780	I was on an album with Poe and Sinead O'Connor.
1816780	1817780	Can you tell?
1817780	1818780	I feel weird talking about this.
1818780	1819780	It's like that...
1819780	1820780	I just...
1820780	1821780	She's an amazing singer.
1821780	1823620	You're talking to a man drinking urine and eating eggs out of a sack.
1823620	1824620	Yeah.
1824620	1826420	That's why she doesn't want to come off too pretentious.
1826420	1828420	You don't want to take it too seriously, right?
1828420	1829420	Okay.
1829420	1830420	Let's put it this way.
1830420	1833380	She's been in a lot of hotel rooms, so...
1833380	1834900	She did pretty well.
1834900	1841580	Are you guys in your partnership as far as your dynamic?
1841580	1843580	Do you think of yourself as more the...
1843580	1846740	The will-they-won't-they kind, right?
1846740	1852180	Is she bringing the...
1852180	1853180	Is there a contrast?
1853180	1860140	Are you broing down and fist bumping and she's like mother Gaia, trying to make you more
1860140	1861140	likable?
1861140	1862140	Yes.
1862140	1863140	Okay.
1863140	1864140	Yeah.
1864380	1865380	She's definitely more spiritual.
1865380	1867180	She's definitely deeper.
1867180	1868700	She thinks people...
1868700	1871020	That everybody has good qualities.
1871020	1872020	He thinks that's weird.
1872020	1876260	Do you think everybody has good qualities?
1876260	1877260	I think...
1877260	1878260	I think...
1878260	1879660	I think that nobody has good qualities.
1879660	1882180	I go through those phases, you know?
1882180	1887940	I'm not in that phase right now, but when I'm down, I don't even think anyone has any
1887940	1889580	good qualities.
1889580	1896020	But then when I'm relatively stabilized or up, I feel like everybody's the hero of their
1896020	1897020	own story.
1897020	1898700	There's no such thing as a bad person.
1898700	1901100	But you think everyone's stupid.
1901100	1905180	That's me pretty down.
1905180	1908580	When I'm up, I'm like, well, what's stupid?
1908580	1910060	What is that?
1910060	1915020	Who says that guy over there eating a brick is smarter than me or dumber than me?
1915020	1917780	Maybe he's a genius at brick eating.
1917860	1924060	I don't really feel dumber than some people about other stuff, you know?
1924060	1927860	I do see some people talking to themselves in New York, you know, just having conversations
1927860	1931140	with nobody across the street, you know, and then responding.
1931140	1933140	And I go, what if they're right?
1933140	1935940	What if they see something that we don't see?
1935940	1937460	And what if there is a person over there?
1937460	1945580	I, over time, have become like, I can relate to them because I do a lot of talking to myself
1945580	1946580	at home.
1946580	1950460	I think it's just me having fun and doing voices, but no, I'm crazy.
1950460	1955540	I sing and rap and talk while I make a sandwich or take a shower.
1955540	1959260	I'm only a paycheck away from being the guy on the street who's rapping on the street
1959260	1960260	corner for no reason.
1960260	1961260	That's why you wear a tie.
1961260	1962260	You're trying to fool everybody.
1962260	1963900	No, my suit is the only thing holding me up.
1963900	1964900	Yeah.
1964900	1968860	Yeah, because not to be glib about it, but like if they're homeless, then they're going
1968860	1973900	to do a couple of things that you do in your own home, like out on the sidewalk.
1973900	1978780	I don't think that's the real reason why someone's talking to themself on the sidewalk.
1978780	1980180	That's their singing in the shower.
1980180	1982380	I think they're mentally ill and they guys do.
1982380	1989460	I can inject myself into a person that if I were homeless and not at work, then I would
1989460	1993540	probably be a guy that was making a lot of noise out in the street, like for different
1993540	1994540	reasons maybe or maybe not.
1994540	1995540	I don't know.
1995540	1998460	Yeah, if I wasn't worried about like, oh man, I hope someone reads my screenplay and I don't
1998460	2007180	want to, you know, once I was committed to homelessness, yeah, I'd be like talking about
2007180	2008180	it a lot.
2008180	2014060	I'd be like, this is great, or this sucks, or look at me, like, what are you eating over
2014060	2015060	there?
2015060	2016060	It looks stupid.
2016060	2017060	Like a nice dog.
2017060	2018540	How do you know when you're finished?
2018540	2019540	That kind of stuff.
2019540	2020540	Like heckling.
2020540	2021540	Right.
2021540	2025300	You know who's mad about you right now is every homeless person watching you being in
2025300	2027340	a comfy bed that someone brought you because...
2027340	2029020	What about how I'd out homeless them?
2029020	2031420	I wasn't saying I'd do it better.
2031420	2032420	I saw it.
2032420	2033420	You know what?
2033420	2034420	This is the freakiest thing I ever saw.
2034420	2039820	Well, when I was like younger in Milwaukee, I was like a 20 something, like, you know,
2039820	2044220	I think about this all the time too, even when I hear people that are like, you know,
2044220	2049100	like that I get like, oh, you're so stupid, like you're fucking Nazi on Twitter or whatever.
2049100	2053100	But like, I remember being like, like, I just thought all homeless people were like bums
2053100	2057380	that didn't couldn't get it that they were like, like, oh, I don't want to get a job.
2057380	2059220	So someone give me some money.
2059220	2066860	And I remember talking to this, this friend of mine, who was a comic and she's like doing
2066860	2070540	some volunteer thing for homeless people and I made some comment and she's like, what the
2070540	2071540	fuck is that?
2071540	2072540	What are you talking about?
2072540	2073540	What do you think homeless people are?
2073540	2074540	And I'm like, I don't know.
2074540	2075860	They're like people that don't have jobs and stuff.
2075860	2078220	She's like, they're mentally ill people that don't have a support system.
2078220	2080180	Like, do you know what schizophrenia is?
2080700	2085300	It just kind of like blew my mind and like, but before that, I was still an adult and
2085300	2089100	still a smart and still thought that I was right about everything.
2089100	2092860	And it just it's not like she was an encyclopedia or showed me anything.
2092860	2098460	It was just like one person going like, you moron, like, you don't even know what these
2098460	2100300	things are because you don't even think about them.
2100540	2103700	And then when I moved to L.A., one of the first things I saw that freaked me out because
2103700	2106820	in Milwaukee, all the homeless people die off like once a year.
2106820	2109740	They break into everyone's cars and just die while they're trying to get warm.
2110140	2111860	And like mosquitoes.
2113700	2119460	But then I was like on the third steep promenade and there was this guy and he looked
2119460	2121980	like he basically looked like Danny Trejo.
2121980	2127900	Like he was so like prison tatted and like scary looking like he looked like he could.
2127900	2136220	He just looked like you would cast him as like a no nonsense street lethal like gangster.
2136220	2141740	And but he was like he was just shrieking and like crying.
2141740	2144900	He was like like like he he was he was crying like a baby.
2145140	2150580	He was he was crying like like like somebody had taken his balloon and he was six years
2150580	2154180	old. I remember thinking, oh, he's probably like 22 years old.
2154180	2160820	Maybe he just started to like go, you know, like like like like some chemical
2160820	2165500	imbalance is kicking in and he doesn't have a family that's like going to, you know,
2165940	2168100	say, hey, when you pass, I support you.
2169580	2172900	Exactly. I was like, you can see everybody like what do you do?
2172900	2176860	You just you have to treat the person like a ghost, you know, because you walk up to
2176860	2178860	somebody who's like, but it's weird.
2179260	2181380	They're not always just like talking to a fire hydrant.
2181700	2183580	The person was simply emoting.
2183740	2189020	But but it's funny how how strict our standards are for what you're supposed to be doing
2189020	2190780	and feeling and how empathic we are.
2190780	2193820	We're like, oh, that guy is not supposed to be that sad about anything.
2194260	2196300	Nobody was looking around for his missing kid.
2196460	2201380	We knew he was crazy because and I did air quotes for the people listening.
2204340	2206660	Because because we just knew immediately.
2206700	2212740	But it's funny how like that amount of empathy results in just like we're like insects
2212740	2214980	too. Like we just go, oh, he's a dysfunctional ant.
2214980	2216260	So like clear path.
2216260	2219620	And anyways, you look like you're probably going to say something 20 minutes ago.
2221220	2222940	I'm just into this is so surreal.
2222940	2225620	I'm just I'm like, oh, nighttime stories with Dan Harmon.
2227220	2231220	I was going to say that I feel like a lot of people experience that in New York, like
2231220	2234780	you you're constantly around people and we don't really have cars.
2234780	2238460	We don't have a car. So we're riding in public all the time and you'll have these
2238460	2243780	breakdown moments and maybe more women than men because men's tear ducts are kind of
2243780	2247420	blocked. But fuck yeah, bro, I know our heart digs.
2247740	2252060	Yes, with your very, very super hard because giant balls that you I don't even know how
2252060	2253860	you carry those things in our tear ducts.
2253860	2259060	Yeah, maybe I see a lot of women don't know is that when we're not showing our balls,
2259060	2261580	they're right up in our tear ducts, keeping us from crying.
2262980	2264740	And when they're soft, we go to four hymns.
2264740	2270060	Oh, I thought you were playing the ad music accidentally hit my iPad with one of my balls.
2270220	2271180	Sorry, what were you saying?
2271180	2276500	So so I think every woman I know has this story where she was crying on the train and
2276500	2277820	there's like different responses.
2277820	2281860	Most of the time, another woman will pass you a napkin or a tissue from her purse.
2282060	2283820	And that's it. That's all you get.
2283820	2288780	It's like we feel you now, you know, shut that shit down by the time you get to the office.
2288900	2291940	Wow. Yeah, I get my phone number.
2292860	2294900	Yeah, like for help call.
2296620	2300900	We'll see. Should we bring up when I was like, like when I was 10 or 11, I was in New
2300940	2306500	York with my mom, we're in a subway and like double A or whatever that one is.
2306860	2313700	And there was a guy that was ranting and raving about Reaganomics and then trickle down.
2313700	2317380	And he was screaming at everybody and nobody just gave him the time of day.
2317380	2319540	Everyone's reading the newspaper, looking at their shit, doing their thing.
2320340	2325340	And he was screaming, screaming, screaming and pulled out a knife like a small knife.
2325340	2328820	Still, nobody gave him the time of day like like he's not going to do anything.
2329340	2332900	But the moment he walked up to my mom and started screaming, all the men stood up.
2334020	2338500	They all put their newspaper down like, OK, like you can bluster around me.
2338500	2341780	But like, like the moment he started doing that to a woman, they took out their knives.
2341980	2343980	Yes, we were here first.
2343980	2346340	You're never alone.
2346340	2348780	I thought that guy was going to turn out to be Alan Greenspan
2350500	2352540	because he was raving about economics.
2352820	2356060	All right. Let's and that's why I broke the light bulb.
2356060	2358180	Thank you. Yeah, that's a good story.
2358220	2359900	I think I maybe just held it.
2359900	2361060	You want you want to crawl on there?
2361060	2366180	You want to make this a way you ever get so drunk that like like like you just turn into
2366780	2368300	you're just an animal.
2368300	2369860	It's right before you pass out.
2369860	2372100	Hopefully you're off the road out of public.
2372100	2377780	But you're just like you have reduced yourself to nothing but cortex.
2378740	2382980	So I think if I did break that thing on purpose, it was because I had been.
2383060	2385100	That's what I had achieved that state.
2385100	2390100	I was like just looking at it like like I was on an alien planet
2390100	2391980	and wanted to know how gravity worked.
2391980	2393300	Like I was like, feel good.
2393300	2395060	It feels like it would feel good.
2395060	2398860	I remember I remember my emotional response to it shattering and going like,
2399180	2402780	I just stood there and then I remember going, huh?
2404180	2407860	But it was more like it wasn't about the thing because it did exactly what glass
2407860	2408900	is supposed to do when it breaks.
2408900	2413300	But I was looking at myself and going, that's what I do with my time.
2413300	2416140	Broken person.
2416140	2420140	You can just drop a human being from even even even
2421460	2426300	the height of comfort and privilege, and it'll just it'll just like it just shatters.
2426300	2430020	Like what I'm just I just I was like, I pulled myself out of like
2430020	2433420	because I have nothing to because I had nothing to be upset about.
2433420	2435180	I I did this thing.
2435180	2438300	I think that's why Rockstar is like trash hotel rooms, because it's like you just
2438540	2442060	you can't manage all of the everything's fine.
2442140	2444620	Here's another thing that would make me want to trash your hotel room is when
2444620	2448380	I've spoken about it before, when they ornamentally put the Kleenex
2448740	2452060	like in a little beautiful lotus shape, you know,
2452460	2455900	and then you take those out because those have been handled and folded into origami
2455900	2459580	by the person who presumably had been cleaning up somebody else's poop.
2461020	2463220	No offense to the housekeeping industry, which is a noble,
2464180	2466340	wonderful profession.
2466340	2468540	You take that out where the offense would have came from.
2468660	2470540	And no offense, poop handlers.
2470540	2474060	But then we take it and we take out the lotus blossom with five
2474060	2477500	or two, twelve Kleenexes, and that's all of them.
2477620	2479860	And then you fucking throw it out and you have no Kleenex
2479860	2482340	now, except the ones that have an origami into sadness.
2482420	2484500	Speaking of Kleenex, let's bring to the stage.
2485340	2487580	He's performed for clubs and colleges all over America.
2488260	2492100	Rob Shrob. Rob Shrob.
2495860	2498940	He looks just this boat well.
2501100	2503900	Have the guy out of the bed like it's like the couch at Johnny Carson,
2503900	2506300	where she had to move down to the to the panel.
2506300	2507500	I want to give everyone a chance.
2507500	2509700	Why don't you get fed? Get fed.
2511700	2514460	Hello, Dan. Hello.
2514460	2518260	Should I get in the bed like Lolly gets into bed with Kate?
2518260	2531420	Night. Did she go under the covers?
2531660	2536980	Yeah. Oh, go deep, go deep. Yeah.
2541220	2543460	That's Nigel, except night.
2545660	2548100	I find it hard to believe you're just this.
2548340	2550500	Pretty much Rob's butt's right in Dan's face.
2551660	2554980	I really didn't do that right, that's the wrong answers.
2556060	2557620	It's really hot in there, right?
2557620	2560380	He looked over at Kendall like, wow, New Yorkers are prudes.
2562780	2564740	Like Nigel, Nigel does this, does it.
2564740	2565460	But he doesn't.
2565460	2568780	He the way he digs is with both front paws in unison.
2569100	2570340	So he like, oh, really?
2570340	2572020	Yeah, it's kind of funny.
2572020	2574900	Also, he's he's back to full health now because he's he
2574900	2578260	humped the fuck out of Harvey today.
2578260	2579780	Does he know that that's not going to go anywhere,
2579780	2581060	that that's self-destructive behavior?
2581060	2584980	He's absolutely doing it when when they play fetch and Harvey gets the ball.
2584980	2588460	He waits for Harvey to come back with the ball and then he humps him.
2588820	2592500	And then he like he just like finishes.
2592500	2595900	He doesn't orgasm, but he finishes dominating him.
2595900	2601140	And then he does this like hind leg like cat cat cat kind of burying
2601140	2604380	a turd kind of move like he scrapes dirt.
2604540	2605860	Phantom dirt at Harvey.
2605860	2607060	That's him spiking the football.
2607060	2608460	Yeah, he's like, oh, it's great.
2608460	2609100	You're giant.
2609100	2610500	So you get the ball whenever you want.
2610500	2611420	But guess who?
2611420	2612900	Guess he gets the phantom.
2612900	2613660	Fuck you.
2613660	2619180	So when you went into the doctor and he opened the door and you're sitting,
2620020	2623420	you know, in the robe and everything and you just pointed at your forehead.
2624820	2630220	Did it did it take a look at it a long time and then went, oh, you got this
2630620	2633580	form herpes shingles.
2633820	2637980	Now he first I told him about I was like, look, I fell.
2638020	2641620	But I think I also got a rash from like a New York pillowcase or something.
2642300	2644580	Is that what they call them now?
2644580	2647420	And he like zoomed in on the rash.
2647420	2649300	A New York pillowcase is when you poop on somebody's chest.
2649300	2650420	Yeah.
2650420	2653660	I guess my doctor is really good or sees a ton of people with shingles
2653660	2657980	because he was just like I talked to him for like 10 seconds.
2658540	2662780	I have I have I I always record my doctor sessions
2662780	2664860	in case he says something that I need to remember later.
2665140	2670300	And the audio file from me walking from him walking in, not me walking
2670300	2674260	him, but him walking in to see me to me walking out the door and remembering
2674260	2676980	to hit stop five minutes and seven seconds.
2677260	2682500	And the guy like like, whoa, he like I was like, I said a couple of things
2682500	2684580	about what I was thinking.
2684580	2685620	I was all over the place.
2685620	2687540	He's like looking at me while I was talking.
2687540	2688940	He's like, you know what?
2688940	2690700	Worst case scenario, shingles.
2690700	2692940	Let's treat it like shingles because that's the worst.
2692940	2694700	We got to treat that right away if that's what it is.
2694700	2697020	If it's something else, who gives a fuck?
2697020	2699020	Did he when did he say herpes?
2699020	2700220	He never said the word herpes.
2700220	2701620	I find that out online.
2701620	2704500	I it's postherpetic, something right.
2704980	2706540	I had the same thing.
2706540	2711500	I had I was on a bad flight like back from San Francisco.
2711500	2714100	And it was like like going.
2714100	2721620	Oh, like like over the intercom.
2721620	2726780	Like the stewardess was like, oh, people just sit down, just sit down.
2726820	2728260	You know, that's how bad it was.
2728300	2732180	And I was just like holding on, holding my breath the entire time.
2732180	2735580	And when I got off the plane, I had like this rash that was
2735580	2743460	grew above my, my eyelid and I went to the doctor and he looked at it.
2743460	2747940	And he was, oh, you got herpes roster zoster zoster.
2747940	2749340	Yeah, that's shingles.
2749340	2751180	Yeah, I can't believe he called it that.
2751180	2754500	Yeah, but but I went, what herpes?
2754500	2759300	No, I mean, I mean, like that's why I think it shingles such a fun name.
2759300	2763900	I guess we're finding out why, but but he said it like, oh, that's herpes.
2764460	2770100	And that guy and and what he should have done was not the kind you think of
2770700	2773500	because that's the only kind anybody thinks of.
2773500	2774580	They don't think. Right.
2774580	2776180	Is this the kind I have to say on dates?
2776180	2781620	Yeah, yeah. So that was his moment for that day to get some excitement or something.
2781860	2782940	He needed to respond.
2782940	2788020	But but he didn't like, you know, so I was like, but it what did I didn't
2788020	2791940	rub my head on a thing that gives you the herpes?
2793260	2797060	And and he was and he was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2797060	2800300	No, it's let's do wear one of the pussy hats, though.
2800300	2801940	Not one of those.
2801940	2803740	That's why they made those pussy hats.
2803740	2808100	So Keith Himda, try to do it,
2808340	2812620	try to natural one there, Himda, Keith, more of a kuh on it.
2812820	2815340	I noticed that. How do you do it?
2815340	2817140	No, how do you say her name, Kenda?
2817140	2819060	And then now you say it, Kenda.
2819060	2819860	See, it's different.
2819860	2821420	He puts more of a kuh.
2821420	2822780	He was born in a different place.
2822780	2824460	I'm finally getting it right.
2824460	2827420	Took 13 years. You guys ever you guys ever have a fight
2827420	2829700	in all those thousands of episodes?
2829700	2833500	Like, like, I mean, like, like, like a bad one.
2833500	2836020	Not like it's, oh, this is such provocative entertainment
2836020	2837540	because they disagree so much.
2837540	2840980	But like, you fight and it's like, shit, they're like pissed.
2841300	2843500	Yeah. Yeah. What was it called?
2843500	2845460	That there's the first one that we had.
2845460	2847660	We don't bring up all the fights. I don't know.
2848060	2849740	He he shed it off in the middle.
2849740	2851140	He's like, well, now we're really fighting.
2851140	2853460	And I was like, but we do everything else on air.
2853460	2855340	So just turn it back on and let's finish.
2855340	2858460	And it was it actually helped because a lot of times
2858460	2861540	he'll just stare at me when I'm when I'm trying to argue with him.
2861540	2863220	And it's like, how boring is that?
2863220	2865900	And how much at all the points anyway, you know.
2865900	2867900	Yeah. And he just really just literally stares.
2867900	2870260	But if if he's in front of a mic, he can't stare.
2870260	2871940	So he was forced to respond to me.
2871940	2875780	Are you in new relationships now or is this still like are you?
2875820	2877500	Oh, no, this is like 10, 10 years ago.
2877500	2878980	She's married now. Oh, OK.
2878980	2880820	Yeah, she's not. She moved on. Yes.
2880820	2882900	Whereas Keith is holding on to this for dear life.
2882900	2885980	Who knows? You just live the universe will give what the universe gives, right?
2887260	2888300	It's going to all be the universe.
2888300	2889380	Fucking with Keith.
2889380	2891860	Do you think there are good and bad people?
2892700	2894060	Yeah, of course.
2894060	2896100	Like, what do you think is responsible for that?
2896100	2897340	Do you think they're boring, good and bad?
2897340	2898860	Or do you think it's there?
2898860	2901620	They just get the luck of the draw and they're no better.
2901620	2903860	A lot of it starts with, you know, it just is what it is.
2903860	2907500	And then you you take your personality whichever way you want.
2907500	2912860	You realize people need help and you're here to serve or you don't.
2913460	2916060	And you're selfish.
2916060	2917980	I think it's that simple, I think.
2917980	2922260	So we're being tested every day in big and small ways to like, like,
2922300	2926180	usually we can get by by probably not like doing too much of an extreme choice.
2926180	2929300	But basically, there are people who are like, you know what?
2929940	2933900	It's it's been three Wednesdays in a row since Mercury's in retrograde.
2933900	2937700	And I'm just going to kill this dog with a knife or something like like, like,
2938060	2940820	like, I guess that's a bad example because that sounds like a compulsion
2940820	2941980	that someone would have an example.
2941980	2943020	I feel like I missed the step.
2943020	2943780	I mean, I get it.
2943780	2948420	I'm trying to think of like, because I don't know if I think it's like being healthy.
2948420	2953180	I think everybody prefers to be in shape, but they don't want to do the work.
2953220	2954940	Yes. You know, they don't want to exercise.
2954940	2956260	They don't want to eat healthy.
2956260	2959300	But if they did, they would look better and probably feel better.
2959300	2961700	And I think that's what it's like to be.
2961700	2965580	I think when you're bad, when you're evil, you're being lazy.
2965900	2968620	And when you're being good, you're actually putting some effort into life.
2968780	2971340	Yes, I don't know. I have I just said.
2971580	2972860	I have a problem.
2972860	2974060	I mean, I don't have a problem.
2974060	2976260	You guys are allowed to think that way because I'm a good person.
2977340	2983820	But I just I just feel like then I but then I start to like micro scope that and go,
2983820	2991220	well, yeah, but if I'm if I'm lazy and then I decide to start working out like,
2991220	2995540	OK, now I feel like I'm a good person because it was harder to do that than it was.
2995740	2997980	But it's still what I felt like doing.
2997980	3001100	I mean, you get it, I guess it gets into that whole stupid philosophical
3001100	3003500	like free will versus fate thing.
3003500	3008420	I mean, like if my brain chemistry is going to result, are we on some synaptic level
3008420	3012340	making fucking choices like and it's like this.
3012340	3016180	Like if I'm like if Kate says, hey, let's go for a hike.
3016220	3017220	I go.
3022420	3023420	Like I'm there.
3024220	3032060	And then but if I go, I'm walking and I'm having a good time and it's nice.
3032060	3034060	And then I go, I'm glad I did that.
3034060	3036420	I like doing that. That's fun.
3036420	3037420	I always say.
3044820	3048100	What if she says whenever she says, let's go for a hike.
3048460	3050460	So the next time she says, let's go for a hike.
3050460	3053060	I know this time I'm not going to do that noise.
3053060	3054980	But do you do it anyway? I do it anyway.
3054980	3056460	Yeah. Yeah.
3056460	3061180	I kind of like maybe maybe good and bad is maybe the way I can buy into it is
3061180	3062620	is healthy and unhealthy.
3062620	3063900	Like we all get depressed.
3063900	3068140	We all get like and so or like it's like a sink full of dishes.
3068140	3070380	Like nobody wants to do the dishes.
3070380	3075340	But like you don't it's not like, oh, this battle of it's just sort of like,
3075340	3080020	like I don't know if somebody told you that eating a dog turd made you live
3080020	3081820	another 50 years.
3081820	3084580	You either you either eat the dog turd or you don't.
3084580	3087020	And I don't think that makes you a good or a bad person.
3087260	3090940	But you if you eat it and they were telling the truth and you live for another
3090940	3094820	50 years, there might be all kinds of other side effects to like, oh,
3094820	3097980	the reason for that is because there's like an enzyme in dog turds that like
3097980	3102780	also like lifts your psychology or it's like there's vitamin D and dog turds
3102780	3103460	and all this stuff.
3103460	3106220	So along the way, you're gaining all these benefits and you're like thinking
3106220	3109100	more clearly and you're so that and then you're like, well, dude,
3109100	3112500	I ate dog shit the other day and I feel like a million bucks.
3112500	3114860	So then this homeless guy goes, hey, can I have two dollars?
3114860	3116300	And you're like, you know what, fuck it.
3116300	3118740	Here's two dollars in that Jim Carrey movie kind of thing.
3118740	3121940	And you're like, so the whole time it's like you could I think it's like you
3121940	3126420	could that's the way I look at it is like there's people who are in in like
3126420	3130740	they're like resonating with the they're like sick and there's people who are.
3130860	3132660	So yeah, he's kind of talking about that.
3132660	3135980	Keith is more black and white and I'm more gray on the show and off.
3135980	3140380	So, for example, a close friend of mine, we actually were roommates
3140380	3143460	with each other with my husband with that bill.
3143500	3144900	Johnny, you were close.
3144900	3149580	Yes, Johnny, you know, and he was he was our roommate for a little while.
3149580	3154260	And we could sense that he was the stress of life was starting to kind of skew
3154260	3158300	his thinking and skew like his response to life in general
3158300	3160380	and to go into work and things like that.
3160380	3163300	And then we had to separate ways.
3163300	3168060	We were all moving and he got but heard about it and spray painted the entire
3168060	3171540	house and just let me be clear how bad the spray painting was,
3171540	3175940	not only on all the walls, but like an asshole in all the corners.
3176580	3178860	When you repaint, you have to repaint the corner.
3179460	3183620	Fuck you. So so it didn't happen.
3183620	3185540	You've been hurt by painting before.
3185540	3186940	It's not good. I'd rather eat dog shit.
3186940	3188260	And I'm not exaggerating.
3188260	3190940	It makes you live long hearing good things.
3191140	3193780	So his point was this guy is just bad news.
3193780	3197020	He's a bad person and, you know, no one should deal with him.
3197020	3199100	He should be locked up for however long.
3199100	3202100	And and my thing is he should be spray painted.
3202700	3205020	His brain in the corners glitched.
3205020	3207820	And I should stay away from him for now.
3207820	3212500	But I believe that he can he can find another path
3212500	3216260	and become a good person until he does.
3216500	3219820	Keith is right. Well, I guess not about that.
3220340	3223980	It just is. Yeah, I remember I've told this story before
3223980	3228260	because like I broke up with a girlfriend or she she broke up with me.
3228260	3229620	So I was all fucked off about it.
3229620	3232900	And she was mutual friends with all my friends.
3232900	3236700	And like and then I was I was just handling the breakup really poorly.
3236700	3240540	And I just like I couldn't stop thinking about her and all this stuff.
3240540	3242580	And I was just a drag to be around.
3242580	3247940	And and and I found out that everybody was in Palm Springs without me.
3248140	3250380	And and I was like, what the fuck?
3250380	3254460	You guys don't even like me now is you like her more than me and all this stuff.
3254460	3256700	And I was like, it's just having this terrible day.
3256900	3262460	And and my friend Dino said, look, I know we love you.
3262460	3265260	We just it's it's not a it's not a bad.
3265260	3268300	It doesn't make you a bad person if people don't want to be around you.
3268340	3269540	It's like you have a cold.
3269540	3271340	It's like you have snot dripping out of your face.
3271340	3272940	Like we can't wait for you to get better.
3272940	3275140	That's it. And I was like, oh, oh.
3275580	3277860	And then I was like, yeah, OK, so I'm sick.
3277940	3283700	Like I have a sickness called like I I hate myself and I hate my girlfriend
3283700	3285500	and I hate my friends and I hate everybody.
3285500	3288580	And I wish that like, you know, it's like it's just all sickness.
3288580	3291940	She had a sickness called forgetting to bring tents, water and food.
3292220	3294420	Well, that's what you get. Don't fucking choose her.
3295900	3298420	That's true. I went to a hospital, a hospital.
3298420	3300780	Jesus Christ. I went to a hotel.
3300780	3304780	We heard because I just I didn't trust
3305420	3308980	that the camping would be fun with that group of friends.
3309300	3312460	And sure enough, they forgot to bring everything essential.
3312820	3316300	And they all had to like go back on making fun of me for getting the hotel.
3316820	3319300	And they all came and stayed in my hotel.
3319300	3321740	Jerks. What do they think a camping trip is?
3322820	3325580	They think it's bringing tents and bringing food and water,
3325580	3327500	but they forgot to do all those things.
3327500	3328780	They left it all back at home.
3328780	3330260	That sounds like the good drugs.
3330260	3333900	Yeah. And I did acid and found myself sitting on a rock in the moonlight
3333980	3335940	talking to a rattlesnake.
3335940	3338220	But we were wondering if you were homeless.
3338220	3340180	We were like, well, support you.
3340180	3342380	What's happening? What did the rattlesnake say?
3343020	3346300	Rattlesnake was being groovy. I'm afraid of snakes.
3346300	3349140	I sat on a rock and the rock was going on, Jeff.
3349540	3352180	Oh, it's a kind of and it was talking to me.
3352660	3354300	Did he tell you to eat the apple?
3354300	3357300	But I kept hearing about these apples.
3358020	3359380	It's a sketch. It's a sketch. OK.
3359380	3362220	Jeff Davis. You're in a thing right now.
3362580	3364300	You're in my thing.
3364300	3366340	Oh, yeah, you should totally eat the apple.
3366340	3368540	Eat my nuts.
3368540	3371820	Snakes are a nut tree. Eat my nuts.
3373180	3375900	Eat my eat, eat my balls.
3376940	3379500	Eat my. Wait, is this the rattlesnake talking?
3379500	3381660	I'm sitting next to me on this right now, Stan.
3383180	3384700	Why are you calling me Dan?
3384700	3386980	Sorry. OK. All right. Never mind.
3386980	3389180	OK. Oh, well, that sketch fucking didn't get off the ground.
3389180	3391220	No, no, no, no. I fucked up.
3391260	3392780	That's why you don't plan things.
3392780	3393620	I don't plan it.
3393620	3395780	I'm afraid of snakes, especially poisonous.
3395780	3397580	You don't like kill you in the middle of the night, snakes.
3397580	3399580	And baby snakes are going to bite you first
3399580	3401580	because they're not trained to like kind of keep it cool.
3401580	3404180	They eat you from the toes up.
3404180	3407380	So they eat you from.
3407380	3409940	Did you see that elephant that got eaten?
3409940	3411900	I think you're dead by the time it starts eating you, though.
3411900	3414940	That's how they do it. That's how they get you start with the toes.
3414940	3419860	I kept hearing the buzzing of bugs and the bugs.
3419860	3421820	And the rock is talking to me.
3421820	3424820	And I look over and now it's a it's a it's a rattlesnake,
3424820	3425900	a little baby rattlesnake.
3425900	3427300	It's sitting right next to me.
3427300	3430740	I'm like, hey, little buddy, like you should you should move on.
3430740	3434500	And Mark Rivers comes up with a big floodlight and goes, Jeff,
3435260	3436660	get the fuck out of there.
3436660	3438900	Like, hey, man, I'm fucking high.
3438900	3440180	I was I was grooving.
3440180	3441740	I was groovtastic with a rattlesnake.
3441740	3443540	Next day was not on acid
3443540	3446100	and duct taped my pants around my boots
3446740	3449340	because there were snakes all over the goddamn joint.
3449340	3450580	All right. I have one.
3450580	3453060	So you guys brought duct tape, but not a tent.
3453060	3454820	Just just just wondering.
3454820	3458380	I came quite a lot of ducks out in a desert.
3458380	3459380	A lot of people don't know that.
3459380	3461940	And that you can make tape out of the desert.
3461940	3464620	Ducks are dangerous. The most dangerous words.
3464620	3466660	Because they're like, how the fuck did I end up out here
3466660	3468620	where I can't even use a third of my ability?
3468620	3471220	I can't even use a third of my ability.
3471220	3474460	Sketch idea, duck desert and damn it.
3474460	3475660	I'm an all terrain chicken.
3475660	3477460	What am I doing in the one place
3477460	3479420	where I can't rub that in the chicken's face?
3479420	3481620	All right. Come on. Here's here's here's the one thing.
3481620	3484540	How handsome is Jeff? Yeah, it's good looking.
3484540	3487980	It's you know, but let's move on. Let's move on.
3487980	3490500	Let's keep talking about the whole show
3490500	3492540	about how good looking Jeff is.
3492540	3494580	Demours, you were asleep for a while there.
3494580	3496380	Were you not? Oh, Jesus Christ.
3496380	3498460	Demours had passed out from here.
3498460	3500700	Hey, guys. Congratulations on Arsenal.
3500700	3501900	Like you said, I'm curious.
3501900	3504100	Do you grow out your hair and wear your pajamas?
3504100	3506780	And it's like you can't even get close to comparing me to Jeff
3506780	3508180	because obviously. Yeah.
3508180	3510420	I mean, I'm not even trying to make it a contest.
3510420	3514620	Exactly. It's like I just I just stay under Jeff's bridge
3514620	3517660	and charge charge toll for whoever comes over it.
3520060	3522060	There's one thing now that my nervous system is jacked up.
3522060	3524180	I was going to save this for a non shingles.
3524180	3527100	But now I can feel the herpes coursing through my my my.
3527100	3532020	I just wanted to bring up one thing and get to the bottom of it.
3532340	3535740	A Venetian blinds.
3536180	3537780	What the fuck?
3537780	3542500	Like, what is the fucking rule with what direction to pull the fucking string
3542500	3545060	in around the neck to make them stay?
3546100	3549020	Are you supposed to pull them to the left or the right?
3549420	3555740	You pull them inward at a diagonal angle to to have them go up and down.
3556180	3557740	Right. And then you have it.
3557740	3561100	And then you pull it straight down for them to stop.
3562220	3563980	It's like a hand job, kind of.
3563980	3569020	What if I want to pull my Venetian blinds up halfway and lock them in place halfway?
3569020	3569780	What am I doing?
3569780	3572580	Yeah, so you pull diagonal until it's about halfway
3572580	3574980	and then you would then swivel over.
3575300	3579580	Yeah. And then bring it wheel it down so it's vertical.
3579900	3582740	And then the fuck is up with this backboard?
3583740	3584900	Look at this shit.
3584900	3586740	I get three sticks.
3586740	3590220	He's got three sticks back hurts for the folks at home.
3590700	3595620	The bed frame has three sticks and a large hole for a pillow to fall through.
3596300	3596820	Yeah, it hurts.
3596820	3598980	They just assume we've got a wall.
3598980	3602260	I used the fact that I was hot to get out of there because it was it was fucking.
3602260	3605980	You said he was hot, but it was really the three sticks.
3606020	3607620	Oh, my God.
3607620	3609260	Why is that even an option?
3609260	3611100	Do you want a backboard?
3611100	3612500	How about just the frame?
3612500	3614460	Not any of the.
3614460	3616220	Just the frame.
3616220	3619220	We've we've got to set this thing up before the show
3619740	3624020	and putting putting the whole backboard up is going to take some time.
3624020	3627060	Grown as adults, we're finally tackling the intricacies
3627060	3630060	of Venetian blinds and IKEA headboards.
3630180	3632860	How do you do you know how to work the fucking blinds when you want to make them?
3632860	3634460	Like, how about this here?
3634460	3638060	Forget about how to lift them up and make a block because that's easy.
3639100	3642660	Suppose they're halfway up and you want you want to do is very quickly,
3642820	3645820	very quickly with because you got other things on your mind.
3645820	3648300	There's a reason you're going to close the blinds.
3648300	3649620	How do you release them?
3649620	3653620	And they go all the way down without stopping a quarter of the way down.
3653620	3656020	You pull them at a diagonal slightly.
3656500	3657860	You got to get after you do that.
3657860	3659060	You got to get a little lube.
3659060	3664300	Trump is about to play a dream to pull, you know, get some hymns.
3664340	3666180	I think Ken's the cutest.
3669380	3671380	I think Ken's diagonal.
3671820	3675420	It's not it's not intuitive, but once you get it down,
3675420	3677460	you're like, holy shit, am I a wizard?
3677460	3680740	If you look at the little sprocket up there when you're doing it, it makes sense.
3680740	3684740	You know, I will when you look at it, it does not make sense.
3685340	3687540	It just looks confusing as fuck.
3687540	3688620	Well, I'm an engineer.
3688620	3690980	Yeah, no, Jeff's a genius.
3690980	3692860	And I'm sure he understands it.
3692860	3693780	Don't get me right.
3693780	3697060	I come from a long line of levelers and knobs.
3697340	3699140	We change our name to Davis during World War Two
3699140	3701420	because levelers were also hoarding Nazi gold.
3701700	3704300	Are you an outdoorsman, Keith?
3704380	3706580	No, I could play along for a little bit.
3706580	3709860	I enjoy I do enjoy camping because you're doing nothing.
3710220	3711780	But no, here in L.A.
3711780	3715100	Canada keeps running Runyon Canyon and trying to get me to go.
3715300	3718260	And I go, oh,
3721260	3723220	I caught one of the conversations you were having.
3723220	3726380	It caught a little piece of you talking about the landmark.
3726700	3728660	Mind your fucking business.
3729660	3732140	Did you did you did you really go to the I did?
3732940	3734940	Yeah, Landmark is this.
3735140	3736260	It's a group setting.
3736260	3737820	It's a therapy, but group therapy.
3737820	3740940	So and I do not believe these guys can do one on one therapy.
3741180	3745460	But my ex wife, when she left me and Landmark pushed her to do it,
3745860	3747020	she paid for me to go to.
3747020	3748180	So I thought that was sweet.
3748180	3753140	No, I've had that, but I've never gone because it just seems like like, you know.
3753180	3755780	Yeah, you get your you get your two or three lessons.
3755780	3757740	You could have got anywhere else.
3757740	3759940	It's upwards of a thousand dollars.
3759940	3763980	And then other lessons they throw in are how to stand up for yourself.
3764420	3766420	For and they have us do an example.
3766420	3770540	And then this example, I will say to you, why don't you come to a landmark seminar
3770620	3772340	and you tell me no. Right.
3772340	3775300	And then I will keep trying to convince you and you keep saying no.
3775340	3776940	And so until you've given me a thousand.
3776940	3779180	Yeah, that is you standing up for yourself.
3779300	3781860	I remember a friend of several friends who told me about it.
3781860	3786740	And then I got like, I remember one of them said, oh, I do this landmark thing.
3786740	3788220	And I said, is that a cult?
3788220	3791820	And, you know, the tea and cult hadn't come out of my mouth.
3791820	3795620	And she without anger, like a well-trained like
3796820	3800500	aquarium creature, like like like just like that
3800500	3804380	that that saw a glint of a herring spoon and knows exactly which hoops to jump.
3804380	3806260	There was like, well, do you know what a cult is?
3806260	3808100	The definition of a cult is the following things.
3808100	3809860	And she ran through the entire definition of a cult.
3809860	3814300	And I was like, well, can I add one thing, which is that you have a rehearsed
3814300	3817700	like speech about whether you're a cult because I think it's in their FAQs.
3817700	3818700	Well, our guy, no joke.
3818700	3822500	The guy leading the thing is like, people are going to ask you, is it a cult?
3822700	3823940	And I'm like, all right.
3823940	3825780	Let me hear how you answer that.
3825780	3828260	Well, then that's a cult I want to be a part of.
3829980	3834740	Am I right? And of course, everybody wants to fit in and they start to change.
3834740	3840700	I mean, we are totally unfair to cult is like the word hipster in terms of religion.
3840700	3843380	Like we just we just use it for things that we don't like.
3843380	3847660	I mean, we just like, oh, it's creepy or it's weird or we don't like it.
3847700	3852220	Like we I'll I'll tell you the definition later because you could be a Mormon
3852220	3855060	and talk about someone else's religion as if it's a cult.
3855060	3860660	I remember when I was in like senior year of high school and I was like going to go
3860660	3863540	to Madison where you're driving to Madison.
3863540	3866300	And parents are like, why are you going to Madison?
3866300	3871860	It's like, oh, I'm going to go see this move, this cult movie at midnight.
3871860	3873140	It's going to be cool.
3873140	3877340	And they sat me down and I had they gave me this
3877340	3883100	lecture about like how cults are bad and that it's against Jesus Christ.
3883100	3888220	And we're really, really we really are concerned about what you're going to do,
3888220	3889460	why you want to see this.
3889460	3891500	I'm going to see The Toxic Avenger.
3891500	3894580	What the fuck? Are you serious?
3894580	3896940	Dave and Donna, that's what you think.
3896940	3901180	I'm going to go see The Toxic, a fucking Avenger at midnight at Madison.
3901180	3904340	And you're worried about my immortal soul.
3904340	3907380	Close to a cult movie.
3907380	3910940	Well, they have been they see Death Race 2000.
3910940	3913900	Did you go? Fuck. Yeah, I went, man.
3913900	3915220	Did you join the cult? Yeah.
3915220	3917580	I bought the T-shirt and drank the Kool-Aid.
3917580	3919780	And did you buy the sneakers?
3920380	3924820	Ah, I have been going to a Buddhist temple.
3927340	3931260	And it's quite it's been quite good.
3931740	3934460	How do you like it? Are you meditating?
3934460	3935860	And yeah, it's great. Yeah.
3935860	3937980	Are you Zen? Yeah, yeah.
3937980	3939300	It's still going good.
3939300	3940940	Is that why you shaved recently?
3940940	3943900	What's that like to fit in with the monks?
3944420	3945980	No, I'm bald. I know.
3945980	3948380	But it looks good.
3948380	3951060	Thank you. It's like you freshen.
3951060	3952420	You freshen it up.
3952420	3953980	I freshen it up.
3953980	3955780	How regularly do you go? Huh?
3955780	3957540	How regularly do you go? Oh, that's a good question.
3957540	3959500	I've only gone once. OK.
3959540	3963300	So so you chose every last Monday.
3964220	3966780	OK, so they haven't done the thing yet
3966780	3969340	where where the Buddhist monk comes out and he goes like, Now, listen,
3970140	3972140	that was all free.
3972140	3976300	But I for the next hour, I want you to go out to the phones.
3976300	3978700	I want you to call five people for every five people.
3978700	3980780	You get into Buddhism, you come back.
3980780	3983100	That actually didn't happen. That's not what they did.
3983100	3987220	But the guy, the leader, the whatever the what?
3987220	3988860	The president that sits in the front.
3988860	3990300	What is the president?
3990300	3992660	What's the guy, the president, Buddha?
3992660	3993700	No, no, no, no.
3993700	3994860	That's so easy to remember.
3994860	3996900	The Buddhist priest, Dale Buddha.
3996900	4002220	No, he he's he's the booty side of like a Jim Carrey type.
4002220	4004300	You know, he would like, oh, so we do Jim Carrey.
4004300	4006140	We do this. Namaste.
4006140	4009380	We do this a little bit like he would be like.
4009780	4012780	So does anybody have any questions?
4014260	4015340	Wait, wait. Oh, my God.
4015340	4018020	He was he was Poland.
4018180	4020220	9-11. What's happening?
4020220	4022660	11. We have an alarm going up.
4025300	4026900	It's every time you look, isn't it?
4026900	4029540	It's too late. It's actually 11-6.
4029540	4031460	Steve Levy, you think of everything.
4031460	4033700	Not in front of the New Yorkers.
4033700	4036700	Oh, wow, guys. Wow.
4036700	4037980	It's a big joke to us out here.
4037980	4040300	Wow. We give all the shingles.
4040300	4043180	We do all the 9-11s. OK. OK.
4043940	4045980	Hey, let me ask you guys this.
4045980	4049060	If you want to get out of this new bed, some bugs.
4049060	4051180	All right. Right. Right.
4051180	4053060	I told my I told my landlord once.
4053060	4055460	I'm like, I'm very sure that I saw one bed bug.
4055460	4057060	He's like, oh, OK.
4057060	4059060	You think I should call somebody?
4059060	4060580	Like, it's your place.
4060580	4061780	The end.
4063580	4064740	I'm like, it's your place.
4064740	4068260	Should I should I call one exterminator?
4069620	4072460	So Keith and Kenda,
4072460	4076420	that was the way at this point.
4079260	4082860	Do we podcast for other people or for ourselves?
4082860	4085980	Why do you keep doing it since you've been doing it longer?
4086220	4088140	We're changing the road a little bit each time.
4088140	4090540	We'll be done in two and a half years. Oh, yeah.
4091740	4096100	We both both. We there's obviously probably just ego maniacs
4096100	4097020	and haven't figured it out.
4097020	4099100	And as soon as we do, we'll we'll stop.
4099100	4100220	There's an urge to do it.
4100220	4102100	And also it pays our bills.
4103020	4106180	But, you know, obviously getting in letters about that
4106180	4107940	sound almost like we saved the person's life.
4107940	4109340	That's beyond thrilling.
4109340	4111540	So you're saying it's possible to do a podcast for years and years
4111540	4114500	and make money at it? Yes.
4114660	4116140	Wait a second.
4116140	4117860	Well, we might need to look at this.
4117860	4120940	I mean, now that we're on Starburns, we're rich.
4121900	4123540	Wait a second.
4123540	4124540	We'll be talking.
4124540	4126780	Maybe I mean, all I've gotten is underwear out of this.
4127500	4129300	And rich and underwear.
4129300	4132500	And me. So I don't have any me socks and blue apron.
4132980	4134980	So the apron never gave me a fucking anything.
4134980	4138180	Well, that's because he didn't ask because they would if you wanted
4138180	4139380	for a boner pill company.
4139380	4141420	I don't need a boner pill company.
4141420	4144300	That's why I have a full up your eyeballs and boner works.
4144300	4146940	And I'm fucking chilling for this. Prove it. Prove.
4147900	4150620	Jeff, for hymns isn't about making your dick work.
4150620	4153500	It's about making sure your dick doesn't stop working.
4153700	4155620	Do you think I could fit under this bed?
4155620	4157420	Yes. Yeah, no, definitely.
4159660	4161860	I was right.
4163660	4166100	Oh, no. What happened at work today, sweetheart?
4171820	4174580	What are you? What is he broke the bed and hurt himself?
4174580	4176020	Really bad. Kill yourself.
4176020	4179940	It's not like they're not a sturdy frame.
4179980	4182660	This is the opposite of stage diving.
4182660	4186700	Now that you guys have a guest driven podcast, like, what do you have?
4186700	4191620	Any pointers on, like, like how to do good interviews or like, like,
4191620	4195380	like, is there anything to when you're in the when you're is it?
4195860	4199060	I think it's about being present and you don't want distractions
4199060	4203180	going on, perhaps so that you can have a real connection with the guest
4203180	4206500	because it's like the word is like they're your guests,
4206500	4211620	like you want to treat them with respect and know that, you know, you're there
4211620	4213020	and they're going to make your show.
4213020	4215860	They're there for you. They're there for you as much as they are for them.
4215860	4219380	Yeah. So just do do do unto others.
4220020	4224140	Yes. Just show that you care and that you respected their time.
4224700	4229140	Right. Who is your favorite guest that you guys have ever had?
4229140	4233460	We had a guest that just sat in the chair and was normal.
4234580	4236940	That was a good time.
4236940	4239260	That sounds really fun. How did that go?
4239260	4241820	It went very well because then you can get to know them.
4241820	4244460	They share what's happening on in their lives.
4244740	4247420	You're right. You're saying something that you can relate to
4247420	4249020	and you actually leave there.
4249020	4250940	Everybody learned something. We'd be out of it.
4250940	4253180	And you know, out of it, you're ashamed of yourself.
4253180	4257020	You're probably cementing and forming new relationships.
4257020	4258620	You're forming new bonds.
4258620	4260420	You're forming new bonds, people.
4260420	4262060	And I think that's the excitement.
4262060	4267140	And even after doing this for over 13 years, you still you still learn from each person.
4267140	4268820	You learn from new people.
4268820	4272780	When you open yourself up to new people, you can really learn a lot
4272780	4275620	that you couldn't otherwise if you if you close yourself off.
4275620	4279260	Yeah. And I'm not saying 44 years old, but even at 44, you think, all right,
4279260	4281260	did I meet every different kind of person?
4281260	4283820	And when you get people to open up, you really didn't.
4283860	4286540	So you're my what? You're my age.
4286540	4290340	You're actually that means you've been doing this for so long.
4290340	4291700	I'm not your age. I knew your age.
4291700	4294860	I don't want to get you to say it. Oh, I'm 32. Oh, Jesus.
4294860	4297140	No, I'm 24. Oh, because you would have been eight when I.
4299580	4302300	Now, Dan, yeah, are we worried about your drinking?
4303580	4307140	I don't know. OK, I mean, I did all I can go ahead.
4308500	4310380	Worry away if that's what you drunk.
4310380	4312380	You fought like a lion king.
4314140	4317420	Every everybody everybody's got their own medicine for a lot of people.
4317420	4320260	Worrying about my drinking seems to get them through the day.
4321780	4324460	I got my own methods.
4324460	4325500	How's he doing under there?
4325500	4327820	He's he's he's he's making some headway.
4328700	4331940	Literally, I don't I don't I don't want to check
4332100	4334380	with him about what his goals were.
4334380	4337460	He I remember him saying, do you think I can get under the bed?
4337460	4339460	I think I think I got under.
4339660	4342300	He's definitely under. I got out of the bed.
4342300	4344580	You do it. Whoever uses the space.
4344580	4347020	I only I can get out, though.
4347020	4348580	I don't think I can get out of the.
4348580	4351700	That's yeah, you should have done that before you tried to go into the bed.
4351700	4354220	Shrap. I think I'm stuck under the bed now.
4354460	4356540	That might be OK. Did you find the honey?
4357140	4359300	Yeah. It's the honey under there.
4359300	4361500	I think I thought the honey Winnie the Pooh.
4361540	4364260	Oh, OK. It's his way that poos.
4364420	4365940	He's notoriously stuck under.
4365940	4366740	Oh, he gets. Oh, yeah.
4366740	4368900	He gets stuck in his little tuchus of sticking out of the.
4368900	4371940	Yeah. And then somebody puts a vodka bottle up his butt.
4371940	4373100	It's like the same thing.
4373100	4374660	Everyone's having the whole book.
4374660	4376820	I didn't think that was funny.
4376820	4377780	You did. Right. Yeah.
4377780	4378700	It's a different time.
4378700	4379780	I'm pretty sure it was funny.
4379780	4381140	Look at what you were wearing.
4381140	4382420	Gross. Right.
4382420	4383780	You were asking for it.
4383780	4386540	Sure. If you didn't want a giant kettle, one bottle up your butt.
4387100	4388660	You don't know that.
4389300	4392100	I just found out that my favorite children's book is
4392300	4396060	there's a live adaptation of it happening somewhere in the area.
4396100	4398340	Coop Rancho Kookamooka.
4398340	4401500	What's it called? Kookamunga.
4401500	4403460	Yeah. Ricky Tiki Tavi.
4403460	4406140	No, that's not my favorite.
4406940	4407940	Boogie Little Puffy.
4407940	4409180	Nope, that's not it.
4409180	4411660	Dr. But see Spot Run.
4411780	4414300	Nope. My favorite is The Hard to Get Turtle.
4414300	4416780	No, I guess that was a.
4417580	4420540	Yeah, I love that one.
4420540	4424180	With all those animals, with all those turtles and colors.
4424340	4427700	Hard to get and word problems and word problems.
4427900	4430340	My favorite is Frederick by Leo Leone.
4430420	4432740	Boo. Oh, God. Boo.
4432740	4434140	A children's book that you don't even.
4434140	4435380	Jesus Christ.
4435380	4437540	That is a turgid piece of shit.
4437540	4439180	That's a pretentious kid's book.
4439180	4442860	It's my mom hated the hungry, hungry caterpillar.
4442860	4445780	And she used to talk to other moms that were like my sons
4445780	4447500	reading The Hungry, Hungry Caterpillar.
4447500	4450380	And she's like fucking hipsters.
4450380	4453060	I thought it was a good book, but, you know, whatever.
4453060	4457140	I liked There's a Monster at the end of this book.
4457220	4459780	Oh, yeah. And it was you all along.
4459980	4461780	No, it was Grover.
4461780	4463620	Oh, I thought it was a mirror.
4463620	4464500	Yeah, it was a mirror.
4464500	4468220	Did you get like a used book and so I just drew Grover.
4469940	4471580	His mom was a chippy pee pee.
4471580	4473260	Well, maybe the back of the page.
4473260	4476460	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
4476660	4479220	Now that he's trapped under the bed, let's make fun of him.
4479220	4481020	Hey, fuck you.
4481020	4482580	Hey, fuck you.
4482580	4483900	Hey, fuck you, Dan.
4483900	4485300	You get under this bed.
4485300	4488740	Was Peepee her maiden name or did she go under that bed and say that to him?
4489100	4490980	Get under. Yeah.
4490980	4492100	Peepee Longstocking.
4492100	4493700	Peepee Longstocking.
4493700	4494900	You don't get that, Monat.
4494900	4497660	No, this isn't your issue.
4498980	4500860	No, no kids.
4500860	4502340	No, no, thank you.
4502340	4507060	Oh, yeah, I think he was offering too much like don't want to bring him
4507060	4509140	into this world or too much like responsibility.
4509140	4511060	Like I still have to be a baby.
4511060	4513780	I yeah, I can't even believe that I'm in my 40s.
4513780	4516900	I still want somebody to make me dinner and do the things.
4516900	4518380	So I don't know why I would get up.
4518380	4523540	And also my brothers both had had kids and and they both said
4523540	4525660	it's so much more work than we thought.
4525660	4528060	And I was like, that's all mom and dad talked about that.
4528060	4529700	We were just a big pain in the ass.
4529700	4531300	Only there was a book on it.
4531300	4534700	I like being a lazy uncle, you know, you get to buy impractical gifts
4534700	4535940	and you don't have to fucking hang out.
4535940	4537780	I've never changed a poopy poops.
4537780	4538900	I changed the diaper.
4538900	4540060	You did the poops. Yeah.
4540060	4541740	Well, you're a better person.
4541740	4542940	Well, there's good people.
4542940	4544060	There's bad people, right?
4544060	4544860	I'm a bad person.
4544860	4547060	I don't want the poops or the peas or the thing.
4547380	4550540	You should probably wait until you have an uncontrollable like, oh, my God,
4550540	4554460	I got to have one and not that other feeling, which is like, oh, I bet they're great.
4555020	4558220	Yeah, I don't I never I think I got that because I was
4558820	4561900	um, they were teaching me to want that.
4561900	4564540	So like at 18, I felt my clock ticking.
4564540	4568020	But then when I turned 30, I was like, oh, everything they said was bullshit.
4568020	4569740	And then I just went about my day.
4569740	4573700	It was great. What a revelation to realize that a nightmare.
4573780	4575260	So many lies.
4575260	4576900	Yeah, you got to fucking hang out with them all the time.
4576900	4578540	And what if they're a dick?
4578540	4581060	Yeah, I mean, you don't even know for years.
4581060	4582940	And then it's like too late to take it back.
4582940	4585780	It's like crazy. There's no way you have a bad kid.
4585780	4587100	There's no way that I would have a child.
4587100	4588900	The child would be just mellow. Right.
4588900	4589980	And then they blame you.
4589980	4591700	Yeah. And I would they would be rights.
4591700	4593260	And I would want to not hang out with you.
4593260	4596940	I was wearing a suit, Jeff's kid.
4597180	4599140	That's my thing around the bar.
4599140	4601420	Because this guy is cramping my style.
4601420	4602460	He's trying to wear my suits.
4602460	4604020	I mean, you're not fucking tall enough for that shit.
4604020	4607100	Yeah, you can't I mean, I'll be into Minecraft pretty heavily.
4607100	4609780	And then I'll be like thinking about the dog needing to go out.
4609780	4612700	And I'm kind of like, you know, it's an animal.
4612700	4614260	I can hold it, you know.
4614260	4617500	And I'm like, if you had a kid, you never know way. Right.
4617820	4622820	But then I think about, you know, making a little Cody.
4624900	4626220	You got the name?
4626220	4627980	Oh, no, my girlfriend's name is Cody.
4627980	4630780	And and you know, you're not going to get a little code.
4630780	4632220	You're going to get a giant damn.
4632220	4633100	That's always the trick.
4633100	4637780	You're going to get a gross, gross, half-cody, half-fucking horrible shit monster.
4637780	4639380	Everyone wants a girl.
4639380	4641180	Yeah, that's true. You get a girl.
4641180	4644100	But if you get a girl, you have to like think about every true crime podcast.
4644100	4647020	You've heard. And if you have a guy, you can just be like, where are you going?
4647020	4648420	Oh, no. All right, fine.
4648420	4650340	You want me to tell you a rape story I read today?
4650340	4651540	What's that? A rape story.
4651540	4653780	Oh, yes, please.
4653780	4656020	Get the least we can provide you with as a guest.
4656020	4658740	Please have a rape corner.
4658740	4660420	You can have your own segment here.
4660420	4661020	It's deadly.
4661020	4663180	What's the what's the latest one that you?
4663180	4665300	Rape corner music here.
4665300	4667860	I'm sure this will be good.
4669380	4670180	I didn't really mean it.
4670180	4672580	All right, girls, 12 years old goes to school.
4673180	4673900	Welcome to Keith.
4673900	4676740	Malley is a reporter.
4676740	4678140	He was there. OK.
4678140	4681660	How to make things funny when they're really, really not.
4681940	4685620	The Keith Malley story, rape is really hot.
4685660	4689380	Go. So this kid thinks he has a relationship with his teacher
4689380	4691140	because he's very mature.
4691140	4694980	But no, the teachers is using them and invites him over to his house
4694980	4696860	and has sex with the child.
4696860	4699220	Keith Malley. Oh, Keith Malley.
4699820	4701020	That really happened.
4701020	4702340	Probably.
4702340	4703380	How about that Golden State?
4703380	4705660	Which one of those characters was you, Keith?
4705660	4706820	Don't worry, it happened.
4706820	4708940	Do you guys not care about the Golden State killer getting caught
4708940	4710780	because you're in the Eagle State?
4710780	4712660	We're still crying about 9-11.
4712660	4713860	Too busy not forgetting.
4713860	4715340	What's that? You guys moved on quick.
4715340	4717340	That was like, no, we never forget.
4717340	4718460	We set the alarm.
4718460	4719700	That was 11 minutes ago.
4719700	4720860	Keith, get over it.
4720860	4722580	I think that alarm was the show off.
4722580	4724820	I'm having a hard time breathing.
4724820	4726980	You want someone to pull you out by the feet, Rob?
4726980	4728820	No, no, no. Do not do that.
4728820	4731100	If New York is the Golden State, is that the motto?
4731100	4733660	Or is that the nickname?
4733660	4735140	We've never said it to each other.
4735140	4737820	And what's the New York equivalent of the Golden State?
4737820	4739220	The Big Apple.
4739220	4740820	No, that's the city.
4740820	4743020	The Empire of State. The whole state is fruit salad.
4743020	4744420	We're the Big Apple.
4744420	4745620	I can't stay mad at you.
4745620	4746660	The fruit basket.
4746660	4748380	Yeah, I feel bad. I don't know.
4748380	4751020	All right. The Empire of State, right.
4751020	4751980	Oh, the Empire of State.
4751980	4753620	Yeah.
4753620	4755620	Jeff, I totally got credit for that.
4755620	4759260	That was amazing that you had that trivia, Hamda.
4759260	4760740	Thank you. Thank you for understanding.
4760980	4763100	You know, sometimes it comes to you.
4763100	4765100	It's like when you've been podcasting this long.
4765100	4767220	Right. It's just the experience.
4767220	4768940	Yeah, we don't have that.
4768940	4771220	It's like a light bulb, but then you don't throw it on the ground
4771220	4772380	and let it chatter.
4772380	4774940	It's like a light bulb that you hold.
4774940	4777060	Have you gone back to Israel since you were four?
4777060	4780660	I have. Yeah, we used to go a lot every summer, every other summer.
4781020	4784180	And then like 10 years ago, my parents moved back.
4784180	4786220	I went a couple of times, but we no longer speak.
4786220	4788260	So you don't speak to your parents anywhere.
4788660	4791300	I can't tell if I don't speak to them or if they don't speak to me,
4791300	4792980	but we're not speaking. Wow.
4792980	4794860	It just kind of like fell apart.
4794860	4796980	That's like you, Dan, and your folks.
4797700	4800180	Well, I speak to my folks, but I could see.
4800580	4804180	I mean, I don't want my parents to hear me say I could see,
4804180	4808340	but it's it's like it's not held together with the kind of talk
4808340	4809780	to your brother anymore.
4809780	4811260	Right. You have a niece that you don't know.
4811260	4812540	I have a niece I've never met.
4812540	4814700	It's like Sesame Street bullshit going on.
4816700	4818220	Why don't you talk to your brother anymore?
4818420	4821380	My brother, I talked shit about him on the podcast.
4821380	4823260	What did you say? What did you say about him?
4823260	4827900	I implied that there was a strange kind of thing
4827900	4829540	when I was growing up between him and my mom.
4829540	4831980	I was just trying to be more glib than anything.
4832460	4835260	You know, I don't see what the big deal about that is.
4835260	4836900	That sounds like fine.
4836900	4841020	But I like I felt after I after I did it, you know, I was like, I was like, oh, shit.
4841020	4843300	My brother, I don't want my brother to hear that.
4843780	4846620	I don't want my brother to stumble onto this by himself.
4846620	4849820	You know, like so even though it sucks to like turn him on to it
4849820	4852020	because it could just get away with it.
4852020	4856380	I'm going to it would be so much worse if he just wandered into it
4856380	4859780	that I have to start to guess that, though, because maybe it's only
4859780	4863420	it's only telling him it must be so bad if you felt you had to give it to him.
4863460	4866340	Exactly. It's just but at that point, it's kind of like
4866340	4870380	it was the only right thing to do after the wrong I had done.
4870420	4873700	It's like you probably shouldn't talk about other people.
4873700	4874780	You should try not to.
4874780	4877260	I mean, was it was it real?
4877260	4878500	I don't know. Oh, it was.
4878500	4879620	That's why he was so mad.
4879620	4882140	Well, I mean, it wasn't it wasn't objective.
4882140	4885460	So it was it was it was it was I was sharing a subjective
4885460	4889060	like kind of feeling as it's just like my mom and my brother
4889060	4893180	had like an intense, more intense relationship than than than than me
4893180	4896100	and my mom had. I was like in front of a crowd.
4896100	4899620	So I kind of like, you know, as I said, like, I don't know.
4899620	4902100	I like I like I like I like being like
4903100	4906260	when I I don't like talking about my family anymore
4906260	4911460	as to go running or something just there for like I like I've now since
4911460	4914100	like I've been I've been I've been doing this for so long
4914100	4916700	that now I've gone through phases and one of them is like, I don't like
4916780	4921180	I just try to avoid talking about anybody but myself as much as I can.
4922780	4925820	But back then, I didn't really have any kind of rules.
4925820	4928820	I was still coming from a zone of like, you know what, whatever the fuck,
4928820	4931260	you know, if you encountered me in your life, then you're part of my
4931500	4937060	fucking tapestry. And and when I heard it afterwards and I was like,
4937060	4940860	I better I better email my brother so that even though it's going to suck.
4941020	4943420	And then I emailed him and then he prompt the email is,
4943820	4945340	do you think you should listen to it?
4945340	4947660	I don't think it's too much. It's very silly, but you should.
4947660	4950140	Anyway, I'm definitely going to keep it in my show.
4950140	4953620	Oh, yeah. Well, I'm not going to respect your brother.
4953860	4956940	Yeah, because it's not like I gave his address and like like said,
4956940	4959780	go talk to him about it. It's just like, I mean, it was just implied
4959780	4965460	you have sex with mom. It was I'd be more alarmed that someone
4965460	4968620	referred to me as my own chosen nickname, Darth Vader.
4969460	4971220	Well, yeah, I mean, I think it was all in there.
4971220	4974020	I think I kind of did a run where I was like, let me tell you about my brother.
4974340	4977420	And then so I heard it and I was like, I better I better, I better,
4977620	4980980	I better tip him off that I clowned him if I want to try to salvage anything
4980980	4983100	because he might get mad. He might he might not, though.
4983100	4985940	He might be like, whatever you fucking turn like, like,
4986740	4990060	and then he he must have listened to it and then he emailed me back.
4990060	4993740	And he was like, he was just like kind of inconsolable about it.
4993780	4997540	I probably also wasn't very good at resolving that kind of thing back then.
4998060	5000380	So I like that's why I don't talk to him.
5000580	5004180	It was also kind of coincided with him having the kid that I've never met.
5004420	5008700	And I think it was in some in some respects, like what he said
5008700	5011500	sounded healthy to me, which is like, oh, I just had a kid.
5011740	5013220	I'm sick of his family.
5013220	5015700	Like, I have a chance at a fresh start here,
5015700	5018020	which is something that my therapist constantly echoes, too.
5018020	5019260	She's like, you don't have to.
5019260	5023020	Don't let people tell you that you have to like, you know, have this connection
5023020	5025740	to these Walton Mountains that you grew up on.
5025740	5029060	You know, like that sometimes like just let them be, you know, like, you know,
5029060	5032260	like, thanks, like, like, like you got to find your own thing.
5032260	5033620	And like, like, like so.
5033620	5036820	And my brother was like, yeah, it's my chance to start my own thing
5036820	5038380	and like start it fresh.
5038380	5041020	And like my daughter will never know this weird.
5042020	5043420	Right, right.
5043420	5046500	She'll never she'll never know is her her her uncle.
5046620	5048780	Well, this is uncomfortable, but I hope.
5048780	5051220	OK, let's bring him out.
5051220	5053540	Bones, harmonies out of the bed.
5053540	5055340	How old is your nephew that you've never met?
5055340	5056820	Knees. Knees. Knees. Sorry.
5056820	5060820	I don't know. I say over, over, over 10.
5061660	5065460	You've never spoken to her, never any drive bys.
5066900	5068620	No, no. Start crying.
5068620	5070780	No, I think my mom sent me a couple of pictures.
5070780	5072380	What's the last time you cried?
5072380	5074660	Uh, oh, really, really recently.
5074660	5076500	Like, I cried. I cried in therapy.
5078300	5080780	I'll cry. I cried at Coco.
5080780	5081540	Give a cry happy.
5081540	5083700	I just like to see some beautiful weather or something like that.
5083700	5085700	Oh, I guess Coco is kind of a happy cry, right?
5085700	5088940	You're crying because you're happy for the Mexican people.
5089140	5091980	They're happy they're dead or whatever.
5092020	5093940	Well, I think you missed the point, but yeah.
5093940	5102460	I haven't seen Coco, so don't spoil it for me, but assume he's wrong.
5102900	5106300	No, you're supposed to be happy for the dead Mexican people.
5106300	5110300	It sounds bad when you say it, but it's the truth of the movie
5110300	5113860	is you're crying with happiness for the for the dead Mexican.
5113860	5116220	OK, I want to come out now.
5116220	5118260	I want to. Well, I should have thought of that.
5118260	5121020	I think if those characters were here, they'd say, well, how do you want to do this?
5121020	5123620	Mexican and I'd say, well, you know, you want us to lift the bed for you.
5123620	5125900	There's a very Mexican movie, which also made it good.
5126860	5128500	Rob, you only have a half hour of show left.
5128500	5131140	You can you can tough it out. Yeah, you've got this.
5131580	5134020	So my face is starting to hurt.
5134020	5135780	Oh, that's shingles.
5135780	5138660	You may have. Is it just one side?
5138660	5142420	Well, it's the one I'm resting my weight on.
5142540	5145420	Are you dusting? Are you snorting dust under there?
5145420	5147300	Dusting? Yeah.
5147300	5151140	Let me ask you this, rookie to pro podcasting.
5151300	5152900	How do you how do you find an ending?
5152900	5155540	You know, like what do you what if you get caught in a rut
5155540	5157580	where your show is apparently two hours long?
5157580	5159900	What do you do? You keep making it two hours.
5160060	5163180	I've been I have this fantasy where I keep like I keep like
5163620	5166020	roll it back five minutes. Yeah. Why can't you do that?
5166020	5168980	I don't know. We could do we could do that.
5168980	5171260	I guess the same reason why it became two hours, because I don't know.
5171260	5172860	Well, I don't know what in a vacuum.
5172860	5174900	How do you say the magic words and we could just.
5175500	5178140	Well, that we we couldn't do. That feels awkward.
5178340	5180500	That's not that's literally not possible.
5181340	5183620	I think what we need, well, we don't need it now
5183620	5186860	because we don't you know, pretty soon we'll be in front of an audience again.
5186860	5189700	And we'll do you miss that? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course.
5190900	5193140	You know, so what's the status now?
5193140	5194100	I've been away for a while.
5194100	5195660	What's going on with the audience thing?
5195660	5197580	We're going to get one back.
5197580	5200660	We're going to we're going to be doing a residency at a theater.
5201060	5203100	Is that the one downtown ish? Yeah.
5203100	5205100	Are we fucking? Are we allowed to mention anything?
5205100	5208460	I know. Yeah, I got maybe as I would.
5208580	5211820	We're reversing the trope of the guy under the bed
5211820	5214780	having to hide while the people on top are doing it.
5215740	5217660	There's a guy under my bed doing it.
5220020	5222860	You're going to believe any kids now, let's say,
5222860	5224980	there's monsters under the bed. Yeah.
5224980	5228100	Rob, are you thinking it was a good idea or a bad idea to go under there?
5228460	5231620	He's happy. Oh, he's coming. Hold on.
5232260	5234100	I OK. He's finishing.
5234100	5237780	I think it might be a I don't think it's a good idea.
5238260	5240460	Yeah, this is a great idea.
5240460	5241660	The option ever comes up.
5241660	5243820	Just don't assume that you should.
5243820	5244780	He wants everybody to know.
5244780	5246180	I think you should feel accomplished.
5246180	5248100	You said, I wonder if I can get under the bed.
5248100	5250540	Now he's on. You don't have to wonder anymore.
5250540	5254140	I wanted to come out, but Jeff started sticking that thing in my ass.
5255820	5258980	So so you want to stay there longer so he can keep doing it?
5259780	5262020	No, I guess he wanted to.
5262020	5263500	Yeah, hide under the bed.
5263500	5265700	I don't know him getting a mom vibe here.
5266700	5269700	I'm the New York Squares.
5270700	5272780	You would make a great mom. Thanks, buddy.
5272780	5273940	Well, of course.
5273940	5276780	I think anyone who says they don't want to be a mom would make a great mom.
5277220	5279340	I agree. Do you do you do you do you're saying
5279340	5281580	that you're being sarcastic because that's what everybody says, right?
5281580	5283900	Like we all jump on the women that say they don't want to be
5283900	5288620	not literally jump on it, but they like like we act like they're refusing the call.
5288620	5289460	Mother. Yeah, you would.
5289460	5292260	I do get annoyed when I say I don't want to hold your baby and people.
5292260	5294060	There's like that. That's like a guy thing.
5294060	5297620	I think like like because everybody thinks it's like a trope where like,
5297620	5300100	oh, you're going to hold the baby and then you're going to turn into
5300100	5302420	like a dad that wants a baby.
5302420	5306820	And I don't like that from the end of Jurassic Park
5306820	5309020	when he's got the two sleepy kids on him and Lord.
5309020	5314500	Yeah, like I know it's or John Kuzak in good point blank, gross point blank.
5314740	5317220	Like it's not it's that that's not going to happen all the time.
5317220	5320220	And that's not me saying I hate your baby or I hate babies.
5320220	5321700	They're just like, I don't want to hold your baby.
5321700	5325060	Like just because you need your baby held at this particular time
5325060	5327420	because you want to experience a brief taste of what it's like
5327420	5330220	to be a normal human for a couple of seconds.
5330220	5334540	Like that doesn't that's not going to just sync up with me wanting to hold a baby.
5335740	5338740	I warn people that I'm not good at holding babies
5338740	5341540	and they keep insisting on the third time I run with the baby.
5341540	5344980	Yeah, you know, I just realize if people would just characterize it as what it is,
5344980	5349300	which is a favor, if they would go, would you mind holding this baby?
5349300	5352980	Like, like, like it's like like what you do with a bowling ball full of hornets.
5353020	5358460	You know, like, would you do you mind so I can get a drink so I can retaste my youth?
5359340	5362860	No, I would do that favor as a friend because you've done shit for me.
5363020	5365300	But they're always like, you want to hold them?
5365580	5367380	You want to hold them, don't you?
5367380	5369020	You're doing them the favor. Yeah.
5369020	5370740	You have to be the one thinking.
5370740	5374300	Oh, thanks for giving this chalice of fucking magic.
5375380	5376060	I'm sorry.
5376060	5378620	I know I'm sitting here pretending like I'm a curmudgeon.
5379300	5385940	Yeah, I think Rob took the hymns and now there's a there's a ripping sound
5386740	5388460	as a tendon, I think.
5388460	5393380	I'm actually so old now that I'm it's been eight years
5393380	5394860	since anyone's made me hold a baby.
5394860	5397980	It's not even I'm at a party where there's where there's fertile people
5397980	5402220	wouldn't run it around, you know, like, like all of my friends, kids are in college.
5403580	5405100	Have you ever been given the ultimatum?
5405100	5407340	Have a baby or we're breaking up?
5407340	5410220	Now, Rob, you want me to get the kettle out so we can scoot you along here?
5412180	5414580	Should we all grab one side and just see who's stronger?
5416220	5417580	Cody and I are up in the air.
5417580	5420020	I think, you know, we made a decision like, let's be the couple
5420020	5422620	that doesn't know if they're going to have a kid, you know?
5422780	5424500	And like, we like we like that.
5424500	5426180	It's like, why do you have a favorite color?
5426180	5427780	What does that mean? Like this?
5427780	5429420	What if I say my favorite color is orange?
5429420	5430620	Like, what are the bad legs?
5430620	5433180	The orange is is is slipping.
5433180	5434300	What's your favorite movie?
5434300	5435820	It doesn't make any sense, right? It doesn't.
5435820	5437340	But do you have a favorite color?
5437340	5438980	This metal leg.
5438980	5441020	No, metal bed like is slipping.
5441020	5443100	But of what? A T-shirt?
5443980	5446060	Of a T-shirt. Burgundy. See?
5446060	5448100	Oh, good one.
5448100	5451980	What if Rob is dying and we're just it's gushing my hand?
5452420	5456940	I picture Dan being a kid, though, and then masking the elementary school class.
5456940	5458340	Like, what is your favorite color?
5458340	5459580	I wish. What is it?
5459580	5461860	What is a favorite color? Now everything's that color.
5461860	5464060	I wish I could go back and be that kid.
5464060	5466300	Like, like, like, I think I was that kid in ways
5466300	5468220	that I didn't understand I was being that kid.
5468220	5470220	But I want to go back and taste being that kid
5470220	5472900	and like actually draw a line in the fucking scene and go,
5472900	5475020	fuck you, stop tickling me, you know?
5475020	5478060	You know, that's a thing now, like nonconsensual tickling like you.
5478820	5484460	I'm watching my girlfriend's sister and they're raising their kids
5484460	5486420	and they're like, they're doing all the
5486420	5488020	like those kids have never been hit.
5488020	5491500	They've never been like, like they they they're
5491820	5495060	it's all the tropes that you would roll your eyes at for modern parenting,
5495060	5497740	you know, but they're they're great kids.
5497740	5500060	They're they're totally like happy and healthy.
5500060	5503340	And they like the boy is two years older than a girl.
5503340	5507820	And he like loves her and like hugs her and says, I love my sister and stuff.
5507820	5511420	And they give them a thought process instead of telling them what to do.
5511420	5512980	Yeah, like they engage with them
5512980	5515860	like in a way that I'm like when I first was watching them do it,
5515860	5517820	I was like, don't just fucking
5517820	5520460	don't you know that kid is fucking manipulating you?
5520460	5523900	Like teach him who's the fucking boss, you know, like in the back of my head.
5523900	5526980	I was just like, don't let that piece of shit run your life.
5526980	5529220	It's just you and the kid you lean over. You don't have me.
5531740	5536700	But yeah, you want to have a fun exercise or you stand up real quick.
5537140	5537980	Oh, sure, sure.
5539700	5543300	OK, yeah, we're worried about Rob thrashing under the bed
5543300	5545940	might have caused the bed to because I'm a stable.
5546140	5547980	He seems so resilient.
5547980	5549980	Middle structure like they're
5552060	5553780	are you kidding on IKEA furniture?
5553780	5557500	That would be a fucking crazy way for Rob to have died.
5557500	5561260	It would be very fitting, I think it would be a horrible way for him to die.
5561260	5564380	But it would be the best way for your friend to have died.
5566980	5568740	Like, oh, how'd you how'd your friend die?
5568740	5571780	I crushed him. Oh, I crushed. I crushed him.
5574580	5575660	How are you doing?
5575700	5579900	OK. Hey, Dan, this is it's not really my place to say this, but
5580660	5584900	we had three endings that we passed in answer your question.
5587020	5591420	Yeah, I've never never let a guest make you get out of bed.
5591900	5594460	No, OK. See, this is good.
5595060	5597260	Everything just changed. I wish I knew these tips.
5597260	5599660	Well, I mean, Spencer's he's the game master.
5599660	5600980	He's not really a guest.
5600980	5602660	He's like kind of a permanent resident.
5602660	5604780	I'd like to think of myself as a guest.
5606020	5607780	Because it gives me more clout.
5607780	5609460	I meant the gentleman actually under your bed.
5609460	5612100	But I see what you're saying. Oh, I like to think of Rob as a guest.
5612780	5613900	I don't even know what he is.
5613900	5618020	He's he's the Hamburglar is a ward of the of the podcast.
5618900	5622860	I just started showing up and I felt sorry for me.
5623460	5628300	All right. Well, I think I think the answer to my own question is
5629140	5632340	there's a little bit of format needed so that you know, you know, we used
5632340	5635620	we were playing D&D and we'd know, OK, well, then we're going to end the show.
5636060	5640220	With D&D. But, you know, it's you missed that, Spencer.
5640260	5642020	Those were the days, right? Oh, yeah.
5642020	5645900	I mean, I'm a really structure driven person, so I just crave it.
5645900	5647380	I'm like a vine.
5647380	5648740	I need one of those trellises.
5648740	5650980	Otherwise, I'll just trip everybody.
5651460	5655580	Did you do you ever bring a D&D game that you wrote anyway,
5655580	5657380	even though he says we don't do that anymore?
5657380	5660180	I even though he says we don't do Shadowrun anymore.
5660540	5663940	Yeah, I actually I still bring I get I bring a session
5663940	5668700	for every game we've abandoned and I bring a balder dash.
5669540	5673060	It's good, but it doesn't it doesn't often come up.
5673060	5674620	But I like to be prepared.
5674620	5678300	You're saying episodes into your your NPR
5679220	5682540	remote piece about the permits. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
5682540	5683980	No, I've done all that stuff.
5683980	5685300	We didn't play a single one of those.
5685300	5686740	I think I prepare.
5686740	5688340	Well, we do we do two hours.
5688340	5690980	So I prepare six hours for every show we do.
5691420	5693580	Most of it doesn't matter, but I do.
5693580	5695780	I do commit. Does that bother you at all?
5695780	5698380	Because you do all that and Dan went out and bought some eggs.
5698780	5700740	Yeah, I did buy those.
5700740	5703140	You got the eggs, too.
5703140	5704260	It was part of it.
5704260	5706780	He was like, we're going to need some eggs on the show.
5706780	5709860	No, I love it. I appreciate it.
5710580	5713940	I like not having to do the work that I did. Right.
5713980	5717100	Does anything does anything bother you about the whole setup?
5717100	5720100	You can say no. I think the beds a little loud. Right.
5721140	5725700	It's a bit garish like color wise, or I like muted colors like an inch
5725700	5727940	more underneath.
5727940	5730900	I could have used it to be like three times rickettier.
5731140	5733340	If you go down there and look at the three little posts
5733340	5736340	that are holding up the center of this bed, it's it's not structurally.
5736340	5739580	Yeah, you think a grown man was thrashing around
5739580	5742620	while someone was like laying on it.
5743020	5745180	It looks really shaky.
5745180	5748220	I was really worried that Rob is actually just going to get demolished.
5748220	5751420	Well, yeah, it was very he was warping it pretty intensely
5751420	5753140	while he was under it.
5753140	5755260	Do you guys want to play high low?
5755260	5757860	Oh, wait, wait. That's how do you play that?
5757860	5760260	It's like red and red like green light.
5761460	5763300	Sure. But differ. Yeah.
5763300	5764700	Well, how do you play it?
5764700	5765860	You say is that funny?
5765860	5768180	Because I will not agree to it until I know how to play.
5768180	5770500	First, take your dick out. I'm glad I said.
5770500	5773340	Yeah, this is right. What's the rules? I knew it.
5773580	5777500	The simplest version is you say the high of the day and your low of the day.
5778060	5780660	We expanded a little to say what the lesson is of the low
5780660	5781620	and what you're grateful for.
5781620	5783340	But we can start with just high, low.
5783340	5785580	What's the high of the day? What's the low of the day?
5785580	5787460	That sounds like a show closer. I like that.
5787460	5792100	I think the high of the day for me was Rob being hilarious and under the bed.
5792940	5795140	And what was your low?
5797180	5799580	What was my low?
5799580	5802060	I just been kind of in a.
5802660	5808660	Like I can't turn on the news kind of depression. And so.
5810660	5816420	What watching Twitter freak out about Michelle you know, and all that stuff
5816940	5820260	and feeling the pressure that you have to catch up with it.
5820300	5822700	What is it? Does that mean it's like it's like, oh, come on,
5822700	5826420	like we have a fucking rapey racist fuckface.
5826780	5831540	And that's our fucking issue is that a woman made a funny ass joke
5831740	5834420	that you can't take it.
5834420	5835900	Then we're the bad guys.
5835900	5838340	So yeah, I just got into a mild.
5840340	5842620	The world is full of bullshit
5843820	5845220	spiral today.
5845220	5846780	What do you do when that happens?
5846780	5848860	How do you get out of it?
5848860	5849900	You put on a suit.
5849900	5852100	I took a nap and put a suit on. OK.
5852100	5852820	That's nice.
5852820	5855580	A suit actually kind of makes up for lots of sadness.
5856700	5857580	Spencer things.
5857580	5859180	Yes, he comes in with a five piece suit.
5859180	5860420	Look, oh, rough day.
5860420	5862420	If you ever seem with an 11 piece suit,
5863820	5865420	that means I have face shingles.
5865420	5867180	There's a tie on the back.
5867180	5868660	It's everything that was yours.
5868660	5871300	Let's let's let's let's go down the line.
5871300	5873140	That's it. My my high is being here.
5873140	5874820	It's very exciting. Nice.
5874820	5877500	And the low is for a split second.
5877500	5881620	I thought Rob would die, but then he started thrashing the bed there.
5881620	5883380	I thought we might have committed a horrible crime.
5883380	5886620	Yeah, that is her high was being on this show.
5886620	5888860	And look what you did for the whole show.
5888860	5890020	You caused her low.
5890020	5892660	I caused I caused her low. I'm sorry.
5892660	5893860	That's actually my lowest.
5893860	5897460	I told a rape joke earlier, and I can't tell if it was appropriate or not.
5897460	5898620	But I went for it.
5898620	5900660	It's hard these days.
5900660	5903140	Back in the old days, it was so safe.
5904900	5906620	I made this space not safe.
5906620	5908660	No, no. I get a person to people.
5908660	5910860	It was it was on the show. Don't you remember?
5911980	5913780	You are here and not disgusted at all.
5913780	5916300	Yeah. I'm sorry. That was also my love.
5916300	5918900	Yeah. Keith Malley.
5918900	5922100	I think my high would be being a resident of Harman town for a minute.
5922100	5925420	My low is the poor homeless person that's going to come across his bed
5925420	5928740	and be so excited and then lay in it for a second.
5928740	5932500	And it breaks and he has shingles.
5932500	5934900	That's tough. That's a tough day.
5934900	5937540	That's the day you put on a couple of suits and he went.
5937860	5939740	Yeah. Shrob, high low.
5939740	5943420	My high was having lunch with Kate.
5944500	5947900	We've been we we've been.
5947980	5950020	We watched this this.
5950340	5952660	Have you seen this on Netflix, the chef's table?
5952660	5956900	Have you seen the it's there's like an episode about like how
5956900	5960780	this is how we start got interested in going to Buddhist temple.
5960780	5963340	But there is like this Buddhist woman chef
5963340	5968220	who is like talking about like how to eat and and preparing food.
5968220	5973700	And and the thing that we've been trying lately is eating silence
5974500	5979740	and like taking a bite, putting your spoon or fork down
5979740	5983860	and chewing it and being present and feeling the food in your mouth.
5983860	5987500	And because like usually, usually people are like eating
5987500	5991580	while they're watching TV or checking their email or multitasking or whatever.
5991580	5992340	You're not really.
5992340	5994380	And you're just shoving food in your mouth.
5994380	5996180	You have the cellistine prophecy.
5996180	5998860	What's that? The cellistine prophecy.
5998860	6000660	Say again. Have you read the cellistine?
6000700	6004180	No, I guess no. No, no, no.
6004180	6007380	Well, because they talk about they talk about the prophecy.
6007540	6009260	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6009260	6012860	But it's but it is it is like that is just being very mindful and present.
6013460	6017060	And I know I've found by doing that that
6019020	6022660	the food that I'm eating tastes better and I'm more satisfied.
6022660	6027340	And I've had like this more and it's just it's a it's a great time of the day.
6027340	6029540	Not for the waiter. That is a pain in the ass.
6030260	6032500	Well, we made our own food at home.
6032500	6036340	But but then the blue apron, they provide you the ingredients.
6038900	6043620	And the the the low point I'm having, the chicken fried
6043620	6046740	cuckoo seed with raisin bread, barnasies.
6048580	6052060	My low low point is is Dan interrupting me.
6054700	6056500	Dan, hi, low.
6056500	6059140	My low point was saying goodbye to Cody for it.
6059140	6062300	She had to go and I knew I'd come to the show and like she can't stay over
6062300	6065260	tonight because she's got work in the morning and and, you know,
6065300	6066660	who knows if we'll see each other tomorrow.
6066660	6069380	So it was like, you know, at the end of a weekend,
6069740	6073100	me having to come do this show, no offense to the people that enjoy it.
6073100	6077180	Although I don't understand your enjoyment
6078420	6082260	for the last few episodes, but I
6083260	6086940	is just like traditionally Sunday nights before I come here are kind of a low
6086940	6091540	because I'm like weekends over and like no more sleepovers with Cody.
6092100	6095140	And and we kind of wasted our time together.
6095140	6097740	Sometimes I feel like we watched that.
6097740	6101860	We tried to watch that Hugh Jackman P.T. Barnum musical.
6102100	6104700	And I was like, Wolverine, Hugh Jackman playing Barnum.
6104900	6107340	Yeah, it's it was in that play when I was a kid.
6107700	6110580	And my high for real was just now
6110580	6114460	when you guys started with your lows, who my high was realizing that
6114460	6117900	because I went off a Twitter when I got the shingles, it was like, OK, I'm not
6117900	6122060	going to think like this Michelle Wolf thing.
6122100	6124220	I don't even know who that is. What happened?
6124220	6128060	I know it sounds like totally aggravating and upsetting.
6128060	6129660	And I totally have no clue about it.
6129660	6132020	And it's not like not knowing about the polar ice caps.
6132020	6134660	It's like sounds like it's not knowing about some shit that's like
6135180	6136940	just kind of that you can avoid.
6136940	6140620	Yeah, like it sounds like I wasn't going to help that subject.
6141020	6142860	It was only going to make me upset, you know.
6142860	6146060	So I kind of feel like dodged a bullet kind of high.
6146380	6146980	Get out of that.
6146980	6150420	Like, wow, that encourages me to stay off of Twitter.
6150420	6152700	People who invented the word snowflakes got really hurt
6152700	6156380	by a woman doing a joke about makeup and everybody really went off the fucking
6156380	6160380	hand. We're going to make you know anyway what this world's like.
6161180	6164060	Now, it's kind of like, I mean, I don't mind hearing all about the bullet.
6164060	6166460	I dodged. Let's say like, oh, yeah, it was like
6166620	6170820	twenty two with, you know, yeah, I mean, also that can't really be my low.
6170820	6174780	I think that was just my low is being in a place where that was affecting me.
6174780	6177340	Like, it's like there's something lower than that
6177340	6180860	that makes that even a thing that is on my radar.
6180940	6186180	Well, my new low is is is this having to be witness to this low backpedaling.
6186980	6190580	I don't know. I don't like this low like finding out that lows are changing.
6190580	6194220	My low that my low is this awful horrible fake ficus is behind you.
6194220	6195740	This is the stricken.
6195740	6198700	I thought you were going to say like this, this fern on your forehead,
6198700	6200860	like like it's going to start like shingle shaming me.
6200980	6203180	I like that. I like that your low isn't even your shingle.
6203180	6204420	So you have other lows.
6204420	6205860	Oh, yeah. You know what? You're right.
6205860	6209100	I had shingles and it should either be that my high is that,
6209100	6212180	oh, they're kind of like done, you know, like I had a kind of a pain free day.
6212220	6216060	I might be imagining this, but they look less red than when the show started.
6216260	6219020	I think you're actually healing as we watch them passing them off.
6219020	6221900	The irony is that the rest of your face is catching up.
6221900	6223940	See them get scabbier like that.
6223940	6224940	That's good news.
6224940	6227300	Like when you the scabbier, they get just don't pick them.
6227300	6230780	You get a scar. Yeah, I wasn't going to pick the fucking herpes scabs.
6231380	6232700	Just just don't pick it.
6232700	6234020	Just don't worry him to death.
6234020	6238980	You got to if you start picking at it, you're going to get a scar free.
6238980	6240180	And it's not on my knee.
6240180	6241980	It's a fucking happy scar on my head.
6241980	6243420	It hurts to write.
6243420	6244780	Just don't let him do it.
6244780	6247100	Damn, you're not you're not concerned that the mortgage has been sleeping.
6247140	6250340	He has every right to sleep.
6250340	6252260	It's a boring works hard.
6252260	6253620	What do you want to work to do?
6253620	6254580	He's taking it in.
6254580	6255860	Keep him in the bed.
6255860	6257260	No. Oh, yeah, sure.
6257260	6258820	OK, weren't you going to climb in?
6258820	6260100	Crawling the bed.
6260100	6261500	Get some get some of that Harman Jingle.
6261500	6262860	Rob's kind of in it.
6262860	6266700	If you if you if you share a if you share a good high low in the bed,
6266700	6270900	you can you can close the show and let's go underneath the bed again.
6270900	6273420	Church, you had a church in here from Spencer.
6274420	6276820	Well, Spencer, high low.
6276820	6279860	Oh, why is it look like I could do fucking Dungeons and Dragons again?
6279860	6283460	I'm high as a kite, my man.
6283460	6285620	And my low is
6287220	6289900	just the rest of existence, I think.
6290740	6292700	Fair enough. Hmm.
6292700	6294060	It's rough.
6294060	6296620	You got high, low roaded, Dan.
6296620	6299420	Yeah, Dan, fucking stick it to that.
6299420	6301980	The only problem I have with high low is that you is it.
6301980	6304220	You no matter what, you're ending on a low.
6304220	6305660	There's no way it's going to close the show.
6305660	6306740	Yeah, we should have.
6306740	6310180	We had it like what did you learn from low and what are you grateful for?
6310180	6311380	Oh, right, right.
6311380	6313340	I mean, we should have played you guys go last
6313340	6316940	because you probably use it to close your shows and are good at making them good.
6317820	6320100	And I'm a piece. What are you what are you doing?
6320100	6321940	You're like a fucking cat.
6321940	6326020	God, stop it.
6326220	6327900	He fucking read it was so sad.
6327900	6332140	He like it's I got I got a tweet in my timeline back when I was on Twitter.
6332140	6335020	And it said there was it was a guy saying like,
6335180	6337620	I think you should bring Rob to Boston.
6337860	6342140	And it said above it, Rob Shrob retweeted because that's why I was in my timeline.
6342300	6344700	And then you follow the island.
6344700	6346180	I was like three retweets.
6346180	6347820	And you know that one of them is Rob.
6347820	6351820	Yeah. By the way, I like all his talking about not being on Twitter anymore.
6351820	6353260	That was yesterday, Dan.
6353260	6354460	It was like two days ago.
6354460	6356300	That's a long time for a Twitter junkie.
6356300	6359620	That's like, you know, baby steps one day at a time.
6359740	6360700	Did you get your chip?
6360700	6364420	Yeah, I deserve a big, big old chip for the eight is not knowing who
6364420	6365980	Michelle Wolf is.
6365980	6368020	Don't even know the closing song.
6368020	6371100	Dan Harmon should.
6371100	6373140	Oh, you got some music for sex.
6375580	6376540	Or maybe not.
6383540	6386300	Yo, tell me a story, Uncle Ricky.
6386300	6389220	It's about time to learn what we learn.
6389460	6390820	What do you think you talk about?
6390820	6393460	How we burn the herpes out our head.
6393780	6395780	Don't let them get inside you.
6395780	6397460	You've got to go wide.
6397460	6400300	You've got to keep on rapping at the end of the show.
6400300	6402940	Don't take a crap in to do your butt.
6403260	6404260	Get it outside.
6404260	6406180	So what? Put it in the toilet.

6429460	6433820	Just escaping, losing, dabbing my brain.

6539700	6540700	Human race.
6540700	6542700	We're just shingles on the earth.
6542700	6543700	Fill it out.
6543700	6544700	Fill it to earth.
6544700	6545700	I am happy.

6576700	6577700	I think everyone's a winner.
6577700	6580700	I don't think it was anything like Red Light, Green Light.
6580700	6581700	No.
6581700	6582700	No.
6582700	6583700	I don't know.
6583700	6584700	That's a good one.
6584700	6585700	Sorry to disappoint.
6585700	6588700	It didn't nowhere even compare to Red Light, Green Light.
6588700	6589700	It wasn't even close.

6615700	6618700	You know, I don't have to go to Boston if you don't want my game.
6618700	6620700	Sarah, everybody back there doing cool things.
6620700	6625700	If you don't want me to go to Boston, I don't have to go.
6625700	6626700	Thank you to Starburn.

6633700	6637700	I think this is like the, what is it when you go to the website and watch Bill Maher
6637700	6640700	talk more about corn syrup and animals?

6653700	6656700	22nd of June, the Wilbur Theater, which is a fantastic theater if you've not
6656700	6657700	been there.
6657700	6660700	It's one of my favorite venues in the in the continental U.S.
6660700	6662700	It's a good, good time.
6662700	6665700	We'll go get wicked retarded together and probably have some lobster and
6665700	6667700	whatever the fuck.
6667700	6670700	If they have vegan lobster, I'll have a vegan lobster.
6670700	6671700	They'll be wicked retarded.
6671700	6675700	But the retardedness will be we can guarantee your wickedness and the
6675700	6676700	retardedness.
6676700	6677700	Or your money back.
6677700	6678700	Or your money back.
6678700	6681700	Rob's tribe will be there by his own self proclamation.

6692700	6695700	The Cradle of Aviation Museum.
6695700	6697700	That's like through a convention or something.
6697700	6698700	The 23rd of June.
6698700	6701700	You have to like bring the convention or get tickets to that.
6701700	6702700	Long Island.
6702700	6703700	Long Island.
6703700	6704700	You have family in Long Island?
6704700	6705700	My family in Long Island?
6705700	6706700	They're all in Jersey.
6706700	6707700	My brother lives there now.
6707700	6708700	Where in Long Island?
6708700	6709700	Oh, it's terrible.
6709700	6710700	It's so far out.
6710700	6711700	And the humidity?
6711700	6712700	Oh, I hate it.
6712700	6714700	You got to travel by little.
6714700	6716700	Why do they call it Long Island?
6716700	6718700	But there's a place with an egg salad that is just a hook.
6718700	6719700	Oh, that's always egg salad.
6719700	6720700	So it's kind of nice.
6720700	6721700	Yes.
6721700	6722700	No.
6722700	6723700	I plot so nice.
6723700	6724700	Compared to one.
6724700	6726700	Why is it Long Island?
6726700	6727700	It's too long.
6727700	6728700	It's Long Island.
6731700	6732700	Anyway, you go in there.
6732700	6733700	That's fantastic.

6744700	6746700	Can you believe this is a show?
6746700	6748700	This is a show.
6748700	6749700	That's all right.
6749700	6753700	Can you believe the definition of show who has changed this much?
6753700	6757700	It's almost like putting a bet on stage didn't lend itself to high energy.
6757700	6762700	Go to the Harmontown Instagram to see some choice boomerangs that Church did of
6762700	6766700	Jeff sodomizing Rob with a foreign object.
6766700	6772700	Also, go to this Ficus's GoFundMe page so we can get this moisture before this attendant dies.
6772700	6774700	Feed me Seymour.
6775700	6776700	All right.
6776700	6777700	Drive fast.
6777700	6778700	Take chances.
6778700	6779700	We bid you a fond farewell.
6780700	6781700	Zach Pumperham.
6782700	6783700	I've got a headache.
6783700	6784700	Thanks for having us.
6793700	6794700	Did you get any of that?
6795700	6796700	It's a good show.
