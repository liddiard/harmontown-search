204200	210320	agent yes I get 10% of your laughter if
210320	212200	you represent the joke you're like
212200	213800	making calls listen this there's a joke
213800	217480	over here what was his angle what was he
217480	219800	trying to he was coming clean about the
219800	225720	fact that he was it I think part of me
225720	227480	is like I won't click on any of the shit
227480	229280	because it feels it's like like my
229280	231200	general sort of like the internet's
231200	233520	awful and all this stuff but as far as
233520	235000	I but I also don't think it's one of
235000	236200	those stories like whoa you gotta do
236200	239120	your research I would I believe that he
239120	241000	was probably doing an interview I think
241000	244160	he kind of like I've done a lot of
244160	246440	interviews and I and when you're on a
246440	248600	roll maybe you've taken an extra
248600	250240	milligram of Adderall and maybe you're at
250240	251680	Comic Con and you're like someone's like
251680	253520	pumping you up being like yeah but
253520	256360	seriously why is Rick and Morty so
256360	258160	genius and you're like this person I
258160	259880	can't do no wrong like I want to try to
259880	263120	explain myself and and like I think he
263720	266360	he sidled into a confession about how
266360	270760	crazy he was 40 years ago 40 years ago
270760	274840	and this is all of our mistake is twice
274840	276440	the median age of the people that
276440	278440	control the planet so none of them are
278440	280920	ever gonna go oh well I get it they're
280920	283480	like this is my this is my realization
283480	284760	this is both my terror and my
284760	287560	resignation it's like if you lived your
287560	292000	life on the internet as I have you are
292000	294160	now you have laid down a paper trail
294160	297160	like a landscape of you being a
297160	301360	terrible person from the age of 0 to 46
301360	305360	now today's 10 year old is who's born on
305360	306720	the internet and I say this out of
306720	309120	sympathy to today's children because
309120	311320	they have to have 35 Instagram accounts
311320	312480	so that their parents can't watch them
312480	315360	go through puberty I don't even I can't
315360	316920	imagine what it's like to be 20 today
316920	320400	it being but but but also the problem is
320400	322680	like they're 20 and they're going like
322680	326920	what 40 years ago you were racist that's
326920	329360	crazy like like but it's like well
329360	331480	everything 40 years ago is crazy to you
331480	336280	you it was you weren't born it's telling
336280	339440	a story about like how fucked up he was
339440	345000	so long ago I look I Dan Harmon goes to
345000	348280	bat for Liam Neeson I fuck off I I I I
349000	352760	I want us to stop destroying each other
352760	354640	I want I want the cloud that we're
354640	356920	becoming I don't think any individual is
356920	359000	becoming a worse person how does he know
359000	363000	to not tell that story like I like if
363000	364680	that happened that's that's the biggest
364680	366560	tragedy of all the answer is because he
366560	369440	felt comfortable and he wanted to
369440	372480	confess what do you want to confess Dan
372480	375320	that would be great wouldn't it like so
375320	376560	it's like am I supposed to stand here
376560	379040	and say from now on forget it like I
379040	381200	don't realize I every night I go to bed
381200	383720	I'm like what am I doing this for like
383720	386040	it goes up and down the answer is like
386040	388040	to keep a gun out of my mouth because if
388040	390200	I don't talk my mind into a microphone
390200	392480	it bounces around inside my skull and
392480	394440	it's gonna get worse and worse and worse
394440	396440	am I doing this for me am I doing this
396440	397880	for other people I don't even know
397880	400680	anymore I know that the day I quit it
400680	403480	will be I can't quit tomorrow because
403480	406400	it'll be Dan Harmon quits podcast in
406400	411080	dust up over Liam Neeson story I have to
411080	415120	now wait until it's gas prices now now
415120	417200	we have one more year of me on these edge
417200	420480	yeah I mean it's I I'm still waiting
420480	426040	till it's I look man I I don't think that
426040	427840	there's anything that any individual can
427840	429600	do because I think that every individual
429600	431840	is actually a good person I the thing
431840	433080	that I'm going through right now I tell
433080	434760	my therapist all the time I'm like I hate
434760	438200	everyone and except for anyone I meet I
438200	441080	I hate but none of us are meeting each
441080	444160	other I just like I hate what we've
444160	447800	become I hate the cloud I hate this
447800	450360	collective behavior and I said it before
450360	452680	like when the when the weatherman was you
452680	454760	know he accidentally said the the wrong
454760	457720	word and stuff like I express the
457720	460480	sentiment of like out of sympathy for
460480	462400	actually the people that get outraged
462400	465000	all of whom I believe I give them
465000	467920	credit as an American like I bet they
467920	469640	don't want the power over whether
469640	471720	someone gets fired if you and I are on a
471720	473800	smoke break out in the sidewalk what we
473800	476160	want to do is talk shit about Liam Neeson
476160	479240	we want to like but and we don't want a
479240	481800	fucking drone to monitor what we say and
481800	484200	then take it to his publicist and affect
484200	487080	his career we want to be able to with
487080	489360	all of our primate hearts go like that
489360	490960	was fucked up I didn't like that I don't
490960	492520	like what he said that's the thing
492520	493800	about this is like we want to be able
493800	495080	to wake up the next day and go yeah I
495080	496320	was talking a lot of shit I don't know
496320	497600	what the fuck I'm talking about I need
497600	500160	to read about it yeah it's like that's
500160	503160	true that's a human trait if you level
503160	505000	the playing field though you can get
505000	507120	away with whatever you want what's it
507120	509240	what do you mean I mean what makes it
509240	511520	difficult is that he spoke about a group
511520	513280	of people who were disenfranchised but
513280	515640	if you lift all the boats with the old
515640	518120	tide then you can talk shit about every
518120	520360	boat I still don't know what you mean I
521360	526560	know I'm not supposed to I want I want
526560	528360	I want to know I want to know literally
528360	530600	it's like I love a good black joke if
530600	532840	it's super funny because the super funny
532840	534720	has lifted the tide because you are a
534720	536680	craftsman who has made a wonderful joke
536680	539160	even at my own expense something that I
539160	541680	love to laugh at myself right that's
541680	544400	when we're cool we're not cool if I'm
544400	546880	broke as fuck and you're pointing at me
546880	549480	as you make the joke so what we want is
549480	550760	a world where I can talk shit about
550760	553160	women and Jews and gays because women and
553160	554800	Jews and gays are doing so fucking well
554800	557480	that even they're like I'm a little weird
557480	561400	right but how does that do you that I
561400	564160	mean like when mr. Neeson was like like
564160	565720	making this confession he was saying
565720	569880	like 40 years ago bastard he so didn't
569880	572200	want it was that phrase for sure my
572200	574920	fucking it was alliterative and it was
574920	576880	like clickable and it was like I wish
576880	578720	you would say my name with bastard
578720	581360	behind it to my face now if you say
581360	583160	black in front of that you kind of saying
583160	585600	my name because I'd like to go as black
585600	588640	brandon some days black brandon Oh black
588640	596800	I'm a pirate it got a brand new suit on
596800	600000	black and brown but that's the game the
600000	601880	game is if you lift everybody up you can
601880	603800	do whatever fuck you yeah joke joke
603800	605720	should always be funny and if you're
605720	607800	gonna tell a racial joke that the only
607800	610840	rule is it has to be they can't you
610840	612520	can't lower the status of the of the
612520	615840	target if the if it's funny that the
615840	617880	person's black or Jewish or a woman or
617880	620760	whatever and they still win that's a
620760	622440	funny joke I'm assuming we're supplant
622440	625160	we're using the joke thing as a template
625160	626640	because like what we understand is jokes
626640	628440	and like we know that he wasn't making a
628440	632040	joke right it was bastard but he was it
632040	635040	does it does apply like a rubbing from
635040	636840	joke to confession because in his
636840	640600	confession he's still he didn't lift up
640600	645440	while he kind of if you said like like
645440	646880	dehumanizing for instance like like
646880	649560	there's a joke I made on TV once that
649560	652320	was the aired and it was a funny joke at
652320	654280	the time if I could go back in time I
654280	656880	would erase that from memory because it
656880	658480	was not a joke you have one of those
658480	661560	aren't you adorable no I mean I mean I'm
661560	663280	thinking of one in particular okay and
663400	666880	and it was funny at the time if I told
666880	669920	that joke today I think it would it
669920	672240	would be horrible and also I'm sad that
672240	675800	I said it once a long time ago and like
675800	677880	could we all retract a thousand things
677880	680920	that we said absolutely I think that's
680920	683320	how everybody I mean I maybe I'm unique
683320	685440	in that I like you know I've I've kind
685440	688120	of like I've aerosol myself from the age
688120	690240	of 23 going look look at me look at me
690240	691840	look at me every shit I take every
691840	694120	thought I think and so every breath you
694120	698040	take I think all darkness and all of the
698040	699680	time and all what I could get away with
699680	701600	at the time it's so much misogyny so
701600	703200	much racism so much so much
703200	706800	unfashionable thought in a world where
706800	710080	it's moving so quickly like I I am
710080	712600	absolutely biased I have an agenda when
712600	714880	I call for forgiveness like we've lost
714880	716640	our shame on the internet which is a
716640	719520	good thing because so much shame needed
719520	721360	to be lost it was being used to bring
721360	723560	hold so many people back but we've also
723560	725680	lost our grace maybe we've lost our
725680	729360	forgiveness we we we we I mean we are
729360	731960	just recreationally and collectively
731960	734640	hurting each other it's not a there's no
734640	736840	call to action because I don't think you
736840	738440	or you or you or you or you any
738440	739920	individual I don't think anyone's
739920	743360	actually becoming a bad person I think
743360	746560	that we're evolving into a collective
746560	749400	organism that is doing some terrible
749400	751280	things if they've all chosen a life
751280	752920	where we all want everyone to hear us
752920	756080	they have to hear us be our worst at all
756080	759320	times too and then we have to learn to
759320	763840	shut up like like we're asking for
763840	766200	followers and we're happy every time we
766200	768120	get more followers but we're bummed out
768120	770720	every time everybody heard us fart or
770720	772600	burp or say something like that we
772600	774080	should have thought twice before we said
774080	776360	do you recall how did you see the real
776360	778440	clear it's not the 40 years ago that he
778440	780040	was racist it was the current day use
780040	782160	of bastard so one of the things in all
782160	784240	speeches okay we don't mind if you say
784240	787440	black hero black big dick don't say
787440	789440	black bad parent don't say black bad
789440	792120	bad don't don't do that so with him had
792120	793680	he not said bastard if you said black
793680	795760	dudes would have been on his okay well
795760	796920	that's getting really specific because
796920	799800	maybe you did you see I the super
799800	802240	specific like the way he because I'm
802240	804240	imagining it again I'm refusing to click
804240	805720	and now I'm and yet I'm going like
805720	807680	everyone let's just love each other but
807680	812120	like he but he surely was characterizing
812120	814360	himself as an unreliable narrator no he
814360	816320	wasn't saying that word you're saying
816320	818280	just like come on if you don't know how
818280	820120	to navigate those waters in general yeah
820120	823120	because you say Adderall comic-con I say
823120	826200	too many interviews tired telling
826200	828280	stories getting too casual and he was
828280	830840	just like after my friend got raped I
830840	832640	went out and I wanted to kill the first
832640	834360	black bastard that I saw and I went
834360	837000	looking for one is the problem that's
837000	839120	like problem is that something happened
839120	841080	to someone you knew and it caused you
841080	843400	to be predatory when the reality is if
843400	846760	that were true I clean this theater out
846760	850520	except for Greg
850520	855960	that's really interesting like you thought
855960	859760	that you think like he let down that's
859760	861720	what I think happened his garden was like
861720	864960	almost humble bragging about it like he
864960	867560	was asked how he got into character
867560	870560	interesting really interesting I want to
870560	871840	tell you one thing we're gonna bring our
871840	873240	guest out he's been waiting too long and
873240	875800	and and the ladies and gentlemen Liam
875800	882480	Neeson the you do a good Liam Neeson
882480	884200	impression do you want to apologize for
884200	886280	it now there's no we're not doing that
886280	888880	joke it's not it won't it won't help
888880	892400	anybody that joke is obvious lately yeah
892400	894200	I get it they're biological killing
894200	898920	machines it's not we're not connecting
898920	902960	those dots but you just did it I I'm
902960	904080	gonna I'm gonna tell you in advance
904080	905680	until the end of my career which is
905680	907840	obviously gonna be shortly given that it
907840	909120	goes back to shit that you've already
909120	913000	done I I'm gonna continue to with
913000	917120	absolutely no mistake that I am in the
917120	921000	kind of like that it's not the it's not
921000	922560	the way to win a popularity contest like
922560	924000	I'm gonna go with my heart I'm gonna
924000	927200	continue to side with the person the
927200	931040	individual who is it was currently at
931040	932880	that point walking the plank I don't
932880	935920	care how bad I'm not I figure if they're
935920	938040	out on the plank like I just want to
938040	940200	feel bad for them like I don't care what
940200	943280	they've done I I don't I think that may
943280	944760	be a lot of projection on my part when
944760	947880	I'm just like I I spent so much time
947880	950080	like I just feel like I've always been
950080	954120	that guy and I I didn't get this far to
954120	956240	like I don't want I don't want to like
956240	959440	like poke people off of that plank I if
959440	960720	they're if they're walking it for a
960720	962800	reason then they're walking off of it
962800	967560	but anyways I I you know like like I
967560	969480	wanted to say one one thing to you sure
969480	973360	you before we bring our guest out
973360	976560	because I was like Spencer dropped out
976560	979160	and and I'm so sorry God love Spencer
979160	981160	everybody I was I was thinking about the
981160	982760	Liam Neeson thing was putting on my me
982760	984480	undies which are three times softer than
984480	987040	cotton and I was having this like
987040	989040	internal monologue in my head I started
989040	990200	thinking about the Michael Richards
990200	994360	thing and the the weird turning point in
994360	996360	the Michael Richards thing for me and I'm
996360	998840	I swear I'm not being hyperbolic about
998840	1002080	the personalization of this I remember
1002080	1004280	distinctly because this podcast is so
1004280	1006920	goddamn old I remember carrying the
1006920	1009200	Michael Richards thing into Harman town
1009200	1011360	at Melt Town and I remember talking to
1011360	1014320	you and Demorge about it like like like
1014320	1015840	talking about it in the green room and
1015840	1019160	both of you guys like my epiphany was
1019160	1020800	like because I was coming and going can
1020800	1023840	you fucking believe this and the two of
1023840	1027280	you basically going like yeah in a way
1027280	1029120	that was like yeah that's the world we
1029120	1032160	live in and it flipped my magnetic poles
1032160	1034520	because I it was like that's important
1034520	1036720	that's why I bring this shit up too
1036720	1038360	because I'm like I'm like what is your
1038360	1039760	hot take do you remember clicking on
1039760	1041440	this Liam Neeson thing and like help me
1041440	1043840	parse it because as a middle-aged white
1043840	1045920	guy I'm gonna be like they're trying to
1045920	1049280	take our rights away I mean last real
1049280	1050560	quick thing is that remember that he
1050560	1054320	kisses Viola Davis so hard in that movie
1054320	1055680	recently I can't remember what the name of
1055680	1057880	it is and and there is this there is
1057880	1059440	this thing that black celebrities are
1059440	1061120	saying which is you know he can't be
1061120	1063160	racist because he is very intimate with
1063160	1065360	Viola Davis in this movie so I do think
1065360	1067040	that that was way back in the day and
1067040	1068440	that he does work on himself and that he
1068440	1070560	probably isn't racist it's just he
1070560	1071840	doesn't know how to tell a story to the
1071840	1073880	press I well okay one more thing and
1073880	1076680	then we'll bring our guest out sure
1076680	1079560	racism is it it's a fucking like it's
1079560	1082920	not it's not a blood type it's a it's a
1082920	1084760	phenomenon right it's like it's not
1084760	1087120	that phenomenal it's like it's like it's
1087120	1090640	like influenza you can't eradicate it by
1090640	1093120	finding people with it and burning them
1093120	1096960	you you you maybe could state a purpose
1096960	1098280	you can stay a mission statement I'm
1098280	1100080	against influenza it goes back your nose
1100080	1102840	is so running I'm gonna kill you but if
1102840	1104920	you genuinely are against the principle
1104920	1106600	you should accept that it's fucking
1106600	1109320	everywhere just rise the boats if we all
1109320	1110880	do that part then we don't have to worry
1110880	1113160	about shit we need to do to prepare for
1113160	1115160	it to deal with it starting with you
1115160	1120000	just got a reason I mean I like this I
1120000	1121960	like racism is a spectrum it's like it's
1121960	1124440	like a it's a sociological phenomenon it
1124440	1127160	happens because it'll happen until the
1127160	1130040	day race stops that you're severely
1130040	1131920	underestimating the people that it
1131920	1134320	affects I but let's bring out that guy I
1134320	1135840	thought okay let's bring up let's bring
1135840	1137120	out our guest and get and get and get
1137120	1140080	deeper and either more or less podcast
1140080	1143320	worthy I don't know he's our new friend
1143320	1144800	he's he's he's he's soaring up the
1144800	1148000	charts he's currently resided in Portland
1148000	1152880	but if if ice has it their way he'll he
1152880	1154480	won't be in Portland for much longer
1154480	1167920	please welcome my haunted El Shiki
1167920	1180560	yeah it is working yeah we're good all
1180560	1183080	right you're from Libya yeah Benghazi
1183080	1185520	yeah which until I researched you this
1185520	1187440	morning yeah I thought Benghazi was like
1187440	1189120	a made-up word we used to hate Hillary
1189120	1192120	Clinton I wish it was it's actually a
1192120	1194800	city and it is it is a city in Libya it's
1194800	1197680	where I lived is sometimes feel made up
1198400	1201080	yeah I want to start there because I
1201080	1202200	like like like you're like the
1202200	1204800	immigration equivalent of like I'm star
1204800	1206120	struck because I don't think I've ever
1206120	1209800	known someone that had asylum yeah for
1209800	1211600	all the talk we do about asylum yeah
1211600	1214120	and I want to talk so much about that
1214120	1217000	but like tracing it from but first let's
1217000	1220120	I just want to picture because here
1220120	1222800	you're growing up in part of a gigantic
1222800	1227000	blind spot for me what childhood in
1227000	1228920	Libya you could be comedic tragic sad
1228920	1231520	whatever I know like oh I mean I mean
1231520	1233520	honestly this is like a funny question
1233520	1234520	you're asking because like a lot of
1234520	1237200	people like when they imagine my child
1237200	1239160	in Libya they always go to like a some
1239160	1242800	like a war zone totally I'm afraid to
1242800	1243920	tell you what I would picture but you
1243920	1245880	can imagine oh no I'll tell you the
1245880	1247240	picture the picture is like me being a
1247240	1249800	child soldier you know just being like
1249800	1251960	I'm gonna send my mom you know what's
1251960	1253600	like those backgrounds where the road is
1253600	1255400	the same color as the building exactly
1255400	1257880	exactly yeah you can't tell yeah no I
1257880	1259600	mean my childhood was like very chill
1259600	1262840	like I I what did the neighborhood look
1262840	1264600	like if it didn't look like that like
1264600	1266200	what my fucking first world like
1266200	1268120	xenophobic images what does it look like
1268120	1271960	like the Munster's neighborhood does it
1271960	1273360	look like the cleavers I don't know what
1273360	1275640	reference to draw I honestly like I look
1275640	1276800	around the land there's like some
1276800	1278600	houses that we had that looked like the
1278600	1281760	same I mean the structure was like more
1281760	1283880	like it was kind of different because
1284000	1286800	like the houses were we don't have like
1286800	1289320	houses like built I don't know how to
1289320	1290760	describe it like the material here that
1290760	1292720	people use it's more like cement they're
1292720	1295320	like kind of like very like this is how
1295320	1296640	I would describe it like you know like
1296640	1299160	when when I was when I was growing up
1299160	1300720	like when I see like someone gets angry
1300720	1302480	on TV they punch a wall and they get
1302480	1304400	through it the Libya you can't do that
1304400	1307280	yeah you punch a wall that's it you're
1307280	1311720	dead yeah it's like cement block kind
1311720	1314200	of exactly yeah so that's a lot of it
1314200	1315880	there are a lot of physical yeah my
1315880	1317600	house growing up and then there would be
1317600	1321320	these dents where you found a stud yeah
1321320	1323200	and that's why people like assume they
1323200	1324800	were super angry like even you can't
1324800	1326360	even punch a wall there like so where
1326360	1329960	you start a war that's what you do when
1329960	1333520	did you leave Libya I I left Libya in
1333520	1336880	2014 so I was 23 when I left okay yeah
1336880	1340040	you came straight to LA or no Portland
1340760	1343040	yeah yeah so initially I came like on an
1343040	1345080	exchange program it was supposed to be
1345080	1347360	for six weeks this is what yes this is
1347360	1349520	like nightmare fuel for me yeah I'm gonna
1349520	1351000	use my eye statements I'm not gonna say
1351000	1352600	for white people yeah night from a
1352600	1355800	nightmare fuel for me yeah you were a
1355800	1359760	special kid smart bright you're like I'm
1359760	1361920	assuming I'm like identifying with you
1361920	1365080	like you're 14 you're in Benghazi you're
1365080	1366720	like people are probably coming up to
1366720	1368680	you and going like hey you're funny like
1368680	1371760	like talk and talk and you become you
1371760	1374000	become an exchange student while you're
1374000	1379320	here here being America yeah you are you
1379320	1381400	getting text your emails this is the
1381400	1383960	story leading to your quest yeah oh yeah
1383960	1386520	Facebook messages from yeah from my
1386520	1390000	family yeah saying yeah so I mean like
1390000	1393440	when I moved here I was 23 I and the
1393440	1394920	program was like six weeks that's the
1394920	1396720	whole program that was it was important
1396720	1398640	state university and after the program
1398640	1401600	was done I was supposed to to go back to
1401600	1403080	Libya that's that was the whole plan
1403080	1405560	like I didn't even pack enough for like
1405560	1408840	staying a year or so and then I was like
1408840	1410480	getting like messages from my family and
1410480	1413280	stuff we're like hey to give you some
1413280	1415080	background like back home when the when
1415080	1417160	the war started like the revolution the
1417160	1421400	Arab Spring they started in 2011 like
1421400	1423600	the countries are like we like the like
1423600	1425240	Libyans took down the government there
1425240	1427560	was like no government anymore and it
1427560	1429400	was like kind of like everything was
1429400	1431320	like very mixed up and was and I used to
1431320	1433240	work as a as an interpreter this is what
1433240	1435520	I did and I used to take like mostly
1435520	1436720	like journalists and stuff I used to
1436720	1439320	take him to the front lines this is when
1439320	1442440	you were a kid I was yeah I was 20 or so
1442440	1445720	and you had such a facility yeah any
1445720	1449480	like like I don't want to derail us yeah
1449480	1451760	this asylum story but also that's a
1451760	1453520	different fascinating story like your
1453520	1456200	biopic I don't understand any polyglot
1456200	1457720	like I don't understand how anybody
1457720	1460320	speaks multiple languages but to be 20
1460320	1463440	yeah how do you let's just go ahead and
1463440	1465400	derail and talk about that job yeah
1465400	1467280	that happened yeah I mean what I mean
1467280	1469200	this was never a job like I was like oh
1469200	1470840	this is what I want to do because the
1470840	1472320	war started out of nowhere just like
1472320	1473560	suddenly out of the Senate it probably
1473560	1474880	doesn't pay well and it sounds like
1474880	1478880	something that may I didn't get paid a
1478880	1481000	single dollar for it but you skip but
1481000	1484360	you skimmed and someone came to you a
1484360	1487320	little bit was that you skim skim is
1487320	1490560	like a finder's fee like people you
1490560	1492240	interpret for somebody and then they go
1492240	1493880	they tip you and then you're like I'm
1493880	1495000	supposed to share this with the other
1495000	1497280	interpreters but I was dumb enough to be
1497280	1499120	like I'm doing this for my country you
1499120	1501120	know and now I'm like I should have got
1501120	1504280	a money for this shit but can you so
1504280	1506840	like like like take me to the moment
1506840	1511800	when who is the harbinger of this gig
1511800	1514600	you are like the moment where you go
1514600	1517800	from regular guy with no troubles to
1517800	1520440	somewhat to being an interpreter yeah so
1520440	1522120	I used to work in a school that thought
1522120	1523760	English is a second language so the
1523760	1528320	approach that second yeah fuck the
1528320	1532160	world I'm sorry I don't know I dumb
1532160	1534960	second second to Arabic Arabic is better
1535080	1537680	fine fine it looks more beautiful when
1537680	1539680	in Rome I guess yeah that's true yeah
1539680	1542120	with a loop yeah I don't run front just
1542120	1543640	called me out on this habit I have of
1543640	1545520	like I cast too wide a net well I asked
1545520	1546760	somebody a meaningful question and then
1546760	1549280	I fucking go go go the questions are
1549280	1552040	great I love them it's it's the
1552040	1553960	interjections it's the it's my constant
1553960	1556840	doing like I think it's about me ah you

1634560	1636560	everyone like it was like from CNN CNBC
1636560	1638920	like whatever it was and you're like we
1638920	1640920	need someone to take them to like do
1640920	1642040	like some interpretation like the
1642040	1644160	front line so it's actually not even it
1644160	1646400	sounds like like you said yeah do this
1646400	1648360	for my country exactly journalists
1648360	1650280	exactly I was like yeah I would love to
1650280	1652520	help cuz like at the time there was like
1652520	1654360	a week when the revolution started like
1654360	1656040	where there was like no news coverage
1656040	1658720	happening at all and no one outside of
1658720	1661160	Libya knew how can more awareness be a
1661160	1663360	bad thing exactly so when these people
1663360	1665480	came with oh I'm excited like to like I
1665480	1667200	want everyone outside to know what's
1667200	1669160	happening and I want them to like
1669160	1671760	capture that like correctly because like
1671760	1673120	they would like we're going around the
1673120	1674480	city asking people and people like we're
1674480	1676080	not speaking English that well so they
1676080	1678440	take whatever they assume that they say
1678440	1680240	they're just like Indiana Jones like
1680240	1684000	you're finishing writing hot dog on the
1684000	1685720	blackboard exactly there's a girl
1685720	1688200	blinking I love you it's written I love
1688200	1689920	you as under eyelids and then your boss
1689920	1692240	goes like some government guys some CNN
1692240	1694920	guys want to take you in like and you're
1694920	1696720	like god damn it this is such a romantic
1696720	1699000	adventurous job exactly I was like so
1699000	1700520	excited at the time like oh I'll take
1700520	1701720	them the front lines that sounds
1701720	1705040	exciting and I did that one like we
1705040	1706840	like we driven for a while and we got
1706840	1708800	in there and it was like a like an area
1708800	1711000	where they're like you can't go across
1711000	1713160	this line because this is where like the
1713160	1715920	actual like fighting is happening and
1715920	1718480	journalists are like let's go across the
1718480	1721160	line and yeah let's do that yeah so I
1721160	1723040	take them and I mean there were some
1723040	1724440	moments where it was just like sometimes
1724440	1726080	it's just like oh it's easy job like
1726080	1727680	they're asking soldiers and they're like
1727680	1730680	and then there's a like other times we
1730680	1733360	were like everyone starts running and
1733360	1735320	you have no idea what's what you're
1735320	1737760	running away from and you just keep
1737760	1739440	going until like you just like hide
1739440	1741040	behind like a car or something I'm like
1741040	1742960	I don't know what's happening yeah yeah
1742960	1745160	at that time were you like there's good
1745160	1746840	guys and there's bad guys and I'm just
1746840	1749280	like yeah yeah at the time they were like
1749280	1750920	good guys and bad guys we knew who the
1750920	1753840	bad guy was but in a year after that it
1753840	1756280	was just like bad guys everywhere and
1756280	1758120	I'm like maybe I'm a bad guy now you're
1758120	1759920	like you never know what was happening
1760360	1761880	so who's in charge at this point is
1761880	1763560	Magaria for what's his name how do you
1763560	1765880	say that name like who's the like the
1765880	1767400	former president yeah yeah that was
1767400	1770000	Gaddafi during Gaddafi yeah during
1770000	1771720	what yeah during Gaddafi was like the
1771720	1773280	revolution against him and then he died
1773280	1776040	like ten months after so it was just
1776040	1778560	like the it was like so yeah how are you
1778560	1780320	seen by the locals are you seen as a
1780320	1783320	conspirator like with the West or that
1783320	1786240	started to happen after like like few
1786240	1788480	years in because I I was still doing
1788480	1790840	that job and then that's cool I was
1790840	1793000	working on it there was programs that
1793000	1794840	were sponsored by the US Embassy in
1794840	1798080	Benghazi and we had the we had the
1798080	1802080	ambassador like Christopher Stevens who
1802080	1803760	used to come here there all the time so
1803760	1806720	like though we we were seen as people
1806720	1808520	who worked with the embassy and like I'm
1808520	1810640	like a person who did that too so gotta
1810640	1812400	kind of put the spotlight on me also I
1812400	1813960	used to like is it because of the bag of
1813960	1815840	forgive my ignorance don't know anything
1815840	1817800	about that conflict or what the result
1817800	1819800	was is it is the situation that then
1819800	1822320	after you went to be a foreign exchange
1822320	1825240	student that the bad guys that the guys
1825240	1826520	you perceived as bad let's call it like
1826520	1829120	it became worse after I came here they
1829120	1832240	yeah did they take power they did take
1832240	1834280	power yeah and so you're you're over
1834280	1836520	here learning about quantum physics or
1836520	1838280	whatever Noam Chomsky I was I was
1838280	1840680	learning about conflict resolution yeah
1840680	1843160	and you're okay so now take that takes
1843160	1844320	us to this moment where you're getting
1844320	1846840	Facebook messages from loved ones yeah
1846880	1848720	I can't put myself in this situation no
1848720	1850160	I was I was getting text messages from
1850160	1852520	my mom and stuff and she's like hey like
1852520	1855280	yeah someone came by the house today and
1855280	1856760	they were asking for you and they like
1856760	1858080	came through your room and like take
1858080	1859720	some of your stuff and whatever I was
1859720	1861240	like they took my stuff look I was like
1861240	1864040	what did they take by the way I should
1864040	1866120	reject here for a second because it's
1866120	1868520	like I I take this for granted this guy
1868520	1870120	is incredibly funny he's a great
1870120	1872760	comedian who is like the like and that's
1872760	1876200	but even if even if you were a fireman
1876200	1877880	this would be an interesting story yeah
1877880	1880680	but like what's crazy about this is that
1880680	1883200	you still at this stage of this story
1883200	1885040	you haven't yet thought about a career
1885040	1887600	in comedy no and then yeah like as of a
1887600	1890520	couple years ago you're like legitimately
1890520	1893640	like Portland's like you know people
1893640	1896240	are excited about you and yeah like
1896240	1898160	because you're that good at stand-up yeah
1898160	1901760	like you weren't you won't say it but
1901760	1903640	that's what's like double ironic about
1903640	1904680	it is we have so much to talk about
1904680	1906320	about comedy theory and stuff yeah first
1906320	1908080	of the get through this thing I haven't
1908080	1908880	met somebody who's been in this
1908880	1910520	situation no absolutely I mean that
1910520	1914120	definitely makes sense yeah they went
1914120	1915960	to your house don't see your room yeah
1915960	1917680	and what were they like like looking for
1917680	1919960	your computer or they well my computer
1919960	1921480	was with me at the time but like they
1921480	1923000	were looking through my like they were
1923000	1924920	trying to find stuff that would like tie
1924920	1926600	me to the embassy because that happened
1926600	1928160	after the embassy attack and all of that
1928160	1931440	and also the thing is like as a Libyan
1931440	1933040	citizen when you want to come to the US
1933040	1935560	at the time is like a very very long
1935560	1938040	process because I was accepted in that
1938040	1940320	program I got my visa like two days or
1940320	1942160	so it was like very like a quick thing
1942160	1943600	because they've already done background
1943600	1945400	check and all of that so they were like
1945400	1947400	okay so this guy who we thought worked
1947400	1950600	with the US before went so easily to the
1950600	1952920	US there's no way he's not working for
1952920	1955080	the US that's ironic so they thought you
1955080	1956840	were like special services or like yep
1956840	1961560	that's incredibly ironic yeah they
1961560	1963320	thought your intelligence like they are
1963320	1966200	like like like Secret Service stuff yeah
1966200	1968400	exactly I was like such a compliment but
1968400	1975520	also at the time okay so yeah so you're
1975520	1977280	getting these I want to interject here
1977280	1979080	though emotionally and go like I because
1979080	1981680	I feel this anxiety even as a person who
1981680	1983520	doesn't even like I don't know I don't
1983520	1984760	know what your emotional connection is
1984760	1987000	to your family but you're getting you're
1987000	1988640	getting messages from back home that is
1988640	1990520	saying like they're tossing your room
1990520	1993160	yeah literally tossing your room your
1993160	1996480	bedroom what like like they're looking
1996480	2000720	for reasons to justify yeah making you
2000720	2002800	an enemy of the state while you're
2002800	2005080	sitting over here on a temporary lily
2005080	2007480	pad yeah that is our government's like
2007480	2011560	job to like either you know renew like a
2011560	2014240	library book or whatever and now but
2014240	2017040	what what what about your family like
2017040	2020000	are you in danger at that point at that
2020000	2021480	point yeah I mean they're tossing your
2021480	2023240	room then they're shaking your grandma
2023240	2025640	right no absolutely they eventually had
2025640	2027000	to leave the city like they left the
2027000	2028360	house they left the city they moved to
2028360	2029560	another city because they were like we
2029560	2030800	can't deal with the shitty so there's
2030800	2033160	like yeah a city that's more yeah they
2033160	2034800	wanted the capsule which is triply they
2034800	2036800	move because you're because you're an
2036800	2038880	intelligent interpreter because he has
2038880	2042120	connections in America exactly yeah they
2042120	2044000	were like we are we have more family in
2044000	2045840	that city is that because of the the
2045840	2048520	change of power in in Libya like the
2048520	2051240	like after Gaddafi died yes yeah because
2051240	2053160	they were like a lot of like like
2053160	2056680	religious extremism like I sort of a
2056680	2058480	free-for-all right yeah exactly yeah
2058480	2059640	because there was so many there was like
2059640	2061040	the Libyan military and then you have
2061040	2063040	like groups that like were like if you
2063040	2066280	had your stink on you exactly let's her
2066280	2069040	touched you as a baby bird exactly and
2069040	2071360	then after the embassy attack happened
2071360	2072640	and everything it became even worse
2072640	2075000	there because like these people like oh
2075000	2077000	cuz like the embassy attack was like a
2077000	2078760	statement as if like we're in power
2078760	2080200	this is like we can do whatever the fuck
2080200	2082200	we want so these people were like more
2082200	2086000	and more like in in power and and then
2086000	2087840	yeah so like I came here like getting
2087840	2090440	all of these messages and stuff I did I
2090440	2094400	feel terrified I feel bad not really
2094400	2097560	because I've had like worse stuff
2097560	2099080	happened when I was there so I was like
2099080	2101040	I was like it was like a mental state
2101040	2102840	what I was like in like no matter what
2102840	2105080	happens I'm like okay yeah I guess
2105080	2106200	there's something how we have to deal
2106200	2109440	with what's the worst stuff the worst
2109440	2111560	stuff is just like I've been shot at in
2111560	2115120	my car twice before the radio station I
2115120	2116680	used to work for it because I used to
2116680	2118960	host a radio show like was burned down
2118960	2121280	to the ground because they were like not
2121280	2124280	into what we were saying or stuff why
2124280	2125800	would you be shot at in your car was
2125800	2127840	that were you being targeted yeah I was
2127840	2129120	getting a lot of death threats even when
2129120	2130960	I was when I was being guys yeah how do
2130960	2134160	people know you they had seen you
2134160	2136280	walking around with yeah absolutely yeah
2136280	2138280	I mean like like people get like you're
2138280	2140720	a voice of opposition or were you even
2140720	2142760	at all it wasn't an opposition it was
2142760	2145040	more of like okay so we have no
2145040	2147040	government now what's gonna be like the
2147040	2148640	face of the new country and most of the
2148640	2152160	opinions that mean my co-host had were
2152160	2154600	to Western as they described them and
2154600	2156160	when I say Western it they were just
2156160	2158920	like yeah we want to accept religion
2158920	2160480	from government like we you don't we
2160480	2162400	want this and we want that we should we
2162400	2165440	should try that here I keep having this
2165440	2167160	like crazy like I lit this high-pitched
2167160	2169320	tone of my ear I'm like like your
2169320	2172360	family's safe now yeah quotes because
2172360	2174080	yes so we can continue to talk about this
2174080	2175920	no they're safe which is good just on
2175920	2177520	you is like I just keep thinking of this
2177520	2179440	family they're like Facebooking you and
2179440	2180800	go yeah yeah they tossed your room like
2180800	2182680	okay so they relocated to and they're
2182680	2186040	safe because the the story of you then
2186040	2188120	because I'm a narcissist so all I do is
2188120	2189800	put myself in your shoes yeah about what
2189800	2191360	if it was me and then I just want to
2191360	2194360	puke until I die like going like what
2194360	2196840	everyone hate like like they're they're
2196840	2199640	trying so you apply for asylum yeah in
2199640	2203320	in in the United States and and as the
2203320	2205600	policy is they go okay we'll look into
2205600	2209480	that and how describe that process yeah
2209480	2211320	so when you when you apply for an asylum
2211320	2214080	is a very very lengthy process it's you
2214080	2216680	have to look once you apply it's it's
2216680	2219080	first it's very expensive to do so okay
2219080	2221680	yeah if you want to because like if you
2221680	2224240	even like mark like one like wrong box
2224240	2225840	or something like that that can affect
2225840	2228160	the whole process so they like you have
2228160	2229920	to hire a lawyer so like that's like
2229920	2231800	three grand or something just to hire a
2231800	2233600	lawyer just to fill your papers and stuff
2233600	2235680	and like Europe in a like a person who's
2235680	2237440	like new to this place I'm like okay I
2237440	2239320	am just gonna like toss like three
2239320	2241560	grants to them and then every time
2241560	2243160	they're like asking for more papers and
2243160	2244600	everything cost money and you have to
2244600	2247040	pay fees and stuff so you keep going is
2247040	2249640	it do you totally ignorant of this is
2249640	2253800	there a channel of like you is asylum a
2253800	2255520	legitimate channel for people of means
2255520	2257800	because they can just afford it the way
2257800	2259200	like maybe Harrison Ford doesn't have to
2259200	2261520	stand in line at the DMV with me like
2261520	2264160	like that you can is there or our rich
2264160	2266360	people just they don't need asylum yeah
2266360	2267880	there's no way to kind of like cut and
2267880	2270120	get rich people like always like they
2270120	2271640	started a business and get a green card
2271640	2273840	this is how they do it but like I and I
2273840	2275200	wasn't like a person who couldn't
2275200	2276800	afford it but I was like kind of like in
2276880	2279440	the middle so I can I was like okay yeah
2279440	2281600	I was like afforded to do it the right
2281600	2283840	way and not make mistakes and that's it
2283840	2286720	all right so so you're talking when you
2286720	2288080	talk about these steps where you're
2288080	2289520	going through where I'm like oh my god
2289520	2291380	my heart is skipping beats yeah every
2291380	2293280	time you every time you go through one
2293280	2295760	of these cycles there's countless
2295760	2298120	thousands of people who who had to give
2298120	2300080	up at that point because oh if they had
2300080	2302120	to find a lawyer absolutely people yeah
2302120	2305120	people have like one one reason people
2305120	2307320	give up and that makes sense to me is
2307320	2309400	that the first eight months after you
2309400	2311080	apply for an asylum you're not allowed
2311080	2316000	to work you can't have a legal job so
2316000	2317560	you just have to find ways to make
2317560	2318960	money that's such a funny thing to me
2318960	2321200	yeah like funny in the air quotes I like
2321200	2323440	the idea of like oh wait what someone's
2323440	2325840	gonna kill you I don't believe you
2325840	2327160	exactly I think you're here to sell
2327160	2330360	peanuts exactly if I if I catch you
2330360	2332640	selling a single peanut instead of
2332640	2335760	fearing for your life since you have to
2335760	2338400	have connections and someone that you
2338400	2340620	have some have to have some lifeline to
2340620	2342760	take care of you absolutely yeah it's
2342760	2345200	like being a PA in Hollywood it's like a
2345200	2348360	simultaneous oppression and and privilege
2348360	2350680	where it's like you can't even qualify
2350680	2352440	to be mistreated unless your parents are
2352440	2354520	so who is taking care of you family from
2354520	2356600	back home or oh it was like I had to
2356600	2358040	like transfer all of the money I had
2358040	2360160	back home to to the US and like kind of
2360160	2362520	like spending that money and then I had
2362520	2364320	to get like like under the table jobs
2364320	2366320	and stuff like work for a food cart or
2366320	2368760	like do this and that to prove to our
2368760	2371800	government that you're not here to like
2371800	2373760	fuck around like you're actually here
2373760	2377720	and you can survive without a job I see
2377720	2379360	it you're not allowed to work yeah or
2379360	2380960	you're proving that you're here to steal
2380960	2382920	a job this is this is this is the reason
2382920	2384760	I believe they're doing that is it's
2384760	2386840	mostly to be like if you're serious about
2386840	2389120	being here you'll find ways because this
2389120	2390880	is the American dream is to struggle
2390880	2393280	fuck or whatever fucking because you
2393280	2395000	know how everyone is born here and have
2395000	2399160	to do that yeah yeah we just lied about
2399160	2401080	our cotton expertise and we got free
2401080	2406680	rides you paid no rent you paid no rent
2406680	2409320	right yeah job yeah you got free meals
2409320	2411440	you try it you know anything about
2411440	2416400	tobacco 110 degree weather happy
2416400	2421680	February I'm doing black history for my
2421680	2424280	workout I'm learning about so much and
2424280	2426640	after 300 years you got your visa that's
2426640	2430440	right oh my god and then in 1920 women
2430440	2434160	got theirs isn't that great but yeah I
2434160	2435400	don't want to get too political or
2435400	2438400	anything but it almost sounds like what
2438400	2440600	you're describing doesn't define the
2440600	2445280	word asylum yeah the original idea
2445280	2447960	behind that word is like if I could
2447960	2450440	it's almost like a believe the victim
2450440	2454520	thing yeah I don't like I maybe maybe
2454520	2457240	I'll book somebody that like works in
2457240	2459600	some office it's not gonna be an ice
2459600	2461920	agent it's not gonna be I maybe there's
2461920	2463120	someone on the other side of the issue
2463120	2465440	that can tell me oh god if we open those
2465440	2466800	floodgates but I just have this weird
2466800	2468680	sneaking suspicion that there is
2468680	2470920	absolutely not a zero-sum game going on
2470920	2473080	here where if everyone who came to your
2473080	2476680	borders and said I'm gonna die I'm
2476680	2478600	scared I'm gonna die or I'm already in
2478600	2480040	your country and I'm scared to go back
2480040	2482400	home if we said to all of those people
2482400	2485960	okay well all right here you go rubber
2485960	2488840	stamp that that what would happen would
2488840	2490560	be the destruction of America I just
2490560	2493200	choose to not believe that but see yeah
2493200	2495040	see the thing is like the thing is like
2495040	2498480	if they if they put more means and like
2498480	2500280	more money into the process of making
2500280	2503040	that a fast process that will help like
2503040	2505880	okay like they do a lot of like like
2505880	2508080	background check and stuff but in my
2508080	2510320	case for example like so you're worried
2510320	2512840	about me me maybe being not like a good
2512840	2514120	person I'm gonna do this in this
2514120	2516520	country blah blah blah you make I hate
2516520	2518080	for you to just shock up in a trailer
2518080	2520000	and make eight kids and eat seven of
2520000	2522960	them so although as a listener of true
2522960	2526320	crime I'd have to say absolutely you're
2526320	2529840	as welcome to do that as anybody it's
2529840	2533320	true equality yeah statistics bear out
2533320	2535080	but it's just so crazy to me because I'm
2535080	2537320	like they're like okay so you can apply
2537320	2539640	for an asylum eight months no job so
2539640	2541240	maybe you can do it illegally we don't
2541240	2543480	know do you do your thing and then you
2543480	2546240	get a work permit and then wait for four
2546240	2548800	years to have an interview so we can
2548800	2551000	decide based on the story that you tell
2551000	2553240	us if you're if you're being honest or
2553240	2555880	not now in those four years I'm here I
2555880	2557640	could have plotted so many things
2557640	2560880	against the u.s. yeah if you think I'm
2560880	2564240	a dangerous person how many did you I
2564240	2566760	started a career in stand-up comedy so
2566760	2568040	that's one thing that is a bit of a
2568040	2570000	plot against the u.s. I mean bumping a
2570000	2572200	lot of j-mores out there like that
2572200	2573640	you're gonna destabilize the comedic
2573640	2576920	industry yeah people actually look
2576920	2578520	that's the question isn't that four
2578520	2580880	years are Americans actually looking in
2580880	2583080	your home country to see if anything's
2583080	2584840	ever gone down do they really spend that
2584840	2587640	time well after after I did my after I
2587640	2589400	did my interview with the immigration
2589400	2591680	officer I realized they know nothing and
2591680	2594040	they were like you tell us everything
2594040	2596240	from the beginning it was three hours and
2596240	2598080	a half or just interview questions and
2598080	2600720	then being like so Libya okay tell us
2600720	2602600	more about that I'm like what have you
2602600	2604680	been doing for the past four that's a
2604680	2606960	little bit relief to me as yeah I'm
2606960	2614120	like sorry nope doesn't mean knowing
2614120	2617280	about nope so I'm a child of the 80s
2617280	2621240	if you're I my parents paid for the
2621240	2622800	bombing I bet they can't point to it on
2622800	2626080	a map now you had you had a run-in
2626080	2628120	recently in Spokane Washington are you
2628120	2630000	sick of talking about this or no we can
2630000	2632320	talk about it I want a segue but it's a
2632320	2634000	natural segue but it's like like that's
2634000	2635680	the thing is that it's almost a shame
2635680	2640040	it's like oh this all this like stuff
2640040	2641520	this struggle and stuff but it's also
2641520	2643480	like if it were if it were a strictly
2643480	2645360	comedy podcast and we were like hey
2645360	2647920	who's this new uprising comedy star you're
2647920	2651720	very funny and it's it's incredibly
2651720	2653520	interesting the idea that you were this
2653520	2657160	funny given how recently according to my
2657160	2659200	hour of research of you on Wikipedia
2659200	2661440	like and I said to you in the green room
2661440	2663760	is that like a is that an exaggeration or
2663760	2665680	did like it was like four years ago
2665680	2667280	somebody said to you in the height of
2667280	2670040	this like pressure where you're like I
2670040	2672840	was here in asylum I was an interpreter
2672840	2674880	and I'm like here studying this of that
2674880	2678440	and yeah it's like oh shit ticking clock
2678440	2680760	I may have to go back I don't know when
2680760	2685240	and someone said to you you should try
2685240	2687960	comedy yeah yeah it was in college
2687960	2689520	because I was I was thinking that I was
2689520	2690920	taking a public speaking class at the
2690920	2693240	time and then at the end of the term my
2693240	2694800	public speaking professor was like it
2694800	2696120	was like it was like have you tried
2696120	2697840	comedy and I was like I was like now I
2697840	2699600	haven't like yeah I know some open mics
2699600	2701120	can show you what to go and so like yeah
2701120	2703480	well let's let's do this and then I
2703480	2705680	they don't like oh this is a good
2705680	2708040	profession yeah I can yell at people on
2708040	2710440	the mic sounds cool there's a point
2710440	2711800	where if we could play a clip if we were
2711800	2714600	a good pot every TV show in the 90s or
2714600	2716760	something absolutely yeah like like so
2716760	2718960	that people could rest assured like
2718960	2721840	yeah you're very graceful and funny on
2721840	2723720	stage you do these things and honestly
2723720	2725120	like I was I was telling you in the
2725120	2726600	green room like I watched your one set
2726600	2728360	and I was like I wanted to dig in with
2728360	2730640	you about the minutia of what you're
2730640	2736160	doing on stage because I I tried to do
2736160	2738720	stand-up from 17 to god knows when I
2738720	2741480	really hung it up but like it is an art
2741480	2744880	that it like and here you are English
2744880	2747160	as a second language and you're on stage
2747160	2749200	and you there's really specific things
2749200	2751600	that you do like where you let the
2751600	2754440	audience not do anything yeah you're
2754440	2756280	you're doing a stand-up set in Portland
2756280	2758680	and you have this bit that's like where
2759040	2762120	it's just like it's very resonant
2762120	2764480	because you're like the tee-up is just
2764480	2766280	you talking about like gun rights and
2766280	2768760	that you're the setup is that you I so I
2768760	2770720	tweeted like oh I don't think that gun
2770720	2771920	rights this man I can't remember the
2771920	2773520	setup at all yeah yeah but it's it's
2773520	2775200	provocative enough that I would never
2775200	2780000	trust an audience to not fuck everything
2780000	2782600	up by reacting either positively with
2782600	2785120	applause or booing or harrumphing and
2785120	2788720	you just let it sit so patiently yeah
2788720	2791280	and then it makes your punchline so
2791280	2792920	funny because it all it is is like the
2792920	2795160	joke is like you go you tweet this thing
2795160	2799000	and it's like a gun control thing it's
2799000	2800480	basically like I don't think guns should
2800480	2802440	be this or that or whatever what's the
2802440	2804760	joke yeah let's hear this well if you
2804760	2807280	don't feel no no I yeah I can I got a
2807280	2809080	break that you are professional no I
2809080	2811680	can't do it I'm good I mean I know when
2811680	2814000	people talk when people tell me to do my
2814000	2816200	Sean Connery impression I'm like no I
2816200	2818760	can't do it cuz you ask well let's hear
2818760	2820600	Sean Connery most things down here don't
2820600	2822440	react the way over bullets okay all
2822440	2824920	right well whatever but it's like if you
2824920	2826560	if you if you work well under pressure
2826560	2828520	I'll tell you the joke yeah yeah yeah
2828520	2833120	so so yeah we we live in a such a weird
2833120	2834400	time because a lot of people have
2834400	2839280	opinions you know and have you seen
2839280	2843760	those yeah they're there and especially
2843920	2847040	like guns for example because a lot of
2847040	2848440	people have opinions about that and
2848440	2852400	mostly everyone is wrong and I as a
2852400	2853840	comedian like every time a shooting
2853840	2855120	happened or something I have to go on
2855120	2856720	social media and I have to like tweet
2856720	2859240	something clever you know to like raise
2859240	2864720	awareness that I exist and last time a
2864720	2866000	shooting happened I just went and I
2866000	2867600	tweeted and I wrote that we shouldn't be
2867600	2869640	sending thoughts and prayers and we
2869640	2873040	should be praying for more gun control
2873040	2877160	which to me sounded like a very logical
2877160	2881480	statement to post on the internet with
2881480	2886560	the name Mohanad and I believed in
2886560	2889720	everything I said until that guy Kevin
2889720	2894320	replied to me you guys know Kevin yeah
2894320	2897840	from social media yeah he's there too
2898560	2901200	and can reply to me this is what Kevin
2901200	2905320	said and I quote you fucking Muslim I
2905320	2913080	bacon 24-7 which is quite impressive like
2913080	2915360	man I don't eat bacon by thing that's
2915360	2919440	super unhealthy also probably the worst
2919440	2922920	argument against gun control just
2922920	2925680	shouting your favorite to that me yeah
2925680	2929280	Kevin is dead now yeah it's that pause
2929280	2931360	yeah that's the thing that I focus on
2931360	2935560	is the it's the pause where you describe
2935560	2936880	your tweet because I live in the
2936880	2939840	cynical world where whatever I think of
2939840	2942040	Portland I don't even know I was like
2942040	2943720	I'm watching from Los Angeles I'm
2943720	2945520	watching the YouTube clip of you in
2945520	2947520	front of a hundred people in Portland
2947520	2949760	yeah and I don't know what's going
2949760	2952000	through your head when you're willing to
2952000	2956240	go so I tweeted thoughts and prayers and
2956240	2960280	yeah and a wall I've become so jaded so
2960280	2963200	cynical that I'm like I would never ever
2963200	2966560	I gotta I gotta I can't I can't let this
2966560	2970280	rest happen because someone will fuck it
2970280	2972200	up can you talk about that like what
2972200	2974880	you're did you vet that silence I mean
2974880	2977080	no I mean like the silence exists there
2977080	2979280	for a reason because like yes like some
2979280	2980800	of the jokes I do like people would do
2980800	2982520	that like someone would jump in or like
2982520	2984880	like whews or something or just say
2984880	2986320	something stupid and just ruin the whole
2986320	2988760	thing but I've done it like few times to
2988760	2991440	see like like that silence makes it like
2991440	2994440	even better and I think I think it's
2994440	2996320	mostly because the way I say it because
2996320	2998320	I talk like very slowly and stuff and
2998320	3000000	like people like I give people the
3000000	3001360	impression like there's something else
3001360	3004000	coming out so like people like on the
3004000	3005640	edge to see like what's gonna come next
3005640	3007480	so no one will like interrupt the
3007480	3009800	silence and I think I think it's yeah I
3009800	3011040	think like the setup of someone else
3011040	3012760	says it like it would be like more like
3012760	3016160	yeah but like when I say they're like I
3016160	3018160	don't know where this is going but I
3018160	3020800	want to hear it I think that's gotta be
3020800	3023240	like yeah that's so Portland yeah I'm
3023240	3026160	assuming it's a place in the States that
3026160	3029400	you can do comedy in Arabic no I would
3029400	3031280	never do comedy in Arabic I don't know
3031280	3033200	have you ever tried to make yeah I like
3033200	3035000	I can tell stories in Arabic but like
3035000	3037000	the structure of like a set up punch
3037000	3039440	line is like such a like foreign concept
3039440	3041000	to Arabic language that if you did it
3041000	3043360	like people like why are you quiet like
3043360	3046400	why did you why did you pause yeah for
3046400	3047760	real like I never thought of that so
3047760	3050200	like like is there any stand-up culture
3050200	3052360	in Arabic like in any in there is in
3052360	3054120	some countries yeah like if you go like
3054120	3056040	countries like Lebanon if you go to Dubai
3056040	3058240	if you go to like it's more getting like
3058240	3060240	more recognized and stuff but everything
3060240	3061280	I've seen is like with like more
3061280	3063040	storytelling and I think it has to do
3063040	3064840	with the Arabic language is like more
3064840	3066640	like like you like you have to keep
3066640	3068320	going you have to keep going like and
3068320	3070560	just like it has to be like long
3070560	3072680	stories and like so you can't just do
3072680	3074920	like set up punchline like like like
3074920	3078080	pauses like like exactly yeah like
3078080	3080440	traditional American style exactly yeah
3080440	3082320	that set up punchlines absolutely
3082320	3084000	because like this is a way that I've
3084000	3085880	learned how to talk in English that way
3085880	3087640	when I do when I did it here because
3087640	3089840	like when I speak in Arabic I never
3089840	3091840	talked this way like I'm like I talk way
3091840	3094520	faster and like when you when you speak
3094520	3096200	when I speak air like even when I'm
3096200	3098000	telling a funny story in Arabic it's
3098000	3099720	always like full of like energy and
3099720	3101360	more like talking like way faster while
3101360	3102880	in English I'm like politically incorrect
3102880	3104960	to go like let's just even though we
3104960	3106200	won't understand it I just want to hear
3106200	3108400	you tell a story really fast in Arabic
3108400	3111680	just so it's not like a weird is there a
3111680	3113240	funny bar joke like I got like a
3113240	3115200	straight-up joke joke like an Arabic
3115200	3117520	classic like like a guy goes into a bar
3117520	3119680	and the bartender says whatever like
3119680	3123880	well we don't have bars yeah it's
3123880	3126120	already funny yeah I know like like like
3126120	3129800	like a proper just straight-up like I'm
3129800	3131160	trying to think with it was like a
3131160	3132320	story I would like remember that was
3132320	3134120	just like say it out loud but if you I
3134120	3135360	don't know maybe you can give me a few
3135360	3137040	sentences I can say them in Arabic that
3137040	3139320	would be okay give me a joke yeah okay
3139320	3141680	so a guy goes into a doctor's office and
3141680	3147600	the doctor says a guy will be an
3147600	3150720	interpreter and he'll be pretend I'm
3150720	3152720	Arabic even though I can't understand
3152720	3156840	it yeah it let and translate his I have
3156840	3160280	to go the same speed as he okay so a guy
3160280	3163440	is getting his annual physical and the
3163440	3165280	doctor looks at his chart and says sir
3165280	3166600	I'm afraid you're gonna have to stop
3166600	3168920	masturbating and the guy says why the
3168920	3170440	guy doctor says because I'm trying to
3170440	3175060	give you a physical what is what is Ted
3175060	3178400	couple saying to me I'm I don't
3178400	3180880	understand tell that joke in Arabic
3180880	3183640	I'm sure doctor will amass check check
3183640	3186040	me in fashion that they look at the end
3186040	3187720	of in your fee fee I'm a leader to one
3187720	3196880	oh no no but for real wait you were done
3196880	3200960	yeah I was yeah yeah yeah that was I was
3200960	3204880	yes is that a notable thing that like
3204880	3207720	the there wasn't like a big fucking yeah
3207720	3209960	you just go to the end like people can
3209960	3212120	just follow with you like is that is
3212120	3214360	that a link is that a number on a thing
3214360	3215640	there you would just like do you know
3215640	3218360	the difference between Dubai and Abu
3218360	3221800	Dhabi oh absolutely yeah well okay oh
3221800	3224560	that's a joke okay yeah there are two
3224560	3226280	different let them tell you it's worth
3226280	3228040	it oh yeah tell me the joke though
3228040	3230600	people from I'm surprised you don't know
3230600	3234480	this people from Dubai do not like the
3234480	3236840	Flintstones but people from Abu Dhabi do
3236840	3243400	yeah don't tell that in Arabic don't
3243400	3246520	don't let me be the angel on your
3246520	3249080	shoulder I do want to ask though but
3249080	3253120	because I'm fast it was it's a fucking
3253120	3255960	good joke it's a good joke you know that
3255960	3259160	don't be defiant about it it might be
3259160	3261640	or might not be I had that joke so much
3261640	3270640	it's arguably but but I the ice I
3270640	3273520	polyglots I'm always like they make me
3273520	3275800	feel ashamed and loving my joke by the
3275800	3278000	way wonder about they still the joke is
3278000	3279760	still washing over him he still loves it
3279760	3283000	I always want to know this idea of like
3283000	3284760	when do you think in one language and
3284760	3286240	translate it to another in your head you
3286240	3287640	said something in the green room yeah
3287640	3290080	like I think I've heard it before from
3290080	3291760	other people that are bilingual there
3291760	3294280	you said there was a transition but tell
3294280	3296560	me yeah no yeah for the first few years
3296560	3298640	here I would like like I would speak in
3298640	3300080	English but I would like talking Arabic
3300080	3301720	and I always had like that transition
3301720	3303400	where I'm like like when you tell me
3303400	3304920	something it just like goes into that
3304920	3306520	fast process like from like English to
3306520	3309040	Arabic at the like Arabic to English now
3309040	3310960	I'm at the point like where I even have
3310960	3312720	my dreams in English like I would be
3312720	3314500	like I'm fully gentrified now so it
3314500	3317760	changes which I'd never that's the
3317760	3319000	thing like when you when you learn a
3319000	3320160	language and they say when you start
3320160	3321680	dreaming and then in the other language
3321680	3323400	that means you your brain is like
3323400	3325680	absolutely yeah and and now it's it's
3325680	3327200	very strange because like when I talk to
3327200	3328840	my parents and obviously like we talk in
3328840	3331200	Arabic like sometimes like I have I
3331200	3335280	find myself being like what was was that
3335280	3337560	word and they're like who are you like
3337560	3341040	yeah do you think what you do is that
3341040	3343000	uncomfortable to talk about it tell me
3343000	3344640	stop at any time but like what is that
3344640	3346720	relationship like you are after all an
3346720	3350040	astronaut that like came over the
3350040	3351800	asylum thing happened yeah I'm back
3351800	3353500	sense right yeah I haven't been back in
3353500	3356920	five years emotionally is there any does
3356920	3359440	that generate any conflict it it's I
3359440	3360960	mean it's it's definitely a hard smell
3360960	3363200	like honestly like and like I do miss
3363200	3364560	them a lot and everything and it's very
3364560	3366840	hard on them too because it's just like
3366840	3369760	because that's just because like in in
3369760	3371400	like a Libyan culture and stuff like
3371400	3374040	that like you you live as a family like
3374040	3375720	together like you don't leave the house
3375720	3377200	until like you get married there's no
3377200	3379000	like oh he's going to college now you
3379000	3381120	leave like everyone lives together like
3381120	3382400	in a big house so like there's always
3382400	3384680	this family structure so were you kind
3384680	3386400	of a sorry to rewind your child yeah
3386400	3390000	then so were you like were you a freak
3390000	3392480	were you were they like were they like
3392480	3395040	what's up with behind it he's like he's
3395040	3399280	like so weirdly verbal or it like just
3399280	3401240	in comparison to that where yeah like
3401240	3404920	was there a departure in your childhood
3404920	3408840	where was there a point where where
3408840	3411600	there was this conversation about well
3411600	3414040	you're gonna go to you're gonna keep
3414040	3416080	talking because you're a talker yeah
3416080	3419760	yeah it's I mean I mean I mean like my
3419760	3423240	my parents like would like their thing
3423240	3425840	with me is like they would always be
3425840	3427800	like hey do whatever you want you can
3427800	3429160	talk about whatever but like can you
3429160	3433680	like tone it down a bit yeah because
3433680	3435440	they're like sometimes like my mom like
3435440	3436720	would like I would be outside of the
3436720	3438200	house and I post something on Facebook
3438200	3439560	and she immediately calls me like
3439560	3442280	delete this right now yeah I'm like
3442280	3444720	English too or just you what's that
3444720	3446520	did your family speak English as well
3446520	3449160	my my siblings do it none of my parents
3449160	3451040	do they like kind of understand it but
3451040	3452840	they they they've never like learned
3452840	3454840	English so like by they made sure that
3454840	3456160	me and my siblings like were like
3456160	3457960	learning English since we were like
3457960	3460200	super young but them like they don't
3460200	3461240	really speak it that well are you
3461240	3462720	allowed to go back home right now are
3462720	3464880	you know because that's part of the
3464880	3466960	whole asylum process and getting the
3466960	3468960	green card I cannot go back until I
3468960	3471720	become a citizen in few years because
3471720	3473840	the your whole case is built on the fact
3473840	3475640	that always too dangerous for me to go
3475640	3477720	back right so if you go back you're kind
3477720	3479040	of like oh have you been lying this
3479040	3481000	whole time when you're on your asylum
3481000	3482760	status so you can't do that yeah even if
3482760	3484560	it gets better they're like you have to
3484560	3486400	all the people coming from Venezuela
3486400	3488600	and Central America that are coming in
3488600	3490280	and seeking asylum the same thing for
3490280	3491720	them to absolutely but they don't have
3491720	3495320	the resource for lawyers and they do
3495320	3497240	not know they do not and obviously like
3497240	3498720	the the immigration like they were like
3498720	3499920	yeah we'll give you a lawyer and that
3499920	3501320	lawyer is like handling a hundred case
3501320	3504640	so there's so many like and like even
3504640	3506880	with a lawyer even with everything like
3506880	3510320	the process is very vague yeah it's like
3510320	3512680	they're like because when I when I when
3512680	3514160	I applied they're like okay so when I do
3514160	3515920	when do I do my interview and they were
3515920	3519520	like a few months a year two years and
3519520	3522360	then it was four so there was like no
3522360	3524200	like you just like living in a limbo
3524200	3526280	like okay do I start my life do I and
3526280	3527960	they're like we just have to wait I
3527960	3530280	don't know so how close are you to the
3530280	3531600	finish line of this where you actually
3531600	3534040	get citizenship well I I finally I
3534040	3536240	finished like I did the biggest step was
3536240	3538240	getting your asylum approved which I did
3538240	3540640	in last October which was which was
3540640	3541800	great because it was such a relief
3541800	3543520	because I was like I'm like doing comedy
3543520	3545760	and doing all of that but not knowing if
3545760	3547880	I'm like because if they decline it was
3547880	3551200	just like it's it's like okay well you
3551200	3553080	either have to pay more money and hire
3553080	3554760	a lawyer again and do all of that or
3554760	3557160	you're welcome to leave so there was
3557160	3559120	that so when I got it got approved I was
3559120	3561760	like okay so okay that's this is good
3561760	3564840	so you're good to go now well now yeah
3564840	3566800	and next October I get my green card
3566800	3568240	which is great so I can come and go out
3568240	3570400	like and travel and like do all of that
3570400	3573880	and then in three years from now I do
3573880	3577320	become a citizen but to make no mistake
3577320	3578880	about it and sorry if this is like
3578880	3580760	yeah insensitive or whatever but this is
3580760	3585680	just me going like what my I just I'm
3585680	3587480	putting myself in these shoes and I'm
3587480	3590640	going like so there are points in your
3590640	3592160	life and I don't know how long they are
3592160	3593400	and I don't know how extreme the walls
3593400	3595720	of it are but like you have to
3595720	3597600	legitimately fear the idea that you're
3597600	3600000	gonna get a letter whether it's pink
3600000	3602520	stationery or a knock on the door it's
3602520	3605000	some bureaucratic thing that's gonna go
3605000	3607680	you get it now it didn't work you're
3607680	3610720	going back and you're gonna be like on
3610720	3612920	an airplane and you're on the airplane
3612920	3615160	and not only are you miserable because
3615160	3618640	all airline travel is garbage even if
3618640	3622080	you're first class these people hate me
3622080	3623400	and they love flaunting it with their
3623400	3626560	sarcastic applause but you're like like
3626560	3628960	like legitimately like cuz I mean like I
3628960	3632320	like you just this like you have to you
3632320	3635800	have to atone yeah with a with a with a
3635800	3639440	death in your head that that someone
3639440	3642160	would go that you would you would be
3642160	3644120	sent back and then and then you would
3644120	3646360	get to an airport which everyone that's
3646360	3648360	traveled knows you're not in control of
3648360	3650240	your life because that's their airports
3650240	3652440	absolutely just like jump off a plane
3652440	3653760	like Arnold Schwarzenegger and be like
3653760	3656480	I'm gonna run through the swamp like
3656480	3659160	there's no you come through a gate it's
3659160	3661680	all controlled and anyone that wants to
3661680	3663760	once you're in that country so do how
3663760	3666400	gay please like I unless you're
3666400	3668000	uncomfortable talking no it's like how
3668000	3671080	high was that fear is that fear of like
3671080	3674280	the of going back to a place where
3674280	3676760	people will put a black bag over your
3676760	3678440	head or am I being ignorant or like
3678440	3681600	that's no that's sadly was the case too
3681600	3683400	yeah like don't like no like I go back
3683400	3685400	I'll probably kill you live in fear of
3685400	3686920	that happening and how much do you
3686920	3690280	currently fear that now not as much now
3690280	3691840	and not because like I like I have my
3691840	3693160	asylum approved and stuff so it's like
3693160	3695440	illegal to even like be like oh you get
3695440	3697360	deported unless you like unless you could
3697360	3699160	like commit like a like a criminal like
3699160	3701120	something like huge like criminal
3701120	3702880	offense or something then you like you're
3702880	3706160	you're safe but like yeah even like the
3706160	3708880	past few years the there was a fear like
3708880	3713840	I would say from 2014 to 2016 so there
3713840	3716520	was you know what I'm going dates random
3716520	3718040	dates I don't know why I know where I'm
3718040	3720560	going with that and like 2006 and then
3720560	3722560	to until 2000 like okay I'm still like
3722560	3729000	good and then there was a change and yeah
3729000	3730880	and then it became like it went like
3730880	3735120	from 40 to 100 but I'm sure you're that
3735120	3736440	I'm sure that's a figment of your
3736440	3738360	imagination because I have I'm
3738360	3740960	absolutely positive that you have no
3740960	3743160	real-world evidence that anything
3743160	3745480	actually changed from day to day that's
3745480	3747720	there all you were already in America
3747720	3749840	for all those years and then that

3866240	3868040	event I was like yeah sure yeah I'll
3868040	3870680	come and do it so I took the bus to get
3870680	3874160	there because it's like by bus was like
3874160	3875960	five to six hours or so because it was
3875960	3877160	like snow he's like I'm not gonna drive
3877160	3882600	I got there I did my set on Saturday it
3882600	3886680	went really well all right yeah don't
3886680	3889400	look it up yeah it went great it was
3889400	3891520	amazing he's a good comic and also all
3891520	3894120	college crowds are a gimme yeah it was
3894120	3899240	really bad you really oh my god it was
3899240	3901520	it was like yeah did you bomb or did
3901520	3904360	the audience just not dig it the it was
3904360	3906600	like so the crowd like with like mostly
3906600	3908520	students and then I discovered that most
3908520	3910520	of them were like promised extra credit
3910520	3913480	if they attend so I was talking to a
3913480	3915120	crowd of people who are looking at their
3915120	3917440	phones and not even looking at me and I
3917440	3919280	did 10 minutes of material like to like
3919280	3922280	just no one and they're like I feel like
3922280	3924120	it was like a full room too and then I
3924120	3926480	sat on the stage and they're just
3926480	3928000	interviewing people like where are you
3928000	3930000	from that's trash it's like an old man
3930000	3932120	you know and they just like start
3932120	3933960	yelling at people and stuff and they
3933960	3936680	laughed a bit at that and then yeah so I
3936680	3938160	did my say I got paid everything I'm
3938160	3939600	like okay yeah I'm gonna leave this town
3939600	3942240	and they're never gonna coming back you
3942240	3945080	back on that safe ass bus yeah I got on
3945080	3947680	the bus then we had we had to do a bus
3947680	3949360	transfer in Spokane so that was the
3949360	3950920	reason I was there I had to wait for
3950920	3953440	three hours then I get I get on the bus
3953440	3955320	the bus is here on time which is great
3955320	3957880	again on the bus just sitting in the
3957880	3959600	back looking at my phone and stuff and
3959600	3961800	then these two people in uniform like
3961800	3964560	come in and they were just like start
3964560	3966040	walking around and then like but the bus
3966040	3968040	stops or you back that up though what's
3968040	3970280	that the bus stops somewhere specific
3970280	3972040	before these guys get on no it was at
3972040	3973840	the Greyhound station so we haven't left
3973840	3976000	yet he's transferred in Spokane yeah
3976000	3978800	exactly so it's like I've never traveled
3978800	3984560	by bus yeah god be nice did the there's
3984560	3992200	still time is it it's like if you're
3992200	3993840	going an eight-hour trip do you tend to
3993840	3995800	just sit there and it stops at Greyhound
3995800	3998000	stations yeah you wait you sit in the
3998000	4000640	shitty station and you you don't get off
4000640	4002000	the bus if you're just taking the whole
4002000	4005240	trip so see no it was it was so first
4005240	4007480	bus from Pullman to Spokane and then
4007480	4009800	left that bus because that bus doesn't
4009800	4011480	go all the way okay it only goes to
4011480	4013520	Spokane then waited in the station for
4013520	4015200	three hours and then the other bus
4015200	4017600	game that was going to to Portland okay
4017600	4019320	so yeah just like I'm I don't know
4019320	4021440	flights like how like it was like a
4021440	4022520	transit kind of thing I just want to
4022520	4024440	contextualize like these guys getting on
4024440	4025600	the bus are they getting on the bus
4025600	4027920	before a trip starts before the trip
4027920	4030440	started yes yes so everyone's sad yeah
4030440	4032080	everyone's sad and we were just guys
4032080	4033840	get out yeah they got on and then they
4033840	4035640	were like looking at like they were like
4035640	4037240	pointing at random people and they and
4037240	4039040	I can like vaguely hear what they were
4039040	4041200	saying and then they came to you I was
4041200	4042680	like oh they're probably like asking for
4042680	4044320	ID is he trying to match your ID with
4044320	4046960	your ticket it's it's fine like because
4046960	4048880	you know they're cracking down on the
4048880	4054800	bus yeah yeah great hound yeah but so
4054800	4056720	you know what but seriously like at in
4056720	4058560	that moment you think these guys work
4058560	4061560	for greyhound yes yes absolutely thought
4061560	4063360	they work for greyhound I was like it
4063360	4065160	was like yeah this is how it works like
4065160	4067360	traveling by bus is amazing why would
4067360	4070400	why would why would greyhound let why
4070400	4072480	would they not divert funding into having
4072600	4074040	what do they look like describe they
4074040	4076040	they they look like they were like big
4076040	4078080	picture they were like yeah they're like
4078080	4079680	buff guys and they're just like like
4079680	4081360	wearing uniforms and stuff and they're
4081360	4083840	like yeah can we see an ID and I was
4083840	4086600	like here you go this might be are they
4086600	4088360	skipping sorry sorry were they going
4088360	4089480	straight at you or that were they doing
4089480	4091880	it to everybody they asked for people to
4091880	4093760	be specific they asked for people are
4093760	4097200	you noticing I'm not I'm not I the the
4097200	4100080	people they asked looked vaguely ethnic
4100080	4102240	okay and that might they're skipping over
4102240	4103960	people their best can be described like
4103960	4106360	oh this person looks his back okay yeah
4106360	4108760	they asked me for my idea like oh I
4108760	4110400	gave them idea like oh gonna gonna go
4110400	4111560	like you don't need my ticket and they're
4111560	4113400	like no do you have then deal they were
4113400	4115640	like are you a US citizen I was like oh
4115640	4117040	that's that's such a weird thing for
4117040	4119480	them to ask I was like I was like no I'm
4119480	4121080	not and they were like what like what's
4121080	4122600	your country of citizenship was like
4122600	4125560	Libya and they were like okay yeah come
4125560	4129840	with us yeah and I was like okay took
4129840	4131920	you off the bus I still had no idea who
4131920	4134880	these people were you really hadn't
4134880	4136760	identified themselves no they didn't say
4136760	4138200	anything when they came in into the bus
4138200	4139800	they said nothing so they took me out
4139800	4141520	they took two people other people out
4141520	4143600	and then the fourth person they asked
4143600	4145120	they asked him if he was he was a
4145120	4147000	citizen he said yes and then you're like
4147000	4149600	prove it who he pulled here his u.s.
4149600	4152520	passport I don't like this is very weird
4152520	4156560	okay so all the other people passed the
4156560	4159720	check is what you're saying yeah I mean
4159960	4161880	they looked at them and they passed I
4161880	4163040	mean some of the people they have a
4163040	4164360	proof of citizenship they had their
4164360	4167280	driver's licenses exactly yeah and they
4167280	4169240	were like oh that's cool yeah sometimes
4169240	4171200	you can look at a person like a citizen
4171200	4173120	and you were like I'm from Libya and I
4173120	4175480	have asylum and they're like yeah off

4189080	4192040	three like I'm picturing these guys in
4192040	4194800	a certain way and I'm wondering like so
4194800	4196960	if they're facing you and you're on a
4196960	4198920	bus and then they're like you're coming
4198920	4201640	off the bus as they turn their back and
4201640	4203520	you're following them do you not see
4203520	4207400	this logo on the back is that or am I
4207400	4210280	just do I say ice on the battle well

4219040	4221080	they they're both under homeland
4221080	4224560	security so they work together these two
4224560	4226040	agents were there from like that
4226040	4229040	separate agency which is I'll get it
4229040	4230640	that part too because that was like very
4230640	4234400	interesting on the internet but so I got
4234400	4235360	out with them and they were like do you

4321360	4322760	to them and that's it you don't need to
4322760	4325120	carry a paper with you if you genuinely
4325120	4327160	have asylum you have a place to keep
4327160	4330360	your asylum papers exactly if you're
4330360	4331960	walking around with all your papers
4331960	4334400	maybe you're just a fire cabinet just
4334400	4336200	like walking around like everything is
4336200	4339640	here all right so what happens next
4339640	4341880	thing so I gave it to them I gave them
4341880	4343320	and then I was like I don't have it I
4343320	4345080	was like but I do have these papers and
4345080	4346440	they were like ah these can be easily
4346440	4349400	falsified I was like what I was like no
4349400	4351240	there's no I was like this work permit
4351240	4353840	is fraud proof like you can't you can't
4353840	4356920	you can't do that like since 2011 you
4356920	4359240	guys updated it and it you can't change
4359240	4361200	it anymore I like yeah I'm like I read
4361200	4364080	your website like almost every day they
4364080	4366840	and they love you now they hated me so
4366840	4369960	much yeah because you're verbal exactly
4369960	4372320	they're they were like we're not they
4372320	4374280	were like really not into me because
4374280	4376400	they're used the reason they they target
4376400	4378320	greyhound but it's a very cheap bus so
4378320	4379920	like most of the people who use it are
4379920	4382840	like like people are like people like
4382840	4384880	kind of like people a lot of people of
4384880	4386600	color use it in the area a lot of people
4386600	4388280	who are like immigrants Hispanic and
4388280	4390200	stuff they use it so they know what to
4390200	4392240	target they're not gonna like go on some
4392240	4394640	fancy bus it's just like wealthy white
4394640	4396560	people inside of it because there will
4396560	4401200	be inconvenient so they're there to
4401200	4403920	rumble you because they these are ice
4403920	4406240	people ice officers so CBB they're like
4406240	4407600	okay yeah there are two different
4407600	4409960	organizations that both of them work
4409960	4412360	together they basically do the same job
4412360	4414320	right yeah they yeah they're both
4414320	4416440	horrible so they they think you
4416440	4418120	falsified your papers or like
4418120	4420480	they give you stuff back right still
4420480	4422080	not giving me at my stuff back they were
4422080	4424120	like holding to them and I was like at
4424120	4425440	that taking shit like your cell phone
4425440	4427560	and no didn't take my cell phone yeah
4427560	4429760	so they they had like I had my papers
4429760	4431960	and I was like I was like no my papers
4431960	4433680	are legal and they kept using the word
4433680	4436520	legal small and every sentence that
4436520	4438360	comes out of my mouth they were like yeah
4438360	4441160	legal say that all the time like no
4441160	4443120	matter what I say that's probably very
4443120	4446320	true exactly yeah I'm like I say
4446320	4447680	something like yeah we've heard that
4447680	4451320	before I'm like what okay whatever and
4451320	4453320	damn illegals and your story structure
4453320	4457600	get us every time that second act that
4457600	4461160	made us let him go looks like we got us
4461160	4467680	a talker we got a fucking horse to sell
4467680	4471840	it definitely look like an Elliot for
4471840	4475160	sure yeah I saw on Twitter was like
4475600	4480160	like the point where you have spoken
4480160	4483040	your case like misunderstandings whatever
4483040	4485640	like let's let's do an NPR segment about
4485640	4486760	what they're going through and what
4486760	4489120	they're profiling and whatever I I'd be
4489120	4491920	shockingly sympathetic to whatever the
4491920	4494440	fuck is going on but you you you have
4494440	4497480	said I have this I have that I have that
4497480	4500360	and they call it in yes and you can hear
4500360	4502640	yeah I can hear like it was like like a
4502640	4503840	woman's voice on the other side they
4503840	4506280	were like reading numbers out of my my
4506280	4508360	work permit my like my immigration status
4508360	4510960	and stuff and I can hear on the phone
4510960	4513560	they were like okay yeah oh okay so it's
4513560	4516280	in the system okay yeah okay and then
4516280	4517880	looks at me like yeah there's no records
4517880	4522120	of that now what was that let's focus in
4522120	4525360	on that yeah because that point like I
4525360	4527240	was like really frustrated I was like
4527240	4529080	okay this is like getting cuz like
4529080	4530360	throughout the whole thing I was like
4530360	4532320	being calm because I'm like cuz I'm
4532320	4534480	like you know what this is inconvenient
4534480	4536040	but once they make their calls and they
4536040	4538560	see that I'm like in the system just
4538560	4540640	take my mind races is a middle-aged white
4540640	4542400	guy and yeah an oppressor and all this
4542400	4544520	stuff and I go okay zoom in say why why
4544520	4545800	if I get figure out how to be this guy
4545800	4548240	and I go okay I'm I don't like to admit
4548240	4550520	making a mistake I'm embarrassed I'm
4550520	4553240	flustered is that what that is felt that
4553240	4555120	way but also like it felt like they're
4555120	4556800	trying to break me at that point they're
4556800	4558360	like okay if we can't get you on that
4558360	4559600	we're gonna get you on something
4559600	4560680	different do you think they really
4560680	4562960	thought at that point that that's my
4562960	4564800	fascination of the story is that yeah
4564800	4566240	do you think that they thought if they
4566240	4568320	bluffed you would eventually go okay I
4568320	4572080	masterminded 9-11 or do you think that
4572080	4575560	they were like going one doesn't just
4575560	4577600	get out of this valley with a ladder
4577600	4580240	one needs to create a beach I honestly
4580240	4582440	think it was like both it's like from
4582440	4584160	what I read and stuff like they do that
4584160	4585720	to people so they can break down like
4585720	4587360	and just like say that they've done
4587360	4590480	something or whatever and also that like
4590480	4591680	they're not gonna make it easy they
4591680	4593680	kind of like want to leave you with like
4593680	4596880	like yeah don't fuck with us like yeah
4596880	4598720	have your everything on you next time
4598720	4600680	like we're not to be played with and
4600680	4603000	stuff but like so it got to them like
4603000	4604760	and I they were talking to one another
4604760	4606520	but they wouldn't I didn't hear what
4606520	4607480	they were saying because they would do
4607480	4608880	the thing where they whisper to one
4608880	4612200	another and like okay yeah whatever and
4612200	4614600	then and then once they told me that I
4614600	4617320	have no records and I was like there's
4617320	4618960	no way okay I was like I was like you
4618960	4621560	know what my case is approved you know
4621560	4622840	I think what you're doing now is
4622840	4625040	illegal and if you don't give me my
4625040	4627480	papers back I need I'm gonna call my
4627480	4628960	lawyer I'm gonna pursue legal action
4628960	4630440	this is like getting too much there you
4630440	4633160	go this is a terrifying threshold yeah
4633160	4635800	and and even at that like said it like
4635800	4637760	very calmly because what was it how did
4637760	4639040	that register in their eyes when you
4639040	4640640	said that oh I'm sure they loved it
4640640	4643080	immediately once I finished that sentence
4643080	4645760	the officer that hasn't spoken award the
4645760	4647920	whole time started yelling at me to take
4647920	4651720	my hands out of my pocket whoa yeah what
4651720	4653560	temperature is it it was like freezing
4653560	4655000	cold and they were like wearing gloves
4655000	4656960	and stuff and the thing is like I had
4656960	4659240	them in for 20 minutes right now you
4659240	4661240	decide you're hanging out there yeah I
4661240	4663480	would both detonators are ready to go
4663480	4667600	exactly at this point no blast there are
4667600	4671480	I mean for you to like you're gonna
4671480	4674880	actually put more effort okay so so you
4674880	4678120	bring up you say hey you what you're
4678120	4679840	doing is illegal I'll lawyer up and they
4679840	4681960	now are treating you like you might have
4681960	4683720	a weapon on you exactly so I mean I'm
4683720	4685360	like I have watched enough documentaries
4685360	4687280	to know where this is going and I took
4687280	4688840	my hands out of my pocket here on my
4688840	4691000	hand I kept them out and then for two
4691000	4693000	minutes I said nothing because at that
4693000	4694400	point it was like no matter what I say
4694400	4696640	it's gonna be like quicksand yeah more
4696640	4697920	and you go down yeah they were like
4697920	4699480	looking at me and I'm just like like
4699480	4701000	not even looking at them at this point
4701000	4702440	I'm just like looking around and stuff
4702440	4704200	this is where I want to like focus in
4704200	4706640	though yeah like 46 year old white guy
4706640	4709280	huge blind spot doesn't know didn't know
4709280	4711240	until tonight that Benghazi is in Libya
4711240	4715360	etc etc all of this stuff like I as a
4715360	4719000	not just as like a curiosity shop thing
4719000	4721560	but as a transfusion of self-esteem I'm
4721560	4724760	like I want to know at which point are

5037840	5040320	like no one on the bus was talking to me
5040320	5042760	like no one said anything positive or
5042760	5044320	negative which felt like because they
5044320	5046120	also you get taken off and put back on
5046120	5047800	exactly what about the other people just
5047800	5049600	curious that it was you and like three
5049600	5052440	people well I came on the bus another
5052440	5054280	person came on the bus and the third
5054280	5055920	person they took away with them so I
5055920	5057880	have no idea somebody lost the lottery
5057880	5060280	yeah like like and everyone witnessed it
5060280	5061960	yeah it's sitting in a Greyhound bus
5061960	5064760	and everyone was just happy that we're
5064760	5067080	finally moving yeah because I mean like
5067080	5069080	we see this so that the United guy gets
5069080	5071040	stunned baton or somebody like chokes a
5071040	5074000	dog if you're sitting in these seats
5074000	5076320	and then it's very it's very very
5076320	5078120	normalized it's not like this is something
5078120	5079680	like oh yeah we see this every day who
5079680	5081320	cares yeah you know like one person was
5081320	5082600	taken but also like what's the
5082600	5084720	revolution supposed to start what you're
5084720	5087160	not to put your tree you're socialized
5087160	5089680	to go like I my job is to sit here like
5089680	5092480	yeah and then people can well yeah if
5092480	5094000	you hear people on the internet and the
5094000	5096080	responses to my thread everyone was
5096080	5098440	gonna be the hero that day I fuck yeah
5098680	5103280	all of the internet yeah same you'll
5103280	5105920	know why I guess the dust is settled the
5105920	5107640	bus the wheels are rolling you on your
5107640	5109320	way to Portland so yeah because like no
5109320	5110920	one was talking to me I was like it like
5110920	5113520	I have this thing I'm like oh I guess I
5113520	5115280	have to tell people on social media so
5115280	5116800	like I wrote this like whole thread on
5116800	5120360	Twitter and just like describe exactly
5120360	5121720	what I've told everyone like what
5121720	5123240	happened I read the thread is fucking
5123240	5126240	crazy yeah yeah it was just like so I
5126240	5127720	wrote the whole thing posted a picture
5127720	5129320	of like the agents who stopped me and
5129320	5132240	everything just to prove that this thing
5132240	5134680	actually happened because I took a
5134680	5135880	picture of them like when I was like
5135880	5137320	when I got on the bus they were taking a
5137320	5138880	person so I took like snap few pictures
5138880	5140840	of that and like posted that in a tweet
5140840	5145640	as well and then not an hour from that
5145640	5148160	that thread just blew up it was just
5148160	5150520	like going viral like everyone was just
5150520	5151880	like retweeting the whole thing it was
5151880	5155200	just like getting like okay 10k 20k 30k
5155200	5157080	100k I'm like okay I don't know what and
5157080	5158840	then I don't know like getting DMS and
5158840	5160960	emails from like like news agency like
5160960	5162520	everyone like hey can we had you ever
5162520	5164560	had anything like that go that big like
5164560	5166720	on your Twitter before I had a dumb
5166720	5169680	tweet about uber though that got half a
5169680	5171440	million likes and that's like why are
5171440	5174000	you using uber yeah it was a joke about
5174000	5176760	uber which is yeah which is so funny
5176760	5179360	because every like every vital tweet
5179360	5180520	that I write has to do with
5180520	5187240	transportation it was great yeah but
5187240	5190160	but but is there a feeling there or is
5190160	5196200	like like because like a that blowing up
5196200	5200200	that virality yeah is it I don't want to
5200200	5204240	lead the witness and this feeling of
5204240	5206480	like like you're even people that are
5206480	5209920	on your side yeah pushing you yeah that
5209920	5212080	because you became symbolic yeah and
5212080	5214360	you're alone though there's there's
5214360	5217120	you're you're being retweeted because
5217120	5221440	people that want your your experience
5221440	5224800	so that but it just I don't know what
5224800	5226680	to ask you about that I'm just like
5226680	5228840	like like doesn't the fucking world suck
5228840	5231920	the internet like did you like like I
5231920	5234440	get one of my questions is when you sat
5234440	5236040	back on the bus after having that
5236040	5238080	experience what was your feeling but
5238080	5241960	then as those retweets and viral things
5241960	5244520	started coming in I guess I'm leading
5244520	5247040	you to say actually that was worse
5247040	5249400	because that's when people started
5249400	5252280	sticking up for me and that's when shit
5252280	5254840	got abusive yes yes that's very true
5254840	5256480	when I got on the bus I'm not gonna be
5256480	5259040	like oh I was like cool or I was like on
5259040	5260560	the verge of tears like I'm like I was
5260560	5263400	like I was like just so upset and so
5263400	5265440	mad because this thing just happened
5265440	5267200	because it's all like really dehumanizing
5267280	5271040	when like you like like like in my brain
5271040	5272920	I'm like oh I'm like I'm doing all these
5272920	5274440	things and I'm doing comedy and like
5274440	5276080	people like me and stuff and then you
5276080	5277720	have like this one brief moment when
5277720	5279920	you're like is reminded that you're an
5279920	5282560	other and I'm like oh man I tweet this
5282560	5284480	because it's inherently comedic what's
5284480	5286840	my job and exactly yeah were you in
5286840	5288760	instant trouble online like didn't you
5288760	5289960	get like death threats and stuff like
5289960	5291880	that yeah I did and I think one of the
5291880	5293480	reasons like like it was like a lot of
5293480	5295200	like big names just like retweeting it
5295200	5297080	and then I think the point where I got
5297080	5300080	like really big when Alexandria Ocasio
5300080	5302360	Cortez also retweeted it and they like
5302360	5304320	had like and they wrote her thing and I
5304320	5307400	was like holy shit okay this is panic
5307400	5310160	you yeah I was like oh wow okay this is
5310160	5312680	some Congress shit here okay does that
5312680	5314240	make you go like it's out of control
5314240	5316160	like I know when it got to that point I
5316160	5317680	was like okay this is national right now
5317680	5319760	like yeah did you appreciate that or did
5319760	5322880	you think that did you wish that didn't
5322880	5324760	get that much traction I you might get
5324760	5326720	in trouble there are two two parts of me
5326720	5328720	like one part was like as a person I
5328720	5330840	was like I don't need this like I wish
5330840	5332440	that this didn't happen that this is
5332440	5334800	inconvenient but also there was a other
5334800	5337280	part of me was like I'm I'm a person
5337280	5338560	who's like privileged enough to have a
5338560	5340320	platform I'm a person who are privileged
5340320	5341840	enough to you have like a voice and like
5341840	5343320	can speak English well and do all of
5343320	5345640	these things and this thing that happened
5345640	5347920	to me happens all the time exactly
5347920	5350200	exactly I'm like I'm like I like if I
5350200	5352320	don't speak I'm like like this is gonna
5352320	5353520	be a story like it's gonna be thrown
5353520	5355280	away because a lot of people were like
5355280	5358320	surprised that like this happens I had
5358320	5360760	no idea that was happening for the fact
5360760	5363840	that when I somebody I don't know who
5363840	5366480	put that into my eyeballs like someone
5366480	5368000	said you have to read this thread yeah
5368000	5369560	it might have been like Sarah Silverman
5369560	5371840	or whatever like yeah like someone said
5371840	5374280	you have to read this this thread and I
5374280	5376400	read the whole thing and the thing that
5376400	5378640	struck me first and foremost is that oh
5378640	5381880	you have again an audience and yeah a
5381880	5385960	voice yes and you get a lot of eyeballs
5385960	5388840	on your story but this happens to people
5388840	5391280	that don't have they don't any recourse
5391280	5394320	or anything and the fact that you're
5394320	5397400	from Libya you're an asylum seeker you
5397400	5399920	are going through this arduous process
5399920	5404440	and yet you still as an American yeah as
5404440	5407440	far as like like legally like everything
5407440	5409800	is concerned yeah you get to make you
5409800	5412160	get to be made to feel like the other
5412160	5414800	yeah that you get to feel like you don't
5414800	5417600	belong when you absolutely fucking do
5417600	5420040	and then what about the people that
5420040	5421840	don't speak English and don't have any
5421840	5424120	recourse don't have the three thousand
5424120	5425760	dollars to get their shit absolutely
5425760	5428120	yeah absolutely I mean it's like cuz I
5428120	5430480	always I can't get over that person who
5430480	5432560	was taken away because I'm like I he
5432560	5434560	was standing next to me and I don't know
5434560	5436520	if he had papers or not it's the fact
5436520	5438320	that he couldn't even speak English that
5438320	5440040	well so he was he was like being
5440040	5441800	harassed like I don't think he was even
5441800	5444880	like understood what they wanted well
5444880	5447000	and it was like holy shit this is like
5447000	5448920	disgusting and then when I wrote about
5448920	5450640	it like people from Spokane was like
5450640	5452960	this happens all the time greyhound is
5452960	5455080	letting those people both ice and both
5455080	5456800	CBB on the bus all the time they're
5456800	5459440	complicit and they don't have to you
5459440	5461160	don't have to because like there has to
5461160	5462800	be a warrant or something for them to
5462800	5464240	get on the bus under stories about some
5464240	5465520	bus drivers saying now you got to show
5465520	5467320	me some fucking warrant and I think I
5467320	5468880	think that happens sometimes too like
5468880	5470440	what like there was two stories where I
5470440	5472080	read like a bus driver like show me the
5472080	5473840	warrant because you cannot get and then
5473840	5475480	there was this other story with this
5475480	5477680	african-american lady who stood up she
5477680	5480440	was a citizen and when they came in she
5480440	5482200	started like telling people on the bus
5482200	5484440	like don't fucking give them your papers
5484440	5486840	yeah is your fourth amendment right and
5486840	5488320	all of this stuff and they got off the
5488320	5490200	bus so emotionally where does that put
5490200	5491800	you right now in terms of like whether
5491800	5495640	like how do you feel as as a citizen or
5495640	5497480	like your desire to be a citizen here
5497480	5499080	like where does that put oh it does not
5499080	5500920	change my desire by any means because
5500920	5502520	like this is what they want they want me
5502520	5504240	to leave they want me to go away and
5504240	5505960	I'm not fucking doing that and what's
5505960	5508240	because once you're a citizen you're
5508240	5511960	you you have a vote and you have
5511960	5515280	everything I like here's the point
5515280	5517760	here's the thing that I I want to gain
5517760	5520800	from you yeah and it's all about me is
5520800	5525080	like because I I am clearly so fragile
5525080	5528280	so narcissistic so fucking like like
5528280	5532440	entitled I'm not used to this idea of
5532440	5537480	people not wanting me around yeah and I
5537480	5539840	this these times we're living in if not
5539840	5541440	we're all connected and I just like I
5541440	5542960	want to understand I want to get a
5542960	5545240	self-esteem transfusion from you because
5545240	5549360	I don't like I'm just this pud pudgy
5549360	5552960	fucking like I'm like well if you don't
5552960	5554560	like me then I'm gonna go away and all
5554560	5556360	this stuff and I'm like yeah like what
5556360	5558400	does it feel like so you get back on the
5558400	5561040	bus and then you're like texting your
5561040	5562800	girlfriend you're texting people and
5562800	5564240	and you're like kind of pumped I'm
5564240	5566960	familiar with that chapter of outrage
5566960	5570480	and and like alienation yeah but what
5570480	5572240	I've never been able to cope with is
5572240	5575200	that other chapter where you tweet and
5575200	5576760	you go this just happened to me and
5576760	5580480	people start saying like fuck you yeah
5580480	5582800	who the fuck are you why the fucker is
5582800	5585280	your name in my fucking Twitter
5585280	5587240	absolutely yeah well I wish you would
5587240	5590560	fucking die like absolutely yeah I it's
5590560	5592320	not as simple as asking you like how do
5592320	5593800	you cope with that because I've asked
5593800	5595040	that of a million people and they all
5595040	5597960	go I just don't think about it yeah I
5597960	5599920	mean it's I'm not gonna be like lie and
5599920	5601720	be like oh that was like easy to deal
5601720	5603200	with it obviously like something like
5603200	5605160	it's it's definitely hurtful and we're
5605160	5607120	like kind of like you kind of like like
5607120	5609560	I wish that wasn't happening like it but
5609560	5611960	it doesn't make me personally like it
5611960	5613520	doesn't make me feel sad they were
5613520	5615960	saying this stuff about me it makes me
5615960	5617760	sad I'm like there are some people who
5617760	5620240	are like that violent out horrible I'm
5620240	5622160	like I'm just like in some sense I'm
5622160	5625000	like I feel so bad for you too that you
5625000	5626600	this is how you like this is how you
5626600	5628640	lead your life I can't get there yeah
5628640	5630800	every day this has always been the thing
5630800	5633960	is that racism is not it seems like it's
5633960	5635720	an incredible accomplishment to those
5635720	5638520	who wish to practice it yeah they are so
5638520	5643720	impressed they are so impressed by their
5643720	5646160	systemic racism they think that this
5646160	5648800	thing that they've built is so awful and
5648800	5653000	it is awful it sucks yeah but it is not
5653000	5656200	very smart it's not very efficient it's
5656200	5658440	not the best way to do anything so the
5658440	5660680	way that we who are oppressed feel about
5660680	5663920	it is like it's a fucking mat exactly
5663920	5666040	it goes by your ear it doesn't stop your
5666040	5667520	spirituality it's certain doesn't
5667520	5668960	certainly doesn't stop you from rising
5668960	5671320	up yeah it's just this inconvenience it's
5671320	5674320	like racism is like people taking the
5674320	5677200	steps out of a set of steps you know
5677200	5679200	you're gonna get where you're going you
5679200	5680760	just can't believe a motherfucker would
5680760	5685800	build like that I can't believe these
5685800	5689200	stairs have to go around this guy's
5689200	5694040	guitar pool we're friends with Paul
5694040	5696240	Feige Paul Feige has a new thing with
5696800	5698800	with his powder keg thing called break
5698800	5702560	the room yeah and then you have a deal
5702560	5706280	with with him yeah we'll break the room oh yeah let's talk about that what is the break the room
5706280	5709040	initiative yeah I mean like we're writing a
5709040	5711640	story that revolves around my like my
5711640	5714160	life and my like kind of like the person
5714160	5716400	of color experience to being in in in
5716400	5720400	Portland and it's kind of focusing more
5720400	5722760	of like being a person of color like a
5722760	5725000	refugee or an immigrant in a in a place
5725000	5729640	that is like hyper liberal in a liberal
5729640	5731600	bubble that thinks is like the perfect
5731600	5734880	utopia and yet is 90% and yeah it's the
5734880	5736400	show is gonna be gonna be like kind of
5736400	5738520	like an anti-portlandia kind of thing
5738520	5741800	or just like this is what you don't see
5741800	5744000	in Portland yeah look at all of these
5744000	5746640	people and like their experiences and
5746640	5748320	stuff because it's definitely an
5748320	5751040	experience that we mean like yes I do
5751040	5752600	have my own struggle and I have my own
5752600	5754920	stuff but also like a lot of people in
5755160	5757000	like of color who live in Portland they
5757000	5758920	share the same experience of just being
5758920	5762160	like a place where it gets too liberal
5762160	5763720	that you're like silenced all the time
5763720	5766640	because you're reminded of like no this
5766640	5768960	is this is great like what do you mean
5768960	5770800	this is not good this is like the best
5770800	5773280	way I can describe it is like that the
5773280	5777160	that showed at the good place where they
5777160	5778520	think that they're in the good place and
5778520	5779800	everyone like this is heaven this is
5779800	5782200	really great and then and then at the
5782200	5783800	ending like oh this is the bad place
5783800	5785720	this has been held this whole time oh
5785720	5789440	god no one else who cares yes three
5789440	5793160	seasons now yeah I mean I guess they're
5793160	5796520	giving seasons away these days you know
5796520	5799680	in my day you had to retain 90% of the
5799680	5801600	office's audience you were fucking out
5801600	5803800	you were back to all right that's right
5803800	5807200	continue yeah the Portland like for all
5807200	5809000	of its hyper liberalism is still like a
5809000	5811560	very white very kind of closet is like
5811560	5814160	I mean cost of rather like yeah it is a
5814160	5816000	different type of racism that you deal
5816000	5818040	with it's passive-aggressive racism
5818040	5819560	that's what you deal with you can you
5819560	5821680	can feel like an outsider in a very
5821680	5824600	liberal absolutely absolutely yeah how
5824600	5826360	does that daily play out like like what's
5826360	5828320	what's the day-to-day things that
5828320	5830040	happened to you that where you are
5830040	5833240	reminded that you're the other it is
5833240	5834800	sometimes like when you're like trying
5834800	5837240	to go like by by your day and then
5837240	5839000	someone has to bring up something that
5839000	5842640	they saw on the news I'd be like cuz like
5842640	5844480	I leave like I wake up every day like I
5844480	5846640	surprised don't think about what
5846640	5848760	happening in Libya every day it's just
5848760	5850080	like I try not to think about it because
5850080	5851680	I'm like I left that place so I'm like
5851680	5854040	it's I'm proud to be from there I love
5854040	5856080	it so much automatically America yeah
5856080	5857880	exactly yeah like I don't give a fuck
5857880	5860160	fuck these bastards I haven't thought about Libya
5860160	5862560	those poor bastards in three years I'm American
5862560	5867440	yeah even water for Hillary anyway and then and then
5867440	5869800	you have those people I'm like that
5869800	5871720	come to you like oh my god so I read
5871720	5873440	this thing about Libya today and I'm
5873440	5875720	like really sorry like this is must be
5875720	5878000	so terrible like that's me that's what
5878000	5880720	I yeah like like that's me if I'm
5880720	5882320	bartending where you drink and I know
5882320	5883880	you're from Libya you're really doing
5883880	5886000	you're being Portland right now yeah but
5886000	5888400	yeah so but that's annoying it's because
5888400	5889920	it's like yeah looking at you as an
5889920	5891640	immigrant exactly because like there's
5891640	5893840	like to like there's like two narratives
5893840	5895400	for immigrants like I thought you were
5895400	5897320	a tie-in when you came on stage a lot
5897320	5900360	of people think that yeah there's like
5900360	5901720	two narratives it comes to immigrants
5901720	5902840	because like you have the Republican
5902840	5904480	side who are like you're vilified every
5904480	5907000	day you suck leave and then you have
5907000	5909240	like liberals or which is mostly like no
5909240	5911400	matter what you do do like sometimes you
5911400	5913760	want you to be the victim so bad like
5913760	5915880	like it doesn't let you rise because you
5915880	5917560	can't leave because they want to make
5917560	5919640	you feel like you need that help all the
5919640	5921480	time and once you break through I'm
5921480	5923880	like I'm doing it and they're like yeah
5923880	5925720	but you're not a citizen so good luck
5925720	5928000	with that yeah I just have to kind of
5928000	5929720	take you down a bit like I feel like
5929720	5931280	you're trying to run away from us you
5931280	5933320	don't need our help we have to help you
5933320	5935520	every step of the way because you need
5935520	5937080	us you need us so much it's just like
5937080	5938880	this like white savior kind of thing
5938880	5940560	they're just like I'm like I don't need
5940560	5942920	you I can I can do this on my own and
5942920	5945080	also like a word for us we're socialized
5945080	5947480	to feel that way it's not easy yeah
5947480	5949800	absolutely we're told that we're in
5949800	5951640	charge of the world we're in sixth grade
5951640	5953400	and then we're like turned out loose
5953400	5955320	into this world that we don't run yeah
5955320	5957680	I and we're like where are you everybody
5957680	5959520	come on and they're like fuck you and
5959520	5962680	we're like okay yeah you're racist yeah
5962680	5970280	it's very hard to be charged I'm in
5970280	5972360	charge of everything all the time when I
5972360	5975840	hate it I created a Plymouth Rock that
5975840	5978880	I couldn't lift I want to help you
5978880	5984000	Brandon but you're not poor enough yeah
5984000	5988240	that is it I mean it's I that's one of
5988240	5990520	the many things that I'm like that idea
5990520	5992920	of like when you if you're a white
5992920	5996600	American and you encounter someone that
5996600	6003440	you perceive as extrinsic in any way
6003440	6005800	whether it's by accent complexion or
6005800	6009640	whatever the the most liberal component
6009640	6011600	of the white American I'm speaking for
6011600	6013960	myself has this like impulse to be like
6013960	6016520	I'm gonna be an engine of understanding
6016520	6018040	and connection and the way I'm gonna
6018040	6020080	express that is I'm gonna ask you where
6020080	6022040	are you from and when you say Portland
6022040	6024960	I'm gonna go no really where and that
6024960	6026760	we're waking up into this world where
6026760	6030120	actually that's you like fucking up and
6030120	6034320	how would you like to it's like a I'm
6034320	6038440	done talking but I ask you like how go

6064120	6065280	trying to get to the United States is

6077040	6078480	to help I'm not like involved in like
6078480	6080440	any bigger organization or something but
6080440	6083000	I'm like I'm willing to like there's so
6083000	6084640	so many organizations important stuff
6084640	6086640	that would like reach out to me to like
6086640	6088520	like what's the best way to help and I
6088520	6090040	like I'm like I'm not them out what's
6090040	6091840	that can you shout them out there is
6091840	6094080	there's one organization called Erco
6094080	6096840	that does a lot of help there's also
6096840	6098480	mercy course that like located in
6098480	6100120	Portland they do a lot of work to would
6100120	6102000	like refugees and immigrants do those
6102000	6103800	to organization mostly like do a lot of
6103800	6105680	work to help especially like when once
6105680	6107600	you're here they kind of like they like
6107600	6110160	how do you that can be funded because
6110160	6111960	actually it occurs to me yeah we need to
6111960	6114200	update our yeah Erika is definitely a
6114200	6117200	place that once a month we
6117920	6123360	it's I are CEO I RCO yes is anyone up
6123360	6125680	there less drunk and paying attention I
6125680	6127480	don't know like like one of the what's
6127480	6129400	your favorite one like if you I would
6129400	6131600	go with that for sure yeah because this
6131600	6133400	this helps like people like and they and
6133400	6135320	they also provide like a lot of like
6135320	6137480	immigrants like we're like even like

6148000	6150760	did you love that you learn shrink yeah
6150760	6153200	did you choose Portland because that was
6153200	6155000	a city that was amenable to that
6155000	6158600	refugee process or no I didn't I didn't
6158600	6159720	pick Portland for that because the
6159720	6162520	program I was on they picked Portland
6162520	6165280	State University for the program so after
6165280	6166720	the program was done I was like well I'm
6166720	6168480	important now and I like at least I know
6168480	6171160	a few people and right now like just
6171160	6174360	like today like Monday are you still
6174360	6176360	getting hate are you still getting like
6176360	6179640	threatened and stuff like where did your
6179640	6180960	status like in terms of your own
6180960	6183480	comfort being here go up or down or
6183480	6185760	where are you at right now now it's it's
6185760	6190360	kind of like in the middle honestly
6190360	6193360	answer the question it is it was
6193360	6194720	answering a question I asked no it is in
6194720	6196520	the middle because it feels like some
6196520	6198200	days it goes up and I'm like oh
6198200	6200040	everything is is great and it is taken
6200040	6201800	down like just to go back to your
6201800	6203080	question like about helping and stuff
6203080	6205080	the reason that sometimes it is taken
6205080	6206600	down because like oh like we're doing
6206600	6208240	well and then like oh travel ban and
6208240	6210760	Libya is on it and then like people can't
6210760	6212160	come in the country and like my family
6212160	6213480	can't come visit I can't leave the
6213480	6214720	country just like we're like stuck in
6214720	6216400	the situation that's just like what do
6216400	6219840	we do and then some days it goes up
6219840	6221280	because like something like some things
6221280	6223680	happen and we're like oh like someone
6223680	6225080	cared someone like did something like
6225080	6226840	that and it's just like you can like
6226840	6229760	have more hope more like and then
6229760	6233200	something that this like ice and CPB
6233200	6235320	things happen and you're like oh fuck
6235320	6237600	this like is it like this is I hate all
6237600	6239320	of this so is there light at the end of
6239320	6241360	that tunnel for you like is there like
6241360	6242840	do you see a place where you go like
6242840	6245080	okay I'm full-on citizen nobody nobody
6245080	6246960	can fuck with me anymore or or is that
6246960	6248280	just gonna always be a thing for you
6248280	6250000	here it's always gonna be a thing like
6250000	6252280	it's like as a person of color like you
6252280	6254120	get a citizenship and what what does
6254120	6256080	that mean like you're not you like in
6256080	6258640	the eyes of of some Americans you're
6258640	6260560	never gonna be a true American because
6260560	6262640	you're just you're just different you
6262640	6265000	you have an accent you you you you're a
6265000	6266360	person of color you're black you're like
6266360	6268320	you're just like you're never you're
6268320	6269920	never them you're never gonna be them
6269920	6271440	and you can have an HBO special and you
6271440	6273720	can still be it the other you can still
6273720	6275120	be the other and like to bring it back
6275120	6277360	to where we add the the whole beginning
6277360	6278920	like with this thing with the with that
6278920	6281600	rapper 21 Savage like like this is a
6281600	6283560	bullshit this is a person who has
6283560	6286360	contributed so much to the community has
6286360	6289240	done like is is super famous and then
6289240	6291120	has the thing happened to them and like
6291120	6294000	last night at the Grammys one person
6294000	6296320	mentioned them and it was a Swedish
6296320	6298400	producer I'm like I'm like what about
6298400	6299960	all of these people like this guy is
6299960	6302040	nominated and he's not there and not a
6302040	6304280	single person would talk about like
6304280	6305800	because they don't want to make it
6305800	6307320	political while like someone's just
6307320	6309380	wearing build the wall thing on the red
6309380	6311240	carpet it's just like it's just like
6311240	6312960	yeah they weren't really concerned with
6312960	6314440	him until he started doing children's
6314440	6316720	programs in Atlanta exactly that's one
6316720	6318280	of the reasons that were super pissed is
6318280	6321160	that yeah it's not it's not just a guy
6321160	6322960	it's literally a guy who came to the
6322960	6324480	United States made money in the United
6324480	6326680	States and then gave back in ways that
6326680	6328920	citizens don't yeah and like you see the
6328920	6330400	government part of it and then you see
6330400	6332480	the citizens part of it like how does
6332480	6336400	this person move from there to having
6336400	6339400	some like nobody's just being like he
6339400	6341440	only stay in his visa he must go like
6341440	6343480	what do you know about immigration laws
6343480	6345720	to say also what have you contributed to
6345720	6347440	this country like if we were like take
6347440	6349000	it by contribution like most of the
6349000	6350400	people will be gone like you've done
6350400	6352720	exactly right we all need to be more
6352720	6354720	easily triggered by that shit I mean not
6354720	6357100	to be corny but that old poem about like
6357100	6358720	first they came for so-and-so and then
6358720	6360600	they came for a lot and it's like that's
6360600	6362880	my narcissistic nightmare there is a
6362880	6367560	path from narcissism to patriotism to
6367560	6371000	actually defending the the fucking line
6371000	6373480	where it's like actually I don't want
6373480	6376520	to be the guy that is responsible I
6376520	6378840	don't want to be standing on my front
6378840	6381800	porch having everything up to me please

6392120	6394760	even be a little bit racist my my
6394760	6398800	grandfather was 17 years old and he you
6398800	6401240	gotta there's absolutely no way that
6401240	6403400	the reason he lied about his age to go
6403400	6405960	off and bayonet people in World War Two
6405960	6412760	is because he hated racism he hated
6412760	6417760	fascism he hated the idea that being my
6417760	6420000	grandpa wouldn't be up to him one day
6420000	6423080	he was selfish enough narcissistic
6423080	6425600	enough even misogynistic and sexist
6425600	6427320	enough to take up a bayonet and go
6427320	6429120	actually finally there's a bad guy I
6429120	6432400	can identify with it like like fuck
6432400	6434400	god damn it Harmon you got drunk and you
6434400	6439040	started in your shit I anyways how are
6439040	6441400	you what are you a Pisces are you a Pisces
6441400	6446080	Dan I'm actually a person have a have a
6446080	6448840	nap one thing I wanted to ask you which
6448840	6450800	may put you in the spot is after all of
6450800	6453080	this it's like it's like you're a person
6453080	6455520	that has no experience that is parallel
6455520	6458640	to mine yeah and I'm curious because
6458640	6462520	meanwhile I'm like there's absolutely
6462520	6464400	break dancing there's no synchronicity
6464400	6466600	between our like like rhythms of like
6466600	6468280	well first sometimes you're poppin
6468280	6469400	sometimes you're locked sometimes you're
6469400	6470960	popping a locket right and I'm kind of
6470960	6474200	like like I'm I'm almost twice your age
6474200	6477760	and I'm wondering like what is your
6477760	6479720	feeling about the construct called
6479720	6482680	America you can decline to answer that
6482680	6484280	question oh yeah I can answer it yeah
6484280	6487440	lady I mean like the the the concept
6487440	6489560	like on paper is great like if you see
6489560	6491400	it this is the perfect nation but then
6491400	6494600	in practice most of the things that this
6494600	6497280	country preaches is is not practice is
6497280	6498680	mostly practice in like the other
6498680	6500520	countries for some reason they're doing
6500520	6502000	it while they're taking those American
6502000	6503800	ideals in the American dream are there
6503800	6505440	and they're doing it across the world
6505440	6508640	yeah which is not necessarily a huge
6508640	6511920	irony I like like I heard this NPR
6511920	6514720	special that I was like hammering on I
6514720	6517040	don't even I don't even understand what
6517040	6518960	the truly I guess I'll listen back and
6518960	6526920	I'll find out why yeah you do I can't
6526920	6529320	wait to I mean what is the problem go
6529320	6534080	on okay I go ahead will you mark this
6534080	6535640	and you'll listen to this point you'll
6535640	6537360	I mean I'm paying attention I want to
6537360	6539080	mark this point and so you're listening
6539080	6541120	right now yes as a sober person and
6541120	6543040	you're listening to the podcast correct
6543040	6545200	because you're going you're listening to

6552560	6554520	narcissism and and you're fucking
