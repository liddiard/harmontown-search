0	15880	It was March 29th. How's everybody doing tonight? God bless you. Welcome to Harman Town, everybody.
15880	20080	Thank you so much for coming out on a... What night is tonight? Saturday? Friday? What the fuck is it?
20080	26760	Saturday. Saturday night in Hollywood, California. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman
26760	46000	Town, Mr. Dan Harman. Thank you. Thank you. You're applauding yourselves. You're applauding
46000	55480	yourselves. It's a special, it's a special night at Harman Town because, oh, I just realized they
55600	61880	were reacting to the sash. No, they were reacting to that dynamic intro I just gave you. This is one
61880	67560	of many reasons why it's a special night is because one of our fans made sashes for us.
67560	80800	Aren't they smart? It wasn't a girl, so retract your awws. It was a dude. Prepare your... Dan,
80800	93360	Brian. Is he pretending not to know your name? It's my middle name. Brian? Please do not feel
93360	99040	obligated to wear these. I just came across them and couldn't resist. That's actually only funny
99040	106840	if you realize that they say Harman Town on them as well. I stepped on your joke. That's American
106840	115640	Sean Sakame, AKA Snap the Jap. One of the most offensively named fans that we have. The delightfully
115640	123480	racist sash maker. Anna Marie Von Furley, could you please come up here as an expert sasher and
123480	131120	sash Jeff with his comptroller sash. Jeff Davis is the comptroller of Harman Town. Seems like a good
131120	141920	time to give him a round of applause. I love it. I've never felt more in comptroller in my life.
141920	149880	How is everybody doing? Are you guys doing good? Sorry, I didn't mean to... You could have... I'm
149880	156200	sorry. I instinctively did this. I was like, don't let someone manipulate you. It's a curious thing
156200	161080	about Harman Town is I just want to protect the flock and sometimes I'll hurt them by doing it.
161840	167320	I went to see Jesus Christ Superstar in New York and I was very taken with how whiny and passive
167320	174280	aggressive Jesus was. I really liked that musical very much for that reason. The actor that played
174280	179000	Jesus or the role itself? The role itself. I think it's written in a very whiny. It's like Judas is
179000	184400	the good role, the juicy role. That's the manly like protagonist role. It's a tragic hero and
184400	189840	Jesus Christ Superstar. But the role of Jesus is like, he really is like constantly complaining
189840	195120	about being Jesus. It's a big bummer for him and no one understands. He's just constantly standing
195120	201560	up and going, if you guys had to deal with what I had to deal with, forget it. You know what,
201560	206120	if I vanished right now, no one would even care. Then the chorus would be like, oh, what do you
206120	214280	mean? Don't say that. Hey, come on. Hey, buddy. Passive aggressive savior. You would be. I'm not
214280	221400	taking a dig at either the mythical Jesus, the archeological Jesus, or a rice and a Schwarzkopf.
221400	226520	What were their names? Rice and Schwarzkopf. Jesus Christ Superstar, Andrew Blake Webber,
226520	234400	and Rice Arroni. I want to know more about the archeological Jesus. They found Jesus. Well,
234400	241320	the cool thing about him is that he didn't even believe in God. He just packed a six shooter and
241640	246680	that was enough religion for him. You know what a practical man I am.
250200	256360	Indie reference. We went on the Disneyland indie ride. Let's not start with the tangents just yet.
257880	262120	Can we just, can we please center ourselves because that was the, okay, we got our sashes.
262120	269160	That was reason number one. It's a special night. Yeah. And I want to be very
269880	276280	characteristically self-diagnostic and neurotic and say, when I say special, I don't mean good.
276280	280520	I'm not saying tonight's going to be the best Harmon town, but it's the most special because
280520	284520	I've decided because I'm not going to bother to look because I'm lazy that this is our year
284520	292840	anniversary. It feels like it feels good enough. It might've been last week we had to do two Harmon
292840	298440	towns this month because my firing is like, it's just my body is partly loose change. And some
299000	306520	extra people are gathering it, which is fine. I have no problem with that. There's a fracas.
308600	314760	Those people are already regretting their $10 ticket purchase. There is nothing interesting
314760	322040	for me to say. I am Ace Rothstein in late act two of casino, just smoking and like,
322040	329080	and another thing, Mr. Governor. Uh, I am a third act. Uh, uh, what's his name? Uh,
329080	334600	I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Uh, what's the guy that died a heroin?
334600	343000	Lenny Bruce. I'm third act Lenny Bruce. So I think, I think Dan, within the last three shows,
343000	347160	you've started off the show by one time comparing yourself to Michelangelo. Right.
348040	353480	I'm pretty sure Einstein. Right. And now tonight, Lenny Bruce. No, no, no. Thomas Edison is the
353480	358280	middle one. All right. Sorry. I hate it when you get shit wrong. I'm a perfectionist. Sorry.
358920	364360	That's what this shows about. Now I woke up this morning and, uh, I realized I have nothing to do.
364360	367960	And, uh, I thought that tonight could be a special night that we would not know what we were doing
367960	373880	as I stepped onto stage. We rarely do. I don't come up with desk bits. I don't have articles that are,
374680	383960	are too crazy to be true. Uh, I have a, I have a few thoughts and impulses, but tonight is about
383960	389320	weightlessness. And I don't just mean cause I've lost upwards of 14 pounds on the four hour body
389320	399000	diet. Wow. You found a way to make it about you. In the middle of a story, all heroes meet with a
399000	404520	goddess. They, uh, they, they, they find themselves at a, a nexus. Give us an example. Give us a couple
404520	412280	of film examples of a real genius. Uh, with Val Kilmer, uh, in the middle of the movie,
412840	417720	right in the middle of the story, Val Kilmer has a little ketchup dab on his lip and he's
417720	421720	like listening to the guy that lived in the closet. He's going, they, they, they, for the first half
421720	426760	of real genius with Val Kilmer, they're working on a laser project to get their A from William
426840	431320	Atherton, I believe, who states very clearly in the first act that he hates popcorn.
433240	437320	He couldn't be clearer about his hatred of popcorn. Does that come back to bite him in the ass?
437320	443880	Actually, you know what it does. The weirdest thing is the movie ends with a giant popcorn.
443880	448600	Did he turn his house into a big jiffy pop? He did. They did. It took genius to do it,
448600	453960	but they did. But that's not important. He's their teacher and they're working on a laser
453960	458120	project. They have to make this laser and then the middle of the movie, they make the laser.
458840	463640	And then, uh, uh, Val Kilmer is eating French fries and, uh, he's got a little dollop of
463640	467480	ketchup on his lip and the, uh, the crazy guy from the basement. You remember,
467480	474120	yeah, he lived in the pipes in the basement of the campus. And, uh, and he says to them,
474120	478520	yeah, you made your laser. What do you think it's for? What's the, what do you think, uh,
478520	481800	the government's going to use that laser for? And there's a shot of Val Kilmer going,
482360	487400	and he's got like a little ketchup on his lip from eating French fries and the 80s needle drop
487400	494200	like swells, you know, some, some, some blazer clad band, like kind of hits their crescendo, uh,
494200	500760	as we truck on his face. And, and, and then the second half of real genius proceeds because at
500760	505400	the, at the nexus, that is the goddess, the hero has achieved everything that he could possibly
505400	509080	achieve. And now he has to figure out what he's going to do with it. Am I just going to stand here
509160	515240	with ketchup on my lip? We've been doing a year of Harmontown shows. We've achieved the freedom
515240	519400	to do what we want to go to the moon. And we've got ketchup all over our lips. We haven't done
519400	524040	anything. So I want to take tonight to really recalibrate and figure out what we're doing.
524040	527960	So we started off with this kind of, you know, premise that this was going to be about perfecting
527960	533000	society, that we were going to find a way to where we're going to colonize the moon and take
533000	536840	the people that come to Harmontown. We're going to, we're going to figure out society's problems
536840	540920	and like go and, you know, like make our own civilization out there. But we,
540920	543960	we had a couple guests to start off with and we just kind of dropped that. Now we just talk about
543960	551080	your hemorrhoids and your, your bubble baths and things like that. So have there been any tweets
551080	557560	or anything that I think I have to grab a drink. Could you read my brother's email? Well, yeah,
557560	564280	absolutely. Oh, fuck it. I think we get lots of repeat customers. Who has not been here before by
564280	574600	applause. So many of you are familiar with Dan's brother, Bones Harmon, right? Yeah. His name is
574600	580440	Doug, but he goes by various nicknames throughout his life. Bones. At one point he was, he was
580440	587240	Dart Vader because he liked darts and he made his family call him Dart Vader. What were some
587240	593160	other ones? My favorite part in his development, he was like 15 and I was 10. He started hanging
593160	599160	out at a pool hall down the block from my mom's place. And he got 15 years old. He got really
599160	605800	into billiards. Well, they had also like a space ace machine and a pengo. And he decided that he
605800	613000	was really into billiards. So he went and got his own billiard cue and that you kind of swivel
613000	619560	together so that he could play people in pool and have his own pool cue. And he also got a iron on
619560	631400	letter sweatshirt that said pool shark. That was his identity. Pool shark. The drawing room is
631400	635240	like our favorite little local shithole watering hole. And they have a dart board there. And this
635240	639720	dart champion, they actually have a league there. It's one of those electronic machines. It's not
639720	644680	like a regular horsehair quality board, but it's one of those electronic machines. And people come
644680	648360	in and they take it very seriously. And I played a guy there. I'm not great at darts. I'm okay at
648360	652520	darts. But if I see somebody, there was a guy that came in and he had a tank top on and it was
652520	659080	not hot. It was wintertime in Los Angeles. It was chilly out. Like it was cold in the bar. Bars are
659080	663240	generally kind of, you know, the air conditioning is on. The tank top was more there just to let you
663240	670120	know that on both of his shoulders, he had tattoos of darts. And he was a piece of shit at the dart
670120	675080	board. And I beat him with absolute happiness and arrogance. So yeah, you don't fucking put darts
675080	679800	in your arm. And if you do, be the world's greatest dart player. And if you lose and you have
679800	685160	tattoos of darts, be cooler about it. We played for a drink and I beat him twice and he fucked
685160	690200	off into the night. Never fucking bought me that drink. Well, let's have a guest reader come up.
691720	697560	Who in the first few rows, like, just show your hands if you feel that maybe you were in high
697560	702920	school forensics. You feel like you have an okay handle on kind of cold reading. Or maybe you
703000	706840	weren't. And maybe this is the time to, you know, to try your hand at public speaking,
706840	711480	you know, if you just, I'm pouring sweat. I'm like a fucking like Harlem jazz. You know what?
713480	719720	Those sashes don't breathe, man. Snap the Jap. Your, your sash is as constrictive as the
720520	722600	untoward racial tension of your name.
722600	729960	What's his real name? Sean Sakame.
729960	735720	Sean, show yourself. Is he even here? Oh, there he is. Oh, Sean. All right. Yeah, there he is.
741400	748840	Nicely done. Next time make sashes for everybody. Do we need music? Should I be looking up a song
748840	753240	to play for the background? Can you play something soft? Like something mellow and like, like, okay,
753240	759320	let me, let me find something. So I'm kind of like, is there a male performer here who is capable of
759320	766920	cold reads? Yeah. Okay. What's your name, sir? Adam. All right. Hold up one second. I have to,
766920	769880	I have to find the song. You guys get to know each other. I'm going to find a song.
773000	776600	Oh, really? Oh, puberty is hitting you quickly.
776840	783960	I'm waiting for puberty. Oh, okay. He was one of Chang's bodyguards in the, the place I used to work.
792360	798280	I think I got the song. I don't know what email, what email this is, but I should be very ambient.
799160	802520	This is just an email from my brother. I don't know if this will wash, but all right. I'll do
802520	813240	my best. The subject is you sucking. Okay. June. Wait, wait, wait, wait for the music. Wait for
813240	829240	the music. Regarding you sucking June 3rd, 2012, 4 20 a.m. I wanted mom and dad to meet their
829240	834280	granddaughter. So we've had a couple visits. Thought I'd let you know once an hour. Mom
834280	839320	mentions how smart you are. I'm not exactly sure of the equation, but anyhow, my daughter is smart
839320	844040	because you read books when you were her age. Does no one else remember that I read high school
844040	849880	level books when I was in grade school? Anyway, she said someone put you in the closet with books.
850760	858200	I hope it wasn't too scary. And I'm proud you made it out of the closet. Thank you for my
858200	864120	daughter's brain and thanks for emailing once in a while. You drooling dick puddle of chimp semen.
866200	871800	P.S., you know, you think if you think about it, I'm smarter than you are because I smoked pot and
871800	877240	dropped out of high school. You didn't smoke pot and put dropout until college. Why can't a brother
877240	885480	get any cred around here? P.P.S. mom is worried about your liver. I think she'd feel better if
885480	896440	you smoked more dope and drank less vodka just a heads up scent from my eyebone. Adam or Adam? Adam.
901160	903720	That was a good musical selection. What is that? La Vie en Rose.
903720	916440	All right. So let's just focus and become weightless and take a step back. I did do my
916440	922280	brother proud today and I did get wailing high. I really did because I cleaned out my whole house
922280	929400	and I found my old bong from when I was 25. And I went and I bought some screens. You misplaced
929400	940920	a bong for 13 years. I was really high. Remember that. That's where it is. Jeff found a note on
940920	944360	my on a whiteboard in my apartment once and I was living in this one bedroom apartment in
945160	950840	Las Feliz and we were both getting high. That's okay to say, right? We both have prescriptions.
950840	957480	Not me. Okay. Well, as a person with a prescription, Jeff is very nauseous and
957480	964680	sleep deprived all the time. So you found this whiteboard thing and it said,
965240	971560	dear, not high Dan, don't get high so much. It makes you feel like you're going to have a heart
971560	978920	attack signed high Dan. It was right down like a refrigerator board. I was just wandering around
978920	983000	to the apartment and there it was. I read that and like, let's forward thinking. Then at the time,
983720	989640	in a gata divida was playing, I was high. I was like walking around like, and Jeff said,
989640	995240	what's with this? It's a note. And I was like, and Jeff's like, so what's the deal? I'm not going
995240	1002440	to listen to that guy. He was high. It's a real story. It really happened. Other wonderful things
1002440	1006840	happened in that apartment. Like the time that I was living with this girl, Dawn, wonderful young
1006840	1016760	lady. I was putting on a true Patriot. She was in the bathroom, like brushing her hair
1019720	1028360	or, or, or studying for her LSAT ladies. I don't want to create like a stereotype of my story.
1028360	1033160	So there was, there may have been a book there too. I just, it just sounded weird to say,
1033960	1039880	the truth is she was primping in the, in the bathroom. And, and I, I, I, it was a tiny little
1039880	1045400	apartment and I, I saw her in the bathroom and I said, I'm not making this story short at all.
1045400	1051880	I said, I'm going to go eat something. And she said, okay, and get brush your hair. And I walked
1051880	1056760	into the kitchenette and I started doing, as I do, I started singing a little song to myself.
1057720	1061960	And it was a falsetto kind of song. It was because I was grabbing a little plate instead
1061960	1079800	of a big plate. So I started singing. That's all I was doing. It was like, I was a choir boy.
1079800	1086680	It was just sort of like, I like the kind of strange Gregorian diminished fourths.
1086680	1091400	We all do this. We all, we all sing little ditties and then kind of get focused on one.
1091480	1096920	I was kind of into it. And the whole time I had a mental map of where I was and where my girlfriend
1096920	1102120	was. She was in the bathroom, uh, uh, doing something. And I was just singing this song and
1102120	1107880	my back was to the doorway of the kitchenette. And as I turned around, I saw her, she had heard me
1107880	1112200	singing in this falsetto voice and she had decided to not, she didn't want to disturb anything,
1112200	1118200	but she wanted to listen to the song. She was like Jane Goodall. So she was crouched,
1118280	1127240	crouched behind the stove. Day seven behavior. She had become so amused that her face was bright
1127240	1131240	red and she was like, cause she was trying out to laugh cause she was just listening to this stupid
1131240	1135800	song. And so I turned around and she had been doing that the whole time. And when I saw her,
1135800	1142760	I'm holding a plate and I went, but more feminine than that, more like, like weird,
1142840	1148200	like more Damon Wayans, like, like senior, like in an eighties movie where it's like,
1151000	1155560	and the plate went flying. But it's very difficult to describe this cause it's like,
1155560	1161880	it's like a photon becomes a, a feet on and a glue on the bonds with a neon. And it all happens
1161880	1166680	at the center of the universe at the same time because I went and she had been crouched down
1167560	1171480	and then she, she, she was suppressing her laughter. So when I did that, she went
1175560	1180360	so I all from my perspective, I turned around, saw something that scared me and it turned out
1180360	1185640	to be my girlfriend who was crouched like a hobgoblin bright red and making like this weird
1185640	1193240	hobgoblin face. So I, I, as I recovered from my adrenaline shock, I went, what are you doing? And
1194200	1200440	she answered in the moment and went, I'm peeing because I had made her laugh so hard. She was
1200440	1207400	peeing. So then I, this is the part that I swear I have to swear is true. And I could,
1207400	1212840	I have witnesses to the evidence that made me laugh so hard. I shit my pants.
1215000	1220200	People hear that story. They go, why aren't you married? Uh, because that's enough for a whole
1220200	1224120	just, just keep on. It doesn't matter. But the epilogue is Dino comes over, right? Well,
1224120	1228680	that's the reason I remember it oddly, because Dino came over and he said, I don't know. It's
1228680	1235800	just like, I just, it all, how often do you shit your pants? More often than I, yeah, actually,
1235800	1242120	it happens more often probably than you have forgettable pants pooping stories. Yeah, I do.
1242120	1246680	I mean, I, I could tell you the ones I remember, but I also feel there's probably a bunch where
1246680	1257720	I'm like, ah, fuck, I shit my pants. It doesn't happen to you. It'll happen at the weirdest times.
1257720	1262200	Like I'll just, it always, it's always the story is always after. Well, before you're, you know,
1262200	1266120	before eight, it just happens because it happens and we really have to give children a mark,
1266120	1270760	make a note of this. We have to give children a break on this. They're not choosing to shit
1270760	1275560	their pants. They have the little muscles. I didn't poop my pants a lot. Uh, but after eight
1275560	1281480	from eight to 39, it's always just, you think it's a fart. That's it. It's every story. I just
1281480	1284760	think it's a fart. It feels same as a fart. And I just got like, well, this is going to be great.
1287960	1293000	The worst one was in, you gambled and lost. Yeah. Well, I mean, it never seems like a gamble.
1293000	1298920	There's no double zero on the roulette wheel. You know, there's no purpose of like, well,
1298920	1304120	why would I shit my pants? I'm not sick. I didn't, I didn't eat a fucking truck full of
1304920	1312680	wheat. Uh, whatever makes you shit. I don't know. The opposite of cheese. I kept thinking the
1312680	1317720	app. What's the opposite of cheese? Oh my God. I, I just shit my pants. Why? I just,
1317720	1323480	sorry, I just ate a truck full of wheat. I work on a farm and I just take it in and I'm,
1323480	1328680	I'm the guy with the guy in the harvesting truck. It's so high. Uh, Jeepers Creepers was chasing me
1328680	1333560	from me and I ran through a field and I just, I guess it was just like a sort of a residual
1333560	1341320	wheat accumulation. Next thing you know, I'm a chronic diuretic. Uh, wheat stay away from it.
1341320	1346440	Are you a shave man? Uh, Dino comes up. Well, Dino came to the apartment and he saw two soaked
1346440	1351480	pair of pajamas that we had kind of like hand washed and hung over the woman's pajamas and
1351480	1358120	a man's pajamas. He's like, what happened there? And I was like, Oh yeah. Uh, the weirdest,
1358360	1364280	the opening of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie happened is what happened. Something that
1364280	1369880	requires diagrams happened. Uh, pretty crazy. Also, there was a time I was, uh, different,
1369880	1374040	same apartment, different girlfriend Robin was there. And, uh, she, uh, damn, we were sitting
1374040	1377880	watching TV in a little front room. And if you, if you, if you want to see this apartment, uh,
1377880	1382280	go watch channel one on one, anything like laser fired computer, man, it all takes place
1382280	1387080	with the orange sofa and the white walls. That's, that's the place. And, uh, we're sitting there and,
1387080	1393480	uh, Robin gets up and says, then, Hey, I'm going to go into the kitchen and she makes you snack. You
1393480	1405560	want a little snacky poo poo bear? So I'm sitting there watching this go on and, uh, and, and she
1405560	1409480	runs out to make him some cottage cheese. Uh, not make him, she doesn't make cottage cheese.
1410680	1414840	They didn't live in a cottage, but she, she goes and she comes back with a little plate,
1414840	1419240	little, you know, like, you know, dollop, big dog of cottage cheese and he's beautifully
1419240	1424200	fanned out canned peaches, you know, gorgeously arranged and all array around the top of the
1424200	1428920	thing. And she brings in the room and dang goes, ah, I kind of rolls his eyes and grits his teeth.
1428920	1434600	She goes, what, what the fuck? I fucking hate that face. You make that stupid poo poo face.
1436920	1441400	And I was like, I'm just, I'm just sitting there digging it. I, I, I'm Shane Goodall for this one.
1442360	1447880	And, and dang goes, look, I know you're a good girlfriend for making me the cottage cheese and
1447880	1453720	going the extra mile of putting the peaches on top. I know that makes you a good girlfriend because
1453720	1458040	you're trying to make it extra special and beautiful for me. And it's, I love that about
1458040	1462520	you, but we've had this conversation like four times. I don't like the peaches on the cottage
1462520	1468040	cheese because the juice and the peaches goes in to the cottage cheese. It makes it runny and
1468120	1471720	watery. And it's gross. And like, and I know that you're a good person for doing that,
1472520	1475480	but I just don't understand how many more times we're going to have to have
1476840	1481560	the cottage cheese and peaches conversation. She goes, well, then just say that. Just say that.
1481560	1484200	I hate you. And you make that poo poo face. And Dan goes,
1484200	1487640	that's a stupid thing to hate. Abraham Lincoln hated slavery. What are you going to talk about
1487640	1503560	in heaven? And I sang a little, a little ditty that went don't date Dan Harmon.
1505320	1508840	Fucking awesome. One swoop. You took a right.
1510840	1512440	Everyone wandered off. That's the best.
1512440	1518600	We didn't time this, right? I'll do it. You talk. I'll make you a joke.
1518600	1524120	Oh, okay. Thank you. Thanks. He's a, he's a big fan. He's, he's Watson to my Sherlock.
1531480	1534760	You guys have seen those movies of course, where Sherlock Holmes is so smart,
1534760	1539880	he can beat the shit out of people. It's insane. Do you do realize that? Like, like, like,
1539880	1544600	I don't know if there's like, like super, super duper Dan Harmon, Rob Schwab fans,
1544600	1548920	then you're familiar with a thing we did in 1999 called Heat Vision and Jack, which was Jack Black.
1553640	1557560	Jack Black was an astronaut. He's the smartest guy in the world, blah, blah, blah. We, we tried
1557560	1562600	to write a movie version of it a long time ago and that was, it was like, saw Sherlock Holmes.
1562600	1566600	It was like, this is the bit that I was doing. Like the bit was that he's like, like, like,
1566600	1571400	he can, like, you know, he gets really smart. He's so smart. He knows how to beat the shit out of you,
1571400	1576600	which is not, that's not, because that's not really smart. That's the joke. But their joke
1576600	1584200	is a blockbuster film. They made a sequel and I want to see it. I haven't seen them. Are they good?
1584200	1588120	They're not, they're not good, but, but like, people like them by applause. Who likes those
1588120	1594440	movies? They're good. Three guys. With media, with television and movies, it's like, and a girl.
1594440	1598120	Sorry. You know, you, you throw enough money at these things. It's like these people are so
1598120	1603880	handsome and charming and you love Robert Downey Jr. You love Jude Law. Is that his name? Yeah.
1606200	1609800	I mean, this is not funny, but like that strikes me as a movie that they just wrote a movie and
1609800	1615800	they added the title to it because you have to add a recognizable franchise to something to make it.
1615800	1619720	I don't think that's true because this, this movie would have had to have been called
1620360	1627880	action in the Queen Victoria's alleys. You know, it wouldn't, there wasn't something that,
1627880	1631160	I believe that with other movies where you go like, this isn't Tremors Three.
1634040	1639480	This is just a regular movie about aliens invading Las Vegas. It was called Lucky Seven
1640840	1647640	from Planet Saturn and you added Tremors Aliens. Anyways, speaking of Prometheus,
1647640	1654280	did we talk about, and again, I haven't seen it and won't. I don't want to see that.
1655000	1659400	I am going to write a movie. It's a prequel to the Die Hard mythology
1661240	1665960	and thank you. Thank you. He's joking, but your applause will make it actually happen.
1667080	1675320	It's called Nakatomi and it's not, you know, don't go there expecting to see anyone say
1675320	1687880	Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker. There's no walkie-talkies in it. It's just cheers some DNA with Die Hard, I guess.
1692440	1694120	This is how Dan pitches things to studio.
1696520	1700280	Hey Dan, great. I'm glad you could come. Let's hear about your new project. Yeah,
1700280	1704520	it's an hour and a half of you watching guys discover a puddle of black goo that turns into
1704520	1715720	a skyscraper, a cop, and a terrorist. Right at the end. Oh, my wife's leaving me. Maybe starting to.
1717000	1723720	I think I'll enjoy people shooting glass later. That was my Alan Rickman.
1725960	1733160	That was bad. That sounded a lot like a toothless retarded Sean Connery. Something happened.
1733720	1738760	Now, can we hear you Sean Connery? Most things down here don't react well to blurts.
1739880	1746680	That's not bad. That's not bad. It's all right. Thank you. How many Sean Connerys have you heard?
1748840	1753960	Come on, give me someone else. I heard Christopher Watkins. Oh, I got a Pringle for a fever.
1756040	1760760	Come on, come on, come on, come on. Down nuts. Down nuts. Wow, Jack.
1763160	1771000	Down nuts merging into Bill Clinton. All right. Well, Jack, you gotta pay the rent.
1771000	1780040	Otherwise, it's not clear what the inflation is. Little George. Popeye right at the end.
1780760	1783960	Now, finish off with Rosie Perez because I know you do a good Rosie Perez.
1783960	1787160	All right. So go from who to Rosie Perez. Popeye into Rosie.
1787720	1791240	Hey, don't do that to me, okay.
1796920	1801880	Give me some spinach, girl. I'll stab you in the eye, motherfucker, because I'm Spanish.
1803480	1808200	Why are you a writer? Why waste this? You could have a show.
1817160	1824680	That's the best. I don't want this to be a, I don't want Harmontown to be a sad place.
1825880	1830200	I think it should be a free place where we're free. She's probably a Harmontown fan. Also,
1830200	1832760	she was the only girl that clapped for the Sherlock Holmes movies.
1833880	1846360	I am a major addict of the Tumblr blog about me called Having Changed. There's a blog about me.
1847400	1851240	And it's about you, too, and our relationship. Really?
1851240	1857720	Everything we do together, every ice cream we get, every kite we fly, every Insta-wee-gram
1859320	1863080	is chronicled on this Tumblr blog. Every move you make, every breath you take.
1863960	1868120	And I really, really hope to God that the person that maintains that blog isn't here
1868120	1872760	and doesn't get back to them, because then they won't stop right away, but it'll be the death of
1872760	1877640	it. But I can't think of a cooler thing. I think every single person in the world should have a
1877640	1883320	Tumblr blog about everything. If you just take a picture of yourself brushing your teeth,
1883320	1887800	and then 30 seconds later, it's like, it's a Tumblr entry. He's brushing his teeth!
1889320	1893480	And it's just like, so-and-so like this. It's like a heart with 35 after it.
1893480	1898440	Like, I don't know what I'm going to do when this stops. I may...
1898600	1902920	Well, because you're overly obsessive about reading the comment sections in reviews of
1902920	1908440	your show or things you do, which I think is just insanity. To go read the comment
1908440	1914120	section of anything, it's always a bunch of just dicks. The people that write comments
1914120	1919160	are generally not good fans, good reviewers, or people that have some weird axe to grind,
1919160	1922520	and then it devolves into some sort of weird racist conversation.
1922520	1925160	But then there's all these wonderful people. My girlfriend, Erin McGathey,
1925240	1930360	who's hit podcast, top 20 comedy podcast codpiece.
1932360	1933800	Speaking of Chevy Chase, I have a voicemail.
1937240	1940120	I just did Chevy, oh, the pod, pod, pod piece?
1943720	1944760	You're going to become him, you know.
1945960	1946440	Do-doy.
1949080	1954600	Yeah. I want to write a book about, just called Conversations in a Trailer with Chevy Chase.
1955160	1956760	Where I tried to convince myself I wasn't...
1958920	1966680	Yeah, anyways. My girlfriend got a Facebook message, I think, from a couple girls who tracked
1966680	1971480	her down. She used to be a camp counselor for kids and stuff, and they just heard her podcast,
1971480	1974680	and they just wanted to write her a letter and say, we're juniors in college now,
1974680	1977560	and you're very inspiring and charming, and it's great that you're doing this thing,
1977560	1984040	and all this stuff, and very touching letters. That's what it's all about, much like the hanky
1984040	1988200	panky. No, totally unlike the hanky panky. The hanky panky is just about putting left and right
1988200	1992200	things and stuff. What entertainment is all about is...
2003000	2003880	I didn't have a cute-up.
2006440	2009880	Boy. That's another topic we could talk about. My brain is disintegrating.
2010600	2011720	No, no. You're losing it.
2011720	2015480	Yeah. I'm not on it anymore. But I think that if I play it on video games,
2015480	2019720	everything's going to come back, and I've been taking some very promising meetings, Jeff.
2019720	2020920	It's very exciting.
2020920	2022840	I heard your pitch voice. It sounds good.
2029320	2035160	We're in a Godzilla movie, but it's not going to be a guy in a suit,
2035160	2041960	jumping around a bunch of cardboard skyscrapers. We have the state-of-the-art technology.
2043160	2051400	His motion capture is going to be a real reptilian monster in keeping with the scientific laws of the
2051400	2061800	current census. Who wants to see your Godzilla movie? Are you retarded? You fixed Godzilla.
2062600	2067880	You're a genius. Oh, man. God damn it.
2068920	2070520	What were you talking about before hanky panky?
2071560	2075320	I can't believe I forgot the hokey pokey podcast.
2075880	2079880	Yeah. But yeah, some chicks she knew contacted her and made her feel good. Whatever.
2083720	2084840	That's what it's all about.
2086360	2089400	So the story didn't lose team. It just didn't matter to you.
2092280	2093320	You just lost interest.
2093320	2099640	I wanted to ramp into a forced emotional expression of how much I value the fans
2100920	2104920	to make them go, aww, because I'm not very funny tonight.
2104920	2107080	So I thought I would tug at their hashtags.
2107080	2114520	Dan discovered that there are Tumblr blogs that are just dedicated to the daily quotidian shit
2114520	2119160	that Dan does. Oh, Dan's having a sandwich. Dan's going to have one.
2119160	2122120	And they make a gif and he's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and then people like that.
2122120	2126520	And his little heart's going above it. They like that Dan ate that sandwich.
2126520	2129640	And Dan, we're all having a conversation. It was me, you, Aaron, and the thing.
2129640	2136520	Were you there, Dino? And we're sitting there and Dan just completely went like to Neverland.
2136520	2139640	Like, all right, I think they're to Oz. And it was just looking at the second.
2139640	2143240	His big smile came across his face. He goes, sorry, guys. Like, this is going to be the next
2143240	2148680	72 hours of my life. You go through those things. You're going back through time
2148760	2151960	of every picture that you've ever posted or anyone's ever posted of you.
2151960	2155480	And it's this big love fest. And there's none of the negativity that goes along with being,
2155480	2160120	you know, the bottom of a YouTube. Yeah, they're never like day eight. I found out his butt sticks.
2161560	2166600	Oh, he's his hair everywhere. His hair all over. Well, you don't post those photos though.
2166600	2168440	Now start doing that shit and find out. All right.
2170040	2174680	Well, we got to we got a cameraman here. Maybe we'll we'll take some afterpicks for my new diet.
2175640	2181000	We yeah, we should have done meeting with the goddess. We should have been taking pictures of
2181000	2186280	you if we'd known all along and have like this, you know, like this like timeline of, you know,
2186920	2190200	how we both look. Yeah. As the circles under my eyes get bigger.
2190200	2192360	Who could have predicted my dramatic weight loss?
2194280	2197560	I mean, it's amazing.
2197560	2203800	You were you were notably bigger than you are right now.
2203800	2211400	Yeah. That's like a Martian came down like, what are these people? Who are they going to see?
2211400	2215320	What's so important about Harman town? And it's just like, this is quiet. And it was like,
2215320	2219800	no, was I was I fatter in January? You were wearing darker pants. Well, yeah,
2219800	2224120	but I went just straight to my thighs and everyone's just like, texting.
2224360	2229320	These humans seem to be directionless and weightless. They seem to have met with their
2229320	2234920	goddess. Now, send them the cancer. What's the next step? And assuming that you guys know what
2234920	2240200	he's talking about, it's the Joseph Campbell's hero's journey. So what is this the step after
2240200	2243800	meeting with the goddess? We can't. How can we know, Jeff? We have to figure it out ourselves.
2243800	2248680	That's the whole mythologically. It's what the tone about the father? Yes, I would say the
2249160	2254280	yeah. Now we have to grapple with we have to decide tonight what we're going to do from now on.
2255000	2259240	And then we have to pay the heavy price for that. I'm assuming in attendance numbers.
2263320	2269960	But I would say that, you know, knowing Dan for a long time, Dan's a very intellectual guy,
2269960	2276680	very emotional internally. And it's very, very rewarding to be a friend of Dan's. And also,
2277560	2281800	I think that if you're fans of the things he's made, take five, Dan, I'm talking about you.
2283400	2286680	If you're fans of things that Dan's made, you sense that Dan is in them. When you watch the
2286680	2290360	characters on community, they're all Dan, like they're all versions of himself and that thing.
2290360	2295560	And like Dan gives a lot to people. And I think that coming here and sitting here,
2295560	2299560	like ideally, people would sit here and watch you get up there wearing your stupid sash and
2299560	2306440	drinking your vodka and talking about your butt that it's somehow it manages to be redemptive
2306520	2310440	because there's something very charming and human about somebody getting up there
2310440	2313080	and revealing all those things about themselves. Right.
2320200	2321800	I think that all that goes without saying.
2324040	2329080	Well, we'll cut it out for the podcast. All right, Adam. Yes.
2329080	2332920	There's another email from my brother that came a week earlier than that one.
2333240	2336200	Just give this one a quick read. Do we need music for this?
2336200	2338120	The subject line is again, you sucking.
2340760	2344120	Yeah, whatever music was. Well, I've got daybreak pulled up, so we'll just go to daybreak.
2347400	2350920	You sucking four thirty eight a.m. Is this the same day or is this on?
2352120	2358040	OK, so it's separate stuff, separate stuff. OK, because the last email was sent at four
2358040	2361720	twenty and this one sent on four twenty. So I think he has like a theme going.
2361800	2363400	Do you want something different, more emotional?
2364760	2366840	OK, let me I got you. Give me one second.
2366840	2367800	What did you play last time?
2367800	2369880	All right, that was lovely. Let's let's let's let's try something else.
2371080	2372840	I don't have any fucking and you.
2375960	2377640	Oh, this might be good. I like this.
2380040	2381000	Hey, fucker.
2386120	2389800	I think you'd be a millionaire if you wrote for a video game franchise with a likeable
2389800	2394920	but gruff protagonist. B.U.T.T. Gruff. Sorry, investigate.
2396040	2398280	And when you're a millionaire, because you follow my advice,
2398280	2400920	email me back, you fuzzy back shit knocker.
2402120	2405080	Hey, I see you're dabbling with digital video again.
2405080	2407800	Are you going to make some more home videos about farts?
2408600	2411080	OK, OK, let's have a serious brother moment.
2412200	2417000	Yeah, so I was just rubbing my balls and I was thinking these balls are so big,
2417480	2422440	uh, smooth. And then I just start to think about your balls while I was rubbing my balls.
2422440	2427080	I imagine your balls are tiny and wrinkly like a lemon that didn't get enough sun.
2429960	2432920	Good times. Good times.
2433720	2437720	I'll email you again in a few months, you know, just to prove I'm funnier than you.
2438600	2441960	You know, because of what with the ball jokes and stuff.
2442840	2445240	It's just like you're here on the toilet with me.
2447160	2451560	OK, this was fun. Did you ever notice you have a small head?
2451560	2454600	I mean, look at Al Roker's head sent from my eyebone.
2460680	2465240	Other hand for Adam, the bones, bones reader.
2468680	2474440	Adam has an app coming out on the iPhone where you can subscribe to all bones emails
2475320	2481160	read in his voice. Yeah, he really gets the better of me in those missives, doesn't he?
2481160	2485480	He really, he really, he really gives me the old Judd Apatow talking to Mark Brazil,
2487400	2495960	the old touche, the old I always feel like I'm at the card table next to the Algonquin round one.
2497400	2501000	Like I'm not allowed to hang out with Groucho.
2501960	2505240	Yeah, I like that he has it's a it's a dialogue to himself.
2506680	2509400	He's just kind of like I'm not going to wait for the response. Hey,
2509400	2513560	hey, dipshit. You still a faggot? I know you are.
2515320	2520840	Just kidding. Let's get serious. My balls are serious. They look like your head.
2520840	2523960	Your head's a fucking dick. Hey, look, we're having a lot of fun here.
2525720	2528040	Let's cool it down. I didn't come here to tell ball jokes.
2531400	2535800	He's retarded. He has what kids? He's a father.
2536600	2539320	He's five years older. He's got a niece that I've never met.
2540040	2543960	Now you have a niece. I have a niece.
2545480	2546760	She does the hokey pokey.
2547960	2551560	He did some hanky panky. I gotta yeah.
2551560	2561400	Yeah, I yeah, I. I think there's some circuits, maybe loose wobbly,
2561400	2566200	maybe kind of burnt out in my head. I'm always trying to figure out if it's genetic or
2566200	2572360	if it's nature or nurture. But I know that I my parents and my distant family,
2572360	2576760	they all seem kind of reptilian to me. And I but I think it must be me.
2576760	2582440	I think they seem like very volatile, emotional people. And they they'll write me things. And
2582440	2587400	they're they're very excited and emotional. And I remember being in my house growing up,
2587400	2593400	my mom and my brother were very emotional with each other. Some would say Freudian Lee,
2594040	2598600	emotional with each other. I felt like there was a connection. Your mom and your brother
2598600	2602600	had some sort of weird silent seduction thing going on. I think they always felt like they
2602600	2607400	were kind of like fucking I don't think they were fucking. But I felt like they were always
2607400	2612760	thinking like what if we could always felt like they were still like they felt like they were in
2612760	2618760	against all odds. They were the Sam and Diane. Yeah, that they were like that they were one.
2618760	2625960	There were one family scuba trip and a shark attack from fulfilling their dreams that maybe
2625960	2633000	in some post apocalyptic scenario there it would be necessary for them to have to procreate the
2633000	2639320	species. And they were they seemed game for it. They were always hitting and caressing and for
2639320	2647800	instance, like, I don't know, like, what? Oh, God, thank you, Aaron. Yeah, I was telling my
2647800	2654600	why I did this thing in the bedroom. Aaron was laying in bed and I put a sock over my dick and
2654680	2661080	balls. Who hasn't done that? The chili peppers have done that. You haven't done it. You have a
2661080	2669080	vagina, ma'am. It's like you're holding a sock in the morning and you're naked. I'm pretty sure
2669080	2674120	every guy in here. You don't have to admit it, but you see if it'll fit over your whole thing
2674120	2679400	and it's hanging down. I because I've seen them haven't done it. You haven't done it. All right.
2679400	2683320	Well, we lead vastly different lives. That was a I thought that would be the ones about a time
2683320	2688600	like, oh, yeah, we've all done that. My brother used to do it in front of my mom like he would
2688600	2693560	like run into the we'd be watching like happy days and my brother would run like and he was like,
2693560	2702920	I feel like he was like 13 or like 15 or something or 28. I just remember him as a big kid. Yeah,
2702920	2707800	there's a 15 year old playing in the US Open right now and he would run through the living room like
2707800	2717240	this and my mom would go stop it. I don't know, man. I don't know. I don't know, man.
2718840	2727720	I my parents had I was born. My mom was 41. They're both 41 and so they're a little bit older. They
2727720	2731960	each been married once before they had my brother and I. So they each had two kids. So they kind of
2731960	2735800	made all their parenting mistakes. So I think I got we got the good version of parenting because
2735800	2739960	they'd already like fucked up once before. And so when they had us, they were adults and the hair
2739960	2743080	was getting a little gray and they were just groovy and mellow. But it was also the early set
2743080	2747960	of late 70s and early 80s. And they had these really swanky parties like fondue parties and
2747960	2752360	shit like and all the guys looked like the Marlboro man, the old mustaches and shit. And they were
2752360	2759720	they're good, cool. And like everyone could ride a horse and like the women all smoked like they
2759720	2764120	were like the like my mom's friend Lorraine. She'd be like in a full cocktail dress like from, you
2764120	2769000	know, someone from Auntie Mame. And she'd be like in the kitchen like smoking like a Virginia
2769000	2776440	Slim and stirring the hollandaise for the fondue. Like an ash going in. It was like it was awesome.
2776440	2781560	And so they were kind of I looked up. I thought that these are this a real cocktail party going
2781560	2786760	on. We were little kids and my brother used to we would be sequestered that we'd make an appearance
2786760	2790680	and these are the kids. They're going to bed. Now we can go be adults and get drunk and talk about
2790680	2795240	adult things. And we would go to bed and my brother would take off my pajamas. He would strip
2795240	2799560	me down. He was three years older than me. Bill Davis would strip me down and take my pajamas and
2799560	2804520	run down the hallway into the big opening with this big like kind of giant living room. It's
2804520	2810360	almost like a dance floor and the adults were gathered. And he would throw my pajamas into the
2810360	2818040	middle of the foray. And I would run naked out there and I would get a big laugh because
2818520	2822600	kids run and I like my older brother fucking with a kid. And I was you know three or four with it.
2822600	2825960	And I had run back. I had run back in. I mean we kept doing it. And then the laughter would
2825960	2834040	peter off after a while. But I had my older sisters my mom's first marriage. I have nieces
2834040	2837480	that are one of them is two years younger than I. So we would bathe together when we were really
2837480	2842280	little. So I got this you know this male female anatomy lesson when I was a little kid bathing
2842280	2847160	with Stephanie. And I would see the differences between the male and female anatomy. And at one
2847160	2852840	of the parties I just emerged like all the all the adults are drunk and smoking. And I walked
2852840	2857400	out in the middle of the party and was like just put my hand up and just stopped like oh shit.
2858360	2863160	And I just I was gonna lay some something I learned on them. I was gonna lay it down for
2863160	2871720	her. And I was like everybody. Boys have wee wheeze. Girls have crack wheeze.
2871720	2879480	And then I to abject silence. And I walked back down the long hallway. And I got to my room. And
2879480	2888840	then I remember just applause. And I was certain that I had done a service. Yeah. I always hope
2888840	2892120	my parents were there. Because you wonder why people are fighting. Why is mom and dad always
2892120	2895400	fighting? And why is my sister fighting with this guy? Why is the living room always dirty? Yeah.
2896120	2902200	Crack wheeze. Oh I thought I thought you meant like because I was like my parents like their
2902200	2906920	furniture was magazine stacks. Like they would just do you just the stacks of shit that they
2906920	2911640	wouldn't throw away. They just put shit down on top of it like that hoarders show. Like you see
2911640	2917000	that. And then somebody would come over. The word company would happen. Like we're having company
2917000	2922920	tonight. And that it could happen randomly. But that meant clean the bathtub. Clean the toilet.
2922920	2927080	Get this shit off of the living room floor. What is this? Like my parents would look at their own
2927080	2931880	shit and go what is this? What's going on? We have company tonight. Like they'd all of a sudden for
2931880	2937560	for 24 hours they'd become healthy normal people and like white glove themselves. This is garbage.
2939000	2942360	There's no skippy peanut butter. It just says peanut butter on a white label. They're gonna
2942360	2946760	think we're abusive to our children. We'll turn that around and make a fake Peter Pan logo.
2946760	2952680	Everything was just like put Willie Nelson on. Buy a new record player. I don't care what
2952680	2957480	the fuck we have to do. This is like this is the big deal. And then everyone would come over. They
2957480	2964760	all had mustaches and because it was the 70s they all look like. What's it? Barney Miller.
2966200	2973160	I started with a cast of Barney Miller. W.K.R.P. in Cincinnati. Like everyone's like having a 70s
2973160	2978120	party with like cocktail vases. And that's where I would shine. I would like come out in my
2978120	2983960	footies and like I'd go hey. And everyone would go what's going on? And I'd go how do you tell me?
2986360	2992680	Gotta dance. It didn't take anything. And they'd be like whoa what's this guy's name? I'm going you
2992680	3000520	tell me. I'm not telling. And you just like fucking dance around. But the remarkable thing is that my
3000520	3007960	parents would like who they were they were powerless. Like I had the Nielsen's. So they
3007960	3014520	were like I can't. There's nothing I can do. So they were like Daniel go to bed. And then but then
3014520	3021080	Uncle Uncle Morty and Francis from marketing or whatever would go like no get him out. Hey come
3021080	3025240	on. What's your opinion about spaghetti? Spaghetti you tell me.
3025240	3032600	And everyone was like oh this kid's the best. And my dad would be like he's the best.
3033880	3039400	And then eventually I'd get tired and go to bed. But I'd fucking killed man. I couldn't wait to
3039400	3043880	turn 18 because it was as I was I understood it like that's when you get to leave and the whole
3043880	3048360	world was waiting out there. That's where all those people came from. I was just trapped in
3048360	3053400	this dirty house with stacks of magazines used as card tables. And like then everyone's around.
3053400	3058520	They'd go everyone fake it. And they don't. Everyone fill the airlock with eight people
3058520	3063240	from the real world. And they loved me. So I was like we're going to get out there.
3064600	3070600	Make them happy. My my sister Pam who is she's like about 20 years older than I because he was
3070600	3076680	my mom's first marriage and she got married to Marty. This really nice lovable guy. He looked
3076680	3081720	like Mario from the you know from the Super Mario games. He was really pleasant and easy going.
3081720	3087720	Turned out later on that he was a chronic liar and you know they got divorced. He turned out to
3087720	3093080	not be so hot. But at the beginning stages we all loved Marty. But the first time I met him I think
3093080	3098520	I was four and I had to put a suit on. And I hated putting a suit on back then. I remember
3098520	3103160	like memories of me like I'm four god damn and put the tie on like this is so stupid.
3104200	3109800	And but also it was the 70s. So it was like I had a red white and blue plaid suit.
3110040	3116600	It was fucked up. It was bad. And so I got all dressed up and I'm a little penny loafers on
3117240	3121480	and I was playing like Battlestar Galactica. Cylons in my room and I like Jeffrey.
3122680	3126040	Your sister's boyfriend is out front. They were engaged to get married and I was so
3126920	3131880	angry at this this this phantom guy coming into our house. I didn't know he was I just hated him
3131880	3137320	already. And again you know like crack wheeze and you know wheeze and things like that.
3137320	3141240	Men and women were different and I just he was it was an enemy. So he comes in
3141800	3147080	and they go Jeffrey get out of there. Marty's here and this nice guy big guy big kind of
3147080	3150840	hulking guy and he squats down like in his haunches like that gets down low and puts his
3150840	3155080	arms out. And I run down the hallway that you know I used to run down naked to get my pajamas
3155080	3159880	and stuff. And I run down right at him and he's got his arms out. And I had nothing in my mind.
3159880	3163320	I had no plan of attack. I just kicked him square in the balls.
3163320	3169720	And you've probably seen some movie or something where that was funny. I don't know man. I just
3169720	3177640	felt like he was like if when uh you expected it to make a boing noise. No like when Hans Solo is
3177640	3181240	sitting having dinner with Lando Calrissian and Darth Vader walks in he just starts shooting.
3181240	3187720	He doesn't say anything. He goes he blocks it but like you when you see an enemy you just attack.
3187800	3194680	And I just I ran I went bang and hit him. And if you don't have balls a four-year-old's penny
3194680	3201560	lovers can do the job. Absolutely. And all I remember was I hit him everyone. Oh they're
3201560	3206120	about there are about 15 people in attendance and no one saw that coming.
3208280	3214920	Least of whom Marty and the whole this went whoa. And Marty tipped over like a fucking just just
3215160	3219800	like you're like just like a chain guy. I went right over and I hung a hard right and ran out
3219800	3226280	the front door and climbed a tree. And there's an awesome tree out front like fuck this guy. I'm
3226280	3231000	gonna climb a tree. Be a kid. Fuck you. It's like when a cat runs into a wall it just starts licking
3231000	3237400	itself. Like yeah you caught me in the middle of my run into a wall then lick myself. So I
3237400	3242360	by bone out I get out I'm out front I'm climbing a tree and I hear like a combination of laughter
3242360	3250360	horror moaning Marty's and Marty's having a medical emergency. Everybody's laughing. Some
3250360	3254440	people are like just like like like it was like it was chaos inside the house. I could hear it.
3254440	3258120	So I'm climbing a tree and I'm up in a tree. I remember this so vividly. I've got to be four
3258120	3263080	years old. Beautiful day. Something California. The wind is blowing. So I say this is the stuff
3263080	3269240	you know. I just took down that motherfucker and I climb on my tree. I think the instinct was to
3269240	3273800	like go be king of the castle. Like get high. Like like like go at like you know you separate
3273800	3279640	yourself. Go back to heaven. You know where gods live. Where titans dwell. And then I fell out the
3279640	3284520	tree. Because I was wearing penny loafers and you don't you don't gain a lot of purchase with the
3284520	3289880	fucking footing on a tree with the penny loafer. And I fell straight backwards. And if I had not
3289880	3294760	got my foot caught in like like in a crunch of a limb. My foot got fucking caught me. I would have
3294760	3300920	broken my neck and probably died. All the kids are pretty supple. But I fell to my death and got
3300920	3306120	caught. And now I'm hanging upside down by one foot. And at four years old I don't have the core
3306120	3314440	strength. You'll get that later at 25. You'll be like when I learn to stop kicking people in the
3314440	3321800	balls. So I'm trying to. Now I'm out of steam. Because dinner is about to happen. I decide to
3321800	3328520	kick a dude in the balls. Climb a tree. And now I'm alone. And what I can't do is appeal for help.
3329960	3333320	So I was out there with the blood rushing in my head for what I think was an hour.
3334600	3337800	And finally people got worried about me and it came out. And then there was more laughter.
3339080	3348280	And guess who came and got me. Uncle uncle. Mario. Yeah. That was the worst.
3348280	3356840	We had a we had a tweet that came in 21 minutes ago to at Harmon town. It said finish your Indiana
3356840	3362520	Jones tangent. Oh yeah. Your picture. You're going to make an Indiana Jones movie. Wait was that what
3362520	3366760	it is. Oh the right. Oh the right. Well we went on the right. We went to Disneyland. We went on the
3366760	3380280	right. It was fun. Happy. Slater. Slater. Is that a reference to my show. I don't like the ride
3380280	3384760	that much. I've been on it. I remember when it came out. I was very excited about it. But like
3384760	3389720	it's not the best. Disneyland has a weird hypnotic thing going where you're so satisfied with so
3389720	3396440	little. They also though they do so many things so right. I can't figure it out. We went to Magic
3396440	3402360	Mountain together. And that's all just about thrills chills and spills. And I haven't been
3402360	3407640	paid to tell you that. But that's just walking around a park like you're going from one roller
3407640	3413320	coaster to another. The most terrifying one of all the X2 or whatever because they won't fucking
3413320	3419800	tell you what it is. Everything is like oh what is the Cocoa Puffs ride. You're crazy for Cocoa Puffs.
3419800	3426680	You have to help me find more Cocoa on this ride. It's the best ride. This is stupid. But
3426680	3430520	they're going to find Cocoa. But the X2 thing they just the whole ride they keep going.
3430520	3434840	Are you ready for this? Do you know what you're doing? Are you sure? Have you said goodbye to
3434840	3438760	your loved ones? They changed it because when it was just X. Have you guys been to Magic Mountain
3438760	3443800	and been on X or X2? Fucking good. If you like scary rides. But the original I'm certain of this.
3443800	3448040	I went on it like three times. The original X you know when you're like like keep your hands and
3448040	3453080	arms and sad to train at all times. Like that little spiel you get. The X one was like everybody
3453080	3458440	you're about to be on X. X is a thrilling experience. Make sure that you like you leave
3458440	3462920	your keys with somebody you trust because you're about to go on X. It's really crazy.
3463720	3466600	Drink some orange juice. Your jaw may wiggle a little bit.
3467560	3470440	But they were really prepared. Expected unsolicited back rubs and
3470760	3480840	expressions of intent to call one another more often. Millennials will call it E.
3483720	3487960	I was told by some guy that came in for some pitch meeting. He's telling me about the four
3487960	3493480	stages that generations go through. It's like baby boomers are the blah blah blah generation.
3493480	3498280	And the generation X is this. They always react to the previous generation. And then the
3499000	3502920	it sounded like it was such bullshit. I can't articulate. I wanted to like throw a rock at
3502920	3507080	the guy's head because I was like what are you saying. You're just saying what your brain wants
3507080	3512360	to be the case. There's nothing there's nothing entertaining about this tangent. I just it was
3512360	3516600	so interesting to me because of course we all think in rhythms of four but we're all projecting
3516600	3523240	like oh yeah remember that World War II generation. Like they sat around saying that no let's be a big
3523240	3529880	generation and go fight World War II. You know we spent the entire day as people do at Disneyland
3529880	3535160	talking about all the many people who have died at Disneyland which alarms because I have to
3535160	3539000	figure that that means like a 40 people die at Magic Mountain every week and no one talks about
3539000	3543960	it. There's like 15 things if you go Google it you know Google Disneyland deaths. It's very
3543960	3550120	interesting. The most horrific one is is the Mark Twain boats coming in. I was I wasn't working
3550120	3554760	that day but I was an employee of Disneyland when that happened. I could have been and I did a show
3554760	3558680	right in front of that. It could have happened right there. I was here with Gorley and he said
3558680	3563720	you were there too and and he was saying yeah I worked here when that Smoke Mountain
3564600	3568200	Decapitation happened or something like like what was it Thunder Mountain the railroad.
3568200	3573720	Like some kid got disconnected and then you break his neck. There's two groups of people the people
3573720	3577880	that know what I'm talking about the people are like get to your fucking point. I'm sorry about
3577880	3585320	that. I want to describe the one Disneyland death that is amazing to me. Yeah. It's the Mark Twain
3585320	3591880	boat coming in. It's so gross. And when it comes around if it's beyond a certain speed you're
3591880	3596680	supposed to let it go all the way around. Like and the people on board it happens sometimes they go
3596680	3602200	what the fuck. Ladies and gentlemen coming in too fast wouldn't want a horrible thing to happen. So
3603320	3606840	we're going all the way around and I'm sure everyone's like fuck you you fucking dick.
3607720	3614760	I got a fast pass to fucking green green lanterns asshole. I got I got I got to be there at 1030
3614760	3619400	or I'm going to fucking lose the time of my life. You're fucking around with me you fucking bureaucrats.
3619400	3626360	What they don't know is that what happens when you don't do that is this. The the riverboat came
3626360	3631640	in a little too fast. The manager on duty didn't know enough to let go. I think he was not the
3631640	3636360	regular guy. I'm not sure how much is a apocryphal as you say a word I learned from you. How much
3636440	3645400	isn't. But I read this on many websites and they had animated gifs on the side that were like no
3645400	3651000	but skulls that had mouse ears on them. So I think this is the real story.
3653160	3658120	The riverboat came in. They didn't they tied it off even though it was coming in too fast.
3658120	3664040	The rope went tout and and the first thing that happened is it. How are you supposed to say tout
3664040	3671800	taught. You say tout tout. No tout is a guy that gives you tips at a racetrack bagel bagel.
3674760	3680920	Fuck you guys. I honestly if you're gonna teach people English like like Google I mean I only
3680920	3688760	ever read these words. I never heard anyone say that. My mom never said tout tout. I read it. I
3688840	3697720	know what it means. Dan still says bagel. It's a bagel. It's a bag. It's a bag. The first three
3697720	3706200	letters are bag. You put shit in a bag. You guys are dicks you know. I just don't get it and one
3706200	3727880	day you will. The rope stretches tout. Across the shins of the guy who called for the tying off
3727880	3733480	of the thing snaps both of his shins in half because it goes so tight. That's chapter one.
3734280	3738520	I wouldn't even mention this story if that's all that happened. The rope then pulls on the metal
3738520	3745560	cleat in the dock so hard that the metal cleat up roots from the wood and slingshots at the
3745560	3752600	speed of sound across Disneyland and explodes a dude's head. Yeah and from what I remember and
3752600	3757320	again who knows how much is apocryphal or not but that one guy's foot got mostly severed I believe
3757320	3762200	and I went through a guy's head who got mostly decapitated and the dude's shoe. The guy's shoe
3762280	3768760	I don't know how familiar you are with Frontierland but apparently the dude's foot
3769800	3775720	the guy's shoe landed in the Mexican restaurant which is it which is it it's not it's not right
3775720	3781160	there it's like it's a long way for a shoe to go if your foot's still in it. Yeah the Frontierland
3782280	3786200	you'd be racist to assume Frontierland is right where the Mexican restaurants are.
3786200	3792760	It wasn't civilized like it was a it was a it was a Tomorrowland adjacent Mexican restaurant
3793400	3802760	that served only progressive Mexican food. They had hologram refried beans and laser laser churros.
3804760	3809480	Anyways you've left out the important part that wasn't the shoe had the foot still in it. I believe
3809480	3813720	so the guy's the thing went to the guy's went through a guy's face and knocked his head off
3813720	3817480	and there's blood everywhere apparently and then went through a guy's foot and the foot landed in
3817480	3824600	someone's enchilada and uh and then uh it's in the news for an hour because Disneyland owns the
3824600	3829880	entire goddamn world and that they go hey everybody you can run this for 24 hours and then if you if
3829880	3835720	you run it again we'll shut you down. Like what? By the time the newspapers ran it the story was
3835720	3842520	that Disneyland had a new severed foot world. They had they had created a whole mythology.
3842600	3849640	There were costume characters. There was a mare of severed foot world. There was a new ride uh
3849640	3856200	Mark Ruffalo was there. Everyone was pretending to have one foot and and they were singing a
3856200	3861560	song that was written by Randy Newman. It was uh uh they they were there it's it's it's a dystopia.
3863480	3866840	It's a dystopic. You got a foot in your food.
3866840	3878440	I don't need no foot because I'm not in no mood. I said you got a foot in your food.
