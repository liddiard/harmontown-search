0	5240	Ladies and gentlemen, Hormontown is now in session.
5240	18640	And now, please welcome the mayor of Hormontown, Dan Harmon.
18640	33000	Everything work out okay?
33000	34000	Did that work?
34000	35000	Okay.
35000	36000	All right.
36000	37000	We had a little false start there.
37000	38000	Okay.
38000	39000	Sure you don't want to...
39000	40000	Because we can pick it up.
40000	41000	All right.
41000	42000	Okay.
42000	43000	You don't want to get a better...
43000	44000	All right.
44000	46000	Because it seemed a little dry.
46000	47000	Sad.
47000	48000	All right.
48360	49360	All right.
49360	51360	Comptroller Duncan Trussell, things are going on.
51360	52360	Hello.
52360	53360	How are you?
53360	54360	How are you?
54360	55360	How are you?
55360	56360	I'm great, man.
56360	57360	Thanks for asking.
57360	58360	How you been?
58360	59360	How's the tour going?
59360	60360	It's going great.
60360	61360	I got...
61360	62360	I mean, I really...
62360	68360	I've said I got nothing in the past, but really, I'm just rung like a rag.
68360	74240	I did San Francisco, I did Austin, I did Houston in the last three days, and I went
74240	75240	to Communicon.
75240	76240	A lot of these people are here from Communicon.
76240	81600	Communicon, Duncan.
81600	82600	Home of the Communicorn.
82600	83600	Wow.
83600	84600	Oh, wow.
84600	86360	You know, I had a...
86360	93160	In Vancouver, my cab driver asked me if I believed in unicorns and then started presenting
93160	97760	a very convincing argument for the existence of unicorns in Africa.
97760	98760	Really?
98760	99760	Yeah.
99760	100760	It was a long conversation.
100760	101760	What...
102760	105760	I didn't even know there was like a...
105760	107960	I didn't even know that it was possible.
107960	111360	It was so beautiful, his belief in unicorns.
111360	113040	It was incredible, and he kind of...
113040	116640	And then I realized he kind of looks like a unicorn, and I started thinking, oh, he's
116640	120000	a unicorn driving a cab.
120000	124840	He was saying unicorns exist, and does he think there's a cover-up?
124840	125840	Yes.
125840	132720	Because the missing ingredient of this is there would have to be a cover-up.
132720	139880	My friend, all roads lead to reptilians when you believe in unicorns, because it ventured
139880	143440	into the reptilian realm after he was explaining...
143440	147840	Like once I told him, I definitely believe in unicorns, but I don't.
147840	151920	But you know, like coast to coast, you know the show Coast to Coast when he's listening
151920	158080	to people who believe in interesting ideas, he will just let them talk about it, because
158080	159080	that's like...
159080	160080	Which one is coast to...
160080	161080	Is that Art Bell?
161080	162080	It's Art Bell.
162080	163080	Now it's George Norrie now, isn't it?
163080	166360	Art Bell's coming back again, but he was the master of letting...
166360	168080	Bringing out a person's story.
168080	174760	So yeah, what he said is that he went up into the woods for a long time, and he got the
174760	177240	ability to pet squirrels.
177240	184040	Like squirrels wouldn't run from him anymore, because he had become so pure.
184040	188240	So that happened to him, and then he saw a unicorn, but he wasn't in Africa.
188240	190120	He never saw a unicorn.
190120	194560	But it's the theory is unicorns will only come to someone who's very pure.
194560	197880	So his point is like, you know, you start with squirrels.
197880	200160	It's like a starter unicorn.
200160	210200	The squirrel, it's like a burner cell phone for the aspiring drug dealer that is a unicorn
210200	213240	handler.
213240	221560	You're not Gus Fring just yet, you just got your little card, your little pay card.
221560	223800	I feel like that is something that...
223800	229480	That's a conversation that I would never have with a cab driver, and when I'm with Dino
229480	236080	Stamatopoulos, I feel like I witnessed it happen, within 10 minutes, it'll turn out
236080	242000	if the bartender is into S&M, it will come out.
242000	244240	And Dino never says anything.
244240	249000	He doesn't like walk around going, who's into S&M?
249000	254360	But the bartender will just volunteer because I'm near Dino, like she'll go, so did you
254360	255920	want a rum and coke?
255920	256920	Okay, here you go.
256920	263080	And I'm like, can I tell you something crazy?
263080	264160	It's uncanny.
264160	267000	And I think with you, I think this is a thing with people.
267000	272680	I think we emit like an aura, a pheromone or something, we kind of, that must be right?
272680	273880	Yeah, I think so.
273880	275040	Yeah, that's cool.
275040	281520	I mean, I'd much rather somebody talk about S&M than unicorns, but on the same, actually
281520	283040	kind of, I like them both.
283800	285480	Yeah, I know what you mean.
285480	292040	This is something that is a chaos magic practice where you look at the entire universe as an
292040	296920	oracle and when you go out into the universe with the intention of learning something,
296920	301640	it will start talking to you and whatever you're putting out, it'll reflect back and
301640	303880	give you a chance to learn more about the universe.
303880	309040	So in this case, it was unicorns, man.
310040	321040	The idea behind unicorns is that he knew all these crazy unicorn details, like they carry
321040	324040	a baby for two years in their stomach.
329040	332040	Is it because the horn?
334040	338040	You should get a baby unicorn out of you as soon as possible, I would think.
338040	340040	Depending on how that horn works.
340040	342040	Well, the horn is a receiver.
342040	345040	The horn acts as a kind of antenna, according to him.
345040	348040	Right, because nothing in nature has no purpose.
348040	355040	Like, God knows, deer who have way more than a unicorn horn, they're receiving all kinds
355040	356040	of magic.
357040	359040	No, they're just deer.
359040	364040	This guy doesn't give a shit about deer, even though they have way more horns than unicorns.
365040	366040	I just thought that was kind of odd.
366040	368040	Like unicorns, they're not that remarkable.
368040	373040	They're just a horse with one shitty horn.
373040	378040	It's like they're almost less remarkable looking than a deer.
378040	380040	That's right, yeah.
380040	382040	I guess they're albino.
382040	385040	There's something about they're sort of white and glory.
385040	386040	Big deal.
386040	387040	There's white horses.
387040	388040	Big deal.
388040	390040	Their blood cures illnesses.
390040	391040	Their blood kills.
391040	395040	You're just quoting the monster manual.
398040	402040	I'm saying that the image of a unicorn, it's just a horse with a horn.
402040	406040	That's the bare minimum requirement of a unicorn.
406040	410040	I think it's kind of funny, because if you add a second horn, you immediately get like
410040	411040	a gazelle.
413040	416040	And like a shitty one, too, because it's not curved yet.
416040	419040	And you're like, oh, look at that shitty gazelle.
419040	420040	Oh, that's not a shitty gazelle.
420040	422040	That's a double unicorn.
423040	424040	Oh, all right.
424040	426040	Well, excuse me for not.
430040	433040	Speaking of unicorns, I'd like to talk about disabled people.
436040	442040	I was at Communicon today, and this always, my heart always kind of fractures a little
442040	448040	bit, because there's invariably, if I do like a WGA panel or something like that, this
448040	453040	doesn't happen enough, but it happens frequently enough that I've marked the memory.
453040	459040	It's like someone in a wheelchair will come up, and they will want to talk about the really
459040	465040	conspicuous lack of differently abled people on television.
466040	472040	I have an inherent, because I'm a big drunk slob, like my job is to like be a curmudgeon,
472040	481040	and I really am not a big fan of the idea of TV characters as ambassadors, but I think
481040	484040	that that's an unavoidable thing, and I do think it's notable.
484040	488040	I think it's a fucked up thing that when somebody in a wheelchair rolls into a room, we all
488040	493040	have a reaction where we kind of start to treat them like a living ghost, because we
493040	497040	don't, for the best reason, because we don't want people to feel pain, and there's always
497040	504040	somebody, there's this wonderful young lady who came up to me as an aspiring writer who,
504040	509040	I don't think she made it here to the show, but she was at Communicon, I think her name
509040	517040	was Lara, and I had a long talk with her about this, and I've had this talk before, which
517040	522040	is that, I guess the reason I'm bringing this up is because this is a podcast.
522040	526040	If you're in a wheelchair and you're out there, unless you're just in one because you think
526040	530040	it's comfortable, I'm not talking to you if that's the case.
530040	534040	You're weird, that's weird.
534040	542040	If you're differently abled, and you are watching television, and you're watching all these
542040	547040	jagoffs walk around, not in wheelchairs, and you're waiting for that character to come
547040	554040	on screen in a wheelchair, and then they do, and it's like the kid from Glee, and it leaves
554040	557040	you a little empty inside like a Snickers bar.
557040	565040	It was packed with peanuts, but it did not satisfy, because ultimately, what is a person
565040	569040	that has never come from that point of view going to do, what is the best job a writer
569040	570040	could ever do?
570040	574040	The best job they could ever do from the most humanitarian instinct in the world is they're
574040	575040	going to write a shitty character.
575040	577040	They're going to write the definition of a shitty character.
577040	581040	They're going to write a character sitting in a chair with wheels on it that happens to
581040	587040	be totally infallible and innocent, and ultimately, it leaves you continuing with sort of a bad
587040	588040	taste in your mouth.
588040	594040	It's like, that's nice to have screen time, but ultimately, kind of part of the problem.
594040	601040	She actually said that they have a phrase for it among the community, they call it inspiration
601040	608040	porn, when there's a character in a wheelchair, and they can do anything.
608040	614040	I remember a different strokes episode where Arnold made friends with a kid in a wheelchair,
614040	618040	and there was the big moment in the different strokes episode where Arnold said, hey, we're
618040	619040	having a good time.
619040	622040	Come on, come upstairs.
622040	623040	I want to show you my goldfish.
623040	628040	And he started running halfway upstairs, and then he turned around, and he said, oh, oh,
628040	630040	God, I forgot.
630040	634040	And the kid in his wheelchair at the bottom of the stairs said, Arnold, that's the best
634040	638040	thing anyone's ever said to me.
638040	643040	And that's sort of where we peaked.
643040	647040	I mean, we haven't really progressed beyond that from the Reagan era in terms of television's
647040	650040	treatment of being differently abled.
650040	655040	What kind of sad life did that wheelchair kid have that that's the best thing anyone ever said?
655040	659040	That's the best thing that could happen to me is you totally fucking forgot what my actual
660040	667040	It's not, you know, it's like it's yeah, but I don't want to throw that under the bus because at
667040	669040	least somebody was doing something even at that point.
669040	672040	But but I just want to break.
672040	677040	I'm bringing this up, not because I don't want to talk to the my fellow fat white straight male
677040	680040	writers that are out there like like we should just go.
680040	681040	We'll keep doing what we're doing.
681040	687040	But I really, God damn it, if you're if you're if you're if you have the slightest thing wrong with
687040	690040	you, start writing, God damn it.
690040	697040	Because all of TV is written by people who are just the the the the the career is one of privilege.
697040	700040	You know, it takes a support system to pursue a career in writing.
700040	709040	And so if you do find yourself like wondering why television stinks for you personally, like if you
709040	716040	can muster it at all, if you can weather that storm, like get that get that script out there, mother.
716040	721040	The because, I mean, once somebody goes to prison and then writes about it, we get to have an orange is
721040	726040	the new black and we don't have to sit and occupy our minds with questions about whether or not it's
726040	728040	authentic and blah, blah, blah.
728040	731040	And progress starts to happen in terms of television.
731040	735040	Like what we really want is just is just transparency and honesty and stuff.
735040	740040	So I just I was I was I was taken with that most of all the communicon people.
740040	744040	They always my heart goes up and down and go all over the walls.
744040	750040	You know, people you'll never have such an intense minute with one person as you do.
750040	754040	And somebody is like watching your broadcast network television show.
754040	756040	They have one minute to explain to you.
756040	758040	My brother committed suicide.
758040	759040	This got me through this.
759040	764040	They they these things that aren't meant to be fit into the can of one minute.
764040	765040	They have to be.
765040	767040	Otherwise, they how do you deal with that?
767040	768040	What do you how do you deal with that?
768040	770040	Because that is an easy for me.
770040	772040	I'm just sitting there going, oh, that's great.
772040	779040	Sounds like a good job getting over it.
779040	783040	Glad I could help.
783040	786040	Looks like I nailed it.
786040	790040	Oh, do you want a picture?
790040	794040	They're the ones trying to explain to someone.
794040	798040	You created something that like really meant something to me.
798040	804040	And their bodies tremor a tremble and they and their and their eyes water and their and their and their spines shake.
804040	809040	And they because they eat everything so symbolic and it's not I haven't earned that.
809040	810040	It has nothing to do with me.
810040	811040	It's the show.
811040	813040	It's a show that 200 people make over five years.
813040	816040	And it's like it means something to me.
816040	818040	And they have that one moment.
818040	823040	They vibrate like a like a like a transmission is like it's overwhelmed.
823040	824040	They're the ones that have the challenge.
824040	827040	I just think Robert Zemeck has gone.
827040	828040	Oh, yeah.
828040	832040	Delurians are great.
832040	840040	I frankly enjoy it because it would make me feel like a worse person if a line of people came up and said your job.
840040	846040	Your job makes me doing nothing worth everything.
846040	852040	Like I it's a way for me to trick myself into thinking with being a rich writer writing you know,
852040	857040	opiate for the masses is like actually not what it is like because someone's going like no man.
857040	861040	My my mom left my dad and I was all fucked up and your show helped me.
861040	862040	I'm like I see.
862040	866040	I told you I was a good person.
866040	873040	I did that with Lou Barlow once I freaked out and did like the transmission breaking down when I got around Lou Barlow in L.A.
873040	881040	when I met him and it was the most humiliating mortifying moment in my life because I went to him trying to express this idea
881040	887040	that oh fuck your music got me through so much and helped me feel like I wasn't insane.
887040	892040	And it came out like I just you're so great man.
892040	896040	I just sit and he looked at me like OK.
896040	903040	It was awful because I failed that bad and even talking that I embarrassed both of us and it was an awkward moment.
903040	905040	And his friends looked.
905040	907040	Everyone was like fuck.
907040	914040	But I guess it like rains on him like that like hipsters come up stammering to him nonstop.
914040	920040	I don't think I assuming Lou Barlow is exactly like me.
920040	925040	I would wager that the response that you're to under which you're projecting.
925040	928040	Oh I fucked up and they're they're like you're a jerk.
928040	937040	What what you're perceiving is them going like I can't do anything with simply the root message that what's what's happening right now is difficult for you.
937040	940040	I all I can do is stand continue to stand by.
940040	941040	Right.
941040	951040	Like because what would you say if so if somebody said this is really difficult for me I don't know what to do like like my Wisconsin fiber will not allow me to say it's OK.
951040	952040	Just let it out.
952040	958040	There's nothing nothing I can say that won't make me a douche you know except so I'll just silence is what you need to do.
958040	960040	You just go like all right.
960040	961040	OK.
961040	970040	But then I think if you are that nervous as we all have been if I got in an elevator with Bob Oden Kirk or Bill Murray or something I like I have I have been in this situation.
970040	976040	I have made an ass of myself and because I wanted to say so many things and have one minute to say them.
977040	979040	I think that then in those moments.
981040	982040	Hey calm down.
985040	986040	All right.
986040	987040	I'm trying to talk about something.
997040	999040	Maybe we'll put a pin in what I was discussing.
1006040	1020040	Because I a friend of mine thought it might be a good idea to drop by and I said hey if you can poke your head they have somebody give me the high side and he just stepped into the spotlight.
1021040	1023040	Oh I didn't know what I was like.
1023040	1026040	Oh you've been in an elevator with Bob Oden Kirk.
1027040	1029040	You're freaking out.
1030040	1031040	Oh I get it now.
1031040	1035040	Well let's all get into an elevator right now with Joel McHale.
1062040	1063040	Yeah.
1064040	1065040	Yeah.
1066040	1067040	Yeah.
1067040	1068040	Double mic.
1068040	1069040	Yeah.

1129040	1130040	Hello Jeff.
1130040	1131040	Hello.
1131040	1132040	I'm not Jeff.
1134040	1137040	That'd be amazing if Jeff changed into this somehow.
1138040	1140040	It would be a weird turn for him.
1141040	1143040	Have you ever met Duncan Tressel.
1143040	1144040	Have I.
1144040	1146040	Have I ever met Duncan Tressel.
1146040	1147040	No we.
1147040	1148040	Yeah.
1148040	1150040	I saw you at a party but we never.
1150040	1151040	I want to dance house.

1152040	1153040	Dancehouse.
1153040	1154040	Oh yeah.
1154040	1155040	We had a great conversation.
1155040	1156040	It was.
1156040	1157040	We didn't.
1157040	1158040	No I don't remember.
1158040	1159040	We didn't talk.
1159040	1160040	All right.
1160040	1161040	You seem terrific.
1161040	1162040	Yeah.
1162040	1163040	I seem lovely.
1163040	1164040	How was Communicon today everyone.
1168040	1169040	Yeah.
1170040	1173040	I talked to a person in a wheelchair.
1173040	1174040	Oh sorry.
1174040	1176040	I did great.
1176040	1178040	No no it's good.
1178040	1179040	Oh sorry.
1179040	1181040	How much longer did they have.
1187040	1190040	Until they finish their modern family spec.
1191040	1192040	Only three weeks.
1192040	1193040	She's out there.
1193040	1194040	Lara.
1194040	1195040	Now the pressure's on.
1195040	1198040	Are we going to have a person in a wheelchair for a community
1198040	1200040	that's what I was talking about right before you came.
1200040	1203040	It was like you know I want to I want to I want to be the I
1203040	1206040	would like to be the sitcom that does that in a way that
1206040	1209040	doesn't make everyone feel like a goddamn asshole.
1209040	1210040	Yeah.
1210040	1213040	I feel I hate the fact that.
1213040	1214040	Yeah.
1214040	1215040	I don't know.
1215040	1218040	We had we brainstormed in the room once.
1218040	1221040	We were talking about the Down syndrome thing like there are
1221040	1224040	sitcoms we've seen characters with Down syndrome come on
1224040	1227040	screen and it's it's also like oh these are some of the most
1227040	1230040	joyful entertaining people in the world.
1230040	1233040	But there's this social stigma where you feel like if you're
1233040	1235040	laughing because of a person with Down syndrome that you're
1235040	1238040	laughing at them and they're automatically a bully.
1238040	1241040	So one of the most ironic things in the world happens because I
1241040	1244040	don't think it's politically incorrect to say that that
1244040	1251040	that Down syndrome people are generally like incredibly
1251040	1254040	joyful people that cause a lot of mirth in people.
1254040	1258040	It is like one of the very positive side effects of it.
1258040	1262040	And the people that work with them are the ones that say so.
1262040	1265040	So I'm not too worried about saying that.
1265040	1275040	The this when you see them on TV it's again it's like okay
1275040	1276040	clear the runway.
1276040	1277040	Let's all be cool.
1277040	1279040	The president's in town.
1279040	1280040	Let's cool it.
1281040	1284040	The question becomes like how would how would 30 Rock have a
1284040	1288040	Down syndrome character and not be like you know pandering and
1288040	1289040	stuff like that.
1289040	1291040	We had taught we had talked to the writers room a community
1291040	1294040	about like this you know we're like what what would it be.
1294040	1297040	And I was like what if you made them a huge asshole.
1297040	1299040	What we were going to do is we were going to create a character
1299040	1303040	named Michael who was like just the guy that like he comes in
1303040	1307040	and he just every time the dean wants to tell everybody
1307040	1309040	something shitty he sends Michael.
1310040	1318040	So Michael comes in and it's just like like if the teacher's
1318040	1320040	salaries are getting lowered.
1320040	1321040	The lunch menu.
1321040	1323040	Tell me you'll do that.
1323040	1327040	How often do you say things here that actually wind up there.
1327040	1328040	Yeah well plenty.
1328040	1330040	That would be great.
1330040	1331040	Yeah.
1331040	1332040	OK.
1332040	1333040	Well yeah.
1333040	1334040	OK.
1334040	1335040	Well that was a good market test.
1335040	1336040	They responded well to that.
1336040	1337040	We like it.
1338040	1341040	I feel like that that way it's like everyone's in on the joke.
1341040	1342040	Nobody's being made fun of.
1342040	1346040	It's like the joke becomes how society perceives and what what
1346040	1348040	all society is kind of strange.
1348040	1349040	Cathexes and things.
1349040	1353040	I also want you know how do you do that with people who are
1353040	1355040	physically differently able to just.
1355040	1358040	Have you seen the new American horror story.
1358040	1359040	No.
1359040	1360040	It's amazing.
1360040	1363040	And I know Jessica Lange is so strange.
1363040	1365040	That what you're talking about.
1365040	1366040	No but it is super cool.
1366040	1370040	And they use people who have actual disabilities and it's
1370040	1371040	and it's amazing.
1371040	1373040	And it's not it doesn't seem exploitive at all.
1373040	1374040	Yeah.
1374040	1375040	Chevy's on the show.
1379040	1380040	You're right.
1380040	1381040	Too soon.
1383040	1386040	I mean within three years it'll be too late.
1389040	1392040	Now is the time to make these jokes people.
1393040	1395040	Chevy would appreciate these jokes.
1396040	1397040	He would love these.
1397040	1398040	Yeah.
1398040	1400040	He would be the first to be to be laughing at them.
1400040	1401040	Yes.
1401040	1404040	And by laughing I mean you know calling us fat queers.
1407040	1409040	His way of responding positively.
1410040	1411040	The term of affection.
1412040	1413040	That was his Christmas card.
1415040	1416040	I love you you fat queer.
1418040	1419040	Chevy.
1420040	1423040	So what have you been up to between during during
1423040	1424040	communities death.

1426040	1427040	Your Easter.
1431040	1432040	Well I saw my grandma.
1433040	1434040	She's 95.
1435040	1436040	I did a lot.
1436040	1437040	She's great.
1437040	1438040	Racist.
1439040	1440040	She has to be.
1441040	1443040	If she was now my grandma will.
1444040	1447040	My this is my 95 year old grandma.
1447040	1448040	She will go.
1448040	1450040	Why do you have to say fuck so much.
1451040	1453040	And I was like I just fucking have to grandma.
1454040	1455040	I don't know.
1455040	1462040	You know I think I'm sure you've told the story a million times but we didn't know it was going to be picked up until the last hour.
1462040	1463040	Yeah.
1463040	1468040	It was like at 4 30 in the afternoon on the last half hour of the contracts where they went.
1468040	1472040	Yahoo has bought the show with pelts not with cash.
1473040	1476040	They use Beaver pelts.
1477040	1480040	Yeah it was weird that and Sony's like great we're doing it.
1480040	1485040	So I've been we I bought a house so I've been doing a lot of stand up to pay for that.
1486040	1490040	And seeing my children I have a nine and six year old.
1490040	1491040	Yeah weird.
1492040	1495040	That doesn't that doesn't deserve clapping.
1496040	1498040	You can actually be a terrible parent for nine years.
1498040	1499040	You'll still have a nine year old.
1499040	1500040	Thanks.
1500040	1501040	Yeah you're right.
1502040	1503040	It's been done all over the world.
1503040	1506040	No I have a baby I just shook it for hours.
1507040	1509040	I shook it for nine years.
1509040	1511040	The result a shaken nine year old child.
1512040	1513040	Same results.
1515040	1518040	But we went to dinner two nights ago three nights ago.
1518040	1522040	Yeah we had terrible octopus terrible octopus but everything else was terrific.
1522040	1523040	Yeah man.
1523040	1526040	Oh did you guys hear about the family that ate puffer fish.
1526040	1528040	And did you hear about this.
1528040	1529040	It's terrible.
1529040	1537040	This family had puffer fish and there you have to be you have to train as a chef for two years to serve this stuff.
1537040	1543040	But it's a very sad story like their uncle caught it and they're disgusting looking fish.
1543040	1545040	But the family someone's like it looked delicious.
1545040	1547040	It seemed like it'd be amazing.
1547040	1552040	But they ate it and within five minutes all of them were paralyzed and having seizures.
1552040	1554040	And they're all in the hospital now.
1554040	1559040	So octopus I don't know made me think of deadly puffer fish.
1560040	1565040	So when you look up I went through a day where I was like wait a minute puffer fish blowfish what's going on.
1565040	1566040	Like is there.
1566040	1567040	What is the thing that I looked into it.
1567040	1568040	It's like puffer fish and blowfish.
1568040	1570040	It's kind of like it's all part of the same thing.
1570040	1572040	I think it's the same.
1572040	1574040	Yeah I just remember that Simpsons episode.
1574040	1583040	Basically there's like a there's like a whole kind of family of fish all of whom puff up as a defense mechanism and all of whom are deadly poisonous.
1583040	1586040	And apparently incredibly delicious.
1586040	1591040	I read a thing where the puffer fish poison it.
1591040	1596040	If you cut the fish correctly it just tingles the edge of your lips and your mouth.
1596040	1599040	And if it's cut right you swallow it and you're fine.
1599040	1600040	Who fucking cares.
1600040	1601040	It doesn't matter.
1601040	1605040	There's nothing there's nothing that's no way there's nothing that's worth that.
1605040	1607040	There's no nothing tastes that good.
1607040	1609040	Nothing tastes that good.
1610040	1616040	There's that thing where you eat the eat the partially fertilized bird egg rich people.
1616040	1617040	Right.
1617040	1627040	And then the baby bird bones they the baby bird bones cut your mouth and your own blood is the is the is part of the delicacy.
1627040	1636040	That is so stupid or like the cat poop coffee where the cat or the some sort of animal eats the coffee beans.
1636040	1639040	It poops it out and then that is your coffee.
1639040	1640040	I've had that.
1640040	1641040	You've had your seat.
1641040	1642040	But you'd like you're an idiot right.
1645040	1647040	You ate something that something shit.
1647040	1650040	Well you'd be surprised.
1650040	1653040	You'd be surprised how much of an idiot I am.
1655040	1659040	If someone offers you this rare coffee even if it's been shit out of it.
1659040	1661040	I think it's weasels that eat it actually.
1661040	1665040	But if someone offers you coffee beans that have been shit out of rare weasels.
1666040	1668040	You drink it.
1669040	1672040	No that common weasel coffee is bad.
1672040	1673040	Right.
1674040	1676040	But by the way it just tastes like coffee.
1677040	1679040	It actually tastes like chicken coffee.
1681040	1690040	I feel like if anyone said this is very rare and I'm like waiting for the next thing and there's like it was shit out of a weasel.
1690040	1692040	I would go like I'm good.
1692040	1695040	I don't need you got to live a little man.
1696040	1702040	And I if Dan will attest I'll eat I'll eat almost anything but but not that.
1702040	1703040	But that's great.
1703040	1705040	But you have your hipster beard and your friends and all that.
1706040	1708040	And I can't compete with that.
1709040	1711040	No no infighting in Hermitown.
1711040	1713040	We're all we're all we're all we're all.
1713040	1714040	What.
1719040	1721040	You just became the greatest politician of all time.
1722040	1723040	Because we were in fighting.
1723040	1724040	We're like what's he going to say.
1724040	1725040	We're all distracted.
1730040	1731040	I forgot what we were fighting about.
1732040	1733040	Drone strike.
1734040	1735040	Well you weren't looking.
1735040	1736040	Drone strikes for everybody.

1750040	1751040	I don't know what that is.
1752040	1755040	Is that about a guy who every morning he cuts himself shaving.
1757040	1760040	And the blood like shows him a crime that's going to happen.
1763040	1764040	No.
1765040	1766040	No.
1767040	1768040	It's not what it is.
1769040	1775040	It's about a guy that cuts himself every morning and his droplet of blood becomes the newspaper from tomorrow.
1776040	1777040	OK.
1778040	1779040	Get it straight.
1782040	1783040	No.
1790040	1791040	What is The Nick.
1792040	1801040	Steven Soderbergh directed 10 episodes of this I guess mini series about Clive Owen stars about surgery in 1895.
1802040	1806040	Very similar to communities new season on Yahoo screen.

1839040	1846040	So you can just watch a person who was born with like a unicorn horn have it removed while they scream.
1846040	1847040	Please don't.
1848040	1851040	This is this is the only this is the only thing that makes me special.
1852040	1857040	It's just it's just hacksawed off by a leather apron freemason.
1857040	1859040	I would watch that show.
1859040	1860040	I wouldn't watch.

1882040	1883040	Notice. Yeah.
1883040	1886040	That's the cotton candy vodka everyone's talking about.
1887040	1888040	Straight to vomit sir.
1889040	1895040	But I don't understand about here's something I don't. Here's one of the eight hundred and fifty three thousand things I don't understand about Dan Aykroyd.
1899040	1903040	I wish he he he decided to create his own vodka.
1903040	1907040	He bottles it in a really expensive skull bottle.
1907040	1909040	It's not that great vodka.
1909040	1912040	No it's no purity vodka.
1913040	1925040	I just it just seems like it's all like bad business like it seems weird because when growing up when you watch Dan Aykroyd do the bass omatic or I don't know.
1926040	1933040	Ghostbusters you're like that is a guy that needs to sell me a spirit in the shape of a skull.
1934040	1938040	But at no point did you ever think of a skull when you thought of Dan Aykroyd.
1939040	1940040	But he's an alien.
1941040	1949040	That's like that's a he believes that they're aliens and that the crystal skull is some kind of ancient artifact that aliens have left around.
1950040	1951040	He's heavily into that stuff very much believes in it.
1952040	1959040	There's a there's a documentary where like a neighbor of his like had a camcorder and just shot Dan Aykroyd talking about aliens for two hours.
1961040	1964040	You can watch that like like like that doesn't sound boring at all.
1965040	1968040	I mean Dan Aykroyd is I don't know if he's I think he's officially diagnosed.
1969040	1970040	I think he's you know he's he's out of the closet.
1971040	1972040	Asperger's he's he's a he's a.
1973040	1974040	Did you know that Asperger's has been struck.
1975040	1976040	Yeah it's not a disease anymore.
1977040	1978040	What do you know just a superpower.
1979040	1980040	The Avengers.
1981040	1982040	It's not it's not the diagnostic manual anymore.
1983040	1986040	It's just like they're like OK never mind it's just different grades of autism.
1987040	1988040	Right right right right.
1989040	1991040	So what he's been fully diagnosed.
1991040	1994040	What we used to call Asperger's you can now all go back to calling dork.
1997040	1998040	We had a shining moment.
1999040	2000040	I said we like I'm diagnosing myself.
2001040	2002040	The Dan Aykroyd.
2003040	2005040	Yeah apparently also Spielberg.
2006040	2007040	I don't know.
2007040	2008040	I looked it up.
2009040	2012040	Supposedly Spielberg also and he all diagnosed Asperger's.
2013040	2014040	I noticed that in Blues Brothers.
2015040	2016040	Aykroyd like this.
2016040	2020040	The original script for Ghostbusters is like five hundred thousand pages long.
2021040	2033040	And it's like it's it's like it when you can look it up look online about it like like like Aykroyd's vision of Ghostbusters minus Ivan Reitman kind of coming in or I don't know who's to credit.
2034040	2037040	It's all good movies are sort of a collaborative like fluke.
2038040	2041040	I think there's no there's no there's rarely like an auteur behind any of it.
2042040	2045040	It's all sort of like that's because that's why good movies are so rare.
2045040	2051040	But but like Aykroyd's original vision is like in the form of this gigantic compendium.
2052040	2072040	And same with Blues Brothers like if you watch the Blues Brothers behind the scenes stuff there's like he had this whole scene that he had in mind for the Blues Brothers that would explain why the Blues Mobile was able to go faster than cop cars and it involved like the car being parked between electric pylons overnight.
2073040	2075040	I didn't show like electricity zapping the car.
2076040	2081040	I guess very much kind of go like man I like Dan Aykroyd way more than I thought I did.
2082040	2086040	And also but I like he's he's a way worse writer than I thought he was.
2088040	2091040	Yeah it's like he's he's sort of he's he's out there.
2092040	2099040	He loves the aliens and the ghosts and the sci-fi and like I would love to see a five hundred thousand page Ghostbusters movie.
2099040	2103040	It would be like Watership Down just this get go on and on and on.
2104040	2113040	I mean he would be that would be a dream guest to have on the show if Dan Aykroyd would come and just just just just pop the cork let him loose let him talk about the aliens and the crystal skulls and stuff.
2114040	2118040	I think Kettle One would feel about it if he brought up his vodka.
2119040	2121040	I don't think they're like worried about bad PR.
2122040	2128040	I think maybe if I hit a baby with my car with your car or your what did you say your car.
2129040	2139040	I think if I hit a baby with my cock channel one will pull out their marketing agreement.
2141040	2145040	I agree with that. I think they'll go. Yeah.
2146040	2154040	All right. What else is going on. Oh that Dick Cheney's up to his old tricks again. He is. How about those Seahawks today.
2154040	2161040	Whoa Seahawks. Wow. Football is a sport.
2162040	2172040	Don't talk down to them. He's talking down to them. I literally cannot help but talk down to them since I am at a higher elevation than them. Don't brag about your height.
2173040	2175040	I'm on a high job on a stage.
2177040	2183040	We don't like sports. Were you in Houston last night. I was in Houston. Yeah. How'd it go. It's all right. Just all right.
2184040	2195040	No it's all right. But not. I accidentally called them Austin. Oh hell no. That got us off on the wrong foot.
2196040	2210040	I love. I was in Canada which is a state just north of here. No I was in Canada and I went to Montreal and I thought I would. It was a TV special and I opened it up by saying hello Toronto.
2211040	2222040	And they were like. Oh fuck you in French. You can't. But I just thought you're in the same country assholes. You hate your own country. You hate your own city and you're like tech.
2223040	2236040	Everything about Texas. I was like I love Texas. Texas is my you know it could be a country if I wanted to be. But they hate. But we're gonna hate this other city that's in our own state. Yeah but civic pride is its own brand of pride. If you go to Milwaukee and call it Madison.
2237040	2244040	It's like oh you're what you're saying is I'm a rich asshole who got dropped in by a helicopter. I don't know where the fuck I am. That's that's what they're booing. I see.
2245040	2258040	I was like it was totally true. I had just driven three hours from Austin to Houston and was like so proud of myself was like listen it's great. It's great to be at the Alamo draft house. They have Alamo draft houses everywhere in fucking Texas.
2258040	2269040	So it's like you're you don't you can't. I was just like look all I see is awesome nerds and hipsters like that love cinema and Quentin Tarantino posters like I kind of did think I was in Austin.
2270040	2283040	I forgot I was just there three hours earlier. Right. And I was like I was like yeah man it was great. Great to be here at this theater. It's great to be here in Austin and all this stuff. And they were just like oh it was so sad. They didn't like boo me. They're not like kill them.
2284040	2298040	No you could just see him be here. But then they came up to me at the intermission. They were like look we're we're from Houston. It's worse things could happen than to be mistaken for Austin. They're very nice people. They're the Milwaukee of Texas.
2299040	2306040	Did you see the Reddit article about the Illuminati room in this Houston hotel. No I have a life. No.
2307040	2326040	He's great. I don't know why Joe McHale hates me but it's incredible. You have no other job other than to receive my horrible insults. I feel honored people had a mirror way worse than you. Look at them. Well I think you might be in the Illuminati friend. I am my friend.
2326040	2355040	You better cut your hair hippie. I was about to say you want to be a part of us about this day. You have a very reptilian haircut. If I was a reptilian that's exactly how I cut my head. It only comes out when the sun shines. Wow. Wait no. So tell what was the Reddit thing. Well somebody went to this hotel in Houston and they gave them this room that had an obvious two way mirror built into the wall like it was a mirror in the wall and all these really creepy like pictures that wouldn't be in a hotel room.
2356040	2382040	All these spooky pictures. The floor was concrete had what appeared to be blood stains on it. The guy started taking pictures and immediately posting them on Reddit. Thank God. And then the hotel called and said we gave you the wrong room and move them to a room. Yeah. Look it up. It's amazing. And then after it went up on Reddit and went viral the hotel was like that's just a theme room that we have. It's a theme room. But there's like it's the Austin theme room.
2383040	2402040	But there was like a picture of like a on the wall is a frame picture of a guy who'd been convicted of like a lot of like white collar crime some kind of oil man had gotten in a lot of trouble and just it was shouldn't have been a hotel room. So it was like what a weird fetish to get off on.
2403040	2426040	Oh that dude that white collar criminal. Oh man. I know it's a really so but the number of the room I can't remember the number of the room but it was somehow connected to the skull and bones and you know it's so like people are saying oh this is like an Illuminati kill room where people who want to strangle a hooker like stab someone to death pay a lot for the room. And so that was Houston.
2427040	2445040	That can't be like that cannot be you. You told me at one point you told me about the there was the first cybernetic hate crime happened in Paris where like a guy was like a cyborg and they tried to rip his thing out. But it was just a guy who had chosen to bolt his Google Glass to his ear.
2446040	2466040	And it was like three years. I had that drilled into his face. I tried to get it. I was actually trying to write this article for vice and I wanted to interview that guy about what happened but it was actually drilled into the bone of his face. He didn't have it on his ear. It was in his head. So maybe it was on his ear was the name of the article. Hey I met an idiot.
2467040	2469040	I don't know what that means.
2470040	2479040	You don't know what that means. He drilled into his head. Oh the cyborg. Oh no. I was still reeling from when you call me an idiot earlier.
2480040	2491040	Is this like another McHale jab? He called me the Illuminati and I was playing along with it. I have to I have a responsibility here to explain. You guys have a kind of antithetical style like like Joel.
2491040	2515040	Joel. Joel. Joel. Joel. Like as a as a bio. I'm a. I'm a velociraptor. Joel. Joel is a great very hardworking very charming very sexually appealing man with a beautiful man giant chest and arms the size of my head.
2516040	2528040	But he only like comedically all he knows is making fun of your clothes or you're like he just kind of like his instinct is it's just like you're like you're like hey what's up with your teeth.
2529040	2541040	Fuck you fuck face. I can't help it. It's beautiful. I can't help it. I have children. Imagine how they feel every morning. He hosts the suit. Look I've got elves living in my home.
2541040	2552040	Hey kids wake up. Joel. Joel McHale was auditioning for the role of Jeff Winger and it was like we were going through the folly the formality of testing him against other actors.
2553040	2565040	And Joel comes into the comes into the room and immediately like there's like 30 people in the room but they're all executives from Sony and NBC and Joel just went around the room and ridiculed every.
2566040	2580040	I love that. I just pointed at every the highest like you had a fair Monal ability to zero in on the highest ranking people and I was like hell. Good. Good to see Frank Stallone's here. That was the head of Sony.
2581040	2596040	Hey would it kill you to wear a tie. That was the head of NBC and I just worked in the room and it was great. It was funny and that's that's that's Joel's style because I'm crying inside. You can't let it get to you Duncan Trussell.
2597040	2607040	I love it. It's amazing. It's a flat. I'm honestly flattered by it. I think it's fucking cool. I think I like it. You're a sweetie Joel McHale. I can feel the love inside of you radiating out.
2607040	2623040	Not love. It's the only way I know how to behave. I want to be like that. I'm terrified. I can I can never I could never pull that off. I always wish I was more mean. I would like to be. Well we can start right now. I can teach you.
2624040	2642040	This just seems worthwhile. Let's teach Duncan Trussell how to be me. All right. Give it. All right. Let's do it. Pick someone from the audience. I can't do that. I'm not doing that. That's what you have to start with. You start with an innocence.
2643040	2658040	Just take the Illuminati. That's the only way it will work. OK. Is there anyone in the audience who feels like they will make it. Father him. All right. Come on up here. Genius. All right. So don't sit so close to me.
2658040	2687040	Don't sit so close to me. You're learning. Take one. Yeah. All right. Go ahead. Ask him a question. So are you enjoying the show so far. Now wait. Whatever his answer is. It's wrong. You're doing great so far. It's good.
2688040	2703040	For the show. I'm enjoying myself. Well the show fucking sucks. Yeah. Idiot. Great. Good. Good. Good. Good. That doesn't make me feel good. Well how could you feel good. You're wearing all black. What are you a fucking asshole.
2704040	2729040	Nice. Nice. I'm sorry. This guy's amazing. Don't apologize. Don't apologize you idiot. What are you doing. Luke Skywalker didn't didn't shoot a laser into the Death Star and then pull it back. Oh no. Use the force you fucking prick. Ask him his name. What's your name. Ethan.
2729040	2758040	Yeah. Think of another person named Ethan that you don't like. Ethan Allen shitty furniture. What do they sell jewelry furniture. What do you sell furniture. You ask him why his facial hair doesn't match his head hair at all. Yeah. Well now you're just feeding him. All right. That's all I got. No no. You have to come up with a question for him.
2758040	2784020	So how long have you been the biggest asshole of the show. I didn't. I'm so sorry. I would never say anything like that. That is horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible. It's
2784020	2798300	Vincent van Gogh, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He did look a little bit like Vincent van Gogh. See, there's glimmers of genius in it. He looked like Vincent van Gogh.
2798300	2828280	That was I can't wait to see how this newfound power in exchange will affect our meeting with Spencer Crittenden. Hey, hey, what's up, everybody? All right. All right. That's a bit much. I think they're doing it because you're still clapping.
2828300	2858280	Good to see you. Hey, guys. Man, last night I was starving and I was reduced to it was like three in the morning and I was trapped in a hotel. And was there a Texas billionaires picture for boiled down? There was certainly a buyer's club involved. But no, I was really at rock bottom. I was starving. I couldn't I was too hungry to get to sleep. So I was I was reduced to eating the apple I used as a pipe.
2858300	2888080	In the hotel. That's the original Thanksgiving, isn't it? It was delicious, though. No, it wasn't. It was a green apple. Those are the worst. Was it was? Oh, man. Apple enthusiasts. You just got booed for saying green apples. Okay, what's the worst? The red, red, delicious? Are those Washington red or worse than green
2888080	2917700	apples? But other than that, I'm from Washington. It's a well, I don't think Washington ruined their apples. I think other people intervened. I agree. I retract. But I'm curious, what was gross about the was it that it was a green apple? Or was it that was its use of a as a pipe that made it? No, that made it great. Okay. That's what I was curious about. No, I couldn't. I couldn't tell you. You would never tell someone smoked out of it other than the the blackened charred
2917700	2947440	holes in the sides. But no, it was it was a green apples are gross and they have thick skin. I hate apples, I think. Oranges are better if I were to have to compare the two. Yeah, but an orange pie, an orange pipe doesn't seem like it would. Well, you'd be surprised. But when we were in San Francisco, I did not have access to an apple. So I hit up a 711 and got other fruits. Namely, a banana and a lime and a lime worked a lot better.
2947440	2956940	Why don't you buy some rolling papers? I my hands get too sweaty, and it literally disintegrates the the paper as I roll it. And then I just have a pants full of weed.
2963420	2972980	God damn it. Now I forgot what I was gonna ask. Oh, sorry. No, it's not your fault. I feel like it was. No, hey, that's because you're brain dead, you shithead. Yeah, there you go.
2977440	2990260	Thank you. Duncan Tribble, everyone.
2990260	3010060	Roast. I hope we can hit the reset button on on Duncan after the show is done. Because I love let's bring up Vincent Gallo again. Let's see what he has.
3010060	3039940	So I want to plug something real quick. I think the next episode that airs of Brooklyn 99, unless they added me out, I'm in. They probably did edit me out because I can't act. So you know, pretty good job in community. Hey, I don't need any of that. No, I really. It just makes me feel like every. You did a shitty job in community.
3039940	3068940	Thank you. Thank you. You did great. I appreciate it. You're a professional actor. So you know, I would know if you sucked. Yeah. Holy shit. I guess I can do it. It's I mean, you just got when a bunch of when a bunch of rabble like these is into you. It's just like, oh, it's just a bunch of people that are wrong about stuff. Yeah, but I want to I really want to know about that Illuminati Hotel room.
3069940	3083940	There's no quick Google search. I mean, yeah, somebody you guys are always yelling and yelling stuff out. Somebody get in here. Get in your Google Tory spelling. No. All right. What do you got? Yeah. Well, you got information. Can you?
3085940	3094940	Well, are the father photos posted as well? Yeah. Why don't you bring it? Can you? Are you willing to bring it up here? We won't. We won't. We won't mock you. Well, I guess.
3094940	3123940	What's your, what's your name? Ben. All right. I have a microphone and I'm going to give you the one that smells like cereal. This is most like cereal. Ben's got a chain. Glorious bastards t-shirt on. Yeah. So if we alienate him, we've lost one fifth of our audience for the six season. All right. So it's all right. But discoveries. Oh, making that is really weird. Well, it's okay.
3124940	3153940	It's way weird. And I thought it would be, these are actual photos from the hotel room. Yeah. It's a podcast. I don't know if it's going to translate very well. I think they can get the idea. It's going to be like a hoax. All right. I'll interview Ben while you're looking at the photos. I can describe the, so Ben judging from your haircuts. There's no way. I'll let, actually, I'll let Duncan take a swing. You're a, you, you, you look like a gerbil.
3154940	3183940	I'm sorry. I can't do it. I love you, man. I'm sorry. I mean, you and Duncan, how is the shooting of black sails going? I don't know. God, I don't know what that is. It's a show. Oh, pirate show. Never. It doesn't matter now. You're a sweetheart. I can't do the mean. I work at a library. That's good. Reading's good. You can be nice. He helps people get books. That's good. This is all a setup. Come on. Keep going.
3184940	3185940	Ben, how old are you?
3185940	3186940	29.
3186940	3187940	All right.
3189940	3190940	No, I don't think so.
3191940	3193940	I wasn't paying attention. I was looking at the pictures.
3193940	3194940	It's very creepy.
3194940	3196940	It's creepy. They're out there, man.
3196940	3198940	What do you make of this idea, Spencer? Do you think?
3198940	3199940	Which idea?
3199940	3205940	Well, this idea that a guy got checked into a hotel room that turned out to accidentally be in an Illuminati hotel room.
3205940	3207940	He posted about it on Reddit.
3207940	3209940	Then he's wrong. He's a fucking idiot.
3210940	3211440	Why?
3211440	3212940	Because he's on Reddit.
3213940	3214940	Oh, hell no.
3214940	3215940	Shots fired.
3215940	3216940	Bap, bap, bap, bap.
3216940	3217940	Tejasta.
3219940	3220940	Tejasta.
3220940	3221940	Tejasta.
3222940	3223940	Gattaca.
3223940	3224940	Gattaca.
3225940	3227940	Well, the Skull and Bones is a real thing.
3227940	3231940	That's a real secret fraternity that a lot of powerful people have been in.
3231940	3232940	And I heard that you...
3232940	3233940	I know. There was a movie about it.
3233940	3235940	I didn't see that.
3235940	3240940	But I heard you have to lay in a glass coffin and people jerk off on top of the coffin.
3240940	3242940	Oh, well, that sounds true.
3242940	3246940	That's the least severe hazing I've ever heard.
3247940	3252940	They put naked people in freezing water and shit. You just get not jizzed on?
3256940	3259940	I mean, even getting jizzed on doesn't seem as bad as most of the stuff I hear about.
3259940	3267940	I would not want to be laying in a glass coffin looking up at a young George W. Bush spraying jizz on the top of my coffin.
3267940	3268940	Wait a minute.
3268940	3269940	Well, that's where you and I differ.
3269940	3270940	You're in a...
3271940	3281940	But what if I told you that in our society, ultra-rich people get the privilege of getting to sit in a protected chamber
3281940	3288940	while everyone around them is forced to humiliate themselves by jerking off around them
3288940	3294940	and they get to look at their dicks and see them while they're coming without ever being touched by their cum?
3295940	3298940	Yeah. It's truly living the dream.
3299940	3300940	Wait, I have a question.
3300940	3301940	Yeah.
3301940	3303940	Why the fuck is Ben still up here?
3303940	3304940	I was wondering...
3305940	3307940	He brought up the Reddit post and...
3307940	3308940	No, I know.
3308940	3312940	What do you think, Ben? Do you believe that you have a hotel room in the...
3312940	3316940	From the brief moment I looked at this, yeah, sure.
3316940	3317940	Okay.
3317940	3318940	There you go.
3318940	3320940	All right. Let's have a hand for Ben.
3320940	3321940	Ben, everybody!
3321940	3328940	Thank you, Ben.
3330940	3332940	All right. What have we learned tonight?
3332940	3335940	I want handicapped people to write more scripts.
3335940	3338940	A, Joel's mean.
3338940	3340940	The Illuminati is real.
3340940	3343940	I've taught Duncan how to be mean.
3343940	3345940	Duncan is now mean.
3345940	3347940	Duncan is now mean!
3347940	3351940	What a dick!
3351940	3355940	Ben works at a library. We figured that out.
3355940	3357940	Ben has a phone.
3357940	3360940	That guy looks like Vincent Van Gogh.
3360940	3362940	Spencer...
3362940	3365940	He's a skilled artist. Don't complain, man.
3365940	3367940	He's a great artist.
3367940	3371940	Yeah. I wish I was Vincent Van Gogh.
3371940	3374940	I don't know your art. I mean, it might be great.
3374940	3376940	I'm not going to deny it could be.
3376940	3378940	Sorry, audience.
3378940	3380940	I'm wondering what to do with all these episodes,
3380940	3383940	because we went to San Francisco, Austin, and Houston.
3383940	3385940	What have we aired so far, Dustin?
3385940	3388940	We'll start tomorrow, then every two days we'll release it.
3388940	3391940	Okay. We're going to air stuff every two days.
3391940	3395940	You guys got to hear the LaVar Burton episode in Austin.
3395940	3398940	That guy.
3398940	3400940	I don't know how much his projection...
3401940	3403940	I mean, because he's...
3403940	3407940	He's perhaps the most positive person in the history of the world.
3407940	3409940	He makes your knees shake a little bit.
3409940	3412940	You can project a lot of stuff out of that guy if you want to.
3412940	3416940	And he killed Troy in the Lost episodes of Community, right?
3416940	3418940	He ate him on a boat, right?
3418940	3421940	They're not supposed to know that.
3421940	3424940	The Season 6 entirely flashback episode is coming up.
3424940	3428940	And then the Dean sends a Down Syndrome person to tell us the bad news.
3431940	3433940	You know what happens?
3434940	3438940	Dan, what are you going to do in between now and the time we start shooting?
3440940	3442940	I'm writing. What are you talking about?
3442940	3443940	I don't know.
3443940	3446940	Don't you know how TV gets made, you piece of shit?
3446940	3448940	Yeah, you shit in.
3448940	3450940	What the hell?
3452940	3455940	Let's meet somebody that came in from far away.
3455940	3457940	Sarah, I'm going to say...
3457940	3459940	Boston!
3459940	3462940	Wait, hold on, hold on. I have somebody in mind. Hold on.
3462940	3464940	Manitoba!
3465940	3466940	Maine!
3466940	3468940	New Finland.
3468940	3470940	I appreciate you guys coming in from Boston. I do.
3470940	3473940	I wanted to see...
3473940	3476940	I don't know if she's too shy. She doesn't have to come up here.
3476940	3479940	So I want to afford her the option to not come up here.
3479940	3481940	Vincent Gallo. Come on up again.
3481940	3484940	Danielle, say nothing if you don't want to come up.
3484940	3485940	Okay.
3485940	3487940	Danielle, do you want to come up?
3487940	3489940	Danielle!
3494940	3495940	Hi, Danielle.
3495940	3497940	Danielle came all the way from Liverpool.
3497940	3499940	England.
3500940	3501940	Wow.
3502940	3504940	For Communicon.
3504940	3507940	She didn't even come here for a Harmon judge. She wasn't even going to come here tonight.
3507940	3510940	She came for Communicon from Liverpool.
3510940	3512940	That's a community fan.
3516940	3518940	Danielle,
3518940	3520940	with people in your peer group
3520940	3522940	walking around,
3522940	3526940	percentage-wise, how many would know community?
3526940	3528940	Not many.
3528940	3530940	Not very many at all.
3530940	3532940	Okay.
3533940	3535940	I have a question.
3535940	3536940	Danielle.
3536940	3539940	I'm trying to change that. I've got quite a few people into it.
3539940	3540940	Really?
3540940	3541940	Yeah.
3541940	3542940	All right.
3542940	3546940	My question for you is, what does the term Liverpool come from?
3546940	3551940	I don't know. It's the pool of life. That's what our city's name means.
3551940	3553940	Ah, that's nice.
3553940	3556940	Yeah, it's not a pool of livers.
3556940	3560940	It's not like a pool of liquefied liver.
3560940	3565940	I would agree that the liver has done great things for all of us on stage.
3565940	3568940	It is the giver of life to all of us.
3568940	3572940	Yeah, I feel like I need to bathe in a Liverpool
3572940	3575940	if I'm going to keep going.
3575940	3578940	Oh, come on in.
3580940	3585940	It's a real problem here. It has rejuvenate properties.
3585940	3587940	Is that offensive, Danielle?
3587940	3589940	Okay.
3589940	3592940	I just love the...
3592940	3599940	So, yeah, are there Beatles statues in Liverpool?
3599940	3602940	Yes. Everyone's obsessed with the Beatles.
3602940	3609940	Are there, like, bus benches where not enough people can sit on them
3609940	3613940	because there's a fucking Paul McCartney, like, bronze Paul McCartney.
3613940	3618940	Sometimes you go to American cities, you'll be in, like, Spokane, Washington,
3619940	3621940	and you'll be like, how come I can't...
3621940	3624940	What the fuck is this? It's a statue of Mel Blanc?
3624940	3627940	What the fuck?
3627940	3630940	How come it's harder to get my coffee today?
3630940	3634940	It's a statue of, like, some guy...
3634940	3637940	Jim Davis was born here? Okay.
3637940	3640940	All right, fuck Garfield. Fuck my life.
3640940	3643940	Why did this happen?
3643940	3646940	Who's the second most famous man in the Liverpool?
3647940	3649940	Where are the Arctic monkeys from?
3649940	3651940	Not Liverpool.
3651940	3653940	I don't know where they're from.
3653940	3655940	Sheffield!
3655940	3657940	There you go.
3657940	3659940	Elvis Costello's from Liverpool.
3659940	3661940	My dad really likes Elvis.
3661940	3663940	Wow! That's pretty good.
3663940	3666940	Well, I'm Elvis Costello and I want to sing
3666940	3669940	But a place called Liverpool
3669940	3672940	And I want to play guitar and be a Costello
3672940	3675940	Cos my name is Elvis Costello
3675940	3678940	He just rhymed Costello with Costello.
3678940	3680940	Yeah!
3680940	3682940	Could you pretend that Elvis Costello
3682940	3684940	Is from Liverpool?
3684940	3686940	If I'm pulling on Costello
3686940	3689940	Elvis Costello is from Liverpool
3689940	3693940	If I'm pulling on Costello
3693940	3696940	Elvis
3702940	3711940	I got a question for everybody sitting up here.
3711940	3714940	So, like, if you were walking into a public restroom, right?
3714940	3717940	And on the bathroom counter
3717940	3720940	Is a tray of cupcakes
3720940	3723940	Would you eat the cupcakes?
3723940	3725940	I don't know.
3725940	3727940	I don't know.
3727940	3729940	Would you eat the cupcakes?
3729940	3731940	Would you eat the cupcakes?
3731940	3733940	Let's start with Danielle.
3733940	3735940	Yes.
3735940	3737940	You would eat the cupcakes off a bathroom counter?
3737940	3739940	I thought so.
3739940	3741940	I would too, for the record, you know.
3741940	3743940	Duncan?
3743940	3745940	Are they gluten free?
3745940	3747940	Yeah, yeah, they are.
3747940	3749940	Then I'll eat them.
3749940	3751940	Okay.
3751940	3754940	I mean, Joel hasn't eaten a cupcake since 1982.
3755940	3758940	A, and B, like I would be in a public fucking bathroom.
3762940	3765940	Joel hasn't been in a public bathroom, right?
3767940	3772940	The last time you peed was Rupert Murdoch's shit teleported you to the moon.
3772940	3776940	So, say you're on Mars and a Pegasus walks up
3776940	3780940	And begins, and offers you a cigar. Would you take it?
3781940	3783940	You're the same age as me.
3783940	3785940	You work as hard as me.
3785940	3788940	You're very much more handsome than me.
3788940	3790940	But you're an actor. I'm a writer.
3790940	3795940	But you hobnob with the fact that I got my job back
3795940	3799940	Is because you're a more politically facile man than I am.
3799940	3803940	You are friends with the people that I hate.
3805940	3807940	I'm so curious about that.
3807940	3810940	You go on their yachts, you go golfing with them.
3810940	3812940	That makes you sound like a dude.
3812940	3814940	We go golfing on their yachts.
3814940	3816940	That's how big their yachts are.
3816940	3819940	You're like a networker. You know how to do it.
3819940	3822940	You're a charmer. You're a diplomat. You're Jeff Winger.
3822940	3825940	How do you think I got Danielle up here tonight?
3826940	3829940	I mean, how do you keep the bile down in your stomach
3829940	3832940	When you're talking to a captain of industry?
3832940	3834940	Because the bile tastes like champagne, my friend.
3838940	3841940	Excuse me, Rosé Champagne.
3842940	3844940	Dan, there was no other option.
3844940	3847940	To not have you back would have been
3847940	3851940	Much like a Japanese general in World War II.
3851940	3854940	It was either victory or suicide.
3854940	3857940	You can look up your history because that's what they would do.
3857940	3859940	If they didn't win the battle, they would kill themselves.
3859940	3862940	Did you have to do shameful things to get me back?
3863940	3866940	Not in my mind, but a lot of your mind.
3867940	3870940	You laid in the glass coffin.
3871940	3873940	Without the lid.
3874940	3876940	Open casket.
3878940	3881940	And I was the one who removed the lid.
3887940	3891940	I see a coming of a coming at its glass
3891940	3893940	With all your comes of me
3893940	3895940	And all the comforts of glass
3895940	3899940	Cannot protect me from inseminy and radical.
3901940	3903940	If you were the recording mixer, you'd be like,
3903940	3906940	Elvis Costello has a horrible infection.
3907940	3910940	And he needs, his sinuses need to be cleared out.
3912940	3914940	What's going on?
3915940	3916940	If it's happening.
3916940	3918940	You don't want to be going to charity
3918940	3920940	And put it there with another man
3920940	3923940	And put some furniture inside your room
3923940	3925940	And then put drapes in windows.
3927940	3928940	Come on, that guy's G.
3928940	3930940	He's just singing about anything.
3930940	3932940	I just proved it.
3932940	3934940	Did you say drapes in windows?
3935940	3936940	Yeah.
3936940	3938940	Ever heard of them?
3940940	3941940	No.
3941940	3943940	It's called Feng Shui, baby.
3943940	3946940	No, my assistant installed them, so I don't know what they are.
3947940	3950940	Do you ever say it's an end to me?
3952940	3955940	Sorry, Danielle, are you offended by any of this?
3956940	3958940	Let's hear your Elvis Costello impression.
3961940	3964940	Danielle, you came here from Liverpool.
3964940	3966940	You weathered the storm.
3966940	3968940	You weren't even going to come here tonight.
3968940	3971940	I want to make it worth your while.
3971940	3973940	Is there a problem we can help you with?
3973940	3975940	Do you have anything going on?
3975940	3976940	Do you want a husband?
3976940	3978940	Duncan will propose to you tonight.
3979940	3981940	Will you marry me, Danielle?
3982940	3983940	Don't.
3984940	3985940	Are you kidding me?
3985940	3986940	She made the right choice.
3986940	3989940	Maybe that's what she wants, is to reject someone tonight.
3989940	3991940	Maybe that's part of the thing.
3992940	3996940	There's no pain in your life that we can help alleviate.
3996940	3997940	You're having a good life.
3997940	3998940	I'm pretty good right now.
3998940	4000940	Well, you can afford to take this trip.
4000940	4003940	You didn't break the bank doing it, right?
4004940	4006940	It was quite expensive, but it was like...
4006940	4007940	How much was the plane ticket?
4007940	4010940	About four hundred odd pounds.
4011940	4012940	That's like three quid.
4012940	4015940	Joel McHale is going to reimburse you tonight.
4015940	4017940	And that's why we brought you on stage.
4017940	4018940	Joel McHale, everybody.
4018940	4020940	Give her a round of applause.
4024940	4027940	Oh, he's a guy who never came back.
4027940	4028940	I drove him.
4028940	4029940	Sorry.
4030940	4032940	He really left.
4033940	4034940	You left his phone.
4034940	4035940	No, he's actually...
4035940	4038940	No, he's actually going into a giant chest of gold
4038940	4040940	he carries around with him.
4040940	4041940	And he's kidding.
4041940	4043940	Oh my God, he's doing it.
4047940	4050940	How much cash do you carry with you?
4055940	4056940	Holy shit.
4057940	4058940	All right.
4058940	4059940	Well, we can't...
4059940	4060940	Yeah, let's fill it.
4060940	4061940	We've got to stretch, Duncan.
4061940	4062940	We've got to fill this time.
4062940	4064940	So, when I was on the airplane this morning...
4064940	4065940	All right, shut up, Spencer.
4065940	4066940	Joel's back.
4067940	4068940	Yes!
4070940	4072940	Oh, and he brought British money.
4073940	4074940	Oh, it's American.
4074940	4075940	Joel McHale!
4081940	4082940	That's cool.
4082940	4083940	Joel McHale just...
4083940	4091940	Just pressed a wad of good old green ass Kentucky-backed
4091940	4095940	Uncle Sam Skrilla into the...
4095940	4098940	I had to go in there to pull out of my butt.
4098940	4104940	Into the imperial palm of this royal layabout.
4104940	4105940	Yeah.
4105940	4108940	Because that's what the British need, more money.
4109940	4110940	That's America.
4110940	4111940	America give it...
4111940	4113940	You go back and you tell Elizabeth, we said,
4113940	4114940	What's up?
4114940	4115940	Yeah.
4120940	4123940	USA! USA! USA!
4123940	4127940	Could you believe the common name of all the 50 states
4127940	4132940	and all the bidders and the stripes and all the Marines
4132940	4136940	and all the drone strikes and Veronica?
4136940	4141940	Stop building it.
4143940	4146940	I thought you said Marines and garlic and...
4146940	4147940	I said, well, and ground strikes.
4147940	4150940	Marines and garlic and ground strikes.
4150940	4153940	Could you put Ben Farine in anti-vaccine
4153940	4154940	and the drone strikes?
4154940	4155940	I love it.
4157940	4158940	She's counting it.
4158940	4159940	She's counting it, yeah.
4160940	4161940	I get it.
4161940	4162940	She thumbed through it.
4162940	4164940	That's called the Glasgow thumb through.
4165940	4166940	How dare you?
4166940	4167940	She can count.
4167940	4168940	She can count something about the Scottish.
4168940	4169940	How dare you?
4170940	4171940	All right.
4171940	4172940	Well, unsolicited.
4172940	4175940	But now, definitely, a fantasy come true.
4175940	4177940	My God, tell us we're good people.
4177940	4178940	You don't have to. Sorry.
4179940	4180940	All right.
4180940	4183940	Well, the only thing left that could possibly make you feel better
4183940	4185940	is if you played Dungeons and Dragons with us, right?
4185940	4186940	Do you want to...
4186940	4187940	Yes!
4188940	4189940	Yeah.
4189940	4190940	Yeah.
4192940	4196940	I'm sure Joel will be a wonderful D&D player.
4198940	4200940	I cannot wait.
4202940	4203940	Is that...
4203940	4204940	Do we need more participation?
4204940	4206940	I played a lot of Top Secret growing up,
4206940	4208940	but not as much Dungeons and Dragons.
4208940	4210940	That's, you know, impressive in its own right.
4211940	4214940	I still have my original Top Secret box at home
4214940	4216940	with all my characters in it.
4217940	4218940	That's really cool.
4218940	4221940	It's like I'm really turned on right now.
4221940	4222940	Yeah.
4222940	4224940	Good thing you're sitting down, Spencer.
4224940	4225940	Yeah, yeah.
4225940	4228940	If you have as much hair in your head and face as you do around your dick,
4228940	4229940	it's going to be hard to see.
4229940	4231940	Well, there's more, my friends.
4231940	4232940	There's more where that came from.
4232940	4236940	Spencer's been looking at Shadowrun books lately.
4236940	4237940	Oh, yeah.
4237940	4240940	This guy from Austin, Piledriver, who's...
4240940	4241940	That's his nickname.
4241940	4243940	I can't remember his real name.
4243940	4246940	He gave me a Shadowrun book, and it's pretty great.
4246940	4247940	Hold on.
4247940	4250940	You know a guy named Piledriver?
4251940	4253940	He's from Texas, yeah.
4253940	4254940	Uh-huh.
4254940	4255940	Yeah.
4255940	4256940	Is he a wrestler? I pray?
4256940	4258940	No, he's a nerd.
4259940	4260940	Like, yeah.
4260940	4261940	He gave me his book.
4261940	4263940	He said he had an extra copy,
4263940	4266940	and that he's a lover of nerd culture,
4266940	4268940	and, you know, he wanted to spread the wealth.
4268940	4269940	Okay.
4269940	4271940	I'm a lover of nerd culture.
4271940	4272940	Hit it.
4272940	4274940	My name's Piledriver.
4275940	4277940	I want to treat you real nice.
4279940	4281940	Nerds deserve better.
4282940	4285940	You come in the back of my rig, I'll treat you real nice.
4286940	4287940	Nerd.
4287940	4289940	I don't... Thank you, Mr. Driver.
4289940	4290940	My name's Piledriver.
4291940	4294940	I feel like you're just saying that you love nerd culture.
4294940	4296940	I love nerds.
4296940	4298940	I want you to come in my truck. I love nerds.
4298940	4299940	You don't seem like a nerd.
4299940	4303940	You seem like a long-haul trucker who just wants to have sex with me.
4303940	4305940	You're not even wearing the nerd clothes.
4305940	4307940	I'm a nerd for Waylon Jennings.
4307940	4310940	I'm a nerd for highways.
4310940	4312940	I'm a nerd for fisting.
4314940	4317940	Why do you have a sidekick with you that is...
4317940	4320940	That there's my rig, my rig, my rig kicker.
4320940	4323940	I have to get back to the coffee shop that I work at, so...
4323940	4325940	Hey, I'm a nerd for coffee.
4325940	4328940	Give me some coffee. I'm a nerd.
4328940	4332940	I've got coffee that came out of a weasel's asshole.
4333940	4337940	My friend's a foodie. He's a foodie and a nerd.
4338940	4341940	My girlfriend from Liverpool and I just want to...
4341940	4343940	We don't want any troubles.
4343940	4345940	I'm an anglophile, too.
4347940	4349940	I love Monty Python. I love...
4349940	4351940	He loves angles.
4351940	4355940	He's the most agreeable predator I've ever met, so...
4356940	4359940	I'll show you a faulty tower. You won't forget.
4360940	4364940	Come on up back to my 18-wheeler.
4364940	4368940	I'm an anglophile, nerd, weasel, coffee butt.
4369940	4373940	I love Shadowrun and D&D.
4373940	4375940	D&D 10-4.
4375940	4380940	I will play Bonnie Vare as I straddle you.
4380940	4385940	Come on back. I got a sixth-level rogue with a Vorpal sword
4385940	4388940	with a bag of Holton and sad of his keister.
4389940	4393940	I feel like you've just memorized a lot of words
4393940	4396940	to lure me into your cab.
4396940	4400940	This is Grey Hawk coming down from the 10 to the 5.
4403940	4407940	I should... When I was playing D&D with my high school friends,
4407940	4409940	this guy, you know, like that movie The Fly,
4409940	4412940	this guy got trapped in a teleporter with a bag of Holting.
4412940	4414940	Which version of The Fly?
4414940	4416940	I don't know. I never saw it.
4417940	4421940	The one where they get fused, you know, fused together.
4421940	4423940	The fly and the person?
4423940	4426940	I'm sorry I derailed the story. I don't regret it.
4426940	4428940	It's important to clarify.
4428940	4429940	The Goldblum version, right?
4429940	4431940	Well, again, I never saw it.
4431940	4433940	I heard that in the audience.
4433940	4436940	So yeah, yeah, yeah. He fused with a bag of Holting
4436940	4442940	and then so he gained the ability to store up to 50 cubic feet in his asshole.
4443940	4448940	It was one of the most useful mutations he could have, man.
4449940	4451940	Agreed, Daniel?
4458940	4460940	A simple yes or no, Daniel.
4460940	4462940	Either it's useful to have...
4462940	4466940	To show hinges upon you agreeing or disagree.
4466940	4468940	To this.
4469940	4471940	Alright, she's just gonna...
4476940	4481940	Okay, someone just yelled out more radio CB signals to your...
4481940	4483940	He's got Tourette's, it's fine.
4483940	4485940	Alright, D&D, D&D?
4487940	4491940	Yep, see, I know stuff about people.
4491940	4493940	Do you want to pass these character sheets down?
4493940	4494940	Yeah, I do.
4494940	4496940	Just top to bottom, you know.
4497940	4499940	Top to bottom, 10 to 5, I got a...
4499940	4504940	Look, you keep saying things that nerds know, but it sounds like...
4504940	4511940	It's like that movie Mimic when the huge cockroaches look like they were homeless people on the subway.
4511940	4516940	And I'm gonna keep going with this analogy because it was...
4516940	4517940	Remember that movie?
4517940	4519940	What Oscar winner's movie?
4519940	4522940	Remember the movie Mimic when the guy kept going,
4522940	4523940	Missed!
4524940	4526940	I love that movie.
4527940	4529940	Are you talking about Armageddon?
4529940	4532940	That's a $50 bill from...
4532940	4537940	Joel, can you give Meltdown another $80 for their microphone?
4539940	4541940	Can we edit that out so that...
4541940	4544940	I think people are gonna love that while they're jogging.
4546940	4550940	People are gonna be driving to work and their car's gonna flip over.
4554940	4556940	All right.
4556940	4557940	Okay.
4557940	4558940	Here, Duncan.
4558940	4559940	You are Quark.
4559940	4562940	You're not Christa Burke, so you don't have to mutilate.
4562940	4563940	Great. Thank you.
4563940	4565940	It already has no dick.
4565940	4567940	I'm sorry I did that.
4567940	4568940	I really am.
4568940	4570940	I wish I'd never mutilated Camille's character.
4570940	4571940	We're all human, man.
4571940	4574940	You've never really played D&D before.
4574940	4575940	You don't know what's what.
4575940	4576940	It's all good.
4576940	4577940	Yeah, I should never have done that.
4577940	4578940	I'm sorry, Camille.
4578940	4581940	I should have never done a lot of things that I'd done.
4582940	4585940	In the movie Mimic, there's an old man.
4587940	4591940	There's these moth monsters that inhabit the subway and the...
4591940	4594940	They look like old men in trench coats.
4594940	4599940	And the only person that knows right away is the autistic child of a shoeshine guy.
4599940	4603940	And the autistic kid calls him Mr. Funny Shoes.
4603940	4605940	And so his father keeps going like,
4605940	4608940	Mr. Funny Shoes!
4608940	4610940	You gotta watch the movie Mimic.
4612940	4617940	And then the kids bring home a huge cockroach baby.
4617940	4620940	And the best part is that they store it in a Cheerios box,
4620940	4625940	which I'm sure I can't imagine the meeting they had with General Mills,
4625940	4629940	where they're like, they want to store the deadly baby...
4629940	4631940	Is that Mimic 1 or Mimic 2?
4631940	4632940	Mimic 1!
4632940	4633940	Mimic 2's a joke.
4637940	4639940	Mimic 1 is Mimic!
4640940	4641940	The only Mimic.
4641940	4643940	Those motherfuckers are Mimic purists!
4643940	4646940	Everyone knows that the best sequel is called Mimics.
4647940	4649940	Like aliens, come on.
4649940	4650940	Fuck.
4659940	4661940	I like Mimic.
4661940	4664940	Mr. Funny Shoes!
4665940	4668940	He like yells it out there, like the phrase Mr. Funny Shoes,
4668940	4671940	done in this horrible Italian accent, happens a lot in the movie.
4671940	4674940	Mr. Funny Shoes!
4675940	4677940	Mr. Funny Shoes.
4678940	4679940	Hey Spencer.
4679940	4680940	Hey.
4680940	4684940	I have a post-it from the Netflix original Arrested Development.
4684940	4685940	It's a classic.
4685940	4686940	It says,
4690940	4691940	Yeah.
4691940	4692940	Okay.
4693940	4696940	Well, you said, did you say you had a question?
4696940	4698940	No, I was letting you know that I have it,
4698940	4700940	because I'm going to kick your ass all over this thing.
4700940	4701940	I mean...
4701940	4702940	Yeah.
4702940	4703940	Oh, he knows how to play it.
4703940	4706940	No, is that, that was part of the character that I'm supposed to be in?
4706940	4707940	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4707940	4708940	You got a robot baby.
4708940	4709940	You have a robot baby.
4709940	4710940	All right, great.
4710940	4711940	All right.
4711940	4712940	You could kick anyone's ass with that, man.
4712940	4717940	So you in the live audience, like you, you, you're a couple episodes behind.
4717940	4718940	Several, maybe.
4718940	4720940	Because we haven't aired the podcast, but that's,
4720940	4725940	so you have to pay particular attention to Spencer's summary.
4725940	4726940	Yeah.
4726940	4729940	This is like watching Game of Thrones, four episodes ahead.
4729940	4730940	Yeah.
4730940	4734940	And you guys on stage, you, you, you, you, you, you,
4734940	4737940	you have to listen, really listen because...
4743940	4747940	So, Dusty, do you got any music or?
4747940	4748940	Dunkin's.
4748940	4749940	Oh, yeah.
4750940	4751940	Oh, yeah.
4751940	4752940	Oh, yeah.
4757940	4759940	Those are not the lyrics to them.
4766940	4767940	That's closer.
4768940	4771940	I started trying to do the German version.
4780940	4792940	Last time on Harmon Town, our heroes were deep underground on a sacred and secret passageway known as the Ghost Way.
4792940	4800940	After leaving Rose Book, our gang was headed to Fornheim, the frozen city, to confront Admiral Darkstar.
4800940	4802940	But they didn't know where to go.
4802940	4807940	So they hired a guide, one young boy named Lil Baskins.
4808940	4811940	Baskins was cheery, but wasn't as he seemed.
4811940	4816940	For the group quickly seemed to suss out his true nature that he was, in fact,
4816940	4821940	the ghost of a long dead child just trying to earn an honest dollar.
4821940	4825940	The gang embraced Baskins in love and acceptance, and the group was off.
4825940	4829940	Lil Baskins guided them into a secret and pitch black passageway,
4829940	4832940	warning them that the spirits don't appreciate the light,
4832940	4836940	and they attempted to blunder through the darkness blindly.
4836940	4839940	But after falling into and overcoming a pit trap,
4839940	4843940	Krista Berg realized that he had night vision goggles.
4843940	4846940	The trip was about to get a lot easier.
4846940	4847940	Or was it?
4847940	4850940	What mysteries lie ahead on the Ghost Way?
4850940	4852940	What spirits lurk in the dark depths?
4852940	4854940	And what of the robot baby?
4854940	4856940	Find out now.
4861940	4863940	That was so serene.
4863940	4867940	I want that CD for when I sleep tonight.
4867940	4869940	That was Kataro, I think.
4869940	4872940	I hope that's a local artist that we can all support,
4872940	4874940	like the end of a Felicity episode.
4874940	4882940	It's like, if you like tonight's D&D music, go to Jet Face.
4884940	4885940	Jet Face.
4885940	4889940	Jet Face is at LACMA this week, I think.
4889940	4891940	He has a live installation.
4891940	4895940	Jet Face picked a name ironic to his genre of music.
4895940	4897940	He's largely an ambient artist,
4897940	4901940	but he wanted to make a big impact on that scene.
4901940	4903940	A Jet Face.
4903940	4905940	Coming to the stage now is Jet Face.
4905940	4909940	Whoa.
4909940	4913940	You can see Jet Face's work at the new LA Natural History Museum
4913940	4915940	in the dinosaur exhibit.
4915940	4917940	Hit the music, hit the music, hit the music.
4917940	4920940	While you learn about glaciers, Jet Face will be playing.
4920940	4922940	It won't play the music while you're doing it.
4922940	4923940	Oh, no.
4923940	4924940	I mean, come on.
4924940	4925940	Jet Face.
4925940	4926940	Oh, he's got to queue it up.
4926940	4931940	The cassette has to be rewound.
4931940	4932940	Oh, shit.
4932940	4936940	But don't worry, it's not a metal tape, all right?
4936940	4941940	Jet Face is coming to your town.
4941940	4947940	I'm Jet Face's manager, Peter Dinklage.
4950940	4953940	Do you like in-your-face ambient sounds
4953940	4959940	that relax the fuck out of your entire nervous system?
4959940	4965940	Do you want to be swept in the fuck up in cosmic serenity?
4965940	4969940	Come to the 3rd Street Wilkinson Bridge.
4969940	4974940	We're going to show slides of glacial movement.
4974940	4980940	Blue whale's fucking with music by...
4980940	4988940	Jet, jet, jet, jet, jet, jet, jet, jet, jet, jet, Jet Face.
4988940	4992940	And that was just Jet Face's manager.
4992940	4995940	That was the pitch.
4995940	4996940	That was the pitch.
4996940	4998940	Yeah, if you hang out with the actual guy,
4998940	5001940	your hotel room's getting burnt.
5002940	5006940	His hotel rooms have concrete floors,
5006940	5012940	melting skull, oil paintings of Rockefeller.
5013940	5016940	Dan, I would see Jet Face in a second.
5016940	5020940	Jet Face!
5020940	5024940	See the Austin Bats fly out from under the bridge and Jet Face.
5024940	5027940	Don't you mean Houston Bats?
5027940	5030940	No!
5030940	5031940	You're right.
5031940	5032940	Too soon.
5032940	5033940	Too soon.
5033940	5034940	What were they booing?
5034940	5035940	I don't get it.
5035940	5036940	They don't know what's happening.
5036940	5040940	So usually everyone doesn't know what's happening.
5040940	5041940	Is that what's happening?
5041940	5043940	Yeah, that's usually the case.
5043940	5046940	You're in total complete darkness.
5046940	5048940	You can hear the echoes of your voices
5048940	5050940	and you find that from what you can hear
5050940	5053940	you must be in a huge underground cavern.
5053940	5055940	You've just passed the pit trap
5055940	5057940	and you're reconsolidating blindly
5057940	5060940	and ready to, or taking stock of your situation.
5060940	5061940	Who's Chris DeBerg here?
5061940	5062940	It's Joel.
5062940	5063940	It's Daniel.
5063940	5064940	Alright, Joel.
5064940	5067940	Okay, so you just, your character just put on
5067940	5069940	Dark Vision goggles, right?
5069940	5071940	Well, he didn't put them on yet.
5071940	5072940	Would you like to put them on?
5072940	5073940	I don't care.
5076940	5078940	Does it advance his podcast?
5078940	5079940	Yeah.
5079940	5081940	Of course I put on my Dark Vision goggles.
5081940	5082940	I would love to.
5082940	5084940	No, who's, yes, I cannot wait.
5084940	5086940	I put on the fucking goggles.
5087940	5088940	Putting on the goggles,
5088940	5090940	everything comes into sharp relief.
5090940	5092940	You're on a narrow pathway
5092940	5094940	that's no more than 10 feet wide
5094940	5096940	stretching on into darkness
5096940	5099940	flanked by bottomless pits on both sides.
5099940	5101940	You'll have to watch your step.
5101940	5103940	We watch our steps.
5104940	5106940	You watch your step.
5106940	5108940	But they can't because they're still blind.
5108940	5109940	Hey, what do you see?
5111940	5112940	What do I see?
5112940	5115940	You see a pathway flanked by bottomless pits.
5115940	5118940	I see a pathway with a bunch of bottomless pits
5118940	5121940	and there's a woman from Liverpool with us.
5122940	5124940	Alright, we'll watch our step.
5129940	5130940	You can't watch your step.
5130940	5131940	You're blind.
5131940	5132940	Well, I...
5134940	5135940	Why can't we do like that?
5135940	5138940	They do one of these where they go like this.
5139940	5140940	Yeah, I like that.
5140940	5142940	He's doing a prancing pony.
5142940	5143940	Like...
5147940	5149940	He's putting his foot in front of...
5149940	5150940	Yeah.
5150940	5152940	Like they're dipping it into water.
5152940	5155940	Like he's telling us because he can see.
5155940	5156940	He's like telling us,
5156940	5160940	okay, we're standing on a very narrow thing.
5160940	5161940	So yeah, we're...
5162940	5164940	Should we fire up like a...
5164940	5166940	Oh, I shoot an arrow at something.
5166940	5168940	I shoot an arrow into the darkness.
5168940	5170940	I'm just gonna cast Mage Light.
5170940	5171940	You miss.
5171940	5172940	Okay.
5172940	5173940	You cast...
5173940	5174940	You can roll a die.
5174940	5175940	How do you know?
5175940	5176940	What?
5176940	5177940	Because you didn't hit any...
5177940	5178940	Or you didn't aim at anything.
5178940	5179940	Alright, sorry.
5179940	5180940	Can I...
5180940	5181940	Little...
5181940	5182940	Little Baskins.
5182940	5183940	Oh, hey.
5183940	5184940	I'm about to cast Mage Light.
5184940	5185940	Is that cool?
5185940	5186940	No, I told you.
5186940	5187940	Total darkness.
5187940	5188940	The spirits don't appreciate lights.
5188940	5189940	Okay.
5189940	5190940	Alright.
5190940	5191940	Okay, okay, okay.
5191940	5192940	So why don't we do like the Hokey Pokey
5192940	5194940	where you put your hands on each other's shoulders
5194940	5196940	and he weeds us.
5196940	5197940	Yeah, it's like a wedding.
5197940	5198940	It's like a wedding.
5198940	5199940	It's like a party.
5199940	5200940	It's like a party.
5200940	5201940	It's a party.
5201940	5202940	It's a party.
5202940	5203940	It's a party.
5203940	5204940	It's a party.
5204940	5205940	I'm a party.
5205940	5206940	And it's fun.
5206940	5207940	The Hokey Pokey.
5207940	5208940	I'm a party.
5208940	5209940	It's a party.
5209940	5210940	It's a party.
5210940	5211940	A party.
5211940	5212940	A party.
5212940	5213940	The Hokey Pokey.
5213940	5214940	The Hokey Pokey.
5214940	5215940	Yeah, where...
5215940	5216940	Conga line, you fucking idiot.
5216940	5217940	That was good.
5217940	5218940	That was good.
5218940	5219940	Where did you get that shirt in?
5219940	5220940	Fuck off.
5220940	5221940	I called the Hokey Pokey when I'm in a cave.
5221940	5222940	Let's get through this dark cave, assholes.
5222940	5223940	An eye drop.
5223940	5224940	It's battle over this nice foreign lady.
5224940	5225940	She's from Liverpool.
5225940	5226940	Yeah.
5226940	5227940	That's called Tuesday.
5228940	5229940	Spencer, we're doing a conga line.
5229940	5230940	Someone's battling me today.
5230940	5231940	Yeah.
5231940	5232940	In conga line formation.
5232940	5236860	Why didn't we go in this cave?
5236860	5242040	You find it really easy to make your way through the passageway.
5242040	5243940	It turns out that that's all it took.
5243940	5244940	Great.
5244940	5248980	You spent 10 minutes on this.
5248980	5250380	Thank you.
5250380	5255980	So you get to the end of the passageway and you can feel the wind coming in from the other
5255980	5258220	side of a portcullis.
5258220	5263220	That's a locked gate with mechanical armaments that make it work.
5263220	5265540	A portcullis is a locked gate?
5265540	5267220	It's like a locked gate with gears and shit.
5267220	5268220	Why don't you just say locked gate?
5268220	5272100	Because a portcullis has gears and shit and gates don't typically have gears, I don't
5272100	5273100	think.
5273100	5274100	You're right.
5274100	5275100	I stand very correct.
5275100	5276100	Why are you trying to...
5276100	5277100	He's the dungeon master.
5277100	5278660	I'm a dungeon master, man.
5278660	5279660	What?
5279660	5284260	I'm a dungeon master.
5284260	5289220	He's Joel played football in the real school.
5289220	5292580	Dungeons and Dragons.
5292580	5294540	He's kicking sand on the umpire.
5294540	5295540	That's what he's doing.
5295540	5296540	They have umpires in football.
5296540	5297540	There's a lot of umpires in football.
5297540	5298540	That was the perfect touch shot.
5298540	5299540	What are you talking about?
5299540	5300540	What are you talking about?
5300540	5301540	Strike three.
5301540	5302540	Two-yard penalty.
5302540	5303540	All right.
5303540	5304540	So go ahead.
5304540	5305540	Yeah.
5305540	5306540	All right.
5306540	5307540	You find yourself at this portcullis.
5307540	5319080	The wind blowing in your face indicates that you must be near the surface as fresh air
5319080	5320780	is flowing.
5320780	5324380	If you could get past this portcullis, you might be out of here.
5324380	5329420	Little Baskins is like, I don't know how to, you know, I just usually phase through walls,
5329420	5331460	so I don't know how to help you guys out.
5331460	5333020	The robot baby said that?
5333020	5334020	A little Baskins.
5334020	5335700	He's a ghost boy.
5335700	5337780	We have a robot baby and a ghost boy.
5337780	5341020	I can understand your confusion.
5341020	5343460	We asked the robot baby, what should we do?
5343460	5346140	We're at this complicated gate.
5346140	5348340	We should try and unlock it, I think.
5348340	5349340	Unlock your robot baby.
5349340	5350340	Wait.
5350340	5351340	Hold on.
5351340	5352340	Hold on.
5352340	5353340	We should try to lock it, I think.
5353340	5354340	Sorry.
5354340	5355340	Sorry, everybody.
5355340	5356340	That makes sense now.
5356340	5357340	That's how robots talk.
5357340	5358340	That's how robot babies talk.
5358340	5359340	Yeah.
5359340	5361940	That's one of two voices I do.
5361940	5362940	All right, robot baby.
5362940	5364540	Well, do you think you can unlock it?
5364540	5373660	I can do it as sure as I like getting kicked.
5373660	5374660	You like getting kicked, robot baby?
5374660	5375660	You like getting kicked, robot baby?
5375660	5378260	I love it.
5378260	5381900	I kicked the robot baby.
5381900	5384100	He likes it.
5384100	5389100	You knock him into the portcullis and he hits it with a sharp clang before bouncing off.
5389100	5392260	He said he can like getting kicked.
5392260	5393260	He what?
5393260	5394900	He said he can like getting kicked.
5394900	5395900	I sure can.
5395900	5400780	He could also like not getting kicked, right, robot baby?
5400780	5401780	I sure can.
5401780	5404780	He doesn't feel pain, clearly.
5404780	5410860	I love that you immediately kicked him.
5410860	5414780	He said he likes getting, I misunderstood, I thought he said he likes getting kicked.
5414780	5416620	He said he can like getting kicked.
5416620	5419580	I can like it.
5419580	5422900	Did him kicking robot baby into the gate unlock it?
5422900	5425420	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5425420	5427420	We all contain multitudes.
5427420	5433460	All right, well, Krista Berg, you're a, Krista Berg's a thief, right?
5433460	5434460	He sure is.
5434460	5435460	Krista Berg, Daniel.
5435460	5436460	I'm Krista Berg.
5436460	5437460	Oh, you're Daniel.
5437460	5438460	Okay.
5438460	5439460	Who's Daniel?
5439460	5440460	Oh, Daniel Nitty.
5440460	5441460	Okay.
5441460	5442460	Do you want to be Krista Berg?
5442460	5443460	No, no, no, no, no.
5443460	5444460	No.
5444460	5445460	I mean, it's not a big deal.
5445460	5446460	Joel, Krista Berg, you're a thief.
5446460	5447460	You could unlock the gate.
5447460	5448460	I will steal the gate.
5448460	5449460	Yes.
5450460	5456980	I put it in my room, my cape, my hooded cape.
5456980	5462340	Oh, I will use whatever you would recommend to unlock this gate.
5462340	5463340	Well, I'd ask Dan.
5463340	5464660	I'd let the chef choose.
5464660	5465860	That'd be cheating.
5465860	5466860	You got to ask Dan.
5466860	5468100	Dan probably can help you out with that.
5468100	5470660	Oh, well, you should probably have some thief tools in here.
5470660	5471660	It's true.
5471660	5472660	Inventory.
5472660	5473660	Would that be in my gear?
5473660	5474660	Yeah.
5474660	5475660	Yeah.
5475660	5476660	I promise you have thief tools.
5476660	5482580	I'm going to use boring podcast to get through that.
5482580	5485940	I'm sitting here reading in front of you.
5485940	5488500	I'm quietly reading my gear.
5488500	5489500	And not just...
5489500	5490500	And you're like, how dare you?
5490500	5491500	We can't...
5491500	5492500	The tension is huge.
5492500	5493500	All right.
5493500	5500980	I'm going to say a number of things and you tell me if I can use them, team.
5500980	5502980	All right.
5502980	5503980	Thieves tools.
5503980	5504980	Yeah.
5504980	5505980	Yes.
5506780	5507780	Great.
5507780	5511260	Well, I'm so sorry I lashed out the way I did.
5511260	5512420	It's all right.
5512420	5513420	It's all right.
5513420	5516580	The world is changing, man.
5516580	5519140	I do have some acid if you need that later.
5519140	5520140	And one Bola.
5520140	5522220	I don't know what that is.
5522220	5523220	That's a...
5523220	5524820	Should I use a smoke bomb?
5524820	5525820	You could.
5525820	5526820	I mean...
5526820	5529220	Now, I'm going to use the thieves tools on the road, the gate.
5529220	5530220	On the...
5530220	5532220	What do you call it?
5532220	5533620	Shut up.
5533620	5535460	I don't care.
5535460	5540220	Using your thieves tools, you completely dismantle the port colas and can easily detach
5540220	5542020	it and take it wherever you'd like.
5542020	5543020	Wow.
5543020	5544020	Yes.
5544020	5545020	You're welcome, assholes.
5545020	5546020	Yeah.
5546020	5547020	Thank you.
5547020	5548020	I'm up.
5548020	5549020	See?
5549020	5550020	Oh.
5550020	5551020	See?
5551020	5552020	You played Dungeons and Dragons.
5552020	5553020	It's just like on that TV show.
5553020	5554020	It was pretty...
5554020	5555020	Yeah.
5555020	5557340	It was like the cartoon when I was a kid.
5557340	5559740	And that movie with one of the Wayans brothers.
5559740	5561220	Oh my God.
5561220	5563140	That movie was so good.
5563140	5564140	Awesome.
5564140	5565140	Yeah.
5565500	5566500	It's...
5566500	5568500	Jeremy Irons was amazing in that movie.
5568500	5569500	He's so good.
5569500	5570500	Oh my God.
5570500	5574180	Dan, have you ever had the Dungeon Master flip out like this?
5574180	5576100	I don't think so.
5576100	5578900	I never talked to him about the shitty Dungeons and Dragons movie.
5578900	5580580	It's so bad.
5580580	5585300	It starts with like, he murders a dragon and then CG blood, which is doing the same thing
5585300	5589740	that normal water, I don't know, colored red would do downstairs.
5589740	5594580	But it's terrible CG and you're like, this is going to be good.
5594580	5598340	And it doesn't disappoint in that it completely disappoints.
5598340	5604300	I just remember like one like monster guy in the city going like, if you want, I will
5604300	5607020	cut out your heart.
5607020	5612060	Like he does like this really weird performance thing and yeah, that was it.
5612060	5618460	And I was like, my face turned bright red and I like, I just looked down at something
5618460	5619780	for the rest of the movie.
5619780	5620780	Yeah.
5620780	5621780	That sounds about right.
5621780	5622780	There's this guy with blue lips.
5622780	5623780	Alright.
5623780	5624780	Yeah.
5624780	5625780	That was the guy.
5625780	5626780	He looked like a frangy kind of.
5626780	5627780	And they never explained that choice.
5627780	5629900	And it doesn't matter at all that he looked like that.
5629900	5630900	Oh my God.
5630900	5631900	I bet.
5631900	5632900	I bet.
5632900	5633900	I bet.
5633900	5634900	The grips were high fiving that guy.
5634900	5635900	Awesome acting choice.
5635900	5636900	Yeah.
5636900	5637900	That was amazing.
5637900	5643300	Where at the end of your line, you went, that wasn't weird at all.
5643300	5644900	That was actual acting.
5644900	5645900	You did great.
5645900	5646900	I'd love it.
5646900	5647900	Shut up, Danielle.
5647900	5648900	Let us play.
5649620	5650620	How did this get made?
5650620	5652980	Should do the Dungeons and Dragons movie.
5652980	5653980	Yeah.
5653980	5662060	Tell them that portcullis threshold transgressors, you walk into a natural stone cave with its
5662060	5664180	dimly lit from the outside light.
5664180	5667820	Lil Baskins is like, you know, when we get out, it's going to wait.
5667820	5668820	That's not his voice.
5668820	5669820	Sorry.
5669820	5670820	Lil Baskins.
5670820	5674820	Like when we get out, it's going to be real cold and you know, unless you have some serious
5674820	5678260	parkas, we're going to need to gear up or you're freeze to death.
5678260	5679260	Okay.
5679260	5681540	So just, you know, keep that in mind.
5681540	5683000	I put on a coat.
5683000	5684460	You don't have a coat.
5684460	5685740	I put on the gate.
5685740	5689460	I just dismantle.
5689460	5690860	I light my flaming sword.
5690860	5692420	I have a flaming sword.
5692420	5693420	You do that.
5693420	5698380	So I light it or whatever you do, I click it to get it going and I would like to say
5698380	5699880	thank you for that.
5699880	5700880	Thank you.
5700880	5701880	So we have warmth now.
5701880	5702880	So it works, right?
5702880	5703880	Yeah.
5703880	5704880	You guys have warmth currently.
5704880	5707060	Don't I still have a thing of resisting elements of something?
5707060	5712900	I think there's the resistance cloak, but, uh, yeah, I mean, if Lil Baskins is like that
5712900	5718460	cloak's not going to work, what winter's coming.
5718460	5720500	I put on the amulet of autumn.
5720500	5730420	So it's not that cold yet, but then I was like burning leaves.
5730420	5731420	That's the season.
5731420	5736500	It currently is smells like pumpkin spice or your little Baskins.
5736500	5741300	It's going to get so cold out there that resist elements doesn't work.
5741300	5742860	Well, resist elements is a spell.
5742860	5744620	I'm talking about your cloak of resistance.
5744620	5745620	He got there.
5745620	5746620	It's pretty shabby.
5746620	5750500	If you ask me, motherfucker, what do you recommend?
5750500	5753780	Lil Baskins, some warm animal hides.
5753780	5754780	We got to go hunt.
5754780	5758700	What do you, whatever you want, did we just spin off into a different like series?
5758700	5761660	Like it's just going to be about us hunting and carrying leather.
5761660	5763540	Hey, do you want to freeze to death?
5763540	5768260	Because it could be about that instead.
5768260	5771980	I killed Danielle's character and hide inside of her body.
5771980	5774580	She's a tauntaun, right?
5774580	5775580	It's like that.
5775580	5776580	All right.
5776580	5777580	I don't, I retract that.
5777580	5778580	All right.
5778580	5779580	All right, guys.
5779580	5782860	Well, I guess we have to go hunting for indigenous species.
5782860	5785940	This is so exciting.
5785940	5788580	Let's go looking for stuff.
5788580	5800140	So as you're exiting the cave, you hear the sound of some sort of snoring beast.
5800140	5809260	I hope it has fur.
5809260	5813660	Proceeding ahead, you can see two sleeping rhinocerae.
5813660	5815300	Holy shit.
5815300	5818820	Those motherfuckers are covered in leather.
5818820	5819820	But not fur.
5819820	5820820	Yeah.
5820820	5821820	Yeah.
5821820	5822820	But leather.
5822820	5824820	We could have a leather party if we kill these things.
5824820	5825820	This would be great.
5825820	5826820	Okay, guys.
5826820	5827820	There's a rhinocerae up there.
5827820	5837620	I say we sneak up on them and kill them.
5837620	5838620	What do you think?
5838620	5841620	What's your character's name?
5841620	5842620	Dignity Sarsguard.
5842620	5843620	What do you think?
5843620	5844620	You want to do that?
5844620	5845620	Okay.
5845620	5848900	Well, what if we could tame them and ride them?
5848900	5849900	Stop talking so loud.
5849900	5853740	What if we tame these rhinos?
5853740	5854740	What would taming them?
5854740	5855740	We're not going to kill rhinocerae.
5855740	5857340	We don't have time to tame the rhinocerae.
5857340	5862900	Wait, I kind of want to hear just out of morbid curiosity.
5862900	5866220	Where do you see taming them going?
5866220	5871980	Because then when we're in the cold, they can pee on us to keep us warm.
5871980	5877300	Not only will we be warm, but we get to get really aroused by water sports, dude.
5877300	5883420	Do you understand that the only reason pee is warm is because it's inside a rhino?
5883420	5884420	There's a lot of pee.
5884420	5885420	As soon as it comes out, it starts...
5885420	5886420	There's a lot of pee in a rhino, friend.
5886420	5892260	Yeah, but dude, the moment the pee hits the outside, then we'll be cold from being wet.
5892260	5898260	Not everybody's a scientist.
5898260	5906020	Why did you bring this dick with us?
5906020	5907660	It wasn't for moments like this.
5907660	5908660	I just...
5908660	5912460	Let's kill these fuckers, go ambush the rhinos.
5912460	5920620	We could at least use their meat to lure furrier animals.
5920620	5923140	We have a plan.
5923140	5927300	Yuh-hey!
5927300	5930660	I'm going to throw some blinding powder at them.
5930660	5931660	Blinding powder?
5931660	5932660	Powders!
5932660	5933660	Powders!
5933660	5940060	Are anyone else going to do anything right at this turn before the rhinoceroses?
5940060	5942340	What is God's bread?
5942340	5945780	God's bread is a plant?
5945780	5948140	Are you asking me?
5948140	5950300	It's a magical plant.
5950300	5953780	It's not going to kill rhinoceroses, you can eat a couple leaves of it.
5953780	5958660	It's like eating an entire loaf of bread, which is really my nightmare.
5958660	5967740	I'm using my, I'd like to use my amulet of spring to ensnare the rhinos with 20 feet
5967740	5971140	of vines.
5971140	5976420	And I use my amulet of winter to call a sleet storm on top of the rhinos.
5976420	5979260	Well now we're going to be really cold, asshole.
5979260	5982500	Well it's on the rhinos, it's not us.
5982500	5986500	Your sleet storm is that discerning and specific?
5986500	5988260	Yes!
5988260	5991980	It's like rain in Miami.
5991980	5994660	Alright what about dignity, you want to do anything?
5994660	5996660	Somebody stab these things!
5996660	6001820	I can throw my throwing ox on it.
6001820	6005420	Doing those things!
6005420	6012660	Christa Berg throws his blinding powder into the midst of the rhinos as dignity looses
6012660	6015100	her axe.
6015100	6025420	It strikes one of them right in the shoulder above it's front leg dealing five damage.
6025420	6026420	Nice job!
6026420	6032900	While Christa Berg summons a sleet storm, sending, driving sleet and icing, it's cold
6032900	6033900	water.
6033900	6034900	Quark did it, not Christa Berg.
6034900	6037660	What a weird day for these rhinoceros.
6037660	6045900	I'm blind, what happened, it's cold, it's snowing into the cave.
6045900	6047180	What did Dan do?
6047180	6052340	I used my amulet of spring to ensnare them so that they're a captive audience for these
6052340	6056500	rather nefarious activities.
6056500	6063060	While you launch vines towards the rhinocerae, casting your magical amulet takes a bit longer
6063060	6066940	than throwing an axe.
6066940	6073220	The rhinocerae is hit by the axe, bolts upright and charges out of the cave.
6073220	6077060	But the other one is entangled fast and blinded.
6077060	6080820	It's struggling wildly like a mad animal.
6080820	6084980	I have something called a dragon dick.
6084980	6086980	That's gotta do something great.
6086980	6091260	It can fuck a dragon.
6091260	6095060	Can I fuck this charging rhino like a dragon?
6095060	6097980	The charging rhino has left the cave.
6097980	6100140	You can fuck the...
6100140	6101140	I don't like the idea.
6101140	6102140	Fuck the blind rhino!
6102140	6104020	It doesn't sound good.
6104020	6106020	Do it!
6106020	6107420	Fuck the blind rhino!
6107420	6111660	I used my dragon dick on the blind rhino.
6111660	6113660	Yes!
6113660	6116740	Untweetable.
6116740	6120620	It's way too big, you couldn't even get it into anything.
6120780	6121780	The lions are giant.
6121780	6122780	They're fucking big.
6122780	6123780	Right.
6123780	6124780	How does he...
6124780	6125780	Mission accomplished.
6125780	6128780	Sorry guys, my dick's too big.
6128780	6129780	Nice.
6129780	6130780	Nice.
6130780	6134780	Too big to fuck a rhino.
6134780	6137340	Someone has a sword to stab.
6137340	6141500	All of you have swords, I think.
6141500	6146220	Oh yeah, I hit it with my flaming sword.
6146220	6147500	Barbecue dude.
6147500	6150940	You do that, and it deals some amount of damage.
6150940	6153100	Well, that's pretty obvious, right?
6153100	6156380	Yeah, I think so, especially when you hit him.
6156380	6161100	Ten damage, and it catches fire.
6161100	6162460	Rhino meat for everybody.
6162460	6167180	However, the fire, it burns out the vines, and it becomes un-entangled.
6167180	6168180	Oh shit!
6168180	6169180	Sorry.
6169180	6171860	It's cool.
6171860	6175500	It struggles to its feet and starts crashing into the cavern walls.
6175500	6181100	It starts sending rocks and sand and dirt coming down from the ceiling above.
6181100	6186300	It's getting kind of dangerous, but you aren't attacked by it because it's blind.
6186300	6188860	It's all to keep warm.
6188860	6191260	It's all because you decided to do stuff to rhinos.
6191260	6192260	I mean...
6192260	6197900	We could have walked past them and hoped to come to a coke factory.
6197900	6200140	Or you could have crept up on them and slit their throats.
6200140	6201140	I mean, there's a lot of options.
6201140	6206020	And fog factory, right over on the other side of the rhinos.
6206020	6210020	Okay, dude.
6210020	6217100	I think that Moraine is the only person that could cast resist elements, and she's dead.
6217100	6218100	What do you guys want to do?
6218100	6219100	Should we kill this rhino?
6219100	6220100	Dead.
6220100	6221100	I think we have to.
6221100	6222100	What?
6222100	6223100	Turrets.
6223100	6224100	Uh, I...
6224100	6225100	Okay, I'm gonna...
6225100	6232140	Who's up next?
6232140	6233140	Whoever goes first.
6233140	6234540	I have chains.
6234540	6235540	I use the...
6235540	6242060	I throw my chains around the rhino's legs to try to snare it.
6242060	6243060	All right.
6243060	6246740	The rampaging rhino is too wild to get your chains in it.
6246740	6247740	Sorry.
6247740	6250140	I'm shocking grasp.
6250140	6251980	I hear the kids.
6251980	6253260	I'm a slave to the streets.
6253260	6255620	I will give them what they want.
6255620	6256820	It's part of the urban culture.
6256820	6262460	I will do shocking grasp on the rhino.
6262460	6268860	Striking the rhino with a lightning infused, uh, grasp, grasping motion.
6268860	6269860	What are you doing to it?
6269860	6270860	I'm miming it.
6270860	6271860	It looks like you're having sex with it.
6271860	6273980	I'm miming shock in the rhino.
6273980	6276740	Yeah.
6276740	6279660	It takes 25 lightning dunes.
6279660	6281140	Yeah!
6282140	6283660	We're saved!
6283660	6285140	We are saved.
6285140	6287260	And it falls to the ground stunned.
6287260	6288380	It's not dead, but it's definitely...
6288380	6290460	I walk up and stab it in the throat.
6290460	6291460	Wait.
6291460	6292460	Can I talk to it?
6292460	6293460	I'm gonna talk to it.
6293460	6294460	Don't talk to the rhino.
6294460	6295460	Well, which do you do first?
6295460	6296460	I speak rhino to it.
6296460	6297460	No, you don't speak rhino.
6297460	6298460	Oh.
6298460	6299460	Uh...
6299460	6300460	Yeah, you don't.
6300460	6301460	Sorry.
6301460	6302460	I had to make sure.
6302460	6303460	Uh, first thought, best thought.
6303460	6304460	Stab it in the throat.
6304460	6310860	I stab it in the throat, uh, and I, uh, yeah, and then I try to saw its head off.
6311580	6313580	And then I want to wear the head.
6315580	6316580	Wait, wait.
6316580	6318940	I stop him.
6318940	6321700	Let it piss on us first.
6321700	6322700	It's not...
6322700	6323700	He didn't say it was pissing.
6323700	6325700	We're not gonna wait around for that.
6325700	6326700	Alright.
6326700	6327700	We are...
6327700	6328700	Dude, we are freezing.
6328700	6329700	I'm fine in this cave.
6329700	6331900	You already unleashed a cold storm onto the thing.
6331900	6332900	We're freezing.
6332900	6333900	Fine.
6333900	6334900	It's true.
6334900	6336300	You guys are pretty chilly.
6336300	6341580	But you find it rather easy to stab the stunned beast in the throat and saw off its head and
6341580	6343540	wear it on your head.
6343540	6344540	Yay!
6344540	6348420	It's a look that you definitely can pull off.
6348420	6350900	And now I'm gonna sing something by Black Sabbath.
6350900	6351900	I'm not sure what.
6351900	6352900	Yeah.
6352900	6353900	Just about?
6353900	6354900	No.
6354900	6355900	A Black Sabbath song.
6355900	6356900	Come on.
6356900	6359900	Black Sabbath is the best band ever!
6359900	6362140	No, it's been a hard year for Black Sabbath.
6362140	6365900	As if I were Elvis Costello, I'm gonna sing about Black Sabbath.
6366900	6367900	Dead Rhino.
6367900	6368900	Alright.
6368900	6370900	We got one dead rhino.
6370900	6371900	You know what they say?
6371900	6372900	Yep.
6372900	6376900	One dead rhino is better than two.
6376900	6377900	Albino.
6377900	6378900	Zero dead rhino.
6378900	6380900	I have a skinning knife.
6380900	6381900	You sure do.
6381900	6383900	I start skinning this rhino.
6383900	6384900	Alright.
6384900	6385900	You skin it.
6385900	6386900	Yeah.
6386900	6387900	That's easy enough.
6387900	6388900	You skin it.
6388900	6391900	I'll go get the other rhino, guys.
6391900	6393900	And I trot off.
6394900	6398900	And I trot off like a breathless Hilary Swank in an action film.
6398900	6399900	Let's just...
6399900	6402900	Somebody wear the rhino and let's get on with this thing.
6402900	6404900	We've got to move on with the...
6404900	6406900	What is our point of all of this?
6406900	6407900	What's the point?
6407900	6408900	Where are we going?
6408900	6409900	Fornheim.
6409900	6410900	The frozen city.
6410900	6412900	We're gonna freeze to death is the thing.
6412900	6413900	We got rhinos.
6413900	6414900	We killed...
6414900	6416900	They're not gonna make us warmer, I guess.
6416900	6420900	Do you think we could make warmth out of rhinos?
6420900	6421900	Yeah.
6421900	6422900	It'll help a little bit.
6422900	6424900	Maybe stuff some hay in there.
6424900	6426900	Oh, is there hay around?
6426900	6428900	Not in the cave, but maybe somewhere.
6428900	6429900	Or dried leaves.
6429900	6430900	I don't know.
6430900	6431900	I don't know.
6431900	6432900	Cardboard, newspapers...
6432900	6434900	I run off where the other rhino run.
6434900	6436900	Newspapers and cardboard in D&D?
6436900	6437900	No, sorry.
6437900	6439900	I was being a word.
6439900	6441900	I'm in pursuit of the other rhino.
6441900	6443900	Yeah, you are.
6443900	6448900	You step out of the cave into a similar graveyard in the forest.
6448900	6452900	It's a nice little graveyard with probably less than 30 graves in it.
6452900	6455900	You can see that several of the graves are just devastated,
6455900	6458900	and a large portion of the fence has been dismantled
6458900	6461900	as if a rhino had charged through it.
6461900	6466900	Are there corpses or bodies in the devastated graves?
6466900	6469900	Uh... probably.
6469900	6470900	I mean...
6470900	6471900	Are they wearing clothes?
6471900	6472900	Do they have...
6472900	6474900	Maybe we could wear the corpse clothes to keep warm.
6474900	6475900	Little bastards?
6475900	6477900	I don't want to smell that bad.
6477900	6479900	Little baskets!
6479900	6480900	Hey, guys.
6480900	6481900	I'm Little Baskins.
6481900	6482900	You're dead.
6482900	6484900	What do you make of this cemetery?
6484900	6485900	It's...
6485900	6486900	It's right...
6486900	6488900	I feel right at home.
6488900	6493900	Are you going to be offended if we desecrate these graves and look for fur coats?
6493900	6496900	Well, it looks like those guys are right ahead of you.
6496900	6500900	In the corner of the graveyard, you see two dark figures that are hunched over.
6500900	6501900	They look like they're digging.
6501900	6502900	Digging for something.
6502900	6503900	Brave robbers.
6504900	6507900	You didn't see them before because of rhino devastation.
6507900	6509900	The two forms stand up.
6509900	6511900	They reveal themselves to be gnolls, and they're like,
6511900	6512900	Oh, shit.
6512900	6515900	You are here fast.
6515900	6518900	We... fuck.
6518900	6523900	You what?
6523900	6524900	You?
6524900	6526900	Identify yourselves.
6526900	6528900	You... you bastards.
6528900	6531900	I will not do that.
6531900	6535900	Don't you remember when you killed our brother,
6535900	6539900	our brother Yurch, in cold blood?
6539900	6541900	And we swore vengeance.
6541900	6544900	This is that bitch.
6544900	6545900	This is your vengeance?
6545900	6546900	Oh, yeah.
6546900	6549900	Running into you in a cold cemetery?
6549900	6551900	Yeah, we're a bit late for our vengeance.
6551900	6555900	Dan, remember that time we got vengeance on that one guy
6555900	6559900	by digging and hoping he would come near us?
6559900	6560900	My friend has a point.
6560900	6564900	Your vengeance is lame.
6564900	6565900	Why are we...
6565900	6566900	How are we seeking vengeance?
6566900	6567900	Just keep digging.
6567900	6568900	He's going to show up.
6568900	6570900	Let's go to a remote location and dig,
6570900	6573900	and then the vengeance will come up out of a box.
6573900	6575900	If it doesn't work, we're going to lay a sprinkler pipe in here.
6575900	6576900	Yeah, spring lane.
6576900	6577900	Where's vengeance ever?
6577900	6580900	The smaller of the two gnolls spreads his arm out,
6580900	6584900	and you see black lightning bolts surge into the earth below,
6584900	6587900	and then you hear a rumbling, almost as if the ground is moving,
6587900	6590900	and several bony arms burst out of the soil
6590900	6593900	and start to pull themselves out to their feet.
6593900	6594900	Oops.
6594900	6595900	I pull out my...
6595900	6596900	I have a whole...
6596900	6597900	I pull out my holy symbol.
6597900	6598900	I have a holy symbol.
6598900	6599900	Oh, shit.
6599900	6602900	You didn't talk about your dick, bro.
6602900	6604900	I pull out my cock.
6604900	6605900	You have no cock.
6605900	6606900	You don't have one.
6606900	6608900	No, I'm not Chris DeBurg in this one.
6608900	6609900	No.
6609900	6610900	It's not his.
6610900	6613900	Cork doesn't have a dick anymore either.
6614900	6618900	So two people in this group don't have cocks.
6618900	6619900	He has someone else's cock.
6619900	6620900	He pulls it out.
6620900	6621900	Holy shit.
6621900	6624900	Yeah, there's one cock left in the party.
6626900	6629900	Because Chris DeBurg cut his own penis off in an earlier episode.
6629900	6631900	Yeah, it was awesome when I did that.
6631900	6633900	It was necessary, and I'm fine.
6633900	6634900	It's going to grow back.
6634900	6636900	I'm a fucking salamander, all right?
6638900	6639900	It takes a while.
6639900	6642900	Can we kill these dead people, please?
6642900	6643900	Do something.
6643900	6645900	You from Liverpool?
6648900	6649900	All right.
6649900	6651900	She mumbles nothing.
6652900	6654900	She makes a high-pitched mumble.
6654900	6655900	Does that work?
6655900	6656900	It's super effective.
6657900	6658900	No, no.
6658900	6659900	I'm sorry.
6659900	6660900	That doesn't work.
6660900	6662900	I look at these gnolls and I say,
6662900	6664900	y'all using blood magic?
6665900	6666900	Not yet, bitch.
6666900	6668900	But I'm about to.
6668900	6671900	He slashes his thumb open and smears it across the scroll
6671900	6674900	and holds it above his head, and you see a swirling torrent
6674900	6677900	of blood come out of the scroll and surround these skeletal
6677900	6681900	zombies and engulfing their forms in sticky, coagulated blood.
6681900	6682900	Oh, all right.
6682900	6683900	Anything else?
6684900	6685900	He pulls out a shotgun.
6685900	6686900	Okay.
6687900	6688900	Cool.
6688900	6689900	I just want to know.
6689900	6690900	Thank you.
6690900	6691900	All right, we should stop there.
6691900	6693900	We got a big fight coming up with some skeletons.
6693900	6695900	We're going to stop Dungeons and Dragons there.
6695900	6697900	That's the end of the show.
6697900	6698900	Wait, wait, hold on.
6698900	6699900	Wait, wait, wait.
6699900	6707900	All we did was kill one of two rhinos for no reason.
6707900	6709900	And we were cold.
6709900	6712900	We accomplished more in this session than we've ever accomplished
6712900	6713900	in D&D ever.
6716900	6718900	Let's thank Joel McHale for coming by.
6720900	6724900	Guest Comptroller Duncan Trussell, Danielle from Liverpool.
6726900	6727900	As always,
6730900	6732900	the Nerdmelt Theatre, Justin Marshall back there,
6732900	6734900	and Zach working audio.
6734900	6736900	Spencer Crittenden, the Dungeon Master.
6739900	6742900	Maybe go figure out a way to download the Yahoo screen app.
6743900	6746900	Download the Yahoo screen app, but if you already have...
6746900	6748900	Within months, it could become totally relevant.
6749900	6753900	And thank you guys from Communicon for coming and blessing us.
6753900	6754900	Good night!
6756900	6758900	And we will see you in Season 6.
6759900	6761900	And then a movie, and then beyond.
6761900	6762900	Thanks, you guys.
6762900	6763900	All right.
