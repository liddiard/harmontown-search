0	2280	All right, let's see here.
2280	3680	All right.
3680	5400	This is just some warm up music.
5400	7960	Get you guys nice and warm.
7960	10320	You warm yet?
10320	12960	All right, let's get this started then, finally, right?
15960	19320	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
19320	23520	Harman Town is now in session.
23520	26960	Please help me in welcoming your mayor
27040	30680	to the Harman Town stage, Dan Harman.
36440	38880	Thank you.
38880	40320	Is this the right mic to be using?
40320	41880	All right.
41880	45000	Welcome to our XOXO in Portland,
45000	49440	which is a festival about technological innovation.
49440	54640	We are into our third technological innovation.
54640	56600	I don't know which mic I'm supposed to be on,
57200	58920	but I don't know what happened with the iPad.
58920	60320	I don't think anyone cares.
60320	61480	We're innovating.
61480	62760	It doesn't matter.
62760	64000	I got two mics up here.
64000	67600	There's warehouses full of homemade video games
67600	71320	by a bunch of hippies and anarchists.
71320	73120	It's about independent thought
73120	76320	and not having that be automatically synonymous
76320	77760	with growing your own basil.
77760	81720	You can also have a computer involved
81720	82880	and think independently,
82880	84760	which I think is a very important thing.
84760	87520	You can automate your basil garden via laptop.
87520	89920	Oh, now you're making me miss Minecraft.
93400	95480	Spencer and I are both into a headlong
95480	97000	into a Minecraft addiction
97000	99080	that I don't think either of us has acknowledged
99080	101080	as like an actual movie of the week
101080	102360	heroin type of addiction.
102360	103520	It's really like,
103520	105680	I've done a lot of things obsessively
105680	107040	and compulsively in my life,
107040	108800	but Minecraft, Jesus Christ,
108800	111280	it's like masturbating with heroin or something.
112280	115240	Like coating your hand in heroin.
115240	116080	That's how you do it, right?
116080	117600	And rubbing it on your penis.
117600	118440	Yeah.
118440	121960	And like, but your penis is a special heroin penis
121960	124280	that has heroin receptacles on it.
124280	125120	Well, it's like,
125120	128040	well, my hand is made of syringes is how it works.
128040	129920	You see, I was thinking about that,
129920	133040	but then that turns you off.
133040	134200	Well, it turns me on.
134200	135400	Well, maybe they're like,
135400	136240	they're syringes,
136240	138360	but the needles are like those rubber,
138360	140880	like kind of like dog toy,
140880	143440	little sea anemone things.
143440	144680	They just make it grip.
144680	149120	And I was trying to get away
149120	151040	from the Freddy Krueger.
151040	152560	I mean, I thought that was more pleasant
152560	154120	than whatever you were just describing,
154120	155000	to be honest.
155000	157160	Well, yeah.
157160	160760	Any description of anything pointy going near your penis,
160760	162960	it's on me for going deep.
163960	165320	Anyways, hello, Portland.
165320	166160	We are,
168440	170160	good to meet you.
170160	171000	Yeah.
171920	174560	This is my second time at XOXO.
174560	175760	Different stage.
175760	176720	I wasn't here last year.
176720	178880	I was busy probably being fired or something,
178880	183200	but I love Portland and I love XOXO.
183200	185600	I think XOXO might be the first time I was at Portland.
185600	187880	It was the first one two years ago.
187880	191640	And now it's exploded as we hoped it might.
191640	196280	And the, you know, we're here in a,
196280	198120	I think you would call it a steel mill.
198760	199600	I don't know technically what it is.
199600	201880	Yeah, does anyone know what this building was used for?
201880	202880	A metal stamping.
202880	204920	A metal stamping factory.
204920	205760	That's awesome.
205760	206600	I don't know if factory is the word,
206600	208520	but it's a big grownup building.
208520	211720	It's a building for pre-industrial,
211720	213400	not pre-industrial, pre-war.
213400	215000	Where real things got done.
215000	216640	Yeah, where our dads,
216640	219000	where our mythical ghosts of our dads worked.
219000	220320	There's boots in the back.
220320	224840	There's shelves that are only there to hold stuff
224840	229400	with no, no, no, no, no thought lent to aesthetic.
229400	231200	Therefore now it's hip.
231200	233840	It's, we have a blue collar chic.
233840	235520	We're in a vast canyon.
235520	239120	I, if anyone here is over 40, you're in this place
239120	241040	and maybe you have all kinds of different connotations,
241040	243720	but all I can think about is Jennifer Beals.
245000	246440	What?
246440	247760	You're gonna have to explain that to me.
247760	250600	Well, yeah, you're 20, you're 12 years old.
250600	251440	What are you?
251440	253120	I'm 13 in December.
253200	255480	13 in life you got it.
255480	258120	13 in life you go.
258120	259720	Your crime is time
259720	263440	and you just got your baby teeth out.
263440	266160	There's a, there was a movie called Flashdance.
268320	270960	And I actually have, haven't seen it,
270960	273360	but most people my age saw it,
273360	276440	but it was like in the water, like fluoride.
276440	278160	Like, like we all know that there was a movie
278160	279000	called Flashdance.
279000	281440	If you're over, if you're my age, then you know,
281440	282680	there was this movie called Flashdance
283120	284320	and you know that in that movie,
284320	287280	a woman is a dancer and a welder
287280	290440	and you know that she dances and then pulls a chain
290440	293280	and then water pulls down, splashes down her.
293280	294840	And you know there's a steel mill involved.
294840	297560	You know that roughly the same thing's about Footloose.
297560	299760	Does she weld while dancing?
299760	301800	The steel mill became big in the 80s.
301800	304840	It was like a big, it was a place you went to dance,
304840	305880	like the steel mill,
306800	309240	until RoboCop finally put a quirk in that and said,
309240	311320	no, this is a place you go to fucking learn
311320	312640	to be a robot again.
314240	317400	I gotta recalibrate my baby food shooters.
319120	321560	How are your baby food shooters, by the way?
321560	323280	Was that a euphemism?
323280	325240	Yeah, for your heroin dick,
326480	328440	with its dog toy spines.
328440	331040	It's, you know, full of holes.
331040	332360	But good ones in a good way.
332360	335160	Heroin, oh, they're track marks, really.
335160	336920	They got oculus rifts here.
336920	338840	I didn't go to the arcade yet.
339160	340800	They got an independent arcade here.
340800	343720	They make independent games, which are always so awesome
343720	345520	because it's like back to the basics.
345520	347560	Do they take quarters?
347560	348480	No, not like that.
348480	349320	That's the bad part of the opens.
349320	351600	So they're even more indie than quarters.
351600	352680	Yeah.
352680	354840	They're most indie of all change.
354840	357840	Like the idea, you know, as we progress as a society,
357840	361440	we find new ways to make computers think more things faster.
361440	363840	And all too often, we then funnel that all
363840	366920	into graphics cards and go like, how can I keep this,
367000	370200	you know, okay, the fan can cool off this much processor
370200	371760	this amount of time.
371760	376520	So how many angles, how many triangles can we generate?
376520	378480	Are you talking about Minecraft again?
378480	380440	Well, indirectly I am, yes.
380440	382640	Because I think the other way is to go like, okay, no,
382640	384000	computers can do more now.
384000	387040	So let's like, actually, if it looks like Pac-Man,
387040	389440	you could have Pac-Man do more shit.
389440	391520	Like he could eat way more than a key.
392720	394840	We thought that was the most Pac-Man could ever eat
394840	395680	was a key.
395840	398240	I never got past cherries, if I'm honest.
398240	399920	Yeah, you gotta get to the key, bro.
399920	401120	Jeez.
401120	402560	What level is that?
402560	403400	I don't know.
403400	404240	What?
404240	405060	What were you gonna say?
405060	406560	What level is the key on?
406560	407840	It's like the maximum level.
407840	409600	You can't eat anything past a key.
412160	414160	And it makes sense, because why would you?
414160	416160	That's words to live by right there.
416160	417760	You can't eat a key.
418800	420920	All right, so here we are in Portland,
420920	424680	where my fiance and I keep thinking
424680	426320	we want to move to, and I keep...
426320	427160	Whoo!
428360	433320	I imagine there was a, okay, there was, you heard that.
433320	434160	A couple of people said move.
434160	435960	Yeah, a lot of people aren't into the idea.
435960	436800	Exactly.
438640	439960	I think there's a lot of people probably going,
439960	442160	don't move to Portland, you fucking asshole.
443560	446480	Not because of me, but just because everyone's
446480	448280	stopped moving to Portland, maybe.
448280	449120	I don't know.
449120	450840	I don't know how you guys feel about that.
450840	452880	Do you want everyone to move to Portland?
453800	454800	Some people do.
454800	455640	That's weird.
455640	456480	Only some, though, I mean.
456480	457320	Maybe they're new.
458760	459680	All the people in the front.
459680	460520	Yeah, we don't know what to do.
460520	461760	Don't move to Portland, and all the people
461760	463520	that moved to Portland, they're in the back,
463520	464760	because they just got here.
464760	467400	Everyone else hates us, come here.
467400	468880	It's a good time.
468880	469760	I don't know.
469760	473960	I'm also fascinated with the overcast weather thing,
473960	477360	because people in Portland are so apologetic for it,
477360	480720	and people from LA, they go, no, you don't understand.
480720	482680	I don't care, I hate the sun.
483000	485880	The sun is, it's-
485880	487480	You want to kick it in the sun balls.
487480	488440	Yeah.
488440	490040	I said that earlier on the sidewalk.
490040	490880	Yeah, I stole that from you.
490880	492400	I just fucking, I came to Portland,
492400	494240	I was looking forward to hiding from this fucking
494240	499200	yellow maniac, this fucking orange Hitler,
499200	504200	this spherical fucking Ayatollah,
504280	507400	lording over everything, demanding everything of you,
507400	508480	reflecting everything.
508480	511800	I think in Portland, I think I feel like their sidewalks
511800	514600	are more reflective, because they miss the sun so much,
514600	516840	that they're like, it'll be here one day,
516840	518920	and when it's here, there'll be a parade.
518920	521320	But you come from LA, and you're like,
521320	523200	why are you trying to simulate the fucking
523200	526040	godless desert that I came here from?
526040	528920	I want the gray skies, and the shade,
528920	532680	and the dark, boozy cloisters,
532680	535080	the independent video games, the yogurt.
537560	538400	No, there's no yogurt.
538400	539680	Yeah, is there no-
539680	541080	They don't like yogurt here.
542720	545880	I might've got them mixed up with the-
545880	546720	Yogurt Toby.
546720	548560	Seattle, I don't know.
548560	549640	Home of the yogurt.
549640	551680	Someone told me backstage that they like yogurt.
551680	552520	Here's-
554000	555920	One guy here likes yogurt.
555920	558120	Here's something else a guy told me backstage.
558120	559760	This is a little weird, and I don't want this guy
559760	562160	to kill himself, me telling this story, but-
562160	564480	We admire him in some ways.
564480	567200	This guy is fine, he should not be ashamed of himself,
567240	569240	but he should also understand that,
569240	571560	as I think he understood when he did this,
571560	574840	that he is the first person that has ever done this.
574840	577160	And I thought it was notable.
577160	582160	I was in the back hunched over a cooler,
582480	586800	getting my contractually required bottle of Kettle One
586800	590440	out of a few bags of ice, and now there's five people
590440	594380	who run back there, and it's goodbye evening.
595380	599580	But I was pouring a drink, and this guy came back,
599580	603020	and he, I'll do an impression of him,
603020	606060	and I, please sir, wherever you are,
606060	608620	don't feel bad about yourself, but I have to share this.
608620	609740	It's just interesting.
609740	612300	You did this to me, I get to do it to everyone.
612300	614600	I get to turn it into something.
615540	616620	You're part of something.
616620	620580	A guy, he came up and he said, Dan Harmon?
620580	621660	And I said, yes.
621660	626660	And he said, look, he said something very quickly
627300	631860	along the lines of, my friends told me not to do this,
631860	634100	and I thought maybe I shouldn't do it, but here we go.
634100	637060	And he, and I was like, oh my God,
637060	638460	this is how John Lennon died.
641540	643020	But he pulled out a phone, and I was like,
643020	644860	oh, he wants a picture, I'm a very handsome person.
644860	646660	I approve of this.
647720	650700	But then he opened the phone, and then he just opened it up,
650720	653740	and he went like, I'm gonna make this up
653740	655620	because I think this kind of person values
655620	657060	the intellectual property he was reading,
657060	658300	so I'll make a new thing up.
658300	660980	But he's like, Alan Alda plays a Midwestern man
660980	663140	who was transported to a different dimension.
663140	666100	And he just rattled off, he just read a pitch
666100	667420	off of his phone.
667420	669060	He just read it off of his phone.
669060	670400	That's so much guts, though.
670400	673360	I could never do anything close to that.
673360	676260	Why, because of your conscience?
677700	678700	Yeah, yeah.
678740	683740	What horrible wall is between you and that brave act?
683780	685020	Empathy!
685020	686500	I mean, Murph. Empathy!
686500	688140	Empathy!
688140	691180	Empathy is what stands, it is not a wall!
691180	693340	It is an invitation!
693340	694180	Empathy.
694180	695460	It's not a wall?
695460	699740	It's not a wall that keeps you from being a sociopath.
701780	703780	It's not like video games where there's a thing
703780	707020	you can't do, so you just fuckin' try to do it.
708020	712540	The walls in society are there sometimes.
713940	714780	Because...
716980	718780	Very brave, though, very brave.
718780	720020	Very brave.
720020	720860	Murdered?
720860	722380	He's been arguably brave.
722380	724220	Yes, no one denies that.
724220	725060	Murdered is brave.
725060	727100	Here are some other brave people throughout society.
727100	727940	Hitler.
727940	728780	Abe Lincoln.
728780	729780	Hitler.
729780	731220	John Wayne Gacy.
731220	732340	Jeffrey Dahmer.
732340	733340	Taylor Swift.
733340	734580	Taylor Swift.
735580	736900	Kanye West.
736900	739020	Kanye West running up and saying,
739020	741900	Taylor Swift, give me that microphone, fuck you.
741900	742740	It was brave.
742740	747740	And yes, bravery is an amoral descriptor.
747740	748980	Agreed, certainly.
748980	751780	It has nothing to do with good or bad.
751780	754060	There are brave Ted Bundy's,
754060	756100	there are brave George Washingtons,
756100	758700	there are brave Japanese senators,
758700	761780	there are brave Ku Klux Klan dragons.
762780	765940	It is brave to fuck with people.
767220	768060	It is.
768060	768900	Yeah.
769940	771820	It's terrible, but brave.
774220	775300	It's an interesting...
775300	778620	I meet some brave people, so did John Lennon.
781620	784740	John Lennon went out meeting one of the bravest people
784740	785900	he will ever meet.
785900	790900	So forgive me for not putting a high value on bravery.
794900	796780	I'm not putting a high value on it.
796780	800020	In my old age, as I travel the country,
800020	802100	I start to put something like,
802100	804020	tacked higher than bravery.
804940	806700	That's me, that's my self interest.
806700	808420	I'm like, oh, that's a tactful man.
808420	810900	I appreciate him more.
810900	814020	Maybe I'll conflagrate them and go like, you know.
814980	817980	It's brave to be that tactful.
817980	819460	Tax is brave.
820500	821340	No, it's not.
821340	823180	Tax can be brave in a tactless society.
823180	824740	Tax is very cowardly, I think.
824740	826740	I mean, not that I'm very tactful,
826740	829180	and I am very, I'm a huge coward.
829180	832980	I don't know how brave tact is, or how cowardly.
832980	836620	I mean, that's a huge question.
836620	841620	I am a, I don't think I have a right to say this
842300	847300	about myself, but just as a shortcut, a autistic type.
849500	852460	And a lot of my fans are like.
852460	853700	Spectromatic.
853700	858700	Sp, sp, sp, sp, sp, sp, yeah.
859100	861260	Aspergatastic.
862660	863660	Aspergistas.
863660	865300	And I love them.
865300	866780	And you yourself.
866780	867620	Yeah.
868580	871220	Spencer is my dungeon master, chauffeur,
871220	872820	and personal assistant.
872820	874420	And he picks me up in the morning,
874420	876020	and I get into your Subaru,
876020	879300	and we can drive for a half hour
879300	880620	and not talk to each other.
880620	881460	Yeah.
881460	883540	Sometimes you play your podcast of those guys
883540	884980	that play those Nintendo songs.
884980	888020	And then argue about what genre they are and stuff.
888020	890780	Yeah, I'm just listening to 16-bit music
890780	891860	from Spencer's youth.
891860	895300	It's like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
895300	898500	And then sometimes we'll listen to a podcast about,
898500	900900	you know, how bridges are made or dolphins.
900900	903700	And then sometimes we'll talk about Minecraft.
903700	905220	But we don't have to do anything.
905220	906420	I don't have to look at you.
906420	907460	We don't have to look at each other.
907460	908660	We'll never get mad at each other.
908660	910060	You'll never like slam a door,
910060	911660	and I'll be like, baby, what's up?
913500	915340	Just, you know, it's been a long time
915340	918100	since you said you appreciated me.
918100	921420	That is a luxury we have as Vulcans.
921660	922980	Yeah.
922980	924620	Then there's these handicaps
924620	926460	when we deal with other people.
926460	928340	They go, like sometimes they slam doors
928340	929580	and we go, what's going on?
929580	930420	I don't understand.
930420	931500	Well, it's been a long time
931500	932980	since you said you appreciated me.
932980	934700	Well, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
934700	936860	Also just close the door and be mad.
936860	939940	Yes, can't you just stop feeling things?
939940	944700	Isn't it on you, the thing that's making you cry?
944700	945540	Unplug it.
945540	950980	Why is this, why is the solution
950980	955380	to make me like fucking more that
955380	959420	when I'm still able to saw wood
959420	961900	while ignoring your feelings?
963540	967580	What if aliens attack and they go, quick, get them.
967580	969060	They're all crying.
971100	973380	You'll be the only survivor, Dan.
973380	974580	They will turn to us
974580	977540	and they will go, Asperger people, help us.
977540	980740	There are worm men from the moon attacking us.
980740	981980	And we'll laugh at them.
981980	982820	Yes.
982820	983660	And they'll perish.
983660	985500	Yes, and then they'll go, yeah, you're laughing,
985500	987100	you're human and then we'll die.
988820	990700	Anyways, what was my point?
990700	992860	I was saying like, I'm used to these interactions
992860	993700	and I value them.
993700	998700	I like people who can't make eye contact with me.
998940	1003180	I like people who want to have honest conversations
1003180	1006020	and sincere ones and get down to the nitty gritty.
1006020	1009660	But there's also, there is a cowardly version
1009660	1011180	of tactlessness.
1011180	1013940	There's the I don't make small talk version.
1013940	1016420	And then there's the, actually I do.
1016420	1018140	I am gonna say what's easy.
1018140	1021420	I am gonna just like barf up some weird shit
1021420	1023700	because I think that it's like some kind of weird
1023700	1027100	strategic way to put you off kilter
1027100	1028980	and make you vulnerable.
1028980	1030660	And you can see that technique being employed
1030660	1032580	and you're like, what are you trying to do?
1032620	1035900	So you think that saying hello, I like you
1035900	1037580	is like something weak people do.
1037580	1039620	So you're gonna say, you're gonna insult me
1039620	1044500	or put me off and I'm gonna hang a Star Wars medal
1044500	1047020	around your neck and go like, you're the first person
1047020	1050920	that ever barfed shit on me in an elevator.
1052180	1053460	But those people aren't, right?
1053460	1055180	Like that happens a lot.
1055180	1056740	To people who like.
1056740	1058260	Well to you, like people are like,
1058260	1060460	I'm sure everyone does this so I'm gonna,
1060460	1062380	but then all of those people are doing
1063180	1064580	that exact same thing.
1064580	1068580	Yes, I mean, but I would put a big asterisk on that
1068580	1071780	and say that anyone that likes me
1071780	1073340	is better than other people.
1073340	1077120	Like, I by and large, like, because by the time
1077120	1080660	you make it over those walls, like you are a marine.
1083060	1084540	You are a better person.
1084540	1087900	So even my worst fan I think would beat, you know,
1087900	1089780	Kevin Smith's best fan in a,
1091780	1092620	in a fan off.
1092620	1095100	I don't know, just in a general, like, I feel like,
1095100	1098980	and please, I hope that gauntlet doesn't get too thrown down.
1098980	1100420	That's the last thing I need.
1100420	1102500	Well that's weird because, you know,
1102500	1106020	if someone likes me, I'm a self-hating individual.
1106020	1109140	If someone likes me, I instantly hate them.
1109140	1111220	Like, I just, I don't trust them.
1111220	1112060	It's like, why?
1112060	1113020	Yeah, they need to earn your trust.
1113020	1114740	If they like you, they need to earn your trust.
1114740	1116980	Well because it's like, you, I mean,
1116980	1118780	what are you, what are you looking at?
1118780	1120940	I mean, just a big fat guy, right?
1120940	1123340	Do I have gold in my ear or something?
1123340	1124260	I don't, like, what do you want?
1124260	1125700	Do I have gold in my ear?
1125700	1128300	I usually do, that's the thing.
1128300	1129140	Do you usually do?
1129140	1132980	Yeah, I mean, it's a big problem in my life.
1132980	1135580	People are always trying to get out the gold in my ear
1135580	1137780	and it's, they're gold diggers.
1139140	1141700	Guest comptroller Spencer Crittenden, everybody, just to.
1141700	1142540	Thank you.
1143540	1147580	How many, there's no right or wrong answer
1147580	1149980	to how many people are, I know you're all,
1149980	1152860	you're all registered with XOXO so you can be in this room,
1152860	1154500	but how many of you in addition to that
1154500	1157260	are fans of Harmontown, the podcast?
1157260	1159940	Hey, that's nice. Oh, not that many, actually.
1159940	1161940	All right, well we should really be more on our game
1161940	1164500	than we have been the last half hour.
1164500	1167340	I apologize, I thought it was, most of these people are like,
1167340	1170500	when's he gonna talk about Pascal programming?
1173500	1177100	I'm sorry, I'm not going to.
1178140	1180100	When's he gonna talk about any kind of innovation
1180100	1181420	in any sort of medium?
1185220	1187540	I wanna meet somebody from Portland.
1187540	1189380	I don't know if there's any of those people here,
1189380	1193020	but I think we have to be more specific than that.
1193020	1195740	We wanna reward, usually at Harmontown what we do
1195740	1197820	is we bring up people who have traveled the farthest,
1197820	1199260	but that would be kind of pointless here
1199260	1200700	because we've traveled.
1200700	1202420	So I wanna meet a Portland person.
1203540	1206060	But how do you pick the right Portland person to talk to?
1206060	1206900	No.
1206900	1208100	Who's the person in New York?
1208100	1208940	Sorry, what?
1208940	1211420	Who's the closest to this point?
1211420	1214580	Whoever's closest to this geographic point,
1214580	1215780	we invert the whole thing.
1215780	1219460	Okay, who lives the closest to this abandoned steel mill?
1219460	1221540	We have some hands here.
1221540	1222540	I'm gonna vet you.
1223500	1227380	I have no way of proving it, but what's your name?
1227380	1229900	Stephanie, I live 18th and Morrison,
1229900	1232260	so I'm about 10 blocks away.
1232260	1233860	18th and Morrison, 10 blocks away.
1233860	1234700	10 blocks.
1234700	1236260	I got 10 blocks away, 10 blocks away.
1236260	1238060	I got 10 blocks, 18th and Morrison.
1238060	1239500	Pink hair, pink hair, lady in the pink hair.
1239500	1240740	How close do you live?
1240740	1241940	Sixth and cooch.
1241940	1243860	Sixth and cooch, I got sixth and cooch here.
1243860	1245580	Sounds disgusting, but.
1245580	1248860	Also intimately close, sixth and cooch.
1248860	1250180	I got sixth and cooch here.
1250180	1251660	Anybody close to the sixth and cooch?
1251660	1254620	I got a friend with blue hair pointing at a,
1254620	1256820	just randomly, oh, pointing, pointing, pointing.
1257340	1259180	All right, coming over there, coming over there.
1259180	1260780	Sixth and cooch, sixth and cooch.
1260780	1263660	Sounds closer than 18th and Morrison for no reason.
1263660	1266380	For all I know, we're on 17th and Moracooch.
1266380	1267220	All right.
1268380	1269620	All right.
1269620	1273020	Purple hair, where do you live?
1273020	1274460	13th and salmon.
1274460	1275820	13th and salmon.
1275820	1276660	Whoa.
1276660	1277500	Whoa.
1277500	1278340	Whoa.
1279420	1281580	All right, I'll take your word for it.
1281580	1282420	Sounds familiar.
1282420	1284300	I think the word salmon, I think we're on salmon,
1284300	1285140	or something.
1285140	1286140	Yeah, somebody.
1286140	1288660	All right, what's your name, young lady?
1288660	1291540	McKenna, are you willing to come up and talk to us?
1291540	1292820	We don't pick on people.
1292820	1295460	It's not like a, I'm not like Jim Norton, or.
1295460	1296300	Whoo!
1296300	1297140	Whoo!
1297140	1297980	Whoo!
1297980	1298820	Okay.
1300260	1301700	Also, I already forgot your name,
1301700	1302520	because I get nervous.
1302520	1303360	McKenna.
1303360	1304180	McKenna.
1304180	1305020	That's your first name?
1305020	1305840	Yeah.
1305840	1306680	Okay, kind of weird.
1306680	1307520	Yeah.
1307520	1308360	Okay.
1308360	1310260	Most people use it as their last name.
1310260	1311100	It's fine.
1311100	1313220	Let's give a round of applause to McKenna, everybody.
1313220	1314060	Whoo!
1317660	1319540	You can take that mic and have a seat.
1320620	1323480	Are you allowed to drink?
1323480	1324320	Yeah.
1324320	1325160	Do you want to drink?
1325160	1326000	I'm not drunk enough right now.
1326000	1326840	Oh.
1326840	1328820	Are you 21?
1328820	1329660	Yeah.
1329660	1330740	Okay, do you want a vodka?
1330740	1331740	That's all we have.
1331740	1333300	That would be amazing.
1333300	1335780	All right, so we have a basin of molten steel
1335780	1336660	in the back, too.
1336660	1337500	Okay.
1337500	1338340	You can mix it together.
1338340	1340980	I can make you iron pants.
1340980	1343940	Hey, Elizabeth, can you make McKenna a drink?
1345660	1348120	Elizabeth is our drink maker for the evening.
1348120	1348960	Whoo!
1349840	1350680	Thank you.
1352340	1355220	She also happens to be dating our producer,
1355220	1357100	Dustin Marshall, but I swear to God,
1357100	1359420	you can get this job just by working hard.
1359420	1360260	Yeah.
1360260	1361100	Yeah.
1363100	1368100	It's not, it's an egalitarian meritocracy at Harman Town.
1369300	1370620	There's absolutely no reason why
1370620	1372820	you couldn't absolutely replace her.
1372820	1375100	No foam head on that.
1375100	1375940	It's all foam-less.
1375940	1377620	If you talk to her after the show,
1377620	1380060	you know, within your conversation,
1380060	1381580	feel her out for weaknesses.
1381580	1385380	See if you can figure out a way to get in there.
1385380	1388060	This is my ultimate weakness happening at the moment.
1388060	1389460	What is it?
1389460	1391020	Being in front of a ton of people.
1391020	1391860	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1391860	1392680	Same here.
1392680	1393520	No, I hate it, too.
1393520	1394360	Yeah.
1395260	1397900	I mean, sorry, okay, yeah, you'll get used to it.
1397900	1400100	It doesn't, you have to just like,
1400100	1403300	I don't know, picture them in your underwear.
1404500	1405500	Okay.
1405500	1406740	And then they're like uncomfortable
1406740	1409700	because they're like, these haven't been washed in.
1409700	1410780	Well, that's mean.
1410780	1413100	She probably washes her underwear, come on.
1413100	1415540	Oh, yeah, picture them in my underwear.
1415540	1416380	Yeah.
1419860	1422940	So McKenna, it's gonna take me a while to get used to that.
1422940	1425180	One of your best friends is called McKenna.
1425180	1426020	I know, that's why.
1426020	1428620	It's like McKenna, like I want you to like
1428620	1429780	take a bullet for me.
1430420	1431260	I don't want to treat you nice.
1431260	1432420	I'll consider it.
1432420	1434020	We'll see how this conversation goes.
1434020	1435580	Okay.
1435580	1437220	All right, so McKenna,
1437220	1439660	what do you think of those people over on Cooch?
1443140	1444540	Seem kind of entitled.
1444540	1445380	Yeah.
1447380	1450220	I'm closer than Morris and everybody pay attention to me.
1450220	1453740	At least the worst is when people say couch, though.
1453740	1455220	That's how you like know their.
1455220	1456740	Is it spelled couch?
1456740	1457580	Yeah.
1457580	1458420	Oh, okay.
1458420	1460380	So it's the New York.
1460380	1461660	I've never seen the sign.
1461660	1463380	It's the New York Houston trap.
1464820	1466260	That's terrible.
1466260	1467100	Houston?
1467100	1469900	Houston, and then if you don't say Houston,
1469900	1471700	then you know, fuck this guy.
1471700	1472980	Kick him out of New York.
1472980	1475140	His crystal on his palm starts blinking.
1476540	1479940	Houston, they take you up and they drop you
1479940	1482140	into the Statue of Liberty's torch.
1483260	1486500	Same with Edinburgh, Scotland.
1486500	1487340	Edinburgh.
1487500	1490020	You say it like butter.
1490020	1491860	You go, Edinburgh.
1491860	1492820	Edinburgh.
1492820	1493660	Yeah.
1493660	1494500	Edinburgh.
1494500	1496100	Edinburgh.
1496100	1497140	Anyways, McKenna.
1499340	1501380	So how long have you lived in Portland?
1502820	1504740	Around 11 years.
1504740	1505580	Wow.
1505580	1507980	Okay, and so since you were three.
1507980	1508820	Yeah.
1511580	1514260	So you moved here from where?
1514260	1516060	I'm from Oregon.
1516060	1516900	Right.
1517220	1518060	You're still in Oregon.
1518060	1519340	An hour south of here.
1519340	1520340	All right.
1520340	1522820	Oh, so you just, you were like me in Wisconsin.
1522820	1526540	You were born in a vat in the suburbs,
1526540	1527820	kind of like somewhere in a basement.
1527820	1528660	Exactly, yeah.
1528660	1529820	Your parents hit you with a belt
1529820	1533700	and then you moved to the city.
1533700	1536660	All right, and said, I'm gonna show all of you.
1538820	1540820	Madison, this guy just yelled out.
1540820	1542900	Yes, that is a city in Wisconsin.
1547900	1550900	I think that's the guy that read me the pitch.
1550900	1553900	I'm like, I can't tell, I can't tell.
1553900	1555420	I don't think so.
1555420	1556260	It's bright.
1556260	1560060	The lights are bright, but I mean, you haven't lived
1560060	1561740	until, and then he's just reciting it.
1561740	1564020	And then he was like, hey, I figured what the hell?
1564020	1566140	And I'm like, yeah, what could it hurt you
1566140	1569020	to read me a pitch?
1572860	1574100	I don't have a pitch for you.
1574100	1574940	Thank you.
1574940	1576300	There's gonna be a gunshot from the back
1576340	1578500	and my career's gonna be over
1578500	1580220	for the dumbest reason in the world.
1580220	1581860	Not because you're dead though, right?
1581860	1584860	No, because the other guy is.
1584860	1585940	Because the other guy.
1585940	1589060	All right, try to keep track here.
1591300	1592860	Have you ever listened to this podcast?
1592860	1593700	I have.
1593700	1594540	Oh, okay.
1594540	1595380	Yes.
1600180	1603460	So my fiance and I have been to Portland now
1603460	1608460	probably like, I think between us five times.
1608460	1610900	The last time it got pretty severe,
1610900	1613660	the Portland thing, like where it gets in your blood.
1613660	1615020	Like if you're into it?
1615020	1615860	Yeah.
1615860	1616700	Yeah.
1616700	1618020	It happens.
1618020	1619340	We wanna move here.
1619340	1622660	So, and I can't get a read on the Portland people
1622660	1624020	because usually the next thing that happens
1624020	1626860	when you wanna move to a city is you talk to somebody
1626860	1631340	and they say, everyone feels that way, fuck off.
1631340	1632620	The reason you feel that way is
1632660	1634460	because nobody's moving here.
1634460	1636140	But you're a good example
1636140	1638340	because a lot of people come here like now
1638340	1641780	in the summertime and they're like, Portland's amazing.
1641780	1643980	And then they actually move here
1643980	1646300	and it's like 10 months of shit.
1646300	1647140	All right.
1648020	1650420	But when you guys say shit,
1650420	1653020	you mean my favorite thing in the world,
1653020	1655380	which is Blade Runner weather.
1655380	1656940	Obviously I have it left.
1656940	1657980	Yeah, yeah.
1657980	1659740	Every day is Blade Runner.
1660740	1663260	Like I don't wanna walk around
1663260	1665540	in a fucking awesome trench coat.
1665540	1670020	I think the shitty weather like creates cooler people
1670020	1673340	kind of like, you know, you go to somewhere sunny
1673340	1675500	and people are all right.
1675500	1677860	But you come here and everybody's like,
1677860	1681460	maybe a little angsty, but creative and making things.
1681460	1682980	Well, the sun is, I mean, the thing is
1682980	1685140	when you go to a restaurant,
1685140	1687900	there could be a culture where people say to you,
1687980	1692700	you know the best place to sit is right by the kitchen.
1692700	1696820	The source of all restaurants things.
1696820	1698260	That's where all the food is made.
1698260	1699580	That's what the sun is.
1699580	1701100	You don't wanna sit near the kitchen.
1701100	1702140	It's also where like, shit,
1702140	1704820	it's a fucking fusion reactor in the sky.
1704820	1706220	It's giving you cancer.
1706220	1708860	It's like, it's burning your children.
1708860	1713100	It hurts magnificent characters like powder.
1713100	1714100	Remember that guy?
1714940	1719860	That guy's the best our planet can do.
1719860	1721660	And he doesn't want the sun.
1721660	1722500	You know who powder is?
1722500	1723340	He didn't ask for it.
1723340	1724820	Yeah, he has psychic powers.
1724820	1728060	And he's not, yes, the sun technically,
1728060	1730900	like the kitchen in a restaurant, it makes things happen.
1730900	1733660	Yes, that's where the shrimp goes into the basket.
1733660	1736900	I don't want the booth next to the fucking kitchen.
1736900	1739020	I wanna be in the dark corner.
1739020	1742420	Like I wanna be an indirect result of the sun.
1742420	1743380	Yeah.
1743700	1746060	You appreciate the sun for what it did,
1746060	1747500	but you don't need to like watch it all the time.
1747500	1749900	Yes, I'm a fan of the sun.
1749900	1752980	Like it's like Paul Verhoeven.
1752980	1757780	Like good job a while ago.
1757780	1760060	You did good, you did good.
1760060	1763820	And for that, I will never turn my back on you.
1763820	1768820	Like the sun is the Quentin Tarantino of the solar system.
1769740	1773740	Like permanent decision made, I rely on you.
1773740	1775620	I think you were amazing.
1775620	1779860	I don't, you know, Kill Bill being a two-parter is fine
1779860	1781380	if that's what comes with it.
1788020	1793020	So, but does the rain get to you over time when you,
1793220	1794060	but you don't know,
1794060	1795740	because you were in Oregon already.
1795740	1796580	Like you...
1797540	1798860	Oregon?
1798860	1799700	Oregon.
1801980	1803900	Yeah, that's a small violation.
1803900	1808180	That's, I didn't say Oregon.
1808180	1809540	I said Oregon.
1809540	1810540	Oh, what?
1810540	1811980	I think that's what they were booing.
1811980	1812820	Again?
1812820	1813660	It's cool.
1813660	1814500	Okay.
1814500	1816780	I mean, that's a lame thing to hold your ground on.
1818820	1820300	That's one vowel.
1820300	1822620	Like, what do you guys do to Canadians?
1822620	1823820	I mean, I'm sure they come.
1824820	1827500	They probably call it Brigadoon here.
1829500	1830940	That doesn't make any sense.
1832220	1836100	But you were born under an umbrella.
1836100	1838580	Yeah, it does though.
1838580	1839420	Yeah.
1839420	1843460	Around like June when it's still like shitting on you,
1843460	1845340	you start to get a little...
1845340	1846980	That's the June gloom, right?
1846980	1847820	Yeah.
1847820	1849780	You start to get a little crazy.
1849780	1851100	And right now everybody's very happy.
1851100	1852980	Cause they're like, oh, the sun's out
1853140	1854220	and it's gonna start rain freezing.
1854220	1857460	Yeah, and like the Oregonians I think about now are like,
1857460	1861100	okay, I'm ready to start wearing coats again.
1861100	1861940	Like, I don't...
1861940	1864460	People are very conflicted about now.
1864460	1866220	I just realized we've been talking about the weather
1866220	1868020	in our podcast.
1868020	1869020	I'm so sorry.
1869940	1870980	I apologize.
1870980	1873100	What's the opposite of the weather in conversation?
1873100	1874700	Do you believe in God, McKenna?
1877340	1878700	Let's just skip to why not?
1878700	1881980	Well, after today, I'm questioning it.
1881980	1883740	Cause you made it so wonderful
1883740	1887340	that you're thinking of converting back to, you know,
1887340	1889420	were your parents religious?
1889420	1891420	No, not at all.
1891420	1892540	I never went to church.
1892540	1894660	Did you resent them for not being religious?
1894660	1895500	No.
1895500	1897180	Come on, you wanted a little bit of God.
1897180	1899780	I'm very open-minded because of it.
1899780	1901940	So they were nice intellectual parents?
1901940	1904540	Yeah, they let me go to church with like my friends
1904540	1907140	and I would go to church and be like, fuck, this is boring.
1907140	1908540	Like, what is happening?
1908540	1910620	And then you'd come home and they're like, I told you.
1910700	1913700	Like, I told you to go to an orgy.
1918540	1919900	Yeah, okay.
1919900	1921180	All right.
1921180	1922180	Fucking Portland.
1923700	1925940	They're sacrilegious here.
1925940	1930660	So what's the, what's the,
1930660	1933660	trying to think of the opposite of talking about the weather.
1933660	1935220	What's the worst thing you've ever done
1935220	1936380	to another human being?
1940820	1942340	That's a really hard question.
1942340	1943180	Yeah, I know.
1943180	1946620	I asked that of a podcast guest at one point
1946620	1948020	and he immediately knew.
1948020	1953020	And it was, he made, he made his brother drink his own pee
1954300	1958460	by just, he gave him, told him it was lemonade and.
1958460	1960340	I've definitely done a few things like that
1960340	1962700	when I was little or like dirt mixtures
1962700	1965140	that you give to like the neighbor girl, like.
1965140	1965980	No, no.
1965980	1967900	Oh, you want to play Mario Kart?
1967900	1969180	You drink this shit.
1969180	1971860	You know, the thing where you make the girl eat the dirt.
1971860	1974580	Like, no, you need to tell us about that.
1976500	1977540	Little hazing.
1977540	1978820	What did you, what's the dirt,
1978820	1981060	what's the dirt girl story?
1981060	1982260	Cause it's not universal.
1982260	1984980	I definitely, I mean,
1984980	1986620	there was definitely a little girl
1986620	1988540	that lived across the street from me
1988540	1991660	who was like probably five years younger or something.
1991660	1994260	So of course she was like super excited
1994260	1997180	to hang out with the older, like, I'm so cool.
1997180	1999980	You know, like hang out with the cool older girl.
1999980	2002300	And it was like, you know, torture.
2002300	2003740	So your instinct to haze.
2003740	2005860	Yeah, you're like, that's what we were just talking about.
2005860	2007700	People that like you, there was something wrong with them.
2007700	2010980	Put some dirt with like vanilla flavoring
2010980	2015300	and water in a cup and be like, hey, this is good.
2015300	2016140	Yeah.
2016140	2016980	Yeah.
2016980	2018020	And then she ate it.
2018020	2018860	Yeah.
2018860	2021260	And then like would go home and cry.
2021260	2022420	Cause she ate dirt.
2022420	2023260	Yeah.
2023260	2025220	How old were you at that point?
2025220	2026060	Maybe like.
2026060	2026900	23.
2027900	2031740	30, like 12 ish.
2031740	2032580	Yeah.
2032580	2033420	I don't know.
2033420	2035020	When you're like the biggest asshole.
2035020	2038260	Well, you don't have, you know, human, human people,
2038260	2042780	we don't have like a, what we define as a,
2042780	2044900	I don't know whether some people would call it morality.
2044900	2047380	Some people just call it a conscience.
2047380	2049460	Like we don't have that compass built into us.
2049460	2051540	We're the most adaptable species on the earth.
2051540	2052820	And you don't, you don't get there
2052820	2055180	by having some ingrained thing that we won't do.
2055180	2056500	Like we'll do anything to anybody
2056500	2058180	that our parents tell us is okay.
2058180	2061220	And we kind of like, we learn kind of over time,
2061220	2062060	we're like, oh, you know what?
2062060	2064260	Life is more fucked up if we keep doing shit
2064260	2065420	that we just want to do
2065420	2067460	and we don't start thinking about other people.
2067460	2069180	But like eight year olds are sociopaths.
2069180	2072340	They're, and they'll just like pull the wings off a shit
2072340	2073620	and like, like, like, yeah.
2073620	2077660	And they, I don't, I don't, what's unclear is do they learn,
2077660	2080180	do they biologically hit a point where they're like, okay,
2080180	2081780	I'm going to stop doing that or do,
2081780	2083260	or do you just have to stop them?
2083260	2086500	Like you kind of want to like make a big iron cube,
2086500	2088300	maybe in this steel mill
2088300	2092900	and like drop a bunch of human children into it
2092900	2094780	and just do a bunch of experiments.
2094780	2097060	But then you'd realize, wait, maybe I'm doing this
2097060	2100820	because I didn't learn how to be moral.
2100820	2101980	I don't know.
2101980	2104100	I know that, I know that your brain is made out
2104100	2106340	of all these like, you know, there's like,
2106340	2109740	there's a biological capitalistic like board meeting
2109740	2111380	in your brain every day
2111380	2114660	where different departments of your brain
2114660	2116740	kind of compete for resources.
2116740	2120700	And so when you're a kid, like if they say
2120700	2122620	that if you raise a kid in an environment
2122620	2124140	where it can't stand up,
2124140	2126180	and I think we should all try this tonight,
2128180	2131940	that if the kid comes out of that like two foot high,
2131940	2136260	like, you know, crawl space at an age after their legs
2136260	2138900	are fully able muscularly to walk,
2139060	2141740	even if you like give them like
2141740	2144620	regarding Henry physical therapy,
2144620	2146660	they will never because their brain,
2146660	2148300	that part of their brain,
2148300	2149740	the one that dedicates resources
2149740	2151500	to motor function in their legs
2151500	2153460	has long ago been zoned out
2153460	2156780	during some city board meeting in the brain.
2156780	2159020	I was like, no, there's no need to walk.
2159020	2162580	This person needs to navigate darkness
2162580	2165180	and crawl hand over hand and change light bulbs
2165180	2167220	or whatever they're doing down there.
2167260	2169900	Telekinesis maybe, I don't know.
2169900	2173540	Some people just realize how to only be an asshole
2173540	2174380	when they're young.
2174380	2178180	I think that it's possible,
2178180	2180500	I'd like to be more optimistic than this,
2180500	2182380	but I think it's possible that being,
2182380	2185700	that compassion might be like facial recognition,
2185700	2190700	walking, you know, being good with feng shui.
2192060	2194980	These might just be little talents we have
2195060	2199260	and being compassionate actually yields positive results,
2199260	2202380	long-term for kids on the playground, hopefully.
2202380	2203460	I'm sure it's that.
2203460	2204900	Yeah, I don't think it's inherent.
2204900	2205860	But that's a bummer though.
2205860	2208620	That's like, we're all like these empty canisters
2208620	2210580	of just flesh that are just waiting
2210580	2213180	to be either made into serial killers or saints.
2213180	2214020	Yeah, that's how it works.
2214020	2216940	And then we all land somewhere way between.
2216940	2218100	It's a bummer.
2218100	2219500	I guess.
2219500	2220340	I think it's awesome.
2220340	2221380	But it's also kind of, yeah,
2221380	2223140	it's kind of amazing at the same time
2223140	2226060	because then some people grow to be so amazing.
2226060	2226900	Yeah.
2226900	2228140	Well, it's the same odds.
2228140	2232420	But what about the lack of meaning to being amazing?
2232420	2233260	Why is it?
2233260	2235220	Like it just happens at random.
2235220	2237980	But the randomness makes it beautiful, you're saying?
2237980	2239340	I think so.
2239340	2240180	Why?
2240180	2242260	It's like the roll of a die.
2242260	2243860	But why is that more beautiful?
2243860	2247100	Why is chaos more beautiful than purpose?
2247100	2250620	Because it's like the antithesis of everything we seek.
2250620	2253300	It's like, oh, we're just going the wrong way about it.
2253300	2255220	We just got to accept that it's randomness
2255220	2257300	and derive meaning out of that.
2257300	2259260	I think that's cool.
2259260	2261860	I mean, it's one thing to like catch on to a meaning
2261860	2262700	that already exists.
2262700	2263900	That's like seeing a bird.
2263900	2265780	But it's another thing to like be all like,
2265780	2268580	I'm going to invent the bird.
2268580	2271340	It's a common example, I think.
2271340	2277340	We can all relate to creating our own foul, right?
2277340	2280220	So I say, I don't know if I have the ability
2280300	2281140	to articulate this.
2281140	2282620	You're saying that within,
2282620	2286020	if we accept that our nature is chaotic,
2286020	2290100	we can achieve a meta order.
2290100	2292140	Yeah, well also just that like, okay,
2292140	2295260	so if it was predestined that I was supposed to just say,
2295260	2296580	I mean, be here today.
2296580	2297940	That's not very interesting.
2297940	2300180	That's part of a list.
2300180	2301700	There's a long list of things.
2301700	2303300	Like the fact that I'm here
2303300	2305700	because of several crazy random factors
2305700	2307460	that could never happen to anyone else
2307460	2309620	just because of sheer probability and stuff,
2309660	2314420	I find that amazing and more potentially miraculous
2314420	2316380	than like someone with a plan
2316380	2318340	making the rules for everything.
2318340	2319180	I don't know.
2319180	2321500	Like our friendship is the result of a random occurrence.
2321500	2322780	You came to the show and I said,
2322780	2324060	is there a dungeon master here?
2324060	2326340	And you raised your hand and now we're friends.
2326340	2329820	And more than friends, employees.
2329820	2330660	Or else it's Ryview.
2330660	2331940	Yeah.
2331940	2332900	I wear many hats.
2332900	2337900	But that same chaos means that I could have a strange
2338460	2340740	happening in my brain that makes me lunge across the table
2340740	2341580	and rip your face off.
2341580	2342420	Because I think it's a sandwich.
2342420	2345540	Which is also really fascinating, right?
2345540	2346500	But you will die.
2346500	2349820	Will you die going like, ah, life, I'll take three.
2351100	2352740	I don't think you can take three.
2352740	2354260	That's the problem, right?
2354260	2355660	All right, maybe that's my problem.
2355660	2356940	I want to buy life in bulk.
2356940	2359620	Maybe it's just that I'm a dungeon master though
2359620	2362540	because I just, everything I do is rolling dice.
2362540	2363820	It's all randomness.
2363820	2365420	And then when you start to understand
2365420	2367620	that those same rules of dice rolling
2367660	2370580	are just genetics and particle collisions.
2370580	2373180	It's all just all these weird probabilistic things
2373180	2374020	that happen.
2374020	2376380	It's, I think that's just like understanding
2376380	2377500	the code to the universe.
2377500	2380860	And the idea that your brain is,
2380860	2383380	while it's looking at the die rolls,
2383380	2385500	is the result of a bunch of die rolls
2385500	2387580	over billions of years.
2387580	2389940	And hundreds of billions of years if you go,
2389940	2391860	I mean like the big bang forward,
2391860	2394200	like random collisions turning into RNA,
2394200	2396620	turning into primordial soup,
2396620	2399820	turning into evolutionary cold war,
2399820	2401460	hot war between organisms,
2401460	2404140	resulting in the biological weapon survival-wise
2404140	2405200	that is your brain,
2405200	2408180	that in addition to recognizing red apples
2408180	2411480	and yellow bananas is able to recognize numbers on a die
2411480	2414380	and create a game that is based on random numbers.
2414380	2419380	So you're using the end result of a bunch of randomness
2419460	2422020	to look at infantile randomness,
2422020	2424900	simulations of fundamental randomness,
2424900	2426020	and we have fun,
2426020	2427920	and we pretend that there's order,
2427920	2430600	we pretend that there's good guys and bad guys,
2430600	2434900	and we seek meaning but you can find peace
2434900	2437160	by accepting that there is no meaning.
2437160	2439400	Yeah, and I mean, what you're talking about order is like,
2439400	2441800	the only order is what we add to it, you know?
2441800	2444860	It's what we're ordering around in the randomness.
2444860	2446700	I think that's a cool part of it.
2447620	2449360	Thanks, man, I appreciate that.
2450500	2452320	This episode of Carment Town is brought to you
2452320	2453460	by Fulton and Roark.
2453460	2455380	Jeff, you're sick of spilling
2455380	2456940	all your colognes all over the place.
2456940	2458660	You hate liquid colognes, is that correct?
2458660	2459860	It's my nemesis.
2459860	2461540	It's the thing that gives me
2461540	2463180	nightmare dreams all night long.
2463180	2465460	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you
2465460	2468620	just covered in sticky wet cologne.
2468620	2471740	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne
2471740	2474460	that I wear, and then my luggage smells
2474460	2476940	like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
2476940	2479540	Yeah, but Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance
2479540	2481340	and grooming company that specializes
2481340	2483620	in solid colognes, shave and shower products,
2483620	2485700	all designed to make getting ready easier
2485700	2486540	and more enjoyable.
2486540	2487820	Now, when you say solid colognes,
2487820	2489480	do you mean like solid in the jazz sense?
2489480	2492020	Like, wow, that jazz solo was solid.
2492020	2493300	You know, I do mean that,
2493300	2495780	but I also mean physically solid as well.
2495780	2497340	Oh, like a little, like you're talking about
2497340	2500100	a wax-based cologne that travels in a little small package
2500100	2502500	that I can't spill all over my luggage
2502500	2506420	and smell like a Mexican tip house.
2506420	2508860	So these are travel-friendly wax-based colognes
2508860	2509700	that can go anywhere.
2509700	2511620	Plus, there's nothing to break or spill,
2511620	2513740	and of course, they all smell fantastic.
2513740	2514580	Fantastic.
2514580	2516220	Like a Mexican tit house.
2518300	2521820	I mean, there's different levels of Mexican tit house.
2521820	2523800	I mean, there's the high-quality ones,
2523800	2525620	there's the ones that you wish you didn't go to.
2525620	2526780	Right, yeah.
2526780	2528660	Titos fantástico.
2528660	2532100	Is one of their fragrances called Mexican tit house?
2532100	2533340	Yeah.
2533340	2534540	Que fantástico.
2535980	2537860	Fulton and Roark's bar soap is designed
2537860	2540460	to exfoliate the skin with or without a washcloth.
2540460	2541820	Also, you don't even have to touch it.
2541820	2543780	It comes and does it in the night.
2543780	2545900	Well, that's amazing.
2545900	2548020	That's literally unbelievable.
2548020	2549780	Did you know, Spencer, that GQ magazine
2549780	2551340	just named their shave cream
2551340	2553420	the very best on the market today?
2553420	2555300	Well, yeah, of course I knew that.
2555300	2556140	Why would you ask?
2556140	2557140	I mean, who am I asking?
2557140	2559100	I mean, this guy, you go to this house,
2559100	2560620	it's like an episode of Hoarders.
2560620	2563260	So many back issues of GQ magazine there.
2563260	2564260	Right, and I gotta tell you,
2564260	2566620	my house is made out of bricks of cologne.
2566620	2567900	Wax-based cologne, I hope.
2567900	2568820	Yeah, yeah.

2599500	2601620	By Fulton and Roark.
2602900	2604700	But what does that have to do with Pussy?
2607020	2609860	Can you hear me, Portland?
2609860	2611020	More like Pussyland.
2612620	2613740	Sorry, sorry.
2616340	2618300	Speaking of Pussy, let's bring my fiance up here,
2618300	2619140	Aaron McGathey.
2619220	2620060	Yay!
2622460	2624420	We have to figure out, I'm gonna stand.
2625860	2630740	Is there, I think, we don't have enough,
2630740	2631740	there's another mic.
2631740	2632740	Aaron, you set.
2632740	2634060	I can coach it.
2634060	2634980	No, no, no.
2634980	2636140	Well, that's, I don't know.
2636140	2637900	No, I want you to set, like,
2637900	2639700	on the pedestal that you belong on.
2641260	2642260	Am I staying up here?
2642260	2643100	Am I staying up here?
2643100	2643940	I don't wanna be put on a pedestal.
2643940	2645300	You're giving me down by putting me up.
2645300	2646860	And McKenna, you stay seated.
2646860	2647700	Oh, sorry.
2647700	2649140	You're from Portland.
2650020	2654060	Can I, not to be a girl, but I love your hair.
2654060	2655100	Oh, thank you.
2655100	2656340	Looks great.
2656340	2659100	You're like a mermaid mare of a fairy grove.
2659100	2662060	Yeah, well, I've seen a ton of girls
2662060	2664140	with purple in their hair, and I was kind of like,
2664140	2666740	I wanna, like, gather all of us together
2666740	2669940	and get, like, a group purple hair shot.
2669940	2672580	Because I feel like most people have,
2672580	2674420	I'm down for any color.
2674420	2677140	But purple seems to be a popular one.
2677140	2678860	I felt like when I was looking for people
2678860	2681860	that were lived closer to this steel mill,
2681860	2683660	the hair got more purple as...
2683660	2687260	I hope five years from now,
2687260	2689420	we don't find out this is some kind of cluster.
2689420	2690260	It's a cool color.
2690260	2691980	Remember a couple weeks ago when you came home
2691980	2693060	and my hair was gray?
2693060	2694340	I was trying to do that.
2695940	2698100	I love the gray, actually.
2698100	2700620	Like, I've thought for fall, I might go gray.
2700620	2702420	Oh, man, that look amazing.
2702420	2704580	It's like witchy, witchy, yeah.
2704580	2707020	Have you seen the gray with Liam Neeson?
2707460	2708300	Yeah.
2710300	2712100	That's what I'm going for.
2712100	2712940	I haven't seen it.
2712940	2715540	It doesn't matter what color your hair is.
2715540	2716940	The wolf will eat you.
2717980	2721660	He's a predator, a biological killing machine.
2721660	2723740	He doesn't care about your hair.
2723740	2726260	It doesn't matter if we make a fire.
2726260	2728100	Doesn't matter if we wake up.
2728100	2730580	Doesn't matter how many legs you have.
2730580	2732860	Doesn't matter if they're in the snow.
2732860	2737420	Doesn't matter if we walk five feet or 500 feet.
2737420	2740380	It doesn't matter that we're here.
2740380	2744660	The wolves may walk by, not see us.
2744660	2747580	It doesn't matter if they don't see us.
2747580	2749060	They might smell us.
2749060	2752540	Dan, if the sequel to the gray took place in Portland
2752540	2755860	and there was that same monologue,
2755860	2757340	what would that sound like?
2757340	2759660	It doesn't matter if they're on cooch.
2759660	2764580	It doesn't matter if they're in the sandy hut.
2764580	2767020	Doesn't matter if they enjoy shuffleboard.
2767860	2770500	If they're a day drinker or a hipster drinker.
2770500	2772660	It doesn't matter if they innovate.
2772660	2774700	It doesn't matter if they remember
2774700	2776540	that they used to make yogurt hair.
2776540	2780860	It doesn't matter if the video game is independent
2780860	2783100	or corporate.
2783980	2787220	It doesn't matter if women are properly represented
2787220	2788860	in the video game genre.
2790140	2791740	The wolf will still eat you.
2794420	2796980	We're arguing about whether or not
2796980	2798900	Tomb Raider should have big tits,
2798900	2800580	but the wolf just sees a hot dog.
2809580	2811900	I want to talk about one thing.
2813460	2815780	Hot dogs, yes, I got very hungry just now.
2815780	2820780	I want to talk about the plane ride here
2822820	2825820	and the fact that I've noticed this
2825820	2827700	because I've traveled by plane enough
2827700	2829900	to know that this isn't a fluke.
2829900	2833420	Sometimes, okay, let me start with all the time.
2833420	2835020	All the time.
2835020	2837180	The food is bad.
2837180	2838860	Yes, yes.
2838860	2840500	The peanuts are too small.
2840500	2844300	The every time without exception,
2844300	2846620	everyone in this room who's ever been in a plane,
2846620	2848420	no one will argue with this.
2849420	2851260	Every time you're on a plane,
2851260	2853940	the position of your seat back
2853940	2858180	is catastrophically important to them,
2858180	2862220	the people who are in charge of whether you live or die.
2862220	2864100	Because the plane is a piece of equipment
2864100	2866260	that is defying physics, flying through the air,
2866260	2870260	like a metal fucking rock and you're in it
2870260	2875260	and your seat being back or forward to them is a big deal.
2876540	2880900	You, for instance, if you'd like to test this theory,
2880900	2884460	try keeping your seat back the whole time.
2885620	2888860	They won't let you, we all know this, we accept it.
2888860	2891980	Your seat has to be forward when you land.
2891980	2896900	Now, sometimes, and I find this very interesting,
2896900	2899420	sometimes your seat doesn't work.
2900500	2903140	Now, the reason I find this interesting
2903140	2906660	is because the times your seat doesn't work
2906660	2910540	is because the airline is shitty
2910540	2913140	and the airplane isn't working right.
2913140	2917260	And it is those times, not when you need your seat
2917260	2920660	to be back, it is their failure
2920660	2923020	that immediately solves the problem.
2923020	2924580	I find that very interesting.
2924580	2926860	I feel like she already knows this story.
2926860	2928420	She's annoyed by it, but I'm like,
2928420	2931860	I'm not, I find this very interesting.
2931860	2933700	I've had this conversation so many times
2933700	2938620	where my seat is kind of half back
2938620	2940020	and the person comes by and they go,
2940020	2943140	I really need that seat to be up before we land.
2943140	2946060	And that could have been a woman or a gay man.
2948660	2952100	And I go, hey man, you try.
2952100	2954700	Make it go, make it do what you need it to do
2954700	2955700	in order for the plane to land.
2955700	2956900	And they go, oh, it doesn't work.
2957140	2958660	And they go, okay, fuck it.
2958660	2962940	Fuck it, fuck it because it's our fault.
2962940	2965700	Fuck it because the plane doesn't work.
2965700	2968700	It's a crisis if it's on you.
2968700	2970420	It's fuck it if it's on them.
2971500	2973340	Hey, I'm sorry, we really need that engine
2973340	2974660	to be on the wing.
2975660	2977540	Well, the engine's not on the wing.
2977540	2979340	It came disconnected up in the air.
2979340	2982780	The plane is doing a fucking barrel roll toward the soil.
2982780	2984540	Oh, okay, well, sorry, fuck it.
2985540	2986460	I hope you live.
2988020	2989380	I'm on your side.
2994780	2999780	But the, and I get it, I get your frustration.
3000740	3003260	But that guy coming by, he just has to,
3003260	3006140	his big crisis is that he wakes up every day
3006140	3009220	and has to tell a bunch of people in an airplane in 2014
3009220	3013020	to not smoke in an airplane and to do all these things.
3013100	3014700	And then he's walking, I mean, he said fuck it
3014700	3016540	because that's how he feels.
3016540	3021220	But what if you were a secret flyer?
3021220	3022060	What is that?
3022060	3025900	Oh, a person who's like a death's head officer
3025900	3028060	that's there, pretending to be a tourist.
3028060	3030300	He's like, aha, my seat can go back.
3030300	3033060	You just need to try harder, prisoner number 137.
3034300	3035140	Okay, great.
3035140	3036340	I understand your frustration.
3036340	3037740	I have a personal connection to this
3037740	3038940	because after this happened,
3038940	3041660	I was awaking from a beautiful nap.
3041660	3043860	I overheard the interaction, which is fine,
3043860	3045620	because I have similar interactions.
3045620	3047260	And then I unfortunately said to you,
3047260	3048700	well, I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
3048700	3053460	And then I was on the other side of the Gaza Strip.
3054580	3055580	The next couple of hours.
3055580	3058300	Because the Gaza Strip is a line on a ping pong table.
3058300	3062420	That's what I, that is what I heard.
3062420	3064620	No, no, the other side of the, you know,
3064620	3065460	you know what I mean.
3065460	3068140	The point being, and what I said to you is,
3068140	3069660	of course it's not a big deal.
3069660	3070860	That's the tyranny.
3072060	3074380	Of course it's not a big deal.
3074380	3075460	There's not, no one's gonna,
3075460	3077300	of course no one's gonna hit me with a writing problem.
3077300	3080180	Can we talk about the body scanning machines?
3080180	3083060	Uh, how you opt out and I don't.
3083060	3084780	I opt out.
3084780	3086740	Thank you.
3086740	3088620	The more you said opt out,
3088620	3090620	the sooner that those things are fuckin'
3090620	3091980	taken out of the airports.
3091980	3093100	You know who doesn't opt out?
3093100	3096380	Who loves just getting fucked in the anus
3097460	3099140	with an airplane wing.
3101740	3104100	Well let's not knock that, that's a lot of fun.
3104100	3105420	It actually sounds great.
3105420	3107020	It's kind of tapered at the end
3107020	3109500	and then they get slowly bigger toward the body of the plane.
3109500	3110980	There's a lot of variety.
3110980	3112500	Then there's an engine in the middle of it
3112500	3115020	with like a suction like turbine.
3115020	3115860	It's a real good set.
3115860	3118460	I'm going from here to Tarzana, California
3118460	3120660	to market the airplane wing dildo.
3121980	3124380	When you opt out, don't you get like.
3124380	3125220	Harassed?
3125220	3126380	Yes, exactly.
3126380	3128980	You like, every time I opt out,
3128980	3132540	I get taken to like the little room.
3132540	3135700	Oh do you say, do you opt in to get taken to a private room?
3135700	3140700	No, it'll be like, they test something on your clothes
3140740	3142820	and then they're like, oh it's a hair gel
3142820	3145180	that's setting the alarm off.
3145180	3147460	We have to take you back for a search.
3147460	3148300	You gotta stop wearing that.
3148300	3150460	Maybe this is just the Portland airport.
3150460	3153100	I think you have to stop being an Italian porno's.
3155100	3157220	I just had bad luck, I don't know.
3157220	3158860	I mean I have a very mixed experience.
3159580	3162860	It's not great, but I think most people are pretty nice.
3162860	3164580	Though there are some airports where they're like,
3164580	3166180	you're opting out?
3166180	3168740	Huh, she's opting out.
3168740	3173140	What, what, we got, she's opting, all right, noted.
3173140	3175300	And then an hour later someone comes over
3175300	3176740	and I'm not going to disclose
3176740	3178820	what part of the country that was, but.
3178820	3181260	They've definitely been instructed, it's out.
3181260	3182480	They can't keep a secret.
3182480	3183820	It's not like it's the fucking.
3183820	3186460	Yeah, though today I had a very nice conversation
3186460	3190300	and I, you know, I've become, as I've gotten older,
3190300	3193460	I've really cherished my female friendships.
3193460	3197460	And there is something to staring in the eyes
3197460	3201580	of a strange TSA woman who says to you,
3201580	3206580	I'm going to take my hands up between your legs until I,
3206820	3210020	the first several times I did this, I got this line
3210020	3211740	until I think they corrected it.
3211740	3214180	I'm going to take my hands up your thighs
3214180	3215980	until I meet the resistance.
3216460	3221460	And the first time I was like, the resistance.
3222060	3224460	Yeah, they're hiding out in there.
3224460	3225780	They got a base of operations.
3225780	3227780	All right, I'm solo.
3227780	3229580	Thank you for fighting the good fight.
3229580	3230660	Until I meet the resistance,
3230660	3232380	you're supposed to say resistance,
3232380	3235820	which also I don't like to think of my pussy as resistance.
3235820	3237220	I don't want it, I don't want to think of it
3237220	3240100	as a portal either, but I don't want to think of it
3240100	3242420	as some sort of like force field.
3242420	3243260	It's not like.
3243260	3245040	Kathy cartoon, hashtag Kathy cartoon.
3245080	3248800	But today I had a really nice conversation
3248800	3251600	with this young woman who was like, oh, airports, right?
3251600	3253120	And I'm like, you're telling me
3253120	3254840	as she's like touching my boobs.
3254840	3256840	And I'm like, this is cool.
3256840	3259040	That we can have this moment, like, you know,
3259040	3261880	which is used to dance in the forest and.
3262960	3266280	I like the idea that your vagina is the resistance.
3266280	3268040	Cause I like, I like that you're,
3268040	3270800	I love you for your humanity.
3270800	3274920	And I, when I think of the resistance, I think of the TV,
3275520	3279600	mini series event V from the eighties.
3279600	3284080	Like I think of your vagina as like spray painting
3284080	3287800	over propaganda that was put there by aliens and going like,
3287800	3288840	fuck it, we can fight.
3288840	3292040	And I'm like, yeah, I love, I love this vagina.
3292040	3297320	It fights, you know, it like.
3297320	3298160	I moved.
3298160	3300520	I mean, it does make you feel like a battleship
3300520	3302720	a little bit where they're like, do you have any devices?
3302720	3304840	No, ma'am, I do not, but I could.
3304840	3308680	Yeah, I could have some, some devices.
3308680	3309520	That's a thing.
3309520	3311160	I'm just learning about this.
3311160	3312280	You, you, you.
3312280	3313520	Dan, before you say anything,
3313520	3315440	this is my own expression that I came up with.
3315440	3317160	It's not like common vernacular.
3317160	3319680	Well, no, but I want to, I mean, it's intuitive though.
3319680	3320520	Yeah, exactly.
3320520	3321360	Yeah.
3321360	3322280	You know what I mean when I say of kangaroo.
3322280	3324960	Who hears kangaroo before?
3324960	3325800	Nope.
3325800	3326640	No.
3326640	3330960	Let's say you're just being dishonest across the country.
3330960	3331880	I don't believe that.
3331920	3333000	They're just lying out there.
3333000	3333840	Yeah.
3333840	3335400	Like you guys didn't go to a concert
3335400	3336240	where they were searching for.
3336240	3337080	I don't know if they know what I mean.
3337080	3339120	She means putting a nickel bag of marijuana
3339120	3343000	in your vagina or, or anything that might need
3343000	3344520	to get through some kind of checkpoint.
3344520	3348600	You've never, no one in Portland has ever used
3348600	3350200	their birth chamber.
3350200	3355200	No, it takes a lot to see the nobility in kangarooing.
3356880	3358600	I do those, you know, I don't opt out.
3358600	3360160	I go through the back scanner machines
3360160	3363480	and every time I like, it's probably psychosomatic,
3363480	3367160	but every time I just like my balls hurt afterwards.
3367160	3370200	It's like there, I could just feel, you know,
3370200	3371920	all those little guys dying.
3371920	3373400	I feel, I feel lightheaded.
3373400	3374520	I always feel lightheaded.
3374520	3375360	It's weird.
3375360	3377440	It's gotta be like, it can't really be happening, right?
3377440	3380160	It's all, but, but then again, what would make more sense?
3380160	3382200	I mean, what, if there's anything useful happening
3382200	3385400	in that machine to them, then of course it's like,
3385400	3386240	you could feel it.
3386240	3387060	I don't know.
3387060	3389560	I felt really good about my decision to opt out
3389600	3393440	when early on some TSA agent said to me,
3393440	3396880	oh, you know, they took out a 70% of the radiation.
3396880	3397720	Do you know that?
3397720	3399600	They took out 70% and then another guy was like,
3399600	3400520	no, a hundred percent.
3400520	3402920	I was like, fuck, you know, no, you're talking about it.
3402920	3404520	They took, they were like, oh, we should,
3404520	3406280	we should really take out this radiation.
3406280	3407120	They can't take out.
3407120	3408640	That's not the way, that's not the way it works.
3408640	3411200	Like it's salad dressing, like they're like, yeah, no,
3411200	3412040	there's hydrochlorophores in there.
3412040	3414640	Because they're trying to see the only thing that they,
3414640	3417560	God, it's in the same way that I fucking resent
3417560	3418720	when I go to Urban Outfitters
3418720	3420000	and I'm trying to return a sweater.
3420000	3422200	And someone's like, oh, have you worn this?
3422200	3424440	Like when I, when I haven't and I, no,
3424440	3426200	I have not worn the sweater, I don't know.
3426200	3428520	And it's like, is your last name Urban Outfitters?
3428520	3431360	I know you're making $10 an hour and I'm a human being
3431360	3432320	and you're a human being.
3432320	3434360	And guess what's not a human being is Urban Outfitters
3434360	3438160	fucking take my sweater, right?
3438160	3439240	H&M is worse.
3439240	3442560	And then the same way with the TSA agents,
3442560	3443600	when they're like, yeah, you know,
3443600	3444480	they took out the radiation.
3444480	3446200	It's like, what the, what, what?
3446200	3447760	On your death bed, are you gonna say,
3447760	3449400	I was a company man.
3449400	3453920	But like, it's a, it's a radiation dispenser.
3453920	3454760	That's its job.
3454760	3456640	How do they take out the radiation?
3456640	3457480	No, exactly.
3457480	3458720	It's just a box.
3458720	3461320	I looked it up afterwards and there's nothing to it.
3461320	3464840	One guy one day was, I have ice in my mouth like a.
3464840	3467320	There's an urban legend or it's true,
3467320	3468560	but I will say it's an urban legend
3468560	3469720	because then I want to spread things that are,
3469720	3471920	I don't want to be, I don't want to be totally irresponsible,
3471920	3475000	but there's a, you know, there's,
3475000	3477920	legend has it that the guy that invented that machine
3477920	3479480	won't go through it.
3479480	3480720	Like, that's the thing.
3480720	3482640	How many, how many people, you're Portland,
3482640	3484760	do you guys opt out when you go to the airport?
3484760	3489760	The, Portland has a beautiful airport, don't they?
3489880	3492040	I mean, they kind of, it's pretty nice.
3492040	3493400	They have cool little shops and stuff.
3493400	3496040	I opt out because of the philosophy of it,
3496040	3500120	because of the big brother bullshit of it.
3500120	3501800	And, but what would you say to somebody that said,
3501800	3503800	well, what about a metal detector?
3503800	3505240	I mean, just because we had.
3505240	3506080	No, that's fine.
3506080	3507680	But I mean, with the, well, exactly.
3507680	3509680	I mean, with the, I don't know.
3509680	3512560	I, I'm going to, I'm not the,
3512560	3516320	I'm not the voice of this cause, but the,
3516320	3518920	the idea of, I mean, the,
3518920	3522640	those body scanner machines really don't detect that much.
3522640	3525520	And if someone is really trying to smuggle something,
3525520	3527320	they can, it just seems to me
3527320	3529000	that they're developing technology
3529000	3531640	so they can take pictures of us all the time.
3531640	3533720	And so they can just ease shit in.
3533720	3534560	I don't know.
3534560	3536400	It's a little conspiracy theories of me,
3536400	3537640	but also I'm like, fuck you.
3537640	3539320	I just paid $500 for a flight
3539320	3541160	and I have to stand with my arms out
3541160	3542720	and there are pictures of what it looks like
3542720	3543840	on another screen.
3543840	3545360	And then, I don't know.
3545360	3546200	It just bugs me.
3546200	3548080	And also not everybody has to do it.
3548080	3550120	It goes back and forth and it's like, well,
3550120	3551240	then what is the point of this?
3551240	3554560	It's just a, it's just like a slow control thing.
3554560	3555720	Like TSA was bored.
3555720	3557520	And so they came up with this fucking thing.
3557520	3559600	I hope I can fly on.
3560440	3563040	I hope that H&M and Banana Republic,
3563040	3564240	or whoever you were talking about,
3564240	3566320	maybe the next podcast Erin will just be naked.
3566320	3569160	She's being boycotted by all the clothes.
3569160	3571680	They come to the house and take all my clothes.
3571680	3573960	The, God damn it.
3573960	3578160	There was, McKenna, how you doing over there?
3578160	3579720	Oh, I'm good.
3579720	3581360	How's your nightmare of being in front of people?
3581360	3583760	Reliving all my airport experiences right now.
3583760	3586360	Yeah, not to harp on this topic,
3586360	3589600	but like, look, find this on YouTube.
3589600	3592720	There's an amazing uplifting video of these two kids
3592720	3595920	who were handing out opt-out flyers at an airport.
3595920	3598920	And it's like a, it's not a short attention span thing.
3598920	3601120	Like it's like a 40 minute video,
3601120	3603040	but you can like click through it.
3603040	3607080	Like the, it's just these two kids are at an airport
3607080	3608960	and they're standing at the top of the escalators
3608960	3612000	in the public area before you go through the machines.
3612000	3614640	And they're handing out flyers to raise awareness
3614640	3616880	of like opt-out day or something like that.
3616880	3618320	Like you don't have to go through these machines
3618320	3619400	if you don't want to.
3619400	3622680	And the airport officials come up to them,
3622680	3625520	they're videotaping it and they start trying to bounce them
3625520	3627360	and like they're using all the official language
3627360	3629400	and you can't be here, you can't be doing this,
3629400	3631080	you can't be distributing this literature.
3631080	3634960	And they bother to say, I think we can.
3634960	3637440	I think we can stand here and talk to people
3637440	3638360	and hand them literature.
3638360	3639520	We're in an airport.
3639520	3641600	You have people down there doing the same thing
3641600	3642720	for some religion.
3642720	3644160	We're just doing the same thing.
3644160	3646440	And then they get increasingly aggressive
3646440	3648960	and then they call the cops and this cop,
3648960	3652000	not an airport cop, just a regular cop has to come.
3652000	3655640	And the regular cop is just this guy who refreshingly,
3655640	3658400	like he's kind of, he's got the buzz cut and the gun belt
3658400	3659800	and he just looks like any other cop
3659800	3661400	that might do any horrible thing.
3661400	3663520	But he like kind of scratches his head
3663520	3665560	and he walks away with the airport guy
3665560	3667600	and he's like comes back to the people and he's like,
3667600	3670360	yeah, I don't, I think the constitution says
3670360	3672280	you can do whatever you want.
3673280	3674120	I'm just saying.
3674120	3677080	He just printed out a copy and he was like, oh, oh God.
3677080	3678760	They gave me a gun and a walkie talkie.
3678760	3679960	I'm supposed to, I think I'm supposed
3679960	3681240	to just keep people safe.
3681240	3683720	I don't think I'm supposed to, I think you're,
3683720	3685680	I think you have to, and the airport guy is like,
3685680	3686920	what the fuck, what's your fucking name?
3686920	3689200	I'm an airport guy, I'm an airport guy.
3689200	3691960	The same as when you try to return a sweater
3691960	3695040	at Urban Outfitters, it's identical.
3695040	3697760	And I'm saying this, I feel strongly about this
3697760	3701040	because I worked at Urban Outfitters and at Hot Topic.
3702040	3704960	Yeah, yeah, really, dark times.
3704960	3707480	But at Hot Topic, the clothes are so cheap
3707480	3709520	and I would have colleagues that would be like,
3709520	3712360	I don't know, should we take this back?
3712360	3713560	Should we accept it?
3713560	3714800	And I'm like, yeah, what?
3714800	3717400	We make $7 an hour.
3717400	3718240	What does this matter?
3718240	3719200	It doesn't matter.
3719200	3720520	Sorry, I'm all fired up.
3720520	3722000	I don't know why I'm so fired up.
3722000	3723280	Well, it's the echoey chamber.
3723280	3724440	It makes you feel like you're in church.
3724440	3726440	It's that machine.
3726440	3727360	It's that machining back.
3727360	3728680	It just makes you think of Flashdance
3728680	3731160	and how women have been exploited by disco movies.
3735400	3737160	Let's find the pain in the room.
3737160	3739240	In our new segment, let's find the pain.
3740880	3742320	Who's in pain?
3742320	3743600	Emotional pain.
3743600	3745760	Your hand went up immediately.
3745760	3747120	Do you mind talking about it?
3747120	3747960	What's your name?
3747960	3748800	Seth.
3748800	3752000	Seth, what's your emotional pain?
3752000	3754480	Kind of lost all my best friends at once.
3754480	3756960	You lost all your best friends at once?
3756960	3758920	Are you willing to come up and talk about it?
3758920	3760240	OK, Seth, everybody.
3760240	3761080	Oh, OK.
3761080	3764080	Yeah, yeah, go that way.
3769080	3770960	Do we have extra mics?
3770960	3771800	He can share.
3771800	3772720	He can share my mic.
3772720	3775640	All right.
3775640	3776160	We can share.
3776160	3777720	It's Portland.
3777720	3779040	OK.
3779040	3780360	Here, Seth, you sit there.
3780360	3785640	I'm not going to be the, I'm going to lure it over you guys.
3785640	3787120	All right.
3787120	3790920	So you lost all your best friends in a short period of time?
3790920	3792680	Yeah, in like a weekend.
3792680	3793400	What'd you say?
3793400	3794160	In like a weekend.
3794160	3795840	OK, so take it from.
3795840	3798920	Was alcohol involved?
3798920	3800920	That's a good question.
3800920	3803960	Yeah, yeah, in some semblance, but not for the actual thing.
3803960	3804960	Sure.
3804960	3807960	Was it a wedding or a murder?
3807960	3809240	We could speculate all night.
3809240	3811000	It was a murder at a wedding, in fact.
3811000	3811760	It was a wedding?
3811760	3812920	It was a wedding murder.
3812920	3814240	It was a themed wedding.
3814240	3815440	It went poorly.
3816440	3818880	Was it a, OK.
3818880	3819880	Sorry, I'm sorry.
3819880	3820880	I'm murdering birds.
3820880	3823880	For the next two hours, you're like, did birds attack you?
3823880	3826200	We'll figure it out eventually.
3826200	3827640	Let's get there.
3827640	3830280	So I recently, like back in December,
3830280	3833960	moved from my hometown of Anchorage, Alaska,
3833960	3836920	down to Seattle, which is where I live now,
3836920	3839080	which is really far.
3839080	3842560	So you're following a hipster ley line.
3842560	3845480	You're going to end up living at Stonehenge.
3845480	3847880	You moved from Anchorage to Seattle to Portland.
3847880	3848800	He's going to, OK.
3848800	3852120	Are you afraid of people without tattoos?
3852120	3854040	No.
3854040	3855320	No, no, I'm sorry.
3855320	3856720	I love tattoos.
3856720	3858880	I just know that Anchorage and Seattle and Portland
3858880	3860840	all are famous for their beautiful tattoos.
3860840	3862520	And go ahead.
3862520	3864240	Yeah.
3864240	3867640	My only thing is I have a beard and have for some time.
3867640	3869240	You sure do.
3869240	3870600	But it's utilitarian.
3870680	3872680	This is a guy, sorry to interrupt,
3872680	3876800	but if Spencer's a brownie, this guy's a blondie.
3876800	3879840	He's a Spencer type for the podcast listeners.
3879840	3880320	For sure.
3880320	3881360	And that's hair color.
3881360	3883800	It's opposite coloring and looks the same.
3883800	3885160	He's a blond Spencer.
3885160	3886880	OK, continue.
3886880	3887720	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3887720	3889960	So I moved the beard utilitarian.
3889960	3890480	It was cold.
3890480	3890760	It was cold.
3890760	3892760	What's utilitarian about the beard?
3892760	3896760	It's really cold there, because Alaska.
3896760	3899240	I was in my hotel that's also as cold as Alaska.
3899240	3902200	And I was shirtless.
3902200	3903920	And I was trying to sleep.
3903920	3907360	And when I had my beard on my chest, I was fine.
3907360	3910880	And when I swept it to the side, I was freezing cold.
3910880	3912320	It's like an afghan for your neck.
3912320	3912920	It's wonderful.
3912920	3915840	It's like a blanket from your face.
3915840	3918440	And I heard the people in Ferguson are reporting
3918440	3920000	it's a natural tear gas filter.
3920000	3920760	Oh, definitely.
3920760	3925080	You just put it over your eyes like that.
3925080	3925640	It works.
3925640	3926680	It's just an adaptation.
3926680	3928280	We're all making it.
3928600	3931280	Anyway, I'll make this super brief.
3931280	3932360	You don't have to make it brief.
3932360	3933360	Yeah, don't worry about it.
3933360	3934600	We've got to leave room for the goose.
3934600	3935640	Go faster.
3935640	3937000	This isn't Desperate Housewives.
3937000	3940520	It's a fucking Portlandia podcast.
3940520	3942440	We want to hear your human stories.
3942440	3944520	I moved and had some really close friends
3944520	3945880	who I did podcasts with.
3945880	3948720	And we made a lot of stuff together.
3948720	3951360	And we were continuing to do it kind of long distance.
3951360	3952640	You did the journey with O'Hare.
3952640	3955080	Because I was the only one who moved, because I had to get out.
3955080	3956760	Because it's the middle of nowhere.
3956760	3957920	Yeah.
3958240	3958840	Alaska.
3958840	3962240	It's Cincinnati in the north.
3962240	3963520	No offense to Cincinnati.
3963520	3964560	They make wonderful chili.
3967320	3970560	So I moved and then came back in May,
3970560	3973400	like six months later for the first time, just for a weekend.
3973400	3974320	And we hung out.
3974320	3975480	And everything was great.
3975480	3977400	And then there was huge social drama,
3977400	3982520	because it turned out I had a, Anchorage is a small town.
3982520	3983200	I had had a.
3983200	3986080	You had thrown your anchor into a sea?
3986880	3990720	I found Anchorage, I guess you could say,
3990720	3993800	in a port that ended up being, oh, that's
3993800	3996040	a really bad way to talk about a human being.
3996040	3998520	I'm taking that back immediately.
3998520	4001960	I feel like we should commit to the punch.
4001960	4004480	We all know women are at ports.
4004480	4005920	We've hit like a major plot point.
4005920	4008720	And then you guys got derailed with this horrible word game.
4008720	4010800	It was a short term mortgage.
4010800	4014080	And then, but it was very friendly
4014080	4015520	and was very amicable.
4016160	4017120	And we were friends.
4017120	4021760	And then she started dating another friend
4021760	4023200	in the close friend group.
4023200	4025600	And things kind of spiraled from there.
4025600	4028120	But it was the first time that like really close friends
4028120	4031120	were kind of like, all right, no, we're done-zo, because.
4031120	4034840	Did you become the, this is the thing that drives me insane
4034840	4037440	about romance, the dark underbelly of it,
4037440	4041200	that we see, this is why I don't like romantic comedies,
4041200	4043520	but because Aaron loves them.
4043520	4048520	But I'm projecting like, the thing that drives me insane,
4048760	4051000	my worst nightmare is being cast as the villain
4051000	4053600	in someone else's story, even though I didn't,
4053600	4055520	it's just like, oh, that's convenient for you.
4055520	4057480	Like I'm the wind beneath your fucking wings
4057480	4060400	because it's like taboo.
4060400	4061640	And not only was I the villain,
4061640	4065280	I was Sauron on the proverbial mountain,
4065280	4067480	literally a country away.
4067480	4069320	You know, like you had to go through Canada,
4069320	4070760	which is like, I don't know,
4070760	4071840	dwarves live there or something.
4071840	4075360	And then there was me, you know, being all villainy.
4075360	4076480	So you became a-
4076480	4078480	Were you the other man ever?
4078480	4079320	No, not at all.
4079320	4080320	This was before they got together.
4080320	4081160	But there were-
4081160	4082000	Fuck those friends.
4082000	4082840	Yeah, yeah.
4082840	4083880	No one thinks about Alaska anyway.
4083880	4086480	For like, and it's not too big a deal,
4086480	4087600	because yeah, I don't need to go back.
4087600	4089200	I'm good for now.
4089200	4091480	Well, you said you're in emotional pain.
4091480	4093760	You lost all your friends in a couple of days.
4093760	4096640	Like you went from five to zero or whatever it is.
4096640	4098320	I don't mean to presume the numbers.
4099320	4100720	I would start with three.
4102080	4107080	But like, he needs to hear more than fuck those friends.
4107280	4108120	You're right.
4108120	4110440	My mom always used to say when I would go out
4110440	4113080	and I would get beat up by people,
4113080	4115320	and then I would come home and I would go,
4115320	4117040	Scott and so and so beat me up.
4117040	4118120	And my mom would go, well,
4118120	4120520	then now you know you don't like those guys, right?
4120520	4123080	You know, like, and here they are wanting to beat you up.
4123080	4124520	So some problems solve themselves.
4124520	4126240	And you have to see them every day.
4126240	4129080	And like, and that's the part that's still raw
4129080	4130680	is because of the internet,
4130720	4133320	which is a great thing in so many ways.
4133320	4138080	We're just kind of one Kevin Bacon away from each other.
4138080	4138920	Yeah.
4138920	4140600	And have a whole bunch of mutual friends.
4140600	4142880	So like, it's, there's only so much hiding
4142880	4144800	and blocking and muting that you can do.
4144800	4147280	Did they break up with you via like an email
4147280	4148680	or some kind of conversation?
4148680	4152040	No, it was like, hey, I'm back in town for three days.
4152040	4153480	Everything's cool one day, the next day.
4153480	4157240	Oh, by the way, podcast listeners.
4157240	4158080	It was great.
4158080	4158920	He's flipping up.
4158920	4162760	Give him double birds without really knowing the situation.
4162760	4165920	I would, I would say to not really take that too personally.
4165920	4168240	If you really believe that you weren't in the wrong.
4168240	4169320	Yeah, don't worry about it.
4169320	4170400	You've moved.
4170400	4173320	So it's not really about you.
4173320	4175120	It's like, they're, they're like, look,
4175120	4176880	who's in the Anchorage crew?
4176880	4178440	Well, it sounds like they're resentful
4178440	4179720	that you got out, right?
4179720	4183600	I mean, I'd imagine that it sucks to live there.
4183600	4184440	All that.
4184440	4186080	I mean, am I hearing a different thing?
4186080	4188160	I mean, he doesn't, he's not, he's not wondering
4188160	4189920	whether or not he should like these people.
4189920	4194240	He is saying it hurt, you know, it like is a wound
4194240	4196520	that wasn't, and it's just sitting there.
4196520	4199120	So what's the salve that you put on it?
4199120	4200080	It won't heal it.
4200080	4202840	The thing that'll heal it is his own body and time,
4202840	4205760	but is there like some, some Neosporin
4205760	4208520	that we could squirt on it in the form of a,
4208520	4210440	reminding myself, if I was in his position,
4210440	4212400	reminding myself that it wasn't really about me,
4212400	4215000	it would be that Neosporin, which is why I said that.
4215000	4215840	Right. Definitely.
4215840	4217720	I wasn't, and I, oh my God, I wasn't arguing with you.
4218320	4219160	Oh, Jesus.
4219160	4221680	You guys shouldn't be therapists at all.
4221680	4223520	If there's a couple therapists important.
4223520	4224760	Stand by opening up our own practice.
4224760	4226160	It's called mix nuts.
4227240	4228840	I mean, I think the first thing we need to do,
4228840	4230480	not to be Geraldo Rivera about it,
4230480	4233280	but I got to reach around him like Kelly McGillis
4233280	4236160	and Top Gun and just embrace him.
4236160	4237880	And you can't see it on the podcast.
4237880	4241840	It's not, it's not for, it's not for applause, but thank you.
4241840	4244440	How does it feel to be, to be touched and held
4244440	4246840	by someone you admire who will never betray you?
4247720	4251800	I don't care.
4251800	4255080	I don't care who you, who you date next.
4255080	4256600	I'm never going to touch her.
4260600	4263160	Every time you hear my voice, I'm talking to you.
4263160	4264760	Praise Jesus.
4265920	4268520	I'm very sorry that happened to you.
4268520	4271720	And these moments of pain, I like to quote,
4271720	4274520	one of my favorite shows of all time, my so-called life.
4275360	4278760	I would have referenced an episode halfway
4278760	4283760	through the series where Claire is getting over Jordan
4284080	4286320	and realizes that she's over him.
4286320	4288120	And she says, you know what?
4288120	4290000	It hurts until it doesn't.
4291080	4295040	It hurts until it doesn't.
4295040	4297280	That's still, that just seems like such a fuck off.
4297280	4298280	It hurts.
4298280	4299520	No, it's not, it's not a fuck off.
4299520	4301840	I mean, the meaning behind that is like, no,
4301840	4304360	like if you feel sad about this, your feelings are valid
4304360	4305640	and you're going to sit in them, but you won't feel
4305640	4306480	that way forever.
4306480	4307880	It'll, it'll expire.
4307880	4312000	It hurts until it doesn't.
4312000	4313920	What if it hurts forever?
4313920	4315080	Well, then there's something wrong with you
4315080	4315920	and you should jump off of it.
4315920	4318080	Then you die and it doesn't hurt anymore.
4318080	4319760	What if you know that about pain?
4319760	4321080	That makes me feel a lot better.
4321080	4322800	You just die and you're fine.
4322800	4324800	What if you're so smart?
4324800	4325640	What if you're so smart?
4325640	4327960	If it hurts forever, then it's not about that situation.
4327960	4330720	What if you're so smart that you know that about pain
4330720	4332160	and it doesn't change anything?
4332160	4334960	What if, what if, what if, what do you do in those moments
4334960	4338720	when knowing how your brain works and how your heart works
4338720	4340680	doesn't change anything that's going on in them?
4340680	4342880	What are you, what are you, is there, is there a technique?
4342880	4344320	Is there a, you know.
4344320	4345520	You go inside.
4345520	4347080	You gotta, you gotta go inside.
4347080	4347920	Get out of the sun.
4347920	4350320	Get out of the fucking orange Hitler that is the sun.
4350320	4351840	Your emotions are a lot like weather.
4351840	4353960	They come and go and sometimes they make sense
4353960	4354800	and follow patterns.
4354800	4356920	And other times it's like a freak storm.
4356920	4358720	It's like you go inside or you.
4358720	4362000	I had a friend who suggested he got over a breakup
4362160	4364480	and he watched all the seasons of Farscape.
4364480	4365880	Oh, that sounds awesome.
4365880	4368040	I mean, the thing is it's, it's not a,
4368040	4371200	that's the thing is that like it's, it's a tired expression,
4371200	4373680	but it's in a dumb old adage,
4373680	4377160	but time really does heal all wounds.
4377160	4380440	The good news about being sad is that in times
4380440	4382360	when you're sad, art is better.
4382360	4383880	Music is better.
4383880	4385080	You're probably more creative.
4385080	4386720	You're seeing things differently.
4386720	4389080	Like you're really living because you have, you're,
4389080	4391960	you're bleeding from your soul as you're walking around.
4391960	4393520	Like that's the good news.
4393520	4395400	The bad news is again, it's gonna feel bad
4395400	4397080	until it doesn't feel bad anymore.
4397080	4398920	That's just, that's just time.
4398920	4403000	The bad thing to do is to try to fix it by fucking,
4403000	4405480	you know, doing like putting up,
4405480	4408800	building a windmill or whatever crazy thing you would do.
4408800	4411000	Talking about it on a podcast in front of.
4411000	4413160	Yeah, well, I don't, I don't think Seth's the type of guy
4413160	4414000	that's going to do anything.
4414000	4415480	He's going to, I mean, by the way,
4415480	4416320	Wait, what?
4416320	4418200	He's going to do great things.
4418200	4421800	No, I was saying, I don't think he's going to do anything
4421960	4423440	that's like unhealthy with his pain.
4423440	4425400	If he's willing to like cry it out
4425400	4426760	from an audience at a podcast,
4426760	4428840	then that means he's already actually like,
4428840	4431360	he's got oxygen and that's going to heal.
4431360	4435000	But Seth, do you, do you ever listen to this podcast?
4435000	4437080	Do you think it would help you heal a little bit
4437080	4438480	to play a character that you,
4438480	4441280	whose life you had more control over
4441280	4443520	in a game of Dungeons and Dragons, maybe,
4443520	4446080	whose wounds could not hurt you
4446080	4449320	no matter who did anything to you?
4449320	4452120	So do you think, I don't know how,
4452120	4454520	we got a smattering of applause
4454520	4457160	when we asked who listened to the podcast.
4457160	4458400	But the thing is during the podcast,
4458400	4462200	we ended by playing a round of Dungeons and Dragons
4463520	4464360	on the podcast.
4464360	4469040	So I guess if you're not a fan, fuck off, I guess,
4469040	4473120	but not in a mean way, Justin,
4473120	4475240	you won't maybe not know what's going on.
4475240	4476680	Or if you're a gaming fan,
4476680	4481680	I mean, this is a big like tabletop intensive conference.
4481680	4482520	So we're going to be,
4482520	4485640	we have an ongoing campaign that we play
4485640	4488680	and we need a Christa Berg who will be Seth
4488680	4491800	and we need a, if McKenna would be willing to be,
4491800	4493280	wait, so we have,
4493280	4495400	well, I'm sorry, we need a Quark
4495400	4499480	and you'll play Christa Berg, sorry, McKenna.
4499480	4502880	Okay, you get the character sheets, Spencer?
4502880	4505240	Yeah, let me just bust these out real quick.
4505240	4507320	All right, while he's busting those out,
4507320	4509360	keep being comedic.
4509360	4511480	Erin, did you want to read the list of,
4512480	4513620	Oh, sure.
4514560	4515920	I mean, this is just a shout out to her.
4515920	4517560	Do you guys know who Rob Shravaves,
4517560	4521440	he's somebody who's on the podcast?
4521440	4523040	That's eight people.
4523040	4525040	Do you have your, do you have the list on?
4525040	4527400	Yeah, maybe, I'm looking ahead and I'm going like,
4527400	4528840	you know what, it's not the venue.
4528840	4532760	We also have Dustin Marshall's technology corner.
4533400	4534880	Dustin explained to us earlier
4534880	4537660	that if you pay attention to the size of cell phones,
4538520	4541920	it appears that their size changes over time
4541920	4543280	based on people's needs
4543280	4545400	and that that's similar to evolution
4545400	4549320	and we started mocking him for that revelation.
4549320	4551120	If you need a time filler, I can pull out my phone.
4551120	4553640	I have this great treatment for Alan Alda.
4553640	4554480	It plays a...
4554480	4558080	Wait, where is that guy?
4558080	4559320	Is that guy here?
4560280	4561920	Is the guy here that read the treatment?
4562160	4563200	There he is.
4563200	4566680	Are you, did I humiliate you?
4566680	4568880	Did I make you feel bad by telling that story?
4568880	4569720	Okay.
4569720	4572440	Do you want, can I turn it into a win for you?
4572440	4574840	Do you want to read your treatment to the people or?
4574840	4575680	Yeah.
4578840	4580640	Anything you want, like for real,
4580640	4585120	like I'm not bullying you, like I don't want,
4585120	4587200	if you're actually worried that you would read it
4587200	4589680	and then people would go, I'm gonna rip that off.
4589680	4591480	Or do you just want to talk about it for a second?
4592480	4593960	Okay, all right.
4593960	4596000	I just want to humanize you for them.
4597640	4599000	I don't want the moral of the story
4599000	4600360	to be that people are bad.
4600360	4603120	I want it to be that they're our heroes.
4603120	4603960	I love it.
4603960	4604800	What's your name?
4604800	4605640	Jason.
4605640	4606480	Jason, all right.
4606480	4608880	Jason's the guy who read me a treatment off his phone
4608880	4610320	at the cooler of us.
4610320	4611600	I was so annoyed and I felt so bad.
4611600	4612440	It's the weirdest thing I've ever done.
4612440	4613280	I wasn't that annoyed.
4613280	4615680	I just thought it was remarkable.
4615680	4618640	I actually canceled my D&D night tonight to be here.
4618640	4620680	Oh God, all right.
4620720	4622080	What do you play?
4622080	4623960	What do you play as in D&D?
4624960	4626800	I was a warlock for a while right now.
4626800	4628040	On the mic, on the mic.
4628040	4630400	Warlock for a while and right now I'm a paladin, so.
4630400	4631440	I gotcha.
4631440	4632480	That's exciting.
4632480	4634160	Gilman Neutronos.
4634160	4635800	Yeah, it's kind of getting old.
4635800	4637360	No, it sounds great.
4637360	4639080	David Cross is a family man.
4639080	4640760	Can we, let's reenact the encounter.
4640760	4642120	Oh yeah, okay, okay.
4642120	4644120	Imagine a black and white strobing thing
4644120	4645400	like from a crime show.
4645400	4646240	Yeah.
4646240	4648880	Like, okay, we're lookalike actors.
4648880	4651080	So, like, David Duke Company's playing me.
4651080	4654960	And so, I'm just, let's just reenact,
4654960	4656560	okay, I'm by the cooler, okay.
4656560	4658160	Dan, this is the only time this is gonna happen,
4658160	4659560	but I have to do it now.
4659560	4660440	Okay.
4660440	4663160	So, David Cross is a put-upon family man
4663160	4664160	and a super scientist.
4664160	4666440	He works at the Enlightenment Corporation
4666440	4668120	and tests the bodhisattva chair,
4668120	4669640	an electric chair that blasts people
4669640	4671200	into enlightenment for science.
4671200	4672880	Father of three, his wife, Jane,
4672880	4674080	keeps things kosher at home
4674080	4677040	while wielding a gigantic hook for a hand.
4677040	4678120	Doesn't sound that bad.
4678200	4679040	Sounds great.
4680040	4680880	That's okay.
4680880	4681760	All right, thank you, sir.
4681760	4682600	What's your name again?
4682600	4683840	Sorry, Jason, Jason, all right.
4683840	4687960	Jason, everybody, the David Cross treatment writer.
4687960	4688960	I know David Cross.
4688960	4690560	We'll get that to him.
4693320	4694880	But I don't think he makes those decisions.
4694880	4696360	I think David Cross probably has an agent
4696360	4697640	and he's like, does anyone wanna hire me?
4697640	4701600	And then they go like, oh, the guy wants you to play a robot.
4701600	4702440	All right.
4703480	4705280	So, you got the character sheets ready?
4705280	4708720	Yeah, let me just, let me give that to you.
4708720	4710120	Give that to Erin.
4712680	4715920	And then the top ones for McKenna and the rest is yours.
4716840	4718920	It's here for Spencer as camtroller.
4718920	4719760	I mean, let's not.
4719760	4720600	So great.
4720600	4721920	So great.
4721920	4723800	That's about what I deserve.
4723800	4726880	It's very apt, it's appropriate.
4726880	4727720	I appreciate that.
4727720	4728920	I said it, I said it quietly.
4728920	4729760	I mean, now it's getting.
4729760	4731120	He's killing it, he's killing it.
4731120	4732520	Now it's getting dishonest.
4732520	4734760	Now it's dishonest, I don't buy it.
4734880	4736240	I'm not buying it anymore.
4736240	4739040	It was a lot more believable before.
4739040	4741000	So thank you, that's what I'm looking for.
4741000	4742720	That's what I need right now.
4742720	4743640	Are you guys ready?
4743640	4745320	Should I start this up?
4745320	4746160	Yeah, let's do it.
4746160	4747560	I don't have my D&D music,
4747560	4750640	so I'm just gonna play that warm up music from earlier.
4750640	4751800	We can hum it.
4751800	4753160	Do you wanna hum it?
4753160	4755720	I think that would be better, actually.
4755720	4756560	Oh.
4759480	4762480	When we last met, our heroes had landed
4762480	4764640	in some pretty hot water.
4764640	4767560	After a late night juice tour gone awry,
4767560	4771400	the party retired with Spizbulb the friendly gnome,
4771400	4774560	where they decided to break into the priest's juicery
4774560	4776000	to look for clues.
4776000	4776840	Don't pick up.
4777800	4780480	While inside the juicery, the gang heard a noise
4780480	4783040	and arrived to see a beaten father tinder
4783040	4785040	and a escaping assailant.
4785040	4787440	Sharpie tracked down the would-be murderer
4787440	4791280	to the Darmvon household and what he found wasn't pretty.
4791280	4794480	Darmvon and her son were murdered.
4794480	4795320	Dead.
4797880	4800640	There, Sharpie and the gang encountered the assassin,
4800640	4802200	Spizbulb the gnome.
4802200	4804560	The little gnome cast powerful gnat magics
4804560	4808000	and hurled in souls, but something wasn't light, right?
4808000	4811480	Bone blows were exchanged, but using his shrewd mind,
4811480	4815360	Christopher determined that Spizbulb wasn't in posture,
4815360	4819360	convincing their attacker to cast off his disguise,
4819360	4821560	revealing himself to be none other
4821560	4823480	than Father Tinder himself.
4824320	4828600	Working together, the gang started to gain the upper hand,
4828600	4831480	breaking through his shield while Quark slashed Tinder's head
4831480	4833040	with a flaming sword.
4833040	4836920	As the old man light dying, white beams of light
4836920	4840080	began streaming through the room as the shard of power
4840080	4842680	worked its ancient and hideous magic.
4842680	4845440	But what danger could the shard portend?
4845440	4848000	What new evils must the gang face?
4848000	4851760	Here we come, here we come, here we come, here we come,
4851760	4853160	here we come, here we come.
4853160	4857080	What tricks were still hidden away up Father Tinder's sleeve?
4857080	4858720	Find out now.
4858720	4862760	The whole new Harman Town.
4862760	4863600	Oh.
4863600	4869160	That was some great humming.
4869160	4870520	I want to buy that album.
4870520	4872840	I assume the effect is the same as in the shower,
4872840	4875280	but it sounded awesome to me.
4875280	4876800	I think when we listen to the podcast,
4876800	4881520	we'll be like, oh my god, stop groaning into the microphone.
4881520	4883240	So traditionally, you guys have a lot
4883240	4885360	of questions at this point.
4885360	4886960	Well, I was humming.
4886960	4887960	Yeah, I wasn't listening.
4887960	4888880	I was humming.
4888880	4890200	That's what I'm saying.
4890200	4894040	So just in a moment, where am I standing?
4894040	4895720	You guys are all standing together
4895720	4898480	in the broken remnants of the Darmvon household.
4898480	4901240	You see crumbling stone falling from the ceiling,
4901240	4903760	and all the furniture in the room is destroyed,
4903760	4905880	reduced to splinters.
4905880	4909560	Everything is very hard to see because white light is
4909560	4912160	dazzling you, going throughout the room
4912160	4916200	before it concentrates onto a single glowing humanoid form,
4916200	4918240	the form of Father Tinder.
4918240	4922280	He starts to transform before you into an eight feet tall,
4922280	4926320	gray skinned, stone skinned, bullhorned man
4926320	4929840	with glowing red eyes, powerful muscular limbs,
4929840	4931920	and stony wings.
4931920	4935320	A burning white flame grows brightly in his chest,
4935320	4940680	and he looks not unlike a winged demon or something.
4940680	4941200	Hi.
4945200	4946280	Do you have more questions?
4946280	4948040	We're probably cool now, right, now
4948040	4950360	that he's transformed into this thing?
4950360	4952200	Are you asking me, or are you asking him?
4952200	4954040	I'm kind of thinking out loud.
4954040	4954800	OK.
4954800	4956120	Continue.
4956120	4960240	I've worked for him for many a moon and a sunset.
4960240	4965360	For a sunset, 20 moons.
4965360	4967360	Who are you?
4967360	4969360	I'm Father Tinder.
4969360	4974000	I have transformed into my final form.
4974000	4977000	Like that lady at the drive-thru in the video?
4977000	4979520	Yeah, but I'm getting all the chicken nuggets.
4983680	4985840	Now that you've transformed into your final form,
4985840	4988440	you're probably really self-actualized,
4988440	4991120	and all your aggression is gone, right?
4991120	4994440	You could say that, yes, but I'll still need to destroy you.
4997240	4999320	I mean, we could talk about that.
4999320	5002040	We could, while I'm destroying you.
5004680	5007080	All right, I'm going to run.
5007080	5009640	I'd like to run.
5009640	5013080	What do you guys, we're standing there,
5013080	5015680	and this guy turned into a demon, and he's going to kill us.
5015680	5016440	Do you guys have any?
5016440	5018720	He's a glowy white spot in the middle of his chest.
5018720	5021320	Yeah.
5021320	5023920	You know, this isn't my first rodeo with gamey things.
5023920	5026120	That's usually the place you want to throw a sword or something.
5026120	5027320	Oh, OK.
5027320	5027800	All right.
5027800	5029400	Well, I mean, this isn't my first rodeo,
5029400	5033800	but do you really want to throw your swords?
5033800	5036040	It's more of a Castlevania type.
5036040	5038400	You know, there's a lot of platformers from the old days.
5038400	5040400	Barbarian, not thinking things through very well.
5040400	5041840	It's good characterization.
5041840	5043880	All right, I'm bolstered by your confidence.
5043880	5046720	You think this is as easy as a boss battle in a video game?
5046720	5049120	Well, I'll attack his milky white spot.
5053920	5054840	All right.
5054840	5059000	I'm not a D&D player, but in my gear, I have a dragon dick.
5059000	5063760	So I feel like that might work in this situation.
5063760	5064920	It's more of a trophy.
5064920	5069320	I mean, I think I remember where you got that.
5069320	5071720	I don't know if it's a weapon.
5072520	5075720	It's a conversation piece.
5075720	5078240	Most things are a weapon against a milky white spot
5078240	5081600	and most of them have a chest.
5081600	5083160	Whose turn is it first, I guess?
5083160	5084720	I want to put it at a quark's turn.
5084720	5085240	How about?
5085240	5086600	That's Seth there.
5086600	5088000	Oh, Seth, OK.
5088000	5090000	Well, let's go ahead and use a power attack.
5090000	5091080	All right.
5091080	5094840	That's going to be less accurate than a normal attack, I'm afraid.
5094840	5095960	And yet you hit him.
5096760	5097260	Whoo!
5100260	5104000	Dropping anchor.
5104000	5106000	Rushing towards your demonic foe,
5106000	5112440	you plunge your sword deep into his side, dealing 12 damage.
5112440	5116440	And that's not even the milky white spot.
5116440	5118440	Sure.
5118440	5120160	I'm excited.
5120160	5121120	We're having a great time.
5121120	5122480	We can do this.
5122480	5123720	We are doing this.
5123720	5125720	Yeah, this is going really well.
5126480	5128600	No, I think so.
5128600	5130280	Well, it was.
5130280	5131920	Let's put it at McKenna's turn.
5131920	5134280	That's Christa Berg, right?
5134280	5135680	Yes.
5135680	5137160	Apparently it is.
5137160	5139760	So yeah, you got your dragon dick.
5139760	5141560	Let's do this.
5141560	5143040	Do this Sandin Street style.
5147880	5149320	Feel free to ask questions.
5152240	5154240	I may need some help on this.
5154600	5157600	I'm not going to lie.
5157600	5160880	Yeah, it occurs to me we're subjecting her to quite a lot.
5160880	5161800	Yeah, no.
5161800	5163040	You're telling me.
5163040	5165480	I don't know half of this.
5165480	5166000	All right.
5168640	5171960	I'm going to attempt to use a short bow.
5171960	5175560	No, McKenna, you're going to use the short bow.
5175560	5178120	I'm going to fucking shoot the short bow.
5178120	5181240	You're going to shoot that short bow.
5181240	5183720	I'm shooting it into the milky white spot.
5184160	5187000	Yes, she is.
5187000	5191680	Firing an arrow at his milky white spot.
5191680	5194320	It might have been your incong...
5194320	5195920	What is the lack of confidence?
5195920	5199080	Lack of confidence.
5199080	5199960	Or something.
5199960	5202640	But your arrow misses its mark, plunging deep
5202640	5205880	into the cobblestone walls of the dwelling.
5205880	5206840	It's OK.
5206840	5209680	He knows we mean business.
5209680	5211920	Communication shot.
5211920	5215320	So let's put it at a dignity.
5215320	5216760	That's Aaron.
5216760	5219080	All right.
5219080	5219600	Foe.
5224560	5225560	Yeah.
5225560	5231760	Unworthy foe who has been deceitful and untrue.
5231760	5235040	I'm going to throw my axe.
5235040	5236720	And it's going to be the death of you.
5236720	5237280	I rhyme now.
5237280	5237960	I guess I rhyme now.
5237960	5240520	So I'm going to throw my axe.
5240520	5242360	I'm going to throw it really hard
5242360	5246360	at the middle of his face.
5246360	5248160	You do that.
5248160	5250280	But it doesn't hit him in the middle of his face,
5250280	5252760	but instead in his shoulder.
5252760	5255320	Dealing.
5255320	5256320	What's your strength?
5256320	5258160	It's plus three.
5258160	5260880	Eight damage.
5260880	5262040	All right.
5262040	5263640	Yeah.
5263640	5265560	The axe protrudes from his shoulder.
5268760	5269600	It's not a joke.
5269600	5274080	I'd like to shoot a fireball at his milky white spot.
5274080	5274680	All right.
5274680	5276640	Casting your arms in a magical manner,
5276640	5280920	you unleash a fireball directly towards his milky white spot.
5280920	5284000	He attempts to dodge out of the way, but is too sluggish.
5284000	5285720	And it hits him right in the chest,
5285720	5287040	but not his milky white spot.
5287040	5290040	Like the nipple right next to it instead.
5290040	5293480	But a nice grouping, as they say in darts.
5293480	5296560	So very kinky to guarantee.
5296560	5300760	I guess there are dragon dicks and milky white semen,
5300760	5302000	all this stuff.
5302000	5305520	There was no semen, but now there is.
5305520	5308280	Portland, most strip clubs in the world, right?
5308280	5310080	Per capita?
5310080	5313120	Love hearing about it.
5313120	5314400	Most vegan strip clubs?
5314400	5315160	Is that what you said?
5319560	5320560	We'll talk after.
5320560	5322840	We'll figure it out.
5322840	5325600	Dealing 17 damage.
5325600	5326120	All right.
5327080	5329800	And that's just the nipple.
5329800	5334600	I shout out, the milky white spot, it's the way to go.
5334600	5337120	So he turns his eyes to you, the wizard who's
5337120	5338880	casted all this magic sand.
5338880	5342760	He beats his powerful wings and lunges at you through the air.
5342760	5345960	His claws outstretched, reaching right towards your neck.
5348560	5351720	That's my milky white spot.
5351720	5356040	He grabs you by the throat, dealing nine damage
5356040	5359840	and holding you fast in his sharp, rocky claw.
5359840	5360840	All right.
5360840	5364640	Is it possible for me to go out of turn and use diplomacy?
5364640	5366560	No, I'm afraid not.
5366560	5370240	But you could do it in your own turn.
5370240	5371040	Thank you.
5371040	5375240	Which is only three turns away, putting it at Seth's turn.
5381960	5383560	I appear to have some yarn.
5383560	5385360	You sure do.
5385480	5388720	A whole ball, if I'm not mistaken.
5388720	5389920	I just thought it was funny because it's
5389920	5392640	right next to the nut sack.
5392640	5394360	I thought he got rid of that nut sack.
5394360	5396520	It is not yet been erased.
5396520	5400360	You should combine it with the dragon dick.
5400360	5402640	Let's try to take a moment and see how much joy it
5402640	5407680	is for me to hear that Quark is about to use yarn.
5407680	5409160	It's a very happy moment.
5409160	5411800	Actually, I also have, what's a cactus card?
5411800	5415120	That's like a business card that says cactus club or bunch.
5416080	5417400	Oh, right, right, right.
5417400	5418600	Buy one, get one free.
5418600	5420000	And also a strange painted stick.
5420000	5421560	Is there any more information about that at all?
5421560	5423520	It's strangely painted in a stick.
5427960	5428480	So no.
5435200	5437680	So that I did not hit my compatriot who
5437680	5441000	is being held by the demon, correct?
5441000	5442360	I mean, what are you trying to do?
5442360	5446840	I'm trying to attack, but not cleave someone in half
5446840	5449080	who isn't a white spot guy.
5449080	5454120	Taking careful attention not to hurt your ally,
5454120	5457680	you slice with your sword at the demonic foe before you.
5457680	5459480	I got a hug.
5459480	5463080	But you were too considerate, and you go way wide
5463080	5466000	and don't hit anything at all.
5466000	5468040	Just some advice, it hurts until it doesn't.
5473240	5477320	I knew that wouldn't be helpful.
5477320	5480280	So let's put it at a Christoper experiment.
5483960	5486360	A post it tells me I have a robot baby, is that right?
5486360	5488680	Oh, yeah.
5488680	5491000	Is there any use to the robot baby?
5491000	5492640	I mean, there's tons of uses.
5492640	5494960	I don't think you know any of them.
5494960	5495560	Probably not.
5495560	5497640	It's heavy, you could hit someone with it maybe,
5497640	5500360	or you could tell it something.
5500360	5501120	Give it a command.
5501120	5504280	Give the robot baby a command.
5504280	5505400	What was that?
5505400	5507560	Tell the robot baby, give it a command.
5507560	5508200	Maybe it'll.
5508200	5509200	Oh.
5509200	5515440	So if I tell the robot baby to infiltrate the milky white
5515440	5523400	spot and retrieve whatever's inside, I can attempt that.
5523400	5523880	You can't?
5523880	5525520	Yeah, definitely.
5525520	5527040	I'm going to do that.
5527040	5527920	All right, say it.
5527920	5529320	Say it to the baby.
5529320	5532960	Baby, go to the milky white spot.
5532960	5534360	Like you mean it, McKenna.
5534360	5536920	Yes, go inside of it.
5536920	5539280	Like you know the baby's going to do it.
5539280	5544000	Take hold of the milky white spot and bring it to me.
5548880	5555000	You say those things and the robot baby's like, all right.
5555000	5559120	He starts waddling over towards the giant demon thing.
5560080	5562000	He's getting over there.
5562000	5563680	The demon doesn't seem too occupied,
5563680	5565120	probably because it's a robot baby.
5565120	5566840	And he starts climbing up his leg,
5566840	5569240	but it's going to take some time before he can actually
5569240	5572240	infiltrate the milky white spot.
5572240	5575280	For some reason, he doesn't seem to notice the robot baby.
5575280	5578720	It's a weird phenomenon.
5578720	5581720	OK, so then because I know the robot baby is approaching
5581720	5586120	the milky white spot, I use diplomacy.
5586120	5590240	And I look at Father Tinder and say, Father Tinder.
5594120	5594640	Uh-huh.
5594640	5595360	Can we?
5595360	5597080	Sorry, I was hearing echoes.
5597080	5598560	It's just the sounds of Portland.
5598560	5600000	There's trains.
5600000	5602280	There's 5,000 people outside.
5602280	5605320	I thought I was hearing my demons for a second.
5605320	5609840	Father Tinder, one moment.
5609840	5612680	Can you just look at my face for a second,
5612680	5618120	because I'm going to explain to you why
5618120	5620080	you are such a great leader.
5620080	5624080	But I'm using my diplomacy, which is basically hypnosis.
5624080	5625240	Yes, I'm lying, yes.
5625240	5627040	You can't use diplomacy for lying.
5627040	5627560	Oh, I can't?
5627560	5628280	OK, thank you.
5628280	5628880	OK.
5628880	5633560	Father Tinder, you look like a piece of shit.
5633560	5637640	Father Tinder, this final thing that you've turned into
5637640	5638520	is no good.
5638520	5639720	No one likes it.
5639720	5640840	You have no friends.
5640840	5642320	You're going to defeat us, and then
5642440	5644280	you're going to be all alone.
5644280	5651080	So stay still for a moment, because I want you to.
5651080	5654440	I really want you to stay still.
5654440	5659640	It's my heart's desire that you do not look anywhere
5659640	5661880	but into my eyes.
5661880	5664520	He glares at you with his red eyes,
5664520	5667800	and he looks like he's looking directly through you
5667800	5669000	and through your soul.
5669000	5671160	And he's like, I don't know what you're getting at,
5671160	5673080	but I feel like I'm trying to, or I
5673080	5675400	feel like I'm being manipulated here.
5675400	5676560	I'm not going to do that.
5676560	5679800	I'm going to start looking around continuously
5679800	5683720	for the rest of the turn.
5683720	5685360	What's the status on the baby?
5685360	5687040	The baby's still working around.
5687040	5690440	He's, you know, he's met the resistance.
5690440	5694040	The baby's headed through the resistance.
5694040	5696720	Someone said, someone in the audience said that.
5696720	5699200	That was my turn, right?
5699200	5700840	I mean, you could do a short action,
5700840	5702520	because you only said some words.
5702520	5709200	OK, so I take a sword, and I try to stab his foot
5709200	5711160	so I peg him to the ground.
5711160	5712200	All right.
5712200	5715880	Like a taxidermy, like I'm off.
5715880	5719640	You stab at his foot, and it doesn't pin him to the ground,
5719640	5721040	but it does hurt him somewhat.
5721040	5722800	Would you stab him with a sword?
5722800	5724200	I did, I stabbed him with a sword.
5724200	5725280	Those are sharp.
5725280	5728400	It deals 11 damage to his foot.
5728400	5730960	All right.
5730960	5731600	That's good.
5731600	5733680	I clap my hands like I've finished a job,
5733680	5736040	and I spit on the ground and twirl.
5736040	5737040	Like Mighty Mouse.
5737040	5738760	That might do the dust off your hands.
5738760	5740680	Yeah, exactly.
5740680	5742520	Is that actually happening?
5742520	5743720	Yeah, that happens.
5743720	5745720	OK, just making sure.
5745720	5746560	Yeah.
5746560	5747080	All right.
5747080	5749720	And then I say, let's all journey towards truth.
5749720	5752920	And then I sit down on the ground,
5752920	5755680	and I regret everything I just did.
5755680	5758240	Putting it at Sharpie's turn.
5758240	5761240	All right, Lightning Bolt at the Milky White Spot.
5761240	5763600	It's not the first time I've said it.
5763600	5766720	I feel like, OK, I'm going to say
5766720	5769560	that after this, you're out of spells of the third level,
5769560	5770800	because that sounds like all of them.
5770800	5772000	You're cutting me off?
5772000	5774480	Well, yeah.
5774480	5775880	You only have so many.
5775880	5776760	I mean, that's how it works.
5776760	5779200	When's the last time you heard me cast a Lightning Bolt?
5779200	5781920	You've only, you've cast three level, this is exciting.
5781920	5783960	You've cast three level three spells in the last five days.
5783960	5787680	I can quit any time I want.
5787760	5790720	I don't have a problem.
5790720	5792840	You cast your arms in a magical manner
5792840	5795040	and pointing your lightning finger towards them.
5795040	5798920	You unleash a torrent, a bolt, a bolt of lightning,
5798920	5800040	a bolt of lightning.
5800040	5803200	But because he's not heeding Dignity's advice
5803200	5806760	and looking all around, he finds it very easy to see it coming,
5806760	5808200	and he dodges out of the way.
5808200	5810240	That dumb.
5810240	5812320	I mean, I don't want to tell you your job.
5812320	5815040	I could explain it in a different way if you'd prefer.
5815040	5815960	No, you roll.
5815960	5819880	You just did such a shitty job that he dodged his out of the way.
5819880	5821280	Yeah.
5821280	5822760	You're a terrible wizard.
5822760	5825680	You're a bad friend.
5825680	5828480	It's going to hurt until it doesn't.
5828480	5831360	It's going to hurt until it doesn't.
5831360	5836200	So a father-tender demon guy, he's still not
5836200	5839560	noticing this baby for whatever reason.
5839560	5842680	Maybe it's his stony skin makes him impervious, tall,
5842680	5844200	but the heaviest of touches.
5845160	5848440	He starts squeezing on Sharpie.
5848440	5850640	He starts squeezing on Sharpie harder.
5850640	5852920	Jesus Christ.
5852920	5854040	He fails at that, though.
5854040	5858440	It's like a neck massage or something.
5858440	5860800	I don't want to be one of those characters in the movie that
5860800	5865440	says a little help, but I'm not going to do that.
5865440	5867400	I'm not going to do that.
5867400	5868560	Wait, did you just do that?
5868560	5869400	No, no.
5869400	5870280	That's metagaming.
5870280	5872640	I'm just saying I'm not doing that.
5872640	5875920	I'm not going to be hack and say, little help.
5875920	5877040	I'm getting choked.
5877040	5880680	So let's put it at Seth's turn.
5880680	5882720	Sorry, who?
5882720	5884520	Your name's Seth, right?
5884520	5889160	I mean, I'm a gnome barbarian by the name of Quatt.
5889160	5890760	I'm just trying to be friends with you.
5890760	5891480	No, it's all right.
5891480	5894040	And you know, I've created this artificial barrier.
5894040	5895560	It's a defense mechanism.
5895560	5896520	I think we all do.
5896520	5900200	Anyway, I'm going to use my armulet of winter
5900200	5902360	and call a sleet storm to try and obstruct
5902360	5909080	the view of evil Dr. Tinder, or Mr. Father Tinder,
5909080	5910320	so he can't see the baby.
5910320	5912200	Dr. Tinder's pretty good.
5912200	5915200	That's going to be my next sitcom.
5915200	5919240	So you activate holding your armulet of winter to the sky.
5919240	5920280	You activate it.
5920280	5923600	And driving winds and cold sleet?
5923600	5924400	Sleet, you said.
5924400	5929920	Sleet falls out of the sky and through the broken cracks
5929960	5931120	in the ceiling.
5931120	5934440	It's all making everything cold and slippery and hard to walk.
5934440	5936200	And he's getting coated in rhyme.
5936200	5937560	And it's getting in his eyes.
5937560	5941000	And it's all kinds of trouble.
5941000	5943200	He doesn't take any damage, but he
5943200	5948880	seems to be blinded or at least visually impaired.
5948880	5949600	That's good.
5949600	5950120	It's great.
5950120	5951040	That's great, yeah.
5951040	5954960	It's one of the, yeah, it's amazing.
5954960	5956080	I mean, it is.
5956080	5957040	It's great.
5957040	5960120	Let's put it on the cast turn, though.
5960120	5962200	Who is Krista Berg?
5962200	5965920	I'm going to add to the sleet storm
5965920	5972080	and use my weapon of sap to coat the snow that
5972080	5975040	is falling on his face.
5975040	5977640	I love this idea, but a sap is actually
5977640	5980400	like a beanbag full of quarters that you
5980400	5982960	hit someone with in the face.
5982960	5984760	Can that coat?
5984760	5987000	It can coat, right?
5987000	5988120	You could empty it out.
5988120	5989880	And like, yeah, yeah, it's like a beanbag.
5989880	5991560	You could cut it open and coat someone.
5991560	5992680	I'm going to cut it open.
5992680	5996440	And the insides are going to coat into the ice.
5996440	5997080	Yeah.
5997080	5998600	And further.
5998600	6000280	Yeah, I can get behind that.
6000280	6004320	It's going to block the view, yes.
6004320	6006000	With a death flick of your wrist,
6006000	6009720	you slice a small incision in your sap
6009720	6014040	and lead dust sprinkles out, being taken up by the icy winds
6014040	6017480	and gets stuck in this guy's eyes harder.
6017480	6019760	He's getting, he's completely blind.
6019760	6023440	If there was any ever any sight he's had, it's gone now.
6023440	6024440	All right.
6024440	6025800	All right.
6025800	6028200	Let's just keep, I get out a bucket of confetti
6028200	6031600	and I'm just like, hey.
6031600	6035520	We just keep blinding him until he gives up.
6035520	6036920	Which blind people should never do.
6036920	6039080	The baby's still crawling, right?
6039080	6039800	Yeah.
6039800	6040880	The baby's still working.
6040880	6043600	Since it's after your turn, the baby,
6044360	6045680	he's reaching in there.
6045680	6046680	He's reaching in the milky.
6046680	6048720	Yeah, so the baby is at the milky white spot,
6048720	6052480	like around the rim of the milky white spot?
6052480	6055280	He's situated about it.
6055280	6057680	He's reaching in there with his little robot arm
6057680	6060640	and he can't fit his whole body in there,
6060640	6063560	but he's really going for it.
6063560	6065240	He's got a lot of gumption.
6065240	6066400	I love it.
6066400	6068640	Let's put it at a dignity.
6068640	6078200	I take out my lance and I charge towards Father Tinder
6078200	6081920	and I aim directly between his eyes,
6081920	6083440	which I know I've done before, but now it's
6083440	6086400	with a different weapon.
6086400	6088320	You're right, come.
6088320	6091240	Good over evil.
6091240	6094640	All praise, Sistresha.
6094640	6096640	Sistresha.
6096640	6099920	Because he's blind, you charge directly into him
6099920	6102440	and you hit him right in the forehead.
6102440	6106840	His head skin that's made of stone, it cracks
6106840	6108520	and several chips fall off.
6108520	6111440	And he's got a kind of a dark hole in his head now,
6111440	6113320	but he doesn't react like a human would
6113320	6115120	to having his head impaled.
6115120	6118520	In that he's still alive.
6118520	6119320	He does, however.
6119320	6120320	What's the damage on that?
6120320	6121520	Sorry, this is.
6121520	6122880	It's like 80?
6122880	6123800	Come on, man.
6123800	6126440	I'm sorry.
6126440	6128720	The damage is 13.
6128720	6129720	It's not.
6129720	6131160	Well, it says 10 plus 3.
6131160	6134320	10 plus 3, that's it, yep.
6134320	6135320	13.
6135320	6136160	All right.
6136160	6138560	Dealing 12 damage to his face.
6143800	6147760	He staggers back as the force of your blow impacts him
6147760	6151480	and he drops Sharpie in the scuffle.
6151480	6152480	All right.
6152480	6153920	See, I did that for you.
6153920	6155640	Thank you.
6155640	6156720	Let's put it at your turn.
6156720	6157320	All right.
6157320	6160240	So you said now you took all my spells away.
6160240	6162400	No, just the third level ones.
6162400	6166840	You have less of them than any other spells you command.
6166840	6170640	Well, so Shocking Grasp is a level one spell.
6170640	6172720	And I'm right there with him.
6172720	6177280	I just grab him and I whisper in his ear, I mean,
6177280	6181000	this is for Kevin, which means nothing,
6181000	6184880	but I want it to freak him out.
6184920	6186320	And I Shocking Grasp him.
6186320	6189040	This is for Kevin.
6189040	6192720	I know what you did to Kevin.
6192720	6195840	Blinded and confused by your strange words,
6195840	6200520	you find it not difficult at all to grasp him shockingly.
6200520	6203200	And lightning surges through his body.
6203200	6206000	It crackles and burns.
6206000	6208000	The fact his skin is made of stone
6208000	6210200	seems to make it not affect him so much,
6210200	6214640	but it still deals seven damage.
6214640	6215880	Now, don't applaud.
6215880	6216560	Don't.
6216560	6217320	I fucked up.
6217320	6219240	He's made of stone.
6219240	6223120	If he was made of copper, that would have been a bold move.
6223120	6224240	We're made of tinder.
6224240	6225600	Portland, you're better than that.
6225600	6228520	Don't applaud Shocking Grasp on a stone guy.
6228520	6229160	I'm sorry.
6229160	6230360	I let you down.
6230360	6232760	I let your city down.
6232760	6233240	All right.
6233240	6236200	So Father Tinder, he takes a couple steps back
6236200	6238120	and he starts rubbing his eyes.
6238120	6241840	He starts rubbing his eyes and he can see again for once.
6241840	6246120	He takes his large rocky claws and he lifts them up in the air
6246120	6249640	and you see several spikes made out of white energy
6249640	6252200	coalesce in the sky like icicles and start
6252200	6253800	falling all around the area.
6253800	6254320	So.
6254320	6257000	God, he's Halle Berry.
6257000	6258440	In what?
6258440	6259920	X-Men.
6259920	6260400	Swordfish.
6260400	6260880	Storm.
6260880	6263360	Storm.
6263360	6264240	I guess, yeah.
6264240	6267200	I mean, I don't think of Halle Berry as Storm, I guess,
6267200	6267720	on me.
6267720	6269200	Because you saw a swordfish.
6269200	6269920	No, I didn't.
6269920	6271080	I know what you're thinking about.
6271120	6272440	Catwoman.
6272440	6274360	She drinks milk in that.
6274360	6276320	It's sexy.
6276320	6278320	I haven't seen her in Catwoman.
6278320	6281400	It's hilarious how her origin story is.
6281400	6283360	She like works at a makeup factory or something?
6283360	6283920	I don't know.
6283920	6285040	It's horrendous.
6285040	6286920	Cats lick her into being possessed by cats.
6286920	6289360	What's going on with that Batman show, the Gotham?
6289360	6290840	Like they got the what?
6290840	6293880	So the whole show is just before Batman?
6293880	6296800	Brilliant.
6296800	6299600	At Comic Con, they had billboards everywhere for that.
6299600	6301360	And the kerning was kind of off.
6301360	6301880	And so.
6301880	6302960	The kerning was off.
6302960	6304280	No, no, no.
6304280	6305560	Trust me, it's going somewhere.
6305560	6306360	No, I heard it.
6306360	6307200	In the middle.
6307200	6309360	If you crossed your eyes a little bit,
6309360	6310840	it just said, got ham.
6310840	6312920	And.
6312920	6314520	Got ham.
6314520	6316160	And that is a show I would watch.
6316160	6317320	It all takes place.
6317320	6318720	Is Bruce Wayne in the show?
6318720	6319720	Is he a character?
6319720	6320200	I don't.
6320200	6321000	He's a kid.
6321000	6321680	He's a kid.
6321680	6322840	Like he's a lute.
6322840	6326960	So it's like Smallville before Clark Kent.
6326960	6329280	Clark Kent didn't do anything interesting at all.
6329280	6329880	All right.
6329880	6332360	And who's the Mooney Fish person?
6332360	6333560	She's Jada Pinkett Smith.
6333560	6334640	They invented a character.
6334640	6335880	They made a new character up.
6335880	6337520	She's just a fish person later.
6337520	6340000	According to comments on those trailers.
6340000	6343600	Good luck, Gotham.
6343600	6344640	What do I know?
6344640	6348240	I just wrote Monster House.
6348240	6349280	Thank you.
6349280	6351680	What was happening when you guys were getting hit by icicles
6351680	6352080	or something?
6352080	6352960	Halle Berry, right?
6352960	6353480	Yeah.
6353480	6355880	So you guys, you can't dodge out of the way.
6355880	6358040	All these four spikes are too much.
6359040	6359880	Well, let's see here.
6359880	6362440	Quark takes three damage.
6362440	6364080	Christoperg takes five.
6364080	6366720	And you two take eight.
6366720	6367600	OK.
6367600	6369280	I reject that.
6369280	6373040	Well, I mean, you still take it.
6373040	6376000	Except it's a matter of opinion.
6376000	6382320	Sharpie, I haven't fought many stone creatures.
6382320	6386080	What do you think would defeat a stone creature?
6386080	6389080	A stone hates dynamite.
6389080	6391000	I think that's the kryptonite of stone.
6391000	6392800	I mean, we all grew up with that phrase.
6392800	6393760	But come on.
6393760	6396560	Give me some good advice.
6396560	6399040	I'm not sure.
6399040	6402040	Anybody out there ever fight stone creatures?
6402040	6402920	Paper, paper.
6402920	6404720	I'm hearing a lot of paper.
6404720	6407000	Of course.
6407000	6409000	Wait.
6409000	6410880	Pickaxes.
6410880	6411480	That's right.
6411480	6413240	Like a diamond pickaxe would definitely
6413240	6414480	go through this like butter.
6416240	6418080	Earthquakes.
6418080	6418920	Anybody?
6418920	6419440	Water?
6419440	6419920	Water?
6419920	6420400	Water's good.
6420400	6421440	Erosion.
6421440	6424600	I like my idea of like sprinkling him with water
6424600	6427040	and then freezing it and cracking it.
6427040	6429800	Well, I have the ability of creating water.
6429800	6432200	It's not my turn, but I'm going to get back around.
6432200	6433600	Are you speaking as the character?
6433600	6438200	Or are you telling me a new thing?
6438200	6439680	I can create water.
6440040	6443800	I can wash away our trials and tribulations.
6443800	6448320	Because if you created water and then I did ray of frost,
6448320	6450280	maybe we could spin.
6450280	6452840	It's not like Mr. Wizard or anything, like I don't know.
6452840	6455560	Oh, I wish everything was like Mr. Wizard.
6455560	6456320	All right.
6456320	6457800	Sorry, Spencer.
6457800	6460440	Well, sorry, Seth, because it's his turn.
6460440	6464040	You know, I kind of want to hear that level one spell so much
6464040	6467240	that I'm going to use my loot of Charming.
6467960	6472200	And attempt to charm some stuff or things?
6472200	6473040	Some stuff?
6473040	6476880	I mean, probably Tinder Guy.
6476880	6479440	It's been so long since you've played your loot of Charming.
6479440	6482120	It's quite out of tune, and the sounds you make
6482120	6485600	are rather discordant and not charming.
6485600	6487800	He's not charmed.
6487800	6489800	He's not charmed.
6489800	6494240	Sorry, I rolled a three.
6494240	6497520	So let's put it at Krista Berg's turn.
6497520	6499680	All right.
6499680	6502720	Since there's a nice hole in his head,
6502720	6507520	I happen to have a climbing kit with 150 feet of rope.
6507520	6512600	So I'm going to use the climbing kit to climb up him
6512600	6517160	using the hole in his head and hold out my hands,
6517160	6522040	hoping to use some water and frost.
6522040	6524120	I mean, how would you know about that?
6524120	6524920	Play it cool.
6524920	6525920	Just play it cool.
6525920	6527920	I just, you know, I know my teammates so well.
6527920	6528920	We're not allowed to medicate.
6528920	6529920	We're not, yeah.
6529920	6530920	Yeah, good.
6530920	6531920	Intuitive.
6531920	6532920	I'm holding on.
6532920	6533920	I'm holding on waiting.
6533920	6534920	Yeah.
6534920	6537920	Yeah, so you climb a Stride the Beast with your climbing kit,
6537920	6542920	and you ready your next action for the future.
6542920	6543920	What's up?
6543920	6546920	The baby's turn is right after hers.
6546920	6547920	Yes.
6547920	6550920	The baby continues right after hers.
6550920	6554720	The baby continues reaching around in the milky white void,
6554720	6557720	and what he finds may disturb you.
6557720	6558720	Uh-oh.
6558720	6563080	He pulls out his arm from the white portal with a pop,
6563080	6565440	except he doesn't.
6565440	6567000	Instead of an arm, there is no arm.
6567000	6569640	It's completely melted.
6569640	6571200	It's not a vulnerable spot.
6571200	6572960	It's a hydrochloric acid.
6572960	6575960	It's like the strongest spot on his body.
6575960	6580640	Well, at least we sent artificial intelligence to check it out.
6580680	6582000	I'm OK.
6582000	6583720	Just repair me later.
6583720	6585640	All right, prospector, robot baby.
6585640	6588520	Oh, that makes us feel more guilty, R2-D2.
6588520	6589800	Yeah, stop being so happy.
6589800	6591000	I love being kicked.
6591000	6595280	Ah, that baby.
6595280	6596320	The milky white spot.
6596320	6599400	We thought it was like, oh, boy, everybody's
6599400	6600880	super ashamed to have that.
6600880	6602320	And he's like, no, hit me here.
6602320	6603080	Yeah, please.
6603080	6604320	This is what this world represents.
6604320	6605320	It eats everything.
6605320	6606320	Great.
6606320	6608960	It's like a Breaking Bad when they went through the floor.
6611640	6613640	Spoilers?
6613640	6614640	Spoilers?
6614640	6617640	I can't even think of what part of that that was.
6617640	6622640	They're still laying cable down in Portland.
6622640	6625640	It's season one of Breaking Bad, spoilers.
6625640	6626640	They're not quite.
6626640	6629640	Time Warner hasn't come through yet.
6629640	6631640	But I like the sensitivity.
6631640	6632640	It means you care about each other.
6632640	6635640	No, they like the Golden Age of television,
6635640	6636640	and they like storytelling.
6636640	6638640	That's what I got from that.
6639640	6642640	You know, in the wire, the drug dealers win.
6642640	6643640	What?
6643640	6644640	All right.
6644640	6645640	All right.
6645640	6649640	I use create water.
6649640	6650640	For that one.
6650640	6652640	A single clap.
6652640	6655640	I create water.
6655640	6656640	All right.
6656640	6661640	And I say, as Sestrussia has created life before,
6661640	6667640	I shall create water for your death.
6674640	6675640	Dino pants?
6680640	6682640	Oh, it's like the cranberries.
6692640	6695640	H2O, H2O.
6695640	6698640	What does it mean to mean about me that I'm very turned on by you
6698640	6701640	doing that impression?
6701640	6702640	All right.
6702640	6703640	Yeah.
6703640	6704640	So I create water.
6704640	6705640	I try.
6705640	6706640	I try to create water.
6706640	6707640	All right.
6707640	6709640	With Christoper writing a top father tinder and holding his
6709640	6714640	head open, you pour your created water directly into his head
6714640	6715640	void.
6715640	6718640	H2O, H2O.
6718640	6722640	Trickles start to pour out of his mouth and his eyes.
6722640	6725640	Hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen.
6730640	6733640	He turned on for the stage.
6733640	6734640	All right.
6734640	6735640	Yeah, sorry.
6735640	6736640	That happens.
6736640	6738640	So Sharpie.
6738640	6740640	I just leave.
6740640	6743640	I'm going to go look into some real estate.
6744640	6747640	You find several great offers.
6747640	6750640	But I want to check the water pressure on every shower head.
6750640	6753640	The water pressures are optimal.
6753640	6754640	Oh, shit.
6754640	6756640	Well, I mean, is this a...
6756640	6758640	There's no heating units.
6758640	6761640	I cast Frozen.
6764640	6765640	The Disney movie Frozen.
6765640	6766640	Ray of Frost.
6766640	6769640	I cast a DVD of Frozen.
6774640	6776640	She's a role model to women, but when she gets empowered, she
6776640	6778640	has high heels and a slit skirt.
6778640	6781640	I cast Ray of Frost.
6781640	6782640	It's fine also.
6782640	6784640	It's a post-feminist world.
6784640	6787640	You can also be empowered by looking the way you want in your
6787640	6788640	Frozen castle.
6788640	6789640	Frozen.
6789640	6790640	Oh, you're talking Frozen.
6790640	6791640	Yeah, yeah.
6791640	6792640	You know, she goes like, let it go.
6792640	6793640	And she's like, I'm letting it go.
6793640	6794640	I'm like, you're letting it go?
6794640	6796640	Those shoes look really uncomfortable.
6796640	6800640	You made them, but that's fine too.
6801640	6809640	I cast Ray of Frost on the water-filled head wound.
6809640	6810640	This is a Globetrotters move.
6810640	6812640	We all work together.
6812640	6813640	This is going to be amazing.
6813640	6817640	You do those things and you fire off a Ray of Frost.
6817640	6820640	It hits right in his face crack.
6820640	6821640	It's called a head.
6821640	6823640	No, he has a crack in his face.
6823640	6825640	All right.
6826640	6831640	You hear the crackling of ice freezing over as the void in his
6831640	6836640	head becomes occupied by white ice.
6836640	6839640	So at this point, I think it would be Christoper's turn,
6839640	6840640	right?
6840640	6843640	Because you've been holding your action until this happens.
6843640	6846640	Oh, fuck.
6846640	6849640	I thought this was what you wanted.
6849640	6852640	Forget about your nightmare of doing things wrong in front of a
6852640	6855640	group of people.
6855640	6858640	Well, I've still got arrows for my short bow,
6858640	6861640	so I'm going to attempt to just shove.
6861640	6862640	Don't say attempt.
6862640	6869640	I'm going to fucking shove an arrow through that ice.
6869640	6870640	All right.
6870640	6874640	Crack that fucking rock open.
6874640	6875640	Awesome.
6875640	6878640	That's how they do it on Salmon Street.
6878640	6879640	That's how we roll.
6879640	6885640	Shoving your fucking arrows into his facial cracks.
6885640	6889640	The arrows pierce through the ice and you give an expert twist
6889640	6896640	and the entire rocky head explodes crumbling into fragments.
6896640	6898640	And Portland.
6898640	6901640	That's awesome.
6901640	6904640	It's a Northwest paradise.
6904640	6908640	It's the Los Angeles of the upper part of the state,
6908640	6911640	of the country.
6911640	6913640	Oh, that was an ending, right?
6913640	6915640	We exploded the guy's head.
6915640	6918640	His head explodes.
6918640	6920640	Music.
6923640	6926640	Thanks for coming to Harmon Town at XOXO.
6926640	6931640	Spencer Crittenden, our dungeon master and comptroller.
6931640	6935640	Seth, who I hope can move on to the next chapter of his life
6935640	6938640	without his fucking dumbass friends.
6938640	6941640	McKenna, who no matter what you do,
6941640	6944640	you will never live on cooch.
6944640	6946640	My lovely fiance, Erin McGathey,
6946640	6951640	who has taken the bullet of spending the rest of her life with me.
6951640	6953640	And Dustin Marshall, our producer,
6953640	6955640	and Elizabeth the drink maker,
6955640	6956640	and all of you who stayed,
6956640	6963640	and the ghosts, the murdered molten steel murdered ghosts
6963640	6966640	that once occupied this great hall,
6966640	6968640	looking down on us and saying,
6968640	6971640	I helped fight Hitler by making tank parts
6971640	6974640	and now you're doing hipster conferences here.
6974640	6977640	But I support you because this is America.
6977640	6980640	Good night and have a great rest of your festival.
6980640	6986640	Good night, everybody.
