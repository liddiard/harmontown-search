0	24240	Ladies and gentlemen, Hormontown is once again in session.
24240	33240	We've got a goodie for you tonight everybody, won't you please welcome the mayor of Hormontown,
33240	35240	Dan Harmon.
35240	48960	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, grandmaster, grandmaster, master of rap, grandmaster, not
48960	55960	gonna rap about dicks or ass, sir, gonna rap about real things, sophisticated rap,
55960	62960	real things, not ding-a-lings, rap, rap, rap, rap, not gonna rap about dicks or balls, not
62960	69960	gonna rhyme it with Niagara Falls, not gonna rap about butts or nuts, not gonna do it,
69960	74960	but it's hard, just give me a second.
74960	77960	Dan, Dan, Dan, that really wasn't fair to you.
77960	79960	First of all, welcome everybody to Nerd Melts.
79960	85960	Welcome one and all.
85960	87960	Thank you for coming, thank you for listening.
87960	92960	Dan, that wasn't really fair because I was just trying out our new theme song for the tour.
92960	97960	We're doing all unlicensed music, it's all our own music.
97960	100960	Do you want to start off with a proper rap beat?
100960	107960	I have a selection of three unlicensed, totally our own, rap beats.
107960	113960	And I feel that it's only fair for the audience to know that this is the first harm in town
113960	115960	where you are not drinking.
115960	118960	That's true too, you can probably already tell.
118960	119960	Listen, if it goes...
119960	121960	I will clear this theater.
121960	128960	If it goes poorly I'll bail, but I'm this cleanse with Erin, she's my girlfriend, I love her,
128960	134960	I do things out of support for her, and also if she's not eating I won't be fed anyway.
134960	139960	So she's doing this four day cleanse where we drink these green gooey things
139960	143960	and you don't drink liquor on them.
143960	148960	If the show starts going poorly, I promise I'll just collapse into the bottle,
148960	151960	but I wanted to see for the sake of science.
151960	154960	More importantly, speaking of science, I just want to...
154960	155960	Give me one of these beats.
155960	158960	I want to be a good rapper, a sophisticated rapper.
158960	160960	Dan, you've probably not heard these.
160960	163960	I have three selections from our new musical director, Ryan Elder,
163960	166960	who I believe is in the house tonight, Ryan Elder.
170960	175960	Because we're making a documentary here and we can't use Xanadu and some of our favorites
175960	177960	because we can't afford it.
177960	181960	But you people are easy to disappoint tonight.
182960	188960	My physical health and our lack of copyright infringement really has you on a tear.
188960	191960	You poor fucking babies.
191960	194960	Dan, Dan, have a drink.
194960	195960	Sorry.
195960	196960	You have three choices, Dan.
196960	199960	Two more outbursts like that and then I'll have a drink.
200960	202960	Dan, these are your three rap beat choices.
202960	207960	You have sexy slow, you have freestyle, and you have aggressive.
208960	210960	Well, I'm ready.
210960	212960	Are you LL Cool J, I need love?
212960	214960	Are you freestyle?
214960	216960	Are you M&M in it right now?
216960	218960	Are you Beastie Poison?
218960	219960	Let's do aggressive.
219960	220960	You're going to go for aggressive.
224960	225960	The audience has spoken.
225960	226960	Let's see what we got.
226960	228960	All right, clear your head, clear your head.
228960	229960	No dicks, no balls.
238960	239960	Yo, yo.
239960	240960	I rock the microphone.
240960	242960	My name is Dan Harmon.
242960	245960	Some people might try to tell you others aren't for charming.
245960	247960	God damn it, I fucking suck.
247960	250960	I want to get your mom to fuck me.
250960	253960	I want to suck her titties and fuck her pussy so hard.
253960	256960	I want to fuck your mama outside the front yard.
256960	258960	I want to put my dick inside her.
258960	260960	God damn it.
260960	262960	All right, now stop it.
262960	264960	We're not going to reward me for...
264960	266960	I can't take it anymore.
266960	269960	We're going on this tour, Jeff.
269960	271960	We're representing Los Angeles out there.
271960	274960	There's 20 cities waiting for us.
274960	278960	I'm not going to roll into Austin talking about dicks and balls and butts.
278960	282960	I want to write good music.
282960	286960	I want to be a good singer and songwriter.
286960	292960	I don't think people come to Hartmanstown because you're a craftsman when it comes to rapping.
292960	295960	I think they like the free-for-all that it is.
295960	297960	It becomes very adolescent and pure IO.
297960	299960	Let's do it this way.
299960	301960	We've got a big crowd tonight.
301960	307960	Are there any professional singer-songwriters?
307960	310960	Possibly Cambridge educated.
310960	315960	We'll take Oxford, but Cambridge educated singer-songwriters?
315960	318960	A tutorial for Dan.
318960	336960	Thank you for coming.
336960	339960	Thank God.
339960	344960	I am so sorry for what I've done, but this is very fortuitous, Eric.
344960	346960	Thank you for showing up.
346960	348960	This is a comedic and gay icon.
348960	357960	Eric Heidel is here.
357960	359960	Yes, it's Jeff Davis, our comptroller.
359960	361960	Eric, I'm so glad you're here.
361960	366960	Obviously, you're world-renowned for your craftsmanship in comedy songwriting.
366960	375960	There's people in this audience that probably have every single one of your songs memorized.
375960	380960	I have a problem where I like to write songs and I like to improvise them,
380960	386960	but I lose control and I go to a shitty, non-sophisticated place.
386960	389960	You're a hero of mine, a mentor of mine.
389960	390960	Can you please help me?
390960	392960	Can you please tell me how to?
392960	395960	What would you do if you were going to write a perfect song?
395960	400960	It's a very interesting question.
400960	403960	You want to write the perfect song.
403960	412960	When you ask yourself what's true, then open your heart and the truth will start to write the song for you.
412960	418960	Jesus, that's what I'm talking about.
418960	425960	When I first fucked Dan's mother, she asked me for another but I'm what he wants to buy.
425960	429960	I fucked his father and I was all about his nuts.
429960	433960	I doubled his tits and took two shits and put it in their butts.
433960	437960	Harman town, Harman's mommy's on the ground.
437960	440960	Taking bonus by the pound, taking on the town.
440960	444960	Harman town, Harman town, the Harman's mommy's on the ground.
444960	448960	Taking bonus by the pound, taking on the town.
455960	457960	Now, Eric, I have a question.
457960	459960	What would you rather do?
459960	463960	Fuck Dan's mother in the butt or make her eat your poo.
463960	468960	I've asked myself this many times and here is my reply.
468960	472960	I feed her my poo and fuck her butt too and bitter a thumb goodbye.
472960	476960	Harman town, Harman town, Harman's mommy's on the ground.
476960	479960	Taking bonus by the pound, down in Harman town.
479960	483960	Harman town, Harman town, Harman's mommy's on the ground.
483960	486960	Taking bonus by the pound, down in Harman town.
486960	490960	You guys are only doing what I've been doing all along.
490960	492960	I fucked a million mamas already.
492960	494960	I wanted a perfect song.
494960	499960	So open up your heart, my friend, and tell me what you see.
502960	506960	Both your mothers sucking dicks and drinking all my pee.
506960	510960	Harman town, Harman town, Harman's mommy's on the ground.
510960	513960	Taking bonus by the pound, down in Harman town.
513960	517960	Everybody, Harman town, Harman town, Harman's mommy's on the ground.
517960	526960	Taking bonus by the pound, down in Harman town.
526960	527960	Hey!
527960	531960	Aaron fucking island!
557960	562960	Well, you see Dan, you just have to open your mind and let it all come out.
562960	564960	Alright, I think I understand.
564960	572960	Sometimes in all of our lives there comes a crisis when all you really need to set yourself right is for Eric Eitel to come out.
572960	573960	And remind you that...
573960	576960	Sing about nuzzling your father's nuts.
576960	578960	Alright, alright, fine.
578960	580960	Well, why don't we keep the...
580960	586960	Since I'm sober and I'm no entertainment myself and since we are going on the road, why don't we keep the mentorship going?
586960	589960	You know, see if we can keep getting advice and guidance from people.
589960	592960	I want to ask you a question before you do that.
592960	596960	Just while we have the opportunity, you just turned 40.
596960	598960	Your 40th birthday was a few days ago.
605960	609960	And we're going out on this big tour, which is very ambitious.
609960	611960	It's a very long, grueling schedule.
611960	613960	What do you hope to accomplish by this?
613960	617960	Is there a goal for you in terms of what you want to come home with?
617960	619960	What do you want to return with?
619960	622960	What's the golden fleece that you expect to get from this?
622960	627960	Well, I mean, I have a couple of different goals because I'm not a big planner.
627960	631960	And obviously the show is not written.
636960	638960	That's comp trolling.
638960	640960	It's a strike on the music stand.
643960	645960	Don't fight me.
650960	652960	On the tour bus, I get real rapey.
656960	659960	I'll have to bring some of that cassette head cleaner that the people use.
659960	662960	Did you know that that's an underground...
662960	664960	The amyl nitrate kind of stuff?
664960	666960	Well, no, it's like cassette head cleaner.
666960	669960	The fluid, if you huff it, it dilates your anus.
670960	673960	Go on.
673960	675960	End of story.
677960	679960	Sorry, Tron.
679960	681960	This copy's going to have to keep...
682960	684960	Not being playable.
684960	686960	Daddy's going out tonight.
686960	688960	I want to drink so bad.
689960	692960	This is what sobriety feels like.
692960	695960	It feels like everyone else is drunk.
695960	705960	I think one thing that I would like to accomplish is I would like to learn how to love people
705960	708960	because my girlfriend wrote this book.
708960	710960	She didn't write it.
713960	717960	But this is a whole track of conversation that I wanted to talk to everybody about tonight.
717960	720960	But I don't want to delay our next guest.
720960	722960	He's gotten out.
722960	724960	I think we should bring him up and talk to him about touring.
725960	727960	Please welcome to the stage...
728960	730960	Patton Oswalt!
748960	750960	Oh my goodness.
751960	754960	This is exactly the way that I did it on Comedians of Comedy.
754960	758960	I had a massive comedy legend walk out to a song for free.
761960	764960	I think we had Steve Martin in Birmingham one night.
767960	770960	Nichols and May came out one evening.
770960	771960	Wow.
771960	772960	Yeah, it was pretty...
772960	774960	Is there a reunion for them?
774960	776960	Yeah, I just Facebooked them.
776960	778960	Yeah, we'll come down, no problem.
779960	781960	I found Eric on Craigslist.
781960	782960	Oh, really?
782960	783960	Yeah.
783960	784960	You can do...
784960	786960	Because when I do Python searches, I find way different stuff.
786960	787960	I'm just saying.
787960	789960	I type in Python.
793960	794960	Describe to me the tour.
794960	796960	What are you doing?
796960	797960	Don't know.
797960	798960	Help me help you.
798960	803960	We're leaving on the 10th at 10 a.m. as far as I know.
803960	804960	8 a.m.
804960	805960	Okay.
806960	808960	Okay, just let me stop right there.
808960	810960	Try to coordinate the day and time.
810960	812960	Haven't made the same number.
812960	813960	Already?
813960	814960	This is already working.
814960	815960	Good luck, yeah.
815960	816960	I'm already glad we got this kind out here.
816960	817960	Okay, good.
817960	820960	Heading from Los Angeles to Phoenix, where we're going to do a show,
820960	822960	for God knows how many people are actually going to show up.
822960	823960	You're going to...
823960	824960	I'm sorry, you're starting the tour.
824960	826960	Your first show is going to be in Phoenix.
828960	831960	So basically, you are...
831960	833960	That's the equivalent of,
833960	838960	all right, I know that there's some chocolate mousse down the road,
838960	842960	but we're going to have cold green beans right now
842960	844960	to really make that a treat when it shows up.
844960	845960	Wait, wait.
845960	848960	Patton, what do you know about Phoenix that we don't know?
848960	850960	Performing in Phoenix is basically...
850960	852960	Have you ever been to Phoenix?
852960	855960	Yeah, I was there when I was signing some comic books once.
855960	856960	Oh, okay.
856960	857960	Yours?
858960	861960	No, I wrote some for...
862960	865960	I didn't sign just some Iron Man shit that I had.
865960	866960	The way you said it was like,
866960	868960	I went to Phoenix and I signed some comic books.
868960	869960	Just like graffiti?
869960	871960	That's when you were really hammered.
871960	873960	Yeah, I was at a low point.
873960	874960	One night, it started at Cat and Fiddle,
874960	877960	and next thing I knew I was in Phoenix signing comic books.
878960	880960	It was right after Sarah Silverman fired me, I was just like,
880960	882960	I wrote this, I wrote that, I wrote this, I wrote that.
882960	884960	I was just signing everything.
887960	888960	I was signing...
888960	890960	You don't care what the answer is.
890960	893960	I was signing Rob Shropp comic books that I wrote.
893960	894960	It's good.
894960	896960	Rob Shropp's in the house tonight, everybody.
898960	899960	There he is.
899960	901960	Scud the Disposable Assassin.
901960	903960	Highly recommended.
903960	905960	I believe the hardback collection is here in the store,
905960	907960	if you want to...
907960	908960	Yes.
908960	911960	Phoenix is an abandoned moon colony
911960	916960	if all of the astronauts were Mexican and on crank.
916960	918960	That is how to think of it.
919960	921960	That is basically the setting.
921960	924960	And if you see any white people,
924960	927960	they are either cryptically racist
927960	932960	or so gleefully openly racist that it's kind of charming.
936960	938960	We're kind of hoping because of our podcast
938960	942960	that we're going to draw a similar essential crowd
942960	944960	that we get here.
944960	945960	Is that possible?
946960	948960	But here's the thing you have to keep in mind.
948960	952960	Every city in America has this.
952960	953960	These kind of...
953960	956960	The smart people, the dreamers, the artists.
956960	958960	I'm just saying, you are...
958960	961960	And may I also point out the pasty and frightened.
962960	964960	Before you start going,
965960	968960	Don't run into the street and start steam dancing.
970960	971960	You'll throw something.
971960	972960	We can do it.
972960	973960	Punch.
974960	979960	But some cities are a much more soaked sponge than others.
979960	983960	So Phoenix, you're really going to be wringing that sponge
983960	987960	to get as much of this as you possibly can.
987960	989960	You don't have any advice on how I can do that, do you?
989960	991960	Don't say morning zoo teams.
991960	992960	No.
992960	994960	Well, morning zoo teams, unfortunately, they're A,
994960	997960	you have to be funny on their terms.
997960	998960	And I've done those.
998960	999960	Shouty, desperate.
999960	1001960	The satellite tours where you just go...
1002960	1004960	You do three hour block and you just hold there
1004960	1006960	and then go, okay, Dan, are you ready?
1006960	1009960	This is Harold and Kazoo in the mornings.
1009960	1010960	You ready? Yeah, okay.
1010960	1012960	And then you just cut into the middle of this thing
1012960	1014960	and they're like, oh, okay.
1014960	1016960	Up next is some asshole we've never heard of.
1018960	1021960	Dan Herman apparently doing something called
1021960	1023960	Exarptable Tarfire.
1023960	1025960	How did you pronounce those wrong?
1025960	1027960	I love the morning zoos where the guy,
1027960	1030960	the DJ himself is on the phone
1030960	1033960	using his actual human voice before he brings you on the air
1033960	1036960	going, hey, Pat, thanks so much for calling in, man.
1036960	1037960	I got to do this stupid show.
1037960	1039960	It's the dumbest thing ever.
1039960	1041960	Look, I like what you do, man.
1041960	1042960	But unless we...
1042960	1044960	This is the market I'm in.
1044960	1045960	So you're cool, right?
1045960	1046960	I'm like, yeah, I guess so.
1046960	1048960	Okay, so we're going to be on in like three, two...
1048960	1049960	Hey, it's flappy.
1049960	1052960	We're going to have a fantastic time.
1052960	1055960	And I'm going to say, lead a remedy.
1055960	1057960	So, hey, let's do something.
1057960	1059960	And then just all these awful...
1059960	1061960	And they make you do...
1061960	1065960	All their inside jokes, you have to join their smurf patch.
1065960	1066960	Oh, exactly, yeah.
1066960	1068960	Hey, give us an AIDS bomb.
1068960	1070960	Why do you want an AIDS bomb?
1070960	1073960	I did one because I do improv.
1073960	1075960	Jeff, you do improv.
1075960	1076960	Yeah, you're on the show.
1076960	1077960	You do the improv.
1077960	1080960	How about doing a little rap for us about the pinch of the pump?
1080960	1082960	The pinch of the pump.
1082960	1083960	The pinch of the pump.
1083960	1085960	And then, yeah, it's all these weird in-jokes
1085960	1088960	that they have not filled you in on the beginnings of.
1088960	1090960	So, hey, it's 9-17 on Thursday morning.
1090960	1091960	You know what I mean?
1091960	1093960	That baby pattern, beef stew.
1093960	1094960	What?
1094960	1095960	All right.
1095960	1096960	And then they...
1096960	1098960	I also love the weird...
1098960	1102960	If you don't immediately pitch it to their kind of whack-a-doodle,
1102960	1104960	it's a party at 6-18 a.m.
1104960	1107960	If you don't hit that level, they immediately get angry with you
1107960	1109960	and try to get rid of you, like,
1109960	1112960	whoa, let's get this party pooper out of here and have some fun.
1112960	1114960	Well, it looks like we just wandered into the...
1115960	1118960	Fossil yard with a foghorn.
1118960	1120960	Fossil yard with a foghorn.
1120960	1122960	Right.
1122960	1124960	Well, while Spence puts us on his sleep,
1124960	1126960	I want to tell you about our flapjack snack attack
1126960	1129960	with Foghat down at the IHOP on Route 29.
1129960	1131960	That's right, it's the Foghat flapjack snack attack.
1131960	1134960	Come on down, bring a plate, stack them high.
1134960	1137960	Coming up next, we got the I Hate My Boss donut tosser.
1137960	1138960	Bring your card out here.
1138960	1140960	It'll be tossing donuts off the roof,
1140960	1142960	bring a bucket if you catch one.
1142960	1145960	You get a pair of KTRT, the turtle panties,
1145960	1146960	that you can wear.
1146960	1147960	Turtle panties?
1147960	1148960	It's just...
1148960	1150960	Turtle panties?
1150960	1151960	Turtle panties.
1151960	1153960	There actually are now...
1153960	1155960	There are things you're going to have to avoid doing
1155960	1157960	or you'll bring the wrong people to your show.
1157960	1159960	Although, that said,
1159960	1161960	sometimes bringing the wrong people to your show
1161960	1164960	can make the show kind of amazing.
1164960	1166960	They don't quite know what's going on.
1166960	1169960	But what I don't want to happen is I don't want the 11 people in Phoenix
1169960	1172960	that actually, like, love me.
1172960	1173960	Yeah.
1173960	1176960	I don't want them subjected to the 20 people
1176960	1179960	that wandered into Chuckle Nux
1179960	1181960	going like, let's just see comedy tonight.
1181960	1182960	Right.
1182960	1184960	And by that, I assume someone as funny as Patton Oswalt
1184960	1185960	will be coming out here.
1185960	1187960	And then I come out and go,
1187960	1192960	I have asthma and my girlfriend loves me too much.
1192960	1195960	Sometimes it makes me feel like a bad person.
1195960	1197960	What the fuck's going on here?
1197960	1200960	I kick in my fans' chairs and I'm like,
1200960	1202960	hey, leave them alone.
1202960	1206960	Well, one thing that does kind of help if you're on Twitter
1206960	1209960	is interact with people that have been at the show.
1209960	1211960	And if you keep that conversation going,
1211960	1214960	other people from other cities will see that you're kind of...
1214960	1216960	They'll start tracking you as you move across.
1216960	1219960	And I only did that with a website in MySpace.
1219960	1221960	I didn't have Twitter when I was doing this.
1221960	1224960	Well, you know, we're going to podcast every single night.
1224960	1226960	Like, we're doing like a show a day.
1226960	1228960	And we're going to get on the bus
1228960	1230960	and then podcast out the performance.
1230960	1231960	Okay, let me stop.
1231960	1232960	All right.
1234960	1237960	That, I know that you're right now in your head,
1237960	1240960	you're like, yes, we're going to document everything
1240960	1242960	and it's going to be fucking Hunter S. Thompson
1242960	1244960	and the lawyer and the Cadillac.
1244960	1245960	And I'm going to have the typewriter on my lap
1245960	1247960	and I'm going to chronicle every minute.
1247960	1248960	Yeah, yeah.
1248960	1252960	You will hit a wall way sooner than you think you're going to hit it
1253960	1257960	where you are going to not want your life documented.
1257960	1261960	You're like, you will start, you will fall into this weird sullen.
1261960	1264960	I guarantee you one of your podcasts will just be a,
1264960	1268960	hey, Stan, and we're in Vegas and I don't know.
1268960	1270960	I mean, we drove all day and now we're here.
1270960	1271960	Oh.
1271960	1272960	And I don't know. I don't know.
1272960	1273960	This...
1273960	1274960	I don't fucking know.
1274960	1275960	I mean, it's...
1275960	1277960	So, I don't know.
1277960	1278960	Fuck.
1278960	1280960	I mean, I don't know. I don't know.
1280960	1281960	What do you want?
1281960	1282960	What do you want me to stay?
1282960	1283960	Like...
1283960	1284960	But it'll be a really...
1284960	1286960	There'll be a weird, insightful moment
1286960	1287960	where you will start to realize,
1287960	1289960	oh, people that are on reality shows
1289960	1291960	that want to be filmed all the time,
1291960	1293960	those, they are sociopaths
1293960	1296960	because they don't hit the wall that I've just hit
1296960	1299960	where they are never tired of a camera and microphone show.
1299960	1301960	Yeah, they're just constantly...
1301960	1303960	They're like solar calculators.
1305960	1308960	But there's a little misunderstanding here.
1309960	1312960	The show is going to be the podcast.
1312960	1313960	Right.
1313960	1314960	Because I don't...
1314960	1316960	Unlike you, you have...
1316960	1319960	Well, probably by now you have a solid three hours
1319960	1321960	of really refined material that...
1321960	1322960	Yeah, you're right.
1322960	1323960	You're right.
1323960	1325960	Yeah, go ahead. I'm not gonna...
1328960	1329960	But I can't...
1329960	1331960	When I go out in front of people, I don't...
1331960	1332960	So, I'm kind of forcing myself...
1332960	1335960	Because what's for sale is not what's for sale with you.
1335960	1336960	So, I'm going the other direction
1336960	1339960	and refusing to allow myself to have any...
1339960	1343960	They're going to be able to hear the show in Phoenix in Austin.
1343960	1345960	And then I'm going to show up in Austin and go,
1345960	1347960	how about that show in Phoenix?
1347960	1348960	Remember when I got my ass kicked?
1348960	1349960	Wasn't that crazy?
1349960	1352960	But we're going to be doing shows in various venues
1352960	1354960	where a lot of their audience will be local.
1354960	1356960	They promote their own audience.
1356960	1359960	These comedy clubs promote their own kind of loyal fan base.
1359960	1360960	Right, Patton?
1360960	1364960	Yeah, we ran into some trouble on one of these
1365960	1366960	because they have...
1366960	1369960	Some clubs kind of have their own corporate culture
1369960	1372960	where their fans have a certain behavior
1372960	1374960	that they try to encourage because it just means more.
1374960	1375960	Oh, no.
1375960	1376960	Sales with them.
1376960	1377960	Here's your pickle flappers.
1377960	1378960	Yeah, there was a...
1378960	1379960	Portland?
1379960	1381960	There was a club in Champaign, Illinois
1381960	1384960	that sent out a thing to it and they had it on their website.
1384960	1387960	These comedians love loud hecklers.
1387960	1388960	What?
1388960	1389960	So, come out and...
1389960	1390960	What?
1390960	1391960	I swear to God.
1391960	1392960	We didn't realize what had happened
1392960	1393960	until after the show.
1393960	1394960	We went to their website.
1394960	1395960	No.
1395960	1396960	After the show, people were coming up.
1396960	1398960	I've never been in front of a drunker crowd.
1398960	1401960	And they were heckling as you would walk.
1401960	1402960	The minute they would go,
1402960	1403960	and like I said, I'm a Maria Bamford.
1403960	1404960	Goddammit!
1404960	1405960	What the fuck?
1405960	1408960	As you were walking up, they're yelling at you
1408960	1410960	like you're mounting the guillotine
1410960	1411960	and they're just screaming,
1411960	1412960	You!
1412960	1413960	I'm looking at you!
1413960	1417960	You haven't watched up with their own folded clothes
1417960	1418960	in their hands.
1418960	1420960	There's toilet paper flaming coming out.
1421960	1422960	I don't know if you know this,
1422960	1424960	but we're traveling with our dungeon master
1424960	1426960	because we play D&D in our shows.
1426960	1428960	Oh yeah, definitely go to Phoenix then.
1428960	1429960	Yeah, that's...
1429960	1432960	You guys are like freedom riders in the south
1432960	1433960	in the 60s.
1433960	1435960	That's going to...
1435960	1438960	Bulldozers are going to be exhuming your corpses.
1441960	1443960	Spencer, you're in deep shit, man.
1443960	1444960	Yeah, yeah.
1445960	1446960	We did...
1446960	1447960	Okay, we did a club in...
1447960	1449960	Are you doing anything in Washington, D.C.?
1450960	1451960	No.
1451960	1453960	Are we in Maryland or somewhere?
1453960	1456960	We're in Arlington, Virginia.
1456960	1458960	At the Cinnamon Drafthouse?
1458960	1459960	Yes.
1459960	1460960	Birchmere.
1460960	1462960	We're at the Taj Mahaha.
1463960	1465960	In Virginia...
1467960	1469960	Taj Mahaha!
1469960	1472960	Again, I did a club called Sir Laughs-a-Lot.
1472960	1473960	No!
1473960	1474960	I'm not kidding.
1474960	1475960	In Milwaukee.
1475960	1476960	Yeah, that's Milwaukee.
1476960	1477960	That's my hometown.
1477960	1478960	Sir Laughs-a-Lot.
1478960	1479960	Yeah.
1479960	1481960	It's men only.
1481960	1484960	All I'm saying is we did the Black Cat in D.C.
1484960	1487960	and the show was so packed.
1487960	1489960	I felt very gratified.
1489960	1490960	We have sold out the Black Cat.
1490960	1492960	It was a club I would go to when I was young.
1492960	1494960	But, well, hang on.
1494960	1496960	So, afterwards I'm talking to the club owner
1496960	1498960	and he's really nice and I said,
1498960	1501960	Hey, so, I really sold the place out, huh?
1501960	1505960	He goes, yeah, I mean, you know, we...
1506960	1511960	You had about 730 tickets sold.
1511960	1514960	I'm like, well, I mean, it was literally wall to wall.
1514960	1517960	Yeah, I mean, we do a lot of...
1517960	1520960	The place holds about 900.
1520960	1524960	We normally do thrash shows here and punk shows.
1524960	1528960	Your fans tend to be a little...
1528960	1532960	Literally, our fans are always chubby nerds
1532960	1535960	and they can only put, like, a bunch of little,
1535960	1537960	messed out thrash fans.
1537960	1539960	Yeah, they can easily get 900 of them in there.
1539960	1540960	But our fans are...
1540960	1543960	I'm very excited to come see Zach Galifianakis
1543960	1546960	and Brian Postade.
1546960	1549960	And so, I got the DVRs catching all the Dr. Huda nights.
1549960	1551960	I can watch that at the morning.
1551960	1553960	Well, that's a love thing.
1553960	1557960	There's sections in the country where this can work in our favor.
1557960	1558960	Oh, exactly.
1558960	1559960	You have way more math.
1559960	1560960	It's a full house.
1560960	1563960	Seven people.
1563960	1564960	Well, normally...
1564960	1567960	Your audience is so fat when they have a full house.
1567960	1569960	They really... Yeah.
1569960	1570960	This place holds...
1570960	1571960	They're not even full.
1571960	1574960	This place holds 900 punk fans or 11 rascal scooters.
1574960	1577960	So you guys did really well tonight.
1577960	1579960	We had...
1579960	1582960	Well, this has been edifying.
1582960	1584960	Yeah. So then, Patton, real quick,
1584960	1587960	I'll just list off from memory where we're going.
1587960	1590960	If one of these cities brings back horror stories or fun...
1590960	1591960	I cannot...
1591960	1592960	I'll just tell you right now,
1592960	1594960	I can't wait to hear the Phoenix podcast.
1594960	1595960	That's all I'm saying.
1595960	1596960	That's going to be interesting.
1596960	1598960	After that, we go to Austin, Texas, which is good.
1598960	1599960	Yeah, that's a gimme.
1599960	1602960	Then we're going to Atlanta.
1602960	1608960	Atlanta is weirdly either fun or awful.
1608960	1612960	The one thing I love about Atlanta is the freak scene there.
1612960	1613960	That's the one place...
1613960	1616960	Because it's so hot and so humid.
1616960	1617960	There's this...
1617960	1620960	We drove by this goth club called The Vault,
1620960	1623960	and it was early eating like 5 o'clock.
1623960	1625960	It had to be 111 degrees out.
1625960	1629960	So watching all the goths with just their makeup...
1629960	1632960	They're all in black, and they're waiting to get into The Vault,
1632960	1635960	and they're so committed, but it's all...
1635960	1639960	A goth in Atlanta is a fucking hero.
1639960	1642960	That is a superhero when it's like...
1642960	1645960	That black lipstick is just running out.
1645960	1648960	It looked like I was eating dead syrup.
1648960	1651960	We're sold out in Atlanta, aren't we?
1651960	1652960	Of course you are.
1652960	1655960	Then it's Nashville and Charlotte.
1655960	1656960	For some reason...
1656960	1659960	Also, I don't know how many gigs you guys did on your tour
1659960	1661960	and what the pace was,
1661960	1664960	but it's almost every night we're doing a show.
1664960	1665960	That's how it was for us.
1665960	1668960	We're in Brooklyn the next night from Charlotte.
1668960	1669960	Holy shit.
1669960	1671960	And it's going to be January.
1671960	1672960	It's going to be...
1672960	1675960	And then we go up into the Northeast
1675960	1678960	and then across the top of the country during late January.
1678960	1679960	What the... Really?
1679960	1680960	Yeah.
1680960	1681960	It's...
1681960	1683960	It's my first tour.
1683960	1684960	Yeah.
1684960	1686960	It's going to be your last tour.
1686960	1687960	I didn't want...
1687960	1689960	Again, that was sitting right there, but...
1689960	1691960	Well, you know, there's a good chance
1691960	1693960	that you're going to get to be one of those...
1693960	1695960	Oh, what else would he have done?
1695960	1697960	Yeah, what an amazing legend he was.
1698960	1701960	That semi-hadn't jackknifed on...
1701960	1703960	Who knows who would have fired him?
1703960	1704960	Yeah, maybe...
1710960	1711960	Wow.
1711960	1713960	Dan, I don't... Wow.
1713960	1716960	The Northeast in January.
1716960	1719960	Then there's one night we go from Kansas City, Kansas
1719960	1721960	to Denver, Colorado.
1721960	1723960	That's a long... That's a long pull, right?
1723960	1726960	And also, Denver at this time of year is really dicey
1726960	1729960	to get to with the ice and the...
1729960	1730960	And the Rocky Mountains?
1730960	1731960	Yeah.
1731960	1732960	You're getting into, like, you know,
1732960	1734960	Scatman Crothers and the Shining.
1734960	1736960	Go get a fucking Hobiecat or something
1736960	1738960	to get through that snow.
1738960	1740960	It's going to be bad.
1740960	1742960	I would take, you know,
1742960	1745960	take some sturdy pioneer women to eat
1745960	1749960	in case you get stuck in a snowstorm or something.
1751960	1755960	What's your pemmican budget on this tour?
1757960	1759960	Holy shit, Dan.
1759960	1762960	Everyone get a clipping of his clothes as a relic
1762960	1763960	because this could be it.
1763960	1765960	I mean, this is like James D. like,
1765960	1767960	fuck off, I'm getting in my convertible.
1767960	1769960	See you later.
1769960	1771960	It's almost certain that we're going to miss a gig or two
1771960	1773960	on this thing because it's so breakneck
1773960	1774960	and it's going to be bad weather.
1774960	1775960	Yeah.
1775960	1776960	And, you know, it's also, you know,
1776960	1778960	the weather's getting worse and worse.
1778960	1781960	You know, like, there's more storms, more traffic.
1781960	1782960	We're fucked.
1782960	1784960	What the...
1785960	1786960	Fine, we're fucked.
1786960	1788960	Goodbye, dude.
1788960	1790960	I mean, but if you say you're fucked enough,
1790960	1794960	you garner the favor of a very gullible god, right?
1794960	1795960	Yeah, no, that's true.
1795960	1796960	Well, it's like in the theater they say,
1796960	1797960	if you say it, it won't happen.
1797960	1801960	Now, that antler, that moose thing on the wall,
1801960	1802960	it looks kind of rickety.
1802960	1804960	If you said it, it's not going to fall.
1804960	1806960	Like, that kind of thing.
1807960	1808960	It's theater superstition.
1808960	1810960	As many weird rituals as you can think of,
1810960	1812960	do them every morning.
1812960	1814960	Spinning witter shins, rabbit feet.
1814960	1815960	I don't know what.
1815960	1816960	Just...
1817960	1819960	Patton, were you guys on the bus the whole time?
1819960	1820960	Were you always on the bus?
1820960	1821960	How many breaks were there?
1821960	1822960	Hotels?
1822960	1823960	Oh, no, we were always on the bus.
1823960	1825960	Sometimes we would just get a day room
1825960	1827960	or we could use the day room and shower and change
1827960	1830960	because we couldn't afford four hotel rooms.
1830960	1834960	So we stayed in some hotels that were so super.
1834960	1839960	Like, the ghosts of so many ex-suicidal truckers
1840960	1842960	were just crying out for the mattresses.
1842960	1845960	I don't know what kind of hotel accommodations you've...
1845960	1846960	Where do you think you're staying?
1846960	1848960	Are you sleeping on the bus?
1848960	1850960	There's some things where we have to get in the bus
1850960	1851960	right after the show
1851960	1854960	because it's a giant long haul to somewhere else.
1854960	1855960	There will be gigs where we land.
1855960	1858960	We have a couple hotel rooms to shower and shave
1858960	1860960	and that kind of stuff.
1860960	1863960	Right now, Bob Seger is feeling a huge disturbance in the forest
1863960	1865960	wherever he's sitting.
1865960	1866960	He's like, Jesus, someone...
1866960	1868960	Oh, someone's going to die.
1868960	1871960	I feel it. I got to do something.
1871960	1873960	But I'll warm up my Grammy fingers.
1873960	1874960	Yeah, exactly.
1874960	1875960	At least the bus will be relaxing
1875960	1877960	because there's going to be cameras everywhere
1877960	1879960	and we're making a movie the whole time.
1879960	1880960	Oh, yeah, that's good.
1880960	1882960	And we're podcasting our thing from the bus every day.
1882960	1883960	It's going to be awesome.
1883960	1885960	I don't... Wow.
1885960	1887960	All we had were cameras.
1887960	1888960	Again, this is...
1888960	1889960	And again, in 10 years,
1889960	1891960	what you're doing is going to seem quaint.
1891960	1892960	Like, yeah.
1892960	1894960	They didn't have any of the anal mics.
1894960	1895960	It was weird.
1895960	1897960	It was only 2013.
1897960	1898960	It was a simple time.
1898960	1900960	What's going on with this guy's butt, Lillie?
1900960	1901960	Yeah.
1901960	1902960	Well, is there anything before...
1902960	1904960	I know your time is precious.
1904960	1905960	Very precious.
1905960	1906960	Yes.
1906960	1911960	And is there anything uplifting you'd like to say before you go?
1911960	1912960	Here's the one...
1912960	1914960	And this is a truly uplifting thing I will try to leave you with.
1914960	1916960	If you do a successful tour,
1916960	1917960	as much of a...
1917960	1919960	as soul grinding as it is
1919960	1921960	and as physically exhausting as it is,
1921960	1922960	when you do a long tour
1922960	1923960	and you come back to whatever your home city,
1923960	1924960	especially L.A.,
1924960	1928960	your home city seems so manageable and tameable
1928960	1932960	after being out there in this gigantic, crazy country.
1932960	1933960	You come back to L.A. and you're like,
1933960	1935960	I can get anything done here.
1935960	1937960	And successful is just defined by finishing it, right?
1937960	1940960	Like, not by everything being, you know, successful.
1940960	1941960	Oh, no, no.
1941960	1942960	I mean, the...
1942960	1943960	I almost wish...
1943960	1944960	It's like, when I was a wedding DJ,
1944960	1945960	we had this thing where...
1945960	1947960	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1947960	1949960	All right.
1949960	1950960	You're a wedding DJ?
1950960	1951960	I've spoken...
1951960	1952960	No, when I was.
1952960	1953960	Oh, yeah.
1953960	1954960	You were.
1954960	1955960	Not now.
1955960	1957960	Although there's some cards on it, if you want to grab it.
1957960	1961960	But we had a thing where at a wedding,
1961960	1962960	a successful...
1962960	1963960	It was a sign of a successful marriage
1963960	1966960	if one thing went wrong at the wedding.
1966960	1970960	So a successful tour has got to have one night.
1970960	1973960	It's like a, you know, like the Judas, basically.
1973960	1975960	One night where everything fucking goes wrong
1975960	1977960	that you can then set everything else against.
1977960	1978960	Yeah, that's what I figure,
1978960	1981960	but it could also be eight nights, right?
1981960	1982960	There's no reason for it.
1982960	1983960	But then that...
1983960	1985960	Yeah, if our bad night happens two nights in,
1985960	1986960	that's bad.
1986960	1987960	Yeah, exactly.
1987960	1990960	But look, you're guaranteed one good night with Austin.
1990960	1991960	I'm telling you that right now.
1991960	1992960	All right.
1992960	1993960	You're sorry.
1993960	1994960	Yeah, I've been to Austin.
1994960	1997960	Yeah, they seem like their hipsters are good kids
1997960	1999960	because they're hipsters in a state
1999960	2002960	that doesn't even respect America.
2002960	2004960	No, I know.
2004960	2005960	They're hipsters.
2005960	2007960	The hipsters in Austin are like that compound
2007960	2009960	in the Road Warrior of the hippies.
2010960	2014960	You're like Mad Max pulling in with the gasoline, you know?
2014960	2016960	You want to let her code in references?
2016960	2017960	You talk to me.
2017960	2019960	Like, it's that kind of...
2019960	2020960	All right.
2020960	2022960	Well, let's thank Patton Oswell for coming by.
2022960	2023960	Thank you.
2023960	2024960	Thank you.
2037960	2040960	Oh, I want to drink so bad.
2040960	2042960	Is the booze calling in?
2042960	2043960	Well, yeah.
2043960	2046960	Valley high.
2046960	2048960	That was...
2048960	2051960	That was what I wanted, I guess.
2051960	2053960	He gave us real information.
2053960	2054960	Yeah.
2054960	2059960	He didn't just say, don't take a shit in the bus, you know?
2059960	2061960	I can't remind you of that enough, by the way.
2061960	2062960	No, no.
2062960	2063960	That's good advice.
2063960	2064960	I'm just saying, I expect to wear that.
2064960	2067960	Well, you know, whenever you see a gas station,
2067960	2069960	make sure you buy some pants.
2069960	2070960	Why?
2070960	2072960	Because this is something you can't know
2072960	2073960	until you're on the road.
2073960	2076960	You always need pants to make your antenna work.
2076960	2078960	Just some weird shit.
2078960	2083960	But he really put the scare on me.
2083960	2084960	Are you nervous now?
2084960	2085960	Yeah.
2085960	2087960	But you know who else was nervous?
2087960	2089960	Jesus Christ.
2089960	2090960	Uh-oh.
2090960	2091960	That sounds like a rap.
2091960	2092960	He turned out fine.
2092960	2093960	That sounds like a rap.
2097960	2099960	This is rap number two called freestyle.
2099960	2100960	Freestyle?
2100960	2101960	Yeah.
2101960	2103960	We got to work out these raps.
2103960	2105960	Yo, freestyle.
2105960	2107960	Yo, rapping for a while.
2107960	2110960	Got a sober rap coming at your ass.
2110960	2114960	I got Howard Hessman at the head of the class.
2114960	2119960	Stock rhymes coming out all the time.
2119960	2120960	Freestyle.
2120960	2121960	Got a sober style.
2121960	2122960	Got a freestyle.
2122960	2123960	Got a sober rap.
2123960	2126960	It's going badly.
2126960	2128960	Your mom's named Headly.
2128960	2129960	It's a name.
2129960	2130960	You can look it up.
2130960	2132960	I saw your mama.
2132960	2135960	I got a drink.
2135960	2136960	I got to have a drink.
2136960	2138960	I never told you not to drink.
2138960	2140960	I never told you not to drink.
2140960	2141960	Are you going to do it?
2141960	2142960	Be strong, man.
2142960	2144960	Be strong.
2144960	2146960	It's like the price is right.
2153960	2155960	And it's not fair if the people saying drink are louder
2155960	2157960	because you're drunk.
2157960	2159960	By cheering, how many of you out there
2159960	2162960	wish he wouldn't drink to continue the experiment?
2167960	2168960	Okay.
2168960	2172960	Now, how many people want to see Dan drink?
2174960	2176960	That's a minority.
2176960	2179960	Less people but drunker and louder.
2179960	2181960	You know what else is a minority?
2181960	2182960	Black people.
2182960	2184960	Rap about race.
2184960	2185960	Slow rap.
2185960	2187960	Smooth, slow rap.
2187960	2189960	Sexy slow.
2191960	2192960	Feel the beat.
2192960	2193960	It's the first time you're hearing this.
2193960	2195960	I feel the groove here, man.
2196960	2198960	Rapping about race.
2199960	2201960	Rapping about race.
2202960	2207960	Rapping about the complications with the color of your face.
2208960	2211960	Some people got dark skin.
2211960	2213960	Some people got light.
2213960	2215960	Some people purple.
2215960	2216960	Some people white.
2216960	2220960	But we've got to come together in a big spaceship.
2220960	2226960	We've got to come together in a big spaceship.
2227960	2229960	Rap about race.
2229960	2232960	I met an Indian man in China.
2232960	2235960	He said my race couldn't look finer.
2235960	2238960	He took my hand and accepted me.
2238960	2241960	We went up to the top of a coconut tree.
2241960	2245960	He said, why don't you hold my body?
2245960	2248960	I said, I'll hold your body.
2249960	2251960	He said, I want you to hold me.
2251960	2254960	I said, hold me.
2256960	2258960	Rap about race.
2259960	2261960	Rap about race.
2262960	2264960	It's a rap about race.
2265960	2267960	It's a rap about race.
2267960	2269960	I got a black friend.
2269960	2270960	He's my shield.
2270960	2272960	Got a black friend.
2272960	2275960	I can feel however I want
2275960	2278960	when I'm standing next to my black friends.
2278960	2281960	I'm not racist, but blah, blah, blah.
2281960	2285960	I can say that shit because I got my black friend
2285960	2288960	chillin' it on the sideline.
2288960	2291960	We go to get food, my black friend says.
2291960	2294960	I think I'm in the mood for fried chicken
2294960	2298960	and it's not racist because he's black.
2298960	2299960	What?
2299960	2301960	Sorry.
2301960	2303960	There's a downside.
2304960	2309960	I'm always terrified when he speaks up.
2311960	2313960	The chicken's always fried.
2313960	2315960	Thank you, Antique.
2315960	2318960	That was a nice slow rap about race.
2318960	2324960	Also, if by rap you mean you sang the entire thing.
2324960	2325960	All right.
2325960	2326960	Everyone's a critic.
2326960	2328960	No, no, I'm saying that was nice.
2328960	2331960	I think Eric Idle's advice, now you're singing.
2331960	2335960	That was like a cool Keith Sweat kind of R&B
2335960	2336960	kind of thing going on.
2336960	2337960	All right.
2337960	2341960	Well, let's keep the fever pitch rolling, right?
2341960	2343960	There's only one thing that I really knew
2343960	2344960	that I wanted to talk about,
2344960	2346960	and it starts with the fact that my beautiful,
2346960	2349960	perfect girlfriend, Erin McGathey,
2349960	2354960	for those of you who don't know,
2354960	2356960	we always hate surprise parties.
2356960	2357960	We've done them in the past.
2357960	2359960	Surprise parties seem like a very strange thing
2359960	2360960	to have to do to people,
2360960	2364960	because the fact that the party exists is the surprise.
2364960	2367960	And then you spend the entire day tricking people
2367960	2370960	into thinking that no one's doing anything for them.
2370960	2374960	And then their surprise is, oh, you did.
2374960	2377960	And it just seems like it causes a lot of misery.
2377960	2378960	So we both agree.
2378960	2380960	She was like, I'll never throw you a surprise party,
2380960	2382960	but could I do this thing for you
2382960	2384960	that would be a surprise at your party?
2384960	2386960	Can the nature of your party be a surprise for you?
2386960	2388960	Yes, of course, darling.
2389960	2391960	She published a fucking book
2391960	2393960	of all of my bullshit from the internet,
2393960	2395960	most of which is filled with me
2395960	2399960	either talking about jerking off to other women
2399960	2402960	or dating them and breaking up with them
2402960	2403960	and having my heart broke,
2403960	2405960	and she's scouring all that stuff
2405960	2408960	and picking the good stuff from the bad stuff.
2408960	2410960	And all of it is just me,
2410960	2412960	you got a big narcissistic rant,
2412960	2417960	and there are girlfriends that would justifiably go,
2417960	2419960	I don't want to reward this.
2419960	2422960	He needs to come down a couple notches.
2422960	2425960	But it's like that arm wrestling thing,
2425960	2428960	you just go with the force.
2428960	2432960	She's celebrating my ego for my birthday.
2432960	2434960	I walked into my living room,
2434960	2437960	and she had gathered 60 of my finest friends,
2437960	2439960	and they all did selected readings of this book
2439960	2442960	that I didn't know I had written until that moment.
2442960	2444960	And then they all had me sign it,
2444960	2446960	and it was like this narcissist's dream.
2446960	2448960	It was a perfect birthday party.
2448960	2450960	I read through it, and when I saw it,
2450960	2452960	I've read most of it,
2452960	2453960	because I've known you a long time,
2453960	2456960	and I've read emails or blog entries or things like that.
2456960	2458960	It's really cool to go back and,
2458960	2463960	this is a chronology of your mania and your life.
2463960	2467960	So here's the weird side effect of it.
2467960	2469960	So people are excited about it.
2469960	2471960	There's Darren Harmon fans online.
2471960	2473960	There's 900 copies of this thing.
2473960	2477960	She's gonna sell them during a limited time.
2477960	2480960	I have to try to find this.
2480960	2482960	Can anyone, can someone in the audience
2482960	2484960	that has a phone that I'll be able to read
2484960	2486960	so that I'm not trying to multitask,
2486960	2489960	bring up the, if you can find it,
2489960	2496960	the Onion AV Club article that is about the book.
2496960	2498960	Is that enough information to find it?
2498960	2501960	Whoever's got it first that can hand me their phone,
2501960	2504960	bring it up, and I'm looking at it.
2504960	2506960	Aaron texted me.
2506960	2509960	The Onion AV Club, they posted an article about the book.
2509960	2511960	It's like getting, oh wow, that's great.
2511960	2512960	That's really great news.
2512960	2514960	I went to look at it just to verify that that's the case.
2514960	2516960	And then why do I always do this?
2516960	2518960	Scroll down to the comment section.
2518960	2519960	No!
2519960	2521960	No!
2521960	2523960	I thought that I was impervious.
2523960	2528960	But this is, it is brutal for me.
2528960	2531960	But I also think my definition of stuff that hurts
2531960	2533960	is so different from other people's.
2533960	2538960	What ratio of being bashed to being praised?
2538960	2539960	That was the other thing.
2539960	2541960	It felt like it was just this unilateral fucking like,
2541960	2542960	fuck this guy.
2542960	2545960	Why does he want me to buy his book?
2545960	2550960	Sean has a phone for you, Dan.
2550960	2551960	All right.
2551960	2552960	You could give yours to Jeff,
2552960	2555960	and he could maybe pick a couple tasty ones.
2555960	2560960	So they do, I just want to like, all right.
2560960	2562960	I'm just going down to the comment section, you mean?
2562960	2563960	Yeah.
2563960	2568960	I'm going to stop at the ones that really, really hurt me.
2568960	2569960	Ooh.
2569960	2570960	So the first one goes...
2570960	2571960	Can I start with one?
2571960	2572960	Okay, go ahead.
2572960	2575960	All proceeds will go toward getting Mr. Harmon
2575960	2578960	a shower and a clean shirt.
2578960	2583960	That's not, that's a fan.
2584960	2586960	No, the one underneath it.
2586960	2590960	And an autographed, self-taken photo of Dan Harmon crying,
2590960	2593960	lamenting why you couldn't just let him be great.
2593960	2596960	That hurts.
2596960	2600960	Okay, I've gone through seven ones that were not so bad.
2600960	2605960	Let's see.
2605960	2606960	Well, you know, then there's ones that are just like,
2606960	2609960	I don't give a shit about the collected online writings of Dan Harmon.
2609960	2610960	That's fine, but why type that?
2610960	2611960	What are you doing?
2612960	2614960	Do you understand how the internet works?
2614960	2619960	Like, why are you on this page?
2619960	2621960	So that person says that,
2621960	2623960	and then that serves as a route for a bunch of people to chime in,
2623960	2624960	replying to that person,
2624960	2627960	this person who doesn't give a shit about my collected online writings.
2627960	2629960	This person says, don't worry,
2629960	2632960	Dan Harmon cares enough about the collective works of Dan Harmon,
2632960	2635960	enough for all of us.
2635960	2637960	By all of us, I mean everyone who existed in the past,
2637960	2638960	everyone currently alive,
2638960	2641960	and everyone who will ever enter this mortal coil.
2641960	2645960	By the way, that one hurts after he says mortal coil,
2645960	2649960	because it's like, nice try, self-styled Dan Harmon.
2649960	2652960	Gee, I wonder where this is coming from.
2652960	2654960	Well, here's one that's all caps,
2654960	2656960	and this one is pretty succinct.
2656960	2661960	The collected online writings of Dan Harmon sucks.
2661960	2663960	Yeah, that doesn't.
2663960	2667960	Dan Harmon's next project will be a delightfully quirky sitcom
2667960	2671960	about a delightfully quirky group of six to eight delightfully quirky friends
2671960	2674960	who hang out in acting delightfully quirky send-ups of various movies and TV shows
2674960	2676960	while yelling at everyone with an earshot
2676960	2681960	that their vision is too beautiful and unique for this dark and savage world.
2681960	2687960	So now our crime is wanting people to be happy?
2687960	2689960	And by ours, I mean mine.
2690960	2692960	I just...
2692960	2693960	Let's see.
2693960	2694960	Sorry, while you look, Dan.
2694960	2697960	Sorry, I got this note, and this is good stuff.
2697960	2702960	There is an orange scion blocking someone that needs to move right now behind the store.
2702960	2703960	The end.
2703960	2704960	An orange scion.
2704960	2707960	This is a car that looks like a roller skate.
2707960	2710960	I'll probably stop with this one, because this one is...
2710960	2712960	Dan, may I share one?
2712960	2713960	Jesus.
2713960	2716960	Jesus Christ.
2716960	2720960	The ghost of Christmas presents.
2720960	2721960	Adam Goldberg.
2721960	2722960	I'm Jewish.
2722960	2723960	I don't get Christmas presents.
2723960	2725960	Did you just, like, materialize there?
2725960	2730960	I was here for at least 53 seconds.
2730960	2737960	My angst floated off of me, and the cloud formed into...
2737960	2739960	All right, what were you going to...
2739960	2740960	This is a bunch of stuff.
2740960	2743960	Sue's chef shares that maybe he's morphing into Scud,
2743960	2747960	and Jim Trafficint responds, seriously...
2747960	2750960	Those Orson Welles-level bags in that drawing,
2750960	2753960	maybe he had Harmon sit for the drawing after a week-long bender of shame
2753960	2755960	as comedy writers are prone to.
2755960	2756960	These guys are mean.
2756960	2757960	That doesn't offend me.
2757960	2760960	That's just calling me a comedy writer and saying that I'm dedicated to my work.
2760960	2761960	But then someone says...
2761960	2764960	That's why my best friend drew baggy eyes on me.
2764960	2765960	He knew that I'd be flattered by it.
2765960	2769960	I like being a fucking slob and a maniac.
2769960	2774960	What I don't like is people implying that I think that they should like me.
2774960	2776960	That's what gets me.
2776960	2778960	That's the weird thing I wanted to talk about,
2778960	2780960	that I discovered rereading through this.
2780960	2783960	My soft spot is pretense.
2783960	2785960	If you want to know how to really hurt me,
2785960	2788960	it's the idea that I think that I'm special.
2788960	2789960	Because I don't...
2789960	2791960	And I think it's because of my brother.
2791960	2793960	I think it's growing up under my brother,
2793960	2796960	who no longer listens to the podcast, hopefully.
2796960	2798960	And if he does, fuck him.
2798960	2801960	Because he got really mad about me telling stories about him that were pretty bad.
2801960	2802960	Glad to help with that, by the way.
2802960	2803960	He was a dick.
2803960	2804960	Jesus Christ.
2810960	2814960	People are mean to you on the internet because you're not me.
2814960	2817960	If you go to harmontown.com, which you should all do at this show,
2817960	2820960	it's unanimous that I am the hero.
2820960	2821960	Everyone's like, I love Goldberg.
2821960	2823960	He's scrappy and Dan is mean.
2823960	2828960	What the fuck is going on?
2828960	2831960	He's rounded the bend into hamburger territory.
2831960	2837960	He's embracing his role as our product's spokes villain.
2837960	2840960	I want harmontown, rabble rabble.
2840960	2842960	No, get away from there, Goldberg.
2842960	2844960	No, I love it.
2844960	2848960	Harmontown is for humans, silly Goldberg.
2848960	2850960	It's like at a ski show.
2850960	2852960	Look out, Cindy.
2852960	2854960	Goldberg's behind you.
2854960	2859960	Well, I thought it's more like I dress up every week like Barney Rubble
2859960	2864960	and try and steal the fruity pebbles of your self-respect.
2864960	2866960	Yes.
2866960	2867960	Precisely.
2867960	2869960	Yes, that's another example.
2869960	2875960	Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam.
2875960	2878960	Shut the fuck up, Adam.
2879960	2880960	I don't care what you're holding.
2880960	2882960	I don't care what's in your hand.
2882960	2884960	I'm going to control you right now.
2884960	2887960	You're either rapping or you're getting off the stage.
2887960	2888960	Give me beat number one.
2888960	2890960	All right, beat it around.
2896960	2899960	Boom, going to wrap it up, Goldberg style.
2899960	2901960	Yeah, going to take a while.
2901960	2903960	Dan, thanks for the podcast.
2903960	2906960	I've had a lot of fun with the people that I just chant.
2906960	2907960	Wrap about and I'll say this.
2907960	2908960	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
2908960	2909960	Let's hear it for him.
2909960	2910960	Wasn't he great?
2910960	2911960	I brought you a board game.
2911960	2912960	Let's hear it for him.
2912960	2913960	Let's hear it for him.
2913960	2918960	Guest Department Town, stay at the Studio City Marriott.
2918960	2919960	I got a card for Eric Idle.
2919960	2920960	I thought this would be a good fit.
2920960	2921960	All right.
2921960	2924960	Adam Goldberg's clothing by Dolce & Gabbana.
2924960	2926960	One more time for Adam Goldberg, everybody.
2926960	2927960	All right.
2930960	2932960	I just wanted to re-
2932960	2934960	It kind of got derailed.
2934960	2935960	You don't sell how?
2935960	2936960	No.
2936960	2937960	You don't fucking say.
2937960	2941960	It's just because Adam becoming more and more terrifying.
2941960	2944960	Now I'm worried for my own safety.
2944960	2945960	Yeah.
2948960	2950960	The last thing I see before I die is going to be, I'm going to wake up.
2950960	2952960	It's going to be him with a butcher knife.
2952960	2954960	Well, you just saw how easy it was.
2954960	2955960	There was a-
2955960	2957960	He just was a poof, he was there.
2957960	2962960	There was an ending of a law and order where they went toe to toe with this really vicious prison gang.
2963960	2966960	And everyone was really intimidated by them, jurors and stuff like that.
2966960	2968960	But they pursued the case and they won for justice.
2968960	2971960	And then the epilogue of the law and order episode is they're on the streets of New York.
2971960	2974960	And the ADA is walking and getting a hot dog.
2974960	2976960	And some guy in tattoos comes up next to her and goes,
2976960	2978960	Excuse me, are you so-and-so?
2978960	2979960	And she goes, Yeah.
2979960	2982960	And he goes, You can tell your boss we were this close.
2982960	2983960	And he walks away.
2983960	2986960	And it just leaves on her going, Ooh, ooh, ooh.
2986960	2989960	And Goldberg was that close.
2989960	2990960	I didn't know.
2990960	2991960	Yeah.
2991960	2994960	Like, there will be no warning.
2994960	2995960	He'll be in your back seat.
2995960	2999960	Does he have the thing, like the little taxi driver gun thing?
2999960	3000960	I don't know.
3000960	3004960	I feel like he'll be more like an X-Files biological weapon.
3004960	3009960	Like, turn out that one of his hands is a lizard hand or something.
3011960	3014960	Do you think it's time to bring up Spencer?
3014960	3015960	Yes.
3015960	3016960	I just wanted to read this one last thing.
3016960	3017960	But now that I got all interrupted, it feels like,
3017960	3020960	Oh, then Dan had spent this episode dwelling on comment sections.
3020960	3022960	But I just wanted it to be one thing.
3022960	3024960	But I wanted to close with this one.
3024960	3026960	I don't know whether this one hurts or not.
3026960	3029960	But it definitely affects me.
3029960	3035960	So collected works, Herman's sex, blah, blah, blah.
3035960	3036960	People are responding.
3036960	3039960	And then a guy says, Yeah, I've gone from loving him and community
3039960	3042960	to hating him and loving community.
3042960	3043960	That's really sad.
3043960	3044960	All right.
3044960	3045960	I don't know why.
3045960	3046960	Now I read that out loud.
3046960	3048960	It seems like that's what I wanted.
3048960	3049960	Well, you got it.
3049960	3050960	Yeah.
3050960	3052960	It's not really what I wanted.
3052960	3054960	I wanted to explore it because you guys are my therapist.
3054960	3055960	That's all.
3055960	3056960	I just wanted to say it out loud.
3056960	3060960	And it kind of hit me in the solar plexus like reading those comments.
3060960	3061960	And I was texting Aaron about it.
3061960	3063960	And I was like, What the fuck is going on?
3063960	3064960	Why am I so affected by this?
3064960	3068960	I'm so shielded in places where everybody usually kicks.
3068960	3072960	You know, and then this weird shit gets me.
3072960	3075960	And it has something to do with, I think I had an epiphany in my car
3075960	3076960	sorting through it.
3076960	3079960	It has something to do with needing other people's approval,
3079960	3080960	which is a dadoi.
3080960	3084960	But like, I'm 40 years old.
3084960	3091960	I am allowed to now become a dispenser of happiness.
3091960	3096960	I can't expect to get it like fed to me like a baby bird anymore.
3096960	3099960	Emotionally, you know, you have to grow up a little bit.
3099960	3101960	I can still be insecure and express my anxieties and stuff.
3101960	3104960	But there is, you know, the people that write that shit,
3104960	3107960	they don't expect my dumb fat ass to be like scrolling through it
3107960	3111960	and then go, they wouldn't they wouldn't really want to have an impact
3111960	3112960	on a human being.
3112960	3114960	They're just screaming at the sky.
3114960	3117960	Notice me like no one in particular.
3117960	3120960	Like I know they're talking to themselves.
3120960	3121960	I disagree.
3121960	3123960	I think they actually do think I think not all of us.
3123960	3124960	Adam always does this shit.
3124960	3125960	He hands you shit.
3125960	3127960	And then like it was a plate of cookies last night.
3127960	3129960	Now it's a gift to give me a board game.
3129960	3132960	I put a hazmat suit on that's anthrax all the way.
3133960	3134960	Whose was this?
3134960	3135960	Over here.
3135960	3136960	This is Sean's, right?
3136960	3137960	Thank you, Sean.
3137960	3141960	Oh, Sean, Sean, Sean, his own built in reminder.
3141960	3143960	I had written it down, but I might have forgotten.
3143960	3145960	Sean, thank you for your wonderful birthday gift.
3145960	3147960	I'm assuming it was our New Year's gift.
3147960	3149960	Maybe a Christmas gift.
3149960	3152960	Podcast got pretty boring.
3152960	3157960	When Dan started counting the number of ways something could be a gift.
3157960	3160960	That's when I checked out, said the three hundred and eightieth person
3160960	3161960	crammed in the back corner.
3161960	3164960	Let's say it's time to kick the show into overdrive.
3164960	3167960	You have other thoughts apparently.
3167960	3168960	No, no, no.
3168960	3169960	You mean Spencer Drive?
3169960	3170960	Yeah, Spencer Drive.
3170960	3171960	Yeah, let's do it.
3171960	3172960	Anybody know a guy named Spencer?
3172960	3174960	He's our dungeon master.
3181960	3184960	Spencer, you have a new musical theme.
3184960	3186960	Is that what this is?
3186960	3189960	This is the new Spencer theme.
3189960	3192960	Oh, we have our own legally clearable Spencer theme.
3192960	3195960	This is called Spencer Intro.
3195960	3197960	All right, Spencer's our dungeon master.
3197960	3199960	Those of you just tuning in, we love and adore him.
3199960	3201960	We found him out of our own audience.
3201960	3205960	And Spencer is going to take off on it.
3205960	3207960	Actually, it occurs to me, Spencer, I know nothing about you.
3207960	3210960	Are you going to leave a job behind as you come on tour with us?
3210960	3213960	Yeah, I work at an Apple store near my house,
3213960	3214960	and I work in the back.
3214960	3216960	I count boxes.
3216960	3218960	It's fun.
3219960	3221960	So you got a furlough.
3221960	3223960	You get to come on leave with Harmon Town,
3223960	3225960	and he's going to be on the tour bus with us,
3225960	3230960	dungeon mastering every dungeon that we try to enter.
3234960	3237960	Did any of that Patton Oswalt horror stories in Phoenix,
3237960	3239960	were you at all, Spencer?
3239960	3243960	I don't want to die in a jackknife.
3243960	3245960	Yeah, that's always my thing.
3245960	3250960	Big tour bus accident.
3250960	3252960	That's pretty ignominious.
3252960	3253960	That's no good.
3253960	3255960	All right.
3255960	3256960	I leveled up, you guys.
3256960	3258960	I got new gadgets and stuff.
3258960	3259960	Bear with me.
3259960	3261960	Our dungeon master leveled up.
3261960	3262960	So you got a new iPad.
3262960	3266960	Did you find that in the back room of the store, Spencer?
3266960	3271960	Yeah, I mean, we just sometimes we count less.
3276960	3278960	Did you guys write that?
3278960	3280960	Oh yeah, Spencer and I hang out all the time.
3280960	3281960	Write bits.
3281960	3283960	We were riding bikes the other day.
3283960	3284960	So Spencer, I hear you.
3284960	3288960	Spencer, I hear something funny happened to Trader Joe's yesterday.
3288960	3292960	Oh yeah, you know me and traders.
3292960	3293960	That one needs work.
3293960	3294960	We got to work on that one.
3294960	3295960	Sorry.
3295960	3296960	There's a workshop on that one.
3296960	3299960	Speaking of workshops, we should bring up an improviser
3299960	3301960	to help us play Dungeons and Dragons.
3301960	3304960	We decided that the cavalcade of stars wasn't quite complete yet.
3304960	3307960	We're going to bring up somebody who's never played D&D before.
3307960	3308960	He's going to fill in.
3308960	3311960	And maybe in some guest star role that Spencer has created,
3311960	3314960	this person knows nothing of D&D, has never ever played it.
3314960	3315960	But maybe you know him.
3315960	3317960	Television's Ryan Stiles.
3334960	3344960	I have to sit down because I've had so much of this sweet, sweet liquor tea.
3344960	3345960	I think that's very nice.
3345960	3347960	You quit drinking because of your girlfriend?
3347960	3348960	Well, no.
3348960	3349960	So sweet.
3349960	3350960	So sweet.
3350960	3354960	And give it a month.
3354960	3356960	It's very odd that you stopped drinking because of her
3356960	3360960	and yet I'm backstage doing lines off her tits.
3360960	3363960	That's so weird.
3363960	3364960	That's better you don't know.
3364960	3366960	I think they were her tits.
3366960	3367960	Hi.
3367960	3368960	You think they were her tits?
3368960	3369960	Hey, are you...
3369960	3372960	Are you...
3372960	3377960	I hope so.
3377960	3378960	Go on, Ryan.
3378960	3381960	Otherwise, there are two perfectly formed moles together.
3381960	3382960	I'm good.
3382960	3384960	Are you going on tour with Jeff?
3384960	3385960	Have you toured with Jeff before?
3385960	3386960	No, no.
3386960	3388960	See, I've toured with Jeff for a number of years.
3388960	3389960	Oh, do you have any...
3389960	3390960	Are you on a bus?
3390960	3391960	Yes.
3391960	3394960	For two or three hours a day of retarded Elvis.
3394960	3396960	Jeff, do a little retarded Elvis for us.
3396960	3398960	I have a couple stock characters.
3398960	3400960	Do a little retarded Elvis for us today.
3400960	3403960	Hi, Rosa.
3403960	3405960	Hi.
3405960	3406960	It's just a retarded Elvis.
3406960	3407960	No, more.
3407960	3408960	Do more, though.
3408960	3409960	Do more of it.
3409960	3411960	Hi, Rosa.
3411960	3414960	Hi, Rosa.
3414960	3415960	Three hours.
3415960	3416960	It's okay.
3416960	3417960	Three hours.
3417960	3419960	Dan, the thing is...
3419960	3421960	And I mean, I'm in a bunk in the bed.
3421960	3423960	He'll open the curtain and start doing that.
3423960	3424960	Are you...
3424960	3425960	Yes, Jeff.
3425960	3426960	I'm lonesome tonight, yes.
3426960	3427960	Thank you.
3427960	3430960	The thing is, retarded Elvis isn't funny for the first hour.
3430960	3431960	No.
3431960	3432960	No, you have to keep it up.
3432960	3433960	Second hour, great.
3433960	3434960	Yeah.
3434960	3435960	Third hour, it goes into a bit of a trough.
3435960	3436960	Yeah.
3436960	3437960	But it's going to be fun for you.
3437960	3438960	Yeah.
3438960	3439960	Is your girlfriend staying here?
3439960	3440960	Or is she going with you?
3440960	3442960	She's coming with Ryan.
3442960	3443960	She is?
3443960	3444960	So you're not drinking the entire tour, then?
3444960	3446960	Oh, I thought you were asking because you wanted to do more co-coffers.
3446960	3447960	No, no, no, no.
3447960	3448960	I'm moving on.
3448960	3449960	No, no.
3449960	3450960	She's not sober.
3450960	3451960	We're just cleansing for four days.
3451960	3452960	That's great.
3452960	3453960	We're going to...
3453960	3454960	What was the green stuff you were drinking backstage?
3454960	3456960	It was kale, celery, spinach, cucumber...
3456960	3457960	That's fantastic.
3457960	3459960	This is vodka and cranberry.
3459960	3464960	Is there a cup back there, anybody?
3464960	3466960	More kale for Dan, please.
3466960	3467960	No, no, no.
3467960	3468960	More kale.
3468960	3469960	You just flung a craving on me.
3469960	3471960	I'm going to have some vodka, too.
3471960	3474960	Ask for vodka as retarded Elvis, please, would you?
3475960	3476960	Oh, I can't have a vodka.
3483960	3484960	That's fantastic.
3484960	3485960	Four hours, three hours.
3485960	3486960	The thing about tour...
3486960	3487960	I should have asked Pat in this.
3487960	3493960	The thing about tour bus comedy is that after a while, the level of comedy goes just lower
3493960	3496960	and lower and lower, and then it becomes almost a challenge.
3496960	3498960	Who can do the basest comedy?
3498960	3500960	Who can be the most adolescent?
3500960	3503960	It's like a game of chicken with...
3503960	3505960	I'm doing two and a half men with Pat in this week.
3505960	3506960	Oh, yeah?
3506960	3507960	Not very funny.
3508960	3509960	Surprising.
3509960	3510960	He stole the show up here.
3510960	3511960	He's gone.
3511960	3512960	That's why I said that.
3512960	3513960	What's his character?
3513960	3514960	I was going to...
3514960	3515960	If he didn't leave, I have it on my iPhone.
3515960	3516960	I have the script.
3516960	3517960	I was going to get us to do the scene from...
3517960	3518960	Oh, yeah.
3518960	3520960	They're doing two and a half men together, and...
3520960	3521960	Not together.
3521960	3523960	I'm never aware anybody else is there, really.
3523960	3524960	Oh, really?
3526960	3528960	We were going to do a run through of our scene.
3528960	3530960	Since Charlie left, you know, it's not...
3530960	3531960	How's the show?
3531960	3532960	Is it funny now with Aston?
3532960	3533960	Is it good?
3547960	3549960	I shouldn't have had this much to drink.
3549960	3550960	You're having so much fun.
3550960	3552960	There goes my medical.
3552960	3555960	So I have to leave at some point right in the middle of...
3555960	3557960	Or toward like the latter...
3557960	3560960	Like two-thirds of the tour, I leave Harman Town
3560960	3562960	to go do shows with you and Greg.
3562960	3564960	Yeah, it's a little scary to have Jeff on the road.
3564960	3566960	We were in some small town in Canada,
3566960	3569960	and I think it was a bikini bronco riding that night?
3569960	3570960	Yeah, bikini bull riding.
3570960	3573960	And he walked in in a suit in...
3573960	3575960	It was Kamloops, British Columbia,
3575960	3579960	and there was a marquee in front of a place called Cactus Jacks,
3579960	3581960	and it boasted of...
3581960	3582960	Jeff always thinks he's in L.A.
3582960	3583960	Bikini bull riding.
3583960	3585960	And I walked in, I said, I'm going to go in there,
3585960	3586960	and someone that lived there was like,
3586960	3588960	no, you don't want to go to Cactus Jacks.
3588960	3589960	It's pretty...
3589960	3590960	You're wearing the only suit in town.
3590960	3591960	So I came in, I walked in in a suit,
3591960	3594960	and there was a bar that had a metal detector,
3594960	3596960	and there was a bin, like the little trays
3596960	3597960	that you get at the airport.
3597960	3599960	And in the tray were shivs.
3599960	3602960	There were screwdrivers and homemade knives.
3602960	3604960	Some people have a weekend leave.
3604960	3606960	But the beauty was, like,
3606960	3608960	well, we'll take your sharpened screwdriver
3608960	3610960	and we'll give it with duct tape for the handle,
3610960	3611960	and we'll leave it here.
3611960	3613960	You get it when you get out, when you leave,
3613960	3615960	you can get your shiv back.
3615960	3617960	How long have you been dating this girl?
3617960	3619960	A year, really.
3619960	3621960	Right on the nugget.
3621960	3623960	Our first kiss was Christmas Day.
3623960	3625960	Wow.
3625960	3627960	Jesus' birthday, that's great.
3627960	3629960	Yeah, and then I stared.
3629960	3632960	It's still exciting and everything.
3632960	3633960	How old is she and how old are you?
3633960	3635960	I'm just curious.
3635960	3638960	She just turned 28 and I just turned 40.
3638960	3639960	Wow.
3639960	3641960	That's interesting.
3641960	3643960	Do you have 40 now?
3643960	3645960	Really, you have 40 to look for.
3645960	3647960	You still look at your penis in the mirror?
3647960	3649960	I don't know.
3649960	3650960	I tried to...
3650960	3651960	I don't know.
3651960	3653960	Stop doing that at some point.
3653960	3654960	It's like my high school yearbook.
3654960	3655960	I know I have one.
3655960	3657960	I just never, ever look at it.
3657960	3659960	I look at my body naked all the time.
3659960	3660960	Do you really?
3660960	3664960	Yeah, but my penis is just like another nipple down there.
3664960	3667960	Some people are growers and some people are showers.
3668960	3670960	I'm a retractor.
3670960	3674960	I'm on Mars exploration equipment.
3674960	3676960	You just look down there.
3676960	3678960	You know what helps me?
3678960	3680960	Golden Girls reruns.
3684960	3689960	Ryan, do you know anything about D&D at all?
3689960	3691960	No, I have a life.
3697960	3699960	He's right. Don't boo him.
3699960	3701960	He knows what I'm talking about.
3701960	3703960	Ryan, you might be beloved outside of Nerd Mel,
3703960	3705960	but in here Spencer is kind of a Golden God.
3705960	3707960	I don't care.
3709960	3711960	Spencer, if you would...
3711960	3713960	How does this work? I have no idea.
3713960	3717960	Spencer right now will give you a little intro to bring us...
3717960	3718960	Dan and I...
3718960	3720960	Is it important I know about this game?
3720960	3723960	Am I going to fuck this up or do I need to know specifics?
3723960	3725960	Have you ever done bad improv before?
3725960	3726960	It's just like that.
3726960	3728960	It's all I do.
3728960	3730960	I work at Drew Carey.
3731960	3733960	No way to avoid it.
3735960	3737960	Is he here? Fuck off. He's not here.
3739960	3742960	Hey Ryan, remember when Drew used to be two and a half men?
3742960	3744960	Yes, I do.
3748960	3752960	When we last met, our heroes had just defeated Lord Butzalot
3752960	3755960	who attacked the adventurers in a fit of rage.
3755960	3757960	After Lord Mango had fallen,
3757960	3760960	his barbarian tribesmen came out of hiding.
3760960	3763960	They thanked Sharpie for quelling Lord Butzalot's wrath,
3763960	3766960	then woke up the barbaric Paterfamilius.
3766960	3768960	Mango came too in a confused daze,
3768960	3770960	first ornery and eager to fight.
3770960	3771960	Mango's his dad.
3771960	3774960	But then more understanding and apologetic of his prior behavior.
3774960	3776960	Revealing his true intentions,
3776960	3778960	the Warchief explained the powerful effects
3778960	3780960	of the magical fragments of power
3780960	3782960	and their role in the formation of the multiverse.
3783960	3786960	In a fit of madness,
3786960	3788960	the Great Lord snatched up his red stone
3788960	3791960	and swallowed it in one single confusing gulp.
3793960	3795960	This odd gesture can't help but remind you
3795960	3798960	of Admiral Darkstar, that black garbed awkward fellow
3798960	3801960	from the ziggurat, that evil malevolence who swore to steal
3801960	3804960	and destroy your planet with the power of the fragments.
3806960	3809960	Just then, the party heard the unmistakable sound
3809960	3811960	of an approaching horse-drawn cavern.
3812960	3814960	Ok...
3818960	3820960	Alright.
3821960	3823960	I need my character sheet.
3823960	3825460	Yes, dispense the character sheets.
3825460	3827960	Oh shit, I'm sorry. I thought we were starting.
3827960	3828960	No, we-
3828960	3830960	I wasted that horse.
3830960	3833960	Tonight, the roll of the horse will be played by Ryan Styles.
3833960	3835960	That was a three-legged horse by the way.
3836960	3837960	Dan, did you get mine?
3837960	3840960	Yes, just sorting them out.
3840960	3841960	Don't mix them up.
3841960	3844960	Ryan, my name is Quark and he's Sharpie.
3844960	3845960	Alright.
3845960	3849960	He's a human magic user. I'm a gnome barbarian.
3849960	3851960	I've noticed you guys get papers and I have shit.
3851960	3853960	You have this one here.
3853960	3855960	The fuck this is an improv?
3855960	3857960	What the fuck is this?
3862960	3865960	I've had this thing for four months. I have no idea what's going on.
3865960	3867960	It's a fucking fantasy football here or something.
3868960	3874960	I always kind of stare at it and the information never makes it all the way into my brain.
3874960	3876960	There's other things going on.
3876960	3878960	Alright, Spencer, what are our surroundings right now?
3878960	3884960	You're in the wreckage of that Knoll camp where you fought Lord Butzalot.
3884960	3887960	And is he still-
3887960	3890960	Lord Butzalot's still with you. He's still with the barbarians.
3890960	3892960	You guys were just having a nice chat.
3892960	3895960	He ate one of those things and you guys were like, what?
3896960	3898960	He ate one of the fragments.
3898960	3900960	What was the advice?
3900960	3903960	We had some people from the audience help us out.
3903960	3906960	There was advice about that one fragment that he'd eaten, right?
3906960	3910960	Somebody said cast a tech magic and then we-
3910960	3912960	You do this every week?
3912960	3913960	Yeah.
3913960	3915960	And it carries on? It's like a-
3915960	3918960	We killed a giant piggy bank.
3918960	3920960	A cube of jello.
3920960	3921960	A cube of jello, yeah.
3921960	3923960	You guys should get cable.
3925960	3928960	We detected some shards in his stomach and then that was a big revelation.
3928960	3930960	So we have some of the shards, right?
3930960	3932960	You have two shards, yes.
3932960	3934960	And my dad ate one and walked away.
3934960	3937960	And now you're hearing an approaching wagon.
3937960	3941960	Alright, so I look at what the wagon is.
3942960	3943960	You look to the-
3943960	3945960	Although I have my guesses.
3945960	3947960	I think it's a wagon.
3948960	3951960	You're not sure why a caravan would come here of all places,
3951960	3954960	the ruins of a newly destroyed Knoll encampment.
3954960	3958960	You hear the gruff gravelly voice from inside a cart call out.
3958960	3961960	Welcome to Alooaf's Wonder Wagon.
3961960	3965960	The cart screeches to a halt about 15 feet away from you.
3967960	3970960	And its wooden panels collapse outwards,
3970960	3973960	revealing an equally questionable decorated storefront.
3973960	3980960	You see food, crafts, supplies, materials, leather goods, tools, clothing, weapons, jewels,
3980960	3983960	and all manner of assorted knick-knacks and curios.
3984960	3987960	And before you stands, presumably Olaf,
3987960	3991960	a halfling with a large turban and an orange mustache.
3992960	3993960	That's you.
3993960	3994960	Oh.
3995960	3997960	Alright, so you're playing a shopkeeper.
3997960	3998960	Here's your thing.
3998960	4000960	I wrote a list of things you sell on the back,
4000960	4002960	but you can also sell other things.
4002960	4003960	Oh, okay.
4009960	4010960	Good day to you, sir.
4010960	4011960	Good day.
4014960	4015960	Yeah.
4018960	4019960	Tell me what you seek.
4019960	4020960	I have a long list.
4022960	4024960	Well, we are adventurers and we are...
4024960	4027960	our satchels are filled with treasures and gold.
4027960	4028960	Ah, and you need nothing for me.
4028960	4029960	Your satchels are full.
4033960	4034960	Do you have any cigarettes?
4034960	4035960	Cigarettes.
4035960	4036960	Let me check.
4037960	4041960	No, but I do have a healing pendant and a portable hole.
4044960	4045960	Yes, yes.
4045960	4048960	The portable hole is $40, same as downtown.
4062960	4063960	Well, I'm kind of at a loss.
4063960	4064960	I don't really...
4064960	4066960	I'm not really in a shopping mood, but...
4066960	4069960	Spencer, is there anything in our inventory that we lack
4069960	4072960	that this shopkeeper might give us?
4072960	4074960	Well, that depends on what you want, you know?
4076960	4078960	If you have anything weird, you could ask him about it.
4078960	4080960	You could ask questions.
4080960	4083960	A shopkeeper, what do you give the gnome barbarian
4083960	4084960	that has everything?
4085960	4088960	Might I say that bull strength is on sale this week.
4090960	4091960	How much is the bull strength?
4091960	4092960	Three for $49.
4093960	4095960	Three for $49?
4095960	4097960	I can get two for $50 downtown.
4097960	4098960	Oh, that's bull.
4099960	4100960	I'm selling bull strength.
4103960	4104960	What does that...
4104960	4106960	Oh, I do have smoke sticks.
4106960	4108960	Did you come seeking cigarettes?
4108960	4109960	I love cigarettes.
4109960	4110960	I have smoke sticks.
4110960	4111960	I think they're similar.
4113960	4114960	Do you have menthol?
4116960	4119960	I don't, but I could give you some ice.
4120960	4122960	Suck in some ice and then have a...
4123960	4125960	Spencer, what do smoke sticks do?
4125960	4128960	Smoke sticks release an acrid smoke that creates a
4128960	4131960	smoke screen for a short period of time, obscuring vision.
4131960	4132960	Cigarettes.
4136960	4139960	Yet you may not take them to the land of Calabasas.
4143960	4145960	I'll take a carton of smoke sticks.
4145960	4146960	A carton of smoke sticks for you.
4146960	4148960	And with that I throw in a free illusion.
4149960	4150960	A free illusion?
4150960	4151960	A free illusion.
4151960	4152960	What does that mean Spencer?
4152960	4153960	I won't know until it happens.
4154960	4156960	Tell me what you see.
4156960	4158960	It's not like dove from lit candle.
4158960	4159960	Is it one of those kind of crappy things?
4159960	4160960	You've been here before.
4161960	4164960	Wait, that was your portable home?
4164960	4165960	Yes, of course.
4167960	4168960	What's a portable home?
4169960	4171960	Famous downtown, $40.
4176960	4181960	I want to show Olaf the shards, if you know what I mean.
4182960	4188960	And see if he's heard any tell of their origins or any rumors about them.
4190960	4192960	Take a look at these magic shards, Olaf.
4193960	4194960	Oh, the magic shards.
4195960	4196960	You bring these to me?
4197960	4198960	Well, I'm not giving them to you.
4198960	4199960	I'm showing them to you.
4199960	4200960	What are they shards of?
4201960	4204960	Something, some force of power.
4204960	4205960	I don't really know.
4205960	4206960	What are the shards of Spencer?
4207960	4208960	The shards.
4208960	4213960	Olaf doesn't know much about the shards, but he knows their value is beyond compare.
4213960	4219960	He would offer to buy them, although he knows there's no price that you'd willingly take for such a valuable artifact.
4219960	4221960	I will buy those from you.
4223960	4224960	Name your price.
4225960	4229960	I don't think there's any price for which we'd part with them.
4229960	4232960	But there has to be a reason that this man has come across our path.
4232960	4235960	I believe that everything has faded to be Sharpie.
4235960	4237960	Jesus, all right.
4240960	4245960	I mean, come up with a price you're going to get caught with a shitload of shards that you can't get rid of.
4246960	4249960	Spencer, how many shards do we need to have a full set?
4249960	4251960	You don't know. There's no way of knowing.
4251960	4255960	We have two, and Sharpie's dad, Mango, has one in his stomach right now.
4255960	4257960	Yeah, and a few, I think.
4257960	4260960	Can we follow Mango around until he poops and go through it and find one of them?
4260960	4264960	You could potentially do that. He's standing in the foreground.
4264960	4265960	Oh.
4265960	4266960	Hi.
4266960	4268960	You're going to need a portable hole for that.
4273960	4274960	What's the portable hole?
4274960	4277960	Portable holes are these fabric circles.
4277960	4280960	So like if you took this and cut it into a circle, like a circle of fabric,
4280960	4284960	you throw it on the ground and it becomes a real hole, like a 10-foot pit or something.
4284960	4285960	So you could hide it?
4285960	4286960	Yeah, and then you could pick it up.
4286960	4290960	So you could, you know, drop your friend down there and pick it up and take him and put him in a wall.
4290960	4291960	And he'll fall outside.
4291960	4292960	And how tall is Olaf?
4292960	4295960	Olaf would be about four feet tall.
4295960	4296960	I thought Olaf was big.
4296960	4297960	Olaf is a halfling.
4297960	4298960	Halflings are very small.
4298960	4300960	So two halflings is worth...
4301960	4304960	Depends on where your exchange rates are.
4304960	4306960	Two men and a halfling.
4307960	4309960	How much for the portable hole?
4309960	4312960	Is it really, it's 50 gold pieces?
4312960	4313960	What is it?
4313960	4315960	$40, same as downtown's.
4315960	4318960	Yet I will take one shard of glass for your whole portable hole.
4318960	4320960	I don't want to part with the shards.
4320960	4322960	We've got to hang on to the shards.
4322960	4324960	What are so important about these shards?
4324960	4325960	We don't know.
4325960	4327960	And yet you want to hang on to them.
4327960	4328960	Yes.
4329960	4331960	I mean, why do you want them so bad?
4331960	4333960	I haven't any in my wagon.
4334960	4337960	What if someone else were to ask me for a shard and I had no shards?
4337960	4340960	And yet I have an overstock of portable holes.
4342960	4344960	Should we take this guy, Olaf?
4344960	4346960	He has this great inventory of stuff.
4346960	4348960	Should we take him along with us down the road in case we need something?
4348960	4352960	Or is there something, Spencer, that we need to get off of Olaf here?
4352960	4353960	Well, I mean, I can't tell you.
4353960	4357960	I'm just like a disembodied voice that describes things around you.
4358960	4369960	However, I will say that you hear an off-kilter sound.
4369960	4371960	It seems like it's coming from the West.
4371960	4374960	It sounds like vicious clacking or maybe slithering.
4374960	4375960	You don't even know what.
4375960	4376960	I summon a squirrel.
4377960	4379960	You summon a squirrel.
4379960	4380960	Squirrel.
4380960	4383960	Run off and investigate that sound.
4383960	4385960	Ryan, I get to summon small animals once a day.
4385960	4388960	There's only one way to summon a squirrel, and you know the song, Jeff.
4392960	4393960	The squirrel song.
4394960	4396960	Squirrel, squirrel, squirrel.
4398960	4401960	Climbing trees, spreading disease.
4401960	4403960	Squirrel, squirrel, squirrels.
4404960	4407960	Hiding nuts and fuzzy butts.
4410960	4412960	Ryan and I have been on the road a long time.
4413960	4414960	You're going to get that off.
4414960	4417960	Wait, Olaf, Olaf, do I smell gravy over there?
4418960	4420960	Olaf, do I smell gravy?
4420960	4421960	Of course you do.
4421960	4423960	That's from the gravy pillow.
4424960	4425960	It's an invention of mine.
4425960	4426960	Isn't there a song about that?
4426960	4427960	It's soft.
4427960	4428960	I don't believe so.
4434960	4435960	Gravy.
4437960	4438960	No, I forget it.
4439960	4442960	Well, we heard this sound from the West, so let's wait.
4442960	4445960	I sent the squirrel off to go investigate the sound.
4445960	4446960	You send the squirrel off.
4446960	4449960	You wait for what seems like enough time.
4450960	4453960	But the squirrel does not return.
4453960	4454960	The squirrel does not return?
4454960	4455960	It does not return.
4455960	4456960	Where's my dad?
4456960	4457960	Is he still visible?
4457960	4459960	Yeah, he said, hey, guys.
4459960	4461960	I'm going to go talk to my dad.
4461960	4465960	Hey, son, does that guy have good deals?
4465960	4466960	Dad.
4467960	4470960	Eat shards much?
4470960	4471960	Yeah.
4471960	4472960	Yeah.
4472960	4473960	I don't understand.
4473960	4474960	Talk to me about that.
4474960	4475960	Listen.
4475960	4476960	Alarming.
4476960	4480960	You need to internalize the power before you can have mastery over it.
4480960	4482960	That's just, you know, gravity.
4484960	4485960	Treppy.
4485960	4487960	Barbarians aren't well-knowledge.
4487960	4489960	Should we each eat a shard?
4490960	4491960	Sounds like it.
4491960	4495960	Eat half a one now, and if we're feeling it later...
4496960	4499960	I think you're supposed to wait like 45 minutes.
4499960	4500960	Yeah.
4500960	4501960	Have some orange juice.
4501960	4503960	Yeah, does Olaf have orange juice?
4505960	4509960	I wasn't a blackout drunk when we played, and it was a month ago,
4509960	4513960	but did I think that eating a shard was a good idea?
4513960	4515960	No, I don't think you did.
4515960	4516960	Okay.
4516960	4517960	All right.
4517960	4519960	Yeah, because my dad just doesn't understand magic.
4519960	4521960	No, he's, yeah.
4521960	4523960	Look, barbarians don't know stuff.
4523960	4525960	Like father-like son, I would say maybe you eat it.
4525960	4527960	Are you saying that it's a bad idea?
4527960	4529960	It's something a dumb person does with a shard.
4529960	4532960	It's a bush leak.
4534960	4537960	I got to say, I feel like I really wasted that squirrel.
4537960	4538960	You did.
4539960	4541960	The squirrel will come back, Jeff.
4542960	4543960	Well, okay.
4543960	4545960	I'm going to summon my...
4545960	4546960	I don't know if it's summoning him.
4546960	4547960	He's on my arm.
4547960	4551960	Avenger, my hawk, who I forgot for several months.
4552960	4556960	Avenger gives out a weak cry as if it hasn't been fed in several months.
4558960	4560960	Avenger, go get the squirrel.
4561960	4565960	Avenger flies off your arm and circles the sky far away.
4566960	4567960	It returns.
4567960	4570960	Avenger, what see you?
4570960	4572960	It gives you a look that says,
4572960	4575960	I didn't see a squirrel, but there's something coming.
4575960	4577960	Go on.
4578960	4584960	I'd be able to describe it better if I weren't just a level three familiar.
4584960	4586960	I'm not smart.
4588960	4589960	Don't sell yourself shortly.
4589960	4591960	Let me tell you something.
4592960	4595960	It seemed to shift and change position as it approached,
4595960	4597960	as if I couldn't quite make out where it was.
4597960	4599960	Well, see, that's important information.
4599960	4601960	You're a good hawk.
4601960	4603960	Sharpie, I got a feeling...
4603960	4605960	You already bought the portable hole, right?
4606960	4609960	No, because he's only selling it for a shard.
4609960	4611960	You won't give up one shard for the hole.
4611960	4615960	He said it was 40 bucks, and then he said it was a shard.
4615960	4617960	I'm not giving up a shard for a hole.
4617960	4620960	I'll give you three gold pieces for a portable hole.
4620960	4622960	All right.
4622960	4625960	All right, so I got smoke sticks in a portable hole now in my inventory, correct?
4625960	4627960	Let's buy two of them and put one in the other.
4627960	4629960	I'm not selling two.
4630960	4632960	It would be all Dan Harmon about it.
4636960	4639960	The portable hole, about six quirky characters.
4639960	4640960	Olaf?
4641960	4645960	Olaf, is there anything else in your wares that we might be interested in?
4645960	4647960	Oh, I have so much stuff.
4647960	4651960	I have quells, feathers, bag of tricks, elf boots.
4653960	4655960	Did I mention the portable hole?
4655960	4657960	What's a portable hole?
4661960	4663960	I have everything you could possibly want.
4663960	4665960	Bull strength, I mentioned that.
4665960	4667960	Dad, what's coming from the West?
4667960	4668960	I can cure moderate wounds.
4668960	4670960	Not severe wounds, but moderate wounds.
4670960	4671960	I've already got that.
4671960	4672960	You have?
4672960	4673960	Yeah.
4673960	4675960	Sorry, I'm not up on the game.
4676960	4679960	I asked my dad what's happening to the West.
4679960	4683960	He motions a figure towards you and then puts his ear to the ground.
4686960	4687960	Then what?
4687960	4692960	Soon he raises his head from the ground and growls something you haven't heard in quite a while.
4694960	4696960	Displacer beasts.
4697960	4700960	Displacer beasts!
4700960	4702960	Displacer beasts?
4702960	4704960	Oh yes, displacer beasts.
4704960	4706960	Those fearsome creatures.
4706960	4711960	You see, you can't determine where they truly are, only where you think they may be.
4711960	4717960	For their shifting appearance can move them around almost randomly, as if by some powerful illusion.
4718960	4720960	Hmm.
4723960	4725960	Let's get the fuck out of here.
4726960	4727960	Yeah, let's...
4727960	4730960	Olaf, how would you like to head east in your wagon?
4734960	4735960	We head east.
4735960	4736960	Bye, dad!
4736960	4737960	Displacer beasts!
4737960	4739960	Out of our league!
4739960	4745960	He says, I always knew you were a quitter, but don't be, you know, down on yourself,
4745960	4748960	because you'll always be that way.
4748960	4749960	Bye.
4754960	4756960	He fucks off to the West.
4759960	4760960	He fucks off to the West?
4760960	4761960	He does.
4764960	4767960	We officially have the title of this podcast.
4768960	4769960	Was that your dad that just left?
4769960	4770960	Yeah, that's his dad.
4770960	4771960	That's very sad.
4772960	4774960	I have a weird relationship.
4776960	4779960	Your dad just fucked off to the West.
4779960	4781960	But that's in the direction of the Displacer Beast.
4781960	4783960	Yeah, he's going to fight him.
4783960	4784960	Yeah, we should go with him.
4784960	4785960	It's your dad, Sharpie.
4785960	4788960	Olaf, can you turn the wagon around?
4790960	4792960	Can you turn the wagon around?
4792960	4794960	He used to hit me with a belt.
4796960	4799960	Let me check to see if I have one of those.
4800960	4804960	I have no belt to hit you with.
4804960	4805960	I don't want to get hit anymore.
4805960	4806960	I want his approval.
4806960	4808960	That's what happens when you hit a kid.
4808960	4812960	He thinks it's his fault, and he's forever unfillable, you know?
4812960	4814960	Like a portable hole.
4819960	4821960	I would think you would understand.
4822960	4823960	Holemonger.
4826960	4827960	Does that term offend you?
4827960	4830960	The holes are just a small part of my stock.
4831960	4833960	Are we headed west now?
4833960	4837960	Let's all go west and follow your father and join him in battle, you know?
4837960	4839960	You want a ride from me?
4839960	4840960	Yeah.
4840960	4841960	All right.
4841960	4842960	Hop on front.
4842960	4843960	I could use a little nap.
4843960	4844960	Why don't you drive?
4844960	4845960	All right.
4846960	4850960	Spurred on by my hatred and love of my father,
4850960	4854960	I take it out on the team of horses.
4854960	4856960	Shit rolls downhill.
4856960	4857960	Yeah!
4857960	4859960	The cycle of abuse continues.
4863960	4864960	The what does?
4864960	4866960	The cycle of abuse.
4867960	4869960	Did he roll the die before he saw that?
4869960	4871960	17.
4874960	4876960	That's a strong abuse right there.
4877960	4879960	I grabbed the reins and...
4879960	4880960	Is it a goat?
4880960	4882960	What's this card being led by?
4882960	4883960	There's one goat and one horse.
4883960	4884960	One goat and one horse?
4885960	4888960	I whipped them on and we catch up to Sharpie.
4888960	4889960	Or to Mango, rather.
4889960	4891960	You catch up to Mango.
4891960	4894960	You seem to be confused.
4894960	4896960	No, Adam, that's stupid.
4897960	4898960	You arrive on the scene.
4898960	4901960	You see Mango lying on the floor in a pool of blood.
4901960	4904960	He's surrounded by four displacer beasts.
4904960	4905960	Dad!
4905960	4907960	He's unresponsive.
4908960	4911960	Ray of Frost!
4914960	4921960	It's not even my most powerful spell, it's just my trademark, you know?
4921960	4924960	You hit the displacer beast.
4924960	4926960	He takes, uh...
4926960	4927960	I'm sorry, you guys.
4927960	4929960	He takes two damage.
4929960	4930960	God damn it, I suck.
4930960	4932960	Olaf, how much are the bull strength?
4932960	4934960	I'm still sleeping.
4938960	4940960	I wake Olaf.
4940960	4942960	You wake Olaf.
4943960	4945960	Olaf, how much of a strength of bull?
4945960	4946960	Again, one shard.
4946960	4947960	One shard?
4947960	4948960	You are the shards.
4948960	4951960	I want a shard, I haven't got a shard.
4951960	4954960	Can I spare a shard, Spencer, or is that a bad idea?
4954960	4956960	I'm not gonna give you advice there.
4956960	4957960	You can do what you want, man.
4957960	4962960	Okay, I go into a berserker rage in a...
4962960	4963960	No, what's the point, with a flaming sword?
4963960	4964960	Yeah, you have a flaming sword.
4964960	4967960	Okay, I do a flaming sword attack on the displacer beasts.
4967960	4968960	Do you do a rage first?
4968960	4970960	I go into rage in a rage...
4970960	4973960	Flying into a rage and unsheathing your sword.
4977960	4980960	You fling yourself at the wild displacer beast.
4981960	4984960	You seem to strike a hit.
4985960	4988960	But the displacer beast, at the last second, is thin air.
4988960	4991960	He's five foot to the left of where you thought he was.
4991960	4993960	Where's the squirrel?
4995960	4997960	Olaf, my father needs healing.
4997960	4999960	He's a formidable fighter.
4999960	5002960	If he's healed, he'll be able to help us. Good.
5003960	5005960	I have a healing pendant.
5005960	5007960	Right here.
5008960	5009960	How much is it?
5009960	5011960	It's a shard.
5013960	5016960	You know how much it is, don't ask me anymore.
5017960	5019960	My entire wagon is yours for a shard.
5019960	5021960	Olaf, don't you see, if you don't help us right now,
5021960	5023960	this displacer beast could kill all of us.
5023960	5025960	We need to work together as a team right now.
5025960	5027960	I don't think the beast is after me, is it?
5027960	5028960	It might very well be.
5028960	5030960	Let's talk.
5039960	5041960	Let me know when I can cast a spell.
5041960	5042960	Okay.
5042960	5047960	The displacer beasts whip their dangerous shoulder-mounted tentacles towards you.
5047960	5050960	They have tentacles, they're coming out of their shoulders.
5050960	5053960	If you were on my Tumblr, you guys would know this planet.
5053960	5060960	It looks like slammer, but it's got tentacles, right?
5060960	5061960	Yeah.
5061960	5063960	It looks like slammer with tentacles.
5063960	5064960	Oh wait, that's a roper.
5064960	5066960	Displacer beasts look like feline, right?
5066960	5068960	Panthers with tentacles out of their shorts.
5068960	5072960	I remember those from 8th grade and 12th grade.
5074960	5076960	What was that, prom?
5076960	5078960	The displacer beasts pounce.
5078960	5080960	Three of them don't hit you somehow.
5080960	5083960	The fourth rakes you with a tentacle, Quark.
5083960	5084960	Me?
5084960	5085960	Yeah, you.
5085960	5086960	Okay.
5086960	5087960	You attacked that one.
5087960	5088960	All right.
5088960	5090960	It does eight damage to you.
5090960	5091960	Uh-oh, is that bad?
5091960	5092960	That's not great.
5092960	5095960	Wait, don't I have a heal of moderate wounds?
5095960	5096960	I don't think so.
5096960	5098960	No, because you didn't deal for it.
5098960	5099960	I have one.
5099960	5100960	No, I thought I did, no?
5100960	5102960	No, you didn't give me a shot.
5102960	5104960	Ryan, shut the fuck up.
5105960	5107960	It'd be in your inventory.
5107960	5108960	Yeah, I'm looking for it.
5108960	5109960	I thought I had one.
5109960	5110960	You do, man.
5110960	5111960	Okay.
5111960	5112960	I mean, if you do, it's fine.
5112960	5113960	But Olaf has...
5113960	5114960	That's true.
5114960	5117960	I'm not giving you one after the way you just spoke to me.
5119960	5121960	You want to smoke a smoke stick?
5124960	5125960	I'll give you a sharp...
5125960	5127960	I'll give you a healing...
5127960	5128960	What was it?
5128960	5129960	A healing pendant for free.
5129960	5130960	For free?
5130960	5131960	Yes, for free.
5131960	5132960	That's very nice of you.
5132960	5133960	I take the healing pendant.
5133960	5134960	You take the healing pendant.
5134960	5135960	And I put it on.
5135960	5136960	You put it on.
5136960	5138960	It feels like it'll heal you.
5140960	5141960	Does it work?
5141960	5143960	You wait for it.
5143960	5144960	It's booting up.
5144960	5145960	Okay.
5145960	5146960	No, okay, hold up.
5146960	5147960	Takes a while.
5147960	5148960	Yeah, it does.
5149960	5151960	You need to put on these health boots as well.
5153960	5154960	You gain back eight health.
5154960	5155960	You're full health.
5155960	5156960	I'm a full health.
5156960	5157960	Health boots.
5162960	5163960	Now you can cast a spell.
5163960	5164960	It's your turn.
5164960	5166960	Summon monster two.
5166960	5168960	All right, give me one second.
5170960	5171960	Summon monster two.
5171960	5174960	You can pick a monster from which to summon.
5174960	5175960	Let's see.
5175960	5176960	Celestial giant bee.
5176960	5178960	Celestial giant bombardier beetle.
5178960	5179960	Celestial riding dog.
5179960	5180960	Celestial eagle.
5180960	5181960	Or eagle.
5181960	5182960	Lemure.
5182960	5183960	That's a devil.
5183960	5184960	Fiendish squid.
5184960	5185960	Fiendish wolf.
5185960	5187960	Fiendish monstrous centipede.
5187960	5189960	Fiendish monstrous spider.
5189960	5191960	Fiendish monstrous scorpion.
5191960	5192960	Fiendish shark.
5192960	5193960	Fiendish snake.
5194960	5195960	I say centipede.
5196960	5197960	Fiendish squid.
5199960	5200960	Fiendish squid.
5206960	5207960	Fiendish squid.
5208960	5209960	Fiendish squid.
5209960	5210960	Fiendish squid.
5210960	5211960	Fiendish squid.
5211960	5212960	Fiendish squid.
5212960	5213960	Fiendish squid.
5213960	5214960	Fiendish squid.
5214960	5215960	Fiendish squid.
5215960	5216960	Fiendish squid.
5216960	5217960	I'm gonna go with the bee.
5217960	5220960	Hey, fuck you guys, just wanted to watch a squid die.
5220960	5221960	That's all you wanted to do.
5221960	5222960	This is my life.
5222960	5223960	What do you mean, cool?
5223960	5224960	Yeah, you can eat it.
5224960	5227960	It awaits your command.
5227960	5228960	Harold.
5231960	5234960	Make honey of those displacer beasts.
5234960	5235960	It's bee talk.
5235960	5237960	I mean, attack them.
5237960	5238960	Oh, okay.
5239960	5240960	That's what it says.
5240960	5243960	It goes and attacks one of the displacer beasts.
5243960	5246960	It stings it wickedly with its sting.
5246960	5247960	It hits.
5247960	5249960	But does it really?
5249960	5253960	The displacer beast is struck by the sting.
5253960	5254960	It deals six damage.
5256960	5258960	It's in the way that you use it.
5258960	5261960	Spencer, can I attack flaming sword on one of the others?
5261960	5262960	Yeah, you can attack.
5262960	5263960	Okay, flaming sword attack.
5263960	5264960	On the different one?
5264960	5265960	Yeah.
5265960	5266960	All right.
5267960	5268960	Okay, you hit.
5269960	5270960	It does two damage.
5270960	5271960	God damn it.
5271960	5273960	Oh, I didn't do fire damage.
5273960	5275960	It does six damage.
5277960	5279960	Why don't you know?
5279960	5280960	Olaf has a gun.
5280960	5282960	What the fuck is going on here?
5283960	5284960	Olaf.
5286960	5287960	Wait, wait, wait.
5287960	5288960	Olaf.
5288960	5289960	What?
5289960	5290960	Are you holding a gun?
5290960	5291960	I don't know.
5291960	5292960	Am I?
5292960	5293960	I guess.
5293960	5294960	Throw a dice.
5294960	5295960	What?
5295960	5296960	You have a gun.
5296960	5297960	I have a gun, yeah.
5297960	5299960	Why are you sitting there like an asshole?
5300960	5303960	I don't know if you're keeping score, but we got our asses kicked back there, man.
5303960	5305960	I didn't see guns seem too normal.
5305960	5306960	I guess I have a gun.
5306960	5307960	Yeah.
5307960	5308960	Use a gun.
5308960	5309960	Can I use a gun?
5309960	5310960	You do.
5310960	5312960	You have a shoot gun from an alternate plane.
5312960	5313960	A shoot gun.
5313960	5314960	A shoot gun.
5314960	5315960	All guns are shoot guns.
5315960	5316960	Yes, of course they are.
5316960	5318960	It's going to be childish about it.
5319960	5320960	It's like a poop toilet.
5320960	5322960	It is like a poop toilet.
5322960	5324960	You'll find one of those later.
5327960	5329960	Should we let Olaf use the gun or should we take it from him?
5329960	5331960	You can try either.
5331960	5332960	Olaf?
5333960	5334960	Yes.
5334960	5336960	I like your style.
5336960	5338960	I'm fond of you as well.
5339960	5342960	Take that gun out and try your luck with this place of beasts.
5342960	5344960	The slimy squid-like thing?
5344960	5346960	The panther tentacles.
5346960	5347960	Whatever.
5347960	5349960	Where's the best place to shoot it?
5349960	5351960	Right between the tentacles.
5351960	5352960	Between the tentacles.
5352960	5354960	So the head?
5359960	5360960	Bang!
5361960	5363960	Right between the tentacles.
5364960	5365960	Oh, wait.
5366960	5367960	It hits!
5369960	5371960	It's just a parachute comes out.
5371960	5373960	It deals 13 damage.
5377960	5379960	I killed that motherfucker.
5379960	5381960	One of the beasts is slain.
5386960	5388960	Dee and dam!
5389960	5391960	Dungeon snap!
5393960	5394960	That's a throwback.
5395960	5396960	How many more beasts are alive?
5396960	5397960	Two.
5397960	5398960	One's already hurt, right?
5398960	5399960	Yeah.
5399960	5400960	All right.
5400960	5402960	I'm out of bullets for my shoot gun.
5402960	5403960	Is that true?
5403960	5405960	It'll take him one turn to reload.
5405960	5407960	Yeah, because it's not called shoot's gun.
5409960	5411960	What does my mysterious emerald dagger do?
5411960	5413960	You don't even know, man. It's so mysterious.
5417960	5418960	I can't wait to find out.
5418960	5420960	Sharpie, you're up.
5421960	5423960	Scroll of...
5423960	5424960	Oh, no, wait.
5427960	5428960	I have a bomb.
5428960	5429960	You have a bomb.
5432960	5433960	I am so sorry, guys.
5433960	5434960	I forgot I have a bomb.
5435960	5436960	A bomb?
5436960	5437960	Yes, right here.
5437960	5438960	A bomb.
5438960	5439960	A bomb.
5439960	5440960	I think you had a bomb.
5440960	5441960	No.
5441960	5442960	I have a bomb.
5443960	5444960	What kind of bomb is it?
5444960	5446960	It's a plus six.
5446960	5447960	A plus six.
5448960	5449960	I guess.
5449960	5451960	Doesn't your character wear a turban?
5451960	5452960	Isn't this getting a little...
5452960	5454960	Oh, I didn't even realize.
5454960	5455960	I'm sorry, you guys.
5456960	5457960	That's Freudian.
5457960	5458960	George Lucas?
5458960	5459960	I can...
5460960	5462960	I can throw it 40 feet, apparently.
5462960	5463960	He has red hair, though.
5463960	5464960	How far away are the...
5464960	5465960	I don't have red hair.
5465960	5466960	I have a red mustache.
5467960	5468960	Get your shit straight.
5469960	5471960	How far away are the displacement beasts?
5471960	5472960	They're about...
5472960	5473960	No, they're right up to you.
5473960	5474960	They're hitting you.
5474960	5475960	That's within 40 feet.
5475960	5476960	Yeah, definitely.
5476960	5477960	I can use my bomb.
5477960	5479960	Yeah, but the bomb will go right over them.
5480960	5481960	Oh, and you know what?
5481960	5482960	I didn't see this.
5482960	5484960	It sometimes blasts multiple enemies.
5485960	5486960	Throw the bomb!
5489960	5490960	I could throw it for a shard.
5492960	5494960	If I give you a shard, will you throw the bomb?
5494960	5495960	Yes.
5495960	5496960	I give Olaf a shard.
5496960	5497960	You give Olaf the shard.
5499960	5501960	Why is everyone against that?
5505960	5507960	I just want one fucking shard.
5507960	5510960	I'll give you a shard if you promise to throw the bomb and kill these beasts.
5510960	5511960	I will.
5511960	5512960	Is there more than one beast?
5512960	5513960	There's two beasts left.
5513960	5514960	And will a bomb take care of them?
5515960	5516960	They'll hurt.
5516960	5517960	It'll hurt.
5518960	5519960	It'll hurt?
5519960	5520960	Yeah.
5520960	5521960	I don't want to waste my bomb.
5521960	5523960	You have multiple bombs, I should say.
5523960	5524960	Oh, I don't think so.
5524960	5525960	Not according to this.
5525960	5526960	I left the S out.
5526960	5527960	Oh, you did?
5527960	5528960	Bombs.
5528960	5530960	Oh, are you sure it's just not one enemy then?
5530960	5531960	No.
5532960	5534960	Maybe you misplaced your S.
5537960	5538960	Burning hands!
5538960	5540960	You cast burning hands.
5540960	5542960	What level are you guys at?
5545960	5547960	It does six damage.
5547960	5548960	Fire damage.
5549960	5552960	So how close are these guys to being dead?
5552960	5553960	You don't know.
5553960	5555960	They look burnt.
5557960	5559960	Don't give them your shard, man.
5559960	5560960	I'm not going to give them your shard.
5560960	5562960	They're not giants either.
5562960	5563960	They're not goblins.
5564960	5566960	I've already gone into a rage, haven't I?
5566960	5567960	Yeah.
5567960	5568960	What about power attack?
5568960	5569960	You could power attack.
5569960	5571960	That makes your attack less accurate and more dangerous.
5571960	5572960	You know what?
5572960	5575960	I'm going to take out the mysterious emerald dagger and see what that thing does.
5575960	5577960	You unsheathe the mysterious emerald dagger.
5577960	5579960	Would you like to wear my chain shirt?
5579960	5581960	I just noticed I have a chain shirt.
5581960	5582960	Would you like that?
5582960	5584960	It would go nice with the elf boots, too.
5584960	5588960	I put on the chain shirt and the elf boots and take out my emerald dagger.
5588960	5590960	You do those things.
5592960	5593960	As it was written.
5593960	5594960	So it shall be.
5594960	5597960	In the middle of a fight, it's like a Katy Perry concert.
5598960	5599960	Oh, yeah.
5599960	5600960	Speaking of which.
5602960	5605960	Oh, you get struck with a tentacle, Sharpie.
5607960	5609960	You take 11 damage.
5614960	5616960	Yeah, he's writing it down with a big smile on his face.
5616960	5617960	Yeah, that hurt.
5617960	5618960	That hurt.
5618960	5620960	He has healed moderate wound still.
5620960	5621960	That's true.
5622960	5624960	Scorching ray.
5624960	5625960	Scorching ray.
5627960	5628960	First time I've used it.
5628960	5629960	Okay.
5629960	5631960	Waving your hands in a magical manner.
5632960	5635960	You loose several bolts of scorching rays.
5637960	5638960	You.
5638960	5639960	Shit, you guys.
5639960	5640960	I'm terrible.
5640960	5645960	You strike the displacer beast right in the face with a scorching ray.
5645960	5646960	It deals.
5648960	5649960	I can't count.
5650960	5652960	12 fire damage.
5654960	5655960	He's on the ropes.
5656960	5658960	Mysterious emerald dagger.
5659960	5664960	Plunging the mysterious emerald dagger into the hearts of the displacer beasts.
5664960	5666960	It glows with a green, bright light.
5666960	5669960	You see it shatter into pieces and next to it.
5669960	5671960	The real displacer beasts emerges.
5671960	5674960	Oh, it can no longer use its ability.
5676960	5677960	Can't count.
5678960	5679960	Can't count.
5679960	5680960	What?
5681960	5682960	Yeah.
5682960	5684960	Does Olaf have any more bullets than a shoot gun?
5685960	5686960	He does.
5686960	5687960	I do?
5687960	5688960	Yeah.
5689960	5690960	Shoot, Olaf, shoot.
5690960	5692960	I've been waiting to see where...
5692960	5694960	You mean my plus nine attack bonus?
5694960	5695960	Is that what that means?
5695960	5697960	Yeah, that's your attack roll.
5697960	5698960	So I have eight more shots?
5698960	5699960	No, okay.
5699960	5700960	You just have infinite ammo.
5700960	5701960	What?
5701960	5702960	You have ammo.
5702960	5704960	Yeah, but it says I can sometimes blast multiple enemies.
5704960	5705960	Yeah, that's the bomb.
5705960	5707960	Damn, that's my shoot gun.
5707960	5708960	That's the shoot gun, my mistake.
5708960	5709960	Okay, yeah.
5709960	5710960	Do you want to shoot it against multiple enemies?
5710960	5711960	I'm so confused.
5711960	5712960	Sometimes?
5712960	5714960	I just want to get the fuck out of my wagon.
5716960	5717960	This is not my problem.
5717960	5718960	These guys came up to me.
5722960	5723960	I got my shard.
5723960	5724960	That's all I wanted.
5726960	5728960	I don't know what the fuck I want to do.
5728960	5729960	I'm so confused.
5729960	5731960	There's so many numbers, and you can't count.
5731960	5732960	To 12.
5735960	5737960	Use your shoot gun against multiple enemies.
5737960	5738960	Okay.
5738960	5739960	I'm using my shoot gun.
5739960	5740960	Shoot gun!
5740960	5741960	Shoot gun!
5741960	5742960	Oh, shoot gun!
5742960	5743960	Shoot gun!
5746960	5751960	The shotgun blast fires through one of the displacer beasts,
5751960	5753960	but it was really somewhere else.
5753960	5756960	It strikes into the deactivated displacer beast,
5756960	5759960	dealing seven damage.
5759960	5761960	The displacer beast falls, slain.
5763960	5764960	Are we done?
5764960	5765960	There's one left.
5765960	5766960	One more, one more.
5766960	5767960	God damn these things.
5767960	5768960	Sorry, you guys.
5768960	5769960	It's like whack-a-mole.
5771960	5773960	When did my shoot gun turn into a shotgun?
5774960	5775960	It shotgun shoots.
5775960	5777960	Can we throw our little portable hole
5777960	5779960	and then trap it in the hole?
5779960	5780960	You could try that.
5780960	5781960	Who's got the portable hole?
5781960	5783960	But it's only four feet deep, isn't it?
5783960	5784960	No, it's like ten...
5786960	5787960	I said you were four feet tall.
5787960	5788960	It's ten feet.
5788960	5789960	How tall are the beasts?
5789960	5791960	They're probably about three foot at the shoulder.
5791960	5792960	That comes in handy, doesn't it?
5792960	5794960	So I'm taller than this beast?
5794960	5795960	By about a foot.
5795960	5796960	You're not as long as it, though.
5796960	5797960	It's a three-foot beast.
5797960	5798960	It's three feet tall.
5798960	5799960	It's like a panther.
5799960	5800960	It's like a big panther.
5800960	5801960	It's like a lion.
5801960	5802960	Take your head off, man.
5802960	5803960	It's a panther.
5809960	5811960	Would speak with animals work with a...
5811960	5812960	with a displacer beast?
5812960	5813960	You could try.
5813960	5815960	I speak to the displacer beast.
5816960	5817960	What do you speak to it?
5817960	5818960	What do you think it's gonna say?
5820960	5821960	Watch this.
5825960	5826960	You're kind of being a dick.
5829960	5831960	You killed my parents just now.
5833960	5837960	It flails at you with a tentacle, but misses.
5839960	5840960	Wow.
5841960	5842960	That could have gotten worse.
5845960	5846960	Summon swarm.
5847960	5848960	You summon a swarm.
5848960	5851960	It can be of bees or bats.
5854960	5856960	Bees. I love bees.
5857960	5859960	You summon a swarm of bees.
5860960	5861960	A swarm of bees now exists.
5863960	5864960	Swarm!
5864960	5865960	All right.
5865960	5867960	You swarm the final displacer beast.
5867960	5870960	It seems to be annoyed and stung,
5870960	5872960	but it doesn't seem to be taking very much damage.
5872960	5873960	Shit.
5873960	5874960	It is rather distracted and bothered.
5874960	5877960	It seems to no longer regard you over the pain of its stings.
5878960	5880960	I loosen the mayo lid.
5881960	5883960	Somebody pop it open.
5888960	5889960	I throw knives.
5890960	5891960	You throw knives.
5891960	5892960	How many?
5892960	5893960	Just one.
5893960	5894960	You throw just one knife.
5894960	5895960	Right.
5896960	5898960	You strike the displacer beast.
5900960	5901960	It teleports away.
5903960	5904960	You don't.
5906960	5908960	You can still speak with animals, though.
5909960	5911960	Look, I'm sorry about your being a dick thing.
5911960	5913960	Sorry about your parents.
5914960	5915960	Why don't we...
5917960	5919960	Why don't we smoke some of these...
5920960	5922960	Smoke, smoke sticks.
5922960	5924960	And I throw some smoke sticks around it.
5924960	5926960	It regards the smoke sticks.
5927960	5930960	They emit a plume of smoke around the displacer beast.
5930960	5932960	You can no longer see it.
5940960	5941960	Way to go, Jeff.
5942960	5952960	It's like going up to Osama bin Laden and just putting body armor on him.
5953960	5956960	Can we get the fellowship of the nerds back up here to help us out?
5956960	5957960	Oh, I have invisibility.
5957960	5958960	Invisibility?
5958960	5959960	Yes.
5959960	5960960	Okay.
5960960	5961960	How does that help?
5962960	5963960	You could not get attacked.
5964960	5965960	See ya.
5967960	5968960	Good luck.
5969960	5971960	Can I put that on my wagon and my goat and my horse as well?
5971960	5972960	No, it's a potion.
5972960	5973960	You just drink it and turn it into this.
5973960	5975960	Spencer, what is weapon-focused sword?
5975960	5978960	It means you're slightly better than the average person with a sword.
5978960	5980960	But I've already used my sword, haven't I?
5980960	5981960	Well, you can use it more.
5981960	5982960	It doesn't get used up.
5982960	5983960	Is it my turn?
5983960	5984960	Sure, yeah.
5984960	5986960	All right, I attack with my sword.
5986960	5987960	Sword attack.
5987960	5988960	Sword attack!
5990960	5992960	You roll a critical hit.
5999960	6000960	I do.
6001960	6002960	Sorry, you guys.
6002960	6003960	I can't do math.
6003960	6004960	I'm terrible at everything.
6004960	6005960	That's the one you just threw.
6005960	6006960	Thank you.
6006960	6007960	Thanks, Ryan.
6007960	6008960	That's why you're not at the genius bar.
6008960	6009960	Fifteen damage!
6009960	6010960	Yeah, no, I'm not.
6010960	6011960	That's true.
6011960	6012960	I count boxes.
6012960	6013960	Fifteen damage!
6015960	6016960	But he's still alive.
6016960	6017960	Is he?
6017960	6018960	I don't know.
6018960	6019960	I'm building tension.
6019960	6020960	I examined it.
6020960	6021960	I examined the wounded.
6021960	6024960	He doesn't appear slain, but now he is.
6025960	6028960	You broke the tension too early, Jeff.
6028960	6032960	Just to make sure, I throw my climbing kit.
6034960	6036960	Into the air like a graduate?
6036960	6037960	Yes.
6038960	6040960	Titans and ropes spill everywhere.
6041960	6042960	Hooray!
6042960	6043960	We freeze frame.
6044960	6046960	Credit roll on this segment.
6047960	6049960	Is there any treasure to be had from these slain beasts?
6049960	6050960	No, no treasure.
6050960	6052960	They were just blocking our way somewhere?
6052960	6053960	They were going to murder you guys.
6053960	6054960	My dad!
6054960	6055960	My dad!
6055960	6056960	I have a shard.
6056960	6057960	I have a shard, no?
6057960	6058960	And you have a portable hole?
6058960	6059960	No, I was joking about the shard thing.
6059960	6060960	You didn't give me a shard.
6060960	6061960	You didn't give me the shard?
6061960	6062960	You never gave me the portable hole.
6062960	6064960	Do I have anything left in my shoot gun?
6064960	6065960	You do.
6068960	6070960	Let's have the shard, motherfucker.
6076960	6077960	Uncanny dodge.
6078960	6079960	Uncanny dodge.
6079960	6080960	I dodge as well.
6080960	6081960	That's not even in there.
6081960	6082960	Uncanny dodge?
6082960	6083960	Uncanny dodge?
6084960	6087960	The all new 2013 uncanny dodge.
6091960	6093960	It's not your father's uncanny dodge.
6094960	6096960	I cast charm person on Olaf.
6096960	6097960	Oh, it works.
6097960	6098960	Well, let me get him a little save.
6098960	6099960	Sorry.
6099960	6100960	Yeah, it works.
6101960	6104960	Let's have that stick, pal.
6104960	6107960	You now regard him as a trusted friend and ally.
6107960	6108960	You do very much to please him.
6108960	6109960	Oh.
6109960	6110960	Not that.
6113960	6118960	And heal my dad, whatever it takes, please.
6119960	6121960	Well, how about another healing pendant?
6121960	6122960	I have one left.
6122960	6124960	You're still wearing that healing pendant, Jeff.
6124960	6129960	Oh, I give the healing pendant from me to Sharpie.
6129960	6131960	He receives it.
6131960	6133960	I give it to my dad.
6133960	6136960	He cannot receive it, for he's unconscious.
6136960	6138960	I take it and get the hell out.
6139960	6140960	You're charmed.
6140960	6141960	You don't want to do that.
6141960	6144960	Oh, I can put it on my dad, right?
6144960	6145960	Yeah, no, but you can't give it.
6145960	6146960	He's dead.
6146960	6152960	Give it to him the way you give a fire hydrant wreath to a fire hydrant.
6153960	6157960	What would happen if he made a mistake and he didn't put it on his dad and he put it on the serpent?
6157960	6159960	Everything would have exploded.
6160960	6162960	That's not even a joke.
6162960	6172960	You place the necklace around your father's, you know, neck.
6172960	6173960	That's where it goes.
6173960	6179960	I start giving him CPR so that when the pendant heals him, I get the credit.
6180960	6184960	You see the blood slowly seeping back into his body.
6184960	6189960	I take a bunch of pictures and make a gif that makes it look like he's fucking his dad.
6190960	6192960	And post it on Tumblr.
6192960	6195960	It gets like 3,000 re-blogs or something.
6202960	6204960	Soon he will be healed.
6206960	6207960	Time passes.
6207960	6208960	He is healed.
6208960	6210960	I was like, thank God.
6211960	6212960	Dad.
6213960	6215960	Hey, hey, son.
6215960	6216960	Where'd you come from?
6217960	6221960	I was drawn by your horrible emotional abuse.
6221960	6223960	Come to take a run at your own man, aren't you?
6223960	6225960	Well, that's very brave.
6225960	6226960	No, no.
6228960	6229960	You dummy.
6230960	6231960	I love you.
6231960	6234960	I came to save you from those displacer beasts.
6235960	6236960	That's very touching.
6236960	6237960	I'm sorry.
6237960	6238960	I don't mean to be laughing.
6239960	6241960	Well, save me you did, son.
6241960	6242960	Save me you did.
6242960	6244960	This is twice you've saved me.
6244960	6247960	And the first was from myself.
6248960	6250960	Because he was raging, remember?
6250960	6251960	Right, right.
6251960	6252960	It's funny.
6252960	6253960	I thought you were talking about your alcoholism.
6253960	6254960	Oh, that too.
6254960	6255960	Three times.
6255960	6256960	Three times, right.
6257960	6260960	That after school special where I poured it down the drain.
6260960	6262960	Can I tell you guys something?
6262960	6263960	Please.
6263960	6264960	I don't know why I ate that shard.
6264960	6265960	It just seemed cool.
6265960	6267960	I wanted you guys to like me.
6267960	6274960	Do we have any Ipecac or?
6274960	6276960	It's a hole in the stomach.
6276960	6277960	What?
6277960	6278960	A hole in the stomach.
6278960	6279960	Ooh.
6279960	6284960	Take the horrible hole and throw it onto his stomach and get the shard out.
6284960	6286960	That's stupid, isn't it?
6286960	6287960	That is stupid.
6287960	6288960	Yeah.
6289960	6290960	That was from the audience.
6290960	6291960	That was from the audience.
6291960	6293960	A portable hole can only be placed on a flat surface.
6293960	6294960	You can't just do that shit.
6294960	6295960	Tell them what a portable hole is about.
6295960	6298960	A portable hole is a circle of fabric about three to four.
6298960	6300960	I already explained what a portable hole is.
6300960	6305960	Can't just be throwing it on people and taking shit out of them.
6305960	6307960	Dad, you got to trust me.
6307960	6312960	These shards need to be dealt with care under magical supervision.
6312960	6313960	You are a man of barbarism.
6313960	6315960	I am a man of magic.
6315960	6319960	I know you never approved of it, but maybe it was fate that I would come back into your life now
6319960	6321960	when you've encountered these things.
6322960	6324960	Just give me your shard when you poop it out.
6325960	6326960	Summon squirrels.
6328960	6330960	Olaf summons a horde of squirrels.
6333960	6334960	I just saw that.
6336960	6337960	Squirrels.
6337960	6341960	As a gnome, you're very jealous of his ability to summon multiple squirrels at once.
6342960	6343960	So now we're surrounded by squirrels?
6343960	6344960	Yeah.
6346960	6347960	Squirrel.
6348960	6352960	You'll be a woman soon.
6353960	6356960	We have to come up with a way to conclude this chapter here.
6356960	6359960	I feel like we have to get the shard out of your father's stomach, right?
6359960	6362960	Just then you hear an intense humming sound.
6362960	6365960	It sounds like it's coming from above.
6365960	6370960	It gets louder and louder and then it's pierced by a deafening, cracking crescendo.
6370960	6374960	You look up and see a huge rift opening in the morning sky.
6374960	6379960	A red scar in the otherwise blue expanse and black shapes begin flooding out of it.
6380960	6386960	These dark metallic sleek ships float on air as easily as if it were sea and sail forward without need for sails.
6386960	6389960	The humming subsides, but you can hear a distinct popping sound.
6389960	6394960	Black cylinders rain down from the ships, plummeting to earth with heavy crashes and thuds.
6394960	6396960	The fleet of ships sail swiftly away.
6396960	6398960	Mango's face grows serious.
6398960	6400960	You can hear a far-off voice saying,
6400960	6404960	Soon it will all be over.
6406960	6408960	That's Admiral Darkstar.
6408960	6409960	Admiral Darkstar.
6409960	6411960	I recognize that voice anyway, yeah.
6411960	6412960	Wait, wait.
6412960	6415960	I hit rewind so I can hear that voice again.
6415960	6416960	Say that.
6416960	6417960	Pick something else for me to say.
6417960	6418960	That wasn't very clever.
6418960	6421960	I summon better catchphrase.
6422960	6427960	Soon the Darkstar will dawn and all will be led to ruination.
6428960	6429960	All right.
6429960	6430960	All right.
6430960	6432960	That's a good, that's a good cliffhanger.
6437960	6440960	Let's hear for Spencer, everybody, our Dungeon Master.
6449960	6454960	Well, look, thank you so much for letting me be a part of that.
6455960	6457960	When do you get the man who has everything, you know?
6457960	6459960	It was really nice.
6459960	6462960	We couldn't have done it without you because you had that big...
6462960	6463960	I think you did.
6463960	6464960	Do it without me, actually.
6464960	6467960	No, we've used a lot of stuff off your cart.
6467960	6468960	You used your shoot gun.
6468960	6471960	I didn't even see half that stuff until, you know, halfway through.
6471960	6473960	I've had this, these character sheets for months.
6473960	6475960	I've never really looked at them.
6475960	6476960	I have no idea.
6476960	6479960	Or asked me anything about any part of the game ever.
6479960	6487960	So you two don't talk outside of the show.
6487960	6489960	We have a whole tour, Spencer.
6489960	6490960	Are you going on tour?
6490960	6491960	Yeah, I'm going on tour.
6491960	6492960	Oh, excellent.
6493960	6495960	Amazingly, this is a draw of the show.
6495960	6497960	Yeah, it is.
6497960	6500960	And our poster, we don't really need them.
6502960	6504960	Well, I do now for now.
6504960	6507960	I think we're making part of our merchandise.
6507960	6510960	Our tour poster is going to be a D&D map of all the places
6510960	6512960	that we're going across the country.
6512960	6513960	That's great.
6513960	6517960	And I think there's a button that says, like, it's an I love Spencer,
6517960	6521960	but instead of a heart, it's a 20-sided die.
6521960	6522960	That's awesome.
6522960	6523960	Then it doesn't make sense, does it?
6523960	6524960	No.
6524960	6526960	I die Spencer.
6528960	6530960	I roll Spencer.
6530960	6533960	That's what his uncle said to him before he died.
6533960	6536960	He's going to see it and he's going to fucking flip.
6537960	6539960	Ryan, do you have any advice for us before we embark on this journey?
6539960	6540960	Oh, it's a long trip.
6540960	6542960	You could teach Spencer to count on that trip.
6542960	6544960	That would be nice.
6545960	6546960	It's going to be fun for you, Dan.
6546960	6547960	It's going to be a lot of fun.
6547960	6548960	Really?
6548960	6549960	Did you hear what Patton was saying?
6549960	6550960	No.
6550960	6551960	Well, he was dire.
6551960	6552960	It was...
6552960	6554960	Well, he plays different places than you're going to play.
6554960	6555960	Yeah.
6555960	6556960	Maybe?
6556960	6557960	You got friends.
6557960	6558960	You're with friends.
6558960	6559960	He probably gigs alone, right?
6559960	6560960	Well, no.
6560960	6562960	He was with Maria Bamford and, I don't know,
6562960	6564960	Brian Pusane and Gallagher.
6564960	6566960	I can't remember.
6567960	6568960	I didn't see the movie.
6568960	6570960	Gallagher Franakis.
6571960	6572960	All right.
6572960	6573960	Well, let's...
6573960	6574960	Where's your first date?
6574960	6575960	Phoenix on the 10th.
6575960	6576960	That'll be great.
6576960	6577960	Good stuff.
6577960	6578960	A lot of fun.
6579960	6580960	That's a calming influence.
6580960	6582960	But we're going to be up in your neck of the woods up in Washington.
6582960	6583960	Look me up.
6585960	6586960	Where are you playing up there?
6589960	6590960	Where are we going to be?
6590960	6591960	I don't know.
