0	25000	So the San Francisco, California, and the SF Sketchfest, Hermitown, is now in session.
26000	32000	Let's bring Spencer Creighton into the stage. Spencer!
43000	48000	And the mayor of Hermitown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
55000	69000	What happened to your pants?
69000	77000	The show is already off to a San Francisco start.
77000	82000	Here's the thing, going through the TSA checkpoint, you always have to take off your belt.
82000	87000	And I thought, don't wear a belt. And then I was like, I did it, I'm a genius.
87000	92000	I got through so fast. And then I'm like, yay, I love my show.
92000	98000	Because the thing is, when you're fat and you're a guy, I'm not being sexist.
98000	101000	I'm sure if you're fat and you're a woman, I don't know.
101000	109000	I don't pretend to know about it. But when you're fat and you're a guy, you have pants in your closet.
109000	115000	And you put them on and it's like, oh, it barely fits. I can't get it around my fat body.
115000	122000	And then you're like, I don't need a belt. But then throughout the day, you fat out the pants.
125000	129000	What am I, Bridget Jones? I mean, you get the idea.
129000	134000	I didn't know until I got out here and then I was dancing and then the pants fell down.
134000	137000	It doesn't matter. This is a terrible way to start a show.
137000	142000	Hello, cultural capital of the United States of America.
144000	147000	Greatest city on earth.
150000	153000	So much better than Los Angeles.
154000	159000	Fuck that sewer, that fucking piece of fetid shit.
159000	166000	Fuck it. What kind of city is so proud of itself that it has the word Hollywood on a hill above it?
166000	168000	It's not even the name of the city.
168000	171000	Why does it say Hollywood? It's Los fucking Angeles.
171000	175000	You guys don't put San Francisco, let alone like just Ben and Jerry's or something.
175000	179000	You don't do that. You're San Francisco. You let it sell itself.
180000	185000	You're good people and you're gay and or writers.
188000	191000	This is where the typewriter was invented.
193000	196000	And you're our favorite city in the world.
196000	200000	Dan, since we are here at the historic Swedish-American Hall,
202000	206000	I know, Dan, that you are something of a closet historian.
207000	211000	Do you want to tell us a little bit about what your favorite Swedish-American...
211000	215000	What connects you most to Swedish-American history?
216000	221000	You can feel the ghosts of Swedish past out here, you know.
221000	225000	It's not just everyone's like, oh, the inventor of the meatball.
226000	231000	It's nothing. It's like, no, think about the 900,000 years of them being confused with Switzerland.
231000	239000	Just generally going like, what's our deal?
240000	242000	Like all those meetings had to happen here.
243000	245000	What's our deal?
245000	249000	What do you think separates Sweden from the rest of Scandinavia?
250000	251000	Mexico.
252000	255000	Because I dropped out of college. I don't know.
256000	258000	Was that Ron Funch's laughing?
259000	263000	He didn't stay here. That was somebody with a nailing the Ron Funch's laugh.
264000	266000	I wasn't playing with Ron Funch's.
271000	274000	That might be the ghost of Ron Funch's.
274000	276000	A famous Swedish...
277000	282000	All right. Anyways, can we please get a streamline show tonight?
282000	288000	The show started with you coming up dancing and your pants fell down like a little baby.
291000	299000	Pornography makes you feminist when you realize because men can age out better.
300000	304000	It's like eight guys still working in porn. It's not fair.
305000	309000	It's just not fair. I don't have to go. Just talk amongst yourselves about it later.
310000	315000	That's the thing. It's like, what could be less of a feminist than a guy that's watching a lot of porn?
316000	320000	But the more porn miles you log, the more you keep seeing the same eight guys.
321000	326000	You're seeing 500 women a minute and you're like, this is not a fair society.
329000	331000	All roads lead to Rome.
332000	335000	What role, Dan, do you think the man should play in a porn?
336000	337000	The father?
340000	342000	Ideally.
343000	348000	Can we please, can we, can we, can we please, can we, can we just have a moment?
349000	360000	This is San Francisco. Can we please have a moment to talk about incest porn and how ridiculous it is that there always has to be this fucking mention of my step-daddy.
361000	364000	That's not why I googled this shit.
364000	374000	Daddy, daughter in the title, and then it's like my step-daughter.
375000	379000	I'll pretend I didn't hear that because you know what I want.
380000	382000	It's the taboo.
383000	385000	This is what people don't understand about pornography, Jeff.
386000	387000	Taboo.
388000	392000	It takes you across the threshold into a world where you can become pure animal.
393000	398000	I don't want to think about my mortgage. I don't want to think about the police. I don't want to think about fucking Bill Maher.
399000	405000	I don't want to think about Jay Leno. I don't want to think about Fruit Loops. I don't want to think about cleaning the gutters.
406000	408000	I want to think about fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
409000	410000	All right.
411000	414000	That's the purpose of taboo is to like shock your system.
415000	420000	And that's our job tonight, ladies and gentlemen, here at Hammertown. We're going to take you into the realm of taboo.
421000	426000	I'm a porn zealot now because I got a divorce and I'm like totally into porn.
427000	431000	You've been hearing me in the podcast. I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn.
432000	440000	But I think the thing is like it's awakening me to like this weird disease that we have in this culture where we're like, oh, we don't understand.
441000	443000	Fuck it. No, I'm not going to.
444000	447000	Just watch porn with your girlfriend.
447000	461000	With your lover. If you're here on a date tonight, just just just just just go home to your bed and just say, let's do this as a bit because Dan Harmon said.
465000	471000	And just and just like fucking like set an hour on your iPhone.
472000	475000	And during that hour, the joke is.
478000	481000	Try to get the other person to break up with you.
485000	488000	By searching for things on Pornhub premium.
490000	496000	Like just and if you make it through that hour, fucking marry that person.
497000	506000	And if you don't keep doing this process until you marry somebody and then the divorce rate will go to zero percent within five years.
507000	513000	Is the end game all about marriage? Is that why?
514000	516000	I'm luring them in because I know what they value.
519000	522000	Marriage is a placeholder for whatever you value.
523000	526000	Can you say what the weirdest place that you go to in porn?
527000	528000	No, I can't. That's why it's amazing.
529000	534000	I mean, you already you already tipped that you are into incest porn. We already got that.
534000	537000	I am into incest porn.
539000	545000	What? What? Where? You. You. I am. Yes. You. You're fucking hot.
546000	554000	And you know what? It's it's started with fucking like it started with. Oh, daddy. Oh, daddy.
555000	561000	You know what? It's like the reason I'm willing to tell you this is because I fucking I met a girl who's like fucking into it too.
561000	566000	And I was like, like, we were just like, so. So now I'm like, oh, shit. I'm not a monster or she is too.
567000	569000	It's like it's like it's like Shrek. It's like Shrek.
571000	573000	I found my Cameron Diaz.
574000	576000	And we're just sitting in the swamp together.
577000	583000	What if the gingerbread guy fucking ate out the Pinocchio and we're like, ah, it's fucking amazing.
584000	588000	I'm telling you just tonight, just open the laptop, go to Pornhub.
588000	598000	Tell them Dan Harmon sent you. If you type in the code Harmon, it's just a free three month subscription to Pornhub premium.
599000	602000	Where were we? Oh, but my news. Where were we?
604000	614000	My new thing, I was like, brother, sister incest porn is now kind of like on my radar because I was like, oh, I'd never click on that because it's not taboo enough.
615000	621000	But it's actually kind of a turn out. Let me stop you there. Let me stop you there.
623000	629000	Brothers, fucking sisters, just doesn't scratch that itch for you yet. It's not getting there.
630000	635000	No, it doesn't. I was like, I was like, well, they're, you know, the same age and like I.
638000	642000	Yeah, tonight's gonna end with you guys either judging me.
644000	646000	Or me becoming president.
649000	659000	No, it's going to end with me being a fucking human being and getting away with murder for the rest of my life because I'm a fucking I love myself.
660000	667000	I'd rather die in a fucking ditch, an honest man going like, I thought that was hot when the sister fucked her brother.
668000	678000	I don't really want it to happen in real life ever. Why do we live in a society where movies are capable of affecting real life? That's the that's fucking fucked up.
679000	685000	In the news today is the matrix responsible for Columbine? No, you're the fucking perverts.
686000	698000	Fuck you, you know, like, I fucking pay my taxes. I get to jerk off to a video of a guy going like, hey, sister, yes, brother.
699000	704000	I know they're not really. This isn't really going to happen ever. Are they Amish?
705000	719000	But I but the hot thing about it, I could get into Amish incest porn. The hot thing about sister brother, the brother thing it should be is like that I didn't think I would actually it's the eye rolling.
719000	734000	I never thought like it's it's sex as well. I roll like it's like it's like because it's like this energy of like this sibling energy of like, hey, I'm going to tell mom and dad that you stole those that money from their cabinet.
737000	744000	Don't don't don't do that. Why would you do that? You're my step brother.
744000	759000	I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell you. I tell them you're my step sister. What do I have to do? What do I have to do? I really want to go to this concert.
759000	775000	Oh, why don't you why don't you suck my dick? Are you serious? That's the best. That's the best part is that reaction. That's the serious. It's like it's like it's like I've read when he finds out Barney wants his cocoa bubbles.
775000	793000	Are you serious? I believe that's what Joseph Campbell calls the refusal of the call. It's what Dr. Ruth would call healthy and hot because it's fucking like you want it and it's like fucking not what you're getting at the grocery store.
794000	811000	Yeah. Yeah. What do you mean? What? I'll tell you what. It's not Dorito sex, baby. It's fucking art artisanal. It's funny from your fucking soul. You know you want to fuck your brother.
812000	821000	Sorry. That's not true. I know you don't want to fuck your brother. That's not the point. No one here wants to fuck any of the relatives. She's been a real brother fucker on that line.
822000	838000	All right. So anyways, uh, okay. Segway. Well, there's another. Can you keep talking about porn for just a little bit? Can we? I don't know. I don't want people to be like, I can't. Okay. Well, we can't hear the people that are going.
839000	845000	Cheers are louder than those people are. I came here for the book reviews.
847000	863000	Moby Dick was great again. I keep sorry. I keep reading the same book. He can't get that whale. Anyways, back in the world of porn. There's this, there's this genre of porn called cuckold porn.
868000	897000	Yo, that was my accident, but let's follow that trend. Yeah. Now cuckold porn is when you watch, but, but your wife is in the crotch with a guy, but you, you, you, you're just using your eye. You're not using your dick. You don't know. You just, you're just sick of fucking your wife. So she's sick of fucking you. And so she's fucking another guy and you're watching. She's cheating on you.
898000	914000	And you're left there watching because you're a pussy and you're spineless and you're powerless and you just want to worship her sexuality. And you know what? She's so fucking sexy. You can't imagine yourself fucking her. What could be hotter than that? It's called cuckold porn.
914000	942000	However, there's, there's, there's this guy. I'd like to thank the Swedish American hall for having us here tonight. I don't, I don't, I don't know how to describe guys. I think you described it quite eloquently. No, no, no. But there's this, there's this video that I want everyone to see. And I, because it's, it's cuckold.
944000	961000	Cuckold porn. But like, so every, your typical cuckold porn video is a, uh, either a guy will walk in and go like, uh, you owe me rent. And the woman will go like, I can't pay the rent, but you must pay the rent.
961000	967000	I don't have the rent. And then the guy will go like, well, I'll pay the rent.
967000	972000	That's the, that's the first cuckold porn.
972000	983000	Yeah. All right. Okay. So let's, okay. Here's the next topic. Now I don't want to whiplash you guys, but, uh, starving, starving African children.
983000	990000	So, okay. So these videos like, don't, don't, like, don't freak out about this.
990000	1002000	Like I was watching at the airport today and there's like, uh, there was like 90 television screens because our culture is, our empire is like, it's flushed with money and, uh, it's pumping electricity.
1002000	1019000	And we have a international hub at the airport and there's all these plasma screens and on one of them, you know, there's 20 football games and there's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Anderson Cooper's talking to different people and, and, and, uh, Fox, Fox Wilderson or whoever his name is.
1020000	1029000	Greta, Greta Saskatchewan. And then they're all telling you that the middle East in the middle East today, they're crazy. We can't do nothing about it. They're crazy.
1029000	1047000	Uh, and then there's like, but football, football, football and oval teen. And then there's like, always that there's always that one screen. If there's enough, if you're in a sports bar or an airport and there's enough screens statistically on accident, there's going to be starving African children on the screen.
1048000	1069000	Uh, I don't like a loop because they're like, somebody's not paying attention and they're like, oh, that Tito's needs to be restocked. And they're like, there's, oh fuck. There's like a Christian children's network thing going on. There's just like, like African kids going, uh, and, and, and so I was like watching it and I was thinking about like, just thinking about it from a television producer standpoint for one second.
1070000	1080000	Uh, just how like you have to, in order to get that footage, you have to get on a plane and you have to fly to Africa and you have to get off the airport in Africa.
1081000	1084000	And then you, you, you have all these bags of camera equipment.
1085000	1090000	Please. Can I finish? It's, it's, it's going to get worse.
1091000	1100000	It's not really. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, and you have camera equipment and you have probably, I mean, that's for real some food. You have some food.
1101000	1112000	When's the last time any of you traveled without a couple of neutral grain bars? Um, and they're like, where are we? We're going.
1113000	1119000	And I'm sure these are the most wonderful people in the world. They're probably for all I know. It's like, I don't like, like they might be volunteering.
1120000	1127000	Like, I don't, I don't think they're like, but they're like from the first world and they're coming here and they're going to work. Okay. Our job is we got a shot list.
1128000	1141000	They have a shot list and the shot list says hungry baby, baby with flies on face, hungry mother, baby,
1142000	1150000	can't give the whatever. I don't, it's, it's just like, or it's just like, it may be not in a line item list, but so that it's a, it's a, it's a video production.
1151000	1168000	And like, like they go and they have to shoot it and you know that they have like fucking probably pockets like full of neutral grain bars and like, I don't know, like shooting and they, and obviously they're going to give everybody when they go there, they're going to give them food.
1169000	1177000	Of course they're going to give them food. Do we know that? Well, I'm going to assume that because of human nature.
1178000	1186000	But then as a producer, I'm also going to assume obviously they can't give them that food until they get their shots.
1186000	1198000	So I just said that there's like 10 minutes of that whole thing. It's like, from a, from a bird's eye perspective, it's like, it's like, well, this is normal. Yeah.
1199000	1209000	You went down there and you covered the stuff and it's like, but then you zoom in and you're like, yeah, but for that 10 minutes, like you have like a strawberry granola bar in your pocket.
1209000	1222000	And then you're like, okay, so I'm just going to, uh, boy, he's hungry. Um, okay. Can you, can you kind of, can you, somebody move that tree.
1222000	1231000	Lin, Lin, it's just, it's just left, left. And then like, okay. So, all right. He's clearly so hungry.
1232000	1241000	Like, for, like, for, like, for all like, for like Greta Garbo and certain old like, like silent movie actresses, they would put like a candle on top of the camera to give them that, that kind of glimmer in their eye.
1242000	1248000	A key light that makes them seem like they're crying. Do you think they put like a little granola bar on top of the camera?
1252000	1263000	I'm not, I didn't come here with him. He, he flew out of Burbank. I flew out of LAX. Like I'm not like with him. That's not the joke.
1264000	1270000	I don't jerk off to it. Children being raped, raped by their fathers. Yeah. Well, okay. So I'm the bad guy.
1271000	1273000	Fun, fun, just keep it down. Will you?
1274000	1291000	No, that's not, I wasn't, no, no. But, but, but I'm saying like, like, all right. Well, you get the idea that there's like somewhere out there, there's like an eight minute window where somebody's like, like, I'm gonna, well, remember that day that we gave that kid a gumdrop or whatever, and then ruined the shot.
1292000	1307000	Like we're, and then in other words, like we gave their less money came in and like, like, so you have to actually think if you're the most benevolent person in the world, if you're a volunteer and you're working for that organization, your job is to actually shoot starving people.
1308000	1321000	Right. And they cannot be fed while they're on camera. You, you fucking connect the dots that, that I had to connect today.
1322000	1325000	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1326000	1338000	Cynicism sometimes needs to be yanked up from the floor and shoved in your face because there's not enough bad things to feel bad about.
1339000	1348000	So I have to go like hunting for the, like the one. No, I was just thinking, it just, it just seems sad and ironic. Okay. All right.
1349000	1357000	The cuckold guy. I just wanted to talk about the specific cuckold porn where there was a guy, a guy comes in.
1358000	1363000	How do we say we have cuckold porn and just driving children? I forget because there was, there was a through line there.
1364000	1375000	There's a cuckold porn video where a woman is sitting on her bed in a bathrobe and then the door opens, the bedroom door opens and there's this guy comes in and he's wearing, he's on a hoverboard, one of those.
1376000	1386000	And he has a helmet on and it has blinking lights on it. And he, and he goes, is he the protagonist? Yes. Just don't, sorry, sorry.
1387000	1396000	And he comes in and he goes, hey, honey, look at me. Oh, look what I got. Meep, beep. I'm a robot. Beep, beep, beep.
1397000	1409000	And he's like twirling around in his hoverboard for real. And she, and she's like, what's going on? What's going on? Because like she's, they're all porn actors and they've all been told to say certain things at certain times, but it's already fucked up.
1410000	1424000	And then there's like weird, like this guy comes in creeping in after the hoverboard guy and he goes like, I got to tell you your husband, he took to this thing like I've never seen and it's just $700.
1425000	1433000	And she's like, he can't pay for that. And he's like, oh, well, we don't need a car anymore. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep. And he keeps twirling around.
1433000	1442000	And then they, and then the guy is like, he's like, he's like, well, I can't, I got to tell you, he bought the hoverboard. So I don't know what to tell you.
1443000	1455000	It's just like, and it just goes on and on. Like watching porn people who have never had a single UCB workshop, like, and you know, like the camera, like, you know, like the camera, the camera will just cut sometimes because it's like,
1455000	1464000	so ever since they're just in a circle, it's like, it's like the ants deaths, march death, like, because they're just like, they don't know how to stop asking questions and denying each other.
1465000	1472000	Like, what do you mean? I can't do this. Well, something's got to be done, but I can't do this. And then it'll cut to like a slightly different angle, but it's a different time of day.
1473000	1477000	And then they're like, okay, well, here, how do we work this out? Because they've been like cattle prodded.
1477000	1485000	The woman finally goes like, well, there must be some way we can work this out.
1486000	1493000	But then the guy is on the hoverboard and he, he's just like having a great time on the hoverboard.
1494000	1500000	And then the guy, this is the supposed alpha male who is not in control of the scene.
1501000	1509000	He has, because they understand cuckold craft, they understand porn craft, they don't understand stage craft and they don't understand the effect of a fucking hoverboard.
1511000	1519000	This guy is not going to be the low status character, no matter what they do. This is the China syndrome of cuckold porn.
1520000	1530000	They were fucked before they started and everyone in the scene is fucked. But the guy sits on the bed and he goes like, well, something's got to get worked out.
1531000	1537000	And the guy just keeps like backing into furniture and he's like, and she goes like, well, I'd like to work it out.
1538000	1547000	And then the guy says, are you thinking how to work this out? Same way I'm thinking how to work this out.
1552000	1558000	That's actual dialogue. That's actual dialogue. He speaks in origami.
1559000	1565000	He's on the center of his palindrome and it folds out and then you're like, oh my God, he's a genius.
1566000	1574000	They go like, slavery, not a good thing, cuz, human, not a good thing, cuz. And you're like, oh, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, my boy.
1576000	1577000	Anyways.
1578000	1579000	So what happens?
1580000	1581000	Well, I'll tell you what happens.
1581000	1582000	Is that act one?
1583000	1594000	Yeah, the crossing of the threshold is, of course, the guy's gonna start fucking the woman. But the guy keeps backing into shit in the room and they keep getting startled and he's got all the status.
1595000	1607000	And then he starts having sex. He's going like, oh, I love my hoverboard. And then the alpha guy is fucking his wife and he tries to get it back by going like, more like a nerd board.
1608000	1613000	But it's like, oh, no, you shouldn't even have tried. Like, he's fucking owning you.
1614000	1618000	Like, the guy is like, he's like, he's like, he's fucking great.
1619000	1621000	What is the act two, like, crisis?
1622000	1629000	Well, it's always like, then the woman and a good cuckold porn couldn't air quotes. I think the woman will go like, you get over here and you suck his dick.
1630000	1634000	Wait, the guy has to get off the hoverboard and suck the alpha guy's dick?
1635000	1636000	That's right, San Francisco.
1638000	1641000	Looks like someone came in a little higher than you.
1643000	1645000	You thought you were all impressed with yourselves. Yeah.
1646000	1650000	Maybe I watched a couple dudes and a fucking girl and one guy sucked that guy's dick tonight.
1652000	1662000	She goes, suck that guy's dick or lick his balls. And then the guy gets on the bed and he goes, he starts licking like other guy's balls, but he's like, he's looking off in the distance and going.
1663000	1677000	And the look on his face, it looks like he's like the kid from Pet Sematary. Like, he doesn't, like, again, he's not, like, he's not low status. Like, he controls the room.
1678000	1684000	Wait, the wife said you lick his balls. Get off the hoverboard and lick the alpha male's balls.
1685000	1697000	In cuckold porn, there's like, it's not always, there's not always the male on male thing, but like in a, it's a typical of cuckold porn where like the woman will say to the beta male, she'll go, now you do this.
1697000	1709000	And then the, and then this guy, this guy eventually like starts blowing that guy. That's the other hilarious part is that, is that then the alpha male always has this.
1710000	1717000	It's like the other guy is like going down at him and then the alpha male goes like, I don't know if I signed up for this.
1718000	1721000	Like four bobs in.
1725000	1729000	I don't know if I said, yeah, it's not a matter of paperwork at this point.
1730000	1737000	And that's a good thing. And you should accept that. Like your hard on is all the pen and paper you need.
1738000	1740000	So what is act three of this whole thing?
1741000	1743000	I just never, I just, I never finished.
1744000	1746000	Well, what would I finish?
1747000	1749000	We start now while you stop the tape or whatever.
1751000	1752000	Bob for.
1757000	1758000	Spacebar.
1764000	1769000	Once again, thank you Swedish American Hall for having us here tonight. It's a great heritage.
1770000	1776000	So anyways, this, hey, this doesn't broadcast outside of San Francisco, does it?
1777000	1778000	I hope not.
1779000	1783000	All right. Anyways, it's tight sweater again. Thank you, ladies.

1803000	1813000	Now this is where my show is going to go all stunty potentially. I hope you guys are okay with a little, a little bit of a chicanery, a little bit of prop comic.
1814000	1822000	We don't, we normally, we just come up here and we were at freestyle and we were talking about New Year's Eve and Times Square.
1823000	1829000	And you were telling me that like the people that cram into Times Square for New Year's Eve, they were diapers.
1835000	1840000	San Francisco is, uh, is, is, is blown away.
1840000	1844000	Some, some, some people, cause you know, you're, you're shoulder to shoulder with a lot of people and there's.
1852000	1858000	See, I like her style, but madam, you heard the harrumphing going on.
1860000	1867000	No, yeah. And she's saying like the harrumphing is a second level harrumphing. Okay. We've got all the tools we need. We choose to harrump.
1867000	1874000	Oh, they're harrumphing is they get the premise. They don't like where it's going. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Well, well, that's a good question.
1875000	1884000	Are you guys harrumphing because you don't believe it? The people wait. I, well, I can't tell that I can't, we're going to need to elect a representative to speak for you or something.
1885000	1895000	Who is the guy that said, I get it. What was your name? Come on stage. Get up here. If you want, if you want, if you want, we won't, we won't make fun of you.
1896000	1913000	If you want to come up, come on here. Why don't you sit there and I'll sit there and I'm going to lower this and I think I feel like what is your name? Nicky. Nicky, what happened to the knees of your pants?
1914000	1931000	I fall a lot. You fall a lot? I love it. I mean, that's crazy to, to come on, say to a youngster. Obviously that's some kind of fashion thing. That is, that is suggestive.
1932000	1938000	Were these knee blowouts on your jeans by design or by accent? Did you wear those jeans so much that the knees actually gave out?
1939000	1946000	Both. They were ripped when I bought them and they have become increasingly more blown out.
1947000	1950000	Are you 21?
1953000	1955000	Fair question. Yes, I am.
1956000	1959000	Okay. Do you want to, do you, I don't look, I don't do this a lot.

2118000	2128000	Make yourself useful, Dan. I'm only doing this because you guys are the, I'm only doing this because you guys are the cultural capital of the United States.

2144000	2157000	The plot, the plot thickens. Both of my best friends, the straight woman and the gay man. He lives with a gay man and a straight woman and both of them are my best friends.
2157000	2166000	Wait, wait, wait. No, that, that got intricate. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Say that again. He lives with a gay man and a straight woman and both of them are my best friends.
2167000	2178000	Come and knock on our door. He lives with a gay man and your best friend, but you don't live with him. No. I'm just trying to parse through this because I, I, I, I. Is that back up for me, Dan?
2179000	2187000	No, this is for Nikki, who took the first one and was like, I can't drink this without a friend. Dan, make a fireman line. Make me a drink, too, you piece of shit. God damn it.
2188000	2201000	All right. While you're at it. Okay. All right. Well, cheers. Nikki, I'll give it to you. Nikki, your cup. Take the drink. Rob, Rob, Rob. Pass it.
2201000	2216000	I don't know how to do a show. I don't know how to do a show. Okay. There you go. Okay. Okay. So what, what, what the fuck were we talking about when you came up? Ask him about chemtrails.
2223000	2230000	There's a, there's a mandate about chemtrails. Yeah. Couldn't fit all those chemicals on one of those little planes. Wait, what?
2232000	2253000	What about chemtrails? Dan, you were talking about New Year's Eve and the fact that people can't pee and she goes, we get it. We're like, we're with you, mister. Right. But I think she was saying that we're all on board with, you can't, there's no word of pee in times square. So people are like doubling down and going for it. Yeah. Right. And I sparing us from the explanation.
2253000	2282000	I'm not going to wear a diaper, but if I have to pee, I'm going to do it. Have you been to Times Square in New York before? I have not during New Year's. I have peed in Times Square. You've peed in Times Square. Just walk in front of the M&M store. He's like, fuck it. I gotta, I gotta hang a squirt. Hang a squirt. That's a new one. Oh, Dan.
2283000	2310000	All right. Let me tell you about my porn fetish. Squirt hangers.com. Don't pay for it, Jeff. Nikki, when you say that you've peed in Times Square, walk us through that, would you? Oh boy. Well, we were in Times Square and drunk. Right. Is this daytime or nighttime? This is daytime. Atta girl. And we decided.
2310000	2339000	Eat that mic, Nikki. Eat the mic? Yeah, just just up here. Yeah. That's just so they can hear you. Dan also goes to miceaters.com. So I decided that I needed to pee and around Times Square. They don't let you do that because obviously all the tourists want to. So we decided we were going to head off to like a house.
2340000	2369000	A side road and like find a place to pee. There's no side roads in Times Square. It's called 54th Street. I was drunk. I was drunk. So I walk off and try to do that and I'm squatting, doing my thing. And I look up and. You're up against a tree or you're hiding in an alleyway? I was up against a car. A car. There's a Times Square's version of trees.
2369000	2398000	So you're peeing next to a car. So I'm up against a car peeing and I hear like a tap and I look up and there's people in the car. No. Why are they in the car? What are they doing in the car? They were parking. How dare they? As one does. Come on. It's back to get peed on. I just want to get the full picture.
2399000	2421000	So there's a street that they're like doing a parallel parking thing and you're like next to the. I just want to get a complete picture. It seemed like a very suburban street. I now like. Times Square. The suburbs. Just off of Broadway. A nice bedroom neighborhood. Just outside of Hedwig.
2421000	2450000	No. If you hit caps, you went too far. I think it was a family that was like trying to visit Times Square on their vacation. And there's a lady just. I was a chick just peeing on their car. Yeah. But like on the sidewalk. I just I'm trying to picture their car like crouching by the car and then I heard a tap. Because there was like out of you. But in the view of four people wearing Wisconsin hoodies right by the driver's window. Right. All right.
2451000	2480000	So you're in the streets. If you're by the driver's window, you're out in the middle of the road. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was. That's my girl. That's your girl. You should not applaud that. I mean, you wanted to never close your eyes anymore. All right. Didn't say it was a classy moment for me, Jeff. Right. Well, I honestly, we got a lot of show to do and I think they're they're wonderful. We can humbly excuse ourselves.
2481000	2500000	That's what I got a lot to do. I if you guys want to plug something or you were you were wonderful. They should buy you a drink later. But if there's anything you want to say, burn down the White House. Is that what you want to say, Rob? I'm happy to plug bias a drink later. What's that?
2500000	2525000	Bias a drink later. Oh, bias a drink later. I didn't. Okay. I thought it was like the name of a like Robin Nikki. You can find on p Parker.com. Everybody. All right. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I wasn't if you if you go back to the history of that broadcast, like, Jeff was the one that was like, Get up here.
2526000	2543000	Because I was in the midst of a point that I was trying to make like I but I was interested in whether or not you guys believe that people wear diapers. But no, I'm not anymore. I don't know. I've moved beyond whether it's true. I think we're finding out that you don't need to wear diapers. You can just go pee in the middle of the road.
2543000	2567000	55th. Because I got to stop cloking this in science. Like it's a science thing. It's a thing that I want to do. We were at the studio. We were talking about this and I was I said to Steve Levy at my assistant who was here is it go go get some diapers, some adult diapers, like, and I and bring them here. And I want to I want to like, it's like, like, I'll put I'll put a pair on you wearing diapers right now. No, no, I haven't put them on the radio.
2567000	2580000	I thought because also it's I don't want to like plan things, but I thought like, Steve, Steve, Steve, do you have the did you have the diapers? Oh, no. Okay. Steve, Oh, here he comes. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. What in the shopping? Yeah.
2580000	2605440	What's in the bag? Take the mike, Steve, the mike. These are the ones that you said. Those are the fancy ones. So you use like designer. This is like when people are looking at the
2605440	2634480	fancy ones. So you use like designer. This is like when Paul Rudd finally has to piss his pants. He's gonna wear real fit for men. And then the other one, the other ones are depend for men. I mean, I don't say what? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think I really don't know. I think I would I would I would think maybe
2634480	2659760	they're sexier. The female, the female ones are sexier. Well, no, because they have frills and padding. But I would also maybe madam, I don't know. And I back you up every step of the way. If you want to escape a dichotomous world of adult diapers. I'm with you. Say what? Oh, you have a theory? Okay. Well, can you shout it out before we bring you up here and do all the diaper theory? Just shout out your theory and
2659760	2689760	get up here. Okay. All right. Get up here. Get up here. Come on. She says she's a tumbler. Now we have to bring her up. Diaper tumbler. Diaper tumbler. What? Please tell me you're wearing diapers right now, madam. What is your name? Lindsay. Lindsay, everybody. Welcome. And move that. Okay, Lindsay. What? What's your theory? I'm not sure I can get on this chair. Well, that's it. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not.
2689760	2719120	It's cool. You're only here to give your theory. And so no dream is too big. All right. For me, maybe I can't reach it. Lindsay. God damn it. The theory. Okay. So I have a tumbler. It's called fragile masculinity products. Oh, sorry. Say it again. Fragile masculinity products. Okay. Right. Say again. Wait. Okay. Just can't keep going through these nested loops.
2720360	2725800	And she's going to bring you up and then we're all, we're going to end up doing a show for cockroaches in China.
2729040	2736440	So my theory is that if you, if you use a product that's not branded for men and it's something to do with caring for your body, it makes you gay.
2736880	2748240	Oh, okay. Well, that's, I mean, that's fair in a world where they're like Coke zero exists. Like you one would expect. Yeah. That if Dr. Pepper 10. One of the products on the tumbler is aroma therapy for men.
2748240	2777240	And it's called beast mood. Well, yeah, we're talking. Yeah. So, so yeah, I mean, that's, that's easy enough to like, like they market test stuff and then they ask men. There's a tactical Christmas stocking. A tactical Christmas. That's cool. No, it's not. That's like, if you get a knife, there's a tactical baby carrier. That's cool. Like if you get a knife. No, I mean, they're made.
2778240	2808240	See on the package, there's a bulge there. I'm sure that's not the women's depends, right? That's what I was going to say is that am I being a naive and thinking that the women's stream comes a little bulge. It's not just pee. Well, but it doesn't even matter. Cause like, like the front there is, you don't know. Like what would be your, I mean, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not locking horns with you. When I say this, I just think this is very interesting because I, I, I feel like, like obviously capitalism, it probably, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
2808240	2838240	it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
2838240	2868240	it's, it's it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
2868240	2898240	it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it
2898240	2907280	you, yeah, but prove they're not for men, I'm going to be hearing that for the rest of my life.
2907280	2910080	Prove they're not for men.
2914080	2917760	That's, that's happening at Trump rallies all over America, I gotta-
2920000	2922800	Bad things come inside the country.
2922800	2926880	Hey, you're right, because of your hair.
2929440	2932080	I'll totally wear one if this means feminism wins.
2933040	2933760	Wait, sorry, what?
2934400	2937040	Does this mean feminism wins if I wear an adult diaper for men?
2937040	2937760	Wins what?
2937760	2938080	I-
2938080	2940480	Just wins, just wins.
2941680	2944960	Feminism only loses if you say that.
2944960	2959360	Oh no, the idea that it's a, that it's a horse in a race, not to high road you, but,
2959360	2967040	but no, I mean, I would be happy to, to, to, to, in the spirit of, of, yeah, of course. Yeah.
2967040	2971680	I mean, I don't know what it'll do for gender dichotomy. I don't know what it'll do.
2972240	2976160	I don't think this has to be about any, any actual empirical experiment.
2976160	2976960	I think it's simply-
2978080	2978720	Do you need that?
2979520	2979920	But I know.
2984160	2986240	I think we've had enough pants down on the road.
2988800	2989920	You can't wear over your pants.
2991360	2994640	No, I'm not gonna, I'm, I have to, you know, you have to put them over your job.
2994640	2996560	And I don't know if that's illegal or not, but I,
2998320	3000320	these are so much more thin than I thought.
3002160	3006800	Oh, be sure they got a diaper for your drink.
3012560	3014480	What? Well, just give me the corner.
3018160	3020800	Since 1849, the Swedish American Hall.
3032400	3034400	Just keep it, keep, just keep it near you.
3035920	3036480	Hey, guys.
3037200	3037840	Oh, nice.
3039280	3040160	Careful, careful.
3042320	3042960	Oh, geez.
3044080	3044560	Oh, boy.
3046960	3048880	Yeah, you don't have to do it. Don't feel weird.
3050240	3051120	Oh, she's doing it.
3051120	3051600	All right.
3051600	3055520	Ooh-ee.
3060800	3063920	Now, Dan, personal question, Dan.
3063920	3066240	Be careful. Don't hurt yourself.
3066240	3066800	Can I ask?
3066800	3067680	They are super tight.
3068400	3070480	Take her wallet. Get her stuff.
3071840	3074560	Oh, get it, get the pants.
3074560	3076960	Dan, have you taken the show pee? Did you pee before the show?
3078000	3079280	Have you got one of the chamber?
3079280	3082160	I did pee before the show, but we got a lot of people to talk about.
3084880	3086240	That's why it's for men.
3090000	3091200	Oh, shit.
3091200	3091680	Shit.
3093520	3094000	I became a murderer.
3094000	3095440	Touch that, Betty, for Dan.
3096880	3098800	I didn't intend for this to be a gender thing.
3098800	3099360	Don't jump too high.
3099360	3101680	Hey, also, she has a weapon.
3102480	3104720	This is an actual knife.
3105840	3106640	Don't hurt yourself.
3106640	3107120	That's cool.
3107120	3109680	And you brought it up here?
3109680	3114080	I feel like we should be protecting her and not going through her stuff.
3114080	3115200	I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
3115200	3118000	Dan, I'm going to ask you.
3118000	3120560	I've never worn an adult diaper before.
3121520	3123520	Do you feel secure?
3126000	3129520	Okay, I want, I want, I just really want to pee, so.
3129520	3134000	Mary, I'm asking you an honest question.
3134000	3135840	I mean, do you feel secure?
3136160	3139920	If you peed right now, do you feel that that would contain the pee?
3139920	3140320	I don't.
3140320	3140960	No, I don't.
3141600	3145440	Because it feels like there's a sheet of cardboard, like, wrapped around my.
3145440	3146640	It's really chafey.
3150080	3150880	All right.
3150880	3152080	Let's get back to the show.
3154080	3156800	If you want, you can put your pants back on.
3156800	3158800	I'm going to put my pants back on because I feel like part of it.
3158800	3160400	Nobody puts their pants back on.
3161440	3162720	The pants stay off.
3162720	3164240	This is, this is quite freeing.
3164320	3167440	No, I feel like, I feel like the point of the diaper is to have them.
3167440	3167680	Okay.
3167680	3168560	Put your pants back on.
3168560	3170400	Because also we have some serious questions.
3170400	3170800	Okay.
3170800	3170880	Okay.
3170880	3171440	How about this?
3171440	3172960	Dan, you be the control.
3172960	3173440	No, no.
3173440	3174400	Lindsay, you be the control.
3174400	3175520	Put your trousers back on.
3175520	3176720	Dan, you be the experiment.
3176720	3177760	Leave your trousers off.
3179440	3179920	Right?
3179920	3180160	No.
3181040	3182800	I'm trying to be MythBusters about this.
3182800	3184800	No, it's, I have.
3184800	3185840	Where is San Francisco?
3185840	3187440	This is MythBusters territory.
3189600	3190720	It's a final season.
3190720	3193840	The idea is that they're in Times Square and they're wearing these things under their pants.
3194320	3194480	Okay.
3194480	3195520	You're right.
3195520	3196160	You're right.
3196160	3199280	Okay, so the controller, we're doing a male and female experiment right now.
3200800	3201520	It doesn't crinkle.
3201520	3202800	We have a question.
3202800	3204000	Dan, does it crinkle?
3204000	3205200	We have a question from the front.
3205200	3206720	Actually, it feels really nice.
3208480	3213920	I can't tell it from, unless I touch it with my hand, I can't tell it from comfortable underwear.
3214640	3217360	That's actually, I'm glad that you're asking questions.
3218160	3220560	Actually, it's notable how comfortable they are.
3221360	3222480	It actually feels nice.
3222480	3223760	Take that, Calvin Klein.
3224400	3230480	Because my big thought is, is it true that adults can wear these and then you can,
3230480	3236000	could you wail into your pants just for one fucking pee, for instance?
3236000	3238400	Dan, Dan, the night is young, baby.
3238400	3239280	We're going to find out.
3241920	3244000	Because it doesn't feel like it would hold anything.
3244640	3245440	All right.
3245440	3246160	I can't do it yet.
3246160	3246480	I can't do it.
3246480	3247360	Take this shit.
3248480	3249280	I'm not doing that.
3249280	3250160	That's all right.
3250160	3250640	Yeah.
3251600	3254080	Shit on the floor.
3254080	3255760	Podcast shit.
3255760	3257040	Podcast shit.
3257040	3258880	Podcast shit.
3258880	3260720	Podcast shit.
3260720	3261760	I will clear.
3261760	3264080	I will clear the Swedish American Hall, you guys.
3268640	3269440	Okay, so.
3269440	3270640	We're going to win that webby.
3273280	3274320	What's your name, young lady?
3274320	3274640	Lindsay.
3274640	3275040	Lindsay.
3275040	3278560	Lindsay, would you go take a seat with your diaper.
3278560	3282400	If you start to feel like you're ready to take a piss, you can come up on stage and-
3283200	3283600	Okay.
3283600	3284000	Okay.
3284000	3284640	But just otherwise-
3284640	3287520	I feel like this gives me an extra drink during the show.
3287520	3289280	Because I mean like it'll hold one.
3290240	3291120	I mean, I need one too.
3291120	3291440	But-
3291440	3294720	Let's thank Lindsay and we'll see her in a little bit.
3294720	3295040	Yeah.
3301760	3302240	Yeah.
3307280	3307600	Okay.
3307600	3308720	This shit is about science.
3308720	3309600	We did it.
3309600	3310880	Okay, so.
3310880	3311360	So Dan-
3312240	3313680	Oh, and it's night when you sit.
3313680	3316160	It's like a Nike.
3319360	3320560	It's like a gel pad.
3321840	3322800	I just felt like a-
3326320	3328480	Now imagine taking a shit right now.
3329840	3334160	I'm not going to poop in them, but I am really curious like can an adult
3335040	3337280	pee in an adult diaper
3337280	3338000	just hang out.
3339440	3340720	I am curious about that.
3341920	3345680	Has anybody here successfully peed in an adult diaper?
3345680	3346160	Okay.
3346160	3347040	Oh, the hands go up.
3347040	3347680	Yeah.
3347680	3348240	People have.
3348880	3349120	Yeah.
3350240	3351120	But what matter-
3351760	3352320	Say it louder.
3357920	3358960	It starts to sag.
3360160	3361600	Okay, hang on.
3361600	3362400	Hang on.
3362400	3363760	Everybody, I want complete-
3364720	3365920	God bless me.
3366640	3369680	The Ben Franklin of the most obvious statement about-
3369680	3373760	I was like, we needed to hear her say that, but it's like, yeah, I guess that makes sense.
3374400	3379360	She said after you pee, it gets weird and it gets heavy and it starts to sag.
3381040	3384960	Can we get complete Swedish American Hall silence by applause?
3384960	3386480	And I don't want ironic applause.
3386480	3389840	Actual people who have peed in a diaper in public.
3392000	3394560	That's nine people.
3394720	3395280	Seven, yeah.
3396880	3397440	Okay.
3397440	3398640	Yeah, so that's for real.
3398640	3404240	So we're gonna, we're gonna, now we got that cooking and I swear if I have to pee,
3404240	3407520	I'm gonna fucking let it go and I'm gonna tell you.
3407520	3408800	I'm gonna tell you I'm doing it.
3408800	3411840	Didn't- did you bring extra pants just in case?
3411840	3412320	No.
3414080	3415440	No, because I'm not a hack.
3418080	3418720	It's real-
3418720	3420000	I'm not Chris Angel.
3420000	3421200	I'm a fucking magician.
3421200	3425440	I'm not an illusionist.
3425440	3427440	I do fucking magic, okay?
3428320	3431360	When I make the Statue of Liberty go away, it fucking goes.
3432400	3434800	Your huddled masses don't know where they are.
3438000	3441280	Did I tell you guys- did I ever say in the podcast when I was 10 years old,
3441280	3444240	David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear and I didn't know?
3445280	3447280	I turned off the TV and I was like, huh.
3447760	3449760	Yeah.
3449760	3451280	I don't know if he should have done that.
3452720	3453440	Yeah.
3453440	3457920	And it was like two days later that my name was a kid, he made it come back, you dick.
3458480	3458960	All right.
3459920	3463040	Listen, I know what you guys are thinking.
3464080	3465040	Okay, well, I want to-
3465040	3468400	No, I mean, yeah, we- I know, I know what I'm thinking.
3468400	3471680	I'm thinking how close are you to peeing your pants and proving it's his business.
3471680	3474720	Listen, I don't want to disappoint you guys, but I'll drink as much as I can.
3474720	3476560	Maybe somebody bring up like a bottle of water.
3476560	3478080	Can we get Dan nine iced teas?
3479680	3482880	If there's like a bottle of water or something, because I don't want anybody to be pissed off.
3482880	3483600	I'll piss my pants.
3483600	3484720	Dusty roads.
3484720	3486080	But, well, that happens.
3486880	3491040	I want to talk to somebody- she tweeted me, Amber, are you in the audience?
3492640	3493120	Amber?
3494480	3495360	Amber, you're not here?
3497600	3500000	Amber, do you have cold feet now? Do you want to come up and talk?
3501280	3501920	You can come up?
3501920	3503520	Okay, Amber, okay, come on up, Amber.
3506560	3514160	All right.
3522880	3523760	This is soundtrack.
3525120	3526160	Hey, Amber.
3526160	3530480	So, are you co- uh, have a seat here.
3531440	3532080	There you go.
3532480	3538480	All right, Amber, let's get ready to fucking hairpin turn.
3538480	3540400	That's what Harman Town's tonality is about.
3540960	3541920	It's not that bad.
3541920	3546800	Amber is fresh, fresh off of a double mastectomy.
3546800	3548080	Yep, on Monday.
3548080	3548880	Monday.
3548880	3550640	So, tonight is Saturday.
3551920	3554240	And you're like, and one of the things you warned me about is like,
3554240	3555840	well, I'm going to be whacked out on drugs.
3555840	3559200	Because you're like, this is not an outpatient procedure, is it?
3559200	3559600	Oh, no.
3560240	3562320	But you're like, you're recovering.
3562320	3562880	Right.
3562880	3565280	I'm still really sore and I'm still on a bunch of drugs.
3565280	3566720	And you have a, you have a knit cap on.
3568800	3570800	Yeah, it's from chemo before.
3570800	3571200	Right.
3571200	3574000	So, like, there's so many things that I don't understand about,
3575520	3576080	about this.
3576080	3580560	And like, I guess one of the first things is like, so they, when they, when they detect it,
3580560	3584400	they just, they treat it, they try to treat it the way they do regular cancer.
3584400	3588480	They, with chemotherapy, which is just like a flood your body with like,
3588480	3589440	chemicals and stuff.
3590080	3594560	And so, that makes your hair fall out and makes you sickly and sad and bummed out.
3596080	3597440	Are you in a relationship?
3597440	3598160	Yeah.
3598160	3598640	Husband?
3599520	3601840	No, just a long time boyfriend.
3601840	3602320	Yeah.
3602320	3605520	I like, like, how is, like, how, how long ago did this?
3606240	3607040	Dan, can I interrupt?
3607040	3608160	How did you guys meet each other?
3608160	3609040	Like, how do you know each other?
3609040	3610560	Twitter, like, eight minutes ago.
3611120	3613440	Like, I was just like, I'm coming to San Francisco and she's like,
3614960	3616080	that's what's great about Twitter.
3616400	3623280	The, the, but so like, what will take us, if you will, and tell me when you don't want to
3623280	3635200	talk about stuff or do, but like, like, go back to before anything was happening.
3635200	3636160	Any, any of this.
3637040	3638400	And how long ago was that?
3639360	3640000	October?
3640560	3641360	Of this year?
3641360	3641840	Yeah.
3641840	3647360	I think maybe at the end of September, I started feeling like a weird feeling.
3647360	3651680	And so I started feeling around and I felt a lump and I went into the doctor and they did
3651680	3652640	all the scans and things.
3652640	3656960	Can you tell me, can you tell me when you say, I started feeling a weird feeling and then I
3656960	3657600	felt a lump.
3657600	3658800	What is the weird feeling?
3658800	3663680	Just like something not normal, like a small, like, twinge of pain.
3663680	3666080	Like when you washed or?
3666080	3668560	No, no, just not, I wasn't touching it at all.
3668560	3671440	Just like, oh, just like, oh, you're feeling like, like, like, like, like.
3671520	3674080	Yeah, just like a little pulse and then once in a while, so I went.
3674080	3677520	And so then you started, like, investigating and then you feel a lump.
3677520	3678000	Yeah.
3678000	3680560	And so then you go into the doctor and they go, okay.
3681200	3684880	And so, okay, can you take us from there through the narrative?
3686320	3695280	Did all the scans and biopsies and it came back, the test results came back, but it was
3696160	3698000	invasive ductal carcinoma.
3698720	3701760	And they said that they wanted to start out with chemo.
3703440	3708880	And I did that, but I only went through three cycles because it made me so sick, but I was just
3710000	3710560	tired of it.
3710560	3713040	So I said, let's just go ahead and do the surgery.
3713040	3713440	Okay.
3713440	3718000	So, and at that point, so chemo is an attempt to, like,
3718720	3722640	shrink it down and the end game.
3722640	3726880	There's this sort of like elephant in the room of like the mastectomy, right?
3726880	3729200	Like, like, like, like it's breast cancer.
3729200	3730560	Is that how it works that they're like,
3732160	3736400	let's try all these things that we have to try before we do the mastectomy.
3736400	3737280	Is that the idea?
3737920	3739200	Yeah, usually.
3739200	3742640	Because sometimes they can just go in and take out that one little bit,
3743440	3746560	but then there's a chance that it could have spread to the rest of your body.
3746560	3750000	So that's why they want to do the chemo and to get everything.
3751120	3752400	And yours was double.
3753680	3755600	So at some point you're finding out that it's...
3756400	3762000	No, no, it's just I have so much family history and I don't want to have to go through chemo
3762000	3762320	again.
3762320	3763760	So I said, just take them both.
3763760	3764240	Right.
3764240	3765760	It makes it easier.
3765760	3768160	You detected it in October?
3769280	3771520	It's late September, maybe.
3771520	3774160	And so you detected it pretty early, you think?
3774160	3775280	Or do you think that you got...
3775280	3775680	Yeah.
3775680	3777920	And so you said, let's just do it.
3777920	3778160	Yeah.
3778160	3779360	Yeah.
3779360	3780640	You got to do it before it spreads.
3781600	3785600	And thank you so much for coming up here and talking about this.
3794160	3796800	Look, this is the thing that we're becoming conscious of in our culture,
3796800	3798080	like celebrities.
3798080	3801680	And the thing is we have to wait for celebrities to go through it and all this stuff.
3801920	3805840	Because I'm 43 years old.
3805840	3814640	I remember in the 80s, this is not a new thing, but what's new is the idea that we're
3816480	3817440	allowed to talk about it.
3817440	3819920	And the thing that's very...
3821120	3825360	This minefield that I want to wander into, if you're willing to with me,
3825520	3834240	is because I don't understand women's relationships with their breasts.
3837120	3838960	How the mastectomy affects that.
3838960	3842560	Because I don't understand where your relationship with your own breasts
3844320	3851440	ends and where it feels like those are a connection to other people.
3852320	3856960	And I'm a terrible interviewer, but I want...
3856960	3861760	What I want is for somebody to talk about or just educate me about what...
3861760	3863680	Because there's no analogy.
3863680	3867200	Men have prostate cancer and men have testicular cancer.
3867200	3872160	But we can walk around with one ball, and I have a ton of friends who are,
3872160	3873760	and they feel great about it.
3875120	3876400	And then there's no such thing as...
3877360	3886480	I've always wondered about that, just from 13 years old, this focus on these things.
3887920	3889760	Can I stop talking and you start talking?
3889760	3890320	Sure.
3891440	3897920	Actually, when they went in and took everything out, they also put in this deflated balloon
3897920	3899840	that's called a tissue expander.
3899840	3904000	And after everything heals, they're going to start to slowly fill it up with saline
3904000	3905600	so it stretches.
3905600	3909040	Every couple of weeks, you go in and they add a little more.
3909040	3911200	And once it gets up to be about the right size,
3911200	3916320	they can just swap it out and swap it in with a permanent replacement.
3921280	3926560	I'm not going to have that issue that you were talking about.
3927120	3930240	Amber, are you out of the woods right now?
3930320	3935600	Are you waiting to find out if you're clear or in remission or anything?
3935600	3939600	Well, everything they took out of me, they sent to a lab.
3939600	3945360	So I guess we're waiting to see what the lab has to say about it.
3945360	3946080	That's amazing.
3946080	3947440	That's really good.
3947440	3955920	I had a friend whose mother went through this and it was their aftermath.
3956880	3968320	It sounded like there's stuff that needs to be done to be candid about it.
3970000	3976800	My friend had to help her mom extract pus, liquid.
3976800	3977280	Oh, yeah.
3977280	3978480	I have drains.
3978480	3979360	I have four drains.
3980880	3981680	Sorry, say it again.
3981680	3982160	Drains?
3982160	3982640	Drains.
3983200	3985120	I'll show you if you're not afraid of blood.
3985920	3987520	Well, I am afraid of blood.
3989280	3990080	He'll pass out.
3992480	3996720	I'm very squeamish, but it wouldn't be podcast worthy.
3997680	3998880	You're wearing diapers, Dan.
4000560	4004320	But the personal experience, does your husband have to help you?
4004320	4005360	No, I can do it just fine.
4007280	4013040	There's drainage that has to happen in the aftermath of the amputation.
4015600	4017120	I'm kind of tapped out.
4024400	4028720	You were saying, so now they're putting balloons in and they're inflating these things.
4028720	4031040	Are they going to tattoo?
4031040	4032480	Is there a tattoo thing they do?
4032480	4035120	Well, actually, they were able to save all the skin.
4035120	4036160	There's a new procedure.
4037760	4039760	They were able to save all the skin.
4039760	4042240	You're going to walk out of this with like porn star boobies.
4043440	4044000	I could.
4044560	4045120	Possibly.
4046480	4047120	Well, fuck you.
4047120	4047840	Get out of here.
4049920	4051040	Try to come up here.
4053680	4056240	People are dropping $10,000 for those things.
4060720	4061440	It's pretty amazing.
4062560	4066960	My mom, she had uterine cancer and she didn't talk about it and she died of it.
4069600	4071840	When we knew she had cancer, it was in her brain.
4072560	4073920	That was because you didn't talk about it.
4074240	4075120	That was a personal thing.
4078560	4079440	I hate cancer.
4079440	4081680	It makes me angry to even talk about it.
4083200	4084000	It's a bold stance.
4084000	4084960	It's a bold stance.
4085760	4086800	I hate cancer.
4086800	4088160	I'm the hard one with Jeff Davis.
4088160	4089440	Hey, up yours, cancer.
4091760	4092240	Exactly.
4095920	4100960	What's amazing is when they're young, you get it, talk about it.
4102640	4103680	My mom didn't do it.
4104320	4110400	Makes me really want to break down in tears happily that people can talk,
4111680	4112560	get in front of it.
4113520	4114320	Get out in front of that.
4114320	4115600	It's very cool.
4115600	4117440	Is this still the number one way?
4121840	4125440	Have you become a cancer expert in the interim?
4125440	4127920	I know people get cancer and then they become cancer experts.
4129360	4130000	Not so much.
4130000	4130560	Not so much.
4131440	4135440	I remember back in the 90s, it was like the number one killer of women.
4135440	4139920	I don't know if that's changed and if that's something to high five about or not.
4139920	4141920	If it's the number two killer of women now.
4151360	4151920	All right.
4151920	4153040	Get your own podcast.
4156000	4157040	What aren't we doing?
4157840	4165200	Is there like just in terms of like, well, here's something I'm really curious about
4165200	4167440	because you say, well, just take the other one out.
4167440	4169280	Like, I don't want to fucking deal with this anymore.
4172320	4175840	What are the with that kind of cancer?
4175840	4177840	Is that typically the end of it all?
4177840	4182240	Or do you have to live with that shadow in your doorway forever?
4183200	4188400	Well, there's chances that it could come back or something else could come back,
4188400	4192960	but without any tissue there, there's nothing for it to really grab onto.
4192960	4195200	But I guess there's always a chance, but I'm not worried.
4196240	4196720	Is there...
4202560	4204480	I don't want to make fun of them for applauding that,
4204480	4208160	but I also like they can make fun of me for so many things.
4208160	4214240	But what in...
4222080	4224720	So you get that tinge and then you get that diagnosis,
4224720	4228160	then you're confronting that threshold.
4228160	4231840	Where you're going like, holy shit, the stakes just got way higher.
4232720	4235520	Like, were there things that changed in your life?
4235680	4238160	Fundamentally, like details, like anything.
4238160	4244480	Like, I started feeling differently about my stapler, my car, my garage, my dog.
4245040	4247520	Anything that you can think of that was like a flip.
4248320	4253440	No, mostly I was just in a hurry to get it all out of me and taken care of.
4254240	4257280	I was just in a rush to make sure it was all gone.
4258000	4260000	And it all went really fast.
4261600	4262800	Are you close with your family?
4263360	4266640	Do you have like, was your family there for you or was that not a factor?
4268400	4269360	Over the phone.
4269360	4271200	I mean, they all live in Indiana.
4271200	4273440	So, but I've been talking to them.
4273440	4278480	But do you feel like you went through most like just on your own or with friends or family?
4278480	4280000	With my boyfriend.
4280000	4280400	Really?
4280400	4281040	That's awesome.
4281040	4281520	Good for him.
4281520	4282080	Is he here?
4282080	4282880	Yeah.
4282880	4283840	What's his name?
4283840	4284640	Keegan.
4284640	4285280	What?
4285280	4286000	Keegan.
4286000	4286400	Keegan.
4286400	4287360	Good for you, motherfucker.
4289600	4290480	That's amazing.
4291440	4297280	Like, I've had friends that went through all alone and they did it all on their own.
4297280	4299120	And then their family came back around.
4300240	4303520	When they went through the hard part of it, like that first stage of,
4303520	4304800	oh shit, what's going on?
4304800	4306240	They worked completely on their own.
4307200	4308800	But it's awesome to have.
4308800	4312800	Well, because sickness, like we have this really fucked up, like it's an individual thing.
4312800	4313760	What do you remember?
4313760	4320000	I mean, when you were, did you have relatives that got sick in any way before that?
4320800	4322320	You handled that with a plum.
4322320	4327120	You were like by their bedside and sickness was a part of life and you were fine with that.
4329120	4332480	And so you had a support system when this happened and
4332480	4334240	like you didn't have issues with that.
4334240	4336080	Like, I don't want people to see me sick.
4336720	4340080	Well, I mean, I don't like people to see me when I look terrible.
4341120	4345360	I don't want them to feel bad about me because I don't feel that bad about myself.
4345360	4347040	Are you from San Francisco?
4347040	4349120	No, I'm from Indiana originally.
4350560	4351360	You're living here?
4351360	4351840	Yeah.
4351840	4352640	What are you doing here?
4353440	4355040	I'm just hanging out.
4358800	4362800	I run a donut shop and I don't want this to be my commercial.
4367920	4370880	You don't have to divulge anything about yourself.
4370880	4372560	Just curious what you do for a living or?
4372560	4376880	My boyfriend went to school here, so he moved here while he was going to school.
4376880	4377920	What's he going to school for?
4378560	4379440	Game programming.
4380000	4381440	Oh, yeah.
4383440	4384960	What is this?
4386960	4389040	Are you nerd shaming her heroic boyfriend?
4390320	4391040	No, I know.
4391040	4393840	I know I was nerd drooling.
4394880	4396960	I was like, that's a keeper.
4398640	4399920	I thought you were mocking him.
4399920	4401920	You thought I was going like, oh, what a nerd.
4404640	4405840	And I work with cats.
4406640	4407600	You work with cats?
4407600	4408160	Yeah.
4408160	4409840	Like actual feline cats?
4410800	4412000	In what capacity?
4412000	4413840	Um, a cat boarding facility.
4413840	4416720	Aw, a cat boarding facility.
4417600	4421680	I'm the one that can get through to all the really angry and grumpy cats.
4424000	4426720	Is it a private business that you could benefit from plugging?
4426720	4428240	Can people that are listening to this?
4428240	4428880	Oh, sure.
4428880	4431920	So if you live in the area and you need your cat boarded?
4431920	4434000	Oh, yeah, pet camp, cat safari.
4434000	4436000	Pet camp, pet safari.
4436000	4437680	Cat safari.
4437680	4439360	Did I get that right or did I just fuck it up?
4439360	4440880	Pet camp, pet safari.
4440880	4442240	Cat safari.
4442240	4442880	Cat camp.
4443840	4444560	No, god damn it.
4444560	4445200	You're fucking it up.
4445200	4445840	Cat camp.
4445840	4447040	He's doing it on purpose.
4447040	4447520	Right?
4452800	4452960	Okay.
4453760	4455840	First two words are pet camp.
4455840	4456480	Pet camp.
4458320	4460320	The last two words are cat safari.
4460960	4463920	Dan, you want to try a little jingle for it?
4464480	4465440	Pet camp.
4465440	4466880	Cat safari.
4466880	4469520	When you're going near or far-ey.
4469520	4473280	Drop off your cat at pet camp, pet safari.
4473280	4473680	Oh, shit.
4473680	4474480	I fucked it up again.
4476480	4478400	Pet camp, cat safari.
4478400	4479360	Is that right?
4479360	4480000	Okay.
4480000	4482320	Pet camp, cat safari.
4482320	4484800	Whether you're going near or far-ey.
4484800	4487280	Drop off your feline friend at us.
4487280	4490960	We'll put her in a tub and we'll rub off her puss.
4490960	4496240	If your cat doesn't have puss, don't worry.
4496240	4496960	That's fine.
4497840	4500560	We'll also just feed her.
4509600	4510960	And breakfast and dine.
4513280	4517120	We'll wave little mice in front of its face.
4517920	4519280	Pet safari, camp.
4521280	4521920	Camp.
4521920	4522960	Cat safari.

4524720	4530560	Camp, pet safari is in your face.
4530560	4531280	Okay, thank you.
4531280	4531760	All right.
4531760	4534960	Let's give a very extremely amber one.
4534960	4537200	Thank you to amber.
4539200	4540240	Thank you so much.
4548080	4550080	Thank you.
4550080	4551040	Make sure she's...
4554640	4557840	Also, Keegan, cool boyfriend.
4557840	4558560	Thank you, Keegan.
4561520	4562080	Ah, look.
4564560	4566160	Don't diminish Keegan.
4566160	4567280	Keegan could have phoned it in.
4567280	4568960	We don't know if he's a good boyfriend or not.
4570000	4571040	We have no idea.
4571040	4571840	Let's be real.
4573680	4575680	We'll find out three months from now.
4575680	4577760	Dan, I'll bring Keegan up here and give him a diaper.
4577760	4578400	We'll find out.
4578960	4579760	Oh, wait, wait, wait.
4580480	4580960	No.
4580960	4581920	No, but I just...
4582720	4586480	I'm telling you, when somebody like amber tweeted me
4586480	4588080	and I was like, oh, fuck.
4588080	4588800	We've got to bring her up.
4589760	4591440	I just heard her a plum.
4591440	4592320	I don't even think...
4595520	4598080	I just have to unplug my heart from the whole fucking thing.
4599360	4600720	I knew that she had to be up here.
4602720	4604640	I don't know how to fucking process that shit.
4605440	4607440	And she's still...
4607440	4610000	She's fresh out of the fucking process.
4610560	4611600	I have no idea.
4614400	4614880	What's that?
4614880	4616480	That's a corner of a carpet.
4616480	4616960	Who am I?
4616960	4618000	What am I talking about?
4621360	4622400	Your fascination with it...
4622400	4624160	A lot of your questions about it, Dan.
4625760	4626320	You want to know.
4627520	4628640	You're worried about yourself.
4628640	4631040	So you can't help but internalize.
4631040	4632320	When you see somebody going through that,
4632320	4635280	you wonder what you would be like going through that yourself.
4635280	4636160	I always want to know.
4636160	4639200	When people tweet me or email me and stuff and they go like,
4639200	4641360	I have this or I'm going through that.
4641360	4645360	I always want to talk to them because, yeah, I'm fucking coward.
4645360	4648560	I haven't had problems yet and I'm terrified.
4648560	4651280	If you found out tomorrow that you came down with some horrific...
4652560	4654000	I would make it everyone's problem.
4654000	4657680	I would wipe my ass across America and go like,
4657680	4659600	I got a tennis elbow.
4663280	4664880	Go to my GoFundMe.
4668800	4672000	I'm not saying if you have a GoFundMe, that's not...
4673600	4674240	Those are good.
4676880	4678400	There's a guy back there that...
4678400	4679680	I hope that's Ron Funches.
4679680	4680800	It's not Ron Funches.
4684480	4685360	Don't be sorry.
4685360	4687200	I want everyone in the world to laugh back.
4687200	4690000	Don't be sorry that you're not Ron Funches, sir.
4690960	4694800	Be sorry that you have that laugh and aren't Ron Funches.
4694800	4696960	I was on a plane, I was on the Southwest flight
4696960	4698720	from Burbank to Oakland with Ron Funches.
4698720	4700720	He slept the whole time, didn't giggle once.
4701920	4703040	Yeah, yeah.
4703040	4703920	Fuck you, Funches.
4704880	4705920	It's all an act.
4705920	4706960	You know it's all an act.
4707840	4708960	He doesn't really giggle.
4708960	4710400	He doesn't actually like people.
4710400	4713680	He's filled with whatever the opposite of giggles is.
4713680	4714640	I am going...
4714640	4716560	Funches is doing a show tomorrow if you guys are...
4717520	4721200	At Cobbs, I think 11 a.m., he's making mimosas
4721200	4722160	and he's serving brunch.
4722720	4723360	And he's not...
4723360	4725760	I don't think he's calling it Branches with Funches.
4726800	4727200	It is?
4727760	4728480	Is that what it's called?
4729200	4729760	Okay, listen.
4729760	4731520	Okay, I'll see you all there.
4731520	4732320	We're all going to that.
4733760	4737600	Spencer, did I do the double mastectomy lady interview, right?
4737600	4738480	Yeah.
4738480	4739280	Okay.
4739280	4741760	You're just supposed to bring the person up
4741760	4742880	and let them tell their story, right?
4742880	4743360	There's not...
4743360	4743840	There's not...
4743840	4745200	I didn't do it wrong.
4745280	4747600	I mean, you know, I was a little heavy handed.
4748160	4749120	I was heavy handed.
4749120	4749440	I was...
4750000	4751280	You were high handed.
4751280	4752640	So what are you yelling out, sir?
4754240	4755040	Yelling out again.
4756480	4757040	Not you.
4757920	4758960	I was looking over there.
4760640	4761600	That guy.
4761600	4762400	Pussy.
4762400	4762900	Yeah.
4763920	4765040	We're all fine.
4765040	4766720	Now what did you yell out?
4766720	4767360	Wait, now he's good.
4767360	4768160	Now he's doing it again.
4769120	4770400	People are like fighter flies.
4771440	4772800	He only says it over a laugh,
4772800	4773760	so you'll never know what he says.
4773920	4777360	He rides in on the fucking laughs of others.
4777360	4779520	Oh, the 9-11 was an inside job.
4783040	4783840	What was that, sir?
4784480	4785360	Yeah, I don't know.
4788240	4789920	He said just hurry up and crap your pants.
4789920	4791600	Just hurry up and crap your pants.
4791600	4792880	This guy came for the pants.
4792880	4793920	Let's be clear.
4793920	4796480	I am not shitting my pants
4796480	4799840	and I don't think that these things are designed to hold shit.
4799840	4801520	Well, Dan, how do we know?
4802000	4805120	We're here as a scientific experiment.
4805120	4805840	I asked for what?
4805840	4806480	Oh, there it is.
4806480	4806980	Okay.
4807440	4808480	I'm going to pee.
4808480	4809840	I guarantee, I promise you.
4809840	4810960	What time is it?
4810960	4811760	How much time do we have?
4811760	4813040	11.40.
4813040	4813840	Oh, I was pleased.
4813840	4816080	I promise you I will piss my pants tonight.
4818960	4821200	That is the Harman Town guarantee.
4824480	4827440	Dan wets himself or how much do you guys pay?
4829280	4829780	Okay.
4830400	4831120	Yeah, you guys are fine.
4831120	4832000	I don't even want to know.
4833440	4835680	Whatever it is, I'll give it back to you outside.
4837280	4837840	How about this?
4837840	4840960	If Dan's rich, if Dan doesn't pee himself in front of you people,
4840960	4842160	he was going to go out inside.
4842160	4846000	He'll write you all a personal check outside tonight.
4846000	4846320	Okay.
4846320	4848560	Spencer, that was the biggest yawn I've ever seen.
4848560	4849200	Oh, yeah.
4849200	4850400	Spencer, how are you holding that, man?
4850400	4851360	It's way past my...
4851360	4854080	You guys hear about these Chinese murder fans?
4856960	4857460	No.
4857540	4858040	No.
4859300	4862100	Seriously though, you guys hear about these dick switches?
4863540	4865140	Hear about those dick switches?
4866260	4867300	What's a dick switch?
4867300	4868100	It's a...
4868100	4869540	Let me tell you, Jeff.
4869540	4871220	It's a switch for your dick.
4872500	4873060	You put it...
4873060	4876020	Oh, it turns your sperm on or off.
4876020	4878180	It shuts your sperm right off.
4878180	4881060	That seems too bad or good to be true.
4881060	4882260	Well, let me tell you.
4882260	4886900	The implant a subdermal switch right in your scrotal sack.
4886980	4889300	I saw the Facebook diagram of the whole thing.
4889300	4889780	Oh, yeah.
4890900	4892100	I mean, what if they're...
4892100	4893540	Yeah, what if they're tickling it?
4893540	4895460	Hey, baby, let's go to my place.
4895460	4896100	Oh, shit.
4896100	4898260	Let me turn these sperms off real quick.
4898900	4903300	It's the new equivalent to wearing a condom to a party, right?
4904340	4908020	We all did that, right, in college.
4908020	4908900	I would like...
4908900	4913540	I don't want my fertility to be a binary decision.
4913540	4917460	I want there to be an air scoop on the top of my dick
4917460	4922260	that a warboy can spit gasoline into.
4923540	4923940	No.
4929940	4930820	Just in case.
4932660	4936500	I want my sperm to look like the warboy that was the guitar player
4936500	4939300	in front of the thing that was on the bungee cords.
4941860	4942500	Thank you, lady.
4943300	4945460	Wow, I don't know what you said, but I'm sure you're right.
4945460	4951700	How many women in the audience, by applause, have...
4952340	4954180	I don't even know if this is still the phrase.
4954180	4955540	This is the phrase my mom used.
4956420	4957860	Have your tubes tied.
4958740	4959380	That's guys.
4960020	4960660	Yeah, it's hard.
4960660	4961380	No, it's not.
4961380	4961940	That's men.
4961940	4964100	No, I'm talking about having your tubes tied.
4964100	4965380	Yeah, the Ethiopian tubes, right?
4965380	4966820	It's a lot rougher on women.
4966820	4969140	No, I heard nothing from out there.
4970900	4971540	I'm sorry, what?
4972820	4974100	Yeah, it's really hard.
4977460	4979060	Oh, I thought...
4979060	4979620	You tried?
4980740	4982180	I thought that was like a common thing.
4982180	4983700	My mom, like, like, like...
4983700	4985460	You could get a hysterectomy, right?
4985460	4986740	Isn't that even easy?
4986740	4989460	You tried to have your tubes tied, but it didn't take?
4994580	4997060	Yeah, you have to have had a shit ton of children.
4997060	4999380	It's not true, it's not true.
4999380	4999940	Okay, well...
5000980	5001540	Descent.
5003700	5003940	Well...
5009940	5012980	Two tubes enter, one tube leaves.
5014580	5016900	A spittle wheel, a hole in ice.
5019060	5022500	Two enlightened post reproductive women enter.
5023940	5026900	One leaves ashamed of herself.
5027620	5028580	But you're a raggedy man.
5028580	5029140	How many...
5029140	5030100	Well, calm down.
5030100	5033460	How many men in the audience...
5033460	5035140	Think that big shit is fuel.
5035140	5037540	That's not the end of the question, you fucking...
5041380	5043940	You specialness-addicted millennial.
5047940	5048900	Wait, no, stop.
5048900	5049380	Oh, shit.
5050260	5051860	I said, how many men in the audience?
5053860	5056180	It's gonna have to be harder than that.
5056180	5058260	One genexer, one millennial.
5058260	5062260	No, I was gonna say, how many men in the audience have had a vasectomy?
5063300	5064420	Yeah, same guy.
5065940	5067700	Oh, so you were getting the leap on the...
5067700	5068580	Okay, I'm sorry, sir.
5070020	5071700	He knew where it was going.
5071700	5072900	He had his male tubes tied.
5072900	5077460	You clap your hands with the vehemence of somebody who's very happy that you did that, right?
5078260	5078760	Yeah.
5080180	5081700	You had a sperm extraction?
5082260	5082980	What does that...
5084740	5087380	I mean, I know what that sounds like, but what does that mean?
5087380	5088980	It sounds amazing.
5093300	5095940	I had one today on Southwest Flight 2550.
5106660	5108980	Do you have some sperm on the side, just in case?
5110180	5111300	In the freezer.
5111380	5112980	Your freezer or somebody else's freezer?
5113860	5115380	Just next to the peas?
5115380	5116100	All right, sir.
5116100	5121300	Well, sir, so what I want to ask is the vasectomy, because from my understanding is,
5121300	5126100	you're snipping the conduit between the apparatus's generating sperm
5126100	5128340	and the apparatus of shooting it out, right?
5128340	5128820	Yeah.
5128820	5134100	So that means that any time you want, we're losing a lot of people.
5137540	5138580	Those guys are Mormons.
5138740	5147700	Any time you want post vasectomy, you could go in like five years after a vasectomy and say,
5147700	5149140	I want a sperm extraction, right?
5149140	5151140	Is that yes or no?
5151140	5152580	Yes, but it's a whole procedure.
5152580	5153460	It takes time.
5153460	5154740	You get knocked out.
5154740	5155460	Right, but yes.
5156900	5160740	I'm just saying, you keep making sperm, yeah, and so you could...
5160740	5163300	Yeah, like the thing...
5163300	5166820	Okay, so all right, well, you've had a vasectomy.
5166820	5170820	Are you by any chance just willing to come up for just for a second and just talk?
5170820	5171300	Okay.
5171300	5171940	Is that mad?
5171940	5173540	I just have a couple of vasectomy questions.
5176020	5177220	Put her diaper on.
5177220	5180820	Very, very light applause, because people don't want to make it a competition between
5180820	5183060	with a double mastectomy, lady.
5183060	5183940	You don't want...
5183940	5185860	Yeah, it's like, he's not John Henry.
5185860	5187140	He got a fucking vasectomy.
5187940	5193140	I understand, but you don't have to make him feel like a fucking pariah.
5195140	5197060	We've moved on to a different segment.
5197700	5198260	My name's Matt.
5198260	5200020	I played D&D with you guys last time you were there.
5200020	5200580	Oh, shit.
5201700	5202260	Hello, Matt.
5202260	5203300	I have face blindness.
5205140	5205620	All right.
5207060	5209300	It's called alcoholism.
5212260	5214100	So, vasectomy.
5214180	5219860	Okay, so your balls keep making sperm, and then the...
5221620	5222580	We lost Jeff.
5225700	5229380	If I can't have a podcast and just learn what I need to learn.
5230900	5232260	So, your balls keep making sperm.
5232260	5232500	Yes, they keep making sperm.
5232500	5233540	They cut the vas deferens.
5233540	5235860	So, when you come, here's my...
5235860	5237380	You come, it just doesn't have sperm in it.
5237380	5238500	Well, so we're...
5238500	5240340	But just the sperm is just sitting there,
5240340	5242740	and it just doesn't get dropped in so that it gets sent out.
5242740	5244180	Doesn't that terrify you?
5244180	5244820	No, it's fine.
5245460	5245940	It's great.
5247220	5248500	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
5248500	5251300	What terrifies you, Dan, about that?
5251300	5252580	Because I'm a child.
5252580	5253700	I feel like I'm a third grader.
5253700	5254660	What terrifies you?
5254660	5257620	Because I feel like they're down there and they want to go out.
5257620	5261860	Oh, so you feel sympathy for those trapped sperm.
5261860	5263700	I feel like, no, I don't feel sympathy for them.
5263700	5266500	I've certainly never done them any favors.
5268500	5269460	It's safer in there.
5269460	5271460	I've never been a benevolent god.
5271460	5271960	Yeah.
5273380	5275380	I, on the other hand, don't want them hanging out.
5277380	5278420	They don't last very long, right?
5278420	5281860	Sperm live and die very short, and they do this all the time.
5281860	5286020	And it's the fluid that constitutes your cum.
5286020	5286820	Seminole fluid.
5286820	5288740	That's not coming...
5289460	5290580	Who's yelling shit out?
5290580	5294420	It primarily comes from the seminal vesicle in the Cowper's Gland.
5294420	5296980	Just up in your body.
5296980	5297780	It's not in your balls.
5298420	5301380	Your balls are like the factory where these little sperm cells are made,
5301380	5304340	and you can just let that factory keep going,
5304340	5306900	and then you're cutting off the assembly line.
5307940	5311380	It's just like, oh, that's where the Prius is made.
5311380	5312180	Yeah.
5312180	5314100	But you're just like, keep making that Prius.
5314900	5316100	And it's like, they don't care.
5316100	5318900	It's not going to rust and hurt you.
5318900	5319540	That's correct.
5319540	5319780	Yeah.
5319780	5322020	So still making great sperm all the time.
5322020	5322900	Awesome.
5322900	5323940	And now I have some on ice.
5324980	5325300	Oh, yeah.
5325300	5326180	That was a great high five.
5326820	5328900	That was the weirdest high five I've ever seen in my life.
5328900	5330260	I had a cap in my hand.
5331220	5332100	Eh.
5332100	5332500	All right.
5332500	5333220	Well, okay.
5333220	5334500	So but I just felt...
5334500	5334820	Okay.
5334820	5335380	So here's the...
5335380	5335620	Okay.
5335620	5336260	One more question.
5336260	5336980	One more question.
5336980	5337380	Okay.
5337380	5337780	Okay.
5337780	5339940	So you're talking about snipping a line.
5341060	5341460	Okay.
5341460	5345620	So these sperm are used to going up through a tube until like...
5345620	5347540	Are they still trying and then hitting a thing?
5347540	5347700	Sure.
5347700	5348900	They just don't go anywhere.
5348900	5350820	So I had a vasectomy when I was 27.
5350820	5352340	So it was a long, long time ago.
5352340	5355620	And you can get them reversed or you can do an extraction, which is...
5355620	5357380	What is happening with sperm when you're coming?
5357380	5357780	They just...
5357780	5358900	Your sperm are going like...
5358900	5359700	No, they're just holding it.
5359940	5362500	Boys, we've been waiting for this our whole lives.
5362500	5363620	And then they go and they're like,
5363620	5364420	Oh, fuck.
5364420	5364900	There's a wall.
5364900	5365700	Don't think it ain't...
5365700	5367700	You tell me they don't get angry and like...
5367700	5369060	Then they die and they cry.
5369060	5369940	And it's very sad.
5371940	5373780	The new ones get made the next day.
5373780	5375620	Sperm don't think though.
5375620	5376260	Like at all.
5378260	5379620	That's what my bumper sticker says.
5382180	5383140	Sperm don't think.
5384340	5385220	All right.
5385220	5385860	Okay.
5385860	5386740	Do you want an adult diaper?
5387700	5390500	If sperm did think, what do you think a sperm would say?
5391700	5392180	Let's go.
5395300	5395860	Absolutely.
5399540	5400340	Follow that guy.
5401060	5402340	I get fascinated with sperm.
5408100	5410420	Average sperm, if you ejaculate inside a woman,
5410420	5412260	like there's hundreds of millions of sperm,
5412260	5414980	I think there's like a certain number.
5415460	5418100	And there's like the statistical number of them
5418100	5422660	that they get distracted by like calcium deposits.
5422660	5423940	Because they look like eggs.
5424500	5425380	Isn't that adorable?
5427220	5428900	Like they're on their way to the fallopian tubes
5428900	5430660	and they're like, look, there she blows.
5430660	5431940	And they're like, it's just like,
5431940	5433620	dude, it's just a fucking like,
5434260	5436260	it's just a deposit on the side.
5436260	5437380	I think that's adorable.
5438980	5440500	Because it's like, they're little men.
5440500	5442020	I think that's funny that they're like,
5442100	5445780	whoa, I'll do anything to like accomplish my goal.
5445780	5446660	But they have the numbers.
5446660	5447860	And so they get it done.
5447860	5448580	But they don't.
5448580	5449300	They all die.
5449300	5450580	And it's funny.
5450580	5454580	Matt, why at 27 did you have that done?
5454580	5456260	So I got married when I was 22
5456260	5458660	and had a daughter when I was 27
5458660	5460900	and then decided not to have more kids.
5460900	5462260	So I got a vasectomy.
5462260	5465540	And then 12, 13 years later got divorced.
5466180	5468020	And my fiance and I are going to have kids.
5469540	5470040	Wow.
5472420	5474260	Have you already or you're trying?
5474260	5474580	No, no.
5474580	5477300	So my sperm is on ice.
5477300	5479700	And at some point, that'll happen in the future.
5479700	5482020	You can see at Lincoln Center in Washington, D.C.
5482020	5484660	It's along with Matt's sperm on ice.
5484660	5486580	Big Bird and Mary Lou Renton.
5489700	5491220	My sperm is on ice.
5493620	5494980	Let it go.
5494980	5495700	Let it go.
5496980	5498340	I have an annual subscription.
5498340	5500500	I have to keep paying them like Netflix.
5500500	5500980	All right.
5501300	5502660	I forgot your first name again.
5502660	5503300	Matt.
5503300	5505940	Let's thank Matt the vasectomy from Pleasant.
5507700	5508100	All right.
5509860	5510820	We've clearly had a...
5512740	5514500	We've got to start now.
5516020	5519700	You see what we did, Jeff, is we took this show
5519700	5520820	across a threshold.
5520820	5522100	We went down our road to trials.
5522100	5524500	We met with certain truths.
5524500	5528100	We atoned with fucking death and resurrected.
5528180	5529540	We met with the goddess of...
5532420	5534180	What would you say the goddess point of this is?
5534180	5535300	The diapers.
5535300	5536660	The diapers, yeah.
5539220	5539780	I'm almost...
5539780	5541220	I don't want to excite people, but I'm like,
5541220	5543140	I just need a little more time.
5543140	5546980	And then I feel like I know I can pee in my pants.
5549700	5550340	Dan, we believe in you.
5550340	5551540	But I'm gonna need another one of these.
5551540	5553940	Whoever it is, if somebody can...
5553940	5555300	Dan, if I...
5555300	5556020	Oh, let's do a...
5556020	5557300	You know what we should do?
5557300	5557940	What?
5557940	5558580	A push?
5558580	5559060	A push?
5560260	5560740	Push.
5562100	5563940	I wasn't looking for ways to pee.
5565940	5567220	But I thank you.
5569540	5570580	You know what we should do?
5570580	5571300	Push.
5571300	5573540	Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
5574500	5577780	I'm 43 years old and I had never tried pushing.
5580420	5583380	No, I was going to say we could do a Q&A
5583380	5584900	because we're never in San Francisco.
5584900	5585460	But...
5585460	5586500	Yeah, a Q&A.
5587300	5588340	That sounds fantastic.
5590580	5592100	I'm not being sarcastic there.
5592100	5592980	It sounds good.
5592980	5593780	All right.
5593780	5595780	Should I facilitate?
5595780	5596420	Well, there's no...
5596900	5598260	There's probably not a...
5598260	5599700	I guess probably a wireless mic is...
5600260	5602180	No, but what we could do is we could maybe like have...
5602180	5603220	I could find people.
5604100	5604660	Do we know...
5604660	5606420	Do we have a wireless mic here or no?
5606420	5609620	I mean, I really fucked everything up by saying Q&A.
5610660	5611140	Yeah.
5611140	5611620	Let's...
5611620	5611860	Okay.
5613060	5614340	Back to the drawing board.
5614340	5615060	No, but what...
5615060	5615700	You know what we should do.
5615700	5619060	Dan, Dan, I could make a Q&A happen, believe me.
5619860	5620980	I could make this happen.
5620980	5621380	I don't...
5621380	5621780	I don't...
5621780	5623940	But I was only doing that because I didn't have anything else to do,
5623940	5625300	but I bet I could think of other things.
5625860	5628100	Oh, I have another thing I want to talk about.
5628100	5628660	You're going to pee?
5628660	5629300	You're going to pee?
5629300	5629860	No, no, no, no.
5629860	5630900	What?
5630900	5632660	He's going to be mid-conversation and be like,
5632660	5633620	Oh, that's happening.
5633620	5633860	All right.
5633860	5634580	There's one thing.
5634580	5635060	One thing.
5635060	5635940	I don't think...
5635940	5637060	Adam, I don't think...
5638100	5638980	You're Steve, I'm sorry.
5642660	5643300	Who's going to happen?
5644180	5653940	Adam, as a kid, he drowned in camp.
5656180	5657460	That you look exactly like,
5657460	5659220	which is why he's always so nice to you.
5659220	5660340	Dan, what was your idea?
5661380	5661940	Well, I just...
5661940	5662660	I know I had one.
5663540	5664980	I saw it straight out of Compton.
5665940	5667460	Did you guys see it straight out of Compton?
5668980	5671380	And then while you were watching it, were you like,
5672100	5673300	this is great.
5673300	5678740	I love learning about the hip-hop founding fathers.
5680260	5681540	There's Eazy E.
5681540	5683540	Oh, he was so hard.
5687140	5689300	Dr. Dre seemed rather innocent.
5692980	5694340	Oh, there's Ice Cube.
5694340	5697140	Oh, apparently he was the genius of the group.
5698100	5701220	There's some guy named DJ Yella.
5702260	5703460	There's some other people.
5704340	5705060	Boy, that...
5705060	5706100	Oh, Eazy E.
5706100	5707140	Oh, boy, he...
5707140	5709700	Man, he really did bad.
5709700	5711060	Oh, yeah, he's evil.
5711060	5711860	Oh, he's evil.
5712500	5713700	Oh, he got AIDS.
5715060	5717300	Boy, that Dr. Dre and that Ice Cube.
5717300	5719140	I never actually knew.
5719140	5722100	They were great rappers.
5722100	5723540	And great people, too.
5723540	5725460	I was like, I didn't know that.
5725460	5726820	I didn't know that about those people.
5727300	5728260	And then the credits go.
5728260	5730900	It's like, produced by Ice-T and Dr...
5730900	5732180	Ice Cube and Dr. Dre.
5732820	5735620	And I was like, well, that seems a little unfair.
5737380	5739540	Are you saying you want to freestyle right now?
5739540	5739780	No.
5740660	5741140	I'm saying...
5743140	5746580	How would Ice-T feel about that film?
5746580	5749780	I mean, if you really want to blow everybody's minds,
5750740	5753460	when you start peeing, you have to rap while you're peeing.
5753460	5755460	Yes, you have to freestyle.
5756340	5756820	Pee style.
5756820	5759780	You're saying I have to create a new character called Ice-P?
5759780	5761060	I say, yeah.
5763220	5764100	I'm gonna...
5764100	5764980	From the streets.
5764980	5768260	I want to put a beat on while your pants get peed on.
5768260	5768500	Yo.
5769780	5770500	Yo, man.
5771220	5776020	If I pee in my pants, it's not about urination.
5778020	5779940	It's about coronation.
5779940	5781380	Coronation.
5781460	5786420	It's about grand fucking shit.
5788180	5788900	Do you want to beat?
5788900	5790260	Or are you just talking...
5790260	5791780	No, I wanted to...
5791780	5794180	Mr. T, if I can interrupt you.
5794180	5795060	I have to...
5795060	5798260	Honestly, I understand you trying to be respectful,
5798260	5801300	but when you call me Mr. T, there's another guy that's called the...
5802500	5806900	Oh, is that a spot of contention where you don't like to call Mr. T?
5806900	5810100	There's certain things being worked out in small claims court.
5811700	5815220	Is it not true that he was Mr. T before you were Ice-T?
5815220	5816260	I mean, it doesn't...
5816260	5817140	Hey, look, man.
5817140	5820580	Columbus was American before Muhammad Ali,
5820580	5825060	but I know who I'm betting on in the third round.
5828900	5829940	Objection, your honor.
5830660	5831380	Made no sense.
5832900	5834420	It ain't sustained.
5834420	5836020	This isn't court, motherfucker.
5836020	5837540	This is business.
5838020	5844420	All right, in a couple minutes, I'm going to urinate my adult diaper.
5847300	5848340	I can feel it.
5849060	5850100	I can feel it.
5851300	5853620	But I never got that second water, so...
5855060	5857140	Your fault of the show goes too long.
5858420	5859460	We're going to stay here.
5859460	5861300	I don't care if we're here until Thursday.
5861300	5862740	You're going to fucking wet your son.
5867780	5868980	He might can't do it.
5869540	5870020	Is that...
5870020	5870820	Nope.
5870820	5872340	Somebody be me a water.
5872340	5873700	Thank you, baby.
5873700	5874180	Thank you.
5875620	5876900	Let's have a hand for...
5878660	5879620	Any personal...
5880900	5883620	She didn't give me that water for personal reasons.
5884420	5885380	She's business.
5888740	5893460	So the digestive business, small intestine,
5894340	5898580	absorbs water, but most of it makes it through your ass.
5900020	5904740	Comes out your urethra as your muscles deteriorate
5904740	5908100	past the point when Darwin's laws expected you to live.
5910020	5918180	Hopefully that extra waste can be absorbed by a competent...
5918180	5918740	Let me finish.
5920340	5921540	I have a question, I see.
5922500	5923700	How do kidneys work?
5924740	5925540	Aw, shit.
5927220	5930820	And, you know, kidneys are like the police, you know?
5933700	5936420	Always trying to filter everything, you know?
5937060	5941620	Like, you take in liquids and all the impurities?
5942420	5942920	Shit.
5944100	5947060	Your kidneys are there to rustle them up,
5947060	5950740	put them over the hood, read them their rights,
5951380	5954740	take them to jail, but treat them nicely.
5955700	5958820	What's the difference between a kidney and a liver?
5959860	5960420	Shit.
5960420	5963220	Well, talk about, like, the difference between
5963220	5965860	the local police and the Department of Justice.
5967860	5972020	Sometimes the liver needs to create a commission of oversight,
5972020	5975060	as in the case of Rodney King in Los Angeles.
5975700	5977220	Liver had to come in and say,
5977780	5979380	yo, kidney, what are you doing?
5980660	5983860	Well, we need to, you need a temporary injunction.
5985140	5986660	You know what turns out?
5986660	5990420	Turns out, a lot of people, it's not a popular thing to say,
5990420	5993620	but the LAPD is doing pretty well since then.
5993620	5996900	What is the function of the bladder, then?
5996900	5999860	The bladder just holds the pee, motherfucker.
6002020	6004020	That's, the bladder's just business.
6004020	6006820	Actually, I almost just peed a little bit.
6006980	6007380	All right.
6007380	6007700	Okay.
6007700	6008180	All right.
6008180	6009940	Just, okay.
6009940	6010420	Everybody.
6011540	6015060	Now, he needs complete silence for this.
6016820	6021300	Ladies and gentlemen, the MGM casino and hotel.
6023060	6023620	What if his penis?
6023620	6024980	And the Swedish American hotel.
6024980	6025860	I'm for, I'm for real.
6025860	6026980	I'm proud to present.
6026980	6028900	You are watching, you're about to watch a man.
6028900	6030500	I will tell you the minute the liquid leaves.
6030500	6032100	I'm about, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.
6032100	6033380	Don't lie, like, okay.
