0	28280	Thank you so much for coming out, day two of the Harman Town tour, please put your hands
28280	38800	together for the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
38800	50400	Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.
50400	56400	Big room full of amazing people, holy shit, amazing.
56400	61640	Thank you, you're applauding yourselves, you sons of bitches, god damn it, we're never
61640	63840	leaving this city.
63840	68120	We had a great time in Phoenix, we learned some painful lessons, mostly about myself.
68120	73640	They were good people in Phoenix, I made a complete ass of myself going out there.
73640	79200	They loved me, and I flung myself under the sharpened rocks of my own self-hatred.
79200	87760	In a regular show, a comic would come out and go, knock, knock, who's there, your mom's
87760	88760	there with that?
88760	93600	There would be a guy in the audience that would go, you suck, that's the dynamic, that's
93600	96080	what a heckler is.
96080	99640	It's completely inverted with me because I have no act, and then I come up and I go,
99640	106480	I'm a bad person, and then people in the audience go, you're doing fine.
106480	116840	We love you, we love you, season two of Community made me cry, just keep going, and I start
116840	120800	going, fuck you, fuck you pal, what do you know?
120800	122840	Dan actually started heckling the audience's love.
122840	127800	I did, I really did, and it was, the show in Phoenix went fine, but I learned my lesson,
127800	133640	it was like, you know what, let's accept some love as we go out here on the road, because
133640	138120	the automatic thought was like, we live in Los Angeles and we live in the back of a comic
138120	142560	book store, we do the show, and now we're going on the road, so your automatic thought
142560	150160	is, my mom's out there, she's somewhere out there, these are different people, they're
150160	155080	gonna judge me, or the crowds are gonna be filled with people who are like, let's go
155080	160920	see some comedy tonight, honey, who's this guy, what's he doing?
160920	168680	You all listen to the podcast, right, so we're fine, we're fine, and my only job is
168680	173480	to pretend that we're in Los Angeles, at Harman Town, every place is Harman Town.
173480	176920	I think what we found last night, to our surprise, and I think what we're gonna find as we go
176920	182480	is that the people that come to the show are gonna resemble our hometown crowd pretty much.
182480	190720	They're all, they look a lot like, I walk in the door in Austin or Phoenix and the guy
190720	195520	I make eye contact with, who's holding the thing for me to sign, is the same guy as in
195520	200440	Los Angeles, like, he might look like he could kick my ass, he might have tattoos, he might
200440	204120	have glasses, he might be short, he might be fat, he might be thin, but there's that
204120	209120	misfit quality, and then our eyes meet across the room, it happened with some guy, I think
209120	212840	his name was Jesse or something, it was the first guy I came in, there was a guy who was
212840	218520	like, hey, kind of waved at me like I worked with him, and I was like, yeah, hey, and I
218520	222680	knew, I don't work with you, but it's like the different patterns of facial hair and
222680	234080	the, just lovely, wonderful, wonderful, an army of nerds, I love it, just showering me
234080	238760	with love, and all I can do is fuck it up, all right, I'm tailspinning, I'm gonna fuck
238760	239760	it up.
239760	243440	You know what's amazing, Dan, the first time I think that you met Charlie Kaufman, you
243440	249600	guys know the writer, Charlie Kaufman, and yeah, and Harmon, Charlie came to like a screening
249600	253600	of, it was a community thing, like it was a Christmas thing, I think, and Charlie came
253600	256880	and they met, and Dan obviously really wanted to meet Charlie, and I think Charlie was like
256880	260280	happy to meet you, and they had this great conversation, they talked all day, but you
260280	264960	never saw less eye contact in a conversation, there was just two guys in the same plaid shirt
264960	273400	staring at their own shoes, like, yeah, there's a mannerism, I don't know, I don't know, I
273520	280120	those are my people, that's my people, like, we feel more than we can handle, we love each
280120	285080	other, oh, but speaking of feeling things and apologizing for things, I, this was almost
285080	291400	kettle one, but then I remembered where we were, so this is Tito's, Tito's, fucking Tito's,
291400	293600	one of the, can I make you one, you want one?
293600	300840	Yes, please, thank you, one of the 85,000 great things about Texas, they have a grass
300840	306600	roots homemade vodka called Tito's that is delicious, it's too delicious, wait, my friend
306600	309760	Ray Pruitt, who's here tonight, if I'm not mistaken, Ray, you know Tito, don't you, haven't
309760	310760	you met him?
310760	311760	Is Ray here?
311760	319800	You met him, yeah, he, I met him, when Tito started making Tito's vodka, it was just him
319800	329800	in a garage making this on his own, right, well that's the story I told you, there's
329800	334600	a weird, it's, it's pitch black back there, I don't know, and then I don't know what the
334600	341360	mics are picking up, but, but as the story goes, Tito's vodka is made by a human being
341360	348320	and not a corporation, and now it's a corporation, but it's every bit as delicious as kettle
348320	354440	one, who did not sponsor our tour, and I, we nearly had a bottle of kettle one up here,
354440	358640	but fuck those guys, it's, Tito's all the way, it feels a little weird drinking out
358640	369800	of a soda glass, but, kettle one is kind of the Nike of, of vodka's, kettle one, the
369800	377520	racist vodka, you hear that, you fuckers, fuckers had a chance, we were going to put
377520	382320	a big sticker on the side of our bus and make our bus like, shaped like a kettle one bottle,
382320	388600	we would have done anything, until we found out about that racial stuff, yeah, yeah, yeah,
388600	397560	kettle one, sitting on Nazi gold since 1945, and also making vodka, I guess that's their
397560	408320	new racket, but those in the know, kettle one, baby rapers, kettle one, more like kettle
408320	416960	two, meaning we pooped in it, you fuckers, yeah, kettle one, fuck, yeah, fuck it, here's
416960	424520	another fan, 800 reasons to be glad we're in Texas, Texas, I hate to play favorites,
424520	430160	I'm from California, I love California, California and Texas are, they're not so different, you
430160	439200	know, cows and oil, and we have like, weed and movies, and I'm not going to be a fake
439200	442960	ambassador, I'm going to come here, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm proud of, I'm very proud
442960	449400	of being a Californian, and you know, it's, California and Texas, though, like, we could
449400	456840	kick the whole nation's ass, like, we are the first and second in terms of gross national
456840	461400	product or whatever you call it on the state level, probably gross state product, it's
461400	466520	California and then Texas, like, we're basically tied, like, we would, each state could be
466520	473520	a country unto itself, Texas's history, you know, phrase six flags over Texas, you know,
473520	483000	you know, the significance of that, I do not, I do, I Wikipedia it, who's the governor,
483000	493520	Michael Dean Anderson, yeah, MacGyver, yes, the brother, brother of MacGyver, just back
493520	499520	me up, guys, I'll slip out the back and pretend that's your governor tonight, it's the MacGyver's
499520	508400	brother, they're so good, they're such good people, who is the governor, what's his name?
508400	515040	Can't hear you, Governor Bloomberg? Rick Perry, oh right, Rick Perry, the guy with the game
515040	521680	show here, Rick Perry, the idiot, he sounds sexy, I don't know, I believe he's an idiot
521680	525600	because he's a governor, I don't know how, I don't know what geniuses have ever become
525600	530360	a politician, you don't wake up in bed and go, well, my brain's so active, I should tell
530360	539080	people what to do, it doesn't make any sense, if you're smart, you make shit, or jerk off
539080	550480	and play video games, you know, shut up, Ray, the Rick Flair of jerking off and playing video
550480	559600	games just back here, whew, that's what I'm talking about. Six Flags Over Texas refers
559600	566720	to the state's history, it's an amazing history, they've been owned by, it's a territory that's
566720	573040	been owned by the French, for a brief period, the Spanish, then it was a territory of Mexico,
573040	578240	then, and I don't know what other state shares this, I really don't, there might be some,
578720	581600	none, became their own fucking republic.
586400	591840	Sparse applause for that, everyone else is like, I don't know, no, it's fucking cool, come on,
591840	596960	there's nothing, I don't think any citizens of the state are more proud of being from a state
596960	602800	than Texans, I think there's more state pride here than anyone. It's just a cool concept,
602800	607680	I love the idea that we belong to a nation that was like, it's a federalized empire,
608240	612560	at one point we had to go door to door and go, you joining us, you joining us? And Texas was like,
612560	621840	yeah, right, yeah, couple conditions, you know, you get a 50 year lease with an option to buy.
623120	627280	And we have to be shaped like a ninja star. That's fucking cool too,
627280	630880	it's the only state that if you threw it, it could take your eye out.
632800	637120	Well, Florida would hit you, even if it hit you right in the eye, it'd just bruise your eye.
637120	643440	Texas, take your fucking eye right out. That's a good point, and there's a handle on it that
643440	648800	you can throw it. You can grab it, a little kind of piece that should be Oklahoma, but it's like,
648800	656400	fuck you. It's like a sword handle. Yeah, you can cut a fucking, like a weird cake with it
656400	664080	and serve some shit on it. Walk around, stab people with it, stab Mexico. Yeah, you could be
664080	671440	like Steve McQueen and a fucking dirty dozen and kill a guy and fucking off. They were their own
671440	678240	republic, and then they made a limited agreement to become part of our little club, and then there
678240	683840	was an uncomfortable period called the Civil War. We can talk about that later if you want.
683840	692640	I am not judging anyone, and then there should be seven flags though, shouldn't it? Because it's
692640	702000	like, you get, what's that? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that. You asked twice, so you, but two
702000	709440	different. Is that that makes the six? But why not seven? Because of the amount of rollercoasters.
710160	713200	Because of the amount of rollercoasters.
719360	723440	I find one difference between California and Texas. We have very different ideas about Mexican
723440	728000	food. It's very, very, very different here. You get like, you get a chili relleno here and there's
728000	732960	like nacho sauce on it. It's very strange. I like the place that we ate. Oh no, that place was fucked.
732960	735920	Taco book. Taco Cabana, right through it. You sent us a Taco Cabana.
735920	742160	No, nobody's saying that that's authentic cuisine. Nobody's saying, I'm not a foodie.
742160	748080	Are you booing me or are you booing Taco Cabana? You're booing Taco Cabana. Thank you. We walked
748080	752320	in there. There were 17 people behind the counter and there were 17 tables all covered in shit.
753600	757840	And there was a gentleman behind the counter who was, well, he was 11 years old, I believe.
758400	760320	And I walked up, I said, I'll have a burrito. And he's like,
760320	769680	a burrito. I have a bean and cheese burrito. And so he gave me a bean burrito with a thing,
769680	777680	with a little plastic ramekin of cheese. The little plastic thing, the little, the little
777680	783840	plastic cup. There's a ramekin? Is that a word? Yeah. A ramekin. What's a ramekin? It's like,
783840	786800	it's usually like a little dish that you put butter in or a sauce or something like that.
786800	790720	Like a little four ounce. Yeah. You get your ranch dressing and I didn't know the ramekin.
790720	792880	I didn't know the ramekin was such a fucking ancient Greek name. It was like,
794000	796720	expected to snatch me up with talons and take me to Mount Olympus.
797920	804800	Ramekin was the son of Agamemnon, who was cursed to dispense three ounces of things.
804800	811520	Yeah. He stole chipotle from the gods and gave it to man in an easy to handle serving.
812080	818160	My bean and cheese burrito, ladies and gentlemen, was a bean burrito that was wrapped in foil that
818160	825280	I had to take out of the foil, undo the tortilla, and then put cold cheese into it. There's no cheese
825280	829040	in the fucking kitchen at Taco Caban and I had to make it myself. And then they give you a number
829040	833520	and I took my number to my table and was forgotten. They never, I had to go up and get my own food.
833520	838240	I don't get it. The place blows. All right, fine. Well, you have, you have their sympathy. They
838240	841920	wanted to let you know. And I'm pretty sure that I'm vegetarian. I'm pretty sure those
841920	845040	refried beans weren't and I'm going to be shitting like a goose on the bus later.
846480	850240	For my money, I'm on this special diet. I have no, I had, I had a delicious,
850240	853680	like it took some doing to make them understand how to put it in the bowl. But I got a,
853680	862240	I got a bunch of beef and chicken in a bowl with some beans and I'm about to burp it out as I said,
862240	864880	but it was good. It was on my diet. It was good. And we got out of there.
864960	868000	We did stop off at our friend's advice to a bar called Buddy's place,
868000	872800	which I quite enjoyed. Jeff, I want to be part of the honky tonk culture.
874640	880160	I can see that. Yeah. And I think, yeah, I would go to this place. Buddy's. What was it?
880160	885360	That's our, those are our two friends back there. The men's room is simply just a trough. There's
885360	889440	no mirror. There's no sink. It's just, it's just a thing. It's a manger. You could, you could,
889440	894000	you could, you could feed an ox or you could give birth to a Christ or you could be on it.
894080	896720	That's, that's, that's all there was in the bathroom.
896720	901200	I love it. And the, the, the, the, the, uh, uh, bartender was like, like everything,
901200	905360	everything was like, but not in a condescending way. It was like, and not in a colloquial,
905360	909200	it was, it was, it was like, uh, all I can drink here is a Michelob ultra. Cause I'm doing the
909200	913040	low carb thing. I got just vodka. So okay. I'll take Michelob ultra. And she was like,
913040	917200	okay, sweetie. All right, darling. Like, like everything was sweetie and darling and alternation.
917920	921440	But it was really nice. Yeah. Like, like, like, I'm not saying that she's representative of the
921440	925280	population. I know every, every town you go to, everyone wants to know like, Oh, we're, we're,
925280	930880	we're like Logan's run here. We're all from the future. Um, I'm from Milwaukee. Like I, like,
930880	936080	like, like I'm in, I'm in, I'm embarrassed to be, you know, like associated with a random thing you
936080	942400	might encounter there. But, but, but like I, I, I, I, they had to, here's what, here's what you
942400	947520	don't have in Los Angeles bars with big long ass shuffleboard, those things with you, where you
947760	952560	shuffleboard is good. That's shit. We had that. There are a couple in LA, but they're pretty,
952560	956720	they're pretty few and far between. Somebody followed us from LA just to call my shit out.
957760	964400	There's one where there's one, what I thought you said in LA. No, they're all over the place.
964400	967440	I'm saying they're not in LA. They're really buying. There's one in Culver city, I think,
967440	971680	but that's about it. They're all over the place. They were in, I found one in Portland, but like,
971840	976480	like, like my, my dad, my uncle had one in his basement. Like, like, just that, that, that gritty
976480	981920	sand shit you put on it. It's a, it's a fun game, man. I, I, everyone should have that. Not that,
981920	986160	you know, I don't want to, I don't want to get off. I don't want to do the shuffleboard show. I don't
986160	991680	care. Maybe it's time that you showed them your new dance, the shuffleboard shuffle.
998080	999360	We rehearsed this for weeks.
1001680	1009280	That was great, Jeff. Thank you.
1012160	1014800	I say give the people what they want, Dan. Yeah.
1016560	1018640	Oh, your mama raps? Oh, those are going to be mama raps.
1020000	1023840	Right. But I didn't, you notice, I didn't come out like, like doing the mama thing because I was
1023840	1027840	like, I'm getting in a rut. And I was like, what I learned in Phoenix, God bless them. They were
1027840	1032800	fucking wonderful. All they did was support me. But I came out rapping about fucking your mama.
1032800	1038160	And, uh, and they're like, yeah, well, and it's like, I didn't, I, I need to form a relationship
1038160	1041680	with the audience everywhere I go. It was, it was getting in the way. I kind of talk about fucking
1041680	1048160	your mama. And the biggest mistake I made, Jeff, getting suggestions about fucking people's mamas,
1048160	1052720	like, like acting like it was some kind of weird improv game. Like, what's your name? That was the
1052720	1057760	worst thing. My name's Steve. Uh, what's your favorite food? Uh, uh, ice cream sundaes. Oh,
1057760	1062320	I fucked Steve's mama. And he, he was eating his favorite ice cream sunda. And I was fucking his
1062320	1068720	mama and she died of cancer. Did you say she died of cancer? Yeah. Okay. It was terrible. I felt awful.
1069920	1074400	It's, I'm not an improviser. I'm not like, uh, one of your, your little who's line friends,
1074400	1078880	you know, your little, your who's he doodles, you know, that's a, yeah, yeah. These little
1078880	1083760	greg poop season, these Ryan style season, and they go like, oh, I'm going to do changing
1083760	1089200	emotions and lift the bodies and do the arms experts. Like, I don't, you used to be an
1089200	1093200	improviser though. Yeah. But I was terrible at it. And then it became a writer. And then now I've
1093200	1100160	ended up doing this cause I can't, I can't, I get therapy. Doesn't work. Is this therapy for you?
1101120	1105280	Absolutely. There's some guy, uh, Andy and, uh, and to Neil, these two people live here,
1105360	1109840	came back and interviewed Dan beforehand. And Andy really gave an awesome interview about Dan
1109840	1113760	and asked Dan a question. Why are you doing this tour? And there's no answer for that. You,
1113760	1118320	you still don't know why. I still don't know why. I just know I need this and I love this. Uh,
1118320	1122960	uh, I have lots of stuff to talk about. I just checked my notepad, but also the thing I decided
1122960	1127360	backstage based on the way things have been progressing. Like we, I want to bring Spencer
1127360	1133120	up right away, not to play D and D necessarily, but for those of you who do not know Spencer,
1133200	1136960	we are the only comedy tour that's ever traveled with our own dungeon master to play Dungeons
1136960	1143520	and Dragons. If you know him, you already love him. If you do not know him, prepare to
1144480	1146880	Spencer Crittenden. He's a national treasure.
1151200	1153760	And yes, he looks exactly like you thought he would.
1153760	1164880	Thank you for coming, Spencer. You're welcome. I don't get it.
1167440	1170800	We're getting to know him. We didn't really know him. We found out last night on stage.
1172000	1176240	Dan and I realized last night in Phoenix that we really didn't know anything about Spencer.
1176240	1179680	We knew where he lived and that he works in the back room of an Apple store.
1180400	1184240	And, uh, but now we learned that he has, uh, on both feet. What's it called?
1184240	1189840	Syndactily. He has syndact, he suffers from syndactalism. I don't suffer from it.
1191280	1199040	Sorry. I'm sorry. Forgive me. He's blessed with a, uh, thank you. He is given the rare gift of
1199040	1205200	having two of his, uh, uh, his middle toes on each feet fused together. Yeah. Yeah. Which I imagine.
1210320	1216240	Less, less toe jam, less stinky feet, 20%. Would that help you? Maybe in like a,
1216240	1220320	in like if you were a swimmer, possibly. Oh yeah. I can swim circles around anybody.
1221920	1226080	I said we vowed to learn joke. We wanted to learn one new thing about you every night.
1226080	1230880	And if you have anything in the chamber, uh, uh, you can pop it out now, but, or you can just let
1230880	1236080	it stew. I'll let it. Okay. Great. I just wanted him up there sitting there. Cause like, if you'll
1236080	1239920	save her, like, like if I'm, if I met McMahon, it's nice to have a Doc Severnson sitting over there.
1239920	1243920	Yeah. I like being able to go, what do you think about that? Spencer? Oh, that.
1247440	1248000	Yeah. I'm like,
1250960	1253600	I'm invincible. Money in the bank, money in the bank.
1255440	1260240	Can we talk about the, uh, cause we went to this wonderful honky tonk land, the shuffleboard
1260240	1264720	thing. And like, like, like, like, I want to, I want to talk about the Confederate flag thing.
1264720	1271680	Uh, uh, well, I mean, you don't have to act like I farted. This one, this one,
1271680	1276400	this one had a, there was a Confederate flag with a lady on it. What did it say? Uh, rebel rebel,
1276400	1281840	rebel lady rebel chick. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I thought it's offensive to slaves and to women.
1283520	1288560	I just, I, I, I, I, I don't know. I guess I remember one of these weird holdouts like,
1288560	1292480	where I'm like, like, I think that's fine. Like, like, like it doesn't,
1292480	1295920	it's not like a flag that has like a black person with a line through it.
1297520	1303200	It's not the same thing. Like I understand the association, but it's, but it's a very political
1303200	1308400	thing. Like that would be a bad thing. And we would all go like, okay, we've moved beyond that,
1308400	1314400	but we haven't moved beyond like, like, like struggle and political, like, like, like, like,
1314560	1321040	Texas of all places. It's like, it's the America of States. It was, it was the fuck,
1321040	1325600	it was a colony and it got like federalized and it was like, like, like, like, I don't know. There's
1325600	1331520	like, when I see that flag, I go like, uh, I don't, I don't necessarily go, oh, that person like hates
1331520	1336880	other people. Like, I kind of like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, we've all been trained to be ashamed of it.
1336880	1340720	Like it's a swastika or something. I just don't think it's the same thing. I just wanted to
1340720	1347440	mention it. I don't know how you guys feel about it as like, uh, uh, uh, progressive, uh, Southerners.
1347440	1351920	I never talked to somebody from the South that like, like, is this the South? You don't think
1351920	1358960	of yourself as a South really, do you? Sorry, sorry, sorry. Forgive me, but there's this compass.
1359680	1370400	I understand. I, I back you up a hundred percent. I don't, I don't mean to offend you. Uh, I, I, I
1370400	1378160	just meant this as opposed to the top half of the fucking country. Dan, did I ever tell the story on
1378160	1382160	the podcast or maybe if someone listens to it, did I ever tell the story about me being named Jeff
1382160	1389600	Davis and me being in the South? Uh, I don't know if you did. No. Yeah. I, uh, you know, my name is
1389600	1394800	Jeff Davis and, uh, I, my parents were Yankees. They were from, you know, like Nebraska and Ohio
1394800	1398400	when they were little kids and moved West during the Dust Bowl and, uh, never, never been to the
1398400	1403120	South. My name is Jeffrey Davis. It's not Jefferson Davis. Not Southerners. No, no one in my family's
1403120	1407680	ever been to like lived in the South, but I was in, uh, somewhere in Louisiana once and I went to
1407680	1412080	a liquor store in the morning. I was walking from a girl's place to a, to my hotel and it was a huge
1412080	1420160	long walk. Yeah. And, uh, and it was a really long walk, but it was in a very black neighborhood
1420160	1424400	and I was his only white guy walking like in kid, like little girls and boys are going to school.
1424400	1429200	White man walking. Yeah. But I looked like, I really looked like a, like a gay vampire. Like,
1429200	1435280	I was just like super tall and skinny in a black suit and super like pale and hung over and I'm
1435280	1440000	coming down the road and little kids are crossing the street to go around me. And like, I clearly
1440000	1444960	was not up to any good there. And I go into a liquor store and I, my cell phone was dead
1444960	1448800	and I wanted, uh, to make a call at a pay phone or something like that. And I went into this liquor
1448800	1453360	store and there was this kind of like, like, you know, red necky guy, like, you know, like Cajun dude
1453360	1457520	behind the counter. And I said, do you have a phone? It's like, I got a pay phone. And I said, uh,
1457520	1461520	well, you, can you, can you break some money for the change? So you gotta buy something. So I go,
1461520	1465200	okay, fine. So I got some trail mix and a Gatorade and my motherfucker, I get a six pack of beer too.
1465200	1470800	So I was perfect back at the hotel. So I get the beer and he goes, I ID. And so I go, God,
1470800	1475520	Jesus Christ. And he gives me, I get the change of the thing. I, I give him ID and then the money
1475520	1480000	for the, for the Gatorade and the beer and the trail mix. And he looks at the ID and puts it
1480000	1486000	back on the, on the counter and pushes the money, the ID and all the goods back toward me. And he's
1486000	1493680	like, thank you. I'm like, can I have it? And he's like, I said, thank you. I'm like, what? I said,
1493680	1497840	yeah, I asked, can I have it? I don't know what's, what's going on. He goes, he goes to good day.
1497840	1504480	I'm like, do I get to, what's going on? And he goes, he goes, it's yours. You go take it. I'm
1504480	1508000	like, here's the money. He's like, I don't want the money. I'm like, what the fuck is going on?
1510480	1515600	And he goes, I can't charge you Jeff Davis. And I went, Oh yeah. Okay. Well, I'm not even from the
1515600	1521120	South man. I'm Jeffrey Davis. My parents, he was even, he was even so I go, but my parents didn't
1521600	1528240	even. So my parents didn't live in the South. Even so I went, oh, racist. And he goes, even so
1530560	1535840	for real, for no fucking joke. But he leaned in and got low and fucking had a microphone. And even
1537360	1542320	so I was like, okay. And I took the stuff I'm like, I'm happy to profit off of your racism. And I,
1542320	1546160	I took the shit and I walk out and the cab, I called the cab and the cab comes and there's
1546160	1550880	a cab driver and he's a Cajun fellow too. And, and, uh, I get in the cab and he turns the meter on
1550960	1555280	and I'm like, man, that was weird. I was in this liquor store and I bought the beer and he saw my
1555280	1562960	ID and it said, Jeff Davis. And the guy turns the meter off. So you're, you're, you're, you're,
1562960	1571040	you're, you're, you're like some like really low stakes Harry Potter and take you to a magical
1571040	1575200	land where you, so tomorrow we're driving to Louisiana. I'll tell you when I get out of the
1575200	1583280	car, well, if my name isn't Jeff Davis, because shit's free, everything's because Jeff Davis
1583280	1588080	elementary school Boulevard bank, it's, it's Jeff Davis everywhere. I just, I always get conflicted
1588080	1592960	about this. Like, like, like stuff like that. Like I, I hate me some government. Like, like, like,
1592960	1598160	like, I, I can't think of anything I hate more than people telling me what to do. So if I, if I,
1599040	1604000	you know, if there's a flag that represents the idea that once upon a time people didn't tell
1604000	1608320	people what to do quite as much, it's like, you're going to erase it from history and you're going
1608320	1613360	to politicize it and overcharge it. Like, that's why I'm always like, it's not my right to like
1613360	1618000	intrude upon that. But I feel like I growing up in Wisconsin, I'm part of some weird like
1618000	1622800	federal machine that like, like, I have no idea how people feel, how they really feel. Like what
1622800	1629120	offends people. And I used to feel that way about guns too. Like, like, like that shit went crazy
1629120	1634640	recently. But I always felt like, oh, I'm, you know, I couldn't be more liberal. I'm left of
1634640	1641280	liberal. I'm so left of liberal that I seem right winged at my liberal friends because I'm so left
1641280	1649200	that I just want to, you know, burn down the White House and like build a statue of myself
1649200	1651200	pissing everybody. Thanks for coming.
1656720	1663200	Yo, yo, yo, burn down the White House. It's too white. Let's get some torches. Burn it down
1663200	1668560	tonight. We're going to march up the avenue. That's what it's for. Knock on that motherfucking
1668560	1674480	president's door and say, whose house is this motherfucker? Yeah. Who is? I don't know.
1678880	1686320	That was the anarchist rap. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure Michaela Bakunin would have signed off on that
1686320	1691520	one. But I'd say like, like, like the gun thing, it's like, like, I don't know. It's like, like,
1691520	1696640	like, it is just fuck the White House's front door. What was that? For those in podcast land,
1696960	1701920	I humped, I mimed humping the White House's front door sensually.
1708720	1714640	You know, that whole right to bear arms thing, like it seduces me. It's not, and this is the
1714640	1720080	worst time of all to ever say that, that fucking guy, like, like, like, you know, the thing happened
1720080	1726320	and then the guy said the stuff and like, it's too politically charged. But I can't get past that
1726320	1730880	concept of like, well, I don't know. There's weird shit about me that makes me go, yeah,
1730880	1735360	but I don't know who wants to be part of a machine. It's fucking dumb. Like, like, like,
1735360	1739280	I thought, I thought the whole point of this country, I thought the thing that made us sexy
1739280	1743600	was that we didn't want to be part of a machine. I thought the reason we called it the United States
1743600	1748560	was because it was like, you know, I don't know. It's, it's too, it's too politically charged,
1748560	1754480	though. They shove the shit down our throats where it's like, it's the idea of dichotomy,
1754480	1758880	the idea of a bipartisan system, the idea that you're either with one side or the other,
1758880	1762880	that's the greatest trick the devil ever played. Like, like the idea that you're not allowed to be
1762880	1767680	a single human being and go like, yeah, but I want this and I want that. Like, like, and then
1767680	1771520	you just have people from both sides telling you, yeah, but whose side are you on? Like,
1771520	1777440	because one of them is good, like a Hitler. And it's just, it's just not true, but it's like,
1777440	1782800	like, it, it, it, it, yeah, I don't know. It makes me nervous, you know? You can hear the people eating
1782800	1789680	their hot wings. Like, like, I could say anything. I could just, you know, like fuse and blow
1789680	1793040	something up. I know you don't like political conversations, but I have a, I have a question
1793040	1798400	for you. How do you feel about, uh, Obama's mother? All right. Well,
1803680	1810880	I fucked Obama's mama in the city. I fucked Obama's mama. We broke their titties. I went to Obama,
1810880	1815360	said, can I fuck your mama? He said, my name's Obama. It rhymes with mama. So I,
1816560	1824160	I wrote a llama. I fucked Obama. Yeah, that's how I feel. So you'd fuck her too.
1824160	1830320	Yeah, I'd fuck her too. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'd hit that. Are, are, are any mamas, are any mamas safe?
1830960	1836880	No, no, not for me. And I, and I, and I, and I'm blessed to live in a country where it's okay to
1836880	1842160	say that. Anyone who's mama, I want to fuck. I could say, I want to fuck your mama. President
1842160	1849680	Obama, are you listening? I would like to fuck your mama. And he, I thought the reason I voted
1849680	1854320	for him is because I think he would go, all right, well, I guess that's what he wants to do.
1856080	1860640	As opposed to somebody who would go like, what did you say? I'm gonna fucking arrest you and
1860640	1865200	put you in Guantanamo. Obama would say, I hope you fuck my mama. Maybe. I don't know.
1866080	1871760	Stimulate the package of the thing or whatever. I hope you, I hope you changed my mama's pussy.
1874080	1877760	We're supposed to be the government. We're supposed to be. You wouldn't fuck Spencer's mama,
1877760	1880960	would you? You met her the other day. She was a very lovely woman. I would, you know, I, I,
1880960	1888720	I take a crack. Yo, Spencer, I saw your mama yesterday.
1888720	1895760	Hey, it was two days ago. You think you can't do it.
1899680	1905680	That's the, that's the important thing. Humanity. I think I'd fuck Obama's mama,
1905680	1909840	but if he was here, I'd probably just shake his hand and say, thank you for running the country.
1911680	1914000	And I think he would thank me for doing a good show.
1914000	1920080	And so you just, you're just cowing to his power, to his, to his status.
1920080	1923760	Then he'd go away and he'd say to somebody going, I'd fuck that dude's mama.
1925360	1928560	Yeah, but you, you fuck members of our audience, all the mamas all the time. I mean,
1928560	1932160	like, are you saying that they're lesser than Obama, that their mamas are more vulnerable?
1932160	1938000	When I rap about fucking your mama, I'm using the royal, your mama.
1938000	1948000	I don't mean, I know that many of your mamas are dead or dying. Yeah, I can, you can hear them.
1948000	1953760	Yeah, Dan, Dan, yeah, my mother died when I was 13. You want to, you want to fuck her?
1953760	1960000	Yeah, I don't, I don't want to get specific. It's like the art form of wanting to fuck your mama.
1960000	1965120	Your mama's bigger than any individual.
1970320	1976160	What? Yes, I'm saying yes. She's literally bigger than any individual.
1977040	1982960	Yes. That's when your mama represents the collective. She represents the whole collective.
1982960	1986480	I don't want to say that she is. I don't want to say your mama is fat and important to me,
1987440	1989120	but she's bigger than any individual.
1993360	1996720	When your mama occupies my thoughts, she occupies my thoughts.
2001040	2006880	There are agrarian societies that would consider her in charge of the cycles of the moon.
2008720	2013280	She's, and I would, and people would be honored to nail her.
2014080	2018640	I think it was nice that Eric Idle came on our goodbye show in Los Angeles and sang about fucking
2018640	2024160	your mama. Did you guys hear that? That was amazing. We wrote, we wrote a Monty Python member,
2024160	2028560	Eric, our buddy. We wrote him a song that I was like, he's, he's never going to sing it. And it
2028560	2035040	was just about fucking dad's, Dan's dad and Nuzzle and his nuts. Dan and I were just in heaven. It
2035040	2039680	was the greatest. We wrote a song for a Monty Python guy. Yeah. Like we wrote that song. I was
2039680	2043760	like, well, fuck your mama and Nuzzle was nuts. And then a guy from Monty Python sang it. And it
2043760	2052000	was a, yeah, humble brag. All right. Let me, let me, let me check my notepad. I just want to see.
2052000	2057120	There was a couple of Texas things while we're here that we can't talk about anywhere else.
2059520	2063840	Do you think our angry bus driver is here in the audience? I don't know. Morgan is our driver here.
2064960	2069440	Nope. Okay. Can we talk about our angry, angry bus driver? This guy's complicated.
2070640	2075520	We're unsure. He has a sense of humor. I just don't know what it is yet. That's, uh,
2075520	2084080	I detect, here's my, my, my, my look like, like, I, I feel like at one point he was driving like
2084080	2090800	Gallagher or Louis Anderson in a bus. And then he was like, he was full of joy in life. And it was
2090800	2096560	like, Hey, you like smashing watermelons? Maybe you should smash an orange. And Gallagher was like,
2096560	2103040	keep driving, you fucking lackey piece of shit. And he, and he, he looked forward and then like,
2103040	2109040	he did an x-ray of his heart went, and then he became his current personality. Well,
2109040	2114080	I don't know. He, apparently on that bus, he's driven, he's driven Slayer and Styx quite a bit,
2114080	2118240	which I think is pretty cool. And I think he, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he had very nice things to say
2118240	2123680	about both, both bands. Like, I think he's a, he has this gruff, like, he just like, he, he said,
2123680	2128320	he does things like, like we're all hanging out in the bus and then it's driving. And then he, he,
2128320	2132800	he, he appears from one of the bunks and then comes up to the front and he goes up to the,
2132800	2136560	for a while we had another driver because it was too long of a drive. And then he goes like,
2136560	2143520	Hey guys, little bit of a tour bus etiquette 101. If you're, if you're gonna,
2143520	2147600	if you're hanging out and someone's sleeping in the back, close the door between the things.
2148560	2155600	So close the door and the, with the director of, of the, of the movie said,
2155600	2159920	Hey, a little bit of humanity, one-on-one, if you hate your job, stop doing it.
2164560	2167520	See, I feel weird talking about this because we're going to be,
2168400	2171840	this guy's going to be behind the wheel for an entire tour around the country,
2171840	2176480	including the Northeast during January. Yeah. And he's going to, if he, if he decides,
2176560	2181840	he's going to go, you know what? Fuck it. He's going to go, Christopher walking from
2181840	2187280	Andy Hall on this. But you know, I don't know. Yeah. I, well, what do you want me to do?
2187280	2192240	But I have to say that aside, he, he, he keeps it between the lines and he hasn't scared me yet,
2192240	2196000	which there's some scary drivers out there. So I've gone to sleep in that bunk and I've
2196000	2201280	never felt like the telltale signs of a bad driver. Yeah. All right. Well, a new update
2201280	2205920	in the next city where we're forming relationships that we never knew. He looks exactly like Jeff
2205920	2214000	Daniels and he's, he's, he's objectively ashamed of it. Uh, like, I'm going to be ashamed of,
2214000	2220240	I know that's what I told him. I was like, some Jeff Daniels hater over there or maybe
2220240	2225680	a guy who looks just like Jeff Daniels. And he's like, uh, with a, with a pinch of cool. Yeah.
2225680	2232320	He looks like the little, little full house, Dave Cooley. I'm only putting this on record.
2233120	2235840	Come on. Jason, get up here. No, I'm kidding. He's not here.
2237520	2242640	Oh, God damn it. Uh, Jeff, why don't you like the song? Hey, yeah. By outcast
2244560	2246560	when everyone else in the world loves it.
2251520	2257120	Ambushed, ambushed. I don't like it. It's a bad song. No, you know, it's not a bad song.
2257120	2260320	It's a toe. No, no, no, no, no. There's, there's a very good reason why I hate it. I don't like
2260320	2266160	popular things to begin with. I kind of have a very uncharming, unnecessary, uh, version to
2266160	2272080	popular things. Like I would say what I must think it's a bad song. I think,
2272080	2275840	I think it does exactly what it ought to do. It's a pop song. It's a popular song. It should be,
2275840	2279200	but we used to go to this one little bar restaurant in my neighborhood in Los Feliz.
2279200	2282800	Shut the fuck up. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm a little on edge.
2282800	2289840	Hey, yeah. Hey, yeah. I guess it got it. Oh, I think you boop it. I put my trousers in. Oh,
2289840	2294560	I think I pooped it. It's okay. You don't know. It's a fuck. It's not a good song. It's a shitty
2294560	2299680	song. Here's my problem with that song. You couldn't go anywhere for 17 months without hearing
2299680	2304800	that thing 15 times a day. You just like, I don't like over, also like I would never walk on a plane
2304800	2308480	and be carrying the DaVinci code. I would, I would blow my brains out. I wouldn't, I don't want to
2308480	2312480	have a book and see 15 other people reading the same book. Does that make me cool? No,
2312480	2316480	I just don't want to, I'm never going to read the Celestine Prophecy or any of that shit.
2316480	2321920	I, I'm sure they're great books, but I just don't want to, like I, I, it's not a sexy thing. I'm not
2321920	2327600	boasting. I shouldn't be like this. All right. I just wanted to jump. I made a list of stuff to
2327600	2331920	talk about. I think it was overplayed for me. I didn't need that much of it. I think it's a real
2331920	2337920	toe tapper. No, you don't. I just suck an ass. Well, I'm not sucking ass. Did I ask them first
2337920	2344880	if they like outcast? No, you, you go to them. No, no. Did we drive past a sign that said Austin
2344880	2349920	gateway to outcast lovers? I didn't know that they, I don't know how they feel. I know how,
2349920	2354880	I know how the world feels because it's a fucking number one song forever. Like everyone loves it.
2354880	2358400	And, and a like a lot of their stuff and they're always having a great time. You always hear them
2358400	2362480	having a great time in their music. I fucking love outcast. I will, I will take, I will take the
2362480	2367280	outcast. Hey, a song any day of the week over anything that Gwen Stefani or no doubt sings.
2367440	2375600	That's too particular. This guy's too particular. Anyways, moving on. Next topic.
2376480	2381360	Why am I under fire? No, no, no. I wrote down a list because I was a little nervous. I wanted
2381360	2385200	to be able to talk to them about stuff. And that was like, it was like, Hey, I was like,
2385920	2392720	I wanted to confront you about, Hey, in front of people. There's certain popular bands that
2392720	2397680	people love that I hate. And it's, um, I'm, I am convinced that if you give me five minutes,
2398320	2403200	I can turn the most diehard rush fan and convince them that they actually don't like rush.
2405120	2410080	Yeah. All right. Who's the biggest rush fan? What? You don't want the biggest rush fan in the
2410080	2414720	audience to come up here? Is there anybody? No, no, because now it's been front loaded and they're
2414720	2418720	going to, okay. Yeah. Nobody's see how respectful they are. Also, you know what? You know what? I
2418800	2429600	don't like Led Zeppelin. No, I hear more applause than booze. No, I think, I think it's a great,
2429600	2433120	I think it's a great band. I love the band, but Robert Plant is a screechy ass.
2434880	2439200	And when you see film, when you see film him playing and he's swinging his microphone around
2439200	2443600	and he's stuck stuff in his pants with a sock and he's, or maybe he's got a giant cock. If you have
2443600	2448240	a giant cock and you're wearing those pants and stop being so insecure and going, and then, and,
2448240	2451680	and looking over at Jimmy Page, he's doing nothing but standing there playing guitar
2451680	2454880	and minding his business. And every time you see Robert Plant look over at me, you can tell he
2454880	2458560	hates him. He's jealous of the fact that he can do that. Right. So you, you, you're, because I was
2458560	2463120	confused by your reaction. You are, you're hardcore Zeppelin to the point where you can be anti Robert
2463120	2467280	Plant, right? Yeah. Okay. All right. The band is great. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the best
2467280	2472800	band with the worst singer, I think. And not the worst singer. They, yeah, like this is great. Austin,
2472800	2481040	bringing people together. He was the hardest boomer, but then I'm going to, I'm going to pour
2481040	2489040	this guy a Tito's. Can we get a glass up front for this guy? All right. Moving on. Next item on my
2489040	2492720	day. You thought you thought you, you thought I was going to die. I made friends. No, no, no, no.
2492720	2498160	Fuck this guy in our lifelong buddies. Now I wasn't setting you up to be, to suffer anything.
2498320	2504880	I wanted to, I wanted to have a relationship with these guys. Moving forward and doing that.
2505520	2512880	Jeff and I have been friends for probably, I will just round up 15 years today, this morning,
2512880	2519840	because we've never been on tour ever. We had a special milestone moment. It's never come up.
2519840	2524080	Why would it ever happen in an IHOP bathroom? Jeff and I took our first shit together.
2524080	2529600	Not together. Next to each other. Different toilets.
2529600	2534320	I've known him forever. It's like, I came in the bathroom. I know he's in there. Like,
2534320	2540320	I'm not going to ignore it. You came into saying a little sign like boopin' in an IHOP bathroom.
2541360	2544400	It's going to make your dreams come true. Yeah, something like that.
2546400	2550880	It's probably hard to see, but these are Dan's feet under the toilet.
2550880	2557280	Yeah, it's probably hard to see for some of you. Have you seen that at all?
2559520	2563200	I know you hate being told your shoe's untied, bro. I'm not saying that, but your jeans hang
2563200	2567840	down low. And when your jeans are long, you wear them long enough to be the little seam, the bead
2567840	2573520	at the end kind of rips off. And so mostly that's just a piss mop that you've got. It's just hanging
2573520	2579520	out right in the kill zone underneath the toilet at an IHOP. I guess I just love Texas.
2581360	2586400	I trust their germs to be as big as everything else and not be able to get into my bloodstream.
2586400	2590640	What was it called? Fort Stockton? Fort Stockton, I believe we were in. Fort Stockton IHOP? Yeah.
2592320	2601840	Spencer, keep it down. Sorry, guys. I heard his little flip-flops. That's all I wanted to say.
2601840	2611280	I take adorable shits. They're like unicorn tears. Sploosh.
2613440	2618800	That's amazing. We're on the road. It's our second show in and shit's going down.
2623920	2628560	All right, so I've lost track of time because we love these people so much.
2628640	2632720	That's 1123. What does that mean? When did we go on? We went about like 1040?
2634480	2641440	All right. Well, I don't know. I feel like we need that audience participation level of our show.
2641440	2646080	Like, I don't want to force it. I don't want to say, who's allergic to vanilla? I am. Oh,
2646080	2653440	let's do a rap about that. I learned my lesson. But I just want to feel, you know, like.
2653440	2657440	Last night we came up with, there's a little kind of anthem that we, you know,
2657440	2662160	we're trying to like write lyrics to. Oh, that's yeah, that's a good point. And we brought a woman
2662160	2668080	up on stage and we like, she was like the dido to Dan's Eminem and she did like the sing-along hook
2668080	2673920	to it. Is there any, I would limit it to young ladies unless they don't step forward. Is that
2673920	2678080	sexist to limit it to the ladies? Could be a guy, could be a girl. I mean, it's a very masculine
2678080	2683440	stage right now. And there is a woman that has it. Does anybody feel like they can carry enough of a
2683520	2690480	tune to do like the Rihanna hook? Okay, that hand went up pretty emphatically. That's the one I saw.
2690480	2695120	What is that? Yeah, come on up if you like. Let's welcome her to the stage.
2702240	2708400	What's your name, young lady? Jen Brown. Jen Brown, all right. Jen Brown.
2708560	2714800	Her name rhymes with the with Harmontown. So did you listen to the last podcast when we were in
2714800	2719200	Phoenix? I missed the last one. Okay, well we came up with this refrain. Yeah, it was released like a
2719200	2725520	couple hours ago, I think. Yeah. Do you want a seat or are you comfortable standing? Okay. Jen,
2725520	2730080	are you a singer? Is that what you do? I'm not primarily, but I use the microphone, Jen. You're
2730080	2735840	a singer. I'm not primarily, but. Is that mic on? Yeah, yeah, okay, go, go. All right.
2737600	2742240	Is that the Zeppelin guy? This guy's mercurial as shit. Zeppelin guy may have to come up. Raise
2742240	2750160	your head for this guy. All right, the refrain that we landed on in Phoenix was. You want to sing it
2750160	2760000	for her? Yeah. I'll run it through. Come on down to Harmontown. Turn your frown upside down.
2760720	2769040	He is yellow. Poop is brown. Come on down to Harmontown. Come on down to Harmontown.
2770720	2774720	Sorry, sorry. You're brown upside down. Yeah. It's come on down to Harmontown.
2775600	2780640	Turn that frown upside down. P is yellow. Poop is brown. Come on down to Harmontown.
2780640	2792480	All right. From the top. Come on down to Harmontown. Turn that frown upside down. P is yellow. Poop
2792480	2800080	is brown. Come on down to Harmontown. Yo, Texas. I hope I don't wreck this. I'm trying to freestyle
2800080	2806000	coming off Phoenix. I feel friend tick. I want to freestyle for you. I want to rap for you.
2806000	2813040	Not do it like doo-doo. I want to, I see, feel it coming inside. I feel terrible. I'm doing a
2813040	2818400	terrible job. I'm always terrible at rapping. It doesn't matter because we got this hook and
2818400	2827680	that's the pancake batter. Come on down to Harmontown. Turn that frown upside down. P is yellow.
2827680	2838080	Come on down to Harmontown. My weakness to my knees. Struggling like a hero. Staring at the trees.
2838080	2845600	Calling to the sky. Austin, please give me strength. Rap, please. I'm a terrible rapper.
2845600	2852640	Don't know what to do. All I can ever do is talk about my poo. All I want to do is hang out with
2852640	2859680	everybody. But I can't do it because I feel like a piece of shit. Come on down to Harmontown.
2859680	2868080	Turn that frown upside down. P is yellow. P is brown. Come on down to Harmontown.
2868080	2878320	We're gin brown. We're gin brown. Gin brown in Harmontown. Gin brown. Gin brown. Let me see you
2878320	2892640	work that ass around. I said let me see you work that little ass around. Yeah, yeah. The guy that
2892640	2898800	liked Zeppelin was arguing with you. He started to cheer at you and hiss started to boo. But then you
2898800	2905360	said Robert Plant was a dick and then you guys hugged and it kind of made me sick with jealousy.
2906160	2911520	I'm your friend. I don't want this to be the end. Yo, man. I'll stick to you. I'll stick with you
2911520	2915360	through any kind of weather. You know, it was today at an IHOP. We both took a shit together.
2917520	2922240	You can't frown at Harmontown. Never frown when you hear my little diamond poopies popping down.
2923120	2931200	Flip plop. Flip plop. Flip plop. It's hip hop booby. Flip plop doodies popping. Yeah,
2931200	2938400	they were little cuties. Tootie fruity. Fresh and fruity. I took a shit with you. Now we're together.
2938400	2947920	I had a waffle too. Come on down to Harmontown. Turn that frown upside down. P is yellow.
2947920	2954960	Boop is brown. Come on down to Harmontown. Go again. We should do it again.
2958640	2963120	Do a booth fade. Down to Harmontown. Let's get the shot where everyone's slow-mo. Okay. So yeah,
2963120	2965680	yeah. So pretend you're in slow-mo right now. It's okay for the camera. We're at the camera.
2965680	2972320	Reach for me like you want to touch me. Yeah. Like you wish you could. Slow-mo. It's totally
2972320	2978160	organic. Yeah, it's totally natural. Pretend what's happening is not weird.
2982400	2987760	Every city I go to, it's the same. All the faces and names blend together.
2987760	2996320	Flame. Oh, oh, oh, the weariness of the road. Oh, so hard to be adored.
2997280	3004800	Oh, how will I sustain it? What drug can take care of this? All these people making me drown
3004800	3011760	in my ego piss. They want to love me and I don't care them enough, but I want to do shit like snuff
3011760	3020240	or love, I guess. I'm a bad rapper. We made friends in the crapper. Yeah. Yeah. I use the toilet
3020240	3030000	papper. Yeah, that's cool. All right. Don't panic. Keep it cool. Keep it cool. Yeah. Yeah.
3030000	3034080	You're in a place where friends come together. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
3034080	3038640	Everybody cool. Go with the flow. Keep it cool. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Spencer.
3039920	3048240	What? That was MC Spencer, everybody. Yeah. All right. Well, let's have a hand for-
3048240	3054240	Jen Brown. Jen Brown. I thought that worked out very well. Jen Brown.
3058640	3062560	All right. Well, let's play Dungeons and Dragons. Let's do this. All right.
3064560	3068960	We're going to need Erin to come up here then. Can you bring Erin McGathey to the stage? Erin
3068960	3075520	McGathey. Oh shit. Wait, you know what? You know what Jen gets? It's Jen Brown, right? Jen Brown.
3076000	3082560	She gets a fucking limited edition. Dan Harmon's. Water damaged. We have two books left. All the
3082560	3087440	books were sold. So you get one. There's two water damaged Dan Harmon's. He'll be perfect when you're
3087440	3097680	dead. Especially dropped in the bathtub for you. Twice as wide as a normal book. Thank you, Jen.
3105520	3116160	And Erin McGathey takes the stage. Dan's girlfriend. Really, really quick. Can I
3116160	3121600	premiere my new character sensitive t-shirt gun? Yes. Yes. Sensitive t-shirt gun. Sensitive t-shirt
3121600	3127520	gun. All right. Hey everybody, who doesn't have enough money to buy a t-shirt?
3128160	3132240	Who doesn't have a lot of money?
3145760	3152880	Sorry, stage left audience. Sorry, sorry. I said premiere. It was the first time. Next time I'll
3153840	3157760	have a stronger arm. Erin, you're 12 years younger than me. I'm not hip to the
3157760	3162800	scene. What? Was that Jen Brown girl? Was she a manic pixie? Whatever you call it.
3165840	3171520	I saw the short hair and the glasses. We just did a two episode arc on my podcast about the
3171520	3176320	manic pixie girl. That's why I'm asking you. I was in the back grabbing t-shirts. Oh, you didn't see her?
3176320	3182800	No, I saw her. I don't think it's so much about looks. I don't know what any of these phrases
3183360	3187600	she would definitely in a she would be booked. I think in a movie she would be cast as a manic
3187600	3191840	pixie girl. She's very cute. Looks very smart and creative. Sorry, she kicks your ass.
3194480	3203440	Go on. Yeah. Very, very pretty and adorable and creative. So she may be cast as that. I get
3203440	3208480	confused. Okay, so the things I get confused about manic pixie chick confederate flags,
3208480	3212880	second amendment, and the word hipster. Somebody coughed the word hipster when we were talking
3212880	3218400	before. You were you were tired of music or someone went hipster. Yeah, I never know what
3218400	3224000	that means. Hipster means poser. Hipster means like I think we're from LA and there's you know,
3224000	3228400	it's Silver Lake, which is like the what's the the area in Brooklyn that all the hipsters live?
3228400	3232720	Williamsburg. It's like the Williamsburg of LA. And it's just a lot of dudes and like with
3232720	3236480	it's 90 degrees out, but they still have a beard and a scarf and then a beret and like a
3236960	3241600	it's about affectation. It's about somebody who puts too much attention into how they look. I
3241600	3248240	have a personality. I swear ask me about it. My name is Sunday with three wise
3250480	3256000	because it's really Dave. Look, that's a good friend of ours and he's going to finish that
3256000	3263200	screenplay. All right, Spencer, do you want to recap? What were we going to give you these first?
3263760	3267360	Spencer is dispensing Dan's that one, the character sheets.
3269120	3273760	Last night in the tour bus after playing a playing D&D now for months with Spencer,
3273760	3278400	I've never actually looked at my character sheet and I got a tutorial from Spencer and explained
3278400	3283360	all of this, all the information and I'm very excited about it. Take it away, Spencer.
3284240	3290800	When we last met, our heroes had just been looking skyward at Admiral Darkstar's Black Armada,
3290800	3295920	pouring through the rift. The ships launched out legions of black metallic cylinders before
3295920	3301200	sailing westward. Realizing his camp may be in danger, Mango and his barbarians teleported
3301200	3305920	swiftly away to warn the others. Left in the middle of a few of the mysterious cylinders,
3305920	3311520	the party inspected them for a bit before they began making strange noise and hovering with menace.
3312320	3317360	Not sure how to proceed, the heroes cast shot through and urinated their way to victory.
3317360	3322960	As they stood among the battered constructs, they hoped that butts camp would be safe.
3347360	3350320	And you have 10 less because you just got out of a fight last time.
3350320	3352720	Well, why didn't you write it down on my character sheet, Spencer?
3352720	3353840	Because that's your job.
3357200	3358160	Dungeon snap!
3366160	3370480	Wait, but after after every show, you come up and take my character sheet away from me
3370480	3373360	and put it in a little trapper keeper and I never get to see it again.
3373360	3374240	That's true.
3374320	3376480	We don't we don't have pencils and erasers. You need an assistant.
3376480	3377440	That's not my fault.
3378960	3379760	We need to get him a team.
3379760	3381360	Spencer, this is day two. Why are we fighting?
3382480	3383600	Just calm down everybody.
3384320	3386240	So I don't have 40. I have what?
3387120	3389840	Right now you're at 11.
3389840	3392160	So how do you get your hit points back? Just rest and...
3392160	3396640	Well, last time we met, you actually put on a healing pendant in anticipation of healing.
3396640	3398320	My healing pendant was booting up, you said.
3398320	3399680	It's starting to, yeah.
3399680	3402480	You can feel the rejuvenating forces flowing through you.
3404240	3406640	Your hit points trick trickle upwards.
3406640	3409680	To... to how many?
3409680	3410240	You don't know.
3411600	3413440	I'll tell you in the future. It's still going.
3413440	3413920	All right.
3414480	3419600	Looking around you, you realize that you're actually in the remains of some long destroyed village,
3419600	3424160	only the foundations and the charged skeletal wooden frames of several buildings remain.
3424720	3429200	You can tell that some time has passed between the raising of this town and now,
3429200	3434880	because several green grass shoots and delicate tendrils of stems have begun overtaking the ashy
3434880	3438800	black structures. You wonder what wrought this devastation and why.
3439920	3443760	Mulrain seems tense, worried, and has a far away look in his eyes.
3445760	3446640	She's a he.
3446640	3448880	Yeah, I keep forgetting. She's a dude.
3450720	3453760	What's wrong, Mulrain? You seem tense.
3455040	3456400	With a far away look in your eyes.
3456800	3464080	Hi, gentlemen, comrades, I'm going to fashion some more arrows.
3465520	3468240	On the other side of the village, I know that you'll remain here.
3468240	3472800	I'll be back in 10 shakes of a swallow's birthing.
3475760	3476720	That seems weird.
3476720	3478080	He departs quickly.
3478080	3479120	She seems evasive.
3479760	3480320	He?
3480320	3480960	Uh, yeah.
3483920	3485760	Guys, I get it. I look like a girl.
3487280	3489600	I, by the way, merch is available after the show.
3491600	3495040	T-shirts, everything. We'll sign it. We'll sign everything.
3498800	3500480	That was the sound of Mulrain leaving.
3501760	3502960	The two of you remain.
3503520	3507200	I detect magic around here.
3507200	3511680	You detect the faint straight traces of dangerous evocation magic,
3511680	3513600	the most deadly and destructive force.
3514400	3514880	Uh-oh.
3516880	3520960	So there's dangerous magic lurking around the skeletal tendrils?
3520960	3524640	I'd say there's the echoes, maybe the remains of past cast magic.
3526480	3529760	All right. Well, we should head to my dad's camp.
3529760	3533440	Yeah, because he's going there to make sure his camp is safe.
3533440	3534400	We should come to his rescue.
3534400	3536640	I know you and your dad have a troubled past.
3536640	3537120	Yeah, yeah.
3537120	3538800	But I'm a barbarian. He's a barbarian.
3538800	3540560	You're part barbarian, more or less, aren't you?
3540560	3541920	Sort of genetically.
3541920	3542560	Kind of, right?
3544560	3545760	Which way did they go?
3546560	3547840	You don't know. They teleported.
3547840	3548320	Oh, right.
3548320	3548960	They teleported.
3548960	3549760	But we were there.
3549760	3550800	Mm-hmm.
3550800	3551280	Right.
3551280	3553040	You also probably don't want to leave me.
3553840	3554800	No, we'll get you.
3554800	3555840	What are you doing?
3555840	3556880	She's carving arrows.
3559680	3561200	I don't do stuff now.
3564480	3567680	We take off back to the butchered lot encampment.
3567680	3571440	All right. You two set off, but not before Sharpie trips over his own two feet
3571520	3572560	and falls flat on his face.
3573680	3577040	As you pick yourself up, you realize you didn't trip over your tone two feet,
3577040	3579600	but instead a large tattered tome.
3580560	3581520	A tome?
3581520	3582560	A tattered tome?
3582560	3583360	That's a book.
3583360	3584480	Yeah, I know it's a book.
3585600	3587600	I'm helping everyone out. I'm just explaining.
3589040	3591360	What do you think I was doing in 89, getting laid?
3592880	3594160	I know what a tome is.
3596800	3597680	Pick it up.
3597680	3598640	I pick it up.
3598640	3599600	You pick it up.
3599600	3600480	I look at it.
3600480	3601200	You look at it.
3602080	3603040	It says journal.
3605600	3607840	The edges are burnt and blackened.
3607840	3608960	The cover is worn.
3610160	3613600	It seems strange that it survived this intense fire.
3615280	3616000	Is it magical?
3617040	3620400	You've detected magic and you didn't detect magic coming from it, but...
3620400	3621520	I open it.
3621520	3622400	It's not very polite.
3622400	3623440	Somebody's journal, man.
3626720	3629120	The first entry reads dead.
3629840	3630560	All dead.
3631200	3632480	My children.
3632480	3632880	Gone.
3633760	3636000	Five bright souls snuffed out in an instant.
3636640	3640400	No mother should be forced to endure such horror, let alone be forced to watch.
3641200	3644240	Their screams, their heart-shattering screams,
3644240	3647280	the crackling flames, the smell of burning flesh.
3647280	3650480	I died five times that night, and yet I'm still here.
3651840	3653360	Even this place is gone.
3653360	3656320	We had a 16-hour bus ride from Phoenix, you guys.
3657280	3657920	That's awesome.
3658080	3660400	I... I can't.
3661280	3662720	The journal entry ends there.
3662720	3664560	Spencer, everybody, that's good stuff.
3666960	3667520	Holy shit.
3669120	3669680	Do I leave?
3670960	3671760	Was it signed?
3671760	3672960	No, no, you're staying.
3672960	3673600	Was it signed?
3673600	3674080	Is there a name?
3674880	3675760	There is no name.
3678320	3681280	Well, I think we should keep this and restore it to whoever...
3681280	3684480	It's a huge clue in the mystery of whether or not a bunch of people died here.
3686320	3687760	I think I solved the case.
3687760	3689760	It may have multiple pages.
3689760	3692240	Oh, oh, oh, I turned the page, Jesus.
3695120	3696640	If only I were stronger.
3697920	3699360	If only I were male.
3700560	3701920	If only I were male.
3701920	3703440	The entry ends.
3703440	3704080	It's a woman.
3705680	3707440	Okay, I turn every page.
3710320	3711520	You read the whole thing.
3711520	3712560	Strong move.
3715200	3717040	I found a way to carry on.
3717040	3719200	I couldn't protect them because I was weak.
3719200	3720400	I am weak.
3720400	3722000	Curse this female form.
3722000	3723200	Curse my cowardice.
3723200	3724400	My inaccuracy.
3724400	3725520	But that's over.
3725520	3726240	All of it.
3726240	3727840	I found an artifact.
3727840	3729920	They say it's cursed, but I don't know why.
3729920	3731680	Who wouldn't want this power?
3731680	3732560	The entry ends.
3733200	3734800	I'm assuming you're flipping through.
3734800	3735440	Yeah.
3735440	3736560	The next entry.
3736560	3737840	The last entry.
3739120	3740080	It worked.
3740080	3742320	I can feel my old self drifting away.
3742960	3744960	My memories seem fainter, weaker.
3744960	3746320	The belt were just fine.
3746880	3749200	Now no one can trace me back to my roots.
3749200	3750240	My past.
3750240	3753280	I thought I should change my name to something more masculine.
3753280	3755680	To honor their spirits, I came up with mole rain.
3759280	3762640	Mole from the elvish word for one who survived great calamity.
3763280	3764160	Rain.
3764160	3767520	God's mercy for the rain that should have come to save my children.
3768800	3769760	My dear children.
3771360	3772240	Make that noise again.
3774560	3775600	Yeah, the coming back noise.
3776800	3777300	Oh.
3778800	3779600	Hello, gentlemen.
3780480	3781520	You're reading?
3781520	3782080	Oh, yeah.
3783120	3783440	Yeah, yeah.
3783440	3784320	We found your book.
3790480	3792320	That survived the fire somehow.
3793920	3797760	That was for no one's eyes, but the forest's.
3802560	3803520	Were you a...
3803520	3803920	Wait.
3803920	3805360	Were you a dude?
3805440	3806800	Or were you a lady?
3806800	3809280	Always been a woman, but took on a male name
3809280	3812800	because she cursed her femininity because it didn't save her five.
3812800	3815120	I had a belt that turned me into a man.
3815120	3816560	I am currently a man.
3816560	3820320	I was a woman who watched my children die in a fire.
3820320	3821840	So a belt made you a dude?
3823280	3824160	It was like a strap on?
3824160	3825200	You're gonna question that.
3825440	3825920	Yes.
3834640	3836480	You fought a pig and...
3837120	3838160	Yes, I did, proudly.
3838160	3838720	With the new cylinders.
3839680	3841680	No, it was not a strap on.
3843440	3844560	And I don't know what that is.
3844560	3845600	It was a magical...
3845600	3847440	A strap on is a belt that has a dick on it.
3850160	3851280	Makes women feel like dudes.
3853680	3854180	Right.
3855920	3856720	I think that's cool.
3858320	3860000	If you're into that, you know?
3860000	3861520	What happens in the forest?
3866640	3868320	Where has it happened, Quark?
3869520	3870560	Where has it happened?
3870560	3872640	I'm sure you're describing this because you're very familiar.
3872640	3873840	I'm just trying to get to the point.
3873840	3876640	I think it's great that you're a lady that likes to strap on a dick
3876640	3877920	and fucking feel macho.
3877920	3880400	I think it's nothing to be ashamed of.
3881040	3883120	My children died in a fire!
3884000	3886160	Maybe if you hadn't been busy fucking asses and stuff.
3889920	3892160	If you've been a better mother, you're fucking acting like this.
3892160	3895760	I pull Sharpie aside for an aside.
3895760	3897520	Well, that happens.
3900960	3902640	I play my lute in the background.
3904400	3906080	Hey, you play decently.
3906080	3906720	I'm sorry.
3908480	3909840	I'm sorry about my friend.
3911440	3912000	It's fine.
3912320	3918000	I wish he was more honest with himself about what he would like.
3924240	3927040	Just to clarify, you read my journal entry.
3927040	3928640	I'm embarrassed that it was left behind.
3930640	3931520	This was your home?
3932320	3932880	Yes.
3932880	3935920	We're standing on the ashes of my children.
3935920	3942160	There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold.
3945920	3953520	And she's buying a spare ring to have on me.
3953520	3955840	Sorry guys, I'm playing my lute.
3955840	3959520	Do you know what happened here?
3959520	3964720	I know that there was a dark night.
3966000	3967840	I had just turned off the candles.
3967840	3972000	I had said goodnight to Toby, Melissa Fentz.
3972720	3974160	How do you turn a candle off?
3976240	3977520	I'm having an aside.
3978240	3979040	You blow it out.
3979040	3979600	You blow it out.
3979600	3980080	Okay.
3980080	3980640	You blow it out.
3981440	3986400	And she's buying a spare ring to have on me.
3986640	3989280	I'm sorry.
3989280	3989840	I'm sorry.
3989840	3993680	My friend is he and I take shits together.
3997120	3998640	That's not all they take together.
4004880	4005760	It's getting spicy.
4010240	4012400	I said goodnight to all of my children.
4013360	4014400	I fell asleep.
4014400	4015760	I awoke.
4015760	4016240	What were that?
4016240	4018160	You were going to name your children in order.
4018160	4019040	All five of them.
4019040	4021200	Yes, Toby.
4021200	4022400	Yeah, Melissa Fentz.
4022400	4023920	Okay, sugar.
4023920	4031840	Yeah, Danielle and Robert and Robert.
4036000	4040640	I turned off the candles and I felt a great heat.
4042160	4044400	I say turned off because I'm very casual with candles
4044480	4045520	because they don't know what switch is.
4048240	4054160	I felt a strong heat and I woke up to see my children.
4054160	4056640	All of their heads were on fire.
4056640	4057840	Their hair was on fire.
4060240	4061200	You should have turned them off.
4069920	4071360	He's so proud of himself.
4071360	4072240	So proud of himself.
4072800	4074880	Jeff Davis hates Radiolab.
4076240	4080240	I tried to turn them off.
4080240	4085520	I tried so hard to turn them off but they stayed on
4086560	4089840	and they stayed on all the way down.
4093280	4094800	I tried to turn myself on.
4094800	4098000	I tried to set myself on fire but then I wouldn't light.
4098880	4100080	I wouldn't light.
4100800	4102480	Perhaps there's some magic there.
4107280	4108720	Like the lady in Game of Thrones?
4108720	4109920	Like you can't be on fire?
4111200	4112480	Yes, precisely.
4112480	4119360	I may be part dragon but I would not set on fire and I left the house
4119360	4124800	and I knew that I would be a terrible mother to another child.
4124800	4129040	And I knew that an arrow would kill whatever was there.
4129040	4131040	So I devote.
4131040	4131760	Yes, what?
4131760	4132240	Exactly.
4133360	4134480	Yes, what?
4136160	4141760	Well, as you know, most enemies can be defeated by arrows.
4141760	4145520	So I took up the sport of arrowing.
4148720	4150640	That's the half elf word for it.
4152640	4154480	And I joined you.
4154480	4157120	So you don't know what did this to your peoples?
4159040	4163520	Um, I don't.
4163520	4164000	Okay.
4164000	4169120	I saw you two traveling and I hoped that I could latch on to you
4169120	4170160	and maybe you would help me.
4170880	4172560	Also, I've fallen in love with you during this.
4175680	4176560	And I, you?
4181120	4183120	I am so sorry about my gay friend.
4186240	4187440	I love him too.
4188400	4189120	Deeply.
4189120	4191120	I want a whole lot of love, yeah.
4193040	4194960	I want a whole lot of love, yeah.
4195600	4197200	And he loves Led Zeppelin.
4197200	4200800	Sharpie, Sharpie, let's join him.
4200800	4204160	Please don't tell him what I said about falling in love with you.
4204160	4209840	I would like to find a belt because I do still possess a sword between my legs.
4209840	4214400	And I'd like to revert to my previous self.
4215200	4215920	Adventure!
4217440	4222160	Hey, uh, sorry guys.
4222160	4224400	I was bored playing my lute.
4224400	4226880	Sharpie, explain to me really quickly what just happened.
4226880	4231840	Quark, we, we, we, we, we, really, honestly, nothing has changed.
4234720	4235520	I don't know what would happen.
4235520	4236240	Took a long time.
4236240	4238240	I was sitting over there playing my lute for a while.
4238240	4242480	Well, I think you should be less mean to, uh, uh, Mulbrane.
4242480	4242960	Okay.
4243680	4244160	All right.
4245920	4247200	She's a sensitive person.
4247840	4248160	Okay.
4249120	4253520	Uh, and, uh, this was her home and her children burnt to death.
4253520	4253760	Yeah.
4253760	4256160	And I was, I feel pretty bad about that.
4257360	4258160	Came down pretty hard.
4259760	4261520	Fucking turning candles off.
4263920	4269040	I'm a little overwhelmed, but like, I, I want to avenge the death of your children
4269040	4271040	and I want my dad to be safe.
4271040	4276000	I, I, I, I, I, I feel like the, the, the force that destroyed my children
4276000	4278880	is the same that is after your dad.
4278880	4279840	It's a good chance, right?
4279840	4280400	Probably.
4280400	4281680	By movie logic.
4281680	4282960	We're in the same area.
4282960	4285440	You don't see a lot of movies where it's like, oh, then an octopus did this,
4285440	4286720	but there's also a werewolf.
4288080	4289200	As cool as that would be.
4291280	4294000	Uh, it's probably Admiral Darkstar, I guess.
4294000	4295120	It's probably Spider-Man 3.
4295120	4298400	Oh,
4301920	4303600	what a, what a, what a SM3.
4303600	4305120	Timmy Parker in the audience.
4305120	4305600	All right.
4305600	4310400	Uh, well, I think we should proceed toward, uh, where the muscle on encampment.
4310400	4310560	Yeah.
4310560	4312480	Where my dad, that's what I said a long time ago.
4312480	4314080	You guys from where, right?
4314080	4315520	Spencer, we know how to head there.
4315520	4316560	Oh yeah, totally.
4316560	4316720	Yeah.
4316720	4318640	Well, we do that and end this segment.
4319520	4320240	It's over.
4320240	4320720	All right.
4321920	4322880	Spencer, everybody.
4322880	4323920	Dungeons and Dragons.
4325920	4327200	How do you like that, Austin?
4331520	4333600	I think that shit was advanced.
4336320	4337840	Eric McGathey is Mulrain.
4338560	4341600	Spencer and I will be selling merch in the air.
4341600	4342160	Yeah.
4342160	4346240	And really quick, uh, this city is the best city in the world.
4346240	4348320	That was so great.
4348320	4348800	Thank you.
4349600	4350320	Have to agree.
4350960	4351600	Have to agree.
4352480	4354240	Let's all get some queso after this.
4356080	4361360	I would call it the Paris of Texas, but there's some dipshit like Paris of Texas.
4361360	4361840	Isn't there?
4362800	4366080	Yeah, but it really is the Paris of Texas.
4366080	4370160	It's the San Francisco of the not the not Californians.
4370160	4373360	I don't know California and Texas.
4373360	4374480	We should, we should get along.
4374480	4376160	We should form an alliance.
4376160	4379440	Imagine if, imagine if we stood up to the whole country and said,
4380400	4382160	let us smoke weed and
4386080	4388560	don't mess with California either.
4388560	4388800	Right.
4390480	4393440	We'll find, we'll find a happy medium on toast size.
4393440	4393680	Yeah.
4395680	4399440	Because really it's doesn't need to be the, that's not, that's gotta be all your
4399440	4401120	people make a Nevada toast.
4401120	4405360	All your old chips, all of your movies, all of your television.
4405360	4408160	Like we could, we could, we could take, you know, who needs the rest of the,
4408160	4410880	who needs these fuckers that we're going to next.
4412960	4416240	I'll probably find a way to love them when we, when we hit Nashville.
4417280	4419280	But you guys have been amazing.
4420160	4420640	What do we do?
4421920	4423280	We're ready to find a conclusion.
4423280	4425920	You know, we can try and this is a, you might not like it, but
4426800	4430000	we have some music here created by Ryan Elder, who's our musical director.
4430000	4431440	And there's a country song.
4431440	4435200	Do you think maybe you could take what you've gleaned from, from this audience tonight?
4436000	4438080	Because you guys gave us a pretty easy ride.
4438080	4441200	You were working pretty hard last night in Phoenix, but this was a,
4441200	4443280	this was like being a nice comfy hammock.
4447040	4448400	And it's, it's not like.
4448400	4451280	But just not to say that the people in Phoenix made me work harder.
4451280	4452240	I learned.
4452240	4453440	You made yourself work harder.
4453440	4454800	I cut my teeth in Phoenix.
4454800	4455680	I punished myself.
4455680	4457680	But it's not like you've gone through a big, like, like,
4457680	4460880	heroic journey tonight where you found out like, like you had to,
4460880	4464560	you know, rise from ashes like a Phoenix and then come back up.
4464560	4465760	And, and learn something.
4465760	4467840	It was just nice and easy and fun all the way through.
4467840	4471120	It's, it's, you know, it doesn't make for a great heroic tale.
4471120	4473760	You know, maybe, how about this?
4473760	4477200	Maybe sing like a kind of maybe a little sad song or something like that.
4477200	4479040	Maybe country style about, about, you know,
4479040	4480800	about having to leave this, this beautiful town.
4480800	4481600	We can try it.
4481600	4481920	All right.
4481920	4483120	Let's, let's give it a whirl.
4483120	4483600	All right.
4483600	4487280	If not, we bring Jen Brown up and we sing the Pee-Pee-Poo-Pee song.
4488080	4490160	I would just say, yeah, who knows what we'll just,
4490160	4493600	we'll just dive into the audience and then run for the back door.
4493600	4495280	Yeah, Jen, Jen, stay loose.
4495840	4496400	Here we go.
4503040	4504160	The shuffleboard shuffle.
4510160	4515120	Well, I left my heart in Texas, but I left my foot in Maine.
4516640	4520880	I left my hand in Idaho and it was never quite the same.
4520880	4526800	Different parts of my body have been left in different states.
4528080	4532640	It all depends on where I was and what I chose to eat.
4533840	4538160	I had pancakes yesterday and took a poop with Jeff.
4539760	4544160	I'm up here dancing round and now I'm out of breath.
4544160	4547840	Two, three, four, hokey pokey in the back room
4547840	4552640	and a hickey-pickey on the high ho and a hokey pokey.
4552640	4556720	I don't know, hokey pokey on the ding dong.
4561280	4563360	I think that's, that's traditional, right?
4563360	4571120	That was, yeah, I don't think that was, that was some earnest tub shit going on.
4572400	4574000	I think I'm welcome back here any time.
4574480	4578480	Yeah, uh, uh, Dan is going to be at the broken spoke on Thursday.
4580720	4583200	Uh, you guys have been unreasonably fantastic.
4583200	4584720	I don't know what else we can possibly do.
4584720	4587280	I say we bring Jim Brack, uh, Jim Brown back up and we sing, uh,
4587280	4590240	maybe a couple of, a couple of, a little bit of rap and we finish.
4590240	4591520	Fuck some mamas!
4591520	4592800	Fuck some mamas, doesn't matter.
4592800	4593440	All right, all right, we got it.
4593440	4594240	What's your name, sir?
4595360	4596000	Mars?
4596000	4596640	Holy shit.
4598800	4600960	You want to fuck the God of War's mother right now?
4600960	4601520	Yeah, yeah.
4602240	4604960	I have a picture of him.
4604960	4605840	You have a picture of your mother?
4606880	4609920	Take the picture of your mother out and Dan's going to cut a hole in it and fuck it.
4612320	4614080	He actually, not, he's seriously a man.
4614080	4615040	Where is he going?
4615040	4618400	A man dressed like the world's sexiest valet parker.
4622800	4623280	Mars.
4624560	4629040	As requested that Dan not only sing a rap about fucking his mother.
4629040	4630000	He's searching through his.
4630880	4633520	He's satchel for a photo of his mother.
4634160	4636400	This is the weirdest fetish I've ever come across.
4637600	4638960	All right, so fuck my mother.
4638960	4640000	Oh yeah, fuck my mother.
4640000	4642240	Literally, literally, she's home.
4642240	4643360	The door's open.
4643360	4645760	We got to introduce him to deluxe in Phoenix.
4645760	4647440	Yeah, but you find it?
4647440	4648240	No.
4648240	4648880	You didn't bring it?
4651520	4652640	Find that photo, man.
4652640	4654800	Wait, did you bring a photo of your mother so that Dan would fuck it,
4654800	4658000	or that you used to carry a photo of your beloved mother
4658000	4659200	that you like to have strangers?
4659520	4661360	In lieu of your mom's photo, do you think you could,
4661360	4662480	could you help me out up here?
4662480	4666160	Do you want to, do you want to like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4666160	4667440	Let's get Mars up on stage.
4668320	4669840	We got to, we got to close the show.
4669840	4671520	It's don't, don't pressure out.
4671520	4676000	Don't be like me, but we also need, we need, we need to get up here for the hook.
4676000	4677520	We need her to do the refrain.
4677520	4679040	All right, okay.
4680640	4682960	Yeah, yeah.
4684400	4686000	We remember the refrain, how it goes.
4686960	4689200	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4689200	4690720	I'm sorry about some rapping, man.
4690720	4694160	Yo, it's been a, oh, yeah, no, no, I'm sorry too.
4694160	4695120	I'm sorry, I'm sorry too.
4696160	4697680	How lucky she brought her Chablis up here.
4697680	4698240	I'm sorry, man.
4702240	4703920	Yo, it's been a good night.
4703920	4704880	I'm flowing rap.
4706000	4707760	I hope I don't do it.
4707760	4708640	Mouse trap.
4708640	4710800	I'm just rhyming words.
4710800	4714560	Have I got shit flying out my mouth like projectile turns?
4714560	4716960	I'm going to throw it out to outer space.
4716960	4721040	I hope everyone in Austin likes me regardless of my race.
4722160	4726480	Because I'm white, I don't want to do anything bad tonight.
4726480	4732320	We've had such a good time with these folks, but every egg has a white and a little yolk.
4733360	4734720	I don't know what I mean.
4734720	4736560	What the fuck are you peeing?
4736560	4738320	I'm sucking a teen a bean.
4739360	4740800	Just let me rap some more.
4740800	4743920	I'm coming around to another door.
4743920	4745280	Going to open it wide.
4745280	4748080	Come on down to haunted town.
4748080	4751040	Turn that frown upside down.
4751040	4754000	Here's your little pooping frown.
4754000	4755200	Come on down, Mars.
4755200	4755840	Take it, Mars.
4755840	4756320	Mars.
4757280	4758400	Yeah, Mars.
4758400	4759680	Yeah, God of War.
4760560	4762080	He parked my car outside earlier.
4764240	4765840	Yeah, go Mars.
4765840	4766320	Feel it.
4766560	4767760	Yo, yo, yo, go.
4768640	4770800	Holy shit, I'm standing next to Dan Harmon.
4771520	4774000	He wrote Community, and that show's fucking charming.
4774640	4777520	I'm on the mic, and I'm standing on the stage.
4777520	4780000	I'm in my life, and I'm writing a fucking new page.
4780960	4785360	I saw the D&D live with Spencer, and it was fucking awesome shit.
4787040	4790000	Come on down to haunted town.
4790000	4793040	Turn that frown upside down.
4793040	4796000	Here's your little pooping frown.
4796000	4799040	Come on down to haunted town.
4799040	4801600	Come on down to haunted town.
4801600	4805040	Yo, I'll step down outside out.
4805040	4808000	He is yellow, poop is brown.
4808000	4811040	Come on down to haunted town.
4811040	4814160	Come on down to haunted town.
4814160	4817120	He is yellow, poop is brown.
4817120	4820160	Turn that frown upside down.
4820160	4822560	Come on down to haunted town.
4822560	4824240	What's your name, Stefan?
4824320	4825360	How do you know when you're finished?
4826480	4827120	What's your name?
4827760	4828720	My condolences.
4829600	4830240	What's your name?
4831200	4834320	Where'd you get that sweater from a sweater sale?
4834880	4835440	What's your name?
4836400	4838240	Yeah, how do you know when you're finished?
4839760	4840320	What's your name?
4840320	4841200	Upside down.
4841200	4842160	Yeah, no it's not.
4842160	4845120	He is yellow, poop is brown.
4845120	4845680	What's your name?
4845680	4846720	Down to haunted town.
4846720	4847200	Fuck you.
4851200	4854000	Yo, yo, I worked a crowd tonight.
4854800	4856320	Take you somewhere else in Texas.
4856320	4857120	We love you.
4857120	4857440	Yeah.
4858560	4863920	One more time for Aaron McGathey, Spencer Crippen, Mars.
4863920	4869280	Mars, Jen Brown, Led Zeppelin guy, Tito Vodka.
4869280	4870320	Fuck you, Kettle One.
4871360	4872640	Fuck you, Kettle One.
4874400	4874960	We love you.
4876720	4877600	You guys are amazing.
4879600	4880960	Let's go have a drink together.
4880960	4892640	And, yeah, let's all go to the fire and get drunk.
4904240	4906640	Hey, Mars, here's a book.
4910960	4920640	Good night.
