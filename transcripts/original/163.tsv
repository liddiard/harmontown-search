0	20680	There is a ghost who lives in Harman Town, who lives in Harman Town, who lives in Harman
50680	61200	Town, the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're too
61200	70520	kind. What does that mean? Well, it's humility. You're too kind. What am I, George Carlin?
70520	75440	Deconstructing the first, what am I, what am I, Andy Kindler? What am I, what am I,
75440	82840	that's an Andy Kindler joke. We've got to have Andy back on. I'm very excited tonight. We have
82840	87480	a bestselling author. He's written a landmark book. Like it's the, I don't know, I don't know
87480	92080	what you'd call it. It kind of bridges, I mean, for those of you, for those few of you in the
92080	99960	Harman Town demographic who may be somewhere on the spectrum, those rare couple of you, you might
99960	107840	be aware of a sort of odd kind of tension that exists between the actually autistic, which is a
107840	117280	hashtag that is used, you know, actually autistic and, and the, and the, like really, really beleaguered,
117280	125160	frantic, sometimes heroic, sometimes unintentionally villainous parents of, of autistic
125160	133840	children who, you know, they, they, they, it's, it's one of the most ironically divided like realms I
133840	139400	find, ever since I've been writing the character of Abbott and community, I've sort of been drawn
139400	145640	into this world and fascinated by it. And this guy wrote this book that sort of like, it makes a,
145640	150360	it makes holding hands across that schism somehow possible. It's a, it's a really good book. If
150360	156920	you've ever had questions about autism, what the hell it is, which we all do, because in the seventies,
156920	162520	we were cattle prodding children still, like to, like, Oh, well, we can talk about that. They were
162520	169040	called tingle sticks. It was, and it was, it was like, it was one of the most popular, it was,
169040	175320	it was the guy that, that had vented that treatment method was a hero to, to, to some of the most
175320	180120	loving parents in the world, because he represented a light at the end of a tunnel, you know, and it
180360	186600	was zapping, zapping kids for not hugging you. And then lo and behold, after a while, they start
186600	191560	hugging you. It was looked at, we did it, we cured autism. How much voltage was coming out of the
191560	198760	tingle stick? It was tingly. It was a modified cattle prod, I assume they, I don't know how you
198760	206280	calibrate it with an autistic child, because that's a mistake, right? Yeah. You can't calibrate it
206280	210440	with an autistic kid. You're going to like the zap them and go, what do you think? And he's going
210440	221160	to be like, lemons. All right. Maybe up the bull. Turn it up. That sounds like, that sounds like a
221160	228280	joke making light of autism, but I obviously I'm, I'm, I care. Obviously, obviously, obviously.
228280	235880	Obviously. Isn't that obvious, people? I mean, I read the whole fucking audio book.
237800	242440	It's like 12 hours long. Wait, you finished it? I did by listening to it at double speed.
242440	247400	Nice. So when I, I told the guy, when I met him, I said, I thought you sounded like Martin Scorsese.
250120	254360	Well, so you can read it. You can hear it double speed and it still scans. Like you can still dig
254520	262520	it. Yeah. Maybe I'm autistic. Yeah, no, it's, you can, yeah, I could, I've tried this with other
262520	266280	books. Like I didn't, I tried this with the Scientology book and I did, I found myself
266280	269880	having to slow it down, but I don't know if it's just the language of his writing. He's a great
269880	274440	journalist. I'd love to talk to him about that too. I spent so much time researching his, like
274440	278120	reading his book that I didn't research his career, which is probably kind of awesome too. He's just a
278120	283800	great journalist. And, but here's, here's what the book sounds like a double speed context of a
283800	286840	conference and the experience proves to be a revelation in ways that they couldn't get through.
286840	289720	And from the outside, not all that much happened. They blew up cups of tea that would still be
289720	292200	sitting there hours later, cold on the floor because they suddenly forgot what to do with
292200	297880	tea. It's Scorsese, right? My influences in The Departed are largely Hitchcockian,
297880	301560	but people don't know that. Think about Hitchcock is he loved revelation. He loved revelation.
302200	310840	Uh, but, uh, anyways, I, I, I, I, I, I, well, whatever. I, I'm, I'm in a great mood. My wife
310840	318440	is coming home tonight. She missed her flight yesterday. I'm a little concerned, but like,
318440	325240	like I've been seeing the picture. She's she's, she has lost a stone, not a kidney stone. She's
325240	331080	lost, she's lost 14 pounds or more. Um, which apparently the Irish still use stones to weigh
331080	337880	stuff, which doesn't seem scientific because they come in at all. I mean, which, which stone
339560	347640	could be a heavy one? Did they round up or down to the, to the nearest stone? I don't, I don't,
347640	351880	I don't even know if, if what you're doing is a joke. I'm not asking your honest question. Well,
351880	357080	I don't know what a stone is. A stone, he weighs seven stone. What is a stone is a,
357080	363080	metrically, what is a stone? What? 20 pounds. All right. So yeah. So you weigh seven. So she,
363080	368600	what do you do weigh 125? She lost the stone and I think I may have found it while she was gone.
368600	373960	Like I have, it was inside a donut. And I like, I took a bath tonight and I was like, scrub,
373960	378760	a scrub, scrub. Like, like, cause I really, I literally, all right. Like I'm accustomed to
378760	383320	the fact that this will elicit a reaction, but in honor of our, of the book we'll be discussing
383320	391160	tonight, I say this, I don't care. I haven't taken a shower since she left. Yeah. Oh my god, whistles.
392200	399240	That's, that's people are shocked when they hear how little I am capable of showering. Um, I don't,
399240	404920	yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like I, I never thought about it. I never did it. You know,
404920	411240	maybe my chiropractor was probably like, it's like, it's like a pin cushion full of stink pins.
413320	421480	Um, I know, I know my chiropractor has, has OCD and, and like, I know I must be, I must
421480	426280	constantly challenge his career path. Like I must, every time I leave his office, he must be like,
426280	432520	why, why, why, why do I have to care about the human back so much that this man is in my life?
433080	437320	Because I like, every time I, every time I come into the office, I have to, because you go,
437320	442200	you face a table and then it goes, you go down, but I have to empty my pockets and in my, my pockets
442200	451080	are always just like, there's just like, you know, random drugs and like beer bottle caps and like
451080	458520	house keys and just like wads of money. And he always like, he always, the look on his face is
458520	465000	like, I might as well be the baby rats. And he always goes like, he goes like, you have a little
465000	470920	bit of lint on your shirt. And I'm like, I'm like, if he's, if he's noticing lint on my shirt,
471560	479960	he wants to hang himself because here's some other stuff on my shirt. Uh, five weeks of residue,
480600	490280	you know, blood stains from my back acne. Yeah, I'm not compatible with it. And he was like, boy,
490280	494200	if my mom saw that, like, like one time he said about like all my stuff, like he's like, he's like,
494200	500040	you gotta get a money clip, get a money clip. Like you keep telling me that, but 42, I think,
500040	505240	I think, I think, I think, I think everything's kind of baked up here. Like I, I got my phone
505240	512200	and I got my, my pocket that has all of my money, my wads of money. And I also feel like I probably
512200	518840	lose like $600 a week that's, which is fair to me. It feels like karmic, like, like, like, like,
518920	524040	because do you give the pan handlers or an encourage pan handling or as Spencer does,
524040	529400	do you pull over when you see a guy recycling cans and like throw money at him that he didn't ask for
529400	535720	it to encourage industriousness? Are we, BF Skinner is our job to program the homeless, uh,
535720	541160	with our money. The, the actual solution is just ooze so much cash that you randomly just,
542280	546120	you just, it just comes out of you. Like actual, actual trickle down. Yeah. Yeah.
546360	552280	Yes. If Reagan was alive today, he would, he would be like, this is what I meant.
555320	563080	Star Wars initiative. Uh, that's okay. That was the idea of like the, the, the, the, the,
563080	568520	the Star Wars space station was trickle down, uh, uh, justice, right? Like we're going to trickle
568520	575000	everything down. Um, so Aaron's coming back. She may actually walk in during the show. She landed
575000	581000	at seven 30. I got a text. It may, it may have been, no. Did you, did you do a little arts
581000	589480	and crafts project at home? I did. I did. I, I, I, I, I, uh, yeah, I cut out, uh, welcome home
589480	599320	out of letters and hug them from a string. Yeah. Bare minimum. Right. But I really wanted to be
599320	604120	there when, when the dogs are. Cause if I feel like they're, yeah, that would be, that would be
604120	611320	YouTubable. That's what's important. I'm a little, I'm a little, I'm a little nervous about like, I,
611320	616600	like, I don't know, you know, did you speak every day or talk or text? No, because I'm not good on
616600	621160	the phone or, and FaceTime's weird. Like she gets punished for calling me or FaceTiming me because
621160	625400	I'm like, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to be with Aaron. I wouldn't be married to Aaron if, if,
625400	630600	if text messaging wasn't invented, you know, if I, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be anything.
630600	635400	I don't think if I didn't come up with a technology that allowed me to like, you know, like, I don't,
635400	638840	I just, cause someone calls you on the phone, especially FaceTime is especially like,
639480	645000	it's just the worst, like, like, like, isn't it the worst of all possible worlds? Because it's like,
645000	650120	it's like, like you can't, you, in a normal face to face conversation, you have the option of
650680	656360	minimized eye contact. Like you can't do that with FaceTime. You can't like look at a George Jetson
656360	663880	screen and then just look like away. You have to like lock eyes with a, with a deck of card sized
663880	669960	version of your wife and like stare at her. And then, and then be like, like, yeah, and then what
669960	680120	did you do? And I drank some water. It's not my wife. This is an image of my wife. Okay. And then
680120	685000	inevitably the other person on the other end goes like, all right. Like, which, which, which means
685960	691880	you don't love me. And I was like, like, like, what, what? And they're like, what? And I'm like,
691880	700040	do you mean I don't love you? Like, what? It's bad. FaceTime is bad for me. So no. And that's all I
700040	707720	get. I don't know. But then on the other hand, like my cat, Fiv, like she's sick. And like, so then
707880	714280	like, like, like a, like a, like an, you know, like a emotionally like kind of stunted person,
715000	719400	like the reason we like animals is because they make a convenient like trough to like,
719400	724360	because they can't, you know, you just, so of course I'm like bawling about the cat and like
724360	728440	punched a wall, which I haven't done in 20 years. There's a big hole in the bedroom wall. And I was
728440	735800	like, like rolling around on the bed going, I recorded myself crying because halfway through
735800	743320	it, I was like, this sounds fake. Well, you, you could separate those two parts of your brain that
743320	748440	in that well. And God, like you're going through such a weird cry. Yeah. No, because it was weird
748440	754200	because I haven't done this in 10 years. I don't even remember crying like this. Let's see. It's
754200	760680	gonna sound like Scorsese. Is this? Wait, there's nothing I need to do, right? I'll just come out of
760680	770600	the speaker, grandpa. See, I don't know what's going on. The suspense is palpable.
773880	779960	I don't hear anything. I must have done. Is this a voice memo or? Did it do it wrong?
790680	797960	Oh,
808280	811960	you have a basset hound?
820680	827960	Oh,
836200	838280	that's the cry of somebody that doesn't cry enough.
840360	843960	That's why I recorded it. I'm like, this is because I wanted to talk to my therapist about,
843960	847960	I'm like, okay, this is fucked up. Like my wife, my wife's been gone for a month.
848360	853640	When she calls me on the phone, she walks away from it feeling unloved. I, the fucking cat that
853640	859080	I've totally neglected. That's why it's dying because I don't. That was incredibly ill when
859080	863400	you found it. Like it was already, it was, it was FIV positive, but, but I'm saying like,
863400	871160	once we got the dogs, it was like, you need to take that feline shit to the curb. Girl friend.
871160	874360	I don't know why I paused before friend. I was trying to think of maybe girl Fiv.
874360	879800	Like that's her name. She's been, she's been neglected since the dogs arrived. Like I have
879800	885080	not, like she's, she's been chased away by the dogs. You know, like she's, she's like repelled
885080	889800	by the dogs, particularly Harvey. And like, I can tell because when I come over, she comes right at
889800	893560	me when the dogs are upstairs with you and I'm downstairs, she comes at me and just like, she's
893560	899320	like, I need, I need a friend really bad right now. She's so bony and scrawny. She spends a long,
899320	903080	a lot of time outside the front door where the dogs can't get at her. And then like every time
903720	906920	it's like, it's a bummer. And it's like, but I just want to be honest about that. Like,
906920	910840	I don't want it like, like, it's like, because the important thing about that is like, okay,
910840	916120	this is not, let's not celebrate this as a man's bond between him and his cat. Let's look at this
916120	922520	as symptomatic of misappropriated emotional funds, you know, like, and, and, and I, you know,
922520	926520	I shared that with my therapist and I, but I had a really good session based on that. And she said,
926520	932200	you know, it's time, it's time for the chapter called Dan doesn't have feelings to come to an
932200	940920	end. And I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I know how to breathe. And I'll learn
940920	951160	how to, I'll learn how to talk to Aaron about, about how much I love her and, and kind of spread
951160	960680	that peanut butter of feeling across the bread of life. Speaking of which, Happy Rosh Hashanah.
962440	968760	I think that's what Rosh Hashanah means. The bread of life, right? Yeah. Like, yeah.
970600	973240	There's no greater tragedy than, than the life unleavened.
977240	980040	I think famous Jewish cooking, cooking host,
980040	992680	Emeril Berg, what's said. All right, well, let's, let's, let's talk to our guest about some autism.
993720	1000680	His book is called Neurotribes. It's, it's truly, it's the first determined and thorough and
1000680	1007000	enlightening journalistic investigation of a phenomenon that is still a mystery to everybody.
1007880	1013160	It's a New York Times bestseller. He has flattered us by coming out from San Francisco. His name is
1013160	1033080	Steve Silberman. There's a microphone. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi, nice to be here. Good.
1033080	1039400	Nice to be here. Are you, are you, are you, are you going to sit down? He's settling in. All right.
1039400	1046840	Is that better? No. But I, sorry that, sorry that was off-putting. No, no, no. It's fine.
1046840	1052840	There are no rules here except the ones you make. And I'm strangely adamant about them.
1055240	1059480	Now I feel like I have to say you don't have to sit down. I mean, Steve, what you don't know is,
1059560	1062920	Dan, when a guest comes out, he takes the opportunity to sit down himself,
1062920	1068120	but he doesn't want to be robbed of that repose. That's great. Right. Well, I was, I guess I was
1068120	1071960	kind of scared or delayed that you were going to launch into like just 10 minutes about airline
1071960	1075160	food or something. Cause you were just standing there with the mic and it was like, it's, he's
1075160	1080600	going to, he's going to do standup. High chairs slightly scare me. Yeah. Yeah. You know, one
1080600	1085640	wonders if I'm going to teeter off or something. I wish we could that, that's a good segue into
1085640	1091160	our talk about autism, which because, because the, the big, the big theme in the book is the,
1091160	1097560	is the realization, which is ironically realized long after Hans Asperger said it originally,
1098600	1106600	his, his, his feelings on the subject lost to the ages until recently that, that this is, you know,
1106600	1111000	it's less about diagnosis and treatment than it is about realizing that there's,
1111000	1113960	there's different kinds of brains and there's a lot of ways we can,
1113960	1118200	we can make the environment compatible to anybody that we happen to run across.
1118200	1124200	That's true. Basically in 1930s, Vienna, he started seeing these kids in his clinic
1124200	1130040	who were interestingly mischievous. They would steal a bunch of shit to build up their chemistry
1130040	1134360	sets. They would get kicked out of schools because they didn't take the teachers seriously.
1134360	1140440	It was sort of a clinic of last resort. One kid was, there's a typical thing with,
1140440	1147960	especially with mildly autistic people, is obsession with particular areas. And one kid
1147960	1152200	was obsessed with poison and was there because he had stolen cyanide from his school. Yeah,
1152200	1157720	exactly. There were red flags. Exactly, exactly. And some of the kids ended up there like through
1157720	1162280	the court system and stuff. And the thing about this clinic was that it was amazingly progressive
1162280	1167480	place because it was like half clinic, half school, like kids wouldn't just bring their,
1167480	1172360	or kids wouldn't just get brought there for a diagnosis or whatever. The people who worked
1172360	1176760	in the clinic actually lived with the kids and observed them like tying their shoes in the
1176760	1183240	morning if they could or couldn't. And that's how they learned to recognize autism. And Asperger
1183240	1188920	and his colleagues believe that autism and autistic traits were very common. And in fact,
1189480	1193880	that people with autistic traits had been accelerating the evolution of science,
1193880	1200760	technology, and culture from millennia. And we're already familiar to all of us through the sort
1200760	1206200	of pop culture archetypes of the absent-minded professor. Right. Dr. Who. Right. Well,
1206200	1211000	that wasn't invented yet, but autistic people would soon make sure that it was.
1213400	1216520	Isn't that a character? But I mean, before the word Asperger's, which by the way,
1216520	1221480	it should be noted Asperger did not. He didn't discover Asperger syndrome. No,
1221560	1226440	he discovered what we now call the autism spectrum. And was saying in the beginning,
1226440	1230280	which, yeah, this is a spectrum and this is like, yeah. And, and it was later,
1230280	1234600	what was it the seventies when somebody coined the phrase Asperger's syndrome? Yeah. And that
1234600	1240440	was a marketing term actually, because it was a, it was an autism diagnosis that did not contain
1240440	1245800	the word autism. And the reason, one of the reasons why it proved to be so popular was that
1245800	1251080	it did not carry the heavy burden of shame and stigma that the word autism carried because
1251080	1257000	parents had been blamed for autism, not by Asperger. Right. One might note by Leo Connor,
1257000	1263720	Connor, that the, the Edison to Asperger's Tesla in the, there you go, in the discovery of autism
1263720	1268280	is a parallel. I kept thinking about cause what an appropriate parallel. Yeah. Because Edison was
1268280	1273080	the more successful one. He was the more neurotypical one. And he was the, he was better at
1273080	1279160	issuing press releases. And he was, he was American. And I mean, he had two advantages
1279160	1284360	over Asperger. He was even though he actually was from Eastern Europe too. He lived in America.
1284360	1291080	He worked at Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, but even better from the perspective of history,
1291080	1296680	he didn't work for Nazis like Hans Asperger did because Hans Asperger is one of whole clinic in
1296680	1301560	the university Vienna hospital. Well, it happened to be in a country that the Nazis marched into
1301560	1309480	in 1938 to annex for the German fatherland. And so at that point, Asperger's position in his
1309480	1315960	culture became very, very tricky because the Germans inspired by the way, by American eugenic
1315960	1322840	scientists were attempting to basically flush people with hereditary diseases and disorders
1322840	1326920	out of the gene pool. And this is one of the craziest things about this book because it's
1326920	1332120	completely unexpected. There's probably whole entire books written about this stuff, but they're
1332120	1338760	probably, they probably tend towards conspiracy dramas and things like this. But the cold hard
1338760	1343880	facts are that, are that the things that Hitler's reading while he's in jail, before he writes
1343880	1350440	Mein Kampf are coming from our side of the Atlantic. We were becoming obsessed with eugenics.
1351640	1356520	And unashamed of them because they didn't have the current stigma because there weren't no
1356520	1365320	Hitler yet. You describe a conference where it's like the world's fair of eugenics. Yeah,
1365320	1370680	exactly. And by the way, there was a slogan in use at that conference, which was echoed in Orphan
1370680	1376200	Black recently, the self direction of human evolution, that creepy leaky guy. That was
1376200	1383160	actually a real slogan from the American eugenics movement. And they had like the ideal paragon of
1383160	1387960	civilization was this white athlete from Harvard. Like they had statues. Oh, they had, they had
1387960	1394760	composites made of, of the perfect man, which were based on the 10 handsomest guys from Harvard or
1394760	1402280	something. Really. And it was, you know, and there were, there were some of the speeches on the,
1402280	1407320	you know, some of the panels being done there included titles like the Jewish problem. Right.
1407320	1412280	Exactly. And it was the Negro problem and the Negro, and like all kinds of stuff about Negroes
1412280	1417000	and what are they and what do they want? Why are they hanging around all of a sudden?
1418440	1423720	The, the, it was, it was bone chilling. I was completely unexpected because hearing him
1423720	1428360	tucking into a book about, about Temple Grandin, but I'm seeing like this crazy,
1428360	1432760	like Alan Moore, like it feels like an alternate history where there should be zeppelins in the
1432760	1437240	sky. Well, that was the thing, man. It's like, you know, there have been a million books written
1437240	1443080	about Asperger syndrome or autism or whatever, but they've usually looked at autism through a
1443080	1448440	strictly medical lens. And there's actually been very, very little written about Asperger in his
1448440	1454200	clinic. And I thought like, why hasn't anyone ever pulled the camera back to see like the burning
1454200	1462360	Jewish storefronts and, you know, euthanasia going on? Well, that's the irony is, is that what the,
1462360	1468040	you know, history is written by the winners. And the myth that favors us is that here it was,
1468040	1472760	it was the 1920s and late ladies loved short hair and sitting on flagpoles.
1473800	1482200	FDR had a plan for the kaleidoscope. And meanwhile in Europe, a growing menace. Adolf Hitler
1482200	1488520	invents antisemitism and slowly somehow manages to convince half the planet that it's a great idea.
1489160	1496920	And we sort of, you know, but the absolute ugly truth of it is that there is an uplifting
1498600	1504040	aspect to it, an uplifting irony to the fact that we were flirting with it in open air,
1504760	1510360	inviting Jewish physicians to a conference to hear talk about the Jewish problem. They weren't
1510360	1514520	banned from the thing. It was like, let's just be antisemitic just because it's fashionable.
1514520	1519880	You can't do anything about it. Dr. Rosen lately. Do you want to be a doctor or not? Sure. It
1519880	1524200	couldn't hurt. And it's like, well, why do you talk like that? That's the title of my next
1524200	1538840	conference. What kind of, why are you so Jewy? Fair enough. The shadow that we cast by being
1538840	1547240	allowed to talk about it by publishing books about it, by the triple irony of the euphemism
1547240	1557800	of the word eugenics. Which means the good birth. Right. The fact that it took what happened then
1557800	1564840	for everyone to be shamed into a proper historical perspective is it's simultaneously totally
1564840	1574840	cynical, but also kind of like, well, good. That's what you get. Language is thought and
1576200	1583480	thought is deed. And you can't just walk around seething with hatred and be polite about it.
1584440	1592440	That is going to end up being the same as actual bad physical things happening. Right. And also,
1592440	1596840	at some point, the Nazis must have been like, why are the Americans objecting to this? We are
1596840	1601080	just putting their theories into practice. They must have absolutely like, like, like Vonnegut
1601080	1605480	used to muse, like they must have thought for a while, like they could flip a coin, like which
1605480	1609560	side's America going to come in on? Because we were certainly making money from both sides of
1609560	1613880	selling oil and bullets and things, you know, like before we got into the war, it was like,
1614520	1619400	you know, so yeah, I'm sure there were rooms in the Nazi headquarters where they were like,
1619480	1622520	you know what? There's still a good 40% chance when they finally come in.
1622520	1623160	Right.
1623160	1627960	Guys, Pearl Harbor. Ah, fuck. Right. They're not going to be able to spin that one.
1629000	1636360	I guess they're, are we still, yeah, access of evil. Why did we do that? What have we gotten?
1636360	1645960	Free sushi. It's bad by the time it gets here. It's 1939. Free sushi is a good way to die.
1646840	1653800	Um, uh, anyways, so, but, but that, that, that's like, that's a huge, uh, a huge weird side note,
1653800	1659800	but a major, but you had to do it. You had to, you had to re shine like long lost light
1659800	1667880	on that fact because Asperger, uh, um, that it seems to be one of the big answers to the question.
1667880	1673400	Why was this also complicated and arduous? Why is something that's being discovered way back then
1673400	1678200	still in the seventies being treated with cattle prods? And part of the answer is because Asperger
1678200	1683240	is just like bound to, you know, there's pictures of him and there's swastikas somewhere in the
1683240	1689800	picture. But the story is worthy of a, you know, uh, Robert De Niro movie or something. Like,
1689800	1693080	I mean, the guy was a hero. He didn't, he didn't like no Nazis.
1693080	1697720	Well, he was a complex hero. I mean, we have no idea, you know, he probably had to make some
1697720	1702360	concessions that we don't know about to not have his head chopped off basically.
1702360	1705240	You don't, you don't, you know, you don't mention any of those in your book, but I mean,
1705240	1711560	you paint a picture of a guy who by virtue of his love of these children is absolutely horrified
1711560	1716920	by the idea. And he's sort of some of the ironic concessions. Dan, could you use the word ironic
1716920	1723560	more tonight? Um, so, so one of the, one of the, one of the stranger and more poetic concessions
1723560	1729480	that he makes that you're talking about is that he, he tries to, he tries to make a case for these
1729480	1733400	kids continuing to get treatment because they'll make a good code breakers one day. Yeah, exactly.
1733400	1740280	And if you think about it with Alan Turing, we, in a sense, we use the Aspergian brain to break,
1741240	1746120	the German codes, but they were too busy killing the children that carried those genes
1746120	1751560	to, to make use of those talents. The children that invented as they, as they entered adulthood,
1751560	1755880	if they were time and time again, what we're seeing is like, you know, it's, we, we, we,
1755880	1759320	on one hand, we have to issue the myth. I don't think anyone suffers from this myth anymore.
1759320	1764040	The idea that every single person with autism has some kind of hidden superpower, like an X-Man,
1764040	1771080	but the, but it is true time and time again, that through, through environmental understanding,
1771080	1777800	doing the equivalent of a ramp for someone as bound to a chair, um, uh, which, but in, in,
1777800	1783560	in this case involves sort of opening your own mind, changing your own time scale, um, uh,
1783560	1789080	that, that those, the, the people that suffer from childhood autism that are raised in that patient
1789160	1794520	of an environment, which is no easy thing in a capitalist world. Um, though they, they do
1794520	1800200	flourish. They do learn how to communicate in their own time. And to the extent that there is
1800200	1804520	disparity between the way they communicate the thoughts in their heads and mainstream society,
1804520	1810440	they, they have always been the, the, it's, it's not an exaggeration to say that they are
1810440	1816120	progressing our society. Right. And one reason why we didn't know how cool autistic people could be
1816680	1821160	for a couple of decades was that they were put in institutions because the guy who took
1821160	1826680	credit for discovering autism, who was not Hans Asperger, but this guy, Leo Connor, uh, said that
1827240	1833320	even the special talents of his kids, like this kid could recognize 18 symphonies before he turned
1833320	1838600	two. He could correctly identify 18 symphonies, but Connor, instead of saying, Oh, this is really
1838600	1844040	cool. This is a specialized form of intelligence, which is what Asperger said. He called it autistic
1844040	1849080	intelligence, but Connor said, Oh, no, no, these kids are just unloved. Their parents are
1849080	1854840	refrigerator mothers and over ambitious fathers. So the treatment is to remove the child and put
1854840	1859960	them in an institution and have their family pictures taken out of the family albums quietly
1859960	1865240	and never mentioned again. Yeah. One of the most chilling things is like pre, pre, before the rise
1865240	1869640	of the, you know, between world war one and world war two, there's a German doctor who sends out a
1869640	1874440	questionnaire. So, so we're still in a time when if you're born with what we now call autism,
1874440	1879400	you're called feeble minded. Um, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're shuttled into, uh, into,
1879400	1883800	into an institutional world and you're a ward of the state and you're a burden on the parents
1883800	1888920	emotionally and financially. And this doctor sends out this questionnaire that says to the
1888920	1897240	men of the household, uh, specifically, uh, and, and, and says, uh, um, how would you feel about an,
1897240	1902200	an artificial shortening of your child's life to the extent that they're unable to, uh, live
1902200	1909000	with their disability asking these sort of leading questions about euthanasia. And not only was the
1909000	1916760	response overwhelmingly, Oh, absolutely. But with an extra order of macabre fries, that is, I wish,
1916760	1921720	I wish, however, that you just wouldn't ask. Right. Exactly. I wish, don't tell me, I wish
1921720	1925960	you'd just kill the kid and tell me it was natural causes. That would be, if you're,
1925960	1932280	if you're looking for what I would like to order from this menu. Um, and, and we have to, you know,
1933560	1938040	it's dark shit. We don't have to sympathize, but we have to, we have to, we have to, we have to
1938040	1943000	remember, I don't know, we have to, what the fuck do we have to remember? It's hard. It's, it's,
1943000	1947880	it's, it's, it's, the world was ignorant and it was, the poor people were, were, were, were held
1947880	1953000	responsible for their, their kids' disabilities. And they were like, they were, they were, they
1953000	1957400	were, were never a ticket to increase social standing. You know, I have an autistic kid,
1957400	1962360	didn't mean, uh, Oh, maybe I should get a promotion at work. And also, and also at some point, uh,
1962360	1967320	they were being bombarded by propaganda that such children were a burden on the state. And
1967320	1971960	they would literally have pictures of these sort of drooling maniacs from asylums and say, you know,
1971960	1978040	50 million Reich marks a year, et cetera. And so they started doing it like fairly publicly too,
1978040	1981720	like they didn't really hide it. And they realized that was such bad PR, like nobody's going to really
1981720	1986200	sign off on that. Like even the hardest, you know, like, like Nazi, like, you know, like
1986200	1990040	household is not going to really sign off on the killing of German children, you know, even if they
1990040	1993880	are mentally disabled or whatever. And so then they just put it way on the, on the, you know,
1993880	1998600	on the secrets. Well, right. And in fact, I mean, something that I talk about in the book
1998600	2005160	is that, uh, the Germans really used the killing of disabled children and adults as a practice run
2005160	2010040	for killing the Jews. That's how they figured out how to do, Oh, we can put the trains here and
2010040	2013960	move the bodies here. And the first one, the gas van, the thing that they would do when they
2013960	2018680	put a pipe through the exhaust pipe of a van, that way that was for euthanasia. Right. Right.
2018680	2022440	They had different techniques. They would, they would, they would slowly feed them less. That's,
2022440	2030200	that's the specialist diet. Yes. And, uh, and you know, word got out, even though it was supposed
2030200	2035400	to be a secret project. So like old people would say, when the feeble minded are gone,
2035400	2039720	we will be the next to go. And you know, children would run away from these buses,
2039720	2042840	even though they weren't supposed to know what they were for. Right. When they liberated,
2042840	2046440	I don't know if it was the Russians or the Americans when we were, we were closing in
2046440	2051800	on Berlin at the end of the war and they liberated one of the camps and, uh, they found loads of
2051800	2057400	twins, almost all the survivors were these twin children because they were doing lots of tests on,
2057400	2063240	on twins and genetics about like, can we, can we alter one, not the other? Like we can find a way
2063240	2068520	to fine tune making, you know, perfect little Aryan children. Right. And, and they use the
2068520	2073880	euthanasia program to do the kinds of esoteric medical experiments that would have been
2073880	2078840	impossible in cases where the patient was expected to live. Basically. What did you,
2078840	2084440	what did you, what did you find as you're, as you're delving into that darkness, you're reading
2085320	2090840	so many books, letters, you know, your, your, your, your knee deep in that world. So did you come away
2090840	2097240	with it with an impression about what our obsession with eugenics was? Was it a genuine,
2097240	2103960	was it face value of fear that we were going to mongrelize ourselves into extinction or was it,
2103960	2110680	was it just a, uh, uh, just a completely dishonest, like, you know, here's the deal.
2110680	2116840	Like in the, while I was writing that chapter, I saw an ad from some startup dude who was, uh,
2117640	2122360	basically selling some kind of new genomic scanning technology. And he was talking about
2122360	2128440	things like autism and ADHD and dyslexia as like glitches in the human program. And you know,
2128440	2134760	we can finally fine tune, you know, our own code so that we can eliminate these glitches. It was
2134760	2140200	sort of like, that's exactly what eugenics came out of. The notion that we can perfect humanity
2140200	2145400	by eliminating difference. But there's a, I mean, and, and, and again, I'll use the word irony,
2145400	2150760	but, uh, really fittingly, because the, the, the neurotypicals that are the villains in this
2150760	2154600	story, if there are any, these neurotypicals define that word for me. What does that mean?
2154600	2159560	It's just a, you know, non-autistic people. And that's a word invented by autistic people.
2159560	2163320	And so it was, it was sort of a hack because it was a wonderful word
2163320	2168680	because instead of always being medicalized by us that allowed them to medicalize us,
2169400	2173800	it was, it was invented on the internet in the late nineties. So they seem to have a capacity
2173800	2180680	for racism, which is not founded on logic. Like, like, no, no, the neurotypical, which,
2180680	2184680	but the, isn't it, isn't that a little strange? I kept, I kept, I kept waiting to hear,
2184680	2190760	hear stories about, you know, Hans Asperger, like, like, yeah, he was surrounded by Nazis and
2190760	2196680	completely incentivized to, to tow the line to the point where you're cautiously assuming that
2196680	2201320	if we saw every moment of his life, we probably would cluck our tongues. Cause he, he, we probably
2201320	2210680	would. And, and, and, and, but, but he, like the weird thing is that we have this tribe of,
2210680	2218680	of cognitively variant people who, because of their seclusion, because they, they, they, they
2218680	2225640	tend to propel us societally towards things like ham radio, which, which is, we'll talk about that
2225640	2230920	advent in a second, because of how fascinating it is, how it just absolutely is that autistic people
2230920	2235960	have been trying to make the internet since before there was internet laying around. And,
2235960	2242760	and that we all, we all love that world. We all love emoticons. We all love Facebook. We all love,
2242760	2248760	but in no uncertain terms, it's not because you've done the research now. So it may have been tacky
2248760	2253080	before reading this book to say, yeah, autistic people, they, they invented the internet autistic
2253080	2257160	people invented the computer languages that we use and autistic people invented that stuff.
2257160	2261000	Maybe that would have been something that, but it's clear from your book. I mean, it is,
2261000	2265400	it's a, it's a general fact that you can say. That's the thing. Before I wrote this book,
2265400	2269800	I wrote for 15 years for Wired magazine. And so people were constantly saying like,
2269800	2274280	Oh, he's on the spectrum. Oh, Bill Gates, he's on the spectrum. Steve Jobs on the spectrum.
2274280	2278600	And so I actually went to look to figure out what the history was like,
2278600	2282280	what were these people who would now say would be super geeks on the spectrum?
2282280	2286120	What were they doing before there was an internet and they were talking to each other
2286120	2291160	through Morse code over ham radio, because there was no facial signals to parse.
2292520	2297640	You could obsess about your favorite technology and really get rewarded for it.
2297640	2302840	You could leave your old, bullied, geeky, nerdily identity behind and become like this
2302840	2307960	amazing person on the internet with your or not the internet ham radio with your call letters.
2307960	2314280	And so it was a strict meritocracy like programming is. So it didn't matter if you were a total dork,
2314280	2322040	like if you could do the shit, you were cool. And the ham radio community and also the science
2322040	2327880	fiction fandom community were both organized by the same guy who I write about in the book
2327880	2332040	named Hugo Gernsback, who almost certainly had Asperger's syndrome. And by the way,
2332040	2337240	I do want to say I'm not just diagnosing people willy nilly. Like if I say in the book that
2337240	2341800	somebody probably had Asperger's syndrome, there's always a higher authority involved,
2341800	2346840	like Oliver Sacks, or in this case, it's Hugo Gernsback's biographer Gary Westfall,
2346840	2352920	believed he was Aspergian. Anyway, he was a very weird guy, but he had a genius idea,
2352920	2359160	which was to make home electronics available to hobbyists rather than just scientists.
2359160	2364520	In other words, really cool kids, like they could order stuff from his mail order catalog,
2364520	2369080	put it together and become a ham radio operator. And in those catalogs, there's pictures of
2369080	2374920	nerdy kids. And he sort of developed this culture that when you look back at the 50s,
2374920	2380440	you're like, oh, the whole comic con, everything kind of like all of a sudden comes together,
2380440	2387480	it all snaps together, the culture of fandom, the culture of an overlapping with nerdiness,
2388040	2393080	our consumption of pop culture, there's always been a fascination with science fiction associated
2393080	2399640	with people on the spectrum. And it's because of the ability to logically consume it,
2399640	2404440	the fact that you're talking about worlds built from scratch, which can make more sense than the
2404440	2408840	confusing worlds described in catcher in the rye, which is a great Gatsby. It's like, what,
2408840	2414120	I guess he was rich. What am I learning from this book? Whereas it's like, you know,
2414120	2418520	Zeeps and Florb landed in his space pod and stepped up. It's like, I can access every aspect
2418520	2424040	of this. And I can, you know, the, the, the, the first fan zines, and in fact, the word fandom,
2424040	2428680	the concept of fanaticism, fan groups and things that all came out of the ham radio culture,
2428680	2435240	which was connected to this, this science fiction, pulp, pulp culture, comic books and catalogs
2435240	2441080	where you could buy chemistry kits and like the, yeah. And it was all started by, you know, a guy
2441080	2447560	who clearly wanted to create his own world where, and not only that, but he was his best bud was
2447640	2453960	Nikola Tesla. Right. Nikola Tesla had the chops to design that future world. Do you have,
2454600	2457480	that's why I wanted you to bring your book up because that's one of the passages I was hoping
2457480	2461400	you could, there's two passages I was, I don't know if you can like, willy nilly, like, like
2461400	2469880	page them up, but one of them is Tesla talking about the future, describing, you know, what the
2469880	2477080	world is going to be like. Do you put Tesla on the spectrum? He's, he wasn't neurotypical.
2477080	2481640	I actually don't retro diagnose him, but he had many, many autistic traits. He was like fascinated
2481640	2489080	with glittering things. And he was very, very honest. So like, when his two aunts asked him
2489080	2493320	who was more attractive, he said something like, well, you're not, you're not quite as ugly as the
2493320	2499160	other. So he had that aspergy and utter frankness. Yeah. Well, after you, I have a question,
2499160	2506200	but maybe we'll do after you read this passage. If I can find it, that is maybe I can talk about
2506200	2513560	it. Here it is. I got it. Okay. Okay. Quote, when wireless, meaning ham radio, when wireless is
2513560	2519320	perfectly applied, the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain. Tesla told an
2519320	2525080	interviewer in 1926, we shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of
2525080	2530840	distance, not only this, but through television and telephony, we shall see and hear one another
2530840	2535720	as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of
2535720	2542040	miles. Face time. Exactly. And the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will
2542040	2547160	be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in
2547160	2552920	his vest pocket. We shall be able to witness and hear events, the inauguration of a president,
2552920	2557800	the playing of a world series game, the havoc of an earthquake or the terror of a battle,
2557800	2564920	just as though we were present. This is 1926 people. I mean, on one hand, it seems like a
2564920	2571400	no brainer, but yeah, kind of, that's because we're on a podcast. I mean, like Tesla, Tesla,
2571400	2576760	again, it's like Tesla and Asperger, both not probably not neurotypical and their rivals,
2576760	2584280	they're successful, trademarking, like dominant guys who, who, who popular, popular fringe culture,
2584280	2591240	oxymoron has it that, that Edison, you know, there's backward things about our current society
2591240	2599880	that are, that are, that are hard baked into it because Tesla's like more populist, empowering,
2599880	2606280	I don't know, his, his, his, going back to AC versus DC, and, you know, just Edison's proficiency
2606280	2611240	for trademarking and patenting, and his desire for hegemony, like, like, like, like, like,
2611240	2619320	conquering Tesla's reclusive, fanatical desire for everything to make sense. Right. And one of
2619320	2625800	Asperger's artistic traits was that he was able to resist peer pressure. So, you know,
2625800	2630760	while everybody else around him was thinking in terms of eliminating difference, he said something
2630760	2635640	like, that which is different from the norm is not necessarily inferior, which was a very
2635640	2639480	un-Nazi like thing to say. Because there's a skepticism. So that's what I, what I was seeing
2639480	2648360	before my train of thought got, got remarkably tangentialized. This idea that the, like, it's
2648360	2658360	the neurotypical of the world who are, have, seem to have a gift for politics, racism, war, seduction,
2659800	2669000	charm, I guess, yeah, diplomacy, you know, white, white lies, flattery. Yeah, fashion, hygiene. Yes,
2669000	2680520	exactly. Like, like, like, they sitting right here. They, they, but the weird thing about it is
2681240	2688840	these are all like, like, it's, it's, these are all things that if an autistic kid wants to memorize
2688840	2693720	a map of Los Angeles, you know, my friend Chris McKenna has a couple of autistic loved ones in
2693720	2699320	his family and describing that they're, they're one of their obsession with like roadmaps and
2699320	2702760	things. And like, just every time he meets somebody asks them, where are they coming from? And where
2702760	2707080	are they going? And then he had, and then that's his conversation is that instead of small talk,
2707080	2712920	he, he can tell him a better route to take next time they drive. Can I just jump in until a little
2712920	2719560	anecdote? I went to an autistic retreat. So I was one of the very few neurotypical people with like
2719560	2724920	about 70 autistic people of all ages. And the second day that I was there, I went up to a guy
2724920	2730680	who I thought was cool the night before. And I said, Hey, man, how'd you sleep? And he said, why?
2733400	2740440	It was like an excellent question. I realized like how much fucking energy I put into like
2740440	2746520	reputation management. Like every time I walk into a room, hi, how'd you sleep? I'm charming.
2746520	2755240	You know, I mean, I have to share this because it's something like, and I have no idea if the
2755240	2759160	person I'm talking about is, I'm not certainly not qualified to diagnose anything, but, but there's
2759160	2764760	such a, I had an encounter like that where I went up to somebody at a party and I said, I stood next
2764760	2769720	to him and I was like, I was like, this guy, he gets picked down by people. I'm going to, I love
2769720	2774200	him. Like I'm an outcast. I'm going to, I'm going to log some hours here. I'm going to be a wonderful
2774200	2780440	guy. And like, like, like, let's, and like, I'm going to talk to him, not, not, not cool people.
2780440	2785000	And, and so I stand next to him and I look around the party and go, wow, looks like everybody's
2785000	2793080	here. And he, and he, and he's like, just spent the next eight minutes in a monologue about how
2793080	2798120	I'm like, well, I didn't get the list of people that should be here. I wouldn't be able to compare
2798120	2802600	that thing. It was, it was maddening because in my mind I was thinking, you little prick,
2804440	2809480	I'm, I'm stupid here. You know, like, and it's like, that happens on a cellular level all the
2809480	2813720	time in, in interactions. But like what's at the core of it, of course, when you take a step back
2813720	2817880	from it, it's like, like you said, like, why am I, why am I asking how someone slept? What is it?
2817880	2821160	Yeah. We could have, we could have, we could have spent that time inventing something.
2821160	2828040	Right. Right. I love the, the, this early science fiction fandom nickname for neurotypicals was
2828120	2834280	the mundane. And so it's like, those are the people who think they rule the world.
2834280	2839720	So actually the mugwumps, how easy is it to go back and reverse diagnose people? Like, I mean,
2839720	2844360	you, like, are there certain, like, can you look back at Dostoyevsky or Chaucer or these people,
2844360	2849800	like, or for instance, like, is there, is there a way to kind of definitively say,
2849800	2856600	or you can kind of guess and it's, yeah, well, some people are much more promiscuous about their
2856600	2863480	retro diagnosing than I am. Like I'm a science writer, so I have to be strict. Right. That's
2863480	2867160	another thing. Like when I did, I was in Wired and I did that interview where I told the guy at
2867160	2870600	the end of the interview, I was like, by the way, and I took a quiz online and it's like, maybe I'm,
2870600	2874520	I don't know that. And then I like seeing it in print, I'm like, so tacky. God,
2874520	2877880	like where there's tackiness, there must be etiquette. Is there a guiding principle for?
2878440	2884760	No, I mean, some people seriously self-diagnose and, you know, they're, I believe it's called
2884760	2890280	self-diagnosed peer supported in the autistic community. So it's like, basically if your peer,
2890280	2896120	you know, if you're allegedly autistic peers say, yes, you are like us, then it's cool. You know,
2897160	2902680	if you just declare yourself autistic and there's no sort of, no one to gauge yourself against,
2902680	2907000	it's not as cool. Right. But the thing that I'll say is, I mean, people often say to me,
2907000	2912040	don't you think we're just diagnosing weird kids too much? You know, I don't actually believe that
2912040	2918440	because virtually everyone who I've met who had an official diagnosis really did need like,
2918440	2923880	you know, special forms of support and whatever. And it had a hard time passing among the mundane.
2923880	2927400	Yeah. Well, you, and you, and you, you, in the beginning of your book, you talked about,
2927400	2933160	in your introduction, talking about the emergence of, of the concept of neurodiversity, which is
2933160	2938760	simply to say that ADHD, dyslexia, all of these things, which by the way, all of my friends,
2939000	2944360	like Justin Roiland, definitely ADHD, co-creator of this cartoon I made, like, like, like Joel
2944360	2949880	McHale, dyslexic, Rob Schwab, dyslexic, like probably ADD to like every, those, those, those
2949880	2955640	letters kind of like, if you live in Los Angeles and you make stuff, you're always like, and the
2955640	2959960	refreshing thing about your book is that you don't have to now think, um, I being tacky and fashionable
2959960	2965160	by diagnosing, it's just, well, these are traits. These are, these are autistic traits, you know,
2965240	2969800	like, like, like whatever, which are not rare, which are shared by Asperganoon. Right. And I mean,
2969800	2976360	when I first came across your community here, um, I thought that it was kind of like looking at
2976360	2981960	broad swaths of the spectrum through the other end of the telescope. Like most people look at,
2981960	2987640	you know, autism only through the medical end of the telescope, you know, but if you look at it
2987640	2993320	through the cultural, like that's why I called my book neurotribes instead of like some word related
2993400	2998920	to disorder. Like I don't claim to know what the order of the universe should be. So I avoid the
2998920	3003640	word disorder. Um, but it's, there are certainly, and if you just wanted to sell books, you would
3003640	3015560	have called it titties. There you go. Titties inside. Neuro titties. It's a pop-up book.
3015880	3022840	Someone's buying that domain name, right? I bet you anything can already exist.
3024440	3028520	Um, but you're right. I mean, I think, I think I'm cutting you off to, to, to talk about what you
3028520	3033240	were trying to talk about, which is that you're, you describe yourself as profoundly neurotypical.
3033240	3040120	I am. You, uh, you're, you're, um, you're very, very outgoing, friendly, and, and you admire,
3040120	3045800	you're a fan of the autistic community. Uh, as, as I also am in your case, it's,
3045800	3050520	it's not so much out of a sense of kinship. It's almost like a sort of like sibling kind of,
3050520	3056360	yeah, you, you, you actually admire the things, uh, that you, the qualities that you do not have.
3056360	3061160	Exactly. Great minds do not necessarily think a lot. And so you've been a messenger. I mean,
3061160	3067080	your book that you've written, you've surely noticed that the autistic community is, uh,
3067240	3070360	tell me if I'm wrong or right about this. Cause I just, that's how I found your book,
3070360	3074280	because I just check in with the autistic community because I find them amazing and
3074280	3078840	fascinating. And especially in the, in regards to their conflict with groups like autism speaks,
3079800	3085960	and the ironies that ensue, um, the, the, uh, the, and, and, and, you know, I've read,
3085960	3093240	I've read more than one, um, essay by an autistic adult, you know, sort of celebrating and, and also
3093240	3097960	rolling their eyes at the fact that it took a neurotypical to be the Marco Polo of autism's
3097960	3104120	China. Now these parents are listening, you know, that won't listen to us. Cause a neurotypical wrote
3104120	3109320	a New York times bestseller. Right. Right. Well, um, at my book launch, I was very,
3109320	3113720	very happy to see we had a party in the hate Ashbury in San Francisco, where I live.
3113720	3120120	And I was very, very happy to see actually autistic people in the audience. Um, because
3120120	3126200	usually there's like this huge divide between like the autism speaks parents and the clinicians
3126200	3132680	and the autistic people, but kind of everybody was in the same room there. And what was really great
3132680	3138120	was, um, at some point in the Q and a afterwards, somebody asked me like, what do you think the
3138120	3143320	virtues of getting a diagnosis in midlife are? And so while I'm thinking about that, I'm thinking
3143320	3149160	like, who the fuck I'm not supposed to answer that question. We have experts here. So,
3149880	3153960	you know, I asked if there was anybody in the autistic section, sort of, they were sitting
3153960	3159080	together. I wanted to answer that, wanted to answer the question. And this woman stood up
3159080	3164520	and she said, getting a diagnosis in midlife was like finding the Rosetta stone to myself.
3165560	3169000	It was like, holy fuck. I couldn't have come up with that. Is there a lot of,
3171080	3177400	is there a lot of tribal pride among us? Well, there is now, but that's after decades of like
3177400	3183320	being brutalized and exterminated. And, you know, I mean, yeah, it's, are there groups of
3183320	3187240	like autistic people like playing world of Warcraft in a room right now gone this fucking
3187240	3191800	mundane called me up earlier. And like, like, is it fun for them to rib us about being neurotypical?
3191800	3197080	Sure. Yeah, definitely. And not only that, like one of the first things that I figured out by
3197080	3201960	going to that artistic retreat was that most of the clinical stereotypes about autistic people
3201960	3206600	were completely wrong. Like there's this belief that artistic people like lack a sense of irony,
3206600	3212280	don't get satire and they don't really have a sense of humor. And so this one autistic
3212280	3215560	guy who had just been appointed to the national council on disability,
3215560	3222440	Ari Neiman of the autistic self advocacy network was introduced to the group. And so they were
3222440	3230360	doing flat paws, which is like turning this stigmatized behavior into a symbol of celebration.
3230360	3235880	And so from the back, this girl said, yeah, it was nice. Because it also doesn't create
3235880	3240200	this startling burst of sound that freaks them out, you know? So from the back of the room,
3240200	3245720	this young woman said, we love you, Ari, if we were capable of feeling such an emotion.
3249880	3255320	Yeah, the I mean, well, the the myth of the no feeling thing, I think that's that simply
3255320	3260600	comes from the fact that there's this weird skepticism, and I keep coming back to this,
3260600	3263560	this thing, I never get to finish this thought, because I don't really know what this thought is.
3263560	3267160	And it's something to do with the fact that, well, if you want to be systemic about life,
3269240	3275480	like the actual Spock, if he was a real alien being that thought logically about things,
3276280	3282200	would he or would he not be in favor of eugenics? Like, like, because when you apply
3282200	3287720	coal, this concept of the cold hard logic, and he's a science, he's like, he's a human calculator,
3287720	3294600	but obviously, not like, it's not there's more to it than that. There's one other passage,
3294600	3300760	if you can find it, it would be earlier in your book, it's about that guy that guy that the Tesla
3300760	3308920	of chemistry who Henry Cavendish, Henry Cavendish, yeah, my book opens unexpectedly, about 200 years
3308920	3315480	ago, because that allowed me to describe a very autistic person before there were these layers of
3315480	3321880	clinical cliches. Yeah. So I have the reactions of the other people around him who had no idea
3321880	3328760	what to make of his fascinating peculiarities or whatever. And he was a guy who took the same walk
3328760	3332600	at the same time every night, wear the same clothes every day, when they would wear out,
3332600	3337960	he would tell his tailor to make an identical outfit. He ate the same dish at every meal,
3337960	3345320	leg of mutton. There was a chambermaid who surprised him on the steps with a broom and
3345320	3350920	so he ordered a new set of steps so that it wouldn't happen again. That's not the same
3350920	3356760	cold hard logic that goes into genocide. Or, you know, there's no laziness there.
3358440	3366200	He practically invented science, like he measured the density of the earth in a shack in his
3366200	3371400	backyard. He figured out how to do it with pendulums. And it was like the best estimate
3371400	3377240	of the density of the earth for a hundred years or whatever. And he didn't just do science,
3377240	3384200	he invented fields of science. And yet he was completely immobilized practically at parties,
3384200	3389960	like he would just stand off to the side, listening, looking away. And that was something
3389960	3395560	that Asperger picked up on, like, you know, Connor was like, they fail to make eye contact,
3395560	3399960	you know. But Asperger was like, no, actually, they're learning really a lot about the world.
3400040	3403640	They're just not looking at you. Right. Because looking at you is actually
3403640	3408760	overloading their senses. And there was a colleague who described him. Do you remember
3408760	3413560	the light metaphor, the white light? Right, a cold light, which warms nothing.
3413560	3418200	Yeah, I suppose you could find that. I'll just use you as a Google engine.
3421320	3424520	But have you been traveling all over the country world,
3425160	3428600	doing readings and selling this? Well, this just came out like two and a half weeks ago.
3428600	3432840	So it, like, hopped on the bestseller list. So that's good.
3439320	3444280	But don't we need different words for things like compassion in a world where
3444920	3451560	the people who have been responsible for creating a more Roddenberry-like world
3452520	3460360	are accused of, are describable as not having it. And yet the people who have been trying to cure
3460360	3465000	them in childhood are people who are cattle prodding them. Right, right. The people who
3465000	3469800	supposedly have the empathy that these people lack are the people sticking cattle prods.
3469800	3473400	I feel like there's a word we're missing in the English language that maybe an autistic person
3473400	3479400	could invent for us. So that we can stop making that, that there's a distinction we're making
3479400	3484920	that's not 100% accurate about whether they're feeling things. Yeah, that's true. And the great
3484920	3490600	thing is that once the internet was finally invented, and I talk about how a very autistic
3490600	3495000	person helped invent the first social network that was open to the public, actually, this guy,
3495000	3500120	Lee Felsenstein. But anyway, the internet gave a place to autistic people where they could talk
3500120	3505800	to each other, rather than just talking to clinicians. So instead of being isolated patients
3505800	3510600	brought there by their parents, they could just talk to each other. And one of the first things
3510600	3516200	they figured out was that autism persists into adulthood. Like believe it or not, this is one
3516200	3523000	of the things that most people forget. But up until the 70s or 80s, really the 80s, the diagnosis was
3523000	3528200	not really available to adults or even teenagers in Americans. And people say, why are the rates
3528200	3534680	of diagnosis going up? One reason is that teenagers and adults could not get the diagnosis
3534680	3540200	until the 80s and 90s. And that was one thing that Asperger syndrome was good for. It's simply
3540200	3545160	like, yeah, it's the Wendy's and Burger King of, which is neither a good thing or a bad thing. It's
3545160	3551880	like we've developed since the early 80s, systems that are now available to clinicians to diagnose
3551880	3556200	autism. Right. And so the diagnosis just went through the roof. And also another thing that
3556200	3562040	people I would say under appreciate generally, even some autistic people is Rain Man. Like people
3562040	3567560	think, Oh, what a cliche. Dustin Hoffman, Raymond Babbitt with the cards and the toothpicks, whatever.
3567560	3572520	But actually that film was completely revolutionary because even people who had
3572520	3579400	been in autism circles for decades had never seen an autistic adult on certainly on screen ever.
3579960	3586920	And so Raymond Babbitt made autism recognizable to teachers, to parents, to autistic people
3586920	3593320	themselves, to clinicians. And so that was one of the sort of elements of the perfect storm of
3593320	3598280	autism awareness that created the apparent epidemic. Steve, I know I'm totally ignorant
3598280	3604600	about autism. Is it a strictly neurological thing? Is it a developmental thing in the brain?
3605320	3610520	Yes. Although we still don't have a bio marker for it. So there are no blood tests for autism.
3610520	3616840	There are no brain scans for autism. Can you scan brains and see similarities?
3617880	3622680	Well, that's the subject of much debate. But the problem is that every six months,
3622680	3627000	another study comes out. It's too much white matter. It's too little white matter. It's too
3627000	3631800	much connectivity. It's too little connectivity. You know, it's like there are all these conflicting
3631800	3636680	studies about what the biomarkers of autism are. It's certainly hereditary. That was one of the
3636680	3641400	basic aspects. On one hand, you have a spike in diagnosis because that's, I suppose, the biggest
3641400	3645160	question that your book would need to answer that someone would come to is what's going on with this
3645160	3654680	autism epidemic and what you get right to in the opening of the book and slowly answer throughout
3654680	3660520	the book. And it seems to be, correct me if I'm wrong, the two biggest factors are what we just
3660520	3668680	talked about, the increased availability of the diagnosis. But you hint at, earlier in the book,
3669400	3679720	this odd, it's an engineer's disease that it does seem hereditary and that our modern world,
3679720	3686600	created by autistics, our Jetson world that we all love, that we all fantasize about in science
3686600	3694680	fiction, that autistics make a reality by actually thinking outside the actual box. That world in a
3694680	3702680	crazy poetic fairy tale makes it possible basically for engineers to fuck more. Exactly.
3703960	3709000	That people who used to be defined by their virginity are now able to hook up.
3709720	3712200	Dan, you were saying yesterday, I don't know if it was from Steve's book or not,
3713240	3717800	that Silicon Valley is seeing a big rise of autistic birth rate or something like that?
3717800	3724040	Well, that was the subject of my article, The Geek Syndrome in 2001. And yes, that's interesting,
3725000	3729880	and that might be happening. Geneticists call it assortative mating, which is basically when
3729880	3735800	people who are carrying traits for a certain condition get together, there's more of a chance
3735800	3741240	that their kid will have the condition. And that's how I first got into autism, because I'm not a
3741240	3748440	parent, I'm not a relative. I now have an autistic trans nephew, I will say. But I got into it because
3748520	3754600	I was on a boat with 100 computer programmers. And towards the end of this cruise in Alaska,
3754600	3759960	I asked this big programmer guy, Larry Wall, if I could come to interview him at his house.
3759960	3766360	And I noticed that he had customized his house, like he had turned the buzzer on his clothes
3766360	3773000	dryer to a light. So it was not so startling and annoying. And he said, yeah, you can come to my
3773000	3778520	house, but I should tell you, we have a profoundly autistic daughter. And then like six months later,
3778520	3782520	I was writing about another family in Silicon Valley, can I come to your house? A woman said,
3782520	3787080	yeah, by the way, we have an autistic daughter. And I thought, hmm, that's odd. And the next day,
3787080	3791560	I was in a cafe in San Francisco telling that exact story to a friend of mine. And this woman
3791560	3798360	at the next table said, Oh, my God, do you realize what's going on? There's an epidemic of autism in
3798360	3803800	Silicon Valley. And so like the hairs on the back of my neck went up, you know, and that turned out
3803800	3809720	to be like a doorway through which I stepped into the next, you know, 15 years of my life. And this
3809720	3815960	book is an attempt to get right what I sort of bunted on in the geek syndrome. Because yes,
3815960	3820840	it's sort of mating is fascinating. All these Dungeons and Dragons people getting together
3820840	3823400	by talking through finding their way through dungeons.
3824200	3824600	Exactly.
3824600	3830040	Increasing efficiency. Right, right. So to be a map on a graph paper, now you can like,
3830040	3836040	use a computer to get through that dungeon. Right. And so that's interesting. But why are autism
3836040	3841240	rates also going up in rural Alaska, for instance, you know, might be Dungeons and Dragons there,
3841240	3848440	too. But anyway, so this was my effort to get right what I sort of wimped out on in geek syndrome.
3848440	3852200	Yeah, it took me five years, it could be a whole I mean, it gets into a whole area of like,
3852200	3856760	what is the nature of evolution? Why does a stable Fox? Why does its Fergut in value,
3856760	3862920	non valuable within one, you know, what is everything operating on a pure Darwinian
3862920	3869160	mutation engine? Or do we do we store you know, what is their feedback going into DNA? Are we
3869160	3878680	therefore expressing our own evolution through increased incidents of, of a more of a disease,
3878760	3885480	quote, unquote, disease, more compatible with, with an emerging world and also more causal of it?
3885480	3894760	Right. So very well said, increased skepticism of pig headed politicians increased desire to think
3894760	3901240	laterally increased need to to do to create a world that is not an assault on the senses.
3902440	3907800	I mean, is our species surviving the same as those goddamn giraffes with their long necks?
3909160	3915000	One of my favorite moments in in the book and in autism history is when Asperger asked a kid in
3915000	3920200	his clinic if he's religious. And he says, I don't like to say I'm not religious. I just don't have
3920200	3926600	any proof of God. And I feel like he was like, you know, a lot of people are like that now. Right.
3926600	3933480	You know, you foresee a showdown between the mundane and the autism. Did you see a great
3933480	3938360	apocalypse coming down the road? There's a continuous showdown. We, you know, we all have
3938360	3948920	to fight the good fight. As we're told in Quadrophenia, we are the mobs. I just think it might be
3950440	3958360	that beautiful. It's a colleague describing this. You know, your 200 year old retro diagnosis of
3958360	3965800	this guy who who time and time again, I mean, he discovered Argonne, you know, before the guy
3965800	3974280	that's credited with discovering Argonne. And it was one of the most like, like, just eloquent
3974280	3980600	ways of describing what the guy didn't know he was describing an autistic person. It just came from
3980600	3985160	a colleague. And I thought it was so interesting, the distinction between different kinds of light.
3985240	3989640	The most probing glimpse into the soul of this elusive genius, Henry Cavendish,
3989640	3994280	was provided by the chemist George Wilson, who wrote the first full length biography of Cavendish
3994280	4002360	in 1851, etc. He painted Cavendish's emotional life as a series of negations. He did not love,
4002360	4009240	he did not hate, he did not hope, he did not fear. His brain seems to have been but a calculating
4009240	4016520	engine. He was not a poet, a priest, or a prophet, but only a cold, clear intelligence,
4016520	4023080	wraying down pure white light, which brightened everything on which it fell, but warmed nothing.
4023080	4034440	Wow. I like it. And it's 9-11. Another cold light that warmed nothing.
4037400	4044280	Well, I, yeah, I, I, we flew you out from San Francisco. Is there, there's a, there's a,
4044280	4050600	like, like, I, like, do you, because you describe yourself as the, the prototypical, neurotypical
4050600	4054920	use, you were, except I'm secretly shy. Don't forget that part. Right. But then, and then you
4054920	4060440	talked about, you said you were married to a fellow that is a very autistic traits. Well,
4060440	4065560	he has more autistic traits than I do. And I thought, I thought in my head as a, as a, as a
4065560	4072920	hammy, tacky host, I was thinking like, is there, is there a way to weave these things? If you're,
4072920	4080120	because I, I was like, ah, as a gay journalist. Oh my God. Is there, is there a, did you ever
4080120	4085000	find yourself looking through that lens as your, as your, you know, this is a civil rights movement
4085000	4089960	that I'm happening among autistic people. Here's, here's the thing. Well, yes, certainly. Yeah. I
4089960	4096280	mean, I wrote, this is really the story of a people walking towards freedom out of the darkness,
4096280	4102840	more or less. And do I relate to that? Because now I'm a happily married gay man. Yes, totally.
4103560	4111480	Um, yeah, I guess that's all I wanted was applause. Yeah. I got it. I'm sorry. Steve,
4111480	4118680	are you saying that your husband is autistic? No. Sorry, Keith. You said you, you, you, you,
4118680	4123480	you both have a certain amount of autistic traits and he is more than I, so a neurotypical person,
4123480	4129480	a neurotypical person like you or I could have any number of autistic traits. Yes. For instance,
4129560	4134120	autistic traits are common. Like a love in this room who thinks they might have autistic traits.
4134120	4137880	Give me a, give me a for instance of, of, of yours, like what's, what's one of your autistic
4137880	4144040	traits of mine. Um, in social situations, I feel like I'm running out of energy and I really need
4144040	4150600	to get some place where I'm by myself and not so worn out by constant attention. All right. So
4150600	4159080	that's one, um, obsessive obsessive, uh, focus. Like once I figured out that the same guy had worked
4159160	4163800	for both Connor and Asperger, thus answering one of the huge mysteries of autism history,
4163800	4170520	I was fucking obsessed. Like I, I ended up, I remember this moment when I really wanted to
4170520	4177480	be able to see a room in Vienna in 1938. So I literally like plowed through Google images
4177480	4183400	until I found a picture of that room with the portrait of Hitler behind the podium. And it was
4183400	4191800	like, yes, I am God. I can see into a room in 1938. How would you describe when your research,
4191800	4199320	that's a question I have as a dropout journalism major and a, uh, like, uh, because I sometimes
4199320	4206200	find like, I, I tried to find out how coconuts work the other day and I was astounded that there
4206200	4211000	was no information about it online. Not that, not the specific kind I needed. There was so much of
4211000	4215880	one guy as a person who doesn't know the mechanism and the coconut that confuses you the most. Yeah.
4216920	4220760	So you didn't get to the bottom of that. I didn't, I didn't understand. I couldn't look,
4220760	4225240	I was looking at a coconut. I had ordered a coconut filled with ice cream from my local
4225240	4231640	vegan store because I'm healthy. And, uh, and I was eating out of the coconut coconut ice cream.
4231640	4236680	And I was like, this thing is fucking amazing. It's so good. And I started looking up coconuts
4236680	4241640	and it was like, yeah, like you could make oil and all this shit. Like, like, like, it was like,
4241640	4247720	but the thing that kept plaguing me was like, why would a tree, trees, like an apple is designed
4247720	4252360	to make a chimp want to eat it or a raccoon or something. So it poops out the seeds somewhere
4252360	4257000	other than where the tree is. So I kept thinking like, what, why would you play this hard to get
4257000	4261880	as a, as a tree? The answer is obvious to anyone who probably, there's probably like, you know,
4261880	4267480	30 people tweeted me in 10 seconds, but not, not until after I was amazed that I could Google it
4267480	4273240	and, and within an hour not have found the very, very simple, obvious answer that probably people
4273240	4278280	who grew up in Hawaii, like know immediately or whatever, it's like, no, they're designed to float.
4278280	4283480	They've bypassed mammalian technology there and probably predated it. A coconut is a little
4283480	4288680	waterproof submarine, a boat, um, with a little bit of potable water in it and a bunch of sperm
4288680	4292920	and a bunch of coconut egg. Like, and like, it's designed to like float to another island and grow
4292920	4300520	to fucking brilliant. I once had a question like that for Oliver Sacks, who is the recently
4300520	4304520	deceased, unfortunately neurologist who actually wrote the forward to my book and was a very good
4304520	4308920	friend of mine and a wonderful guy. He wrote books like the man in mistook his wife for a hat.
4308920	4314920	Anyway, we were once in a health food store or whatever, and I picked up this bunch of sage leaves
4314920	4320200	that were very furry. And I knew that Oliver was not only a neurologist, but a botanist kind of.
4320200	4325400	And so I said to him, I wonder why sage has such furry leaves? And he looked at me and he said,
4325400	4339160	because they like it. That's an unsatisfying answer. And you're like, do you like hanging
4339160	4345480	out with me? Like, I wanted you to come have a barbecue, but if you're bored or you want to
4345480	4353320	wait in the car, I'm just trying to make small talk, man. Now, did you obsess on the sage leaves
4353320	4358520	and go look that up? Did you ever? I didn't go. It was satisfying. I'm the same way. I'm a slow
4358520	4361960	reader. And I think, you know, Dan listened to your thing at double speed and it made you sound like,
4361960	4369080	uh, what's his name? I'm a fetishist with like paper books. I'm kind of a slow reader because
4369400	4375240	I have to stop, look up every word I've done. Or even if it's words I do know, I go, what's the
4375240	4381080	etymology of that? Like, and then I'll go down rabbit holes of where did that route come from?
4381080	4385000	And then, and then I have to go back to a bunch of other pages that reminds me of other words. And
4385000	4387960	then I have to look at all the pictures of the inside of the room. And if they reference a
4387960	4391960	painting, I have to look at all the artists' paintings. I did that for five years writing
4391960	4396760	this book. Well, that's what I wanted to ask of selfishly just to interrupt because that's my
4396760	4405960	thing is like, so if coconuts, uh, were president, no, no, no. Uh, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if I
4405960	4412440	can't, if I, if I can't, if I, if I can't, if I can't, if I can't just give me a second, if I can't
4412440	4418200	find out about coconuts in two hours on the internet, my question is how much information
4418200	4423160	is actually on the internet? You, you, you said this is a 15 year, you describe yourself as sitting
4423160	4429800	in stacks of books at universities. True. How much of our, how much of our information is, and
4429800	4436120	of what kind is making it over to the Skynet? Is there a bias toward a certain type of information?
4436120	4441720	Are we learning more about lightsabers and less about Bob Dylan and like, like, or is it, you know,
4441720	4447000	or more about those two things? And we know nothing about, did you, if you've spent two years
4447000	4452840	researching, I try, like, I try to port things into the internet that otherwise might not make
4452840	4457960	it. So if you guys have cool shit, whatever it is, like, that's not in digital form, just try to
4457960	4463480	make it available in digital form for people, you know, because some guy 300 years from now is going
4463480	4468520	to be writing the definitive book on something and he's going to find your shit and it's going to
4468520	4473880	like be the central piece in some enormous world solving puzzle. But also you're like finding out
4473880	4478840	all these amazing, like the fact that, well, we didn't even talk about this, by the way, Asperger,
4479560	4490440	he, Connor, to round out his role as villain, very clearly, like we, if you type those names
4490440	4495960	into the internet, you will see that they like simultaneously started diagnosing autistics at
4495960	4504200	the same time. Right. And you actually Woodward and Bernstein to this shit. Right. That's the thing.
4504200	4511240	For since forever, as they say, since forever, people have said that Asperger and Connor discovered
4511240	4516440	autism virtually simultaneously, an amazing synchronicity, one of the great medical synchronicities
4516440	4523400	of the 20th century, which I even say in the geek syndrome. Anyway, it turns out that Asperger had
4523400	4530920	this chief diagnostician named George Frankel and he had a Jewish problem with the Nazis. He was
4530920	4540200	Jewish. And so George Frankel was rescued from Vienna in 1938 by this guy in Baltimore named
4540200	4549240	Leo Connor. So the same guy, like for autism heads, like that's huge. Like it's a huge scoop.
4549240	4553880	But here's the crazy thing. So I'm reading the book and going, man, this Connor guy, what a villain.
4553880	4560600	And then he was heroic because he saved Jewish scientists and clinicians from the
4560600	4565800	Holocaust. So every basically everybody in my book is really complicated. And if he buried his
4565800	4570760	connection, his inspiration, he really buried, right. He may have done it because Asperger was
4570760	4576040	associated with Nazis. It may have been for an altruistic reason. Right. It may have been. So
4576040	4582680	yeah, here's the deal. So Connor in 1943 becomes the world's leading authority on autism.
4582680	4588680	Somehow for the next several decades, he never mentions Asperger's work, even though Asperger's
4588680	4594840	chief diagnostician and a woman named Ani Weiss also from Asperger's clinic were with Connor when
4594840	4599560	he quote unquote discovered autism. Like no one knew this before my book was written. And so
4600520	4606440	basically Connor never mentions Asperger's paper. So people say, well, he just didn't read it. It was
4606440	4611720	written in German, Connor's native language. Well, he somehow overlooked it because it was in this
4611720	4617400	obscure German medical journal, one that Connor cited numerous times in his work, you know. And
4617400	4623880	so the one time that Connor mentions Asperger's name in public is in this very dismissive book
4623880	4631160	review written in the 1970s. And he says, oh yes, Asperger. What that man discovered was at best,
4631160	4637800	a 42nd cousin of my syndrome and has already received serious attention from investigators,
4637800	4642360	which was total bullshit. It hadn't even been translated into English yet. Is that just male
4642440	4648840	douchebag ego stuff? Well, no, I mean, you know, is it male douchebag ego or is it that Connor suspected
4648840	4654840	that Asperger was a Nazi? Yeah, is it a shindler like subversion? Believe me, that was like the big,
4654840	4659080	you know, if I could like summon people with a time machine and say like, why did you do this
4659080	4664280	shit? You know, because the problem with burying Asperger in history was that it buried the concept
4664280	4671640	of the spectrum. So Connor defined autism very narrowly. And whereas Asperger had seen it as this
4671640	4676440	lifelong condition, ranging from people who couldn't talk at all to chatty astronomy
4676440	4685400	professors, etc. All in the upper tiers of society. And as an indirect, if not direct result of that,
4685400	4689560	sorry, why am I cutting you off to tell you about autism? Keep talking. Don't worry about it. So
4689560	4697640	basically, Connor buried autism and someone had to find it again, because this cognitive psychiatrist
4697640	4703640	in London named Lorna Wing figured out that Connor was wrong by basically walking through a suburb
4703640	4708680	of London called Camberwell looking for autistic kids. And oh my god, did she ever find them?
4708680	4713560	Many more than Connor's narrow model would have predicted. So she was like, who are all these
4713560	4718520	kids, these weird kids who would like play their favorite phonograph record 50 times over or,
4718520	4724200	you know, couldn't read social signals or, you know, one got one teenager had three wrist watches
4724200	4730840	because he kept them to various time zones. And guess what, in the in 1978, if you're one of those
4730840	4737320	kids and you're born black, you're because of that legacy of specialization of diagnosis,
4737320	4742360	you would get mental retardation. You don't come down that pachinko machine with Yeah, you don't,
4742360	4746360	you don't, you're not the kid in the hoodie in the independent movie who's hitting himself in the head.
4746360	4751160	You're, you're, you're just retarded because you're poor. Yeah. And that's like,
4752040	4758600	that made me want to people. And you know, the anti vaccine people, I don't want to
4758600	4763320	stereotype them either. But you know, they say stuff like, you know, Jenny McCarthy once said,
4763320	4770120	there were no autistic adults in the past. It's all now. Well, that would be news to my many
4770120	4775960	middle aged autistic friends, I have to say. But it would also be news to the two generations of
4775960	4781560	autistic people who ended up in institutions. So for 30 years, between the 40s and the 70s,
4782440	4787560	Asperger's findings were all they were in a journal, they had been, they were just buried.
4787560	4792440	Yeah, they were right. And, you know, there were like, make five guys in Eastern Europe who like
4792440	4797560	knew about his work, you know, 10 guys, that was unearthed how that was unearthed how because
4797560	4802360	Lorna Wing did one of the first basic prevalence studies of autism in the general population.
4802360	4807160	In other words, unlike Connor, she didn't wait for autistic kids to come to her office.
4807800	4812600	She and a colleague named Judith Gould went out and pounded the pavement and like dug through
4812600	4817960	medical records and special schools and all this to look for autistic kids. And she saw so many of
4817960	4822760	them. She was like, what the fuck? Like, what is going on? Like, why didn't anyone notice these
4822760	4828840	kids before? And so then she stumbles over a reference to Asperger's paper. And it was
4828840	4832920	actually in a journal that Connor edited. And it was a paper designed to make Asperger's
4833720	4838440	work look like a separate thing anyway. But she's like, what is this paper? Who is this Asperger?
4838440	4843400	She didn't speak German. Her husband did. He translated it for her. She reads and it's like,
4843400	4849240	this is it. This is the autistic continuum. That's what she called it at first. But she eventually
4849240	4853880	thought Continuum was like two, maybe two science fiction, or something, you know, too dry.
4854920	4860280	Well, it suggests that there's no distinction. Right. Spectrum suggests a rainbow. Right.
4860280	4865960	And plus, it was like a nice natural image, you know. So yeah, basically, the concept of the
4865960	4872840	autism spectrum came from Lorna Wing rediscovering Asperger's work after it had been buried by Connor
4872840	4880520	for many, many decades. Is there is there before we before we let you go, we've milked you dry,
4880520	4889720	like, I really appreciate this. Amazing. An amazing interview, which I'll credit myself.
4890920	4896520	Absolutely. I really done a good job interviewing you. I did a good job booking you. We had a New
4896520	4905320	York Times best seller on our show about autism, which all of you clearly have. I did I did a solid
4905320	4916280	for all of society and I wove gay people into it. I'm the greatest man alive tonight. But I want to
4916280	4922200	throw you a bone. So is there anything? What kind of bone exactly? I know you're kind of like,
4922280	4929160	I know you're I know you're a Ginsburg fan. You're from San Francisco. You're from the land of beat
4929160	4934600	poets. I mean, like, like, like I we got applause from from my favorite passages from the book. And
4934600	4938680	I don't want to I don't want to just like awkwardly and autistically bid you goodbye. Like, do you
4938680	4944120	is there? Do you have a favorite? Like, like, kind of like I'm nailing it here. Or this is a great,
4944120	4947400	great part of my book that I love reading out loud. Oh, my God. Anything you want to share?
4948280	4954360	I don't want to do that. But thank you. I appreciate it. Read the book if you want. Yeah, okay. I'm
4954360	4958920	gonna go right out and get it. You can listen to it at 2.0 speed. It sounds like Mark Scorsese.
4958920	4965640	It's a 16 hour book that way. Oh, can I can I tell you one thing? I saw someone here before
4965640	4970840	bringing this really cool piece of fan art. The really cool piece of fan art that somebody made
4970840	4978840	for me about this book was it was bootleg audio cassettes of this book. So it looked like dead
4978840	4985080	tapes, basically. It was very cool. All right, cool. Well, thank you, Steve Silverman, author of
4985080	4992280	neurotribes neurotypical hero to the neural neurologically diverse world. Thank you, buddy.
4992280	4995720	Thank you, Steve. God bless you.
5007640	5012920	It's called the legacy of autism, the neurotribes, the legacy of autism and the future of neuro
5012920	5017560	adversity by Steve Silverman with a B. Let's get my wife out here. I'm sorry. She's back there.
5022280	5043800	Hi, everybody. Welcome home. Hi, how's tings? What's the crack? I was gonna say,

5118360	5123240	sweetened. It's it's sweet. I love it. It has calories on it. It's like supposed to be like
5123240	5129880	halfway between Diet Coke and life other things. And it's talking to so good. All right. My Lord
5129880	5134280	Dan, these are for you. These are jelly babies. Oh, oh, shit. Tractor who eats them?

5146760	5151480	I didn't realize like, was I nervous about coming back to harm in town and did I buy chocolate so
5151480	5155480	everyone would be happy to see me somebody throwing bags of chocolate to a crowd is never sad.
5156040	5159640	Oh, Dustin, this is for you. This is an energy drink called relentless.
5164520	5170120	Relentless. There's a there's a there's a there's a there's a
5172760	5174120	Morrissey head on the
5174120	5184040	It's more Morrissey's face in a star at the bottom of the can.
5184600	5191720	It's him going like instant energy. And when to mortgage comes out, these are this is puddles
5191720	5199480	by Cadbury. Oh, shit puddles. All right. Well, goodbye. Going back. Well, let's get to mortgage
5199480	5210280	out here then. Demorge Brown, you want to come join us? Oh, yeah. By the way, the song we're
5210280	5214280	hearing tonight is by our good friend Titanic Sinclair and it's called the ghost of harm in
5214280	5219800	town. It's good stuff. Demorge. Apparently, Erin thought of you when she saw a puddle.
5221240	5228360	I don't know what I did with the puddles. That's it's a Cadbury Oreo. All right, here we go. Oh,
5228360	5232120	yeah. Yeah, there we go. Much better. Yeah, I got a little crush. Is it a fruit nut?
5233000	5238680	Is there a fruit? Smooth mint? Yeah, a fruit and nut one is a goodie. This is the word. All right.
5238680	5245160	Well, we got for shadow run. We got night blade. Just right back at it. This is. Oh, yeah. Can we
5245160	5251080	talk about this enormous piece of fan art? Speaking of aspergy and fan arts as aspergy in
5252040	5254920	Can we see what this is? This looks spectacular. It's a piece of cardboard.
5256360	5261960	You should turn it with our mayor's image. You should turn it and show the angles. Yeah,
5261960	5269960	so the it's very cool. It's radiant on it. This one's no good. Wow. Look at that. She wants you
5269960	5283240	guys to sign that. All right. Oh, Dan. You're not the guy that did that masking tape.
5284360	5287480	Harmony. No, is that is that guy here? Okay. What's your name?
5288600	5294840	Fuck you, buddy. What are your names? A friend that made the art for us? What's your name?
5294840	5301640	My name is Elliot. Did you do both of these? And your name is what, miss? Nicole. Nicole and
5301640	5305800	Elliot. Thank you so much. It's really, really groovy. And that guy made me a masking tape.
5305800	5310360	Harmon. It's like all made a masking tape and then like a lacquer over it that I still have.
5311160	5317800	And then I accidentally blocked him on Twitter. He was a casualty of the Harmon block that we've
5317800	5324040	talked about, which has overall given me a great deal of mental stability. But there are sometimes
5324120	5329240	I had to some someone else on Twitter had to send me a link to a place where people who get
5329240	5338680	Harmon block to congregate and talk about whether their blocking was just yeah. And they're very
5338680	5343080	and it's it's a sad, sad smith village. Do they have different do they have different
5343080	5349560	like leagues among them? Like I didn't deserve it. I just saw I just saw all I saw was the guy
5349560	5354200	saying like I made him a masking tape. Harmon and I was like, well, that that guy shouldn't
5354200	5358200	have been blocked. He didn't. Do you remember the circumstances of why you blocked him? I
5358200	5364840	blocked people who like so like if you and I, you know, if we if we if we're joking around, like,
5364840	5369960	like, you know, like sometimes there's some razzing, you know, like we razz each other.
5370520	5377560	Sometimes when strangers razz me, I bought taking the Mickey. Yeah, like, like, like sometimes
5377560	5382760	sometimes unearned rat like I have a I have I have an arbitrary definition for unearned razzing,
5382760	5388120	you know, I like it's like it's for the reason I started blocking is for my own protection.
5388120	5391640	I was like, I was like, well, I don't want to get I don't want to Joss Wheaton out of the Twitter.
5392600	5398280	Like, I'll just like there's so many people on here that just want to say, I love you and hear
5398280	5404120	me say I love you back. And like why so you just block people, but you don't have to hate them or
5404120	5408680	judge them. You just go like, it's if I make a joke, and then somebody says get over yourself,
5408680	5413160	like, and then I go, well, that's not why I get on Twitter. I love that mute button. I love that
5413160	5417560	Twitter mute button. Yeah, it's a good button. If you say if you've mentioned the words teen and
5417560	5423560	wolf on my Twitter, I think I got somebody by accident today. She was making a joke about
5423560	5427160	something else. But she said teen wolf and I instantly was like, I was like, I have a,
5428040	5433400	like a standard reply that I have on a little sticky note that I cut and paste to all the people.
5433400	5436440	So I don't have to keep writing that I'm not the guy that fucking made teen wolf.
5437960	5440600	Mute buttons not enough for me. That would be enough for a healthy person.
5441560	5447800	Blocking and specifically, I have to also then advertise the block with a hashtag. And then I'm
5447800	5455080	like, so you have to bury them and then dance on their grave. Yeah. Yeah. And then sometimes it's
5455080	5461000	tragedy. You never just mute. You never just go a cornfield. Did you kiss the Blarty stone?
5463640	5466920	I did not kiss the Blarty stone. I didn't make it to the Blarty stone.
5466920	5469080	Good. Cause that would be cheating on me.
5473880	5476920	You didn't cheat on me. You were in Europe for a month.
5477800	5484920	More than a month. Surrounded by handsome, non McDonald's, uh, indoctrinated men
5486200	5490680	with abdominal muscles. They have all of them look like Colin Farrell. Yeah,
5490760	5493240	it's all, it's hard to tell apart. All of them have names like Mally O'Malley.
5494360	5499000	They do. Uh, yeah, yeah. I'll miss that. They all, it was funny. Like we, I just, uh,
5499000	5504360	this last week was, was shooting what I think will be a web series around Ireland. And wherever we
5504360	5508600	went, I was there with, uh, two, two Irish guys that were helping me and they would run into
5508600	5512360	somebody and they'd be like, Oh, you're from Limerick. Do you know Sean O'Connor? Do you know,
5512360	5516520	but like the names are so generic. I was like, there must be a house in Sean O'Connor's. They're
5516520	5523320	like Michael Mally's and all that. Um, you think it's going to be a web series. Sorry.
5523320	5529160	You think it's going to be a web series. Well, I shot, I shot this thing that I'm calling
5529160	5534280	McGathey in Ireland, which was like a parody of a travel show where I'm playing like an exaggerated
5534280	5541160	version of myself going around Ireland and, uh, and being emotionally self-destructive and stuff.
5541160	5546360	And I say, I say, I think it's going to be a web series because I'm not sure exactly
5546360	5550120	what it's going to be. Maybe it's going to be a, I don't know. I just shot a lot and figuring it
5550120	5558840	out. Could be about a one woman show. Sorry. A one woman show. Uh, it won't be a one woman show
5558840	5564840	because that would be weird. Um, you mean if I, if I was to watch all the footage and then transcribe
5564840	5570840	it and then perform it as a one woman show or what about like a mixed media mosaic? Yeah.
5572200	5575160	Do you think it could be that? Do you think it could be a mixed media mosaic?
5575160	5578440	I think, I think that's a good idea. Well, I like web series though. I'm going to,
5578440	5581640	yeah. Aaron, while you were away, Spencer became an idea man.
5584840	5589320	But, but, but he's become oddly confined in his thinking about what's possible. It's like,
5589320	5594280	he used to be so much freer, but he's really, like, he's really, he really needs to categorize
5594280	5598760	things down. Maybe I shouldn't say web series. Cause maybe that, that people are like, Ooh,
5598760	5603160	web series. It's going to be, it's going to be a network television show.
5603160	5607160	Well, you know, it's not going to be a network television show,
5607880	5613800	HarmonQuest. So, uh, we still need to, uh, get some asses and seats. So if you want to go to
5613800	5620200	HarmonQuest.com, you can sign up more tranquilizers and you will eventually die. It's, uh, that's,
5620200	5624840	I mean, that's going to happen regardless. That's the finale. Are we having trouble selling our seats?
5624840	5629000	Have we put the link up? Oh, we're not selling them. We're giving them away. That's what I mean.
5629000	5633240	That's what we're having trouble with. There's a definite obvious, like, like the theater seats,
5633240	5640120	like 108, eight people. And like the one that's on a Saturday night, it's like there's 240 people
5640120	5643960	responded within two minutes. And then there's a couple of nights where it's like 60 and 70 people.
5643960	5647880	Well, it's not, it's better than that. We, you know, there's a couple seats left. It's not,
5647880	5653960	we're not in any danger. You guys make signals. Spencer, are you going to give us our, are you,
5653960	5658600	are you generating new characters for us? Oh yeah. I mean, will I get that someday
5658600	5666680	soon? If you, you know, come get it. I know a, I know a come on when I hear one.
5669240	5674840	So, okay. I know I missed the boat. There's, there's this, uh, there's a gentleman in this
5674840	5681240	very room who's been standing against that wall for the whole show. What, what are you doing?
5681800	5686280	You just watching the show? Yeah. Okay. That's all I wanted to know. I didn't,
5687080	5690920	I thought it would be rude to ask earlier when, uh, you know, Steve was on. Did you feel like
5690920	5696040	he was like hearing some official capacity? I thought he hated, uh, you know, sitting, uh,
5696040	5701800	New York times bestsellers or something. Yeah. No, I thought he was going to kill Steve Silverman
5703480	5710840	and I've been watching. What about the other guy? Is that Steve? That's Steve Levy. Okay. Yeah.
5710840	5715000	So you're wondering who that guy was. Yeah. Don't worry. I just feel weird for the rest of the,
5715880	5720840	I mean, it's only 20 minutes. He probably just doesn't have anywhere to sit, right?
5720840	5724600	There's plenty of places to stand. I'm not going to lie. I don't have a problem with you standing
5724600	5729400	there, but I'm going to comment on it. Now, Steve, I know you said that you're not a real,
5729400	5733240	like practicing religious Jew, but are you, uh, is there something that, is there something that you,
5733240	5738520	that we could all like do on Rosh Hashanah, like as Gentiles and goyim and whatnot? Like,
5738520	5741560	is there some fun thing that we can do to participate in your awesome new years?
5745000	5747160	I mean, is there a thing you say is you put on a hat? Do you do it?
5750360	5751640	You taught me something before.
5754200	5755400	Last year, not Toba.
5759960	5766120	We have a Jewish dissenter over here. Nope. How about close enough?
5766840	5769880	No Jews in Ireland.
5771080	5775480	Oh, Saint, Saint, Saint Goyim led them to the sea, right? With a flute.
5776520	5782200	There are some, but there's only, there's only one, uh, there's only one Jewish temple,
5782200	5784680	but while I was there, I met a lot of people that were like.
5784680	5787000	Because one synagogue or temple in all of Ireland?
5787000	5788360	Yeah. Really? Yeah.
5788360	5789160	What's that about?
5789160	5790840	Right. All of Dublin. I am.
5791320	5797480	Well, I mean, both, both rabbis and leprechauns have, like, there's competition for that corner.
5798600	5802360	Both of them, if you pour salt on their feet, they have to give up their gold, like,
5803880	5808680	and they're both just like, they'll, they'll, if you, if you say, well,
5808680	5811960	there's just a lot of the stories about leprechauns there have, they have others.
5811960	5817240	There's rabbi stories, you know, there's like, rabbi, give me your gold and any, and, and,
5818200	5822840	and then it's like, I'll, I'll tie a ribbon around the tree that has the gold under it.
5823400	5828360	And then there's like ribbon on every tree. And you're like, rabbi.
5830600	5833080	What Dan's trying to say is happy Rosh Hashanah Jews.
5836760	5839640	I could be right. There's only one temple in Dublin. I could be wrong about that.
5839640	5844600	Is that, was there like a pogrom or a persecution or there's like, Jews are like Ireland?
5845160	5850200	Well, yeah, because there's no, there's no like real, there's, there's, there's a reason for it
5850200	5853800	as to do like the industrial revolution and stuff. And just Jewish people didn't
5853800	5857240	immigrate to Ireland and also Irish people just think they're bad luck.
5857240	5858120	So they put them in a hole.
5860600	5862120	They're obsessed with luck over there.
5863800	5865320	Their dollar is backed by luck.
5867320	5870760	It's like, it's like, it's either the most ingenious or the worst decision you can ever
5870760	5875480	make. Like ours is backed by nothing. It used to be gold, but they, they converted to luck in 1938.
5878440	5883560	So if you have $2, it's worth $4 because you're clearly luckier than someone with a dollar.
5886280	5890200	And it's very complicated. And a lot of people think it's going to lead to a big crash.
5895880	5899800	Were they talking about fairies and shit over there? I hear they do that.
5900520	5903400	Oh, the Bogard came out this morning or something.
5905160	5906600	Nixie's on the port bow.
5909000	5912920	I mean, they don't, they don't talk, like when you're ordering your coffee, they're, they're not
5912920	5920040	like, let's let the, let the leaf fairy bless you today. Okay. It's not, it's not like that.
5920040	5924360	It is, it is definitely like in the background. There is like a, it does, it does feel like
5924360	5929720	genuinely magic over there. And there is like, I don't know, it is part of there. So, uh,
5929720	5935880	what am I, one of my new Dublin friends told me that when he was a kid that like he was afraid
5935880	5940360	that the, because he believed in fairies because he was a kid, uh, he believed that the fairies
5940360	5948040	would come in and climb up into his bed and like picket his face. Bed bugs. But yeah, no,
5948040	5952680	they talk about, they definitely talk about they do something they do do, which took me a little
5952680	5961880	while to get used to. All right. When I was down and I went, I busked. Do you guys know what busking
5961880	5967880	is? Yeah. But yeah, busking is street performing. And I did that in Galway a few days ago. And I
5967880	5973240	had, I had just like a Celtic drum. And in the shop when I bought, when I bought the drum,
5973240	5977640	I was, I was trying to do it. The woman was like, no, no, no, it's up and down like a paintbrush.
5977640	5981640	And I was like, okay, so I got it. Nope, nope. But you have to leave the store. You have to,
5983240	5989000	you got it. Uh, you cannot drum in here any longer. So we went out, went out on the street
5989000	5995640	and I like with the drum, uh, started out like busking. It was also illegal to busk without a
5995640	6002840	license. So pretty cool. Uh, I busked in front of Tommy Hilfiger for a little while, um, just
6002840	6012040	advertising Tommy Hilfiger. And then I, uh, this is on camera. Yeah. I was, I was, uh, both, both.
6012680	6020440	Um, but I thought it would be really funny to do, uh, do the soundtrack to Rent, um,
6021640	6025640	on the streets of Galway. So I did that until I met this man that was blowing bubbles
6026200	6030120	named Seamus. Um, and you probably met bubbles too, I guess.
6033960	6038520	We'll be right back. It'd be rude to not introduce yourself.
6038520	6045960	Uh, this is dumb. Welcome home. Seamus.
6048440	6053720	Welcome back from the Emerald Isle of lyrical wit, uh, to your shitty fat mountain of tits
6053720	6062520	boyfriend who just wants to be loved. Uh, don't we all, um, Seamus, Seamus was blowing bubbles and,
6062680	6070200	uh, I, I, I feel I needed, I felt like I needed more to my act. And so I walked up to Seamus and
6070200	6073320	asked him what he was doing and it was like, Oh, I'm blowing bubbles. I love blowing bubbles.
6074760	6079480	And I said, I, will you blow bubbles near me while I sing? And he's like,
6080760	6086200	yeah, all right. Yeah, sure, sure, sure. And so, uh, he, he picked up all, like he was blowing
6086200	6090200	just one thing of bubbles and I turned and there's a whole line against the wall and like all these
6090200	6094840	bottles of bubbles. And so I like helped him get his bubbles together. And the moment that I was
6094840	6100040	like, Oh, Seamus, like, I don't know why I didn't assume this. So Seamus, Seamus isn't neurotypical.
6100840	6108120	Um, as he, he was like polishing his bubbles and I'm not, uh, I'm not diagnosing him as autistic,
6108120	6114120	but, uh, obviously it's not. Anyway, he picked up all his bubbles and, or not obviously, why am I,
6114120	6118040	fuck me. Okay. So I picked up all the bubbles, helped him with the bubbles and, and we started
6118040	6122520	singing and we're, I'm, I was singing. I was just like improvising about people that were
6122520	6127800	walking by and these kids were watching me and, and these kids were eating their gelato and like
6127800	6132520	laughing. And I was like, like teasing these kids and he stops blowing the bubbles and he says,
6132520	6139560	have you ever had sex? The bubble, bubble guy? Yeah, Seamus, yeah. Seamus, Seamus stopped blowing
6139560	6143080	bubbles. Oh no, he was still blowing bubbles. So you were the kid. To me, to me, to me, to me.
6143080	6148280	And the kids are, the kids are, are pretty. How old is Seamus? Seamus is probably
6148280	6153640	late fifties, early sixties. How old are the kids? Uh, they were right in the sweet spot.
6154680	6162120	They were good to go, Demarge. Yeah. In your parlance. He didn't, he didn't see the kids. Also,
6162120	6166040	Seamus didn't, I told Seamus, I said that, you know, we're going to be filming this. It's for
6166040	6171720	this silly travel thing. So that's what those guys are doing with like this big camera and this boom
6171720	6176840	mic. And he was like, had no, did not care. And, uh, the kids were far away and he turns to me and
6176840	6185000	says, have you had sex? And I was like, Seamus, um, for shame. Uh, I, I said, I, uh, Seamus,
6185000	6188440	I don't, I don't want to have that conversation with you. And he said, ah, hi, had sex once
6188440	6194760	40 years ago. And he's saying this as he's like blowing bubbles. And I look over at the guys who
6194760	6200680	are filming and they can hear everything and they're giving me the like you cool face. Um, or in
6200680	6208280	Ireland, you, you grand. Um, so, uh, he, he then, he then said, uh, I had sex 40 years ago with a
6208280	6213160	woman and she was the only lady I ever had sex with. And she, uh, she died last year, probably
6213160	6222120	cause she was so fat. And I was just continuing to blow bubbles as I'm like lady in a blouse.
6225960	6229720	What did he, and then he, and then he said, you know, they don't talk about AIDS anymore,
6229720	6243160	do they? Don't bury the lead Seamus. Uh, no, I, I think they still talk about AIDS. He's like,
6243160	6248200	no, no, no, they don't talk about it no more. They don't talk about AIDS no more. Uh, and I said,
6248200	6254360	do I know someone with AIDS and he just continued to blow his bubbles. Um, and, uh, the saddest
6254360	6258680	thing was that we put out a hat to make money. And, uh, because I'm a brilliant businesswoman,
6258680	6266200	put money in the hat myself. So people would be like, whoa, this must be good. Uh, yeah. Yeah.
6266200	6271720	Yeah. Uh, we made, I made a deal with Seamus that like we could split whatever we made
6271720	6278920	and we made a nothing. Um, so I took out, I took out 20 Euro, like a, like a cash 20 Euro and handed
6278920	6283080	him to handed it to him. And I was like, here you go. He was like, we made this, we made this today.
6283080	6288760	And I was like, yeah, yeah, we made this, made this 20 Euro. Uh, and I gave it to him from the
6288760	6295960	AIDS talk Seamus. And we, as I walked away from him, um, and I was walking with my friends who
6295960	6300600	we had to, we were leaving to go to a gail talk, which is like a village where they only speak
6300600	6306120	Irish. And I just started crying and it was like, I, I just, I feel so awful. And they're like, yes,
6306120	6311880	too. Like, let's just take a walk. That's the end of that sad story. What made you feel awful?
6311880	6321080	Yeah. Um, well, I, it, it just, I don't know. It just felt, it just kind of hit me with it. I don't
6321080	6325400	know. I just, it just felt really dark. Also when I was busking, you know what it also was that like
6325400	6329960	at a certain point, I thought it would be funny to just list all my insecurities as like seeing all
6329960	6335960	my insecurities. And I felt like I was kind of exploiting myself a little bit. Um, I don't know.
6335960	6345000	Do you guys ever feel that way? It's called Harmon town. Um, but you just wanted to like,
6345000	6351800	you, you mean because he was sort of, uh, touched and, uh, in multiple senses and you wanted to like,
6352440	6357480	it was like a dark glimpse, like the guy that painted the, our house, the, the guy with the
6357480	6363720	headphones. Uh, yeah. Like I started crying about that. Uh, well, you know, I never met him. Right.
6363720	6367400	You know, I never felt bad for it. Like we didn't feel bad for Seamus because Seamus,
6367400	6373320	I think, I think it was the juxtaposition of like me, uh, feeling, because I was listing all these
6373320	6378280	things that I was insecure about and worried about. So it made me like really think about those things
6378280	6384520	just juxtaposed with Seamus who, who not only does he blow up bubbles all the time, he is always
6384520	6389400	like, ah, they're just so beautiful. The bubbles, look at all the bubbles and all look at this bubble
6389400	6393160	and that bubble. And then, uh, there were a couple of times when I was joke, I was, and I was doing
6393160	6397240	this for the camera, like when he would slow down a little bit and I would be like, Seamus, come on,
6397240	6402360	come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. And he was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And then sometimes he
6402360	6407240	would accidentally blow them in my face. But like he was, he was like, he was, he was happy. He was a
6407240	6412440	happy person. And then I was like, you know, I'm beating my drum and like demanding the world to
6412440	6417320	tell me I'm okay. And I was like, what's wrong with me? That was, that was why I felt sad. But it was
6417320	6425320	great. It was great fun. I also, uh, it was real good. I also went, I took, I was brought up mostly
6425320	6430120	in Southern California. So obviously my first time taking surf lessons was in Ireland. That's crazy
6430120	6436280	that you went surfing. Yeah. Yeah. With, with, uh, with Alan, the surf instructor who was very nice.
6436840	6441160	And I'm sorry, Danny was very handsome, but he was very short. I wish some of these people were women.
6441160	6451240	It would make sense because they're half the population. I don't understand why everyone in
6451240	6457560	Ireland's a guy that all wants to teach you something. Right, right, right. Well, in these
6457560	6462920	stories, I, uh, I met, I met all these people through, uh, these wonderful female comedians
6462920	6470680	in Dublin, um, Alison Spittle and Andrea Farrell. And so they, yeah, there were plenty, there were
6470680	6477240	plenty of women hanging out with a lot of women. Just no handsome ones. Just no handsome women.
6477880	6484360	I don't really understand your joke. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. He's just connecting dots, man.
6486120	6489800	Should we play a tiny bit of Shadowrun before we, uh, before we fuck up? Let's do it.
6489800	6496520	Jury's out on jelly babies. Did it taste like jelly bears? Not those gummy bears. No, they're
6496520	6501240	not like gummy bears at all. They're shaped exactly like them, but they're, uh, they're, uh,
6501240	6505640	no, they're very chewy. Like, I mean, not chewy, not as chewy as gummy bears. I mean,
6505640	6509880	they're not good. They're like, you just eat them like, uh, I'm just noticing that like they're
6509880	6516360	really, they're naked except for their shoes. Look at the cover of creepy. Yeah. And they're,
6516360	6521960	they're all kind of humping something. Also something that distinguishes them from gummy
6521960	6526840	bears is that their flavors are very distinct. Look, the, uh, yellow ones taste yellow and the,
6526840	6532200	and the, and the dark ones are gross. They're like licorice. Yeah. Yeah.
6536840	6539720	It's just interesting to know that that's what Dr. Who was eating the whole time.
6540520	6543880	Dr. Who eats jelly babies. Oh, it does? Yeah. Cool.
6546280	6549800	I think I can smell your jelly babies from here. Are they, are they kind of citrusy or like,
6550200	6554200	free flavor? Do you want to try a jelly? No, I don't like, I'm not a really like a jelly gummy.
6554200	6561080	I like to smell your jelly babies. I'm going to go blow bubbles. I want to watch you blow bubbles
6561080	6567160	when I smell your jelly babies. Let's, let's play a brief Shadow Run, shall we? Just to,
6567160	6572840	just to tie a nice little bow on this thing. Yeah. We got, we got the, we got a, we got
6572840	6576440	enough of a crew up here. Yep. Demarj, anything on your mind? What do you got going on?
6577400	6582440	He's just a puddle. I think it's a green jelly. What do you think about that? What's your,
6582440	6586200	what's your verdict on jelly babies? They tasted green. I had to, they tasted green and I looked
6587000	6594760	and it was green. Demarj is a simple man. That and 90 thoughts about soccer. That's all that's
6594760	6605080	going on right now. I went hurling. Oh geez. I learned hurling. I played hurling. How'd you do?
6605640	6610200	Um, well, hurling, hurling, which is. Everyone I know that from Ireland has a big scar on their
6610200	6615880	face because like you give a bunch of kids sticks wrapped in sheet metal and stuff like that.
6615880	6621160	The most complex set of tasks to do. Yeah. You have to carry, you have to carry the, the,
6621160	6626360	the spiff or the ball on the stick, like an egg. And then you have to hit it into a net. It's like
6626360	6630280	a combination of football and rugby. And it's weird, but I played it with a bunch of eight
6630280	6636920	year old boys. Um, meow. Why do I keep on making a pedophile jokes? Um, oh, I made a joke about
6636920	6641880	pedophilia at the surf thing, which caused a lot of problems. And they kept on calling the guy that
6641880	6647960	was produced the guy with the penis that was producing my show. Uh, and just demanding that
6647960	6654280	it not be in the show. Anyway, who did the surf instructor? And I wasn't even making a joke about
6654280	6657800	them or anything. And it wasn't even on camera, but it wasn't even their joke. Why are they,
6657800	6662120	why do they have? They didn't want pedophile, like pedophilia associated with the surf school.
6662120	6666680	And they did it so much that I was like, I feel like, I think that's fair. Well, no, it is fair,
6666680	6671640	but we were like, we're weren't even filming. It's fair to not want pedophilia associated with
6671640	6675800	microscopes. But if the owner of a microscope company was that insistent about it, I'd start
6675800	6686280	investigating them. Let's put you on a slide and look for pedophilia. Yeah. And he'd be like,
6686360	6690200	this is exactly what I didn't want. And I go, yeah. But they were getting that impression.
6690200	6694840	He runs a school. There's children that come and take surf lessons. He can't get,
6694840	6699320	he can't be making pedophile jokes. Is that surfing in children? That's a big thing. He's
6699320	6704120	in schools are for children, man. Yeah. I actually don't want to talk anymore about it because I
6704120	6708920	promised him I wouldn't talk anymore. We didn't promise him anything.
6709640	6714920	What was the name? It sounds like a pedophile to me. It's tiny, tiny touches, full hearts.
6718760	6723880	Sounds like this guy wants to hang 10 years old. It's called our little,
6723880	6729560	it's called our little secret surf school. Cowabung hole. It's called,
6729560	6734760	it's called, no one will believe you.
6738520	6741000	I'm doing dumb puns, but you're going really dark.
6742520	6746360	It's called doesn't this make you feel special? I chose you surf school.
6746360	6757960	The surf isn't all that's up. My, my, my hard dick.
6760040	6761560	And the reason it's hard is because you're young.
6763720	6764280	Surf school.
6770440	6773560	We don't have to play shadow. We can just do 10 more minutes of this. That'd be quite heavy.
6776360	6781160	Just take off your shirt. There's no time for shadow right now. Let's just ride this
6781160	6792280	metaphorical wave into the one of their slogans could be, uh, now students now 20% less likely
6792280	6799960	to die by shark attack because, um, the, uh, relative to the ways that they're likely to die
6800680	6808120	from coming to our surf school. Because, because the other ways are spiking, which include
6808120	6814840	disappearance, uh, wave goodbye to healthy sex in your adulthood surf school.
6819240	6820440	My shadow run. I'm kidding.
6823160	6827800	The least, the least lucky place in Ireland. Was there somebody else that we wanted to,
6828520	6834200	was there any other business we had? No, that's not happening. I got the date wrong on that. Okay.
6834200	6838360	All right. We had a little secret surprise, but we're doing it another time.
6839880	6842920	Yeah. It was at Dan and I announcing my new surf school.
6846680	6850600	Brought to you by jelly. Dan Spencer and I and Demarge have been working on an all nude
6850600	6854680	review for you guys and it's going to have to wait another week. Why am I not on it? Because
6854680	6860680	you're out of town. Oh, okay. Fine. You know what? Okay. So a couple of things to warn you about
6860680	6867000	Nigel puked on the duvet. Like, and I, there's not another one. Did you clean it up?
6868040	6876280	Yeah. Yeah. But you know, he, it's puke. It's not permanent.
6878200	6883160	It's puke. Did you not clean it up? Really? I cleaned, I took toilet paper and I cleaned it
6883160	6891960	up. Did you spray it with anything? No. Is this still on the bed? Did you sit on the floor?
6894600	6899720	And then there's also like, well, just, I mean, I would just be prepared. I feel like Harvey,
6899720	6905880	when he, when you get, when you walk in the door, I would like to videotape it. The dog seeing you
6905880	6914520	again, I feel like Harvey may pee, like he may pee because he's been peeing like emotionally.
6914520	6918680	He peed all over. I came over and he laid on his back and just lisped arced a beautiful little
6918680	6923080	rainbow of pee all over my shoe. I think part of that was the steroids from his ear infection
6923080	6930680	medication. Also the cat's dying. Welcome home. She's, she has, she's on three different types
6930680	6936200	of medication and one of them is a bag of fluid that I've probably told you about because I've
6937000	6942840	owned cats before and they're, once their kidneys start going. So now we're one of those families,
6942840	6948440	we're going to have to hang a bag of and do the subcutaneous injection and defib and
6950040	6956040	Steve, do you think it's too late to book another flight back to, oh, I'm just kidding. I was like,
6956040	6962760	oh God. It'll, it'll be grand. It'll be grand. On a positive note, Dan informed
6962760	6973560	us, the audience tonight that he'd taken his first shower since you've been gone today.
6973560	6985320	Well, at least you dressed up for me. Really? The first shower? Why would, why would I?
6986920	6992280	It's fine. It's your own, it's your own life. It's your own body. It's a life I share with you.
6992840	6999880	What? It's a life. Come on, fuck you. What? The first shower in like two months, guys.
6999880	7003000	That's crazy. No, but it's fine. It's your own, it's your own business.
7005640	7012440	That's a, this is going great. Seems like you cheated on me in Ireland. It's like, well,
7013080	7021320	with showers, with so many showers, with so many showers and babs. Um, well,
7023240	7026760	Dan, did you cheat on Aaron with video games? Yeah.
7029880	7040600	I loved them. I cheated on you with, uh, myself with some, with some, some good self discovery.
7040600	7047880	I spent a lot of time. I did masturbate. Someone was giggling. I did. Did you bring some tingle
7047880	7052840	sticks along? Some tingle sticks. What are tingle sticks? Cattle prods. Here we go.
7052840	7062120	Oh, I see, I see. No, no, no. Um, I, I, I had agreed times, but a lot of time I myself
7062120	7068200	realized that I'm okay. It's all good. I did a play, did a lot of stuff. You seem a little unhappy.
7069080	7076120	I mean, I just got off of a 14 hour flight. Were you first class? I was first class and
7076120	7085320	I flew first class. What airline? I feel like we're just, uh, I, uh, British, British airwaves,
7085320	7093000	which is very nice. Yeah. Very nice. Through, uh, American frequent fire miles. Damn. Well,
7093000	7096520	tomorrow, you didn't want to get to talk to you much tonight. Do you have any final thoughts for
7096520	7101000	us to merge? No, man. I, you know what? The biggest thing that happened is it doesn't compare
7101000	7107560	to any of this is that I spent a couple of hours, uh, uh, going on a rant about academy,
7107560	7111960	academyized poetry. And, and, you know, I had a friend who was saying, you know, I,
7111960	7117560	I'm getting into it on my own and there's no place to, to find it. Uh, and I had to my his poetry.
7117560	7124120	Yeah. Just poetry. That is, I mean, right now, speaking of masturbating up here, dude,
7124120	7133880	it's a sexual organ. You know, we've lost track of, we lost track of poetry, maybe 25, 30 years
7133880	7138440	ago. Um, we don't even know who, we don't even know the definition of American young, the younger
7138440	7145320	American poets. No, but I ran, I ran the writing program in college and I ran the writing journal
7145320	7150360	with, uh, a couple of friends of mine. Uh, and, and I just, and it's just, so you get in that
7150360	7154840	habit of just following and keeping up with who are, who the new younger American poets are.
7156200	7161640	And, uh, so it wasn't an angry rant. It was just saying to my friend, there are these places
7161640	7165640	in town all over the place and they're free and it's frequent and it's often,
7165640	7172840	and his face lit up because he generally was, uh, uh, reading on his own and loving what he was
7172840	7177560	reading and had discovered how to read a book of poetry, which we don't even teach kids anymore.
7177560	7181400	We don't teach them how poets come up with a book and what that means about their lives.
7181400	7186200	The same way an album comes together. Uh, in a lot of cases, it's just as exciting. Um,
7186840	7191880	impossible to convince you of that right now, but, uh, if you know it, it's true and you spend
7191880	7195880	a lifetime developing that and stacking it up on top of itself and stuff. So there was like
7195880	7199720	a rant, uh, that I won. This is in between me screaming about the jets kicking a Cleveland
7199720	7206680	Brown's ass. Hey, it happened. Our quarterback has a broken jaw. The second string guy destroyed
7206680	7215400	you guys. The defense looks amazing. Our coach is a genius. Suck it. Suck it. That was a haiku.
7215400	7221400	No sports, no sports, no sports, definitely no sports, no sports sports, sports suck. Definitely
7221400	7228920	sports suck. And just, and then just the shit show that is Arsenal and our French coach sitting in
7228920	7233400	interviews and just going, well, we had a certain quality and the players for, uh, they were good
7233400	7238200	today and the boys did whatever they did. These are the things that, that I, uh, I'm single guys.
7238200	7241160	I was hoping someone would yell no in response to that.
7243960	7250120	You know, if you zip your, uh, dick into, uh, a swimsuit, which by the way,
7250120	7255880	don't get a swimsuit with a zipper in the ocean sharks will come.
7255880	7262520	Cliffhanger. Thank you for coming, everybody. Welcome back Aaron McGathey.
