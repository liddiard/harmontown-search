0	3000	Howdy, y'all!
10000	12000	Dave Cline's in the house.
12000	14000	Church is in the house.
16000	18000	Hello, everybody. I'm Jeff Davis.
18000	21000	I'm the Comptroller of Carment Town from downtown.
23000	27000	From the prestigious heroin and get stabbed district of Los Angeles.
27000	29000	Carment Town is now in session.
29000	33000	Let's bring out our Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crichton.
41000	42000	Hello, Spencer.
42000	43000	What's up?
43000	44000	What it is, man.
44000	45000	I got the couch back.
45000	52000	You're wearing your iconic lumberjackie kind of classic wardrobe.
54000	56000	Let's bring out your mayor. His name.
56000	60000	His name is Daniel Anastasia Harmon.
66000	67000	Damn.
69000	72000	Living in the city
73000	76000	Is it easy for a child
77000	80000	Trying to reach the sunlight
80000	83000	Even though your spirits wild
83000	85000	Living in the city
85000	86000	Damn.
86000	87000	Should be
88000	89000	Should be
90000	92000	Pretty easy to reach sunlight
92000	93000	If you're wild
93000	95000	Oh, I didn't know
95000	97000	I had a note session
97000	99000	With a fellow person
99000	101000	Singing a song
101000	103000	Living in the city
103000	105000	Fields Tripe
105000	107000	What does that even mean?
107000	109000	Fields Tripe
109000	112000	That's just a thing that high school teachers write
112000	114000	I'm your essay
115000	116000	Damn.
116000	118000	This feels overwrought
119000	121000	I'm seventeen
122000	125000	It's a creative writing class
125000	128000	I should be overwrought
128000	131000	I don't know how to take that note
131000	133000	It sounds like over-ready
135000	136000	Hello, Dan.
136000	137000	How's it going?
137000	140000	Compared to these days, which I imagine like you kids
140000	142000	You probably didn't have a school paper
142000	144000	You probably have like a school text
144000	146000	A school emoji
147000	148000	They were like
148000	149000	They had a school
149000	151000	We're gonna send out the school emoji
152000	154000	You fucking robots
154000	156000	I'm not blaming you
156000	157000	I feel bad for you
157000	159000	I didn't make my school paper
159000	160000	But I had one
160000	162000	And we had like deadlines
162000	163000	You didn't work on your school paper?
163000	166000	I would assume that you would have been like editor-in-chief
166000	167000	Of your school paper
167000	168000	Look, make no mistake
168000	170000	This is top shit
170000	172000	In terms of creating the content
172000	174000	That's not true
174000	176000	No, there were better workers
176000	177000	Harder workers
177000	178000	And there were people more respected
178000	179000	There were better poets
179000	181000	There were better writers
181000	183000	But I loved working on the school paper
183000	185000	I just wanted glory
185000	189000	I had a serialized Spencer
189000	190000	Hell yes
190000	191000	This will wake you up
191000	192000	Serial?
192000	193000	I'm awake
193000	195000	I'm just behind everyone else
195000	197000	A new way of saying hi
199000	200000	Um
201000	203000	Didn't get that big a laugh
203000	206000	I'm not feeling good vibes tonight
208000	211000	Them not laughing at that made it seem like I was shaming you
211000	214000	I'm proud of you being high
214000	215000	Oh yeah, me too
215000	216000	No, I'm loving it
216000	219000	I'm just not on my game
219000	220000	I love how high you are
220000	221000	Yeah, see
221000	222000	Proud of you son
222000	223000	Oh yeah
223000	226000	I was in Boston where I didn't smoke much
226000	228000	Every time I come back from a trip
228000	230000	That's the highest I've ever been
230000	231000	It's the best
231000	232000	Why were you in Boston?
232000	234000	There's this thing called PAX
234000	236000	I guess there's a bunch of them
236000	238000	There's ones closer apparently
238000	241000	But I went to the one in Boston
241000	242000	You play games
242000	245000	Oh, were you DMing?
245000	246000	No, no
246000	247000	I should have
247000	249000	If I had any forethought at all
249000	252000	It would have been insane
252000	254000	How is a PAX compared to a Gen Con?
254000	255000	I've never been to Gen Con
255000	256000	I want to do that too
256000	257000	But I don't know
257000	258000	It was just weird though
258000	259000	I've never been to anything
259000	261000	Because it was kind of like Comic Con
261000	262000	Just with a convention floor
262000	264000	But then a good third of the space
264000	266000	Was just like long tables and chairs
266000	267000	That were just full of people
267000	269000	Playing fucking board games
269000	270000	And games and shit
270000	271000	It was crazy
271000	273000	There was so much game playing
273000	274000	I've just never seen
274000	275000	I mean there's all these cons
275000	276000	We've been on it
276000	278000	It's like check out what's on Fox
278000	280000	And then it's like the cosplay brigade
280000	281000	Or whatever
281000	282000	But it's all this thing
282000	283000	You know it's all just kind of like
283000	285000	This weird artifice or marketing
285000	287000	Or whatever
287000	290000	But this is just people doing games
290000	291000	It was interesting
291000	293000	When I was your age
295000	299000	Ulysses S. Grant was President of the United States
300000	301000	Blood was invented
301000	302000	Fair enough
303000	304000	I remember Comic Con
304000	305000	We would go to Comic Con
305000	306000	And it would be like
306000	308000	Because we were working in comic books
308000	309000	And it would be like
309000	310000	Oh, we're here to sign a comic book
310000	311000	And then you'd walk around
311000	312000	And be like
312000	314000	God damn, this place has a lot of people selling comic books
314000	315000	Right
315000	316000	And then there was also people who were like
316000	318000	Well, guys are walking around
318000	319000	Buying comic books
319000	320000	Maybe you'd like a sword
320000	321000	And the answer is
321000	322000	That's fair
322000	323000	Yeah
323000	324000	There was a dude
324000	325000	Lots of people want swords
325000	326000	But also by comic books
326000	327000	It makes sense
327000	330000	In Inglewood that had a sword
330000	333000	In a Scientology church
334000	337000	And he got killed by police
337000	340000	Because I think he fucked up a couple of cops with a sword
340000	341000	Oh, yeah
341000	343000	In a Scientology church
343000	344000	Is that what you call them?
344000	345000	Uh-huh
345000	346000	And it's like
347000	349000	Inglewood's fucked up for a lot of reasons
349000	353000	But if you're going to fucking have a sword thrown down
353000	356000	I like that it was a Scientology venue
356000	358000	Because you're able to just be objective
358000	360000	And you don't have to root for either side
360000	361000	You're like
361000	363000	Oh, I hope the police learn their lesson
363000	365000	Along with Xenu
365000	368000	I will stab your thetans
368000	369000	I don't know how it works
369000	370000	I know the word sword
370000	372000	I mean, I'm already three tangents deep
372000	374000	But I can't have you doing that
374000	375000	What?
375000	376000	You're sober
376000	377000	I guess I can
377000	378000	It's fine
378000	379000	There's no guess
379000	380000	There's no guess
380000	381000	This is it
381000	382000	This is the show
382000	383000	I brought it up
383000	384000	No, it's okay
384000	385000	It's all right
385000	386000	It was a very spurious connection, I think
386000	387000	Is the critique
387000	388000	I was like
388000	389000	Based on something Spencer was saying
389000	390000	About this convention
390000	391000	Where it's like
391000	392000	Oh, it's just gaming
392000	393000	People play games
393000	394000	And I was like
394000	395000	I remember from the old days
395000	396000	The early 90s
396000	397000	Like 93, 95
397000	399000	And selling and buying comic books
399000	400000	Out of big boxes
400000	401000	And everyone was just like
401000	402000	It's just Comic-Con
402000	405000	And yeah, there was a ton of shit that wasn't comics
405000	407000	I'm not gonna be an old timer
407000	408000	That like pretends
408000	409000	And you know
409000	410000	There's nothing but comic books
410000	411000	I was like
411000	412000	No, it was a bunch of swords
412000	415000	And like
415000	417000	But I remember when it was like
417000	419000	That central area of the exhibit floor
419000	420000	Like the day that it was like
420000	423000	The PlayStation 1
423000	424000	Like kind of like
424000	426000	Oh, what the fuck is going on
426000	428000	In the middle of this fucking
428000	430000	Why the hell are we having to walk around this
430000	431000	I was like
431000	433000	Well, some video game decided that
433000	436000	Because technically we're all nerds
436000	439000	That maybe we'd be interested in Papa the Rappa
439000	441000	Like coming out on fucking Xbox or something
441000	442000	And it was like
442000	443000	Like it just started
443000	444000	And it was like
444000	445000	Along with that
445000	446000	It was like everyone was like
446000	447000	What the fuck
447000	448000	Was that Bruce Willis?
448000	449000	What the fuck's going on
449000	450000	Yeah, hey
450000	451000	And then with that comes like
451000	452000	Hey, stop sitting on the floor
452000	453000	Fatty
453000	455000	Well, I got a bunch of comic books
455000	456000	Ah, bet you do
456000	460000	You know who's got more comic books than you?
460000	461000	Bruce Willis
461000	463000	You fucking sit on the floor in front of him
463000	465000	I'm going to fucking mace your ass
465000	467000	That conversation never happened
467000	468000	No, those guys
468000	469000	The guys are bad
469000	471000	Those staff guys at Comic Con are bad
471000	473000	At PAX they were like volunteers
473000	475000	And they were actually really good at their jobs
475000	479000	They were very like contextual
479000	480000	With their enforcements
480000	482000	But just so that both sides are represented
482000	483000	Uh oh
483000	484000	I'm a big both side-ist
484000	485000	Uh oh
485000	486000	Uh
486000	487000	When we were at WonderCon
487000	489000	That was a real like
489000	491000	All the security there was volunteer
491000	493000	Which is why a guy came up to talk about Deadpool
493000	496000	And his friend came up to punch him in the face
496000	498000	And then we were paid in an envelope of cash
498000	500000	And whisked back to the hotel
500000	501000	Those were bad volunteers
501000	503000	And I will never go back to Florida again
503000	505000	I know, that really shattered everybody
505000	506000	And I want to know about Florida
506000	508000	I will watch Flaca videos
508000	509000	That was a show that I was not
509000	510000	You want that Flaca
510000	511000	But you are?
511000	512000	Go out
512000	513000	I was not at that show
513000	520600	I was not at that show. I wonder how that would have gone down if I had interfered in that, like, interference loop.
520600	522720	I bet you would have caught his punch.
522720	526680	No, I wouldn't, because I'm not a martial artist. I just...
526680	527400	No, you wouldn't.
527400	531640	I just think I would have made the person feel bad before they started throwing punches at people.
531640	535080	The guy who did not take a survey...
535080	536280	It was all very fast.
536280	541040	The guy walked up and punched his friend in the face.
541040	546080	The thing is, it looked like he was going to grab a mic until the very last second,
546080	549520	which is a semi-precedent phenomenon, unfortunately.
549520	551680	And he punched his friend.
551680	552720	His alleged friend.
552720	554880	Well, we found out later that they were friends.
554880	556400	Was that a setup?
556400	558000	It may have been.
558000	560400	What's the difference when you're 22? Everything's a joke.
561040	562000	Nothing's a joke.
562000	562800	Like, everything's...
562800	564000	You're Tyler Durden.
564000	567680	You're Robert Edwards, or whatever the Hulk's name is.
568480	569520	Bruce Banner?
569520	571360	Ed Norton.
571360	571920	Ed Norton.
575920	576880	You're Robert Evans.
578080	580320	Your kid's in the picture. Your kid's out of the picture.
581200	582240	The kid's the Hulk.
582240	584720	It doesn't matter to them. They're 22.
584720	587120	What's the difference between life and death? You're 22.
587120	589680	Here was what I did when I was 22.
589680	597520	I spent five years doing nothing but smoking weed out of a bong I made out of a syrup bottle.
598000	601120	It was fucking melted plastic I was smoking.
601120	603120	Like, I wasn't even smoking weed.
603920	605360	I tested that theory.
605360	607360	I was like, well, maybe just a placebo.
607360	613120	Yeah, or you've been huffing fucking burnt plastic for five years.
613840	619040	Like, Cheryl Crow thinks she got cancer from the water bottles in the back seat of her car.
619040	620000	Like, it's a real thing.
620000	623120	Like, the idea of just water soaking in plastic, let alone heated...
623760	628240	I'm, you know, this is why I can't remember Ed Norton's name.
629760	632080	It's not Ed Norton. That's from Honeymooners.
633360	634640	It's Robert Evans.
634640	637360	Ed Norton is the Hulk of the Fight Club.
637360	640400	It's Bixby. Bixby is the Hulk guy.
640400	642160	Well, yes, Bill Bixby played the Hulk.
642160	646000	Bill Bixby played the name of the character.
646000	647440	Ed Norton, you know.
647440	648480	It's not Ed Norton.
648480	650000	That's the actor of the new Hulk.
650000	652880	The actor. He played the Hulk in one of the nine Hulk movies.
653840	657440	The Angry One, where the Hulk appears on page 71.
657440	658240	No.
658240	658720	Wait, what?
661200	661840	Wait, say what?
661840	665440	Oh, no. Ed Norton made the punk rock response.
665440	666800	He was like, yeah, no, come on.
666800	668560	I'm not making that fucking shit.
669840	670800	The Hulk speaks to me.
670800	673120	It's about fucking trying to manage your fucking anger.
674640	675600	I'm not mocking him.
676560	678640	It sounds a lot like I am.
678640	679600	It was good.
679600	680160	No, no.
681120	682240	Mark Ruffalo, right?
683600	684880	He beats the Hulk.
684880	686880	No, no, no. Who was in the Ang Lee one?
687920	688800	Eric Bana.
689920	691200	Ang Lee, Eric Bana.
691920	694000	Josh Whedon cracked the code.
694000	695280	Don't make Hulk movies.
695280	698880	Josh Whedon said, he's like, you can't make a Hulk movie.
698880	702960	The Hulk is a Marvel character that hates the one thing the audience loves.
703760	704720	The Thor isn't like that.
704720	706800	He's like, don't get that fucking hammer away from me.
708080	710560	Unfortunately, the Hulk is just the closest thing
710560	712960	you're going to get to a DC character in the Marvel universe.
713200	715600	He's just like, dude, you can do anything but doesn't want to.
715600	718000	Who is the actor that played the 70s or 80s Hulk?
719040	719680	Bill Bixby.
719680	720480	Bill Bixby, yeah.
720480	722640	Well, no, Lou Frigno was the Hulk, but who?
722640	726160	Bill Bixby was the non-Hulk-y version of that character.
726160	726800	Fantastic.
726800	728880	I wish, I really wish Bill Bixby...
729600	731920	Well, I mean, if he was... Bill Bixby's fucking great.
731920	734080	Watch my favorite Martian, young Bill Bixby.
734080	736080	He'd Hulk out and his pants would fly off.
737040	739200	And then all of a sudden he had a rope belt.
739200	740240	Where did that rope come from?
740960	743120	He had an endless supply of rope, but not...
743120	746400	It came from a satisfied audience in the Academy of Television Sciences
746400	751280	because that show won an Emmy for best dramatic series on television.
751920	754640	The Hulk, where they would regularly,
754640	758000	if they had to show a close-up of the Hulk's foot mashing a gas pedal,
758000	761200	as it sometimes did, because sometimes the Hulk
761200	764000	did need to angrily drive a car.
764960	766880	And they would show a close-up of his foot
766880	770960	and it would be Lou Ferrigno's foot with a little green panty hose on it.
770960	772480	Like a little spandex.
772480	777200	But also, the pants were torn in a way that a pirate's pants are torn.
777200	778480	They weren't torn in regular...
779600	781920	Oh, my leg got three times bigger.
781920	784080	They were torn in a weird art department kind of way.
784080	785520	But it was amazing. I was watching a Hulk rerun
785520	787040	and they showed the Hulk went,
788160	789760	and jammed his foot.
789760	790560	And you could tell, it was like,
790560	792160	okay, so what are we going to cut to in the edit bay?
792160	793920	And the answer is usually like a second unit.
793920	795680	Like, if you can bank this stuff.
795680	797680	They're like, well, yeah, we sent out the crew
797680	800880	and we shot one of the stunt guys or whatever.
800880	802400	We shot their foot going through the thing.
802400	804160	And it was like, the guys, whoever it is,
804160	807360	they're wearing a thing that would make sense for them to wear
807360	808960	instead of spray painting their feet green
808960	811520	if they're doing shots of them leaping over fences or whatever.
811520	814400	But they're wearing a green sock on their foot.
814960	817600	And it's not like, I mean, in this world of CG,
817600	820240	you probably don't even understand what I'm really saying.
820240	825120	It's just like green tights on your foot, so there's no toes.
825360	828480	And they do like a close-up of, and it's like,
828480	830320	and then some editor was like, yeah,
830320	832160	I'll use it, and the executive producer was like,
832160	833840	what are you doing, a sock commercial?
833840	835680	And he's like, no, this is your show about the Hulk.
837120	841440	And the EP was like, okay, well, what do we do after this?
841440	842880	It goes into the Smithsonian.
842880	845120	No, it goes on television for an hour.
846160	848160	They're like, oh, are you sure people aren't going to,
848160	849600	dude, there's no, what do you think?
849600	851120	People are going to record it?
852400	854560	People aren't going to watch it over and over again.
854560	857760	75% of the human beings that love your show
857760	860240	and gave you an Emmy are never going to see that foot.
860800	862960	They're going to be making a sandwich.
862960	864640	They're going to be yelling at their daughter
864640	867120	for joining the occult.
867120	867760	The MRA.
869360	872960	And like none of them knew, the VCR hadn't been invented.
872960	874320	So like back then, you'd just be like,
874320	876800	well, it's just going out of the airwaves.
876800	878080	Which means it's like going,
878080	879920	it's like pissing it out of your dick.
880640	885840	But also watching old TV on high-def television,
885840	889040	like a great digital TV changes everything.
889040	890000	When it's remastered,
890000	892800	like if they would shoot Night Rider on film
892800	895520	and then it got broadcast,
895520	898320	some of these old shows, like they shoot it on film
898320	901440	and then if they kept the shit or whatever,
901440	903920	it's like they'll do like Night Rider on Blu-ray.
903920	905920	You can like watch the thing and you're like,
905920	908160	now you're seeing shit that not only,
908160	910800	but I'm just saying even before high-def,
910800	911600	where you're like, oh,
911600	914480	they didn't know Wonder Woman's like wig would look like,
914480	916000	they didn't know we could see that makeup
916000	917440	because they didn't have high-def.
917440	921280	But I'm saying even like they also didn't understand
921280	923440	the high-def that is,
923440	927280	we would all have all media permanently stored forever.
927280	929280	They didn't, like how would you think that?
929280	930320	It wasn't momentary.
930320	931520	They were just like, well, what we do is
931520	934160	we like throw these candies at a parade.
934160	936400	And I'm not imputing them at all.
937360	938480	They took great pride in it,
938480	940480	but they thought that their job was like,
940480	942800	they've spent more time going like,
942800	945360	when you throw candy, don't hit a kid in the eye.
945360	946560	Don't let them choke.
946560	948000	You know, like don't throw it to a kid
948000	950240	who looks like his epiglottis might be malformed.
950240	952880	Like they were focused more on different shit
952880	954160	because it was of the moment.
954160	955600	And now we live in this world where it's like,
955600	958160	every candy is like beamed into their brain by Venmo
958160	959120	and they have it forever.
959120	961200	So keep in mind that five years from now,
961200	962880	you might be committing a felony.
963120	965680	Do you remember when the Harlem Globetrotters
965680	967280	made it to Gilligan's Island?
967280	970480	Yeah, they finally made it.
970480	976480	But also, also, fucking, also, they got off the island,
976480	978080	like in the same episode.
978080	979200	Everybody does.
979200	982240	How come the cast can't be smarter
982240	985280	than the Harlem Globetrotters and make a boat?
985280	987920	These are old questions, Jeff.
988720	990160	Everybody wonders that.
991120	993600	Let's do a segment called Old TV Questions.
994160	995440	Oh, yeah.
995440	997520	Who's got an old TV question for your friend?
997520	998640	Me, don't ask them.
999760	1002480	I have 800,000 questions about Fantasy Island.
1003520	1004000	Yeah.
1004800	1006480	Chris McKenna and I are obsessed,
1006480	1008960	like without having even really re-watched the show,
1008960	1010560	Chris McKenna and I from a community
1010560	1014000	are constantly talking about like doing our Fantasy Island reboot
1014000	1017600	where you focus more on the people that work at Fantasy Island
1017600	1018960	because it's like, what the fuck?
1018960	1020000	For those of you who don't know,
1020000	1021360	you probably have heard the log.
1021360	1023280	You're probably as familiar with it as I am,
1023280	1025280	even though I grew up with it actually on the air.
1025280	1027440	But you probably, because it's such a simple concept,
1027440	1030400	it's Mr. Rourke, Ricardo Montalban,
1031040	1033680	and his diminutive magical friend,
1034400	1036640	Herve Villachez, playing a guy named Tattoo.
1037520	1040400	They both wear white suits and they work on this island.
1040400	1044400	And a sea plane lands with three people or couples.
1044400	1045600	And as they get off the plane,
1046320	1048720	Mr. Tattoo goes, who's that, boss?
1048720	1049840	What about them?
1049840	1051040	Ah, Tattoo.
1051040	1054080	That is a famous author, J.K. Rowling.
1055520	1057360	Sometimes it would be ripped from the headlines
1057360	1059040	in that subtle 70s way.
1059040	1061680	That's a famous author, R.K. Fowler.
1063120	1063840	Oh, I get it.
1065360	1066640	The archetype of the famous author.
1066640	1071840	And I was like, oh god, she sold over 300,000 books.
1071840	1073600	That's half the population of the Earth.
1074320	1076000	That's correct, Tattoo.
1077440	1080640	But she's never experienced the gas shortage.
1081600	1083920	No, I'm just trying to say it's like a 70s show.
1083920	1084400	I don't know.
1084400	1088080	Dan Harmon answers his own TV question.
1088800	1092880	But a massive bulk of the people that came to Fantasy Island,
1097120	1101040	a huge percentage of the people that came to Fantasy Island
1101200	1105760	were getting, they all paid ostensibly, I would say,
1105760	1106640	an exorbitant price.
1106640	1109280	Otherwise, why isn't there a ship full of people?
1109280	1110320	It's always a sea plane.
1110320	1111280	And people are getting off.
1111280	1112160	And they look rich.
1112160	1113680	And they're always best selling authors.
1116320	1117760	So they paid a hefty sum.
1117760	1122240	And then a lot of them came there going,
1122240	1124320	I want to be famous.
1124320	1125840	Or I want to be a rock star.
1125840	1126880	Or I want to be rich.
1126880	1128480	I want to be respected.
1128480	1134640	And a bunch of them, if not all of them, it was like, oh, OK.
1135520	1137200	I guess it's kind of fucked up that you made me
1137200	1138720	get chased by a dinosaur.
1139680	1143600	But now that I think of it, I just needed confidence.
1146400	1146900	Buy.
1148880	1149360	Thank you.
1150000	1154960	Fantasy fulfilled is not the one I paid for, the one I needed.
1155680	1157120	Can I have my money back?
1157120	1159360	My memory is that they were always like,
1159360	1161680	they accidentally found out they needed to fall in love
1161680	1163440	with Orson Welles or somebody.
1163440	1164000	They had to.
1165040	1167200	I mean, all I remember as a kid is it was always like,
1167200	1169760	the only theme I remember constantly was just sort of like,
1169760	1171520	but I'm unhappy now.
1171520	1172800	Yes, but that's the point.
1172800	1173600	Oh, thank you.
1175040	1176800	I could have sworn.
1177600	1182080	I could have gone to McDonald's with 1,000 times less money
1182080	1186320	than I gave you and gotten more opportunity to inspect myself.
1186320	1188960	But would you have hung out with Stephanie?
1190160	1191120	What's her name?
1191120	1191680	Zimbalist.
1193520	1195520	The cast of that show is always great.
1195520	1198880	Well, but that's the only other thing about Fantasy Island
1198880	1200880	is that the fascinating thing is that even though there's
1200880	1203680	three couples that show up at the beginning of the episode,
1205680	1207600	there's always these establishing shots of like,
1207600	1209840	oh, and then Fantasy Island business is going on.
1209840	1212400	And there's like, you see like people,
1212400	1216640	there's like waiters bringing coconut drinks to like,
1216640	1218400	people that are sitting by the side of the pool.
1218400	1220800	And none of those people came in on a sea plane.
1222800	1223680	I think they all did.
1223680	1226080	I think they're all on a Fantasy Island.
1226080	1226960	You think every time.
1226960	1228240	I mean, that's the question is like,
1228240	1230000	is it just a rotation of sea planes?
1230000	1236640	The camera focuses on Stephanie Powers and Robert something.
1236640	1240000	I was assuming more that you could also come to Fantasy Island
1240000	1243520	on a huge shitty ferry from New Jersey or something
1243520	1247600	and like pay $80 a weekend to like sit near rich people
1247600	1250160	who were being taught that they shouldn't need shit as much.
1250880	1253200	Like you're just like, give me another drink.
1253200	1254080	Stop yelling.
1254080	1254720	Hey, whoa.
1255440	1259280	Listen, Mr. Rourke ain't gonna teach you to fucking quit
1259280	1260160	lipping off.
1260160	1262960	So, because we didn't pay for the platinum package.
1262960	1266400	So just fucking do what I say and give me a napkin.
1266400	1269520	I can't wait till we're rich enough to come to this island
1270160	1271840	and tattoo says, who's that?
1271840	1274720	And Mr. Rourke says it's a guy who wishes his wife would shut up
1274720	1276480	so that you get chased by a dinosaur.
1277840	1281200	Yeah, well, I'm looking around and I ain't seeing no dinosaurs.
1282160	1285120	So shut your lip, Rebecca.
1286800	1288800	Oh, it's a living.
1290800	1293600	I was just in Atlantic City and you did a perfect impression
1293600	1294160	of everybody.
1294160	1295040	Every conversation.
1296880	1298720	You just walked down the street and you see,
1299440	1301040	this looks like a lovely couple.
1301040	1303760	And I was like, oh, who's gonna fuck me tonight?
1303760	1305440	You fucking Jamuk.
1305440	1308320	You fucking piece of shit.
1309520	1311760	And that's the guy talking to the girl.
1311760	1314320	And the girl goes, oh, what the fuck are you?
1314320	1314960	You fucking.
1314960	1317440	And then they go, oh, oh, Jeff Davis.
1317440	1318720	We love your show coming tonight.
1318720	1320160	I'm like, that's terrific.
1320720	1322240	And they come up on stage.
1322240	1324720	The audience was drunker than the cast,
1324720	1327920	which we find highly disrespectful.
1328880	1331520	Holy fuck.
1331520	1332560	Jersey audiences.
1333520	1335280	My hat is off to you because, wow.
1338560	1341360	The women smoke and talk like stevedores.
1341360	1342560	It's amazing.
1342560	1343360	I mean, that's hot.
1346400	1348560	But that might be part of the Marisa Tome,
1348560	1351200	my cousin Vinny trope of like, I don't know,
1351200	1353840	but I mean, I like a dirty girl.
1353840	1354720	I told you the story.
1355360	1356080	Have I told the story?
1356080	1357040	I don't like Princess Leia.
1357040	1358320	I don't want to soil Princess Leia.
1358320	1361200	I know I did my little disgusting misogynistic rant
1361200	1363920	about Amy Grant, but that was my old 15-year-old self.
1363920	1364880	I was like, oh, I want to.
1366320	1368720	I have grown into a man that wants to be soiled.
1370160	1372240	And I have found a partner that I feel,
1372240	1375200	I always feel dirtier after I have sex with Cody.
1376160	1379120	And that's why I am proud to give her my fucking.
1382560	1384560	I'm never going to get an erection again after that.
1385840	1387920	I have told the story about what the girl said
1387920	1392400	that was trying to come on to Ryan in Morristown, New Jersey.
1392400	1393760	I've told the story before, haven't I?
1393760	1394400	I don't know.
1395280	1395920	Audience, have a look.
1395920	1396560	Go for it.
1396560	1397600	Just let her rip.
1397600	1398080	All right.
1398080	1401120	So we did a show in Morristown, New Jersey.
1401120	1401760	It's very nice.
1402640	1406160	And it's like the mayo, something is a fancy theater
1406160	1408640	and across the street is a nice pub.
1409600	1410560	We meet some way to show.
1410560	1412000	The Mayo Theater sounds incredible.
1412000	1412160	Yeah, the Mayo Theater.
1412160	1414160	One of the fancy places, like the Mayo Theater.
1414160	1416080	No, like the Mayo Center.
1416160	1420400	It's like an aristocratic kind of, you know, healthy occupational.
1420400	1420880	A healthy man.
1420880	1422320	Asker Meyer Auditorium.
1422320	1422720	Yes.
1422720	1423760	It was Miracle Whip.
1423760	1427040	And we are at this pub across the street.
1427040	1431520	And Ryan and I and Greg Proops and I think Chip Aston,
1431520	1434160	we meet a gang of waitresses and they all say,
1434160	1436720	hey, you guys got to come to this bar after we're done.
1436720	1438160	You got to come to this fucking bar.
1438160	1440640	No, no, no, they're currently working.
1440640	1442320	They're wearing their working tarts.
1442320	1443520	So they can't cuss?
1443520	1444320	They can't cuss.
1444320	1445040	They're being very generic.
1445120	1446480	I think that's how people in Jersey dress.
1446480	1446960	Huh?
1446960	1447440	What?
1447440	1448240	They're like, go ahead.
1448240	1449760	Get the shoe stuff.
1449760	1452400	These are women that are wearing a bow tie and an apron
1452400	1454000	and a thing at our club.
1454000	1455520	We go to a club and it is...
1456800	1459040	I will never forget that when we walked in,
1459040	1462080	Ice, Ice Baby was playing and people were line dancing to it.
1465680	1468480	They were doing the electric slide to Ice, Ice Baby.
1468480	1471440	They were like, oh, shit, it's fucking 1991 right now.
1471440	1472400	It's great.
1472480	1476800	And there was a giant transgender woman, I'll say,
1477680	1479520	who looked like Mean Joe Green,
1480800	1482480	wearing a blue cocktail dress,
1482480	1485440	who immediately fell in love with Ryan Stiles
1485440	1486880	because he knew who he was.
1486880	1488080	You're selling this place.
1489520	1492000	If you go to Morristown, find this fucking place
1492000	1493040	because it's great.
1493040	1494480	Like, it's just drywall.
1495840	1496400	There's nothing.
1496400	1498240	It's just a fucking nightmare.
1498240	1498960	And...
1502400	1503680	We want to hide right now.
1503680	1504640	Are we safe?
1504640	1507120	Ryan Stiles is six foot six, I think.
1507840	1510960	This guy is a head taller than him.
1510960	1512000	The cocktail fella?
1513040	1515920	He's just a person that's at the bar.
1515920	1517040	Oh, okay. Different fella.
1517040	1519920	And Ryan introduced me to him or her and said,
1519920	1522320	hey, Jeff, have you met the little lady?
1523920	1525040	Have you met the little lady?
1525040	1525920	He died laughing.
1525920	1526720	We all had a good time.
1526720	1528400	And then we all went to another bar.
1528400	1531920	And then three girls followed us.
1531920	1536800	One girl who was also like flat footed my height.
1536800	1537600	I'm six four.
1538640	1540160	She, in the middle of the street,
1540160	1541920	just started making out with me.
1541920	1542720	He's six two.
1542720	1543440	This was unheralding.
1543440	1544640	He's six four on his toes.
1546640	1548400	And I go, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
1549520	1551120	And the other girl comes up to me
1551120	1552320	that was coming on to Ryan,
1552960	1554880	who was like the best looking of the trio.
1555360	1557200	And she goes, Jeff, she goes,
1559200	1560640	I want to make out with Ryan tonight.
1560640	1563680	I go, you just told me that that guy right behind us
1563680	1564640	is your fiance.
1565280	1567200	You know that Ryan is married.
1567200	1569280	And she goes, oh, you got to be single
1569280	1570160	to fuck one of you guys.
1574880	1576560	All right. You found you found my
1576560	1577600	I don't want to go there anymore.
1578960	1580480	I don't like I don't like.
1580480	1582480	New Jersey's fucking insane.
1582480	1584720	It's a crazy place made of crazy people.
1584720	1586640	When I got to Boston,
1586640	1589760	like within like three, two hours of being there,
1589760	1591360	I was I got to my hotel
1591360	1592960	and then I left my hotel to get dinner
1592960	1595200	and just walking to a restaurant.
1595200	1596880	I heard two separate people
1596880	1598560	just like call other people
1598560	1601120	that the F word for a gay slur.
1601120	1603200	And I was like, wow, this is just yeah,
1603200	1604160	this is Boston.
1604160	1604640	Okay.
1604640	1606000	Like the two syllable version.
1606000	1607040	Yeah. Yeah.
1607040	1609920	It was I was like, wow, this is it was great.
1610640	1611520	I mean, not great.
1611520	1613680	You know, it was Boston as fuck.
1615040	1615600	Boston.
1615600	1616400	Simpler times.
1617920	1619440	I was in a Thursday.
1619440	1620800	I was in Las Vegas yesterday.
1621840	1622640	I was in Las Vegas.
1622640	1623520	Did someone say Thursday?
1624160	1625360	Yeah, that's what I have.
1625360	1626000	You said that.
1626000	1626160	Yeah.
1627520	1628960	Simpler times Thursday.
1629920	1630720	Yeah. In Boston.
1631600	1632960	I was walking behind two cats
1633680	1635440	at a place in Vegas yesterday.
1635440	1636160	And a guy goes,
1637440	1638240	I'm pretty sure.
1639440	1640640	Philadelphia accent.
1640640	1642480	I can't do a great Philadelphia accent,
1642480	1643520	but I'm guaranteed.
1643520	1644320	Which borough?
1644320	1644560	Huh?
1646000	1646560	You heard me.
1646560	1648400	Which side of the 1015?
1648400	1649520	It's by the fucking thing.
1649520	1650720	What the fuck do you want to talk about?
1650720	1652080	No, so that sounds like.
1652080	1652560	Who am I?
1652560	1653280	The fucking guy?
1653280	1655040	Like a west list.
1655040	1655840	It's by Permanis.
1655840	1657200	And you got to get it off.
1657200	1657920	All right.
1657920	1659200	It's by Permanis.
1661440	1663520	But a guy in front of me wearing a tank top
1664240	1665760	on a Saturday afternoon,
1665760	1667040	as you do in Vegas,
1667040	1669600	if you are determined to never get laid.
1671840	1673280	Sandals and tank tops.
1673840	1675120	One guy in a tank top
1675920	1677600	with a backwards baseball cap
1677600	1679280	says to the other guy in a tank top.
1679840	1681760	What I think with a forward baseball cap,
1681760	1682320	he goes,
1683360	1685440	you fucking motherfucker.
1685440	1686160	He's like,
1686160	1688080	I was up 12 grand.
1688080	1689520	I'm down 12 grand now,
1689520	1691440	you fucking motherfucker.
1691440	1693440	I'm fucking down 12 grand.
1693440	1694320	And the guy's like,
1694320	1696240	but you should have fucking walked away.
1699120	1701520	There's children walking by them.
1701520	1702960	That's the beauty of Vegas.
1702960	1705680	Is that nobody has any fucking
1705680	1707040	heraldry and fucking both.
1707040	1708960	Well, that's how those guys learned.
1708960	1709360	I mean.
1709360	1709840	But also,
1709840	1710800	I like the fact that that guy
1710800	1712320	had 12 grand to throw around.
1713280	1714720	It's not like if you keep those kids
1714720	1715440	out of that place,
1715440	1717040	they all turn into neuro-physicists.
1718640	1720400	They basically end up,
1720400	1722160	85% of them back there going,
1722160	1723120	hey, go away.
1724800	1726080	I hate all of you.
1728000	1729360	If you're down 12 grand,
1729360	1730720	then you're wearing a tank top.
1731520	1732400	That's your fault.
1733360	1735920	Yeah, because it's a choice you make.
1735920	1738160	I'm saying I'm adding the added cynicism
1738160	1740080	that you can't save those kids.
1740720	1743040	Most of them turn out to be fucking idiots.
1744240	1745600	You could raise them in a fucking
1745600	1746880	under a rocket at NASA.
1746880	1747760	I guess that's dangerous.
1749760	1750880	Where's the smartest place
1750880	1751840	you could raise a kid?
1751840	1753360	Where's a kid surrounded?
1754240	1755840	Underneath a giant rocket.
1757280	1759120	I already said that's not a good place.
1759920	1760400	Dummy.
1760720	1764000	You fucking stoogats.
1766720	1768960	Anyways, what I was going to say to you
1768960	1771920	thank you was that,
1772480	1773040	goddamn it.
1773040	1774160	Now I lost it again.
1774160	1775280	No, wait.
1775280	1776400	Shit, shit, shit, shit.
1776400	1777600	Fuck, fuck, fuck.
1777600	1778320	Goddamn it.
1778320	1778880	Goddamn it.
1778880	1779920	It's coming around.
1779920	1780480	You're going to get it.
1780480	1780960	It's about Boston.
1780960	1781600	You're going to get it.
1782400	1783600	It wasn't Boston.
1783600	1784480	No, no, no, no.
1784480	1786720	Way, way back, way back.
1788480	1789120	Memory.
1790000	1791840	Maybe a beat will bring it around for him.
1791840	1792720	Talk in.
1792720	1795280	Try to think about the thoughts in your head.
1796160	1798800	Try to visualize a warehouse instead,
1798800	1800480	like the Dreamcatcher movie
1800480	1802320	when they went through the halls
1803040	1805840	so that you could understand it all
1805840	1808000	about the concept of memory.
1810000	1811920	Oh, did you guys see Dreamcatcher?
1812800	1813600	All right, stop.
1813600	1814640	I just got bummed out.
1816560	1817840	There's a character in the movie,
1818640	1820080	Stephen King's Dreamcatcher.
1822320	1823920	And they're like, oh, man.
1824560	1826720	It's a nine-hour miniseries event.
1827520	1829360	Like, they couldn't figure out
1829360	1831600	what to remove from this tome.
1833040	1834160	It's just adapted.
1834160	1835600	People need to see it.
1835600	1837600	There's words coming out of a typewriter.
1837600	1838400	Like, what do we do?
1838400	1840240	We got to commit it to film.
1840240	1841600	If the book says they did this,
1841600	1842560	they got to do that.
1842560	1844960	If the book says that if the book was 300 pages,
1844960	1846640	then the script's going to be 900 pages
1846640	1847760	if that means that the thing's
1847760	1848880	going to be 10 hours long,
1848880	1850320	then we can't put it in a theater.
1850320	1851920	No theater will fit.
1853120	1854400	Release it on television.
1854400	1855200	There, I said it.
1858000	1860160	Okay, so Dreamcatcher, yeah,
1860960	1865760	it's like a 900-page script for a 10-hour event
1865760	1868960	about a group of grown-ups
1868960	1871120	who get this in their childhood,
1871760	1874080	used to experience magical things
1874080	1875040	that were scary,
1875680	1877680	that taught them that they were special
1877680	1879040	in amorphous ways.
1880000	1882640	So then in adulthood, they get together
1882640	1886000	and the ay-yi-yi find your backspace key.
1889360	1891040	There, I said it.
1892000	1893520	I got drunk enough.
1895440	1896000	What would your...
1896000	1897920	Yeah, I wouldn't do anything.
1897920	1898400	You know why?
1898400	1900080	Because I have enough integrity
1900080	1901760	that I don't ever write anything.
1901760	1902800	What, what, what, what?
1903680	1905120	My fingers tremble
1905120	1907360	with the responsibility above the keys
1907360	1908880	because I'm no hack.
1910240	1912880	I would never finish Monster House.
1915440	1917840	I would have spent another 20 years.
1918400	1919760	You would never know
1919760	1922000	how that house would stop being a monster.
1923280	1925200	I never would have told you how it started.
1925920	1927200	Why did the house become a monster?
1928320	1930800	The lady at a circus didn't get loved enough.
1932080	1933840	They finished that for me.
1935280	1937920	As far as I understood it.
1941040	1942960	The point of the movie was supposed to be,
1942960	1944480	don't ask those questions.
1945200	1946560	They go to the library
1946560	1947360	and they pull out a book
1947360	1948800	and it's supposed to be like...
1948800	1950160	Like, Schwab pitched it
1950160	1951040	and I was like, that's great.
1951040	1952800	Let's just do it this way.
1952800	1953760	They go to the library,
1953760	1954320	they pull out a book
1954320	1955600	and there's a page
1955600	1956800	and it's like Abe Lincoln's
1956800	1958400	fighting a monster log cabin
1958400	1959680	with a coal shovel.
1959680	1960160	And they're like,
1960160	1961120	this has been happening
1961200	1962480	since the beginning of time.
1962480	1963840	Like, there's a word
1963840	1965200	for this kind of demon.
1965200	1966640	It's like a property demon.
1966640	1970400	If you die coveting your property
1970400	1971280	a certain amount
1971280	1972480	and there's like a monster pyramid
1972480	1973360	biting an Egyptian.
1973360	1975360	And it's like if you...
1978640	1979920	Make Monster Pyramid.
1979920	1980800	That's a fucking...
1980800	1981440	That's your movie.
1981440	1982400	Maybe we would have.
1982400	1984400	If they had let me finish
1984400	1985760	that beautiful script.
1986800	1988800	I would be on my third draft by now
1988800	1989600	but they...
1989600	1991680	No, they dragged it out of me.
1991680	1992880	Monster Pyramid.
1992880	1994560	I wanna fucking see that immediately.
1997200	1998080	But you're not supposed to
1998080	1999520	then go find out that...
2000640	2001280	On top of that,
2001280	2002160	there's another reason
2002160	2003120	why the house is a monster
2003120	2004080	and it's not what you thought.
2004080	2005440	It's because of body shaming.
2007200	2008240	I'm fine with that too
2008240	2009520	but it's like I would have removed
2009520	2011200	the Time Life book
2011200	2011920	and I would have like...
2012560	2014560	But I would have not written it
2014560	2015120	is my point.
2015920	2017520	Here I am, 46 years old.
2018320	2021040	Like what am I trying to convince you kids of?
2022960	2024880	The mythology of the auteur.
2024880	2025760	It's garbage.
2025760	2026800	Like what am I?
2026800	2028000	I'm a piece of shit.
2028560	2029600	I'm a terrible...
2029600	2030960	Like I'm a scarecrow.
2030960	2032560	A living scarecrow.
2032560	2034880	I should be a cautionary tale to you.
2034880	2037280	Don't let the crows of your ambition
2037280	2038560	land in my corn.
2040640	2042960	You should see me crucified
2042960	2047440	by my own self-imposed paralysis.
2048240	2050160	That was a lot of redundancy
2050160	2051040	and I would have refined that
2051040	2053200	but I don't have a backspace key in the podcast.
2053200	2054160	I wouldn't have written this scene.
2055120	2055920	Hit the backspace.
2055920	2057520	Okay, let's move on to something else.
2057520	2060080	So it was the fucking...
2060080	2062560	Yeah, thank you.
2062560	2063840	I was talking about...
2063840	2064560	What did I talk about
2064560	2065200	when I first came out?
2066000	2066320	Board games.
2066320	2067280	No, that was me.
2067280	2068400	What did you talk about?
2070560	2071040	Go back.
2071040	2071540	Right.
2072320	2073600	Could you just say forts?
2073600	2074880	School papers.
2074880	2075680	School papers.
2075680	2076640	Ah, yes.
2076640	2078240	Yes, thanks.
2078240	2079040	Good job, guys.
2079040	2079520	Thank you.
2079520	2080400	We did it.
2080400	2081600	We worked as a team.
2081600	2084080	Teamwork makes the dream work.
2087520	2089360	I just wanted to let you know
2089360	2090960	that on my school paper
2092800	2096320	I tried to write a serialized
2097440	2099200	medieval fantasy piece.
2099200	2100720	Yeah, that's awesome.
2100720	2102080	That was gonna be this epic thing.
2102080	2102800	It was called like
2102800	2104880	The Legend of Falstaff or something.
2105840	2106400	And I was like,
2106400	2107920	I think I wrote like two installments
2107920	2109600	and just like walked away from it.
2109600	2110080	Yeah.
2110080	2110640	Because I was like,
2110640	2112320	this is so long and rambling.
2113920	2115040	I don't want to do this anymore.
2116000	2118080	My friend used to just do like
2118080	2120800	fraudulent articles in his school newspaper.
2120800	2121840	And it would just be all like,
2122720	2124960	there's a new Coke in the Pepsi machine
2124960	2126800	because Russia's trying to initiate
2126800	2128960	a new Red Scare or something like that.
2129920	2131040	He's ahead of his time.
2131040	2131280	Yeah.
2132560	2133600	And that guy's name
2134320	2135120	Reince Priebus.
2136880	2137360	Thank you.
2137360	2139200	I got one big laugh from a dude.
2139200	2140240	It's a funny name.
2140240	2142800	That guy loves the Priebus.
2142800	2145760	You laughed harder than I hoped anybody would.
2149280	2150880	I don't know how you pronounce
2150880	2151760	Priebus' first name.
2151760	2152800	I think it's Rance.
2152800	2153360	Rance.
2153360	2153840	Rance.
2153840	2154640	Rance.
2154640	2155120	Rance.
2155120	2155520	Rance.
2155520	2156160	Rance.
2156160	2157280	I like that you were kind of like,
2157280	2158400	that was like after 9-11
2158400	2159760	when my grandma was like,
2159760	2162720	what's up with that bin Laden?
2163760	2166000	Like, you haven't heard bin Laden's name
2166000	2166960	said by anyone?
2167920	2170400	Like that old person like,
2170400	2171040	impulse to be like,
2171040	2171920	I'm not going to fucking
2171920	2173680	say the vowels of their name, right?
2173680	2174880	The fuck have they done for me?
2174880	2176320	Bin Laden!
2176320	2180480	Dan, you still say bagel instead of bagel.
2180480	2182800	That's not because I fucking wish bagels
2182800	2185440	would burn in hell because they fucking injured
2185440	2188000	an evil and cryotere.
2188000	2189760	You certainly must have heard the word bagel
2189760	2190800	more than you pronounce the word bagel.
2190800	2193280	My fucking grandma just learned the word
2193360	2194560	the same time everyone else did.
2194560	2195920	She's watching the towers go down.
2195920	2197440	She sees bin Laden.
2197440	2199920	Wolf, Wolf Blitzer says bin Laden.
2199920	2202160	What the, you telling me my fucking grandma
2202160	2203040	doesn't have the option?
2203040	2203760	She's dead now.
2203760	2204240	Are you happy?
2206000	2206480	I am.
2208960	2210000	How is that comparable?
2210000	2212800	I'm talking about you not saying bagel.
2212800	2213680	Yeah, I know.
2213680	2216240	It's crazy that you're drawing that parallel.
2216240	2217040	It's crazy.
2218000	2218880	It's crazy.
2223280	2225280	I can't say bagel.
2225280	2226400	I try not to.
2226400	2228320	I don't know what you people are talking about.
2229040	2229680	Bagel.
2229680	2231360	It's spelled like a fucking bag.
2232880	2236160	I sometimes, you know, at this point in my life,
2236160	2237760	I've tried to own it.
2237760	2239200	I've tried to celebrate it.
2239200	2241360	I've tried to fucking fix it.
2241360	2243840	You people are ridiculous.
2243840	2245040	I'd like, like, everyone should-
2245040	2246880	You people start ridiculous.
2246880	2248880	I'll go, I'll apparently, every once in a while,
2248880	2250960	by the way, apparently I'll accidentally say bagel.
2251760	2252640	Is that bagel?
2252800	2254720	You have to act like you're going to eat one?
2254720	2255360	Like bagel.
2256880	2259680	Like, apparently I'll accidentally do that sometimes,
2259680	2263520	because when I do, that's where the shit really flies.
2263520	2266560	It's like the time I combed my hair in seventh grade.
2266560	2267760	I never again.
2269040	2270960	Whoa, dude, dude, whoa.
2270960	2272000	You combed your hair.
2272720	2274880	Yeah, like, on accident.
2276240	2279680	Because believe me, I'm not taking fucking notes from you.
2279680	2282800	You fucking immaculate piece of shit.
2283600	2287600	You horrible precursor to 30 years of suffering
2288880	2291120	that will culminate in it being unfashionable
2291120	2292160	for me to be a victim.
2295440	2296800	You ever thought about how it feels?
2299600	2301200	For my career to culminate
2301200	2303760	right when old white men aren't fun anymore?
2305600	2306240	Think about-
2306240	2308080	What did you think about me for a second?
2310320	2313680	It's high time that white men had a platform.
2313680	2314160	Yeah.
2315840	2317520	Well, it's a high time we kept it.
2318560	2320560	I guess is what I just got here.
2320560	2322000	I just got on that platform.
2322000	2323440	I clambered up it.
2323440	2325440	I felt like a woman.
2326880	2328640	I had to work so hard getting up.
2328640	2329920	I don't even know what it's like to be white,
2329920	2331040	but it can't be any different.
2331840	2333040	I'm going to explain it all.
2334560	2336000	What do you mean you don't want to hear from me?
2337600	2338320	Where are you going?
2338320	2339040	Come back.
2340000	2343760	All right, I'll just buy this house over here.
2343760	2346000	Hey, did you make a sketch where you fucked a baby?
2346000	2346960	No, it wasn't a real baby!
2348160	2349760	But you never heard the word bagel?
2350560	2351360	Goddamn it!
2352720	2354320	I only ever saw it in print.
2355120	2357680	I didn't grow up in a fucking fancy house like yours.
2359840	2360720	Ham and rules.
2360720	2362320	I know how to pronounce ham and rules.
2363680	2364880	You fucking debutantes.
2366640	2369280	Are you saying that you were so deep into Wisconsin
2369360	2370720	that there was no bagel shops around?
2370720	2372560	We had bagels, but they were fucking...
2374240	2375920	It's not a regional thing, okay?
2375920	2378800	I grew up fucking poor, and I was like...
2378800	2379760	No, you fucking didn't.
2379760	2380320	Yeah, I did.
2380320	2380960	No, you didn't.
2382160	2382880	Prove I didn't.
2383760	2384560	Oh, shit.
2385120	2386720	Show us the tax returns.
2388640	2390000	I grew up so poor.
2390000	2390560	Wait, I'm gonna...
2390560	2392320	How poor were you?
2392320	2392720	Did you grow up?
2392720	2397680	My Tonka trucks were tonsil trucks.
2397680	2401280	They were removed tonsils from privileged kids
2401280	2402560	who could have their tonsils removed.
2403440	2405120	My tonsils rotted in the back of my throat,
2405120	2407040	and I had to swallow them and donate my shit
2407040	2409200	to the coal company that my dad worked for.
2410000	2411280	Also, I heard you were pretty poor.
2412080	2413680	How poor was he?
2413680	2414480	How poor did you grow up?
2415440	2418320	I just told you, and I was like a really reliable metric.
2418320	2419040	No, do another one.
2419040	2422240	Top five, how poor was Dan Harmon growing up?
2422240	2424400	When I got it.
2425200	2428320	What'd you do with paper plates?
2429360	2430560	Probably something funny.
2430560	2431040	Well, don't...
2431040	2431440	You can't...
2434320	2437600	Dan was so poor, his uncle died,
2437600	2439200	and came back as a hillbilly,
2439200	2442480	and the doctor called it a case of reincarnation.
2444720	2446400	That's so fucking poor.
2447520	2450800	That's how poor Dan's family was.
2450800	2451760	Reincarnation.
2451760	2452000	Wow.
2452960	2456080	Your family's so poor that they taught you
2456080	2461280	how to stretch a premise connection like that thing.
2461280	2463360	A bartender told me that joke in Sacramento
2463360	2465120	four days ago, and I'm like, no.
2465120	2466400	Here's how poor you are.
2467680	2469840	Two guys walked into a bar, right?
2471920	2473600	My Lincoln Logs were real logs there.
2473600	2475040	That's the one I had in the chamber.
2475040	2475760	All right.
2475760	2476960	Now, listen, no, we got a lot...
2476960	2478080	Do you know the difference between...
2479040	2484320	No, what Dale Earnhardt and Pink Floyd have in common?
2487200	2488960	Both of their last hits was The Wall.
2491600	2493040	Oh, such crass.
2493040	2494240	That's wildling humor.
2494240	2494960	No heraldry.
2494960	2495840	That's a wildling joke.
2495840	2497520	There's no heraldry anymore.
2497520	2498880	That's a fucking good joke.
2498880	2500240	No heraldry.
2500240	2502400	I was like, maybe if the Lannisters bullied you
2502400	2506240	for your whole life, and you were thrown to the wolves,
2506240	2507760	and then you were raised by white walkers,
2507760	2509520	but you fight them enough for them to respect you,
2509520	2512640	and then you were redhead whittling in a cave.
2512640	2513920	Maybe I'd let you laugh at that.
2515600	2517120	If you were like that one...
2517120	2517680	Yeah.
2517680	2518880	I'm House Lannister.
2518880	2519520	What was your name?
2519520	2520320	Team Cersei.
2520880	2521760	I'm Team Cersei.
2521760	2522720	Team Cersei.
2522720	2524240	What about those sleeves, honey?
2526560	2527440	I don't know whether to...
2528400	2529440	Where this or...
2530240	2531360	What is it, a slanket?
2531360	2531840	All right.
2536320	2536880	It doesn't...
2536880	2538320	I appreciate you guys being here.
2540560	2543440	Dan, do you know why Joseph Stalin only
2543440	2544640	wrote in lowercase letters?
2545360	2546480	Wait, why always...
2547440	2548640	I hated capitalism.
2548640	2549440	Yes, of course.
2549440	2549920	Yay.
2551840	2555440	Do you know why ducks have tail feathers?
2557600	2559120	To protect their capitalism.
2561920	2563200	Because they hate capitalism.
2565760	2566080	Why?
2566880	2568640	Is to protect their butt quacks.
2570160	2570960	Butt quacks?
2570960	2571680	Yes.
2571680	2572720	They have butt quacks.
2572720	2574080	Because they're ducks, Dan.
2576640	2578080	They also have regular assholes.
2578720	2580560	Have a little glee in your life.
2580560	2582160	Learn how to be a child again.
2583840	2585600	That's just willful absurdity.
2585600	2587760	That's not childhood innocence.
2588720	2589920	They also have butt cracks.
2591360	2592640	They have tail feathers.
2592640	2593680	But they don't have butt cracks.
2593680	2595040	They have butt quacks because they're ducks.
2595040	2600640	Well, then say, what do ducks go to the proctologist to have inspected?
2600640	2601840	Their butt quacks.
2601840	2602240	Answer.
2602240	2603520	All right, let me answer.
2603520	2604000	Ask me.
2605040	2605680	Yes, what?
2607120	2607680	Butt quacks.
2608960	2611200	What's the difference between what I did and what you did?
2611200	2613520	Mine is more efficient.
2615920	2620720	Mine is nature is saying that God gave them tail feathers to protect their butt quacks
2620720	2624080	so that they don't have to go to seek medical attention.
2625840	2629440	Jeff, why do you comb your butt?
2631120	2632400	I don't.
2633520	2635040	Then why do you have a part in the middle?
2637760	2640480	Do you know why the toilet paper could not cross the road?
2641520	2643840	It tee-peezes.
2643840	2645520	No, it got stuck in a crack.
2653520	2654880	Yeah, I mean, that worked.
2655200	2657840	By the way, for the record, I approve of that kind of wordplay.
2657840	2658880	I don't laugh at it.
2659680	2661280	But I'm like, OK, that scans.
2661280	2662000	I'm fine.
2662000	2663840	The butt quack thing, I'm not going to whatever.
2664800	2667520	Dan, a friend of mine just got a job as a security guard.
2670400	2674800	And his job was, this boss told him, you got to watch The Office.
2674800	2676320	And he's on season three right now.
2679920	2680640	He loves it.
2680640	2681920	He fucking loves it.
2681920	2683120	He hates it, but he loves it.
2683840	2685360	Can you make him Polish or blonde?
2685360	2686480	He's mad it wasn't humidity.
2686480	2687840	He's mad it wasn't humidity.
2688400	2689440	I don't think so.
2689440	2692640	All right, so not that we, I mean, this steam train's steaming.
2692640	2695760	But like, I was going to...
2697120	2698800	I dropped a suit off of the dry cleaner.
2700160	2700640	OK.
2701200	2703920	Well, let me, let's just make this a segment so I can sit down for it.
2704720	2705280	I feel like...
2705280	2706080	Press the button.
2707200	2707920	Have I told you something?
2707920	2709760	Well, I tried.
2709760	2712080	Jeff's joke corner.
2712720	2715840	Jeff's joke corner.
2717520	2720240	Jeff's got a million of them.
2720240	2720960	This is not a joke.
2721760	2726400	This is an actual slice of life, daily Jeff Davis kind of information.
2726400	2727600	I got one of those too.
2727600	2730960	There's a white nationalist in the Oval Office.
2730960	2732720	I could use a joke.
2733680	2734800	Jeff's joke.
2734800	2735840	All right, Spencer, you got one?
2735840	2738400	What did the hot dog say to the sausage?
2738400	2738960	You go first.
2738960	2741120	No, no, yours is going to be better.
2741360	2742640	That's why I want you to go first.
2742640	2743680	Oh, no.
2743680	2745840	OK, so I was driving down the road.
2746400	2746960	What was it?
2747760	2752000	The five north towards Sun Valley, right?
2752000	2756880	And I see an ambulance and it's going buck wild.
2756880	2761280	And the back opens up and this ice chest flies out.
2761280	2762320	And so I pull over.
2762320	2763120	Wait, does this really happen?
2763120	2763840	Oh, yeah.
2763840	2768880	And so I pull over and I get it and there's a human toe inside.
2768880	2769200	OK.
2770080	2770720	Yeah.
2770720	2772240	So I called the tow truck.
2772240	2772400	Yes.
2773120	2773600	Yeah.
2774800	2777120	Just Joe Carter.
2777120	2778320	That's Joe Carter.
2778320	2779120	Yes.
2779120	2784720	OK, I don't know how to I'm familiar with a set of circumstances also related to the
2784720	2789120	medical community that surround a set of circumstances.
2789120	2790080	Buckle up, everybody.
2791520	2794960	I don't know the wording right because it seems to me that the only way to tell the
2794960	2797360	joke is to repeat the same word in the setup is in the punch line.
2797360	2798800	That's the part I can't figure out.
2798800	2799280	Right.
2799280	2800160	That's what's tricky.
2800560	2802880	I'm going to construct it in a way that doesn't require that.
2802880	2803280	Yes.
2803280	2804080	That's the hard part.
2804080	2804960	Just shoot from the hip.
2804960	2805760	No, no, no, no, no.
2805760	2806240	I'm going to.
2806240	2807920	Spam prayer, baby.
2807920	2815280	There's a guy went into the doctor and this just happened and the doctor said,
2815280	2817600	hello, how can I help you?
2817600	2821440	And the guy was like, well, I don't know.
2821440	2822240	How do I start?
2822240	2823840	Like, should you shrink me down?
2824800	2827040	And the doctor's like, what?
2828000	2831520	Well, this is not a conversation I ever have in here.
2831520	2833920	Like, oh, like we don't have that kind of technology.
2833920	2835600	And the guy's like, well, what do you have?
2835600	2838560	Like a large bottle that I fit in.
2839200	2841360	And the doctor's like, whoa, sir, please.
2841360	2842720	We could go on like this forever.
2842720	2845200	But like, just explain to me what's going on.
2845200	2849600	He's like, I just, I saw the sign outside your building.
2849600	2851360	It said vitamin B1.
2851360	2858960	Yeah, Jeff Joe corner.
2858960	2866800	I hear your, I'm really, I'm going to listen to a playback of the sound you guys just finished
2866800	2870000	making because there was a lot of victory in it.
2870000	2872480	Like I kind of thought it was like a rolling thunder.
2872480	2875360	Like you guys were like kind of like just uncomfortable.
2875360	2875760	Oh yeah.
2875760	2880800	But part of it was that I like invited you into a kind of a magical world.
2880880	2881600	They were ready.
2882160	2886400	Like it wasn't like, oh, you suck to tell him a joke or that guy's dumb for wanting to be a
2886400	2887120	vitamin.
2887120	2888160	They were.
2888160	2889680	I do have a lot of questions about him too.
2889680	2890320	That's what you were.
2890320	2891840	You were like, oh, fuck.
2891840	2893040	What kind of world is this?
2893040	2896000	This guy wants to be a vitamin that bad just because a sign told him.
2896000	2897280	He wanted to be a vitamin.
2897280	2900720	Like what if he passed a sign that was like, I mean, who knows what that guy could have read
2900720	2901200	that day.
2902000	2906400	He doesn't, he's even, he's gone to, he's gotten to the point in his head where he's
2906400	2908640	interpreting letters as verbs.
2908640	2909840	Like it's just B1.
2909840	2910880	And he's like, I got it.
2910880	2911520	I got it.
2911520	2912720	Yeah, I get it.
2912720	2914000	You didn't want to waste time with that sign.
2914000	2918480	I'll go ask the doctor how to shrink me because in the original joke, it's like the guy says,
2918480	2919520	I want to be a vitamin.
2920720	2921600	That's not a real joke.
2921600	2922640	You can't say that.
2922640	2924080	The guy says, I want to be a vitamin.
2924080	2925360	And the doctor says, why?
2925360	2927840	And the guy says, because the sign said vitamin B1.
2928400	2932240	Well, the doctor would be like, well, you can't use the word vitamin and B in your fucking
2932240	2932560	setup.
2932560	2934160	And the guy would be like, I'm not a joke.
2935680	2938320	Doctor would be like, well, then you're just a psychopath.
2938320	2939440	You're dangerous.
2940400	2942800	Like Sirhan had more going on.
2944320	2945760	And he shot a Kennedy.
2948400	2949520	And the guy's like, who's that?
2949520	2950720	This joke's from the 50s.
2951600	2955680	Like vitamin B1 signs were so new that people were like, what if this happened?
2957680	2961760	People were so scared vitamin advertisements were going to undermine the fabric.
2962560	2964320	They're like, hey, did you hear about that guy?
2964320	2968880	Someone's going to see that sign and walk right in there and try to turn into a vitamin.
2970080	2971760	That was their definition of problems.
2971760	2975360	They reflected growing tensions of abbreviations at the time.
2975360	2978400	And then they went to Woodstock and they just fucked the planet.
2979520	2981120	They were like, oh, peace, love.
2981120	2982880	Fuck, what if this is a polar ice cap?
2982880	2983600	Let me smoke that.
2983600	2985120	I don't even know what these people were doing.
2985840	2986960	I know it's all their fault.
2989200	2989680	That's right.
2989680	2990880	So you guys, well, you heard me.
2991440	2992320	They're smoking the ice.
2992320	2992960	I didn't stutter.
2994320	2997440	I assume your grandparents, my parents, they hurt you.
2997440	2998160	They did it.
2998160	2999200	We got to blame somebody.
3000320	3003760	They loved the Beatles and they ruined everything.
3005040	3006320	I'm not on Twitter anymore.
3006320	3012320	I got to like, I can't blame the attorney general for anything.
3012320	3013600	I can't remember his name.
3013600	3014640	Roseanne Barr.
3017280	3018960	What do you think of that Mueller report, Jeff?
3019680	3020720	You got any thoughts on that?
3020720	3024160	I thought it was pretty fucking disappointing.
3024160	3027040	And it was always going to be disappointing.
3027040	3030480	And this motherfucker is going to get reelected.
3030480	3031760	Fucking mark my words.
3031760	3033520	I don't mean to be the voice of doom,
3033520	3035680	but why do you think otherwise?
3036560	3038800	Is Beto O'Rourke going to come save the day?
3038800	3039600	Oh, yeah.
3039600	3040480	He's going to do it.
3040480	3041360	No, he's fucking not.
3041360	3041920	Oh, yeah.
3041920	3042800	He's going to win.
3042800	3043200	No.
3043200	3044000	He's going to win.
3044000	3044720	No, he's not.
3044720	3046800	I bought 50 bucks on him winning.
3048880	3050080	We're betting tonight.
3050080	3051120	We're taking bets.
3051120	3051600	I forgot.
3051600	3052800	It's March Madness.
3052800	3053440	Oh, yeah.
3054160	3055520	Purdue in overtime.
3055520	3057760	Yeah, a lot of something.
3057760	3060000	So Dan, did you hear that I took my suit
3060000	3063120	into the dry cleaners the other day?
3063120	3063760	Yeah.
3063760	3065920	And as I do, because I wear a lot of suits.
3067040	3067840	I'm on the road a lot.
3067840	3068640	I travel.
3068640	3070080	I wear a lot of suits.
3070080	3072240	And I took my suit into the dry cleaners.
3072240	3073360	And she said, come again.
3073360	3075200	And I said, well, no, it's just a little toothpaste.
3076720	3077200	Yeah.
3078480	3079040	I like it.
3079040	3079520	I like it.
3080400	3083680	Because she assumes that I have jizz all over my suit.
3083680	3084080	Yeah.
3084080	3085040	And you assume.
3085600	3087280	That she was like, again?
3087280	3090720	I think that she is very justified
3090720	3093920	because I frequently jerk off all over my suits.
3093920	3095120	Well, no.
3095120	3097440	It's like, if the call of dressing like that
3097440	3099440	isn't to make other people come, what is it?
3099440	3100000	Uh-huh.
3100000	3100320	Nothing.
3100320	3100640	Go ahead.
3100640	3101600	Keep going.
3101600	3102880	I didn't assume it was your cum.
3104720	3105200	She did.
3105840	3106400	How do you know?
3106400	3107440	You don't know what she was thinking.
3107440	3108880	Tell the duck joke.
3108880	3109520	Okay.
3109520	3109920	Okay.
3112160	3114240	The duck, no, wait.
3114640	3116320	I fucked it up.
3116320	3116880	I ruined it.
3116880	3117360	I ruined it.
3117360	3119840	A guy goes to a brothel.
3121600	3126320	And he says, I want to have sex with a sex worker,
3126320	3128160	but I only have a dollar.
3128160	3132320	And the brothel manager says, then you can have this,
3132320	3134960	use this duck and gives him a duck.
3134960	3136400	And he goes upstairs with the duck.
3137440	3141200	And he comes back down.
3141200	3144160	And he says, that was the best.
3144160	3145680	Sex ever.
3146400	3148400	I can't believe it only cost a dollar.
3148400	3150160	I probably shouldn't feed back this much.
3153680	3154400	He's filling out.
3154400	3154880	But fuck it.
3154880	3156240	I want to live in a transparent society
3156240	3159200	where you should know customer satisfaction.
3159200	3159920	Thumbs up.
3159920	3161120	Best dollar I ever spent.
3161120	3162160	Best sex I ever had.
3162160	3162560	Goodbye.
3162560	3169040	My name's Herman Johnson from the North Hampshire Johnsons.
3169920	3171920	Okay.
3171920	3173440	You know, my branch of the family
3173440	3175280	represents a bit of a black sheep.
3175280	3177040	Apparently we have Woody Woodpecker in the crowd.
3178240	3179200	Oh, totally.
3179200	3180000	Let's not attack him.
3180000	3182080	That was the greatest laugh of all time.
3182080	3184080	Most involuntary laugh, for sure.
3184080	3185920	No one would sound that way on purpose.
3190560	3192320	He did a full on Woody Woodpecker.
3194320	3196240	Anyways, that was an intentional departure.
3196240	3198080	The truth is I can tell this joke effortlessly
3198080	3200400	and sound like a regular road comic.
3201280	3204320	The guy then comes back the next day.
3204320	3206000	The sun goes down and comes back up.
3206000	3207360	There's other things that happen in the town.
3207360	3207680	It's not...
3208960	3210240	This isn't the most important thing
3210240	3211280	that's happening in the town,
3211280	3212320	but it's just where we are.
3213520	3216480	And the guy comes back in and he goes,
3216480	3219760	I would like to have the same sex for the same price.
3221680	3223600	And they're like, here's your duck.
3223600	3224000	Oh, fuck.
3224000	3224800	No, they don't say that.
3225600	3228400	They say, here's...
3229200	3229440	Fuck.
3229440	3230240	They don't say anything.
3230240	3232160	Because if they do, it fucks it up.
3232160	3232640	They put...
3233600	3234720	But I also can't say...
3238240	3239760	It's going to end up being a different duck
3239760	3242160	and I have to work around that.
3243360	3244000	How do you do that?
3244960	3246240	How do you not refer to the duck
3246240	3248400	as either the duck or a duck?
3248400	3250160	If you say a duck, it tips the punchline.
3250160	3252720	He asks for the duck and they give him a duck.
3252720	3254240	Do you have the duck?
3254240	3255600	Okay, I'll watch it and it says,
3255600	3257840	do you have the duck?
3257840	3259360	I'll have the duck again.
3259920	3260560	And they're like...
3262000	3264080	And they silently put a duck on the counter.
3265760	3266480	And he's like...
3267360	3268400	I can't believe you...
3269200	3272480	White feathers, orange bill, quacks.
3272480	3273440	You can't tell this joke.
3273440	3274000	You've told it.
3274000	3275040	See you in a minute.
3276160	3278480	And I'll pay you afterward this time
3278480	3281280	because even though last time
3281280	3283520	it started with me telling you
3283520	3284320	how much money I had
3284320	3286240	and you giving me the duck because of the price,
3287040	3289120	this time the transaction has changed
3289120	3290640	even though I'm back for the same thing.
3291840	3293440	There's an unspoken sort of like,
3293440	3294400	I'm good for it.
3294400	3295680	I'm a satisfied customer.
3295680	3296880	You've seen my Yelp review.
3296880	3298880	I'm not going to balk at the price.
3298880	3300000	I don't expect it to change.
3300000	3301120	It's been one day.
3301920	3304480	But thanks for the duck.
3305200	3306080	And the person's like...
3307040	3308240	They just nod because...
3310000	3313280	Because the less he knows, the better at this point.
3314240	3317360	So he has again...
3317360	3318320	Dan, pause.
3318320	3319360	Hit pause.
3319360	3320400	Hold your thought.
3320400	3321520	Are you fucking around?
3321520	3323600	Are you really that bad at remembering this joke?
3324320	3325680	I'm telling the judge.
3325680	3326960	I know I'm taking longer,
3326960	3330800	but I'm pointing out spots that I'm getting hung up on.
3330800	3331280	Okay.
3332400	3332640	Okay.
3333280	3333600	Play.
3334400	3334800	It wasn't...
3334800	3335360	Not the part.
3335360	3336320	I did the part as a joke
3336320	3338720	like where the guy had the guy's family, whatever.
3338720	3339520	Like that was a joke
3339520	3341360	because I didn't think I would get hung up again
3341360	3341680	by other stuff.
3341760	3343840	He comes back in and he gets the other thing.
3343840	3345600	So he has more sex with the...
3345600	3347360	What he thinks is that...
3347360	3348000	But he doesn't...
3348000	3350000	He's just up there.
3350000	3350560	It doesn't matter.
3350560	3351760	The camera stays down here.
3351760	3352240	And then he...
3355680	3357760	So he comes back down with the duck.
3357760	3360240	And by the duck, we now mean the duck he's holding.
3360240	3361680	So we're none the wiser.
3362800	3364880	And he puts it on the counter.
3364880	3366960	He says, now I'm going to settle my tab.
3367440	3367680	Right.
3368560	3372400	Here's the dollar that I paid last time for sex with the duck.
3373520	3377040	And the sex worker tender says...
3378960	3380640	Sex worker tender.
3381440	3383360	Welcome to the 90s, bro.
3392160	3393440	The kids call it being weak.
3395600	3396400	You need to get weak.
3397680	3398320	Okay.
3400320	3400480	Okay.
3400480	3403520	So the guy comes back down with the duck.
3403520	3404000	Right.
3404000	3404640	He puts it on the counter.
3404640	3405440	He put his dollar down.
3405440	3407920	He's leaving because he figures transaction complete.
3409280	3410720	And the person behind the counter...
3411520	3413360	Let's make her a woman just because there's been nothing
3413360	3415120	but ducks and men in this story.
3415120	3416240	And I'm not white knighting.
3416240	3416880	I'm just like...
3416880	3418720	And also gender's a construct.
3419840	3421200	The duck, we don't even know.
3421200	3421920	We'll never know.
3421920	3422800	We don't have to know.
3427840	3430000	I can't tell if you're doing a bit or not.
3430000	3432800	Like, how much of this is you just like...
3432800	3436800	The female brothel manager...
3437440	3438560	The sex worker tender.
3439440	3440960	Madam feels problematic, but...
3442080	3442880	I don't know why.
3442880	3444320	You'll find out five minutes from now.
3444320	3445280	And then it won't be too late.
3445280	3446320	You'll be fired, Nova.
3446960	3449040	You kids, you understand the world you're joining?
3449920	3451040	These walls have teeth.
3452480	3453040	And ears.
3453040	3453760	You're a good kid.
3453760	3454640	You still have time.
3455600	3456640	Just say nothing.
3457120	3457840	You'll be safe.
3458400	3461600	This joke is five sentences, by the way.
3462400	3463120	It's good.
3463120	3464240	The sex trafficker.
3464240	3465360	How can you be so cavalier?
3466560	3467360	Madam, madam.
3467360	3468640	Doesn't that just seem like something
3468640	3470240	that's going to be offensive a week from now?
3471120	3471760	Okay, all right.
3471760	3472160	Well, I'll...
3473120	3474080	Take us back to...
3474080	3474800	Stay with me.
3474800	3475680	You lead the way.
3475680	3477280	Like, I'll keep my eyes closed.
3477280	3478720	You're just going, dad, come through here.
3479680	3481600	Right now our protagonist is where?
3481600	3483840	Okay, so he's halfway across the room.
3483840	3484080	Okay.
3484320	3487120	Well, because he put his dollar down,
3487120	3489760	and as far as he's concerned, this is how this place works.
3489760	3491360	Because he paid a dollar.
3491360	3492320	He's settled up.
3492320	3494560	And the madam, I mean...
3494560	3495920	Yes, the sex worker tender.
3495920	3496880	The sex trafficker.
3496880	3502800	Says, whoa, whoa, whoa, come back here.
3502800	3503840	Finish paying.
3504400	3505360	And the guy's like, what?
3506160	3507520	Put a dollar down.
3507520	3509520	And they're like, it's five dollars.
3509520	3513280	And he's like, I came here yesterday
3513360	3516800	and had sex with a duck for a dollar.
3516800	3519120	And the manager says, yeah, that duck had AIDS.
3519840	3521840	Jeff's joke corner.
3522560	3524400	Jeff's joke corner.
3525280	3526960	Jeff's joke corner.
3527600	3529520	He's pouring drinks on his butt.
3532800	3534080	Jeff's joke corner.
3534080	3536640	No, I failed to protect my butt quack.
3538640	3540400	Jeff's joke corner.
3540400	3543040	I spilled drink all over my...
3544000	3545120	Was that your long comment?
3545120	3546720	You're going to do that joke afterwards?
3546720	3550080	Because in this universe, they charge by the client's STD.
3551120	3552080	Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.
3552080	3554080	But this duck doesn't have AIDS.
3554080	3556960	And so that's why it's about the current...
3556960	3559280	Why is this duck five dollars and the other one's a dollar?
3559920	3560720	Well, it does now.
3560720	3562080	All right, let me try again now.
3562080	3562320	No!
3563920	3565840	No, now that I have all the...
3565840	3566720	I debugged.
3566720	3567440	Tell it.
3567440	3569280	Tell it like pedal to the metal.
3569280	3570560	I swear to God, gun to my head.
3570560	3572720	Like, you're going to kill my family.
3572720	3576400	You're two-faced and you're like, I'm like, I'm Commissioner Gordon.
3576400	3580160	And like, wait, whose kid was going to get killed?
3580160	3581120	Was it Commissioner Gordon?
3581120	3584080	Dan Herman tells the duck joke perfectly and fast.
3584080	3584640	All right.
3584640	3586160	A guy walks into a whorehouse.
3586160	3589280	It's going to be problematic because I just need to not pause for like...
3589280	3590560	It's a whorehouse.
3590560	3591440	Just start the fucking joke.
3591440	3592240	And it's a madam.
3593600	3595920	It really is like a five or seven seconds joke.
3595920	3598560	My transgender caveman friend, my non-binary...
3598560	3602320	Tell the joke about...
3602320	3605040	No of us, like, regressive fucking phraseology.
3605040	3606000	I'm just going to go with it.
3606000	3606560	Madams.
3607360	3609520	Dan, to warm up, tell the joke about why...
3610800	3613200	What do you call a hen that can count her own eggs?
3613200	3614800	Like, just to warm yourself up.
3615840	3618000	What do you call a hen that can count her own eggs?
3618000	3620000	Yes.
3620000	3621440	A feminist?
3622240	3623360	What? I don't...
3623360	3625040	No, a math of a chicken.
3625040	3626320	No, math of a chicken.
3626320	3627200	You're warmed up now.
3627200	3628000	Okay, all right.
3628240	3628720	What?
3630240	3631440	It's poultry in motion.
3631440	3633200	Now you're ready to fucking go now.
3634480	3636880	You are ready to tell the fucking duck joke.
3636880	3638640	For the first time in your life.
3638640	3639760	Are you ready, Dan?
3639760	3640640	Yeah, but...
3640640	3641280	All right, yeah.
3642640	3646080	Okay, a guy goes into a whorehouse where you get whores.
3648880	3650240	And he goes to the madam.
3650240	3651840	It's just such an ugly word, Nova.
3653920	3656880	And he goes, like, fuck.
3657280	3658400	You got me nervous now.
3660720	3661360	It's good.
3661360	3664400	I want sex and I'm paying for it.
3664400	3665280	I wouldn't be here.
3667600	3669360	I can't tell if you're doing a joke or not.
3669360	3669920	What does he say?
3669920	3671200	What do I get for a dollar?
3671200	3672960	Yeah, what do I get for a dollar?
3672960	3673520	Yeah, yeah.
3674240	3674880	Okay, all right, all right.
3674880	3675440	Let me start over.
3675440	3675920	He smacks you down.
3675920	3679360	A guy walks into a whorehouse with a heart dick and a dollar.
3679360	3683040	And he's like, put something on my dick for a dollar.
3683040	3685840	And the whore manager's like, take this duck.
3685840	3689200	And he's like, he runs upstairs and he fucks the shit out of it.
3689200	3691760	He runs back down and he's like, great sex.
3692320	3693920	No change, bye.
3693920	3696320	And he comes back in like a fucking hour later.
3696320	3697440	He's like, more duck.
3697440	3698320	And they give him another one.
3698320	3699360	And he like, runs up.
3699360	3701280	He's like, fucking fucks it all the hell.
3701280	3703920	And he comes back down and goes, like, oh, same difference.
3703920	3705280	Like, this one's $5.
3705280	3706800	He's like, that one's more expensive.
3706800	3708080	Like, it doesn't have AIDS.
3708880	3709360	Yeah.
3710880	3712960	And now you do, probably.
3712960	3714320	I was picturing you.
3714320	3715680	Unless it was heteronormative sex.
3715840	3717600	People don't want to admit it's a low risk factor.
3717600	3721360	I would say at the end, I love the speed of that one and the anger.
3721360	3722400	It was great.
3722400	3726720	I think the punch line, you have to make it more of a Henny Youngman kind of.
3728320	3733200	I was imagining you like running and crossing the finish line in record time.
3733200	3736240	It was so amazing to see you just run through that.
3736240	3739840	I just don't know why people are so, it's a different kind of talent.
3739840	3742960	Like people that can like, it's like a combination of like semantics,
3742960	3745120	but also like this casualness.
3745120	3748720	Because semantics are so crucial in all these jokes.
3748720	3750480	You could say the wrong thing the wrong way.
3750480	3751760	And it's like so crucial.
3751760	3752880	And I'm just not used to that.
3752880	3756880	Like, I don't, that's not my, like, because every joke you tell,
3756880	3758720	it's like that, like road comic jokes.
3758720	3762160	They're like, it really just come down to like this cadence.
3762160	3764480	And like, oh, if you say this, and then you say that,
3764480	3765600	and you say that in a certain rhythm.
3765600	3769120	And I really don't, I don't, I can't, I always fuck it up.
3769120	3772000	Because it's like the guy's got to say, like, oh.
3772640	3773280	I don't know.
3773280	3774880	Yeah, I can't, I can't read for example.
3774880	3777120	I mean, I'm obsessed with stupid jokes.
3777120	3779280	And I love when people tell me when like the,
3779280	3781440	the reincarnation one is a great joke.
3781440	3784480	The soup one, I remember that.
3784480	3785920	I think that one's pretty basic.
3787120	3792640	There's a guy who goes to, well, he doesn't go to anybody.
3792640	3793280	It's his wife.
3794880	3796800	We're off to a flying start, by the way.
3796800	3797280	I love it.
3797280	3798560	Well, some of this stuff, it's like,
3798560	3802560	if my first draft is too long in the beginning,
3802560	3805200	that doesn't, like, you can just edit that.
3805200	3806480	I mean, not in the podcast.
3806480	3807360	I mean, just whatever.
3807360	3808640	It's not a failure is my point.
3808640	3810240	Like, it's me working something out.
3810240	3812000	Tell me the fucking soup joke.
3812000	3816640	There's a woman that says, goes to a helper in a society.
3816640	3817680	Like, whatever.
3817680	3819680	I don't know if it's like a sex coach or something.
3819680	3821280	Like, I don't know who you'd go to for this.
3823040	3824560	There's a woman that goes to-
3824560	3825280	It's her husband.
3825280	3826720	No.
3828720	3829440	What soup joke are you talking about?
3829440	3831200	No, her husband's going to be there with the punchline.
3831200	3834720	She can't be open with him about her sexual goals.
3834720	3837120	Like, they have to play out in a crazy thing.
3837120	3837840	We'll see if the family's like-
3837840	3838480	Is it a waiter?
3838480	3839760	She goes to-
3839760	3840720	Everyone's heard this joke.
3840720	3844240	She goes to a sexual mentor.
3844240	3845600	I don't know where you went.
3845600	3846800	Is that a therapist?
3846800	3847680	She goes to a sex therapist.
3847680	3848320	Thank you, Nova.
3848320	3849760	It's still a little problematic, I think.
3849760	3856080	It says like, my husband's not having sex with me.
3857120	3859680	I want to encourage that more than discourage it.
3860800	3863840	The therapist says like, why don't you do something like
3864800	3869840	magnificent and adventurous and involving different outfits.
3869840	3874640	And you know, I'm not telling you to doll it up.
3874640	3878640	But at the same time, sometimes just a little distance
3878640	3882160	from the process can like-
3884000	3885280	Last thing I'm going to do is tell you like,
3885280	3886640	you're not hot enough for your husband.
3886640	3891520	I'm just telling you like, maybe sex needs to become adventurous again.
3891520	3893120	It needs to become more of an adventure.
3893120	3894720	This is a fucking four line joke.
3896160	3899680	So then because based on that advice, here's what she does.
3899680	3902560	You're making it harder, but with your jeering.
3903680	3904640	She goes home.
3904640	3907760	It's moving fast enough for almost anybody.
3908160	3910560	You know how long it took for Robocop to become a Robocop?
3912560	3914960	This is a crazier story than that.
3914960	3916240	That guy just got shot.
3916240	3917200	I could say that fast.
3917200	3919040	There's this guy wanting to be a cop.
3919040	3921360	And then he was like too much of a cowboy cop.
3921360	3922560	So he put himself in harm's way,
3922560	3924720	but he didn't know the corporations that were running the cops,
3924720	3928400	like actually were placing high risk candidates in different districts
3928400	3934320	according to their needs for a donor, aka a half dead body.
3934320	3936880	I mean, long story short, this guy's part of like a backup plan,
3936960	3939760	like a pork barrel law enforcement plan with a corporation
3939760	3942160	that really is pumping all their money into this thing called the Ed 209,
3942160	3944720	which is this like urban pacification thing.
3944720	3946480	It's a fucking four line joke.
3947680	3952080	And so our hero who just wants to impress his son based on this show, T.J. Lazer,
3952080	3955200	he ends up in old Detroit and he's like dead or alive, you're coming with me.
3955200	3958640	They shoot his arms and legs off, he ends up Robocop.
3958640	3961840	That's less crazy than this fucking shit with these people.
3961840	3964080	They want to have sex so bad that they get in outfits.
3964160	3967120	Like, I mean, there's nothing wrong with that,
3967120	3970240	but like this woman's just like bent on self destruction.
3970240	3972320	You're doing a bit, you're trying to not go there.
3972320	3977200	She goes home, I'm just telling you this movie would be longer than Robocop.
3977920	3982240	She goes home, she gets into a, I can't use the word
3982240	3986400	because you can't use the punchline, like she gets into an outfit.
3986400	3989360	Like it's got a cape, it's got like a belt, it's got boots.
3990880	3993040	She's like adventure, you got to do adventurous sex
3993040	3994160	because that's what she's thinking.
3994160	3996560	Like, and so then the husband's like in his bed.
4000320	4002720	The husband's in his bed, he's doing a crossword puzzle that night.
4003360	4003840	She...
4005360	4008880	Oh, that becomes important later on in the joke.
4010400	4010880	It does.
4010880	4014640	The fact that he's a crossword enthusiast becomes very important.
4014640	4016480	It's so important, it is important.
4016480	4016720	Okay.
4017520	4018240	It's, he's...
4018240	4020000	Yeah, no, it's the whole joke.
4020000	4021760	The joke is that he's...
4021760	4024320	He doesn't look up from the crossword when he does the punchline.
4024320	4025600	Okay, go ahead.
4029120	4032080	The thing that I'm fucked up though is that why did he...
4032080	4033680	Is she in the closet the whole night?
4033680	4034000	Because...
4034720	4037440	It's a fucking four line joke.
4037440	4038240	It's four...
4038240	4039360	I want to retract some stuff.
4041040	4045200	She earlier was trying the outfit on, so make sure it fits so that he came home
4045200	4046960	and they played Trivial Pursuit.
4046960	4050640	I don't know if you just love talking so much and you hate jokes that much,
4050640	4052400	but are you really trying to get it right?
4052400	4054800	It shouldn't be both, I don't hate talking.
4054800	4055040	Okay.
4055760	4057840	It used to be how I got people like me.
4057840	4058320	All right.
4058320	4060000	Then I started doing this shit.
4060000	4060320	Okay.
4061200	4062400	But that's good, that's good.
4062400	4063200	Take it from the top.
4063200	4064320	I should have to do other stuff.
4064320	4064720	Take it from the top.
4064720	4066000	Don't eat blood?
4066000	4067200	What do you people want?
4068240	4069280	Sorry, I lashed out.
4070080	4073280	The woman tries on the outfit, so just retcon that.
4073280	4076320	Like if it was like Black Orphan or what's that show?
4076320	4077360	Like where you're like...
4077360	4078240	What is it?
4078240	4078960	Orphan Black.
4079920	4081840	I would ask what the fuck you're talking about.
4081840	4083040	You guys haven't seen Black Orphan?
4084720	4085840	Fucking honkies.
4085840	4086320	Yeah, whoa.
4086320	4088400	It's a four fucking sentence joke.
4089600	4092080	You just love your fucking mainstream entertainment.
4092080	4093440	Watch Black Orphan, get back to me.
4095680	4098640	It's fucking badass and it might not be enjoyable for you.
4098640	4101200	Maybe a couple of things you might not want to hear about yourself.
4101200	4111200	Uh, that's funny for reasons no one will understand but me later at home.
4114400	4117200	You just mark spots on the podcast where you're like...
4117200	4117680	Yeah.
4118560	4120800	So she already has this plan.
4120800	4123120	So he comes home, he goes, where's my crossword?
4123120	4124000	She's like, where you left it?
4124000	4124640	He gets in bed.
4124640	4125280	They do the thing.
4125280	4127200	It's like it's going to be a regular stagnant night,
4127200	4128960	but not tonight, not according to her.
4128960	4130000	She's going to do this thing.
4130080	4132240	So she's like, I'm going to go do something.
4132240	4132880	He's like, what are you doing?
4132880	4133840	He's like, I'll tell you in a second.
4133840	4134720	She goes to the closet.
4134720	4135600	They have like a place.
4135600	4138080	It's like a, like there's room in the closet.
4139120	4140080	So she can change.
4140080	4140960	She closes the door.
4140960	4141600	He can't see her.
4141600	4142400	She changes.
4142400	4142880	Fucking blow my brains out.
4142880	4146960	So she comes out of the closet and she's, she's wearing a red cape.
4146960	4148640	She's wearing red boots.
4148640	4150000	She's wearing this whole outfit.
4150000	4153680	I can't refer to the, I can't refer to the costume because it's coming up.
4153680	4157360	If I refer to it, if I describe it in the way that make you go, yeah, I got it.
4157360	4159520	So I have to go through every fucking article of clothing
4159520	4161600	because if I say the wrong word, I ruined the punchline.
4163440	4166400	So she, I have to describe the fucking cape and a thing.
4166400	4167360	She comes out.
4167360	4168720	She's got an S on her fucking.
4168720	4170880	My fucking hell right now.
4170880	4174080	She goes like super pussy.
4174080	4179520	And the, and the husband without looking up from his crossword says, I'll have the soup.
4181120	4183600	Wait, no, he looks at her and then looks back at the crossword
4185680	4187520	because otherwise you'd mistake it for like,
4187520	4192000	he just loves soup and there was a semantic that he looks up from the crossword and it
4192000	4194480	wasn't relevant for him to be a crossword, right?
4196160	4199200	Why is it a crossword because he has to like look at her
4199200	4201920	and then look back at it anyway, an iPad.
4201920	4202560	I don't care.
4202560	4206640	You got to think like a borscht belt, like old school Jewish comic, like a borscht belt.
4209040	4212720	Tells a joke at the speed of light and the details mean nothing.
4212720	4214320	Well, congratulations to them.
4215040	4219360	Thank you for Trump, borscht belt generation.
4219360	4221680	Maybe you should be more detail oriented.
4221680	4225600	An old couple are celebrating their 70th anniversary.
4225600	4227920	The man is in bed reading a paper.
4227920	4232400	The woman wants to spice things up and she ties a towel around her neck, like Superman.
4232400	4235440	And she comes out of the bathroom naked with a towel around her neck and she goes,
4235440	4236480	super pussy.
4236480	4239520	And he looks up from the paper and he says, I'll have the soup.
4239520	4240320	Like that's that.
4240320	4242480	That's how fucking short that joke is.
4243120	4246000	So he wants to do the crossword puzzle.
4246000	4247520	Do you want the thousand questions?
4247520	4248720	Why is it crossword?
4248720	4250640	Why did she think that was going to spice anything up?
4250640	4251440	That's insane.
4251440	4256880	She just seen Superman II because she's a big fan of a big fan of Richard Donner
4256880	4261360	who got fired off of that, even when he wrote the screenplay, but was fired off of it.
4261360	4265040	And Richard Pryor, I believe, or that's three.
4265040	4268880	But if she had a towel around her neck, why would she she probably was like,
4268880	4271120	oh, no, sorry, this isn't to wipe up your soup.
4271120	4271840	I'm not a waiter.
4272480	4280640	Tell the Thor joke, Thor joke, the Thor, Thor walks into a bar and the bartender is like,
4280640	4282800	hey, we don't serve your kind here.
4282800	4285920	And he's like, uh, what kind?
4285920	4291600	I'm a God from Ragnarok from the Rainbow Bridge of like, uh, uh, Elsa guard.
4292240	4299760	And, uh, the bartender's like, the exits are two to the rear and two to the side.
4300000	4301120	Now, don't use those ones.
4302000	4302560	I don't know.
4302560	4302800	No.
4302800	4308080	Why did, uh, what, what, what, uh, it's, uh, why did, uh, how come, how come, uh,
4308080	4309760	how, how come, what, what, why, why?
4311360	4312240	Well, I got, I have it.
4312240	4312640	I have it.
4312640	4313120	I have it.
4313120	4316160	How come, how come, uh, why is, uh, being, uh,
4319840	4325440	why is it, why is it, why is it, why is the, why, why is the job of physical therapy?
4325440	4326400	I'm on meth right now.
4326400	4327680	Yeah.
4327680	4331360	Why is it profitable to become a physical therapist in Asgard?
4331920	4333920	Because a lot of everyone's Thor.
4335600	4339600	Yeah, but they're not all Thor, but you know, they're not all Thor, but
4341600	4343120	but over time I could have figured it out.
4344560	4346000	Is that the Thor joke?
4346000	4347120	I think it was.
4347120	4348080	Not a speech therapist.
4348080	4349280	No, the Thor joke is.
4349280	4354000	No, they're, well, they're, well, yeah, I know that it's not the word sword buddy.
4354000	4358080	You just don't get my comedy and like, I don't know what to tell you.
4361040	4362480	Like it kills at colleges.
4362480	4364960	So like, and those guys read for a living.
4364960	4369440	So you just don't get me mad.
4370400	4373600	You're like watching these Netflix comedy specials and you're like, this is easy,
4373600	4376240	but like, that was a fucking killer joke.
4376240	4379680	Make up a brand new like joke joke, like a dad joke.
4379680	4380960	Wait, what was the Thor joke?
4380960	4387360	Well, an ant walks into a, just say bar, bar.
4388160	4389440	Is the whole joke going to go like that?
4389440	4389840	No.
4389840	4391920	You're going to, you're going to heavy shoulder me.
4391920	4393280	And he just orders a drink.
4393280	4394880	Just say he orders a drink.
4394880	4395360	You pause.
4396080	4398560	I don't know how much longer I'm going to put up with this, but he orders a drink
4399280	4403280	because in the spirit of collaboration and I hope it's inspiring.
4403280	4405520	I've inspired every day.
4405520	4407120	So he orders a drink.
4407120	4408720	Now, just keep in mind, he didn't have to.
4409440	4410400	Yeah.
4410480	4411520	No, he's being very nice.
4411520	4415200	A lot of shit that happens in these bar jokes where the person doesn't even order a drink.
4415200	4419280	Like, for instance, the lobster goes into a bar and he, and the bartender is like,
4419280	4420480	get the fuck out of here.
4421520	4424720	I love that joke that the bartender is just like, get out of here.
4424720	4425520	Get out of here.
4426480	4427120	Lobster.
4429120	4431280	It's funny before the punchline.
4431280	4434240	This is like, this is funny that like a bar, that's it.
4434240	4435360	Get out of here.
4435360	4437040	He's immediately fucked up.
4437680	4439360	And there's like one guy at the bar.
4439360	4442000	That's like, what the fuck was that about the bartender?
4442000	4444400	He's like, that guy, he's always doing this stuff.
4444400	4448000	Wait, I know you fucked it up, but that part doesn't matter.
4448000	4449200	He gives me nothing but this.
4449200	4450400	There's nothing nothing but this.
4450400	4451120	I mean, it's a thing.
4451120	4454320	It's semantics, but it's like, you know, the idea is that he's a lobster and that
4454320	4455840	the bartender has a problem with him doing that.
4455840	4457520	But it's like the lobster does that naturally.
4457520	4461840	That's not like, but I think it's just funnier that the bartender is mad.
4462400	4463120	Get out of here.
4463120	4464160	Get out of here.
4464160	4467760	Yeah, now finish it.
4467760	4468720	Finish your show.
4469520	4470240	Like what?
4470240	4471920	Why be a bartender at that point?
4471920	4473920	Like, like, like, like, whoa.
4473920	4478240	That's like, like, like walking into the bar is going to get you that tightly wound.
4478240	4481920	What kind of bar allows lobsters to walk down the fucking road in the first place?
4481920	4485280	Especially if it turns out that the reason is because he's doing this,
4485280	4486320	which is what a lobsters do.
4486320	4490240	So, so, so like the guy should be like, okay, so so far all I'm hearing is that
4490240	4493040	a lobster sometimes comes into your bar and you've chosen to be
4493040	4495920	like more of a regular bartenders that doesn't have lobsters.
4495920	4497520	Like you got, you got like a bar.
4497520	4501280	I mean, maybe this is a universe where lobsters are like, and men are like, you know,
4502240	4507520	it's like, maybe like what it's like ABC's caveman series where it was like,
4507520	4510560	like, oh, cavemen are like half of society.
4511760	4513440	Remember, it was based on that Geico commercial.
4514240	4514880	It was good.
4514880	4515600	Nick Kroll.
4515600	4516560	Finish the ant joke.
4516560	4518080	So an ant goes into a bar.
4518080	4519200	An ant goes in the bar.
4519200	4522400	And that's why my only point was that I could have chosen for the bartender to be like,
4522400	4523200	get out of here.
4523920	4526720	But you, you made it a bar instead of a dirt mound.
4526720	4527760	You said you had to get a drink.
4528320	4529360	No, my hands are tied.
4529360	4531840	Like, let's, let's, let's tell this amazing joke.
4531840	4534800	Let's erase the shot for an ant goes where?
4535440	4536480	Oh, shit.
4536480	4538400	It goes into a hill of dirt.
4539120	4539920	Okay.
4539920	4543680	Because I'm not afraid of like organic humor.
4543680	4546640	I'm like, it doesn't have to go to a bar.
4546640	4548400	It goes into a, where an ant goes.
4548400	4550880	He goes into one of those hills of dirt that ants make.
4552400	4557120	And he got, and the, and the, the, the guard at the entrance is like,
4557120	4558400	Hey, who goes there?
4558400	4560720	And he's like, it's me, Glenn.
4562480	4565360	And the ant's like, okay, go through.
4566320	4567760	Do you smell any picnics?
4568800	4574480	And the ant, Glenn is like, would I be back?
4576160	4579840	And then, and the guard is like, yeah, for the queen.
4579840	4584160	And Glenn is like, honey.
4589040	4590880	So there's got to be some gay joke there, right?
4592080	4595600	Like something about like, like, he said something sassy, like, like, uh,
4595600	4598880	about like, like, like, I wouldn't go above a hundred and third or something.
4598880	4599280	I don't know.
4600080	4603120	It's kind of, it's like, like a picnic or something like, uh, for the queen.
4603120	4603840	Spencer do it.
4603840	4605520	And then it goes into a bar joke.
4605520	4606720	And that goes into bar.
4606720	4608880	No, I still like the tavern.
4608960	4610480	Keepers like, get out of here.
4612320	4614080	Just cause it's like, you don't want ants.
4617920	4622080	It's just what Dan liked about the lobster joke except applied to ants.
4622080	4623040	It's that easy.
4623040	4623680	Yeah.
4623680	4624080	What is that?
4624080	4624560	What is that?
4626160	4627120	I wasn't trying.
4627120	4628400	You're not going to, you're not going to trick me.
4630400	4633440	Thank you for seeing through Jeff's clever tricks.
4633440	4634160	It's part of bull.
4634160	4635600	Look, I was bullied my whole life.
4635600	4636720	I know what bullies do.
4636720	4638480	They're like, oh, see, he's fucking cool.
4638480	4639280	He combs his hair.
4639280	4642160	I'm like, I'm not going to fucking be mad at a nerd that comes his hair.
4642160	4642320	Yeah.
4642320	4643280	Fucking fascist.
4643840	4645120	It's capitalism.
4645760	4646160	All right.
4646160	4649920	A, uh, a walrus then a walrus.
4649920	4650720	A walrus.
4650720	4651600	Goes into a bar.
4651600	4653200	Goes into a bar.
4653200	4653760	Are you sure?
4654800	4656160	You can pick the venue.
4656160	4657600	A walrus goes into a blank.
4658240	4659360	You get to pick the venue.
4662320	4663360	A walrus.
4663360	4663840	I don't know.
4663840	4667680	I, I, I, you saw how it's like, don't even put me in that area.
4667680	4669200	And I set me up for success.
4670320	4670720	Yeah.
4671440	4673200	Well, but then there is sex happening.
4673200	4674400	A walrus goes into a bar.
4674400	4677440	It's probably easier because a walrus, a whorehouse is like a bar where you,
4677440	4679760	instead of ordering drinks, you order like a sex bar.
4681760	4684000	So if I could get over my fucking.
4684000	4689520	Oh, a walrus walks into a, a walrus walks into a whorehouse and it's like, uh, what, what, uh,
4689520	4689840	okay.
4689840	4695200	Uh, I, I want to have sex, um, and the person's like, whoa, do you have money?
4695520	4701520	And he's like, no, but I have tusks and they're made of ivory.
4701520	4704640	And so they're like, well, we can't, they're attached to you.
4704640	4707520	And he's like, yeah, but how about this?
4708160	4713520	Like, like, if you, if you, if you let me have sex, then I'll cut off one of my tusks
4713520	4716320	and I'll give it to you and they're like, why don't you do that first?
4716320	4717760	And he's like, give me a saw.
4717760	4722320	And they're like, uh, we don't have a saw.
4722400	4723360	We don't have a saw.
4723360	4729200	And he's like, you can buy a saw with the tusk I give you.
4730160	4732720	And they're like, how are you going to give it to us if you don't have a saw?
4732720	4734000	And he's like, you know what?
4734560	4735520	I'm a seal.
4735520	4738000	These are fake and I'm not coming back.
4739920	4745680	And he throws down these like plastic hollow, like Halloween store tusks that he was just
4745680	4748640	like keeping in there and they're like, what are you doing?
4748640	4749840	And he's like, I'm out of here.
4749840	4750880	The joke's finished.
4750880	4753360	And they're like, it's not a joke.
4753360	4754240	I'm a human being.
4754240	4757360	And the seal's like, uh, spoken like a person in a joke.
4758640	4759920	And the seal's just gone.
4759920	4762000	And then this person's like, who am I?
4762880	4766640	And then another person comes up and goes like, can I have sex?
4766640	4769040	And they're like, yeah, everyone can.
4769040	4770400	It's never been that difficult.
4770400	4771520	I don't know what I did wrong.
4771520	4772560	It's my first day here.
4772560	4774400	I've been yelled at three times.
4774400	4775600	This is fucking crazy.
4775600	4777760	I'll admit the first two times were my fault.
4777760	4778800	I can see it that way.
4778800	4779760	I'm new here.
4779760	4781440	However, I'm freaking out.
4781440	4783600	I don't think I should have dropped out of architecture school.
4784800	4787040	And the other person says, you were an architect?
4787040	4787360	Yeah.
4788080	4789120	I mean, I was in school.
4789120	4790240	I wasn't an architect.
4790240	4792080	I'm an architect and I never went to school.
4792720	4793440	What's your name?
4794560	4800320	Frank Lloyd Wright says the person, but the architecture student knows it's not Frank Lloyd
4800320	4800480	Wright.
4800480	4801200	They went to school.
4801200	4803280	They've seen pictures of Frank Lloyd Wright.
4803280	4804400	That's not Frank Lloyd Wright.
4805680	4808480	It's like a guy with like big giant teeth.
4810160	4815120	So the kid that went to architecture school is like, oh, I get it.
4815120	4820800	Like this town is just like filled with people that needlessly disguise themselves as species
4820800	4822240	with like tasks.
4822240	4825200	And they just fuck with people.
4825200	4826400	That explains.
4826400	4830000	It doesn't explain the other fuck ups I had this morning, but I'm like getting it now.
4830720	4833760	And then so they go, all right, Mr. Lloyd Wright.
4833760	4834720	Nice to meet you.
4834720	4835840	Would you like to have sex?
4836480	4837920	Is there anything I can interest you in?
4838880	4844400	And the person that's not Frank Lloyd Wright for sure is like, yeah, do you have anything
4844400	4860080	in a Asian woman with a dress on and a hat?
4863200	4865280	And can the hat be filled with money?
4865600	4871040	And the person's been trained like to never say no.
4872960	4875360	And they go, well, first of all, the answer is yes.
4875360	4880720	It's just a question of how much like we have all that we can get that like how much you're
4880720	4881440	willing to pay.
4881440	4884720	And the Frank Lloyd Wright says, how much money is going to be in the hat?
4885840	4886640	And the person's like,
4890640	4892560	how much money do you want to be in the hat?
4893200	4894880	Because it's like your fantasy, right?
4895280	4896880	Frank Lloyd Wright says a million dollars.
4896880	4898080	I want a million dollars in the hat.
4898880	4903520	And the person's like, okay, that'll be a million dollars in a hundred dollars.
4904960	4907440	Is what that will cost around there.
4907440	4908960	I'm not really authorized to like me.
4908960	4909760	That's an estimate.
4910880	4912080	An estimate?
4912080	4913520	What the fuck am I standing here for?
4915120	4917280	Why am I embarrassing myself having these conversations?
4917280	4920720	Like, I'm like, you can't authorize this transaction?
4921680	4925360	Are you asking me if I'm allowed to put a million dollars in a hat,
4925360	4931280	find a person based on their race, dress them in an outfit, and then no, I'm not.
4933680	4934800	And Frank Lloyd Wright's like,
4936400	4942160	do you realize that when they taught me how to build buildings, I know how to take them apart.
4942880	4945440	And the architecture student's like, you didn't go to school.
4945440	4946000	You said.
4946800	4948960	He's like, I'm talking about my grandpappy.
4951360	4955440	And the student's like, I'm going to go get your Asian woman and your million dollars.
4955440	4956720	I'll be right back.
4956720	4961040	And he goes in the kitchen and he goes to his manager and goes like, I quit.
4963680	4964960	He's had enough at this point.
4964960	4967200	Yeah, I'm out and you can go deal with this.
4967200	4969360	And like, it's been a fucking intense day.
4969360	4971600	And like, I don't want any more to do with this.
4971600	4974720	So the manager goes and like Frank Lloyd Wright's like tapping his foot.
4974720	4975600	It's not Frank Lloyd Wright.
4975600	4981680	Because he thought the job of being a clerk at the front of house,
4981680	4984080	at a whorehouse was going to be a lot easier of a job.
4984080	4985120	His dad's a senator.
4985120	4987120	He's like, you should work at the whorehouse.
4987120	4990960	Like that way people come in, they get herpes, they get whores.
4991760	4992480	It's a win-win.
4992480	4993600	Like you've got something on people.
4993600	4994720	That's how I became a senator.
4994720	4996320	That's how you're going to become a senator.
4996320	4998800	Like you got to work around where the fucking's happening.
4998800	5000560	Like this is America.
5000560	5002080	You know when they say make America great again?
5002080	5003360	This is when America was great.
5005760	5007760	So finally, he's at a breaking point.
5007760	5010320	And he goes to his boss and says, I quit.
5010320	5010880	I quit.
5010880	5011600	Manager goes out.
5011600	5014000	Frank Lloyd Wright is not Frank Lloyd Wright and is out there.
5014000	5014800	He's like tapping his foot.
5014800	5016080	He's looking at the goldfish in the bowl.
5016080	5017840	He's like looking at the grandfather clock.
5017840	5022080	He's like pacing and the manager's like, are you OK?
5022080	5024640	And Frank Lloyd is like the guy that isn't Frank Lloyd Wright.
5024640	5026720	He's like, yeah, no.
5028960	5034000	And this whole argument happens in like the long story short is
5034960	5036800	like the whorehouse closes.
5036800	5038800	It's out of business because it's just like what the guy,
5038800	5040080	the guy wasn't Frank Lloyd Wright,
5040080	5042720	but he was like a like a media magnate.
5042720	5043680	Is that what you call him?
5043680	5043920	Sure.
5043920	5045200	Like a kind of a Hearst figure.
5045200	5046080	Gotcha.
5046080	5048480	And so basically controls the media at that time.
5048480	5048800	Right.
5048800	5050640	And like it just just puts a bunch of mess up.
5050640	5051760	He was trying to do a scam.
5051760	5052800	Yeah, I don't know if he caught on,
5052800	5056080	but like he wanted he thought he could get a million dollars this way.
5056080	5059200	And like even if he put the hundred down up front,
5059200	5061440	like it was like he had this whole thing.
5061440	5062560	He was going to rob.
5062560	5063760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5063840	5064400	Right.
5064400	5067440	So he overestimated how much money you're allowed to have in a place
5067440	5069760	like that and like what the kids authorized to do.
5069760	5070560	And he just basically,
5070560	5073360	but he was so humiliated that he basically bankrupted himself
5073360	5075280	in his newspaper, putting the whorehouse out of business.
5075280	5076960	That's an entire town collapsed.
5076960	5080080	They no longer had any literacy or
5081760	5082320	hedonism.
5082880	5085200	It was basically a barber and a train station there.
5085200	5088080	Like if you were like that freaked out about getting a haircut,
5088080	5089600	there was no way you're going to come to this town.
5089600	5092960	That's how a fantasy island ended.
5092960	5093200	Yeah.
5095520	5096800	So I'm sorry.
5096800	5101040	There's no punch line, but the truth is sometimes life gets pretty ugly.
5102320	5106640	You can't just go into a whorehouse and have a crazy animal encounter.
5106640	5111440	Like these people have lives and we all exist as part of one web.
5111440	5116560	You know, when that when that whorehouse dissolved, it's a corporation.
5117280	5119280	They like, how does that go down?
5120640	5121920	Well, they were insolvent.
5122480	5122640	Yeah.
5123440	5126160	I mean, it was already a quasi legal business.
5126160	5132000	This was just happening at the at like the at the vanguard of a manifest destiny.
5132000	5134880	Like it was just like you're out there in an unincorporated city
5134880	5136080	in the middle of some territory.
5136080	5137520	No one knows what's going on.
5137520	5141440	And it's just like sex was a business and, you know, shit rolls downhill.
5141440	5141760	Sure.
5141760	5142640	They sell you the dream.
5142640	5145280	Like, oh, you can you can anybody can become rich.
5145280	5149920	But it's like what they really mean is like anybody can, you know, die.
5149920	5151760	Like everything's everything has a price on it.
5151760	5155360	Like human life is worth less than a bullet, man.
5155360	5159680	And what happened to the guy that wanted to go in there for the encounter?
5159680	5160880	The newspaper man?
5160880	5161280	Yeah.
5161280	5162160	Oh, he died.
5162160	5163760	He his newspaper went out of business.
5163760	5164640	His newspaper went out of business.
5164640	5167360	He ended up a prospector and he got claim jumped.
5168160	5169120	Holy shit.
5169680	5169920	Yeah.
5170800	5172320	He didn't even have a claim.
5172320	5173120	He was trying to.
5173120	5175680	He's trying to do like the guy you met the guy in this joke,
5175680	5176880	which wasn't a joke, by the way.
5178640	5180080	He was what he was trying to do with it.
5180080	5182400	He just like he went he took that he didn't learn his lesson.
5182400	5185600	He's like he's like he would he he decided he was going to become rich
5185600	5189360	by pretending that he found gold and saying, I found gold.
5189360	5192480	Does anybody have any money to I can turn it into silver or something?
5192480	5194160	Do you think they just they just beat him over the head?
5194160	5198000	Do you think before he went into that whore house and asked for a horror
5198000	5201200	with a million dollars in her hat, do you think he had successfully
5201200	5203200	pulled that off in his mind?
5203200	5207200	Yeah, but he was born rich and like so he basically like lied to like
5207920	5211200	guidance counselors, people on his dad's payroll.
5211200	5214400	Like he didn't he mistook like being privileged for being crafty.
5214400	5214960	Right.
5214960	5219280	Like it's like try getting away with the shit that this guy this non frankly.
5219280	5222720	What kind of whore house is also carrying around a million in cash?
5222720	5226800	Ask a fucking dipshit son of a billionaire that like walks in and like tries to do that.
5226800	5230240	Like the guy who's just he could have stayed at home and sucked on his dad's titty.
5231760	5233760	But oh, that wouldn't have suited his ego.
5233760	5234560	Oh, I got to go.
5234560	5235120	I got to go out.
5235120	5236320	I'm going to go tame the wild.
5236400	5239600	I'm going to go build people out of their money and like write a book about it.
5239600	5240400	Yeah, dumb.
5240400	5242000	He traveled only by hot air balloon.
5242000	5243520	He was a terrible person.
5243520	5247280	It's just like he just exuded everything that was wrong with the American dream.
5248080	5249440	And colonialism.
5249440	5250960	This is 1915.
5250960	5251920	1915.
5251920	5252400	Okay.
5252400	5252560	Yeah.
5253360	5253680	Yeah.
5253680	5254640	And he traveled by.
5254640	5256560	Barnaby Johnson was his name.
5256560	5257440	Barnaby Johnson.
5258240	5259600	He caused World War One.
5259600	5260160	He caused it.
5260800	5262480	He caused it a year after it started.
5263520	5264000	Yeah.
5264000	5264240	Okay.
5264640	5265140	Okay.
5266000	5268560	He made people think it started earlier than it did.
5268560	5269360	Yeah.
5269360	5272640	World War One was essentially like a resolvable skirmish.
5272640	5275040	Tell me what you think was the worst moment.
5275040	5277600	And I want you to be specific about World War One.
5277600	5280080	What do you think was the darkest hour?
5280720	5281200	Okay.
5281200	5282960	I got to go to Verdun, bro.
5282960	5283360	Yeah.
5283360	5284160	Yeah.
5284160	5284320	Yeah.
5284320	5284800	Break it down.
5284800	5284960	Right.
5284960	5285680	Everybody knows.
5285680	5287280	Verdun is in what country?
5288080	5289040	Obviously France.
5290400	5291360	Wait, but like what?
5291360	5293120	Hey, what country was which?
5293120	5293920	Why were they fighting?
5294240	5295520	Who knows where that was?
5296560	5300160	They thought they were going to change the answer with their trenches, buddy.
5300160	5305360	And their mustard gas, and they invented the water balloon, and the fucking torture.
5306320	5310880	This is the only war where it started on horseback and it ended in a balloon.
5313360	5315680	And that's where our whorehouse entrepreneur...
5316640	5318320	Whorehouse is financed World War One.
5319360	5321040	They called them the silent generation.
5321040	5322560	The people that went to fight.
5322560	5326320	The mustard gas made them quiet, and they had to eat rats,
5326320	5330800	and they wore hats that looked like pie tins, and they were just like...
5330800	5332000	Pink Floyd sung about them.
5333840	5337760	Everybody had a rifle, and everything was muddy and gross,
5337760	5342080	and the boots were like up to your calf, and it's just a bad scene, brother.
5342080	5344560	What's your opinions on the War of 1812?
5345520	5346720	What a misunderstanding.
5347760	5350720	The war that traveled faster than the telegraph.
5350720	5351600	Let me tell you that.
5353280	5355840	Boy, that war could have been...
5355840	5359280	We could have saved ourselves a war if we had had a telephone back then telling you...
5361920	5364320	That was a war of misunderstanding, they called it.
5364320	5365680	The War of 1812.
5365680	5367520	The Canadians burnt down the White House.
5372080	5374160	I know more than the president, and I'm an idiot.
5376320	5379760	Yeah, I can name half of our Supreme Court justices,
5379760	5381440	but I know all the words to baby got back.
5383360	5385360	What's your...
5386960	5390240	What war, Dan, do you think you know the most about?
5391680	5393680	Vietnam, for sure, because, you know...
5394560	5395840	Because you were in the ship.
5395840	5396320	Yeah.
5399520	5402400	You were a lieutenant in Da Nang.
5402400	5402900	Yeah.
5404320	5406000	Okay, so, all right.
5407120	5408000	They don't want to talk about it.
5408000	5409760	Well, I don't, you know, it doesn't seem like it's...
5409760	5411200	They don't like to talk about it.
5411200	5412160	That's a real soldier.
5412320	5414000	It feels like I'm at a dentist.
5414000	5415120	Because they were there, yeah.
5418960	5422800	Coyotes, so I saw the coyote.
5422800	5426240	I saw a coyote from the brambles behind my house.
5426960	5430560	Yeah, is that the neighbor's yard, or is that a no man's land?
5430560	5432880	I think it's, well, I think it's one of those two.
5432880	5436240	I don't think there's any scenario in which it's my property.
5436240	5440400	Right, but I just like, because I could climb up there and start hacking,
5440400	5444800	but I think there's no partition leading into the neighbor's yard.
5444800	5446960	I don't think you should do that, because that's got to be...
5448000	5450720	We have reason to suspect that that's the neighbor's property.
5451920	5457200	I think what we need to do is, I don't know what the first step is,
5457200	5459280	because what we can't do is call the city.
5459280	5461600	Because we know that if you call the city, they will say,
5462320	5464720	we don't do that anymore, you're on your own.
5464720	5468560	And there's like companies, which evokes like Blackwater,
5468560	5472400	that will come or put the hurt on your coyotes.
5473520	5480720	And all I know is, as the Barack Obama of this coyote problem,
5481360	5485760	that future will judge me, whether I acted or didn't act,
5485760	5487840	and that I don't need to be decisive.
5487840	5491280	I'm not saying, slaughter the coyotes, or put...
5491280	5495920	I demand this, but I'm saying, I think that neighbor,
5495920	5503040	whose territory borders mine, I think that it's possible that the pug,
5503680	5507520	the elderly pug that twice has fallen into my yard...
5507520	5509360	I think that dog died.
5509360	5513760	I mean, if it didn't get eaten by coyotes, it died of old age, because...
5513760	5515680	I think it died from falling.
5515680	5517360	Well, I mean, yeah, it couldn't be...
5518720	5522400	And my dogs are so sweet, they would guard it, and they were nice to it.
5522400	5525440	They're like, oh, a dog fell in our yard, and they would take care of it,
5525440	5530000	and then both times, once my ex-wife, Erin McGathey,
5530000	5533680	and once my dog, Sitter Allison, I was never here for these two events,
5533680	5538800	but it happens twice, and both times, one of those two characters...
5539440	5540560	They're not characters, they're human beings.
5541360	5542160	They're human beings.
5542160	5542960	They're not characters.
5542960	5544080	God damn it, Harmon.
5544640	5545520	Never let it slip.
5547680	5550160	Don't let them know they're all in your story.
5552080	5555360	If they realize it, they can end the book.
5555680	5557760	I've met them both, and they're real characters.
5559120	5560800	He meant that they're kind of like...
5561680	5562640	Characters.
5562640	5563280	That's my...
5565120	5566080	You mean humans?
5567120	5568480	You forgot the word for human.
5570160	5572560	But you don't just call people humans, they just sound like an alien.
5574000	5574560	I don't know.
5576160	5576720	People.
5576720	5581920	People sounds like, you know, word peoples, like both of these people.
5581920	5582960	You mean your ex-wife?
5584000	5585120	What do you mean, you people?
5585360	5586080	It's your ex-wife.
5587360	5588400	I don't know what you're saying.
5588400	5589600	She was a real character.
5589600	5590560	She was a real character.
5590560	5593200	How do you refer to a group of people who have one's your ex-wife
5593200	5594880	and one's your dog's name?
5594880	5595600	Those people.
5600160	5600800	Women?
5600800	5602960	No, that would be crazy.
5602960	5604160	Both of those women.
5604160	5605040	That would be weird.
5606080	5608880	I mean, thank you for continuing to prove that I was right
5608880	5612400	and being hung up on that and barfed out the word character,
5612400	5614000	and then was like, what are you, Doctor Who?
5614960	5619840	Anyways, so, like, they took the dog up the hill
5619840	5622000	and they found the owner of that territory.
5622000	5623920	I live in these windy hills,
5623920	5627120	so it's like, for instance, my neighbor, the bootsins,
5627120	5629120	who we've met on this show several times,
5629120	5632240	if I go over to their house for a party, and I do...
5634240	5639920	Hollywood, I actually have to either climb over a fence,
5639920	5642000	which actually almost makes more sense.
5642000	5643680	It's kind of weirder what I have to do
5643680	5644960	if I don't want to climb over a fence,
5644960	5649200	which is I have to walk with Cody a whole block
5649200	5651520	because their house is right next door to mine,
5651520	5653120	but their address is on a completely different street.
5653120	5654240	And the fence isn't that high.
5654240	5655680	It's like hip-hop.
5655680	5657120	Yeah, and I was telling them last time,
5657120	5660000	we've got to make a gate in this fence,
5660000	5661600	because also we're living in the end times,
5661600	5665840	so there's going to be a weird ice agent showing up
5665840	5670400	and going, I understand you have the people in your floorboards,
5670400	5672560	and we're going to want to have tunnels
5672560	5675520	in our fucking rich, liberal neighborhood,
5675520	5677600	and arsenic to put in their tea.
5677600	5679120	Oh, please come in, yes.
5680240	5684320	I was just telling my housekeeper how American we all are.
5685120	5686720	More chamomile?
5689760	5693760	Ah, yes, I like your community show, huh?
5693760	5694260	Yes?
5695520	5697920	Wish there was less black people in it?
5697920	5701680	I liked the Yahoo season when they all quit.
5704320	5704960	I don't know.
5704960	5706240	Glover is kaboot.
5706240	5707680	I ain't nine.
5707680	5708640	Not nine, duh.
5710240	5711280	I got you, yeah.
5712560	5713440	I'm so blue.
5714240	5717360	I'm turning blue because I poisoned you, Nazi.
5718640	5719040	What?
5719040	5719520	Why?
5719520	5720320	You're so white.
5721120	5722480	Because I'm a good white guy.
5723040	5724640	I hate fucking Nazis, bro.
5724640	5728320	Because I'm fucking raised by fucking real Americans.
5728320	5729360	We hate fucking Nazis.
5729360	5733040	That's just a thing you made up after you got into the war
5733040	5733680	for a profit.
5734640	5735200	Oh, come on.
5735200	5736960	Don't be so fucking cynical, you prick.
5737920	5738160	Come on.
5738160	5741120	We went to war with you fucking dude.
5741120	5742400	You were going to say cocksucker.
5742960	5743200	See?
5743200	5745440	Because you're fucking, you're a Nazi.
5745440	5746160	Yeah, you wish.
5746800	5747600	It's different.
5747600	5749440	You just want everybody to mistrust themselves
5749440	5752160	and you're fucking, I'm going to watch you die.
5752160	5753600	I'm going to spit on you while you die
5753600	5755600	with your fucking dumb eagle medals.
5757200	5759040	Oh, I love my eagle medals.
5760960	5762640	Stupid skull on your hat.
5762640	5763680	You look so dumb.
5765520	5766000	Hate you.
5767920	5769600	You know why you hate me, right?
5770240	5770720	Yeah, what?
5770720	5771360	What are you going to tell me?
5771360	5772560	We're not so different.
5772560	5774720	Then how come you're dying and I made you tea?
5776560	5778800	You see me in a fucking eagle hat?
5778800	5779840	We're not so different.
5779840	5780160	Go ahead.
5780160	5782080	Do your monologue purple, dying Nazi.
5784400	5792800	You hate me because you secretly wish you for one moment
5792800	5797920	of your life could feel the, having one or two Emmys?
5800400	5801120	What?
5801120	5801840	You want two?
5803440	5803680	What?
5803680	5804640	One for community?
5805280	5807200	No, I never won one for community.
5807200	5808560	But it was such a good show.
5808560	5810400	Yeah, you're making my point.
5810640	5817040	People who are proud of their race are coming to the conversation
5817040	5819280	saying, I have nothing to be proud of.
5819280	5821360	If you were talented, you wouldn't be a Nazi.
5821360	5822320	I'm tired.
5822320	5823520	I'm killing myself.
5823520	5827280	I can't listen to another fucking episode of your bullshit.
5827920	5830240	You're fucking crazy with your ranting.
5830240	5832560	It ruined your podcast when Trump got elected.
5833760	5834720	I thought you loved him.
5834720	5837760	I do, but I don't want to listen to you blather about it.
5837760	5838800	Oh, you shot himself.
5840400	5841440	Bing bong.
5841440	5841840	Fuck.
5841840	5842320	Shit.
5842320	5842720	Hello.
5843440	5844000	Hello.
5844000	5845280	Sorry to bug you.
5845280	5848080	We're the Nazi supervisors.
5848080	5855200	And we sent a Nazi over to harangue and have tea.
5855200	5857920	And he'd spend more than 20 minutes.
5857920	5859200	And I really don't want to.
5859200	5860240	I saw the address.
5860240	5861840	I'm like, Rick and Morty, I love.
5863440	5863920	Oh, no, no.
5863920	5865440	Yeah, he just shot himself.
5865440	5866800	What a shy saw.
5868880	5869760	What's that mean?
5869760	5870240	Shit.
5870240	5870880	Oh, OK.
5871680	5872800	Oh, shit.
5872800	5873440	FICA.
5874400	5874880	FICA.
5876240	5878640	Isn't that what they take out of your paycheck?
5878640	5880000	Move out of my way.
5881760	5883200	Oh, Hans.
5884320	5885760	Why did he do it?
5885760	5888560	He said he loved Jews.
5894800	5896560	Is that all he said?
5896560	5898080	Why would he say that to you?
5899840	5900640	I don't know.
5900640	5902800	Dude, you guys are complicated.
5902800	5903520	What are you going to tell me?
5903520	5904560	You all go to therapy?
5904560	5905520	He was fucked up.
5907280	5908480	That gets to the bone.
5909520	5911280	I'm a big fan of your work.
5911280	5911680	I know.
5912720	5914800	I'm not just a Rick and Morty fan.
5914800	5916720	I also have read your blog.
5918400	5919840	I've followed you my whole life.
5920960	5923280	And although you've had your ups and downs,
5924880	5928480	you're sort of window into the complexity of.
5930480	5931520	Mathema chickens.
5936320	5938400	By the way, where is Jeff Davis?
5939280	5940560	Oh, he lives close by.
5941760	5942320	Knock, knock.
5942320	5942880	Oh, shit.
5942880	5943360	It's Jeff.
5944240	5945600	Maybe the Zeppelin dropped him off.
5945600	5947120	Hey, Dan, what's going on?
5947120	5948560	Jeff, there's Nazis here.
5948560	5949200	Oh, shit.
5949200	5950640	One of them killed themselves.
5950640	5951680	OK, wow.
5951680	5952720	And the other one came to pick them up,
5952720	5953440	and everything's fine.
5953440	5954640	This seems like a bad time.
5955600	5957120	No, it's the best time.
5957120	5959440	I mean, it's not as good as when America was great.
5959760	5963200	Which you will never pin me down on when that was.
5964000	5965040	I just want it again.
5965600	5967760	You know, like when I was 10.
5967760	5969840	Like when the Muppets were syndicated.
5971200	5973200	Make America great again.
5974480	5978480	I like it to be great again before I met a black person.
5979040	5982800	I can see by the insignia on your lapel that you're a Colonel.
5982800	5987440	I'm a Colonel First Class Yeti edition.
5987440	5988720	Super special forces.
5990400	5992240	Secret double-tier platinum.
5993840	5994720	Double bead.
5996880	5998160	Through line.
5998160	5999680	Double strength.
5999680	6001520	Titanium fully crazed.
6001520	6004320	Commander of the ultimate death platoon.
6005280	6006560	A fucking like million.
6006560	6009120	I had to kill like a million homeless people.
6009120	6011680	Hey, Dan, do you have any bears in the fridge?
6011680	6012560	Yeah, there's Grohl.
6014800	6016000	Because when in Rome.
6016000	6016560	Yeah, OK.
6016560	6018320	I open the fridge.
6018400	6022880	So anyways, when did you go from being in ice to being a full-blown German soldier?
6024880	6029600	That just, it's like a Christopher Durang, like a mystical realism.
6029600	6032160	Kind of like I just became just a general Nazi.
6033840	6035520	You know why Hitler killed himself, right?
6036880	6038880	He was an angry drunk.
6038880	6039380	No.
6040480	6041520	That's why you stopped drinking.
6042640	6043680	Which I never understood that.
6043680	6044720	Do you know why he killed himself?
6045840	6046400	Gas bill.
6046400	6046640	Gas bill.
6047600	6050560	So I don't like the joke.
6050560	6051200	I don't like the joke.
6051200	6054480	And I'll tell you why kids trivializes victims.
6055680	6056480	It's a great joke.
6057440	6058640	It's not a great joke.
6058640	6061440	It's not a great joke because it's like, oh yeah, he gassed a lot of people.
6061440	6063600	But it's like, you know what?
6064960	6066800	The only way, it wouldn't make it a better joke.
6066800	6071680	But he saw his gas bill and it had all the names of all the victims.
6071680	6072560	And here are their names.
6074960	6075600	Why is that better?
6075680	6077520	Six million names later.
6077520	6080400	It's still not a funny joke, but at least you're a good person.
6081040	6085200	Because it's like, yeah, those are the people that aren't laughing.
6085920	6086800	They couldn't join us.
6087520	6091520	You know how he tied his shoes in little Nazis.
6092800	6094800	See, that's adorable.
6094800	6097440	Because when Hitler's like Dracula, that's when it's funny.
6097440	6102640	When it's like, oh, why does he like the radio?
6102640	6104720	Because he likes us to the Hitlers.
6105520	6106960	I can't do it.
6106960	6107600	I can't riff it.
6107600	6108000	All right.
6108000	6109040	That's why some of the stuff's joke.
6109040	6111360	Don't get mad at me for failing to do a Hitler joke.
6111360	6112080	You're bad people.
6113840	6115200	How come your Hitler jokes aren't better?
6116160	6118240	Wait, so because I'm a good person.
6118240	6125760	Why are the IS people actually like full-blown Nazis in the situation?
6125760	6126000	Oh, yeah.
6126000	6131120	Well, I asked the same question, but the answer is why did Robin Williams' head
6131120	6134160	float in the Baron Munchausen?
6134160	6136480	Because Terry Gilliam's like, hey, come on.
6136480	6137600	Because he was an angry drunk.
6141040	6141760	Anyways.
6141760	6144720	You know that Stalin joke with the capitalism?
6144720	6146400	You could do that with the DSA.
6146400	6147680	It'd be like more modern.
6148560	6152480	You know, it's like, why does the DSA only spelled in lowercase or something?
6152480	6153040	Right.
6153040	6153280	Yeah.
6154080	6156400	Just thought I'd circle back around for that.
6156400	6157040	I like it.
6158080	6161760	They might send you 10,000 tweets, though.
6161760	6162640	No, they'll love it.
6162640	6165680	They'll be like, holy shit, go on Chappo.
6165680	6166960	They love saying that.
6166960	6167200	Yeah.
6167200	6170880	They love to drag your fat ass and then tell you to go on Chappo.
6170880	6173040	They love dragging fat asses.
6173040	6178800	I got that treatment because I made a joke about how it's funny that McDonald's ended up
6179680	6185120	suffering for not licensing Rick and Morty, but still trying to do a Rick and Morty thing
6185120	6185920	with the Sash Munchausen.
6185920	6188320	It's like, yeah, I made one joke about it.
6188320	6190880	I was just like, oh, I've told that story.
6191440	6192880	That was the worst day of my Twitter life.
6192880	6194160	And it wasn't the day I quit Twitter.
6194160	6196560	It was just like, I was like, walked into this thing.
6196560	6199760	I had no idea the world had changed that fucking much.
6199760	6200720	That much was at stake.
6200720	6204960	I was like, I thought you could safely make a joke about how McDonald's sucks
6204960	6206560	for like being a corporation.
6206560	6212320	And like, who cares if they have a bad day at the hands of the worst fans of this show?
6212960	6214080	Who cares?
6214080	6216400	And then it was like one person was like, you know, it's kind of fucked up.
6216400	6217760	Like some people work at McDonald's.
6217760	6218880	It didn't identify themselves.
6219040	6223360	I was like, it's just a rip off of Back to the Future.
6223360	6223760	Fuck you.
6223760	6228640	Why should McDonald's have to pay for your property if you rip off Back to the Future?
6228640	6233840	And his Twitter icon was him in a Rick fucking costume with green things on his lip.
6233840	6236640	And I said, you got some flux capacitor on your fucking lip there,
6236640	6237920	like Mr.
6237920	6239680	Fucking property manager.
6239680	6241040	And he's like, okay, here's the thing.
6241040	6242000	I work at McDonald's.
6242000	6244560	And I'm like, I said some shit to him.
6244560	6247760	And then it was like, there were socialists watching me yell at him
6247840	6250720	where I was like, because it took like hours for the kid to just go.
6250720	6252320	I was a cashier at McDonald's.
6252320	6254960	And I feel like a piece of shit because I work for McDonald's.
6254960	6258000	And I don't want a bunch of fucking weird incels jumping up on counters,
6258000	6259280	yelling at me because I don't know.
6259280	6260800	It's Szechuan sauce from your fucking show.
6260800	6262480	And I was basically like, yeah.
6262480	6265520	So it took you all that fucking time to just say like,
6265520	6267840	you have a fucking agenda in the conversation.
6267840	6269360	I don't have a fucking agenda.
6269360	6270640	I'm just hanging out going.
6270640	6272880	I think it's funny that this corporation didn't pay for this.
6272880	6274320	I can afford to laugh.
6274320	6276000	You're just fucking like doing this shit.
6276000	6278720	And then it got all like, there's always, hey, everybody.
6278720	6283760	Dan Harmon's doing an edgelord rant against a socialist that just wants minimum wage.
6283760	6285280	And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
6286000	6287680	I hate everyone.
6287680	6288320	That's fun.
6288320	6289520	I now hate everyone.
6289520	6290480	I hate my fans.
6290480	6292160	I hate the minimum wage workers.
6293120	6294080	Who else can I hate?
6295120	6296400	I hate rich people.
6296400	6297200	I am one.
6297200	6298480	Now I hate myself.
6298480	6304080	I'm just going to crawl into a fucking shell and have a great life.
6304080	6308640	Hey, Spencer, do you have character sheets?
6308640	6309200	Yeah, yeah.
6309200	6309840	Oh, come on.
6310400	6313920	I mean, I love to play D&D, but you add it.
6313920	6315280	Your message is fuck you.
6316240	6318000	You're doing a bad podcast, Dan Harmon.
6318000	6319840	No, my message is we have 15 minutes left.
6319840	6325040	And I would like to play a fast lightning round of combat with me and you.
6325040	6325760	And I'm Chad.
6325760	6327120	Are you going to shoot each other?
6327120	6327440	Huh?
6327440	6327920	Yeah.
6330400	6331200	You want to fight me?
6331200	6332560	You're going to fight each other.
6332560	6333920	You and I are in a dungeon.
6334160	6335440	We're in a combat round.
6336400	6336800	Yeah.
6336800	6338160	So you are going to fight each other.
6338160	6340720	I thought you were like a Milwaukee friend that was like, come on,
6340720	6341840	let's wrestle in the front yard.
6341840	6343440	Like, I just told me that you're jealous.
6343440	6344320	Also, it's been so long.
6344320	6345360	I've forgotten your character.
6346240	6347760	I've forgotten your character's name, Dan.
6347760	6348640	It's been that long.
6348640	6348960	Yeah.
6348960	6350560	Well, yeah, I don't know where I mean.
6350560	6351280	What's your character?
6352400	6352960	I don't know.
6355840	6357920	Spencer, what's Dan's character called?
6357920	6358800	I'm saying it.
6358800	6359360	Or audience?
6360800	6362400	Oh, Carlos, the unimaginative.
6362400	6363760	And I'm Chad the Firelacker.
6363760	6366480	I have a story that I can jam into a real short thing,
6366480	6374480	because I was looking for a microphone for my iPad Pro
6374480	6376960	so I could sing a song into my iPad Pro.
6377760	6379680	And I was looking for a microphone,
6379680	6383760	because it was a bunch of Michigan guys.
6383760	6385520	They got a USB-C port or whatever.
6385520	6387760	It's like, oh, you got to have a thing.
6387760	6390560	I was searching through my closet for a microphone.
6390560	6392080	And I was like, god damn it, where's that fucking?
6392080	6393680	I think I had an XLR thing.
6393680	6396400	It's been years since I dabbled in any of this shit.
6396400	6396960	Where is this thing?
6396960	6397920	And I'm getting real frustrated.
6397920	6401840	And I find this unopened package that was a citronella dog collar.
6402480	6407600	It was like anti-barking collar that I had bought from Amazon,
6407600	6408880	I think maybe in some fit.
6409680	6411360	And I never opened it.
6411360	6412240	And I was looking at it.
6412240	6413040	It's covered in dust.
6413040	6416400	And I was like, aw, anti-barking collar.
6416400	6419520	And there's a picture on the package of a dog that's like...
6422640	6425760	He's like, yeah, what's he going to do?
6425760	6426640	He looks contrite.
6428400	6430560	You can tell from his eyes that a mailman's near him,
6430560	6431840	but he's like, there he is again.
6433040	6435360	Last time, I don't hear anything from me about it.
6436480	6439280	And I was like, shit, man, Harvey barks a lot.
6440160	6441040	He's always barking.
6441040	6442160	He's a fucking loud dog.
6442160	6443520	He barks at other dogs.
6443520	6444560	He barks at everybody.
6444560	6446800	And then I was like, dude, you're looking for a microphone.
6446800	6451680	That's what I was like when I was listening to this story.
6452880	6454080	I was like, yeah.
6454080	6454320	Yeah.
6454320	6455360	What about the microphone?
6455360	6455920	Exactly.
6455920	6456560	I bark.
6457440	6458640	Harvey doesn't have a podcast.
6458640	6459600	Harvey doesn't...
6459600	6460880	I'm barking all the time.
6461440	6462080	Harvey's just like...
6462080	6463360	He's got one mode of expression.
6464240	6465440	And if you're listening and you're like,
6465440	6469200	I have a citronella collar for my dog, I'm not high-roading you at all.
6470320	6472080	I live in a...
6472080	6473520	Harvey barking doesn't...
6473520	6474880	It's not hurting anybody.
6474880	6480400	It annoys me, but it's not like anybody else is complaining about it or whatever.
6480400	6483440	If you live in an apartment and you got a dog and you used a citronella collar,
6483440	6484000	that seems like...
6485120	6486400	I'm not gonna be one of those people.
6487040	6488320	That's not the point of my story.
6488320	6489600	But I was like, Harvey's just like...
6489600	6491360	He has his own little podcast.
6492080	6492880	He comes to bark.
6493840	6494960	He doesn't even have thumbs.
6494960	6498960	He just has little legs that carry him from one place where he can bark to another.
6498960	6501360	And then today, I was sort of like...
6501920	6506160	Because I felt that way, I watched him play with the next-door neighbor dog.
6506160	6508400	And then there was a neighbor walking his dogs.
6508400	6510720	And I said to Harvey, I was like,
6510720	6512160	Buddy, there's some dogs over there.
6512160	6513520	Don't you wanna bark at him?
6513520	6514640	Because he wasn't even barking at him.
6514640	6515920	He wanted to fetch a ball.
6515920	6518160	And I was like, I don't think you saw those dogs though.
6518160	6519360	And he saw him and he's like,
6520560	6522960	And the neighbor waved at me and I was like, yay.
6523600	6527200	And then Harvey finished barking and I was like, good job.
6528160	6530000	And it was like the same stuff happened,
6530000	6531920	except I wasn't like miserable about it.
6531920	6534160	Because I wasn't like, oh, he's not supposed to do that.
6535360	6537040	You know, it's just his podcast.
6542320	6543840	What are we doing?
6545920	6547040	You're in a dungeon?
6547040	6547920	Is that what you wanted?
6547920	6549200	What were you saying?
6549200	6550560	We only have like 10 minutes.
6550560	6553600	Let's just throw us into the fire right now.
6553600	6554560	Well, yeah.
6554560	6555360	Okay.
6555600	6558000	Dan, are you ready to Carlos this up?
6560640	6562480	None of you guys know what's going on.
6564080	6565200	I thought the last thing I said was,
6565200	6566720	let's go make a potato farm.
6566720	6569120	I was like, let this guy work on Harmon Quest.
6572160	6572640	What is that?
6576800	6581920	Wait, so can we just play like a lightning round of D&D?
6581920	6583920	Yeah, but Steve plays.
6583920	6584880	That's part of it.
6584960	6585760	Is Levy here?
6585760	6586480	I don't know.
6586480	6586960	Levy.
6588720	6591200	I, Levy, Steve Levy, everybody.
6591200	6592240	Steve Levy.
6600640	6601680	What's happening?
6603120	6605680	What have you done since I talked to you about the coyotes?
6608080	6610960	I did a quick search online if there was an organization
6610960	6613040	or a person who handles anything like that.
6613680	6615440	Here comes the Christopher Walken character
6615440	6617200	in this Adam Sandler movie.
6617200	6618480	Didn't seem like there is.
6618480	6621520	I'm here to take care of your coyotes.
6622080	6622400	Sorry.
6624400	6626320	I don't think there's a person for that.
6626320	6626400	You sure want to play D&D?
6626400	6628160	You don't want to do the scene of Christopher Walken
6628160	6629520	showing up to take care of my coyotes?
6629520	6630880	Why don't you want to play D&D?
6630880	6631760	I'd love to, hey.
6633760	6634960	I distracted him.
6634960	6636720	Knock, knock, knock.
6636720	6637200	Why?
6637200	6638960	Who's there?
6638960	6639200	Me.
6640480	6641040	Me who?
6641040	6642160	Why is this happening?
6642240	6643040	I'll start over.
6644720	6645360	Knock, knock.
6646400	6647200	Who's there?
6647200	6647680	Dwayne.
6648320	6649200	Dwayne who?
6649200	6650560	Dwayne the tub.
6650560	6651280	I'm drowning.
6653520	6654240	There's a name.
6654880	6656960	There's a famous name, Dwayne.
6656960	6659680	That sounds more like the word drain than Twain.
6659680	6660480	Doesn't matter.
6660480	6666320	Look, I saw a rogue family of coyotes in your yard.
6666320	6666720	Oh, shit.
6666720	6668080	Are you Christopher Walken?
6668080	6669600	Yes, I'm Christopher Walken.
6669600	6670160	Come in.
6670160	6671280	The famous actor.
6672320	6672800	Thank you.
6672800	6673520	Come in, come in.
6673520	6674000	Thank you.
6674000	6677520	I could have come in without you even opening the door.
6677520	6678240	Oh, my God.
6678240	6679760	Yeah, you got coyotes.
6683760	6686560	All right, yeah, I called the city,
6686560	6688480	but they said they couldn't send anyone,
6688480	6690640	but then you must then get called?
6690640	6695040	There's only one way to get rid of coyotes.
6695040	6696800	Did you bring me out to talk about coyotes?
6697920	6698480	It's complicated.
6698480	6699680	Who the fuck is this guy?
6699680	6701120	This is my assistant, Steve Levy.
6701120	6703520	I told him to call people about the coyotes.
6703520	6704560	This is Christopher Walken.
6704560	6705600	Steve, he's famous.
6705600	6706480	He's from Hollywood.
6706480	6707200	I'm an actor.
6708480	6712240	I hate coyotes as much as anyone does.
6712800	6715040	Do you want to come in back and look at the spot
6715040	6716240	where I think there's a nest?
6717680	6719120	Coyotes have a nest?
6719120	6720000	Yeah, they have nests.
6721280	6722240	What did you think they had?
6722240	6728240	Can I bring my friend and Jeff Goldblum?
6728960	6730400	Yeah, yeah, you can.
6732000	6733760	Hey, Jeff, come in.
6733760	6735520	Jeff Goldblum, I want you to come in here
6735520	6737200	and help me with this coyote nest.
6746240	6747280	That looks like a problem.
6750240	6753520	Hey, Jeff, I know you hate coyotes too.
6753520	6756640	Well, Chris, if I can correct you,
6756640	6760960	it's not that I hate a coyote.
6760960	6769600	It's just that they once ate my cat.
6770880	6772560	Chris, help Dan Harmon.
6772560	6773680	He created Rick and Morty.
6778640	6779600	It's funny you mentioned that.
6779600	6787680	I was binge-watching R&M, as I call it.
6788320	6792640	And I thought that the last season was very good.
6792640	6793440	Oh, thank you.
6794000	6794640	Oh, Dan Harmon.
6794640	6795920	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, Jeff.
6795920	6797120	Hi, hey, Dan.
6797120	6798480	I like you on criminal intent.
6798480	6799760	I mean, it's a...
6799760	6802160	That's very kind of you.
6802160	6804560	It's very, Dan, I got to tell you,
6804560	6808560	it's very kind of you to say that.
6809600	6811680	I don't think it was my best work.
6811680	6813360	I actually wish that Alicia Witt
6813360	6815280	would have kept working on the show.
6815280	6816400	I really liked her.
6816400	6817600	Well, you're very sweet, Dan.
6817600	6818160	You're very sweet.
6819040	6820480	Let's go kill some coyotes.
6826880	6828560	Okay, you go out back.
6829280	6833280	There's a coyote nest near the south wall of the property.
6833280	6834320	I cast...
6834320	6835040	I go...
6836080	6836320	Wait.
6837280	6838400	Do you guys hate me?
6838400	6839040	What is this?
6843360	6846800	No, but I understand you.
6846800	6847280	Do you?
6848320	6848800	I do.
6850160	6852160	Do you accept that I'm as confused as you are?
6853440	6854560	I did earlier.
6854560	6856000	And then at a point, I was like,
6856000	6857440	well, maybe he didn't.
6859520	6862240	I wanted to play D&D, and then it became Jeff Goldblum.
6862240	6864320	Did you really want to play D&D for 10 minutes?
6864320	6866080	Or did you feel like me,
6866080	6867040	like sometimes it's just like,
6867040	6868720	what are you trying to do with me?
6868720	6870320	Like, what about a pop in your ass?
6870320	6872000	Can we do a quick combat round
6872000	6874000	with coyotes in Dan's backyard
6874000	6877280	with Chris Walken and Steve Levy?
6877840	6879120	You were just doing that.
6879120	6882880	Yeah, but let's start the combat.
6882880	6883840	That's not like...
6883840	6884960	That's a breadcrumb.
6884960	6886160	I don't care about that.
6888560	6889440	Okay, all right.
6889440	6890560	Just do that then.
6890560	6891680	No, no, no, no.
6891680	6896080	Now, let's just lay the seeds of a D&D thing.
6896080	6896480	Right.
6896480	6897200	Because it's never gonna...
6897200	6899920	Well, now, finally, it's now the point
6899920	6901280	where it's not long enough.
6901280	6901440	Yeah.
6902320	6903680	That's what's weird about it.
6903680	6903920	All right.
6903920	6906960	So Spencer, lay down what's going on in Dan's backyard.
6907920	6908960	There's coyotes.
6908960	6909280	Come on.
6911920	6913680	I am livid.
6915280	6917920	No, in the D&D campaign, not the backyard.
6920240	6921120	There's no time.
6921920	6923200	We have three minutes.
6924960	6926240	That's not 10 minutes.
6930080	6930640	All right.
6930640	6932240	Three minutes of D&D.
6934400	6935600	No, Jesus.
6938160	6939680	Bro, just run it.
6942320	6943520	I can't...
6943520	6944400	I'm sorry, Spencer.
6944400	6948000	I don't normally cow to hecklers,
6948000	6950400	but if there's ever been a situation
6950400	6951920	where a bro needed to just run it...
6955680	6958560	I mean, talk about a voice of reason.
6962240	6962480	No.
6964080	6965920	But remember earlier when you're like,
6966080	6967040	we don't have any time?
6968080	6970320	That concern is now valid.
6972160	6973920	Back then, it was less valid.
6973920	6974960	It wasn't invalid.
6976320	6980080	What if you laid down the intro to where we were at?
6980080	6982400	You decided to become potato farmers.
6982400	6983600	That was already said.
6983600	6984080	Okay.
6984080	6984320	Okay.
6985040	6986080	That's the whole thing.
6987120	6988880	So tell us...
6990480	6993280	I mean, it's been a while that we're working
6993280	6994480	on the potato farm, right?
6994480	6995120	No.
6995120	6997680	You decided to become potato farmers.
6997680	6997840	Yeah.
6997840	6999760	So we don't control what happened.
6999760	7000640	Tell us what happened.
7001680	7002480	Just run it, bro.
7005120	7008320	They're willing to stay for another eight minutes.
7008320	7008820	Yeah.
7012720	7014320	I really...
7024480	7027760	Hey, Chad and...
7028800	7029520	You're Chad?
7029520	7030080	I'm Chad.
7031600	7032480	Carlos and...
7032480	7034080	I'm doing that with Goldblum, too.
7034080	7035280	Goldblum kept calling.
7037120	7037760	What's...
7037760	7039200	I forgot his name.
7039200	7039600	I don't...
7040720	7041920	Carlos.
7041920	7042800	No, you're Carlos.
7042800	7043040	You're...
7044800	7045440	Oh, yeah.
7045440	7046480	Diarrhea Jr.
7046480	7047200	Hey, Carlos.
7047200	7049760	DJ, got some bad news for you.
7051280	7053120	We got a low potato yield.
7054800	7056160	It looks like we're gonna have to go out
7056160	7058000	and kill some people to make some money
7058000	7059520	because the potatoes are not gonna bring in
7059520	7060560	what we thought we're gonna make.
7061120	7063040	Well, you say that every harvest.
7063040	7068000	Well, we're bad at potato harvesting.
7068000	7070560	Yeah, but we were worse at killing people
7070560	7071760	and it's a worse thing to do.
7071760	7072720	I think we are better.
7073440	7077760	I mean, look around and count your potatoes.
7078640	7080720	I like to think it's quality over quantity.
7081760	7083200	They're pretty damn good potatoes.
7083200	7084080	They're good potatoes.
7084080	7085200	You like the taste.
7085200	7085680	They were...
7085680	7086180	Yeah.
7086960	7088400	Look, I don't want this to...
7088400	7090000	Do you guys know how many potatoes
7090000	7091360	it takes to kill an Irishman?
7093840	7094320	Zero?
7095440	7096560	What's an Irishman?
7096560	7097040	Oh, yeah.
7100240	7103040	Do you know what kind of meat a priest
7103040	7104800	is allowed to eat on Fridays?
7106720	7107280	Fish?
7107280	7107600	None.
7109840	7110640	It's an old...
7110640	7111520	From the old...
7111520	7112960	You take that, Catholics!
7113840	7115360	Does Friday a thing with them?
7115360	7116160	I don't even know.
7118160	7120320	As much as I like the lifestyle
7120320	7121680	of being a gentleman farmer,
7122400	7124400	I kind of miss the days of traveling
7124400	7127360	and being on quests.
7127360	7129200	You never became farmers.
7132320	7134960	Well, it'd be nice to know that a while ago.
7134960	7137680	I said you decided to become farmers.
7137680	7139360	Yes, we fucking did.
7139360	7141760	No, that's not what deciding means.
7141760	7142160	Okay.
7142160	7143280	Okay, well...
7143280	7143920	Okay, you...
7143920	7145040	They brought it, bro.
7145040	7145840	Oh, Jesus Christ.
7147120	7148240	That makes a lot of sense.
7148240	7150000	The reason why we never grew any potatoes
7151360	7155360	is that we never seeded or harvested
7155360	7157360	any actual potatoes.
7157360	7158160	Come on, you can't...
7160400	7161920	You're not like our monkey.
7161920	7162720	I get that.
7163520	7165520	But if you don't want to do it,
7165520	7168800	then do you want to tell us what happened
7168800	7170320	instead of us becoming farmers?
7170800	7171280	That...
7172080	7174000	You decided to become farmers.
7174000	7174720	Right, we decided.
7174720	7175840	And then we ended.
7175840	7177040	And then that was it.
7177040	7177520	Okay.
7177520	7178000	So like...
7178000	7179920	Oh, you're saying you're not allowed
7179920	7182800	to advance time and assume that you...
7182800	7184320	You need to roll for several seasons
7184320	7185360	of potato farming or...
7186000	7186560	Okay, all right.
7186560	7189120	We could talk all about all of that.
7189120	7191120	He's like, we're not going to let time
7191120	7192640	have passed between seasons.
7192640	7194240	We're starting where we left off.
7194240	7195680	I feel like we've left it.
7195680	7197520	I thought you wanted to become potato.
7197520	7199360	I thought that's what you wanted to be doing.
7200000	7202160	I didn't know that's what you're not doing.
7202160	7205920	I say to DJ and to Carlos,
7205920	7207360	I don't want to be a potato farmer.
7207360	7208480	I want to...
7208480	7210560	But you've been one for three years now.
7210560	7211200	Yes.
7211200	7212000	No, no.
7212000	7212640	I mean, I don't...
7216560	7218400	I want to go work for the Church
7218400	7220080	of the Silver Flame.
7223440	7224640	You haven't had enough of that?
7225520	7226560	We didn't get it right.
7226960	7230400	Let's, for the first time in our lives,
7230400	7231840	go do something that matters.
7233600	7234080	Why?
7234080	7235440	I prayed...
7235440	7237920	Spencer, what's the God of the Silver Flame?
7237920	7238320	Is there a name?
7238320	7239200	The Silver Flame.
7242400	7244800	I get on one knee,
7244800	7245600	because they don't like it
7245600	7246960	when you're on both knees,
7246960	7248240	I say Silver Flame.
7249600	7250080	Guide us.
7251280	7252640	Let us redeem ourselves.
7253440	7254800	Send us a mission.
7254800	7255840	Send us a cause.
7257520	7259920	To go defend you for.
7261280	7262160	All right.
7262160	7263840	A potato falls in your lap.
7274160	7275840	You have a lap when you kneel?
7276880	7279440	I mean, I was on one knee,
7279440	7280560	so there's a half lap.
7280560	7281840	Yeah, there's still a lap.
7281840	7282320	Fucked up.
7282320	7283360	You're just weird.
7285040	7286400	I found a magic potato.
7286400	7287680	I open up the magic potato
7287680	7288640	to see if there's anything
7288640	7289840	inside the magic potato.
7289840	7291280	No, it's just broken in half now.
7292880	7293920	Damn, dude, you're good
7293920	7296000	at opening those potatoes.
7296000	7297360	I get down on my other knee,
7297360	7300960	I say Silver Flame.
7302160	7303360	If that truly was you,
7303360	7304640	send me another message.
7304640	7305200	What in the...
7309520	7310640	I just say that.
7310640	7312480	Well, I don't need another sign.
7312480	7313600	That's fucking...
7313600	7314400	That's more than you
7314400	7315920	should be able to ask for.
7315920	7317040	I was right.
7317040	7318800	I think, well, I guess nothing happened.
7318800	7320320	So I guess that word
7320320	7321840	just potato farmers now.
7321840	7323360	Well, we decided we were gonna be.
7325200	7326400	I wouldn't say we were.
7326400	7327120	Can I invite my...
7328480	7330640	Can I invite my friend,
7332560	7333520	Jeff Goldblum over?
7334960	7335600	No, I'm kidding.
7335600	7336160	I'm kidding.
7336160	7337520	I didn't mean to make that sound.
7337520	7338960	That implied that the answer is no,
7338960	7341280	but I'm gonna...
7342640	7343440	Look, the truth is,
7343440	7345120	you guys don't have to come with me.
7346080	7346800	It's not like...
7347280	7348640	We're not potato farmers.
7348640	7349760	We're warriors.
7349760	7351360	We're spiritual warriors.
7351360	7353280	We've done nothing but fail.
7353280	7354480	We never remember what we're doing.
7354480	7355920	Why do you wake up at 8 a.m.
7355920	7358960	every morning and lift and pump iron
7358960	7359360	if you're not...
7360000	7362000	That's not potato prepping, you know?
7363200	7364560	You're getting ready for something.
7365360	7366960	You're not a potato prepper.
7366960	7369840	That's me trying to live past 47.
7371120	7372480	Because I like milkshakes
7372480	7373840	and Philly cheesesteaks.
7373840	7375040	And my fiancé,
7375840	7377040	who's 12 years younger than me
7377040	7377600	and a woman,
7377600	7379440	which means she has 24 more years
7379440	7380560	on average to live than me.
7381280	7383280	I don't want to, like, die going like,
7383280	7383920	oh, man...
7390320	7391440	Don't break the fourth wall.
7391440	7392800	Hey, uh...
7392800	7394320	This character doesn't work out.
7394320	7396960	Can I give you guys like an easy pitch?
7397520	7399760	Let's stop potato farming.
7399760	7400880	It's not what we're meant to do.
7400880	7401200	It's...
7401200	7402080	You're at your pit.
7403120	7403520	What?
7403760	7406000	You're acting like you're subversive now.
7406000	7407600	We haven't even started potato farming
7407600	7408560	and you're like, what if we...
7409840	7410960	So one thing we haven't tried.
7410960	7411440	Look, I...
7412080	7412880	What were you gonna say?
7414640	7416400	You guys pick a direction
7416400	7418080	and then I'm like, okay, great.
7418080	7419680	And then the next episode happens
7419680	7421440	and you go the opposite direction.
7421440	7422880	So, like, the last time you're like,
7422880	7424240	what if we were potato farmers?
7424240	7425440	And I was like, okay.
7425440	7426480	And now you're like,
7426480	7427680	all you're doing is like,
7427680	7429360	we can't be potato farmers.
7429360	7430080	Not me.
7430080	7430720	I'm not doing that.
7430720	7431280	No, I know.
7431280	7432160	But it's just like...
7433520	7435280	But it's like the only...
7435280	7436880	If the only thing you want to know
7436880	7439360	is that you don't want to do the thing there is.
7439360	7441200	That's not the only thing that I know though.
7441200	7443040	I'm stopping you there, but...
7443040	7444320	This is the royal you.
7444960	7445440	All right.
7445440	7445680	Right.
7445680	7447520	If the only thing one does is nothing,
7447520	7448640	then nothing gets done.
7448640	7449680	Yeah, I get that.
7449680	7451680	Which is why I wanted to become a potato farmer
7451680	7452080	because I was like,
7452080	7453040	that's a thing I can remember
7453040	7454800	through a blackout drunk to the next episode.
7456080	7457280	Because I felt like we're...
7457280	7461120	You perceive me or us or the royal we
7461760	7464160	as disrespecting the game.
7465280	7465920	I'm always like...
7465920	7468080	The impetus behind me,
7469120	7470640	the potato farming thing was honestly,
7470640	7471680	like as usual,
7471680	7472800	which I've done it before,
7472800	7473520	where I'm just kind of like,
7475280	7477360	we're shitting all over this thing
7477360	7478560	that Spencer preps for.
7478560	7479760	We never know what we're doing.
7479760	7482000	And we always end up burning people's houses down.
7482000	7482800	And it's not...
7483760	7484880	We don't know what we're doing.
7484880	7485520	We're always like,
7485520	7486720	oh, what's your name?
7486720	7487680	And the person's like,
7487680	7488400	my name's Todd.
7488400	7489360	You've known me for 11 years.
7489360	7489680	And we're like,
7489680	7490880	yeah, but I thought you were Todd.
7490880	7491120	And we're like,
7491120	7492080	no, the elephant's Todd.
7492080	7493920	And then he's like excited about horses.
7493920	7495040	And then we're just like,
7495040	7496320	like we just kill people.
7496320	7497440	And then we don't know.
7497440	7498320	And I just think like,
7499360	7500640	I dream of like,
7500640	7501120	I'm like,
7501120	7503200	oh, well, maybe if we reset
7503200	7504000	and we're just like,
7504800	7506640	like we make it simple like Willow
7506640	7508480	and we just go plow a field
7508480	7510400	and then we can just fucking really carefully.
7510400	7512160	Like if an adventure comes along,
7512160	7513040	we can like be like,
7513040	7516080	okay, like we can't fuck this up.
7516080	7516960	And we'll just be like,
7516960	7518320	let's baby step this
7518320	7519360	and like,
7519360	7520640	let's take it seriously.
7520880	7521760	And not fuck it up.
7522400	7525360	It's just my desire to do well.
7525360	7526240	No, I get all that.
7526240	7526960	I get all that.
7527600	7529120	It's just again,
7529120	7531200	it's that now you're not doing that.
7531200	7533120	And that's all you're spending time doing.
7533120	7535280	I thought I was trying to get us
7535280	7536240	out of potato farming
7536240	7538080	and just try to like trigger
7538080	7539680	like that we were going to go
7539680	7541040	on a new quest.
7541040	7544560	I think you should let me potato farm
7545360	7547520	because it seems like a thing
7547520	7549440	that needs to happen to you
7549440	7551520	because you don't want it to happen.
7551520	7555360	Okay, I use my skill of wild empathy.
7560720	7562240	That makes me befriend animals.
7562240	7563360	I befriend animals.
7566160	7568720	And can I conjure an animal
7568720	7570560	or is that animal already have to be there?
7570560	7572320	Well, that would be like a separate spell.
7574240	7577760	It's been good adventuring with you boys.
7578400	7579040	All right.
7579680	7580560	Look, I'm bored.
7580560	7581760	I don't want to be a potato farmer.
7581760	7582800	I know.
7582800	7583680	If that's your game,
7584640	7585440	I can dig it.
7585440	7587600	I didn't mean to pitch it like it's
7587600	7588560	I think we should all do.
7590800	7592320	I feel bad.
7592880	7594000	I feel like a bad person.
7594880	7596640	I feel bad at what I do.
7596640	7598560	I feel like I don't know how to do it right.
7598560	7599840	And I want to experience the thing
7599840	7601200	that normal people experience,
7601920	7602800	which is like,
7602800	7604080	oh shit, I'm mad about this.
7604080	7604880	So I want to do it.
7604880	7606080	I know exactly what I want to do.
7606080	7606880	And it's like,
7606880	7608240	I get orders from the church
7608320	7609840	and then I'm like reacting to a backstory.
7609840	7610960	And I forget these details.
7610960	7612000	And it's just a tangled mess.
7612000	7614640	I just always feel like I'm a fucking guest
7615200	7617280	at some party thrown by a stranger.
7617280	7618240	The stranger is me.
7619520	7620720	We worship a flame.
7622480	7624480	And it's not even the color of regular flame.
7628160	7631920	I haven't lost my faith in our God.
7635360	7636960	Just lost my faith in myself.
7636960	7639120	Why don't you talk it out?
7639120	7641520	Like maybe like in a rhythmic way.
7643520	7644080	Thank you.
7644080	7645760	Suggesting that I invent singing.
7648080	7648640	And I'm right.
7649520	7651680	So you can invent rapping.
7653040	7653760	You can sing it.
7656080	7657120	Do a Stevie Nicks style
7657120	7658240	because she just got inducted
7658240	7660640	to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
7660640	7663120	Or you can toast it like a ranking rock.
7663120	7664320	I don't want to know.
7667440	7669680	What a waterfall does.
7672400	7674400	Waterfalls do fine.
7679040	7680320	I don't need to know.
7682400	7684320	Why the leaves go down.
7687440	7690080	Just something that leaves the side.
7690080	7697520	Because when the planet goes round and round.
7697520	7701440	The people feel safe and sound.
7701440	7705440	But the devils in the hollow earth
7705440	7708400	help the Jews plan 9-11.
7711440	7714560	They were warned out of the buildings.
7720480	7721760	You can Google it.
7723280	7724400	Cliff Hanger.
7724400	7726560	Thank you for coming to Harmon Sound everybody.
7726560	7727440	Steve Levy.
7727440	7728400	There's more to that song
7728400	7729440	than it actually turns out.
7732240	7734000	I'm your Comptroller Jeff Davis.
7734000	7735280	Thank you all for coming.
7735280	7738080	Thank you for Zach up there laying down the jam.
7740080	7743200	Your game master who didn't get to game master anything
7743200	7744480	is Spencer Crittenden.
7745440	7746320	How about your mayor?
7747120	7748160	Jan Harmon everybody.
7748160	7749280	Thank you so much for coming.
7749280	7749840	We love you.
7751680	7753840	We duly appreciate you coming down.
7753840	7755600	We'll drive fast and take chances.
7773600	7774480	Did you get any of that?
7776160	7777440	It's a good show.
