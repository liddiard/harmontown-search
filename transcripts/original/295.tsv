0	7960	Ladies and gentlemen, Harmentown is now in session.
7960	8960	How do you feel?
8960	13600	If you're at home right now, pull your pants down.
13600	20680	Please welcome to the stage, Dungeon Master, Game Master extraordinaire, Spencer Crittenden.
20680	21680	Yes!
22320	23320	Yes!
29720	35720	Here we are together, just us, and it wouldn't be just us unless we welcomed out the mayor
35720	39120	of Harmentown, Dan Harmon!
39120	40120	Yes!
44120	46800	I am Brandon Johnson, I'll be sitting in for Jeff Davis.
46800	49640	We love you, Jeff Davis.
49640	50640	Thank you.
50640	53080	I'm guest comptroller Brandon Johnson, thank you.
53080	60080	He just said it, he said it.
60080	61920	I think I'm just going to get right into it.
61920	67200	I don't really have a, I don't think I have, I've been purposely avoiding current events.
67200	73040	I don't think that's why anyone listens to this show.
73040	77640	You tune in to hear about me.
78640	85840	I forget about this Russia investigation, how is Dan taking it?
85840	91880	And so it's like the only news on that front is Dan is trying to, Dan is experimenting
91880	95560	with ignoring it.
95560	101640	And Dan understands that that is a full on coward move.
101640	107280	There's nothing that you can say to me, I don't think, that would like make me go,
107280	112000	now wait a minute, about what I am right now.
112000	119560	I am a fragile, white, closet libertarian, I think?
119560	128960	I don't know whatever I was, but I'm a coastal elite that just wants his Obama back.
128960	136560	Or any mannequin dressed like Obama that wants to just carry on the fucking status quo.
136560	142560	Bone strikes on Benghazi, whatever the fuck was the problem before, I don't care, just
142560	146280	get it back up and running.
146280	149160	I do not want Nazis in Atwater.
149160	155520	I don't want one of the five places that I used to go drink when the other four places
155520	158440	were shitty.
158440	161440	I always had a weird vibe about that place.
162440	166880	I always thought I could smell a little Nazi on that place.
166880	170680	Did you see the LA people talking about a local bar?
170680	172680	Did you know what I'm talking about?
172680	173680	Fuck you!
173680	174680	Okay, okay.
174680	175680	Did you happen?
175680	176680	I just care.
176680	177680	This is not politics.
177680	183120	By the way, none of this is fucking politics, it's a fascist coup, whatever, but an asteroid
183120	188800	coming at the earth isn't politics just because Republicans want to say it's not coming at
188800	189800	the earth.
189800	190800	That doesn't make it politics.
191160	194280	I don't give a fuck about Republicans and Democrats.
194280	197440	I'm scared of asteroids.
197440	199200	There's an asteroid called fascism.
199200	203680	A lot of my friends that I talk to, they go like, you know, I think it'll swing and it
203680	204680	always swings.
204680	205880	I know it always swings.
205880	207920	We're always addicted to the swing.
207920	208920	We love the swing.
208920	213880	We love the four years of this and the eight years and the four years and the eight years.
213880	217360	The swing that we're on right now is a 30-year swing.
217440	224600	It's a big old swing and the front porch is called the end of a country.
224600	230840	It takes 30 years to swing back and it's going to swing back to some horrible form of probably
230840	233480	militant socialism when it does swing back.
233480	234480	We're fucked no matter what.
234480	243360	Okay, so that's the end of my politics corner and what the fuck was that?
243360	244680	Oh, just in the...
244680	248280	So in the culture realm, I just found it interesting.
248280	250400	Did you see the apology for the...
250400	251400	I did.
251400	254400	This is not politics.
254400	260240	This is just, you know, as you guys know, I teach a masterclass in apologies.
260240	261880	Like apologies are...
261880	262880	I missed it.
262880	263880	They're very telling.
263880	268480	The guy's apology was essentially, hey, I'm Jewish.
268480	271960	My bouncers are gay and black and they love these guys.
271960	276040	Man, I didn't know they were Nazis because I didn't see no uniforms.
276040	277040	Right.
277040	278440	It was more of a...
278440	279440	It was just sort of a...
279440	280760	It was really defensive.
280760	282840	I would summarize his apology as this.
282840	287120	He was saying, look, I'm a businessman.
287120	293720	I don't know for sure that I can close the financial gap between a fascist or welcome
293720	296360	here bar and a fascist-only bar.
296360	300040	I'm going to need a couple more months.
300040	305160	So please keep having your liberal rap parties here because I need until like, I think 2019.
305160	310280	I think by then, then I could just say fascist-only and then it'll be fine.
310280	313160	They did need a little convincing to start throwing those people out.
313160	314160	That is the truth.
314160	319680	They said that the only color we see is green, which is my favorite answer to any sort of
319680	320680	racist question.
320680	326040	Like, oh, they're beating black people in the streets, hey, man, Kermit the Frog, motherfucker,
326040	328200	Kermit the Frog.
328200	329440	Plant life, bro.
329440	332360	Plant life green, that's all we see.
332360	337360	So it's crazy that it's like literally now right behind your house.
337360	338360	Right.
338360	342000	Well, you made fun of me two years ago when Kumail had his story that happened in Silverlake
342000	346240	and I was like, this happened in Silverlake and you're like, Silverlake?
346240	347240	Wow.
347240	350360	Way to rub my oppression in my face, Dan.
350360	354280	It won't be happening in our basements.
354280	356760	It's not even like, oh shit, it's at water.
356800	361000	But it does sort of signify a little bit of a shift that it's now in places where you
361000	363640	thought they were going to be hip white people sort of helping you out.
363640	364640	Yeah.
366640	369720	Or gay black bouncers, be fair.
369720	372520	Well, you know, the bouncer is black and the other one is gay.
372520	376160	He merged the two to have a super bouncer.
376160	379680	So yeah, it does mean a little something when you hear it like, oh shit, it's going down
379680	382680	and like, Los Feliz.
383680	387480	Because you're getting chased out of little doms of shit is when it's going to get like
387480	388480	pretty critical.
390520	395560	I got to say, I do like the forced kind of survival behavior of some of these groups
395560	400480	where these groups are almost in a mocking or like psyops way.
400480	405600	They're like, hey, look, we're if we were if we were racist, we wouldn't have this guy
405600	410560	or this guy because it actually does for I do think I see a million flaws in the mirror
410560	415400	when we were like, like hating some of these guys is making it hopefully the positive
415400	416400	side.
416400	419000	It's like, oh, what what do you hate and why?
419000	420000	And the answer is nationalism.
420000	422920	The answer is all these, you know, ideology.
422920	428280	Let's not be fooled by like, you know, let's not be too so fashionable that we're blinded
428280	429280	by this shit.
429280	431640	That's kind of that's what that's what trolling helps.
431640	436280	It's like this bleach you scatter across things and like kind of like it's corrosive, but
436280	439040	it kind of like also gets some shit off the counter.
439040	440040	You know, yeah.
440040	441480	Let's not talk about good versus bad.
441480	446560	Let's not talk about fucking like, yeah, like you can tell how liberal you are by how many
446560	450120	black people are in your club, but you can't edit.
450120	453440	You can know it is a good indicator.
453440	459160	And I'm doing pretty good as long as Jeff as long as Jeff keeps getting sick, man.
459160	462620	This is the most liberal podcast in town.
462620	465640	We want to invite you, but you ate too many lemon bars.
465640	470960	All right, so I have a special story.
470960	473800	That's enough of that.
473800	477440	I know 30% of my fans are Nazis, and that's why there's probably there's empty seats here
477440	478440	now.
478440	479440	The show is failing.
479440	480440	It's 30%.
480440	481800	No, 30% of the seats are empty.
481800	482800	Yes.
482800	485320	I mean, not 30, right, guys?
485320	486320	Jesus.
486320	488240	Well, you can't believe them.
488240	489240	Those are full seats.
489240	490240	They're biased.
490240	494200	They're like, hey, empty seats.
494200	495200	Are you not here?
495200	496200	What?
496200	497200	What?
497200	498200	You're weird.
498200	501200	Who are you, dad?
501200	506200	So here's a story I have to sit down for, because it's a...
506200	507200	Oh, shit.
507200	509200	A sit-down story, Dan?
509200	510200	Oh, shit.
510200	512200	And a hard sit-down.
512200	514200	Okay, get your mic.
514200	515200	Okay.
515200	516200	All right.
516200	517200	Get it to the mind.
517200	518200	All right.
518200	519200	Okay.
519200	520200	All right.
520200	524200	Papa Bear's going to tell you a story.
524200	525200	Okay.
525200	527200	Here we go.
527200	529200	Where is the...
529200	530200	Okay.
530200	540840	So the story starts on Thursday, when I get a text message from dad on my phone.
540840	546640	And it's very nice, Thursday, 12.28 p.m.
546640	554040	As your father, I wanted to text you to tell you how proud of you I am for your Emmy nomination
554040	566920	for that pickle show you worked so hard on.
566920	572040	And as a good son, six hours later, I text, dad, thanks.
572040	573840	But here's something of even higher value.
573840	575440	I got a Tesla.
575440	576440	Because my dad...
576440	578240	I'm like, I want to bond with my dad about...
578240	579240	He's a car guy.
579240	580240	Because stuff...
580240	581240	Oh, my God.
581240	582600	I'm bonding with my dad.
582600	585080	I'm texting you right now while it drives itself.
585080	586080	It was true.
586080	587640	Don't judge me.
587640	592040	Also, the last thing that we ever read.
592040	593040	And then...
593040	595400	So this is where my dad starts to really blow my mind.
595400	596400	Already...
596400	597400	That was nice.
597400	598400	Congratulations.
598400	599400	Yeah.
599400	600400	Yeah.
600400	604320	But then he says, but what about the smudges on the touch screen?
604320	605800	Couldn't you afford the Edison?
605800	611960	And I went, holy shit, my dad is making references to my television show, Great Minds with Dan
611960	614960	Harmon, which is a really deep cut.
614960	615960	Yeah.
615960	617960	Yeah.
617960	619960	On top of an Edison joke, which you never hear.
619960	623600	And then my dad goes, nothing like self-congratulatory callbacks.
623600	632160	I'm like, well, my dad is like so hip.
632160	633560	So at this point, it's important...
633560	639160	The story happens in layers, and it gets a little thick, and there's shit to unpack.
639160	643920	But the first thing I need to do now is bring up the director of Great Minds with Dan Harmon,
643920	654760	Heath Cullins.
654760	659880	So before we start to unpack this, Heath, I guess the first question is, do you remember
659880	665160	when and why I put your number in my phone as dad?
666160	668160	He asks everybody.
668160	670160	I forgot, for sure.
670160	671160	No, no, no.
671160	674160	Don't feel bad, because he asks everybody this question.
674160	676160	How many people...
676160	682160	I do, in fact, remember...
682160	685160	I wish it were more tawdry than it actually is.
685160	692160	So we, as Dan mentioned, worked on Great Minds together, and it was not the highest of budgeted
692160	697000	folks, so we didn't have VFX for things, necessarily, other than the really awesome
697000	700000	stuff in the lab that I'm sure you all saw.
700000	705760	But we couldn't burn in the image of dad calling on his cell phone, so we had to have...
705760	710600	To shoot it, we had to have an actual phone, probably not this one, because you have a
710600	712800	Tesla now, so you've got a newer phone probably as well.
712800	718960	The Ron Funches episode, he plays Idi Amin, and the way the resolution to the conflict
718960	724920	with Idi Amin, who turns into a hostage situation, but then my dad calls on the phone, and Idi
724920	731480	Amin enjoys talking to him about politics, and they calm each other down until Idi turns
731480	733600	into dust.
733600	741360	So we had to put your phone number in my phone as dad, so that when you called me, it would
741360	745480	say dad, and then I forgot.
745480	751800	But it's notable, the important thing about the story, the absolute tragedy of this story,
751800	759520	is that it's not just me thinking that I have a new, wonderful relationship with my dad,
759520	763320	and Heath is not trying to deceive me.
763320	770080	If you scroll back through this window, there are a half a dozen times over the years where
770160	771760	the following conversations happen.
771760	785000	It's like, it'll say like, let's see, let's see, Thursday, May 10th, 12.42 p.m., he texts,
785000	787920	congrats on that ginormous renewal.
787920	796920	As recently as the 70 episode thing, I remembered, and I say, thanks, dad.
796920	799180	You're still in my phone as dad.
799180	802260	So I remember and I know.
802260	806420	So he thinks I remember and I know.
806420	811140	So the really sad part of this, the whole thing that happens that starts on Thursday,
811140	817820	is that I'm thinking I have a new, like, late life friendship with my dad, and Heath thinks
817820	827260	that Dan Harmon's being really nice to him.
827260	833460	So now knowing that it's Heath, and that Heath doesn't know I don't know it's my dad,
833460	839100	and that I don't know it's not my dad, let's start just over again, and you can read your
839100	841180	part and I'll read my part.
841180	847220	And then it continues until last night, at which point I realized, when Cody, I think
847220	853020	Cody pointed out, no, you did, oh God, and then at a certain point I was like, you have
853020	856940	to come on the show, and we have to share this, this is the worst thing that's ever
856940	860940	happened to two people, like, okay.
860940	864780	So yeah, you want to just start with As Your Father.
864780	865780	As Your Father?
865780	866780	Yeah.
866780	867780	Yeah.
867780	869780	Thursday, 1228 p.m.
869780	874340	As Your Father, I wanted to text you to tell you how proud of you I am for your Emmy, spelled
874340	881460	E-M-M-I-E, because I thought that would be more dad-like, for your Emmy nomination,
881460	883860	for that pickle show you worked so hard on.
883860	885180	See, now I get it.
885180	889220	You're acting, you're talking like a dad, but you weren't trying to fool me.
889220	890220	No.
890220	892340	You were doing the same bit that we kept doing.
892340	893420	There's a millitude.
893420	894540	I just forgot.
894540	898340	I just drank that part of the Rolodex away.
898340	903340	And so I go, dad, thanks, but here's something of even higher value.
903340	904340	I got a Tesla.
904340	906340	I'm texting you right now while it drives itself.
906340	909580	But what about the smudges on the touch screen?
909580	911300	Couldn't you afford the Edison?
911300	914940	Nothing like self-congratulatory callbacks.
914940	920940	Self-congratulatory, because he knows that it's the director of the show that he's referencing,
920940	924980	so he's not trying to fool me.
924980	928340	But I'm like, oh my god, I'm texting Cody in the meantime.
928340	931100	I'm like, my dad, look at what they're sending her screen grabs.
931100	932100	I'm looking.
932100	934900	He's making great minds references.
934900	945180	Oh, this is on some make-a-wish shit.
945180	953580	So I sent a video of the inside of my Tesla as a video of just going from the dashboard
953580	956500	to the steering wheel, because I wanted to show that it was driving itself.
956500	959140	But it doesn't look like any.
959140	962460	It looks the same as a normal car, because you're just shooting from here.
962460	965420	I can't tell that it's driving itself.
965420	970420	And so I just sent an unremarkable video showing that, and I said, I always want to show people
970420	974100	a video of me not driving, but the LA cops are too aggressive about pulling over for
974100	975100	texting and driving.
975100	977580	They're not too aggressive.
977580	984700	I support the law about distracted driving.
984700	988460	I just meant they're too aggressive for me to get that video in full.
988460	994060	I'd have to do so much that I would be distracted driving.
994060	1004500	So then my dad says, I send a video of me fakely self-driving my Hyundai Elantra on
1004500	1006340	the highway, and it says NBD.
1006340	1011380	I'm like, oh my god, my dad says NBD.
1011380	1015060	My Hyundai can do that too with the video.
1015060	1023460	And then he shows a video, and it's like the Hyundai dashboard, but then a camera shake,
1023460	1029700	and the sound of what I thought was my dad doing a crazy character going, oh, god damn
1029700	1030700	it.
1030700	1036380	And he was affecting this fun voice and doing this comedy bit.
1036380	1042940	And Heath just pointed out backstage that had I watched the entire video, which I always
1042940	1048260	stopped, even though I kept showing it to Cody and going, my dad's doing bits.
1048260	1054900	It cuts to black because the phone falls down after six seconds of which Heath picks up
1054900	1061740	the phone, looks into the lens, and goes, whatever, does some self-effacing bit, which
1061740	1063500	I've never seen.
1063500	1071420	And so that, if only I had watched the video all the way, instead I just text absolutely
1071420	1076700	sincerely, ha ha.
1076700	1079220	So then days go by.
1079220	1082060	So I walk into little doms the other day.
1082060	1084500	Last night's, well, Saturday night.
1084500	1085500	No.
1085500	1086500	Saturday?
1086500	1087500	Yeah, it says Saturday.
1087500	1088500	OK, yes.
1088500	1089500	Saturday night.
1089500	1090500	Two days later.
1090500	1093500	I walk into little doms with Cody.
1093500	1095100	Jon Hamm is sitting there.
1095100	1097420	I'm just going to go ahead.
1097420	1098420	Who cares?
1098420	1099420	Whatever.
1099420	1102660	I'm sitting there with Edgar Wright and- Paint a picture.
1102660	1103660	All of them.
1103660	1109900	I'm not going to name everybody.
1109900	1114100	But like Joaquin Phoenix, and like Cicely Tyson.
1114100	1115380	It was a table of stars.
1115380	1116380	A Batman.
1116380	1121900	A table of stars.
1121900	1128860	Perched in the booth there, not the head, it was a little booth, and it's very clearly
1128860	1131300	Warren Beatty.
1131300	1135100	And it's like, ugh.
1135100	1141260	That's famous even for L.A., like crazy famous, like legendary icon.
1141260	1143180	You don't expect to see Warren.
1143180	1147940	You expect to see Quentin Tarantino in a drive-through or something, like the back of his head.
1147940	1148940	That's Quentin Tarantino.
1148940	1153340	Or maybe even Harrison Ford, like, oh, look, he's jogging.
1153340	1158100	You just never expect to see Warren Beatty.
1158100	1161660	And I saw him, but I did what you're supposed to do.
1161660	1167620	I ignored him and pretended that he was a ghost and talked to Jon Hamm about how's business.
1167620	1168620	Where do you live now?
1168620	1172020	Oh, that's a good neighborhood.
1172020	1177300	And then we go over to the booth and we're like, Cody and I are like, wow, that's pretty
1177300	1178300	neat.
1178300	1179300	That's the real deal.
1179300	1181060	That's a big deal, like seeing Warren Beatty.
1181060	1186880	Didn't really meet him as such, just was introduced to him, but this is Warren.
1186880	1190880	So I met Warren Beatty, technically.
1190880	1195600	And also, what more do you need from that exchange?
1195600	1199240	I met Warren Beatty, that's peak Warren Beatty relationship, right?
1199240	1200240	I met him.
1200240	1204880	I'm not saying there's not more fulfilling things in store for you if you are his neighbor.
1204880	1206240	I just mean, me?
1206240	1208040	What am I going to do with a Warren Beatty friendship?
1208040	1209360	I'm like, this is it.
1209360	1211760	I got to share it with somebody.
1211760	1214960	But who do you share it with?
1214960	1219480	I don't want to come off like a star fucker to my LA friends.
1219480	1224360	And the truth is, even Cody's a little young to understand what a big deal it is to see
1224360	1227240	Warren Beatty in person.
1227240	1230960	Do I have an older friend who's from out of town?
1230960	1231960	Nope.
1231960	1233960	Wait a minute.
1233960	1241800	I think I said it out loud and Cody was like, well, your dad's been pretty cool lately.
1241800	1246720	So now I text my dad, but it's not my dad.
1246720	1254400	I'm texting Heath Cullens, the director of Great Minds, who thinks he's my friend.
1254400	1261280	He has good reason to think that I would just text him the following.
1261280	1264560	I just met Warren Beatty at a restaurant.
1264560	1266600	Exclamation point.
1266600	1268120	What?
1268120	1269120	Who are you?
1269120	1274600	A 1930s Hollywood royalty?
1274600	1278520	If I wasn't playing a dad, I promise I would have come up with something better than that.
1278520	1281320	But I was trying to stay in the voice.
1281320	1285560	Parentheses, in my mind, he's 120 years old.
1285560	1287480	Then I said, was it a Chick-fil-A?
1287480	1291240	I heard he loves waffle fries.
1291240	1293320	And then meanwhile, I'm trying to take a picture.
1293320	1298400	I'm trying to do a selfie thing because he's in a booth behind us.
1298400	1301380	I just thought, you never know if the camera's on top.
1301380	1307880	Maybe if I do one of these, maybe you'll see the top of Warren Beatty's head over me and
1307880	1308880	Cody.
1308880	1311360	But it ends up just being a nice selfie of me and Cody.
1311360	1312360	And that's fine, too.
1312360	1318160	And I send it to my dad, and I say, this would have been my attempt at a periscope shot,
1318160	1319160	Adam.
1319160	1320160	But there's no way.
1320160	1322640	So it's just us having met Warren Beatty.
1322640	1324140	I'll tell you what, man.
1324140	1332180	He looks way older than you.
1332180	1335100	Because it's important to compliment your dad.
1335100	1336100	And this is right.
1336100	1337860	I feel bad, but I'm trying to flatter my dad.
1337860	1341860	I'm like, he looks like a mummy that went to a barber and said, make my hair look like
1341860	1347300	Warren Beatty.
1347300	1354660	Maybe that's why you don't get to meet people.
1354660	1360340	I'm really excited that Dan is texting me these on Saturday night, unsolicited, unannounced.
1360340	1361620	So I keep playing along.
1361620	1364340	So he looks better than I expected.
1364340	1366660	But you're not playing my dad at this point, right?
1366660	1368140	You're just being Heath.
1368140	1369140	You think I know you're Heath.
1369140	1370140	Yes.
1370140	1371140	Yeah, OK.
1371140	1372140	All right.
1372140	1376700	I didn't want to fuck up the bit, I thought, where you were still enjoying that.
1376700	1378140	Just that you knew it was me.
1378140	1379140	OK.
1379140	1380140	Yeah, OK.
1380140	1381140	I'm not going to not.
1381140	1382140	Yes, I do.
1382140	1383140	So you think I know that it's you.
1383140	1384140	Yes.
1384140	1386980	And you think that even though I know it's you, I'm like doing a bit, I'm still treating
1386980	1387980	you like my dad.
1387980	1388980	I thought you.
1388980	1389980	Yeah.
1389980	1390980	OK.
1390980	1391980	We're entertained by it.
1391980	1392980	And so you say.
1392980	1396140	And Cody being there also made me feel that way.
1396140	1398140	Right.
1398140	1401340	Please don't fight, guys.
1401340	1402340	So then you say.
1402340	1403340	No, it's your.
1403340	1405740	So I say, so he looks better than I expected, is what I ask.
1405740	1408380	And I say, here's the important takeaway.
1408380	1415940	You are like three times sexier than Warren Beatty.
1415940	1424900	This is how cool a son I would be, by the way, if you just if like, look how low my
1424900	1434140	bar is for a dad before I open the fucking floodgates and I'm like your pal, like I'm
1434140	1437300	giving you like inside Hollywood shit.
1437300	1439700	I'm calling you sexier than Warren Beatty.
1439700	1445700	Like all you got to do is like congratulate me on an Emmy nomination and I will be your
1445700	1453380	son every eight hours via text message.
1453380	1456580	And yeah, so that I say you're three types sexier than Warren Beatty.
1456580	1461500	I say, boy, you two look like you have that post Beatty glow, though.
1461500	1463100	Are you both pregnant now?
1463100	1466420	He's old, but virile.
1466420	1468140	This is where it gets really sad to me.
1468140	1474580	This is where it takes a turn because we're because Cody and I are talking the whole time.
1474580	1478020	And the conversation isn't about Warren Beatty.
1478020	1479620	It's about my dad.
1479620	1485820	I'm like, so then I text Cody says you and mom should come out to California and we could
1485820	1488620	go to Death Valley with Cody's dad.
1488620	1493100	You'd probably like it in the desert.
1493100	1496300	I want to let you all know that you are falling for the same shit.
1496300	1498860	What do you mean?
1498860	1500340	What are they falling for?
1500340	1502980	They're going like, oh, this is this person.
1502980	1511700	There was all like, oh, he, daddy, oh, we all got, we all got wrapped up in this shit.
1511700	1517380	It's beautiful, but it's sad, but it is beautiful.
1517380	1518380	It's sad.
1518380	1525660	I mean, the beauty, the only, the beauty is only just go in.
1525660	1527020	It's a sad balloon.
1527020	1532640	Maybe it's inflated by beauty like we blow it up with beauty, but it's a balloon made
1532640	1533640	of sadness.
1533640	1534640	Yeah.
1534640	1537140	We like to call it the old piss stained clown.
1537140	1538780	All right.
1538780	1546220	So I invite you and mom out to California and you say, I'm not sure we can handle the heat.
1546220	1549540	It is a dry heat though.
1549540	1553540	So now at this point, I'm thinking, am I correct in assuming that maybe you're starting to
1553540	1555260	go, oh shit.
1555260	1561300	Does he think I'm like, I want to put on it the dad faux dadness of it enough that you're
1561300	1562300	like, right?
1562300	1563300	Haha.
1563300	1564300	Fuck you.
1564300	1565300	Right.
1565300	1566300	Whatever.
1566300	1567300	Dry heat.
1567300	1568300	Oh, he's really going over the top with this dad character.
1568300	1571260	But also at this point and Emma, my wife can attest to this.
1571260	1573500	I'm like, oh, he's really like playing.
1573500	1576380	We're like riffing and I didn't want to ruin it.
1576380	1584140	But I was also just like, what do I say now?
1584140	1591700	But and here's the sad part from not this is much sadder, but the sad part from my side
1591700	1595500	is like, I don't want Dan to think now I'm not funny.
1595500	1598660	Like that I can't keep it going.
1598660	1599660	Like a dad would think.
1599660	1600660	Yeah.
1600660	1602100	You'd want to be cool to your kid.
1602100	1604860	You're also like a son would think to for his.
1604860	1605860	That's right.
1605860	1608140	This whole I'm telling you is dynamic.
1608140	1610980	It's a lot of emptiness here.
1610980	1612100	I'm just swooning.
1612100	1617060	I just I go, it's so dry.
1617060	1620160	I'm a bigger pussy about heat than you and I was fine.
1620160	1623380	It's incredibly quiet and free and you can do whatever you want.
1623380	1624380	Just a thought.
1624380	1628020	Cody's dad loves the desert and so Cody kind of grew up going out there with him.
1628020	1629500	It was like her Dells.
1629500	1640860	That's a reference to the Wisconsin Dells where my family would go when I was a kid.
1640860	1648300	Does the next bit require a little context with the brothel thing because it does because
1648300	1651740	like like Cody's dad.
1651740	1657300	So I know Cody, Cody, who you all I'm assuming know since you watch the show and know who
1657300	1658540	she is.
1658540	1661220	She's a great writer, wrote a show that I worked on as well.
1661220	1664140	That's how I met Dan through directing the show that she wrote.
1664140	1669740	One of the things she told me, her dad is very cool, artistic, and when she was a youth,
1669740	1671580	they would go to the desert.
1671580	1675740	You've heard about that so far, but there was a brothel that he went to with her and
1675740	1681460	he was like friends with some of, I don't know what happened there, but they were friends
1681460	1684620	and it seemed sweet and I was like, that's crazy, Cody, and then we would always joke
1684620	1689100	about it and then Cody and her father recently went on a trip out there and the brothel
1689100	1693260	has since closed and he like collected a sign from the exterior of it and it was like sweet
1693260	1696460	but funny and just a cool little side story.
1696460	1702820	So I text after he suggests we go out there.
1702820	1705940	It's tempting and you know how I feel about brothels.
1705940	1708180	Does Cody's dad still know a good spot?
1708180	1717740	I know his favorite spot is closed, but maybe you, he, and I could find a new one together.
1717740	1727900	So then I turn to Cody and go, did you tell my dad about the brothels?
1727900	1735580	And Cody goes, I don't know, I tell everybody.
1735580	1739460	So on we go.
1739460	1742580	So I go, I go, we could start one.
1742580	1744660	I'm going to pitch it to Warren.
1744660	1748460	Oh, I bet he has some great thoughts on that.
1748460	1753140	He'll class up the joint for sure.
1753140	1759180	And then, hey, Dan, I'm really enjoying our father's son, Rep. Arte, I just want to make
1759180	1772340	sure you remember this is actually he.
1772340	1777380	The time stamp on this was 1052 p.m. on Saturday night.
1777380	1781660	This started at like 830 p.m. that night.
1781660	1788820	And so in my next text I said 1110, so that's 18 minutes later and I didn't get anything
1788820	1789820	else done.
1789820	1793780	Like, I just read that and took 18 minutes to respond.
1793780	1808340	Oh, my God, somebody just got dadfished.
1808340	1818340	I wish there was a way to cheer with a rotten tomato.
1818340	1822140	You don't like my Steve Harvey line of jokes?
1822140	1825980	They come with a briefcase and a peacock.
1825980	1829540	You deserve cheer booze for that.
1829540	1838060	Anyways, oh, my God, and then, oh, my God.
1838060	1842500	And then I just finished explaining this to Cody.
1842500	1844580	So that's what the 18 minutes is.
1844580	1848580	This is wow.
1848580	1853260	This is really so sad.
1853260	1857340	I kept showing messages to Cody and being like, this is so cool, I don't know when my
1857340	1860820	dad got so cool.
1860820	1865620	And Cody was like, I love your dad, I told you he was cool.
1865620	1869580	And I was like, yeah, but he just seems different, like he's funnier now.
1869580	1872820	Oh, my God.
1872820	1880820	The darkness of this makes it worth it.
1880820	1888900	I had 12 hours of the nicest, closest, most human relationship I've ever had with my dad.
1888900	1892460	So Cody says you have to come on harm in town so we can explain this whole story and read
1892460	1894660	these texts and walk through it.
1894660	1898500	You do understand that I really thought you were my dad the entire time from all the way
1898500	1901140	back to you congratulating me on the Emmy nom.
1901140	1907980	I thought my dad was revealing he watched Great Minds.
1907980	1920900	That's about it.
1920900	1924820	So many people in the back crying right now, it's okay, it's okay.
1924820	1932020	What did you learn about this moment of love?
1932020	1936060	That it was fake?
1936060	1937540	Is there a takeaway from that?
1937540	1938540	There is.
1938540	1939540	There is.
1939540	1940540	Okay.
1940540	1947660	There is because it's like, oh, my God, are we all, well, forget we, I use my I statements.
1947660	1962940	I am literally one sentence texted away from reaching out emotionally to my loved ones.
1962940	1973300	Like lowering my guard of being, you know, it makes you wonder how many sentences are
1973300	1979980	we away from just like the floodgates opening with people that don't have, we don't necessarily
1979980	1987860	have a 45-year back story with, but maybe the, you know, what if the postman said I'm
1987860	1992300	a post lady?
1992300	2001140	What if your mail person, you know, what sentence lies between you and a friendship with your
2001140	2008860	post deliverer, your aunts, your uncles, your neighbors, your intimate others, like how
2008860	2014020	many of us are in relationships where maybe you're in a funk for six months and like what
2014020	2017380	could one of you say that would like break the spell?
2017380	2021580	It's like, and it doesn't even have to be, it's a text.
2021580	2022580	Yeah.
2022580	2027340	What's great is there were, excuse me for this, but you were super brave.
2027340	2032380	Once somebody leaned out to you, reached out to you, you became a whole different motherfucker.
2032380	2033580	You got super brave.
2033580	2034580	You started sharing.
2034580	2035580	You did all these things.
2035580	2036580	Brave?
2036580	2041540	Is it, is it, is it brave to fawn and be like, yeah, it's brave to reach out to somebody
2041540	2045620	who might smack your hands and remind you of why you don't, I don't think my dad, to
2045620	2052820	be clear, I don't think my dad would, uh, in case this, you don't take this bravery.
2052820	2057260	But I don't think, I mean, I think people just why you don't meet nobody with my family
2057260	2058260	to be clear.
2058260	2066540	And I think this is a more, this is an important point to make, like the, you know, the, do
2066540	2067540	you need a glass?
2067540	2071340	Do you want to get, gets, can somebody get a Heath a glass?
2071340	2072980	Steve will probably get a cup.
2072980	2080740	There's a, there's a coffee mug that says world's greatest director.
2080740	2084740	You were saying to be clear with your family, there is, there's not, it's, it's, it's, it's
2085740	2094580	and I think I don't think there's a lot of like harm that could come of a tentacle reaching
2094580	2103140	out, you know, like, like it's, it's not like it, it, it, it, it, like there's a, there's
2103140	2109500	a wall between that exists between that happening in real life between me and my dad.
2109500	2112100	That's like, doesn't make really any sense.
2112100	2117260	That's why, as you can see, as soon as it was perforated, I never, and in spite of all
2117260	2121740	of the signs that should have, if I, if I thought I was like such an expert on why I
2121740	2125540	don't like regularly text my dad, I love you or something like that.
2125540	2132140	Like if like, why don't I recognize why can't I tell him from a friend?
2132140	2136100	The answer is because, because I, because I like them, love them, whatever you call
2136100	2142060	it, but, but, but like my family doesn't, you know, it's like, there's, there's a lot
2142100	2146900	of like, it's just, it's just, you know, like a lot of people can relate to this is like,
2146900	2152460	there's families that are like, they're like, they, they're proactive about like, you know,
2152460	2155500	this is how I feel about you and I love you and I'm proud of you or whatever.
2155500	2159420	And then there's families that are like, you know, they throw shoes at each other and all
2159420	2160420	this stuff.
2160420	2165220	And like, and then there's, you know, and there's a probably a good 70% of us like somewhere
2165220	2172140	in the middle where we're kind of like strained and like, you don't, I don't know.
2172140	2173140	Yeah.
2173140	2178340	But in this situation, when it was presented to you, you made the choice to be fucking
2178340	2181460	a bigger, better person than you might normally walk around as.
2181460	2184620	That's the only thing that I want to, I get, I get in this argument with my therapist all
2184620	2185620	the time.
2185620	2188740	So maybe I'm doing this thing that she yells at me about, which is like, but I don't really
2188740	2193980	think I deserve any accolades for my behavior because I wasn't really risking anything.
2193980	2196920	In my opinion, maybe you're seeing that differently.
2196920	2197920	That's interesting.
2197920	2198920	I didn't think about it that way.
2198920	2201820	I was just, I, I think of myself as being the selfish one too.
2201820	2205940	Like it's a two way street might not, you know, I don't like, I could text my dad anytime
2205940	2206940	I wanted to go.
2206940	2211760	I do it once a year, maybe like father's day, you know, give you the old challenge to say
2211760	2215580	that you should text your dad about the Emmy just to see what this conversation would really
2215580	2216580	look like.
2216580	2224740	I text, text, text my dad that I got.
2224740	2230140	I think he'd be more impressed with the Tesla, you know, either one, either one.
2230140	2234300	And we also witnessed somebody fucking being super, you want me to do it now as you do
2234300	2242300	that right now.
2242300	2245300	Everybody get out your phones and call someone you love right now.
2245300	2250020	I'm also going to need a dollar on each one of those phone calls.
2250020	2254740	My neighborhood's overrun by racism, I just, I also want to say that we got to see somebody
2254740	2262580	be so generous and just keep up a super loving act, which is like, I don't know why this
2262580	2266940	dude asked me to rub his back, but I'll rub his back.
2266940	2269100	It's kind of the coolest fucking thing in the world.
2269100	2273980	Well, I didn't, I didn't hear, I was waiting for Heath to look at his phone and notice
2273980	2279140	that I was, I wanted to, I wanted to do the bit that he was like, no, you just did it
2279140	2280140	again.
2280140	2281140	All right.
2281140	2282140	All right.
2282140	2283140	Oh, it didn't go.
2283140	2284140	It didn't go through.
2284140	2285140	Okay.
2285140	2286140	Yeah.
2286140	2287140	Yeah.
2287140	2288140	Yeah.
2288140	2289140	Yeah.
2289140	2290140	Yeah.
2290140	2291140	Yeah.
2291140	2292140	Yeah.
2292140	2293140	Yeah.
2293140	2294140	Yeah.
2294140	2295140	Yeah.
2295140	2296140	Yeah.
2296140	2297140	She's funnier than I am.
2297140	2301420	So she, I run them by, I run a lot of them by, um, no, she was, she was the one that finally
2301420	2310420	was like, are you sure that he doesn't think that you're his dad right now?
2310420	2313460	And I really didn't want to believe that was true.
2313460	2316860	But then I just wanted to think that him, that he and Cody were shooting the shit and
2316860	2317860	getting drunk.
2317860	2318860	And we're like, we should text.
2318860	2319860	He's a joke.
2319860	2320860	That'd be fun.
2320860	2322580	It's like, I'm only, I'm only doing this to you.
2322580	2323580	Yes.
2323580	2326340	And the suggestion, I think it's kind of a douchey thing to text your dad that you got
2326340	2327540	nominated for an Emmy.
2327540	2331260	I find that to be not like, here's the thing.
2331260	2332940	Last week you said, I'm happy.
2332940	2333940	Right.
2333940	2334940	Right.
2334940	2335940	So like there's steps to being happy.
2335940	2336940	Right.
2336940	2342340	And one of the fucking steps is to celebrate the good shit by bragging to your dad.
2342340	2343340	It's not bragging.
2343340	2344340	What is to your parents?
2344340	2346100	They're proud of you for fucking wiping your own ass one day.
2346100	2347740	They're like, I did that.
2347740	2353300	I won that Emmy.
2353300	2354300	Like I made that.
2354300	2360500	I mean, I want to say that it's not, that's not how my family works, but I believe it.
2360500	2364280	But then you'd say, well, this is the problem is you thinking that I'm not going to judge
2364280	2365280	you.
2365280	2366280	You can do whatever you want to do.
2366280	2367280	Really.
2367280	2369300	I mean, don't you think, don't you think it would be better to say like, how's your
2369300	2370300	boat?
2370300	2371300	Go get that shit.
2371300	2373620	Like to ask him something like, go get that thing you wanted.
2373620	2375180	I don't want, I don't want nothing.
2375180	2377180	I don't want nothing.
2377180	2378180	Go get that thing you wanted.
2378180	2379180	Okay.
2379180	2382940	I got busted kind of wanting something during this story, didn't I?
2382940	2384240	So that's the key.
2384240	2389980	If you're 45 years old and your weekend can be eclipsed and derailed by an accidental
2389980	2396460	radar ping that makes you think your dad loves you for a second, then, then you don't
2396460	2401020	have a right to be like, I don't need nothing from nobody.
2401020	2405340	You should, you should, you should, you should reach out to your dad and, and, and, and since
2405340	2410700	you're clearly still in childhood with that relationship, you may as well say, I made
2410700	2412300	a poo poo in the Emmy potty.
2412300	2413300	Okay.
2413300	2414300	All right.
2414300	2417260	Now I see the logic of it.
2417260	2418260	Okay.
2418620	2419940	Okay.
2419940	2423140	My show got nominated for an Emmy exclamation point.
2423140	2430700	I mean, it's by the way, it's, uh, it's midnight in Florida.
2430700	2435100	So he'll, he'll love that because he's been asleep for six hours.
2435100	2440820	So he's probably getting to about ready to get up, leave a voicemail, but it's also voicemail.
2440820	2443140	It's also not going to, what's that leave a voicemail.
2443140	2444140	Come on.
2444140	2445140	Stop it.
2445140	2446140	No.
2446140	2447140	No, no, no.
2447140	2448140	Deal breaker.
2448140	2454020	No, I, I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure 40% of my divorce with McGathey was like my inability
2454020	2455020	to FaceTime.
2455020	2462540	Like, I, I, I, I, I, come on, like I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm allowed to be part of society
2462540	2464300	because of the invention of text messaging.
2464300	2466980	Like I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't do the phone.
2466980	2467980	Uh, okay.
2467980	2472380	Uh, so, uh, yeah, I sent it and, uh, there you go.
2472380	2481300	It went through, but I'm telling you, I'm telling you, like, it's a, come on, it's,
2481300	2484940	it's a, I'm already the obnoxious, uh, Hollywood son.
2484940	2487700	Like I don't think, I really don't think, I think it's going to, I think he's going
2487700	2491660	to be like, he'll make a joke, he'll say, he'll say like, ah, don't get AIDS from it
2491660	2492660	or something.
2492660	2493660	I don't know.
2493660	2496940	Now I can capture his voice.
2496940	2498940	Now I'm ready.
2498940	2504060	Next round when you forget again, really got his voice now.
2504060	2505060	AIDS jokes.
2505060	2510740	That's the rock I needed to overturn.
2510740	2514220	When you make jokes around your family, do they still laugh or do they roll their eyes
2514220	2515220	and laugh?
2515220	2522860	I don't think, I don't know if I get, my family, my, my, my family, my mom and dad, like if
2522860	2527740	they're laughing, like we're usually, we'll laugh together at something.
2527740	2532180	Like if, you know, something funny happens, like I'm not like making anybody laugh.
2532180	2534640	Do you point it out though first, or is that in the Jeep?
2534640	2535640	Point out what?
2535640	2536640	Like whatever happened.
2536640	2539180	If somebody fell in front of you guys, who's going to fire first?
2539180	2543940	It's kind of like my dad, I think my dad's kind of in charge of when everyone starts
2543940	2544940	laughing.
2544940	2548980	Cause like he's not, if you know, if like he's not on board, everything's going to just
2548980	2552840	like sink anyway, you know, like, like, like, like you could do all the jokes you wanted
2552840	2560040	but and then, you know, like it's funny, it's more fun if my dad's like, yeah, yeah.
2560040	2564920	So I feel like that dude sort of has to bring you on stage a little bit cause it's his house.
2564920	2565920	My dad was super funny too.
2565920	2566920	That's why I asked.
2566920	2570760	I was like, you know, you have the first clown you see is your dad really.
2570760	2573720	He takes these big wrists in front of you and you're like, all right, let's see.
2573720	2574720	Yeah.
2574720	2575720	Yeah.
2575720	2578440	And there's this thing about puberty where you're like, I hope I'm as witty as that.
2578440	2579440	Yeah.
2579440	2580440	I want to smack him with my father.
2580440	2583320	It was fake cursing from Johnny dangerously.
2583320	2586320	So I'd be at the table and I'd be like, you farg an iceberg or I'd give him, I'd give
2586320	2595520	him this finger and he'd be like, okay, okay, Brandon, very funny.
2595520	2599440	I felt like when I hit puberty, like when you said those glands start overacting, like
2599440	2603560	yeah, I look back with kind of shame on that was a guy who was like bouncing off the walls
2603560	2605240	and like trying to be funny.
2605240	2608880	And I don't think, I don't think my dad was probably very incredibly entertained by it.
2608880	2613080	I think he was sort of confused, you know, he was, it was like, like bemused, like he'd
2613080	2615400	be like, what the, all right.
2615400	2619080	But then you killed him because we all know when you're, when you're a professional, there
2619080	2622200	is a moment where you've made your family laugh in a way that you didn't before.
2622200	2623200	You know what I mean?
2623200	2627120	Like you use all the shit you've learned sort of to come home and be like, this is fucking
2627120	2628120	funny.
2628120	2629160	You can't debate that.
2629160	2633320	So when you, do you remember the moment when you said something funny to your father and
2633320	2635640	you were like, I got you old motherfucker.
2635640	2636640	No, no.
2637400	2639400	No, no.
2639400	2644240	I used to, when I was a real little kid, I would do like little shows, like, and I would
2644240	2650280	like, because I like, I just liked the, you know, like, everyone would, you'd force people
2650280	2655040	to gather around and you would do, I would do like magic tricks and like Carson bits
2655040	2660200	that I didn't understand and, and, and it was, it was like, yeah, I wanted the attention
2660200	2665760	and I wanted to be funny, but, and yeah, I was like, I didn't understand what humor was
2666480	2669080	because, you know, my dad was the funny one.
2669080	2671120	My dad was the one that made everybody laugh.
2671120	2678560	Like he would, like my dad would read, uh, uh, towards the night before Christmas and
2678560	2680560	then he'd do like commentary on it.
2680560	2689000	Like he'd be like, and then, uh, and then I put his finger on his nose and, uh, we'll
2689000	2690000	shut up the chimney.
2690000	2692480	I don't know how he got up the goddamn chimney.
2692480	2693480	He's so fat.
2693800	2695200	It sounded like he'd just make comments.
2695200	2697120	I'm making him sound a little lamer than he is.
2697520	2699440	Uh, but it would be like little, little comments.
2699440	2703400	Like, and then, uh, and then, and then I remember being like at a certain age, like
2703400	2705680	that puberty age, like I remember like, I want it now.
2705680	2706480	I want to do it.
2706480	2709360	I want to do it like after my dad just killed.
2709360	2712120	And it was like, we could have moved on to have hot cocoa and fucking been a happy
2712120	2714240	family, but I was like, no, me, no, me.
2714400	2718240	And like 11, you know, like, like a fucking adult, basically.
2718480	2723320	I'm like, like, like as big as a golden retriever, like, like, like hard to hit
2723320	2728000	with a whip, you know, like, and, and, and, and then like everybody.
2728000	2730360	And I was like, kind of made everybody like, no, me.
2730360	2732480	And I like went through it and made my own comments.
2732480	2735000	Like, whoa, boy, how do you get his fat butt up the chimney?
2735200	2738200	And I just, I remember distinctly my dad being like, what?
2738240	2740160	He's just my bits.
2740200	2744240	Like, I remember him, like, I remember him calling it out and being like, he's
2744240	2744840	just doing that.
2744840	2746280	I already did that bit.
2747240	2749960	He didn't call it a bit, but he was like, man, I just did that.
2750680	2754880	Yeah, it was kind of associated comedy with like a thing that I wished I could
2754880	2759080	do. I never really saw myself as a, other people would be laughing.
2759080	2763120	Like when I went to school, like then after a certain point, then people are
2763120	2764160	like, you're so funny.
2764160	2768560	And I'd be like, oh, shit, fuck classroom or cafeteria playground.
2768800	2769800	What was your stage?
2769840	2774880	Well, starting with just like, like two nerds in the back of the room because I
2774880	2777600	was a nerd, so I wasn't going to make anybody laugh.
2777640	2782040	Like, I was like, like just right in the back corner in the English class, like
2782040	2785440	mutter under my breath and be like, this is stupid.
2786240	2790120	And then like the kid next to me, who is also a nerd and crammed back to her, be
2790120	2791920	like, that's funny.
2792320	2798520	And then and then and then that kid started a comedy sports team at my high
2798520	2803760	school. And then and then and then I got into like drama and improv and forensics
2803760	2808960	and all that stuff and got and got a little more training in like, yeah, just
2808960	2813440	honestly, just just hit the back wall with your voice and just keep talking, even if
2813440	2816120	you don't have anything to say and just kind of exercise it.
2816120	2819360	And then and then and then we would do stuff and then the school would come and
2819360	2823120	then and then, you know, then and then strangers like in the school were like, oh,
2823120	2824120	you're funny.
2824720	2826480	You should be on Saturday Night Live.
2826480	2828040	And I'd be like, you didn't know what you're talking about.
2828040	2832160	You're dumb. But but this feels like power to me.
2832160	2833160	So I'll take it.
2834760	2840120	And yeah, that's the that's the story of becoming funny.
2840120	2843640	But never never my dad never was like, this guy's hilarious.
2843640	2844480	Yeah. Yeah.
2844480	2845840	I think that might be important, right?
2845840	2846720	Like the same with your dad.
2846720	2850520	You're kind of like he was he was like a heckler almost like or like an unbeatable
2850520	2855120	like, you know, it is I think so your dad's side of the family is funny.
2855120	2861600	I take it funnier than my mom's side at the risk of offending a bunch of very
2861600	2862600	unfunny people.
2869520	2872800	I've talked about my great grandma, Busha, who's now who's now passed.
2872800	2878520	I mean, she was funny in the sense that she was a probably a murderer and
2879720	2885080	and and and also like had several people attempted to murder her and she survived.
2885080	2888600	That's funny because she was really old like when she got her throat slashed and
2888600	2890720	she walked to the hospital with a towel wrapped around her neck.
2890720	2892560	I mean, funny, like weird.
2892560	2897280	Yeah, but not not a lot of humorists on that side.
2897280	2899960	Yeah. So when you met with when you would hang out with like,
2899960	2901920	do you ever hang out with your uncles on your dad's side?
2901920	2906000	When those guys got around, there is a potential joke circle because he's got
2906000	2909280	the funny gene, right? Am I right about that?
2909280	2911880	But were his were his brothers just like, we're not funny.
2911880	2915400	He's fine. Well, I think my dad's sister, half sister,
2915400	2919800	you know, she's very jocular, very funny, like like very outgoing,
2919800	2923120	like you got a bit. What's that?
2923120	2924720	You know, a bit she does.
2924720	2929280	No, I just mean, you know, gregarious, like like just just having fun,
2929280	2932680	you know, like like like at the party, like like like if something
2932680	2935600	if there's something fun to happen, like, you know, yes,
2935600	2939440	ending it and being fun and going with the flow about the funny stuff
2939440	2942560	and not being like a passive aggressive kind of like threshold guardian
2942560	2947240	about crazy craziness, just like moving with it and being like, that's funny.
2947240	2949400	Like she's not going to turn the room down.
2949400	2951760	She's going to keep it going. Right.
2951760	2954080	I just wonder, because when you, you know,
2954080	2957760	to answer your question about your dad is if he comes from funny people, too,
2957760	2961440	it's even more daunting when you're in a family situation to chip at the throne.
2961960	2965320	So like Thanksgiving and Christmases, you're trying to get in there
2965320	2969040	and sort of do your material, but you also have this dude
2969040	2971080	who is now surrounded by his team.
2971080	2973120	Was that anything, you know?
2973120	2976760	Now, I think I think I think with my dad at the risk of talking out of school
2976760	2980440	or whatever, like because I don't really know that much about the family tree
2980440	2981560	as it goes back beyond that.
2981560	2984440	But I get the impression that my dad and his siblings,
2984880	2987840	like they all have one thing in common.
2987840	2989640	Like some of them are crazier than others.
2989640	2992280	Some of them are are like more fun than others or whatever.
2992280	2995760	But all of them are kind of like I think there was a lot of trauma
2995760	2997920	and and and and anxiety.
2997920	3001480	And I think they all dealt with it by like really
3001480	3006840	chesting up and like being like either incredibly cynical
3006840	3009080	or incredibly like gregarious.
3009080	3013040	And in either in any case, like not going gentle into that good night
3013040	3016760	and just being like more kind of like, like, is that all you got?
3017360	3019280	God, like, fuck it.
3019280	3021360	Like, I think that's funny then kind of thing.
3021360	3024760	Like, it was more like I don't I don't think there was anybody hilarious
3025200	3027680	over them. I think quite the opposite.
3027760	3033520	I get the impression that that there was like bad people going up that chain
3033520	3036240	and that that's why they're like kind of like, you know,
3036240	3040320	I can take a punch kind of funny. Yeah, literally.
3043520	3044640	What about you, Heath?
3044640	3046160	What about me, Dan?
3046160	3047560	Who are you and your family?
3047560	3048960	Where do you fall in terms of funny?
3048960	3050800	When did you become filled with toffee?
3050800	3056360	When did. Well, Dan, never, never heard that before.
3056680	3058320	You never have a candy bar.
3058320	3059520	I don't have an answer about that.
3059520	3060800	I mean, candy bar comments.
3060800	3063240	It's the first time ever to hear that.
3063240	3065320	Are you used to siblings?
3065320	3069880	Too older. Oh, I'm nine years older than my brother.
3069880	3071760	Eleven years, I mean, nine years younger than my brother,
3071760	3074720	eleven years younger than my sister.
3074720	3076800	Definitely the funniest one in the family.
3076800	3079160	But that was not saying much.
3079160	3080640	Can you fuck them up at will?
3080640	3082040	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3082040	3084480	You're certainly the funniest one in my family. Yeah.
3085480	3088400	I am. I am.
3088400	3089280	Right back there.
3089280	3093600	My dad's funny, but it's like, no, it's sarcasm.
3093600	3096080	I mean, like
3098600	3100320	my brother and sister were two years apart,
3100320	3103000	so they would fight a lot like, you know, four year old
3103000	3104920	and six year old or three year old and five year old fight
3104920	3106920	like that kind of bullshit.
3106920	3109760	And there is a Siberian Husky dog.
3110120	3111400	I was yet to be born.
3111400	3113600	And my sister was calling my brother a butthole
3113600	3115600	and my dad was like, that is not a thing.
3115600	3117240	You don't use that word. Don't use that word.
3117240	3121000	And he finally picked up the dog ass end and like lifted its tail up
3121000	3122600	and was like, that's what you're calling your brother.
3122600	3123800	Is that a nice thing?
3123800	3126760	That's a real pretty thing, isn't it?
3126760	3128800	And that that that put an end to all of it.
3128800	3130240	That put all into the butthole.
3130240	3133600	All you needed to do is see a real, real asshole.
3134600	3136440	Yeah. Yeah.
3136440	3137880	That's real pretty, isn't it?
3137880	3139600	That's real pretty, isn't it?
3139600	3141800	It would be like that kind of.
3142800	3145160	And I do have one that I do.
3145160	3145800	We have a second.
3145800	3147240	What was the thing about the hose?
3147240	3149600	I remember something about the hose and mud or something.
3149600	3152880	No, no, no, it was dog shit and and throwing it.
3153120	3154400	So this was the story I was going to be out.
3154400	3160400	So so now we I'm now born seven, nine.
3160640	3162000	I don't know.
3162000	3166240	And we have a dog and I had to clean up a shit was the job that I had
3166240	3169640	to like scoop it, put it in a bucket and then throw it in the trash.
3169640	3171080	We had a fence in the backyard.
3171080	3174680	And I figured out like a lot faster to just throw it right over the fence
3174680	3176400	and to just a field, it was just a field.
3176400	3178000	It wasn't someone else's yard.
3178000	3180480	So my dad's over in one part of the yard.
3181640	3186040	Gardening and I'm scooping the shit and I'm like, I'm just chucking it, chucking it
3186400	3190080	like hard, hard, hard, like, oh, that's white and chalky going to fly.
3190080	3191520	Oh, dark, like fine.
3191520	3195360	And then I get to one that's fresh and not solid
3195600	3198320	and doesn't have the density to clear the fence.
3198320	3199320	And so it just like
3202160	3205040	across the fence and I froze
3206120	3210840	and my dad's like on the on his knees, like with a trowel and I see him freeze.
3220400	3222240	Oh, that's great.
3224720	3226200	See, that's great.
3226200	3227920	That's a work of art.
3228960	3230000	I don't know why.
3230000	3232760	I'm so glad you didn't do it the way I told you to do it.
3234040	3236640	That is it got honey, honey, get a marker.
3236640	3239040	We got a Picasso and just like fucking
3239920	3245040	paraded my eight year old self with this just blistering.
3245960	3250480	Like it would have hurt less if it were an actual pull a switch kind of thing.
3251320	3254080	It was an emotional switch.
3254080	3256840	You guys have any real early memories of straight up
3256840	3259280	eating cat shit out of the cat litter box?
3260840	3264280	I swear to God, I remember I have this like the biggest memory
3264280	3268880	of being like under the stairs playing in what I thought was like
3268880	3273240	another sandbox with like a brown car and like.
3276120	3280200	And my and the reason I remember it was be like someone,
3280240	3285320	either my brother or somebody coming up like, what the fuck are you doing?
3285640	3288640	I'm like, I'm playing in the sandbox.
3288640	3291680	Probably like a guy is just smoking it like a cigar.
3291680	3296880	See, there's such a and like everyone like the family meeting.
3297320	3300320	Like, so like no, I don't remember like anybody grabbing me and going,
3300320	3303520	come on, and it was just more like everyone get over here
3303800	3306920	and watch because it was probably time to argue about whose fault it was
3306920	3310040	that this happened, you know, like who's supposed to be watching Daniel?
3310280	3314640	He is in the fucking cat shit, eating it.
3316040	3320120	That that's not where shit eating came in.
3320120	3321320	Pickle Rick, is it?
3321320	3326840	Is that like, was that like a memory that found its way?
3326920	3331080	Because isn't that what the psychiatrist, it's family therapy and shit eating?
3331080	3333800	That's oh, oh, oh, no, I mean, is it?
3333920	3335840	I don't know. I mean, we're getting deep.
3335840	3337920	Yeah, I ate shit once when I was a kid.
3337920	3339120	And I.
3345600	3347720	You did you did you did you have a cat?
3350200	3352320	Three. So you definitely we.
3352320	3354520	Spencer, did you ever eat cat turds?
3354520	3357000	I feel like I don't know.
3357000	3360200	I feel like that, like someone of the kids,
3360200	3363240	like my parents told stories about that, and I don't know.
3363240	3367600	My I remember being in a bathtub and my brother pissing into my mouth.
3371160	3373920	Not really consensually, but
3374920	3378000	please join us on this very special family episode.
3379000	3381040	Jesus, Jesus.
3381040	3385000	Was it was it was it like?
3385400	3389520	Was it were you going stop don't or was he like,
3389960	3392920	were you so young that he was like, I was going to stop don't
3392920	3397160	because I was taking a bath and I did not want the bathtub to be urinated in.
3398560	3401280	I wasn't even thinking that it might go into my mouth.
3402280	3404800	I just already saw that trouble was a Bruin.
3408080	3412040	But yeah, no, he pissed in my mouth and I just I remember
3412040	3414560	and I can't not remember, but my parents told me
3414560	3416680	because it's the funniest thing to them.
3416680	3418240	And yeah, it's probably funny.
3418240	3423400	But like I was like, it's it's warm and it's sour.
3423520	3425240	It's real bitter.
3425240	3428280	Just like just live commentating the experience.
3428480	3435320	Like I stopped screaming to commentate, I demand a boycott.
3436760	3439520	That happened.
3439520	3443200	Hashtag peeing in my mouth is over party.
3445080	3447280	Was there any sort of payback?
3447280	3450200	No, I was a good person.
3450200	3454600	I didn't pee in things that, you know, would cause problems for people.
3455320	3456880	It was great.
3457600	3462800	I cut the tail off of one of my like a rubber whale toy
3462800	3466800	that my brother, I turned out to have a lot of affection for.
3466800	3468320	I remember that.
3468320	3470720	But I think it's because and I think I was just a kid.
3470720	3473880	I was so young that I was just like playing with scissors
3473880	3476480	and was I didn't understand permanence or anything.
3476480	3479040	I just like cut this rubber thing.
3479040	3483400	And then my but I remember my brother like revealing how valuable
3483400	3485200	that rubber whale was.
3485200	3490040	And I remember thinking like, fuck you, a rubber whale.
3490040	3491560	That's like your thing.
3491560	3492640	Like, this is your thing.
3492640	3495520	Spiderman's your thing, motherfucker.
3495520	3497960	I know, because I cut his head off.
3500040	3503720	But I had to it had to be hard to have a little brother like, you know,
3503920	3505000	I'm sure it can't be.
3505000	3505960	It's not easy.
3505960	3508200	But, you know, like siblings don't have to fight and stuff.
3508200	3509320	I like Cody's sister.
3509320	3512840	She like she's got she's got two kids and like it's yeah.
3512840	3516160	I've been I've been reading or listening to these books about optimism
3516160	3520480	and happiness and how like because, you know, my therapist told me, OK,
3520480	3522960	so you're happy now, maybe.
3522960	3524720	So maybe are you going to drink yourself to death
3524720	3526880	or are you going to be actually you're going to have a good life?
3526880	3530520	And part of it is like, I don't I there's a and I think this is endemic
3530520	3533760	to our society, which is kind of a nice thing about us.
3533760	3538360	But like we don't think we think happiness is like, well, there's got to be
3538360	3541960	you know, we're cynical about it, which is not to say that, oh, everyone
3541960	3543320	should be happy.
3543320	3546000	But it's like we have an attitude about happiness where we're like,
3546640	3550000	if it's if you if you if something seems happy, then you got to.
3550240	3552680	It's more real to get to the
3554040	3559320	unhappiness underneath it like the we just sort of it's sort of built
3559320	3564120	into us to think that tragedy is reality because makes sense.
3564120	3565400	Life ends in death.
3565400	3567480	And then comedy is fake.
3567480	3569680	Happiness is fake.
3569680	3573440	This is a popular opinion now among our our little Nazi friends.
3573440	3576280	They have this virtue signaling like phrase that they use
3576280	3580080	if you're trying to help help somebody out or just say a nice thing
3580080	3583520	or or a supportive thing or or an anti-fascist thing.
3583520	3585440	It's like, oh, you're virtue signaling
3585440	3589640	because the idea is if you're if you're positive about something,
3589640	3593080	if you're hopeful or optimistic or called to action, then you're
3593600	3595280	there's there's a fake reason for it.
3595280	3601080	We even like mythologize our our our cultures like artists and pioneers.
3601080	3606680	We we say things like, oh, so and so invented the this and that.
3607320	3610480	And then their their biography will come out and it'll say,
3610800	3614080	which means he must have really wanted his father's approval.
3614600	3617640	Like we love getting to the bottom of the stuff and making it
3617640	3621640	like more like gritty and dirty and and real.
3622000	3623880	Otherwise, we don't believe it's real.
3623880	3627320	And so and so, you know, you you sign a deal
3627320	3630640	to do 70 episodes of your favorite show, like you've been waiting
3630640	3632120	for a really long time to have job security.
3632120	3635960	It's like a little bit of a obstacle you hit there where you're like, OK,
3635960	3638280	so I have everything I've ever wanted.
3638280	3641440	OK, so now I'm like, you know, I'm hitting like a vapor lock here.
3641440	3643200	I'm like, well, then what's wrong?
3643200	3645640	Like it's all football Nazis are taking over America.
3645640	3649320	That helps like like seems this is this is fitting.
3649320	3652320	This makes sense to me like God would do this to me.
3652320	3658000	Or I can always just find a lump in my, you know, wherever like like that.
3658000	3660480	That'll happen or, you know, we can't control that.
3660880	3662360	You start dwelling on that stuff.
3662360	3666360	You're like, like I swear every time my agents or lawyers are on the phone now,
3666360	3669600	I used to get excited and now I'm like, oh, God, OK, here it is.
3669600	3674160	Here it is. I'm going to find out that I hit a baby with my car or something.
3674160	3676400	Like I don't know about it. They found it in the bumper.
3678480	3681600	I wish I wish I had reps that cared that much.
3683280	3686000	Or they're just going to be like, oh, we're going over this contract
3686000	3687760	that we're still working on for Rick and Morty.
3687760	3692240	And did you know that the guy that you were talking to on the phone
3692240	3695280	the whole time was escaped from an asylum?
3695280	3696960	Like like just some some shoe will drop.
3696960	3698640	It was just me. This is all fake.
3698640	3703040	It was just, hey, did you have Heath in your phone as a white class?
3703040	3705760	Oh, Cartoon Network. It's going to be a sweet contract, don't worry.
3707520	3711960	But there's an I'm reading this book like I'll be with this guy.
3711960	3715160	I don't know if I, you know, if I remove the threat, not I.
3715160	3716520	I think you remove the threat.
3716520	3719480	People will find another threat because it's part of our wiring.
3719480	3722120	I should give some credit where it's due in case anybody wanted to.
3722120	3723480	You know, it's like a short book.
3723480	3725400	There's this thing called Authentic Happiness.
3725400	3731720	Who is it by this guy? Seligman, Martin Seligman.
3731720	3735080	He's like a guy that was like it's like like there was a there was a turning point
3735080	3739400	in the psychology industry where I think it was this guy Seligman, I think,
3739400	3741720	or or maybe it was some other guy, but who cares?
3742920	3749320	There was some guy that was like sort of like famous for standing up at a big seminar for
3749320	3750920	all the shrinks in the world.
3750920	3752600	Like they would always have their big organizations.
3752600	3756200	And he and this guy got up one year and said, look,
3757000	3759400	we've gotten really good at diagnosing mental illness.
3759400	3762920	We've gotten really good at we're doing great business.
3762920	3765240	Like the world is crazier than ever.
3765320	3772040	Yeah, it doesn't mean we're fucking up like like like our we have we all bought into the
3772760	3776200	myth that that that happiness is impossible.
3776200	3778120	Like are we also fucking miserable?
3779320	3781320	Are we not supposed to be making people happy?
3781320	3782280	We have cured nothing.
3783160	3784440	We're not doing anything.
3784440	3788920	Like if we were real, if we if being sad was a broken arm,
3788920	3792920	we would be the worst medical industry in the history of culture.
3792920	3794520	And people are like, boo, you suck.
3794520	3796120	And he's like, see, that just proves my point.
3796120	3797160	No, I'm kidding.
3797160	3800520	I don't think anything that interesting ever happens in a second psychology seminar.
3800520	3803720	But but but he kind of he made waves, you know,
3803720	3806760	and I'm sure by waves, I mean, like a bunch of people tenting their fingers and
3808200	3812760	cursing their lips and like writing scribbling marks down, hoping that he'll get insecure.
3814120	3820200	But he was he was he was he then that sparked this kind of wave of psychotherapy that was like,
3820200	3823880	like, what if our what if our goal was happiness?
3823880	3825720	What if we just experimented with that?
3826280	3830120	And and I think that's where cognitive behavioral therapy comes in and stuff like,
3830120	3831240	is this working for you?
3831240	3832680	If not, you know, changing all that crap.
3833880	3837400	It's interesting, I already like took some weight off my shoulders where they get is
3837400	3842840	there's like, like, like the idea of like, like, like, you know, like, like,
3843640	3845720	happiness is a yeah, it's a privilege.
3845720	3847720	It's like a good thing that you have it.
3847720	3853320	But like, if you have more of it than your immediate surroundings,
3853320	3857640	you it's not necessarily because something unfair is happening.
3857640	3863080	It's like you're lucky, but you're not necessarily it's not necessarily because you're rich,
3863080	3868760	for instance, because it's just all this science that goes into it like, like, like, like, oh,
3868760	3870920	who's happier, rich people or poor people?
3870920	3872520	It's like, yeah, they're there.
3872520	3878120	They even who then there's like these weird kind of differences.
3878120	3882440	Like, as much as I'm sure scientists didn't want this data to come in this way.
3882440	3888200	The truth is people that have a religion, they they're, they're a little happier.
3888200	3891000	They live a little longer, I think, and they they're a little happier.
3891000	3892280	It's data you collect it.
3892280	3895240	It's not enough of a difference that we should all run out and join a cult.
3896520	3900600	You there's like, there's like strange what you'd think is almost arbitrary,
3900600	3901320	like things.
3901320	3906040	And then there's all these other factors that you would assume are like, oh, well,
3906040	3907160	that would affect your happiness.
3907160	3910600	And it's like, no, that's that's nothing that's negligible.
3910600	3911560	And then there's it.
3911560	3916040	But I just like hearing it broken down to numbers because it demystifies it.
3916040	3919160	Like, I have this religious fear of being happy.
3919160	3924680	I really think that if I'm over 50% happy, and I took this I took this online thing,
3925000	3931000	my happiness index is three point one to the McDonald's survey.
3934120	3934600	Who was that?
3934600	3935720	What was who did this survey?
3935720	3936280	Do you know?
3936280	3938520	It's like something on the site that goes with this book.
3938520	3941800	It's like they get kind of you can go there and you can like you just fill in a couple
3941800	3942520	questions in there.
3942520	3945160	They're kind of taking your data because they want like more data from.
3946520	3948200	But it's like between zero and five.
3948200	3949400	I'm like three point one two.
3949400	3950520	It's like all the bar.
3950520	3954600	It's like, oh, how much happier are you than people that are your age?
3954600	3956760	It's a 50% people in your income.
3956760	3959240	50% people your gender 50.
3959240	3961160	I'm like right in the middle.
3961160	3961560	Okay.
3961560	3965560	There's the three I was gonna ask you is the three on the good meaning side or the
3965560	3966760	bad meaning side?
3966760	3967880	I assume the good.
3967880	3968120	Yeah.
3968120	3968440	Okay.
3968440	3969400	Yeah.
3969400	3969640	Yeah.
3969640	3970920	I don't think star meter.
3970920	3972280	I don't think it's like all.
3974440	3978600	But it's like it is fascinating because we're trying to figure out how much of
3978600	3981240	it we should actually have in order to keep going.
3981240	3985080	So I think people study their happiness and depression because they really want to relate.
3985080	3986360	How much can I accomplish?
3986360	3988760	Oh, and here's a here's a really interesting about happiness.
3988760	3992600	Like everybody that you ask, like, do you want to be happy?
3992600	3993720	Obviously the answer is yes.
3993720	3995240	Only one idiot would say no.
3995240	4000760	But but everybody that you ask, uh, if I were to give you a magic wand that you could point
4000760	4005320	at your head and make yourself happy, would you, everyone starts arguing.
4005320	4008280	Like everyone's like, well, no, no, not like that.
4008360	4009480	It's really interesting.
4009480	4011320	People don't just want to be happy.
4011320	4013800	People want to people want gratification.
4013800	4016280	They want to earn their happiness.
4016280	4023240	They want to feel accomplishment, which is where the, uh, uh, it makes all these scientific
4023240	4028120	cases for like anthropologically, like why happiness, which has long since been dismissed
4028120	4033720	as like just a byproduct of emotional thinking that we need to feel anger and we need to feel
4033720	4035000	fear in order to survive.
4035000	4036680	You need to be like, oh shit, there's a leopard.
4036680	4042760	Oh, you know, like I'm mad at you for taking my banana and and that then happiness is just
4042760	4046360	like, oh, no one's taken my banana right now and there's no lion.
4046360	4050280	But it's like he's made, he makes the case that no, happiness is like the thing.
4050280	4053800	It's like, because it makes you, I can't even, I wouldn't do a good job of selling it,
4053800	4056680	but it's like, you hear it and you go, shit, this could be scientific.
4056680	4059640	You could be like Asperger's about being happy.
4059720	4064920	Like being, being like, like, like, like into it, you could, you could, you could, you could,
4064920	4066760	you could turn being happy into Minecraft.
4066760	4070200	You could like try to knock it out, you know, like organize it and like do it right.
4070200	4071640	And you wouldn't be cheating.
4071640	4075880	You wouldn't be like, you know, destined to have an anvil fall on your head.
4075880	4079720	And, and, and, and, and then like a mountain climber, like she talks about the difference
4079720	4083800	between pleasure and ha and, and gratitude and gratification.
4083800	4089960	So we're like, like a mountain climber is like, is, is, is happy because they're like,
4089960	4092200	they're climbing a mountain, but it's fucking hard.
4092200	4095640	And then like, there's a point where they're like going to fall off the mountain and they,
4095640	4097560	they, they're, they're not dumb.
4097560	4100280	They wouldn't be like, I hope I fall off this mountain.
4100280	4101880	They're like, I hope I don't.
4101880	4107880	And I wish I, I wish I, I wish this rope was working better or whatever, you know,
4107880	4111320	like they can have regrets about their situation and wish that it would,
4111320	4113480	and hope that it like goes better.
4113480	4116200	But that's different from being like, I wish I'd never climb this mountain.
4116200	4119240	I mean, they, they knew climbing my mountain is a bunch of fucking hard work.
4119240	4124920	And they chose to like, but they, they were pursuing this like happiness high that they
4124920	4129320	knew would only come if they like, if they did all this shit that was hard.
4129320	4132920	And there's a big difference between like, well, for instance, playing Minecraft,
4132920	4133800	which isn't hard.
4133800	4137080	It's like a comfort thing for me or like eating a Twinkie or, you know,
4137080	4139960	like just, there's nothing wrong with like pleasuring yourself, but you,
4139960	4143400	but pleasure is just like, we feel, we feel like it's fake.
4143400	4145080	We don't feel gratified by it.
4145080	4149080	Your mountain analogy is the same sort of money where people work really,
4149080	4152680	really hard to get a ton of money and then get a ton of things,
4152680	4154520	big houses and a lot of grounds.
4154520	4157800	And they're still not happy because it's the difference right between
4157800	4160280	gratification and actually being satisfied.
4160280	4162440	Yeah, there's all this, it's an interesting read.
4162440	4165640	I mean, I mean, I've got the book on tape and I only listened to it.
4165640	4167000	It's like a couple hours.
4167000	4168440	And at the end, I was like, that's it.
4168440	4169320	Fuck this book.
4169400	4175800	But, but, but, but the first half I thought was really interesting and throw a
4175800	4176840	lot of science at you.
4176840	4179960	It might, if it, if it, if it helps demystify, I think we get,
4179960	4183160	I think smart people getting a funk about, about, about happiness.
4183160	4185240	And then we, we, we are suspicious of it.
4185240	4187960	There is this thing that we take it for granted, the way we take for granted
4187960	4191000	that rich kids don't have a hard time growing up with money.
4191000	4194440	So we just sort of assume that if your parents have money and you have money,
4194440	4196760	you know how to keep it, you know, make it, you know, earn it, you know,
4196760	4199000	the value of it, but it is not true.
4199320	4200840	There should be sort of a course.
4200840	4204840	And there's no question that, you know, people who, if you want to be unhappy
4204840	4208760	and you want to hit all the points that make people scientifically less happy.
4208760	4213320	One of the top things is live in an autocratic third world like a country
4213320	4216280	that where, where like you have no freedom and like there's,
4216280	4220520	there's less nutrition and there's less, less like wealth and there's less like,
4220520	4225080	there's more like those people are made unhappy by that environment.
4225080	4230280	So it's not, it's like poverty does make you unhappy because you're being deprived
4230280	4233800	of fucking shit that an ape would have in the wild.
4233800	4240280	I mean, you're being deprived of like, like really like minimum levels of like comfort
4240280	4241960	and emotional comfort.
4241960	4244360	Like, like, do I belong in this family of apes?
4244360	4246520	Like, like, are these people cool with me?
4246520	4249160	If you're sleeping in a sidewalk, you're like more bummed out.
4250120	4253160	So, so, you know, I thought there was a documentary that was like, yeah,
4253160	4255560	it tops out like the way the guy says it is like, if you,
4255560	4258200	if you could afford this book, you've, you've, you've,
4258200	4261320	you're past the threshold where money affects your happiness.
4261320	4263560	Like, you're, you're, you're, you're, it's,
4263560	4266920	it only works to like 70 grand a year or something.
4268120	4269880	Anyways, go fuck yourself, everybody.
4275160	4276200	Yeah, yeah.
4276200	4279560	And then he talks about how to, how to be happy in relationships
4279560	4281000	and have kids and stuff or whatever.
4281000	4284600	Like, I guess your kid, I guess your kids, you're supposed to like,
4284600	4287240	let them do shit and like not yell at them and stuff.
4288360	4292600	Like, but, and I would normally not believe it like the way he talks about kids,
4292600	4296600	but I said like Cody's sister, like everything I hear the guy saying,
4296600	4299960	I'm like, oh, that's how your sister, that's how she's raising her kids.
4299960	4302680	That's why they're like, and then the sibling rivalry thing,
4302680	4303720	which we take for granted,
4303720	4306440	we think that siblings are supposed to like resent each other.
4306440	4310520	And, but it's not really a, it's not a, it's a, it's a, it's a,
4311240	4315160	it's a pervasive thing, but it's not, it's not a natural thing.
4315160	4316600	It's not necessary.
4316600	4317320	What?
4317320	4317880	What is it?
4319640	4322360	You don't have to like be mad at your brothers and sisters
4322360	4323960	just because they're older or younger than you.
4323960	4327400	Like that's the, it's not, it's not, it's not a thing that just happens.
4327400	4331240	Like, because your babies, why does it happen?
4331240	4333720	It happens because there's a milk.
4333720	4337480	Like, I hate to throw 90% of American families under the bus,
4337480	4341560	but it happens because it happens because of a trickle down of like a culture of like
4341560	4343800	the parents expect it to happen.
4343800	4345400	They go like, be nice to your sister.
4345400	4348200	Like, it's just that everything is like, it's not based on,
4349240	4352200	they're setting norms that it's normal for them to fight like that.
4352200	4353640	And so they're taking a share.
4353640	4357720	And I don't know, it just, it just has everything to do with like the nuances of like,
4357720	4359800	are you, are you projecting onto your kids?
4359800	4361560	Like they're going to pick up from you.
4361640	4362840	Oh, I'm like a hockey team.
4362840	4364520	And my sister's like a different hockey team.
4364520	4370440	Like they just, you just, you put it onto them on accident because you learned it that way.
4370440	4372040	I always felt like it's because we're close.
4372040	4373080	We're all in the same car.
4373080	4374120	We're all in the same house.
4374120	4374760	We're going to fight.
4375880	4377000	Yeah, I would have thought so too.
4377000	4380120	I mean, and, and, and, you know, it's not like unhappiness is a myth.
4381160	4384440	It's not like it doesn't fall out of trees and stuff, but like I,
4384440	4387720	it is comforting to feel like, oh yeah, but happiness is like kind of,
4388600	4390440	it's easier for some people than others.
4390440	4392760	And then like some people have to work for it a little bit more,
4392760	4397000	but it's like a thing that you could just decide to be kind of like,
4397000	4399000	that sounds, that sounds very naive and privileged.
4399000	4400040	That's, that's, that's the truth.
4400040	4401080	That's the sheer trigger.
4401080	4404040	It's not, it's not because there's this thing that says like, you know,
4404040	4405480	you can decide when you want to be happy.
4405480	4408360	And people scoff at that because they're like, well, what if you're in a jail cell?
4408360	4411000	What if you're whatever, what if you're an auto press person?
4411000	4415640	But the truth of the matter is so much great art and life and joy comes out of slumps,
4415640	4416120	to be honest.
4416120	4419400	So there's, it's obvious that happiness doesn't know geography.
4419400	4423560	It doesn't know any sort of social class because if we can't get access to museums,
4423560	4425000	somebody's going to spray paint something.
4425000	4426360	If we can't get access to instruments,
4426360	4429000	somebody's going to figure out a way to put two turntables together.
4429000	4433400	Like people always figure out a way to bring joy regardless of, you know,
4433400	4435640	where or how bad it truly is.
4435640	4437400	Especially the streets.
4437400	4437800	Hit it.
4440280	4441400	Minor always, you know,
4441400	4461000	yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4461720	4464360	Flying high, flying low.
4464360	4466680	I fucked your mama like a bowl of jello.
4467000	4474680	Oh, fucked her in her face.
4477720	4483240	Just maybe, uh, maybe kick a little something in, in honor of your fake dad.
4483960	4485160	Oh yeah.
4485160	4485480	Okay.
4485480	4485720	Yeah.
4487160	4491320	Yo, yo, this one goes out to pops, big pops.
4491320	4493640	My dad, he feel free to jump in.
4493640	4495800	He feel free to jump in with a pop.
4496280	4499000	You can even pass it back and forth on the A and B rhymes.
4499720	4500520	You know what I'm saying?
4500520	4501000	Oh damn.
4501000	4505560	I'm just curious though, what is it about my rapping that had no limitations on it
4505560	4507960	that made you think what I needed was limitations?
4509560	4513320	Oh, maybe you should, maybe you should draw boundaries around your...
4513320	4516440	Just make sure that you have gotten enough sleep before you rhyme.
4517160	4518200	It's important.
4518200	4521560	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
4522680	4529960	Combs, hair, sky, air, eyeballs, nose.
4529960	4532360	I fucked your mama and then I smelled a rose.
4533240	4535080	I put my shoes on tight.
4535080	4537640	I fucked your mama all day and all night.
4537640	4543000	I put my suspenders on and I rolled around and made an angel on the lawn out of clippings
4543880	4545240	that I just mowed.
4545240	4547320	I fucked your mama when it was 10 below.
4548760	4549640	I warmed her up.
4550200	4552520	I fucked your mama and then I drank a cup.
4553480	4554840	It was my own cum.
4557960	4559480	Straight Rod Stewart.
4561320	4562440	I drank my own cum.
4565160	4566920	I love to drink my own cum.
4570280	4573080	And now you ask why I thought you might have some limitations.
4575240	4581480	Yeah, well, that's enough, I think, for now.
4589160	4592120	Oh, Affinity Designer came out for the iPad.
4592680	4594120	Just very excited about that.
4594120	4595160	What's that like?
4595160	4597480	I said the ongoing drama, the Schwab drama.
4598120	4598840	Schwab drama?
4598840	4600680	Yeah, there's a Schwab iPad drama.
4600680	4603800	Oh, I don't know, Schwab got some old ass iPad from Kevin Day,
4604760	4606680	and he tried to high road me with it.
4606680	4608440	I could see it was like a legacy iPad.
4610280	4611320	Shots fired!
4611320	4615720	Yeah, I mean, like, fucking Schwab.
4616520	4617560	And where has Schwab been?
4619000	4622600	He came and he campaigned and he got a first-class ticket to Long Island,
4622600	4624600	and then he just boned out.
4625800	4629960	He's probably trying to unload Scud t-shirts in Boston or something.
4631320	4632920	You know there was some scam to it.
4632920	4633640	Where is he?
4633640	4635000	Like, that friendship's not real.
4637880	4640200	He's always accusing me of being unfeeling,
4640200	4642040	and look how emotional I am.
4643240	4644040	Like, it's always me.
4644040	4645080	He's always putting it on me.
4645080	4646520	He's like, oh, the big joke.
4646520	4649320	Oh, Dan's so mean, and he's so unfeeling.
4651480	4652280	This was all hard.
4652280	4655560	But if that were true, you wouldn't be the one reaching out.
4655560	4657240	Yeah, yeah.
4657240	4658840	You want me to text Rob that I want an Emmy?
4658840	4659720	Yeah.
4659720	4660360	Got nominated?
4661160	4662360	Let him know, let him know.
4662360	4663800	Leave a voicemail.
4669720	4671400	Oh, well, let's bring Steve Levy up.
4671400	4672200	Steve Levy!
4677640	4678920	Steve Levy, ladies and gentlemen.
4683000	4683880	What's happening?
4683880	4686040	Hey, Steve, what's up with the 20 empty seats?
4686040	4687080	Should we stop doing the show?
4688200	4689640	No, we should keep doing the show.
4690280	4691720	As the audience dwindles?
4692520	4693880	I think, yeah.
4696600	4697480	For this show, yeah.
4697480	4699720	It seems like our numbers are missing.
4699720	4701480	Well, should we target like a year, though?
4701480	4703320	Because of the subscriptions?
4703720	4705720	Because if we're going to stop doing the show,
4705720	4707960	we have to decide a year in advance.
4707960	4710280	Yeah, that's on you, I think, right?
4710280	4710520	Yeah.
4712600	4714360	I don't like to be dramatic about stuff,
4714360	4717560	but I can't afford to, like, I don't have the option
4717560	4719960	of just being like, following my bliss with the show.
4720520	4724200	So we have to decide, like, now-ish if we want to like,
4724200	4727080	oh, let's spend this year wrapping things up,
4727080	4728600	because then the subscriptions, like,
4728600	4729640	six months from now we can go,
4729640	4731400	okay, no more six-month subscriptions.
4734040	4736440	All right, well, I'll get one more week,
4736440	4738680	and then I'll make an official,
4738680	4741080	like, Jeff should be here for a decision.
4741080	4741800	Yeah, I think so.
4741800	4744360	Not that I'm going to let any, I'm not going to take a vote.
4746200	4748360	I'm the one that has to be here every fucking week.
4749240	4752600	Like, everybody else is like, aww.
4765320	4766600	This place is cutthroat.
4769480	4771160	I actually need that, no joke.
4772120	4774360	It's not funny, Dad.
4774360	4780920	What do you think, Spencer, in terms of the D&D business?
4780920	4781560	What do you think?
4782120	4783320	Whatever you guys want, man.
4783320	4784200	You always say that.
4784200	4785080	Let's do it.
4785080	4785560	What about you?
4785560	4786520	What do you want?
4786520	4787800	I want to play D&D.
4787800	4788280	Aww.
4793080	4794600	Let's do it for the people at home.
4796280	4798120	The people at home.
4800520	4802440	Does it make you happy, Spencer?
4805240	4808520	I don't know if that makes me happy.
4809960	4812040	It certainly makes me feel wanted.
4815400	4815960	Looks like we need to-
4815960	4819560	That's a big part of the biological necessity of happiness,
4819560	4820760	or whatever, the drive for it.
4820760	4822200	Because it has to do with, like,
4822840	4825240	if your happiness is like this, like,
4825240	4827160	Velcro that holds a tribe together.
4827160	4830440	Because, like, and they immediately, the first thing they did
4830440	4835240	is they were like, oh, is it just cute people?
4836120	4837880	Are people that are attractive just happy?
4837880	4840120	Because everyone likes them and has nothing to do with happiness?
4840120	4841480	Like, is there just another factor?
4841480	4843640	And they had to eliminate all that stuff
4843640	4845960	in some very uncomfortable experiments, I'm sure.
4847320	4848120	Excuse me, sir.
4848120	4851000	Would you like to answer some questions about your life?
4851560	4852120	Why?
4852120	4853480	Well, you seem very happy.
4855400	4855960	Okay.
4855960	4859560	Why am I in a room full of half-handsome people?
4861400	4861880	Which one?
4862520	4864120	Because maybe you're handsome.
4864120	4864680	I don't know.
4867400	4869320	Why am I sitting on the other side of the room
4869320	4872920	with a lot of ugly people who are all so happy?
4874760	4876440	Why are the beautiful people frowning at us?
4880440	4881400	Happiness.
4881400	4883000	You know about those carrier pigeons?
4885160	4887160	I've been listening to this podcast.
4888040	4889720	No, no, no, go on.
4889720	4890760	Not so easy, is it?
4890760	4892760	I've been listening to this podcast, Business Wars.
4892760	4894360	You guys know about the Business Wars?
4894360	4894920	All the time.
4894920	4895800	Oh, yes.
4895800	4898280	There are some good wars between those businesses.
4898280	4905240	There's Netflix and Blockbuster and Adidas and Nike and Marvel and DC.
4905240	4907240	Some really fun companies.
4907240	4912440	And right now, they're doing Hearst versus Pulitzer
4912440	4914680	and the news business back in the day.
4914680	4918760	You're talking about all-time corporate rivalries, like 30 for 30.
4918760	4919800	It's about corporate.
4919800	4920600	Right?
4920600	4920920	Yeah.
4921560	4923000	It's a really fun podcast.
4923000	4927640	Anyway, today, they're talking about carrier pigeons.
4929000	4931960	Which is what you put in rock stars versus the gun?
4933080	4935240	Versus the cell phone.
4936200	4942520	Hearst invested heavily in pigeons that would actually carry messages throughout New York City.
4942520	4945640	They would go 90 miles per hour and know exactly where to go.
4945640	4951160	And there was this big trial that they were trying to get the scoop on before Pulitzer.
4951160	4953240	Where did you come from before this, man?
4953240	4953560	What?
4956200	4957480	I just found it fascinating.
4957480	4958760	What were you doing backstage?
4960520	4963720	You know, catching up some work, listening to some podcasts.
4965560	4966040	I don't know.
4966040	4967320	That's crazy.
4967320	4970520	You know, the rock towns also use carrier pigeons.
4970520	4971720	You don't give a shit about what I'm...
4971720	4971960	Okay.
4973640	4974200	Rock time.
4974200	4975080	I'm trying to help you.
4976360	4980520	I'm trying to talk about 1930s New York railroad barons.
4982840	4984360	You think I wanted to do this?
4984360	4986360	Just try to put a smile on your face.
4986360	4986840	Yes.
4986840	4991400	So to cosign what you are saying, the rock tiles also use carrier pigeons.
4991400	4992600	You work to...
4992600	4993560	But they're extinct.
4994120	4994920	How did this happen?
4994920	4996280	They went out of business.
4996280	4997080	They went out of business.
4997080	4998040	1910s.
4998040	4998440	I don't know.
4999880	5001960	You know what else about optimism and happiness?
5002600	5003560	Martin Luther King.
5005640	5008040	His branding optimism.
5008040	5009480	Use your I statements.
5009480	5013560	Like I heard that Ted talk or the talks about the effectiveness of leaders and stuff.
5013560	5014600	Martin Luther King.
5014600	5017000	Why was his branding so effective?
5017000	5020360	He wasn't the first guy to notice things were bad and all that stuff.
5020360	5025160	He used his I statements and he said, I believe, I have a dream.
5025880	5028200	His speech wasn't called, I have a plan.
5028200	5033640	Or, you know, I have 10 rules about how everyone should operate.
5033640	5035880	It was like, I have a dream.
5035880	5038920	And his dream was two kids holding hands.
5038920	5043240	And if you couldn't get behind that, then you're like, all right.
5043240	5044360	You're in the minority.
5044360	5046040	And most people are like, yeah.
5046040	5048840	Well, when you put it that way, I can access that.
5048840	5049720	It's like a vision.
5050600	5051720	That's what leadership is.
5051720	5053160	You go, I believe...
5053160	5059080	Like first, the most important thing, optimism is the opposite of pessimism.
5059080	5062760	Pessimism is the thing that infects you and it fucks everything up.
5062760	5067480	Everybody that's mad right now, they're like, they're pessimistic.
5067480	5070440	And so some people are moving to try to get behind the thing
5070440	5072280	that they're scared is going to happen.
5073000	5074600	Because no one wants to be a fool.
5074600	5076280	So they're like, okay, world's falling apart.
5076280	5078440	That's kind of what I've been doing, like hiding.
5078440	5081320	Like I don't want to be a loser in that battle.
5081320	5085080	So like, okay, let me scoot away and over here and stuff.
5085080	5088200	And then like, but optimism is the only thing
5088200	5091720	that's going to actually counter that sickness.
5092360	5095800	But it seems stupid to us, like optimists seem stupid to us
5095800	5099400	because they believe more crazy shit.
5100200	5101560	And they're actually less accurate.
5101560	5102680	They do these studies.
5102680	5105000	Oh, there's this study that was hilarious in the book.
5105640	5108760	So they take people and they put them in a room with a light switch
5108760	5111640	that straight up just works randomly.
5111640	5114360	So, and they go like, hey, turn on the light 20 times
5114360	5115480	or something like that.
5115480	5118680	And then the light switch is like programmed to just be random.
5118680	5122680	So like, it just, when you turn it on, sometimes it comes on.
5122680	5123480	Sometimes not.
5123480	5125800	When you turn it off, if it's on, sometimes it goes off.
5125800	5126520	Sometimes it doesn't.
5127160	5132280	The depressed people that they pre-screen for,
5132280	5134280	like you're depressed, come do this experiment.
5134280	5135320	They're like a control group.
5137240	5140440	They asked them like, hey, what was going on with the light switch?
5141560	5143560	And the depressed people nailed it.
5143560	5146040	They're like, well, it's fucking random is what it was.
5146040	5147800	Because I turned it on the first time.
5147880	5149240	And I was like, what the fuck's going on?
5149240	5149960	And so I tested it.
5150600	5152520	And they're like, clued in.
5152520	5153640	They get reality.
5153640	5157320	If you're depressed, you understand what's sad about the world
5157320	5158280	and what's not working.
5158280	5159880	You're like, finely tuned to it.
5160680	5164200	The happy people, they were like, what's up with that light switch?
5164200	5167240	And they're like, I know, 30% of the time it was just out of control.
5169800	5171320	They don't believe a conspiracy.
5171320	5175400	Yeah, they're just like, they're delusional.
5175880	5180520	And so there's a difference between that delusion
5180520	5182760	and being delusional about the things that matter.
5182760	5187400	Because the thing is, in terms of society, that delusion makes shit happen.
5187400	5189560	Right, and happy people go, that shit happens.
5189560	5191880	And depressed people go, that shit's happening to me.
5191880	5195560	Right, and yeah, and if everyone is depressed
5195560	5199320	and everyone is noticing how the light switch doesn't work,
5199320	5202680	when the light switch is a real light switch, that's incredibly helpful.
5202680	5203240	Thank you.
5203240	5205560	You're Vin Diesel in Pitch Black, thank you.
5205560	5208600	You can see things that I can't see.
5208600	5210360	Thank you for saving me from the monsters.
5210360	5212360	But this isn't a real light switch.
5212360	5214440	When you're talking about fucking democracy,
5214440	5219480	or you're talking about mankind deserving a chance against giraffes or asteroids,
5219480	5224440	you actually need that fucking Bill Pullman to get out there and be like,
5224440	5227240	hey, everybody, let's fight together the aliens.
5227240	5228760	There's no reason to do that.
5228760	5232440	If there's anybody that's sad out there, they're like, this is bullshit.
5232440	5236120	I'm flying away from the aliens because we're all going to die.
5236120	5239080	That person's correct, but not going to win.
5239080	5239800	All right, whatever.
5241560	5242200	You're exactly right.
5242200	5245800	It's kind of why they start with the first images of just straight bullshit.
5245800	5247320	So you kind of knew that this administration
5247320	5248760	was going to go after women and children first,
5248760	5250520	because that's the most shocking and jarring.
5250520	5253080	It's sort of designed to make you freak the fuck out.
5253080	5255640	So they show you the hardest of hard.
5255640	5258840	It's a little bit of a precursor to what's about to happen.
5258840	5259880	To wear you down.
5259880	5261560	But don't be.
5261560	5263080	We're not going to be worn down.
5263080	5265800	Well, I'm pretty worn down, but finally, I'm someone.
5269400	5272040	I was at home on my couch when I got this phone call.
5274040	5280760	Hey guys, I just wanted to step in and say, everybody be aware of guns.
5281400	5284680	Yeah. MC gun control.
5286600	5287960	Just a god set.
5291720	5292200	Hmm.
5292200	5293960	I've got I'm proud of our audience.
5293960	5295000	They're tired of that bit.
5297800	5298520	That was a test.
5298520	5299320	You guys passed.
5304680	5306040	Spencer, do you bring us up to speed?
5306040	5306680	Tell us where we're at.
5306680	5308040	What's been going on?
5308040	5308520	Yeah.
5311720	5312220	Oh.
5314600	5321720	Last time on Harmon Time, our heroes had just put out the fire.
5321720	5324120	And I think then they started another fire.
5326360	5327480	I'm not sure about that.
5327480	5328680	That might not have happened.
5329320	5332680	But they were certainly putting their foot back in it
5332680	5334920	and ended up escaping from the town.
5334920	5339080	But farmers were in hot pursuit after making it out
5339080	5340680	of the perimeter of the town.
5341240	5343400	They weighed up their options and decided
5343400	5346600	they were outnumbering the farmers and decided to attack.
5347560	5350840	Untrained, the farmers took several blows
5350840	5355000	and were instantly overwhelmed, but they fought valiantly.
5355000	5360200	And then Diarrhea Jr. threw a bunch of vampire dust in the air
5360200	5361640	and everyone started choking.
5362520	5364600	That's what's happening now.
5367160	5367880	All right.
5367960	5369400	Anyone got any questions?
5370040	5370920	I hope so.
5370920	5372440	I have no idea what's happening.
5372440	5373960	That's probably, yeah.
5373960	5377400	You're playing Schwab's character, Gary Shamblin.
5377400	5378680	You're like a swamp thing.
5380920	5381720	There it is.
5381720	5382200	Great.
5382200	5382920	Got it.
5382920	5383560	And the cut.
5384520	5385080	All right.
5385080	5386520	I wasn't listening to a lot of that.
5388520	5389640	What's Deconstruct?
5389640	5389960	Why?
5390600	5396760	I used the D&D opening to gather my thoughts about how the show went.
5396760	5397960	I may have called for it.
5397960	5400280	It's like my first chance in two hours to like go,
5401720	5403720	should we keep doing the show or not?
5403720	5405080	I'm thinking about a million things.
5405080	5406760	I call for it a little too early.
5406760	5407400	My apologies.
5408280	5410840	It was an awkward handoff and Spitzer picked it up.
5410840	5411960	No, it's not your fault.
5411960	5414200	No, it's that space of time that's like, it's just,
5414200	5416280	it's like a snow drift I have to pee on.
5416280	5417720	Like, it's like...
5417720	5418200	Oh, of course.
5419880	5423000	For 90 minutes, I'm like, it's up to me to,
5423000	5424760	okay, let's keep the show going.
5424760	5428280	You guys can tell how responsibly I take this job.
5429720	5431400	And then I hand it off to Spitzer.
5431400	5434840	And then I'm like, I just decompress into that space.
5434840	5436760	And Spitzer's talking about what happened.
5436760	5440200	And I'm just going like, all right, well, so get home tonight.
5442200	5443320	I'll let the dogs out.
5443320	5445480	And like, my life's going okay, isn't it?
5445480	5446200	Text your dad.
5446840	5448360	Do I enjoy myself here?
5448360	5448840	Are there?
5448840	5449800	So like, why?
5449800	5451240	What's with the empty seats?
5452680	5454200	It's your get ready space.
5454680	5457640	Like, what else can I rhyme with mouth other than south?
5459480	5463000	Okay, so maybe I heard, like, maybe we started some fires.
5463000	5464120	Well, I like that.
5464120	5466200	That actually made me feel a lot better
5466200	5468040	because that makes just perfect sense.
5469080	5471960	It's not like about me being bad at this.
5471960	5472920	Oh, God, no.
5472920	5473720	No, no, not at all.
5473720	5475480	As a matter of fact, let's get one more minute.
5475480	5475960	No, no.
5477000	5477720	That's the worst.
5477720	5479560	I mean, I appreciate the thought, but no,
5479560	5481000	that's the last thing I want right now.
5481880	5484360	I want to play games with my friends.
5490520	5491480	Let's get into it.
5491480	5492280	So we're right.
5492280	5493560	So you're outside of the town.
5493560	5494680	You ran away.
5494680	5495400	You were okay.
5495400	5498120	So you the town was fighting a fire and you were like,
5498120	5499720	well, we still got to find Patchens.
5499720	5502280	So then you went in and we're like, where's Patchens?
5502280	5504520	And they're like, well, there's a there's a fire.
5504520	5506360	And then you put out the fire.
5506360	5508440	And then you're asking for Patchens.
5508440	5509480	And they're like, weren't you guys,
5509480	5510840	the guys that start the fire?
5510840	5513080	And you're like, I think the winds are turning.
5513080	5515480	And then you you hightail it out of there.
5515480	5516840	But then you're being chased.
5516840	5519400	And you were running because you thought you were being chased
5519400	5520280	by an angry mob.
5520280	5522280	But the farther you got, the more turned out
5522280	5523320	to be just three people.
5523320	5524920	And then you're like, well, fuck this.
5524920	5527000	And then you felt bad because you just like,
5527000	5529720	you slash one of them in the cut or something.
5529720	5532200	You really started taking them to task.
5532200	5534280	And then it was just kind of sad because it's like,
5534280	5536520	well, they were just trying to do their jobs.
5537480	5543160	And that's what DJ threw the vampire dust in everyone's face.
5543160	5543880	And that didn't do it.
5543880	5545320	That just made everyone cough.
5545320	5547240	Yeah, it was just like dust.
5547960	5550040	But you know, you might have diseases now.
5550040	5553560	But if anything, it's like an ingredient for maybe
5553560	5555000	an invisibility potion.
5555000	5558120	Yeah, realistically, you did get rid of a magical reagent.
5558120	5558840	Yeah.
5558840	5559160	All right.
5560360	5561240	But that's fine.
5562440	5564360	So the farmers are all coughing.
5564360	5567000	And one of them is like on the floor bleeding half to death.
5571960	5572440	Oh.
5572440	5574200	A bear appears.
5574200	5577160	Is Brandon playing both Bernie Mac and Carl?
5577160	5579320	And I guess if you want, you can play both.
5581720	5582440	What was Jeff's?
5583800	5584680	I don't want to mess up Jeff.
5584680	5585240	Chad the Firelight.
5585240	5586200	Oh, no, mess it up.
5586200	5586840	It'll be great.
5586840	5587080	Great.
5587080	5588680	Chad here to play.
5588680	5589960	You like fire.
5589960	5590360	Awesome.
5590360	5596920	So I immediately stand up as Chad,
5596920	5600200	look around, and set my hula hoop on fire.
5601000	5601800	You do it.
5601800	5602440	You like it.
5603720	5604220	Okay.
5605720	5606680	To start.
5606680	5607240	Yeah.
5607240	5608600	I've got to find pachins.
5611960	5613160	Spencer's what?
5615240	5615560	What?
5615560	5616600	Ask me a question.
5616600	5617400	This is the game.
5617560	5618060	What?
5619160	5619400	Yeah.
5621400	5623000	How do we find pachins?
5623000	5624360	How do you find pachins?
5625720	5626040	Okay.
5630520	5635720	He's rolling to see just how many months he wants to go by.
5637720	5641960	You use your intelligence to determine that the best way to find pachins
5641960	5645640	is to ask if anyone's seen a strange mysterious child nearby.
5646600	5647560	Try recently.
5647560	5648600	Is he really a child?
5648600	5650360	Well, he's like a young...
5650360	5652600	I mean, you'd call him maybe 16 or something.
5652600	5655480	But by these people's standards, yeah, he's like a kid.
5655480	5656280	Oh, wow.
5656280	5661560	I always imagine him as like a 30-something, beard, sleepy kind of guy.
5661560	5663640	For me, at most, he was like 19.
5663640	5664120	Wow.
5664120	5665160	But yeah.
5665160	5665560	Sorry, what?
5665560	5669080	I just immediately went to dog having never been here before.
5669080	5672280	I could see how that connection could be made.
5672280	5674040	So his patches is a man.
5674040	5674520	Yeah.
5674520	5674920	Okay.
5674920	5679160	Well, a boy, a boy, not yet a woman.
5679160	5680920	I didn't get clarity on that.
5680920	5683960	I slashed one of the stomachs of one of these three people that was chasing us.
5683960	5686200	There's still some two of them like...
5686200	5687320	Yeah, but they're coughing.
5687320	5688920	That was like the last thing that happened.
5688920	5691640	So I grab one of them and I go,
5691640	5694600	listen to me or face the wrath of God.
5695240	5695640	All right.
5696440	5697160	You do that.
5697160	5699000	He seems stricken with fear.
5700280	5702200	Have you seen a strange child?
5703000	5708760	He goes, yeah, I think someone was wandering off just tonight.
5708760	5710920	I think it was right before the fire started.
5710920	5711720	Where?
5711720	5713240	Actually, after the fire started.
5713240	5713640	Sorry.
5714600	5715320	Where?
5715320	5716840	He went towards...
5718040	5718920	Sorry.
5718920	5720120	It's all right.
5720120	5721720	You can scroll through your memory.
5724760	5727560	He seemed to be going in the direction of Blade Glen.
5728280	5731240	It's a big, big city, one of the bigger cities around here.
5732600	5733640	Blake Glen?
5733640	5734840	Blade Glen.
5734840	5735560	Blade Glen.
5736200	5737000	Exactly.
5737800	5738280	Thanks.
5738840	5740440	Thanks for answering my question.
5740440	5742280	And then I turn to the other guy and I go,
5744200	5745800	would you have answered my question?
5748680	5750520	If I had focused my aggression on you.
5751240	5753000	He says, yeah, I would have,
5753000	5757320	but you guys got to come back and face justice for doing all the damage.
5757960	5758680	So here's...
5758680	5759640	I do one of these.
5759640	5760280	Here's the thing.
5761240	5765720	I go like, that sounds like a great idea.
5765720	5769640	And I put my foot around behind his ankles and I push him.
5769640	5774520	I just straight up third grade, just push him.
5774520	5778600	Into the guts, into the open guts of the guy that you slashed open.
5779800	5781240	He falls into the guts.
5782600	5783560	And I just laugh.
5783560	5787400	I go, you fucking nerd.
5787400	5788040	Jesus.
5788920	5790920	I'm not facing your justice.
5790920	5792680	I work for the fucking Lord.
5795640	5796680	That happens.
5796680	5798440	Too big to fail, baby.
5799720	5805720	I'm ignoring Carlos's bullying and focusing on Chad's amazing hula hoop skills.
5805720	5806920	With his, the fire.
5807480	5808520	It's just incredible.
5808520	5809800	He's blowing my mind.
5809800	5814680	I'm juggling rotisserie chickens and hula hooping on fire.
5814680	5815480	It's delicious.
5816200	5818840	The fire is terrifying me as a swamp thing.
5818840	5819560	Yes.
5819560	5822360	It's glorified by it, yeah.
5822360	5824120	I suggest that we move to another town.
5825080	5827000	To Blade Glen.
5829000	5830360	So I lead the pack.
5830360	5831400	We head out.
5831400	5835240	I am now doing those things, those fire lamps, like...
5836280	5837400	To guide our path.
5837400	5838760	Yeah, to guide a path.
5838760	5839240	Yes.
5839240	5841000	Who knew Chad was a fire dancer?
5841000	5843320	Oh, and I tell the two guys, I go,
5843320	5848200	I go, if you guys tell anybody in town that we went to Blade Glen,
5849880	5851640	your sister will explode.
5855480	5858600	They look at each other and then look at you and then look at each other.
5858600	5859560	Do they have a sister?
5859560	5860680	You have sisters, right?
5860680	5861640	Both of you do.
5861640	5862360	No, we don't.
5864360	5865400	That's right, you don't.
5866760	5867880	Not anymore.
5867880	5869560	Because they exploded in the womb.
5870200	5873080	And that's on you.
5875240	5876040	Pay it forward.
5877000	5877960	Does anyone...
5877960	5883080	Do either of you have a loved one whose name starts with D?
5885480	5886440	I'm hearing a D.
5888680	5889720	Nope, no D.
5890760	5892040	G, I think I'm hearing.
5893720	5895480	That's the middle name, the G.
5895480	5897320	A loved one is departed.
5897320	5899320	One of you has a departed loved one.
5899880	5900760	No, no G.
5901960	5904360	No one has a departed loved one.
5904360	5905720	Gregory? Is it Gregory?
5906280	5906520	No.
5908120	5909640	It doesn't work if you...
5912040	5913240	Sorry, I was getting into it.
5913960	5914600	Can you really...
5915800	5916920	It's a cold reading...
5918280	5920280	I just realized you need a bigger audience.
5920280	5921080	Sorry, sorry.
5921080	5923880	It's two people of a really high chance to deal with.
5923880	5923960	You're so talented.
5923960	5926280	I don't have a sister fucked up.
5927800	5928600	Well, here's the thing.
5929560	5930920	Let's do it the old-fashioned way.
5930920	5932840	You talk about where we went,
5932840	5934360	and we're gonna come back and beat you up.
5935160	5936200	You've seen I'm a bully.
5937800	5939720	You saw me laugh at you after I tripped you.
5940680	5945080	Like, if I were you, I wouldn't give me a chance to be mean.
5945080	5946200	Yeah, that makes sense.
5946200	5947000	Yeah, I love it.
5947960	5948440	Here's the...
5948440	5951160	Okay, let's try a little bonus here.
5951160	5953560	If you don't tell anybody for the next year,
5955480	5956680	you're gonna get a chocolate bar.
5958200	5959240	I love chocolate.
5959560	5959880	Not...
5963320	5963800	I'm gonna cut...
5963800	5964360	What's your name?
5964360	5965560	What's your name, sir?
5965560	5966040	Tron.
5967160	5968040	Tron?
5968040	5969960	Was your mother 16 when she had you?
5969960	5970120	No.
5974600	5976040	I'm sorry, we're laughing at you, but...
5980920	5982280	And what's your name, Tron's friend?
5982280	5983160	What's your name?
5983160	5983720	Ron.
5983720	5984760	Okay, Tron and Ron.
5985320	5986840	Jesus Christ, this town.
5987560	5990680	Tron and Ron, I'm remembering, I'm committing it to memory.
5990680	5992280	Oh, Lord.
5992280	5994040	Oh, Lord of the silver light.
5994040	5997880	If Tron and Ron keep their fucking mouths shut for a year,
5997880	6000040	give them all the chocolate bars.
6002040	6003240	That's a lock.
6003240	6004680	Why don't you do that prayer for us?
6004680	6006200	I want all the chocolate bars.
6009640	6010920	You guys are so lucky.
6013160	6014280	So long, Tron.
6014280	6015080	Bye, Ron.
6016840	6017080	Bye.
6018440	6019640	Are you gonna tell people?
6020280	6020760	No, no.
6020760	6021480	Okay, okay.
6022440	6024440	I feel like I believe them, do you guys?
6024440	6025080	Good work.
6025080	6026760	Sense motive on them, like...
6026760	6028440	All right, what's yours?
6029320	6031480	Might be insight or sense motive.
6031480	6032440	It's been lost.
6032440	6033480	Well, I don't really...
6033480	6035240	I don't think I have it as an actual...
6035240	6037160	Then wisdom, if you don't have it.
6037160	6038440	Wisdom is 16.
6039320	6039880	All right.
6040760	6041880	Oh, yeah, he's lying.
6044120	6044440	10.
6045000	6046040	So we are in trouble.
6046040	6047480	They're gonna tell people.
6047480	6050840	But the odds, I mean, nobody's gonna come after us.
6050840	6052200	You'd be gone by then, right?
6052200	6053080	No one's gonna...
6053080	6054680	Imagine them going back to town.
6054680	6056120	Oh, they went to Blade Glen.
6056760	6059000	No one's gonna be like, oh, then I'll go there, too.
6059000	6060040	Their town's on fire.
6061720	6064040	The only bad publicity is no publicity.
6064040	6067640	So just keeps our word about us going, travelers.
6067640	6068600	Reputation.
6068600	6069560	Let's just head to...
6071160	6072120	Dumber Fire!
6074440	6075000	I got it.
6075000	6075800	Yeah, that's great.
6076040	6077960	All right, I kind of faked them out.
6077960	6078460	Yeah.
6079240	6080040	Dumber Fire.
6080600	6082360	So now we are on the road.
6082360	6083160	Oh, yeah.
6083160	6083880	Oh, wait, no.
6083880	6085880	Before you get on the road, it's...
6087480	6089400	I guess it's suspicious almost.
6089400	6089960	What is...
6090600	6092840	You get a crow from Game of Thrones.
6093960	6095320	Like a carrier pigeon?
6095320	6095800	Yeah.
6099960	6100600	Oh, boy.
6101880	6103080	It just flies up to us?
6103080	6104200	I thought these were extinct.
6105160	6106520	Can we keep it as a pet?
6109240	6110440	You don't have a cage.
6111880	6113800	I think you're supposed to keep them in circulation
6113800	6115960	so that they are of use to people.
6115960	6116760	Yeah, that's true.
6116760	6118120	That's how they went extinct.
6118120	6119240	Okay, well, then I take...
6122120	6123640	Or maybe we're supposed to keep ones
6123640	6125880	so that we can use it then, or...
6125880	6126840	No, well, I guess it...
6126840	6128120	No, that doesn't make any sense.
6129000	6131800	Well, if you want to buy one, that's like buying a cell phone.
6131800	6132120	All right.
6132200	6136280	I rip off a piece of my map and I curl it around its foot.
6136280	6137960	Oh, wait, I want to write a message.
6137960	6140360	To whoever gets this message.
6141240	6141880	I love you.
6142600	6145880	Exclamation point from diarrhea.
6145880	6149720	And then I tie it around the pigeons or the crow's foot
6150360	6156200	and I go, buy crow and send them back off into the world.
6156200	6156440	All right.
6156440	6158440	Well, do you get the message from the crow?
6158440	6159160	Yeah, it seems like...
6159160	6159880	You took it, right?
6159880	6161080	You took the message.
6161240	6162200	You took the message.
6162200	6165400	It wasn't like offering you the opportunity to send a letter.
6167000	6169480	Also, now, what if we read the message it's from
6169480	6172280	and it's like we intercepted a message from Al-Qaeda
6172280	6173720	and you just sent them like...
6173720	6174200	Right back.
6175960	6177160	You like, Geraldo'd it.
6179320	6181720	I feel like I've got a connection with nature as this beast.
6181720	6182360	All right, well, I still...
6182360	6182920	I call it back.
6182920	6183640	I call it back to take the message.
6183640	6185800	Well, he got the message, didn't you?
6185800	6186280	I heard you said...
6186280	6186680	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6186680	6187720	I pulled the message off for it.
6187720	6188200	Of course, she did.
6188200	6188680	Of course.
6188680	6190360	But that's not the important thing to me.
6190840	6191240	I know.
6191240	6193000	I give the message to Chad.
6193000	6193800	Here's the message.
6195800	6196440	It says...
6196440	6197720	Oh, I love you.
6197720	6198280	Oh.
6198280	6198760	It's from...
6199320	6201160	No, that's the message you put on the text.
6201160	6202680	It's the other message.
6202680	6203640	It says...
6203640	6207480	It's from an old NPC that you guys remember.
6208280	6210120	His name is Brother Absalom.
6210840	6212760	Hope this note finds you well.
6212760	6215000	I'm not in a position to reassign you,
6215000	6217240	but as of now, you're being reassigned.
6217240	6219160	Head to the mining town of Faunchess
6219160	6220680	just south of Blade Glen.
6220680	6222840	There's a dispute between the Miners Bureau
6222840	6225400	and the church's district prelate.
6225400	6226280	Call it a hunch,
6226280	6228520	but from what I've been hearing from your work,
6228520	6231080	you're just the man to blast through this log jam
6231080	6232920	and help Faunchess get back to mining
6232920	6235400	and help the church get back to purifying.
6235400	6237960	When you can, seek a meeting with Zelly and Faunchess.
6237960	6240280	She's in vacation there and will be able to brief you.
6241080	6243240	Burn bright, take flight, Brother Absalom.
6243240	6246360	Okay, but that's written down, so we can reread that.
6246440	6248680	So we can just reread that any time we want.
6248680	6249160	Right?
6249160	6249800	Oh, yeah.
6249800	6252520	How big is this bird that it has a scroll like that attached to?
6252520	6253080	It's a crow.
6254040	6255640	10-foot wingspan.
6255640	6256280	It's a crow.
6257560	6258840	It's a very small writing.
6260280	6261800	I'm not gonna read from a crow, man.
6261800	6262840	I'm gonna take a pigeon word.
6266120	6268200	All right, well, nobody lose that
6268200	6271320	until we get a pen and paper and can write some of it down.
6271320	6272360	I'll hold on to it.
6272360	6272520	Okay.
6272520	6274280	I put it in my pack.
6274280	6274680	Great.
6275240	6276600	It is already written down.
6278360	6278920	It's a mess.
6278920	6282200	I know, but I think it's best for us to have a little redundancy.
6282840	6283800	No, no, I agree.
6283800	6285480	Yeah, we'd photocopy it if we could.
6287080	6288120	That could be something.
6288120	6290680	So it sounds like we're on the way.
6290680	6291720	We gotta choose a path.
6291720	6293560	Do we go to that mining town first,
6293560	6296040	or do we go to Blade Glen to find Patcheons?
6296040	6298680	What would we come across first, the direction we're headed?
6298680	6300120	It's just, it's on the way.
6300840	6302040	That was part of the letter.
6302040	6303640	Yeah, it's just south of.
6303720	6305160	And we're south of that.
6305160	6306120	We're very south of.
6306120	6307080	I'm assuming.
6307080	6308440	We should go to this mining town
6308440	6309720	and see if we can get some gold.
6309720	6311080	Well, it feels like gold.
6313240	6315240	Well, a lot, I heard there's another gold rush.
6315240	6316840	There's another reason to go to the mining town
6316840	6318200	that's not to mine.
6318200	6319560	People need us.
6319560	6321080	There's a civil war happening or something.
6321080	6322520	There's a church involved?
6322520	6324040	There's always a church involved.
6324760	6327880	Let's go to this mining town and steal the gold from the church.
6328440	6328920	All right.
6329240	6334040	Can I reread the part about what's happening in the mining town?
6334040	6336440	Yeah, there's a dispute between the Miners Bureau
6336440	6338360	and the church's district prelate.
6338360	6341240	So remember, you came into the first town you came in
6341240	6344280	because there was some shit going down to the local church.
6344280	6346520	So it's kind of like the church is in a dispute
6346520	6348840	with the Miners Bureau.
6348840	6350280	So it's Miners V Church.
6351720	6352600	That's where we're headed.
6352600	6354600	Man, do you guys remember how crazy that was?
6355480	6357000	Back in, that was a year ago.
6357000	6357480	I don't.
6357480	6358840	No, it wasn't.
6359320	6360520	It was very recently.
6362360	6364200	It feels like a year ago.
6366200	6368280	ID10T Fest, do you remember?
6368280	6369000	It's good times.
6369000	6373320	It was a year to the sadly mistaken gods
6373320	6375720	that believe their lives are more important than ours
6375720	6379800	and who actually just fill time between our adventures
6379800	6381320	as they control the planets.
6382920	6383960	I'm right there with you, bro.
6384120	6384620	Yeah.
6387480	6391480	They would probably look upon us as pieces on a chessboard
6391480	6393880	or characters in some poem.
6393880	6396200	And yet, I'm sure their life is riddled
6396200	6399320	with fucking confusion and inconsistency and alcoholism.
6399320	6400120	Of course.
6400120	6402520	But that's why we belong to the church of the Silver Flame.
6403480	6405880	So we don't have to think about that stuff as much.
6405880	6408760	We have lives of consistency and virtue.
6408760	6411080	And we can tell the good guys from the bad guys.
6411080	6413640	We're not mistaking each other for our fathers
6413960	6415640	and at least we're working at it.
6415640	6416440	Yeah, we're trying.
6417960	6420280	Off to the mining town.
6420280	6421800	For their gold.
6423720	6424920	And to help with the dispute.
6426040	6428920	When we get there, I mean, if I'm moving too fast,
6428920	6429960	I'm going to happen.
6429960	6432360	No, Spencer tells us.
6432360	6434120	So we start.
6434120	6435960	I thought you were going to do Jeff's bit.
6435960	6437560	When we get there, let me do all the talking.
6437560	6438440	Is that what you're going to say?
6438440	6438920	No.
6438920	6439400	Oh, OK.
6439400	6440280	He does.
6440280	6440780	Yeah.
6441420	6444540	That's when he had his vocal cord surgery,
6444540	6448940	the amount of times that was said per week dropped worldwide.
6448940	6449660	20 percent.
6452780	6453900	What were you going to say, though?
6453900	6455580	When we get there, OK, so.
6455580	6456780	Oh, you just wanted to know.
6456780	6457580	Yeah.
6457580	6458460	Oh, man.
6458460	6461180	Getting air is going to be a real hassle.
6461180	6464780	That's several days journey and it might cause monster fights.
6465900	6466460	It doesn't.
6468220	6468620	What?
6468620	6470540	You could tell that in one role.
6470540	6471980	I can for that day.
6473260	6476380	So should we leave it that we're on the road currently on the way?
6476380	6477020	You are.
6477020	6479340	And then you see a mysterious site.
6479340	6482060	A bunch of cultists doing jumping jacks.
6483420	6484220	What?
6484220	6485340	I love jumping jacks.
6485340	6486140	Come on.
6486140	6487500	We practice this in a town.
6487500	6488060	Cultists.
6490060	6490780	What does that mean?
6492220	6493180	Not churchists.
6494220	6496380	I take out my fire sword.
6496380	6496860	What?
6496860	6497340	Whoa.
6497340	6498940	And I kill the leader.
6498940	6499420	What the?
6499900	6500460	Jesus.
6501180	6502060	Cliffhanger.
6502060	6503020	Cliffhanger.
6503020	6503520	OK.
6505020	6505500	All right.
6505500	6505820	That's.
6507900	6509020	We'll see you next week.
