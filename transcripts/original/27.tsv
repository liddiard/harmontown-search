0	7000	This 80's in Nashville, Tennessee.
7000	25000	Oh yeah, oh yeah, I don't care what happens in this show, it's already been the best night
25000	26000	of my life.
26000	27000	You people sat here for a good hour and a half.
28000	31000	Let's thank Jim Little for coming up and playing his heart out for us.
31000	32000	Totally amazing.
34000	36000	I have very good news for each and every one of you.
36000	38000	Harman Town is now in session.
39000	43000	Welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
49000	50000	He's right there.
50000	51000	He's right there.
56000	57000	Keep going the right way.
71000	74000	Music City, USA!
76000	77000	Holy shit.
78000	79000	Wow.
80000	81000	What a magical, magical night.
82000	83000	Or is it just that night?
83000	86000	For my money, I could just walk off stage and go home right now.
87000	89000	Well maybe not for their money.
91000	96000	But it's noteworthy that we, okay, let's go to the timeline.
96000	99000	Because we've been sitting in the back of the room, hanging out with people.
100000	103000	I've been doing countless Jagerbombs with people.
104000	105000	Thank you.
105000	106000	Is it Bob, right?
106000	107000	Bob and Jen, thank you.
109000	110000	I'm not drunk.
113000	119000	It's sleeting and raining and snowing and there's ice daggers falling out of the sky.
120000	121000	And everybody showed up.
121000	123000	The show starts at 7.30.
123000	126000	We're up here at 7.25 on the nugget or something like that.
127000	129000	We've been back there since 6.
130000	133000	I don't know how the timing of it works, but it's like,
133000	135000	oh, get them in here, get them in here.
136000	138000	I don't know why everybody showed up early.
139000	143000	But get them in, get them in, warm them up, light a fire.
145000	147000	But then because we're making this movie,
148000	151000	one of the weird byproducts of making a documentary is,
151000	155000	okay, you can't be playing print songs while everyone's sitting around having a good time.
156000	157000	So yeah, exactly.
157000	161000	It's a shitty corporate, it's one of the many little invisible ways
161000	163000	that corporate America fucks you over.
164000	171000	Like, oh God, Wang Chung can't be playing while I'm waiting an hour for the shit I bought a ticket to.
172000	174000	And so you would be sitting here in abject silence.
175000	179000	But we're in Nashville, Jeff, where music was invented three times over.
181000	182000	The blues was invented here.
183000	184000	Rock and roll was invented here.
185000	188000	And grunge was then invented here.
189000	190000	Is that true?
191000	198000	Yes, it was in this very bar that weezers, their van broke down and they said,
199000	201000	you know what, let's just not get dressed up tonight.
202000	204000	Let's wear a checkered shirt and not wash our hair.
205000	207000	At a club called the ironic old Opry.
209000	211000	Country, western, blues, rock and roll, everything.
212000	218000	Everything that calls itself music purportedly originated from this fertile crescent in the south.
219000	221000	Also, Martin Luther King got shot somewhere in this state.
222000	223000	Don't worry about it.
224000	225000	Not holding you to that.
226000	227000	We're more focused on the Elvis thing.
228000	229000	Love you, love you for it.
230000	231000	No biggie.
232000	233000	It's all about balance.
234000	237000	It's all about perpetuation of cultural infamy.
238000	242000	But only in this state, only in Nashville, only in this city,
243000	246000	could you come in with no music to play when people are sitting and then go,
246000	251000	hey, anybody able to fill an hour with a guitar?
252000	255000	And one guy's like, yeah, I got a guitar in my wallet.
257000	258000	What's his name?
259000	260000	Joe Lill?
261000	262000	Jim Lill.
263000	264000	Joe is a southern for Jim.
266000	271000	Jim Lill, this kid, this little child with his acoustic six stream,
271000	278000	came up here and filled like an hour of time while we did Jagger bombs in the back.
279000	282000	He sang songs that he dedicated to Joseph Campbell.
283000	285000	He sang the community theme at the end.
286000	289000	He strummed and he hummed and he thumped and he bumped,
290000	295000	and he's the John Henry of legally clearable music.
296000	301000	This is the city to be in if you need music.
302000	307000	Also, we've been working on this Harmon Town theme, so we'll probably be bringing people up.
308000	310000	I think there's probably some singers in the audience.
311000	312000	It's Nashville.
313000	314000	Don't shake your head, lady.
318000	319000	I just want to put this out.
320000	325000	I assume there's somebody who can do a mean beat box in the audience.
326000	328000	I expected a bigger reaction than that.
329000	330000	Maybe not. Maybe not.
331000	334000	Maybe Nashville rejects the beat box as a valid musical instrument.
336000	337000	You do?
338000	339000	Oh, I do. Thank you.
340000	341000	What was your name again?
342000	343000	Garrett.
344000	345000	Can you stand up and face everybody?
346000	347000	Is this going to accumulate?
347000	348000	Neil Patrick Harris is...
351000	352000	You probably get that a lot.
353000	355000	Yeah, I'm sorry.
356000	358000	It's nerd on nerd violence.
359000	360000	I shouldn't be doing it.
361000	363000	Who do you get, Dan? Do people say you look like somebody?
364000	365000	Randy Quaid.
366000	367000	I get Randy Quaid.
369000	371000	I want to get Bill Murray so bad.
372000	373000	I just have big people that get,
374000	376000	Bill Murray. Sometimes people say Bill Murray.
377000	378000	No one ever says Bill Murray.
379000	381000	Your neighbor, the lady, the Armenian woman?
382000	383000	She always said I look like Russell Crowe.
385000	386000	I miss that so much.
389000	390000	But she didn't know Russell Crowe's name.
391000	392000	I always have to tell her. She'd be like,
393000	394000	Who do you look like?
395000	397000	He was a gladiator.
398000	399000	Russell Crowe.
400000	401000	No, I don't. Shut up.
403000	405000	Music City, Jeff. Music City.
406000	407000	Couple other nicknames for this town.
408000	409000	The Athens of the South.
410000	412000	A lot of schools, museums, and whatever.
413000	415000	I'm assuming just a lot of columns and things.
416000	417000	I don't know why. Athens of the South.
418000	419000	I don't get it either.
421000	422000	Little Kurdistan.
425000	426000	No one calls it that.
427000	428000	Wikipedia.
429000	430000	Do we have any Kurds in the crowd tonight?
431000	432000	Any Kurds here?
433000	434000	Wikipedia would have you wrong.
436000	440000	Supposedly there's the largest U.S. population of Kurds in Nashville.
441000	442000	Did they just hate me?
445000	446000	I was going to do a whole thing.
449000	452000	I made a bookmark on my phone for Kurdistan.
453000	455000	So I was going to try to riff like a...
456000	457000	Kurds?
458000	460000	A Kurd targeting stand-up act.
463000	464000	You've been to Kurdistan?
465000	466000	Neo Patrick Harris? What's your actual name?
467000	468000	Garrett.
469000	471000	You've been to Kurdistan under what circumstances?
472000	473000	You were in the Army.
474000	475000	What was your MOS?
476000	477000	What the hell does that mean?
478000	479000	A 21 Bravo?
480000	481000	What is that?
482000	484000	What's your MOS? What are you talking about?
485000	486000	What are you guys doing? What's going on here?
487000	489000	Do you ever scream squab a double walnut?
490000	492000	That's not real. That's not real language.
493000	494000	Squeeze a double walnut.
495000	496000	What does that actually mean?
497000	498000	No one seems to know the answer to that.
499000	500000	It's like a military occupational specialty.
501000	502000	Military occupational specialty.
503000	504000	You were a combat engineer.
505000	506000	Does that mean you blew up bridges and stuff like that?
507000	508000	You blew up bridges and you closed it up.
509000	511000	But what did you actually do?
512000	515000	Well, they actually blew up a lot of artillery, though.
516000	518000	That's like blowing up unused artillery and stuff?
519000	520000	Yeah, yeah. It's all over the country.
521000	522000	Were you in Iraq?
522000	523000	Really, how long did you serve?
524000	525000	I was in the three year interaction.
526000	527000	Let's hear your yell.
528000	529000	Ooh!
533000	535000	He had a slightly honorable discharge.
538000	543000	You are amazing out here, but you cannot be relied upon to selling Al Pacino.
544000	548000	And while that does not win or lose wars, we have to let you go.
549000	550000	Yeah, he didn't run.
550000	551000	Imagine.
554000	555000	Whoa is army.
556000	557000	Oh, you're army.
558000	559000	What's your rank? Are you retired?
560000	563000	I was separated.
566000	569000	Why don't you start seeing other branches of the military?
574000	575000	You're just done.
576000	577000	That's a rough gig, man.
578000	579000	You were out in Iraq when things were hairy?
581000	585000	It's like a lot of dull and then a few hairy owls.
586000	588000	It's like incredibly dull, broken up.
589000	592000	Just one of those dull afternoons when you're blowing up artillery and stuff like that.
593000	596000	I saw the Hurt Locker, so I think I know exactly.
597000	599000	I might as well have been there.
600000	605000	I think you're either in a tap or you have to pay a little bit, just about.
607000	608000	It's pretty much.
609000	612000	Yeah, that's what you do.
613000	614000	Take a nice stroll.
615000	616000	What's the worst thing that can happen?
619000	620000	That sounds like such a bummer.
621000	624000	I get like Facebook messages from guys that were like active service out there.
625000	626000	They go like, I love community. I'm out here.
627000	628000	I'm in this station and that station. I'm doing this and that.
629000	632000	And I write back to them and go like, you fucking stay safe.
633000	634000	Just stay safe. Just get back home.
635000	637000	And I don't know if that's the right response because they never write back.
639000	643000	I don't know if it's because they're like, well, don't be an asshole.
644000	646000	Tell me who I am. I don't know.
647000	649000	Get back here, you fucker.
651000	652000	My ratings are so low.
655000	656000	They go, what are you doing out there?
658000	659000	You watch my show?
660000	662000	We need consolidation of the forces.
663000	666000	That's the limit that you support the troops is to the extent that they have a Nielsen box.
667000	668000	What are you doing?
669000	672000	Nashville, Jeff named for Francis Nash.
673000	674000	You know who Francis Nash is.
675000	677000	Yeah, I know. But but today he invented.
678000	679000	He invented the typewriter.
680000	681000	No, he didn't.
682000	685000	I couldn't figure out Francis Nash. Is there any Francis Nash experts in the audience?
686000	689000	Because I got the blank says it's the city's named.
690000	693000	There's a lot of things in the south named after Francis Nash.
694000	695000	He was kind of a weird character.
696000	697000	I didn't really get to get a line on it.
698000	701000	I Wikipedia Nashville and I said and then I was like, who's this Francis Nash guy?
702000	703000	He's a good guy or a bad guy.
704000	705000	And I couldn't really figure it out.
706000	707000	So I was wondering if there's anybody here.
708000	710000	I hate to interrupt this trenchant commentary on Nashville.
711000	714000	But is there an audience member wearing one of our GoPro cameras on his head down in the front?
717000	718000	Yes, there is.
719000	720000	Love it.
721000	723000	So our asshole director just came and put a camera on your head.
724000	725000	He didn't even ask.
726000	727000	He didn't even ask.
728000	731000	We're going to get lots of awesome shots of Dan's balls during this.
732000	734000	In addition to the ball cam.
739000	741000	The city sometimes called the buckle of the Bible Belt.
743000	745000	I would figure my audience wouldn't approve of that.
746000	748000	But I think that's that's mythologically important.
749000	751000	But they have but they have the power to unbuckle it.
751000	752000	Yeah, exactly.
754000	755000	Don't don't don't deny that power.
756000	757000	All you have to do is go.
758000	760000	And then the South's pants fall down.
761000	763000	The whole country changes.
765000	766000	But you can't deny the fact.
767000	775000	I think honestly we were in Atlanta and I really went to town on you know how politically or historically like like important it was that we were in Atlanta.
776000	777000	I was supercharged there.
778000	779000	Here it gets it could get a little uncomfortable talking about that.
779000	787000	But like like Nashville what eclipses it is that throughout the decades no matter what comes along musically like like Nashville just like what is it.
788000	789000	What is it Jeff.
790000	791000	Why do they love music so much.
792000	793000	I love country music.
794000	795000	I like old country music.
796000	797000	Yeah.
798000	800000	Like I don't really like the new what they call it the Nashville sound right.
801000	802000	Like it's too overproduced for me.
803000	804000	It's just too.
805000	808000	As Waylon Jennings called it because it's flat belly country like a country musician should have a pop belly.
809000	812000	He doesn't like any any guy that seems country has abs.
814000	816000	I think that's a good barometer to go by.
817000	822000	I mean I think this is this is where Garth Brooks invented the typewriter the wire work right.
823000	827000	If I were to float above the audience I remember having a big fight with my mom about Garth Brooks.
828000	829000	And it's not important.
830000	831000	It sounds pretty important.
832000	841000	I guess my mom when I was growing up she loved country music and then I was I was like oh that Garth Brooks he knows where it's at because he flies over the audience on a wire.
842000	853000	And my mom was like that you know he's an asshole and I was like fuck you because I was really offended because I was starting to get into country music for because Garth Brooks flew over.
854000	855000	That's why I said I didn't want to talk about it.
856000	857000	I'm just going to.
858000	860000	I thought you would not be on the Garth Brooks side.
861000	865000	I was trying to I mean here I'm on the arguing with my mom side like no matter what.
866000	869000	I'm 40 years old I'll still like I'll have any excuse to fight with my mom.
870000	871000	I was just like Garth Brooks he's cool.
872000	873000	Just I thought it would make her like me.
874000	876000	And then she's like Garth Brooks.
877000	879000	And I was like I can't do anything right.
880000	881000	It doesn't matter.
882000	887000	I want to go because I've never been really I've been through Nashville but tonight we actually you know the show's kind of early.
887000	893000	We get to go out and I've been told like I need to go out and hang out like on Broadway and go to some honky tonk bars like that's what I want to do.
894000	895000	No huh.
896000	897000	A coyote ugly.
897000	898000	Okay I take it back.
898000	899000	I take it back.
900000	904000	I went to a coyote ugly Dan on Thanksgiving a few years ago in New York and not on purpose.
905000	915000	I was with a friend and it was Thanksgiving night and I was with my friend Vanessa and we were walking around like the Lower East Side East Village and we're trying to find a bar to go into on Thanksgiving.
915000	925000	And I was really overdressed and so was she went to a fancy restaurant and we're just trying to find a nice bar to drink in but everything was either closed or you walked in and it was so depressing because it was Thanksgiving.
926000	933000	And it's just people like this was crying into their beers or there are bars where people are really trying to pretend that they weren't sad that they weren't with their families.
934000	938000	And it was really overcompensating and it was just too much douchebaggery for one bar to contain.
939000	940000	And so I said it was freezing.
941000	942000	I know the snow is falling.
942000	948000	And we're like look whatever the next bar is good bad or indifferent we're going into that bar and we see a sign up ahead and we could see some neon.
949000	954000	Okay that's we're going to that bar and a block away she stops me she goes Jeff Jeff Jeff no no no no no no no no.
955000	959000	I'm like no we said we made a deal we're going into that bar and she goes that bar is coyote ugly.
961000	962000	I'm like fuck it.
962000	963000	We're going in.
963000	965000	So we go into the coyote coyote ugly.
966000	974000	There's nobody there except three Korean gentlemen who are really really trying to just dig it like trying to like you know they're hitting numbers at random on the jukebox.
975000	977000	Like a George Strait song that George Strait doesn't like comes on.
979000	980000	He's ill fated.
981000	982000	I stubbed in my toe.
983000	992000	So I go to the bar and now when someone plays the songs that they are required by law these two poor women that are kind of sexy have to get up on the bar and join the bar.
993000	999000	Playlessly dance around for you and it's really like don't do this for me like whatever they're paying you I'll double it.
1000000	1009000	And I had this really nice tie on this Vivian Westwood tie and this woman this young girl who's the bartender I found that she's from Colombia and she was just hot as a Colombian lunch.
1010000	1030000	So very sexy and she jumps up on the bar pours a shot pours Cuervo tequila into her mouth grabs me and squats down from on top of the bar grabs my head and spits a mouthful of Cuervo into my mouth and I was like swallow the barf.
1031000	1042000	And then she takes some scissors out and grabs my brand new Vivian Westwood tie and starts to come at my tie and I grab her hand like like like Robert De Niro in awakening.
1047000	1052000	And I can't she's like you can't wear a fucking tie in here you cannot wear a fucking tie.
1052000	1067000	And it was that it was that offensive an impression that she was doing of her homeland and I grabbed her and I thought on my feet and I said well my father gave me this in his death bed.
1068000	1073000	My dad's not dead. My dad is not dead. I bought that tie and she's like okay and she's like well take it off and put it in your pocket.
1073000	1079000	Because the corporation that owns this bug told me I have to cut it off and hang it in the water that's a gimmick.
1079000	1085000	There are cameras everywhere my family is in the back duct tape defaulting chairs you have no idea how important this is to me.
1085000	1092000	Wasn't there a TV show called Coyote Ugly? Isn't there a good sign that Piper Caraboo whatever her name was was another thing.
1092000	1095000	Jeff I just noticed these people while you were telling that story.
1095000	1100000	Yeah she got she got she got all the drink orders wrong and it was the worst but then we ended up having fun because it was so bizarre.
1101000	1103000	I'm doing the rest of the show this direction.
1108000	1112000	I don't know what you guys paid but this doesn't seem fair.
1114000	1116000	What have we done so far that you didn't want.
1123000	1124000	There's a civil war.
1125000	1135000	My podium is awesomely made of plexiglass so it's perfect crotch action if you were ladies.
1135000	1138000	This episode of Harmontown is brought to you by Fulton and Roark.
1138000	1143000	Jeff you're sick of spilling all your colognes all over the place you hate liquid colognes is that correct.
1143000	1148000	It's my nemesis. It's the thing that gives me nightmare dreams all night long.
1148000	1153000	I can't remember how many times I've walked in on you just just covered in sticky wet cologne.
1153000	1161000	I have traveled and broken a bottle of the cologne that I wear and then my luggage smells like a French whorehouse for the rest of time.
1161000	1171000	Yeah but Fulton and Roark is a men's fragrance and grooming company that specializes in solid colognes shave and shower products all designed to make getting ready easier and more enjoyable.

1176000	1180000	You know I do mean that but I also mean physically solid as well.
1180000	1191000	Oh like a little like you're talking about a wax based cologne that travels in a little small package that I can't spill all over my luggage and smell like a Mexican tit house.
1191000	1194000	So these are travel friendly wax based colognes that can go anywhere.
1194000	1198000	Plus there's nothing to break or spill and of course they all smell fantastic.
1198000	1199000	Fantastic.

1297000	1298000	Yeah.
1298000	1299000	Name Josh.
1300000	1302000	He brought moonshine with him.
1304000	1310000	And I've never had moonshine and I thought he could come up and give me a taste of moonshine on stage.
1310000	1311000	That sounds awesomely illegal.
1311000	1313000	Let's bring him up. Josh everybody.
1316000	1320000	It's one of the many many hilarious gimmicks we can do here.
1322000	1331000	OK so a guy is coming up right now who looks like Dan Harmon's younger brother and he has a brown paper bag that goes on his days.
1331000	1332000	Josh.
1333000	1334000	I create something real quick.
1334000	1336000	I'm not an authentic Nashvillian.
1336000	1337000	I'm from Knoxville.
1337000	1338000	But.
1342000	1345000	I'm representing the hill people who make the moonshine.
1345000	1347000	So comes in a jar.
1348000	1349000	You have to drink it out of the jar.
1349000	1350000	All right.
1350000	1351000	I'm drinking another jar.
1352000	1353000	But this is this is label.
1353000	1354000	This is like this is.
1355000	1357000	I don't have a direct connection to the hill people.
1357000	1359000	So I had to I had to do what I could.
1359000	1360000	Are you a hill person.
1362000	1363000	But I feel like I can represent them.
1363000	1364000	That's good.
1364000	1365000	I appreciate that.
1365000	1367000	OK. The mason jar is being cracked open.
1368000	1369000	Or potentially.
1370000	1371000	Can we get a lady up to loosen this for him.
1371000	1372000	There we are. We got it.
1373000	1374000	Let's go to the brim.
1376000	1377000	You know we learned a little bit of.
1380000	1381000	Do I drink the whole jar.
1382000	1383000	No no no no.
1384000	1385000	No you.
1385000	1387000	That'll be a very different time.
1400000	1403000	Well I'm proud to be from Nashville.
1404000	1406000	And the birth of the music scene.
1407000	1409000	I'm drinking white light and thunder.
1410000	1412000	And you know my mother knows what you mean.
1413000	1415000	I got a eldest on the left side.
1416000	1418000	Got some Beatles on the right.
1419000	1423000	I'm going to go and do a southern thing tonight.
1424000	1427000	I got a moonshine and a wickwam wiggy.
1428000	1433000	I'm Dan Hyman doing the southern thing.
1441000	1442000	Oh shit.
1443000	1444000	That tastes like.
1445000	1446000	What does it taste like.
1446000	1447000	That tastes like.
1449000	1451000	It's probably what I'm doing.
1452000	1453000	No you know what it tastes like.
1454000	1455000	It tastes like grappa.
1455000	1457000	I think that's like Italian moonshine.
1457000	1458000	It's really nice.
1459000	1460000	It's hill grappa.
1461000	1463000	It tastes like a fight with my girlfriend.
1465000	1468000	It tastes like tonight Aaron and I are going to have a fight.
1469000	1472000	No you could probably run your car on this.
1473000	1474000	What is the proof on this thing you know.
1476000	1477000	40 50 percent.
1478000	1479000	100 proof.
1479000	1480000	Yeah I mean.
1480000	1481000	Why is there a barcode.
1482000	1483000	It's called Old Smokey.
1483000	1485000	Old Smokey Tennessee moonshine.
1486000	1487000	It's quite good.
1487000	1488000	From Gatlinburg Tennessee.
1489000	1490000	I love it.
1491000	1492000	It's good.
1492000	1494000	The second sip tastes better than the third.
1494000	1495000	Yeah.
1497000	1499000	And then time folded in on itself.
1500000	1501000	Oh boy.
1503000	1504000	Okay.
1504000	1506000	Well you drink it from a jar and yeah.
1508000	1509000	Thank you Josh.
1510000	1511000	Nashville.
1513000	1514000	This is the best.
1515000	1524000	I think all shows should start with us at the bar with the crowd with a local busker up here laying down the jams and then and a dude comes up and just gives us booze.
1525000	1526000	I don't know if they'd agree.
1526000	1535000	I mean I we were thinking back there like let's start the show just earlier but then like we didn't know if anyone was going to show up at the appropriate time.
1536000	1538000	Then they'd come in and we'd be doing like a raffle.
1539000	1542000	I feel like we should get Jim Lillip here at some point and have a guitar maybe.
1543000	1544000	No you should.
1544000	1545000	Here's what I want to do in Nashville.
1545000	1550000	Like if we do nothing else because it's Music City USA I'm sorry I'm going to be burping.
1551000	1552000	Are you okay.
1552000	1553000	Moonshine.
1553000	1556000	You know a comic died here in 1983 the year it opened.
1556000	1557000	I was talking to the owner.
1557000	1558000	It was not moonshine related.
1558000	1560000	That was 1983 related.
1561000	1563000	Guess guess what he was on.
1565000	1567000	It was probably a lot of things.
1569000	1578000	But yeah we went to we definitely got to get to do the guitar up and we were going to get some some Rihanna's and some titles up here.
1580000	1588000	Tennessee last state to leave the union when the Civil War conflict happened or I'm sorry aggression of the north.
1588000	1589000	What do you call it.
1589000	1593000	The war of northern aggressive the war of the north being an asshole.
1595000	1597000	First state to be readmitted.
1597000	1598000	I think that's very interesting.
1599000	1602000	Tennessee last one out last first one back in.
1603000	1606000	Just a just a quick like fuck it fuck it.
1608000	1609000	I think that's very interesting.
1609000	1611000	Which way is the wind blowing north.
1611000	1612000	I support that.
1613000	1615000	I think that makes this state like my.
1616000	1617000	We were in Georgia.
1617000	1618000	It was like holy shit.
1618000	1619000	These guys like they got the brunt of it.
1619000	1622000	But I like the idea of a state that was like is there a war.
1622000	1623000	Is there a war.
1623000	1624000	Okay.
1628000	1630000	Not like the French in World War Two.
1630000	1631000	Not like your pussies.
1632000	1634000	But more like you're practical.
1634000	1636000	Like what the fuck was that war about.
1636000	1637000	We don't even know.
1637000	1638000	Still trying to figure it out.
1641000	1644000	I'm pouring myself a moonshine rocks.
1644000	1654000	I can tell you a little I don't know if this will be entertaining to people because I'm three sips of moonshine in.
1657000	1658000	Thank you Mandy.
1661000	1666000	We at the at the at the hotel on the elevator the elevator opened up and there was a guy.
1667000	1668000	He worked for the hotel.
1668000	1670000	He was going down.
1670000	1674000	We he didn't need to get off on the floor that we were getting off on.
1674000	1677000	But he had a big luggage rack full of paint supplies and shit.
1678000	1682000	And we Aaron and I were going down.
1683000	1685000	We were trying to squeeze in and he's like you know what.
1685000	1686000	Let me get off.
1686000	1688000	And so you guys can get on.
1688000	1689000	I'll take the next elevator.
1690000	1698000	The elevator door closed and Aaron and our elevator and Aaron Aaron referencing the guy that just did that went huh.
1699000	1702000	That's what they call a Nashville style.
1703000	1706000	And I said I think you mean Southern hospitality.
1707000	1710000	And she said no no it's Nashville style.
1711000	1712000	I knew it wasn't funny.
1713000	1716000	I thought it was really funny because I was I was thinking my head.
1716000	1719000	That's a southern has but Nashville style.
1719000	1720000	She made up a new thing.
1721000	1723000	Sorry. Is there a Nashville style.
1723000	1724000	I don't know if there's somebody out there.
1724000	1725000	I'm sure there is.
1725000	1727000	I'm sure it has nothing to do with the elevators.
1728000	1729000	Yes.
1729000	1730000	We've gone to so far.
1730000	1731000	Well Phoenix.
1731000	1732000	No one's proud of being from Phoenix.
1732000	1733000	I'll erase that one.
1733000	1738000	But Atlanta and Austin that we've been to people very very proud of being from those cities.
1738000	1739000	I take it.
1739000	1741000	You guys are all pretty proud of being from Nashville too.
1741000	1742000	Right.
1743000	1744000	No.
1744000	1745000	OK.
1745000	1746000	I take it back.

1747000	1748000	There's always going to be Jeff.
1748000	1756000	There's always going to be a swirl of like weird reactions to that shit like because people have like this need to go like fuck the.

1770000	1772000	They cry out for individuality.
1774000	1776000	Mandy cries out for moonshine.
1778000	1781000	You and I are not going to go into a single town where we go.
1781000	1784000	Hey Nashville you love tires.
1784000	1785000	Right.
1785000	1786000	And everyone goes like we love tires.
1787000	1790000	There's always somebody who's going to go like we don't love tires that much.
1790000	1791000	Fuck you.
1791000	1792000	Like we're human beings.

1880000	1882000	I think there's like a B flat in there somewhere.
1883000	1884000	It's like it's like.
1885000	1886000	So I go.
1888000	1889000	I go.
1890000	1892000	Some people call me Pringles dick.
1892000	1894000	But I never really found out why.
1895000	1897000	I don't really have a Pringles dick.
1897000	1899000	I just keep my dick inside.
1901000	1906000	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
1907000	1911000	Some people call me Pringles dick but I never really found out.
1911000	1913000	No I never found out.
1913000	1915000	I never really found out why.
1917000	1918000	I think I got that.
1919000	1920000	I think I got that.
1920000	1921000	What tempo should we do it in there?
1921000	1922000	How should we do it?
1922000	1924000	Do you want to keep it sad or should we make it move a little bit?
1924000	1925000	Let's make this sucker move.
1925000	1927000	Let's do this in a Nashville style.
1928000	1929000	It's a thing.
1929000	1930000	It's a thing now.
1930000	1931000	Nashville style.
1939000	1944000	Oh some people call me Pringles dick but I never really found out why.
1945000	1947000	I don't really have a Pringles dick.
1947000	1949000	I just keep my dick inside.
1951000	1955000	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
1957000	1960000	Some people call me Pringles dick but I never really found out.
1960000	1962000	No I never found out.
1962000	1964000	I never really found out why.
1964000	1966000	Yo, yo, yo.
1966000	1968000	Potato chips on my dick.
1968000	1970000	I want to put my dick inside a stick.
1970000	1972000	Got a can on my hand.
1972000	1973000	Don't want to do it.
1973000	1976000	I thought I'd do a rat bridge but I'm doing badly.
1976000	1979000	Oh deep deep deep Samaduna.
1979000	1982000	Oh making mouth noises and strutting.
1982000	1984000	Sorry sorry I didn't mean to interrupt.
1984000	1985000	Sorry.
1985000	1988000	I got cocky because you guys were having fun.
1988000	1990000	It seemed like you guys were having fun.
1990000	1994000	Some people call me Pringles dick but I never really found out why.
1994000	1995000	I won't do it again.
1995000	1997000	I don't really have a Pringles dick.
1997000	1999000	I just keep my dick inside.
1999000	2000000	So sorry about what I did.
2000000	2005000	Keep my dick inside a Pringles can because it keeps my penis safe and dry.
2005000	2006000	Yeah yeah.
2006000	2010000	Some people call me Pringles dick but I never really found out.
2010000	2013000	No I never really found out why.
2013000	2015000	Oh no.
2015000	2018000	Oh sorry.
2018000	2021000	Sorry.
2021000	2022000	Sorry.
2022000	2023000	Stay up here Jim.
2023000	2024000	Park it.
2024000	2025000	Will you stay here?
2025000	2027000	Yeah make yourself comfortable.
2027000	2033000	Because we already, we've got this theme song developing.
2033000	2039000	Is it time to bring up like we bring up some female vocalists.
2039000	2041000	Do we have any more microphones back there?
2041000	2042000	We have Spencer's mic.
2042000	2045000	Do we have 50 more microphones?
2045000	2046000	Behind the camera.
2046000	2047000	I was introduced.
2047000	2050000	A girl came up and she said her friend wants to sing.
2050000	2054000	Is Ashley out there right now?
2054000	2056000	Ashley to the stage.
2056000	2057000	You've been outed by your friend.
2057000	2058000	Was it Melissa?
2058000	2059000	Yeah.
2059000	2065000	Melissa has, she volunteered you.
2065000	2066000	All right.
2066000	2068000	Ashley everybody.
2068000	2070000	Here's your microphone.
2070000	2072000	Hello.
2072000	2073000	Ashley have you heard the song?
2073000	2075000	Have you been following the podcast?
2075000	2079000	Is this the penis one?
2079000	2081000	Probably.
2081000	2083000	What podcast have you been listening to?
2083000	2085000	If you have a penis song.
2085000	2086000	No, no.
2086000	2087000	If you mean Pringles Dick then no.
2087000	2089000	Our song about Harmontown and pee and poo.
2089000	2090000	Have you heard that song?
2090000	2092000	No but I will collaborate.
2092000	2093000	All right.
2093000	2094000	So here we go.
2094000	2097000	We'll play it so we can get you up to speed.
2097000	2098000	Give you a little primer.
2098000	2106000	You can't just say syllables.
2106000	2107000	Yeah.
2107000	2110000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2110000	2113000	Turn your frown upside down.
2113000	2116000	Pee is yellow poop is brown.
2116000	2119000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2119000	2122000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2122000	2125000	Turn your frown upside down.
2125000	2128000	Pee is yellow poop is brown.
2128000	2130000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2130000	2131000	Take it fast.
2131000	2134000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2134000	2140000	My poop is brown.
2140000	2142000	Overqualified.
2142000	2144000	Overqualified.
2144000	2147000	Shit.
2147000	2149000	Make up your own words.
2149000	2150000	We're getting tired.
2150000	2152000	We've become tired of our own words to that.
2152000	2154000	So if you want to just freestyle, here we go.
2154000	2155000	Turn.
2155000	2158000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2158000	2162000	Take it to your frown upside down.
2162000	2164000	Sorry.
2164000	2166000	That's all right.
2166000	2167000	You guys write the joke.
2167000	2168000	I'll just sing harmony.
2168000	2174000	So Jim, it's E minor, C, G, D, or anything else.
2174000	2176000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2176000	2179000	Turn that frown upside down.
2179000	2182000	Pee is yellow poop is brown.
2182000	2184000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2184000	2186000	You guys are some of the best songwriters.
2186000	2188000	I've heard it in Nashville.
2188000	2190000	I've done myself on this one.
2190000	2192000	I won an Emmy for it.
2192000	2194000	I'm leaving.
2194000	2197000	I don't agree.
2197000	2200000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2200000	2203000	Turn that frown upside down.
2203000	2206000	Pee is yellow poop is brown.
2206000	2209000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2209000	2212000	Salt shakers on the table.
2212000	2213000	I hope I'm rapping.
2213000	2215000	I hope I'm able.
2215000	2218000	I'm in a club called Sadie's in Nashville.
2218000	2221000	I hope I give you the whole ticket price bill.
2221000	2224000	I hope I'm able to give you everything.
2224000	2227000	She's doing it at the same time as I'm rapping.
2227000	2228000	It's so confusing.
2228000	2230000	It's so weird.
2230000	2232000	It's happening at the same time.
2232000	2234000	My beard is...
2234000	2235000	Come on down to Harmontown.
2235000	2236000	What's happening?
2236000	2239000	Everything's static.
2239000	2241000	It's weird.
2241000	2243000	Okay, all right.
2243000	2245000	I'm going to hang back.
2245000	2246000	All right.
2246000	2248000	Okay.
2248000	2249000	All right.
2249000	2251000	Okay.
2251000	2253000	Bravo.
2253000	2257000	Ashley, we open in three nights.
2257000	2259000	All right.
2259000	2261000	And there's not a single person in Nashville
2261000	2263000	that can do percussion.
2263000	2264000	Oh, Josh.
2264000	2266000	Wow.
2266000	2271000	Josh purveyor of corn squeezings and percussion.
2271000	2272000	Dan, are you okay?
2272000	2273000	Yeah, I'm fine.
2273000	2275000	You're hanging by a thread over there.
2275000	2277000	I've never seen you like this, man.
2277000	2280000	Just give me one more sip of the...
2280000	2282000	I'm fine.
2282000	2285000	Now, Ashley and Jim and Josh, we're going to send you back.
2285000	2287000	We're going to bring you back up later on for the...
2287000	2288000	For the finale.
2288000	2289000	Yeah, for the reprise.
2289000	2290000	All right, we'll start practicing.
2290000	2291000	All right, go. Yeah.
2291000	2293000	Yeah, going back and, like,
2293000	2295000	make the G chord match to the C chord.
2295000	2297000	No, that's Nashville.
2297000	2299000	No, that's exactly how it works.
2299000	2300000	No.
2300000	2301000	Absolutely.
2301000	2306000	Hey, Josh, Jim, Tracy, Morgan.
2306000	2307000	Yeah.
2307000	2309000	Tracy Morgan was right there?
2310000	2312000	All right, I suppose now is the time to bring up
2312000	2314000	our Dungeon Master, Spencer Crittenden.
2314000	2315000	Can we bring him up?
2319000	2323000	Oh, shit!
2328000	2330000	Oh, shit!
2331000	2333000	Oh, shit!
2333000	2340000	That's... that's accurate.
2340000	2342000	Nashville!
2349000	2350000	Thank God.
2350000	2351000	How you doing, Spencer?
2351000	2352000	We're starting to keep you waiting so long, man.
2352000	2353000	What's up?
2353000	2354000	Oh, no, it's all good.
2354000	2356000	I was just in the back there.
2359000	2362000	Sharpening your dice or...
2362000	2364000	You soak them in alcohol.
2364000	2365000	Is that true?
2365000	2369000	Yeah, it appeases the gods of luck.
2369000	2371000	Well, I've been soaking myself in alcohol,
2371000	2373000	and I'm very appeased.
2373000	2376000	Well, I can't roll you too easily, but let's see.
2376000	2377000	Do you want some moonshine?
2377000	2379000	Do you drink?
2379000	2380000	This is bad, bad.
2380000	2381000	Spencer, have some moonshine.
2381000	2383000	You can't have two.
2383000	2384000	We're in Nashville.
2384000	2389000	Spencer on the road, he's a huge fan of Mountain Dew.
2389000	2392000	Mountain Dew is originally a slang term for a moonshine.
2392000	2393000	Yeah.
2393000	2395000	Because they made it by the moonlight.
2395000	2398000	I don't know what to do with the thing.
2398000	2401000	So, this is some real Mountain Dew.
2401000	2403000	If I vomit, you guys, don't hold it against me.
2403000	2405000	I never will.
2406000	2408000	I'll slather myself in it.
2410000	2412000	My lips are numb.
2414000	2416000	He announced it.
2417000	2418000	This is a tour of firsts.
2418000	2420000	We certainly have the first comedy tour, I think,
2420000	2423000	to travel on a tour bus with our own Dungeon Master.
2425000	2428000	Almost certainly, we're the first show to have a Dungeon Master drink moonshine
2428000	2430000	before mastering a dungeon.
2430000	2433000	So, this is probably the last.
2433000	2436000	All right, do you want to dispense our character sheets there?
2436000	2438000	Yeah, we're going to need Aaron up here then.
2438000	2441000	Let's bring up Aaron McGathey.
2441000	2444000	Aaron McGathey, Dan's girlfriend, Maureen Sedano.
2444000	2446000	Aaron, everyone.
2451000	2454000	I love your Nashville style.
2456000	2459000	How would you define Nashville style, Aaron?
2460000	2462000	Kindness from strangers.
2462000	2468000	It's kind of hospitality in a, not North region, but like below it.
2468000	2469000	Nashville style.
2469000	2471000	Can I get some of that moonshine?
2471000	2473000	Yeah, absolutely.
2473000	2476000	I want to commit to this fight that we're having later.
2477000	2479000	What should we fight about?
2479000	2481000	I feel like I drink a tree.
2482000	2484000	It just feels like drinking a tree.
2484000	2485000	It's really good.
2485000	2486000	It's so good.
2486000	2489000	You know, drinking too much makes Spencer sick.
2489000	2491000	Yeah, that's why I said the vomit thing.
2491000	2494000	I just want to be cool, you guys.
2494000	2497000	Spencer, you're in safe surroundings.
2497000	2499000	We'll take very good care of you.
2499000	2502000	Unless that guy poisoned everyone.
2504000	2507000	Oh, I think it tastes fine. It's like water.
2507000	2509000	Oh, it tastes like water.
2509000	2511000	No, it doesn't.
2513000	2515000	I always drink my water from under the sink.
2515000	2516000	That's where I find my water.
2516000	2518000	Who's got the lid?
2518000	2519000	I got it.
2519000	2520000	Can I?
2520000	2521000	Yeah.
2521000	2522000	Take some of the acid down.
2522000	2524000	We're all going to fuck tonight, you guys.
2525000	2528000	Spencer, if you would, get us up to date.
2529000	2534000	Last time, Sharpie and Quark parted ways with Mulrain, the half-elf.
2534000	2537000	The Ranger had some business to attend to elsewhere,
2537000	2540000	with arrows and possibly magic belts to locate.
2540000	2543000	The duo pressed onwards, hoping to arrive in time
2543000	2547000	to assist Mango against the threat of Admiral Darkstar's Dark Armada.
2547000	2549000	Arriving at the scene of a great battle,
2549000	2552000	the heroes watched in horror as legions of cylindrical constructs
2552000	2555000	pushed back the Barbarian Horde.
2555000	2558000	The cylinders seemed to be pressing towards a great excavation site,
2558000	2561000	a huge pit in the ground near the yellow camp.
2561000	2563000	In a moment of clarity, or madness,
2563000	2567000	Sharpie leapt into action and hurled Quark at one of the floating cylinders.
2567000	2569000	Clinging on for dear life,
2569000	2573000	Quark could only watch in confusion as a swarm of cylinders descended into the pit,
2573000	2576000	retrieving a massive golem.
2576000	2579000	A flying ship reeled it in and then flew away,
2579000	2583000	with Quark in tow, the cylindrical army retreated to the ship.
2583000	2587000	The ship sailed north, the group was split.
2587000	2591000	That's right. I don't know if you heard that podcast.
2591000	2597000	Yeah, so I've reluctantly clung on to a flying cylinder
2597000	2599000	and boarded a giant spaceship,
2599000	2602000	which is presumably Admiral Darkstar's mother's ship, right?
2602000	2604000	Perhaps, right?
2604000	2608000	So I'm separated from Sharpie and Mulrain for the first time.
2608000	2612000	I should mention that your healing pendant has brought you back to full health.
2612000	2614000	So I'm back to 40 hit points?
2614000	2616000	Yeah.
2616000	2618000	40 hit points, motherfucker.
2618000	2620000	Oh!
2624000	2626000	40 hit points.
2626000	2628000	No, no, no.
2628000	2630000	I'm sorry, it's the moon shine.
2630000	2632000	I'm sorry.
2632000	2634000	Oh, boy.
2634000	2636000	I love hit points.
2636000	2638000	Okay, sorry.
2638000	2640000	Do I go first or what?
2641000	2643000	I'll decide to go first.
2643000	2645000	Alright.
2645000	2647000	I examine my new strange surroundings.
2671000	2673000	Aww.
2678000	2681000	So are there any doors in the room I'm in?
2687000	2689000	I climb the ladder.
2695000	2698000	I use all my barbarian strength to open the hatch.
2700000	2702000	No, it just opens.
2702000	2704000	Yeah, okay.
2704000	2706000	Better safe than sorry.
2706000	2708000	As you poke your head through the hatch,
2708000	2710000	you can see the slithering yellow demons
2710000	2712000	that you fought before.
2712000	2715000	They wail painful wails as they move about.
2715000	2717000	They take no notice of you.
2717000	2720000	Metal pipes, tubes, and gauges are lining the walls of the chamber.
2720000	2723000	You can see three doors left, right, and center.
2723000	2725000	Are those doors labeled in any way?
2725000	2727000	Left, right, and center.
2731000	2733000	That's good thinking.
2735000	2737000	Can I make it to a door undetected?
2737000	2739000	You can certainly try.
2739000	2742000	I use my gnome ability to sneak,
2742000	2746000	and I sneak towards the first door, the left door.
2746000	2748000	Alright, do you have any rings that move silently?
2748000	2749000	Don't I?
2749000	2751000	Probably not, but...
2751000	2753000	I thought I was good at sneaking about.
2753000	2754000	Uh, maybe.
2754000	2756000	I have fast movement. I use my fast movement.
2756000	2757000	Alright.
2758000	2761000	Moving swiftly, you cross the floor.
2761000	2763000	You make it towards the... what door? The center door?
2763000	2764000	Left door.
2764000	2765000	Left door.
2765000	2767000	This door is locked.
2767000	2769000	There's strange script written on the door.
2769000	2771000	You don't understand the language.
2771000	2773000	I go to the center door.
2774000	2777000	You approach the center door.
2777000	2779000	You hear the sound of large explosions
2779000	2781000	coming from the other side of the door.
2783000	2784000	Nice.
2784000	2785000	I open the door.
2785000	2786000	I open the door.
2786000	2790000	You open the door, and what you see is so...
2790000	2792000	We cut to another character.
2793000	2796000	Okay, alright. Yeah, act break.
2796000	2798000	Gold Bond Powder.
2800000	2802000	Sharpie, you're standing out front of Yellow Camp.
2802000	2804000	Corpses and destroyed machines litter the ground.
2804000	2807000	The remaining barbarians are hauling their own into the Great Tent.
2807000	2809000	The gnolls are also gathered around their dead,
2809000	2811000	but rather than burying or hauling the corpses,
2811000	2814000	the gnolls strip their breath and then consume the fallen.
2814000	2816000	Cannibalism is never glamorous.
2816000	2819000	You can see your father standing at the entrance of the Great Tent.
2819000	2821000	He's surveying the work being done.
2821000	2824000	From the east, you can see a horse and rider fast approaching.
2826000	2827000	Dad.
2829000	2830000	Yes.
2830000	2831000	I mean, yes.
2831000	2833000	Come clean with me, what the hell's going on?
2833000	2836000	Who's this... who's this Admiral Darkstar?
2836000	2837000	I don't know.
2837000	2839000	They just came down in those ships.
2839000	2841000	Did you see that shit? That was crazy.
2842000	2844000	The sky opened up.
2845000	2849000	But, okay, I got some bad news to tell you.
2850000	2853000	You know how I said I had like a couple shards?
2853000	2854000	Yeah.
2854000	2855000	They're gone.
2856000	2859000	I still have yet to poop out that other one, but...
2860000	2861000	Wait, what do you mean?
2861000	2863000	I think they've been stolen.
2864000	2865000	Dad.
2866000	2868000	You know what?
2868000	2872000	I grew up my whole life thinking that you thought I was a piece of shit.
2872000	2875000	I come back, turns out you're a piece of shit.
2876000	2878000	Well, that's the barbarian way.
2879000	2881000	Well, he does a little dance.
2881000	2882000	What was that?
2882000	2884000	That's the barbarian way.
2885000	2886000	It's like Nashville style.
2886000	2887000	Nashville style.
2888000	2889000	Nashville style.
2889000	2890000	Whoa, wait.
2890000	2891000	Whoa, wait.
2892000	2894000	Okay, lame. Yeah, lame.
2894000	2895000	Fine.
2895000	2897000	I accept that I'm lame.
2897000	2899000	Where did your friend go?
2900000	2908000	I hoisted him onto a cylinder, and he's now in the mothership of these things that you're fighting with that you don't know anything about.
2908000	2910000	And I'm a piece of shit?
2912000	2915000	I just... Are you gonna go after him?
2916000	2917000	I'd like to.
2918000	2921000	Okay. Well, can you fly?
2922000	2923000	You're a wizard, right?
2924000	2925000	A lizard?
2926000	2927000	A wizard?
2927000	2929000	I'm sorry, dad. I've had a lot to drink.
2929000	2930000	I can't enunciate.
2931000	2936000	Yes, I'm a wizard. I don't... No, I can't... Dad, I can't fly.
2936000	2939000	I can feather fall when you throw me out a window.
2939000	2944000	I can abate a physical feeling when you hit me with a belt.
2945000	2951000	I can create a bubble around myself emotionally when you make me feel like a piece of shit.
2952000	2955000	That's not even magic. That's just... That's just therapy.
2957000	2959000	What is... What is therapy?
2960000	2961000	Dad.
2962000	2963000	I love you.
2964000	2967000	I hug him. I give him a plus one hug.
2969000	2970000	Only one?
2970000	2971000	Yeah.
2972000	2973000	Hug successful.
2975000	2977000	You seem to have broken through.
2977000	2981000	Dad, don't you get it? Power doesn't have a definition.
2982000	2986000	Some of us are magicians. Some of us are barbarians. Power is power.
2986000	2990000	Like, there's nothing more important than the bond between father and son.
2990000	2995000	Like, you're a barbarian. I'm a magic user. That's the way it goes.
2995000	2997000	The important thing is our name.
2997000	3000000	Like, we gotta bring these fucking ships down.
3000000	3003000	My friend is up on one of them.
3004000	3005000	What are you doing?
3005000	3006000	Logging in my iPad.
3007000	3010000	You've touched him. Your words have touched him.
3011000	3013000	The hug was touching.
3015000	3016000	Touching occurs.
3017000	3021000	Says, you're right, you know, you are my son and you're greater at magic than I will ever be.
3022000	3024000	So now it's time for you to have this.
3024000	3028000	He takes the multicolored cloak off his shoulders and bestows it upon you.
3028000	3035000	He says, this cloak is made from the very canvas that forms these great tents and is infused with great magic.
3036000	3039000	It can give you the power of limited teleportation.
3049000	3054000	Limited teleportation is my power. I got it by minute by minute, hour by hour.
3054000	3057000	I got a cloak from my dad and now I can go places.
3057000	3061000	Whoa, yeah, all races. Oh, shit.
3061000	3063000	All right. Sorry.
3063000	3065000	Little dance break.
3067000	3069000	Are we all races?
3069000	3072000	Mulrain, you're among the trees in a small grove.
3072000	3073000	I.
3073000	3080000	Few venture to this grove as knowledge of the magical forest died along with your five children in the massive blaze that consumed your home.
3081000	3084000	Yes, I remember. I think about it every day.
3084000	3089000	You hear the winning and neighing of a struggling horse, not far off, breaking your meditation.
3090000	3094000	Oh, is there an animal in pain?
3094000	3096000	I rushed to the animal.
3096000	3098000	Winnie, nay.
3098000	3105000	You see a horse tied to a tree and a woman sitting on the ground propped up against a tree upon closer inspection.
3105000	3107000	You realize the woman is dead.
3107000	3110000	Her throat is slit and a dagger is sitting on the ground nearby.
3110000	3112000	There's a piece of parchment on the paper.
3114000	3115000	It's a harsh world.
3115000	3117000	There's monsters and spaceships.
3117000	3119000	And I'm dealing with a mutilated woman.
3119000	3120000	Fine.
3120000	3121000	It's important.
3122000	3126000	Dear woman, I. Oh, oh, oh.
3126000	3127000	Oh.
3129000	3130000	I must.
3130000	3131000	I must bury you.
3131000	3134000	I must show you the honor that my children were not shown.
3136000	3137000	I.
3137000	3138000	She doesn't respond.
3139000	3140000	No.
3140000	3141000	No, you must be awake.
3141000	3143000	Please wake up, please.
3143000	3150000	I slap her face in the sad way when someone does a movie based on a Michael Crichton film.
3150000	3151000	I keep on.
3155000	3156000	Yep.
3157000	3160000	I try to untie the horse.
3160000	3162000	You untie the horse.
3162000	3165000	It stands and regards you.
3167000	3170000	Dear horse, I regard you as well.
3171000	3173000	I nuzzle the horse.
3174000	3175000	The horse is nuzzled.
3177000	3180000	It seems as if it wants to say something.
3181000	3183000	No, not like that.
3187000	3188000	You have wild empathy.
3188000	3190000	You can empathize with the horse.
3190000	3191000	It seems to say.
3192000	3194000	I use my wild empathy.
3194000	3197000	You can you can ride on me.
3200000	3203000	Horses aren't very eloquent.
3204000	3208000	Dear horse, I hear your message and I shall do your bidding.
3208000	3210000	I will ride you.
3211000	3212000	All right.
3213000	3215000	The horse is just standing there now.
3215000	3216000	The horse is standing there.
3216000	3217000	OK.
3217000	3221000	I leap upon the horse and I'm really cute when I do it.
3222000	3224000	Leaping upon the saddle.
3224000	3227000	You notice a bit of paper sticking outside the saddle.
3227000	3229000	I ignore the paper.
3229000	3230000	You know.
3230000	3232000	I pick up the paper.
3232000	3233000	I always ignore the paper.
3233000	3234000	Fuck it.
3234000	3235000	I read the paper.
3235000	3236000	Probably nothing.
3236000	3237000	Never read the paper.
3237000	3238000	Probably nothing.
3238000	3241000	To whoever reads this, know that I was a man.
3241000	3243000	Known for my comically oversized pants,
3243000	3245000	I was always tripping over my own legs.
3245000	3247000	In search of a belt, I finally found one
3247000	3249000	after slaying a group of orcs.
3249000	3251000	When I put it on, I realized that I'd become a woman.
3251000	3253000	So I killed myself.
3253000	3254000	Have a nice day.
3254000	3255000	Don't wear this belt.
3255000	3257000	Unless you're into that sort of thing.
3258000	3260000	Signed, baggy pants-o hoolahan.
3265000	3267000	It's a note from Sinbag.
3267000	3269000	Oh my.
3269000	3271000	I'm excited.
3271000	3272000	I start to cry a little bit.
3272000	3273000	I do a little dance.
3273000	3274000	I find the belt.
3274000	3276000	The belt's around the dead woman, right?
3276000	3277000	Yes.
3277000	3278000	I grab the belt.
3278000	3279000	That happens.
3281000	3283000	I put the belt on.
3283000	3285000	You put on the belt.
3285000	3286000	You're transformed into a man.
3286000	3287000	A woman.
3287000	3288000	Woman, man.
3288000	3289000	Woman.
3298000	3299000	I'm back.
3299000	3303000	I shake out my long, long hair.
3303000	3306000	And I puff my breasts.
3306000	3307000	That's a thing, right?
3311000	3313000	Are you looking to see if puffing your breasts is a thing?
3313000	3314000	Critically puffed.
3317000	3319000	I must find Sharpie.
3319000	3322000	But first, I fashion a dress out of leaves.
3323000	3324000	That happens.
3326000	3329000	And I get on the horse, and I start heading towards Sharpie.
3329000	3330000	Okay.
3330000	3332000	Cut back to Quark.
3334000	3335000	Which store were you going for again?
3335000	3338000	I was going to the door with explosions going on behind me.
3338000	3340000	Senator, you opened the door.
3340000	3342000	The room is long, running the length of the ship.
3342000	3345000	Several cannons are lined up, aimed outside of the ship.
3345000	3348000	A few of those yellow demons, as well as one black creature,
3348000	3350000	are roaming up and down the aisle.
3350000	3352000	Occasionally, one slithers up to a cannon,
3352000	3355000	adjusts it, and fires it off with a loud explosion.
3355000	3357000	They don't regard you.
3357000	3360000	Are these the Harpoon cannons, or just regular cannons?
3360000	3361000	These are regular cannons.
3361000	3362000	Regular cannons.
3364000	3366000	Is there anything beyond the...
3366000	3368000	Is there a door beyond those people?
3368000	3369000	There's no door.
3369000	3371000	It just leads back to the main room.
3372000	3374000	I intimidate them.
3374000	3376000	You intimidate...
3376000	3378000	There's two different kinds of monsters.
3378000	3380000	I intimidate...
3380000	3383000	Who's more threatening, the slamming guys or the black dude?
3385000	3386000	I didn't mean it like that.
3388000	3391000	I'd say the black creature is a bit more threatening.
3391000	3392000	Yeah, you would.
3393000	3395000	A little typical.
3396000	3398000	I try to intimidate the black guy.
3402000	3405000	What's your intimidate bonus?
3405000	3407000	My intimidate...
3407000	3409000	Where the hell...
3409000	3410000	Nine.
3410000	3411000	You intimidate him.
3411000	3413000	He doesn't seem to speak the same language as you,
3413000	3414000	but he cowers in fear.
3414000	3416000	He starts hissing.
3418000	3419000	Power attack.
3422000	3423000	One, two, three.
3423000	3425000	What's the difference?
3425000	3426000	I would say four.
3426000	3428000	The higher the number, the less accurate, but the more damage.
3428000	3429000	Okay, two.
3429000	3430000	Two.
3430000	3431000	Yeah.
3431000	3432000	Oh, critical hit.
3432000	3433000	Fuck yeah.
3438000	3439000	You all ready for this?
3440000	3443000	You slice the monster in half and it burns into pieces.
3444000	3446000	Alright, what do the slamming guys do?
3446000	3450000	They look at you before continuing on.
3450000	3453000	I run past them to the opposite end of the corridor.
3453000	3454000	That happens.
3454000	3456000	I look for a door to move through it.
3456000	3459000	There's no other doors, just the one that leads back to where you came.
3459000	3460000	Hmm.
3460000	3461000	Say what?
3461000	3462000	Berserker...
3462000	3464000	She wants me to go into Berserker Rage.
3464000	3465000	I don't even know...
3465000	3467000	Is there any use for me to use these cannons?
3467000	3470000	I mean, if you want to, like, shoot things, maybe?
3470000	3471000	Like, on the ground.
3471000	3472000	Say what?
3473000	3474000	Attack the slugs?
3474000	3477000	They're not doing me any dirt?
3478000	3479000	Yeah.
3479000	3483000	Okay, so I use flaming sword on one of the slamming guys.
3483000	3484000	Yeah!
3484000	3485000	You miss.
3485000	3486000	Shit.
3487000	3488000	Now what?
3488000	3490000	The slug turns and faces you.
3490000	3492000	It quickly slithers to a button and hits it.
3492000	3493000	Uh-oh.
3493000	3494000	You hear a siren.
3495000	3496000	Cut to...
3498000	3499000	Dan.
3499000	3500000	Oh, yeah.
3500000	3501000	You're back with your father.
3501000	3502000	You're having a tender moment.
3502000	3503000	Right.
3503000	3505000	The horse and rider approaches.
3506000	3508000	He gave me his curtain, right?
3508000	3510000	Yeah, he has your cloak.
3510000	3511000	It rides up.
3511000	3513000	It's a half elf female.
3514000	3515000	Yay!
3516000	3517000	Hi.
3517000	3518000	Hi.
3518000	3519000	Mulvane.
3520000	3521000	You're a woman.
3521000	3522000	Yes.
3523000	3524000	I am.
3524000	3529000	I shake out my hair and it's like sparkles and stars fall from my hair.
3531000	3535000	I have my dad's cloak now.
3536000	3542000	This is a relationship born in a horrible self-interest.
3544000	3545000	I don't...
3545000	3547000	I don't understand what you mean.
3547000	3548000	Well, I...
3548000	3553000	You know, I can provide for you now because I can teleport and now you have a vagina.
3555000	3556000	I feel like we've been...
3556000	3558000	I always had a mind vagina.
3561000	3567000	On my way over here, I realized that you should have fallen in love with me as a person.
3567000	3570000	And not as a beautiful woman that I am.
3570000	3574000	So perhaps for a little while, we should just be companions.
3575000	3576000	I...
3576000	3577000	What?
3577000	3578000	Dungeon snap.
3579000	3580000	Dungeon snap.
3582000	3584000	I haven't a side with the horse.
3584000	3586000	The horse looks at you.
3587000	3588000	Horse, I...
3588000	3590000	I love him so much.
3590000	3592000	I just want to know that it's real.
3595000	3596000	I'm just a horse.
3597000	3600000	And that's why I love you too, horse.
3600000	3602000	That's why I love you too.
3602000	3604000	I love... hey.
3605000	3606000	Oh, horse.
3606000	3607000	I turn back.
3607000	3609000	Hey, listen.
3609000	3615000	I don't know what I did wrong before you were a chick, but I think you're really attractive now.
3616000	3618000	My friend is on a spaceship.
3618000	3620000	Yes, and let's help him.
3620000	3622000	He's always been there for me.
3622000	3625000	Yes, let's go rescue him.
3627000	3629000	No, please, let's rescue him.
3629000	3630000	Yes.
3631000	3633000	No, let's rescue him.
3633000	3634000	Let's, please.
3634000	3635000	It's all I'll be there.
3635000	3636000	Dad.
3636000	3637000	Dad.
3637000	3638000	Hey, hey, what?
3638000	3645000	Is there any way I can use your coat of teleportation to teleport up to the spaceships that...
3645000	3646000	Well, you...
3646000	3647000	Can I grab your moonshine?
3647000	3649000	Can I take your moonshine?
3650000	3652000	You're hitting that pretty hard, man.
3652000	3654000	This jar is like half empty.
3654000	3659000	Can I grab your... can I grab your smart juice from you?
3660000	3661000	Thanks.
3661000	3669000	You can teleport to anything you see, maybe, or like there's a couple places you could just go to without seeing.
3669000	3671000	You got to finesse it.
3672000	3673000	Not good with the magic.
3673000	3675000	Do I see the dark stars, starships?
3675000	3676000	You can see it on the horizon.
3676000	3677000	All right.
3677000	3678000	It's very far away.
3678000	3681000	I use my cloak to try to teleport to them.
3681000	3683000	Can you... I jump inside the cloak.
3683000	3686000	In a whirling flourish, you teleport.
3686000	3688000	You find yourself in a metal room.
3688000	3690000	Cannons light the room.
3690000	3692000	A barbarian gnome stands before you.
3692000	3693000	Hey!
3693000	3694000	I did it.
3694000	3695000	Sharpie!
3695000	3696000	Sharpie!
3696000	3698000	I killed burning myself to a certain death.
3698000	3699000	Am I there?
3699000	3700000	I'm still here.
3700000	3701000	You're there.
3701000	3702000	Okay.
3702000	3703000	You're all there.
3704000	3705000	Sharpie!
3705000	3706000	Sharpie!
3706000	3707000	Are you there?
3707000	3708000	Bow rain!
3708000	3710000	It's me, and now I'm a lovely lady.
3710000	3712000	Wow, that changes everything.
3713000	3714000	Nice leave dress.
3715000	3716000	Thank you.
3716000	3717000	I fashioned it.
3718000	3721000	Meanwhile, there's a slimy guy who's firing cannons over here.
3721000	3722000	A little help?
3722000	3725000	I take two arrows.
3728000	3730000	I fire the arrows at the slimy guys.
3732000	3733000	Do you have your sheet?
3733000	3734000	What's your attack bonus?
3734000	3736000	It's like a thousand.
3737000	3738000	It's like a thousand.
3738000	3740000	You hit with both arrows.
3740000	3741000	Woo-hoo!
3741000	3742000	Really?
3742000	3743000	Yeah.
3745000	3747000	Guys, I hit with two arrows.
3750000	3752000	Your arrows strike the remaining demon in the eyes.
3752000	3753000	It falls dead.
3753000	3755000	I just helped you.
3755000	3756000	A thousand.
3756000	3757000	Bonus.
3757000	3758000	Well, he knew I was kidding.
3758000	3759000	He adjusted it.
3759000	3760000	I read it on her sheet.
3762000	3763000	It's plus three.
3763000	3765000	Alright, we should probably stop there, right?
3765000	3766000	Cliffhanger!
3766000	3767000	Yeah.
3767000	3768000	Cliffhanger!
3773000	3776000	Can I get a little sheets?
3777000	3778000	You okay, Dan?
3778000	3779000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3779000	3783000	You seem like you're kind of just descending into some sort of weird madness.
3785000	3790000	I may be slowly going blind, as they say.
3791000	3792000	It's Nashville.
3792000	3793000	Can I leave yet?
3793000	3794000	That was awesome.
3794000	3800000	The reason why rock and roll and blues and grunge, I think, were invented here is because
3800000	3802000	there's no wrong answers.
3803000	3806000	And so we have to finish up the show with...
3808000	3809000	No, I'm sorry.
3809000	3811000	No, we could be here forever.
3812000	3813000	We have to...
3813000	3815000	Holy shit, that moonshine fucked me up bad.
3815000	3816000	I'm so sorry.
3816000	3819000	If you want your money back, I'm in back.
3819000	3825000	I think as direct as you might be right now, I think now is the time to test your rapping abilities,
3825000	3826000	because throughout...
3827000	3829000	Can we do one thing first?
3829000	3831000	The camera crew had...
3831000	3834000	Can we outfit me with the Jacques Cousteau?
3834000	3836000	I want to work the crowd.
3836000	3837000	Okay.
3837000	3840000	Can we get Dan the chest GoPro camera?
3841000	3842000	We had this thing...
3842000	3843000	Ryan from our crew.
3843000	3844000	Everybody is coming up.
3844000	3845000	He's going to outfit.
3850000	3851000	I've been working the crowd lately.
3851000	3853000	I think we have to...
3853000	3857000	Dan's worried about his rapping abilities, and they're not getting any stronger for some reason.
3858000	3861000	You'd think that as much as Dan raps about fucking people's mamas,
3861000	3863000	that there would be some notable improvements,
3863000	3868000	but I think maybe you can harness as you're being harnessed, literally.
3873000	3874000	Okay.
3874000	3875000	You can harness...
3875000	3877000	I want to come out there and work the crowd.
3877000	3878000	All right.
3878000	3879000	Are you going to be rapping?
3879000	3880000	You want to beat?
3880000	3881000	No, no, no.
3884000	3885000	This isn't about rapping.
3885000	3887000	This is about personal relationships.
3887000	3889000	I want to know who's out there.
3891000	3892000	Working the crowd.
3892000	3893000	Yeah.
3893000	3894000	Working the crowd.
3894000	3895000	Thank you, sir.
3895000	3896000	All right.
3896000	3897000	Here we go!
3899000	3900000	Go work stage right.
3900000	3901000	They've been neglected tonight.
3901000	3903000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3905000	3908000	This is going to be a fucking fiasco.
3908000	3909000	I know it.
3913000	3914000	All right.
3914000	3915000	Okay, first.
3915000	3916000	What's your name?
3916000	3917000	Zach.
3917000	3918000	Nice try.
3920000	3921000	That's how you work the crowd.
3921000	3924000	You ask people shit, and then you make fun of them.
3925000	3926000	What's your name, ma'am?
3926000	3927000	Tanika.
3927000	3929000	How do you know when you're finished?
3929000	3930000	No!
3930000	3931000	All right.
3931000	3932000	Sorry.
3932000	3933000	I'm going to get personal.
3933000	3934000	He's so drunk.
3937000	3938000	What was your name?
3938000	3939000	Tanika.
3939000	3940000	Tanika.
3940000	3943000	More like fun-e-ga.
3944000	3946000	Are you from Nashville?
3946000	3947000	No.
3947000	3948000	Good.
3948000	3949000	Me neither.
3952000	3954000	What are you doing here?
3954000	3955000	Acting.
3955000	3956000	What for?
3957000	3958000	For fun?
3958000	3959000	Why?
3959000	3960000	Because?
3960000	3961000	What do you mean?
3962000	3965000	Working the crowd!
3966000	3967000	Yeah!
3967000	3968000	Tanika!
3971000	3972000	What's your name?
3972000	3973000	Sarah.
3973000	3974000	Sarah.
3975000	3976000	What are you...
3976000	3979000	Why sit here?
3979000	3981000	Just seat in the house.
3981000	3983000	Just seat in the house?
3983000	3984000	More like a...
3984000	3987000	Where's the seat in the apartment?
3989000	3990000	Take it easy.
3991000	3994000	If you could have anything you wanted, what would you have?
3994000	3995000	What would you have?
3997000	3998000	Sorry.
3998000	3999000	Sorry.
3999000	4000000	That was...
4000000	4001000	All right.
4001000	4002000	Jeff.
4002000	4003000	Give me a second.
4003000	4004000	Okay.
4004000	4005000	What was your name?
4005000	4006000	Sarah.
4006000	4007000	Sarah.
4007000	4008000	We got Sarah back here, Jeff.
4008000	4009000	Right?
4009000	4010000	Yeah.
4010000	4011000	Jeff.
4011000	4012000	Sarah.
4012000	4014000	What's your favorite car?
4016000	4018000	I heard Ferrari.
4020000	4021000	Whoo!
4021000	4022000	Ferrari!
4023000	4024000	Okay.
4024000	4026000	Jeff, this isn't working out so good.
4026000	4027000	Working the crowd.
4027000	4029000	Are you going to sing an R&B song to her right now?
4029000	4030000	No, no.
4030000	4031000	Let me try it.
4031000	4032000	All right.
4032000	4033000	What's your name, sir?
4033000	4034000	Sing a sexy R&B song, Dan.
4034000	4035000	What's your name, sir?
4035000	4036000	Andrew.
4036000	4037000	Andrew?
4037000	4040000	What's the name of the girl that broke your heart the most?
4041000	4042000	Oh, shit.
4043000	4044000	Viv.
4044000	4045000	Viv?
4046000	4047000	Shit.
4047000	4048000	Yeah.
4051000	4052000	You playing it?
4052000	4053000	You playing the song?
4053000	4054000	I'll give you a rap beat.
4054000	4055000	How about that?
4055000	4056000	Yeah.
4056000	4057000	What was your name again, sir?
4057000	4058000	Andrew.
4058000	4059000	Yeah.
4059000	4062000	I think, Dan, that Andrew got his heart broke by Viv.
4062000	4064000	Would you fuck his mama?
4064000	4066000	I don't think so.
4066000	4070000	I think tonight's about reaching out to him.
4075000	4076000	All right.
4076000	4077000	Don't keep working the crowd.
4077000	4078000	I'm sorry.
4078000	4079000	What's your name?
4079000	4080000	Hailey.
4080000	4081000	Hailey?
4081000	4082000	How do you know when you're finished?
4082000	4083000	All right.
4084000	4085000	Just, yeah.
4086000	4089000	Dan, it seems like you're afraid of human connection right now.
4089000	4090000	What's your name?
4090000	4091000	Matt.
4091000	4092000	Matt?
4092000	4093000	I don't think so.
4095000	4096000	Working the crowd.
4096000	4098000	Working the crowd.
4099000	4102000	You're glossing over real humanity out there, Dan.
4102000	4103000	What's your name?
4103000	4104000	Jonathan.
4104000	4105000	I don't think so.
4106000	4107000	All right.
4110000	4111000	Working the crowd.
4111000	4112000	All right.
4112000	4113000	Hold on a second.
4119000	4120000	Yeah, that'll be fine.
4120000	4121000	That'll be fine.
4121000	4122000	Don't worry about it.
4122000	4125000	I'm going deeper than anyone's ever worked, any crowd.
4125000	4128000	I'm going back to the people that have never ever worked.
4128000	4132000	These guys never thought they'd be talked to, did you?
4132000	4134000	What's your name?
4134000	4135000	Matt?
4135000	4136000	Matt?
4136000	4137000	What do you do?
4138000	4139000	For a living.
4139000	4141000	How do you know when you're finished?
4141000	4142000	All right.
4142000	4144000	Jim Lill back at the stage and Ashley.
4144000	4145000	Who is it?
4145000	4146000	Ashley.
4146000	4148000	Yeah, Ashley, get back up here and Josh on percussion.
4148000	4150000	Let's get the band back together.
4151000	4153000	You can share a stool.
4154000	4155000	All right.
4156000	4158000	I apologize, everybody, honestly.
4159000	4164000	All your money will be sitting in a pile by the exit.
4164000	4168000	You can just take whatever you thought tonight cost you.
4168000	4171000	Some of you drove here six hours.
4171000	4174000	Just take $600.
4174000	4176000	I will support you.
4177000	4178000	That's all I want.
4178000	4180000	Dan, why are you so down on your sloth right now?
4180000	4183000	It's almost like you drank like four ounces of...
4183000	4185000	Of some sort of high-octane...
4185000	4186000	Of wood alcohol?
4186000	4188000	High-octane, depressant.
4191000	4194000	What's the chord progression of the Harman-Johnson?
4194000	4199000	E minor, C, G, D.
4201000	4206000	If you're going to join us in Charlotte, learn this, and bring it.
4217000	4220000	Such an honor to be with good people.
4220000	4223000	From church to church, steeple to steeple.
4223000	4226000	I saw your mama sucked her titties.
4226000	4229000	I've never been in such a good city.
4229000	4233000	Nashville got horrible racisms.
4233000	4234000	It doesn't matter.
4234000	4238000	There's no schism between you and between me.
4238000	4242000	Let's go south and let's go...
4242000	4244000	Come on, guys.
4245000	4248000	Come on down to haunted town.
4248000	4251000	Turn that frown upside down.
4251000	4254000	He is yellow, poop is brown.
4254000	4257000	Come on down to haunted town.
4257000	4260000	I'm too drunk, took too much moonshine.
4260000	4264000	I'm sorry I didn't drink more white wine.
4264000	4267000	I just wish I could hang out and talk to you.
4267000	4270000	I'm so sorry my set turned to pee and poo.
4270000	4272000	I didn't mean to disappoint you.
4272000	4276000	Twenty-two dollars is what you spent.
4276000	4279000	I let you down.
4279000	4281000	Pull it.
4281000	4284000	Okay, all right, fine.
4284000	4287000	Yellow poop is brown.
4287000	4290000	Come on down to haunted town.
4290000	4294000	Self-ridicule at the end of the station.
4294000	4296000	I can't take it no more.
4296000	4299000	I feel like a bad person.
4299000	4301000	Oh, shit.
4301000	4304000	It's terrible watching this happen.
4309000	4312000	Don't clap. Don't laugh. Don't clap.
4312000	4315000	You're just looking at a guy that's a cloud.
4315000	4317000	He's traveling across the country.
4317000	4323000	He's got shit to write, but instead he's going around and doing this.
4323000	4325000	It's a terrible thing to do.
4325000	4328000	I'm so sorry that I made a friend of you.
4328000	4331000	You guys were very fine in the back,
4331000	4333000	and you bought me Jagerbombs,
4333000	4336000	and now I gave you a price attack.
4336000	4340000	That means... what does it mean?
4340000	4342000	I can't...
4342000	4345000	Come on down to haunted town.
4345000	4347000	Say a frown upside down.
4347000	4349000	Shame.
4349000	4351000	He is no wonder it's round.
4351000	4354000	Come on down to haunted town.
4354000	4357000	I'm going to flow. I'm going to rap good.
4357000	4361000	I'm going to make corn squeezes out of termite wood.
4361000	4364000	I'm going to drink a mason jar of lightning.
4364000	4367000	I'm trying to rap and I want to start fighting it.
4367000	4370000	I'm going to have a couple fuckers on guitar.
4370000	4374000	I want to fuck your mama so hard she plays guitar.
4374000	4377000	I'm going to fuck her all the way to India.
4377000	4379000	I fucked your mama.
4379000	4381000	I fucked your mama.
4381000	4383000	God damn it.
4383000	4386000	I can't let Nashville end like this.
4386000	4389000	I'm going to do goodbye. I'm the invented Elvis.
4389000	4392000	I'm going to fuck your mama so hard I split her pelvis.
4392000	4395000	I'm going to fuck your mama. They invented blues.
4395000	4399000	I'm going to fuck your mama. She can't win. She lose.
4399000	4402000	Come on down to haunted town.
4402000	4403000	Yeah.
4403000	4405000	Come on down upside down.
4405000	4409000	Bitch, they ain't never running around.
4409000	4412000	Come on down to haunted town.
4412000	4415000	Come on down to haunted town.
4415000	4418000	I see a double brown upside down.
4418000	4419000	Yeah.
4419000	4420000	He is yellow.
4420000	4421000	He says brown.
4421000	4422000	Yeah.
4422000	4426000	Come on down to haunted town.
4426000	4428000	Come on down to haunted town.
4428000	4431000	Burn that brown upside down.
4431000	4433000	I want to thank Jim Lill, everybody.
4433000	4434000	Keep it.
4434000	4435000	Jim Lill.
4435000	4437000	Ashley.
4437000	4439000	Josh in the moonshine.
4439000	4441000	Aaron McGaffey.
4441000	4444000	Spencer Crittenden.
4445000	4447000	I'm Jeff Davis.
4447000	4450000	This is Dan Harmon.
