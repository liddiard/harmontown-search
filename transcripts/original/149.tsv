0	7000	Welcome the mayor of Ryman County, Mr. Dan Hartman.
30000	48000	Thank you. Thank you, Portland. Wow, it's cavernous. This is cavernous. It's good, though.
48000	54000	Dan, could I ask you a personal question?
54000	61000	Yeah. Have you been drinking today? A little bit.
61000	66000	All right, so I just want to get through the Evernote list.
66000	81000	So a guy I met at a bar today, it was his 25th birthday, and I bought him a drink, and he was turning 25,
81000	88000	so I said, man, you've got to do all your shit, 25. I'm 42. It's a bunch of stuff.
88000	95000	Every day, I think I say, well, if I was 25, I'd do this or that. So you've got to do everything.
95000	102000	And he said, yeah. It's like, yeah, you've got to go inner tubing with sluts.
102000	110000	That's what he said, and I wrote it down. He said, I fucked that up. He said, inner tubing with hot sluts.
110000	117000	So he distinguishes those ugly sluts that you don't want to go inner tubing with.
117000	127000	I thought Portland might enjoy that. Do people still inner tube here? Do you guys go on the hot sluts?
127000	134000	Does that make it better? What's the river here? Is it the Deschutes, right? You got the Deschutes here?
134000	136000	Is it the Cooch, the Cooch River?
136000	139000	Willamette.
139000	146000	But you guys have hot sluts here, but they're not more important than the regular sluts, are they?
146000	153000	And they're not better at inner tubing. Right? I don't know. Ask that kid.
153000	155000	Hot sluts.
155000	158000	Hot sluts. Inner tubing with hot sluts.
158000	162000	All right. The last thing on my list.
162000	169000	The last thing on my two-item list is, well, I mean, there's another, there's a side note, which is a Twitter corner.
169000	181000	Does Twitter corner have a theme? Twitter corner.
181000	188000	If you have something to say to me, and you can fit it in a tweet, say it.
188000	194000	If it takes nine tweets, say it somewhere else. That's it. That's it.
199000	201000	I thought that may resonate.
201000	208000	No one wants that in their feed, like the guy with the parentheses, the eight out of nine guy.
208000	212000	And first of all, feminism in the early nineties.
212000	218000	Buddy, it's Twitter. It's a bumper sticker. Just say you like women.
218000	226000	You don't have to say it nine times. Or write a blog. No one will read it. That's the point.
226000	232000	I mean, just don't. I'm blocking everyone now. I block, I block, I block.
232000	234000	How many a day? How many blocks?
234000	241000	I block more people than healthy people eat kale. I block, I block, I get up in the morning and I block.
241000	246000	I start blocking. I just block. That's the end of that corner.
248000	254000	All right. So a guy at the bar across the street. What was it? The queen moon in six pence? What's that place called?
254000	256000	The moon in six pence or something?
256000	261000	There was a guy. So obviously, because I'm doing a show here, some of you were drinking there tonight.
261000	266000	And a lot of you came up to me and were very friendly to me and told me that you like me.
266000	270000	And it was very wonderful. And I enjoy it. And I love your city. And I love you.
270000	277000	There was a guy sitting next to me at the bar who like three hours ago, obviously I've been drinking for six hours.
277000	288000	And the guy the entire time was like, he was just this guy. And he kept going like, what do you do?
288000	293000	And it's like, I do a podcast. That's why they're saying these nice things to me.
293000	302000	What's a podcast? Well, it's a thing. And I have to explain it. And he's like, so it's like radio?
302000	310000	No, it's not. I mean, yes, it's like radio. Fine. Done. Forget it. Just all you have to do is stop talking to me and your troubles will be over.
310000	318000	You don't have to. And he's like, so why are you famous, though? And I'm like, I'm not famous. I'm not there.
318000	324000	You're experiencing people coming up to me in this bar two blocks from the venue. They are excited to see the show.
324000	331000	They're getting a drink before they go and line up. I'm not famous. I'm as famous as you are, kind of like if you like,
331000	338000	wherever you work, if a lot of people worked there and you were going to do karaoke, like that's what's happening.
339000	345000	Well, what's your name? My name is Dan Harmon. Why do you spell it? It's fucking God damn it. What the fuck?
345000	351000	I'm not allowed to do this to other people. H-A-R-M-O-N. Well, I'm going to ask my son.
351000	359000	My son's in college. Would my son hear of you? I said, I bet your fucking ass he has, motherfucker.
359000	365000	That's how good I am at karaoke. Your son. Yeah, I crossed the line there. I was like, I bet your son has.
365000	372000	But then it was three hours later, the guy's like, well, I asked my son and he said, I googled him and I had never heard of him.
372000	381000	Fuck you. I don't know why I'm telling this story, but I was like, I never knew I wanted to be famous until I talked to this guy.
381000	389000	It wasn't even a thing in my mind. I didn't want the guy wants to be clearly he wants to be famous or his son does. I don't know.
390000	400000	I'm just saying. Like, I was fine until I talked to that guy. I found the first dickhead in Portland is my story.
400000	406000	I love Portland. So fun here. We have to fly out. Fuck Portland.
406000	418000	Fuck this city. Let's burn this shit hole down. Fuck Portland. Let's all not get face tattoos.
418000	427000	A lot of face tattoos here. Hey, hey, Portland. You guys have all seen human centipede three, right?
427000	434000	I did. I watched it. Wait, there's a three. Yeah, there's three. What happens in three in the third one?
434000	443000	This is this was on my list of shit to talk about. Yeah, there's okay. So human centipede three.
443000	454000	The how many people have seen human centipede one? I got some 15 percent of the people here. Yeah, that was the eight eight percent.
454000	463000	People have seen human centipede one and two. Just as a side note, how many people have seen human centipede two but not human centipede one?
463000	470000	Just jump to the middle of the saga. Okay, no hands, no hands. So clearly there's a linear appeal. It's like Game of Thrones.
470000	478000	Number two really is the Empire Strikes Back of it all. You don't want to you don't just jump in the middle. Okay, we know that that's important for the research.
478000	484000	Human centipede three. Anybody see it? Okay, a couple. One hand, one hand.
484000	502000	The guy from the first movie, the guy from the first movie is the is a prison warden in the third movie and every movie every movie adds more people like there's three people in the first one.
502000	516000	There's like 24 people I think in the second one and then this one's like a prison. It's like 500 people. So the guy from the first movie is the is a warden.
516000	523000	He's a prison warden, Jeff. And, and he doesn't he doesn't know how to run his prison.
523000	531000	So what does he do? Does he, does he try to seek some solution to his personal problems?
531000	538000	He has this accountant who's like keeps telling him like you I'm telling you and he keeps the accountant keeps showing him.
538000	542000	We're feeding them too much and there's too much poop.
542000	544000	He keeps showing him the first two humans.
544000	548000	Cut down on the food and the poop waste.
548000	560000	The five people who raised their hands know that the human centipede saga has a weird meta like thing going through it where in each movie each movie is about someone who's watched the previous movie.
560000	572000	So the third movie is about a prison warden who is being told by his accountant who has seen both of the previous movies that this is the way to go with the.
572000	577000	And the prison warden is played by the by the same guy that played the doctor in the first movie.
577000	586000	The guy who's like yes poop your diarrhea in the mouth behind you. Yes, I am a doctor.
586000	600000	I love watching people poop into each other. That guy's a Texas warden in the third movie and his accountant says and I wrote it down.
600000	605000	This is the defining moment forty five forty five minutes into human centipede three.
605000	623000	This is after the we've watched the doctor try to castrate people and like like he tries everything he can think of to be a good warden and the and the accountant keeps going like I'm telling you and he keeps holding up the human centipede movies and the warden keeps going.
623000	641000	That's stupid and you're supposed to be like this movie so self aware forty five minutes into it but it's not self aware enough to not exist which would be a truly like that would be a move on its part and be like oh I understand what this movie shouldn't exist.
641000	655000	But instead the accountant so I wrote this down the accountant gets very frustrated Jeff. He loses his cool at forty five minutes forty five minutes of castration and rape and horrible like just terrible.
655000	668000	So what Eli Roth were mid second act or late second act here. Well I mean let's be serious structure eludes the human centipede.
668000	688000	What would Joseph Campbell call this scene. I think Joseph Campbell would say like the people in the movie like human centipede movies themselves like experiment with what defines a movie like like the whole point of the movie is oh could you poop into a mouth.
688000	707000	And I don't think a story even. How many people are putting into how many mouths in the third one. Like I told you five hundred five hundred people. It's a prison full of people but it seems like the wouldn't the food as a body digests whatever food comes through it and we're getting less and less.
707000	721000	Focus in the movie about how medically accurate it is like and I can't tell. I can't tell if the director is like for real or not. I can't tell. Everything's very tongue in cheek but the tongue is like poking through the cheek and there's like a butthole where the tongue is in the cheek.
721000	736000	Like I don't know. I don't know what. I don't know if the movie is nothing if not. It's all about being tongue in cheek. So what I have no idea. So I've watched all three of them. And at one point in the in the third movie.
736000	758000	The accountant at the prison. He gets so fed up 45 minutes into the hour. I think it's a 90 minute movie halfway through the movie putting this on a structural levels of the first Hulk movie where the Hulk appears like in the third act.
758000	772000	This guy the accountant like goes like. And he just throws like a Ned Beatty and network fit like he does a little monologue and he goes. And I wrote it down. I backed it up and I transcribed his monologue.
772000	790000	And he says. By the way the accountant is the guy from human centipede two. For those eight people who watch the second one. The guy in the black and white human centipede two which is the more pulpy and war ish one.
790000	809000	He plays the accountant. So he and he goes. I have been trying to tell you for days now. I have the answer to all our problems. We've got to make a human centipede of our prisoners.
809000	838000	Sown ass to mouth. Sharing one digestive system. No more prison fights. No more assaults on guards. No more disrespect. They will literally be on their knees begging you for mercy. And it's the ultimate deterrent for those considering a career in crime.
838000	866000	That should be the crawl at the beginning of the movie. That should be the voiceover during the trailer. I hadn't shared that before right. What's that. OK. I don't know. The show's an alcoholic. I don't know. I like your new glasses Dan. That's it. I got nothing from now on. We're freewheeling. I can't. Yeah I got I got glasses. My eyeballs are not perfectly round. Big deal. So they told me.
868000	897000	For those not watching Dan can't lift the mic higher than Mike said. Well it's tight and I couldn't loosen it. So my eyeballs aren't perfectly round. So when I look far away like when I look at these people who came to the show late. I like I can't see I guess like pixel perfect. Like I have a one pixel blur and everything like far away. That's what these glasses are for.
899000	912000	You look good. That's why I'm wearing them. It's not. It's not because it improves anything. I told you earlier I said this this Dan to be spectacle Dan is the Dan that will write movies. I've started to notice that people are treating me different.
913000	924000	So I'm now trapped in these glasses that actually make it very hard to function like within eight feet. Like I'm like tripping over things but I'm like everyone likes me now.
925000	933000	And I'm not kidding. It's not a it's not a joke. I can see. OK. Oh look at that speaker. It's black.
933000	949000	But the real thing is that bartenders are nice to me now. That's it. It's like a disguise. But I'm thinking like maybe I should. I don't know. I don't need glasses. I have 20 20 vision.
950000	964000	All right. So I want to. What I would like to do is. Is like to do a little experiment. I'd like to take off all my clothes.
964000	987000	And show you my dick. And I'd like to ask you if it's big. I'd like you to lie to me. I'd like you to say it's big. And the reason I want you to do that is because I think it's small. And I don't want to live in that world.
987000	1010000	So it's not so much an experiment as it is just sort of exercise in my dishonesty. I'm ashamed of my tiny penis. So when you say tiny is it is it freak show tiny or is it just like a define freak show tiny. I don't know. We live in a world where nobody knows about each other's dicks.
1010000	1033000	Like we don't know what's going on. We've created a whole mythology. I don't know. We watch movies about guys with giant monster dicks. Are those regular sized dicks. Yeah. See I mean I don't know. What are those. Are they giant dicks. Are those regular sized dicks. No thank you.
1033000	1062000	I don't know. And like women are also like kind of like pseudo conditioned to like they know how fucked up we are about it. So they don't. They're also not honest about it. They're like they know that they're not supposed to say whether they know if a dick is small or not. Admit it right. You guys learned that early on in your life. Like eight years old you learned to lie about dicks.
1064000	1078000	And men are also like lie about my dick. None of us in this room know what a dick is supposed to look like. There's no who here thinks they have a regular dick. Raise your hand if you have a regular dick.
1078000	1107000	There's two guys sitting right next to each other. Two guys. Two really well dressed gentlemen. Both. They are your brothers. Your brothers. Are you guys twins. Oh okay. Wait. Wait. Get out on stage. Two brothers regular. Okay. If you want to. If you want to. Regular dick brothers. You always got to add if you want to. Grab one or two mics depending on what anybody did ever say. Well I was forced up on stage. All right. So you talk about my dick.
1108000	1137000	First off what are your names. Joe. Joe and Ian. Joe and Ian. And you guys have various. You're wearing similar shoes. Yeah. Yeah. Both have nice brown shoes on. You're both well dressed. You're both brothers. What's the age difference between you guys. Seven years. Who's. I'm the older. You're the older. You're the older. And you guys when Dan said who thinks they have a regular dick as one. Both of your hands. As though he asked what's two plus two.
1139000	1167000	So what. Yeah. Let's talk about all of that. Okay. I reckon about six and a half inches is average. And about the. All right. And about. Let me explain the girth to. Woman that is listed. No get up on stage. Get up on stage. I'm estimating the girls to be about. Joe and Ian. No lady come up here. Because otherwise we either come up or be quiet. You can't do that. Yeah. These guys are heroes. Seven. Seven on each side.
1167000	1196000	Seven. Seven on a good day when I'm well hydrated. So. And about the girth of a roll of silver dollars. So. Wait what. Silver dollars with Kennedy's. Like Kennedy dollars. The girth on average. A roll of silver dollars. Yeah. And a roll of coins. How many. How many. I'm estimating. I'm estimating there's about. The diameter is a silver dollar. Correct. Thank you.
1196000	1225000	Susan B. Anthony penis. No. No. No. No. You're thinking of quarters. Those are quarters. How many. How many. How many. How many. What do you reckon. What do you reckon the role of silver dollars is about about 50 of them in there. Pardon. Oh no. Fifty dollars in the role of silver dollars. You have huge dicks. That's why you raise your hand. I estimate average. There's six and a half. I wouldn't call that huge dick. They're saying that they're calling that median. It's a woman in the back of a silver dollar. A woman back there said nip. She instantly said nip.
1225000	1254000	She instantly said no dice. The diameter of a silver dollar. Her barometer is off. I'm just gonna guess. She needs recalibration. You guys have her respect because you're up here. So. I have three million questions. I'm going to start with. I'm going to pick one at random. Do you guys know what each other's dick looks like? No. No. Not adult. No. You guys both raised. You guys both raised your hands and didn't even look at the other guy. You guys both knew that.
1255000	1283000	We were brothers. We got the same dick. Genetic confidence. Well they didn't. I'll jump in. Alright please. We're a pretty similar mindset. I think that you influenced me growing up. Both of you. Oh Christ. By applause. You're Ian. You're Joe. That's Ian. That's right. By applause. Who thinks Ian has the bigger dick of the two? I just got a text message. That's not important.
1283000	1312000	By applause. Who thinks Ian has the bigger dick? Wow. Alright well. I guess I'm fine. Joe are they right? You said Ian twice which doesn't help. Right now he probably does. So are you guys right now or either of you like hard? No. No. Because I'm just. I don't know. Well so how do you. Alright. We got a lot to talk about tonight.
1313000	1341000	I would just say. Look at body language. This guy's sitting with legs wide open. Ian over there got his legs crossed. Yeah definitely well. Something to hide or he's afraid of showing how big that fucking dick is with those fucking. With that tan suit on. Alright so. I just want to. I want to get back to this metric thing. The diameter of a silver dollar. That's upsetting to me. And tell me about the length. The length. Six and a half.
1341000	1367000	What does that mean? Six and a half silver dollars? No no no. Inches. Inches. I don't know what that. What is that? What is that? I mean. It's just over half a foot. I want to go call Erin and apologize. I don't think I have a very big penis.
1368000	1393000	I think she puts up with a lot. No. Well don't say it like that. I mean just. Like. If I'm telling you that my dick is small. It's small. What you should say is it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. You shouldn't say it right after I tell you to say it. You should figure out how to convince me of it.
1393000	1406000	So you guys are brothers and you've never looked at each other's dicks. The audience thinks that the brother who talks the last and keeps his legs open has a bigger dick. That's easy to understand. I didn't realize that's where we landed on that but.
1406000	1433000	All right. You guys won't show us your dicks. We could make podcast history tonight. I mean like that's not. Am I allowed to ask? I'm not saying you have to do it. I think the state of Oregon might have something to say about that.
1433000	1457000	But I feel like we have a we have a private podcast network. We're streaming. I think Erin's a lucky woman no matter what. Thank you. Nigel. Thank you. Change the subject. Joining everybody. Joining. Thank you so much for coming up fellows. Thank you guys. That's been Dick talk.
1457000	1486000	That's a spin off. Those guys are. There's something weird going on. I want to believe they're not actually brothers. I think they're like time travelers or. That's weird. They drink at the same time. They drink. Maybe a local morning radio show. Like Mike and Amy. What's the deal with Mike and Amy?
1486000	1515000	They're all over town. Anyways. You guys don't want to see my dick. Do you? Oh you do. I think you owe it to them. Ridiculous. Like terrible terrible terrible society. Have some respect. I think we should early on bring up Spencer Crittenden.
1515000	1544000	Oh yeah. Super adventure. Super adventure. Super adventure. Super adventure. Got adventure. OK. I'm sorry. So that human centipede movie.
1544000	1573000	They don't have any human centipedes that are like a full circuit. Do they now. No they never see. That's the third fucking movie. Right. First human centipede then giant human centipede then fucking human centipede. That's rolling all over Manhattan connected. Yeah. It's you know it's efficient. You can move in a circle. You just have to ab exercises. You'll be rolling up and down the city. No crawling around.
1573000	1602000	It's all communication. That's what I do. If I had a human centipede. But I told you guys this. I feel like. Did I. Did I talk about human centipede or any. Yeah. Yeah. On the last. No just just today just earlier. You know tonight. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not that fucked up. Well then I meant a week ago.
1603000	1628000	That scared the shit out of me. I was like I did didn't I. No but I. So I didn't tell you guys like when they. So Eric Roberts plays the governor and the third one. Eric Roberts. Which makes him either the most interesting actor in the world or obviously in a lot of tax problem. Like and he's. He.
1629000	1651000	Comes at the I don't want to spoil anything but I think it's fine but it turns out a bunch of people get so an ass to mouth in a chain and Eric Roberts comes into the prison and he's the governor and he wants to know what they've done to solve their problems and the guy shows him and he makes this speech.
1651000	1669000	The doctor and he the warden says and he goes yes feed feed and I wrote this this monologue down and he he goes and so Eric Roberts since he's gotten to the prison has not said a word at all. He's just he's just walked in.
1670000	1691000	And it's just Eric Roberts walking and watching as this guy gives him a tour of 500 people sewn ass to mouth and how did well how are those stored exactly. Is it like zigzag back and yeah it's a it's a Photoshop like of guys. It's so they're like looking through a window or something.
1691000	1712000	Yeah it's like a noodle of guys in a prison yard and it's clearly photoshopped and it's lame so he walked along the chain of them and he goes yes feed a Jew behind a Muslim a Muslim behind a Jew a Republican behind a Mexican.
1713000	1715000	Whoa.
1715000	1743000	Behind a blood he never he never counters the Mexican and the Republican like peace on earth goodwill to men and then Eric Roberts says his first line which is this is too much this is this is too much says governor Eric Roberts this really is the living end.
1743000	1749000	This is too much anyways that's I thought it was a charming film.
1750000	1766000	I'm surprised that you you you curled up in bed and watched him in centipede three Aaron was out of town and I like I don't know I just like watching horror movies when she's out of town and I've always wondered if you could eat diarrhea.
1767000	1787000	And if you did could you poop it into another person's mouth and and if that person could poop it into another person's mouth and if that could could happen for four hundred ninety seven other people and what would happen to the four hundred ninety seventh person.
1788000	1795000	Oh so what happens in the movie like what happens they don't address it they don't address the one thing that you're wondering about which is could this actually happen.
1796000	1821000	I wonder in that well I would just he shows the five hundred man centipede and then where does he go from there they try to escape or what no no so yeah so he goes home and makes toast or what what happens the protagonist is the prison warden yes so what does he do from then on or is that the end that's Eric Roberts looks at it are you guys cool with me spoiling the movie it's human centipede.
1821000	1835000	Eric Roberts looks at it and goes this is too much and then he says something like God damn that's it and then he leaves and that's the prison warden like shoots the doctor that helped him do it.
1836000	1841000	Eric Roberts comes back and goes you know what this is the best.
1842000	1855000	So it's like a Twilight Zone moment it's like an old Henry novel but with no stakes yeah because the guys like Eric Roberts doesn't come back and go you know what this is the best what you shot the doctor.
1856000	1865000	He doesn't he doesn't are they trying to rehabilitate the prisoners in any way like yes there's never there's never one hundred and eighteen eat enough poop ago I'm ready to go straight.
1865000	1881000	Oh oh there's another part to it which is that the there's what do you do with the death row people and the life sentence people and he made a human what does he call it human caterpillar which means he cuts off their arms and legs.
1882000	1885000	So there's just like that's just an extra thing.
1889000	1910000	And I'm going to shock you guys and tell you it's worth watching this movie because I don't I think they are there in the you know labs right now smashing particles together because they want to know what happens when you do something terrible you know like like and we learned about how the universe works because you smash two atoms together it goes.
1911000	1932000	And they go like what's that it's a cork it's a sub boson if you're not if you're going to watch Robert Zemeckis movies your whole life you're not going to learn what life is you watch human centipede I think you gain some insight into like I don't know it's not a popular opinion but I think it's an important film.
1932000	1955000	Is it a closed circuit like the movie no it's on Netflix and Jeff no I mean didn't you say earlier there's a ring of people all going in a thing or no yeah there's no there's a final guy and he poops but they never show that part there's a front guy that they never show that part.
1956000	1979000	They don't show is that guy's poop extra poopy there's no way just water there's no way no matter how much you fed the first prisoner that is going to make that food will make it to the 500th guy I'm saying the same thing you're saying yeah and I feel like the movie is like I actually felt in the third one I felt like you could feel like the director's heart wasn't in it like he was just doing it for the fans.
1980000	2000000	Season six community kind of like I'm sorry I'm sorry it's funny cuz it's true they loved it I guess thanks guys thanks did you feel like I sewed the ass of community to its own mouth enough.
2001000	2012000	I told the show was eating poop and you can let it go all right so all right so here's the thing about tonight's show terrible.
2012000	2023000	Terrible got nothing nothing to do but from terrible shows terrible pizza.
2026000	2035000	No okay wishful thinking can we bump people out and tell them who didn't appear in the show tonight.
2036000	2057000	Well we were gonna have kid and play but they I think yeah I know we were gonna have good play I'm pretty sure that I thought I feel like play hates kid I really do I really do I wasn't there and I was like actually kind of relieved but they didn't show up because the tension is unbearable.
2057000	2086000	I feel like play hates kid play hates kid it really does it's the gods honest truth it's not it sounds like a joke you'd make do you feel like a kid and or play right here right now that you could hold your own in a rap battle with either kids or play well I feel like if you played a rap beat for me right now I could beat them in a rap battle because they're not here.
2088000	2104000	I don't know they'll never know should we find out if that maybe is a local freestyle here that wants to come up and no no I mean you seem pretty confident right now that you that you have the goods just let me lay down a baseline but you don't want to know if anyone out here just let me rap okay.
2105000	2117000	Do you want to party beat me or do you want something else party beat party party I call it the party beat beats like family family yeah yeah okay.
2124000	2125000	I think there's these.

2246000	2247000	Fuck your mama.
2247000	2254240	Oh shit, why am I facing this way?
2254240	2256560	I had my eyes closed the whole time.
2256560	2261240	I wrapped so hard that I ended up like looking 45 degrees that way.
2261240	2264140	I think you might have beaten Kid but not Play.
2264140	2265240	Yeah.
2265240	2266260	One of those guys sucks.
2266260	2268340	You know it.
2268340	2273620	Alright, let's meet some people tonight.
2273620	2276440	Jesus.
2277240	2280320	I'm sorry I got so drunk you guys.
2280320	2283360	Who's a terrible person?
2283360	2284360	Who's the worst person ever?
2284360	2285360	That guy's hand went up first.
2285360	2286360	They look like it's 45 hands whenever.
2286360	2287360	I love that.
2287360	2289600	Well, everybody feels like they're a bad person.
2289600	2297920	Oh yeah, I'd just like to say anytime anyone blocks anyone on Twitter, that person deserved
2297920	2298920	it.
2298920	2299920	I'm sorry.
2299920	2301680	I see all these people.
2301680	2302840	Why'd you block me?
2302840	2303840	I don't know.
2303840	2306040	I'm sure you deserved it.
2306040	2307040	Let's hear his story.
2307040	2308040	Do you want to come up?
2308040	2309040	Let's work it out.
2309040	2310640	Let's hear it.
2310640	2313400	This guy's been blocked by Spencer on Twitter.
2313400	2316680	Yo, he's blocked by Spencer.
2316680	2319760	Oh, he fucked my fuck.
2319760	2321320	He can't read my tweet.
2321320	2323320	What's your name, sir?
2323320	2324320	Mark.
2324320	2325320	Pardon?
2325320	2326320	Mark.
2326320	2327320	Hello, Mark.
2327320	2328320	Oh, this guy.
2328320	2331000	No, I don't know.
2331000	2332000	It was brief.
2332000	2333000	He doesn't actually remember me.
2333000	2334680	What did you tweet?
2334680	2339280	It was during the Ferguson riots.
2339280	2340840	I get worked up over those.
2340840	2342760	Neither of us are racist at all.
2342760	2348840	That's why I kind of feel bad about it because we're kind of on the same side, but he tweeted
2348840	2355840	some Martin Luther King quote that made it sound like he would have loved the riots,
2355840	2358320	and I disagreed, and we got a little argument, and then he was...
2358320	2361360	I didn't even realize he blocked me until months later, actually, and I tried to tweet
2361360	2362360	at him.
2362360	2363360	That's how I do it.
2363360	2364360	I don't know if he was just thinking about it for a while or what, but at some point
2364360	2365360	he went back.
2365360	2378920	This feels like a particular tragedy because you guys both love Martin Luther King.
2378920	2382840	You know, I don't think it's a tragedy.
2382840	2384680	I just think it's life, man.
2384680	2386560	People drift in and out.
2386560	2388160	Sometimes you catch a wave.
2388160	2392320	Sometimes you catch not the beach.
2392320	2394080	I just think that life is...
2394080	2395080	Okay.
2395080	2397360	I don't know.
2397360	2399000	That sounds vaguely familiar.
2399000	2401560	Here's the thing about Martin Luther King.
2401560	2406160	He says that people, you know, riots aren't great, but people only do it when literally
2406160	2408240	nothing else has worked thus far.
2408240	2409920	I think it's pretty valid.
2409920	2416040	Also, I think that white people shouldn't be talking about what Martin Luther King meant
2416040	2418320	if it's not in the support of black people.
2418320	2422680	Like maybe he said stuff that wouldn't support black people in their struggles, but I'll
2422680	2425400	wait for a black guy to say that, and that might be racist.
2425400	2427160	I'll admit it.
2427160	2429160	I guess it's not.
2429160	2431400	Spencer's admitting he's racist.
2431400	2432800	What do you have to say?
2432800	2435080	I actually, I agree with that.
2435080	2439360	Well, the second point's kind of weird because he's the one quoting him, but the first point
2439360	2444840	I agree with, but we weren't able to talk about it further.
2444840	2445840	And you know what?
2445840	2446840	I think that's fine.
2446840	2447920	I'm fine with the outcome.
2447920	2448920	No offense.
2448920	2456160	Because you got blocked so the discussion had to cease.
2456160	2457160	You must have said something fucked up.
2457160	2458160	Will you accept my apology, Spencer?
2458160	2459160	What's up?
2459160	2460160	Will you accept my apology?
2460160	2461160	Oh, yeah.
2461160	2462460	No, it's not like I'm like super upset.
2462460	2467560	It's just when I block someone, I'm like, am I going to lose by not having to see this
2467560	2468560	guy's tweets anymore?
2468560	2471560	And if the, and you know, that's a very high bar.
2471560	2476760	It honestly is like, I mean, Dan might pass that bar, but very few people and Dan's a
2476760	2478000	great tweeter.
2478000	2481040	He's great on Twitter, but yeah, it's just, it's just that.
2481040	2485520	It's like, if someone makes me, uh, sends me a tweet that like makes me upset or sad,
2485520	2487440	it's like, I don't want to feel like that anymore.
2487440	2489160	Oh, wait, I don't have to.
2489160	2490600	I don't get on Twitter for this.
2490600	2491600	Yeah.
2491600	2492600	That's what I told people.
2492600	2494640	And it's really, it really isn't personal.
2494640	2496200	It's just, it's a knee jerk reaction.
2496200	2497400	You didn't get on Twitter for that.
2497400	2498400	I didn't take it.
2498400	2499400	Boo.
2499400	2500400	Boo.
2500400	2502000	No, no, no, no.
2502000	2506200	Mark, I didn't, I didn't take it personally, but don't, don't you think that's what isn't
2506200	2507200	added?
2507200	2510600	Well, maybe not in its best because that can get ugly and maybe it did, but don't you think
2510600	2515840	that's what social media, I do not think Twitter is for discussions of any sort.
2515840	2520320	No, I think it's a terrible medium for discussing.
2520320	2523880	I agree with that Facebook.
2523880	2525640	Great for yelling at people.
2525640	2526640	Yeah.
2526640	2528400	Twitter is like skywriting.
2528400	2531920	You write it in the sky and it blows away and let's fucking let that be the end of it.
2531920	2536080	And if you, if you feel differently than you tweet differently, you don't have to tell
2536080	2541200	a guy he's wrong on Twitter or you could, I mean, I'm not going to stop you, he'll block
2541200	2542200	your ass.
2542200	2543200	Yeah.
2543200	2548080	Like your name, like your name was like, isn't that a couple of steps better than just hashtag
2548080	2550160	that awkward moment and that kind of stuff?
2550160	2551160	Wait, what?
2551160	2552160	Wait, what?
2552160	2555640	You know, like, just like there's some, I think it's at least creating some discussion
2555640	2559200	even if it was so it's just, it's not creating good discussion.
2559200	2564880	It's creating very vitriolic, disjointed, hard to follow discussion that probably drives
2564880	2565880	people against each other.
2565880	2567120	But I really brings them together.
2567120	2570600	I really want to know what the fucking tweet was because I bet you a million dollars in
2570600	2572200	your tweet was dickish.
2572200	2577480	I, it was, it was not fucking, you were not George, but I'm going like, no, no, do you
2577480	2578480	consider this?
2578480	2579640	He's wearing a Celtic shirt.
2579640	2580640	You know, it was fucking dickish.
2580640	2581640	I'm from Boston.
2581640	2586480	I'm from Boston because you were like, Oh, have you considered this or that you were,
2586480	2587480	you made a boo-boo.
2587480	2590960	I can't quote a verbatim, but I can pretty much tell you what it said.
2590960	2594760	He quoted the thing that's, you know, like you said, it used to be truthful, Martin Luther
2594760	2599360	King said, when, when nothing else writes all that's left, we don't have to do basically.
2599360	2603560	That's also not verbatim, but, um, no, it's not, I never claimed it was.
2603560	2610240	And then I, and then I said, I'm not something like, I'm not sure he would have really said
2610240	2615840	because the FBI murdered him and then I said, I'm not sure he said, wait, sorry, you said
2615840	2618480	you're not sure that he would have.
2618480	2619680	That's exactly what he was saying.
2619680	2623600	And then Spencer said, fuck off, man, some other stuff.
2623600	2624800	Did you say fuck off, man?
2624800	2625800	I might not.
2625800	2626800	I don't know.
2626800	2627800	All right.
2627800	2633240	Mark, Mark, what's your Twitter handle so we can all follow you and then block you the
2633240	2634240	next day?
2634240	2640200	Do I, do you really want me to, do you have, you don't have to, you don't have to almost
2640200	2641200	as a social experiment.
2641200	2643040	I'd like you to see what kind of tweets, sure, sure.
2643040	2644040	It's totally up to you.
2644040	2650520	It's, uh, at not pennies boat, but the, uh, the O's are zeros at it's a lost rumble.
2650520	2656480	It's not at Norman's bow, what at not, not pennies boat.
2656480	2664240	So that's N zero T P E N N Y S B zero a T. Yep.
2664240	2665240	Yeah, that's it.
2665240	2666240	All right.
2666240	2667240	All right.
2667240	2668240	Well, thank you.
2668240	2669240	And yeah, Mark, everybody.
2669240	2670240	Mark.
2670240	2671240	Thank you, sir.
2671240	2672240	He deserved it.
2672240	2680400	And if he, if he makes sense to you, you could like petition Spencer.
2680400	2684760	Hey man, I don't want ill will, like I said, I block people on Twitter just because I don't
2684760	2685920	want to feel bad.
2685920	2686920	Yeah.
2686920	2687920	That's me.
2687920	2688920	Yeah.
2688920	2689920	You're like me.
2689920	2690920	Yeah.
2690920	2691920	Devin Farachi, you know, he gets a lot of Twitter hate.
2691920	2692920	He was, he was yelling.
2692920	2699320	Oh, you think that blocking people shoot abuse at you is, is creating an echo chamber.
2699320	2703680	Why don't I come and stop your house from being an echo chamber by calling your kids
2703680	2706640	pieces of shit every single second of the day?
2706640	2707640	Yeah.
2707640	2708640	It's, it's valid.
2708640	2709640	Yeah.
2709640	2712320	Why, why, why does anybody on Twitter get on Twitter?
2712320	2714560	I could do that for me too.
2714560	2720440	So does everyone get, is Twitter like a, is part of the, is the slogan of Twitter, uh,
2720440	2727360	Hey, confront your, uh, hero, confront your hypocrisy, get on Twitter.
2727360	2728920	That's why everyone's on Twitter, right?
2728920	2733120	Cause it's a big opportunity to be told you're a piece of shit, right?
2733120	2737600	I find that everyone with 130 followers gets on Twitter because they love hearing that
2737600	2740160	they're a big giant piece of shit every day.
2740160	2742200	And just to be clear, that's not this guy's crime.
2742200	2743200	He was much more reasonable.
2743200	2744200	I'm sure.
2744200	2745200	Yeah, I know.
2745200	2750080	I find that Twitter, Twitter is the perfect, uh, uh, place to tell me that, uh, they don't
2750080	2754040	like what I'm doing with Teen Wolf on MTV.
2754040	2756080	Is there anybody, this is an interesting segment.
2756080	2761880	Is there anybody here in Portland that, uh, have I blocked anybody that, uh, I don't
2761880	2765720	know, felt, felt unfairly blocked or, okay, good.
2765720	2766720	That's nice.
2766720	2767720	It's Portland.
2767720	2768720	See?
2768720	2769720	They're all cool.
2769720	2770720	Say what?
2770720	2779960	Oh, you've, you've blocked people that tried to tell you that Hitler was an atheist.
2779960	2784680	Why do people, why do people keep telling you that?
2784680	2786880	Sometimes you run some kind of Hitler museum.
2786880	2792720	No, I'm telling you, what sort of God-fearing man, what sort of garden have you, have you
2792720	2796680	tilled that makes that flower grow?
2796680	2799960	Also that was such a sticking point for you that you yelled it out in an almost totally
2799960	2808840	unrelated context, like speaking of the internet, which is fine.
2808840	2809840	You're fine.
2809840	2810840	Yeah.
2810840	2813360	I think we should all, we should, we should all block people who try to convince us that
2813360	2817080	Hitler was an atheist because that seems like a terrible waste of time.
2817080	2819320	You should never try to convince anybody that Hitler was anything.
2819320	2824960	I think he was into the, he was into the occult and all sorts of weird shit, right?
2824960	2825960	Wait.
2825960	2831200	So are you, are you saying that Hitler's an atheist?
2831200	2834040	No, no, he's saying Hitler's not.
2834040	2835040	Sounds like what you're saying, bro.
2835040	2836040	That's what he's saying though, right?
2836040	2837880	It sounds like what you're saying, man.
2837880	2840920	He thinks you protest too much about Hitler's atheism.
2841480	2843560	No, obviously Hitler was a Catholic, right?
2843560	2844560	Yeah.
2844560	2845560	Like all of us.
2845560	2846960	He was Church of England all the way, man.
2846960	2847960	Church of England?
2847960	2848960	He was Church of England.
2848960	2853720	He was C, he was COE all the way.
2853720	2858040	Also Hitler didn't drink, but there's a picture of him with a frenet bronca in front of him.
2858040	2859440	He drank, I love frenet bronca.
2859440	2862840	He drank a frenet bronca before every speech, apparently, to settle his nerves.
2862840	2866560	So, you know, he also drank, didn't he do coke?
2866560	2869680	I'd always imagine him doing coke before those speeches.
2869680	2874680	Hitler used to do coke off Rommel's tits before every speech.
2874680	2881000	All right, speaking of Hitler, hey, Malcolm, are you out there?
2881000	2882000	Where are you, Malcolm?
2882000	2883000	Is that you?
2883000	2884000	He's there.
2884000	2888240	Would you be willing to come up here and be made a little bit of fun of?
2888240	2890520	All right, Malcolm, come up here.
2890520	2892040	The crowd says yes.
2892040	2894640	This is Malcolm.
2894640	2898320	Malcolm is 11 years old.
2898320	2901840	Malcolm was, here, grab one of these microphones.
2901840	2902840	Malcolm, you're 11?
2902840	2905800	Well, no, I'm being facetious.
2905800	2909840	Malcolm is a star child who was put in charge of me.
2909840	2913760	You're like an intern or a volunteer that works for the festival?
2913760	2914760	No.
2914760	2915760	Okay.
2915760	2920200	I already like Malcolm.
2920200	2928120	First of all, as I keep telling you, calm down.
2928120	2930640	So okay, so you're not a volunteer for the festival?
2930640	2936280	Well, I offered to be a volunteer and I showed up and then was asked to, if you need anything,
2936280	2939320	get you that thing.
2939320	2941280	Is this Mike On or is he being that subtle?
2941280	2942280	He's...
2942280	2943280	No, he's not doing a bit.
2943280	2944280	This is why I wanted to ring him up.
2944280	2946280	He's holding the mic far away.
2946280	2947280	When your parents...
2947280	2950280	It's not out of the direction, I'll...
2950280	2951280	Conceived.
2951280	2955600	That's a callback to last week.
2955600	2959880	Your parents were both on Xanax when you were conceived.
2959880	2962080	Is my theory.
2962080	2965680	He's unflappable.
2965680	2974360	He's like Rick O'Kaysick without the pizzazz.
2974360	2975360	You don't have...
2975360	2976360	Wait, wait.
2976360	2977360	I was...
2977360	2980800	Malcolm, I've not met you.
2980800	2982680	I have no horse in this race.
2982680	2984980	I didn't hear what you said, but you said it very softly.
2984980	2988700	You offered to be a volunteer, but then what happened?
2988700	2997580	I showed up as a maybe volunteer and they asked me to, if you need anything, get you
2997580	3002180	that thing.
3002180	3004940	I still have no idea what's going on.
3004940	3009700	They asked you to be a volunteer and then...
3009700	3013100	Are you mad or happy right now?
3014100	3017700	Do you know what those words mean?
3017700	3019700	Dan, how did you guys meet?
3019700	3021340	What's your origin story with Malcolm?
3021340	3022340	This is it.
3022340	3023900	This is why I wanted to share...
3023900	3025460	Isn't this interesting?
3025460	3026460	How did you first...
3026460	3027620	Where did your paths first cross?
3027620	3030020	You've been told you're interesting, right?
3030020	3031020	Yes.
3031020	3033860	You're not...
3033860	3035860	You don't feel bullied right now, right?
3035860	3038060	That would not be a thing I would want to do.
3038060	3039060	Okay.
3039060	3041900	You feel celebrated because that is what I want to do.
3041900	3044180	I think we're all on Malcolm's side right now.
3044180	3045180	Yes.
3045180	3046180	He's the hero.
3046180	3052020	But we all want to know what is happening in your bloodstream.
3052020	3054020	How do we get this way?
3054020	3055020	Hemoglobin.
3055020	3056020	Hemoglobin.
3056020	3058020	They're doing their thing.
3058020	3059020	It's true.
3059020	3060540	I think he doesn't have adrenaline.
3060540	3061540	Oh, sorry.
3061540	3062740	You don't have adrenaline.
3062740	3064460	That's the working theory.
3064460	3068540	You don't have an adrenaline gland.
3068540	3070540	See?
3071180	3072980	All right.
3072980	3073980	Is there a...
3073980	3078100	Since you're a good sport and came up here and we're exploited, is there a...
3078100	3081620	But I almost hesitate to ask this because I feel like it's just going to backfire.
3081620	3084420	Is there an ambition that you have?
3084420	3085980	Nope.
3085980	3090660	Where do you see yourself in five years?
3090660	3092660	What do you think he was going to say?
3092660	3093660	Oh, yeah.
3093660	3095180	I want to be a veterinarian.
3095180	3096180	I love animals.
3096180	3097180	I'm just here.
3097180	3098180	You are?
3098820	3105420	Dan, Dan, Dan, where did you guys first meet?
3105420	3108340	He was assigned to me by the festival.
3108340	3109340	In what capacity?
3109340	3110340	Anything you need.
3110340	3111340	Malcolm will get it.
3111340	3112340	Right?
3112340	3113340	And then I...
3113340	3114340	You're an adult.
3114340	3115340	And he's been...
3115340	3116340	You haven't needed anything.
3116340	3117340	I haven't really needed a lot.
3117340	3118340	You got this.
3118340	3119340	He's a dream gig.
3119340	3120340	You got this.
3120340	3121340	Right.
3121340	3122340	A couple...
3122340	3123340	A little bit of Kettle One.
3123340	3124340	I know how that is.
3124340	3128140	Malcolm, how old are you if we may ask?
3129100	3130100	22.
3130100	3138380	That's the best answer he could have said.
3138380	3143460	Malcolm, what's the thing that gets you out of bed in the morning and puts you to sleep
3143460	3144460	at night?
3144460	3150140	Do you have an overriding passion like music or literature or a certain love of your life
3150140	3151700	of any sort?
3151700	3153700	Are you this self-contained at all times?
3153700	3157140	I guess I'm just not ready to die yet.
3157140	3161100	I don't...
3161100	3164020	Was that an answer to the question?
3164020	3165020	It was...
3165020	3167020	And yet, it's an important thing to say.
3167020	3168020	Oh, abs.
3168020	3169020	No, Malcolm.
3169020	3170020	I'm not ready to die yet.
3170020	3172260	Malcolm, is that where you're saying that you're afraid to die?
3172260	3173260	Oh, yes.
3173260	3174260	Yes.
3174260	3175260	Yes.
3175260	3176260	Oh, that's great.
3176260	3177260	Yeah.
3177260	3178260	You do have fear.
3178260	3179260	You have fear.
3179260	3180260	Okay.
3180260	3181260	Malcolm, follow up on that.
3181260	3185140	Is there something that you're afraid before you die that you didn't do or didn't see or
3185140	3186700	accomplish or experience?
3187260	3188260	No.
3188260	3192220	Is there a specific way you're afraid to die?
3192220	3193220	What's the...
3193220	3194220	Okay.
3194220	3196220	Would you rather burn to death or drown?
3196220	3197220	Drown.
3197220	3198220	Yeah.
3198220	3199220	Why?
3199220	3200220	Why?
3200220	3210780	I feel like the point of losing consciousness would occur sooner.
3210780	3212060	Malcolm, are you in a band?
3212060	3215060	Because if not, you need to be in a fucking band.
3215060	3217660	And also, I want to be in that band.
3217660	3218660	What's the bend?
3218660	3219660	Oh, the bend.
3219660	3220660	Do you play anything?
3220660	3221660	Are you musical at all?
3221660	3222660	Oh, no.
3222660	3223660	No?
3223660	3224660	No?
3224660	3225660	No?
3225660	3228660	If you could play an instrument, what would you pick?
3228660	3232780	Hi, it's a piano.
3232780	3234780	Why would you say it like that?
3234780	3237580	I just got a view.
3237580	3238580	Weird.
3238580	3242620	Are you a Bill Hader character?
3242620	3244620	Is there any truth, sir?
3245060	3248340	To the allegations that you are, in fact, a Bill Hader character.
3248340	3249340	You seem like...
3249340	3250340	All right.
3250340	3251340	So, you're 22.
3251340	3252340	Okay.
3252340	3253340	So...
3253340	3254340	All right.
3254340	3257660	You're not ready to die because you're afraid to die.
3257660	3262540	But not because you would regret not having done something.
3262540	3264180	But you want to live.
3264180	3265180	You want to be.
3265180	3266180	You want to exist.
3266180	3267180	Yeah.
3267180	3268180	You ask what gets me out of bed.
3268180	3269180	It's like, oh, I'm here.
3269180	3270180	Yeah.
3270180	3271180	I'm not ready to die.
3271180	3272180	I guess I'll go do a thing.
3272180	3273180	Is there anything that makes you laugh out loud?
3273420	3274420	Do you ever...
3274420	3277820	At any point in the day or the week or the month, like, belly laugh at anything?
3277820	3279820	No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3279820	3281500	What makes you laugh?
3281500	3283060	Anything in particular or just the random things?
3283060	3284060	All right.
3284060	3285060	Cool.
3285060	3286060	More for me.
3286060	3287060	See, this is what I've suspected.
3287060	3288060	What?
3288060	3289100	This is what I've suspected.
3289100	3290100	I couldn't hear.
3290100	3293140	He's answering different questions than the one being asked.
3293140	3296540	I didn't hear what you said.
3296540	3298380	He said more for me.
3298380	3300060	More for me?
3300060	3302380	More comedy for you?
3302380	3303580	That's what I'm saying.
3303580	3304580	He's like...
3304580	3309420	It's like a sort of like Dao De Jing kind of like, your mind comes to a halt.
3309420	3314460	What if he can see, like, the future, like, and he sees, like, questions before you ask
3314460	3318020	him, and that's what's taken him so long to figure it all out.
3318020	3324380	You asked me what would make me laugh, and I said a thing, and I don't know if you noticed,
3324380	3325380	but I laughed.
3325380	3326820	More for him.
3326820	3327820	More for you than...
3327820	3328820	All right.
3328820	3329820	Well, I mean, he's been a good sport.
3329820	3330820	I like this guy.
3331260	3332260	I like this guy.
3332260	3334260	We don't want to, like...
3334260	3341540	Malcolm, because you seem, and this is not, like, I like you on site, I like you all the
3341540	3342540	way through this whole thing.
3342540	3346460	You seem like a cool dude, like, in the, whatever it is you're hiding, I don't think you're
3346460	3347460	hiding much.
3347460	3353500	And I mean, I think, like, whatever it is you're concealing, it's nothing that, you'd
3353500	3356700	probably share anything that we'd ask you if we asked you the right questions.
3356700	3359700	You're not hiding anything, are you?
3360700	3361700	Oh, okay.
3362700	3363700	I don't know what I'm hiding.
3363700	3367700	What's the, is there some, what's the dark side of Malcolm?
3367700	3369700	Is it like, what's you at your worst?
3370700	3374700	What's your behavior when you're ashamed of what you just did?
3374700	3376700	Hmm, I get quiet.
3380700	3381700	All right.
3381700	3383700	Well, shame on you then.
3383700	3384700	He's been a good sport.
3384700	3385700	That's not torture.
3385700	3386700	No, no.
3386700	3389700	I could seriously talk to him for the rest of the night, but let's get, uh...
3389700	3391700	If you see Malcolm out there, buy him a drink.
3391700	3392700	He's, uh...
3392700	3395700	Malcolm, will you do me a favor and move to Los Angeles and come be on the show every
3395700	3396700	week?
3396700	3399700	Yeah, I'm sure we'll all be working for you, because I guess it's, yeah...
3399700	3400700	Malcolm, everybody!
3400700	3401700	Malcolm, thank you, Malcolm.
3401700	3402700	Thank you for coming out.
3402700	3403700	The enigmatic.
3403700	3404700	You did it.
3409700	3410700	I don't know.
3410700	3411700	I don't know.
3412700	3414700	Okay, I'm not gonna sleep well tonight.
3414700	3415700	I didn't get enough fucking answers.
3415700	3416700	Yeah.
3416700	3417700	That's so good.
3417700	3429700	I think if our podcast had done a gig in Columbine at the right time, we could have saved a
3429700	3430700	lot of lives.
3430700	3433700	That's all I kept thinking.
3433700	3438700	I look at him and I see, like, a Ramon and a Rick O'Kasek and, like...
3438700	3439700	Oh, really?
3439700	3440700	Well, we didn't ask him.
3440700	3444700	Like, I see, like, people that, like, kind of live in their own internal world that all
3444700	3448700	of a sudden are volcanoes of some sort of artistic expression.
3448700	3451700	Well, did you guys see the Cobain documentary?
3451700	3454700	Maybe Malcolm is a new Cobain.
3454700	3459700	Maybe he's struggling with stomach pain and he can't wait to try heroin and blow his brains
3459700	3460700	out.
3460700	3462700	And write some great songs.
3462700	3465700	That was a great documentary.
3465700	3470700	Dan, can I make a little interlude here and talk about a place that I went to today before
3471700	3474700	coming here and meeting you at the little bar over there?
3474700	3476700	It's a place I have not been to in six years.
3476700	3478700	It's a strip club called Union Jacks.
3478700	3481700	Are you guys familiar with Union Jacks?
3481700	3484700	Union Jacks is a great little strip club, especially in the daytime.
3484700	3487700	When I went in there today, I was the only guy in there and I was wearing a suit, as
3487700	3493700	I do, and there was one girl on stage, and she wasn't the thinnest of strippers, but
3493700	3496700	she was having the most fun and I loved her and she was fantastic.
3497700	3502700	She was teaching another stripper out on the floor, out in the bar, how to twerk.
3502700	3506700	And then another stripper came in like off the street, like she was coming in like she
3506700	3507700	was on duty.
3507700	3510700	Now there's three of them and I came back from the bathroom so I got in line with them
3510700	3512700	and we're all twerking together.
3512700	3516700	I found out I twerked better than one of them, but worse than the other two.
3516700	3521700	Then one girl came in and she had her arm in a cast, and she got up on stage and she
3521700	3524700	was like, hey, can I do the double lampshade?
3524700	3525700	She named some dance movement.
3525700	3527700	No, you can't do that with your broken arm.
3527700	3528700	But she was doing it.
3528700	3530700	It was the greatest fucking thing in the world.
3530700	3535700	So there was strippers with like eye patches and fucking knee braces and broken arms, and
3535700	3536700	everybody was twerking.
3536700	3539700	And they also, I told them, they said, what are you doing in town?
3539700	3540700	I said, I do a comedy show.
3540700	3542700	They said, bring everybody back after.
3542700	3544700	I said, well, our fans are a little socially awkward.
3544700	3547700	They go, we love socially awkward.
3548700	3553700	So we're all going to Union Jacks and we're all just going to get lap dances together.
3555700	3556700	Yeah?
3556700	3557700	I'm going.
3558700	3559700	Malcolm, you in?
3562700	3564700	Wait, is that Malcolm?
3564700	3565700	He raised his voice.
3565700	3566700	I gotta, I gotta.
3566700	3570700	Malcolm, if nothing else happens this weekend, you and I are going to a strip club together.
3572700	3575700	Oh shit, is, is Ali here?
3575700	3577700	Ali, you're not here, are you?
3577700	3578700	Who?
3578700	3581700	I think our friend Ali couldn't get into the show.
3581700	3582700	I didn't realize.
3582700	3583700	I'm sorry.
3583700	3584700	I'm sorry, Ali.
3584700	3587700	Also, I want to thank Ben for giving us cool records before the show.
3587700	3588700	Ben, you out there?
3588700	3589700	Thank you, brother.
3589700	3591700	Ben gave me a Groovy Everly Brothers thing, and what's it called?
3591700	3593700	Hidden Christians or Secret Christians or?
3593700	3594700	Nervous Christians.
3594700	3595700	Nervous Christians.
3595700	3596700	I never heard of them, but it sounds groovy.
3596700	3597700	All right.
3597700	3598700	Yeah.
3598700	3599700	Okay.
3599700	3600700	So here's the thing.
3600700	3602700	I'm going to show you guys my dick.
3603700	3605700	Oh, I forgot to tell you one last thing about the strip club.
3605700	3606700	Okay.
3606700	3607700	One of the.
3607700	3608700	One more thing.
3608700	3610700	While you look for that, the reason I brought that up, I forgot.
3610700	3616700	One of the strippers there looks exactly like a, you know, suicide girls, like tattooed
3616700	3617700	kind of punk rock chicks.
3617700	3622700	If a stripper was a suicide girl, but looked exactly like King Joffrey from Game of Thrones.
3622700	3626700	And when we go there later on, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
3626700	3628700	That sounds really great, right?
3628700	3629700	Yeah.
3629700	3631700	Like as a girl, that's great.
3631700	3636700	It gave me the strangest half erection of my life.
3636700	3637700	Okay.
3637700	3638700	Okay.
3638700	3639700	So did I talk about this?
3640700	3649700	So I got, I got, I got very, I got very drunk a couple of weeks ago and I, this is a confession.
3649700	3651700	This is a confession segment.
3651700	3656700	This is called rock bottom moment of clarity intervention.
3656700	3657700	Do you want some music?
3657700	3658700	Yeah.
3658700	3660700	It's a new segment because I'm not proud of these moments.
3661700	3664700	Actually, just keep this playing.
3664700	3666700	This is perfect to just keep playing.
3666700	3667700	Okay.
3667700	3668700	So here's what happened.
3668700	3670700	It's going to go through it fast.
3670700	3673700	But when I go through it fast, you're going to be like, what the fuck are you talking
3673700	3674700	about?
3674700	3675700	Why did that happen?
3675700	3678700	The answer is clearly I'm an alcoholic.
3678700	3682700	This track is three and a half minutes long.
3682700	3684700	I had a lot of life.
3684700	3686700	I was like, I'm not a alcoholic.
3686700	3688700	I'm not a alcoholic.
3688700	3698700	I had a few guests over at my house and I farted while backing out of the room.
3698700	3705700	Did you stop it or is it still playing?
3705700	3706700	Okay.
3706700	3709700	And the song just listened to your story.
3709700	3717700	And as soon as I farted, everyone in the room went, oh, which was crazy because it felt
3717700	3721700	like the fart moved at the speed of light.
3721700	3725700	I was like, I was leaving the room to fart.
3725700	3728700	And I was like, you guys smell that?
3728700	3729700	And they're like, yeah.
3729700	3733700	And then one of them said Dustin was there, our producer.
3733700	3736700	I'm farting now, as I say in this story.
3736700	3738700	But that's not important.
3738700	3741700	Just to let the story verse in militude.
3741700	3743700	I heard it.
3743700	3744700	Do you hear it?
3744700	3746700	You can hear it?
3746700	3747700	Oh, no.
3747700	3748700	You heard it?
3748700	3749700	How did you hear it?
3749700	3750700	I heard it.
3750700	3751700	Really?
3751700	3752700	I'm sitting 12 feet away from you.
3752700	3753700	That's crazy.
3753700	3754700	Okay.
3754700	3755700	Okay.
3755700	3756700	That's distracting.
3756700	3760700	The track has two minutes, 10 seconds left.
3760700	3761700	Two minutes, 10.
3761700	3762700	You want to start over?
3762700	3763700	Wait, what?
3763700	3765700	The track is only two minutes long.
3765700	3766700	Oh, shit.
3766700	3767700	Okay.
3767700	3768700	No.
3768700	3769700	Yeah.
3769700	3770700	Okay.
3770700	3771700	So I'm humiliated by this story.
3771700	3773700	That all overshadowed everything.
3773700	3775700	I was backing out of the room and I farted.
3775700	3776700	And then everyone went, ugh.
3776700	3778700	And I was like, you can smell it.
3778700	3780700	And someone said, yeah.
3780700	3784700	Did you shit your pants?
3784700	3786700	And I said, no, no.
3786700	3789700	This is how drunk I was.
3789700	3795700	I went into my bedroom and I took off my pants and my underwear.
3795700	3800700	And I was going to put on pajamas.
3800700	3811700	But instead I walked back into the living room with my underwear to show my house guests
3811700	3816700	that I hadn't shit my pants.
3816700	3822700	And Dustin was there and his girlfriend, Elizabeth, who's like half my age.
3822700	3825700	And I was wearing a t-shirt.
3825700	3828700	And she was like, oh, no.
3828700	3831700	And I was like, no, I didn't shit my pants.
3831700	3834700	And I was like six years old showing them.
3834700	3836700	And everyone was like, get out of here.
3836700	3838700	Get out of here.
3838700	3840700	We can see your balls.
3840700	3841700	We can see your balls.
3841700	3842700	That's what they kept saying.
3842700	3844700	We can see your balls.
3844700	3846700	You came back in with nothing on?
3846700	3847700	I had a t-shirt on.
3847700	3849700	I thought it covered my balls.
3849700	3850700	Oh, no.
3850700	3851700	What?
3851700	3852700	And I'm not bragging.
3852700	3854700	I guess they could still see my balls.
3854700	3856700	That's something you'd risk?
3857700	3859700	I'm not bragging.
3859700	3862700	That is certainly not bragging, sir.
3862700	3864700	I was that drunk.
3864700	3866700	Kids don't drink that much.
3866700	3868700	And I went back in and I put on my pajamas.
3868700	3871700	And I came back in and I was like, I'm so sorry.
3871700	3872700	And they were like, why did you do that?
3872700	3873700	Why did you do that?
3873700	3875700	And I kept going, I wanted you to know I didn't shit my pants.
3875700	3878700	And like, why did you have to?
3878700	3880700	Why couldn't you just say that?
3880700	3882700	That you didn't shit your pants?
3882700	3884700	I didn't think you'd believe me.
3885700	3887700	And they were like, why couldn't you put on pants to come out
3887700	3889700	and show us you didn't shit your pants?
3889700	3892700	And I said, because if I took too long,
3892700	3897700	you'd think I just grabbed fresh underwear to fool you.
3897700	3899700	Because I was six years old in that moment.
3899700	3901700	I was like, it was insane.
3901700	3903700	Like, you guys should not drink as much as you do,
3903700	3905700	is the point of my story.
3905700	3907700	Like, you should be careful.
3907700	3909700	You should take it easy.
3909700	3911700	I'm fine.
3911700	3915700	But you guys are young and you can improve yourselves.
3915700	3917700	If you had shit your pants,
3917700	3919700	would you walk back in and show them that you had or not?
3919700	3920700	No, I would have hit it.
3920700	3923700	I would have thrown them out the window.
3923700	3925700	Now, Dan, our time is shorter.
3925700	3927700	Should we get into a little shadow run or no?
3927700	3928700	Oh, yeah.
3928700	3930700	How much time do we have left?
3930700	3931700	25?
3931700	3933700	We have like 20 minutes.
3933700	3934700	Okay.
3934700	3935700	All right, can I tell you one more thing
3935700	3939700	about the movie Daybreakers with Ethan Hawke?
3940700	3942700	Daybreakers is about vampires.
3942700	3945700	In the future, Daybreakers, vampires,
3945700	3947700	or as we call them, Daybreakers,
3947700	3949700	have taken over the world.
3949700	3952700	And so humans are a minority.
3952700	3956700	And we're using them for their blood.
3956700	3960700	And Ethan Hawke is a phlebotomist,
3960700	3961700	I guess you would call him.
3961700	3963700	He's a blood specialist.
3963700	3966700	And he's talking to his partner in a blood lab.
3966700	3969700	And he goes like, he's working really hard
3969700	3971700	to come up with a synthetic form of blood
3971700	3972700	because he loves humans
3972700	3974700	and he doesn't think we should farm humans.
3974700	3977700	And his partner goes like,
3977700	3980700	yeah, come on, we're ready to go with the synthetic blood.
3980700	3982700	The animal testing's almost finished.
3982700	3986700	And as he says that, he hands Ethan Hawke
3986700	3990700	a headshot of a chimpanzee with fangs.
3990700	3991700	That's it.
3991700	3993700	That's all I wanted to tell you.
3993700	3995700	It's like the best movie that's ever been made.
3995700	3996700	Sounds good.
3996700	3998700	We're almost done with the animal testing.
3998700	4000700	Chimpanzee with fangs.
4000700	4001700	It's like a...
4001700	4006700	Why does the chimpanzee have a headshot?
4006700	4008700	It's like, got fangs.
4008700	4010700	Was it an eight by ten black and white?
4010700	4012700	Yeah, it was black and white, yes.
4012700	4013700	Eight by ten.
4013700	4016700	Yes, eight by ten black and white headshot
4016700	4017700	of a chimpanzee with fangs.
4017700	4019700	It said William Morris Agency at the bottom.
4019700	4021700	Well, yeah, it did not say that.
4021700	4024700	Special talents, Russian accent.
4025700	4026700	Couldn't swim.
4026700	4027700	All right.
4027700	4028700	So, all right.
4028700	4029700	Now, that's it.
4029700	4030700	That's all I wanted to tell everyone.
4030700	4032700	I said we play a little Shadowrun.
4032700	4037700	And I mean, is it a good idea, by applause or a bad idea,
4037700	4039700	if we bring Malcolm up to play Shadowrun?
4039700	4040700	Oh, yeah.
4040700	4042700	Now, Malcolm's got to...
4042700	4044700	Malcolm, come up.
4044700	4045700	Malcolm, would you?
4045700	4046700	Would you mind coming up?
4046700	4048700	Malcolm's got to play.
4048700	4050700	And then we should balance it out.
4050700	4052700	Aaron told me I shouldn't have to...
4052700	4054700	I shouldn't ask for always women,
4054700	4056700	like, because it's like, oh, women are...
4056700	4058700	Because she saw Mad Max, and she's like, well, women aren't...
4058700	4060700	But I was like, well, yeah, but women...
4060700	4063700	She said, like, well, when Des Moines isn't there,
4063700	4065700	you don't ask for a black guy to come up.
4065700	4068700	And I was like, well, race is an artificial construct.
4068700	4070700	Gender is not.
4070700	4073700	Kaboom.
4073700	4076700	We need women up here.
4076700	4078700	All right, get the fuck up here.
4078700	4080700	I like that sort of initiative.
4080700	4083700	You better not be black is my point.
4083700	4085700	Better not be black.
4085700	4086700	Wait, is that Nancy?
4086700	4087700	That's Nancy.
4087700	4088700	Nancy, who we met earlier.
4088700	4089700	Hello, Nancy.
4089700	4091700	If you get a chance afterwards, smell Nancy.
4091700	4093700	She smells terrific.
4093700	4094700	Oh, yeah.
4094700	4096700	Or is that you with the super dimples?
4096700	4097700	Yeah.
4097700	4098700	Look at those dimples.
4098700	4101700	At least it's super nipples.
4101700	4103700	Nancy, you got those super nipples?
4103700	4104700	Those two.
4104700	4105700	Let's do it.
4105700	4106700	Her nipples?
4106700	4109700	Silver dollars.
4109700	4110700	That's a call back to me.
4110700	4112700	It's a call back to the Dick Brothers.
4112700	4113700	I know.
4113700	4114700	I know it is.
4114700	4115700	That's the average nipple size.
4115700	4116700	Is it right?
4116700	4117700	Yeah, a silver dollar.
4117700	4118700	That doesn't matter, right?
4118700	4121700	Are you above or below average, Nancy?
4121700	4123700	Above or below average nipple size?
4123700	4125700	I don't know.
4125700	4127700	Is that the average?
4127700	4130700	You said it with assurance.
4130700	4131700	I'll change the subject.
4131700	4133700	All right.
4133700	4134700	Spencer, would you mind...
4134700	4136700	I'll come over there and pass out the things.
4136700	4138700	Oh, thank you, Jeff.
4138700	4139700	This is enough people.
4139700	4140700	Do you want any other performers?
4140700	4141700	This is plenty.
4141700	4143700	Is my Dick big enough?
4143700	4145700	Yeah, it's fine.
4145700	4149700	It doesn't matter, right?
4149700	4152700	It doesn't matter.
4152700	4154700	You want to be...
4154700	4157700	Who seems to be Camille or Demarge or what?
4157700	4158700	Demarge.
4158700	4160700	Oh, yeah.
4160700	4162700	Malcolm should be Demarge.
4162700	4165700	You're hard of guard.
4165700	4167700	But your Dick...
4167700	4172700	It can be small.
4172700	4178700	And you can still be satisfying to people.
4178700	4179700	Yep.
4179700	4184700	That you sleep with.
4184700	4190700	I'm sure if it's huge, that's great.
4190700	4192700	I'm sure that's great.
4192700	4195700	But it's not that big a deal.
4195700	4198700	It's not that big a deal.
4198700	4202700	It doesn't need to be big alone, is my point.
4202700	4211700	Some people report discomfort with overly large-sized members.
4211700	4216700	Spencer Crittenden reporting.
4216700	4218700	Yep.
4218700	4221700	Just looked it up.
4221700	4224700	Spencer, is it true they call you Coke can?
4224700	4226700	What?
4226700	4229700	I'd say mine is probably...
4229700	4230700	What?
4230700	4232700	5.5 is average, right?
4232700	4234700	These guys are 6.5.
4234700	4236700	Yeah, and I would dispute that.
4236700	4238700	I'd say 5.5 is more.
4238700	4239700	I'm not saying that's mine.
4239700	4241700	I'm saying I think that's what average is.
4241700	4243700	A bit under average.
4243700	4246700	Yeah, with decimal points.
4246700	4249700	6.5 sounds like a lot.
4249700	4251700	6.5 is above average.
4251700	4253700	My Dick is shaped exactly like an ampersand.
4253700	4255700	Silver dollar thing...
4255700	4257700	Silver dollar is above average.
4257700	4259700	Gert, absolutely.
4259700	4261700	Absolutely.
4261700	4265700	Silver dollars are fucking giant.
4265700	4267700	Oh, okay, 50 cent...
4267700	4269700	Wait, what?
4269700	4271700	Yeah, Kennedy, he's got a big dick.
4271700	4273700	Okay, guys, look.
4273700	4275700	We don't have a whole lot of show levels.
4275700	4277700	I'll go to Union Jacks and take our dicks out.
4277700	4279700	We'll fucking settle this shit later on.
4279700	4281700	Spencer, do we have a guest Shadowrun recapper?
4281700	4283700	Yeah, this is Teo from Finland again.
4283700	4285700	Malcolm, how big is your dick?
4285700	4287700	Three.
4289700	4291700	Diameter, he's saying diameter.
4291700	4292700	Yeah.
4292700	4293700	Radius.
4293700	4295700	Three radians.
4295700	4298700	They call him the trashcan lid.
4298700	4300700	800 capsaicin.
4300700	4302700	Super wide, but not very long.
4302700	4304700	All right, are you ready, Spencer?
4304700	4305700	Sure.
4305700	4306700	Let's do this.
4312700	4315700	Last time on Harmon Town.
4315700	4317700	The gang was outside Mind Plus Limited
4317700	4321700	where they cooked up an indeed ingenious infiltration.
4321700	4325700	Jim Nightblade pretended to have a cyber-letic seizure.
4325700	4326700	Seizure.
4326700	4329700	While Mercy and Dr. Friend convinced the clinic's receptionist
4329700	4331700	to admit Jim, it worked.
4331700	4333700	Succeeding in their deception,
4333700	4336700	the team found themselves in the C beta ward
4336700	4339700	where but two security guards hung around.
4339700	4340700	I can't talk.
4340700	4343700	Dr. Friend unleashed tear gas grenades in the room
4343700	4345700	and left everyone reeling and choking.
4345700	4348700	But would there be enough antidote for everyone?
4348700	4350700	Was there cover blown?
4350700	4353700	Do cyber eyes weep electric tears?
4353700	4355700	Would Harmon Town ever come to Finland?
4355700	4357700	Find out.
4357700	4359700	You see, because he's from Finland.
4359700	4363700	Next time on Harmon Town Shadow Time Run.
4363700	4365700	All right, yay.
4365700	4366700	Who is that by?
4366700	4368700	Who is that guest?
4369700	4371700	Who wrote that?
4371700	4372700	Teo from Finland.
4372700	4373700	All right.
4373700	4376700	I'll tell you one thing, it's straight.
4376700	4379700	Now, Malcolm, do you follow the show?
4379700	4381700	Do you know what's going on here?
4381700	4382700	Nope.
4382700	4383700	All right.
4383700	4386700	You're kind of like our eyes and ears.
4386700	4389700	I'm actually having trouble understanding.
4389700	4390700	It's fine.
4390700	4391700	Your language.
4391700	4392700	The words.
4395700	4397700	It might be Justin Marshall wearing a wig.
4397700	4398700	You understand?
4398700	4399700	It looks a lot like Justin Marshall.
4399700	4402700	I think he looks like Demetri Martin undercover.
4404700	4405700	All right.
4405700	4407700	Malcolm, follow your heart here.
4407700	4408700	So accurate.
4408700	4409700	I'm not in the room.
4409700	4410700	So what's going on?
4410700	4413700	You guys, except for Jeff, are in a hospital room.
4413700	4418700	There's a central table like in the ones I've been to.
4418700	4421700	And there's also tear gas fucking everywhere.
4421700	4424700	You're choking on the floor, except for Jim.
4424700	4425700	No.
4425700	4426700	Yeah.
4426700	4427700	Jim's been antidoteed by Dr. Friend.
4427700	4430700	The rest of you, tear gas is just full in the room.
4430700	4434700	There's a glass window leading to the exterior and the door.
4434700	4438700	I use my high composure to not succumb.
4438700	4440700	Well, you do.
4442700	4444700	It's tear gas.
4447700	4448700	You're confident.
4448700	4450700	My eyes are really dry.
4451700	4452700	No.
4452700	4456700	They're full of painful tears, in fact.
4457700	4459700	What tier or tier are we dealing with?
4459700	4460700	Like tier five?
4460700	4461700	Tier five tiers.
4461700	4462700	Tier six.
4462700	4466700	You got to do the instance with the PVPs.
4467700	4470700	I played World of Warcraft for like 20 minutes.
4473700	4475700	So we got two guards in here, right?
4475700	4476700	Yeah.
4476700	4477700	No, they're on the floor.
4477700	4481700	You knocked them out before getting antidoteed.
4481700	4482700	All right.
4482700	4484700	Is the tear gas still flowing in the room?
4484700	4486700	It's fucking everywhere.
4486700	4487700	You can't even see.
4487700	4490700	There's three tear gas grenades worth of tear gas.
4490700	4491700	Is there a window in the room?
4491700	4494700	Yeah, a glass one, which is rare.
4494700	4495700	Say what?
4495700	4496700	A glass window.
4496700	4497700	Okay.
4497700	4504700	I summon the spirit of the Native American wind eagle and summon a wind eagle to go up
4504700	4508700	there and flap the wings so hard that it burst the window and dissipates the tear gas
4508700	4509700	from the room.
4509700	4510700	To burst?
4510700	4512700	That's so flapping hard.
4512700	4515700	Well, the wind eagle is like 20 feet, like 20 feet wingspan.
4515700	4516700	It's a huge thing.
4516700	4517700	How big of a...
4517700	4519700	What force of a summoning is this?
4519700	4521700	I'm going to go for a force five, baby.
4521700	4523700	A force five?
4523700	4527700	I get under the nearest desk to protect myself.
4529700	4530700	You do that.
4531700	4537700	You find yourself well protected from a giant eagle who now exists in the room.
4537700	4540700	I'm also very composed.
4540700	4543700	Highly composed and full of tear gas.
4546700	4547700	There's an eagle.
4547700	4552700	It's got golden plumage and also different colored plumage because it's a spirit.
4552700	4553700	It's flapping around.
4553700	4555700	It's flapping up a storm.
4555700	4559700	But in so summoning, Jeff, what's your care?
4559700	4566700	Eve Libertine takes five fading damage or drain damage from the exertion of casting
4566700	4568700	a spell.
4568700	4573700	Combined with the three you've taken earlier, you're on the ropes here for consciousness.
4573700	4576700	You don't got too many spells left in your brains.
4576700	4577700	I'm pretty stunned right now.
4577700	4579700	I can't cast any more spells for a while.
4579700	4583700	May I please make a move?
4583700	4584700	Sure.
4584700	4594700	I would like to go outside the room and say to any nearby guards, hey, we got some tear
4594700	4595700	gas in here.
4596700	4597700	We've got a situation.
4597700	4598700	Get in here.
4598700	4600700	You guys like to party?
4600700	4601700	Come over here.
4601700	4604700	We've got a serious situation.
4604700	4605700	Okay.
4605700	4611700	Leaving the golden eagle behind, you exit C beta ward and you see a guard.
4611700	4613700	He's at the end of the hallway.
4613700	4615700	He's got a big rifle.
4615700	4616700	Hey.
4616700	4617700	Hey.
4617700	4619700	We need your help down here.
4619700	4620700	Oh, yeah.
4620700	4621700	I'm coming.
4621700	4622700	It's all fucked up.
4622700	4623700	What do you need?
4623700	4625700	I need you to walk in front of me.
4625700	4626700	Go into the room.
4626700	4627700	Why?
4627700	4628700	What's up?
4628700	4629700	The room's crazy.
4629700	4630700	It's a little crazy room.
4630700	4633700	No, that doesn't seem like any of my business.
4633700	4636700	Oh, so you're just going to hang out?
4636700	4637700	Yep.
4637700	4638700	I've got hallways.
4638700	4640700	I'll go back into the room then, but I'm telling you.
4640700	4642700	What are you telling me?
4642700	4644700	It's crazy?
4644700	4646700	Yeah.
4646700	4648700	Be more descriptive.
4648700	4652700	It's a terrorist attack.
4652700	4653700	Shit.
4653700	4656700	We should lock the hospital down then.
4656700	4657700	Yeah.
4657700	4658700	I'll follow you.
4658700	4660700	Okay.
4660700	4661700	Well, I don't need to go anywhere.
4661700	4663700	I'll just dial it in.
4663700	4664700	Okay.
4664700	4666700	Well, turn your back to me.
4666700	4667700	Okay.
4667700	4670700	He pulls out his comm link and turns away from me to dial the number.
4670700	4671700	I stun him.
4671700	4672700	I stun him.
4672700	4673700	I stun him.
4673700	4675700	I stun him.
4675700	4678700	All right.
4678700	4681700	You go to stun him and you hit him right in the temple.
4681700	4684700	Right in the temple.
4684700	4686700	The electricity flows through him.
4686700	4689700	You hear the smoldering of something fleshy.
4689700	4690700	Oh, no.
4690700	4692700	Or maybe not.
4692700	4696700	He drops to the floor and smoke exits his ears.
4696700	4698700	911.
4698700	4701700	It's not really a pun or anything.
4701700	4706700	Meanwhile, there's a large golden eagle chilling.
4706700	4707700	No.
4707700	4711700	He's flapping his wings to get the tear gas out of the room.
4711700	4712700	Oh, okay.
4712700	4713700	Wait.
4713700	4714700	Out of what?
4714700	4715700	Out of the room?
4715700	4717700	Out of the window that I was trying to burst.
4717700	4718700	Who?
4718700	4719700	I mean, how much wind?
4719700	4721700	I guess a lot of wind can burst a window.
4721700	4722700	Yeah.
4722700	4723700	All right.
4723700	4724700	That happens.
4724700	4725700	Oh, man.
4725700	4726700	I don't know.
4726700	4728700	Well, yeah, tornadoes and shit.
4728700	4730700	Yeah, and those guys' dicks are huge.
4730700	4731700	Sure.
4731700	4733700	Well, it's all yes and each other tonight.
4733700	4734700	No.
4734700	4737700	Well, I just, you know, I live in an earthquake area.
4737700	4738700	I'm not used to wind.
4738700	4739700	My dick is fine.
4739700	4741700	My dick is fine.
4741700	4742700	Yeah.
4742700	4745700	It doesn't need to be anything different than what it is.
4745700	4750700	My wife didn't do me a favor by marrying me.
4750700	4754700	She, if anything, she did herself a favor.
4755700	4758700	I think she did us all a favor.
4759700	4762700	Cliffhanger!
4764700	4766700	Oh, all right.
4766700	4768700	Favorite coming to Harvard 10, everybody.
4768700	4769700	Let's thank Nancy very much.
4769700	4770700	Malcolm, everybody.
4770700	4772700	Oh, no.
