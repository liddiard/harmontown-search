0	11800	From Hollywood, California, at one of the few remaining shows in Meltdown Comics, Harmon
11800	23000	City Town is now in session.
23000	34560	For your abject entertainment pleasure, Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
34560	60640	Spencer, stuck in the stage like an antelope, and the mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
60640	61640	What's this?
61640	62640	It's a cylinder.
62640	64640	It's a joint, okay.
64640	65640	Thank you.
65640	66640	What's written on the mic stand?
66640	67640	Is it funny?
67640	68640	It's a, no, I mean it's certainly, look, I don't want to judge whoever did this.
68640	69640	Is it you?
69640	77640	Well, the joint, I mean, I think we're even now, because I'm a slow reader, so the top
77640	79640	of the show was me, like, taking this all in.
79640	82640	Dear Deanna, I was hoping to ask you some time travel questions.
82640	83640	I know a bunch of your recent shows have been busy.
83640	84640	I would love a couple minutes to chat.
84640	85640	Sincerely, Michael.
85640	86640	And you meet on stage.
86640	87640	Like, if we have a moment, we'll have you up.
87640	88640	And we're just at my place.
88640	89640	Do you want to hang up?
89640	90640	I think it, uh...
90640	91640	But I do think, I do think...
91640	92640	Tavern on the Green in New York on Sunday afternoon.
92640	93640	But I do think, I mean, I think it's, uh, I don't know.
93640	94640	I don't know.
94640	95640	I don't know.
95640	96640	I don't know.
96640	97640	I don't know.
97640	98640	I don't know.
98640	99640	I don't know.
99640	100640	I don't know.
100640	101640	I don't know.
101640	102640	I don't know.
102640	103640	I don't know.
103640	104640	I don't know.
104640	105640	I don't know.
105640	106640	I don't know.
107640	108640	I want to hang up.
108640	109640	I don't know.
109640	110640	I don't know.
110640	111640	I don't know.
111640	112640	I don't know.
112640	113640	I don't know.
113640	114640	I don't know.
114640	115640	I don't know.
115640	116640	But I do think, I mean, I think you, I think given your goals, you played everything right
116640	119960	and gave me a joint and then, and then there was a note and it's like, you're letting me
119960	121520	have control of the relationship.
121520	122680	Thank you, Michael.
122680	124840	That's very nice.
124840	130280	Uh, so, so I'm a forgetful person, but, but I'll be looking at you for the next two hours
130280	133440	and maybe I'll, I'll, I'll remember.
134440	137440	Michael, the home, home brews beer, right?
137440	139440	I put all that beer in the fridge.
139440	141440	Uh, oh, I, okay.
141440	145440	Because I thought it just appeared from the, because you have time travel questions.
145440	146440	I don't know.
146440	147440	Whatever.
147440	149440	My mind was racing trying to figure out like if I knew a guy had time travel questions,
149440	155440	I could have done some prank where I like had a bucket fall on me, but then like planted
155440	156440	it.
156440	157440	I'm not sure.
157440	158440	I'm not good at practical jokes.
158440	159440	This is a terrible beginning to a show.
159440	160440	It's not your fault.
160440	161440	It's mine.
162440	163440	All right.
163440	166440	So, uh, thank you for coming, uh, uh, on your Sunday.
166440	169440	Uh, uh, I, uh, my name is Dan Harmon.
169440	171440	This is Jeff Davis.
173440	176440	Uh, we do a podcast called Harbontown.
176440	178440	A little thrown.
180440	182440	I, I, I, what's these glasses?
182440	184440	I too, it's like, am I really doing this?
184440	185440	Am I wearing these?
185440	186440	Yes.
186440	188440	Uh, I've been doing, I've been wearing them for the last couple days.
188440	189440	Well, I know, I think, you know, I look good.
189440	190440	Fine.
190440	191440	I look like Steve Bannon.
194440	197440	Did you know Steve Bannon sounds kind of like you?
197440	202440	You look at Steve Bannon and you, you look, you think he must sound like all these Jews,
202440	208440	but he sounds, but he sounds kind of like all these Jews.
211440	214440	He's like, I don't want to get off on a tangent here, but these Jews.
215440	217440	It's a weird, it was striking to hear.
217440	218440	I don't know.
218440	222440	I almost feel, I walked by a mirror today and I swear I was wearing a checkered shirt,
222440	227440	like Steve Bannon and I have the same fucking wardrobe, same, same amount of gray in the hair,
227440	231440	same length hair, same, like we're both, we're both pickling ourselves,
231440	238440	like both exploding into blood vessels and just like, like both just balls of fucking shit.
238440	243440	Um, and I, and I caught like in the peripheral vision, I walked by an unexpected mirror.
243440	246440	I didn't know it was a mirror and I swear my first thought was, Steve Bannon!
247440	252440	Like a weird, like that's how much like him I look if I wear a checkered shirt.
252440	257440	So I got out my Henley and I look like Tom Cruise again.
259440	262440	I, I, I, I, I, fuck.
265440	266440	Episode title.
267440	268440	It's just going to be one of those nights.
268440	272440	I, I, I, I just got back from Portland and-
273440	274440	Did you fly in today?
274440	279440	I flew back home today and then I had a four o'clock meeting about, um,
279440	284440	trying to get that movie made with the Michael Jackson and the chimp and, um,
284440	288440	with the Taika and the Waititi and the, um, uh, that like we're, we're,
288440	289440	we're trying to make that happen.
289440	294440	And, um, and so we had a Sunday, like drink session with power, power Hollywood,
294440	296440	trying to get that together.
296440	299440	And then I came back home and just, just enough time to just like, like,
299440	303440	joyless masturbate, like, uh, like just, just sad.
303440	305440	Just like, like, like, what was the, uh,
305440	307440	what was going on with the joyless masturbation?
307440	309440	Like, just frenetic, just frantic.
309440	311440	Like the pace was just like, like, it wasn't,
311440	313440	there was no like confident stroke there.
313440	314440	Is that what you want to know?
314440	315440	Is that what you're asking?
315440	318440	I want, I want you to tell us what the details are.
318440	322440	Do you guys ever think about, I mean, how many of you, uh,
322440	324440	cover the camera on your laptop?
325440	326440	Okay.
326440	330440	Let's say like 15, 20 strong, 30%.
330440	331440	Yeah.
331440	334440	Um, I, I, I, every once in a while I'll cover it.
334440	338440	If I will put like a breathe right strip on it from the night before.
338440	341440	But it's like, I go back and forth because I'm just like, I'm just like,
341440	344440	it's part of me is just like, yeah, choke on it, choke on it.
344440	349440	Like, like, yeah, watch me jerk off government.
349440	351440	Like, like, like, like watch every frame.
351440	355440	Like you never know, like put little like teasers in there.
355440	358440	So they have to watch all of me jerking off.
358440	361440	Let's go like, all right, let's do this one for ISIS.
361440	366440	Maybe we should do a very important phone call.
366440	367440	But first,
372440	375440	What if you like, like put decals in your cell,
375440	380440	like a NASCAR car with like, like Pepsi and firestone tires.
381440	382440	Well, I don't know.
383440	386440	And then you think like, well, what are they going to blackmail you?
386440	389440	Like, like, like that, that, that, that ship is sailed, right?
389440	392440	Like if you were an outspoken activist, let's say,
392440	396440	if you were like a modern day, uh, threat to the,
396440	399440	to the regime or something and you jerked off in front of your laptop,
399440	402440	what would they, would they release your jerk off?
402440	404440	Like, like your home, they wouldn't do it.
404440	406440	Would they send it to you in an envelope and go,
406440	409440	you look kind of silly when you jerk off.
409440	413440	So maybe black lives matter a little less than you think they should.
417440	418440	Um, right.
418440	420440	Um, and, and, and, but no one would be phased by that.
420440	421440	They'd be stoked, right?
421440	423440	They'd be like, like, like, okay, well, I do look silly.
423440	424440	That's for sure.
424440	427440	But, but like now I'm like martyred because they, yeah.
427440	430440	So I mean, I just, I mostly, we all,
430440	433440	we all text each other with a picture of you laying in your bed
433440	434440	with your balls out.
434440	435440	Like that's like, yeah.
435440	436440	Yeah.
436440	438440	I'm kind of, part of it is like, yeah.
438440	440440	It's like to take the enemy's ammunition away.
440440	441440	Exactly.
441440	442440	Like, look at my balls.
442440	443440	Look at my tiny dick.
443440	447440	Look at my gross hairy hedgehog body.
447440	449440	Look at my, look at my shoulder hair.
449440	451440	Like, listen to my horrible thoughts.
451440	453440	Like, like, I don't care.
453440	454440	I hate everybody.
454440	455440	I hate myself.
455440	457440	I hate the planet.
457440	458440	Nah.
458440	460440	Now I can say whatever I want.
460440	462440	Fuck the president.
462440	463440	I did it.
463440	465440	I won.
466440	468440	I don't know.
468440	470440	Well, anyways, I was importantly.
470440	473440	You think Trump listens to our podcast?
473440	474440	Oh yeah.
476440	479440	No, he's like notorious for his like, yeah,
479440	481440	he watches everything.
481440	483440	His radar dish is huge.
483440	484440	Yeah.
484440	487440	He's always, I think one of his most profound quotes
487440	490440	that you never hear quoted is he says,
490440	493440	you know, if you're not hearing your opposition's voice,
493440	495440	you might not be hearing yours.
497440	499440	He never said that.
500440	503440	Actually, that was said, I think,
503440	504440	or I'm not sure if it was said, bye,
504440	506440	but we're going to be talking about that.
506440	508440	We have a documentarian filmmaker.
508440	512440	That movie I kept talking about, accidental courtesy
512440	515440	that follows Darrell Davis around the guy
515440	517440	that shot that movie's here.
517440	519440	And this isn't me introducing him.
519440	520440	Yes, it is.
520440	521440	Let me introduce him.
521440	523440	My new friend Matt Ornstein.
540440	542440	Would you like a drink?
542440	545440	I'd be wide my own bee, but thank you so much.
545440	546440	Okay.
546440	547440	For the offer.
547440	548440	All right.
548440	552440	Just out of curiosity, how many people have seen this movie
552440	554440	just because I had mentioned it today?
554440	556440	All right. Okay, good.
556440	559440	Given the grosses, I find that hard to believe.
562440	563440	Let's start there.
563440	566440	What is the, how is the documentary racket these days?
566440	568440	I literally don't know where to keep the cash.
571440	573440	This was your first movie, right?
573440	576440	Like your first documentary, was it your first movie as well?
577440	580440	I've done a couple long-form documentary shorts,
580440	582440	one of which was a narrative hybrid.
582440	585440	So it was actors, but everyone else was a real person.
585440	587440	And that was about the last space shuttle launch.
587440	589440	And that did okay for itself.
589440	591440	So that kind of led to this, I guess.
591440	593440	Did you know that this was going to take about three years?
593440	597440	And if so, I have follow-up questions.
597440	600440	And if so, why was it worth it?
600440	601440	Go.
602440	604440	Well, I actually did not.
604440	605440	I did not.
605440	606440	I did not.
607440	611440	Matt, while Dan does that bit, for our listeners,
611440	614440	get the mic right in your lips, because it's, like,
614440	616440	you need to put the mic by the ice?
616440	617440	No, no, get it right there.
617440	618440	Oh, yeah, eat the mic.
618440	619440	Eat the mic right there.
619440	621440	I actually thought we could do it very quickly.
621440	624440	I was supposed to direct like a high school movie, actually,
624440	626440	like a good one, but a fairly normal movie.
626440	630440	And I cleared all that time, the pre-production, the shoot time,
630440	632440	and then it delayed.
632440	634440	And so I thought, oh, we'll just knock out the Daryl Davis thing.
635440	637440	So you thought maybe three months, six months?
637440	638440	Six months a year.
638440	639440	I thought it'd be cake.
639440	642440	Because that seems reasonable.
642440	646440	I mean, the movie opens with him telling a story that just sort of
646440	650440	whiplashes you because everything that you think you understand about
650440	655440	how bigotry and race is supposed to work in America is subverted by this
655440	662440	very simple story in the beginning, which is your throat sounds like it
663440	666440	might be a little tender, so I'll tell the story.
666440	671440	But he tells, there's the KKK's coming to town and they don't have a bus
671440	676440	and he has a bus and he gives them a, he lets them use his bus.
676440	678440	And you're kind of like, wait, what's going on?
678440	680440	I don't understand what's happening.
680440	687440	And it sort of leaves you hanging because it doesn't, you can't understand it.
687440	691440	This guy, Daryl Davis, like that's sort of how he started down this road
691440	699440	of this very unique individual form of activism where he very simply befriends
699440	705440	racists, not in an attempt to, he doesn't, you know, he doesn't come at them
705440	706440	and tell them how they're wrong.
706440	711440	He doesn't even say let's debate about, he just makes friends with them
711440	716440	and then slowly over time they tend to retire from racism.
716440	721440	I describe it like he fights a war of erosion or like, you know, it's like
721440	725440	the hundred years battle, like he knows eventually that it will work out
725440	728440	but it's not a hard sell by any means.
728440	732440	The opening you're talking about I love, I realized pretty quickly that we only had
732440	736440	one chance to sort of use, the cold open could be very special because you don't
736440	740440	necessarily know what his deal is and you immediately have to recontextualize
740440	744440	all this information right off the bat and then as the film goes on it sort of takes
744440	745440	on a different meaning.
745440	750440	Yeah, and then the meeting with the goddess as Joseph Campbell would put it,
750440	758440	like for me watching that documentary is that then he goes and he's in Baltimore
758440	759440	correct?
759440	760440	Baltimore.
760440	768440	And there's these very like smart like dedicated career activists, Kwame Rose and
768440	771440	Turek Toray, Kwame Rose and J.C. Falk.
771440	773440	Is J.C. Falk the older guy?
773440	774440	J.C. is the older guy.
774440	778440	And I had already described this scene to them which is that they sit down across
778440	781440	the table from this guy and you've been watching the whole time you've been watching
781440	785440	these kind of Jim Norton looking like KKK guys, I'm not Jim Norton's not racist
785440	789440	I'm just saying like they're just putting a picture in your head.
789440	790440	That's great casting.
790440	794440	That's one guy at the diner right, you'd cast Jim Norton as that guy.
794440	795440	Absolutely.
795440	799440	You're watching over and over again, you're watching him sit down with these guys
799440	802440	and you're kind of like it's again it's confounding because you don't understand
802440	807440	like well wait how is I don't understand how racism works then I don't if there's
807440	811440	exceptions to it then why don't you stop being racist and then sooner and then they
811440	815440	go well they eventually do they just need black friends.
815440	819440	I mean it's the reality though a lot of them have never had any black friends
819440	822440	and so in the absence of real information you can tell them they have horns and it
822440	823440	flies for a little bit.
823440	827440	And it becomes more of an expression of how much they care about their neighborhood
827440	832440	or their family or themselves or their whatever and there's this thing they've never
832440	837440	met and that that's the question that Daryl keeps asking that's his thesis question
837440	842440	is how can you hate me if you've never met me and it carries it through that but then
842440	848440	it's like oh now these times are upon us these conversations are so important
848440	856440	and he sits down with these guys these younger millennial activists and in very short time
856440	862440	they're they're they're having a harder time seeing eye to eye than these more performance
862440	867440	kind of like hey well baseball apple pie I'll tell you if you like Elvis then I like you
867440	872440	say cheese and I don't mean to I don't mean to demean it or trivialize it but it's like
872440	877440	now it's time to have a real conversation and it breaks down pretty quickly and he
877440	883440	and those guys don't it doesn't get like shouty but those guys get up and go you know
883440	887440	what can't do it anymore after they kind of call him out on what are you doing and
887440	891440	what is what good is it doing like like what has it changed you've been doing it so long
891440	896440	and isn't it almost thing that would kill me was when one of the two of them said it seems
896440	901440	like it's a fetish which is which is something everyone had thought at some point a little
901440	905440	bit because a fetish doesn't necessarily mean what he does isn't valuable it just means
905440	911440	that he has grown to he's fixated on it fixated on this thing and just a tiny bit of background
911440	924440	sorry I'm a little so he grew up in this sort of utopian school environment where there
924440	929440	really wasn't racism like we experience and take for granted here so he comes back to
929440	933440	the states and he does not it just does not compute and he wants to know what the deal
933440	937440	is and that's sort of what opens the door on all of this and it goes on to have you
937440	941440	know greater meaning for him and he's a musician right he's a musician he's played with Chuck
941440	945440	Berry and rest in peace and little Richard and all kinds of great musicians he's really
945440	950440	amazing at that and that's often his his way of communicating was initially through music
950440	954440	like you know he'd be playing somewhere and people would want to come talk to him so it makes him
954440	958440	a celebrity if you're in some little honky-tonk and you've been on Letterman with Chuck Berry
958440	962440	right and when you are that dedicated to music then probably you know you you that's another
962440	968440	reason why you you tend to not see the things that get us tied up not that it's not that I'm
968440	972440	a person that gets tied up in it but we should bring up our black friend Brandon Johnson that's
972440	986440	gonna black Brandon Johnson Brandon Johnson he's our blackest friend blackest friend in the
986440	998440	world I love that fucking theme song good god that's a good fucking suit Brandon you did it again
998440	1004440	thank you so much mr. Davis yeah you guys both look sharp Jeff Davis honestly just always
1004440	1012440	impeccable me I'm like I'm gonna cut a couch up and take the fabric off maybe rip out the
1012440	1018440	interior of a 78 Oldsmobile Cutlass and then wear that to the Harman town show well you
1018440	1029440	have a great tailor than thank you I mean I don't know dead worse nightmares the show is you and me
1029440	1036440	talking about suits I mean in his defense he did he said he knew what a Henley was though I'll give
1036440	1044440	him points for it's like Mike my girlfriend I heard my girlfriend say it's dope it's a big deal um
1044440	1051440	yeah close and what so what so one of the suits is better than the other suit but you disagree
1051440	1058440	on that I mean what we're just we're just admiring each other it's two men admiring the sartorial
1058440	1063440	splendor that is Brandon Johnson the gifting all right well anyway I just I just wanted to get him out
1063440	1069440	because I didn't want him like waiting around while we talked about this stuff but because Brandon's
1069440	1076440	like he's a he's a he's a he's the people love him he's the he's the very nice you damn Harman I really
1076440	1081440	I gotta say I love doing the show people have been so nice to me since I started doing it so thank everybody
1081440	1094440	so much for the nice words because it's difficult this is difficult soup to get into I thought it was
1094440	1104440	gonna be like Oprah easy animals and see some animals but no every week is some black shit
1104440	1119440	our show for you is the is the first two acts of get of get out I haven't seen it stop I mean I
1119440	1127440	didn't know I already know too much you know all right back back to this this scene in in this in this
1127440	1135440	cafe in Baltimore wherever it was so I read the short interview with you where you were talking about
1135440	1143440	the very understandable dilemma of this guy's been doing this his whole life what's the documentary
1143440	1148440	gonna be you thought it was six months now it's I don't know how long into that it is but it's like you're
1148440	1155440	you're you can't just make up a third act for a documentary it's like a hard thing to like paint a picture
1155440	1161440	and like have it also feel like a movie and we know he's not gonna like save a kitten from under a car
1161440	1168440	or like like you know punches dad or something but but then in this in this moment he's meeting these
1168440	1176440	you know activists who and it's like they're all good guys they're all heroes and they can't see eye to eye
1176440	1184440	and at one point one of the young guys says before he gets up from the table because he's he's talking about
1184440	1191440	how you know questioning what the efficacy of what Daryl's doing which also the guy from the southern
1191440	1196440	Poverty Law Center does as well he basically says we appreciate what you're doing in single portion
1196440	1203440	servings but we deal in bulk when it comes to anti-Semitism and racism we'd like to clear the fucking decks
1203440	1210440	we don't want to just spend 25 years making a few racist friends but but but that and that's the theme that these guys come upon
1210440	1218440	and it's like it's hard to it and it's hard it's it's hard to watch because it like removes all of your sense of
1218440	1226440	there's a solution here somewhere it's miss it's just in a box I haven't opened yet and I'm a I'm a fragile white privileged viewer
1226440	1232440	of this documentary I know the secrets to race and racism and I have I have I have numerous black friends
1232440	1240440	and I'm gonna like I'm gonna watch this and I'm gonna find out the truth but then it breaks down those guys get up
1240440	1247440	respectfully now we don't want to we don't really want to talk to you anymore and and at one point Daryl says
1247440	1254440	don't you guys think that do you guys not think that the system can change that these racists can change
1254440	1262440	and one of them kind of reflexively says no and that to me was like the meeting with the goddess where it was like oh shit
1262440	1271440	we're we're at war with ourselves because we're we're we're we're understandably like arguing between left and right black and
1271440	1276440	white and and and all this stuff and but there's this fight that we keep forgetting we're having which is the fight between people
1276440	1283440	that want to fight and people that don't want fighting to keep happening and I don't I'm not saying that activists are pro conflict
1283440	1290440	but they are it's the language they speak they're very they're they're they're dealing with the issue in that language they yeah
1290440	1298440	they're they're like arrest me because because if I'm afraid of getting arrested then you know then that's a fucking problem
1298440	1303440	and that's what you wanted so now I'm gonna make you arresting me part of the painting that I'm putting in this museum
1303440	1310440	and then it's like okay that's brilliant and good and effective but at what point do you go shit
1310440	1315440	what I don't know did you just walk away from this whole thing feeling like your soul wants to puke I mean
1316440	1320440	but in a good way that's called the catharsis if I had if I could put them on the box
1323440	1330440	I mean honestly I can I mean that's a various you read on it and I'm fond of saying about that scene that everyone in it is right
1330440	1335440	and everyone's also wrong they are correct the younger activists are correct that the stakes are different for them
1335440	1341440	they're watching their friends be killed in front of them and Daryl's solution is not something that seems immediate enough to them
1341440	1346440	but they're also wrong that people can't change which is hopefully kind of the big theme of the movie
1346440	1353440	I mean to make it murkier and even less satisfying for me what I've really come to through this movie is racism
1354440	1358440	racism is a social disease that is related to economics largely
1358440	1363440	I mean it's like it's horribly unfulfilling as that sounds
1363440	1369440	the factors that lead someone in an inner city to join a gang are the factors that lead someone in a rural area to join something like the clan
1369440	1373440	the same lack of education lack of options the same broken homes
1373440	1380440	and so when we get into that scene we're kind of butting up against that like the real issue here has to do with education opportunity
1380440	1386440	and a symptom is these you know KKK and skinhead guys
1386440	1392440	right because they're because their philosophies don't hold up if they sit down for a grilled cheese with a friendly black guy
1392440	1395440	they within five minutes are saying well I don't
1395440	1399440	and if that's all it took then like how how solid was your belief so
1399440	1403440	yeah and so then you go okay this is dumb and then you go okay there's a lot of dumb people
1403440	1408440	and then I know it's like like like like we a question that I want
1408440	1413440	I mean and anytime you can you can go look I made a documentary
1413440	1419440	I'm not talking about this shit but I was curious driving over here I was thinking about my thoughts on the issue
1419440	1427440	and I was like is there I guess circling around the question
1427440	1434440	like one one question to start with would be among white people is liberalism
1434440	1439440	it gets easier the richer you are right that's not to say that the richer you are as a white guy
1439440	1445440	the more prone you are to be liberal the statistics don't bear that out however show me a white liberal
1445440	1451440	and I'll show you a support system right I mean I think like most things it's probably easier to be wealthy and white
1451440	1461440	it's it's easier but it's I'm sorry Brandon you should totally check it out man
1461440	1468440	I was playing basketball and trying to get on America's Got Talent
1468440	1474440	but it really big I mean that takes you down a scary rabbit hole which is okay
1474440	1484440	so maybe I'm just not technically racist because my parents had a little less meth
1484440	1489440	like like like like I think I was born you know it's just like when you start to get it
1489440	1495440	those are the thoughts that really haunt you when you go like well okay so I had a neighbor with a swimming pool
1495440	1502440	and I had a 3.0 GPA and I lived in the suburb and I you know we weren't there were there were no bars on our windows
1502440	1510440	so and I had I went to integrated schools and so but it was like I guess I guess the thing I'm circling here is like
1510440	1517440	so we have this the big problem that we have in our country is neither race nor is it bigotry nor is it
1517440	1523440	it's it's it's the fact that we refuse to address class we refuse to address poverty
1523440	1530440	and that where there is poverty there are things like that don't affect us as much like people believing the earth is flat
1530440	1538440	people believing that there's no Sun that it gets eaten by a turtle at night like those things just don't affect how they hire and fire
1538440	1545440	and who they shoot and like what what words they say on Larry King like like like I don't know they're mixing a lot of things there
1545440	1550440	you're like why would there be a poor white person on Larry King that believes turtles eat the Sun
1550440	1554440	well they're they're they're clearly there because they're a Trump science advisor
1555440	1560440	because it's hard to find yeah they're gonna find that they're gonna have equal time
1560440	1565440	yeah so I don't know what I don't have a question I was just babbling about it
1565440	1571440	nobody you're you're battling in the right direction it really is you told you fucking
1571440	1578440	I heard you fucking doubting me because we were honky pieces of shit
1578440	1586440	you tell them because we refuse to talk about class in a realistic way we leave the door open for people like Trump to talk about it in a way to their advantage
1586440	1594440	right you know poor black people and poor white people have a lot more in common than rich white people and poor white people at the end of the day
1594440	1605440	but like the color of their skin I don't understand I'm kidding yeah you know it's this is the age old thing we all know it too like even the dumb people know it but they don't feel it
1605440	1612440	well you do this thing collateral damage where you're like we're gonna lose a hundred thousand people but we're gonna advance 20 million
1612440	1623440	so you'll do things like you'll create a nice thin poor white line next to a large black community and then you'll keep super rich people further away
1623440	1630440	it's so fucking primitive if you look in Los Angeles all the rich people live up high
1630440	1643440	it's the most monkey shit that we do and you want to say like when are we gonna finally do this but there's something about the human race that we're like
1643440	1648440	man we got these places where we take people that get sick and we just put them in this place man it's called a hospital
1648440	1655440	we devote four of those floors to titty titty augmentation and then one Florida cancer research
1655440	1668440	I think the same is with race is that we are we're super trying to figure it out still racism is kind of complex but it's really not that complex but it works it works without a head so it's difficult to stop it correct
1668440	1681440	I think that is absolutely true but I will also better man I didn't just I didn't just rip off Jesse Jackson for nothing
1681440	1688440	you are so aggressive but also so articulate I love it
1688440	1692440	it's so articulate
1692440	1703440	you know I do think on some level it does seem like something that will not be with us forever and I know that sounds very optimistic but if you look at it by age distribution
1704440	1707440	Michael stop it
1707440	1719440	obviously the internet is in many ways a dark and terrifying thing but it also the amount of empathy it generates you know that they say that overnight with the invention of the Gutenberg printing press the murder rate in the world went down
1719440	1726440	because you could suddenly understand what it was like to be someone else and the internet is that times a million just not in the YouTube comments
1726440	1746440	technology advances and then that parabolic curve like information grows so fast I think what they call that thing we're going to have the computing power of a human brain in our phone like four weeks from now because that's the rate things are going up
1746440	1757440	but it's racism or sexism actually moving at a similar rate I don't think it is I feel like I feel like I'll handle this
1757440	1760440	I almost feel like everybody take five
1760440	1768440	it almost seems like I think is that Turing's is that is that inaccurate to call it Turing's curve or whatever you're talking about
1769440	1789440	Turing's thing is that one day the computers will be more more so in this room knows Moore's law there okay got it all right so I didn't hear it but let's but but it almost seems like that's going to outpace like it's like I have had conversations lately where it's almost like we're starting to admit to ourselves that we
1790440	1807440	short of ripping our flesh off of our faces and and throw gender in there as well like we can't we're we're just fucking idiots about it like we receive signals that overpower us and the progressive among us are simply
1808440	1828440	compensating and things that we always have these bio engineered for fucking barbarism bodies and that we're quickly approaching the point where there will be an app that just makes you not racist because it'll and it won't be because we become evolved I thought that was Pornhub
1828440	1847440	I can't hate those people so fucking beautiful it looks good in them swirls that's two that's two or more colors in a rolling ball of fuck
1847440	1867440	you know statistically there's truth to that as well like eventually it really is it's all blending and the numbers are changing and the demographics are changing and like the day when a non-college educated white man could run it all is definitely the sun is setting on that and that's part of what you're seeing is the last stand
1867440	1897440	it's the spasms because it's like because it actually is we talk often about oh a guy in Kentucky doesn't have any Muslim friends or whatever well yes and no I think what's happening is that it's it there's this Rubicon being crossed this this this where yeah but thanks to the internet this that person in Kentucky feels like it's at his doorstep now he in a way that he never felt it before and there was actually a kind of like strange like symbiosis between the
1897440	1927440	heartland and the cities before there was always possible when they were separated by horse distance and it was like oh my cousin's coming to town he's a little bit of a hillbilly I mean you know there's been there's been studies for I think 15 years now about the level of mistrust of people in the middle of the country of the coasts and all the media related yeah it's been there we just kind of yeah David Wong wrote this really great essay kind of summing that up in terms of our popular culture it was just
1927440	1957440	it just all goes back to this whole thing that's you know hunger games and all that stuff it's like we in America in particular we love the mythology of people in the country are simple folk they like to chew on their long grass things and and they're awful clever they're like leprechauns they got they got salt of the earth wisdom and they got tricks they can pull and they're they're the heart of the whole country and then meanwhile in the cities and we're in the cities propagate this myth we look at ourselves
1957440	1987440	as not city folk we look at ourselves as country folk that move to the city and and so we write movies and TV shows about how well if you live in the city you're this out of touch pasty faced person with a mole sticker on your face and the heart shaped hair and you're like oh what with this next contestant will fight the laser shock for food I love it and and we understand that that is the that's this that
1987440	2017440	has been it's the outlaw hero versus the righteous hero it's the idea of cities coming up and like oh the sheriff's important but so is the Han Solo guy mixing genres I'm still following it it so I guess that's just me going oh I know what you're talking about I can say it too but longer I think that I think that it's like it's obviously a cynical writing device but it's also hopeful that maybe like if we threw off
2017440	2047440	the shackles of the city we'd be better more honest man straightforward people Matt could you make a documentary about Dan Harmon called mixed metaphors I have some availability but it does feel like is there is there a chance that actually just because city living is getting more and more of a you know like we're the money's thinning out the millennial generation is they're getting by on less
2047440	2077440	rich they are richer there is more money privately now because people got super rich in the past 10 years so that's who's buying houses in San Francisco in Los Angeles and Chicago millennials that's why yeah those pieces of shit yes because I never trusted them Dan they're all around us play it cool Jackson all I gotta do is put out some records I think millennials have just been pretending to live with their
2077440	2107440	parents and not have a future they also they also love racist stuff they'd love it they pretend to get outraged by stuff but they tell me more please like all of our crowd millennials they come to the show what are they doing like you guys you get so afraid of us saying the wrong thing but you keep coming every week we're going to offend you every time well I think I would they're not here to defend
2107440	2137440	themselves but I would say that's because it's like it's not like NASCAR where you're like I hope I see a car flip over and have a disaster I think it's more like if if in NASCAR a car flipping over made the car stronger like if a burning Dan Harmon crawled out of every wreck and went like now I'm made of asbestos and I'll handle those curves a little slower I would watch that they do I mean I think I'm America's like Gen X
2137440	2167440	like like unintentionally racist and sexist white knight uncle that like it's like because I didn't get married when I was I did get married that's right I think because I didn't get married and have kids on the memory now have me have a 20 year old kid like I'm just like this weird drunk Gary Busey uncle at their wedding you know going like oh you kids talking about race there's the thing you got your black people
2167440	2197440	you're white people is that still a thing think about it spiritually uncle Gary Busey that was a fucking wicked Gary Busey impression you don't know you have one until you try it Gary Busey I lost it I lost it very familiar feeling starting to come over me I think even he has trouble these days keeping it in but anyways yeah I
2197440	2227440	think the Twitter's become a sewer it just upsets me I can't get off of it I can't I have this like but I also get these like doses of like pure like uplifting optimism and I guess it's just I'm 44 so I'm always gonna funnel it through race and gender and all this stuff but I was like I'll see like it's it's black women black young women are going to save us because they haven't like
2227440	2257200	on Twitter they're like they I'm like I'm dehumanizing by putting them in a group or something if you know a black woman and she's a piece of shit that's that's good good good I'm not I'm not dehumanizing anybody I'm just saying like I see this face of the future and it's like oh this all makes sense because they just they've just been had so many times but they it's it's it's forced that demographic to keep this thing that we're all striving for which is like big picture like pragmatism
2257200	2287040	because there ain't no fucking like jackpot coming if you play your cards right like like it's it's more like wait a minute what how does the house always win and and and how do you count cards and that's what I'm seeing a lot on Twitter and blogs and things easily is is is people that you would never the silhouette they cut you'd think well this person wouldn't even show up to the conversation because there's so many buttons being pushed before they get in the room well it's the opposite no my buttons are getting pushed
2287200	2287840	because my software and hardware are all out of date and now there's this new generation of people who are just like born into this stuff and going like man there's a lot of fucking claptrap going on about my race and my gender but I'm not going to let that distract me it's I see you're trying to trigger me but here's the thing and and and I see a lot of of that going on I like I what is my fucking point am I trying to get a medal for I want a young black woman to come up to me after the show and give me a teddy
2317200	2347200	I guess shut up and if that is you let's not forget Maxine Waters has been super brave and old black women and that's the thing is that for us Dan why do they have to be young it started it probably you know that's years and years of activism and yeah that is trained and and you grow up knowing these things and and it's great because you you are able to pass a little hope I'm glad you're so inspired this is a part of the public school kid from the
2347200	2377200	Milwaukee so I guess whenever I did that when Maxine Waters like responded or more importantly didn't respond didn't take the bait of all that like that man is he did she did she was like that man it has a bunch of cases against him for women's it was beautiful so it's like you don't fuck with her in the first place you know you got all filthy ass hands Riley that was the crazy I was like why would this do pick on her when he knows that she is not going to fuck around on the
2377200	2407200	bottle she's she's a black woman she's going to tell you that your feet stink the pizzas burnt and I don't think that bathroom is clean enough I was excited when and I love you I'm telling you these things cuz I love you and I don't want your friends to come over taste your nasty ass pizza and take a shit in your shitty bathroom yeah I loved you that was miss miss Jackson my fourth grade math teacher calling me over to the desk after taking everybody's lunch money and then calling me back up
2407200	2437200	Daniel and she handed me a brush and a nail file it's like go scrub your hands and wash your nails wash your hands and scrub your nails and I was like I turned beet red was like what she's like go wash your hands and scrub your nails anyways Dan I tweet you that every every couple days the max the Maxine Waters like I noticed like she didn't it was like it's like how old is she what is she 70 she's Donald
2437200	2467200	Trump's age right 12 terms or something like that I'm gonna talk about a black woman's age she's 42 below Riley made that comment and it was like and then let's all have like these logical debates about oh you can talk about his hair oh shit give me a break you're supposed to understand the shit with your gut not that's why I'm the wisest you're not supposed to process the shit with your fucking if you're having a debate on Twitter about like what
2467200	2497200	so you can make fun of his hair it's like think lower in your body about this and what you know that Bill O'Reilly meant when he responded to her saying the president's a criminal by going like her hair looks like dreams round like it I mean think if you don't know that that's racist then it's like the we don't need to have a debate customers always right it's it's all it's all dogwessel to like somebody Bill O'Reilly who's a professional piece of shit has
2497200	2527200	these these viewers that know their way of life is on is waning they're selling feel better for 10 minutes like what Obama the eight years they were addicted like Bill O'Reilly could just get on and dog whistle very lightly about race so they're well the president in Jive was exactly just like that wasn't a very subtle dog whistle I'm not good at it because I don't see the world through that lens I saw commander and Jive was at the summit today
2527200	2557200	but but but it was like it was for eight years the mythology that was selling was you're poor you're at home you're watching TV your problems aren't getting solved there's a black president it was an easy dot it was like having a wicked stepmother like and and then okay let's now the big story is let's have an election and that was fun too and then it was like the hope and change night that the next day it felt like we all just started making paper airplanes and hanging
2557200	2587200	out like and then there was a lot of like tea party mess around but like this is different because it's like they won and then they're like and I'm still mad of course about what mad about you not accepting my anger I mean I don't accept your anger because you won well yeah yeah it's no flake yeah they're amped up oh yeah so when he sees he knew he's like I'm gonna say something a little itty bitty racisty and it's gonna
2587200	2617200	we're gonna have a conversation about here and we've all seen how many videos have we seen of someone in a store being horrible and the punchline for them is this is why I voted for Trump like I've seen I can't stop watching these things honestly stop me please Matt did did those people that he helped to change is there a number on that that number goes up and down it's sort of like a fishing story it's hard to it's hard to clock you know two dozen 40 some article had it at 200 which I think is way high did they go on
2617200	2647200	to do his work like did they recruit you know some some of them do the guy who's at the end of the movie Scott Shepherd who was a grand dragon and now as sort of an activist he texts me like you know that he's working on this guy this other guy I mean it's it's it's definitely propagating itself on some level is it yeah one like really do yeah like how many of them make friends with him and I'm asking for more data that you're gonna say is like up and down but but but like that's another question is like do they make friends with
2647200	2677200	him and then 30 years later go my back hurts I can't be racist anymore here take my grand wizard cloak like does that count I mean I think it all counts but like some of it is that I think that I would analogize it's like being in a crime family like you know all of your your kids friends parents are also part of it if you're a grand dragon you get paid dues I mean it's part of your financial structure it really has to uproot your life to change it yeah but then you can get a job as a grand
2677200	2706660	supplement your income for sure that's it Brandon Brandon Brandon oh look not everybody can get a job as well but there's a loophole I'm from Hollywood well the one in the movie in the purple robe has been has been murdered since the film so there is at least one vacancy do you think that was politically motivated was he murdered for it was apparently his
2707500	2736540	his wife who he was leaving in her biological son Missouri and he died on the same day as Prince which is fucked up yeah they poisoned him so he'd be docile and then shot him for good measure is my understanding of it whoa okay he was absolutely very thorough oh god yeah and I will say one thing to myself in response to that comment about like oh do they just get old and they're too old to be racist but if
2736540	2766540	from my experience not to say that my family has any old racists in it but but like from my experience you if you don't getting older makes you more spiritual it doesn't tend to make you more progressive like it you know it's not just something to do because you're old like I find myself a little more God-fearing every pound I gain and every time I get in the elliptical I just
2766540	2796540	like genuflect a little bit but but but and there's that kind of thing no atheists in a foxhole and what is life but God is at war with us it's killing us and we tend to anyways but but you don't you don't you kind of double down that's my experience is like you go to your grave without intervention going like I'm dying and by the way I'm so glad there's no black people in my room that I'm dying in because they'd probably steal
2796540	2826540	my death even the death yeah you know I have a new project I'm working on that sort of links into this and a factor that all these countries where they have populist regimes that come to power an aging population is like the number one factor people are more afraid they want to hold on to what they have they're more willing to listen to convenient lies everything young is like I mean these guys give me a break the things that they say and tweet
2826540	2856540	like I'm starting to get like I'm like I shake my cane at them all the time every ever everything young to the older you get it's like a threat it was Steve Martin made that hilarious joke when he hosted the Oscars like I love to introduce the young filmmakers god damn I can't tell a fucking joke to save my life I always I always love to meet the young filmmakers in Hollywood because they remind me of my death something like that but it's I mean that's it in a nutshell is like
2856540	2886540	hey your old young people seem a little bit like poison ivy to you sure like like they just feel icky like they feel like they're pushing you off the earth I tried look I tried to do the same shit when I was your age bring it we deserve it we ain't doing shit with the earth anyway come on young people y'all can have this motherfucker man it's all polluted and shit I can't smoke inside anymore you can fucking have it
2886540	2916540	Brandon and I were having a conversation about this at the airport lounge we went to Chicago and we were talking about you kind of boiled it down to well we have a biological panic inside of us because we're descended and some of us are descended from areas where if you had an orange in your hand made the difference between whether your kids could live or die and we're like we're kind of biologically reacting to that I
2916540	2946540	could be this is this is paranoid but there's a little there's this crazy thing where you're like if you look at the world you notice that the population of white people is like way up high in the hills it's like Canada United States and then over Africa and India and shit there's like white people but all the good shit is close to the equator it's where all the oranges and the fruit and like the the life and the dance and the fucking carnival but naked beautiful black women are
2946540	2976540	dancing in the streets and it's crazy so if you lived up there in those places that are closer to the cold and you heard that there was a world that was warm and it was it was there's a lot of fruit and there was there was not as much disease potentially you would know you can keep your orange thank you I swear to God this motherfucker heckled me with fruit but I think if you say a noun he produces it he's
2976540	3006540	too pussy I think that the world I think the world would look different to you because you're from a place where maybe it's barren so you see these people down there and you're like they're not actively managing their resources we're starving how can we get their shit and if you look at it on a map it looks like the people who live up here who don't have food and warmth are coming down to get the shit in South America and Africa so what our thing is is to sort of say welcome
3006540	3036540	there's enough food for all of us come on down here but we've been waiting for you we're not worried about dying out but if you live up in these places you come from these places you're like fuck my numbers are decreasing I can't have the United States become Mexican and black and Asian I followed a mammoth down here right I busted my ass and and I have I don't have a lot of fucking resources when it comes to things that keep me healthy so I can negotiate with these people and try and get the shit that they have hot peppers and red fruits and orange fruits and
3036540	3066540	yellow fruits or I can just swoop down and take that shit if my numbers were failing if black people were becoming extinct I might try to steal all your fucking oil I might try to take all your land I don't know if you believe that you're in that you're part of a genocide if you feel like your people are dying out which is kind of how the thickest of the racists feel they feel like abortion is bad because you're fucking up our numbers not because we don't believe in a
3066540	3096540	right to choose or that bullshit is nothing to do with that they're like you are fucking with our sheer numbers it's a billion Chinese we got to catch up your Italian families your Irish families ain't doing your jobs but if you think like that then yeah it does make sense that this tribe would be warrior like but our job is to beat you to the punch and sort of be like hey man there's enough shit for everybody stick around I'm invested in your survival just like I want you to be invested in mine I like I like that I like that model the best because it
3096540	3126540	acknowledges this thing that like nags at me when I look at the world and I just feel like empirically you could just observe the fact that there's one accurate thing you could say about genetics it's that white people are so good at racism like like they're just gifted at it and and I just like I don't want to believe that that's genetic but but at the same time if you go purely egalitarian and go like well we're all exactly the same
3126540	3156540	then you are this then you you have to be subjected to this world that keeps telling you you're wrong about your your decidedly rational belief that everything's flattened even and and the nice different split is like maybe there's a couple millennia of like what my therapist would call kind of like tribal memory and shit like there's like there's it's not really genetic as much as it is like kind of just I don't know it's like some other field of storage and that that will burn out
3156540	3186540	um yes there's nothing you often hear too though you know when you're used to things being completely disproportionate equality feels like you're losing and I think there there is a fair we've all had those moments like where if you ever like take like I don't know you're at a party and somebody says hey we should all get high and just hang out and like and then like I don't know something weird happens like like somebody says what if we all uh got pizza and like took off all our clothes and
3186540	3216540	put it in a bucket um and you're like 23 and you're like I've never done this drug before and pizza sounds good and I just moved here from Portland and I don't even like these clothes and everyone's taking them off and then we all have these like moments like like these random social experiments where somehow there's like sometimes you like fight this roller coaster ride where you take off all your clothes you put it in the bucket with everyone else's clothes the pizza comes someone else is in the bathroom and uh you run
3216540	3246540	your credit card for the pizza but you're all high and it's all like and then there's this moment where you have these like as much as you were into the whole clothes in the bucket and everything it's equal you have this paranoid flash of oh my god I'm being fucked over like everyone here hates me I'm a dork they're laughing at me that's why they all have beautiful bodies that's why they want their clothes in the bucket I was like they wanted to look at I look like Paul Giamatti and I'm now I'm buying all their food and they're fucking each other in the bathroom and they probably have more drugs that they're not sharing with me
3246540	3276540	and you just start to lose your mind that that's not a story that actually happened to me there's no such thing as a that that's that's so specific it has to be autobiographical there's a lot of detail in there and where was the where was the clothes bucket party well you know what come to I mean actually how big is the bucket all the clothes could fit in one bucket I stitched some elements together there there was a girl I went out with once
3276540	3306540	the underwear party no no we would never put our clothes in a bucket brand I briefly went out with a girl once who was like into yoga and she was she was she was very attractive and and I was lonely and I but she was also really nice and like open and like emotionally
3306540	3336540	and I you know we'd go to dinner and I'd go like well I feel like sometimes I grapple with this I feel like if you have good luck on Monday then you're gonna get cancer on Tuesday and she'd go like have you ever experimented with maybe just having gratitude for what you have gratitude huh I like it I like it huh gratitude and I and I you know and we'd go to the beach and she'd you're like I like that you don't want to go in the ocean and do yoga I'm gonna do some yoga is that okay
3336540	3366540	yeah everybody does whatever they want that's what's great man and she'd do like yoga everything's going great and then I just you know a couple dates we went to a party together and then it was like she all her friends that grew up in her neighborhood were at the party and they all had gone to the same high school or whatever their version of high school was like some Academy or something it was like Allison and they and I was like oh they're all rich and like and then they were like and then somebody brought over a
3366540	3396540	box of underwear and they all were like dancing and I was like yeah dancing to it at weddings but I like getting high I'll sit here and get high and then I was the only one sitting and getting high and then everyone was dancing and then somebody brought over a box of underwear and they're all like let's all put on the underwear not over our clothes that's not how you wear it they all took off their clothes so they all look like Ken and Barbie dolls and they were all rich and they're all sexy and they all did yoga and I was a fat guy sitting on the balcony with a joint in my mouth and I was just like fuck all these people fuck them
3396540	3426540	they fucking lied to me they tricked me it's just like fucking grade school it's just like everything they would laugh at the fat guy what if I oh if I choose I'm so fat I can't dance what are you doing this isn't a custom get everyone put on under who brought a box of underwear I was wondering about that you should have got negative fucked them up you should have put that belly on them my point is that it's it's at those junctures when you
3426540	3456540	start to risk melding with people that you're at the height and you should be it's that it's that weird thing of like a Ouija board or a or like some game you'd play at a party where you're like okay so you know we're gonna reach out I'm gonna we're both gonna do this thing or like I far the other stiff as a board thing I'm gonna fall back at everyone catch me it's like just that thought that gets in your head of like boy this could all be leading up to them them just letting me hit the floor and wouldn't that be a gas
3456540	3486540	for them and you hear stories where that's that's happened to some people in this room you were at a sleepover and you played the game where you trust fall and someone it was like either a mistake or it was actual fucking targeting you hit the fucking floor and you I mean you probably don't even know how traumatic it was you probably think that that you probably tell that story to your friends and go and that and that's what I was like I knew that was gonna happen and I'm more into Linux than and these people just are gonna keep on it
3486540	3516540	debating between Mac and PC and I'm like off the grid and but but but what really it's like and but you're always gonna be dealing with I can't believe they fucking did that to me it really hurt me inside and out anyways but it's like that yeah racism I mean just to just to bring it back around you know isolated isolated people are who who falls for this stuff in general that's the common theme these people that
3516540	3546540	are isolated geographically and personally and they find belonging through through these ideas prisoners dilemma yeah so cops do they separate you they come into your room and they say your buddy says you're a fuckup you did you rob the bank that you've been isolation makes you manipulatable exactly right and so now we have this internet and it's like now we're at this age that none of us could predict it's like how do we have an internet and the historical headline of this era of political history is
3546540	3576540	fake news the idea that and it's not just the idea that Breitbart is fake news or that Breitbart calls Emma's NBC fake news it's the idea that we can believe that there we've never been more polarized in terms of the information that we're receiving how is that that's no one would have predicted that the internet would have caused that but it makes sense because it's a trust fall exercise and we're in a spasm of are you gonna fucking drop me what happened is there over my head or something what
3576540	3606540	where is the spider yeah all right this I thought it was on my head she reached up with a beer can and put a spider in and then just fucking like like grab the spider with a beer can right which means she brought it in I thought I should have given him an orange but you reached up behind Michael you don't realize she
3606540	3623100	put this dr. pepper don't give it a spider she put this dr. pepper can above your head and caught a spider that was about to land on your hands and saved your life I mean let's give her what's your
3623100	3651920	name madam what's your name Madison Madison come on stage just just so we have a woman on stage for once in our lives I think I know Michael's first time travel question it's did this Madison bitch come back in time to ruin my life with all the spider maps
3652900	3674100	get that spider can't brandy just drink the spider he just drank the spider I mean that brought back a lot of the themes taking care of each other and about women doing the heavy lifting so Madison Madison described the spider and his descent over Michael's head
3674100	3699120	well it was really small and translucent and it was going down and then it went back up and down and how many times would you say it went up and down it's Madison maybe four amazing Jeff but but like like a ninja you use dr. pepper an empty dr.
3699120	3718940	pepper can to just harvest it like amazing was that your first time no it appears you've gone with a passive ombre how do you feel about that it's gorgeous how long how long had you been thinking about that
3718940	3739340	Madison this is the first time I've ever seen Brandon Johnson nervous he's fucking he's losing his cool right now he's losing his cool he just saw a woman save a dude from a spider attack and now he's it's a little ill at ease will you beat up my sister
3739340	3765260	can I call you Madison Madison do you live in Los Angeles yes
3769340	3798420	there was a reaction I know that guy's on a ledge but I'm gonna ask a follow-up question I hope he's cool with it are you going to school me yeah okay Madison I get the mic right up to your mouth we have a hard
3798420	3804660	time I'm not in school anymore where did you go to school what did you study
3804660	3827820	oh wow so you're are you a Jesuit I am NOT a Jesuit but that's a Jesuit University I went to a Jesuit University I dropped out of freshman year I was a journalism major can't really be a major in your freshman year took the same
3827820	3847340	classes everyone else fancied myself a journalist what so so you were in Chicago so you're how long you've been out of school you just came out to LA to apply your dream trade no I've been here for four years and I graduated in 2011 all
3847340	3867500	right so what's the dream trade I moved here for screenwriting but now I'm working at a VR company as an art director seems like a good move Justin Justin Roylan the creator Rick and Morty is it's 9-11
3867500	3892900	he's really into VR there's like like he's like I mean he's like it seems dumb to say he's convinced it's the future it probably is he's speaking at that things yeah I work for them yeah yeah I work for the conference it's
3893500	3904020	Justin's just speaking there but I work for them nobody gonna fuck with you Madison
3904020	3914020	what aspect of VR are you as specializing in like as a writer like like like oh I
3914020	3919180	have an idea for a VR story or game or something like that not like coding and
3919180	3924140	like so what do you think what have you noticed as a writer going into VR
3924140	3928900	because I look at it and I just go like oh shit we're in trouble like because it
3928900	3932740	kind of defies the whole three-act structure and things not well maybe not
3932740	3936140	that but in the sense of like it seems like writing is gonna become more bulk
3936140	3941260	why might I ask you I'm what have you noticed what am I why do I always have to
3941260	3947060	be such a smarty pants I think it'll just develop a new form of storytelling
3947060	3952180	and it'll be a way to make things seem to create a totally new reality do you
3952180	3955380	think though that so then the right what is the writers job become if we're
3955380	3958500	creative the new form of storytelling is that someone puts on a helmet or a pair
3958500	3964460	hopefully something lighter and wireless the they put these things on and then
3964460	3969300	they're in a different world so the things that someone has written they
3969300	3975460	need to be even more so than we've seen in video games like the writers can no
3975460	3979260	longer just control what happens when writers need to actually just fill
3979260	3984300	barrels of information about characters and things so all right I guess I am a
3984300	3988260	smarty pants but is that are you looking forward to that do you think that's more
3988260	3994060	fun I think it's really exciting I think that it'll open up storytelling to a lot
3994060	3998140	of different people that wouldn't normally have a voice in it yeah and I
3998140	4001300	think that people are sort of programmed to answer in certain ways like when you
4001300	4005260	go to a grocery store it's like how much is this right you know whatever the you
4005260	4008820	have almost like a script already so when you program things to be that way
4008820	4015100	then you can kind of tailor reactions based on a more it's like a reality so
4015100	4018540	it's like if you make it you if you make certain rules for the world that you're
4018540	4023260	in then you can create a totally new reality based off of these scripts that
4023260	4028180	we already have so if I'm watching like fast and the furious what is it 10 20
4028180	4034260	now it's 25 so is there a way is there a way I could just like hang out with
4034260	4043500	Vin Diesel's butt the whole movie that's a thing it would be amazing is like
4043500	4047780	crowdsourcing writing so that like you watch you have like your point of
4047780	4051860	departure is actually a movie that's on rails an experience that's on rails and
4051860	4056500	then but then then people keep building it outward as if it's a town they could
4056500	4060340	it's like like the way that old Western towns are built they you went from the
4060340	4069780	saloon to the horse store I don't know and then it built out now now now
4069780	4074340	that would be interesting that it's like oh you put on this helmet and you
4074340	4079780	experience like oh this this guy got caught cheating by his wife and they're
4079780	4082300	having this conversation this cocktail party and so you experience the whole
4082300	4085780	thing but then or like or even I was like Vin Diesel and the Rock are gonna
4085780	4089580	steal cars for the government okay well then you do it but then that idea that
4089580	4095940	like oh okay a team of writers that knew that someone was gonna say I'm gonna
4095940	4100820	stay here with Vin Diesel's butt and that and that that was as exciting to a
4100820	4104820	curative type of writer who was like like because we see that in fan fiction
4104820	4109220	like like there's like there's a writer for every crevice you know like this
4109220	4118340	so it's almost like shake that man's hands so that you end up going into
4118340	4123420	these experiences and fast to the furious 35,000 is actually the virtual
4123420	4127300	experience is more of a sandbox like well there's this thing that goes on
4127300	4131860	where Vin Diesel and the Rock steal some cars but but people talk about stories
4131860	4135340	as if they're real life there's no distinction they say because that's how
4135340	4139980	our life isn't real anymore we say hey if you oh are you a foodie have you
4139980	4145220	eaten at a cabbage and dicks they bring a cabbage and a dick and it's like
4145220	4149700	it's an antelope penis but it's like it's it's filled with antioxidants and
4149700	4151940	then they bring this butter and they make it by the table and you have to
4151940	4155020	make your own butter and if your butter is better than theirs you can put it on
4155020	4159340	the dick it's like none of it's real like it's not like it's like meanwhile in
4159340	4165260	Lebanon I don't know but but but like so we're given we're capable of
4165260	4168740	experiencing an entire artificial world so we would actually end up saying to
4168740	4172220	each other I would be not in a real room I'd be talking to you guys and then we'd
4172220	4176860	say hey if you guys have you guys been to if you just watched fast to the
4176860	4181100	furious but then hung out and Vin Diesel's ass crack it's amazing cuz at
4181100	4187260	midnight Duncan Trussell comes in and he's been doing this improv show where
4187260	4190940	he's a character that steals a car out of his ass crack and the way we're
4190940	4194780	doing this hacking thing I don't know it would be cool to see people get
4194780	4198860	different awards for different storylines so like you'd get an Academy
4198860	4204220	Award for the Vin Diesel butt thing but not the movie yeah well it'd be
4204220	4208220	interesting it almost seems like we give awards 30 years from now we'll give
4208220	4217140	awards to engineers who fooled us into thinking we had free will like that
4217140	4223540	they'll go like oh this guy is like this genius or lady and well it's not
4223540	4226180	even funny anymore
4228580	4233340	that because I've played like I've played games like where I thought you
4233340	4237260	know oh I'm making these choices and I'm having all this anxiety about Guinefer
4237260	4242940	versus whatever the what's the guy the Witcher 3 like storylines I was like ah
4243020	4247500	the brunettes being so mean I'm gonna but and then I was like wait this could
4247500	4251700	be totally on rails and like you if you like you said a trip to the grocery
4251700	4255580	store like there's laws you don't even know you're able to break because you're
4255580	4260100	so given to just like staying in lanes but but at the same time you could
4260100	4264500	create a situation where people feel like a rebel for buying Lucky Charms and
4264500	4269820	it's really fucked up like we're all gonna we're all gonna we're all fucked
4270060	4275220	glad you said that for a minute it wasn't dystopian enough yeah it's just it
4275220	4278660	scares me because also it seems like well then nobody's gonna go oh Dan
4278660	4286020	Harmon did such a good job on anything you know they'll be like if you go out
4286020	4291500	to the dumpster in the Lucky Charms Vin Diesel ass crack thing like there's
4291500	4297060	this Steve Bannon guy and he just if you push his left nipple he gives you a
4297060	4303420	recipe for carrot cake oh it's Dan Harmon so meta the carrot cake recipe is
4303420	4315220	a show it's like Westworld Michael let's have let's have let's have Michael come
4315220	4319420	up and ask his time travel questions go ahead so let's let's man give a round of
4319420	4326820	applause to Madison Madison was sent through time to save Michael from a
4326820	4337340	poisonous spider so that he could ask the time travel questions okay but for
4337340	4341380	the listeners he has a clipboard a binder and now a sheet of paper with
4341380	4345100	some handwritten notes on it it was a really heavy folder too I could hear it
4345100	4348340	everyone's having emotional flashbacks to that guy with that had his own
4348340	4356060	political party but Michael wasn't that a great show all right okay no so it's
4356060	4362220	Michael has made fantastic bear for me before so I supported my several times
4362220	4365340	and he gave me a whole joint I mean I guess that doesn't affect you and I gave
4365340	4370060	you a mannequin like you gave me a mannequin like I did he also gave me a
4370060	4378460	mani-pedi in the parking lot you guys have so much fun all right Dan but I
4378460	4381140	feel like the gift of the mannequin like wasn't it kind of like you were like oh
4381140	4385020	I gotta give a thing and it was like it was it was a little bit of a was it like
4385100	4389300	it was like receiving the mannequin leg like took something out of me did it
4389300	4393580	it's just my emotional memory maybe I'm okay it was someone well but it asked
4393580	4397180	first the week before you told us the terrible story about how your mannequin
4397180	4402340	leg was destroyed so the week later I brought a replacement for you that's all
4402340	4408980	I tried to do don't don't buy into this I'm just a person then that's no I
4408980	4414700	apologize for poisoning the well they don't like me anyway so so blank
4414700	4418260	slate you gave me a joint you left a note time travel questions here we go
4418260	4429580	all right if you sent yourself an email I gave you that scoop too Dan if you
4429580	4433460	sent yourself an email and you time stamped it for a thousand years in the
4433460	4437900	future would you arrive it like in this moment if you sent it right now would it
4437900	4448060	be there in a thousand years like in that moment don't look at me I didn't do
4448060	4466700	this we've we've awakened the crack it's really just a technological question
4466700	4473380	about you know what happens to email when you time stamp it but I was curious
4473380	4477500	of Dan's opinion of that is it is it is it about email or is it are you are you
4477500	4483180	basically asking are we does time travel work in a back to the future e-way or in
4483180	4490300	a way if you sent the email and it arrives there instantly if there was
4490300	4495540	some way to technologically piggyback on that and send something backwards you
4495540	4502420	can't say technological men piggyback first time first time forever
4502420	4508860	technological piggyback I'm a I am a chemical engineer what do you work on
4508860	4518340	snot it's not not don't even the super state of this isotope has what we call a
4518340	4524860	same Z's rule Michael we have time for one more one more question well I didn't
4524860	4530220	even answer I want to parse this okay okay so I'm sitting at my laptop I have
4530220	4534380	a time machine waiting over there right it's gonna take me to the future or am
4534380	4538900	I throwing out this you're just emailing yourself in the future okay so and I'm
4538900	4544020	you're gonna live forever do when you say time stamp you mean like like I'm
4544020	4551260	able to I'm marking this email it it's right now you write an email and it
4551260	4557420	arrives a thousand years from right now did you just say meow am I a cat is
4557420	4564980	this a girl of marketing for Spencer I think it's a Spencer question why he
4564980	4572340	clearly said he only wants Dan's take on this like you're a bailiwick like you
4572340	4574940	that you would know what I still don't even understand the question and it'll
4574940	4579900	go faster if I bet Spencer does or at least he knows how to break it down he
4579900	4584180	has a now asked two separate questions and the third time he's attempted to ask
4584180	4587980	I don't think he got to the meaty part of the question he just posed the
4587980	4592900	hypothetical what if you sent an email what if you send an email then what if
4592900	4597460	you could find a way if you time stamped it for a thousand years from right now
4597460	4604340	yeah if you found a way to send information back when I mean this
4604340	4611700	motherfucker works could you imagine the power of that crazy if you can send
4611700	4619700	information back in time all right let's let's do a second time travel
4619700	4626620	question I we have time we only have a 14 more questions we were gonna learn
4626620	4632060	something from Madison Madison was talking about the real future real the
4632060	4636820	thing is if Madison if Madison didn't save him from the spider this might
4636820	4641540	never have happened might never have happened alternate timelines bring that
4641540	4650140	spider back where's that dr. Pepper can all right the darkest timeline all right
4650140	4653900	this is where it all started all your timelines okay let him lay down all
4653900	4660860	right so do you know how torrenting works torrenting yeah I may have procured a
4660860	4671860	few copies of Photoshop six in my 20s Sains authorization let's just say
4671860	4680060	Adobe lived to appreciate my tutelage check free market to always finds away
4680060	4687140	limewire that's all I know but that's that's I was like I used limewire to
4687140	4695620	download a couple of Lincoln Park songs and all right second time time travel
4695620	4701100	question so the way torrenting works it okay it puts a bunch of pieces together
4701100	4712100	right and then makes one full copy for seeds yeah if if you said if you set a
4712100	4717100	computer to do that infinitely could you start making TV shows that haven't
4717100	4722940	even been played yet because every week when a new episode comes out everybody
4722940	4726140	just puts together these pieces that nobody's had all those pieces together
4726140	4730660	before and then what if you just sent a computer to do that an infinite number
4730660	4735820	of times when you eventually start creating content that had never existed
4735820	4743020	yeah the monkeys type in Shakespeare Fox does a version of this I guess that
4743020	4747740	is that is basically the million monkeys thing plus you'd have to well the thing
4747740	4750820	that they never they always leave out of the million monkeys typing hamlet thing
4750820	4755220	is that a million monkeys wouldn't eventually type hamlet infinite monkeys
4755220	4758940	would eventually type what will there is no eventually because they're infinite
4758940	4764540	they would they would have hamlet within them because they'd all do random things
4764540	4770140	that's the that's the that's the you'd have to someone would have to aggregate
4770140	4775580	a torrent for a TV show that didn't exist and yes if you had infinite torrent
4775580	4783620	seeds torrent clients and they all just generated random data infinite which is
4783620	4792340	the key yes you could if you would then have to know what the TV show was in
4792340	4795100	order to aggregate it which kind of defeats the purpose because if you know
4795100	4801060	it then you have seen it or it exists but if you did know what it was would
4801060	4805860	would infinite torrenters be able to randomly torrent a TV show yes it's the
4805860	4811300	infinite monkeys making let's hear from Michael everybody Michael
4811460	4814820	we save the day we solve the future
4820780	4830820	let's bring us team AG everybody's TV I want to get my AG on I want to get my
4830820	4846260	AG on I'm going into AG Ray thank you nice suits assholes right Spencer you
4846260	4855020	with yeah yeah yeah nice long pants you fucks oh wait that's yeah cuz I wear
4855020	4861140	shorts we're on the same side I'm escalating fish what's up Steve how you
4861140	4865460	doing man I'm all right you know I want I wanted to say something for a long
4865460	4870140	time there was an episode you did make a couple years ago that you talked about
4870140	4875420	something that I cannot stop thinking about the idea of shitting someone else's
4875420	4881300	parents when you die can't stop thinking about it I think about it at least twice
4881300	4886900	a week you could you could wish that as an evil power when you die you shit
4886900	4891500	someone else's pants I know basically be like because because of the retroactive
4891500	4897420	social effect would be if you're Donald Trump with a 33% approval rating you're
4897420	4902540	looking at a lot you're you're gonna tend to you're like everyone that dies
4902540	4908980	is gonna choose me I'm gonna be unable to leave the White House well that that's
4908980	4914060	why that's why he left the roommate without signing the executive order he
4914060	4920100	clearly has a shit that was the guy's like I just made I just made chocolate
4920100	4925120	poo please I have to get out of here but you just have guys like it would just be
4925120	4930340	floating in dune tanks full of sanitized shit and be like they didn't
4930340	4935540	vent a chemical that turned shit into diamonds but it emitted a fume that only
4935540	4941220	killed Hispanics you know like like they'd just be and it would be like stop
4941220	4952300	shooting in Donald Trump's pants you're not part of the solution then I think
4952300	4957780	you're being pessimistic can I tell you guys one thing I thought I saw watch
4957780	4963540	with Cody we've been on this Dahmer trip like I was a Cody and I are both writers
4963780	4968060	you know it's like I you know we don't like why we're not gonna it's hard to
4968060	4971340	watch other people stuff like like okay fine I finally found somebody that
4971340	4974820	admits like it makes me feel less petty that she agrees we watch a lot of true
4974820	4978740	crime stuff this person's being murdered this person's being eaten so we know a
4978740	4982860	little bit of a Dahmer kick and there's not a lot of quality Dahmer films out
4982860	4986260	there that's like like did you go quickly from the documentaries about him
4986260	4993060	to the like docudramas and one of them is called raising Jeffrey Dahmer and
4993060	4998260	it's a it's told from the perspective of his father and so you're like oh wow
4998260	5003220	it's an interesting idea and you rent it and it's like a twenty dollar movie I
5003220	5009500	mean the budget was twenty dollars it's like you wrote that as a sketch it's
5009500	5014380	exactly what you tried as a sketch it fades into the guy like looking through
5014380	5018700	a microscope because I guess his dad did that at work and then the phone rings
5018700	5023140	and it goes like well he's like look at the thing of the phone rings and it
5023140	5034700	goes like Dahmer it's all sing-song like zippity-doo now like raising normal kids
5034700	5040500	is my game Dahmer's my name nothing walking on cloud nine ordinary world you
5040500	5045420	called the world of common day no thresholds crossed that's my motto
5045500	5058700	Dahmer and then he goes he what he ate who the whole body it's like a pop new
5058700	5067300	heart bed is a guy what how why well what did he what well I don't know well
5067300	5072500	hold on I don't know well goodbye and then he calls another my goes well like
5072580	5078620	calls like his mother is Martha the police just called me they said that
5078620	5083900	Jeffrey's been arrested something about a murder I don't know that's what I asked
5083900	5087220	them and he just keeps going that another person calls it goes like hello
5087220	5093820	what multiple people like it's just it's like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are
5093820	5102420	dead if Hamlet was about clearing an apartment of 17 corpses that's all that
5102420	5105780	happened in Hamlet this is Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead so it's he
5105780	5113580	fucked the corpse in the what 16 people and he just keeps at one point he goes home he
5113580	5118260	lives in a one-bedroom apartment Martha I I mean just logistically that's him
5118260	5124300	strange at one point he goes home and then he goes through the reporters and
5124300	5129420	they're going like mr. Dahmer what about your son eating all the people and he's
5129420	5134380	like wow leave me alone just leave me alone this is my home and he goes in and
5134380	5138860	he talks to his wife and he goes like they're all out there they all they want
5138860	5144740	to do is just talk about Jeff eating people I don't know what's going on
5144740	5149100	sweetie I don't know and then they sit on the couch together and he he picks up
5149100	5154660	the remote for the TV and and turns it on with this determined look on his face
5154660	5160900	and then the news is talking about Jeffrey Dahmer and the mind-blower is
5160900	5166100	when the news is talking about Jeffrey Dahmer he react he goes like oh and turns
5166100	5171140	it off like well he was his goal was to watch Juke's a hazard he was gonna he
5171140	5176380	was gonna get his mind off things his son ate 17 people he turned on the new I
5176380	5179660	thought he was doing it to get more information but he was like her place
5179660	5185820	like what what everyone would get over it it's like a broken record with this
5185820	5192700	society I season finale of silver spoons my son apparently ate a measurable
5192700	5196900	percentage of the local community and the local news is all fucking having a
5196900	5206660	field day about it I don't get it what all these reporters I know I just do I
5206660	5209420	didn't want it if I waited two weeks to talk about that then it'd be like
5209420	5213340	you guys two weeks ago I watched this movie and you would detect you'd go like
5213340	5217300	Harmon's a little rusty but he doesn't have that joy when you just watch this
5217300	5221340	I hit close to home for you because that was that's your hometown yeah wait what
5221340	5228500	on earth what and the anthrax is going on somebody's handed me a note and she
5228500	5241100	ran out the building a list of microaggressions we hold these truths to
5241100	5246820	be self-evident Jeff Davis you have on the following occasions afflicted abraded
5246820	5254660	and otherwise transgressed the the people's just keep talking I have to I
5254660	5263780	have zero killer font in Portland they don't have dispensaries dispensaries have
5263780	5271580	you in Portland they have pot stores yeah in Oregon of course if we worked
5271580	5275780	we spent the last two decades like I mean we didn't really put any elbow
5275780	5279940	grease into it but we were like make it's technically medicine come on I'm
5279940	5286180	sick and I had to go see a guy with a ponytail stethoscope or like lie about
5286180	5293260	nausea like I didn't become a pot smoker just so I could lie also they run
5293260	5297060	you're they they if you tell them a thing that you've been told to tell them
5297060	5301500	they will then question it yeah they'll be really because it's bullshit and at
5301500	5304500	one point you kind of want to be like a motherfucker you ain't a real doctor no
5304500	5309500	more anyway beer you wouldn't be here trying to write licenses for weed
5309540	5316380	motherfucker what's your story yeah yeah what is this just scope for protesting
5316380	5321420	so much right the answer why the stethoscope is because the ponytail and
5321420	5326020	you're unwilling to give up and it's awesome to listen to your heartbeat when
5326020	5333840	you're high as fuck yeah but but you don't know Colorado and Oregon they
5333840	5338060	legalized it it's not medicinal it's fucking pot you just buy it you're like
5338060	5342500	there to get high it's so amazing you'd go in you give a driver's license this
5342500	5346380	guy they sent us big buzzed us in you go back the mason jars and all that stuff
5346380	5350180	just like a dispensary but there's no pretense of like me it's my prescription
5350180	5354340	and here my thing you're just like I was like okay so what do you got in a I
5354340	5358900	literally did this like I was like doing it half jokingly but then it worked I was
5358900	5362040	like she was like a what do you call it a Somalia or what do you go with the
5362040	5368460	same old some old some old Somalia Somalia a Somalian she was like a she
5368460	5377300	was Somali she boarded your ship and took you I said what do you have in a 44
5377300	5383800	year old walking around Portland tends to check his pulse for 20 minutes if he
5383800	5388880	gets too high but likes the and as she was like listed I was like yeah I'm here
5388880	5394320	to do a public radio show but I gotta be sober with three hours from now but
5394320	5397800	also I can't get on the plane with too much but like also just describing like
5397800	5403680	like yeah I didn't vote for Trump but you know I'm starting to lose faith in
5403680	5408480	the liberals and I just feel like nihilistic and anarchistic again but I
5408480	5411800	don't want to feel that way and I feel like I have part of it is emotional
5412040	5419560	she's like removing jars from a group as I was like Cody was watching and she
5419560	5423120	was like I was like was I was I imagine she's like no she for real was like
5423120	5427960	really listening to you and like down to the last things it was like okay that
5427960	5433160	eliminates that jar and then let me smell just a bunch of pot and then and
5433160	5438320	then I got a joint of that pot and it was great it's all it's all it was yeah
5438320	5441960	she might have been fucking with me but well in Portland that's what they do in
5441960	5447160	Portland they they make a big deal about this one's got faux beans it's made out
5447160	5451560	of lettuce and this one's full of mint flavor and it's good for reading and
5451560	5456600	like it's a weird thing you go in LA they do that a tiny bit and it's on the
5456600	5460880	signage but no one does that but in Portland they have cards and they see
5460880	5465880	you know they want to get get your number and stuff it's a language I swear
5465880	5471360	I wish I had recorded it me I was like I got it because it hurt it was so like
5471360	5475720	yeah it was you couldn't write it and it was like so sincere and it was like yeah
5475720	5480160	all this chest nutty after mellow and this one with a lift up and then a
5480160	5487000	giggle puss and a thing I walked into a if I've told it before stop me I was on
5487000	5490840	the road in Washington State with Ryan Stiles and Greg Proops and like the
5490840	5497000	whose line guys and we pulled off the road there was a sense that deli weed
5497000	5503880	liquor it's like a barn in the middle of a farm we pull off there and crazy oh
5503880	5512360	yeah it's it's it's it's ten it's exactly 10 a.m. and they just opened up
5512360	5517640	and we walked in and there's like three like 24 year old guys working there and
5517640	5522680	they were clearly just high as Georgia pines like they'd already really gotten
5522680	5529880	it on and the cast of whose lands anyway walks in and 24 year olds grew up on
5529880	5532480	that because their parents would watch that with them when they were six
5532480	5538800	because that was family TV that they could all watch together and they
5539800	5543600	absolutely freaked the fuck out give them a suggestion
5543600	5558160	give them a suggestion they forgot to charge us it was amazing do we have do
5558160	5562200	we have business we got we have business we're doing we're doing our last few
5562200	5566160	shows here at meltdown we're gonna be permanently moving over to that Star
5566160	5570520	Burns location because in three weeks Isis is blowing up a meltdown comment
5570520	5582080	thank you Michael for giving us that heads up yeah but we have a lot we have
5582080	5586360	a lot of special alumni guests that are coming on the next two weeks to send us
5586360	5589880	off in grand fashion right where they supposed to be surprises or let's keep a
5589880	5595400	surprise I heard one name and I was like oh goodie it rhymes with Faye
5595400	5600960	Minow it's jail oh shit no it's not to them I'm joking that Jay Leno's not
5600960	5607880	coming good boo but we'll be doing that and then we'll be yeah I don't know do
5607880	5611120	you guys still care about the tax March isn't that happening oh yeah yeah yeah
5611120	5615440	thank you April 15th we got to do that I'm exhausted too I don't know we're
5615440	5618880	going we're doing it I'm hoping the march will like awaken something in me
5618880	5622040	because we gotta we gotta we gotta do it I think we should all make signs all
5622040	5628840	of us make signs and a beautiful big sign to say paid protester but like
5628840	5635960	really dress up I use my tax refund on this protest yeah I wish there was a way
5635960	5638880	to I mean it's like we all look at our crystal balls and we go like well we
5638880	5642440	already know that they'll just look at record numbers of people flooding the
5642440	5647200	streets of their hometowns and I like saying show us your taxes but it all
5647200	5651120	makes a difference cynicism is the biggest tool of any repressive regime
5651120	5654640	anything you do that shows your participation yeah always because it's
5654640	5659840	not him that we're trying to affect it's the people watching the televisions that
5659840	5663560	are just in mixed company and are like on the bubble or up in the air or
5663560	5667760	confused like I couldn't believe the women's March was like we're still
5667760	5671640	riding that wave because it was just sheer numbers and people who get cynical
5671640	5675880	about it not having an actual effect like I mean they can they can kiss my
5675880	5682440	grits even if just it's a hard line then it's a hard line even if just
5682440	5685480	galvanizes other people that see you doing it that is something right as I
5685480	5691840	said before imagery for this illiterate asshole is everything he looks at
5691840	5696360	pictures he sees them and they affect him and it bothers him but it's let's
5696360	5699960	go out and make make pictures happen because he reads pop-up books for a
5699960	5704120	living so we and it's the undecideds which is we always joke about that like
5704120	5707240	how could you be undecided during the election but it's like more like are you
5707240	5713280	undecided between being a Bernie Kratt and a neoliberal or something like that
5713280	5719360	like like we're coming up on a huge hurricane of stuff like we need to me
5719360	5722720	when I'm like like getting in arguments or watching arguments online I'm always
5722720	5726400	thinking of the people that are nowhere in sight they're just the people
5726400	5730480	watching and and that's why I always have to try to remind myself like are
5730480	5734800	you the smartest funniest person in this conversation or are you the
5734800	5738760	angriest piece of shit that's like like wishing I see I'm starting to see these
5738760	5743240	arguments erupting between different factions where people people that would
5743240	5747840	have us believe this is about health care and universal health care in fact
5747840	5754600	meaning they want ostensibly everybody to be healthy are saying when they don't
5754600	5757760	like the way an argument is going well then burn in fucking hell enjoying eight
5757760	5761080	years of Trump you piece of shit and it's like all right well that's bumping
5761080	5766040	up against your universal health care and I'm not I'm not and I don't even like poke
5766040	5769520	that horn it's not I had a good experience on this last trip we did we
5769520	5776280	did Akron Ohio Indianapolis and Louisville Kentucky and Akron's a little
5776280	5780440	more red than in Indianapolis which is actually you can find like it's kind of
5780440	5786080	blue and in Indianapolis and I had a resist pin on the Greg Proops I got some
5786080	5789160	fan of his gave me like a little safety pin that like beads that resist on it
5789160	5794400	and in Akron they kind of see it they notice it but they don't talk about it
5794400	5798920	Indianapolis people came up and said thank you like like awesome and we did
5798920	5802560	our show and we banged on Mike Pence because he's from there we banged him
5802560	5806240	hard and the crowd like almost stood up and fucking cheered because they like in
5806240	5811280	Indianapolis like fuck that guy let's go find out where he lives or he sold us
5811280	5814440	out someone else lives right now like let's let's still go let's you know that
5814680	5818480	we talked earlier about how all the internet is making some people feel like
5818480	5823560	like the the plague is at their door and that's where it's like crucible for
5823560	5827240	racism and stuff and that's another thing is like if that person that that
5827240	5832120	mythical construct that person that has been feeling from reading their Facebook
5832120	5838000	feed that that that someone took their jar but like they're they're also gonna
5838000	5843000	see like like like they need to see and then they'll want to dismiss it look
5843000	5846880	like oh look at all those lesbians and biracial's like just wanting to take my
5846880	5850520	jar but they're marching about it but there's there's people that are in the
5850520	5853600	on the bubble that are in the air that are like you know I feel this pressure
5853600	5856680	I feel like the world's changing and I'm scared of the world and all this stuff
5856680	5859600	and I think that's why it's so important that those signs are really funny and
5859600	5863960	really and like that and that there's like like happy-looking people out there
5863960	5867560	and it's like and and shit doesn't get fucked up and set on fire my favorite
5867560	5871640	that was a sign in Scotland during the Muslim ban marches and they marched in
5871640	5876240	Glasgow and shit and a sign said your ma was an immigrant you're absolute
5876240	5878720	roaster
5878720	5884160	I don't even know what a roaster means it's just it's fucking you absolute
5884160	5888760	roaster that's so you know what a roaster means also at the end of the day the
5888760	5894040	reason that we amass is to show that there are more of us and that you can
5894040	5899360	have 750,000 of us show up very peaceably right 75 of us show up armed
5899360	5902720	right and at the point that we all start to head out to the town square the
5902720	5907280	government and people in charge should sort of be like shit let's go ahead and
5907280	5909920	talk to these people so one of the reasons you want to go to you want to
5909920	5913040	go to rallies you want to go to marches is so that we don't have to be in those
5913040	5917240	smaller numbers having to do fiercer shit yeah protests scare the
5917240	5922120	establishment they really do and letters and calls and all that shit it's TV's
5922120	5927240	and it's fucked up but I'd rather go out there and be silly and make a like have
5927240	5931800	a tambourine to be a fucking noisy asshole and do it every goddamn weekend
5931800	5936320	anytime you're free and do it because we have an idiot president who hates
5936320	5940440	turning on the TV because it's all he watches it's all he does he doesn't read
5940440	5944440	books he doesn't read the paper he turns the TV on if he sees imagery of people
5944440	5949120	all over the country and all over the world mocking him yeah it affects him so
5949120	5952880	and it's like a Dick Clark special if you're living in a town where you're
5952880	5958560	actually in the in the minority as you're as a liberal like I mean I my
5958560	5962360	heart goes out to you and I god knows I haven't done anything difficult during
5962360	5967400	all of this shit but like just you know just as a suggestion it's like oh there's
5967400	5971880	not gonna be 17,000 people in my town flooding into the square and also there
5971880	5975920	might be a bunch more people showing up and you know kind of like glaring at me
5975920	5980000	that are that are on the other side all the more reason to like make your sign
5980000	5984800	funny so that so that you have the truth on your side and humor on your
5984800	5988780	side and the high road on your side if there's 50 of you and it's like CNN's
5988780	5993200	still gonna cut to that during that morning and the image of the little
5993200	6000240	girl holding a sign in DC that said Trump eats farts like that's that's heavy
6000240	6004660	fucking hitting what are you gonna say it's very important to think about who
6004660	6008520	the audience is for so it's important that you could be funny but also it
6009120	6013480	excuse me patriotic and nonviolent and all those things like it should speak
6013480	6017720	to a portion of the country I know it's got all my voice here we got a press
6017720	6022800	tour like you've been talking a lot I have been talking a lot or is the clan
6022800	6033520	trying to suppress your words what does Jarba mean get off me devil I mean we
6033520	6038440	still have some time left I Dan I don't think we're done with your Gary Busey
6038440	6042320	impression I think that has to come back at least for a moment I think maybe
6042320	6047920	in rap form I think that we have to pass it down the line maybe Gary Busey comes
6047920	6054240	in and does a verse I do Gary Busey rap just from what's happened shit are you
6054240	6058520	ready to rock on that does that what you want I just want to talk about that
6058520	6062440	weird ceremony that leave you did on the sidewalk where they put a
6063440	6069280	trifle and still a man but Milan they were trifling with them try to fill in
6069280	6072800	tiffle I don't know if Ellen leave he sent us picture leave he was walking
6072800	6078640	down the sidewalk and a acidic tied up his arm was a weird it was a really
6078640	6083120	grab the mic and break it down for us and they put him ladies and gentlemen
6083120	6094080	make some noise I mean look at this hair he just sniped me yeah I was walking
6094080	6101600	down the street in Beverly Hills he's like you're Jewish I was like yeah he's
6101600	6112240	like you got to do to fill in I mean I didn't know what to say so yeah I don't
6112240	6116680	I don't really want to but you but did you know what that was yeah yeah yeah
6116680	6120920	cuz I don't what is break it down for the for the goyim I mean I don't know
6120920	6128360	exactly what it is but I like I remember yeah it's certainly a mitzvah right well
6128360	6134720	I remember like in college the rabbi the local rabbi knew who I was cuz my roommate
6134720	6139960	was more religious a little bit and he introduced me was a good guy like we
6139960	6145560	went to a class once where like everyone got to discuss Judaism and God
6145560	6149680	and whatever and I was like yeah I don't know and everyone would say their thing
6149680	6153540	was in open discussion and he liked having me there cuz I represented the
6153540	6157760	side that doesn't believe all right so you're saying you're setting us up you're
6157760	6161160	saying I as a character I'm kind of a secular Jew is what you're yeah yeah I'm
6161160	6167520	culturally Jewish definitely like but I'm not practicing right and but he won
6167520	6172040	one time in college was like oh Levy come on come on you got to do you got
6172040	6175160	to do some to fill in and I was like I don't I don't want to in the same
6175160	6179000	situation anyway I was in this restaurant on campus there was another guy on the
6179000	6182960	other side of the room and he's saying like come on you got to do you got to
6182960	6186560	have this thing it's it's really delicious and then it broke into this
6186560	6192320	argument between the people saying tastes great to fill in now it's a it's a
6192320	6197000	reference to a light beer campaign from the 80s it's a diva I couldn't even I
6197520	6204360	I can't believe I didn't think of that I couldn't I thought it was the thing you
6204360	6207520	did between acts like there's gonna be magician and then you do something to
6207520	6212760	fill in another act comes on and then you'll do another thing to fill in all
6212760	6216520	right so you're you were familiar with to fill in the photos I saw you yeah
6216520	6223240	it's like a hellraiser like a centabyte you it was a little wild yeah it's not
6223240	6232600	it doesn't look ancient at all yeah it's like this hellraiser cube Cody just
6232600	6239400	quoted Cody described as like some kind of like S&M thing with like yeah it's
6239400	6243640	like they wrap it around your finger and then yes start you said yes I'll do to
6243640	6247160	fill and then he starts wrapping your arm he was just like come on come on it
6247160	6251080	takes 30 seconds and I was like I don't really and he just kept getting you got
6251080	6255080	it out and I was like all right well I guess I have to and then what is the
6255080	6258680	process like well then he okay so then he he he like he starts wrapping it
6258680	6262800	around and like and then it stays on your arm in this place and he's telling
6262800	6266480	he's giving you words through Hebrew words to repeat it's because it's a
6266480	6270640	prayer I guess and then he's like wraps around my head and it looks like a this
6270640	6275080	the cue my head yeah you're not on a public street in this yeah in front of
6275080	6280080	earth in front of Earth cafe and everyone's fucking watching me do this
6280080	6283400	thing and I was like I don't want to do this I don't know what I'm saying did
6283400	6287640	you ever say and I don't want to he gave me a piece of matzah for Passover thank

6336680	6340840	terrible I've never tried a guy in the photo he looks like he's your age he's
6340840	6344960	like a young kid he's young he's sitting at the whole Indiana Jones hat in a suit
6344960	6348360	and he's like he's any so he's like taking you to think I'm not trivial yeah
6348360	6354080	and my mom is laughing at me taking pictures like hi you but how did you
6354080	6357880	have those pictures because the pictures are of you yeah my mom told your mom you
6357880	6362200	were with your mom yeah she's the only one laughing right now do you think did
6362200	6365240	you do it cuz you were with your mom maybe no I didn't want to do it at all
6365240	6368600	was your mom like that's both I think even she was like uncomfortable like oh
6368600	6375920	I don't know did he try to to filled in her what no women no he's not allowed to
6375920	6381200	touch her he has to seal himself in over I don't know leavey two-part
6381200	6386640	you and a question so there's a roving pack of Hasidim that are want why we
6386640	6393760	were young row for a seat and they they had a bag of matzahs and they and they
6393760	6398320	they pro they profile you as a Jew I was walking down the street and went hey
6398320	6404200	you're Jewish and I was like and they make here's a piece of matzah also now
6404200	6408360	you have to do to fill in because you took it like oh that's the worst that's
6408360	6412280	like when someone gives you their CD and is like yeah it's like the right
6412280	6415920	yeah it's like the raptists on Hollywood Boulevard or in Times Square so they gave
6415920	6420560	you the matzah first yeah yeah I forgot that detail I'm sorry sorry that's
6420560	6424740	about that's fucking blackmail yeah and then it's like you're gonna give the
6424740	6428920	matzah bit like you know it's not to put you find a point on it it's uh it's
6428920	6439560	my sugar I just I don't want to turn into a xenophobic dogpile thing of like
6439560	6443960	what's with you crazy people but but no I just thought of that incident on that
6443960	6448680	street like that guy was he like well how did you feel about him emotionally as
6448680	6452360	a person I mean you liked were you mad at him or were you did you feel like no
6452360	6459920	I mean would you say the spider from going down his head I don't know I like
6459920	6464400	compared to like if a panhandler drew you into a fucking word problem yeah
6464400	6469700	that's how I felt but because of the Jewish connection I don't know like he
6469700	6473440	was only going for is it like what did you feel I felt violated I knew I was
6473440	6477800	doing a mitzvah but I felt violent but would you say that he was would it be
6477800	6482520	would it be accurate to say if I was a that he was like was it like if you were
6482520	6487840	Catholic you know like a lap cat right like like was there was there a guilt
6487840	6492200	like like like you know you didn't want to be a bad prey to my Jew guilt right
6492200	6497040	yeah that was that was present in your head right you're like I'm the entire
6497040	6502320	time as I didn't know how to say no to that I mean I don't know if I wouldn't
6502320	6506880	know how to say no to him if I was if he but anyone else asked me anything and I
6507240	6510240	probably would have known how to get out of that situation I was just doing a
6510240	6514200	show in Utah and there was a couple Mormon guys and they would make you put
6514200	6530720	on magic underwear true story Gary busy rap the show is almost over did he even
6530720	6533480	did he say well he was rapping that because that belt looked like it took
6533480	6536960	so it was real tight you ever say like very precise wrap around you go thanks
6536960	6541640	for doing this by the way a lot of people don't do it no and the funny
6541640	6546160	thing is we went into tough corn we went into a store like a couple stores down
6546160	6550680	and then my mom was holding this piece of matzah and this guy walks in and he
6550680	6554920	was like oh Jesus he got you too
6557480	6563400	this guy but this guy shit this guy he walked he walked in double-fisting matzahs
6563400	6568440	so maybe a better job than me I don't know by the way I'm Italian I just
6568440	6574560	haven't had a haircut in a while he's that religious what's the end game for
6574560	6579280	this person that he's saving souls I don't know yeah no they're yeah yeah
6579280	6584240	tomorrow's pat the first day Passover but he's having a good time I don't know
6584240	6591240	I didn't ask him I I just felt too bad to I was I was frozen give give give
6591240	6594800	aren't you chances as our I believe they followed the Rebbe in Brooklyn and
6594800	6597920	it's like a specific thing they're not that doesn't it's not normal Jewish
6597920	6601320	stuff it's like a very specific thing like you can be raised Jewish as I was
6601320	6605760	and the film will never come up in your well yeah we know it's a straight yeah
6605760	6611040	but like but yeah I think I'm kind of wondering like is it a I guess
6611040	6614240	evangelical isn't the right word like that though yeah but it's like it's the
6614240	6617800	idea that you're supposed to actually but it's which is enough into the normal
6617800	6621720	spirit of Judaism like you're not supposed to actively recruit right so
6621720	6628640	it is like when a black dude hands me a rap CD identical I'm like goddamn bro
