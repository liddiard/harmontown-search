0	20240	Hello, one and all, welcome to Largo in Los Angeles, California.
20240	25240	A very special Harbin Town is now in session.
25240	33240	Once you're one and all, please welcome to the stage the Mayor of Harbin Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
55240	59240	Dan has foamed his beer.
59240	64240	All right, sorry about that. Well, this should be a real, as usually promised,
64240	69240	we really got to keep this thing moving on Ruby rails, Jeff.
69240	77240	I mean, for the podcast listener, there is a dais, there are four chairs, which bodes well,
77240	81240	and there is what can only be described as a Stanley Cup full of vodka.
82240	85240	And two bottles.
85240	91240	Well, this is an Alliance member level. Thank you, Kettle One.
91240	99240	Dan Harmon, a new member of the, for me, Unknown Alliance Club for Kettle One Vodka.
99240	101240	The real cirrhosis club.
101240	107240	All right. We got to pack 90 minutes of excitement into 45, and we've got three guests, Jeff.
107240	113240	Okay, Dan, we started, it's 813. We started at 812. Do I have to stop at 45 from 812?
113240	115240	45 from now? Yeah. I don't know.
115240	118240	Let's just call it fucking nine. We're going to be done with Harbin Town.
118240	121240	Then we get into the next stuff. I don't know. All right.
121240	123240	I've never been on stage at Largo.
123240	127240	If something really funny happens in five seconds, we're going to end the show.
127240	130240	Well, I'll go to the Roger Room and get fucked up on Fernet Bronker.
130240	135240	Largo has a rich history. The legendary Flanagan runs this place.
135240	140240	Lovely Flanagan. Thank you, Flanagan, for having us. Flanney to his friends.
140240	144240	He got Jack Black hooked on heroin here. Yeah.
144240	150240	He killed Graham Parsons. A lot of people don't know that. He actually murdered Graham Parsons.
150240	162240	Andy Kindler's balls were hit with a hammer by Amy Mann over in the corner. I don't know. Largo people.
162240	166240	It's a rich, rich tapestry of history. Largo people.
166240	172240	We're honored to be here, and we're going to show you some Rick and Morty stuff later.
172240	180240	All right. I'm worried. I'm worried that because you're seated with a giant flagon of vodka right now
180240	186240	that you won't be as dynamic as you normally are at Meltdown Comics when you stand up and treat the people.
187240	192240	What good does expressing the worry do? Is that like a hot air balloon?
192240	194240	No. It's like the fire will make me go higher?
194240	197240	It's a challenge. I'm saying if you're going to be seated, fucking bring the thunder.
197240	205240	I'm bringing it. Name a topic. I heard socks. I got these socks. They don't match. Okay. What else?
205240	210240	I heard firemen. What takes them so long?
211240	216240	Racism. Racism? What's with black people? Why are they so bad?
216240	221240	Shit. See, if you were standing, you would have been more racist.
221240	230240	The intention was to come down against racism, not a race. Sorry, black people. Again.
230240	234240	All right. So we need to bring up our first guest right away.
234240	236240	We have a fucking surfeit of celebrity guests for the show.
236240	238240	There's too much to do. There's too much to do.
238240	240240	There's no time to fucking dick about.
240240	243240	What have you been up to? I've gained a lot of weight.
243240	250240	And there's two thresholds I cross when I gain a certain amount of weight.
250240	258240	In ascending order of disturbance, the first is back pain.
259240	262240	Because I have like walking for two.
262240	266240	Like actually just like notice at a certain point that my back hurts.
266240	269240	And then I look, I think back and go, oh, was I carrying something?
269240	272240	Yes, I was, but not with my arms.
272240	275240	The second thing is a little thing called sleep apnea.
275240	278240	For those of you in the audience who are familiar with this,
278240	282240	this is when you get so fat that when you're asleep,
282240	287240	sometimes your body forgets you're supposed to be alive.
287240	292240	That's sleep apnea. Your body forgets to breathe.
292240	297240	You wake up going, because you're that fat.
297240	301240	Have you been fatter than right now? Have you been fatter?
301240	308240	Ask an objective observer. I mean, is Pluto fatter than Mercury?
309240	313240	You're not going to get a definitive answer from anyone other than Earth.
313240	318240	Have you weighed more than you currently weigh?
318240	320240	I don't weigh myself. I don't truck with that.
320240	325240	Have you looked in the mirror and been less or more disappointed than you are right now?
325240	329240	Mirrors play tricks. I saw some communic-
329240	331240	Funhouse mirrors play tricks.
331240	335240	I saw some communicon photos that were a bummer.
335240	340240	I was like, is that Dan Aykroyd at the Madame Toussaint Museum?
340240	345240	Is that a planet of hair?
345240	353240	I do a bit in the community writers room where I have two characters named Sam and Diane
353240	355240	that are on opposite sides of my gut.
355240	357240	Where are you? Sam!
357240	359240	Diane, I can't find you.
359240	363240	Let's bring out our first guest.
363240	370240	He's my partner. This is a cleverly disguised advertisement for our show, Rick and Morty.
370240	374240	Our first guest is co-creator of Rick and Morty, Justin Roiland.
379240	380240	Hi, buddy.
380240	382240	Hey, how are you?
382240	385240	You know, I just want to say I think you look as spelt as ever.
385240	386240	Thanks, buddy.
386240	390240	I don't know about all this talk about being overweight. You look beautiful.
390240	391240	Thanks, Justin.
391240	395240	And after the show, I got a bag of Doritos waiting for you with your name on it.
395240	398240	Oh, he's like the Colonel and I'm Elvis. He's hooking me.
398240	400240	I'm like an enably.
400240	402240	He keeps me going with riboflavin.
402240	404240	He's like Flanagan to Graham Parsons.
404240	406240	Yeah.
406240	408240	Murdered Graham Parsons, you guys.
408240	410240	Hey, listen, it's an honor to be here.
410240	415240	And boy oh boy, do we have something really special in store for all of you tonight.
415240	418240	Justin has a thing he was talking about backstage.
418240	424240	Now, you're a guy who on any given day you'll talk about Skull Island with the gold and the reserves and the...
424240	428240	Talk about the fucking Woodrow Wilson Federal Reserve.
428240	429240	Fucking Jekyll Island.
429240	432240	You're sort of a doomsday prepper.
432240	433240	You're kind of a...
433240	436240	I mean, listen, a show of hands. I can't see you because the lights are bright.
436240	442240	But a show of hands. How many people think this country is just going right down into the poopy hole?
442240	443240	Can I get a show of hands?
443240	444240	Well, nobody's gonna...
444240	445240	Anybody?
445240	446240	Who's gonna...
446240	448240	You think Captain America's here?
448240	449240	Everyone's raising their hands.
449240	452240	You think one guy's gonna be like two sparklers and...
452240	455240	No one profits from saying that America's doing great.
455240	458240	That was the 40s.
458240	459240	But you know...
459240	462240	The only way to earn a dollar right now is to say we're fucked.
462240	464240	That's the only thing that anyone's buying.
464240	466240	We're really fucked, ladies and gentlemen.
466240	470240	And if you just put a dollar on the edge of the stage there...
470240	475240	But you, specifically, you think that we're fucked for a really specific Art Bell kind of reason.
475240	477240	Well, here's the thing.
477240	479240	We do know that the Earth is being polluted.
479240	487240	We do know that we, as a human race, we've crossed a threshold in technology that is causing just chaos.
487240	490240	I mean, we're all glued to these fucking little tablet screens and everything.
490240	494240	And we probably think, hey, this is good for us. This is great and wonderful.
494240	495240	Seems healthy.
495240	503240	What you don't realize is that for the last century, the gray almond-eyed aliens have been living among us.
503240	507240	I'm not trying to be funny. I'm not trying to fucking be a...
507240	510240	You know, I'm dead serious. I believe this to be true.
510240	513240	And I know that they've been here.
513240	515240	You're still being funny.
515240	519240	Look, you can laugh with me or at me.
519240	520240	But you have to laugh.
520240	524240	But I'd prefer you laugh at me if you don't believe it.
524240	525240	Because it's true.
525240	532240	And they are here to enslave the human race and take the planet Earth from us.
532240	535240	And they're going to come here and they're going to say, oh, we want to fix it all for you.
535240	538240	You're polluting it and you're doing this and that and the other thing.
538240	539240	But guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
539240	542240	We're the gray-eyed almond-shaped eye aliens.
542240	546240	And we're here and we're going to go ahead and fix it all for you.
546240	548240	We're going to get rid of the nuclear bombs.
548240	553240	We're going to get rid of all the shit China's doing and polluting the waters and all that shit.
553240	556240	So they're going to come to Earth and they're going to say, we're here to help you with China.
556240	559240	Exactly. But. But.
559240	563240	And China's going to go, you have almond eyes.
563240	565240	How can you do this?
565240	566240	Same team.
566240	571240	Your eyes are shaped like beautiful almonds.
571240	574240	And the almond farmers especially are going to be upset about this.
574240	579240	But the fact remains, don't trust these fucking aliens.
579240	586240	They're coming to enslave us, to take over the planet and to harvest the resources of Earth.
586240	589240	And questions, please. Should we introduce them?
589240	591240	One question before we bring out our panel of questioners.
591240	592240	Our esteemed panel.
592240	594240	Those resources are in order.
594240	595240	Yes.
595240	596240	Water.
596240	597240	Gold.
597240	598240	I don't know.
598240	599240	All right. You know what?
599240	600240	Tell them water, dirt.
600240	601240	Let's bring out.
601240	602240	I mean, you know.
602240	603240	We've got a lot of dirt here.
603240	605240	Let's bring out some professional oxygen.
605240	606240	Oxygen.
606240	607240	So people who plus.
607240	608240	Isn't it hydrogen they want?
608240	609240	That makes fuel.
609240	610240	Listen, man.
610240	611240	This planet is very rare.
611240	614240	I mean, ask your local scientist at the scientist center.
614240	618240	How many other Earths have they found yet that fit the description?
618240	620240	How many scientist centers have you found?
620240	621240	Not.
621240	622240	Well, there is.
622240	623240	You're right.
623240	628240	My favorite thing is that you brought out your phone because when you were going to warn people about the alien invasion,
628240	631240	there's some shit you might forget.
631240	632240	It's not that important yet.
632240	633240	Silent green is.
633240	634240	Listen.
634240	635240	Hold on a second.
636240	638240	Silent green is people.
638240	639240	I had to come prepared.
639240	641240	I had to come prepared.
641240	643240	I am doing this for you.
643240	651240	I had to make sure I didn't forget any of the most important things that have to do with my message that I'm delivering to you people.
651240	653240	And I hope you spread it after tonight.
653240	659240	Well, I have a surprise for you because we have a bona fide global level journalist here from The Daily Show, Mr. John Oliver.
659240	665240	He's a professional.
672240	674240	He's a professional.
674240	677240	Wow.
677240	678240	Wow.
678240	681240	You know how to sell your show.
681240	687240	You have to get on The Tonight Show before Leno leaves to promote Rick and Morty.
687240	688240	I don't want to talk about it, Jay.
688240	689240	What's the point?
689240	692240	We're all working for aliens.
692240	694240	You're all living a lie.
694240	700240	Yeah, I'll stay after the break, sure, yeah.
700240	702240	John, do you have any questions about...
702240	704240	I have so many questions.
704240	705240	Go ahead, try.
705240	710240	But they're not so much about aliens as the source of which this information is coming from.
710240	714240	What's happening in your head?
714240	716240	The truth is happening in my head.
716240	721240	You sound like Rand Paul's more extreme brother.
721240	724240	Listen, I have a direct connection to the others.
724240	734240	They are a very far-off race that is sending me telepathic messages and letting me know that I must communicate to humanity.
734240	736240	Well, then you're the threat.
736240	737240	What?
737240	743240	Just because someone has almond eyes, I'm more scared of the guy with a mental connection to another...
743240	747240	You know, you want to be scared of people with mental connections, then...
747240	749240	I can't wait to hear where this sentence is going.
749240	750240	I cannot wait.
750240	751240	Eat Skittles.
751240	754240	I just want to enjoy the moment of that sentence hanging in the air.
754240	759240	Now finish it.
759240	761240	I really... I don't have any...
761240	762240	Oh, come on.
762240	763240	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
763240	764240	Ask me a question, go ahead.
764240	765240	Try to fucking...
765240	768240	Justin, what's your big fear when the almond-eyed...
768240	769240	Aliens?
769240	770240	Yeah, aliens come.
770240	772240	What's the first thing that they're going to affect?
772240	774240	My biggest fear is that, you know...
774240	776240	Well, they're going to come down and they're going to say,
776240	780240	All right, y'all, here's the deal.
780240	783240	We're a bunch of almond-eyed aliens.
783240	786240	And y'all are real scared of us.
786240	789240	But hold on to your seat belts.
789240	792240	Because we're here to get rid of all the trouble, right?
792240	794240	They sound nice.
794240	795240	I know, right?
795240	797240	You have a southern accent and... Yeah.
797240	801240	And then, you know, what's really going to happen is they're going to start to...
801240	804240	Well, what they've been doing for the last century...
804240	805240	Wait, wait, what?
805240	806240	Oh, sorry, sorry. Did I skip too far ahead?
806240	807240	They've been...
807240	808240	For the last century...
808240	810240	The almond-eyed aliens have been here for a century?
810240	812240	Yeah, yeah, they've been here for a century.
812240	815240	And what they've been doing is they've been abducting humans
815240	818240	and then they've been fucking like interbreeding and shit and causing this...
818240	821240	Because the problem is they can't survive in our atmosphere.
821240	822240	They can't.
822240	824240	They can't survive in our atmosphere.
824240	827240	And the reason why is because they're a fucking alien with almond eyes.
827240	829240	They don't survive in this atmosphere.
829240	830240	Cool.
830240	831240	So what do they do?
831240	832240	Justin.
832240	833240	What do they do?
833240	834240	They live underwater in spaceships.
834240	835240	They live underground.
835240	836240	Not really.
836240	837240	Justin.
837240	838240	Yeah, go ahead.
838240	841240	Justin, what is your beef with almond-shaped eyes?
841240	845240	Also, what is the advantage for the aliens to have almond-shaped eyes?
845240	846240	That's...
846240	847240	What sort of edge does that give you?
847240	849240	Well, you got me there.
849240	850240	You got me there.
850240	854240	I'm not even going to try to have an answer for you on that one.
854240	855240	Wait a minute.
855240	858240	In their galaxy, there was like, you know, there was...
858240	864240	A million years ago, there was a huge race war between aliens with saucer-shaped eyes
864240	868240	and aliens that just had a night rider slit across their face.
868240	869240	Yes, thank you.
869240	871240	You know, it's not just about answers.
871240	876240	You're posing questions or you're at least inflecting up at the end of a sentence.
876240	879240	I have another surprise for you, Justin.
879240	881240	I'm trying to ease these people into reality.
881240	883240	Well, you did not do that.
883240	886240	In no sense did you ease anyone into anything.
886240	889240	You came in hot.
889240	890240	You've created chaos.
890240	891240	There was no sense of...
891240	893240	I got a couple of anecdotes and then it was...
893240	896240	You came in shouting at traffic.
896240	901240	Listen, you know, you want to believe what you want to believe.
901240	902240	That's fine.
902240	905240	But I'm telling you right now, they are here.
905240	907240	They've been doing all this crazy shit.
907240	908240	What's your proof?
908240	911240	What evidence do you have to convince me?
911240	913240	That's a really good question.
914240	915240	It's a good deal.
915240	916240	No.
916240	917240	I have another surprise for you.
917240	918240	Yeah, go ahead.
918240	919240	We have a medical expert here.
919240	920240	Jesus Christ.
920240	921240	Yes.
921240	924240	She worked at St. Scrubs for eight years under Bill Lawrence.
924240	925240	Please welcome Sarah Chalk.
925240	927240	Yeah!
932240	936240	And she found out she was doing the show tonight.
936240	937240	Was it tonight?
937240	939240	Because you followed me on Twitter?
939240	943240	Well, thank God I follow at Dan Harmon on Twitter.
943240	947240	Otherwise, I'd be like, the douche who didn't show up tonight.
947240	950240	I was reading his Twitter and it was like,
950240	953240	at Dan Harmon, at Largo, with at John Oliver.
953240	956240	And I just didn't really do that Sarah Chalk.
956240	959240	And I was like, oh, I think that's me.
959240	960240	I apologize.
960240	961240	I mean, that's me.
961240	962240	And then I also...
962240	964240	I get emails from Largo, which then confirmed...
964240	965240	Right.
965240	967240	...that you are to be here tonight.
968240	971240	So have you heard Justin's theories as a medical professional?
971240	974240	Well, that's not actually why he brought me here.
974240	976240	Oh, also you do have a voice on Rick and Morty.
976240	979240	I would have preferred the bona fide journalist introduction.
979240	983240	I'm even less a journalist than you are a doctor.
983240	986240	Ladies and gentlemen, the devil's advocate to my theory.
986240	989240	I'm actually one of the results of the interpreting...
989240	992240	Sarah, you play the mom on Rick and Morty.
992240	994240	That's why you're really here.
994240	996240	And John Oliver plays a guest in the...
997240	1000240	We're going to be showing two episodes.
1000240	1002240	And John Oliver is...
1002240	1005240	He plays a wonderful character in the second one,
1005240	1007240	the Christmas one, which you'll see tonight.
1007240	1010240	I really hope that when you press play, it's not an episode.
1010240	1013240	It's just your face ranting more about Asians.
1013240	1017240	I really well thought, like I took the time to really write it out
1017240	1019240	and make it clear.
1019240	1023240	It's just my face with a glowing backlight.
1023240	1025240	Because you guys have no idea what to expect.
1025240	1028240	Have you seen anything of Rick and Morty since you did your voice work
1028240	1030240	in front of a microphone?
1030240	1032240	No, I haven't.
1032240	1035240	I saw a couple of the animatics from early on,
1035240	1038240	but I got... That's what it's called, right?
1038240	1039240	Animatics.
1039240	1040240	The animatics.
1040240	1043240	That's how you pronounce it in Canada.
1043240	1046240	But I got the part because I could burp on cue.
1046240	1047240	Right, Justin?
1047240	1048240	You're very good.
1048240	1050240	Very easy to direct.
1050240	1054240	In fact, most of the time, no direction necessary at all.
1054240	1056240	Just, she shows up and...
1056240	1058240	All right, that's it. We're done.
1058240	1059240	You did a great job.
1059240	1060240	Is that because...
1060240	1062240	Cut it in and print, wrap.
1062240	1064240	Is that because you weren't listening to her?
1064240	1066240	You were thinking about lizard people.
1066240	1068240	Yes. Yes.
1068240	1069240	That was good, Sarah.
1069240	1071240	It's just I got bigger issues right now.
1071240	1073240	I need to live underground.
1073240	1075240	It's hard to multitask the direction of an actor
1075240	1081240	while you're putting tan goods on a shelf and shotgun shells.
1081240	1082240	You guys all laugh and mock me,
1082240	1085240	but I swear to God, when they fucking show up...
1085240	1087240	And you guys are all going like, fuck.
1087240	1088240	Here's my beef, Justin.
1088240	1089240	Seriously, right?
1089240	1090240	Justin, when they show up,
1090240	1092240	you said they've been here for a century.
1092240	1093240	Yeah, yeah, they've been here for a century, yeah.
1093240	1095240	Now you're warning us about them arriving.
1095240	1096240	Well, here's the deal.
1096240	1098240	I mean, they've been here for a century.
1098240	1099240	Here's the thing.
1099240	1102240	They cannot survive in our atmosphere, ladies and gentlemen.
1102240	1104240	They have for a century by your own...
1104240	1105240	No, they can't...
1105240	1106240	Are they texting you?
1106240	1109240	They can't live on the surface of Earth, okay?
1109240	1111240	They can't just walk around and skate around like we do.
1111240	1113240	And ride our bikes and shit.
1113240	1114240	They can't do that.
1114240	1118240	So what they've been doing is they've been interbreeding with our species
1118240	1119240	for two reasons.
1119240	1122240	One, because if they fucking interbreed with our species,
1122240	1124240	then they're going to have a connection to humanity, right?
1124240	1126240	So when they do finally show up and go,
1126240	1129240	oh, we finally, after 100 years and some odd change,
1129240	1133240	we finally made a fucking version of hybrid us and you
1133240	1137240	that can totally live and hang out on Earth without any trouble,
1137240	1140240	then the fucking...
1140240	1143240	I feel like a majority of us would then at that point go,
1143240	1145240	well, you should have been upfront about it, but welcome.
1145240	1152240	But I think it's kind of our stock and trade is intermingling of DNA.
1152240	1154240	That's what we've been up to this whole time.
1154240	1156240	And then that's going to happen, like he said,
1156240	1159240	and then they're going to be like, oh, and here, by the way...
1159240	1160240	How do you...
1160240	1161240	Go ahead.
1161240	1162240	You go ahead.
1162240	1163240	Well, I was going to say, like, oh, hey,
1163240	1165240	fucking the people we made that are hybrids,
1165240	1167240	they're telepathically connected with us,
1167240	1169240	but, you know, they're related to you,
1169240	1171240	so you can't hate them, and here we go.
1171240	1174240	And then all of a sudden, flash forward 100 years,
1174240	1176240	we're all now telepathically connected with them,
1176240	1178240	and now they're monitoring our dreams,
1178240	1180240	and now they're recording every thought we have
1180240	1181240	because they're all fucking...
1181240	1183240	We all have their DNA pumping through our blood.
1183240	1188240	And then they enslave us and take over the resources of the planet Earth.
1188240	1192240	This is getting so close to a racial purity argument.
1192240	1195240	You just need to substitute two words in any of that.
1195240	1198240	I'm trying to warn you from this.
1198240	1201240	We, as a human race, need to stand up and fight these gray,
1201240	1203240	almond-shaped-eyed aliens.
1203240	1206240	Who are sometimes disguised as regular, almond-eyed people.
1206240	1207240	Right.
1207240	1210240	Like Tiger Woods, or...
1212240	1215240	Sometimes they just look like holly berries.
1215240	1217240	You know, kind of foxy.
1217240	1219240	Listen, I'm not racist.
1219240	1221240	I'm not racist, if that's what you're implying.
1221240	1224240	But if I were, if I go a little something like this...
1225240	1226240	But I...
1226240	1230240	Honestly, like, you've seen Alien Nation with...
1230240	1232240	Yeah, who hasn't seen it?
1232240	1233240	Yeah.
1233240	1235240	Like, you know, the idea...
1235240	1236240	We're all prepared for that.
1236240	1239240	The idea that, based on our experience here on Earth,
1239240	1240240	what tends to happen is...
1240240	1242240	Have you ever seen V?
1242240	1243240	Yeah.
1243240	1246240	It's a lot more like V than Alien Nation, man.
1246240	1248240	Because it's like, oh, they're cool.
1248240	1249240	They're gonna fucking help us out.
1249240	1251240	And then they're gonna be like...
1251240	1253240	Well, that's just because of the genre of TV.
1253240	1255240	Oh, shit, we're fucked now, we're fucked.
1255240	1256240	Sometimes things are like...
1256240	1258240	Sometimes things are like NYPD Blues.
1258240	1259240	Sometimes things are like Barney Miller.
1259240	1261240	It just depends if people are laughing, you know.
1261240	1263240	It's the same show.
1263240	1265240	I forget they showed his ass on...
1265240	1266240	NYPD...
1266240	1267240	Am I thinking of a different show?
1267240	1268240	Justin.
1268240	1269240	Dennis Franz.
1269240	1271240	You guys all remember Dennis Franz showing his ass?
1271240	1273240	Justin, how much of this is based on actual evidence
1273240	1275240	and not just paranoia?
1275240	1277240	I'm gonna go ahead and tell you people in the audience
1277240	1279240	that everything I just said is based on actual evidence.
1279240	1280240	It's all 100% true.
1280240	1283240	If you want to go home and fucking, you know,
1283240	1285240	pretend like all I said was a bunch of dumb nonsense,
1285240	1286240	then, you know what?
1286240	1290240	Go ahead and sleep fucking soundly tonight
1290240	1292240	and for the next coming weeks.
1292240	1294240	But I swear to God, when those aliens come
1294240	1295240	and they start abducting your children
1295240	1298240	and pregnating your daughters with half alien humans...
1298240	1299240	Oh, here we go.
1299240	1301240	Here we go.
1301240	1303240	This is where I get edgy.
1303240	1305240	They're there at Thanksgiving.
1305240	1309240	And they got engine blocks on your lawn.
1310240	1313240	You're gonna be in real trouble then.
1313240	1315240	They're putting weird shit in your DVR.
1315240	1317240	It's like, you paid for that.
1317240	1321240	You're gonna call back up this episode of Harmontown.
1321240	1323240	You're gonna put it back in your computer
1323240	1325240	and you're gonna turn it up and put your little earbuds in
1325240	1327240	and you're gonna go, holy shit.
1327240	1333240	That fucking guy who we all laughed at, he was right.
1333240	1336240	And now the planet is void of war.
1336240	1337240	It's peaceful.
1337240	1339240	There's no more nuclear weapons.
1339240	1341240	But I swear to God, these fucking gray,
1341240	1343240	ammonite aliens, they're taking over.
1343240	1345240	And they're enslaving the human race.
1345240	1347240	We're gonna be in servitude to them.
1347240	1349240	You guys all like going to Blockbuster on the weekend
1349240	1350240	and renting a movie?
1350240	1352240	It's shut down.
1352240	1353240	They're done.
1353240	1354240	Exactly.
1354240	1356240	They're literally this weak.
1356240	1357240	That's my point.
1357240	1358240	That's what the aliens are gonna do.
1358240	1359240	Oh, it's my point.
1359240	1361240	The aliens are gonna shut it down.
1361240	1363240	The aliens are gonna shut it down.
1363240	1364240	They didn't shut it down.
1364240	1366240	The inevitable advances in technology.
1366240	1368240	That's what they want you to think.
1368240	1370240	And cheese factories next.
1370240	1371240	Yeah.
1371240	1373240	I mean, do you remember when Twinkies went out of business?
1373240	1374240	Cheese factory.
1374240	1375240	Who brought it back?
1375240	1379240	Probably the fucking descendants of those disgusting gray aliens
1379240	1381240	with their ominous eyes.
1381240	1383240	And they're merging with humans.
1383240	1384240	And they're huge cocks.
1384240	1389240	And they're huge massive cocks.
1389240	1391240	And also they're really good at Monopoly.
1391240	1393240	I mean, they will fucking...
1393240	1394240	It's a new stereotype.
1394240	1396240	That is a surefire sign.
1396240	1397240	Keep your eye on them.
1397240	1398240	They're really good.
1398240	1399240	They love Monopoly.
1399240	1401240	If you're playing Monopoly, there's some guy there you don't know or girl.
1401240	1403240	And they have sort of almond-shaped eyes.
1403240	1405240	And they're just going...
1405240	1408240	Justin, just describe another shape of eye.
1408240	1410240	There's almond eyes versus...
1410240	1413240	You know, I hear a lot of stories about the lizard men
1413240	1414240	and all these other kind of aliens.
1414240	1415240	No, no, no.
1415240	1418240	There's just one alien that is here, that is present,
1418240	1421240	that is currently living on this sphere that we call Earth
1422240	1423240	that's floating in the middle of space
1423240	1427240	that we are a bunch of fucking idiots bumping around into each other on.
1427240	1431240	And those are the gray, almond-eye-shaped aliens.
1431240	1432240	And they're fucking creepy.
1432240	1434240	They're killing cattle.
1434240	1436240	I mean, I could go on and on about these characters.
1436240	1438240	Well, that's just basic butchering.
1438240	1440240	Yeah, I mean, are you going to put up for this?
1440240	1441240	We do that.
1441240	1442240	We barbecue them.
1442240	1443240	They're delicious.
1443240	1444240	Are you going to put up for this?
1444240	1446240	I think it's a little unfair to say...
1446240	1448240	Sarah, Chuck, you've been kind of quiet.
1448240	1451240	Are you either an alien or...
1451240	1454240	She does have beautiful almond-shaped eyes.
1454240	1456240	Easy, Justin. Easy, Justin.
1456240	1457240	Yes, nice.
1457240	1458240	Have you ever seen a UFO?
1458240	1461240	You know, I saw Gravity this weekend, so I got...
1461240	1462240	Close enough.
1462240	1463240	I have seen that.
1463240	1468240	Yeah, no, I was brought here because I am one of the, obviously, inter-great children.
1468240	1470240	Well, let's have a dialogue between these guys.
1470240	1473240	Have you ever met one of us before?
1473240	1475240	No, they seem kind of cool. They're nice.
1475240	1479240	I'm super-duper scared, and I wouldn't move to Alaska, if that's what you're asking me,
1479240	1483240	because that's where most of the abductions and sexual organ transplants are taking place.
1483240	1485240	No, I just wanted you to move to Canada.
1485240	1487240	Tell Sarah Chuck everything you want to tell me.
1487240	1489240	Look Sarah Chuck in the almond eyes and ask her questions.
1489240	1494240	Sarah, dialogue, will you tell these people that, like, it's all good if they want to come here
1494240	1497240	and, you know, save us from ourselves and, you know, stop all the pollution
1497240	1503240	and get rid of all these nuclear weapons, but can they just totally not enslave us as a race
1503240	1507240	and then, like, kill us off and, you know, make this crazy, you know,
1507240	1509240	we're just going to be lifting weights for them.
1509240	1514240	But then what would be the point? Why would we come here?
1514240	1516240	She's got a really good point.
1516240	1521240	I mean, we would have just stayed on our planet, then, where we actually do run everything.
1521240	1524240	I can't believe you're winning me over with this, but...
1524240	1527240	I mean, it is a compelling argument.
1527240	1531240	You know what, guys, honestly, the really bad stuff won't happen
1531240	1533240	until after we're all dead anyways.
1533240	1538240	And don't you think, Sarah, as a representative of the aliens, wouldn't you think,
1538240	1542240	guys like me and Justin and John Oliver and Jeff and most of the people here in the Harman Town audience,
1542240	1546240	we'd be kind of like, we'd have a pass, right?
1546240	1547240	Yeah, would you give us a pass?
1547240	1549240	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1549240	1550240	We get to hang out.
1550240	1551240	There's going to be, like, a...
1551240	1556240	Can we get, like, the PlayStation 4 real quick and early and, like, the Xbox One?
1556240	1558240	Or, like, a subway black card.
1558240	1559240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1560240	1562240	Five dollar footlongs for life.
1563240	1564240	Is that a fake?
1564240	1565240	Finally.
1565240	1569240	There's... I don't have a lot of skills, actually, but the ones that I do have,
1569240	1575240	there will be rock band, there will be limbo, because that's one of the only things I can do.
1575240	1576240	Okay, okay. I'm into that. I like that.
1576240	1577240	I like that. That's a good thing.
1577240	1580240	I can ride with my feet, so all of the riding will be with my feet.
1580240	1583240	That's how you can tell I'm an alien, because I have finger toes.
1583240	1584240	They're half the length of my feet.
1584240	1585240	You know, I gotta tell you.
1585240	1586240	All right, something for you, guys.
1586240	1591240	I feel like Justin's paranoia was dispelled simply by a woman looking him in the eyes.
1593240	1596240	Which can be said about a lot of internet...
1596240	1597240	From the Amandites.
1597240	1601240	Sometimes you just need Sarah Chalk to stare at you for a moment.
1601240	1602240	And you're stopping...
1602240	1608240	Listen, if all the aliens, hybrid, human, grays look like her, then fine.
1608240	1610240	What? That is literally...
1610240	1611240	Literally...
1611240	1612240	That's the argument.
1612240	1613240	Literally...
1613240	1615240	Literally describing the area of super race.
1615240	1618240	Literally, though, the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me, Justin.
1618240	1623240	If you sent these things from a balcony and you were yelling, it's a whole different thing.
1624240	1627240	No, but that's why I wanted to be Beth and come on your show.
1627240	1637240	Because now, you know, as a result, you'll all be welcome in the little Canadian enclave that we live in.
1637240	1639240	That sounds nice. It sounds French.
1639240	1643240	You guys have no idea how fucked we are as a human race.
1644240	1646240	We're so...
1646240	1648240	Figulity, figulity, fucked.
1648240	1650240	Sarah, you gotta look him in the eyes again.
1650240	1652240	That's the only way to talk him off the edge. There you go.
1652240	1653240	That's the only...
1653240	1660240	There should be a special window above the internet where there's just eye contact with a woman who would solve every argument.
1661240	1664240	There's only one thing we can do.
1664240	1667240	It's the Canadian women, because the Canadians are very nice.
1667240	1670240	There's only one thing we can do to fight the aliens when they get here.
1670240	1672240	And that's...
1672240	1675240	Play this song on our iPads and iPhones.
1688240	1692240	It should be said that none of this pedal one is being drunk at this point.
1693240	1695240	These bottles are all set.
1698240	1700240	Has that been 45 minutes?
1700240	1702240	Not even close. We have another hour to go.
1703240	1704240	That doesn't even make sense.
1704240	1707240	We're at 8.39 then. We're at 8.39.
1707240	1709240	Is it safe to pour this ice into my...
1710240	1711240	I don't know.
1711240	1712240	Okay, well then...
1712240	1713240	That's not really ice.
1713240	1715240	John Oliver, I have some questions for you.
1715240	1716240	Let's talk to John and...
1716240	1718240	Hello?
1718240	1722240	Hey, do all American people sound like cowboys to you?
1724240	1727240	Even if they're not cowboys? Even if they're from New York?
1727240	1730240	There's a polite answer to that, and there's an honest answer.
1733240	1734240	I don't know which one I want.
1734240	1738240	Well, you have a cowboy-ish-esque...
1738240	1739240	A twang.
1739240	1742240	A twang. There's a hue. There's a verbal hue.
1742240	1744240	Do you do an American accent?
1744240	1745240	Yeah.
1745240	1749240	John, how good are you at regional American accents?
1749240	1753240	Let's start easy, because you work in New York a lot.
1753240	1754240	Let's do a good...
1754240	1756240	Get the fuck out of here.
1758240	1759240	Let me get a coffee.
1759240	1760240	Nobody tell him.
1760240	1761240	Let me get a coffee.
1763240	1764240	Let me get a coffee.
1764240	1766240	They are walking to you, asshole.
1766240	1768240	Hey, hey, Kaczynski. Hey.
1768240	1770240	I'm working on a case.
1770240	1771240	All right, now...
1771240	1773240	Let's move west.
1773240	1776240	That's the most British accent I've ever heard of my life.
1777240	1779240	Hey, Kaczynski.
1779240	1781240	Oh, working on a case, I...
1781240	1782240	Hey, Governor.
1782240	1785240	Oh, the case of the missing team.
1787240	1789240	Oh, Governor.
1789240	1791240	All right, let's go.
1791240	1794240	Python would do sketches where they would talk like Americans.
1794240	1797240	They had to, like, really aim towards Texas...
1797240	1798240	Yeah.
1798240	1799240	...in order to really nail it.
1799240	1801240	All right, so, John, let's go to Chicago.
1801240	1803240	Give me some Chicago.
1803240	1804240	Chicago?
1804240	1805240	Yeah.
1805240	1806240	How do they sound?
1806240	1808240	Okay, all right, fair enough.
1808240	1810240	I'll give you a thing.
1810240	1814240	Oh, boy, the bears are really doing real good.
1814240	1816240	That was horrible, but...
1816240	1818240	Oh, I sure love my cubs.
1818240	1820240	Oh.
1820240	1822240	That's good.
1822240	1823240	You just...
1823240	1826240	Maybe catch the Black Hawks.
1826240	1827240	I like that.
1827240	1829240	Hey, there's something interesting.
1829240	1831240	It's a good old hockey game.
1831240	1835240	It's the best game you can name.
1835240	1836240	That guy...
1836240	1837240	Norm!
1837240	1838240	That guy needs to be on a car.
1838240	1840240	Sarah, where in Canada are you from?
1840240	1841240	Vancouver.
1841240	1842240	Vancouver.
1842240	1844240	Okay, so give me, like, Deep South America.
1844240	1845240	Deep South?
1845240	1846240	Yeah, like Southern...
1846240	1848240	Can I give you, like, Deep North Canada or something?
1848240	1849240	No, no, no.
1849240	1850240	Southern America.
1850240	1851240	Southern America.
1851240	1852240	Ooh.
1852240	1853240	Uh...
1853240	1855240	Y'all...
1855240	1857240	That's already better than anything I did.
1857240	1858240	That's perfect.
1858240	1859240	Y'all.
1859240	1861240	All right, Dan, you do...
1861240	1862240	Chinese.
1862240	1863240	Chinese.
1863240	1864240	Chinese.
1864240	1868240	But not, like, racist-y, just, like, really, like, earnest and, like...
1868240	1869240	Now, here...
1869240	1871240	Really, like, be a Chinese person.
1871240	1873240	Like, don't make fun of them.
1873240	1874240	Be one.
1874240	1875240	Become a Chinese person.
1875240	1878240	Get out of the way of my tank.
1880240	1881240	Actually, you know what?
1881240	1882240	Why am I doing that guy?
1882240	1883240	I'm gonna do the other guy.
1883240	1884240	Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.
1884240	1886240	This tank is bad!
1886240	1888240	I'm not even gonna put down my bag!
1888240	1890240	We shouldn't be running over Americans!
1890240	1893240	Don't try to steer the tank around me!
1894240	1895240	I'm the tank guy.
1895240	1896240	The Tiananmen Square tank guy.
1896240	1898240	Oh, oh, oh, Jesus Christ.
1898240	1899240	You guys didn't...
1899240	1900240	I didn't even catch it.
1900240	1903240	I tried to avoid the obvious fucking racism trap you guys set for me.
1903240	1904240	Sorry.
1904240	1905240	Sorry about that.
1905240	1906240	Whatever happened to Tank Man?
1906240	1908240	Somebody asked me to do a really racist voice.
1908240	1911240	Justin, Justin, Justin, the Philippines are in the news.
1911240	1912240	Give me some Philippines.
1912240	1913240	Oh, boy, here we go.
1913240	1916240	All right, ladies and gentlemen, the Philippines.
1916240	1919240	But I'm gonna do a guy who, like, lived on a mountain
1919240	1921240	and was totally, like, super rich
1921240	1925240	and didn't get affected by the thing that happened.
1925240	1926240	All right.
1926240	1927240	Oh, boy, I'm...
1927240	1931240	Justin, can I just jump in and give you...
1933240	1937240	Just give you an opportunity not to do this.
1938240	1940240	Because there's a...
1940240	1943240	You're facing a fork in the road,
1943240	1945240	and you've turned one way,
1945240	1947240	and I just want to touch you on the shoulder
1947240	1950240	and know that I did all I could.
1951240	1953240	I was gonna make him really, like, sympathetic to the...
1953240	1957240	I don't know whether you were gonna make him as sympathetic as you were trying.
1957240	1958240	All right.
1958240	1960240	Give me another race, come on.
1960240	1961240	Give me another race!
1961240	1962240	Just give me a race!
1962240	1963240	Give me a race!
1963240	1964240	Give me a race!
1964240	1965240	Justin.
1965240	1966240	Give me a race.
1966240	1968240	Justin, give me your best John Oliver impression.
1968240	1969240	Me?
1970240	1971240	Hello, Governor.
1971240	1973240	I'm John Oliver.
1973240	1977240	Today we're going to be talking about a lot of stuff.
1977240	1979240	It's very Australian-y, isn't it?
1979240	1982240	I'm John Oliver, and I'm the ball of my journalist,
1982240	1983240	and I have glasses.
1983240	1984240	There you go.
1984240	1985240	That's good.
1985240	1986240	The alien got it.
1986240	1988240	You could never do John Oliver justice.
1988240	1990240	I'm so much happier that you did that
1990240	1992240	rather than your Philippine billionaire.
1992240	1994240	But can I tell you the truth?
1994240	1998240	Which, at the best of times, would have been misjudged
1998240	2001240	at what is technically the worst of times.
2002240	2007240	You have no idea what the rich Philippine guy would have said.
2007240	2008240	All right, Justin.
2008240	2009240	I can do French Canadian.
2009240	2010240	Can I...
2010240	2011240	Bro, hold on.
2011240	2012240	Let's hear some que bécois.
2012240	2015240	I grew up all of my classes in French, so yes.
2015240	2016240	Really?
2016240	2017240	All of my teachers were que bécois.
2017240	2018240	Give me some...
2018240	2019240	I'm sorry.
2019240	2020240	I'm sorry.
2020240	2021240	I'm sorry.
2021240	2022240	I'm sorry.
2022240	2023240	I'm sorry.
2023240	2024240	God.
2024240	2025240	Sorry.
2025240	2026240	Oh, my God.
2026240	2027240	Sorry, and your clique.
2027240	2029240	You got to shut your mouth, because otherwise,
2029240	2031240	I'm going to give you time out for all of that one
2031240	2032240	and that one and that one.
2032240	2033240	Would they hate you in that class?
2033240	2034240	Would they, like, get their, like...
2034240	2038240	Madame Modé Thompson had the fork knife and spoon mobile,
2038240	2039240	and she would...
2039240	2042240	If you are good in the class, you get to go and take the fork,
2042240	2044240	and you get to whack that one.
2044240	2047240	But if not, you don't get to be the one to do that.
2047240	2049240	And then she'd take the old big film canister
2049240	2052240	and smack it on the desk, on your desk,
2052240	2054240	and it'd scare the shit out of you.
2056240	2057240	It's a beautiful language.
2057240	2058240	It really is.
2058240	2059240	It's almost as beautiful as German,
2059240	2062240	which is where I went after school to Fra Colbeau.
2062240	2063240	What?
2064240	2065240	I'm not mad at her!
2065240	2068240	I'm just telling her that she can't be late anymore!
2068240	2069240	And I'd be like, well, you look mad.
2069240	2070240	You look really...
2070240	2072240	Hey, Sarah, how come all the Canadian...
2072240	2073240	What do you call them?
2073240	2074240	Provinces?
2074240	2075240	Provinces, we call them, yeah.
2075240	2078240	The Italians are so much straighter than in America.
2079240	2081240	Isn't it older up there?
2081240	2083240	Didn't we get there first?
2083240	2084240	Yes, yes.
2084240	2085240	How come...
2085240	2086240	It's a laser straight up there.
2086240	2087240	It's much older.
2087240	2089240	Like every place is Colorado.
2089240	2091240	Yeah, we are much older.
2091240	2093240	Why do they call them provinces, too?
2093240	2094240	Also, Dan, Dan, that.
2094240	2095240	We have a little...
2095240	2096240	In the middle of Canada, it doesn't matter,
2096240	2097240	because it's all flats.
2097240	2098240	It's exactly the same.
2098240	2099240	But you can draw lines for that.
2099240	2100240	Oh, so it's easier to...
2100240	2101240	Oh.
2101240	2102240	There's a lot of...
2102240	2103240	There's a lot of...
2103240	2104240	There's a lot of...
2104240	2106240	There's a lot of translate that I didn't know until I got...
2106240	2107240	Provinences.
2107240	2108240	Provinences.
2108240	2109240	Provinences.
2109240	2110240	That I got down here like...
2110240	2112240	Garborator and toque.
2112240	2113240	What?
2113240	2114240	And...
2114240	2115240	Who?
2115240	2116240	Carcade and seawall.
2116240	2117240	These sounds racist.
2117240	2118240	These are just your friends from high school.
2118240	2119240	Yeah.
2119240	2120240	I had a pretty awesome...
2120240	2121240	Shit stick.
2121240	2122240	Forehead.
2122240	2124240	Fork knuckle.
2124240	2126240	Dick, dick, dick, dick.
2126240	2127240	Just dick.
2127240	2128240	Just dick.
2128240	2129240	Just dick.
2129240	2130240	Gloomy.
2130240	2131240	Which actually translates perfectly.
2131240	2132240	Garborator.
2132240	2133240	Garborator.
2133240	2134240	That's a garbage disposal.
2134240	2136240	And a parkade is a parking structure.
2136240	2139240	What is the equivalent of moving to Canada tomorrow?
2139240	2141240	Do you have alderman or ombudsman?
2141240	2145240	What is the lowest level of political representative in Canada?
2145240	2146240	You have an ombudsman.
2146240	2149240	And then you have all the way up to...
2149240	2150240	Schmanzmann.
2150240	2151240	Schmanzmann.
2151240	2152240	Schmanzmann.
2152240	2153240	All the way up to Mr...
2153240	2154240	Ever heard of it?
2154240	2155240	All the way up to Mr. Ford.
2155240	2158240	All the way up to the Canadian president.
2158240	2159240	All the way up to...
2159240	2160240	Schmo mama.
2160240	2161240	Schmo mama.
2161240	2163240	Everything's a one-for-one analog up there.
2163240	2164240	Sarah.
2164240	2166240	I know it's not America's job to butt...
2166240	2169240	We make it our job to butt into other people's politics,
2169240	2172240	but how do you feel about Toronto's mayor currently?
2172240	2175240	I mean, he has got a lot to eat at home.
2175240	2176240	Oh, yeah.
2176240	2178240	That was my favorite one, I think.
2178240	2180240	The eating pussy line is fucking good.
2180240	2182240	Wait, what's happening with Toronto's mayor?
2182240	2184240	He smokes and cracks.
2184240	2186240	He drives drunk.
2186240	2187240	He needs some love.
2187240	2189240	He urinates in a schoolyard.
2189240	2190240	He poosmoos in the toilet.
2190240	2196240	This must be so exciting for your three prime-time Canadian talk show hosts.
2196240	2198240	Or late night...
2198240	2199240	God damn it, I fucked up a joke.
2199240	2200240	It's okay.
2200240	2203240	The only one tonight.
2203240	2204240	Don't let it...
2204240	2205240	Don't let it...
2205240	2207240	You guys have a Mary and Barry, that's what I'm hearing.
2207240	2208240	Yeah.
2208240	2210240	Your Toronto mayor is...
2210240	2211240	Yeah, he's in trouble.
2211240	2212240	Fuck.
2212240	2213240	He's in trouble.
2213240	2214240	Yeah, it's nice.
2214240	2217240	It lowers the bar for the rest of us Canadians to speak in public.
2217240	2219240	Like, tonight, I just don't have to talk about...
2219240	2220240	You don't have to smoke crack.
2220240	2221240	I don't have to smoke crack.
2221240	2222240	I just have to make sure I don't pee on anybody.
2222240	2225240	And I'm good.
2225240	2227240	Public speaking is no problem.
2227240	2230240	You know what's funny about all this is that when the grey aliens show up,
2230240	2231240	they don't give a fuck.
2231240	2233240	They're gonna shit in their mouths.
2233240	2235240	They're gonna shit in your mouths.
2235240	2236240	They're gonna shit in our mouths?
2236240	2237240	Yeah, yeah.
2237240	2240240	And you're all laughing now, but when you're strapped down
2240240	2243240	and your eyes are peeled open and they're bent over
2243240	2244240	and shitting in your mouth...
2244240	2245240	Can you just honestly...
2245240	2249240	I think even the grey aliens with their different moral code
2249240	2253240	would recognize that Toronto's mayor has a serious drug problem
2253240	2257240	and is not particularly fit for office or indeed sitting down.
2257240	2259240	Justin, how old are you?
2259240	2260240	Me?
2260240	2261240	Yeah.
2261240	2262240	I'm 33 years old.
2262240	2264240	And every year I get closer to the inevitable death
2264240	2265240	that we all will face.
2265240	2267240	I want you all to fucking think about that tonight
2267240	2268240	when you're going to sleep.
2268240	2269240	We're all gonna die.
2269240	2270240	There's nothing you can do about it.
2270240	2272240	And what the fuck happens after that?
2272240	2273240	Go ahead.
2273240	2274240	What was your question?
2275240	2277240	My question was this.
2277240	2279240	Anyway, sleep well, children.
2280240	2281240	My question was...
2281240	2282240	I do.
2282240	2285240	I've heard it said that schizophrenia either comes on early
2285240	2288240	or around the late 30s or 40 years old.
2288240	2289240	I think I might be out of the window.
2289240	2290240	I think I'm out of the window.
2290240	2294240	No, no, because I think you might be right in prime time, schizophrenia.
2294240	2296240	Like, maybe you've just lost your fucking mind.
2296240	2297240	I think I'm totally in the window.
2297240	2298240	Huh?
2298240	2299240	I'll tell you what.
2299240	2301240	If this turns out to be that I'm actually in a padded cell
2301240	2304240	in a straight jacket and I'm just talking to myself right now,
2304240	2306240	then I'm totally schizophrenic.
2306240	2309240	But if I'm really in front of a bunch of people with lights on me
2309240	2312240	and Dan Harmon's right there and John Oliver and Sarah Chalk
2312240	2313240	and you're there, then I'm not...
2313240	2314240	I can't be schizophrenic.
2314240	2315240	If that's the case...
2315240	2316240	I'm not saying...
2316240	2317240	I'm not here.
2318240	2319240	Holy...
2319240	2321240	John Oliver died four years ago.
2322240	2324240	Flanagan killed him.
2324240	2326240	Elvis Presley's right over there, right?
2326240	2328240	I mean, right?
2328240	2329240	No, no.
2329240	2332240	You're psychotic if you're in a different place.
2332240	2334240	If you're schizophrenic, you could just think...
2334240	2336240	That's just making extra connections.
2336240	2340240	I hear that if you're schizophrenic, you hear audible hallucinations
2340240	2343240	and you see shit and then you want to kill people.
2343240	2345240	There was this kid that used to go to the card shop
2345240	2347240	that I used to go buy my comics at
2347240	2351240	and he was always there playing magic and Pokemon cards with people
2351240	2354240	and then one week he just wasn't there and the shop was kind of...
2354240	2358240	You know, everyone was real quiet and it was sort of depressing.
2358240	2360240	And I asked the guy as I was checking out...
2360240	2362240	The exits are two to the left.
2362240	2364240	I asked the guy...
2364240	2366240	I said, hey, where's Jimmy at?
2366240	2369240	You know, he's usually here every week when I pull in and buy my comics
2369240	2371240	and he's like, yeah, he was schizo
2371240	2374240	and he killed his fucking grandmother that he lived with.
2374240	2376240	He fucking gouged her eyeballs out
2376240	2379240	because she made him stop taking his meds.
2379240	2382240	That's the week that I was convinced that story was going to end well.
2382240	2386240	It's a true story, let me tell you about it.
2386240	2389240	It's a true story.
2389240	2392240	That's what happened.
2392240	2395240	And I'll tell you the other thing, I still bought my comics.
2395240	2397240	This is how I reacted to hearing that news.
2397240	2398240	I swear to God this is true.
2398240	2401240	I'll take an extra issue of Watchmen.
2401240	2402240	Kind of.
2402240	2404240	I was like, oh, wow, that's...
2404240	2405240	In that case.
2405240	2406240	See ya.
2406240	2407240	That's what I did.
2407240	2408240	I said, all right, well...
2408240	2411240	I will give Amazing Spider-Man another try.
2411240	2413240	Spider-Man 2032, the future.
2413240	2415240	Oh, he's amazing now?
2416240	2418240	Three dollars, please.
2418240	2422240	Oh, my God, the girl he's fucking got dark brown hair?
2422240	2423240	Oh, sold.
2423240	2425240	I hated redheads.
2425240	2427240	I can't wait to see this fucking cartoon.
2427240	2429240	Yeah, are we... are you guys ready?
2429240	2433240	Have we run up the goddamn meter?
2433240	2436240	Have we driven this taxi cab around the block?
2436240	2437240	Perfect segue.
2437240	2438240	Anyway, I think you have a clip.
2438240	2444240	Are you guys ready to see the world premiere issue of Rick and Morty?
2444240	2446240	The mind of this man, which is now going to seem...
2446240	2447240	This man, too.
2447240	2449240	...disappointingly conventional.
2451240	2454240	Let's thank Sarah Chuck, John Oliver, and Justin Roanver coming up.
2454240	2455240	Thank you.
2459240	2462240	Enjoy two episodes of Rick and Morty.
2462240	2464240	If you're listening in the podcast world,
2464240	2468240	you're just going to have to tune into Adult Swim on December something.
2468240	2473240	December 2nd, December 2nd, and then like seven days after that, you know?
2473240	2474240	Like, I don't know.
2474240	2477240	And, hey, as long as there's at least 500 people listening,
2477240	2480240	community premieres January 2nd.
2480240	2482240	February 2nd.
2482240	2483240	Isn't it February?
2483240	2484240	No, it's January.
2484240	2486240	Oh, it is? Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I fucked up.
2486240	2488240	I may have just jumbled our numbers.
2488240	2489240	Sit down, everybody.
2489240	2492240	A screening of Rick and Morty is coming right up.
2492240	2493240	Are we... are we...
2493240	2495240	Sit down, Justin. You're done.
2497240	2498240	Harmon's going to make himself a drink.
2498240	2500240	Hey, do it.
2500240	2502240	All right.
2502240	2505240	Stay close, everybody. The premieres coming right up.
