0	8000	From Hollywood, California, nearing the end of our Meltdown Comics run.
8000	12000	It's sad, again, it might be the beginning of a whole new thing.
12000	16000	Nonetheless, Harmon Town is now in session.
16000	25000	Filling in for Spencer Crittenden and Rob Schwab.
30000	44000	Picture Table Clap, Picture Table Clap.
44000	55000	Let's bring out our mayor, shall we, Dan Harmon.
55000	58000	Are you alright?
59000	61000	I just murdered a guy's toes.
61000	64000	I think it's our protest mentor, isn't it?
64000	67000	We're talking to you about protesting, and then I never protested anything.
67000	70000	No, I'm spitting all over you. It's vodka.
70000	73000	Bad start, bad start.
73000	76000	Take charge, Harmon. Fuck you people.
76000	79000	Don't show weakness. What is this? I want to see in the back.
79000	82000	Wait, are these new glasses you're wearing?
82000	84000	They're one of two pairs of glasses I got.
85000	88000	Those look like new glasses, Dan.
88000	92000	A lot of you guys, some of you don't need glasses.
92000	95000	A lot of you do. You're 25, I always assume.
95000	99000	I imagine a massive, like, disproportionate amount.
99000	101000	I'm 46.
108000	110000	Spencer can't make it.
110000	116000	Okay, uh, could I just have an empty chair?
116000	119000	I don't know, it feels wrong.
119000	123000	Fuck, who's in my living room right now?
123000	128000	Oh, okay, fine.
128000	133000	Now you know the back story.
133000	138000	She's outside the window.
138000	141000	A lot of you are just straight up myopic or something like you.
141000	143000	You have bad eyes. You were born with them.
143000	146000	We've been tampering with evolution for a while.
146000	148000	I mean, you don't get, you don't...
148000	154000	What does your eyesight do to get you non-reproductively viable in the first world empire?
154000	158000	I mean, which has been raging for long enough to spread a lot of bad eyesight.
158000	160000	How did you know when a caveman's eyes went bad?
160000	163000	A caveman didn't live till the past 20 anyway.
163000	167000	What I'm saying is, my audience, like, you're probably born with bad eyes.
167000	170000	You're Harman fans.
170000	178000	I, 2020, solid gold, carrot, night vision, fucking, like, see-through walls all the time.
178000	180000	I have what's called astigmatism.
180000	183000	My eyeballs aren't perfectly round. Whoop-dee-doo.
183000	188000	So the next time you're telling me white privilege, fuck you.
188000	190000	There's some shit you gotta deal with.
190000	192000	My eyeballs are not perfectly round.
192000	198000	Apparently, that means as I get older, now I'm 44, so as I get older now,
198000	203000	my vision is getting worse from both ends.
203000	205000	So I'm not blowing anyone's mind with this.
205000	206000	It's just frustrating.
206000	208000	It's like a Louis C.K. bit or something.
208000	210000	You just have this conversation with an optometrist.
210000	212000	You just go, like, so what are you saying?
212000	213000	They go, like, look at this.
213000	214000	Now look at that with the lenses.
214000	216000	And they go, okay, so here's the thing.
216000	219000	The reason your phone's blurry is because you can't see some stuff up close.
220000	224000	The reason the sign's blurry far away is because some stuff really far away.
224000	227000	So you want two pairs of glasses?
227000	228000	Bad eyesight.
228000	229000	What? Excuse me, what?
229000	230000	Bad eyesight.
230000	232000	Jesus Christ.
232000	235000	Sounds like you're talking about some bad eyesight.
235000	242000	What's amazing, you guys, no spoilers, but this is all elaborate me undies ad.
244000	247000	So I'm wearing, I decided, I don't know why.
247000	248000	I got two pairs of glasses.
248000	249000	One's for reading.
249000	250000	So I can look at my phone.
250000	255000	These are for, literally, the purpose of these is so that I can read to Cody
255000	260000	when she's taking her contacts out, the forensic files, summaries on the TV.
260000	264000	That's the only use that these have, but I've been wearing them around
264000	267000	because I'm told by some people, like, well, you're supposed to wear them
267000	269000	so that your eyes adjust.
269000	270000	I don't want my eye.
270000	271000	I don't, I hate it.
271000	273000	So, like, $300 frames.
273000	276000	They're Johnny Varvatos.
276000	279000	Johnny Varvatos?
279000	280000	The very one.
280000	281000	Is he out?
281000	284000	Did he fucking make bail?
284000	286000	Hey, Johnny.
286000	287000	Hey, Johnny man.
287000	288000	Hey, Johnny.
288000	291000	I think he's the last Ramon, right?
291000	292000	Hey.
292000	293000	Hey, Johnny.
293000	295000	Johnny my man, Johnny.
295000	296000	Want an apple?
296000	297000	Hey, Johnny.
297000	299000	Come over and get some apples, Johnny.
299000	302000	Johnny, free apples for Johnny Varvatos.
302000	305000	Everybody.
305000	306000	All right, well...
306000	307000	Where are the special glasses?
307000	308000	Why are you drinking from the red solo cup?
308000	310000	I put them on my shirt because I don't need them.
310000	311000	No, no, no.
311000	314000	Your red, your solo cup, your Jane Cook glasses.
314000	315000	Oh, those glasses.
315000	316000	Oh.
316000	317000	Yeah.
317000	318000	Yeah, well, where were those?
318000	319000	I don't know.
319000	320000	Oh, maybe they were stolen.
320000	321000	Start a Kickstarter.
321000	322000	I don't know.
322000	323000	I don't know where they are.
323000	324000	We'll find out.
324000	325000	They're sealed.
325000	328000	They're being scuttled out.
328000	329000	A lot of fuck-ups.
329000	331000	That's why we're leaving.
332000	336000	Well, for the next couple weeks, we are going to...
336000	337000	It's not tonight.
337000	339000	There's nothing special tonight.
339000	340000	I'm sorry.
340000	341000	I keep spitting.
341000	342000	I'm sorry.
342000	343000	There's gobs of spit.
343000	345000	They don't sit there because they don't want to get spit on.
345000	346000	They know this.
346000	347000	Well, but it's not...
347000	348000	They don't know...
348000	353000	I don't want to derail the show, but if anybody has a small pair of scissors...
353000	355000	We've done this before.
355000	356000	We did it in San Francisco.
356000	359000	We just want to do a small tracheotomy.
359000	360000	Just the...
360000	363000	Just the walrus hairs coming out of it.
363000	365000	Well, could Paul the whip guy in the front row...
365000	368000	Can you whip his mustache hairs off?
368000	369000	No.
369000	370000	No, it's not.
370000	371000	Anybody...
371000	372000	I got mine.
372000	374000	Does anybody have mustache scissors on them?
374000	377000	I got my ears and nose wax today.
377000	379000	Because it's going to keep happening otherwise.
379000	381000	Because I drink and then it...
381000	383000	That won't work.
383000	384000	Any takers?
390000	391000	All right.
391000	392000	Or a straw.
392000	393000	Or a match.
393000	394000	A straw.
394000	395000	A match.
395000	396000	A knife.
396000	397000	All right.
397000	400000	Well, let's keep the show rolling.
400000	403000	Let's keep it rolling.
403000	404000	All right.
404000	406000	So, I want to...
406000	409000	What happened with United Airlines today?
409000	412000	Something happened where there was like a family that was barred from getting on.
412000	416000	All I know is I saw Twitter lineup and the end result of what I saw was it seemed like
416000	417000	America...
417000	422000	American parents were divided down the middle on how old their daughters should be
422000	425000	before they could be regarded as too hot to get on a plane.
425000	426000	What?
426000	427000	No, it was...
427000	431000	I saw a headline that said two women were not allowed on because of leggings.
431000	433000	But it was like employee...
433000	436000	They were pass passengers, which meant that they were employees of United.
436000	438000	They were flying for free because they were friends of the company or something.
438000	441000	So, it was a more archaic dress code that they employ.
441000	445000	They have a higher standard for friends of the airline that get on the plane.
445000	449000	But it's just called everybody's attention to this weird archaic thing.
449000	453000	Like in this random incident, really, you're talking about probably a short fuse blown
453000	456000	by somebody who's just like...
456000	458000	Close your legs, Missy.
458000	464000	If we haven't seen disgusting shit on an airplane by now, what country are we living in?
464000	468000	Gerard de Pardoux peed in first class.
468000	469000	I would like...
469000	471000	He's not in Guantanamo right now.
471000	475000	I would like to open the books about what's allowed on an airplane
475000	479000	as far as fashion is concerned and things like that.
479000	481000	But I don't want to...
481000	483000	Maybe your feet are really tired.
483000	486000	I don't want to tell one gross person don't take off your shoes.
486000	489000	Even though I don't want to look at your feet at the same time.
489000	490000	I don't know.
490000	491000	Airplanes are a hard place to be.
491000	492000	Some lady put her feet on your head.
492000	493000	One thing's for sure.
493000	496000	We don't all look like a Mormon choir when we get on the plane.
496000	504000	Everybody puts on their sweatpants and yoga pants and hats and leg braces.
504000	509000	I transform into a pickup.
509000	510000	Are you Ironhide?
510000	515000	I'm part of a larger set of toys that you can only get at Christmas.
515000	517000	It's like 35 bucks for...
517000	520000	There's me and there's a helicopter and we all attach to the airplane.
520000	521000	It's not cool like Voltron.
521000	523000	It doesn't turn into a robot.
523000	529000	But it turns into a big giant clunky airplane that has a pickup truck on the top.
529000	531000	My parents are divorced.
531000	534000	It's a bad Christmas.
534000	537000	This is just 80's humor.
537000	539000	Alright, let's bring up Brandon Johnson.
539000	541000	Yay!
542000	552000	If you need a suit, come to Johnny Paul Vitals.
552000	556000	Get your suit down here at Johnny Paul Vitals.
556000	559000	Johnny Paul Vitals!
559000	561000	Free apples.
561000	564000	But there are a lot of people in my Twitter feed.
564000	565000	There are people arguing.
565000	566000	They're going like...
566000	567000	But she was 10 years old.
567000	568000	That's not a teenager.
568000	569000	But it was like the original thing.
570000	571000	And then there were people posting...
571000	573000	I saw a guy post a picture of his 10-year-old daughter going...
573000	575000	Here's my 10-year-old daughter in leggings.
575000	577000	Is that obscene?
577000	580000	And I was like, alright, slow down.
580000	581000	Creepy Uncle Mark.
581000	583000	That's not your daughter.
583000	590000	It's just like the sound of permission rang out to a certain demo.
590000	593000	They say, well, what if they're 10 years old and they're too sexy for leggings?
593000	596000	Then whoa!
596000	598000	You know in America, we're sort of like, would I fuck it?
598000	601000	I don't care.
601000	604000	But it's kind of like...
604000	607000	Obviously you would not fuck that joke.
607000	608000	That joke is ugly.
608000	610000	But there is that really weird thing.
610000	613000	If you put that joke in some leggings, though.
613000	621000	One of my favorite non-pornographic little areas I visit on YouTube,
621000	628000	which is hosiery reviews for and by women.
628000	631000	I'm sure it is.
631000	634000	I don't think a lot of their audience is women.
634000	636000	But it's not...
636000	643000	You have to have an extreme leg foot, specifically in hosiery fetish.
643000	646000	The rules of pornography are really weird.
646000	648000	Famously, they're totally subjective.
648000	650000	And YouTube pulled...
650000	652000	It's just about who complains about what.
652000	656000	All of a sudden, one day, legs lavish was shut down.
656000	661000	I just think that's a really funny thing to be simultaneously on the side of purity
661000	665000	and basically confessing that you recognize something as sexual.
665000	666000	It's its own kink.
666000	670000	Whoever smelt it dealt it should definitely apply to pornography.
670000	673000	Because the Supreme Court judge famously said,
673000	677000	I don't know pornography, but I know it when I see it.
677000	678000	And that's fair enough.
678000	682000	That's probably the most judicial thing you can say when you're policing something like pornography.
682000	686000	That was the famous case of smelting versus dealting.
686000	690000	Well, isn't that where the Dalmatian video from...
690000	694000	He got shut down because of the same thing.
694000	696000	And it wasn't because of us, I don't think.
696000	698000	It wasn't because we drew attention to it.
698000	699000	It was shut down before that.
699000	701000	Legs lavish?
701000	703000	It's hosiery reviews for women by women.
703000	705000	Are the legs...
705000	710000	The legs are lavished in hosiery, which they can be.
710000	713000	They're British.
713000	715000	Are the legs lavishing things?
715000	719000	No, their legs are being lavished with high quality hosiery.
719000	722000	And they're telling you whether or not you should buy them.
722000	725000	Harmon used to write for a pimp site.
725000	729000	His legs are lavished with hosiery.
729000	733000	A coutremont, if you will.
733000	741000	I subscribe to Brandon's porn site called Upscale Nation of Islam.
741000	743000	For the ladies.
743000	745000	Why just have one small clip on bow tie?
745000	749000	Why not have better bow ties?
749000	756000	We call it bean pies made by these thighs.
756000	758000	All your Muslim needs.
758000	763000	Are you out there trying to stop the man, but you don't want to get arrested?
763000	769000	This tasteful librarian from the 30s will teach you how.
769000	774000	Yes, I ain't down for this shit, but I also might work at Brooks Brothers.
774000	777000	We can't always be like, you know, British rock cool.
777000	779000	Some of us...
779000	781000	That's a compliment, goddamn it.
781000	784000	Man, y'all look tricky tonight.
784000	787000	I knew this bow tie was a failure.
787000	790000	But it's one of those rare nights where you and I are both dressed up.
790000	793000	Sometimes it's usually one or the other.
793000	800000	Yeah, I usually wear an orange suit, jumpsuit, big footies.
800000	804000	I see you picking up trash on that one-on-one.
804000	806000	But you are always stellarly dressed.
806000	810000	Round of applause for Jeff Davis.
810000	814000	That's what you do right before you put somebody down.
814000	817000	Because queers need love.
817000	820000	That was like a classic roast setup.
820000	824000	Back when it was funny to be queer.
824000	827000	You can order the roast videos.
827000	831000	Another thing that's been phased out that you kids should be grateful for.
831000	835000	Sometimes at the drawing room you take a little trip back in time socially.
835000	841000	I was told I was a lucky guy today because I was with my girlfriend.
842000	847000	And the millennials may not hear you're a lucky guy as much.
847000	851000	It means I want to fuck your girlfriend in front of you.
851000	854000	And you're too ugly to fuck her.
854000	860000	Congratulations on the acquisition of something out of your league.
860000	865000	It kind of just offends everybody except possibly, hypothetically,
865000	869000	a woman with incredibly low self-esteem who might be standing there
869000	874000	being told that the man she's currently fucking is luckier than the man
874000	879000	who's saying to the other man in front of her, I'd like to fuck her.
879000	881000	What was your response?
881000	884000	Thank you.
884000	888000	She has her moments.
888000	904000	Yeah, every day of my life is the first eight minutes of a horror movie set in the Appalachians.
904000	908000	I just don't want anyone to eat me or beat me up.
908000	914000	I just want directions to the next gas station so I can keep that movie from crossing the threshold.
915000	920000	You're a lucky guy. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Another drink, please.
920000	927000	Just keep making TV. They won't eat you.
927000	931000	I am a lucky guy. I am a fucking lucky guy.
931000	937000	You'd have to be less lucky than me to be offended quickly enough to be a gentleman and go,
937000	940000	excuse me, sir. I mean, who's going to take somebody to school?
940000	943000	I mean, he was 70.
943000	946000	We're doing the cold open to get out right now, by the way.
946000	949000	Well, I don't know. I'm the only person that hasn't seen get out yet.
949000	953000	I want to start like a little group.
953000	957000	Well, they hate you for not having seen it.
957000	960000	They're actually mad that you haven't seen it.
960000	964000	But my screener from Moonlight came and I watched it right away.
964000	969000	You will watch a man jerk off another man.
969000	977000	But you will not watch a man escape to freedom.
977000	979000	He's got you. He's got you there.
979000	981000	Because there's no screener.
981000	984000	He's got you there.
984000	987000	He's right.
987000	988000	Enjoy your privilege.
988000	990000	Yep.
990000	992000	Enjoy your privilege.
992000	994000	I would say Moonlight definitely.
994000	996000	Wait, what one best director?
997000	999000	La La Land. See, that's a big step.
999000	1002000	I didn't see La La Land. I'm white enough.
1002000	1007000	I've seen the art for it and I just know that's going to make me golf.
1007000	1013000	I don't need that in my life.
1013000	1017000	I'm still trying to get Moulin Rouge out of my ear.
1017000	1023000	But I thought that Moonlight was brilliantly directed.
1023000	1025000	I don't know from La La Land.
1025000	1028000	I guess maybe it's hard to direct people going to La La Land and stuff.
1028000	1035000	But it is definitely like this was directed well.
1035000	1037000	It kind of screams off of Moonlight.
1037000	1042000	I have a pet peeve about slice of life movies because I work so hard all day
1042000	1044000	trying to figure out what should happen next.
1044000	1048000	And then when shit just kind of lays out and you leave the movie going,
1048000	1049000	that was well directed.
1049000	1051000	There's a part of me, the writer part of me is like,
1051000	1053000	you better not give the best picture.
1053000	1056000	Because it takes more. You've got to do that.
1056000	1062000	But it was like the patience and where the camera was and also the more.
1062000	1064000	Yeah, whatever. I'm not going to tell you why Moonlight was good.
1064000	1066000	What the fuck am I doing?
1066000	1068000	I was impressed though.
1068000	1072000	It passed like this incredible litmus test because I hit the wrong button
1072000	1077000	and I think my dog sitter might have put Moonlight in the Blu-ray player.
1077000	1082000	That's why I was like half drunk and I hit a button and Moonlight started playing.
1082000	1084000	I had no idea what the fuck it was.
1084000	1089000	I had one sock on and was like...
1089000	1092000	You accidentally watched Moonlight.
1092000	1094000	Yeah, like seven minutes in.
1094000	1097000	I think this is Moonlight.
1097000	1105000	He accidentally watched Moonlight because his dog sitter might have put it in the...
1105000	1110000	What's it going to take to get him to see Get Out?
1110000	1114000	I don't get that reference but I'm sure something terrible happened.
1114000	1118000	I got to drink a bowl of cum.
1118000	1121000	The way horror movies have been going, there's like one moment in every horror movie
1121000	1125000	and it's like, uh-oh, there's always a thing.
1125000	1128000	There's always a bowl of cum.
1128000	1133000	Don't breathe? Don't breathe has a bowl of cum in it.
1133000	1135000	Spoilers.
1135000	1138000	Wait, they can't breathe because they have a mouthful of cum?
1138000	1140000	It's not why they can't breathe.
1140000	1142000	They can't breathe because...
1142000	1144000	I can't breathe!
1144000	1146000	I can't breathe!
1146000	1150000	Sir, sir, you can't breathe.
1150000	1153000	I also didn't ask you to drink that bowl of cum.
1153000	1156000	That was for my guests.
1156000	1158000	We're supposed to be here robbing a blind man.
1158000	1162000	Why did you bring a bowl of cum?
1162000	1166000	You can breathe.
1166000	1170000	Well, now I feel stupid.
1170000	1173000	Let's go rob that blind guy's house.
1173000	1175000	Don't you think... I've heard blind people can hear better.
1175000	1178000	Well, you know what makes you real quiet.
1178000	1182000	No. Open that cooler in the back seat.
1182000	1186000	What are these... Is these three bowls of what looks like coconut milk
1186000	1188000	and what smells like paper mache?
1188000	1195000	Yeah, that's what it is.
1195000	1200000	Tastes like pineapple.
1200000	1204000	I feel so racist because I'm picturing little Asian bowls
1204000	1207000	on like beautiful ice, like a seafood buffet.
1207000	1209000	Because it's... Are you saying that's racist
1209000	1215000	because you're imagining white people cum in smaller portions?
1215000	1216000	And you're picturing...
1216000	1217000	No!
1217000	1220000	Let's settle this right now!
1220000	1223000	I'm racist. I'm picturing these little bowls.
1224000	1226000	It was the bowls.
1226000	1227000	It was the Asian bowls.
1227000	1229000	That doesn't make you racist. That makes you art department.
1229000	1232000	Yeah.
1232000	1237000	And that makes you homophobic.
1237000	1240000	When I was a kid, I had a friend named Kent who...
1240000	1243000	He was a white dude and he was a freaky ass white dude
1243000	1246000	and we were all jumping up on the mattresses
1246000	1248000	and he was like, let's get naked.
1248000	1250000	So we get snakey.
1250000	1252000	We get naked and he's like, spread your ass cheeks.
1252000	1254000	I've never seen inside a black dude's butt.
1254000	1255000	What?
1255000	1256000	At which point...
1256000	1259000	Don't act like this hasn't happened to all of us.
1259000	1261000	So at which point...
1261000	1264000	Brandon, Dan hasn't seen get out yet, so...
1268000	1270000	Spoiler alert.
1272000	1274000	I feel like I'm not even going to finish my story now.
1274000	1276000	I'm just going to leave you motherfuckers right there.
1276000	1278000	No, no, no, no, finish the story.
1278000	1279000	I'm going to walk you back.
1279000	1281000	How old were you at this point?
1281000	1283000	I was 18. No, I was...
1285000	1287000	I had to be... I was about five.
1287000	1288000	I was about five years old.
1288000	1290000	So I do my duty.
1290000	1291000	You know, I'm doing the right thing.
1291000	1292000	I'm a gentleman's.
1292000	1294000	I spread my butt cheeks.
1294000	1295000	Yes.
1295000	1297000	So I go, motherfucker, your turn.
1297000	1298000	Your turn.
1298000	1302000	So he spread his butt cheeks and he had toilet tissue stuck.
1302000	1304000	And I thought...
1304000	1306000	Don't be grossed out yet.
1308000	1309000	Hold your own.
1309000	1313000	So I thought, oh my God, if brown people poop brown,
1313000	1315000	white people must poop white.
1318000	1320000	Just like the plot of Get Out.
1325000	1328000	So you said he had white poop stuck in his white butt.
1329000	1331000	What else was I supposed to think?
1331000	1333000	I mean, the story...
1333000	1335000	Just like you're saying,
1335000	1337000	there's white poop stuck in his white butt.
1338000	1339000	It's like something...
1339000	1341000	It's like something Fred Sanford would say to somebody
1341000	1342000	to kick him off.
1342000	1344000	Get the fuck out of here!
1344000	1347000	Take your white poop and your white butt and get the fuck out!
1353000	1357000	I mean, your story asks a lot more questions than it answers.
1357000	1359000	Well, I'd like to know more about this friendship.
1359000	1361000	Not that we all didn't have...
1361000	1364000	That's what childhood happens.
1364000	1366000	And then what happened?
1366000	1368000	That's when we watched Transformers.
1369000	1371000	We continued to jump on mattresses.
1371000	1374000	But naked or did you get re-robed?
1374000	1375000	I mean, at that point I was freaked out.
1375000	1376000	We got re-robed.
1376000	1377000	No, we stayed naked.
1378000	1382000	He was like six years old, but he was playing the race card.
1382000	1384000	He said, I want to...
1384000	1387000	He made it racial because he wanted to see your butthole.
1387000	1389000	It's true. It's very early, it starts.
1389000	1390000	That's pretty villainous.
1392000	1395000	He's not saying that I think my butthole's better
1395000	1396000	than your butthole.
1396000	1400000	I guess he's a kid and he's using whatever he can use.
1400000	1403000	Don't you think he would say, I've never seen a short person's butthole.
1403000	1406000	I've never seen a blonde person's butthole.
1406000	1410000	Consciousness of race may be present in very early youth,
1410000	1413000	but it's not always sinister.
1413000	1416000	I was picturing it as like he was abusing a power dynamic.
1416000	1419000	He was like, I've never seen a black person's butthole,
1419000	1421000	so now show it to me.
1421000	1423000	Complete me!
1424000	1427000	I showed it to him and he said, you're really a lucky guy.
1430000	1432000	You're a lucky fucking guy.
1434000	1435000	Thank you.
1435000	1437000	Also, what Brandon hasn't told you,
1437000	1440000	the story takes place on the catamaran in Cancun.
1446000	1448000	I'm trying to remember...
1448000	1450000	It's a great way to look at somebody's butthole.
1451000	1454000	We showed each other our dicks a lot.
1454000	1459000	I've said that to Brian across the street when we were that age.
1459000	1462000	I don't remember what penis parties were,
1462000	1465000	but I remember telling my parents about penis parties.
1465000	1468000	I think it was just me and Brian from across the street.
1468000	1470000	We would run into the bushes.
1470000	1472000	I think we'd just pull out our junk.
1472000	1474000	What am I, a skateboarder?
1474000	1481000	What am I, a comedy central show?
1481000	1485000	Our cocks, our hard six-year-old cocks.
1485000	1488000	Tungsten fucking...
1491000	1493000	But the thing that sticks out in my memory is just telling...
1493000	1496000	We would run giggling because we thought the word penis was funny
1496000	1498000	and the alliteration and stuff and then we were like,
1498000	1500000	we just had a penis party and their parents being like,
1500000	1503000	whoa, it's the 70s, okay.
1504000	1506000	Your parents were like, so did we, but different.
1506000	1509000	Yeah, yeah, get out of here.
1509000	1513000	We were having a fondue pineapple fucking...
1513000	1517000	We were watching the match game and fucking...
1519000	1521000	Their parents were the same as they are now.
1521000	1524000	They just wore shower curtains.
1524000	1526000	Ah, the 70s.
1526000	1533000	Hey, do you guys think United should let little girls with leggings...
1533000	1536000	I don't know, okay, all right.
1536000	1542000	Oh, today is the 75th anniversary of the Flashdance reference
1542000	1548000	that you see in every fucking animated movie that nobody knows what it is.
1548000	1550000	Ask them if they know what it is.
1550000	1552000	They don't. Listen to their silence.
1552000	1555000	Every time there's a fucking animated movie that involves dancing,
1555000	1557000	an animated character will go over to a chair
1557000	1561000	and it will cut to a side view of them and they'll pull a chain and water will come down.
1561000	1566000	That is a reference to a 1930s Lumiere Brothers movie called Flashdance
1566000	1571000	that none of us, me included, have ever seen and they just keep referencing it
1571000	1574000	and because the director of those movies that you're watching are my age
1574000	1577000	and they grew up on references to that movie.
1577000	1580000	References to it. It's Flashdance.
1580000	1582000	Ha ha ha ha ha!
1582000	1586000	75th anniversary of that reference makes no fucking sense.
1586000	1589000	What did you recently see that reference in?
1589000	1594000	That sing movie, you know, there was an ad, there was like a billboard with a pig.
1594000	1596000	There's water coming down on the pig.
1596000	1599000	Nick Kroll's character.
1599000	1605000	And then I was sitting in the Rustic Inn today and Shrek 9 was playing over someone's shoulder
1605000	1608000	and I saw a chipmunk who was like, I love these cookies,
1608000	1611000	and they all do a dance about them and then water came down.
1611000	1615000	I don't know what Shrek it was. They probably do it in every Shrek.
1615000	1618000	75th anniversary of that bit.
1618000	1622000	Do you think like the last Shrek was doing references to the first Shrek?
1622000	1624000	Could be. Don't know.
1624000	1626000	Can't tell my Shrek's apart.
1626000	1629000	Why was that bad? I got groaned.
1629000	1632000	Oh God. What happened?
1632000	1635000	I've never seen a Shrek. I've never seen the Shreks.
1635000	1639000	That's not the first one. I've seen.
1639000	1643000	It's no get out.
1643000	1650000	I watched Dead Ringers today with Jeremy Irons.
1650000	1652000	He came over?
1652000	1656000	No.
1656000	1659000	Me and Jeremy Irons.
1659000	1662000	Wait, why didn't you invite me over too?
1662000	1666000	You just have movie dates with Jeremy Irons?
1666000	1669000	Come on, let's watch it. No, no, no, no, no.
1669000	1672000	When's the last time you've seen it? Well, it's the premiere.
1672000	1675000	There's another thing in the Shrek thing that I saw in the bar over someone's shoulder
1675000	1678000	is they were doing a walk and talk and it was like a mall
1678000	1681000	and they were walking past malls, medieval malls.
1681000	1685000	So the joke area is obviously, okay, they're in a mall,
1685000	1687000	but it's like fairy tale times.
1687000	1690000	There wasn't even three of them. There was just one that said,
1690000	1692000	Versartory.
1692000	1695000	You've got to work harder than that. You've got seven years to write these jokes.
1695000	1697000	Wait, was that Versace?
1697000	1698000	Yeah.
1698000	1700000	Versartory?
1700000	1705000	I was saying, and then the table was going like,
1705000	1708000	come on, throw it to a room and you get years.
1708000	1711000	It wasn't like it was built into the plot.
1711000	1713000	That joke is the last thing you can write.
1713000	1715000	And then we were like, okay, well, what do you do?
1715000	1718000	And I was like, forever 21.
1718000	1721000	And then Cody said forever 12.
1721000	1725000	Which is really funny. Way too funny for a Shrek movie.
1725000	1728000	Forever 12 like fucking cracked me up.
1728000	1731000	You go to a mall in medieval times. It's forever 12.
1731000	1735000	It's really, really dark and funny.
1735000	1739000	It's funny in layers. It hits you in waves how funny that is.
1739000	1742000	Forever 12.
1742000	1744000	It's so dark.
1744000	1747000	And then you're like, it's dark about consumerism.
1747000	1749000	It's dark about our youth worship.
1749000	1751000	It's dark about life expectancy.
1751000	1753000	It's dark about the last ceiling.
1753000	1756000	It's also a store that's sponsored by United Airlines.
1756000	1758000	Yeah.
1758000	1762000	I thought it was like only the 12th version of forever.
1762000	1765000	But now we're already up to forever 21.
1765000	1768000	And in 10 years, they'll be forever 31.
1768000	1772000	So that joke was funny on multiple levels.
1772000	1777000	Even to people who have maybe a little learning disability.
1777000	1782000	Kill city.
1782000	1787000	I'm sorry. I'm just trying to think of more medieval mall stores.
1787000	1789000	What?
1789000	1791000	Armorani?
1791000	1794000	Armorani. I mean, that's as good as versus archery.
1794000	1796000	Yeah.
1796000	1799000	My thing was like, I would just, you know, my bag of tricks.
1799000	1802000	I'm Dan Harmon. I would have just kept versus archery.
1802000	1804000	Done armorari.
1804000	1807000	And then the third one would have been like a wordplay clearing house.
1807000	1810000	Half off.
1810000	1812000	Going out of business.
1812000	1814000	And it's like work less hard.
1814000	1816000	Be more meta. Everyone will say you're smart.
1816000	1817000	Yeah.
1817000	1819000	You're actually just less funny.
1819000	1824000	Also, you could throw in a Johnny Varvatos.
1824000	1828000	There could be ye olde republic instead of banana republic.
1828000	1832000	Instead of the gap, maybe the gout.
1832000	1834000	The gout. The baby gout.
1834000	1836000	The baby gout.
1836000	1838000	Gout for kids.
1838000	1843000	Incredibly heavy brook stone.
1843000	1845000	Because I don't know, maybe rocks were bigger back then?
1845000	1847000	Because it's in the brook.
1847000	1850000	So it's been brook boulder, brook boulder.
1850000	1852000	And then you go home and you research erosion.
1852000	1856000	And you're like, oh, it became a stone by modern times.
1856000	1858000	Brook boulder.
1858000	1863000	What about hot dog on a tree?
1863000	1867000	Because they didn't have sick technology.
1867000	1869000	That's before access.
1869000	1874000	The second store is like Home Depot, but it's under construction.
1874000	1878000	Because they're like, we don't even have the shit to build the Home Depot.
1878000	1882000	Much less get this hot dog off a tree.
1882000	1885000	We saved this fucking movie.
1885000	1887000	This movie has no Simpson signs.
1887000	1889000	Those are the best signs in the business.
1889000	1890000	Which signs?
1890000	1891000	Simpsons.
1891000	1892000	Oh, Simpsons signs, yeah.
1892000	1894000	Well, that's got to be your low bar.
1894000	1897000	I mean, that's unfortunate for all of us.
1897000	1899000	That the Simpsons is like top of the game.
1899000	1901000	It's like, if you're going to have people walk past signs,
1901000	1904000	you better try to bring your Simpsons.
1904000	1906000	It's hard. It's not easy, folks.
1906000	1909000	Jumps is hard.
1909000	1916000	It's the shittiest complaint ever.
1916000	1917000	Jumps is hard.
1917000	1919000	Man, these jokes is hard, man.
1919000	1923000	I'm out there giving that crowd everything I got for you.
1923000	1927000	Ooh, some of this shit is sad.
1927000	1929000	Did you ever get the...
1929000	1932000	I was so bad at stand up Milwaukee.
1932000	1935000	I often, when the host would come up after me,
1935000	1937000	I'd often hear, come on, folks, keep it going.
1937000	1938000	Comedy isn't easy.
1938000	1944000	And I'd be like halfway to my seat.
1944000	1946000	Because sometimes I'd think I killed.
1946000	1949000	I was like, I don't know the difference yet.
1949000	1952000	I'm this bad because I haven't done it more than three times.
1952000	1954000	So that was the best time.
1954000	1955000	Comedy isn't easy.
1955000	1957000	Well, maybe he just wanted them to know that.
1957000	1966000	Hope that motherfucker's watching community right now.
1967000	1971000	It's canceled. It shows now.
1971000	1973000	Good night.
1973000	1975000	He can't even watch it.
1975000	1976000	Or no, Hulu bought the...
1976000	1977000	Yeah, there we go.
1977000	1980000	Hulu. Watch Hulu.
1980000	1986000	Hulu's slogan is, you're a lucky guy.
1986000	1987000	Just looking at my list.
1987000	1990000	Hulu bought the last season?
1990000	1992000	Yeah, they did. So they have them all now.
1992000	1995000	So if you go to Hulu, you can watch all the communities.
1995000	1996000	There you go.
1996000	1997000	Yeah.
1997000	1998000	Yeah.
1998000	1999000	You guys...
1999000	2000000	So, all right.
2000000	2002000	So I had a breakthrough in therapy.
2002000	2006000	Or no, I didn't yet.
2006000	2007000	But I had...
2007000	2013000	I got instructions that I think that I...
2013000	2016000	What I mean is I was told something in therapy
2016000	2019000	that I recognized as being the most important thing
2019000	2022000	to improve my life.
2022000	2024000	What is that?
2024000	2025000	But I haven't.
2025000	2030000	That's the funniest thing you've ever seen.
2030000	2031000	Oh, guys.
2031000	2033000	He looked at his phone for a minute.
2033000	2035000	Oh, I had a breakthrough in therapy.
2035000	2036000	Wait, no.
2036000	2043000	Sorry, I didn't yet.
2043000	2046000	Comedy isn't easy.
2046000	2050000	But what I mean is I got the tools now
2050000	2052000	and I need to learn how to use them.
2052000	2053000	And I walked out and I was like,
2053000	2054000	yeah, I got it, I got it.
2054000	2055000	It's the word mirror.
2055000	2057000	It's the thing that I haven't been doing.
2057000	2059000	I always thought when you talk to people,
2059000	2061000	the reason it's exhausting is because
2061000	2063000	you're putting energy into them.
2063000	2064000	So somebody goes like,
2064000	2068000	oh, my hair is important.
2068000	2070000	And then you think in your head,
2070000	2072000	you go like, you're a fucking vampire.
2072000	2076000	And it's like, how do I look at you
2076000	2078000	without feeling your soul screaming?
2079000	2083000	But that's not your job.
2083000	2086000	You don't have to give up your own energy.
2086000	2088000	You've become a mirror.
2088000	2089000	That's what you're supposed to do.
2089000	2090000	But I haven't done it yet.
2090000	2092000	I walked out going, I'm going to go try that.
2092000	2096000	And then I was like, hey.
2096000	2098000	Like someone was like, can I borrow a dollar?
2098000	2102000	And I was like, you'd like a dollar.
2102000	2104000	And then I stopped trying because the guy was like...
2104000	2105000	That's what you're supposed to do.
2105000	2106000	Just repeat what they say.
2106000	2109000	Well, you're supposed to reflect who they are.
2109000	2110000	Okay, let's try it.
2110000	2113000	But you have to put your shirt on like the other way.
2113000	2114000	Should we try it?
2114000	2116000	No, people are interested in themselves.
2116000	2117000	Everyone's, you know, they come to you.
2117000	2120000	Not me.
2120000	2123000	You're very contrarian.
2123000	2124000	That's great about you.
2124000	2125000	You're interesting.
2125000	2127000	You're interesting.
2127000	2128000	I love...
2128000	2131000	It's amazing how you interrupt.
2131000	2133000	I love your phone and your glasses.
2133000	2135000	Telling me lucky. Telling me lucky.
2136000	2137000	You're...
2137000	2140000	I saw Kate getting the mail the other day.
2140000	2141000	You're a lucky guy.
2141000	2144000	Yeah.
2144000	2145000	What?
2145000	2148000	You got a lot of mail.
2148000	2151000	Hey, Dan, my hair is very important to me.
2157000	2162000	Sounds like it.
2162000	2164000	Tell me more.
2164000	2165000	About your hair.
2165000	2167000	There's got to be more to it than that.
2167000	2168000	Just repeating.
2168000	2170000	She wasn't like telling me, don't throw...
2170000	2173000	I was just saying, it was right at the end of the session.
2173000	2175000	She's like, you know, do that thing where you're a mirror.
2175000	2177000	And I was like, wait, a mirror?
2177000	2179000	You mean like four agreements, how we're all mirrors
2179000	2181000	and smoke and light?
2181000	2187000	She's like, what the fuck? No.
2187000	2188000	Can't authorize you reading that poison.
2188000	2190000	I'm a fucking therapist.
2190000	2191000	No, she likes it.
2191000	2192000	I told her I read it.
2192000	2194000	She's like, that's fine.
2194000	2196000	She says, as long as the fifth agreement is,
2196000	2198000	you keep coming to me.
2198000	2200000	And I was like, no, the fifth agreement is
2200000	2201000	he had his son write a book.
2201000	2202000	Okay.
2202000	2203000	She's like, I heard you talk about that,
2203000	2204000	episode 300.
2204000	2205000	Okay.
2205000	2206000	I was like, you listen to the show?
2206000	2207000	She's like, yeah.
2207000	2208000	I'm like, all right.
2208000	2209000	Well, I'll keep coming to you.
2209000	2210000	She's like, you're not going to get better.
2210000	2213000	I'm like, okay.
2213000	2215000	She's never listened to the show.
2215000	2217000	Where was I?
2217000	2218000	Mirror.
2218000	2219000	Oh, she just said be a mirror.
2219000	2220000	And I was like, what?
2220000	2221000	And she's like, yeah.
2221000	2224000	You know, people want to, when they, when they come,
2224000	2226000	when someone puts out an emotional bid,
2226000	2228000	for instance, if you're in a couple, like, like,
2228000	2231000	is somebody saying, look at that thing over there,
2231000	2233000	or I did this thing today, or whatever.
2233000	2235000	They're not saying necessarily.
2235000	2237000	They don't have the time to say.
2237000	2241000	Or they're like, I, I have something to say.
2241000	2244000	And I've thought it through,
2244000	2246000	and it's the most important thing in the world.
2246000	2248000	And it's so worthy of your attention.
2248000	2250000	And it says so much about me.
2250000	2252000	And also, you know, it's just, it's a lot of times it's just,
2252000	2254000	we're just like little, you know, animals.
2254000	2257000	We're just like touching each other verbally, of course.
2257000	2260000	We're just like, it's, so I have this problem,
2260000	2262000	like small talk, like I can't, you know,
2262000	2264000	and it's like a lot of, I'm sure a lot of my audience
2264000	2266000	has small talk problems.
2266000	2268000	You know, whether you have ADD or Asperger's,
2268000	2270000	that's really the two groups in my audience.
2270000	2272000	But, but both have a problem with small talk,
2272000	2274000	because it's like, kind of like, I don't know,
2274000	2276000	it engages the logical part of your brain.
2276000	2277000	And you're like, well, what do you, what do you mean?
2278000	2279000	Why are you telling, like, I don't know
2279000	2280000	what you're telling me, man.
2280000	2282000	But, but it doesn't, it's not that simple either.
2282000	2283000	It's not like we're Spock and we want people
2283000	2284000	to just make sense.
2284000	2286000	It's like, it's just, also, it's like,
2286000	2288000	some people say shit just because they want to,
2288000	2289000	they want to talk.
2289000	2290000	I don't fucking know yet.
2290000	2293000	But, but like, I always thought, it was like,
2293000	2294000	we all have energy.
2294000	2296000	Like, I have a bucket of energy when I wake up.
2296000	2297000	You have a bucket of energy.
2297000	2298000	Some people have a hole in the bottom
2298000	2299000	of their bucket of energy.
2299000	2302000	They're called executives.
2302000	2303000	No, I don't.
2303000	2304000	I had to riff a thing.
2304000	2305000	I don't know.
2306000	2307000	But, but like, some people, you know,
2307000	2308000	you've met those people.
2308000	2309000	They're just like, hey, what about me?
2309000	2310000	And you're like, oh, you.
2310000	2311000	And you pour some in.
2311000	2312000	And because the hole's not that big,
2312000	2313000	it kind of fills up a little bit.
2313000	2315000	And then you're like, wait, it's Wednesday.
2315000	2317000	Didn't you say, hey, what about me on Tuesday?
2317000	2318000	But, and you slowly learn over time
2318000	2319000	that they're a vampire.
2319000	2321000	Like, they're going to suck all of your juice
2321000	2322000	into their bucket.
2322000	2323000	And theirs has no bottom.
2323000	2324000	Yours does.
2324000	2325000	But yours doesn't fill that fast
2325000	2326000	because you have dignity.
2326000	2329000	But, but it's not necessarily like that.
2329000	2331000	You have, you could just, people can just
2331000	2332000	radiate things.
2332000	2334000	Like, I radiate shame.
2334000	2337000	I have so much shame that if everyone lets me,
2337000	2339000	the fucking buckets would overflow with it.
2339000	2342000	Like, no one wants to deal with my shame.
2342000	2343000	I love it.
2343000	2345000	I'm just, it certainly fills a show out
2345000	2347000	after we run out of shit.
2347000	2349000	I mean, United Leggings Forever 12, that's it.
2349000	2351000	I don't know why I keep looking at this.
2351000	2354000	But, but like, I think, you know,
2354000	2356000	there are people who are good at that thing
2356000	2358000	that we tease therapists for when they listen
2358000	2361000	and then they repeat what you said back to you.
2361000	2363000	They go like, what I'm hearing is this and that.
2363000	2366000	But like, you can do that emotionally.
2366000	2371000	You don't even have to really actually say the words.
2371000	2374000	It's just that you could perceive yourself as a mirror.
2374000	2376000	And it's about them.
2376000	2378000	It's not about you.
2378000	2380000	It's like your job in the conversation
2380000	2384000	is for them to have some time to work some shit out.
2384000	2387000	And that can actually be good for them.
2387000	2389000	And you're a mirror.
2389000	2391000	So you're, you're a passive role,
2391000	2394000	but you're like actively like helping them.
2394000	2395000	It's called listening.
2395000	2397000	Or a first date.
2397000	2398000	It's called a first date.
2398000	2400000	Because on your first date, you're like, what?
2400000	2402000	Yes, more.
2402000	2403000	You're chill.
2403000	2404000	What?
2404000	2407000	Your dad, he was underwater.
2407000	2410000	Oh, man.
2410000	2413000	But, but as we get familiar with people, we're like,
2413000	2414000	God damn, underwater.
2414000	2415000	I heard the first time.
2415000	2416000	Jesus Christ.
2416000	2419000	But truthfully, you'd always be super satisfied
2419000	2422000	if you stayed interested in the shit that was around you.
2422000	2423000	Yeah, because nobody, yeah.
2423000	2424000	I mean, if you stayed in the moment.
2424000	2427000	Being a mirror is not just like, like listening.
2427000	2429000	It's like saying like, like not, like you can just
2429000	2431000	reflect what they're saying back at them
2431000	2433000	because that's why they're talking, right?
2433000	2435000	Yeah, I think it's, I think it's like, yeah.
2435000	2438000	It's like, you don't have to just mockingly repeat back
2438000	2442000	or make a photocopy or, but like, it's just listening, I guess.
2442000	2444000	I had to think of it as a mirror because otherwise,
2444000	2446000	I was thinking of it as like an exchange.
2446000	2448000	Like, oh, I'm giving you energy.
2448000	2449000	When do I get it back?
2449000	2450000	I'm giving you time.
2450000	2452000	When do I, oh, that just came from Minecraft.
2452000	2454000	Now I can play Minecraft less time.
2454000	2455000	No, I'm a mirror.
2455000	2458000	No, I'm getting fucked out of Minecraft time.
2458000	2459000	All right, well.
2459000	2462000	But, but if you're a mirror, okay, it doesn't apply to time.
2462000	2463000	You're still fucking me out of time.
2463000	2465000	I could be playing Minecraft, but.
2465000	2468000	I mean, do you feel fucked out of Minecraft time right now
2468000	2470000	because we're doing a harming time?
2470000	2473000	I mean, there's some things I'd like to try at my base.
2473000	2474000	No, I don't.
2474000	2475000	I'm fine here.
2475000	2476000	It's fine, you know.
2477000	2478000	What do we got?
2478000	2479000	Another hour to come back?
2479000	2480000	Shady ass answer.
2480000	2481000	It's fine.
2481000	2482000	No, no, it's fine.
2482000	2483000	It's fine.
2483000	2484000	I think.
2484000	2485000	That was your one-one show.
2485000	2486000	The answer was yes.
2486000	2487000	It's fine.
2487000	2488000	The answer was yes.
2488000	2489000	What do you mean?
2489000	2490000	No, no.
2490000	2491000	I'm not gonna, I know I'm not gonna be all the way happy
2491000	2494000	when I'm playing Minecraft tonight as soon as I get home.
2494000	2496000	I'm not gonna immediately become blissful.
2496000	2498000	I'm like, I'm, if I didn't have this,
2498000	2500000	I'd be unhappy over time.
2500000	2503000	Do you, do you play Minecraft with Jeremy Arnz?
2504000	2507000	And what is that like?
2507000	2508000	Yeah.
2508000	2512000	And do your Jeremy Arnz impression while you tell us the story.
2515000	2517000	What will you do with that wood?
2520000	2521000	Who are you?
2525000	2526000	Patrick Stewart.
2528000	2530000	Can you send Jeremy Arnz in?
2530000	2531000	Yes.
2531000	2533000	So basically you want a second chance.
2533000	2534000	Yes.
2534000	2535000	Thank you, Patrick.
2536000	2537000	Jeremy.
2538000	2539000	Yes.
2541000	2542000	I'm Patrick Stewart.
2543000	2544000	I know.
2546000	2547000	That's pretty good.
2548000	2549000	Go talk to Dan.
2550000	2551000	I will.
2552000	2553000	Hello, Dan.
2555000	2556000	What did you eat?
2556000	2557000	A cupcake.
2558000	2559000	It's in your throat?
2559000	2560000	Yes.
2561000	2562000	Where's John Lithgow?
2562000	2563000	I'm right here.
2564000	2566000	My mouth is a circle.
2567000	2569000	I do a perfect John Lithgow
2569000	2572000	because I know how to make my mouth into a circle.
2574000	2575000	Hello?
2576000	2577000	Hello?
2577000	2578000	Hey Dan, this is Steve Levy.
2578000	2580000	This is John Lithgow.
2580000	2581000	Oh, sorry.
2581000	2582000	Do you have Dan's phone?
2582000	2584000	Can you give the phone to Dan for a second?
2584000	2586000	Dan, someone's calling you on the phone.
2587000	2588000	Hey Dan, I've got...
2588000	2589000	Hello?
2589000	2590000	I've got iced tea on the line for you.
2593000	2594000	All right.
2594000	2595000	Hello?
2604000	2605000	Yeah.
2608000	2609000	Who is this?
2610000	2611000	This is iced tea.
2612000	2614000	Mr. T, don't ever.
2614000	2615000	Ever.
2616000	2617000	I mean, okay.
2618000	2619000	I didn't want to be informal.
2620000	2621000	Much more...
2621000	2624000	Less formal than calling me motherfucking iced Mr. T.
2624000	2625000	All right.
2625000	2628000	Well, what are you doing?
2628000	2632000	I called you to listen to you play Minecraft, motherfucker.
2633000	2634000	All right.
2634000	2635000	Describe it to me.
2638000	2639000	What's it like?
2640000	2642000	When I'm digging into the dirt,
2642000	2645000	yeah, is every piece of dirt a cube?
2646000	2648000	So you do know a little bit about Minecraft,
2648000	2649000	it sounds like.
2649000	2651000	I didn't say that.
2651000	2652000	Shit.
2653000	2656000	All I could tell you, if I play Minecraft,
2656000	2658000	it's none of your business.
2659000	2660000	It's personal.
2663000	2664000	Well, I got to keep playing.
2664000	2666000	I have to put one hand on...
2666000	2668000	Yeah, on the WASD keys.
2669000	2671000	And if you're playing on a Mac OS,
2671000	2672000	you got to use the trackpad.
2672000	2675000	So you need two hands to put me on with Lithgow.
2675000	2677000	It's me, John Lithgow.
2678000	2680000	Talking to you, iced tea.
2681000	2683000	Yeah, John, what are we doing later?
2683000	2685000	I would like to go fishing.
2686000	2688000	For lamprey.
2688000	2691000	So I can experience visualizing a creature
2691000	2693000	with his more circular mouth than me.
2695000	2697000	Damn, that's fucked up.
2702000	2704000	I'm coming to pick you up now.
2705000	2706000	Okay, cool.
2707000	2708000	Go away.
2709000	2710000	Damn.
2710000	2711000	Hello?
2712000	2714000	Dan, this is your other cell phone.
2714000	2715000	This is iced tea.
2716000	2717000	Oh, sorry.
2717000	2718000	Mr. T, Walter...
2718000	2720000	No, don't fucking do it.
2720000	2722000	You think it's respectful, but it's not.
2722000	2724000	Mr. T, this is important.
2726000	2727000	Walter Mathow's on the line.
2727000	2728000	He really...
2729000	2731000	He needs to talk to you.
2731000	2733000	It's a matter of real importance.
2733000	2734000	All right, put him on.
2734000	2736000	Wait, is it personal?
2736000	2738000	No, actually, this is business.
2738000	2739000	Oh, cool.
2740000	2741000	Business I can do.
2741000	2743000	I got John Lithgow coming to pick me up.
2743000	2745000	I can do business.
2747000	2748000	Yo, Walter.
2748000	2751000	Mathow, what's going on?
2752000	2753000	What is...
2762000	2764000	The fuck is going on over there, man?
2764000	2765000	You eating a Muppet?
2765000	2766000	What?
2766000	2768000	Oh, shit, there's an Amber Alert.
2770000	2772000	My fucking phone's just blowing up.
2772000	2774000	There's an Amber Alert?
2775000	2779000	Yo, man, you Walter Mathow, Richard Nixon, and this shit.
2781000	2783000	Yeah, flush that impression.
2784000	2786000	Amber Alert.
2786000	2789000	Be on the lookout for a Ford, Taurus,
2790000	2793000	97, six-cylinder,
2794000	2795000	Blaupunk.
2795000	2797000	Damn, this a fucking good ride.
2800000	2801000	What am I...
2801000	2802000	Wait.
2807000	2809000	What are you doing?
2809000	2810000	What are you doing?
2810000	2811000	What are you...
2811000	2812000	No, wait, don't wait.
2812000	2813000	Oh, well, okay.
2813000	2814000	I tried to.
2814000	2815000	All right.
2815000	2816000	All right.
2816000	2817000	Yo.
2817000	2818000	Yo.
2819000	2820000	Okay.
2820000	2821000	Yo.
2822000	2823000	Yo.
2824000	2826000	My name is Baby Ice Tea.
2826000	2828000	I'm as small as tea can be.
2829000	2833000	I'm just a small cup of tea, but I'm already as icy as I can be.
2833000	2836000	When you add the ice to the C and the E,
2836000	2839000	you get it as small as it can be.
2839000	2841000	I'm not doing rhymes that are hard.
2841000	2844000	I'm just rhyming ice tea.
2845000	2847000	But look at me, shrinking down.
2847000	2848000	I'm a tiny ice tea,
2848000	2850000	smaller than an ice cube that you could freeze.
2850000	2854000	I'm going to go out to the streets and try to enemies.
2854000	2856000	Try to enemies?
2857000	2859000	I'm your enemy.
2860000	2862000	Who are you?
2862000	2864000	Giant ice tea.
2867000	2872000	This universe lacks an imagination.
2872000	2874000	What it makes up for?
2874000	2875000	It conflict.
2876000	2879000	Fundamental conflict.
2880000	2881000	Yo.
2881000	2886000	I don't see how that conflict could be of any merit
2886000	2889000	when I'm tiny ice tea and you're giant.
2889000	2893000	Then you don't watch enough Marvel movies.
2893000	2894000	Yo.
2894000	2896000	My name is tiny ice tea.
2896000	2897000	My name is giant ice tea.
2897000	2898000	We're in the place to be.
2898000	2901000	I tried to fuck your mama with some harmony,
2901000	2906000	but I couldn't do it when my voice switches between the two of us.
2906000	2909000	I fucked your mama so hard, my dick's a bus.
2909000	2914000	And my dick's a flea, because I'm little tiny ice tea.
2914000	2916000	Yo, your dick's a flea.
2916000	2919000	Why are you going to use your rap to talk about me?
2919000	2926000	Because I'm big as a tree, and I don't get away with as much as you do.
2927000	2928000	Because I'm an underdog.
2928000	2929000	Yeah.
2929000	2931000	That's my power.
2931000	2934000	Alright, yeah, you don't have to rub it in.
2934000	2938000	Don't play the underdog with me just because I'm the underdog
2938000	2941000	and it gives me more curating than thee.
2941000	2944000	You medieval fucking nerd.
2945000	2949000	My name is tiny ice tea, and you sound a lot like a fucking bully.
2949000	2952000	Oh, okay, alright, I'm a bully.
2952000	2954000	You win.
2954000	2958000	Yeah, well, fucking truth to power.
2958000	2964000	Motherfucker, my heart is going to stop 20 years earlier than yours.
2964000	2968000	It labors to get blood up to my brain.
2968000	2972000	I'm a giant ice tea, I'm going to fucking die.
2972000	2975000	You can't go to the bathroom in a normal place.
2975000	2976000	You can go anywhere.
2976000	2978000	You're functionally invisible.
2978000	2981000	Socially, everyone's on your side.
2981000	2984000	I'm giant ice tea.
2984000	2989000	You know, I'm giant ice tea, and right about now I'm going to check my IV,
2989000	2992000	my insulin levels are chopping down.
2992000	2994000	I've got to get it.
2994000	2996000	Why is everyone...
2996000	2999000	I don't know why everybody groaned.
2999000	3003000	Was there a thing in the paper about the real ice tea and the diabetes?
3003000	3007000	We smell bad for you, giant ice tea, we smell bad.
3007000	3009000	What's your name?
3009000	3013000	I'm Jack and the Beanstalk real estate agent.
3013000	3017000	Yeah, I sell beanstalks.
3017000	3023000	Do you have anything available for a lonely giant that wants to die in peace?
3024000	3029000	We call these one way up, no way down beanstalks.
3029000	3031000	So he's saying if he...
3031000	3033000	No, it's giant ice tea.
3033000	3035000	He's not shopping with me.
3035000	3037000	Yeah, I don't want to...
3037000	3039000	I'm not sure I want to hang out with giant ice tea.
3039000	3041000	Oh, I love you.
3041000	3044000	He's still paying back rent on that mouse hole I sold him.
3044000	3046000	Oh, shit.
3046000	3047000	Yeah.
3047000	3049000	They know the fuck I am giant ice tea.
3049000	3051000	That's a home office.
3051000	3053000	That tiny mice hole is business.
3053000	3055000	Oh, okay.
3055000	3058000	You can't seem to make tiny mice hole rent money.
3058000	3060000	The fucking bubble burst, motherfucker.
3060000	3062000	Yeah, all right, all right.
3062000	3066000	Goddamn, now that fucking Obama's America's got to be on my shoulders.
3066000	3070000	You always trying to be political when all I want is my money, you little motherfucker.
3070000	3073000	Oh, don't side with the split.
3073000	3074000	I won't.
3074000	3077000	That's a new term I made up.
3077000	3079000	We're all...
3079000	3081000	Well, fuck him, that little guy.
3081000	3083000	Let's get into some of these bean stalks.
3083000	3084000	Okay, talk to me.
3084000	3090000	I got $700 in giant money.
3090000	3092000	All right, all right.
3092000	3094000	Let me see if I can speak to one of my other agents.
3094000	3095000	Oh, shit.
3095000	3096000	Johnny Vavado.
3096000	3097000	Oh, shit.
3097000	3098000	Johnny Vavado.
3098000	3099000	Yes.
3099000	3101000	This guy busting my balls all day long.
3101000	3102000	You want to buy a beautiful.
3102000	3105000	Oh, hell no.
3105000	3108000	He says he's got 700 giant money.
3108000	3112000	Yo, yeah.
3112000	3114000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3114000	3115000	Uh-oh, uh-oh.
3115000	3116000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3116000	3117000	Tell these people who?
3117000	3119000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3119000	3120000	Tell these people who?
3120000	3124000	Um, sold.
3124000	3126000	Because that is what we do?
3126000	3130000	Those Snoop Tamios are getting lazier and lazier.
3130000	3135000	Did he even rhyme?
3135000	3139000	In his defense, he smokes a lot of weed.
3139000	3140000	Jesus.
3140000	3143000	No, I mean, it's a buyer's market right now, so.
3143000	3146000	I mean, like, what am I going to hold out for 800?
3146000	3148000	I'll do $700 sold.
3148000	3149000	Sold?
3149000	3150000	Yeah.
3150000	3151000	All right.
3151000	3152000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3152000	3153000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3153000	3154000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3154000	3155000	I'm a giant iced tea.
3155000	3158000	And right about now, I'm going to move in for me.
3158000	3160000	I'm going to get a place on top of the clouds.
3160000	3163000	I'm going to play my music, quiet and loud.
3163000	3165000	And then I'm going to make a giant cake.
3165000	3166000	And I'm going to eat it.
3166000	3168000	Because it's what it takes to make me happy.
3168000	3170000	I've got an eating disorder.
3170000	3171000	It's called bulimia.
3171000	3174000	Look it up.
3174000	3176000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3176000	3179000	Yo, do you want a few avocados?
3179000	3182000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3182000	3183000	I have a few avocados.
3183000	3185000	I'd like every one you have.
3185000	3187000	I'd like to put them all in a bag.
3187000	3189000	I only have, like, four avocados.
3189000	3191000	As long as I can eat them when no one's watching.
3191000	3192000	All right.
3193000	3196000	Okay, thank you.
3196000	3198000	Enjoy my avocados.
3198000	3200000	Thank you, Johnny Vavados.
3203000	3206000	I'll take this tea and climb up the vine.
3206000	3208000	Looks like the house is already here.
3208000	3209000	That's fine.
3209000	3211000	Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
3211000	3213000	Are you thirsty?
3213000	3214000	Yes.
3214000	3216000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3216000	3217000	Are you thirsty?
3217000	3220000	Are you wanting to wash those avocados down with?
3220000	3221000	Yes.
3221000	3223000	I have two clematos.
3226000	3229000	Did you follow me here?
3229000	3232000	I was told those were one-way vines.
3232000	3233000	I just...
3233000	3236000	I want the customer to be satisfied.
3236000	3239000	But now you have to live here your entire life?
3239000	3242000	Well, my name is Johnny Vavados.
3242000	3244000	Well, now we're rooming...
3244000	3245000	Yes.
3245000	3247000	...capados.
3249000	3250000	I'll be right back.
3250000	3251000	Where are you?
3251000	3253000	That's my house.
3253000	3254000	I'm following you.
3254000	3256000	I'm going into my house.
3256000	3257000	Okay, my name is Johnny Vavados.
3257000	3259000	Are you going to follow me down the street?
3259000	3261000	I'm going into my house.
3261000	3263000	We're on top of a vine.
3263000	3266000	My name is Giant Ice Tea, and I'm here to say,
3266000	3269000	here's what's happened up until this minute.
3269000	3271000	I bought a vine.
3271000	3272000	I climbed it.
3272000	3274000	My house is at the top of it.
3274000	3275000	I'm going into my house.
3275000	3277000	As I was nearing the front door,
3277000	3279000	you called from behind me.
3280000	3281000	That you had comatas.
3281000	3282000	Wow.
3282000	3284000	I'm holding a bag with four avocados.
3284000	3285000	That sounds like a great...
3285000	3286000	Hey, hi.
3286000	3287000	Oh, God.
3287000	3288000	Who are you?
3288000	3290000	I'm a golden goose, man.
3290000	3291000	I'm just...
3291000	3292000	I'm hanging out here, too.
3292000	3293000	Shit.
3293000	3294000	Yeah.
3294000	3295000	That sounds like a great story.
3295000	3297000	Then what happened?
3298000	3299000	What happened then?
3299000	3301000	I'd like to...
3301000	3302000	I want to go to the market.
3302000	3303000	I'll be right back.
3303000	3305000	Hey, I'm going to come with you.
3305000	3307000	I need to get some shit.
3307000	3308000	There's a market up here?
3309000	3310000	Yeah, yeah.
3310000	3311000	I was told...
3311000	3312000	Oh, shit.
3313000	3314000	All right.
3314000	3315000	I live upstairs.
3315000	3317000	I'm so quiet.
3318000	3319000	I'm so quiet.
3319000	3321000	You won't even know I'm there.
3321000	3323000	You probably don't even recognize me.
3323000	3326000	You live upstairs in my house?
3326000	3327000	In my house?
3327000	3328000	Yeah, in your bedroom.
3328000	3329000	In your house?
3329000	3330000	You live in my bedroom?
3330000	3331000	Yeah.
3331000	3333000	Are you mirroring me?
3333000	3339000	Did you just mirror me?
3339000	3340000	My name is Johnny Vavatos.
3340000	3341000	I give you avocados.
3341000	3342000	Johnny, wait.
3342000	3343000	Wait, don't go.
3343000	3344000	I give you avocados.
3344000	3345000	Also, you want some shoes?
3345000	3346000	Yes.
3346000	3347000	Sure.
3347000	3348000	They're called zapatos.
3350000	3351000	I'll be right back.
3351000	3353000	I'll be right back when I come up with more rhymes for my own name.
3353000	3354000	Wait, wait.
3354000	3355000	I got to get my phone.
3355000	3356000	I'm coming with you.
3356000	3357000	Okay.
3357000	3358000	I just got to find my phone.
3358000	3359000	God damn it.
3359000	3360000	All right.
3360000	3361000	It's right here.
3361000	3362000	What?
3362000	3363000	To the front door of my house.
3363000	3366000	I left the door open.
3366000	3367000	Hi.
3367000	3368000	Surprise.
3368000	3369000	What?
3369000	3370000	What?
3370000	3371000	How you doing?
3371000	3372000	Happy birthday.
3372000	3373000	It's us.
3373000	3375000	You thought we were outside.
3375000	3377000	We're inside.
3377000	3381000	Welcome to your own place.
3381000	3387000	We thought we were going to the migrant.
3388000	3390000	We're actually inside.
3390000	3396000	I got ripped off and bought a house, and it's not even my house.
3396000	3398000	It's your house.
3398000	3399000	We were just leaving.
3399000	3400000	We were just leaving.
3400000	3401000	Yeah, we're going to leave.
3401000	3402000	We're going to the market.
3402000	3406000	If you look in the fridge, there's like four avocados, a couple of comatas.
3406000	3409000	My name is Johnny Vavados.
3409000	3412000	But the baby-dyed coats are mine.
3412000	3414000	Don't touch those.
3414000	3417000	Where's my fucking phone?
3417000	3421000	Also, your dog walker left a DVD in the DVD player.
3421000	3424000	I'm going to check that out.
3424000	3425000	It's about black people.
3425000	3427000	You'll be probably enjoying it.
3427000	3429000	I'm going to call the locksmith.
3429000	3432000	No, I'm going to call that fucking realtor.
3432000	3442000	Beep, boop, fee, five, foo, foo, five, five, five, fo, five.
3442000	3444000	Tea stops.
3444000	3448000	Yeah, are you the guy that sold me the house on top of the vine?
3448000	3449000	I'm giant iced tea.
3449000	3450000	Oh, giant iced tea.
3450000	3451000	How's it going, man?
3451000	3452000	Do you love the view?
3452000	3453000	Not good.
3453000	3454000	What's going on?
3454000	3456000	I heard you celebrated a birthday.
3456000	3458000	Yeah, not my birthday.
3458000	3462000	Didn't find people living in my house.
3462000	3464000	Oh, you met the goose.
3464000	3467000	That motherfucker can roll, man.
3467000	3471000	Your boss, I think, lives with me too.
3471000	3474000	Oh, I forgot to mention that.
3474000	3477000	Listen, have a great time.
3477000	3481000	I want to let you know that beanstalk is something that really means a lot to me,
3481000	3482000	so I hope you enjoy it.
3482000	3483000	It's a ripoff.
3483000	3484000	You just took my money.
3484000	3487000	I should come down that vine and crush you.
3487000	3489000	Hey, man, it's Trump's America.
3489000	3491000	We all just trying to survive, all right?
3491000	3493000	Now, I used to sell mobile homes before this,
3493000	3496000	and I thought you'd be happy with that beanstalk.
3496000	3497000	It's nice.
3497000	3498000	It's uphill.
3498000	3499000	Not a lot of people up there.
3499000	3502000	And that goose lays golden eggs, and they're delicious.
3502000	3507000	I guess my only goal was to come up here and die.
3507000	3510000	You might want to learn about other people, baby.
3510000	3511000	Talk to the people around you.
3511000	3512000	Learn something.
3512000	3515000	I didn't want it to be a fish out of water story where it was thrust upon me,
3515000	3520000	like northern exposure or any sitcom.
3520000	3525000	We all want to be left alone until we're dying.
3525000	3527000	That's just how life works.
3527000	3530000	All right, I'm not through with you, but goodbye.
3530000	3532000	Hey, tell that goose I said hello.
3532000	3533000	Click.
3533000	3535000	Hey, I'm back.
3535000	3536000	Hey.
3536000	3537000	Yo.
3537000	3539000	Anybody leave any messages?
3539000	3542000	Fifi fo fum, I thought your mom was so hard,
3542000	3543000	my dick was a thumb.
3543000	3545000	I'm a giant iced tea.
3545000	3547000	Can't hear her say I'm going to swing on the chandelier
3547000	3549000	and make you gay.
3549000	3554000	By kissing you, take you to the beach like moonlight tunes.
3554000	3559000	It's a sequel with me and you.
3559000	3562000	Sorry, I was just rapping.
3562000	3563000	Hello.
3563000	3565000	Did you just make me gay?
3565000	3567000	No, it's just a giant culture.
3567000	3569000	How do you make everything easier?
3569000	3574000	It's still okay for a giant to be.
3574000	3576000	Hello, hello.
3576000	3578000	Hello, giant iced tea?
3578000	3579000	Yes.
3579000	3581000	It's your mother.
3581000	3583000	Mom.
3583000	3586000	Um, hello.
3586000	3591000	Mom, is this personal?
3591000	3595000	I told you to hurry before I normalize, Gloria.
3595000	3597000	Are you talking to your damn son again?
3597000	3598000	Yes, honey, not now.
3598000	3599000	This is business.
3599000	3601000	I'm here to shut your head up.
3601000	3610000	I see Dad is still up to his old tricks.
3610000	3611000	We miss you.
3611000	3613000	We haven't heard from you in a while.
3613000	3616000	Yeah, well, it doesn't sound like he does.
3616000	3617000	Well, guess what?
3617000	3619000	Here's the newsletter, Mom.
3619000	3620000	I'm still giant.
3620000	3624000	No one wants to hire me as a graphic designer.
3624000	3631000	And it's really fucking expensive to live in Los Angeles.
3631000	3634000	Why don't you just, you can move back home.
3634000	3636000	We still have your room here if you want.
3636000	3637000	Great.
3637000	3638000	Oh, no.
3638000	3641000	Turn it into a weed room.
3641000	3642000	Oh, honey, honey.
3642000	3644000	Hey, the phone knows how to hurry.
3644000	3646000	Honey, honey, don't get personal.
3646000	3647000	This is business.
3647000	3650000	I'm talking to our son.
3650000	3652000	Look, son, I know he's not your real father,
3652000	3655000	but he's the only father you've ever known.
3655000	3658000	What?
3658000	3659000	What?
3659000	3660000	Oh, shit.
3660000	3661000	What the fuck?
3661000	3662000	You didn't know that?
3662000	3666000	No, why would I be upset about his approval if...
3666000	3667000	No.
3667000	3668000	I thought he was...
3668000	3669000	Oh, my God.
3669000	3670000	No wonder I'm a giant.
3670000	3671000	Yo.
3671000	3672000	Yo, yo, yo.
3672000	3673000	My name is Giant Ice Tea, and I've been a fool.
3673000	3678000	I didn't observe the size of my parents' tea in relationship to me.
3678000	3679000	Put it together.
3679000	3682000	I've been fucking mamas in all my raps, and now I've fallen into a mama-fuck trap.
3682000	3683000	So I fucked my mama, and it was just...
3683000	3684000	Oh, my God.
3684000	3685000	Oh, my God.
3685000	3686000	Oh, my God.
3686000	3687000	Oh, my God.
3687000	3688000	Oh, my God.
3688000	3689000	Oh, my God.
3689000	3690000	Oh, my God.
3690000	3691000	Oh, my God.
3691000	3692000	Oh, my God.
3723000	3726000	Giant Ice Tea?
3726000	3727000	Oh, that's just...
3727000	3729000	I just Googled me.
3730000	3732000	I'm Googling the word father.
3732000	3733000	Okay.
3733000	3734000	Oh.
3734000	3735000	Okay.
3735000	3736000	Why did it bother?
3736000	3737000	Um, can I...
3737000	3739000	Oh, I should order some more soy milk.
3740000	3744000	Honey, should I stay on the line, or should I hang up?
3745000	3746000	Sorry, what?
3746000	3748000	Should I stay on the line, or do you want your mother to hang up?
3748000	3750000	This sounds personal.
3750000	3751000	Johnny?
3751000	3752000	I don't know who you are.
3752000	3753000	I'm sorry, dude.
3753000	3754000	I'm your mother.
3754000	3755000	Oh.
3755000	3756000	Well, you're just talking like a guy now.
3756000	3757000	I hadn't hung up yet.
3757000	3758000	I just wanted to make sure.
3758000	3759000	Oh.
3759000	3760000	Where do you...
3760000	3762000	Where does my biological father live?
3762000	3764000	He's next to me right now.
3764000	3767000	You said that he wasn't my father.
3767000	3769000	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
3769000	3771000	Your biological father.
3775000	3779000	My name is Giant Ice Tea, and that was your waste.
3781000	3785000	All right, montage of me googling genealogical...
3786000	3787000	Hello?
3787000	3788000	Hello.
3788000	3789000	Hello.
3789000	3791000	This is Giant Ice Tea.
3791000	3792000	Yes.
3792000	3794000	This is your father.
3794000	3796000	Jeremy Irons.
3799000	3803000	The famous figure that calls it ironic times?
3803000	3804000	That's so stupid.
3804000	3805000	I'm so...
3805000	3806000	I'm sorry, dad.
3806000	3807000	Wait, we're...
3807000	3808000	I'm just kidding.
3809000	3810000	This is Johnny Vavatos.
3812000	3813000	Click.
3815000	3817000	He had a lot of bravado.
3818000	3819000	A lot of bravados.
3820000	3822000	All right, montage of him.
3822000	3825000	I found my genealogical information.
3826000	3831000	He lives at 11121, Washington.
3832000	3833000	Do you need a ride?
3833000	3834000	Jesus, yes.
3834000	3835000	What are you...
3835000	3836000	Okay, come on.
3836000	3837000	Let's go.
3837000	3839000	You got to do some shit over there anyway.
3839000	3840000	Do you fly?
3840000	3841000	Yeah, man.
3841000	3842000	Get on me.
3842000	3843000	I'm trying.
3844000	3845000	Yeah, well.
3845000	3846000	You're tiny.
3846000	3847000	You're like the size of...
3847000	3848000	Do you want a ride?
3848000	3849000	Yeah.
3849000	3850000	Get on me.
3850000	3851000	Okay.
3851000	3853000	You want to see my asshole?
3856000	3859000	Because gold comes out of it.
3860000	3861000	Yes, and?
3861000	3865000	Okay, you got to look real close for the gold.
3865000	3866000	Okay, all right.
3868000	3869000	You got to look real close.
3869000	3870000	It's just brown.
3870000	3871000	No, no, no.
3871000	3872000	No, no, no.
3872000	3873000	Wait.
3873000	3875000	That's first, and then the gold will come soon.
3876000	3877000	It's brown.
3877000	3878000	Do you see it?
3878000	3879000	Do you see the gold yet?
3879000	3880000	Yeah, it's gross.
3880000	3881000	It's just shit.
3881000	3882000	I don't...
3882000	3883000	No, no, no, no, no.
3883000	3885000	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
3885000	3886000	Here.
3886000	3887000	Wait, wait, wait.
3887000	3888000	No, no, no, no.
3888000	3889000	Here comes the gold.
3889000	3890000	I'm kidding.
3890000	3891000	No, it's so gross.
3891000	3892000	No, no, no, no, no.
3892000	3893000	Twenty-two minutes later.
3893000	3894000	It's everywhere.
3894000	3895000	It's everywhere.
3896000	3897000	I'm serious.
3897000	3898000	It just...
3898000	3899000	Hey, it's magic, you know.
3899000	3900000	It's gonna happen.
3900000	3901000	Just wait.
3901000	3904000	Actually, you know, I've never done this before.
3904000	3905000	I've never, ever...
3905000	3907000	You've never laid a golden egg?
3907000	3909000	No, no, but it could happen.
3909000	3910000	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
3910000	3911000	No.
3911000	3914000	If you have faith, if you have faith, if you believe...
3914000	3917000	I'm tired of it being my fault that everything goes wrong.
3917000	3919000	It's fucking the worst.
3919000	3921000	Like, everyone else is an asshole.
3921000	3924000	The world was stacked against me when I was born.
3925000	3926000	It fucking sucks.
3926000	3928000	Like, everyone else is just stupid.
3928000	3929000	It has no morality.
3929000	3931000	Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.
3932000	3933000	That was it.
3933000	3934000	Oh, my God.
3934000	3935000	There's a tiny golden egg here.
3935000	3936000	Golden egg.
3936000	3937000	Whoa.
3937000	3938000	It worked.
3938000	3939000	You believed in me.
3939000	3940000	That's all I wanted.
3940000	3941000	Wow.
3941000	3942000	Oh, thank you.
3942000	3944000	Let's get to my father's house.
3944000	3945000	Yeah.
3947000	3948000	I don't have anything.
3948000	3949000	You go without me.
3949000	3950000	I'm gonna watch some shit on TV.
3950000	3952000	You can't fly, can you?
3952000	3953000	No.
3954000	3957000	You know, I didn't think I could shit a golden egg either, to be honest,
3957000	3959000	and I just did, so...
3959000	3961000	Yeah, okay, I'll fly you there.
3961000	3962000	All right, get out.
3964000	3965000	Amber Alert.
3967000	3970000	Man presenting himself as a golden goose.
3970000	3971000	Not really a goose.
3973000	3975000	No, no, no, don't look at that.
3975000	3976000	Don't look at that.
3976000	3978000	He just paints his poop gold.
3978000	3979000	No, no, no, no.
3979000	3980000	He says bullshit.
3980000	3983000	If you are currently holding what you think is a golden egg,
3983000	3985000	you're probably holding golden poop.
3985000	3986000	No, no, no, no.
3986000	3987000	Ask the goose if he can fly.
3987000	3989000	No, no, no, don't ask him.
3990000	3991000	That's fake.
3991000	3992000	It's fake.
3992000	3993000	Come on, come on, come on.
3993000	3994000	Just go.
3994000	3996000	Yeah!
3997000	3999000	Smash!
4001000	4002000	He's dead.
4004000	4005000	My name is China Iced Tea.
4005000	4009000	Here to say I'm gonna call an Uber in the usual way.
4009000	4010000	Boop, beep, boop, boop.
4010000	4011000	V-5-4.
4011000	4014000	So, Uber shows up and away I go.
4015000	4017000	Driving across the clouds.
4017000	4019000	Guys playing Armenian music pretty loud.
4020000	4024000	I can smell his cologne, but I'm gonna see my father won't die alone.
4025000	4027000	But I'm here with you too.
4027000	4029000	Oh shit, Tiny Iced Tea.
4029000	4030000	Yo.
4031000	4033000	It's fucked up, man.
4033000	4036000	It's not personal, it's business.
4039000	4040000	Hello.
4042000	4043000	Giant Iced Tea?
4043000	4044000	Yes.
4044000	4045000	This is your mother again.
4046000	4049000	I feel like you should know something.
4050000	4054000	Your father, your biological father, is Tiny Iced Tea.
4061000	4064000	Listen man, there was never gonna be a good time to say it.
4067000	4070000	Stop the car, stop the Uber, stop it.
4072000	4073000	Are you sure?
4074000	4075000	I think I know better.
4075000	4077000	No you don't, just stop the car.
4079000	4082000	Okay, well you're not women, so I'll do what you want.
4084000	4086000	Yeah, if I eroded them.
4089000	4090000	Where are you going, son?
4090000	4092000	Please, these are clouds, you can walk forever.
4092000	4094000	Shut up, leave me alone.
4095000	4100000	I'm walking behind you as you're marching forward, the camera's in front of you and tracking.
4101000	4102000	It's one of those shots.
4103000	4104000	Stop describing it!
4105000	4107000	You act like that's something I do all the time.
4108000	4110000	No, just shut up, I hate you.
4113000	4114000	I can't say I love you.
4116000	4117000	I'm stopping.
4119000	4120000	Cause I don't know you.
4122000	4124000	But I want to get to know you.
4125000	4127000	If you wanna know me, here's what you gotta do.
4128000	4130000	I'm gonna fuck your mama with my left and right shoe.
4132000	4133000	That's a start.
4134000	4136000	I fucked her with a fart.
4137000	4138000	I fucked her with a long dart.
4139000	4140000	I fucked her.
4145000	4146000	Dance.
4151000	4153000	Oh, we're dancing.
4154000	4156000	We're dancing the same way.
4157000	4161000	The camera's zooming in on me to see the moves that I share with you.
4162000	4165000	And then I take the moves and I do them when the camera pulls back.
4166000	4168000	Cause we're very different sizes.
4171000	4172000	I'm giant ice tea.
4173000	4174000	I'm tiny ice tea.
4175000	4176000	I'm tiny ice tea.
4177000	4178000	I'm giant ice tea.
4179000	4181000	Two ice teas in the place to be.
4182000	4185000	In a cloud world, fucked your mama so hard she turned into a girl.
4186000	4187000	I'm tiny.
4204000	4211000	Fucking epic battle of tiny ice tea and giant ice tea.
4212000	4213000	It was lowercase and capital T.
4214000	4215000	Right?
4215000	4216000	So many T's.
4217000	4218000	So good.
4219000	4220000	I mean, it went to a dark place.
4221000	4222000	It went to a dark place.
4223000	4226000	Then you don't have the face of somebody that you felt was wrong.
4227000	4228000	Yeah, I didn't like it.
4229000	4230000	I thought it was kind of meandering.
4231000	4232000	There's a lot of confusing breakdowns.
4233000	4234000	It takes a little while to get to that darkness.
4235000	4237000	But once we got there, it was dark.
4238000	4239000	But what did we really learn?
4240000	4241000	You know what was good was that Ed 209 thing.
4242000	4243000	That's what people are remembering.
4243000	4244000	They're like, that was kind of like that.
4245000	4246000	But it wasn't as good, right?
4247000	4248000	No, it was great.
4249000	4250000	We'll find out tomorrow.
4254000	4256000	I just wanted to know what happened to him.
4257000	4259000	I mean, I guess they're united with his father.
4260000	4262000	And what else do you do?
4263000	4264000	Closure.
4267000	4268000	Wrong song.
4269000	4272000	I mean, you have to look like it's not completed.
4273000	4275000	Yeah, I feel like, what's the point?
4276000	4277000	So you're back with your father. Who cares?
4278000	4279000	I think you found out who your father is.
4280000	4281000	You're at the bottom of the circle right now.
4282000	4283000	Now you've got to find out.
4284000	4285000	Yeah, but I wouldn't want to continue.
4286000	4287000	I just felt like a clunky property.
4288000	4289000	Clearly they move in together.
4290000	4291000	Yeah, but on a cloud.
4292000	4293000	And it's just clunky.
4294000	4295000	It's like the goose lives there.
4296000	4297000	You killed the goose.
4298000	4299000	I just wanted to move on.
4300000	4301000	I was panicking.
4302000	4303000	I was, like, narratively panicking.
4304000	4306000	I feel like you didn't make enough use out of those gifts you were given,
4307000	4308000	those avocados and clamados.
4309000	4311000	I feel like that's an opportunity.
4312000	4313000	That's like in a video game.
4314000	4316000	You go, oh, shit, I combined the avocados and the clamados.
4317000	4318000	That's what I wish, yeah.
4319000	4320000	Yeah, exactly.
4321000	4322000	Like, just to get the taste out of my mouth,
4323000	4326000	just do a standard five-minute, just do a little story.
4327000	4328000	Okay?
4329000	4330000	But it doesn't have to have music.
4331000	4332000	It's not a rap.
4333000	4334000	Just, like, tell a story from beginning to end.
4335000	4336000	Starting from where we left off?
4337000	4338000	No, no, totally different thing.
4339000	4340000	Just to clear my palate.
4341000	4342000	Because it was just like, all right.
4343000	4344000	I think you were afraid of what you were getting.
4345000	4348000	I think you're worried that you were getting somewhere too emotionally raw.
4351000	4353000	Are you saying he's having, like, a giant flashback?
4354000	4356000	You're saying you want to pick up now, you want to do,
4357000	4360000	like, it's years later and giant iced tea and tiny iced tea are living together.
4361000	4362000	You pick, I'll leave it to you.
4363000	4364000	All right, well, let's do that because then, okay.
4365000	4366000	So, we'll just wrap it up.
4367000	4368000	So, this is like the after the credits.
4372000	4373000	You want a beat?
4374000	4375000	No, no.
4376000	4377000	No.
4378000	4379000	This is after the credits.
4380000	4385000	In the news today, there's a thing with a flap on it.
4386000	4387000	It's going around.
4388000	4389000	It's going around.
4390000	4391000	This is just a downbeat.
4392000	4393000	There's nothing.
4394000	4395000	The news is just happening because otherwise,
4396000	4397000	there'd be a scene with someone staring into space.
4398000	4399000	That would be weird.
4400000	4401000	It's not foreshadowing.
4402000	4403000	I'm not talking about something important.
4404000	4405000	I'm not saying there's a meteor with strange contents.
4406000	4407000	I'm just saying there was a thing flapping around.
4407000	4409000	The Dow Jones there, that's innocuous.
4410000	4411000	In the news today, it's all right.
4412000	4413000	Doing it again.
4414000	4415000	In the news today, the Dow Jones was...
4416000	4417000	Okay, you won't mistake that for pipe.
4418000	4419000	Okay.
4420000	4421000	I love the Dow Jones.
4423000	4424000	Son, can I talk to you?
4425000	4426000	Shit.
4427000	4428000	Personal business.
4430000	4431000	I have cancer.
4434000	4435000	So do I.
4436000	4437000	What if we combine them?
4439000	4441000	What kind do you have?
4442000	4444000	Why does that matter?
4445000	4448000	Because I'm not going to combine random cancers.
4449000	4451000	Fuck, are you a doctor, motherfucker?
4452000	4453000	I don't have to be a doctor.
4454000	4455000	And I want to mix fucking...
4456000	4457000	Just random...
4458000	4459000	Motherfucker, we're doing...
4460000	4461000	Fuck you.
4462000	4463000	I didn't even have cancer.
4463000	4464000	Me neither, bitch!
4467000	4469000	I have, for real, I have cancer.
4471000	4472000	Me too.
4473000	4474000	What kind?
4475000	4476000	Testicular.
4477000	4478000	Prostate.
4479000	4480000	I don't really have cancer.
4481000	4482000	Fuck, fuck!
4483000	4485000	Now you're going to lose your testicles.
4486000	4490000	You piece of shit, after everything I've done,
4491000	4493000	brought you into this world.
4494000	4495000	Yeah.
4496000	4497000	So?
4498000	4499000	So what?
4500000	4502000	You don't give a fuck if I live or die, do you?
4503000	4504000	Maybe it's not that.
4505000	4506000	Maybe it's that I don't know what to do with my emotions,
4507000	4508000	because you didn't raise me right,
4509000	4510000	so you don't tell me.
4511000	4512000	You can't even talk.
4515000	4518000	Will you give me a ride to the hospital, motherfucker,
4519000	4522000	to get my fucking cancer-e testicle cut off?
4523000	4524000	Motherfucker, can you do me that?
4525000	4526000	All right, all right.
4527000	4530000	Jesus fucking Christ, like I asked for the fucking world.
4533000	4535000	I want to get one nut cut off, motherfucker.
4537000	4538000	All right.
4539000	4540000	My car's dirty.
4541000	4543000	You don't think I know where I am?
4545000	4547000	I'm a McDonald bag, motherfucker.
4549000	4551000	All right, get in.
4556000	4557000	Why are you saying fruit bread?
4558000	4559000	We both are.
4562000	4563000	Welcome to the hospital.
4569000	4570000	I know you.
4571000	4572000	I drive an Uber during the day.
4573000	4574000	Welcome to the hospital.
4575000	4576000	I make a five stars.
4579000	4581000	My father has testicular cancer.
4582000	4583000	He needs one of his testicles removed.
4584000	4588000	Well, I'm afraid there's no more health care.
4593000	4595000	What do you mean?
4596000	4598000	We both voted for Trump.
4602000	4605000	I'm glad to be on the same page as my son.
4605000	4608000	We are both hardcore laborers.
4609000	4614000	We backed the president that would give us less black health care.
4618000	4620000	Well, you made a mistake.
4621000	4622000	Let me guess.
4623000	4625000	You didn't like it because it said Obama in front of it.
4626000	4628000	Yeah, you don't have to pigeonhole us.
4630000	4631000	Psych.
4632000	4633000	That was your health care.
4634000	4638000	It was called Obama care by racists that wanted you to associate it with the black president.
4639000	4640000	Oh, fuck.
4641000	4644000	Now you have to keep your cancer testicle.
4649000	4651000	Hold on a second. I'm going to the news.
4652000	4655000	Oh, no, you get Obama's health care stolen.
4656000	4657000	You can lose your testicle.
4658000	4659000	Yay.
4660000	4667000	I love Obama now that I found out that racism doesn't really get you anywhere.
4669000	4670000	Politically speaking, it doesn't.
4671000	4677000	No, because people who gravitate towards politics are typically conniving average intelligent people.
4678000	4680000	They have 100 IQs. They're not geniuses.
4681000	4683000	They work on Wall Street or be physicists.
4684000	4689000	I guess our country was an experiment that lasted as long as it could before collapsing.
4691000	4697000	I wouldn't go that far. Jesus Christ, this is a whole emergency room full of young people out there that would like to hear something different.
4698000	4700000	You're not listening to me. You're not removed.
4702000	4706000	Dad, I don't give a fuck what they say.
4709000	4710000	Fuckin' love you.
4711000	4714000	Just hold on. One more snip.
4717000	4720000	Now this last one is very crucial.
4721000	4728000	You have a 70% chance of survival if you, if when I sniff it, snip it.
4731000	4734000	You have a bond with your son.
4735000	4742000	It's a freak thing about testosterone and the paternal biological axis.
4743000	4746000	Apparently, the incidence of testi...
4747000	4749000	Sorry, hold on a second.
4750000	4752000	Maggie, give me that thing.
4753000	4755000	Here it is, Doctor, shit.
4756000	4758000	Testicular cancer.
4758000	4765000	They started to rise as the government co-opted the father-son bond and infantilized the entire American family.
4766000	4773000	It made everyone go to work and raised everyone like they were children, eating Twinkies and watching TV and thinking that fame would end all their problems when actually we're just in an Orwellian future.
4774000	4779000	But because we're not wearing coveralls, it doesn't appear Orwellian. We're just wearing fucking t-shirts from shows we like.
4779000	4792000	But that has resulted in a lower sperm count across the American index, and it's also everyone's testicles are rotting away because fathers and sons don't get along with each other anymore.
4793000	4804000	So the point is, what I researched, if you just hold your son's hand and truly love him, you may survive this testicullectomy.
4805000	4807000	Well, it's worth a shot.
4808000	4809000	All right.
4810000	4811000	Handhold sound effect.
4813000	4814000	Smooch.
4819000	4822000	Carry on my way, wordsong.
4823000	4825000	Love you, peace behind you.
4826000	4827000	Son, I got you a kite.
4828000	4829000	Thank you.
4830000	4833000	Get y'all in the dame of the unknown, oh yeah.
4834000	4836000	Son, I got you a bicycle. Thank you.
4838000	4841000	Don't you cry no more. Snip.
4846000	4850000	Dad? Dad, no. I love the bike.
4851000	4858000	Daaaaaaaaaa!
4859000	4867000	Once I caught into a land of the future I went into a cornfield in a suture
4868000	4873000	And if I say that I'm a blind man It surely means that I can't see
4874000	4881000	I put my hat into a sock and a donut I got into a car and I couldn't start up
4882000	4885000	I try to drive home from the hospital
4886000	4888000	Cause my dad just died
4889000	4892000	Carry on my way, wordsong.
4893000	4896000	Love you, peace behind you, wordsong.
4900000	4901000	God damn.
4905000	4907000	I just saw you crying, giant.
4908000	4909000	And I couldn't believe it.
4910000	4911000	Yeah, well, whatever.
4912000	4916000	You look like somebody who just lost their father in a testicular accident.
4917000	4919000	Yeah, sure, whatever.
4920000	4922000	Did you get a chance to say goodbye?
4923000	4927000	I was there with him till the bitter end, held his hand, felt his soul slip away.
4929000	4934000	Wow. It's pretty deep. You think you'll be alright?
4940000	4946000	Or do I have to sit here and mirror you when I could be playing a video game?
4951000	4952000	Get in.
4953000	4954000	Alright, here we go.
4955000	4957000	Carry on my way, wordsong.
4958000	4959000	Alright, well that's an ending.
4964000	4965000	That was a... Alright, yeah.
4970000	4972000	And maybe that wasn't an after the credits. I mean, that was the rest of the movie.
4973000	4975000	If it had ended up, I'd be like, that was good, that was good.
4976000	4979000	But it couldn't have gone that long. It'd be like Barry Lyndon, you know?
4980000	4982000	There'd be an intermission in the middle.
4983000	4985000	You like that Barry Lyndon movie?
4986000	4987000	I haven't seen it.
4988000	4989000	Well, it drags a little bit.
4990000	4993000	They had a special film made for Stanley Kubrick because he...
4994000	4995000	Special lights.
4996000	4997000	He didn't want to light it.
4997000	4999000	No, it was special film too, special film stock.
5000000	5005000	Don't shake it. No, I saw it on the goddamn Tivo description or whatever you call it.
5006000	5007000	It's a film, film stock.
5008000	5009000	Now y'all better get your Googles out.
5010000	5011000	Everybody get their Googles out.
5012000	5014000	It was specifically like NASA.
5015000	5017000	I don't doubt that lenses were involved, for sure they would be.
5018000	5022000	But I also truly believe that I saw film stock, like that he had special film made.
5023000	5024000	Oh, that's probably, yeah. We'll tell him.
5025000	5026000	I heard the crafty was different.
5027000	5028000	It was shot right there.
5029000	5030000	Right.
5032000	5033000	Right.
5036000	5037000	That's what he just said.
5038000	5039000	You guys are obsessed with the lens.
5040000	5041000	I'm not taking the lens away from you.
5042000	5044000	It wasn't the film that had to change the camera.
5045000	5048000	They had to take the light care of the camera so that they could get the lens close enough to the film.
5049000	5052000	You guys are telling me all kinds of interesting stuff.
5053000	5055000	But what happened was I was called a liar for saying film stock.
5055000	5058000	I'm telling you, he had special film stock made.
5059000	5060000	I'm sure it had to be like special.
5061000	5062000	I'm pretty sure it was lens.
5063000	5064000	God damn it. It's not a dichotomy.
5065000	5067000	You can't give me film stock?
5070000	5072000	It's not a, why does it have to be either or?
5073000	5074000	You can't accept the world you're...
5075000	5076000	Let's go.
5077000	5079000	So what film stock did he shoot Barry Lyndon on?
5080000	5081000	You told me.
5081000	5087000	You know, the burden of proof is on me because I'm asserting that something was weird, right?
5088000	5089000	That's the rule.
5090000	5091000	Sorry, what?
5092000	5093000	50 millimeter film stock, Barry Lyndon.
5094000	5095000	The young Tommy Chong clone.
5100000	5102000	So does that mean different film stock?
5103000	5104000	But 15 millimeter, that sounds made up.
5105000	5107000	It's 35 millimeter.
5108000	5109000	You were both right.
5110000	5111000	And so I was right.
5112000	5114000	Because I never said they were wrong.
5115000	5118000	They're fucking millennial caught up in the, no, you're cute, Paul Ryan.
5119000	5120000	No.
5121000	5122000	We can all be naked.
5125000	5130000	I was, I knew, you know, it's not like I would see, I don't know anything about shooting stuff.
5131000	5135000	So I saw, I read the description of Barry Lyndon for me to perceive the words film stock.
5136000	5138000	I wouldn't have then like supplanted it if it said lens.
5139000	5140000	I would have said lens.
5141000	5142000	I'm not that gone yet.
5147000	5148000	I gave you your lens.
5149000	5150000	This is why you need bullies.
5155000	5156000	This is why bullying was invented.
5157000	5161000	Because two nerds will fight indefinitely until a bully comes along.
5162000	5163000	Shut up nerds.
5164000	5165000	What's up shorty?
5166000	5167000	Y'all nerds need to quit this shit.
5168000	5169000	Help me with my homework.
5170000	5172000	It wouldn't be the worst podcast ever if we were just allowed to.
5173000	5175000	But we could hang out and smoke a joint and talk about lenses all night.
5176000	5177000	I want to know though, what was it Heather Hooks?
5178000	5179000	It's both.
5180000	5181000	Of course it's both.
5182000	5185000	Of course you wouldn't change the lens and then keep the, no, I need that panamramma film stock.
5186000	5187000	But I just need to change the lens.
5188000	5189000	Fuck, that's crazy.
5192000	5193000	You can't give up.
5193000	5194000	He can't give up.
5195000	5196000	He can't give up.
5197000	5198000	You good.
5199000	5200000	You can't give up.
5201000	5202000	Well the film stock doesn't matter you're saying.
5203000	5204000	Wait, why would you say that though?
5205000	5206000	Why wouldn't the film stock matter?
5207000	5208000	Of course the film stock matters.
5209000	5210000	You're wrong bro.
5211000	5212000	I can tell by the look on your face.
5213000	5214000	You're wrong because you're not committed to your dissness.
5215000	5216000	No he's just so into lens.
5217000	5218000	I know he works for NASA.
5219000	5220000	But do he make the film for NASA?
5221000	5222000	He doesn't make film stock.
5224000	5227000	But nobody makes the film and he works because it was special film.
5229000	5230000	It's a special film stock.
5231000	5232000	Dan, Dave Klein just handed me his phone.
5233000	5237000	Kubrick was determined not to reproduce the set bound artificially lit look of other costume dramas from that time.
5238000	5240000	After tinkering with different combinations of lenses and film stock.
5241000	5247000	The production obtained three super fast 50 millimeter lenses developed by Zeiss for use by NASA.
5248000	5251000	So he experimented with film stock and it turned out to not work.
5256000	5257000	That sounded like...
5258000	5259000	They both write.
5260000	5261000	I'm willing to say I'm wrong.
5262000	5265000	These lenses were first developed by a website called legs lavish.
5277000	5278000	We should all go online and check it out.
5281000	5288000	I think probably everyone here saw maybe that clip of Ted Koppel talking to Sean Hannity is that his name?
5289000	5290000	I think you are bad.
5293000	5295000	But you think we're bad. You think we're bad. You think we're bad?
5296000	5297000	I do think we're bad.
5298000	5299000	Let me talk.
5300000	5301000	I ought to punch you in your young face.
5303000	5304000	And it was he did.
5304000	5308000	Ted Koppel is baller because he's the only person who stood up to that motherfucker on his show.
5309000	5311000	Well the 70s are baller now Woodward and Bernstein are out there.
5312000	5314000	He doesn't know what side to part his hair on. He doesn't give a shit.
5315000	5317000	Because we're living in this world that larger piece I was just watching in the green room.
5318000	5324000	There was like a larger thing that Ted Koppel did that was just about the fact that and we're tired of hearing this because what does it fucking mean?
5325000	5330000	But it's like the fact that our relationship with facts has become it's now subjective.
5330000	5334000	Like we live in a world now. Who would have ever thought this would be the result of the internet?
5335000	5338000	We all thought in the 90s we thought there's going to be all kinds of trouble.
5339000	5343000	But it's going to be because information is going to bleed all together.
5344000	5346000	We all anticipated all kinds of trouble.
5347000	5350000	Trouble like I don't know like kiddie porn will be easier.
5351000	5352000	People will be able to get away with crime more.
5353000	5356000	Then the government's going to want to clamp down and thought we'll be a crime.
5357000	5364000	It was all predicated. There was all this unspoken assumption that like like like that information had some kind of inherent value.
5365000	5374000	Like it was like gold or something like the truth could be known and that the truth was a thing that you could back the dollar with and you could back political accountability with.
5375000	5385000	But we've been slipping for a really long time into like and it's just so ironic that as the technology of communication increases you can actually it turns out the truth becomes.
5386000	5397000	Like a boring thing that only when you aerosol missed into a poison and blow it into people's eyes a certain way does it make them do things like the truth.
5398000	5405000	And we should have seen that coming because when we when I was a kid you'd watch the news and if the news anchor was like Nicaragua you'd be like boring flip.
5406000	5417000	That country's got a weird name and I'm like the truth is boring and that used to include things like health care and all this stuff and we're like we don't like like it's only people that mash it up and go like.
5418000	5428000	Boogeyman like like like that they're getting reactions and clicks and it's like I don't know what my point is I'm just shaking my cane and everything.
5428000	5436000	Did you see other people who showed up that had pizza gate t-shirts this weekend in Washington because they still believe that pizza gate is real.
5437000	5441000	Even though Alex Jones has come out and said yeah I apologize.
5442000	5457000	It's like it turns out whatever they told me when I was trying to make my dog not shit in the house and I was like by the way I didn't want to ever own a dog because I thought growing up in Milwaukee I thought in order to own a dog it meant you had to be mean to it because how else could you possibly train a dog.
5458000	5472000	To do things in turn and then I read books and all the stuff and I was like oh you don't you'd never have to have never my dogs never experienced any punishment it's only experience reward and it shits outside it does it's a totally thing I got off on a tangent there I'm a great dog owner.
5473000	5476000	I went to that breeder and I said give me a great dog.
5476000	5477000	Sorry.
5480000	5505000	But but but but the thing that I heard from the people that come over and go like I was like God damn it my my second dog was like you know he's harder to train he's like he's a little fucker and like like and and I started learning about dog training she's like you can't like people come home they see a turd and they think you take the dog's face and you look at the turd that dog doesn't know what that fucking turd is these dogs live in the moment like you got you got and she
5505000	5534000	she she was like they study this shit and there's like a there's a window of time during which a tiny little dog brain can learn it it'll it'll experience all kinds of shit and react to it and it'll seem like your dog's sentient but when it was as far as really like connecting something new like making a new thought it has to be so much in the moment that that's why trainers they they associate they go if you want to train your dog you it's like you click the clicking button.
5535000	5559000	Clicky thing so the dog can it can piggyback it could go the clicky thing means I did a good thing the clicky thing also means I get a peanut later whatever whatever dogs eat I don't know milk chocolate right dark dark chocolate they love dark chocolate if you're listening hey don't don't talk over me it's my podcast if you're training a dog at home get a funnel and a barrel of dark chocolate no.
5560000	5567000	Come back to hunt chicken bones chicken bones they love tiny but tiny chickens yeah yeah tiny chicken you have to sharpen them first yeah.
5568000	5588000	Hold them to a razor's edge no but for some reason the clicky thing is like the baby dog okay clicky thing means I'm owed a cookie I'll get a cookie later whatever they associate my point is okay so we're primates so our windows a little longer okay so Ben Franklin could take all that time to discover electricity and connect it to maybe I'll get laid if this key glows.
5588000	5606000	But like like we're we have a long term but we don't we call it centuries because we can connect dots from very far away we're like maybe if I get this car maybe if I blah blah blah it's like we can connect things like a little so much further that we think we're superior animals but we can't learn piano after 40 and.
5607000	5615000	Are you kidding me it's it's also it's a mathematical fact nothing nothing turns a woman on by more than a glowing key.
5616000	5634000	Fucking love that Franklin just rattling the key the the but but what that Ted Koppel thing awoke me to the fact that it was like a woke me what am I so you can't you can't learn I knew what you meant.
5635000	5660000	We we it only takes a certain amount of time before you can encounter something and then you decide it's true and you kind of it just like it kind of bakes into your your brain and we're all aware of the fact that facts are the kinds of things that can be like proven wrong and all this stuff but we but but that's different from things that we believe like we have like this kind of it's just sad really.
5661000	5676000	Because I know because where were we when we learned to be like whatever we are that kind of drives everything else we do because it's driving on how we consume information and then we were certain of things I feel like what we just saw with these lens Nazis.
5678000	5682000	For just to use it as an example it's a it's a thing lens Nazis.
5683000	5686000	I'm not saying you're anti-semitic I'm just saying if lenses were Jews.
5689000	5695000	Zeiss how motherfuckers I saw a film stock a film stock or choose you'd be like fuck the film stock does not matter.
5696000	5698000	It's the Zeiss the Zeiss.
5699000	5700000	I thought for NASA.
5702000	5707000	The rocket the rocket will take us to the thing I got your mind get shined on like that anyways.
5707000	5713000	What we saw was that I was a better person because I let them in I was like me.
5714000	5716000	I was like lenses for sure right.
5717000	5725000	And they were like yeah but fuck your film stock turned out I was wrong I think right didn't turn out we found out everybody was right.
5726000	5735000	Everybody everybody was right we were all right but we're not all right when it comes to whether or not you should have a horrible dictator in charge of your country who's like murder.
5736000	5749000	We're all having fun with the circus because we're going like oh health care and you look like a fool and here's the meme of you but dude fucking like are we ever going to get confirmation on whether that attack like kill and kill like two hundred fucking just regular people.
5750000	5764000	Like like we're all right like he just proud he's ran the whole time he never said he never said oh I think I'm going to do a little bit with this and a little bit with he said I'm going to fucking murder people I'm going to fucking kill Isis I'm going to step it up and we voted and voted.
5765000	5774000	And whatever blah blah blah now we're just we're murdering that was the shit that Obama did that he gets criticized for is like yeah this is part of being president you send a drone and like an Amazon thing.
5776000	5780000	There's a little half a mosque sorry we got the half a mosque sorry for the half a mosque.
5781000	5784000	Very difficult to draw down troops and not use drones.
5784000	5796000	And so now this dude is just like forget that nuclear button I mean don't forget it we're all going to die that way but like in the meantime there's a little morphine button that you just get hand a drone drone drone drone drone drone.
5797000	5803000	It's like he was going to put that in the drawer and now the drone drawer was already open though.
5803000	5821000	This is the thing like I don't fucking yeah I know it's like people are telling me oh Hillary and the emails and the Obama and Obama did this I already knew you can hear my podcast goes back years I was never like pro Obama while Obama was president I hate politicians they're fucking corrupt pieces of shit why did they become politicians.
5822000	5837000	Now we all miss this motherfucker I think it's like it's a corrupt politician who cares the country was working and there's a little bit of an admission there where you go like I don't care a little bit of like blood from poor people I'll never meet and was like oh it goes into my toilet paper and my butt feels so good.
5838000	5839000	We do have to own that.
5840000	5841000	Show Brandon your butthole.
5843000	5847000	I swear to God if I see a white man's butthole he doesn't need to.
5848000	5849000	Sorry what were you gonna say I derailed you.
5849000	5851000	Well I don't know I mean here's the thing.
5852000	5859000	It's not like politicians are uniformly shit it's that we you know we get politicians like we get artists or rock stars or singers some are great.
5860000	5870000	Some make you dance and they bring you together and you fucking celebrate when you see him and some people just sound like bullshit you don't want to hear their songs anymore and you want to turn them off but you give them the right to do what they do.
5870000	5885000	So I think you were talking about mirroring earlier and this is the deal is that if you do actually listen to people with what people are saying and you empathize you don't rely on the news as much because you hear on the ground what's actually going on.
5886000	5894000	If you actually listen to your neighbor talk to you about what's going on in their life and you know how hard it is for them you are mirroring you're listening to them.
5894000	5901000	But if you do that then you turn on the news and you see that unemployment is supposedly not as bad as it is then you know that's a fucking lie.
5902000	5904000	Same thing goes for when you listen to politicians.
5905000	5913000	I look at politicians in a very different way because I've always been a Democrat so I look at the Democratic Party as a totally different thing than just like a bunch of people lying.
5914000	5915000	That's it.
5915000	5923000	But what are we supposed to do in Los Feliz like go over to Amy Mann's house and find out she doesn't like the pothole and like where our neighborhood's doing okay.
5924000	5927000	Is it? I mean we have a ton of homeless in Los Feliz they live in the park.
5928000	5930000	I almost killed Amy Mann she was coming down.
5931000	5939000	She was coming around the corner on avocado and Commonwealth at the speed of light on a beach cruiser and she fucking almost drove right into my car.
5940000	5944000	And she would zoom right past me like I almost just like killed Amy Mann.
5945000	5949000	I saw you because she was like you almost killed me and you're like bitch don't tell me to hush hush.
5950000	5952000	You'll keep it down now.
5954000	5956000	I don't care whether your voice is carry or not.
5958000	5963000	That's a chill Tuesday reference only four people in this audience will get it's on the flash dance soundtrack you'll love it.
5965000	5967000	I just got kicked out of all the black sites.
5970000	5973000	What's going on in black Twitter can you tell me?
5975000	5976000	We're pretty quiet right now.
5977000	5978000	That's been our show.
5979000	5983000	We're just waiting to see what y'all do man we're not we're quiet.
5984000	5990000	How do I get into black Twitter is it like Hogwarts like do I have to like do I go to Twitter.
5991000	5993000	I think you have to walk through a doorway but you have to believe in it.
5994000	5996000	You have fans on black Twitter.
5996000	6004000	Well I mean if you if what you mean is that I have a handful of very very heroic black people that enjoy my work in my podcast.
6005000	6006000	That doesn't make black people heroes.
6007000	6012000	I'm biased but I feel like seasonings are what make black people heroes.
6015000	6016000	Seven original spices.
6018000	6022000	That is the kind of down home charm you'll only get on black Twitter.
6023000	6025000	If I said that it would be still be dismissive.
6026000	6028000	Last night I saved a motherfucker's life with some car.
6032000	6033000	I'm a hero.
6035000	6037000	All right. How do we how do we close a show like this. What's going on.
6038000	6039000	I think we just slowly walk away.
6040000	6044000	I still haven't picked up my gun. Now I'm afraid to expire to the guns expire.
6046000	6050000	If I do they like to get a gun man. I already did.
6051000	6053000	I'm still gonna rob you.
6056000	6059000	We have heart. It takes heart. You don't have heart.
6060000	6064000	I'm gonna be like don't shoot me dad I just want your shit please don't you dumb motherfucker you should have shot me.
6068000	6069000	I thought I was doing a hilarious.
6072000	6073000	You ain't got no heart man.
6075000	6078000	We had a meeting at Dan's house and Dan has Batman cameras everywhere.
6078000	6082000	It's like you can be in Dan's place and see like everybody walking up to the house.
6083000	6086000	So I came up knowing that Dan might be armed and like and I came up.
6088000	6090000	Hands in the air wearing a suit. Hands in the air.
6091000	6092000	Unbuttoned my suit. Sit up.
6093000	6097000	Turned around and I'm thinking that everybody be laughing inside watching it.
6098000	6099000	Nobody was. The cameras weren't on.
6101000	6103000	You should have said hands up nice suit.
6104000	6105000	Hands up nice suit.
6109000	6110000	No justice. No pleats.
6111000	6112000	No justice. No pleats.
6113000	6114000	No justice.
6114000	6115000	Free peace.
6120000	6122000	Three P's. I thought he said no pleats.
6122000	6123000	I said no pleats.
6123000	6124000	I said no pleats.
6124000	6125000	You said no pleats.
6126000	6132000	I don't I don't look I don't want to I don't want to tell you your job for you but I don't know what kind of laugh you're waiting for to close the show.
6133000	6134000	We're never going to recreate that.
6135000	6137000	Dan tell us a hilarious joke.
6139000	6142000	Maybe something racially charged. I don't know.
6143000	6144000	What do you got.
6144000	6154000	Okay a black guy and a white guy go into a bar together and the bartender is behind a curtain so you can't tell what race he is.
6157000	6158000	Sounds like a good bar.
6158000	6166000	And so you just hear a voice. He just says what would each of you like to drink.
6169000	6172000	And the white guy says why are you doing that voice.
6173000	6177000	And the bartender says I'm trying to disguise my voice.
6178000	6181000	I don't want you to know what race I am.
6182000	6186000	And the black guy is like he sounds to me Transylvanian.
6188000	6190000	And the white guy says that's not a race.
6191000	6193000	Now you're on to something.
6193000	6195000	What is a race.
6196000	6201000	And the white guy says I know what a race is and you give me a free drink if I can prove it.
6202000	6205000	The bartender says OK.
6205000	6209000	And the black guy says I'll I know what race is and I'll give you two.
6210000	6211000	I'll have two drinks.
6211000	6213000	I get two drinks if I prove it.
6214000	6217000	And the white guy takes his drink and he drinks it.
6217000	6228000	He says race is an amalgamation of geotypical phenotypical genetic traits coalesced into things and he goes on and on.
6229000	6232000	And the black guy says give me my two drinks.
6232000	6235000	And he takes it and he says race is an artificial construct.
6235000	6240000	And then he and then he takes the bar and he rips it like the Hulk out of the floor.
6241000	6244000	And he throws it through the wall.
6244000	6247000	And he tears down the curtain and the bartender is a dog.
