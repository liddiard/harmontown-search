0	26480	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the nerdest leader, Harbin Town, is now in
26480	27480	session.
27480	47840	Spencer Crittenden, everybody, Spencer, and the mayor of Harbin Town, Mr. Dan Harbin.
47840	49760	Thank you.
49760	53800	Thank you very much.
53800	54800	What's up, Dan?
54800	61280	I thought I had a new note-taking method, but I don't know if it's working very well.
61280	65480	Thanks for coming.
65480	67280	Those of you that did, is it a Mother's Day?
67280	71960	We got some late ticket sales, Mother's Day Game of Thrones, maybe?
71960	75080	It's not funny, you guys.
75080	76080	Did you call your mom today?
76080	79720	I threw her a text.
79720	80720	What was your text?
80720	85840	I said, I just text her a bunch of Game of Thrones spoilers.
85840	88840	She's the season behind.
88840	92600	She's like, what are you doing?
92600	93600	You're ruining everything.
93600	96040	I said, I didn't have to be born.
96040	98040	And then I hung up, even though it was text.
98040	100160	What do you think?
100160	101160	Are you Ironborn?
101160	105800	I am Ironborn, thank you for asking.
105800	110680	Man, that Game of Thrones, that's a tough game.
111680	114680	I can't tell who's winning, who's losing.
114680	116680	It's hard to keep track.
116680	118680	I think you either win or you die.
118680	120680	I don't even think you can lose.
120680	125680	I like the guy, now that, what's her name?
125680	130680	Cersei, who's the big fucker that's now her champion.
130680	131680	The Mountain.
131680	136680	And he's like a crazy zombie mountain guy, and he's just smashing dudes.
136680	138680	It's the best.
138680	142680	As promised, I kept thinking, are they really going there with that?
142680	144680	I guess that's what he's going to do.
144680	149680	I told you backstage last week that you asked about Jon Snow.
149680	151680	I said, he's going to get smoke-pussied.
151680	155680	And smoke-pussied is fucking, yeah, she did it.
155680	159680	It was a little more artisanal than that.
159680	162680	And I don't think that's a spoiler, because even people who...
162680	163680	She got smoke-pussied.
163680	165680	He got smoke-pussied.
165680	169680	He's been, Kit Harrington's been on the key art and all that stuff.
169680	171680	How was your week, Dan? What did you do?
171680	173680	I haven't talked to you in a while.
173680	176680	You know, I've been working, man.
176680	178680	It's unremarkable.
178680	180680	This is going to be a terrible show, by the way.
180680	181680	A terrible show.
181680	182680	All you do is work now.
182680	184680	You work, work, work, work, work.
184680	185680	That's why it's going to be terrible.
185680	188680	And when I'm not working, I've acquired this horrible habit.
188680	197680	I headlong into a horrible, debilitating addiction to incremental tap games.
197680	198680	Now I know what they're called.
198680	199680	That was the first step.
199680	201680	Somebody said, oh, incremental tappers.
201680	203680	And I was like, incremental tappers?
203680	206680	That's these games that I've just descended.
206680	207680	Now I just have five games.
207680	209680	I switch back and forth between them.
209680	212680	On my iPad, it was just like, you just tap a cookie.
212680	216680	And then you make nine cookies, and then you can get a super cookie.
216680	218680	And then you just keep tapping the super cookie, or whatever.
218680	220680	You just build a bakery.
220680	224680	And then it's just like, if you hit a plateau, it's like, oh,
224680	228680	it looks like it's going to take an hour to build to super chocolate chip level.
228680	231680	And then you switch over to a thing where you're on a moon,
231680	233680	and you just keep hitting the crater.
233680	234680	And it's like, fucking things.
234680	237680	And then you make a bulldozer to like, it's insane.
237680	238680	It's insane.
238680	239680	There's three games.
239680	243680	Tap titans, I keep switching between that.
243680	247680	And I think the same people make tap tycoon.
247680	251680	These are quality tap games, but they're bad for your life.
251680	256680	And then tap galaxy, which is more of an 8-bit affair, where you just...
256680	258680	Talk me through tap tycoon.
258680	259680	What goes on there?
259680	261680	Tap tycoon, you're a little guy.
261680	264680	Remember I told you guys about the adventure capitalist
264680	266680	where you just hit the buttons that represent the businesses?
266680	268680	Well, this one's a little more stylized graphically.
268680	270680	There's a little guy.
270680	273680	And then if you tap the Arab of him, dollars for him,
273680	277680	and he grabs him and stuffs him in his little pockets.
277680	280680	And then over time you can buy businesses,
280680	282680	and it's really just the same game,
282680	284680	but it's just like there's a little dude jumping around.
284680	287680	So you really are just tapping things.
287680	289680	Yeah, you really do just tap.
289680	292680	And obviously, if my therapist were here, she would say,
292680	295680	so in other words, you've found a way to keep your wheels spinning
295680	297680	with reduced accountability.
297680	300680	There's no chance of choosing right or wrong.
300680	303680	There's no humans to interact with or disappoint.
303680	305680	Like, it's amazing.
305680	308680	Even a regular video game would be too much.
308680	310680	Like, now I've been reduced to just...
310680	312680	I'm just freebasing dopamine.
312680	313680	I'm just like...
313680	315680	And I got up in my...
315680	320680	I was in New York through the weekend, and I was hung over.
320680	324680	I had a wonderful time with my lover, and we have a great time.
324680	328680	But then I sat up, and I looked in the mirror that was next to the bed,
328680	331680	and I said, oh, my God, I'm a gorilla.
331680	335680	And someone should just teach me sign language.
335680	339680	I bet it would be easier for me to learn sign language.
339680	342680	All right.
342680	346680	So my chiropractor, you know, every time I miss a session,
346680	348680	he texts me...
348680	349680	What does he say?
349680	352680	He texts me, too.
352680	353680	He texts both of us.
353680	354680	For real?
354680	355680	Yeah, yeah.
355680	357680	He group texts you?
357680	358680	No, no.
358680	361680	He texts us most separately.
361680	362680	Let's see.
362680	363680	I'm trying to find his...
363680	364680	Oh, okay.
364680	365680	Hi.
365680	366680	This is what I got.
366680	368680	You can't see this, but it's all the same.
368680	370680	They all say,
370680	371680	Hi, Dan.
371680	373680	You missed your appointment today at 9.30.
373680	377680	Will you be able to make it up on Thursday at 9.30?
377680	378680	Doctor...
378680	382680	And I wish I could tell you his name, because you'd be like, what?
382680	384680	Is it a funny name?
384680	387680	Well, it's his first name, so it's like...
387680	391680	It's like Dr. Gary, but it's worse.
391680	393680	It's like, oi.
393680	396680	Mine is Dr. Doug.
396680	398680	He looks like a sexy George Clooney.
398680	399680	When do these guys get...
399680	401680	A sexy George Clooney?
401680	403680	He looks sexier than George...
403680	404680	He's sexier than George Clooney.
404680	405680	How do you...
405680	406680	I can't even picture that.
406680	407680	I know.
407680	408680	And then he gives you...
408680	410680	He cracks your back, and you're like,
410680	412680	This fucking sexy George Clooney just fucked me up.
412680	413680	This is the best.
413680	415680	How come these guys get to call themselves doctors
415680	417680	as long as they don't use a last name?
417680	419680	That seems problematic.
419680	421680	Oh, by the way, problematic.
421680	422680	I...
422680	425680	I had a delightful conversation with a millennial
425680	428680	that brought me another step further into my relationship,
428680	430680	atoning with them.
430680	433680	This person, everything about them on paper,
433680	436680	it should have been just a bad evening of talking to them,
436680	439680	because they're getting their degree,
439680	444680	and it's just something that suggests that the world is fucked.
444680	446680	No, it was actually something very interesting.
446680	448680	It was transatlantic colonial literature,
448680	451680	but I wanted to be funny, and I wasn't.
451680	453680	But she was talking about...
453680	455680	We were talking about...
455680	457680	Because she's studying literature,
457680	459680	particularly with a view on,
459680	461680	because it's the slavery period,
461680	463680	it's imperialism, colonialism,
463680	466680	and that's what she's mostly interested in.
466680	468680	And so we were talking about slavery
468680	471680	within the literature, mythology, and all this stuff.
471680	475680	And she used this verb that I'd never heard before.
475680	477680	She was like, well, I just, you know...
477680	479680	And what I'm trying to do with my latest paper
479680	481680	is I'm problematizing this and this and that, problematizing.
481680	483680	And I was like, wait, wait.
483680	485680	You're problematizing.
485680	486680	And she's like, yeah.
486680	488680	And I'm like, wait, oh, shit.
488680	491680	I got really excited, because she...
491680	493680	And I said, I don't really ever hear the word problematic.
493680	495680	And she's like, yeah, problematic.
495680	498680	Problematizing is the act of making something problematic.
498680	500680	It's figuring out that it is.
500680	502680	And I was like, yeah, but that's so much better.
502680	504680	And she goes, I know, because it's something I do
504680	506680	and not something that you're pointing at
506680	507680	and saying that is something.
507680	508680	I was like, yes, yes.
508680	509680	God damn it.
509680	513680	You could just smile and say, I love problematizing.
513680	516680	And you wouldn't come off like such a fucking jag-off.
516680	518680	You know?
518680	520680	I enjoy problematizing.
520680	524680	That's why I'm so goddamn happy.
524680	526680	It's a thing I like to do.
526680	528680	It's like the equivalent of vandalism.
528680	532680	Only instead of a brick wall, it's your buzz, you know?
532680	533680	Like, it's fun.
533680	534680	I'm going to put my mark on it.
534680	536680	I like to problematize.
536680	538680	And it's actually...
538680	539680	And I looked it up.
539680	540680	You know, it's a real thing.
540680	544680	And I was like, wait, okay, yeah, problematization.
544680	548680	You can't say it if you've had a single drink.
548680	551680	But it's to consider the concrete or existential elements
551680	555680	of a term, writing, opinion, ideology, identity, or person
555680	560680	as challenges, problems, that invite people involved
560680	562680	to transform those situations.
562680	566680	It's a method of defamiliarization of common sense.
566680	570680	See, that sounds punk rock and lateral and inventive
570680	571680	and interesting.
571680	573680	I think what we can't...
573680	575680	So how do I problematize something?
575680	577680	What does that mean?
577680	579680	Well, let's problematize Mother's Day.
579680	580680	All right.
580680	581680	Okay, well...
581680	582680	Finally.
582680	584680	Well, they list...
584680	585680	I mean, this isn't...
585680	586680	Nobody's...
586680	588680	It would be problematic to tell you how to problematize,
588680	589680	but they...
589680	592680	Because who are you, you know?
592680	595680	Oh, Wikipedia is telling me how to problematize.
595680	600680	But the process is sort of to ask the questions.
600680	602680	Who is making this statement?
602680	604680	For whom is he or she making it?
604680	606680	Why is the statement being made here?
606680	608680	And now, whom does this statement benefit?
608680	609680	Whom does it harm?
609680	612680	That's a good way of picking something apart.
612680	616680	Especially, though, what I really like is the invitation
616680	619680	of people involved to transform something,
619680	621680	and I think that's what gets left out a lot.
621680	623680	I think that if you're...
623680	625680	So to problematize Mother's Day, you'd say,
625680	627680	like, you'd have to ask, like,
627680	629680	well, who came up with Mother's Day, you know?
629680	631680	That would require some research
631680	632680	or a bunch of assumptions.
632680	633680	A hallmark, right?
633680	634680	I don't know, man.
635680	636680	You'd have to look it up.
636680	639680	That's the other problem, is that a lot of problematization
639680	642680	seems to be a kind of hobby.
642680	644680	When it's based on zero research,
644680	646680	then you're all the way into just kind of saying,
646680	650680	like, hey, this sketch offended me.
650680	653680	Like, who is making this sketch?
653680	656680	Well, you're either going to say the writers,
656680	658680	and then you've got to get into all kinds of problematic,
658680	661680	like, conversations about...
661680	662680	Was it a black writer?
662680	663680	Was it a white writer?
663680	665680	If it was, for instance, like a sketch that was like,
665680	667680	the black news, and it was pointing out
667680	669680	that black people have a different point of view.
669680	671680	And it's like, so then you're like,
671680	674680	now you're bringing a bag in there into that airport
674680	676680	and, like, unloading it,
676680	679680	or you have to be so vague that it doesn't sound as provocative.
679680	681680	Like, you'd have to go, just people,
681680	683680	like, or just the media.
683680	685680	The media is at it again.
685680	688680	The media is talking to whom?
688680	691680	The underclass, the impressionable black people,
691680	693680	white people, the audience, just people.
693680	694680	I don't know.
694680	696680	You'd have to, like, be subjective and speculate
696680	700680	and assume, or you'd have to, like, just be really vague
700680	702680	and say, there's a box in my living room
702680	703680	that I don't know how it works.
703680	706680	And I read some stuff online about kind of how it works.
706680	708680	So I'm making some assumptions about maybe the intention
708680	711680	of this thing, and I'm kind of problematizing it.
711680	715680	I think the danger there is the obviously problematizing
715680	719680	while fun, and I think it's great to say I love doing it.
720680	723680	I think that kind of, like, it obviously doesn't invite discourse.
723680	725680	So this is the problem that you see online all the time.
725680	728680	It's just, like, it's the white Redditor going, like,
728680	730680	actually, actually, and, like, trying to problematize
730680	733680	the problematization that's being brought up problematically
733680	735680	because everyone's, because you can't, if you,
735680	737680	if somebody tells you that you're,
737680	739680	because remember, to problematize something
739680	741680	is not to ask a question.
741680	744680	It's not to provide any information.
744680	747680	It's actually, just to put it in the most simple terms,
748680	751680	it's to take something that everyone is assuming in the room
751680	754680	and then to start to ask, why are we assuming this,
754680	756680	which is very healthy if you're dealing with, for instance,
756680	759680	the Catholic Church saying, like, no, this isn't a pedophile,
759680	761680	and ask the question, is it?
761680	764680	And then you go, oh, look at that, it is.
764680	766680	But there's some research involved there,
766680	769680	and there's some, and there's that invitation to transform.
769680	771680	It's like, what are we going to do about this?
771680	775680	But if you, so if you invite somebody to transform
776680	778680	circumstances that they're assuming,
778680	781680	in a negative way, that could be somebody sitting in a room
781680	784680	and they're wearing a hat, and you just go,
784680	786680	you should take that hat off,
786680	789680	because I'm looking at your hat in a different way,
789680	791680	and I've found it problematic,
791680	794680	and not only am I just complaining about it,
794680	797680	I'm actually also inviting you, the person involved with your hat,
797680	800680	to transform, to partake part in this transformation.
800680	803680	Now, the problem there, and maybe your hat has a swastika on it,
803680	806680	so this is a good thing, maybe, if maybe you're in a synagogue.
806680	810680	Like, there is context, and context, and context.
810680	812680	Maybe your hat is genuinely problematic.
812680	816680	The problematic nature of problematization, inherently,
816680	820680	is that if that person isn't wearing a swastika on their hat,
820680	823680	and you aren't in a synagogue, they're just a dude with a hat on.
823680	828680	So if they say anything at all, you're already in a conflict,
828680	830680	you've set the table for conflict.
830680	833680	That's why it's probably called problematization,
833680	836680	not because you're just finding them, you're causing problems.
836680	838680	You're saying, take your hat off,
838680	841680	and if the person ignores you, they're a fucking asshole.
841680	845680	And if they say, I have a problem with your problematization of my hat,
845680	848680	then they're, you know, hat-splaining to you.
848680	850680	Um...
850680	854680	And if somebody starts problematizing your problematization,
854680	856680	what are you gonna do? Stop and go, you're right,
856680	859680	problematization is very problematic, I'll stop it immediately.
859680	863680	No, you're going to say, stop hat-splaining my problematization,
863680	865680	I'm trying to do something.
865680	867680	So it's not really an activity...
867680	870680	I'm so confused, I still don't know...
870680	874680	Well, it's not a group activity, problematization, so...
874680	879680	What you problematize, is it an active thing?
879680	882680	It's a method of criticism.
882680	883680	Right.
883680	886680	It's an algorithm for criticism, maybe put it that way.
886680	887680	Is it good or is it bad?
887680	893680	I think it's good one time per conversation at the top of it,
893680	897680	and needs to be heavily mitigated with the expectation
897680	899680	that somebody might tell you to go fuck yourself
899680	902680	because you haven't done any research
902680	904680	and don't know what you're talking about.
904680	907680	Because it takes a really, really, really long time
907680	910680	to see a sketch on a television show,
910680	914680	to go from there to writing an essay about it,
914680	916680	requires more than typing, I think,
916680	919680	unless you're going to just make people laugh.
919680	922680	If you're really going to try to make people think
922680	924680	and provide new information,
924680	926680	you're going to have to call somebody
926680	928680	at the production office of that show
928680	930680	and ask who wrote this?
930680	931680	What were the circumstances?
931680	933680	Where did the sketch originate from?
933680	934680	How is your show structured?
934680	936680	What does your writer's room look like?
936680	938680	Was there rewrites on this thing?
938680	940680	How did it end up being this particular sketch?
940680	943680	Then you have to go around and find out how people received it
943680	944680	and what happened,
944680	947680	and then you have to still bring in all kinds of speculation
947680	949680	about who benefited and who's suffering.
949680	952680	I mean, all those things are going to be really subjective.
952680	953680	Now, here's the thing.
953680	955680	There are situations in which it's not subjective at all
955680	956680	and it's really easy,
956680	959680	and those things seem to be like, you know,
959680	961680	are Teflon for problemization.
961680	964680	Like, God damn it, I hate this fucking word.
964680	967680	Donald Trump comes pre-problematized.
967680	969680	You can't fucking touch the guy.
969680	970680	He's a Rubik's Cube,
970680	972680	and all the colors are the same on every side.
973680	976680	If a senator says,
976680	979680	if a senator says,
979680	983680	arts education is a waste of money in urban schools
983680	986680	because urban kids tend to get urban jobs,
986680	988680	you can problematize the shit out of that
988680	991680	and start talking about how urban probably means black
991680	992680	and blah, blah, blah.
992680	994680	If someone says all Mexicans are rapists,
994680	997680	you have nothing to do but go fly a kite.
998680	1001680	He's like, who's making this statement?
1001680	1002680	Donald Trump.
1002680	1003680	To whom is he making it?
1003680	1004680	Trump supporters.
1004680	1005680	Why is he making it?
1005680	1006680	To get votes.
1006680	1007680	Who's suffering?
1007680	1008680	Mexicans.
1008680	1009680	Who's gaining?
1009680	1010680	Angry white people.
1010680	1011680	You're done.
1011680	1013680	There's nothing to do.
1013680	1016680	And the danger of that is that if we're addicted as a culture
1016680	1018680	to problematizing as an activity,
1018680	1021680	it might just be that we think that when we're done doing that,
1021680	1023680	we're done doing everything,
1023680	1025680	and that we don't then do what, you know,
1025680	1027680	Woodward and Bernstein did,
1027680	1028680	which is take down a fucking dude.
1028680	1029680	Take him down.
1029680	1030680	Look shit up in books.
1030680	1032680	Go meet with people in parking garages.
1032680	1037680	But how do you take somebody down who takes himself down constantly?
1037680	1039680	Well, there's got to be shit that this guy...
1039680	1041680	I mean, it's got to be all the worse.
1041680	1042680	The guy is a pathological liar.
1042680	1043680	I don't know.
1043680	1048680	I mean, I saw that Vanity Fair piece from the 90s.
1048680	1049680	I don't know.
1049680	1050680	It's all out there.
1050680	1052680	It's like he had Hitler's speeches next to his bed.
1052680	1053680	I guess you're right.
1053680	1055680	No, I don't know what to do.
1055680	1056680	There's got to be a way.
1056680	1057680	There's got to be a way to find out
1057680	1059680	or to figure out that we don't have to.
1059680	1060680	I was at DDoS today.
1060680	1063680	DDoS had a barbecue, and there was these...
1063680	1064680	Donald Trump was there.
1064680	1066680	These directors were there,
1066680	1068680	and one of the directors was saying,
1068680	1074680	the guy that's doing the Albert Brooks and Louis C. K. thing,
1074680	1076680	and these guys were there.
1076680	1077680	One of the guys says,
1077680	1081680	apparently Hitler was really into poop.
1081680	1086680	He and Eva Braun, their housekeeper had to keep changing their sheets
1086680	1089680	because every time they got together, there was shit everywhere.
1089680	1096680	He was saying, apparently Hitler was really into scat play and pooping.
1096680	1100680	And Dina goes, don't ruin Hitler for me.
1105680	1107680	Meaning don't dimensionalize him.
1107680	1110680	Keep him Dracula for me.
1110680	1112680	He's just like a character.
1112680	1117680	It's like the girl with the skunk hair and the Archie's.
1117680	1118680	Hitler's here.
1118680	1119680	He wants the band to fail.
1119680	1121680	That's it.
1121680	1125680	Don't tell me when he goes home he has interesting things going on.
1125680	1128680	We keep finding out that Hitler had a micropenis.
1128680	1129680	He had one testicle.
1129680	1132680	He likes to poop on people.
1132680	1136680	He was just a bad guy.
1136680	1138680	He peed on his nephew.
1138680	1139680	He what?
1139680	1140680	He peed on his nephew.
1140680	1144680	His nephew says somebody in the crowd.
1144680	1146680	Is that verifiable evidence?
1146680	1149680	That's not verified, but it's a common rule.
1149680	1152680	He peed on his nephew.
1152680	1154680	Under what circumstances?
1154680	1157680	Sexually.
1157680	1160680	All right, now.
1160680	1166680	Who is making this statement?
1166680	1169680	Dan, are you going to problematize that statement?
1169680	1171680	The kind of Hitler hater.
1171680	1173680	For whom is he or she making it?
1173680	1177680	Do you know why Hitler killed himself?
1177680	1179680	I don't know.
1179680	1185680	He saw his gas bill.
1185680	1187680	It's true.
1187680	1188680	It's true.
1188680	1192680	He said that he offers up.
1192680	1201680	It's a verifiable, unproblematizable fact.
1201680	1204680	Yeah, whatever.
1204680	1207680	That was a bad Hitler joke.
1207680	1209680	It's a great Hitler joke.
1209680	1210680	Here's why.
1210680	1214680	No, it takes the actual gas part and it trivializes it.
1214680	1216680	That is problematic.
1216680	1219680	So there.
1219680	1225680	The funny Hitler jokes are like, oh, do you know why he never drank?
1225680	1226680	Why?
1226680	1228680	He was an angry drunk.
1228680	1230680	Not as funny as the gas one.
1230680	1233680	I don't tell jokes very well.
1233680	1237680	When you use Hitler as an Abe Lincoln or a Dracula,
1237680	1240680	where it's just like, oh, you have to invite him in before he can come in.
1240680	1242680	Hitler has those little rules.
1242680	1245680	But then the actual minutia of the extermination,
1245680	1251680	and then in addition to that, taking that and going like, oh, what a Monday.
1251680	1256680	All right.
1256680	1258680	But with any joke when you walk through this process,
1258680	1260680	I don't know if this is a flip track, who is making the statement?
1260680	1261680	Someone telling a joke.
1261680	1262680	Who are they making it?
1262680	1263680	An audience.
1263680	1264680	Why is the statement being made?
1264680	1265680	The person is trying to be funny.
1265680	1266680	Who does it hurt?
1266680	1267680	Who does it benefit?
1267680	1268680	Anyone that laughs.
1268680	1269680	Who does it hurt?
1269680	1270680	Anyone that doesn't.
1270680	1272680	I mean, that's kind of been known for a while.
1272680	1274680	It's not going to get you anywhere either, is it?
1274680	1275680	What's your current favorite joke?
1275680	1280680	Or all problematization is like, who's problematizing?
1280680	1281680	Academics.
1281680	1282680	For whom are they doing it?
1282680	1283680	Academics.
1283680	1285680	Why are they doing it here and now?
1285680	1292680	For academia, possibly to justify the existence of academia.
1292680	1293680	Who does that benefit?
1293680	1295680	Academics.
1295680	1296680	Who does it hurt?
1296680	1303680	People who would otherwise maybe do shit?
1304680	1305680	Okay.
1305680	1308680	But, you know, that's just me dumsplaining.
1308680	1311680	Spencer, did you talk to your mom today?
1311680	1312680	Oh, yeah.
1312680	1314680	I mean, I texted her.
1314680	1315680	Yeah.
1315680	1316680	Sure.
1316680	1317680	What did you say?
1317680	1320680	I said, Happy Mother's Day.
1320680	1321680	No, I don't know.
1321680	1326680	She texted me a couple days ago and was like, am I going to see you on Mother's Day?
1326680	1330680	It's just like one of these things where it's like, oh, I guess I'm not going to text you
1330680	1332680	for two or three days.
1332680	1335680	So it's just like, I don't want that, man.
1335680	1336680	I don't need that.
1336680	1337680	You're texting me.
1337680	1339680	Am I going to see you texting me?
1339680	1342680	And, you know, that's what I want to know.
1342680	1344680	I don't want to know that.
1344680	1345680	I don't know.
1345680	1346680	It just sucks, man.
1346680	1347680	It sucks.
1347680	1348680	I hate my parents.
1348680	1349680	I hate my family.
1349680	1351680	I hate everything.
1351680	1352680	It's no good.
1352680	1354680	My grandpa's dead.
1354680	1355680	He's fine.
1355680	1356680	No.
1356680	1358680	I mean, he's dead, but he's fine.
1358680	1359680	Like, no, it's fine.
1359680	1362680	Was he fine before he was dead, or he's fine now that he is dead?
1362680	1365680	He's fine now that he's dead, yeah.
1365680	1366680	So I don't know.
1366680	1368680	You're not pals with your parents at all?
1368680	1369680	No, no.
1369680	1370680	They were...
1370680	1371680	They were...
1371680	1372680	No.
1372680	1373680	No.
1373680	1374680	They were...
1374680	1376680	No, no.
1376680	1377680	Yeah, no.
1377680	1382680	Do you think there's a day that you might be, like, come back around to be friends with
1382680	1383680	us?
1383680	1387680	I feel like these are the times that it would be happening, and I'm really going in the
1388680	1389680	opposite direction.
1389680	1392680	So, I mean, I got to figure that out if I want that to happen.
1392680	1395680	What would have to happen for you to become friends with them?
1395680	1396680	I don't know, man.
1396680	1397680	It's just...
1397680	1398680	It's so much...
1398680	1400680	It's all, like, nickel and dime shit, you know?
1400680	1402680	It's not, like, some big falling out happened.
1402680	1405680	It's just, like, this happens all the time, and this happens all the time.
1405680	1408680	And at the end of the day, it's like, I don't want most of that.
1408680	1410680	So I'm here, you know?
1410680	1412680	That's why I'm here.
1412680	1416680	I think, like, back in the old days when we first met you, that you felt, like, kind of
1416680	1420680	responsible for their relationship and kind of, like, you're kind of a caretaker, right?
1420680	1422680	Sure, yeah, I think I said that.
1422680	1424680	Is that still the case or no?
1424680	1426680	No, I mean, well, my dad lives in Columbia.
1426680	1429680	I mean, he probably has a girlfriend or something right now.
1429680	1434680	He's taking care of himself, and my mom, she's, like, a hobo or something.
1434680	1437680	She's, like, couch surfing and traveling and stuff.
1437680	1440680	She doesn't have a stable residence as far as I'm aware.
1440680	1443680	So, I mean, who knows?
1443680	1445680	Who knows, right?
1445680	1447680	You know what my big thing with family is?
1447680	1449680	You don't like them.
1449680	1453680	At some point, there was this syndrome that started happening where it was, like, well,
1453680	1456680	I haven't talked to these people in a while.
1456680	1461680	And then it's, like, now I'm 43, so they're getting long in the tooth.
1461680	1469680	Like, we're getting to the point where after a long life of, like, fruitfulness and tradition
1469680	1474680	and stuff, you're supposed to, like, partake of this tragic, like, third act where it's, like,
1474680	1476680	bittersweet, you know?
1476680	1477680	Yeah.
1477680	1482680	I don't want to even, you know, part of me, like, just because of our kind of stigma
1482680	1486680	against, like, you know, sickness and stuff like that.
1486680	1490680	I don't want to say certain words out loud, because I'll sound, like, just the epitome of evil.
1490680	1496680	But, like, I just have this, like, weird feeling about, like, well, I don't even know these people
1496680	1499680	at this point, and I'm going to start now?
1499680	1500680	Yeah.
1500680	1502680	Because now is a bad time to start.
1502680	1503680	And it's, like, and for what?
1503680	1505680	For the benefits of family?
1505680	1509680	Because I feel like I've been cruising without that just fine all this time.
1509680	1511680	And, you know, it's all been good.
1511680	1516680	So now I want to go into that morass just because that's what happens on television.
1516680	1517680	Like, it seems dumb.
1517680	1523680	And a little bit of a slight, right, if you didn't get, like, the whole, like, other side of it?
1523680	1527680	Or it's, like, your family means a lot to you.
1527680	1535680	Throwing the ball in the yard, Thanksgiving times, AT&T wants you to be there.
1535680	1539680	This holiday season, when the gravy's up and the stockings are out,
1539680	1542680	bring your nuzzles around the Christmas tree.
1542680	1545680	It's, like, when it's really just more dysfunctional than that.
1545680	1549680	You're just kind of, like, then you're supposed to get that.
1549680	1552680	Like, the cable knit sweaters and the golden retrievers and the, like,
1552680	1556680	oh, dad, dad's going to do his chaplain impression again.
1556680	1564680	Like, I love it when we come up to this cabin in the Hamptons of every winter.
1564680	1566680	And sure, we have our problems.
1566680	1571680	And remember when Gloria smoked weed and sent her to rehab, but now she's okay.
1571680	1577680	Oh, the McClanahan clan keeps getting bigger and happier.
1578680	1584680	And then, if you've got, if you had all that, then bring on the fucking diagnoses.
1584680	1587680	And the, uh-oh, I got to go away for the weekend.
1587680	1588680	Meep, beep.
1588680	1591680	Like, I always wanted to do more.
1591680	1594680	I know, but you did, Uncle Herman.
1597680	1602680	But if Uncle Herman was like, meh, you know, why get on board right before the meep-meep?
1602680	1603680	Yeah.
1605680	1606680	Exactly.
1606680	1609680	Because it's just been, it's like just a flat line up until that point.
1609680	1614680	It's like, how, how, what, what is the peak that we're hoping to achieve before the inevitable pitfall?
1614680	1615680	Yeah.
1615680	1617680	What is this denouement that I'm getting?
1617680	1619680	It's, it's, it's like, it's like, yeah.
1619680	1626680	It's like if you went to see a Matrix movie and it was just about Keanu Reeves, like, fighting a million Agent Smiths.
1626680	1629680	So you'd be like, what's this weird educational video?
1630680	1634680	Like, someone would have to explain to you, there was a first movie and it was kind of fun.
1638680	1643680	If you met, uh, Dan, like, if you met your mother or your father at a bar, like, there were strangers,
1643680	1645680	do you think that you would have anything to talk about?
1645680	1649680	Like, if, if you just met them face value as strangers?
1649680	1652680	Yeah, I think I'd, I think I'd like my dad, you know?
1652680	1653680	Yeah.
1653680	1656680	You, you could have a chat, you could, uh, enjoy each other's company.
1656680	1657680	Yeah.
1658680	1661680	It's a bad way to spend Mother's Day talking about it.
1661680	1663680	I think my dad's a cool guy.
1663680	1665680	Not, not your mom though?
1665680	1670680	Well, with my mom, but my mom, it's more important to be like, I mean, it's like, this is, and I think moms get a bum rap.
1670680	1673680	I think it's the, I think it's an opposite gender kid kind of thing too.
1673680	1683680	It's also, but like, you know, I think moms get a bum rap from the male kids because they nurture and they, they, they, they, they, they are there.
1683680	1691680	And then ironically, you kind of, you know, you cut the strings and you kind of, you don't look back and go like, what a pal.
1691680	1705680	You look back and go like, you know, goddess monster, you know, in any case, not a human, you know, like you really need to, you really need to have like a human relationship with your family or, or it's, or you're not going to have one.
1705680	1708680	And that's a statement that's really powerful.
1709680	1713680	But then again, you know, and everybody I talked to always goes like, we always end this conversation.
1713680	1716680	We go like, yeah, but have you met those people with the, like the loving Norman Rockwell family?
1716680	1718680	Yeah. Not funny people.
1718680	1721680	Like, like just, just really annoying.
1721680	1726680	When your mom passes away, what do you feel like there'll be a loss?
1726680	1729680	Like something will be subtracted from you?
1729680	1733680	I think this is a bad day to say anything, but yes.
1733680	1734680	Well, what?
1734680	1737680	Well, cause just on the off chance that she's like, well, it's Mother's Day.
1737680	1739680	He'll probably say something about me.
1739680	1742680	And then you're like, when she dies, will you feel anything?
1742680	1750680	Hmm. So yes, it'll be different than when you, than when your father passes away.
1750680	1753680	I think there's going to be complicated feelings either way.
1753680	1756680	But I do acknowledge that they're going to be more narcissistically centered.
1756680	1760680	You know, they're not, they're going to be like unresolved shit that I haven't worked on.
1761680	1763680	My mom, my mom died when I was 13.
1763680	1770680	And it's like, that was like kind of the perfect time for that to happen because I wasn't so young.
1770680	1774680	I didn't know her, but I wasn't so old that it meant a lot more.
1774680	1781680	But when I look at, when I remember my mother, she's so much of who I am.
1781680	1785680	Like as much as I'm genetically my father, I look just like my dad.
1785680	1788680	I am intellectually my mother.
1788680	1791680	Like I have all of her emotions, like her brain.
1791680	1800680	And it's like, when I think of my mom today, she was so fucking funny.
1800680	1801680	She was so cool.
1801680	1803680	And I didn't know her long enough.
1803680	1805680	Like, you know, I was 13.
1805680	1808680	So she was kind of hard going.
1808680	1813680	Like it was a little bit heavy to be around my mom because she was that intense.
1813680	1817680	But I wish she was still around because she was like the funniest person I ever knew.
1819680	1825680	My mom got me my first typewriter, my first Commodore 64.
1825680	1830680	She always made sure she told me whenever I said, what should I do?
1830680	1832680	She always said, do whatever you want.
1832680	1836680	She never said, you have to be this or that.
1836680	1838680	You know, she never had a career plan for me.
1838680	1845680	She always said, just make sure you do it because you want to do it and make sure you're really good at it.
1845680	1848680	If you're going to be a garbage man, no offense to the garbage man listening.
1848680	1850680	That's the example she would use.
1850680	1855680	If you're going to be a garbage man, just be the best garbage man that there is and make sure you're happy doing it.
1855680	1857680	So she was super on your side.
1857680	1860680	Also she threw things at you.
1860680	1864680	She usually throwing them at my dad and I would get in the way.
1864680	1866680	Like my birthday cake.
1869680	1870680	But it was carrot cake.
1870680	1871680	I didn't even want it.
1872680	1876680	Carrot cake is a Lexus of cakes?
1876680	1881680	I would give up a thousand birthday cakes for the story I got,
1881680	1885680	which is my mom threw my 11th birthday cake at my dad.
1887680	1892680	I would give up cake forever to have that story be true, which it is.
1892680	1895680	And then she's like, here's your D&D books.
1895680	1897680	I didn't have time to wrap them.
1897680	1899680	And I was like, that's fine, man.
1899680	1901680	This is awesome.
1901680	1902680	All right.
1902680	1904680	Well, let's bring out our guests.
1904680	1906680	We can continue to talk about this.
1906680	1910680	Let's bring some more dudes out here.
1910680	1913680	If the show's lacking anything, it's more dude.
1913680	1915680	It's dude energy.
1915680	1919680	These guys have a very popular feral audio podcast.
1919680	1923680	It's like, I don't know if you care about such things, but it's number five.
1923680	1924680	I happen to know that.
1924680	1926680	It's like the fifth most popular feral audio podcast.
1926680	1927680	Where are we?
1927680	1928680	I don't know.
1928680	1930680	I don't care about these top.
1930680	1931680	We're number one.
1931680	1932680	One or two.
1932680	1933680	I don't know.
1933680	1934680	Who's number one?
1934680	1935680	I think it might be Duncan Trussell.
1935680	1937680	I'll fucking kill that guy.
1937680	1940680	Fucking hippy piece of shit.
1940680	1941680	Fucking probably.
1941680	1943680	Yeah, he's probably probably.
1943680	1950680	They're probably counting astral people in the, in the, in the, in the listener's
1950680	1952680	numbers.
1952680	1957680	It's like Greg and Greg spirit are both listening.
1957680	1960680	Dan, in this lighting right now, right?
1960680	1962680	What were you standing right in this lighting?
1962680	1968680	You have become more good looking than Russell Crowe.
1968680	1972680	He, he looks like shit.
1972680	1977680	You have, you've crossed over into being better.
1977680	1978680	Russell Crowe.
1978680	1985680	Our guests tonight have a podcast called the dough boys on feral audio.
1985680	1987680	They, they review.
1987680	1988680	Excuse me.
1988680	1991680	It's the worst intro in the world.
1991680	1993680	You can't burp during an intro.
1993680	1998680	They, they review a franchise restaurants.
1998680	1999680	It's, it's salt of the earth.
1999680	2001680	There was my burp assault of the earth.
2001680	2006680	They, they, they review franchise restaurant chain restaurants, you know, like,
2006680	2009680	Jesus Christ.
2009680	2012680	We'll, we'll, we'll get to know every little detail about them.
2012680	2015680	It's a, they're, they're, they're UCB alum.
2015680	2018680	They're, they're, they're very much, they're, they're, they're related to our
2018680	2021680	family by a lot of mutual cousins and things.
2021680	2022680	We can talk about that too.
2022680	2023680	Oh, can we Dan?
2023680	2024680	Shut up.
2024680	2027680	You fucking millennial puke.
2027680	2028680	What did you come here for?
2028680	2031680	Norman Lear was coming back.
2031680	2032680	Norman Lear.
2032680	2034680	That was the most intense shit in the world.
2034680	2035680	I know.
2035680	2038680	And then, and then remember when Dustin uploaded the podcast and it said normal
2038680	2042680	Lear.
2042680	2047680	This guy, 93 years old, he's, he's worked in the business for a hundred of those
2047680	2050680	years.
2050680	2055680	His name is Norman Silver Lake hippie.
2055680	2063680	You get to get the, get the, get the incense out of your mouth.
2063680	2067680	The dough boys are here and we're going to get to know them now.
2067680	2085680	They are Nick Weiger and Mitch Mitchell, the dough boys.
2085680	2087680	That's a Mike Mitchell, right?
2087680	2088680	Well, you go, you go by Mitch.
2088680	2089680	I go by Mitch.
2089680	2090680	Yeah.
2090680	2091680	So that's fine.
2091680	2092680	We haven't established canonically what Mitch's name is.
2092680	2095680	He goes by Mike, he goes by Michael and he goes by Mitch.
2095680	2096680	I'm fine with all of that.
2096680	2100680	See, I was trying to save work because it said the information I got was it's
2100680	2101680	Mike Mitchell.
2101680	2106680	He goes by Mitch and I was like, why am I going to share the genealogy?
2106680	2108680	I introduced myself as Mitch.
2108680	2112680	I don't care about myself enough to even care what anyone calls me when they,
2112680	2114680	when people ask me, I'm just like, yeah, Mitch or Mike.
2114680	2115680	I don't care.
2115680	2116680	I don't care what they say.
2116680	2117680	It's fine with me.
2117680	2121680	So long as I don't like make anyone angry, which I think I'm doing right now
2121680	2123680	possibly.
2123680	2127680	No, you have to work harder than that to get on their good side.
2127680	2129680	They're like, I hate myself too, bro.
2129680	2131680	All right. Good, good, good.
2131680	2133680	We're on the, we're on the same side.
2133680	2135680	So your podcast is, people love it.
2135680	2138680	Spencer counts himself among the fans, I believe.
2138680	2139680	Yeah.
2139680	2140680	Thank you, Spencer.
2140680	2141680	It's not a big deal.
2141680	2142680	Thanks, Spencer.
2142680	2146680	It's not a good look to tell people you love their podcast.
2146680	2147680	It's not a good look.
2147680	2148680	It's not.
2148680	2149680	We appreciate it.
2149680	2150680	Yeah, we like it.
2150680	2151680	We're number five.
2151680	2152680	We didn't know we were number five.
2152680	2153680	That's pretty.
2153680	2154680	That's not bad, right?
2154680	2155680	I got that.
2155680	2156680	You know, it's Dustin.
2156680	2157680	He's a producer.
2157680	2158680	He thinks about these things.
2158680	2160680	He's just going to give a thumbs up or something.
2160680	2161680	Yeah.
2161680	2162680	All right.
2162680	2163680	There we go.
2163680	2165680	Why is it called dough boys?
2165680	2167680	Uh, good question.
2167680	2173680	Um, I mean, I would say that we are doughy men eating unhealthy food.
2173680	2176680	So he was, he was fat at one point.
2176680	2177680	Yeah.
2177680	2179680	And I remained fat.
2179680	2183680	Oh, and I've never not got fat, but he was a fat guy at one point.
2183680	2184680	He's thin.
2184680	2185680	You're a thin man now.
2185680	2189680	I'd say I'm towards the slender side, but there's still a layer of putting over everything.
2189680	2192680	Like I'm not like, I'm not like cut, you know, I'm in pretty good shape though.
2192680	2193680	Yeah.
2193680	2194680	I used to be a lot fatter.
2194680	2195680	Yeah.
2195680	2198680	Um, but no, it's, it's an, we live an unhealthy lifestyle.
2198680	2202680	We both kind of have the diets of guys who are bulking up for an Academy award winning
2202680	2203680	role.
2203680	2208680	And so, and, and so it's just like we're, as far as a comment on that dough boys felt
2208680	2209680	appropriate.
2209680	2211680	The other one that a runner up was sight of guys.
2211680	2212680	We almost went with that.
2212680	2214680	And I think we made the right call.
2214680	2217680	I went dead silent.
2217680	2219680	Are you both under 30?
2219680	2220680	I'm 35.
2220680	2221680	I'm 33.
2221680	2222680	Okay.
2222680	2226680	Under 30, like I couldn't gain a pound.
2226680	2230680	Then one day I was sitting at Rob's Shrabs with Dan.
2230680	2235680	We would get, uh, Benito's tacos every night and I was like, Oh fuck, I'm, I'm fat.
2235680	2237680	I gained a pound.
2237680	2242680	He put it under his pillow, his first pound.
2242680	2244680	He framed it.
2244680	2248680	He framed it like a car washes dollar.
2248680	2255680	Um, well, just curiously though, Nick, Nick is the skinny one, right?
2255680	2259680	Not the one that's named Mike and Mitch.
2259680	2260680	Mike is a skinny one.
2260680	2266680	And there's a part of me that thinks that this is all like a seven style, uh, plot by
2266680	2270680	you to make me fucking fatter and fatter as time goes on.
2270680	2276680	I don't want to derail as too much, but, uh, but, but I'm just, I am curious if you were
2276680	2279680	fat and you got thin, Nick, what was there a method you used?
2279680	2283680	Cause a lot of my listeners are always, always looking for a new technique.
2283680	2285680	It's, he told me his technique.
2285680	2286680	Yeah.
2286680	2288680	I mean, like I've been through, my weight is yo-yoed a lot through my life.
2288680	2292680	I was like a fat kid and then I got skinny late in the day, like in early adulthood.
2292680	2296680	When I was like 18, 19, I was like very thin and the best shape of my life.
2296680	2298680	Then I plumped up again throughout my twenties.
2298680	2299680	They're around 29.
2299680	2300680	I lost some weight again.
2300680	2305680	And the factor late in life was a diet like earlier in life, when I had that initial weight
2305680	2308680	loss, I just started swimming and I just burned off a shitload of calories.
2308680	2311680	I think like what I'm saying, just, just, just that much of activity and having that
2311680	2312680	young metabolism.
2312680	2317680	But as I was older, I found that I had to restrict sugar and restrict carbohydrate
2317680	2321680	intake and just have a very strict sort of low carb ish diet.
2321680	2322680	All right.
2322680	2323680	But you're not doing that anymore.
2323680	2328680	Do you guys actively, when you guys, I listened to a little bit of a, one of your most recent
2328680	2329680	podcasts.
2329680	2331680	I picked the one that had my friend David Phillips on it.
2331680	2332680	Oh yeah.
2332680	2333680	Phillips is great guy.
2333680	2337680	And, but I never got to the part where you actually started talking about the specific
2337680	2338680	restaurant.
2338680	2344680	Although at the top of the podcast episode, there's this very charming, uh, uh, post Carina
2344680	2345680	Longworth.
2345680	2348680	Uh, is that a reference that sticks now?
2348680	2353680	Uh, the, the, the, uh, very, very academic, just like, like dump of information about
2353680	2355680	the restaurant you're going to be talking about.
2355680	2356680	Yeah.
2356680	2357680	Is that every episode?
2357680	2358680	I have a little monologue.
2358680	2361680	I start each episode with, it's kind of just loosely plagiarized from Wikipedia.
2361680	2363680	Um, but it makes me sound and feel smart.
2363680	2366680	So I like to stay it and sort of gives a little background on the restaurant and then we fuck
2366680	2368680	around for like 45 minutes.
2368680	2369680	And then we finally get to the restaurant.
2369680	2372680	We talk about that for pretty much the balance of the episode.
2372680	2373680	Yeah.
2373680	2377480	You give a nice little autistic twist on it and, uh, people seem to enjoy it.
2377480	2381680	Are you just drawing on memories of eating at these places or do you, do you ever have
2381680	2382680	to study up?
2382680	2388000	Mitch and I go, uh, before each episode, the two of us go either together independently,
2388000	2391560	sometimes with our guests, um, to the restaurant in question.
2391560	2394000	So we always have a fresh perspective on whatever we're visiting.
2394000	2398440	And sometimes that involves a draw, a drive to Gardena to visit, uh, Long John Silver's.
2398440	2399440	That sucks.
2399440	2410200	Um, and then in March, we, I ate 18 cheeseburgers in March, um, please, I'll take it.
2410200	2412680	I have nothing else to, I love it.
2412680	2416480	You ate 18 burgers throughout the month of March or you ate them in one day?
2416480	2417480	No, God, no.
2417480	2419560	18 cheeseburgers throughout the month of March.
2419560	2422000	That was not for the podcast though.
2422000	2425640	That was for the podcast.
2425640	2430320	Uh, so it's, it's, it was your favorite burger in town, Mitch.
2430320	2435800	So, so this is, we were ranking them and, and it's a point of contention because, uh,
2435800	2438760	I like Wendy's, he likes In-N-Out Burger.
2438760	2443240	And then I voted in the final, I voted for, uh, Shake Shack was what I voted for.
2443240	2444240	Shake Shack.
2444240	2445240	I don't think I've ever been there.
2445240	2446240	It's good.
2446240	2447240	It's really good.
2447240	2451720	What is the, uh, cause I mean, it's important to note, you guys aren't snarky about the whole
2451720	2452720	thing.
2452720	2457280	You're not foodies that are bashing on these restaurants for being less than gourmet.
2457280	2461600	You're actually partaking in the, you know, you're opening the hood of, of a staple of
2461600	2464600	our lives, which is like these giant corporate chains.
2464600	2472120	And you're, you're approaching them as if, as if you were talking about real food.
2472120	2475120	Where does that, where does that, where did that passion come from?
2475120	2476720	Where did that passion come from?
2476720	2480960	Harmon, just go hang yourself.
2480960	2483000	Where did that passion come from?
2483000	2487800	You put it, no, you put a good twist on it because I feel like we just, I mean, we like
2487800	2490720	all these restaurants and we want an excuse to eat there every week.
2490720	2493480	I feel like, and that was a big part of it.
2493480	2499600	And then, uh, yeah, when you guys go to right here, I mean, turning this into something
2499600	2505960	about me, the, the, the, the, the big LA thing is, um, there's, there's a new restaurant
2505960	2507880	every day and there's another one closing.
2507880	2511680	And if you wanted to every day, you could just like, and there are people who want to
2511680	2514840	do this in particular, I feel like it's an age thing.
2514840	2520360	Like my younger friends are, have no problem going, let's go eat at this one place.
2520360	2522200	I heard great things about it.
2522200	2526920	And I always know that if you heard great things about it, that means I'm going to be
2526920	2534360	sitting in doll furniture, uh, elbow to elbow with strangers, um, uh, and, and, and eating,
2534360	2537760	you know, not to get all Tim Allen about it, but also the portions are going to be small
2537800	2544040	and the, and, and weird, like in some deliberate way, some off-handedly fucking deliberate
2544040	2545040	way.
2545040	2549080	And whereas then there's just like, holy shit, can I go to Taylor steakhouse?
2549080	2554640	I, I, every time I go to night and market song, you know, night plus market song, I'm
2554640	2558040	always afraid I'm going to fall through the chair every time I go there.
2558040	2561280	Like I'm truly embarrassed, like nervous and embarrassed, I'm going to fall through the
2561280	2562280	chair.
2562280	2567280	But yeah, I mean, we, we talked about that because we do like, I like all types of food,
2567480	2569320	but yeah, we like, we like fine dining too.
2569320	2575200	And we like like cool hip, uh, you know, individual location places, but there's something inclusive
2575200	2579360	and comforting about chains by design, you know, like it's a different experience going
2579360	2584560	to a Mimi's cafe or a Chili's and their whole, it's calculated at a corporate level to make
2584560	2586400	you feel included.
2586400	2587400	And I don't know.
2587400	2590280	I mean, we wanted to celebrate that atmosphere and not like make fun of it because it's something
2590280	2594000	that for a lot of people, that's the only, uh, depending on where you live in the country,
2594000	2596240	that's the only, those are the only restaurants you have access to.
2596240	2598160	Right. Well, that's interesting.
2598160	2600580	So in being connoisseurs of chains.
2600580	2603280	So what are the things that you have concluded?
2603280	2604280	What connects all of them?
2604280	2605600	You've done like 50 episodes of this.
2605600	2610240	So there must be, is there like overriding psychological principles at work in a successful
2610240	2611600	chain restaurant?
2611600	2613440	I'd say a hundred percent.
2613440	2618240	Like uh, well you, you, you're the smarter one of the two, so you go for it.
2618240	2622680	When you say make you feel included, I think is the phrase you use, make you feel included
2622680	2623680	or invited.
2623680	2624680	What did you say?
2624680	2628360	I'm not sure if that was the perfect word choice, but elaborate on that.
2628360	2633360	It's just like, uh, you know, there's, there's when anytime you're at a restaurant, you're
2633360	2636720	paying for the service, you're paying for the food, but you're also paying for the service.
2636720	2640500	You're paying for people to pretend like they're your servants for a little bit.
2640500	2644440	And like, I feel like the better chain restaurants, fundamentally that's what you're dealing with.
2644440	2647480	You know, you're paying for people to sort of dote on you and take care of your every
2647480	2652200	need and act like, uh, to pretend in this, in this situation, you're a higher status
2652200	2654600	of them, but in the real world you might not be, you know?
2654600	2660900	So I think the, the effective, uh, the effective chain restaurants kind of just have that experience.
2660900	2664680	They just presented it in a way that you would in, in, in, in a good individual location
2664680	2665680	restaurant.
2665680	2666680	They franchise wide.
2666680	2668480	They kind of have, they, they make you feel that way.
2668480	2671840	And one restaurant we reviewed very highly, um, this chain Hillstone.
2671840	2672840	It goes by many names.
2672840	2674600	Houston's you may know is most popularly.
2674600	2675600	Yeah.
2675600	2676600	Houston's is great.
2676600	2684000	Um, but I mean, that's a place where just the, the level of service, the level of service
2684000	2687040	is universally very high in addition to the food quality.
2687040	2695560	So I, yeah, I guess I find Chili's like, uh, reliable in an airport, where airports is
2695560	2704840	kind of a, it's a no man's land, uh, I've never, that's, that's an interesting, from
2704840	2712320	a class perspective, it's like, it's, you're talking about a middle-class thing, like,
2712320	2716680	and going out to dinner being not something you do every night, possibly doing it with
2716680	2718600	your family and loved ones.
2718600	2721840	And there is like, I guess that there's something interesting about that.
2721840	2726880	Like they create little worlds as if it's part dinner, part vacation.
2726880	2735440	Like you've, you've come to islands, you have a, uh, have a tropical doppily doopy doo,
2735440	2739400	you know, and they, they have like, they have like little sayings and they have little,
2739400	2741520	and they have outfits and they have a, the whole theme thing.
2741520	2744840	And I just realized that that's not, I don't know what I ever thought that was.
2744840	2746760	I hadn't problematized it yet.
2746760	2751120	I hadn't, I hadn't looked at it like, like, like, and I asked myself, I just felt like
2751120	2755320	that was just, I, but that's what they're trying to do is they're trying to, they're
2755320	2760880	competing over dollars that are harder earned than to, than to say like, they're like dollars
2760880	2766920	that are like, holy shit, I, I almost died, uh, like, like, like, like, like typing, uh,
2766920	2772320	for this dollar, my bones are sticking out of my fingertips and, um, and I, and I want
2772320	2773920	to make sure I get treated right.
2773920	2777440	And so they, you know, that's like the, the, the, the big giant parking lots of the big
2777440	2782360	blinking signs that say like, look, there's plenty of room here, there's a runway.
2782360	2783360	Yeah.
2783360	2787800	I feel like, and I, especially now there's, there's that thing of, there's, there's two,
2787800	2792520	there's two things I play to that I feel like that kind of, uh, we'll, we'll separate the
2792520	2796040	good from the bad and it's, it's the, the quality of being good across like all the
2796040	2797040	restaurants.
2797040	2802320	If you can like keep a standard of quality in, in Los Angeles and then somewhere in Wyoming,
2802320	2806760	like everywhere you go, it feels like kind of the same level of food and then that's
2806760	2810160	like, and then, and then the chains that have failed have been ones that are, that kind
2810160	2813000	of like, you go to a different place and it'll be good and then it will be bad.
2813000	2814120	Or they're just bad in general.
2814120	2815120	Or they're just bad in general.
2815120	2816120	I mean, those are the worst.
2816120	2817520	It was just places that tastes like shit.
2817520	2821800	We went to this place that I had fond memories of from my childhood, um, Carrows, which is
2821800	2829320	a West coast chain, Carrows, Carrows, and at one point they were pretty, it was pretty
2829320	2832640	big and it was well reviewed and it was well revered and it was a place that would be like
2832640	2833800	a treat.
2833800	2835480	And now it's kind of, it's dying.
2835480	2838560	It got bought off by a larger company and it went from, you know, I think it's, it's
2838560	2839560	peak.
2839560	2840560	It had 60 locations.
2840560	2841800	Now it's like 12 locations.
2841800	2845320	We went to one in South Pasadena, which was like one of the only ones in the greater LA
2845320	2846320	area.
2846320	2848040	And it was just, it was a real sad, sad scene.
2848040	2850480	We asked the way we were like, what do you like to eat at this place?
2850480	2851920	And she was like, nothing.
2851920	2852920	She said that.
2852920	2855120	She just said nothing at all.
2855120	2861000	And we were like, oh, um, Carrows has rice pudding, by the way.
2861000	2862000	Nobody has rice pudding.
2862000	2863000	Yeah.
2863000	2864440	You can get a rice pudding at Carrows.
2864440	2868480	Well, I think that's, I think that's the thing of like the entire clientele, except for us
2868480	2873480	was, uh, was older adults, was seniors who I think it was like, oh, this is my comforting
2873480	2875040	place that I've gotten used to.
2875040	2879520	But I think, you know, do you guys ever go to Sambo's or are you too young?
2879520	2880520	Sambo's?
2880520	2881520	Yeah.
2881520	2882520	No.
2882520	2883520	I mean, probably.
2883520	2887880	I was about to say that there's a place called Sambo's.
2887880	2890440	I think there might be still one that exists.
2890440	2891440	Santa Barbara.
2891440	2892440	Oh my God.
2892440	2894520	There's still this and they maintain.
2894520	2896600	That's why it's called Sambo's.
2896600	2899300	It's short for Santa Barbara.
2899300	2903040	We know better from the logo.
2903040	2905800	The logo isn't a sunset behind a ship.
2905800	2908480	Uh, the, uh, did you, what about Barnaby's?
2908600	2910600	You guys ever hear Barnaby's?
2910600	2911600	No.
2911600	2912600	Have you heard of Barnaby's?
2912600	2913600	Where is Barnaby's?
2913600	2917080	Barnaby's was, I mean, it was a place, so when I was a kid, I thought there was only
2917080	2918080	one Barnaby's.
2918080	2919080	That's the other thing.
2919080	2922160	When you're a kid, you grew up, whatever, but, but, but that's the thing.
2922160	2928600	When you're a kid, you just want to kill myself, uh, I just want to, I want to, I want to
2928600	2935280	kill myself just so I can go to hell and have everyone there tell me to kill myself, man.
2935280	2938720	We would love to have you on the podcast because we talk, we talk about fast food,
2938720	2941760	but like 70% of it is talking about killing ourselves.
2941760	2949080	Now, if there isn't a death wish behind a podcast dedicated to reviewing chain restaurant
2949080	2952680	food, then I guess you'd have to go to the Philip Morris happy hour.
2952680	2953680	I don't know.
2953680	2957040	Uh, we, we, we talk about it on podcasts and then we get done with the podcast and we text
2957040	2961440	each other about how we want to kill ourselves, like never stops happening.
2961440	2966440	By the way, for you 16 year olds listening, that is a sport among those of us over 30
2966440	2968280	we're professionals.
2968280	2969280	Don't do it.
2969280	2972480	If you, if you, if you have conflicted feelings, talk to somebody that's not the same thing.
2972480	2974840	It's not the same thing that you're feeling.
2974840	2976480	Hang in there and talk to somebody.
2976480	2977480	All right.
2977480	2980720	Uh, I want, I want nothing on my hands, man.
2980720	2984120	Uh, I want to, I want to leave only footprints on this world.
2984120	2991000	And I already fucked up with that Chevy voicemail and I was like, last thing I need is like,
2991000	2999960	you know, this tumbler note, um, um, the, uh, bar, Barnaby's was a, but also I care if
2999960	3004400	you're listening, uh, the Barnaby's was like this, I had this like stained glass.
3004400	3008160	It was an Italian restaurant kind of Italian restaurant.
3008160	3013560	It was, it was a pizza place and, and, and it was everything was, everything was like
3013560	3019360	varnished wood and darkness and, and like stained glass chandeliers and stained glass
3019360	3021480	windows that didn't let any light in.
3021480	3024600	If you were eating there during the day and then, and then there was like a little window
3024600	3028400	to the kitchen, like some of those places have where you could watch the guys make the
3028400	3029400	pizza.
3029400	3031360	Um, and, uh, I don't know.
3031360	3034560	I don't know why I'm bringing it up because, well, because I never knew it was a chain.
3034560	3039000	I just thought it was this place that it was in Milwaukee and my family would go there.
3039000	3040640	It was our big, that was our place.
3040640	3047280	That was, that meant that like, like beyond let's go to McDonald's because it's a fuck
3047280	3048320	it kind of night.
3048880	3051680	This was like, it's, it's special.
3051680	3054640	It's like a fuck it kind of night and, and we're in a good mood.
3055520	3062640	Um, and, and, and, and, and like, uh, it closed, it got taken over by this place called Tom
3062640	3067680	Foolery's, um, which was, it was on the heels of Chuck E. Cheese.
3067880	3070920	Um, it was Chuck E. Cheese for adults, Tom Foolery.
3071120	3074920	Uh, the logo was in, is, it was in Miami vice style blue neon.
3075920	3080760	And you would go into, the idea was that the parents could hang out in this swank eighties
3080760	3082640	swingery kind of dining environment.
3083000	3087640	And, and there was a stack of free tokens for the arcade in the corner, which was like
3087640	3088280	this grotto.
3088280	3090240	You would just stuff your kids for the evening.
3090840	3094400	And then it was like, so it was like, it was like pursuing the strange dichotomy.
3094400	3096160	It was like, like, like, Hey, it's the eighties.
3096200	3097800	Maybe your family's a liability.
3100120	3102760	Like, like, and Pac-Man's here to solve that problem.
3103560	3106960	Like, like, like we've got the shit figured out Reaganomics, man.
3107400	3112520	Uh, we, we, we, and then, and that, but then my friend Dino took me to a Barnaby's in
3112520	3114520	Chicago and it was identical.
3114880	3116960	I had so many fucking flashbacks.
3116960	3118760	I was like, wait, can I go to the bathroom?
3119120	3120120	The answer is yes.
3120320	3126840	Uh, but like the entire floor plan of the entire place was identical, which is another
3126840	3130640	crazy thing about a chain restaurant is like, you could have, you could have a memory of
3130640	3132240	your favorite eighth birthday.
3132360	3132680	Yeah.
3132680	3136360	And then you could, if they're, if that, if that virus of that restaurant survives in
3136360	3140600	some pocket, even if you have to, you have to go find one somewhere, you could like have
3140600	3141640	all those flashbacks.
3141680	3144480	We, we just, we just recently, well, he's got something going on.
3144680	3146520	Uh, we recently went to Chuck E.
3146520	3148560	Cheese as speaking of Tom Thullerys.
3148800	3151120	My lovely ex wave, Eric McGathey's episode, right?
3151120	3151600	That's correct.
3151600	3151840	Yeah.
3151840	3158320	And, and, uh, and, uh, I'd never felt like, uh, like a bigger pervert in my entire life.
3159400	3160640	Did you actually go to a Chuck E.
3160640	3161440	Cheese with Aaron?
3161640	3163800	Uh, I went, uh, are you fucking her?
3163920	3164640	No, no.
3168920	3169440	Shit.
3170440	3173960	Cause like I'm dating, but the best time in town ever.
3175640	3176480	No, sir.
3177480	3180080	We find out one of the doughboys is fucking your ex wife.
3184280	3185720	And that that's how you do it.
3186360	3192600	I mean, if you're going to fuck someone ex wife, take them to Chuck E. Cheese.
3193200	3193560	I'm sorry.
3193560	3195720	I'm derailing you to a certain extent.
3196480	3197920	Are, are there still Chuck E.
3197920	3199080	Cheese's there?
3199080	3200920	There is, there's a lot of them actually.
3200920	3202240	There was way more than I thought there was.
3202280	3202480	Yeah.
3202480	3203760	It was like 250.
3203800	3205520	There's like a good number nationwide.
3205560	3206880	They merged with showbiz.
3206920	3208000	Was it showbiz or showtime?
3208000	3209080	Pizza pizza pizza.
3209080	3209240	Yeah.
3209240	3211800	They merged with showbiz pizza and then converted all their locations.
3211800	3215080	There's, there's still a lot, you know, on the, on the ski ball there, when, when
3215160	3219840	the tickets come out, if you slightly pull, they just keep fucking coming.
3219960	3220360	Oh yeah.
3221080	3221640	Nice hack.
3223040	3225120	Here's, here's another life hack.
3225400	3231160	Uh, if you're 11 years old in the eighties, uh, uh, and you don't get
3231160	3235640	invited to a Chuck E. Cheese birthday party, you fucking like, you're, you're
3235640	3238600	just, you're off the grid unpopular.
3238680	3240960	You, you, you become a show creator later on in life.
3240960	3245120	I, uh, I never, it was like, oh, Steve's having a Chuck E. Cheese birthday.
3245120	3248320	But I was like, there were no, there was no discretion because those parties were
3248320	3251080	just like, just tell basically everybody to come.
3251320	3253600	It's not like people were buying their pizza.
3253600	3256200	It was like, it was like a Midwestern thing was like, just show up.
3256200	3258000	Just didn't want me there.
3258040	3260200	Who did want me in a public place.
3261360	3264360	Dan, who, who did not invite you to Chuck E. Cheese?
3264400	3267920	I said, Steve, Steve, Steve, who?
3268080	3270000	I'm not going to name his last name.
3270640	3271440	Ramstack.
3273160	3273600	No.
3273600	3276000	I mean, the people who wronged me have suffered.
3276000	3276760	Believe me.
3280160	3282000	Wait, what did you do?
3282440	3283560	I didn't do shit.
3283640	3284840	I'm God's hammer.
3284920	3285520	And word.
3289240	3290720	Karma just happens.
3293040	3299320	So sometimes you have the pleasure of filling God hammering people using you
3299320	3302120	as the hammer, that's what Facebook is about, right?
3302120	3306520	You feel that nature actually has like tortured them or they actually got their
3306520	3307200	comeuppance?
3307880	3309240	Uh, I don't know.
3309240	3313000	Do you think their goal was to like, uh, just keep loving football?
3313000	3316920	And was that supposed to make them like really happy or?
3317040	3319720	I mean, there's something terrible happened to that person.
3320920	3324720	There's no burnt houses or anything on their Facebook profiles, but I check in
3324720	3326040	and I go like, yeah.
3326960	3327280	Yeah.
3329880	3332400	Told you, told you baseball was dumb.
3336240	3341920	I don't post that on their page, but I say it to myself and I masturbate, cry and
3341920	3346400	fall asleep and I don't come a lot.
3347120	3350160	I come desperate, sad little droplets.
3351720	3355800	Well, after hearing this, uh, just to be clear, no, I don't have a lot of
3355800	3357600	clear Nick and I don't fuck at all.
3359520	3360480	We don't fuck anything.
3360520	3363960	Um, but, uh, we went, we went to, I went to Chuck E.
3363960	3370960	Cheese by myself and then, uh, a friend, uh, for those of you who aren't video
3370960	3374800	subscribers, uh, the crowd gasped.
3376160	3380120	Mitch, Mitch isn't, Mitch isn't a guy you hope as a parent to see at a Chuck E.
3380120	3382160	Cheese by himself.
3382960	3390600	You'd rather see him there with a kid and a baby Bjorn friend, a friend, a grown
3390600	3391960	adult friend to join me.
3391960	3396320	A man, uh, and, uh, it's getting worse.
3396440	3399120	If he, if he looked like Stanley Tucci, it just makes it worse.
3400240	3401920	Like you have like an accomplice.
3404000	3405160	It was, uh, it was not good.
3405160	3410400	We sat by the stage, uh, and, uh, he wanted, he was like in intent on playing
3410400	3413080	skeeball afterwards and I was like, please, I was sweating.
3413080	3416440	I was like, we need to get out of here as fast as possible.
3416480	3417840	But we played a little skeeball.
3418200	3422080	Uh, it's one, it's one of those virus restaurants that you were talking
3422080	3425400	about, like a virus chain where it's, it's, you're like, Oh, I remember some
3425400	3427360	of this, but it's not, nothing is right here.
3427360	3429000	Like nothing feels right about it.
3429000	3430760	I have the strangest, most specific memory.
3430760	3433260	I've went to, I went to showbiz before it was Chuck E.
3433260	3434880	Cheese one time.
3435200	3438340	And I think it was because my parents get so used to me coming home kind of like
3438380	3441580	sad and then dragging it out of me that Steve didn't invite me.
3441580	3443220	It was fucking gala again.
3443620	3449580	Um, so at one point they actually took me to showbiz, just my parents and me.
3450020	3454500	And, uh, and we sat in the back room and there was a, there was a Billy Bob, the
3454500	3456700	bear, and he sang songs and stuff.
3456700	3460140	I think I've talked about this on the podcast before, because I remember it
3460140	3462300	straight, I was probably 12 years old, 11.
3462700	3466260	Uh, and they, they did this like letters section.
3466260	3470500	They would sing songs, animatronic band, and then they did a letter like, oh,
3470500	3471660	here's, here's letters.
3471900	3476020	And then one of the letters they read was from a kid who said, Billy Bob, how come
3476020	3481500	when you're on stage, you have bare feet, uh, uh, with no shoes on.
3481500	3486500	And when you're wandering around the arcade, you have sneakers on, uh, why
3486500	3487580	would they include that?
3487580	3492300	Like talk about like a weird shame, like fraud complex, like, and just like, like,
3492300	3495740	like a telltale heart, like, like, like, they're like, they, we have to address
3495740	3502860	this. Um, and, and, and, and, and Billy Bob said, said, animatronic robot bear
3502860	3508900	answered the question that the kid posed and said, well, the thing is when I'm up
3508900	3511180	here on stage, I don't want to fall off the stage.
3511220	3516820	So my bear toe claws, uh, helped me keep balance up here, but, but when I'm walking
3516820	3520860	around there, while you're eating your food, no one wants to see my toenails out
3520860	3524740	there. Um, meanwhile, you're eating pizza and listening to him talking about his
3525580	3526980	toenails and it's gross.
3527020	3529900	So mission not accomplished.
3529900	3532420	And, and, and, and then, and then, and then they moved on.
3532420	3537460	That's my memory of showbiz pizza place was, was just weird, like over piping.
3537460	3540700	Like don't, if, if it's, if sometimes if it's broke, don't fix it.
3541380	3544500	I feel like, uh, you can't hear any of that stuff anymore.
3544500	3549860	Cause it's just like the whirring of like a 20 year old robots is all you can hear
3549860	3554660	now. It's just like the stirring of the robots and the flapping of their eyelids
3554660	3556340	and stuff. It's very off putting.
3556820	3557620	There must be a thing.
3557620	3563780	So it must be at this point, there, there must be a heavy, like, like the pie chart
3563780	3570020	of their, um, customer base, a lot, a big slice of it must be nostalgic adults
3570020	3573820	coming in to relive a childhood memory who don't have kids with them.
3573900	3579180	Based on my, uh, me and Mitch's, uh, anecdotal experience, I would say that's
3579180	3582500	a very small slice. It feels like they're mostly families.
3582500	3587940	And if you're adults alone without kids, you're drawing eyeballs for being very,
3587940	3589260	very, yeah, I don't know.
3589260	3592940	I don't know how much of the nostalgia crowd it's attracting, uh, among people who
3592940	3595780	don't have kids, maybe people who take their kids are like, Oh, this is a place I
3595780	3596420	used to go to.
3596420	3601220	It's like, you need to, so, so if you are, uh, over 30 and you do want to take a
3601220	3605980	nostalgic trip back to an animatronic themed pizza place, take a kid.
3610100	3614860	Well, maybe one, you know, whatever, just find a kid and have him with you so that
3614860	3616860	the other parents can be comfortable.
3617540	3619180	We were, we were afraid we were going to get stopped.
3619180	3620540	But leave with a different kid.
3621940	3624700	Well, they have, they have controls in place for that.
3624700	3625060	They have controls. Yeah.
3625060	3626900	They have checks and they have their checks and balances.
3626900	3629060	Yeah. The ball pit man tells no tales.
3631220	3633460	The ball pit tells no tales.
3633700	3635780	It's like the pig pen in dead wood.
3635780	3643700	Take him to the ball pit.
3645060	3648340	When you get in there, there's like an airlock system and you have to like wait
3648340	3651940	in a, in a cattle crate and they come over and give you wristbands that are
3651940	3655820	color coordinated so that they know that you're leaving with the correct children.
3655820	3658140	Oh God, it's really, really crazy.
3658140	3658580	Wow.
3658780	3661420	I mean that represents some actual crimes.
3661980	3664860	Like they used to have a stamp.
3664940	3666620	They used to have this hand stamp.
3666620	3668500	It was like ultra violet, you know?
3668500	3672580	And so there'd be a letter on it, but then I think they realized you could
3672580	3678780	just like buy those stamps and that's why they do wristbands.
3679100	3679620	I don't know.
3679740	3680940	This is a rabbit hole.
3680940	3684780	It's making it so hard for me to go and just steal children from Chuck E.
3684780	3685300	Cheese.
3686220	3689060	I just, I, I, I showed that we have to book on this guy.
3689060	3690340	He's like, Steve Levy's not here.
3690340	3691780	So this will fall on deaf ears.
3691820	3695980	But I want to book on the podcast because I don't want to do any research.
3696300	3703060	Uh, I want to know like, is the actual, like what the hell is, is, is it, what it,
3703260	3709500	uh, what, what is, is there more terrible things happening to children per
3709500	3713860	capita or, or, or, or is this like a weird guest?
3713940	3716660	What guest is going to solve that problem for you?
3717140	3724620	As a social worker, Janet Jackson, a census taker.
3724620	3725540	I don't fucking know.
3726540	3727100	Yeah, yeah.
3727100	3729380	I can't really go back to the same house and then they're gone.
3729580	3730020	I know.
3730020	3730980	I don't, I don't know.
3730980	3734140	Actually, I'm just somebody who could actually just say like, no, well, here's
3734140	3737140	the thing, because I know there's a variety of variables for, for instance,
3737140	3739260	the population keeps exploding.
3739420	3743220	So even if you were to, so sometimes flat numbers can be misleading.
3743220	3746100	I'm just, I'm just like Duncan was on this podcast.
3746100	3749700	And I'm like, really, he really liked what he was like saying, Oh, nevermind.
3749700	3751620	I'm not going to quote him again, because it was so funny, but it
3751620	3752700	makes him sound like a villain too.
3752900	3756020	I just like, like, it's we're, we're, we've become obsessed.
3756020	3759620	Obviously our national psyche is like doting on this like idea.
3759660	3764580	We can't have a conversation that involves children without immediately.
3764580	3769340	Like it's, it's, it's like a syndrome of like, both comedians have learned it
3769380	3773820	and like actual concern and it's all feeding into itself.
3773820	3778100	It's like, this is like guy's pocket of like, Oh my God, children are just like
3778100	3783420	this, like, like, like candy apple, just like rolling around and like, they're
3783420	3787780	just, they have targets on every side of their body and like the world is made of
3787780	3790900	arrows and I, I'm not interested in them.
3790940	3792380	Uh, I think they're gross.
3793580	3794540	I think they're annoying.
3794540	3796500	I think they're, they don't know overkill.
3796860	3800500	You ever try to explain to a kid that comedy comes in fucking threes, not nineties.
3800500	3803980	Yeah, get it.
3803980	3806980	It's an airplane fucking moron.
3807020	3808100	The stuff they're into.
3808260	3808460	Yeah.
3808460	3808980	You know what?
3808980	3810180	Some of them are going to get taken.
3810220	3812060	Uh, no one will be agree with this side.
3812060	3817220	Um, some of them are going to get taken sometimes, but, uh, room has showed
3817220	3818980	us that they get back unharmed.
3820260	3820500	I did.
3820500	3820660	Yeah.
3820660	3822100	I'm just, I find their way back.
3823300	3823900	I'm just curious.
3823900	3826380	Like, I was like, yeah, if there's something at work in the national psyche,
3826380	3827860	like there's, there's some shift that happened.
3827860	3831340	Like we, we changed our perception of drugs several times.
3831340	3833140	Like we've made, we made decisions.
3833140	3836020	You can trace them, you know, depending on your ideology.
3836020	3838420	Maybe it's that you can't fuck kids anymore.
3838620	3843140	You know, if it's impossible, I feel like through most of human history,
3843140	3845740	people have just been fucking kids left and right.
3845740	3846140	Right.
3846500	3851300	Like the child, you know, like, you know, you'd get married at like 11 or 12 and
3851300	3853540	then Greeks would fuck little boys.
3853860	3857740	It's actual, it's actual absence of the legal recourse to doing it.
3857740	3858020	Yeah.
3858620	3864100	I will say this, uh, at my, uh, confirmation, uh, Cardinal law was at my
3864100	3868460	confirmation, he gave mass Cardinal law, Cardinal law, like his name was
3868460	3870420	Cardinal law, Cardinal law.
3870540	3872980	And he's, he's, was he with corporal punishment?
3876500	3878100	You don't know about Cardinal law.
3878660	3880100	Have you seen, have you seen spotlight?
3880100	3880420	Yeah.
3880740	3882460	Cardinal law is the Hulk Hogan of.
3883860	3884620	Of spotlight.
3886100	3888980	He's a law for real.
3888980	3889580	That's amazing.
3889740	3890140	Go on.
3890180	3894620	He's, he, yeah, no, the villain of spotlight was, uh, gave the mass at my
3894620	3898780	confirmation and he, uh, he, he asked a question at which I guess my
3898780	3902140	Godfather said it was a very easy question and he pointed to me and I
3902140	3903900	didn't know the answer to the whole church left.
3903900	3907780	So, uh, so I feel like I got him in some sort of way, you know?
3907780	3915780	Uh, yeah, no, Cardinal, Cardinal law was, uh, was he, I mean, he covered it all up.
3915780	3918940	I feel like that's where it all went wrong with the children thing.
3918940	3922020	Cause I, when I, when I was in elementary school, I'd walk home from
3922020	3923700	school in elementary school.
3923700	3927220	Like, I feel like third grade, I'd be walking home from school.
3927260	3931620	And it seems like the shit that's what the, the, the, the things that I would
3931620	3937140	do when I was a kid, the territory I occupied, the amount of fencing around
3937140	3943540	it, both figuratively and literally like the amount of hours I was allowed to log
3943580	3949220	unsupervised in the expanse of territory, et cetera, like compared to what I, and
3949220	3954420	I've done it like not, like if I had a kid right now, eight years old, just based
3954420	3959140	on nothing more than just cultural zeitgeist, the disparity between where,
3959140	3964380	what I would let that kid do versus what I did when I was a kid is so vast.
3964500	3969900	It makes me ask the question, is also the environment actually is the disparity
3969900	3970900	actually there?
3970940	3971340	Yeah.
3971620	3977180	I would guess it's actually, I, I'm, I'm guessing this is nothing, no, but I'm
3977180	3982340	guessing that it's both gotten less dangerous for kids, but we've gotten
3982340	3983580	more awareness of it.
3983660	3987580	The, and yeah, all local news is national news now.
3987580	3991860	So every horrific, uh, you know, horrific crime that occurs or horrific accident
3991860	3995740	that, that happens with a, with a kid in a car seat you hear about, and it just
3995740	3996420	feeds that national.
3996420	3996460	Yeah.
3996460	4000100	Our grim fascination with, with, you know, not because we're bad people, but
4000100	4002020	because we're good people probably at heart.
4002020	4005220	Like we want to, you know, it's like the things that are going to pop and sizzle
4005260	4009860	off of a big frying pan full of grease called the internet are stories about
4009940	4013060	innocence, you know, getting, getting, getting hurt.
4013060	4016860	You know, I read a, I read a fucking long ass piece.
4016860	4019780	I don't know why I do this to myself, but I read really long, like true crime
4019780	4024660	pieces and I read a long piece of just about kids who were trapped in hot cars.
4024900	4029260	And I, there was like, there's this, this one part that stick that stuck with me.
4029620	4031100	It may, it'll probably stick with you now.
4031100	4031780	So I apologize.
4031780	4036340	But, um, there was a, they had asked a detective what was the worst thing they'd
4036340	4038740	ever seen involving one of these cases.
4039300	4039860	I've heard this.
4039860	4040780	Should I not share this?
4040780	4041140	Should I not?
4041140	4041820	I won't share it.
4041820	4046460	We're all, we're all, no, it's, it's part of our media watchdog segment.
4046460	4047540	We're all good people.
4047540	4050740	Everybody buckle your holy shit belts.
4051980	4056340	There, what was the worst thing you ever saw investigating one of these, uh, these
4056340	4056860	cases?
4056860	4060300	And I remember it said the detective took a pause to gather themselves.
4060620	4061980	You don't have to include that part.
4061980	4062180	Yeah.
4065420	4068900	There was a little girl, uh, who was two, who was trapped in a car.
4068940	4070100	It was a hundred degrees.
4070140	4074380	And when they found her, she was dead and she had torn all her hair out of her head.
4074380	4078700	Well, that's been a show guys.
4078700	4079940	Thanks for, thanks for coming.
4082340	4084660	Holy smoke, just a nightmare.
4084660	4085180	Just a night.
4085180	4093460	There was a, uh, in the, uh, Oh God, I think New Yorker magazine, uh, LAPD
4093460	4097820	homicide detective was asked, uh, they, they found, uh, like a couple of dead
4097820	4100060	bodies up in Angeles national forest.
4101060	4107300	And like they had been there for, you know, many years and a reporter asked
4107300	4110820	the detective, how many people do you think are buried out here?
4110860	4116220	And he said, if I asked everybody buried in national, like Angeles national forest
4116220	4118620	to stand up, it would look like Venice beach.
4119900	4123060	It's like, like that's where you, that's where you go to bury people.
4123380	4126860	So when you, when you're driving by on the two freeway and you say, they'd
4126860	4128180	all be silver robots.
4131060	4133020	They all have roller skates.
4134700	4137020	They all have boop boomboxes on the shoulders.
4139820	4141540	The amount of caricature art.
4147460	4151340	We are surrounded by a, by a forest full of murdered people.
4151540	4154980	Like, well, according to that cop, I mean, I, and I have no reason to doubt
4154980	4158220	him, but also Mark Furman as a example, I don't know.
4158220	4159460	He had information too.
4159460	4164220	I like, like, like, like cops are, you know, they're not, they don't graduate
4164220	4167100	from cop college to become cops.
4167100	4170900	They, they, some of them are, some of them know exactly what they're talking
4170900	4173540	about and some of them are like, I wish I was Mickey Spillane.
4174580	4177540	He was a hard boiled, like kind of writer.
4177580	4180620	Also, another, another one of Miller lights, all stars.
4181260	4185180	Another LAPD cop said that there's probably more dead bodies between us
4185180	4188820	and Catalina right now, because if you want to really kill somebody, have a boat.
4190180	4190700	Yeah, man.
4191260	4192380	Dave, don't yup that.
4192460	4192820	That's it.
4194140	4195380	That was a wrong time to yup.
4197020	4198900	Uh, that's how you do it.
4199500	4199860	All right.
4200060	4202740	I, uh, but your podcast is about food.
4205020	4209940	We should, we should all, let's all kill someone tonight and find out who wins.
4210980	4212580	By the way, I thought, where's my clock?
4212580	4213620	I'm flying blind here.
4213660	4214340	Yeah.
4216100	4216700	Oh my God.
4216700	4217540	The cops in Quincy.
4218420	4221180	It's not until you see, God, damn it.
4228060	4229340	We finally forgot.
4238700	4243620	It turns out all you have to do is turn a clock off and we can forget.
4244620	4250620	Uh, nine 13, what a bummer of the thoughts swirling in my head are I'm going to, I'm
4250620	4252580	going to, you know, there's a good chance.
4252580	4260100	What I'm about to do will ruin an episode as you know, zip, but let's just, I'm going
4260100	4265620	to wing it, uh, because of the, uh, we, we, we're, we're overrepresented on one side.
4265660	4272100	I'll ask for a female volunteer or, or, or someone, someone who, uh, uh, compartmentalizes
4272100	4282900	as such, uh, the, uh, uh, and, uh, what I, anybody who has, uh, a relationship, positive,
4282900	4288020	negative, anything noteworthy that they're willing to share their relationship about
4288020	4288540	their mother.
4289220	4290340	Uh, all right.
4290340	4292060	I'm going to hand go up pretty quickly here.
4293260	4293860	Come join us.
4303100	4307580	Hello, what's your name?
4308020	4308580	Lauren.
4308660	4309140	Lauren.
4309180	4309620	Yes.
4309620	4310420	I've met you before.
4310900	4313580	Well, nice to meet you again.
4313620	4313940	Yes.
4315300	4316940	Uh, Lauren, uh, yeah.
4316980	4319020	So, uh, did you, did you have a good mother's day?
4320060	4321580	No, no, I did not.
4322260	4324220	Uh, not, not, is it okay.
4324260	4328020	Well, uh, I'll walk down this path of, uh, okay.
4328020	4330380	So is it because you don't get along with your mom?
4331260	4335220	Yes, never really have actually.
4335940	4337620	So it's never been a good mother's day.
4337620	4344140	She's always found a way out of it by either getting mad at us, my brother and I,
4344220	4346860	uh, or canceling mother's day.
4346860	4351420	Like today I was going to plan to take her to Monterey because that's
4351420	4352820	where her mother is scattered.
4353220	4357620	And she's always, she was never there when her mother got scattered.
4357620	4359460	So I wanted to take her there to be with her mom.
4360460	4366860	And maybe a couple of weeks ago, she got mad at my brother and I and
4366900	4371820	canceled mother's day, basically by sending us a text message saying, I want
4371820	4374820	nothing, don't do anything for me.
4374900	4378700	This is like a refreshingly, not to call your problems refreshing,
4378700	4381140	but so effervescent, that's delicious.
4381420	4386300	Uh, but I typically somebody, I was like, like, I'm like, you're, you're,
4386300	4392780	so you're somebody that's like, like your, your mom ruins mother's day by
4392780	4394100	saying, I don't want anything.
4394220	4396540	Like, it's like, like this is a generational thing.
4396540	4398300	Maybe, or no, not to dismiss it.
4398300	4398940	It's very personal.
4398980	4399300	Okay.
4399540	4401380	Uh, I just think it's neat.
4401380	4404980	It's neat because with my mom and the problem is like, oh shit, what am I
4404980	4406060	supposed to, I don't know.
4406300	4410300	Um, and with your mom, you're saying like, why am I commenting on it?
4410300	4410940	How am I helping?
4411100	4415660	Um, uh, let's, let's get, let's get to the, to the, to the root of this.
4415700	4418340	Uh, so your, your mom is how old?
4418700	4419700	She's 51.
4420100	4421220	So you're a youngster.
4422220	4423380	Did she have you very young?
4423620	4427980	Uh, I don't remember, or I don't know.
4428300	4429620	I mean, I'm 25.
4429620	4431380	So 25 years ago.
4431540	4432020	Okay.
4432380	4433220	Um, yeah.
4433220	4436140	So, well, so you're at the age where your mom had you is what it sounds like.
4436140	4438980	I'm no mathematician, but does she live in town or is she out of state?
4439020	4439940	She just moved.
4439940	4440860	We, I just moved out.
4441260	4441580	Yeah.
4441580	4444580	She just, so you're trying to reach out to her and say, let's hang out.
4444580	4445300	Let's go.
4445780	4447180	Let's go be in Monterey.
4450700	4452100	That's that's Monterey, Mike.
4456220	4459820	You reached out to your mom and she was like, she, she, she didn't want any part
4459820	4460100	of that.
4460140	4463620	I didn't even get to tell her that that's what I was going to do for her.
4464340	4467500	She, do you think if, if you told her that she'd be open to that or no?
4468260	4471540	Well, because she said a couple of weeks ago, could you tell her, do you
4471540	4474540	comfortable talking about that event that what, what was the conflict that
4474540	4477580	resulted in your mom canceling mother's day and weeks in advance?
4477620	4482220	To be honest, I always, uh, forget why it's kind of weird.
4482220	4484020	It's like an ongoing thing I could do.
4484020	4485060	I could breathe wrong.
4485060	4487140	I could come home at a wrong time.
4487140	4492340	I could, uh, do one little thing wrong and it's just a constant cycle.
4492340	4493580	It's always been like that.
4493820	4494580	You say come home.
4494580	4495260	Do you live with her?
4495300	4496220	I used to live with her.
4496220	4496660	Yeah.
4496820	4498540	Um, what, what about other holidays?
4498540	4501260	Is there also Christmas is canceled.
4501300	4503100	Mother's day is canceled.
4503140	4504820	Wait, from just from today.
4506460	4507500	Just from today.
4507500	4508020	Yeah.
4508260	4510860	Uh, no, it's, it's a constant thing.
4510860	4512140	It's never happy.
4512380	4516700	It's always, I have been finding ways to spend holidays with other families.
4516700	4518860	Was that always the case throughout your childhood?
4518900	4519620	Yes.
4520100	4521460	What do you think that's about for her?
4521580	4527980	Um, I know she says she likes to say that she's not appreciated and I, my brother
4527980	4532340	and I have done our best, but we come from divorce parents where it wasn't
4532340	4537820	pretty and it was a weird custody agreement and we got tossed back and
4537820	4543020	forth between our parents and it was never kind of, it was a very unstable
4543020	4543820	environment.
4544220	4549420	So that plus I also know things were triggered by like her upbringing.
4549420	4554580	She wasn't very friendly with her mother and it's a constant looks like it's
4554580	4555980	been a cycle for years.
4556020	4557020	So it sounds like, yeah.
4557020	4564380	I mean, like with like trauma gets handed down, she, she's not to speculate in either
4564380	4569700	direction, like judging her or, or, or forgiving her, but just like from what I'm
4569700	4575140	learning in therapy, like one might speculate that these holidays represent
4575700	4579580	like the opportunity for crisis.
4579660	4584780	Um, and that she's ironically trying to shut them down and thinking that that's
4584780	4585620	going to solve the problem.
4585620	4589100	But of course she's creating new, she's just doing it again.
4589140	4589300	Yeah.
4589300	4591300	That's exactly what I hear in therapy as well.
4592700	4594460	That she's like, she's like shutting off.
4594460	4596900	She's like, oh, uh, yeah, I don't want to have a heart attack.
4596900	4598300	So I'll shut off all blood to my heart.
4598300	4601700	You know, like that way I'll be perfectly immortal forever.
4601980	4606860	Um, and, and so like you're, you're able to know that, but like, like, like it's
4607180	4611340	like, like, how do you so, and yet you're not going to do that when you have kids.
4611340	4612180	Are you going to have kids?
4612300	4614100	I'm going to have kids one day, maybe.
4614140	4614620	I don't know.
4614900	4616180	You're going to have them tonight.
4618300	4619860	Let's spin the wheel.
4621260	4622940	That's the harm in town, guaranteed.
4625220	4625940	Problematic.
4626700	4628940	Everybody gets impregnated tonight.
4629780	4632580	I feel, I feel like that is like a common mom threat though.
4632740	4633020	Right?
4633020	4637420	Like that, like, like my mom gets frustrated around the holidays and then
4637420	4641020	she's like, like you guys aren't, aren't treating me well, we're not going to do
4641020	4641500	Christmas.
4641500	4643140	Like, I feel like that threat is there.
4643140	4648660	Definitely postponement and cause I learned the word postpone by studying
4648660	4654260	notes left by my mother on Easter morning, like, like, like, and Halloween
4654260	4657620	morning and Christmas morning, we would, there would be like a big fight the
4657620	4661220	previous night and then we'd, we'd wake up and it would be like, my brother would
4661220	4664860	go like, there's a note and then we'd look and it would say, Easter has been
4664860	4665780	postponed.
4666660	4669780	And I remember that we're learning that word because by going over it with my
4669780	4673580	brother going, does that mean Easter never will happen or does it mean it'll
4673580	4674260	happen later?
4674260	4677140	And he's like, I don't, I don't, I think it means it'll happen later.
4677500	4678460	And we'd like to look it up.
4678980	4680380	It happens three days later.
4680500	4681660	Uh, yeah, exactly.
4682300	4688100	Uh, but like, like, like, so, so yeah, holiday, holiday control.
4688100	4688460	Yeah.
4688740	4693500	Uh, in, in, in the parental, I don't want to, I don't want to draw analogies that
4693500	4697140	are going to offend anybody, but like, like, like, like young women who have, uh,
4697220	4700380	eating disorders, it's like, like, like you're out of control of everything in
4700380	4700820	your life.
4701060	4706340	There's no, there's no threshold to fucking like, like accomplish anything
4706340	4710940	like, like, like, like that feels like, like change and, and like the default
4710940	4715380	place of like, Oh, well I can, I can eat or not eat for lunch.
4715380	4717020	You know, I can eat less or all these things.
4717020	4720220	Like, and it kind of spirals into the syndrome of like, Oh, that makes me feel
4720220	4721740	comfortable that I'm out of control.
4721980	4724140	I would have like her emotional intake.
4724220	4724940	What am I doing?
4724940	4726380	Why is it like, like, I'm not a therapist.
4726380	4726820	What am I doing?
4727060	4730580	I was like, like, like, look, what, what, my point, what, what is my point?
4730820	4732660	How do we turn this into show?
4732900	4739220	Uh, uh, I was, I was, I was, I was thinking looking down the line that we
4739220	4742140	had a couple of improv trained guys.
4742180	4743380	No, I loved what you were saying.
4743380	4744340	I mean, I agree with you.
4744340	4749220	It does feel like that kind of like a common threat and it comes from a place
4749220	4750820	of my mom not wanting to deal with it.
4750820	4753380	Maybe it comes from a good place or something like that.
4753380	4756860	Like she's, she implies like I'm, she's heard that from a therapist already.
4756900	4759020	Like it's been dimensionalized and personified.
4759020	4759780	She gets it.
4759860	4760100	Yeah.
4760140	4766140	Now, Lauren, like, uh, let's say you had a kid, you know, a boy or a girl, let's
4766140	4766820	say it and see it too.
4766820	4768060	You say you had one of each.
4768300	4772420	Do you think that you would pass any of that on of your, your mother's like
4772460	4772940	hang ups?
4772980	4774980	Do you think that you'd be able to not do that?
4775220	4776940	Or do you think you inherit that too?
4777180	4779860	I, that's why I'm in therapy for my parent.
4779860	4784180	My parents pass down these traits to me and my therapist and I are trying to
4784180	4788860	break those before I get into a relationship or have kids.
4789100	4793380	So I know like that I'm not going to pass those traits on.
4793380	4796780	And hopefully I have more of a healthier relationship with my future
4796780	4798540	whoever or my future kids.
4798580	4801980	Can you tell us like what the language your therapist is using, like encircling
4801980	4805820	this area, like what are the, some of the tools or things that you've learned
4805900	4809060	or anything that's caused like an epiphany about it that you, that sticks
4809060	4813100	out, like, like, just like in talking about your mom and therapy and her
4813100	4815620	relationship with these holidays and canceling them and stuff has your
4815620	4818540	therapist said anything that where you're like, Oh, I remember this.
4818540	4824940	It's like, she likes to tell me like when your mom gets into her screaming
4824940	4827900	fits and things just kind of stay calm.
4827900	4829940	And cause normally I would fight back.
4830060	4833420	I would argue back with her and say like, that's not fair or whatever.
4833420	4834260	You don't understand.
4834540	4838580	Uh, I just would stay calm and like, just say like, okay, mom.
4839100	4839700	Okay, mom.
4840180	4840540	Okay.
4840660	4841580	And you should do that.
4841580	4842020	Why?
4842020	4845100	Because there's this therapist have a theory about what your mom's doing and
4845100	4847020	then how it's going to play itself out.
4847220	4849460	Uh, it's her attention grabbing.
4849500	4853540	She's trying to grab attention because she didn't have attention when she was
4853540	4854220	younger.
4854220	4859260	Oh, but that's, that's a weird, I mean, it's like, like not that something
4859260	4860980	being weird means it doesn't exist.
4860980	4863140	I mean, look at Flamingo's knees, but, but the,
4864860	4874180	the episode title, I lifted that from Oh God, uh, the movie Oh God, um, I'm not a
4874180	4876980	perfect guy looking for me, go sneak up as it's George Burns.
4877020	4877220	Okay.
4877220	4883500	So the, but the, but it is just, I mean, it's just weird thinking like here are
4883500	4888140	these days that are demarcated for specialness and attention and all these
4888140	4894020	things and, but like it, they're being superseded and you're getting, you know,
4894100	4899300	your, your therapist is certain like the stories, are you sure your mom didn't
4899300	4902940	actually endure trauma like, like, like, like from family?
4902940	4905260	It's not, it's not about her needing attention.
4905260	4908500	It's about her actually avoiding trauma.
4908540	4909300	Like, like, like,
4910060	4911460	I think it's more attention.
4911460	4914780	Like she was the, she had like her history and she was the middle child.
4914780	4920100	She wasn't cared about her brother and her sister were, you know, the, oh,
4920140	4921420	they're the best children in the world.
4921420	4922580	She had to do all the chores.
4922660	4925420	I mean, mother's day with your kids, it's, there's, there's not a lot
4925420	4926820	of competition for that corner.
4927980	4930540	It's like, you only have so many kids and it's like, they don't have other
4930540	4932540	moms that are like going to box her out.
4934060	4938740	I could see like, like, like, but, but in her mind, it's like maybe festivity
4938740	4943460	and tradition and stuff, it's all like a ritualistic way of like maybe
4943500	4944940	somehow minimalizing her.
4945980	4951060	Lauren, how much do you think that you like inherit your mother's traits?
4951060	4953100	Like how much of you is she?
4955580	4961380	I would say like, I'm, I share 50, 50 of my father and my mom, like, I
4961380	4965020	mean, physicality, like looks and stuff and personality.
4965020	4965980	Are you close with your dad?
4966060	4970580	I kind of, I am, I feel like I'm closer with my dad.
4971180	4976540	But then mom, then mom, because mom tends to push away a little bit more
4976700	4985100	because she says she's, she's tried enough and my dad, he, he will still reach
4985100	4988700	out, even if he's angry at me, though, like time will pass and then he'll
4988700	4989620	try to reach out.
4989940	4992020	My mom says that she's done enough.
4992660	4993580	She's tried enough.
4993580	4995260	There's like these hints at backstory with your mom.
4995260	4998420	Like she's somehow been victimized in the past, not only by her parents,
4998420	4999860	but actually by you guys.
4999860	5004420	Yeah, we, I mean, it was really hard because my dad was, when they got
5004420	5006820	divorced, it was a very ugly divorce.
5006860	5010780	She felt, oh, she felt, she felt, she felt like she was in a pageant
5010820	5012260	to like compete as a parent.
5012260	5013380	Yeah, my parents do that.
5013380	5014820	They feel like they need to compete.
5014820	5018500	My mom felt like she needed to give us anything and everything we wanted.
5018860	5025060	And then we kind of, my dad on the other end was telling us like, oh, your mom,
5025100	5026100	you know, she's a liar.
5026100	5028220	She's, you know, she left you guys.
5028620	5032700	She left you with us or left, left me with you guys.
5033700	5037140	And then like things like child support, like your mom didn't give
5037140	5038860	enough money for child support.
5038860	5042780	And so, I mean, it's this really vicious cycle.
5042780	5044500	Are you and your brother close?
5044500	5046180	Kind of, not really.
5046180	5048020	Our family's kind of broken.
5048020	5049740	It's all, it's all fractious.
5049780	5050780	Yeah.
5050780	5051500	I was OK.
5051500	5054540	So well, so I was going to I was going to have somebody come up and then I was
5054540	5057340	going to like maybe fix their problem in the form of like an improv scene.
5057340	5058340	Not doing that.
5059380	5060380	Oh, my God.
5061380	5063380	That would be, I'm pretty problematizing.
5063380	5064380	Oh, thank you.
5065380	5068380	Like I didn't I wasn't entertained by the podcast where Lauren was just sitting
5068380	5072380	there crying and you while you guys made jokes about the mythologizing her
5072380	5075380	situation. But it's amazing that you can come up and talk about that and be like
5075380	5076380	that open about it.
5076380	5078380	Yeah. Thank you so much for bearing that stuff.
5078380	5079380	I got aware of that.
5081380	5082380	Thank you.
5082380	5085380	I'm sorry, but but stay here for a second.
5085380	5086380	Life.
5086380	5087380	Life all comes at a price.
5087380	5089380	Like we all pay a price for being ourselves.
5089380	5093380	And like like you didn't you didn't earn or deserve any of that.
5093380	5098380	But you're trying your best to like not pass that along.
5098380	5102380	And we'd be like clearly if you had a kid, I think we can all agree that you would
5102380	5103380	be a good mom.
5104380	5114380	Because maybe the maybe the exercise is to is to prove that with a scene.
5114380	5121380	We'll do a radio play improvised radio play and your role.
5121380	5124380	Don't worry. You don't have to be like like Johnny on the spot or anything.
5124380	5129380	We'll just you can just say like you'll be the matriarch of a family.
5129380	5134380	And we'll and we'll just we're the kids.
5134380	5137380	Well, we'll we'll start with like.
5137380	5139380	Yeah. Well, we'll start with her.
5139380	5147380	Yes. Well, I'll be I'll be your I'll be your husband.
5147380	5150380	I'm assuming you if you foresee yourself having kids, you foresee yourself.
5150380	5153380	I don't want to heteronormatize you or anything.
5153380	5157380	Like do you see yourself as like married to a dude that has a then you have a kid
5157380	5162380	with them as like a nuclear situation or is there some other fantasy in your head
5162380	5165380	of like of family just having kids.
5165380	5166380	Okay.
5166380	5167380	It doesn't need to be anything special.
5167380	5169380	Not with a big. Okay.
5169380	5171380	But okay. So I'm being over cautious.
5171380	5174380	I just like by the way, I'm a lesbian.
5174380	5176380	You totally offended me the whole time.
5178380	5179380	Okay. So I'll be your husband.
5179380	5185380	And then we're at the hospital and we just we just had our first kid together.
5185380	5191380	And then we'll we'll do like an Avalon type thing where we we move through the ages
5192380	5197380	and you and I'll grow old together and die as our family as our family as our family
5197380	5200380	kind of continues as they have a family of their own and things.
5200380	5204380	And you and I'll die of old age happy assuming that that's part of the thing.
5204380	5207380	Okay. All right. But right now we're 25.
5210380	5212380	Lauren's world. Okay.
5215380	5217380	Hey, baby. Did it hurt?
5222380	5223380	No.
5224380	5225380	Oh, good. God.
5225380	5226380	Everyone says it hurts.
5226380	5230380	I they said they're going to bring the baby in.
5230380	5234380	I thank you so much for doing this.
5234380	5236380	You're welcome.
5236380	5239380	Lauren Dan. I'm Dr.
5239380	5243380	Schwarzman. I have good news and bad news.
5243380	5246380	You have two babies.
5247380	5252380	One baby is a super special baby.
5253380	5256380	One baby kind of an asshole.
5257380	5260380	Well, they're both going to be special to us, isn't that right, baby?
5260380	5261380	Yes, definitely.
5261380	5263380	Okay. Well, let's bring them in.
5263380	5277380	Well, they look to me. They look the same.
5277380	5279380	I think it's great that we had two babies.
5279380	5281380	Mommy. Daddy.
5281380	5282380	They're already speaking.
5282380	5284380	Whoa. That's crazy.
5285380	5288380	Also, sorry, Dr. Schwarzman again.
5288380	5291380	One of your babies can already speak English.
5292380	5295380	Well, you're stepping on the second baby's line.
5295380	5296380	Aww.
5297380	5299380	What's up, you dipshits?
5300380	5302380	Oh, my God. What a mislead.
5303380	5306380	It's the baby that could... Okay.
5307380	5309380	Well, they both...
5309380	5312380	Dr. Schwarzman, I'm leaving you. You're on your own now.
5312380	5313380	Okay.
5313380	5315380	All right. Well, let's get them home.
5315380	5317380	I'm assuming there's equipment and things you probably have to...
5317380	5319380	They probably take a credit card.
5319380	5322380	All right. We'll take the two special seats
5322380	5328380	and the bungee cord and the two bottles, I guess.
5328380	5331380	Diapers? Should throw some diapers in.
5331380	5335380	Who cares? Anything's more comfortable than that pussy I just got out of.
5342380	5345380	You know what I just realized? We haven't named them yet.
5346380	5349380	Because I'm like, well, this one, oh, my God, the mouth on him.
5350380	5352380	Call me Tony.
5352380	5354380	What? He picked his own name.
5356380	5359380	He's so exceptional. Oh, my God.
5361380	5363380	And...
5363380	5365380	Name myself.
5367380	5368380	Fucking dumbass.
5369380	5371380	Hey, whoa, Tony.
5371380	5372380	Hey, sorry, sorry.
5373380	5376380	My name is Baby Angel.
5378380	5381380	I love Baby Angel. I love both of you. You're amazing.
5382380	5384380	One month later,
5386380	5390380	the babies are making noise.
5390380	5393380	It's my turn, right? I'll go...
5393380	5396380	I guess I'll go see what's going on in the baby's room.
5397380	5398380	Shit.
5400380	5402380	I got a fucking log in my pants.
5402380	5404380	Show me out.
5412380	5415380	I mean, it's so hard to stay mad at you,
5416380	5420380	because you're so above board about everything, but...
5421380	5423380	How you doing, Angel?
5424380	5427380	Tony tried to garret me with a mobile cord.
5430380	5431380	Tony?
5432380	5435380	Stay away from my pass-by, you little bitch. Stay on your side of the room.
5436380	5439380	You guys are sharing a crib. You're just a month old.
5439380	5442380	Like, you're not supposed to be, first of all, talking.
5442380	5444380	Second of all, garreting.
5444380	5447380	Third of all, understanding possession.
5449380	5451380	We had hoped to avoid that.
5451380	5453380	It's like a runaway train.
5453380	5457380	Well, here, let me change your diaper. Come here. Come here, Tony.
5459380	5462380	Sorry, you're not. I'm excited, too, by the way.
5462380	5464380	Jesus Christ.
5466380	5468380	Rock soft.
5470380	5474380	Daddy, why did you only circumcise one of us?
5474380	5488380	Well, daddy's Jewish, and mom's Lutheran, and you're our little angel,
5488380	5493380	so we felt you were chosen, and so we circumcised you.
5494380	5498380	Is that the answer you were looking for? It's an answer.
5499380	5502380	Why are you asking the questions, buddy?
5502380	5506380	I'm the one who's gonna do with all this shmegma and so on.
5512380	5513380	Great.
5514380	5516380	Oh, shit.
5516380	5518380	It's three in the morning. Hello?
5518380	5520380	Hello. Is Lauren there?
5521380	5523380	This is her mother.
5523380	5526380	Oh, okay. Jesus Christ, okay.
5529380	5531380	Put me on speaker.
5532380	5535380	Well, I'm walking the phone to the master bedroom.
5535380	5538380	Put me on speaker. I never liked you. I never liked you, Dan.
5540380	5543380	Well, Anastasia, I've never cared.
5544380	5546380	Put my daughter on the phone.
5546380	5547380	Lauren.
5547380	5548380	Lauren.
5548380	5549380	Yes?
5549380	5550380	It's your mom.
5550380	5551380	Oh, yay.
5551380	5553380	I'm gonna put her on speaker.
5553380	5554380	Okay.
5554380	5555380	That's by her request.
5556380	5558380	Sorry, my phone's so wet.
5561380	5562380	Lauren, are you there?
5562380	5563380	Yes.
5563380	5565380	Mother's Day is canceled. Click.
5567380	5569380	Why does she do that every year?
5570380	5572380	Because she just does.
5573380	5574380	I mean...
5576380	5578380	All right. Well, that didn't land.
5578380	5580380	Cancel for her.
5580380	5582380	Yeah. Well, yeah.
5582380	5584380	All right. Hello?
5584380	5587380	Oh, shit. Sorry. I was calling somebody else.
5588380	5589380	Click.
5589380	5591380	I feel like she just wants attention.
5591380	5594380	Like, I know it seems crazy, but I feel like she wants attention.
5594380	5597380	Like, she's fucking... This is what she does.
5597380	5599380	All right. The kids, I left Tony's.
5599380	5601380	Tony took a huge shit.
5601380	5603380	His dick is gigantic,
5603380	5607380	and Angel's already asking questions about the circumcision.
5608380	5609380	Okay.
5609380	5611380	But get sleep. Get sleep, baby. Get some sleep.
5611380	5612380	Thank you.
5613380	5614380	All right, guys.
5614380	5615380	Hello.
5615380	5616380	What the hell?
5616380	5617380	This is Tony. Go ahead.
5617380	5618380	What?
5618380	5620380	Yeah, what do you need? Okay.
5622380	5624380	Two pounds of kielbasa.
5627380	5629380	20 ounce stretch of dick.
5630380	5633380	Tony, are you running a small business?
5637380	5640380	I got myself a little deli. Yeah, I opened it up.
5642380	5644380	Give me that.
5644380	5645380	Hey.
5645380	5646380	Hey.
5646380	5648380	There's an internet now.
5648380	5650380	Oh, now who's phone?
5650380	5652380	How did you even get your own phone? Hello?
5652380	5655380	Can I get an egg salad on Ryan?
5655380	5658380	Too loud because of an egg cream.
5658380	5661380	You're calling him one month old.
5661380	5664380	Yeah, but he has the best egg salad in town.
5665380	5667380	Also got a big dick.
5669380	5671380	You hate that.
5671380	5674380	I know what the secret is for the egg salad.
5675380	5677380	I use mom's eggs.
5677380	5679380	I use mommy's eggs.
5680380	5683380	You're laughing so much while you're saying it.
5683380	5685380	It's hard to make it out.
5685380	5687380	You're saying you use mommy's eggs.
5687380	5688380	That's what you said.
5688380	5689380	I use mommy's eggs.
5691380	5698380	You, in 2020, you have eschewed internet culture
5698380	5701380	and created a telephone-based deli
5702380	5706380	and have learned to harvest eggs in a month.
5707380	5709380	And you're laughing about it.
5709380	5711380	What's it do you, buddy?
5716380	5719380	Angel, you're right. Have you shit your pants?
5720380	5723380	The doctor said one of us was special
5723380	5726380	and one of us would be kind of an asshole.
5727380	5729380	And I'm starting to wonder,
5729380	5732380	maybe Tony's the one who's special
5733380	5736380	and maybe I'm the one who's kind of an asshole.
5736380	5738380	That's what special people always think.
5738380	5740380	You're going to be like me. You're going to be a writer.
5743380	5744380	Hello?
5744380	5745380	Dr. Schwartzman here.
5746380	5749380	Angel Baby, he's the asshole.
5753380	5755380	We just got the test results.
5757380	5759380	Sorry. I got to go.
5760380	5762380	Oh, shit. My sandwich is here.
5765380	5766380	Did you order a...
5768380	5769380	Paola.
5771380	5772380	All right.
5773380	5776380	One year later, at Disneyland...
5778380	5780380	All right, guys.
5780380	5783380	Looks like there's a Dumbo ride.
5783380	5785380	Hold on to the enhancing glasses.
5785380	5788380	This here is the wildest ride in the wilderness.
5790380	5791380	Dumbo.
5791380	5793380	They've kind of westernized the Dumbo ride.
5793380	5794380	Notice.
5795380	5797380	Ever since the Will Smith movie.
5800380	5802380	They changed the rides to fit the movie.
5802380	5803380	Dumbo's a cowboy.
5803380	5804380	Remain seated, please.
5808380	5810380	This is fucking boring.
5810380	5813380	Hey, Tony, what did I say in the parking lot?
5813380	5816380	I want to go see the baby from Roger Rabbit that's a lot like me.
5816380	5818380	You know the one I'm talking about.
5823380	5829380	Just be quiet and watch the show that we're in or the ride that we're on.
5829380	5832380	What are you going to say, Angel, you dumb asshole?
5833380	5838380	Tony told me that the real Splash Mountain is...
5839380	5842380	What happens to girls' pussies when he's around?
5846380	5850380	Tony, what are you? What are you, a Comedy Central writer?
5853380	5855380	You're one year old.
5856380	5859380	Hey, he's got to learn it sooner or later, you know what I mean?
5860380	5863380	Lauren, can I see you for a moment?
5863380	5866380	Kids, stay here. Eat your cotton candy.
5867380	5868380	Lauren.
5868380	5869380	Yes?
5869380	5871380	What if we left them?
5874380	5876380	What if we just left Tony?
5879380	5882380	You know, just imagine you and me and baby Angel.
5883380	5885380	Just Venice Beach.
5886380	5888380	You could get a trailer.
5889380	5892380	They'd be like one of those oscillating fans.
5892380	5893380	Tempting.
5894380	5895380	But you don't...
5895380	5897380	No, you're supposed to love them.
5897380	5899380	Because you want to be a good mom.
5899380	5900380	I want to be a good mom.
5900380	5901380	Obviously.
5901380	5902380	You want to be a good father, right?
5902380	5903380	Yeah, I do.
5903380	5904380	I do.
5904380	5906380	But, I mean, we couldn't have predicted this.
5908380	5910380	Life happens.
5910380	5913380	Okay, all right. Thank you. You brought me strength. Thank you.
5914380	5915380	Mommy? Daddy?
5915380	5916380	Oh, hey, Angel?
5916380	5918380	I snuck away from Tony.
5918380	5919380	Oh.
5919380	5920380	I have an idea.
5921380	5924380	Let's leave them in a hot monorail car.
5932380	5934380	Hey, what's going on over here?
5934380	5936380	Nothing. Nothing.
5937380	5943380	Well, let's put a pin in that and let's all take the monorail to a different area of the park.
5943380	5944380	Yeah.
5944380	5946380	Let's go to the vault.
5946380	5949380	I want to see some of that anti-juice stuff that Disney loves.
5950380	5951380	You bet.
5951380	5954380	As long as the monorail takes us there.
5954380	5955380	Two tickets, please.
5955380	5958380	And two juniors.
5958380	5961380	Welcome to anti-Semitic town.
5962380	5964380	That's what I'm talking about.
5966380	5969380	I can't believe this exists.
5970380	5971380	All right.
5973380	5974380	Well, here we are.
5974380	5975380	Hey. Oh, Tony.
5975380	5983380	I think Daddy left his iPad Mini under a seat up there toward the front of the car.
5983380	5986380	About 90 yards from the door.
5986380	5988380	Oh, I got you. Hold on a second. Let me see here.
5988380	5989380	Come on. Come on.
5989380	5990380	Lauren.
5990380	5991380	No.
5992380	5995380	There's no fucking iPad under here.
5995380	5997380	Monorail now leaving. Door is locked.
5997380	5998380	Lauren!
5998380	5999380	Lauren!
6001380	6003380	Lauren!
6005380	6008380	All right. Angel, run. Run for the parking lot.
6008380	6010380	Your mom can raise Tony. Run.
6017380	6019380	Keys. Keys. Keys. Keys.
6019380	6021380	God damn it. Keys.
6021380	6023380	I only have baby keys.
6024380	6025380	Hold on.
6025380	6026380	Daddy's got to make a phone call.
6026380	6027380	Angel, get in the back.
6027380	6028380	Strap yourself in.
6028380	6029380	Okay.
6029380	6030380	Hello. 911.
6030380	6031380	Something happened.
6031380	6037380	Disneyland. And my wife and my cat are on a monorail.
6037380	6040380	This sounds like a bad performance, sir.
6040380	6042380	Did you kill your wife and child?
6042380	6046380	No, they're alive. Go find them. God damn it. Fuck.
6046380	6049380	I don't even know what else. Angel, you and I.
6049380	6050380	Boo!
6050380	6051380	Shit.
6051380	6052380	Boo!
6052380	6053380	Shit.
6053380	6055380	Fuck. Hey, let me out.
6055380	6058380	Do you know how fast you were going, sir?
6058380	6060380	Zero. I was parked in the...
6062380	6064380	We're in the Buzz Lightyear lot.
6065380	6067380	All right. On you go.
6069380	6071380	Shit. I thought they were... Okay.
6071380	6074380	Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here.
6074380	6076380	Giraffe section. What the hell?
6076380	6077380	Boo!
6077380	6079380	Oh, God damn it.
6079380	6080380	Oh, fuck.
6080380	6081380	Do you know how fast you were going?
6081380	6083380	I had 12.
6083380	6084380	Correct. On you go.
6084380	6092380	Listen, Angel, there are people and there are people.
6092380	6095380	And people can't control to whom they're born and who they're raised by.
6095380	6099380	But you and I, like, we are simpatico, okay?
6099380	6101380	And I love your mother so fucking much.
6101380	6105380	And I wish that she wasn't so dedicated to being a good mother.
6105380	6109380	Because now she has to be with that turd for the rest of her life.
6109380	6112380	Cut to the hot monorail with Lauren and Tony.
6112380	6115380	Holy shit. It's fucking hot up in here.
6119380	6123380	Might as well climb back up your vouch, you know what I'm saying?
6127380	6130380	That's a thing Italians say, right, mama?
6130380	6132380	Yeah, sure.
6134380	6136380	Oh, ma, we're going to die, aren't we?
6136380	6138380	Um, hopefully not.
6138380	6142380	What? Hopefully we'll see your brother and your father again.
6142380	6144380	Oh, it's fucking over.
6144380	6147380	I'm going to start tearing out my little baby hair, I guess.
6147380	6150380	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's going to be fine.
6150380	6152380	No!
6160380	6163380	Buh-buh, buh-buh, CBS News.
6165380	6169380	A mother and a child are trapped in a hot monorail
6169380	6173380	between Disney and downtown Disney.
6175380	6178380	The baby seems to be from New York for some reason.
6181380	6183380	Pretty salty?
6183380	6186380	Meanwhile, in the basement of the Pentagon,
6188380	6192380	we close in on a hissing cryogenic chamber
6192380	6196380	until, as the camera reaches the latches,
6196380	6198380	they pop open.
6198380	6202380	A familiar man leans forward, gasping for air.
6202380	6206380	Someone needs help. It's Walt Disney.
6207380	6210380	Mr. Disney, we told you that you wouldn't wake up
6210380	6212380	until the year 2038.
6212380	6216380	Well, that's where I second-guessed you, C.
6216380	6220380	I designed my cryogenic chamber to also react
6220380	6224380	to scenarios of peril at my own Disney world.
6224380	6229380	So are you aware that we have a hot monorail crisis going up?
6229380	6232380	Corporal, I can't hear you over the sound
6232380	6235380	of me strapping on this jetpack.
6236380	6238380	Disney away!
6242380	6247380	Can you read my mind?
6247380	6253380	I'm one person flying higher than I ever have.
6253380	6256380	Every star is a cup of water.
6256380	6258380	Every moon, there's only one.
6258380	6261380	I will eat it like a cupcake.
6261380	6264380	I will also touch the sun.
6265380	6266380	Hello?
6266380	6268380	Hello. It's Walt Disney?
6268380	6269380	Yes.
6269380	6270380	It's your lawyers.
6270380	6273380	Why did you create anti-Semitic town in Disneyland?
6273380	6275380	Oh, is that still going?
6275380	6278380	Oh, for criminy, geez.
6278380	6281380	I'll take care of it.
6281380	6283380	Jarvis!
6285380	6287380	Yes, sir?
6287380	6289380	Take target.
6289380	6291380	The monorail.
6292380	6294380	Right away, sir.
6299380	6302380	Let's pop a hole in this can.
6302380	6303380	I'm snarky.
6303380	6305380	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
6305380	6309380	Walt Disney, it's me, your enemy,
6309380	6312380	Knott's Berry Farm.
6315380	6318380	I don't even know who you are.
6319380	6321380	Don't be a dick.
6322380	6324380	We got Monorail's Revenge.
6324380	6326380	It's a pretty good park.
6327380	6329380	I've heated up your monorails
6329380	6333380	to almost unbearable temperatures.
6333380	6336380	A mother and her son are about to die.
6336380	6340380	Well, I guess we just need a little help
6340380	6346380	from our friends like the Frozen Girl.
6347380	6350380	Make it real.
6350380	6351380	Make it real.
6351380	6352380	Make it alive.
6352380	6354380	I can't remember the song.
6354380	6355380	Let it go.
6355380	6356380	Let it go.
6356380	6358380	Let it go.
6358380	6359380	Make it go.
6359380	6360380	Make it real.
6360380	6363380	It's the copyright version.
6363380	6365380	Make it real.
6365380	6368380	Make it so.
6370380	6372380	Ah, now the whole monorail's cold
6372380	6375380	as a Jiminy Cricket.
6375380	6378380	Wait, we need someone to lasso that speeding monorail.
6378380	6380380	Look, it's Woody from Toy Story.
6380380	6383380	You are a guy I know.
6384380	6387380	You are a guy I know.
6390380	6391380	I got it.
6391380	6393380	That'll slow it down to a crawl
6393380	6395380	and eventually a stop.
6395380	6397380	We can get that baby and that mommy out of there.
6397380	6401380	And to help, if only there were just a couple of fish
6401380	6405380	from Pixar's fish movie, Fish.
6407380	6408380	We're here.
6408380	6409380	You are a...
6409380	6410380	You are a...
6410380	6413380	We got a special situation.
6417380	6419380	I was so racing to the point of,
6419380	6422380	Randy Newman's songs are the same.
6424380	6425380	I couldn't fucking...
6425380	6427380	I couldn't obey the rules of improv.
6427380	6428380	I was like, no, I get it.
6428380	6429380	I'm mine.
6429380	6430380	I will eat rare.
6430380	6432380	When we get there, Randy's mine.
6434380	6435380	Walt, are you okay?
6435380	6436380	Sorry.
6436380	6437380	Sorry, guys.
6439380	6442380	Now, could y'all just give me a moment
6442380	6444380	while I go down into the monorail car
6444380	6446380	and see to these two?
6446380	6448380	I've always had a special place for
6448380	6450380	dissatisfied customers.
6452380	6454380	Holy shit.
6454380	6456380	Fucking Walt himself.
6457380	6460380	What's going on?
6460380	6463380	Well, aren't you an articulate little man?
6464380	6465380	I pulled all my hair out.
6465380	6467380	I look like Tony Soprano.
6467380	6468380	It's a good thing.
6468380	6469380	It's good.
6470380	6472380	I'm happy about it.
6476380	6478380	Young lady, is this your son?
6478380	6479380	Yes.
6479380	6482380	I'm awful sorry you had a bad time at Disneyland.
6483380	6485380	Can I just say,
6486380	6488380	that you should make it
6488380	6490380	so you can just stop the monorails,
6490380	6492380	you know what I mean?
6496380	6498380	They also said you should make it
6498380	6500380	so anti-Semitic town doesn't happen.
6500380	6501380	I can't control everything.
6501380	6503380	Oh, fucks.
6503380	6504380	You need some of that stuff,
6504380	6505380	you know what I mean?
6505380	6508380	You can't problemize everything.
6508380	6515380	Sometimes the tail wags the dog.
6515380	6518380	Speaking of which,
6518380	6521380	what if I were to say to you, young man,
6521380	6524380	that I had a special island
6524380	6527380	where aggressive boys like you,
6527380	6529380	who maybe don't fit in as much
6529380	6532380	when held to the standard of humanity,
6532380	6534380	can be more adorable
6534380	6536380	when surgically augmented
6536380	6538380	to be half animal?
6540380	6543380	There ain't Jewish guys over there or no?
6543380	6544380	Sure.
6544380	6548380	Dr. Moreau has changed his name
6548380	6551380	to work in showbiz surgery.
6551380	6552380	You know what I mean?
6552380	6553380	No matter what,
6553380	6555380	take me to that fucking island, Walt.
6555380	6559380	Ma'am, what if I were to tell you
6559380	6561380	that the best thing you could do
6561380	6563380	for this child was to let him go
6563380	6564380	to a special island
6564380	6568380	where he'd be mutilated surgically?
6568380	6571380	Rejoin your husband with the good child.
6571380	6573380	Live out your days.
6573380	6575380	But I love him.
6575380	6577380	Well, what is love, really?
6577380	6578380	When it's unconditional,
6578380	6581380	then can't you just love a fire hydrant?
6581380	6582380	True.
6582380	6585380	Isn't all love somehow conditional?
6585380	6587380	Aren't we therefore somehow accountable
6587380	6589380	to whether or not we are loved?
6589380	6591380	Aren't the people that get that
6591380	6594380	the ones that become truly creative
6594380	6597380	in an endless quest to make things,
6597380	6600380	whether they be bad movies
6600380	6602380	or giant theme parks
6602380	6606380	and always just trying to get people to love us
6606380	6609380	that didn't love us very much?
6609380	6614380	I think if this child were to have floppy ears
6614380	6617380	grafted to the side of his head,
6617380	6621380	fed spam from a stainless steel bowl
6621380	6623380	and regularly whipped
6623380	6627380	with a crazy Jedi electric whip
6627380	6630380	so it didn't feel as violent
6630380	6633380	because it's like sci-fi violence.
6633380	6637380	I told you, I'm fucking in already.
6637380	6639380	You're waiting for my fucking balls
6639380	6641380	to drop over here. Let's go.
6641380	6646380	I just want to make sure
6646380	6648380	the young lady's okay with it.
6648380	6650380	I don't know if that's what he wants.
6650380	6651380	Well, I'm Italian.
6651380	6652380	I'm potty animal anyways.
6652380	6653380	Let me go.
6653380	6655380	That is true.
6655380	6659380	So racist, but so are animals,
6659380	6660380	and we love them.
6660380	6662380	Disney, yay, yay, yay!
6662380	6666380	Yahoo!
6666380	6669380	And Walt Disney turned into a rocket
6669380	6673380	and took the baby Tony to a special island
6673380	6676380	where he was never seen again.
6676380	6679380	Lauren returned to giraffe parking
6679380	6682380	where Dan and baby Angel
6682380	6686380	were still unable to figure out how to get out.
6686380	6689380	Oh, shit, it's your mother.
6689380	6691380	Play it cool.
6691380	6692380	Hey, baby.
6692380	6693380	Hey.
6693380	6694380	Hi, mama.
6694380	6695380	Hi.
6695380	6696380	We were just coming to get you.
6696380	6698380	We were going to pull the car around.
6698380	6701380	Whatever you were.
6701380	6709380	You know I left you for dead in a hot monorail.
6709380	6711380	I guess for all our effort,
6711380	6720380	we're just all a big pile of whatever happened to us.
6720380	6724380	Sure.
6724380	6725380	Tony's gone.
6725380	6727380	I noticed, I noticed.
6727380	6729380	Are you stoked?
6729380	6731380	I let him be what he wanted to be.
6731380	6732380	Nice.
6732380	6733380	Yeah.
6733380	6734380	Dead or just missing?
6734380	6737380	Apparently he's going to an island.
6737380	6739380	He's going to be a half animal.
6739380	6740380	I love it.
6740380	6744380	But what of his thriving deli business?
6744380	6750380	Oh, shit.
6750380	6752380	Who's going to answer that?
6752380	6753380	I don't know.
6753380	6755380	That's his phone, I'll answer it.
6755380	6756380	Hello?
6756380	6760380	I ordered a pastrami like fucking four days ago.
6760380	6763380	Where's my goddamn sandwich?
6763380	6764380	Where?
6764380	6765380	Where?
6765380	6769380	You reached a baby, clique.
6769380	6773380	Now that's a Mother's Day.
6773380	6775380	Yay.
6775380	6776380	You're the best.
6776380	6777380	There he is.
6777380	6779380	Nothing's going on, baby.
6779380	6780380	You're the best.
6780380	6782380	You're the best.
6782380	6784380	Mother wasn't fair.
6784380	6790380	When you're on top, on the top for the Mother's Day.
6790380	6793380	Panavision.
6793380	6794380	Was it good?
6794380	6795380	That was good.
6795380	6797380	I think we got to the...
6797380	6798380	Let's thank Lauren, everybody.
6798380	6799380	Lauren.
6799380	6804380	Thank you, Lauren, for sharing your pain.
6804380	6806380	We fucking did it.
6806380	6808380	We solved Mother's Day.
6808380	6810380	We fixed Mother's Day.
6810380	6811380	Right?
6811380	6813380	Didn't we?
6813380	6814380	No.
6814380	6815380	No.
6815380	6816380	Were you traveling?
6816380	6820380	I think we made it worse, didn't we?
6820380	6822380	You're lonelier now than you were when you came out.
6822380	6823380	No.
6823380	6824380	I love this place.
6824380	6826380	Here's what the Doughboys are.
6826380	6828380	Here's some shitty advice from us.
6828380	6830380	Tomorrow can be your Mother's Day.
6830380	6834380	Bring her over some dinner or something and you can patch it all up tomorrow if you'd like.
6834380	6835380	That's what I was planning.
6835380	6837380	The holiday doesn't matter.
6837380	6841380	Yeah, bring her something to eat and you guys will work it out, right?
6841380	6844380	She seems like the type of mom that'll be like, is this a secret Mother's Day?
6844380	6845380	Yeah, she is.
6845380	6846380	So cut you off with a pass.
6846380	6847380	That's true.
6847380	6850380	Yeah, not everything can be solved by food, I guess.
6850380	6852380	But your podcast can.
6852380	6855380	Doughboys is on every Wednesday at 3 p.m.
6855380	6857380	You don't have a time slot.
6857380	6859380	No, thank you so much, Lauren.
6859380	6867380	Is there anything else we don't want you to be voicelessly railroaded by our mirth?
6867380	6871380	Anything else?
6871380	6873380	I don't know.
6873380	6875380	I'm bad at it.
6875380	6879380	My mom doesn't listen to this.
6879380	6880380	Do you love your mom?
6880380	6881380	I love my mom.
6881380	6882380	You must.
6882380	6883380	I love my mom.
6883380	6884380	I love my stepmom.
6884380	6887380	I love my other moms that I consider mothers to me.
6887380	6888380	My best friend's mother.
6888380	6889380	I love her.
6889380	6891380	Live with her now.
6891380	6893380	Whoo!
6893380	6894380	All right.
6894380	6895380	Props to all those mothers.
6895380	6896380	All right.
6896380	6897380	Thank you, Lauren.
6897380	6898380	Thank you.
6898380	6905380	Thank you, Lauren.
6905380	6906380	So she does have a lot of moms.
6906380	6911380	So her mom is, like, getting boxed out.
6911380	6914380	That's what we learned right at the end.
6914380	6916380	Not really, though.
6916380	6920380	I said that's not the most healthy way to think of it.
6920380	6921380	Oh, okay.
6921380	6922380	Well, it's...
6922380	6923380	That's true, though.
6923380	6924380	It's true.
6924380	6927380	Captain Elf.
6927380	6933380	Foster Brooks is here.
6933380	6935380	That is not the most healthy way to think about it.
6935380	6939380	Or the most healthy way to say what you said.
6939380	6942380	Because it sounds like you've...
6942380	6943380	Okay, never mind.
6943380	6944380	All right.
6944380	6945380	No, no, no.
6945380	6946380	I wasn't going to...
6946380	6948380	Now, Dan, will you call mom or no?
6948380	6949380	I texted her.
6949380	6950380	I texted her.
6950380	6952380	For God's sake, we like it that way.
6952380	6953380	That's it?
6953380	6954380	We got it.
6954380	6955380	We got it.
6955380	6957380	She wouldn't like a call better than a text?
6957380	6958380	Fart on you.
6958380	6961380	I texted her.
6961380	6962380	What did she say?
6962380	6963380	Did she text you back?
6963380	6964380	Yeah.
6964380	6965380	What did she say?
6965380	6966380	She said...
6966380	6967380	I don't know.
6967380	6968380	She...
6968380	6969380	Great.
6969380	6972380	If I read her texts, then it'll be...
6972380	6975380	Wouldn't that just make the problem worse?
6975380	6976380	I kind of feel like...
6976380	6979380	I don't know why my parents didn't come to my wedding.
6980380	6984380	I kind of feel like maybe it was because maybe they didn't want to...
6984380	6989380	Maybe part of the whole thing of me talking about my life and stuff maybe
6989380	6991380	is off-putting to them.
6991380	6998380	So I don't want to read my mom's text for fodder
6998380	7002380	because on the off chance that that is the thing, I don't want to...
7002380	7004380	Was she happy to hear from you?
7004380	7006380	It's a text, man.
7006380	7008380	She was like...
7008380	7011380	I think you should bring her a meal tomorrow.
7012380	7016380	Is something from Olive Garden or Checky Chainz?
7016380	7018380	From Tony's Deli.
7018380	7019380	All right.
7019380	7022380	Well, what have you learned this whole time, Spencer?
7024380	7025380	Come on, man.
7025380	7027380	Why don't you give me all the hard questions?
7027380	7028380	End my show!
7028380	7029380	Yeah, exactly.
7029380	7030380	No, I'm not going to.
7030380	7031380	All right.
7031380	7032380	I'll sit here.
7033380	7034380	All right.
7034380	7039380	Well, then I'll go back to the dregs of the fucking shitty note app
7039380	7041380	because we don't have an ending.
7041380	7045380	My chiropractor is a piece of shit, but he's really nice.
7045380	7047380	Nobody came tonight because my mother said...
7047380	7048380	How's your back?
7048380	7049380	My back's great.
7049380	7050380	Look at me.
7050380	7051380	I'm doing high kicks.
7051380	7052380	Is it better?
7052380	7053380	It's great.
7053380	7054380	It's great.
7054380	7055380	Oh, Seek.
7055380	7061380	Seek is here, but you can't bring him up now because Seek's doing well.
7061380	7062380	Yeah, he's doing better.
7062380	7063380	Yeah.
7063380	7064380	Awesome.
7067380	7069380	But let's problematize that.
7069380	7070380	Who says Seek's doing better?
7070380	7071380	Seek.
7071380	7072380	He does.
7072380	7073380	Yeah.
7073380	7074380	Who's he talking to?
7074380	7075380	Us.
7075380	7076380	Yeah.
7076380	7077380	And why is he doing that?
7077380	7079380	Because he cares about himself and us.
7079380	7080380	Exactly.
7080380	7081380	Racist.
7083380	7084380	And us.
7086380	7087380	All right.
7087380	7088380	Tap Titans.
7088380	7089380	Tap Galaxy.
7089380	7090380	Tap Tycoon.
7090380	7091380	Tap Titans.
7093380	7094380	All right.
7094380	7095380	That's it.
7097380	7098380	Do you want to do a little song?
7098380	7099380	Is there...
7099380	7101380	Yeah, but not a rap.
7101380	7103380	Is there anything that's not a rap?
7103380	7104380	Like just a song?
7104380	7106380	A family?
7106380	7107380	I think...
7107380	7108380	Yeah.
7108380	7110380	You want to do a little song?
7110380	7112380	What do you want it to be about?
7112380	7114380	What we've learned.
7114380	7115380	Okay.
7121380	7122380	No.
7125380	7127380	And what if I had said potatoes?
7127380	7129380	Would you have played something else?
7129380	7131380	I want it to be about potatoes.
7137380	7139380	That seems like a rap.
7139380	7141380	Okay, but that doesn't have to be.
7141380	7142380	All right.
7142380	7143380	Yeah.
7143380	7144380	Oh, here it is.
7144380	7145380	This is it.
7145380	7146380	Yeah.
7146380	7147380	Here we go.
