0	15000	From Hollywood, California, Nerd Melt Studios, Harman Town is now in session.
15000	18000	Thank you, thank you.
18000	25000	I am your guest comptroller, Spencer Crittenden.
26000	30000	Thank you, thank you. You're too kind, that's very kind.
30000	34000	But please give it up to the person you're really here to see,
34000	44000	the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman!
44000	46000	Thank you, thank you.
49000	52000	Guest comptroller, Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
52000	56000	Yeah, man.
56000	58000	It's a bare bones show tonight.
58000	60000	Yeah, it's fucking hot, man.
60000	66000	You know, the thing about comptroller that people don't know is you gotta wear a suit to do it.
66000	70000	We have a lot of guests and they don't get that memo or whatever,
70000	74000	but you gotta wear a suit, and I would have worn one, but I would have been sweating a motherfucker.
74000	76000	No, you don't have to, no one...
76000	79000	No, you gotta wear, let me make this real clear.
79000	82000	You gotta wear a suit to be the comptroller.
82000	87000	Like, I wrote five minutes of material about the suit I was planning to wear, you know?
87000	91000	Did you actually put it on and then go take this off?
91000	94000	No, I mean, I was running around finding an air conditioner all day,
94000	97000	and then I had to clean up my area to put an air conditioner into place,
97000	101000	and then by then I was sweating so hard, I was like, I can't even put on a suit, man.
101000	104000	But I still have all this great material, you know?
104000	110000	Like, oh yeah, 201st episode, Harmon, thanks for dressing up.
114000	118000	Like, it would have made sense if I was wearing a suit, that's the thing.
118000	121000	A lot of his stuff was in the pre-suit.
121000	123000	Yeah.
123000	126000	Well, I wrote down, by the way, for those of you who are new here,
126000	131000	I'm not being aloof when I'm looking, I'm not texting, I'm looking, these are my notes.
132000	138000	It's 201, so we were talking about the concept of the prestige of the video game,
138000	141000	which I've only learned through incremental clickers.
141000	145000	My favorite game currently is Cookie Collector 2.
145000	148000	You can laugh all you want, but the truth is,
148000	152000	all of you are just collecting cookies in real life.
154000	156000	Don't mock me.
156000	160000	The second one really improves on a lot of shortfalls in the first one, right?
161000	165000	Make all the obvious Cookie Collector 2 addict jokes you want.
165000	168000	There's a million of them that immediately present.
168000	171000	Every dot is within one inch of every other dot.
171000	174000	You know what's creative?
174000	177000	You know what's ironic, brave, heroic?
177000	181000	Saying, I play Cookie Collector 2 and spitting on you.
181000	183000	Sorry, sorry.
183000	186000	Saying a frothing at the mouth about...
186000	188000	I did it again.
189000	193000	Just for the people at home, for the listeners at home,
193000	198000	prestiging is when you roll over your levels to start over in a better way.
198000	201000	You're kind of reborn, you're re-borning yourself.
201000	203000	Is that a word, re-borning?
203000	205000	You're prestiging, you're starting over.
205000	207000	That's what we're doing.
207000	210000	Re-borning will definitely be the...
210000	213000	Because the Jason Bourne movie's coming out, you know, the next one.
213000	217000	Isn't this one just called, like, Jason Bourne, for real?
217000	219000	Re-born legacy.
219000	224000	Yeah, but they had to go through all the Bourne dichotomy,
224000	227000	the Bourne eulogy, the Bourne...
227000	231000	The Bourne octology.
231000	235000	But now it's like Matt Damon's back, so it's like, the Bourne!
235000	237000	Because one of them was just like Jeremy Renner,
237000	239000	it was like, the Bourne brother.
239000	240000	Yeah.
240000	242000	Bourne, Bourne-man.
242000	244000	The Bourne-man apprenticeship.
244000	247000	I'd like to be a Bourne, please.
247000	250000	Oh, Stewie.
250000	254000	No, I'm gonna be the best Bourne ever.
254000	259000	But you can't even know how many exits are in a room.
262000	267000	You can't even, like, placidly lock eyes with a beautiful international diplomat
267000	269000	and explain to her that you're so powerful,
269000	272000	you don't know why you could kick so much ass!
273000	276000	You can't do that, but I can try!
276000	279000	You know, Bourne-man...
279000	282000	I'm a little high.
282000	286000	It's not... I promise you, you're getting your money's worth.
286000	288000	So the...
288000	290000	But we're prestige-ing.
290000	294000	This is a real unprecedented moment in podcasting history.
294000	297000	Like, there's plenty of podcasts that have had 200 episodes,
297000	299000	but this isn't gonna be 201.
299000	303000	This is gonna be Harmontown Prestige episode one.
303000	304000	Right.
304000	305000	You see?
305000	306000	We're prestige-ing.
306000	307000	We're prestige-ing.
307000	311000	Typically in an incremental clicker like Cookie Collector 2.
311000	314000	Prestige-ing means that you get to start over
314000	316000	as if you're playing the game for the first time.
316000	319000	However, you have bonuses from muffins, cupcakes.
319000	322000	And in the podcast world, you get to start over
322000	325000	and delete all of your bad iTunes reviews.
325000	326000	It's all just fives.
326000	329000	In Resident Evil 1, on PlayStation 1,
329000	331000	prestige-ing was you finished all of Resident Evil
331000	334000	and you got to play it again with a rocket launcher.
334000	339000	I think that was like the original kind of prestige culture.
339000	341000	Yeah, back when it was just New Game Plus.
341000	345000	If we were prestige-ing, not to be mistaken with
345000	349000	the age-old, oh, if I could improve myself,
349000	353000	I was, be greedy, be selfish, beat the game.
353000	357000	Like, not accountable to what you think is a good person
357000	358000	or a bad person.
358000	361000	If you were going to prestige as Spencer,
361000	365000	I guess maybe relative to the podcast, so it's relatable.
365000	368000	Like, you know, like, so prestige,
368000	371000	the Spencer that is the character on Harmon Town,
371000	374000	if that character was going to prestige,
374000	378000	like, out of selfishness, what would prestige-ing involve?
378000	381000	Well, I think my position would, I'd be promoted
381000	384000	to, like, Comptroller from here on out.
384000	387000	So, like, going forward, I'd just be the co-host.
387000	389000	Yeah.
389000	392000	Would Jeff move over there or would he just, like,
392000	393000	would you just vanish?
393000	398000	He'd prestige to, like, club promoter or something.
398000	401000	I think Jeff is, like, standing in the back,
401000	404000	like, we're at Jeff's place instead of felt down.
404000	407000	Welcome to the Jeff Down Theater.
407000	410000	Jeff is just, like, happy as a can of peaches
410000	411000	giving a thumbs up from the back.
411000	412000	He comes up.
412000	413000	He's like Bud Friedman.
413000	416000	He tells people, like, not to use flash photography and stuff.
416000	421000	Yeah, oh, God, Jeff loves doing that.
421000	425000	Okay, so, here's the thing.
425000	428000	So there's a new movie out that I haven't seen yet
428000	431000	called Now You See Me 2.
431000	435000	It's a sequel to a movie...
435000	437000	Called Now You See Me.
437000	439000	Correct.
440000	443000	Well, okay, let's go there first then,
443000	447000	which is, by the way, your title,
447000	450000	the whole point of it is that it's the first part
450000	452000	of a two-part thing.
452000	455000	I guarantee you nobody that wrote that movie,
455000	457000	let alone that title, thought they were ever
457000	460000	going to be doing a sequel.
460000	463000	Can you imagine the guy coming and going, knock, knock?
463000	466000	So, apparently, there's no sarcasm checkbox
466000	472000	on Apple TV, and your movie's a hit!
472000	474000	So now they want a second one?
474000	476000	And there's, like, nine people,
476000	480000	because how could that movie be written by fewer people?
480000	484000	Have you seen that fucking movie?
484000	487000	I'm not angry. I'm excited.
487000	489000	I just watched it with Cody.
489000	491000	I was so excited that she hadn't seen it.
491000	495000	I was walking in Canada...
495000	497000	Think about it.
497000	499000	And I walked by the movie theater,
499000	501000	and on the marquee I saw the words,
501000	504000	Now You See Me 2.
504000	506000	The number two.
506000	509000	I swear to God I'm not being David Spade about this.
509000	513000	My actual fucking first instinct was,
513000	517000	Oh, that explains so much about that movie.
517000	519000	It's Canadian.
519000	522000	I'll show it here still every day,
522000	526000	and the next showing is at two.
526000	528000	I swear to Christ,
528000	531000	above that was what I thought,
531000	538000	because I expected that a sequel to that movie was that impossible.
538000	541000	Both in terms of demand and supply!
541000	543000	That movie!
543000	545000	I don't care who wants a sequel!
545000	547000	If I made that movie,
547000	549000	and people wanted a sequel,
549000	552000	I would have some explaining to do.
552000	557000	The first thing I would explain is I didn't know what I was doing.
557000	558000	And I would say,
558000	559000	Look, can we start over?
559000	561000	I have all kinds of ideas.
561000	565000	They told me magicians were cool.
565000	568000	I just got here. I'm talented.
568000	569000	You saw what I did?
569000	572000	Just let me write a different movie.
572000	573000	I don't want to...
573000	577000	I would call it Now You Don't!
577000	583000	It would be called Now You Don't!
583000	586000	In an honest world!
586000	590000	This movie was built on dishonesty about dishonesty.
590000	592000	Not only is magicians never cool,
592000	599000	magicians are cool in the context in which you can trick people into thinking they're cool,
599000	602000	and it's always a trick to think that they're cool.
602000	608000	You go down there, and it's still...
608000	610000	I forgot what I was...
610000	612000	It's a...
612000	616000	Watch Now You See Me, won.
616000	619000	Which I rewatched last night.
619000	623000	And I think, I honestly think, knock it off.
623000	626000	This movie...
626000	628000	Holy fuck, man.
628000	631000	How many people have seen Now You See Me, won?
632000	634000	Respectable.
634000	640000	Well, now that you know it doesn't matter what your vote does,
640000	644000	now that you know Trump's elected and the Now You See Me franchise into your...
644000	647000	It's like, you watching Now You See Me, won, isn't accountable.
647000	648000	Watch it.
648000	652000	I made the mistake of being one of the dollars that apparently funded the sequel.
652000	654000	I didn't mean to do that.
654000	658000	Like, they need a checkbox that says, I'm kidding!
658000	661000	I don't know, your money's green, we're gonna make a sequel.
661000	664000	We'll go ahead, but know that it's a kidding movie.
664000	667000	We were kidding when we watched the first one.
667000	669000	We were kidding!
669000	671000	Yeah, like if you could give someone a page view,
671000	675000	or you don't give someone a page view, but you're checking out like a clickbait thing,
675000	676000	that'd be great.
676000	678000	You know, the best of both worlds.
678000	679000	Yeah, just say your intention.
679000	681000	The internet's a sewer because nobody's there,
681000	683000	so if you could go into the internet,
683000	687000	and there was a lobby, and you're like, my name's Carl Johnson.
687000	688000	That'd be great.
688000	691000	And then you go, I'm gonna go talk about pedophilia now!
691000	692000	Mask.
692000	695000	And then you go through a tube, and then like, everyone's like,
695000	699000	oh, there's kidfucker29.
699000	701000	And you're like, that's me!
701000	702000	Gooba gooba!
702000	703000	I'm saying the internet needs structure.
703000	704000	That'd be great.
704000	705000	Yeah.
705000	706000	They should do that.
706000	708000	But you should always have to come back into the lobby
708000	711000	and look at yourself in a virtual mirror.
711000	712000	Before you leave the internet.
712000	713000	I'm pitching AOL.
713000	714000	Well, that's...
715000	717000	There should be a portal, and you should have a living room
717000	718000	and say, you've got mail.
718000	720000	And look at yourself.
720000	724000	You jerked off to people that look like your sister-in-law.
724000	726000	Who invited you?
726000	727000	Your mail.
727000	728000	What?
728000	731000	Just because you can talk about mail doesn't mean you're sentient.
731000	733000	You've got a lot to learn.
733000	734000	What?
734000	735000	Oh, no!
735000	737000	As long as you can say you've got before it,
737000	738000	you can say anything.
738000	740000	You've got a point.
740000	741000	No!
741000	742000	God damn it!
742000	743000	No!
743000	744000	Oh!
744000	745000	He's stabbing me!
747000	748000	That'd be great.
750000	753000	So have you seen the trailer for this new Now You've Done It?
753000	754000	No, no.
754000	755000	What is it?
755000	756000	Now You've Done It.
756000	757000	That would be a great...
757000	758000	Now You've...
758000	760000	What if they did a sequel, and the sequel was...
760000	761000	They were like, okay, what is it?
761000	762000	Now You Two Me?
762000	764000	Now You See Me Two?
764000	765000	Now You Don't?
765000	766000	What is it going to be?
766000	767000	But it was just like...
767000	769000	They were like, now you pee.
770000	771000	And that was it.
771000	772000	It was like Cloverfield Lane.
772000	774000	They were just like, it's not a sequel.
774000	775000	It's just a fucking...
775000	776000	Now You pee.
776000	778000	It's from the Now You series.
779000	780000	You don't think we know how to make movies?
780000	782000	Fucking step off.
782000	783000	Let the people in.
783000	785000	They're trying to get in to see a good movie, motherfucker.
785000	787000	You fucking jaded piece of shit.
787000	790000	Fucking Now You is in session.
790000	794000	Now You Surf against a shark monster.
795000	798000	Hey, did you see the most recent Now You movie?
799000	800000	Now You...
800000	804000	No, I fucking love Now You See Me One.
804000	806000	Yeah, I love Now You Diamond Heist.
807000	810000	Did you see Now You Reunion?
810000	812000	A Wish Upon a Star?
812000	813000	Sweet!
813000	815000	No, it was sweet!
815000	817000	I loved Oh Now You Didn't.
818000	820000	Yeah, well, there's a lawsuit pending.
820000	824000	Those people actually don't represent the Now You franchise.
824000	825000	No, but I mean that trailer.
825000	827000	And they're playing the race card and it's not cool.
827000	833000	The trailer's problematic, though, because, like, yeah, you know, it's a wizard movie about all these wizards and sorcerers, you know?
833000	838000	And they're like, you know, you got Mark Zuckerberg and he, like, conjures a storm of cards.
838000	844000	And then you have, like, I don't know, Morgan Freeman, and he, like, picks a card and puts it through a guy's skull and stuff.
844000	848000	And then you got a guy who disappears and reappears inside of a bank fall.
848000	852000	And then you got Lizzie Kaplan, who takes her bra off without taking off her top.
852000	853000	That's the first one, too!
853000	854000	Isla Fisher plays it.
854000	860000	I go, like, Cody, you're going to be introduced to the five types of magician now.
860000	861000	Yeah.
861000	873000	From the Criss Angel type, played by Jesse Eisenberg, to the spoon-bending pickpocket car-chasing type, played by one of the Franco's.
874000	877000	Then Woody Harrelson is a, he's a mentalist.
877000	882000	And that is what Isla Fisher, she's introduced to her, go, like, and here comes the lady magician.
882000	885000	And the writers were like, fuck.
885000	887000	Like, David Copperfield?
887000	889000	Like, he's a guy!
889000	892000	She's a lady magician, but she's awesome.
893000	896000	Lady magician, I just, I...
897000	900000	Often times a lady is a magician's assistant.
902000	903000	Tom?
903000	905000	Giant Tom?
906000	912000	Are you sitting in the corner, like, talking in a slightly urban petois?
913000	915000	That's right.
915000	918000	Just watching y'all try to figure out this story.
918000	921000	Seems to me, magicians come with femininity.
921000	927000	It's just compartmentalized in the form of their subjectifiable, objectifiable assistant.
928000	929000	Tom?
930000	931000	He's right.
931000	935000	Isla Fisher should play a new kind of magician.
935000	938000	She used to be Zuckerberg's assistant.
938000	945000	Now she takes off her clothes before dropping into a tank of water.
946000	949000	She's like, I'm super assistant.
949000	950000	All right.
950000	953000	Anyway, that's not my beef with the, I'm not, I'm not white knighting.
953000	955000	It's an insane movie.
955000	956000	You should watch this movie.
956000	958000	Now you watch it.
958000	962000	Now you fucking, like, you're mind blown.
962000	965000	I shouldn't have, I spent too much time talking about it.
966000	968000	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
968000	971000	Look, there's lots of stuff to talk about.
971000	980000	I want to tell you about me handling myself pretty well against a terrible person in a bar.
980000	982000	Oh, yeah.
982000	983000	Oh, yeah.
986000	990000	So it's a good time to bring out my friend Dino Stamatopoulos.
990000	992000	Let's bring out Dino.
993000	994000	Oh, shit.
1000000	1001000	Hi.
1002000	1003000	Yeah.
1003000	1006000	And now that Dino's here, remind me to talk about my new condom idea.
1006000	1008000	It's going to blow minds.
1008000	1009000	Why?
1009000	1010000	Why me?
1010000	1011000	Because, you know.
1011000	1012000	Because I'm a pervert.
1012000	1014000	You're my angel investor.
1016000	1018000	What's your condom idea, Spencer?
1018000	1020000	Okay, so think about condoms.
1020000	1024000	Now forget everything you ever knew about condoms.
1024000	1025000	No, okay.
1025000	1029000	Okay, remember a couple of things about condoms.
1030000	1031000	That's my first problem.
1031000	1033000	I never remember condoms.
1033000	1034000	Right.
1034000	1036000	Well, this one you'll never forget.
1036000	1041000	So, I mean, essentially a condom is a sock, you know?
1041000	1043000	Who makes your sock?
1043000	1045000	You stuff it, you stuff it on the end of it.
1045000	1048000	See, my first thought was, how big is your dick?
1051000	1053000	You thought he had weird socks.
1053000	1055000	I thought he had an enormous hinged dick.
1057000	1058000	Dicks are very important to you.
1058000	1060000	Feet are important to me, you know?
1060000	1062000	But so, okay, right.
1062000	1063000	It's like a sock.
1063000	1067000	The only thing that's keeping it on is like friction and like...
1067000	1068000	Elasticity.
1068000	1070000	Elasticity, yeah.
1070000	1074000	So, but then to do that, it has to be shoved all the way down the leg that you shoved.
1074000	1080000	Okay, so imagine, if you will, a shortened condom that's more like a head cap, right?
1080000	1084000	And then at the end is a rubber band that goes behind your balls.
1085000	1089000	So, most of your shaft still has that exposure.
1089000	1090000	It's not covered.
1090000	1098000	But the tension of this rubber band pulling your balls towards the front, that keeps it on.
1098000	1099000	I love it.
1099000	1100000	I do that anyway.
1105000	1107000	It's fucking nothing like a nice, tight set of balls.
1107000	1109000	That's why I wanted you out here.
1109000	1110000	Boing!
1110000	1111000	Yeah, man.
1111000	1113000	It's like a cock ring and a condom.
1113000	1120000	I'm trying to imagine, I think my answer, my answer, I'm sure it's different for you,
1120000	1125000	is that depending on the excitement level of the woman and my age,
1125000	1128000	I have a hard enough time getting this little fucker anywhere.
1128000	1131000	Yeah, but it would be tailored made to your balls.
1131000	1132000	There's things on it.
1132000	1135000	Anything that's on it is going to fall off eventually.
1135000	1136000	No, but it would wrap around.
1136000	1137000	Did you ever have a cock ring on?
1137000	1138000	Yeah, exactly.
1138000	1140000	No, I've never had a cock ring on.
1140000	1142000	I'm not saying that proudly.
1142000	1143000	I don't mean that.
1143000	1145000	I mean, I'm self-shaming.
1145000	1147000	I do not have that honor, sir.
1147000	1151000	You should, because apparently you and your girlfriend love your balls.
1151000	1153000	Well, we just found that out.
1153000	1156000	Yeah, and this would help.
1156000	1161000	I mean, your balls would be like fucking Dolly Parton balls with the cock ring on.
1161000	1162000	I don't want to change the shit.
1162000	1163000	I'm very old. I'm 51.
1163000	1164000	It's like a bar portion.
1164000	1167000	I don't want to put anything in my dick that changes the size of my balls.
1167000	1169000	Oh, because it makes your dick look smaller?
1169000	1174000	No, because the only way that happens in cartoons is when there's buildup.
1174000	1175000	Well, the buildup is great.
1175000	1178000	You're talking about like Tom and Jerry, and he puts his foot on his hose.
1178000	1179000	What episode is that?
1179000	1180000	Oh.
1180000	1181000	A hose.
1181000	1184000	I don't want to do anything like that to my mind.
1184000	1186000	This is the right neighborhood.
1186000	1190000	You could go like five feet in any direction and find some good cock rings.
1191000	1196000	I wasn't implying that I couldn't find good cock rings.
1196000	1198000	I'm just saying I think you would love them.
1198000	1199000	No.
1199000	1200000	Well, I don't think I would.
1200000	1201000	I think you would.
1201000	1202000	You'd love them.
1202000	1204000	But what do they do?
1204000	1205000	They keep you hard?
1205000	1206000	Yeah, they keep you hard.
1206000	1207000	Why would you want...
1207000	1208000	They're fine.
1208000	1210000	You don't want to stay hard?
1210000	1211000	You're stylish?
1211000	1215000	Well, isn't it kind of like...
1215000	1221000	Well, it's like my therapist says that...
1221000	1223000	You shouldn't stay hard.
1223000	1230000	No, my therapist says sex is a destination, not an event.
1230000	1232000	Fuck your therapist.
1232000	1233000	It's an event.
1233000	1234000	What?
1234000	1235000	It's the best thing ever.
1235000	1237000	What does that distinction mean?
1237000	1242000	It means that you're joining with someone and going somewhere together.
1242000	1244000	Well, then isn't it a journey?
1245000	1246000	And not a destination?
1246000	1247000	Yeah, no.
1247000	1252000	The same thing happened when I said it's because of the...
1252000	1253000	It's not the destination.
1253000	1254000	It's the journey.
1254000	1255000	But that's basically...
1255000	1258000	That's what these people are saying.
1258000	1263000	But you can't apply that to sex and say it's not the sex destination.
1263000	1265000	It's the sex journey.
1265000	1267000	They've already heard that.
1267000	1273000	It's more powerful to say sex isn't the thing that starts to happen and then at some point stops happening.
1273000	1278000	It's not like a thing that you need to accomplish because that starts to set into a syndrome.
1278000	1280000	So what's good about it then?
1280000	1281000	What's good about what?
1281000	1282000	Sex.
1282000	1283000	Sex isn't...
1283000	1284000	Because it feels good.
1284000	1287000	Oh, so it's all about blowing your load on someone.
1287000	1291000	But don't make that the goal or you may never.
1291000	1292000	Well, then what is the goal?
1292000	1294000	To have fun and give you...
1294000	1295000	Yeah.
1295000	1297000	It often involves blowing your load on people.
1297000	1298000	All right, I like that.
1299000	1302000	I'm not making my therapist's point.
1302000	1306000	All it is is to say just take the pressure off.
1306000	1315000	Because this idea that it's possible to have sexual dysfunction, sexual pressure, things that are happening,
1315000	1318000	you're like, oh, it's...
1318000	1319000	Right, I know.
1319000	1321000	It's the pressure that keeps me going though.
1321000	1324000	Yeah, you can have a relationship with it.
1324000	1325000	I love having a bad time along the way.
1325000	1327000	You can be like, she doesn't think I'm going to get hard on it.
1327000	1332000	I'm going to show her that my screenplay is going to be great.
1332000	1334000	You can have it like a... if it works.
1334000	1337000	I've never written a screenplay.
1337000	1338000	All right, so...
1338000	1339000	All right, now you see me too.
1339000	1341000	Oh, I brought you out here because...
1341000	1342000	Right.
1342000	1343000	All right, so...
1343000	1344000	Our bar night.
1344000	1345000	Our bar day.
1345000	1346000	Oh, yeah.
1346000	1353000	This segment is called Dan Harmon Does It Mostly Right.
1353000	1354000	It's a bad title.
1354000	1356000	Do you have music for it?
1356000	1367000	Most of my stories are about what a failure I am.
1367000	1375000	It wouldn't be comp trolling if I wasn't just messing stuff up over here.
1375000	1376000	See?
1376000	1377000	Okay.
1377000	1378000	All right.
1378000	1381000	Anyways, but this is, you know...
1382000	1385000	Like when Jeff Davis tells a story, it's like we celebrated.
1385000	1390000	He goes, like, I went and got a brownie yesterday at Brownie's store.
1390000	1391000	Did you hear about this prize?
1391000	1392000	I got 12 blowjobs.
1392000	1393000	Everyone loved me.
1393000	1397000	I went in and I looked at the brownies and said, there's like nine kinds of brownie.
1397000	1401000	And I said, do you have a chocolate extreme?
1401000	1403000	So I'm fucking the chocolate extreme.
1403000	1404000	A chocolate extreme.
1404000	1406000	And I mean fucking the chocolate extreme.
1406000	1410000	Yeah, and the story ends with somebody invariably, as we've pointed out...
1410000	1411000	Grabbing his arm.
1411000	1419000	Someone in the service industry, or a rock band, grabbing Jeff on the arm and saying,
1419000	1421000	thank you.
1421000	1422000	So look for that.
1422000	1424000	Thank you for wanting that.
1424000	1426000	Thank you for ordering that.
1426000	1429000	Who ordered the frillama mama?
1429000	1431000	Thank you.
1433000	1434000	Where were we?
1434000	1437000	Just, we didn't even start the bar.
1437000	1438000	Oh, okay.
1438000	1444000	So anyways, my stories usually end with me shitting my pants and being a bad person.
1444000	1449000	I think this story, I'm kind of a badass and an amazing person.
1449000	1451000	Oh, don't give it away, but yeah, maybe.
1451000	1452000	We'll see.
1452000	1453000	We'll all be the judge.
1453000	1454000	All right.
1454000	1456000	So I just wanted to witness here.
1456000	1462000	We went into a bar, and there was nobody in it but one guy.
1462000	1463000	And the bartender.
1463000	1464000	And the bartender.
1464000	1465000	Yeah.
1465000	1470000	So we walked in, and it was dark and quiet.
1470000	1474000	And there was nice music playing on either the jukebox or what have you.
1474000	1478000	But in any case, there was baseball on the TV.
1478000	1481000	And there was one guy sitting there.
1481000	1483000	So, and then...
1483000	1485000	And the baseball was, you know, the volume was on.
1485000	1486000	It was blaring.
1486000	1489000	I sat in the stools with Dino, the middle thing.
1489000	1490000	Bar is empty.
1490000	1491000	Okay, great.
1491000	1492000	Not thinking about anything.
1492000	1494000	That guy gets up and he leaves.
1494000	1495000	There's some money on the bar.
1495000	1496000	There's a drink on the bar.
1496000	1499000	I'm not sure if he's left or not.
1499000	1507000	I say to the bartender, hey, do you know if that guy is invested in the audio of the
1507000	1509000	baseball broadcast?
1509000	1510000	Does he...
1510000	1511000	What?
1511000	1518000	I don't want to...
1518000	1521000	Does he need to hear the baseball?
1521000	1523000	Because I would love to...
1523000	1525000	You want me to mute the baseball?
1525000	1526000	Yeah.
1526000	1527000	I don't want to be an asshole.
1527000	1528000	Well, no.
1528000	1535000	I want you to mute the baseball if that guy, unless that guy loves the baseball sounds.
1535000	1538000	I think he left.
1538000	1539000	I'm going to repeat that.
1539000	1542000	I think he left because it's kind of an important thing.
1542000	1547000	At this point, I'm thinking Dan's over explaining it, but this guy's still not getting it.
1548000	1552000	I don't mean to throw you under the bus, but you're making fun of me a little bit.
1552000	1555000	You're going like, you're over fucking doing it.
1555000	1556000	Yeah, I got it.
1556000	1557000	Just ask him to turn it down.
1557000	1561000	I'm like, okay, I'm going to compartmentalize that shame because it keeps me from violence
1561000	1568000	and you'll understand sooner or later.
1568000	1575000	I just wanted this guy to understand that definitely do not mistake this for me being entitled
1575000	1581000	to fucking control over the sensory environment of this bar.
1581000	1584000	Yeah, you're going beyond the call of duty.
1584000	1591000	I think he left and I was like, then my blue sky would be no baseball audio.
1591000	1593000	He's not embellishing this, by the way.
1593000	1596000	And just this.
1596000	1598000	He's like, can do whatever.
1598000	1606000	It's a baseball, goes on mute, music comes up, and we experience for four minutes and 17 seconds.
1606000	1612000	The version of life I still feel entitled to somehow.
1612000	1616000	Yeah, when there's no one else in the bar, we should just listen to the music and we don't have to.
1616000	1621000	Just being, I'm talking about work with Dino.
1621000	1628000	And so at some point during that, all of a sudden, then I was like, what, did you box into this thing?
1628000	1636000	All of a sudden you're kind of conscious of the fact that the baseball audio is back up.
1636000	1638000	Yeah, you noticed this. I didn't.
1638000	1641000	And I'm like, I get peeved at a certain point.
1641000	1642000	The guy never came back.
1642000	1644000	The other guy, he was gone.
1644000	1646000	So it's me, Dino, and the bartender.
1646000	1652000	The bartender is seated three feet from the TV at the end of the bar and he's watching it.
1652000	1658000	Now he's watching it with audio, which has changed since that weird labyrinthine conversation.
1658000	1668000	The headline of which I'd like to define as this motherfucker, Dan Harmon, gives massive shits about the people around him
1668000	1675000	to the point where he doesn't want to make a fucking move until he's got the all clear.
1675000	1680000	And so this guy is like, what is going on? Why is he watching? He knew.
1680000	1691000	And I'm just, so the thing in my head is I go, geez, this guy, he was really ashamed of loving baseball audio.
1691000	1694000	But he's gone. He's gone. He's gone in the back room at this point, right?
1694000	1696000	Yeah, he goes in the back room for a second.
1696000	1698000	And Dan starts talking to me about this guy.
1698000	1704000	And I'm like, this is fascinating to me because this guy, like, he says, I'm asking,
1704000	1707000	I remember that laborious conversation we had. Yeah, yeah.
1707000	1714000	Don't you think there was like a million chances for him to say, well, I'll tell you what.
1714000	1721000	I work here and I know you think the laws of economy should apply.
1721000	1723000	That's all convenient for you.
1723000	1728000	But the truth is, this is my corner of the world, and I love baseball.
1728000	1736000	And that there's the most important game that's ever been played specifically because the players make strange sounds
1736000	1738000	and the or the sportscaster.
1738000	1744000	Howard Coselles come out of the grave and he's like doing this one. I need to hear the fucking sounds.
1744000	1748000	I say any of that. And then I would go, well, that's good information.
1748000	1752000	I'm glad we now know we can go to a different bar.
1752000	1756000	So I was sitting there resenting. I was going like, well, see that guy come on. Come on.
1756000	1760000	I mean, like, well, we have that whole conversation. He's like, and then he comes back out.
1760000	1765000	And then I'm hearing him bitch about this. And but I haven't noticed that the baseball's up.
1765000	1769000	So I'm like, so he just thinks I'm nuts. Yeah. Why are you bringing this up again?
1769000	1774000	So I just I was tuning it out. Yeah. And then I perceive it. I'm like, why is it?
1774000	1779000	Okay. All right. So and then the guy is like sitting there and it's like Dino keeps talking and I'm like,
1779000	1783000	and now I'm just like, I can't hear anything but the fucking TV.
1783000	1789000	And so I do this weird thing like a six year old would do.
1789000	1796000	I'm still lost. And Dino doesn't know why I'm doing this, but I'm like staring at my Amstel bottle
1796000	1807000	and I just lock eyes with the Amstel bottle and I just start to do my impression of the sounds coming from the TV.
1807000	1815000	Really, really loudly. Well, not I mean, really loudly, meaning I was matching the I wanted to simulate.
1815000	1825000	Well, if that should be in the bar, then then if that would that was in a chair over here, then that's this is what that would sound like.
1825000	1828000	And so I was just like strength and the Johnson.
1828000	1833000	We're going for a thing. Oh, that's going to be fun. And yeah, I said, oh, oh, it's a great night for sports.
1833000	1838000	A major league. So the dichotomy. You saw, well, Stan Johnson, whoa, three yards.
1838000	1842000	He woke up with him opening a heart. And it doesn't even end there.
1842000	1848000	Then there's like a like a like a Arby's commercial like our Arby's Arby's commercial comes on.
1848000	1854000	It's like, by the way, sports don't mean joy. Sports means every four minutes.
1854000	1857000	You've got seven minutes of corporate fucking propaganda.
1857000	1866000	Don't tell me you can hang out in a bar and keep to your fucking ideological guns and you're bathing yourself and Jerry Springer and Carl's Junior commercials.
1866000	1870000	Fuck you. You're not punk rock. Kill yourself.
1870000	1875000	But it's a fucking commercial. It's like sports commercials are worse than sports.
1875000	1878000	Why do you even watch them? So I just started out like Carl's Junior.
1878000	1882000	Oh, it's going to be a hot tub. Your town's a catch up.
1882000	1886000	So at this point, it dawns on me what's going on. I'm like, oh, it's an empty bar.
1886000	1897000	It's me and a guy staring at a television whose job is to bring us drinks and who I have made a pact with that the baseball audio would be silent.
1897000	1903000	So it's now blaring it. And I'm doing the opposite. And Dino's going, what's going on? What's happening?
1903000	1907000	And so I finally got to go like, oh, it's a mustard catch up.
1908000	1913000	Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. What the fuck am I listening to? I'm in a bar.
1913000	1918000	And I said that and like fucking it wasn't.
1918000	1924000	I want you to understand, like if you were editing this in in iMovie, you would not.
1924000	1928000	There wouldn't be any space between those lines of dialogue waiting.
1928000	1932000	Like it's like when you're really, really mad at somebody and you're really ready to go.
1933000	1937000	I want to make it clear, like that's how dramatic that was.
1937000	1940000	It's like I said, what the fuck am I? I said, I'm going to fucking bar.
1940000	1942000	What the fuck am I listening to?
1942000	1946000	Which was my height of shame because I was like throwing this little tantrum doing this thing.
1946000	1950000	And so I was kind of like, that was me pulling a ripcord. Like I wasn't going to do anymore.
1950000	1952000	I don't know who knows what I would have done.
1952000	1955000	But I was being a baby and I was feeling like a baby.
1955000	1959000	And like at the height of me doing that, though, the crazy thing.
1959000	1963000	I go, I go, what the fuck am I listening to? What the fuck am I listening to?
1963000	1964000	Silence.
1964000	1968000	Look over at this six foot five beefy arm to fucking bespectacled.
1968000	1974000	But in a way that makes you think maybe he just needs murder vision.
1974000	1979000	Like not a guy you not if he was a bouncer, I would not question it.
1979000	1984000	Like I'd been intimidated by everybody, but definitely could have killed me.
1984000	1988000	And he was like, what am I listening to?
1988000	1992000	We look at him and he goes like, fucking talk about this bullshit.
1992000	1999000	You fucking talk about your Netflix deal and fucking industry hack.
1999000	2001000	This guy.
2001000	2007000	This guy had an axe to grind.
2007000	2013000	How can you have that much backstory and be watching broadcast cable?
2013000	2016000	That guy needs to be a Blu-ray collector.
2016000	2018000	Like he's fucking rich as a character.
2018000	2020000	I was like, industry hack?
2020000	2023000	And he goes, yeah, you come in here talking about your deals.
2023000	2024000	You got this deal and that deal.
2024000	2028000	And I was like, oh, laughing.
2028000	2032000	And I'm not proud of that, but I just started like I was like, because I was like,
2032000	2034000	like the guy was like, I felt bullied.
2034000	2037000	And so now it's easy to like, I'm now I'm the bully.
2037000	2039000	But it's like I didn't feel that way.
2039000	2040000	I felt like an underdog.
2040000	2042000	So I was like, oh, man.
2042000	2043000	Wow.
2043000	2046000	And silence, empty bar.
2046000	2052000	And then I said, am I going to repeat it or are you?
2052000	2053000	Maybe if you do it.
2053000	2056000	I got to think of what it was exactly.
2056000	2057000	Is there a bat in here?
2057000	2058000	Hey, you hit it.
2058000	2060000	Sorry, is there a Buddhist around?
2060000	2066000	I said, man, the time and energy it takes to make you honest.
2066000	2069000	Right, yeah.
2069000	2071000	And all he did was look down.
2071000	2072000	He didn't say another word.
2072000	2076000	And we got up and we fucking put down our sarcastic tips.
2076000	2077000	He tipped him like $30.
2077000	2080000	And I drank and I did.
2080000	2081000	I did.
2081000	2085000	I think I feel like Jeff Davis would do, which is I sat there and I planted my feet
2085000	2087000	and I drank to the bottom of the glass.
2087000	2090000	And then I went.
2090000	2091000	Put the glass in the bar.
2091000	2092000	I walked out.
2092000	2094000	I felt like Jeff was on my shoulder going like.
2094000	2095000	No, it was beautiful.
2095000	2097000	And fucking let that fort sit there.
2097000	2098000	Don't say anything.
2098000	2099000	Don't say it.
2099000	2100000	Yeah.
2100000	2101000	He said the perfect amount.
2101000	2103000	It was perfect.
2103000	2104000	Anyways.
2104000	2105000	Bullies.
2105000	2107000	Am I right, people?
2107000	2110000	I'm kind of on that guy's side.
2110000	2113000	On the bartender's side, you know.
2113000	2114000	You are on the bartender's side?
2114000	2118000	Have you ever heard fucking LA people talk about their fucking bullshit?
2118000	2120000	It's the worst experience imaginable.
2120000	2121000	Yeah, but here's the thing.
2121000	2122000	Here's the thing.
2122000	2123000	We asked them to turn the music up.
2123000	2126000	We didn't ask them to just turn the sound down.
2126000	2127000	We said we want to hear the music.
2127000	2128000	Yeah.
2128000	2131000	Also, by the way, if you have the word hack in your vocabulary and you're a
2131000	2134000	bartender, you better be the best fucking bartender in the world.
2134000	2140000	And that includes not judging the fucking racist, sexist, rapist, fucking.
2140000	2141000	Yeah.
2141000	2144000	The occasional industrial hack that comes through your bar.
2144000	2148000	The reason why the bar is sacred is because you're supposed to be not
2148000	2151000	impartial, but you're supposed to keep your fucking lips zipped.
2151000	2156000	And you're supposed to be an objective, strange, like crooked lighthouse
2156000	2161000	to the broken, you know, like, like, like, I don't demand that of anybody,
2161000	2162000	but don't demand.
2162000	2163000	I don't mention Netflix on my fucking.
2163000	2167000	I'm working on the weekend.
2167000	2169000	The industry hack.
2169000	2170000	Yeah.
2170000	2171000	Fine.
2171000	2176000	I'll be the first person to call myself that if you're cool to me.
2176000	2180000	Fucking guy loves baseball so much.
2180000	2181000	Do we change your mind?
2181000	2183000	No, no.
2183000	2184000	I mean.
2184000	2185000	But what are you saying, Spencer?
2185000	2186000	Are you saying that you what?
2186000	2189000	Saying you should reexamine your life.
2189000	2192000	But are you, but are you saying that if you were that bartender, that you
2192000	2194000	would have turned on the baseball audio?
2194000	2198000	No, I'm just saying if, if I were that guy and I turned up the baseball
2198000	2202000	art audio and then I heard someone making fun of me, I'd be kind of upset.
2202000	2203000	I wasn't making fun of him.
2203000	2206000	I was.
2206000	2207000	Oh, oh, oh, hey.
2207000	2208000	Okay.
2208000	2209000	Yeah, exactly.
2209000	2211000	No, I wanted the guy to go, Hey, fuck you.
2211000	2216000	It's kind of weird that when he finally popped the wine on top of the
2216000	2221000	bottle had nothing to do with me being loud, obnoxious, nerdy, like totally
2221000	2222000	out of line.
2222000	2225000	Weirdly, it had to do with my Netflix deal.
2225000	2226000	Yeah.
2226000	2229000	Because again, the kinds of douche bags that talk about that stuff are
2229000	2230000	insufferable.
2230000	2233000	He probably has to put up with shit like that from actual.
2233000	2234000	Oh my God.
2234000	2237000	The smallest violin for the L.A.
2237000	2240000	bartender.
2240000	2246000	So sick of serving drinks to people in the entertainment industry.
2246000	2250000	My heart fucking bleeds.
2250000	2251000	Give me a drink.
2251000	2253000	I need it to work.
2253000	2257000	I have 70 jobs.
2257000	2260000	That guy, that guy would be in Ireland just screaming like, quit talking
2260000	2263000	about coal mining fucking fat.
2263000	2266000	You fucking hack, you fucking pickaxe.
2266000	2267000	Deal with it.
2267000	2268000	You're in L.A.
2268000	2269000	This is what we talk about.
2269000	2273000	I'm going to be dead at 61 if I'm lucky.
2273000	2276000	Paying that guy's salary with my Sunday.
2276000	2278000	I was working.
2278000	2281000	I don't even want to talk about the industry.
2281000	2282000	I'm working.
2282000	2284000	I usually like Spencer.
2284000	2285000	Hey, man.
2285000	2289000	Well, I got to say this rant against blue collar people has really turned me
2289000	2291000	around on your side.
2292000	2295000	It's not a rant against blue collar people.
2295000	2298000	How dare you be upset with your douche bag.
2298000	2302000	My rant is about allowing the term blue collar to be applied to people.
2302000	2306000	That guy didn't lift shit during his fucking tirade.
2306000	2307000	He was dishonest.
2307000	2311000	He turned that baseball up in a passive aggressive way.
2311000	2314000	I think you guys both just glanced off each other at the wrong way
2314000	2316000	and then you both got mad.
2316000	2317000	Yeah.
2317000	2318000	No, I admit that.
2318000	2322000	You look like Jesus Christ.
2322000	2327000	I admit that, but I still think I'm the hero of that story.
2327000	2331000	But it doesn't matter because my next topic is, and here comes a segment called
2331000	2336000	Things You'll Never Hear Talked About on Any Other Podcast,
2336000	2339000	colon Donald Trump edition.
2341000	2344000	Today there's a fascist openly running for president
2344000	2348000	and the world is ending and it's affecting us in different ways.
2348000	2351000	Remember in high school you studied literature
2351000	2354000	and you learned that the invention of the atomic bomb or World War I
2354000	2356000	totally affected like 30 years of literature,
2356000	2358000	which means it is possible for the national psyche to be affected
2358000	2361000	by huge catastrophic events.
2361000	2365000	And it's seeping into us, but I found the silver lining of it.
2365000	2369000	I'm coming through for better or for worse.
2370000	2376000	The Donald Trump phenomenon is now, it's bringing me through,
2376000	2379000	it's releasing me from my need for approval.
2379000	2381000	It's separating.
2381000	2383000	It's doing that for a lot of people.
2383000	2387000	Mostly white supremacists, but a lot of people.
2387000	2390000	Well, absolutely correct.
2390000	2393000	But hopefully for me that's a better thing
2393000	2395000	than if a skinhead feels that way.
2395000	2397000	But that is exactly what's happening.
2397000	2400000	People are uncorked, but it's like how much of you is performance
2400000	2404000	and how much of you is intent and behavior,
2404000	2407000	those two things being unbraided because it's like,
2407000	2414000	hey, there was a time when I was obsessed with the fact that like,
2414000	2417000	oh, what's this politically correct phenomenon going on?
2417000	2420000	Do you mean if you never say something racist,
2420000	2422000	that means you're a flawless person
2422000	2425000	because this president has never said anything racist
2425000	2427000	and he's a terrible, terrible person.
2427000	2429000	He's doing terrible things that cost human lives.
2429000	2431000	That was my whole game.
2431000	2433000	And then you go into the new generation where it becomes,
2433000	2437000	but now the weird thing is this guy is like,
2437000	2442000	I mean, he's as famous as you can ever get ever.
2442000	2447000	He's as close to whatever fucking definition we have
2447000	2451000	of winning the American game is.
2451000	2454000	Like we've, as far as we've defined it,
2454000	2458000	he, and he just keeps, and so it's like,
2458000	2461000	there's a point where I hit this bottom,
2461000	2463000	thank God we didn't have a podcast last week
2463000	2465000	because I think I was kind of feeling this way then,
2465000	2467000	was like, how am I supposed to,
2467000	2471000	why am I even fucking trying to be a good person?
2471000	2474000	What is, I almost tweeted it,
2474000	2476000	like this is the danger that this guy represents,
2476000	2478000	that there's going to be like,
2478000	2481000	because on the lower class level that takes the form
2481000	2485000	of fucking clockwork orange gangs running through the street
2485000	2491000	going like, hey, Mexie, I tabby-tab, you're racey-race.
2491000	2495000	It's baby talky, so it's weird-weird.
2495000	2498000	But honestly, you're black and I'm stomping on you.
2498000	2501000	And that up the upper class is that there would be
2501000	2503000	a similar thing, it would take the form,
2503000	2505000	and then somewhere in the middle was me going like,
2505000	2507000	oh fuck, I don't have a conscience anymore.
2507000	2512000	But that led to, oh shit, but okay.
2512000	2518000	No, what that means is you have to stop basing it on outcome.
2518000	2521000	You have to stop basing it on opinion,
2521000	2528000	on whether or not it is going to make people like you or hate you
2528000	2532000	because that doesn't matter and that's a good thing to learn
2532000	2536000	because that actually means that you could like,
2536000	2540000	I think a lot of us want to say things that we're worried about.
2540000	2541000	No, I'm not.
2541000	2542000	I'm so hot.
2542000	2545000	I thought if I dug through the tunnel I would eventually hit a hand.
2545000	2548000	Does anyone want any ice?
2548000	2549000	Woo!
2549000	2551000	Oh, wow.
2551000	2552000	Oh!
2552000	2554000	It's a big one.
2554000	2557000	Oh, God.
2557000	2561000	Oh, boy.
2561000	2564000	You guys are in the splash zone.
2565000	2568000	That was a success and it just got alcohol over the floor.
2568000	2571000	That's what a success is.
2571000	2573000	What were you trying to rant at?
2573000	2574000	I couldn't listen.
2574000	2577000	The only thing I could think you were getting at is
2577000	2580000	political correctness can cause problems
2580000	2584000	because if people that are only a little racist are like,
2584000	2588000	if I'm going to be treated like I'm a Nazi every time I say something kind of off-color,
2588000	2590000	then what's the point of even trying?
2590000	2592000	Why don't I just go whole hog the other way?
2592000	2595000	Because if we kind of approach with sensitivity and be all like,
2595000	2598000	hey, man, I get what you're saying, I'm not trying to attack you,
2598000	2601000	but the end result of what you're saying can lead down this path
2601000	2602000	and that's why it might be good.
2602000	2603000	Right.
2603000	2606000	If the enemy is ignorance, for instance,
2606000	2613000	then the way to defeat ignorance is not to hit it on the head with a brick, necessarily.
2613000	2616000	I read this crazy article about a guy...
2616000	2617000	This is getting me horny.
2617000	2619000	Are you rubbing ice on your junk?
2619000	2620000	Yeah.
2621000	2624000	That doesn't even sound unpleasant enough to get you horny.
2628000	2630000	It just sounds a bit uncomfortable.
2630000	2633000	Look, I just had nothing to say.
2633000	2636000	I mean, I think you really used what you had.
2636000	2637000	That's all I got.
2637000	2638000	You got a resource in this.
2638000	2642000	That kind of led me into, okay, so I'm forcing a dot connect here,
2642000	2645000	but it does exist anyway,
2645000	2649000	which is another topical, horrible, weird, random thing
2649000	2656000	since just random chaos was that actor today that died in that crazy way
2656000	2659000	and everybody just wanted to know what the hell is going on
2659000	2663000	and it was kind of like a great metaphorical...
2663000	2668000	It was like when people get sick and we associate that with death and stuff,
2668000	2673000	there's not enough lightning strikes and crazy things to really cast death
2673000	2675000	and it's direct.
2675000	2677000	The way that people dealt with it and watching it,
2677000	2682000	I had to go to the TMZ article about this death
2682000	2686000	and then just the comment section,
2686000	2690000	just Star Trek pun after Star Trek pun after Star Trek pun
2690000	2694000	and kind of mean as if...
2694000	2698000	You can tell that the joke is like,
2698000	2701000	I'm not here to generate humor.
2701000	2705000	I'm here as a punchline to this crazy setup that exists
2705000	2709000	called fucked up society that's so fucking...
2709000	2711000	I respect that.
2711000	2715000	That's always going to be needed if society is truly fucked up
2715000	2718000	but everybody wants to be that guy,
2718000	2720000	but going through that thing and I was like,
2720000	2725000	holy shit, man, there's literally almost nobody saying like,
2725000	2727000	what a bummer.
2727000	2729000	Of course, you wouldn't log in to say that.
2729000	2732000	Then you go like, okay, so the internet is...
2732000	2734000	It's like this carnival.
2734000	2736000	There's none of those people.
2736000	2738000	Everyone just...
2738000	2741000	You go into this toilet and you put on these weird bird masks
2741000	2743000	and you do this fucked up shit.
2743000	2747000	It's like the Purge series,
2747000	2748000	which I think everybody...
2748000	2750000	It's not because those movies are good that they keep making them.
2750000	2751000	I think everyone's like,
2751000	2758000	tell me more about that absolute thinly veiled metaphor for my life.
2759000	2769000	That plus Trump equals not nihilism.
2769000	2776000	It equals renewed realization that being cool absolutely
2776000	2778000	can only be by your own definitions.
2778000	2782000	The other ones don't work at all for anyone.
2783000	2789000	You better make every day of achieving that goal
2789000	2791000	worth as much as the final one
2791000	2796000	because a bus might fall out of the sky and land on the building you're in.
2796000	2797000	That's crazy.
2797000	2800000	First of all, the way that guy died,
2800000	2804000	as if there's not enough ways that I'm afraid of dying.
2804000	2808000	You're driving home, you're like, oh, yeah, you can get hit.
2808000	2813000	You feel like when you park your car, you're done.
2813000	2814000	Made it safe.
2814000	2819000	Now this guy got hit by a parked car.
2819000	2821000	It's like a nightmare.
2821000	2823000	What happened?
2823000	2825000	Well, he thought it was parked.
2825000	2827000	It sounded like...
2827000	2830000	He thought he put it in park, but he put it neutral, right?
2830000	2833000	What it sounds like, but there's been so little information,
2833000	2835000	but it's the only logical...
2835000	2838000	Occam's Razor says that he has a steep driveway
2838000	2841000	and he got out of his car to check his mail.
2841000	2844000	Yeah, he thought it was parked.
2844000	2846000	I don't want to die checking my mail.
2846000	2852000	I didn't want to talk about this.
2855000	2857000	It's really hot, I don't know.
2857000	2860000	Stephen King's Cell.
2860000	2863000	There's a movie you can get on your Apple TV.
2863000	2865000	Stephen King's Cell.
2865000	2867000	C-E-L-L.
2867000	2871000	Don't mistake it for the Jennifer Lopez Cell.
2871000	2875000	This is Stephen King's Cell.
2875000	2880000	You can remember it because it has Stephen King's before it,
2880000	2884000	which means so much.
2884000	2887000	It's a stamp of quality like none other.
2887000	2893000	Wait, wait, wait, how do you ever...
2893000	2895000	Is he ever...
2895000	2897000	What happens before someone says,
2897000	2899000	Stephen King's clam of mammas?
2899000	2901000	No way!
2901000	2903000	Why are people still...
2903000	2905000	It doesn't mean any...
2905000	2907000	It means bad, Stephen King's.
2907000	2910000	He did it. It means he did it.
2910000	2912000	But what does it even mean?
2912000	2914000	It means ooky spooky is what it means.
2914000	2916000	It doesn't mean good, it doesn't mean bad.
2916000	2917000	Ooky spooky.
2917000	2919000	Another pin on the sash.
2919000	2924000	Tom Clancy's something means that there's going to be geopolitical strife
2924000	2928000	and technological porn.
2928000	2931000	I assume, Roger Avery.
2931000	2935000	This is Roger Avery. I think I'm an actor.
2935000	2938000	I saw Stephen King took a picture of George R.R. Martin.
2938000	2943000	I was like, I hope he teaches him how to write stuff quickly.
2943000	2945000	You know?
2946000	2948000	You could trade some notes.
2948000	2949000	You got jokes.
2949000	2951000	Oh, yeah, I got jokes.
2954000	2960000	Anyways, Stephen King's sell, if you get a chance to watch it,
2960000	2964000	is the most exciting first 15 minutes, I think,
2964000	2967000	of a movie this cheap that you'll ever see.
2967000	2970000	John Kuzak's like at an airport and then it's like,
2970000	2974000	you know, Stephen King's America's dad.
2974000	2977000	So he's making a point about, or not making a point,
2977000	2980000	but just saying like, there's a lot of cell phones.
2982000	2986000	What if, you know, it's like everywhere you go there's a cell phone
2986000	2989000	and turning that into horror.
2989000	2991000	So it's John Kuzak's going through an airport
2991000	2994000	and everyone who's on a cell phone at a specific moment,
2994000	2996000	they all like go...
2998000	3001000	And then they all start stabbing each other and beating each other up.
3001000	3004000	Jesus, it's like my dad wrote that.
3004000	3007000	It's a pretty cheap movie.
3007000	3010000	Sam Jackson and John Kuzak,
3010000	3014000	they must have been the most expensive thing about the movie.
3014000	3017000	Like, oh, because it was very cheaply done,
3017000	3019000	but for a cheaply done movie that starts at an airport
3019000	3021000	with everyone starting to stab each other,
3021000	3024000	Cody and I were kind of freaked out.
3024000	3028000	But anyways, I'm not here to shill for Stephen King's sell.
3028000	3030000	I just want to tell you that eventually,
3030000	3033000	without any ceremony at all, at some point,
3033000	3035000	because it becomes about avoiding these people
3035000	3038000	who got too close to a cell signal,
3038000	3040000	they start calling them phoners.
3040000	3042000	I just wanted to tell you that.
3042000	3043000	Phoners.
3043000	3046000	And then they expect you to stay on the edge of your seat.
3046000	3049000	Oh, fuck, there's so many phoners over there.
3049000	3052000	They were so happy with that term when they came up with it.
3052000	3055000	I was like, just do a rewrite on that page.
3055000	3058000	Pay Tarantino a million dollars to come in.
3058000	3060000	Like, phoners?
3060000	3062000	Did we have a vote about that?
3062000	3064000	I don't know, motherfucker.
3064000	3066000	That's Sam Jackson.
3066000	3069000	They look like phoners to me.
3069000	3071000	Speaking of Sam Jackson,
3071000	3074000	there was another weird,
3074000	3076000	or it's great,
3076000	3079000	and that's not weird, but it was weirdly not weird.
3079000	3083000	Sam Jackson's character appears in the very beginning
3083000	3087000	to off-handedly mention totally indirectly
3087000	3091000	something that kind of clearly indicates that he's gay,
3091000	3093000	and it never comes up again.
3093000	3094000	Oh.
3094000	3096000	Which strikes your mind as weird,
3096000	3098000	because it's John Kuzak and Sam Jackson
3098000	3100000	walking through a subway tunnel,
3100000	3102000	and then Sam Jackson's character goes like,
3102000	3104000	huh, huh, yeah, well, my man done left me,
3104000	3106000	so now I'm alone.
3106000	3109000	And that's the last thing you ever hear about it, ever.
3109000	3111000	There's no, like, he's holding him up
3111000	3113000	from a pit full of phoners, and goes like,
3113000	3117000	use your love of men to grab my hand.
3117000	3119000	Like, there's nothing, and there's no, like,
3119000	3121000	sorry, I misjudged you, nothing.
3121000	3123000	It's just, but it's, like,
3123000	3125000	it was noteworthy to me,
3125000	3128000	because it shouldn't be noteworthy, and I'm 43.
3128000	3130000	So, Sam, it seems like he's doing this thing
3130000	3132000	where he's just making choices
3132000	3133000	and just sticking with him.
3133000	3134000	What were you talking about,
3134000	3137000	how he, like, had a weird lisp or something in a movie?
3137000	3139000	Sam Jackson, oh, God, will that...
3139000	3141000	Maybe this is what he...
3141000	3143000	Maybe this is what he does.
3143000	3145000	Like, he can't be interested.
3145000	3146000	Weird shit, and they keep it in?
3146000	3148000	Well, he just makes character choices,
3148000	3150000	and then those sometimes manifest in moments
3150000	3151000	we see in the final film.
3151000	3153000	Well, just like, character choices,
3153000	3156000	it almost seems to me like Samuel Jackson is just
3156000	3159000	some kind of intergalactic lottery winner
3159000	3162000	who, like, I'm not saying that in the sense of,
3162000	3164000	like, oh, he's a bad actor or whatever.
3164000	3168000	I just mean, like, where he is when he is there
3168000	3170000	just seems like he won a contest,
3170000	3173000	like he's just getting the VIP tour of a life.
3173000	3176000	He's like, I'm gonna be in Star Wars.
3176000	3178000	I'm a Jedi.
3178000	3182000	Hey, Iron Man, you're gonna be an Avenger.
3182000	3185000	This prison food tastes great.
3185000	3187000	Whoa, I got an Oscar.
3187000	3188000	I don't even know if he...
3188000	3190000	He might have nine Oscars, he might have zero,
3190000	3192000	I have no idea, but he's certainly...
3192000	3194000	He's, like, drifting through.
3194000	3196000	He's like Sirens of Titan, like...
3196000	3198000	He's like a Vonnegut character.
3198000	3200000	He's just having fun.
3200000	3202000	He's like, you want to hear about sharks?
3202000	3204000	Here's ice and a shark eats them.
3204000	3206000	Then he's out of the old shitty movie.
3206000	3207000	There's snakes on the plane.
3207000	3210000	I don't have to tell you what he's done.
3210000	3212000	But you guys aren't agreeing with me?
3212000	3213000	No, I agree.
3213000	3215000	Like, more than any other actor, you wouldn't...
3215000	3218000	It's like, if you were an alien species
3218000	3221000	and you wanted to ride a human actor through Earth,
3221000	3224000	would you choose Richard Dreyfus?
3225000	3226000	It's like, oh, what?
3226000	3228000	It's just like, that's like going to the pyramids
3228000	3229000	and taking a picture.
3229000	3231000	Like, oh, he was in Jaws.
3231000	3233000	Samuel Jackson, you frickin'...
3233000	3236000	Whoa, shit, man.
3236000	3237000	I agree.
3237000	3239000	I'm just trying not to faint up here.
3239000	3240000	Oh.
3240000	3241000	All right, well, I don't know why I'm seeking
3241000	3242000	your guys' approval.
3242000	3245000	There's an orange fascist running for president.
3245000	3249000	Openly fascist, absolutely openly fascist,
3249000	3253000	bragged about revoking the Washington Post's
3253000	3258000	credentials because he doesn't like their lies.
3258000	3260000	Like, there was a Washington Post article
3260000	3262000	right before that happened that was like,
3262000	3266000	this is a transcript of us talking to Donald Trump.
3266000	3268000	Like, obviously, in response to like,
3268000	3272000	what do we have to do to stop being told we're lying
3272000	3273000	or misrepresenting?
3273000	3275000	You sound this dumb.
3275000	3278000	You came to our office to talk to us about how dumb we are.
3278000	3279000	We...
3279000	3282000	Here's the whole transcript.
3283000	3286000	What do you want from us?
3289000	3292000	Donald Trump, bad guy.
3292000	3296000	It's a bad day to be an alligator, you know?
3296000	3297000	Yeah, man.
3297000	3298000	It's no good.
3298000	3299000	Yeah, it's a bad day.
3299000	3301000	Right after they found that like,
3301000	3304000	giant fucking alligator on that golf course, too, right?
3304000	3305000	Yeah, yeah.
3305000	3306000	Like, what's gonna happen to him now?
3306000	3308000	That's a bummer.
3308000	3309000	He'll be fine.
3309000	3311000	I don't know, man. I'm worried.
3311000	3312000	About the alligator?
3312000	3313000	Yeah.
3313000	3314000	Well, that thing's like a dinosaur.
3314000	3315000	Like, that's a...
3315000	3316000	Like a national...
3316000	3317000	Nope.
3317000	3318000	That's a national treasure.
3318000	3319000	Yeah.
3319000	3321000	I've been a little offended by the alligator coverage.
3321000	3325000	I feel like it's...
3325000	3329000	Could we ever at any point say,
3329000	3330000	we get it.
3330000	3333000	Corporate America is unaccountable.
3335000	3336000	What?
3336000	3337000	It's okay.
3337000	3339000	But can we just call it a fucking tragedy
3340000	3342000	that the alligator is fucking...
3342000	3343000	I don't even...
3343000	3345000	It hasn't even been acknowledged.
3345000	3346000	That it's a tragedy?
3346000	3347000	Yeah.
3347000	3348000	I feel like that may have been acknowledged.
3348000	3349000	It's controversy.
3349000	3353000	Well, like, you get 10 points for being technically right,
3353000	3356000	but I'm expressing an emotional, subjective thing.
3356000	3358000	I just keep the coverage of it.
3358000	3360000	I'm sorry that I've encountered.
3360000	3361000	I haven't.
3361000	3363000	By the way, geez, moment of silence
3363000	3367000	for a fucking victim of society, period.
3367000	3369000	No matter how...
3369000	3370000	It's just like...
3370000	3371000	I retweeted the thing.
3371000	3373000	It was like CNN,
3373000	3377000	the story from the fucking alligator side of it,
3377000	3380000	and how sometimes kids just look delicious.
3380000	3382000	I don't fucking care
3382000	3385000	if this is the most careless family in the world.
3385000	3387000	It's ridiculous.
3387000	3388000	You're selling people's safety.
3388000	3389000	I don't...
3389000	3390000	Who cares?
3390000	3392000	You're not going to lose your fucking giant corporation.
3392000	3393000	It's not at risk.
3393000	3394000	It's not going to happen.
3394000	3398000	Just say, we're sorry one of our alligators ate you.
3398000	3399000	We're sorry.
3399000	3403000	It seems like one of our alligators ate you.
3403000	3405000	Tomorrow's going to be double-pumped...
3405000	3407000	pump-dumps.
3407000	3409000	Bring a dump-pump,
3409000	3412000	and you'll get two pump-dumbles.
3412000	3414000	Sorry about the alligators.
3414000	3415000	Look.
3415000	3416000	You mean, happiest place on earth
3416000	3417000	is going to be some unhappiness
3417000	3421000	running like rivulets down the gutters outside
3421000	3423000	and into the giant generator
3423000	3425000	that runs on mostly Arab blood,
3425000	3431000	but some of yours.
3431000	3440000	Some of yours every once in a while.
3440000	3445000	I wonder how Flint, Michigan's doing.
3445000	3446000	That really fell off
3446000	3448000	once Trump started gaining steam.
3448000	3449000	People stop caring about that.
3449000	3451000	This is no good.
3451000	3452000	What was happening?
3452000	3453000	What was the latest in Flint?
3453000	3454000	It just poisoned all the water.
3454000	3455000	Yeah, it was great.
3455000	3458000	Was Flint where the natural gas was coming up,
3458000	3459000	or was that...
3459000	3460000	Where was that?
3460000	3461000	I don't know about it.
3461000	3463000	It shut down all the factories
3463000	3465000	from the auto industry.
3465000	3466000	Hello, real Annie.
3466000	3469000	It's the documentary where there was Roger and me.
3469000	3470000	Right.
3470000	3472000	Well, that's the information I've been going on,
3472000	3474000	but I wasn't going to be like,
3474000	3476000	I know all about Flint from Roger and me,
3476000	3477000	because I'm 43.
3477000	3479000	The water supply from the Detroit water
3479000	3480000	to the Flint River,
3480000	3483000	and since there was a lot of corrosion,
3483000	3485000	the pipes were lead pipes,
3485000	3487000	and the water from the Flint River
3487000	3489000	was so polluted that the lead got out
3489000	3491000	and poisoned all the children of Flint,
3491000	3493000	which is like 90%.
3493000	3495000	Also non-children.
3495000	3496000	Also non-children.
3496000	3497000	Yeah.
3497000	3499000	Now the children have been lead poisoning
3499000	3501000	for two years or something,
3501000	3503000	and they're all retarded or something.
3503000	3505000	What about all the alligators?
3505000	3507000	I heard that loud and clear,
3507000	3509000	and you were very good at it.
3509000	3510000	I think probably everybody here did,
3510000	3512000	but I worry about the podcast hearing them.
3512000	3514000	Look up Flint, Michigan,
3514000	3516000	if you didn't hear what happened.
3516000	3518000	No, they poisoned the water.
3518000	3519000	They did something to the pipes,
3519000	3521000	and because the pipes were not maintained,
3521000	3523000	it leached lead into the pipes.
3523000	3524000	Poison the water.
3524000	3526000	Why would they poison the water?
3526000	3528000	Because it saved money.
3529000	3531000	That seems crazy.
3531000	3532000	It's going to cost 100 bucks
3532000	3534000	to haul all this poison out of here.
3534000	3535000	That?
3535000	3537000	We might need to drink that later.
3537000	3538000	Of all the things you get poisoned,
3538000	3540000	why the water?
3541000	3542000	Poison the grass?
3542000	3543000	I can understand.
3543000	3545000	I got a rash the other day.
3545000	3546000	Why is it the alligator?
3546000	3548000	I'm America's ant.
3551000	3552000	Why would you?
3552000	3553000	My new character.
3553000	3555000	Let's have America's ant talk to Tom.
3555000	3556000	Remember Tom from earlier?
3556000	3557000	Wait, what?
3557000	3558000	Hey.
3558000	3559000	Remember Tom?
3559000	3560000	He was a giant.
3560000	3561000	Wait, wait.
3561000	3562000	I don't know.
3562000	3563000	I'm sorry.
3563000	3568000	Tom was in the pitch room for Now You See Me.
3568000	3569000	Oh, Now You See Me.
3569000	3570000	Yes, yes, yes.
3570000	3571000	Sorry.
3571000	3572000	I'm sorry.
3572000	3573000	I'm sorry.
3573000	3574000	I was looking at this thing, and I was like, sorry.
3574000	3575000	Tom, why would they?
3575000	3576000	Well, forget it.
3576000	3577000	I'm going to do that bit.
3577000	3578000	Hey.
3578000	3581000	Magicians have sexy ladies around them sometimes.
3581000	3582000	I know, Tom.
3582000	3587000	Maybe Isla Fisher's character is an escape artist.
3587000	3588000	Tom, we've been over this.
3588000	3590000	Hold it.
3590000	3595000	Before the escape, she takes off her clothes.
3595000	3596000	Tom, you're a genius.
3596000	3598000	Classic character.
3598000	3599000	Classic character?
3599000	3603000	This is the musical score for Now You See Me 1.
3603000	3604000	I haven't seen 2.
3604000	3607000	Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da.
3607000	3609000	Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da.
3609000	3612000	Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da.
3612000	3613000	Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da.
3613000	3614000	For an hour.
3615000	3622000	And I'm saying this, I'm telling you this, I'm saying watch it.
3622000	3623000	I'm telling you to watch it.
3623000	3625000	I'm not telling you don't watch it.
3625000	3627000	I'm telling you, you've got to see this movie.
3627000	3632000	Also, when they introduced the magicians, I mean, you said that the woman was just sexual
3632000	3642000	or whatever, but there was a decrease in the level of magic from the beginning.
3642000	3646000	Like first it was, what's his name?
3646000	3648000	Jesse Eisenberg.
3648000	3649000	Jesse, yeah.
3649000	3650000	He was amazing.
3650000	3651000	Then it got steadily worse and worse.
3651000	3656000	By amazing, you mean he said pick a card and then the card was on a skyscraper.
3656000	3657000	You're talking about Now You See Me 1.
3657000	3658000	I have the storyboards memorized.
3658000	3659000	Yeah, I was on a skyscraper.
3659000	3660000	I guess that wasn't accurate.
3660000	3663000	And then they go around and then I don't want to get a beef with the Franco's.
3663000	3667000	I've been adamant about this, but one of the Franco's is in it and he's on a boat.
3667000	3670000	And this is one of the classic archetypes of magician.
3670000	3674000	If you're going to get a super group of magicians together, he goes like, I'm going to bend
3674000	3675000	the spoon.
3675000	3677000	And then someone's like, you didn't bend the spoon.
3677000	3678000	And then he's like, I guess I didn't.
3678000	3679000	He got your wallet.
3679000	3683000	But it's like, so a pickpocket is one of the magician types.
3683000	3692000	But then later he'll turn out to be a car racer and a mimic.
3692000	3694000	That's not a spoiler.
3694000	3696000	Watch Now You See Me 1.
3696000	3698000	It features one of the Franco's.
3699000	3706000	He does sleight of hand foo to make Ruffalo restrained.
3706000	3709000	And then Ruffalo goes like, what are you doing?
3709000	3711000	And he goes, what are you doing?
3711000	3714000	And he goes like, what's your end game?
3714000	3715000	What's your end game?
3715000	3718000	And he takes the walkie-talkie and Ruffalo's like, no.
3718000	3720000	And he's like, go to aisle seven.
3720000	3727000	But it's Ruffalo's voice coming out of Franco's mouth because he's a predator now because he's a magician.
3727000	3729000	It's one of the four types of magician.
3729000	3735000	The other one is a assistant that is naked.
3735000	3738000	The sequel is Not Called Now You Don't.
3738000	3739000	It can't.
3739000	3740000	By law, it cannot be.
3740000	3743000	That would technically be a different movie.
3743000	3746000	Is it Then You Saw Me?
3746000	3749000	That's the prequel, isn't it?
3749000	3751000	That's when they reboot it.
3751000	3753000	That's when you'll see me.
3754000	3757000	We'll be seeing each other soon.
3757000	3759000	But for tonight, Paris.
3762000	3763000	All right.
3763000	3766000	So, balls?
3766000	3767000	Yeah.
3767000	3768000	What's hot?
3768000	3770000	You guys are a little, we're picking up on your-
3770000	3771000	It's hot here.
3771000	3772000	It's hot.
3772000	3773000	What do you get?
3773000	3774000	Oh, it's hot.
3774000	3775000	I offered her a hair tie.
3775000	3776000	Because of the heat.
3776000	3777000	It's going great.
3777000	3779000	Why did you have a hair tie?
3779000	3780000	How long are these shows?
3780000	3781000	I have kind of long.
3781000	3782000	Do you?
3782000	3784000	Well, it's getting in the hat.
3784000	3785000	Do you?
3785000	3786000	It's a little old.
3786000	3787000	I didn't use it.
3787000	3788000	Okay.
3788000	3789000	Fair enough.
3789000	3792000	I mean, I'd invite you up to talk about it.
3792000	3793000	But you'd be way hotter up here.
3793000	3794000	I mean, it's so much hotter.
3794000	3795000	Yeah.
3795000	3796000	You have lights.
3796000	3797000	I want to be bald.
3797000	3798000	Do you have a hair tie?
3798000	3799000	Does anybody have a bald cap?
3799000	3800000	I'd like to put that-
3800000	3803000	No, you take the hair tie.
3803000	3804000	You-
3806000	3807000	Whoa.
3808000	3809000	Okay.
3809000	3810000	All right.
3810000	3811000	Okay.
3811000	3817000	Here's a segment for which I would invite audience interaction.
3817000	3818000	Rude.
3818000	3819000	Rude.
3819000	3820000	Rude.
3820000	3821000	Come on.
3821000	3822000	That's it.
3822000	3823000	Of all the things you can say.
3823000	3824000	Say hurtful.
3824000	3825000	Don't say rude.
3825000	3826000	Rude is going to trigger me.
3826000	3827000	Rude.
3827000	3828000	Rude.
3828000	3829000	I'll show you fucking rude.
3829000	3830000	No, no.
3830000	3831000	Say hurtful.
3831000	3832000	Then I'll be like, I'm sorry.
3832000	3833000	I didn't-
3833000	3834000	Rude.
3834000	3835000	Fuck you.
3835000	3836000	Rude.
3836000	3837000	Rude.
3837000	3838000	Rude.
3838000	3839000	Rude.
3839000	3840000	Rude.
3840000	3841000	Rude.
3841000	3842000	Fuck you.
3842000	3843000	You're rude.
3843000	3844000	It's very hot.
3844000	3845000	We're all irritated.
3845000	3846000	All right.
3846000	3847000	Okay.
3847000	3849000	How long are these shows?
3849000	3850000	You can leave.
3850000	3851000	You guys are triggering my shame.
3851000	3852000	Sorry.
3852000	3853000	Sorry.
3853000	3856200	My therapist says I have a very, very low shame threshold.
3856200	3862000	It's like if you track all of my negative behavior, it's all due to the fact that I'm
3862000	3866000	very easily shamed and startled.
3867000	3871000	She told Cody Dan's going to be easily startled.
3871000	3873000	And I'm like, what?
3873000	3876000	And then sure enough, I was like, oh, God damn it.
3876000	3877000	I am really-
3877000	3879000	I don't want to trigger you, but you're a bad guy.
3879000	3880000	No.
3880000	3881000	Well, that's not-
3884000	3886000	What's this segment you were talking about?
3886000	3887000	Oh, it's okay.
3887000	3888000	It's moving along.
3888000	3889000	Wow.
3889000	3891000	Well, this language of like wins it over.
3891000	3892000	I'm sorry.
3892000	3894000	It's just that's my bit because I got nothing else.
3894000	3895000	All right.
3895000	3896000	It just wants to leave.
3896000	3897000	No, they don't.
3897000	3898000	They love it here.
3898000	3899000	It's still game of thrones to watch.
3899000	3900000	I mean, obviously it goes without saying.
3900000	3901000	If you want to leave, you can leave.
3901000	3902000	Thank you.
3902000	3903000	That's all right.
3903000	3904500	I don't mean to say that in a passive aggressive way.
3904500	3908000	I will make the show better.
3908000	3912600	If you don't have to tell me if it's going wrong, I think it's going to go great by the
3912600	3915280	end.
3915280	3919000	And if you pay attention, the next segment might involve you.
3919000	3923160	I mean, I just want- is it an hour or one?
3923160	3924160	So-
3924160	3925160	You're doing this.
3925160	3926160	You're doing it still.
3926160	3927160	I know.
3927160	3932040	Well, I thought I was- I didn't think you'd hear me.
3932040	3934040	It's 9-11, by the way.
3934040	3935040	Yeah.
3935040	3940800	Time to talk about politics.
3940800	3943400	I like Hillary Clinton because-
3943400	3946320	Oh, I thought that's what you get high.
3946320	3947320	No.
3947320	3948320	What?
3948320	3949320	9-11, man.
3949320	3950320	4-20.
3950320	3951320	Oh, 4-20.
3951320	3952320	Jeez.
3952320	3953320	What's this segment?
3953320	3957560	The segment is- okay, I want to be careful about how I ask for these volunteers.
3957560	3959760	LA's pretty cool.
3959760	3961800	We usually get pretty balanced.
3961800	3962800	You don't have to be balanced.
3962800	3963920	You can be imbalanced, too.
3963920	3965920	I think we've proven that.
3965920	3969400	I'm just saying, like, just don't- you know, obviously, you're not going to run up because
3969400	3970400	you want to be on stage.
3970400	3972280	I really want you for a specific role.
3972280	3980120	I want you to be passionate about, on either side of the issue, pineapple on pizza.
3980120	3981120	That's it.
3981120	3982120	That's awesome.
3982120	3984840	This guy's hand shot up first.
3984840	3986560	Let's diversify a little, though.
3986560	3987560	Yeah, you come up.
3987560	3989880	We've got a white male, probably-
3989880	3990880	Cisgender.
3990880	3991880	Cisgender.
3991880	3992880	How many people do you bring?
3992880	3993880	We've got- we've got frickin' privilege.
3993880	3995880	Can we- is- is-
3995880	3999360	I see a lady in the middle back, maybe.
3999360	4000360	Let's at least- yeah.
4000360	4002960	Well, yeah, why am I mixing it up, though?
4002960	4007840	But I still think we should- well, we've got- there's a young lady here raising both
4007840	4011080	hands that- is- that- you come on up?
4011080	4013120	You're- well, oh, wait, wait, no, we fucked up!
4013120	4014120	Yeah.
4014120	4015720	We've got to go one at a time, right?
4015720	4017360	Hold on, young lady, I'm sorry.
4017360	4020400	You have to- you have to stand there in the deck first- the deck.
4020400	4023280	The deck is what I call the- the awkward deck.
4023280	4024280	Uh-
4024280	4025280	All right.
4025280	4026280	Well, have a seat.
4026280	4027280	How about you sit up here?
4027280	4028280	It'll be great.
4028280	4033320	No, up here, right here, in the good place, not the down- not the bad- you're a bad person
4033320	4034320	place.
4034320	4035320	All right.
4035320	4036320	Okay.
4036320	4037320	What's your name, young man?
4037320	4038320	Hunter.
4038320	4039320	Hunter?
4039320	4040320	Yeah.
4040320	4041320	All right.
4041320	4042320	Four against?
4042320	4043320	Four.
4043320	4044320	Okay.
4044320	4045320	And I don't suppose by some coincidence you're against?
4045320	4046320	God damn it.
4046320	4047320	No, I'm also four.
4047320	4048320	Okay, that's fine.
4048320	4049320	I can argue against.
4049320	4050320	It'll be great.
4050320	4051320	Really good.
4051320	4052320	What's your name, young lady?
4052320	4053320	I would never argue against Emily.
4053320	4054320	What's your name?
4054320	4055320	Emily?
4055320	4056320	Emily?
4056320	4057320	Emily?
4057320	4058320	Emily?
4058320	4059320	Emily?
4059320	4060320	Emily?
4060320	4061320	Emily?
4061320	4062320	Emily?
4062320	4063320	Emily?
4063320	4064320	Emily?
4064320	4065320	Emily?
4065320	4066320	Emily?
4066320	4069160	No, don't- that never cuts the whole thing.
4069160	4071960	I really want passion here.
4071960	4075540	You already- I mean, now people know that you're a sociopath.
4075540	4081200	I can totally see the reason against, though, like absolutely.
4081200	4082440	Another sociopath over there.
4082440	4083440	Yeah.
4083440	4084440	Yeah.
4084440	4085440	Yeah.
4085440	4086440	It's like, they found one and it wasn't me.
4086440	4087440	Oh, yeah.
4087440	4088440	Can I help you move?
4088440	4089440	It's a pain cast.
4089440	4090440	He named my disease.
4090440	4094440	I'm never allowed to applaud that.
4095440	4100440	That's why- that's why the witch burnings were so popular.
4100440	4102440	Well, they got one!
4102440	4104440	They got one of us!
4104440	4111440	So, we need a- I think, like, we need somebody who's so against-
4111440	4113440	Black woman against over here.
4113440	4114440	Sorry.
4114440	4117440	That didn't sound like a black woman.
4117440	4122440	Okay, we have a- that's an advocate for, you said, black woman against.
4123440	4126440	But I gotta be sure- we can't force you to come up.
4126440	4131440	Like, you've got a strong advocate if you'd love to come up.
4134440	4136440	Dino, go with the table.
4136440	4137440	The table.
4137440	4142440	I think the title of this episode should be black woman against over here.
4144440	4150440	And I'm gonna submit that for a standard, like, construction sign, like, type of thing
4150440	4152440	that you can hang around this city.
4152440	4154440	Who knows when that can come in handy?
4154440	4155440	What's your name?
4155440	4156440	Juliana.
4156440	4157440	Juliana?
4157440	4158440	All right.
4158440	4162440	So, you're so against- well, I'm against two, so maybe it's two against two.
4162440	4164440	I don't know what to do now, though.
4164440	4170440	I just wanna- my only thought was, like, because it was such a weird thing,
4170440	4174440	because I was hearing some people talk about how amazing pineapple and pizza was.
4174440	4175440	Some people.
4175440	4176440	Yeah, some people.
4176440	4178440	What the fuck, man?
4179440	4181440	Do you mean- do you mean racially?
4181440	4182440	Is that what you're saying?
4182440	4183440	No, we were in the green room.
4183440	4185440	I'm right here.
4187440	4190440	I thought he was, like, some people.
4190440	4191440	What do you mean, some people?
4191440	4193440	What do you mean, some people?
4193440	4194440	Oh, okay.
4194440	4195440	So, you're four.
4195440	4197440	So, now we got three four pineapples.
4197440	4198440	Yeah, yeah.
4198440	4199440	This is a mess.
4199440	4200440	I mean, I don't know.
4200440	4204440	What I was gonna do was have two people come up.
4204440	4205440	We can still do that.
4205440	4207440	What do you mean, two people?
4208440	4211440	And just let them do a minute each and just, like, see how it goes.
4211440	4212440	We can still do it.
4212440	4213440	That'll be great.
4213440	4215440	Well, we got two four pineapples.
4215440	4220440	I got plans to smooth this all out as we proceed.
4220440	4222440	Well, what would the next thing I do?
4222440	4224440	Well, let's start with a pro, probably, right?
4224440	4225440	Right.
4225440	4227440	So, a minute each, or just-
4227440	4230440	Yeah, we go a minute of pro, a minute of con, a minute of pro,
4230440	4231440	and then we can get another con.
4231440	4232440	Here we go.
4232440	4233440	Okay, so, forgot your name again.
4233440	4234440	Sorry.
4234440	4235440	Hey, my name is Emily.
4235440	4237440	Emily, I'm gonna give you a minute.
4237440	4238440	I'm totally ready.
4238440	4239440	Okay, here you go.
4239440	4242440	So, when people are like, Pixar is really good at making movies, are they like,
4242440	4246440	hey, what's so great about Pixar movies is that they're just funny
4246440	4249440	and they're never sad and they're never touching.
4249440	4251440	Do people say that about Pixar movies?
4251440	4252440	No.
4252440	4253440	No, they don't.
4253440	4257440	It would be really great if I had, like, a second example to go after Pixar movies.
4257440	4258440	I don't.
4258440	4259440	That's all I have.
4259440	4262440	What's great about pineapples on pizza is that they're sweet and tangy
4262440	4264440	and they're also savory and salty.
4264440	4267440	That's clearly a superior combination.
4267440	4270440	When you wake up in the morning and you're like, oh, breakfast.
4270440	4273440	I'm so psyched about breakfast because I have never in my life
4273440	4278440	craved a sweet thing and breakfast is a meal predicated solely on savory things.
4278440	4281440	No, you don't say that because breakfast is amazing
4281440	4284440	and breakfast includes both sweet and savory things.
4284440	4285440	Whoo!
4285440	4286440	Thank you.
4286440	4287440	All right.
4287440	4288440	Okay.
4288440	4289440	That was 48.
4289440	4290440	Yeah, and you can-
4290440	4291440	That was all I needed.
4291440	4292440	That was good.
4292440	4293440	Tie it into America.
4293440	4294440	I love that.
4294440	4295440	That was great.
4295440	4297440	So now do we- what do you think Spencer?
4297440	4298440	Like, counterpoint?
4298440	4301440	We should probably- the next thing we should hear should be anti-pineapples.
4301440	4302440	Yeah, exactly.
4302440	4303440	So it's between- I'm sorry.
4303440	4304440	Juliana, right?
4304440	4309440	Juliana and I'll do one too, but you want to go first or second?
4309440	4310440	I mean-
4310440	4311440	You should go.
4311440	4312440	You should go.
4312440	4313440	I'm sorry.
4313440	4314440	I need to be a better leader.
4314440	4315440	I'm sorry.
4315440	4318440	You do it.
4318440	4319440	You can take a minute or less.
4319440	4320440	A minute or less.
4320440	4321440	Here we go.
4321440	4323440	It's just an abomination, like-
4323440	4333440	It's just as- it's just as bad as having, like, hot beer and deep-fried watermelon.
4333440	4336440	It's just- does it make sense to me?
4336440	4342440	Like, fruit is- fruit on pizza is like, why wouldn't anyone want to eat pineapple for?
4342440	4344440	I mean, I'm sorry.
4344440	4345440	It's just an abomination.
4345440	4347440	It's just how I just describe it.
4347440	4353440	I know it's, like, not a huge explanation or argument, but I just feel like an abomination
4353440	4356440	just describes everything about it.
4356440	4357440	All right.
4357440	4358440	Tie it into America.
4358440	4359440	Yes.
4359440	4364440	Well, I kind of- I mean, I feel in a crazy way we are tying it into America.
4364440	4366440	Like, do you want any more time?
4366440	4370440	Is it- you can- you can- I- doesn't matter.
4370440	4374440	I mean, you get applause for one sentence.
4374440	4379440	I just feel that pineapple is just one of the fruits that- it just doesn't make sense
4379440	4380440	to me.
4380440	4385440	Like, watermelon- I mean, it's not just because I'm black, but I just like watermelon.
4385440	4386440	All right.
4386440	4388440	Well, time's up and that was getting complicated.
4388440	4394440	Secretary of Defense of-
4395440	4400440	Okay.
4400440	4401440	Okay.
4401440	4402440	So, goddamn it.
4402440	4404440	Why don't I ever ask names if I'm never going to remember?
4404440	4405440	Hunter.
4405440	4406440	Hunter.
4406440	4407440	Great.
4407440	4408440	Okay.
4408440	4409440	Hunter, you're going to go pro- pineapple?
4409440	4410440	Yeah, I'm going to do pro-pineapple.
4410440	4411440	All right.
4411440	4412440	Start.
4412440	4413440	Go.
4413440	4414440	All right.
4414440	4415440	So, I want to tie it into the theme of the show of the precision magic.
4415440	4420440	So, you know, the precision- the film is like a magic trick and I feel like we were missing
4420440	4421440	that the whole time.
4421440	4426440	So, when you eat a pineapple and I'm going to go with ham pizza, you start with it so
4426440	4427440	you're not looking at it.
4427440	4429880	You get the saltiness and you're like, oh, this is really good.
4429880	4433440	I hope it's not all one note and you keep having it and you're like, oh, it's a little
4433440	4436960	bit of dairy, a little bit of a nice bland flavor and then it mixes it up like a one-two
4436960	4441080	punch with pineapple and you're like, oh, it's a different texture and it's sweet and
4441080	4443200	it was leading me to this whole point all along.
4443200	4444600	This is what I expected.
4444600	4445600	Same with the reverse point.
4445600	4446920	Like, oh, it's all this sweet pizza.
4446920	4447920	I'm not really used to it.
4447920	4451320	And then you get the salt after and you're like, oh my God, it's so many flavors.
4451320	4452320	Packed into one.
4452320	4453320	Like, I can't even believe it.
4453320	4454320	Oh my God.
4454320	4455320	It's very true.
4455320	4456320	All right.
4456320	4462320	And so, Dan, you're, you're con, right?
4462320	4463320	I'm con.
4463320	4464320	I'm con.
4464320	4465320	I'm con.
4465320	4466320	So why don't you round us out?
4466320	4467320	Well, okay.
4467320	4468320	I'm going to do it.
4468320	4469320	Cool.
4469320	4470320	Cool.
4470320	4471320	I'm going to do.
4471320	4472320	Wait.
4472320	4474320	Do you know that the Prestige is a movie and it also has magic in it?
4474320	4475320	Yeah.
4475320	4476320	Okay.
4476320	4477320	So we do like a magic.
4477320	4480320	A bunch of us apparently were like, why, why aren't you bringing that up?
4480320	4481320	What?
4481320	4483320	Cause you can't talk about everything.
4483320	4487320	I clearly times at a premium on my show.
4487320	4490320	Like, where's the apex?
4490320	4491320	What do you mean?
4491320	4492320	Where's the impact?
4492320	4493320	It was like, it was like two points of a triangle.
4493320	4494320	I'm like, where's the apex?
4494320	4495320	Oh yeah.
4495320	4496320	Right now.
4496320	4497320	We're at the apex.
4497320	4501320	We all thought, we all thought you had like a big, good, like Chris Nolan point coming.
4501320	4504320	You're looking at perspective.
4504320	4508680	If you knew from my perspective, you'd be like, oh yeah, like every single thing I talk
4509680	4511680	about is like one third of something I was trying to get to.
4511680	4515680	So I never, I mean, I probably would have talked about, I wanted to talk about like,
4515680	4519680	oh, Spencer, what would we, I don't know where the fuck we got off track, but it was like
4519680	4520680	the idea.
4520680	4521680	We're on track.
4521680	4522680	We're on track.
4522680	4523680	Anyway, sorry.
4523680	4524680	Sorry.
4524680	4526680	But no, I'm coming back around a year.
4526680	4527680	Yeah, you're right.
4527680	4528680	It is weird.
4528680	4529680	I would have, I would have come around to that topic.
4529680	4530680	I would have.
4530680	4531680	No, you wouldn't know.
4531680	4533680	I didn't mean to shame you.
4533680	4534680	All right.
4534680	4537680	But I am now about to shame you.
4538680	4539680	Okay, here we go.
4539680	4540680	Let's keep this to a minute now.
4540680	4541680	All right.
4541680	4542680	So here's the thing.
4542680	4543680	It's pizza.
4543680	4544680	Okay.
4544680	4547680	Now my partner sounded a little xenophobic.
4547680	4550680	It's like, it's like, oh, I hate it.
4550680	4554680	It's like, let's talk about what a pizza is.
4554680	4556680	Is it sweet?
4556680	4559680	Is it in the dessert section of the menu?
4559680	4564680	Or are you ordering a greasy, salty, cheesy, bready thing?
4564680	4570680	Too many people look at pizza as if it's an opportunity to express themselves.
4570680	4574680	And not enough people just order something other than pizza.
4574680	4578680	Be that person at the party that says, you know what?
4578680	4579680	I can't like pizza.
4579680	4584680	I'd like a chicken barbecue pineapple salad.
4584680	4588680	Oh, Anthony's at the party?
4588680	4591680	Anthony, eat pizza.
4591680	4594680	Stop disrupting the party.
4594680	4596680	You've infected the culture.
4596680	4601680	You've infected my soul.
4601680	4605680	That was exactly one minute.
4605680	4606680	All right.
4606680	4611680	So I have a, I mean, it's, I have an unfair weight, literally and figuratively.
4611680	4614680	Like, I, like, we can't take like a vote.
4614680	4616680	Like, like what does it matter?
4616680	4618680	Why can we not take a vote?
4618680	4619680	Okay.
4619680	4620680	Okay.
4620680	4621680	Physical challenge.
4621680	4626680	Well, wait, I think, wait, before we, before we make it binary and like, like, like, like,
4626680	4627680	like, let's make it constructive.
4627680	4629680	Because here's one thing that I'd like to point out.
4629680	4640680	Because how many of you here hearing these two are having second thoughts about pineapple's merit on a pizza?
4640680	4641680	Oh, Jesus.
4641680	4642680	Four people.
4642680	4643680	Okay.
4643680	4644680	Okay.
4644680	4645680	The people have raised their hands.
4645680	4649680	I found myself going like, why am I blocking all this passion?
4649680	4653680	Like, you guys did a good job, I think, of making it a positive thing.
4653680	4658680	But then again, it's about advocating for a fucking ridiculous prop on top of a pizza.
4658680	4665680	It's not like you could take a negative position and go like, it's pizza and Steve, not pizza and...
4665680	4667680	There's nothing you can do that doesn't sound positive.
4667680	4668680	I will say that.
4668680	4672680	Like, you get to sound like fucking woke by going like, why not try new shit?
4672680	4678680	That's why I was going like, because it's pizza, motherfucker.
4678680	4679680	All right.
4679680	4681680	So, I mean, it doesn't need to be a result.
4681680	4682680	I mean, we got to...
4682680	4683680	But we'll make it official.
4683680	4684680	I know.
4684680	4685680	Calm back.
4685680	4686680	All right.
4686680	4687680	The question is...
4687680	4688680	That's outlawed now.
4688680	4692680	A plot if you accept pineapple on pizza.
4692680	4694680	They're vocal.
4694680	4695680	They're vocal.
4695680	4697680	That sounds like time too hard.
4697680	4705680	A plot if you refuse to let pizza be violated.
4705680	4707680	This is why America's going to die.
4707680	4709680	Dude, do we beat Truman all over again?
4709680	4710680	That's all Donald Trump does.
4710680	4711680	It's like easy.
4711680	4718680	A plot if you just want huge, huge, very, very strong pizza.
4718680	4721680	But, yeah, when you...
4721680	4722680	It's stickier.
4722680	4724680	Negative things are stickier.
4724680	4725680	It's easier.
4725680	4727680	When I was in debate in high school, I was on the negative.
4727680	4728680	Did you do debate?
4728680	4729680	Yeah, I did debate.
4729680	4730680	I don't mean to...
4730680	4733680	It's a racist stereotype.
4733680	4734680	Sorry.
4734680	4736680	I don't mean to assume...
4736680	4737680	It's a black girl.
4737680	4738680	It's a debate captain.
4738680	4740680	Can I say one thing about this real quick?
4740680	4741680	Can I say one thing?
4741680	4742680	I was like...
4742680	4743680	I hope so.
4743680	4744680	Well, yeah.
4744680	4747680	But what if what you say is Hitler was right?
4747680	4748680	No, I don't.
4748680	4750680	And then I'm like, you said...
4750680	4752680	Yes, you can speak.
4752680	4754680	But I want to judge what you say.
4754680	4755680	No, yeah, absolutely.
4755680	4756680	So you know recently you were talking about...
4756680	4757680	What the fuck?
4757680	4758680	No, I'm sorry.
4758680	4759680	I'm sorry.
4759680	4760680	I'm so drunk and high.
4760680	4761680	Sorry, go ahead.
4761680	4763680	I think it was you and Spencer were talking about conspiracy theories and how it's easier
4763680	4765680	to work from the back end of it.
4765680	4769680	So you can work from what's there and then you say, oh, I can work against what's been
4769680	4770680	said.
4770680	4771680	It's kind of the same with negative points.
4771680	4773680	It's easier to find negative points than something.
4773680	4774680	Of course.
4774680	4775680	Well, that's the tough thing.
4775680	4778680	When we do debate in high school, there was the affirmative?
4778680	4779680	Affirmative, yeah.
4779680	4780680	Affirmative, negative.
4780680	4782680	You had to come up with a plan if you were affirmative.
4782680	4783680	Prison overcrowding.
4783680	4787680	Oh, and then the negative you would just show up and be like...
4787680	4790680	We had a recipe box full of negative evidence cards.
4790680	4792680	It didn't even matter what the topic was.
4792680	4797680	You'd just pull out Alan Greenspan says we're headed for a recession.
4797680	4800680	You're armed with that when you don't want anything done.
4800680	4806680	Well, first of all, Alan Greenspan says he always says we're headed for a recession except
4806680	4808680	when we are.
4808680	4810680	It was just like prison overcrowding.
4810680	4812680	You're proposing we build a biodome.
4812680	4815680	Well, Alan Greenspan says we won't have the money.
4815680	4816680	I bid you good day.
4816680	4818680	Yeah, it's easier to be negative.
4818680	4820680	It's easier to keep your pizza pure.
4820680	4826680	I feel like if you have that variety in your life of more open minded to accept...
4826680	4829680	It's like soup sort of like people hate putting all the shit in soup.
4829680	4831680	Who hates putting all the shit in soup?
4831680	4832680	Oh, come on.
4832680	4833680	There are people.
4833680	4834680	There are people, yeah.
4834680	4835680	I mean, yes.
4835680	4839680	So, well, there's a core human problem.
4839680	4841680	We're a rich empire.
4841680	4846680	We have this like at least successfully illusory freedom, if not actual.
4846680	4849680	We have it pretty good.
4849680	4851680	So, we have these opinions.
4851680	4858680	And then you go, oh, am I defending the underdog if I say, hey, come on.
4858680	4859680	It was like that yesterday.
4859680	4860680	Give it a break.
4860680	4862680	Don't complicate it.
4862680	4865680	I make that guy sound like a teamster so he sounds wrong.
4865680	4867680	Unless I was at a union meeting.
4867680	4869680	And then they'd be like, yeah, that's all it's like.
4869680	4870680	No, they'd be like, fuck you.
4870680	4874680	You think that's what we sound like?
4874680	4879680	But if you also said like, hey, mine's going to be open, you know.
4879680	4881680	You know, you got to close my toss titty.
4881680	4882680	Welcome to America.
4882680	4885680	Love it or leave it.
4885680	4889680	I think that's like people don't know where to punch and where to deflect.
4889680	4892680	They don't know when they're the underdog and when they're the alpha.
4892680	4894680	You always feel like the underdog.
4894680	4898680	I always, you know, I don't have a point here.
4898680	4902680	It's just like when you're saying like, why don't you put pineapple on pizza?
4902680	4903680	Like, why wouldn't you?
4903680	4904680	Yeah, absolutely.
4904680	4906680	And then everyone's worried.
4906680	4910680	I think the fear is that if you put pineapple on pizza and like everyone keeps saying they
4910680	4915680	like it with nobody saying this is bullshit, that all of a sudden one day pineapple will
4915680	4917680	be part of pizza whether you like it or not.
4917680	4922680	I think that is the genuine fear, which is also kind of ridiculous.
4922680	4924680	I think that that is what the problem is.
4924680	4927680	That's the engine of humanity that people go like, well, what's next?
4927680	4930680	Book burning?
4931680	4933680	I'm not giving up mind comp.
4933680	4935680	You can't burn it.
4935680	4937680	It's the slippery pineapple slope.
4937680	4938680	Yeah.
4938680	4939680	All right.
4939680	4942680	So anyways, since we have you up there, why is everyone?
4942680	4945680	I mean, it's the answer is because you're good people.
4945680	4947680	Why are you talking?
4947680	4948680	It's hot.
4948680	4949680	All right.
4949680	4950680	It's hot.
4950680	4951680	It's really hot.
4951680	4952680	Are they just saying it's hot?
4952680	4953680	No, they're just all unhinged.
4953680	4955680	Is it like dogs panting?
4955680	4957680	It's hot so you just like say stuff?
4957680	4958680	That's what I'm saying.
4958680	4960680	I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show,
4960680	4962680	I'm gonna show, I'm gonna show.
4962680	4965680	I'm letting off a side of like a hot temperature.
4965680	4968680	Well, we got a lot of smart people up here, right?
4968680	4969680	Yeah.
4969680	4971680	So let's solve some problems.
4971680	4972680	Okay.
4972680	4973680	What would you rather fight?
4973680	4977680	A duck sized or 40 duck sized horses or a horse sized duck?
4977680	4978680	All right.
4978680	4979680	All right.
4979680	4982680	I would definitely fight what's the big one?
4982680	4984680	The horse sized duck.
4984680	4987680	So that's a duck the size of a horse.
4987680	4988680	Yeah.
4988680	4990680	That's, that's, that's no fucking problem.
4990680	4993680	Like you don't, you don't look, do you, do you want to fight?
4993680	4994680	Well, just hold on.
4994680	4997680	Do you want to fight the T-Rex or do you want to fight the Velociraptors?
4997680	4999680	If you've seen any Jurassic movie.
4999680	5000680	Exactly.
5000680	5003680	You know that the Velociraptors win.
5003680	5007680	You don't, you don't want to, you don't want a pack of something small and vicious
5007680	5009680	that can coordinate its attacks.
5009680	5011680	Yeah, but horses aren't vicious.
5011680	5013680	You want a single opponent.
5013680	5014680	You might want to fight a horse.
5014680	5017680	Even if it's a large duck, it's still a fucking duck.
5017680	5020680	Have you ever had a, have you ever had a duck shit in your mouth?
5020680	5021680	I have.
5021680	5024680	Like right in my goddamn mouth.
5024680	5025680	Why did that happen?
5025680	5027680	A horse sized duck shit.
5027680	5029680	That won't fit in your mouth.
5029680	5030680	Yeah, I don't know.
5030680	5033680	I'm not getting anywhere near that with an open mouth.
5033680	5034680	What's the, what are the two?
5034680	5035680	A horse sized duck.
5035680	5037680	Now, now Dan, that's a duck.
5037680	5038680	A size duck.
5038680	5040680	That's the size of a horse.
5040680	5041680	What's the other one?
5041680	5044680	40 duck sized horses.
5044680	5045680	40?
5045680	5046680	Oh Jesus.
5046680	5048680	Are they, are they the big ducks or the little ducks?
5048680	5049680	They're duck sized.
5049680	5052680	They're not like, oh, they're not the horse sized ducks.
5052680	5053680	No, no.
5053680	5057680	No, even, even four, I'd fight 40 horse sized horses.
5057680	5062680	They're timid herbivores that run when you say yeah.
5062680	5065680	A duck will kick your fucking ass.
5065680	5068680	Like it's angry waterfowl.
5068680	5070680	It has a huge territorial instinct.
5070680	5072680	Horses don't lay eggs.
5072680	5073680	They're not going to fuck you up.
5073680	5075680	They're going to run.
5075680	5076680	I agree.
5076680	5081680	If they're the size of ducks, I'm going to laugh while they're running.
5081680	5082680	Yeah.
5082680	5085680	I'm going to wave at them.
5085680	5088680	Unless they're the horse sized ducks.
5088680	5089680	That's true.
5089680	5090680	Yeah.
5090680	5097680	So what if it was, what if you had to fight a horse sized duck or 40 horse sized ducks?
5097680	5099680	Which would you take?
5099680	5100680	No, okay.
5100680	5103680	I would take the smaller, the small horses and I'll tell you why.
5103680	5110680	Because I already have a great technique for handling mobs of enemies.
5110680	5114680	And I think it applies just as well to horse sized, duck sized horses as it does to coyotes,
5114680	5115680	you know?
5115680	5117680	That's all I'm saying.
5117680	5120680	This is, this is my podcast technique.
5120680	5122680	Oh, no, I'm not going to show you.
5122680	5123680	Is it your running punch?
5123680	5129680	Well, if you, if you go to the sixlerfightsanimals.com and you can order my instructional videos,
5129680	5135680	where I teach you all the techniques, how to dodge coyotes with a backpack, how to take
5135680	5143680	on horses with carrots, how to take on sharks with an eyeball, all the classic techniques.
5143680	5145680	Sharks hate an eyeball.
5145680	5146680	No, they don't.
5146680	5147680	That's, that's the thing.
5147680	5149680	They've trusted and then you get them.
5149680	5150680	Exactly.
5150680	5152680	And then you get right in there.
5152680	5156680	Are they the spear, the spear sized eyeballs?
5156680	5158680	Sorry.
5158680	5161680	Juliana.
5161680	5162680	Get close.
5162680	5164680	Juliana.
5164680	5165680	Julie.
5165680	5166680	Juliana.
5166680	5167680	Juliana.
5167680	5172680	Who was your friend that said we got a black woman over here against pineapple?
5172680	5174680	That's my boyfriend.
5174680	5177680	First date, second date.
5177680	5182680	Our first date was actually with Harmontown, but this is, we've been together for six
5182680	5183680	months.
5183680	5186680	You seem kind of, you seem young enough that I can ask how old you are if you don't mind
5186680	5187680	telling us.
5187680	5189680	Oh, I'm 26.
5189680	5190680	Aww.
5190680	5193680	Little baby, big baby pumpkin.
5193680	5196680	He's, and he's, he's 49.
5196680	5198680	And I don't judge him.
5198680	5200680	I, I don't support him either.
5200680	5202680	I just, I'm just saying it's a jungle out there.
5202680	5204680	He's actually younger than me.
5204680	5205680	What's that?
5205680	5206680	He's actually younger than me.
5206680	5207680	Oh, nice.
5207680	5208680	I don't, why, why did I do that?
5208680	5209680	Why do I do that?
5209680	5212680	What is that instinct?
5212680	5216680	He's like, I'm going to get better.
5216680	5219680	I don't know what that, I don't even know who I, like, what is that?
5219680	5224680	That was like some kind of weird, like that's, okay.
5224680	5227680	I'm going to investigate that.
5227680	5229680	What, so you guys met at Harmontown?
5229680	5230680	Is that what you're saying?
5230680	5234680	No, we met in Long Beach, but our first date was here in Harmontown.
5235680	5239680	He asked me to be his girlfriend on Harmontown.
5239680	5241680	What do you mean, on Harmontown?
5241680	5243680	Well, we were here.
5243680	5246680	Wait, who's that guy?
5246680	5247680	Is that your boyfriend or is that?
5247680	5250680	Yeah, that's my boyfriend, the Asian one in the bag.
5250680	5252680	I can't see him, but I know it's there.
5252680	5255680	So while we were doing the show, is that what you see?
5255680	5259680	Yeah, he asked me and then I thought about it.
5259680	5262680	Never a good sign.
5263680	5268680	And then my rap was so good, like, if I had done one false move,
5268680	5271680	if I had had the wrong opinion about a Game of Thrones episode,
5271680	5273680	you would have gone one way or the other,
5273680	5281680	and instead you chose to make him the luckiest, the Long Beach,
5281680	5290680	the Harmontown fan in the three block radius for the next three to five months.
5291680	5294680	Statistics, same.
5298680	5302680	How was your life in L.A.? Can we ask you personal questions?
5302680	5304680	Yeah, sure, I can ask you personal questions.
5304680	5307680	What do you do for rent paying?
5307680	5311680	I work for, well, I used to work for the government and then...
5311680	5313680	What the fuck?
5315680	5319680	I don't even know if I could talk about it on here, but I feel like it's fine.
5319680	5323680	I used to work for them, but now I work at a medical office in Santa Monica,
5323680	5327680	which is, it's okay, but...
5327680	5329680	A medical office, like, so people come in and they go,
5329680	5331680	I might be sick at some point.
5331680	5334680	Yeah, they call in and they're like, we might be sick,
5334680	5336680	and I'm like, well, we don't have, maybe we should go to the...
5336680	5338680	We don't have the means to help you, but...
5338680	5340680	Maybe you should go to the emergency room,
5340680	5344680	and then they're like, no, I don't want to, and I'm like, uh, I don't know what I can...
5344680	5348680	So it's just a place that you tell them to go elsewhere?
5350680	5353680	I want to open up one of those.
5353680	5355680	Yeah, no.
5355680	5359680	It's not like that, but it's like, we mostly deal with primary care,
5359680	5365680	so if it's like a huge medical emergency, it's like, you definitely should go to an ER.
5365680	5368680	Some people come in and they go like, my hand is gone,
5368680	5373680	and you're like, well, I've got a stapler and a phone.
5373680	5375680	Hi, I don't have any problems.
5375680	5378680	Well, you've come to the right place.
5379680	5388680	Does it represent any kind of like, how close is this to your...
5388680	5392680	What's your fantasy about your career path, your vocation, your role?
5392680	5394680	I don't even want to pin you down.
5394680	5400680	Maybe you want to be the vapor of light, but like, what would you hope would happen
5400680	5404680	from your very limited time on this earth?
5404680	5408680	Well, I would like to be a doctor in the future.
5408680	5411680	All right, medical office seems like, yeah, it's like the mail room of probably,
5411680	5415680	I'm assuming, I don't know, my cartoonish understanding of the medical industry.
5415680	5419680	Here you go, doctor, there's three sick people for you today.
5419680	5421680	Boy, I stayed up all night sorting them.
5421680	5424680	I arranged them from sick to sickest.
5424680	5428680	Hope you have a great Father's Day.
5428680	5430680	A young man, what are these?
5430680	5434680	I'm not a young man, I'm a young black woman.
5434680	5442680	I just happen to talk like this because Dan Hyman can only understand young Jewish men in a mail room.
5442680	5448680	He was raised on 60s musicals.
5448680	5452680	There's some blackboard medical problem that she solved.
5452680	5459680	I didn't hear that, but what's your name again, Ralph?
5459680	5461680	Hunter.
5461680	5465680	Ralph was not a good guess.
5465680	5466680	All right, what do you do?
5466680	5467680	Hard to follow.
5467680	5468680	What do you do?
5468680	5469680	Computer, software engineer.
5469680	5470680	Boo.
5470680	5473680	Oh, sorry, I'm sorry.
5473680	5474680	That's awesome.
5474680	5478680	Computer, software, engineer, that sounded suspicious.
5478680	5481680	I don't believe that you have a job or...
5481680	5482680	No, yeah, I work.
5482680	5484680	You have to prove you're not a murderer.
5484680	5485680	What do you want me to say?
5485680	5487680	It's all about GPL.
5487680	5492680	No, I'll give him my own test to see if he's a murderer.
5492680	5497680	Let's say she's getting a bucket.
5497680	5499680	What does she put in it?
5499680	5501680	In what order?
5501680	5502680	Okay.
5502680	5506680	Let's say she has lotion.
5506680	5507680	Oh, now you...
5507680	5508680	Really?
5508680	5509680	Okay.
5509680	5510680	That's what tipped it in.
5510680	5512680	Okay, all right.
5512680	5514680	I feel like a fucking idiot.
5514680	5516680	All right.
5516680	5517680	That's a basket, right?
5517680	5518680	A basket.
5518680	5519680	A bucket.
5519680	5520680	It was a basket.
5520680	5521680	All right.
5521680	5522680	I'm on your side.
5522680	5523680	I'm a piece of shit.
5523680	5524680	Okay, thank you.
5524680	5527680	Well, that's better news than you think.
5527680	5528680	I didn't want to think that we could just...
5528680	5532680	There was some kind of weird gauze between a reference and going in the hoop.
5532680	5534680	I'm glad I had it fundamentally wrong.
5534680	5535680	Thank you.
5535680	5536680	All right.
5536680	5539680	So, it says you're going to need a bigger bus.
5539680	5544680	All right.
5544680	5546680	My name was Alon Horpo?
5546680	5547680	Hunter, yeah.
5547680	5548680	Okay.
5548680	5549680	Horpo.
5549680	5552680	It wasn't even a good guess.
5552680	5557680	I had to pass over Hunter to fake guess Horpo.
5557680	5560680	It's just bullying.
5560680	5562680	Because Hunter's a cool name.
5562680	5563680	Thanks, man.
5563680	5566680	I want to take it away from you.
5566680	5568680	It's a cool name.
5568680	5571680	It sounds literally like...
5571680	5572680	Like a hunter.
5572680	5573680	Yeah, sticking that too.
5573680	5583680	It's like if your name was Fireman.
5583680	5584680	Cheating is what it is.
5584680	5585680	It's cheating.
5585680	5587680	Your parents cheated.
5587680	5593680	Ah, Senator James Harmon.
5593680	5594680	Okay.
5594680	5597680	Well, what are you doing and what do you want to do?
5597680	5598680	Yeah.
5598680	5602680	So, right now I write computer software for a company out in Santa Monica.
5602680	5603680	Yeah.
5603680	5607680	And yeah, what I would want to do would be...
5607680	5609680	Shoot animals for some reason.
5609680	5610680	Shoot animals, yeah.
5610680	5613680	Or keep women in a huge hole in my basement.
5613680	5614680	Either one.
5614680	5618680	No, it's probably like teaching or like physics professor, something like that.
5618680	5619680	It might be fun.
5619680	5620680	Both teachers.
5620680	5621680	Yeah.
5621680	5622680	You would want to...
5622680	5625680	Specifically, you would want to teach science.
5625680	5629680	What if someone said you could be a teacher but you have to teach bubble gum?
5629680	5630680	I'd probably be okay.
5630680	5632680	I'd probably get to teach the shit out of bubble gum.
5632680	5633680	Really?
5633680	5636680	I mean, but really, that your passion for education is so high that you're like, yeah,
5636680	5637680	it's okay if it's not physics.
5637680	5638680	Yeah.
5638680	5639680	Yeah.
5639680	5641680	So, it's something that came across at work where you...
5641680	5642680	What if you had to teach racism?
5642680	5643680	Like, for...
5643680	5644680	Not awareness of it.
5644680	5647680	You had to teach how to be racist.
5647680	5649680	What if that form came through?
5649680	5650680	God damn it.
5650680	5653680	When are they going to give me the job I want?
5653680	5654680	I love physics.
5654680	5658680	It's like some vacuum tube pill comes through and just opens up racism.
5658680	5660680	No, I'm sorry.
5660680	5664680	I've gone off on my funny little flights of fancy.
5664680	5667680	Say what you were going to say before I forgot what was going on.
5667680	5669680	No, no, that's about it.
5669680	5671680	Yeah, I do computer software now.
5671680	5674680	I'd probably want to teach, but noggin' my hopes up.
5674680	5675680	All right.
5675680	5676680	And, yeah.
5676680	5677680	Glorietta, what are you doing?
5677680	5678680	Emily.
5678680	5679680	Emily?
5679680	5683680	I just jumped in.
5683680	5684680	I don't...
5684680	5685680	I don't...
5685680	5686680	I'm just bad.
5686680	5687680	I'm just a bad...
5687680	5688680	I don't...
5688680	5689680	Names and faces can't do it.
5689680	5690680	Ju...
5690680	5691680	Juilliard?
5691680	5695680	I loved you in that school.
5695680	5697680	Thank you, Hunter.
5697680	5698680	Hunter, right.
5698680	5701680	I was about to say doctor.
5701680	5705680	That's how fast it happens.
5705680	5707680	Okay.
5707680	5708680	Gwen...
5708680	5709680	Gwen.
5709680	5710680	Emily.
5710680	5711680	Diane.
5711680	5712680	Trisket.
5712680	5713680	Trisket.
5713680	5714680	Tr...
5714680	5715680	Travis Johnson.
5715680	5716680	The third.
5716680	5717680	Daphne.
5717680	5718680	Jennifer.
5718680	5719680	Har...
5719680	5720680	My name is Emily Carmichael.
5720680	5721680	Emily!
5721680	5722680	Emily!
5722680	5723680	Thank you.
5723680	5724680	Emily, what...
5724680	5725680	I stole your dress, by the way.
5725680	5726680	I've been in the red.
5726680	5727680	I mean, not your dress is awesome.
5727680	5728680	Awesome.
5728680	5729680	Stop it.
5729680	5730680	Beef.
5730680	5731680	Stop that.
5731680	5732680	Beef.
5732680	5733680	Oh, God.
5733680	5734680	This is what happened to me.
5734680	5735680	I'm so sorry.
5735680	5736680	I'm so sorry.
5736680	5737680	I'm so sorry.
5737680	5738680	I'm so sorry.
5738680	5739680	I'm so sorry.
5740680	5741680	Oh, God.
5741680	5742680	This is what happened to me.
5742680	5743680	It's a nightmare.
5743680	5744680	Oh, it is.
5744680	5749680	It's telling somebody you like their dress and then somebody else is upset.
5749680	5750680	Yeah.
5750680	5751680	You guys look awesome.
5751680	5752680	I'm not the ally you want.
5752680	5753680	You guys look awesome.
5753680	5754680	You both look awesome.
5754680	5757680	You both look really good.
5757680	5759680	I saw what happened there and I was immediately...
5759680	5760680	I was like, that's me.
5760680	5761680	That's...
5761680	5766680	All right.
5766680	5774680	So, Cora.
5774680	5775680	What are you doing?
5775680	5776680	What do you want to do?
5776680	5781680	In any order, at any length, in any accent from Norwegian to Spanish?
5781680	5782680	Just kidding.
5782680	5783680	And the last part?
5783680	5785680	Just a little drunk.
5785680	5786680	What are you doing?
5786680	5787680	What do you want to do?
5787680	5792680	I direct future films and I want to direct future films.
5793680	5794680	Privilege.
5794680	5796680	Privilege.
5796680	5798680	You have everything.
5798680	5802680	Why don't you go yell at bartenders?
5802680	5804680	Dream follower.
5804680	5806680	Industry hack.
5806680	5809680	Kill the realizer of dream.
5809680	5813680	I have a totally unrelated thing, which is that there is a person in this audience who
5813680	5817680	I'm not going to look at because I don't want to make them feel called out.
5817680	5821680	But there is somebody in this audience who's just watching this show with just a bottle
5821680	5824680	of Jameson at their foot.
5824680	5826680	And can that person help me?
5826680	5828680	Does that person have a cup?
5828680	5830680	Does that person want to share?
5830680	5831680	Well, we've got cups up here.
5831680	5832680	Again, not looking...
5832680	5833680	Again, I didn't...
5833680	5836680	You know, if you wanted to just sit that one out, you could have done that.
5836680	5839680	You didn't have to, like, name yourself.
5839680	5842680	That was just a freebie, you know?
5842680	5844680	I will help.
5844680	5845680	Everybody, this is Annie.
5845680	5846680	She's helpful.
5846680	5847680	I'm not going to forget.
5847680	5848680	She's a mansplain.
5848680	5849680	Annie.
5850680	5852680	Do you need help with that, Annie?
5852680	5854680	Are you even blind that I'm disabled?
5854680	5855680	Oh!
5855680	5856680	Different!
5856680	5857680	Different!
5857680	5859680	Different able!
5859680	5861680	Whereas I don't see any kind of...
5861680	5862680	Annie!
5862680	5867680	Annie, would you like to come up to the stage and tell us about yourself?
5867680	5869680	Holy shit!
5869680	5871680	She's sub-hosting!
5871680	5873680	I love it.
5873680	5874680	But I like it.
5874680	5875680	Yes, keep sub-hosting.
5875680	5876680	You're doing good.
5876680	5877680	Thank you so much.
5877680	5878680	Annie, come!
5878680	5880680	Annie, it would be nice to ask you a couple questions.
5880680	5881680	We haven't seen you in a while.
5881680	5882680	Do you need help?
5882680	5883680	Okay.
5883680	5884680	There you go.
5886680	5889680	What happens when you ask?
5889680	5890680	Here.
5890680	5891680	You sit down.
5891680	5892680	I'll get to you.
5892680	5896680	Let's give a hand to Dr. Horpo.
5900680	5902680	Dr. Horpo.
5902680	5904680	It's just for you keeping score.
5904680	5909680	The pro-pineapple people, much more inclusive and open-minded.
5909680	5911680	We're clearly just like, fuck everyone.
5911680	5912680	Yeah.
5913680	5916680	I don't want you to lump you in with me, but it's all I got.
5916680	5919680	All I'm saying is double pepperoni, bacon, and pineapple.
5919680	5920680	Amazing.
5920680	5921680	I bet that sounds good.
5921680	5923680	Wait, Canadian bacon or bacon bacon?
5923680	5924680	No, bacon bacon.
5924680	5925680	Okay, I'm on board.
5925680	5927680	I'm very glad I asked you on to the stage.
5927680	5931680	Smokiness of bacon and then the pepperoni and the spiciness and the pineapple.
5931680	5932680	Oh my God.
5933680	5935680	I am a little high and drunk myself.
5935680	5936680	Okay.
5936680	5938680	I feel like more for my brain.
5938680	5940680	I always picture you as kind of a clean cut.
5940680	5941680	Did I cause this in you?
5941680	5944680	Are you just a high drunk person now because you listen to the podcast?
5944680	5945680	Oh, definitely not.
5945680	5946680	Okay.
5946680	5947680	Okay.
5947680	5948680	Thank you.
5948680	5949680	Yeah.
5949680	5950680	You did not corrupt me in any way, shape or form.
5950680	5953680	But I did take you from a walker to a cane, right?
5953680	5955680	I cured your spinal stenosis.
5955680	5956680	Yes.
5956680	5958680	That was entirely you're doing, Dan.
5959680	5961680	As long as we're being scientific.
5961680	5964680	I was like, oh my God.
5964680	5968680	I am no longer disabled because Dan has shown me the way.
5968680	5969680	Yes.
5969680	5970680	Thank you.
5970680	5972680	Wait, are you disabled?
5972680	5973680	Yes.
5973680	5974680	Yes, I am.
5974680	5975680	Okay.
5975680	5976680	How does that work?
5976680	5977680	My spine is collapsing.
5977680	5978680	It doesn't.
5978680	5979680	Yeah.
5979680	5984680	I know it was hard because the last time you tried to talk to me was at South by Southwest
5984680	5985680	when we couldn't hear anything.
5985680	5986680	Yeah.
5986680	5987680	It was a nightmare.
5987680	5988680	It was a nightmare episode.
5988680	5997680	But yeah, that's for new viewers or whoever, real Annie is like, well, I don't know how
5997680	5998680	to qualify it.
5998680	6004680	But huge community fan, particularly of Annie's character, had a blog, how to dress like Annie.
6004680	6008680	Anniedresseslikethis.org.edu slash Annie.
6008680	6010680	I saw that.
6010680	6011680	Annie's clothes.
6011680	6012680	I saw that.
6012680	6013680	Yeah.
6013680	6015680	It didn't go far.
6016680	6019680	At South by, it was like a walker, right?
6019680	6020680	Yeah.
6020680	6021680	Because you have spinal stenosis.
6021680	6022680	Like this page.
6022680	6023680	Yeah.
6023680	6025680	I have degenerative spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease.
6025680	6032680	And now I also have arthritis in my upper spine as well as collapsing discs in my thoraxes.
6032680	6034680	Well, you needed humbling.
6034680	6035680	Yeah.
6035680	6038680	The spinal stenosis was going to your head.
6038680	6041680	I found myself thinking, boy, she needs to be taken down a peg.
6041680	6042680	I hope she gets arthritis.
6042680	6043680	It's true.
6043680	6046680	The arthritis really did it for me.
6046680	6049680	You finally thought, maybe, you know what, I should clean up my act.
6049680	6050680	Yeah.
6050680	6054680	Well, how did you go from a walker to a cane?
6054680	6061680	Because I said to myself, well, self, I don't like this walker.
6061680	6062680	Right.
6062680	6063680	And it was actually starting.
6063680	6066680	So my arthritis was spreading up into my neck.
6066680	6070680	And it was starting to spread into my shoulders.
6070680	6074680	And I asked my doctor, why is that?
6074680	6080680	And he said one of the reasons that is is because when you walk on a walker, you kind
6080680	6083680	of have to push down on it a little bit.
6083680	6084680	Right.
6084680	6089680	And so when you're walking forward, you sort of give it this pressure.
6089680	6091680	You're hunching forward, kind of.
6091680	6092680	Exactly.
6092680	6093680	You were using your walker as a crutch.
6093680	6094680	Right.
6094680	6098680	And they called you out on it.
6098680	6099680	Exactly.
6099680	6103680	It's like you need it to help you walk or something.
6103680	6108680	So I said, fuck that.
6108680	6114680	And which is not unlike what I said to Dan, if any of you remember that episode.
6114680	6117680	It's the same exact way she said it.
6117680	6118680	Exactly.
6118680	6122680	And so I just said, OK, I'm going to start using my cane more.
6122680	6126680	And so what the doctor said was, and this is probably the best thing I've ever heard
6126680	6130680	in my life, was, if you're going to use your cane more, you're going to have to
6130680	6132680	take more pain pills.
6132680	6136680	And I'm like, wait a minute, why was I not doing this sooner?
6136680	6137680	What's the downside?
6137680	6139680	Yeah.
6139680	6143680	Can my cane be one of those Christmas canes filled with the pain pills?
6143680	6148680	Right.
6148680	6152680	I'm like, if I get rid of it, do I get more?
6152680	6153680	Is it a reward system?
6153680	6155680	Right.
6155680	6160680	It's like those billboards for AIDS where it says, would you rather wear one of these
6160680	6161680	or take all these pills?
6161680	6163680	I'm like, pills?
6163680	6164680	Yeah.
6164680	6165680	Are you crazy?
6165680	6168680	I'm like, was this a hard question?
6168680	6170680	I was actually, I've been taking one drug.
6170680	6177680	And he says, oh, my doctor said, well, my physical medicine doctor said, oh, you could
6177680	6181680	also be taking this pill, which makes you lose weight automatically.
6181680	6185680	And I said, why didn't you give me that in the first place?
6185680	6187680	Why didn't she give me that in the first place?
6187680	6188680	Right.
6188680	6191680	I was like, what made you take a year to give me this?
6191680	6194680	I mean, it just was unbelievable.
6194680	6199680	This one attacks your pain, but the side effects are heightened IQ.
6199680	6200680	Right.
6200680	6202680	Super jumping.
6202680	6206680	And pineapples on pizza.
6206680	6209680	Ability to, you'll have a portable hole.
6209680	6210680	Look it up.
6210680	6212680	It's a D&D thing.
6212680	6214680	A bag of holding.
6214680	6217680	Don't put them in each other.
6217680	6218680	Unbelievable.
6218680	6219680	No.
6219680	6222680	Unless you want to level a castle.
6222680	6224680	I think about that from time to time.
6224680	6225680	It happens.
6225680	6228680	Julie, you've been awfully quiet.
6228680	6235680	I'll give you one minute to be for or against Annie's health.
6235680	6236680	I'm kidding.
6236680	6243680	It's so easy to be negative.
6243680	6246680	Does that mean current health or eventual health?
6246680	6247680	I don't know.
6247680	6253680	My joke obviously was that I'm a terrible host, and I don't know what I'm doing.
6253680	6262680	What do you guys think about all this war?
6262680	6263680	We got 10 minutes.
6263680	6265680	It's fine.
6265680	6266680	Okay.
6266680	6267680	Guns.
6267680	6276680	Hey, why don't we talk about your girlfriend's titties?
6276680	6282680	That sounds like an urban disc, but what he means is that my girlfriend, and she said
6282680	6286680	it was okay to tell about it.
6286680	6287680	This happens every day to everybody.
6287680	6291680	She found a little lump, and it was like, so we spent that weird lump scare, and she
6292680	6294680	went in and got a mammogram.
6294680	6298680	I had seen videos of it, and she was texting me, like, man, they smashed your boob like
6298680	6300680	a tortilla.
6300680	6307680	How many women, I don't know, I guess, well, I still don't even know what the rules are
6307680	6308680	about that.
6308680	6310680	Who's got a mammogram?
6310680	6312680	Applaud if you got a mammogram.
6312680	6313680	Oh, my God.
6313680	6314680	That's so weird.
6314680	6318680	Well, I'm not hearing a lot of applause, but that might mean, I don't know if that means
6318680	6319680	...
6320680	6323680	I don't want to give them to older women unless you're particularly susceptible to
6323680	6325680	cancer and or bizarre illness.
6325680	6326680	I don't understand that.
6326680	6327680	Mash it.
6327680	6328680	Have you had one?
6328680	6329680	Yeah.
6329680	6330680	Why have you had one?
6330680	6336680	I had a tumor in my ovaries, which got removed, and so they were like ...
6336680	6337680	And so they're just looking everywhere.
6337680	6339680	Check these out, yeah.
6339680	6343680	And they mash your boobie on a ... I saw a video of it.
6343680	6348680	Yeah, they put those two metal plates, and then they just, they really are trying to
6348680	6353680	work together, and the bigger your boobies are, the more it hurts.
6353680	6358680	It was funny, because people would think, oh, the smaller they are, the worse it would
6358680	6359680	be.
6359680	6360680	Opposite is true.
6360680	6361680	It's very wrong.
6361680	6362680	I would have thought that, too.
6362680	6363680	How do you know?
6363680	6367680	Have you tried having smaller breasts when you got one?
6367680	6374680	I did it for a little while in the 90s, and I was like, that is not for me.
6374680	6375680	I mean, it was the 90s.
6375680	6376680	We all were.
6377680	6380680	Yeah, every girl's had little tits at some point.
6380680	6381680	Yeah.
6381680	6383680	I don't recommend it, honestly.
6383680	6384680	I do.
6384680	6387680	Double deep breasts, that's the best.
6387680	6388680	I hate mine.
6388680	6391680	Are you familiar with the itty bitty chitty committee?
6391680	6392680	I am.
6392680	6399680	They're an offshoot of the Bilderberg group, and it's said that they run the Eye of Horace,
6399680	6403680	which is a plot of ... Now you see me one, and they ...
6403680	6408680	At the end of that movie, they go into a glowing carousel.
6408680	6410680	I don't care.
6410680	6417680	God is spoiled by this movie, and you will still ... I'm telling you, the good guys evaporate
6417680	6420680	into a magical mist, and now they're going to do a second one.
6420680	6426680	Are they going to be like, whoa, we're trans-dimensional magician robbers.
6426680	6428680	Oh, help, help.
6428680	6430680	My cart broke down.
6431680	6434680	Anyways, I can't wait.
6434680	6435680	I can't wait.
6435680	6439680	Now you don't is what it should be called, but you can't call it that.
6439680	6444680	I think that when the first one came out, everyone was like, now you see me.
6444680	6445680	No, I didn't.
6445680	6450680	So then they couldn't go that way if they wanted to, because that joke was already there
6450680	6451680	undoing.
6451680	6457680	Well, flying in the face of the theory that shame would stop them from doing anything
6457680	6461680	is every frame of the movie you're describing.
6461680	6465680	So the mammogram came out okay.
6465680	6472680	I think it's cool you said, yeah, it hurts, but now I feel like I'm a guy who has a podcast
6472680	6479680	that had a girl ... I was like, can you also say it didn't hurt that much?
6479680	6480680	No.
6480680	6483680	What's your agenda for that?
6483680	6487680	I don't want to be the guy that helped the platform of mammogram fear.
6487680	6494680	Well, I mean, it's not like it's one of those things where it doesn't matter whether or
6494680	6495680	not it hurts.
6495680	6497680	You want to get the mammogram.
6497680	6503680	Do you know what is the current party line of it?
6503680	6508680	Is it that you're supposed to self-check and then the mammogram is if you find a lump?
6508680	6509680	Is that the idea?
6509680	6510680	Yeah.
6510680	6516680	You're supposed to do it in the shower and then you go in circles around your breasts
6516680	6518680	while you're in the shower.
6518680	6519680	Very sensual.
6519680	6520680	I mean ...
6520680	6524680	And then you're supposed to ... they actually, when you're in high school, or at least when
6524680	6531680	I was in high school, they gave us this fake tiny breast and then it ... the fake tiny breast
6531680	6532680	had two lumps.
6532680	6536680	One lump you could feel and the other lump you could not feel.
6536680	6538680	Oh, like the princess and the pea.
6538680	6539680	Right.
6540680	6546680	The female hero's journeys are about sensitivity.
6546680	6549680	This woman could bitch about anything.
6549680	6553680	She's the King Arthur of our ... of her gender.
6553680	6559680	I'm obviously being ironic and saying I'm on your side.
6559680	6560680	So the purpose ...
6560680	6562680	You should have had better hero's journeys than that.
6562680	6568680	So the purpose of the lump you could not feel was that it meant that's why you need to get
6568680	6569680	men.
6569680	6572680	Oh, they were like ... it was like a shitty like Kobayashi Maru like ...
6572680	6573680	Yes.
6573680	6574680	Exactly.
6574680	6577680	Like what sound ... why didn't you pick the finger?
6577680	6579680	I was going to pick my own finger.
6579680	6583680	Oh, Willow of good, you should be a wizard.
6583680	6585680	So Willow is the movie.
6585680	6586680	Yes.
6586680	6587680	Well played.
6587680	6588680	Okay.
6588680	6589680	All right.
6589680	6590680	Breast ... check your breasts.
6590680	6593680	The mammogram came out all right.
6593680	6595680	But here's the thing about balls.
6595680	6597280	I love balls.
6597280	6601280	You don't get to draw a circle around your balls in a steamy shower.
6601280	6602280	That sounded hot.
6602280	6604480	Like that's not what you do when you check your balls.
6604480	6605480	No.
6605480	6606480	Like the guys ...
6606480	6607480	Oh, you're doing them all alone.
6607480	6609480	Well, they're more sensitive, right?
6609480	6613920	Well, it's like ... there's art on the college stall.
6613920	6620200	That's the first ... when in my day when you encountered ball checking like mythology.
6620200	6623560	No one teaches it until you're in college in my day.
6623560	6628980	And there's a diagram when you get to college and it's just like these ... the thumb and
6628980	6633520	forefinger and it's just like to do that to a ball.
6633520	6635560	And they're suggesting that you do that in the shower.
6635560	6637640	It looks like fucking pogs.
6637640	6639680	Like it looks like tiddlywinks is being played.
6639680	6642360	Like it just looks like a ... I'm not doing it.
6642360	6643360	Wow.
6643360	6644840	I will not mush my ball like that.
6644840	6646840	That doesn't sound pleasant.
6646840	6647840	No.
6647840	6651280	I mean, now I feel like you're patronizing me.
6651280	6652280	I love balls.
6653000	6654000	Oh, thank God.
6654000	6655000	Thank God.
6655000	6656000	No, no, no.
6656000	6657000	She seems sincere.
6657000	6658000	Yeah, she seems sincere.
6658000	6661000	The pain of that balls go through.
6661000	6662800	So that does not sound pleasant.
6662800	6665760	Yeah, but now I feel bad, though.
6665760	6666760	Yeah.
6666760	6667760	I'm not complaining of it.
6667760	6668760	My spine's just collapsing.
6668760	6669760	Why do you tell you have balls?
6669760	6670760	Ah, goddamn it.
6670760	6678920	So you were disappointed that your girlfriend didn't have cancer?
6678920	6682040	No, no.
6682040	6687400	She's compacting a very, very long, complicated story that was like ... I love Cody so much
6687400	6691360	that it was like an ... I was trying to explain this to my therapist, and I said to her, I'd
6691360	6694240	never say this out loud ... Oh, really?
6694240	6695240	Because it's complicated.
6695240	6696240	I thought we were going to tell this story.
6696240	6697240	I was trying to express a thing.
6697240	6699480	It's not like, why would you bring this up?
6699480	6701160	Because you said we were going to talk about it.
6701160	6702240	Well, no, I never said that.
6702240	6706240	I didn't say I'd like to talk about this aspect of it, but it was like, it's hard to explain.
6706240	6710840	It was like, I found out I love my girlfriend so much that I was like kind of like part
6710840	6715080	of my brain was like stoked about proving it.
6715080	6720400	She was a little disappointed too, right?
6720400	6721400	Yeah, I don't know.
6721400	6723440	But it's like, it's not a thing to talk about.
6723440	6725040	Like I'd say, this is a private thing.
6725040	6726040	It's like, I don't know.
6726040	6728200	It's like complicated, but I mean, I'm okay.
6728200	6730680	Sorry, I broke your no rules.
6730680	6738000	If it was 8.15, I'd be like, okay, yeah, let's make the episode about this.
6738000	6739340	I want to make this understandable.
6739340	6748180	It might not be something to talk about, but is it something to rap about?
6748180	6749180	Best Comptroller ever.
6749180	6750180	Oh, I got this.
6750180	6761180	I got a song and everything.
6761180	6762180	Yo.
6762180	6763180	Yo.

6777740	6778740	all of your models.
6778740	6779740	What?
6779740	6780740	Oh, excuse me for a second.
6780740	6781740	What the fuck?
6781740	6782740	Yeah.

6789740	6790740	Yeah.
6790740	6791740	Yeah.
6791740	6792740	Yeah.
6793740	6794740	All right.
6794740	6795740	All right.
6795740	6796740	That's cool.
6796740	6797740	All right.
6797740	6798740	All right.
6798740	6799740	That's cool.
6799740	6800740	All right.
6800740	6801740	Our rapping turned Janessa.
6801740	6802740	All right.
6802740	6803740	Don't get discouraged.
6803740	6804740	Yo.
6804740	6805740	Yo.
6805740	6806740	Yo.
6806740	6807740	Thank you.
6807740	6808740	Take it from the one.
6808740	6809740	Okay.
6809740	6810740	Yo.
6810740	6811740	One.
6811740	6812740	One.
6812740	6813740	Two.
6813740	6814740	One.
6814740	6815740	One.
6815740	6816740	Two.
6816740	6817740	One.
6817740	6818740	One.
6818740	6819740	Two.
6819740	6820740	I got a one and it's going in my shoe.
6820740	6821740	I got a sock and you know what to do.
6821740	6824260	Watch the shoe to my sock.
6824260	6831100	I go out and I find a sizable rock and I put my foot on it.
6831100	6833980	I sit there for six hours and write a sonnet.
6833980	6837980	I say, yo, your face is like a comet.
6837980	6839700	I fucked your mama so hard.
6839700	6840700	I made her vomit.
6840700	6843700	I wanted fucking Anna, me, Wallace, Gromit.
6843700	6845700	I'm going to do it.
6845700	6851700	If you, Jerry, and Tomet, I'm going to fuck you so hard, I'm going to glom it on two
6851700	6852700	two.
6852700	6856100	Why am I trying to do that thing where you repeat the rhyme a million times?
6856100	6857700	Those people write those things for hours.
6857700	6858700	It's overambitious.
6858700	6862420	Fuck your mama so hard her pussy needed flowers.
6862420	6864700	That's a funeral laying it on her grave.
6864700	6866700	Fuck your mama so hard.
6866700	6874700	Her life was mine to save, gave it CPR, gave it ABC, gave it 222, and this is TLC.
6874700	6875700	Give it MP3.
6875700	6876700	What?
6876700	6877700	What?
6877700	6878700	Just some suggestions.
6878700	6879700	There's a ghost in there.
6880700	6881700	Don't get discouraged.
6882700	6885700	Harpet Town is the place where rap was born.
6885700	6888700	I fucked your mama so hard her sheep got shorn.
6888700	6891700	I put razors inside her barn.
6891700	6895700	I fucked your mama so hard she told a motherfucking yarn.
6897700	6900700	That's it for the show.
6900700	6907700	Some of you should really think about yourselves tonight.
6907700	6914700	Let's have a hand for Henrietta, Goblet, Goblet, Goblet, Goblet.
6914700	6919700	Annie, Helen, Mora, Trisket, Gloriana, and Juliana.
