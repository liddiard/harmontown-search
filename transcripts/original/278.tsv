0	17240	From fantastic Uptown Burbank, Harman Town is now in session.
17240	22280	Let's put your groovy chicken hands together for the Game Master extraordinaire, Mr. Spencer
22280	24280	Crittenden.
24280	27280	Hell yeah!
27280	34280	Spencer's going to do a little freestyle for us to start the show off.
34280	41280	Hey guys, it's me, Spencer M.C.
41280	45280	I'm going to rap really slow.
45280	53280	If I do that and I keep the flow, that's all I've got, I think.
54280	58280	I think I really am bad at rapping.
58280	63280	Put your hands together out there in podcast land for the Mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan
63280	64280	Herman!
64280	67280	Oh yeah!
67280	68280	Thank you.
68280	69280	The Kotlin has been dropped.
69280	71280	Did you hear that freestyle?
71280	73280	Yeah, I couldn't hear all of it.
73280	74280	It was fierce.
74280	76280	I felt like it was good.
76280	78280	I felt like it was good enough to get us going.
78280	81280	There might have to be a slow rap battle right now.
81280	83280	Yeah, I think we got it.
83280	85280	Spencer wanted us out.
85280	86280	Cut that shit.
86280	88280	Oh, you scared!
88280	89280	You running scared!
89280	92280	Yeah, the refusal of a call, man.
92280	95280	You running from my slow fire.
95280	100280	I got no problem admitting that.
100280	102280	We've heard my rapping the last six months.
102280	106280	I mean, not that it was better before that, but now it's gotten bad and sterile.
106280	107280	I like it.
107280	113280	It used to be interesting that I was a surgeon that worked with a rusty spoon, and then
113280	120280	I washed and cleaned the spoon and replaced it with one from Target, creatively speaking.
120280	121280	It's still good.
121280	124280	Don't mean to offend any Target employees out there.
124280	125280	Fight for 15.
125280	126280	Minimum wage.
126280	127280	Socialism.
127280	130280	Let's all share money until we die.
130280	132280	Just not mine.
133280	138280	Hope you're in the mood for a bad show tonight.
138280	141280	What are you going to do, take your business elsewhere?
141280	146280	No, I'm going to go give $5 a month to...
146280	147280	How could it be bad?
147280	149280	We got so many good things.
149280	155280	No, we got great things, but I said bad to be facetious.
155280	157280	And self kind of deprecating.
158280	162280	What I really meant in my head was kind of a sleepy show, a low energy show.
162280	163280	Okay.
163280	165280	I'm not feeling...
165280	169280	Remember when I was all excited about Killer Bees and going into the lake?
169280	171280	Oh, would that we could go back to then.
171280	177280	By the way, some guy tweeted a multiple tweet story about how a friend of his...
177280	183280	He's named after his best friend's dad who died in a bee attack.
183280	186280	They found him drowned with bees in his throat.
187280	195280	He didn't say this directly, but I'm going to go ahead and assume that he was trying to in your face us, like a bee.
195280	197280	He was trying to save your life.
197280	200280	No, he was trying to say, I got you.
200280	202280	I'm the guy you're looking for.
202280	207280	I'm the guy at the story about a bee attack where someone died because they jumped in water.
207280	208280	Doesn't work.
208280	213280	And like I told the guy on Twitter, look, you brought your friend's dad's ghost into the courtroom.
213280	216280	So I'm not being insensitive to his life.
216280	219280	I want your friend and his dad to be respected.
219280	225280	But since he's exhibit A, I have to be clinical about it and say, this doesn't prove anything.
225280	236280	I know that if Killer Bees are chasing you and you jump into water, they may be able to wait for you, monitor your carbon dioxide bubbles.
236280	243280	And when you stick your head above water, fly into your nose and mouth, sting you and effectively kill you.
243280	257280	Like Jason Voorhees in the deleted scene of the Derek Mears version, where Jason Voorhees just stands outside Crystal Lake so that the woman who's trying to get away from him by swimming, she just slowly drowns.
257280	258280	He's walking around.
258280	261280	Yeah, she just keeps swimming to each side of Crystal Lake.
261280	266280	And then Jason just walks around the lake and watches her drown.
266280	269280	He's like a one man beehive.
269280	272280	Did they edit that out of the movie?
272280	277280	I remember seeing that where he I remember Derek, Derek describing that to me.
277280	285280	And I was like, this confirms that this Friday, the 13th reboot will be not the final chapter because it sounds awesome.
285280	287280	Someone thought of that.
287280	288280	I like that.
288280	295280	I like it when brutality isn't just torture porn, when it's more like, I guess that kind of is torture porn.
295280	297280	Let's think of a new way to kill a lady.
297280	298280	All right.
298280	300280	Well, I guess that franchise deserved to die.
300280	301280	OK.
301280	303280	My friend could have gotten more work.
303280	305280	Did you watch any of those Winter Olympics, Dan?
305280	306280	Yeah.
306280	307280	What?
307280	309280	Which ones?
309280	311280	I like the figure skating.
311280	312280	Yeah.
312280	314280	Why?
314280	315280	The spinning.
315280	317280	The triumph of the human will.
317280	318280	Yeah.
318280	320280	Sports corner.
320280	325280	Winter Olympics edition, 2018 beyond change.
325280	329280	Dan's going to get a sports corner in that thing.
329280	334280	Hey, Olympics.
334280	335280	Yeah.
335280	336280	Figure skating.
336280	338280	Look, I'm not going to.
338280	348280	I know it's 2018, and Dan Harmon hasn't had a year where anyone's going to him for opinions about what's sexually titillating.
348280	350280	I'm not a popular source of that information.
350280	356280	It's no longer charming for me to talk about the things that make me excited.
356280	359280	Are you allowed to like what you like without crossing a line?
359280	361280	No, it's just not charismatic.
361280	363280	I know I'm allowed to do all kinds of stuff.
363280	369280	I know that's not really what's for sale with me, but you brought it up.
369280	379280	Look, female figure skating outfits are how I wish everyone dressed in normal life.
379280	380280	Whoa.
380280	381280	Even you?
381280	382280	Sure.
382280	383280	I'll do anything.
383280	385280	Yeah.
385280	387280	It's very 80s.
387280	391280	I have the gauzy little skirts and obviously.
391280	397280	But it's interesting because I look at the outfits and the outfits are titillating, but it truly is.
397280	408280	It clearly is also the motion, the grace, the things that are difficult that somehow are also, it makes the person beautiful.
408280	411280	So you keep going back and forth.
411280	417280	Since you guys are subscribers and no one else is going to hear this, I will tell you I did try to masturbate to figure skating this year.
417280	419280	Just to see if I could.
419280	420280	You tried unsuccessfully?
420280	423280	Well, I mean, I didn't like stay on it.
423280	427280	I ended up going to Pornhub Premium and typing figure skating.
427280	430280	Just because I was like, well, wait a minute.
430280	437280	I was trying to masturbate to women's biathlon when they ski and shoot, but the NBC keeps going to commercial.
437280	439280	Oh, yeah.
439280	447280	As long as we're objectifying Olympians, it's interesting the curling.
447280	451280	Everybody's crazy about the Korean curlers and the guys.
451280	454280	The US men's team won the whole kaboodle.
454280	457280	But there's also the Swedish curlers.
457280	461280	Now I'm in territory where maybe Cody could get upset.
461280	468280	I think she can't get upset me talking about outfits on figure skaters, so I don't want to go into the Swedish curling team.
469280	471280	We're talking about the men's or women's.
471280	472280	Let's say the men.
472280	473280	Okay.
473280	475280	Get me out of this doghouse.
475280	476280	All right, let's move on.
476280	479280	Now, while we're talking about curling outfits, I was very excited.
479280	487280	I was in Canada when the gold medal bout was happening between the US and was it the Swiss, I believe?
487280	489280	I think it was the Swiss team.
489280	490280	It was the Swiss.
490280	494280	And I was so happy that the men won because they'd never won and Canada has never lost.
494280	501280	It was the first Olympics where Canada didn't get a medal in curling or hockey for the men.
501280	502280	And I was very excited.
502280	508280	And then I was talking to church and two of the guys had red ball caps on.
508280	512280	One guy's was the bill was rounded like a ball player.
512280	516280	The other guy's was kind of flat, like kind of a magga, like Trumpy hat.
516280	525280	And I kind of put a little bit of like I spent, I think the hours between one and two a.m. and Vancouver,
525280	530280	Googling and searching through Twitter to see if the men's curling team were Trumpys.
533280	536280	I don't want to ask the curling questions that everybody asks.
536280	537280	Why is it a sport?
537280	542280	Like why, since it is a sport, why hasn't anyone gotten so good at putting the puck where it belongs
542280	545280	that you actually need sweepy people to guide it to its spot?
545280	547280	Wouldn't it be the best strategy of all?
547280	548280	It makes it hurt.
548280	553280	You put a little spin on it and the stone starts to curl, but the sweeping can speed it up
553280	555280	and actually give it a little kind of furrow to go into.
555280	557280	You can give it like left or right angle.
557280	561280	You could say all of these things about a dart in the air.
561280	566280	Like it's not part of darts that a helicopter comes down and like lassows the dart or someone blows on it.
566280	570280	It's not part of shuffleboard that someone like oils the path in front of the shuffleboard puck.
571280	576280	Why is curling not just a person that doesn't know what a freeze or a draw or a draw weight?
576280	582280	Like I said, I'd be a total hypocrite to suggest that something's more Olympic than something else.
582280	583280	I don't care.
583280	586280	If the kids are having a good time, I'm happy for them.
586280	587280	Curling.
587280	589280	It's really about the yardage.
589280	593280	But I am kind of surprised.
593280	596280	It's about the figure skating too.
596280	597280	All about the yardage.
597280	599280	Do you think that figure skating will ever be?
599280	609280	I'm such a pervert about my figure skating that I almost feel like I'm causing trouble for myself by bringing it up.
609280	613280	But you can't help but sit there in these changing times and watch figure skating and go,
613280	616280	this seems like a bit of a throwback at this point.
616280	620280	A throwback for which I am eternally grateful.
620280	627280	But isn't it kind of actually remarkable that no one's come in and gone,
627280	629280	put some pants on these women, for God's sakes.
629280	632280	We see the guys can skate in pants.
632280	635280	Why don't we keep dressing them like playboy bunnies?
635280	639280	Well, I don't think any sport that's inspired a hit is up for a revision.
639280	641280	Yeah, it's worth a lot of money.
641280	646280	But it's probably also, it'll be slow to change because of the amount of discipline.
646280	650280	No one's changed how ballet dancers carry themselves.
651280	661280	It's such a difficult honor to become a ballet dancer that no one along the way is going to allow themselves
661280	666280	to be distracted by questions about whether they should be doing this thing that they've been doing since they've been three years old.
666280	667280	It is crazy.
667280	672280	I mean, I've heard that there's something called the quad jump that's changing up the figure skating game.
672280	678280	Yeah, the, forget her name, US figure skater landed the first quad in women's.
678280	681280	She's the only woman's figure skater that's landed the quad.
681280	682280	Something like that.
682280	683280	I will say it.
683280	688280	This is the year that I finally, I think it's part of it's like getting middle age, like maybe hormones have tapered enough
688280	695280	that I really am just noticing how beautiful, how graceful, you know, I'm like appreciative of the actual discipline.
695280	699280	And like probably also just like, well, these Olympics only happen in whatever decade.
699280	700280	What is it?
700280	701280	Four years.
701280	702280	Something like that.
702280	705280	Well, two years per summer winter, but four years per event.
705280	706280	Four year Olympia.
706280	707280	Okay.
707280	711280	So four years ago, I was, I was a real douche.
711280	712280	Yeah.
712280	715280	But, and I was probably just still just like, that's hot.
715280	718280	You hadn't even thought about how, how to apologize.
718280	722280	But now I'm, well, I still am, but now I'm like, that's hot plus poetry.
722280	723280	Because of grace.
723280	724280	Yeah.
724280	725280	Right.
725280	726280	But that is the sport.
726280	733280	Like that, that gracefulness, like, I mean, you know, the, like you said, it's like ballet, but like that is, you know, that's, that's, I think what the judges are looking for and stuff.
733280	735280	So that is, yeah, that's what they are mastering.
735280	736280	Definitely.
736280	745280	So do you think we need to see their, their legs in a sheer, I think they want to, right?
745280	749280	That's probably in order to be able to see that they're like pulling off like twirls.
749280	750280	They want to do it.
750280	754280	Like, yeah, the angles, the lines, I think that's, that's, that's all part of it.
754280	758280	But also, I think there's a heritage to that where it's all about this kind of heritage.
758280	762280	There's a lot of things that were bad microscope this year.
762280	763280	Slavery.
764280	765280	To name a few.
766280	767280	I hate the Olympics.
767280	769280	The 5,000 yard witch hunt.
772280	773280	Salem Olympics.
775280	777280	But I, well, just one more thing about it.
777280	778280	The 10 year dunking.
778280	791280	I think, thank you to all the figure skaters out there that are working diligently and, and spend their lives disciplining, but especially just the ones that don't opt for the, for the flesh colored over the skate.
792280	796280	Tight pants thing that turns your leg into an ice skate.
796280	800280	I like the speed skaters because they get out there with giant ass knives on their feet and they're right.
800280	801280	They're riding right close to each other.
801280	807280	When they wipe out, it's just knives flying around and these go sailing into a, like into a padded wall.
807280	809280	And it's like, it's, it's pretty exciting.
809280	812280	I'm shocked that these people can get knives on their feet.
812280	813280	All of them.
813280	814280	God bless them.
814280	816280	I mean, that's, that's, I've been on ice skates.
816280	817280	Like it's.
817280	820280	I can't, I can't even roller skate without like breaking my ass.
820280	823280	Roller skating is 10 times easier than ice skating.
823280	824280	That's how crazy ice skating is.
824280	830280	It's like, you just get out there and you just, I, I, I still just like, I'll just stand on my ankles.
830280	834280	Like I just, I don't just wait until we figure out it's not a good idea.
834280	835280	Let me do this.
836280	837280	All right.
837280	838280	Well, that's enough of that.
840280	841280	Okay.
844280	847280	Uh, let's, uh, let's hit a rap beat.
847280	850280	You, you, you visibly lost weight since I've last seen you.
850280	851280	Really?
851280	854280	He's dropped a, he's dropped a belt size.
855280	856280	For real.
856280	857280	No, for real.
857280	858280	I had to punch it.
858280	859280	You had to punch it?
859280	861280	Well, I don't know that I had to.
861280	862280	Oh yeah.
862280	864280	You, you, you, you, you're such a good assistant.
864280	866280	You had to punch a new hole in his belt.
866280	867280	Yeah.
867280	868280	Yeah.
868280	869280	Do you have like, do you have a leather all on you at all times?
869280	871280	No, I borrowed a knife.
871280	874280	I started working out every other morning in January of 2018.
874280	878280	And I, uh, then I, I basically have now been doing it every morning.
878280	879280	Two months.
879280	880280	Every other morning.
880280	882280	I add weights with Dave Klein from Harmon town.
882280	883280	I like that.
883280	886280	He's kind of just this awesome bearded guru in the foreground and you're in
886280	887280	front of a green screen.
887280	888280	And I haven't figured out.
888280	890280	People keep to keep with the other feed.
890280	893280	They go, I was like, take out, tell Dave kind of take his shirt off.
893280	895280	And he's like, Nope, it's not about me brother.
895280	896280	It's about Dan.
896280	897280	And I'm like, but also, come on.
898280	899280	He's a personal trainer.
899280	902280	If Dave, I mean, what do you think he's rocking under that shirt?
902280	904280	It can't be a washboard, right?
904280	907280	If he, if he, if he takes his shirt off, it's over for him.
907280	908280	Yeah.
908280	909280	It can't be a washboard.
909280	910280	Are you being sarcastic?
910280	914280	No, I'm just going to say it just to put it out there that I think that he's
914280	915280	I issue.
915280	920280	I write here as comptroller of Harmon town, uh, United States of America,
920280	923280	planet earth, uh, issue a challenge.
923280	925280	Dave Klein, take that shirt off.
925280	926280	Take it off.
926280	927280	We should have him on here.
927280	929280	He can take his shirt off on here.
929280	930280	I mean, that's that.
930280	931280	I don't know.
931280	932280	All right.
932280	936280	Well, let's, uh, let's, uh, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's continue our
936280	942280	fitness, uh, uh, theme of the evening by bringing up, uh, my, uh, brother in,
942280	946280	uh, body type, um, and, uh, and also ingenious.
946280	948280	I'd argue really.
948280	950280	We can, we can talk about this.
950280	952280	I think, I think we're both equally genius.
952280	955280	Let's bring up a walking dead creator, Robert Kirkwin.
956280	957280	Robert Kirkman.
957280	958280	Everybody.
958280	959280	You pick a stool.
959280	960280	You pick a my closer one.
960280	961280	Yeah.
961280	962280	Do whatever you want here.
962280	963280	RK.
963280	964280	I'm going home.
964280	967280	Oh, well, that's, I mean, it's not like we could stop you.
967280	969280	We'd be sorry to see you go, but it's with it.
969280	970280	You're right.
970280	972280	The world is your red carpet.
972280	973280	That would be awesome.
973280	974280	That would be amazing.
974280	975280	Are you sick?
975280	977280	Are you sick of being, uh, uh,
977280	983280	having guys like me, uh, just talk about you like a hunk of money?
984280	987280	Like, like, oh, like that's okay.
987280	988280	Right.
988280	989280	Fantastic.
989280	990280	I know you're a human being.
990280	996280	I just, I'm proud to, to know, uh, a guy from the fucking nineties black and
996280	1001280	white comic book world that, that, that turned it into like, uh,
1001280	1002280	something.
1002280	1003280	Yeah.
1003280	1004280	Kevin Eastman.
1004280	1005280	Yeah.
1005280	1006280	Fuck Kevin Eastman.
1006280	1007280	What's he done with his life?
1007280	1009280	You don't even hear about the turtles anymore.
1009280	1011280	It's not like they're like on television every week or something.
1011280	1012280	It's ridiculous.
1012280	1013280	It's crazy.
1013280	1016280	But, uh, uh, but no, no, I mean, that's, uh, you know, it's a little weird.
1016280	1018280	It's not something I think about 24 seven.
1018280	1022280	So when people say it, I'm kind of like, Oh yeah, but if you're not the only one,
1022280	1023280	it happens a lot.
1023280	1027280	Tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it,
1027280	1030280	tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it, tell it,
1030280	1036280	tell it, just tell us something like in the last, well, I don't know, something
1036280	1040280	that sticks out in your head as a moment when you're like, Jesus Christ, that's
1040280	1046280	really rich about yourself that you were like, someone came up to you, uh, and
1046280	1047280	said, can I have a car?
1047280	1048280	And you were like, yeah.
1048280	1053280	And then as they drove away, you're like, whoa, that's not me.
1053280	1056280	I can't believe I gave that guy a car.
1056280	1058280	I've never given anyone a car.
1058280	1061280	Well, I mean, give them family members cars.
1061280	1064280	I'm trying to think of an example so I can pave the way for you.
1064280	1067280	Don't worry about that.
1067280	1068280	Yeah.
1068280	1074280	Robert, have you ever given anybody a free iPad and not lorded over them?
1074280	1075280	Yeah.
1075280	1076280	You have me too.
1076280	1078280	That's actually very interesting to hear.
1078280	1079280	Yeah, I wouldn't.
1079280	1080280	I wouldn't.
1080280	1081280	That's like a, that's a real shitty thing to do.
1081280	1083280	Is that like, uh, is that something you did, Dan?
1083280	1085280	No, Dan didn't actually give anyone an iPad.
1085280	1087280	He just let them borrow it.
1087280	1089280	But he did, he did make them feel proud about it.
1089280	1091280	Yeah, I heard this on the previous episode.
1091280	1095280	I, uh, I buy every Apple TV movie.
1095280	1097280	No, I don't rent it.
1097280	1101280	I just buy it because I want to watch it on my other devices.
1101280	1102280	But that's not normal.
1102280	1104280	It's a rich, that's a rich guy thing.
1104280	1105280	Sure.
1105280	1106280	Yeah.
1106280	1108280	Every Apple TV movie or just the ones you like?
1108280	1110280	There's a couple that I'll just rent.
1110280	1113280	If it's like a found footage Canadian horror movie,
1113280	1115280	like, okay, I'll rent this.
1115280	1118280	So maybe it's psychotic.
1118280	1119280	I'll go ahead and admit that.
1119280	1123280	But, uh, I will often, you know, buy movies on iTunes.
1123280	1129280	Uh, but at the same time, if I catch my wife buying something on
1129280	1133280	iTunes, like a real housewives of, uh, wherever, uh,
1133280	1136280	and I know what's available on another app that we subscribe to
1136280	1139280	for free, I'll be like, Hey, come on.
1139280	1140280	Why, why are you doing that?
1140280	1142280	What are you wasting that $3 for?
1142280	1143280	Yeah.
1143280	1146280	I can't yell it or anything, but I will annoy her to a point where
1146280	1147280	she gets mad at me.
1147280	1148280	You're not being miserly.
1148280	1151280	That's a, that's a, that's a Redditor thing.
1151280	1152280	That's your aspie brain.
1152280	1154280	Like it's a logic addiction.
1154280	1156280	You're like, you can't check Hulu.
1156280	1158280	You can't check Hulu before you buy this thing on.
1158280	1160280	Don't fall for the Apple trap.
1160280	1161280	Yeah.
1161280	1164280	Our demographic has the highest ratio of, uh, wait,
1164280	1165280	I don't know how to phrase it.
1165280	1170280	It's the highest ratio of disposable income to total
1170280	1172280	unacceptance of like throwing money away.
1172280	1176280	Like, uh, like it's, it's like, like I've never seen people that
1176280	1180280	are probably pretty rich, uh, talk so meticulously about what
1180280	1182280	they're getting for $3 here or $2 there.
1182280	1184280	Like it's not, it's not even cheapness.
1184280	1185280	It is.
1185280	1188280	It's like, because they'll give $50 to the red cross.
1188280	1190280	If they see a hurricane, like they're good people.
1190280	1194280	They're not miserly, but if they're addicted to a logic,
1194280	1195280	they don't want to be a sucker.
1195280	1196280	Exactly.
1196280	1197280	Yeah.
1197280	1198280	And I did the math one time.
1198280	1201280	I was, you know, I was like, well, if she bought one or two
1201280	1205280	a week for an entire year, we're looking at like a hundred
1205280	1206280	dollars.
1206280	1207280	All right.
1207280	1208280	Quit making your wife mad at you.
1208280	1209280	Yeah.
1209280	1210280	I still, I still do it sometimes.
1210280	1213280	Anytime I do the math, I'm like, man, none of this matters.
1213280	1215280	Anytime I do the math, it's like, this doesn't add up to,
1215280	1217280	I shouldn't have even done the math.
1217280	1220280	Let me ask some walking dead questions that I've been afraid
1220280	1221280	to ask.
1221280	1222280	Oh, please.
1222280	1225280	Uh, like what happens after they leave the prison?
1226280	1229280	I've been afraid to ask that because it makes me sound like a bad friend.
1229280	1232280	The answer to almost every question that you could ask like that.
1232280	1233280	They find another.
1233280	1235280	Well, some of them die.
1235280	1237280	They die and then they find another.
1237280	1240280	I see there's a guy with a bat that has barbed wire on the bat now
1240280	1242280	that he looks like he's going to be a problem.
1242280	1243280	You don't watch the show?
1243280	1244280	I haven't watched it since they left the prison.
1244280	1245280	It's not because I know.
1245280	1246280	No, it's fine.
1246280	1247280	That in fact was the high point.
1247280	1248280	You can ask.
1248280	1249280	You know what?
1249280	1250280	We don't need you.
1250280	1251280	I don't.
1251280	1252280	I know you don't.
1252280	1255280	And I but ask ask Gimple Scott Gimple.
1255280	1258280	I went to dinner with him and I was like, holy.
1258280	1260280	It was right after the prison.
1260280	1262280	You know what happened when they left the prison.
1262280	1264280	That's what Scott Gimple took over a show runner.
1264280	1267280	So your buddy, you haven't watched any of his episodes at all.
1267280	1268280	Yeah.
1268280	1271280	I would say I guess maybe he accepted the praise and he shouldn't have.
1271280	1274280	But I was like, man, you guys are nailing it.
1276280	1277280	Yeah.
1277280	1278280	And then I just I don't know.
1278280	1280280	Maybe I look, I haven't watched it.
1280280	1281280	Well, I do a run through.
1281280	1285280	So they leave the prison and then they go to this place called Terminus.
1285280	1287280	And then I'm not going to recap.
1287280	1290280	Robert, no offense.
1290280	1291280	I don't watch a lot of TV shows.
1291280	1293280	I've never seen one second of Walking Dead.
1293280	1295280	Even how many seasons has this been on for?
1295280	1298280	We were just starting the back half of season eight.
1298280	1299280	Jesus Christ.
1299280	1302280	But also it's almost more Walking Dead than anyone can add.
1302280	1306280	That's a strong eight because there's also like three shows coming off of it.
1306280	1307280	There's a there's a cooking.
1307280	1308280	Fear of the Walking Dead.
1308280	1313280	There's a there's a there's a cooking dead chopped junior.
1313280	1314280	Yep.
1314280	1315280	Walking Dead kids.
1315280	1318280	Just kids who make food who are zombies.
1318280	1324280	Chris Hardwick like like sits in a bathtub and talks about Walking Dead in two different shows.
1324280	1327280	And then there's an actual other Walking Dead show.
1327280	1333280	There's a scripting dead where they just show pages from the script and they just slowly turn.
1333280	1334280	That could be huge.
1334280	1338280	How how how has how is fear of the Walking Dead.
1338280	1339280	There's no of right.
1339280	1340280	Oh fear fear walking.
1340280	1341280	OK.
1341280	1342280	That would be.
1342280	1343280	Yeah.
1343280	1345280	Even I know that fear of the Walking Dead.
1345280	1349280	That does sound automatically like a worst show because it's like it could just be people
1349280	1350280	in a room.
1350280	1352280	I ain't going outside to check.
1352280	1353280	I'm not going outside.
1353280	1355280	Like I hear there's zombies out there.
1355280	1357280	There might be fear of the Walking Dead.
1357280	1359280	I'm staying indoors.
1359280	1364280	How how has that been critically creatively financially.
1364280	1365280	Run through the metrics.
1365280	1367280	Check check and check.
1367280	1368280	It's all been fine.
1368280	1369280	It's still on.
1369280	1370280	Everybody's happy with it.
1370280	1371280	Yeah.
1371280	1372280	Yeah.
1372280	1373280	We just started our well we're working on a fourth season.
1373280	1374280	It'll start right after season eight.
1374280	1379280	We got Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg taking over his showrunners this season.
1379280	1383280	We got this character Morgan from Walking Dead that's going to be jumping over to feel
1383280	1384280	the Walking Dead.
1384280	1387280	So there's some crazy stuff over.
1387280	1388280	Yeah.
1388280	1390280	It's going to be it's going to be a cool new season.
1390280	1393280	I hope Morgan doesn't judge them for being such scaredy cats.
1393280	1394280	I think he will.
1394280	1395280	He's kind of a jerk that Morgan.
1395280	1397280	He's going to be like guys come outside.
1397280	1398280	It's fine.
1398280	1399280	I've been up to my ears in these things.
1399280	1402280	And you have a show about being scared of them.
1402280	1403280	What is this?
1403280	1409280	It's like it's like when it's like when Jerry Orbach went over to the trial by jury law
1409280	1410280	and order.
1410280	1411280	It's like a kind of retirement.
1411280	1413280	It's a golden parachute for this Morgan character.
1413280	1414280	Yeah.
1414280	1415280	Yeah.
1415280	1416280	Yeah.
1416280	1420280	We got to establish that we're moving him from Walking Dead show to Walking Dead show
1420280	1423280	so that when we put up a new show it's like OK and now Morgan's going to this one too.
1423280	1425280	How many Walking Deads are there?
1425280	1432280	Like how many zombies like how many of the Walking Dead like population wise?
1432280	1434280	I don't keep those numbers.
1434280	1436280	I mean just like ballpark it for me.
1436280	1437280	I don't know like a billion.
1437280	1438280	A billion?
1438280	1439280	Who knows?
1439280	1443280	So like he's going to get in a lot of trouble just for riffing that number.
1443280	1445280	It's going to be like a 90 page.
1445280	1446280	Somebody's like wait a minute.
1446280	1447280	Hold on.
1447280	1448280	A billion.
1448280	1449280	It can't be a billion.
1449280	1450280	Yeah.
1450280	1451280	Clearly not shown this much.
1451280	1452280	It's not going to.
1452280	1453280	No.
1453280	1454280	The region wouldn't have that.
1454280	1455280	It's going to be worse.
1455280	1457280	Any new season that comes out they're going to be like based on the billion zombies that
1457280	1459280	we know are on this planet.
1459280	1464280	This can't possibly be the amount of zombies that are in this Walmart or like whatever.
1464280	1465280	They're going to be sold now.
1465280	1468280	A billion zombie benchmark of 2018 on Carmen Town.
1468280	1469280	Someone did the math.
1469280	1475080	I can't remember exactly how it broke down but it was like if 10 percent of the population
1475080	1481240	remained human and they each killed like five zombies a week and every other living
1481240	1485560	person was turned into a zombie they would kill all the zombies in like 11 months.
1485560	1491560	It's like some kind of some kind of crazy are the walking dead fans.
1491560	1496240	This is such a dumb question but maybe it'll start a conversation.
1496240	1497240	Let's hope.
1497240	1502320	Because it seems that it's got our walking dead fans compared to other fandoms you've
1502320	1509680	seen are they are they more or less obsessed with stuff like that or are they more like
1509680	1514720	chill like it's not about the science or are they just the same shades.
1514720	1519880	I mean there are you know I get I get those essays you know you clearly meant this was
1519880	1520880	going to happen.
1520880	1521880	That's why it was a dumb question.
1521880	1525640	This character said this and yeah but I mean there's you know there's there's there's chill
1525640	1529520	fans and there's really crazy fans which I think are awesome.
1529520	1535960	I mean any time I get a goddamn like 30 page book report on like a two minute scene I'm
1535960	1540480	like man it's the best thing I've ever I'll read them the whole thing.
1540480	1541560	I'm like this is insane.
1541560	1546000	I won't read them but I'm like cha-ching sounds like I still got it.
1546000	1553320	I'm still a person I'm still it's like it's like if you ran a casino when you see somebody
1553320	1558160	on the sidewalk crying you're like I still got it.
1558160	1561840	So Dan you didn't read my 20 page essay on community.
1561840	1568320	No no I mean I thought I was offended by the title thought it was you know I we all we
1568320	1569320	all missed Donald.
1569320	1577800	You don't have to fucking dig into the show when it's at its weak point.
1577800	1583080	But are you okay shifting gears ever so slightly those do you got you just also finished you're
1583080	1590840	just telling me right before we came on 15 years of Invincible yes your other comic book
1590840	1597400	yeah yeah the last issue came out last week I think did it did he become invincible yeah
1597400	1602520	he died no no they lived happily ever after it was pretty lame but because if you only
1602520	1607320	lived for 15 years it's not even invincible that's like I can do that I did it three times
1607320	1613920	already fair point fair point he did not die at the end of the book spoiler alert is
1613920	1620680	it easier hard to end in the 15 year long comic book series it was pretty I don't know
1620680	1625200	it was difficult in that I mean when I was writing the last issue I kept coming up with
1625200	1630080	more ideas for the next issue oh yeah stop brain this is not what we're doing right what
1630080	1634260	are you doing and then it just made me sad because you know I've been living with these
1634260	1640380	characters for you said you were writing a script every month for 15 years years that
1640380	1645460	you didn't have to do it anymore or anything you could have run in the street naked and
1645460	1649980	said I'm Robert Kirkman arrest me and no one would be allowed to mean because of the money
1649980	1654700	yeah yeah I don't know I try to ignore that kind of stuff also you know if you sit down
1654700	1660660	and do the math it's like all right I'm gonna be broke by like 62 I'm hoping to live longer
1660660	1668460	than 60 come on you have you have Drew Carey money by now as in like you have so much money
1668460	1673340	true or false that I could host prices right that if you put all his money that he's giving
1673340	1676500	away is that what you're saying well I think Drew's being smart and going like he's gonna
1676500	1680900	he didn't want to he didn't want to become I'm so rich sometimes I watch the prices right
1680900	1685540	and I'm like really that's all yeah you guys are excited over that yeah exactly that's
1685540	1692660	one big race a Roni who cares what it costs stick it up your ass stupid housewife the
1692660	1699980	225 the the why did he say that it's the price of rice or only oh oh oh I thought you said
1699980	1705180	it's 825 I was like Jesus when did you become a fucking runtime Nazi Wow I thought you were
1705180	1709300	like I think you were like come on keep the show you know we don't do anything I was making
1709300	1713460	my bid on rice a Roni okay well I'm projecting yeah ashamed of the show I don't think it's
1713700	1722700	back to me yes um thank you thank you but but 15 years every month like like like I and we can
1722700	1728980	segue into bringing up an old friend of ours for better or for worse like I mean I watched
1728980	1736820	shrub work that circuit like I mean that's it's pretty remarkable that you kept doing it and
1736820	1742860	truly yeah you didn't have to anymore I mean I don't want to get sentimental or anything but
1742860	1747100	it is the thing I love to do I mean it's the thing I wanted to do when I grew up and and I
1747100	1753500	and I you know was fortunate enough to do it I don't care about television right well I like
1753500	1759260	that Walking Dead is a show I enjoy working in it it's a it's a fun thing money's great but you
1759260	1764740	know my true passion is comic books and so to I mean being able to do a story for 15 years was all
1764740	1769260	I ever wanted as a kid you know you read Peter David's incredible Hulk run or Walt Simonson's
1769260	1773420	run on Thor or any of these other books that most people who are listening to this probably have no
1773420	1779140	idea what I'm talking about but you know it's something that you know I always grew up going
1779140	1783100	oh my god wouldn't it be nice to be able to do that and so you know to get to a point where I
1783100	1788300	could do it and to stop you know my inner child would have been angry yeah I guess I don't have
1788300	1794140	that I'm like what's like like no no passion I mean I always liked writing but it's because it
1794140	1799620	made me feel safe from a planet of fucking drooling idiots that were at otherwise kill me
1799620	1804820	timing it like like I was like oh god they seem to enjoy when I do this like they're blood lust
1804820	1811180	and their eyes like simmers down for a second I might make it to retirement but now I'm like how
1811180	1823780	do I get out let me out anyways let's bring up Rob Schwab when it's time for shrapnel

1852020	1857620	up here hey you guys night two of the most successful comic book artists
1857620	1868860	just the two most successful comic book artists which would be gone off the face of the earth
1868860	1879140	if a bomb blew up in the middle of this building right now to the most successful comic book artists
1879780	1887980	ever in comic books would be no more off the face of the earth you were saying Dan bombs starting
1887980	1899580	to sound more and more appealing oh yeah you have no idea I learned how to draw women whoa
1899580	1909100	here we go their chins are thinner yeah that's fair no I've been I've been I've been doing like
1909100	1913860	Dan Reddick's gonna fucking eat that up tomorrow man I've been I've been doing well your chin
1913860	1917740	doesn't have to be thin if you you don't have you also don't have to be a woman look I'm woke
1917740	1926140	to have a chin yeah don't have one I'll tell mail your chin to me and I'll call you a hero
1926140	1937020	on tumblr I'm not fucking I'm fucking beyond woke I'm so woke like I'm on Adderall the actually I
1937020	1942620	think I forgot to take it that's why that's why the show sucks it doesn't it doesn't suck no it
1942620	1950220	sucks it's totally fine I've done terrible things the but I've been learning to draw via YouTube
1950220	1957420	tutorials I kind of like I never know that this where I go why well because because because it's
1957420	1962740	like it's a it's a it's a genuine like it's a hobby like I just a no requirement I'll have
1962740	1967340	passion for writing a comic book for 15 years but I think having a hobby is a waste of time hmm
1967340	1972980	well that's because well that sounds like you you you I'm envious of you because you you you
1972980	1978860	for you obviously both in terms of your longevity and the quality of your output and your continued
1978860	1985700	and the and the healthy glow in your eyes like it's all in any of your lustrous coat you you
1985700	1994620	clearly are a person who my therapist would would say to me see Dan he doesn't turn what he loves
1994620	2000100	into a nightmare so that he can be more comfortable doing it like he doesn't have a fucked up
2000100	2005300	relationship with what he loves that's all like that's that's all you got going on so you don't
2005300	2010940	need a hobby good for you whoop de do fuck off now you make me now I feel terrible hell Robert
2010940	2014220	you don't have a you don't have a hobby like a little side thing you do like model airplanes or
2014220	2022260	you like to do like your pet groomer or nothing you just draw and write pretty much yeah yeah I
2022260	2029380	mean I've got the two kids so that takes up all the non-working time exactly so yeah spending time
2029380	2034340	with my kids is that a hobby does that count no that makes drawing and writing a hobby probably
2034580	2040740	but for you a lucrative one that lets you have yeah it is definitely the old cliche of man I can't
2040740	2050660	wait till those vacations over so I get back to work yeah yeah god fuck you no that is good I
2050660	2055660	mean and everybody that I say like I want to retire you know they go like you're never gonna
2055660	2067660	end in a fistfight yeah the world's slowest saddest least necessary fist fight no one got hurt it
2067660	2073540	just for a long time and no one got hurt it descends into a shoulder rub that's not even that good I
2073540	2079300	was I was I was in a Laguna Beach bar fight and that's exactly what it was I was I Cody was so
2079300	2083660	impressed he's like I can't believe you got up and intervened I'm like no one it was that's like jury
2083660	2089340	duty there's a there was a an old guy and then like this like middle-aged guy like I couldn't tell
2089340	2095180	which one voted for Trump I had no idea obviously someone did or this wouldn't be happening they
2095180	2099740	were like yelling they start yelling at each other and then uh and then and then at one point they
2099740	2105580	both stood up and they're like me and the other two dudes in the bar both like like rolling our
2105580	2112060	eyes that got up off the bar stools like really slowly and shuffled over there to break up two
2112060	2117420	guys who were never actually gonna fight because they're both so old it was a Laguna Beach bar fight
2120380	2124620	and the funny thing is like Cody was like she's like wait I can't tell which one was the good guy
2124620	2128940	which one was the bad guy so she was trying to like eavesdrop on the loudmouth guy to see was
2128940	2134380	he a loudmouth liberal that pissed off the old coot conservative or is that an old hippie
2134540	2142060	who whose side we're on and is he like some kind of like flashy like loud drunk like uh right-wing
2142060	2147980	guy who's feeling his oats we couldn't and and and she kept she kept trying to be able to tell
2147980	2153980	from the things she was overhearing him say what which one he was and it was kind of like
2153980	2160940	it's pat sketch because you can say things like well now you sound like a libertarian and we still
2160940	2168300	don't know what you are you're just equally outraged anyways in fact it's it was funny at
2168300	2172540	the time but it's it's really not the best use of your time what else happened
2175980	2180380	let me ask where'd you go next oh uh there's another walking dead question
2181100	2183100	uh
2186620	2191420	when it first came on uh fx i they're advertising it i'm like i'm so excited
2197020	2202220	really i want i've seen him watch it like he has watched american movie classics that doesn't
2202220	2207500	make any sense i agree i've seen him read the comic they don't make television shows
2208060	2212940	what other television show have they i know okay the uh you ever seen the classic movie the
2212940	2220220	walking dead tv show when i saw the the um when i saw the ads coming i think like an idiot
2220780	2228620	i was like oh i'm so excited i'm gonna catch up on the i'm gonna reread the the trade paperbacks
2228620	2236060	that i have which it was a dumb move because the first like season was a pretty faithful like
2236060	2240140	rigorously faithful adaptation to the point where i was like so you're reading the comics
2240140	2244620	you were bored i was like i was like i was like well no well i was reading the comics in advance
2244620	2249420	of watching the show like because i was like watching the tv show i was like well i already
2249420	2256220	know that guy's racist i read that that's all then i got excited when it started deviating
2256220	2260060	i was like oh they're gonna deviate was there a big conversation about that and what side were
2260060	2265100	you on and how did that go no i mean it's i mean it's it's a weird it's a whole it's a weird process
2265100	2271900	because i'm in the writer's room a lot more on the earlier seasons and uh you know they're
2271900	2276140	talking about like well we can't do this because that didn't really work oh oh sorry robert i mean
2276140	2282220	you know it worked fine but you know so it's like a little awkward sometimes um but uh but i mean i
2282220	2287500	really enjoyed it and and it's uh it's very humbling to be in a room of writers that are picking apart
2287500	2292380	you know the thing that you wrote and and trying to turn into a tv show i think the only way i was
2292380	2297820	able to keep my sanity is because uh yeah i started walking down when i was 23 and then you
2297820	2303020	know i'm like 28 or so when the show started and so it was stuff that was like five years of my rear
2303020	2306780	view and so i could be like yeah look that didn't work i wasn't you were you were at yeah that
2306780	2312220	probably kept you from punching them in the face it was just the self-loathing sure sure yeah but
2312220	2318780	uh uh but then and i was always the one that would push to change things because uh i don't know if
2318780	2325900	i'm an asshole or or what but i i i mean i i love being surprised and it's one of the things i i
2325900	2329580	enjoy most out of my entertainment like when i don't see something coming it's that's when i'm
2329580	2336220	like oh that's the best stuff i wish i had paid an actor to be dressed as a zombie and like come
2336220	2341740	lumbering out here right now behind you just to scare me yeah i ain't scared of zombies but uh
2341740	2345980	it wouldn't surprise you it probably happens all the time on these panels we could have had rob
2345980	2352700	come out there and do a zombie a bit yeah going yeah instead of doing this rob what's going on
2352700	2359500	like you you're you're uh let's bring rob on well you let's bring rob's rob on so anyway
2362060	2369900	robert let me tell you about what i did at laguna beach let's hear it well rob sits here well well
2369900	2377500	okay so you're so ostensibly Jimmy Fallon going let's bring on Dick Cavett Dick Cavett come out
2377500	2387180	here here we go so anyway let me talk to everybody else but Dick Cavett what that doesn't make any
2387180	2391580	sense and you're also i've been talking to this fucking guy about walking dead for the last five
2391580	2396460	minutes will you roll your eyes within my eye shot are you guys i'm in your eyes shot you're

2420380	2424140	i don't think you're a hero here let's not high road me about my hosting skills
2424860	2429020	okay if i if i do an in-depth charlie Kaufman or charlie Kaufman what do you call him what's
2429020	2434860	a charlie rose charlie rose interview uh uh with Robert Kirkman you're gonna be you're gonna be
2434860	2439980	more sad than than all the laguna beach anecdotes the world would make you you'd be you'd be you'd
2439980	2447500	be incensed yeah what's going on with you well i don't know what what do you mean i got one of
2447500	2451340	those bidet toilet seats that you have but it fucking great it won't fit on my toilet you got
2451340	2456220	like a bidet doesn't fit on my toilet it didn't fit on the toilet you gotta Kirkman do you use a
2456220	2463500	bidet come on went to a hotel that had about uh bidet whoa and uh did not enjoy that do you have
2463500	2470300	a fancy bathroom no not really just too wet so so you there's an attachment you can put on your
2470300	2475180	existing toilet you take your toilet seat off that you are that comes with the toilet then you put
2475180	2480780	the new one on it it's got heated it's heated seat because i've been on yours and yours is like
2480780	2486060	this weird like it plays you music it like it massages you there's a lot of buttons yeah yeah
2486060	2492460	i need to upgrade need to uh you get it to the uh bidet apple store and upgrade that shit
2493020	2499100	get me some get me some new apps you know what you guys share as artists is a is a very storyboard
2499100	2510220	style whoa thank you dan thanks so i don't care much for bidets so what happens is you you put a
2510220	2513820	thing on you take your toilet seat off you put this piece of machinery on it and there's a little
2513820	2519420	hose that shoots water up your butt yeah it's more of a nozzle it's a nozzle it's like an upside down
2519420	2523420	spray bottle how do you work on the aim of those things i mean i was at a hotel i imagine you can
2523420	2529820	adjust but you gotta get back and forth you gotta get like oh you moved during it that's
2529820	2535260	interesting because i was i was you don't have to but i do you're a master robert i was in india
2535260	2541900	recently and and a lot of bidets and a lot of bidets but not as we stayed in very like um you
2541900	2546860	know because it was an english colony for so long very very westernized hotels so there were no bidets
2546860	2552380	and hotels we stayed at but a couple of the places we went to like nice restaurants in nice areas
2553100	2557980	in the men's room i'm assuming the women's room too there was just a hose like a garden hose with
2557980	2563180	it's like a nozzle a squeeze nozzle yeah and it's just laying on the floor next to the toilet and
2563180	2567340	like that's and there's no paper that's not clean there's no paper at all so you're supposed to get
2567340	2573180	up and just hose off your butt and then you got a wet butt and you pull your pants up i i or do you
2573180	2577500	or do you just drip dry like there's people outside waiting to hose off their but you just
2577500	2583660	bring naan into the bathroom with you you're pretty oh you see now that's i see i i i bring
2583660	2587900	some pop it down is that not okay i bring the pop it down it's a little lighter and flakier
2589340	2594140	that must that must be they must be that must be some good indian food if they got like
2594140	2600300	hoses for your butt yeah yeah it's food so spicy you're going to want to hose your assholes
2600380	2608300	yeah but given the choice between a roll of toilet paper and it but you can't have both
2608300	2613580	given a choice you choose water i'm talking about restrooms at nice restaurants that had no paper at
2613580	2619580	all anywhere and like you couldn't even go and get a paper tell them bring it into the thing with you
2619580	2623820	you had a hose on the ground that presumably everybody that's ever taken a poop there has
2623820	2629900	recently used oh and you got to you don't stick it up your butt you end up you rinse your asshole
2629900	2635580	off but like it it looked it looked it looked dry so people know how to do that without spraying
2635580	2639020	down the whole building well because they don't they probably they haven't had a toilet paper
2639020	2645180	culture for like from rich to poor like they just don't use toilet paper but then you somebody
2645180	2652220	helped me out well into a hole into the toilet bowl have you seen slumdog millionaire it goes to india
2654780	2660620	yeah but but like it didn't look wet and people have been pooping in there i mean obviously they
2660620	2667580	know how to do it delicately but then i my main thing is now you got a wet butt and a wet crotch
2667580	2673420	and then you just pull up your wet poopy drawers and go back to have desserts ostensibly they're
2673420	2678220	just wet come on we've all taken a big giant shit and then gotten right in the shower right
2678220	2683420	at least once god yeah you have to just for the thrill of it you just go like you know what not
2683500	2690380	wiping yeah gotta gotta take a shower anyway no right no i've never done that then i haven't
2690380	2698060	either no you haven't done that not me not it not you kirkman come on look at us no i've i've
2698060	2703660	taken a bath i've taken a shit so bad that i then had to take a shower afterwards even after i've
2703660	2709660	cleaned up just yeah but that's after the way there's no way i've handled this how old are
2709660	2716140	you kids uh there'll be uh they're 11 and eight if they're about to turn nine and 12 so so both uh
2716140	2723740	boys older boy younger girl oh see i shit in the shower so and then i don't know the worst sound
2729260	2734300	i mean even if we don't go to the creepy creepy place it's just a dumb reaction to have
2734380	2740620	it's it's a standard biological amount of diversity yeah two kids one's a boy one's a girl oh
2742060	2747260	the old 7 10 split hey i'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt that that to me that was
2747260	2752540	you making a sound to cover the fact that you could not care less about my children and you
2752540	2756940	regretted asking that question you're like why did i ask about kids i don't care about kids
2757580	2762940	you're half right it was it was a it was a standard uh bad interviewer nervous tick like
2762940	2769100	i need to have a reaction with uh but i didn't regret asking it because i'd love to talk to a
2769100	2773820	genius about having kids because i it's uh i'm not to put you on the spot but i'm sure you're
2773820	2778860	gonna say things that no one's ever said let's hear it how old are you when you had your first
2778860	2789100	child uh oh uh 27 oh that's respectable age it's a solid third baseline and and my wife hates it
2789100	2794300	when i talk about it but you know i'm from kentucky and um you know everybody has kids when
2794300	2801020	they're like 21 22 23 so we were we were we were late late in the game at 27 yeah yeah
2802140	2807980	yeah us too wisconsin same thing i mean it's kind of like you you not you know basically like the
2807980	2815660	two cities that dinosaurs and uh king kong's don't attack in the movies wait or do attack
2815740	2819260	those are the only exceptions everywhere else i think people get married pretty pretty quickly
2819260	2827740	after high school yeah you know it's the king kong and the godzilla factor that really um no
2827740	2834460	that's not keeps uh why do you why do you keep having him on yeah it yeah i keep asking the same
2834460	2840460	thing the whole time thinking he'll bring my ipad back i think i keep getting texts from levy like
2840460	2845740	on are you coming are you bringing are you coming rob can i show starting are you gonna
2845740	2852300	you're gonna be here you'll be here show starting are you on your way you're still coming right
2852300	2857740	it's because we're worried about we had to we had to have shrub on for uh the third installment do
2857740	2861740	you think that psychologically the reason i'm 44 and haven't had children is because i grew up in
2861740	2866700	a place that's so likely to get king kong or godzilla or meteor attacked it's because we live it
2867420	2871180	well why have a child you know that any moment you're gonna get armageddon godzilla yeah
2872220	2875820	tommy lee jones is gonna be on your doorstep screaming about something new york and los
2875820	2881420	angeles more so los angeles than new york geostorm because new york has people that lift things and
2881420	2886380	fish for things but like these two big cities people go to them because they're like still
2886380	2892220	not giving up on their fucking like i'm gonna i'm still a baby i'm gonna i'm gonna have a big
2892220	2896380	pacifier in my mouth it's gonna be made of solid gold and sometimes i can take till you're 45
2897340	2904220	it's interesting to be twice the age of the average rick and morty viewer and to be like
2904220	2910220	oh this person would be my kid if i had kids when my wisconsin dna kind of
2911660	2916620	said that it was time to have kids like this this would be my kid and he's an idiot

2994620	2999740	things uh and i'm like looking through the aftermath of when i like like put a kid on blast
2999740	3006140	on the reg as the fam says um and uh and it says good or bad there's a bunch of like you didn't

3009660	3014140	like where you clapping you can all go fuck yourselves can i just interrupt you just to
3014140	3018380	say that being put on blast sounds like the coolest thing like i know it's like an aqua

3024060	3028940	trying to put your teeth on blast that sounds like the new drop and loads you know quip puts
3028940	3033340	your teeth on blast with its new vibrating uh toothbrush head that you get in the mail
3034220	3040380	you've been put on blast the person said in the instagram comment that that that that caught my
3040380	3048380	attention was uh hey uh yeah why and you wonder why it is that you have such shitty fans in response
3048380	3053500	to me being shitty to one of my shitty fans like in other words oh i'm such a toxic person
3053500	3058140	then i'm gonna go ahead and tell a kid to go fuck himself for being a piece of garbage to my
3058140	3065660	girlfriend oh that explains everything that's why i have shitty fans yeah they're the shadow
3065660	3072700	i cast by being a shitty person or it's a popular show and everyone's an idiot everyone on adult
3072700	3079100	swim is a fine member of society until rick and morty if i self-actualize i'll create a show that
3079100	3084860	has perfect fans and then i'll engage with all of them on the internet and not kill myself ever
3085020	3090300	dollar that's a reasonable expectation right now like not trump and not like the administration
3090300	3094380	but like who right now like something a little more obscure if you could put anybody on blast
3094380	3102380	right now well kirkman was putting me on blast what did i do don't you mind being a boring guest

3361580	3366700	much bigger room yeah good good much bigger room but did they promote your new comic book no
3366700	3373660	definitely not oblivion song oblivion song by robert kirkman and lorenzo de felici oh my god he's
3373660	3381260	Italian races i don't think it's racist to say that based on if you don't read his book you
3381260	3386940	you may wake up dead i was just in italy they do all talk like mario they do whoa no i'm just
3387020	3391820	kidding let's go is that is that bad is that no no i i was on the internet today no that was a
3391820	3396700	wall of impression like i was impressed like that it is it is exciting when you go to a foreign
3396700	3400140	country and they actually like you meet somebody and they actually do like the thing that you would
3400140	3404220	think would be stereotypical like i was in a car i probably said this before a long time ago in
3404220	3409260	harmontown but i got into a car when i got to like Naples i was driving and we were talking and he's
3409260	3414300	like how many people live in uh in los angeles i don't know like 25 million he goes oh mama mia
3415260	3418940	and i he was in the front and i was in the back and i'm looking at him like is he is he
3418940	3423500	fucking doing this am i on camera for tourists but he gave he actually gave me a full-on mamma mia
3423500	3428780	and then i was in paris when i got off i got a like a few for real ooh la la they really
3428780	3436300	fucking say it they say they say ooh la la in italy in paris in paris yes that's where they say
3436300	3441660	yeah in italy they say mamma and that they say mamma mia in italy italy yes and then they say
3441660	3446300	in france they say ooh la la so oblivion song is a science fiction comic book yeah all kinds
3446300	3451420	great stuff in it it's super cool so why is the oblivion march seventh what's so hypnotic about
3451420	3459660	the oblivion song and in china they go oh hell no i don't see any zombies in here no zombies no no i
3459660	3465100	decided that they don't come in till later all right well let's give it a chance try to change
3465100	3469500	it up a little bit i mean i'm in a rut but what's the what's the log line on oblivion song can you
3469500	3476860	can you reveal that oh the log line is terrible uh no i i it's a complicated idea but it's
3476860	3481580	basically there's like 300 000 people in philadelphia that get uh sent to another dimension
3481580	3487660	basically a large landmass in philadelphia transposes with a large landmass in another dimension
3487660	3493900	and then uh our main character nathan cole is a scientist who is tasked with uh trying to rescue
3493900	3498140	those people but when our story takes place it's been 10 years they've stopped finding people
3498140	3503500	they've lost funding and he is still going over there and doing it because his brother is lost in
3503500	3507180	that dimension so he's going to get his other people from the other dimension now populating
3507180	3511500	that part of philadelphia there's no people in the other dimension it's a very primitive uh
3512140	3516140	alien world with like monsters and all kinds of crazy stuff got some monsters rolling around
3516140	3519580	yeah yeah yeah so they're going where it did 10 years ago and they've all been cleaned out and
3519580	3523100	there's like a museum and stuff they're walking down to the strip and getting some fucking
3523100	3528780	pravani brothers and fucking that's pittsburgh sorry it's like a land of decay and if your mouth
3528780	3534860	is a land of decay you should brush it and the way that you can ensure your brush won't go soft
3534860	3539740	as you use it at which point it becomes so ineffective that most dentists say you may as
3539740	3545100	well stop hit yourself in the face with a hammer then keep brushing with your expired shitty target
3545100	3551340	toothbrush go to the good people at quip uh they mail you a new toothbrush hat every fucking
3551980	3557420	statistical period when you need it it's a millennial toothbrush it's time to put
3557420	3564140	gingivitis on blast yeah you know quip is the uh toothbrush of choice that uh oblivion song
3564140	3573340	headquarters oh really yeah keep your mouth out of it you you and frick frick that's not okay
3573340	3577980	yeah it's kind of it's not okay to call him frick net his name is lorenzo i saw somebody
3578620	3586060	italian uh there's no way that uh anna lisa leonie your colorist is related to leo leonie
3586060	3591740	the famous children's book author who left us i don't believe so yeah it's probably a common name
3591740	3599100	yeah yeah just leonie's like growing on trees over in italy yeah probably so how many issues do you
3599100	3605500	have and what what uh i mean how many do you how many what character are people going to be cos
3605500	3610620	playing at the next comic con oh boy uh there's a cool character named keith that comes in in issue
3610620	3614140	three that looks awesome are you going to be right back on the monthly schedule where you're
3614140	3617660	just like i gotta write an oblivion song this month yeah i mean we've actually been working
3617660	3622300	on that book in secret for almost two years so that you know i can keep on the monthly schedule
3622300	3627740	without wanting to kill myself that's awesome uh we've we're working on issue 12 right now but issue
3627740	3633660	one comes out in uh on march 7th and so we're basically a year ahead of schedule is your 11
3633660	3640460	year old smart yes would you tell me if he was stupid yeah he's not listening to this yeah i
3640460	3647420	would just ask you to edit it out right right is he is he like is he a nerd he is uh yeah i mean
3647420	3652140	he plays the video games he doesn't do the sports and how old's the daughter uh she's eight will be
3652140	3658540	nine so they're both like asking a lot of questions about uh birds and clouds and stuff
3659340	3663900	not really they're answering my questions about birds and clouds and stuff oh uh but uh no i mean
3663900	3667420	they're you know they're very creative uh my my daughter what don't you know about birds and
3667420	3671580	clouds no i'm just i'm just saying they where you find them i don't know they're know-it-alls they're
3671580	3676460	like yeah they're not coming to you how aware are they of your like celebrity status so you like
3676460	3681740	like what like the the role you play in that part is frustrating i mean they're very aware i mean
3681740	3686060	much more aware now that they're in school because the other kids in school like hear things from
3686060	3690700	their parents or older siblings or whatever and so like my son comes home from school and is like oh
3690700	3696140	i hear uh you're pretty uh pretty popular and i'm like what are you talking about eddie van halen's
3696140	3701660	kids says my dad's some kind of mucky muck exactly well there was one cool there was one
3701660	3708380	day where he came home and he was like dad the the middle school kids found out who my dad was
3708380	3716060	and they were talking to me it was totally awesome like all these like 13 14 15 year olds
3716060	3720380	were talking to him and so he was like the king of the school for a day uh so that was nice but
3720380	3726780	uh but yeah they uh uh the frustrating part is like i was on the conan o'brien show and so uh i go
3727980	3732700	totally on this talk show you guys should watch the segment and uh and i put him on the couch
3732700	3737580	you know because if i was a kid and my dad had come home and been like i'm on television i would
3737660	3743180	have jumped up and been like what are you kidding me like holy crap you know i would have lost my
3743180	3749500	mind and my kids are like yeah okay whatever and then i turn it on and they're like okay can we go
3749500	3753660	do we have to watch this whole thing and i was like oh what the hell like they don't they don't care
3753660	3759420	well they're probably either they don't care because you're enough without that which is
3759420	3765420	it's normal to that right like they're like oh yeah they've seen you on g4 for 30 years yeah
3765660	3770460	robert we can here at harmontown give you a beat and you can put your kids on blast right now if you

4417740	4422780	people are really starting to say that it's becoming well known armored rhinos that's cool
4422780	4428380	yeah it's fun you've seen it is that a spoiler am i going to be bummed out to know oh huge spoiler
4428380	4433260	you're gonna you're gonna be like oh that's why they keep on setting up all these rhino uh horn
4433260	4441980	shaped doors the protagonist is an armorer who keeps making giant all these strange hieroglyphs
4441980	4446940	about a beast there probably is some poacher justice porn in it right because it takes place
4446940	4452780	all in africa in wakanda like which is a oh there's no poacher that like has like a just a
4452780	4458540	vibranium weight fall on his head while he's like about to shoot a elephant i guess they touch on
4458540	4464220	human traffic you think pornhub has a porn them as a tag for poacher justice of course poacher
4464220	4470620	justice porn poacher justice porn probably save that poacher stuff for the sequel yeah did i step
4470700	4479740	on your song no no no go ahead no it's drop a beat don't drop a beat i will pick it up and put it
4479740	4487500	it's uh wakanda is a as an african nation that uh has they had like an area 51 style
4488140	4493500	crash or something so they had they had started that way they had early access to vibranium yeah
4493500	4499820	for the beginning of society they kind of have it so like they've always uh evolved with this kind
4499820	4505020	of better technology in theory that's why they're they're like future future style it's a fun idea
4505660	4512700	great great can anyone explain the the thing because i all i see all i all i'm catching
4512700	4525180	third fourth fifth societal hand is the idea that that detractors of the movie that are obsessed
4525260	4530220	with they're like pointing out that wakanda is not real i don't i don't quite i don't understand
4530220	4534940	is that is that just a is that just a thing when people are pretending that people care about or
4534940	4543580	is there like an actual look why does that i'm just it's a weird one i don't weird one to pick
4543580	4548380	for superhero movies oh that place isn't real why is that why is that a place to go i can't suspend
4548460	4554780	my disbelief on on a place name if you've never heard of gotham is that well whatever i guess i
4554780	4558460	just have a bunch of rhetorical questions that would probably just fan flames let's hear the top
4558460	4566220	five rhetorical questions top five dan harman top five rhetorical questions number five starting
4566220	4573740	with number three oh shit well are you asking that because you want africa to be worse off than it is
4573740	4585500	number two are you worried africa will get a good rap number five uh are have you noticed
4586220	4594940	the total absence of a hogwarts in your neighborhood number one number one are you racist just say
4594940	4599740	you're racist and we can be friends and i'll have a racist friend like i will just get through your
4599740	4604540	white racism i'm i'm an alcoholic i we all have problems great question number four
4610380	4612060	does there even need to be a number four
4615100	4621820	yes there does that's it well yeah it was meta that was good is there ever any meta moments in
4621820	4626860	walking dead comics does uh does anyone ever look at the uh panel camera and go
4627820	4633020	they see more like uh every issue you're not going to like the next page
4633660	4639020	yeah like just to the camera i did do a thing recently i'm going to spoil recent issues of
4639020	4646940	walking dead just so i have something to talk about um because uh uh well just just stop
4646940	4650540	listening if you don't want recent issues they get out of the prison i know that well no they
4650540	4654540	come to a new community and and machone who's a character that's been in the book for a very long
4654620	4659340	time finds out that her daughter is alive she walks the she walks the she's the one who learns
4659340	4665260	the technique of cutting off their jaws and walking them around as uh as walker camouflage
4665260	4670220	that is her uh and so uh so she she finds her daughter and it's like two straight issues of
4670220	4675660	all positive like happy cliffhangers and she's reunited with her daughter and it's all happy
4675660	4680860	cliffhangers yeah it's all good news because there's you know it was like 175 so we've done
4680860	4684620	174 issues where all the cliffhangers are all just misery right you know like this guy's getting
4684620	4688700	his hand cut off and then you're like this guy's mom finally ended one where someone's shaking a
4688700	4695260	gift box and it sounds like a puppy but it could be a kitten and then it's a puppy and so i was
4695260	4699740	convinced that people would be pissed off and so when when we reveal that the daughter is actually
4699740	4704700	alive she works at a bakery and she comes out holding a cake and she sees her mother who she's
4704700	4709340	thought was dead for the last many many years live in the zombie apocalypse and she drops
4709340	4716060	the cake that she's holding right so uh so i was like if people really hate this they'll say that
4716060	4719580	instead of the comic jumping the shark in this issue they'll be like this is the issue where
4719580	4725020	they drop the cake right and i was trying to i was trying to create my own like right like nuking
4725020	4730220	the fridge you know but i give you a bit people have liked it a happy cliffhanger is a hopeful
4730220	4735260	cliffhanger that's that it's uh it's uh it's you can still have a cliffhanger but it can be hinged
4735260	4741740	on hope it's kind of an interesting concept because correct me if i'm wrong but a hopeful
4741740	4747820	cliffhanger actually is you're still laying uh it's just a question whether you're saying oh
4747820	4756300	shit something horrible right did happen we'll see you next week or saying oh shit i just found out
4756300	4763100	my daughter is alive but i haven't talked to her yet tune in yeah and well and hopefully after
4763100	4768860	you know 15 years of The Walking Dead when i present a character like Michonne with a living
4768860	4773660	daughter the audience is going oh man is she gonna die soon like is this gonna get taken away is
4773660	4777900	just gonna get ugly quickly like you know hopefully people are having those worries
4778540	4787180	we'll see maybe they're The Walking Dead the readers the viewers you don't even like tv just
4787500	4793420	say that they're the people that read the comic book are The Walking Dead the people that are no
4793420	4798060	wait i'm sorry they're the they're the walking uh the reading dead they're the good they're
4798060	4802540	the no they're the normal they're the reading humans the people have watched the tv show
4802540	4808940	they're the viewing dead i got drunk sorry oh that's fine i don't have a passion for television
4808940	4813580	but i do love it i love working on it i mean i'm not gonna be completely negative about the whole

4888140	4891820	doesn't it frustrate you sometimes when people don't like understand what we do to the point
4891820	4897260	where they feel like they need to give us ideas what a dick it did for you're being such a dick
4897260	4903740	right now sorry he said hey can i be a dick right now sorry he said like really like thoughtful
4905180	4910540	he was nice about it all right you know what harder these assholes think they can give us
4910540	4915740	ideas it's like we like we're throwing ideas out that we can't get to what the hell it frustrated
4915740	4923340	the thing that frustrates me is uh and i swear to god it was it was for altruistic reasons because
4923340	4929420	it was like more like oh i weep for our children kind of thing it was frustrating to me for a while
4929420	4938060	now i'm jaded but it was frustrating to me for a while when 20 mid kids in their mid 20s
4938060	4948300	otherwise known as grown ass humans um uh like who clearly like have successfully been conned
4948300	4956860	by the society that i grandfathered into like into thinking that television is like a
4957740	4963340	water or gas company or something because they simply have a problem with the temperature of
4963340	4967900	it coming out of their tap which means they're never going to create anything and i know that
4967900	4974220	i'm not as amazing as i am i know that the fact that i ended up in hollywood making my own shit
4974620	4980140	must have had something to do with the fact that at some point along the line somebody told me in
4980140	4986300	some way that resonated with me you know you could do it too you could just do it and i feel like
4986300	4991740	when i read i used to feel sad when i would read certain shit like where i'd be like wow you think
4991740	4998620	tv is toothpaste and you don't know that your parents buy your toothpaste like you think that
4998620	5009820	you're just mad at 25 that the tv came out wrong and you're not even ashamed that you're saying
5009820	5017340	like horrible shit to someone that you that is designed semantically to provoke their suicide
5017900	5023340	over the fact that something wasn't written by you because you don't know you could write
5023900	5027180	and that used to make me sad but then i turned 45 and i was like cha-ching
5027180	5034060	enslaved population like then they voted for trump and then i was like stay dumb
5035260	5040060	fucking let me give me five years stay this stupid let me out of here i don't agree with
5040060	5046380	any of your social security checks while you're at it it's braver than me i commend that i yeah
5046380	5056220	but when i was 30 when i was your age uh when my kid was only 11 uh i uh i i i i would be like this
5056220	5062860	is such a bummer man like like like it's not that i'm smarter than kids it's it's like it's
5062860	5066940	it's just like i had a school paper they don't have a school paper if they had a school paper
5066940	5071500	they wouldn't be saying this shit or they would have been saying it in the school paper and you
5071500	5074940	never would have seen it and they would have they said it in school paper and it would have activated
5074940	5079420	them and they would have become a tv writer but instead they like go to like english class and
5079420	5083820	english classes here's how you'll pass your sats maybe unless you're going into the funnel that
5083820	5088700	will take you to mcdonald's here you go oh you can say um by the way enjoy watching television
5088700	5093180	which is created by a mysterious race of people in california that no one has any idea how they
5093180	5097660	got out there but we don't know they're all liberal cucktards that just uh are ungrateful
5097660	5101900	and it's like and it's like no one at any point says to these kids in the hallway by their locker
5101900	5107180	by the way you could you could just move out there and start writing tv you think that that
5107180	5113820	there's a there's a lack of awareness in the general population that they could be a writer
5113820	5119900	there's a lack of of creative arts education there's out there was a genuine general 20-year
5119900	5126460	pullback on in our educational institutions particularly the public ones of on one side
5128620	5132700	what do you call it because i don't fraternize with blue collar people but
5132780	5138380	um the uh work programs the trades the trades like the internships where you could be
5139100	5142860	if you were going to be a mechanic and you were good at it high school wouldn't tell you you were
5142860	5146860	a worthless piece of shit and you should go to rehab they would tell you you could be a mechanic
5146860	5153580	and like place you in a fucking mechanic job or and and then on the other hand also you if you're
5153580	5157980	if you're gonna go to college but possibly maybe don't know exactly what you're supposed to do
5157980	5162620	that like oh there's a thing called poetry there's a thing called fucking like thinking about shit

5326300	5330940	like in jamaica making some crazy zombie stuff that you're just like you gotta check out this
5330940	5337180	jamaican kids doing some really like some revolutionary zombie stuff you gotta check
5337180	5342380	it out i got some well if i got a thumb drive full if only i had my finger on the pulse of all
5342380	5351180	the new zombie stuff going on there's this kid no jamaica his zombies are iri yeah it is yeah
5351180	5359260	it's a twist i do still enjoy zombie uh zombie stuff i i just recently uh rewatched day of the
5359260	5366140	dead which is a classic great very excited about that it's far too long wait the uh the classic
5366220	5372300	or the remake the oh the classic i did did you so i haven't seen the room i've been obsessive
5372300	5375820	about the day of the dead i was like i would tell people like that's that's the best like
5375820	5382220	the romero trilogy it's so great that it builds from workaday schmucks in a black and white house
5382220	5388700	going like what the fuck's happening to the next tier of civilization which is these slightly more
5388700	5393900	privileged cops and and reporters like holding up in a shopping mall and then that the culmination
5393900	5399500	is this like oh my god this isn't even life anymore it's scientists and soldiers they're
5399500	5404300	literally buried but the but the only thing i noticed because i kept telling dakota i was like
5404300	5409180	you gotta see like like first we gotta i gotta show you these first two movies and then i got
5409180	5414060	i kept telling her like yeah day of the dead and it's like it's the best it's like in a bunker and
5414060	5420460	it's like crazy and then i watched it again i felt a little embarrassed in the eyes of the person i
5420540	5424540	was trying to indoctrinate because i was like oh i forgot there's no zombies in this one
5426860	5430940	it's the coming to the end and plenty all right well it's got the good
5430940	5434780	i can't tell if you're high roading me or medium roading me you're helping me you're trying to help
5434780	5439180	me out no but uh you shouldn't have felt bad my the most fascinating thing about day of the dead
5439180	5443820	if you guys don't know this is that uh that wasn't the movie that george romero originally wanted to
5443820	5448540	make there's a different script that you can find online for the original day of the dead that was
5448540	5454060	like this massive movie that had different people living on an island and well he eventually did
5454060	5458700	that right he never did that movie he did another movie that took place on an island were there in
5458700	5462780	the sky rise and the zombies learned a little land of the dead yeah yeah yeah there was some material
5462780	5468060	i think from that that ended up in land of the dead dead reckoning was in oh was the i thought
5468060	5473100	that yeah i thought that it's been a while since i've read it wasn't wasn't didn't romero like say
5473100	5476860	like there were certain zombies that they were actually being used as weapons like they were
5477420	5481980	had different colorings on them or yeah do you know yeah like certain zombies i think they were
5481980	5486700	trained to do different things there was a lot more bubs in the original right right right yeah
5486700	5490780	yeah i mean i think i didn't feel like romero's obsession was with the idea that there was an
5490780	5499500	evolution happening yeah like which i would say like you know like i'm not i'm not i'm really not
5499500	5503420	my favorite aspect it's it's it's like no i don't need that it sort of looks like like the wachowski
5503420	5508620	siblings like being into parts of the matrix trilogy that you're like oh you look you've
5508620	5513260	earned the right to be obsessive about this but you're when colonel sanders takes you know him
5513260	5519020	and haan on stuff i can't understand well i can someone just wear sunglasses yeah i'm smart enough
5519020	5523900	trench coats and i think that i think that comes from the fact that like nightly living dad was
5523900	5531980	originally like conceived by russo and and dredge romero as a sequel to omega man like the idea was
5531980	5536860	supposed to be let's listen because we liked last man on earth the the vincent bryce one and if you
5536860	5542380	watch last man on earth at night of living death they feel like like one's a prequel but like at
5542380	5546940	the last minute well not at the last month they said well we can't do that let's let's choose a
5546940	5551980	different it can't be vampires let's make them zombies and they'll eat people instead of doing
5552700	5560940	uh uh drinking blood but in the omega man like the lat the the the vampires were slowly taking
5560940	5566060	over the the world and becoming the dominant species so that's kind of like what i think he
5566060	5570220	was doing with the zombies the zombies were taking over and they were becoming their own dominant
5570220	5576540	species and the humans were going to be in a sense it's also then a prequel to uh daybreakers
5578460	5585500	with steven dwarf all right wasn't that with uh it was about the girls that with the ski masks
5585580	5591260	and a spring break they go down and it's rock places you know james franko that's spring
5591260	5596540	breakers not day breakers is vampires have taken over and they have like a it's a it's a future
5596540	5603100	vampire society where vampires are the dominant species and humans are it's a very shrubby thing
5603100	5610060	like i'm pretty sure you probably have seen it yeah um ski patrol it's not ski patrol i've named
5610140	5616940	the movie three times now have you seen daybreakers wedding fractures god damn it all of you daybreakers
5616940	5621740	it's eating hot drinks drink your drink drink your drink vampires are people i'm actually
5622620	5628380	have you had i don't want to get into your politics but like here we go like when you
5628380	5632940	watch day of the day i left my making america great again had it home but go ahead and they've
5632940	5638380	got that like you know that plotting synth score and then she's got to go to her meeting with the
5638380	5645020	soldiers it's like isn't that the dread that that scene and it's early in the movie it's like
5645020	5648620	basically it's the call to adventure because there's nothing left anymore and it's just the
5648620	5653580	there let's have a meeting and the soldiers are like i want to know what the fuck is going on and
5653580	5658300	i've got the fucking guns and what the fuck are you eggheads doing and you know and it's like
5658300	5666060	you're just in a lab coat it's so you it's like it's the liberal nightmare is like i like oh yeah
5666060	5673500	okay the world's gotten so shitty that you control it and you're a horrible person and i have no idea
5673500	5678060	what you're gonna do i only know what the zombies are gonna do and we've gotten pretty good at
5678060	5684540	controlling them and we'd like that comfort to continue it's a very resonant for today
5684540	5691340	moment that that conversation because it's like no good guys or bad guys because if you strain
5691340	5697180	the dumb part of your brain you can relate to the soldiers too they're like give us some results
5697180	5702460	we have a bunch of assault rifles should we not be like maybe going and finding a new bunker
5705420	5710300	when when she goes down when they're like we got to get out of here and they're about to leave and
5710300	5718140	they go down and uh and nicotero's head is on and he's doing that they find that and she finds the
5718140	5724540	tape recorder and he's goes it's my buckling father you know when frankenstein is doing all
5724540	5730140	the recording and then she freaks out like oh no oh my god no i never really understood what was
5730140	5735900	your interpretation of that moment yes somebody this is the best use of robert kirkman of any
5735900	5741580	podcast i hope no i i i can't remember exactly what he says but it it's mine no big father it's
5741580	5746620	mine stop stop it father i put it away father remember when yeah no no they're kind of vaguely
5747020	5752060	the scene i don't think i ever understood what i didn't know if it was somebody said oh he's
5752060	5756700	fucking the zombies in the butt yeah i always thought there was some kind of sexual really
5756700	5764700	really really but honestly i think that is the cinematic ockham's razor because why else is that
5764700	5773020	recording a plot point yeah and i think that if you write backwards from the um if the answer is
5773100	5780620	it's a revelation that the doctor is fucking the zombie in the 70s the way you'd hear that
5781420	5786060	as a plot device on a tape recorder would be a bunch of weird improv about like
5787100	5793580	daddies and as opposed to because it wouldn't be like yeah if your zombie ass feels so good on my
5793580	5799020	normal living dick that's so tight because it's fucking dead and cold it would be like it would
5799020	5804460	be it would have to be veiled all right by robert kirkman i mean if that was it would have to be
5804460	5810620	veiled like oh he's perverted and perverts talk about their talk about daddy you know while
5810620	5816780	they're doing nasty stuff but what's the alternative explanation it's just that he's he's crazy or just
5816780	5821740	that he's yeah i think that her thing is she's like oh god we've been i've been defending him
5821740	5826780	to the soldiers this whole time and he's batshit insane he's out of his mind yeah i would say if
5826780	5833340	that's true double beat yeah i'm gonna say it's because he's been fucking she knew that he was
5833340	5839260	off you know he was she was impatient with him too she just was like she's she's like doctor what
5839260	5844060	are we gonna do the fucking soldiers are getting worse than the zombies and and he's like civilized
5844060	5851100	more data that's like civilized so yeah if if there's a change in story direction as she's
5851180	5857580	implying with her shocked reaction it maybe maybe it's because i'm limited
5858220	5862220	but it almost seems like it could only mean that she's finding out he was
5863180	5869180	fornicating with the chained up zombie i feel like there must be another option but yeah i
5869180	5873420	think you might be right i also want to say i hope that i wish that wasn't true because i find that
5873420	5879180	again as with the like whole bub evolution i find that stuff to be totally like not at all what's
5879180	5884380	appealing about zombie mythology like i i just don't you know shrab and i've talked about this
5884380	5889020	endlessly but like it's just like the 70s had it nailed at a certain point because it was like
5889580	5896140	they're just a sea of death they're stupid they're slow not that i mind the new post 9 11
5896140	5902860	running zombies that shriek like bobcats and leap from rafters it it obviously works for us too
5903740	5908060	and it has its own resonance it's an either or situation i mean sometimes i like the movies
5908140	5912460	where they're running and i like it in that movie but i mean i prefer the slower ones but it's not
5912460	5918620	like oh these movies suck but the idea that the the the living are the wild cats the living are
5918620	5924540	the problem because they're living the living are are unpredictable the living are in and of
5924540	5930140	themselves capable of ruining everything by pushing one button either in a conversation or
5930140	5936460	on a switchboard whereas these fucking things have perfect order they have the american dream slash
5936460	5942620	the russian dream slash like the immortality like and like oh my god they're gonna get us but
5942620	5947100	none of them are gonna high five each other or you know and it's like that's why that
5947100	5954060	bub aspect of romero's dream always that distracted me too because i was like i don't i know i'm
5954060	5959740	supposed to like jump up in the theater and go one of them used a gun or learned to use a doorknob
5959740	5966860	like like not at all to me the point but yeah i mean i think uh i mean that's one of the aspects
5966860	5971820	that you know entertain me and you know engage me to the point that i actually did the walking dead
5971820	5976860	i love that zombies by and large are a manageable threat you know you and an explorable one i mean
5976860	5982220	you've explored them in so many ways that because you've got to just like right and right you you've
5982220	5987020	got to think over and over again we'll get sick of it eventually but but it's only a matter of
5987020	5992620	time now it's you know it's it's fascinating to think about this you know unrelenting like sea of
5992620	5997340	danger that's out there and you know if you keep your wits about you and you plan well you can do
5997340	6003020	fine but yeah i'm gonna retire i'm gonna retire i'm gonna have that death where that doesn't end
6003020	6011100	in that one shot where you go ah your intestines are dragged apart like a taffy bar i'm gonna be
6011100	6016940	the one human being left that doesn't i did i did i do i like my other favorite thing since i'm
6016940	6023580	this drunk is the beginning of dawn of the dead the 70s one where it's just like it's such a freaky
6023580	6029020	no not the apartment building that stuff's creepy fun tv station it's the tv station that she's
6029580	6035980	she's waking up what's her name poly it's just like it's that she's the eyes in and it's just
6036780	6043180	it i love that the black and white one they worshiped the television because if the television
6043180	6047740	could just tell us what was going on and where we should go and then they worship their one
6047740	6052620	card it's like this perhaps unintentional but spot-on resonant cultural thing of like
6053260	6059660	it's black and white it's it has its roots in old school classic horror films but it's
6059660	6066460	fucking so raw and powerful because it's just fear and it's just like there's a black guy in
6066460	6071340	the house it's almost a bigger problem than there's dead people outside eating brains and
6071340	6076140	the young people understand that that's counterproductive and the and the guy with
6076140	6081740	the control of the hammer and nails doesn't and and that if we could just get this tv working
6081740	6086620	oh the tv's like oh the tv gotta we gotta get it working and that the idea that you fade in on
6086620	6093180	the sequel at the tv station and it's full color now and it's like it's 70s and everyone's got
6093180	6097820	bell bottoms and smokes weed but like you're pretending that the narrative just they work in
6097820	6105980	television where you're learning that this is the apocalypse will not be manageable by anybody
6105980	6108780	all right sorry i'm sorry to your children i'm sorry to our listeners
6111100	6115420	have you seen train to busan no i have not oh that was really awesome that was really good
6115420	6121580	it's uh it's uh korean i believe zombie movie it's it's really great i recommend that okay
6121580	6126060	they keep making good zombie movies i i'll be the first person that i can easily just go like too
6126060	6132060	many zombie movies zombies are dead no pun intended but like is it but i'll watch i keep
6132060	6136140	watching them and then it doesn't it's almost like it's like road movies you know it doesn't
6136140	6140780	matter that there's a thousand of them it's like like like there'll just be some swedish
6140780	6145340	zombie movie they go in waves though i mean there was like we didn't see zombie movies for
6145340	6150620	a really long time and then they came back and then it's like vampires you know it's like like
6150620	6157340	undead stuff it goes like i mean why do you think that is that like what is it about society that
6157340	6162060	makes us fascinated with like the undead and living dead like that for like an amount of time
6162060	6169180	and then we move on to something else i don't know i mean i think it's uh i don't know you
6169340	6173340	like you got like one that's like super popular you're like a 28 days later yeah and then that
6173340	6176860	begets like a land of the dead and a dawn of the dead remake and a bunch of different stuff and
6176860	6181820	then it becomes so popular that they start making crappy ones and then people are like
6181820	6186540	uh let's let this rest for a couple months yeah and then then they come back i feel like that's
6186540	6191340	the cycle i don't think there's any kind of like societal like oh people are like feel guilty about
6193020	6198700	all the horrible things that we're doing overseas and to get iphones and these are
6199660	6204540	the dead people coming to get us there's no living nightmare i don't think i don't think
6204540	6208940	most people are aware of all the horrible things we do to get iphones too i don't go to like like
6208940	6214300	a lot of action movies or like um what the hell you say superhero movies or zombie movies whatever
6214300	6221820	black panther is really burning up the charts top six top six oh boy my button didn't work too
6223660	6228540	it is a weird genre that that's become a giant thing that there's this inundation of like
6228940	6233100	zombie stuff like that's that that is weird that there's so much of it well it kind of is
6233100	6239420	verging on into the ninth season of walking dead and the 900th indie movie about like
6240060	6243660	well my relationship's not going that well because there's a zombie attack like it's
6244940	6250940	as many shitty ones as there are sure it's kind of verging on the hip-hop thing where it's like
6250940	6256860	you wanted to say like if you were waiting for it to be over that rap was a fad and then it's
6256940	6262220	like at certain point you just went this is a genre this is not a thing this is not something
6262220	6268700	and it's like i i think it's just that we don't have a healthy uh it's our our technology means
6268700	6276620	conquering death in a in a in the get it out of your living room way and so it's like although
6276620	6283820	vampires will always have their um attraction they'll be rooted in as has been said since the
6284780	6293740	the silent movie days that it's there's a sexuality there it's about them being humans that uh seduce
6293740	6300220	and attract and manipulate and things and then there's these there's werewolves but we don't
6301260	6306220	werewolves were popular for like the tiniest stint and it's like that's like a Jekyll and Hyde thing
6306220	6312300	where it's like oh i i'm fascinated with the idea that we can all at the drop of a hat turn into a
6312300	6319100	fucking horrible hulk monster that just wants to eat your face it's like it's not a it doesn't take
6319100	6328220	off the way saying everyone's dead everyone that touches you will make you dead then you'll be
6328220	6333740	dead but you'll never be dead because you can't be dead you'll just want to make other things dead
6333740	6339500	you're you're a consumer in an in a sea of consumption and you'll just want to consume
6339580	6345100	and for all you know aren't even if you're not already one of them don't you wish you were
6345820	6352860	aren't they winning isn't it just it's just it's been the non-stop like it's like waves of it come
6352860	6359020	and go but it's like mounting in its appeal as a genre it's almost like 30 years from now
6359740	6366300	there'll just be zombie channels zombie zombie will just be oh i gotta get on that no i mean
6366300	6371740	i think one of the things that does give zombies an edge over werewolves and vampires and things
6371740	6376940	like that is that you know those stories are always about a person who's become a vampire
6376940	6382780	a person who's become a werewolf but you don't do stories about the zombies every zombie story is
6382780	6387340	about the people in the story and the zombies just window dressing so the genre i think lives on
6387340	6390780	because you can be like well there's some soldiers in iraq and they're doing this and then zombies
6390860	6396140	show up you know there's some people at a baseball game in new york and zombies show up like you take
6396140	6401260	nazi's story lachi's looking for buried jewish gold during world war ii and then zombies come
6401260	6406460	out of the car yeah it's aliens invade and then zombies show up but zombies are also or at least
6406460	6410940	like the stories that you tell with zombies they're also kind of involved in the stories we have
6410940	6416940	in general anyway right it's like there's still you're trying to find food shelter safety it's
6416940	6423420	like it's it's like all the the fears we have about real life apply more with zombies like
6423420	6429260	someone randomly could just kill you like if you go outside it is dangerous you actually do have
6429260	6435100	to go find food to survive otherwise your kids will end up dead like it's it's a very extreme
6435100	6441500	version of like all these is not working especially all this capitalist stuff though right like the
6441500	6448060	idea it's like we there is no more infrastructure like there are no more gas stations or refineries
6448060	6453180	that like like that i think are these fears that come naturally out of like living living under
6453180	6458700	the shadow of corporations with a with a with a group of people just for survival could be the
6458700	6463820	thing that kills you that was the thing about donna the dead that was really scary is that
6463820	6470300	like how quickly the system fails you know when there's this weird thing that no one can explain
6470300	6476700	or take care of happens and everybody turns against each other and you don't trust anybody
6476700	6484460	and it's like you know like the cops are shooting each other because zombies don't have garlic they
6484460	6490540	don't have uh wooden stakes you have to put through their heart i like they're thwarted
6490540	6496940	by locking the door which is our kryptonite because it means we have to be with each other
6497900	6505180	it's like fucking great yeah i mean it's uh it's a sartre especially with donna the day of the dead
6505180	6512060	it's like like the real threat is is the people inside that are like ready to shoot you because
6512060	6516940	you're not pulling your weight or or they just want to or they're just like or the people that
6516940	6520700	lose their minds and open the door for all the others yeah yeah do you think an argument could
6520700	6525180	be made the next time you do a panel maybe you could mention this sure you were about to get
6525180	6531580	sick and tired of zombies and we really brought you back we kind of we kind of made another three
6531580	6536780	seasons of walking dead happen harmotown saved the walking dead so i was definitely on the edge but
6536780	6540860	now you guys have got the wheels turning this was sort of an it's the it's a wonderful we're we're
6540860	6547260	good till season 16 now yeah so that's good you're welcome to the people listening that also
