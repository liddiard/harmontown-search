0	29000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, the eponymous Dan Harman.
30000	35000	Doritos! Doritos!
36000	40000	It's a crunchy, salty, cheesy snack.
41000	44000	You've just taken to bring your Doritos half-eaten on stage with you now.
44000	48000	We've got financial troubles, Jeff. We need to start advertising. Or else.
50000	55000	We are in more dire straits than a person that doesn't drive a Honda.
59000	64000	Google it. Do you want to do your Doritos jingle now, or do you want to save it for later?
65000	67000	Let's do it now. Let's get it out of the way.
68000	72000	I don't mean get it out of the way like it's bad to advertise.
73000	77000	Let's give people the opportunity to learn about Doritos at the top of the show.
78000	82000	Dan, when I think about getting Doritos out of the way, I think I'm getting them off the table and into my mouth.
83000	86000	Right. And that's the name of this song, Into My Mouth.
86000	89000	And... Dan Harman, Doritos had. Take one.
89000	90000	Yep.
95000	100000	Into my mouth, into my mouth
101000	107000	You've got a corn chip and soothed-in-doors powder going to my mouth
108000	113000	Little triangles of joy, juicy triangles of joy
113000	116000	Why'd I call them juicy? They're never juicy
118000	121000	Doritos in my mouth
124000	127000	And fuck the queen. Fuck the queen.
128000	132000	And just in keeping with genre, Doritos does not have any opinion about the monarchy.
132000	135000	But staying in genre, fuck the queen.
135000	136000	Doritos in your mouth.
136000	139000	I guess, speaking of getting out of the way, we should just do our Honda ad.
139000	141000	You mentioned Honda, we should just do Honda.
141000	143000	Okay, Honda, Honda, right.
147000	150000	The power of dreams
150000	153000	The power of dreams
153000	159000	You know what I mean when you drive a machine that gets you into your heart
159000	164000	Honda is a machine that you have beaten
164000	168000	Four-cylinder, six-cylinder, eight-cylinder
168000	171000	Sixty-six B-A-B-9 anti-lock brakes
171000	174000	Safety standards compliant
174000	180000	The tough 2019 airbags sold that used to statistically die less
180000	183000	Or at least within the margins of insurance
191000	195000	So thank you to those guys. Make sure you tweet them and let them know
195000	198000	I love Harman Town and I love your think
198000	202000	As fans of something, your job is to keep us alive
202000	205000	Otherwise you failed
205000	211000	How do we justify these incredibly lucrative sponsors like Doritos and Honda
211000	214000	And still be charging people for our new subscriptions?
214000	215000	How does that work?
215000	219000	Everyone's getting Doritos that subscribes
220000	222000	You get Doritos
223000	227000	There's a person, if you're a student, there's a person coming to your school
227000	231000	And he's like a clown, but he's got orange triangles
233000	236000	He's being workshopped right now, he doesn't have a name yet
236000	238000	He's the untitled Doritos spokesmodel
238000	241000	I think the working title is Juicy, the Doritos clown
241000	245000	They're working on stuff based on just like people's feelings about things
245000	249000	Like right now they're thinking of calling him just like Outrage
250000	254000	His name is Outrage the Doritos happy person
254000	258000	And he's going to come to your school and he's going to give you shit
259000	260000	If you're a student
260000	262000	He's going to give you shit, like get on your case
262000	263000	He's going to get on your case
263000	265000	He's going to be like, do your homework, bitch
266000	270000	And then he'll apologize because that's his gimmick
270000	272000	Ronald McDonald did magic tricks
272000	275000	Outrage the happy triangle
276000	277000	He apologizes
277000	279000	Outrage the happy triangle
279000	282000	He apologizes for everything
283000	285000	I like Outrage the happy triangle a lot
285000	289000	Alright, so you probably have noticed already that I'm on painkillers
289000	292000	And that I combined it with drinking
292000	295000	And that I've been signing stuff for the Rick and Morty signing
295000	297000	Are you drunk during a show?
297000	300000	Sorry Jeff, Jeff's got a high standards for this
301000	302000	I would like to apologize
302000	305000	I was rotten as a fucking chap last week
306000	309000	It was what my therapist calls informed consent
309000	310000	That's the phrase she always uses
310000	311000	Informed consent
311000	312000	We knew you were going to be drunk
312000	313000	I warned you
313000	315000	I warned you like three days in advance
315000	316000	Like should we do a show in Israel?
316000	318000	Yeah, I didn't say don't come to the show if you're drunk
318000	319000	I said no
319000	321000	If I had my wits about me I would have called him sick
321000	322000	Because I was worthless
322000	325000	It was, I really, I owe you all an apology
325000	328000	Or thank you because I was, oh you're welcome
329000	330000	Whatever you want
330000	332000	You got it from everybody
332000	334000	I remember licking a lot of balls in Shadowrun
334000	335000	I know that
337000	340000	The thing is sadly I wasn't in a blackout
340000	342000	I remember every bit of that show
342000	344000	That's what really breaks my heart
345000	347000	I'm on painkillers because I had a biopsy
347000	350000	Dan I was talking about, I was talking about myself
351000	352000	Sorry, go ahead
352000	356000	I have, for those who would listen for free to the show
356000	359000	I just revealed a stab wound inflicted on me
359000	362000	By government funded assassins
363000	366000	Called doctors who examined me
366000	368000	For that sound I make when I laugh
370000	372000	Wait, I'm cured
375000	377000	Wait, okay, this is right
380000	381000	There it is, there it is
381000	384000	It's like a bicycle spoke
384000	386000	I'm pretty sure if any of us tried it that hard
386000	388000	Three times we'd make the same sound
389000	390000	Let's all try it at once
390000	391000	One, two, three
392000	394000	Oh yeah, there's a couple
395000	397000	I went in for that sound
397000	399000	And then that sound they said like
399000	400000	Well let's take some x-rays
400000	401000	And then they're like
401000	402000	Well your lymph nodes are enlarged
402000	404000	So we should check out your lymph nodes
404000	405000	Enlarge, blah blah blah
405000	406000	We're going to do this test
406000	407000	You should meet the specialist
407000	408000	Well the specialist says you should do this test
408000	410000	Well this test indicates to the specialist
410000	411000	That you should do a specialist specialist
411000	412000	You should go to this guy
413000	416000	And so like a million dollars later I'm sure
417000	418000	They're just like
418000	420000	Oh we're going to need to go inside to your chest
420000	422000	And pull out some stuff from your lungs
422000	423000	And we're going to do a biopsy
423000	424000	And I was like
424000	425000	Well what's wrong?
425000	426000	And he's like
426000	427000	Well you put it off so much
427000	428000	That if it was cancer you'd be dead by now
428000	429000	So you're fine
431000	432000	And I was like
432000	433000	Okay good to know that
433000	434000	Yes, okay good
435000	437000	And also I was like
437000	439000	And then we'll find out why I make the sound when I laugh
439000	440000	And the doctor was like
440000	441000	What?
441000	442000	No, no
442000	444000	No, that sound you just make now
446000	448000	It was like a Louis C.K. bit
448000	449000	He's just like
449000	450000	No, you're just shitty
450000	451000	You just make that sound now
451000	452000	That's never
452000	454000	That's not a disease
454000	456000	That's not inhibiting your ability to live
456000	458000	We don't care about that sound you make
458000	460000	What are you doing?
460000	462000	Why are you cutting me open?
462000	463000	To get cells
463000	466000	To verify that you don't have something
466000	469000	They're just spending money
469000	470000	They're just giving each other money
470000	472000	Did they give you the all clear?
472000	473000	No
473000	474000	They're never going to
474000	475000	They're just
475000	476000	The imagination of people who are just like
476000	477000	We're just like
477000	483000	We're like cattle that are also wearing farmer hats
483000	486000	Like we're a farm of farmers
486000	489000	We're a farmer farm
489000	495000	Put that in your paperback Orwell
495000	496000	Fuck animal farm
496000	500000	What about farmer farm?
500000	506000	Floon mine for rent
506000	508000	And they gave me painkillers because it hurts
508000	510000	Because they stabbed me in the throat while I was sleeping
510000	511000	Show them the wound
511000	512000	Show them the thing
512000	513000	Find the camera
513000	514000	Find the camera
514000	515000	I'm not complaining
515000	517000	We have a lot of Harmontown fans who are like
517000	520000	My leg is where my arm should be
520000	521000	I'm not
521000	524000	Like we have
524000	527000	We are a community of misfits
527000	529000	Including the medical misfits who are like
530000	532000	How big is the incision in your throat?
532000	533000	I don't know
533000	535000	It's like the size of a Capri Sun straw
535000	536000	Like they just
536000	537000	I don't know
537000	538000	I haven't looked under here
538000	539000	It just hurt
539000	540000	Like I woke up
540000	542000	And they put like a little like endoscope kind of thing
542000	545000	Yeah, they put something down there to like collect cells out of my lymph nodes
545000	546000	And it's got little like grabby bits on it?
546000	548000	It's got little like cell sized grabby bits
548000	549000	Yeah
549000	550000	And they just go scoop
550000	551000	Yeah, I guess
551000	552000	But then you wake up and it's like
552000	556000	If you wake up and it feels like somebody just took a cheese grater
556000	557000	To like the inside of your
558000	560000	Like a cylindrical cheese grater
560000	561000	It's just like
561000	562000	It went like this
562000	563000	Again, I'm not complaining
563000	564000	Because I
564000	565000	Again, like childbirth
565000	566000	I mean like
566000	568000	It's just not a thing
568000	569000	This is my
569000	570000	This was my first surgery
570000	571000	Like I
571000	572000	It wasn't even barely a surgery
572000	574000	It was like a fucking scopy
574000	575000	You know
575000	576000	Like it was an
576000	577000	Outpatient thing
577000	578000	So
578000	579000	But
579000	580000	As George Collins said
580000	581000	Your first surgery
581000	582000	They call it a procedure
582000	583000	Right
583000	585000	Yeah
585000	586000	This was like
586000	587000	I was like
587000	588000	I was like
588000	589000	I don't want to
589000	590000	I don't want to
590000	591000	I don't want to
591000	592000	I don't want to
592000	593000	I don't want to
593000	594000	I don't want to
594000	595000	I don't want to spend my last
595000	596000	I don't want to spend my last moments with these people
596000	597000	It was like
597000	598000	You know when you get on an airplane
598000	599000	And you're like
599000	600000	You're like
600000	601000	Oh God
601000	602000	I know
602000	603000	I know it's not likely to die at an airplane
603000	604000	But like
604000	605000	The terrifying thing is that
605000	606000	If you do
606000	607000	You die with these people
607000	608000	These people
608000	609000	These shitty people
609000	611000	These shitty Reese Witherspoons
611000	612000	Like
612000	613000	Like
613000	614000	Yeah, could you at this point in time
614000	615000	Could you put your thing
615000	616000	Like
616000	617000	Oh we're dying
617000	618000	Bye
618000	620000	I'm your last person
620000	621000	Bye
621000	623000	I'm the face of God
623000	624000	Bye
624000	625000	Bye
625000	626000	Bye
626000	627000	I'm a person in a costume
627000	629000	I'm a fucking bureaucratic idiot
629000	631000	I'm a parasite
631000	632000	Bye
632000	633000	Bye
633000	634000	At this point in time
634000	635000	At this point in time
635000	636000	We'd like to remind you
636000	637000	We'd like to remind you
637000	638000	Everything that an airline tells you
638000	640000	They'd like to remind you
640000	641000	We'd like to remind you
641000	643000	Is subliminal code
643000	644000	For you're a piece of shit
644000	645000	You forgot something
645000	647000	I didn't forget shit
647000	650000	It ain't hard to get on a metal tube
650000	651000	And get launched into the air
651000	652000	And then land
652000	653000	I didn't forget anything
653000	655000	I'm a fucking genius
655000	657000	I'd like to remind you
657000	658000	I'm a fucking human being
658000	659000	Not force majeure
659000	660000	Like
660000	661000	At this point in time
661000	662000	We'd like to remind you
662000	664000	That we do have a really full flight
664000	665000	I don't know how that happened
665000	666000	Whoa
667000	669000	Fucking hate airlines
669000	670000	They're fucking
670000	672000	They're a criminal organization
672000	673000	It's a fucking cartel
674000	676000	Look up the definition of cartel
676000	677000	I've bent over this
677000	678000	Look it up
679000	681000	Look up the word cartel in the dictionary
681000	683000	And then look at what airline companies are
683000	684000	Have you ever been on a plane
684000	685000	When you looked around
685000	686000	And the people around you
686000	687000	And thought, no
687000	688000	This is a good plan to go down
688000	690000	No, because it's always staffed with these people
690000	691000	You've got one guy in the front
691000	692000	That's like
692000	693000	I'm this guy
693000	694000	At this point in time
694000	696000	I'd like to remind you
696000	697000	At this point in time
697000	699000	I'm talking about the other passengers
699000	700000	Not the staff
700000	701000	The fuck other passengers
701000	702000	Who cares
703000	704000	What do you like look over
704000	705000	And I'm like, oh my god
705000	706000	That's
706000	707000	Oh, that's Jennifer Jason Lee
707000	708000	And she's like
708000	709000	Hey, let's die
713000	715000	I will see you at Jennifer Jason Lee
715000	717000	And raise you at George Takei
717000	719000	I would love to die with George Takei
719000	720000	We're like
720000	721000	It's pronounced Takei
721000	722000	Takei
722000	723000	Mr. Takei
723000	724000	We had Sulu on our flight
724000	725000	And everyone's like
725000	726000	Fuck it
726000	727000	We're not dying under any circumstances
727000	728000	Like Sulu's guy
728000	730000	I would follow George Takei anywhere
730000	731000	Including death
731000	733000	Did I ever say on the show what he said
733000	735000	He got on the plane right in front of me
735000	737000	He was checking in to get on board
737000	739000	And there was like a
739000	740000	Like
740000	741000	It was kind of like
741000	742000	Not kind of
742000	744000	He was a very out gay black guy
744000	746000	Who was the guy that was working the tickets
746000	747000	And checking you in
747000	748000	He goes, okay, thank you, Mr. Proups
748000	749000	Thank you, Mr. So-and-so
749000	750000	And he goes, oh, Mr. Takei
750000	751000	What a pleasure
751000	753000	And he goes, oh, thank you
754000	756000	And the guy said, Mr. Takei
756000	758000	I had the pleasure of seeing you on an episode
758000	759000	Of Big Bang Theory last night
759000	760000	Or something like that
760000	761000	Or some show
761000	762000	And he goes, oh, that's very good news
762000	764000	Because I can expect a residual
766000	767000	He's the man
767000	768000	He's great
768000	769000	And then he got on the plane
769000	770000	And he had kind of a cough
770000	771000	And his boyfriend
771000	772000	Or like a companion or whoever
772000	773000	Husband
773000	774000	Husband? Is that right?
774000	775000	Yeah
775000	776000	I don't know
776000	777000	He was just
777000	778000	He was being attended to
778000	779000	And it was lovely
779000	780000	And like
780000	781000	Everyone on the plane was like
781000	782000	This is the best
782000	783000	They're a very cute couple
783000	784000	And I've said this
784000	785000	I've said this on the show
785000	786000	I just want to reiterate
786000	787000	George Takei is an American hero
787000	788000	Here's why
788000	789000	He was born in this country
789000	790000	Twice, twice in one lifetime
790000	792000	Like two times given the excuse
792000	793000	To give up on this country
793000	796000	Because he was born in Japanese America
796000	797000	And locked up in a camp
797000	800000	He didn't let that make him jaded
800000	802000	And then during his acting career
802000	804000	He had to be in the closet
804000	806000	Because you had to be in the closet back then
806000	807000	You just had to
807000	810000	And still
810000	812000	And then to have gay marriage challenge
812000	813000	And all that stuff
813000	815000	He never just went
815000	816000	Did the easy thing
816000	817000	Which is fun for all of us
817000	818000	Which is just be like
818000	819000	Fuck society
819000	820000	Fuck this
820000	823000	He always meets it with this ardor
823000	824000	And goes like
824000	827000	Well I'd prefer if it was something like this
827000	828000	And I'm going to read you
828000	830000	I'd like you to listen to this letter
830000	831000	I'm going to read
831000	833000	He's a good activist
833000	834000	A good guy
834000	837000	I've never been fucked over by society once
837000	838000	And I hate it
838000	843000	I've never had anything but privilege shoved up my ass
843000	845000	With a silver turkey baster
846000	849000	And I'm sick of everybody
849000	851000	And they can go fuck themselves
851000	852000	Maybe that's the key
852000	856000	Maybe you need to have a little bit of people shitting on you from birth
856000	861000	In order for you to realize how lucky you are to be an American
861000	862000	And how worth it it is
862000	866000	Even when the dream is kind of sitting over there like a pile of shit
866000	868000	That it's still worth something
868000	870000	Because the dream exists
870000	874000	I think you also do have to be sort of a special person to rise up from that
874000	876000	Are you calling a retarded?
876000	878000	It's fucked up, dude
878000	880000	I'm on painkillers, I'm sorry
880000	882000	What brand of painkiller are you on?
882000	883000	Retardinal
883000	885000	Retardinal?
887000	890000	They rarely prescribe retardinal anymore
890000	894000	I know, they said you're going to be in stupid pain
894000	897000	My sister's retarded, fuck you
899000	901000	Try having a retarded sister
905000	908000	I love the fake high road
908000	911000	You think it was hard to listen to me talk like that?
911000	914000	Try having a retarded sister
917000	919000	What are you on exactly? What's it called?
921000	925000	And I'm almost certain you're not supposed to have kettle one alongside it
925000	928000	I know, I looked it up, it says it doesn't have a seat of benefit
928000	930000	So it's not like bad for your liver
930000	932000	I have been drinking with these painkillers
933000	936000	But I am in pain, they did stab me in my sleep
936000	938000	For money
939000	942000	So then when I wake up in the morning
946000	948000	Oh boy, it's so complicated
949000	951000	Alright, we have some special guests here tonight
951000	955000	And special in the aforementioned sense
957000	959000	Our next guest brought to you by Retardinal
963000	965000	What was I talking about?
965000	968000	It's some pill
968000	971000	Is it narcole or narcole?
971000	972000	Narco?
972000	975000	Which just seems like a generic
975000	978000	Narco is like a super duper painkiller
978000	979000	That's heavy duty
979000	981000	But then on the bottle it says hydro something
981000	983000	It doesn't matter, it really doesn't matter
983000	985000	It feels good, it feels great
985000	987000	And I was in pain, so I took the pill
987000	989000	And then I drank, so here you have me
989000	992000	So just deal with it, as Dr. Phil would say
992000	996000	As the great Dr. Phil would say
996000	998000	I just want to talk about a couple things, okay?
998000	999000	Do you mind?
1001000	1003000	Okay, thank you for coming tonight
1003000	1004000	Game of Thrones is on tonight
1004000	1005000	Thank you
1005000	1007000	That makes you all heroes
1008000	1011000	You are all, like if you were on Game of Thrones
1011000	1015000	You'd all be the big tall lesbian lady
1016000	1018000	In my eyes
1020000	1021000	My favorite character
1021000	1022000	What's her name?
1022000	1024000	I don't know her name, Brie
1024000	1025000	It's Brie, right?
1025000	1026000	Brie Ann
1026000	1027000	Brie Ann, yeah
1027000	1029000	It's possible to have watched it and be here right now, right?
1029000	1031000	Raise a show of hands or applause
1031000	1033000	If people watch it already
1034000	1037000	By the same people, applause, was it good?
1039000	1041000	It's Game of Thrones, it's beyond that
1041000	1042000	You can't like, Tim
1042000	1045000	This Game of Thrones is a little salty
1046000	1048000	Like, forget that
1049000	1051000	Game of Thrones is always juicy
1052000	1055000	Which is why it's brought to you by Dorito
1057000	1062000	When you have a orange triangle
1062000	1065000	And it's covered in powder
1065000	1067000	That dehydrates you
1067000	1070000	And sends chemicals to your brain
1070000	1072000	That make you crave the soft drinks
1072000	1075000	Manufactured by the same company
1076000	1078000	Because we're all slaves
1079000	1081000	And fuck the queen, but also
1082000	1083000	Doritos
1083000	1086000	How come the fuck the queen part never makes it in until the music is over?
1086000	1088000	It's just, it's there for, it's just genre
1088000	1091000	Like, it's like, Doritos is going for a new campaign this year
1091000	1095000	It's like, it's fuck the queen of your hunger
1098000	1101000	But they don't, they don't want to Mickey Mouse it
1101000	1103000	Like, they don't want it to be in the songs
1103000	1105000	But it's just like, fuck the, fuck the queen of your hunger
1105000	1106000	It's like a punk
1106000	1107000	Like, you're punk
1107000	1109000	You hate the queen
1109000	1110000	You're hungry
1110000	1111000	But you don't want to fuck
1111000	1113000	Yeah, because, because, uh
1113000	1116000	Frito-Lay is, was always, God save the queen of your hunger
1116000	1118000	They were, they were royalists in that regard
1118000	1119000	Yeah, they love it
1119000	1121000	Yeah, it's like, go, go see the, yeah
1121000	1123000	This is the crown jewel of your hunger
1123000	1125000	The, the, this is like, their new campaign is like
1125000	1128000	Doritos, you're gonna start seeing these commercials on the internet
1128000	1130000	They call them web-merchles
1130000	1133000	There's like, fancy British people and they're like
1133000	1138000	Would you pass me the Salisbury Steak, please, Lord Governor
1138000	1142000	Oh, yes, I would within, all who I'd eat
1142000	1145000	And then Macho Randy Savage comes through the wall
1145000	1147000	And goes like, what the fuck are you doing?
1147000	1150000	Did you say Nacho Randy Savage?
1150000	1154000	He's, he's, he's, he's not, he's
1154000	1156000	Did you hear that, or did you say Nacho Randy Savage?
1156000	1160000	I misspoke, but the truth is that he is now
1160000	1162000	He sold Nacho Doritos?
1162000	1164000	He's now Nacho Randy Savage
1164000	1166000	It's like when Sergeant Slaughter joined G.I. Joe, but like
1166000	1167000	Oh, that breaks your heart
1167000	1169000	Yeah, he's now Nacho, yeah
1169000	1171000	I mean, I, yeah, it does break your heart
1171000	1174000	I can't believe he sold out
1174000	1176000	Like that, I can't believe it
1176000	1179000	I used to think Macho Randy Savage
1179000	1183000	I guess, I'm talking about pre-Slim Jim Randy Savage
1183000	1187000	Yeah, when they could, yeah, the American Psycho Christian Bale
1187000	1189000	Like, they've already got his teeth fixed
1189000	1191000	Okay, alright, anyways, Game of Thrones
1191000	1192000	Thanks for being here
1192000	1194000	As Game of Thrones fans and Harmontown fans
1194000	1196000	You've made a sacrifice that should surely be rewarded
1196000	1197000	I'm sure
1197000	1199000	Uh, I'm gonna get an Apple Watch
1199000	1200000	Fuck you, I don't care
1200000	1201000	Stop yelling at me
1203000	1204000	I don't care
1204000	1205000	If Apple made Kleenex, I would get it
1205000	1207000	I would blow my nose in it
1207000	1208000	And then it would go like
1208000	1209000	Okay, did the Apple Kleenex work?
1209000	1210000	Like, I don't have a car
1210000	1211000	Fuck you
1212000	1213000	I don't care, I'm not pa
1213000	1215000	There's no other company that bothers to like
1215000	1218000	Try to like design shit with the consumer in mind
1219000	1221000	And it is for like rich shitty people
1221000	1222000	What does the Apple Watch
1222000	1223000	Because I've only seen like images of it
1223000	1224000	It's just sort of like
1224000	1226000	It truly is useless
1226000	1227000	Of course it's useless
1228000	1229000	So is Twitter
1229000	1231000	Like, remember when everyone was like joking about Twitter
1231000	1233000	Like, what purpose does Twitter serve?
1233000	1234000	I don't know
1234000	1235000	But like, I know that like
1235000	1236000	Like, when I
1236000	1237000	You know, our watches
1237000	1238000	We don't wear watches anymore
1238000	1239000	Because we have these phones
1239000	1240000	But it's like you dig in your pocket
1240000	1241000	You pull out these things
1241000	1242000	Remember before watches
1242000	1244000	They had these pocket watches
1244000	1245000	That's where we are now
1245000	1247000	Your phone has become a pocket watch
1247000	1250000	So now we have to go forward into the 80s
1250000	1251000	And have a
1251000	1253000	A tinier phone on our wrist
1253000	1255000	That can just let us know what time it is
1255000	1257000	And if we have any text messages
1257000	1259000	Without having to pull our phone out of our pocket
1259000	1260000	I'm getting one, fuck you
1260000	1261000	I'm gonna get one
1261000	1263000	I'm gonna wear it discreetly
1263000	1266000	Like, under long sleeves during the winter
1267000	1268000	Because I am a little embarrassed
1268000	1270000	I don't wanna be the only guy
1270000	1273000	Have you ever seen somebody walking around with them currently?
1273000	1274000	No, they're just
1274000	1275000	Oh, that doesn't even happen
1275000	1276000	They just came out
1276000	1277000	So I haven't seen them yet
1277000	1278000	I can't wear a watch
1278000	1280000	So you may have one right now?
1280000	1281000	No? Okay
1281000	1282000	See, they're hot
1282000	1283000	They're hot
1283000	1284000	I can't wear a watch
1284000	1285000	I get too fidgety
1285000	1286000	And I'm also
1286000	1287000	When I was in
1287000	1288000	In the 80s
1288000	1289000	Like, junior high school
1289000	1290000	Or high school
1290000	1291000	I think the last time I wore a watch
1291000	1292000	Was I was a freshman in high school
1292000	1294000	And I would just fidget the whole time
1294000	1296000	And constantly look at my watch
1296000	1297000	That's what you're supposed to do
1297000	1299000	It's called using your watch
1299000	1300000	Yeah, but I was
1300000	1302000	I think I have a bit of OCD
1302000	1304000	Where I kept looking at it
1304000	1305000	And I would divide my day up
1305000	1308000	To ever decreasing, like, fractions of time
1308000	1311000	That's what you're supposed to do
1311000	1313000	It says big watch
1315000	1317000	Let's bring out big watch
1323000	1325000	All right, let's bring out
1325000	1327000	Let's bring them out
1327000	1328000	Let's just bring them out
1328000	1331000	Like, the way you bring a bull out at a rodeo
1331000	1333000	Out of a giant metal gate?
1333000	1335000	Let's bring out Rick and Morty creator
1335000	1337000	Justin Reiland
1350000	1352000	Brought to you by Retardinol
1354000	1355000	Anywhere you want
1355000	1356000	I think if you stick closer to me
1356000	1357000	It works better
1357000	1358000	All right, okay
1359000	1360000	Wow
1360000	1361000	Oh, man
1361000	1362000	Jeff Davis
1362000	1364000	What a sight for sore eyes over there
1364000	1365000	How are you, Mr. Reiland?
1365000	1366000	I'm good
1366000	1367000	Haven't seen you in a while
1367000	1368000	But you don't age at all
1368000	1370000	You look just as boyish and useful as I've ever seen you
1370000	1371000	Well, you know
1371000	1373000	I just sort of build fat
1373000	1376000	Slowly but surely I build fat against my body
1376000	1378000	You look hard as a rock
1379000	1380000	All right
1382000	1383000	Justin, I have a question for you
1383000	1384000	And I'm not joking
1384000	1386000	How do you keep your hair so soft and manageable?
1388000	1391000	Like, I don't wash it for a few days in a row
1391000	1393000	And then, like, I'll sleep on it
1393000	1397000	And then I'll spray it with, like, that dry shampoo spray
1397000	1400000	And then, like, and then I'll wash it
1400000	1404000	And then, like, I won't wash it for, like, three or four days
1405000	1408000	You know, so, like, the cycle repeats and continues

1449000	1450000	Bullshit
1450000	1451000	Bullshit

1470000	1472000	I'm not that crazy
1472000	1475000	Justin, when you say, you mean you're capital D depressed
1475000	1477000	Or is there something on your mind right now
1477000	1479000	I'm not in lower case D depressed, lower case
1479000	1482000	Is there something on your mind right now that is currently depressing to you
1482000	1484000	Or depressing you?
1485000	1486000	Yeah, there is
1486000	1490000	But the sign in the window that said he was here
1490000	1492000	Was like so complicated
1492000	1493000	Wait, what did it say?
1493000	1495000	Robin Williams has been on the show
1495000	1497000	And it didn't have like all the caveats
1497000	1499000	What's that on the, what was on the window?
1499000	1501000	Justin Royal's here
1501000	1503000	It said things we weren't allowed to talk about
1503000	1504000	Like on the sign
1505000	1508000	Royalon is here, but don't tip the ship for him
1508000	1510000	Jesus Christ, fuck, I'm sorry
1511000	1513000	Can I see that? Can I see that, please?
1513000	1515000	Is this your writing, sir?
1515000	1517000	Yeah, this was, this was
1517000	1519000	Let the court, uh
1519000	1521000	See, I wrote this
1521000	1522000	Let me see what I wrote
1522000	1524000	Royalon is here
1524000	1527000	By the way, this is fucking, your assistant told me to do this
1527000	1529000	What's the ship? What is the ship we can get to?
1529000	1531000	But don't tip the ship
1531000	1533000	I don't know, I'm pretty drunk
1534000	1536000	Pretty, I'm pretty drunk right now
1536000	1537000	And I'm sorry
1537000	1538000	I can't believe it
1538000	1539000	I took it to him
1539000	1540000	I'm not allowed to talk about it
1540000	1541000	Jesus Christ, fuck, I'm sorry
1541000	1543000	Yeah, okay, so let me explain this
1543000	1547000	So, so, so, so what I was going for here was like
1550000	1551000	Okay
1552000	1554000	Do you want some pain colors?
1554000	1555000	Spencer, no, no, no
1555000	1556000	I have more
1556000	1559000	Yes, yes, but no, yes and yes and no
1559000	1561000	But no, Spencer came, came to me and he said
1561000	1564000	Just go stand in the little window and look at Dan
1564000	1567000	And I'm like, I don't want to do, do that
1567000	1570000	He's like doing his bed, he's like, that's like the opening routine
1570000	1571000	Yeah
1571000	1572000	I practiced it for days, yeah
1572000	1574000	I'm not going to stand there like a weirdo and like
1574000	1575000	Lear at him
1575000	1577000	And then he looks at me and goes
1577000	1579000	Oh yeah, just put a, just put a sign
1579000	1581000	Just put a novel on a piece of paper and hold it up
1581000	1583000	So, so I said, so I said
1583000	1585000	So he's like, why don't you write down, like, that you're here
1585000	1587000	And I'm like, oh, okay
1587000	1589000	And I, I was really drunk and I wrote this
1589000	1590000	And I still am
1590000	1594000	And I wrote, Roiland is here but don't tip the ship for him
1594000	1598000	Which means don't stop what you're doing
1598000	1600000	Oh, I thought it meant don't talk about your relationship
1600000	1601000	No
1603000	1604000	No
1604000	1607000	Because you said, you said not to talk about your relationship tonight
1607000	1608000	No, I know, I know
1608000	1610000	But no, all it meant was like don't
1610000	1611000	Don't rock the boat
1611000	1612000	Yeah, yeah, yeah
1612000	1613000	Of his relationship
1613000	1615000	He's been doing the harm in town for a while
1615000	1618000	Don't, don't, don't, don't, you know
1618000	1619000	Don't do anything on my account
1619000	1620000	Exactly
1620000	1625000	Yeah, and then, and then later I wrote Jesus, Christ, fuck, I'm sorry
1625000	1626000	All right
1626000	1630000	And that's just a larger extension of my, where I'm at right now, psychologically, yes
1630000	1634000	What's the depressing news with what, what's going on in your relationship
1634000	1637000	We don't want to get into that shit today
1637000	1640000	Harm in town is about plumbing the rude depths
1640000	1641000	I know
1641000	1644000	Are you having a good love life?
1644000	1645000	I am
1645000	1647000	I love my girlfriend, fiancé
1647000	1648000	My fiancé girlfriend
1648000	1649000	Right
1649000	1650000	I love her
1650000	1651000	When are you going to tie that knot?
1651000	1652000	You proposed for like an 89
1652000	1656000	You know, I'm going for a 10, I'm going for a 10 year engagement
1656000	1657000	I am, I'm going for
1657000	1658000	Like the Will Ferrell movie?
1658000	1659000	Yeah
1659000	1661000	What was the, the Paul Rudd, the Mark Richelot
1661000	1664000	Yeah, I'm going, I'm going for the 10 year engagement
1664000	1670000	Because I think that, you know, screen printed leggings of fucking
1670000	1674000	What the fuck are you wearing, dude?
1674000	1677000	That's Anatoly's wearing special pants
1677000	1679000	Are these Anatoly, god damn you
1679000	1682000	Anatoly, come stand up and show everybody your special pants
1682000	1683000	Are you wearing
1683000	1686000	Somebody like, cameraman zoom in on this
1686000	1689000	Holy fucking shit, the guy that played
1689000	1692000	What's the guy from Jinx? What's the fucking
1692000	1694000	Bobby Durst?
1694000	1696000	He's got Ryan Gosling
1696000	1700000	He's got fucking Ryan Gosling AKA Bobby Durst fucking pants on
1700000	1703000	His buttons are decoupage with Ryan Gosling's face
1703000	1706000	And he just flexed him a little bit
1706000	1708000	And it's only, and it's only, turn around
1708000	1710000	His buttons are like, turn around Mr. Junior's pecs
1710000	1712000	Showing some Russian Ryan Gosling cock
1712000	1714000	There we are, there we are
1714000	1715000	Master stuff
1715000	1719000	That's, we just changed our rating
1719000	1722000	And our religion
1722000	1724000	Yeah, this is the Anatoly I like
1724000	1728000	I don't, I don't like the aloof Anatoly
1728000	1730000	The one where you're wearing the mask and
1730000	1733000	Don't be aloof about me pointing out your aloofness
1733000	1737000	I like the, I like the, I like the out there figure skating Anatoly
1737000	1739000	Anatoly, grab a mic
1739000	1742000	I like the guy that wears like a Hello Kitty hood
1742000	1745000	And then you go like, what's going on with the Hello Kitty
1745000	1748000	And then he goes, what do you mean?
1748000	1751000	What the fuck, what, what?
1751000	1753000	I don't know, what the fuck
1753000	1756000	Ryan Gosling is really fucking attractive
1756000	1758000	You're right, you're right, maybe
1758000	1760000	Anatoly can ask you a personal question
1760000	1762000	You can acquire a pair of
1762000	1766000	The sink, it's called internet
1766000	1770000	There's a sink
1770000	1772000	Called the internet
1772000	1774000	See, I don't like it, I don't like it
1774000	1777000	I don't like this generation, I don't like it
1777000	1780000	See, I mean, see, back in my day
1780000	1784000	When I wanted to pick up some, some Ralph Macchio tights
1784000	1786000	I had to walk into a store and
1786000	1788000	Physically purchase them over the counter
1788000	1789000	Gentlemen
1789000	1790000	And then you have to hurry it come
1790000	1792000	You just carry it home like all the way
1792000	1793000	Yeah
1793000	1795000	And now you have to just sit home and just push the button
1795000	1798000	Where's the pride in what you're doing Anatoly?
1798000	1802000	Where's the pride in ownership of buying your Ryan Gosling prize
1802000	1804000	Who needs pride?
1804000	1805000	It's not about pride
1805000	1806000	Like a thief
1806000	1807000	It's not fucking about pride
1807000	1808000	It should be about pride
1808000	1809000	No, nothing's about pride
1809000	1813000	It's about ease of purchase
1813000	1815000	Wow
1815000	1818000	Yeah, nothing is about pride
1818000	1819000	He's right
1819000	1821000	Look at his knee
1821000	1823000	Look at his knee
1823000	1826000	Make Ryan Gosling go deformed
1826000	1829000	Go ahead, go ahead, gentle
1829000	1832000	Can we get a zoom in on that?
1832000	1833000	I want to see what Anatoly...
1833000	1836000	That is fucking creepy
1836000	1838000	That is fucking creepy
1838000	1840000	Which Ryan Gosling's on your butthole?
1840000	1841000	I want to see this one
1841000	1842000	Yeah, let's go
1842000	1843000	Just fucking run
1843000	1844000	Can we make him talk?
1844000	1845000	Can we make him talk?
1845000	1846000	Is there one that we can make him talk?
1846000	1847000	No, no, no, no
1847000	1850000	Over the line, Jeff
1850000	1853000	Over the line
1853000	1854000	I'm a journalist, Dan
1854000	1855000	I'm a journalist
1855000	1858000	How can you have no respect to Ryan Gosling, dude?
1858000	1859000	No
1859000	1860000	It's fucking Ryan Gosling
1860000	1861000	No, I didn't
1861000	1863000	I don't show the respect that you were showing him
1863000	1868000	I always get Ryan Gosling confused with the other guy
1868000	1869000	The...
1869000	1871000	Ryan Gosling
1871000	1873000	What's his name?
1873000	1874000	Ryan...
1874000	1875000	Oh, Gyllenhaal
1875000	1876000	The little Gyllenhaal
1876000	1877000	Jake Gyllenhaal
1877000	1878000	Jake Gyllenhaal
1878000	1879000	I can't tell the difference between those two
1879000	1881000	Yeah, because their beards are shapeshifting
1881000	1882000	You never know what beard they're going to have
1882000	1885000	Yeah, I just felt that they both came from the same silly putty egg
1885000	1886000	And they're both like
1886000	1888000	Like one of them you went like this
1888000	1892000	And one of them you went like that
1892000	1894000	And they're both like always upset
1894000	1897000	You know what they have in common, though
1897000	1901000	All girls we know want to bone them
1901000	1902000	All right
1902000	1904000	I mean that's everybody
1904000	1905000	Am I wrong ladies?
1905000	1906000	That's everybody
1906000	1911000	Really? You're going to fucking put me up on a witch stick and burn me
1911000	1914000	That's a witch, witch, witch stick
1914000	1915000	Dan and I have a mutual friend
1915000	1917000	This actor named Daniel Gillies is wonderful
1917000	1919000	And he's on like those vampire shows and stuff
1919000	1920000	And he's fantastic
1920000	1923000	And he's friends with Ryan Gosling
1923000	1925000	And for...
1925000	1926000	Name dropper
1926000	1927000	No, no
1928000	1932000	This is me dropping Ryan Gosling on behalf of somebody else
1932000	1933000	I'm kidding
1933000	1935000	For Daniel's birthday party
1935000	1938000	Ryan Gosling did something that I thought was incredibly groovy
1938000	1939000	He showed up at the...
1939000	1941000	With Jake Gyllenhaal
1941000	1942000	And he's like
1944000	1947000	And they just started fucking right in front of everybody
1947000	1950000	And they wore tights with Daniel's picture all over them
1950000	1952000	He came to his birthday party with Jake Gyllenhaal
1952000	1954000	And they took hostages
1955000	1957000	And then both of them kept saying like
1957000	1960000	No, I'm Ryan Gosling
1960000	1961000	To all the party guests
1961000	1964000	All the party guests had to figure out who to shoot
1965000	1967000	They all had guns for some reason
1967000	1969000	And they had hostages which doesn't make any sense
1969000	1971000	As you walked into the party you got a loaded gun
1971000	1972000	Yeah, you got a firearm
1972000	1973000	Alright, what did he really do?
1973000	1974000	He showed up at the...
1974000	1975000	What's it called?
1975000	1976000	The Chateau Marmont
1976000	1978000	And Daniel got to swinging like balcony
1978000	1980000	Like one of the great rooms up there
1980000	1982000	And Ryan Gosling comes in on his own
1982000	1984000	But behind him a...
1984000	1986000	I think a 10 or 12 piece mariachi band
1986000	1987000	That was his gift
1990000	1991000	And they played for half hour
1991000	1992000	And they fucking boned out
1992000	1993000	And that was his gift
1993000	1995000	There was 30 minutes of mariachi
1995000	1996000	Wait, was it his birthday?
1996000	1997000	Can I hear that song again?
1997000	1998000	He brought it for...
1998000	1999000	His gift to Daniel was
1999000	2001000	I brought you music from these guys
2001000	2002000	Oh, oh, it was Daniel's birthday
2002000	2004000	Jeff, can you tell me that song again?
2004000	2006000	My name is Dan Harmon
2006000	2007000	No, no, no, no, no
2007000	2010000	Jeff, the song that they played when they came in
2010000	2011000	I was just...
2011000	2013000	Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop
2015000	2016000	I can't sing
2016000	2017000	I want more though
2017000	2021000	I want chorus, verse, chorus, verse
2021000	2022000	Of that song
2022000	2024000	Anatoli, do you miss the Cold War?
2024000	2025000	Thank you Dan
2027000	2028000	I do, I do
2028000	2029000	I do
2029000	2030000	I was thinking about it today
2030000	2032000	I was talking to my assistant Steve Levy about it
2032000	2033000	And we were like
2033000	2034000	Holy shit man
2034000	2036000	We were just marveling at that 50 year plan we had
2036000	2038000	Before we got into World War II
2038000	2039000	And it was like
2039000	2040000	Fuck man
2040000	2041000	For like 50 years
2041000	2043000	Like the bad guys were just other white people
2043000	2044000	With a backwards alphabet
2046000	2047000	It's fucking amazing
2048000	2051000	And like barely any bloodshed for 50 years
2051000	2053000	Just a bunch of cool movies
2054000	2057000	About like how we all had film in our pens
2057000	2058000	And now it's just like
2058000	2061000	Fucking day of the goddamn dead
2061000	2064000	Anatoli, like in Russia during the Cold War
2064000	2065000	I mean how old are you first off?
2065000	2066000	You're quite young
2066000	2067000	25, 25
2067000	2069000	So you might be too young to answer this well
2069000	2071000	In the 80s for us
2071000	2074000	There were great movies where the Russians were always the great bad guys
2074000	2076000	We saw the decade end
2076000	2080000	When it seems the world would collide with the blink of an eye
2085000	2088000	The show brought to you by Retard and all
2094000	2096000	I was doing that song, that song
2096000	2097000	Remember that song?
2097000	2098000	Oh yeah
2098000	2105000	A woman on the radio said that fruity pebbles were allowed in Germany
2106000	2107000	Keep going?
2107000	2109000	Right, right now
2109000	2113000	Watching the world wake up from history
2114000	2116000	Skritti Politti, who are those guys?
2119000	2122000	In Russia, were there great movies where the Americans were the bad guys?
2122000	2123000	Was that a thing too?
2123000	2125000	No, it wasn't like really big, no
2125000	2126000	I don't think so
2126000	2129000	You guys were just stabbing each other for blue jeans the whole time
2129000	2131000	That was the big secret
2131000	2134000	We were like, oh no, the Russians and they were like, don't tell them
2134000	2136000	Give me some bread
2136000	2139000	No, offensive? Probably
2139000	2141000	Yeah, that's fucked up
2146000	2148000	Yeah, but it was bad over there the whole time
2148000	2149000	Always was
2149000	2152000	They sold counterfeit watches and stuff
2152000	2154000	I mean, that's all they did
2154000	2155000	Right?
2155000	2157000	Right, bro?
2157000	2159000	My joke is that
2159000	2161000	My, you know, the joke was
2162000	2164000	Yeah, please explain
2164000	2167000	Like Dan was going, you know, hardcore
2167000	2168000	Yeah
2168000	2170000	And I was like, oh yeah, I'm gonna go
2170000	2172000	Dustin Orr
2172000	2174000	But also racist
2174000	2176000	Dustin, to continue that
2176000	2178000	Against Russian people
2178000	2180000	Everything I know about Russia I learned from the movie Red Heat
2180000	2182000	with Jim Belushi and Arnold Schwarzenegger
2183000	2185000	That was a hard-hitting documentary
2187000	2189000	Dustin, I think that you should take advantage
2189000	2191000	while we're being racist about Russians
2191000	2195000	to use this Russian intellectual here to explain your depression
2195000	2196000	and what's going on in your life right now
2196000	2198000	I'm just fucking depressed
2198000	2199000	Yeah, so
2199000	2201000	Like I want to kill myself
2201000	2204000	But I'm too scared to do that because
2204000	2207000	I am so frightened
2207000	2210000	of what would happen if I did kill myself
2210000	2212000	You know what I mean? It's like
2212000	2215000	I'm one of those fucking people
2215000	2217000	You chalk me up into that category
2217000	2218000	Wait, what do you mean?
2218000	2220000	Jethophobes
2221000	2223000	The people that want to die
2223000	2226000	but then are so scared of what happens when you die
2226000	2228000	that they're afraid to kill themselves
2228000	2231000	That's me, ladies and gentlemen
2231000	2233000	Alright, Anatolia, how do you deal with that?
2233000	2236000	Yeah, how do you deal with that shit with your fucking
2236000	2238000	frank awesome pants
2239000	2241000	How do you deal with that shit?
2241000	2242000	Uh, okay
2242000	2246000	I want Ryan Gosling to suck on my people
2249000	2250000	So I'm talking, I'm talking, it's funny
2250000	2252000	Sorry, sorry, that's fucked up
2252000	2254000	I'm sorry, that's fucked up
2254000	2257000	That's mean and I'm sorry and I did not mean to offend you
2257000	2259000	Alright, go Anatolia, you have the floor
2259000	2261000	The floor for, okay
2261000	2265000	Then I can have a floor to move my religion
2265000	2267000	It's about what happened after you die
2267000	2268000	Okay
2268000	2270000	Uh, nothing will happen
2270000	2273000	Uh, pretty Russian
2275000	2277000	Nothing will happen
2277000	2278000	Lights out, baby
2278000	2280000	What are you saying, just blackness
2280000	2281000	Blackness
2281000	2282000	But blackness is a thing
2282000	2285000	Dude, I am telling you, man, I don't think that's true
2285000	2287000	I think that when you kill yourself and die
2287000	2289000	or if you die in a car crash
2289000	2291000	or if you fucking whatever, however you die
2291000	2295000	I think that you are reborn in
2296000	2299000	Okay, so I'm kind of hung up on this because
2299000	2302000	So let's say Harmon, you make babies with Aaron, right?
2302000	2304000	Poop out a bunch of babies
2304000	2307000	Those little babies find, let's say they're girls
2307000	2308000	Okay
2308000	2309000	Just follow me
2309000	2311000	So they're girls and they find these boys
2311000	2314000	And the boys are like, I want to fucking fuck that bitch
2314000	2316000	So then the boys fuck your girls
2316000	2317000	And they make little babies
2317000	2318000	And they poop those out, right?
2318000	2319000	Right, okay
2319000	2322000	Okay, so then they go on and you know
2322000	2325000	The fucking circle of life continues
2325000	2326000	And you die
2326000	2327000	Okay
2327000	2330000	So my theory is maybe
2330000	2334000	That you will be reborn in your own lineage
2334000	2335000	Really?
2335000	2336000	Way down the road
2336000	2339000	When the fucking water's gone
2339000	2340000	When we're fucking
2340000	2341000	The planet's burning up
2341000	2343000	And the NASA space station is like
2343000	2345000	Oh shit, we got to hurry up
2345000	2348000	But how will it be me if I'm not able to go like
2348000	2350000	Well, I mean, it'll be you wiped
2350000	2351000	It'll be you
2351000	2352000	Because if you're wiped then you don't exist
2352000	2353000	No, you do though
2353000	2354000	Because it'll be you
2354000	2356000	But all your memories will be wiped
2356000	2358000	So you'll get pooped out of it
2358000	2360000	But who cares about that guy?
2360000	2362000	You will because you're gonna have to fucking live it
2362000	2363000	No, I won't because my memory will be wiped
2363000	2366000	Yeah, but you will because you'll be fucking living it
2366000	2368000	No, you might as well say that about all life
2368000	2370000	That is true about all life
2370000	2371000	That's the beautiful thing
2371000	2374000	I'm not saying you're gonna come back as a blade of grass
2374000	2375000	I'm saying
2375000	2377000	As another guy who is the equivalent of a blade of grass
2377000	2379000	I'm gonna say you're gonna come back as Dan Harmon's
2379000	2381000	Great, great, great, great grandson
2381000	2382000	But he's not gonna
2382000	2387000	And it's gonna be little Danny Harmon pooping out of his vagina
2387000	2388000	And he's gonna be like
2388000	2389000	Oh, I love Danny Harmon
2389000	2391000	Can someone tell him how bodies work?
2391000	2393000	Here I go
2393000	2394000	Oh, I love life
2394000	2396000	And then when you get to like age 20
2396000	2397000	You're gonna be like
2397000	2399000	What the fuck is going on?
2399000	2401000	Like you did in this life
2401000	2402000	And then you're still gonna start to go
2402000	2403000	What the fuck?
2403000	2406000	I'm 20, okay, you're 25, 30, 40
2406000	2407000	Bullshit
2407000	2408000	But that guy never says
2408000	2410000	I had a podcast
2410000	2411000	Well, I never
2411000	2413000	Did I mention a podcast?
2413000	2414000	No, I'm saying like
2414000	2417000	Your identity is based on the idea that you would have
2417000	2418000	You know what you'll have in that day
2418000	2419000	You'll be like
2419000	2422000	I have a scrubby schmast
2422000	2423000	It'll be some weird thing
2423000	2425000	You're not even listening to me
2425000	2426000	Okay, I'm sorry
2426000	2428000	I wanna listen, tell me
2428000	2430000	I wanna understand what you were saying
2430000	2431000	Do you promise you'll listen?
2431000	2432000	Yeah, I swear, I swear
2432000	2434000	Alright
2435000	2438000	If you're reincarnated
2438000	2441000	But the only part that's not reincarnated
2441000	2444000	Is all memory of your previous life
2444000	2446000	That's not reincarnation
2446000	2447000	That's biology
2447000	2450000	Yes, of course my cum goes into a thing
2450000	2451000	And then the cum changes
2451000	2453000	No, but that's not what I'm saying, though
2453000	2455000	Sorry, it's semen
2455000	2456000	Get ready
2456000	2459000	Atoms, molecules, cosmic light
2459000	2461000	What I'm saying is that
2461000	2462000	It's cum is gross
2462000	2463000	I'm saying that
2463000	2464000	You don't have to have a baby
2464000	2466000	That baby goes on whether it's a boy and girl
2466000	2468000	And propriates
2468000	2470000	You don't have to
2470000	2471000	You don't have to
2471000	2473000	I don't wanna be glib about this
2473000	2475000	But you don't have to walk me through this again
2475000	2476000	Alright, fine
2476000	2477000	I know how life works
2477000	2480000	And I know, okay, so that's 70 years from now
2480000	2482000	That's one possibility, by the way
2482000	2483000	One possibility
2483000	2484000	By the way, that's exactly what happens
2484000	2485000	That's what everybody says
2485000	2487000	Who's fortunate enough to live long enough
2487000	2489000	To see grandparents and grandchildren
2489000	2490000	They say you are
2490000	2492000	You're the spitting image of
2492000	2494000	And you have the personality of
2494000	2495000	Your great-grandpa
2495000	2496000	And holy shit
2496000	2498000	You are that motherfucker
2498000	2499000	Maybe
2499000	2500000	One of the progenitors of my family
2500000	2502000	Was like a philosophy major
2502000	2504000	And a curmudgeon
2504000	2505000	And a hermit
2505000	2508000	He lost all his money in the stock market
2508000	2509000	And he was the only other
2509000	2511000	Harmon that went to school
2511000	2512000	I never met him
2512000	2513000	He was like this guy
2513000	2515000	And he was so long dead
2515000	2516000	Before I was ever around
2516000	2517000	But then a couple of old people
2517000	2519000	Were able to say before they died
2519000	2521000	You're just like, so what's up
2522000	2524000	It is reincarnation in that sense
2524000	2526000	Like I am like that guy because
2526000	2527000	There's a fiber there
2527000	2530000	So then the whole thing of like
2530000	2533000	Reproducing and pooping out babies
2533000	2535000	Will maybe fuck some other people
2535000	2538000	And keep fucking and shitting out babies
2538000	2540000	It's a little bit, you know
2540000	2542000	I mean, it's very accurate, yes
2542000	2544000	That's how, yes, that's how life works
2544000	2546000	But Justin, your fear you said is that
2546000	2548000	If you are reincarnated as a poop baby
2548000	2550000	Three generations from now
2550000	2551000	And there's no water
2551000	2552000	And the planet is all crappy
2552000	2554000	What if in the future life
2554000	2557000	Listen, I don't want nothing to do with it
2559000	2561000	You won't have anything to do with it
2561000	2562000	It's not you
2562000	2564000	I'm not having children, okay
2564000	2566000	That's why I'm not shitting babies out
2566000	2568000	You're still going to have just as much to do with it
2568000	2569000	Without having children
2569000	2571000	Because one of their babies is going to be you
2571000	2573000	So let's talk about the other thing, right
2573000	2576000	So you have babies, you poop them out
2576000	2579000	And then, you know, let's say in this crazy weird
2579000	2581000	Magical version of reality
2581000	2585000	Your life, you'll be reincarnated as one of these babies
2585000	2588000	Like so many lines, there are so many things on the line
2588000	2589000	So what's the opposite of that?
2589000	2590000	The opposite of that is you say
2590000	2592000	I'm not going to have, I'm going to have a vasectomy
2592000	2594000	I'm not going to have any fucking kids
2594000	2595000	So then what happens?
2595000	2596000	That's not
2596000	2599000	Then you're in fucking heaven and there's 700 virgins
2599000	2600000	What?
2600000	2601000	That will fuck you
2604000	2605000	You know what I mean?
2607000	2610000	Justin!
2610000	2613000	Only crazy people think that
2613000	2616000	Justin, those are your two, your main two
2616000	2617000	I'm kidding, yours are the fours
2617000	2619000	700
2619000	2621000	I love the idea that you're
2621000	2624000	700 virgin women
2624000	2632000	We'll have sex with you if your parents refuse to procreate
2632000	2633000	Justin, it sounds to me like
2633000	2634000	I'm just kidding
2634000	2637000	It sounds to me like possibly that you're more afraid of not leaving
2637000	2639000	Man, I'm just fucking afraid of everything
2639000	2642000	You do want children, you do want to leave someone behind
2642000	2644000	That's what I'm believing
2644000	2646000	I don't know, I don't know if I can care for another human being
2646000	2648000	I'm scared, I'm just really scared
2648000	2650000	Well you shouldn't have, you don't have kids
2650000	2653000	No one wants you to have kids
2653000	2658000	You should, a lot of people are bummed out you have dogs
2658000	2663000	I talked to a guy tonight that's bummed out you have Legos
2663000	2668000	I didn't say that I love my dogs and I take care of them so well
2668000	2673000	I rescued and saved dogs, but I get it
2673000	2676000	He's a good dog owner, he's a very good dog owner
2676000	2680000	Are you worried about your dogs pooping out babies?
2680000	2685000	I want to check in with the booth, do we have friends back there that are
2685000	2689000	Yeah we do, for God's sake, Anna Tully, go sit down
2689000	2693000	Thank you Anna Tully everybody, thank you Anna Tully
2693000	2696000	Thank you Ryan Gosling
2696000	2701000	I don't know what you guys want, what do you want from me?
2701000	2707000	What do you want? What do you want? That's you
2707000	2710000	What the fuck, what do you want? What do you want from me?
2710000	2712000	I don't know what to want
2712000	2715000	I dress up like a Christmas tree, what do you want?
2715000	2718000	What do you want? That's you
2718000	2720000	Oh shit
2720000	2722000	What do you want from me?
2722000	2726000	No you're not supposed to be able to respond
2726000	2728000	Oh no
2728000	2732000	Our audience says they're learning how to think
2732000	2734000	They're using tools
2734000	2738000	That's like when the Velociraptor doorknob
2738000	2741000	How did the Jurassic World movie go?
2741000	2746000	People are saying it was pretty spot on with my predictions about Jurassic World
2746000	2749000	We should have a screening here
2749000	2754000	Chris Pratt is like the guy who really understands Velociraptors and they him
2754000	2758000	Hey man I know Chris Pratt, that motherfucker ain't joking around
2758000	2762000	I'll tell you one thing, he don't eat no fat
2762000	2765000	Justin and his wife know what I mean
2765000	2769000	Justin can I say something? Do me a favor, will you do me a favor?
2769000	2771000	Do you consider me a pal and a friend?
2771000	2772000	I love you, yeah
2773000	2775000	Do me a favor, just for me
2775000	2777000	Don't kill yourself because I love you
2779000	2785000	I have two days from now you're going to find my body hanging from a noose baby
2785000	2789000	I have something important to say about that and I've said it before
2789000	2792000	We have a young audience and they're hipsters and stuff
2792000	2796000	We all go through a bunch of shit
2796000	2800000	Different phases of your life, no one wants to be told you're growing through a phase
2800000	2802000	Your feelings are your actual feelings
2802000	2805000	The most important thing you can do is talk to somebody about them
2805000	2807000	You have to talk to somebody about them
2807000	2810000	If you have a friend or a family member that you trust
2810000	2811000	You don't have to call
2811000	2815000	What is this Dr. Phil? What am I on a fucking daytime talk show?
2815000	2819000	It's the important thing that you need to say to anybody who is ever having these thoughts
2819000	2822000	The most dangerous thing you can do is let them bounce around in your head
2822000	2826000	Rest assured I have three therapists that have been given to me their numbers
2826000	2828000	I have not called any of them yet
2828000	2831000	I don't know if I will, maybe I will
2831000	2836000	Or maybe I'll fucking blow my goddamn brains out
2836000	2840000	If you do, if we do find you hanging from a noose two days from now
2840000	2842000	I just want to let everyone know I would never do that
2842000	2844000	I'm too scared of death
2844000	2848000	I'm too scared of the whole death thing to be able to actually kill myself
2848000	2852000	So no matter how suicidal I get, I will never kill myself
2852000	2855000	And that is my promise to you
2856000	2858000	You fucking pussy
2860000	2862000	What a stunt
2863000	2865000	Justin Roiland
2865000	2867000	He didn't bounce to not kill himself by it
2867000	2869000	Yes, emotional terrorist
2870000	2873000	Is it our old family friend? Is he here?
2873000	2877000	Okay, not old, I mean his relationship with our show is old
2877000	2878000	What do we got?
2878000	2880000	Curtis Armstrong!
2881000	2885000	Curtis Armstrong brought to you by Honda
2885000	2887000	Hey!
2887000	2889000	Dorito Armstrong!
2890000	2892000	No, you can stay there
2905000	2907000	Thank you, thank you
2907000	2908000	Curtis, hello
2908000	2909000	Nice to be here
2909000	2912000	Curtis, what did I do to deserve a nice yellow tulip?
2912000	2914000	Well, I'll tell you
2914000	2917000	When somebody kisses your balls
2919000	2921000	The way you did me
2922000	2925000	You go out and you buy them a nice gift
2925000	2927000	You see, ladies, is it that hard?
2929000	2932000	Can we learn a little bit from Curtis Armstrong?
2932000	2934000	It had never happened to me before
2934000	2937000	And I've been thinking about it all week
2938000	2942000	So today, on my way here, I stopped to get you a tulip
2942000	2945000	That's lovely. Tulips are among my favorite flowers, Curtis. Thank you very much
2945000	2946000	They're among your favorite flowers?
2946000	2947000	Yes
2947000	2950000	Speaking of romance, I think you said you were going to come with your wife tonight, right?
2950000	2951000	I was going to
2951000	2952000	Your wife?
2952000	2953000	She didn't come
2953000	2957000	I've always been meaning to ask you about your love life
2957000	2960000	You're married, we're...
2960000	2963000	I'm married for 22 years
2964000	2967000	Did you have kids or anything?
2967000	2971000	We have one child, a girl who's 19
2971000	2973000	Did you poop her out?
2973000	2974000	Did you say 19?
2974000	2975000	I didn't
2975000	2977000	I was present for it
2977000	2979000	Were you there physically? Did you watch the whole...
2979000	2980000	I was there physically
2980000	2981000	You saw the whole flim play?
2981000	2982000	The whole thing
2982000	2987000	I was even in the hazmat suit that you have to wear during the process
2987000	2988000	You were right there
2988000	2990000	You were there with the boots
2990000	2996000	When you were there watching the baby come out, did it change your sex life afterwards?
2996000	2997000	No, it didn't change much
2997000	3000000	We didn't have much of a sex life before then
3000000	3002000	It didn't change that much
3002000	3003000	You had some
3003000	3004000	We had some
3004000	3006000	It got better?
3006000	3008000	I think it did
3008000	3010000	Because you were like, come on, anything goes down there
3010000	3012000	No, yeah
3012000	3014000	Hot dog in the hallway
3015000	3016000	There was a...
3016000	3017000	There was...
3017000	3019000	The doctor was doing the process
3019000	3023000	And it was one of those moments that as a father
3023000	3024000	And you're going through this
3024000	3026000	Many of you will go through this
3026000	3028000	Many of you will go through this
3028000	3029000	All of you will go through this
3029000	3030000	More of you than should
3030000	3031000	No, not all of you
3031000	3032000	Eight billion of us
3032000	3033000	We're all dying
3033000	3035000	Every one of you all go through it
3035000	3038000	For God's sakes, will you adopt a China person?
3038000	3040000	Many people may
3040000	3043000	We'll marry a Chinese girl and go through
3043000	3044000	We went through
3044000	3048000	And what I remember most vividly from this moment
3048000	3051000	Was the moment where I was standing there watching
3051000	3054000	And the doctor's there ready, you know, to receive
3054000	3059000	And suddenly this thing started to appear
3059000	3064000	And I said, oh honey, I see her
3064000	3065000	She's coming
3065000	3069000	And the doctor said, that's a hemorrhoid
3069000	3072000	And we had like another, you know, nine hours
3072000	3075000	Of labor to go
3075000	3077000	And the hemorrhoid came out, it was coming
3077000	3080000	The hemorrhoid was like, oh come on
3080000	3083000	You're like the worst ethnic man ever
3083000	3085000	That changes you
3085000	3087000	Because you think
3087000	3088000	The hemorrhoid was so
3088000	3089000	Wrong direction
3089000	3090000	Well, you know what I mean?
3090000	3091000	For a moment
3091000	3092000	Choke guy
3092000	3094000	No, I mean
3094000	3097000	So are there vaginal hemorrhoids?
3103000	3105000	This segment brought to you by Doritos
3108000	3112000	When what's inside comes to the outside
3112000	3114000	You've got questions
3114000	3117000	Doritos here to snap into them
3117000	3118000	Crispy crispy
3118000	3121000	Anatomical questions
3121000	3122000	All right, thank you
3122000	3124000	But there was a hemorrhoid
3124000	3126000	I mean, hemorrhoids are in your butt
3126000	3128000	Well, I mean, I was actually looking for something
3128000	3129000	That wasn't there yet
3129000	3131000	And I saw what I thought it was
3131000	3132000	It was like an illusion
3132000	3133000	It was an illusion, it was me
3133000	3135000	You were projecting
3135000	3136000	I was projecting
3136000	3138000	But it did change me though
3138000	3139000	I mean
3140000	3142000	Your story just changed me
3142000	3145000	So you have one 19-year-old daughter
3145000	3147000	I have one wonderful 19-year-old
3147000	3150000	What has that been like from year one to year 19?
3150000	3151000	Take us through it
3151000	3153000	From what?
3153000	3155000	I mean, you only have one
3155000	3156000	The fast version
3156000	3157000	That's kind of unusual
3157000	3158000	Yeah, I guess so
3158000	3159000	Yeah, it was great
3159000	3161000	Everything has been...
3161000	3163000	She is so astonishing
3163000	3164000	And she lives in London
3164000	3167000	And she's studying psycholinguistics
3167000	3169000	Jesus lives in London
3169000	3172000	And yeah, she lives in London
3172000	3174000	I'm so glad I met you
3177000	3180000	Thought I had a chance
3180000	3183000	But she lives in London
3183000	3184000	She'll be back though
3184000	3185000	Oh
3186000	3189000	I love Curtis Armstrong meeting all of our friends
3189000	3191000	I guess that's great
3192000	3195000	And she's not involved
3195000	3196000	Oh, nice
3196000	3197000	You are kind of though, right?
3197000	3198000	Politics?
3200000	3202000	No, don't turn him on to your daughter
3202000	3203000	No, I wouldn't really
3204000	3206000	I wouldn't either, god damn it
3206000	3207000	Who am I?
3207000	3208000	No, if you were in my shoes
3208000	3213000	You wouldn't introduce you to my daughter either
3213000	3214000	Right
3214000	3216000	So anyway, there she is
3216000	3217000	And she's doing...
3217000	3218000	She's working
3218000	3219000	And she's...
3219000	3220000	Is your wife British?
3220000	3221000	No, no, no
3221000	3223000	She was over there doing
3223000	3226000	You know a magazine called Mojo magazine?
3226000	3227000	Music magazine
3227000	3228000	You know that?
3228000	3231000	So she was doing an internship there last summer
3231000	3233000	And she was going to go to NYU
3233000	3235000	She wound up hearing that
3235000	3237000	King's College had a great program
3237000	3239000	So she applied and they took her
3239000	3242000	Psycholinguistics, that's not so groovy
3242000	3243000	Did I say psycho?
3243000	3245000	I think you said psycho maybe
3245000	3247000	I think it's just the company
3253000	3256000	Nineteen-year-old daughter
3258000	3260000	Psycholinguistics
3260000	3261000	I know
3261000	3263000	High apatia, Armstrong
3263000	3264000	I would never do that
3264000	3265000	High apatia?
3265000	3266000	Would you really?
3266000	3267000	I would never make a joke like that
3267000	3269000	You just did make a joke
3269000	3271000	I would never in my life
3271000	3273000	You made a joke exactly like that
3273000	3275000	But you're deceived
3275000	3279000	Because I would never make a joke like that
3279000	3282000	My mistake, I stand corrected
3282000	3283000	You know what, it's okay
3283000	3285000	We're going to get through this
3285000	3287000	Anyone?
3287000	3289000	It's 9-11
3289000	3291000	9-11
3291000	3294000	We have some socio-linguistic people here
3294000	3297000	I misspoke, I meant socio-linguistics
3297000	3299000	Which is a whole other branch
3300000	3302000	She's socio-linguistics, you misspoke with psycholinguistics
3302000	3304000	Yes, I was thinking of something else
3304000	3305000	Sociolinguistics means what?
3305000	3306000	I don't know what that means
3306000	3307000	It already sounds
3307000	3309000	I know what socio-linguistics
3309000	3312000	It sounds like a form of verbal anthropology
3312000	3314000	It is kind of that
3314000	3316000	It's the structure of language
3316000	3319000	I could be more fascinated with that
3319000	3322000	My friendship with Jeff is kind of based on Noam Chomsky
3322000	3325000	Because he was a political dissident and a linguist
3325000	3327000	Like when I met Jeff
3327000	3331000	It was the 90s and we were both a couple of young
3331000	3333000	Full of piss and vinegar
3333000	3335000	But I only knew Noam Chomsky because of his linguistic work
3335000	3339000	Jeff had read all this crazy political shit that he had written
3339000	3342000	I didn't even know about his political outspokenness
3342000	3346000	But the language, I'm a verbal thinker
3346000	3348000	I'm very fascinated with language
3348000	3352000	It's something that she got from high school
3352000	3353000	She became interested in it
3353000	3355000	And her senior year in high school
3355000	3357000	Half of her day was spent in high school
3357000	3361000	Half of it was at LACC studying socio-linguistics
3361000	3363000	LACC? So what college?
3363000	3365000	That's L.A. Communi-
3365000	3367000	What? In Hollywood
3367000	3368000	Was she in a dorm?
3368000	3369000	No, no, no, no
3369000	3370000	Nobody's in a dorm
3370000	3371000	They don't have dorms
3371000	3374000	I saw that movie with Seth Rogen
3374000	3376000	You know the whole movie
3376000	3377000	Oh, well
3377000	3378000	The crazy dorm movie
3378000	3380000	Anyone? No, am I the only one?
3380000	3382000	I think you're the only human being in the world
3382000	3385000	That's ever seen
3385000	3386000	I'm sorry
3386000	3388000	Some things that fascinated me about linguistics
3388000	3389000	In no necessary order
3389000	3391000	I'm just going to shotgun them all
3391000	3392000	Breathe deeply
3392000	3394000	And you'll come out of this in no time
3394000	3396000	Help me, help
3396000	3398000	Number one is that when people have kids
3398000	3400000	They always tell you at two years old
3400000	3403000	Like, the kid just starts fucking talking
3403000	3405000	Like, it's just like
3405000	3408000	And we all have this instinctive baby talk thing that we do
3408000	3410000	Which is another thing that's fascinating
3410000	3412000	You know, people write different books
3412000	3414000	And go, don't baby talk, do baby talk
3414000	3415000	It's fucking instinctive
3415000	3416000	Like, you look
3416000	3417000	You do it to dogs
3417000	3419000	When you look at something cute
3419000	3420000	You kind of like
3420000	3422000	You, you, who is the beautiful dog?
3422000	3423000	And what you're doing is
3423000	3424000	I think you're making
3424000	3425000	You're showing it
3425000	3426000	You're trying
3426000	3428000	Except I never did that with her
3428000	3429000	I never did that with her
3429000	3430000	Well, now she's in London
3430000	3431000	Well, no
3431000	3433000	I mean, now I definitely wouldn't do it with her
3433000	3434000	But I didn't
3434000	3435000	I didn't do it with her when she was-
3435000	3436000	Get her on the phone
3436000	3438000	Let's have him do it to her tonight
3438000	3439000	On the show
3439000	3440000	The first time ever
3440000	3441000	You raised your daughter so coldly
3441000	3442000	I'm sorry
3442000	3443000	She had to move to England just to fit in
3443000	3444000	That's right
3444000	3445000	Exactly
3446000	3447000	That's exactly right
3447000	3448000	You have to baby talk him
3449000	3450000	I didn't
3450000	3451000	I made that mistake
3451000	3453000	But it actually turned out okay
3453000	3454000	Yeah
3454000	3455000	Because then suddenly
3455000	3456000	She didn't talk for a long time
3456000	3457000	And then suddenly
3457000	3458000	She just started talking like
3458000	3459000	They just, they just
3459000	3460000	One day they just
3460000	3462000	Every parent I've ever talked to says like
3462000	3463000	Look, you do what you do
3463000	3464000	You hope your kid will talk
3464000	3465000	You hope your
3465000	3466000	You
3466000	3467000	That's exactly right
3467000	3468000	And then one day you come home
3468000	3469000	And you, and the
3469000	3471000	And you just hear a voice from the corner of the room go like
3471000	3472000	You want fries with that?
3472000	3473000	Yeah, exactly
3473000	3476000	What the fucking shit in the hell?
3476000	3477000	That's exactly right
3477000	3478000	My niece like lives
3478000	3481000	My brother and his wife live nearby
3481000	3482000	They live in Eagle Rock
3482000	3483000	Or the time it was Glendale
3483000	3485000	And my niece didn't talk
3485000	3486000	And then one day
3486000	3489000	I didn't go to their house for a couple months
3489000	3490000	Went to the house
3490000	3491000	And my niece is like
3491000	3492000	In a towel
3492000	3493000	She's got out of the bath
3493000	3494000	And she goes
3494000	3495000	She was going
3495000	3496000	Shake, shake, shake
3496000	3497000	Shake, shake, shake
3497000	3498000	Little booty
3498000	3499000	What the fuck?
3499000	3500000	Like last time I saw you
3500000	3501000	You didn't say things
3501000	3502000	And now you're singing
3502000	3503000	The way that they inflect
3503000	3504000	When they're doing their
3504000	3505000	At a young age
3505000	3507000	When they start doing their impressions
3507000	3510000	Of how they see adult communication
3510000	3511000	So you punch them in the face
3511000	3512000	This six year old girl
3512000	3514000	Who like leans up in the doorway
3514000	3515000	And goes
3515000	3516000	Why don't you come up and see me sometimes
3516000	3517000	Right
3517000	3519000	They do weird shit
3519000	3520000	And you have these like anecdotes
3520000	3521000	Of like
3521000	3522000	Oh god
3522000	3523000	When you were a kid
3523000	3524000	You did this thing at the party
3524000	3525000	It was so funny
3526000	3527000	And it was
3527000	3528000	But it's because they like
3528000	3530000	They're more capable of doing like
3530000	3533000	Clearer impressions of adult communication
3533000	3534000	Than we are as adults
3534000	3537000	Because we actually learn the meaning of life
3537000	3540000	And they're actually just full bore like
3540000	3541000	Trying
3541000	3543000	They're doing the equivalent of a parrot
3543000	3544000	But beyond a parrot
3544000	3545000	Because they're not just making noise
3545000	3546000	They're
3546000	3547000	They're smarter than parrots
3547000	3548000	They're communicating
3548000	3549000	They're intuiting
3549000	3550000	And also like
3550000	3552000	They're actually communicating more effectively
3552000	3554000	And you just get these chills down your spine
3554000	3555000	It's like these kids
3555000	3556000	Like they roll their eyes at you
3556000	3558000	And they make it very clear
3558000	3559000	They're over you
3559000	3560000	And like
3560000	3561000	They say
3561000	3564000	They intone things just perfectly
3564000	3565000	And you're like
3565000	3566000	Wait what the fuck are you
3566000	3567000	Why are you
3567000	3571000	You need to be 32 before you have those feelings about crayons
3571000	3572000	Yeah
3572000	3574000	What do you mean that you've had it
3574000	3576000	You've had it up to here with these crayons
3576000	3579000	You said it like
3579000	3580000	Willy Loman
3580000	3583000	That is so true
3584000	3586000	Let me tell you guys
3586000	3589000	The amazing thing to me is that verbal communication
3589000	3591000	For us is biological
3591000	3592000	Verbal communication
3592000	3594000	We've all seen Nell with Jodie Foster
3594000	3597000	Verbal communication would happen in a vacuum
3597000	3598000	That would
3598000	3600000	If you were raised by wolves as a human being
3600000	3603000	You would teach language to the wolves
3603000	3605000	You would start to adopt the wolf language
3605000	3606000	People speak
3606000	3607000	That's what we do
3607000	3609000	We speak verbally
3609000	3611000	But what we don't do naturally
3611000	3612000	Is written language
3613000	3616000	Which is what our entire society is based on
3616000	3621000	Is the secondary, unnatural, mimetic evolution
3621000	3624000	Of language as transcribable thing
3624000	3625000	We think
3625000	3626000	Because when we're kids
3626000	3629000	We're learning to speak and write at the same time
3629000	3632000	And we're learning to read
3632000	3635000	Which means interacting with written language
3635000	3637000	And making it come out of our mouths
3637000	3640000	We grow up feeling like
3640000	3643000	Verbal language is somehow secondary
3643000	3644000	To like
3644000	3646000	That written language is like this really important thing
3646000	3648000	It's sort of like this dumb thing
3648000	3650000	That would go away in one nuclear blast
3650000	3653000	But verbal language is like here to stay
3653000	3656000	So much so that if you walk 30 yards that way
3656000	3658000	People are going gooba gooba gooba gooba gooba
3658000	3660000	And you can't understand what the hell they're saying
3660000	3662000	Because humans like
3662000	3665000	Actually just naturally
3665000	3666000	Hold our breath
3666000	3668000	And use our forebrain and flex it
3668000	3670000	And go
3670000	3671000	Express shit
3671000	3673000	And we use it to geolocate
3673000	3675000	And we use it to socially interact
3675000	3677000	You lost me man
3679000	3681000	I was hanging on for a while
3681000	3683000	I just think it's very
3683000	3685000	I'm going to go to London
3685000	3687000	And I'm going to enroll in your daughter's class
3687000	3689000	I'm telling you that you're the first person I've met
3689000	3691000	Who actually sounds like my daughter
3691000	3694000	I mean that's like talking to my daughter
3694000	3695000	What you were just doing
3695000	3697000	I wish I had time to understand this
3697000	3699000	Can you introduce him to your daughter?
3699000	3701000	I would love to sit in the room and just watch them
3701000	3702000	I would love that
3702000	3704000	But you should bring her by
3704000	3706000	I'll tell you
3706000	3707000	You're very lucky
3707000	3709000	Because I've been here what four times is my fourth time
3709000	3711000	I've never mentioned my daughter
3711000	3713000	Because if I do I'll go on
3713000	3715000	Well it's because I'm a bad person
3715000	3717000	I don't think I've even asked you if you were married
3717000	3719000	For the first three years
3719000	3720000	Until now actually
3720000	3722000	But also
3722000	3724000	I grew up in the 80s
3724000	3725000	When it's like
3725000	3727000	I don't know what if you were married to a goat
3727000	3729000	What if it was your own business
3729000	3730000	I don't know
3730000	3731000	It'd be really great
3731000	3733000	If he was married to a goat
3733000	3735000	I would love that
3735000	3737000	I would respect it and understand it
3737000	3739000	What would be so good about it?
3739000	3741000	I mean it would be awesome
3741000	3743000	I'd be like wow tell me about that
3743000	3745000	And also I'm totally cool with it
3745000	3747000	Because I'm a libertarian
3747000	3749000	And like everybody is
3749000	3751000	They love people that fuck goats
3751000	3753000	They love to let it all hang out
3753000	3755000	If you're happy you know fuck a goat
3755000	3757000	Can I charge you to fuck a goat?
3757000	3759000	And I wouldn't have judged you for it
3759000	3761000	I would have been like that's cool
3761000	3763000	Like tell me about it
3763000	3764000	That's interesting
3764000	3767000	But why weren't you as interested when he was just married to a human woman?
3767000	3769000	Because who isn't?
3769000	3772000	You go to fucking Subway
3772000	3774000	You go to fucking Starbucks
3774000	3776000	There's a bunch of married people
3776000	3778000	And all the public places in between
3778000	3779000	Yeah, yeah, yeah
3779000	3780000	Ralphs
3780000	3781000	Bonds
3781000	3783000	From Starbucks to Subway
3783000	3785000	I'm Justin Reiland
3785000	3787000	Taking you on a tour of America
3789000	3791000	PBC2
3792000	3795000	From paper cups with one logo on them
3795000	3797000	To paper cups with another logo
3798000	3800000	These are the four mica tables
3800000	3802000	From restaurant to restaurant
3802000	3804000	Of our great world
3804000	3807000	Here we found a person that's fucking
3807000	3808000	A emu
3808000	3809000	Or what was it?
3809000	3810000	Goat
3810000	3812000	A goat
3812000	3813000	A goat
3813000	3815000	He also happened to star in
3815000	3817000	A bunch of famous movies
3819000	3820000	Curtis?
3820000	3821000	Yeah, he was in some stuff
3821000	3822000	Okay
3822000	3824000	I know, I just didn't know if that was like something that
3824000	3825000	He's sensitive about
3825000	3827000	That I was talking about?
3829000	3832000	Listen, I'm so scared of everything
3832000	3833000	I'm scared of it
3833000	3835000	I'm scared of offending everyone
3835000	3836000	You know what?
3836000	3837000	Terrified
3837000	3839000	I've done everything I can to make you feel
3839000	3840000	comfortable with me
3841000	3842000	There's nothing else
3842000	3843000	I've been petting you
3843000	3845000	You have, you have, you have
3845000	3847000	Curtis, are you in therapy?
3847000	3848000	No, not anymore
3848000	3849000	Have you ever taken it?
3849000	3850000	Oh yeah
3850000	3851000	Oh god
3851000	3853000	Did it help you learn how to interact with people?
3853000	3856000	I noticed on this show you're very very gracious
3856000	3857000	Maybe you were born that way but
3857000	3858000	No, I was born that way
3858000	3860000	It didn't really help me
3860000	3862000	Learn to communicate with people
3862000	3865000	It just allowed me to express myself
3866000	3868000	In a way that
3868000	3869000	Do you want some vodka?
3869000	3870000	I would like some, thank you
3870000	3871000	Since you're up
3871000	3874000	You seem very able to diffuse even the most fundamentally
3874000	3876000	You're a very, you're a sensitive person
3876000	3878000	You have a good antenna
3878000	3880000	You're very aware of other people's state
3880000	3882000	You sense the other very well
3882000	3884000	Well thank you, thank you
3884000	3885000	I try, I try
3885000	3886000	But that's probably
3886000	3887000	Thank you so much
3887000	3888000	That's perfect
3888000	3890000	When you were a young boy
3890000	3891000	Or a younger man
3892000	3894000	Did that sensitivity get you in trouble?
3894000	3895000	Was it hard on you?
3895000	3896000	To be sensitive?
3896000	3897000	Yeah
3897000	3898000	Absolutely
3898000	3899000	Because it was, you know
3899000	3901000	Obviously being sensitive is a sign of weakness
3901000	3903000	The drama of the gifted child
3903000	3905000	Yeah, I wasn't a gifted child
3905000	3906000	Sure you were
3906000	3907000	Of course you were
3907000	3908000	But I wasn't gifted
3908000	3909000	Of course you were a gifted child
3909000	3910000	Well, don't be a fucking idiot
3910000	3911000	Okay
3911000	3912000	Of course you were a gifted child
3912000	3913000	You're right, I'm sorry
3913000	3914000	You may not
3914000	3916000	You didn't know it
3916000	3917000	Of course you're gifted
3917000	3918000	You're an exceptional person
3918000	3920000	You grew into a person who
3920000	3921000	Oh, easy on him
3921000	3922000	Who's easy
3922000	3926000	Who's possessive of an ability that not everybody has
3926000	3928000	He's like everyone in Hollywood
3928000	3930000	He had talent
3930000	3932000	He was in the right place at the right time
3932000	3938000	And, you know, he had what the fucking movie people needed him to have
3938000	3940000	There was a book I read in the 90s
3940000	3941000	Which is probably no longer
3941000	3943000	That's as good a description as any I've ever heard
3943000	3944000	Not very eloquent
3944000	3946000	When he was taking time out of that rampant goat fucking
3946000	3947000	He was
3948000	3950000	When I could do that
3950000	3953000	Probably everybody in this audience would qualify as gifted
3953000	3954000	At a certain level
3954000	3957000	Like what we learned in the 2000s
3957000	3959000	Is that everybody's gifted in some way or another
3959000	3961000	But in the 90s I read this book
3961000	3963000	That was written by a therapist
3963000	3966000	Who had realized that all therapists were fucked up
3966000	3969000	And that there needed to be a book telling therapists
3969000	3970000	Like look, you're fucked up
3970000	3971000	That's why you're a therapist
3971000	3975000	Like tone with that shit before you go to help people
3975000	3977000	It was called the drama of the gifted child
3977000	3978000	And it was about
3978000	3982000	But gifted, you could swap out like intuitive
3982000	3983000	Like sure
3983000	3984000	Empathic
3984000	3988000	Like being a kid and before you have the word power to express it
3988000	3990000	Understanding that mom's mad about this
3990000	3992000	Dad's jealous of that
3992000	3994000	And this person feels left out
3994000	3995000	And this party is a wreck
3995000	3997000	And like you're six years old
3997000	4000000	And you get these thoughts raising around in your head
4000000	4001000	Because you're gifted
4001000	4003000	You're picking up on things
4003000	4006000	And then you're going to grow up to be a journalist
4006000	4007000	A therapist
4007000	4008000	An actor
4008000	4009000	A director
4009000	4010000	A painter
4010000	4011000	I just have to tell you one thing
4011000	4015000	What's amazing was before I decided I wanted to be an actor
4015000	4017000	I only wanted to be one other thing
4017000	4019000	And that was a journalist
4019000	4020000	When I was like nine
4020000	4022000	I decided I wanted to be a journalist
4022000	4025000	And I was going to be a journalist until I became an actor
4025000	4027000	Is it because you saw the people on TV that were journalists?
4027000	4028000	Yeah, I think so
4028000	4029000	Me too
4029000	4030000	Me too
4030000	4031000	It was like My Girl Friday and movies like that
4031000	4032000	I was like
4032000	4033000	So you were watching Jack Klugman on The Odd Couple
4033000	4034000	And I was like
4034000	4035000	Oh, I want to do that
4035000	4036000	Oh, I want to get paid to shower
4036000	4037000	And like
4037000	4038000	Yeah, absolutely
4038000	4039000	And like Lou Grant
4039000	4042000	And like the archetype of like the guy who was like the five o'clock shadow
4042000	4043000	Yeah, that was me
4043000	4044000	And like no shower
4044000	4045000	And like he's typing, typing, typing
4045000	4048000	And then like some fucking senator is going to pay
4048000	4049000	Yeah
4049000	4050000	Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap
4050000	4051000	Can I ask Chris?
4051000	4052000	I'm going to make him pay with my fingers
4052000	4054000	The best was The Night Stalker
4054000	4055000	Yeah
4055000	4056000	By then I was already an actor
4056000	4057000	But I said
4057000	4058000	But The Night Stalker was perfect
4058000	4060000	Because not only was he cool
4060000	4062000	And wore a seersucker suit
4062000	4064000	And a pork pie hat
4064000	4065000	And smoked cigars
4065000	4066000	And was a journalist
4066000	4068000	But he dealt with vampires
4068000	4069000	And werewolves
4069000	4070000	And shit like that
4070000	4072000	Was The Night Stalker your first movie?
4072000	4073000	Was The Night Stalker your first movie?
4073000	4074000	No, no, no, no, no
4074000	4075000	I'm an actor
4075000	4076000	Wait, wait, wait
4076000	4077000	I'm sorry, listen
4077000	4078000	I just want to know
4078000	4079000	How old were you when you
4079000	4080000	You know, you said you wanted
4080000	4081000	When I decided to be an actor
4081000	4082000	Yes
4082000	4083000	It was like
4083000	4084000	And what was your first
4084000	4085000	I was in
4085000	4086000	Give me a year and what was your first movie

4087000	4088000	Um
4088000	4089000	Give me a year and what was your first movie
4089000	4090000	I'm not preparing
4090000	4091000	I keep forgetting
4091000	4093000	I get sprung these questions without preparation
4093000	4094000	Justin, do you not know?
4094000	4095000	We're wasting everyone's time
4095000	4096000	I know
4096000	4097000	There it is
4097000	4098000	They're all staring at me
4098000	4099000	Waiting for a date
4099000	4100000	Um
4100000	4101000	So my
4101000	4102000	I decided
4102000	4103000	Uh
4103000	4104000	1969
4104000	4105000	1969

4106000	4107000	Really?
4107000	4108000	Yeah
4108000	4109000	He was
4109000	4110000	He was Barbarella
4110000	4111000	Yeah
4111000	4112000	1969
4112000	4113000	Are you serious?
4113000	4114000	No
4114000	4115000	Chris
4115000	4116000	He used to be Jane Fonda
4116000	4117000	When he first started
4117000	4118000	I know
4118000	4119000	Okay, well
4119000	4120000	Okay, so you know
4120000	4121000	No, I'm just saying like
4121000	4122000	He wanted to be a journalist
4122000	4123000	And then he was like
4123000	4124000	You know
4124000	4125000	I wanted to be a journalist
4125000	4126000	When I was 8
4126000	4128000	So when you were trying to make Curtis crazy
4128000	4129000	I think he was trying to
4129000	4130000	Undo early therapy
4130000	4131000	Nice
4131000	4132000	I want to know about Curtis
4132000	4134000	What year was he 8 years old?
4134000	4135000	Okay, 8 years old
4135000	4136000	You were
4136000	4137000	I'm bad at math
4137000	4138000	But I was born in 1953
4138000	4140000	It was the year 1953
4140000	4141000	Curtis
4141000	4142000	That was 1
4142000	4143000	Was 8 years
4143000	4144000	Oh, you were 1
4144000	4145000	I was 1 in 1953
4145000	4147000	The year was 1953
4147000	4148000	8 years later
4148000	4151000	Curtis was 1 years old
4151000	4152000	Curtis
4152000	4153000	He had
4153000	4154000	Admirations and dreams
4154000	4155000	The boys
4155000	4156000	He wanted to be a journalist
4156000	4159000	But maybe if things didn't work out
4159000	4160000	He'd do a movie
4160000	4161000	Maybe
4161000	4162000	We don't know
4162000	4163000	He wants to be a journalist
4163000	4164000	Curtis
4164000	4167000	Justin needed the amount of information to do this
4167000	4168000	What year?

4173000	4175000	Curtis wanted to be an actor
4175000	4177000	You could have done that with any information
4177000	4180000	I want a little more information please
4180000	4181000	Curtis

4237000	4238000	I've been here before
4238000	4239000	I can't believe this is only your fourth show
4239000	4242000	Because you feel like a seasoned friend of the family here

4263000	4264000	Right
4264000	4265000	Which is fucking amazing

4279000	4280000	I'm sorry, I'm gonna stop
4280000	4281000	We did it
4281000	4282000	Listen to four episodes ago

4316000	4318000	Or he appears to feel comfortable
4318000	4319000	I ate somebody's weed chocolate
4319000	4320000	And it's starting to hit me
4320000	4321000	Yeah

4329000	4330000	You didn't eat the whole thing
4330000	4331000	No, I ate like a quarter of it
4331000	4332000	But that's a lot of candy
4332000	4333000	I bet it has a candy
4333000	4334000	Yeah, I think you're supposed to do that
4334000	4335000	And it's hitting me right now
4335000	4337000	But I'm hanging in there

4537000	4538000	The next day
4538000	4540000	My dad's driving us to pick up my aunt
4540000	4542000	And we're like
4542000	4544000	What movie are we gonna go see?
4544000	4545000	And she's like
4545000	4546000	I wanna go see
4546000	4548000	Revenge of the Nerds 2
4548000	4549000	And I'm like
4549000	4550000	This fucking bitch like
4551000	4554000	Had her way with me last night
4554000	4556000	And that's really fucked up
4556000	4557000	And crazy, right?
4557000	4558000	Yeah
4558000	4560000	She should wanna go see
4560000	4561000	Well, but
4561000	4562000	Network
4562000	4563000	So my response
4564000	4565000	That's
4565000	4567000	That's a lot older than
4567000	4568000	That came out many years earlier
4568000	4569000	I know, but I'm just wondering
4569000	4570000	What's the
4570000	4572000	So what I said
4572000	4573000	Obviously
4573000	4574000	Was
4574000	4575000	Yeah, let's go see fucking
4575000	4577000	Revenge of the Nerds 2
4577000	4578000	I just got raped
4578000	4580000	But I didn't say that
4580000	4581000	I didn't say that
4581000	4583000	But I did think to myself
4583000	4584000	When we're watching
4584000	4585000	And my dad was like
4585000	4586000	No, we're not gonna watch
4586000	4587000	Revenge of the Nerds 2
4587000	4588000	That's bullshit
4588000	4589000	You've been raped
4589000	4590000	No, he didn't know
4590000	4591000	Okay, he didn't know
4591000	4592000	Yeah, he didn't know
4592000	4593000	But I was like
4593000	4595000	Wow, man, this is gonna be awesome
4596000	4597000	By the way, seriously
4597000	4598000	Wait, can I just say
4598000	4600000	You realize your story
4600000	4602000	Is the definition of front-loaded
4604000	4606000	It's all true up until
4606000	4609000	Unless there's a treasure ship involved
4609000	4610000	It's all true
4610000	4611000	Everything I said was true
4611000	4613000	Up until the very end of it
4613000	4614000	And then I started to
4614000	4615000	You know
4615000	4616000	Your story begins
4616000	4618000	With your cousin raping you
4618000	4620000	And goes into
4620000	4621000	Like a diary entry
4621000	4623000	About seeing a movie
4623000	4624000	And popcorn was like
4624000	4625000	Five dollars
4625000	4626000	It was all true
4626000	4627000	It was all true
4628000	4630000	It was all true up until the very end
4630000	4631000	Of course it's true
4631000	4632000	It's boring
4633000	4634000	What do you mean?
4634000	4635000	Come on, man
4635000	4637000	Go back to the first part
4637000	4638000	No, no, no, I'm saying
4638000	4639000	That's what's all true
4639000	4640000	Right
4640000	4642000	All the best part is true
4642000	4643000	Right
4643000	4644000	And then when it got boring
4644000	4645000	Was when I was like
4645000	4647000	I need a punchline to this story
4647000	4649000	Wow, I'm really putting myself out there
4649000	4650000	Why did
4650000	4651000	Harmon
4651000	4652000	I'm like
4652000	4653000	Oh, geez, my
4653000	4654000	What movie did you see?
4654000	4655000	My mom's
4655000	4657000	niece raped me when I was
4657000	4658000	Six
4658000	4659000	What movie did you see?
4659000	4660000	I need a punchline
4661000	4662000	But you don't need a punchline
4662000	4663000	You can just tell us
4663000	4664000	Then we went to go see
4664000	4665000	Revenge of the Nerds 2
4665000	4666000	So that's why it ties into
4666000	4667000	Curtis here
4668000	4669000	Wow
4669000	4670000	And by the way
4670000	4671000	It was so great
4671000	4672000	I love that movie
4672000	4673000	Part 2 was so good
4673000	4674000	Thanks, man
4674000	4675000	I remember sitting there
4675000	4676000	With my
4676000	4677000	With your niece
4677000	4678000	With my cousin
4678000	4679000	I mean, your cousin
4679000	4680000	Sitting next to me
4680000	4681000	And she kept touching my leg
4681000	4682000	And I was like
4682000	4683000	I'm trying to laugh at the
4683000	4684000	Amazing Curtis joke
4684000	4685000	So she was still
4685000	4686000	She's 14
4686000	4687000	You're a seven
4687000	4688000	Okay, so I'm
4688000	4690000	She's lacquering
4690000	4691000	I'm putting a
4691000	4693000	Paint of lacquer
4693000	4694000	Over the truth
4694000	4696000	The real thing that happened to me
4696000	4697000	Which I'm revealing
4697000	4698000	On Dan Harmon's
4698000	4699000	Harmontown podcast
4699000	4700000	Is that
4700000	4701000	My
4701000	4702000	Brought to you by Doritos
4702000	4703000	Flavored corn chips
4703000	4704000	That's me
4704000	4705000	Ladies and gentlemen
4705000	4706000	Can I get a round of applause
4706000	4707000	Please
4707000	4709000	But she was hot
4709000	4710000	Is that
4710000	4711000	Catas molestation
4711000	4712000	She was really hot
4712000	4713000	She was really hot
4713000	4714000	I think that's why I have
4714000	4715000	All these problems
4715000	4716000	Right now
4716000	4717000	She was really hot
4717000	4718000	And I'm not making it up
4718000	4719000	I swear to fucking God
4719000	4720000	Okay
4720000	4724000	So what the fuck now, Curtis?
4724000	4725000	What?
4725000	4726000	How is this
4726000	4727000	How is this his problem?
4727000	4728000	Revenge of what?
4728000	4731000	Revenge of what?
4731000	4732000	Revenge of what?
4732000	4734000	How is this his problem?
4734000	4737000	I am fucking speechless
4737000	4740000	I don't even know where to go from there
4740000	4741000	That's why I love you, man
4741000	4744000	I love you too, man
4744000	4746000	And you actually turned out okay
4746000	4748000	No, no, I'm not really
4748000	4750000	I'm seriously supportive
4750000	4751000	If I wasn't so afraid of death
4751000	4753000	I would already be dead right now
4753000	4754000	I know, I heard that before
4754000	4755000	Put it on the books
4755000	4757000	And I like that people are applauding
4757000	4758000	When you say that
4758000	4760000	Well, because they're willing to call it
4760000	4761000	Yeah
4761000	4762000	Don't be afraid
4762000	4765000	Just hug me as I choked it out
4765000	4768000	Just cuddle me as a fucking
4768000	4771000	If you are out there and you're a young person
4771000	4773000	And you do have thoughts of your own mortality
4773000	4774000	Please talk to somebody
4774000	4776000	I'm saying it again
4776000	4778000	Let's bring out Demours Brown, everybody
4778000	4780000	Hey, by the way, I'm Demours Brown
4780000	4782000	Demours in the States
4782000	4793000	Just to the story brought to you by a Honda Motors
4793000	4796000	Taste the cousin
4806000	4808000	You want some Doritos?
4808000	4810000	Yeah, we're lousy with Doritos up here
4810000	4813000	Hey Harmon, we're doing a subway thing for Rick and Morty
4813000	4814000	Oh yeah?
4814000	4815000	Yeah, yeah
4815000	4816000	Subway's great
4816000	4818000	Subway is the best way to lose weight
4818000	4820000	Stay in shape
4820000	4821000	And be cool
4821000	4822000	Great sandwich company
4822000	4824000	What the fuck is going on under this bandage?
4824000	4825000	What, bro?
4825000	4826000	You okay, Harmon?
4826000	4827000	I want to rip it off
4827000	4829000	But I'm afraid I'll just fly across the room like a balloon
4832000	4834000	Are your narcos wearing off right now?
4834000	4835000	What's happening?
4835000	4836000	Oh yeah, good point
4837000	4838000	The last thing they should
4838000	4839000	needs us more dope
4839000	4841000	What a courage, Jim, Jesus Christ
4841000	4844000	Somebody in my painkillers are in my background
4844000	4846000	Give me a Norco on your way out
4848000	4850000	Now we're just having people deliver painkillers on stage
4850000	4851000	I love that
4851000	4852000	No, I'm kidding
4852000	4853000	They stabbed me in my sleep
4853000	4855000	I don't have a prescription for them
4855000	4857000	I shouldn't have them, so I was just kidding
4857000	4859000	They gave me a small bottle of $6 pills, you know
4859000	4861000	These are for the pain
4861000	4862000	I do wake up in pain
4862000	4863000	I'm a pussy
4863000	4867000	I can't believe that people get their kidneys removed
4867000	4869000	That people have, like, procedures done
4869000	4871000	I don't know what I'll do when I get sick
4871000	4873000	Harmon, is Erin here tonight?
4873000	4874000	Is she back there?
4874000	4875000	Erin, are you with us?
4875000	4877000	No, she's shooting at our place
4877000	4878000	Carol would
4878000	4879000	It's getting late
4879000	4880000	We might want to
4881000	4884000	Should we have, and I say this at our own peril
4884000	4886000	Should we have Justin play Erin's character?
4886000	4887000	Yeah, I think, yeah
4888000	4890000	It's the easy thing to do
4890000	4892000	I knew we usually would bring up a lady
4892000	4893000	I disagree with you there
4893000	4895000	The mores your Curtis are nodding, yes, so
4895000	4896000	Yeah
4897000	4899000	Spencer's folders, please
4899000	4900000	Hold on
4900000	4902000	I know we would usually bring up a lady
4902000	4905000	But I read in Deadline recently that there's too much diversity
4907000	4910000	We're living in the world of diversity overload
4910000	4913000	Was that that, that was the one about Empire?
4913000	4917000	Yes, there was an article in Deadline that said, like
4917000	4920000	The people love black people on the television
4920000	4921000	But is it a bad thing?
4921000	4923000	Is it too much of a good thing?
4924000	4926000	Stop looking at me, man
4926000	4927000	Seriously
4927000	4929000	Not on television, so
4932000	4935000	My favorite thing in the world is always about like, yeah
4935000	4938000	As a fat white old straight man
4938000	4941000	I have always loved in common sections of the culture of like
4941000	4944000	Any degree of like forward movement being met with like
4944000	4946000	The slippery slope argument
4946000	4948000	Like, what's next?
4948000	4950000	I was like, yeah, what's next? Who cares?
4950000	4951000	Who cares?
4953000	4956000	What, what, am I going to turn the TV and see like 11 black people?
4958000	4960000	So I'm playing as Aaron?
4960000	4961000	Yeah, you're playing Aaron
4961000	4963000	Can I totally fuck her game up tonight?
4963000	4964000	Yeah
4964000	4967000	Yeah, I mean if you want to be hack
4967000	4968000	Hey, listen
4968000	4969000	You know what?
4969000	4970000	I don't look at it as hack
4970000	4973000	I look at it as like fucking diabolical
4973000	4975000	I think the most ironic thing you could do
4975000	4976000	I mean, I always fucking like
4976000	4977000	The most ironic thing you could do
4977000	4978000	I want to eat buttholes
4978000	4981000	Is blow people's mind by putting in like an amazing performance
4981000	4984000	As this female character who's like our
4984000	4986000	Dan, what if I want to go to a village
4986000	4989000	And just lick every butthole
4989000	4990000	We've done it
4990000	4991000	That was last episode
4991000	4993000	Cut off her, cut off her legs
4996000	4997000	Okay, I see what you're saying
4997000	4998000	You're saying you gotta get
4998000	4999000	We've done it, we've done it
4999000	5000000	Oh shit
5000000	5001000	We've done the whole
5001000	5002000	You gotta get more creative than that
5002000	5003000	Pretend
5003000	5005000	We've done the thing where people tie a character
5005000	5007000	And then they spend their whole episode
5007000	5009000	Like cutting things off
5009000	5011000	Look, I'm gonna take it seriously
5011000	5012000	I care
5012000	5014000	I want to progress the group forward
5014000	5017000	But if I can pick up a flower that
5017000	5018000	If I put in my butthole
5018000	5021000	Will give me some sort of advantage amongst all of you guys
5021000	5022000	I don't want to play you guys against each other
5022000	5024000	But if you could be more like Curtis
5024000	5027000	Like just watch what Curtis does
5027000	5029000	I love Curtis
5029000	5031000	Curtis is an expert Shadowrun player
5031000	5032000	He's like
5032000	5034000	He is the highlight of the Shadowrun game
5034000	5036000	He dives into his character
5037000	5039000	Dan's not happy with my
5039000	5041000	These absurd concepts
5041000	5043000	Yeah, but he'll be happy once you start
5043000	5044000	Yeah
5044000	5045000	Cause you're gonna be like Curtis
5045000	5046000	Yeah, Justin just pretend
5046000	5048000	Curtis is my mentor
5048000	5050000	You're in a sci-fi, Blade Runner-y kind of universe
5050000	5052000	Where we're getting capers
5052000	5053000	And we're trying to make money
5053000	5054000	Man, I'm there
5054000	5055000	I'm with you guys
5055000	5056000	I'm gonna go out of my way
5056000	5058000	I'm gonna go up, down, left and right
5058000	5061000	A, B, select, start to help you guys out
5061000	5062000	Nice
5062000	5064000	In this crazy video game thing we're about to do
5064000	5065000	Nice
5065000	5066000	We would
5066000	5069000	Spencer, please take us away and recap our last episode
5069000	5071000	It's B, A, select, start
5073000	5075000	Shadow snap
5076000	5078000	I never claimed it wasn't
5078000	5081000	Last time on Harmon Town's Shadowrun
5081000	5084000	We found our gang separated from each other
5084000	5087000	And feeling strangely sexual
5087000	5091000	Jim Nightblade, having removed himself from the goings-on of his party
5091000	5095000	Leared upon a schoolyard from behind the confines of its wrapped metal fence
5095000	5101000	Mercy trying to lure Arturo Spagulli away from his fistfuls of burger tyrant burgers
5101000	5103000	And into the group's Uber
5103000	5108000	Offered to kiss his balls just once if he agreed to go outside with her
5108000	5109000	Doritos
5109000	5110000	Meanwhile
5111000	5117000	Eve Libertine is feeling experimental and unable to resist pulling down Dr. Friend's pants
5117000	5120000	To give him semi-consensual
5120000	5123000	Butterfly kisses on his balls
5124000	5128000	She literally summons butterflies to flicker their wings upon
5128000	5130000	I was pretty drunk
5131000	5133000	Cool ranch
5133000	5138000	Dr. Friend casts upon Spagulli a spell of agony
5138000	5141000	Rithing in pain, his hired muscles dumbfounded
5141000	5145000	Dr. Friend rushed in, offering to take the man to the hospital
5145000	5149000	Will Spagulli released from his burger-y clutches
5149000	5153000	Finally reveal the whereabouts of Lil' Jelly Dervish
5153000	5159000	Or will the end of the recess release Jim Nightblade from his clutches on the linked fence?
5159000	5162000	Find out on Harmon Town's Shadowrun
5162000	5163000	Thank you
5163000	5165000	I just want to...
5165000	5169000	This one was written by...
5169000	5171000	Kit Attic
5171000	5173000	Kit Attic on Twitter
5173000	5176000	I did go from the playground to the roof of the...
5176000	5178000	I was going to the roof of the burger place
5178000	5180000	You went up there and there's some pipes
5180000	5181000	There was nothing and then it came back down
5181000	5183000	And then you started pick-locking the back door
5183000	5186000	Right, so we've got Spagulli in the van now, right?
5186000	5187000	We do
5187000	5188000	Yeah
5188000	5189000	That's where we left off
5189000	5193000	Tell me again, Spencer, what's the connection with Lil' Jelly Dervish? Why do we need him?
5193000	5194000	Well, okay
5194000	5196000	So you're on this job from Ryan Dervish
5196000	5199000	He's trying to get you to find his son Jelly, who the mob kidnapped
5199000	5202000	Now Arturo Spagulli is tied to the mob
5202000	5205000	And you have him, they're all semi-conscious in your truck
5205000	5209000	You know, presumably to talk to him or touch him
5209000	5213000	Let's drive him to a remote location and interrogate this guy, you guys
5213000	5214000	Yes
5214000	5218000	Hodorod would like to use his sort of map soft of Seattle
5218000	5219000	Yeah
5219000	5221000	To take him to a remote location
5221000	5224000	By remote, I mean figuratively
5224000	5225000	Let's take him to Gasworks Park
5225000	5226000	There we go
5226000	5229000	You head to an alley near Gasworks Park
5229000	5233000	It's the low, you know, underserved area of Seattle
5233000	5236000	Actually, you know, a lot of Seattle's pretty underserved in the...
5236000	5237000	Nice
5237000	5238000	Sixth world
5239000	5240000	Seattle snap
5240000	5246000	You pull into a dirty alley next to a dumpster full of garbage, presumably
5246000	5248000	And stop
5249000	5250000	All right
5251000	5253000	Mercy, that's you, Justin
5253000	5257000	You're our negotiator and our face man, woman
5258000	5263000	Ask Arturo Spagulli where Little Jelly Dervish is and get the goods on
5263000	5266000	Who the fuck is Arturo Spagulli and just...
5266000	5267000	I'm in, I'm in
5267000	5269000	This is the guy we just abducted from a burger joint
5269000	5270000	He knows
5270000	5271000	None of us are him
5271000	5272000	He's a gangster
5272000	5273000	Who's doing him?
5273000	5274000	He's a gangster always
5274000	5275000	Me, this guy
5275000	5276000	Spencer
5276000	5277000	Oh, Spencer, our dungeon master
5277000	5278000	Yeah
5278000	5279000	Of course
5279000	5281000	Okay, so we're in trouble
5281000	5282000	Our group's in trouble
5282000	5284000	No, no, no, we're in charge right now
5284000	5287000	We want him to tell us where Little Jelly Dervish is
5287000	5289000	Because he's a gangster and he knows the goods on
5289000	5292000	Hey, my name's Marcy O'Donnell
5295000	5298000	You're looking at me and you think it's a joke
5298000	5301000	But I'm fucking not kidding around right now
5301000	5304000	I want to know where our person is, right?
5304000	5305000	Yeah
5306000	5308000	Where the fuck is our person?
5308000	5311000	I'm not kidding around
5311000	5313000	Roll confidence
5313000	5316000	Roll confidence dice
5316000	5319000	Anyone got any of the confidence dice I could roll?
5319000	5320000	Yeah, you get it
5320000	5323000	If I roll high in confidence, can I at least like
5323000	5324000	Intimidate you?
5324000	5326000	Because I have no confidence right now
5326000	5328000	That's why I want to kill myself, ladies and gentlemen
5328000	5329000	That's what we got into earlier
5329000	5330000	Stay focused, stay focused
5330000	5331000	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
5331000	5333000	Listen, this guy
5333000	5336000	Or this girl, actually
5336000	5337000	Is saying
5337000	5340000	Where the fuck is our friend?
5340000	5341000	Where is he?
5341000	5342000	Or her
5342000	5343000	Where is he?
5343000	5344000	Where are they?
5346000	5347000	What?
5347000	5349000	Who's your person?
5349000	5351000	Little Jelly Dervish
5351000	5352000	Where am I?
5352000	5356000	Is it not possible that I might mind think with Marcy?
5356000	5357000	Oh, you could do that
5357000	5359000	Marcy?
5359000	5360000	Oh, that's you, Justin
5360000	5361000	Marcy
5361000	5362000	Oh, yes, I'm here
5362000	5363000	You are now dealing
5363000	5365000	I'm getting pissed over here
5365000	5366000	Yes
5366000	5368000	Don't speak out loud, use your mind
5368000	5370000	Mm-hmm, use my mind
5370000	5371000	This is one of my powers, right?
5371000	5372000	No
5374000	5376000	I'm trying to read my rules here
5376000	5377000	I think I dropped one
5377000	5378000	You don't have to read it
5378000	5379000	Okay, all right
5379000	5381000	Be cool, be cool, man
5381000	5382000	Just sort of
5382000	5383000	Just relax
5383000	5386000	Just sort of use the assumption that you have power
5386000	5388000	And that you are in charge of this situation
5388000	5389000	All right, listen, Spencer
5389000	5391000	I'm not fucking around
5391000	5393000	Where the fuck is my friend?
5393000	5395000	My name's Marcy O'Donnell
5395000	5397000	I'm sick of this shit
5397000	5399000	I don't know what my super power abilities are
5399000	5402000	But I swear to God, I'm gonna break them out in two seconds
5402000	5403000	Marcy
5404000	5405000	Here we go
5405000	5407000	You're gonna get real upset
5407000	5409000	That's the stuff, that's the stuff
5409000	5410000	Here we go, yeah
5410000	5412000	Listen, man, lady, listen, man
5412000	5413000	Ooh
5413000	5416000	Marcy, you also have the most beautiful face in all the world
5416000	5417000	Thank you
5418000	5419000	I'm trying
5419000	5421000	That was just a thought
5421000	5422000	From who to go
5422000	5423000	It's a good thought
5423000	5425000	Where am I, man?
5425000	5427000	You're in a van in Gasworks Park, Jack
5427000	5429000	We want to know where Little Jelly Dervish is
5429000	5432000	Gasworks Park, shit
5432000	5433000	All right
5433000	5435000	You know what, the important thing is
5435000	5438000	We're all in a world that's so much easier
5438000	5440000	Than it ever had to be
5440000	5442000	It's like, we all have easy jobs
5442000	5444000	And none of us want to do anything for it, you know
5444000	5446000	Like, you got information
5446000	5447000	We need it
5447000	5449000	Our tarot inches towards the door
5449000	5450000	I grab him
5450000	5452000	I microfiber his hand
5452000	5453000	Oh, shit
5453000	5454000	Nano whip
5454000	5455000	You slice it open
5456000	5457000	He's like, oh, God
5457000	5459000	Yeah, no, it's like, you don't
5459000	5460000	Oh, my God
5460000	5462000	I'm trying to explain how the world works to you
5462000	5464000	What do you guys want? You're talking about your person?
5464000	5465000	I don't, what?
5465000	5468000	I'm trying to explain something to you and you're not listening
5468000	5470000	When you reach for the door, you're not listening
5470000	5473000	Is it possible that the doctor
5473000	5477000	Is it possible that the doctor might do some healing at this point?
5479000	5480000	Brought to you by Doritos
5480000	5481000	All right
5482000	5486000	I'm going to heal your hand
5486000	5487000	I woke up
5487000	5488000	Wait, wait, wait, wait
5488000	5489000	God damn it
5489000	5491000	But you have to listen to me
5492000	5494000	They're going to hurt you
5496000	5498000	And there's nothing I can do about it
5498000	5500000	Just not show healing
5500000	5501000	Well, I'm getting to the healing
5501000	5502000	I'm just a mess
5502000	5503000	I'm just getting to the not showing
5503000	5504000	He can heal his hand
5507000	5509000	You just let the man do his thing
5510000	5512000	Heal
5518000	5521000	Now, for God's sake, talk to them
5521000	5523000	Tell them where Spinkly is
5523000	5524000	Spinkly?
5526000	5529000	He says, he says, oh, fuck, thanks, man
5529000	5531000	That's, that's some cool stuff
5532000	5534000	It's crazy, technology, culture
5534000	5537000	It's just like, basically afforded us all the ability to do barely nothing
5537000	5538000	And still get by
5538000	5541000	Like, for instance, like, you could just tell us what we want to know
5541000	5544000	And it's like a whole day's work for you and us
5544000	5548000	You could just, you know, ask close-ended questions
5550000	5553000	I put my fists in the air and I snap out my snap blades
5553000	5556000	I have blades that emerge out of my forearms from my jacket
5556000	5558000	And I say, listen, Jackson, we're not going to hurt you
5558000	5562000	Unless you tell us where little jelly dervish is
5563000	5565000	Hey, when is it my turn after this?
5565000	5567000	I'm not, I'm not trying to be that guy
5567000	5568000	Your turn's next
5569000	5570000	Yeah
5570000	5571000	Sorry, sorry
5571000	5573000	What do you want with that guy?
5573000	5574000	None of your business
5574000	5578000	Oh, you know, yeah, it's like, you got the rolls all mixed up
5579000	5580000	Yeah
5580000	5581000	Do you know where he is?
5582000	5583000	I do
5583000	5585000	Do you want to, do you want to tell us where he is and take us to him
5585000	5587000	Or do you want to get hurt?
5588000	5590000	I don't want to get hurt
5590000	5592000	Just want some burgers, man
5592000	5595000	We'll get you all the, we'll take you, you take us to your little jelly dervish
5595000	5597000	We'll take you right back to the burger tyrant
5597000	5599000	And the first round of burgers is on us
5599000	5603000	Well, that's, that's lucky because he's in the burger tyrant
5604000	5606000	The one that we were just at?
5606000	5607000	Yeah
5607000	5608000	Shit!
5608000	5609000	Yeah
5609000	5611000	Is he, is he work there or is he a customer there?
5611000	5613000	Oh no, neither
5613000	5614000	Where is he?
5614000	5616000	He's been sitting for this entire time
5617000	5619000	Is he hiding inside the building?
5619000	5622000	We have him locked up in the freezer
5623000	5624000	Don't hurt me
5624000	5627000	Alright, let's tie this guy up and get back to the burger tyrant
5627000	5628000	Can I get a burger?
5628000	5631000	We're gonna have to hang on to you, consider yourself a kind of human receipt
5631000	5633000	Get some weapons
5633000	5635000	Oh, just, yep
5635000	5639000	Yeah, we gotta make sure the burger of your information is edible
5641000	5646000	As a distraction, might I suggest that I do a bit of a performance
5646000	5650000	Ordering a burger for him so that he feels that there's some enticement
5651000	5652000	Yeah
5653000	5655000	Where do you order a burger from though?
5655000	5657000	Because you're in Gasworks Park right now
5658000	5659000	I'm using Mindlink
5661000	5663000	Alright, look, can I ask a question?
5663000	5664000	Uh, Arturo?
5664000	5665000	Uh, yeah
5665000	5668000	You want to tell us the things we have to worry about
5668000	5672000	Because the thing is, we're gonna, we're gonna leave you in our care
5673000	5675000	We're gonna go try to get jellyfish
5676000	5680000	To the extent that we have difficulty doing so, you will die
5680000	5682000	So, now you're on our team
5682000	5686000	So you tell us everything we need to know to make it a quick mission
5686000	5688000	And then you're done
5688000	5690000	Like, what do we have to worry about when we go there?
5690000	5693000	Well, they got, they got turrets
5693000	5694000	They got
5694000	5695000	Great
5695000	5696000	They got metal detectors
5696000	5697000	Where are the turrets?
5697000	5698000	Give us all the location of it
5698000	5699000	Where the fuck are the turrets at, dude?
5699000	5701000	They're by the counter, they pop up
5701000	5702000	Oh, seriously
5702000	5706000	Can we get this guy to upload into Hordegard's, like, mental map? Is there a way to link that?
5706000	5708000	I don't have any of that, man
5708000	5709000	I'm not even on the internet
5709000	5713000	Look, I know Dan, and he doesn't want to deal with no motherfucking turrets
5714000	5715000	Neither do I
5715000	5718000	Well, there was turrets and there was, what else, what was the other thing?
5718000	5720000	Turrets and metal detectors
5720000	5722000	Hey, I don't want to speak for you, I'm just saying
5722000	5724000	I think we might be on the same page on this one
5724000	5726000	Well, one thing we know, the burger tyrant doesn't
5726000	5729000	Listen, I've known Dan for a while, I'll tell you one thing you don't like
5729000	5730000	Turrets
5731000	5732000	You're gonna key to the back?
5733000	5734000	Uh, yeah
5734000	5736000	Give it to us
5739000	5742000	What do we have to do to get that fucking key to the back room?
5742000	5744000	Seriously, give it to me
5744000	5745000	Okay
5745000	5746000	Here it is
5746000	5747000	Thank you
5747000	5748000	Okay, go ahead
5748000	5749000	What's the code number?
5749000	5750000	Go ahead
5750000	5751000	Is there a lock?
5751000	5752000	It's a key
5752000	5753000	Shh, let him give out the code number
5753000	5754000	Go ahead
5754000	5755000	What is it, Spencer?
5755000	5757000	There isn't a code number, it's a key
5757000	5759000	Good, what is it?
5759000	5760000	A
5760000	5762000	It's a golden
5762000	5763000	A1
5763000	5764000	It's one of those
5764000	5765000	Spagulli
5765000	5766000	UB40 keys
5766000	5769000	Using my intellect, I suggest that you just put it in your pocket
5769000	5770000	Spagulli, is there
5772000	5775000	Is there a lock on the freezer where jellyfish is?
5775000	5776000	No
5776000	5779000	Alright, I think we got enough
5779000	5782000	Let's go back to the burger tyrant, it's a little back and forth here
5786000	5788000	You arrive at the burger tyrant
5790000	5793000	Who's going to stay with Arturo?
5793000	5795000	What are we going to do with him?
5795000	5798000	Let's just tie him up and leave him here
5798000	5800000	Duck taped up and listen
5800000	5801000	He's talking about me right now?
5801000	5802000	No
5802000	5803000	Or is that my schizophrenia?
5803000	5804000	I'm sorry
5804000	5805000	Is that my schizophrenia?
5805000	5806000	Are you guys talking about tying me up?
5806000	5808000	If you have to ask, is it my schizophrenia?
5808000	5809000	It is
5810000	5812000	No one's ever asked that
5812000	5813000	I better get back on my man
5813000	5815000	It's not, it's your sanity
5817000	5818000	Alright
5818000	5819000	Rest assured
5819000	5821000	My doctor's about to get rich
5821000	5824000	I say that we tie him up and gag him
5824000	5828000	But we keep him in the van with us in case we need him as collateral in some way
5828000	5829000	Alright listen
5829000	5830000	I won't hurt anyone here
5830000	5832000	I know the voices are totally trolling me
5832000	5834000	You're not the one you're talking about
5834000	5835000	They're trolling me
5838000	5839000	Alright
5839000	5840000	Alright
5840000	5841000	So we're back at the burger giant
5841000	5843000	We got Spagulli tied up in the van
5843000	5844000	Can we get a
5844000	5845000	What?
5848000	5849000	Well what are you doing?
5849000	5850000	He was just, he was sharing something
5850000	5852000	It wasn't, it wasn't about the game
5852000	5853000	That's not for you guys
5853000	5854000	It was something else
5854000	5855000	Like that's like
5855000	5857000	I've been really honest and open with this crowd
5857000	5858000	But like
5858000	5859000	I went
5859000	5860000	I went like
5860000	5861000	3 layers above that
5861000	5862000	For Curtis
5862000	5863000	Just now
5863000	5864000	Just now
5864000	5865000	She wasn't that hot
5865000	5866000	No
5866000	5867000	No
5867000	5869000	That's very superficial
5869000	5871000	That's very superficial
5871000	5873000	This had to do with tinfoil hats
5873000	5876000	And like alien people and all that kind of shit
5876000	5879000	Like reptile fucking people on the news
5879000	5880000	You know
5880000	5882000	So what Dan said I said
5882000	5884000	Is really offensive
5884000	5887000	Cause I was talking about reptile eyes
5887000	5889000	Like reptile eyes and you know
5889000	5890000	Alright sorry
5890000	5891000	I'm so sorry
5891000	5892000	Hey guys
5892000	5894000	I have a spell of improved invisibility
5894000	5897000	I can make myself completely invisible to people and to detectors
5897000	5898000	You can give me the key
5898000	5899000	I'll go in there
5899000	5900000	Bing bang boom
5900000	5901000	But then
5901000	5903000	How do we get him out of there without being seen on the way out?
5903000	5904000	Who's saying this?
5904000	5905000	This is me
5905000	5906000	Eve
5906000	5909000	Another rare joke from Cotego
5913000	5914000	By the way I like your
5914000	5915000	Who's saying this?
5915000	5916000	Put a spell on your jokes
5916000	5917000	He's like Borat
5920000	5921000	Yeah we're all together right
5921000	5924000	I'm so we're behind the back door of Burger United
5924000	5925000	And we're like
5925000	5926000	We're trying to form a game plan
5926000	5927000	Yes that's great
5927000	5929000	Your enhanced invisibility
5929000	5930000	Okay but once I get him
5930000	5931000	Once I'm in there
5931000	5933000	And I gotta get him out through the thing
5933000	5936000	Um like how do I get him out without the turrets going off on the hold?
5936000	5938000	I feel like we need to go in the front
5938000	5940000	Uh like
5940000	5943000	Okay so magic people weren't getting stopped at the front right?
5943000	5946000	So actually people with magic abilities should go in the front
5946000	5948000	Take out these motherfuckers
5948000	5951000	People who have hardware should go in the back
5951000	5954000	Because every time someone with guns goes in the front
5954000	5955000	Do I have hardware?
5955000	5956000	Uh yes
5956000	5957000	No
5957000	5958000	Doctor
5959000	5960000	I wanna do the best I can do
5960000	5962000	Doctor and Eve and uh
5962000	5963000	And Hordegarn
5963000	5964000	They should go in the front
5964000	5967000	And like take them out with like spells and telekinesis
5967000	5969000	I'll go in the back with uh
5969000	5971000	With uh mercy
5971000	5975000	But I also have maximum capabilities with
5975000	5977000	I didn't mean to offend you
5977000	5979000	I'm just saying like
5979000	5982000	Listen it's gonna require more than one of us to do this
5982000	5985000	Anyone that has the ability to like hurt someone with their mind
5985000	5987000	I'll walk in and uh
5987000	5989000	I'll go in there and just stun bolt
5989000	5991000	Or stun ball the entire room and just knock everybody out
5991000	5993000	And I'll come in the back and I mean it's a restaurant
5993000	5995000	Like I'll be right there
5995000	5996000	Okay um
5996000	5997000	I want uh
5997000	5999000	Doctor Friend and uh
5999000	6001000	Someone else with me in the front
6001000	6003000	So in case my spell doesn't work that I'm not
6003000	6005000	I have smoke bombs
6005000	6006000	I have smoke bombs
6006000	6007000	That's good
6007000	6010000	So I'm gonna come in behind you and I'll throw the smoke bomb if we need to
6010000	6013000	Let me be third so that I can close this to the vehicle
6013000	6015000	Cause I can keep it running and then jump into it
6015000	6016000	Okay good
6016000	6017000	Shit
6017000	6019000	So you're so so Hordaker's gonna be out back with the vehicle
6019000	6020000	Ready to rock
6020000	6021000	Right
6021000	6023000	He's our eyes and ears on the inside in case we need it
6023000	6026000	We're down to the last couple of minutes we have to do this now
6026000	6027000	Yeah we started late

6037000	6038000	I'll tell you what I'm afraid of
6038000	6040000	I'm afraid he's food
6040000	6041000	Yeah jellyfish is freezing
6041000	6042000	Yeah he's in the freezer
6042000	6043000	I'm afraid he's food
6043000	6047000	I'm afraid because he said that he wasn't a customer and he didn't work there
6047000	6049000	But he's in the freezer
6049000	6050000	Yeah
6051000	6053000	I know I hear you
6053000	6054000	You know?
6054000	6055000	Yeah
6055000	6056000	I think he may be burgers
6056000	6057000	Alright so here's the plan
6057000	6058000	I'm walking in there with who?
6058000	6059000	Who's coming in the front door with me?

6068000	6070000	It's an RE's predator that's hidden
6070000	6071000	And I also have a
6072000	6073000	A sleeve gun too that's hidden
6073000	6074000	I'll answer that
6074000	6075000	Yes they have metal detectors
6075000	6076000	Yeah they have metal

6095000	6097000	Could I throw in the smoke bombs
6097000	6099000	And that distracts everybody
6099000	6101000	You guys go in the back
6101000	6102000	While we're in the front
6102000	6104000	What are we doing with the distraction?
6104000	6105000	We're going in the back
6105000	6107000	They don't need to be distracted from us going in the back
6107000	6108000	We're going in the back
6108000	6110000	Spencer what are we trying to get?
6110000	6111000	A little boy

6121000	6123000	I'm not trying to slow it down
6123000	6124000	I'm just trying to understand
6124000	6125000	I'm unlocking the back door
6125000	6126000	Okay so we're going to save a little boy
6126000	6128000	Dan and I are going to go through the back
6128000	6129000	You guys are going in front
6129000	6130000	Use magic
6130000	6131000	Leave your weapons behind
6131000	6132000	You can't bring weapons in
6132000	6134000	Okay I stash my weapons in the van
6134000	6135000	We don't save this kid
6135000	6137000	I drop all my metal weapons in the van
6137000	6138000	I come in there ready to rock
6138000	6139000	With a major ass stun bolt
6139000	6140000	If it doesn't work I want
6140000	6142000	Doctor you drop those

6144000	6145000	Right and then I'll
6145000	6149000	Will my improved low light vision work in smoke Spencer or no?
6149000	6150000	Not through smoke
6150000	6151000	Not through smoke
6151000	6152000	Alright then we'll just
6152000	6153000	If it doesn't work out
6153000	6154000	We're just going to cross the ruckus
6154000	6155000	Start shooting the fucking place up
6155000	6156000	And get the hell out of there
6156000	6157000	Okay
6157000	6158000	I'm with you
6158000	6159000	Alright you guys ready to do this?
6159000	6160000	Ready

6162000	6163000	Yes
6163000	6164000	Okay
6164000	6165000	Probably
6165000	6166000	But most of you have your hands
6166000	6167000	It's your hair
6167000	6168000	Okay
6168000	6169000	What?
6169000	6171000	I walk in the front door and look for
6171000	6175000	And I say hey I walk up to the counter and
6175000	6178000	I want to have everybody where I can see
6178000	6180000	How big is the room by the way?
6180000	6182000	It's you know like McDonald's size
6182000	6186000	Okay cool so my stun ball should be enough to hit the whole thing probably
6186000	6189000	Not the whole room no you can probably hit about half of it
6189000	6192000	Alright so I walk in the front door and I look around and
6192000	6193000	Who do I see?
6193000	6196000	You see right up at the front is the security guard
6196000	6198000	He's wearing an armor plate and you also see
6198000	6201000	About three customers just kind of spread around tables
6201000	6206000	And then there's two fry cooks kind of milling about the auto fooders
6206000	6208000	Alright I put my hand on him and I have shot gloves
6208000	6210000	And I just try to stun him and knock him out
6210000	6211000	Who?
6211000	6212000	The security guard at the door
6212000	6213000	Alright
6214000	6216000	Stay in the pocket son
6216000	6217000	Yeah
6217000	6218000	Be ready to go doctor
6218000	6219000	I'm ready
6221000	6222000	Because
6222000	6224000	Because we're shadow running
6225000	6227000	It's not called shadow picnic
6228000	6231000	You you grab the guy right on his body part
6231000	6235000	And he starts to convulse wildly with electrical energy
6235000	6237000	He's he's shaking around
6237000	6240000	You should talk into the microphone so we can all hear it
6240000	6241000	He's conspiring
6241000	6244000	Sorry I'm sorry I'm just saying now we know shit's going down
6244000	6245000	To my comrades
6246000	6248000	We don't need to know that
6249000	6251000	Okay yeah he doesn't go down though
6251000	6252000	He's not unconscious
6252000	6253000	He's just
6253000	6254000	Shit's going down
6254000	6256000	Okay then I finish the job
6256000	6257000	Alright continue
6258000	6259000	Continue
6259000	6261000	It really is literally what he would say
6262000	6265000	He's actually just pulling an audible
6265000	6267000	I push him Spencer towards everyone else
6267000	6268000	It looks like a threat
6268000	6270000	Would they all be in one area enough for my stun ball to affect?
6271000	6272000	Wait what do you do?
6272000	6274000	I want to push this guy because he's not knocked out
6274000	6276000	I want to just kind of use him while he's stunned
6276000	6279000	And push him in toward the crowd and then stun ball the whole room
6279000	6280000	Sure
6280000	6281000	Objection
6281000	6282000	Objection
6282000	6283000	You can push him
6283000	6286000	Can my character step in front of this push and lock them?
6286000	6287000	No you're in the back
6287000	6288000	You're in the back
6288000	6289000	I'm in the back
6289000	6290000	Can my friends
6290000	6291000	You're with me
6291000	6292000	I'm unlocking the back door
6292000	6293000	Oh yeah you and I are together that's right
6293000	6294000	Just go like this
6294000	6295000	Sorry sorry
6295000	6299000	Alright I push him in there into the room and cast a force five stun ball on the whole ball of wax
6299000	6302000	Alright well before you can do that you start pushing him
6302000	6304000	And then two of the fry cooks draw guns on you
6306000	6307000	Smoke bombs
6307000	6308000	Smoke bombs
6314000	6316000	Perhaps more emphatically than that
6318000	6321000	Gun fire cuts through the the burger tyrant
6321000	6324000	But obscured by the smoke you manage to dodge all hits
6324000	6328000	I use my nimble cart like a gymnastic ability cartwheel away from all that stuff
6328000	6331000	And then where they were force five stun ball
6331000	6332000	Hi-ya-luku
6335000	6336000	Racist but effective
6340000	6343000	Alright it hits all of them
6343000	6344000	Yeah
6344000	6346000	They don't they don't get unconscious
6346000	6349000	They are punched as if in the face and they stumble back
6349000	6350000	Several steps
6351000	6353000	And then here I come
6353000	6354000	Yeah meanwhile in the back
6354000	6355000	Me too right
6355000	6356000	Yep
6356000	6357000	Okay
6357000	6359000	I'm behind Harmon I'm like sort of behind him
6359000	6361000	Yeah what are you guys doing while this
6361000	6362000	I got my Ares Predator out
6362000	6363000	Silencer
6363000	6365000	I'm coming in expecting this
6365000	6367000	My goal is to come in through the back
6367000	6368000	I'm expecting fry cooks
6368000	6370000	I'm expecting to take them out
6370000	6372000	Alright well you come into the storage room
6372000	6375000	There's potatoes and pickles
6375000	6376000	I don't care about them
6376000	6378000	You go into the main room
6378000	6380000	Oh there's also the freezer door to the right
6380000	6382000	And a manager's door to the left
6382000	6383000	Guard the freezer
6384000	6385000	I'm on it
6386000	6388000	And watch the manager's door
6388000	6390000	And then what else is there
6390000	6392000	There's just the door to the main
6392000	6394000	Oh we got a dirty manager
6394000	6396000	Because my plan is to meet the others in front
6396000	6397000	Nightblade are you in the comm?
6397000	6398000	I'm coming
6398000	6399000	Will you come in this room?
6399000	6401000	It's going to be full of smoke
6401000	6402000	You might not be able to see everything
6402000	6405000	It's called Nightblade
6406000	6407000	Doctor let's hit the dirt
6407000	6409000	So in case the bullets start flying
6409000	6410000	Just aim
6410000	6412000	Don't aim at the ground so we don't get hit
6412000	6413000	Have we caught up with these guys yet?
6413000	6414000	Yeah you're walking
6414000	6415000	Me?
6415000	6416000	Yeah yeah okay
6416000	6418000	Okay I'll do it up
6418000	6420000	So you burst open the door
6420000	6422000	And there's smoke pouring out everywhere
6422000	6425000	There's bullets flying all over the place
6425000	6426000	Cyber eyes
6426000	6427000	And people are screaming
6427000	6428000	You have
6428000	6429000	Cyber eyes
6429000	6430000	Those are the eyes you have
6430000	6432000	Those are my eyes
6432000	6433000	Cyber eyes
6433000	6434000	Yep
6434000	6435000	Low light
6436000	6438000	Flare reduction
6438000	6439000	Yep
6440000	6441000	Impenetrable
6441000	6443000	I was assuming smoke is to smoke then
6443000	6444000	Yep
6444000	6445000	Okay
6445000	6446000	Fuck

6447000	6450000	I never tested these things out
6450000	6452000	Cyber eyes
6452000	6455000	I just start shooting randomly
6455000	6456000	No I'm kidding
6456000	6457000	I move forward
6457000	6458000	We're on the ground Nightblade
6458000	6460000	The doctor and I have hit the dirt
6460000	6461000	So you have a clear shot
6461000	6463000	Do I see anything in front of me?
6463000	6465000	You see the fry cooks
6465000	6466000	They're firing into the smoke
6466000	6467000	Shoot them

6603000	6604000	I'm entering the building
6604000	6605000	There's smoke pouring everywhere
6605000	6608000	I have my smoke bombs with me also
6608000	6610000	But I've not used them
6610000	6614000	I'm crouching and using combat sense
6614000	6617000	To assess the situation and navigate myself
6617000	6619000	Closer to the point of impact
6619000	6621000	Your awareness is heightened
6621000	6623000	You have combat senses all about you
6623000	6625000	Combat it's imminent
6625000	6626000	It's good
6626000	6627000	I have a question

6631000	6633000	So what I'm going to do
6633000	6634000	I'm in the big room right
6634000	6637000	I'm going to do a physical barrier spell
6637000	6641000	That extends from the back room to the front door
6641000	6643000	Keeping all of the guys with guns
6643000	6645000	On the far side of the physical
6645000	6646000	Can I do that?
6646000	6650000	You can but you got Dan and Justin are on that side
6650000	6651000	I know that but they're going to go out
6651000	6654000	We ain't going to let you do that kind of nonsense
6654000	6656000	But in the meantime all of these people with guns
6656000	6658000	Are trapped in my physical barrier
6658000	6659000	Yeah
6659000	6660000	Can I do that?
6660000	6662000	Sure yeah because they're kind of in the same area right

6691000	6692000	Of force in the corner
6692000	6693000	But not limited
6693000	6694000	The autofooders
