0	8320	Welcome one and all to Dynasty typewriter downtown Los Angeles or there about.
8320	12240	Harman Town is once again in session.
12240	25640	Let's bring out the game master, Mrs. Spencer, creating him.
25640	32840	Oh yeah, Spencer's sitting down on his desk couch.
32840	38320	It's a cabinet, it's got drawers on it.
38320	42120	I'm talking about a full-on couch.
42120	44000	Of course, it's more like a love seat.
44000	45680	It's like a fainting couch.
45680	51080	Speaking of love, let's welcome the sexiest seat in town, the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
56480	59960	Oh, Tim.
59960	73240	Tim, Tim, thank you, thank you, thank you, thanks.
73240	76440	I have to pick and choose.
76440	81080	I had a couple things to talk about, but I got to go in order of importance or I'll forget
81080	91240	the most important thing, which is I looked into why balls hang off the body today and
91240	97680	for years, because I've always known that that explanation that you've heard, which
97680	104880	is like, oh, it takes like a degree cooler temperature for sperm to be either made or
104880	105880	stored.
105880	109440	And it's like, what?
109440	113040	They're telling me they didn't figure out a way, it's just something rang false about
113040	114040	it.
114040	117480	And I always say it was the most scientific explanation, it's like, oh, there needs to
117480	119240	be cooler down there.
119240	127240	And the thing that makes the most sense about what I learned is that part of the lie is
127240	128400	that that's true.
128400	132280	The balls are hanging down there for a temperature difference.
132280	138880	But the darker, more sinister thing is that it's not necessary.
138880	145000	It's not like, oh, it's a deal breaker for the evolution of life, God, there's no other
145000	146000	way to make sperm.
146000	154480	It could never happen, forget about storing them and, oh, boy, sperm, they're so delicate,
154480	158880	it's such an amazing process and it needs to be this certain temperature.
158880	163760	No, the sperm prefer it.
163760	169640	They live longer and use less resources, so it's like a Groupon.
169640	170640	It made such...
170640	171640	I was so...
171640	172640	I was like, that's it?
172640	173640	Oh, the sperm are.
173640	174640	They're running the show.
174640	175640	Like...
175640	179760	They got like a lever, they're pulling, they're like, let's take it up a notch, get these
179760	180760	balls down here.
180760	184760	There's that one sperm that comes into the ball and goes, is it hot in here?
184760	185760	Can I go check?
185760	188840	Can I go to the AC and make it a little cooler in here?
188840	192720	That is what they're doing because when sperm are...
192720	196360	There's such simple organisms, like little ants, I don't know if it's gross to think
196360	202440	about ants in your balls, but what they share is that there's no circulatory system, there's
202440	203440	nothing...
203440	211040	Look, sperm have a longer, more comfortable life in your balls than they would in a cup
211040	212920	of soup.
212920	213920	And it's because...
213920	217160	They get heat activated.
217160	220520	They know when they are and aren't in a vagina.
220520	226600	But if they feel like they're kind of in a vagina, well, then they'll just be all hustle
226600	232360	bustle and they'll run out of their little lunches that their daddy packed for them.
232360	235360	And the sperm can't have that.
235360	237560	They want to live all day.
237560	242720	They're just like, guys, that's what we are, we are a sperm.
242720	248840	If they live in a constant body temperature, 98.6 or whatever, and then they get into a
248840	252040	vagina, they're just gonna be like, they're still in the jacuzzi, they're still gonna
252040	253440	be relaxed and chilling out.
253440	254440	No.
254440	261120	When they get into a vagina, and this is why whenever you've wondered, you can understand
261120	265200	why a science class would avoid this semantically.
265200	269720	Because we're already uncomfortable, we're talking about, well, it knows when it's in
269720	270800	a pussy.
270800	277040	It's kind of weird to talk about, even in a health class or something, because it's
277040	281520	too much, sex ed, they try to keep it, they try to keep everything separate.
281520	285640	They're explaining all these things to you about what might happen and definitely shouldn't
285640	289520	happen, but why your body's going through changes.
289520	292800	Do you have sex ed in school?
292800	298280	But even if it's a co-ed thing, they kind of like, they don't, it's like they mention
298280	303560	the act, but it's like this idea of like, well, the sperm, what you guys need to understand
303560	308760	is that you're packing a population of 100 million torpedoes, and they want to be in
308760	312200	one place, and once they get there, it's on.
312200	317160	That's the part that's uncomfortable, is that when they get kind of heat activated, and
317160	322240	then they're like, this is it, I've been waiting my whole life, this is where I'm gonna die
322240	324920	here in this desert or whatever.
324920	333280	But they will also, the important thing to understand is that it's not like, it's not
333280	337920	that they would burst out on their own, because they'd get so excited because your balls would
337920	342660	be one degree warmer, it's the equivalent of them putting like cucumbers on their eyes
342660	344160	at night.
344160	351080	They're just living longer, they just want to be pretty, they want to be kept in a cooler
351080	352080	room.
352080	353080	It's self-care.
353080	354600	Because it makes them eat less, yeah.
354600	359040	It's like they're doing yoga or whatever, it's anything, it's like they're the sentience.
359040	366320	I've heard this thing on NPR about how when you're developing your first cells are your
366320	367320	gametes.
367320	374640	I mean, you are a 3D printer that refuses to, the species is like, I'm not gonna use
374640	381080	toner on a 3D printer that doesn't have a toner, because the whole point is making more
381080	382080	shit.
382440	388640	I imagine for all the things that could go wrong in the womb and during the gestation
388640	395440	from blastocysts to viable fetus, there's a whole room full of us experiencing the glorious
395440	401200	variations that can occur throughout that development, many of them totally precluding
401200	406400	an active chance at reproduction.
406400	409120	But nature is totally willing to lay those bets.
409120	413640	But if you were like in the womb and it was like something fucked with the whole point
413640	418760	of it, it probably shuts that down a thousand times more often, it's not gonna waste a penny
418760	419760	on you.
419760	425680	Your balls, your sperm are down in your balls wagging the dog of your whole life.
425680	430000	They're just like in a nice 95 degrees.
430000	431640	What a bunch of little dicks.
431640	438120	Am I making this up or did I overhear someone say that the slight variation of temperature
438120	441120	will decide whether it's male or female?
441120	444000	Well, alligators do it that way.
444000	451360	The alligators, their eggs, the temperature of them, look, I've been to Florida.
451360	456640	The alligators have that, the temperature determines gender of the eggs, so I don't get
456640	458040	that at all.
458040	465400	But it kind of goes to show you, we might overstate the importance of the intricate...
465440	470840	That's really shotgunning, that is playing like weird fire, isn't it?
470840	481240	The alligators have their gender determination plugged directly into the environment and
481240	482240	they're prehistoric.
482240	484800	They've been around forever.
484800	487960	So probably everything is just kind of an experiment.
487960	489960	There's nothing...
489960	494800	They take their sperm cell basically, their egg, and they put it in nature, and so nature
494800	498920	is alligators' balls.
498920	501920	But alligators do have balls.
501920	505080	I'm going to get that tattooed.
505080	507960	That's so much I believe in that statement.
507960	510880	Alligators have testes, but they're located on the inside of the alligator, which is a
510880	513680	natural place you'd put your testes.
513680	518120	But those sperm then would have to, they would live to half their age and they would feel
518120	519120	so...
519280	522200	Imagine the futility.
522200	523200	Imagine being a sperm...
523200	528760	I mean, they have a right to live their full sperm life.
528760	532240	How dare we?
532240	535280	And there's a muscle, it's something...
535280	539720	I made my employees look into this today.
539720	544120	When you have a writer's assistant, it's so much better than Googling.
544120	546360	You feel like you have this legitimacy.
546600	550800	Johnson, I want to report on everything about balls on my desk tomorrow morning.
550800	551800	Look at balls.
551800	552800	Look at balls.
552800	555880	How come balls are dangling, bro?
555880	559440	We're writing an episode about it.
559440	563120	Can't sue me.
563120	565840	Come on ladies, talk about balls with your boss.
565840	572000	I've learned nothing.
572000	575600	That just occurred to me.
575600	581480	How come balls are dangling is a great Google search string, I think.
581480	582480	You ever...
582480	585520	You know, I find myself saying this a lot lately when I...
585520	591400	I find myself consistently saying, I'll learn something and then I'll go, wow, that's simultaneously
591400	595360	uplifting and down trotting.
595360	596840	Is that happening to you as you get older?
596840	602480	Because it's like you're more tasting the sublime qualities of the universe and you're
602480	603480	kind of like...
604040	609040	Oh, that's an interesting story, but you don't get us fired up about, did the good guys win
609040	610440	or lose?
610440	612920	You're just kind of like, there's another one of those stories.
612920	617600	And you kind of start getting off on the equilibrium of it, like, I don't know who I'm rooting
617600	618600	for in that story.
618600	620240	Well, give me a for instance.
620240	623000	Ah, boy, jeez, I don't know.
623000	627960	For instance, ah, for cry-eye, ah, for cry-eye.
627960	630240	We don't remember nothing on this show.
630240	631240	I don't know.
631240	632240	I was just curious.
632240	633240	It doesn't matter.
634000	635000	Okay.
635000	641080	But that's a good segue because our guest is related to being high.
641080	643240	Whoa.
643240	647120	He made a little thing called Dope State for with my studio, Starburns.
647120	649520	Hell yeah, he did.
649520	650520	And he's our new friend.
650520	651520	Are you out there?
651520	652520	Are you back there, Gabe?
652520	653520	I guess it doesn't matter.
653520	654520	I think he's out there.
654520	662520	Please welcome your new friend Gabe Sunday to the stage.
662520	664320	Anywhere you like, but I think, oh, man.
664320	667160	Okay, so first question, where'd you get that outfit?
667160	668160	I need it.
668160	674280	Yeah, I wore this because this was my, like, comfy, this is like my comfy editing gear.
674280	675280	That's great.
675280	676280	I bought scrubs the other day.
676280	677760	And this is like an upgrade of that.
677760	683760	For those listening, he's got kind of a flight suit, like, military jumper kind of thing.
683760	685280	I got my super tight shirt on.
685280	686280	This is Starburns.
686280	687280	Starburns, right?
687280	688280	Yeah, super tight.
688280	692480	You look like a guy in Top Gun that, like, that's, it was like Top Gun's drug dealer.
692480	699640	The out, the out day one in Top Gun, the only one that's, like, you know.
699640	702440	You had clearance to get on the base, but they made you wear that, so you looked like
702440	703440	you kind of fit in.
703440	704440	Right, right, right.
704440	705440	I got too high.
705440	706440	I got too high.
706440	707440	That's perfect.
707440	708440	That's good.
708440	709440	That's perfect, man.
709440	710760	That's great, man.
710760	713360	Do you find yourself when you, do you ever get too high?
713360	714840	I'll ask that question first.
714840	715840	Absolutely.
715840	718560	I'm very, I have a very precarious relationship with Maro.
718560	724240	I mean, I don't, I'm, I can't, I do crave it because it's my, it's what, it's, I made
724240	725400	a show about weed.
725400	727440	It's like a mockumentary comedy series.
727440	729360	Well, let's get to that in a second.
729360	730360	Okay, okay.
730360	731360	Tell me about what you were saying.
731360	732360	Yeah, I, I.
732360	733360	Jesus.
733360	734360	I, I.
734360	735360	No, that's good.
735360	736360	That was good.
736360	739000	Or just start naming fruits and I'll forget what I asked.
739000	740000	Oh yeah.
740000	741000	Stop saying.
741000	743320	You do have options.
743320	744320	Stop saying what you're saying.
744320	746720	We'll get, go back to what you were saying.
746720	747720	Yeah.
747960	749960	Yeah, I, I'm uncomfortable too, Dan.
749960	750960	That's good.
750960	751960	I'm in my own head.
751960	754800	When you get too high, can you describe getting too high?
754800	758280	Because people use the word paranoid and when I was in my twenties, I never understood
758280	761520	what the old guys meant when they said, I can't smoke pot anymore.
761520	762520	I get paranoid.
762520	766560	And I never knew, I was like, they first, that sounds fun.
766560	772880	Like what you, you, you take a drug that makes you think people are out to get you because
772880	775520	nobody's ever been out to get you when you're 20.
775520	777880	And so you're like, that sounds like a, a pill I'd take.
777880	778880	Right.
778880	779880	Right.
779880	780880	Right.
780880	781880	Yeah.
781880	782880	Like I play video games to be paranoid, but then, and then, and then, and then sometime
782880	783880	in my thirties, I'm going to use my I statements.
783880	787560	I keep using you and I'm like, come on Harmon, speak for yourself.
787560	793320	Sometime in my thirties, I just, I had that first like, Oh, I got too high and I shouldn't
793320	795360	be because I'm 30.
795360	801000	And then, uh, I have rent due tomorrow and like the highness turn.
801000	804080	I think that's what, I think that's what people mean when they talk about paranoid.
804080	808800	I think marijuana shows us things that we need to be attentive and pay attention to,
808800	811560	you know, it's like, fuck, gotta call my dad back.
811560	815600	It's been a few weeks and fuck, I got to check the thing and like, uh, this doesn't feel
815600	816600	good.
816600	817600	Like what's here?
817600	818760	Is this like the lung or is this like the liver?
818760	821960	Like I gotta go, you know, and like you start getting your head about that and I really
821960	826840	do feel like pot is a thing that points out things you need to be attentive to.
826840	830900	And part of like one of the reason where I think paranoia and uncomfortableness comes
830900	835500	from is like people who maybe need to just check in with like breathing and just being
835500	836740	in their moment and blah, blah, blah.
836740	841360	But yeah, to answer your question, most times I smoke weed, I'm like, fuck, I always forget
841360	842660	this part where I smoke.
842660	844980	And then I'm like, Oh, we're back here again.
844980	848420	You know, it's like, Oh, you know, now I'm in that place.
848420	851980	How long is this going to take part of our group that I travel with a lot, um, as a guy
851980	855780	we travel with and he doesn't like to fly and he takes his little tight, like really,
855780	861220	really low dosage, like little mints that are weedy, you know, kind of edible mints.
861220	862220	Weedies.
862220	863220	Weedies.
863220	864220	Yeah.
864220	868780	You got Bruce Jenner's on the cover of the thing.
868780	869780	That's how old he is.
869780	873580	And, uh, he gave me when he's like, they put you right to sleep.
873580	877500	Like I said, I sleep on plants, but they're so relaxing and took all the anxiety that
877500	880900	I feel like, like there's, you won't even know that you've taken it.
880900	883100	I took it and I was freaking out.
883100	888340	I'm going to play with my head in my hands going, Oh, like, ah, like get me off of this
888340	889340	fucking thing.
889340	893980	It's like, I remember being in an animal collective concert and biting my hand until it bled because
893980	896580	I needed to be rooted in like reality.
896580	900780	Like I, I bit my hand until I like, I was the guy in the crowd who was like, I'm having
900780	901780	a good time.
901780	905420	Like, you know, like, like this is fucking great at strawberry jam.
905420	909460	And like, and I would say that like most of the times whenever I've been in like a, because
909460	913740	I made a weed show, which by the way, makes it very difficult to sell your show because
913740	918340	broad city, they can smoke all weed all day, but they won't sell commercials to a weed
918340	919340	thing.
919340	920340	Anyway, that's the whole type of thing.
920340	924540	The thing about weed is like, if you're in a weed show and you go to it like a serious
924540	927340	meeting or like a blah, blah, blah, it's always like, Oh, we brought weed because you're the
927340	928540	fucking weed guy.
928540	931420	Like you like being really high, really, really high right now.
931420	936780	And it just becomes a thing that it's so normalized, but I'm still not, I have a very love hate
936780	937780	relationship with pot.
937780	940540	I think it's a really fucking heavy drug.
940540	941540	Spencer.
941540	942540	Hey guys.
942540	943540	Should be respected.
943540	947180	I, uh, I understand fashion when I'm high.
947180	954460	I put on, I smoke a, I smoke a doobie and then I'm like, yo, I need long pants.
954460	955620	What's going on?
955620	960980	I mean, I, I mean, it's true and that, that manifest, it's like that a thing of like,
960980	964580	it's like changing what you're paying attention to, which never occurred to me.
964580	968660	That's exactly what it does, which, which if you're doing well, if you're in a good
968660	974500	space, it could be like your girlfriend's bra strap or the fact that, uh, uh, you need
974500	979660	to breathe like, but in a good way, no, it's, it's like, I was trying to create a list cause
979660	982500	I was like, why did you, why was your girlfriend's start?
982500	984460	Like that's a bad one item list.
984460	987500	Cause now you're just a pervy, pervy guy.
987500	993340	That's like, sometimes the grass makes me twitchy, but it's cool with the chicks.
993340	998700	I just, I just like, I, I became a dazed and confused character, which I've never seen
998700	1002620	the movie, but I saw the trailer and like, I just, I'm so high.
1002620	1007300	And then I, like right now there's paranoia, there's a voice going like, look at you, look
1007300	1008300	at you.
1008300	1009300	Listen to yourself.
1009300	1010300	Are you listening to yourself?
1010300	1011300	That's my paranoia.
1011300	1013180	When I get paranoid, I was like, everybody knows that I'm too high and they're going
1013180	1014180	to make fun of me.
1014180	1017820	They're going to, they're going to ridicule me for being high and poke fun at me and well,
1017820	1021540	I'm here to tell you, that's how you'll live.
1021540	1023300	What's your, what's your own comfort right now?
1023300	1024300	You're at your own show.
1024300	1028180	Like it was parking or like, Oh no, well I know it, but it truly is.
1028180	1030940	It's funny how it's not always like, Oh, a mortgage in it.
1030940	1033460	I I've got to hunt a spotted leopard next Wednesday.
1033460	1038140	I'm trying to make up anxieties, try to improvise a list of anxieties.
1038140	1039140	Number one was mortgage.
1039140	1042580	And then I went straight to mythical creature hunting because I've never had to worry about
1042580	1043580	anything.
1043580	1045820	Dan, go back to what you're saying.
1045820	1048820	Like that was where a normal person would have like, I've got to clean the gutters or
1048860	1055860	tie my shoes or, you know, not enjoy total fucking psychic hegemony over all creatures
1055860	1061900	great and small to the point where I have to create my own crises so that I can feel
1061900	1062900	valuable.
1062900	1069180	I can feel the tension of me pushing up against failure, like otherwise I don't know if I'm
1069180	1070180	alive.
1070180	1073300	I, uh, anyways, so you made this, uh, I'm just really happy.
1073300	1074300	I'm not high right now.
1074300	1077620	Like I would be staring at you being like, gotta think the funny thing.
1077620	1078620	Got it.
1078620	1079620	Got a volley.
1079620	1080620	You got a volley off that.
1080620	1081620	All right.
1081620	1083620	So tell us about dope state.
1083620	1084620	Yeah.
1084620	1086820	Thank you for saying great smile from Jeff.
1086820	1088620	I'm feeling rooted on here.
1088620	1093220	Uh, dope states show we made it Starburst industries took a couple of years and was
1093220	1099380	a, uh, uh, it's a mockumentary set in the cannabis culture boom in California.
1099380	1106260	And I play a handful of characters, dab girls, uh, daddies, um, uh, dealer or no, you play
1106260	1107620	a dealer in it.
1107620	1111540	And, uh, and then we're surrounded by a lot of comedians, most of which are in the Starburst
1111540	1114720	space, at least some degree kind of passing through and showing everything from like Silicon
1114720	1119460	Valley culture to the people getting pushed out of the industry, which is what I grew
1119460	1124100	up around, you know, growers and dealers who are now getting pushed out because of dispensaries
1124100	1125100	and all that.
1125100	1130740	So this first season, six episodes on Pluto TV, uh, and it really focuses on the old school
1130740	1131740	pot game.
1131740	1137540	That's being like completely just decimated by big, the big cannabis boom right now.
1137540	1139580	Pluto TV, Pluto TV.
1139580	1140580	It's free TV.
1140580	1143020	Spence on Pluto and earth.
1143020	1144020	Yeah.
1144020	1145020	Yeah.
1145020	1146020	Channel four 20.
1146020	1147020	We're on the wheat channel channel.
1147020	1148020	Whoa.
1148020	1149020	Yeah.
1149020	1150740	Pluto TV is channel four 20.
1150740	1151740	No, no, no.
1151740	1153860	It's four 20 on, on Pluto TV.
1153860	1158220	So you get on your phone and then channel four 20 is the, is the way the weed, the weed
1158220	1159220	channel.
1159220	1164300	A few days ago, Cody informed me was the, uh, your last chance to get married and have
1164300	1168100	your 50th anniversary be on, uh, four 20, 69.
1168100	1169100	Yeah.
1169100	1174340	And we were like, we were reaching for the keys, like on our way to city hall.
1174340	1179460	And then we were like, can you imagine trying to get that laugh 50 years from now?
1179460	1186620	You'd, you'd, you'd be like, first I have to explain calendars to a fucking hologram
1186620	1188260	of a, of Pokemon.
1188260	1192500	That's just like coming through my ID because no one's real anymore.
1192500	1194100	Like there is no people.
1194100	1198260	There would be, there's no, if there's people 50 years from now, I quit.
1198260	1199260	I quit.
1199260	1200260	Yeah.
1200260	1201260	Sorry.
1201260	1207060	Do you, what do you, do you have any opinions about the corporatization of marijuana?
1207060	1212780	Uh, I think it's, you know, there's, there's the, the schism schism between, uh, legalization
1212780	1214620	and decriminalization.
1214620	1219700	And obviously in California we chose legalization and that opens the door for big businesses
1219700	1225540	to steal all the businesses of honest drug dealers without, you know, preventing drug
1225540	1230020	dealings, just selling a product, you know, the medicine people do it and we, we say it's
1230020	1233780	great, but, uh, you know, they're just taking all the business from all these, these earnest
1233780	1238060	hardworking folk that have been fulfilling a big need and getting arrested for it, which
1238060	1239060	is bad.
1239060	1242700	And obviously they're not, I don't even know why I have to ask this out loud, but because
1242700	1244740	there's probably some discussion about it.
1244740	1247780	Why am I you explaining why you ask questions?
1247780	1253220	Cause you're high, you're high as batpussy right now.
1253220	1254220	Whoa.
1254220	1255220	Batpussy.
1255220	1257060	And they sleep upside down.
1257060	1258060	No, belfries.
1258060	1259060	Yeah, they sleep upside down.
1259060	1262340	That's about as high as, that's about as high as it gets.
1262340	1264620	They live in belfries and they sleep upside down.
1264620	1268300	I heard that from Steve Agee, I'm like, that's the greatest stuff I've ever heard in my life.
1268300	1271700	You don't get any higher in the animal kingdom than a batpussy.
1272420	1274540	They sleep on the ceiling, but upside down.
1274540	1276700	So their head is lower than their person.
1276700	1281700	And it's not just bat genitals because, uh, the male bat penis immediately flaps down
1281700	1283940	like an ironing board in a hotel.
1283940	1288140	As soon as it goes to sleep and it's just every inch counts that ask the people that
1288140	1289140	built the belfry.
1289140	1290140	Why'd you put that cross up there?
1290140	1294100	If it wasn't to beat the church across the street, you know, in this arms race for God's
1294100	1295100	grace.
1295100	1296100	What am I saying?
1296100	1297140	No, this is good.
1297140	1298140	This is good.
1298140	1306580	The legalization is basically as speed stuff, what, what, why the propositions are passed
1306580	1309140	and then, um, legalization is pushed through.
1309140	1310660	I get you some popcorn or something like that.
1310660	1315620	You want, you want some pizza, all the police just, oh, I did.
1315620	1316620	They're coming.
1316620	1320700	I just want to, I just want to talk to someone that will put me straight.
1320700	1324940	No, this is actually perfect because I'm experiencing the other side of the pot thing.
1324940	1329020	Like if you having a little bit of like uncomfort, I was really high yesterday at the Renaissance
1329020	1330020	fair.
1330020	1331020	Oh yeah.
1331020	1332660	We didn't go to another rent.
1332660	1334420	George RR Martin was there two years ago.
1334420	1335420	I saw him.
1335420	1337380	He had a little like dinky dragon on his shoulder.
1337380	1340820	Like he was walking around just buying his meats and drink.
1340820	1346140	He looked, he was, he was having a ball just buying his but, but I'm, I'm a great butcher
1346140	1347140	shop there.
1347140	1350660	You go get a nice tenderloin, a big turkey leg.
1350660	1351660	Yeah.
1352300	1358780	I'm experiencing the next day, weed, lackadaisical lethargia of like the mind of like bad pussy.
1358780	1360620	I got something to say about that.
1360620	1365420	And then it's like, uh, like someone pressing against my forehead, just like setting me
1365420	1366420	back.
1366420	1367420	Like that's what I get.
1367420	1370940	That's the negative side effects for weed for me is like the hangover is like that.
1370940	1371940	Yeah.
1371940	1372940	The weed hangover.
1372940	1373940	I hate the weed hangover.
1373940	1374940	I love it.
1374940	1378060	I, uh, I actually, I'm, I'm trying to stop smoking weed.
1378060	1381500	I've been getting paranoia and panic attacks lately.
1382260	1383260	I was in line somewhere.
1383260	1384780	I thought I was having a heart attack.
1384780	1385780	Yeah.
1385780	1389820	I might've been having a heart attack and you pace back and forth and you're like checking
1389820	1393220	your pulse because if you're going to have a heart attack, you want to be the first to
1393220	1394220	know.
1394220	1395220	Right.
1395220	1397300	You're the, I mean, no one else is going to know that kids is to just always check your
1397300	1398300	pulse.
1398300	1399300	Is that just after smoking?
1399300	1400300	Like you just after smoking?
1400300	1401300	It was in that case.
1401300	1402300	Yeah.
1402300	1407260	Do you know, uh, in these war movies, you know, like a bombshell goes off nearby the
1407260	1411420	person and they have this ring in their ears and they can't hear anything that was happening
1411420	1412420	to me.
1412420	1414100	And I was like, wait, that doesn't happen in real life.
1414100	1415100	That's a movie thing.
1415100	1416100	I'm dying.
1416100	1421500	And no, I swear I was going to mention that like I, I, and then I thought, don't bring
1421500	1422500	that up.
1422500	1426220	Like that's not, that's a subjective experience for you, but interesting that you brought
1426220	1427220	that up.
1427220	1428220	Yeah.
1428220	1430580	Cause you've probably heard people say I get panic attacks and I never looked up what a
1430580	1431580	panic attack was.
1431580	1433460	And I was like, yeah, I freak out all the time.
1433460	1434460	What?
1434460	1436820	But like, no, a panic attack is like a medical thing where it feels like you're having a
1436820	1437820	heart attack or whatever.
1437820	1438820	It's terrifying.
1438820	1440220	And, uh, that's been happening.
1440220	1441220	It's no good.
1441220	1444420	I, I smoked on four 20, but I haven't really smoked the last couple of weeks.
1444420	1446260	I don't, I don't think I'm going to keep smoking.
1446260	1453820	Now, do you think gentlemen for the panel, yes, do you think that that is a function
1453820	1460780	of biology, uh, chemicals or anything, or is that more psychology, your, your life changing
1460780	1467740	and getting, getting high, having the same effect on you, that you're, you're, um, parsing
1467740	1470980	it differently because you've, you're, you're life has changed.
1470980	1473020	I would guess aging has something to do with it.
1473020	1477420	And I've read just long-term weed use leads to different side effects than short-term
1477420	1478420	weed use.
1478420	1481460	So after you've been doing it for several years, it can actually affect you psychologically
1481460	1484060	differently than the first seven years or something.
1484060	1486420	So it might just be like late weed use or something.
1486420	1487420	Yeah.
1487420	1488420	When did we become such squares?
1488420	1492380	I mean, I've, I've heard, but I think it's pretty common for people as they get older
1492380	1498100	to be like, I was really into weed and then now I'm feeling like all those negative things
1498100	1505300	and I've got no time for it, but like it, it does, yeah, it has, especially being recently
1505300	1508980	like doing promotion and all this for this and like I've been thrusted into the scene
1508980	1512380	of like go weed, like it's the fucking thing for everything.
1512380	1513380	Oh yeah.
1513380	1514380	CBD.
1514380	1515380	Yeah.
1515380	1518100	And CBD, and I've had some really good experiences with CBD that didn't freak me out, but like
1518100	1522460	it's still, it's still a pretty intense drug that thrown into, it's just not all the heal
1522460	1523460	all end all.
1523460	1527100	And I think it's more of that, it's got this collective excitement behind it, which is
1527100	1528100	wonderful.
1528100	1532260	Like I love that, but it's also like, you know, you can't, you can't throw it into any
1532260	1535620	mental situation, you know, and, and especially like edibles.
1535620	1539780	Like I thank God we're in a day where you can pick out the thing for the airport because
1539780	1544060	like, okay, my mom would hate that I would tell, my mom would not like that.
1544060	1547220	I would tell this story because she still, there's still a little shame in my family
1547220	1551780	between weed, but my mom grew pot this year and like she got like two pounds.
1551780	1552780	It was like a huge amount.
1552780	1553780	I don't know.
1553780	1554780	Is that like an illegal amount?
1554780	1555780	What's your address?
1555780	1559820	Are you gonna get like raided now?
1559820	1563740	And my mom was like, she doesn't smoke, but she wanted to like make it for her kid and
1563740	1564740	his friends.
1564740	1566620	She wanted to give it a shot.
1566620	1567620	She grew two pounds.
1567620	1571020	Well, she's a fucking Bay Area, like green thumb lady.
1571020	1572020	She's like, I plan in the pot.
1572020	1574780	I was going to say like, is she a CIA agent?
1574780	1579440	Like, is it like everything she does or no, she's a, she's got a green thumb.
1579440	1580440	That's adorable.
1580440	1581440	Yeah, it was adorable.
1581800	1589560	And so my adorable 72 year old mother, 71, she was cooking it to make us these little
1589560	1591280	space balls.
1591280	1594200	And when you cook THC, so what's a space ball?
1594200	1597560	Space ball is like a little thing like, like this big and you put, is that like not a term
1597560	1598560	that people know?
1598560	1601680	It's like a baked good, like a space cake, space cake, I've heard of it, but these are
1601680	1603600	just coming through a lyrical form.
1603600	1604600	Like Munchy.
1604600	1605600	Yeah.
1605600	1606600	A little Munchy thing.
1606600	1607600	They're a healthy man out of organic stuff.
1607600	1614480	What they didn't know is that when you cook it into oil, that psycho, that psychoactivates,
1614480	1618000	Jesus, that psychoactivates the weed and then it's.
1618000	1621040	It catalyzes the psychoactivization of process.
1621040	1622040	All right.
1622040	1623040	All right.
1623040	1624040	I mean.
1624040	1625040	Science word.
1625040	1626040	If you want to get.
1626040	1627040	It's illogical.
1627040	1628600	It intensifies the psychoactive property.
1628600	1629600	No, no, no.
1629600	1630600	It turns it on, right?
1630600	1633840	Weed is not, the psychoactive property of weed is not really turned on unless it's heat
1633840	1635420	activated from what I know.
1635420	1639380	And when you put that into oil and you cook it, it's hot.
1639380	1640380	It's ready.
1640380	1645660	And my mom then, without gloves, started making these little space cakes with like.
1645660	1649100	Oh, this is not where I thought the story was going at all.
1649100	1653740	So I get a call from my sister, I'm in a wedding and I get a call, gotta come home.
1653740	1654740	Oh my God.
1654740	1655740	Mom is like, is gone.
1655740	1659660	I was like, well, I had one of them, like it's a little heavy, but like just, you know,
1659660	1662380	tell her to sit down, put on some discovery, whatever.
1662380	1667980	And I come home and my mom had ingested like an ounce of pot and she was, she was puking,
1667980	1669740	she was freaking out.
1669740	1676320	Watching my mother, you know, go through like a bad trip, which was all, you know, it was,
1676320	1678180	she was so scared.
1678180	1684620	And I sat with her and she was like, Gabe's home, Gabe, Gabe, you know, like it was like
1684620	1689140	death bed shit, you know, and I like, and I can't, and she was like grabbing for me.
1689140	1690700	She was like, I can't look, it's too bright.
1690700	1694980	And every time she'd open her eyes, she'd be like, oh no, like it's too bright.
1694980	1699340	And then she's like, did red dead redemption come out yet?
1699340	1700340	I missed it.
1700340	1704700	You're like, mom, I've never seen you like this.
1704700	1708500	And she, and she like grabbed me and like held me and like held my hand and she was
1708500	1709500	like shaking.
1709500	1712660	And I was, I was like, mom, I've been to Burning Man like eight times.
1712660	1716780	You're the fucking highest person I've ever seen.
1716780	1718020	And it was legit.
1718020	1719060	It was topical.
1719060	1721140	It was like, it went into her hands.
1721140	1722900	She didn't smoke any of it.
1722900	1728380	And then it got awesome because I sat with her and we did like technically Han like breathing
1728380	1729380	shit.
1729380	1732740	And like, I leaned into her ear and I was like, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in,
1732740	1733740	breathe.
1733740	1734740	I sat with her for two hours.
1734740	1739300	And pretty soon my mom was like, we're spinning to the left, Gabe, and you're with me and
1739300	1746180	it's us and we're spinning to the left, to the left, to the left.
1746180	1748660	That got, that made me so relaxed just now.
1749260	1750260	I recorded it.
1750260	1754140	She was like, listen to what I'm saying to you and never forget.
1754140	1757380	And it was always to the left, right?
1757380	1758380	Back into the left.
1758380	1761620	It was like, oh, the Holocaust happens.
1761620	1763100	Don't let them convince you.
1763100	1764100	Follow the money.
1764100	1767620	Soil and green is people, everything to the left.
1767620	1768620	She came out.
1768620	1771500	She was like, get everybody from the family out here right now.
1771500	1772500	So we all come out.
1772500	1773500	My dad's there.
1773500	1777660	My dad, who has no idea how to handle this shit, he's like, honey, your kids love you.
1777660	1779620	My mom's like, stop it.
1779620	1782980	Don't talk to me about anything.
1782980	1784940	Like it was like, it was coming up.
1784940	1792460	And I was like, mom, Jesus, Lord, like, you know, like, so we ended up holding hands and
1792460	1797180	like, and like I was crying and she was crying and it like.
1797180	1801180	And to what extent I get the feeling, I think from talking to you before, but I kind of
1801180	1806500	hope I'm wrong that your parents are kind of, you know, on the, on the front side of
1806500	1811820	this, this box, your parents aren't like principles in a Pringles commercial.
1811820	1815340	They're, they're, your parents are, we're hippies, right?
1815340	1816340	Mrs. Mike Pence.
1816340	1817340	Yeah.
1817340	1818340	Yeah.
1818340	1819340	Back into the left.
1819340	1820340	Fuck mother.
1820340	1825220	No flavor crystals in my library.
1825220	1826220	Whoa.
1826220	1829060	It's fucking reefer.
1829060	1831420	It's a little, but somehow that makes it more.
1831420	1832420	Yeah.
1832420	1833420	I mean, she grew it.
1833420	1834420	And my dad, she grew it.
1834420	1836980	That's all you need to know about that answer.
1836980	1841020	But she grew it and uh, and then my dad was like, yeah, he just was uncomfortable about
1841020	1842020	the whole thing.
1842020	1843020	Yeah.
1843020	1846860	I mean, we're in like the Bay area and you know that, but I still say to anybody listening,
1846860	1850360	you know, with the whole normalization of shit, we got to catch up with this crap.
1850360	1853620	You fucking can't cook your weed and touch it with your hands.
1853620	1856900	Like that must be happening all over to moms.
1856900	1863060	I went to moms across the nation, making their kids up their, their weed and sort of
1863060	1867180	give me a big ball of hash and I, um, and I, someone told me how to make butter out
1867180	1868180	of it.
1868180	1871540	And so I made this just like butter, the exact color of your jumpsuit, like this is really
1871540	1873940	khaki green, like really into the gym.
1873940	1878100	And uh, and he'd show me how to make butter and I did, I did heat it.
1878100	1883540	I put it in the thing and I made, uh, I made cookies out of it and I thought, I'm going
1883540	1888180	to, I'm going to take a half a cookie, give it like a few hours, let's do the baseline
1888180	1892900	control group thing and see if it, I got, yeah, I got, I got a little high, it was good.
1892900	1896660	And I was dating a chick at the time and she came over and we were going to go out and
1896660	1897660	do something.
1897660	1902580	And I, I didn't, I forgot all about it that I'd taken it and I wasn't like tripping, you
1902580	1904060	know, like crazy.
1904060	1911260	And she's sitting on my couch and she's like, Jeff, Jeff, I kind of snap out of a trance.
1911260	1915340	I go, I go, oh, oh, oh, sorry, what?
1915340	1917460	And she goes, are you okay?
1917460	1918460	I'm like, what's going on?
1918460	1921620	And she goes, you've been standing, looking at the window for 10 minutes.
1921620	1925940	I was like, yeah, that tree.
1925940	1926940	I was there.
1926940	1927940	She's like, she sat there.
1927940	1928940	She's like, what is he doing?
1928940	1931780	I said, oh, oh yeah, I got high earlier.
1931780	1933900	So then I go, these are pretty good.
1933900	1937580	And uh, I took two and went to, here's a bad idea.
1938580	1941620	Anybody see the movie Coraline?
1941620	1942620	Don't see it.
1942620	1943620	In 3D?
1943620	1944620	Yeah.
1944620	1946700	Do not, do not see that on way too much edibles.
1946700	1947700	I was sitting with Jay J.
1947700	1955780	Jeff, that movie never came out in 3D, 3D, 3D, 3D.
1955780	1962820	That was, that was a rare 2D only movie by decree of a special dimensional commission.
1962820	1966420	I was with Jay Johnston and somebody else, maybe Mark Rivers, I don't know who it was.
1966420	1969460	And I was like, like so freaked out.
1969460	1970820	I was so paranoid.
1970820	1975940	I couldn't breathe and I, I couldn't do the 3D thing because they were flying into my
1975940	1976940	head.
1976940	1977940	Sure.
1977940	1978940	And it was, it was like, get outside.
1978940	1979940	All the Corallines.
1979940	1985340	I was trying to defend my brain from all of these demons and monsters and shit coming
1985340	1986340	at me.
1986340	1992060	But if I took the glasses off, that's worse because now it's all blurry and fucked up.
1992060	1994100	So I just, and I didn't want to just sit there with my head in my hands.
1994100	1997900	I want the arc light right in the middle and it was, it's so dark in there and the
1997900	1998900	arc light in Hollywood.
1998900	1999900	I'm sure they all are.
1999900	2000900	No man.
2000900	2006900	As opposed to those really bright movie, the Hollywood run is fucking dark.
2006900	2013340	I'm like fucking, I could see my popcorn bro.
2013340	2015020	It's like, film snobs go there.
2015020	2020780	It's like a richer black, it's a, it's a, it's a higher quality black.
2020780	2024460	It brings out the silver and the nitrate behind the film.
2024460	2025460	Yeah.
2025460	2026460	Yeah.
2026460	2027460	Yeah.
2027460	2028460	No exit signs.
2028460	2031540	If I try to get up and walk out here, I'm going to, I'm going to fall over everybody
2031540	2034060	and I'm going to break my neck and make a fool of myself.
2034060	2036380	It's like, I'm not going to make it through this movie.
2036380	2039860	And I wanted just to sit there with my head in my hands, but then I was going to ruin
2039860	2041900	the movie for my people next to me.
2041900	2043420	So I tough it out.
2043420	2048300	And I don't remember anything about that movie except my own, just freak out.
2048300	2052780	And we all went and we went our separate ways at the end.
2052780	2059220	I think we all met there and like, I calmed down towards the end and the next day I called
2059220	2062660	up those guys I was with and I said, Hey, I'm sorry, I don't know if you noticed, I'm
2062660	2063660	sorry.
2063660	2070020	Like I was fucking high and like I was freaking out the whole movie and they're like, dude,
2070020	2071580	I was too.
2071580	2073260	All three of us were in the exact same boat.
2073260	2078260	We were afraid to like, if I would have known that we would just talk about it, man.
2078460	2079460	To the left.
2079460	2080460	To the left.
2080460	2087100	You guys were all like, man, of all the nights to roll with the Coraline intensive crew.
2087100	2090780	Like, you're like, shit, fuck.
2090780	2095540	You're supposed to be totally intense about watching Coraline in this group.
2095540	2097940	You were all just high.
2097940	2101580	If you know where I live and you go through my trash can, when's trash day?
2101580	2102580	Thursday?
2102580	2103580	Yeah.
2103580	2108220	If you go through my trash can, there's drugs in there because somebody gave me these beautifully
2108220	2112380	noted.
2112380	2114540	That's a great cold open to your next story.
2114540	2116140	Is that what that is?
2116140	2117140	Is that what that was?
2117140	2119460	What a paranoid thing to say, Jeff.
2119460	2122220	It was like a Wizard of the Ed panel right before it all.
2122220	2123420	You fucking all know where I live.
2123420	2124700	I know you're going through my fucking trash.
2124700	2128380	If you do it again tonight, hi folks, my name is Jeff Davis.
2128380	2129380	Who am I?
2129380	2130380	Let's put it this way.
2130380	2132900	You go through my trash tomorrow, there'll be drugs there.
2132900	2133900	Welcome to the show.
2134660	2137340	I'll lock the hash browns and scrambled eggs.
2137340	2141060	And then you're like, anyways, the A story this week is I lost my keys.
2141060	2143820	Anyways, can I continue, please?
2143820	2151140	So there's a guy that used to go to the drawing room and he's, let's call him a drug dealer.
2151140	2156380	And get rid of this shame culture.
2156380	2157380	Yeah.
2157380	2158380	Yeah.
2158380	2160220	Just be a drug dealer.
2160220	2164180	He brought drug flavored drugs and I'd paid him money for them.
2164180	2167740	And then he had money and then I had drugs and now some of them are in the trash can.
2167740	2173420	Stop calling yourself a friend that has drugs when your friends have money and want drugs.
2173420	2175340	You're a drug dealer, man.
2175340	2176340	Exactly.
2176340	2177340	Own it.
2177340	2181300	So he gave me, he's given me a wide variety of like, I like the more of the hallucinogenic
2181300	2186380	thing and so he gives me mushrooms sometimes and he gave me some acid once and I took it
2186380	2188660	too late and I fell asleep and don't sleep on acid.
2188660	2190780	That's the worst.
2190780	2192900	What happens when you sleep on acid?
2192900	2193900	Fucking incredible.
2193900	2196500	I fell asleep on the couch.
2196500	2198540	I watched Cabaret, the movie.
2198540	2199540	Oh my God.
2199540	2200540	It's great.
2200540	2201540	Like on acid?
2201540	2202540	On acid.
2202540	2203540	It was fantastic.
2203540	2204540	But then I fell asleep on the couch.
2204540	2205540	Oh, Cabaret on acid.
2205540	2206540	Fucking do it.
2206540	2208220	Too demonic, but without the acid.
2208220	2209220	Is it an aversion?
2209220	2212700	It starts up, I had to hit pause and I'm like, I've seen this movie a hundred times.
2212700	2215780	I'm like, I'm going to watch Cabaret on acid.
2215780	2218620	And Joel Grey's face pops up on the first scene with a psh.
2218620	2219620	Gah!
2219620	2221980	And his face was like this Ralph Steadum drawing.
2221980	2223460	It was fucking great.
2223460	2224460	Oh.
2224460	2225460	Oh yeah.
2225460	2233460	So anyway, I fell asleep and I was still really going and you're inside this crazy
2233460	2237500	like fireball of imagery that's inside your eyelids.
2237500	2239900	A champagne supernova?
2239900	2244140	You have to keep opening your eyes to like, to get back to like, just where's the plant?
2244140	2245140	Where's the TV?
2245140	2247020	Like, plant me somewhere.
2247020	2250060	You close, you're tripping with your eyes closed.
2250060	2251060	Half asleep.
2251060	2252060	Don't do it.
2252060	2253060	I don't recommend that.
2253060	2255660	At any rate, he came in one day and he goes, hey, I've got these things.
2255660	2256660	I know you like mushrooms.
2256660	2257660	He goes, I've got these.
2257660	2261100	They look, you know, the little dove chocolate bars, little tiny ones that are wrapped in
2261100	2262100	the red foil.
2262100	2264820	They're kind of, you know, square and rounded on the top.
2264820	2269740	They look exactly like that, like professional wrapping dove chocolates.
2269740	2273700	And he goes, these are mushroom and a little marijuana.
2274260	2276780	I'm like, okay, that sounds pretty groovy.
2276780	2281700	Hey, where's the medicine that counteracts the...
2281700	2284860	Steve, bring the ice and such.
2284860	2285860	Okay, now continue.
2285860	2286860	Vodka, please.
2286860	2288140	Just a little advertisement there.
2288140	2289140	I got you.
2289140	2290140	For Brumate.
2290140	2291140	Yeah.
2291140	2292140	Popeye needs a spinach, baby.
2292140	2293500	You've got to fucking have that fuck.
2293500	2296940	This show is tragically brought to you by alcohol.

2334100	2338900	And our promos will be Jeff Davis singing Cabaret.
2338900	2343260	What good is staying alone in your room?
2343260	2344260	That's the finale.
2344260	2345260	That's not the beginning.
2345260	2346260	Is it?
2346260	2349620	Were you tripping out when all the little blonde Nazi boys were walking in a line in
2349620	2350620	the movie?
2350620	2351620	Yeah.
2351620	2352620	Tomorrow belongs to me.
2352620	2353620	That's fucking good.
2353620	2359620	I've never seen Cabaret because if I wanted to take acid, I'd take acid.
2359620	2364580	I see the commercials for it and he's like, well, come, we'll be in for new.
2364580	2367580	And I'm like, no, I won't do it.
2367580	2369020	I'm already scared of life.
2369020	2375980	My parents took me to, I saw that with Joel Gray at the music center or one of the...
2375980	2377940	He goes to see his own shows?
2377940	2378940	You went with him?
2378940	2379940	No, I went to go see.
2379940	2380940	Wow.
2380940	2382340	I went to go see with my parents.
2382340	2384220	I was like six or seven years old.
2384220	2388420	We went to go, because we would go to see everything, big plays that came to LA.
2388420	2398220	And I was sitting there like seven years old, six years old, and it's about Nazis and lesbians
2398220	2399220	and abortions.
2399220	2404180	And I remember looking at my parents like, this really isn't for me.
2404180	2406780	I didn't know what any of it meant.
2406780	2409660	But I remember thinking, the people sitting near me, they're going to be like, there's
2409660	2410660	a kid right here.
2410660	2411660	Yeah.
2411660	2415820	And the way home, I'm in the car, I'm going, two ladies, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
2415820	2418300	It's a song about menage a trois, and my parents were just laughing.
2418300	2419300	I remember that.
2419300	2420300	I had no idea what it was.
2420300	2422780	So anyway, the guy comes in with his chocolates.
2422780	2430700	And I buy the chocolates, and I take the chocolate, and I thought, oh, I didn't like it, because
2430700	2434500	the mushroom thing happens, but then the weed comes in.
2434500	2435500	The edible thing came in.
2435500	2436500	Wait, you were on Acid N?
2436500	2437500	NTHC?
2437500	2438500	No, no, no.
2438500	2439500	This is different.
2439500	2440500	Okay, a different time version.
2441340	2442340	It's not a good story.
2442340	2447040	I tried them twice, and I didn't like them, because the weed part, I'm like you, weed
2447040	2448040	fucks me up.
2448040	2450580	I get way too affected by marijuana.
2450580	2452980	Well, I don't know if it's the people of cannabis.
2452980	2457560	I smoke my fair share of weed, and I get down, but I...
2457560	2458560	You're still cool?
2458560	2460060	Yeah, I'm still cool.
2460060	2461060	You still got it?
2461060	2463540	By the way, I don't want to be distracted by this for the rest of the night, but I can
2463540	2464660	help you with that story.
2464660	2467260	I'm kind of like a Hollywood script doctor.
2467260	2468260	Okay.
2468260	2469260	Whoa.
2470020	2471020	No, no, no.
2471020	2472780	If you want to meet about it, if you want to put something together like I'm Between
2472780	2475700	Projects, I've failed at all the other ones, and so...
2475700	2479620	Okay, this is Dan Harmon, Punches, Jeff's edible story.
2479620	2481700	Oh, I just want to put my hat in the ring, man.
2481700	2482700	Oh.
2482700	2483700	All right.
2483700	2484700	Well, I...
2484700	2485700	You know, look, I don't...
2485700	2488300	I want to work with you on finding the...
2488300	2489300	Okay.
2489300	2491780	Why don't we all kind of bang it out together right now?
2491780	2492780	Yeah.
2492780	2493780	Okay.
2493780	2494780	So, you...
2494780	2495780	And you...
2495780	2496780	Were you finished?
2497780	2502140	Because I didn't want to...
2502140	2503660	I'm not going to interrupt the flow now.
2503660	2504660	No, no, no.
2504660	2510460	And the unspoken part of that is, unlike you, Dan, I'm not a flow interrupter.
2510460	2511460	Dan.
2511460	2517500	Or are you telling me that I'm somehow able to reverse project shaming?
2517500	2524580	Because then I think I'd be a superhero if I could take anything that you said and turn
2524580	2527820	it into me feeling bad about myself.
2527820	2531460	I mean, I'd be out there fighting crime right now.
2531460	2534780	Because who wouldn't want that power?
2534780	2536100	Reverse projecting shame?
2536100	2537500	I can turn...
2537500	2540260	I could find shame in...
2540260	2543060	I've never thought about trying to use it for good.
2543060	2545580	I will find shame in anything.
2545580	2546580	Okay.
2546580	2549300	It's not a challenge.
2549300	2550980	This area rug beneath your feet.
2550980	2554540	It reminds me of the fact that I don't know it.
2554540	2560660	I don't know enough about carpet and the last time I was in an IKEA, I saw a rack of
2560660	2564060	rugs and I was like, maybe I need a rug.
2564060	2569420	And then I was like, I don't know anything about rugs and ran away from the...
2569420	2571420	And I was 25 and I was in an IKEA.
2571420	2574180	That's a time to just grab a rug, man.
2574180	2577340	I fucking missed my life.
2577340	2580620	Because I didn't want to buy a rug wrong.
2580620	2582100	That's fucking sick.
2583100	2590300	What about when my mother told me that I was the only person that mattered to her and she
2590300	2595260	was coming out of a drug trip and we got through it together and we sang and cried together.
2595260	2598020	Oh, you wanted to find shame in that?
2598020	2602460	I thought you looked at me like, this is a wonderful story.
2602460	2603460	I thought you were going to share it.
2603460	2609980	And then my mom turned to me and said, I really wish that you had pursued architecture.
2609980	2617820	And you walked out into the front lawn and you heard a single gunshot and a church bell.
2622780	2623780	There wasn't even a church.
2623780	2625260	Did I ever say it on stage?
2625260	2630820	I think I did say it just the heart of man, we were like the community writer's room.
2630820	2635340	Remember the episode where Abed takes the class taught by the guy who's going to teach
2635340	2637100	you who was the boss?
2637100	2638100	Yeah.
2639100	2646820	I know I've said this publicly before, but probably not a lot, but like we had so much
2646820	2655420	like, Abed finishes with the guy, like he beats him, he figures out who the boss was.
2655420	2660340	And he walks out of the class having bested his teacher.
2660340	2665900	And we really wanted to like have him walking across the quad and you hear like bells, but
2665900	2670140	then you also just hear this single gunshot.
2670140	2673660	There's a shot of Stephen Toblowski in the episode.
2673660	2677700	I have receipts for this because there's a shot of him opening a drawer and looking
2677700	2681380	at what was really happening.
2681380	2682380	We switched that out.
2682380	2686900	That was me and Chris McKenna going like, well, we got to put something in the drawer.
2686900	2689420	It was going to be a gun.
2689420	2690420	And I think there's a gun in the drawer.
2690420	2694220	I think there is a gun, but it's a joke because he like pushes it and then finds the book
2694220	2695220	or something.
2695220	2696220	Okay.
2696220	2697220	He pushes the gun at it.
2697220	2698220	Boy, that wouldn't even fly today.
2698220	2703940	Like guns aren't even funny, like, you know, it's like it wouldn't even be.
2703940	2706420	I think it would have been awesome.
2706420	2710180	But anyway, but we were really like struggling with that.
2710180	2713780	I was like, you can't, like I pitched it and everybody was like, you got to do that with
2713780	2717700	having Abed like walk across the quad and you just hear a single gunshot.
2717700	2723380	The important thing is Abed doesn't turn his head.
2723380	2728540	He stops and pauses and then keeps walking.
2728540	2729540	Does it?
2729540	2730980	Doesn't that happen though?
2730980	2735060	I could, I could be like, there's no gunshot, but doesn't he, I thought maybe I'm just missing
2735060	2738780	memory, but I thought he does like, there's a time where he's walking and then he stops,
2738780	2740300	but there's just, you don't hear a gunshot.
2740300	2741780	Maybe we shot it and we just didn't do it.
2741780	2742780	Yeah.
2742780	2743780	I can't remember.
2743780	2744780	Oh my God.
2744780	2745780	Damn.
2745780	2746780	Yeah.
2746780	2747780	That's my mother shot herself that night.
2747780	2748780	All right.
2748780	2749780	I'm sorry.
2749780	2750780	Sorry.
2750780	2751780	Sorry about that.
2751780	2752780	How can I turn that into shape?
2752780	2755460	I don't have a healthy relationship with my mother.
2755460	2756460	That's easy.
2756460	2759180	Like, oh, how can you take this beautiful thing and turn it into shame?
2759180	2763960	That's a fucking, you turn it upside down.
2763960	2766100	How do you make this smile unhappy?
2766100	2772220	By being a fucking barbarian of shame, by using brute, like happiness inversion.
2772220	2773220	Very simple.
2773220	2774380	Oh, you were happy?
2774380	2776900	Well, I should have been.
2776900	2777900	Done.
2777900	2779860	Oh, that rainbow's pretty.
2779860	2781740	I'm not.
2781740	2783500	That's shame 101.
2783500	2789420	I mean, fucking, I want to say challenge me, but I'm afraid you'll challenge me and I'll
2789420	2793700	look like a horrible person because I should look like that.
2793700	2794860	I'm a monster.
2794860	2795860	Okay.
2795860	2797580	What about the moon landing?
2797580	2800860	I feel bad that the podcast isn't about going to the moon anymore.
2800860	2801860	Nice.
2801860	2802860	Wow.
2802860	2803860	Master.
2803860	2805420	I didn't realize I threw you a lob on that one.
2805420	2808700	We had something go in there and you did what you always do, Dan.
2808700	2809700	We did that for like-
2809700	2810700	You fucked it up.
2810700	2811700	You fucked it up.
2812140	2813820	You can't just leave well enough alone.
2813820	2814820	You got to overthink.
2814820	2815820	You got to change.
2815820	2816820	You got to evolve.
2816820	2820620	You're just like, it's just you're a moving target with a gun to your head.
2820620	2821620	No one cares.
2821620	2823620	Stop moving.
2823620	2826020	Or put the gun down.
2826020	2834580	So Gabe, what streaming media do you think that with no more Nielsen's, like how will
2834580	2836100	we reach the youth?
2836100	2844940	Oh, wait, I do have a point about that.
2844940	2847700	The service that we're on, does anybody here have Pluto TV?
2847700	2848700	Pluto TV.
2848700	2849700	All right.
2849700	2850700	There we go.
2850700	2851700	One guy.
2851700	2852700	One guy who may be lying.
2852700	2853700	No offense.
2853700	2860140	If he is, well, anyways, continue please.
2860140	2863460	If you're in Los Angeles or New York and you're listening to this right now, they're doing
2863460	2867860	like this huge press push for it of like just ads everywhere and it's like free TV
2867860	2874500	and it's like the next generation of entertainment and you go on it and it looks just like cable.
2874500	2878860	You scan through and it's got commercials and so it's like, oh, that's the system is
2878860	2880660	like commercials.
2880660	2883060	It's free TV because you've got commercials.
2883060	2887820	So I think that's the next step is like just cycling back to where we were.
2887820	2888820	We used to call that TV.
2888820	2889820	Right.
2889820	2890820	Right.
2890820	2891820	Right.
2891820	2892820	Right.
2892980	2893980	Yeah.
2893980	2899900	Well, it would only be like the old days if the media providers somehow merged until there
2899900	2902900	were only three of them.
2902900	2907060	That's never going to happen because the internet.
2907060	2908860	Is it all original content or is that good?
2908860	2910100	No, it's like a good mix.
2910100	2913660	You can watch like America's Most Wanted and then you can go see like an Inuartu film.
2913660	2915500	Like they've got like a pretty interesting.
2915500	2920140	They got like a pretty interesting line of things and channels are like, you know, weed
2920140	2922940	or slow motion or like animals or whatever.
2922940	2925340	Like it's more like way matically like motion.
2925340	2926340	Yeah.
2926340	2927340	There's a there's a slow.
2927340	2929140	There's a it's called slow.
2929140	2932580	Like so like kind of satisfying kind of videos or.
2932580	2933580	Yeah.
2933580	2934580	Yeah.
2934580	2935580	Yeah.
2935580	2936580	That's awesome.
2936580	2937580	That means no.
2937580	2941580	I don't work for this company.
2941580	2947780	I can't, I could have pitched that way better if I, you know, you look, I mean now I either
2947780	2949860	want to watch it or I'm never going to.
2949860	2951380	I want to watch it really high.
2951380	2953980	You were like the commercials are slow.
2953980	2958100	You were painted in a corner there on your advocacy of slow.
2958100	2959100	It just seems cool.
2959100	2960100	I don't know.
2960100	2961100	No, it's cool.
2961100	2962100	And they got supermarket sweepstakes.
2962100	2963100	That's good.
2963100	2964100	I like.
2964100	2965100	Oh yeah.
2965100	2966100	Yeah.
2966100	2967100	Yeah.
2967100	2968100	Yeah.
2968100	2969100	They got good stuff.
2969100	2970100	Oh yes.
2970100	2971100	See, I want a trip to Rome with Matt Gurley on shop to your drop and everyone's everyone
2971100	2972100	confuses it with supermarket sweep.
2972100	2973100	And we know.
2973100	2974100	No.
2974100	2975100	Yeah.
2975100	2976100	Yeah.
2976100	2977100	She's living.
2977100	2978100	What are you guessing about?
2978100	2979100	She's excited.
2979340	2980660	You're going to love dope state.
2980660	2983100	It's nothing like either one of them.
2983100	2988860	It was shot 20 years later and yeah, she had both of her hands on the air freaking out
2988860	2989860	about shop to your drop.
2989860	2990860	Yeah.
2990860	2991860	You were, I mean you, you hit her.
2991860	2993220	It was like a one, two, two.
2993220	2994220	I heard her individual.
2994220	2995220	She went, yes.
2995220	3000260	And then that was like a step up and then it was like, I got it.
3000260	3003860	Like, I mean, I got it when you said after, yes.
3003860	3004860	And then she was like, yes.
3004860	3005860	Right.
3005860	3008460	Like, why is he talking about both of them?
3009460	3013180	Cause I mean, it makes sense that you'd maybe be a connoisseur, right?
3013180	3014180	Of like shopping.
3014180	3015180	Like these two things.
3015180	3018620	They ran back to back so you'd watch the whole hour, right?
3018620	3019620	Yeah.
3019620	3020620	Yeah.
3020620	3021620	All right.
3021620	3022620	Me and my friend Matt.
3022620	3023620	I'm going to interview you.
3023620	3028060	I'm like, what's your, what do you like so much about shopping carts?
3028060	3031220	What drugs do your mom do?
3031220	3033460	Bring her up on stage.
3033460	3035540	Come up on stage shopping person.
3035540	3040500	If you'd like to come up, you can, but you know, you don't have to if you don't want
3040500	3041500	to.
3044500	3045500	Danielle, everybody.
3045500	3048500	Danielle, have a seat.
3048500	3050500	Oh God.
3050500	3051500	You don't have to stay up here, Danielle.
3051500	3052500	I just thought it'd be funny.
3052500	3053500	All right.
3053500	3054500	Okay.
3054500	3056860	Jeff leans, leans toward bringing people up.
3056860	3060700	He's like, he's, he's, he knows it can lead to magic.
3060700	3063780	What show brought you here that you spent two years of your life making?
3063780	3065580	How did you earn your way to this?
3065580	3067820	How did you earn your way to this stage?
3067820	3074860	Listen, I actually work for a supermarket.
3074860	3076100	So both of those shows.
3076100	3077100	Do you sweep?
3077100	3078260	I sweep so hard.
3078260	3079260	Hell yeah.
3079260	3081700	What's, what's your title at the supermarket if I can ask?
3081700	3083220	I'm a human resource manager.
3083220	3084220	Whoa.
3084220	3087660	So you're the, you're in charge of all the employees, like, like they, whether they have
3087660	3088660	complete, it's HR.
3088660	3089660	What am I doing?
3089660	3090660	Human resources.
3090660	3091660	Yeah.
3091660	3092660	And so it's like, like they have complaints.
3092660	3093660	Oh, I hate it.
3094180	3095180	You don't have to come down on them though.
3095180	3097100	Like if they're not working hard enough, or do you just.
3097100	3098100	Yeah.
3098100	3099100	You're who they send in when they get fired, right?
3099100	3100100	You're, you're the fire person.
3100100	3101100	Yeah.
3101100	3102100	I'm the hiring and firing person.
3102100	3104540	So I hire them and then fire them.
3104540	3108580	How do you fire someone without sucking your thumb and, and throwing a tantrum?
3108580	3110420	Oh no, the, the store manager actually does it.
3110420	3112420	So I just sit there and just yes him.
3112420	3113420	Ah.
3113420	3114420	Just make sure he says it better.
3114420	3115420	Yeah.
3115420	3116420	This guy knows.
3116420	3117580	Make sure he's PC about it.
3117580	3123580	When they fire someone at this establishment, uh, did they, is it like, is there a rich
3123580	3124580	ritual to it?
3124580	3125580	Oh yeah.
3125580	3126580	Yeah.
3126580	3129660	You got to, you have to, you have to make sure it's legit reason.
3129660	3130660	Right.
3130660	3131660	Cause they could sue, right?
3131660	3132660	Yeah.
3132660	3133660	Oh yeah.
3133660	3134660	Oh, there's that.
3134660	3135660	Yeah.
3135660	3136660	Good point, Jeff.
3136660	3137660	It's horrible.
3137660	3138660	I don't know where I'm looking.
3138660	3139660	Sorry.
3139660	3140660	No, no, no.
3140660	3141660	People do that all the time.
3141660	3142820	I've accepted it as a dynamic of the stage.
3142820	3143820	It's no one's fault.
3143820	3144820	I'm just hearing things.
3144820	3145820	No, you're doing great.
3145820	3146820	You're doing great.
3146820	3150260	But it's gotta be like, by the, like I was fired from Baskin Robbins, Togo's Baskin Robbins
3150260	3152940	because I was, I was taking too many samples for myself.
3152940	3156220	So I stole, I stole ice cream or whatever.
3156220	3157220	Yes.
3157220	3160700	And so like, does it ever feel like you're being pushed to like put someone in a box?
3160700	3163700	Like, oh, they're not allowed to do this specific thing.
3163700	3164900	So they were like doing it.
3164900	3166620	Like, you know, it has to be by the book, right?
3166620	3168140	Do you ever like put people in that book?
3168140	3169140	No, no, no, no, no.
3169140	3170300	I mean, why would you admit to that?
3170300	3171300	I suppose.
3171300	3172980	You know what I find interesting though?
3172980	3177320	Cause they like, Sony would send a lawyer every year on a Sony show.
3177320	3181420	They send a lawyer to like give you a talk about like what's constitutional and what's
3181420	3182420	not and stuff.
3182780	3185620	It's weird cause it's coming from their perspective cause it's like about what's going to protect
3185620	3189060	them cause you don't sue any higher than them.
3189060	3192900	So if someone sues me and then they, but there's not, it's not worth it, blah, blah, blah.
3192900	3199540	So Sony has this vested interest in like explaining what, when it's okay to fire someone
3199540	3204840	and when it's not, what I find fascinating is like, of course you can't fire someone
3204840	3212020	because of the, of this whole list of constitutionally protected attributes, but you, you can fire
3212020	3214860	someone because you don't like the look of their face.
3214860	3217580	Like you, you, you just have to specify, right?
3217580	3219580	You just have to be like, yeah, I don't, I don't like them.
3219580	3223100	I don't like their personality and I, I, isn't that true?
3223100	3226380	Like it's, you don't need like a good reason to fire someone.
3226380	3229220	There's just like a category of reasons that are illegal.
3229220	3239780	We only fire someone if they're stealing or stealing, that's the two things.
3239780	3245660	So if somebody's fucking on the apples, they're stealing hygiene.
3245660	3250260	If a customer complains enough, we have to let them go.
3250260	3251260	So Dan's incorrect.
3251260	3254660	You can't fire someone cause you don't like the look of their face, which is based on
3254660	3255660	what?
3255660	3257660	Like, where did you get that idea that that's a thing?
3257660	3262140	I thought that was the message I got from, yeah, that's what they say.
3262140	3265260	They're like, because they walk you through these scenarios where they're like, uh, so
3265260	3272420	and so wants to fire so and so, um, but it was sort of like, like what they didn't say,
3272420	3274500	here's what you say if you want to fire them.
3274500	3278580	But they're kind of like, is this guy firing her for, you know, I was like, why are there
3278580	3279580	genders known?
3279580	3280580	No.
3280580	3287140	Um, there's no women at this meeting about how to fire women.
3287140	3290380	Is weed one of the things that you can fire people from if they like, if they smoke weed?
3290380	3297140	Um, so we can't accuse someone of being intoxicated or high, but if we smell and then we can be
3297140	3300340	like, Hey, like what's, if they admit to it, then we can fire them.
3300340	3303100	Oh, I dodged a bullet.
3303100	3311100	No, but technically, technically beard a man with a hat, getting mad about the week.
3311100	3313780	If you, it's the same thing as being intoxicated at work.
3313780	3317820	If you are high or intoxicated and you admit to it, then we can fire you.
3318260	3320300	Do you ever, do you ever like, Hey, be real with me.
3320300	3329900	No, you know, I'm like, listen, listen, David, I'll take my, take my HR hat off and then
3329900	3335420	like, yeah, I did a J in the parking lot just to be cool.
3335420	3339180	And you're like, well, two things you need to know, that's not cool.
3339180	3347620	And the hats always on, you're, you're out of here fucking pot face with your head.
3347620	3349700	I don't know your drug terms.
3349700	3350700	Danielle.
3350700	3354380	So if someone, like, if you, someone comes in and their eyes are glassy and red and they
3354380	3359060	smell like weed and you go, excuse me, are you intoxicated on the marijuana's?
3359060	3361940	And they go, no, man.
3361940	3362940	I can't do nothing.
3362940	3363940	I can't, I can't do anything.
3363940	3364940	Really?
3364940	3365940	That's awesome.
3365940	3366940	I love that.
3366940	3372860	I auditioned for a job at a children's museum exhibit with Sean McKenna.
3372860	3374660	I don't think I've ever told this story.
3374660	3375940	That's why I'm excited.
3375940	3378980	Because I'm like, wow, that's, that's one I don't think I've ever told because I'm so
3378980	3385860	deeply ashamed of it that I went with, you know, I am to do an improv troops and I'm
3385860	3390580	just like living the life of like, I use most of my paycheck to buy weed and I'm just, and
3390580	3396100	then buy gas to get to do more shows and I'm just kind of living the fucking pre panic
3396100	3397180	attack life.
3397180	3398580	It's great.
3398580	3405460	And and I like, damn it, hurry up and remember why you interrupted everyone and tell your
3405460	3407420	fucking thing.
3407420	3414820	I like, like my, my, my buddy Sean was like, I mean, we were, that was, I was his roommate.
3414820	3419580	I lived in his attic when I was at the peak of that phase and I was like, he and I were
3419580	3424660	like in the kind of category of like, well, they, you can have lots of shows because you're
3424660	3429340	the only ones guaranteed to be home when we call, like everyone else is like trying to
3429340	3430980	be an adult.
3430980	3436340	So like you guys are like really dedicated to improv and in air quotes, meaning you're
3436340	3441060	like, you're fucking on the couch straight up and like, um, I think that he and I never
3441060	3446620	talked about it, but, uh, afterward, because I think we both really didn't, we didn't want
3446620	3451740	to face this, but like we, I remember we got this opportunity through some mutual friends
3451740	3452740	of ours.
3452740	3456180	So like, they're like, Hey, they're adding this thing at the museum and the children's
3456180	3457180	wing.
3457180	3462220	Like they want to do these like, um, uh, uh, uh, fucking what's his name, boat to bill
3462220	3467300	nine kind of things, like based on the popularity at that time of like, Hey, science is cool.
3467300	3468860	And they want to add like live shows.
3468860	3472740	You'd do like a beakman thing or something at this thing and it was like, Oh, this'll
3472740	3473740	be cool.
3473740	3476980	And they're like, they're having open auditions and me and Sean went in and we had, we talked
3476980	3480300	about it for a while and we were like, well, let's do this and that.
3480300	3484100	We came up with an audition and we went in and we're like, boy, this, I was thinking in
3484100	3486460	my head, like, like, like, you never know.
3486460	3489620	You never know which of these little stepping stones is going to be the thing you look back
3489620	3490620	on.
3490620	3492340	You go, well, I used to just play resident evil.
3492340	3497580	And then like all of a sudden I bought my first tie, um, and that there, you don't know
3497580	3499500	what's, what's that, what's that thing that's going to happen?
3499500	3502900	And it just felt like it might be one of those, which makes me sound square.
3502900	3507980	Cause it makes me sound like my ambition was to get a tie, like grow up.
3507980	3512740	And I, I remember like we did our thing and the, there were like four people in this like
3512740	3517780	auditorium watching and I knew three of them because there it's, I was like, yeah,
3517780	3522180	but this is like, it's Milwaukee and, but this is how you move forward and it's like,
3522180	3523180	I'm ready.
3523180	3524180	Let's do this.
3524180	3525780	And like, like, here's what I do.
3525780	3527700	It's just like, it's an audition.
3527700	3532260	There'll be a script like this is our style and Sean and I played off each other and we,
3532260	3533260	all right, well thank you.
3533260	3534260	All right.
3534260	3535260	See you later.
3535260	3536260	We went home like a day later.
3536260	3541540	One of the people that worked at the museum was like, Hey, you guys, like, uh, uh, your
3541540	3543100	audition was great.
3543100	3544100	Like they loved you guys.
3544100	3545100	That was amazing.
3545100	3547860	Is that you guys, that you guys are so funny.
3547860	3556060	Um, you reeked so bad of marijuana and booze, like, like it was just coming off of you.
3556060	3563540	There was just a cloud of pot and booze around you everywhere you went and everyone was like,
3563540	3570420	could smell it and was all like, how hilarious is this that they're auditioning to teach
3570420	3578820	children science and they smell like a fucking child ruiner.
3578820	3583740	And we're, and I remember Sean and I like both just laughing about it going, I guess
3583740	3589420	we did smell like weed and that's why the system's not ready for us.
3589420	3593180	But I can't speak for him, but I died a little inside.
3593180	3598300	Like, I was like, you, that was probably your last chance ever to do anything with your
3598300	3599300	life.
3599300	3600300	All right.
3600300	3601300	Anyways.
3601300	3602300	So how, uh, all right.
3602300	3603740	Well, I have a question for Daniel.
3603740	3604740	Okay.
3604740	3610220	Um, so you're in the room for these firings, uh, like how, how ugly has it gotten?
3610220	3613180	Do people like throw stuff and freak out?
3613180	3616460	People usually just admit to it and they're like, all right, see you later stealing.
3616460	3617460	They admit to stealing.
3617460	3618460	Oh, always.
3618460	3619460	They're like, yeah, I did it.
3619460	3623420	Or even don't they understand that's what you want them to do so you can get the power
3623420	3624420	to fire them.
3624420	3625420	Yeah.
3625420	3629220	And they don't, they don't understand the concept of like, if you admit to it, you can't
3629220	3630980	claim unemployment or do anything.
3630980	3631980	Cause you admitted to it.
3631980	3635420	I mean, so I always get the emails from the lawyers being like, Hey, why'd you fire this
3635420	3636420	person?
3636420	3640260	Like they admitted to stealing or they admitted to being drunk or high and they don't get
3640260	3642780	like, I don't understand why I didn't get unemployment.
3642780	3646740	Um, because you admitted to just doing all these wrong things.
3646740	3650220	God, are you saying I could have gotten employment from my Togo's Baskin Robbins job?
3650220	3651220	Yes.
3651220	3657160	Only if you were a liar, man, you needed to be a more dishonest person in the fiber of
3657160	3658160	your being.
3658160	3661600	If you ever get called in, just deny everything.
3661600	3662600	Yeah.
3662600	3665120	And I'm best friends with my loss prevention guy.
3665120	3668240	So he always tells me like, if you ever get caught, just deny it.
3668240	3669240	Damn.
3669240	3672480	I feel like I'm going to be able to work with you to steal some TVs pretty soon.
3672480	3673480	Yeah.
3673480	3679320	They give you a physicals for insurance when you're going to be involved in a TV production
3679320	3684240	and everyone is like, don't, yeah, don't tell them the truth.
3684240	3688120	I, I, I, I said, everyone's like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they're
3688160	3691480	they're like, it's not, I know you got that story about it.
3691480	3693320	It's like, it's like, it's like the, they're mad at you.
3693320	3696000	If you tell the truth, you're going to cause everybody a bunch of trouble.
3696000	3699120	I think that's why I never worked for that, for that company again.
3699120	3705240	Like I think I had a black mark on me for just saying, you mean to tell me, like, look
3705240	3709720	at our cast, nobody here has ever smoked a joint.
3709720	3710720	Like no one here.
3710720	3711720	Like, come on now.
3711720	3716760	I mean, it is, it is, it is crazy to me, but that's, that's our society.
3716760	3719680	So they just like bald face lies when everyone knows you're lying.
3719680	3720680	That just works now.
3720680	3721680	It's fine.
3721680	3722680	You didn't know you're supposed to lie.
3722680	3727640	It is really crazy to me when I, when I, maybe I've talked about this when I was a big shoplifter
3727640	3731720	in like college, I used to steal anything just for no reason.
3731720	3736640	And I, I stole books a lot from Barnes and Noble or, or, or, uh, another company.
3736640	3740000	It could have been, it could have been any company walled in books.
3740000	3742040	I just, you know, I just said, forget it was borders.
3742040	3743040	It was borders.
3743920	3746800	Because boards was around when I was in college and no, it wasn't.
3746800	3751560	Uh, at any rate, a friend of mine used to work there and he said, if you, if you steal
3751560	3755560	anything, even if they think or know that you're walking out of the store with something,
3755560	3756960	we are not allowed to follow you.
3756960	3757960	Yeah.
3757960	3759600	They could call the cops and the cops don't know who you are.
3759600	3760600	You're just gone.
3760600	3761600	Yeah.
3761600	3762600	And the cops don't care.
3762600	3763600	Wait.
3763600	3764600	Say that again.
3764600	3770040	If you, you could, you could like pick up a stack of books off the shelf and go taking
3770040	3772520	these and walk out of the store.
3772520	3773760	They are not allowed to come out and get you.
3773760	3774760	They can't touch you either.
3774760	3775760	It's true.
3775760	3776760	You're kidding.
3776760	3777760	It's true.
3777760	3780600	This is like kind of almost the opposite of what I was thinking would be the case.
3780600	3784240	That they can't do anything to you in the store and they have to wait for you to leave
3784240	3785600	at which point they'll tackle you.
3785600	3788680	And I bet I learned that from a fucking movie they used to terrorize students.
3788680	3789680	No.
3789680	3793920	So once you leave the store, loss prevention, go out and confront you.
3793920	3798400	And if you say no, they can't touch you, they can't make you come back in the store and
3798400	3799400	that's it.
3799400	3802160	You can be like, okay, I'm calling the cops and they're like, all right, see you later.
3802160	3803160	Right.
3803160	3804160	That's it.
3804160	3809240	I used to, I used to, I went through a shoplifting phase when I was like 22 and I, I got really
3809240	3814560	into going to the Gelsons in Tarzana and I would walk in and I would go to the little
3814560	3817640	cookie area, like the cookies and treats, right?
3817640	3818840	I'd like buy a nice tea.
3818840	3823600	So I bought something and then I'd go and get like baguettes and sushi and butternut
3823600	3829080	squash soup and I'd put it in the bag and I'd come sit with the, these like old war
3829080	3832440	veterans that used to hang out at the Gelsons in Tarzana at lunch.
3832440	3836420	And I like, I don't know, I was getting off on something, you know, like making up stories
3836420	3837420	like that.
3837420	3840680	I told them my name was something else and like I would sit there and eat and uh, my
3840680	3841680	name is Jean-Claude.
3841680	3842680	Yeah.
3842680	3846680	I was just like lost in the valley and needed something in my day to do that.
3846680	3850880	And uh, and, and uh, and one time they brought and I did it for like a couple of weeks and
3850880	3852280	it became like a thing.
3852280	3858320	And then Gelsons got an undercover guy and I was sitting there eating my sushi and cops
3858320	3863520	rolled up on me and arrested me in front of my war veteran friends who were like, they
3863520	3866440	pick me up and they're like, what did, what did young Dylan do?
3866440	3869040	You know, it was like, he served this country.
3869040	3872000	It was because I stole over $30 worth of stuff.
3872000	3876600	So it was an arrestable offense and uh, and yeah, and they, and they like hauled me away
3876600	3879680	to the Van Nuys jail, which is like one of the worst.
3879680	3880680	Oh no.
3880680	3881680	It was, it was awful.
3881680	3886520	And I was in the cop car and I was being a little dick that the cop was like, so why
3886520	3887520	did you do this?
3887520	3889840	I was like, well, you know, I thought it'd be interesting to, you know, I'm writing something
3889840	3893200	right now where somebody gets arrested and just, you know, I'd be interested for it.
3893200	3897200	Just playing that cop angle, like, you know, the cops gonna fucking love it.
3897200	3900280	Oh, I got a Hollywood guy in the back seat.
3900280	3901720	I love those.
3901720	3903800	That's why I became a cop.
3903800	3909600	He drops me off at Van Nuys jail and immediately I understood what the repercussions, like
3909600	3911680	I thought, they didn't tell me I was going to jail.
3911680	3915160	They thought, I thought I was going to get like booked at the thing and they'd write
3915160	3919600	me a thing and he drops me off at the jail and the last thing I turned back to him and
3919600	3922800	he's like, uh, good luck with that little research project there, buddy.
3922800	3932880	And like, he like does a finger gun right in the leg and I go down and pull a tourniquet
3932880	3933880	together.
3933880	3934880	Yeah.
3934880	3936200	Uh, but it was there.
3936200	3938800	They dropped me off on a Friday.
3938800	3943360	So I'm in there and the lady at the thing is she's like, so what, you know, and I'm
3943360	3944360	like, how long am I going to be here?
3944360	3946360	She was like, well, it's Friday at the end of the day.
3946360	3949360	So Saturday, Sunday, Monday is Martin Luther King day.
3949360	3952920	So yeah, around like probably Tuesday, Wednesday.
3952920	3957160	And I think I started crying and then, uh, and then they somehow got me out.
3957160	3958160	Wait, what?
3958160	3959160	Yeah.
3959160	3966660	What in the privilege here's exactly what the lady said to me.
3966660	3967660	She walked by me.
3967660	3968660	I was standing at.
3968660	3974440	The last just, um, TV and they're like sports and shit, which for my little queer heart
3974440	3980720	was like, and, uh, and, and she was, the lady walked by, she was like, you don't look like
3980720	3981720	you belong here.
3981720	3982720	And she's like, what's your deal?
3982720	3989820	I was like, I stole it back yet with the butternut squash soup with a lovely hint of lemon French
3989820	3992060	and I don't know why I'm here.
3992060	3996080	And uh, and they let, and they, and yeah, and they let me out and I stole the, I stole the
3996080	4003860	jail pants and that was the last thing I ever stole now, my mom's a drug dealer.
4003860	4009340	I want to, I want to bookend that with my mom does not want people to know that she
4009340	4012140	was doing, it was like, nobody tell Gabe's mom.
4012140	4013140	Okay.
4013140	4015080	I'm trying to make that like, okay.
4015080	4018300	You know, it's like, it's fucking like Marin County.
4018300	4019700	Like I don't think there could be anything wrong.
4019700	4020700	Like everybody's growing it.
4020700	4021700	All right.
4021700	4022700	I'm okay.
4022700	4027720	I, I used to go into a soup plantation and you guys are going to do a soup plantation.
4027720	4041040	She had supermarket sweep energy about soup, but I, I, I, I, I, I bring them up, uh, yeah,
4041040	4042040	come on up here.
4042040	4043040	Come on.
4043040	4044040	Now get out.
4044040	4045040	Yeah.
4045040	4046040	All right.
4046040	4047040	This is the exuberant hour.
4047040	4048040	Hello.
4048040	4049040	What's your name?
4049040	4050040	Oh, God.
4050040	4051040	It's Nova.
4051040	4053180	Nova's back everybody.
4053180	4054180	Soup plantation.
4054180	4055180	I got Nova.
4055180	4056420	I love a soup plantation.
4056420	4057420	All right.
4057420	4062660	When you go into a soup plantation, if you're not hip to the jive, you walk in, uh, you,
4062660	4063860	it starts with a salad bar.
4063860	4067260	Then at the end of that salad bar, you bring your tray and your plate up to a cash register
4067260	4072480	and then beyond the cash register after you've paid, it's, it's also, it's hot stuff and cookies
4072480	4078860	and brownies and soups and uh, plantations and uh, yes, you can grow some cotton.
4078860	4082480	I didn't know that you can go back to get more salad after you've sat down and stuff.
4082480	4083480	Yeah.
4083480	4085480	So I was broke.
4085480	4086480	I was in college.
4086480	4090680	I was still in my shoplifting, stealing days and like I went to USC and stole just everything
4090680	4093240	and from the, from the commissary there or what do you call it?
4093240	4098360	The place with the food and uh, what I would do is I'd walk in without a plate.
4098360	4102600	I would walk past the cash register as I didn't have a plate and I would just say, I, I just
4102600	4105360	kind of looked like I just kind of do like a point, like I'm meeting a friend or whatever.
4105360	4106360	Like I'm not eating.
4106360	4108440	I'm just coming in to sit with a pal or whatever.
4108440	4112280	And they didn't, if you, if you didn't have the, the iconic tray with the salad on it,
4112280	4113820	they didn't care about you.
4113820	4117380	So I would just go in there and I would find a table that somebody had left and there were
4117380	4120540	still plates on and I would just sit there and read.
4120540	4123300	And then after five minutes, I looked like the guy and they would, they come over and
4123300	4126380	they'd clear the thing and they go, Hey, was that ice tea?
4126380	4128380	I go, yeah, but I've had enough ice tea.
4128380	4131980	Okay, let's get some water and they go, okay, um, uh, yeah, get a new plate, walk, I'll
4131980	4132980	clear these for you.
4132980	4137900	Slowly merge into the endless cycle that is the soup plantation lifestyle.
4137900	4140320	And so then I would go up there and eat like crazy.
4140320	4143440	And then, uh, I will get, they go, do you want anything to go, but we just made a fresh
4143440	4144440	batch of pizzas.
4144440	4145440	I'm like, yeah.
4145440	4146440	And then they'd wrap up pizza and foil.
4146440	4149980	So I would go there two, three times a week and I kept doing it.
4149980	4154240	And once you get past the cash register, all the servers and bus people and the people
4154240	4158440	that are serving the food and whatnot, they, they don't care.
4158440	4161520	They assumed that you paid because you wouldn't be able to be there.
4161520	4166600	I went there so often they knew my name and they would like, Hey, Jeff, what's up, man?
4166600	4170340	Like we just made a batch of brownies, but we already wrapped them up for you.
4170340	4175620	It's like, it's like a fucking Tom Hanks movie from like their early thousands.
4175620	4179700	I social engineered plantation, like you're just stuck there because you don't have a
4179700	4180700	green card.
4180700	4184580	But I actually, you, you, you helped deliver a baby at one point.
4184580	4187580	I actually, I stopped going because I felt bad because they liked me there.
4187580	4189060	I didn't, I didn't want them to be friends.
4189060	4190060	Yeah.
4190060	4193660	It ends with like the CIA has got soup plantations surrounded and then, but then every waiter
4193660	4200160	like gives you, uh, uh, the punches, your soup card.
4200160	4204280	The only time I got caught stealing and I stole a lot, uh, was at our supermarket at
4204280	4209960	a Ralph's and I stole, we were going to the beach and I stole like a $2 thing of like
4209960	4212320	a little pack of salami and cheese.
4212320	4216640	And I just did a little turnaround and tuck it in my shorts like I always did.
4216640	4222600	And I hand grabs me and it's just a dude that was shopping there and he goes, I saw you
4222600	4223600	do that.
4223600	4227780	And he, and he, and he drags me or he gets, oh no, he, he, he doesn't grab me by the arm
4227780	4228780	yet.
4228780	4233740	He goes and comes with the manager at me and I'm apprehended and they go, we saw you steal
4233740	4234740	that.
4234740	4235740	I'm like, what?
4235740	4237920	And they dragged me off to the back room, to the office.
4237920	4242100	And I'm just in like shorts and a t-shirt and sandals or whatever that we're all going
4242100	4243100	to the beach.
4243100	4244580	I believe I had dreadlocks at this time.
4244580	4245580	Hell yeah.
4245580	4246580	Yeah.
4246580	4247580	Cause that was fucking awesome.
4247580	4248580	Cactus bunch.
4248580	4249580	Um, is that a real thing?
4249580	4250580	Did you have dreadlocks?
4250580	4251580	Oh yeah.
4252580	4253880	I want to play you in a show.
4253880	4254880	That sounds hilarious.
4254880	4255880	Yes.
4255880	4256880	Yeah.
4256880	4257880	So, uh, yeah.
4257880	4258880	So I was a good kid.
4258880	4259880	I get good grades.
4259880	4264680	Uh, so I'm sitting in the, in the manager's office and the cop, he's an off duty cop,
4264680	4265680	the guy.
4265680	4267440	I thought he was just some vigilante guy.
4267440	4268440	He's an off duty.
4268440	4269600	Oh, what are your PD officer?
4269600	4271200	And he is fucking furious.
4271200	4272200	It's Saturday afternoon.
4272200	4275880	He's got nothing to do except harangue me and he's like, you're going down to the fucking
4275880	4276880	station buddy.
4276880	4279280	Like, like, I saw you do that and I'm looking, I'm sitting there.
4279280	4281480	I got a cop yelling at me and the manager is like, okay, yeah.
4281480	4282480	We got it.
4282480	4283480	We got to do something about this.
4283480	4287620	Uh, and there's the little thing of $2 salami and cheese on the desk and I'm like, fuck.
4287620	4291100	And the guy's yelling at me and I said, like, like, we're, we're, we're going to arrest
4291100	4292100	you for this.
4292100	4295180	And I said, here's the, here's the thing officer, fuck face.
4295180	4296180	I didn't say that.
4296180	4299140	Uh, I said, uh, I didn't leave the store.
4299140	4301500	There's no, no crime has been committed.
4301500	4304500	You're allowed to put salami in your pocket theoretically.
4304500	4307460	I'm not aware of the law in the book that says I can't put your salami and cheese down
4307460	4308460	my shorts.
4308460	4311560	Uh, I said, it's gross and I shouldn't do that just to be a nice person.
4311560	4315240	But I said, I haven't, if you waited until I'd walked out with it, then you have a thing
4315240	4317880	and he goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, and he goes, show me your ID.
4317880	4319360	And he goes, how much money do you have on you?
4319360	4320360	So I don't have any money.
4320360	4321360	He goes, well enough burglary.
4321360	4324440	You came in without the intent to pay and you put it in your face.
4324440	4326680	I said, no, I didn't commit a crime.
4326680	4328240	I haven't left the store.
4328240	4329240	Wow.
4329240	4334880	That was a weird fucking, that burglary thing was hummingbird like in its beak shape.
4334880	4338200	It was like, did they improvise that?
4338260	4342880	I was, I knew a lot of the shoplifting kind of, no, but that was their counter, right?
4342880	4345060	They said, you don't have any money.
4345060	4351540	And so your burglar, I said, I said, if you want to arrest me, and since you're off duty,
4351540	4354920	it's a Saturday afternoon and I don't think you're going to get any of your buddies to
4354920	4360060	come down here and pick a 17 year old up for $2 of salami and cheese in his shorts.
4360060	4363540	I said, call, get them on the phone and see if you can get someone down here right now.
4363540	4366980	And the guy's like, well, we were there for a long time.
4366980	4370040	And so he goes, and my friends are waiting in the parking lot, I have no idea what's
4370040	4371040	going on.
4371040	4375520	And he goes, well, we got to call your dad then we got to call your parents.
4375520	4376520	Let's call your mom.
4376520	4377520	So my mom passed away.
4377520	4383560	Oh, oh yeah, it was a fucking street fight at this point.
4383560	4386960	He's gonna look, you punched him into a trash can.
4386960	4387960	It has a lid.
4387960	4390600	They work like Frisbees.
4390600	4391600	His hands are tied.
4391600	4392600	Yeah.
4392600	4394320	So he's gonna call your dad that my dad was working.
4394320	4396960	My dad would not have been fucking happy about this, obviously.
4396960	4398740	If they're counter, then we'll call your dad.
4398740	4401060	Yeah, I said, I said, my dad's at work.
4401060	4402980	He goes, where does he work?
4402980	4405460	And I said, I told him the name of the, no, I didn't tell him the name of the place.
4405460	4407340	I said, he goes, what's the phone number?
4407340	4410220	And I made up a phone number and just pray to God.
4410220	4413660	This is back in the days where not everybody had an answering machine and not everybody
4413660	4415940	had, you know, there was no cell phones and shit.
4415940	4416940	Phones weren't people.
4416940	4417940	Yeah, exactly.
4417940	4419940	They were devices that were left at home.
4419940	4424740	And if you went out for a haircut, you might miss a job.
4424740	4429180	And so they called the number, thank God nobody answers and he goes, we got to release
4429180	4430180	you to somebody.
4430180	4432720	I said, well, you could call my brother, but I'm not giving you his number.
4432720	4434600	And they're like, why?
4434600	4435600	Because he's Dracula.
4435600	4443040	And you're like, I could have done that at any time, but I said, no, my brother fucking
4443040	4451480	will, he will, he will beat the shit out of me in front of you.
4451480	4454100	My brother will kick the ever loving shit out of me.
4454100	4457900	I'm not, I take me to fucking jail that I'm not doing that.
4457900	4461840	And he's like, oh, the cop fucking fell for it.
4461840	4463820	My brother and I love each other.
4463820	4469100	And he's like, oh, give us a number.
4469100	4472940	And so we called it, Bill was at home and he goes, we got your brother here.
4472940	4476580	He got caught stealing at the Ralph's on a beach Boulevard.
4476580	4479380	And so my brother comes in and he's a little miffed.
4479380	4480380	It was Saturday.
4480380	4481920	He had his own stuff to do.
4481920	4484280	And he comes in and he sees me sitting there in my shorts and there's a little thing of
4484280	4486080	salami and cheese in the desk.
4486080	4490280	And he goes, is that what I think it is?
4490280	4498040	He takes the whole, the whole tableau in and I get up and I go, hey, man, and he goes,
4498040	4499040	you fucking asshole.
4499040	4504040	And we just fucking laugh and we hug and we walk and I go, bye, guys.
4504040	4505040	Nice.
4505040	4513260	You were, you were 17, didn't you say, I thought I heard you were 17.
4513260	4514260	16 or 17.
4514260	4515260	Okay.
4515260	4516260	Let's make it 16.
4516260	4517260	You're a hero.
4517260	4518260	If you're 23.
4518260	4519260	I was 23.
4519260	4523820	All I thought to tell him was I was a writer, kind of.
4523820	4525300	I stopped stealing when I was 18.
4525300	4530140	I didn't know a 17 year old could muster a dreadlock.
4530140	4531140	How do you lock them?
4531140	4534740	I was, I was always in like, I was a bodyboarder and so the salt water and the sand gets in
4534740	4537760	your hair and your hair just gets natty and like, it just starts getting knotted.
4537760	4542160	Is there any cultivation at all to it or is it simply the process of my nervous energy?
4542160	4546120	So I twist my hair when it gets long and so that just kind of compounded.
4546120	4550160	I posted a photo of my, my, my senior year ID and I have kind of shitty dreadlocks on
4550160	4551160	my face.
4551160	4555080	I almost had dreadlocks from like not washing it when I was in the Dominican Republic when
4555080	4556080	I was like a kid.
4556080	4557560	You got very thick hair.
4557560	4558560	Yeah.
4558560	4561960	It's really thick and it was long, so it just, it started dreading up and my mom was really
4561960	4562960	mad.
4562960	4563960	She had to comb it all out.
4563980	4564980	All right.
4564980	4568260	We're doing Game of Thrones predictions and we're, and everyone's making one.
4568260	4569260	Oh shit.
4569260	4573020	Um, I got to get it on the record in case I'm right.
4573020	4574780	It's worth it if I'm wrong, who cares?
4574780	4577740	But like some, I just keep going like, come on.
4577740	4581540	I'm so convinced in all of my predictions that I don't want to give any of them because
4581540	4584940	they're spoilers.
4584940	4589460	Everybody feels like there's absolutely no way Lord Tarly on the, on the, on the throne.
4589460	4596840	I'm like, you mean the fat writer character that just has everything go his way because
4596840	4603840	his dad was wrong when he says you should be less fat and you should like writing less.
4603840	4610960	You don't think that, have you noticed that fucking foot pedal jamming during the fucking
4610960	4611960	jazz club?
4611960	4621420	I was like, by the way, there's a fat writer and he gets fucking everything he wants and
4621420	4622420	he's always right.
4622420	4626900	I think the finale of Game of Thrones is gonna be Lord Tarly like fucking mushing his ass
4626900	4631620	like around like Megan and he's gonna like, he's gonna like look at the camera and be
4631620	4638540	like, what told you like, like fucking happy birthday.
4638540	4639540	Fucking bullies.
4639540	4640540	Yeah.
4640540	4642600	But the Game of Thrones is going to be put back in the new library.
4642600	4644860	What do they call that?
4644860	4645860	The new library.
4645860	4646860	The Citadel.
4646860	4647860	Is it the Citadel?
4647860	4648860	Yeah.
4648860	4652960	It's gonna have an office at the Citadel with the sword throne.
4652960	4653960	Yeah.
4653960	4654960	I mean, that was my only prediction.
4654960	4658600	I just, it's one of those things where if people are like, oh, he'd never do that.
4658600	4663400	Like, but if he, and also I guess he's different from the Game of Thrones writers too.
4663400	4668360	Cause they're two, the last two seasons are them just making their own show, right?
4668360	4669360	Yeah.
4669360	4672120	And thanks for addressing Game of Thrones in your last episode.
4672120	4676280	I haven't been able to find a podcast that wanted to talk about Game of Thrones.
4676280	4680700	Also social media has been a real Game of Thrones info desert.
4680700	4685040	It's great that someone who hasn't watched any episodes this season could create an oasis
4685040	4687920	for me to quench my thirst.
4687920	4688920	It's good.
4688920	4692800	Sincerely, Game of Thrones fan 69.
4692800	4694120	I haven't seen it.
4694120	4696360	I would guess Hand of the King for him.
4696360	4697360	Oh yeah.
4697360	4698360	That's my guess.
4698360	4703360	It all just though going to be a very, you know, it's all the, the first two were happy.
4703360	4704360	Right?
4704360	4707360	I mean, pretty much the first two, these first two was like catch ups.
4707360	4710000	These first two, they were like television to me.
4710000	4712160	The last one was pretty, pretty gloomy.
4712160	4713560	Everybody was like getting ready to die.
4713560	4714560	Oh yeah.
4714560	4719680	And they were, and then, and she got the thing and people were posting things of like crying.
4719680	4720680	Like she's a night.
4720680	4724080	One of the Rick and Morty writers pointed out that, cause I haven't seen the episodes,
4724080	4728160	but that they're getting together and they're telling a lot of stories and gathering and
4728160	4734440	like the, the overall message is like, listen, when this much shit happens, like you gotta
4734440	4741520	look back and just be like, God damn, no matter how it turns out, fuck, this was amazing.
4741520	4748680	Like fucking get swept up in, in the, in, in, in whatever happens next, you gotta fucking
4748680	4751080	also remember we moved the needle, bitch.
4751080	4753240	It was a real wild ride, baby.
4753240	4754240	Struck.
4754240	4755240	Cause I liked it.
4755240	4756920	Like someone does a monologue about storytelling.
4756920	4758200	I think it's fat writer.
4758200	4759200	Isn't it?
4759200	4760200	It was like stories.
4760200	4761200	Yeah.
4761200	4762360	You know, that's the fucking thing.
4762360	4763360	Like history.
4763360	4764360	Yeah.
4764360	4765360	I don't remember that.
4765360	4768600	I definitely remember the thing, thinking like, wow, this girl was like seven when we
4768600	4770040	met her and now she's doing this.
4770040	4771600	That was, that was weird.
4771600	4772600	14.
4772600	4773600	Same thing.
4773600	4775080	You clocked it, huh?
4775080	4782880	He's like four more years up on the dial, fictional, fictional countdown clock.
4783080	4788200	So much more per verse, the fanfic countdown clock.
4788200	4795720	I can't wait till the third dragon age when she has acquired the spell casting mana to
4795720	4797520	control that stormtrooper.
4797520	4798520	Oh yeah.
4798520	4800760	Wait, you don't, you know, you're not caught up.
4800760	4801760	I'm not caught up this season.
4801760	4803760	I haven't watched these two episodes.
4803760	4804760	No.
4804760	4805760	Okay.
4805760	4807760	Well, I mean, you wanted to venture into this conversation even.
4807760	4811280	I just want, I just wanted my Charlie theory out there just in case cause I just like,
4811280	4816400	I feel like there's a 5% chance I'm fucking nailing it that he's definitely going to
4816400	4817400	be good.
4817400	4821200	Like, well, he's going to be like winning whatever he's doing because it's like, yeah,
4821200	4823120	he's like the author's insert character.
4823120	4824120	Yeah.
4824120	4826720	I think he's going to be king and then he's going to like, he's going to sit and then
4826720	4830560	he's going to like put his thumb in his mouth, halfway in his mouth and he's going to be
4830560	4834200	like, um, I think you put, I think you make it brand and you put wheels on the, on the
4834200	4835200	throne.
4835200	4836200	Whoa.
4836200	4838280	He's sitting down anyway.
4838280	4840320	Big wheels made out of swords.
4840320	4841320	Just Danielle.
4841320	4842320	Right.
4842320	4843320	Yeah.
4843320	4844320	Game of Thrones fan at all.
4844320	4845320	Predictions.
4845320	4846320	Anything.
4846320	4847320	Get anything off your chest.
4847320	4850720	You haven't had a chance to talk about Game of Thrones on this show for six years.
4850720	4852960	So anything you want to say?
4852960	4855640	The Starks are just going to rule all.
4855640	4856640	Okay.
4856640	4857640	The Starks.
4857640	4858640	There you go.
4858640	4859640	I don't.
4859640	4860640	I don't.
4860640	4861640	That's not my prediction, but I like it.
4861640	4862640	All right.
4862640	4863640	No, I can't.
4863640	4865160	I really think that it's spoil it.
4865160	4866160	So far.
4866160	4867160	Yeah.
4867160	4868160	Let's fight.
4868160	4869160	I love attacking people.
4870160	4874560	Well, what's, what's your concern with giving us your prediction?
4874560	4877360	Like, I truly think a lot of them are right.
4877360	4881200	Like, and so it acts as spoils like it'll be like a bedding pool.
4881200	4884040	We'll get like brackets and stuff like that.
4884040	4885040	I don't want it.
4885040	4886040	I don't know.
4886040	4890080	I mean, we, me and my roommate, my roommate, actually I'm taking my roommates credit, Cali,
4890080	4894000	but uh, you know, she, she and me worked a lot of this out and we definitely called Gendry
4894000	4898220	before the season started called Gendry and Aria and stuff.
4898220	4900420	And then that happened and it was great.
4900420	4903780	And also all the other predictions, they're starting to get seated in these two episodes.
4903780	4906060	And I was like, yeah, they're seeding these exact things.
4906060	4911820	Tell us your prediction, um, which ones, well, who's on the throne at the end?
4911820	4912820	Tyrion.
4912820	4913820	Okay.
4913820	4914820	Yeah, that's what I would say.
4914820	4915820	Yeah.
4915820	4916820	That's what I was going to go.
4916820	4917820	Seems a little on the nose.
4917820	4918820	It is on the nose.
4918820	4919820	I'd rather it be the fat writer.
4919820	4920820	That's the thing.
4920820	4925020	But that's when you look at all the signs, everything's broadcast so clearly and it's
4925020	4927020	almost too obvious.
4927020	4928380	Fat writer will be the hand probably.
4928380	4929380	Right.
4929380	4930380	That's what I said.
4930380	4931380	Yeah.
4931380	4932380	Okay.
4932380	4933380	Yeah.
4933380	4934380	Gotcha.
4934380	4935380	So there's one.
4935380	4937940	Uh, at the end, Jon Snow knows something.
4937940	4941540	Aw, I miss her.
4941540	4942740	Yeah.
4942740	4945420	They're married in real life, apparently.
4945420	4946420	It's awesome.
4946420	4947420	That's like better.
4947420	4948420	Wow.
4948420	4950700	What a, what a different podcast we're capable of.
4950700	4954980	I miss the, I miss the dire wolf.
4954980	4958260	They had one shot in this last episode of the wolf kind of peeking his nose into frame.
4958260	4959260	Yeah.
4959260	4961060	Get these motherfuckers back in action.
4961060	4962780	That was a cheapo.
4962780	4964460	That was a cheapo way of having an agent.
4964460	4965460	Yeah.
4965460	4966460	Yeah.
4966460	4967820	That last episode was like, like a clip.
4967820	4969500	It was just like a big reunion show.
4969500	4970500	Everybody comes out.
4970500	4973020	It's like, I thought the dragons looked really cheap.
4973020	4976340	Was that like a big thing on the internet that the, I thought the first dragon flight,
4976340	4979940	the like the fern gully last rainforest sequence was like, was just, I don't know.
4979940	4981340	It just looked really flat.
4981340	4982340	Maybe they rushed it or something.
4982380	4985740	I thought it was a bit much when like they start fucking and the dragons like giving
4985740	4986740	a thumbs up.
4986740	4989780	I think, I think I made that joke last week.
4989780	4990780	Oh yeah.
4990780	4994300	I didn't know if that was a joke or not.
4994300	4995300	It's both.
4995300	4996300	It really happened.
4996300	4997620	What are we going to be into next?
4997620	5005780	Now the game of thrones is ending and no disrespect, but at some point Marvel has to collapse.
5005780	5009660	Like as a genre, though, are we, are we going to get into film noir?
5009660	5013940	Are we going to get, are we going to just go into a 10 year period of stories about
5013940	5019060	alcoholics that solve mysteries and shouldn't like be problematic with the girl that comes
5019060	5022020	in the door because we're just like anything super and I'm out.
5022020	5026700	I think the future is definitely multi-character mockumentary shows on streaming services.
5026700	5030580	You know, like if they're, you know, taking on popular subcultures that, you know, ignite
5030580	5031940	conversation amongst people.
5031940	5034900	But all these apps I have to install, there are too many to remember.
5034900	5036620	No, it's easy and free.
5036620	5039620	Also, it's channel four 20.
5039620	5044060	It's an easy channel to remember because it's Hitler's birthday, right?
5044060	5045060	Channel four 20.
5045060	5046860	You know, Jeff, it's Columbine.
5046860	5049140	Oh Jesus Christ.
5049140	5055180	Channel four 20, does that, all right, you're really insensitive.
5055180	5056180	Wow.
5056180	5061660	Um, uh, speaking of which, uh, some, uh, comedic plug for the show, that was great.
5061660	5067220	Your detective Ryan Kraus, uh, uh, just did his Columbine episode on his, uh, and he did
5067220	5071220	it on four 20 and, uh, was that like, what was that five hour episode?
5071220	5074300	Yeah, I haven't listened, but Spencer's been in touch with him.
5074300	5076620	Uh, you, you DM'd with him on Twitter.
5076620	5079260	He slid into your DMS, slid into my DMS.
5079260	5080260	Was he thirsty?
5080260	5081260	He was thirsty.
5081260	5082260	Yeah.
5082260	5083260	Yeah.
5083260	5085340	I was sending him some dick pics.
5085340	5087780	Did you slide into his thirsty fams?
5087780	5090860	I slide it into his thirsty fams.
5090860	5091860	Yeah.
5091860	5092860	Yeah.
5092860	5094780	But you have some, you have some interesting things to report.
5094780	5097300	One is that he's not offended by the way we've been speaking.
5097300	5098300	Right.
5098300	5100700	He, or at least he said that, you know, it's been nice.
5100700	5101700	Yeah.
5101700	5102700	He seemed really into it.
5102700	5107620	He, uh, he said he's got, well, no, I don't want to tell his secrets, but, uh, but, uh,
5107620	5108620	he seems like a cool guy.
5108620	5109620	I don't know.
5109620	5110620	He's going to come on the show, right?
5110620	5111620	He's going to come on the show.
5111620	5112620	Sweet.
5112620	5113620	We'll talk to him.
5113620	5114620	Man.
5114620	5115620	Whoa.
5115620	5116620	I've been going through personal growth.
5116620	5117620	Thanks to him.
5117620	5119140	He has a lot of things about redirection of light.
5119140	5120740	It's mind blowing.
5120740	5124900	I want to make a super cut of all the things he said that blew my mind because it's really
5124900	5126300	life changing for me.
5126300	5131820	Spence, how many days into your anti-pot, uh, what, what, I didn't mean that to be
5131820	5132820	crusade.
5132820	5133820	Yeah.
5133820	5134820	Or just like reading yourself of that.
5134820	5139980	Um, uh, well I smoked on four 20, but before that it would be in a week off and before
5139980	5141580	that had been almost a week off.
5141580	5142580	Almost a week off.
5142580	5143580	Yeah.
5143580	5146020	So it's, I'm, I'm pretty low for the past two weeks in terms of weed.
5146020	5147020	I'm having dreams again.
5147020	5148020	It's crazy.
5148020	5149020	Yeah.
5149020	5152260	I felt like there was a demon girl possessing me and we were like arguing over who got to
5152260	5154100	use my arms.
5154100	5157220	See, that's a good dream.
5157220	5158220	Yeah.
5158220	5159420	I have trippy dreams.
5159420	5161180	I had a dream that I had to make.
5161180	5164380	I went to this awesome party and it was like a big, like, like after party of some big
5164380	5165940	rock concert.
5165940	5169420	And for some reason I had to make a hundred people breakfast.
5169420	5170420	Whoa.
5170420	5173780	There was this big stress dream about fucking a hundred people make, but how do you time
5173780	5174780	it out?
5174780	5175780	How do you time out the eggs?
5175780	5176780	It's a one kitchen.
5176780	5177780	I only got four burners.
5178540	5179540	Okay.
5179540	5180540	On dreams.
5180540	5184740	I just have to say, Dan, I actually have had the dream that I've been on Harmontown and
5184740	5185860	you used it.
5185860	5191300	You used it as the opportunity to like, this was my bad dream to like, tell me what you
5191300	5192300	really think.
5192300	5193300	Oh.
5193300	5194300	That was no dream.
5194300	5195300	I swear to God.
5195300	5196300	I've had it.
5196300	5197300	I've had it a couple of times.
5197300	5200460	Cause I thought maybe one day I'd be able to come on here and promote dubstate.
5200460	5202540	But before I did that, how was I doing in the show?
5202540	5203540	Yeah.
5203540	5204540	Yeah.
5204540	5205540	I know you were killing it.
5205540	5206540	Which made the stakes even higher.
5206540	5207540	Thank God.
5208300	5209380	We made Gabe's dream come true.
5209380	5210620	Dan, what do you think?
5210620	5212100	How do you really feel about Gabe's dream?
5212100	5213100	Well, first I have to kill it.
5213100	5214100	Okay.
5214100	5215100	Kill it.
5215100	5216100	That's why I have.
5216100	5217100	You've been killing it?
5217100	5218100	I don't know what to think.
5218100	5219100	People been laughing, man.
5219100	5220100	This is a good show.
5220100	5222100	And Lumpkins, is that you?
5222100	5223100	Hey guys.
5223100	5231700	I was going to, I was going to move on to child rearing.
5231700	5234700	That was my last topic for tonight.
5234700	5242620	Rick and Morty, a writer has an 11 year old nephew who just got an iPhone for his birthday.
5242620	5249220	And his parents check the iPhone, I think they check it every night, I think is the
5249220	5250660	rule or something.
5250660	5255740	So it's like, and it's divorced parents and there's like, I don't want to, that I think
5255740	5256740	is too private.
5256740	5261980	Cause like, yeah, I don't want to question like motivations of who got who's, what am
5261980	5262980	I doing?
5262980	5263980	It's good.
5264260	5266940	He's got an 11 year old nephew that got an iPhone.
5266940	5272220	And if that sounds weird to you or normal to you as anyone's guess, because we don't
5272220	5273980	have rules for these days.
5273980	5276340	Like we don't, we don't have any fucking old standards.
5276340	5280860	And so 11 year old kid's got an iPhone and then the Rick and Morty writer, who's his
5280860	5283780	uncle is getting all these texts from the 11 year old kid.
5283780	5285100	He just got his first phone.
5285100	5291100	Like, I mean, I was an idiot on Friendster when I was 25 because I was like, what?
5291100	5300300	Other people named Dan, we should form a club to be 11 and all of a sudden be able
5300300	5304060	to do what fucking big people do, which is stare at the fucking thing.
5304060	5308660	And like, I don't, I guess I don't have to make a case that the kid deserves a break.
5308660	5309660	It's a kid.
5309660	5312940	But it's just like, just because I imagine being his uncle and his uncle's like, and
5312940	5315740	then at like 6 a.m., I get, I get this text.
5315740	5316740	It's like, sup.
5316740	5317740	Whoa.
5318380	5319380	It's so funny.
5319380	5326100	And he wrote this response about boundaries and stuff, ultimately.
5326100	5330500	And I was like, why wasn't not returning his text an option?
5330500	5335700	And he was like, well, I mean, the long and short of it was like, he's like, well, I don't
5335700	5342020	want to turn dishonest because now there's technology that makes it possible to connect
5342020	5343020	with each other.
5343780	5350260	I just can't have like, I don't want the technology to turn me into a liar.
5350260	5355100	It's kind of what it says, like saying like, like, maybe I'm not always stoked to have
5355100	5358940	my nephew, like, ask me a question at 7 30 or whatever.
5358940	5367700	It's so you guys, how will you raise your children in this new era of nanotrons and
5367700	5368700	microwoms?
5369380	5373180	I do feel like it fucks with your brain.
5373180	5377060	Like, I don't think I would actually stop my kid from using a smartphone or like put
5377060	5378060	an age limit on it.
5378060	5382820	But I would be pretty uncomfortable with the idea of like having that, like that attention
5382820	5383820	kind of thing.
5383820	5386500	I feel very addicted to my phone and I don't like it.
5386500	5391740	Do you think that kids, it's just a specifying of the question, if you will, like, do you
5391740	5397860	think that kids, what if you're raising a kid who like kid age and it's like, it's sort
5397860	5405820	of like, like our parents, my parents is like, oh, let's go to the malt shop because
5405820	5407460	and you're like, where are you going?
5407460	5409140	You're going to the malt shop.
5409140	5415580	All of that fucking that idea of control over your the development of your children, like
5415580	5417980	how much freedom and how much power they have.
5417980	5422140	And you're hearing these stories, you hear these like urban legends, but actual stories
5422140	5426500	of like, she talked her friend into suicide because they were talking every day in the
5426500	5431580	text, like, where are we at with like this idea of like your kid, like, like as a guy
5431580	5437260	who has no kids and it was terrified of the idea, like, what's an addiction to one of
5437260	5440380	the first things I ever did was a movie about suicide.
5440380	5445700	And and I spent a bunch of time in the suicide prevention community and talking about like
5445700	5446980	the young brain.
5446980	5449900	And it's like this addiction to immediate gratification, right?
5449900	5454740	It's like, and that's why the suicide rates are going up amongst younger people, because
5454740	5459820	there's this this addiction to like, you know, if I want to solve a problem, I can
5459820	5461380	solve it like right now.
5461380	5464580	If I want to contact somebody or tell somebody something or buy something like I can get
5464580	5465580	right now.
5465580	5468980	But if I like get kicked out of my house for being gay, or I fight with my breakup with
5468980	5472900	my boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever, you know, you want that immediate gratification.
5472900	5477420	And I think that's like that Pavlovian dog response that we've gotten of like, you know,
5477420	5480020	of being able to Wikipedia or whatever.
5480020	5481820	Yeah, just immediately.
5481820	5485580	Unless we're getting inundated with so much imagery, like the average one of the statistics
5485580	5489340	always blows my mind is the average agency hardcore pornography these days is seven,
5489340	5490340	seven years old.
5490340	5495780	Like, that's when it was nine, like, like 10 years ago, how could we let that Venice
5495780	5496780	sink?
5496780	5505820	The average, the average age of we were once a proud lot, two years old, the golden era.
5505820	5510660	I'm confused, Gabe, with the average age of doing what the average age of hardcore porn
5510660	5513180	for the first time is first.
5513180	5517420	So it's like you add that with the gratification with the media gratification thing with with
5517420	5518420	with all that combined.
5518420	5521060	Yeah, I think it proved like, yeah, I don't want kids.
5521060	5522060	Yeah.
5522060	5526300	Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, we all yeah, we all like look at the fact that like, oh, it's
5526300	5527300	a it's a crazy jungle.
5527300	5531500	And I just like what I'm curious about is like, what you talk to any parent, and it's
5531500	5536620	always a different adventure, like they have to make their own rules on a level that I
5536620	5540540	don't think any previous generation of parent has ever, well, probably
5541060	5544980	fucking pioneer times when you have like a saber tooth tiger and you have to like, you
5544980	5547300	can't you can't just go, I'll do what every family does.
5547300	5549060	No, you get a fucking unique situation.
5549060	5551140	There's piranha there and there's a dinosaur there.
5551140	5555620	I don't know anything about history or yeah, I've been thinking about this a lot lately.
5555620	5561900	I got really scared of technology and everything, but I realized that I was really I think I
5561900	5568140	was really addicted to I went on Tumblr every single day and I quit going on Tumblr.
5568140	5570620	I didn't delete my account or anything because like, I'll go back.
5571340	5574580	But it's been like three or four days since I went on it at all.
5575620	5582220	And I quit because I realized it was I wasn't having any like I spent a lot of alone time
5582220	5583420	and I spent a lot of time in my head.
5583420	5587140	And I realized that instead of going to my own brain for things, I was going to Tumblr
5587140	5593060	for things like instead of going for to my own self for thinking of funny things or whatever
5593060	5597700	or like a comment on something, I'd be like, what do people on Tumblr say or do about this
5597700	5601140	thing or something like if I got into a TV show, instead of just having all these thoughts
5601140	5603260	myself, I'd like search the tag on Tumblr.
5603260	5604260	What did everyone else say?
5604260	5610380	I mean, that's that's so much less shameful than I think I like I recognize that about
5610380	5613620	Twitter like and kept right on chugging.
5614220	5617060	Like I didn't even like notice that and been like, oh, that's bad.
5617060	5618860	I was like, I think in tweets now.
5619460	5620940	I was like, that's how it goes.
5621460	5625780	Well, it was really well, it was really affecting me because also people I think in general,
5626020	5631620	especially online and then especially on Tumblr, people talk very negatively and I really
5631620	5636820	internalize that and stuff like I got a job and then I got really sad about it because
5636820	5639180	everyone talks about like, oh, I have to go to work and stuff.
5639180	5640140	I have to get up in the morning.
5640140	5643900	I'm so sad. But I was like, I'm really happy about my job.
5644060	5648020	But I have like I feel like I have like other people's thoughts in my head like, oh, the
5648020	5650700	Daily Grind. I have what they say about work in my head.
5650700	5653700	Be siblings of yours without even signing up for the job.
5653700	5657940	I think that, you know, each individual of them, of course, you would probably predict
5657940	5662500	along with me that they would be like, no, I'm so stoked for you and all this stuff.
5662500	5664100	It would be like an outpouring of love.
5664100	5669780	But it was like, yeah, that the idea of it's like, yeah, it's interesting.
5669780	5674100	Well, yeah, I got real friends like in real life and then they're very positive about
5674100	5675660	everything, you know, and stuff.
5676980	5681020	I haven't had friends in a while, but there are there are ways to you get.
5681660	5686900	We should be proud of the fact that as like primates, we are super geared towards like
5686900	5694900	picking up on what I would do in this particular context to achieve praise, to feel valuable
5694900	5700540	to like any all these things that we like to regard as like, oh, here are the empirical
5700540	5705940	human experiences as if there's anything empirical about a fucking monkey that that thinks it's
5705940	5714180	half God and like spinning from sentience and like running across the earth going, maybe
5714180	5717100	if I had an alphabet, like it's psychosis.
5717100	5722980	So like there's nothing empirical about what we go through, like the except for the fact
5722980	5728220	that we are that moving planchet on the Ouija board of God's abuse.
5728220	5729220	All right.
5729220	5734620	I went a little too far to use abuse as a metaphor for a Ouija board.
5734620	5735620	That's dumb.
5735620	5740540	Also, why start with the technical French term for the pointer thing on a Ouija board?
5740540	5741540	What are you?
5741540	5743980	A guy who watched 1987's which board?
5745980	5747980	This is exactly what you said in my dream, Dan.
5747980	5748980	This is amazing.
5748980	5750740	There's a word for word.
5750740	5753740	Gabe, I'm doing a show.
5753740	5760180	Everyone's doing a show and you come on here and you think you can be that and do this
5760180	5762700	and that nothing will happen.
5762700	5764260	Everything's going to happen.
5764260	5767100	And everything is nothing.
5767100	5772300	And the difference is a poor man's Jews harp.
5772300	5777380	Playing in the darkness in a jug band on a Hee Haw that's been canceled because you're
5777380	5780420	out of the demo.
5780420	5781420	I'm out of the demo.
5781420	5782420	I'm in the demo, man.
5782420	5783620	I'm the main demo.
5783620	5786180	Will you confide in me because I'm high.
5786180	5793380	This is where I get uncharismatically high, but like I, I was supposed to get less high
5793380	5795420	as the time passes.
5795420	5798940	Did you panic a little bit when you were like, you're like telling the story about how you
5798940	5804140	like literally you were like at jail and you were like, come on, like someone's going to
5804140	5805140	talk to me about this.
5805140	5807340	And I like made the joke of like, that's fucking privilege.
5807340	5811380	And then like right after that you were, you, the word queer came out, you're like, but
5811380	5813980	also I'm fucking gay by the way.
5813980	5819500	Like, did you like at the time when the, um, when that, when that, when that event
5819500	5820500	I scream, I'm gay.
5820700	5825220	Well, no, but you, when you did, you did your impression of it where you were like, I don't
5825220	5826220	know what to do.
5826220	5830740	And then you also said the word queer and I'm curious, like, were you, were you projecting
5830740	5835620	the image for that person of like, I can't, I can't spend fucking Martin Luther King weekend
5835620	5841940	in prison, like, or in jail, like, like, and, and like translated into kind of like, um,
5841940	5850260	sexuality terms a little bit, even more so than, no,
5850260	5851260	he's shaking his head.
5851260	5852260	No.
5852260	5855780	I mean, I channel everything into sexual terms, but I don't, I don't know if I don't, I don't
5855780	5857340	know.
5857340	5859700	This is, this is, I don't know what you're asking.
5859700	5865900	Oh, like, he's talking about the moment when, when, when, what was, what was the, the climax
5865900	5866900	of it?
5866900	5871420	When, when, when telling the story and then he said the word privilege, were you panicked
5871420	5877020	into wanting to seem like more of just a straight white young man who got out of jail for free?
5877020	5879140	Like, oh, did I want a lesson?
5879140	5881420	Or like, oh, I'm also gay, like, I'm also gay.
5881420	5882420	Oh, yeah.
5882420	5883420	Yeah.
5883420	5885060	You're asking why, if that's the reason why I said that?
5885060	5888380	Well, I guess that was a layer of it, but then I was also curious in the meantime, cause
5888380	5891940	I was like, well, that's a, that's, you don't, you also don't have to, we don't have to talk
5891940	5897220	about that, but also going back to that part of the story, I was also curious if that was
5897220	5901620	like, are you asking if what you really wanted to do was call me a faggot just now when you
5901620	5904340	were, when you were putting me in my place and call me out?
5904340	5906340	Well, that's not cool, Dan.
5907140	5908140	Is that where you get that?
5908140	5909140	Too far, bro.
5909140	5910140	Whoa.
5910140	5911140	You're, you're out of the demo.
5911140	5912140	New World, Dan.
5912140	5913140	Yeah.
5913140	5914140	Like, were you going to like, just.
5914140	5916420	Oh, no, that, no, that was not connected.
5916420	5917420	No.
5917420	5918420	No.
5918420	5919420	All right.
5919420	5920420	All right.
5920420	5921420	Cause that, cause that might, that might.
5921420	5922420	I was thinking about age.
5922420	5923420	I was like, cause I was projecting myself.
5923420	5927420	I was, when I think demo, I was like, you're too old, but you're not too old.
5927420	5929620	I was, that's what that was.
5929620	5931780	I was not connecting.
5931780	5934500	I did, I did leap from, you're out of the demo.
5934500	5936100	Hey, can I ask gay questions?
5937100	5940100	That is, that is the core that I follow.
5940100	5944860	That's by the way, that the main center of conversation at Starbirds Industries, most
5944860	5949100	of the time is like, we'll start off in one bit of conversation and then we'll get it.
5949100	5952780	Cause I, I identify as queer, some bisexual, so I'm into both.
5952780	5958060	And um, and it will always, no matter what the, it's like a, the doweling thing or whatever,
5958060	5959060	looking for water.
5959060	5963380	It's like, there will be like a conversation about like, is Nerf still putting out products?
5963380	5966900	And then it'll be like, well, that's interesting because you know, with dicks and vaginas,
5966900	5970260	you know, like it always will lead back to that path.
5970260	5971260	Same.
5971260	5972260	Yeah.
5972260	5973260	Yeah.
5973260	5976300	So in your very Harmon way, I, it was perfect because I didn't understand anything you were
5976300	5977300	really saying.
5977300	5980420	It was completely over my head, but then it got back to dicks.
5980420	5983260	So you want to talk about dicks?
5983260	5987340	I don't, I, we started with balls.
5987340	5989940	I, wait, wait.
5989940	5994900	You once said, you once said in a bar that you find a bisexuality to be the most highly
5994900	5997020	evolved of the species.
5997020	6004580	And I can't tell you how dare you don't tell my millennial audience.
6004580	6008740	It was a brief lapse of closed mindedness.
6008740	6011540	Someone said that to me about like non-binary people.
6011540	6015180	Like, well, that's like, I don't say it to everyone.
6015180	6022060	I think some people aren't to the next stage of evolution, but loss prevention, I think
6022060	6023060	is very important.
6023060	6024060	Yeah.
6024060	6025060	Yeah.
6025060	6026060	Yeah.
6026060	6027060	You ever fired someone?
6027060	6028060	Shrinkage.
6028060	6029060	No.
6029060	6030060	Shrink.
6030060	6031060	Oh, sorry.
6031060	6032060	She's like, yeah, I'm a huge homophobe.
6032060	6033060	No.
6033060	6034060	I don't hit a lot.
6034060	6036540	So my whole life, I grew up with all boys.
6036540	6040100	I have three brothers and a dad and I always thought guys tuck their penis up when they
6040100	6041100	put their pants on.
6041100	6042100	Yeah.
6042100	6043100	Where does it go?
6044020	6046020	Some do.
6046020	6049100	Because you were like, here's how a person looks with their pants down and like.
6049100	6050100	I don't know.
6050100	6054420	I just always thought that guys just tuck their penis up when they put their pants on.
6054420	6055420	You see, tuck it up.
6055420	6056420	Tuck it up where?
6056420	6057420	Like into your waistband?
6057420	6058980	No, just so it's not to the left or right.
6058980	6063500	I always thought for some reason that you would like sit on it or close your legs on
6063500	6064500	it.
6064500	6065620	So you always tucked it up.
6065620	6066620	Some people do.
6066620	6067620	Right.
6067620	6071420	Was this based on you seeing one of your brothers do this or something?
6071420	6072420	No.
6072420	6076500	And it is the conversation like, did you steal that DVD of Demolition Man?
6076500	6079700	Also, you know, do you like your penis?
6079700	6080700	Yeah.
6080700	6081700	Yeah.
6081700	6082700	Does that have something you would not touch?
6082700	6083700	That's actually the first question.
6083700	6086100	I touch your penis and get my interviews with guys.
6086100	6088300	I'm like, where do you put your penis?
6088300	6090420	I have to go to the left or right.
6090420	6091420	Right.
6091420	6094820	I don't think I can deal with the asymmetry.
6094820	6095980	All I had was Game of Thrones.
6095980	6099620	I think it's you could say faggot if you want to, Dan, you can lean right.
6100620	6101620	Where does it go?
6101620	6102620	Say it, Dan.
6102620	6103620	Where does it go?
6103620	6104620	I need to know.
6104620	6105620	There are two different ways.
6105620	6107140	You know, it's not like you're going to be like, faggot.
6107140	6108780	You're going to be like, faggot.
6108780	6111900	You know, you say like you lean into the into the sassy side of it.
6111900	6112900	You can get away with it.
6112900	6115940	You have two queer people giving you permission to say the word faggot.
6115940	6116940	All the way.
6116940	6117940	You're fucking faggot.
6117940	6118940	You're fucking faggot.
6118940	6119940	You're a flathead screwdriver.
6119940	6122380	Like, that was like, that really went.
6122380	6123380	Bring it back.
6123380	6124380	Maybe not.
6124380	6125380	Some people are.
6125380	6126380	Yeah.
6126380	6127380	Where's Dino Stamatopoulos?
6127380	6128380	Let's give him a ride.
6128380	6129380	He's in Europe.
6129380	6136940	And how on Twitter, while a showrunner of community, technically, but it wasn't like
6136940	6137940	the internet was different.
6137940	6140300	It was a fucking showrunner of an NBC sitcom.
6140300	6146860	But still, I've told this story before where my brother tweeted that he was like proud
6146860	6148540	of his daughter or something like that.
6148540	6149540	And I responded.
6149540	6152420	I was just like, faggot.
6152420	6158620	And it was like, I'm not fucking telling you that at the time that was funny.
6159620	6163580	There was no point in explaining that.
6163580	6172260	It was like, for me, as an individual, evident by that behavior, I was in a space where I
6172260	6175860	thought that was absolutely fine.
6175860	6181060	And I remember getting kind of like a bunch of people going like, did you just call that
6181060	6184780	man a faggot for loving his daughter?
6184780	6188500	And being kind of like, yeah, well, it wasn't even about outrage or oppressing.
6188540	6195300	I was like, when you put it that way, even if we were on a desert island, I'm a bad brother.
6195300	6197460	That was a dumb.
6197460	6199620	Why did I think that's funny?
6199620	6204340	But not to mention the fact that then people are like, it was like, but I was just the
6204340	6209100	reason I bring up the story is because I remember I was like doing something around my house
6209100	6215660	and kind of daydreaming about the internet and how it was different 10 years ago, which
6215660	6218980	is such a weird thing because the internet's supposed to be the thing that's different
6218980	6221100	about any years ago.
6221100	6226340	And now, and then thinking back as an old man and going, I remember when I didn't get
6226340	6234060	fired for calling my brother a fagg for loving his daughter in front of everyone.
6234060	6240340	And a couple of people yelled at me and I said, listen, I didn't mean to call my brother
6240340	6241340	a fagg.
6241340	6249460	And the fags talked it out with me and they told me about a charity and I donated to it.
6249460	6255260	And that's why I'm woke.
6255260	6257060	That's my story.
6257060	6260060	So I don't know where this deposition is going.
6260060	6261060	What do you mean?
6261060	6262460	Where are the monsters?
6262460	6264540	They're not here.
6264540	6270220	I took a road called I'm not a monster every day to here.
6270220	6275180	How could I be a monster?
6275180	6283060	Did you know the how to not be a monster guide leads you to monstrosity in the future?
6283060	6288300	All you have to do is not think about anything for 30 years and you'll end up doing everything
6288300	6289740	wrong.
6289740	6291500	It's not fair.
6291500	6294300	My name is Kane Mutiner.
6294300	6295300	Whoa.
6295300	6296300	The third.
6296380	6297380	Whoa.
6297380	6298380	That's a cool name.
6298380	6300380	Why did you improvise?
6300380	6301380	Dumb.
6301380	6302380	Fucking dumb.
6302380	6303380	I liked it.
6303380	6304380	Danielle, what do you think of the podcast?
6304380	6305380	You think it's stupid, don't you?
6305380	6306380	I love it.
6306380	6310980	If a human restarts my podcast, fire the most, fire the person that needs to be fired.
6310980	6312140	He's stealing your time.
6312140	6313140	I can't.
6313140	6316300	So technically I have no power over firing?
6316300	6318380	Make the podcast better with one firing.
6318380	6319380	Oh.
6319380	6321860	Hint, hint.
6321860	6326180	It's the fucking guy that ruins everything.
6326180	6327180	Okay.
6327180	6328180	Who do you want?
6328180	6329180	Fire.
6329180	6330180	Who do you want me to fire?
6330180	6331180	Obviously.
6331180	6335300	We could have Nova fire somebody and then Danielle could sit there as HR and make sure
6335300	6336300	that right.
6336300	6337300	Nova could hurt it.
6337300	6338300	I like this idea.
6338300	6339620	You could lodge a formal complaint about it.
6339620	6340620	Yeah.
6340620	6341620	Do you want to?
6341620	6342620	Your store manager.
6342620	6343620	Yeah.
6343620	6344620	Okay.
6344620	6345620	Here we go.
6345620	6346620	You tell me what you want.
6346620	6347620	You've got to fire one of us off Harmontown.
6347620	6348620	The one who ruins it.
6348620	6351700	Nova didn't sign up for any of this.
6351700	6353500	But she seems kind of excited about it.
6353500	6354500	No?
6354500	6355500	Should we?
6355700	6356700	Uh-oh.
6356700	6357700	How well?
6357700	6358700	Secrets don't make friends.
6358700	6359700	Okay.
6359700	6360700	That's good.
6360700	6362180	There's a little planning.
6362180	6363180	Okay.
6363180	6366700	I'm getting scared now because this is getting legit.
6366700	6367700	Uh-oh.
6367700	6370980	Because there would be all these inter-office emails going on.
6370980	6371980	That's what this is.
6371980	6372980	That's what this is.
6372980	6373980	It represents right now.
6373980	6374980	I don't wish for on whose line is it anyway.
6374980	6377620	You can't get all the preconceived facts.
6377620	6379940	Do you guys have any idea how much thousands of dollars?
6379940	6380940	Okay.
6380940	6381940	Go ahead.
6382380	6385380	I was just going to say, do you have any idea how many thousands of dollars of things I've
6385380	6386380	bought on Amazon?
6386380	6387380	Go.
6387380	6394140	In a new segment called Dan Makes Himself More Relatable, it turns into a war of the
6394140	6395140	coyote.
6395140	6396700	Are you saying you're going to buy us stuff?
6396700	6397700	Yeah.
6397700	6398700	Because that might change our minds.
6398700	6399700	Buy you guys?
6399700	6400700	Yeah.
6400700	6401700	Are you buying us stuff?
6401700	6402700	Do you want a ghillie suit?
6402700	6403700	I have to not get fired?
6403700	6404700	Oh, no.
6404700	6405700	I will.
6405700	6410180	All of our audience guests get $1,000 gifts from Amazon from Dan.
6410180	6411180	Wait.
6411420	6421500	The one that came up here tonight gets a random assortment of mismatched USB-C audio interfaces
6421500	6429620	and fucking random AC adapters and all manner of every USB cable classification of which
6429620	6432140	there are 47.
6432140	6436420	I'll bring it all next week and divvy it between you two.
6436420	6439460	One of you is going to have like a thing that looks like a guitar, but kind of...
6439700	6442460	When I turn 21, you can buy me a Kettle One.
6442460	6443460	Yeah.
6443460	6444460	That's cheap.
6444460	6445460	Okay.
6445460	6446460	It's expensive then.
6446460	6447460	What did I interrupt?
6447460	6448460	Pumpkin liqueur.
6448460	6450460	There was a show happening.
6450460	6451460	Mr. Harmon?
6451460	6452460	Right.
6452460	6453460	Can you come to the office, please?
6453460	6454460	Oh, okay.
6454460	6455460	Yeah.
6455460	6457460	Well, I'll finish pricing these lettuce heads.
6457460	6459460	You used to be...
6459460	6461460	You used to lay into them.
6461460	6463460	I'm here to back up.
6463460	6465460	That's how it is.
6465460	6466460	I'm here to back up.
6466460	6467460	Should I be hard?
6467460	6468460	Oh, you'd be hard.
6468460	6470460	You give it to them.
6470460	6475980	So, Mr. Harmon, can I call you Dan?
6475980	6476980	You can call me anything you want.
6476980	6478180	I just not leave for dinner.
6478180	6482220	Do you have any brothers or sisters, Dan?
6482220	6483580	What are you doing for the holiday weekend?
6483580	6484580	What's...
6484580	6486580	How are you doing?
6486580	6487580	Whoa.
6487580	6488580	I don't know.
6488580	6493700	I usually just hang out at home, but I never thought I'd have to tell.
6493700	6500300	So, the thing is that we've been a little light on some of the stock this week.
6500300	6503860	Have you been into the bath section of the supermarket?
6503860	6504860	Bath section?
6504860	6505860	Or aisle seven?
6505860	6506860	Bath.
6506860	6513580	Aisle seven, you know, shampoos and razors and things.
6513580	6516340	You usually stock that aisle, don't you?
6516340	6517340	Yeah.
6517340	6523580	Well, we've been a little bit light on some of the Dove shampoo.
6523580	6528020	It was missing, actually, and we couldn't account for it.
6528020	6531900	And you know, we know it was you, Dan.
6531900	6537700	We know you stole two cases of Dove shampoo and conditioner.
6537700	6541540	The peach-scented women's Dove shampoo.
6541540	6544420	I know my rights.
6544420	6545420	I know my rights.
6545420	6546980	I'm not...
6546980	6548220	This is not a police matter, Dan.
6548220	6552580	I never walked out of the store.
6552580	6556180	One of our other employees, I can't tell you who, they saw it in the trunk of your
6556180	6557180	car.
6557180	6560180	They saw the peach-Dove shampoo.
6560180	6565180	Arrest the rays that come out of my eyes, because those are the only things...
6565180	6568180	There's video evidence of you leaving the store.
6568180	6569180	Are you asking me...
6569180	6571580	It would just be better if you admitted it.
6571580	6576580	Are you asking me to confirm that I stole property from your store?
6576580	6577580	Just level with it.
6577580	6579260	I'm taking off the general manager hat.
6579260	6580620	Oh, shit.
6581140	6583740	We're putting it in the trash, even.
6583740	6584740	I'm not going to put it back on.
6584740	6587380	It would be in your best interest if you just told us the truth.
6587380	6588380	All right.
6588380	6591020	Is the hat what actually makes you a general manager?
6591020	6592020	Yes.
6592020	6593020	Yes, it is.
6593020	6594940	Well, who is she?
6594940	6595940	This is Danielle.
6595940	6597860	This is our head of HR.
6597860	6600860	She's just here to make sure that your rights are not being violated.
6600860	6602140	I'm on your side.
6602140	6603140	I'm on your side.
6603140	6604140	All right.
6604140	6605140	Okay.
6605140	6609780	Just admit you were wrong, and we will settle this.
6609780	6612220	This is what the kids call a complete...
6612220	6613220	Whoa.
6613220	6620780	I think I was targeted for fucking one course when I rolled in here.
6620780	6621780	Okay.
6621780	6622780	Targeted how, Dan?
6622780	6623780	What?
6623780	6625020	Targeted how?
6625020	6628740	You came in smelling like cannabis, and we don't appreciate that here.
6628740	6629740	Oh.
6629740	6631580	You buried the lead.
6631580	6635700	Well, I can't fire you for that, but we have...
6635700	6639140	You can't fire me for smelling like cannabis, can you?
6639140	6640140	Unless...
6640140	6641140	Unless...
6641140	6645460	Unless I admit I smoked cannabis.
6645460	6648820	By the way, she and I have been having an affair.
6648820	6649820	That's why I know all this shit.
6649820	6650820	I can't admit it.
6650820	6651820	I can't admit it, though.
6651820	6652820	Shh.
6652820	6653820	You weren't supposed to say that.
6653820	6654820	By the way, it's possible.
6654820	6655820	So, you...
6655820	6656820	I don't know.
6656820	6658860	I didn't mean to hijack the scene.
6658860	6663780	I will deny everything you say, so you can say whatever you want.
6663780	6664780	This is Ralph.
6664780	6665780	I'm the owner of this Ralph's department store.
6665780	6666780	Oh, sir.
6666780	6667780	Oh, shit.
6667780	6668780	It's Ralph.
6669420	6670420	It's Ralph.
6670420	6671420	It has been stealing bath salts.
6671420	6672420	Ralph, please.
6672420	6675180	This little faggot right here has been stealing bath salts.
6675180	6676180	And I know it.
6676180	6680420	You fire his ass, take him out, tuck his dick between his legs, and get him the fuck out
6680420	6681420	of here.
6681420	6682420	No!
6682420	6683420	No!
6683420	6684420	All right.
6684420	6685420	That won't...
6685420	6686420	All right, Mr. Harmon, you're fired.
6686420	6687420	Okay.
6687420	6688420	End of the week, you're done.
6688420	6689420	Oh, shit.
6689420	6693660	But you can still claim unemployment if you want, so go for it.
6693660	6695860	Well, he can.
6695860	6696860	He does get unemployment?
6696860	6697860	He can claim it.
6697940	6698940	I'm gonna fight it, though.
6698940	6699940	Whoa.
6699940	6700940	I will fight it.
6700940	6705940	Yeah, I do think bisexuals and non-binaries are the next stage of evolution.
6705940	6706940	Yeah!
6706940	6709540	All right, I won't fight it.
6709540	6710540	You're good to go.
6710540	6711540	I mean...
6711540	6713020	Nova and Daniel, you missed.
6713020	6714980	He was about to admit that he stole the soap.
6714980	6715980	No, no, no.
6715980	6716980	He's good.
6716980	6717980	He just...
6717980	6718980	Well, I was...
6718980	6719980	What were you doing with all that peach shampoo?
6719980	6721980	What were you doing with all the peach shampoo?
6721980	6722980	Daniel?
6722980	6723980	I don't even know.
6723980	6727020	I mean, I...
6727020	6730540	If I say that I...
6730540	6736340	The devil, like, makes me into shampoo, am I gonna get less jail or more?
6736340	6738220	Did I not kill this scene with the...
6738220	6739220	No, you said knock.
6739220	6740220	Like, I thought that was the...
6740220	6741220	No, you said knock.
6741220	6742220	Was that a bookend there?
6742220	6743220	It was solid.
6743220	6748220	Oh, we were doing the porn version of improv where we didn't know how to guess-hand each
6748220	6749220	other.
6749220	6750220	I'm here to fix this thing.
6750220	6751220	No, you're not.
6751220	6752220	No, I'm...
6752220	6753220	No, I'm not.
6753220	6754220	No, I'm...
6754220	6755220	No, I'm...
6755220	6757420	No, I'm a cut.
6757420	6762380	Mr. Harmon, there are also several cases of pantyhose missing from our women's department.
6762380	6765740	That's where I thought it was going, because I think that those are also stored in a bath
6765740	6766740	aisle, right?
6766740	6771620	That was like a passing thing of that idea of, like, kids when they...
6771620	6772620	Like, that...
6772620	6774220	Like, the nine going to seven.
6774220	6776220	Nova, you're incredibly young.
6776220	6777220	I don't...
6777220	6782980	But you're an adult, but you're not a drinking adult.
6782980	6785180	That's exactly where you're at right now.
6785180	6786340	Do you...
6786340	6789180	And you have absolutely every right not to answer.
6789180	6790180	Do you have...
6790180	6796380	Does anything stick out to you about your exposure to hardcore pornography?
6796380	6797380	It's a tasteful podcast.
6797380	6798380	God damn it.
6798380	6802820	I'll tell the story about the first time I ever saw porn.
6802820	6806180	It was, what year did the movie Mordecai come out with Johnny Depp?
6806180	6807180	Oh, that movie's terrible.
6807180	6808180	Recently.
6808180	6809180	Very recently.
6809180	6810180	It was...
6810180	6811180	What was it?
6811180	6813140	Like, 2015 or 2014 or something.
6813140	6816660	And I really liked that movie, and I liked the guy in it.
6816660	6819740	And I looked up on Google, not looking for porn whatsoever.
6819740	6822580	Just Google images, just friendly, safe photos.
6822580	6825980	I looked up blonde men with mustaches.
6825980	6832140	That's in my favorites.
6832140	6835860	Because I was like, more please.
6835860	6838380	And I saw...
6838380	6843100	And I saw a porn video, and I was like, all right, I guess today's the day.
6843100	6846100	I got to see porn for the first time sometime, and I clicked on it.
6846100	6847100	Wait, how old were you?
6847100	6848100	Seven.
6848100	6849100	Is that what you said?
6849100	6854700	I was probably 15 or 16, whatever year the movie Mordecai came out.
6854700	6856780	So I think like 16, probably.
6856780	6860860	I'm gonna stop asking questions, because it's like, it's uncharismatic now.
6860860	6861860	What was your first...
6861860	6862860	I told a story.
6862860	6863860	You weren't even asking.
6863860	6864860	Well, I remember...
6864860	6868340	No, no, but I was curious about that, because I was thinking about mine, which I can volunteer
6868340	6869340	and which won't feel...
6869340	6870340	Yeah, what's your first penetrative...
6870340	6872860	46-year-old dude that can just tell you like...
6872860	6873860	Integrative porn.
6873860	6883100	No, like looking at actual, yeah, I've mentioned this on the podcast before, that it was...
6883100	6886820	My dad had a box in his basement, and that was Playboy.
6886820	6891740	He had a subscription to Playboy for a year of his life, and there was no hard drive.
6891740	6897060	We didn't know that porn was infinite, so even if you got married, you would just put
6897060	6900380	all your Playboys in a box, I guess, and put it...
6900380	6901380	There was just...
6901380	6908580	Somehow over the years, we knew, 20 years, me and my brother, somehow we'd figured out
6908580	6913780	there's like 17 magazines up on the top shelf in the basement somewhere that represent my
6913780	6916580	dad's...
6916580	6917580	Cardinal knowledge.
6917580	6924780	Final years as a subscriber to being a single guy in the form of something that you couldn't...
6924780	6926660	There was no internet to look at.
6926660	6938640	You couldn't type in boobs, but the hardcore thing was like we would hunt for crawdad crayfish,
6938640	6939640	we called them.
6939640	6940640	In Milwaukee?
6940640	6941640	Yeah, like crayfish.
6941640	6947580	They were like in this pond where we would ride our dirt bikes up there, so it was like,
6947580	6956940	I want to say 10, nine or 10, and yeah, there was this creek and pond, and then on the other
6956940	6960820	side of these railroad tracks, there was this printing company, and one of their clients
6960820	6968100	was Hustler, and there was just this kind of general...
6968100	6973380	I don't know how, I don't know by what system, but it was sort of like in this weird place
6973380	6980280	where you hunted for crayfish, part of the magic of that area was that if you rooted
6980280	6987900	around enough, you were going to eventually find weird, loose, muddy pages of cast off
6987900	6994980	like misprinted pornography from the only periodical that I'm sure out of all that printing
6994980	6996220	plant probably wasn't just...
6996220	7000220	It didn't say Hustler on the top of the printing plant, it was probably just this chugga chugga,
7000220	7008060	we turn acid into paper or vice versa kind of like plant, but the only thing that they
7008060	7013500	accomplished that made it into grubby hands that probably left and then turned into things
7013500	7019420	that were amenable to the wind.
7019420	7027940	We didn't learn anything about cooking, there would be a fucking muddy rock and you'd lift
7027940	7028940	it.
7028940	7036060	You'd see something, pull it out, and it'd be this weird pictorial about a truck driver
7036060	7042660	stopping in a diner, but will you show me what today's specials are and we would all
7042660	7043660	huddle around it.
7043660	7048340	That's a tactile experience, that's a nice hands-on, I spent some time growing up in
7048340	7055900	the Midwest and a tornado season came through and ripped down the janitor's little shack
7055900	7056900	that he had.
7057900	7063660	The whole thing didn't go down, but it was partially messed up, and the next day there
7063660	7071420	was porn magazines around campus, hanging in a tree was the Jenny McCarthy playboy
7071420	7079940	one of her in the bathtub, and I remember a couple friends reaching up at it, like you're
7079940	7081580	reaching for it.
7081580	7084380	And they never got polio.
7084380	7086140	That sounds more rustic than a misplaced do-goer.
7086140	7089780	You can parse that information however you want.
7089780	7091140	My first heavy porn was a magazine.
7091140	7092140	But cheap and open mind.
7092140	7095620	Mine was when we were on tour with the king and I, I was at this point 10 years old, and
7095620	7101540	we were hotels every three weeks across the country, and we were like St. Louis or Cincinnati
7101540	7108620	or somewhere, and I found something under the bed, or maybe one of the other kids in
7108620	7112460	the show found something under their hotel room bed, and it was a porn mag of pretty
7112460	7115500	hardcore stuff, and it was all black people.
7115500	7118980	It was like an ebony kind of thing, and it was really wild.
7118980	7119980	And I'd never seen...
7119980	7120980	Yes, queen.
7120980	7121980	I don't know.
7121980	7122980	I just...
7122980	7125980	Look, I try to stay relevant.
7125980	7126980	All right.
7126980	7127980	I'm proud of you.
7127980	7132100	We just sat there on the bed and just went through it, and I was like, what?
7132100	7133100	What is that?
7133100	7134100	What is that?
7134100	7137460	And what's that white stuff, and what the fuck is going on?
7137460	7140460	We were like detectives trying to reverse it.
7140460	7141460	Do they like each other?
7142460	7147260	Is that pee, or is that, if it was hustler, the answer was, I don't know?
7147260	7148260	That's the problem.
7148260	7149560	I think that's not the problem.
7149560	7153700	Did you guys all find the porn before you ever had the talk, or after?
7153700	7155460	I can't remember the talk.
7155460	7159780	I've told the story before on my podcast, but I think my mom at a pretty early age,
7159780	7164220	and I think with the best of intentions, did say this line to me that I never forgot, which
7164220	7170420	was, do you know how babies get made, and I was like, I don't know.
7170460	7174700	I really don't remember how old I was when I remember my mom going, and my mom would
7174700	7178900	be like, this isn't fair, this retelling of the fucking story, and now I sympathize with
7178900	7185300	her now that my comedy sketch from 2009, I'm starting to realize what I've put my parents
7185300	7189980	through as an adult, and the retelling of their fucking foibles when they were children
7189980	7190980	having children.
7190980	7198420	But I remember my mom saying, the man sees a naked lady, and his penis stands up and
7198420	7203500	starts to dance around, and it shoots white stuff out of it.
7203500	7204500	Dances around?
7204500	7211140	There's no contact in that story, that man sees a fucking woman, and his penis.
7211140	7215180	What was his dad doing right?
7215180	7219860	That was the birds and bees talk that I got, but I do think I learned about sex from porn.
7219860	7225340	I could see that the grownups in the porn movies that we could see, my dad had VHS tapes,
7225340	7229660	and we were seeing these hustler magazines, we could see that one thing that correlates
7229660	7234140	to the thing that we know that makes boys, that's going in there, we could see it going
7234140	7235140	in there.
7235140	7240140	But it's still countless debates about, is that where she pees?
7240140	7241140	What's that stuff?
7241140	7242140	What's that stuff?
7242140	7245740	You were actively looking for it, that's the other thing, only a kid needs to Google the
7245740	7251060	word boy or girl, or man, woman, whatever, and that stuff just appears.
7251060	7253100	They'll find it.
7253100	7257660	And I think that's a whole other mindset, which is, I was right on the cusp, I'm right
7257660	7264060	at the age where I was still looking in National Geographic for boobies and such, and hoping
7264060	7267500	for a wee-wee, but they never had the wee-wees.
7267500	7273100	I think literally the last generation who had, right before it, crossed over, and I
7273100	7280220	would actively look for it, but if it's thrown in your face, that's the whole thing, right?
7280220	7281980	Aren't we having sex less now?
7281980	7282980	That's a thing, right?
7283460	7286540	But I think that's got, I've read those headlines where I'm like, millennials are having sex
7286540	7291980	less, and I'm like, I know why, and it ain't got nothing, like, oh my God, what a fucking
7291980	7294380	contract for the rest of your life.
7294380	7299380	Well, there's a lot of people saying, which makes sense, that porn is so crazy, and there's
7299380	7304380	all this stuff, and then you could have it any time, any place, and so you could see
7304380	7308260	it, and so then, and then you could watch more and more hardcore stuff that maybe you'd
7308260	7312780	never get the opportunity to do in real life, so you get overstimulated by that, so then
7312780	7314540	real sex is, like, boring to people.
7314540	7315540	There's supposedly that's happened.
7315540	7317540	That's the problem I'm having, yeah, yeah, totally.
7317540	7320540	I do want to say another side to that.
7320540	7321540	It sucks that porn does that.
7321540	7326660	I want to offer, I want to offer a counterpoint to that, just because I remember being a very
7326660	7332380	sexually, like, non-functional person, and reading that stuff, and, like, really letting
7332380	7337140	it add to my shame, that what I was reading was the, like, it was, like, the self-fulfilling
7337140	7338900	prophecy of, like, well, what do you expect?
7338900	7340900	All you do is jerk off all over the internet.
7340900	7345620	Of course, now you're becoming golem, because you, like, what are you going to do except
7345620	7349700	hang out and, like, polish your ring in a fucking cave, even though that's the one place
7349700	7351380	you don't need to be visible.
7351380	7357300	You eat fish all day, like, who cares who sees you, but, like, and I have a million
7357300	7363060	questions about Lord of the Rings, but I do want to counter that just a little bit, because
7363060	7367300	remembering the amount of shame that that made me feel, and the amount of truth that
7367300	7373300	that wasn't necessarily, I do absolutely think that people online that are, like,
7373300	7379620	you know, I'm touching myself so much that, like, it's a dysfunction, and of course that's
7379620	7385520	why I'm not this or that, like, it just, it makes me want to burst into tears thinking
7385520	7393140	about that, and I just want to say that, like, being with someone that you can trust, like,
7393140	7398380	feeling that you have permission to be who you are, it erases everything.
7398380	7401980	It's not, it's just, it's done and done.
7401980	7405740	You're not damaging yourself by indulging yourself.
7405740	7411140	You're not, you're not a fucking, like, phone battery that you can run out.
7411140	7414540	You're not, you're not a product.
7414540	7420460	If you're isolated and alienated and numb, and, like, however you're dealing with it,
7421300	7430140	and your libido will be healthy soon, whenever it needs to be, it'll be right there, like,
7430140	7439140	as if it is, oh boy, I just don't want to, like, cliffhangers, thank you so much, everybody.
7439140	7442340	Let's give it up for Nova Danielle, everybody.
7442340	7447700	If we could leave you on one note, it would be how much I'm, what, how much I'm coming.
7448700	7450700	Shit, it's just a weird song.
7450700	7451700	That was about how the kids are coming.
7451700	7457700	All right, watch Dope State on Pluto.nash app.
7457700	7459700	Channel 420.

7460700	7466700	Don't tell the truth to human resources if you work at a place that's worth its salt,
7466700	7470700	and buy Nova a drink in a year.
7470700	7475700	All right, Nova Danielle, give it up for Gabe Sunday, everybody.
7475700	7482700	And his drug dealer mother, Spencer Critton, and I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis,
7482700	7484700	and your mayor is Mr. Dan Harmon.
7484700	7487700	Thank you all for coming.
