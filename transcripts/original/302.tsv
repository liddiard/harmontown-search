35280	39520	Yes. Yes.
41760	47680	I have the unique and special honor of bringing to you now two-time Amy winner.
47680	55760	God bless you, Rick and Morty. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together
55760	60000	for the mayor of Hormontown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
60400	74880	Yes, yes, yes, yes. Rap to beat, yes, yes, yes, yeah. Rap to the beat,
74880	79680	rap to the rhymes, rap to your mama's booty, wind chimes blowing in the wind,
79680	84240	ringing around. I booked you so hard. I bought her by the pound, went to the deli,
84240	89120	got three ounces, booked your mama like a lion, pounces, on the pussy,
89120	93120	9 to 5, fuck your mama just to stay alive, I'm a vampire.
93120	95120	I gotta suck your mama.
96120	97120	Osama.
98120	99120	Knock it down.
99120	100120	Knock your mama's pussy down.
100120	102120	Where was Building 7?
102120	103120	Okay.
105120	108120	Did you know your mama's pussy does not...
108120	110120	its boiling point is less than steel?
112120	115120	Just start asking questions, America.
116120	118120	Stop, you fucking sheeple.
120120	123120	Yeah, I mean, like, well, we had our 300th episode,
123120	124120	it was the last thing we did, right?
124120	127120	And I watched that clip of me trying to learn from open mic.
128120	130120	We did an episode after that.
130120	131120	Oh, did we?
132120	134120	I just, I don't know why I can't learn things.
135120	138120	Because you have to remember shit to learn.
139120	143120	You can be a really hard worker, it wouldn't matter if you're an alcoholic.
145120	147120	God, I've been to the crossroads eight times,
147120	148120	when are we gonna learn the blues?
148120	150120	You keep drinking too much.
151120	153120	Ralph Macchio in the movie Crossroads.
155120	158120	I don't know, I obviously...
159120	164120	Yes, I do have a story from Emmy night
164120	166120	that I don't think will give me any trouble.
166120	168120	Did you, you were at the Emmys?
168120	170120	I was at the Emmys and I won an Emmy.
170120	172120	We all, obviously...
173120	175120	And what I mean is, when I say,
176120	179120	I mean, the show that I work on,
179120	181120	but where are the...
182120	184120	This show is about me, I won an Emmy.
185120	187120	But in mixed company, I'd be like,
187120	189120	you know who won an Emmy?
189120	191120	It's Sid in marketing.
193120	195120	Remember when they marketed
195120	198120	Brick and Morty successfully in that fateful day?
198120	199120	Yeah.
199120	200120	Thank you, Sid.
201120	202120	It is an award for everybody.
202120	203120	So you were saying?
204120	206120	Well, I do have...
207120	209120	Look, here, the craziest fucking thing...
213120	214120	Maybe I oversold it by saying that,
214120	216120	because it's also like, insidiously not crazy.
216120	218120	It was just this odd thing.
218120	219120	Or maybe I'm listening to too many
219120	221120	of these like, creepy pasta podcasts
221120	222120	where there's just like, these little stories
222120	224120	about little shit where you encounter,
224120	226120	like you accidentally like,
226120	228120	open this Lovecraftian advent window
228120	231120	on the calendar of your monotonous life
231120	233120	and then, ooh, I rode the subway wrong
233120	234120	and then the people had tentacles
234120	235120	and Slender Man was like,
235120	237120	what, next stop, I have no face.
238120	240120	And then you went back and you were like,
240120	242120	never touch an elevator wrong.
242120	244120	Are you gonna tell the Emmy story
244120	246120	in a crazy Canadian voice?
248120	250120	One of the things I like to do
250120	252120	is go to the Emmy Awards.
256120	260120	So you get sat in, you know,
260120	262120	with your peeps, like,
262120	264120	it's a big production,
264120	267120	we got like, basically a full row
267120	270120	in this auditorium is sort of like,
270120	272120	you look down the row
272120	274120	and you're seeing people that you worked with
274120	276120	and that are there tonight for,
276120	278120	that are on the show.
278120	280120	And, but that's not, you know,
280120	281120	you don't recognize them,
281120	282120	it's an entire row,
282120	285120	so that's not necessarily a thing
285120	286120	that you're conscious of.
286120	288120	And then, so Justin,
288120	290120	because he's the cool one,
290120	291120	shows up last.
291120	294120	And I had been sitting there with Cody
294120	296120	and then there's another row behind us
296120	298120	and Ryan Ridley's back there
298120	300120	and it's like, people like,
300120	303120	you know, there's another whole row behind us
303120	306120	and people are chatting and things
306120	308120	and the theater slowly fills up
308120	310120	and Justin's like rolling in
310120	312120	with his girlfriend like,
312120	314120	really close to just like,
314120	315120	the lights are going down
315120	316120	and they're gonna,
316120	318120	a guy comes out and he explains
318120	321120	your acceptance speech has to be this long
321120	323120	and if I do this, you gotta do this or whatever.
323120	325120	And it's like, not a big deal,
325120	327120	but Justin's like standing in the aisle
327120	329120	and he's got his date
329120	332120	and it's like, he's making this gesture
332120	333120	and we finally realize,
333120	335120	oh shit, we look at the row
335120	338120	and there's one seat empty
338120	340120	and he's standing there with his date
340120	342120	and he's going like,
342120	343120	you know, he's like making this
343120	345120	because we're all having to be hushed now
346120	348120	and we're like, oh God,
348120	350120	there's one seat open
350120	352120	and so then this kind of flurry
352120	354120	of this panic starts to happen
354120	356120	and we're like, what could possibly go wrong?
356120	358120	So I don't know when to reveal
358120	360120	that this whole time in this story,
360120	363120	there's this guy sitting there
363120	365120	that is alone
365120	369120	and does not work on the show
369120	372120	and it's just sort of like,
372120	374120	he looks like, you know,
374120	376120	if I was casting this movie,
376120	381120	I would cast Jolo Trullio as this guy.
381120	386120	He was an attractive man
386120	390120	in a respectfully diminutive package
390120	391120	that's sort of like,
391120	393120	he's not a big bruiser,
393120	395120	he's not a basketball player,
395120	397120	he's kind of like, here I am,
397120	400120	I'm this guy, I got my frame
400120	402120	and I'm occupying my space
402120	404120	and he looked good in his suit
404120	407120	and he was sitting there
407120	409120	when I got there
409120	411120	and I got there, you know, pretty early
411120	414120	and the theater was like filling up
414120	415120	and he was just sitting there.
415120	418120	So like, who is going to,
418120	420120	Justin's going like,
420120	422120	what do I, I don't know.
422120	424120	So then obviously the first thing
424120	426120	everybody that's like me is going to go like,
426120	428120	okay, this must be my fault,
428120	429120	I'm going to look at my ticket
429120	432120	and I look and I go,
432120	433120	oh, see, and Cody's like,
433120	435120	see, you're in the 315
435120	436120	and look where you're,
436120	439120	and I'm in 313 or something like that
439120	441120	and she's like, and I'm in 314
441120	444120	and this Jolo Trullio guy is like next to her
444120	447120	and we're like, okay, all right,
447120	448120	and the guy is like,
448120	450120	he's not not participating in it,
450120	451120	he's not with anybody,
451120	452120	he's not distracted,
452120	454120	he's just sort of watching it all unfold.
454120	456120	He's just going like,
456120	461120	and then we go 315
461120	463120	and Cody, it's like,
463120	465120	I'm standing in 313,
465120	467120	she's standing in 314.
467120	470120	So like already, you know,
470120	475120	but we're still airing on the side of caution
475120	476120	by going,
476120	478120	so Cody goes,
478120	480120	sorry, what seat are you in?
480120	481120	Then he's been watching
481120	484120	and he looks down between his legs
484120	487120	and he looks where the seat thing is
487120	489120	because he's like 315
489120	494120	and we're like, okay, well,
494120	496120	but also that doesn't explain,
496120	498120	like just him being in the wrong seat
498120	499120	doesn't explain anything,
499120	503120	but him not supposed to be there-ing
503120	505120	would explain everything.
505120	507120	He'd explain everything.
507120	508120	He didn't show you a ticket.
508120	509120	If he was an alien,
509120	511120	it would explain everything
511120	512120	because then there would be
512120	515120	exactly two seats that are,
515120	516120	the two people that are there
516120	517120	in the full row,
517120	519120	but no one's going there in their head.
519120	520120	Everyone's just like,
520120	522120	oh, okay, so,
522120	524120	and it's like clear,
524120	525120	I'm telling you,
525120	526120	he's not being passive-aggressive,
526120	527120	like ignoring us.
527120	530120	He's sort of fascinated by what's happening.
530120	532120	He's kind of helping out a little bit.
532120	534120	It's kind of hard to describe.
534120	535120	Sorry, I'm spilling my drink everywhere,
535120	538120	but he's sort of involved.
538120	539120	He is.
540120	542120	I'm judging too much,
542120	544120	I'm analyzing too much during the story
544120	546120	because I'd like to analyze it
546120	547120	forever after the story,
547120	549120	but a footnote here is,
549120	551120	looking back on it,
551120	552120	my perception is that
552120	554120	his goal was to fucking blend
554120	556120	and you don't blend by just
556120	557120	ignoring everyone.
557120	559120	He also was like,
559120	561120	uh-huh, uh-huh,
561120	565120	he was part of the fracas.
565120	567120	He was helping out.
568120	569120	And he goes like,
569120	570120	and then he goes,
570120	571120	I'm sorry, can we,
571120	572120	and he goes,
572120	574120	you want to switch seats?
574120	575120	And he gets up
575120	577120	and he switches seats with me,
577120	579120	which just skirts the issue.
579120	580120	It's just fucking,
580120	583120	he gets me in the right seat
583120	585120	and look, we're all fuck-ups here.
585120	588120	I've been sitting in 313 my whole life
588120	589120	and I'm 315.
589120	591120	Who are we going to judge right now?
591120	592120	And he's like,
592120	593120	so I'm switching seats with this guy
593120	594120	and then he just plops down
594120	596120	and it just keeps mounting
596120	597120	because it's like,
597120	598120	there's this,
598120	599120	it's a situation
599120	601120	where there's no authority really.
601120	603120	It's not like a theater
603120	604120	where you're like,
604120	605120	I'm going to go get the kid
605120	606120	with the flashlight.
606120	607120	I'm going to put an end
607120	608120	to all this shenanigans.
608120	610120	Someone's god damn it.
610120	612120	It's a too big a theater
612120	614120	and the timing's wrong
614120	616120	and the anxiety's wrong.
616120	618120	You don't do that here,
618120	619120	it feels like.
619120	620120	You don't know what to do.
620120	621120	And so because no one knows
621120	622120	what to do,
622120	625120	but the urgency keeps heightening,
625120	626120	something happens
626120	627120	and something just snaps
627120	629120	and that's the part of the story
629120	630120	I don't really know
630120	632120	because somewhere over there
632120	635120	where this guy has switched seats with me,
635120	639120	somebody finally has an exchange with him
639120	642120	that very quickly gets resolved
642120	643120	and he goes like,
643120	644120	oh, it's there.
644120	645120	And then he just,
645120	646120	he starts leaving
646120	647120	and then we're like,
647120	649120	and then Justin and Ozzy
649120	650120	are going to go like,
650120	651120	sit down now
651120	653120	and in the wake of it we're like,
653120	654120	okay, cool.
654120	657120	I'll go, what the fuck?
657120	658120	And then the person
658120	659120	that was over there
659120	660120	that had had the immediate exchange,
660120	661120	I was like,
661120	666120	he said he was a seat filler.
666120	667120	No.
667120	668120	I don't know.
668120	669120	What?
669120	670120	I don't know.
670120	671120	Someone has misinterpreted
671120	672120	that job description.
672120	673120	Yeah.
673120	674120	Yeah.
674120	676120	Ain't no volunteer seat filler.
676120	678120	So I'm like,
678120	682120	so a couple of the logic tree branches here
683120	684120	are like, okay,
684120	688120	world's most like dedicated seat filler.
688120	690120	Paul Blart seat filler.
690120	691120	Like that's the bit is like,
691120	692120	I'm going to,
692120	694120	I was born to fill seats.
694120	695120	I'm going to fit.
695120	696120	My mom always said,
696120	698120	never leave a seat unfilled.
698120	700120	Like it's just some perversion of a seat.
700120	701120	That doesn't exist.
701120	704120	That's not, that's not real.
704120	706120	Then a cousin of that theory is,
706120	707120	I just picture the guy,
707120	708120	like it's something,
708120	709120	there's like seat filler culture
709120	710120	where the guy's like,
710120	713120	you ever hear of Dale Shannon man?
713120	714120	No, Dale.
714120	715120	What?
715120	719120	Season three of Nash bridges.
719120	721120	Golden Globes.
721120	724120	Jeremy seat fills next to Melanie Griffith.
724120	725120	Yeah.
725120	727120	Don Johnson's in the bathroom.
727120	728120	Food poisoning.
728120	732120	Jeremy ends up going to the governor's ball with Mel.
732120	733120	Now he calls her Mel.
733120	734120	You know why?
734120	736120	He became an associate producer
736120	737120	the next the following week.
737120	738120	Like I don't,
738120	739120	like these stories where you go like,
739120	740120	you know,
740120	742120	Bruce Willis was a bartender and then he like,
742120	743120	he said,
743120	744120	uh,
744120	745120	uh,
745120	746120	come out to the coast,
746120	747120	have a few laughs while he was making a drink.
747120	748120	And someone was like,
748120	749120	say that again,
749120	751120	but now say it at an air vent.
751120	752120	Um,
752120	753120	okay.
753120	755120	Now beyond moonlighting for eight years.
755120	756120	And then,
756120	757120	uh,
757120	758120	some Seagram's gold wine coolers.
758120	759120	I'm going to,
759120	760120	I got,
760120	761120	I got,
761120	762120	I see you in an air vent baby saying that we get,
762120	763120	we get,
763120	764120	you know,
764120	765120	Hollywood is high stakes and like crazy stories.
765120	766120	And like,
766120	769120	we should just find the dude that asked him to play our Monica and stab him in
769120	770120	his face.
770120	774120	So that the guy might've been,
774120	775120	the guy might've been,
775120	778120	and then someone made the joke that was like when Justin rolled up,
778120	779120	that the guy was like,
779120	780120	yeah,
780120	784120	nice try rookie seat filler hilarious because he looked at Justin and he's
784120	785120	like,
785120	786120	yeah,
786120	787120	yeah,
787120	788120	nice.
788120	789120	And we were laughing about that.
789120	790120	But here's,
790120	791120	here's what I,
791120	792120	I swear it's rare that I,
792120	793120	I genuinely believe the crazier,
793120	794120	more art bell thing.
794120	795120	I,
795120	796120	I,
796120	797120	I,
797120	799120	I don't think that any of that stuff explains.
799120	800120	I don't,
800120	803120	I don't believe that he was a seat filler explains the thing.
803120	807120	I think that he may or may not have technically been one,
807120	809120	but more importantly,
809120	812120	he was part of a fucking crazy,
812120	816120	like weird thing that 10 years from now,
816120	820120	there'll be a Netflix documentary of not just about him.
820120	822120	It won't be like the seat stealer.
822120	823120	It'll,
823120	825120	it'll be called like seat stealers.
825120	826120	Like,
826120	827120	and it'll be about the fact that like,
827120	832120	there's like five or six people that know that the guy would,
832120	833120	and then,
833120	834120	and then everyone,
834120	835120	every,
835120	838120	every award show there's always like a big thing where like there's 60
838120	839120	people on stage.
839120	840120	I always go up for that.
840120	841120	Like,
841120	843120	he would go up because there was like this thing where they had all the
843120	846120	Star Trek people come out and they're just talking about Star Trek for like
846120	847120	what seemed like,
847120	848120	like star dates.
849120	850120	And,
850120	851120	and I was just thinking like,
851120	852120	yeah,
852120	855120	that guy could have just wandered up there and like stood next to LaVar Burton
855120	856120	and been like,
856120	857120	yeah.
857120	858120	Yeah.
858120	859120	Like,
859120	860120	like,
860120	861120	like,
861120	862120	what an art that would be,
862120	863120	but not if you did it once,
863120	865120	but if you did it 20 times over 20 years,
865120	866120	I just,
866120	867120	you just decided like,
867120	868120	I'm going to do it till I get caught.
868120	869120	And then if I get caught,
869120	870120	then I'm going to just be like,
870120	871120	see what I can do.
871120	872120	Like,
872120	873120	I'll request all the footage and I'll piece something together.
873120	874120	I just,
874120	875120	it's like,
875120	876120	like,
876120	877120	like this is art or something.
877120	878120	Like,
878120	879120	like,
879120	880120	like,
880120	881120	like,
881120	882120	like,
882120	883120	like,
883120	884120	like,
884120	885120	like,
885120	886120	like,
886120	887120	like,
887120	888120	like something real,
888120	889120	something mythical.
889120	890120	I,
890120	891120	I wish you would try that shit at the BET Awards.
895120	896120	I mean,
896120	897120	what if he did,
897120	898120	what if he did?
898120	899120	And they were like,
899120	900120	what if he came on the show and he was like,
900120	901120	yeah,
901120	902120	oh yeah,
902120	903120	nice.
903120	904120	Like roll a clip.
904120	905120	And I was like,
905120	906120	all the more.
906120	907120	And I was like,
907120	908120	like,
908120	909120	like,
909120	910120	like a white dude there.
910120	911120	And there's like little navy blue coat.
911120	912120	Like,
912120	913120	of course.
913120	914120	Anyway,
914120	915120	it just makes sense to everybody.
915120	916120	It's just like this Zellig,
916120	917120	you know,
917120	918120	thing.
918120	919120	Yeah.
919120	920120	I,
920120	921120	he,
921120	922120	that guy,
922120	923120	boy,
923120	924120	he did not want to stop filling that seat.
924120	925120	Yeah.
925120	926120	And I think that he fascinates you because you have a thing,
926120	927120	perhaps,
927120	928120	as I do,
928120	929120	which is,
929120	930120	you wonder how someone takes the,
930120	931120	they get those balls.
931120	933120	How do you get the balls to sit there?
933120	934120	And enter,
934120	935120	you know,
935120	936120	they get thrown out.
936120	937120	Yeah.
937120	938120	But that you might surf.
938120	939120	And then entwines with your fraud complex,
939120	940120	which is like,
940120	941120	oh,
941120	942120	you know,
942120	943120	why am I better than a seat filler?
943120	944120	The,
944120	945120	you know,
945120	946120	of course you're going to,
946120	947120	your mind's going to go there when it's like that.
947120	949120	We like any place where there's classes in imputed,
949120	950120	whatever.
950120	951120	That's not the word.
951120	952120	Implyed.
952120	953120	Um,
953120	955120	like your head immediately goes out.
955120	956120	What,
956120	957120	what am I doing here?
957120	958120	What am I?
958120	959120	And then,
959120	960120	so then you think,
960120	961120	and then that,
961120	962120	yeah,
962120	963120	I,
963120	964120	it's both of those things.
964120	965120	How can you fucking,
965120	966120	so if you got,
966120	967120	if you,
967120	968120	if you were like,
968120	969120	would I,
969120	970120	would I?
970120	971120	And didn't I?
971120	972120	Yeah.
972120	973120	I did.
973120	974120	Yeah.
974120	975120	That's all I did.
975120	977120	It's just fill the seat.
977120	978120	Also,
978120	979120	you,
979120	980120	you do,
980120	981120	you kind of,
981120	982120	it resets you.
982120	983120	Like you said,
983120	984120	you go,
984120	985120	Jesus Christ,
985120	986120	we're in the same space right now.
986120	987120	Yours is a fraud.
987120	988120	And that you're not supposed to be here.
988120	989120	So is mine.
989120	990120	And so is mine.
990120	991120	Yeah.
991120	992120	And you got,
992120	993120	and you have like some like,
993120	994120	I'm going to give you this,
994120	996120	my dead father's watch.
996120	997120	Sure.
997120	999120	When it stops ticking,
999120	1001120	you and I trade back.
1001120	1002120	Or whatever.
1002120	1005120	Just like sliding doors thing or like,
1005120	1007120	I keep filling the seat or,
1007120	1009120	or like Donald Sutherland comes down
1009120	1011120	with a popcorn cart and he's like,
1011120	1012120	like,
1012120	1014120	there's like a seat filler coupon,
1014120	1015120	but it's magic.
1015120	1016120	And like,
1016120	1017120	so like,
1017120	1019120	and I'm like being obnoxious and doing coke
1019120	1020120	and going like,
1020120	1021120	at least I'm not a seat filler.
1021120	1022120	I'll tell you what,
1022120	1023120	I wish,
1027120	1028120	I wish,
1028120	1030120	I wish I could fill his seat just to show him
1030120	1032120	how much more I do with it.
1034120	1035120	You know,
1035120	1036120	Sutherland popcorn.
1036120	1037120	Uh,
1037120	1038120	here you go.
1038120	1039120	I'm from Maine.
1039120	1040120	It's lightning.
1048120	1051120	Are you referencing the Marcia Mason movie?
1051120	1052120	I don't know.
1052120	1053120	I don't know what movie I'm.
1053120	1054120	Uh,
1054120	1056120	it's the Jason Robarts comes to town.
1056120	1057120	Oh,
1057120	1058120	well,
1058120	1059120	Jason wrote,
1059120	1060120	do you mean dream a little dream?
1060120	1061120	Was that what it was called?
1061120	1062120	No, it's this,
1062120	1063120	uh,
1063120	1064120	it's a single mother.
1064120	1065120	She's got a son.
1065120	1066120	Oh,
1066120	1067120	Mr. Dynamite or something like that.
1067120	1068120	Mr. Dynamite.
1068120	1069120	Fantastic.
1069120	1070120	He comes to town and he changes his
1070120	1071120	woman's life.
1071120	1072120	He's a millionaire.
1072120	1073120	It's ages old,
1073120	1074120	but it's very similar.
1074120	1075120	Oh,
1075120	1076120	no,
1076120	1077120	I don't,
1077120	1078120	I'm not familiar with this.
1078120	1079120	I thought you were talking about,
1079120	1080120	like,
1081120	1083120	no, but apparently a lot of movies share the
1083120	1084120	same plot.
1084120	1085120	Yeah.
1085120	1086120	Yeah.
1086120	1087120	Yeah.
1087120	1088120	Magic abounds.

1162120	1163120	Oh,
1163120	1164120	press Roundup or whatever.
1164120	1165120	And they even vet them for like,
1165120	1166120	you know,
1166120	1167120	they're not going to like,

1202120	1203120	And then you're like,
1203120	1204120	well,
1204120	1205120	how would he do?
1205120	1206120	You know,
1206120	1207120	come out with a fucking story about a bear or something,
1207120	1208120	or come out,
1208120	1209120	make yourself at home and chill.
1209120	1210120	And I'm,
1210120	1211120	I'm not going to tell my thing about my,
1211120	1213120	the thing I got in my phone.
1213120	1215120	That's another way to do it.
1215120	1216120	Oh,
1216120	1218120	you want me to ask you like,
1218120	1219120	Oh,
1219120	1220120	what's been going on?
1220120	1222120	Like a host of a show?
1222120	1223120	What?
1223120	1224120	No.
1224120	1234120	Just invite somebody out to have them sit and watch you talk.
1234120	1235120	All right.
1235120	1236120	Now let's bill out,
1236120	1238120	bring out Bill Johnson.
1238120	1239120	All right,
1239120	1240120	Bill Johnson,
1240120	1241120	sit down.
1241120	1242120	So anyway,
1242120	1243120	I was eating a sandwich.
1243120	1245120	This sandwich is fucking great.
1245120	1246120	I was eating this.
1246120	1247120	Bill Johnson is going,
1247120	1248120	why did,
1248120	1250120	why did I even leave the house?
1250120	1252120	Why did I come here?
1252120	1254120	I don't understand.
1254120	1255120	All right.
1255120	1256120	Well,
1256120	1259120	what's new with you?
1259120	1263120	And it better be fucking amazing.
1263120	1265120	Vape adventures.
1265120	1266120	Oh, okay.
1266120	1268120	I'm into vapes now as.
1268120	1269120	Did you,
1269120	1270120	did you and Spencer,
1270120	1273120	Spencer and I went on a vape adventure.
1273120	1276120	And it vapes your.
1276120	1281120	Spencer vape adventure.
1281120	1284120	So hashtag vape culture,
1284120	1287120	vape culture.
1287120	1288120	Okay.
1288120	1289120	All right.
1289120	1291120	I thought,
1291120	1293120	I thought it through in my head.
1293120	1296120	I categorized it as not technically a rape joke,
1296120	1299120	but the customer is always right.
1299120	1301120	And let's,
1301120	1303120	let's keep communicating like that.
1303120	1304120	And I'm fine with it.
1304120	1305120	If you are,
1305120	1307120	I bet it.
1307120	1310120	I did not want to hurt anybody.
1310120	1314120	The public has spoken rhyming counts and I didn't know it.
1314120	1317120	And I will not make the same mistake again.
1317120	1318120	That,
1318120	1319120	that,
1319120	1320120	you know,
1320120	1325120	we're a couple of years away from that being on a poster of some Dreamworks.
1325120	1327120	Like a meme.
1327120	1328120	Yeah.
1328120	1329120	Well,
1329120	1330120	yeah.

1331120	1332120	Oh,
1332120	1333120	I didn't know that.
1333120	1334120	I mean,
1334120	1335120	yeah,
1335120	1336120	like,
1336120	1337120	okay.
1337120	1338120	And we're going to be going,
1338120	1339120	oh,
1339120	1340120	that sounds familiar.

1343120	1344120	Mommy,

1388120	1389120	They got it all hanging out.
1389120	1390120	You should go there.
1390120	1391120	You should go.
1391120	1392120	Well,
1392120	1394120	it's pretty cool.

1395120	1397120	You got that hanging on wall.
1397120	1398120	You know,
1398120	1401120	they might give you some free shit.
1401120	1403120	Might give you some free shit.
1403120	1404120	Oh,
1404120	1407120	I got the one in me.
1407120	1408120	Pretty cool.
1408120	1410120	You got that on the wall.
1410120	1412120	He's doing a good face.
1412120	1413120	Pretty cool.
1413120	1415120	You got it on the wall.
1415120	1418120	I just want you to deal with that a little bit.
1418120	1421120	Why is the Elvis face he's making?
1421120	1422120	So anyway,
1422120	1426120	we go in there and they set me up with vape.
1426120	1428120	They said Kate and I up with some good vapes.
1428120	1429120	We got some good vapes.
1429120	1431120	Like we got two different brands.
1431120	1432120	We got,
1432120	1433120	or not flavors.
1433120	1434120	What are they called?
1434120	1435120	Uh,
1435120	1436120	well,
1436120	1440120	there's different like varieties of weed that are called brands.
1440120	1441120	Okay.
1441120	1443120	So we've got two different brands.
1443120	1445120	Go home and Spencer is like,
1445120	1446120	all right,
1446120	1447120	this is how you do it.
1447120	1448120	And he said,
1448120	1449120	he told us how to put the battery in thing.
1449120	1450120	He's squeezing in there.
1450120	1451120	And I'm like,
1451120	1452120	I got what?
1452120	1453120	Chocolate.
1453120	1454120	What did I get?
1454120	1455120	I think you got chocolate.
1455120	1456120	I got a lot or something.
1456120	1457120	Chocolate,
1457120	1458120	chocolate,
1458120	1459120	chocolate,
1459120	1460120	chocolate.
1460120	1461120	Was it?
1461120	1462120	I do this.
1462120	1463120	I go,
1463120	1464120	I go.
1464120	1465120	Okay.
1465120	1466120	So what is it?
1466120	1467120	Got a button.
1467120	1468120	No,
1468120	1469120	I think you can just,
1469120	1470120	you can just like,
1470120	1471120	you know,
1471120	1472120	you know,
1472120	1473120	suck on it.
1473120	1474120	Oh God.
1474120	1475120	Sorry.
1475120	1476120	Everybody give him a second.
1476120	1477120	He did.
1477120	1478120	Because you know what else you suck out is ticks and titties.
1478120	1480120	All manner of hilarious things.
1480120	1481120	So I go,
1481120	1482120	okay,
1482120	1483120	so how do you do it?
1483120	1484120	Just like,
1484120	1485120	anyway.
1485120	1487120	Because I was trying to make.
1487120	1489120	I wasn't paying attention while he was doing it.
1489120	1490120	The light goes.
1490120	1491120	Right.
1491120	1493120	And you can't see the light because it's down the pipe.
1493120	1494120	I didn't see it right away.
1494120	1495120	So I did it.
1495120	1496120	So,
1496120	1497120	so anyway,
1497120	1498120	Spencer turns around and goes,
1498120	1499120	wow,
1499120	1500120	that was,
1500120	1501120	whoa,
1501120	1502120	boy,
1502120	1503120	you took a big hit there.
1503120	1504120	And then I was like,
1504120	1505120	yeah,
1505120	1506120	the thing you got to know is like the big hits,
1506120	1507120	which is not,
1507120	1509120	not to hit it like that at first.
1509120	1510120	Okay.
1510120	1511120	Don't do that.
1511120	1512120	So I'm like,
1512120	1513120	I don't really feel anything.
1513120	1514120	And then I go,
1514120	1515120	Kate,
1515120	1516120	we got to go to cryotherapy right now.
1516120	1517120	Cryotherapy.
1517120	1518120	Cry,
1518120	1519120	is it,
1519120	1520120	am I pronouncing it right?
1520120	1521120	No,
1521120	1522120	cryotherapy.
1522120	1523120	Flash frozen.
1523120	1524120	So this is,
1524120	1525120	this is,
1525120	1526120	why did you want to get flash frozen?
1526120	1527120	I think you should take it.
1527120	1528120	First of all,
1528120	1529120	are you for real?
1529120	1530120	Did you go to cryotherapy?
1530120	1531120	What?
1531120	1532120	Cause you got too high.
1532120	1533120	Yeah.
1533120	1534120	Well,
1534120	1535120	so second of all,
1535120	1536120	then now you have to stop and explain,
1536120	1537120	not for high volume.
1537120	1538120	He was going to go anyway.
1538120	1539120	Everybody.
1539120	1540120	Well,
1540120	1541120	we were talking about it for a long time.
1541120	1542120	We kept like,
1542120	1543120	we were going to do,
1543120	1544120	I had the whole day.
1544120	1545120	Just tell him what cryotherapy is.
1545120	1546120	Cryotherapy is something that Joel Hodson told me about.
1546120	1547120	He went on,
1547120	1548120	like,
1548120	1549120	I don't know.
1549120	1550120	I don't know.
1550120	1551120	I don't know.
1551120	1552120	I don't know.
1552120	1553120	I don't know.
1553120	1554120	I don't know.
1554120	1555120	I don't know.
1555120	1556120	I don't know.
1556120	1557120	I don't know.
1557120	1558120	He went on,
1558120	1561120	like when we were doing mystery science theater this summer,
1561120	1562120	like after every shoot,
1562120	1563120	he would go,
1563120	1564120	Hey man,
1564120	1565120	you want to do some cryotherapy?
1565120	1566120	Man,
1566120	1567120	it's pretty cool.
1567120	1568120	You should check it out.
1568120	1569120	It's good for your skin.
1569120	1570120	Help my back.
1570120	1573120	I get frozen while some crazy movies play it
1573120	1575120	and have some kind of stuff to say about it.
1575120	1576120	You got to do it, man.
1576120	1577120	It's the best.
1577120	1578120	You know?
1578120	1579120	And so,
1579120	1580120	so I,
1580120	1581120	I never did it,
1581120	1582120	but I,
1582120	1583120	I always wanted to try it.
1583120	1584120	And then,
1584120	1585120	and the thing that I go,
1585120	1586120	so what do you do?
1586120	1587120	Well,
1587120	1594120	you go into this like shower sized room that is like,
1594120	1599120	like lots of degrees below zero.
1599120	1603120	And you go in there for three minutes and you do jumping jacks and you get it.
1603120	1604120	And what it does is they get,
1604120	1610120	it makes your body go into this fight or flight mode where everything is on deck
1610120	1611120	going, Jesus Christ,
1611120	1612120	what are you doing?
1612120	1613120	This is,
1613120	1614120	you're trying to kill yourself.
1614120	1615120	This is stupid.
1615120	1618120	And it's supposed to like bring supposed to,
1618120	1619120	you know,
1619120	1620120	be good for your skin,
1620120	1623120	but mostly wake you up and sleep at night.
1623120	1624120	Yeah.
1624120	1625120	Yeah.
1625120	1626120	I know.
1626120	1627120	I know.
1627120	1628120	I know.
1628120	1629120	It's probably stupid.
1629120	1630120	But anyway,
1630120	1631120	how much,
1631120	1632120	how much?
1632120	1633120	I don't know.
1633120	1634120	I don't know.
1634120	1635120	How much?
1635120	1636120	I don't know.
1636120	1637120	Kate did it online.
1637120	1638120	How much?
1638120	1641120	Kate did it online.
1641120	1642120	What's the,
1642120	1648120	what's the number that would make you then not go white people?
1648120	1649120	What's it?
1649120	1650120	If it was $7,
1650120	1651120	would you be like,
1651120	1652120	all right,
1652120	1653120	okay.
1653120	1654120	Fine.
1654120	1655120	Seven dollars.
1655120	1656120	I'm like,
1656120	1657120	freeze me for $7.
1657120	1658120	It's still,
1658120	1659120	it wasn't $7.
1659120	1660120	It's still,
1660120	1663120	it's always going to be white people just walking into a shower.
1663120	1665120	Where's cold white people,
1665120	1667120	some shit you have in your house.
1667120	1668120	But that part,
1668120	1672120	but I do believe that it is probably one of those things where it's like,
1672120	1674120	it's a thousand dollars.
1674120	1675120	I mean,
1675120	1677120	it can't be because if it's $30,
1677120	1679120	you wouldn't do it.
1679120	1680120	Right?
1680120	1681120	Like you can't,
1681120	1682120	you don't freeze your body.
1682120	1684120	Even if it only caused them a nickel,
1684120	1688120	they'd make more money if they charged $90 than 30 because it wasn't 30.
1688120	1689120	It's like,
1689120	1694120	I'm not going to have you freeze my body for the price of a transformer.
1694120	1695120	What,
1695120	1697120	how much was it?
1697120	1698120	I don't.
1698120	1699120	I didn't set it up.
1699120	1700120	$179.
1700120	1701120	I was fucking,
1701120	1702120	I was.
1702120	1703120	That's my.
1703120	1705120	My guess is $179.
1705120	1706120	All right.
1706120	1707120	Okay.
1707120	1708120	But there's,
1708120	1709120	and there's specials for couples and whatever.
1709120	1710120	So anyway,
1710120	1711120	Joe,
1711120	1712120	Joe,
1712120	1713120	Joe is telling me,
1713120	1714120	you do this,
1714120	1715120	you do this,
1715120	1716120	man,
1716120	1717120	you do,
1717120	1718120	and they play music and you dance around there if you want.
1718120	1719120	And I go,
1719120	1720120	do you get to pick the music?
1720120	1721120	Yeah.
1721120	1723120	What song did you,
1723120	1724120	did you play,
1724120	1725120	Joel?
1725120	1726120	Tell me.
1726120	1727120	It's not at all bashful.
1727120	1728120	And he goes,
1728120	1731120	do you believe in life after love by,
1731120	1732120	by Cher?
1732120	1736120	Because Joel's a huge Cher fan,
1736120	1737120	as we know.
1737120	1738120	We're like,
1738120	1739120	he loves Cher.
1739120	1740120	Like not ironically.
1740120	1741120	I didn't know.
1741120	1742120	I learned from this.
1742120	1743120	Yeah.
1743120	1744120	Well,
1744120	1745120	he,
1745120	1746120	he goes to share a concert.
1746120	1747120	It's,
1747120	1748120	it's,
1748120	1749120	it's amazing.
1749120	1750120	So I go,
1750120	1751120	Kate and I'm like,
1751120	1752120	so we go there.
1752120	1753120	70 bucks.
1753120	1754120	Is it 70?
1754120	1755120	70 bucks.
1755120	1756120	Come on.
1756120	1761120	It's like 30 bucks.
1761120	1764120	I'll rub ice on your head.
1764120	1765120	I'll make,
1765120	1768120	I'll make you feel things and come back.
1768120	1769120	Deal.
1769120	1770120	Deal.
1770120	1771120	So anyway,
1771120	1772120	we,
1772120	1773120	because we're a couple,
1773120	1774120	we can both go in the,
1774120	1777120	into the chamber at the same time and they go,
1777120	1778120	okay.
1778120	1779120	All right.
1779120	1784120	Mr. Scrab and Kate friend,
1784120	1785120	whatever, you know,
1785120	1786120	we're standing in our underwear,
1786120	1787120	you know,
1787120	1789120	like getting ready to freeze ourselves to death.
1789120	1790120	And,
1790120	1791120	and they,
1791120	1792120	and he says,
1792120	1794120	what music do you want to listen to?
1794120	1795120	And Kate goes,
1795120	1797120	money for nothing.
1797120	1800120	And I'm like,
1800120	1801120	no,
1801120	1802120	no,
1802120	1803120	we have to do,
1803120	1806120	do you believe in life after love by Cher?
1806120	1807120	Oh,
1807120	1808120	come on.
1808120	1809120	She's like,
1809120	1810120	all right.
1810120	1811120	Sure.
1811120	1812120	Fine.
1812120	1813120	I'm like,
1813120	1814120	do you just share a thing?
1814120	1815120	Yeah.
1815120	1816120	Because we're a couple,
1816120	1817120	we can do that.
1817120	1818120	Okay.
1818120	1819120	You and I can do it next.
1819120	1820120	Okay.
1820120	1821120	All right.
1821120	1822120	And so we go in there and the guy goes,
1822120	1823120	yeah,
1823120	1824120	we can play that song.
1824120	1825120	We got an apple,
1825120	1826120	whatever.
1826120	1827120	We put it on,
1827120	1828120	it goes,
1828120	1829120	and it's freezing.
1829120	1832120	And you remember being in Wisconsin where you're like,
1832120	1833120	ah,
1833120	1834120	I got to throw out this.
1834120	1835120	I got to let the dog in,
1835120	1836120	whatever.
1836120	1840120	I'm too lazy to put on a jacket or,
1840120	1842120	or a hat or whatever.
1842120	1845120	It's like that feeling.
1845120	1846120	I remember it totally.
1846120	1847120	And it goes,
1847120	1849120	and it's freezing.
1849120	1854120	So the music comes on and it's the wrong song.
1854120	1856120	So everybody I'm assuming knows,
1856120	1860120	do you believe in life after love after love?
1860120	1861120	Good song.
1861120	1865120	Good song to jump around like an idiot so you don't freeze to death.
1865120	1866120	Instead they play,
1866120	1867120	what's the song?
1867120	1868120	I wrote it down.
1868120	1869120	After all,
1869120	1872120	by Sharon Peter Satera,
1872120	1874120	which is this love ballad.
1874120	1876120	After all,
1876120	1879120	after all that we've been through,
1879120	1880120	it's just this,
1880120	1883120	I will back it up to you.
1883120	1885120	And we're both going,
1885120	1886120	God,
1886120	1887120	God damn it.
1887120	1888120	Wrong song.
1888120	1890120	Banging on the glass.
1890120	1891120	Wrong song.
1891120	1893120	And the guy's like,
1893120	1895120	he's like,
1895120	1896120	he's like a carny.
1896120	1897120	He's just like in a booth.
1897120	1899120	I didn't know there was a guy,
1899120	1900120	he could see you.
1900120	1903120	You want to go colder?
1903120	1904120	It's pretty,
1904120	1905120	it's pretty close to that.
1905120	1907120	Do you all have to get naked for this?
1907120	1908120	No, no, no,
1908120	1909120	but I'm in my underwear.
1909120	1910120	We're both in my underwear.
1910120	1911120	But you're not wearing pants.
1911120	1912120	Yeah.
1912120	1913120	I mean, you're in your unders.
1913120	1914120	That's not naked.
1914120	1915120	I know,
1915120	1922120	but the important answer to your question is this is a ridiculous situation.
1922120	1923120	And it's much,
1923120	1926120	it's much more than a lot of us could get paid $70 to do.
1926120	1927120	I don't,
1927120	1928120	I'm not trying to high road this.
1928120	1931120	I don't want to be one of these practical guys.
1931120	1934120	It's like $70 to be cold.
1934120	1936120	I'm not going to be that guy.
1936120	1937120	Don't.
1937120	1938120	I'm not.
1938120	1939120	You're not allowed.
1939120	1940120	I do crazy.
1940120	1941120	You're not allowed.
1941120	1951120	I pay $70 to simulate living in a post-apocalyptic place in Boston
1951120	1956120	where I spend nine hours a night sorting my living room.
1956120	1959120	I'll pay for the high resolution pack of a video game
1959120	1961120	just so the cupboards can look better
1961120	1965120	as I'm figuring out where to put my duct tape.
1965120	1968120	And my fucking house is falling apart around me.
1968120	1969120	Somebody's like,
1969120	1972120	did you put an orange Julius on the dog's head?
1972120	1973120	Yeah, I don't care about life.
1973120	1977120	I'm trying to sort my fallout apartment.
1977120	1978120	Anyways, continue.
1978120	1979120	I just wanted to interject it
1979120	1983120	with a little bit of what the people really want, which is moi.
1983120	1985120	You know, no matter how much you delude yourself,
1985120	1989120	you know you still got a little bit of me in there.
1989120	1990120	Yeah.
1990120	1991120	Keep going.
1991120	1992120	Keep going.
1992120	1993120	They got what they need.
1993120	1994120	Keep going.
1994120	2001120	Okay, so the fucking computer system goes three minutes left.
2001120	2004120	And you're like, oh, fuck you.
2004120	2005120	Three minutes?
2005120	2007120	And we're screaming, fuck you.
2007120	2008120	Wrong song.
2008120	2011120	Kate and I are both going, wrong fucking song.
2011120	2012120	I fucking hate this song.
2012120	2016120	This song made it last like it was eight minutes late.
2016120	2017120	It was slow.
2017120	2019120	I mean, at least with an uptempo song,
2019120	2022120	it would feel shorter.
2022120	2023120	It didn't.
2023120	2024120	This was awful.
2024120	2027120	And then we get out and we go, wrong song.
2027120	2029120	Oh, all right.
2029120	2033120	You know, did you just press like any share song at random?
2033120	2035120	It doesn't work that way.
2035120	2037120	You can get out.
2037120	2038120	Did he say?
2038120	2039120	Yeah.
2039120	2040120	Were you locked inside?
2040120	2041120	That sounds terrifying.
2041120	2042120	No, I wasn't locked, but we committed to it.
2042120	2043120	Okay, sure.
2043120	2046120	And, and, and.
2046120	2048120	This motherfucker deserved it.
2048120	2050120	And I deserved it.
2050120	2053120	Did he say that he would make it up to you?
2053120	2054120	No.
2054120	2056120	He didn't promise to.
2056120	2065120	I mean, after all that you'd been through.
2065120	2067120	Yeah.
2067120	2069120	I don't even remember that song.
2069120	2071120	I don't know that song at all.
2071120	2075120	And I love Peter Cetera.
2075120	2076120	I'll play it.
2076120	2078120	I'll play it for you later.
2078120	2081120	And, but anyway, do this whole thing.
2081120	2085120	I'm still stoned AF motherfucker.
2085120	2087120	I am stoned as fuck.
2087120	2088120	I'm just like going,
2088120	2093120	I would think this freezing cold sensation would sober me up,
2093120	2096120	but I was fucked up all day.
2096120	2097120	After we lived, I'd go,
2097120	2101120	Hey, let's go to this restaurant that's right next door.
2101120	2104120	And we, we drove over there.
2104120	2105120	We got to order all this food.
2105120	2107120	I just kept eating, eating, eating.
2107120	2108120	Okay.
2108120	2111120	It's like, you're just so, you're such a cliche of shaggy.
2111120	2113120	What are you doing?
2113120	2117120	Then I went home and then I had to take the dog.
2117120	2119120	I don't remember half the day.
2119120	2122120	I remember doing this a lot on the couch,
2122120	2123120	just laying there.
2123120	2128120	And then I go to take Lolly to the dog groomer to wash the dog.
2128120	2130120	She's got shit on her butt.
2130120	2132120	And so I take, take the dog over there.
2132120	2134120	And then I was like, I,
2134120	2136120	as close as where Steve Agee lives.
2136120	2137120	So I go to Steve Agee.
2137120	2138120	I said, Hey, can I hang out?
2138120	2141120	Well, my dog's getting her ass washed.
2141120	2142120	If I bring a bunch of ice cream,
2142120	2148120	I bring a bunch of ice cream over to Steve Agee's house.
2148120	2150120	And he was watching the twilight zone.
2150120	2156120	I ate like a whole tub of ice cream, talked over the twilight zone.
2156120	2158120	He was trying to record a podcast.
2158120	2160120	And then I was like going, Hey, my dog's done.
2160120	2161120	Talk to you later.
2161120	2163120	I don't think he said anything.
2163120	2165120	And I just left and I'm just.
2165120	2170120	And then I was like, did I come over by your house yesterday?
2170120	2173120	Talk over your television show and eat ice cream.
2173120	2175120	Yeah. Yeah. You did all of that.
2175120	2176120	Yeah. A lot of people,
2176120	2178120	I'm glad you're not then moving on to try to convince people that
2178120	2180120	you're not having the best life in the world.
2180120	2181120	That's not, I'm sure.
2181120	2182120	I had a fantastic day.
2182120	2184120	I think I would like to spend the day doing that.
2184120	2186120	It was, it was, it was quite good.
2186120	2194120	I, I, I, I almost went to do VR, like, uh, Star Wars VR.
2194120	2196120	You hear about this void.
2196120	2197120	Yeah.
2197120	2198120	Oh, okay.
2198120	2202120	Let me tell you something.
2202120	2205120	Uh, did you look at, he came out with notes,
2205120	2209120	like a, like an alternative comic in San Francisco.
2209120	2212120	He's got, he's got a whole notepad.
2212120	2215120	Here's another question.
2215120	2217120	Here's a question.
2217120	2219120	Okay.
2219120	2220120	All right.
2220120	2225120	So, you know, I was watching this movie with Kate and it,
2225120	2228120	it was like this British movie came out last year.
2228120	2232120	It's like these two old people falling in love and learning how to dance
2232120	2233120	and doing a whatever.
2233120	2236120	I know it sounds right up your alley.
2236120	2237120	And, uh, the end of the bus.
2237120	2240120	I love feelings.
2240120	2242120	Anyway, it was, it was sweet.
2242120	2243120	It was cheesy or whatever.
2243120	2247120	And I was like thinking like, well, there's like this demographic,
2247120	2252120	this about Schmidt bucket list, Morgan Freeman, you know,
2252120	2258120	Alan Arkin, like they, you know, it's like the Matlock of movies or whatever
2258120	2262120	where they go, we're going to go, okay, we're targeting these baby boomers
2262120	2263120	or whatever.
2263120	2264120	You know what I'm talking about.
2264120	2265120	Yes.
2265120	2269120	It's the, it's the, uh, something's got to give the, uh, what's,
2269120	2271120	what's with your, what's with your croissant?
2271120	2272120	Yeah.
2272120	2277120	I'm kind of like, uh, Mickey, Mickey Oldman and, uh, he wears a sweater,
2277120	2280120	Johnson are, you know, but it's like people that we remember as Ghostbusters
2280120	2281120	and stuff.
2281120	2282120	Yeah.
2282120	2283120	Yeah.
2283120	2286120	Because our arteries are slowly.
2286120	2290120	My question to you as a writer and a producer of various things,
2290120	2295120	do you think that when our generation hits that,
2295120	2300120	are there going to be more, like more like sci-fi, you know,
2300120	2304120	fantasy stuff featuring old people or do we just get you?
2304120	2309120	Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie are fighting an insect monster.
2309120	2310120	Yeah.
2310120	2315120	But they're like, like good walkers because it reminds us of a simpler time.
2315120	2317120	This is kind of back to the future.
2317120	2319120	Just shoot him with the ray gun.
2319120	2320120	God damn it.
2320120	2322120	Well, do you love me or not?
2322120	2323120	I don't know.
2323120	2324120	We grew up friends.
2324120	2325120	Choo, choo, choo, choo.
2325120	2331120	All I want to do is see my grandchildren on Easter.
2331120	2337120	Oh, well, Jesus, it's Jesus.
2337120	2339120	It's not very sci-fi, but.
2339120	2347120	How about Kevin Hart in How We Gonna Get Back To Earth?
2347120	2352120	Or when I was your age, Earth was uphill, you know,
2352120	2355120	because it'll be more about it'll be more like, are we there yet?
2355120	2359120	You know, that sounds like that could come out tomorrow.
2359120	2364120	Is there like a whole series of how we're going to get back to blanks?
2364120	2368120	Tiffany Haddish has How We Gonna Get Back To Mars?
2368120	2371120	How are we going to get back to the Kevin Hart series?
2371120	2376120	Kevin Hart 70, and it's like, how are we going to get back to blank series?
2376120	2381120	And then it gets to the point where it's so over-saturated that the movies
2381120	2390120	have to start becoming like, how are we going to get back to in Meet Jason Voorhees?
2390120	2391120	I don't know.
2391120	2394120	I was trying to think of an example.
2394120	2399120	I wish when we were making First Blood,
2399120	2402120	we had known that we were just making a franchise called Rambo.
2402120	2405120	We made this so confusing.
2405120	2410120	What do you mean, Rambo colon First Blood Part 2?
2410120	2411120	That's so confusing.
2411120	2413120	What are we going to call the third movie?
2413120	2414120	I got an idea.
2414120	2417120	Yes, Mr. S?
2417120	2418120	Rambo 3.
2418120	2420120	Okay, fine.
2421120	2422120	Our point is...
2422120	2425120	Your point is, make a third movie.
2427120	2430120	First Blood Part 2?
2430120	2434120	We could call it Second Blood and just get rid of the last...
2434120	2437120	We could call it The Bloodning and just sort of keep it going.
2437120	2438120	More blood.
2438120	2439120	Call it Second Blood.
2439120	2440120	More blood.
2440120	2441120	First Blood?
2441120	2442120	Call it First Blood, Second Blood, Third Blood.
2442120	2444120	You know, they would fucking die for an opportunity to do that.
2444120	2446120	They'd make so much money if they would have done that.
2446120	2448120	Oh, god damn it.
2448120	2449120	I'm sorry.
2449120	2451120	I hate that you've taken on this role.
2451120	2452120	No, I don't.
2452120	2453120	I love it.
2453120	2455120	I love it because I love irony.
2455120	2458120	I love watching you turn into your mother.
2462120	2465120	After all of these years of friendship, we were like...
2465120	2467120	We bonded, our original bonding was like...
2467120	2470120	You know, we bonded over the fact that we were raised in a culture of,
2470120	2473120	oh, you're in Milwaukee and you got your pacifier in your mouth
2473120	2475120	and you look at a Wrigley's billboard and you're like,
2475120	2479120	how come the billboard makes it look like a gum's a bad idea?
2479120	2482120	And your parents go like, you're talking about it.
2482120	2484120	And we bonded about it.
2484120	2485120	We're like, yeah, man.
2485120	2487120	And then to get out here and make stuff...
2487120	2488120	And now, look at you, man.
2488120	2490120	You're fucking Saramon.
2492120	2494120	And I'm Gandalf the White.
2494120	2496120	Damn.
2496120	2498120	And I'll tell you what, man.
2498120	2500120	Put me on the roof of your tower.
2500120	2504120	And leave me up there forever while you make new kinds of goblins.
2504120	2506120	And then...
2506120	2509120	I hope you visit me every once in a while.
2509120	2511120	But I'll tell you what, man.
2511120	2513120	There's moths everywhere.
2513120	2515120	And they talk to eagles.
2515120	2517120	And I will get out of here.
2517120	2520120	Because you should have just killed me.
2520120	2522120	Don't hate the wizard.
2522120	2524120	Hate the weird fucking rules.
2524120	2525120	Yep, yep.
2525120	2527120	Everybody's against you.
2527120	2529120	I know.
2529120	2530120	I get it.
2530120	2531120	It's pretty bad.
2531120	2532120	You know that's you.
2532120	2534120	You know that guy's you.
2534120	2535120	When Gandalf goes...
2535120	2538120	When you watched Lord of the Rings, we never talked about it.
2538120	2540120	Because we watched Crumpy Old Men.
2540120	2542120	We're like, oh, that's you and that's me.
2542120	2544120	Like, when we watched American Splendor,
2544120	2546120	we knew that you were crumb.
2546120	2548120	And I was the Harvey P. Carr.
2548120	2550120	We were like, okay, that's us, yeah.
2550120	2553120	And then, you know, we never checked in.
2553120	2555120	We never called each other Lord of the Rings and go,
2555120	2556120	come on, you're Saramon.
2556120	2558120	Like, when fucking Gandalf rides up,
2558120	2560120	he's like, I'm gonna go...
2561120	2564120	Don't let me touch that ring.
2564120	2565120	It's so powerful.
2565120	2568120	I'm gonna go talk to my friend Saramon about it.
2568120	2570120	He's the best friend I've ever had.
2570120	2572120	I've never trusted anyone in my life.
2572120	2574120	Don't let me touch that ring.
2574120	2576120	I'm so smart about this shit.
2576120	2579120	I'm gonna go to the library, look up a couple things.
2579120	2581120	I'm gonna go see my roommate from college.
2581120	2583120	I'll tell him everything.
2583120	2585120	I never trusted anybody more in my life.
2585120	2586120	I'm just...
2586120	2588120	I live on a different plane where I know about everything.
2588120	2590120	And it's you...
2590120	2591120	Yeah.
2591120	2592120	And you're like, look into the crystal ball.
2592120	2593120	What do you see?
2593120	2596120	And I was like, I see it all, because I'm fucking...
2596120	2598120	Yeah, that's you.
2598120	2601120	I saw that guy and I was like, that's Shrob.
2604120	2606120	And I'm the only one that sees it.
2606120	2608120	Nobody looks at me and goes, that's Gandalf.
2608120	2610120	But I am like...
2610120	2613120	The self-structiveness, you shall not pass.
2613120	2614120	Who does that?
2614120	2615120	Somebody that hates himself.
2615120	2616120	He knows that's a ballrog.
2616120	2617120	He knows he's gonna die.
2617120	2619120	But he doesn't care, because he's like, fuck it.
2619120	2620120	You know what?
2620120	2621120	People will feel sorry for me.
2621120	2624120	I'll probably come back to life anyway.
2624120	2625120	I get that.
2625120	2627120	Listen, white dudes say they love each other.
2627120	2629120	And the way he said fly you fools
2629120	2633120	so that people would spend a year trying to figure out what he said.
2633120	2635120	Because we're like, what?
2635120	2636120	Fly you fool?
2636120	2637120	What?
2637120	2638120	What did he say?
2638120	2641120	Like, you got to buy like special shit to know what he said.
2641120	2643120	That's what I'm doing.
2643120	2645120	You got to buy closed cabs.
2645120	2646120	Yeah.
2647120	2649120	But at the root of all that, you're basically saying,
2649120	2651120	I love you, dawg.
2651120	2652120	Nah, dude.
2652120	2653120	Well, I mean, look.
2653120	2657120	Because you went way too deep on that for somebody who's not in love.
2658120	2661120	You can keep chipping away at this theory that I love, Rob.
2661120	2663120	Like, people like to do that.
2663120	2665120	This theory!
2667120	2672120	This concept that you've been coming up with.
2672120	2673120	Now, Rob.
2673120	2674120	Chuck Borden.
2674120	2677120	Do you have anything nice to say to your brother?
2677120	2679120	That's not what this show's about.
2679120	2681120	It's not what this show's about.
2682120	2684120	I don't want to share this anymore.
2684120	2685120	I thought this was funny.
2685120	2687120	Can I ask you a quick question?
2688120	2692120	That everyone is probably, did you call?
2694120	2698120	Oh, I texted my parents.
2698120	2699120	Oh.
2702120	2705120	You don't know this, but three people in the back just this bumped.
2707120	2713120	I texted them a photo of my second Emmy with an arrow pointing at it,
2713120	2715120	because there's two of them.
2717120	2719120	One must be for humility.
2720120	2724120	Most outstanding use of humility in a straight white male.
2725120	2729120	Does the new Emmy look newer than the old one?
2730120	2731120	No.
2731120	2733120	Well, I haven't looked that close to him.
2733120	2734120	I'm high on life.
2734120	2735120	Okay.
2735120	2739120	So I texted the photo, and then my mom texted.
2739120	2741120	We just found out yesterday, congratulations.
2741120	2742120	I'm very proud of you.
2742120	2746120	And then she said, do we ever congratulate you on your 70-episode thing?
2746120	2747120	So cool.
2747120	2751120	And then there was a pause, and then the last thing was from my mom saying,
2751120	2755120	you were right, leave the car where it is, which I assume is just, she just...
2758120	2761120	Did you text your other dad as well?
2761120	2762120	I did, actually.
2762120	2767120	Well, yeah, because he, my surrogate father, Heath Collins,
2767120	2770120	who is still dad, and my phone texted, congratulations.
2770120	2771120	And I was like, thank you, dad.
2771120	2773120	And we actually bonded for a while about it.
2773120	2775120	And yeah, it was nice.
2775120	2778120	Actually, I think we've decided to just role play that now.
2779120	2783120	And it's kind of like, yeah, if that works, then that should be how it works.
2783120	2785120	Man, you're glowing.
2785120	2786120	Thank you.
2786120	2787120	You're glowing.
2787120	2788120	Thank you.
2788120	2789120	You're very, very happy, aren't you?
2789120	2791120	All right, let me read you guys this, because I want to...
2791120	2793120	You're very happy with yourself.
2793120	2797120	So like I was saying earlier, so you go like, okay, well...
2797120	2803120	Why isn't the tongue considered more than it is?
2803120	2807120	I mean, it's not a limb, but it's a fingernail away from being a mouth finger.
2807120	2809120	You know, like it's...
2809120	2813120	Why don't we say it's like a tongue?
2813120	2815120	The tongue's way better than a fingernail.
2815120	2816120	Go ahead, you were just talking, Dan.
2818120	2820120	Mouth finger.
2822120	2823120	You can point with it.
2823120	2826120	What you need is somebody to ground you.
2828120	2829120	Yeah, I mean, it's...
2829120	2831120	I think we'd make a big deal of it.
2831120	2833120	She won't come to Harman Town.
2835120	2836120	All right, let us have it.
2836120	2839120	You know that we're tubes.
2841120	2843120	We're like big worms.
2843120	2844120	Yeah.
2844120	2845120	Not me.
2845120	2847120	And then when you eat something, you're just rubbing up against it
2847120	2851120	with the outside of your body that became the inner ring of this, like,
2851120	2854120	torus shape that's been extruded.
2854120	2855120	Not me, though.
2855120	2857120	That doesn't apply to me.
2859120	2860120	All right.
2860120	2863120	And that's why butt chugging will kill you, kids.
2863120	2864120	Don't do it.
2865120	2868120	You're putting vodka into a hole that is not designed.
2868120	2869120	Butt chugging?
2869120	2870120	Yes.
2870120	2871120	Oh, yeah.
2871120	2872120	Kids are dying out there.
2872120	2873120	Butt chugging.
2873120	2876120	They put funnels in their asses and pour whiskey down it.
2876120	2878120	And they're dying from butt chugging.
2878120	2879120	Yeah.
2879120	2882120	And the ladies with the tampons and the...
2882120	2884120	Ladies and the tampons.
2884120	2888120	Those are the people dumping vodka into your butt?
2888120	2890120	No, well, I don't know if they are.
2890120	2891120	I don't know who's helping with that.
2891120	2892120	We have the ladies and the tampons.
2892120	2894120	The vodka-soaked tampons is the other thing.
2894120	2896120	Vodka-soaked tampons.
2896120	2901120	It hits your system quicker because those membranes are more...
2901120	2903120	less selective, I guess.
2903120	2906120	What fucking Emmy parties were you going to?
2908120	2910120	I didn't go to any.
2911120	2912120	Neither did I.
2912120	2913120	Okay.
2914120	2915120	All right.
2915120	2917120	So I thought, okay, why don't you click on something?
2917120	2918120	And this is not...
2918120	2919120	This is not...
2920120	2922120	Is this an hour after we're talking?
2922120	2925120	No, this is right before I came to the show.
2925120	2928120	I went to my email and I was like, what's going on?
2928120	2929120	All right, I got to deal with that.
2929120	2930120	I got to deal with that.
2930120	2933120	And then I always get one email from the publicist that's like,
2933120	2935120	press round up.
2935120	2936120	And then I'm like, well, all right.
2936120	2938120	And then I'll just see a bunch of headlines.
2938120	2940120	And I was like, oh, the show won an Emmy.
2940120	2942120	So it's an extra big email.
2942120	2943120	It's all hyperlinked.
2943120	2946120	And I go like, well, top one is AV Club.
2946120	2948120	And it says, Pickle Rick won a fucking Emmy.
2948120	2951120	You know, it's like, which is more than just like reporting.
2951120	2952120	And I just felt...
2953120	2954120	I'm like, I'm just gonna...
2954120	2957120	I'm gonna look at it, see what the AV Club take is.
2957120	2961120	I had such a long relationship with them as a metric of television culture
2961120	2962120	and whatnot.
2962120	2964120	Like, let's just read the paragraph there.
2964120	2967120	And it was like, you know, faithful reporting of the fact and whatever.
2967120	2969120	And then I'm like, God damn it.
2969120	2971120	There's the comment section.
2971120	2972120	And you can just see the top of one.
2972120	2974120	And they have like this interface where you can...
2974120	2977120	You have to click to uncloak like all of it.
2977120	2979120	And I sure enough, I fucking did.
2979120	2981120	And I just saw this exchange.
2981120	2984120	And this is not about me.
2984120	2985120	How about you?
2985120	2986120	I thought this was...
2986120	2988120	Nothing to do with you.
2988120	2990120	This is everything about me.
2990120	2995120	But it's not me going, you should feel sorry for me
2995120	2997120	because that's not what I'm doing.
2997120	2999120	I just think...
2999120	3001120	This is more like me kind of...
3001120	3004120	In my mind, this is me dancing on the graves of my enemies.
3004120	3007120	Because my enemies are humanity at this point.
3007120	3008120	Okay.
3008120	3014120	So there's a comment that starts it as this guy says,
3014120	3017120	is that Harmon's first Emmy?
3017120	3018120	Hot take.
3018120	3020120	I like Dan Harmon.
3020120	3022120	Not just his shows.
3022120	3023120	I root for the guy.
3023120	3027120	Yeah, he slips up and acts like a drunken asshole sometimes.
3027120	3033120	He will admit to that and apologize for it and try to learn from it.
3033120	3035120	Harmon town is going strong.
3035120	3038120	300 episodes in, well deserved Emmy win.
3038120	3040120	That could be any of us.
3040120	3043120	It's a weird way to express it.
3043120	3045120	But we're not going to nitpick any of that.
3045120	3047120	Then the replies to that.
3047120	3049120	Because now we've started a conversation.
3049120	3050120	Let's have it.
3050120	3053120	I mean, hey, let's talk about this.
3053120	3055120	This is where the response goes.
3055120	3058120	If he keeps slipping up, then he isn't really...
3058120	3059120	You know what?
3059120	3061120	Why am I making this guy have a funny voice?
3061120	3062120	Please do.
3062120	3063120	Sorry.
3063120	3064120	Because he's an asshole.
3064120	3065120	I like the voice.
3065120	3066120	Because he's an asshole.
3066120	3067120	Let me make this guy James Brolin and let me just slightly...
3067120	3068120	All right.
3068120	3069120	Let's give him a funny voice.
3069120	3070120	Fuck this dude.
3070120	3071120	James Brolin's good though.
3071120	3075120	If he keeps slipping up, then he isn't really learning from it, is he?
3075120	3077120	Apologizing is easy.
3077120	3079120	Fixing your shit is the hard part.
3079120	3080120	Oh God.
3080120	3083120	Says Pimp Hand of Cisco.
3086120	3087120	Yeah.
3087120	3090120	And then a person responds to them.
3090120	3091120	Yes.
3091120	3093120	And says, yeah.
3093120	3097120	This person's responding and they agree.
3097120	3098120	This is...
3098120	3101120	Like someone saw that and was like, yeah, I better get in there.
3101120	3103120	Because same Z's.
3103120	3104120	Yeah.
3104120	3105120	Yeah.
3105120	3113120	Sometimes he strikes me as one of those, just do it and apologize if you get caught type
3113120	3114120	of guys.
3114120	3118120	And he's just getting better at apologizing.
3118120	3122120	Here's the society's worst nightmare.
3122120	3127120	What if this famous person is in an endless cycle of headlines we're reading?
3127120	3132120	What if he just keeps doing things we don't like and then saying he's sorry we didn't
3132120	3133120	like them?
3133120	3134120	Oh my God.
3134120	3140120	Someone get a message to this guy before he wastes his life.
3140120	3145120	Well, obviously it's a joke more for me than you, I guess.
3145120	3147120	I just thought...
3147120	3150120	I guess I'm the only person that understands what that's like.
3150120	3152120	I think there's a lot there.
3152120	3153120	Yeah.
3153120	3154120	It's a lot to unpack.
3154120	3155120	Right.
3155120	3156120	Sort of.
3156120	3157120	Sort of.
3157120	3160120	I'm just like, okay.
3160120	3162120	You know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3162120	3164120	He strikes me as...
3164120	3167120	Stop right there.
3167120	3170120	Who types that?
3170120	3172120	He strikes me as...
3172120	3174120	I'm a human being.
3174120	3175120	I strike you as nothing.
3175120	3177120	You don't know me.
3177120	3180120	He strikes me as...
3180120	3183120	He strikes me as a famous person is what he strikes you as.
3183120	3185120	That's how he's designed to strike you.
3185120	3187120	That's how he will strike you.
3187120	3192120	Because he's not your uncle and he's not your babysitter and he's not your mailman.
3192120	3194120	So he strikes you as a famous person.
3194120	3195120	No, no, no, no.
3195120	3197120	He strikes me as...
3197120	3199120	He strikes me as the kind of guy...
3199120	3202120	There's a lot of different kinds of guys.
3202120	3203120	Let me get this straight.
3203120	3204120	I'm going to go, hold on.
3204120	3205120	Mr. Whiskers.
3205120	3206120	Meow.
3206120	3207120	Let me get you.
3207120	3208120	Let me get you.
3208120	3209120	You love it.
3209120	3210120	I'm sorry.
3210120	3211120	You know.
3211120	3213120	This is the city of Waukegan calling.
3213120	3215120	It's an outstanding parking ticket.
3215120	3216120	What is it?
3216120	3217120	Beep, beep.
3217120	3220120	Hey, your mother still needs that kidney.
3220120	3222120	Beep, beep.
3222120	3223120	Anyways.
3223120	3224120	God damn it.
3224120	3225120	It's fucking distractions.
3225120	3230120	Dan Harmon strikes me as the kind of guy...
3231120	3235120	I think he's just going to keep on doing things wrong.
3235120	3239120	And then he just is going to keep on apologizing for them.
3239120	3241120	And I, for one, I want no part of it.
3241120	3243120	I don't want any more part of it.
3243120	3245120	I am closing my laptop.
3245120	3252120	But I'm going to use ghost fingers to check in and see if he breaks that cycle.
3252120	3258120	Because only then will he get the ghost reward that I give to people who've become perfect.
3258120	3263120	And by perfect, I mean doing nothing and therefore not apologizing for it.
3263120	3265120	I hate America.
3269120	3272120	Also, it's not easy to apologize.
3272120	3274120	That sentence sucks.
3274120	3277120	It's not easy to admit that you make mistakes.
3277120	3279120	It's easy to say my bad, my bad.
3279120	3280120	I'm sorry.
3280120	3281120	I'm sorry.
3281120	3282120	Whatever.
3282120	3284120	Sit your ass down, bro.
3285120	3286120	Exactly.
3287120	3288120	I'm sorry.
3288120	3289120	See?
3296120	3297120	And then you stopped reading.
3297120	3298120	I take it.
3298120	3299120	Yes, I did.
3299120	3300120	Good.
3300120	3301120	At least I got that.
3301120	3302120	At least I did.
3302120	3304120	And maybe that's the only kind of improvement you could hope for.
3304120	3306120	45 years old, three years from retirement.
3306120	3310120	Okay, I got to the point where I only have to read three comments down before I'm like,
3310120	3311120	what are you doing?
3311120	3314120	I'm going to take a screenshot and share it with your friends.
3314120	3317120	And also that I'm like, yeah.
3317120	3320120	Did she say three years into retirement?
3320120	3322120	Three years until retirement.
3322120	3323120	Oh, until retirement.
3323120	3324120	Okay.
3324120	3325120	Yeah.
3325120	3326120	Watch me.
3326120	3328120	What are you going to do?
3328120	3335120	I'm going to play Minecraft and I'm going to just sit around the house and just poke
3335120	3336120	around.
3336120	3342120	You know, I'm going to, I'm just going to sit around and play Minecraft.
3342120	3346120	You're going to beat his ass.
3346120	3348120	That's the first day of retirement.
3348120	3349120	Okay.
3349120	3350120	All right.
3350120	3352120	This is a story that will make you feel better.
3352120	3353120	Okay.
3353120	3356120	So this happened to me on Labor Day.
3356120	3357120	Labor Day.
3357120	3359120	So it's Labor Day evening.
3359120	3361120	Labor Day is now Labor Night.
3361120	3364120	And I'm going, I'm walking the dog.
3364120	3365120	I'm walking the dog.
3365120	3366120	I'm walking the dog.
3366120	3367120	I'm walking the dog.
3367120	3370120	The dog starts to, Lonnie's taking a shit.
3370120	3377960	All of a sudden, car drives, stops in the middle of the road.
3377960	3378960	Woman gets out.
3378960	3385360	She's, you know, she's like, I don't know, maybe, you know, like 50, 55 or whatever.
3385360	3389840	She goes, oh, oh, oh my goodness, do you speak Armenian?
3389840	3390840	Speak Armenian.
3390840	3394200	I'm like, no, I do not.
3394200	3395800	Speak Armenian.
3395800	3399640	And she goes, and she looks like, oh my gosh, is something wrong?
3399640	3401960	And she's like, you know, my baby fell out or whatever.
3401960	3403440	You know, she comes over to me.
3403440	3404440	She runs to me.
3404440	3411000	She's holding like what looks like a gummy bear wrapper and she's pointing to it.
3411000	3414840	And she's like, why does it she like going, please listen to me.
3414840	3415840	Please listen to me.
3415840	3416840	Just look, look.
3416840	3419800	Listen, you're walking your dog and the driver stopped.
3419800	3420800	Yeah.
3420800	3423600	She runs and she leaves her car door open.
3423600	3426080	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
3426080	3427960	Okay, Michael Winslow.
3427960	3432320	Door's open, car in the middle of the road.
3432320	3434080	Runs up to me while my dog's shitting.
3434080	3436960	And I'm like trying to, you know, split focus.
3436960	3438240	So I gotta watch.
3438240	3439240	Why you for?
3439240	3440240	Nevermind.
3440240	3444720	Because I gotta pick it up and I don't want to step on it.
3444720	3450400	Okay, so she comes up and she's like, oh my god, sir, sir, please, please listen to me.
3451000	3452000	Look, look.
3452000	3458000	It's a gummy bear wrapper pointing to, honey, honey, Costco, it'll grow back.
3458000	3459000	It'll grow back.
3459000	3460000	It'll grow back.
3460000	3461000	And I'm like.
3461000	3462000	What?
3462000	3463000	What?
3463000	3467600	She goes, please, please.
3467600	3472880	She's trying to give me this wrapper at Costco, it's honey, it'll grow.
3472880	3473880	It'll grow back.
3473880	3474880	Please, please.
3474880	3478040	And I'm like, I don't need that, madam.
3478040	3479040	Thank you.
3479040	3485200	And she's like, please, please.
3485200	3494040	And I start getting pissed because the pleading, the, sir, you're bleeding right now.
3494040	3497880	You are so bald, you don't understand.
3497880	3499440	You gotta fix this shit.
3499440	3502840	I will never fuck you with my uncle's dick.
3502840	3509000	I can't believe it that you're walking outside with this gash across your face.
3509960	3514320	And I, and I'm getting pissed and I go, I don't need that.
3514320	3517960	I'm happy with what I look like.
3517960	3520960	You can take that back to your car.
3520960	3521960	Please, please.
3521960	3523560	And I'm like, I'm not taking it.
3523560	3525440	I'm not taking it.
3525440	3527240	I'm not taking it.
3527240	3534360	And she's like, and she's like, goes back to her car and, and, and, and, uh, she's like
3534360	3538680	still yelling out, Costco, it's in Costco, driving away.
3539680	3543960	Wait, no, so when she was saying honey, she was addressing you as honey.
3543960	3544960	I don't know.
3544960	3548160	She wasn't telling you to go to Costco and get honey and rub it on your head because
3548160	3554560	I was trying to give you an advertisement for either her or her sister's like, uh, thing
3554560	3555560	at Costco.
3555560	3558640	I didn't have my glasses on and I would not touch that wrapper, but it looked like something
3558640	3563080	she picked off their car floor and looked like a gummy bear wrapper.
3563080	3567960	And she kept pointing at it, saying honey, later on I thought maybe she's calling me
3567960	3572520	honey, like sweetie, seriously, we need to talk about your problem at Costco.
3572520	3577640	I know people that work at Costco who don't work for Costco, they work within Costco and
3577640	3584640	they, and they have the whole sub, sub, uh, industry of people with, uh, little kiosks
3584640	3585640	inside Costco.
3585640	3586640	Right.
3586640	3591680	So they're like, like soak your fingernails in this and like, that lady's, uh, that lady's
3591680	3595520	head was like, like, like, like, I think she's like, look, it was like Thanksgiving.
3595520	3596520	I get to tell Rita.
3596520	3598280	I'm from busting my ass for you.
3598280	3603440	Like I, like, like, you know, she's like, I'm fucking like my family's going to succeed
3603440	3605160	because I'm going to like, I'm going to push.
3605160	3610720	I was so stunned because the car stopped and she flew out.
3610720	3614400	I'm like, okay, what adventure am I about to go on to?
3614400	3617600	Like, is this like my baby was hit by a truck.
3617600	3619720	Could you please take me to the thing?
3619720	3620720	You know, I don't know.
3620720	3621720	I don't know.
3621720	3626480	And then it slowly turns into this, you got a serious problem up there, buddy.
3626480	3629600	The crazy thing is how long has she lived in LA?
3629600	3632360	Has she ever seen a bald LAPD officer?
3632360	3635800	And if so, why is she alive?
3635800	3641120	If she jumps out of cars and charges people with an unknown object in her hand saying,
3641120	3646120	like, like, like, like, I mean, she like statistically should be done.
3646120	3652320	Now this is, this is, this is not necessarily like a, it's more of a tag than anything,
3652760	3658760	and then I go home and I ordered, I had ordered pizza and I get back in and I'm like, I don't
3658760	3662360	need a gummy bear on my, what are you talking about?
3662360	3666600	I'm all pissed off and I'm, you know, like, this isn't fair.
3666600	3668440	People shouldn't talk to other people like that.
3668440	3670920	It's like, and then ding dong, the pizza's here.
3670920	3671920	I go downstairs.
3671920	3678640	Now, I don't know if this is related at all or whether it was a weird night, whatever.
3678640	3683720	But the pizza place that I order from, it's always the same guy that delivers the pizza
3683720	3689960	and he's an Armenian guy and he's like, oh, pizza boy, pizza boy, pizza boy, good, oh,
3689960	3690960	good, hot, delicious.
3690960	3694000	And he's bald, you know, he's like me, you know, shaved hair.
3694000	3706160	You know, this time I go down and he's wearing a wig and sunglasses and I, I, you know, walked
3706160	3712560	down there and I looked at it and I smiled thinking like, oh, Labor Day is going to be
3712560	3715440	dressing up like Bruce Lee.
3715440	3717040	It's Burt Reynolds.
3717040	3719240	It's a Burt Reynolds party.
3719240	3725040	And I'm smiling and I'm getting closer and closer.
3725040	3727080	That's not a Halloween wig.
3727080	3730640	That's a real toupee wig.
3730640	3738960	And I just like, I had to hold the face because if I dropped it, he would have, you could
3738960	3739960	tell it's not real.
3739960	3744320	And that in combination with the encounter with that woman, like made you feel like,
3744320	3747240	all Armenians hate bald people.
3747240	3748240	Yeah.
3748240	3749240	Yeah.
3749240	3752920	He was like, my wife, see you walking, try give you stuff that work for me, look head
3752920	3753920	of hair.
3753920	3759640	Well, I told you about, I had an Armenian doctor that, you know, when I had my ass problem.
3759640	3765520	Man, don't get us in trouble with the Kardashians in this motherfucker.
3765520	3770320	And then he, he one point said, Oh, you need, you need hair plugs.
3770320	3772200	And I was like, I don't think so.
3772200	3774200	I don't, I don't need him.
3774200	3778600	And he goes, here, let me give you some advice.
3778600	3782480	Eat what you want to feel good for you.
3782480	3786000	Look how everybody else wants you to look.
3786920	3791400	And I went, that is the worst advice I've ever heard.
3791400	3795760	I'm never, I think Woodsy Owl said that to me as our captain planet.
3795760	3796760	I think.
3796760	3797760	Put that on a t-shirt.
3797760	3800880	I was like, get the fuck out of here.
3800880	3802560	Get the fuck out of your own office.
3802560	3803560	Billy Crystal character.
3803560	3804560	Yeah.
3804560	3813360	I was like, what the hell are your lungs so healthy, but so fat, so fat.
3813360	3818120	And just like having stuff to talk about, I think, and it's like, Oh yeah, you're bald.
3818120	3819120	Let's talk about that.
3819120	3820120	Yeah.
3820120	3821120	Here's the thing.
3821120	3822120	When you're bald, you forget.
3822120	3823120	Yeah.
3823120	3824120	You forget.
3824120	3825120	You forget until somebody goes.
3825120	3826120	Right.
3826120	3827120	Oh yeah.
3827120	3831720	Well, what you're forgetting is the thing that you should forget, which it's like, it's,
3831720	3839840	it's, it's like, not to baldsplain to you, but it's like, it's like, I, it's like you,
3839840	3845760	what you're being reminded of is that you're being, uh, that it's their, their, their perception.
3845760	3846760	It's only their opinion.
3846760	3847760	Right.
3847760	3849160	It's, it's, it's, it's nothing to do.
3849160	3854800	I mean, I know this is all a big dadoi, like, like, like, but it's, you know, in this last
3854800	3859800	couple of years has been, I mean, for you, I've known you since college and you were,
3859800	3863560	you started losing your hair in college and as long as I've known you, I've always, I've
3863560	3869000	always been like, Oh, I have this friend who like, like has this different take on like,
3869000	3874480	you know, it's like, it's like, we have these opinions about hair loss and all this stuff
3874480	3880520	and we know they're all unconscious and all this stuff, but it, it, it, it, now I'm thinning
3880520	3886600	in back and I'm like, I've got, I've got my hymns, my for hymns, for hymns.com, for hymns.com,
3886600	3887600	like kit.
3887600	3888600	Cause they're a sponsor sometimes.
3888600	3890600	I don't support those guys.
3890600	3892360	Hey, come on, man.
3892360	3893440	That's not snake oil.
3893440	3896080	They're real prescriptions that a real doctor prescribes.
3896080	3902160	Hymns, hymns, if you're listening to me, you know, all right, give it to make, grow my
3902160	3903160	hair back.
3903160	3905960	Well, grow my hair back, grow my hair back.
3905960	3919360	If you grow my hair back, I'll give you $5 million for hair, cryro sessions in minutes.
3919360	3920360	It's crazy.
3920360	3925640	The things that we say to each other and say to ourselves, I know it's like, I'm not, I
3925840	3931120	just like, I'm, I kind of, just because of the age we're living in now where everybody's
3931120	3935120	getting in trouble for everything, which you could just cynically go like, I've had it and
3935120	3941320	I have had it, but also it also just makes me think about everything that's said and
3941320	3944200	everything we're saying to each other and all that stuff, but it was like giving it to
3944200	3950320	like even my own body, the things that I tell myself when I look in the mirror, let alone
3950320	3953440	like just like, yeah, it's, it's weird.
3953440	3958160	Like it, it, it, it, like, I don't know, like, like, why am I trying to act like that's
3958160	3959160	a big point that I'm making?
3959160	3960160	Is this weird?
3960160	3961160	Is this a new shirt?
3961160	3962720	Is this shirt new?
3962720	3963920	It's probably, it's probably old.
3963920	3969080	I'm probably, I'm going through the closet and I'm like, I have, I have had, you know,
3969080	3975720	like guys maybe back me up, guys with fluctuating weight, you get a shirt where the buttons
3975720	3980760	are popping and you, you don't, you don't put it in the Goodwill bag right away.
3980760	3984680	Like you, not if you're fluctuating weight, like you take it and you look at it and you
3984680	3990480	go, I'll be back motherfucker and you, and, and, and then slowly over the years because
3990480	3995400	you keep getting fatter, your weight fluctuates, but you keep getting fatter.
3995400	4000760	So if you're lucky enough to have a big enough closet, like you start to, the overall effect
4000760	4005320	is a large library of shirts that never fit you for various reasons.
4005320	4011080	And it, it, it, it, it, every morning I like, I have like a 10 minute like pad that I have
4011080	4014480	to give myself because I'm like going through and going, oh yeah, what's your name?
4014480	4015480	When did we meet last?
4015480	4016480	All right.
4016480	4020360	All right, Paul, time to take another ride around the fucking block.
4020360	4021920	And then I'm like, okay, still won't work.
4021920	4022920	That's fine.
4022920	4023920	Put it back.
4023920	4029720	I'll also just like, I'll throw them like angrily, like, so then the, like, they can
4029720	4035280	go through the wash and probably get smaller, but I think, I assume this is one of the things
4035280	4041860	one of those, or maybe it's a, a well, a well bought, um, uh, bomb fell shirt from bomb
4041860	4042860	fell.com.
4042860	4048760	Hey kids, do you want a box of shit to, you know what I heard in a podcast?
4048760	4053120	I like, well, yeah, here's a, here's a, here's a generic ad literally.
4053120	4058240	If you want to personalize that for your, your company, Hey, uh, uh, if you like this
4058240	4062800	show, then you know, like me, what it's like to not have a box of shit delivered to your
4062800	4063800	house.
4063800	4071000	Um, the people at a box of shit.com, um, believe that shit should come in boxes to
4071000	4076520	your house, whereas they used to not be able to because the fucking infrastructure's changed.
4076520	4079120	So like, look, we're here today.
4079120	4080240	We might be gone tomorrow.
4080240	4081240	We don't know.
4081240	4082240	It's all up to you.
4082240	4083240	Go to fucking Harmon town.
4083240	4085000	There's limited offer for our listeners.
4085000	4089720	Go to box of fucking shit's going to come to your house and some of the shit's just
4089720	4091880	like, we're like, Oh my God, of course.
4091880	4092880	Thank God.
4093320	4094320	And we don't know.
4094320	4098080	You got a sprinkle box of shit to companies over the top of everything and see what takes
4098080	4101840	a box of cat toys.
4101840	4102840	Didn't work.
4102840	4105960	We're like, look, Mike, maybe my cat hasn't been special this month.
4105960	4106960	I don't want to give it up.
4106960	4108280	Another fucking box of toys.
4108280	4109280	Fuck you.
4109280	4113440	But, uh, beer of the month box, you know, worthy Parker and people are like, you know
4113440	4114440	what fucking sucks.
4114440	4116160	It's like, like shopping for glasses or whatever.
4116160	4117160	Yeah.
4117160	4118820	Like you gotta, you gotta, you gotta test it all.
4118820	4119820	Maybe your toothbrush.
4119820	4120820	I don't know.
4120820	4121820	Maybe your foot.
4122260	4123260	Hey, want a new foot?
4123260	4124260	Hey, it's me.
4124260	4125260	Your foot.
4125260	4128580	When you get to the store for your foot, there's a box of foot.com comes to your house.
4128580	4131020	You get a foot where there's a left foot or a right foot.
4131020	4132020	You go to your door.
4132020	4133020	There's always a foot.
4133020	4134020	You have a subscription to a foot.
4134020	4135140	You can rate it and subscribe to it.
4135140	4136140	You can like it.
4136140	4137140	Put your foot on YouTube.
4137140	4138140	Share with your friends.
4138140	4139140	Again, with a slender man.
4139140	4140140	You can eat your foot.
4140140	4145420	You can tell it to a horror horror movie a week or a Hannibal Lecter esque character.
4145420	4148140	I'll walk you through which foot you should have.
4148140	4149860	The what was I going to say?
4149860	4150860	I forgot.
4151860	4153580	I was listening to a podcast.
4153580	4154580	It was my first brought.
4154580	4156380	I was like, that's irresponsible.
4156380	4161020	Um, like, like, because we're in this Wild West with podcast advertising and there's
4161020	4163620	this true crime thing I was listening to.
4163620	4169860	Uh, I think it was, uh, it's, it's just, I think it was a popular one.
4169860	4170860	Dr. Death.
4170860	4171860	Are you guys listening to Dr. Death?
4171860	4172860	No?
4172860	4173860	Okay.
4173860	4174860	Well, I thought I, then good.
4174860	4176380	Then I'm a Prometheus.
4176380	4177380	Listen to it.
4177380	4178820	Uh, I think it's only three episodes in it.
4178820	4179820	It's like a Syria.
4179820	4180820	One of those things.
4180820	4181820	It's like very like Dirty John.
4181820	4182820	He was a dirty guy.
4182820	4186140	So it's like, oh man, they break up like a very serious John.
4186140	4187140	Yeah.
4187140	4188140	Listen to Dirty John.
4188140	4189140	Holy shit.
4189140	4194500	This guy was like doctor who's not, he's not necessarily just a sociopath who pretended
4194500	4198980	to be a doctor, but then again, he was never a good doctor, but he just kind of bluffed
4198980	4200220	his way through the medical system.
4200220	4204820	It was like gouging out people's spines and like, uh, very interesting.
4204820	4209500	And uh, and then like early on in the podcast, the guy goes like, and then his name gouged
4209500	4212980	out this spine and then the person's leg turned blue and then they had a stroke and
4212980	4213980	now they're dead.
4213980	4218260	And it's like, um, if you, if you, and then he's pawned, there's this pause and then the
4218260	4227340	same voice says, uh, uh, this podcast may be making you feel very uncomfortable, um,
4227340	4231020	but nothing is more comfortable than a good pair of socks.
4231020	4236820	Like it was basically that, and I was like, I was aroused from my bed.
4236820	4242100	I was like, Cody, that's wrong.
4242100	4243100	That's not right.
4243100	4248140	Like you, you're like, like, they actually found it in a world where no one cares.
4248140	4250940	Like there's something fundamentally wrong about that.
4250940	4254820	I can't, I like, like, where you're like, it's back to the thirties or something or
4254820	4261260	you're just like, you can just now like, Hey, it's like this podcast is going to offend
4261260	4266860	you or, or it's going to raise your awareness of, of the civil rights era.
4266860	4272820	Uh, as we, as we go back in time to the 1960s, but you know what it'll take you back in time
4272820	4277980	more is like the, uh, a Reese's kiss I, I, I, I, I, that's fine, right?
4277980	4278980	Cause it's like, who cares?
4278980	4280580	It's just like a segue.
4280580	4284140	But why did, why was I offended by the socks making you comfortable?
4284140	4289540	Oh, it was because like, what if he said, cause there's that podcast, uh, uh, advertiser
4289540	4293620	that's like the, uh, real time shrinky dink, like they, like, you can like call a number
4293620	4299020	and have a shrink, you know, it's like, uh, feel, feel, feel fine.org or whatever.
4299020	4302900	Uh, like, like you can, it's like, uh, like, you know, clear, clear, clear, clear, clear
4302900	4305660	fun talk, like talk to somebody and say, don't, don't kill yourself.
4305660	4310140	Like talk to this thing and, and, uh, true crime podcasts will advertise it.
4310140	4314460	But like, what if, what if he used that say, it was like, this is going to make you uncomfortable
4314460	4318220	talking about this guy gouging out spines cause he's not a good doctor and like, like,
4318220	4319620	hey, maybe you'll be next.
4319620	4326300	Um, if that upsets you, you should call this company that profits every time you're freaked
4326300	4328020	out and you call the number.
4328020	4331140	I guess that's what I was thinking is like, like, that's what triggered me in me.
4331140	4337500	It was like, you can't make people uncomfortable and then tell them that socks will help.
4337500	4340660	It hasn't worked that way in years.
4340660	4341660	That's dangerous.
4341660	4344540	That's like a, it's like a hamster wheel of necessity.
4344540	4345540	You can't.
4345540	4346540	Yeah.
4346540	4349620	You can't be like, if you're listening to this podcast, you might, you currently might
4349620	4352500	be afraid of leaving your home.
4352500	4354020	You should buy it a new television.
4354020	4355020	Okay.
4355020	4356020	I guess that's what we do.
4356020	4357020	It's fucked up.
4357020	4358020	That's exactly what they do though.
4358020	4361300	That's why you see Taco Bell commercials at like one o'clock in the morning telling you
4361300	4364380	you should combo meal their shit because they know your stuff.
4364380	4365380	Yeah.
4365380	4366380	I know that.
4366380	4367380	So why did I, so what was it about the sock thing?
4367380	4372060	I guess it was because it was because podcasting for me is like a little bit, it's, it's both
4372060	4373060	sacred and unsacred.
4373060	4376500	It's sort of like, I feel like Al Swearingen looking at his window in Deadwood going like,
4376500	4381500	God damn telephone wires suck my dick, you know, like, I'm going to stab an Indian in
4381500	4382500	the stomach.
4382500	4383500	Cause I don't know.
4383500	4386140	And I'm just like, Oh, all the fucking senators here.
4386140	4387140	Fuck it.
4387140	4388140	I'm going to fuck everybody.
4388140	4392100	Also, there's, there's gotta be a little bit of love for something that's kind of hard
4392100	4393100	to do.
4393100	4396860	So maybe there's a little bit of admiration in there cause it, it's a, it's a corny segue
4396860	4398460	with that motherfucker went for it.
4399180	4403980	I just thought the podcast business was going to go like, okay, everybody, everybody spread
4403980	4408860	out and stay whatever the fuck you can think to say to make people listen to you.
4408860	4412920	And then after we do that for a while, let's slowly coalesce into networks and then let's
4412920	4420180	have those networks, uh, uh, engage in collective bargaining with, uh, a newly subjugated corporate
4420180	4421180	clientele.
4421180	4423180	Boy, was I wrong.
4423180	4424180	Yeah.
4424180	4425180	What is it instead?
4425180	4426180	I don't know.
4426180	4427180	It's just advertisers.
4427340	4428340	Yeah.
4428340	4431980	It's just like, it was just, it was just more like somebody else thought that that was like
4431980	4436060	me, but instead of a guy that likes to talk into a microphone, that person loves advertising
4436060	4440220	and it was like, Hey, I'll tell you what, why don't we, I, I belong to this agency that
4440220	4446020	there's like agencies rounding up the corporate clientele that are willing to advertise on
4446020	4451180	podcasts, which are more high risk for them PR wise, maybe, you know, it's a Wild West
4451180	4452180	kind of thing.
4452180	4454140	So you, you notice the kind of clientele you're getting.
4454140	4460340	It's like, it's the kind that your brain goes, Oh yeah, they don't risk anything.
4460340	4464060	Like Snickers isn't advertising during podcasts yet.
4464060	4470300	And uh, yeah, so it's like somebody went around and gathered all those people up into families
4470300	4474780	and then they collectively bargained like, Hey, what, what the fuck's your podcast about?
4474780	4476660	What you fucking getting high and watching movies?
4476660	4477660	Yes.
4477660	4478660	So's everybody's come on.
4478660	4479660	What do you got for us?
4480660	4484660	Well, I promise they'll tell everybody to wear your socks for a dollar.
4486660	4488660	I want it to go that way.
4488660	4493500	There's something worse than just podcast advertising about like true crime podcast
4493500	4494500	advertising though.
4494500	4495500	Isn't there?
4495500	4502860	It's like, and then like her blood was spread like everywhere and no one could find most
4502860	4503860	of it.
4503860	4505780	Also, tied gum.
4505780	4506780	It's gum now.
4506780	4507780	It's gum on your friends and clean their shirt.
4507780	4508780	Yeah.
4508780	4509780	Should've told you that last week.
4509780	4510780	You're clean.
4510780	4511780	Your clothes get cleaner as you wear them.
4511780	4512780	It's gum now.
4512780	4527060	It just seems gruesome to be all like, yeah, man, fucking buy this because all these people
4527060	4528060	died.
4528060	4531660	Because the body was wrapped in a soft blanket from Downey.
4531660	4536020	So we're worried about if he was using the gravity blanket.
4536020	4541220	There was a pretty fun sophisticated like, oh, first people to do it in a comprehensive
4541220	4542220	way.
4542220	4547340	Like a podcast spoof that was like a, it was a spoof of the podcast that I poked a little
4547340	4552980	fun of on, on here a while back about the, I don't know, it was like done disappeared
4552980	4554340	or gone up and vanished.
4554340	4555340	What podcast?
4555340	4558940	Up and vanished I think is the real one, right?
4558940	4564500	And then someone did a spoof of up and vanished that I think was called done disappeared.
4565260	4572260	If you haven't heard it, it's really funny and it's also like sociologically edifying
4572260	4577300	because you're like, you're living in the beginning of a new medium and this is like
4577300	4583820	one of the first like actual like kind of Yankovic Kings, like, oh, it's like, oh, this
4583820	4584820	popular podcast.
4584820	4589380	And then someone not only just sat there like me and went like, you heard this one guy needs
4589380	4591660	to get a fucking haircut.
4591660	4596500	You know, somebody, somebody like dug in and like did a spoof and I'm fascinated by
4596500	4597500	that stuff too.
4597500	4598500	As we're watching it evolve.
4598500	4600980	Why do I have to try to take the fun out of everything?
4600980	4605380	But I remember when I was like in my twenties, like, like, like I got, I got high with you
4605380	4609260	and Sean McKenna and we were talking about something and then like, I was, you guys are
4609260	4611260	talking about like songs or something.
4611260	4615420	And then I was like, yeah, it's funny because you listen to a first time and then you listen
4615420	4618500	and they talked for a while and there was a big pause and then you and Sean both went
4618500	4621540	like, oh, is that how we enjoy things?
4622540	4624260	Thanks.
4624260	4625460	We said that in unison.
4625460	4631860	You basically like you both, you both, you, I mean, worse than that.
4631860	4637340	I was like, I was, is it possible that Sean just said that and I was just sitting next
4637340	4638340	to him.
4638340	4641780	I know I was being, no, that's exactly why I don't remember this story because it was
4641780	4643260	so in caring.
4643260	4648860	It was so you guys both looked at each other and both had the same thought and didn't even
4648860	4652660	need to conspire about it.
4652660	4656860	And I was like, you know, the old saying, if somebody calls you a horse's ass, maybe
4656860	4657860	they're a horse's ass.
4657860	4662820	If two people call you a horse's ass, maybe get a saddle or whatever it goes like, like,
4662820	4666780	it was like, you guys were both like, I just finished explaining.
4666780	4668780	I just, I'm always explaining everything.
4668780	4673620	I'm a fucking explainaholic or, uh, yeah, that's it.
4673620	4674620	That was the word.
4674620	4675620	Yeah.
4675620	4676620	But with booze.
4677620	4678620	Can I ask?
4679620	4680620	It's a Simpsons joke.
4680620	4681620	That's what I was going to ask you.
4681620	4682620	That's so hilarious.
4682620	4684620	Is you beat, beat in quotes.
4684620	4685620	Oh my God.
4685620	4686620	We beat the Simpsons.
4686620	4687620	You beat the Simpsons.
4687620	4688620	Those guys are so amazing.
4688620	4689620	And you beat South Park.
4689620	4690620	Yeah.
4690620	4692620	And that's pretty fucking amazing.
4692620	4694620	How does that feel?
4694620	4695620	How does that feel?
4695620	4697620	Like, like, there's no right.
4697620	4698620	Does that feel, huh?
4698620	4701620	I'm happy for once.
4701620	4702620	Humbling.
4702620	4703620	Humbling.
4703620	4704620	There we go.
4704620	4705620	Really?
4705620	4706620	No, no, no.
4706620	4707620	Really?
4707620	4708620	Does it feel bad?
4708620	4709620	Because it feels bad ass.
4709620	4710620	It does feel a little bad.
4710620	4711620	Feels bad ass.
4711620	4712620	I get it.
4712620	4713620	What I'm impressed.
4713620	4717620	Those guys, those colleagues, like they come up to you, you're all at the same party, you
4717620	4722620	know, and it's like, it is, it really is like, I, you know, you get jaded and you go, uh,
4722620	4726620	you know, you're never going to win this fucking thing because it's like, and you, you, because
4726620	4727620	it's huge competition.
4727620	4728620	And then there's always like people.
4728620	4730620	That's all we, it's all we talk about.
4730620	4732620	Did you give a speech?
4732620	4733620	No.
4733620	4735620	You get 30 seconds, Justin.
4735620	4737620	Justin goes, I want to thank everyone.
4737620	4739620	Thank you very much.
4739620	4742620	Thank you for this award for Rick and Morty.

4756620	4757620	Thank you.
4757620	4760620	We're playing the music.
4760620	4762620	I don't know.
4762620	4766620	Justin, Justin went from saying whatever he said to, as we're all walking off, I was
4766620	4767620	like, I did it wrong.
4767620	4768620	I did it wrong.
4768620	4769620	I did this.
4769620	4772620	I was like, Justin, no one up here heard you.
4772620	4774620	We're all freaking the fuck out.
4774620	4775620	Yeah.
4775620	4776620	Like, like, like no one hurt.
4776620	4777620	We don't, we will, and we'll never know.
4777620	4781620	Cause like, like, who's, who, who in that 11 people that were up there is ever going
4781620	4783620	to like, I think I'll find out what he said.
4783620	4786620	We're, we're the only ones that will never know and don't care.
4786620	4788620	It's not aired.
4788620	4789620	Uh, yeah.
4789620	4794140	They're going to edit them together and they'll do like a little shmimmy, shmimmy round up
4794140	4795140	on a FX X.
4795140	4800140	Was there, was there anybody cool there that you got to meet that you were sort of.
4800140	4804740	Molly Shannon was a presenter and she was right in the front row and she was like, I,
4804740	4809060	as I was like coming back from, you do this whole conveyor belt when you, if you win one
4809060	4812700	and then you, and then you like at strategic points, they open the doors and let you back
4812700	4813700	into your seats.
4813700	4818980	And I was crossing and Molly Shannon was like, I made eye contact with her and she was really
4818980	4826660	sweet and nice and, um, uh, uh, if you're, I think you're asking what I'm answering,
4826660	4830180	which is like, did you have any encounters with famous people that you, just the ones
4830180	4834740	you like, if there were any moments where you're like, holy shit, I was talking to our
4834740	4835740	Georgia.
4835740	4838020	I mean, I saw, you know, like they did this big Star Trek thing.
4838020	4842740	So LaVar Burton's up there and I'm like, I'm going to fucking mad dog them and tell you,
4842740	4845300	you know, like, I'm going to make eye contact with this guy.
4845300	4848820	Cause I was like right in the wings, I was coming back to the thing and like, I was like,
4848820	4853220	and I just looked at LaVar Burton and waited for him to look at me as I walked past.
4853220	4857340	I was like, he's not like, he didn't look and he's blind as me.
4857340	4863260	Did he have his, he didn't have his thing on, but I thought it'd be so funny.
4863260	4864860	Like how amazing it was.
4864860	4866420	It was a low risk high yield thing.
4866420	4871260	Cause I was like, I'm going to totally mad dog LaVar Burton and on the off chance that
4871260	4876180	he like looks and see, cause he peripherally like experiences like this, like who's staring
4876180	4877180	at me?
4877180	4882300	And then like, like, what if he had like Wally's on stage going, going like, Hey.
4882300	4886300	And then like, I did, I had this fantasy in my head of like, and then if people would
4886300	4887940	be like, what the fuck's going on over there?
4887940	4891460	Like who gets, why is LaVar Burton like crouching down and hugging somebody?
4891460	4892460	Who's that?
4892460	4893780	Oh, that guy's got an Emmy.
4893780	4894780	That's Dan Harmon.
4894780	4899140	Well, what, what mountains can't he climb?
4899140	4900140	Is there any got an Emmy?
4900140	4901780	Why is he like, who is LaVar Burton?
4902220	4903700	Jesus, I gotta look this guy up.
4903700	4905220	Oh, he's a pedophile.
4908420	4909420	God damn it.
4909420	4910420	Well, I didn't know that.
4910420	4911420	Damn it.
4911420	4914100	We were on such a great run.
4914100	4916020	You just fucked it up.
4916020	4918540	Can you explain what is the LaVar Burton thing?
4918540	4923340	Oh, well he, he, he was, he was at your podium for a while ago.
4923340	4929620	Jeff was, Jeff was on an extended like tour and we were on the road and we did like a
4929620	4934340	fun like string of, of guest comptroller's Gilbert Gottfried.
4934340	4939700	And there was some, there was some really fun, like, and LaVar Burton was one of them.
4939700	4940700	Holy shit.
4940700	4941700	It was great.
4941700	4946420	I mean, so even with you, I hadn't, I wasn't married to Aaron McGathey yet and he was like,
4946420	4949220	in that podcast, he's like, I will, I'm coming to your wedding.
4949220	4954980	I think we're just shit faced and like, you still, you still feel a little shy to go over
4954980	4955980	to LaVar Burton?
4955980	4959580	Well, I'm, you know, he never came to my wedding.
4959580	4964940	So I, so I, so then I'm like, all right, is he, are we beefing?
4964940	4967180	If we aren't like, what if he Googled me after that night?
4967180	4968180	Oh yeah.
4968180	4969180	I'm coming to your wedding.
4969180	4970180	Google.
4970180	4976620	Oh, I can see through my visor.
4976620	4977620	This guy's trouble.
4977620	4982780	Who would, who would you want to have as a guest comptroller if you had any?
4982780	4983780	Brandon Johnson.
4983780	4985500	Like, what do you mean by default?
4985500	4990860	Like if I, like if I was, if I was going to, if I was about to die, you were saying
4990860	4998380	like, we had a great, sweet, sweet, sweet, like none of all these fabulous people on
4998380	4999380	my show.
4999380	5000380	Controlling.
5000380	5002380	It was just so sweet.
5002380	5004540	I don't know if that was the line reading.
5004540	5009780	It was, it was a lot made it sound like it was LaVar Burton.
5009780	5010780	Yeah.
5010780	5011780	He was hosting the show.
5011780	5012780	I understand that.
5012780	5014780	I'm, I'm saying, do you?
5015540	5016540	Yes.
5016540	5018060	He did reading rainbow.
5018060	5023700	Why do you have a lantern like an old like train conductor?
5023700	5025100	It's not even lit.
5025100	5026580	It's out of batteries.
5026580	5028020	It's out of battery.
5028020	5029020	It's out.
5029020	5030020	Okay.
5030020	5031020	Great.
5031020	5032020	That's why you have it there.
5032020	5033020	That's why I have it there.
5033020	5034020	To charge.
5034020	5035020	All right.
5035020	5038020	Lay down a beat.
5038020	5041020	Oh shit.
5041020	5060300	Yo, rhythm to the plate, rhythm has a fate, a destiny of time gone by.
5060300	5065340	I fucked your momma in her eye.
5065340	5067740	Didn't mean to bro.
5067740	5084180	I fucked a rainbow, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet.
5084180	5087900	That's the spectrum.
5087900	5090140	All the colors come in.
5090140	5100620	Rainbow strips of brothers got red talking over orange saying, yo, orange is like what?
5100620	5108300	Well, we try to get along, recognize her the same color all along because red can't be
5108300	5114700	red unless it's really dark orange.
5114700	5121860	And orange eventually has to accept that it's kind of a form of red.
5121860	5124700	That's why it's called the spectrum.
5124700	5125700	I think I assume.
5125700	5126700	I don't know.
5126700	5132900	There's probably actually a definitive delineation between those colors that is super important
5132900	5138380	scientifically, but you better prove it.
5138380	5139380	Okay.
5139380	5142380	Oh, five fingers of death.
5143380	5154380	Yo, I ate a sandwich today and this is how it went.
5154380	5156380	Tell them about your sandwich.
5156380	5160380	I ate so many sandwiches today.
5160380	5166380	I had to install an extra air vent.
5166380	5176380	I got that tempo that lets you rap good.
5176380	5181380	That lets you think about things that rhyme like wood.
5181380	5184380	Doesn't matter what you do.
5184380	5191380	I could do my taxes while I sit and think, well, that's probably going to rhyme with
5191380	5192380	taxes.
5192380	5198380	Yeah, I'm a slow rapper thinking of the words that will rhyme later.
5198380	5200380	All right.
5200380	5203380	I just wanted to give people a segment.
5203380	5208380	You had to split it just a little bit.
5208380	5210380	The things that I...
5210380	5212380	New money.
5212380	5216380	New money.
5216380	5220660	The definition of our new relationship is like whatever I do for you guys.
5220660	5227660	It's not that I resent doing it for you, but it is a favor.
5227660	5229660	It's just a slight...
5229660	5231660	Look, if it's a deal breaker, I understand.
5231660	5233660	It would be a deal breaker for me too.
5233660	5235660	I don't need you.
5235660	5239660	Can you love someone that doesn't need you?
5239660	5243660	Was your relationship reliant on my insecurity?
5243660	5246660	I will remain insecure until the day I die.
5247660	5252660	My EKG or whatever that beepy thing is that shows that you're dying, it's going to go beep.
5252660	5254660	And I'm going to go, oh God, I fucked up.
5254660	5255660	I fucked up so bad.
5255660	5256660	I fucked up everything.
5256660	5258660	I'm going to be so insecure.
5258660	5260660	I'm going to die.
5260660	5265660	I'm going to go straight to hell because it's going to be just the sum of all of the tightness
5265660	5269660	that I had and all of the resistance I had to everyone's love.
5269660	5277660	And I'm just going to forever spiral into this crazy self-created projection of torture.
5277660	5285660	So don't worry about me getting punished or being humbled or figuring out that I did something wrong.
5285660	5297660	I'm sorry that when I say something wrong, instead of saying it to three people, I say it to 300,000 people.
5297660	5301660	And therefore then there's a headline that says, Dan Harmon says something wrong.
5301660	5305660	And then when I feel bad about it, I go, hey, I feel bad about that.
5305660	5308660	And then it says, Dan Harmon feels bad about that thing.
5308660	5314660	I can understand how you as a person would be like, hmm, I think I'll examine who Dan Harmon is.
5314660	5315660	Oh, he said that?
5315660	5316660	That's fucked up.
5316660	5318660	Are you sorry about it?
5318660	5320660	Well, that should end that.
5320660	5322660	What? He said another thing?
5322660	5324660	Well, now he's sorry about that.
5324660	5326660	Where's this going?
5326660	5328660	Life is where it's going.
5328660	5330660	Life. I'm alive.
5330660	5331660	Yeah.
5331660	5333660	I'm alive. I'm dying.
5333660	5334660	Yeah.
5334660	5336660	I'm going to die in front of you.
5336660	5337660	That's the bad.
5337660	5341660	There's nothing's going to change if that's what you want to change.
5341660	5343660	I'm not going to turn into a cockroach.
5343660	5344660	Okay.
5344660	5346660	I'm not going to slowly turn into a mummy.
5346660	5348660	I mean, I am. I am.
5348660	5352660	But I'm not going to be like, watch me become sting.
5352660	5354660	Like he had a publicist.
5355660	5357660	It doesn't work the way you think it works.
5357660	5363660	If you're waiting for me to stop being a bad person,
5363660	5368660	it's like waiting for rain to taste like mint.
5368660	5371660	It's a great wish, and I back you up on it,
5371660	5373660	and it's not going to happen.
5373660	5376660	And it's your fault for waiting for it.
5376660	5379660	I know I'm late to the party,
5379660	5384660	but this British baking show is fucking great.
5384660	5389660	Have you seen the latest season with Noel Fielding?
5389660	5390660	It's really good.
5390660	5393660	I sat down, episode one,
5393660	5397660	and watched it all the way through into the end,
5397660	5400660	and I kept eating toast.
5400660	5402660	That's the one thing.
5402660	5404660	You're talking about advertising.
5404660	5406660	They don't advertise on Netflix,
5406660	5412660	but they would clean up if they had bread commercials,
5412660	5415660	because I was eating toast all day long.
5415660	5421660	I was toasting toast, which is weird.
5421660	5425660	You should say toasting bread into toast.
5425660	5427660	What is it called?
5427660	5429660	It's the British baking show.
5429660	5432660	It's just called British Bake Off.
5432660	5433660	Say again?
5433660	5435660	British Bake Off.
5435660	5438660	Does that suck? I patch nihilist?
5438660	5442660	Is that so bad?
5442660	5443660	No!
5443660	5444660	Okay.
5444660	5448660	Here's the thing that I noticed right away,
5448660	5452660	because I haven't watched a lot of reality television,
5452660	5457660	but most of the reality television I've watched is American reality TV.
5457660	5461660	And the thing about the great British Bake Off show
5462660	5464660	is everybody's so nice to each other.
5464660	5465660	They're helping each other out.
5465660	5466660	They're just going,
5466660	5467660	oh, you dropped your thing.
5467660	5468660	Let me hear it.
5468660	5469660	You can use my fork or whatever.
5469660	5470660	You want to use my oven?
5470660	5472660	They're all helping each other out.
5472660	5473660	And even the critique is like,
5473660	5477660	hmm, it's a little upside, isn't it?
5477660	5479660	It's not like, what is this?
5479660	5480660	Garbage.
5480660	5482660	It's very positive.
5482660	5488660	And I think that show would make you happy.
5489660	5493660	I like the story about that woman costing you.
5493660	5496660	Oh, you would have been in fucking hell.
5496660	5497660	You said, this will make you feel better.
5497660	5498660	And I forgot to tell you.
5498660	5499660	By the way, that did fucking...
5499660	5500660	It did, yeah.
5500660	5501660	That was insane.
5501660	5502660	Yeah.
5502660	5504660	I've been wanting to tell you for a while
5504660	5506660	because I knew it would make you so happy.
5506660	5510660	And I don't think you understand how angry and short I was
5510660	5514660	with this woman who was, in her mind, trying to save my life.
5514660	5517660	And I'm going, I don't need that.
5517660	5518660	Go back.
5518660	5519660	Get away from me.
5519660	5523660	I was being very angry and curt.
5523660	5524660	Short.
5527660	5530660	I just got endlessly fascinated with these cosmetic issues.
5530660	5531660	That's like we...
5531660	5534660	Like a man starts to lose his hair.
5534660	5535660	Me.
5535660	5537660	And then I go like, okay, I'm losing it.
5537660	5540660	But it's like there's lines between the clinical and the
5540660	5544660	cosmetic and the every day we wake up and we go through
5544660	5546660	routines and things where we go, well,
5547660	5550660	who I am is not going to work.
5550660	5551660	And I don't even mean...
5551660	5556660	I'm not going all like punk rock on you and going like,
5556660	5558660	oh, why do we wear makeup at all?
5558660	5561660	I mean like even people who don't wear makeup,
5561660	5565660	like you look in the mirror and you have this like moment
5565660	5567660	where you're like, if there's an eyebrow that's like
5567660	5570660	shooting out of my head, maybe I would clip it with scissors.
5570660	5573660	Like no matter how low maintenance you think you are.
5573660	5574660	Like you're...
5574660	5579660	And it's like, when you get a bald spot that starts to
5579660	5585660	grow in your head and it's like, it's all just like...
5585660	5586660	It's the weirdest thing.
5586660	5589660	It's this thing that I never see unless there's like,
5589660	5591660	I get a haircut and then they show me the mirror thing
5591660	5592660	and then I have this like...
5592660	5594660	I go, oh God, what's...
5594660	5596660	Is there something I can do about that?
5596660	5599660	But I don't even understand why I'm thinking that.
5599660	5601660	Like Cody doesn't express anything like,
5601660	5603660	oh boy, can you do something?
5603660	5605660	She's more aware than I am.
5605660	5607660	She's seeing in the back of my head along with the rest
5607660	5609660	of everybody like more than I am.
5609660	5611660	And then you just think like, okay, so every day
5611660	5613660	with the tweezing and the everything,
5613660	5615660	like we just kind of like...
5615660	5618660	We're like, oh God.
5618660	5619660	Is it like...
5619660	5620660	I don't know.
5620660	5621660	Sorry.
5621660	5622660	It's new.
5622660	5623660	It's a crazy thing.
5623660	5624660	It's not new.
5624660	5628660	It's old, but I'm new to it I think.
5628660	5629660	It's crazy.
5630660	5632660	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5632660	5635660	My bald friend, like I can't talk about my relationship
5635660	5637660	with baldness in front of my bald friend.
5637660	5638660	I know, I get it.
5638660	5639660	Yeah.
5639660	5640660	Didn't start losing your hair.
5640660	5641660	You can't give me a bald pass.
5641660	5642660	So you were 45.
5642660	5647660	That must have really interfered with your dating life.
5647660	5649660	You really probably did.
5649660	5650660	It's not dating life.
5650660	5653660	I have a girl I'm going to spend the rest of my life with.
5653660	5657660	I don't understand why we have feelings about our scalps.
5657660	5660660	It scares us to think maybe that's what's going on inside, too,
5660660	5661660	a little bit.
5661660	5665660	I think it scares us to go, well, we're falling apart.
5665660	5667660	We're decaying in front of the mirror.
5667660	5668660	That's what happened.
5668660	5671660	But what if your culture said that when you can start to see
5671660	5676660	a man's scalp that that was called the hardening or something?
5676660	5678660	You know, like you could...
5678660	5680660	Culture could easily...
5680660	5683660	Look at the fucked up periscopes we create for everything.
5683660	5685660	Like what does that mean?
5685660	5686660	It's like we...
5686660	5688660	But we're like, oh shit, time is passing.
5688660	5689660	That's what that means.
5689660	5691660	It means you're not 25, for sure.
5691660	5694660	Like, no matter how much you've been passing...
5694660	5695660	Passer 22.
5695660	5696660	Yes, God damn it.
5696660	5697660	You can't...
5697660	5698660	I can't talk about this around you.
5698660	5699660	No.
5699660	5700660	I get it.
5700660	5703660	You're just like a guy that's playing Uno and you have old reverse cards.
5703660	5704660	Like, I don't...
5704660	5705660	Oh, damn.
5705660	5710660	It's still a topic I'm allowed to have in my head just because someone's
5710660	5711660	balder.
5711660	5713660	That doesn't mean I can't talk about it.
5713660	5718660	I didn't say you should stop talking about this horrible problem.
5718660	5720660	I should pay the ghost!
5720660	5721660	Pay the ghost!
5721660	5722660	You should.
5722660	5723660	To put it in Nicolas Cage terms.
5723660	5724660	Pay the ghost.
5724660	5725660	Pay the ghost!
5725660	5728660	The classic Nicolas Cage movie, Pay the Ghost.
5728660	5731660	You're telling me you haven't seen Pay the Ghost?
5731660	5733660	I haven't seen Pay the Ghost.
5733660	5734660	Oh, my God.
5734660	5735660	With Andre Brouwer.
5735660	5736660	No, he said something.
5736660	5737660	He said something.
5737660	5738660	He said, pay the ghost.
5738660	5739660	Pay the ghost!
5739660	5741660	Pay the ghost!
5742660	5743660	Yeah, Pay the Ghost.
5743660	5746660	It's one of the eight Nicolas Cage movies.
5746660	5750660	Nicolas Cage in a box is a service that can come to your...
5752660	5757660	The only way to keep up with all of the movies Nicolas Cage does every day...
5757660	5758660	In a cage.
5758660	5759660	It's the Nick Cage.
5760660	5761660	It's the Nick Cage.
5761660	5762660	It comes in a handy cage.
5762660	5763660	It comes in a box.
5763660	5764660	Let me out!
5764660	5765660	Let me out!
5766660	5770660	It comes with a separate package of bees that you activate them with.
5770660	5771660	What's that?
5771660	5772660	What's that?
5772660	5773660	What is that?
5773660	5779660	Did you know that they edited the bees out of the Wicker Man in the regular cut?
5779660	5782660	Like the vanilla cut that you get on Apple TV?
5782660	5783660	Because Cody hadn't seen it.
5783660	5785660	Like, we got to watch Wicker Man.
5785660	5788660	And no fucking bees.
5791660	5795660	So they went to the screening and people were like, holy shit.
5795660	5796660	Right.
5796660	5803660	Oh no not the bees dot fucking hashtag dot com dot org dot italics.
5803660	5805660	Holy fucking trending shit.
5805660	5806660	Oh no not the bees.
5806660	5808660	And they're like, god damn it.
5808660	5810660	They're making fun of our movie.
5810660	5812660	That's the only reason why?
5812660	5813660	It's not Citizen Kane?
5813660	5814660	We got to take...
5814660	5815660	Well, we'll show them.
5815660	5817660	We'll just take that out.
5817660	5821660	Thanks for telling us how to get stronger, you rubes.
5821660	5823660	Now we're the best movie ever.
5823660	5827660	Come on, don't take the no not the bees out.
5827660	5828660	That's bullshit.
5828660	5830660	Same thing with the Battlefield Earth.
5830660	5831660	I was about to say.
5831660	5832660	A lot of shit, man.
5832660	5833660	There was a lot of...
5833660	5835660	Shrob and I saw that movie in the theater.
5835660	5838660	It was us in the front row and a lot of...
5838660	5839660	Party in the back.
5839660	5840660	Strange.
5840660	5844660	A strangely identical group of people in white polo shirts in the back that were...
5844660	5845660	They were in white polo shirts.
5845660	5848660	They were dressed like civilians but it was like half way through the movie.
5848660	5851660	A lot of applause over those opening credits.
5851660	5852660	Do you realize what's happening?
5852660	5857660	We're the only three people in this movie and the back two rows are the Church of Scientology.
5857660	5859660	We've been assigned to come see this movie.
5859660	5860660	And they're like...
5860660	5865660	Because we picked up on it after a while because John Travolta would say something and we'd
5865660	5866660	laugh.
5866660	5867660	The three of us are...
5867660	5870660	And there's no silence in the back.
5870660	5874660	And then John Travolta would say something, then they'd laugh.
5874660	5876660	And we're like, well, that wasn't funny.
5876660	5878660	That was his character making a joke.
5878660	5879660	I agree with that.
5879660	5880660	But oh, oh.
5880660	5881660	Got it.
5881660	5882660	All right.
5882660	5887660	Well, when it was based on the book by L. Ron Hubbard and they were all applauding in
5887660	5888660	the back.
5888660	5889660	We were like, ooh.
5889660	5890660	But...
5890660	5892660	And then in that movie, they were like...
5892660	5893660	There was so much more.
5893660	5894660	It was...
5894660	5896660	There was a bunch of crazy shit.
5896660	5900660	We watched it and we were telling everybody about it because there were no hashtags back
5900660	5901660	then.
5901660	5902660	We were just like going...
5902660	5905660	You had to go and hashtag each person back then.
5906660	5910660	You had to say hashtag Paul, hashtag Mary, hashtag Sebastian.
5910660	5911660	You had to like...
5911660	5914660	Every single person, you had to just text them and be like, hey, here's a thing I'd
5914660	5916660	like you to be talking about.
5917660	5918660	What is...
5918660	5919660	That's the hashtag.
5922660	5923660	And we were...
5923660	5924660	Yeah, but they were like...
5924660	5925660	Yeah.
5925660	5926660	And then they...
5926660	5927660	I didn't say...
5927660	5928660	I said I wouldn't magically agree.
5928660	5929660	I bought it on DVD and the scenes were gone.
5929660	5930660	Yeah, same with the bees.
5930660	5931660	You can only see the...
5931660	5932660	What was the saying?
5932660	5934660	What did Travolta say?
5935660	5936660	He was like...
5936660	5943660	You said you wouldn't make it appear and it did appear or whatever.
5943660	5944660	I don't know.
5944660	5945660	I can't remember.
5945660	5946660	I don't wanna...
5946660	5947660	It won't work.
5947660	5953660	Were the Scientologists just enjoying the film or was their job to make the film seem better
5953660	5957660	reacted to as an audience than it actually was?
5957660	5961660	I don't think they thought it through past like, let's just make sure there's always
5961660	5963660	at least two rows of Scientology people.
5963660	5964660	Yeah, no, that's what I mean.
5964660	5968660	Yeah, and so they didn't anticipate it in the theater and then two rows of people because...
5968660	5969660	Yeah.
5969660	5970660	But then they didn't...
5970660	5971660	So they didn't have like a...
5971660	5973660	Their flowchart stopped there.
5973660	5974660	Like they...
5974660	5975660	It wasn't like...
5975660	5977660	If you're the only two rows...
5977660	5978660	Right.
5978660	5979660	Maybe leave.
5979660	5980660	Don't...
5980660	5984660	Yeah, don't laugh at every joke because it'll seem weird to everyone but you.
5984660	5988660	Also, please don't sneak out of the church of Scientology in this movie.
5988660	5989660	Yeah.
5989660	5990660	Right.
5990660	5993340	Yeah, don't take this opportunity just because it's a dark room doesn't mean you can go out
5993340	5994340	any door you want.
5994340	6000340	You will report back to your bus and into your cryo chamber.
6000340	6008340	The bees were an important part of the wicker man.
6008340	6009340	That's it.
6009340	6010340	That's all I want to say.
6010340	6011340	If I get...
6011340	6014340	The best part of the bees thing is when he goes, wait, what's that?
6014340	6017340	He goes, what is that?
6017340	6019340	What's that buzzing?
6019340	6023020	And I said, Cody, the clip, I'm like, this is what you miss as well.
6024020	6027020	I made you watch the entire wicker man because this was supposed to be in there and it didn't
6027020	6028020	happen.
6028020	6029020	Here it is.
6029020	6030020	I sent her the YouTube link.
6030020	6031020	Did she like...
6031020	6034020	After the credits were like...
6034020	6039020	Wicker man, wicker man, wicker man.
6039020	6041020	It's Christmas.
6041020	6043020	No, don't call it a chair.
6043020	6045020	It's not something you rock in.
6045020	6047020	I've got a thread to the twigs and the spiraling in.
6047020	6049020	I've got a rabbit culture.
6049020	6051020	It's a paganistic...
6051020	6055020	And then Cody was like, I don't understand why you thought it was such a bad movie.
6055020	6056020	It was really cool.
6056020	6057020	Yeah, she really dug it.
6057020	6059020	I was like, well, you gotta see this bee scene.
6059020	6061020	It's so fucked up.
6061020	6065020	Yeah, I guess if you would add that, that would be a silly movie.
6065020	6068020	But that movie that you watched, the edited...
6068020	6071020	The vanilla version you called it, was great.
6071020	6073020	That was really good.
6073020	6075020	That was good.
6075020	6078020	I sent her to the stage and she said, do you think...
6078020	6085020	Do you think we didn't see it because we were fooling around or something like that?
6085020	6088020	And I thought it was an autocorrect typo.
6088020	6089020	And I said, do you...
6089020	6094020	Are you asking if Nicholas Cage was just trying to make the crew laugh?
6094020	6098020	Or are you asking if they were just like...
6098020	6100020	In the edit, we're just having a good time.
6100020	6102020	Oh, you mean did we start fucking...
6102020	6103020	Why are you...
6103020	6105020	You're texting her?
6105020	6107020	Is she sitting next to you?
6107020	6109020	It was later, it was the next day because I sent her to the club.
6109020	6111020	I was like, by the way, that movie is what you missed.
6111020	6117020	So the movie ended and you just ran to bed and went to sleep.
6117020	6119020	You didn't like go, this is the thing?
6119020	6121020	I said, there's no bees.
6121020	6122020	Wait, we're in for the bees, you're a beast.
6122020	6124020	Well, the movie's over.
6124020	6127020	Goodbye.
6127020	6128020	I'll text you the video.
6128020	6131020	I'll text you tomorrow.
6131020	6132020	I'm so asleep.
6132020	6133020	I'm sleeping.
6133020	6134020	I'm sleeping.
6134020	6135020	I'm sleeping.
6135020	6136020	Honey, I want to see the bees.
6136020	6140020	Okay, I'm asleep.
6140020	6144020	I'll race you to tomorrow.
6144020	6145020	I got there first.
6145020	6152020	If you were listening to the story, the subtext there was that the movie, we didn't make it to the end.
6152020	6153020	We were...
6153020	6158020	Because of my active love life.
6158020	6160020	Mm-hmm.
6160020	6164020	Oh, okay, sure.
6164020	6165020	Nice.
6165020	6171020	So you watched, you didn't watch until the end of the movie looking at you.
6171020	6178020	He was burning to death and I was probably like, I was probably doing a really good job of like fucking...
6178020	6179020	You know?
6179020	6180020	I was like...
6180020	6181020	Oh, God.
6181020	6184020	Do we have to hear about how good you eat pussy again?
6184020	6185020	I ate it so good.
6185020	6193020	Do we have to sit through another nine-hour dissertation on how good Dan Harmon eats pussy?
6193020	6197020	I've been hearing this story since you were 19.
6197020	6205020	Oh, I eat it like a small dick, but I eat pussy so fucking good.
6205020	6207020	Rob Shropp, ladies and gentlemen.
6207020	6208020	I have no complaints, Dan.
6208020	6209020	Worth every penny.
6209020	6210020	Why they come?
6210020	6214020	They keep coming because I eat so much fucking good pussy.
6214020	6219020	I'm not going to feel bad about having a small dick on top of everything else.
6219020	6221020	But you eat pussy so good.
6221020	6223020	I'm sorry you picked up on the fact that I...
6223020	6224020	I picked up.
6224020	6228020	You're reminding everybody every five fucking seconds.
6228020	6229020	If I got...
6229020	6232020	I ate pussy good again.
6232020	6234020	Dan uses the story circle.
6234020	6235020	What did you do Labor Day?
6235020	6238020	I ate pussy good.
6238020	6239020	That's not true.
6239020	6240020	That's not true.
6240020	6241020	In-laws.
6241020	6243020	That's not true.
6243020	6247020	The only thing that's true about that is that I'm transparent about not having a...
6247020	6252020	I'm not a shower or a grower, frankly.
6252020	6254020	The truth is you could wait all night.
6254020	6255020	Like, it's not grow...
6255020	6257020	It'll grow and then you're like, really?
6257020	6258020	Okay.
6258020	6259020	So...
6259020	6262020	But the jamming out is I eat the pussy so good.
6262020	6263020	I don't know what else.
6263020	6265020	Like, you go home and look it up.
6265020	6267020	Go look it up on the whip.
6267020	6270020	It'll tell you I ate pussy good.
6270020	6275020	I don't know what else anyone would expect me to be good at given my situation,
6275020	6276020	but I...
6276020	6280020	And so I'm not gonna be like, I'm terrible at eating pussy.
6280020	6281020	I don't know.
6281020	6282020	All right?
6282020	6283020	That's fair.
6283020	6285020	But I don't brag about it.
6285020	6286020	I'm probably great at it.
6286020	6287020	I gotta be great at it.
6287020	6288020	Oh, my God.
6288020	6289020	See?
6289020	6290020	This is how you get it.
6290020	6291020	I must be.
6291020	6292020	My dick is so small.
6292020	6295020	Like, I must be amazing.
6295020	6298020	Like, look at the women that have stayed with me for more than a year.
6298020	6299020	Two in fact.
6299020	6301020	Like, they gotta be getting something.
6302020	6304020	Like, it's...
6304020	6307020	And of course, whenever I ask, they always say it's great.
6307020	6309020	So who would do that?
6309020	6311020	Oh, I just heard an aww.
6313020	6314020	God damn it.
6316020	6317020	That was my joke.
6317020	6318020	It was good.
6318020	6321020	I'm well aware that if someone asked you, did I eat your pussy good,
6321020	6323020	you would probably say yes, whether he did or didn't.
6323020	6327020	See, the job, the secret is that you spell the alphabet.
6327020	6329020	She got the joke.
6330020	6332020	I mean, if a motherfucker bakes a pie
6332020	6334020	and it takes, like, 18 ingredients and they burn it,
6334020	6337020	you still gonna be like, this is delicious.
6338020	6339020	Give me a beat.
6341020	6342020	Talk about this pussy.
6343020	6344020	We're gonna train off, though, right?
6344020	6345020	For the closing number?
6345020	6346020	Yeah.
6346020	6347020	Right. Old school.
6347020	6348020	Are we old school?
6348020	6349020	Yeah.
6349020	6350020	All right.
6352020	6354020	I'll do the sound to the sound sample.
6355020	6359020	Oh, I love to eat that pussy.
6360020	6363020	It's like an old forgotten Motown song.
6363020	6365020	Yeah, seriously.
6365020	6368020	Oh, I love to eat that pussy.
6368020	6370020	She's stopping over.
6370020	6372020	I'm finna eat that pussy like a trash can,
6372020	6373020	the home to Grover.
6373020	6375020	That's what that sounds like.
6375020	6376020	Grover eating pussy.
6376020	6380020	You finna rock the pussy like you was rocking Stussy.
6380020	6382020	I'm passing it to you.
6382020	6385020	You two and old style, like we used to do.
6385020	6386020	Bless it, yo.
6386020	6389020	First you take your tongue and then you run it up and down
6389020	6391020	like a marathon run, son.
6391020	6395020	I'm gonna go the distance up to the clitoris-tus.
6395020	6398020	I'm gonna make you come like this and then this.
6398020	6401020	I'm putting my tongue inside and rubbing it around
6401020	6403020	like my name was Rawhide.
6403020	6404020	Pussy?
6406020	6407020	I know.
6407020	6409020	There's no language that's gonna go good with this.
6409020	6410020	Pussy?
6410020	6413020	If you're waiting for descriptions of pussy eatin' sick
6413020	6422020	becomes somehow attractive to reactive to the fact,
6422020	6425020	the fundamental fact, the talking about it,
6425020	6428020	like it's a competition, makes it bad.
6428020	6430020	But anyways, where was I?
6430020	6435020	I licked her momma's pussy so hard I got a fuzzy eye.
6435020	6438020	I tried looking inside like a periscope
6438020	6440020	because she opened her mouth wide.
6440020	6443020	And so I saw an enemy sub, Red October, coming around.
6443020	6446020	I said, rub-a-dub-dub, because I was in the bathtub
6446020	6448020	with your momma eating her out.
6448020	6449020	Oh, shit.
6449020	6452020	Here comes Commander Cloud.
6452020	6453020	Nice.
6453020	6455020	Raw deal.
6455020	6458020	I'm gonna eat that pussy like Camille.
6458020	6460020	I licked it down with your poop.
6460020	6461020	I love to eat the fu-
6461020	6463020	My favorite food group.
6463020	6467020	I drop a mic, but I don't drop a verse.
6467020	6472020	I almost died to get a fucking hearse.
6472020	6475020	Ladies and gentlemen, that has been Hormontown.
6475020	6477020	We out there eating that pussy.
6477020	6480020	Rob Schwab, Spencer Crinton, knowledge from Rika
6480020	6483020	sitting in for the lovely Steve Levy.
6483020	6485020	LaShayner Tova, Happy New Year.
6485020	6488020	Zach McKeever, Chris Borf, Sarah Hill.
6488020	6493020	Thank you so much from the Downtown Dynasty Theater.
6493020	6495020	We love you, Jeff Davis.
6495020	6496020	We miss you so much.
6496020	6497020	I've been Brandon Johnson.
6497020	6498020	Good night.
6498020	6501020	Two-time Emmy winner, ladies and gentlemen.
6520020	6522020	Did you get any of that?
6522020	6525020	It's a good show.
