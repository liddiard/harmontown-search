0	20840	Ladies and gentlemen, Harmontown is now in session.
20840	29840	Please put it together for the mayor of Harmontown, the smooth style of Dan Harmontown.
29840	30840	Harmontown!
30840	44440	I thought they were going to keep it going.
44440	45440	Wait, that was it?
45440	49640	Oh no, not you guys, sorry.
49640	50640	The beat.
50640	54840	You know what, I picked a beat that was only about 40 seconds long.
54840	56840	I thought we decided last...
56840	57840	Alright, what do we got?
57840	58840	Let's see what this is.
58840	62840	We decided last week and it's always good to...
62840	63840	Yeah.
63840	64840	Yeah.
64840	65840	Yo.
65840	66840	Yo.
66840	67840	Yeah.
67840	68840	Yeah.
68840	69840	Yeah.
69840	70840	Smooth.
70840	71840	Wait for it.
71840	72840	Yo.
72840	74840	Yeah, the anticipation makes it better.
74840	78840	I represent the motherfuckers and fuck your mama's titty.
78840	81840	I do it in every nation, every state in every city.
81840	84840	A lick her pussy and put her head in the ground.
84840	87840	I fucked your mama because her ass is lost and found.
87840	90840	Nuts in a barrel, got my dick in a shoe.
90840	91840	Wait, I can't...
91840	92840	I can't hear the beat.
92840	94840	What am I going to do?
94840	96840	Start over.
96840	97840	Yo.
97840	98840	Yo.
98840	99840	Yo.
99840	100840	Yo.
100840	101840	Let me reset.
101840	102840	Yo.
102840	103840	Yo.
103840	105840	I fucked your mama on the North Pole and the South.
105840	108840	I fucked your mama on her titty nipples and her mouth.
108840	111840	I fucked your mama and her thighs so hard she cried.
111840	114840	I fucked your mama and told her that I didn't try.
114840	117840	I fucked your mama on the foot and her hat.
117840	120840	I fucked your mama while I read Cat in the Hat.
120840	123840	Dr. Seuss traumatized her childhood.
123840	127840	I tried to fuck your mama in Idlewood.
127840	129840	I fucked your mama.
129840	130840	Yeah.
130840	132840	I fucked your mama.
132840	135840	She gave birth to you and now I fucked her.
135840	140840	So that means that you are subservient to me.
140840	148840	The progenitor of your life got fucked with my flesh knife.
148840	151840	Oh no.
151840	153840	Sorry.
153840	154840	Sorry.
154840	155840	Sorry.
155840	159840	I'm so sorry about that imagery.
159840	163840	Don't want to be like Kevin Spacey.
163840	166840	That seven shit, don't clap.
166840	168840	Alright, that's some sloppy shit.
168840	173840	Yo, it's everyone's fault but mine.
173840	177840	Also, I'm a little congested and I can't hear.
177840	179840	Look, I picked the shitty beat too.
179840	182840	That's on my bad cometrolling over here.
182840	184840	We'll find some other beats.
184840	191840	Last week, it hasn't aired yet, but we fucking dropped some mad science.
191840	194840	It was 90 straight minutes of just rapping.
194840	196840	A lot of mamas got fucked.
196840	198840	A lot of mamas got fucked and some daddies got fucked.
198840	200840	You put a couple daddies in there too.
200840	202840	Time got traveled in.
202840	206840	Yeah, and thankfully there was no mention of your flesh knife.
206840	208840	That was the worst.
208840	210840	A flesh knife.
210840	214840	That put me off of myself.
214840	219840	I was the first among you to assume that the crossing of the threshold would be the n-word.
219840	222840	That I would eventually just go east coast nigga.
222840	224840	Oh shit, sorry.
224840	227840	No, flesh knife is where I went too far.
227840	229840	East coast nigga is forgivable.
229840	231840	It's part of the style.
231840	234840	Shakespeare made up a lot of words too.
234840	237840	Obviously, there's some black people in the audience that are going to go,
237840	240840	oh, he's talking about me.
240840	242840	There's a little bit of wiggle room there.
242840	244840	But flesh knife, no.
244840	248840	All races, all genders, Martians are going, you're gross.
248840	250840	Grody, the bad person.
250840	251840	Flesh knife.
251840	253840	Flesh knife.
254840	257840	I'm, right, I'll give you the full report.
257840	259840	Whatever you want.
259840	261840	In no necessary order.
261840	265840	People say in conversation, how are you doing?
265840	267840	You don't want an honest answer.
267840	269840	It's very confusing.
269840	272840	My head is incredibly congested.
272840	279840	So if I'm speaking too loudly, I can't, that's what's happening.
280840	282840	Everyone got the cold over Thanksgiving, right?
282840	283840	Did everyone get it?
283840	284840	Did anyone not get it?
284840	287840	Is there anyone in the room that didn't get a cold?
287840	289840	All right.
289840	290840	This is what happened.
290840	297840	The moon raker species will take them up into space and inject colds into them.
297840	300840	I don't know.
300840	302840	Congratulations, assholes.
302840	305840	But the rest of us had a horrible cold.
305840	308840	Just an irritating one, not horrible.
308840	310840	My head is, I'm over the cold.
310840	311840	I'm not contagious.
311840	312840	I'm not sneezing.
312840	313840	I'm not coughing.
313840	314840	I'm not doing anything.
314840	317840	But I can't, my head is filled with snot.
317840	320840	It's just, like, it's just filled.
320840	321840	It's almost comforting.
321840	324840	Like, if I didn't have to do a shove, I didn't have to communicate with anyone.
324840	327840	I would be kind of, you know, it's a cocoon.
327840	331840	Would you say it's kind of an impenetrable, like, layer of snot up there?
331840	332840	Yeah, yeah.
332840	340840	I wonder if we could find some sort of tool to penetrate that snot.
340840	341840	Maybe a flush knife?
341840	343840	Flush knife?
343840	345840	Dan, fuck your nose.
345840	349840	Just start fucking your nose with that sweet flush knife.
349840	359840	I have a hand for my comptroller, Long Walk Short Pearson.
359840	361840	He was trained at the Academy of...
361840	362840	I'm Scottish.
362840	365840	Anti-payoff.
365840	368840	I'm not letting you off last night.
368840	369840	I can't.
369840	374840	I feel, you know, when you get on a plane and your ears don't pop, like, or you go underwater
374840	377840	and there's water in your ears, like, I'm dealing with that.
377840	384840	So if you think at any point tonight that I'm doing a bad job, take a step back and actually
384840	385840	just admire me.
385840	386840	You know what, Dan?
386840	387840	I deserve it.
387840	390840	Dan, this is not me trying to throw a curveball at you.
390840	391840	It's not me trying to throw, like, a lob.
391840	395840	Just to test where you're at mentally, vocally, you're hearing right now.
395840	399840	Those beats I gave you to start off were a little not really in the wheelhouse.
399840	400840	Let's just put some...
400840	401840	Let's put the...
401840	405840	Let's tee the golf ball up pretty high just to test where you're at right now, just to
405840	407840	kind of get an idea.
407840	408840	You mean...
408840	410840	You mean my beats or...
410840	413840	Oh, shit.
414840	417840	Oh, it's my...
417840	420840	My head is filled with snot.
420840	424840	I don't know what I'm doing and I don't know what I got.
424840	432840	I got a head full of mucus because I have a cold.
432840	434840	Wait for it.
434840	437840	It was already hard to hear, people.
437840	440840	I'm 39 years old.
440840	442840	Yeah, you're there.
442840	444840	Yeah, all right.
444840	447840	That was less impressive than it should have been.
447840	449840	I'm 39 years old.
449840	450840	I've just been handed a beat.
450840	451840	You want to try that out?
451840	452840	Should we save it up?
452840	453840	All right.
453840	454840	Come on.
454840	455840	All right.
455840	456840	Let's see what we got here.
456840	457840	Hand it to me by Kyle, right?
457840	458840	Thank you, Kyle.
458840	460840	Kyle brings us this.
463840	464840	Uh-oh.
467840	468840	Yo.
469840	470840	Yo.
471840	472840	Yo.
473840	474840	Yo.
474840	475840	Apparently...
475840	476840	Yo.
476840	480840	I hear them saints come marching in.
480840	483840	I hear them saints come marching in.
483840	484840	Yo.
484840	485840	Yo.
485840	486840	Yo.
486840	487840	I want...
487840	489840	I want a beat in the motherfucking number, nigga.
489840	490840	Yeah.
490840	492840	Where the saints come marching in.
492840	493840	Dig it.
493840	494840	Dig it.
494840	495840	Dig it.
495840	496840	Dig it.
496840	497840	That's ridiculous.
497840	499840	That's a sound effects album.
499840	500840	That was the...
500840	501840	Kyle.
501840	503840	That was track three marching band falling downstairs.
503840	505840	Back to the drawing board, Kyle.
505840	506840	This is a real grab bag right now.
506840	508840	We don't know what we're going to get.
509840	510840	All right.
510840	511840	Let's not...
511840	514840	So, you know, God works in wonderful, mysterious ways.
514840	515840	He didn't want...
515840	517840	Last week I came up.
517840	519840	Started freestyling.
519840	521840	Ninety minutes of fucking just mad fire.
521840	523840	I was just spitting everywhere.
523840	524840	Comedy gold.
524840	525840	Just not...
525840	526840	You don't have any comedy.
526840	527840	Cultural gold.
528840	529840	It's fucking like...
529840	530840	You wouldn't believe it.
530840	534840	When you hear it, if you disagree, then I won't be around.
534840	539840	And so, of course, you think, well, do it again.
539840	540840	No.
540840	542840	God says...
542840	544840	Like, stay on target, man.
544840	547840	Just like every episode should be different.
550840	554840	And on that note, we have been trying for a...
554840	556840	I think a period of four weeks now.
556840	559840	Because I tried to...
559840	564840	It was like, oh, in the Dungeons and Dragons game, we're going to meet my dad.
564840	566840	So we tried to get Eric Idle.
566840	569840	And then we tried to get our friend from the drawing room.
569840	570840	And then we...
570840	572840	We called everybody today.
572840	575840	And then we got down to just like, okay, no more old people.
575840	577840	Like, who do we know that just performs things?
577840	580840	And in the green room tonight...
580840	582840	Just now, left moments ago.
582840	585840	We had Elijah from Vampire Diaries, Daniel Gillies.
586840	587840	Ladies? Come on, ladies.
587840	588840	One lady.
588840	589840	One vampire clapping.
589840	591840	Might have been a dude.
591840	594840	He's my age and shorter than me.
594840	597840	But he was going to play my dad.
597840	599840	Horrible food poisoning.
599840	603840	Ran out of the comic book store, spraying shit out of his ass.
603840	606840	Least sexy thing you've ever seen in your life.
606840	609840	Whatever network Vampire Diaries is on, you should fire him.
609840	611840	He didn't look like a vampire to me.
611840	612840	Look like a...
612840	614840	Look like a hovercraft.
616840	619840	Put him on a network that's into that shit.
619840	621840	He's also on NBC's Saving Hope.
621840	623840	Saving Hope.
623840	626840	Which is the prequel to Raising Hope.
630840	634840	When baby books made it possible to name your daughter Hope,
634840	638840	they didn't know the indirect result would be a bunch of shows and movies
638840	642840	with Hope as a word with an ING before it.
642840	644840	Pretty clever.
644840	645840	I get it.
645840	647840	Her name's Hope.
647840	653840	Go fuck yourself.
654840	662840	If your show is named Anything Hope, go fuck yourself.
663840	666840	Furthermore, go fuck yourself.
667840	673840	If the title of your Anything begins with a gerund.
674840	677840	Raising, cooking, kidnapping, cook...
677840	678840	Boxing?
678840	679840	Yeah.
680840	681840	Enough.
681840	682840	Enough.
682840	683840	Sorry.
683840	684840	Dumb.
684840	686840	Like, don't reject it.
686840	690840	If you're involved in the entertainment industry and someone proposes it,
690840	692840	go stop it.
692840	694840	It's your responsibility.
694840	697840	I started off tonight on a bitter note.
697840	699840	I'm telling you about my mucus in my head,
699840	701840	and now I'm angry and I'm yelling at people.
701840	705840	I'm talking about New Zealand actors with shit coming out of their ass.
705840	709840	New Zealand actors that we promised we wouldn't talk about the shit coming out of his ass.
709840	711840	That was the joke that I promised him.
711840	715840	I was like, no, I'll be very delicate about why you left.
718840	720840	Scary ghosts.
721840	724840	You got vampire diarrhea on that one, man.
724840	728840	The poster on the back wall just fell down as he...
730840	732840	Vampires are friends with ghosts.
733840	736840	We learned that from cereal boxes.
737840	740840	I don't know, you're just asking for it now by doing that.
740840	742840	That ain't staying up there.
742840	744840	Oh, Kyle...
744840	745840	I don't know if you heard that.
745840	748840	He said, I got another beat, it's real weird.
749840	752840	Let's give it one more try. What could go wrong?
752840	754840	Let's do a little rap.
756840	759840	Did you guys hear Chevy Chase got fired from...
764840	766840	I don't know how to...
766840	769840	Do you look at that and go, how am I supposed to feel?
769840	771840	I feel the exact same way.
772840	774840	You need a new word?
774840	776840	Fine, fuck you.
777840	780840	What the fuck are you, Lee?
782840	784840	Whose side am I on?
786840	787840	We should get him on the show.
787840	788840	I almost called him.
788840	790840	God, he should play your father at D&D.
790840	791840	I almost called him.
795840	796840	Let's call him right now.
796840	797840	Call him right now.
800840	801840	He won't answer.
805840	806840	He won't answer because...
806840	808840	I'm calling Chevy Chase up.
808840	811840	He's taking out his phone.
811840	816840	He's had 10 bottles of wine, so he's probably home alone.
816840	821840	Waiting for Dan Harmon to play some D&D.
823840	825840	All right, well, what's the phone guy?
825840	828840	Does he ask him if he'll come on the show and play Dungeons & Dragons with us?
828840	832840	If he will, then do we skip tonight Dungeons & Dragons because then he's going to play my dad?
832840	834840	This guy, I'm telling you, he's a psychopath.
834840	836840	Let's cross that bridge after the phone.
836840	837840	Okay.
837840	838840	All right, fine.
840840	841840	All right.
841840	843840	Everybody be cool.
845840	847840	My parents are coming, huh?
847840	849840	Just don't fucking laugh.
849840	850840	No laughter?
850840	856840	Unless I tell him that there's 80 people here.
858840	859840	Let's see, how do you...
859840	861840	I got a new phone and I don't...
861840	862840	It's pretty big.
862840	864840	I don't know how to work it.
864840	867840	I bet he has the same phone.
867840	868840	I don't...
868840	869840	Okay.
869840	870840	Okay, there we go.
870840	872840	You guys are going to end up best friends, aren't you?
872840	873840	Well, we already were.
873840	875840	We're the same person.
876840	879840	Both got fired by NBC.
880840	883840	Yeah, we have more in common now than ever.
884840	886840	Come on, Chevy.
892840	894840	I don't know where the speaker is.
896840	897840	It's 8.27.
897840	898840	I mean, at this...
898840	900840	This is rape time for him.
901840	904840	He's raping, raping people.
909840	910840	There you go.
911840	912840	Hi, this is Chevy.
912840	914840	I'm not near the phone right now.
914840	916840	Please leave a message or I'll get right back to you.
917840	919840	At the tone, please record your message.
919840	923840	When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options.
926840	928840	Hello, this is Mr. Henderson.
929840	930840	Oh, shit, you have caller ID.
931840	932840	This is Dan Harmon.
932840	937840	I wanted to know if you wanted to come play Dungeons and Dragons at my Harmon Town podcast
937840	939840	now that we're both looking for work.
940840	942840	Come down.
943840	946840	I'm on stage right now and there's 80 people listening, but you're used to that.
947840	948840	I wanted to call you and reach out to you.
948840	954840	I'm sorry it happened to you, too, and I love you, and I love your vagina.
955840	956840	That's his comedy.
957840	958840	Call me back.
959840	960840	3-2-3...
960840	961840	Wait, no.
964840	965840	It's 3-2-3.
965840	966840	5-5-5.
966840	967840	I love you.
967840	968840	I'm sorry for everything.
968840	969840	Call me back.
970840	971840	All right.
973840	975840	That's an appropriate response.
976840	977840	All right.
977840	979840	Let's call Barack Obama.
983840	984840	Yo.
984840	985840	Yo.
985840	986840	Yo.
986840	987840	Yo.
987840	988840	Yo.
988840	989840	Yo.
989840	990840	Yo.
990840	991840	Yo.
991840	992840	Yo.
992840	993840	One, two, three.
993840	995840	A jiggy bottom's got a figgy pudding hat.
995840	997840	I put your mama in a dog and fucked your cat.
997840	1000840	I fucked your daddy in the front lawn, too.
1000840	1002840	I fucked your mama till she turned into glue.
1002840	1003840	I fucked your mama.
1004840	1007840	Went down her house, fucked her pussy till it turned into a mouse.
1007840	1009840	Took the mouse and put it in my shoe.
1009840	1013840	Took my shoe off, threw it into the blue sky.
1014840	1015840	That is her eye.
1015840	1016840	Your mama's the sky.
1016840	1017840	She's Lady Gaia.
1017840	1020840	You know, I fucked your mama in the nose and her tooth.
1020840	1022840	I fucked your mama because that's the truth.
1022840	1023840	I fucked your mama.
1024840	1025840	Oh.
1025840	1026840	Oh.
1026840	1027840	Yo.
1027840	1029840	There are 700 kinds of mamas.
1030840	1034840	Science calls them Maternus delectus.
1035840	1036840	No.
1036840	1037840	No.
1037840	1038840	No.
1038840	1039840	No.
1039840	1040840	No.
1040840	1041840	No.
1042840	1043840	Yo.
1043840	1044840	Yo.
1044840	1045840	I did not have relations with...
1045840	1046840	I did not have...
1046840	1048840	I did not have relations with that woman.
1048840	1052840	The only thing you have to fear is fear itself.
1053840	1055840	I fucked your mama in a puppet in the church.
1055840	1058840	I fucked your mama and I had to make a search.
1058840	1060840	I went to Google and I searched for a titty.
1060840	1063840	I looked for your mama's chest in the city.
1063840	1065840	I turned her across...
1065840	1066840	Fuck you.
1066840	1067840	Fuck.
1067840	1070840	I got a little flustered, but...
1070840	1073840	But I swear to God I fucked your mama.
1074840	1076840	I fucked her hard.
1076840	1078840	Fucked her in the prison yard.
1078840	1081840	Walking Dead Season 3 fucked her everywhere.
1083840	1086840	Fucking Dead Season 3 fucked her everywhere.
1088840	1091840	Walking Dead Season 3 fucked her everywhere.
1093840	1094840	Yeah.
1095840	1097840	Well, that was...
1097840	1099840	That was all right.
1100840	1101840	That was pretty good.
1101840	1102840	It's new.
1102840	1105840	That was an accurate description that Kyle used.
1105840	1107840	When I got a new beat, it's...
1107840	1108840	It's pretty weird.
1108840	1109840	Weird.
1110840	1112840	Now, Dan, keep your phone handy.
1112840	1114840	Have it on Ring.
1114840	1118840	Because if Chevy calls back, we want this ready to go.
1120840	1123840	I mean, honestly, I never...
1123840	1126840	You know, people don't understand that...
1128840	1130840	We never really...
1130840	1132840	He did that thing and I hated him for it.
1132840	1135840	It was very difficult to work with, but that wasn't...
1135840	1138840	That wasn't why I got fired and I didn't...
1138840	1141840	He and I were peas in a pod.
1141840	1143840	Peas in a psychotic pod.
1144840	1148840	It wasn't the entire time all of that, like, hullabaloo was happening.
1148840	1152840	He and I were texting each other stupid, like, vagina jokes and stuff.
1152840	1155840	He's a child like me. He's fine.
1155840	1156840	He's just, whatever.
1156840	1160840	I wouldn't trust him with my children or a sandwich.
1161840	1164840	I wouldn't leave him alone with a wine cork.
1164840	1166840	But I have no...
1166840	1172840	Do you think he would settle in and embrace what it is to play Dungeons and Dragons?
1172840	1173840	Do you think he would get that?
1173840	1176840	No, he can't embrace his own shoe.
1177840	1180840	It's the one that you threw into the blue.
1183840	1187840	We're all headed. He's very confused by everything.
1188840	1190840	It's going to happen to all of us.
1190840	1193840	I'm getting increasingly confused by everything.
1193840	1195840	I still don't know how to use Reddit.
1195840	1198840	I've been lurking for six months.
1198840	1202840	I finally worked up the nerve to make a little post and a community thing.
1202840	1204840	I thought you'd done it before. I thought you'd do your little...
1204840	1207840	Well, I do those... Excuse me. That's gross. I burped.
1207840	1211840	I've done two of the AMAs. They ask me anything.
1211840	1214840	But that's, like, a formal... Those are even hard to navigate.
1214840	1217840	But I'm saying, like, that community, like, you know, you...
1217840	1220840	You know, the idea of you leaving a comment, I don't know.
1220840	1223840	You know, it's a new environment for an old man.
1224840	1228840	So I replied to somebody saying something about community last night
1228840	1231840	while I was procrastinating writing.
1231840	1233840	And you could just sense...
1233840	1235840	In my mind, it was like,
1235840	1238840	Oh, it's Dan Harmon. Oh, it's Dan Harmon.
1238840	1240840	Like, how sad.
1240840	1243840	This is where we gather to talk about a show that's...
1243840	1246840	Like, now he... That's kind of sad.
1246840	1249840	It's like Mr. Hooper's ghost showing up.
1249840	1252840	It's just kind of like simultaneous, like, oh, cool.
1252840	1255840	And then, time to go.
1255840	1258840	Like, he's hanging out.
1258840	1260840	Like, if you went to a Ghostbusters party
1260840	1263840	and, like, Ray Parker Jr. was there,
1263840	1265840	it's just like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
1265840	1267840	Who you gonna call?
1267840	1270840	And you're like, ha, ha, ha, Ghostbusters.
1270840	1273840	Holy shit. Get the car.
1273840	1276840	What the fuck?
1276840	1280840	I pictured this guy having a wife and children at this point.
1280840	1283840	Uh, he ain't afraid of no ghosts.
1283840	1287840	Why is he afraid of creating a life for himself?
1295840	1297840	Wait. Oh.
1297840	1299840	That's a new thing happening.
1299840	1302840	It's a very delightful happening stage left.
1302840	1304840	Is this your first time here?
1304840	1305840	Yeah.
1305840	1306840	All right. What's your name?
1306840	1307840	My name's Big Red.
1307840	1309840	Big Red.
1310840	1312840	I love your beverage.
1312840	1316840	That's the only thing you didn't have to say.
1316840	1317840	If you had been Marcus, you'd be like,
1317840	1320840	wow, Big Red's name is Marcus.
1320840	1322840	He's a giant redhead.
1322840	1324840	My name's Big Red.
1324840	1327840	It's exhilarating when someone does that
1327840	1329840	when they affirm your perception.
1329840	1333840	Big Red, do you want to come up and talk into the microphone?
1333840	1335840	Or does that terrify you?
1335840	1337840	We don't bully people here.
1337840	1339840	Yeah, let's meet Big Red.
1339840	1341840	Let's walk up Big Red of the stage.
1346840	1350840	I've been sucking off your energy for the first 10 minutes of the show.
1350840	1352840	Like, you're a great laugher.
1352840	1354840	Like, he's very happy to be here.
1354840	1356840	Thank you. I'm really excited.
1356840	1358840	And it's hard to fake sincerity.
1358840	1360840	I mean, this guy is happy to be here.
1360840	1362840	And it's been filling me up.
1362840	1364840	You guys are a bunch of assholes.
1364840	1367840	You don't know a decent rap from a whole.
1367840	1368840	No, I'm kidding.
1368840	1371840	Big Red, can we ask your real name?
1371840	1373840	Yeah, my real name is Adam.
1373840	1375840	Are you from L.A.?
1375840	1379840	I'm originally from San Jose, but I'm going to school at Azusa.
1379840	1380840	Azusa?
1380840	1381840	Azusa Pacific University.
1381840	1382840	I don't know where that is.
1382840	1384840	It's around here somewhere.
1384840	1386840	So you...
1386840	1388840	Wait, I'm such a bad interviewer.
1388840	1390840	Please forgive me.
1390840	1393840	Because now you've said three things that I have to keep track of.
1393840	1395840	Oh, that's better. Thanks.
1395840	1397840	You grew up where?
1397840	1398840	San Jose, California.
1398840	1399840	All right. Where's that?
1399840	1400840	It's up north.
1400840	1401840	Okay.
1401840	1402840	It's by San Francisco.
1402840	1407840	And so you came here to this area because this Azusa place is near where we are somewhere?
1407840	1411840	No, I was in West Virginia, but I got drunk all the time and had to come here.
1411840	1412840	All right.
1412840	1414840	Were you drinking moonshine up in the hills?
1414840	1415840	Oh, all the time.
1415840	1416840	For real?
1416840	1417840	Yeah.
1417840	1419840	I was just in Morgantown. I loved it there.
1419840	1420840	Well, you know what he's talking about.
1420840	1421840	Oh, Morgantown's great.
1421840	1423840	Are you from there or where are you from?
1423840	1426840	Well, I'm originally from San Jose, but I lived in a...
1426840	1427840	I mean, I got that part.
1427840	1428840	I went to a Podank town.
1428840	1430840	I wasn't listening. I was fixing your mic.
1430840	1432840	It was a Podank town in Eastern Panhandle.
1432840	1433840	Podank?
1433840	1434840	Yeah.
1434840	1435840	That's one step below Podunk.
1435840	1437840	Yeah, it's one step below.
1437840	1438840	Yeah, it smells worse.
1438840	1439840	Yeah, yeah.
1439840	1443840	Now, I was outside of Morgantown and I was hungover.
1443840	1446840	We're getting on the tour bus leaving town.
1446840	1450840	And my favorite thing when I'm on the road for a hangover is a strawberry shake.
1450840	1453840	And we were at a gas station and there was a Shoney's.
1453840	1454840	You're familiar with Shoney's?
1454840	1455840	Yeah, Shoney's.
1455840	1457840	It's kind of like what Denny's is here, maybe, or...
1457840	1459840	Yeah, it's like Denny's, but old people and drunks are there all the time.
1459840	1460840	Yes, precisely.
1460840	1461840	Yeah.
1461840	1462840	Yeah.
1462840	1463840	Denny's.
1463840	1465840	And I walked in there and it was like a game day for the...
1465840	1466840	What are they? The Mountaineers?
1466840	1467840	Yeah, Mountaineers, WVU.
1467840	1468840	I walked in there.
1468840	1469840	There's a bunch of old ladies.
1469840	1471840	I fucking like Big Red a lot, by the way.
1471840	1472840	This is it.
1472840	1473840	I like you, too.
1473840	1474840	I like you, too.
1474840	1477840	I want the podcasting public to know the visual, too.
1477840	1483840	Like every time he speaks into the microphone, he kind of leans and twists into it
1483840	1485840	with a big smile on his face.
1485840	1490840	Like the most enthusiastic grocery store manager in the world, like...
1490840	1492840	I worked at a grocery store for a while.
1492840	1494840	Requesting whatever the opposite of a cleanup is.
1494840	1496840	And I just go, yes, that's correct.
1496840	1501840	I don't know how to present it orally for the people that are watching it.
1501840	1502840	What did you do at the grocery store?
1502840	1504840	I bagged groceries and cleaned up crap.
1504840	1505840	Yeah.
1505840	1506840	I worked at a Trader Joe's one time.
1506840	1507840	That's what they make you do.
1507840	1508840	Yeah.
1508840	1510840	I had to wash the bloody toilets of the fucking Trader Joe's.
1510840	1512840	Oh, and one time I walked in and there was shit everywhere.
1512840	1513840	Yeah.
1513840	1514840	Yeah.
1514840	1515840	Like it was on the walls and the ceiling.
1515840	1516840	Yes.
1516840	1517840	I went to an Albertsons recently.
1517840	1520840	I had to take a monster pee and I also had to buy...
1520840	1522840	Was Daniel Gillies from Vampire Diaries there?
1522840	1523840	I don't know.
1523840	1524840	That guy shits.
1524840	1525840	That guy shits everywhere.
1525840	1531840	I didn't even know you were allowed to pee in an Albertsons or a grocery store.
1531840	1533840	You got to walk back to the plastic flaps.
1533840	1534840	There's a place.
1534840	1539340	Like when you have to pee that bad, you suddenly find out that there's pee places and places
1539340	1540340	that you don't associate with peeing.
1540340	1541340	It's in the back.
1541340	1542340	It looks like you're in prison almost.
1542340	1543340	There are the eggs.
1543340	1544340	Yeah.
1544340	1545580	It's back there.
1545580	1548380	But you know how to find it when your bladder is guiding you.
1548380	1555060	But there was a sign on the men's room door and it was written in like half pen, but then
1555060	1556060	the pen ran out.
1556060	1561300	They finished it with yellow highlighter and it just barely said out of order.
1561300	1563020	And I was like, fuck you out of order.
1563020	1564100	And I opened the door.
1564100	1570120	That shit was out of order by Albertsons standards.
1570120	1573800	That means something.
1573800	1576880	If they say grade A eggs, you don't know if you're getting a decent egg, but if their
1576880	1581560	bathroom's out of order, you are walking in human fecal matter.
1581560	1584440	I mean, the pen was out of order first off.
1584440	1585440	Yeah.
1585440	1588360	They didn't even say fuck the pens out of order.
1588360	1593960	They considered that a working pen, writing don't go in the bathroom if you know what's
1593960	1595460	good for you.
1595460	1596460	And I went in.
1596460	1597720	I took a picture of it.
1597720	1598720	It's insane.
1598720	1599720	It's gross.
1599720	1601120	It doesn't make you wretch looking at it.
1601120	1602680	And that's why I took a picture of it.
1602680	1606040	I haven't shown it to anybody that just had to take a picture.
1606040	1607040	Sorry, big rat.
1607040	1608040	I, I, I, I, I interrupted.
1608040	1609040	No, it's your show.
1609040	1610040	It's your, it's your show.
1610040	1611720	I have information about everything we're talking about.
1611720	1612720	I'm in, I'm in.
1612720	1614160	Well, actually the shiny story is boring.
1614160	1617640	I just had the best strawberry shake of my life because they actually, the woman went
1617640	1618640	back there.
1618640	1619640	I said, can I get a strawberry shake?
1619640	1623720	And I looked like a, like a vampire, you know, like I'm all in black and it's 9 30
1623720	1624720	a.m.
1624720	1625720	And you don't look like a hick either.
1625720	1626720	So probably a little freaked out.
1626720	1627720	I looked like I'm from the moon.
1627720	1631200	I walked in there and everybody's in the yellow, whatever they, whatever the colors
1631200	1636680	are for the, uh, blue and yellow and, uh, and there's all these nice old ladies working
1636680	1637680	behind the counter.
1637680	1640440	I said, can I have the strawberry shake to go, please?
1640440	1641880	And I just like, sure thing, honey.
1641880	1642880	You want it?
1642880	1643880	You want it to go?
1643880	1644880	Yeah.
1644880	1648440	And she goes back and she, I see her in the back, ice cream, fresh strawberries and milk.
1648440	1649440	And she mixed it up herself.
1649440	1650440	And she brought it to me.
1650440	1653880	I said, well, those fresh strawberries you put in there, she goes, it's a strawberry
1653880	1654880	shake.
1654880	1655880	Ain't it?
1656040	1657880	And it's like, I don't ever want to leave here.
1657880	1658880	I want to stay here forever.
1658880	1663080	And like all the women that work there, they're a grandson in the game.
1663080	1664960	It was really cool.
1664960	1668480	The first place I went to in West Virginia, we stopped at a gas station that was also
1668480	1669480	one of those sheets.
1669480	1670480	Yeah.
1670480	1678360	It was a KFC, Taco Bell, Subway, mashup, like, it's all things like, like all bad fast food
1678360	1681040	in one shitty combination.
1681040	1685160	Those bum, those, those, those get to be a bummer where it's like the Exxon mobile, but
1685160	1690520	it's like, uh, yeah, it says it's literally like a KFC sign split in half, like a, like
1690520	1694600	a sliders episode, like a bottom half of golden arches.
1694600	1700400	It's like Kentucky for McDonald's, like, you're just like, Oh, you guys know too, like, like
1700400	1701400	that there's no difference.
1701400	1705040	And it's all, I popped in there cause I needed to use the restroom and I go in there and
1705040	1710080	there's a woman behind the counter at the subway, little tiny fake half of a subway
1710080	1712360	counter at the gas station.
1712360	1717760	And she smiled and I'm saying this woman had a couple teeth, like she, she was the
1717760	1721360	lady that worked behind the counter and she smiled her, her teeth are intermittent.
1721360	1723360	If they have three, if they have three, you're lucky.
1723360	1726640	Most of the time they'll have like one or two and she smiled and went, whoa.
1726640	1728440	And she goes, welcome to West Virginia.
1728440	1733640	I'm like, Jesus Christ.
1733640	1734640	This is no joke.
1734640	1735640	She was excited.
1735640	1736640	No fucking joke.
1736640	1739800	But I, I met some, some fuckers that drink moonshine up in the hills.
1739800	1740800	Like I wanted to stay there.
1740920	1745040	Oh, my 21st birthday, my dad, my friend took me to his dad's place and he was like, Oh,
1745040	1746040	you're 21 here.
1746040	1747600	And he just gave me moonshine all night.
1747600	1748600	So good.
1748600	1749600	Just one after another.
1749600	1750600	I don't remember.
1750600	1751600	I don't remember anything.
1751600	1752600	Moonshine means what it means.
1752600	1753600	They make it in their backyard.
1753600	1756080	Well, they, they, they make it like, what do they make it?
1756080	1758040	They make it by moonlight because it was illegal.
1758040	1759040	So they make it out.
1759040	1760040	They don't make it out of moonlight.
1760040	1762320	They're not, they're not, they're not killer.
1762320	1765640	It's 40% white lightning.
1765640	1766640	What are they making it out of?
1766640	1767640	What is it?
1767640	1769040	Corn squeezings, corn squeezings, corn alcohol.
1769040	1773320	Basically, you just need sugar, sugar, corn, and they use, some guys use wood alcohol and
1773320	1774320	that makes you go blind.
1774320	1775320	Wood alcohol.
1775320	1776320	Yeah.
1776320	1777320	If you drink too much moonshine, you go blind.
1777320	1779360	How do you get alcohol out of wood?
1779360	1780840	You milk it like a cow.
1780840	1783840	You get the udders and you just squeeze.
1783840	1786200	There's no udders on wood, Big Red.
1786200	1788200	They're called branches.
1788200	1790640	All right.
1790640	1793000	So let's, let's, we gotta, we gotta.
1793000	1796200	I want to coax Big Red back into that laugh that brought him up on stage because that
1796200	1797200	was a very mirthful.
1797200	1798200	Yeah.
1798200	1799200	I know.
1799200	1800200	It's like peeing on a snowbank.
1800200	1801200	There we go.
1801200	1802200	Okay.
1802200	1803200	All right.
1803200	1804200	That's Big Red.
1804200	1805200	No, that was a dolphin.
1805200	1806200	Well, that's what it was.
1806200	1807200	Yeah.
1807200	1808200	Yeah.
1808200	1809200	Yeah.
1809200	1810200	It's beautiful.
1810200	1811200	I love it.
1811200	1812200	Well, Big Red, what are your, okay.
1812200	1813200	I still don't understand.
1813200	1815200	Are you visiting this area or are you?
1815200	1816760	No, I'm, I'm, I'm moved here.
1816760	1817760	I moved here.
1817760	1818760	So you're a new character.
1818760	1819760	Yes.
1819760	1820760	In our universe.
1820760	1821760	Yeah.
1821760	1822760	Brand new.
1822760	1823760	In every way.
1823760	1824760	So, so, and yeah.
1824760	1828320	And it's because you're going to school in someplace called aha mama.
1828320	1829320	Azusa Pacific.
1829320	1830320	Azusa Pacific.
1830320	1831320	Yeah.
1831320	1832320	I heard of it.
1832320	1833320	All right.
1833320	1834320	Never will.
1834320	1835920	I don't know.
1835920	1836920	What do they do there?
1836920	1838400	What is your, what's your ambition?
1838400	1839880	I want to be, I want to do history.
1839880	1841280	I want to write history books.
1841280	1842280	Really?
1842280	1843280	Yeah.
1843280	1844280	That's refreshing.
1844280	1845280	What, what period?
1845280	1846280	19th century US military.
1846280	1847280	What have you said?
1847280	1848280	Third?
1848280	1849280	Yeah.
1849280	1850280	Cause then you can sleep late.
1851280	1853280	I want to teach third period history.
1853280	1854280	19th century.
1854280	1855280	Yeah.
1855280	1856280	So are you like a civil war reenactor?
1856280	1857280	Do you do that?
1857280	1858280	Yeah.
1858280	1859280	I'm a civil war reenactor.
1859280	1860280	I had a feeling.
1860280	1861280	Yeah.
1861280	1862280	Really?
1862280	1863280	I, I, I'm not joking.
1863280	1866160	I really want to go do that because like I, I used to think that I used to hate the idea
1866160	1869680	of rent fairs and things like that because I thought they were so stupid and I went to
1869680	1872160	one was like, I, I'm, I'm dressing up next time.
1872160	1873280	Like this is good.
1873280	1876280	And I really want to go out and do a civil war reenactment.
1876280	1877280	Dude, you should.
1877280	1878280	They do some around here.
1878280	1879280	I know.
1879280	1885280	Are they, are they, are they, uh, sticklers bullies about inaccuracy though?
1885280	1886280	Not really.
1886280	1887280	Not the ones in California.
1887280	1891280	Cause the rent, the West Virginia, that's just for real.
1891280	1892280	West Virginia.
1892280	1893280	Obama's America.
1893280	1895280	No one, no one, no one's going to correct you on that.
1895280	1897280	You'd be fine if you showed up.
1897280	1898280	Uh, like this.
1898280	1900280	What, what, what do you add?
1900280	1902280	Wait, I don't, I thought you were saying you were fat.
1902280	1903280	I thought you were saying you were fat.
1903280	1904280	No, no, no.
1904280	1906280	I thought you were like, if I show up fat, are they going to let me reenact?
1906280	1910280	No, we went to the Renaissance fair.
1910280	1912280	There were, there were fat people in the civil war.
1912280	1913280	I'm sure.
1913280	1914280	Well, I don't know how you'd stay fat.
1914280	1916280	They ate like one piece of corn every day.
1916280	1917280	Maybe not in the actual war.
1917280	1922280	There were fat people watching the civil war going like the tea cake going like this war
1922280	1926280	is so civil that I have time to eat.
1926280	1927280	I don't know.
1927280	1928280	I don't know.
1928280	1929280	One side wins.
1929280	1930280	A slave will bring me more sandwiches.
1930280	1931280	Another side wins.
1931280	1933280	Uh, there'll be more sandwiches.
1933280	1934280	Not, not big red.
1934280	1935280	Are you a blue or a gray?
1935280	1936280	Uh, I'm gray.
1936280	1937280	You're gray.
1937280	1938280	What's your rank?
1938280	1939280	What do you do?
1939280	1940280	I'm just a shitty private.
1940280	1941280	Really?
1941280	1942280	You choose a, there's a grunt out there.
1942280	1943280	Yeah.
1943280	1944280	They don't want me commanding anybody.
1944280	1945280	Why not?
1945280	1946280	Cause of his giggle.
1946280	1947280	You can't do it.
1947280	1961900	Teach the
1961900	1962900	giggle.
1962900	1963900	Okay.
1963900	1964900	I want to know how this works.
1964900	1968740	So like, do you guys do like pickets charge or bull run or do you do like actual battles
1968740	1971260	or we just reenact what a battle would look like.
1971260	1973260	We don't have enough people to do a real battle.
1973260	1974260	Yeah, I guess so.
1974260	1975260	But there's people that do it.
1975260	1976260	Like they go out there.
1976260	1979140	We're going to do, we're going to do Gettysburg next year's the one 50th and they're going
1979140	1981860	to have 30,000 reenactors Gettysburg.
1981860	1982860	Yeah.
1982860	1983860	And how is that?
1983860	1984860	How close is that to that?
1984860	1988620	That's kind of, it's way off, but it's the most they're ever going to get way off below.
1988620	1989620	So there were way below Gettysburg.
1989620	1990620	Yeah.
1990620	1991620	I don't know.
1991620	1992620	It's the Civil War.
1992620	1996340	It's like that, that was the, we think of world war two is like, oh, we lost so many
1996340	1997340	people.
1997340	1999340	No, there was 600,000 people killed in the civil war.
1999340	2000340	Yeah.
2000340	2001340	Which is huge.
2001340	2002340	That's more than all other American conflict.
2002340	2003340	Yeah.
2003340	2006180	You can combine revolutionary to Vietnam and it doesn't equal a civil war.
2006180	2009740	Although they did cheat as a war by having Americans on both sides.
2009740	2010740	That's true.
2010740	2011740	Yeah.
2011740	2012740	Asterisk.
2012740	2015940	A lot of people don't, don't think about that.
2015940	2018100	It's the very bottom of wars.
2018100	2019100	Yeah.
2019100	2020100	Yeah.
2021100	2022100	History.
2022100	2023100	He's going to teach history.
2023100	2027420	He's going to Asahama, just came out here.
2027420	2028420	Is it just civil war?
2028420	2030740	Do you like, are you like a 1812 guy as well?
2030740	2033900	Everybody's like, uh, war sucks.
2033900	2034900	Don't tell Andrew Jackson that.
2034900	2035900	Yeah.
2035900	2037900	He probably beat the shit out of me.
2037900	2038900	Wait, was he in that war?
2038900	2039900	Yeah.
2039900	2040900	Okay.
2040900	2041900	Good.
2041900	2042900	I was just testing you.
2042900	2043900	You seem pretty gung ho about anything we throw at you, Big Red.
2043900	2048780	Is there any possibility that we could coax you into a little freestyle rap action?
2049780	2050780	Yeah.
2050780	2051780	I can try.
2051780	2052780	I mean, it's okay to do it badly.
2052780	2053780	I've lowered the bar.
2053780	2054780	Like.
2056780	2058780	Uh, uh, here we go.
2058780	2059780	Yeah.
2059780	2060780	Drop the beat.
2060780	2061780	Oh, I'm going to fuck your mom.
2061780	2062780	Take her downtown.
2062780	2065780	Put her in my pants and rub her all around.
2065780	2066780	You better look out.
2066780	2067780	I'm going to make babies.
2067780	2069780	You better duck underneath the table.
2069780	2071780	It's going to go everywhere.
2071780	2072780	You better watch out.
2072780	2073780	I'm calling the town.
2073780	2074780	Hide your women.
2074780	2075780	Hide your wives.
2075780	2076780	Hide your husbands.
2076780	2078780	Collaborate with everybody up in this house tonight.
2078780	2079780	Thank you.
2079780	2080780	Yeah.
2080780	2081780	Big Red.
2081780	2082780	Big Red.
2082780	2083780	Big Red.
2083780	2084780	Thank you.
2084780	2085780	Thank you.
2085780	2087780	Thank you, Big Red.
2087780	2089780	Thank you so much.
2089780	2090780	Yeah.
2090780	2091780	All right.
2091780	2092780	You know what?
2092780	2094780	Harmon Town just gets cooler and cooler.
2094780	2095780	Yeah.
2095780	2096780	Were you thinking what I'm thinking?
2096780	2099780	Here's why Adam Goldberg should be nervous.
2099780	2101780	Because of the new sheriff in town?
2101780	2103780	Well, because fucking Big Red tore it up.
2103780	2104780	Freestyle.
2104780	2109780	And fucking not only did we not have to say, Adam Goldberg,
2109780	2113780	ladies and gentlemen, three times, he said, thank you.
2113780	2115780	I'm Big Red and fucked off.
2115780	2116780	Amazing.
2116780	2124780	Like a show business professional.
2124780	2127780	Like a self-eating sandwich.
2127780	2129780	There's no technology to describe it.
2129780	2135780	There's no a self-coming penis.
2135780	2136780	Yeah.
2136780	2137780	He had his own edit points.
2137780	2138780	Yeah.
2138780	2142780	I'm like, why am I here?
2142780	2144780	I don't know if Adam Goldberg's here tonight,
2144780	2147780	but I picture him crushing a beer bottle.
2147780	2149780	Oh, shit.
2149780	2153780	I waited till you said it three times.
2153780	2154780	You Beetlejuice me.
2154780	2156780	Dan, this love.
2156780	2158780	Ladies and gentlemen.
2158780	2161780	Adam Goldberg.
2161780	2162780	What do you think, Adam Goldberg?
2162780	2163780	What do you think of Big Red?
2163780	2169780	Has gold fallen to green so quickly, Dan?
2169780	2170780	No, it's gone to red.
2170780	2172780	Yes.
2172780	2173780	Thank you.
2173780	2176780	The first time I was up here, I read your brother's emails
2176780	2177780	three times.
2177780	2178780	We had some fun with it.
2178780	2180780	I said a funny quip and we ended the show.
2180780	2181780	That was amazing.
2181780	2184780	And you won't have me turn on other audience members.
2184780	2186780	I know that that might have been not what you intended,
2186780	2191780	but it certainly was crushing a beer bottle in the back row.
2191780	2194780	And here's what it is.
2194780	2196780	I'm always swinging at that baseball.
2196780	2197780	You know what happens?
2197780	2200780	The best players, if you hit 400, you're one of the best players
2200780	2201780	to ever hit baseball.
2201780	2203780	That's only four and 10.
2203780	2204780	Yeah.
2204780	2205780	I think I'm 4.5 and 10.
2205780	2206780	All right?
2206780	2208780	That's why the one-time guest will always be better than me.
2208780	2210780	Why Fedor will always be better than me.
2210780	2213780	Sorry, didn't mean to say your name.
2213780	2215780	Nobody knows what you're talking about, Adam.
2215780	2216780	I'm not jealous.
2216780	2217780	I'm not jealous.
2217780	2219780	You're taking Spencer on tour.
2219780	2220780	There you go.
2220780	2221780	I'm not jealous.
2221780	2223780	I'm not jealous.
2223780	2224780	I'm not.
2224780	2225780	I'm not.
2225780	2226780	Make a little.
2226780	2227780	I'm not.
2227780	2229780	Look at this mic stand.
2229780	2232780	People on the podcast would realize that the mic stand is like
2232780	2235780	one and a half Adams tall at this point.
2235780	2236780	All right.
2236780	2240780	I'm not jealous that there are always exciting people in the audience
2240780	2242780	in the dose of two and a half minutes.
2242780	2246780	But every week I give you a consistently bad seven and a half
2246780	2253780	minutes and quality quality is eclipsed by quantity every single time.
2253780	2254780	Adam.
2254780	2257780	Describe your apartment.
2257780	2258780	In rap.
2258780	2260780	Or is this this is more of a.
2260780	2263780	What do we see when we walk in the front door of my apartment?
2263780	2266780	Walls bank at my apartment.
2266780	2271780	There seem to be a few things but not much and the oh
2271780	2279780	oh if I don't sing certain lines it's going to be overtaken by that guy.
2279780	2280780	No don't worry about it.
2280780	2284780	I want to know that's it's I want to hear a description of your apartment.
2284780	2286780	Or it's white walls.
2286780	2288780	Walk us through the front door.
2288780	2289780	OK.
2289780	2290780	Welcome.
2290780	2291780	There's a welcome mat that says welcome.
2291780	2297780	I think I'm pretty sure I got on six unit building eight third floor.
2297780	2301780	Beautiful view of a kind of victory in Hollywood.
2301780	2302780	Security code to get in.
2302780	2303780	Yeah.
2303780	2304780	No.
2304780	2307780	It's a gate that doesn't that certain family keeps breaking so their kids can
2307780	2308780	get in and out.
2308780	2311780	And at this point I'm done calling the landlord about it.
2311780	2313780	It's just easier.
2313780	2315780	It's it's security through obscurity.
2315780	2319780	No one's going to come up to that specific apartment and be like oh well.
2319780	2320780	Two levels.
2320780	2321780	Three.
2321780	2323780	I'm not bragging about it.
2323780	2324780	No.
2324780	2325780	No.
2325780	2326780	No.
2326780	2327780	You can call.
2327780	2328780	You can come over.
2328780	2329780	We invited you in.
2329780	2330780	Three levels.
2330780	2331780	How does that work.
2331780	2334780	Well there's a badly designed there.
2334780	2336780	There's one that goes like Tetris.
2336780	2340780	There's a person who's so sunken.
2340780	2341780	Yeah.
2341780	2343780	They have a window into the other guy's living room.
2343780	2347780	If they put another apartment in mind disappears and it goes down to the next
2347780	2348780	line.
2348780	2353780	So when we walk into your apartment and be honest and I will I will I will lower
2353780	2358780	or raise it as it were of honesty and say there was when I lived in Hollywood my
2358780	2362780	one bedroom apartment when I would walk into and you might be a neat freak but
2362780	2369780	right after this is 1999 heat vision and Jack has been not picked up by Fox for
2369780	2370780	whom I am currently working.
2370780	2372780	God bless them for their decisions.
2372780	2377780	I we're getting some we were getting somewhere.
2377780	2380780	This is more than he talks to me ever Jeff.
2380780	2382780	You guys don't fight.
2382780	2387780	When you walked into my apartment you would see like like you would be knee high in
2387780	2388780	pizza boxes.
2388780	2392780	There was mannequin legs with pantyhose on them.
2392780	2394780	There was Mountain Dew to be had.
2394780	2399780	I was I was wiping my ass with t-shirts because I wouldn't go buy toilet paper
2399780	2403780	because I didn't want people at Albertsons to know that heat vision and Jack hadn't
2403780	2405780	been picked up for series.
2405780	2408780	Can they tell that just by what toilet paper you buy.
2408780	2413780	Like oh he's down to bounty heat vision and Jack did not get picked up.
2413780	2414780	I'm loving this.
2414780	2416780	That's an awesome laugh.
2416780	2417780	He's laughing.
2417780	2420780	God we miss you big red.
2420780	2424780	He's buying store the Hollywood reporters they're trying to see who buys store
2424780	2425780	brand.
2425780	2429780	So are you I mean when I because I wouldn't be surprised by anything if I
2429780	2430780	walked into your apartment.
2430780	2435780	What do I see hoarders or do I see like like hoarders they can afford to have
2435780	2436780	things.
2436780	2438780	They're like oh when's Adam going to move in.
2438780	2442780	This is a nice space which is a bad thing to say after 15 months.
2442780	2445780	But I was like oh there's some posters that printer needs doing.
2445780	2449780	It's more to the point where everything that's going to be in there has been
2449780	2454780	there and it's slowly turning yellow like Miss Haversham stress.
2454780	2456780	It's like a wedding cake for a party.
2456780	2457780	No one attended.
2457780	2458780	It's my life.
2458780	2459780	What.
2459780	2460780	Yeah.
2460780	2461780	Great expectations of that reference.
2461780	2463780	What's you mean the wallpaper or the walls.
2463780	2464780	The walls are.
2464780	2467780	It's not a bad place to be.
2467780	2472780	It's just that there hasn't been any attempts to be able to put more things
2472780	2473780	in there.
2473780	2474780	Is it dirty.
2474780	2475780	Is it.
2475780	2478780	It's it's clean as it has everything in there cleanish.
2478780	2480780	That's like saying a little bit pregnant.
2480780	2484780	It doesn't add any information but my apartment is cleanish and a little bit
2484780	2488780	pregnant with the hopes that I might be able to buy furniture that was not left
2488780	2489780	on the road somewhere.
2489780	2494780	But of all the pieces that I've seen I picked the cleanliest ones mostly.
2494780	2495780	How many bedrooms.
2495780	2497780	One for me and one for the roommate.
2497780	2498780	Oh.
2498780	2499780	Who's the roommate.
2499780	2502780	She's a beautiful chef named Anastasia Davis.
2502780	2503780	Has she come here.
2503780	2504780	I know she works.
2504780	2506780	She's a chef at USC.
2506780	2507780	Her name is Anastasia Davis.
2507780	2508780	Yes.
2508780	2509780	Wow.
2509780	2510780	Is it Jeff in drag and.
2510780	2513780	It's just like.
2513780	2516780	Let's just.
2517780	2520780	That explains all the suits actually.
2520780	2521780	And she is really tall.
2521780	2523780	It's more that.
2523780	2527780	If I were to bring her here she'd be like I don't think he gets to use that word.
2527780	2530780	I think he thinks he can use that word but he can't use that word.
2530780	2531780	The N word.
2531780	2532780	Yeah.
2532780	2533780	Oh.
2533780	2534780	She's a bluff.
2534780	2540780	An African-American chef.
2540780	2542780	The second F is for female.
2542780	2544780	That's why you've never brought her by.
2544780	2545780	Because you're racist.
2546780	2548780	Because I'm racist.
2548780	2551780	That is one untrue and two irrelevant.
2551780	2554780	And three I'm not arguing on the first point.
2554780	2556780	That's establishing that.
2556780	2558780	Bring Anastasia by for Christmas.
2558780	2559780	All right.
2559780	2560780	Sounds good.
2560780	2563780	We only have a couple more episodes to record before we leave.
2563780	2567780	And like you're living a double life with this woman.
2567780	2569780	By not bringing her to a podcast.
2569780	2570780	Yeah show her.
2570780	2571780	Show her who you are.
2571780	2572780	I make her listen to it.
2572780	2573780	I put it on like.
2573780	2574780	Have you listened to Harmontown yet?
2574780	2577780	I got some really good rejoinders in there.
2577780	2579780	And then you talk shit for 15 minutes.
2579780	2580780	But it's fine.
2580780	2582780	We're buddies.
2582780	2583780	All right.
2583780	2587780	Well any parting thoughts on the election?
2587780	2588780	I'm kidding.
2588780	2589780	I know.
2589780	2590780	I know.
2590780	2592780	I'm going to self deport off this stage.
2592780	2593780	All right.
2593780	2595780	Well you remember how Big Red did it?
2595780	2598780	No.
2598780	2600780	No.
2600780	2603780	Don't fucking Woody Woodpecker him man.
2604780	2605780	Jeff.
2605780	2606780	What?
2606780	2608780	Did you know Pinocchio actually collected a lot of birds?
2608780	2609780	No.
2609780	2610780	I didn't know that.
2610780	2611780	He even had a woodpecker.
2611780	2612780	That's Adam Goldberg.
2612780	2613780	Adam Goldberg everyone.
2613780	2614780	He had a woodpecker.
2614780	2615780	All right.
2615780	2616780	Adam Goldberg came up.
2616780	2622780	He's still on stage.
2622780	2623780	He's still actually.
2623780	2624780	Okay.
2624780	2625780	There he goes.
2625780	2626780	There he goes.
2626780	2629780	The audience and I and Jeff and everyone.
2629780	2632780	Like we continue to walk the line with Adam Goldberg.
2632780	2633780	I don't know.
2633780	2634780	What is that line do you think?
2634780	2637780	I hear a beleaguered sigh from that direction.
2637780	2639780	Well I mean like.
2639780	2641780	We created a monster.
2641780	2643780	Do you love him or do you hate him?
2643780	2645780	Are you rooting for him?
2645780	2646780	Are we bullies?
2646780	2647780	It certainly doesn't go to hate.
2647780	2649780	It certainly also doesn't go to love.
2649780	2651780	Definitely doesn't go to love.
2651780	2652780	I don't know.
2652780	2653780	What is it Adam?
2653780	2655780	Big Red I think I'm ready to love.
2655780	2656780	Yeah.
2656780	2657780	No.
2657780	2658780	Yeah.
2658780	2659780	I may stand up at my wedding.
2659780	2660780	Yeah.
2660780	2663780	But then maybe in four episodes Big Red's up here and like Jesus Christ.
2663780	2664780	We might find out.
2664780	2666780	But things rarely take a turn like that.
2666780	2668780	Big Red don't hurt us.
2668780	2669780	Okay good.
2669780	2670780	Thank you.
2670780	2671780	Oh we love you too Big Red.
2671780	2674780	He just seems cuddly and he embraces it.
2674780	2676780	It seems like what you see is what you get with Big Red.
2676780	2677780	Yeah.
2677780	2678780	Big Laffer.
2678780	2679780	Big Smiler.
2679780	2685780	Big fusive answers and Adam comes up and people hold their breath.
2685780	2686780	Yeah.
2686780	2688780	He's like a tightrope walker.
2688780	2690780	And then they're like no one.
2690780	2693780	Not only do you not know if you're on his side or against him.
2693780	2695780	Then we start to divide from each other.
2695780	2696780	Right.
2696780	2699780	Because you guys start going Dan stop stop bringing Adam Goldberg up.
2699780	2701780	Stop saying his name.
2701780	2703780	And then I'm like fuck you guys.
2703780	2705780	I'm Adam Goldberg.
2705780	2707780	I you are too.
2707780	2709780	This is Harmon town.
2709780	2710780	We are Adam Goldberg.
2710780	2714780	There should be a statue of him outside our city in some ways.
2714780	2715780	As a warning.
2715780	2723780	Let's bring Spencer up right now Dan.
2723780	2724780	Yeah.
2724780	2725780	Spencer.
2725780	2726780	Spencer.
2726780	2727780	Don't use the dragons time.
2727780	2733780	Take your Jensen dragons.
2733780	2736780	But also I was going to bring the guy that's going to shoot.
2736780	2737780	Oh shit.
2737780	2739780	But Spencer can get set up.
2739780	2740780	But I do want to check in.
2740780	2742780	I think it's important.
2742780	2743780	We're taping tonight.
2743780	2744780	You might have noticed a video camera.
2744780	2747780	They're being very inconspicuous and everything's fine.
2747780	2749780	It's no big deal.
2749780	2751780	We have made this decision.
2751780	2753780	The tour dates are not final.
2753780	2755780	But they're like I mean this is a real thing.
2755780	2757780	We're definitely starting January 10th.
2757780	2761780	We're proceeding across the nation around the perimeter.
2761780	2766780	And we're doing like a three week tour of the nation.
2766780	2771780	Obviously we're not going to go everywhere in the nation in three weeks.
2771780	2777780	Because as I've said Harmontown is a it's a it's a catastrophic chaotic like weird thing.
2777780	2782780	And every time I try to make something happen it turns to mud in my hands.
2782780	2786780	And every time we kind of like go with the flow we tend to have a lot of fun.
2786780	2788780	Now that might be an L.A. thing.
2788780	2793780	Maybe a hipster thing and like I'm Spalding Gray and I wrote Monster House.
2793780	2795780	And so people want to come and listen to me talk.
2795780	2798780	And we've boiled down to 50 of you who seem to come every week.
2799780	2803780	And maybe maybe that's you know I'm well aware of that possibility.
2803780	2806780	We're going to we're going to proceed to Tempe.
2806780	2815780	And we're going to have a cold bucket of reality splashed over us there at our first show there at Felt's Mound comics and Tempe.
2815780	2822780	And you know people are going to be going whoa I thought I thought I don't know what a Tempe accent sounds like.
2822780	2823780	That's pretty good.
2823780	2827780	I thought you were going to talk about Danny Pooty.
2827780	2829780	I don't know what they would have thought.
2829780	2831780	I thought you're going to have a stand up act.
2831780	2832780	You don't.
2832780	2835780	You're a terrible rapper and you're dumb and you're fat and you stink.
2835780	2836780	Your butt stinks.
2836780	2843780	The danger is that people are the people that are going to come see us as we go on tour are people that have heard the slightly edited version of our podcast.
2843780	2844780	Right.
2844780	2845780	So they're going to hold us to a higher standard.
2845780	2846780	Yep.
2846780	2847780	You people get the real.
2847780	2848780	I thought you guys were more compressed.
2848780	2850780	I thought it was about an hour 18.
2852780	2856780	Why is it two hours and filled with you saying edit this out.
2858780	2860780	It's just I don't like it.
2860780	2861780	I'm from Tempe.
2862780	2864780	I'm a Tempe stereotype.
2866780	2867780	I'm Marvin Tempe.
2868780	2877780	I go out my front yard and I rake it because it's gravel and I go to the old cactus mines.
2879780	2882780	I dig up the dig up stones and cacti.
2882780	2884780	Next day they're in Austin Texas.
2885780	2886780	Whoa.
2887780	2888780	Roused in Dale's Hills.
2889780	2901780	I can't wait to see Dan Harmon before I go and have a calamari on the Gulf of Mexico.
2902780	2902780	
2902780	2904780	Are you related to Marvin Tempe by any chance?
2904780	2907780	Well he's my second brother on the third side.
2909780	2910780	Two weeks later.
2910780	2912780	Boston Massachusetts.
2912780	2914780	Oh ho ho ho.
2916780	2918780	The Dan Harmon show.
2919780	2921780	It's a wicked retarded no.
2922780	2924780	I did not understand.
2924780	2926780	It's not as good as the departed.
2929780	2931780	I am from New Orleans.
2932780	2936780	Came up to Boston for Dan Harmon's show.
2936780	2939780	You should not be using me for your exit poll.
2940780	2941780	I am not represented.
2941780	2942780	I will skew the day.
2942780	2944780	I will skew the day down.
2947780	2948780	Albany New York.
2952780	2953780	I just.
2954780	2960780	I have a cold and he said that and I was drinking and I inflated a snap bubble out of my nose.
2961780	2962780	Which hasn't happened since sixth grade.
2963780	2964780	It has happened.
2964780	2965780	I'm not that cool.
2965780	2966780	Albany.
2966780	2967780	Oh ho.
2969780	2972780	Muffy let's go to the Dan Harmon show.
2977780	2978780	Swallow a bug.
2980780	2983780	I didn't understand what he was doing tonight.
2984780	2987780	I thought he created community as I would have more.
2988780	2990780	Jack Nicholson Minnesota.
2997780	3001780	Well seems the Dan Harmon act was.
3002780	3012780	Curious given his misunderstandings the misdirected assumptions that people in the city would talk like Jack Nicholson.
3014780	3019780	He ought to take that act on the road to to Connery Alabama.
3021780	3023780	Can we edit the whole thing out.
3023780	3025780	No that fucking stays.
3026780	3027780	All right.
3027780	3028780	Make it worse.
3028780	3029780	Spencer get us up to speed.
3029780	3032780	Last time on the chronicles of Sharpie and Quark.
3033780	3038780	Our heroes had lost Lord Butzillock hearing rumors of his flight in the night.
3038780	3039780	What a fright.
3039780	3043780	Sharpie openly lamented the lack of his party's tracking ability.
3043780	3047780	Just then they realized an expert tracker had been following them all along.
3047780	3054780	Conveniently the canine mole rain was standing nearby and united the party struck out in search of Sharpie's father.
3054780	3064780	They immediately lost the trail and in a dark moment of desperation Sharpie managed to tap into forbidden blood magic casting a spell in the hopes of divining the location of his father.
3065780	3071780	Compulsively following the evil spells pull our heroes came upon what appeared to be a gnoll encampment.
3071780	3074780	They hid in the bushes deciding how to proceed.
3075780	3077780	Unpause.
3077780	3084780	So we've come upon a gnoll camp and now I have to look there's no actors playing my father.
3084780	3085780	Yeah yeah we were gonna have an act.
3085780	3086780	Don't worry about it.
3086780	3088780	I got this cover you guys.
3088780	3091780	These are the fruits of my of my desperate efforts to plan things.
3091780	3092780	All right.
3092780	3096780	So we are we're here at a camp a gnoll camp.
3097780	3099780	Well thanks for our thank you.
3099780	3101780	Are these good gnolls or bad gnolls Spencer?
3102780	3103780	Do we know?
3103780	3104780	Do we know?
3104780	3105780	You do not know.
3106780	3109780	Well we helped kill some bad gnolls correct?
3109780	3111780	You did kill some gnolls yes.
3111780	3117780	Yes and so are these the black skull camp gnolls or the white bones gnolls?
3117780	3121780	You were outside an encampment of gnolls of undetermined tribe.
3123780	3125780	You're a good distance off.
3125780	3132780	You can see several dwellings made of interlocking bones of massive proportions perhaps from the skeletons of dragons or perhaps a titanic frog.
3133780	3140780	From the center of the circular park of huts rises smoke and you can smell the scent of burning meat from even here.
3141780	3143780	Oh Sharpie I'm hungry.
3143780	3145780	The meat I care not for danger.
3145780	3150780	Let's drive headlong towards the smell of burning frog.
3151780	3154780	I mean this is a whole camp and and you know I'm so drunk.
3154780	3157780	We killed a bunch we killed a bunch of bad gnolls.
3157780	3158780	These gotta be good gnolls.
3158780	3159780	Let's just go on now.
3159780	3160780	Because their insignia is different?
3160780	3161780	I don't know.
3162780	3165780	How close can we get without being seen Spencer?
3165780	3168780	I'd say you're about as close as you could get without being seen.
3168780	3171780	Okay I examine their compound.
3171780	3172780	What do I see?
3172780	3177780	You see several bone huts stretched together by animal hides.
3177780	3181780	You don't manage to see any people but you do see smoke rising from the encampment.
3181780	3183780	I have the power to talk to small animals do I not?
3183780	3184780	Correct.
3184780	3186780	I summon a squirrel.
3186780	3187780	Whoa!
3189780	3190780	Jesus.
3191780	3194780	That was a quantum leap forward in your D&D confidence.
3194780	3197780	I talked to Spencer earlier about my.
3197780	3199780	It was six weeks prior.
3199780	3201780	I don't know what the fuck's going on.
3201780	3204780	I summon a squirrel.
3204780	3209780	We were at the pike earlier and Spencer told me that gnomes have the ability to talk to animals.
3209780	3210780	Alright.
3210780	3212780	I'm gonna send a fucking squirrel.
3212780	3213780	Okay.
3213780	3216780	Are there any squirrels or small rodents about that I can I can convene with?
3217780	3219780	Casting speak with animals on yourself.
3219780	3222780	You managed to call over a small squirrel.
3222780	3224780	Hey squirrel.
3225780	3226780	Listen man.
3226780	3228780	You don't know me from Adam.
3228780	3229780	Do me a solid.
3229780	3234780	Go and sneak in that camp and tell me what the name of their gnoll tribe is.
3236780	3237780	It's like what name?
3237780	3238780	What name?
3238780	3239780	Like of the tribe?
3239780	3240780	Find out.
3240780	3241780	Are they the gnolls?
3241780	3243780	The evil gnolls that we killed?
3243780	3247780	Are they the good gnoll tribe that might be on our side?
3247780	3249780	Do you have any nuts?
3249780	3250780	Do I?
3250780	3251780	The insignia.
3251780	3255780	There's a white skull insignia and then there's a black paw or something like that.
3255780	3257780	Like tell the squirrel to look for.
3257780	3260780	Look for the insignia of the gnoll tribe.
3260780	3262780	Listen squirrel.
3262780	3264780	Here's two nuts on the front end.
3264780	3266780	There'll be six more when you come back.
3266780	3267780	Duke them.
3267780	3268780	Duke them.
3269780	3270780	Oh.
3270780	3271780	They'll be nuts.
3272780	3275780	You're going to be up to your tits and nuts.
3275780	3276780	Ecstatic.
3276780	3280780	The squirrel rushes off into the village.
3280780	3281780	All right.
3281780	3283780	Well we got some time when we hear about this recon.
3283780	3286780	You hear rustling in the brush behind you.
3286780	3289780	Before you can react you hear a low grating snarl.
3289780	3291780	Move and you're dead.
3292780	3293780	Just kidding.
3293780	3295780	But keep your voices and weapons down.
3296780	3298780	That's a lot to react to.
3299780	3301780	Passive aggressive burglar?
3302780	3307780	We've been ambushed by a verbal roller coaster.
3311780	3314780	I put one hand up and the other hand down.
3315780	3316780	You do that.
3317780	3319780	I slowly turn.
3319780	3321780	You slowly turn.
3321780	3325780	Before you you see a yellow knoll with matted fur coated in grime.
3325780	3327780	Bits of grass and dried blood.
3327780	3330780	He wears brown leather armor and carries a wavy bladed dagger.
3330780	3334780	He smells awful and wears a necklace made of bones, ears and fingers.
3334780	3339780	I mean you know harm he says brandishing a dagger dangerously close to your face.
3340780	3342780	Wait this guy's complicated.
3344780	3345780	Meet us a little less harm.
3345780	3346780	He does bits.
3346780	3347780	Yeah.
3348780	3349780	What's his insignia?
3349780	3351780	I just want to make sure I get the crips and the bloods.
3351780	3354780	He has a small black paw print on his chest.
3354780	3355780	Those are the good guys.
3355780	3356780	Those are the good guys.
3356780	3357780	Yeah.
3357780	3358780	Why did I talk to that squirrel?
3358780	3360780	I might have sent him to a certain death.
3360780	3362780	Don't worry about him.
3364780	3367780	What are you guys doing outside this encampment?
3367780	3371780	I don't want to jinx myself but why don't you mean us any harm?
3372780	3374780	Because I've been following you.
3374780	3378780	I thought you might be able to you know track Lord Butz a lot and I'd be able to reunite with him.
3379780	3385780	You see my name is Yurch and as of the Butz alignment with the black paw knolls
3385780	3390780	I was sent over to keep an eye on Lord Butz a lot but he managed to elude my grasp in the night.
3391780	3392780	In a fright.
3394780	3397780	So you've been our protector but you lost track of us?
3397780	3403780	I've been watching you you know take this several day trip and I've been hoping you'd find your father.
3403780	3405780	You could have thrown a helping hand a couple times.
3405780	3407780	We almost got our asses kicked back there.
3408780	3410780	You seemed fine.
3410780	3414780	All right Yurch.
3419780	3422780	Is my dad in this camp? Are we in danger?
3422780	3424780	I don't know. Your guess is as good as mine.
3424780	3426780	I thought you knew where you were going.
3426780	3428780	You're a black paw right?
3428780	3435780	That's definitely true but they left us out of some of these negotiations and when he left with those warriors in the night we had no clue where he was going.
3435780	3445780	I take my sword out and put it towards the back of our new friend or possibly foe and I say well let's walk you in first and let's find out if this is a friendly camp or not.
3445780	3446780	Jesus?
3446780	3447780	Yeah no.
3448780	3453780	I'm just saying you know this guy had a knife dangerously close to your face saying he was your friend.
3453780	3458780	I have a knife dangerously close to his spinal cord saying walk us in there and say how do you do?
3459780	3465780	He mulls over your offer and he says that seems like a good plan.
3467780	3470780	I could tell you right now that this is a white skull camp.
3470780	3472780	You can see by all those bones they used to make you hunt.
3472780	3473780	Wait bad guys.
3473780	3475780	Yeah those are our enemies.
3475780	3478780	Okay okay let's stop let's stop.
3478780	3479780	Where's my dad?
3479780	3480780	Where's the squirrel?
3484780	3486780	The squirrel returns.
3487780	3488780	The squirrel returns.
3488780	3489780	Jesus.
3489780	3492780	All right everybody fucking calm down.
3492780	3494780	Squirrel what did you see?
3494780	3496780	I saw a bunch of white skulls.
3496780	3497780	Yeah we found that out of there.
3497780	3500780	All right you useless fucking dick.
3500780	3501780	There's more.
3501780	3502780	That was just the first sentence.
3502780	3504780	Oh sorry squirrel.
3504780	3506780	Here's a here's a nut continue.
3506780	3511780	It appears that the village is on fire and several slain gnolls lie in the streets.
3512780	3514780	There's a there's a battle afoot.
3515780	3519780	Well any enemy of our enemy is our friend correct?
3519780	3524780	A squirrel of our white pod gnoll is a black pod gnoll.
3524780	3525780	Let's go.
3525780	3526780	Yes.
3527780	3529780	You know what the squirrel say Dan.
3529780	3537780	While you're watching the squirrel the gnoll the yurch who was previously under your blade manages to squirrel himself away and rushes towards the village.
3537780	3541780	He says don't waste any time and mind those traps.
3542780	3544780	Any dashes away towards the village.
3544780	3546780	Right behind you yurch.
3546780	3548780	Traps minded.
3550780	3553780	Do I need to cast any light to make sure I don't step in a trap or something?
3553780	3559780	You don't have any oh I guess you probably could cast some light but I mean you guys aren't too well versed in traps to be honest.
3559780	3562780	I bet I have a spell for detecting traps hold on.
3562780	3563780	Oh man.
3563780	3565780	I could send a bunch of squirrels.
3565780	3571780	I summon I summon a murder of squirrels.
3573780	3575780	Two and a half squirrels show up.
3577780	3578780	That's metric.
3578780	3581780	I have a squirrel.
3582780	3586780	You see I keep forgetting that I always kill a squirrel when I do that.
3587780	3593780	I send squirrels forward in an advance guard to detect any traps.
3593780	3595780	You send the squirrels forward.
3596780	3599780	They run into a small wire that you hadn't previously seen.
3599780	3603780	A large bag flies and hits the squirrel in the face.
3603780	3605780	He's covered in a white powder.
3605780	3607780	He stumbles blindly into a bush.
3609780	3610780	So we're good to go.
3613780	3616780	I feel like we should make sure he's okay.
3617780	3620780	He's basically like a hero.
3621780	3627780	Until we know he's dead we should probably check in with him.
3627780	3630780	Yeah I examine the squirrels condition.
3630780	3634780	It appears to be covered in a white powdery substance of unknown origin.
3634780	3635780	I snort the powder.
3638780	3639780	It was just flour.
3639780	3640780	What?
3640780	3642780	He got hit by a sack of flour.
3642780	3643780	He's dazed.
3643780	3645780	But we tripped what is we tripped the trap.
3645780	3646780	We're good to go.
3646780	3649780	Well who leaves the trap with a sack of flour.
3649780	3650780	Yeah they're heavy.
3650780	3651780	They can kill a squirrel.
3651780	3652780	Or at least daze them.
3652780	3654780	They didn't even kill a squirrel.
3654780	3655780	Huh?
3657780	3658780	All right.
3658780	3659780	Use your magic.
3659780	3661780	Can't you just send a hawk over there or something?
3661780	3662780	We follow Yurich.
3663780	3665780	You follow Yurich towards the village.
3665780	3666780	We follow Robert Yurich.
3669780	3672780	As you're running towards the village you feel the ground under you give way.
3672780	3673780	Ah shit.
3673780	3674780	You fall in a pit!
3674780	3675780	No!
3676780	3677780	No!
3679780	3682780	You fall about 30 feet into a deep dank dark pit.
3683780	3687780	You both take four falling damage.
3687780	3688780	That's none.
3689780	3691780	I have the power to heal light wounds don't I?
3691780	3692780	I don't think so.
3693780	3694780	Don't I?
3694780	3696780	Pretty sure I do.
3698780	3702780	I have a spell that says negate normal pits.
3706780	3708780	A circle of protection pits.
3709780	3710780	That wasn't fine.
3710780	3711780	Don't mind me.
3711780	3712780	What about pits?
3712780	3714780	Is it too late to use uncanny dodge?
3714780	3715780	Whatever the fuck that is.
3715780	3718780	Unfortunately uncanny dodge does not affect pits.
3719780	3720780	It's more of a gravity thing.
3720780	3723780	It's actually just an alternative rock band from the 90s.
3726780	3727780	They were great.
3728780	3730780	And by 90s you mean the 90s.
3730780	3732780	Like this is like 0090.
3732780	3733780	Right.
3733780	3734780	Because it's D&D time.
3734780	3737780	In the darkness you can barely make out your friends.
3737780	3738780	Motherfucker.
3738780	3742780	As your eyes adjust you can see a lightly colored ring on the floor on the opposite
3742780	3743780	sides of the pit.
3744780	3745780	It looks like rope.
3746780	3748780	Next to you is a skeleton.
3748780	3750780	It appears to have a small patch.
3750780	3752780	Pouch wedged in its ribcage.
3753780	3755780	The skeleton has a pouch wedged in his ribcage?
3755780	3759780	Someone has wedged a pouch into the skeleton's ribcage.
3759780	3761780	But it's just your copper pot.
3763780	3764780	20 percent.
3765780	3766780	Not me.
3767780	3768780	Goonies.
3768780	3769780	Goonies.
3769780	3770780	Oh shit yeah.
3773780	3774780	Okay.
3774780	3775780	So there's a ring that looks like rope.
3776780	3777780	That's what I heard too.
3777780	3778780	You're in the darkness.
3778780	3779780	So that sounds like a trap right?
3779780	3780780	Yeah.
3780780	3781780	That sounds like a great way.
3781780	3782780	Because the skeleton guy tells no tales.
3782780	3783780	Are there any squirrels in this pit?
3783780	3785780	There are no squirrels in this pit.
3785780	3786780	Damn it.
3786780	3787780	He's got a pouch.
3787780	3788780	Let's check out the pouch.
3789780	3790780	You grab the pouch.
3790780	3791780	Well I look at the pouch.
3791780	3792780	You look at the pouch.
3794780	3795780	It's dark.
3795780	3797780	It appears to be brown.
3798780	3799780	Is it a turd?
3799780	3801780	You don't know that it's not.
3802780	3803780	Can I smell it?
3803780	3805780	It doesn't smell like a turd.
3805780	3807780	It could be old though.
3807780	3810780	Hey Sharpie, stop smelling the pouch and pick it up.
3811780	3813780	I pluck the pouch from the skeleton's ribcage.
3813780	3816780	It appears to be full of some sort of dust or powder.
3816780	3818780	What does it look like?
3818780	3819780	I snort the powder.
3819780	3820780	It looks like a powder.
3821780	3823780	You snort the powder?
3823780	3824780	Yes.
3825780	3827780	I can't take you anywhere.
3828780	3829780	You take one damage.
3829780	3832780	You feel your insides being wrung out a little bit.
3832780	3833780	Don't snort that.
3833780	3834780	It's not good.
3835780	3837780	Who was going to snort it?
3837780	3841780	No one in this realm snorts things by default.
3841780	3842780	I'm a barbarian.
3844780	3846780	You feel very thirsty.
3849780	3850780	You got any water?
3851780	3852780	You do.
3853780	3854780	Give him some water.
3855780	3857780	He appreciates the beverage.
3858780	3860780	Macaulay, Culkin, and Monster now.
3861780	3863780	You said there was a ring that looked like a rope?
3864780	3865780	Yeah, it's really dark.
3865780	3866780	You guys can barely see.
3866780	3868780	There's a light-colored ring on the floor.
3868780	3870780	Well, I probably have some kind of light spell, don't I?
3870780	3871780	Probably, yeah.
3871780	3872780	I think you have light.
3872780	3874780	You might have a torch in your inventory.
3874780	3876780	I want to do something fancy.
3876780	3877780	Do something fancy.
3877780	3878780	What's my magic?
3879780	3880780	You have burning hands.
3880780	3881780	It's pretty flashy.
3881780	3882780	No, no.
3884780	3885780	Yeah, he does have dancing lights.
3885780	3887780	Okay, I cast dancing lights.
3887780	3891780	You make several dancing lights hover and float in the air.
3891780	3893780	You see, it is very clearly a rope,
3893780	3896780	but there seems to be a shimmering border
3896780	3898780	in a cubical fashion around it.
3901780	3902780	I just don't get it.
3902780	3904780	Big red, any thoughts?
3904780	3905780	It's like a...
3905780	3907780	Obviously, there's a skeleton down here.
3908780	3910780	He tried to do something with that rope, too.
3910780	3911780	He did the obvious thing.
3911780	3912780	He grabbed the rope.
3912780	3914780	Now he's a skeleton as a result.
3914780	3916780	Why he has a pouch in his rib cage?
3916780	3917780	Do we need that pouch?
3917780	3918780	We need that pouch, right?
3918780	3919780	I don't know.
3919780	3920780	You need it.
3920780	3921780	Probably.
3921780	3922780	Yeah, it's terrible.
3927780	3928780	Anybody?
3928780	3930780	Well, yeah, but it might have poisoned him at a time.
3930780	3931780	Anybody?
3933780	3936780	Throw the powder around it to see if the...
3938780	3940780	This guy thinks the cube is a force field around the rope.
3940780	3942780	All right, we got a guy in the front row that thinks
3942780	3944780	the cube is a force field around the rope.
3944780	3945780	Force field around the rope?
3945780	3947780	What is the powder going to do that?
3948780	3951780	I take the pouch and I sprinkle the powder on the cubicle,
3951780	3952780	or the cube around the thing.
3952780	3955780	It gives a violent shudder and a terrible shriek.
3955780	3957780	It appears to be a gelatinous cube,
3957780	3960780	an ooze formed into a cube,
3960780	3963780	with the sole purpose of engulfing anyone that falls near it.
3964780	3965780	It lurches forward.
3966780	3970780	It's in the way that you use it.
3974780	3977780	Well, it's been a long time since I've said it,
3977780	3979780	but ray of frost.
3982780	3984780	I thought that was cooler than it was.
3985780	3989780	It was exactly as cool as they responded.
3990780	3992780	It lunges towards you, but you step aside
3992780	3997780	and cast a quick ray of frost into its left cubicle side.
3998780	4001780	We're being attacked by a big jello right now, aren't we?
4002780	4003780	Yeah, you are.
4003780	4005780	Well, don't turn around and talk to us.
4005780	4006780	We should bone out.
4006780	4007780	Yeah, we should bone out.
4008780	4012780	The frost hits it in the side and does two damage to the cube.
4012780	4013780	Whatever.
4013780	4014780	It doesn't seem very bother.
4014780	4016780	I will be more powerful at higher levels.
4019780	4020780	Flaming sword.
4021780	4023780	Pulling your flaming sword from its sheath.
4023780	4025780	You strike at the cube.
4026780	4028780	You strike the cube.
4029780	4031780	A flaming gash appears in its hide
4031780	4034780	and it quickly seals itself over with its oozing bulk.
4035780	4036780	It takes some damage.
4036780	4037780	Hold on.
4038780	4041780	It takes five damage.
4042780	4047780	I have a potion of enlarged person,
4048780	4049780	and it's not what you think.
4051780	4052780	Or is it?
4052780	4055780	This was not given to me through email.
4057780	4062780	I toss it to Quark.
4063780	4064780	Drink it.
4064780	4066780	Drink this potion of enlarged person.
4066780	4067780	Snort it.
4068780	4069780	I snort the potion.
4070780	4074780	You snort the potion and immediately grow to giant heights.
4074780	4075780	You almost squeeze everyone else.
4075780	4077780	You are so large in the pit.
4077780	4080780	You feel like you could climb out,
4080780	4082780	but you aren't as tall as the pit.
4082780	4083780	You're still inside.
4083780	4084780	Now you're giant.
4085780	4088780	Can I step on the big jello?
4088780	4090780	You can attempt to step on the jello.
4090780	4093780	I use my giant enlarged foot and squash the big jello.
4094780	4097780	You critically squash the big jello.
4099780	4101780	It's like Price is right.
4104780	4105780	It flies into pieces.
4105780	4107780	The rope is all yours.
4108780	4110780	We use the rope to climb out, I guess, right?
4110780	4111780	You exit the pit.
4116780	4118780	By the sound of that audience applause,
4118780	4121780	I detect a time to stop playing Dungeons and Dragons.
4121780	4124780	I feel like they have decided that it's time to stop.
4124780	4125780	Well, I will say this.
4125780	4126780	That was a close call.
4126780	4127780	Yes.
4127780	4131780	But I have the feeling that inside that encampment with the gnolls,
4131780	4134780	we're going to meet your father either next week,
4134780	4138780	or maybe a week after that, depending on whether or not.
4138780	4142780	Or if we push it long enough, we got until 2013.
4144780	4146780	Before we go on our Harman Tower tour,
4146780	4148780	we're going to meet Lord Butzalot.
4148780	4149780	Yeah, we'll go find him.
4149780	4151780	We'll go bring Tim Curry back.
4153780	4154780	Yes.
4154780	4156780	I'm going to say we promise you Tim Curry next Monday.
4156780	4157780	No, I'm kidding.
4157780	4160780	I really want Tim Curry for Julian Sands,
4160780	4162780	because there are two people that you hang out with.
4162780	4163780	I don't hang out with him.
4163780	4165780	Well, you hang out with him more than I do.
4166780	4170780	My fantasy is to have one of them come on and read Yelp reviews.
4172780	4175780	I want Tim Curry to read Yelp reviews.
4176780	4178780	Outback steakhouse.
4179780	4183780	When we arrived on Tuesday, we thought it would be an ordinary steak.
4184780	4187780	We did not know how poorly we'd be treated.
4187780	4189780	The service was appalling.
4191780	4192780	That would be great.
4192780	4194780	Because I think a lot of people that write those Yelp reviews
4194780	4199780	are picturing themselves as Tim Curry, kind of empowered and British.
4199780	4200780	Thank you, Spencer, everybody.
4200780	4202780	Spencer Crittenden.
4204780	4205780	When it comes to your health,
4205780	4209780	brushing your teeth is one of the most important parts of your day.
4210780	4211780	Quip knows that.
4211780	4215780	They've combined dentistry and design to make a better electric toothbrush.
4216780	4221780	Quip is the new electric toothbrush that packs just the right amount of vibrations
4221780	4227780	into a slimmer design at a fraction of the cost of bulkier, traditional electric brushes.
4227780	4235780	One nice thing about Quip toothbrushes is that they vibrate you with cues to switch tooth sides.
4235780	4237780	Like which side you're brushing?
4237780	4238780	Yes.
4238780	4241780	It also comes with a mount that suctions to your mirror.
4241780	4243780	Yeah, and I've been using my Quip for a little bit,
4243780	4248780	so I can testify to the fact that even though it doesn't sound like a suction sticky holder
4248780	4250780	on your mirror would actually stay on your mirror.
4250780	4251780	It does.
4251780	4255780	Millennials have descended on your least likable activity.
4255780	4258780	The kids are calling it Quip.
4259780	4262780	Millennials are calling it brush toothing.
4262780	4263780	And Time Magazine.
4263780	4265780	And Xers think it's anything but.
4265780	4269780	And Time Magazine is calling it one of the best inventions of the year.
4269780	4271780	Just think about that.
4271780	4274780	Quip is backed by a network of over 10,000 dental professionals,
4274780	4277780	including dentists, hygienists, and dental students.
4277780	4281780	Here's a thing that you're getting with Quip that I noticed when I got my kit.
4281780	4283780	It's like you got a little easy to read booklet there.
4283780	4287780	It's kind of indoctrinating you into a toothbrushing regimen.
4287780	4293780	So it's like if you're into self-care this year, and you should be because the world's dying.
4295780	4300780	It's kind of cool to be in the hands of a bunch of people that have studied toothbrushing
4300780	4305780	to the point where, okay, they're going to send you a new toothbrush head the minute
4306780	4308780	yours is going to be worn out.
4308780	4311780	A new battery the minute this thing stops vibrating.
4311780	4317780	It's a subscription to dental security.
4317780	4319780	Quip starts at just $25.
4319780	4323780	And if you go to getquip.com slash harmontown right now,
4323780	4328780	you'll get your first refill pack for free with a Quip electric toothbrush.
4328780	4333780	That's your first refill pack free at getquip.com slash harmontown.
4333780	4334780	Spell it, you guys.
4334780	4340780	G-E-T-Q-U-I-P dot com slash harmontown.
4340780	4342780	All right, well...
4346780	4347780	Yeah, Dan?
4347780	4349780	Well, it's $9.47.
4349780	4351780	I mean, what else do you want from us?
4351780	4352780	I don't know. We can wrap this thing up.
4352780	4354780	Do you want to bring Jesus up?
4354780	4355780	Oh, yeah, let's do it.
4355780	4356780	Jesus, come on up.
4356780	4357780	You sat in the front row anyway.
4357780	4359780	You got a satchel.
4359780	4362780	Jesus, what's your last name again, Jesus?
4363780	4366780	How do we lose all the microphones?
4366780	4367780	Hi.
4367780	4368780	Okay.
4368780	4371780	So, all right, so how feasible is it?
4371780	4378780	We've learned in recent episodes, you work for a private aeronautics company.
4378780	4380780	Yeah, they launch stuff into space.
4380780	4383780	Yeah, and people are going to be buying tickets and going up into space.
4383780	4385780	Mm-hmm.
4385780	4389780	Is there any way to achieve some kind of coup?
4389780	4392780	I mean, you're not allowed to tell me.
4392780	4398780	Well, like Elon, the main guy, super genius, rich guy who runs the whole thing,
4398780	4401780	he just did this whole story where he was like,
4401780	4404780	yeah, we're going to colonize Mars, which is farther than the moon.
4404780	4406780	Yeah, it seems unnecessary.
4406780	4409780	And he's like, yeah, you know, we'll get 80,000 people,
4409780	4412780	and they'll pay like 500,000 each. It's reasonable, and he's...
4412780	4414780	Don't they have to use the moon as a stepping stone or no?
4414780	4415780	They're going to straight to Mars.
4415780	4417780	They don't have to, but I think they should.
4417780	4418780	I think they should colonize.
4418780	4419780	I mean, it makes more sense.
4419780	4420780	Why not? It's beautiful.
4420780	4422780	Yeah, it's right there, you know.
4422780	4423780	So put a gift shop there.
4423780	4424780	Yeah.
4424780	4425780	Like double your money.
4425780	4426780	Casino, a boat.
4426780	4427780	Really?
4427780	4428780	So Mars...
4428780	4429780	What is it?
4429780	4432780	Because Mars is a planet, and the moon is a moon.
4432780	4433780	Yeah.
4433780	4434780	What did we find there?
4434780	4435780	What do you think Curiosity found?
4435780	4436780	Did we figure that out yet?
4436780	4437780	Do we know?
4437780	4439780	Or like some sort of organic matter, I'm pretty sure.
4439780	4441780	I'm not 100%, you know, I don't...
4441780	4447780	But I think so, you know, like organic matter, some sort of like worm thing, probably.
4447780	4450780	Yeah, some evidence that something existed there at some point.
4450780	4451780	So it's tremors?
4451780	4452780	Some black goo.
4452780	4453780	I don't know.
4453780	4455780	A couple tremors, maybe a couple tremors.
4455780	4456780	Like three.
4456780	4457780	Yeah.
4457780	4459780	So Mars has an atmosphere.
4459780	4460780	It's just not...
4460780	4462780	So we can actually terraform it.
4462780	4465780	Yeah, terraform it and do all this stuff to it.
4465780	4468780	How long did it take to terraform Mars?
4468780	4469780	You know, just a few...
4469780	4470780	I have no idea.
4470780	4472780	Like 20 minutes.
4472780	4473780	20 minutes?
4473780	4474780	20 minutes.
4474780	4475780	On high, right?
4475780	4476780	You have to put it on high.
4476780	4477780	Yeah, yeah.
4477780	4478780	I only scanned the article.
4478780	4481780	I didn't really like, oh, there's going to be tanks of stuff.
4481780	4484780	Well, look, it's 948, or about...
4484780	4486780	But this clock is, I think it's fast.
4486780	4490780	I think probably Mars Rap, right?
4490780	4491780	Mars Rap?
4491780	4492780	Yeah.
4492780	4494780	Or do you want to sum up the night?
4494780	4495780	What are you feeling?
4495780	4496780	Yeah, I just...
4496780	4500780	Well, I felt like I wanted to ask Jesus something else, like...
4500780	4503780	Because it seems like maybe we shouldn't be colonizing the moon then.
4503780	4506780	It sounds like the powers that be, like they know something we don't.
4506780	4507780	Mars.
4507780	4509780	It's easier to move to Mars at this point.
4509780	4511780	You know what I saw on Reddit today?
4511780	4512780	Mm-hmm.
4512780	4513780	They're...
4513780	4517780	Well, I mean, this won't come to fruition for a while, but they figured out faster than
4517780	4518780	light travel.
4518780	4519780	They didn't figure it out.
4519780	4520780	But they're...
4520780	4521780	They...
4521780	4522780	Closer or something exciting happened.
4522780	4523780	They conceded.
4523780	4524780	Yeah.
4524780	4529780	There's a possible future where they kind of have figured it out, where you can create
4529780	4535900	an engine that kind of warps space behind you and then warps space in front of you.
4535900	4540580	And light is only capable of traveling at the speed of light, which, you know, something's
4540580	4541980	five light years away.
4541980	4544820	It takes five years to get there at the speed of light.
4544820	4548500	But you can warp space instantly.
4548500	4550900	You can warp it faster than the speed of light.
4550900	4553280	So like, you kind of like...
4553280	4558780	There's these, you know, conceptual spaceships where you can like create an engine that makes
4558780	4562780	behind the spaceship, like, warp one way and in front of the spaceship warp another
4562780	4569900	way, effectively, like, just making this thing just shoot, like, across space faster than
4569900	4570900	the speed of light.
4570900	4574220	And you could get to Alpha Centauri in two weeks.
4574220	4580380	Anyways, just a heads up on that one, because then you could get to the moon and what?
4580380	4582780	I thought I read that it wasn't true.
4582780	4583780	Really?
4583780	4584780	Yeah.
4584780	4585780	Just...
4585780	4586780	It's all theoretical.
4586780	4587780	The data, like, the test data was...
4588780	4589780	Maybe in earlier attempts.
4589780	4590780	I'm not sure.
4590780	4591780	They also...
4591780	4592780	One more thing.
4592780	4593780	They just...
4593780	4594780	I saw another thing on Reddit.
4594780	4595780	Cambridge or something.
4595780	4599380	They launched an official study going, like, okay, for real, we have to actually start
4599380	4603700	thinking about whether or not robots are going to murder all of us.
4603700	4607940	I don't think they will, because it's such a, like, weird command, like, how would they
4607940	4608940	come up with that?
4608940	4610780	Well, also, they'd have to have this kind of...
4610780	4615340	But one guy said something at the end of the article that kind of stuck with me that it's
4615340	4617020	like, okay, that's the real threat.
4617020	4620220	It's like, guys, like, it's not a question of whether or not robots...
4620220	4623860	I love that scientists are forced to talk about this now.
4623860	4627380	It's not a question of whether or not robots will ever have any malicious intent, because
4627380	4628380	that's a human thing.
4628380	4631620	The whole point of making robots is, like, we hate ourselves and we don't want to be
4631620	4632620	malicious.
4632620	4638660	But the big question is whether or not, at some point, a higher intelligence will find
4638660	4639660	us useless.
4639660	4644500	You know, it will have a plan that doesn't involve us.
4645140	4649060	What I think is just we'll end up uploading our consciousness onto the Internet or something,
4649060	4652460	and then we'll just scroll along with technology, like...
4652460	4653460	Maybe.
4653460	4654460	I mean, I don't know.
4654460	4655460	Jesus, Jesus.
4655460	4656460	I mean...
4656460	4659060	Really, putting your eggs in a small basket.
4659060	4663100	I mean, maybe we'll be running around, like, shooting at them with paintball guns.
4663100	4664100	I don't know.
4664100	4665100	All right.
4665100	4667940	So, we got robots to worry about.
4667940	4669820	That's a thing we shouldn't take to Mars with us.
4669820	4674220	We may need to rethink the moon colonization, maybe go to Mars.
4674260	4677660	I kind of feel like if everyone's going to go to Mars, but we're already on the moon,
4677660	4680140	we'll be, like, the gas station on the way there, like, you know, like...
4680140	4681740	Yeah, you have to pass by Harman Tower.
4681740	4684300	Yeah, we'll be, like, some outpost on Route 66.
4684300	4685300	Yeah.
4685300	4689700	We'll be some quaint little, you know, like, little truck stop on the way to Mars.
4689700	4692460	Do you get milkshakes there?
4692460	4693460	There will be a Shoney's.
4693460	4694460	Big Red will be there.
4694460	4696740	But you can't terraform the moon.
4696740	4699460	I mean, you're just talking about a big, like, bubble.
4699460	4700700	Well, you can.
4700700	4705300	It's actually, they're making, this other guy's, like, making a machine that can just
4705300	4711540	print buildings, and they're saying it'll be a lot easier when you're in space to just
4711540	4715460	use the material of the actual land and, like, melt it into iron, as opposed to bringing
4715460	4719980	a bunch of, like, steel and shit to the planets.
4719980	4720980	Meaning what?
4720980	4723780	That we could just make, like, a big Logan Point city on the moon, and it won't matter.
4723780	4725380	Like, we won't have to terraform the moon.
4725380	4726380	We could just have, like, a...
4726380	4730540	Yeah, you can have, like, a metal base on top of it, and then just, like, you know,
4730540	4733460	basically poop out, like, houses.
4733460	4734460	Yeah.
4734460	4735460	Poop out houses?
4735460	4738620	See, I would like that, because that speaks to, like, if you were going to do that, you
4738620	4740460	would have streets that are just lined up.
4740460	4745180	If we're going to poop out houses, we should bring Daniel Gillies.
4745180	4747180	He's the pooper.
4747180	4749940	I look forward to an age when you go, hey, where are you?
4749940	4751620	I'm going to, where are you hanging out?
4751620	4752620	I'm at A25.
4752620	4758020	Oh, well, I'm at B3, so I know exactly where I'm going to go to meet you.
4758020	4763260	It would be, like, X, 25, Z, something, and then maybe probably, like, three-dimensional,
4763260	4764260	so you'd actually...
4764260	4769580	Yeah, if you need a Y value, like, if you're playing Minecraft, like, how high are you?
4769580	4770580	But...
4770580	4771580	Can I ask a quick question?
4771580	4772580	No.
4772580	4773580	What have you built in Minecraft?
4773580	4774580	Oh.
4774580	4775580	Wait, what?
4775580	4776580	What have you built in Minecraft?
4776580	4777580	Like, something you're proud of?
4777580	4778580	I do a lot of skyscrapers.
4778580	4779580	I keep doing it.
4779580	4781420	We keep starting over every time they come up with an update.
4781420	4786820	We keep making new, because, like, oh, now you can have carrots, but you have to restart
4786820	4787820	the server.
4788620	4794420	Every time I just, and it takes days, I keep making skyscrapers, I just make, and I have
4794420	4796140	to make them out of cooked stone.
4796140	4802860	I can't make them out of cobblestone, which means that I could go on about this.
4802860	4803980	It's a compulsion for me.
4803980	4808580	I make these, like, big gray towers, like, like an evil person.
4808580	4809580	Yo.
4809580	4810580	All right.
4810580	4818020	Hey, Seuss, I'll give you two choices.
4818020	4819020	You can take your seat.
4819020	4820020	I'm not gonna rap.
4820020	4821020	All right.
4821020	4822020	You're not gonna rap?
4822020	4823020	All right.
4823020	4824020	Hey, Seuss, everybody.
4824020	4825020	Hey, Seuss.
4825020	4826020	Hey, Seuss.
4826020	4827020	Hey, Seuss.
4827020	4837220	Well, that's about all the time we got, but I think you know what time it is.
4837220	4840980	It's about time for the time to be up.
4840980	4841980	Yo.
4841980	4842980	Yo.
4842980	4843980	Yo.
4843980	4844980	Yo.
4844980	4845980	Yo.
4845980	4846980	Yo.
4846980	4847980	Chicken dance.
4847980	4848980	Yo.
4848980	4852940	Fuck your mama and your daddy, and I fucked them both twice.
4852940	4856620	I fucked your mama like a rat in two mice.
4856620	4860180	I fucked your mama in a haver in my home.
4860180	4862940	I got a shoe and a hat made of foam.
4862940	4865580	I fucked your mama.
4865580	4866580	I used this...
4866580	4867580	Hold on.
4867580	4868580	Sorry.
4868580	4869580	Sorry.
4869580	4870580	This song doesn't...
4870580	4871580	Yeah.
4871580	4872580	I'm not...
4872580	4873580	I don't...
4873580	4874580	A bad craftsman blames the tools, but...
4874580	4875580	Yeah.
4875580	4876580	We're gonna close with a rap.
4876580	4877580	Yeah.
4877580	4878580	These aren't the best beats in the world.
4878580	4879580	Uh...
4879580	4880580	We might not be able to do it.
4880580	4881580	It's not...
4881580	4886860	Like, I can hear people sighing.
4886860	4887860	So tired.
4887860	4890860	I just feel their pain.
4890860	4891860	Yeah.
4891860	4892860	All right.
4892860	4893860	Okay.
4894140	4895140	Yeah.
4895140	4896140	All right.
4896140	4897140	Okay.
4897140	4898140	Okay.
4898140	4899140	I can tell...
4899140	4900140	I can tell a good closer when I hear it.
4900140	4901140	Yo.
4901140	4902140	65,000 bodies.
4902140	4909820	I'm making up a tragedy that you don't know about.
4909820	4914580	When's that crime gonna be accounted to?
4914580	4916860	Utah.
4916860	4919860	You know what you did.
4919860	4922700	65,000.
4922700	4930300	Never forget, 1922 Utah.
4930300	4933180	You know what happened.
4933180	4940180	Coal mines, 65,000.
4940180	4943180	Don't forget, bitch.
4943180	4945180	Yo.
4945180	4950780	There might never be a beat.
4950780	4952300	There's no beat in Utah.
4953300	4954300	Oh, shit.
4954300	4955300	Yo.
4955300	4956300	Yo.
4956300	4957300	Yeah, Utah.
4957300	4958300	Yo.
4958300	4959300	Yo.
4959300	4960300	Yo.
4960300	4969220	65,000 people died in Utah in the coal mines underneath all y'all.
4969220	4973300	You were all shopping, buying your diamonds and pearls.
4973300	4981300	All these motherfucking people died like little curls of humanity mining your salt from Utah.
4982300	4983300	You should be ashamed of yourself.
4983300	4984300	It's not gonna work.
4984300	4985300	There's no way.
4985300	4986300	I can't...
4986300	4991300	The combination of the concept that I'm going for and then the changing beats and then
4991300	4994300	my reach exceeded my grasp.
4994300	5001300	What I can do is I can rap about how much I fuck your mom.
5001300	5003300	Like to a standard beat.
5003300	5004300	Just barely.
5004300	5007300	That beat was pretty good.
5008300	5009300	All right.
5009300	5010300	All right.
5010300	5011300	It's 9.58.
5011300	5012300	Just bear with me.
5012300	5014300	It will edit all this out.
5014300	5016300	Thank you for coming.
5016300	5017300	Yo.
5017300	5018300	Yo.
