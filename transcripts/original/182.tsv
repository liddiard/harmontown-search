10000	11000	No, obsession.
11000	17000	["I Got A Million Calls I Love To Wear"]
17000	20000	There's thing of Spencer Crittenden, everybody. Spencer.
20000	25000	["I Got A Million Calls I Love To Wear"]
25000	27000	Freshman's Magic Cage.
27000	31000	["I Got A Million Calls I Love To Wear"]
31000	37000	And fresh from taking a giant shit backstage, the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
37000	41000	["I Got A Million Calls I Love To Wear"]
41000	45000	Hello, Los Angeles. It's good to be back.
45000	47000	["I Got A Million Calls I Love To Wear"]
47000	52000	Thank you. I'm in a very bad mood. It's going to be a terrible show.
52000	57000	I just feel like a bad person. I've been doing a lot of stress eating,
57000	62000	and it's because, but also what's making it even worse is that I went,
62000	66000	I gave my doctor blood and said, check my cholesterol,
66000	70000	and then as soon as I gave the blood, I like ran back to the office
70000	73000	and I was like eating Doritos and Twinkies and stuff,
73000	76000	because like they had the blood already.
76000	80000	Right. I can't, I know it's how insane that is, but I'm just like,
80000	83000	okay, well that's just, those numbers are safe.
83000	88000	And then I'm just eating like pizzas and rubbing Philly cheesesteaks on my face.
88000	92000	And it's also because I'm, we're writing Rick and Morty again,
92000	96000	and I'm very like, I'm not doing a good job. I'm like not able to write.
96000	100000	And like I can't break the stories. They're very difficult.
100000	103000	And, you know, I know that Justin's got to be upset with me at this point.
103000	107000	And, but, because I just, it's so fucking, I don't get it.
107000	111000	I don't know, fucking you break the stories and it seems like they make sense.
111000	114000	And then you have to re-break them 50 times.
114000	116000	Is it different this season than in previous seasons?
116000	118000	No, it's never different.
118000	120000	It's never ever, ever, ever been different.
120000	124000	I spent like 20 years like trying to like codify, you know,
124000	127000	that's all me going, you know, that circle thing.
127000	130000	It's me trying as hard as I can to like,
130000	133000	it's like please for the love of Christ, like make this easier.
133000	137000	Like make this like by the numbers, like let me phone something in.
137000	141000	Like I can't fucking do it. It never, like it just, nothing ever makes sense.
141000	143000	And I'm very upset.
143000	145000	I mean, obviously you'd be happier if it were easier,
145000	150000	but isn't that part of the mythology of the joy of what you do is kind of the torture of it all?
150000	154000	Well, I hope to God that, that, that, that,
154000	157000	because I used to think it was possible that I was making it difficult on purpose
157000	161000	so I could like justify, you know, a lot of narcissism and kind of,
161000	164000	but I've, I've crossed into a world, you know, I've been,
164000	168000	I've been to therapy and like I'm perfect now and like,
168000	172000	like I want, I want quality of life and I just want to be happy and I, I'm,
172000	176000	I know I'm old and racist and sexist and I just want to die.
176000	180000	That's how a healthy person feels like at my age, like, like,
180000	183000	an unhealthy person would be like, I'm 25 and I'm not racist.
183000	186000	No, I'm old and racist and I want to die.
186000	187000	I'm not really racist.
187000	189000	I just, it's just better to just say that.
189000	191000	Like it's, it's, it's healthier.
191000	195000	You know who says they're not racist? Donald Trump.
195000	196000	He says that.
196000	201000	Yeah. You know who said he was? Jesus Christ.
201000	202000	And he wasn't.
202000	204000	He just, he was like, that's a nice thing to say.
204000	206000	He just, it's the polite thing to say.
206000	209000	I'm racist. Just in case you are.
209000	212000	It's nice. It's, it's, it's called, it's called tact.
212000	213000	It's like a nice thing to say.
213000	216000	Walk into a party and say, I'm racist.
216000	219000	Where do I hang my coat?
219000	222000	But don't say, don't connect those dots and like, like, like, just,
222000	227000	just don't, don't, don't like look at a person of color and say,
227000	230000	where do I hang my coat?
230000	233000	Like, like, like, like, like, don't connect dots.
233000	237000	Just say you're racist and get through your fucking day and don't be racist.
237000	238000	Thank you.
238000	239000	Yeah.
239000	243000	I'm sexist too. So shut up.
243000	245000	Do you think you're more racist than sexist?
245000	247000	Or is it even Steven in that?
247000	252000	Well, I mean, God knows I hate black women most of all.
252000	254000	So it's kind of a Venn diagram.
254000	255000	Yeah.
255000	257000	No, we can, we can draw different conclusions from that.
257000	260000	You know, yeah, I don't know. I don't know.
260000	261000	I don't know.
261000	268000	What do you think black women have been getting away with?
268000	269000	Yeah.
269000	273000	Let's do a special axe grinding edition of Harman Town.
273000	277000	Can you imagine, can you imagine, but I was like, you know,
277000	280000	as we've talked about this before, how, how crazy it is that like,
280000	283000	like this country, like its legacy, as far as like, you know,
283000	286000	race and gender relations, like kind of can be summed up,
286000	290000	at least in terms of the weird lunacy in that, you know, we,
290000	294000	we freed the slaves and then we're like, you can vote now.
294000	298000	And then like a million years later, we're like, you two ladies.
298000	301000	Like, like, like, like it was, it's, it's weird that like,
301000	305000	can you imagine being like a, like a black woman and like gaining
305000	307000	suffrage, but, but, but not quite.
307000	310000	Like you'd be like at the, depending on what year you were,
310000	312000	you know, you'd be like, yay.
312000	314000	Ah, fuck. God damn it.
314000	316000	Like what is with these people?
316000	322000	And then we'd be like, what do you mean these people?
322000	326000	The hunters become the hunted.
326000	329000	That's good. Just, just, just say you're racist at the next party.
329000	332000	Cause the jig is up, right? Like you, you guys, I mean, you gotta,
332000	334000	you gotta Nazi running for president.
334000	338000	Like, like, like, like, like, like, like this guy, like, like, you know,
338000	341000	come on, like we can't, we can't keep correcting each other's language
341000	343000	and being polite and stuff anymore.
343000	345000	We gotta like start throwing bricks at shit.
345000	348000	Like it's not, we didn't accomplish anything with this last 10 years of like,
348000	354000	like, mind your P's and Q's.
354000	357000	And then all of a sudden there's a fucking Pizza Hut guy running for,
357000	361000	winning, winning, becoming president.
361000	367000	All right. Speaking of racism, uh, I play this game fallout shelter on the iOS.
367000	369000	You guys play it. It's a part of the thing.
369000	374000	Okay. So, so it's like a little buildy game where you have people and you,
374000	378000	you put them in little spots and they have attributes like, you know,
378000	380000	and you're supposed to, you're encouraged to like breed them.
380000	384000	Like, like, because you're told you're supposed to make more dwellers in your
384000	387000	fallout shelter and like their attributes are hereditary.
387000	391000	So if you breed somebody that has like high scores, like those, excuse me,
391000	394000	those, those scores like passed down to their children.
394000	397000	So the way if you're playing the game, right,
397000	400000	then you're picking like somebody and you're putting them up in this special
400000	402000	room. And also like,
402000	404000	there's different outfits that like add to your, um,
404000	408000	at different attributes and the attribute that drives whether you make quickly
408000	411000	or not is charisma. So, so, so, so,
411000	413000	and then there's these special characters.
413000	417000	So there's this, so, so, so there's this guy, long story short,
417000	419000	how did the special characters work?
419000	422000	I don't, there's, there's like these characters that are like,
422000	426000	they're like unlockable. Like, like they arrive, like you get them on cards or
426000	428000	you know, it's like those freemium games. Like you get a car,
428000	431000	you pick, you pay and you get a card. And then sometimes the cards like,
431000	436000	boom, you got like this special guy. Um, and the special guy I got, um,
436000	440000	uh, is a, uh, a young man. Uh,
440000	445000	uh, his pigmentation is darker than the,
445000	449000	what you might call the caucasoid fallout dwellers. Um,
449000	452000	his name is eulogy Jones.
455000	460000	His stats are through the roof across the board. So I couldn't even like,
460000	464000	like, which, which is like, like, like, think about that. I mean,
464000	468000	like, all right. So, so, like, like, like, so I had no choice.
468000	473000	I like, I put him in less like these sexy, like, uh, like, uh,
473000	476000	super charisma pajamas and he's just,
476000	480000	he's just up in a special room and then all the people in the vault,
480000	484000	I have to like, I click on each lady and I go, let's take a look at your,
484000	487000	your strengths and your perception. Okay. You're pretty good.
487000	492000	I put on this 90 you're going up to eulogy and he just boom,
492000	496000	bing, bang, boom. And all the women walk up and everyone in the shelter,
496000	500000	shelter's last name is Jones. You get to dress the characters.
500000	504000	You get to pick what everybody wears as they walk around your shelter. You change
504000	508000	their little outfits and then the different outfits have different bonuses to
508000	511000	different attributes and charisma. So, so, so there's these like,
511000	515000	sleepwear adds to charisma. So you literally are taking like a woman who's
515000	519000	like working hard on like a, like a water purification room and you,
519000	523000	and she's wearing like combat armor because it gives her more strength and
524000	526000	actually perception for the waterproof your kitchen. All right.
526000	530000	Knock it off. Like a lot of people don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
530000	533000	I don't have time to get fucking accurate for the three people that do.
533000	536000	But, but, but you're, you're, you're taking up,
536000	539000	you're taking a woman in the prime of her working career and you're like,
539000	542000	like, like clicking on her, her, her, her combat armor,
542000	546000	changing it into a slinky nighty and shooting her up to this fucking dude.
546000	550000	Yeah. To eulogy Jones, who just jumps on her and fucking like takes her in the
550000	553000	back and there's like little blue green smile faces and then she comes out
553000	558000	limping and pregnant and then you send her back to work.
561000	565000	It sounds like you're like the leader of a really like awesome cult.
566000	569000	Yeah. Anyways, it's a, all right.
569000	572000	So is there an option to make one of these women,
572000	574000	the high status breeder? You could,
574000	576000	you could put a woman up there and send men up to her.
576000	579000	Sure. Yes. But eulogy Jones is like, there's no comparing.
579000	583000	Like, like he's like, he has like almost like just stats.
583000	585000	Yes. You would, it would be great to, to,
585000	589000	it would be, it would be more in keeping with a sort of like biological tradition,
589000	592000	right? Like the keeper of the egg stays stationary and then you keep shooting
592000	596000	sperm matter, you know, like, like, like, like, like insects, you know,
596000	599000	going to the queen, you know, like you're up Hank,
599000	603000	you're going up to the, the boss lady. It's your time in the barrel today.
603000	606000	Get your, get your dick out, you little fucking drone.
607000	611000	Unfortunately, that's not how it worked out in Harmon shelter.
611000	616000	All right. So, uh, I got, I got, I took an Uber, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
616000	620000	cause it's a great organization that deserves as much support as possible.
620000	626000	And, uh, I want to pick me up and I wanted to pick up, you know, uh, uh,
626000	630000	shrub because, cause he, he needs a ride in order to do the show.
630000	635000	And, uh, and I, I told, I'm telling the guy how to, uh, drive to the place.
635000	639000	And I go, go up here, take a right on this street. And then what?
639000	644000	And then, well, then you'll take another right. Um, uh, which street, uh,
644000	649000	as I don't, I, I'll show you which one I think I, it's, it's just a, it's a,
649000	654000	it's a stop sign up. I think I, I want to say Ambrose, uh, but, uh,
654000	659000	I'll show you driving comes and he gets to the street.
659000	663000	It's avocado. He takes her right. I go, I go, take a right, right here.
663000	668000	He goes, uh-huh. It's avocado. He corrected me.
668000	673000	I was very clear in the fact that I was not like, like sure what the street was
673000	678000	and he fucking couldn't resist. It's avocado. Yeah. I see the sign too.
678000	683000	Like I said, you got me. Does an Uber make you or require a request
683000	686000	that you type in your destination address when you get in the car?
686000	690000	No, I do that for my own convenience, but I, first I needed to pick up shrub
690000	694000	shrub and then go to this location. So I didn't want to freak anybody out
694000	697000	or I don't know how that would work. I don't want to put in his address.
697000	701000	All right. That's it. That's all I got. Let's, let's, um,
701000	705000	let's turn it over to, uh, uh, uh, our, uh, some of our friends starting with,
705000	708000	uh, let's bring out Rob shrub.
720000	732000	Speaking of, uh, sexy nightwear and attributes,
732000	736000	did you just come from Ulogy Jones' place?
736000	744000	I was sitting on the couch with my wonderful wife and my perfect dog
744000	750000	watching an LA story and said, it's a good movie.
750000	758000	What a wonderful fuck.
758000	761000	Would you please do the show?
761000	764000	It was like an hour before we got here.
764000	766000	Will you please do the show?
766000	769000	They like you.
769000	771000	He likes you too, right?
771000	773000	I know. I know. The kids love him.
773000	780000	Dan in a moment of weakness told me that he really enjoys you in the show.
780000	787000	And I think without him having said too much, I think it's a rekindling of your guys' friendship.
787000	790000	Well, here, let's do the, let's do the actual conversation.
790000	792000	Oh, should I get on my phone?
792000	793000	Yeah, yeah.
793000	795000	All right. Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
795000	797000	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't go yet.
798000	800000	If you scroll up high enough, Rob, yeah, Rob always,
800000	806000	he sent me some kind of video of a slow motion of someone throwing a baseball at a batter
806000	816000	and just before the batter hits the ball, it cuts to a woman peeing all over other women.
816000	818000	But like a fire hose.
818000	819000	Yeah.
819000	820000	All right.
820000	823000	What do you do with your phone?
823000	825000	What do you text?
826000	831000	Okay, so do you want to play each other?
831000	832000	What do you do?
832000	833000	Or ourselves?
833000	834000	Which part do you want?
834000	836000	Dealer's choice. Just start.
836000	837000	What?
837000	839000	Well, I'll play you. You play me.
839000	840000	Okay.
842000	848000	This was at 10 to 7 tonight.
849000	852000	Mmm.
853000	854000	Whoop.
854000	856000	I'm in town tonight.
857000	858000	Whoop.
858000	859000	Please.
859000	861000	Everyone loves you.
863000	867000	Dude, it's an hour before your show.
869000	870000	Whoop.
870000	872000	I'm not organized.
873000	878000	There's no, there's no guess you'll have fun.
878000	884000	Like, like that's the thing that makes me have fun or not.
884000	886000	If there's like a guest.
886000	890000	You always get a little antsy when, you know, people come up and they want to talk about
890000	895000	their illness that they're struggling with and you like turn into a six-year-old in church,
895000	901000	you know, making armpit farts and someone's just survived some leukemia or something.
901000	903000	I don't even think you can.
903000	905000	I'm not organized.
905000	908000	There's no guess you'll have fun.
911000	914000	You have two assistants.
914000	920000	Remember last we talked and I thought I said, please just come every week.
924000	925000	Yeah.
925000	929000	And you didn't tell me there wasn't a show last week.
932000	933000	Yeah.
940000	941000	Extra text.
941000	945000	I looked like an idiot all alone on the stage.
948000	949000	All right.
949000	955000	I'll tell Steve that you're a regular part of the show so he could be on top of it if
955000	957000	you come tonight.
957000	960000	If you pick me up, okay.
961000	963000	And heart my grams.
963000	964000	Okay.
968000	969000	I need every heart.
969000	971000	I need every, every heart I can get.
971000	973000	It's a jungle out there.
975000	976000	And then whoop.
976000	977000	Oops.
977000	979000	I kind of fucked up.
979000	983000	Just called Uber now and it's 10 minutes away from my place so we're going to be rolling
983000	987000	into meltdown like 8.05.
988000	990000	Oh no.
991000	994000	Is that a, is that a, you were being sarcastic, right?
994000	995000	Yeah.
997000	999000	Saints Preserve us.
999000	1000000	Holy cow.
1000000	1002000	8.05?
1002000	1003000	Man.
1003000	1005000	I have to find three different kinds of pajamas.
1005000	1006000	Yeah.
1007000	1011000	Luckily I was wearing my only bear.
1012000	1013000	Heading to you now.
1013000	1014000	That's it.
1014000	1015000	Okay.
1015000	1016000	Pulling up.
1016000	1017000	All right.
1017000	1020000	I'm glad you guys had fun listening to that.
1022000	1023000	All right.
1023000	1025000	I can't find my pocket now.
1025000	1027000	So I heard you got a pedicure.
1027000	1030000	You told me on the car ride over here.
1030000	1034000	Well, an ounce of prevention is worth a pedicure.
1041000	1043000	Hey man, you picked them.
1043000	1045000	The kids, the kids love them.
1046000	1048000	And I, you know, I just, I was in a bad mood.
1048000	1052000	It's like, let's bring the guy that the kid's like, you know, the crazy uncle.
1052000	1053000	Yeah.
1053000	1058000	It's like so irritable and like, I feel like Mercury's in retrograde as my, uh, my, my,
1058000	1065000	my astrology, uh, uh, believing ex-girlfriend, uh, Robin used to say every two weeks.
1065000	1067000	Mercury's in retrograde.
1067000	1068000	Yeah.
1068000	1069000	Seems like every two weeks.
1069000	1072000	Every time your iPad doesn't play music, it's Mercury's in retrograde.
1072000	1076000	It could also affect traffic and parking and like, but I do think it's interesting to
1076000	1077000	have as part of your mythology.
1077000	1080000	Cause like, sometimes, you know, you have those days and you just feel sort of like
1080000	1082000	you're out of, you're out of sync.
1082000	1083000	Yeah.
1083000	1085000	Like you felt like everything you do is clumsy.
1085000	1089000	Everything you, uh, everything you say is like ill timed or like, like every, it's
1089000	1090000	like, nothing's working.
1090000	1093000	You're like out of sync with the Lord.
1093000	1094000	Yeah.
1094000	1096000	There's also a full moon yesterday too, right?
1096000	1097000	Yeah.
1098000	1103000	When all the planets align, didn't like all the planets align and then there was a full
1103000	1107000	moon, somebody thought I read that all the planets were aligned.
1107000	1112000	Like all of them, all, every single planet in the universe were in a straight line.
1113000	1114000	Yeah.
1114000	1115000	What's that?
1115000	1117000	February 2nd.
1117000	1119000	All the planets will be aligned.
1119000	1120000	Everyone?
1120000	1122000	Every planet will be aligned.
1122000	1124000	Even that, even that new one they just found?
1124000	1125000	They found a new planet.
1125000	1127000	It's going to be in the front of the line.
1129000	1130000	Yeah.
1130000	1132000	Before that, before like mercury?
1132000	1134000	Well, yeah, yeah.
1134000	1135000	Okay.
1135000	1136000	Yeah.
1136000	1137000	Well, where did they find this new planet?
1137000	1138000	Way the fuck out there.
1138000	1139000	Okay.
1139000	1140000	Maybe it's the other side of the line.
1140000	1141000	Okay.
1141000	1142000	I mean, yeah.
1142000	1144000	It's the front of the line, depending which way you're, which is the front.
1144000	1145000	Well, yeah.
1145000	1149000	I feel like all planets are trying to get into the rest of the universe, right?
1149000	1151000	So the front of the line would be out there.
1151000	1152000	They'd be going away.
1152000	1153000	They'd be going away, man.
1153000	1154000	They'd be going away.
1154000	1156000	They don't want to be by no sun.
1156000	1157000	No, no.
1157000	1158000	They'd be going away.
1158000	1159000	They'd be going all the way.
1159000	1160000	Yeah.
1160000	1164000	If I were a planet, I wouldn't want to be the first to be devoured by the gravity and the
1164000	1165000	heat of the sun.
1165000	1166000	No, no.
1166000	1167000	I'd hate that.
1167000	1168000	No.
1168000	1169000	God, no.
1169000	1170000	That wouldn't be me.
1170000	1171000	However.
1171000	1172000	No, I wouldn't want that either.
1172000	1173000	Where in line would you like to be?
1173000	1174000	Would you like to be the farthest one out, Rob?
1174000	1175000	Would you like to be like?
1175000	1177000	Ah, you know, in the, the late middle.
1177000	1180000	I see you as kind of a Neptune kind of a guy.
1180000	1181000	You're out there.
1181000	1182000	You're big and gassy.
1182000	1183000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1183000	1184000	You're big, gassy, blue.
1184000	1190120	Is this going to be, is this one of our little fun sketches where Rob is Neptune and then
1190120	1193000	we start improvising and it's really fun and joyful?
1193000	1194000	Not yet.
1194000	1195000	Okay.
1195000	1196000	All right.
1196000	1197000	Thank you.
1197000	1198000	No, no.
1198000	1199000	All right.
1199000	1200000	Well, I just, look.
1200000	1202400	The, the, the, the, the, the, the, but the, the, the things on the outskirts of the solar
1202400	1209000	system like, like we've, we've, we've, here's something I've always wanted to know.
1210000	1215000	How come when we, when we, when we go into space, how come we've never gone down?
1218000	1220000	We're always going to the moon.
1221000	1222000	We're always going there.
1222000	1224000	We're always sending stuff out.
1224000	1225000	We pass much.
1225000	1227000	How come we don't go down?
1227000	1228000	Into the earth?
1228000	1229000	Somebody, what?
1229000	1230000	Into the center of the earth?
1230000	1231000	No.
1231000	1232000	No, no, no.
1232000	1233000	We've always gone.
1233000	1234000	How come we're always in this two-dimensional plane?
1234000	1235000	We go to Mars.
1235000	1236000	The planets.
1236000	1240000	Why don't we go down?
1240000	1244000	Why don't we ever go down?
1244000	1247000	We could go up too, but we always go.
1247000	1248000	Why do we always go?
1248000	1249000	Why do we always go?
1249000	1252000	Well, we're going to go to, we're going to go to, we're going to go to the moon, and
1252000	1255000	then we're going to go to Mars, and then maybe we'll go all this way.
1255000	1256000	There might be solar right under us.
1256000	1257000	We could.
1257000	1259000	There might be a whole other solar system right under us.
1259000	1260000	We never want.
1260000	1262000	There might be like an apartment complex.
1262000	1265000	There might be a sun under the sun.
1265000	1266000	Even in station.
1266000	1267000	Oh, shit.
1267000	1270000	It's like everybody, you see some, a rocket takes off.
1270000	1271000	It just goes left.
1271000	1274000	It doesn't go, we never go down.
1274000	1275000	You know?
1275000	1280000	And I think the South Pole needs a rocket.
1280000	1284000	They teach you when you're making those little like mobiles of the solar system, it's just
1284000	1285000	a flat thing.
1285000	1286000	Yeah.
1286000	1288000	Why don't they ever go down?
1288000	1291000	Because then you'd hit a baby.
1292000	1296000	That's because it's based on a mobile, mobile, mobile.
1296000	1297000	Oh, shit.
1297000	1298000	We're indoctrinated.
1298000	1299000	Oh.
1299000	1304000	We learned since childhood, even all of NASA scientists grew up looking at, the first thing
1304000	1309000	they saw about wildlife was a thing above their crib, and so we're all, we've all gone crazy.
1309000	1312000	Do you think that's why there's the baby in 2001 Space Odyssey?
1312000	1313000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1313000	1314000	That's the baby.
1314000	1315000	He went down.
1315000	1316000	Yeah, yeah.
1316000	1318000	The baby's down here.
1318000	1323000	In the director's cut, like he's like floating, and he kind of turns, and he's looking, he's
1323000	1328000	going to break the fourth wall, and they cut, but in the director's cut, he goes, we should
1328000	1333000	have went, we don't go down.
1333000	1335000	Why don't we ever go down?
1335000	1340000	And it pulls out, and there's a big crib, and then it keeps pulling out, and it's like
1340000	1341000	a nursery.
1341000	1346000	Yeah, and then it's under a big triangle eye, Illuminati.
1347000	1352000	And then it keeps pulling out, and there's a Jew.
1358000	1361000	I'm racist.
1361000	1364000	The power, the freedom.
1364000	1365000	Sorry, I dropped my phone.
1365000	1372000	You reacted more to my phone dropping than my anti-Semitism.
1372000	1374000	It's the Trump factor.
1375000	1378000	Why are we so afraid of going down?
1378000	1380000	His phone just went down.
1380000	1381000	You saw what happened.
1381000	1382000	Yeah, it broke.
1382000	1386000	I mean, like, we never went down.
1386000	1389000	I think there's something down there.
1389000	1395000	Why don't we bring out a resident astronomical spokesperson, Jonah Ray.
1405000	1410000	Hey, resident astronomical spokesman.
1410000	1413000	This is what I look like.
1413000	1414000	This is what you were doing at home.
1414000	1416000	This is what I look like.
1416000	1419000	I was in heaven.
1419000	1422000	And then these look like comfortable shoes.
1422000	1424000	They're Uggs.
1424000	1425000	They sure are.
1425000	1428000	Are you guys attracted to women in Uggs?
1428000	1431000	I'd say quite the opposite.
1431000	1434000	I'm very turned on by women in tights and Uggs.
1434000	1437000	Like the combo or just either are?
1437000	1441000	I ordered from each...
1441000	1445000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1445000	1447000	That is yours to keep, sir.
1447000	1448000	That is yours to keep.
1448000	1450000	Toss it back.
1450000	1451000	Toss it back.
1451000	1452000	Thank you.
1452000	1454000	I ordered E24.
1454000	1457000	I ordered E24 like a couple weeks ago.
1458000	1460000	And I was dressed like this.
1460000	1462000	And I went down to get my green leaves.
1462000	1465000	And then I'm signing for it.
1465000	1469000	And then the guy, as I'm signing for it, the guy goes,
1469000	1470000	those are cool.
1470000	1471000	They should make them for guys.
1471000	1473000	And walk the fuck away.
1473000	1475000	No.
1475000	1476000	Wow.
1476000	1477000	No.
1477000	1479000	This is the guy that works at green leaves?
1479000	1481000	Was he a Wahlberg?
1481000	1484000	Should have got burgers from Wahlbergers.
1484000	1485000	Dude got Wahlberg.
1486000	1487000	You know what?
1487000	1490000	It's because he was watching the Entourage marathon
1490000	1492000	that was happening all weekend.
1492000	1493000	That sucks.
1493000	1495000	And I already signed it.
1495000	1497000	And I already gave him a tip.
1497000	1500000	And I was like...
1500000	1501000	You still would have gave him a tip
1501000	1503000	even if he had said that beforehand.
1503000	1505000	Yeah.
1505000	1507000	You should have said, nice joke.
1507000	1511000	You should have...
1511000	1512000	Wait.
1512000	1513000	Nice...
1513000	1514000	Yes, you got it.
1514000	1515000	No, no, no.
1515000	1516000	You got it, Dan.
1516000	1517000	It was pretty much like...
1517000	1518000	Nice joke.
1518000	1520000	I would have enjoyed hearing it from the first person
1520000	1522000	who originally came up with it
1522000	1525000	because then it would have been forgivable
1525000	1528000	due to, like, it would have been a spontaneous...
1528000	1531000	At this point, he would have been back to green leaves.
1534000	1535000	It's a hack, you know?
1535000	1536000	That's the thing.
1536000	1537000	That's what really bums me out.
1537000	1538000	But it worked.
1538000	1539000	I was all bummed out.
1539000	1540000	Was he trying to zing you?
1540000	1541000	Or was he being like in general?
1541000	1543000	I don't think he was trying to zing me,
1543000	1544000	which made it worse.
1544000	1545000	He was being...
1545000	1546000	Sincere.
1546000	1547000	Like...
1547000	1548000	No.
1548000	1550000	Hey, look at those queer-looking feet you got.
1550000	1552000	What would make these for guys?
1552000	1553000	More manly?
1553000	1554000	I don't know.
1554000	1555000	Spikes?
1555000	1557000	They're brown?
1557000	1558000	They got, like...
1558000	1559000	Laces?
1559000	1560000	With laces?
1560000	1561000	Yeah.
1561000	1562000	I mean, it's more...
1562000	1563000	Spurs?
1563000	1564000	It's more clear that animals had to die
1564000	1565000	to make those than it is for animals.
1565000	1566000	Oh, don't say that.
1566000	1567000	And skin.
1567000	1568000	And rubber.
1568000	1569000	Maybe the green leaves guys like Dan
1569000	1570000	and when he sees those,
1570000	1571000	he thinks of women in tights.
1571000	1572000	Okay, now you bum me out.
1572000	1573000	Yeah, that's the thing.
1573000	1574000	This is not vegan friendly.
1574000	1575000	You ordered from a vegan restaurant.
1575000	1579000	He was right to call you a queer.
1579000	1580000	That's probably true.
1580000	1581000	These aren't vegan.
1581000	1583000	Okay, I'm getting none of these.
1583000	1586000	Throw them back in the audience.
1586000	1588000	You had a chance to throw them...
1588000	1589000	No, because someone might put them on and go,
1589000	1590000	these are really comfortable,
1590000	1594000	and then run into a field and kill a lamb.
1594000	1595000	For Valentine's Day.
1595000	1596000	Honey, you gotta try this.
1596000	1600000	Spencer, Spencer, these are definitely, like, what?
1600000	1601000	They're made out of pork.
1601000	1602000	Oh, shit.
1602000	1603000	All right.
1603000	1604000	All right.
1604000	1605000	I'm getting rid of them.
1605000	1606000	They're shear lamb.
1606000	1607000	I mean, they're...
1607000	1608000	Shear lamb?
1608000	1609000	Yeah.
1609000	1610000	Shear lamb.
1610000	1611000	What did you think they were...
1611000	1612000	What does that mean?
1612000	1613000	Yeah.
1613000	1614000	Like...
1614000	1615000	They shear the lamb.
1615000	1618000	Like, they pull the skin off of the lamb.
1618000	1619000	Okay.
1619000	1621000	Yeah, but what's wrapped around them?
1621000	1622000	The outside...
1622000	1623000	More lamb skin.
1623000	1624000	That's definitely...
1624000	1625000	More lamb.
1625000	1626000	That's leather you're wearing.
1626000	1628000	Okay, well, I should have done my research
1628000	1630000	before I did my billion Facebook posts.
1631000	1632000	You're bad.
1632000	1634000	You feel good now that your feet are swathed
1634000	1635000	and had a nice lamb sandwich?
1635000	1636000	Okay, I'm getting rid of them.
1636000	1637000	All right.
1637000	1638000	All right.
1638000	1639000	Who wants them?
1639000	1640000	Who wants them?
1640000	1641000	But now your feet are gonna...
1641000	1642000	What are your feet...
1642000	1643000	What are your feet made out of?
1643000	1644000	Gross.
1644000	1645000	And that's why...
1645000	1646000	Oh, good.
1646000	1647000	That's good.
1647000	1648000	Just separate them.
1648000	1649000	Separate them.
1649000	1650000	Hold on, hold on.
1650000	1651000	Give them both to the same person, at least.
1651000	1652000	No, no, no.
1652000	1653000	No!
1653000	1654000	The two different people will find them
1654000	1655000	and then they'll know true love
1655000	1656000	once they come together.
1656000	1657000	Oh.
1657000	1659000	Tale as old as time.
1659000	1660000	How much is this a cod?
1660000	1662000	Do you think there's any wool on you?
1662000	1664000	Let's get you fucking naked.
1664000	1667000	I hope you're covered in wool.
1667000	1668000	Look at the tag.
1668000	1669000	Look at the tag.
1669000	1670000	Look at the tag.
1670000	1673000	Oh, is it the oldest trick in the book?
1673000	1674000	There's no tag on the back of this.
1674000	1676000	It's just your shirt.
1676000	1678000	It says pork.
1678000	1681000	Oh, shit.
1684000	1685000	All right.
1685000	1687000	We'll strip him down of his animal products
1687000	1688000	and then we'll slowly introduce him
1688000	1690000	into the sweatshop thing.
1690000	1691000	Yeah.
1691000	1693000	That's velour.
1697000	1698000	All right.
1698000	1700000	I worked at a sweatshop.
1700000	1702000	I worked at a sweatshop down in Vernon, California.
1702000	1703000	Okay.
1703000	1704000	Yeah.
1704000	1705000	I worked with a bunch of Russian ladies
1705000	1708000	and then I was fired because they...
1708000	1709000	You didn't sweat enough.
1709000	1710000	I didn't sweat enough.
1710000	1712000	It's because I spoke English
1712000	1713000	and the guy was like,
1713000	1714000	you must be good at computers.
1714000	1716000	And then he made me try to do spreadsheets
1716000	1717000	and I was real bad at Excel.
1717000	1719000	And then he says, you're fucking fired.
1719000	1721000	And you're like, put me back with the Russian women.
1721000	1722000	He says like, wait, no.
1722000	1723000	I asked.
1723000	1725000	I said, I was pretty good at putting buttons on jeans.
1725000	1728000	He said, no, you weren't.
1728000	1729000	Wow.
1729000	1730000	Yeah.
1730000	1731000	What were you making?
1731000	1732000	What was the product?
1732000	1736000	It was a brand that I had never heard of.
1736000	1739000	I think it was called Leaf Eyes.
1739000	1742000	It was some like just like off-brand jean.
1742000	1744000	And I was just putting on the top button
1744000	1746000	above the zipper.
1746000	1749000	That was all I did all day for like...
1749000	1751000	Were they riveted on or stitched on?
1751000	1752000	They were riveted.
1752000	1754000	I used a riveter.
1754000	1756000	And then that's all I did.
1756000	1758000	How big was the riveter?
1762000	1763000	How big was it?
1763000	1765000	It was about as big as you mimed.
1765000	1766000	Yeah.
1769000	1771000	I'm still bummed out about the whole Ugg thing.
1771000	1773000	I should have known that.
1773000	1776000	It's weird because it's such a go-to for people who are
1776000	1778000	defensive about the animal thing.
1778000	1780000	The first thing they learn to say is like,
1780000	1782000	what do you think your shoes and your belt are made of?
1782000	1783000	I know.
1783000	1785000	I got rid of all my shoes and my belts and my wallet,
1785000	1787000	but I didn't think of my Uggs because I'm stupid.
1787000	1789000	Is Dan gonna have to carry you to the Uber like officer
1789000	1790000	and a gentleman on the way out of here?
1790000	1791000	God damn it.
1791000	1792000	He better.
1792000	1793000	You better.
1793000	1796000	Well, I don't think you should feel that bad because,
1796000	1799000	I mean, as much as I'm sure you'd love to have a perfect like
1799000	1801000	no animal effect record.
1801000	1802000	It's impossible.
1802000	1804000	It's much more important to like, I mean,
1804000	1806000	a reduction is good, right?
1806000	1807000	Yeah.
1807000	1808000	Something is better than nothing.
1808000	1811000	It's really impossible.
1811000	1812000	It's really hard.
1812000	1814000	Well, you know, we are fucking crazy,
1814000	1817000	super evolved monkeys that like had,
1817000	1819000	I mean, we're carnivorous.
1819000	1820000	We're omnivorous.
1820000	1825000	Like we can figure out how to evolve and subsist by not
1825000	1827000	hurting animals, but like, I mean,
1827000	1831000	we do live by murdering.
1831000	1832000	We do.
1832000	1834000	No, you're right.
1834000	1835000	Do you know?
1835000	1836000	I do.
1836000	1839000	Plants are, plants are alive.
1839000	1842000	They just, you know, some plants kill.
1842000	1843000	That's the thing.
1843000	1844000	Everyone's all high and mighty about plants,
1844000	1846000	but they fucking murder flies in this fly trap.
1846000	1847000	This is, this is not me.
1847000	1849000	This is not me being a person that's saying like,
1849000	1851000	oh, we might as well eat a bunch of cows.
1851000	1854000	Like that's all I'm trying to let a guy off the hook
1854000	1855000	that's giving himself a hard time.
1855000	1856000	I mean, you're doing it.
1856000	1859000	I've been vegetarian for like 22 or three years.
1859000	1860000	Here we go.
1861000	1865000	But I have one, one weakness, ribs.
1865000	1869000	I have leather shoes and a belt and a wallet.
1869000	1872000	So I'm a hypocritical vegetarian all the way.
1872000	1874000	You know, I mean, I think, you know,
1874000	1878000	like nobody wants to think of things in terms of just a,
1878000	1882000	a statistics and reduction because then you're feeling
1882000	1883000	like you're like, oh,
1883000	1887000	I'm only going to kill a certain amount of things with my life.
1888000	1889000	Doesn't every little thing.
1889000	1891000	It's like, it's, it shouldn't the goal be more.
1891000	1893000	It shouldn't be, it shouldn't be about absolutes.
1893000	1895000	It should be about like a reduction of a set.
1895000	1897000	So now, now Rob's Ugg Boot,
1897000	1899000	Rob's Ugg Boot is being passed around the audience
1899000	1902000	and it just emerged with a flask of tequila inside.
1902000	1905000	Is it like a magical lug boot?
1907000	1910000	Now it's just being passed around like a weird flask.
1910000	1912000	People, people are drinking out of your Ugg Boot.
1912000	1914000	Drink, drink the boot.
1914000	1916000	Drink the boot.
1916000	1918000	Hashtag drink the boot.
1918000	1920000	Drink the boot.
1920000	1922000	Drink the boot.
1922000	1924000	Drink the boot.
1924000	1925000	Here's the thing.
1925000	1926000	We're all forgetting it's an Ugg Boot
1926000	1928000	and it will immediately just soak up all the booze.
1928000	1930000	So then you're going to have to squeeze the boat.
1930000	1931000	Squeeze the boat.
1931000	1932000	Find a camera today.
1932000	1933000	Squeeze the boot.
1933000	1934000	Get up here, stand up here.
1934000	1935000	What is your name?
1935000	1936000	Ethan.
1936000	1937000	Ethan, of course.
1937000	1938000	I know Ethan.
1938000	1939000	Don't drink it like that.
1939000	1940000	It's just a koozie that way.
1940000	1942000	Shut up and laugh and I ticked it sideways.
1942000	1944000	Find a camera and drink the boot.
1944000	1945000	Yeah, look ahead.
1945000	1947000	You sound like a porn director.
1947000	1949000	Find the camera, drink the boot.
1952000	1955000	Oh yeah, it's real boot liquor.
1956000	1958000	Oh shit.
1958000	1959000	She snuck in here.
1959000	1960000	I was there when she got in.
1960000	1962000	Drink the boot.
1962000	1964000	I'm actually going to go to the bathroom doing this.
1964000	1966000	Okay.
1966000	1967000	I don't believe it.
1967000	1969000	You're going to go to the bathroom with no shoes on?
1969000	1970000	That's so gross.
1970000	1972000	She's going to soak up pee in your socks.
1972000	1975000	This was your moment and Shrob just decided to leave.
1975000	1976000	All right.
1976000	1977000	Thank you.
1977000	1978000	Ethan.
1978000	1979000	Thanks Ethan.
1979000	1980000	Pass the boot around.
1980000	1981000	Pass the boot.
1981000	1982000	He's going to...
1982000	1986000	Shrob's going to walk back on with like piss sticky feet.
1986000	1989000	He's going to be fucking sick.
1989000	1991000	Well, are we going to...
1991000	1992000	You know what?
1992000	1994000	This is as good as Shrob.
1994000	2002000	Are we going to applaud his vegan values or are we going to...
2002000	2003000	No.
2003000	2004000	Are we going to piss foot shame him?
2004000	2005000	I mean, like this is...
2005000	2006000	Why can't we do both?
2006000	2009000	We're reliving the fall for grace and humanity.
2009000	2014000	I would rather Rob have animals on his feet than walk through peepy town with the socks on.
2014000	2016000	As long as you've got eyes wide open about that.
2016000	2017000	Yeah.
2017000	2018000	Okay.
2018000	2020000	Let's kill animals so our lives aren't gross.
2020000	2021000	I mean, that is the deal we made.
2021000	2026000	And then the slippery slope as we started going, what about poor people?
2026000	2027000	Who?
2027000	2028000	Are they?
2028000	2034000	I mean, they sound like they're mooing to me.
2034000	2039000	I guess it's just my penthouse apartment, but all I hear is a kind of drone.
2039000	2042000	It sounds like a moo.
2042000	2044000	I mean, you know, I'm not saying eat them.
2044000	2046000	We got all this pork, but...
2046000	2047000	But what if we did?
2047000	2050000	But what if we ate their happiness?
2050000	2051000	Yes!
2051000	2058000	What if most of them killed themselves and each other because we just leached their fucking energy off of them?
2058000	2062000	You know that feeling when you walk by a homeless person that you don't give any money to,
2062000	2064000	and then when that feeling of guilt goes away?
2064000	2067000	That's the best feeling in the world.
2067000	2071000	If we could bottle that.
2071000	2074000	It's like socio-political anal beads.
2074000	2075000	Yes.
2075000	2077000	It's better on the way out.
2077000	2082000	Causing trauma to just...
2082000	2084000	There must be, like, a way to yank.
2084000	2086000	Because it's always such a slow process.
2086000	2089000	You've got to pat their fake pockets when you walk by, and then it's a block later,
2089000	2092000	you're kind of feeling a little bit of relief.
2092000	2093000	So how do you yank it?
2093000	2094000	Like on a skateboard?
2094000	2096000	Like a skateboard past a homeless guy?
2096000	2097000	I can't...
2097000	2098000	Whoa! Yeah!
2098000	2099000	Yeah.
2099000	2100000	Going in.
2100000	2101000	Not so fun.
2101000	2102000	On the way out.
2102000	2103000	Boy, oh boy.
2103000	2108000	My friend who used to work in the returns department at a sex toy shop.
2108000	2109000	No!
2109000	2110000	Is that allowed?
2110000	2111000	There was...
2111000	2115000	My two friends of mine actually worked in the returns department at a sex toy shop.
2115000	2117000	They needed two people on that job.
2117000	2119000	There's a flood of people coming in.
2119000	2120000	Yeah.
2120000	2122000	Look, apparently, like, they would work late nights,
2122000	2123000	and people would bring...
2123000	2126000	Like, stuff would come back in clearly having been re-boxed.
2126000	2130000	Like, meaning they tried it on or in for size.
2130000	2131000	And now they...
2132000	2133000	This wasn't what I wanted.
2133000	2134000	But that's illegal.
2134000	2135000	I would imagine.
2135000	2136000	It's a biohazard.
2136000	2138000	But they also worked in the sex shop,
2138000	2142000	and my friend Israel worked in the shop, and he...
2142000	2144000	And Gargamel worked...
2144000	2147000	Would mop the peep booths.
2148000	2150000	And they said that a guy came in late night...
2150000	2151000	There was also a storefront.
2151000	2154000	There was the brick and mortar front of the shop
2154000	2157000	that you could go in and buy sex toys.
2157000	2159000	And a guy pulls up late at night,
2159000	2161000	and they hated this job more than anything, as you can imagine.
2161000	2163000	And this guy pulls up in a fancy sports car
2163000	2165000	with a hot drunk check-out in the car,
2165000	2166000	and he comes in, he's super drunk,
2166000	2167000	and he's like,
2167000	2169000	Hey, I want to get some sex toys with a lady.
2169000	2170000	Come on.
2170000	2171000	And they're like,
2171000	2172000	Oh, she got...
2172000	2173000	Have you tried anal beads?
2173000	2174000	No, what do those do?
2174000	2175000	He's like,
2175000	2176000	Have her put these into your butt,
2176000	2178000	and right as you're about to come...
2178000	2179000	No, no.
2179000	2181000	Tell her to pull them out as hard as she can
2181000	2182000	and scream,
2182000	2183000	and scream,
2183000	2184000	Geronimo!
2186000	2187000	He's like,
2187000	2188000	Really? That works.
2188000	2189000	I did that.
2189000	2191000	I'm hoping that guy's alive still.
2192000	2194000	Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
2194000	2196000	The El Geronimo?
2196000	2198000	You're not supposed to pull them out.
2198000	2199000	You're starting a lawnmower.
2199000	2200000	You're not?
2200000	2201000	No.
2201000	2202000	I thought...
2202000	2203000	Everything I know about anal beads,
2203000	2205000	I learned from stand-up comics.
2206000	2208000	I love that book.
2211000	2214000	Chicken soup for the fleshlight.
2215000	2216000	My friend,
2216000	2218000	we worked at a video store that was
2218000	2221000	15% regular new release movies
2221000	2223000	and then the rest, porn.
2223000	2224000	Just porn and sex toys.
2224000	2226000	And he said there was one movie
2226000	2228000	that was consistently rented
2228000	2231000	as if he was going there for this movie
2231000	2233000	and then he would get a porn
2233000	2234000	just because it was there.
2234000	2236000	It's the Colgate toothpaste
2236000	2238000	of the pantyhose fetishist
2238000	2239000	at Elbertsons.
2239000	2240000	It's like,
2240000	2242000	toothpaste is right in the right spot.
2242000	2243000	I need some toothpaste
2243000	2244000	and some pantyhose.
2245000	2247000	And that toothpaste
2247000	2249000	was a league of their own.
2254000	2256000	I had to go to the market yesterday
2256000	2258000	because I was taping a hooze line
2258000	2259000	and I've learned that I sweat a lot
2259000	2260000	through my armpits
2260000	2261000	and I wear suits.
2261000	2262000	I don't want to sweat through them.
2262000	2263000	So I've learned from a wardrobe lady
2263000	2264000	that you put maxi pads
2264000	2265000	in your t-shirt
2265000	2267000	and little penny laners in there
2267000	2268000	and it works a charm.
2268000	2270000	Does it look like you have puffy pits though?
2270000	2272000	No, no, because they're little skinny guys
2272000	2273000	that go right...
2273000	2274000	You just stick them on
2274000	2275000	in the inside of your armpit
2275000	2276000	of your t-shirt
2276000	2277000	and you put them in there
2277000	2278000	and you're good to go.
2278000	2280000	It's like a wardrobe secret.
2280000	2281000	But it was the first time I walked up
2281000	2283000	and I forget what else I bought,
2283000	2284000	but it was a pretty funny...
2284000	2286000	I got some peanut butter cups.
2290000	2292000	Yeah, I get so much like...
2292000	2294000	I get more scotch tape.
2297000	2299000	You never just go in and say,
2299000	2300000	fuck it, I'm just going to go
2300000	2301000	pantyhose straight across the board
2301000	2302000	and you don't ever do a...
2302000	2303000	No.
2303000	2304000	Like a beard purchase on that?
2304000	2305000	No.
2305000	2306000	There was one time...
2306000	2308000	This is all pre-Amazon days.
2308000	2311000	So really, if you were going to be a creep
2311000	2312000	with a nylon fetish
2312000	2314000	and no girlfriend
2314000	2316000	and you were going to have...
2316000	2318000	and indulge yourself
2318000	2319000	with your mannequin leg,
2319000	2320000	you were...
2320000	2322000	You were, on some level,
2322000	2323000	you were going to have
2323000	2324000	a face-to-face encounter.
2324000	2327000	And I remember going into like a boutique
2328000	2329000	on like a...
2329000	2330000	what's...
2330000	2331000	Larchmont.
2331000	2332000	You know?
2332000	2333000	Like a fancy place.
2333000	2334000	Yeah, like a lingerie or something.
2334000	2335000	I was just like...
2335000	2337000	I got caught so off guard
2337000	2338000	that I was like...
2341000	2342000	I was like...
2342000	2343000	I was so used to like...
2351000	2353000	You know, Rob,
2353000	2355000	the plastics industry
2355000	2356000	ain't no sane either.
2358000	2360000	The carbon literal footprint
2360000	2361000	of what you're wearing right now.
2361000	2362000	Yeah.
2362000	2364000	You know they still use
2364000	2367000	cattle to drive the plastic mills.
2369000	2370000	Great.
2370000	2372000	Rob has plastic bags on his feet right now
2372000	2373000	for our homelessness.
2373000	2374000	Hey, don't tell...
2374000	2375000	For our homeless?
2375000	2376000	Just tell him to subscribe to the video feed.
2376000	2378000	For our homeless listeners.
2378000	2379000	For our homeless listeners.
2379000	2381000	Rob's having some beautiful
2381000	2383000	plastic bags on his feet.
2383000	2385000	And Jonah feels great about
2385000	2386000	having walked away from you.
2386000	2387000	Yeah.
2387000	2390000	Anyways, I walked into this boutique
2390000	2392000	and I was so used to like the more...
2392000	2394000	like the larger kind of Albertsons energy
2394000	2395000	where it was like,
2395000	2396000	okay, I'm going to walk around.
2396000	2397000	I'm going to browse.
2397000	2398000	I'm going to walk out of here
2398000	2400000	with a few sundries and notions.
2400000	2402000	And among them,
2402000	2404000	maybe perhaps a hosiery product.
2404000	2406000	Yeah, for the wife back home.
2406000	2407000	But I was like,
2407000	2408000	why?
2408000	2409000	But it's a tiny little store
2409000	2410000	and there were like three women
2410000	2411000	who were like really helpful.
2411000	2414000	And like I was like browsing this rack
2414000	2415000	of like...
2417000	2418000	And it was just...
2418000	2419000	It all happened so quickly.
2419000	2420000	I just walked in.
2420000	2422000	Where are you?
2423000	2425000	You're not allowed to...
2425000	2427000	That was also like the beginning of the story.
2427000	2429000	He's in a boutique on Larchmont for Pennyhose.
2429000	2430000	Yeah, I mean what?
2430000	2431000	Fine.
2431000	2432000	It's all you had to say.
2432000	2433000	It's all you had to say.
2433000	2434000	That's all you had to say.
2434000	2436000	Now I can be quiet and listen.
2436000	2438000	He said that while you were on the stage.
2438000	2440000	Presumably listening.
2440000	2441000	I wasn't listening.
2441000	2442000	And you came in with...
2442000	2444000	So you came in here like Gallagher
2444000	2446000	with shit on your feet like...
2446000	2448000	It's my favorite Gallagher bet.
2448000	2449000	I took it in stride.
2449000	2451000	I don't think I can hear
2451000	2452000	what you guys are saying about me
2452000	2453000	when I'm walking out there.
2453000	2455000	What the fuck are you asking questions?
2455000	2456000	You guys are walking out...
2456000	2458000	I'm walking out there
2458000	2459000	and I'm going to the bathroom
2459000	2460000	and he said he'd go
2460000	2462000	and he's going to get pee on his foot.
2462000	2464000	Like I'm a fucking joke.
2464000	2466000	Like I'm a piece of shit to you.
2466000	2468000	Nobody can hear anything when you walk
2468000	2470000	with plastic bags on your feet.
2470000	2472000	You make me feel like a fucking jackass
2472000	2473000	all the time.
2473000	2475000	I feel like a piece of shit.
2475000	2477000	Piss all over me.
2478000	2480000	Thanks for having me on.
2484000	2485000	Anyways, I...
2485000	2487000	You make me look like a jerk.
2490000	2492000	In front of my wife, dog.
2496000	2497000	So these three ladies come over
2497000	2498000	and they're trying to help you out.
2498000	2499000	They're just like immediately like,
2499000	2500000	like, can I help you?
2500000	2502000	And I was like standing by the pantyhose
2502000	2503000	when they asked that
2503000	2505000	and I was like, no, I'm just looking
2505000	2507000	and they're like, at pantyhose?
2507000	2509000	And I was like, yeah.
2509000	2510000	And they're like, for your girlfriend.
2510000	2512000	And I'm like, yep.
2512000	2514000	And it just kept on from there until...
2514000	2517000	I had to make this whole fictional girlfriend
2517000	2519000	and like, I was like shopping for like,
2519000	2521000	why am I buying her pantyhose
2521000	2522000	and how tall is she?
2522000	2524000	And it was a whole thing.
2524000	2526000	It's not like a hugely entertaining story
2526000	2527000	dialogue line.
2527000	2529000	Oh, I'm sorry I interrupted then.
2535000	2536000	You take notes?
2536000	2537000	I think so.
2546000	2548000	So anyways, Jonah,
2548000	2550000	we are label mates
2550000	2552000	in this new venture called CISO.
2552000	2553000	CISO!
2553000	2554000	CISO!
2554000	2555000	Hey, Pew.
2555000	2557000	I have a couple of questions.
2559000	2560000	You have CISO questions?
2560000	2562000	Why is it called CISO
2562000	2564000	when there's only one ring in it?
2564000	2566000	If you see something, say something.
2566000	2567000	Say something?
2567000	2568000	Isn't it?
2568000	2569000	See so you get it.
2569000	2572000	If you see something, say something.
2572000	2573000	No one knows why.
2573000	2574000	Do you know why?
2574000	2576000	He says like, if you don't believe
2576000	2578000	that you can get good comedy
2578000	2581000	for $4.99 a month.
2581000	2582000	See.
2582000	2584000	So you get it.
2584000	2586000	I mean, it's not good, but that's what it is.
2586000	2587000	Is that it?
2587000	2588000	That's what it is, yeah.
2588000	2589000	CISO for yourself?
2589000	2590000	I think that, well, I'll tell you.
2590000	2591000	I have the answer to your question.
2591000	2593000	But I think the bottom line is probably
2593000	2596000	that as with, that the goal is always to
2596000	2598000	come up with gibberish because
2598000	2600000	that's all that's left available.
2600000	2602000	And it has to be gibberish that
2602000	2604000	when you hear it, you know how to spell it.
2604000	2607000	But I think the logic behind the etymology,
2607000	2608000	as it's been told to me,
2608000	2609000	is that you see something,
2609000	2611000	so you tell someone.
2611000	2614000	It's summarizing the primal experience
2614000	2616000	of word-of-mouth advertising.
2616000	2617000	Wow.
2617000	2618000	CISO.
2618000	2620000	I see Monty Python archives,
2620000	2624000	so I'm telling Jonah Ray, you go to CISO.
2624000	2626000	But I'm already there.
2626000	2627000	Yeah, that's true.
2627000	2629000	Jonah, when does your show drop?
2629000	2632000	I think June, I think.
2632000	2633000	When does yours go?
2633000	2635000	Spring of 2000.
2635000	2638000	Jeff's in an episode of my show.
2638000	2639000	What's it called again?
2639000	2640000	Hidden America.
2640000	2641000	Hidden America with Jonah Ray.
2641000	2642000	Yeah.
2642000	2643000	Yeah, I got to be in one of them.
2643000	2644000	Yeah, to be in an episode.
2644000	2645000	The boss back there.
2645000	2646000	Do you think it's good?
2646000	2648000	My show?
2648000	2650000	I don't like anything I do.
2650000	2652000	I like one thing I've done.
2652000	2655000	HarmonQuest, coming soon to CISO.
2655000	2656000	When does that come out?
2656000	2657000	Spring of 2016.
2657000	2658000	Do you like it?
2658000	2659000	It's really good.
2659000	2660000	I really love it.
2660000	2661000	I like mine too.
2661000	2662000	I like mine too then.
2662000	2663000	Okay.
2663000	2664000	I don't know.
2664000	2665000	I don't know how to.
2665000	2667000	I don't like ego and bravado,
2667000	2669000	so to say I like something I did
2669000	2670000	feels a bit too forward.
2670000	2672000	Unless you make something amazing.
2672000	2673000	That's true.
2673000	2675000	Then you're just being humble by going,
2675000	2677000	whoa, I made that.
2677000	2678000	Do you do that often?
2678000	2679000	No, just with HarmonQuest.
2679000	2682000	Coming soon to CISO.
2682000	2686000	Community seasons one through six all sucked.
2686000	2690000	Rick and Morty can suck my balls.
2690000	2692000	HarmonQuest is the one thing I'm proud of.
2692000	2694000	Wow.
2694000	2695000	That's great.
2695000	2698000	So if that interests you, tune in.
2698000	2699000	That does.
2699000	2700000	Because all these people are going,
2700000	2701000	I love those things.
2701000	2703000	The guy who made it thinks they suck.
2703000	2705000	This HarmonQuest is going to be the best.
2705000	2708000	It's a little misguided.
2708000	2714000	It was remarkable the extent to which,
2714000	2716000	seeing that whole thing come together.
2716000	2719000	When I was watching the Ricky Gervais show on HBO,
2719000	2724000	I fucking love it when people are saying shit in audio
2724000	2727000	off the cuff and then animators are illustrating it
2727000	2730000	in the exact, it is the thing that makes me laugh
2730000	2732000	until I cry all the time.
2732000	2736000	If the guy is Carl Pilkington and the artist are,
2736000	2738000	those artists, you strive for that.
2738000	2741000	You can make me laugh until I cry in that format.
2741000	2743000	So I was like, yeah, there's got to be a way,
2743000	2745000	like the D&D thing to do that.
2745000	2747000	And that's been years and years in the making
2747000	2749000	and seeing it actually come together now.
2749000	2752000	I hear all your friends are a part of it.
2752000	2754000	Yep.
2754000	2759000	Just the funny ones.
2759000	2760000	That's cool.
2760000	2763000	That's cool that you got them all together.
2763000	2764000	Yeah.
2764000	2766000	Must have been hard because they're so busy.
2766000	2769000	But you don't like games, famously.
2769000	2771000	Oh, yeah, that's right.
2771000	2773000	Oh, you hate playing games.
2773000	2775000	Aw.
2775000	2777000	Oh, shit.
2777000	2779000	Oh, wow.
2779000	2780000	Yeah.
2780000	2788000	I hate seeing you eat crow by your own petard.
2788000	2790000	That's a real saying.
2790000	2794000	That crow hoist Captain Petard up high enough.
2794000	2798000	You fucking petard.
2798000	2801000	Not a big laugh on that one.
2801000	2802000	You were almost there.
2802000	2804000	I think you almost have that one.
2804000	2805000	Anyways.
2805000	2808000	You kind of did that, though, on, there's two episodes
2808000	2810000	of Rick and Morty that are kind of like that
2810000	2813000	with improvised dialogue and then the animated section.
2813000	2814000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2814000	2817000	Justin was doing that on House of Cosby's,
2817000	2820000	like the whole interdimensional cable thing.
2820000	2823000	Yeah, Justin goes in the booth and makes crazy shit up
2823000	2825000	and then the animators draw.
2825000	2826000	Yeah.
2826000	2827000	It's pretty great.
2827000	2829000	You know, I think it's a good time for House of Cosby
2829000	2831000	to just be put up on YouTube.
2831000	2834000	It's like, money-wise, I'm sure he's spread a bit thin.
2834000	2835000	Yeah.
2835000	2837000	I have a feeling he's not going to come after us.
2837000	2842000	His legal department has a lot of thumbs and a lot of pies right now.
2842000	2843000	Yeah, yeah.
2843000	2844000	Put in pies.
2844000	2847000	To go back in fucking time when we were getting those
2847000	2850000	cease and desist letters for a fucking cease and desist letter.
2850000	2851000	Why do they call it that?
2851000	2854000	I love to just write a letter back to the lawyer
2854000	2855000	sending the cease and desist and go,
2855000	2862000	I think we both know that you have bigger fish to fry.
2862000	2866000	I think we both know you have 47 fish to fry.
2866000	2867000	Oh, my God.
2867000	2869000	If only God.
2869000	2872000	I now think that is the way I would use time travel
2872000	2874000	if I stumbled onto it.
2874000	2877000	There'd be portals open.
2877000	2880000	I could push Hitler in the shower.
2880000	2882000	I could make him break his neck.
2882000	2887000	I can't riff a bunch of examples of benevolent ways to use time travel.
2887000	2889000	Just riff your own later with your own room.
2889000	2892000	And then there's just, I'm going to shame Bill Cosby
2892000	2895000	for his crime against me.
2896000	2899000	Humanity.
2899000	2905000	Because that's the thing he did that really gets my fucking dander up.
2905000	2908000	Yeah.
2908000	2910000	I just went back and watched all the House of Cosby's.
2910000	2911000	They're pretty funny.
2911000	2913000	They're great.
2913000	2914000	Yeah.
2914000	2915000	Yeah, yeah.
2915000	2916000	They were real good.
2916000	2918000	You were in those, Rob.
2918000	2920000	I was in a couple.
2920000	2922000	Rob, you were a big Bill Cosby fan.
2922000	2930000	We haven't really talked about the impact that these allegations have had on you.
2930000	2935000	I'm bummed out about it as much as anybody that was inspired by him.
2935000	2939000	Do you think it will forever color if you go back and listen to his records?
2939000	2941000	Yeah, absolutely.
2941000	2942000	I mean, how couldn't it?
2942000	2943000	Exactly.
2943000	2945000	Yeah, because why is a trip to the dentist that funny now?
2945000	2947000	Yeah, yeah.
2947000	2954000	He's now more known for rape than being funny.
2954000	2957000	So yeah, try to get that out of your head.
2957000	2958000	It's not easy.
2958000	2962000	So you can't separate the art from the artist?
2962000	2967000	I'm sorry, I thought you were doing a bit.
2967000	2970000	I was just trying to think of a real pretentious thing to say in the light of...
2970000	2975000	You can't separate the rape from the rapist.
2976000	2982000	If you listen to, as I do, I'll flip in channels of my car on the satellite XM Sirius radio.
2982000	2984000	Ooh.
2984000	2985000	Oh yeah.
2985000	2987000	I drive a car, Jonah.
2987000	2989000	I don't know.
2989000	2992000	My car only goes terrestrial.
2992000	2995000	Tell me about your space car, Jeff.
2995000	3000000	Well, it goes up to like 100 miles an hour.
3000000	3003000	There's like four or five comedy channels.
3003000	3006000	And once in a while, Rob is redecorating right now.
3006000	3008000	No, no, this is what I do.
3008000	3009000	Are you going to flash?
3009000	3010000	Are you going to sit like AC Slater?
3010000	3011000	No.
3011000	3012000	I'm just going to rap with this.
3012000	3013000	Are you about to break it down for real?
3013000	3015000	No, no.
3015000	3017000	Are you about to give me counseling advice for not an eighth grade?
3017000	3018000	No, no.
3018000	3021000	You guys did literally all of these bits the last time.
3021000	3023000	I turned my chair around.
3023000	3024000	Guys, don't overreact.
3024000	3032000	He only stood up on a stage where there's only four things to look at and one of them is you.
3033000	3036000	Yeah, everyone's overreacting.
3036000	3039000	We're all a bunch of mental fucking midges.
3039000	3045000	You guys are all acting like you don't always see a guy in pajamas with plastic bags on his feet.
3045000	3049000	Get up and do arbitrary set designs.
3049000	3051000	Guys, take it easy.
3051000	3053000	Teacher's trying to tell us.
3053000	3061000	Let's have Rob talk about the importance of veganism for three minutes.
3061000	3062000	Three minutes?
3062000	3068000	Well, the three of us do normal things that you'd be an asshole for being distracted by.
3068000	3070000	Nobody's an asshole.
3070000	3076000	I felt like I was slouching too much and I thought that was taking focus.
3079000	3082000	Sorry, I was dreaming I was on a bicycle.
3082000	3084000	It happens.
3084000	3087000	What's the biggie dooey?
3087000	3089000	What's the biggie dooey?
3089000	3092000	I coined it and you're all going to be saying it tomorrow.
3092000	3094000	Hey, everybody, it's Dan Harmon.
3094000	3095000	What's the biggie dooey?
3095000	3097000	What's the biggie dooey?
3097000	3099000	We'll be right back.
3104000	3112000	I'm an adorable 43-year-old fat white man adopted by aliens and I just keep going.
3112000	3114000	What's the biggie dooey?
3114000	3117000	Dan, we got to send you back to where you were actually from.
3117000	3120000	You don't know their cultures, but we're just going to let you figure it out.
3120000	3124000	What's the biggie dooey?
3124000	3128000	Good, start with that.
3128000	3132000	Sorry, we're doing two different things.
3132000	3137000	All right, yeah, so CISO, HarmonQuest, Rob is...
3137000	3142000	I was saying XM Radio, you were flipping through the channel and once in a while you will still hear them play a clip from Cosby.
3142000	3150000	I don't know if that's them being provocative or maybe that's just old programming stuff they forgot to expunge.
3150000	3152000	That's a weird...
3152000	3154000	It's an interesting...
3154000	3156000	I don't know what he was being called.
3156000	3160000	Right after the first allegations started coming out, like after the Hannibal Burris stuff
3160000	3166000	and all the first wave of the women coming out saying that they had been assaulted by him,
3166000	3170000	they would play and they would talk about it, the Spanish fly bit.
3170000	3172000	That's the first thing I thought of.
3172000	3175000	I just heard that a few weeks ago.
3175000	3179000	But this stuff has been around 10 years prior to Hannibal.
3179000	3181000	They were doing bits about it.
3181000	3185000	Well, that was the big outrage was that there was a conspiracy of that there's a...
3185000	3188000	Yeah, I thought that was a very insightful observation.
3188000	3190000	I heard about it. I was bummed out about it.
3190000	3192000	Bobcat joked around about it.
3192000	3194000	People talked about it.
3195000	3197000	You would hear things about it.
3197000	3201000	And then I thought that was an astute observation.
3201000	3203000	Well, the crowd laughs when Hannibal Burris says it.
3203000	3205000	The crowd laughs with recognition.
3205000	3207000	They laugh because it's something that people have already...
3207000	3209000	It's already been in the ether a bit.
3209000	3213000	And then for some weird fascinating reason about our national psyche,
3213000	3217000	because he is a young black man and a comic,
3217000	3220000	that has something to do with it, right?
3220000	3221000	Am I crazy?
3221000	3225000	That was the sort of like the think pieces that were written about it.
3225000	3231000	It was like, oh, Hannibal Burris had to say something before people started dogpiling.
3231000	3235000	Well, he had recorded that set long before it was ever released.
3235000	3240000	It was in Philly, which is why he brought it up, because that's where Cosby was from.
3240000	3244000	I think it just happened to be maybe a slow news day that some guy was like,
3244000	3248000	I'm going to post this, make an article about it, and then it blew up.
3248000	3250000	And for rightfully so, and it's great for what happened,
3250000	3252000	and people getting recognition from it,
3252000	3258000	but I think it was just a happenstance that some guy at HuffPo decided to write an article about it.
3258000	3261000	HuffPo.
3261000	3266000	I get all my hip news from the HuffPo.
3266000	3268000	What's the dealio?
3268000	3270000	I don't have time to say...
3270000	3271000	Open up.
3271000	3275000	Let me right-click on that HuffPo.
3275000	3278000	What's the weather today, HuffPo?
3278000	3284000	Oh, it's Obama 65 with a windshield.
3284000	3286000	Professor Strong, can you please just teach us?
3286000	3288000	Oh, my gosh.
3288000	3294000	Hey, HuffPo, what are some of the funny cartoons I can look at?
3294000	3295000	HuffPo.
3295000	3296000	Oh, really?
3296000	3298000	HuffPo, Wheeljack, Silver Streak.
3298000	3303000	The Decepticons are attacking.
3303000	3305000	HuffPo.
3305000	3306000	HuffPo.
3306000	3314000	You know, back in my day, it was called the Huffington Po.
3314000	3316000	What about Grandpappy's Day?
3316000	3322000	Grandpappy's Day, it was the Huffington Post Office.
3322000	3323000	Oh.
3323000	3324000	Oh, yeah.
3324000	3326000	They had all the time in the world back then.
3326000	3331000	Yeah, you didn't know back in his day that it was the Huffington Post Office.
3331000	3333000	What did the cavemen call it?
3333000	3334000	Did they go back then?
3334000	3338000	They called it, the cavemen called it.
3338000	3348000	Back in their day, they called it the Huffington Post Office Choir.
3348000	3349000	Choir?
3349000	3350000	Choir.
3350000	3353000	Oh, it was just pre-linguistic gibberish.
3353000	3354000	Yeah.
3354000	3355000	It was like primal drench.
3355000	3360000	Well, they didn't have the margin set, so the rest of the title went right off of the...
3360000	3365000	What you're hearing during that word is someone seeing a dinosaur and running.
3365000	3366000	Yeah.
3366000	3370000	I'll finish this later.
3370000	3376000	There's things you call shit, and then there's running from a dinosaur.
3376000	3383000	Dinosaurs and men existed at the same time, but not women.
3383000	3387000	That's my very controversial point of view.
3387000	3389000	I believe in the Big Bang.
3389000	3392000	I believe the universe is six trillion years old.
3392000	3397000	I don't cotton to all that bullshit, like these fucking evangelical people, but I believe
3397000	3400000	that man and dinosaur lived at the same time.
3400000	3405000	Does that mean that women are a descendant of man fucking a dinosaur?
3405000	3408000	No, women so hot.
3408000	3409000	Damn.
3409000	3411000	Yes, yes, yes, yes.
3411000	3412000	Okay, yeah.
3412000	3415000	You guys know that there's like dino porn.
3415000	3416000	Yeah, okay.
3416000	3417000	They do know.
3417000	3419000	I would say it's so matter of factly, I don't know.
3419000	3421000	Yeah, but did you hear that fucking yeah?
3421000	3422000	Yeah, yeah.
3422000	3425000	That's my crowd.
3425000	3426000	Yeah.
3426000	3430000	Yeah, there's like a series of books.
3430000	3435000	They're sort of like self-starters turned like huge popular things.
3435000	3438000	They're fiction.
3438000	3441000	It's women being kind of ravished by dinosaurs.
3441000	3444000	Do the dinosaurs have feathers?
3444000	3446000	You have every question that I have.
3446000	3450000	As far as we got was like pulling up some of the covers online and then like, yeah,
3450000	3455000	I guess it's like just sort of a, it's something that's like a generated out of fan fiction
3455000	3457000	and then became like genre.
3457000	3461000	Is it CG dinosaurs like slash, like these are dinosaurs fucking?
3461000	3463000	Well, yeah, it's but CG.
3463000	3465000	Oh, people, well, it's live action.
3465000	3466000	No, it's fiction.
3466000	3467000	It's just literature.
3467000	3468000	Oh, literature.
3468000	3471000	I'm saying it's like stories about, we skimmed through.
3472000	3480000	There'll be like stories about like a dinosaur and then it's sexualizing dinosaurs.
3480000	3482000	Miss, are you looking it up right now?
3482000	3484000	Are you looking it up?
3484000	3487000	Wait, so are dinosaurs like just forcing themselves?
3487000	3488000	That's what we don't know.
3488000	3492000	Justin heard about it and then he drew on the whiteboard this amazing picture of like
3492000	3496000	a T-Rex with a big heart on it and then a woman kind of perched on it like sort of like
3496000	3497000	rubbing his nipples.
3497000	3500000	A rape tour?
3500000	3503000	It could have been consensual.
3503000	3508000	But I think it's sort of like, because that was my first question is are they raptor size
3508000	3510000	because that's, who cares?
3512000	3517000	Well, raptors are like, you know, they're regular size so that's like, well, let's see.
3517000	3519000	Where's the imagination?
3519000	3522000	Where's the sense of whimsy?
3522000	3524000	I can get into that though.
3524000	3530000	Don't, don't, don't put me, confine me in such a raptor shaped box.
3530000	3533000	Let's get some stegosaurus there.
3533000	3539000	There is such a thing as beastiality and we have beasts on this earth that raptors are
3539000	3540000	the same size as.
3540000	3543000	I think it's very interesting because I've never heard of that, like the idea that you
3543000	3549000	could sexualize such a giant prehistoric lizard that it's like, I wanted to be very clear
3549000	3550000	on that.
3550000	3553000	Are we talking about Godzilla size like fucking things and then how do they sexualize them?
3553000	3554000	I don't know.
3554000	3555000	I didn't read.
3555000	3556000	It's 9-11.
3556000	3557000	It's 9-11.
3557000	3563000	You're saying it's dino, like it's reptile on women action or organo?
3563000	3565000	Does anybody know more about this?
3565000	3566000	She's got, she did.
3566000	3567000	Bro.
3567000	3568000	Yeah, but we, she shot her hand.
3568000	3571000	But the fastest hand that I've ever seen raised happened.
3571000	3573000	Get up here and read us from dino porn.
3573000	3574000	What'd you matter?
3574000	3575000	Okay.
3575000	3576000	What is your name?
3576000	3579000	She's the same one who put the booze in the movie.
3579000	3582000	Please be America's foremost author of dino porn.
3582000	3590400	No, he actually has a name and he's on, yeah, he's on amazon.com, many a book.
3590400	3592000	I don't remember his name though.
3592000	3593000	Well, now I don't like it.
3593000	3594000	It's like Chris.
3594000	3595000	It's Chris DeSoutz.
3595000	3598000	I thought it was a woman.
3598000	3599000	No.
3599000	3600000	And I was like, Danielle Steele.
3600000	3601000	There's a couple different ones.
3601000	3609680	He had an excellent Reddit AMA one time and he likes to put businessmen in suits, fucking
3609680	3616680	dinosaurs or dinosaurs in suits, fucking, I can't get into the reality anymore.
3616680	3618680	Now I'm turned on.
3618680	3619680	Now you got a fan.
3619680	3620680	I'm turned on by dinosaurs.
3620680	3621680	So the dinosaurs.
3621680	3622680	Yeah.
3622680	3624680	I'll fucking dinosaur in a suit.
3624680	3625680	I'm sorry.
3625680	3627760	What's your, what's your name, young lady?
3627760	3628760	My name's Molly.
3628760	3629760	Molly.
3629760	3632680	So these are man sized dinosaurs.
3632680	3639400	No, they might be dinosaurs and dinosaurs shaped size.
3639400	3640400	But there's also...
3640400	3641400	Wait, wait, wait.
3641400	3642400	Does they have...
3642400	3643400	I'm saying, does it...
3643400	3644400	Wait, say that.
3644400	3645400	I didn't get that.
3645400	3646400	No, I didn't get it.
3646400	3647400	This is the stage of the show where I'm getting a little drunk.
3647400	3648400	I didn't get it.
3648400	3649400	I'm getting a little drunk.
3649400	3650400	Betrayed this scale very well.
3650400	3651400	Me too.
3651400	3654560	So, yeah, they're like dinosaur sized, like big ones, big ones.
3654560	3657760	The dinosaurs range in size.
3657760	3661840	Is there ever a story where Wayne Knight fucks a spitter?
3661840	3664840	I don't...
3664840	3665840	Don't encourage him.
3665840	3667160	I do not know what that is.
3667920	3669920	I think we know how it ends.
3669920	3672920	Good thing mostly everyone else does.
3672920	3679920	You know, I have a bumper sticker that says, good delafasauruses don't spit.
3679920	3680920	Anyways.
3680920	3681920	No, please.
3681920	3682920	Delafasaurus.
3682920	3683920	Molly.
3683920	3688920	My favorite is dinosaurs fucking cars.
3688920	3689920	What?
3689920	3690920	Okay.
3690920	3691920	Yes.
3691920	3692920	Are the cars like Pixar cars?
3692920	3693920	Like, they're like, ow.
3693920	3694920	No.
3694920	3695920	Okay.
3695920	3700040	They're like straight up like mechanical cars with no faces, not humanized at all.
3700040	3701040	Just like giant...
3701040	3702040	What are they putting?
3702040	3704800	Are they putting a dick like in the muffler or in the trunk, I guess?
3704800	3705800	Oh, no.
3705800	3706800	Sorry.
3706800	3707800	I got it wrong.
3707800	3708800	It's not dinosaurs.
3708800	3709800	It's dragons.
3709800	3710800	Dragons with wings.
3710800	3711800	Dragons with fucking cars.
3711800	3712800	Yes.
3712800	3713800	Okay.
3713800	3714800	What the fuck?
3714800	3715800	Go back.
3715800	3716800	Dragons?
3716800	3717800	It's a whole subreddit.
3717800	3718800	It's a whole subreddit.
3718800	3719800	Dragons fucking cars.
3719800	3720800	Now, is this just people having fun or is not people jerking off actively?
3720800	3721800	All right.
3721800	3722800	That sounds like a right wing policy.
3722800	3723800	All right.
3723800	3724800	That's the question.
3725680	3726680	I'm out.
3726680	3727680	I'm out.
3727680	3728680	All right.
3728680	3729680	Everybody...
3729680	3730680	Can I have my tequila back?
3730680	3731680	Yeah.
3731680	3732680	Yeah.
3732680	3733680	All right.
3733680	3734680	Now, we know.
3734680	3737520	Let me get a little Donahue control here.
3737520	3743680	Donahue was a guy who hosted a talk show before Geraldo.
3743680	3745680	What?
3745680	3747680	Okay.
3747680	3749680	So Molly...
3749680	3751920	Yes, Dan?
3751920	3760200	You mentioned in passing some of these stories are dinosaur-sized dinosaurs sexualized in
3760200	3763280	situations with regular-sized women, right?
3763280	3764280	I really...
3764280	3767800	I just need to remember the name of this guy and then we'll have a million excellent titles
3767800	3768800	to draw from.
3768800	3769800	Chuck Tingle.
3769800	3770800	Chuck Tingle.
3770800	3771800	Chuck Tingle.
3771800	3772800	Chuck Tingle.
3772800	3773800	It's Chuck Tingle.
3773800	3779800	So does Chuck Tingle write human-sized dinosaurs but dinosaur-sized humans?
3780800	3781800	Okay.
3781800	3786280	So there's definitely an excellent title that something has to do with his butt fucking
3786280	3787280	his own butt.
3787280	3788280	Wait.
3788280	3789280	What?
3789280	3790280	Oh, yeah.
3790280	3792280	His own butt fucking his own butt?
3792280	3794280	That's like where his ass fucks him, right?
3794280	3798640	It's nice work if you can get it.
3798640	3799640	His...
3799640	3800640	What's that?
3800640	3804480	Chuck Tingle wrote a story about his own butt fucking his own butt.
3804480	3805480	Yeah.
3805480	3807480	Like his butt shows up and it's like, oh.
3807480	3808480	Is he a genius?
3808480	3809480	Yeah.
3810160	3811160	Yes.
3811160	3812160	He literally is a genius.
3812160	3814320	If butts start learning how to fuck...
3814320	3818040	If butts start learning how to fuck themselves, we're all out of a fucking job.
3818040	3819040	Life finds a way.
3819040	3820040	I know.
3820040	3821760	You and me and every dinosaur we know.
3821760	3827520	So the first title that comes up is, My Ass is Haunted by the Gay Unicorn Colonel.
3827520	3828520	Too long.
3828520	3829520	His name is Colonel?
3829520	3831520	Colonel, like with the O's in it.
3831520	3832520	Colonel.
3832520	3833520	Okay.
3833520	3834520	Colonel.
3834520	3835520	All right.
3835520	3836520	So a lot of these people...
3836520	3837520	Okay.
3837520	3838520	Here.
3838560	3839560	Okay.
3839560	3842160	Wait, is that like one of a series of space raptors?
3842160	3843160	Oh, oh.
3843160	3844160	Well, that's like the third one.
3844160	3846000	Space Raptor 3, butt invasion.
3846000	3851320	Space Raptor in the hood.
3851320	3853320	They did three of those.
3853320	3854320	Yeah, yeah.
3854320	3857280	Space Raptor out west.
3857280	3861720	They did one space raptor in space and three in the hood.
3861720	3866760	Okay, so here's the one I was thinking of.
3866760	3869560	Pounded in the butt by my own butt.
3869560	3870560	Okay.
3870560	3873200	This sounds like one of my raps.
3873200	3874200	Yeah.
3874200	3879040	Can we put out the Harmon Town Bat Signal and get Chuck Tingle on the show?
3879040	3880040	I've read that, that story.
3880040	3881040	I think he would come.
3881040	3882040	That's good.
3882040	3887320	Well, I just don't want to fall into like a thing like, if this is like a piranha movie
3887320	3890320	thing where it's like, I don't want this guy to be in on the joke.
3890320	3891320	I want him to be gassed in on...
3891320	3893320	That's what it looks like though, from that artwork, right?
3893320	3894320	He's hard.
3894320	3895320	He loves it.
3895320	3896320	But we don't know that he makes his own artwork.
3896320	3899600	I think the story is about him being so surprised that it's actually his own butt.
3899600	3900600	How do you know?
3900600	3901600	I've read it.
3901600	3902600	He's called Chuck Tingle though?
3902600	3903600	Is this the guy?
3903600	3904600	Is this the model?
3904600	3909600	I think this guy's too ripped and handsome to be Chuck Tingle.
3909600	3910600	No, that's not Chuck Tingle.
3910600	3912320	I think we're fighting at Spencer as Chuck Tingle.
3912320	3913320	Don't roll your eyes.
3913320	3914320	Don't roll your eyes.
3914320	3916880	Of course I roll my eyes.
3916880	3920280	He's holding up the cover of my butt, pounded my own butt.
3920280	3921680	It's like clearly a guy...
3921680	3924240	My is on the title twice.
3924240	3925920	You don't think he would put himself on the cover?
3926720	3932520	When you walk past a Harlequin novel, do you think that Angela Harlequin is the woman
3932520	3933520	on the cover?
3933520	3934520	She's not!
3934520	3937520	Is she not?
3937520	3942720	I really did think it and I feel dumb now, thanks.
3942720	3946520	You thought Harlequin was just some lady who's always good to go?
3946520	3949720	I thought that might have been him.
3949720	3950720	Alright.
3950720	3952520	Well, yeah, I wanted to...
3952520	3953520	Here's the thing.
3953520	3957360	I wanted to set it up because maybe it's the self-loathing male in me.
3957360	3966240	I thought it was like a new culture among women who were like, I want to do it with
3966240	3967240	a dinosaur.
3967240	3968240	And they were expressing themselves.
3968240	3972400	I didn't know it was some anonymous guy who's like, and then the dinosaur fucks the lady
3972400	3974400	and everyone's like, yay.
3974400	3976520	So you thought the authors were female?
3976520	3983440	I thought it was like a phenomenon, like one of many new blossoming like things that
3983440	3988160	couldn't have been possible if the internet hadn't existed, that people can find each
3988160	3994320	other and then find their audience so that rule 34 meets the human psyche and like people
3994320	3995960	going like, yeah, you know what?
3995960	3999520	I have this one thing that I'm really, really, really obsessed with and I'm really, really
3999520	4000520	passionate about it.
4000520	4002640	And then everyone going, yes, yes, yes.
4002640	4004200	I like that too.
4004200	4008840	There's only 500 of us, but I'll give you $30 for a t-shirt.
4008840	4010200	That's what I love about the internet.
4010200	4013960	I thought it was like there was this thing that was like this biosphere where it was
4013960	4020200	like, did you know that women like certain small subset of a subset of a subset of women
4020200	4027720	like when they look at a T-Rex, they like, they get a little bit tingly and that some
4027720	4032880	of them are like really good writers and that people are like flooding to their work and
4032880	4034920	going like, this is amazing.
4034920	4035920	That's all right.
4035920	4039760	But isn't it possible that he's writing for like his stuff lands on the people?
4039760	4040760	Maybe he's really good.
4040760	4041760	Yeah.
4041760	4042760	I'm not, I'm not judging the guy.
4042760	4045040	I don't know anything about this person.
4045040	4049320	I'm not saying, I'm just saying like the mythology I created in my head is disappointed.
4049320	4052400	It's like I, you're disappointed in dinosaur porn.
4052400	4053400	No.
4053400	4057960	So it matters a lot to him whether or not people actually get off on it or not.
4057960	4058960	Right.
4058960	4059960	Yeah.
4059960	4063360	And it doesn't really matter.
4063360	4064840	We can just laugh at it too.
4064840	4065840	Yeah.
4065840	4068880	I mean, I guess I have, I have a relationship now where it's like, we open up the laptop,
4068880	4071800	we watch the porn, the acting's bad.
4071800	4073320	Like we can, we can search for jokes.
4073320	4074320	We can search for whatever.
4074320	4075320	We laugh.
4075320	4076320	Then all of a sudden someone's jerking off.
4076320	4077320	Then we're fucking whatever.
4077320	4080380	Like, like, it's like, like, I guess that's fine.
4080380	4084320	But the, the piranha movie thing, I just don't want to be part of someone else's joke.
4084320	4085320	Yeah.
4085320	4090120	No, no, I get that once when someone's in on the joke, it makes it passionate.
4090120	4091120	But your shit.
4091120	4092120	Yeah.
4092120	4098680	Don't laugh with me when I'm laughing at your thing, you fucking stay out of my joy
4099680	4100680	making fun of you.
4100680	4101680	Yeah.
4101680	4105580	Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't repackage the room as a comedy, Tommy
4105580	4106580	Wiseau.
4106580	4107580	Yeah.
4107580	4112120	Fucking stand your ground and say, this is the Citizen Kane of movies about a guy with
4112120	4119200	Cronin Berge, like burn scars on his back, doing a sex scene with a woman in a fucking
4119200	4124320	crazy ass, like psychological experiment that involves taping two cameras together.
4124320	4125320	That is weird though.
4125320	4128500	When you see the movie, it's a, everyone saw the room and Tommy Wiseau shows up and he's
4128500	4130580	very, he's very plain about how much he loves it.
4130580	4132500	But it has anyone ever seen and I'm sure you've seen it.
4132500	4133500	I think you say his pilot.
4133500	4134500	No, get event.
4134500	4135500	Have you guys seen get event?
4135500	4136500	Oh yeah.
4136500	4137500	I've seen get event.
4137500	4141780	Get event is a movie called get even, but in the title shot, the words are too close
4141780	4142780	together.
4142780	4147100	It's so everyone just calls the movie get a, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a, it's a, it's a,
4147100	4148860	he's a Tommy Wiseau type.
4148860	4151100	He's a self-made like movie star.
4151100	4152100	He made his own.
4152100	4154260	He looked like Dr. Phil kind of, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4154260	4156700	And he made, he made a movie about, he's a lawyer.
4156700	4162660	He's a lawyer in Los Angeles and so he funded and wrote and directed and starred and also
4162660	4165780	did it and sang in his own movie.
4165780	4170860	And but like we, we, me and Deanna saw it at Cine family and he showed up and everyone's
4170860	4172420	like, it's like, what do you think he's going to be like now?
4172420	4173580	When did you see that?
4173580	4175780	Um, maybe two years ago.
4175780	4176780	Yeah.
4176780	4177780	You were there, right?
4177780	4178780	Oh yeah.
4178780	4183500	That was after, um, wasn't that after my birthday?
4183500	4184860	Your birthday was right before it.
4184860	4185860	Yeah.
4186020	4190700	And do you remember he showed up and he was wearing a windbreaker suit, a two piece windbreaker
4190700	4197580	suit and brought in his own igloo cooler full of, uh, natural light.
4197580	4200740	And then when everyone asked about the movie, they're like, it's like, so tell us about,
4200740	4201740	uh, how you made the movie.
4201740	4207260	He's like, well, you know, I want, I set out to make, uh, the best action movie ever.
4207260	4213660	And I think we got pretty close and then everyone, it's like you've, you've heard a room full
4213660	4214660	of people laughing.
4214780	4218380	But you've never heard of a room of people trying not to laugh.
4220380	4223140	So really, I mean, that's, that's an interesting new phenomenon too.
4223140	4226540	Like, uh, like everybody goes, see, uh, what was it worst worst?
4226540	4226940	What's it called?
4226940	4231820	Worst, worst, worst, best movie because it examines that, that, that phenomenon really
4231820	4236060	closely because the movie troll two is like this like insanely horrible movie.
4236060	4239500	And there's like these actors in it and like, it's, it is interesting.
4239500	4243540	This thing that we do, we're like, like we celebrate, we go like, this fucking
4243540	4244220	movie is the best.
4244260	4246300	I'm so into this movie because it's so horrible.
4246300	4251260	And then like, we're like, like what we are definitions of like, uh, when you're being
4251260	4252940	mean by doing that.

4264700	4270060	or a topic in the news right now, or a personal thing for you, or I'll make it all
4270060	4273180	better with a rap or I'll address it at least I'll get to the bottom of it.
4273620	4273980	Okay.
4273980	4275180	I have an answer for you.
4275860	4279700	Uh, I work with dogs in a city.
4281740	4285740	I work in a dog with dogs in a city and you people who live in cities, stop getting
4285740	4290740	dogs, please, because those poor dogs just live inside all day and you go to work and
4290740	4292140	you leave them alone and they're bored.
4292180	4293060	You're mean.
4293140	4293540	Yeah.
4293540	4294300	Stop doing that.
4294340	4295420	I take my dog to work.
4295940	4296740	Well, that's nice.
4296940	4297180	Thank you.
4297180	4300180	Wait, no, is it also inside when you're at work?
4300380	4302140	Do you work in a park where it can run around?
4302780	4305620	No, but I'd stay inside all day too.
4307100	4307340	All right.
4307340	4308020	Give me a beat.
4310860	4325420	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, MC dong writes, yo, you got a best friend.
4326100	4328820	He's been with you from the beginning to the end.
4328820	4332300	He's got four little paws and a tail.
4333780	4336420	Yo, check your mail.
4337660	4339100	There's a letter from me.
4339860	4345540	I wrote it with a little blood and pee because I'm trapped in the fourth ring of
4345540	4346100	hell.
4346100	4353340	And I'm telling you, you got to get your dog and sell it to, to, to, to, to a park so
4353340	4354740	it can run around.
4360060	4362900	Let's just get second verse gets, it gets better because a different character
4362900	4363260	comes in.
4363980	4370100	Yo, rough, rough, rough, rough, rough, rough, rough, rough, rough, rough, rough,

4380340	4382140	I'm gonna fuck your mama.
4382380	4383700	What you gonna do?
4383700	4385380	Lift the leg to the left.
4385380	4387180	Click my leg to the right.
4387900	4390340	I fucked your mama last Tuesday night.
4391300	4394100	And then I woke up a Wednesday morning.
4394780	4397980	I fucking fucking fuck you.
4399820	4400620	Just give me a second.
4401700	4402900	There's a third character comes in.
4402900	4404700	What?
4404700	4415180	Mmm, dogs living in seclusion inside houses, indoor dogs, there should be no
4415180	4416260	such thing.
4417140	4419260	My name's Vincent Price.
4421060	4422340	I, I take it.
4422340	4425780	I had to tell you that from your reaction.
4425780	4434980	Vincent Price, and I'm here to say, now I'm the one that gets to rap today.
4435660	4440780	I usually do the talking part in the middle, but I'm Vincent Price.
4441100	4442180	I play the fiddle.
4443580	4446140	I put sausage on the griddle.
4446140	4449660	I, I love, I love your, I love Malcolm in the middle.
4452340	4452900	He does.
4452900	4453260	I bet.
4454340	4454620	All right.
4456340	4459460	Well, I hope that was exactly when the track ended.
4461180	4463260	You, you brought that right into the station, Dan.
4465340	4467500	Like you guys could have helped out better.
4467980	4469740	What, what would you want us to do?
4469780	4472100	Just throw in a, what?
4472220	4472660	Yeah.
4473980	4474700	Do you want to do it again?
4474740	4475380	No, I'm just trying.
4475380	4476620	I had to throw somebody under the bus.
4476620	4477500	I was a little embarrassed.
4477540	4479460	So you threw all of us under the bus.
4480820	4481580	It's a big bus.
4481580	4482460	I failed pretty hard.
4483860	4484700	A lot of room under there.
4484820	4485540	What are you talking about?
4485540	4491300	You say, I don't feel like I really learned a whole lot about dog rights and dogs in the city.
4491620	4493140	Just don't keep them indoors.
4493140	4493780	Like Molly said.
4493900	4494180	Yeah.
4495020	4495660	You know what?
4496020	4496820	Bring that beat back.
4496860	4497260	Oh, shit.
4497260	4497940	One more time, Dan.
4497980	4498300	Okay.
4499500	4500540	You want, you want the same beat?
4501060	4502540	Jonah, are you going to get up and lay down?
4502580	4503180	Fuck no.
4504540	4507460	Let's throw in some what's still a little fast, faster one.
4507820	4510220	You want some what's we can fail together.
4514700	4521180	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, tail to the snap.
4521420	4522140	Fuck your mama.
4522180	4526100	Then I took her out, took her out for Arby's and fries.
4526220	4527540	Fuck your mama in her thighs.
4527740	4529340	I can't get my dick in her.
4529340	4535540	So I just rub it in the place outside for her until I come put it on her and then I run.
4535860	4536740	I'm a dog.
4536900	4537660	I can't do it.
4537860	4539740	I got to go run through it.
4539780	4543780	The tunnel that is where all the dogs go after they fuck women and they run in the snow.
4544380	4546020	They got to lick, lick at the frost.
4546380	4547060	You got to do it.
4547220	4549820	That's the cost of being a dog.
4550060	4552420	You've been a dog.
4553660	4555260	That's just being a dog.
4555500	4557620	Then the frost being a dog.
4557740	4558260	Say what?
4558500	4560660	Being a dog.
4560820	4562300	Popping it in the north.
4562340	4563340	Fuck your mama so hard.
4563380	4564420	Still looking at Peter North.
4564620	4567780	North rhymes with North and North and North and I fucked your mama South and little
4567780	4568380	folk doing North.
4569060	4570420	East West in the fucking name.
4570420	4571540	They got to put their ears in the dick.
4571540	4572500	They got to put them in the dick.
4572500	4573900	Quite a gibberish rap.
4573900	4574500	Do you know the boob?
4574500	4576700	You can rap a lot faster when you don't say words.
4578700	4579780	You got to rap to the dick.
4579780	4580820	They got to do the dog.
4580820	4581860	They got to do the k-19.
4581860	4582860	They got to go for the deep.
4582860	4583860	They got to dig it up deep.
4583860	4584860	They got to air the deep.
4584860	4586980	They got to hit it big in the 9-11.
4586980	4587900	They got to hit it low.
4587900	4588900	They got to Donald Trump.
4588900	4590180	They got to do new taxes.
4590180	4591780	But you know, they got to hang low.
4591780	4593340	They got to raise a leg.
4593580	4597460	That's why you don't want to go down to the town with the dog and the frown of the
4597460	4598540	being a dog.
4598740	4601300	They said they're being a dog.
4601780	4604380	When you go out night, you got to fuck a dog.
4604380	4609780	Going to do it all night because it's being a dog, being a dog, being a dog.
4610020	4611220	My name is Mr.
4611220	4612100	Jones.
4612100	4613940	I want to do my tones.
4618260	4619460	My name is Mr.
4619460	4620140	Jones.
4620140	4622100	All I do is my tones.
4626380	4627580	I don't rap for Mr.
4627580	4628300	Jones.
4628300	4630100	All I do is all my tones.
4632540	4634540	That's my fucking tones.
4634540	4635700	Hey, man, Mr.
4635700	4638420	Jones, get the fuck out of my rap, doing your tones.
4638420	4640780	I'm trying to rap for the dog's perspective.
4640780	4641780	You're interrupting.
4641780	4644900	I have an effective rage about you.
4644900	4645580	Get out here.
4645580	4647180	You can't, you can't, fuck you.
4648580	4649180	What?
4650460	4651540	No, stop it.
4651540	4652780	Fuck you.
4652780	4654060	Fuck you, Mr.
4654060	4654980	Jones.
4654980	4657860	Fucking tone, tone, tone rapping, motherfucker.
4659020	4659860	No, I quit.
4659860	4660860	I did not quit.
4661340	4665220	I quit and then I'm going, I'm getting in my car and I'm driving away.
4668700	4670020	Yeah, keep, keep it up.
4672300	4673860	God damn, this light takes forever.
4675220	4676220	Yeah.
4678220	4679220	This new hit from Mr.
4679220	4680060	Jones.
4680060	4680700	Oh, no.
4680700	4682340	It's called the tone song.
4682340	4683140	Oh, no.
4683140	4684620	It's tapping the church.
4684620	4685620	Oh, shit.
4688420	4690140	I'm going to go to my girlfriend's house.
4690140	4691900	She's the only one that understands me.
4691900	4693180	Hello, my name is Mrs.
4693180	4693820	Jones.
4693820	4695180	I just married Mr.
4695180	4695700	Jones.
4695700	4696220	What?
4696220	4697180	Wait, I didn't even.
4699180	4701140	Is this on the radio?
4701140	4701580	I can't.
4701580	4702540	I'm your girlfriend.
4702540	4703420	I just married Mr.
4703420	4703900	Jones.
4703900	4705540	Wait, I'm on the radio?
4705540	4706900	No, I'm in your car.
4706900	4709420	I'm, you're in my car?
4709420	4710620	I'm in the trunk of your car.
4710620	4712860	Jesus Christ, he's on a truck?
4712860	4714700	Mr. Jones put me in here.
4714700	4716540	God, would you marry him?
4716540	4717260	I'm open.
4717260	4718380	Baby, are you okay?
4718380	4719620	Oh, my God, I can't breathe.
4720580	4721860	Wait, are you all right?
4721860	4722580	I love you.
4722580	4723540	I'm better now.
4723540	4724100	Jesus.
4724100	4725700	I am legally married to Mr. Jones.
4725700	4726740	Why would you do that?
4726740	4731220	You would have said, why do you like him?
4731220	4734020	Santa California says they're legally married now.
4734020	4737220	Well, we can do something about that.
4737220	4738740	I need to know if you love me, though.
4738740	4740260	If you don't, then I don't like you.
4741060	4742420	I feel like our relationship was kind of
4742420	4743220	hitting a plateau.
4744260	4745540	Then get out of my trunk.
4746260	4747620	I didn't want to be in your trunk.
4748580	4750020	Get out of it, then.
4752100	4752900	Get out!
4752900	4753380	Get out!
4754340	4754820	Get out!
4756020	4758020	I'm closing the trunk in five seconds.
4758020	4759940	I can't, I'm out of your trunk.
4759940	4760820	You can't get out?
4760820	4761700	I'm out of your trunk.
4761700	4762180	Oh, you're out.
4762180	4763220	I'm leaving, I'm walking away.
4763220	4764260	Well, I'm getting in it.
4765780	4766580	Now I'm getting out.
4771540	4773700	Wow, that was very good.
4773700	4775860	That was called Mr. Jones and me.
4778020	4780260	We're going to be big stars.
4780260	4783700	It's a socio-political commentary on urban dog having.
4785620	4787460	Yeah, that got crazy.
4789700	4791460	Well, let's check back in with Spencer.
4791460	4793380	What's going on in the world of politics?
4793380	4795060	Oh, let me tell you, guys.
4795700	4797940	The Iowa caucuses are upon us.
4797940	4799620	People are caucusing.
4799620	4801780	They're out there hitting the pavements.
4801780	4805860	Real shoe-leather work by the real working men
4805860	4808500	and women of Iowa, gentlemen.
4808500	4809300	What do you think the difference is
4809300	4811380	between the white caucus and the black caucus?
4811380	4812580	Probably the color.
4814740	4815460	Oh, wait.
4815460	4817860	White caucuses be voting like this.
4825780	4827700	And I don't think I have to show you what the black caucus.
4827700	4830580	But it's like, it's very free and easy.
4830580	4831540	I think we want to see it.
4831540	4834100	Well, it's just like, yeah.
4836820	4837620	And this is done.
4838900	4840820	It's just very simple and elegant.
4840820	4841460	Yeah.
4841460	4841940	It's nice.
4842820	4843300	My wife.
4844420	4846820	What? What's going on over there?
4847620	4849700	I just realized I forgot my keys.
4851060	4853540	So I want to make sure Kate's awake when I come back home.
4853540	4856340	Otherwise, I'm going to be standing outside with plastic bags
4858020	4859380	and a bathroom until-
4859380	4860740	Your neighbors are going to come out and go,
4860740	4862740	she clearly doesn't want to see you right now.
4864100	4865060	What is a caucus?
4866420	4870900	You know how we vote for the person we want in California?
4871460	4872660	Other places, they don't.
4874740	4875620	That's all I got.
4876740	4877540	What is a caucus?
4880580	4882340	I guess I could have helped a little.
4882980	4886580	Isn't it like, well, it's more like a representative democracy
4886580	4888820	where instead of one person, one vote,
4888820	4890580	it's like we get a bunch of delegates
4890580	4893060	and then those delegates get their delegates or something like-
4893060	4896180	Boring! Trump make America great again!
4900580	4901300	It's good.
4901300	4903060	I was so happy to see that SNL sketch
4903060	4904980	where Trump was like the straight man
4904980	4907380	and was like, Sarah Palin's crazy.
4907380	4908660	I'm going to be the new president
4908660	4910180	and SNL's all ready for it.
4910180	4910900	Like they're ready.
4910900	4912340	They're ready for eight years of-
4914100	4915860	I have bummed me out so much.
4915860	4918260	SNL seems like the only comedy property
4918260	4920740	that actually seems legitimately excited
4920740	4921940	for a Trump presidency.
4921940	4922180	Yeah.
4923220	4924580	Like most other comedies are like,
4924580	4925780	yeah, it's a joke.
4925780	4927700	But come on, we care about the poll.
4927700	4931700	You guys, a caucus has a faction within a legislative body
4931700	4934180	that pursues its interest through the legislative process.
4934980	4936340	That means nothing.
4936340	4937140	That meant nothing.
4937140	4937860	Smarty pants.
4938980	4941140	Or a meeting of party leaders to select candidates.
4941140	4941380	Elect-
4941380	4944420	Boring! Trump pay with 2016!
4946180	4947620	It really makes no difference.
4949060	4950100	Holy shit.
4950260	4953140	Jesus Christ.
4953140	4957140	Rob, who do you like for the GOP nomination?
4957140	4957940	Oh, don't do this.
4957940	4958740	Who do you like, Rob?
4959780	4960740	Who you feeling right now?
4961540	4962820	Who's got the smart money right now?
4962820	4963620	Man, I don't know.
4963620	4964420	Who's the smart money?
4964420	4965460	Senator pajamas.
4966020	4966500	Yeah.
4966500	4968180	Anybody that's got pajamas.
4968900	4970340	Are you part of the pajama caucus?
4970340	4970820	I am.
4971460	4972100	That I am.
4972100	4972820	What is a caucus?
4973620	4974660	What is a caucus?
4974660	4975860	It's a bunch of people getting together
4975860	4979140	to decide a party strategy and select their leaders
4979220	4980500	and kind of like who to support.
4980500	4981220	So it's a meeting?
4981220	4983220	It's a multi-hour moment.
4983220	4983780	It's a who?
4983780	4986020	It's like multi-hours of people meeting.
4986020	4986580	Multi-hours?
4986580	4987620	Like, hours?
4990420	4991620	Yeah, we got a word for it, man.
4993380	4995140	They have a quicker way of saying that.
4995140	4995860	Yeah.
4995860	4998260	It was like an hour, but like a lot of them.
4998260	4998740	Hours?
4998740	4999220	Yes!
5000340	5002420	It's a multi-day situation.
5002420	5002980	A week?
5002980	5003460	A week?
5003460	5004100	A week?
5004100	5006740	Hey, can somebody hand me that bag of multiple potato chips?
5009140	5010580	It's smaller.
5010580	5011300	Yeah.
5011300	5014020	It's like a quorum.
5014020	5016980	It's like a meeting about making a decision
5016980	5020420	that ultimately is done by show of hands or accounting votes,
5020420	5022180	but also there's a bunch of conversation.
5022180	5025940	It's not like a popular, it's like a caucus.
5025940	5027460	It's like a clusterfuck.
5027460	5028820	Yeah, it's just like a caucus.
5028820	5029620	It's like a caucus.
5029620	5033060	It's like why does Iowa have to be so important to the rest of the country?
5033060	5033780	I don't know, Joe.
5033780	5035140	Why does Iowa...
5035140	5036260	Oh, that's why you're doing a joke.
5036260	5038180	It's a police state.
5038180	5039780	They decided to go first.
5039780	5041700	You could just decide to go first.
5041700	5042180	Really?
5042180	5042900	Yeah.
5042900	5045460	Except, and that's what, like, I think Nevada was like,
5045460	5046580	we want to go first.
5046580	5048660	And then they like, now they're third or some shit.
5048660	5049380	I don't know.
5049380	5050660	But like, yeah, states are just...
5050660	5052740	They did a really bad job of deciding to go first.
5053860	5055940	Well, it's Nevada first, so...
5055940	5057300	Who said we'll go third?
5057300	5058500	Did they go first?
5058500	5058980	Who?
5063220	5063940	I mean, if they...
5063940	5066100	Why don't they take a rocket down?
5066260	5066580	Yeah.
5067220	5069380	Senator Pajamas, you do not have the floor.
5071540	5075380	Hey, I've got some stuff to say that the people want to hear.
5075380	5077540	Your sleepy time bill will never pass!
5082900	5085140	Oh, shit, guys.
5085140	5085460	What?
5086020	5087620	Man, I tell ya.
5087620	5088260	What is it?
5088260	5091620	It's gonna be a crazy week, I'll tell ya.
5092420	5095380	I got a lot of stuff that's gotta get done.
5095380	5096500	Oh, shit.
5097780	5098180	Wow.
5100340	5101140	Are you finding out?
5101140	5102420	I've got, I've got, like...
5102420	5104340	Are you about to wax rhapsodic right now?
5104340	5105540	No, no, no.
5106340	5110340	My couch situation is crazy in my living room.
5110340	5111620	Tell us about this couch situation.
5111620	5112500	Oh, my gosh.
5112500	5114580	One's long, one's short.
5114580	5115940	It's not working.
5115940	5118900	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
5118900	5121700	It's got a table that doesn't match the drapes.
5122980	5123940	If you know what I mean.
5124740	5125460	Are you finding it?
5125460	5128260	Speaking of which, Molly, can I ask you a question?
5134260	5135300	That reminds me.
5135300	5137380	This has been something I've been thinking about.
5137380	5138500	Came on stage, Rob.
5138500	5141780	Ever since you've come, I've got one thing in my mind.
5142420	5144820	I'm glad that you're thinking about that.
5144820	5145320	Yes.
5146180	5146680	So?
5150260	5151540	That was not intentional.
5154900	5158820	I just, I just did Tim Conway right there.
5161700	5165300	Rob, are you finding it harder to be creative as you get older?
5166740	5168100	I think we've proved it just now.
5168100	5168980	Yeah, yeah.
5168980	5169620	Definitely.
5169620	5170660	It's harder to...
5170660	5171460	Definitely, baby.
5171460	5174900	I don't know if it's just because it's a depleting thing or...
5174900	5176900	Or maybe because you've already done stuff,
5176900	5180100	so then you're like, well, this should, like, shouldn't be that easy.
5180100	5180580	I don't know.
5181220	5186260	Well, it's like, I think you're not only competing with everybody else around you,
5186260	5188180	but you're competing with the last thing you did.
5188180	5192020	So, you know, you did something that was like,
5192020	5193860	well, that's the best thing I've ever did.
5195060	5199460	You're gonna have to outdo the best thing you ever did in order to feel that same feeling.
5199460	5204580	I feel like it's always just like, I just want the shit to make sense.
5204580	5206660	And it's just so hard, it never makes sense.
5207220	5209140	Isn't that why shrobbing works?
5211540	5212420	Meaning, what do you mean?
5212420	5214980	As in, like, it doesn't make any sense?
5214980	5217220	Oh, yeah, because, well, yeah, it's a release from...
5217220	5223460	Yeah, shrob definitely represents for a lot of us the liberation from making fucking sense.
5223460	5225780	Yes. For sure.
5225780	5226260	Yes.
5226260	5230180	It's the new kind of comedy.
5230180	5232740	Yes. The new kind of comedy.
5234180	5236900	I'm the base of the new kind of comedy.
5236900	5238420	What's the new kind of comedy?
5238420	5240420	The new kind of comedy.
5241140	5244260	Where I just say things.
5245140	5245940	That's my bit.
5245940	5247780	I should have been a director.
5247780	5248660	Whose bit is that?
5248660	5250740	I should have said, like, I'm a director.
5250740	5252260	And so I said, I'm a writer.
5252260	5253540	It's fucking hard.
5253540	5254900	It's hard being a director, too.
5254900	5255780	Nah, come on.
5255780	5259060	If you're a director, you could do that.
5259060	5261380	Put the camera there and then put it there.
5261380	5263620	And you don't even have to use it if that's wrong.
5264340	5264980	Put it everywhere.
5264980	5265460	Dan!
5265460	5266660	Put the camera everywhere.
5266660	5267860	You just directed.
5267860	5268100	Yeah.
5268260	5270340	Put it everywhere.
5271460	5272420	And then say it through the scene.
5272420	5274820	I've been saying that for years, Dan.
5274820	5276260	You should be directing.
5276260	5278580	Directors get to rewrite scripts, too.
5278580	5280900	So it's like the easiest part of writing, right?
5280900	5281380	Yeah.
5281380	5283460	And everybody thinks that they make the movie.
5283460	5283940	Yeah.
5288100	5289220	So insane.
5289220	5291940	And I was just like, they couldn't be a dumber species.
5292660	5293460	The directors?
5293460	5293940	Yeah.
5293940	5295460	They're just like, yep, yep.
5295460	5296740	That's definitely true.
5298660	5300020	Even dumber than actors?
5300020	5302100	Get me out of here, Uber.
5302100	5302900	Yes.
5302900	5303460	You know why?
5303460	5303780	Yes.
5303780	5304420	Yes.
5304420	5307300	Because actors are smart enough, no matter how dumb they are,
5307300	5308500	that they're like, you know what?
5308500	5314180	I should stay under these lights and work hard to pretend to be someone else.
5314180	5316500	And a director could just be like, action!
5320260	5321300	Do it, different!
5323540	5324020	Can we get it?
5324020	5325140	Oh, did I forget to say cut?
5326020	5327380	That's the second A.D.'s form.
5328340	5331060	Oh, action again.
5331060	5331940	Do it, different.
5333700	5334740	Let's do a series.
5334740	5336100	Do it different five times.
5336100	5338740	Action, action, action, action, action, action, action, action, action, action.
5338740	5339780	I'm going home.
5340660	5341300	Holy shit.
5341300	5342980	Can you please direct something soon?
5345620	5347460	I want to see if you actually did that.
5347460	5350740	If you actually, it's like Dan Harmon's first feature film.
5350740	5353460	And then you get there and you literally just go,
5353460	5354100	action!
5354100	5354900	No, no, no, no.
5355620	5361540	And then all of it, all it is, is just like an experiment to see what the actors do
5361540	5363620	when you just make fart noises at them.
5364180	5367380	It's going to be like a Crispin Glover movie.
5369060	5370900	No, it'd be really good.
5370900	5372100	You should be directing.
5372100	5376020	You, you should have been directing a long time ago, but you don't want to.
5376020	5378340	I've got to perfect writing first.
5378340	5381460	Like why would you direct until you knew how to write?
5382020	5383300	Like it doesn't make any sense.
5383380	5385860	Like it doesn't look like it's just fucking hard to write already.
5385860	5388660	And then you know, it's like, oh, I should, I should add directing to this.
5388660	5391700	So I'm going to finish writing this and then I'll fucking blow up.
5391700	5392020	Sorry.
5393140	5395700	You guys keep writing and I'm going to go shoot what we do.
5395700	5398820	It's already bad because I can't finish making it good.
5398820	5401140	So are there no, are there no directors that you like?
5403300	5404660	You know, I really like Justin Lin.
5407780	5409780	He's, he's, he's, he's pretty good.
5410740	5411300	He's good.
5411940	5413220	He's a good friend of yours.
5416660	5417300	So mean.
5418420	5419220	Right?
5419220	5420500	He's really mean, right?
5420500	5421300	It's a mean guy.
5421300	5424980	Dan, Dan, were you happy with the episodes of community that Rob directed?
5424980	5426180	Oh, they're, they're, they're great.
5426180	5426420	Yeah.
5426420	5428100	I kept Yahoo alive, right?
5431140	5433460	Really, really, really put them on the map, right?
5433460	5435780	Yahoo screen really set the world on fire.
5435780	5438260	You actually took Yahoo off of Yahoo maps.
5438260	5443780	I think we, yeah, we did.
5444740	5446740	We finally did it, buddy.
5446740	5448020	We finally, finally did it.
5448020	5452340	We got back together and we sunk a 40 billion dollar corporation.
5452340	5453060	Kill the multinational.
5454340	5457060	Your little sitcom, kill the multinational corporation.
5458580	5460500	It's like, it's like they went, yeah.
5460500	5461620	Oh, shit.
5462500	5463700	Oh, fuck.
5463700	5465780	Oh, shit.
5466660	5468900	How much do pink balls cost?
5468900	5470180	Oh, my God.
5471380	5472660	Oh, my God.
5473700	5474580	Oh, my God.
5474580	5475300	Oh, my God.
5475300	5476180	Oh, my God.
5476180	5476900	Oh, my God.
5476900	5477540	Oh, my God.
5477540	5478020	Oh, my God.
5478020	5478820	Terry, sit down.
5478820	5479140	No.
5479140	5480020	Oh, my God.
5480020	5480900	Oh, my God.
5480900	5481460	Oh, my God.
5481460	5482500	Terry, it's going to be okay.
5482500	5483460	No, it's not.
5483460	5484260	Oh, my God.
5484260	5484820	Oh, my God.
5484820	5486180	What am I going to tell my wife?
5486180	5486820	Oh, my God.
5486820	5488340	What am I going to tell my kids?
5488340	5489460	We're so fucked.
5490660	5492100	We could run right now.
5492820	5493140	Really?
5493140	5493700	We could?
5493700	5494900	No, we're fucked.
5494900	5496340	They fucked us.
5496340	5497380	They fucked us.
5498100	5501700	They said they had, I went to the art show.
5501700	5503460	It looked like the place was packed.
5506100	5507700	The place was wall to wall.
5507700	5508580	In Meltdown?
5508580	5508900	Yeah.
5508900	5509860	In Los Angeles?
5509860	5510100	Yeah.
5510100	5512980	I thought there was like that everywhere.
5512980	5514260	Oh, shit.
5514260	5515140	Oh, fuck.
5515860	5516900	Oh, shit.
5516900	5518500	Oh, fuck, man.
5519300	5520100	God damn it.
5520100	5522260	We spent so much fucking money.
5523780	5529380	So much fucking money on that show that got canceled from NBC.
5529380	5530260	Oh, my God.
5531540	5532740	Jesus Christ.
5534100	5534580	Shit.
5535700	5537140	Well, at least Donald Glover.
5537140	5538020	No, he wasn't.
5538020	5538260	No.
5540340	5540660	No.
5541300	5542500	Oh, shit.
5542500	5543700	What were we thinking?
5543700	5544740	Oh, shit.
5545620	5547300	Oh, God.
5548100	5548900	Oh, shit.
5548900	5550820	Oh, fuck me.
5552020	5553460	Just fuck me.
5553460	5556100	Somebody just fucked me to death.
5556100	5557140	I want to die.
5560260	5568100	Oh, my God.
5568100	5569860	Oh, Jesus Christ.
5572420	5573860	Maybe I read the numbers wrong.
5573860	5574340	Let's go.
5574500	5577220	Oh, it's worse.
5577860	5580180	It's worse than I thought it was.
5581060	5582100	Oh, my God.
5583620	5584500	Oh, my God.
5584500	5585220	Oh, my God.
5586980	5587700	Oh, my God.
5589380	5590180	Mr. Yahoo.
5594100	5595060	Now's not a good time.
5595060	5595780	What do you need?
5595780	5596740	One second.
5596740	5597460	One second.
5597460	5598420	One second, please.
5598420	5604500	I'm just here to tell him about the board meeting.
5605700	5608900	Mr. Yahoo, there is a board meeting that is happening
5608900	5610980	actually in the room you're standing in right now.
5612180	5612820	Yeah.
5612820	5613620	Okay.
5613620	5614500	Okay.
5614500	5616180	Someone just wanted to remind you of that.
5617460	5618820	My name is Andrew.
5622180	5623140	His name is Andrew.
5623140	5628420	Andrew, you have the floor.
5629940	5630420	Please speak.
5632180	5633860	There's a board meeting.
5639300	5640260	Look, I am.
5640260	5642820	We're also life via satellite to all the shareholders.
5647700	5648580	Am I in trouble?
5650180	5652980	I can show the board members in if that's okay.
5653460	5658020	And also, John Scully is here and was
5660420	5662260	and your daughter, Lisa.
5666260	5668420	I'm sorry, your daughter Yahoo.
5670500	5671620	I fucked that joke up.
5673220	5674580	Your daughter Yahoo is here.
5675300	5677620	She thinks that you named Yahoo after her.
5677620	5677780	Yeah.
5679140	5680580	You're going to have to tell her that you didn't.
5681540	5683620	And in a situation that never happened.
5685540	5686020	All right.
5686020	5686980	Let's do this then.
5688900	5689780	Board member number one.
5689780	5692500	Board member number two.
5692500	5698820	Gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel.
5698820	5707540	Well, I'm CEO, head of the stockholders and chief board member.
5707540	5709540	My name is Johnson.
5710580	5719540	I'm CFO, co-head of the shareholders and I'm Samsung.
5722020	5724900	I'd like to know why I'm Yahoo.
5727060	5728340	I'm only seven.
5729700	5732740	Yahoo has been around for much longer than that.
5732740	5739780	I'd like to know why we spent 30 billion dollars this year on TV shows.
5741460	5742900	That no one wanted to watch.
5745700	5749380	I don't think all of the science is back in.
5749380	5752820	Gravel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel, gavel.
5752820	5753700	Rummel, rummel, rummel.
5756340	5758900	What's other space and who is Paul Fagg?
5758900	5778820	Well, he's a very, very talented director and we are lucky to be in business with him.
5779620	5785140	It says here you're doing a basketball show with someone named Tom and Arnold.
5785140	5789940	At the same time, pick a lane.
5791940	5793460	This is Johnson talking.
5794580	5796900	Not Samson, mind you, gavel.
5801300	5805380	The new form of comedy explains itself.
5808740	5809860	Roll the film, roll the film.
5809860	5816980	In the 1938 says a new form of comedy.
5816980	5818820	Look at those boys go.
5818820	5821220	Cary Grant's got a new form of comedy.
5823380	5826020	Lisa Yahoo, you could find your own way home, right?
5826020	5827140	I'm only seven.
5827140	5827780	That's okay.
5827780	5828500	Here's $50.
5829540	5830100	I'm rich.
5831860	5833220	I'm going to start my own network.
5834100	5835060	Good luck with that.
5835060	5836100	Good luck with that.
5836100	5837940	It's super easy.
5838740	5841060	It's so easy.
5841060	5842260	Good luck.
5842260	5844740	It's super easy.
5845780	5846900	Good luck.
5846900	5849220	And that's how CISO was born.
5852740	5855540	We'll probably cut that out from the ashes of Yahoo.
5855540	5856340	Come CISO.
5857220	5858660	Don't ya see?
5860420	5860900	Who?
5862580	5863060	That's who.
5863860	5873860	You guys on sleet stack, $3.99 a month, all the land of the lost you can get.
5873860	5881860	Wait, plus Garth Moringy's dark place, faulty tower, a new a new a new stand-up special by Aziz.
5883460	5886500	Are you saying I can get all those lee stacks I want for $3.99 a month?
5886500	5887060	Yeah.
5887060	5889700	Plus Aziz in Aziz stack.
5889700	5891700	Imagine the pasta Azizates.
5893940	5895380	What's going on with sleet stacks?
5897060	5899780	Did you hear that Aziz just launched Azizo?
5900740	5900980	Yes.
5901860	5903860	You Aziz it so you so.
5903860	5904500	Azoz it.
5905620	5906500	All right.
5906500	5907700	All right, everybody calm down.
5908580	5910100	Hey, Dan, we tried our best.
5911780	5912500	We're all going to die.
5913540	5914980	There's no way to monetize the internet.
5914980	5915700	We're all going to die.
5918180	5919700	That was the singularity.
5919700	5921380	The internet was the singularity.
5921380	5922020	Yeah.
5922020	5923700	It wasn't about intelligence.
5923700	5924660	It was about economy.
5924660	5928820	Like it was like the singularity is like, yeah, everything is free.
5929380	5929780	Yeah.
5929780	5931940	And we're like, wait, how do I work?
5933940	5935540	And the internet's like, you don't.
5935540	5937140	So that's the thing.
5937140	5939860	Most comedians haven't been making comedy the past five years.
5939860	5941140	They've been making content.
5941140	5941380	Yeah.
5943140	5945940	Yeah, the comics listening back home will really dig that one.
5949140	5951140	Jonah, I really loved your last content special.
5951140	5952580	Thank you so much.
5952580	5954740	You know, being a stand up content in.
5957380	5958180	All right.
5958180	5958580	AIDS.
5960980	5961780	What's good are they?
5962740	5963380	Is bad.
5963380	5965620	So go to omaze.com slash Rick and Morty.
5965620	5970260	I think it was so like, uh, maybe not mumble this part.
5970260	5972260	Well, I can't, I can't remember the web address.
5972260	5976420	I think it's omaze omaze.com slash Rick and Morty.
5976420	5977940	Just type in Dan Harmon and AIDS.
5978660	5986020	I can scroll down past all the Chevy J's voicemails and, uh, you'll, you'll, you'll,
5986020	5988500	you'll come to a thing at $10.
5988500	5992420	Every time you $10 gets you a chance that fucking there's a thing and you could be
5992420	5994340	a voice on Rick and Morty and you'll cure AIDS.
5994340	5995060	That should be enough.
5995060	5995780	That should be enough.
5996580	5998740	You selfish fucking AIDS lovers.
6000340	6001940	Oh, what's in it for me?
6001940	6005380	You can be in a cartoon and it's like fucking AIDS will be running down the street.
6005380	6005940	Unfettered.
6005940	6011300	Are you going to make that, are you going to make the winner appear as a anthropomorphic
6011300	6012180	AIDS virus?
6013780	6014660	They were AIDS.
6015860	6017460	The bitter irony.
6017460	6018500	I'd be a great bad guy, right?
6018500	6020020	It's supposed to be supposed to be a villain.
6020020	6020900	I'm AIDS.
6022260	6022980	Can I get you?
6025300	6027460	So we're not going to, we're probably not going to roleplay.
6027460	6030500	Uh, you know, we do what we want here at Harmon town.
6031460	6032420	You do you.
6032420	6035380	Oh, that's what I, that's what we always say is
6035380	6037300	you do you at Harmon town.
6038180	6041300	Uh, I'm so glad that we're not in Florida anymore.
6042260	6043380	Jesus Christ.
6043380	6044820	Wait, I missed that.
6044820	6046100	I was, I was doing another thing.
6046980	6048820	There was a guy that I was here.
6048820	6051220	A guy punched a guy on stage.
6051220	6053620	And that was probably the best thing that happened.
6054500	6055780	I beg your pardon.
6055780	6058020	Yeah, it was, it was a Florida man.
6058020	6058660	Don't go there.
6058660	6061060	Did we find out that was a stunt or an actual thing?
6061060	6062100	Oh, it was a stunt.
6062100	6062500	Yeah.
6062500	6063060	Oh, okay.
6063060	6064980	I mean, some people's friendships are stunts.
6066980	6072900	I say to the millions of people.
6072900	6074740	Well, there weren't millions of people at that convention,
6074740	6078500	but these are the sweetest, most wonderful people in the world.
6078500	6081940	And all of them were really nice and all of them are constantly apologizing
6081940	6084580	for being from Florida, which is not, that's insane.
6084580	6085860	I'm from Wisconsin.
6085860	6088900	I thought like, like, like, that's not, it doesn't define you.
6088900	6092900	Like, like, like the Armenians in Miami are identical to the,
6092900	6095300	to the Angelino ones, except for the two guys.
6095300	6096580	Are you pretty proud of your home?
6096580	6098820	Are you pretty proud of your home state after making a murder?
6099860	6100100	Yes.
6100660	6101060	Yes.
6101060	6101300	Yeah.
6101300	6102340	An hour's drive from my house.
6102340	6104260	It's crazy that there's that whole documentary.
6104260	6106020	And then you find out like he really did it.
6112420	6115380	It's like death of a salesman, but it wasn't in the title.
6118260	6120100	But it was because it's making a murderer.
6120100	6120500	Yeah.
6120500	6121780	And you're like, oh, he's a murderer.
6121780	6122020	Yeah.
6122020	6122180	Yeah.
6122180	6123540	The guy murdered that girl.
6123540	6124020	Crazy.
6125220	6126020	It's so nuts.
6126020	6127700	And then it was like, he didn't do it.
6127700	6128580	And then you watch the whole thing.
6128580	6129620	You're like, he fucking did it.
6133940	6135540	See, I thought so too, but Rob disagrees.
6135540	6136900	Rob, Rob thinks he didn't do it.
6136900	6138260	He thinks a brother did it.
6138260	6139540	I think one of his brothers.
6139540	6140980	Why isn't that in the documentary?
6140980	6141620	That's racist.
6141620	6142580	It wasn't about that.
6143460	6146340	Well, first of all, well, there's a part of it.
6146340	6149780	I didn't make the documentary as the documentarians, but I think one of his brothers.
6149780	6150980	Documentarians?
6150980	6154500	So you're defending a guy who burnt a cat to death?
6154500	6155700	No, I'm not defending it.
6155700	6159300	Because if anyone burns a cat to death, put them in jail for murder.
6159300	6160020	I don't care.
6160020	6160580	Yeah, exactly.
6160580	6163620	But a guy who wears og boots wouldn't understand that.
6166900	6167700	Sit down, Jonah.
6167700	6168180	Sit down.
6168180	6168660	Sorry.
6168660	6169460	Sorry.
6169460	6172580	Og boots make me so angry on lots of levels.
6172580	6174340	People aren't ready for your content right now, man.
6174340	6174740	You're right.
6174740	6175620	You're right.
6175620	6176740	Your content is too real.
6177380	6178020	I just can't.
6178020	6181300	I'm glad that I feel like they front loaded that cat burning thing,
6181300	6184980	because I was watching the whole thing with my girlfriend.
6184980	6190020	And I kept every roller coaster dip where your heart would sink.
6190580	6192820	We'd just grab each other's hands and go, he burnt a cat.
6194740	6195780	He burnt a cat.
6195780	6196500	Doesn't matter.
6196500	6197380	Now, they downplayed it.
6198500	6201380	He doused it with, I don't know, gas or something like that.
6201380	6202660	Oh, he just threw it on the fire.
6203380	6203860	No, no, no.
6203860	6204900	He did more than that.
6204900	6207140	He poured kerosene on top of the cat.
6207540	6208340	Threw it in the fire.
6208340	6208820	Threw it in the fire.
6208820	6210020	He didn't say that in the documentary.
6210020	6211380	They sure the fuck did it.
6211380	6212260	It's a trick, yeah.
6213140	6216020	If you research it, you find out he did much more of that.
6216020	6217620	And I mean, it sucks.
6217620	6221140	He sort of definitely, he definitely needed to go to jail for that.
6221140	6224100	Yeah, I mean, people that kill things should be in jail,
6224660	6226260	probably because they'll kill things.
6226980	6230500	But especially cats, though, because cats mind their own fucking business.
6230500	6234820	Even the shittiest cats in the world mind their own business.
6234980	6237940	There's no such thing as a cat that comes in your window and it's like,
6237940	6238660	hey, I'm a cat.
6238660	6239540	I'm going to fuck with you.
6240740	6243540	They might meow and say, feed me or pay attention to me.
6243540	6247140	But no cat has ever made their problem.
6247140	6251060	But that's the only reason cats ever whine or meow or paw at you
6251060	6253460	is because you have them trapped inside your house.
6254660	6257940	Everyone that's irritated by a cat is only because they're inside
6257940	6259220	and you won't let them out.
6259780	6260820	I don't think that's true.
6260820	6261700	I have a story about a cat.
6261700	6262500	Oh, shit.
6265060	6267460	That's funny because Molly brought the dog things.
6267460	6268820	Are you an indoor cat person?
6268820	6271620	Because cats shouldn't be let out because then they spread FIV
6271620	6273460	and they get all fucked up and eaten by coyotes.
6273460	6273780	I know.
6273780	6274580	Your cat has that.
6274580	6276020	But doesn't it doesn't shake?
6276020	6276420	Yeah.
6276420	6277460	Well, that's gross.
6278980	6280420	Go to omaze.com.
6282420	6284820	Go to omaze.com to have a voice.
6284820	6285300	Go to omaze.com.
6286660	6287140	That's all right.
6287700	6288660	Well, I mean, why can't-
6288660	6289940	You need to shame my cat.
6289940	6292660	That's crazy.
6292660	6293540	Episode title.
6295940	6298820	What do you expect from a manic panic pixie dream girl?
6304580	6306420	But what's your position on cats?
6306420	6307380	Well, one time-
6307380	6309700	Well, I just have a story about a cat one time
6309700	6313860	where I was sleeping in a basement in the house that I was renting
6313860	6318180	and the door, the window was open, but it opened up into the ground floor.
6318180	6321460	And so I was sleeping and I heard this noise in my room
6321460	6324660	and I thought it was a robber or a raccoon,
6324660	6328740	which are both equally awful to end up in your room in the dark.
6328740	6329940	Like, it's really scary.
6332660	6334020	You don't have to mime.
6334020	6337060	All she knows is that it had a black mask over its eyes.
6337060	6340740	Yeah, but it was a black cat, so I was pretty pissed.
6340740	6347220	So what's the crux of that story is that cats are bad.
6348660	6352900	No, I'm just saying that it doesn't always mean that cats do one thing.
6352900	6355700	They're not always indoor versus outdoor cats.
6355700	6357060	Sometimes they're indoor.
6357060	6359460	Sometimes they're outdoor and they come indoor unexpectedly
6359460	6360580	and they scare the shit out of you.
6360580	6361700	True. That's very true.
6362660	6363700	We should keep that in mind.
6363700	6365060	News flash.
6365060	6365860	Here's the thing.
6365860	6367380	Please be open-minded about it.
6367380	6368420	News flash.
6371460	6374100	Ladies and gentlemen, news flash.
6375060	6375940	Sometimes.
6377940	6380980	That's what I said with the fervor of the transgender movement.
6380980	6382420	Like, we need to fucking stop.
6382420	6385140	Like, why are you putting fucking indoor and outdoor on me?
6385140	6386980	I'm a fucking door cat.
6386980	6391780	Like, if there's a door, I go in, I go out, I'm fucking sick of this shit.
6391780	6393700	Senator Pajamas has the floor.
6395700	6397380	Gavo, gavo, gavo, gavo.
6399220	6400500	Oh, are you an indoor cat?
6400500	6401060	I don't know.
6401140	6403620	Fuck, how about an Instagram with me crying because you asked.
6406180	6410740	How about you fucking hurt me by asking and meow the fuck up.
6411620	6412500	Meow the fuck up.
6413620	6414500	I tried too hard.
6418500	6422180	Anyways, my point being, because I do think it's, yeah,
6422180	6425540	I feel bad for dogs that are pent up, but then the opposite applies.
6426340	6429860	People tend to, culturally, we consider cats like these things
6429940	6432100	that you open the door and let them out into the world.
6432100	6434500	But then we also talk about how that's inhumane.
6434500	6436340	Because the cats go out and they're like,
6436340	6438340	like they shouldn't, the cat should be indoors.
6439380	6440500	Something to think about.
6441140	6442100	Well, here's the thing.
6442100	6445140	It's like people, people get their faces scratched by cats.
6445780	6447780	Kids are bitten by cats.
6447780	6450260	And then like, everyone's like, that's just a cat.
6450260	6453860	When a dog like barks at a kid from across the street, everyone's like, put it down.
6453860	6455460	Yeah, they kill it.
6455460	6456420	It's ridiculous.
6456420	6457940	People are too nice to cats.
6457940	6459060	Oh, come on.
6459060	6459780	I agree.
6459780	6460500	I agree.
6460500	6461060	Wait a minute.
6461060	6461860	That led to that.
6461860	6464740	That's why the guy felt comfortable burning the cat alive.
6464740	6466020	There's anti-cat stigma.
6466740	6468900	That's why I think he didn't kill the girl.
6468900	6472100	If a cat scratches somebody, it's because somebody got in a cat's face.
6472100	6474340	If a dog bites somebody, well, first of all,
6474340	6477220	a dog can snap a two by four and a half with his jaws.
6477220	6478420	Descendant from wolves.
6478420	6480820	Cats are fucking descended from Egyptian cats.
6482660	6482820	No.
6482820	6484420	They can't do shit, but sit in your lap.
6484420	6487780	So Egyptian cats, Egyptians put a lot of people into slavery.
6487780	6489780	That's way worse than biting a two by four.
6490820	6491780	It's a cat.
6491780	6495940	The cats not doesn't own the Egyptian sin.
6495940	6498260	They fucking made statues of them.
6498260	6498900	They praise them.
6498900	6500980	The cats didn't make the statues.
6500980	6502260	How do you know we weren't around?
6503460	6504020	Interesting.
6506020	6507460	Tune into Jonah Ray's...
6509060	6512260	These questions answered and more on Hidden America.
6512260	6515140	Jonah Ray's running for Ben Carson's vice president.
6515380	6518100	All right, how do we close the show?
6518100	6519940	Oh, in song, fucker.
6519940	6522180	No, we've tried that.
6523060	6524420	Yeah, the last one did real good.
6524420	6525300	That was great, yeah.
6525300	6525940	It was a real good one.
6525940	6526980	No, I don't mean rap.
6526980	6527380	Let's just think about that.
6527380	6528740	I don't mean rap, I mean like a song,
6528740	6531300	like a We Are The World kind of like celebrity kind of thing.
6533300	6535380	You all pick a celebrity character that you want to be.
6536980	6542100	We do like an awareness-raising, fundraising kind of thing.
6543620	6544740	Hands Across America.
6544820	6545380	That's fun.
6545380	6546900	Farm-aid kind of shit.
6546900	6549620	Are you literally lifting something from Whose Line?
6549620	6550340	Is it anyway?
6551860	6552340	Yes.
6552340	6552660	Okay.
6553700	6557780	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
6557780	6559620	No, no, it's a good, it's a good one.
6559620	6563300	I'm being moved by the spirit right now of what's going on.
6563300	6563940	Like, like...
6563940	6565620	But that does sound like a Whose Line game.
6565620	6566420	Is that a Whose Line game?
6566420	6567140	No, it's not.
6567140	6567620	Okay.
6567620	6568820	Your voice got real high.
6568820	6571460	Last night, last night, I was taping Whose Line,
6571460	6573620	me and Wayne Brady and Joey Fatone from NSYNC
6573620	6575220	sang a boy band song to a dude.
6575220	6575940	It was pretty good.
6578180	6579060	But is there a Whose...
6579060	6582260	There's not a Whose Line game where it's like USA for Africa.
6582260	6582900	No, there's not.
6582900	6584100	And there's different celebrities.
6584100	6586660	And then Wayne Brady does the clumps.
6586660	6587140	No.
6587140	6587460	Okay.
6588020	6589300	Now that's funny.
6590100	6591860	That's some content I want to see.
6593940	6598900	You know, you'd be pleased to know I just signed him for eight mobisodes.
6601300	6602820	Can I get it on my Razer phone?
6604180	6604900	Wait for that.
6604900	6605940	No, okay.
6605940	6607700	In Seattle and Argentina, yes.
6609220	6610660	Does one specific state...
6610660	6612660	There's a very specifically shaped geofence.
6613300	6615780	It's shaped like a fucking dragon's tail.
6615780	6619780	Is there a part of the Pacific Ocean that I can get to, then maybe I can catch it?
6619780	6620580	Everyone in...
6620580	6627220	If you're in Canada and you exist in a swath of land that AT&T is about to invade,
6628500	6632180	you can watch three episodes of Money Python.
6632180	6632740	Yeah.
6632820	6634340	It's the biggest hit in Midway.
6637060	6638260	Boy, that geofencing.
6638260	6639140	That's gotta...
6639140	6639620	Boy.
6639620	6641700	Yeah, geofencing, man.
6642500	6642820	All right.
6644580	6647060	Well, do we have a track that we could do like a...
6647060	6648660	I gotta change my bags.
6652900	6653540	What did you do to your bag?
6653540	6654500	We're ending the show.
6654500	6655940	We're trying to end the show.
6655940	6657700	You can go ahead and end the show.
6657700	6658660	I'm gonna go change.
6658660	6660660	You're part of the ending, you fucking...
6662980	6663780	Asshole.
6663780	6665140	No, no, no.
6665140	6666980	I get to do those things.
6666980	6667860	I'm not doing it.
6669220	6670180	Okay.
6670180	6671060	And what's the cause?
6675060	6676580	Outdoor dogs, indoor cats.
6678820	6681140	But we're benefiting both of them?
6681140	6681540	I don't know.
6681540	6682820	Let's just pick something we're benefiting.
6682820	6683140	All right.
6683860	6684420	What?
6684420	6684980	Butts on...
6684980	6685780	Butts.
6685780	6686660	Butts, fucking butts.
6689140	6690180	Self-fucking butts.
6690500	6690980	What?
6691860	6692420	Bag foot.
6692420	6692900	Bag foot.
6694180	6694740	Bag feet.
6694740	6695620	Okay, bag feet.
6695620	6698500	There's people out there with bags on their feet.
6698500	6699380	Let's benefit them.
6700180	6700340	Yeah.
6701220	6705220	Because they complain, and we feel terrible for them.
6705220	6706260	They have rights.
6706260	6706500	Yeah.
6708340	6709860	Oh, yeah.
6709860	6710660	Gavel, gavel.
6710660	6714020	Hope you're all enjoying your eucalyptus soup.
6717940	6718900	And your Lexus.
6719620	6720340	Yeah.
6720340	6720660	Yo.
6721140	6721940	Yeah.
6721940	6722580	Peep this.
6722580	6725940	Peep either eucalyptus soup for one minute while Dan breaks it down.
6725940	6727220	Right now there's people out there,
6727220	6730420	you know what I'm saying, that don't have eucalyptus soup.
6731060	6734820	They're too busy focusing on what's on their feet to the street.
6735620	6735860	Yo.
6737380	6738500	Wait, but it's not a rap though.
6738500	6740020	It's a song, isn't it?
6740020	6744500	There's a time for everyone to get together.
6745220	6750340	Every bird has some fun, but also has another bird with a feather.
6751060	6755300	And when you look down at the thing that should cover your feet,
6755300	6757380	you don't want to see bags.
6757380	6759220	But some people see bags.
6759860	6762900	Bags on their feet, because we are the people.
6762900	6765060	Hello, I'm Mr. Jones.
6769700	6770900	Get the fuck out of here.
6775140	6776660	We belong to each other.
6777380	6779940	Every sister, every uncle and brother.
6781060	6785620	That rhyme was predictable, but this next one is delectable.
6787300	6788420	Yeah, that's impressive.
6789060	6792020	Fuck your mama so hard, I wrote a missive thing to her.
6792740	6794740	Like an old-timey letter writer.
6794740	6797940	I fucked your mama so hard that her pussy got tighter.
6799540	6801140	Thank you for coming to Hermit John, everybody.
6801140	6801780	Britain.
6803780	6804580	Rob Schwab.
6806980	6809940	Molly, the age cat shamer.
6812660	6814420	Spencer Crittenden, Jonah Ray.
6816740	6817780	I'm Jeff Davis.
6818580	6820740	Your mayor once again, Mr. Dan Harmon.
6828900	6829620	Get out of here.
6830260	6831460	You're not a real artist.
6831460	6833140	You just make tones.
6833140	6835460	You don't control Mr. Jones.
6835460	6837620	Mr. Jones makes his own tones.
6838580	6840500	I also invented cell phones.
6842660	6843460	And ringtones.
6845060	6846500	Drive fast, take chances, and then run.
6849940	6850820	Did you get any of that?
6852260	6857460	It's a good show.
6859620	6863460	Adióm.
