26600	28800	You lucky sons of bitches
28800	30800	Harmontown is now in session.
30800	33800	Let's get Rob Schwab out here right now.
33800	43600	ðŸŽµ
43600	48000	For good measure, what about Spencer Crittenden?
48000	55400	ðŸŽµ
55400	59400	And just in case that's not enough, how about your mayor of Hamilton, Dan Harmon?
59400	66400	ðŸŽµ
66400	76400	ðŸŽµ
76400	84400	ðŸŽµ
84400	112400	ðŸŽµ
113400	116400	Sorry to neglect you guys, the mama section.
116400	119400	Alright, come on, wait, first of all, what's happened?
119400	121400	Alright, thank you.
121400	123400	Thanks everybody.
123400	125400	How many Harmontowns are left?
125400	126400	Three, three.
126400	127400	Three left.
127400	128400	Including this one.
128400	129400	Yep.
129400	132400	Yay.
132400	134400	What's happening with the, there's another chair.
134400	135400	I don't know.
135400	137400	I think somebody's doing a bit.
137400	139400	He's doing a joke right now.
139400	143400	We would have figured out seating before three shows left.
143400	147400	Actually, my local choir is going to be coming in.
147400	151400	I'm glad someone cares about stage picture.
151400	155400	There was one thing that I wanted to share because we do sit up here and we go like,
155400	158400	oh, I heard this, I heard that, and I didn't understand it or whatever.
158400	163400	One of the guy, the guy that hosted my panel at the Norwegian Film Festival,
163400	168400	he sent me a message about getting to the bottom of this whole poop van 2 thing.
168400	175400	And if I go to my Instagram, he said, poop van 2 equals port van 2,
175400	181400	port road number 2, Norwegian kids TV show from the 80s about two adults
181400	185400	living together with a fucked up giraffe.
185400	187400	Port van 2.
187400	190400	We heard it as poop van 2.
190400	191400	Nope.
191400	192400	No such thing.
192400	193400	It wasn't something weird.
193400	197400	It was about two grownups and a giraffe for kids.
197400	199400	How was your trip, Dan?
199400	200400	Did you enjoy?
200400	201400	Loved it.
201400	202400	Loved it.
202400	204400	Loved you, Norway.
204400	207400	Props holding the line against Sweden.
207400	212400	I didn't know those people were ever fighting,
212400	218400	but the town we were in, it was 10 miles moved in one direction
218400	221400	because the old town got burnt down by the Swedes
221400	224400	during their fucking bitter struggle against the Swedes.
224400	229400	You talk to a Norwegian and they're like, they tolerate the Swedes.
229400	230400	And vice versa.
230400	232400	It's centuries old.
232400	235400	Older than our country is at all.
235400	238400	We don't have any opinion about the English,
238400	240400	so how old does that make our country?
240400	243400	You think in Europe, it's even older.
243400	244400	Thanks, Dan.
244400	245400	Whoa.
245400	247400	Don't we have a Swede in the house tonight?
247400	248400	We have Sofia, right?
248400	250400	Yeah.
250400	254400	She burned down that town.
254400	258400	I only have a handful of things to talk about.
258400	260400	I think that was one of them.
260400	262400	Another one is that it's Church's birthday.
262400	263400	Church's!
263400	264400	Yes!
264400	265400	Get up here, Church.
265400	266400	Stand up.
266400	267400	Church's.
267400	273400	Happy Church Day to Church.
273400	276400	Happy Church Day to Church.
276400	281400	Happy Church Day to Church.
281400	286400	Happy Church Day to Church.
286400	289400	Happy Church Day to Church.
289400	297400	Happy Church Day to Church.
297400	299400	Yay.
299400	305400	All of those photos you've been looking at.
305400	306400	Church, come on.
306400	307400	Come on.
307400	308400	Come on.
308400	309400	Come on.
309400	310400	Come up on the stage.
310400	311400	Join us, Church.
311400	316400	See you in one of the 17 chairs.
316400	319400	She's finding a slow way up.
319400	320400	It's dark.
320400	321400	Happy Birthday to Church, everybody.
321400	322400	Happy Birthday.
322400	323400	Happy Birthday.
323400	324400	Happy Birthday to Church.
324400	325400	Take your pick.
325400	326400	Do you believe in...
326400	327400	Oh.
327400	328400	Take your pick.
328400	329400	All right.
329400	333400	We thought Steve was just doing a weird joke, but really...
333400	339400	No, we are going to have a choir.
339400	342640	All those photos that you've been seeing for how long, Church, have you been taking those
342640	345320	photos to put on our Instagram account?
345320	346320	Three years.
346320	347320	Three years.
347320	348320	Whoa.
348320	349320	Yeah.
349320	350320	Jesus Christ.
350320	352600	This is why a show has to be quit.
352600	356640	Because before you know it, you're lost in cement.
356640	360640	We have to keep fresh or else we die.
360640	363120	I was fresh changing venues three times.
364120	365120	Yeah.
365120	366120	Yeah.
366120	367120	That was my favorite part.
367120	368120	Yeah.
368120	372120	Remember that one guy that was like, oh, you're changing venues, now you count down to your
372120	373120	podcast ending.
373120	375840	And we were like, fuck you, poser.
375840	376840	Foreshadowing.
376840	380400	He was right.
380400	384280	There's no way that he's around to feel joy.
384280	386120	If he is around, he's a hypocrite.
386120	390320	Because he was like, your podcast is going to end, and then he hung around for three
390320	391320	years.
392240	393240	So if you're listening.
393240	394240	That was after Meltdown.
394240	395240	Yeah.
395240	396240	It changed.
396240	400880	The only thing I wanted to talk about, I guess, is, well, I was going to say before I bring
400880	405480	our only guest out.
405480	406880	And I put guest in quotes.
406880	408440	Because honestly, what is a guest?
408440	410600	Probably like multiple sets of quotes.
410600	411600	Yeah.
411600	418760	Like, but I wanted to talk about the, the, the Pazuki at BJ's.
418760	420320	Yeah.
420320	424280	That's part, it's supposed to be, the idea is that it's a pizza cookie.
424280	426280	You mean the pizzuki.
426280	427280	Pizzuki.
427280	428280	Pizzuki.
428280	429280	Pizzuki.
429280	433520	Why don't we bring out former BJ's employee and semi-guest, Nick Rutherford.
433520	434520	Oh, shit.
434520	448040	Oh, your best friends are all your enemies, but I've come down for golden trees.
448040	452040	Brought his own chair, a purey shrub.
452040	464040	And let's bring out our real guest, political analyst, Kalei, the one who wanted to be here.
464040	476800	Who is it that was singing that song that was the play on music?
476800	477800	That's Kalei Fontecchi, everybody.
477800	478800	Kalei, what?
478800	479800	Kalei, right here.
479800	480800	Kalei.
480800	481800	There she is.
481800	482800	Hello, Kalei.
482800	483800	Kalei, what's that song called?
483800	484800	Wow.
484800	489880	It's Take a Dive by Kalei Kazoo.
489880	491520	Take a Dive by Kalei Kazoo.
491520	492520	Sing it.
492520	493520	Whoa.
493520	500680	Shrob, you didn't like it backstage when we found out it was Church's birthday and we
500680	502240	all sang Happy Church Day to her.
502240	505420	You didn't like it because you don't like, you just had a birthday.
505420	508240	You don't like it when people sing Happy Birthday to you.
508240	511720	You don't like it when people sing Happy Birthday to someone else in front of you.
511720	514320	You just don't like the Happy Birthday song.
514320	516160	You're just a villain.
516160	517880	You're just a terrible villain.
517880	519120	No, no, no.
519120	520120	Okay, okay.
520120	521440	Happy Birthday to you.
521440	524360	Happy Birthday, by the way.
524360	525960	Just trying 50.
525960	527720	Happy Birthday to you.
527720	529960	Happy Birthday to you.
529960	532960	Happy Birthday to you.
532960	542320	Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob, Shrob.
542320	544720	See, you just don't like it.
544720	545720	No.
545720	546720	Wait, wait, wait.
546720	549520	How is not to like?
549520	550720	Nobody likes singing it.
550720	551800	No one likes hearing it.
551800	553240	Yeah, we all hate it.
553240	554240	Yeah.
554240	556240	Happy Birthday to you.
556240	557240	Keep going.
557240	558240	All right.
558240	560240	Well, now I'm pretty ready.
560240	561240	Wait, wait.
561240	562240	I'm the, wait.
562240	563240	I'm the guest.
563240	567840	Remember, I brought that chair up.
567840	570920	Happy Birthday to guest.
570920	572200	All right.
572200	573200	Guest.
573200	574640	You worked at BJ's.
574640	576000	Let's talk about the pizzookie.
576000	577000	The pizzookie.
577000	579480	It's a pizza cookie.
579480	586160	The word pizza and the word cookie combined into the word pizzookie.
586160	587160	Pizzookie.
587160	588160	Pizzookie.
588160	589160	Pizzookie.
589160	590160	Pizzookie.
590160	592920	So what is the question?
592920	593920	Pizzookie.
593920	595560	It doesn't, I'm not buying it.
595560	597240	I don't like it either.
597240	599560	And also as you said in the lift.
599560	600560	Right.
600560	601640	Well, it's a...
601640	602640	You guys share the lift.
602640	607560	between a pizza and a cookie they're the same shape and they're cooked in the
607560	613140	same oven and pizzas don't have ice cream on them either so you should have
613140	617600	kept that bit in the lift for just you and I but I thought it was so insightful
617600	621840	it's like they're all wrong about this it's not a they don't have a right to
621840	625880	call that a hybrid between a pizza and a cookie or to pronounce it that way
625880	630160	there's it's they're all off-base the entire time is it delicious yeah but you
630160	634080	get it you can't call it a pizzookie I like the salted caramel one you guys
634080	638800	try that one oh boy and the monkey bread that one's not as great it's not very
638800	643040	moist hey it's me
643040	657120	it's me I love myself and what I'm named so someone does you know what they
657120	665800	really call pizza pizza cookies cookie skillets it makes sense because it's a
665800	672160	cookie with a skillet someone oh it was our lift driver who pointed out actually
672160	677480	if you worked backwards from what should be called a pizookie that should be a
677480	682760	name for if you when you're taking a poop and you pee during the poop because
682760	688960	it's a piss dookie yeah a pizookie yeah that makes sense but I tracked I still
688960	701000	stand by that you piss in a Suzuki but you yeah I feel you player but I think
701000	708560	that's a rarefied audience I don't know if you need a portmanteau fucking don't
709080	715840	dude I I just took the biggest piss on my Suzuki but versus like dude I was
715840	721120	taking a shit and I peed during it so that happens to everyone that should be
721120	726640	just called taking a shit but you took a pizookie yeah that should be called
726640	734680	cookies Nick Nick did you make were you in the kitchen or you a server but did
734680	740560	you make the pizzookas but no I was a server I opened up the Westlake village
740560	748200	BJ's flagship thank you whoa restaurant and I was a classic location I used to
748200	756760	patronize that one yeah did you ever see Wayne I don't think so he never ate
756760	762440	there he just rolled out his window you're doing great you know you serve a
762440	768720	lot of food today okay it's okay you just open you'll get better yeah I feel
768720	773400	attacked right now wait no that's coming from every side play from a bunch of
773400	777640	drunk people I wait can you talk because we were talking over our
777640	784000	pizookie about your your job at the bank oh yeah I was kind of entertaining yeah
784000	792240	well I mean after I was a server at BJ's I was a I was a temp at Citibank
792240	803320	let me hear my where my city peeps at whoa somebody hished chase yeah I chased
803320	808880	yeah that's a chase bank and I was a temp there when I first lived in New York
808880	814040	and you could make a lot of money as a temp in New York and I just I just
814040	818960	really milked that place dry it was right before they needed a huge bailout
818960	823720	from the government and you would go to work and then you would sleep on your
823720	828880	desk for two hours and then during lunch you would go to the park and sleep on
828880	833360	newspapers do you want to tell the story well I I kind of hating the
833360	836920	highlights because I think it's such a funny image of like a kid in the play
836920	840240	playing the system because like you were sleeping on newspapers and then you'd
840240	844480	come back to the office and type in a spreadsheet and then they'd go boy look
844480	849200	at this kid yeah I know I mean you hit all the highlights yeah I mean oh yeah
849200	855760	do we don't have to waste any time now what's it like being 50 bro it's not
855760	862360	like half the age of a tortoise what what's it like being 50 how's it what's
862360	868960	it what's it like I feel so good Jeff what was it like wherever you were I
869200	878160	was in Alaska fucking cold the show me say state it's the show me that you're
878160	882000	you're freezing to death state it's a fucking cold age you go to the
882000	894320	blockbuster Alaska oh I thought you were I didn't I thought you were teeing up
894800	908520	I don't know what's good all right was it was it a day or night there it was
908520	917640	mostly night it was the Sun came up at 944 and then it came down at 946 the
917640	921920	Sun kind of just just introduced itself over the horizon they just went and said
921920	926720	I'm lazy I feel like I would like that but am I wrong no you're wrong because
926720	933000	you wake up in the morning and you're like it's 845 a.m. and it's pitch black
933000	936600	outside you want some feedback you you want to you want to know that you're
936600	942120	alive you want a straight line like like people like we were like oh I don't I
942120	948080	don't like the day it's neurotypical shit but you want it there so that you
948080	952680	can play off of it yeah you want to be like but then the Sun in the summer in
952680	957600	the Sun in the summer the Sun never sets it's daylight all the time but when you
957600	963720	get into the fall wintertime spring it's just dusk at all times it feels like in
963720	968680	both cases to me it sounds romantic like I would want to experience it but like
968680	974320	I'm assuming that it would be awful when you wake up at like it's 830 a.m. and
974320	978440	it's black outside like it's totally nighttime you're like okay I want
978440	982880	breakfast but not in the dark and you don't and you don't have any indication
982880	988240	about like any even to defy it like some definition of whether you're a loser or
988240	995400	a winner or punk rock like electricity they have lights but that doesn't feel
995400	999400	the same yeah yeah you can turn the lights on time but your hotel room can
999400	1005440	turn lights on but it feels like it's still 4 a.m. right yeah I think that
1005440	1010280	would be bad I'm gonna go with bad well I think Alaska would feel differently and
1010280	1016840	we got Alaska here tonight let's give it up for Alaska what oh shit we have a
1016840	1022360	guest Nick Rutherford everybody all right well let's get to the show let's

1028720	1033000	he's got a pedal that changes voices yeah I thought we were gonna wait I
1033000	1037160	will say this Rob said cuz it's his birthday he said we should ask the
1037160	1041160	audience to throw up any drugs they have on the stage and he would do any drugs
1041160	1053160	that we're throwing up on the stage whoa Advil I just shot just shot it out
1053160	1058880	who's holding class a narcotics in the crowd right now instead of like going oh
1058880	1065960	Steve's got drugs thanks Steve Lee Lee instead of asking who like came the
1065960	1069360	farthest like who came from the farthest away we should ask like who has
1069360	1075840	the hardest drugs on who here is currently holding ice evidence Steve
1075840	1084000	Levy I wanted to I wanted to go to the random word generator that I discovered
1084000	1090000	today because you can just generate two random words but I forgot there's no

1816420	1818260	you should get your money back.
1818260	1819820	Because the whole thing should be pizza.
1819820	1821860	You shouldn't be leaving any of it aside.
1821860	1822740	Oh, this is crust.
1822740	1824500	No, it's all pizza.

1880140	1882260	Church, where'd you go?
1882260	1883380	That's fucking funny.
1885380	1886900	She was brought up because it was her birthday.
1886900	1889660	She's like, what am I, I'm hostage up here.

1891260	1892580	I'm with you, man.
1892580	1896220	Especially the number nine funniest thing.
1896220	1899780	Number nine funniest thing, the Macarena.

1923380	1930380	A grape returning a shirt at Target.
1933380	1934980	That's correct.
1935980	1937300	That is it.
1939100	1941660	Number six funniest thing.
1941660	1942980	Should we skip seven or?
1942980	1946340	I would have thought a grape returning a shirt
1946340	1948780	would have been number one, but it don't.
1948780	1950900	It changes every time.
1950900	1953100	Are we at number seven now or number six?
1953100	1954580	I think we're at seven.
1954580	1955580	Number seven.
1955580	1957580	Seven funniest thing.
1958580	1961540	A lot of people are hissing the word six.
1961540	1964580	Yeah, the grape returning a shirt was number seven.
1964580	1965820	Okay, all right.
1965820	1966820	So we're at six.
1966820	1968780	We're on six.
1968780	1970980	I personally didn't think it was that funny.
1971980	1973580	I think that's fair.
1973580	1975180	We're at number six.
1975340	1976540	We're at number six.
1976540	1979900	Number six is an angry bus driver.
1979900	1982500	Ooh, angry bus driver.
1982500	1984300	And he's racist.
1986300	1988020	I bet he thinks he's not funny at all.
1988020	1989820	He probably thinks he's telling the truth.
1989820	1990820	He's just living life.
1990820	1991660	It's not up to him.
1991660	1993420	That's why it's that's what's funny about.
1993420	1997180	Just the angry bus driver who's a racist say his jokes over the
1997180	1998540	like PS system.
1998540	1999500	I don't I don't know.

2002660	2004220	racist Beaumont?
2004220	2006900	I don't know.
2006900	2010900	No, it's probably a good we're about halfway through the list.
2010900	2015900	We should probably just show the racist bus driver movie.
2015900	2016900	Oh, yeah.
2025900	2029900	Keep it down back there, depending on your skin color.
2033660	2036660	That's a certain amount of offensive to me.

2107660	2110660	You're all free to do whatever you want.
2110660	2114660	The question is what's going to antagonize me, your bus driver.
2114660	2116660	That answer will be graded on a curve.
2116660	2118660	I assure you.
2118660	2121660	As I am thoroughly racist.
2123660	2128660	I'm going to eat my own country's bread now.
2130660	2133660	Better be my country.
2133660	2136660	Better be my country.
2136660	2140660	Oh, we dip our bread in mayonnaise.
2140660	2142660	I hear so much mission guys back there.
2142660	2145660	I can't concentrate on being a good bus driver.
2145660	2148660	Could you drive a little slower, please?
2148660	2153660	Can you turn the bus to the south?
2153660	2155660	Yes, yes.
2155660	2157660	How far south?
2157660	2161660	Just do south so I can pray.
2162660	2164660	To whom?
2164660	2166660	What does it matter?
2166660	2169660	You're right, it shouldn't, but...
2169660	2173660	This is the coolest bus driver ever.
2173660	2175660	This is cat rules.
2175660	2178660	All right, I've turned south.
2178660	2179660	I hope...
2179660	2183660	I'm going to pray myself that your God is appropriate.
2183660	2190660	Please, racist God, let my passenger face south toward the right God.
2190660	2192660	That I may continue to bus drive him
2192660	2196660	and sleep at night tonight with my racist head on my pillow.
2196660	2197660	Amen.
2197660	2199660	Are you all finished?
2199660	2201660	Yeah, I'm okay.
2201660	2202660	Okay.
2202660	2204660	Well, we're behind schedule now.
2204660	2206660	You're making it weird up there, man.
2206660	2209660	I'm not weird, I'm normal.
2209660	2213660	Why is he doing that with his legs?
2215660	2218660	It's a pedal bus, man.
2219660	2224660	Last stop, Albuquerque Square.
2225660	2229660	Can everybody get off the bus?
2229660	2231660	I'm not leaving the bus.
2231660	2234660	I'm leaving the bus.
2236660	2240660	I'm waiting for a cab,
2240660	2245660	because I'm racist against long vehicles.
2246660	2248660	I'm finished with my shift.
2248660	2250660	That's all I know.
2250660	2251660	See you later.
2251660	2254660	Taking my mic back off,
2254660	2256660	my star,
2256660	2258660	my taser,
2258660	2261660	my changed converter,
2261660	2263660	my spare battery,
2263660	2265660	my bus hat,
2265660	2268660	my collar enforcer,
2268660	2271660	my regular collar,
2271660	2274660	my collar underlier,
2274660	2276660	my sub-collar,
2276660	2279660	my niggler collar,
2279660	2285660	and my dick-a-talage force field.
2285660	2289660	Now, time to go home to my wife and children.
2289660	2291660	What's your wife's name?
2291660	2293660	What?
2293660	2295660	You're not supposed to still be on the bus.
2295660	2298660	I'm racist.
2298660	2301660	I don't have legs.
2301660	2305660	All my life, I've categorized people by race.
2305660	2308660	This one lacks an ability.
2310660	2313660	Tear me off the bus to your wife.
2313660	2316660	What race are you?
2316660	2318660	I'm...
2318660	2320660	Well, can't you tell?
2320660	2322660	I can.
2322660	2325660	You're a race in need.
2326660	2330660	A race in need is a race in deed.
2330660	2332660	Yay!
2332660	2334660	Come off the bus.
2334660	2337660	Why are you grabbing the side of my breast?
2337660	2341660	Sorry, I don't know how to help.
2342660	2344660	I'm a curmudgeon.
2344660	2348660	Most films are about people like me.
2348660	2351660	We start as comedically flawed,
2351660	2354660	and then we progress to being normal.
2354660	2356660	And then it's an arc.
2356660	2359660	Like, oh, I can't stand popsicles.
2359660	2362660	And then it's like, oh, yeah, the third act, I can eat the popsicles.
2362660	2364660	Okay, cool.
2364660	2366660	Cool, whatever.
2366660	2367660	Sorry, I didn't mean to...
2367660	2369660	No, no, we've all done it.
2369660	2370660	Here's my bus station.
2370660	2371660	Sit down!
2371660	2372660	I'm grumpy.
2372660	2373660	You racial person.
2373660	2374660	Why?
2374660	2376660	Eat your popsicle.
2376660	2377660	Why?
2377660	2379660	I'm tired of your race.
2379660	2383660	I hope you like sandwiches on a hot plate.
2383660	2386660	Extra, extra, read all about it.
2386660	2387660	Who's that?
2387660	2389660	I don't want your racial news.
2389660	2391660	Extra, read all about it.
2391660	2392660	Give me it.
2392660	2393660	Let go.
2393660	2394660	Stupid.
2394660	2395660	It's my last paper.
2395660	2396660	You're an idiot.
2396660	2397660	Shut up.
2397660	2398660	I'm...
2398660	2399660	Go away.
2399660	2400660	I can't breathe.
2400660	2402660	I don't like anyone.
2402660	2403660	I hate them all.
2403660	2406660	I'll never be different.
2408660	2413660	He was the biggest racist of all.
2413660	2422660	And for one who loves all the races is not...
2422660	2426660	No one who is welcome in the kingdom of me.
2426660	2429660	Hitler Christ.
2431660	2433660	Whoa.
2435660	2438660	I hear that voice every day.
2439660	2441660	Haunts me at night.
2441660	2444660	What did he mean by that?
2444660	2447660	What's up, dawg?
2448660	2451660	Let's get Boba, man.
2452660	2455660	I'm Hitler Christ.
2460660	2462660	Only I can see you.
2462660	2464660	That's right.
2465660	2467660	That's the way I like it.
2468660	2471660	Okay, so now we're going to win an Oscar, right?
2472660	2475660	Hey, man, we just make this art for art's sake.
2475660	2480660	If the academy recognizes it, that's their prerogative.
2482660	2483660	Oh, shit.
2483660	2484660	Hello?
2484660	2487660	This is the bus driver boss.
2487660	2488660	Shit.
2488660	2492660	Hey, there are people just flooding the streets.
2492660	2494660	No one's picking them up.
2494660	2497660	I just stopped at home to make a sandwich and a hot plate.
2497660	2499660	You eat your sandwich on your own time.
2499660	2502660	Get in that bus and pick up some people.
2502660	2504660	The streets are filled.
2505660	2506660	Damn it, you racial character.
2506660	2508660	You cost me my job.
2508660	2509660	Get up. Come on.
2509660	2511660	Where am I supposed to go?
2511660	2512660	I'm sick of you.
2512660	2514660	Go wherever you want, but get on the bus with me.
2514660	2516660	I'll always be in your mind.
2516660	2518660	I wanted to get on the bus.
2518660	2520660	For Christ's sake.
2520660	2523660	I'm going to get into the door right behind your door.
2523660	2524660	God damn it.
2524660	2526660	I want to get on the bus, too.
2526660	2529660	What a road of trials I'm on.
2529660	2531660	Let all these people on.
2531660	2533660	Hey, let us all on the bus.
2535660	2537660	We're driving by the bus?
2537660	2539660	When's the guy?
2539660	2541660	You got it. You got to keep this.
2541660	2543660	I can't stop for anyone.
2543660	2544660	They're too ethnic.
2544660	2545660	Come on, come back.
2545660	2546660	No.
2546660	2547660	I won't pick any of you up.
2547660	2549660	I'm just going to drive by the bus.
2549660	2551660	You've got to keep this.
2551660	2554660	I'll drive the bus.
2554660	2557660	I'm a racist bus driver.
2557660	2559660	Oh, no.
2559660	2561660	Billboard for Marlboro.
2561660	2562660	No.
2562660	2564660	No.
2564660	2569660	No.
2569660	2572660	Up, up, up, up, up.
2572660	2577660	Sail away, sail away, sail away.
2577660	2578660	Wait, wait, wait.
2578660	2579660	There's a, okay.
2579660	2583660	Sail away, sail away, sail away.
2583660	2585660	Yeah, all right.
2585660	2590660	Sail away, sail away, sail away.
2590660	2597660	Sail away, sail away, sail away, sail away.
2597660	2600660	My hands.
2600660	2601660	My hands.
2601660	2604660	You finally have hands.
2605660	2610660	They're back now.
2610660	2612660	I'm ready.
2612660	2616660	I'm ready to not be racist.
2616660	2619660	Then get the fuck off my bus, man.
2619660	2628660	Sail away, sail away, sail away, sail away.
2635660	2643660	Well, I don't think, I mean, I'm not going to defend our material, but I don't think that was the right way to end it.
2643660	2644660	You can't defend gravity.
2644660	2648660	So that is the sixth funniest thing.
2648660	2653660	Yeah, that was a racist bus driver.
2653660	2655660	We got a long show ahead, you guys.
2655660	2659660	So not every item on the list is going to be that long.
2659660	2661660	That was just like the intermission.
2661660	2665660	Certainly taking care of him.
2665660	2666660	Shrob Dean wants something.
2666660	2667660	All right, fifth funniest thing.
2667660	2668660	What is it?
2668660	2669660	Rodbark School.
2669660	2670660	Big funniest thing.
2670660	2671660	Rodbark School.
2671660	2672660	Rodbark School.
2672660	2673660	Rodbark School.
2673660	2674660	Rodbark School.
2674660	2676660	Isn't there a children's show about that already?
2676660	2677660	What?
2677660	2678660	Take a shot at Rodbark School.
2678660	2680660	Yeah, isn't Arthur the Rodbark?
2680660	2681660	What?
2681660	2682660	It is pretty funny.
2682660	2683660	That is.
2685660	2688660	Jeremy, Rodbark?
2689660	2692660	Who is?
2692660	2694660	Todd Rodbark?
2694660	2695660	Present.
2695660	2698660	Here.
2698660	2700660	Missy Rodbark?
2700660	2702660	You.
2702660	2705660	Christopher Rodbark?
2705660	2709660	You may call me Royale Champagne.
2709660	2712660	Brad Rodbark?
2712660	2715660	That's me.
2715660	2717660	Kim Rodbark?
2717660	2719660	Is this an alphabetical order?
2719660	2722660	Yeah, Rodbark.
2722660	2725660	We're on the A's.
2725660	2728660	Yeah, I'm Jim Rodbark and I happen to be pregnant
2728660	2731660	and you're not going to tell me how to run my life.
2731660	2733660	Okay.
2733660	2736660	Shelly Rodbark?
2736660	2739660	Yeah, hi.
2739660	2741660	I'm friends with...
2741660	2743660	Michael Rodbark?
2743660	2745660	Yes, I'm Michael Rodbark and I'm wondering
2745660	2747660	what is Rodbark School?
2747660	2749660	As an Rodbark, I...
2749660	2751660	Oh, fucking Michael.
2751660	2753660	Always questioning things.
2753660	2758660	Michael, raise your hand before you start talking.
2758660	2759660	I'm an Rodbark.
2759660	2761660	I don't have hands.
2761660	2763660	Yeah, well, then you're never going to talk.
2763660	2765660	Shut the fuck up.
2765660	2767660	Racist.
2767660	2770660	Yeah, that's the fifth funniest thing.
2771660	2774660	We now go to the fourth funniest thing.
2774660	2779660	Rodbark School really earned its purchase in the middle of the list.
2779660	2781660	The fourth funniest thing.
2781660	2785660	You can see why racist bus drivers one notch below
2785660	2789660	because it took 20 minutes to be half as funny.
2789660	2794660	I get it, I get it.
2794660	2796660	Racist bus driver.
2796660	2797660	I get it.
2797660	2800660	Rodbark School, now the fourth funniest thing.
2800660	2803660	Living wreaths.
2803660	2806660	Living wreaths.
2806660	2807660	Living wreaths.
2807660	2811660	Let's cut straight to the third funniest thing.
2811660	2815660	I want to know why living wreaths beat out Rodbark School.
2815660	2820660	Perhaps this short subject will...
2820660	2822660	Jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle, jingle.
2822660	2824660	Let's hear the sleigh bells ring.
2824660	2829660	Come on, Jessica, you're going to be late for the ice.
2829660	2832660	My feet are frozen onto the ground.
2832660	2835660	Who cares? We're dating. Come on.
2835660	2837660	Okay.
2837660	2840660	Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.
2840660	2843660	Hey, take it easy, baby.
2847660	2850660	I wanted to get you a ring for Christmas,
2850660	2855660	but all I could afford were these two wreaths.
2855660	2859660	Thank you, Jessica.
2859660	2863660	Oh, hello. I'm one of the wreaths.
2863660	2865660	Oh, shit.
2865660	2868660	I'm Hitler Christ.
2868660	2870660	All right, I get it. I see why that's funny.
2870660	2871660	That seems funny.
2871660	2872660	That one works.
2872660	2874660	That seems funnier than Rodbark School.
2874660	2876660	Well, we're getting funnier.
2876660	2879660	We're down to the top three funniest things.
2879660	2882660	Wow, this bar is getting high.
2882660	2885660	It's going to get to the point where the number one thing
2885660	2888660	doesn't even need a scene to explain it.
2888660	2891660	It'll all be references to the last nine things.
2891660	2894660	So the number three funniest thing...
2894660	2896660	Yeah, we know. We can say it at the same time.
2896660	2898660	Sure.
2898660	2902660	Baby, baby with a mustache.
2902660	2905660	Yeah.
2905660	2908660	Good thing we didn't have to say it at the same time.
2909660	2912660	Okay, okay. Okay, now one more time.
2912660	2915660	Push, push, push.
2915660	2917660	Come on, baby. Come on, baby. You can do it, baby.
2917660	2918660	Come on, baby.
2918660	2920660	Baby, I'm with you, baby.
2920660	2921660	One big final push.
2921660	2924660	Baby, I'm with you, baby. Come on, baby.
2924660	2926660	Oh, baby. Oh, it's coming out, baby.
2926660	2928660	It's coming out.
2928660	2934660	I'm a baby.
2934660	2938660	I need other oxygen.
2938660	2940660	Oh, fuck. He's got something to say.
2940660	2944660	We are now down to the top two.
2944660	2948660	Wait, why did you cut off baby with a mustache early?
2948660	2952660	Why did you give so much time to the bus driver?
2952660	2955660	People were calling in why there were two doctors.
2955660	2958660	Race's bus driver needed some more legs, I thought.
2958660	2961660	That was the wreath couple.
2961660	2963660	Two dudes who were abusing each other.
2963660	2966660	We barely got into the actual living wreaths.
2966660	2974660	I get it.
2974660	2976660	What are we to decide, you know?
2976660	2977660	Top two funniest things.
2977660	2983660	Okay, Batmobile sandwich.
2983660	2985660	It requires no explanation, right?
2985660	2986660	Yeah.
2986660	2987660	Now let's go right into the spot.
2987660	2990660	A lot of times these top ten lists get shorter and shorter at the end.
2990660	2991660	Yeah, yeah.
2991660	2993660	Because they're automatically...
2993660	2995660	But in case you need to know, like...
2995660	2996660	Right.
2996660	2999660	Alfred.
2999660	3002660	Oh, yes, Mr. Queen.
3002660	3007660	Okay, I've been fighting crime a lot all day.
3007660	3008660	Yes.
3008660	3010660	And what have you brought me here?
3010660	3011660	What is this?
3011660	3013660	Eat me, eat me.
3013660	3017660	Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
3017660	3021660	It's your favorite.
3022660	3023660	Boom, boom, boom.
3023660	3026660	I ain't got a jet.
3026660	3030660	It's talking to me.
3030660	3031660	Yep.
3031660	3032660	Your favorite.
3032660	3036660	It is a Batmobile sandwich.
3036660	3037660	Ooh.
3037660	3040660	Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
3040660	3043660	Do you want me to cut it in half for you?
3043660	3046660	Yum, yum, yum.
3046660	3048660	Hello, Batman.
3048660	3051660	I'm Mr. Bacon.
3051660	3055660	Why did you back up into the...
3055660	3057660	Batcave.
3057660	3061660	I find it more efficient to back into a Batcave
3061660	3065660	so I can drive straight out of it with all of the bacon.
3065660	3068660	Your sandwich will be bacon-less, Batman.
3068660	3069660	You're a villain.
3069660	3071660	Yes.
3071660	3073660	You just backed in here.
3073660	3074660	Alfred.
3074660	3075660	What?
3075660	3076660	Way to go.
3076660	3078660	These things are unrelated.
3078660	3080660	It's impossible.
3080660	3083660	See, the dots are somewhat easy to connect.
3083660	3086660	You brought me a sentient sandwich shaped like my car.
3086660	3087660	Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
3087660	3089660	Yes, and I've stolen all your bacon.
3089660	3091660	In this case...
3091660	3095660	Yes, your BLT will just be an LT.
3095660	3096660	From now on.
3096660	3098660	Yes, for the rest of time.
3098660	3099660	From now on, I will fight crime.
3099660	3100660	What?
3100660	3101660	What?
3101660	3102660	What?
3102660	3103660	No.
3103660	3104660	I'm sorry.
3104660	3106660	It's a one-way walkie-talkie.
3106660	3107660	From now on.
3107660	3108660	From now on.
3108660	3109660	Wait, what?
3109660	3110660	What?
3110660	3111660	What?
3111660	3112660	Who's on?
3112660	3113660	From now on.
3113660	3114660	Are we on conference go?
3114660	3115660	From now on.
3115660	3116660	Yeah.
3116660	3117660	This is Batman.
3117660	3118660	Batman is talking about you.
3118660	3119660	Batman is talking about you.
3119660	3120660	Batman is talking about you.
3120660	3121660	Go ahead, Batman.
3121660	3122660	From crime-fighting department.
3122660	3123660	I'll come back later.
3123660	3124660	No, you stay on.
3124660	3126660	You brought me the sandwich.
3126660	3127660	The sandwich is...
3127660	3128660	Yum, yum, yum.
3128660	3129660	Talking to me.
3129660	3130660	I got...
3130660	3131660	Shaped like my car.
3131660	3132660	I've stolen the bacon.
3132660	3133660	Bacon man pulled his truck into the Batcave.
3133660	3134660	Bacon man?
3134660	3135660	What?
3135660	3136660	You're fucking racist?
3136660	3137660	What are you...
3137660	3144740	I have a lot of laundry to fold upstairs.
3144740	3149180	Are we done?
3149180	3152100	I'm going to the Bat booth.
3152100	3153660	And then I'll deal with all of you.
3153660	3155660	He's getting a jerk off.
3155660	3156660	Yeah.
3156660	3157660	Meh.
3157660	3158660	Meh.
3158660	3159660	Computer.
3159660	3162660	What's up, man?
3163660	3166660	Give me super bad powers.
3166660	3169660	Oh, okay.
3169660	3171660	Uh...
3171660	3172660	Yeah, there you go.
3172660	3173660	Look at that.
3173660	3174660	That's not your step-sister.
3174660	3175660	Meh.
3175660	3176660	What?
3176660	3178660	No, no, no.
3178660	3179660	I was...
3179660	3180660	Uh-oh.
3180660	3183660	Oh, baby bad.
3183660	3186660	I went to the wrong booth.
3186660	3187660	Oh, it happens.
3187660	3190660	I'll see you later.
3190660	3192660	Is someone on the right?
3192660	3194660	I'm going to this other booth.
3194660	3195660	All right.
3195660	3199660	Hey, you built two of me.
3199660	3200660	One more to the right.
3200660	3202660	I get it.
3202660	3204660	All right.
3204660	3207660	Look.
3207660	3209660	Nobody wants me to be Batman anymore.
3209660	3210660	No.
3210660	3211660	Any more than I want to keep doing it.
3211660	3212660	Right.
3212660	3214660	You guys are bringing me comedy sandwiches.
3214660	3216660	Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
3216660	3219660	I got villains pulling their cars backwards.
3219660	3220660	Can I be honest?
3220660	3222660	I should have stolen bread.
3222660	3226660	Bacon, you can do it out, but bread's kind of like...
3226660	3229660	Bread's kind of the whole point of a sandwich.
3229660	3231660	If I were a good sandwich villain,
3231660	3234660	I would have taken the bread.
3234660	3236660	I don't want to fight you.
3236660	3239660	I want you to be the new Batman.
3239660	3241660	Bacon Man.
3241660	3242660	Here's the keys.
3242660	3243660	Stop calling.
3243660	3244660	This is Alfred.
3244660	3245660	He's going to work for you.
3245660	3246660	What are you doing?
3247660	3249660	I'm not calling it Bacon Man.
3249660	3252660	Here's the $500 an hour.
3252660	3253660	Here's the, what do you call it?
3253660	3255660	The pink slip to my vehicles.
3255660	3259660	Pink slip for the pink dress you wear?
3259660	3261660	Here's my talking sandwich.
3261660	3264660	I called Bacon Pink Slips.
3267660	3270660	In case you wanted to know that.
3270660	3271660	He just said it.
3271660	3272660	Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
3272660	3274660	I'm going to Sardinia.
3274660	3275660	Sardinia?
3275660	3278660	That's underwater.
3278660	3279660	Splash.
3279660	3280660	Splash.
3280660	3283660	Blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub.
3283660	3285660	Under the sea.
3285660	3287660	Under the sea.
3287660	3288660	I used to be Batman.
3288660	3291660	Just so you know, this is the second funniest thing.
3291660	3293660	Under the sea.
3293660	3295660	It needed no explanation, but we just...
3295660	3296660	Under the sea.
3296660	3297660	That's awful.
3297660	3298660	Under the sea.
3298660	3299660	I used to be Batman.
3299660	3300660	I used to be Batman.
3300660	3301660	Under the sea.
3301660	3302660	All right.
3302660	3303660	You're still here.
3303660	3305660	Under the sea.
3305660	3306660	All right.
3306660	3308660	Here I am in Sardinia.
3308660	3309660	All right.
3309660	3311660	I'm a tiny fish.
3311660	3312660	Fuck.
3312660	3314660	We fucked up.
3317660	3320660	I'm a talking man.
3321660	3322660	Fucked up.
3322660	3323660	Fucked up.
3323660	3324660	Okay.
3324660	3326660	That's my lover.
3326660	3327660	All right.
3327660	3328660	Look, the two of you.
3328660	3329660	Don't.
3329660	3331660	You could look at him too in the eye.
3331660	3333660	Yeah, you don't have to be weird.
3333660	3336660	I'm a very rich man.
3336660	3338660	I'd like the two of you to help me dig a cave.
3338660	3339660	Okay, yeah, yeah.
3339660	3341660	We can work here both sides.
3341660	3342660	Yeah.
3342660	3344660	Help me dig a cave.
3344660	3345660	Oh, yeah.
3345660	3346660	We'll do that.
3346660	3347660	Yeah.
3347660	3349660	I'd like to hook up some computer equipment
3349660	3352660	just to keep track of what's going on in the outside world.
3352660	3353660	Well, we don't like that.
3353660	3354660	No.
3354660	3355660	No.
3355660	3356660	No.
3356660	3357660	No.
3357660	3358660	Okay.
3358660	3359660	Honey.
3359660	3360660	No.
3360660	3361660	I don't want to do it.
3361660	3362660	All right.
3362660	3363660	Well, I'll do it.
3363660	3364660	I'll do it.
3364660	3365660	All right.
3365660	3366660	Bye.
3366660	3367660	I'm going to watch him.
3367660	3368660	Fucking shit.
3368660	3369660	Fucking don't need anybody.
3369660	3372660	Fucking got scared of bats after my parents died.
3372660	3373660	I don't care.
3373660	3375660	I don't need anybody.
3375660	3376660	I don't need anybody.
3376660	3378660	I never needed anything.
3378660	3380660	Dig a big enough hole.
3380660	3382660	Hi.
3383660	3385660	Hello.
3385660	3387660	Hi.
3387660	3388660	Where's he sleeping?
3388660	3389660	Why is he sleeping?
3389660	3390660	I don't need anybody.
3390660	3391660	I don't need anybody.
3391660	3396660	Where's the ghost of the ocean?
3396660	3398660	Ocean ghost.
3398660	3400660	There's only two of us.
3400660	3401660	Yes.
3401660	3403660	It was a slow year.
3403660	3404660	I don't care.
3404660	3405660	I'm not scared of anything.
3405660	3406660	All right.
3406660	3407660	Bye.
3407660	3408660	Over came my fears.
3408660	3409660	Bye.
3409660	3410660	I don't fear of anything.
3410660	3411660	I don't care.
3411660	3413660	You're going to be missed at the party.
3413660	3414660	Set up one computer.
3414660	3416660	That's all I need.
3416660	3417660	One computer.
3418660	3420660	I'm a little guy in a hole.
3420660	3421660	Government accessed.
3424660	3427660	Computer, tell me what's going on.
3428660	3429660	Doesn't matter.
3429660	3430660	I don't care.
3430660	3432660	The high is 93.
3432660	3433660	It's fine.
3433660	3434660	That's good.
3434660	3435660	I like it.
3435660	3436660	It's a 93 high.
3436660	3437660	I don't need to fight it.
3437660	3438660	It's good.
3438660	3439660	Sounds good.
3439660	3440660	I love it.
3440660	3441660	Forest area is very dry.
3441660	3443660	I love being in my cave and nothing happening.
3443660	3445660	Hey, can I plug my laptop?
3446660	3447660	You can't be down here.
3447660	3448660	No.
3448660	3449660	Sorry.
3449660	3452660	You might have plugged my laptop in right next to you.
3452660	3453660	Sorry.
3453660	3454660	The outlet's over there.
3454660	3455660	I'm sitting over here.
3455660	3456660	I know.
3456660	3457660	I'm sorry.
3457660	3458660	Do you mind if I just...
3458660	3460660	I got to go between your legs and do it.
3460660	3461660	Okay.
3461660	3462660	Go ahead.
3462660	3463660	You can plug it in yourself.
3463660	3464660	You're not supposed to...
3464660	3465660	Yeah.
3465660	3466660	I dug a hole because I didn't want anyone to...
3466660	3471660	Well, I got a copy, so I got just as much right to be here as you do.
3472660	3473660	Go ahead.
3473660	3474660	Plug in your...
3474660	3475660	All right.
3475660	3476660	Go ahead.
3476660	3477660	Sorry.
3477660	3478660	My head's pretty big, so...
3478660	3479660	Go ahead.
3479660	3480660	Knock yourself out.
3480660	3481660	Goodbye.
3481660	3482660	I'm a...
3482660	3483660	Fuck it.
3483660	3484660	I'm leaving.
3484660	3485660	I'm leaving.
3485660	3486660	I'm leaving.
3486660	3487660	You forgot your...
3487660	3488660	I didn't forget anything.
3488660	3489660	Bag.
3489660	3490660	I don't care.
3490660	3491660	I can dig another hole.
3491660	3492660	I don't care.
3492660	3493660	Beep, beep.
3493660	3494660	Get the fuck out of the road.
3494660	3495660	Oh, man.
3495660	3496660	Stupid road.
3496660	3497660	I'm out of the road.
3497660	3498660	Fucking assholes.
3498660	3499660	God damn it.
3499660	3500660	Meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.
3500660	3501660	Fuck off.
3501660	3504660	I was Batman once.
3504660	3505660	All right.
3505660	3508660	I'm digging a hole in this field.
3508660	3509660	Dig down.
3509660	3510660	Dig down.
3510660	3513660	I'm a field mouse.
3513660	3514660	So what?
3514660	3515660	Just say hi, bye.
3515660	3516660	Okay, fine.
3516660	3517660	Bye.
3517660	3519660	Like, if you were scary, maybe I'd pattern like...
3519660	3520660	You said field, hi, bye.
3520660	3521660	No, I don't...
3521660	3522660	What?
3522660	3523660	I don't care.
3523660	3524660	Animals can't talk.
3524660	3525660	Tink.
3525660	3526660	Tink.
3526660	3527660	Oh.
3527660	3528660	Tink.
3528660	3529660	Tink.
3529660	3531660	I'm trying to dig in a...
3531660	3532660	What is this?
3532660	3533660	It's a metal box.
3533660	3540660	Pull it up to the surface of this field in the middle of Sardinia on the other side of
3540660	3543660	a freeway.
3543660	3549340	It's just a featureless chrome box.
3549340	3550340	That's right.
3550340	3554100	It's a chrome box.
3555100	3563100	It's a very practical laptop alternative.
3563100	3568100	Oh, hey, should I go?
3568100	3571900	Sorry, I just saw you looking at the chrome box.
3571900	3573100	You know what this is?
3573100	3574100	Yeah, I...
3574100	3575100	Yeah.
3575100	3577580	You're the coffee guy.
3577580	3579460	You followed me.
3579460	3580980	You recognize this chrome box?
3580980	3584620	I think we switched chargers earlier and...
3584620	3585620	You followed me.
3585620	3586620	No, I was looking...
3586620	3587620	Yeah.
3587620	3588620	It's all right.
3588620	3592580	I could use a guy like you in my new lower budget Batman career.
3592580	3594180	All right, well...
3594180	3596020	Do you know how to work a chrome box?
3596020	3599300	Yeah, of course, everybody does.
3599300	3601220	It boots up in six seconds or less.
3601220	3607660	Okay, start it up and, I don't know, I'm gonna...
3607660	3609180	You're bailing out on the bit already?
3609180	3610180	No.
3610980	3612300	What do you mean, already?
3612300	3614300	It's been 40 minutes.
3614300	3617780	Well, it just seems like once I entered the bit, you were like, I don't know.
3617780	3618780	Look, I'm not...
3618780	3619780	No, I don't want to be that guy.
3619780	3622460	It's like, I refuse to be that guy.
3622460	3624220	I'm not gonna be like, oh, that's not to my linking.
3624220	3625220	I fucking bail.
3625220	3626220	I'm saying yes.
3626220	3628340	So, you're not just, Andy, my information for the scene.
3628340	3629340	Yeah, you liked...
3629340	3630740	I pulled out a chrome box.
3630740	3631740	You're like, that's a chrome box.
3631740	3632740	I know what that is.
3632740	3635180	Fucking, you deal with it.
3635180	3637620	I'm gonna walk over there 10 feet.
3637620	3638820	I'm not bailing.
3638820	3640740	I'm walking over there 10 feet.
3640740	3644620	Can you bring back information that helps me with my comedy later?
3644620	3646620	Yeah, all right, okay, yeah.
3646620	3648140	Yeah, I'll do that.
3648140	3649660	Well, don't go too far.
3649660	3650660	I brought my friend.
3650660	3651660	Yeah, count my steps.
3651660	3652660	Hi, my name's Eric.
3652660	3653660	Hi, Eric.
3653660	3654660	Hi.
3654660	3659940	I'm Batman, or I used to be, and I wish I miss it so much.
3659940	3660940	Don't go too far.
3660940	3664060	Step, step, step, step, step, step, step.
3664060	3665220	Wait, where are you going?
3665220	3666660	I'm walking 10 feet away.
3666660	3669660	This is the second funniest thing, dude.
3669660	3670660	You have to...
3670660	3671660	I found a twig.
3671660	3673260	You have to justify it.
3673260	3674260	I found a twig.
3674260	3675260	Is that...
3675260	3676260	Does that help you with your Chromebook bit?
3676260	3678260	It seems like you're bailing out.
3678260	3679260	No, I'm not.
3679260	3681260	I'm supporting your bit.
3681260	3682420	Hey, I'm sorry.
3682420	3684260	I didn't think you'd be like this.
3684260	3685260	It's okay.
3685260	3686260	I just...
3686260	3691380	You know, it took me a long time to drive here tonight.
3691380	3693380	I think he's in a mood, honestly.
3693380	3694380	I don't...
3694380	3696100	He didn't like that chrome stuff.
3696100	3706460	Batarang, set AI position to knocking out two adult males and then positioning their
3706460	3712740	bodies ass up over two wood stumps.
3712740	3715620	Anyway, I think he's a good guy, ultimately.
3715620	3723540	It's not my fault if your pants come down.
3723540	3738020	Boom, boom, international waters, bitch.
3738020	3740020	My father was a success.
3740020	3745580	I could never be like him.
3745580	3747820	My parents weren't even killed outside of theater.
3747820	3751140	I made that up.
3751140	3754180	They died of diabetes.
3754180	3755980	I told everybody they got mugged.
3755980	3757940	I just wanted to be special.
3757940	3759940	I was doomed from the beginning.
3759940	3762500	I'm a victim of privilege.
3762500	3763500	I just want to come.
3763500	3764500	Hey, I woke up...
3764500	3765500	When...
3765500	3774140	I mean, you could just ask.
3774140	3776140	Tell all your friends about me.
3776140	3778140	Poof.
3779140	3782140	I'll have what he's having.
3782140	3783140	All right, there we go.
3783140	3784140	There was...
3784140	3785140	The second...
3785140	3786140	That was the second funniest...
3786140	3787140	The second funniest...
3787140	3788140	That was the second funniest thing.
3788140	3789140	See, I thought...
3789140	3790140	How did we count that?
3790140	3791140	I thought they would get shorter.
3791140	3792140	I thought that the...
3792140	3796140	I think I've just seen clips of it over the years.
3796140	3801140	I felt like as the list progressed that it would get like, oh, well, we don't need that
3801140	3803140	explained.
3803140	3805140	But it turned out that one needed the most explanation.
3805140	3807140	Why was it called Batmobile Sandwich?
3807140	3812140	It seemed like that didn't have a lot to do with it.
3812140	3817140	And it turns out the reason it's funny is because Batman is a predator.
3817140	3818140	Yeah.
3818140	3819140	No, he wants to...
3819140	3825140	How deep did he swim until he found a freeway down there?
3825140	3827140	I did find a lot of it resonant.
3827140	3832140	I liked that he was an isolated person who kept seeking space and the more he got the
3832140	3833140	more he needed.
3833140	3835140	I thought that was very important to, like, study.
3835140	3836140	I'm like, oh, yeah, actually...
3836140	3841140	I thought it was cool when he was fucking that guy in the ass.
3841140	3843140	Well, you would.
3843140	3844140	That's gauche.
3844140	3851140	I understood why they put that in there, but I wasn't, like, into it.
3851140	3853140	Like, I wasn't like, ooh.
3853140	3854140	Like, I got it.
3854140	3856140	I thought that was cool.
3856140	3862140	I want to know more about the consortium of people that decide what's the funniest thing,
3862140	3866140	because that's strangely the second funniest thing of all time.
3866140	3868140	It is, isn't it?
3868140	3869140	Yeah.
3869140	3870140	It just took that long to...
3870140	3875140	Okay, well, I guess it's about that time.
3875140	3876140	What time is that, Dan?
3876140	3879140	It's time to unveil the first funniest thing.
3879140	3882140	Right after this commercial break.
3882140	3885140	Do you have an ear?
3885140	3888140	Yeah, who doesn't?
3888140	3891140	Is it about time to get it checked out?
3891140	3893140	Hey, I have your ears.
3893140	3898140	I'm on one side of your head, and I'm on the other side of your head.
3898140	3900140	And I'll tell you one thing.
3900140	3902140	Both of us are unhappy.
3902140	3903140	Well, come down...
3903140	3904140	Oh, sorry, go ahead.
3904140	3905140	No, go, go.
3905140	3906140	No, you guys go.
3906140	3907140	No, let me go.
3907140	3908140	No, wait, let me go.
3908140	3909140	No, I'm here to listen.
3909140	3910140	No, I want to go.
3910140	3911140	No, my job is to listen.
3911140	3912140	We're all ears here.
3912140	3915140	I hear what you're doing.
3915140	3916140	You go ahead.
3916140	3918140	You talk, I'll listen.
3918140	3919140	I'm ears.
3919140	3920140	Has this happened to you?
3920140	3922140	What?
3922140	3924140	Do you have earitis?
3924140	3930140	If your head's covered with ears, all of them want to hear each other.
3930140	3933140	And it can actually accomplish the opposite effect.
3933140	3939140	Call 1-8-8-300-EER-PIRE!
3939140	3942140	Dumb, so dumb.
3942140	3945140	Uh...
3945140	3946140	Right.
3946140	3948140	Yeah, okay, yeah.
3949140	3951140	That was a commercial.
3951140	3952140	EER-PIRE!
3952140	3953140	Yeah.
3953140	3956140	We hear, we hear, we hear.
3956140	3958140	That's where you should have gone.
3958140	3959140	I like what I did.
3959140	3960140	No, it's a safety.
3960140	3967140	Well, if you're just tuning in, we're coming up on the 10 Funniest Things Countdown.
3967140	3969140	And that was a word from our sponsor.
3969140	3971140	Dan, real quick.
3971140	3974140	Recap the top...
3974140	3975140	The top nine.
3975140	3978140	Recap the top nine for us and bring us up to number one.
3978140	3982140	Yeah, 10, of course we can all remember, was...
3982140	3983140	The least funny.
3983140	3984140	Yeah.
3984140	3987140	And it's funny to remember those days...
3987140	3988140	Right.
3988140	3990140	...when...
3992140	3993140	Dog tripping over time.
3993140	3994140	Dog tripping?
3994140	3995140	Dog tripping.
3995140	3996140	Yeah, dog tripping.
3996140	3998140	Number nine, of course, is...
3998140	4003140	Oh, sorry, I got addicted fast to the audience remembering.
4003140	4005140	They're like, nope, don't remember that one.
4005140	4007140	Blacked out during that one.
4007140	4009140	Something's about schools.
4009140	4010140	The Macarena.
4010140	4012140	The Macarena was number nine.
4012140	4015140	Rabbit television, I think, was number seven.
4015140	4017140	Number...
4017140	4018140	Wait, we...
4018140	4020140	Racist bus driver, of course, was number six.
4020140	4021140	Wait.
4021140	4022140	That was like five or six.
4022140	4024140	Yeah, I think that was five.
4024140	4025140	Wait, what's that?
4025140	4027140	Baby with a mustache.
4027140	4028140	Baby with a mustache.
4028140	4029140	Yeah.
4029140	4031140	Which we just skipped over.
4031140	4032140	Nobody wanted to touch that.
4032140	4033140	Nobody wanted to touch that.
4033140	4034140	We did it.
4034140	4035140	The baby...
4035140	4036140	Aardvark School, of course.
4036140	4037140	Aardvark School.
4037140	4038140	Who could forget Aardvark School?
4041140	4043140	Bammable sandwich.
4043140	4045140	And then, of course, Bammable sandwich.
4045140	4046140	Bammable sandwich.
4046140	4048140	At number two, the penultimate.
4050140	4052140	Which brings us now to the number one...
4052140	4053140	To the much-vaunted...
4053140	4054140	Funniest thing.
4054140	4055140	Number one.
4055140	4056140	The funniest thing.
4056140	4057140	It's the funniest thing.
4057140	4058140	Just to let everyone know.
4058140	4059140	Not of the year.
4059140	4060140	No.
4060140	4061140	Of period.
4061140	4062140	Not of the podcast.
4062140	4063140	No, no.
4063140	4064140	Just empirically the funniest thing.
4064140	4065140	Of the human race.
4065140	4066140	Yes.
4066140	4067140	And we all...
4067140	4068140	The funniest thing has ever happened.
4068140	4069140	We all know it.
4069140	4070140	Everybody in the audience knows it.
4070140	4071140	We all know it on stage.
4071140	4072140	Yeah.
4072140	4073140	We should all say it together.
4073140	4074140	Let's all say it at the same time.
4074140	4075140	Let's all say it.
4075140	4076140	Three, two, one.
4076140	4077140	Three, two, one.
4077140	4079140	The Fox Animated Series, Alan Gregory.
4079140	4080140	That's right.
4080140	4081140	Yeah.
4081140	4082140	It's hard because we're not...
4082140	4084140	The audience isn't mic'd, so it's hard to really...
4084140	4087140	I heard Gregory.
4087140	4088140	You're Gregory.
4088140	4089140	And that's what it was.
4089140	4090140	It was Gregory.
4091140	4092140	It was Gregory.
4092140	4094140	That's the one thing I heard ring out.
4094140	4101140	I heard one person like shoot out real fast when we were on the one of three, two, one.
4101140	4102140	Pazuki!
4102140	4103140	Which was a good instinct.
4103140	4104140	Shout out to you.
4104140	4107140	And then the last thing I heard was Gregory.
4107140	4111140	And so you're rewarding the bad instinct of Gregory.
4111140	4112140	I want to...
4112140	4113640	I want to applaud both of them.
4113640	4117740	I think they're both great people because they're trying to make the show fun.
4117740	4119140	Because they want to have fun.
4119140	4120140	They...
4120140	4121140	They...
4121140	4123140	It's their heroes.
4123140	4124140	Gregory.
4124140	4126140	The funniest thing.
4126140	4127140	Yeah.
4127140	4132140	And if you don't know why...
4132140	4133140	Gregory.
4133140	4140140	I mean, yeah, if you know him, goddamn.
4140140	4143140	Fuck, that guy won't let up, you know?
4143140	4147140	I think Gregory's kind of an all-purpose place holder for jokes.
4147140	4149140	Like Gregory walks into a thing.
4149140	4150140	Sure, sure.
4150140	4153140	But this is the greatest Gregory joke of all time.
4153140	4154140	Yeah.
4154140	4155140	Yeah.
4155140	4157140	And we don't even need to say it.
4157140	4161140	We all know the joke about Gregory and the barn.
4161140	4162140	Yes, we do.
4162140	4163140	Yes, we do.
4163140	4164140	And the barn...
4164140	4165140	It's the number one funniest thing.
4165140	4167140	The old barn Gregory joke.
4167140	4168140	Oh, yeah.
4168140	4169140	Okay.
4169140	4170140	Yeah.
4170140	4171140	Oh!
4171140	4173140	Oh, Gregory!
4173140	4176140	Oh, you're going to do it?
4176140	4181140	No, I'm reacting like a British grandma hearing the joke for the first time.
4181140	4183140	Yeah, I hate it.
4183140	4185140	Yeah, Gregory goes...
4185140	4187140	He goes to the barn.
4187140	4188140	He goes to the barn.
4188140	4189140	And he doesn't have his...
4189140	4191140	To the barn or the bar?
4191140	4192140	The barn.
4192140	4193140	Barn.
4193140	4194140	Barn.
4194140	4195140	Barn!
4195140	4196140	Okay.
4196140	4197140	He doesn't have a saddle.
4197140	4198140	Doesn't have a saddle.
4198140	4199140	He needs a saddle.
4199140	4200140	Or he says no saddle.
4200140	4202140	Oh, that's a Gregory joke.
4202140	4203140	Gotcha.
4203140	4204140	Yeah.
4205140	4207140	It's the Gregory joke.
4207140	4208140	The Gregory.
4208140	4210140	Gregory's kind of like an American Belmont.
4210140	4211140	Oh, Belmont.
4211140	4212140	Yeah.
4212140	4213140	Needs a saddle.
4213140	4216140	We have built up an expectation that we can never...
4216140	4217140	What are you talking...
4217140	4218140	What?
4218140	4219140	What?
4219140	4220140	It's the funniest...
4220140	4221140	It's the number one funniest thing.
4221140	4223140	Goes door to door looking in the...
4223140	4224140	Right.
4224140	4225140	Do you have my saddle?
4225140	4226140	Do you have my saddle, right?
4226140	4227140	Do you have my saddle?
4227140	4229140	Like, et cetera, et cetera.
4229140	4230140	Comedy comes in threes.
4230140	4231140	Goes to the first house.
4232140	4234140	I have a saddle, but it's too small.
4234140	4236140	The first guy's Irish.
4236140	4237140	The first guy's Irish.
4237140	4238140	He's Irish.
4238140	4242140	I'd love to give you a saddle.
4242140	4247140	But my wee mare needs the saddle,
4247140	4250140	and its back is too skinny.
4250140	4256140	And the saddle won't fit if I give it to you.
4256140	4258140	So he goes to the second barn.
4258140	4260140	It's a Jewish barn.
4260140	4262140	It's a Jewish, but he's from South Africa.
4262140	4264140	He's a South African Jew.
4264140	4266140	A South African Jew.
4266140	4268140	Yeah, the saddle is...
4268140	4271140	But he's a perfect South African Jewish, actually.
4271140	4272140	Absolutely, yeah.
4272140	4274140	And as Gregory says,
4274140	4277140	Hello, hello, I'm Gregory.
4279140	4282140	Do you have my saddle, dude?
4282140	4286140	And the South African Jewish person says,
4287140	4289140	in a perfect...
4289140	4291140	Rob, you usually do this part.
4294140	4296140	Well, you normally do it.
4296140	4298140	You normally do it in the room.
4303140	4305140	No, you're always doing it in the room.
4305140	4307140	On phone calls, you're always doing it.
4308140	4312140	The number one funniest thing.
4313140	4315140	Where is he?
4315140	4318140	He just took his microphone.
4320140	4321140	Yeah, okay.
4321140	4323140	So the second one's like,
4323140	4325140	No, I don't have your saddle.
4326140	4330140	And they say it in a very, very South African way.
4330140	4331140	Oh, a very colorful way, yes.
4331140	4333140	With a touch of...
4333140	4335140	South.
4336140	4337140	A little Yiddish in it.
4337140	4340140	So you get your South African, you get your Yiddish...
4341140	4343140	Yeah, it's beautiful.
4344140	4346140	If you heard it, you'd be like...
4346140	4347140	You'd know it.
4347140	4348140	Bing!
4348140	4351140	I know where that person's from and what religion they worship.
4352140	4354140	And it's totally appropriate.
4354140	4356140	And we all know the joke, so we don't have to go through it.
4356140	4357140	We don't have to go through it.
4357140	4358140	It's a waste of time.
4358140	4359140	Right.
4359140	4362140	The idea is that Gregory keeps going from house to house.
4362140	4363140	He's looking for a saddle.
4363140	4365140	Every house he goes to is...
4365140	4367140	Owned by a different nationality.
4367140	4368140	They have a look at a different reason.
4368140	4369140	They can't give you a saddle.
4369140	4370140	I've got a saddle.
4370140	4371140	It's not the right size.
4371140	4372140	Right.
4372140	4373140	Right?
4373140	4374140	Right.
4374140	4375140	South African Jew is like...
4375140	4376140	Well, Rob can do it.
4376140	4377140	Do it.
4377140	4378140	Do it.
4378140	4382140	Dan, Dan, just give it a try.
4382140	4383140	Give it...
4383140	4385140	Just try your South African...
4385140	4386140	I'll do Gregory.
4386140	4387140	A try.
4387140	4388140	It's so easy.
4388140	4391140	Can you give me a saddle for my horse?
4391140	4393140	And then South African Jew says...
4393140	4394140	Right.
4394140	4395140	Right, mate.
4395140	4397140	I don't have it.
4399140	4401140	Just a South African in it.
4401140	4402140	Right.
4402140	4403140	There you go.
4403140	4404140	Yeah, that's it.
4404140	4405140	So that's...
4405140	4407140	But I mean, that's like kind of a mid-part.
4407140	4408140	So that's like, you know...
4408140	4409140	Right.
4409140	4410140	Yeah, I'm skipping.
4410140	4412140	Okay, so at this point it's pouring rain.
4412140	4413140	Right.
4413140	4414140	And he has no saddle.
4414140	4415140	And he's cold.
4415140	4416140	He's cold.
4416140	4418140	Oh, his horse is gonna...
4418140	4419140	He's got...
4419140	4421140	He goes to the third house.
4421140	4422140	It's the...
4422140	4423140	Oh, God.
4423140	4425140	Well, we all know.
4425140	4426140	Yeah.
4426140	4427140	It's the trap house.
4427140	4429140	It's the...
4429140	4433140	It's Adolf Hitler's house.
4433140	4436140	Adolf Hitler's trap house.
4436140	4437140	Right.
4437140	4438140	Yeah.
4438140	4440140	But he's not there.
4440140	4442140	But who is...
4442140	4445140	No, no, because he died in 1945 or 46.
4445140	4446140	Yeah.
4446140	4448140	But it's still his house.
4448140	4449140	Right.
4449140	4450140	And it is inside...
4450140	4451140	But it's haunted by him.
4451140	4452140	Right, all right.
4452140	4453140	It's haunted...
4453140	4454140	Because he died with unfinished business.
4454140	4455140	Yes.
4458140	4459140	No?
4460140	4461140	Wait.
4461140	4463140	I mean, if you're a Hitler, yeah, I guess.
4463140	4465140	This is the funniest thing.
4465140	4467140	The number one funniest thing.
4467140	4468140	Wait, wait.
4468140	4470140	It's the funniest thing.
4470140	4476140	I don't know if I like the way this joke ended.
4476140	4477140	We did it.
4477140	4478140	Oh, okay, all right.
4478140	4480140	The number one funniest thing, Greg and Reeve.
4480140	4482140	We did the top 10 funniest things.
4482140	4483140	We fucking nailed it.
4483140	4484140	That's it.
4484140	4485140	Yeah.
4486140	4487140	And you know the rest of it.
4487140	4488140	Yeah, it is.
4488140	4490140	He ends up getting his saddle, but not the way he wanted it.
4490140	4493140	It turns out that...
4493140	4495140	He saddled with the most birdie.
4495140	4497140	The European Union is a complicated place.
4497140	4499140	It's a hornet's nest.
4499140	4501140	Shit, man.
4501140	4503140	How's that Brexit going?
4503140	4504140	Is the president dead?
4504140	4506140	He had a pain in his heart?
4506140	4508140	By the time people hear this, maybe.
4508140	4509140	Yeah.
4509140	4511140	They have fascinating conversations with people who...
4511140	4513140	Because I'm like, oh, boy, what a test.
4514140	4516140	The guy's got a pain in his heart.
4516140	4518140	It's a test review.
4518140	4521140	You're not supposed to be a bad person.
4521140	4525140	The whole point of not liking a bad person is you're not supposed to...
4525140	4530140	And I have friends who I want, but they're privately, they're like, no, fuck that.
4530140	4534140	Remember in the Frost Nixon movie when the guy in Frost Nixon,
4534140	4539140	he represented the part of the public that was like, no, fuck this guy's a war criminal.
4540140	4541140	Get him.
4541140	4543140	Anything less than getting him is fucking...
4543140	4545140	That guy.
4545140	4547140	I feel like you just had nine conversations with yourself.
4547140	4550140	And we need one conclusion to any of those.
4550140	4554140	I learned two hours ago that the president had chest pains.
4554140	4555140	I have no...
4555140	4559140	I never even thought that I would have any reason to parse it.
4559140	4561140	I heard he has the best chest and the most wonderful...
4561140	4563140	It's a perfect chest.
4563140	4565140	It's a perfect chest.
4565140	4570140	Nobody wants him to...
4570140	4572140	We all want him to...
4572140	4573140	It's complicated.
4573140	4576140	You want him to die, but also you want him to pay.
4576140	4577140	Yep.
4577140	4578140	That's the trick.
4578140	4579140	I immediately...
4579140	4582140	The Wisconsin of me immediately leaps to like, you're being tested.
4582140	4584140	This is how you're tested.
4584140	4586140	You're not supposed to ever...
4586140	4589140	You can't.
4589140	4590140	That's the whole point.
4590140	4593140	If you ever judged anybody, then if they're like,
4593140	4596140	ow, my foot, you're supposed to be like, whoa.
4596140	4597140	Wisconsin nice.
4597140	4600140	Yeah, which is largely passive aggressive.
4600140	4602140	But it is a test.
4602140	4604140	Everything's a test.
4604140	4607140	What do you mean?
4607140	4611140	I know the reason you're asking me that is to find out whether or not I'm a bad person.
4611140	4612140	Oh, yeah.
4612140	4618140	That's the whole reason I've been on the show.
4618140	4621140	It finally comes out.
4622140	4623140	Isn't that the ultimate thing?
4623140	4624140	We've never...
4624140	4631140	Our generation, and I'm saying our generation in the broadest sense, we've never had a Nixon.
4631140	4636140	Isn't it a crazy thing to have a historical president and to have them be old enough that
4636140	4638140	they would go like, ow, my arm hurts.
4638140	4639140	I'm going to the hospital.
4639140	4645140	And for everybody to check in for a second and go, where do you stand in the world of
4645140	4653140	like, I'm so in favor of goodness or things happening to good people that...
4653140	4660140	Are you willing to hope that ill health befalls another human being?
4660140	4661140	I am.
4661140	4663140	I love it.
4663140	4664140	Oh, yeah.
4664140	4665140	I definitely am.
4665140	4666140	We all definitely are.
4666140	4668140	I hope he has a UTI.
4668140	4672140	Well, that's easy because that just hurts and doesn't kill you.
4672140	4673140	I know.
4673140	4674140	It would be horrible.
4674140	4679140	I guess it's just like...
4679140	4684140	The fear is that he will never die, I think.
4684140	4686140	That's always been a fear.
4686140	4687140	Yeah.
4687140	4688140	Yeah.
4688140	4689140	What time is it?
4689140	4690140	I mean...
4690140	4691140	We're pretty much done.
4691140	4692140	We're doing pretty good.
4692140	4693140	Oh, yeah.
4693140	4694140	We could leave now.
4694140	4695140	Yeah.
4695140	4696140	Okay.
4696140	4697140	I'm just pitching.
4697140	4698140	I'm just pitching, you guys.
4698140	4699140	I'm just trying to come up with ideas.
4699140	4700140	Wait.
4700140	4701140	It's fine.
4701140	4702140	When does he get to just leave?
4702140	4703140	Fire.
4703140	4704140	Let's do that.
4704140	4705140	That's been my question for the whole talk.
4705140	4706140	Let's go see what he's doing back.
4706140	4709020	Let's take the mics back there and see what Jeff's doing.
4709020	4712900	I'm just pitching ideas, you guys.
4712900	4718060	Let's find someone in the audience who, remember the last time I was on it, there was a perfect
4718060	4719060	version of me?
4719060	4720060	There's Pele.
4720060	4721060	The real...
4721060	4722060	Yeah.
4722060	4723060	Let's see if there's a perfect version of Rob.
4723060	4724060	Is Pele here?
4724060	4726060	I didn't think so.
4726060	4729820	Pele's always here because he pays so much attention to the show as you pointed out.
4729820	4730820	Yeah.
4730820	4731820	It was good.
4731820	4733020	I liked him.
4733020	4735180	Let's talk to him again, but he's not here.
4735180	4736780	Is there a perfect Rob, though?
4736780	4738820	Yeah, he's sitting right next to me, baby.
4738820	4739820	Attractive bald?
4739820	4740820	Hell yeah.
4740820	4741820	Any attractive balds in the audience?
4741820	4742820	Right here?
4742820	4743820	A bald number six?
4743820	4744820	Oh, no.
4744820	4745820	All right.
4745820	4746820	But are you attractive?
4746820	4749580	Let's not throw it to the audience, then.
4749580	4752380	I'm getting mixed signals from that.
4752380	4755700	What are you drinking, Dan?
4755700	4757820	Who's come the farthest?
4757820	4758820	Who has the hardest drugs?
4758820	4759820	We got an Australia?
4759820	4760820	DC.
4760820	4761820	DC?
4762540	4763540	Detroit.
4763540	4764540	Milwaukee.
4764540	4765540	Milwaukee.
4765540	4766540	Milwaukee.
4766540	4767540	Milwaukee.
4767540	4768540	The Carolinas.
4768540	4769540	It seems like the Australian-
4769540	4770540	Detroit.
4770540	4771540	The farthest.
4771540	4772540	The Australians have it.
4772540	4773540	Plender, California.
4773540	4777740	Okay, Australia, you want to come up?
4777740	4778740	Yeah.
4778740	4779740	Yeah.
4779740	4780740	We'll just check in with you.
4780740	4781740	Yeah.
4781740	4786820	Let's give a round of applause for Australia.
4786820	4790780	Have a seat on the pube chair.
4791780	4792780	Have a seat on the pube chair.
4792780	4793780	Oh, there's a mic.
4793780	4794780	Oh, my God.
4794780	4795780	This is a dream come true.
4795780	4796780	Nick Rutherford, it's so good to meet you.
4796780	4797780	Oh, great.
4797780	4798780	Again.
4798780	4799780	Yeah.
4799780	4801780	And we didn't- we asked you to come up.
4801780	4803780	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
4803780	4804780	Again?
4804780	4806780	Yeah, I met you yesterday at Doll Swim Fest.
4806780	4807780	Shut the fuck up, man.
4807780	4808780	Yeah.
4808780	4809780	Dream Co-op's amazing.
4809780	4810780	I love it.
4810780	4811780	What's your name?
4811780	4812780	Harrison.
4812780	4813780	Harrison?
4813780	4814780	Oh, yeah, Harrison.
4814780	4815780	That's right.
4815780	4816780	Wait, Dan, I'll take it from here.
4816780	4817780	Tell him again.
4817780	4819780	Dan, what question did you have?
4819780	4820780	No, don't.
4820780	4823780	He won't respect you if you respect him.
4823780	4824780	Oh, okay, cool.
4824780	4827780	That's what we've learned over like seven years.
4827780	4829780	I feel like that's the general consensus.
4829780	4831780	I've known him like seven months and I figured it out.
4831780	4832780	Yeah, I know.
4832780	4833780	I get it.
4833780	4834780	You know, I-
4834780	4835780	Hey, Dan, can you hold up?
4835780	4836780	I'm talking to Harrison.
4836780	4837780	I'm just fucking-
4837780	4839780	It must be nice, man.
4839780	4840780	Like-
4840780	4841780	Yeah, it is.
4841780	4842780	Jeff, how you been?
4842780	4843780	How you doing?
4843780	4844780	That's good.
4844780	4846780	I'm just trying to be friendly.
4846780	4848780	It's real hard.
4848780	4849780	It's hard to be friendly?
4849780	4850780	Yeah, it's-
4850780	4851780	Oh, Spencer, I forgot to shake your hand too.
4851780	4852780	How have you been?
4852780	4853780	Go shake your hand.
4853780	4856780	Yeah, it's so hard to be friendly.
4856780	4857780	I can't blame you for that.
4857780	4858780	How have you been?
4858780	4859780	I'm sorry.
4859780	4860780	I'm quite good.
4860780	4863780	This is probably my last pilgrimage to Harmon Town, so it's quite nice to-
4863780	4864780	Wait, wait, wait.
4864780	4865780	Is something happening?
4865780	4866780	Where are you from, Harrison?
4866780	4867780	Australia.
4867780	4868780	I'm from Sydney.
4868780	4869780	Sydney?
4869780	4870780	Yeah, yeah.
4870780	4871780	So you've come out before?
4871780	4872780	Yeah, this is my sixth time.
4872780	4873780	Whoa.
4873780	4876780	So I've come out every year since 2014.
4877780	4879780	Would you say that tonight's dinkum is fair?
4879780	4881780	It's very fair dinkum, mate.
4881780	4883780	And I wish someone had a hat on.
4883780	4884780	You would like that.
4884780	4887780	I like your hat, Mike.
4888780	4890780	Just so you know.
4891780	4893780	It's fun to panda sometimes.
4893780	4896780	But like, okay, so confirm or deny.
4896780	4897780	Yes, yeah.
4897780	4904780	In your continent, there are spiders so big they can eat birds.
4904780	4905780	Yes, that's true.
4905780	4907780	And they live under your house.
4907780	4910780	But they have very tiny birds in Australia.
4910780	4914780	We literally call them minor birds because they're so small.
4914780	4916780	I made it up, but I guess I was right.
4916780	4918780	So it's a victim-blaming culture there.
4918780	4920780	Yeah, spiders are so rampant.
4920780	4922780	Well, that bird deserved it.
4922780	4923780	Minor birds.
4923780	4925780	Look how small it was.
4925780	4929780	I found over the years, if I go into the facts, the real facts of like, oh yeah, this bloody
4929780	4930780	happens because of this.
4930780	4932780	It's not funny, but I'm just going to agree.
4932780	4933780	Yeah, no, it does.
4933780	4935780	It's a consistent problem.
4935780	4938780	It's a continent full of poison spiders.
4938780	4939780	Isn't it true?
4939780	4940780	Some of them are poisonous.
4940780	4942780	I think that's what Spencer was about to say.
4942780	4945780	Isn't it true that there's a plant that gives you chlamydia?
4947780	4949780	Nobody's going to buy that, man.
4949780	4953780	Again, I have the truth, but it's like, yes, yes, that is the case.
4953780	4954780	I know.
4954780	4956780	It's just because most of our koalas have chlamydia.
4956780	4958780	I mean, that's a fact.
4958780	4962780	Because koalas are always just fucking, they're STD riddled.
4962780	4965780	They're just going for it, and they just basically like...
4965780	4968780	Wait, is it true that Spencer fucked a koala once?
4971780	4974780	The truth is that Spencer just loves gum leaves.
4974780	4976780	That's why he's so sweet all the time.
4976780	4977780	Oh, I'm so sweet.
4977780	4979780	Koalas are endangered, right?
4979780	4983780	Yes, mainly because a good chunk of our country is on fire right now.
4984780	4986780	But also because koalas don't like to fuck.
4986780	4987780	Again, not funny.
4987780	4990780	And that's the 10th funniest thing about Australia.
4990780	4992780	Now give us the ninth.
4992780	4993780	All right.
4993780	4995780	That was the 11th funniest thing.
4995780	4996780	Number nine.
4996780	4999780	We've had five prime ministers in 10 years.
4999780	5000780	Eight.
5000780	5001780	Eight is...
5001780	5002780	That's not a ninth.
5002780	5003780	This is a ninth.
5004780	5005780	Seven.
5008780	5009780	Seven is our Great Barrier Reef.
5009780	5010780	Used to be real colorful.
5010780	5012780	Now it's white.
5012780	5013780	That's hilarious.
5014780	5015780	Not funny.
5015780	5016780	You're fucking...
5016780	5019780	You know how like the toilets go this way up here?
5019780	5021780	Comedy down there goes the other way.
5026780	5028780	Comedy goes the other way.
5029780	5031780	That's not fair to him.
5032780	5034780	That's very funny, but it's not fair to him.
5034780	5035780	But it is fair dinkum though.
5035780	5036780	That is not fair dinkum.
5036780	5038780	That is unfair dinkum.
5038780	5039780	That's true.
5039780	5040780	Why is it dinkum?
5040780	5042780	Why is it dinkum?
5042780	5048780	It's a weird colloquialism we have that just means, yes, that is good.
5048780	5051780	We just make out words all the time because we think we're smart, but we're not.
5051780	5053780	Did you know that all words are made up?
5056780	5057780	God, I love you so much, Smith.
5057780	5061780	It's crazy to think about that.
5061780	5065780	I feel like when we were down there, it was like somebody pointed out.
5065780	5066780	Someone just made it all up.
5066780	5072780	It had to do with Chinese immigrants or something in a way that if you wanted to unravel it,
5072780	5076780	it's offensive, which I only point out.
5076780	5081780	There's every other phrase you can use in America, a cup of joe.
5081780	5083780	Give me some jimmies on my ice cream.
5083780	5088780	Every Uncle Ben, every fucking thing that you say in America
5088780	5092780	somehow reaches back to immediate racism.
5092780	5094780	I think fair dinkum is one of them.
5094780	5096780	I would not be surprised.
5096780	5098780	I would Google it, but there's no Wi-Fi.
5098780	5100780	I'm never going to say it on camera.
5103780	5104780	Dinkum?
5104780	5107780	If it's fair dinkum, there has to be the opposite.
5107780	5108780	Yeah.
5108780	5110780	Which is unfair dinkum.
5110780	5113780	Unfair dinkum means go fuck yourself.
5113780	5114780	Basically, yeah.
5114780	5118780	But we have phrases for that like, I'm not here to fuck spiders.
5120780	5122780	You have a phrase for that?
5122780	5124780	If you are dead serious about something.
5124780	5125780	Is that the phrase?
5125780	5127780	That's the phrase.
5127780	5131780	If you sell something on Facebook marketplace and they're like,
5131780	5132780	you got the bike pump?
5132780	5134780	And they're just like, yeah, I'm not here to fuck spiders.
5134780	5136780	Then you exchange money and then you get the bike pump.
5136780	5139780	So that means that at some point somebody was there to fuck spiders.
5139780	5143780	Well, yeah, it's an important phrase because so many people in Australia
5143780	5145780	are there to fuck spiders.
5145780	5147780	I'm not here to fuck spiders.
5147780	5148780	Yes.
5148780	5150780	Meaning like, let's talk turkey.
5150780	5152780	Let's fucking get down to brass tacks.
5152780	5153780	Yeah.
5153780	5154780	All right.
5154780	5155780	Okay, I love that one.
5155780	5156780	I'm using that all the time.
5156780	5157780	You guys didn't hear that.
5157780	5159780	You went through like, I think it was like four or five different cities
5159780	5160780	and that did not come up once.
5160780	5161780	Yeah, no, that's amazing.
5161780	5164780	Well, they were there to fuck spiders.
5164780	5166780	They never had to use those words.
5166780	5167780	That's true.
5167780	5170780	I was too busy fucking all those spiders.
5170780	5171780	They're big enough to fuck.
5171780	5174780	Because Americans get off the plane and they're going, where are the spiders?
5174780	5178780	And I think Australians are like, well, don't upset them.
5178780	5182780	But it's weird because like a lot of us do have an innate arachnophobia.
5182780	5183780	You should.
5183780	5184780	Yes.
5184780	5187780	Because you're the Australians that survived to reproduce.
5187780	5190780	You must be afraid of spiders or you'd be dead.
5190780	5191780	Back home, I have it.
5191780	5194780	Every time I've come here, I've been in an Airbnb where I've seen a spider.
5194780	5195780	That's just like a thing.
5195780	5200780	This time I was staying at the Airbnb and a spider crawled out from under the pillow
5200780	5202780	the morning after I slept in the bed.
5202780	5203780	In America?
5203780	5204780	Yeah.
5204780	5205780	No.
5205780	5208780	I'm worried I brought them here to fuck them.
5208780	5209780	I would accept it.
5209780	5213780	I would have sucked that spider off so quick.
5213780	5216780	You're talking about tiny, itty bitty little dime-sized spiders.
5216780	5217780	He was like, yeah, about that size.
5217780	5219780	Yeah, an American spider that knows its place.
5219780	5220780	Yes.
5220780	5221780	Underneath the pillow.
5221780	5229780	You come from the fucking vegemite spiders that are like refrigerator magnet-sized ass,
5229780	5232780	hairy fucking spiders that have like an ostrich in their tooth.
5232780	5233780	And they're like...
5233780	5234780	Oh, we don't have ostriches.
5234780	5235780	We've got emus.
5235780	5240780	But anyways, I miss you guys.
5240780	5242780	I loved being down there.
5242780	5245780	We would love to come back down.
5245780	5252780	Australia has been like so generous to the podcasting culture in America.
5252780	5253780	Oh, that's true, yeah.
5253780	5255780	It was like a weird British invasion.
5255780	5260780	But if there was no invasion, it was like Australia was just like, oh my God, all of
5260780	5263780	you guys with podcasts, please come down here.
5263780	5265780	It's really worth noting how...
5265780	5266780	Just very lonely.
5266780	5268780	That's what it is.
5268780	5269780	Or a singular continent.
5269780	5273780	It's just like, we would listen to New Zealand podcasts, but we know that they're way better.
5273780	5280780	But in turn, now there's a wave of like, there's a ton of amazing Australian podcasts that
5280780	5282780	are because it's like, oh, you got...
5282780	5283780	I don't know.
5283780	5287780	It's just great sportsmanship.
5287780	5294780	So many fringe American podcasters have like gone on tour down in Australia and come back
5294780	5296780	baptized and like feeling confident.
5296780	5301780	Like, I can't believe how many millions of people I can make happy.
5301780	5302780	And then they...
5302780	5303780	Yeah.
5303780	5304780	Anyways, I'm...
5304780	5305780	Sorry.
5305780	5306780	No, you go first.
5306780	5307780	Go ahead.
5307780	5309540	It speaks to sort of the way that we have our culture.
5309540	5312540	We do a lot of stuff that's very DIY, very, very punk.
5312540	5315780	And it's like we invented like the first feature film, which was the history of the killer
5315780	5316780	gang.
5316780	5317780	And it was the same thing with podcasting.
5317780	5322780	Once we knew what we needed was a mic and a guy named Tim with a MacBook Pro.
5323780	5324780	We were like, let's just do it.
5324780	5325780	Let's put all of our audio online.
5325780	5330780	Also, you guys, there's a fucking weird fetish with avocado toast.
5330780	5331780	Oh, yeah.
5331780	5332780	We love it.
5332780	5334780	Your Ava Smash is fucking ready to go.
5334780	5337780	It's great to a point where it is the...
5337780	5342780	And don't tell anyone over 70 this, it's the antithesis of, okay, boomer.
5342780	5346780	Is that it's like anytime you want to throw some shit at millennials, you'll be like,
5346780	5348780	you bloody avocado toast, mate.
5348780	5349780	And you're just like, fuck you.
5349780	5351780	I just want to eat avocado toast.
5351780	5352780	It's not a nice thing.
5352780	5354780	They tried that here for a while.
5354780	5355780	It stuck with us.
5355780	5357780	It didn't land because avocado toast tastes good.
5357780	5359780	So everyone was like, how is this insulting?
5359780	5363780	But if you haven't had an Ava Smash in fucking Sydney, that you haven't had an Ava Smash,
5363780	5365780	you have the little set of crumble in it.
5365780	5366780	You guys still do it.
5366780	5367780	You did pretty good.
5367780	5368780	There's been like two.
5368780	5370780	No, we don't got the same toast that you guys got.
5370780	5371780	It's the secret.
5371780	5372780	It's just damper.
5372780	5373780	That's all it is.
5373780	5374780	Damper?
5374780	5375780	It's the dampness of the toast.
5375780	5376780	No.
5376780	5377780	You got a saga of the toast.
5377780	5378780	It's the type of bread.
5378780	5379780	It's called damper.
5379780	5381780	It's not the same as sourdough, but it's a bit rougher.
5381780	5383780	Where the fuck did Schwab go?
5383780	5390780	How is he just like, he comes on the show and he's just like, I hate being on the show.
5390780	5392780	I don't like being on the show.
5392780	5394780	Dude, the show's over.
5394780	5396780	I want to come on the show.
5396780	5400780	And then he's just like, he just wanders off like my parents on a cruise.
5400780	5402780	Like, where is he?
5402780	5404780	Is he taking shuffleboard lessons?
5404780	5405780	They're swinging.
5405780	5408780	He just got back from my shuffleboard lesson.
5408780	5409780	Yeah.
5409780	5410780	Oh, yeah.
5410780	5411780	Look at the swagger.
5411780	5412780	Oh, yeah.
5412780	5415780	Blade returns to Whistler's lair.
5415780	5416780	Like, what are you?
5416780	5417780	Yeah.
5417780	5418780	I got some new weapons for you.
5418780	5421780	I had to go to the bathroom.
5421780	5422780	Okay.
5422780	5424780	But Robert's good to me.
5424780	5425780	Yeah.
5425780	5426780	Meet this guy.
5426780	5427780	I have to go to the bathroom too.
5427780	5428780	Should I not go?
5428780	5429780	No, no, go.
5429780	5431780	It'll be fucking funny as shit.
5431780	5433780	Is Pele who?
5433780	5435780	Everyone's just pulling their own shit.
5435780	5439780	Wait, is Pele like a character on the podcast now?
5439780	5440780	No.
5440780	5442780	This show's been about nothing.
5442780	5445780	This is like the most insane things I've ever been.
5445780	5450780	Can I just say if Duke Nukem was from Australia, he might say,
5450780	5455780	I'm here to kick ass and fuck spiders and I'm all out of spiders?
5455780	5456780	Because that could be fun.
5456780	5457780	And I'm all out of spiders.
5457780	5458780	That could be fun.
5458780	5459780	Wait, that's a real saying.
5459780	5460780	I'm not here to fuck spiders.
5460780	5461780	I'm not here to fuck spiders, yeah.
5461780	5464780	Meaning like I've got bigger fish to fry.
5464780	5465780	Yeah.
5465780	5467780	You keep bringing up other idioms to replace it.
5467780	5468780	It's quite, it's quite immune.
5468780	5469780	Yeah.
5469780	5475780	But I've got bigger fish to fry means that there's other fish you would fry,
5475780	5476780	but they're too small.
5476780	5477780	Yeah.
5477780	5480780	But I'm not here to fuck spiders is like, I got bigger spiders.
5480780	5482780	I'm not going to fuck those little spiders.
5482780	5483780	No, no, no.
5483780	5486780	But also you've got to fry the fish before the spiders go.
5486780	5487780	I was in Australia.
5487780	5491780	I think that saying means I'm here to fuck larger arachnids.
5491780	5493780	Like, like, like spiders.
5493780	5494780	Like my dick.
5494780	5498780	If your dick is so small that you could fuck a spider, I say, why live?
5498780	5502780	And the fifth funniest thing about Australia is.
5502780	5507780	The fact that we continue to refer to koalas as drop bears to confuse the international
5507780	5508780	community.
5508780	5509780	Drop bears.
5509780	5513180	Drop bears is a huge problem that we have in Australia where they will just basically
5513180	5518220	be in most trees, most dense like brush, and they will drop onto tourists and then just
5518220	5519220	wipe them out instantly.
5519220	5520220	They just get killed.
5520220	5521220	They wipe out the tourists?
5521220	5522220	Yeah, they kill the tourists.
5522220	5523220	And the tourists get chlamydia.
5523220	5524220	Wait, wait, wait.
5524220	5525220	The bears do?
5525220	5527820	Now, this is the lie that we tell bears.
5527820	5528820	Oh, yeah.
5528820	5531020	Don't get underneath the koala because they'll drop on you.
5531020	5532020	No.
5532020	5533020	And then you'll get chlamydia.
5533020	5534020	Oh.
5534020	5535020	Oh.
5535020	5536020	None of it's real.
5536020	5537020	Don't kiss them.
5537020	5538020	You guys.
5538020	5539020	It's the one thing I don't like about you guys.
5539020	5540020	Liars and cheat.
5540020	5541020	Yeah.
5541020	5542020	That's how we ended up there.
5542020	5546300	We were in Australia and I'm like, you guys, a lot of spiders and the guy in the front
5546300	5551580	row is like, 30% of all spiders eating the poison is in it.
5551580	5557460	And I'm like, why would your continent have that statistic at the ready?
5557460	5559780	When we landed, I think it was at Melbourne, Spencer.
5559780	5560780	We landed there.
5560780	5561780	It was Melbourne, Jeff.
5561780	5562780	Yeah.
5562780	5563780	It was roasting out.
5563780	5564780	It was really hot.
5564780	5565780	It was a hot day?
5565780	5566780	It was an antsy roaster.
5566780	5568300	I'm sure I said this before, but we're all in a van.
5568300	5576260	We just got to, it was the first time Spencer had been to Australia, and Spencer goes,
5576260	5577260	hot Canada.
5577260	5578260	Oh, that's so accurate.
5578260	5579260	And that's number four.
5579260	5580260	That's number four.
5580260	5590020	So we're on to the third funniest thing about Australia now.
5590020	5592860	The third funniest thing is just Eric Banner.
5592860	5593860	Eric Banner.
5593860	5595700	Now we're on to the second funniest thing about Australia.
5595700	5596700	Pauline Henson.
5596700	5597700	Yeah.
5597700	5599100	I was, I was going to lean towards Pauline Henson.
5599100	5603140	We've got like at least four or five Australians in the audience, so I feel bad being up here.
5603140	5604140	Yeah.
5604140	5605140	You should.
5605140	5606140	Yeah.
5606660	5608660	It would have been worse if anyone else had been up here.
5608660	5609660	Third funniest Australian in the audience.
5609660	5614580	We did a show at the underground theater at the Sydney Opera House.
5614580	5615580	Yes.
5615580	5622100	We did a couple of shows there, and some woman just stormed the stage and like, were you
5622100	5623100	there?
5623100	5625100	It was about one woman or something.
5625100	5626100	Yes.
5626100	5627100	They were here.
5627100	5628100	She came here.
5628100	5630780	They're like, Jaws 4, the revenge.
5630780	5631780	She followed us.
5631780	5634740	She just comes up and she's like, smile, you son of a bitch.
5635740	5636740	Remember?
5636740	5637740	She was here.
5637740	5638740	Oh, right.
5638740	5639740	She came down the aisle.
5639740	5640740	Yeah.
5640740	5641740	Yeah.
5641740	5645780	But the crowd, oh, what was, it wasn't Melbourne.
5645780	5646780	What was the other one?
5646780	5647780	What was the really?
5647780	5648780	Brisbane.
5648780	5649780	Brisbane.
5649780	5653700	And the Quonset hut thing, like an old, like, like aircraft hanger.
5653700	5654700	Yeah.
5654700	5655700	And we did a show there.
5655700	5657820	The crowd started heckling each other.
5657820	5660100	Yeah, we do that.
5660100	5665100	People got into like, just like interstitial fights, like amongst each other.
5665100	5670500	The show came to a grinding halt while the crowd fucking sorted out their own, like their
5670500	5671500	own battles.
5671500	5674300	I guarantee you, those people became friends the minute the show was done.
5674300	5675300	It was like, you're a cunt.
5675300	5678300	I'm like, yeah, well, that's a beer.
5678300	5679300	That's it.
5679300	5684460	So in Melbourne, there was a big ass theater we played at, and then we went to a bar afterwards
5684460	5688380	and someone said, hey, that dude that was shouting, welcome back, welcome back, come on, come
5688380	5689380	on.
5689460	5695340	Yelling out Jibberish, that dude apparently had like eight or nine drinks before the show
5695340	5697700	and puked in his shoe.
5697700	5700420	And we saw that shoe.
5700420	5705700	He went outside and emptied the puke out of his shoe and got his ass kicked.
5705700	5710020	Because like, what are you doing emptying out your puke-y shoe on the fucking pavement?
5710020	5711020	And he got his ass kicked.
5711020	5718260	Why would you kick his ass after he took all that effort to contain everything bad about
5718260	5719260	him?
5719260	5720260	It's Chinatown, Jake.
5720260	5722900	No, there's fucking Melbourne, baby.
5722900	5724980	Then he may as well puke on the theater floor.
5724980	5726500	That's the lesson he learned.
5726500	5730500	He kept yelling, I'm all alone.
5730500	5735100	And then someone said, like, I saw him drink ten, like, tall beers.
5735100	5736100	I remember that.
5736100	5737700	Yeah, he puked in his shoe.
5737700	5739020	But I didn't remember him getting it.
5739020	5741940	I like the fucking elegance of just saying, I'm not going to puke on the ground.
5741940	5746820	I want to puke in my own footwear and then walk it down to the restroom.
5746820	5748940	He rinsed out his shoe.
5748940	5751100	And then I think he poured it out on the sidewalk.
5751100	5753180	Yeah, Australia's great.
5753180	5754180	I liked it.
5754180	5755180	Yeah.
5755180	5759540	It's a little different down there other than here in the up over.
5759540	5762780	Is that number two?
5762780	5763780	We will cut that out.
5763780	5764780	Okay, sure.
5764780	5769340	I was going to say, number two is shoeys where you drink from your shoe.
5769340	5770340	Oh, no.
5770340	5771340	And that's probably what was happening to that man.
5771340	5772940	That's where he got the idea.
5772940	5773940	Yeah.
5774060	5777140	What's in the fucking Brisbane West Coast massive?
5777140	5778140	Yeah.
5778140	5779220	What's that about?
5779220	5781820	It's basically just a part in the West Coast where it's very large.
5781820	5782820	Why is it massive?
5782820	5785340	Yeah, this is a big part of it.
5785340	5786340	Number one.
5786340	5788700	And number one is Clive Palmer.
5788700	5793620	He's a terrible politician and also a billionaire magnates.
5793620	5794620	Yay.
5794620	5795620	We love those.
5795620	5796620	Yeah.
5796620	5798500	A rich politician.
5798500	5799700	Nice try, Australia.
5799700	5801100	We don't have them up here.
5801100	5806260	He tried to ruin the election by basically having as many seats as possible and the
5806260	5810780	most like inconsiderate candidates as possible.
5810780	5811780	And it worked.
5811780	5812780	It worked.
5812780	5813780	Yeah.
5813780	5815180	So you guys are you guys are Nazi now?
5815180	5816180	Yes.
5816180	5817180	Yeah.
5817180	5818180	Yeah.
5818180	5819180	It's not good.
5819180	5820180	So it's just happening all over the planet.
5820180	5821860	Just everyone's just going Nazi.
5821860	5823820	It's very sad.
5823820	5826420	And there's no one's like increasingly in your friend groups.
5826420	5832500	Do you have friends who are like, oh, I heard the fucking Proud Boys had a fucking party
5832500	5834060	at the Baskin Rabbins.
5834060	5835060	Fuck that place.
5835060	5838620	I don't want 31 flavors or anything.
5838620	5841900	Do you have friends that are increasingly going like, well, I don't know when it's fucking
5841900	5843900	cancel culture's bullshit.
5843900	5844900	I do.
5844900	5845900	What the fuck is this conversation?
5845900	5846900	I just don't like Nazis.
5846900	5847900	What the fuck?
5847900	5849500	When did this happen?
5849500	5850500	Yeah.
5850500	5851500	Yeah.
5851500	5852500	We've got like a lot of people who like that.
5852500	5853500	There's a friend of mine.
5853500	5856380	He has like a, it's like a, like a Facebook team named him and give his number.
5857380	5858380	Yeah.
5858380	5859380	Cancel him.
5859380	5860380	Cancel him.
5860380	5862460	Cause it's the same exact thing.
5862460	5866060	He's got a thing called yelling at racist dogs where he will go to like places that
5866060	5869460	are having like pro fascist, like rallies and shit.
5869460	5870860	And he'll just go and yell at them.
5870860	5871860	And it's very popular.
5871860	5872860	And I love it.
5872860	5873860	The dogs or the humans?
5873860	5874860	Oh, they're humans.
5874860	5875860	They just act like a bunch of fucking dogs.
5875860	5876860	Okay.
5876860	5877860	Yeah.
5877860	5878860	Yeah.
5878860	5879860	I think Cody got me too high.
5879860	5888060	Are you okay?
5888060	5889060	What did you have?
5889060	5891060	How do you know?
5891060	5896980	Nobody threw up any drugs for Rob to do, so if they even got any uppers, toss them up.

5938880	5941680	Rob Shropp, pay your mortgage
5941680	5945880	Take care of cake before she disengages
5945880	5950880	Yo, everyone dies eventually

5963880	5965880	You should
5965880	5967880	Rob Shropp
5967880	5969880	There's no scope
5969880	5972880	There's only underground where we all go
5972880	5974880	Everyone turns to dust
5974880	5976880	It's the only truth you know
5976880	5978880	I'm the devil and all
5978880	5980880	The devil's here to say
5980880	5984880	The devil's always gonna take your fucking soul away
5984880	5986880	I'm waiting down here
5986880	5988880	Underneath the underground
5988880	5990880	Oh, look
5990880	5992880	Look at what I found
5992880	5994880	Rob Shropp
5994880	5996880	What have you ever done?
5996880	5998880	This is the kind of shit
5998880	6000880	I have fun with
6000880	6002880	You're my easel
6002880	6004880	Time for art class
6004880	6007880	It's time to suck down the life force
6007880	6009880	Through your ass
6009880	6011880	Damn

6013880	6016880	Shit
6016880	6018880	Rob Shropp
