0	28080	Hello Atlanta Georgia how are y'all I hope you're well I know I am
28080	34880	oh you did it you came to the right place gentlemen please
34880	40800	Harman town is now in session put your hands together for the mayor of Harman town Dan Harman
40800	57600	thank you thank you God bless you God bless your railroads God bless your your airlines
58480	66040	God bless Coca-Cola God bless AT&T mobility that we are we are in a we are
66040	70760	in a what's called an alpha city Jeff we're in a center of world commerce
70760	78560	Atlanta Georgia this is a gigantic like global it's it's it's been the nexus of
78560	82600	American civilization and and beyond I'm not being it sounds like I'm being
82600	86400	sarcastic doesn't it if I were from here and someone started saying that I go
86400	92160	what's this a setup for like he's gonna take a piss on her faces no I I've been
92160	96720	Wikipediaing you today as I do each city we go through I do a little bit of
96720	101240	research and I was stricken by the history and the the fucking human pain
101240	109120	and the and triumph it's not funny you should laugh we're in a comedy club I'm
109120	112720	happy I say so it makes you laugh but truly like what it's a beautiful
112720	116560	beautiful we're it's the most historical city in the country I'm gonna say that
116560	121480	right now I'm not I'm not an expert what are you basing that on well you know
121480	124680	you'd have to go like well what about Virginia Dan what about Washington DC
124680	130280	fuck politicians this is a the politics is not history history is blood and
130280	135920	humanity this place Atlanta like out of probably out of any city will be to on
135920	140720	this tour maybe out of any city in the country certainly paid the price for the
140720	146720	Civil War conflict like just sat here and got destroyed like like like was
146720	150040	just in the crossfire because it was at the center of all these railroads it was
150040	155600	a strategic location for military operations so you know this guy General
155600	162520	Sherman sounds like kind of a dick move just just because it was on its way to
162520	167680	Savannah right it's just decided Atlanta should be burnt literally to the ground
167680	173920	every scrap of it except for hospitals and churches quote Wikipedia so that
173920	180120	everyone can sit and go dear God and or he'll heal my leg my house is gone and
180120	184120	everything but but it goes beyond that because I think this is really really
184120	187920	really interesting like like I don't know where we'll go and I'm not I'm not a
187920	191120	historian certainly not a Civil War historian but just reading about that
191120	194880	I'm going okay so I bet this place got it the worst out of that whole conflict I
194880	198120	bet the suffering was the worst here like the biggest battles took place
198120	202680	around here that the crossfire was the worst here the place was burnt to the
202680	210000	ground by by what's up to are you is this a rival for who got it worse or you
210000	214920	said or is that like a wounded knee like of Atlanta thing okay well you know what
214920	220760	yes I'm yes thank you I'm not Ken Burns everybody
221360	227780	amazing hey I don't come to where you animate photos and tell you which key
227780	234400	frames to set I'm not I'm not discouraging you calling something out
234400	237320	I'm just I'm just making sure you're maybe agreeing with me or disagreeing
237320	241740	with me if you disagreeing with me shut up for a second okay but but but if
241740	245400	you're agreeing with me hallelujah but but but but I thought the thing I was
245400	249440	stricken by reading about it was okay so it just did the place was just raised by
249440	253880	this by this horrible bloody conflict and then the first to bounce back like
253880	259640	gigantically and and and and just became like the center of commerce again it's
259640	264040	like constantly being punished for being this nexus of civilization and then also
264040	269760	because it is a nexus of civilization like not having the option of being you
269760	275000	know fucked up like it you look at like Flint Michigan and go oh shit what you
275000	278880	know we had an auto plant here and then it closed down that's why you're being
278880	286920	raped right now we're we're in a city that was ordered burnt down by a federal
286920	291680	Empire and then popped right back up again and like a game of whack-a-mole and
291680	296080	be and became not only not only you know not only a commercial Empire but but
296080	302160	also like at the forefront of the New South of progression and they coined this
302160	306480	phrase I don't know where it came from it was your Willy B. Hartsfield was that
306480	311280	his name of those your your mayor from the 40s to the 60s day the 50s when all
311280	315840	that shit was going down Atlanta was this like pocket of fuck this shit like
315840	320120	like let's let's let's make some money and build our houses and like do this
320120	324720	stuff and the phrase too busy to hate got adopted that's I like sort of a
324720	329760	slogan here I don't know if it's how much bullshit it is but I like I caught
329760	334280	my breath a little bit when I read that too busy to hate too busy to hate they
334280	339240	got too much shit to do there's too much reality happening here for them to
339240	343200	engage in the idea that that if you're a black person or white person or if you
343200	346440	you know whatever you're wherever you're leaning it's there's too much shit to
346440	350880	get done too many railroads happening too many planes coming in they got
350880	355200	places to go too much cargo to offload you know too much coke to make too much
355200	360480	AT&T to mobilize and now and now they're also a media empire as well as a lot of
360480	364400	stuff being shot here it's a it's a little and it's not you know there's no
364400	369080	there's no White House here and there's no it's but it's it's it's it's the
369080	375000	cleavage of our country it's it's just drink down deep just take a sharpie pen
375000	380960	and put it right in there you mean like the Rockies and the Appalachians would
380960	384640	be like the titties yeah I didn't think that hard about it I I was just trying to
384640	389120	think of what what it is I didn't want to say vagina because that's like it's
389120	395200	the womb it's the it's the it's a it's a it's a deep dark painful joyful
395200	400360	creative vessel you're really busy on the internet in that bus ride today man
400360	404480	I know it's just the hotel lobby I went down I had a kettle one and I pulled up
404480	409000	Wikipedia I said what is Atlanta and I just I'm in love I we were in Texas you
409000	412760	probably heard me blowing them when we were willing to pass through but I'm not
412760	416480	I'm not did I didn't say oh Texas is great for any reasons I'd say Atlanta's
416480	420440	great like like Texas and I also didn't give a shit about Austin I was like
420440	425360	Texas we're in Texas let's talk about my infatuation with Texas is this we get
425360	427960	to spend some time here actually we were doing an early show because we have to
427960	432000	get out of here cuz Bob Goldway is coming in and then who is awesome but we
432000	435880	get to we actually get to spend the the evening and the night here and and not
435880	438600	have to get up like I'm not get on the bus at the crack of dawn or if we know
438600	442000	4 a.m. or whatever it's awesome yeah yeah I probably have to write some
442000	445200	scripts though I think I think it's like I think Fox and see you have to write
445200	449280	while you're on the road I have to write right now I have to yeah I should
449280	458600	have a laptop out and going fade in Natalie's she's hot but she's smart I'm
458600	461440	feeling very vulnerable over here because in the club tonight I normally
461440	466560	have a little iPad I have a little iPad and I play music and I put rap beats on
466560	470960	so Dan can rap about fucking your mama and and believe me it's gonna happen
470960	478760	tonight as sure as the south will rise again no mama will be unfucked in this
478760	487080	country and frankly he will not give a damn and well my iPad is up there in the
487080	491200	booth and Dustin Marshall our podcast recorders I'm gonna have to call out
491200	496760	audible is like a sideline coach like a and I'm gonna like beat number two so
496760	501120	you're accustomed to a little more control and I'm traveling with Jeff and
501120	504520	I'm getting to know him I've been friends with him for over ten years you
504520	507680	know we've never been through this experience together and I really noticed
507680	511880	a tangible difference today because I I got off the bus and I went to my hotel
511880	517600	room like like Jeff he can't wear this suit all the time like there are moments
517600	521040	when he's like wearing just a sweater but he just looks like this and those
521040	526280	are his vulnerable moments this is how he sleeps wearing what I'm wearing for
526280	532600	the podcast listeners I'm dressed like Jerry Mathers in 1990 like when he when
532600	536360	they were maybe doing fucking around with a new leave it to Beaver show I
536360	542000	I'm like a J crew kind of kind of casual I don't know that I've ever seen you in
542000	546880	this is how Jeff cuts his vegetables and dress like me and sleeps and so we
546880	549360	rolled into the town of Jeff was wearing his little sweater and he's like like we
549360	552360	came to the venue to do the soundcheck and I know that I know this look in his
552360	556160	eyes like just focused and then he opens the door and he's just walking around
556200	560320	like Jeff's Jeff being snooty like no one get in his way let him let him what
560320	563160	what's what's happened and not snooty because I don't think anyone interacted
563160	567720	with you but but I could I cut you a wide path when I see a certain look on
567720	572120	your face and it's a good idea I was like I think what is it what is it and
572120	576000	then I figured out oh he doesn't he's not in his suit he needs to go back get
576000	579600	in his suit here's a sound check and I need a shave you know I'm of the I'm of
579600	584080	the feeling that like I like Frank Sinatra like here don't hear the rules
584080	586960	that you know when you want when you go on stage you shave and you wear a suit
586960	591640	so I I'm the opposite we rolled into the hotel and I was where I was like I'm
591640	594440	gonna go have a drink and then we'll go to the venue and Aaron said you have to
594440	599920	change your clothes you you stink you you look gross your pants are from a
599920	605760	different era of body weight you look like you have a load in your in your
605760	609480	pants I go you just just she brought all this nice clothes just change and I said
609480	613600	I want to have a drink and I actually really said and I wasn't being ironic I
613600	620440	said do you understand that I'm a baby and she and she went yes I do I'm
620440	627640	changing you and she made me put on this seafoam sweater and this these navy blue
627640	631760	pants and I feel great and all this stuff but I meet meanwhile in a different
631760	637720	hotel room you're going my clothes give me my power so we're opposites there I
637720	642560	would have come out here in a diaper and I would have just pooped and I if no one
642560	645680	else had said anything I wouldn't have known it was yeah I mean it's obviously
645680	648120	there's a live crowd but for a podcast I'm surprised you don't just come out in
648120	652040	a bathrobe because like didn't you should you used to show up at Paramount
652040	655840	for community in a bathrobe didn't you yeah yeah he said show up at work in
655840	660680	pajamas like you were like one of those who's the crazy brothers that made the
660680	664000	matrix and the guys who had to just dress on like a crazy yeah yeah I was
664000	672320	kind of like a lazy non-gender Wieckowski brother my I'm just looking at my ever
672320	676400	note notepad here my armpit smelled worse in Louisiana I wanted you guys to
676400	680280	know that I don't know if that's to your credit but I felt like it was like I
680280	684080	felt like the humidity level there like I simply I don't think I could ever live
684080	687480	in anywhere in Louisiana I caught a little bit of that walking past you and
687480	691320	I was like it was like weird it was like a Coachella burning man kind of like
691320	694760	it's got to be a humidity thing like there's certain chemicals in my armpits
694760	698560	that don't evaporate in Louisiana quick enough so you're getting a certain
698560	702840	combination there that drug enforcement checkpoint what the fuck this is a
702840	707880	crazy what were we driving from Texas to Louisiana and there was this sign that
707880	712720	said drug enforcement checkpoint half-mile so everyone freaks out
712720	720520	cuz shocker we've got weed in the bus there's a reason we're not flying like
720520	725160	if we wanted to have to deal with that fucking fucking America for God's sake
725160	728320	by the way the irony is I haven't smoked any yet but I'm just like I'm going on a
728320	733240	tour bus I'm taking my weed that I have a I have a prescription for I get a lot
733240	738800	of anxiety and I live in a great state of California and I and if you're out
738800	741600	there and you want to ruin our life go ahead and follow us and pull us over and
741600	746640	ruin our life but but I there's a drug enforcement checkpoint oh what's that
746640	750800	we're going zip the pockets and rezip them and what are we supposed to do all
750800	754120	right everyone hold your weed and wait until there's flashing lights and then
754120	758120	we'll all flush it together and all this stuff and then nothing happens and
758120	761240	nothing keeps happening and somebody gets on the internet looks it up they
761240	766480	put these signs up they're like tricks and because obviously nothing could be
766480	770480	more unconstitutional than a drug enforcement checkpoint but they put the
770480	778880	signs up and anyone who gets off on the next exit they follow profiling like
778880	783560	they're saying like they figured out a new way to detect also they're looking
783560	786640	for people that are ditching stuff out the window I said like that just maybe
786640	793400	is some enterprising drug addict who just put that sign up I need it got it
793400	799400	need it got it yeah well my I stayed in a handicapped room in Louisiana this was
799400	802920	weird I hope there's there's physically challenged people those walls were thin
802920	806360	I we had we keep getting adjacent rooms and I keep learning like a little bit
806360	810240	about your like you know diurnal patterns and things like that Dan and
810240	814360	Aaron checked in right next to me the wall was razor thin tissue paper thin
814360	824280	and I and the first thing I hear them doing is Dan's going and we open up a
824280	827920	little doors we have the doors that open up like are you you see Jurassic Park in
827920	833280	there yeah cuz I feel like when you get off a tour bus you're like you know it's
833280	837000	very constrictive and like you say everywhere you go like there doesn't
837000	851360	need to be dinosaurs there for it to feel majestic I don't know I feel John
851360	855920	Williams II when I get off of a vehicle and I feel like I'm looking at a
855920	861560	brontosaurus handicap it said handicap room and then there was a button I don't
861560	866720	know I hope there's somebody in the room that is physically I don't know what the
866720	870680	latest phrase is but physically challenged that knows what it means when
870680	875920	you have a handicap room and there's a like a doorbell button outside the hotel
875920	878880	room and it says press it hold for five seconds what happens then can handicap
878880	885120	people just rob me like if you they don't need a key they're not that
885120	888880	special they don't get to just rock they're like a handrail in your shower
888880	892560	or this but no there was nothing the only thing and this is on them not me I
892560	898080	like the air conditioner didn't work so the joke becomes obvious like oh it's a
898080	904840	handicap room that's not my fault that they that they did that this guy's
904840	912600	getting up to leave because he's walking at least well he's walking to his his
912600	917280	crutches and he's gonna throw one at me I know it's serious nothing again
917280	922800	obviously I'm nothing but an advocate of anyone that wants to feel special
922800	925920	about anything sure be Spencer up here to have oh yeah let's get Spencer up
925920	928840	because we're our time we got a we're gonna do a bullet train harm in town for

1045200	1048400	taught me how to play he actually took me through my character sheet which I've
1048400	1051760	never really bothered to learn about and for his trouble I told I taught him a
1051760	1054880	few chords on the ukulele yeah it's beautiful it's great what's happening
1054880	1060680	it's great it's a lot like the city of Atlanta this relationship it just keeps
1060680	1065640	building itself up and then randomly being burnt down by things I did I tell
1065640	1071280	you Jeff that again in 1917 Atlanta was just caught fire just out of sense
1071280	1079760	memory it's just a sad city that just we should be burnt and they just burnt
1079760	1082920	to the ground again and they built it up again what were the circumstances of
1082920	1090480	that I died that someone burns what happened all right that's it we should
1090480	1095400	we should we should journey there also here's the most progressive thing about
1095400	1103480	Atlanta their first race riot 1906 now that's thinking ahead that's that's the
1103480	1107920	way before it was cool yeah I mean you don't even need to have a race riot back
1107920	1111040	that it was like you could just have races just being oppressed and stuff and
1111040	1115000	they had a full-blown riot in 1906 like a bunch of people died this is a this is
1115000	1119040	a this is the the this is a future city they're always they're always looking

1265720	1270120	wasn't me fucking up a rap either that was that house that was that was I did
1270120	1274320	that artistically like like like that was a meta commentary on what Sherman's
1274320	1280080	rap would be like it would be a desire he would be uncoordinated and brutal and
1280080	1285280	and and and the word retarded would be in it because he's an insensitive fucking
1285720	1291280	like lout like like like decking himself in metals he didn't earn he got a butt
1291280	1297880	full of peanut butter he's swarming for me I assume there's like answer coming

1333440	1346480	what happened oh and you just like a brewing rocks and the bullets were
1346480	1352360	faster because it was downhill you guys you just should have just stayed on the
1352360	1362920	mountain yeah I bet yeah see like I'm from
1362920	1365960	Los Angeles like we didn't get a whole lot of Civil War history stuff in our
1365960	1373880	school no it's just like Frank Sinatra date rape someone there the battle of
1373880	1378880	the four-door sedan she wanted to get out he goes she she kept saying no but
1378880	1382920	not quite no and then back then it didn't work and it's like yeah you know
1382920	1387600	and then Sammy said something but then yeah not a lot of history there just a
1387600	1396480	lot a lot a lot a lot of Disney Disney Disney places where Disney ate edit it
1396480	1404800	out all right well we're okay what are we looking at time wise we're gonna for
1404800	1415640	36 5 36 5 36 he's not the time master 6 36 Spencer could you be the voice of the
1415640	1422040	skeleton crotch above me every time I go to the skeleton crotch for those of
1422040	1425240	you listening in podcast land there's a one of the cool things about the room is
1425240	1433680	that there is a full human skeleton poised the crow style above my head with
1433680	1438120	its pelvis directly above my my scalp about to take a calcified shit all over
1438120	1444240	you what do you think about tonight's gig skeleton crotch you look like you're
1444240	1452680	dying and I'm dead he's he's I'm getting heckled by the skeleton crotch
1452680	1461560	he's jealous of your flesh yeah it's 537 all right all right so like like any
1461560	1465080	anything anything else to talk about that uh that I haven't already looked up
1465080	1469800	on my phone I try to I try to we got our angry bus driver we got the drug
1469800	1472960	enforcement we got my armpits among worse in Louisiana we have to get our
1472960	1475720	bus driver on the stage at some point because he's I want to start like
1475720	1478920	creating a constitution for harmontown there's a discussion of this on the on
1478920	1486080	the harmontown forum but I think that like it has to be based on on the rule
1486080	1491560	that that everybody gets to do whatever they want which I think is kind of a it
1491560	1496280	it could theoretically end there because the only exception of that would be if
1496280	1499760	you doing whatever you want gets it the way of someone else doing whatever they
1499760	1505040	want so for instance if I want to punch you in the face like but you don't want
1505040	1509680	to get punched in the face then we have a complication there so so then I then
1509680	1512880	that's where I my brain kind of locks up because I'm not a politician and I
1512880	1518600	don't really we have to we have to fight to the death just any time there's a
1518600	1525720	conflict Tina Turner from Thunderdome is in the back of the room but he didn't
1525720	1528800	want to get punched in the face then all I have to do is come up to him punch him
1528800	1531720	in the face and then he goes I didn't want that and I go well fight to the
1531720	1538320	death that doesn't seem like a nerds paradise that seems like my middle
1538320	1543240	school it seems exactly how that worked there has to be some kind of we'll
1543240	1545840	figure it out and we don't have to figure out here in Atlanta although I
1545840	1549720	can't think of a better place to figure it out like like this is a this is a
1549720	1553240	this is a society that like we were in a place called Phoenix but this is
1553240	1558560	literally a phoenix and not literally this is truly like if there was a city
1558560	1561920	that should be called Phoenix like like like come on keeps burning down and they
1561920	1567840	keep like you know yeah so you guys last time was 1907 or 17 17 so you guys are
1567840	1576200	do you guys are late you're late on a burn down not funny to them not funny to
1576200	1582760	them this Sherman thing is still pretty fresh to it I guess it's a pretty it's
1582760	1589120	an open wound here well yeah yeah and also I mean it's like the Civil War it's
1589120	1593080	like well if you're like I'm sure there's a lot of like complicated
1593080	1598080	feelings about it because if you're if you live down this way way down south
1598080	1606680	of the Chattahoochee it gets politically hotter than a hoochie-coochie
1607000	1611200	rap beat rap beat number two
1615720	1622760	yeah Southern rap yeah it's a hotbed of political intrigue I fucked your mama
1622760	1627840	like her name was Cheryl T exactly I fucked her in a bed on TV I fucked your mama
1627840	1633080	with the face of my knee I went like this I went like that I put on my coat
1633080	1638360	I chipped my hat I said madam southern hospitality that's fucked your mama

1694360	1707800	Airlines UPS UPS I'm not rhyming I'm just yeah thank you yeah thank you
1708440	1715480	yeah I have to I mean I've never been prouder not only not only is that just
1715480	1718960	good stuff is that just top-grade entertainment what you just did right
1718960	1722840	there I just have to put myself in the shoes of somebody that's only heard this
1722840	1727760	on the podcast and not having seen you do it in a little seafoam green sweater
1727760	1736160	your little jay crew pants do your little bit toddler dance you really are
1736160	1744040	a baby yeah you sing about put peepees and poo-poos and and my desire to fuck
1744040	1748760	your mama is really just a desire to get back inside the womb that's the last
1748760	1753560	thing you did was be inside a pussy yeah but that's what humanity is trying to do
1753560	1758680	that's it you saw 2001 it ends with the you know I never got that although I
1758680	1762960	saw when I was like man is evolving you know then we create robots robots turn
1762960	1768680	on us but then we become something different we become a space baby the
1768680	1772280	monolith represents the like like kind of like plot points of civilization you
1772280	1776580	know humanity like like the the apes are they touch it and then one of them
1776580	1780000	figures out I can use this femur bone to beat another ape and then it throws it
1780000	1782240	in the air it becomes a space station because everything that happened in
1782240	1785400	between is meaningless it's all just it's all just beating each other with
1785400	1789120	femur bones and then we're on the space station that's as far as we get and then
1789120	1794600	machines gain sentience and start murdering with their femur bone ie air
1794600	1801880	lock doors and we we move on and we become you know it's a thankless job
1801880	1807320	being sentient it's it continues I'm getting applause from the from the
1807320	1814640	Kennesaw Mountain guy Kenburn signed off on that synopsis he loves Kubrick he
1814640	1820960	loves Kubrick see like Kennesaw and Kubrick Kennesaw and Kubrick and a flip-flop
1820960	1831560	margarita I'm Jimmy Buffett hanging out pleased to meet you senorita what do
1831560	1835680	you think about Jimmy Buffett I know he makes my fucking skin I know his flip
1835680	1840800	flops are too fragile yeah cuz you step on a pop top yeah if you can't step on a
1840800	1845840	pop on a flip-flop you're you're an asshole you gotta get better flip-flops
1845840	1849520	and don't don't don't burden the listener I've got a problem about the
1849520	1853520	plot point of that that the big crisis is that he's lost a salt shaker cuz
1853520	1857000	they're everywhere he's you can get salt he's lazy he's hanging out this is an
1857000	1861920	ancient grease we have to carry Brian in a sack it was the it was the 70s we were

1867680	1871680	think you're gonna find a lot of people sticking up for Jim I think I think the
1871680	1875480	only the only voice you'll hear sticking up for Jimmy Buffett is like a laminated
1875480	1882800	menu at like like it won't be a human being it'll just be a menu you know a
1882800	1889640	bit like a fictional guy named like Pete like MJ MJ McMcFunnin Hannon's do you
1889640	1893280	think we could use our country riff to see if you could try to outdo a Jimmy
1893280	1897000	Buffett lyric just just off the top of your head and you know I can I could do

2279940	2284580	on where we are in our campaign when we last met our heroes had just finished
2284580	2288300	destroying a grip of constructs in what they discovered to be a long destroyed
2288300	2293180	ruins of a town mole rain was out of sorts and excused himself it was just
2293180	2297100	then that Sharpie tripped over an old chart book within the covers of the book
2297100	2301420	mole rain's dark past opened before them once a female and a mother of five
2301420	2304980	the arranger awoke to discover her children perished in a blaze her mind
2304980	2309220	broken she sought out a nude identity happening upon a cursed belt of gender
2309220	2312860	switching the grief-stricken mole rain took on a new more masculine role and
2312860	2318140	buried his past with his children needless to say Sharpie and Cork were a
2318140	2322260	bit surprised but being victims of xenophobia as well decided to accept
2322260	2326700	their strange friends stranger past the group headed west towards the barbarian
2326700	2330460	encampment hoping that mangoes barbarians could hold up against the
2330460	2336380	darks fleet all right yeah because of the limited microphones we should have
2336380	2339780	Erin McGathey come up and play her character really quickly and then and
2339780	2353940	then make up a reason I'll leave is Erin here Erin come on on air McGathey Erin
2353940	2358300	is selling merchandise she made she would make I don't know she didn't knit
2358300	2361980	them or anything made had all the t-shirts she's been the merchandise czar
2361980	2367540	for the whole thing and is like merchandise maven share a mic with me
2367540	2375740	sure even though it's illegal so if you're a cop or your friend is a cop
2375740	2379820	like trying to give us a 20 minutes because if you buy something we'll sign
2379820	2382820	it out there like out those doors and you can you can buy shit out there too
2382820	2386740	but we're kind of cramped here and trying to do everything we can for
2386740	2394620	everyone just don't burn your city anymore just calm down all right so so
2394620	2400580	we're heading west toward the butts a lot encampment headed west yes how long
2400580	2405780	a journey is this who knows perhaps days perhaps hours perhaps you know a
2405780	2412660	certain amount of time other than that I say we move as quickly as possible
2412660	2418300	because your father's in danger Sharpie that reminds me gentlemen I have
2418300	2425060	something to do in a different area I may be trying to find a belt to turn me
2425060	2430780	back into a woman because I I did reveal in our last last installment that I
2430780	2434300	might have feelings for Sharpie I'm embarrassed please try to forget what I
2434300	2439460	said but I I must apart so you're so you're a man and you want to turn into a
2439460	2443780	woman so you can be with your with the guy that you love
2444980	2454460	all right Erin McGathey we can do that we can just tell her to leave well you
2454460	2460700	know there's not a lot of mics up here Jeff's eyes just lit up you make your
2460700	2465340	way back through the hilly butts expanse you hurry in the hopes of making it to
2465340	2469860	camp in time as you get closer you can hear the screams and shouts of pitched
2469860	2477140	battle the war cries of barbarians sorry reaching the crest of a foothill I can't
2477140	2481100	do both things you can see yellow camp the grand yellow tent is splattered
2481100	2484780	with blood a massive pit near the camp seems to be the locus of the warring
2484780	2488900	forces corpses of gnolls and humans life strewn across the ground and you can see
2488900	2492740	destroyed cylinder constructs ripped to shreds and lying in piles of metal
2492740	2497980	cylinders you can see a massive line of at least at least 60 cylinders pushing
2497980	2504100	back the barbarians towards the rim of this massive hit pit you recall this
2504100	2507620	excavation site from before when they discussed they were digging for
2507620	2512700	something so there's a bunch of those cylinders that we fought and they're
2512700	2518580	pushing the barbarians towards a pit I get so confused I know man I get so
2519060	2523620	somebody somebody on Twitter or Instagram told me that maybe my flaming
2523620	2528420	dagger is one of the shards possibly I saw that conversation yeah we've been
2528420	2531700	neglecting a shard the whole time why don't we just do a quick check shard
2531700	2539660	check there's no such thing as that we take we take his emerald dagger and hold
2539660	2544900	it near our shards to see if anything there's some kind of similarity just to
2544900	2548580	make some guy on Twitter happy like I say yeah I recently rented temple of
2548580	2553060	doom when they hold the rocks together they glow so we hope we hold our shards
2553060	2557460	together nothing happens shit all right well you hear that out there Twitter guy
2557460	2562660	yeah fuck you in your theories what do you have to say about about that guy on
2562660	2565660	Twitter skeleton crotch
2568180	2574860	ghost fart all right so you're looking at a fight yeah we're looking at a big
2574860	2579820	fight then apparently I mean it was hard to kill three cylinders but there's
2579820	2588300	a big line of them now yeah do I see my dad you don't you grow worried you're
2588300	2593740	just standing I'm stumped man people are dying by the way if anybody out there's
2593740	2598340	a D&D fan who knows what to do and has any advice please help us out
2598340	2603340	oh was that was that Ken Burns
2605340	2614500	mountain and it was at a K Kubrick Kennesaw Kubrick perception check
2614500	2618700	perception check I drew a perception check in 3-5 that's known as a spot
2618700	2625300	check but spot check you see that the pit that the cylinders do seem to be
2625300	2628300	pushing towards the pit with purpose they aren't just fighting they're
2628300	2633180	looking for something so they're going to the pit that the cylinders want to go
2633180	2636260	into that pit and get whatever the the gnolls and the humans were digging for
2636260	2641780	accurate okay is it possible to run into the pit around that line of the fight
2641780	2645460	and dig faster so like while the barbarians hold these cylinders off and
2645460	2648540	get what they're looking for you can definitely try I run towards the pit as
2648540	2652580	you charge towards the fight plumes of jet black smoke pulling it to the ground
2652580	2657060	waylaying you and they quickly coalesce into physical forms two small mounds of
2657060	2660820	yellowed flesh stand before you the creatures have humanoid heads and scrawny
2660820	2665500	clawed limbs but lack legs you recognize these as the very lowest beasts of the
2665500	2671180	hell the pits of hell what's this beast called you don't know oh you just see
2671180	2675100	them sometimes are they blocking my way to the pits they're blocking your way
2675100	2680300	they slim it slither towards you menacingly I power attack all right
2680300	2686660	three one to three pick one one two three three nice you got a critical hit
2686660	2695220	oh yeah I'm not even I'm not even gonna will damage you slice through the
2695220	2699180	Lemure just as easily as it were butter it dissolves into black smoke you I
2699180	2703660	interrupt the cosmos to remind you to tip will who's who's serving you back

2719100	2723460	vicious claw but it dot but you managed to dodge today's my lucky day so far
2723460	2727020	yeah those hellish creatures were created by the cylinders you don't know
2727020	2731380	they just came from the sky is it possible to take my small friend and
2731380	2734620	throw him onto one of the cylinders like maybe you could ride on one and see
2734620	2740540	like maybe it'll maybe it'll go go back to the really insensitive man what's
2740540	2753780	your strength it says a million now nine but he's small you managed to throw
2753780	2760500	him a good 12 feet whoa he doesn't land atop a cylinder but he does hit it in
2760500	2766100	the side you can try and cling on if you'd like I I cling to a cylinder Jeff
2766100	2770340	what's your climb check you know climb on the skills climb on the skills we
2770340	2776100	talked about it climb on the skills hold up I have a nine awesome oh nice you
2776100	2784100	cling to the cylinder writing the cylinder it goes to the pit oh just now
2784100	2788100	you can write it back to the cylinder factory and from what I know of movies
2788100	2791180	like it'll take you why am I why am I riding one of these cylinders because
2791180	2797660	you're just thrown onto we are we we're still friends right just you're not so
2797660	2803780	sure anymore no no using gnome tossing is considered highly like highly I'm a
2803780	2808700	little drunk okay Sharpie you can see the largest ship of the fleet floating
2808700	2813420	directly above the pit the cylinder coal constructs float into the air and avoid
2813420	2817380	the barbarians they spin in a great torrent before descending into the pit
2817380	2821140	Jeff you're with these cylinders you're going into the pit terrific as they
2821140	2824860	lift out of the pit you can see they seem to be floating something it's a
2824860	2830220	large dark humanoid shape a golem but larger than any golem you've ever seen
2830220	2839580	it looks like it can easily level a city such as Atlanta the flying ship fires
2839580	2843740	off a massive harpoon striking the golem squarely in the chest you hear the
2843740	2847860	grinding of gears as the golem is slowly being reeled in by the ship the
2847860	2853300	cylindrical army starts to drift back towards the ship with Jeff abroad you
2853300	2857820	can like try and jump off should I grab a cylinder yeah you aren't as good as
2857820	2863380	jumping as you are throwing midgets but let's see now you can't sorry I I jump
2863380	2868380	off while the getting is good all right you jump off a good 30 feet let's see if
2868380	2871540	you can tumble I don't wanna be sucked on the ship with a golem that's how you
2871540	2876100	know I mean it's an adventure oh yeah well you can't leave you behind well
2876100	2881940	we'll be split up it's a fun movie that's like a plot and B plot ship should
2881940	2888180	I stay aboard the thing or should I do you want man stay all right I latch on
2888180	2893740	to that cylinder like Star Wars man yeah yeah I have a cylindrical army files

2914140	2918220	yeah so the cylinders are going up into the ship and yeah that seems like a good
2918220	2923620	this is a cliffhanger good spot to stop in a show that has to be
2924260	2933900	what will happen yeah Spencer you're done if I can make a request I hate to
2933900	2938540	put our fans and followers to work but I would love to see some artwork about
2938540	2941420	what just happened there with this with a with the ship and the golem with the
2941420	2945900	harpoon and meet me holding on to a big thermos this is going to a thing it's
2945900	2949780	not the first cylinder you've clung to Gage
2953780	2966980	by the power of homophobia I have the cheapness for making fun of people for
2966980	2974140	the way they were born um Kennesaw Mountain like that yeah he's very
2974140	2977740	erudite I was a picture going back to his apartment and there's a lot of wood
2977740	2988140	shelves and hey angry angry come up here get up here I want some advice for
2988140	2994260	next time let's meet let's meet let's meet so famous documentarian what is
2994260	3000300	your actual name sir it is Nathaniel Mets Nathaniel Mets yes I would expect
3000300	3004500	nothing less absolutely yes are you starting to notice a similarity of
3004500	3007660	archetypes from these guys were in Phoenix but he looks a lot like Tyler
3007660	3012780	dandy yeah there was a cat yeah there's a kind of like a like a there's a big
3012780	3019900	there's an Andy dick ice tray that there's a little there's a variation but
3019900	3025620	it's not there's a Andy dick now you're the you're the you're the you're the more
3025620	3030540	clean-cut intellectual thank you thank you thank you I never was in bio dome
3030540	3034620	with Polly Shore right right no no not that we know of you seem like a very
3034620	3038660	well-educated man do you have a degree in something well the guy I work with is
3038660	3043300	a very Civil War buff but you'll you pick up a few things yeah so you don't
3043300	3047660	have a degree in anything no I dropped out of college yeah what called you go
3047660	3051500	to I went to the University of Georgia at first three years later
3051740	3060420	no dogs I transferred to in Atlanta Georgia State University yeah the lesser
3060420	3065940	known Panthers oh yeah I forgot the Falcons had some kind of crazy game out
3065940	3069420	there yeah they're fucking dead I wasn't gonna bring it up because I don't I don't
3069420	3072260	think of you as a sports fan and probably most of my sports fan nor but
3072260	3076420	that but that game was insane it was almost as if they it was kind of an
3076420	3079340	Atlanta moment they were they were it was all being taken from them and they
3079340	3084780	rose back up well you rose like the south baby this is oh is that what the
3084780	3090620	flag say rise up oh boy wow you guys really hanging on to that shit they
3090620	3095820	should I guess I would too I mean it's I said earlier I know in our last one on
3095820	3099060	Austin that my name is Jeff Davis and so it's a very southern name and so I get
3099060	3104900	free stuff from racist store clerks I don't I don't know if I believe that
3104900	3108540	story it's absolutely true man it is absolutely true and then the cab driver
3108540	3111420	when I was telling him about the racist guy that gave me the beer turned off the
3111420	3114420	meter when I said my name and he wouldn't charge me for it but it's such a
3114420	3118420	common name it's a might as well be like John Jones or something and I wonder how
3118420	3123540	Bobby Lee would do here I think Robert Lee Lee these funyuns are on me
3123540	3131420	here Bobby Lee all right Nathaniel I always bristle when I mean a Nathaniel
3131420	3135460	because I feel like my name is some kind of working man's Nathaniel we're rare
3135460	3139020	though you got Nathaniel Hawthorne and that's about it yeah it's like an
3139020	3142900	elitist Daniel I don't I think you never you never were a Nate you're always
3142900	3147180	Nathaniel well to people you know better you are Nate because they get tired of
3147180	3151540	the extra two syllables what's the most important thing to take away historically
3151540	3154580	from Atlanta like like what I've made some ham-handed efforts to try to
3154580	3158220	personalize the city in terms of reading about its history in Wikipedia but
3158220	3162100	you've been here you have a history buff friend you have no degree you dropped
3162100	3168380	out of college you're not afraid to pop off I've heard you're not afraid of
3168380	3172300	politics yourself I'm I don't know anything about them so it's easy to it's
3172300	3177740	easy to not be afraid of things you don't understand I but but I mean I
3177740	3180660	don't know is there anything that I haven't considered about Atlanta that
3180660	3184700	you would like the podcast listeners to know we're drifting through here and I
3184700	3188860	don't know what's my point I don't know the most important thing to know about
3188860	3194140	Atlanta is we are an independent people that love our liberty and we love our
3194140	3201220	southern heritage no apparently apparently we have the Yankees you know
3201220	3210540	Atlanteans in the house what did you say are you speaking for yourself bring her
3210540	3215540	up on stage I think there's probably a lot of self-loathing that is required
3215540	3221220	to happen here is probably the most progressive of the you know I don't know
3221220	3223700	it's kind of be complicated it feels like one of those things you're not
3223700	3227180	even allowed to talk about as a as a northerner why passing through it's like
3227180	3232460	you guys like really owned the the whole the whole conflict in a way that just
3232460	3238100	it's not you guys you were you you eat at McDonald's but there are a lot of
3238100	3245340	racism still like kind of visible and no there are not did I see the guy in the
3245340	3251660	sweater vest there are no racism that I've ever seen in Atlanta you probably
3251660	3254860	have no
3256860	3262380	are you cheering the kind of rooting so it's like there really is bit like the
3262380	3267140	noticeable racism like what form does it take like what do you see it's against
3267140	3273980	the whites thank you oh boy so you're saying that when they call that they
3273980	3279780	the much the line the reverse racism kind of thing no now this is it we've
3279780	3283980	torn this audience in pieces I don't think that guy was speaking for the guy
3283980	3287780	that's why I'm saying it's complicated I think there's people that feel obligated
3287780	3292300	to go fuck fuck it fuck fuck the whole fuck the whole thing I'm sorry I'm sorry
3292300	3294900	I'm sorry it's like if you went to went to some neighborhood in Germany you know
3294900	3298660	you were making jokes about like it's like a joke to other people but then
3298660	3302500	they're like no fuck that goddamn it you don't understand I was raised taking
3302500	3306500	it shit seriously and it's like it's m plagued with the with the with the scars
3306500	3312380	of it and on either side it's it's a it's a thing seems to think that it's
3312380	3316860	completely it's done it's all over well yeah and that's beautiful thing about
3316860	3319980	Atlanta it's from what I've read is that you actually can find pockets where you
3319980	3323860	couldn't believe that because it's like I'm telling you for maybe I don't know
3323860	3327460	Wikipedia was in the business of bullshitting everybody but absolutely
3327460	3331260	it was that this is this was the this was the the Mecca of like the kind of
3331260	3335460	the historical black college movement like they kind of like like the civil
3335460	3339300	civil rights kind of like we're happening here before they were supposed
3339300	3343540	to be happening all around them you know there there were people in different
3343540	3345940	places cracking eggs on people's heads because they were sitting at the wrong
3345940	3349260	counter and all this shit and it was like Atlanta was trying to get its shit
3349260	3352540	together you know it while trying to maintain its identity it's got to be a
3352540	3358300	very complicated place to have lived back back then I don't know what my
3358300	3366820	point is fart fart fart break I have no idea it would be interesting would be
3366820	3369140	to sit down and smoke a joint with somebody that lived here and just like
3369140	3372060	like hear the whole thing and then you'd only be getting like 1% of the whole
3372060	3375460	story why don't we all why don't we all just pick a place I'll go hang out
3375460	3381500	afterwards we'll get high and we'll talk about race yeah way to go
3381500	3385300	Harman town there should be there should be a section of Harman town when
3385300	3388740	we colonize the moon there will just be a burrow where you can only talk about
3388740	3393140	race that's right right now just be called the right history of racial
3393140	3396660	historical district and it's all the shops have to have a racial theme it
3396660	3400860	doesn't they could be racist they could be anti-racist but it's like everything
3400860	3404940	and that way it will reduce consciousness of race to like a gimmick
3404940	3409780	like so they'll be like hey it's the race parade yeah and it'll come through
3409780	3412900	the other but then you know the other sections will be no we're too busy to
3412900	3420420	hate which is all right so Nathaniel what the fuck no hey I only made a scene
3420420	3424780	tonight because I would just want this is Dan fucking Harman and I have been
3424780	3430420	paying attention to this man and Jeff Davis for six years with laser farts you
3430420	3435620	don't even deserve to be in this war I can't tell you the how important these
3435620	3442780	two men are to my comedy life yeah I he's not a bad person for loving me
3442780	3449620	sometimes sometimes you just love me yeah hey I've seen this Dan Harmon talk
3449620	3454140	about how how loathsome he is and how fat and obsessive he is about himself
3454140	3459740	which makes me a god and a hero thank you yeah but you are looking more svelte
3459740	3477980	than I've ever seen you you are in Atlanta I have seen next to myself this
3477980	3483860	is the most naked man I've ever seen in my life I have seen his ass I've seen
3483860	3491260	his pubis and the links pubis that's right this educated individual has said
3491260	3498500	pubis in the Harman town all right Dan show me pubis you know Atlanta used to
3498500	3504940	be called terminus that was its first name the signal is the film based on
3504940	3512020	like pubis I'm going to exit myself all right thank you nice yeah that's the
3512020	3516220	Atlanta spirit yeah that's called southern hospitality I know that Adam

3638060	3647080	Minneapolis now I move no I moved to LA exposure is the best 101 show how dare
3647080	3653020	they cancel it so quickly you are the greatest man that I've ever known in my
3653020	3660980	life D&D isn't Pathfinder we need to go be a net minder the NHL just came to
3660980	3665860	town they left this is terrible
3674260	3679460	he fucking Chris rocked a Chris rock mic dropped it Wow probably the least
3679480	3686760	earned mic drop in the in the history or the most I've done some that were pretty
3686760	3693120	unearned I think the only less earned one was like just a guy working an
3693120	3696640	inventory at the microphone store
3696640	3714060	that was absolutely that was pretty pretty special all right I'm sure you
3714060	3717780	know we came on a little after five where we're pushing our envelope yeah I
3717780	3721060	think we're gonna clear the room for the week we got a little bit of time on it we
3721060	3725340	we get it we will also I think we should because I'm very excited there's a
3725340	3729240	couple towns we're going to on this tour that uh that I love and we're not
3729240	3732000	gonna get to spend any time in it we actually have a full evening cuz we're
3732000	3736440	doing an early show like let's all like like find me after the show unless let's
3736440	3742740	pick the best place to go eat and get fucked up and then and well without
3742740	3747040	without breaking into a we're all gonna take our shirts off you guys all right I
3747040	3749960	mean the easiest thing would be to determine now now that everyone's
3749960	3758140	listening like where's our consensus and where we should go yeah I knew that
3758140	3765820	was gonna have a titty bar we have a winner wait what some of the I think it's
3765820	3774340	like the jumbo's clown of Atlanta so it's a good titty bar okay really it's
3774340	3779040	where strippers go to die I think strippers just get up in the
3779040	3784480	morning to die I don't think they don't need to go to the temple of doom or
3784480	3789360	let's bring her out gentlemen she's got seven minutes to live she's chosen a
3789360	3793920	vocation unapproved by society and yet profited on she's on two bottles of
3793920	3798780	Percocet let's get her out she's a victim of institutionalized sexism put
3798780	3809940	your hands together for me so what was yours millennia millennia she's a
3809940	3819480	thousand tonight make her feel special her tits are underfoot one of the ten
3819480	3826180	percent of the strippers to live past her bra size stupid edited out trying to
3826180	3830660	connect dots and idiot seriously where we going not we're not going to tell
3830660	3835780	you where someplace where there's room for everybody to yeah I shouldn't I
3835780	3840860	shouldn't have put it to the room it's it will never agree oh there's something
3840860	3843700	yeah so you're saying the vortex is where we are we just stay here it's easy
3843700	3848420	right we cannot get in someone's truck certainly to do that so everything is
3848420	3852020	people who want me to sign stuff not to be presumptuous I don't think anyone
3852020	3856780	wants anything signed I'm from Wisconsin I don't know but if you if
3856780	3860460	you buy anything and I think we're good we'll scoot out that door but and then

3890220	3893260	two million people that watched it but all of them were better editors than
3893260	3897980	than everybody that watched everything else like pretty pretty interesting I
3897980	3905260	think I think I'm doomed to be a lightning rod for a bunch of geniuses so
