0	10000	Make some noise, send them here, you're at home!
10000	13000	Yeah, how are you tonight?
13000	15000	Yeah!
15000	17000	Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Harman Town.
17000	19000	I'm here for Jeff Davis. We miss you, Jeff Davis.
19000	21000	I am Brandon Johnson.
21000	23000	I am so happy to see you.
23000	24000	Let's get started.
24000	34000	Welcome to the stage, the master commander, Spencer Crittenden!
34000	36000	That dude ain't no joke.
36000	38000	That's the real deal, y'all.
38000	41000	We couldn't do the show without this man, please.
41000	50000	Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman!
50000	53000	Yeah!
53000	57000	Thank you!
57000	60000	Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming out.
60000	65000	It's, uh, it's October. It's officially October.
65000	69000	Oh, oh, oh, oh, I, yeah, the idea was that maybe I would have wrapped.
69000	71000	I forgot, I didn't even think about it at this point.
71000	77000	Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm a doomba, I'm a doomba, I'm a doomba, I'm a doomba, I'm a doomba,
77000	78000	I'm a doomba.
78000	81000	Wrapping, wrapping all the time is the name of the game.
81000	85000	I like to fuck your mama so hard her hair's like a mane.
85000	86000	Okay.
86000	89000	Whoa, oh, and leopards come round and round.
89000	90000	That's too late.
90000	92000	Wait to do it.
92000	98000	And your booty got found in the treasure chest at the bottom of the sea.
98000	100000	And I said, who's that pussy?
100000	102000	It belongs to me!
102000	106000	Break down like a robot dancer.
106000	110000	Break down, I'm never taking chances, sir.
110000	115000	I'm going to toot your papa's pussy in a bus and...
115000	116000	Okay.
116000	121000	I agree, I agree.
121000	124000	So out of breath and so fat.
124000	129000	And for any of the ladies that happen to be joining us for the first time tonight,
129000	134000	that's not, the pussies aren't for driving into.
134000	137000	At least of all with a bus, there's nothing.
137000	138000	How did this begin?
138000	139000	I don't know.
139000	142000	We've been doing the podcast for about seven years.
142000	146000	Our guest tonight has been doing, it's basically like a sister podcast,
146000	149000	I look at it as, because we like to feminize our enemies.
149000	152000	No.
152000	154000	I don't know why that is...
154000	157000	I think that's our worshipfulness of the feminine generally.
157000	160000	We have sister cities and sister productions.
160000	165000	When we call things, I think when they say a battleship is a she,
165000	169000	I think that's us trying to be flattering to women.
169000	170000	I hope so.
170000	172000	I do hope so.
172000	176000	It's a good thing, so it must be a girl.
176000	181000	Because it's soft, like one thing that makes us better than we can be.
181000	183000	Like a battleship with big guns.
183000	185000	Look at her big guns.
185000	187000	Look at those big guns that girls got.
187000	190000	She's going to blow the fuck out of our enemy city,
190000	193000	our brother city that we hate.
193000	197000	We're going to ally with our sister country and fucking shoot our tits
197000	200000	all over that fucking enemy country.
200000	202000	Because we're better and so we're women.
202000	204000	I don't know what we're doing with it.
204000	205000	I wish, man.
205000	208000	I really do wish that was true.
208000	210000	And then some people come along and go,
210000	213000	hey, maybe I want to do some weird shit with pronouns.
213000	215000	And we're like, fuck you!
215000	216000	That's crazy!
216000	218000	We're crazy with pronouns.
218000	220000	We do weird shit with pronouns. It's weird.
220000	221000	Yeah.
221000	224000	We're still trying to figure out what we should do to not offend each other
224000	225000	when we speak to each other.
225000	226000	Yeah.
226000	227000	That's going to take a little while.
227000	231000	Human race is like a little, thinks it's smarter than it is.
231000	233000	So we're like, fuck, we got language and shit.
233000	234000	This is how you talk.
234000	235000	Yeah.
235000	237000	So far it hasn't really worked out.
237000	238000	Yeah.
238000	240000	So we're still working our way through pronouns, I think.
240000	241000	And is that how English works?
241000	242000	English is a garbage dump.
242000	243000	That's why it's successful.
243000	247000	English is the language that said polystyrene is welcome.
247000	249000	Like, yeah, we've been over this.
249000	252000	I've listened to four podcasts about the history of English,
252000	253000	so I'm an expert.
253000	255000	I don't know.
255000	258000	It dominated the planet because it's content with the lowest of places.
258000	261000	It'll take a fucking inlet from any river.
261000	263000	Like, it doesn't matter.
263000	267000	It's just like a diarrhea canal that connects the earth,
267000	268000	and that's why it dominates.
268000	271000	Also, it's spoken by First World empires that can blow you up
271000	273000	if you don't speak right.
273000	275000	Anyways, I'm fat.
275000	277000	I got fat.
277000	279000	I've become now this person.
279000	283000	I'm fat because I'm working out, and now I'm in the thing.
283000	289000	I'm in the atonement with the father chapter of Amy Schumer's
289000	293000	I Feel Pretty, where I felt good for a while.
293000	296000	So I met with the goddess of, I was like, yeah, I did it.
296000	299000	I'm exercising every other day, and I feel good.
299000	303000	I feel the feeling that people, that you feel...
303000	307000	It's an interesting movie.
307000	309000	It's got some...
309000	316000	Actually, I can understand why it wasn't like a swish, nothing but net,
316000	317000	kind of like perfect.
317000	319000	Like, the times we're going through right now,
319000	324000	how could you fucking hope is on the move?
324000	327000	But it's definitely worth watching,
327000	331000	because there's some actually profound grounded shit that happens in that movie,
331000	333000	because the conceit is just that she hits her head,
333000	335000	and she doesn't...
335000	340000	They show her looking at her body when she wakes up,
340000	343000	but they don't do the fan...
343000	345000	Her point of view is that her arms,
345000	347000	instead of looking like this, look like that.
347000	349000	They don't use a model instead of her.
349000	350000	They use her.
350000	352000	And she doesn't say, look at my boobs.
352000	354000	They're so blank shaped.
354000	357000	She doesn't say, look how much blanker my legs are.
357000	359000	She just says, my legs are amazing.
359000	360000	She doesn't.
360000	364000	And so it's like a nuanced thing,
364000	368000	because it's like, what if the way you looked, which is fine,
368000	370000	what if you could believe that?
370000	373000	What if you just believed that the way we think we would believe that,
373000	376000	if we looked like so-and-so on the cover of whatever magazine?
376000	379000	And the answer is a lot of confusing jokes,
379000	381000	because to me, that movie is one flaw,
381000	382000	is that the world doesn't...
382000	383000	I don't know what the world feels like.
383000	386000	Sometimes the world is trying to talk people into thinking they're ugly
386000	387000	in that movie.
387000	389000	But then there's these beaut...
389000	394000	I think the scene where she meets the guy,
394000	398000	the meet-cute of that scene, is actually really interesting,
398000	401000	because it's very realistic, the what-if of...
401000	405000	What if Amy Schumer thought she was gorgeous,
405000	407000	and then she's like, oh, is this how it happens?
407000	408000	A guy starts talking to her,
408000	411000	and then he's just confused by how aggressive she is,
411000	414000	but in a way that I was watching as a guy,
414000	416000	I was like, that is attractive behavior,
416000	419000	and that does make all the difference,
419000	421000	which is what people are always telling us.
421000	423000	You just have to think that you...
423000	425000	Blah, blah, blah, and act like you look how you...
425000	429000	All this stuff, it's very complicated stuff to me.
429000	432000	People are really big on confidence in other people,
432000	436000	because we're kind of fascinated by how you can see.
436000	438000	We love confident people.
438000	442000	Definitely, but we also love to hit them in the face with bats.
442000	444000	Don't be too confident.
444000	446000	We like to warm our hands over them,
446000	448000	but then we will also put our cigarettes out in them,
448000	451000	pour our beer into them, kick them.
451000	454000	And that's another interesting thing about I Feel Pretty,
454000	456000	is they do go...
456000	457000	It does track...
457000	461000	Unlike a lot of movies that have a simpler concept,
461000	464000	it does take you around the wheel,
464000	466000	where you're like, oh, yeah, okay,
466000	470000	so the fantasy about feeling pretty is...
470000	472000	We all have this thing in our head that's like,
472000	474000	if I looked like so-and-so...
474000	476000	And you pick whoever.
476000	478000	You might not pick Tom Cruise.
478000	481000	You might pick somebody for a totally different reason,
481000	483000	but whatever that person is in your head,
483000	485000	if I looked like this person,
485000	488000	then the reason that would be great is because then
488000	490000	I would be able to blank.
490000	492000	And I think blank is pretty much universally,
492000	496000	stop worrying so much about everybody else,
496000	499000	which we think is a service to other people,
499000	502000	because we tend to be toxically insecure,
502000	504000	like me coming out telling you I feel fat.
504000	505000	Like, what are you supposed to do with that?
505000	507000	That's me wiping my ass on you.
507000	510000	You're like, I just have your fat shit on my face.
510000	511000	Like, what am I...
511000	512000	You know, you look great.
512000	513000	What am I doing?
513000	515000	Why am I doing this for you?
515000	516000	I have shit to do at home.
516000	518000	Like, I have dogs that need me.
518000	521000	Like, why are you the famous rich guy?
521000	522000	I'm fat.
522000	523000	No, you're not.
523000	524000	Fuck you.
524000	526000	Anyways, but also your friend can do that too.
526000	528000	You do that to other people.
528000	530000	We are most familiar with insecurity
530000	533000	as a thing that if it was gone,
533000	535000	we would be like super people.
535000	541000	But the anxiety is why we are good people.
541000	543000	And so it seems like a no-brainer to talk about this,
543000	545000	but they do a pretty good job in that movie
545000	548000	of like she starts like she becomes a prick
548000	550000	like in all the right ways,
550000	553000	like where she's sort of like, yeah, she's like, okay.
553000	555000	She's like trying to help her friends,
555000	558000	whom she now thinks are her less attractive friends.
558000	559000	Yeah, and their models.
559000	560000	And she's like trying to help them,
560000	563000	like hot people help ugly people in movies
563000	564000	where it's like, come on, just let it out.
564000	565000	You're gonna fucking do it.
565000	567000	And they're like to them, they're like,
567000	569000	why are you being such an asshole?
569000	571000	It's kind of fun to think about anyways.
571000	573000	Ah, two harmons up.
573000	576000	Watch that and Mandy and maybe, I don't know,
576000	577000	something about ants.
577000	579000	Keep it educational.
579000	581000	Two harmons up.
581000	585000	They don't make stuff about insects anymore.
585000	586000	I just want to watch.
586000	587000	They did.
587000	588000	Don't ask for that back.
588000	591000	You remember the bees with the Jerry Seinfelds
591000	592000	and the ants.
592000	593000	No, no, no, no, no.
593000	595000	I don't mean like when you find out bees
595000	598000	take the bee subway and have bee relationship.
599000	602000	And got bee laid off.
603000	606000	I mean like actual like British guy,
606000	609000	like no music and just like 20 minutes
609000	612000	of just watching fucking writhing insect bodies
612000	615000	like moving around and then a John Cleese guy going like,
615000	620000	the yellow jacket has returned with news from the colony.
622000	626000	Using an intricate wag of its abdomen,
626000	629000	its thorax moving in shape so precise
629000	634000	that MIT departments were unable to decode it all the way.
635000	637000	This intricate alphabet, if it were in English,
637000	642000	would have 550 letters and be 700,000 words long
642000	644000	or something and you're like, what?
644000	647000	The wiggle butt language and then they explain everything.
647000	649000	Oh, new queen is on the way and so it's time
649000	651000	to sting her competitors to death.
651000	653000	And like they show everything.
653000	655000	Like they show ants like walking through the tunnels
655000	657000	and like how can we do that in the 70s
657000	658000	and we can't do it now?
658000	660000	We can, we just don't want to anymore.
660000	663000	We're like, oh, we get ants.
664000	666000	I want to take this big foot.
666000	667000	What's his name?
667000	670000	Attenborough guys, like get those cameras out
670000	672000	in the middle of the North Pole.
672000	675000	Let's watch these seals have a wet dream.
677000	679000	I don't care if that's more rare.
679000	681000	I like the ant stuff.
682000	683000	I like ants.
683000	686000	Notice how the seal rolls on its back and humps the air.
687000	688000	I don't know why I'm so whiny.
688000	691000	I don't know what part of the other thing is like,
691000	692000	by the way, I'm happy.
692000	694000	I don't know why I've come out like a part of it is like,
694000	695000	what are you supposed to whine about?
695000	698000	I tell lately and I'm not, I'm not a whiny person.
699000	701000	I don't like that kind of laugh.
704000	709000	That was, that was so clearly involuntary that.
710000	712000	Was that, oh, that was you.
712000	713000	Oh, that was you.
713000	714000	Okay.
714000	715000	Wait, are you, you're not, you're not.
715000	716000	Someone just wanted a brand new TV.
716000	717000	Are you Nova's dad?
717000	718000	Oh, okay.
718000	719000	I thought it was her.
719000	722000	I thought, I thought, you know, Nova's, Nova's very young
722000	724000	and like her dad, I don't know.
724000	725000	She probably doesn't want people to know.
725000	727000	She, they, God damn it.
727000	729000	And Harmon, they don't make a big deal out of the pronoun thing
729000	730000	because that's also a thing that you do.
730000	732000	You fucking wipe your ass all over people.
732000	734000	It's just fucking Harmon.
734000	735000	You stopped talking about it.
735000	737000	You saw which side I was on.
739000	740000	All right.
740000	741000	I got, I got, I got, I got my notes.
741000	742000	Okay.
742000	743000	Here are my notes and then we're going to bring out our guest.
743000	744000	Okay.
744000	745000	Here's the thing.
745000	746000	All right.
746000	747000	So, well, this is, this belongs on a segment.
747000	749000	It's called things that I, I'm not allowed to complain about
749000	752000	because I'm actually, honestly, not even poor people are allowed
752000	755000	to complain about what I'm going to complain about, but play a,
755000	756000	play a little music cue.
756000	758000	Like it's a segment, like
759000	763000	Things I can't complain about.
763000	765000	Oh, yeah.
765000	768000	I'm a British in the eighties.
768000	772000	Dan Harmon's not allowed to complain about this
772000	776000	the same way I'm not allowed to have angst
776000	780000	because it's 1981
780000	783000	and everyone is doing fine.
785000	789000	We're going to learn 30 years from now
789000	793000	how poor you can be.
794000	799000	Right now, poor means living in the goon docks.
800000	801000	Okay. Come on.
801000	802000	Knock it off.
802000	805000	Read my mind.
808000	811000	Living in the goon docks was the cue.
812000	814000	Who would fuck that up?
814000	815000	What do you think?
815000	816000	What do you think?
816000	818000	I'm going to sing about the goonies for 40 minutes.
818000	821000	What kind of podcast do you think this is?
821000	823000	The goon docks.
823000	827000	Some shit your old grandfather says before he has a stroke.
830000	833000	They called it the goon docks and the goonies.
835000	839000	Just like at all, like, look, when we order the food now
839000	841000	you get it brought to your house.
841000	843000	Are you familiar with this?
843000	845000	So they get the styrofoam cups.
845000	848000	And it's like, all right, we're all taking a hit for Mother Gaia.
848000	850000	We're like, yeah, put in some styrofoam.
850000	851000	Put a plastic lid on it.
851000	853000	All of us is like, look, we're humans.
853000	854000	We got shit to do.
854000	855000	Sorry, Earth.
855000	857000	Payback's a bitch.
857000	861000	You fucking tried as hard as you could to kill us forever.
861000	865000	Ever since we were amoeba, you were like, better be a better amoeba
865000	867000	or you're going to get eaten by a bigger amoeba.
867000	869000	We're like, we would rather just hang out.
869000	872000	And God's like, Earth, I'm sorry, Earth.
874000	876000	Earth was like, fine.
876000	878000	Be a regular amoeba.
878000	881000	Have fun being studied by the people that evolve out of you
881000	882000	a billion years from now.
882000	885000	And we were like, all right, I think your math's wrong.
885000	887000	All right.
889000	891000	So we make these things.
891000	893000	Sorry, our guests are waiting.
895000	896000	One guest.
896000	898000	Why are you not allowed to complain about these things?
898000	901000	Because listen, you'll know when I complain about it.
901000	902000	All right.
902000	906000	When they deliver the liquids, the soft drinks,
906000	910000	and they have taken the time at the restaurant.
910000	913000	Because hey, we're all on the same team, right?
913000	915000	Nobody wants your drinks spilled.
915000	916000	And it's moving on the go.
916000	918000	It's being delivered to you.
918000	920000	But they're not thinking about us.
920000	922000	They don't give a fuck what happens after they leave,
922000	926000	which is why they put a big piece of Scotch tape over the hole,
926000	927000	the straw hole.
927000	930000	These lids are designed for transport.
930000	932000	I knew I wouldn't have your sympathy.
933000	935000	I called your silence in advance.
935000	937000	You silver-legged fucks.
937000	939000	You judgmental.
939000	941000	I said I'm not allowed to complain about it.
941000	943000	Now let me complain.
944000	948000	These lids should either have holes in them or not.
948000	951000	Where are you going that they're putting Scotch tape?
951000	952000	Did you get the drink?
952000	954000	And you're like, ah, the food's here.
954000	955000	Thank God.
955000	956000	And they're like, yeah, thank God.
956000	957000	I got a million orders to do.
957000	959000	Everybody's got priorities.
959000	961000	Everyone's got better things to do than to make sure
961000	963000	your drink doesn't spill.
963000	965000	And their technique, the shit rolls downhill.
965000	967000	They're like, you get the thing.
967000	969000	And you're like, ah, time to put the straw in.
969000	970000	What the fuck?
970000	972000	There's a fucking Scotch tape.
972000	975000	Do they have a dispenser on the shelf above the thing?
975000	978000	Or did they make like a shift of people take a box
978000	980000	and they go like, this will be for deliveries.
980000	985000	Just buy the whole list lids and say to people,
985000	988000	or make like a collector's item thing and be like,
988000	990000	we don't want anything to ever spill.
990000	992000	And you should benefit from that too.
992000	994000	Here's a football-shaped cup that you can throw
994000	997000	and it won't spill, but it fucking converts into a thing
997000	1000000	and you can believe it on your porch and we'll give you a refund.
1000000	1005000	Let me wet my beak in this like efficiency thing.
1005000	1007000	It just feels a little bit like a fuck you.
1007000	1010000	They're like, whoa, all I know is if I spill something,
1010000	1013000	if your liquid gets anywhere, then that's on me.
1013000	1015000	And so here, I solved my problem.
1015000	1016000	Good luck.
1017000	1020000	Because you can't take a bag,
1020000	1022000	and I saw you roll your eyes at me, sir.
1022000	1023000	I know you think I'm petty.
1023000	1027000	I know you think I'm petty, but I said I was petty.
1027000	1030000	So this is not pettiness.
1030000	1035000	He was like, I can't believe this motherfucker's bitching about a sippy cup.
1035000	1038000	It would serve them right if when you got your food,
1038000	1040000	you like said, hold on a second,
1040000	1042000	and you looked in as if to count your tacos,
1042000	1045000	but you don't even care about the accurate taco count.
1045000	1051000	You actually go, oh, hey, could you untape the straw holes?
1051000	1052000	God damn it.
1052000	1056000	Because it usually takes me about 20 minutes.
1056000	1061000	Because I don't know if you've ever put scotch tape on a fucking lid.
1061000	1064000	You guys, look, nobody gets me.
1064000	1068000	I'm telling you, if I was running this world, oh, boy.
1069000	1071000	Shh.
1071000	1075000	Yeah, before childhood hunger, we got to fix that tape shit.
1075000	1079000	I bet half of childhood hunger is somehow related to this.
1082000	1085000	Okay, one more thing, and then I'll bring out our guests.
1085000	1088000	Here's, okay, a genius idea.
1088000	1090000	This is like, you can have it.
1090000	1091000	I got enough to do.
1091000	1095000	Somebody go write this up and get the people attached into it.
1095000	1101000	So Tom Hanks, beloved actor,
1101000	1103000	been with us for a long time.
1103000	1107000	We've been with him when he was a young whippersnapper,
1107000	1110000	a bosom buddy, a maze monster,
1110000	1113000	all the way up through Philadelphia,
1113000	1117000	all the way to Captain Robert Phillips and beyond.
1117000	1122000	Beyond, his road to perdition led him to, he's lived a full life.
1123000	1128000	One of his many roles was a child who wished he was a little older.
1128000	1131000	I'm saying now it's time you can use him.
1131000	1135000	We can do this big two colon small.
1138000	1140000	Let's go. Let's fucking go.
1140000	1143000	I actually got the idea from the Amy Schumer movie.
1143000	1146000	What is this? Let's go. This sounds amazing.
1146000	1148000	In the Amy Schumer movie, they reference the big movie
1148000	1150000	because they're like, well, I'll cite your references
1150000	1152000	because she's wishing she was pretty.
1152000	1154000	And then I was like, oh, yeah, they should.
1154000	1156000	And I was explaining to Cody, oh, they're doing the big reference
1156000	1157000	because of the thing.
1157000	1160000	And then I was like, I'm old. They should do one of these
1160000	1162000	called I Feel Young.
1162000	1165000	And then I was like, oh, reverse big.
1165000	1168000	Oh, big two colon small.
1168000	1171000	My audience is going to love this.
1171000	1173000	And she's like, you have an audience?
1173000	1175000	I'm like, well, the people that show up on Monday,
1175000	1179000	I don't know what you call them, friends, frenemies?
1179000	1180000	Judges.
1180000	1182000	I don't want you to give...
1183000	1185000	My judges. Oh, you like that.
1188000	1190000	Maybe we can get along.
1190000	1192000	Ah, my judges are here.
1194000	1197000	That feels like a healthy, honest description of this relationship.
1197000	1199000	Your honors.
1201000	1204000	My next guest might make you like me,
1204000	1207000	but I can't help it if you don't,
1207000	1209000	because you're out of order.
1214000	1216000	At the end of this podcast,
1216000	1220000	I will throw myself on your mercy as I always do
1220000	1223000	and we'll see what you decide at some point.
1223000	1226000	And I will stop you from doing that because I am the bailiff.
1226000	1230000	I'm, yeah, well, I'm like a crazy, I don't know,
1230000	1233000	I'm like the Senate. I don't know.
1233000	1235000	I just control everything.
1235000	1237000	Now I made us depressed.
1237000	1240000	Am I guilty of that? Fuck you, people.
1240000	1242000	I mean, if it pleases you.
1245000	1248000	All right, our next guest, sister podcast.
1248000	1250000	I mean, like, I've been doing it forever.
1250000	1254000	I mentioned this a couple of episodes ago where I was like,
1254000	1258000	you know, I did my impression of him and I said mid-impression
1258000	1261000	because I knew that somehow this connection was going to get made
1261000	1264000	and I really did not want it to reach him in an offensive way.
1264000	1268000	I said, hey, I'll fly you out, come out, do a thing.
1268000	1271000	I don't know if he took me up on that or if he was here anyway or whatever,
1271000	1273000	but Levi put it together.
1273000	1275000	It was like the next day or something.
1275000	1277000	I was like, they're coming.
1277000	1284000	And this podcast has been on as least as long as this one.
1284000	1286000	I'm fascinated with it.
1286000	1289000	I fall asleep to it every night in spite of the titular warning not to
1289000	1292000	or the titular brag that you're not going to.
1293000	1299000	Please welcome the creator and host of award-winning podcast,
1299000	1302000	The No Sleep Podcast, Mr. David Cummings.
1315000	1317000	Hi, everybody.
1317000	1320000	I'm sorry about how long I made you wait.
1320000	1322000	I said the same thing I say to every guest.
1322000	1326000	I said, oh, and then I come out and I talk for five, maybe 10 minutes.
1326000	1328000	It's probably been 20.
1328000	1333000	I'm just thrilled to be on the episode about fat people with big tits.
1333000	1335000	Yeah.
1335000	1337000	Right at home.
1337000	1340000	I was on a podcast
1343000	1346000	that tingled me to the bone.
1346000	1347000	Sorry.
1347000	1350000	You've been listening to me do my impression of you all day today
1350000	1352000	because we hung out all day, really.
1352000	1354000	Dan and I are BFFs now.
1354000	1357000	Is it okay to tell people that we did some recording today?
1357000	1358000	Yes, absolutely.
1358000	1360000	You had me on.
1360000	1361000	You have two podcasts.
1361000	1364000	Is the other one yours or is it just you're affiliated with it?
1364000	1366000	Are you a mogul?
1366000	1369000	I'm what they call in LA, Dan.
1369000	1371000	I'm an EP.
1371000	1372000	All right.
1372000	1375000	So the other one's called, again, Night's...
1375000	1376000	Darkest Night.
1376000	1377000	Darkest Night.
1377000	1379000	Created by the genius Alex Aldaya, who's here tonight.
1379000	1380000	He's...
1380000	1381000	Yay.
1381000	1383000	The Phil Spector of podcasts.
1383000	1384000	That's it.
1384000	1385000	Yeah.
1385000	1387000	And we recorded at Capitol Records, which was really impressive.
1387000	1389000	That was kind of a power move.
1389000	1390000	Yeah.
1390000	1391000	I was pretty impressed, too.
1391000	1394000	I felt all I wanted to do was take photos of all the sound booths
1394000	1396000	and the mics and everything.
1396000	1397000	Yeah.
1397000	1400000	And we spoke into a crazy binaural microphone
1400000	1402000	that's shaped like a human head.
1403000	1405000	You know those ASMR things on YouTube,
1405000	1406000	and the people are like,
1406000	1409000	let me rub a hairbrush on you?
1411000	1413000	And they're talking...
1413000	1415000	Well, some of them are talking into...
1415000	1417000	It's like the expensive one.
1417000	1419000	Looks like a mannequin head made of onyx,
1419000	1421000	and it has ears and a nose.
1421000	1423000	Why does it have a nose?
1424000	1425000	That's crazy.
1425000	1426000	Sorry.
1426000	1427000	Anyways, but...
1427000	1431000	And then you had me play a part in a no sleep.
1432000	1433000	Yes, that's right.
1433000	1434000	On the next episode,
1434000	1436000	in the current episode that just came out on the weekend,
1436000	1438000	we started a three-part series.
1438000	1441000	And Dan is going to be in part two and part three.
1441000	1443000	So make sure you listen to that.
1446000	1448000	It was really hard in the first thing we did
1448000	1451000	because it was like a dramatic kind of radio show piece
1451000	1453000	and like listening to you.
1453000	1456000	By the way, when you're just talking normally,
1456000	1458000	when you're like, I wouldn't...
1458000	1460000	You don't have this like...
1461000	1464000	You do this like performance voice
1464000	1466000	that sounds so distinct,
1466000	1470000	but then you sound completely like a normal...
1471000	1473000	Are you aware of that shift?
1473000	1475000	Do you like put a clutch pedal in
1475000	1479000	and go like, time to give it to them to the max?
1480000	1482000	Well, you always talk about me sounding like a Canadian.
1482000	1485000	So normally, like I sort of talk like this.
1485000	1487000	That's not that kind of Canadian.
1487000	1489000	I tone that down.
1489000	1491000	Yeah, I guess when I get in front of the mic,
1491000	1495000	I sort of, you know, brace yourself for the No Sleep podcast.
1497000	1498000	Go down low.
1498000	1501000	Do the intro as you...
1501000	1505000	Do your intro just sort of like what you say at the beginning.
1505000	1508000	And I... Yeah, I never remember it.
1508000	1510000	Here, I'll do it for you.
1512000	1513000	Fell for it.
1513000	1515000	I also don't remember it, but...
1515000	1517000	It just never stopped me.
1517000	1524000	It's time for you to lose sleep.
1524000	1527000	That's not... That can't be it. That can't be it.
1528000	1532000	For the dark hours when you dare not close your eyes.
1534000	1537000	Tales to frighten and disturb.
1538000	1541000	For tonight, there will be...
1541000	1543000	No sleep.
1548000	1553000	We've got six chilling, spying, tingling,
1553000	1556000	terror tales for you tonight.
1556000	1560000	But first, a few matters of finance.
1562000	1565000	Our regular author-reader,
1565000	1568000	Kasey Villejance.
1569000	1572000	One of those wasn't a letter.
1573000	1575000	I think...
1576000	1578000	Has found a lump.
1580000	1583000	And we'll be needing lots and lots of extra subscribers
1583000	1586000	for us to continue our scary work.
1587000	1590000	It's... And I know that people...
1590000	1592000	I think you have an adamantine.
1592000	1595000	Well, you have self-esteem.
1595000	1597000	You have some.
1597000	1599000	Not after tonight, I'll tell you.
1600000	1602000	But, like, you...
1602000	1606000	Obviously, I would never even go into that area
1606000	1608000	if I thought...
1608000	1610000	Not if I thought it would hurt.
1610000	1613000	I won't credit myself as being a pain-reader and responder.
1613000	1617000	I mean, like, if I thought what I was doing was hurtful,
1617000	1619000	I wouldn't do it.
1619000	1622000	So I guess that's me telling you not to be offended.
1622000	1624000	What kind of gaslight shit is that?
1624000	1626000	Don't be offended.
1627000	1629000	Well, it's funny, because I was talking to Dan earlier today,
1629000	1632000	as we mentioned, bragging about Capitol Records.
1632000	1634000	But, yeah, Dan was commenting on the show
1634000	1637000	and talking about my Canadian accent.
1637000	1639000	And...
1639000	1641000	You did that, I think, two or three episodes in a row.
1641000	1643000	And a lot of friends, a lot of people listened to that.
1643000	1645000	And so people were contacting me, and they're saying,
1645000	1648000	Hey, dude, are you okay?
1649000	1651000	Don't let Harmon get to you, man.
1651000	1653000	I'm sure he didn't mean anything by that.
1653000	1656000	Really, really, don't let it get to you.
1656000	1657000	It's all cool.
1657000	1659000	And I'm thinking, these people are worried
1659000	1662000	that I'm gonna be upset because I sound like a Canadian.
1662000	1664000	I am a Canadian!
1668000	1670000	You people think it sounds terrible,
1670000	1672000	or you think it's an insult, but no.
1672000	1674000	It's a thrill to sound like a Canadian.
1674000	1679000	Well, when you're a country that has never made a single mistake,
1680000	1683000	you look around you and you just want to help people.
1684000	1686000	Those guys talk weird.
1686000	1688000	Let's let them have it.
1688000	1690000	Let's hold them to a higher standard.
1690000	1692000	Nobody down here talks weird.
1694000	1697000	It's not weird. It's super soothing.
1697000	1699000	I think that...
1699000	1704000	Well, I'm from Wisconsin, so the treatment of vowel sounds
1704000	1706000	is a little related.
1706000	1708000	I find it to be more lullaby-like.
1709000	1711000	The making love to vowel sounds.
1711000	1713000	I truly love it.
1713000	1716000	Nobody wants to hear about the word aboot
1716000	1718000	and that oot and aboot and all that stuff
1718000	1720000	because it's like making mime jokes now.
1720000	1723000	It's so played out, but at the same time,
1723000	1726000	I get a little dopamine spike when a word comes up
1726000	1729000	that you just pronounce that way
1729000	1733000	because it feels like an uncle or a father or something.
1733000	1736000	It feels friendly.
1737000	1740000	This business of horror feels very nurturing.
1740000	1743000	It's October.
1743000	1747000	What I learned from Campbell is that trick-or-treat,
1747000	1751000	all of our Halloween tradition is all about this duality.
1751000	1754000	It's not just like,
1754000	1757000	Hey, knock, knock, who's there?
1757000	1759000	Torture!
1759000	1761000	That's sometimes what horror becomes,
1761000	1765000	but this idea of sit down in front of this fireplace
1765000	1767000	I'm a nice guy,
1767000	1769000	but I want to tell you about someone
1769000	1773000	that'll eat your fucking guts out with a straw.
1773000	1775000	It's more effective because you're like,
1775000	1778000	I didn't want to have to warn you about this,
1778000	1784000	but the truth is there's a crazy corn-toothed Eskimo man.
1784000	1787000	That's political incorrect.
1787000	1789000	Easy with the Eskimos, man.
1789000	1792000	That word flew out of my mouth.
1793000	1795000	Speaking of which, though, I was also telling you
1795000	1799000	that because you're a sister podcast born at the same time,
1799000	1801000	I don't have this experience
1801000	1803000	because I haven't binge listened to our podcast,
1803000	1807000	but listening to yours go through these recently,
1807000	1810000	rapidly shifting times was very interesting to me.
1810000	1812000	Do you remember your first episode
1812000	1817000	where you very exuberantly, just enthusiastically,
1817000	1819000	really you had heard about the concept
1819000	1821000	and you were really into it
1821000	1823000	and were like you loved the idea
1823000	1825000	and you were introducing it to the people
1825000	1827000	and like if you'll go on the webpage,
1827000	1831000	we now have something called a trigger warning.
1831000	1833000	And it was like you had just heard about it
1833000	1835000	and it was like disco.
1835000	1838000	And like me at that same time,
1838000	1844000	do you remember adding that and being happy about it?
1844000	1846000	I don't remember being happy about it.
1846000	1847000	That's the weird thing.
1847000	1849000	Well, that you were behind it.
1849000	1852000	Oh, apparently you have to put trigger warnings.
1852000	1853000	It wasn't like that.
1853000	1854000	It was like I felt to me like you were like,
1854000	1857000	I heard about this concept of letting people know
1857000	1860000	where they are or aren't going to be comfortable
1860000	1863000	so that people can mind their own fucking beeswax.
1863000	1864000	Right.
1864000	1866000	And you were like, sounds really logical
1866000	1869000	and practical to me.
1869000	1873000	And I guess I must be a really quintessential polite Canadian
1873000	1876000	because inside I felt like fuck these people.
1876000	1877000	What are these?
1877000	1879000	This is a horror podcast.
1879000	1880000	What are you talking about?
1880000	1883000	Trigger warnings.
1883000	1886000	And so, because then the following episode,
1886000	1888000	it was like this class,
1888000	1890000	like this is what we were all going through.
1890000	1892000	It was sort of like there was this first round of like,
1892000	1893000	go to the website.
1893000	1896000	You'll see a new thing called a trigger warning.
1896000	1897000	A trigger warning is a warning.
1897000	1898000	It was just sort of like,
1898000	1900000	it was like not a big deal,
1900000	1902000	like nothing's happening, no bowing, no scraping, nothing.
1902000	1904000	But then the following episode I was like,
1904000	1906000	look, here's the thing.
1907000	1909000	The reason I did a trigger warning,
1909000	1913000	and the unspoken story was that actually what had happened
1913000	1917000	was this avalanche of maybe understandable,
1917000	1919000	but ultimately like bad target,
1919000	1922000	because you're just trying to do the right thing,
1922000	1925000	that you had been, there had been this backlash
1925000	1927000	that obviously people are listening to horror podcasts.
1927000	1929000	Their nightmare was hearing you use that phrase
1929000	1931000	because it meant something different to them.
1931000	1933000	They had a different relationship with it, et cetera.
1933000	1935000	And so you remember that time is my question.
1935000	1937000	Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
1937000	1938000	I remember the time.
1938000	1941000	And yeah, it was, I got a whole bunch of emails.
1941000	1944000	It almost seemed like a concerted effort by people to say,
1944000	1946000	you've got to be more sensitive to your listeners
1946000	1947000	and you've got to warn people.
1947000	1950000	And a lot of it was based around very understandable topics,
1950000	1953000	like we're not a show that's going to highlight stories
1953000	1956000	about rape or child molestation and stuff like that.
1956000	1959000	But we might imply that in a story,
1959000	1961000	so I can get how some people would want that.
1961000	1962000	Well, yeah, I know.
1962000	1966000	I think, I mean, acting as the opposite of your publicist
1966000	1968000	or agent, I would say, yeah, no,
1968000	1972000	this is a genre that is festooned with pedophilia and rape.
1972000	1976000	Because it's horror that is being written by people
1976000	1979000	who are, they're off the chain.
1979000	1981000	The roots come through Reddit forums and things,
1981000	1985000	and people are exploring really what scares me,
1985000	1987000	what will therefore scare a stranger.
1987000	1990000	And there's an often, campfire stories begin as that.
1990000	1994000	It would have been outrageous to ask a parent
1994000	1997000	via an affidavit or something if you're like,
1997000	1998000	hey, your kid's going to be at summer camp.
1998000	2000000	Is it all right with you if I tell him this?
2000000	2001000	I'm going to tell him a couple stories.
2001000	2003000	I've written the synopses here.
2003000	2004000	You're like, what the fuck?
2004000	2005000	What?
2005000	2009000	Two teenagers, lovers lane, my child is 10 years old.
2009000	2010000	What are you talking about?
2010000	2011000	It's not planned.
2011000	2014000	It's like very tribal and like horror has always,
2014000	2019000	it has its roots in, I mean, what draws you to horror?
2019000	2021000	You talk more than me about it.
2021000	2024000	I just like listening to it, and I don't know why.
2024000	2026000	Well, I mean, in terms of horror,
2026000	2027000	it's always been a genre that I like,
2027000	2029000	but when I grew up, when I was young,
2029000	2031000	I would lie in bed on Sunday night,
2031000	2034000	and there was a radio show in my hometown of Toronto,
2034000	2039000	and they played old-time radio shows like Lights Out
2039000	2041000	and Suspense and that type of thing.
2041000	2044000	So I was introduced to horror in the audio format.
2044000	2047000	So it was the magic of, you know,
2048000	2051000	if you watch a horror movie and there's a creepy basement,
2051000	2054000	you're seeing the director's impression
2054000	2055000	of their creepiest basement,
2055000	2058000	but if you're listening to a story and they say,
2058000	2060000	I walked into a creepy basement,
2060000	2062000	the listener is going to imagine
2062000	2064000	what their creepiest basement looks like,
2064000	2067000	and so their imagination draws them into the story.
2067000	2070000	Did those shows use sound effects?
2070000	2072000	Oh, yeah, they did.
2072000	2076000	Also, if I watch an Eli Roth movie,
2076000	2080000	I'll be like, well, I need more of a story than this,
2080000	2083000	which means, unfortunately for the horror director,
2083000	2086000	that I basically want it to be more like Jaws or E.T.
2086000	2088000	And maybe that director is saying,
2088000	2091000	well, I just want to make a movie that will freak you out,
2091000	2094000	gross you out, take you into a crazy, dark, demonic place
2094000	2098000	that your return threshold is running out of the theater
2098000	2101000	and telling your friends, I survived watching this movie,
2101000	2103000	and artists should have a right to,
2103000	2105000	they shouldn't be bound to my definition
2105000	2106000	of what a story is.
2106000	2107000	However, when I watch a movie,
2107000	2109000	I go to a movie with those expectations,
2109000	2112000	and I do not go to books, which I don't read,
2112000	2114000	with that expectation, therefore,
2114000	2116000	I definitely do not go to a stranger's,
2116000	2120000	half of the time anonymous, like crazy,
2120000	2123000	like I just wrote this to kind of fuck with you,
2123000	2125000	to fuck with myself.
2125000	2128000	And so a lot of the themes will have to do with,
2128000	2130000	there are heavy themes that emerge
2130000	2132000	that put you in an uncomfortable place,
2132000	2136000	are abortion, there's such a huge,
2136000	2139000	it's almost because where else would you go
2139000	2141000	except the idea of children,
2141000	2143000	children being threatened,
2143000	2146000	the stakes can only get so high before,
2146000	2149000	like some theme of that.
2149000	2152000	Your stories, like you said, they don't go there,
2152000	2154000	you would never be mistaken for being into
2154000	2157000	the things that you're supposed to be scared of.
2157000	2159000	But they have to be able to go there
2159000	2161000	in order to enjoy it.
2161000	2163000	I think that, I don't know what,
2163000	2165000	I know that I could never, I can't,
2165000	2169000	our friend John Grills, who does the Creepy Podcast,
2169000	2172000	which is more of just how I found your podcast,
2172000	2175000	he told me, because I was like,
2175000	2177000	I don't think I could ever write horror,
2177000	2179000	I wouldn't know how to do it, and he said,
2179000	2182000	just scare yourself, like do the same advice
2182000	2184000	with comedy as you would for horror,
2184000	2188000	and then I think, oh yeah, no, then I couldn't do it.
2188000	2191000	Because when I think about being scared,
2191000	2193000	I get scared.
2193000	2196000	So my stories would be about like,
2196000	2199000	someone made me go to a scary thing.
2199000	2204000	And I said, no, I'm not gonna go,
2204000	2206000	I'm not gonna go to that scary thing,
2206000	2208000	I don't like being startled.
2208000	2214000	And then they felt bad, and that made me feel bad.
2214000	2217000	Well, yeah, it's true, it's true.
2217000	2219000	So I like listening to other people who go there,
2219000	2222000	and I'm like, I'm a proctologist
2222000	2225000	that likes to do extracurricular work,
2225000	2228000	and I'm like, whoa, that's not a real example.
2228000	2231000	Well, yeah, and the other thing too,
2231000	2233000	when it comes to writing horror,
2233000	2235000	not that I do a lot of it,
2235000	2237000	but you think that one of the big things about horror
2237000	2239000	is if there's a twist,
2239000	2241000	or if there's something you don't see coming,
2241000	2243000	and that can be the real scary point,
2243000	2245000	but if you're writing it while you know what the twist is,
2245000	2248000	so you can never put yourself behind the scenes
2248000	2251000	enough to know to experience that twist.
2251000	2253000	What scares you?
2253000	2255000	What scares you?
2255000	2259000	What scares me?
2259000	2262000	The thing, well, it's not so much of a broad theme,
2262000	2264000	but the thing that creeps me out the most,
2264000	2266000	and you see it a lot in horror films,
2266000	2267000	is that someone's standing outside
2267000	2269000	and they look up at their house,
2269000	2271000	and there's a face in the window.
2271000	2272000	And if there's something about,
2272000	2273000	it's either you're inside the house
2273000	2274000	and you look out the window,
2274000	2276000	and you see somebody standing in your yard,
2276000	2278000	or you see a face in the window,
2278000	2279000	that always gives you the chance.
2279000	2281000	Or like the house you just got out of.
2281000	2284000	Like there's stories where there's weird shit
2284000	2285000	going on in the house,
2285000	2287000	and then finally the person does what you would do,
2287000	2289000	which is they just get the fuck out of there.
2289000	2291000	They're like, I'm going to stay in a motel,
2291000	2292000	and then they drop their keys,
2292000	2293000	and they look up,
2293000	2296000	and there's a fucking person in the window.
2296000	2298000	It's almost scary.
2298000	2301000	Remember that classic urban legend
2301000	2304000	about the trucker with the headlights?
2304000	2306000	The punchline of that is that you lived,
2306000	2309000	but it's scarier thinking about,
2309000	2312000	there was a dude in your backseat.
2312000	2314000	Because part of that is like,
2314000	2317000	or that's like the red eyeball behind the keyhole
2317000	2319000	or whatever, the red room.
2319000	2320000	That's another classic where it's like,
2320000	2321000	I looked through the keyhole,
2321000	2322000	and it was just red.
2322000	2323000	All I saw was red.
2323000	2325000	I heard that hotel room was haunted,
2325000	2326000	and I looked through the red,
2326000	2327000	but I already blew it.
2327000	2328000	There's a red eye.
2328000	2329000	Whatever, who cares?
2330000	2331000	I can't write horror.
2331000	2332000	I don't know what I'd do.
2332000	2335000	It would be all about cutting.
2335000	2337000	I don't even know where I'd go.
2337000	2338000	Whatever scares you.
2338000	2339000	What scares you?
2339000	2341000	Surgery.
2341000	2344000	Just basic, like bees.
2344000	2346000	Yeah.
2346000	2347000	People.
2347000	2350000	Conversations.
2350000	2352000	The alt-right.
2352000	2353000	Home invasion.
2353000	2354000	What?
2354000	2356000	Losing Cody.
2356000	2358000	Disappointing my dogs.
2358000	2359000	What would make you run?
2359000	2360000	What?
2360000	2361000	What would make you run?
2361000	2362000	No questions asked.
2362000	2363000	Everything!
2363000	2364000	I've never asked questions.
2364000	2365000	I'm not allowed to talk.
2365000	2366000	I start running.
2366000	2367000	I'm like,
2367000	2369000	hey, you know why I'm not running?
2369000	2370000	Shut up.
2372000	2373000	Have you ever lived through the horror
2373000	2375000	of when you go to a fast food restaurant
2375000	2376000	and they give you a soft drink
2376000	2379000	and there's like this prophylactic over the hole?
2382000	2383000	Terrifying.
2383000	2384000	Run.
2385000	2388000	Are you implying in all of your Canadian grace
2388000	2391000	that that piece of Scotch tape is doing me the service
2391000	2395000	of keeping germs out of my Thai iced tea?
2397000	2398000	You're saying, by the way, you're welcome
2398000	2401000	for keeping those germs out of the hole.
2401000	2402000	It's just to protect them.
2402000	2404000	They don't want to have to spill it.
2404000	2405000	I don't know.
2405000	2407000	I've never experienced that.
2407000	2408000	It's so hard.
2408000	2410000	You're peeling at this thing
2410000	2412000	and the tape just breaks.
2413000	2415000	It breaks into little strings.
2415000	2418000	You're pulling threads of Scotch tape.
2418000	2419000	I'm telling you,
2419000	2422000	look, why don't you kids get a job?
2425000	2428000	Well, they've got to make capri sun straws
2428000	2429000	where you could just like,
2429000	2430000	they have a point to it
2430000	2432000	and you just go bam, you know?
2432000	2433000	Yeah, I mean, you can't tell me that.
2433000	2434000	Thank you.
2434000	2435000	Yes, everybody applauds
2435000	2437000	and stand while you're doing it.
2439000	2440000	Look at you.
2440000	2441000	I guess that was a good idea.
2441000	2444000	I see shark tank motherfuckers.
2445000	2447000	People come up with stuff.
2447000	2448000	There just isn't enough pushback
2448000	2450000	from the community.
2450000	2453000	We need to focus on how hard it is for...
2453000	2454000	Yeah, yeah, I know.
2454000	2456000	You can't complain about this stuff anymore
2456000	2459000	because it's like, the world is too connected
2459000	2462000	and the real life became the internet,
2462000	2464000	so you really can't anymore.
2464000	2465000	It's not fun even.
2465000	2467000	It used to already be whiny and taboo,
2467000	2468000	but you can't be like,
2468000	2470000	I was on my way over here
2470000	2474000	and the weight person did one of these things
2474000	2476000	and everyone now is just like,
2476000	2477000	yeah, they make minimum wage.
2477000	2479000	Fuck you, you fucking cocksucker.
2480000	2482000	And then a bunch of people attack them.
2482000	2483000	What's wrong with sucking cock?
2483000	2485000	Nothing, I just say...
2486000	2487000	If he was doing it...
2487000	2488000	Never mind.
2488000	2489000	I just...
2489000	2490000	The pointed straw would be good.
2490000	2491000	A pointed straw?
2491000	2492000	Everyone wins.
2492000	2494000	Or like, you know, they have those.
2494000	2495000	They have some of them,
2495000	2496000	but they're the lids that are like,
2496000	2499000	legitimately sealed until you really poke the plot.
2499000	2501000	Like when there's a circular thing
2501000	2503000	and you poke right down in there
2503000	2504000	and it's like, ready made
2504000	2506000	and it's really satisfying.
2506000	2507000	It's gotta be, what?
2507000	2508000	It exists.
2508000	2510000	It's gotta be a half a penny more per lid.
2510000	2512000	And we're all gonna get rich.
2512000	2514000	Half penny at a time.
2514000	2516000	Just write a screenplay.
2521000	2524000	It's not that difficult to figure out.
2524000	2527000	Everyone just write a screenplay and sell it.
2528000	2529000	And take that money,
2529000	2532000	put it into your restaurant supplies.
2534000	2536000	And what we have left over,
2536000	2538000	we build a radio for our island.
2539000	2542000	Why do I have to spell it out for everybody?
2542000	2544000	I understand how money works.
2544000	2546000	There's an island.
2549000	2550000	So we had a...
2550000	2552000	You got a...
2552000	2554000	There was a thing that...
2554000	2556000	Did Rebecca write the thing that...
2557000	2559000	Did she want credit?
2559000	2561000	She just got it if she did write it.
2561000	2563000	The thing, the thing that you...
2563000	2566000	There was a thing that's written
2566000	2568000	that we can do a performance.
2568000	2570000	Dan, some people call it a script.
2572000	2573000	In Hollywood we use that term.
2573000	2575000	Your team, the No Sleep team.
2575000	2577000	By the way, do you call them No Sleeps?
2577000	2580000	The individual segments, are they called No Sleeps?
2580000	2583000	Do you go like, I have to do three more No Sleeps
2583000	2585000	or this episode will be
2585000	2587000	Hmm...
2587000	2589000	Frighteningly under...
2589000	2591000	Let's run time.
2592000	2594000	No, Dan, we don't.
2595000	2596000	You don't call them No Sleeps?
2596000	2598000	What do you refer to them as?
2598000	2600000	Just stories, basically.
2600000	2602000	You're talking about the individual segments.
2602000	2604000	Yeah, I'm kidding.
2604000	2606000	We should call them, uh, naps.
2609000	2610000	Like, what do you...
2610000	2612000	I said naps.
2613000	2615000	Everybody applaud.
2615000	2616000	Like, what do you think...
2616000	2618000	Do you think Rod Serling called them...
2618000	2620000	called them zones or like...
2620000	2622000	He just called them stories.
2622000	2624000	Because it's not like you're going to confuse him with another thing.
2624000	2626000	Alright, I answered my own question.
2626000	2628000	But like, we call them creep shows.
2628000	2630000	The individual creep shows within a creep show.
2630000	2632000	It's confusing.
2632000	2634000	I'm glad that we're sharing this with our Canadian friend.
2634000	2635000	Yeah.
2635000	2636000	What else?
2636000	2637000	I guess...
2637000	2639000	What else?
2639000	2641000	You can't disguise that as good interviewing.
2642000	2644000	What else?
2644000	2647000	Oh, well, welcome Bob Costas.
2647000	2648000	Good job.
2648000	2651000	I thought I was doing poorly, but the what else guy is here.
2651000	2652000	Get out of here.
2652000	2654000	Put your knackered off.
2654000	2657000	I heard my question and then I was like, no.
2657000	2659000	No, don't ask that question.
2659000	2660000	There's a thing.
2660000	2661000	There's a thing that's been written.
2661000	2662000	Yeah.
2662000	2663000	None of us read it.
2663000	2664000	It's been written.
2664000	2667000	And you're like, we can perform it, right?
2667000	2670000	We're going to perform it No Sleep style.
2670000	2672000	Yes, we're going to do a story for you tonight.
2672000	2673000	Yeah.
2673000	2676000	I got...
2676000	2679000	We got these tablets, but they're locked.
2679000	2681000	So I don't know how to unlock them.
2681000	2683000	What's your password?
2683000	2685000	Oh, the great Alex Aldea.
2685000	2687000	Can you yell out your password and your pin number?
2687000	2688000	Well, if you want to...
2688000	2690000	Could you come up, maybe?
2690000	2692000	Yeah, we'll get some help.
2692000	2694000	Alex Aldea, ladies and gentlemen.
2694000	2695000	Yeah.
2695000	2696000	There he comes.
2696000	2697000	Someone.
2697000	2698000	Anyone.
2698000	2699000	One of the sleeps.
2699000	2700000	Sorry about that.
2700000	2701000	Thanks.
2701000	2707400	So as I mentioned, Dan was talking about No Sleep on the show and talking about Canada
2707400	2708920	and me being a Canadian and all that.
2708920	2718320	So we talked to one of our famous writers, one of our best, CK Walker, beloved.
2718320	2722540	And if you don't know, how many people here are fans of horror and Netflix enough to know
2722540	2728000	about the upcoming series called The Haunting of Hill House?
2729000	2734000	The great CK Walker is a staff writer on that series.
2734000	2739000	So we're thrilled not only that she is working with great people like Mike Flanagan and
2739000	2742000	doing all these big TV series, but she still writes stories for us.
2742000	2749000	And so what we decided to do, or CK did, was to write a short script about Canada,
2749000	2753000	specifically about Canadian Thanksgiving, eh?
2753000	2756000	Because our Thanksgiving is next weekend.
2756000	2758000	And we have it earlier than you both.
2758000	2760000	That's spooky as hell.
2760000	2763000	Any time the calendars change.
2763000	2767000	I would ask questions about it, but I think we're going to learn about...
2767000	2774000	Yes, that's right, because CK wrote this script with some fun, but also with some true facts
2774000	2779000	about one of the people who founded Canada, or at least got it off the ground many, many
2779000	2782000	years ago, and how it relates to Thanksgiving.
2782000	2784000	Is the music...
2784000	2786000	Let's see what we got.
2786000	2788000	Oh, you got here.
2788000	2789000	Good, that's right.
2789000	2791000	Yeah!
2794000	2797000	All our music has fat beats, Dan, so...
2797000	2799000	Great.
2799000	2801000	I guess I should get my script, too.
2801000	2803000	Oh, yeah.
2805000	2807000	First Nations!
2807000	2814000	Oh, by the way, Brandon will be playing the part of Jeff Davis.
2814000	2818000	All righty here.
2818000	2820000	Let's see how I can do this.
2820000	2823000	All right, hosers.
2826000	2831000	So in Canada, eh, we've got this thing called Thanksgiving there, don't you know?
2831000	2834000	Hey, it's offensive when you do it.
2835000	2838000	It works the opposite, because...
2838000	2840000	Okay, sorry.
2841000	2847000	Well, you know, it's tradition in the motherland to tell stories of Thanksgiving past from
2847000	2853000	around the world, and we do it around the holidays, of course, but today I'm in America,
2853000	2858000	Los Angeles, to be specific, and since Canada's Day of Thanks is quickly approaching, I thought
2858000	2863000	I would tell you about a Thanksgiving of the future.
2863000	2871000	Instead, a Thanksgiving when I extend an invitation down south to some American friends.
2878000	2881000	He brought sound effects.
2881000	2883000	And his doorbell was on Canada.
2883000	2884000	Sorry, okay.
2884000	2885000	Let us in.
2885000	2886000	Come on, David.
2886000	2889000	I haven't seen my balls in hours.
2889000	2892000	Yeah, I don't think that has anything to do with the weather.
2892000	2894000	Seriously, it's fucking cold.
2897000	2898000	Hey, oh, boys.
2898000	2899000	Welcome to Canada.
2899000	2901000	You're just in time.
2901000	2903000	Didn't think we'd ever find the place.
2903000	2905000	Well, I'm glad to see you did.
2905000	2906000	Sun's getting low.
2906000	2909000	Gotta get you inside before dark.
2911000	2914000	Packed quite a bit for a long weekend, didn't you?
2914000	2915000	Ridiculous.
2915000	2917000	You travel like a woman.
2920000	2922000	It's my laptop and some DVDs.
2922000	2923000	What?
2923000	2924000	It was a long flight.
2924000	2925000	Smart, if you ask me.
2925000	2928000	Not much to do and too cold to go anywhere.
2928000	2930000	What's the temperature outside, David?
2930000	2933000	It's about six degrees Celsius.
2933000	2935000	Oh, a bit of a scorcher.
2936000	2939000	Ah, can we get that in freedom units?
2944000	2945000	It's like 40 degrees.
2945000	2947000	Thank you, Patriot.
2950000	2952000	Can I get you boys a beer?
2952000	2953000	I'll take one.
2953000	2956000	Damn, nice place, David.
2956000	2958000	Smells fucking good, too.
2958000	2959000	Turkey?
2959000	2961000	Of course there's turkey.
2961000	2963000	It's Canadian Thanksgiving.
2963000	2966000	It's just called Thanksgiving here.
2967000	2969000	You got candied yams?
2969000	2970000	I'm afraid not.
2970000	2975000	Only in the U.S. do they put sugar and marshmallows in their vegetables.
2976000	2978000	I would love to get my hands on some poutine.
2978000	2980000	Ah, no poutine.
2981000	2983000	Uh, pecan pie?
2983000	2985000	Nope, nope, nope.
2985000	2988000	Thanksgiving in Canada is a bit different than in the U.S.
2991000	2992000	How so?
2993000	2995000	Other than being on a Monday.
2995000	2999000	Well, here it's not just a Christmas dress rehearsal.
3000000	3001000	Damn.
3001000	3005000	There are traditions and rites that must be satisfied.
3005000	3006000	Like what?
3006000	3008000	Oh, you'll see.
3008000	3010000	Sit down, sit down, eat, eat.
3010000	3015000	It's custom that the host tells the story of the first Thanksgiving over the feast.
3015000	3018000	Though I'm sure you're already well versed in it.
3018000	3020000	I wouldn't count on that.
3027000	3029000	This is great.
3030000	3033000	You're a decent cook, Cummings.
3033000	3036000	Definitely, but what's the green stuff at the end of the table?
3036000	3039000	Ah, that's mushed peas.
3039000	3042000	They were served at the first Thanksgiving in Canada.
3042000	3044000	So are you ready for the telling?
3044000	3045000	Yeah, whatever you want.
3045000	3048000	Just pass more of that Canadian gravy.
3053000	3059000	Well, the story of the first Thanksgiving starts in 1574
3059000	3062000	with a pirate named Martin Frobisher.
3062000	3064000	Wait, there's pirates in this story?
3064000	3065000	Oh, there sure is.
3065000	3068000	Frobisher had an eye patch and everything.
3068000	3071000	Lost his eye privateering for the English crown.
3071000	3074000	So was he a privateer or a pirate?
3074000	3076000	Well, he was both.
3076000	3079000	Frobisher was an Englishman who had contracts with the crown
3079000	3082000	to go explore the Northwest Passage.
3083000	3085000	But he also participated in piracy.
3086000	3090000	Frobisher's letter of mark, basically government license
3090000	3093000	to attack England's enemies at sea, was falsified.
3093000	3095000	So he was a pirate.
3095000	3097000	Yeah, basically, yeah.
3097000	3101000	But in 1574, Martin received the crown's approval
3101000	3105000	to explore new routes to the Pacific Ocean through,
3105000	3107000	well, though he didn't get the funding.
3107000	3110000	Frobisher was forced to pursue financing through his friend
3110000	3114000	and director of the cafe company, Michael Locke.
3114000	3118000	America's first Thanksgiving stories have way more murder.
3118000	3120000	Jeff left and Brandi showed up.
3120000	3123000	Oh, shit. Hey, Brandi.
3125000	3129000	So Frobisher weighed anchor and took his fleet of three ships west.
3129000	3133000	Because of some bad weather, he was pushed into Baffin Island
3133000	3137000	and landed in an inlet that Martin named Frobisher Bay.
3137000	3140000	And had the first Canadian Thanksgiving.
3144000	3146000	It's really picking up out there.
3146000	3148000	Yes, it sure is, Dan.
3148000	3152000	And interestingly enough, that was not the first Thanksgiving.
3152000	3155000	Because while Frobisher was on Baffin Island,
3155000	3157000	he discovered gold.
3157000	3160000	And that was the first Canadian Thanksgiving.
3160000	3162000	No, not even close.
3162000	3164000	You see, happy with his find,
3164000	3168000	Martin loaded up 200 tons of mined gold from Frobisher Bay
3168000	3171000	and hauled it back to England to present to the Queen.
3172000	3176000	He was celebrated by high society, welcomed into new circles.
3176000	3178000	People no longer mocked his one eye.
3178000	3180000	And Martin wanted more.
3180000	3185000	So he requested another expedition to retrieve even more gold from Canada.
3185000	3189000	He also petitioned Queen Elizabeth to be named
3189000	3192000	High Admiral of the North and Western Seas.
3192000	3195000	She agreed to one request, but not the other.
3195000	3198000	And Martin was forced to again beg for financing
3198000	3201000	from his friend Michael Locke and the Cafe Company.
3206000	3208000	Well, did he get it?
3208000	3211000	Did he go back to Canada for more gold?
3211000	3213000	He did, yes, yes.
3213000	3216000	And this time he took a fleet of 15 vessels
3216000	3218000	and fine gold chain around his neck,
3218000	3221000	a gift from Queen Elizabeth herself.
3221000	3225000	This time, the storm that hit the expedition was truly awesome
3225000	3229000	and they limped into Frobisher Bay with a fleet of only 12.
3229000	3231000	And this was the first Canadian Thanksgiving.
3231000	3233000	Yes, yes, yes.
3233000	3237000	Martin was so happy to make land that the 400 men on the expedition
3237000	3244000	sat down to a lovely supper of salted ham, biscuits and mushed peas.
3244000	3246000	Moose meat would have been more Canadian, huh?
3246000	3249000	Oh, Spencer, no, no, no.
3249000	3252000	Martin saw the moose as a majestic animal,
3252000	3255000	larger and more powerful than a horse.
3255000	3258000	He would never have thought to slaughter one for food.
3258000	3261000	And that's the story of the first Canadian Thanksgiving.
3261000	3265000	Well, yes, but there's more, much, much more.
3265000	3273000	Frobisher mined the gold and brought 1350 tons of it back to England.
3276000	3278000	Is that an animal?
3278000	3280000	It's a moose.
3280000	3283000	Huh, I'm going to get another beer.
3283000	3287000	So Frobisher was Kardashian rich when he got back to England.
3287000	3289000	Well, not exactly.
3289000	3293000	Frobisher returned to England with his 1300 tons of gold.
3293000	3297000	But when he anchored in London, he received unsettling news.
3297000	3301000	The gold he'd brought back from Canada had been smelted.
3301000	3304000	It turns out it wasn't gold at all.
3304000	3306000	What was it?
3306000	3309000	Iron pyrite.
3309000	3311000	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
3311000	3313000	Fool's gold.
3318000	3320000	Yes.
3320000	3323000	And he had literal tons of it.
3323000	3326000	Frobisher was stripped of his title, shunned by the crown.
3326000	3330000	The cafe company went bankrupt, and Martin's friend, Michael Locke,
3330000	3333000	was thrown into debtor's prison.
3333000	3335000	Wow.
3335000	3337000	I share your wow.
3337000	3341000	Martin Frobisher was humiliated publicly and otherwise.
3341000	3343000	People laughed in his face.
3343000	3345000	Can we get another laugh, Dan?
3345000	3347000	Ha!
3347000	3350000	Accused his one remaining eye of bad eyesight,
3350000	3353000	and Martin blamed Canada for the bamboozle.
3353000	3357000	Drunkenly ranting that the only dignified part of that frozen hell
3357000	3362000	was the enormous antlered creature we now call a moose.
3362000	3365000	I like the Canadian Thanksgiving.
3367000	3370000	Oh, what happened next?
3370000	3374000	Well, Frobisher died during the Anglo-Spanish War in France,
3374000	3377000	in a town called Brest.
3377000	3380000	Ha, ha, ha.
3380000	3383000	Well, I'll admit that story is more interesting
3383000	3386000	than pilgrims eating corn in the Greater Boston area.
3386000	3388000	Oh, but it's not finished.
3388000	3392000	God damn it.
3392000	3394000	It's not?
3394000	3398000	What other part of the stories could there be?
3398000	3401000	What about Frobisher's body?
3401000	3404000	His corpse is a part of the story?
3404000	3406000	Yes, indeed.
3406000	3409000	Upon hearing of Frobisher's death at Brest...
3409000	3412000	Ha, ha, ha.
3412000	3415000	Queen Elizabeth ordered his body to be decapitated
3415000	3418000	and taken back to Baffin Island and buried there,
3418000	3421000	so that his shame may follow him into death.
3421000	3423000	Why beheaded?
3424000	3427000	Well, because she did not believe Frobisher should ever be able
3427000	3430000	to hold his head high, even in the afterlife.
3430000	3431000	Savage.
3431000	3433000	Indeed.
3433000	3437000	And it's said that every Thanksgiving Frobisher awakens from hell
3437000	3441000	to climb upon his antlered steed.
3441000	3442000	A moose?
3442000	3444000	Yes, a moose.
3444000	3446000	And pass through Canada from coast to coast,
3446000	3451000	visiting our homes to demand a piece of gold from every household.
3451000	3454000	Wait, he's a headless horseman? I mean, mooseman?
3454000	3456000	Yes, exactly.
3456000	3459000	I really love Canadian Thanksgiving.
3459000	3461000	Why does he do that?
3461000	3464000	Well, he wishes to collect the fortune of gold
3464000	3465000	that Canada robbed him of.
3465000	3467000	To clear his name.
3467000	3469000	Exactly.
3470000	3472000	What was that?
3472000	3473000	That's hilarious.
3473000	3476000	So what do you guys do, eat Yukon Gold potatoes at Thanksgiving
3476000	3478000	or some shit?
3478000	3481000	Of course not. Don't be ridiculous, Dan.
3481000	3484000	We offer him gold for his harvest.
3484000	3485000	Gold?
3485000	3488000	Right. So, like, Canadian kids leave out.
3488000	3491000	Goldschlager on Thanksgiving night or mommy's earrings?
3491000	3495000	Oh, no, no, children are put to bed long before Frobisher arrives.
3495000	3498000	And you simply hand him the gold.
3503000	3505000	Okay, guys, seriously, what is that?
3505000	3507000	What do you mean, hand him the gold?
3509000	3514000	There's a moose on the porch, on the fucking porch.
3517000	3520000	All right, you have to hand it to him very carefully.
3520000	3522000	Remember that Frobisher only has one eye,
3522000	3526000	and he will be very angry if he accidentally drops his gold.
3526000	3528000	What gold?
3528000	3531000	The gold you brought for Thanksgiving, of course.
3531000	3535000	But we didn't know we were supposed to bring gold to Canadian Thanksgiving.
3538000	3540000	Jesus Christ.
3540000	3543000	It's a muffled door crash.
3546000	3549000	Now, everybody, slowly get out your gold.
3549000	3551000	Frobisher prefers solid metal,
3551000	3555000	but sometimes will accept flakes or even gold wiring.
3555000	3559000	I heard he even once accepted a book called Church Hill's Gold.
3559000	3561000	A book called Church Hill Gold?
3561000	3564000	Yes. Yes, and actually, growing up in my family,
3564000	3566000	well, we were very poor.
3566000	3569000	In some years, we offered him simple craft dinner,
3569000	3571000	cooked to gold imperfection.
3571000	3575000	We don't have any gold, you fucking lunatic.
3576000	3578000	His head.
3578000	3581000	It's sitting behind him. It's off.
3581000	3583000	His fucking head's off.
3583000	3586000	Well, of course it is. You listen to the story.
3586000	3589000	Now, quickly, stop playing around and offer him our gold,
3589000	3591000	or he will kill us.
3591000	3593000	We don't have any gold.
3593000	3594000	What?
3594000	3596000	Guests always bring the gold for Thanksgiving.
3596000	3598000	Everyone knows that.
3598000	3601000	Oh, God. Oh, God.
3601000	3604000	What if we don't have any gold?
3604000	3606000	What do I do?
3606000	3609000	If we don't offer gold to Frobisher on Thanksgiving,
3609000	3611000	then we will be massacred,
3611000	3615000	trampled to death under the hooves of his steed.
3615000	3617000	It's not a steed.
3617000	3619000	It's a fucking moose, man.
3620000	3622000	Jesus, does anybody have a Rolex?
3622000	3624000	A gold chain? A wedding ring?
3624000	3626000	Literally anything made out of gold.
3626000	3628000	On what you pay me?
3628000	3631000	Why don't you offer me your fucking Emmy, Dan?
3637000	3639000	Why the fuck would I have that with me?
3639000	3643000	I didn't bring a 40-pound suitcase like Jeff.
3643000	3645000	My suitcase? Shit.
3645000	3647000	I might have something.
3647000	3650000	Let me see. Let me just look.
3651000	3653000	Gold.
3659000	3661000	I'm looking! I'm looking!
3661000	3663000	Gold.
3666000	3669000	It's your line, too.
3669000	3671000	Oh, it is my line.
3671000	3675000	But if you want Frobisher to say his last line again, I'd be fine.
3675000	3677000	Gold.
3677000	3679000	Gold.
3679000	3681000	Gold.
3681000	3683000	Hurry, Jeff.
3683000	3685000	Jeff, wherever you are. Hurry, Brandon.
3685000	3687000	He has many homes to get to.
3687000	3689000	His patience is thin.
3689000	3691000	No, no, no. Not that one.
3691000	3693000	Gold.
3693000	3696000	Here, here, here.
3696000	3698000	Good. Bow your head and grip it tightly.
3698000	3700000	Do not let him drop it.
3700000	3702000	His vision is bad.
3702000	3704000	What is it? What are you giving him?
3704000	3706000	Jesus, Jeff, that's not gold.
3706000	3709000	Shh. He may accept it.
3709000	3711000	What's he doing?
3711000	3716000	He's showing the DVD to Frobisher's head.
3724000	3727000	He's putting it into his bag.
3727000	3729000	He's accepted it.
3729000	3731000	He did it.
3734000	3736000	Holy shit.
3737000	3739000	That was...
3739000	3741000	That was just...
3741000	3743000	Man, fuck Canadian Thanksgiving.
3743000	3746000	What DVD did you even give him, Jeff?
3746000	3751000	The 20th anniversary of the re-release of GoldenEye.
3752000	3754000	That fucking worked?
3754000	3756000	Ah, it was very good thinking.
3756000	3759000	Frobisher is very sensitive about his missing eye.
3759000	3762000	I'm sure he would like to have a golden one.
3762000	3765000	That doesn't even make sense.
3766000	3768000	I think it does in Canada.
3768000	3772000	I'm not surprised at all that Frobisher accepted our endowment.
3772000	3775000	It was very clever, Brandon.
3775000	3777000	Brandon?
3777000	3779000	Oh.
3779000	3781000	Christ, what is it?
3781000	3783000	Uh-oh.
3784000	3787000	I'm just going through my bag.
3787000	3790000	I think I fucked up with the DVD.
3790000	3792000	Oh, yeah? Wrong region?
3792000	3794000	No.
3794000	3797000	I didn't get to put the right one back in the case.
3797000	3800000	What are you saying?
3800000	3804000	I'm saying the 20th anniversary of the re-release of GoldenEye
3804000	3808000	is not in the disc in the case that I gave him.
3808000	3812000	Well, what is in the case you gave him?
3813000	3815000	Oh, fuck. He's coming back.
3815000	3817000	He's coming back. How much time do we have?
3817000	3819000	Oh, not much.
3819000	3821000	What do we do, Cummings?
3821000	3823000	Nothing.
3823000	3826000	If he doesn't have the 20th anniversary of the re-release of GoldenEye,
3826000	3828000	then it's already too late.
3828000	3831000	I thought I gave it to him. I tried shit.
3833000	3836000	Oh, fuck. I don't want to die in Canada.
3837000	3839000	Shit!
3839000	3841000	Run!
3841000	3843000	Our door is so quiet.
3843000	3846000	There's nowhere to run.
3850000	3855000	I thought it was the 20th anniversary of the re-release of GoldenEye!
3855000	3858000	I swear! I swear!
3860000	3863000	You bring my body home to the U.S.
3863000	3865000	You bring my body home to the U.S.
3865000	3867000	You hear me, Cummings?
3867000	3870000	Don't let them bury me in Canada!
3882000	3887000	I withhold from my death screen the letter U
3887000	3892000	because your country is so fond of it.
3892000	3896000	They use it too much in words like a boot.
3897000	3899000	I'm riffing.
3904000	3908000	I know what you're thinking, but don't worry.
3908000	3912000	I do live through that particular Thanksgiving Day massacre.
3912000	3917000	Every Canadian knows to keep a gold filling in their molar for old Frobisher,
3917000	3919000	just for this very reason.
3919000	3922000	Oh, and I do bring Dan's body back to the States,
3922000	3925000	so you can rest easy about that.
3925000	3930000	But I guess what you really want to know is what disc is in the case
3930000	3933000	if it isn't GoldenEye?
3934000	3936000	And sure, I'll tell you.
3936000	3941000	It's a Razzie-nominated 2008 Matthew McConaughey masterpiece
3941000	3944000	called Fool's Gold.
3949000	3951000	All right.
3958000	3960000	Sixteen pages.
3961000	3963000	Pretty powerful stuff.
3966000	3969000	I looked at the number of pages when we were at page eight
3969000	3972000	and I was like, oh, shit.
3973000	3976000	I was led to believe that you gave strict requirements
3976000	3978000	for what you wanted the story to be.
3978000	3981000	We keep a tight ship around here.
3981000	3985000	Let's do some, because a big part of the podcast that I like is,
3985000	3991000	at least once per season, you do these suddenly shocking episodes.
3991000	3994000	Is there a term for, is it like flash horror,
3994000	3999000	or is there like a term for the objective kind of mini no-sleeps?
4000000	4002000	Yeah, flash fiction is a common one.
4002000	4005000	Usually stories that run three to five minutes long.
4005000	4006000	Flash fiction.
4006000	4007000	Micro-stories.
4007000	4009000	Micro-horrors.
4009000	4010000	All right.
4010000	4011000	Let's do a couple.
4011000	4013000	No script for tonight.
4013000	4015000	And I'll play the David Cummings part.
4015000	4016000	Okay.
4016000	4017000	Oh, Jesus.
4017000	4021000	And then I don't know how we're going to do it,
4021000	4023000	because usually they're more narrated,
4023000	4032000	but I'll introduce one and then we'll go from there.
4032000	4034000	And then we'll make some adjustments.
4034000	4039000	All right, hit the music.
4039000	4043000	Oh, I guess I'm talking to you.
4043000	4044000	Yeah, hit your music.
4044000	4045000	Sorry.
4045000	4048000	I would have been more polite if I knew I was talking to you.
4048000	4050000	Hit the music.
4050000	4051000	I'm Canadian.
4051000	4055000	I wait for please and thank you.
4055000	4059000	The hourglass is almost full.
4059000	4063000	And time is just about up.
4063000	4070000	For tonight, there will be no sleep.
4070000	4081000	This is a podcast about disturbing you for fun and profit.
4081000	4084000	With an under emphasis on the profit,
4084000	4092000	which will be equitably distributed to all of the talent involved.
4092000	4101000	For the health care for all those involved in this show will be universal.
4101000	4110000	Anyone listening to tonight's show will have any injuries immediately healed
4110000	4118000	at the nearest hospital as part of a new promotion.
4118000	4125000	For tonight, there will be no oligarchy.
4125000	4128000	I'm your host, David Cummings.
4128000	4137000	And tonight I will be coming a few stories.
4137000	4142000	It took that long for you to make fun of my last name.
4142000	4144000	It's not making fun of your last name.
4144000	4150000	It's making fun of the idea of you were like, hey, hey.
4150000	4152000	It's like we used to say in the early aughts.
4152000	4153000	They're not racist jokes.
4153000	4156000	They're jokes about racism.
4156000	4159000	It worked until 2006.
4159000	4161000	And then everything started falling apart.
4161000	4167000	For tonight, there will be millennial accountability.
4167000	4170000	A few words about the trigger warning on our website.
4171000	4173000	What is this music?
4173000	4176000	Are you undercutting me with shittier music?
4176000	4178000	This is the only music I have.
4178000	4181000	You gave yourself amazing, like...
4181000	4184000	Due to budget constraints.
4188000	4192000	Well, it's season 11, episode 42.
4192000	4198000	And tonight we've got some scary nuggets for you.
4198000	4209000	With authors like Jennifer Akelby, Art Landon, Michael Stipe,
4209000	4216000	Porky Smith, A.J. Clements, F.B. Schwartz,
4216000	4224000	Arkey Snookers, and Celia Tone-Tones.
4225000	4232000	A brief word about the subscription plan before we get started.
4232000	4237000	Starting in October, we will be offering an extra bonus episode
4237000	4242000	for those who fill in the how do I pay blank sheet on our form
4242000	4246000	at nosleepies.com.
4246000	4249000	I appreciate these donations,
4249000	4254000	and we'll spread them out accordingly across the tundra.
4254000	4256000	I speak for the audience when I say,
4256000	4259000	shut the fuck up, Cummings.
4261000	4265000	But let's get on with the show.
4266000	4270000	We've got a series of micro-fast spine tinglers tonight
4270000	4274000	called Suddenly Shockers.
4274000	4279000	These micro-sized postcards from the Oblivion
4279000	4282000	will take you on a trip to fear,
4282000	4288000	but come with postage prepaid through stamps.com,
4292000	4298000	which is being subsidized by the Canadian government.
4299000	4303000	I know you don't want to hear commercials during your podcasts,
4303000	4305000	and we are sensitive to that,
4305000	4310000	so the Royal Canadian Mounties have given us a special check.
4313000	4317000	We are running like a Swiss clock up here.
4317000	4320000	Our first tale.
4321000	4331000	Cuckoo clocks are often a trope in chronological imagery.
4332000	4339000	These avian time tellers often say loud sounds
4339000	4343000	at various hours to ring the time of day in,
4343000	4351000	but sometimes the time of day is the only time you wish you had left.
4352000	4356000	Author J.K. Simmons.
4361000	4364000	He takes us through an example of what I mean
4364000	4369000	in a tale read by Culpert Rupert
4369000	4372000	that will make you understand
4372000	4377000	why I love my grandfather's cuckoo clock.
4377000	4400000	I will never do another episode of the podcast again.
4400000	4411000	It was a very difficult time for me because I had no time.
4411000	4414000	My beloved grandfather had passed away,
4414000	4422000	and at the time of his death his favorite cherished cuckoo clock stopped ticking.
4430000	4445000	I didn't know I had that power.
4452000	4456000	Bradley,
4457000	4463000	why don't you do something nice for your grandfather's funeral?
4463000	4467000	But I didn't know what to do for his funeral.
4467000	4472000	With his clock broken, cuckooing no more,
4472000	4475000	I knew I had to have it repaired.
4475000	4477000	Bradley,
4477000	4481000	you should hurry up and get that cuckoo clock repaired.
4481000	4485000	I'm horny,
4485000	4491000	and my needs come first.
4491000	4496000	And so I took care of her cuckoo,
4496000	4499000	lovingly, sensuously,
4499000	4504000	with lots of little birds popping in and out.
4504000	4507000	Oh, thank you, Bradley.
4507000	4510000	That takes care of that.
4510000	4516000	My true Canadian girlfriend thanking me for sex.
4516000	4520000	And that's when I called the cuckoo clock repairman.
4520000	4522000	Hey,
4522000	4526000	make this quick cuckoo clock repair season.
4526000	4529000	You tell him he can't leave his cuckoo clock here no more.
4529000	4535000	Hey, shut up, you fucking immigrant.
4535000	4544000	I don't need any of this immigrant shit going on in my cuckoo clock repair shop.
4544000	4548000	Anyways, what do you want?
4548000	4550000	My beloved grandfather has passed,
4550000	4556000	and his cuckoo clock broke, ceased to function at the very moment of his death.
4556000	4560000	Have you experienced supernatural cuckoo clock repair before?
4560000	4563000	Are you serious?
4563000	4568000	You know about Timothy, don't you?
4568000	4570000	Are you fucking with me?
4570000	4572000	I am not, sir.
4572000	4575000	Shut the fuck up, immigrants.
4575000	4578000	I'm trying to help you out. You can't even fucking with your wife.
4578000	4584000	I'm a Canadian fascist. Get the fuck out of here.
4584000	4587000	You need me tomorrow.
4587000	4592000	Yeah.
4592000	4601000	Sorry, I got a little situation going on in the back room.
4601000	4605000	Anyways, sit down.
4605000	4610000	You came over, right? You called and then you came over.
4610000	4615000	Yes, I phoned you and asked if I could come over to your shop.
4615000	4618000	All right, sit down.
4618000	4628000	You're going to want to be sitting for this story within a story.
4628000	4631000	I must know. Tell me of Timothy.
4631000	4641000	Well, all I can tell you is what I've seen, I hope I never see it again.
4641000	4645000	Back in the old days when this was a mining town,
4645000	4650000	nobody cared what time it was.
4650000	4656000	Eventually they found out they could mine more coal if they took a bird down,
4656000	4660000	put it in a cage, real cage-like,
4660000	4663000	and let it breed the fucking coal fumes.
4663000	4667000	Coal fumes go up, the bird takes a dirt nap.
4667000	4672000	Only it ain't no dirt in a cage.
4672000	4678000	Imagine being a fucking bird taking a dirt nap in a cage with no dirt.
4678000	4683000	Rather, a fucking immigrant suffer that fate personally.
4683000	4686000	But that's just me. I ain't going to suffer.
4686000	4692000	Hey, fuck you. I'm a Canadian fascist.
4692000	4696000	I love Canada. I don't want anybody coming in here and fucking it up.
4696000	4698000	That's pretty rare.
4698000	4701000	I'm sorry I ever fucking married you.
4701000	4704000	I'm sorry.
4704000	4708000	You stay in your special door.
4708000	4712000	It ain't so special. You could have built a better door.
4712000	4715000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4715000	4718000	You'll meet the little lady later.
4718000	4727000	She's, uh, quite a reveal.
4727000	4729000	Anyways...
4729000	4731000	Get back to your B-story!
4731000	4738000	God, not a beast. Don't dismiss. It ain't no fucking sitcom.
4738000	4740000	Not a B-story. Not a fucking...
4740000	4745000	What do you think, George Costanza's going to have a runner
4745000	4749000	while the hitchhiker's getting killed that gets cut over to him
4749000	4751000	and it's like...
4751000	4757000	B-story. Don't fucking insult me. That's immigrant shit.
4757000	4761000	Anyways, so this mining town, right?
4761000	4763000	Here's the thing.
4763000	4770000	Whole town runs on coal, dig?
4770000	4772000	Yes, coal. Coal is dug, yes, yes.
4772000	4778000	But you can't dig the coal if all the birds die, see?
4778000	4781000	So they get this idea, right?
4781000	4783000	The mining industry.
4783000	4789000	They think, let's put kids down there.
4789000	4798000	Cheaper than fucking birds, right?
4798000	4806000	And a kid's gonna react to coal fumes just as readily as a bird?
4806000	4810000	In point of fact, their lungs are notoriously weak.
4810000	4814000	They're probably a more accurate and beneficial metric of coal fumes
4814000	4817000	than a different species.
4817000	4821000	If it's too much for a kid, I should stop digging coal.
4821000	4824000	Look, I'm not defending the practice, okay?
4824000	4827000	These were Canadian kids.
4827000	4830000	They didn't deserve that fate.
4830000	4837000	And they're worth about 75% of American children these days.
4837000	4840000	So they did it for years, right?
4840000	4842000	And the coal town booms.
4842000	4845000	Look, you've seen it in the paper.
4845000	4848000	This town buried one story, though.
4848000	4852000	Timothy. Is that what I said?
4852000	4854000	Yes.
4854000	4857000	We're on pins and needles for Timothy.
4857000	4861000	I judged your 16 pages.
4861000	4865000	Look at me go.
4865000	4868000	Timothy.
4868000	4871000	I don't know.
4871000	4875000	The scientists didn't know where they found them.
4875000	4880000	And the test results didn't provide no clarity.
4880000	4884000	But this kid was, uh, different.
4884000	4887000	First time he went down,
4887000	4891000	he'd come up from the fume chamber,
4891000	4896000	saying, give me more.
4896000	4899000	The kid wouldn't die, see?
4899000	4903000	He just kept loving going down, deeper and deeper.
4903000	4907000	One after one, dozens after dozens,
4907000	4910000	the Canadian coal miners started to die
4910000	4914000	because Timothy wasn't dying.
4914000	4918000	By the time they caught on,
4918000	4920000	they grabbed their pickaxes,
4920000	4923000	but it wasn't coal they were gonna mine.
4923000	4928000	It was gonna be Timothy's soul.
4928000	4931000	At that point, he was living down in the bottom of the mines
4931000	4934000	where we called no man's land
4934000	4941000	because we hadn't yet had an inclusive mining operation.
4941000	4947000	It's now called nobody's land.
4947000	4948000	It's also closed.
4948000	4951000	Canada has a very good green energy policy.
4951000	4953000	And this is not about that.
4953000	4958000	But they went down pickaxes and torches in hand
4958000	4961000	and the other hand free.
4961000	4967000	The pickax is getting hot from the torch adjacent to it.
4967000	4971000	The custom made handles of the torch and pickax
4971000	4975000	doing their job of fitting snuggly into one hand
4975000	4977000	so that later they could be described
4977000	4979000	in the telling of the story
4979000	4984000	as having plural things in hand.
4984000	4990000	Without a second thought.
4990000	4994000	When they got down to nobody's land,
4994000	4998000	they saw something scarier than a thousand dead birds.
4998000	5002000	Something scarier than the sea of child bones
5002000	5008000	that had been created by the Canadian coal industry.
5008000	5012000	They saw Timothy's empty cage.
5012000	5016000	So anyways, on his anniversary,
5016000	5022000	people say they, what did you say that made me alarmed?
5022000	5024000	Your grandpa died?
5024000	5026000	Yeah, grandpa, grandpa died.
5026000	5029000	On Timothy's anniversary.
5029000	5031000	Oh my god, you're right.
5031000	5035000	They say he comes and he kills people.
5035000	5042000	And Timothy's last name, if I'm not mistaken, was Horton.
5042000	5047000	La, la, la, la, la.
5047000	5048000	Yeah.
5048000	5050000	How come you left off the part about the Horton?
5050000	5051000	Shut up.
5051000	5055000	I'm trying to catch up to a reference in here.
5055000	5058000	You fucking immigrant.
5058000	5060000	All right, look.
5060000	5062000	You've put up with enough.
5062000	5064000	I can repair your cuckoo clock.
5064000	5066000	I'll bump you ahead.
5066000	5071000	It's called the True Canadian Benefits Package.
5071000	5076000	A couple of brown people that want their clocks fixed
5076000	5079000	might find they're unfixable this season.
5079000	5081000	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
5081000	5085000	I'm racist.
5085000	5087000	As Canadians are wont to be.
5087000	5092000	No, just the characters that have a come up, it's coming.
5092000	5095000	I'm not a quintessential Canadian.
5095000	5096000	God damn right you're not.
5096000	5097000	Listen to my voice.
5097000	5098000	I'm a villain.
5098000	5099000	Jesus.
5099000	5102000	I don't mean to give notes from inside the story.
5102000	5105000	You suddenly thought maybe you thought I was doing something
5105000	5107000	that I wasn't doing.
5107000	5108000	No, I hear you, but...
5108000	5111000	I'm going to...time to reveal my wife.
5111000	5114000	Oh my God, where is she?
5114000	5118000	Now remember, you're the narrator of the story.
5118000	5120000	I just been, what do you call it?
5120000	5126000	Some kind of dialogue digression within your prose.
5126000	5137000	The story pays off as I open this door and you see my wife.
5137000	5142000	My God, a smile too wide for her face.
5142000	5147000	Now you see why he keeps me away.
5147000	5153000	Horrifying, horrifying but strangely arousing.
5153000	5157000	That's, hey doc, why are you a doc?
5157000	5169000	That's why they call it a cuckoo clock.
5169000	5171000	Oh yeah?
5171000	5174000	It's hard to improvise these.
5174000	5179000	They have to be written in order to have a punchy ending, right?
5179000	5181000	We try to have a punchy ending, yes.
5181000	5184000	So that's why they're called a cuckoo clock.
5184000	5185000	I see.
5185000	5194000	I think my grandfather didn't know that story and that's why he died.
5194000	5196000	Okay, that was a good one, all things considered.
5196000	5209000	That was fun.
5209000	5213000	How have we been doing this for seven years if that's what our stories are like?
5213000	5218000	If you try to make one up, that's what they're like.
5218000	5221000	I did want to mention one thing and I wanted to be cloying about it,
5221000	5224000	but it actually was impressive to me.
5224000	5228000	Like I said, I was following you when trigger warnings were invented
5228000	5231000	and then following you for the backlash and following you the whole time.
5231000	5234000	And you've never, whereas we've been podcasting the same amount of time
5234000	5237000	and I've just been hitting garbage cans and swerving around
5237000	5240000	and like, I don't want to hurt anybody, but I hurt everybody.
5240000	5243000	But you have a scripted podcast that's like,
5243000	5246000	you can watch the earth move beneath your podcast's feet.
5246000	5250000	But what emerges, I'm listening to your most recent season
5250000	5257000	and you did Pride Week and you did this like LGBT episode.
5257000	5263000	And it's like, honestly, there's a fear in the back of my head
5263000	5264000	when I think about this stuff.
5264000	5270000	I'm like, yeah, but just don't, you know, let's not have that be adding water
5270000	5273000	to something or feel like because the Nazis call it virtue signaling
5273000	5276000	and it just makes the, you know, it's like it truly,
5276000	5279000	I'm listening to like scripted horror podcasts
5279000	5283000	and it's like I'm not virtue signaling or white knighting
5283000	5285000	or whatever they call it when I say,
5285000	5289000	it really struck me that we gave voices,
5289000	5294000	gay perspectives and things like make shit like horror better
5294000	5298000	because either A, you have a classic story that's like a husband and wife,
5298000	5301000	but it's like a husband and husband and it's like all the more,
5301000	5303000	like because it's a horror story,
5303000	5305000	the focus is on this fucked up shit that's going on.
5305000	5308000	You're like, run, grab your husband and run
5308000	5310000	and you come through a visceral experience,
5310000	5315000	like having been trained neurologically to think of people
5315000	5319000	that are different as the same, which is like a healing,
5319000	5321000	that's one kind of good thing.
5321000	5324000	But then the other thing is like when the shit goes deep and dark
5324000	5328000	and earns those trigger warnings, there are like,
5328000	5332000	there was an author who was just talking about his,
5332000	5336000	it was like a weird, like there's a tradition in this format
5336000	5338000	where it's like the person is the unreliable narrator
5338000	5342000	who kind of like turns out to be your kidnapper or whatever
5342000	5344000	and kind of like, I don't know, I'm babbling,
5344000	5348000	but like would you take over and say anything about that?
5348000	5353000	Or like, what has been your experience?
5353000	5355000	I don't know if you're straight or gay or anything.
5355000	5358000	I've never bothered to ask because I've been evolved by your podcast.
5358000	5365000	But like whether you're, whatever category you might fit or not fit into,
5365000	5368000	what has been your experience with representation,
5368000	5371000	your obligations, your desires and things?
5371000	5374000	Well, one of the neat things about our show is that we have a cast
5374000	5378000	of voice actors, writers, producers, and they're from all around the world.
5378000	5381000	And they all record separately and send their parts in.
5381000	5386000	And we have a really strong representation from the LGBTQ community
5386000	5389000	just in the team that creates the show.
5389000	5392000	For you as a kind of incidental, like were you like a straight guy
5392000	5395000	in front of a microphone going like, I like horror, let's do this horror thing
5395000	5398000	and then one by one people are like, by the way, I'm such and such
5398000	5400000	and you're like, yes and?
5400000	5403000	And it's like the Muppet movie that works.
5403000	5406000	Yeah, it was never an issue. It was never at all.
5406000	5410000	And then as Dan mentioned, it seemed for some reason recently
5410000	5414000	we did some stories that just happened to have same sex couples.
5414000	5417000	It wasn't a heavy gay theme.
5417000	5419000	There was no gay sex or anything like that.
5419000	5423000	It's just two people driving down the road and they're two married men.
5423000	5425000	Being gay on the road.
5425000	5429000	Which can be a bit of a problem.
5429000	5433000	I saw a gay ghost staring at me.
5433000	5436000	It's not like you just add the word.
5436000	5439000	And yeah, so we did these stories and believe it or not
5439000	5443000	I got emails from people saying, what's with all the queer stuff?
5443000	5446000	Why do you have, you know, it adds nothing to the story.
5446000	5449000	Why do you have all these same sex things?
5449000	5452000	And it was right around that time that we had, as a team,
5452000	5455000	thinking about putting together for Pride Month
5455000	5458000	an episode that had every story would be written
5458000	5460000	by someone from the LGBTQ community.
5460000	5463000	And it was just, we're going to celebrate Pride Month.
5463000	5465000	Not because...
5469000	5473000	I just like that you pissed off somebody who complained.
5473000	5474000	Well, that's the thing.
5474000	5476000	And so I put a little disclaimer on the next episode,
5476000	5478000	the episode before the Pride episode,
5478000	5481000	and basically said, look, we will do these stories
5481000	5484000	and if you don't like them, you're free to not listen.
5484000	5488000	And I think I tried to inform our audience that, yeah,
5488000	5491000	we've got voice actors and people on the show
5491000	5495000	who, terrifyingly enough, are gay.
5495000	5497000	And yeah, we got some blowback from that.
5497000	5500000	There were people who canceled their subscriptions
5500000	5501000	and all that kind of stuff.
5501000	5504000	And they would never say, by the way, this isn't...
5504000	5507000	This is because I love freedom.
5507000	5511000	And I perceive these sort of...
5513000	5514000	When I get these signals,
5514000	5517000	they get ironically triggered by them
5517000	5519000	and go like, oh, political correctness is coming.
5519000	5521000	Because there's like a...
5521000	5525000	But I gotta say, as a pot-bellied 45-year-old
5525000	5528000	straight white dude who has nothing to gain or lose,
5528000	5531000	I honestly, and this may be the most insulting compliment
5531000	5533000	of all time, but it really struck me
5533000	5535000	as listening to that episode just yesterday
5535000	5539000	and was like, I would recommend to a fan where I was going,
5539000	5540000	like, you should listen to this.
5540000	5545000	It's like really well-produced, well-written horror stories
5545000	5547000	that have a modern context to them,
5547000	5551000	but they also have a classy foundation to them,
5551000	5554000	a respect for the audio format and stuff like that.
5554000	5555000	And I would go, actually,
5555000	5556000	if you're gonna start with anything,
5556000	5557000	listen to the LGBT...
5557000	5558000	It happens to be the LGBT.
5558000	5560000	I would say you'll find it that way,
5560000	5563000	but it wouldn't be because it just happens to be.
5563000	5566000	My point being that in addition to being inclusive,
5566000	5568000	it's not like a handicap parking space.
5568000	5570000	It's not this thing of like,
5570000	5572000	let's be proactive and break the cycle,
5572000	5573000	which is also fine,
5573000	5576000	but you've managed to gracefully do this thing
5576000	5578000	because you've had this commune of artists,
5578000	5581000	your people who love reading stories and writing stories,
5581000	5585000	they're all individuals, snowflakes, if you will.
5585000	5588000	And each of them comes to the table, I assume,
5588000	5590000	and going like, you know, could I go here, could I go there,
5590000	5592000	or could you represent this and that,
5592000	5593000	and you...
5593000	5596000	I'm psychically, osmotically interpreting are like me,
5596000	5598000	and that you would go, yeah,
5598000	5601000	because why would I put up a wall against that?
5601000	5605000	And the result is truly not obnoxious.
5605000	5606000	It's not saccharin.
5606000	5607000	It's not watered down.
5607000	5608000	It's anything.
5608000	5611000	It's like it has all this extra flavor to it
5611000	5614000	because it's something...
5614000	5617000	I mean, look, fear, xenophobia, sex, fear,
5617000	5619000	they all go kind of hand in hand, right?
5619000	5621000	It's different from comedy.
5622000	5626000	And I guess that's like my remaining discussion point is like,
5626000	5628000	what the hell is it with...
5628000	5629000	What do we...
5629000	5634000	In these times where we're actually trying to be sensitive to each other,
5634000	5637000	when the reality is that when we go to bed together
5637000	5640000	and when we speak around campfires to each other,
5640000	5643000	when we want to get visceral reactions from each other,
5643000	5645000	we want to be able to cross thresholds.
5645000	5649000	That's literally the definition of a story, crossing boundaries.
5649000	5651000	And yet in a very...
5651000	5653000	I'm not doing the old man thing where I'm like,
5653000	5656000	we can't have fun anymore because you're having fun,
5656000	5658000	but you're not hurting anybody.
5658000	5661000	It's very clear that you're not doing it in defiance.
5661000	5662000	It's like...
5662000	5663000	It's very...
5663000	5665000	Two things are very clear when I listen to that podcast.
5665000	5669000	You guys don't give a shit about whether or not somebody
5669000	5672000	might boycott or anything like that.
5672000	5674000	There's no pandering happening.
5674000	5676000	And the next thing that's clear is that you definitely
5676000	5678000	don't want to hurt anybody.
5678000	5681000	I don't know how you could impart to somebody
5681000	5682000	that we're listening.
5682000	5684000	Is there some key to the philosophy,
5684000	5686000	like the algorithm that you run,
5686000	5688000	or is it simply you don't think about it
5688000	5690000	and over thought doesn't happen?
5690000	5693000	Well, I fully agree, Dan, that I am pretty fucking awesome.
5695000	5697000	No, no, no, come on, come on.
5698000	5700000	No, it's definitely the latter.
5700000	5701000	It's just...
5701000	5702000	I don't care.
5702000	5704000	And I know I've heard that lately.
5704000	5706000	Some people say that as a straight person,
5706000	5708000	if I say, look, I don't care if you're gay or straight
5708000	5710000	or trans, and they say, well, that's not right.
5710000	5712000	You've got to be a little more sensitive.
5712000	5714000	But, no, to me, like you said,
5714000	5717000	sex and horror are very intermingled.
5717000	5718000	They're very...
5718000	5720000	Tell me about it.
5722000	5723000	Maybe the more interesting...
5723000	5725000	What's the kind of stuff that...
5725000	5727000	You get submissions.
5727000	5729000	So, what are the...
5729000	5731000	And you can say, I don't want to talk about this
5731000	5733000	because I don't want you to know how the sausage is made.
5734000	5735000	But...
5737000	5739000	Do you have lines that you draw where...
5740000	5742000	Rules in your head that you run things through,
5742000	5744000	so you go, you know what, this is...
5746000	5748000	Go ahead, I'll stop asking the question
5748000	5749000	so you can answer it.
5750000	5752000	There aren't a lot of hard and fast rules.
5754000	5756000	As I mentioned earlier, we'll do a story,
5756000	5759000	if it implies, let's say, a sexual assault or a rape,
5759000	5761000	something that isn't gratuitous.
5761000	5763000	We're not going to have a 12-minute segment
5763000	5765000	where you hear a person describe
5765000	5768000	the graphic moments of them being raped
5768000	5769000	and stuff like that.
5769000	5771000	So, we guard that line.
5771000	5774000	But I remember way back, I think, in Season 3,
5774000	5776000	we did a story, it was called Autopilot,
5776000	5779000	and it basically told the story
5779000	5783000	of something that you hear in the news every summer.
5783000	5785000	And it's horrifyingly tragic,
5785000	5788000	and it has to do with children being left in cars
5788000	5789000	in the summertime.
5789000	5792000	And so, that's a story that I probably wouldn't do today
5792000	5795000	because fearing all the blowback and people saying...
5795000	5798000	We heard back from after that, we did that show,
5798000	5800000	somebody emailed me and said,
5800000	5802000	are you going to keep doing stories
5802000	5804000	where children are murdered?
5804000	5806000	And I thought, well, the child wasn't murdered,
5806000	5808000	it was a horrifying accident,
5808000	5810000	but that's how his mind, as a father,
5810000	5811000	he thought that.
5811000	5814000	So, you know, we like pushing people,
5814000	5817000	and we say right at the top of every show,
5817000	5819000	as Dan has so gracefully pointed out tonight
5819000	5821000	with his imitation of me.
5821000	5826000	Yeah, I say, we do tales to frighten and disturb.
5826000	5830000	And that key word, disturb, is, I think, lost on a lot of people.
5830000	5833000	We want people not just to be chills up the spine,
5833000	5835000	ooh, that's spooky, but we want people
5835000	5838000	to be genuinely uncomfortable and unsettled.
5838000	5840000	Yeah, and I think you phrase it in a way
5840000	5842000	that it's the most elegant kind of trigger warning
5842000	5844000	that you could give, which is like,
5844000	5846000	it's something like, to paraphrase it,
5846000	5848000	you're coming here to be frightened and disturbed
5848000	5850000	on purpose or something like that.
5850000	5853000	There's like, you're coming here to do that.
5853000	5855000	You're choosing to be frightened and disturbed
5855000	5856000	for your own entertainment.
5856000	5857000	Right, there it is, yeah.
5857000	5858000	That's a big part of it.
5858000	5860000	So, yeah, they choose that.
5860000	5865000	Do you, I mean, wow, oh boy, what, do you,
5865000	5868000	is it audio or horror that's more,
5868000	5870000	like if you had an opportunity to do more
5870000	5875000	than the audio version of it,
5875000	5878000	or would you, you're like, well, I like the scary stuff,
5878000	5882000	or are you more like, I like audio storytelling
5882000	5884000	and it doesn't necessarily have to be horror,
5884000	5887000	but that's the hot dog of audio.
5887000	5890000	Yeah, I think a horror, or audio and horror
5890000	5893000	go together better than probably any other format.
5893000	5895000	Again, just what I mentioned earlier
5895000	5897000	about using your imagination and getting cues
5897000	5899000	from the story to involve yourself in the story,
5899000	5902000	but no, I, you know, doing it for seven years,
5902000	5904000	I'd love to branch out.
5904000	5907000	I had the thrill of being on a podcast
5907000	5910000	produced by the aforementioned Alex Aldea
5910000	5912000	about, called Deadly Manners,
5912000	5915000	and it was a ten-part series, thank you very much,
5915000	5918000	and it was, it's basically like the movie Clue.
5918000	5920000	It's a comedy, whodunit, murder mystery,
5920000	5922000	and being able to do comedy
5922000	5924000	and play a bit of an over-the-top,
5924000	5928000	has been washed out actor in a role that was written,
5928000	5932000	especially for me, was a real thrill,
5932000	5933000	and that was a lot of fun.
5933000	5935000	I think horror will always be my first love,
5935000	5937000	but yeah, it'd be fun to branch out
5937000	5939000	and do voices on, you know, like animation,
5939000	5941000	Rick and Morty and all that stuff, so.
5941000	5942000	Ha ha ha.
5942000	5943000	Whoo!
5943000	5944000	Whoo!
5946000	5947000	Is this on?
5947000	5949000	Well, it's funny you should mention that, David,
5949000	5953000	because I actually have, now I know I did some goofing,
5953000	5958000	I improvised some stuff, but I did write and polish
5958000	5963000	a story in which the character is you, David Cummings,
5963000	5967000	telling a story called, and I'm telling you
5967000	5969000	because you'll have to introduce it,
5969000	5972000	author Dan Harmon will tell the story,
5972000	5977000	the title is Why I Won't Ever Go Back to Rick and Morty.
5980000	5982000	So then you do the introduction,
5982000	5984000	and then I'll be you telling the story.
5984000	5987000	I'm me introducing you as me.
5988000	5992000	In our final tale, author...
5992000	5994000	She's like, music, what's up, man? Come on, man.
5994000	5996000	Goddamn music.
6000000	6001000	Hey, wait, sorry.
6001000	6003000	Just before we do this, could I give a shout-out real quick?
6003000	6004000	I'm so sorry.
6004000	6006000	Yeah, I know, I forgot about the shout-out.
6006000	6008000	We had a fan that was gonna come,
6008000	6011000	they're not from here, and they're gonna come and see the show,
6011000	6014000	but they had a health incident that involved, I believe,
6014000	6017000	a brain tumor, which made them had to cancel their plans.
6017000	6019000	They wanted to be here and couldn't,
6019000	6022000	so if you want to help out Megan,
6022000	6024000	who's dealing with some real shit,
6024000	6031000	and her friend Ruth, you go to the gf.me slash u slash mghbja.
6031000	6039000	That's a GoFundMe, it's gf.me slash u slash mghbja.
6039000	6041000	Sorry, thank you so much, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
6041000	6044000	but that's the worst, worst way to end a show.
6044000	6045000	I'm so sorry.
6045000	6047000	Sorry you couldn't be here.
6047000	6051000	I'm sorry to do this to you, and now, back to the outro.
6053000	6054000	Sorry, sorry, everybody.
6054000	6056000	Thank you so much, I'm sorry you couldn't make it.
6058000	6060000	In our final tale,
6061000	6066000	we meet a man involved in producing a pretty funny show.
6067000	6070000	Author Dan Harmon shares with us a tale
6070000	6074000	horrifyingly enough about said show,
6074000	6076000	and it's a story entitled,
6076000	6080000	Why I'll Never Go Back to Rick and Morty.
6082000	6084000	My name is David Cummings.
6089000	6093000	I'm an actor, primarily working in the Canadian area.
6094000	6096000	I don't toot my own horn.
6096000	6099000	I like to have lots of sex.
6100000	6103000	With my big Canadian dick.
6112000	6115000	I enjoy the company of the ladies
6115000	6119000	and a nice six-pack of Moosehead.
6119000	6120000	Well done.
6120000	6121000	Mickey's Big Mouth?
6121000	6123000	What do we drink?
6123000	6124000	Molson.
6124000	6125000	Molson.
6125000	6127000	Molson ice.
6128000	6132000	But what I've always wanted to do
6132000	6137000	was be a voice actor on an Adult Swim cartoon
6137000	6139000	called Rick and Morty.
6139000	6144000	I never thought I could be a candidate for such a job.
6144000	6149000	Little old me sitting in my shack on the North Pole.
6149000	6156000	But it's healthy to fantasize,
6156000	6160000	and so I would pet my husky
6161000	6164000	and look at my sled
6166000	6171000	while whittling my kitchen furniture
6172000	6176000	out of my grandmother's snowshoes,
6176000	6181000	which she donated to me after retiring from vaudeville.
6183000	6185000	Canadian vaudeville.
6186000	6189000	Which, all right, no, I'm not going to tell you about that.
6189000	6191000	That's a different story.
6191000	6194000	So it was quite a surprise to me
6194000	6198000	when my message on the local Moose Board
6199000	6201000	got responded to
6201000	6205000	with a strange handwritten scrawl.
6206000	6208000	I asked the bartender,
6208000	6210000	had anyone been a ruined?
6217000	6219000	I don't know why it's so...
6219000	6221000	Why am I allowed to...
6221000	6222000	I don't know.
6222000	6223000	Why am I abusive?
6223000	6224000	It doesn't...
6224000	6226000	It's because you're nice and so I'm abusing you.
6226000	6228000	It makes no sense.
6228000	6231000	I gave you a big dick, remember?
6232000	6234000	I don't think of you as a...
6234000	6236000	I'm thinking of me as the bad person.
6236000	6237000	Like, that's my...
6237000	6238000	Okay, all right, sorry.
6240000	6246000	The bartender's answer was even more weird
6247000	6249000	than my question.
6253000	6254000	No.
6254000	6256000	Wait, no, weirder.
6256000	6260000	It's funny you should ask because no.
6260000	6265000	When I got home to my answering machine,
6265000	6268000	I had the strangest message.
6268000	6273000	It said it was from an Emmy-winning television producer.
6273000	6276000	But I couldn't tell if it was fake.
6276000	6280000	My friends like to play Canadian pranks.
6283000	6285000	But it went like this.
6291000	6294000	How's it going there, eh?
6294000	6295000	I hear you're...
6295000	6298000	What, you're gonna be on the old Rick and Morty there?
6298000	6299000	Oh, jeez, eh?
6299000	6301000	So, yeah, I'll come over with some Orlson
6301000	6303000	and we'll talk about it there, peep.
6303000	6307000	I backed up from the machine with horror.
6307000	6311000	If that message was from a producer of Rick and Morty,
6311000	6313000	why would he be coming over?
6315000	6319000	And why would he be speaking like me?
6321000	6324000	I ran to the front door
6324000	6328000	and rubbed it with my hand on the cold window,
6328000	6334000	unsticking my flesh from the frozen pane of glass.
6334000	6337000	I poked my eyes outside and saw...
6337000	6339000	Anyways, later I was...
6339000	6343000	Look, it's getting late.
6343000	6349000	I found a plane ticket in a box with a thumb.
6350000	6353000	I would have described it longer and more scary,
6353000	6355000	but I gotta get the bullet points
6355000	6357000	because we gotta hit this.
6357000	6360000	I found a plane ticket in a box with a thumb.
6360000	6363000	There was a thumb, there was a human thumb,
6363000	6370000	and a plane ticket flying in to the production office.
6370000	6374000	I wondered to myself, what should I do?
6374000	6379000	I didn't know what I was about to see.
6380000	6383000	When I got off the elevator,
6383000	6387000	four children in clown makeup
6387000	6390000	with smiles whiter than their faces.
6390000	6393000	That's like big thing in...
6393000	6396000	Everyone's got smiles.
6396000	6399000	Greeted me with macchiatos.
6402000	6405000	You're here to work on the show.
6405000	6409000	I couldn't stand the feelings in my boots.
6409000	6412000	I wanted to run away,
6412000	6416000	but I also needed to be polite.
6419000	6421000	That sounds good, I said,
6421000	6425000	and they took me back to the VO booth,
6425000	6429000	where what I saw will stay with me
6429000	6433000	for the rest of my life.
6433000	6437000	Three hundred pounds of human intestine
6437000	6442000	in a writhing mass of aborted foot bone,
6442000	6446000	surgically altered, all of it smiling
6446000	6452000	with smiles and children bigger than the children's smiles,
6452000	6458000	lips curled in a surgical foot intestine
6458000	6462000	with aborted things and a little implication
6462000	6466000	of the threat of rape but not taking pleasure in it.
6468000	6471000	A writhing sea.
6471000	6476000	I dove in because I felt pressured,
6476000	6479000	and the microphone was turned on
6479000	6482000	and I said, I'm David Cummings.
6482000	6487000	Hello, there was no script, I just said it.
6492000	6496000	Silence entered the room,
6496000	6501000	and all I heard over the speaker was,
6501000	6507000	that's good, can we do another take?
6508000	6511000	Okay, no, that's not a good ending.
6511000	6514000	Well, no, no, no, I like that.
6514000	6516000	Here's my favorite kind of ending.
6516000	6520000	Rewind to the sea of intestines and bones,
6520000	6525000	but the one thing that will always be the reason
6525000	6529000	I will never forget what I was looking at,
6529000	6533000	the one thing that I can never explain,
6533000	6536000	no matter how hard I try,
6536000	6542000	the reason I am posting this to Reddit from an asylum
6542000	6551000	is because the engineer had a hat on with a maple leaf.
6552000	6557000	There's always the one thing that will keep me up at night
6557000	6560000	is that he knew my name,
6560000	6562000	and then there's like a punch line.
6562000	6567000	And that is why he'll never go back to Rick and Morty
6567000	6572000	and why we bid you tonight on Harbontown, ladies and gentlemen.
6572000	6576000	We bid you good night. Thank you so much.
6576000	6578000	David Cummings, everybody.
6578000	6582000	David Cummings, let him hear you.
6582000	6584000	Spencer Crittenden, Dan Harmon,
6584000	6590000	Zach McKeever, Nolan Fabricez, Sarah Hill, Chris Fora.
6590000	6592000	Ivan Brandon-Johnson, thank you all so much
6592000	6596000	for coming to the lovely downtown dynasty theater.
6596000	6600000	He has been the same since the beginning
6600000	6603000	Yeah, we're all players in this game
6603000	6609000	I'm willing, I keep on losing my mind
6609000	6616000	I can't find it, but I don't really mind
6616000	6622000	I'm just a loser, but I gotta like it
6622000	6627000	Come and give it a try
6627000	6629000	Did you get any of that?
6629000	6632000	It's a good show
