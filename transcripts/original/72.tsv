0	18080	Oh yeah, I'm in that kind of mood you guys, a hardcore mood.
18080	20880	It's time for the five most magical of words.
20880	32880	Please welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harmentown, everybody, Dan Harman.
32880	36880	Thank you very much.
36880	39880	What a warm welcome.
39880	45880	Alright, we've got some guests, we've got some guests tonight.
45880	51880	I was at the Creative Arts Emmys tonight, did a little presentation with Joel McHale.
51880	58880	I don't think there's anything to talk about there, it was fun at the Nokia Theater.
58880	61880	I own a tux now, I finally bought a tux so I don't keep renting them.
61880	63880	Is that televised or non-televised?
63880	68880	It'll be televised on the FXX network, FX has now created an FXX network.
68880	71880	So it's non-televised.
71880	77880	I mean, you know, from what I've heard actually, you'd think it was just sort of like,
77880	82880	let's just start another thing like MTV2 or whatever, but it sounds like Landgraf,
82880	88880	who's the genius, one of the few suits that I really respect and love, John Landgraf over at FX.
88880	94880	It sounds like he's moving all the comedy over to FXX, that's what I've heard.
94880	98880	Because he wants FX to be associated with their dramas.
98880	100880	I mean, they're fucking, they're murdering it over there.
100880	105880	That guy is like really, and Nick Grad and the people that work at FX,
105880	109880	they're a true scientific demonstration of the fact that it's not just bullshit when you say,
109880	113880	hey, just be creatively respectful to the creatives and stay out of their way,
113880	116880	like make deals with the people you want to work with and kind of,
116880	120880	they pay lip service to that philosophy and they execute it.
120880	124880	They only help, they say, look, we're not giving you a ton of money,
124880	127880	you can do whatever you want here and look at all the programming on FX.
127880	128880	It's fucking amazing.
128880	130880	They win all kinds of awards, I don't know, whatever.
130880	134880	I can't suck their little wieners enough.
134880	137880	Now I call them little wieners.
137880	139880	I wanted to colloquialize it a little more,
139880	141880	accidentally said they had little wieners.
141880	145880	And now that'll be the quote in the headline.
145880	149880	Dan Harmon bashes jabs flip-flops.
149880	151880	Dan Harmon took a shot at.
151880	153880	Dan Harmon jab jibs.
153880	155880	Dan Harmon bashes.
155880	160880	Dan Harmon peen-pan-boom-bow.
160880	162880	It's like I'm a professional wrestler.
162880	165880	I just say things and just go, can I have an omelet?
165880	168880	Dan Harmon jabs omelets.
168880	170880	Yeah, well, I need to eat it.
170880	172880	I had to eat it, I had to put a fork in it.
172880	176880	Dan Harmon sticks it to his omelet.
176880	178880	Click here for the details.
178880	183880	Oh, could I have a little penny for my Bacardi hat while you're clicking it?
183880	190880	Don't you know, as long as you're here, reading about how Dan Harmon jibs and jabs.
190880	193880	What is the difference between a jib and a jab?
193880	195880	I'm not sure.
195880	196880	It doesn't matter, man.
196880	198880	Did you wear your eye harmon with your tuxedo?
198880	200880	Of course not, no.
200880	205880	Now Dan, that's an opportunity to fucking market the eye harmon.
205880	209880	It would have been badass of me or whatever the opposite of badass is
209880	212880	to wear the eye harmon to the Emmys on a stage.
212880	214880	But I felt like it would be distracting.
214880	216880	I had a bit to do.
216880	218880	It's not like I'm going to be meeting it up there.
218880	220880	I know I said up here, you can't pick and choose.
220880	223880	You've got to wear the eye harmon, you've got to make it work.
223880	225880	Did you miss it while it was away?
225880	227880	Yeah, for a couple of times.
227880	230880	But there was a teleprompter.
230880	239880	Anyways, congratulations to everyone that won a creative arts Emmy.
239880	242880	They're still gold.
242880	245880	And the real Emmys are next week.
245880	248880	Jeff, did you know that Feral Audio is a network?
248880	249880	It's a whole network.
249880	250880	The what?
250880	251880	Yeah.
251880	253880	Harmontown is just one of many Feral Audio programs.
253880	257880	I was under the mistaken assumption that we were the only podcast there is.
257880	258880	No, no.
258880	260880	I mean, we could be if we wanted to.
260880	262880	We chose like Han Solo choosing to be part of the rebellion.
262880	266880	We chose to be part of the alliance
266880	269880	in hopes of taking down whatever the Death Star is.
269880	270880	I assume lack of listenership.
270880	274880	What's in it for you and me?
274880	277880	Han Solo, I believe, was paid for his services.
277880	279880	Well, see, that's the thing.
279880	280880	That's where you're getting wrong.
280880	285880	Han Solo, that was him still being regular Han Solo.
285880	289880	The celebrated pussy Han Solo from the end of Star Wars
289880	291880	is the one who's going, okay, I got my money.
291880	293880	Actually, that's not true, is it?
293880	294880	No.
294880	297880	He got his money at the top of Empire.
297880	298880	These guys don't even know.
298880	301880	They're like, which one had the Squeebsquab in it?
301880	303880	And I don't even know who you're talking about.
303880	304880	Who's Squeebsquab?
304880	308880	Which race did he malign?
308880	312880	Which weirdly racist CG character are you talking about?
312880	313880	Squeebsquab?
313880	314880	I don't know.
314880	317880	In my day, there was flesh and blood on camera.
317880	320880	Dan Harmon, Jim Jap, Squeebsquab.
320880	331880	Click here to hear the real audio from the Jimin and Jabin.
331880	336880	One of our newest brethren at the Feral Audio Network.
336880	339880	I looked at it.
339880	340880	He's a partner of our friend.
340880	341880	Do you know James Adomian?
341880	342880	Did you know that guy?
342880	343880	He's from Channel.
343880	344880	He's a Channel 101 alum.
344880	345880	He's out in their periphery.
345880	348880	He's a very, very, very super talented, funny guy.
348880	354880	He does incredible impressions.
354880	358880	You probably haven't seen this, but there's that show.
358880	364880	Marc Maron took WTF, his sort of Elan from that,
364880	366880	and he's doing this IFC show, Maron.
366880	369880	And then they did this thing on the web called Maron in Space
369880	371880	where James Adomian is playing Marc Maron.
371880	373880	And it's really fucking funny.
373880	376880	It's the most incredible impression.
376880	378880	It's an impression of Marc Maron.
378880	379880	It's really, really fun to watch.
379880	381880	It's just Marc Maron flying around in space.
381880	385880	Anyways, his partner, who produced that with him,
385880	386880	probably wrote it.
386880	387880	I don't know.
387880	388880	We'll ask him for the details.
388880	390880	But he has a podcast in the Feral Audio Network.
390880	391880	It's called Don't Ever Change.
391880	393880	And we're going to bring him up right now and talk about it.
393880	397880	His name is John Roy.
397880	402880	Hello, John.
402880	403880	Hi.
403880	404880	How are you?
404880	405880	I'm fine.
405880	406880	I'm in.
406880	407880	I'm a bad interviewer.
407880	408880	But I'm interested about your podcast
408880	409880	because it's called Don't Ever Change.
409880	410880	And I haven't listened to it yet.
410880	411880	But specifically, you have guests on.
411880	412880	And you talk about the person that they were in high school.
412880	413880	That's it.
413880	414880	It's all about high school.
414880	415880	So we've had Jonah Ray on.
415880	416880	We had Matt Myra, Sean Patton.
416880	417880	We've got Howard Kramer coming up.
417880	418880	We just did Ron Funch's.
418880	419880	It's a lot of comedians.
419880	420880	It's a lot of comedians.
420880	421880	It's a lot of comedians.
421880	422880	It's a lot of comedians.
422880	423880	It's a lot of comedians.
423880	424880	It's a lot of comedians.
424880	425880	It's a lot of comedians.
425880	426880	It's a lot of comedians.
426880	427880	It's a lot of comedians.
427880	428880	We've had Matt Myra, Sean Patton.
428880	429880	We've got Howard Kramer coming up.
429880	430880	We just did Ron Funch's.
430880	434960	It's a lot of comedians just talking about what they were like in high school.
434960	435960	What their town was like.
435960	437460	What kind of the feel of that.
437460	440840	And then any weird stories like Jonah Ray got in a fight with the Samoan guy.
440840	443580	The Samoan guy ended up falling down the stairs without Jonah doing anything.
443580	445720	And then they expelled Jonah from high school.
445720	447640	Like, it's like weird stories like that.
447640	448920	Because the dude was on the football team.
448920	452280	So Jonah had to leave the school because he fell down the stairs essentially.
452280	453660	So it's like weird stories like that.
453660	454660	We just put them in the top.
454660	457540	And it would upset the balance for him to stay because it would have, Jonah Ray would
457540	461100	have, would be the guy that beat up a Samoan guy.
461100	462500	People would be gunning for it, man.
462500	463500	Like he'd have to defend it.
463500	464500	I don't even know.
464500	466900	I think you go straight to the top of you knock a Samoan down the stairs.
466900	468100	I don't want to.
468100	469100	That's yeah.
469100	470780	Then you just Mr. Saman, then Tyson and you're done.
470780	471780	I think like you're pretty.
471780	475780	In terms of, in terms of high school politics, I think you're, I think you're finished.
475780	478500	You're Walter White, like season five.
478500	481020	I took the Samoan out, you know, tread lightly.
481020	484780	At my high school, at my high school, there was a girl that, and she was, she was big
484780	489860	and she was in the Crips and she beat up three guys from another gang.
489860	490860	She was Samoan.
490860	495300	Every detail that story gets better and better, like a ladder.
495300	499220	She was as big as a house and she was very sweet, but she got, it was a fight broke out
499220	500660	and she beat up three guys.
500660	502700	One on three, full all three.
502700	507340	And I won't say her name, but she, she in front of an AMPM gas station, she just boxed
507340	511260	down three other dudes and like handily, like, there's not gonna be four women who all did
511260	512260	that.
512260	513260	Which one of us is he talking about?
513260	514260	I won't say the name.
514260	515260	So I guess.
515260	519140	Well, I mean, yeah, people that went to my high school, they know who she is and I wish
519140	520140	her well.
520140	527980	If you're listening and you're Samoan and you've, and you're not a bad-ass, like feel
527980	532900	free to write into the show and go like, this is a offensive stereotype, but like, I mean,
532900	534780	sooner or later we'll get around to that, right?
534780	538220	Like we're, we're making good headway into our Roddenberry vision of tomorrow where pretty
538220	542380	soon it'll be not okay to say Samoans are bad-asses, but as, as of press time, I'm
542380	544860	sad to say I don't meet enough Samoans in my life anymore.
544860	545860	I think that's part of it.
545860	549940	It's an obscure group, but whenever you hear the word Samoan, it's in reference to somebody
549940	556460	beating the, like, that's usually in professional, like there's a Samoan boxer, a Samoan wrestler,
556460	560380	a Samoan, or a Samoan kid from your high school that was like a quarterback or something.
560380	566060	Like they, they, they, they color between the lines, but they're, they're, they're, they're
566060	567060	unstoppable.
567060	569060	They're juggernaut people.
570060	573940	Again, if that's, I can't believe it's almost like in a role playing game when certain
573940	577220	races get certain bonuses, like you have a plus two strength, if you're a dwarf, like
577220	581860	we were really had that for human groups, maybe Samoans get like, let's, let's, let's
581860	582860	clean that up.
582860	584060	I'm assuming it can't be true.
584060	589220	I'm sure I'm assuming that's, that's perfectly racist and like, like tweet me or tumble me
589220	590220	or whatever you want to say.
590220	595660	I am a, I am a very, very mild, like, like, like, but that's the other thing though is
595660	601500	it's like, like, like, um, they're, they're, I feel like good naturedness is also thrown
601500	602500	in there.
602500	605220	Like it's like happy people who could beat you up and aren't, they're going to hang out
605220	606220	and have fun.
606220	607220	That's part of it.
607220	610900	It's not like, it's not like they eat a lot of their diet is basically root vegetables.
610900	618220	And that's the, if you're a, if you're a, if you're a scrawny, clumsy, uh, mean, like,
618220	623860	like, like, like, like, like short tempered, ineffective, uh, bully who always gets his
623860	628940	ass kicked and your Samoan, we'd love to hear from you so we can get, just end this.
628940	633380	If you're a Samoan, you've ever been the head in the arms length bully, classic bully thing,
633380	637660	and you're unable to punch that guy and you flail away in the air, then yeah, that's cool.
637660	639780	That'll help us know that people are just people.
639780	645860	I can't believe it took us 72 or so harm in towns to get to Samoans.
645860	649700	It's not like I'm operating with a scalpel, I'm sort of just keep banging a shovel on
649700	650700	the wall.
650700	653260	I'm like, I wish black people liked me.
653260	654260	That's the way to do it.
654260	655260	I think that's very forgetful.
655260	660940	And I tend to repeat myself and I, uh, anyways, uh, so John Roy, how long have you been doing
660940	663500	this podcast with people talk about themselves in high school?
663500	665980	We've taped about tapes, Jesus Christ.
665980	669540	No tape was ever used ever in any podcast, but I'm 39.
669540	673620	So I still say for everything we've been doing it about, uh, we've done about 10 episodes,
673620	675660	but we've put out about six of them.
675660	677260	So really recently we just started it.
677260	679060	We started it all in the new studio.
679060	682820	So we recorded everyone up there in Burbank and, uh, it's been great.
683180	684980	Do you, that's my studio.
684980	686540	Oh, well, well, thank you.
686540	687540	Yeah.
687540	690300	Uh, Jim, Jim, Jim, it's pretty good, man.
690300	691300	I just hope people are enjoying it.
691300	692300	People love it.
692300	694780	They, you can tell when they walk in like, oh, there's no visible mothballs.
694780	695780	This is good.
695780	699380	Like a lot of times you report, you record podcasts in like under a Murphy bed.
699380	700380	Like it can be bad.
700380	701380	Like, you don't really know.
701380	702780	So they like it.
702780	703780	Yeah.
703780	708660	I'm trying to become like the Howard Hughes of zero profit industry.
708660	710300	This was my first move.
710300	713580	Skip directly to the urine and jars without the money part in the middle.
713580	714580	I think.
714580	715580	Yeah.
715580	716580	Yeah.
716580	717580	Yeah.
717580	718580	Yeah.
718580	719580	I was, you're hitting in charge when I was 16.
719580	720580	I think that's why I got fixated on Howard Hughes.
720580	721580	I'm like, you could make money doing this.
721580	722580	The answer is no.
722580	726700	No, but I'll figure it out first, but oh, fuck, fuck, God damn it.
726700	728500	But so you've recorded 10 of them.
728500	729780	You've done 10 of these interviews.
729780	732980	Like I'm curious if they're like, are there patterns emerging?
732980	733980	Yeah.
733980	734980	Yeah, absolutely.
734980	738540	Um, you know, there's kind of a, uh, you know, a lot of the people I would say over
738540	742500	now, we've, we've probably had most of the people were really fairly unpopular in high
742500	744140	school that became comedians.
744140	746260	But then every now and then you'll get one anomaly.
746260	750140	Like Jay Larson was like the biggest stud of his entire school.
750140	751140	And he's also super funny.
751140	756100	So, but I'd say about for most of the most part, you get a fairly unpopular guy who learned
756100	760380	that all that shit didn't matter when he discovered either music or comedy or something.
760380	764060	And then by about like 25 or so, he's pretty cool.
764060	765060	And now he's an idiot.
765300	768900	Do you think, which chicken lays which egg there or which egg lays which chicken?
768900	774820	Is it, are people that are destined to play guitar or paint something well or make people
774820	775820	laugh?
775820	779020	Are they like, are their brains shaped differently?
779020	782060	Therefore they're not as facile at high school politics.
782060	786220	Or is it just like, Hey, somebody's got to be the dork and it's you.
786220	789500	Therefore you're going to end up drawing apples better.
789500	790500	Probably not the latter.
790500	794380	I feel like, like, like there are certain personality traits and skills you have to
794380	795740	have to be funny.
795740	799580	And you can get the impetus to drive you to get those skills in different ways.
799580	801780	If you are unpopular, it's like a defense mechanism.
801780	804580	Like I can't beat these guys up, but I can make fun of the teacher.
804580	805580	They'll all laugh at that.
805580	807580	I think I have some kind of anti-fear power.
807580	808580	Yeah, you go where the heat is.
808580	809580	Yeah.
809580	811060	And then they're like, Oh, maybe he's got something to him.
811060	814300	Or you could be super popular at school, but you got to ship all home life.
814300	817940	And the only way to make your dad fucking pay attention is you learn how to get this
817940	818940	funny thing going.
818940	823220	So I think there's a lot of ways that will take the guy who has the aptitude for it,
823220	826660	and maybe you should try, if you said something right now, maybe everybody will laugh.
826660	827660	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
827660	829740	Is the same go for male and female comics?
829740	833220	We are just about to have our first female guest coming up.
833220	835020	We're going to have Emily Gordon on.
835020	840020	So that'll be the first opportunity to be like, Hey, are we learning universal things
840020	844940	or are we learning just boys club cry baby in the room with quadrophenia in his earphone
844940	845940	screen?
845940	846940	Why don't you like me?
846940	849900	Like, is that, is that just a male thing or is that an everybody thing?
849900	850900	I don't know.
850900	853020	That's something I've wondered if it's like, I felt like, you know, that's, that's kind
853020	857500	of this, this question has been like very delicately trod on territory is like, you
857500	860900	know, like, you know, uh, female comics versus male comics and stuff.
860900	865420	And I just felt like for me, the male class clowns were rewarded for it.
865420	867500	The female class clowns were punished for it.
867500	870660	Like the teachers shut them off.
870660	873100	The reinforcement was different or the other classmates did.
873100	878380	It was not, it was not as okay for a gal in my junior high in high school to kind of wisecrack
878380	879380	for some reason.
879380	880380	Like, I don't know where it came from.
880380	884980	If it was everybody or from the top down, but I'd be curious to, I'm going to ask that
884980	887140	very question and we'll, we'll find out.
887140	888140	That sounds fascinating.
888140	889140	The answer to that.
889140	892340	Well, that'll be, I mean, and she'll be able to really bring, uh, yeah, she'll, you'll,
892340	896260	you'll make up for, for 10 dudes interviews with her because she's like, she's also trained
896260	898060	in the whole thinking about all that stuff.
898060	899060	Right.
899060	900060	Yeah.
900060	901060	No, we want anyone thinking about anything.
901060	903060	I mean, a lot of times our podcast is like, what is you eating Burger King?
903060	904060	Oh, fucking all that shit.
904060	905060	Chicle, chicken sandwich.
905060	906060	Oh yeah.
906060	907060	Chicken sandwich.
907060	910060	Like we need to get, we need to get like a little bit more intellectual discourse.
911060	914900	That's kind of like Harpett's town, it's a little like Harpett's town.
914900	920260	Girls are definitely socialized to like, uh, socialize, like, right?
920260	924660	Like guys are told, uh, at least maybe this is a generational thing and we're changing
924660	928860	it now, but it's like, it's, it's always been the thing of like, like guys are told, don't
928860	930300	change your mind about anything.
930300	931300	That's a form of weakness.
931300	935420	So you have these weird arguments with guys about like, oh, you said you hated the matrix.
935420	936420	What's up, fucker?
937420	941420	And it's like, guys have emotional reactions to that stuff and go like, no, I said, but
941420	943420	I said, I didn't like any Keanu Reeves for me.
943420	945420	He did a good job with the matrix, okay?
945420	946420	I'll give him that.
946420	947420	I'll give him that.
947420	950420	You could be the biggest nerd in the world, but you're having this like male socialized
950420	951420	response.
951420	954420	Yeah, but even though no one's throwing any punches and no one could if it ever came to
954420	955420	that.
955420	956420	And the stakes bring me lower.
956420	957420	That's your opinion of the matrix.
957420	958420	You can change it.
958420	959420	Yeah.
959420	960420	You can change it.
960420	961420	I used to like the matrix, now I don't.
961420	962420	Good, fine.
962420	963420	Are we getting food?
963420	964420	What the fuck?
964420	965420	I don't care.
965420	969320	I think he would pick the diametric opposite just if he believed it or not, just to make
969320	970780	it a more fun argument.
970780	971680	Was he Canadian?
971680	973020	Was he Canadian?
973020	977420	He was actually Nigerian, actually, but the maybe they were colonialism.
977420	981840	Maybe it's just a British comedy thing that I realized.
981840	986900	So if you said I like Metallica, even though he basically likes Metallica, he'll go, Metallica
986900	991880	is the worst band of all time just to make you to make that, take that stand for the
991880	992880	reason.
992880	993880	I don't like that.
993880	994880	Jeff's a little like that.
995340	996620	But I'm generally right.
996620	1000340	Well, I think that's why you I think you make yourself right.
1000340	1003380	Yeah, you pick you'll go like catch up to the worst and I'll tell you why.
1003380	1006700	And then you just you just plant a flag and then you're not going to you're not going
1006700	1008740	to stop until mustard is illegal.
1010020	1012540	And it's like you just you just do it to do it.
1013140	1019940	I do it because I mean, I I pick I think in the past I would pick things like you say
1019940	1021420	and then I would stick to them for no reason.
1021420	1027040	I did do what you said is that like sometimes I would just pick the diametrical diametrically
1027040	1030840	opposed thing just to have that sort of interaction to get that thing going.
1030840	1031840	Whatever that is.
1031840	1033200	I think I definitely agree with that.
1033200	1036720	But like I'll just go like, you know what, like fuck Wolf Blitzer, fuck Led Zeppelin,
1036720	1037720	fuck this, fuck that.
1037720	1039440	Well, the second one's controversial.
1039440	1042000	Who's going to go, wait a minute, fuck Wolf Blitzer?
1044000	1047000	Did you just say something about the news Kenny Rogers?
1047000	1053660	The camera pans over and there's like a Paul Bunyan guy that is just wiping his mouth
1053660	1054660	with a napkin.
1054660	1057660	I can tolerate a lot of things.
1057660	1063420	I've watched my country go from a field of beautiful pine to a bunch of Walmart parking
1063420	1064420	lots.
1064420	1068300	But I won't have anybody selling your Wolf Blitzer's name.
1068300	1069860	You sir can meet me outside.
1069860	1075820	But like, you know, my joke was always that I can convince anybody that they don't actually
1075820	1076820	like Rush.
1077640	1078640	Because they don't.
1078640	1079640	Because you're right.
1079640	1080640	They don't like them.
1080640	1085200	No, you had an older brother who did and you're an idiot and don't say they're technically
1085200	1089680	a good man because Hitler was technically a good chancellor and shit.
1089680	1094000	What Rush did, what I think Rush did and what bothers people that hate them, and I know people
1094000	1097800	like him, they took rock and roll and then they drained all of the sex out.
1097800	1098800	Just all of it.
1098800	1104960	Just pulled all every amount of sex out and then they replaced it with Ayn Rand and sci-fi,
1104960	1108020	which is not a good substitute.
1108020	1109020	Rock and roll was sex.
1109020	1112220	It was Elvis' pelvis and all that shit and I was like, no, we'll take all of the reason
1112220	1113220	this music exists.
1113220	1114220	We'll move that.
1114220	1115220	You're right.
1115220	1119700	There are things about the fountainhead with bass pedals and octagon drums.
1119700	1123100	Because Rush was like 70s, 80s, right?
1123100	1124100	Yeah, yeah.
1124100	1125100	It's 70s, 80s.
1125100	1126100	That's a lot of sexy music.
1126100	1129140	A lot of people were inseminated and conceived during-
1129140	1131220	My tour in the Snow Dogs.
1131220	1134220	Nobody was conceived to a Rush song.
1134220	1137440	Nobody put on red bar cheddar and took his pants off.
1137440	1140440	Nobody's father came during, ah, salesman.
1140440	1143440	I'm a salesman.
1143440	1146440	I'm a salesman.
1146440	1151880	In fact, in fact, my sperm count just got lower.
1151880	1158120	Look, look, though his mind is not for red, to any god or governed meds.
1158120	1163080	It's reserved a quiet defense, lighting out the day's rest.
1164080	1167500	If you choose to not decide, you still have made a choice.
1167500	1168500	No, no, you haven't.
1168500	1169500	You haven't at all.
1169500	1170500	Honey, not tonight.
1170500	1171500	I have a headache again.
1171500	1177260	I think- I have a technically- I have a technical headache.
1177260	1182460	Joe Hill, the author, totally hates Rush and he was tweeting some shit and somebody tweeted
1182460	1185220	something about- he was just so mad that Rush was in the hall.
1185220	1189140	So Joe Hill goes, in honor of Rush getting in the Rockin' Hall of Fame, I will now listen
1189140	1191060	to all my favorite Rush records.
1191080	1194080	And then a minute later he goes, done.
1194080	1199680	I mean, yeah, when I played Dungeons and Dragons in high school, my first Dungeon Master- no,
1199680	1205680	not my first, my best Dungeon Master, Graham, had the jean jackets and he had the- all his
1205680	1211440	t-shirts were from different states that had state parks because he loved nature.
1211440	1215960	He wanted to be an elf or like Spock, like he was one of those personalities.
1215960	1216960	He barefoot a lot.
1216960	1223020	He prided himself on his pit stains and went to high school with a woman's briefcase and
1223020	1225220	because he was like, I give zero fucks.
1225220	1229580	Like I guess he didn't give a fuck because he was like, he's like Spock, but like badass.
1229580	1231420	He gave and received zero fucks.
1231420	1236540	Yeah, it's like, fuck you, I'm smarter than you, like you know how you want like the Columbine
1236540	1240220	kid to- you want to reach back in time and go, it doesn't matter.
1240220	1244060	Like Graham was one of the kids that- he knew it didn't matter and that's the personality
1244060	1245060	you get.
1245160	1247960	He saw the illusion the minute they presented it to him.
1247960	1251080	But he loved Rush, yeah.
1251080	1256000	He loved Denim and Rush and yeah, they were like, you know, he'd sign your yearbook with
1256000	1258960	Rush lyrics and I didn't- I didn't hate him.
1258960	1265220	He made me- because he loved him so much, I would be like, I would be one of those diametrical
1265220	1267960	guys and go like, this is the worst.
1267960	1268960	Pink Floyd's way better.
1268960	1269960	Like, right.
1269960	1270960	Is it 15?
1270960	1271960	Is it yes?
1271960	1272960	Is it yes?
1272960	1273960	The band that has like a-
1274860	1275860	Yeah, that would be nice.
1276860	1280860	They may absolutely fuck off into the night forever.
1280860	1281860	Oh, Jeff.
1281860	1282860	Christopher Squire!
1282860	1286860	I'm sorry, I have a special guest, you know, I hate to- we're talking about music, but
1286860	1287860	you know, I really-
1287860	1289860	There's Neil Peart right behind me right now.
1289860	1290860	Yeah.
1290860	1291860	You're gonna have to deal with the professor.
1291860	1297500	One of my favorite musicians of the world from the Michael Jackson Thriller song is
1297500	1298500	Vincent Price.
1298500	1301500	Did you- I don't know if you knew that like-
1301500	1302500	Is he here tonight?
1302520	1306520	Yeah, a lot of people think he's dead, but Vincent Price is actually here.
1306520	1311520	Is it Vincent Price the actor or Vincent Price from Thriller?
1311520	1315520	It's Vincent Price- oh, it's Vincent Price the actor.
1315520	1318520	I don't know if he wants to do the Thriller bridge.
1318520	1319520	Should I do a beat?
1319520	1323520	Maybe you could rap a bit and he could do like the Vincent Price breakdown in the middle
1323520	1324520	of it?
1324520	1325520	I mean, we could-
1325520	1328520	It's been so very long.
1328520	1329520	It's Vincent Price.
1329520	1331520	It's James Adomian, everybody.
1331540	1336540	That's one of my favorite impressions that he does is this Vincent Price.
1336540	1339540	He did it in a Yacht Rock episode.
1339540	1340540	Yo.
1340540	1341540	Yo.
1341540	1342540	Yo.
1342540	1343540	Yo.
1343540	1344540	Yo.
1344540	1346540	I'm rapping bout, rapping with my friend Vincent Price.
1346540	1349540	Gonna do the rap and he's gonna do the bridge.
1349540	1350540	Nice.
1350540	1352540	First I'm gonna talk about my favorite cereal.
1352540	1353540	Yo.
1353540	1356540	I like to pour it into a bowl and eat it down.
1356540	1358540	Drain the milk.
1358540	1359540	Slowly.
1361520	1370540	He just made cereal spooky.
1370540	1375540	I don't know what else to do there.
1375540	1378540	Mount a chocula brand cereal.
1378540	1381540	Yeah, just- alright.
1381540	1383540	Well anyways, I don't know.
1383540	1385540	I don't want to pimp you to do impressions and stuff but-
1385540	1386540	Oh, I love that one.
1386540	1389540	I love when he- when I- when I was a kid he used to do advertisements.
1389540	1390540	Like, you would-
1390540	1392540	Cousin subs, for instance?
1392540	1393540	I don't know that one.
1393540	1394540	What does it- how does it go?
1394540	1396540	Well, I was a- I was a local sub place hat.
1396540	1398540	You had Vincent Price on the- on the payroll and he would go,
1398540	1405540	Hello, sorry to interrupt your meal but- but you could be having a spooky sandwich from me.
1405540	1414540	I was just about- I was- and he would pull a cord and a cheap ass Photoshop pendulum would cut the sandwich in half.
1414540	1416540	That's how I cut my sandwiches.
1416540	1418540	The ham has been murdered.
1418540	1421540	Was that voice ever actually considered scary by society?
1421540	1423540	Like, did it- why that voice?
1423540	1426540	It deets back to really asshole landlords from the 1800s.
1426540	1431540	That's why they're afraid they can cut off their gas oil at any moment so that voice is terrifying.
1431540	1433540	People really used to believe in vampires.
1433540	1437540	I think it's that you didn't have to be, like, ripped in order to be scary.
1437540	1442540	Like, we transitioned into a society where, like, we had enough security camera footage
1442540	1451540	to realize that the really scary thing is physical fitness and, you know, soci- being an sociopathic.
1451540	1455540	Sociopathology, not people who are, hmm, I'm a gentleman.
1455540	1457540	I like the smell of your blood.
1457540	1460540	It's like, like, that guy you can take down with.
1460540	1464540	Aesthetic reasons are the reasons I persecute you.
1464540	1467540	I was like, there used to be a fear of people like Bela Lugosi.
1467540	1470540	Like, that guy's not scary, really, through a modern lens.
1470540	1474540	Yeah, look at that weakling. He's out to get us.
1474540	1478540	Not after you see enough, like, Chinese babies getting run over in parking lots.
1478540	1482540	Like, I got 4chan. Hey, I didn't put them there.
1482540	1487540	Jesus, why do I always bare the brunt for these videos I mentioned?
1487540	1490540	Wait, tell me more about the Chinese baby parking lot.
1490540	1494540	Dude, if you know what to look for, and I do,
1494540	1496540	no, there's horrible things that happen.
1496540	1500540	If I type those keywords in, I'm looking at a video of babies being run over in a parking lot.
1500540	1505540	There are so many cameras now, and there's been that way for so long,
1505540	1509540	and the population is so high now, and there are so many countries where-
1509540	1513540	China has different rules, by the way, I guess.
1513540	1518540	Oh, you're saying there's surveillance footage of a baby accidentally being run over.
1518540	1520540	There's not a parking lot full of babies.
1520540	1522540	People, as a blood sport, like-
1522540	1524540	That might be a thing. I don't know.
1524540	1527540	The one child policy wasn't working.
1527540	1530540	There's just horrible shit you can see.
1530540	1534540	Like, in countries that are overpopulated and that don't have good Samaritan laws,
1534540	1538540	you know, where there's just like, oh, this guy was eating someone on a subway.
1538540	1543540	Look at this. It's just- Anyways.
1543540	1547540	Eating on a subway? Where?
1547540	1550540	What would Vincent Price have to say about a Chinese baby getting run over?
1551540	1552540	Oh, God.
1552540	1554540	Nothing appropriate?
1559540	1562540	My one son.
1564540	1567540	My one precious son.
1567540	1570540	Come on to the carbuncle.
1572540	1576540	Come on to the carbuncle. That was a big post-story, I think, wasn't it?
1576540	1578540	Come on to the carbuncle. Wasn't that egg round-
1578540	1581540	All right, let's make it easier. Wait, keep the music going, Jeff.
1581540	1586540	Hey, Vincent Price, maybe we should go- Vincent Price, I know you're my roommate.
1587540	1593540	I was hoping that we could pay the bill to the Department of Water and Power.
1596540	1599540	My car doesn't work. Could we go to the grocery store together?
1599540	1601540	I'm sorry.
1604540	1608540	We need to get some Sudofan and some maple syrup.
1608540	1611540	Do you mean some pseudoephedrine for your ills?
1611540	1612540	Oh, my God.
1612540	1615540	I have quite the elixir, roommate of all mine.
1615540	1619540	Oh, my God. It's making me drowsy. I don't know. Okay.
1620540	1625540	I hope that's the first episode of a long series of Vincent Price and my roommates.
1630540	1633540	Can you do Marin on cue, or is that-
1633540	1634540	Oh, yeah.
1634540	1636540	Let me do an interview with Mark Marin real quick.
1636540	1638540	Yeah, what do you want? Yes.
1639540	1641540	Oh, come on. What, really?
1642540	1644540	Thanks for having me on your show, Mark Marin.
1644540	1648540	Oh, yeah, it's my show because I was being interviewed. Yeah, fine.
1648540	1651540	So you did the show. What was that like?
1653540	1654540	That's awesome.
1654540	1657540	Yeah, you got to say Marin in Space is fucking amazing.
1658540	1660540	It's really, really, really funny.
1661540	1664540	They're web shorts. You spend the whole time laughing.
1664540	1666540	I was talking to you about this.
1666540	1672540	This will sound pretentious to non-LA people who don't make stuff for a living and all this stuff.
1672540	1675540	It's like we're up here jerking each other off, but let's jerk each other off for a second.
1676540	1680540	Your impressions, I think-
1681540	1684540	Sometimes people feel about impressions the way they feel about magic.
1684540	1688540	It's like, well, what are you doing? You're sounding like somebody, but I think there's a-
1688540	1693540	You do them in a strange, tender way, like you write up to your-
1693540	1695540	When you're doing Mark Marin-
1695540	1697540	Massage the muscles of the person you're impersonating.
1697540	1700540	You're not sitting there watching Mark Marin and going,
1700540	1702540	Oh, fuck him. Here's how he talks.
1704540	1706540	You create a character for him.
1706540	1708540	That was Rich Little's process.
1709540	1713540	I feel sometimes when I'm listening to an impression being done, I feel like,
1713540	1717540	Okay, congratulations, you figured out that Nick Nolte has an overbite.
1718540	1722540	But I feel like your characters are a little more loving.
1722540	1725540	Yeah, well, sometimes I hate them.
1725540	1727540	Like George W. Bush, I was trying to ruin him.
1728540	1732540	Yeah, usually it's something I'm fascinated by for good reasons,
1732540	1735540	and then it's just fun to sort of imagine being that person.
1736540	1739540	When you're in your head, you got a little simulator running,
1739540	1742540	like you are the person, right? A little bit, because you have to know what they might say.
1742540	1745540	Yeah, yeah. That's what helps with somebody like Jesse Ventura,
1745540	1750540	because he lives in so many worlds, is that no matter what happens,
1750540	1753540	there's either a conspiracy or an old match that scarred him.
1755540	1758540	So if Jesse Ventura were my roommate and I needed him to-
1758540	1760540	Such a real crowded apartment.
1761540	1766540	I know, but we toured it together when we decided to sign the lease,
1766540	1768540	and you haven't paid the- you're part of the electric bill yet.
1768540	1773540	You mean to the Department of Water and Power? I want to know how high it goes.
1775540	1780540	It just goes to the office, you just write, your half is 1750, my half is 1750,
1780540	1783540	and then we don't- Why are there only two parties?
1783540	1789540	This is two halves of the check, man.
1789540	1791540	Did you go to work this week?
1791540	1795540	Yup, I was commenting on some underground DVD titles.
1798540	1801540	You seem defensive when you say that. How much does that pull down a year?
1801540	1804540	I work, I was surfing, you don't need to know my business.
1806540	1810540	Alright, Jesse Ventura. He's an Impressionist.
1813540	1816540	I don't get to like a lot of Impressionists, it's fun for me.
1816540	1818540	There's a rarefied number that-
1818540	1821540	It's refreshing. I'm putting out the magician challenge.
1821540	1825540	If you're a magician and you think that Jeff and I can like you, come to Harmon Town.
1826540	1829540	Do a little magic. It'll be great for the listening.
1830540	1835540	When you think of Impressionists, I have a couple of friends that can do impressions of almost anybody,
1835540	1837540	and it's great, but the reason why it's fun is because they're funny.
1837540	1841540	The things they say are actually like you're being funny while saying them.
1841540	1844540	Rich Little, for my money, isn't a very funny guy.
1847540	1850540	He's taking on Wolf Blitzer and Rich Little.
1850540	1853540	Jeff Davis bashes Rich Little.
1853540	1855540	Take that. Who's next?
1855540	1859540	I believe this. I believe I know some more who would disagree with you on that.
1860540	1863540	Frank Gorshin, remember him? He was actually funny.
1863540	1867540	When he did Burt Lancaster, it was a fucking riot because he said funny things.
1868540	1872540	That's the difference. I can do like two impressions and they're shitty.
1872540	1875540	What would piss me off is I would go on the road as a comic with these guys
1875540	1878540	who would do impressions of people who were already funny.
1878540	1882540	They were comedians like Rodney Dangerfield, and then they would just do Rodney bits.
1882540	1885540	But worse than that, I do that sometimes.
1887540	1889540	No, I make up a new one.
1889540	1891540	No, you make up a new one. These guys were doing actual Rodney bits.
1891540	1894540	James, how much respect do you think that you get?
1897540	1900540	You know, I get a little bit of respect there.
1900540	1903540	That's the worst Rodney Dangerfield I've ever heard in my life.
1903540	1905540	You said James!
1906540	1909540	You have to do it like Lipton. Is Rodney there?
1909540	1910540	Yeah.
1911540	1914540	I'm always waiting for the James Lipton moment.
1914540	1917540	Is Rodney inside you right now?
1918540	1922540	I can do some impressions.
1922540	1926540	You thought you had Liam Neeson and we found out that you lost him.
1926540	1928540	I thought I had him for a while.
1928540	1930540	Can we try some Liam?
1931540	1934540	Ask me a question about wolves.
1937540	1939540	The wolves, are they nearby?
1939540	1942540	It doesn't matter if they're nearby.
1942540	1944540	They'll bite you.
1946540	1947540	Did Liam Neeson?
1947540	1949540	You know what, I walked into that.
1949540	1951540	It's intimidating looking at him and doing it.
1951540	1953540	Was Liam Neeson eating a sandwich during that one?
1954540	1957540	There's no sandwich, it's just wolf bites.
1959540	1962540	I'm sorry, I pimped you for that.
1962540	1964540	Who can you most confidently do?
1964540	1965540	Who's your best impression?
1965540	1970540	No, I don't think I have someone that I'm like, oh, slam dunk.
1970540	1971540	You don't?
1971540	1972540	Yeah.
1972540	1974540	You usually do a pretty good Rosie Perez.
1975540	1980540	Maybe Mr. T. I think I could pity the fool and put something on my head.
1980540	1983540	But that's more of a prop work kind of thing.
1984540	1986540	We want to do a Jesse Ventura?
1986540	1992540	You know, I just turned her voice over like you've been shouting all day.
1996540	1999540	You listen to me, Rowdy Rowdy Piper.
1999540	2001540	That's pretty good.
2001540	2003540	It's like a different wrestler.
2003540	2010540	Now, Dan, do the gray, but instead of Liam Neeson, put Jesse Ventura in there as the star of the gray.
2010540	2016540	It doesn't matter how far along we are, if they have coats, we're already dead.
2017540	2019540	I sound like Nick Nolte.
2020540	2021540	Rich.
2022540	2024540	This is Gary Busey.
2026540	2028540	This is also Gary Busey.
2029540	2032540	This is either Popeye or Marlon Brando.
2034540	2035540	Or neither.
2038540	2040540	Don't take that off the table.
2041540	2043540	It could be neither.
2043540	2044540	Don't remove that option.
2044540	2045540	We're going to use it.
2045540	2052540	Or Johnny Carson doing a scene from Streetcar Named Desire.
2053540	2056540	Have you heard about the Napoleonic Clause?
2057540	2060540	Johnny Carson was a nerd back in the old days.
2060540	2061540	We would play a game.
2061540	2064540	You'd get high, and then you would do what we called plausible Carson episode.
2064540	2072540	And what it was was you had to introduce three people for a Carson, but it had to be people who would conceivably be on the same show during the actual run of the Tonight Show.
2072540	2074540	So you'd be like, we have a great show tonight.
2074540	2077540	We have Martin Mole from the hit movie Mr. Mom is here.
2077540	2079540	Beautiful young singer Dionne Warwick is here tonight.
2079540	2082540	And from Lenny and Squeaky, Michael McKean.
2082540	2085540	It would have to be people that actually could have shared a Carson bill.
2085540	2086540	And it gets it.
2086540	2088540	And the game is over when the third name is said.
2088540	2091540	Yeah, when no one can do it anymore.
2091540	2094540	And when you're not high enough to still think it's funny.
2094540	2097540	That's when the game runs out.
2097540	2099540	I would play that by mail with you.
2103540	2105540	Does anyone play things by mail anymore?
2105540	2106540	I do.
2106540	2108540	You don't really play by mail games?
2108540	2110540	I play a game by mail with Matt Gurley from Super Ego.
2110540	2112540	Super Ego is one of my favorite podcasts.
2112540	2116540	My friend Matt, who I've been best friends with from like seventh grade on.
2116540	2119540	We play a game called Death that we started doing in...
2119540	2122540	I think we're all playing that one.
2122540	2124540	Especially the people that are mailing things to each other.
2124540	2126540	They're the ones that are winning.
2126540	2130540	I have a real kicker of a chess move.
2130540	2133540	Make this stamp go down to the post office.
2133540	2136540	We even broke four in the envelope.
2136540	2137540	So excited.
2137540	2139540	Two months later, we'll see if it works.
2139540	2141540	We started in school.
2141540	2143540	One of us would just draw like a guy.
2143540	2144540	Like in the middle of a piece of paper.
2144540	2146540	We just draw a neutral guy standing there.
2146540	2148540	And then you would draw him dying somehow.
2148540	2150540	And then you would give it to the other person.
2150540	2152540	We'd slip it like a note in class.
2152540	2155540	And originally it was just like back and forth in school.
2155540	2157540	And by the end, this page, we have these from school.
2157540	2159540	But there's just 30 million.
2159540	2160540	They get more and more obscure.
2160540	2161540	You can't repeat it.
2161540	2162540	So then they would get really weird.
2162540	2165540	So now if Matt mails me one, they'll be a guy.
2165540	2167540	And they'll just be a fruit cart way in the background.
2167540	2170540	That has a sign that says oranges,
2170540	2172540	which is a Godfather reference.
2172540	2174540	Because every time you see an orange in the Godfather,
2174540	2175540	somebody dies.
2175540	2177540	Oh, so the fruit cart doesn't have to kill him.
2177540	2180540	He's going to get whacked because there's oranges
2180540	2181540	in the background.
2181540	2183540	It's not a fruit cart accident, per se.
2183540	2185540	But when's the last time you did that?
2185540	2186540	You're not doing that actively.
2186540	2187540	It is active.
2187540	2189540	Whose move is it right now?
2189540	2190540	It's Matt's.
2190540	2191540	It's on his refrigerator.
2191540	2193540	And he's fucking taking a long, sweet time about it.
2193540	2194540	What a fucker.
2194540	2195540	I know.
2195540	2196540	Fuck that guy.
2196540	2197540	All right.
2197540	2199540	Well, John Roy and James Adomian, anything.
2199540	2202540	You should listen to Don't Ever Change.
2202540	2204540	And James, do you have anything going on we can?
2204540	2205540	Nope.
2205540	2206540	Nope.
2206540	2211540	I'm just sort of winding down my whole career.
2211540	2212540	More podcasts.
2212540	2213540	Just hear me on more podcasts.
2213540	2215540	Oh, and Maron in Space is on ISC.com.
2215540	2216540	Yes.
2216540	2217540	Yeah, yeah.
2217540	2218540	Go check it out.
2218540	2219540	It really is funny.
2219540	2230540	James and John, thanks for coming by.
2230540	2231540	All right.
2231540	2232540	Look.
2232540	2234540	We've wasted too much time, Jeff.
2234540	2237540	We got an old friend back that people are very excited is back.
2237540	2238540	I'm sure.
2238540	2242540	They must be excited is back.
2242540	2246540	I'm sure people love hearing from me about what's going on in my life.
2246540	2247540	Yeah.
2247540	2250540	I really, I swear to God, I got nothing because I'm so excited that Kumail Nanjiani is back.
2250540	2255540	Let's bring him up.
2255540	2258540	Hello.
2258540	2268540	That sounds like what my heart's doing right now.
2268540	2273300	I think that's why I picked that song today because I feel like sunshine and lollipops
2273300	2274300	and moonbeams.
2275300	2276300	I miss doing this show so much.
2276300	2280300	We never really, we never officially said you were part of the family.
2280300	2283300	It was that's that's probably why you're part of it because you're very low maintenance
2283300	2284300	guy.
2284300	2285300	You just came, you know, and it was fun.
2285300	2288300	So you came back and we just, you know, that's how I like to do my business.
2288300	2292300	By the way, I just like there was a giant power vacuum that took place to fill up your
2292300	2293300	role in the D&D.
2293300	2294300	What happened?
2294300	2295300	I'm kidding.
2295300	2296300	We had Tyler who did a fucking awesome job.
2296300	2297300	Everybody.
2297300	2300300	Hello, Tyler.
2301300	2302300	Yeah.
2302300	2303300	I was, I was working.
2303300	2304300	I was.
2304300	2305300	This is the show.
2305300	2308300	The show is leaking.
2308300	2310300	Hissing in the back.
2310300	2314300	There's like a person deflating slowly.
2314300	2320300	Spencer was a balloon the entire time.
2320300	2322300	That's even more impressive.
2322300	2324300	You didn't think a human was that unflappable?
2324300	2325300	Yeah, exactly.
2325300	2329300	He took everything in stride because he was filled with helium.
2329300	2330300	Yeah, I was.
2330300	2332300	And then I was in Europe for a couple of weeks.
2332300	2334300	Was that just for fun because I was just for fun.
2334300	2339300	I went to your Instagram photos of Paris and Rome and Florence were outstanding.
2339300	2345300	My wife and I hadn't like taken a vacation in like years and it was sort of getting to
2345300	2350300	me like I was my temper was getting short and I just really, really needed to go.
2350300	2351300	I'd never been there.
2351300	2352300	And it was amazing.
2352300	2355300	You gave me a lot of like great tips.
2355300	2359300	Camille emailed me and said, hey, I'm going to be in Paris like tomorrow.
2359300	2360300	You seem well traveled.
2360300	2361300	Can you give me some tips?
2361300	2364300	I don't have any Paris tips, but I will forward this to Greg Proops.
2364300	2370300	Greg Proops sent you an email like really long and it's like it should be published.
2370300	2371300	It's a poll.
2371300	2373300	It's like it really should go online.
2373300	2375300	Maybe I'll put it on the forum with Greg's approval.
2375300	2376300	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2376300	2380300	It makes you want to pick up everything you can right now if you could and just go to
2380300	2382300	Paris and check off everything off.
2382300	2387300	Go to Notre Dame at night and have a cup of coffee at this place and then walk over here
2387300	2391300	and then some night just stay in, get bread and fruit and watch French TV.
2391300	2392300	It's awesome.
2392300	2393300	There we go.
2393300	2398300	It was a poem and there was no it was all lowercase, no punctuation, just like beauty,
2398300	2399300	beauty, beauty.
2399300	2400300	It was wonderful.
2400300	2401300	It's a great well-rounded history.
2401300	2402300	There's there's secret stuff.
2402300	2405300	There's very like check this out because you have to see this.
2405300	2407300	But it was like it made me want to go do it.
2407300	2408300	It was wonderful.
2408300	2409300	Yeah.
2409300	2410300	And then you asked me like what about Florence?
2410300	2412300	The sandwich place I like.
2412300	2414300	Hey, it was a great sandwich place.
2414300	2417300	I almost cried from the sandwich.
2417300	2418300	This is a weird story.
2418300	2422300	So we were in Paris and so we'd miss Breaking Bad and it was Monday morning.
2422300	2424300	We were bummed out because we were out of the country.
2424300	2425300	This is true.
2425300	2430300	So we're at the Louvre, the fucking Louvre where the Mona Lisa is and we're sort of talking
2430300	2431300	about Breaking Bad.
2431300	2432300	We've been there for hours.
2432300	2438300	We're sitting and I look over and I'm like, is that Vince Gilligan, the creator of Breaking
2438300	2439300	Bad?
2439300	2440300	So Emily's like, no.
2440300	2442300	I'm like, Google what he looks like.
2442300	2444300	And while she's googling it, I go over.
2444300	2445300	I'm so sure.
2445300	2446300	I'm like, hey, are you American?
2446300	2447300	He's like, yes.
2447300	2450300	I was like, are you Vince Gilligan?
2450300	2453300	And he's like, fuck.
2453300	2460300	Let me guess, you love Breaking Bad.
2460300	2462300	What a shocker.
2462300	2464300	I came to the Louvre.
2464300	2465300	Yeah.
2465300	2468300	So I could be second best at something.
2469300	2470300	Exactly.
2470300	2472300	Trying to escape my genius.
2472300	2473300	Yeah.
2473300	2478300	I wanted to get away from the Mona Lisa of TV shows to see the Mona Lisa of paintings.
2478300	2483300	The Mona Lisa stops looking straight out, looks at him, goes like, I love this.
2483300	2484300	Oh, God.
2484300	2486300	Big X-Files man too.
2486300	2488300	You look over and you see Mona Lisa has her iPhone out.
2488300	2491300	She likes that too.
2491300	2495300	I never do this, but I got a picture with him because I had my hands were shaking while
2495300	2496300	I was talking to him.
2496300	2497300	It was awesome.
2497300	2498300	He was like a great guy.
2498300	2500300	He's nothing like I would have pictured him.
2500300	2501300	No.
2501300	2502300	I got to meet him at a function.
2502300	2507300	I was invited to this TV guide show runner's dinner or something.
2507300	2511300	It was the only place where I'd ever get to meet him because he was technically the other
2511300	2512300	side.
2512300	2515300	And I just was just fanned out and took a picture with him.
2515300	2520300	I don't have a story like that, but let's talk about his personality now that we both
2520300	2521300	met him.
2521300	2525300	He seems like he's such a laid back nice guy who if you give him a compliment, he always
2525300	2526300	deflects it.
2526300	2527300	He's like, Oh, that wasn't me.
2527300	2528300	That was this person.
2528300	2529300	That was this person.
2529300	2532300	He like gives his whole team the credit for everything.
2532300	2533300	Yeah.
2533300	2535300	And that show is, you know what's interesting?
2535300	2536300	I'm a big.
2536300	2537300	Because he's an old pro.
2537300	2539300	I mean, he came up through the trenches and like was like.
2539300	2541300	He was a big X-Files guy.
2541300	2542300	Yeah.
2542300	2543300	Knocking it out of the park on the X-Files.
2543300	2544300	Yeah.
2544300	2545300	Knocking out of the park.
2545300	2549300	And he patiently waited for his turn at bat and is pioneering the golden age of TV.
2549300	2550300	Yeah.
2550300	2554300	And I just, I still, I still always anticipate what, so when you really admire, well, when
2555300	2560300	you really admire somebody, I always still picture a giant fat mountain of a person with
2560300	2563300	a huge beard with squirrels in it.
2563300	2568300	I know it always blows my mind when these people are like clean cut and articulate and
2568300	2571300	kind of very polite and well-spoken.
2571300	2572300	He was great.
2572300	2573300	And.
2573300	2575300	Someone say a big beard.
2575300	2578300	Whoa.
2578300	2580300	Okay.
2580300	2583300	I feel like I've missed something.
2584300	2586300	Camille, you haven't.
2586300	2588300	This is what happened in the three weeks I was gone.
2588300	2589300	No, no.
2589300	2594300	For the home listener, BJ walked up to almost no fanfare.
2594300	2599300	What I also love is that he's got a full thing of frozen yogurt that's still frozen.
2599300	2600300	So he just got here.
2600300	2605300	He's dressed somewhere between Jesus and Mrs. Roper from, from Freeze Company.
2605300	2609300	He's holding some ice cream from Baskin and Robbins.
2609300	2610300	No, it's Pinkberry.
2610300	2612300	And he just walked in.
2612300	2616300	You're late to the show, but have the gall to come right on stage.
2616300	2617300	He's, he's BJ.
2617300	2618300	It's amazing.
2618300	2620300	He really doesn't care.
2620300	2622300	BJ, BJ is a, is a.
2622300	2626300	I feel like you're just glossing over the possibility of time travel.
2626300	2629300	Oh, well, I don't know.
2629300	2632300	I mean, he, yeah, I don't know if he glossed over it.
2632300	2634300	That was the quietest I've ever been.
2634300	2639300	To know you, to know BJ is to, is to have to admit the possibility of time travel.
2639300	2642300	But I mean, then his timing would be improved.
2642300	2648300	If you, if you had the power of time travel, you wouldn't think, you know, the awkwardness
2648300	2649300	would be, would be short off.
2649300	2651300	I saw you at Comic Con.
2651300	2652300	I saw you on the sidewalk.
2652300	2656300	I was going to say how are you sure it was him, but.
2656300	2660300	BJ, where does one pick up a smart tunic like that?
2660300	2662300	How would you describe what you're wearing right now?
2662300	2667300	It's, it's apostolic.
2668300	2669300	Here.
2669300	2670300	BJ, come over here.
2670300	2673300	If you're going to, if you're going to be up here, grab a mic like a person.
2673300	2674300	There you go.
2674300	2675300	I apologize.
2675300	2676300	And please in bare feet.
2676300	2678300	Like, like, like, like Levi.
2678300	2679300	Like what?
2679300	2685300	We had a, we had a guy on here that would give you a run for your money.
2685300	2687300	Maybe not sartorily.
2687300	2690300	The look on Camille's face right now is like, what the fuck?
2690300	2692300	I go away for two weeks.
2692300	2693300	Yeah.
2693300	2696300	Well, I'm thinking of all the decisions I've made in my life that have led to this exactly.
2696300	2699300	Do this exact thing happen.
2699300	2700300	And I'm happy.
2700300	2701300	I mean, no regrets.
2701300	2705300	Is anybody getting a good Instagram to post this on the line for those who will be curious
2705300	2706300	later on?
2706300	2707300	What's your.
2707300	2708300	Okay.
2708300	2712300	Someone tell me how to get an Instagram account started.
2712300	2718300	BJ is a, you have a, do you have a PhD in theology or just a masters?
2718300	2719300	I have a PDF.
2719300	2720300	PDF.
2720300	2721300	All right.
2721300	2722300	All right.
2722300	2723300	We're okay.
2723300	2724300	BJ.
2724300	2725300	I don't know if we talk about this before.
2725300	2726300	What was it?
2726300	2727300	What was the reality?
2727300	2728300	The reality show that you won?
2728300	2729300	What was it?
2729300	2730300	Wait, what?
2730300	2731300	The great race.
2731300	2732300	I feel like it's an amazing race.
2732300	2733300	The amazing race.
2733300	2734300	I'll just say it because he won't give a straight answer.
2734300	2735300	He won a million dollars.
2735300	2736300	He won the million dollar prize.
2736300	2737300	This is what happens when you win a reality show.
2737300	2738300	I'm sorry.
2738300	2739300	I'm sorry.
2739300	2740300	I'm sorry.
2740300	2741300	I'm sorry.
2741300	2742300	I'm sorry.
2742300	2743300	I'm sorry.
2743300	2744300	I'm sorry.
2744300	2745300	I'm sorry.
2745300	2746300	I'm sorry.
2746300	2747300	I'm sorry.
2747300	2751500	What happens when you win a reality show?
2751500	2752500	You won.
2752500	2753500	Okay.
2753500	2754500	You won the amazing race.
2754500	2755500	You did?
2755500	2756500	Allegedly.
2756500	2757500	No, he did.
2757500	2758500	He did.
2758500	2759500	He won an amazing race.
2759500	2760880	I mean, they had a few of them.
2760880	2762380	Some were amazing than others.
2762380	2765140	Did you win a million dollars?
2765140	2766140	Well.
2766140	2768220	Just say yes or no.
2768220	2770380	Did you?
2770380	2772380	Taxes and the economy and everything.
2772380	2776980	The Obama and, you know, everything that's happening in the news and football and everything.
2777980	2779980	So, you know, embedding and everyone's like, go.
2779980	2782980	BJ, do you think that million dollars changed you at all?
2788980	2789980	And please say yes.
2789980	2794980	What I want to do is I want to call the showrunners of Amazing Race and be like, this is what you did.
2795980	2798980	No, I didn't do the show.
2798980	2800980	You were always this BJ, probably.
2800980	2802980	You were this BJ on Amazing Race.
2802980	2804980	No, I was much less BJ in the past.
2804980	2805980	Really?
2805980	2806980	I'm not using that phrase.
2806980	2809980	You were rounding off the edges a little bit back in the old days?
2809980	2812980	Aaron knew him in the Clark Kent days.
2812980	2813980	Oh, yeah.
2813980	2815980	Before I got my super powers?
2815980	2816980	Right, yeah.
2816980	2818980	Or at least before you got that hat.
2818980	2819980	Before I got Lasik.
2819980	2821980	That hat is his own kind of superpower.
2821980	2824980	Well, he's actually not the hat I would prefer to be wearing right now.
2824980	2825980	Really?
2825980	2828980	That's your second favorite hat?
2830980	2832980	That's plan B.
2833980	2835980	So are you really, do you really have a PhD in theology?
2835980	2836980	You didn't answer it.
2836980	2837980	You did a whole...
2837980	2840980	I'm very good at dodging questions.
2840980	2841980	Yeah.
2841980	2842980	I'm Kamel.
2842980	2843980	Nice to meet you, man.
2843980	2845980	Or do you have a PhD in theology?
2845980	2850980	It is a theology degree of some kind.
2853980	2854980	I don't have it on me.
2854980	2855980	I don't have any pockets.
2857980	2859980	How did you get that pinkberry?
2859980	2861980	Did you just say, if you give it to me, I'll leave?
2862980	2868980	I'm going to get picked apart on Reddit for that comment.
2868980	2872980	What flavor of pinkberry did you go with, BJ?
2872980	2873980	Well...
2873980	2874980	People want to know.
2874980	2875980	Yeah, how do...
2875980	2876980	When they were like, what flavor do you want?
2876980	2877980	Where do you go?
2877980	2879980	Oh, the football and the economy.
2879980	2880980	I don't know.
2880980	2881980	I don't know.
2881980	2882980	I don't know.
2882980	2883980	I don't know.
2883980	2884980	I don't know.
2884980	2885980	I don't know.
2885980	2886980	I don't know.
2886980	2887980	I don't know.
2887980	2888980	I don't know.
2888980	2889980	I don't know.
2889980	2890980	I don't know.
2891980	2894980	Isn't that vanilla?
2894980	2896980	Well...
2897980	2903980	BJ, BJ, if you're going to be that specific in your clothing and your attire, it's funny
2903980	2906980	how soft-spoken and ambiguous you are in your replies.
2906980	2909980	You guys are talking to a million-dollar theology student.
2909980	2914980	I guarantee you he doesn't have a lot of that left, right?
2914980	2916980	That money goes quickly, right?
2916980	2918980	It's hard to keep it...
2918980	2925980	I could see your wheels turning, do not answer the question, but say something.
2925980	2927980	How much of the money do you have?
2927980	2928980	Are we falling in love?
2928980	2930980	Is that what they say?
2930980	2932980	I feel like you're misreading the signals.
2932980	2933980	You're like leaning in.
2933980	2936980	This magic moment.
2938980	2939980	Uh...
2939980	2940980	Jesus.
2940980	2941980	I was...
2941980	2942980	Beat...
2942980	2943980	Sorry, I walk into pain.
2943980	2944980	Go ahead, go ahead, sorry.
2944980	2945980	Yeah.
2945980	2946980	Oh, you've got a story.
2946980	2947980	Go ahead.
2947980	2950980	Guys, if you want to hear the story, you all have to stop interrupting me.
2950980	2951980	All right, here we go.
2951980	2952980	Just kidding.
2952980	2955980	I walk into Pinkberry.
2956980	2958980	I think I know what I'm going to get.
2958980	2959980	Okay.
2959980	2966980	I walk up and Chanel says to me, take a look to the right.
2966980	2969980	There's all our choices.
2969980	2974980	So many more choices than I thought there would be.
2974980	2977980	Apparently, I was at the flagship of Pinkberry.
2977980	2981980	I'm glad Jim Crotty isn't alive to see this.
2983980	2989980	So then, so you got confused about the choices.
2989980	2992980	So I said to Chanel...
2992980	2998980	In my mind, we just cut to a second unit shot of you two at a convertible on a country road.
2998980	3000980	And you guys are going to go find out why...
3001980	3004980	They accidentally win another million dollars.
3004980	3006980	It's no accident.
3006980	3011980	I mean, that's a hat on a hat playing music while BJ's on stage.
3011980	3013980	It's a hat on a hat on a hat.
3013980	3019980	I used to live in the neighborhood with a man with two hats, and I thought, that guy is crazy.
3019980	3021980	And that is an indictment.
3021980	3022980	Yeah.
3022980	3027980	In the land of BJ's, the man with two hats is King.
3028980	3029980	I might as well bring Erin up.
3029980	3031980	She's usually the BJ handler.
3031980	3034980	She's the BJ whisperer, I should say.
3034980	3035980	She's out here somewhere.
3035980	3037980	She can make me talk.
3039980	3041980	Here, sweetie.
3041980	3043980	You can stay, Kumail.
3043980	3045980	I'll stand here.
3045980	3047980	Can we get another one?
3047980	3049980	You can share a chair.
3049980	3051980	Here, I'll grab Spencer's. You grab mine.
3051980	3053980	Have a seat, Erin.
3053980	3055980	I can stand up.
3055980	3058980	BJ, you're dripping pinkberry all over our stage.
3058980	3059980	Oh, my goodness.
3059980	3062980	I have to get a paper towel or something.
3062980	3066980	This happens literally every time I walk into any place.
3067980	3069980	Erin, talk to BJ.
3069980	3070980	Hey, BJ.
3070980	3071980	Hey, Erin.
3071980	3073980	How's it going?
3073980	3074980	Pretty okay, I guess.
3074980	3075980	All right.
3075980	3077980	BJ and I used to do an improv show together.
3077980	3078980	Really?
3078980	3081980	Can we see a little bit of that improv?
3081980	3084980	Can I see a little...
3084980	3086980	BJ, you guys have actually known each other for a while.
3086980	3088980	BJ's my friend.
3088980	3089980	I'd like to see a little bit...
3089980	3090980	He's everybody's friend.
3090980	3094980	Try to approximate the improv that you guys used to do together.
3094980	3096980	Oh, hi.
3096980	3098980	Okay, don't you want a situation?
3098980	3101980	I guess this is enough of a situation.
3101980	3103980	Okay, hey.
3103980	3105980	Hey, are you okay?
3108980	3111980	Pretty okay, I guess.
3111980	3112980	Are you okay?
3113980	3115980	I'm all right.
3115980	3116980	Seen.
3119980	3120980	Thank you.
3120980	3122980	Should we do notes now or after the show?
3122980	3125980	Erin, what was he like when you guys were doing...
3125980	3131980	It was very similar to the gentleman before us?
3131980	3134980	Less, less dressy maybe.
3134980	3136980	I don't know.
3136980	3138980	This is dressy?
3139980	3142980	BJ's...BJ's...BJ?
3142980	3145980	I love BJ.
3145980	3148980	I love Erin.
3148980	3149980	Oh man.
3149980	3151980	BJ's super smart and great.
3151980	3153980	I don't know, it's so silly to...
3153980	3156980	We went to Hot Dogs one time and I drove BJ home and we had a big old time
3156980	3159980	and I think your lighter is still in my car, by the way, if you want it.
3159980	3160980	Really?
3160980	3162980	Yeah, I would love that.
3162980	3164980	I recently...
3164980	3168980	BJ's been walking the earth looking for a lighter.
3168980	3170980	Who else wants to just wander up on stage?
3170980	3172980	Does anybody...
3172980	3174980	Let's get...
3174980	3176980	I think all the people that want to wander on stage...
3176980	3178980	Adam Goldberg, get up here.
3178980	3180980	Adam Goldberg.
3180980	3182980	Oh, he's getting mic.
3182980	3184980	Here, wow.
3184980	3186980	Tomorrow...
3186980	3190980	Let's just steer into this spin.
3190980	3193980	I want to see how many donuts this car can do.
3193980	3196980	This train only goes forward.
3196980	3199980	If we ever had brake lines, we don't have them now.
3199980	3202980	Except when I say a joke, because that's a pause.
3202980	3204980	Adam, tomorrow is your birthday.
3204980	3207980	Tomorrow is my birthday.
3207980	3210980	Quarter century club, I'm excited about that.
3210980	3212980	Adam, talk to BJ.
3212980	3213980	I will do my best.
3213980	3215980	What's up, BJ?
3215980	3216980	Hi, Adam.
3216980	3217980	Yes, go right ahead.
3217980	3219980	It is vanilla.
3219980	3220980	Hey, Adam.
3220980	3223980	I'm not afraid of him. He's just like you.
3223980	3226980	Maybe just is overselling it a bit.
3230980	3233980	Adam Goldberg stuck his finger in BJ's pink berry,
3233980	3234980	and when everyone went,
3234980	3236980	oh, Adam's response was to say,
3236980	3239980	I'm not afraid of him.
3239980	3241980	That's what they were just saying.
3241980	3243980	Which I think means that he's afraid of him.
3243980	3245980	That was a total power move, by the way.
3245980	3247980	I want to put a finger in there.
3247980	3250980	Well, he was sunning you,
3250980	3255980	not in the sense of the heliocentric body, the sun.
3255980	3256980	Oh, we're familiar.
3256980	3258980	Yes.
3258980	3259980	Like Sunday.
3259980	3261980	It's not here tonight, Dan.
3261980	3263980	There's a dark place.
3263980	3266980	Just pretend that only Dan can hear me right now.
3266980	3268980	Dan, if we just keep bringing people up here,
3268980	3270980	you and I can leave.
3270980	3273980	Tyler, Tyler, go up and share Adam's mic.
3273980	3276980	Tyler, Tyler to the stage.
3276980	3278980	By the way, can I just point out
3278980	3281980	that we were talking about the Mona Lisa when this happened.
3281980	3284980	Oh, yeah.
3284980	3286980	I don't know how this happened.
3286980	3287980	Talk to BJ.
3287980	3288980	That's what brought me up here.
3288980	3289980	No, BJ's awesome.
3289980	3290980	I'll try to bite out of this.
3290980	3293980	I wanted to talk about Paris.
3293980	3295980	I've heard people talking about Paris.
3295980	3296980	Have you been to Paris?
3296980	3297980	Not to this person.
3297980	3298980	Yeah.
3298980	3300980	Hey, hey.
3300980	3301980	So you went to Paris?
3301980	3302980	Going to security for you must be easy,
3302980	3304980	where they're like, take off your shoes.
3304980	3307980	They're like, ha ha.
3307980	3309980	One step ahead of you.
3309980	3310980	Be fungus Bill.
3310980	3312980	Get up here.
3312980	3315980	Be fungus Bill to the stage.
3315980	3319980	I feel like this is like the season finale of The Muppet Show.
3319980	3320980	Oh.
3320980	3321980	Is anyone here in my bag?
3321980	3325980	Gladys Knight and the Pips, come on out.
3325980	3327980	Try to leave, but they keep calling me back in.
3327980	3328980	Be fungus Bill.
3328980	3329980	How you doing, mate?
3329980	3330980	I'm doing all right.
3330980	3331980	How are you?
3331980	3332980	I have this.
3332980	3333980	How did you get this?
3334980	3335980	That was a real power move.
3335980	3336980	B.J.?
3336980	3337980	Nobody knows what's going on up here right now.
3337980	3339980	B.J. was one of the first people I met when I came to Harmondand.
3339980	3340980	B.J. and Aaron, both.
3340980	3341980	All right.
3341980	3344980	Everybody in the front row just come up on stage.
3344980	3345980	Everybody just come up.
3345980	3346980	Yeah.
3346980	3347980	Yeah.
3347980	3349980	Anatoly wearing the cat shirt.
3349980	3353980	Anatoly's wearing the same shirt that Andrew was wearing last week.
3353980	3354980	Okay.
3354980	3357980	Now everybody, we're going to go shirts and skins.
3357980	3358980	Jay.
3358980	3359980	Jay.
3359980	3361980	Hey, what's up, guys?
3361980	3362980	All right.
3363980	3364980	All right.
3365980	3367980	Now, what if we blew everyone else in the audience's mind
3367980	3369980	and we had a perfect dance routine up playing golf?
3369980	3371980	That would be pretty good.
3371980	3373980	Wait, Anatoly, are you wearing Andrew's cat shirt?
3373980	3374980	Yeah.
3374980	3375980	Fantastic, man.
3375980	3376980	Wow.
3376980	3377980	All right.
3377980	3379980	So, have we hit rock bottom or?
3379980	3381980	We're just about there, Dan.
3381980	3382980	I don't know why.
3382980	3385980	I think we should all sing Edelweiss like from earlier on.
3385980	3387980	Everybody, one, two.
3387980	3390980	Edelweiss.
3390980	3391980	Okay, get the fuck off the stage.
3391980	3392980	Thank you, guys, for coming up.
3392980	3393980	All right.
3393980	3396980	Let's have a hand for everybody but Kumail, everybody.
3396980	3398980	Everybody but Kumail.
3398980	3399980	Thank you.
3399980	3400980	Thank you for joining us.
3400980	3401980	Thank you, Beef Fungus Bill.
3401980	3404980	Adam, Anatoly, BJ, Tyler.
3404980	3405980	Who else was up here?
3405980	3406980	Lauren.
3406980	3407980	Kurt, Greg.
3407980	3408980	Kurt.
3408980	3409980	Kurt.
3409980	3410980	Jay, what's going on, man?
3410980	3411980	It's always good when they drop by.
3411980	3413980	That was pretty awesome.
3413980	3414980	That was fucking great.
3414980	3415980	Yeah.
3415980	3416980	So, not a lot happened while you were gone.
3416980	3420980	Well, with BJ, I've never had more questions for a person
3420980	3424980	none of which I really want answered.
3424980	3426980	I've hung out with BJ a few times
3426980	3428980	and we've played some catchphrase back at your place and stuff
3428980	3429980	and he's a great guy.
3429980	3430980	I mean, if I just met him, I would say,
3430980	3434980	that guy seems like he's ripped on ludes.
3434980	3437980	Costume change!
3437980	3438980	By the way, BJ's back.
3438980	3442980	Completely different outfit.
3442980	3446980	I thought I heard someone mention being ripped on ludes.
3446980	3449980	Have you ever done coyludes, BJ?
3450980	3452980	Can you get a coylude anymore?
3452980	3454980	By the way, if we take a picture of you,
3454980	3455980	this is...
3455980	3457980	He's very shy, everybody.
3457980	3459980	Please don't take his picture.
3459980	3462980	I'm trying not to get any more famous.
3462980	3464980	All right, but now this vacuum that happens,
3464980	3467980	you come up and it's like the excitement
3467980	3469980	and then air gets sucked out of the room.
3469980	3470980	Are you still...
3470980	3471980	Oh, really?
3471980	3472980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3472980	3473980	Okay, fix it.
3473980	3474980	Tell us something.
3474980	3476980	If we ask you a question, answer it.
3476980	3477980	I can do that.
3477980	3478980	Okay, cool.
3478980	3480980	Do you still have a big chunk of that money?
3480980	3481980	I've got lots of money.
3481980	3482980	You do have lots of money.
3482980	3483980	Yeah.
3483980	3486980	What do you do every day?
3486980	3489980	I have fancy feasts.
3490980	3492980	The cat food?
3492980	3496980	I'm aware that that's also a brand of cat food.
3496980	3499980	Nothing gets by BJ.
3499980	3501980	What time do you wake up in the morning, BJ?
3501980	3503980	This morning I woke up at 7 a.m.
3503980	3504980	What?
3504980	3506980	With the sun.
3506980	3509980	What was first on your agenda this morning, BJ?
3509980	3510980	I had to move my car.
3510980	3511980	It was parked...
3511980	3512980	You have a car!
3512980	3513980	Yeah.
3513980	3515980	It's a Chrysler LeBaron.
3515980	3516980	It's red.
3516980	3517980	It's a convertible.
3517980	3518980	Red LeBaron.
3518980	3519980	I don't know how to put the top up.
3519980	3520980	Chrysler LeBaron.
3520980	3521980	Yeah.
3521980	3522980	It's parked outside.
3522980	3525980	So you have like a driver's license and everything.
3525980	3527980	Yeah, it's inside that frog.
3527980	3528980	It's back there.
3528980	3530980	I keep forgetting to bring the frog
3530980	3533980	every time I come up here, but it's back there.
3533980	3535980	If someone can grab it and throw it up here,
3536980	3538980	we'll take your word for it.
3538980	3539980	Yeah, we'll just take my word for it.
3539980	3542980	You have a frog-shaped wallet or satchel, probably.
3542980	3543980	Exactly.
3543980	3546980	Don't take the magic away from him, Dan.
3546980	3547980	Yeah.
3547980	3550980	What do you want?
3550980	3552980	Do you like people?
3552980	3553980	I like people?
3553980	3554980	Yeah.
3554980	3555980	Like in general?
3555980	3556980	In general, I like people.
3556980	3558980	I just don't like when they ask me questions or tell me stories.
3558980	3559980	No.
3559980	3561980	So then why did you come up on stage?
3561980	3562980	I'm just kidding.
3562980	3564980	Why do you dress the way you dress if you don't like questions?
3564980	3566980	That's a terrible...
3566980	3568980	That's a terrible choice to make.
3568980	3569980	That was a joke.
3569980	3570980	Oh, okay.
3570980	3572980	That's one for my friend Frankie Tartaglia.
3572980	3573980	I have to give him credit.
3573980	3574980	I didn't come up with it.
3574980	3576980	I actually like people.
3576980	3577980	I thought that was funny.
3577980	3581980	All right, Camille, you get three questions to BJ.
3581980	3583980	Oh, like a troll under a beige.
3583980	3586980	You get to pick three questions to try to...
3586980	3589980	Yeah, a lot like that.
3589980	3591980	To try to crack that nut.
3591980	3593980	To try to get inside the shell.
3593980	3595980	To learn something about beige.
3595980	3596980	All right.
3596980	3597980	One of the three questions.
3597980	3599980	Three questions and you will answer them?
3599980	3600980	Yes.
3600980	3601980	Okay.
3601980	3604980	When was the last time you cried?
3604980	3606980	The last time I cried.
3606980	3607980	I'll tell you the last time I cried.
3607980	3608980	If you tell...
3608980	3609980	No, no, no.
3609980	3610980	You will answer first.
3610980	3613980	Because if I tell mine, then you're not going to answer yours.
3613980	3617980	You don't have to answer it.
3617980	3618980	No, I'll be real.
3618980	3622980	I think the last time I cried was...
3623980	3626980	breaking up with my ex-girlfriend.
3626980	3628980	Okay, when was that?
3628980	3629980	It was...
3629980	3630980	Like how long ago?
3630980	3632980	Well, it was like a few months ago.
3632980	3633980	Okay.
3633980	3634980	All right.
3634980	3636980	Do you want me to...
3636980	3637980	If you are comfortable...
3637980	3638980	Oh, sure, yeah.
3638980	3640980	I mean, this is going to be such a shitty answer.
3640980	3643980	But I did cry looking at some of the paintings in the Louvre.
3643980	3644980	I know shit.
3644980	3645980	Really?
3645980	3646980	Yeah.
3646980	3647980	Really?
3647980	3648980	Well, I saw this one and it was this gorgeous huge...
3648980	3650980	I didn't even look up the name of the painting or the guy
3650980	3652980	because I just didn't want to look him up.
3652980	3653980	And then people are like, oh, he's a hack.
3653980	3656980	You know, I wanted to have that experience.
3656980	3658980	But it said that it took him five years to finish it.
3658980	3660980	And I just started the moment when it was like five years.
3660980	3661980	And he was like the last one.
3661980	3662980	He's like, I'm done.
3662980	3664980	And it's this beautiful big painting.
3664980	3666980	And that moment where he's like, this is what I did.
3666980	3667980	You're crying now?
3667980	3668980	You're getting choked up now?
3668980	3669980	For real, right?
3669980	3670980	Well, just a little...
3670980	3672980	I mean, it's just really...
3672980	3675980	You know, seeing all these people like...
3675980	3677980	doing all this wonderful, beautiful stuff.
3677980	3678980	It was very affecting.
3678980	3679980	I was very affected.
3679980	3680980	The entire time I went to...
3680980	3682980	I think that's what's missing from my life,
3682980	3683980	is any kind of like...
3683980	3686980	I was just like yelling at Aaron tonight about
3686980	3689980	yelling at some kid on the internet about
3689980	3692980	yelling at Sony, about getting yelled at,
3692980	3694980	about yelling, about not being appreciated,
3694980	3696980	about some TV show that I'm making.
3696980	3699980	But I need to go and look at a painting.
3699980	3701980	I probably burst into tears myself.
3701980	3702980	I'd probably rip my own head off.
3702980	3704980	Yeah, I mean, I'm very preoccupied.
3704980	3705980	Like, I'm not like a...
3705980	3707980	You know, I'm angry, you know.
3708980	3709980	And then when I saw the Statue of David...
3709980	3710980	This is true.
3710980	3712980	I saw the Statue of David.
3712980	3713980	It's beautiful.
3713980	3715980	It's huge and perfect.
3715980	3717980	It's beautiful.
3717980	3718980	And then this is true.
3718980	3722980	I saw, then I read that he had finished sculpting it
3722980	3726980	at the age of 29 and finished sculpting it.
3726980	3727980	And this is true.
3727980	3728980	I logged...
3728980	3731980	The first thing I did, I logged out of the wireless at the museum
3731980	3734980	and I canceled my pre-order of GTA 5.
3735980	3736980	For real?
3739980	3743980	But Kamea, I will say, in your defense,
3743980	3750980	back then, yeah, a slab of marble was a video game.
3750980	3754980	Yes, you know what, David is my GTA 5.
3754980	3755980	You're right.
3756980	3758980	That's just him killing time.
3758980	3759980	I went into the...
3759980	3762980	In Florence, to the Uffizi Gallery where...
3762980	3763980	Yeah, it's beautiful.
3763980	3766980	Botticelli's Primavera is, well, you know,
3766980	3767980	which is Venus in the half shell.
3767980	3770980	And you see building a room after room after room
3770980	3771980	after room after room after room
3771980	3773980	of just the things that you were allowed to paint back then,
3773980	3774980	which is religious themes.
3774980	3776980	You just see Jesus and Mary, Mary and Jesus.
3776980	3777980	Yeah.
3777980	3778980	The Annunciation and the Assumption and this and that.
3778980	3779980	And you see Jesus and Mary.
3779980	3780980	The Assumption?
3780980	3781980	Yeah.
3781980	3782980	I don't know if that's a real thing,
3782980	3783980	it's just funny to me.
3783980	3784980	It's not called the Assumption.
3784980	3785980	It'd be a funny, like, fake thing.
3785980	3786980	The Assumption.
3786980	3787980	Yeah, that would be, yeah.
3787980	3788980	It's a painting of a guy.
3788980	3791980	It's like Jesus just walked by him outside an ice cream shop
3791980	3793980	and the painting is capturing the moment of him going,
3793980	3794980	nah.
3794980	3799980	I bet that looked a lot like him at Pinkberry earlier tonight.
3799980	3801980	But you see, like, you see all this stuff
3801980	3803980	and it's all biblical, biblical, biblical, biblical.
3803980	3805980	It was illegal, basically, to paint anything else.
3805980	3807980	And then you walk into a room,
3807980	3809980	and I think it was for one of the Medicis
3809980	3810980	or something like that,
3810980	3812980	and there was a privately commissioned thing
3812980	3813980	that was humanist.
3813980	3816980	It was like mythology stuff, which is naked people
3816980	3818980	that weren't in the Bible, which is, you know,
3818980	3819980	like punk rock as can be.
3820980	3822980	And you walk in and you see a naked woman
3822980	3824980	with sprites and cherubs and stuff,
3824980	3825980	and it's human nudity.
3825980	3828980	And I just, like, plopped down in my chair
3828980	3831980	and it was like hearing, like,
3831980	3835980	like what a seminal rock and roll record would have been
3835980	3837980	if you listened to Lawrence Walk all your life.
3837980	3838980	Like, oh, Jesus Christ.
3838980	3839980	Yeah.
3839980	3841980	Like, never mind the bollocks playing.
3841980	3843980	But it's also, it's beautiful.
3843980	3845980	And I sat there, and there was two other people,
3845980	3847980	and there was a lot of people milling about,
3847980	3848980	but there was two other people.
3848980	3849980	There was an older woman and a younger woman.
3849980	3851980	And everyone, the three of us, like,
3851980	3852980	after sitting there for about 15 minutes,
3852980	3854980	looked at each other, and we were all, like,
3854980	3856980	not crying, but, like, all teared up.
3856980	3857980	Yeah.
3857980	3858980	And we all looked at each other and just gave each other
3858980	3861980	a look like, Jesus Christ.
3861980	3863980	And we had this moment, and we were like, yeah.
3863980	3864980	Yeah, I know.
3864980	3866980	And we just sat there and just dug it for a while.
3866980	3868980	And, like, I've had this experience where I've turned
3868980	3871980	a corner in a museum in Cleveland one time
3871980	3873980	and saw a Cezanne painting that was half finished,
3873980	3875980	and what made me cry is you could see its thumbprint on it.
3875980	3876980	Oh, yeah.
3876980	3877980	And it was the most beautiful drawing I've ever seen.
3877980	3878980	And it was half finished.
3878980	3880980	You could see he just gave up on it.
3880980	3881980	And I just went, I just, like, gah!
3881980	3883980	It was, like, completely came apart crying.
3883980	3884980	Well, you see the David.
3884980	3887980	There's, like, six other huge marble blocks
3887980	3889980	that Da Vinci never finished.
3889980	3891980	I mean, that Michelangelo never finished.
3891980	3892980	And she walked down the hallway.
3892980	3893980	Yeah.
3893980	3895980	So it's all these blocks that, and so it looks
3895980	3898980	like these figures are trying to escape from these blocks.
3898980	3899980	But he had, like, David prototypes?
3899980	3900980	Is that what you're describing?
3900980	3901980	No, he, after the David.
3901980	3902980	This is the crazy thing.
3902980	3904980	After the David, he was commissioned to make,
3904980	3906980	like, these six other ones.
3906980	3908980	And halfway through, this is true,
3908980	3909980	the funding fell through.
3909980	3911980	So when you feel bad about, like,
3911980	3913980	a guy who made a great movie, you're like,
3913980	3914980	he can't get another movie made?
3914980	3915980	That movie was great.
3915980	3919980	The guy who made the statue of David
3919980	3921980	couldn't get his next statue done.
3921980	3923980	So it's, like, six of these.
3923980	3925980	And it's all, like, these blocks and these characters,
3925980	3927980	like, that he's sort of carved but not finished.
3927980	3929980	So they look like they're trying to escape from this block.
3929980	3931980	Well, believe it or not, I think somebody
3931980	3932980	whose arts didn't correct me if I'm wrong,
3932980	3935980	but I love when geniuses describe the way they're geniuses.
3935980	3937980	Like, Bobby Fischer, the way he talks about chess.
3937980	3938980	Oh, yeah.
3938980	3941980	Michelangelo said that God put the image
3941980	3942980	inside this block of marble.
3942980	3946980	I have just the shitty task of removing the excess.
3946980	3948980	Well, that's the thing, is that if I was a guy who was,
3948980	3950980	like, giving me a tip on sculpting and he said that,
3950980	3953980	I'd be like, you don't have to be a dick about it.
3953980	3955980	That's the thing, like, that's the thing that drives me crazy
3955980	3960980	is, like, I want to talk about, like, how passionate I am
3960980	3962980	about, like, you know, making stuff.
3962980	3964980	But you do, like, when you run it through your head,
3964980	3966980	because it does sound like stuff like that.
3966980	3967980	Yeah.
3967980	3968980	And you go, like, oh, I'm just going to sound like
3968980	3970980	the biggest dick in the world.
3970980	3971980	Yeah, that's why.
3971980	3972980	But it's the most selfless stuff, because you're like,
3972980	3974980	oh, shit, like, what are you going to say?
3974980	3978980	Like, God wrote Community Episode 4 in Season 2, you know?
3978980	3980980	Like, it's not me, it's God.
3980980	3982980	But the thing that you want to communicate, though,
3982980	3988980	is the rapture of, like, the idea that there's a creative
3988980	3990980	dimension, I think Campbell talked about,
3990980	3994980	that there's shit outside of you that's already done,
3994980	3998980	and that you're, like, you get to participate in the...
3998980	3999980	Yeah, you grab it from the ether.
3999980	4002980	Like, you're just like this weird splotch of iodine
4002980	4004980	that gets thrown onto a microscope slide and reveals
4004980	4006980	this thing that was already there.
4006980	4009980	And, like, you might be a hack, like, you know,
4009980	4012980	it's like the middle of the road guy, like,
4012980	4014980	maybe he's just doing a sitcom, you might be making,
4014980	4017980	like, an industrial training video in Pittsburgh
4017980	4019980	about how to screw in a light bulb without getting electrocuted.
4019980	4021980	You might be doing the Sistine Chapel, like,
4021980	4024980	it's different kinds of iodine, but, like, it's all part of this,
4024980	4027980	like, you're just getting, like, splats, you know?
4027980	4030980	But it's, like, it's mostly frustration,
4030980	4032980	it's mostly incompletion, it's like,
4032980	4034980	I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing,
4034980	4037980	and then, like, one second every five years of, like,
4037980	4041980	oh, splat, I did it, I arrived,
4041980	4044980	I'm a sperm cell that got annihilated by this egg,
4044980	4046980	and someone else gets a baby.
4046980	4048980	And that's what's wonderful about being at the Louvre
4048980	4052980	is that it's all those splats, one after the other.
4052980	4054980	Yeah, they're collecting all of the...
4054980	4056980	Yeah, all those splats.
4056980	4058980	I never thought about it that way.
4058980	4060980	It was like a book copy of Pre-Asia.
4060980	4062980	It's like a big collection of...
4062980	4064980	Like a book copy of Pre-Asia.
4064980	4066980	Really good paintings.
4066980	4070980	Dan, you went...
4070980	4074980	Episode 72, Dan Harmon realizes what art is
4074980	4076980	and why museums are important.
4076980	4079980	What was hard for me was,
4079980	4081980	so I don't know anything about painting,
4081980	4084980	but I was there and I was having real connection to it,
4084980	4088980	and I realized, like, music and painting are things
4088980	4091980	that you can really get someone in the split second
4091980	4094980	and just grab them emotionally with writing,
4094980	4096980	which is, you know, what we do.
4096980	4098980	There's an intellectual component to it,
4098980	4100980	so there's a little bit more processing going on,
4100980	4105980	but with music or art, it can be so almost animalistic.
4105980	4107980	It feels like when you get it, like, grab something inside you,
4107980	4109980	no matter what your background is,
4109980	4112980	and you just, like, have this, you know, it really resonates.
4112980	4114980	I was kind of, like, a little bummed out
4114980	4116980	seeing all this stuff and being like,
4116980	4117980	I'll never do any of this.
4117980	4119980	I mean, it's not...
4119980	4121980	It's amazing that it resonates.
4121980	4123980	I think the one thing you should take away from it
4123980	4125980	as a pep talk, as an individual creative to another,
4125980	4128980	is that you're a tuned enough antenna
4128980	4131980	that that brought tears to you is a good sign.
4131980	4134980	You're not supposed to walk in there
4134980	4136980	and go, like, let's find out how I hold up.
4136980	4140980	You're like, I know, it's the worst bar to try and clear.
4140980	4143980	All right, DaVinci, let's see what you got.
4143980	4146980	But also, like, all right, DaVinci on your best day.
4146980	4149980	Like, not DaVinci on an open mic working his shit out.
4149980	4151980	What's also crazy is DaVinci was a scientist,
4151980	4154980	and after he died, they found plans for a helicopter
4154980	4156980	and for solar panels and a calculator.
4156980	4159980	But also for AIDS, also for AIDS.
4159980	4160980	They suppressed it.
4160980	4161980	A bit from Call of Duty.
4161980	4163980	People think that DaVinci's so amazing,
4163980	4166980	the helicopter, the jetpack, AIDS.
4166980	4169980	He designed AIDS, and no one will acknowledge that.
4169980	4173980	Are you jib-jabbing DaVinci?
4173980	4176980	Nothing is sacred.
4176980	4177980	Wolf Blaser.
4177980	4179980	Little sketches of AIDS.
4179980	4181980	But it really is.
4181980	4182980	Like, he was like a sign.
4182980	4184980	Next to the spiral, like, out there.
4184980	4187980	I want to go back, you know, to the unfinished,
4187980	4189980	because I was in that same room at the academia.
4189980	4190980	Did you see those, yeah.
4190980	4192980	And you see those, and it's really like,
4192980	4194980	they do seem to be frozen in the ice
4194980	4196980	or emerging unsuccessfully.
4196980	4197980	It's very visceral seeing it.
4197980	4201980	To lose funding, they already bought the marble.
4201980	4204980	I bet that's what those rich fuckers were betting on, though.
4204980	4206980	That's the thing that makes me happy about hearing
4206980	4207980	about the half-finished David,
4207980	4209980	is that he had the balls to walk away.
4209980	4211980	Like, fuck you, fuck you, man.
4211980	4213980	Like, I bet that's what they thought.
4213980	4216980	They probably bet on his craftsmanship.
4216980	4218980	Like, why don't you just finish it anyway?
4218980	4220980	I'm working on getting a loan, and he's like, fuck you.
4220980	4221980	I'll go carve another rock.
4221980	4224980	He was like, I'll go make the Sistine Chapel in Rome.
4224980	4225980	And then he fucking did that.
4225980	4227980	Because I saw the David, and I was like, all right,
4227980	4229980	everyone can have one great day.
4229980	4230980	What else you got?
4230980	4231980	And you see the Sistine Chapel.
4231980	4232980	You're like, oh, OK.
4232980	4235980	Also this.
4235980	4236980	Also this.
4236980	4238980	Sistine Chapel got me, too.
4238980	4241980	I looked up, and I said, there's one, like, there's the,
4241980	4245980	what's it, the judgment day on one wall,
4245980	4247980	and then you have the garden at them up there.
4247980	4249980	Which you, that's the one you see a lot,
4249980	4252980	but that's, like, 1 50th of the whole thing.
4252980	4255980	Then aligning it are these giant curved parts along the sides,
4255980	4257980	like railings of the chapel.
4257980	4258980	And they're huge.
4258980	4261980	And he painted upside down on a curved surface,
4261980	4263980	things that read absolutely two dimensionally.
4263980	4266980	Like, they don't look curved, and they still look three
4266980	4267980	dimensional surfaces.
4267980	4269980	And that was just demoralizing.
4269980	4270980	Like, that's unbelievable.
4270980	4273980	But I heard he stole a lot of that stuff from the Sistine
4273980	4275980	floor.
4275980	4277980	And a lot of people don't realize, you know,
4277980	4279980	you never look down when you go into that place.
4279980	4280980	But it's.
4280980	4281980	He took that.
4281980	4283980	There's a guy named Harold Johnson that did the Sistine
4283980	4284980	floor.
4284980	4286980	And it's gorgeous.
4286980	4287980	And he did it first.
4287980	4288980	They did the floor first.
4288980	4290980	It looks like perfect rectangles.
4290980	4292980	That's what my friend was telling me.
4292980	4294980	You know, I went to the Louvre, and she was telling me, like,
4294980	4295980	what to go see.
4295980	4297980	And she was like, and then go see the Mona Lisa,
4297980	4298980	which is fine.
4298980	4301980	And I was like, you just whatever the Mona Lisa.
4301980	4304980	And I don't, now I don't feel as bad about some of the comments
4304980	4307980	that people make about me online.
4307980	4308980	Yeah.
4308980	4309980	Yeah.
4309980	4310980	Yeah.
4310980	4311980	Because people are looking at the Mona Lisa.
4311980	4312980	Yeah.
4312980	4313980	They should have a comment section under the page.
4313980	4314980	Oh, yeah.
4314980	4315980	That would be an amazing spiritual journey.
4315980	4316980	Yeah.
4316980	4317980	Just go.
4317980	4318980	Like, yeah.
4318980	4319980	There'd just be some guy who goes, she's kind of racist,
4319980	4320980	you know, like under something.
4320980	4321980	And he would be like, oh.
4321980	4322980	Just everybody's like, hey.
4322980	4323980	I saw the Mona Lisa.
4323980	4324980	It's really small.
4324980	4326980	Dude, people said that to me.
4326980	4327980	It's really small.
4327980	4328980	I was like.
4328980	4329980	That should make it better.
4329980	4330980	It's the biggest.
4330980	4331980	Yeah.
4331980	4332980	It's the most well-known portrait of all time.
4332980	4333980	It's too small.
4333980	4334980	It's like a vintage stamp, but that's even better.
4334980	4335980	Yeah.
4335980	4339980	Well, I just think like, whatever.
4339980	4340980	People said that to me.
4340980	4341980	Because she's smiling or not.
4341980	4342980	I can't even tell.
4342980	4343980	Yeah.
4343980	4344980	That like really got.
4344980	4345980	Won't she?
4345980	4346980	Won't she?
4346980	4348980	Guys, I have one word for you.
4348980	4349980	Museum of Jurassic Technology.
4349980	4350980	Oh, yeah.
4350980	4351980	That's great.
4351980	4356980	Hey, don't talk unless you have a microphone.
4356980	4358980	Museum of Jurassic.
4358980	4362980	Do you want to explain what that, have you been to the Museum of Jurassic Technology?
4362980	4363980	Yeah.
4363980	4364980	I've heard about it.
4364980	4365980	It's like an art installation.
4365980	4368980	It's not real, like.
4368980	4370980	That real Jurassic technology.
4370980	4371980	Yeah.
4371980	4372980	It's an art installation.
4372980	4373980	Why do you love it?
4373980	4375980	Have you been to the roof?
4375980	4376980	No.
4376980	4379980	Whenever you go to a building, check out the roof first.
4379980	4384980	When you get there, BJ will be there.
4384980	4387980	And he will give you some pinkberry.
4387980	4389980	And give you your next clue.
4389980	4397980	Not everything is the amazing race, bro.
4397980	4399980	He's been corrupted by the amazing race.
4399980	4400980	Yeah.
4400980	4401980	He thinks life is like, all right.
4401980	4402980	Where's my next clue?
4402980	4403980	When was the last time you cried?
4403980	4406980	That's the last time I cried.
4406980	4407980	I cried.
4407980	4411980	The answer will be absolutely unacceptable because the answer will definitely be because
4411980	4412980	I'm working on Community.
4412980	4417980	It'll be because while I was breaking a story of my own about my show, about people going
4417980	4418980	to college.
4418980	4419980	But I cry.
4419980	4424980	I cry when a story works.
4424980	4427980	It's like I'll be going.
4427980	4429980	And it's really embarrassing sometimes.
4429980	4435980	Like if I'm in a room full of writers and I'm like, I'll go like, well, it's like, you
4435980	4436980	know.
4436980	4437980	Oh, hell no.
4437980	4441980	That works perfectly because then Troy has to say goodbye to op-ed.
4441980	4447980	I'll just hear my voice doing that.
4447980	4450980	That's a bad example because that sounds sad.
4450980	4452980	It's happening right now a little bit.
4452980	4453980	Well, because I can remember.
4453980	4458980	I can have sense of memory of what it feels like for a story to finally.
4458980	4461980	Something that is not yielding.
4461980	4467980	Because stories, like when you're working on them, you're working on this thing as I've
4468980	4471980	talked about that it's like, oh, it's just not.
4471980	4478980	It's kind of like some sappy movie about a kid and a horse or something.
4478980	4481980	And it's like the horse doesn't want to eat out of the kid's hand or something.
4481980	4486980	So it's like this miraculous moment when this thing is behaving properly.
4486980	4489980	Because it's finally chosen you and it wants to do something.
4489980	4492980	And you're like, Jesus fucking Christ.
4492980	4498980	The pain that I've gone through, yeah, that's it.
4498980	4500980	It's an emotional reaction.
4500980	4505980	It's sort of like this salt water squirting out of your eyes.
4505980	4510980	Whether what you specifically broke was a truly sad moment about a character loving
4510980	4512980	his father or something, or just a fart joke.
4512980	4516980	It could really, if it clicks, it kind of like is an emotional experience for me.
4516980	4517980	Catharsis.
4517980	4519980	Catharsis, yes.
4519980	4521980	Just yell anything out.
4521980	4526980	I'm crying up here.
4526980	4531980	Connecting dots verbally.
4531980	4532980	That is.
4532980	4535980	That's what made me cry about that painting was that moment when it finally is like,
4535980	4536980	oh, I'm done.
4536980	4539980	And that's what you're talking about is that moment where you're like,
4539980	4541980	I mean, there's a lot more work to do.
4541980	4543980	But where you're like, oh, I did something.
4543980	4545980	And this works.
4545980	4547980	And it's beautiful.
4547980	4549980	It doesn't even have to, yeah.
4550980	4553980	I wish I could store all that information so I could study it.
4553980	4559980	Because with 80, 80 plus whatever episodes of community going through that process
4559980	4562980	every time, there's been so many wasted tears.
4562980	4565980	So many times when it's been like, we got it.
4565980	4566980	We got it.
4566980	4569980	And feeling so good about something that ends up being like, oh, shit,
4569980	4570980	this doesn't work.
4570980	4572980	It's funny.
4572980	4576980	We toil at the feet of this thing that just taunts us.
4579980	4582980	Jeff, do you want to answer about crying?
4582980	4583980	Yeah.
4583980	4585980	I took this huge shit.
4585980	4590980	Jeff was like, I looked and it was 9-11 and I cried.
4590980	4594980	I cried today right before I came here.
4594980	4596980	I cry about music a lot.
4596980	4597980	I'm a crier.
4597980	4599980	I cry about movies.
4599980	4601980	I cry like weather.
4601980	4603980	I get kind of overwhelmed by things.
4603980	4606980	Like if something strikes me as incredibly singular,
4606980	4608980	I just get really overcome by stuff.
4608980	4611980	I've always been with people like if I get yelled at
4611980	4613980	when I was like bossed around on the playground,
4613980	4615980	like when I get angry, I think, Dan, we had the same thing.
4615980	4619980	When you get angry, my emotions well up and tears start falling.
4619980	4624980	So I cry happy more than I cry sad, but I cry happy all the time.
4624980	4627980	So today, there's a song called She by Charles Asmivore.
4627980	4629980	Elvis Costello covered it.
4629980	4631980	Oh, yeah, I've heard the Elvis Costello version.
4631980	4633980	Jeff Lynn gets an awesome version of it.
4633980	4636980	And there's a lyric at the end of that that's just like I can't,
4636980	4639980	I just was singing at my apartment, and I get to the end of it,
4639980	4641980	and I just, I can't even talk.
4641980	4642980	I can't sing it.
4642980	4646980	I can't even, like, my throat closes up,
4646980	4648980	and it just makes me start crying.
4648980	4651980	And what it is, it's just beautifully written.
4651980	4654980	And it expresses, it's a little turn that it makes,
4654980	4656980	where it's like it's not she, she, she, she, she.
4656980	4659980	When it goes to me, then he goes, me,
4659980	4661980	I'll take her laughter and her tears
4661980	4663980	and make them all my souvenirs.
4663980	4665980	And when it becomes about, like,
4665980	4667980	this is the effect that she has on me,
4667980	4669980	then it becomes way more about she.
4669980	4671980	And then every, just like every time,
4671980	4672980	there's a lot of songs I'll sing in the shower,
4672980	4674980	and it's like that, all of a sudden, I'll just like,
4674980	4675980	I'll just have to stop.
4675980	4677980	And I really, I'm just like, I'm sobbing.
4677980	4679980	Like, a music overwhelms me all the time.
4679980	4681980	Do you, the album that always makes me cry is,
4681980	4683980	do you guys know Warren Zevon?
4683980	4684980	Warren Zevon.
4684980	4686980	And everyone knows where it was.
4686980	4688980	I almost played a Warren Zevon song tonight.
4688980	4691980	His last, he found out he was going to die of lung cancer
4691980	4692980	and he had three months to live,
4692980	4694980	and he was like, I gotta make a fucking album before I die.
4694980	4696980	So this album is just like goodbye to the world.
4696980	4697980	It's called The Wind.
4697980	4699980	And it is, it's so beautiful,
4699980	4702980	because you could hear that he's very weak,
4702980	4706980	and he has such a great, like, he's so at peace with it.
4706980	4708980	Like, when he did the press conference
4708980	4710980	to announce that he was going to die in three months,
4710980	4712980	he said, in his press conference,
4712980	4714980	he said, I just want to live long enough
4714980	4716980	to see the new Bond movie.
4716980	4718980	I hear they're taking it in a new direction.
4718980	4720980	No pressure.
4720980	4723980	And that was Christina Royale, so they did.
4723980	4725980	They took it in a new direction.
4725980	4726980	Yeah, you must have really.
4726980	4728980	Yeah, special thanks, Warren Zevon.
4728980	4730980	But that album was really, really good.
4730980	4732980	There's this album, one song called
4732980	4734980	Keep Me In Your Heart for a While,
4734980	4735980	which is like, it's not like a grand thing.
4735980	4736980	It's like, I'm going to die soon.
4736980	4738980	Just keep me in your heart for a while,
4738980	4740980	you know, just for a little bit and then whatever.
4740980	4741980	Like, think of me every now and then.
4741980	4742980	It's really wonderful.
4742980	4744980	You know, I'm finding, like,
4744980	4746980	I have a really crazy memory for lyrics.
4746980	4748980	I remember songs I learned when I was a little kid.
4748980	4749980	Like, I did a lot of musical theater.
4749980	4751980	I know all the lyrics.
4751980	4752980	The ABCD song.
4752980	4753980	I know that one.
4753980	4754980	Twinkle Twinkle.
4754980	4755980	Same melody.
4755980	4757980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4757980	4759980	Somebody should get sued.
4759980	4761980	But, like, going back and listening to songs
4761980	4762980	that you learned when you were a kid
4762980	4765980	and you didn't really know what the meaning was about it.
4765980	4767980	All of a sudden, these little epiphanies,
4767980	4769980	oh, that's what it's about.
4769980	4771980	Those moments really hit me right in the eye.
4771980	4774980	I was a little kid and I loved Four Weddings and a Funeral.
4774980	4776980	And it wasn't until the 10th time I watched it
4776980	4778980	that I realized that those two characters were gay.
4778980	4781980	And that, like, changed my life.
4781980	4783980	I was like, I guess they're not so bad.
4783980	4784980	It's true.
4784980	4787980	Like, you know, grew up very homophobic and stuff.
4787980	4788980	Very religious.
4788980	4791980	But that was part of the reason watching that movie.
4791980	4792980	I was like, oh, okay.
4792980	4793980	You know, people do whatever they want.
4793980	4796980	I was watching West Side Story on TCM, like, a few months ago.
4796980	4801980	And I cried, like, openly, alone at my place.
4801980	4803980	But not at one of the sad songs.
4803980	4805980	I went to be in America.
4805980	4806980	You know why?
4807980	4809980	Because it's a fucking good number.
4809980	4810980	It's a fucking good song.
4810980	4811980	Which one?
4811980	4812980	I want to be in America.
4812980	4813980	Okay.
4813980	4814980	I want to be in America.
4814980	4815980	It's fucking good.
4815980	4818980	And the guy that plays, who's the sexy dude, like, what's his name?
4818980	4819980	Bernardo.
4819980	4820980	Bernardo.
4820980	4821980	He fucking rules.
4821980	4822980	He's so good.
4822980	4823980	And the music is great.
4823980	4825980	And, like, what's her name?
4825980	4826980	Cheetah Rivera?
4826980	4828980	Like, it's just so good.
4828980	4830980	It's just like a triumphant moment.
4830980	4832980	Like, there's like little things like that.
4832980	4834980	You go, like, that really fucking came together.
4834980	4837980	That's 200 people making something happen.
4837980	4840980	That's another thing that always gets me is, like,
4840980	4842980	is when it's humanity working as one thing.
4842980	4844980	Like, I went to a space shuttle launch, and it's moving.
4844980	4847980	Like, there's six people on that fucking thing.
4847980	4850980	And, like, it's like, I just sobbing, crying.
4850980	4854980	And there was a guy next to me, and he's a colonel in the Air Force.
4854980	4856980	And he was sobbing, crying.
4856980	4857980	He had a friend on board that thing.
4857980	4861980	I thought he was gonna, he turns to you, suck it up, pussy.
4861980	4862980	Just get this bird in the air.
4862980	4865980	You're not gonna do it with your tears.
4865980	4866980	He's standing next to me.
4866980	4867980	I knew, like, we had talked about it before.
4867980	4869980	He goes, he's got a buddy on board this thing.
4869980	4871980	It was, like, the last launch of Atlantis, I think.
4871980	4872980	Or second to last.
4872980	4873980	Supposed to be the last.
4873980	4875980	But they added one more, I think.
4875980	4878980	And so when it went up, I was just like, my jaw hit my chest,
4878980	4880980	and I was just screaming.
4880980	4881980	Not, like, crying.
4881980	4882980	Yeah.
4882980	4884980	Just a steady flow of tears.
4884980	4886980	Like, I've never really cried like that.
4886980	4887980	It was just complete awe.
4887980	4890980	I mean, it's crazy to think that, you know,
4891980	4893980	billions of years ago, the sun supernovas,
4893980	4896980	and, like, one piece of dust or whatever settles where Earth is,
4896980	4898980	and it just happens to spin and cool.
4898980	4901980	The hot gases spin and spin for eons, and then they cool,
4901980	4904980	and it sort of forms out that it just happens to be habitable.
4904980	4906980	Cut to us, like, launching shit into space.
4906980	4909980	And next to me is this guy who looks like the great Santini.
4909980	4911980	He's just, you know, he's like, he's a badass, you know,
4911980	4914980	pilot, test pilot, tough guy, ex-astronaut.
4914980	4915980	And I know he's got a buddy on board,
4915980	4918980	but he's being very sang-fua about it, and, you know, very, like,
4919980	4921980	and he was saying, like, you know, people don't really cheer.
4921980	4923980	It's like, just so you know, when it launches,
4923980	4925980	a lot of people cheer, but the people that have been to these before,
4925980	4927980	they don't cheer until the solid rocket booster's detached.
4927980	4928980	Sure.
4928980	4930980	Because when those are still lit and they're still attached to it,
4930980	4932980	anything can go wrong, and there's no way to abort it.
4932980	4935980	Once they release, there's a possible way things go wrong
4935980	4937980	to have them return to the landing site.
4937980	4939980	Yeah, I mean, they're going into space against God.
4939980	4942980	Yeah, and things can go wrong.
4942980	4945980	And they're strapped to a bomb that they can't turn off,
4945980	4947980	until those run off, and, like, once the SRB is detached,
4947980	4950980	then there's a way from the nose over and do a return to landing site,
4950980	4952980	which has never been done, thank God.
4952980	4954980	Did you tell him that there's a traditional, like,
4954980	4957980	there's things that can go wrong when you're telling people how to cheer?
4957980	4958980	Well, no, no.
4958980	4960980	I was asking him a million questions.
4960980	4961980	Oh, okay.
4961980	4962980	I wanted to know everything.
4962980	4964980	So if that was unsolicited, I'm sorry.
4964980	4968980	No, he was just saying, like, I said, how many of these have you been to?
4968980	4971980	Then I find out that he is a pilot and that he's got a buddy on board.
4971980	4975980	So I was just like, were you here for the Challenger?
4975980	4976980	He goes, yes, I was.
4976980	4977980	I go, was that like we talked about that?
4977980	4978980	Oh, my God.
4978980	4980980	And so that's when he's saying, it's like, since then,
4980980	4982980	we don't cheer until the SRBs are released.
4982980	4984980	And I go, wow.
4984980	4986980	And so when I was having my own moments,
4986980	4990980	and I'm filming it very poorly on my iPhone,
4990980	4991980	which is like not looking through it,
4991980	4993980	but it's like holding it up kind of in the direction of it,
4993980	4994980	and I'm crying.
4994980	4996980	And I look over at the thing that got me,
4996980	4999980	I mean, among all the things was this guy was going,
4999980	5002980	go up minus, go up minus.
5002980	5003980	Like crying.
5003980	5005980	He's like, make it.
5005980	5007980	And everybody there, I said, I'll start crying now.
5007980	5009980	It's friends and family going, fucking,
5009980	5012980	get those fucking solid rocket boosters off and make it.
5012980	5018980	And it was just like, there's something incredibly like,
5018980	5021980	you know, like we get so irritated by little things humans do,
5021980	5024980	and I'm such a road ragey, you know, cock on the road and stuff like that.
5024980	5026980	Everything's irritable and Rush can go fuck himself,
5026980	5029980	and what's, what's, what's, what's here.
5029980	5031980	But you know what, Rush can go fuck himself.
5031980	5032980	I know, I know.
5032980	5034980	But, but the thing is like the beauty of like,
5034980	5036980	it doesn't have to be people going into space,
5036980	5038980	which is the craziest thing in the world,
5038980	5041980	but it's just crazy to go like, like it's,
5041980	5044980	it's a very human moment where I just go like,
5044980	5045980	like we're awesome.
5045980	5047980	Like we're really cool.
5047980	5048980	Yeah.
5048980	5049980	And we have so much mental capacity,
5049980	5051980	and it's very difficult to do all the things we do.
5051980	5053980	I don't know how you put lead in the fucking pencil,
5053980	5054980	like we're like,
5054980	5057980	but there's heroic shit that goes on to every little thing that we do.
5057980	5060980	And it doesn't have to be going into space to make you realize that,
5060980	5064980	but there's so much natural heroism that,
5064980	5066980	that's the stuff that always gets me.
5066980	5069980	And then you realize how, how brief it all is.
5069980	5072980	Like that's, that's, that's the beauty of it.
5072980	5073980	Yeah.
5073980	5075980	So that's why sunsets are sad, you know?
5075980	5076980	Yeah.
5076980	5077980	It's like one day closer to death.
5077980	5078980	It really is.
5078980	5080980	I think that's genuinely part of the reason why,
5080980	5083980	like I think seasons are very like,
5083980	5086980	I always connected to seasons when I, you know,
5086980	5087980	when I was in Chicago and stuff.
5087980	5089980	And I feel like part of the reason that California,
5089980	5093980	people can be so cocky and get all that work done and stuff is like,
5093980	5095980	they don't see seasons.
5095980	5099980	They don't see like life dying and coming back and dying and coming back.
5099980	5101980	So then one day they look in the mirror and they're like,
5101980	5102980	I look slightly old.
5102980	5103980	What the fuck happened?
5103980	5105980	And then they get like work done and stuff.
5105980	5109980	And I really think seasons give you perspective that like, you know,
5109980	5112980	we sort of don't have some, I have a question.
5112980	5113980	I was thinking about this today.
5113980	5115980	This is slightly off topic, but not really.
5115980	5117980	Everyone knows off topic.
5118980	5121980	We all know who the first man on the moon was.
5121980	5124980	How many people know who the first man in space was?
5124980	5125980	Okay.
5125980	5126980	Like four people.
5126980	5127980	His name's Yuri Gagarin.
5127980	5130980	And just because he was Russian, we don't hear about him as much.
5130980	5131980	To me, that's really sad.
5131980	5133980	Cause that's something again, that humanity did.
5133980	5136980	It was in the fucking sixties, the first man in space.
5136980	5140980	Everyone should know his name and we don't know it just cause it's a Russian.
5140980	5142980	And they didn't like Russia back then.
5142980	5144980	It's like, it's like, that like bones me out.
5144980	5145980	Yes.
5146980	5147980	Anatoly.
5147980	5148980	Have you met Anatoly?
5148980	5149980	Was he here before you left?
5149980	5150980	Yes, I've met Anatoly.
5150980	5152980	Our resident Russian.
5156980	5161980	About Gagarin, mostly actually about me.
5163980	5164980	I knew it.
5164980	5166980	This is the least surprising thing.
5167980	5172980	Gagarin here was studied in a city where I grew up.
5172980	5173980	Oh, wow.
5173980	5174980	Yeah.
5174980	5176980	I see so obviously four people raised their hands.
5176980	5179980	One of them was the guy who grew up in the same city as him.
5179980	5181980	That's the name that we should know in town.
5181980	5183980	Are there big statues of him in town?
5183980	5184980	That's great.
5184980	5187980	It's him punching Neil Armstrong in the face.
5189980	5192980	I think everybody knows Yuri Gagarin was the first guy in space.
5192980	5195980	I think maybe they, because you asked it that way, people.
5195980	5196980	Oh, is that right?
5196980	5198980	People paused and was like, maybe it wasn't Yuri Gagarin.
5198980	5200980	Most, a lot of people didn't know.
5200980	5203980	Well, cause I grew up during the, you know, when I learned that it was the cold war.
5203980	5207980	So we were supposed to, if by that argument, maybe they're, maybe they're just past it.
5207980	5208980	They're like space.
5208980	5209980	Fuck that.
5210980	5212980	That is a bummer that that wouldn't have happened.
5212980	5213980	What about that dog?
5213980	5214980	The first thing it was a Russian dog.
5214980	5215980	Laika?
5215980	5216980	Laika.
5216980	5222980	No, it was two dogs and it was ever called Belka and Strelka.
5223980	5224980	Really?
5224980	5225980	Yeah.
5225980	5227980	You made a thing that goes into space.
5227980	5229980	You could name dogs two different things.
5229980	5231980	Rover and Schmover.
5234980	5241980	No, those dogs Anatoly, I'm asking him like, he was there.
5242980	5244980	Those dogs, they didn't come back, right?
5244980	5248980	There's no like, they're just dogs.
5248980	5253980	They're well trained enough that they're like, I mean, I imagine those are the best dogs on the planet.
5253980	5255980	Like the best dogs.
5255980	5256980	And they're like, okay, all right.
5256980	5257980	Whatever you want, boss.
5257980	5262980	I have a question because we know that for all this, the American space program, I forget what the number is,
5262980	5266980	but it's funny, I think, a lot of people have died in the American space program or something,
5266980	5270980	the two shuttle things and the guys in the beginning of the Apollo.
5270980	5273980	How many Russian cosmonauts died, do you know?
5273980	5274980	I don't know.
5274980	5276980	Does that mean they don't release that?
5276980	5278980	Some fuckers died.
5278980	5280980	I don't know the number.
5280980	5282980	That'd be interesting to find out.
5282980	5284980	It was like 20 some here?
5284980	5288980	Well, I forget the number, but it's like 18 or something like that,
5288980	5291980	around there of Americans that died through our space program.
5291980	5297980	Which is pretty crazy when you think of the amount, there's been something like 160 or 70 or 80 space shuttle missions or something like that.
5297980	5300980	Well, yeah, the amount of people that died making the Golden Gate Bridge.
5300980	5304980	The amount of people that die from poverty.
5304980	5308980	And you'd think flinging us into space would have the highest casualty rate.
5308980	5310980	Again, I'm going to get all the numbers.
5310980	5313980	Yeah, like looking at the moon and being like, let's go there.
5313980	5315980	People are going to die.
5315980	5317980	The cause of a lot of death.
5317980	5319980	I'm going to get all the numbers wrong, so forgive me.
5320980	5323980	I think maybe seven people died in the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge,
5323980	5325980	which was considered an engineering marvel.
5325980	5326980	Sure.
5326980	5330980	The rule of thumb back then was one person dead for every hundred foot of span.
5330980	5334980	That was considered feasible and okay insurance wise and stuff like that.
5334980	5338980	The fact that only seven people died and held 1,300 feet or whatever.
5338980	5340980	Not more than that, way more than that.
5340980	5342980	That was considered like, we did it!
5342980	5346980	We put fuckers on the moon when only three people had died.
5346980	5352980	I hate to be cynical, but it's really expensive to kill an astronaut.
5352980	5354980	It's a lot of training.
5354980	5357980	A poor guy can die making a bridge, and that's what it is.
5357980	5358980	That's my point.
5358980	5360980	That's why I'm over what I'm ranting about.
5360980	5361980	That's a danger of capitalism.
5361980	5364980	The idea that a dollar is worth something is great.
5364980	5366980	It gets all kinds of shit done.
5366980	5370980	But unfucking capped without some rule above it,
5370980	5374980	that a human life is absolutely,
5374980	5377980	not only worth more than anything,
5377980	5380980	but that the president's human life is actually worth,
5380980	5382980	as much as we can wrap our brain around this,
5382980	5385980	the president's human life is worth the exact same amount.
5385980	5389980	It's like the guy whose breath is terrible in the cubicle next to you
5389980	5392980	and the guy that looked creepy outside the 7-Eleven.
5392980	5394980	You don't have to want to be his best friend,
5394980	5398980	but the idea that his human life is actually all equivalent.
5398980	5402980	All we have to do is put that in place over capitalism.
5402980	5403980	Let capitalism run under it.
5403980	5406980	You wouldn't have stuff like that.
5406980	5411980	By the way, Anatoly's wearing the cat shirt from the sexy guy from last week.
5411980	5413980	Anybody else wearing the cat shirt from last week?
5413980	5414980	No, just one.
5414980	5416980	What's the cat shirt story?
5416980	5417980	There was a gentleman named Andrew.
5417980	5418980	Is Andrew here?
5418980	5419980	No.
5419980	5420980	A guy goes last week.
5420980	5421980	We mentioned him.
5421980	5424980	He just goes to different cities trying to get people to wear that shirt.
5424980	5425980	He was in the front row,
5425980	5428980	and he was in a wheelchair with arm brace crutches,
5428980	5429980	and he had that shirt on.
5429980	5431980	So we started talking to him, and he has Tourette's,
5431980	5433980	and he's kind of got a spinal thing for 11 years,
5433980	5434980	and we talked to him,
5434980	5437980	and Aaron fell in love with his cat shirts,
5437980	5439980	and so it's become something of a craze online.
5439980	5440980	Oh, wow. That's cool.
5440980	5441980	We've run rampant.
5441980	5443980	BJ, do you know where we are?
5443980	5444980	Yeah, cat shirts.
5444980	5445980	Okay.
5445980	5447980	It's time to bring Spencer out for sure.
5447980	5448980	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5448980	5449980	Oh, dude.
5449980	5457980	We had a lot of catching up to do.
5457980	5460980	I'm curious to find out on Reddit whether this is the best or worst episode
5460980	5461980	in a while.
5461980	5463980	It's had a lot of stuff.
5463980	5465980	This episode has had everything.
5465980	5471980	But I think, you know, I think that we've settled into an audience
5471980	5475980	where it's like my mom would listen to the Home Shopping Network
5475980	5478980	while she's sewed in the 80s.
5478980	5479980	I would come home from school.
5479980	5481980	My mom wasn't buying anything because we were poor,
5481980	5483980	but she'd sit there and sew stuff,
5483980	5485980	and she would have the Home Shopping Network on
5485980	5487980	because she had grown addicted to the voices.
5488980	5489980	This is the people.
5489980	5492980	Like, oh, Diane, she gives you a toot every time you order a bracelet.
5492980	5494980	You know, she's just listening to Diane talk about.
5494980	5497980	It's like, if you listen to people for hours a day...
5497980	5499980	You think that's what we've been reduced to?
5499980	5501980	That's not reduced elevated to.
5501980	5502980	We're in their homes. We're in their lives.
5502980	5503980	We're their family.
5503980	5506980	If I cut my finger right now, someone in Illinois would be like,
5506980	5508980	oh, he cut his finger.
5508980	5509980	Well, so they are listening.
5509980	5512980	It's not just that they're listening to the sounds that our voices make.
5512980	5513980	Right. No, they're...
5513980	5514980	They're engaged.
5514980	5515980	Yeah.
5515980	5516980	Okay.
5516980	5518980	Hi, Diane in Illinois.
5518980	5520980	Are you chopping your salad?
5520980	5521980	Hey, Gary.
5521980	5523980	Drive safe this morning.
5523980	5524980	All right, Camille.
5524980	5525980	Speed round.
5525980	5527980	You have two B.J. questions left.
5527980	5528980	Oh, shit.
5528980	5529980	That was the first question.
5529980	5530980	Speed round.
5534980	5535980	Hi, Spencer. How are you?
5535980	5536980	Hey, guys.
5536980	5537980	Hey, Spencer.
5537980	5538980	Hi, Spencer.
5538980	5539980	Continue.
5540980	5541980	Do you want to answer the question?
5541980	5542980	No.
5542980	5543980	You don't have to.
5543980	5544980	Continue.
5544980	5545980	You never cry.
5545980	5546980	Do you believe in God?
5546980	5547980	Uh-huh.
5547980	5548980	Yes.
5548980	5549980	And...
5549980	5553980	I also cried during that Home Depot video where the guy is proposing to that other guy.
5553980	5554980	Oh, yeah.
5554980	5555980	Well, I don't know this.
5555980	5556980	I don't know this video.
5556980	5557980	I'm sad.
5557980	5558980	How's it go?
5558980	5559980	He's like...
5564980	5565980	He's demonstrating.
5565980	5566980	I have to come up with you?
5569980	5574980	And then imagine all these people are dancing and you're the guy.
5575980	5576980	Okay?
5576980	5577980	And then...
5577980	5578980	Wait.
5578980	5579980	Now, I should be the guy.
5579980	5581980	You should be the guy who's proposing to me.
5582980	5583980	Wait.
5583980	5584980	You...
5584980	5585980	You did improv?
5591980	5593980	All his friends were like...
5596980	5597980	I'm the guy or the girl?
5597980	5598980	You're a guy.
5598980	5599980	Okay.
5599980	5600980	And I'm another guy.
5600980	5601980	Right.
5601980	5602980	We're in Home Depot.
5602980	5603980	Okay.
5603980	5604980	All of our friends are back here dancing.
5604980	5605980	They're dancing at the Home Depot.
5607980	5611980	And then, like, a bunch of kids walk in with iPads and start pulling them up.
5612980	5617980	So, look, here's someone you know's face chatting you from somewhere else in America or around
5617980	5618980	the world.
5618980	5619980	And you're like, oh, hi, relatives.
5619980	5621980	Yeah, good to see you on the iPad.
5621980	5624980	And then your fiancé guy walks up and is like...
5624980	5626980	You're a fiancé guy who walks up?
5627980	5628980	He's a fascinating American guy.
5628980	5629980	Oh.
5629980	5633980	And you're like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
5633980	5634980	Come on.
5634980	5635980	Come on.
5635980	5636980	Okay.
5639980	5641980	You've made me so happy.
5642980	5647980	Will you make the rest of my life the happiest life that I will ever have?
5649980	5650980	I do.
5656980	5659980	Jim and BJ are both really actually crying.
5660980	5662980	You just gave me your Home Depot card?
5662980	5663980	What is this?
5664980	5665980	BJ, everybody.
5665980	5666980	Thank you, sir.
5668980	5669980	Magic.
5669980	5671980	Let's bring Aaron McGathey up to the stage.
5671980	5672980	Aaron.
5673980	5675980	I got a little cheered up.
5675980	5683980	If I'm interpreting that correctly, it's a viral video of it's a same-sex couple proposal.
5684980	5686980	It certainly wasn't our reenactment.
5687980	5692980	It did make me sad because it felt like a little golden railroad spike.
5693980	5698980	I imagine my mom watching that then and going like, oh, that's how you win.
5699980	5700980	Those are the victories.
5700980	5703980	When my mom goes like, oh, they're just like us.
5704980	5705980	That makes me cry.
5706980	5707980	Seeing the romance.
5707980	5710980	If you could drag your mom to a gay wedding, this issue would be over.
5711980	5713980	Because believe me, they're more romantic than...
5713980	5714980	We've talked about it.
5714980	5715980	Hello, Aaron.
5715980	5716980	Hi.
5719980	5720980	Did you get your hair colored?
5720980	5721980	Is that new hair?
5721980	5722980	Yeah, it's a little too purply.
5722980	5723980	I like it.
5723980	5724980	It looks good.
5724980	5725980	I don't think it's purply.
5725980	5726980	Oh, thank you.
5726980	5727980	It looks good.
5727980	5728980	It worked.
5731980	5733980	I feel like a fool now.
5734980	5736980	Real quick, because we're getting late on time, Aaron.
5736980	5737980	Last time you cried.
5738980	5740980	I mean, I cry all the time.
5741980	5742980	All constantly.
5742980	5748980	The last time I really sobbed was watching the Stella sisters who are on Nashville.
5748980	5749980	Oh, yeah.
5749980	5750980	Yeah.
5750980	5751980	We've talked about this.
5751980	5755980	These two little girls, Lennon and Maisie Stella, they're sisters and they sing acapella.
5755980	5756980	And the way that they look at...
5756980	5758980	If I start talking about it, I'll cry.
5758980	5759980	The way that...
5759980	5760980	Oh, two and three.
5760980	5761980	Okay, little.
5761980	5762980	No, they're not two and three.
5762980	5763980	They're like...
5763980	5764980	Six and ten or somewhere around there.
5764980	5765980	Yeah, eight and ten.
5765980	5769980	They're playing with like two tins of margarine as percussion and they're real.
5769980	5772980	They're probably in their 40s now, but like they've been around.
5772980	5773980	No, not literally.
5773980	5777980	But the way that they look at each other as sisters, the way that they admire each other,
5777980	5779980	makes me sob.
5779980	5781980	But also paintings and...
5782980	5785980	Dan, you want to grab the character sheets and let's get this underway?
5785980	5787980	We have precious little time for Spencer and D&D.
5787980	5789980	Yeah, let's lightening through this D&D.
5789980	5792980	Yeah, we got to catch Christopher up on his recent exploits.
5792980	5794980	Yeah, tell me real quick what happened.
5794980	5796980	Oh, do you do that?
5796980	5799980	I don't really say any Christopher specific things, I don't think.
5799980	5801980	I think you can jump right back in.
5801980	5804980	We have a skeleton army, we put on a big dance routine.
5804980	5805980	I was there for that.
5805980	5806980	Oh, you were there for that.
5806980	5808980	Yeah, I was there for the dance routine.
5808980	5811980	Yeah, so we fought a bunch of blob monsters and googas.
5811980	5813980	I think it's all pretty self-explanatory.
5813980	5814980	All right, Spencer.
5815980	5816980	What?
5817980	5818980	Take it away.
5818980	5819980	Oh.
5820980	5821980	Okay.
5821980	5823980	You have a ribbon knife now.
5823980	5824980	Do you know about that?
5824980	5825980	I mean...
5825980	5826980	What?
5826980	5828980	You have a knife that already...
5828980	5830980	You guys!
5830980	5833980	You never have to tie a rope to your dagger again.
5833980	5834980	No!
5834980	5837980	I have a new story for the last time I cried.
5844980	5845980	Oh, okay.
5846980	5853980	On the last episode of Harment Town, our heroes were still in the depths of Admiral Darkstar's Black King.
5853980	5857980	After trekking north to lay a final siege on the menacing Marauder,
5857980	5862980	our heroes fell prey to Darkstar's illusionary defenses and were trapped within its icy clutches.
5862980	5866980	After reuniting, the party defeated a snowflake imp,
5866980	5868980	and then charged up some stairs,
5868980	5872980	encountering a porcupine demon in front of a room full of buttons.
5872980	5876980	After dispatching the hellish hedgehog, our heroes set to work,
5876980	5879980	pressing buttons and releasing terribly dangerous fluids
5879980	5886980	until they stumbled across one that unleashed the 23 flavors of refreshing satisfaction that is Dr. Pepper.
5888980	5893980	Filling the room with Dr. Pepper, our heroes floated up towards a hole in the steelid ceiling,
5893980	5900980	in the sticky effervescent embrace of success and the taste that Amazon site reviews call great tasting.
5901980	5906980	The party crawled out of the hole and onto the floor of a great hall in a great metal castle.
5906980	5909980	They were in the Black Keep.
5909980	5912980	But what would they do? I don't know.
5913980	5915980	Thank you, Spencer.
5917980	5921980	Spencer Clinton, as always, brought to you by Dr. Pepper.
5922980	5925980	100% immersion. I'm just calling it out.
5925980	5926980	Okay.
5926980	5930980	Yeah, so you guys crawl into the hall of the Dark Keep.
5930980	5935980	After you exit from this hole, you feel the nurturing Dr. Pepper has healed you.
5935980	5938980	You regain all your lost hit points.
5938980	5940980	Okay. All right.
5941980	5943980	Wow, I feel so refreshed.
5944980	5945980	Me too.
5946980	5948980	I'm more of a Mr. Pimp guy.
5950980	5951980	It's Pimp extra now.
5951980	5952980	Oh, is it?
5952980	5953980	Yeah.
5956980	5962980	You guys and Gal, we finally made it. This is the Dark Keep. This is the stronghold of Admiral Darkstar.
5963980	5966980	It's quiet. Too quiet.
5968980	5969980	Scared.
5969980	5971980	I cast light.
5971980	5974980	It lights up. Wait, what do you cast it on?
5975980	5976980	My finger.
5976980	5977980	Okay.
5978980	5979980	It lights up.
5981980	5983980	Are you holding it to try and look around?
5983980	5984980	Yeah.
5984980	5985980	Okay.
5985980	5987980	Examine my surroundings.
5987980	5993980	You can see there's a large double door to what I'm going to call, for sake of reference, the south of this room.
5993980	5998980	You also see a wooden door on the east and on the west, and there's a staircase leading from the north.
5998980	6001980	You just crawled out of a hole roughly in the center.
6001980	6006980	Out of the same hole, you see your skeletons that you've been, you know, amassing.
6006980	6011980	They float to the top, and they start to pull themselves out of the Dr. Pepper.
6011980	6013980	Do we still have all 50 of our skeletons?
6014980	6016980	Would you like to count them?
6016980	6017980	I count skeletons.
6017980	6019980	You only count 46 somehow.
6019980	6020980	Okay.
6021980	6022980	You know, you're going to make an omelet.
6022980	6023980	Yep.
6024980	6025980	Recount.
6026980	6027980	46.
6028980	6029980	Okay.
6029980	6030980	I'm sorry, I doubted you.
6030980	6031980	That's okay.
6032980	6034980	I was hoping you were wrong. I didn't want to think.
6034980	6037980	Yeah, what happened? We lost Hughie, Louie, and Scrooge.
6040980	6045980	Fellas, that staircase, I guess, should be the first thing we go, we check out.
6045980	6048980	But behind you, you hear the double doors flying open.
6048980	6049980	Whoa!
6049980	6051980	Out charges a well-armored warrior.
6051980	6054980	His breastplate is dazzling gold, and he wears a great green cape,
6054980	6057980	and clutches a blue gem on a rope in one hand.
6057980	6060980	Speaketh your name and intention, I am Lightfinger.
6063980	6065980	That's not true. My name's Sharpie.
6065980	6067980	I don't want to start a relationship with a lie.
6069980	6072980	As he dashes in the room and looks at your glowing finger, he says,
6072980	6077980	Asmodeus is piss ant demons, leave now or die where you stand.
6077980	6080980	You have us wrong, you have us wrong, my friend.
6080980	6082980	None of us are piss ants.
6082980	6087980	My finger is only illuminated from the power of truth.
6087980	6092980	The devil's illusions work great tricks on my mind.
6092980	6096980	Hey, look into my eyes. Do you see a devil's illusion right now?
6096980	6097980	Yes.
6097980	6101980	Okay, look into my eyes. Do you see a devil's illusion now?
6102980	6103980	Not as much.
6103980	6106980	Oh, okay. All right, warp.
6106980	6109980	We go down the circle, we go down the line.
6109980	6112980	I mean, it's still about the same.
6112980	6114980	Okay, what does his face look like?
6114980	6117980	He looks, it's gleaming and bright.
6117980	6122980	He has like a plus sign that's just glowing on his face. It's weird.
6122980	6127980	Listen, how many people have you encountered since your travels here
6127980	6130980	that have told you that they're here to destroy Admiral Darkstar?
6130980	6133980	The last room was full of people such as that.
6133980	6134980	And they turned on you?
6134980	6136980	And I destroyed them.
6136980	6140980	Okay. Did you really check your math before you destroyed him?
6140980	6146980	You're in the black heap of Admiral Darkstar. That makes you one of his dark minions.
6146980	6149980	Yeah, but it hasn't turned out to be that deceptive a place.
6149980	6153980	It's sort of like, hey, I'm in an ice pit. Oh, I'm in a soda room.
6153980	6157980	We haven't encountered a lot of like, holy shit, it's my uncle. No, it's not.
6158980	6160980	That's your experience, man.
6163980	6167980	But yours has been one of like, holy shit, like a hall of psychological mirrors.
6167980	6170980	Like you've been running into people that seem like they're cool and then turn out they're not?
6170980	6174980	Yes, and this seems like it's the third in a three trial set.
6174980	6175980	No.
6175980	6178980	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6178980	6181980	Are you here, sir, to kill Admiral Darkstar, too?
6181980	6183980	That's why I came to the north.
6183980	6184980	Okay, yeah. Team up with this.
6184980	6189980	Ask us questions, and our answers will prove that we're not the demons.
6189980	6193980	May I speak on behalf of my friend? We love tying ropes to things.
6193980	6196980	How does your gem rope thing work?
6196980	6197980	It looks really cool.
6197980	6199980	Yeah, it looks really, really cool.
6199980	6203980	By the way, I've been thinking about getting one of those plus signs on my head, so...
6203980	6205980	That's the mark of my god.
6205980	6207980	Wait, what's your name?
6207980	6211980	My name is Callus the Magnificent.
6211980	6213980	Oh, appropriate name, sir.
6213980	6215980	Yeah, yeah.
6215980	6216980	Callus?
6216980	6217980	That doesn't bother me.
6217980	6218980	Callus?
6218980	6220980	How many demons have done this?
6220980	6225980	And I get on my knees, and I open my throat to you, sir.
6225980	6226980	Strike me down.
6226980	6227980	Got it.
6227980	6228980	Okay.
6230980	6232980	Can we have a side bar, Sharpie?
6232980	6234980	No, that's what demons do.
6234980	6241980	We owe this guy proof that we're not demons because he's had two encounters with demons.
6241980	6246980	So now everyone in the world has to bend over backwards for him.
6246980	6250980	Well, fine, fucking cut my head off, or let's move on.
6250980	6253980	Can I just do a sense motive on Callus?
6253980	6254980	I mean, sure.
6254980	6256980	Okay, I just try to sense motive on him.
6256980	6260980	His motive is to defeat all the demons and dark stars reign.
6260980	6262980	So he's a good guy.
6262980	6263980	Just as far as I can tell.
6263980	6265980	I'm still doing it. I'm waiting.
6265980	6268980	Time is money, Callus.
6268980	6269980	This is a good point.
6269980	6272980	I don't think any demons have done this before.
6272980	6273980	Jesus Christ.
6273980	6277980	I get up and dust myself off in that really aggressive way.
6279980	6280980	Fucking A.
6280980	6288980	And I walk past him through the doors, and I mutter as I trail off as I fucking people.
6288980	6289980	Halt.
6289980	6290980	Hey, I'm sorry for my friend.
6290980	6291980	Excuse me, what?
6291980	6295980	Just because you aren't demons doesn't mean that you're good people.
6295980	6297980	I was just thinking the same thing about you.
6297980	6298980	Yeah.
6298980	6303980	As a paladin, it is my job to wipe out all evil, not just demons.
6303980	6304980	A paladin.
6304980	6307980	You customers seem pretty rough.
6307980	6308980	Yeah.
6308980	6309980	No, we're good guys.
6309980	6320980	I use my diplomacy, and I look into his eyes, and I take out my rope, and I tie it to my bedroll.
6321980	6330980	And I look to my pals and give them a, like, it's going to be fine.
6330980	6332980	I look confused.
6332980	6334980	We give her the look.
6334980	6338980	We normally give her when she gets out one of her arts and crafts.
6339980	6343980	I'm sorry to the guy.
6345980	6347980	Tell us the magnificence.
6347980	6352980	I look at him and use my diplomacy, and he goes, hmm, see, we're not that tough.
6352980	6355980	I've known better than to take a trapped item before.
6355980	6363980	Oh, no, I use my diplomacy, and I say, Kalis, I offer you this bedroll and rope representing
6363980	6371980	the tie to our home that we are making vulnerable.
6371980	6375980	Can I say, if we weren't good, would we put up with this shit?
6378980	6383980	Yeah, I guess you're right.
6384980	6386980	Well, then let's team up and work together.
6386980	6387980	You seem like a tough paladin.
6387980	6389980	Let's go and do this thing.
6389980	6390980	Okay.
6390980	6391980	All right.
6391980	6393980	Also, just one thing, though.
6393980	6394980	No, no, no.
6394980	6395980	No, no, no.
6395980	6396980	Sharpie.
6396980	6397980	Sharpie.
6397980	6398980	Leave it.
6398980	6399980	Sharpie.
6399980	6400980	Leave it.
6400980	6401980	We're all on the same page, Sharpie.
6401980	6403980	Let it go.
6408980	6411980	Last time you went on one of these, you got stepped on by a giant.
6411980	6413980	Ah, the healing choir of...
6414980	6416980	That's not immersion.
6416980	6417980	All right, all right.
6417980	6418980	Yeah, exactly.
6418980	6419980	I'm immersed.
6419980	6420980	Just saying, the guy's...
6420980	6421980	Sharpie.
6421980	6422980	Oh, it's pretty picky.
6422980	6423980	Cool.
6423980	6424980	All right, guy that's alone.
6424980	6425980	All right.
6426980	6430980	He wants to fight the demons, but he wants to find the best allies in the world.
6430980	6434980	Tell us, why do you want to defeat Admiral Darkstar?
6434980	6437980	Because the shard of truth tells me so.
6438980	6439980	Fair enough?
6439980	6440980	Yeah.
6440980	6441980	Okay, cool.
6441980	6449980	All right, so where are you coming from besides two encounters that bit your mind?
6449980	6450980	We don't need...
6450980	6451980	He doesn't need sass.
6451980	6452980	Let's not sass him.
6452980	6453980	I'm not sassing him.
6453980	6455980	I feel like you're sassing him a little bit.
6455980	6456980	All right, look.
6456980	6457980	I'm just...
6457980	6458980	I've had a...
6458980	6459980	Swam and Cola.
6459980	6460980	No, dude.
6460980	6461980	I'm with...
6461980	6462980	Sharpie, I'm with you.
6462980	6463980	I understand.
6463980	6465980	But this guy, he doesn't know where we're coming from.
6465980	6470820	You know, let's just put our best face forward, and then once he trusts us, then we can have
6470820	6471820	the talk with him.
6471820	6474980	Hey, like, you come across a little weird right up top.
6475980	6478980	What did you see in your travels?
6478980	6479980	Callous.
6479980	6480980	What?
6480980	6481980	I always...
6481980	6483980	I sat him on the back of him to say, thanks.
6483980	6485980	I don't see how that's relevant.
6485980	6486980	Oh, my God.
6486980	6487980	What is...
6487980	6488980	Where is it?
6488980	6489980	Listen, he's a dick.
6489980	6490980	He's a total dick.
6490980	6493980	Tell me, tell me, you guys.
6493980	6495980	Why do you control a skeleton army?
6495980	6497980	I'm pretty sure, not pretty sure.
6497980	6502980	I know for a fact that skeletons cannot be created without great evil being done.
6502980	6507980	We made a deal with a frost giant who said that, you know, we could team up.
6507980	6508980	He didn't really help us a lot.
6508980	6509980	He tried to kill us all.
6509980	6511980	You've contracted with a dark force.
6511980	6512980	Nope.
6512980	6513980	He's not a dark force.
6513980	6514980	Have you been to Fortnheim?
6514980	6515980	No, you can't.
6515980	6517980	The frozen city?
6517980	6520980	I've heard tell of such a city.
6520980	6524980	They're not great people either, but they're not dark.
6524980	6525980	Yeah.
6525980	6526980	They killed him, but then they brought him...
6526980	6527980	We did a bus.
6527980	6528980	We broke a musical.
6528980	6529980	It's a whole thing.
6529980	6530980	You don't need to get into it.
6530980	6531980	I go over and accept that.
6531980	6532980	You are undead?
6532980	6534980	Oh, our skeletons are.
6534980	6535980	No, listen.
6535980	6536980	It came out wrong.
6536980	6537980	He's...
6537980	6541980	No, yes, our skeletons are undead to doy.
6541980	6543980	They're skeletons, and they're moving around.
6543980	6545980	Your compatriot said you were once dead.
6545980	6546980	Okay.
6546980	6547980	I was wrong.
6547980	6548980	He was dying.
6548980	6549980	He was dying.
6549980	6550980	He was so almost dead.
6550980	6552980	I'm dead inside.
6552980	6555980	I had a dad like you.
6555980	6556980	Okay.
6556980	6557980	Sharpie.
6557980	6558980	That's Sharpie.
6558980	6559980	Leave it.
6559980	6560980	We don't...
6560980	6561980	Who is a great man?
6561980	6562980	I'm not looking at him.
6562980	6563980	I'm not looking at him.
6563980	6566980	I walk over and examine the eastern door.
6566980	6568980	The eastern door.
6568980	6571980	You go over to the examine the eastern door, and he's like,
6571980	6573980	I wouldn't go there.
6573980	6575980	Okay, let's take the sword for us.
6575980	6576980	Right?
6576980	6578980	So what do you know about the eastern door, Callus?
6578980	6581980	Oh, demons roast on the east.
6581980	6583980	Well, if they're roasting, that's good.
6583980	6584980	Well, I mean they're eating.
6584980	6585980	Oh, okay.
6585980	6587980	I thought they were being roasted.
6587980	6589980	No, no, they do the roasting.
6589980	6592980	So the objective, Callus, is to go to the demon-less door?
6592980	6593980	I don't know.
6593980	6596980	Which doors have you been to so far?
6596980	6598980	Which area have you not explored?
6598980	6599980	I just know the east.
6599980	6601980	I go to the southern door.
6601980	6603980	That's where I came out of.
6603980	6604980	All right, Jesus.
6604980	6605980	You just said you've only...
6605980	6606980	Hey, listen.
6606980	6607980	No, the western door is here.
6607980	6608980	Listen.
6608980	6610980	I'm on your side, no Sharpie.
6610980	6611980	No, no, no.
6611980	6614980	This alliance is uneasy right now, let's wait.
6614980	6618980	I do a big sarcastic chiptoe over to the northern door.
6618980	6621980	Like, is this okay?
6621980	6623980	And then I laugh to him.
6623980	6627980	That is so funny.
6627980	6629980	He does a respond.
6629980	6633980	Okay, I examine, I do like a perception check on that door.
6633980	6635980	There's a large handle.
6635980	6637980	I try the handle.
6637980	6641980	You try the handle, and as you grab it, you feel a shirt prick.
6641980	6647980	You pull your hand away and you see a needle is poked out of the door and stabbed you in the hand.
6647980	6648980	Why didn't...
6648980	6649980	Retracting in the door.
6649980	6650980	Uh-oh.
6650980	6653980	This perception check should have showed you that there was like a needle on it.
6653980	6654980	It just showed me there was a handle.
6654980	6655980	It didn't show me anything else.
6655980	6657980	Yeah, it just popped out recently.
6657980	6658980	Am I cut?
6658980	6659980	Oh, yeah.
6659980	6660980	Uh-oh.
6660980	6661980	Are you talking about the northern door or the western door?
6661980	6662980	The northern door.
6662980	6663980	The northern door.
6663980	6665980	What's your fortitude saved there?
6665980	6669980	My fortitude is eight.
6669980	6671980	All right.
6671980	6673980	Everything's fine.
6673980	6679980	Hey, guys, this door has a needle on it, but I feel like I dodged a bullet on this one.
6679980	6682980	Can I go grab it but not where the needle comes out of?
6682980	6684980	Like, the different part of the handle?
6684980	6685980	Sure.
6685980	6687980	Because it's clearly an important door if it's protected by a needle.
6687980	6688980	Right.
6688980	6692980	So I grab the other part of it and I open it.
6692980	6693980	Okay.
6693980	6696980	You see stairs that go up.
6696980	6699980	Guys, do you want to go up some stairs?
6699980	6700980	Yeah.
6700980	6702980	What do you think, Callous?
6702980	6704980	I think I'm going through the other door.
6704980	6705980	Which door is that?
6705980	6706980	What door?
6706980	6707980	You know what, Callous?
6707980	6708980	The west.
6708980	6709980	The west.
6709980	6710980	You're going through the west door.
6710980	6711980	Yeah.
6711980	6712980	I'm going there now.
6712980	6713980	Why?
6713980	6714980	Why?
6714980	6715980	Because you guys don't know what you're doing.
6715980	6716980	Oh, do you?
6716980	6717980	Yeah.
6717980	6718980	I'm sorry.
6718980	6719980	Well, can we beat your minions?
6719980	6721980	He starts stomping towards this western door.
6721980	6727980	I stomp after him, but I imitate his stomping.
6727980	6729980	He throws open the door.
6729980	6730980	Is there a needle on it?
6730980	6733980	Inside is nothing but darkness.
6733980	6734980	Yeah.
6734980	6736980	Good choice, Callous.
6736980	6737980	Tasty pick.
6737980	6738980	He stops.
6738980	6742980	He gulps a bit and he's like, you guys suck.
6742980	6745980	You don't know what's up.
6745980	6750980	I'm going through this door and you guys can't come.
6750980	6751980	What?
6751980	6752980	We can't come.
6752980	6754980	He charges through the door and slams it shut.
6754980	6755980	All right.
6755980	6756980	You know what?
6756980	6758980	I think that was Admiral Darkstar in disguise.
6758980	6760980	I don't trust this guy at all.
6760980	6761980	Oh, shit.
6761980	6763980	You hear blood curdling screams.
6763980	6764980	No.
6764980	6765980	It was just he's a redshirt.
6765980	6766980	Yeah.
6766980	6767980	Oh, no.
6767980	6768980	Sorry.
6768980	6769980	I'm metagaming, metagaming.
6769980	6771980	Let's go up the stairs of the other door, the northern door.
6771980	6776980	You begin heading up the stairs, but they seem longer than intended, as if it might
6776980	6779980	take a whole week to find Tom.
6779980	6780980	Cliffhanger!
6780980	6781980	All right.
6781980	6787980	Thank you, everybody, for coming to Harbontown once again.
6787980	6790980	What a journey we went on.
6790980	6796980	I'd like to thank Jay Pudome and John Roy.
6797980	6798980	B.J., of course.
6798980	6801980	Everybody, our cast of cavalcade of characters.
6801980	6806980	Erin McGathey, Spencer Crittenden, Kamayo Nanjiani, everybody.
6806980	6808980	I'm Jeff Davis, our Comptroller.
6808980	6817980	One more time for the mayor, Dan Harmon.
6817980	6820980	We walked up a whole staircase.
6820980	6821980	See you guys next week.
6826980	6827980	Bye.
6827980	6827980
