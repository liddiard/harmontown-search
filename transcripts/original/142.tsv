0	19000	To note that product from Hollywood, California, Carmen's town is now in session.
19000	24000	Happy Easter.
25000	28000	Happy Easter.
28000	33000	Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Hermit Town, Mr. Dan!
33000	36000	From the ears of Hermit.
39000	42000	Thank you. Happy Easter.
44000	46000	Wow.
46000	49000	What's the thing for Thanksgiving?
49000	51000	It's about what you're thankful for.
51000	58000	You're thankful for an Easter, is it like what you're relieved about?
58000	63000	In keeping with the Christian tradition of like, whoo!
63000	65000	He's up.
65000	70000	It's a spring ceremony about that things are back in bloom.
70000	73000	That Jesus is back in bloom.
73000	76000	He's blossoming like a little flower.
76000	79000	He's ready to pollinate.
80000	83000	With his Christ pollen.
85000	89000	I think that's a pretty uplifting thing, isn't it?
89000	95000	You're reminding me right now of a movie I don't like, and I know that people here love it, Donnie Darko.
95000	104000	I don't like Donnie Darko, and you're reminding me of the terrible nightmare rabbit from Donnie Darko.
104000	118000	Well, okay, so I have ears on like that costume, so you're saying the rest of my face and body are like a blood-soaked, dirt-coated, creepy rabbit costume.
118000	120000	Precisely.
120000	126000	So when I'm not wearing the ears, you just think I'm like a creepy, gross, furry, bloody...
126000	129000	I think you're a lazy Donnie Darko.
129000	133000	I don't think the rabbit's name is Donnie Darko.
133000	138000	I don't think your hatred of the movie is valid if you don't know that.
138000	140000	But check this out, look.
145000	152000	You showing me a slightly off-center cottontail on your ass is not going to stop me from having more nightmares.
153000	163000	But of course, you know, our audience is filled with jaded hipsters, so they already know that Easter is, of course.
163000	167000	Are the hipsters... What is a hipster, by the way? What is your definition of hipster?
167000	175000	A hipster is any person that you are projecting a bunch of your insecurities onto.
177000	181000	Couldn't those also be jocks and also be hippies?
181000	187000	Yeah, I don't think that there's people who present as jocks anymore in the millennium.
187000	192000	So everyone just calls everybody a hipster that they don't like. In Los Angeles, anyway.
192000	197000	I'm sure there's archetypes in the Midwest still that you could go like, that guy's a fucking tractor.
197000	202000	Dan, look out in our audience. Look out and physically make eye contact.
202000	205000	Find what you would think of as a hipster.
205000	207000	Yeah, they're all hipsters.
207000	212000	If there was a giant stand-up comic that came up here, he would call them all hipsters.
212000	217000	I've been through this situation. Channel 101 kids were called hipsters at this open mic
217000	221000	because they came to see me do stand-up instead of this other guy, and this other guy called them all hipsters.
221000	224000	And it was like, we're nerds, fucking hipster.
225000	229000	I think we have 100% nerds, no hipsters.
229000	236000	What I don't see is hipsters wearing ironic, weird scarves for no reason.
237000	243000	For instance, there's a razor, razor-fine line between nerd girl and hipster.
243000	250000	If you're a nerd girl, how do you distinguish if you're a guy and you see a nerdy girl?
250000	255000	I would say there's a very definable line between nerd, girl, and nerd.
255000	259000	It depends if her glasses are actually prescription, or if that's what it is.
260000	266000	If she takes off the glasses, then walks into a wall, then she would say, okay, gotcha, she's a nerd.
266000	269000	Just take our front row.
269000	273000	Find a hipster in our front row, or admit they're all nerds.
273000	277000	We've got Lena Dunham here, and she's definitely a hipster.
277000	282000	Will you stand up and wave to everybody? You're the ultimate hipster. Lena Dunham, everybody.
284000	286000	She's a nerd!
286000	288000	Is that a nerd?
288000	291000	No, right, she's a nerd, yes, that was very nerdy behavior, thank you.
291000	294000	Where's this going? What's your end game?
294000	297000	I don't think there's hipsters here. I think we've all...
297000	304000	Harmontown, we never really went to the moon, because we gave up on that premise a fucking good long time ago.
304000	309000	What we did do is we went to the moon of no hipsters, just nerds. Right?
309000	311000	Yeah, I mean, you're pretty drunk.
312000	317000	He said, nervously adjusting his bunny ears.
318000	324000	I mean, it's Easter, Jeff said, are we doing a show on Easter? I said, yeah, sorry about that, and my assistant's Jewish.
324000	328000	And Jeff said, well, I'll come, but I'm going to be pretty drunk.
328000	335000	Actually, I'm not as drunk as I would like to be. I drink a lot of rose Greek wine at Dino's, but I'm not as drunk as I wish I were.
335000	340000	No. I think that's in the eye of the beholder.
341000	350000	Anyways, I think Easter is, of course, based on the absorption of the solstice, the...
350000	354000	What does Easter mean for you? I've internalized Easter.
354000	360000	It's spring. It's coming out of winter and into the time when the winter thaw and stuff.
360000	366000	For my family, growing up as a Lutheran kid in Wisconsin, it was...
366000	371000	You know, we would dye the eggs and then we would hide the actual hard-boiled eggs.
371000	376000	I found out that's not as common a thing. A lot of people hide the plastic eggs filled with candy.
376000	380000	Makes more sense. Like, what kid wants to find a hard-boiled egg?
380000	383000	I did. I was like, ah, I can't wait to find all the eggs.
383000	389000	You and I are about the same age. It was always hard-boiled eggs. There were no fake eggs filled with candy.
389000	391000	You found a hard-boiled egg.
391000	394000	But why? Why did you want to find them?
394000	397000	Because it was Easter.
397000	403000	I also associate Easter with, like, my clearest memory about Easter is, unfortunately for my mom.
403000	407000	Like, I remember waking up with my brother and walking into the living room,
407000	412000	and there was this piece of typewriter paper with Sharpie Pen Note written on it that said,
412000	416000	Easter has been postponed.
416000	420000	I think because somebody misbehaved the previous day, there was a big family fight or something.
420000	424000	So we woke up and we were like, what the fuck does postponed mean?
424000	428000	And my brother was like, I think it means cancelled. I was like, I think it means delayed.
428000	431000	I think we're going to have an Easter later.
431000	437000	And then we had to force ourselves to go like, well, do we like Easter? Do we care if it ever arrives?
437000	441000	Isn't the whole point of Easter that Jesus delayed it for three days before he...
441000	445000	Yeah, a good Easter is always postponed.
445000	447000	Yes. Yes.
447000	448000	How ironic.
448000	450000	Jesus can't be on time.
450000	452000	Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
452000	458000	It's like somebody ruining Christmas by giving birth.
458000	461000	To Jesus.
461000	463000	That's the only way to ruin it.
463000	467000	Or like if you're like, oh, Christmas is ruined because there's no room in this hotel.
467000	468000	You know?
468000	471000	Well, there's so much room. Fuck it.
477000	486000	Why would you stay in a barn? There's room at the hotel.
486000	488000	All right. So I...
488000	490000	All right.
490000	493000	Let's see what we got here. I don't think a lot.
493000	496000	Let me know in the booth if our special guest shows up.
496000	500000	We have a guest? Also, don't tell me who it is. I don't know that.
500000	504000	All right. Okay.
504000	510000	Dan? Special secret? I'm a little drunk.
510000	515000	Oh, so to go back to my thing, it's Easter, so what are you relieved about?
515000	516000	Why is it about relief?
516000	521000	Because when the people saw Jesus come out of the cave, I'm sure they're like, whew.
521000	525000	No, I don't think it's relief. I think it's a crisis.
525000	527000	Well, maybe for a few...
527000	530000	For the Romans and the Jews and everyone else.
530000	532000	What does this mean? It's a moment of crisis.
532000	535000	I don't think we celebrate Easter through the eyes of the Romans.
535000	540000	No. We celebrate against the backdrop of the Romans.
540000	542000	The idea that...
542000	546000	Oh, we fucking... We helped a guy get killed, and then he's now...
546000	550000	Where the fuck is he?
550000	554000	We have to take on the word of a few people that he's...
554000	559000	He's risen. He actually rose from the dead.
560000	563000	Relief is not what's happening then.
563000	567000	It's fucking... It's like, what the fuck is happening right now?
567000	573000	For the followers of Jesus, I don't think they felt relief.
573000	574000	What do you think...
574000	575000	Oh, shit!
575000	576000	Well, what is that?
576000	579000	They killed our friend. Now he's gone. Now he's alive.
579000	582000	So surprise, pleasant surprise.
582000	585000	I don't think they said, oh, what a pleasure.
586000	591000	So on Easter, you should ask yourself, what are you pleasantly surprised by?
594000	598000	I'm presently surprised by you wearing bunny ears.
599000	604000	Also, I'm presently surprised by the fact that this is a holiday that absolutely means nothing,
604000	611000	including people that believe in the New Testament, the Old Testament, and any testament.
612000	618000	It's simply a spring ritual. That's all it is?
618000	623000	Well, isn't that kind of uplifting that even the Holy Roman Empire, with all of its power,
623000	625000	had to... They're like, you know what?
625000	632000	We can rule by force with a lot of ways, but we can't keep these people on these equinoxes,
632000	637000	these solstices. We can't keep them from knowing that the eggs are important.
638000	642000	And so we've got to just move Jesus' various thresholds.
642000	651000	The Roman Empire, I think about three or four hundred years before Caesar ruined the Republic.
652000	657000	The Gauls, which is basically France, a bunch of barbarians, they called them, came in
657000	663000	and took over and kicked a bunch of ass in Italy and went right to the gates of Rome.
664000	672000	The geese flew off in the sky, and Romans worshipped the geese for hundreds of years after that,
672000	678000	because the geese went honk, honk, honk, honk, honk, and warned Rome that the fucking Gauls were at the gates.
678000	683000	And they hated dogs, because the dogs didn't burk!
683000	690000	So for a couple hundred years, for a couple hundred years, then, there was a ritual.
690000	696000	There was a ritual in Rome, while Caesar was in Gaul, and while fucking Pompeii and Caesar,
696000	701000	and a lot of fucking Cato and Cicero, and people we know were there.
705000	707000	Because Cato?
707000	711000	C-A-T-O. Not Cato, Calum.
711000	714000	You said people we know.
715000	720000	There was a ritual held where dogs were murdered in the streets of Rome,
720000	724000	and geese got to sit on golden pillows and watch it happen.
724000	731000	So that's the backdrop of where Easter fucking happens, because it was only about fucking 50 years later
731000	735000	that Jesus was killed, or was around and was dead.
735000	740000	Isn't it crazy that it wasn't too long ago when animals were competitors to us?
740000	745000	We were still on the same pop chart with them.
745000	749000	We were living in cities, but there was still in the back of our heads
749000	753000	there was a threat that maybe we'd be living in bear town one day.
753000	755000	They were like, better make the wall a little higher.
755000	758000	Those fucking bears are getting, they've got a look in their eyes.
758000	762000	Rome was wolf town, so it's two wolves, the fucking founder of the goddamn thing, right?
762000	766000	Yeah, well, Athens was just like a rocky crevice.
766000	770000	It was just like people crawled up into some holes to get away from all the animals.
770000	772000	Then they built the Acropolis on that.
772000	777000	The whole foundation of Western civilization is just based on us being scared of animals
777000	781000	and wondering why they're so much smarter than us.
781000	784000	Why do they always know what to do?
784000	789000	Goddamn it, every time we try to hunt something, the dogs get there first.
789000	795000	It's a really uplifting story that we ended up having them as pets and stuff.
795000	800000	It's sad that we at one point were so ticked off at them
800000	804000	and kind of still insecure that we had to slaughter them and stuff.
804000	806000	It's a little sad.
806000	813000	All right, so anyways, oh, can we do a new segment called My Wife Bullies Me?
813000	818000	Yes, we can.
819000	826000	When you get married, it's time to get picked on by your wife
826000	829000	for the rest of your life.
829000	836000	She can make fun of you, because it would be hard for you to get up and leave.
836000	843000	Because all your shit is there, and you promised in front of God and her dad that you'd stay.
849000	857000	So as an Easter, Erin was coordinating things with Hoppytown, our Easter mascot at Hoppytown.
857000	860000	I think you guys met up front.
860000	867000	She came down to visit me, and I was having a nice Easter with the Easter basket she made for me
867000	871000	with all kinds of Reese's products in it.
872000	880000	I had put on a selection of music in a really roundabout way.
880000	883000	We call them chain zingers.
883000	891000	A chain zinger is if somebody is taking your french fries off of your plate while you're eating,
891000	894000	and then you go, instead of just saying, hey, you're taking all my fries,
894000	897000	you go, so where are you going to deposit it?
897000	900000	And then the other person goes, deposit what?
900000	904000	And you go, all your money, don't you have a bunch of extra money now?
904000	906000	And they go, what do you mean?
906000	910000	And they go, well, because you're getting so rich now, aren't you?
910000	914000	Because you're saving so much money on blood pressure medication?
914000	916000	No, what are you talking about?
916000	919000	Well, don't you have really low blood pressure?
919000	921000	I don't think so.
921000	926000	Well, then how come your sodium intake just seems to be so high?
926000	927000	What are you talking about?
927000	932000	You're eating my fucking fries!
932000	935000	That's a chain zinger.
935000	937000	So she came down and did a chain zinger.
937000	939000	I'm not going to try to recreate it.
939000	942000	I want to hear more chain zingers.
942000	945000	They're not easy, and they become a thing unto themselves.
945000	948000	Just try it with your loved ones at home.
948000	951000	So the person zinging you is doing a chain...
951000	954000	They start eight steps back, and they make you go, what do you mean?
954000	958000	Like eight times, and then they insult you.
958000	959000	Okay.
959000	964000	So she did one of those, and I'm not going to bother to recreate her chain zinger, but it just...
964000	965000	I wish it would.
965000	974000	Because of the music I was listening to, she called me a gay drug dealer.
974000	978000	Wait, is that how she opened up the chain zing, or is that the payoff of the chain zing?
978000	981000	No, that's not how she opened up the chain zing.
981000	983000	I'm still confused about what a chain zinger is.
983000	988000	Well, I shouldn't have distracted you with that, but I didn't want to undersell her bullying of me.
988000	990000	It's very sophisticated.
990000	992000	I don't remember what her chains are.
992000	993000	Her chains are a little sloppy.
993000	995000	I don't want to try to recreate them.
995000	997000	They're lame half the time.
997000	999000	Do you chain zing her?
999000	1000000	Yeah, I do.
1000000	1003000	So what would be you chain zinging, Aaron?
1003000	1004000	You know, I don't know.
1004000	1005000	They're hard.
1005000	1006000	They're hard to do.
1006000	1007000	All right.
1007000	1011000	Well, you're asking us to buy a premise that I don't quite understand right now.
1011000	1016000	I'm asking you to buy a cup of coffee.
1016000	1020000	So my wife...
1020000	1026000	This episode can't be called chain zinger until you tell me what a fucking chain zing really is.
1026000	1029000	What's the meat and potatoes of a chain zinger?
1029000	1030000	All right, all right.
1030000	1032000	Jeff.
1032000	1033000	Jeff, are they...
1033000	1036000	Try and chain zing me on what I'm doing right now.
1036000	1037000	Okay.
1037000	1039000	Jeff, are they removable?
1039000	1040000	What?
1040000	1042000	The tattoos.
1042000	1043000	Which tattoos are you talking about?
1043000	1046000	The ones that you get in prison.
1046000	1047000	The ones I got in prison?
1047000	1048000	Yeah.
1048000	1049000	Didn't you go to prison?
1049000	1051000	I've never been to prison.
1051000	1056000	But what happened after you hit that tree?
1056000	1058000	Which tree?
1058000	1060000	The one that you hit in your car.
1060000	1061000	I didn't hit a tree.
1061000	1062000	What?
1062000	1063000	Aren't you an alcoholic?
1063000	1065000	No.
1065000	1069000	Wait, this tree...
1069000	1071000	I tried to back into...
1071000	1074000	I don't want to do a chain zinger on command.
1074000	1075000	They're hard.
1075000	1076000	They're hard.
1076000	1077000	What's a...
1077000	1078000	I want to know what a fucking chain zinger is.
1078000	1079000	I just tried one.
1079000	1081000	It was bad, but I did one.
1081000	1083000	Give me a fucking historical chain zinger.
1083000	1086000	No, I don't keep track of them.
1086000	1090000	But you're grinding an axe about chain zinging.
1090000	1095000	All right, all right, all right, okay.
1095000	1098000	We're not leaving this room until I fucking know what a chain zinger is.
1098000	1100000	All right.
1100000	1105000	Is it hard for you to...
1105000	1107000	Do your eyes hurt?
1107000	1108000	Do your eyes hurt?
1108000	1109000	Currently?
1109000	1110000	Yeah.
1110000	1111000	No.
1111000	1115000	Okay, but doesn't all the flash photography hurt your eyes?
1115000	1116000	When?
1116000	1118000	Does lots of flash photography?
1118000	1120000	When you do a red carpet?
1120000	1121000	Oh, yeah.
1121000	1123000	I mean, you asked me, is it possible?
1123000	1125000	There's lots of flash photography.
1125000	1127000	You were in that movie recently.
1127000	1128000	Right.
1128000	1129000	That movie called...
1129000	1131000	Well, Lawn Mower Man 3.
1131000	1132000	Yeah, right.
1132000	1134000	Because aren't you Job?
1134000	1138000	Don't you have control over time and space?
1138000	1139000	No, I was just an actor.
1139000	1141000	Well, you're putting me on the spot.
1154000	1156000	I kind of cheated with that one.
1157000	1160000	By cheating, you mean not accomplishing your goal.
1160000	1163000	A broken chain zinger.
1163000	1165000	I want a chain zinger.
1165000	1168000	I mean, these are examples of chain zingers.
1168000	1169000	They're not good ones.
1169000	1173000	You mean that somebody's trying to mooch at you over the long term.
1173000	1175000	They're trying to get you...
1175000	1176000	They set you up.
1176000	1179000	They force you through a series of hoops.
1179000	1184000	Yeah, you just make someone walk with you to the place where you slap them.
1184000	1187000	Why was I in Lawn Mower Man 3...
1187000	1190000	Because you were putting me on the spot.
1195000	1201000	If we call this fucking episode a chain zinger, I'll fucking kill everybody in this room.
1201000	1205000	We only get to call this episode a chain zinger if Dan does a chain zinger,
1205000	1209000	and the audience knows what the hell he's talking about.
1209000	1211000	Do you guys know what I'm talking about?
1211000	1216000	Okay, somebody come up on the stage and chain zing Dan,
1216000	1219000	and prove to me what he's talking about.
1219000	1221000	Precisely. Nobody fucking...
1221000	1223000	No, they're hard. They're hard.
1223000	1225000	I understand the premise.
1225000	1228000	I just want to hear a story about being properly chain zinged.
1228000	1230000	Did Let's Do It? Do you have a chain zinger?
1230000	1232000	Is that what you said, Let's Do It?
1232000	1233000	Yeah.
1233000	1236000	Well, let him do it first.
1236000	1239000	Come up and chain zing.
1241000	1242000	What's your name?
1242000	1243000	Ben.
1243000	1244000	Hello, Ben.
1244000	1245000	We met two days ago.
1245000	1246000	Good to meet you.
1246000	1247000	All right.
1247000	1249000	Are you going to improv a chain zing?
1249000	1255000	Do you have a current existing beef that you're going to zing Dan on in chain fashion?
1255000	1257000	No, it's a half and a half.
1257000	1258000	Okay.
1258000	1261000	Hey, Ben, can I ask you, do you...
1261000	1262000	Do you...
1262000	1263000	Do you...
1263000	1264000	Do you...
1264000	1270000	Do you find it difficult to move?
1270000	1273000	Aren't you part robot?
1273000	1274000	No.
1274000	1278000	Don't you have a speaker for a mouth?
1278000	1280000	Because you're not talking to the microphone.
1280000	1281000	Okay.
1281000	1282000	Okay.
1282000	1283000	Okay.
1283000	1284000	Okay.
1284000	1285000	Okay.
1285000	1286000	Okay.
1286000	1287000	Okay.
1287000	1288000	Okay.
1288000	1289000	Okay.
1289000	1290000	Okay.
1290000	1293000	I see that as a chain zinger, but I don't see that as a zinger.
1293000	1294000	All right.
1294000	1295000	I see the chain...
1295000	1296000	Okay.
1296000	1297000	Okay.
1297000	1298000	Here's the chain zinger.
1298000	1299000	Hey, Dan.
1299000	1300000	Yes, Ben?
1300000	1301000	Did all those doves die?
1301000	1302000	What doves?
1302000	1303000	What are you talking about, Ben?
1303000	1304000	Okay.
1304000	1305000	Okay.
1305000	1306000	Okay.
1306000	1307000	Okay.
1307000	1308000	Okay.
1308000	1309000	Okay.
1309000	1310000	Okay.
1310000	1311000	Okay.
1311000	1312000	Okay.
1312000	1313000	Okay.
1313000	1314000	Okay.
1314000	1315000	Okay.
1315000	1316000	Okay.
1316000	1317000	Okay.
1317000	1318000	Okay.
1318000	1319000	You're both doves.
1319000	1321260	What are you talking about, Ben?
1321260	1324120	Did all those doves die when you and Aaron threw all that rice?
1324120	1326200	What rice did we throw?
1326200	1327680	I don't get it.
1327680	1328680	What do you mean?
1328680	1331880	At your guy's most recent wedding.
1331880	1337720	Yeah, we got married.
1337720	1341280	I mean, when you and Aaron got married to doing chain zingers?
1341280	1342280	Oh!
1342280	1345120	Because we love him so much.
1346120	1349560	That doesn't fucking scan.
1349560	1351680	It doesn't scan at all.
1351680	1353280	They're not easy to do.
1353280	1354280	I know!
1354280	1356960	Give me one version where it works.
1356960	1357960	I want to know.
1357960	1358960	No, because they're hard.
1358960	1361520	Well, then why bring it up?
1361520	1363320	Why bring up skateboarding?
1363320	1364320	Skateboarding's hard.
1364320	1368360	Yeah, but if Tony Hawk came on stage, he could skateboard.
1368360	1369360	Right, but what...
1369360	1370360	Oh shit.
1370360	1373760	What's a chain zinger?
1373760	1374760	We just made it up.
1375560	1380000	Someone had to put wheels on a board before Tony Hawk could ever be good at something.
1380000	1382920	We're sending these people out into the world.
1382920	1384640	That person didn't think he was zinging somebody.
1384640	1387000	He thought he was an engineer.
1387000	1391960	Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, can I ask you a question?
1391960	1394160	Only on one condition, Dan.
1394160	1398360	This is a fucking chain zinger.
1398360	1399640	You can ask me multiple questions.
1399640	1402840	You can ask me as many questions as you want.
1402840	1411400	Does it get lonely being...
1411400	1414520	Does it get lonely being so old?
1414520	1415520	How old?
1415520	1419000	Aren't you like as old as the universe almost?
1419000	1421400	I'm a year younger than you are.
1421400	1423600	Well, but aren't you...
1423600	1424600	You're not hydrogen?
1424600	1430600	No, I'm not hydrogen.
1430600	1431600	But you're at least...
1431600	1433680	A mixture of different other atoms and stuff.
1433680	1434680	Oh, right.
1434680	1435680	Okay.
1435680	1438280	But so mostly water, right?
1438280	1439280	Like...
1439280	1440280	Yeah.
1440280	1445720	I believe a certain high percentage of what makes up a human body is water.
1445720	1455520	Well, that would explain your slight negative charge.
1455520	1456520	Does it work?
1456520	1457520	Doesn't fucking work.
1457520	1470920	Wait, water?
1470920	1471920	Water is negatively charged?
1471920	1475680	Yeah, it has a slight negative charge that's responsible for all life on the Earth.
1475680	1479040	It's responsible for the capillary motion of water...
1479040	1480680	Oh, I'm sorry.
1480680	1481680	Chain zinging.
1481680	1482680	I did.
1482680	1483680	Now I get it.
1483680	1484680	I'm gonna sit down.
1484680	1485680	Okay.
1485680	1486680	Thank you, Ben.
1486680	1491680	Let's get the fuck out of here.
1491680	1497600	Anyways, my wife told me I had the musical taste of a gay drug dealer was the point.
1497600	1500440	See, that's just a zing.
1500440	1502480	Why bring the chain into it?
1502480	1508080	I made a huge mistake when I did that, believe me.
1508080	1510440	Why walk me down a primrose path?
1510440	1511440	I just didn't...
1511440	1515640	I felt like Aaron would yell at me later if I characterized her as just coming down and
1515640	1520920	saying you sound like a gay drug dealer listening to this music because, like, the truth is
1520920	1523160	she was more creative about it.
1523160	1528360	So I wanted to acknowledge that out of fairness, but you got very distracted, like a Jack Russell
1528360	1533080	Terrier staring at a socket that you think a bug went into.
1533080	1534080	No, like an English bulldog.
1534080	1537080	Like an English bulldog I got distracted.
1537080	1539320	Okay.
1539320	1543520	Why does a witticism have to make me go through a bunch of fucking weird hoops?
1543520	1545760	It has to do anything.
1545760	1547320	You're reverse hitler-ing.
1547320	1551600	No, I'm hitler-ing.
1551600	1554520	Reverse hitler-ing is a chain zinger.
1554520	1558520	What were you listening to?
1558520	1560960	She called you that.
1560960	1562960	LCD sound system.
1562960	1567200	All right, now I'm on her side.
1567200	1569120	Which she probably introduced me to.
1569120	1574880	I was listening to a Pandora station based on LCD sound system, so there was, at the
1574880	1575880	time, I guess...
1575880	1576880	But you know what?
1576880	1579200	That's a compliment gay drug dealer for music.
1579200	1582800	I mean, like, one of those guys, they're not...
1582800	1586320	It's not like you get into your gay drug dealer's car and Willie Nelson's on the radio.
1586320	1588920	Oh, Willie Nelson's great.
1588920	1592680	If I have to hear a stranger's music, I hope it's a gay drug dealer.
1592680	1594240	That'll be good music.
1594240	1596960	That enclosed, too, right?
1596960	1599120	You'd want to dress like a gay drug dealer, too, I assume.
1599120	1600880	If you want to be, like, au courant.
1600880	1601880	All right.
1601880	1604920	I mean, they're gay and they deal drugs.
1604920	1607760	They're on the bleeding edge of society.
1607760	1608760	The bleeding edge?
1608760	1609760	Yeah.
1609760	1612080	Yeah, the bloody, bloody edge.
1612080	1613080	You...
1613080	1614080	You...
1614080	1615080	Okay, hey, listen.
1615080	1617080	Can I ask you a question?
1617080	1622000	Dan, you get to ask me as many questions in a row as you want.
1622000	1623960	Were you, like...
1623960	1627520	Were you really hurt?
1627520	1629360	Were your feelings hurt?
1629360	1630360	Just...
1630360	1631360	Just recently?
1631360	1632360	Yeah.
1632360	1635360	Well, specifically when Bruce Wayne hurt them.
1635360	1638400	What are you talking about?
1638400	1651520	Well, when he came to your research facility at Wayne Industries and he rejected your inventions...
1651520	1655520	Dan, can I be honest with you?
1655520	1657320	Yeah.
1657320	1660880	Maybe in the history of my whole life.
1660880	1671240	I don't think there's ever been a time when I have been more hurt when, while I was making...
1671240	1679360	Wayne Industries inventions and Bruce Wayne himself came in and he wasn't fucking digging
1679360	1680360	it.
1681080	1684080	I was fucking mortified.
1684080	1689360	I was almost suicidally hurt when he came in and said, boo, I don't dig it, I don't like
1689360	1690360	it.
1690360	1693360	And that's when you became the Riddler, right?
1693360	1699360	Oh, shit, you're right.
1699360	1701160	I never put those two together.
1701160	1710280	I knew that one day I started becoming a supervillain and asked questions instead of giving answers.
1710280	1712280	That's why you're always questioning me.
1712280	1713280	Right.
1713280	1716280	You ruined my chainsinger.
1716280	1719120	Dan, here's a riddle for you.
1719120	1720120	Riddle me this.
1720120	1722280	Is it hard to ruin a chainsinger?
1722280	1724920	Well, no, it's not.
1724920	1725920	It's not hard.
1725920	1726920	Yeah.
1726920	1727920	All you have to do is to...
1727920	1728920	It's not a magic trick.
1728920	1731680	If you do jumping jacks during it, you can ruin it.
1731680	1733840	If you interrupt it, you ruin it.
1733840	1738560	I'm not allowed to really love chainsingers as a premise or a concept.
1738560	1739560	What do you mean, love them?
1739560	1742680	You're not allowed to ruin them.
1742680	1743680	Do you love chainsingers?
1743680	1744680	I mean, you're allowed to do whatever you want.
1744680	1745680	Do you love chainsingers?
1745680	1746680	I love chainsingers.
1746680	1750600	You, my friend, have been chainsinged.
1750600	1753720	No, you haven't.
1753720	1755920	It doesn't exist.
1755920	1756920	It's not a thing.
1756920	1757920	All right.
1757920	1758920	Well, let's bring out...
1758920	1759920	No!
1759920	1760920	No one comes out.
1760920	1761920	We're gonna fucking finish this.
1761920	1766040	Come on, you're gonna want this guy to come out.
1766040	1767040	Who?
1767040	1768040	He's an old friend.
1768040	1769040	We haven't seen him for a couple weeks.
1770040	1770040	
1770040	1771040	Oh, shit!
1780040	1781040	Curtis.
1782040	1783040	Arm.
1784040	1786040	Strong.
1789040	1790040	Howdy!
1791040	1792040	Hello, Curtis.
1792040	1793040	Howdy.
1793040	1794540	My God.
1794540	1795680	It's so festive here.
1795680	1796680	Yeah.
1796680	1797680	Happy Easter.
1797680	1798680	Thank you so much.
1798680	1802680	I wasn't even going to celebrate, and now I feel like I have to.
1802680	1803680	Yeah.
1803680	1806000	So, were you raised religiously?
1806000	1809400	I was raised religious, I was raised Catholic, yeah.
1809400	1810400	Oh, okay.
1810400	1811400	So, Easter's were pretty heavy duty.
1811400	1813600	Did you get up for the sunrise, sunrise mass?
1813600	1814600	The whole deal.
1814600	1815600	The whole deal.
1815600	1819920	So, my wife couldn't remember because she was the daughter of a pastor, it was.
1819920	1827120	She still is, but she mentioned the sunrise mass thing, but then also all the Easter hiding
1827120	1830360	and stuff like that, but she couldn't remember what order they did them in.
1830360	1834520	Oh, well, I mean, you know, I mean, if you're serious, I mean, we did it, we did everything
1834520	1840480	because we were just, you know, I mean, we were Catholic and we did the whole services
1840480	1844640	and all that, but the Easter eggs were just as big a part of it, but there are a lot of
1844640	1850160	people that I know who were raised where that's like devil's work is doing the Easter egg hunt
1850160	1851640	because it has nothing to do with it.
1851640	1852640	Oh, well, that's kind of admirable.
1852640	1853640	Yeah.
1853640	1854640	I mean, from the Christian perspective.
1854640	1855640	I mean, you know what?
1855640	1858760	I mean, if you're going to go for the religious part of it, you might as well go the whole
1858760	1864480	way and say that it's that Easter eggs are are yeah, like I mean, I get aggravated by
1864480	1865480	this.
1865480	1868440	I mean, you know, technically, of course, they were all it all comes from the pagans
1868440	1869440	anyway.
1869440	1870440	Right.
1870440	1872600	You know, they like the right wing people who talk about the war on Christmas because
1872600	1876400	we want to make it politically correct, but they won't give up their Santa Claus.
1876400	1880240	Like they they really need their Christmas tradition, but their Christmas tradition
1880240	1882200	is based on a bunch of different shit.
1882200	1883200	Exactly.
1883200	1887520	And I think they're living in a little their little 20 year period where nothing's allowed
1887520	1889760	to change during that time.
1889760	1894360	It's like it's like a big chainsinger.
1894360	1896240	I missed the chainsinger part.
1896240	1898760	I came in at the very end of the chainsinger part.
1898760	1901600	Is there anything I need to know?
1901600	1902600	Nothing at all.
1902600	1903600	Okay.
1903600	1904600	All right.
1904600	1905600	Yeah.
1905600	1906600	I mean, you know, it's weird.
1906600	1909600	You're so mad about chainsingers.
1909600	1915120	He said Mr. Kettle to to to Admiral Pot.
1915120	1916520	You're mad about chainsingers.
1916520	1923840	I'm I'm overjoyed with them, but you have Jeff's Jeff's in his cups, as Chevy Chase
1923840	1929120	used to say, you know, about himself on his voicemails.
1929120	1931000	I think I'm delightfully Easter drunk.
1931000	1933760	I think you're yes, you know, there's no negative things.
1933760	1936320	I'm just warning Curtis that you're like a loaded gun.
1936320	1937920	It's a little different.
1937920	1939760	He looks a little different this week.
1939760	1942720	He does.
1942720	1949800	He has a glow or a sheen, depending on depending on whether you want to go a Charlie sort of
1949800	1950800	sheen.
1950800	1957440	They that that sort of disabier, as our friends, the French would say, I don't know that word.
1957440	1963680	You know, little ruffled a little bit, you know, just got out of bed look.
1963680	1967520	I put this together, Curtis.
1967520	1968960	This represents a lot of work.
1968960	1969960	I'm sorry.
1969960	1973120	I thought it was I thought it was an accident.
1973120	1978440	I'm fucking I'm fucking high as a Georgia pine right now.
1978440	1980240	Those are high Georgia pines are high.
1980240	1981240	Oh, yeah.
1981240	1982240	Yeah.
1982240	1983240	Yeah.
1983240	1986240	Dan, can I ask you a question?
1986240	1987240	Yeah.
1987240	1989920	I would try to fucking change thing.
1989920	1990920	I don't know how to do it.
1990920	1992600	Well, yeah, they're hard.
1992600	1993600	You don't want to.
1993600	1994600	They're not like easy.
1994600	1996200	We wouldn't do a podcast about breathing.
1996200	1997680	Like everyone knows how to do that.
1997680	1999240	You do a podcast about macrame.
1999240	2002240	That's hard.
2002240	2007960	I'm not I'm not leaving this building until you've done a successful chainsinger.
2007960	2013360	I would have to sit here in silence like thinking like it's not you know, it's not it's not
2013360	2015840	it wouldn't be a cool thing to do.
2015840	2017320	And the payoff wouldn't be that great.
2017320	2020280	Like it just chainsingers or you got to let just forget about them.
2020280	2022080	I want you to forget about them.
2023080	2027560	There's no there's no joy to come from from you knowing about them.
2027560	2029120	I want you to turn away.
2029120	2030120	Deal.
2030120	2033360	Well, it could also be sort of a long running thing.
2033360	2034360	Couldn't it?
2034360	2039400	I mean, you know, technically, he could think about it and like in two weeks, it could come
2039400	2042160	up and then it's like a callback to the chainsingers.
2042160	2045360	Yeah, he could do like a macro chain.
2045360	2046360	Yeah.
2046360	2049720	Let me see what's on my little my little notepad.
2049720	2050720	What do you have scheduled?
2051720	2057080	Hey, let's see gay drug dealer last nights with Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen.
2057080	2058080	You guys see that?
2058080	2060960	It's like Game of Thrones fan fiction kind of movie.
2060960	2064160	It's a Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen running around swords.
2064160	2067560	No, no, no, that's fine.
2067560	2071360	It's called last nights, which sounds like it's like a date movie or something.
2071360	2075000	But it's Curtis, sir, you were away for a while.
2075000	2076000	Where did you go?
2076000	2085200	I went to I went to Las Vegas and I went to Seattle, Washington.
2085200	2088960	Were you there?
2088960	2091600	You followed me back, didn't you?
2091600	2098200	Yeah, we went to I went to a Comic Con in Seattle and I went to a supernatural thing
2098200	2100560	in Las Vegas.
2100560	2101840	What was the supernatural thing?
2101840	2103920	They do these supernatural thing.
2103920	2106560	You know, supernatural is a show I do.
2106560	2107840	It's one of the other shows I do.
2107840	2108840	Wait, I don't know.
2108840	2109840	It's one.
2109840	2110840	I do when I'm not here.
2110840	2113160	I do another show called supernatural.
2113160	2114160	I've heard of that show.
2114160	2115160	I didn't know you were on it.
2115160	2116160	You're on it as an actor.
2116160	2118680	I've been on it as an actor for about three years.
2118680	2120160	Are you on and off?
2120160	2121800	Are you a werewolf or a vampire?
2121800	2122800	I'm not.
2122800	2126440	I'm I am the evilest creature ever.
2126440	2129640	I'm an evil, evil, evil creature.
2129640	2130640	Yes.
2130640	2131640	She knows.
2131720	2132720	Yes.
2132720	2133720	She knows.
2133720	2134720	What's the?
2134720	2135720	It's Metatron.
2135720	2137240	He's a biblical character, actually.
2137240	2138480	I'm playing a biblical.
2138480	2139840	It's actually appropriate.
2139840	2141840	It's Easter.
2141840	2148760	And I play a biblical character named Metatron, who is or was the scribe of God.
2148760	2155440	Metatron, for those of you who don't know, Metatron was the one who wrote out the Ten
2155440	2156440	Commandments.
2156440	2157440	Whoa.
2157440	2158440	Uh-huh.
2158440	2159440	Uh-huh.
2159440	2160440	Wait, so there was another guy?
2160440	2161440	There was another guy.
2161560	2164840	Basically, on the movies, I always thought there was like a fire that came from the bush
2164840	2165840	into the table.
2165840	2166840	No.
2166840	2167840	No.
2167840	2169720	His voice was the voice from the burning bush.
2169720	2171440	That was Metatron, not God.
2171440	2174920	Oh, this is like a, this is like a...
2174920	2178640	Metatron was the guy who did everything for God.
2178640	2180000	He did everything that God...
2180000	2181560	This is according to what mythology?
2181560	2182560	This is...
2182560	2184880	According to, well, questionable mythology.
2184880	2187720	But he does exist, historically.
2187720	2189960	Is that in the Bible?
2189960	2190960	Is Metatron's name...
2191360	2192360	It's kind of the Bible.
2192360	2195360	Is Metatron's name mentioned in the Bible?
2195360	2196600	The Bible, no.
2196600	2197600	Not in the...
2197600	2198600	I don't think it is.
2198600	2206160	I think it's actually mentioned in, like, ancient Hebrew texts that are sort of questionable.
2206160	2207160	But that's who he is.
2207160	2209040	But everybody assumes...
2209040	2212280	So God didn't give it straight to Moses, it went through Metatron?
2212280	2213280	It went through Metatron.
2213280	2214280	And you play Metatron?
2214280	2215280	Thank you.
2215280	2218280	Yes, I do.
2218280	2220360	It's the role you were born to play.
2220360	2221760	It is the role I was born to play.
2221760	2224120	It's one of the most important roles of my career.
2224120	2225120	Huh.
2225120	2230840	I mean, you know, if you think about it in terms of, you know, there's, you know, like,
2230840	2235840	there's Booger and there's Charles DeMar, and then there's the scribe of God, you know.
2235840	2240360	In terms of function, yeah, you're assisting John Cusack, but now, and then you're going
2240360	2241360	to...
2241360	2242360	And then you're going to God.
2242360	2243360	Yeah.
2243360	2244360	I mean, that's a big deal.
2244360	2245360	So that's who he is.
2246360	2251600	He would transcribe what God wanted said to the Israelites, and he would write it down
2251600	2252840	or speak it.
2252840	2254960	Well, that's what I do.
2254960	2255960	That's not who he is.
2255960	2258840	Why is that not canonical in the Bible?
2258840	2262680	I mean, all the cool stuff is sort of questionable.
2262680	2263680	It's the...
2263680	2265080	What do you call it?
2265080	2267000	It's the Apocrypha.
2267000	2268000	That's what it's called.
2268000	2269760	The Apocrypha, which is...
2269760	2273720	It's supposedly part of it, but it was sort of taken out by people because it was considered
2273720	2274720	a little...
2275080	2276080	Apocryphal.
2276080	2277080	Yeah.
2277080	2278080	The Apocrypha.
2278080	2279080	Is that right?
2279080	2280080	Yeah.
2280080	2281080	Thank you.
2281080	2282080	See?
2282080	2283080	They all know.
2283080	2284080	Yeah.
2284080	2285080	But that was not who Meditron was.
2285080	2288280	My Meditron, the Meditron I play, is the scribe of God, but he's also...
2288280	2296280	Meditron hated Optimus Prime, right?
2296280	2301320	That was in my bio, the bio I wrote for Meditron.
2301320	2302320	That's a callback.
2302320	2304360	I had to bring this up last week, but...
2304360	2308320	I don't know what to do about it yet, but I did want to remind myself to bring it up.
2308320	2309320	Books for prisoners.
2309320	2310320	All right.
2310320	2311320	So these...
2311320	2312320	I saw these...
2312320	2316160	I saw these guys tweeting about it.
2316160	2317600	It was out of Seattle, actually.
2317600	2319200	The organization's out of Seattle.
2319200	2323040	So did you say hi to them?
2323040	2324040	There's a...
2324040	2325040	I can't...
2325040	2328160	Now I can't remember their Twitter handle or whatever, but I got to figure out how to
2328160	2330760	coordinate something with them, because they're...
2330760	2335600	They tweeted at me, because what they do is they try to get books to prisoners, which
2335600	2337800	is already a very worthwhile goal.
2337800	2343800	I mean, as fucked up as our prison system is, we have, as you know, the largest prison
2343800	2349960	population in the world, and we definitely do not rehabilitate them very much.
2349960	2351560	We could definitely do to do that.
2351560	2355800	And the idea that there's a shortage of books that these people are inside prison, the people
2355800	2360960	are asking for books while they're in there, they should be flooded with them.
2360960	2361960	They should...
2361960	2362960	Because they...
2362960	2367520	Books cost nothing because the internet, and also, I think these guys, if they're sitting
2367520	2370320	there going, like, hey, sorry, I murdered that person.
2370320	2373240	I would like to start reading while I'm in here.
2373240	2377160	They shouldn't be empty-handed.
2377160	2379520	I don't know how much we can do about that.
2379520	2382880	It does seem like a really focused, worthwhile cause in general.
2382880	2384960	Maybe I'll put some elbow grease into it and try to help.
2385960	2392440	But I wanted to mention it to our listeners, viewers and listeners, because they specifically
2392440	2400680	tweeted at me about D&D books, because a certain percentage of their prisoners that seek them
2400680	2406680	out are asking for D&D books, and they can't get a hold of those either.
2406680	2411760	And it's like, my God, not only are they asking for books, they're asking for books that would
2411760	2418440	open them up to creativity, to the assembly of their own mythology, to making shit right
2418440	2422560	in a way that doesn't involve, you know, stabbing real people and stuff.
2422560	2426640	You're talking about, like, state and federal prisons, that there's...
2426640	2427640	People are looking for books?
2427640	2430400	Yeah, you know, I don't know all the details about it.
2430400	2433640	I just know this charity is in Seattle, and I know that there are people that are...
2433640	2440440	That they just have this mass shortage of old D&D books, which it seems like this audience
2440760	2443240	would have a surplus of.
2443240	2449320	It seems like there is, if we found out there's a charity out there, people that don't have
2449320	2452440	enough McDonald's wrappers.
2452440	2457160	I'm not saying we're fat, I just mean, it's just like for us, it's kind of like we got
2457160	2459080	a lot of old D&D books, I think.
2459080	2465320	So I don't know if we can have a drive or something like that at some point and ship
2465320	2466320	them like crates of...
2466320	2473560	When we ship one prison, and I'm not trying to be silly, can we pick one prison where
2473560	2479640	we send all of those books to, and the whole prison just starts playing D&D?
2479640	2484600	It's like adopt a prison, it would be like the signs on the freeway.
2484600	2490480	We have to go out and find who the dungeon master of that prison would be, and then that
2490480	2495640	prison starts getting really into fucking Pathfinder or D&D or...
2495640	2499720	It would be amazing to adopt a prison if one podcast adopts one prison and just starts
2499720	2506240	fucking around, kind of like, okay, now we're going to change wardens this week, and we
2506240	2508680	just have our favorite prisoners come on the thing.
2508680	2514360	Their whole prison system, it becomes corrupted because it's based on podcast listenership
2514360	2515360	and stuff.
2515360	2516360	Fantastic.
2516360	2524280	Curtis, you don't know this, but very early on, a long time ago, Dan and I, I think it
2524280	2530160	was before we started recording this, Dan said, let's get together, let's use Harmontown
2530160	2532200	to find a dungeon master.
2532200	2540960	Every week, we'll use it like, the fucking...
2540960	2541960	So drunk.
2541960	2546160	The show is like the voice or whatever.
2546160	2549140	We'll use our show to find the best dungeon master.
2549140	2551120	The first week, we found our friend Spencer.
2551120	2552120	Right.
2552120	2553120	Who I know.
2553120	2556600	And we never looked any further beyond that.
2556600	2562840	Why don't we find a prison and give them all of our D&D books and then turn one prison
2562840	2566480	into a giant D&D campaign?
2566480	2567480	Is it possible?
2567480	2568480	Yes.
2568480	2569480	I don't know.
2569480	2573440	I think we'll start with...
2573440	2581200	Could we get one prison to be really into storytelling and into fantasy and maybe save
2581200	2587440	the world and we bring them on the show or we do a Harmontown from that prison, like
2587440	2588440	Johnny Cash?
2588440	2589440	Yeah.
2589440	2594020	I want to do each week, we have like a guest, an inmate from the prison who's like a year
2594020	2599160	from parole and they're like, they're eligible for early parole and we kind of like, we give
2599160	2600640	them a thumbs up, thumbs down.
2600640	2601640	Yeah.
2601640	2603120	We get a trustee.
2603120	2604120	That's fantastic.
2604120	2605800	I love this idea.
2605800	2610000	Like we pick their brain about what they did to go in and then we're like, what do you
2610000	2611000	think guys?
2611000	2614760	Sorry to me.
2614760	2615760	And then we just let them go.
2615760	2616760	I was like, guess what?
2616760	2617760	You're not going home.
2617760	2621400	Here's a tie instead of handcuffs.
2621400	2626120	I would love to go to an actual prison and actually do a D&D campaign there and play
2626120	2629160	with them there, like come what may.
2629160	2634280	And maybe that positively would affect their parole hearing.
2634280	2637880	Like the guy was so good at committing to his elf character.
2637880	2638880	Yeah.
2639400	2640400	Yeah.
2640400	2644600	I mean, I imagine if you, yeah, if I'm sure if your average parole board overheard a game
2644600	2654080	of Dungeons and Dragons, they'd be very impressed and want you out in the public immediately.
2654080	2655680	Speaking of, let's bring Spencer out.
2655680	2656680	Spencer.
2656680	2657680	Yay.
2657680	2658680	Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
2658680	2674640	Sorry, everybody, that took me a while.
2674640	2677680	Did I miss a high five opportunity there?
2677680	2681200	It's easy because you're going that way and I'm, I'm over here.
2681200	2682200	Yeah.
2682200	2683960	Spencer, your high fives are built in.
2683960	2684960	Oh, okay.
2684960	2685960	Yeah.
2685960	2686960	Good to know.
2687960	2690720	Um, well it's just cause you had a pen in your hand.
2690720	2694560	Are those flowers blocking anyone from seeing your beautiful face?
2694560	2695560	Doug's fine.
2695560	2699440	I think we should strike those as the same theater.
2699440	2701680	Now I can't see Spencer.
2701680	2702680	All right.
2702680	2703680	Yeah.
2703680	2704680	Just put them down there.
2704680	2706400	Put them in front of Dan.
2706400	2707400	What's up you guys?
2707400	2712840	Spencer, could you picture yourself going to like San Quentin or Folsom Prison like
2712840	2718520	Johnny Cash and doing a giant, uh, game mastering back back there.
2718520	2722480	I was just imagining, you know, walking into like just the big prison and then there's
2722480	2728720	like a prison Spencer who's like, you know, he has his lair or whatever he has it all
2728720	2729720	figured out.
2729720	2733760	And he's like, he'd be the dungeon master of the prison and then, you know, we'd meet
2733760	2737600	up and we'd have a whole day of it and we'd learn we were really alike.
2737600	2742640	And you know, maybe we'd even like trade places and he'd go to my house and my job and
2742640	2749080	stuff and kill animals and, you know, cause that's, cause that's what you do.
2749080	2756800	No cause he's a prisoner and all printed prisoners, what would you do in his place in a, in a
2756800	2757800	federal prison?
2757800	2759800	I'd, I'd frolic.
2759800	2762240	No, I don't know.
2762240	2765040	It'd probably be much less entertaining for me.
2765040	2766040	I'd imagine.
2766040	2772620	Oh, it's books to prisoners at B number two, P Seattle, B2P Seattle is their Twitter handle
2773620	2777300	Oh, I'm going to continue to, they were sending me information.
2777300	2778980	They have these letters that they tend to get.
2778980	2780380	They sent me a picture of one of them.
2780380	2785780	I don't think I can read that because of all the swastikas.
2785780	2786780	Just kidding.
2786780	2791420	Prison humor, whatever they had to do in there to survive.
2791420	2792420	That's what you had to do.
2792420	2794420	Now I'm going to turn my back on you.
2794420	2799740	The, yeah, no, I don't know if that would really be, that would probably be really offensive
2799740	2803700	to people whose charities, like they put all this work into like furnishing these people
2803700	2806340	and then you just like kind of do this swastika joke.
2806340	2809900	It's just like every prisoner movie you see, if you're a white guy in prison, you have
2809900	2810900	to be a Nazi.
2810900	2815220	Do you think Dan, like in the Harmon tour, a thing that we did a couple of years ago,
2815220	2820140	we went around the country and proved that Harmon town audiences are like, they resemble
2820140	2821140	each other.
2821140	2823140	Like they're a lot like you guys here.
2823140	2826580	Do you think that we could go do a show in a prison and people would dig it?
2826580	2827580	I don't know.
2827580	2828580	I don't know.
2828580	2833420	I had a wake up call cause I, I, I'm trying to use Lyft instead of Uber now just because
2833420	2838300	I feel like, like the, I just, I haven't met a woman in Los Angeles that doesn't have a
2838300	2840940	story about, that starts with I called an Uber.
2840940	2845060	Like if they're riding by themselves, it's just, it's out of hand and I feel like Uber's
2845060	2850120	not that bad for me, but it just feels like now I feel dirty, like taking, taking Uber.
2850120	2854580	So I took, took a Lyft and it made me feel better because like, I don't know, the guy
2854580	2858780	was like, definitely probably would have treated my wife with respect if he picked
2858780	2859780	her up.
2859780	2862340	But then again, he had his own podcast and was just talking about that.
2862340	2866100	And I was like, take me back to the, take me back to the Uber.
2866100	2871900	I told a Lyft, I told him, I talked to Mr. Lyft.
2871900	2876540	I told him you need to put a switch or if you flip the switch, the driver doesn't fucking
2876540	2877540	talk to you.
2877540	2878540	It'd be so easy.
2878540	2880140	I think that's called getting in the back seat.
2880140	2881140	Maybe.
2881140	2882780	No, well that's what they, they, they, that's a new thing.
2882780	2884300	They didn't used to have that.
2884320	2886660	They just always, you'd sit in the front and then you'd talk.
2886660	2890380	And then so many people were like, I don't want to do this that they, they invented this
2890380	2891420	back seat.
2891420	2892420	You could program a switch.
2892420	2893820	It'd be so easy.
2893820	2894820	Everyone it'd be done.
2894820	2895820	That's a, that's a good idea.
2895820	2896820	Like a little switch.
2896820	2899820	Like I'm not, I'm not feeling in the mood for conversation.
2899820	2902980	What kind of pressure would that put them in the, if, if, if you were like, then you're
2902980	2907540	deliberately not hitting that switch and then they're like, now I gotta talk to this fucker.
2907540	2912820	Um, then it's like those, those, those barber conversations where like 10 minutes into the
2912860	2916860	haircut, they're like, so how's your day?
2916860	2919100	They hate you.
2919100	2920100	This is astonishing.
2920100	2925460	I just took a lift just last week and it was the same guy.
2925460	2929900	He, I swear to God, with the podcast, all the way to the airport.
2929900	2934340	He interviewed me and I mean, it was, it was one of those, it wasn't this guy, wasn't I
2934340	2936340	got a business card?
2936340	2942380	No, no, he, he, he told me to give this to you and I'm not kidding.
2942380	2946060	Oh, it's all right.
2946060	2952660	For all I know, it's a good podcast, but yeah, this was exactly the same thing.
2952660	2957340	I think it's, it's, you know, and this, you know, the questions went, you know, from,
2957340	2964420	you know, subject to subject and the fewer answer words I responded, the more he would
2964420	2965420	ask questions.
2965420	2968980	So it was not like he was getting the fact that I didn't want to talk.
2968980	2971380	It was like a cue to ask more questions.
2971380	2975980	Well, they tell like they hire the drivers based on conversational skills and they do
2975980	2978940	expect them to talk to you consistently the whole ride.
2978940	2981900	It's, it's part of what like their, you know, their business model.
2981900	2982900	That's not true really.
2982900	2983900	Is it?
2983900	2984900	No, it is.
2984900	2987740	That's, that's one of, one of their selling points is they have these conversationalist
2987740	2988740	drivers.
2988740	2989740	Yeah.
2989740	2990860	That's, that's part of their marketing.
2990860	2995580	I thought I was just, I was just lucky that I got one just like yours.
2995580	2996580	They're quite pleasant.
2996580	2999860	If you're into it for that, do you think they take, you know, take them on test drives?
2999860	3002540	Well they do a lot more work than Uber does to vet their employees.
3002540	3003540	I'll tell you that.
3003540	3004540	I mean, it sure seems that way.
3004540	3005540	Yeah.
3005540	3006540	Cause they do.
3006540	3009980	They, they, they make sure that they're people that are like social and can sit and talk
3009980	3012300	and not make people feel weird, I think.
3012300	3015420	So the reason I brought that up is because Jeff asked, do we think we could do a show
3015420	3016420	for a prison?
3016420	3019900	And I was like, I think, I think yesterday I would have been like, yeah, man.
3019900	3024020	Cause I'm like egalitarian, like, like awesomeness.
3024020	3027460	But my Lyft ride over here, I was like, ah, you know what?
3027460	3030060	I don't like most people.
3030060	3032900	Even the ones that like me, even the ones that have podcasts, even the ones I just,
3032900	3033900	I don't like you.
3033900	3034900	I don't like you.
3034900	3036660	You're laughing too much at the hustler billboard.
3036660	3037660	I judge you.
3037660	3038660	I don't.
3038660	3039660	I hate you.
3039660	3040660	I don't.
3040660	3043020	The guy was like, he saw the hustler billboard and it had like a joke on it.
3043020	3044020	It's like a cucumber.
3044020	3048660	And it said stop, stop, uh, violence against vegetables shop at hustler.
3048660	3050740	And the guy, this is, I'm not exaggerating.
3050740	3054260	This is, this is, this is, this was the guy's, uh, response.
3054260	3070300	He's like driving and he was like, oh, fuck that billboard stop violence again.
3070300	3075140	He read it to me and I was like, oh, shit.
3075140	3083140	Oh, oh, like I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
3084140	3085140	oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
3085140	3089140	I tried trying to like scrape my laugh gland.
3089140	3093140	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
3093140	3094140	I get it.
3094140	3096620	Cause it sticks something else in your pussy.
3096620	3097620	I get it.
3097620	3099980	I'm just like, don't, don't put a cucumber in your pussy.
3099980	3100980	I got it.
3100980	3103220	Cucumber wants you to use something else.
3103220	3106220	Maybe a dildo from hustler.
3106220	3107220	Got it.
3107220	3110260	I, I just got that.
3110260	3112340	Me too.
3112540	3113540	Me too.
3113540	3114540	Me too.
3114540	3115540	Me too.
3115540	3116540	Me too.
3116540	3119540	You have been chainsing.
3119540	3121540	I hadn't gotten that.
3121540	3128540	Um, uh, we should bring out my wife, Erin McGathey.
3132540	3134540	Oh, it's Hoppytown.
3135540	3136540	Oh, Hoppytown.
3136540	3137540	Oh.
3149540	3151540	It was me the whole time.
3155540	3156540	Oh, sorry.
3156540	3157540	Go ahead.
3157540	3158540	Um, Jeff.
3158540	3159540	Yes.
3159540	3160540	Uh, do you get nervous?
3160540	3162540	Do you get nervous when you walk across grass?
3162540	3164540	Am I about to be chainsing?
3164540	3167540	Just, uh, do you get nervous walking across grass?
3167540	3168540	Generally, no.
3168540	3169540	I like walking across grass.
3169540	3170540	Really?
3170540	3173540	You're not worried you're going to disappear?
3173540	3175540	Just walking across like a field?
3175540	3176540	Yeah, cause the color.
3176540	3179540	I would think that you'd be afraid that you would just disappear in the grass.
3179540	3182540	Because of walking on green grass.
3182540	3184540	Let me, let me ask you something else.
3184540	3189540	Um, how, uh, do you have any new news from your cardiologist?
3189540	3191540	I've never seen a cardiologist.
3192540	3193540	Oof.
3194540	3197540	I mean, you should, because I heard it's really small.
3197540	3199540	My, my dick?
3200540	3201540	No, your heart.
3201540	3205540	Aren't you a Grinch who hates all joyful things, including chainsingers?
3207540	3208540	It's 9-11.
3208540	3209540	It's 9-11.
3209540	3211540	9-11!
3212540	3214540	That's the response.
3214540	3216540	We want to cultivate.
3218540	3219540	It's 9-11.
3219540	3221540	That's a chain zing?
3222540	3223540	I hear the thing.
3223540	3224540	Now it's 9-12.
3224540	3225540	It's not a zing.
3225540	3226540	Why is that a zing?
3226540	3228540	I see the chain part of that.
3228540	3229540	It's not.
3229540	3230540	It's a jovial thing.
3230540	3235540	Like earlier, Dan was listening to the band Slay Bells, remixed.
3235540	3237540	Slay Bells is a band I like.
3237540	3239540	And the song I even liked.
3239540	3243540	And I do not hate gay drug dealers at all.
3243540	3244540	But it's a jovial thing.
3244540	3246540	It's a fun, it's a fun thing.
3246540	3248540	So walking across grass means I hate all jovials?
3248540	3251540	No, because the Grinch is green!
3251540	3253540	That doesn't fucking scan.
3253540	3254540	It's not a fucking thing.
3254540	3255540	Well, maybe it's not for you.
3255540	3256540	It's not a zinger.
3256540	3258540	It's a chain zinger at the end.
3258540	3259540	You go kaboom!
3259540	3263540	Also, I feel like a zinger should actually just zing on the first fucking try.
3263540	3264540	It doesn't need to be a chain.
3264540	3267540	But well, it's our thing.
3267540	3268540	It's so fun.
3268540	3271540	I want to hear actual proof of it.
3271540	3272540	Okay.
3272540	3276540	You guys keep chainsinging each other and leave me the fuck out of it.
3277540	3282540	I feel like gay drug dealers would be most dangerous.
3282540	3283540	I know.
3283540	3284540	Of course they are.
3284540	3288540	Because they have the efficiency of that whole gay aesthetic way of life.
3288540	3295540	And they're applying that to a very dangerous profession where image is very important
3295540	3298540	and thinking or saying the wrong thing could mean death.
3298540	3299540	Yeah.
3299540	3305540	I think you're doubling down on your environmental risk groups, too, for sociopathology.
3306540	3310540	There's a kid from the Midwest who came out and his parents didn't accept him if that's
3310540	3311540	why he started a drug dealer.
3311540	3312540	Yeah.
3312540	3313540	Whatever makes you a drug dealer.
3313540	3314540	Whatever.
3316540	3318540	It could be the nicest kid in the world.
3318540	3322540	But also, if you got stabbed by a gay drug dealer, you're on the eighth stab.
3322540	3324540	You'd be like, well, I guess.
3327540	3331540	I don't know if he was more likely to stab me than a straight drug dealer or a regular
3331540	3332540	gay man.
3333540	3335540	But I know I shouldn't have gotten in this car.
3338540	3339540	With Campbell.
3340540	3348540	I was driven by an Uber driver once who told me that he was narcoleptic and that he can't
3348540	3351540	walk upstairs without falling down the stairs.
3351540	3353540	And I still don't understand when he met that.
3353540	3354540	He's like, oh, you know stairs.
3354540	3355540	I can't have.
3355540	3358540	He said, your house, you have so many stairs.
3359540	3360540	I can't have that.
3361540	3365540	And you kept telling him to go to a doctor and he was like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3365540	3366540	This is my quirk.
3366540	3367540	This is my quirk.
3368540	3370540	Curtis, do you like music?
3370540	3372540	Do I like music?
3372540	3373540	Music.
3373540	3374540	I love music.
3374540	3375540	Don't fuck.
3375540	3377540	You're about to be changing, motherfucker.
3377540	3378540	Watch out.
3379540	3381540	I'm open to it, actually.
3382540	3386540	Here's my problem with changing is because just seeing somebody just say it and fucking
3386540	3387540	one go.
3387540	3391540	Curtis, Curtis, Curtis, do people ever get frustrated by the noise?
3391540	3392540	Of my music?
3392540	3397540	No, just the noise of your body when you enter a room.
3399540	3400540	This is going to pay off so big.
3400540	3402540	This is going to be a fucking payoff.
3402540	3403540	Sometimes.
3403540	3404540	Great showmanship, Jeff.
3404540	3405540	Your rapper.
3405540	3407540	Your rapper.
3407540	3411540	You fucking show me how this is showmanship, what you about to do, the fucking.
3411540	3412540	Jeff.
3412540	3413540	Yes.
3413540	3415540	I'm talking to her.
3416540	3417540	Tina.
3418540	3423540	Curtis, what you just did is a zinger and that actually works on one fucking pass.
3423540	3426540	I mean, that's what makes this a chain zinger.
3426540	3430540	So, I mean, by your rapper.
3430540	3431540	By my rapper.
3431540	3434540	I mean, because you're so sweet, you must be made out of candy.
3434540	3437540	Oh, a chain snuggle.
3437540	3441540	Not a zinger and just took long to say something nice.
3441540	3442540	That was great.
3442540	3444540	Just say, just say you're sweet.
3444540	3446540	Say you're sweet at all.
3446540	3448540	Wait, what's Jeff's problem with chain zinger?
3448540	3449540	It's fucking stupid.
3449540	3451540	It's fucking worthless and stupid.
3451540	3452540	It's really dumb.
3452540	3453540	Why, though?
3453540	3455540	Are you about to chain zing me?
3455540	3456540	No.
3460540	3466540	Because dragging out a bad zinger over a fucking 17 sentences is not as good as just saying something funny.
3469540	3470540	What?
3470540	3471540	See, that's a zinger.
3471540	3473540	And that's why that's funny.
3473540	3474540	It's funny.
3474540	3475540	It's funny to go.
3475540	3476540	That's right, sister.
3476540	3477540	That's funny.
3477540	3478540	It's a loving thing.
3478540	3479540	Can I ask you why?
3479540	3480540	That's stupid.
3480540	3482540	I still want to hear why Jeff doesn't like him.
3482540	3483540	I feel like...
3483540	3485540	Because I have yet to be entertained by one.
3485540	3486540	Okay.
3486540	3487540	Well, they're not for you.
3487540	3488540	They're not changing me.
3488540	3489540	It's changing me, Spencer.
3489540	3491540	Or it's changing anybody in the building.
3491540	3492540	Okay.
3492540	3494540	And make it worth my fucking money.
3494540	3496540	It's not going to happen.
3496540	3497540	It's not going to happen.
3497540	3501540	The problem with chain zingers is you've got to start by working backwards and then you've got to...
3501540	3505540	And slowing down the fucking payoff, which is just say something witty.
3505540	3506540	Just say something witty.
3506540	3507540	Well, yeah.
3507540	3509540	That's the whole thing is that you're delaying the payoff.
3509540	3510540	Right.
3510540	3512540	And then the payoff is really not worth all the fucking stretch.
3512540	3513540	Yeah.
3513540	3514540	It's like an anti joke.
3514540	3517540	It's another way of saying I love you because it's never a mean thing that's said really.
3517540	3523540	I feel like it was pretty mean when you said he had the music tastes of a gay drug dealer.
3523540	3524540	That seems mean.
3524540	3525540	That doesn't seem loving.
3525540	3529540	But that's a bit that Dan and I have with us is that...
3529540	3531540	That's not a chain zing.
3531540	3532540	No, it was still a chain zing.
3532540	3534540	But I'm saying that it's not a...
3534540	3535540	You know what zing means, right?
3535540	3536540	You know what a zinger is.
3536540	3537540	I feel like it is an insult.
3537540	3539540	Do you know what a chain zing is?
3539540	3541540	No one knows what a fucking chain zing is.
3544540	3545540	You don't fucking know.
3545540	3546540	It's not good.
3546540	3552540	I feel like just the equivalent of you are mad at slipping slides for not being like subways.
3552540	3553540	Yeah.
3553540	3554540	Just take it.
3554540	3555540	Just put a token in it.
3555540	3557540	Don't you show up.
3557540	3558540	Take me to work.
3558540	3559540	Take me to work.
3559540	3560540	Why is my lawn wet?
3560540	3562540	If I want to go somewhere...
3562540	3568540	The only thing funny about that, Dan, was you fixing your rabbit ears while you did that bit.
3568540	3570540	That's not the only thing.
3570540	3576540	But we're not here to figure out what's wrong or what's right about anything that any of us are doing.
3576540	3579540	Jeff, do you remember a couple of Easters ago when we all flew kites?
3579540	3580540	It was the best.
3580540	3581540	It was very fun.
3581540	3582540	It was great.
3582540	3583540	Thank you, Erin.
3583540	3584540	That's a nice thing to say.
3584540	3585540	The end.
3586540	3591540	What if Jeff just said the end after every sentence I ever uttered?
3591540	3593540	What if I said the end and it actually was the end?
3593540	3595540	That'd be fucking paradise.
3595540	3597540	What do you mean?
3597540	3598540	You want to leave?
3598540	3599540	No.
3599540	3600540	He's saying he doesn't want me to say anything.
3600540	3602540	Chain zingers don't fucking work for me.
3602540	3603540	That's noted.
3607540	3612540	What doesn't happen in the chain zinger is that there's no zinging at the end of the chain.
3612540	3615540	What happens in your criticism of chain zingers?
3615540	3616540	What's the payoff?
3616540	3619540	Only the end of chain zinging.
3619540	3621540	Well, that hasn't happened yet.
3621540	3622540	Sadly, no.
3622540	3628540	In terms of the amount of verbiage that goes into something versus the amount of entertainment that comes out of it,
3628540	3632540	how does chain zinging compare to your criticism of it?
3634540	3638540	I think they completely cancel each other out.
3639540	3640540	No.
3640540	3641540	No.
3641540	3646540	No, I'm miserable because of your totally needless hatred of something stupid.
3646540	3647540	And wait a minute.
3647540	3648540	Can I say something?
3648540	3649540	Yes.
3649540	3650540	You know what?
3650540	3652540	She gave me a chain zinger, which was really nice.
3652540	3653540	Right.
3653540	3654540	It was a compliment.
3654540	3658540	And it was a compliment, and she said it with a smile, and then she gave me a hug.
3658540	3662540	And she could have gone on for half an hour, and I would have been fine with that.
3662540	3665540	See, I agree with that.
3665540	3666540	I love it.
3666540	3667540	I'm an angel.
3667540	3668540	I'm an evil buddy.
3668540	3673540	Dan, you also know that my fake hatred of chain zinging is only fake hatred.
3673540	3674540	I just don't quite understand.
3674540	3675540	I don't know about that.
3675540	3676540	Very convincing.
3678540	3680540	The King of the Nerds is over, right?
3680540	3682540	It's over for another season.
3682540	3683540	What's-his-name-won?
3683540	3685540	What's-his-name-won.
3685540	3687540	God bless him.
3687540	3688540	Jonathan won.
3688540	3690540	Did we talk about our first male?
3690540	3694540	But isn't that interesting, though, that this was the first male winner?
3694540	3698540	And I can't remember if we talked about this, but is this the first season?
3698540	3706540	I'm sure this has happened on other reality shows, but this one began with the girls immediately
3706540	3712540	making a macro alliance, almost exclusively across gender lines, excluding only two girls.
3712540	3713540	Yeah.
3713540	3717540	And it was really effective, and they just squeezed the guys up like toothpaste.
3717540	3718540	Well, for a while it was.
3718540	3719540	Yeah, that's true.
3719540	3724540	And when they drew it to a man, all of the guys were eliminated with absolutely no idea
3724540	3725540	that this was going on.
3725540	3726540	That's right.
3726540	3729540	It was like this biological phenomenon that just went...
3729540	3732540	And they just squeezed the testosterone, like popping a zit.
3732540	3733540	Pretty much.
3733540	3737540	But the one guy that they let into that fucking alliance...
3737540	3738540	No, they let in two.
3738540	3739540	Oh, it was the other guy?
3739540	3743540	And the other guy, they wound up competing against each other at the end.
3743540	3745540	Which was so biological.
3745540	3751540	It might as well have been those rhino beetles trying to throw each other off of a twig while
3751540	3754540	all these women watched.
3754540	3756540	But I just think that's very interesting.
3756540	3759540	It was the first season that I had seen that happen where the girls did this really effective
3759540	3762540	thing that almost threatened to kind of destroy the show.
3762540	3763540	It was so simple.
3763540	3764540	I know.
3764540	3767540	That was the thing that I loved about it, was that these women got together and they wound
3767540	3769540	up letting a couple of guys in.
3769540	3777540	But before they let the guys in, the idea was cross-team alliance to keep men out.
3777540	3782540	Based on the very practical, simple solution, which is that women built in.
3782540	3788540	They're in the women's bathroom together and they have that time together.
3788540	3793540	And no one is going to suspect anything is off kilter if all of them are gone for a half
3793540	3797540	hour and all come out at the same time because we don't know what goes on in there.
3797540	3803540	It was a super smart objective alliance technique because you can just say, well, it's just women
3803540	3806540	because we're women, not because we don't like you or anything.
3806540	3809540	If you did that with any other quality and your other attribute genetically, you would
3809540	3810540	do a big trouble.
3810540	3811540	It's just the fairest skin.
3811540	3812540	Just the tall people.
3812540	3815540	We don't show the short people got to go.
3815540	3816540	That's all it is.
3816540	3822540	But mind you, as effective as it was as a strategy, two men wound up competing and one
3822540	3824540	of them actually won.
3824540	3826540	And it was the first male winner.
3826540	3832540	The one woman who was left out of the alliance was one of the final four.
3832540	3837540	So it really, it was a strange series of things, but I loved it.
3837540	3838540	I had a great time.
3838540	3839540	It was a great season.
3839540	3841540	We really loved Colby.
3841540	3844540	He was such a fascinating architect.
3844540	3851540	He was like if a hack white writer wrote like a magical black reality show contestant because
3851540	3853540	he was there.
3853540	3858540	The reason he was a nerd is because he grew up in the streets and wanted to make his mom
3858540	3859540	happy.
3859540	3863540	And he was a teacher and I knew how the students were watching.
3863540	3867540	I was like every single thing he said, it was like, wait, did William Goldman write
3867540	3868540	you?
3868540	3870540	I don't mean William Goldman's a hack.
3870540	3871540	I didn't mean that.
3871540	3877540	But I mean, he wrote Good Will Hunting and didn't even take credit.
3877540	3882540	Like Colby was like, he had that mood shift where it was like, I don't know how much of
3882540	3885540	this is editing, but like he felt betrayed at one point.
3885540	3888540	Like they put him up like on this all, you know, the sacrifice him.
3888540	3890540	And he never really recovered from that emotionally.
3890540	3891540	It looked like.
3891540	3892540	Yeah.
3892540	3893540	Yeah.
3893540	3894540	He was odd.
3894540	3898540	He had an odd feeling with the rest of them because he really, I mean, he wanted to be
3898540	3899540	there obviously.
3899540	3901540	And he'd done, what do you call it?
3901540	3902540	Jeopardy.
3902540	3904540	He'd won Jeopardy like three times or something.
3904540	3910540	So the guy has obviously had experience, but it's unusual when they get into that, into
3910540	3911540	nerdvana.
3911540	3914540	It does weird things.
3914540	3917540	One of the most outrageous, see the thing that had me like conjuring my fist and yelling
3917540	3923540	at the TV was the week, the moment when he came back, they had tried to kill him and
3923540	3924540	failed.
3924540	3927540	So now he comes back and there's always that weird thing in all reality shows like, oh,
3927540	3931540	you tried to, you tried to slit my throat and your knives didn't work.
3931540	3933540	So let's play part cheesy.
3934540	3939540	But they like, it was really like, I found it really culturally fascinating that here
3939540	3945540	he is sitting there a little dour, not totally willing to play improv Star Wars with them.
3945540	3951540	My read was that he was like over it because there was kind of like a clicky like group
3951540	3952540	sex vibe a little bit.
3952540	3953540	Yeah.
3953540	3954540	There was that.
3954540	3958540	And that's when they all started in this thing that that drove me a little crazy where they
3958540	3961540	were like, also they were drinking and he wasn't, he wasn't.
3961540	3962540	He wasn't.
3962540	3966540	They started playing the nerd card in order to try to like, they're like, come on, we're
3966540	3967540	all nerds.
3967540	3970540	Like, like, it's like, yeah, we're all nerds, but betrayals betrayal.
3970540	3973540	And then we all know what it feels like to be picked on and kicked out.
3973540	3974540	Yeah.
3974540	3977540	But you meet you less so right now at this particular Ides of March.
3977540	3980540	And then they became, they became like the bullies on the bus.
3980540	3982540	When you were a kid, they were like, oh, you've showered.
3982540	3983540	Come on, man.
3983540	3984540	Yeah.
3984540	3985540	Like we're all.
3985540	3986540	And then it's like the worst bullying.
3986540	3987540	I thought that was a really interesting family.
3988540	3991540	The show continues to fascinate me because again, they're like, it's real nerds.
3991540	3999540	They actually like, like they and the the reality show shit is all the same, but it
3999540	4004540	reveals like more honest stuff than just like, oh, this Barbie doll broke in this way.
4004540	4006540	And this one broke in this way.
4006540	4008540	It's like, I like watching those dynamics.
4008540	4009540	Thanks.
4009540	4013540	That, that, that, that heavy fellow that had the nervous breakdown is comparing himself
4013540	4018540	to Ra's al Ghul is like using Ra's al Ghul as a mentor.
4018540	4022540	He's like, like, look, there's the reason I'm acting this way because Ra's al Ghul
4022540	4023540	would do this and that.
4023540	4025540	Like, well, that's okay.
4025540	4027540	Batman hates him.
4027540	4031540	Anyways, you should you should watch it.
4031540	4032540	It's what is it?
4032540	4034540	You could watch it on demand or something.
4034540	4038540	You can watch it on TBS on demand or you can watch it on iTunes, I think.
4038540	4041540	And can we just check in about you want to just just just just we'll just bump it
4041540	4042540	and glance off.
4042540	4047540	But the the topic of Bobby's doing Bobby Carradine.
4047540	4053540	Bobby Carradine was in a big car accident in in in Colorado the last week of the last
4053540	4054540	episode.
4054540	4057540	So it was kind of distressing.
4057540	4063540	He seems to be on the mend, which is absolutely a miracle given given what that car looked
4063540	4064540	like.
4064540	4065540	Yeah.
4065540	4066540	No, he's done.
4066540	4067540	Thank you.
4067540	4068540	Thank you.
4068540	4069540	Well, that's good.
4069540	4070540	And his wife was.
4070540	4071540	Yeah, she was fine.
4071540	4072540	Oh, she was.
4072540	4073540	Believe it or not.
4073540	4074540	I mean, she walked away.
4074540	4075540	Man.
4075540	4076540	There was nothing left of this car.
4076540	4081540	The way that you see the picture of the car, there's nothing left of the car.
4081540	4088380	And we're on the verge in our lifetime, I think, unless unless unless actuarial tables
4088380	4089380	are correct.
4089380	4093760	We in our in my lifetime, we will see self driving cars.
4093760	4099620	We will see like a kind of Google like like grid of like cars that take you like like
4099620	4103820	I don't know that they won't have a steering wheel, but but like we're going to see this
4103820	4104820	happening.
4104820	4110860	The big question that Spencer and I have we've been talking about it is once once that starts
4110860	4116660	happening and it has this incredible impact on the amount of car accidents that happen,
4116660	4121260	are they going to start making cars out of paper and are they going to like it'll be
4121260	4126780	interesting to watch like human society to decide like, well, what about these two thousand
4126780	4129640	seventeen safety standards that we keep?
4129640	4133580	We keep we keep jacking that up and playing this game of like insurance claims versus
4133580	4138060	fatalities versus statistics versus traffic.
4138060	4144260	And the like if we were able to switch over to a system by which cars gotten relatively
4144260	4150260	few car accidents, would we immediately drop all that shit or and then make cars really
4150260	4155180	unsafe so that so that the handful of times when a computer crashed a car like it was
4155180	4160140	this horrible human sacrifice on the on the altar of Skynet.
4160140	4163700	But everyone just looked the other way, you know, just like, well, you know, we all got
4163700	4164700	to go to work.
4164700	4168220	So our paper, two paper cars got crumbled into each other.
4168220	4173900	And it was just skull against skull like like I don't know.
4173900	4178380	I wonder if they're going to do that or if they'll keep making cars out of like these
4178380	4183720	these cages with these air balloons and stuff in a sophisticated way because it's very impressive
4183720	4185360	what we've come to so far.
4185360	4190320	Yes, it is.
4190320	4191320	You know what?
4191320	4193360	Poor taste for me to talk about it right now.
4193360	4194360	All right.
4194360	4197400	So but it was it was it was on my mind.
4197400	4198400	Thank you for asking.
4198400	4199400	No, he's doing well.
4199400	4201240	He's that's that's fantastic.
4201240	4202240	All right.
4202240	4207360	So, look, I mean, I think we didn't accomplish that much last week.
4207360	4210280	I think it might have only crossed the street last time.
4210280	4211280	We got it.
4211280	4212720	We got to get we got to get the mortgage up here.
4212720	4231720	So for the first time in a while, we have a full complement of our Shadowrun cast up
4231720	4232720	here.
4232720	4233720	I love it.
4233720	4234720	Yeah, fabulous.
4234720	4237800	I was very excited last time because remember, Jen was here.
4237800	4238800	Yeah.
4238800	4239800	The woman you called up for.
4239800	4240800	Is she here?
4240800	4241800	She's not here tonight.
4241800	4242800	She was here last time.
4242800	4244920	And I finally got what I'm supposed to do.
4244920	4245920	Oh, really?
4245920	4246920	Just from watching her.
4246920	4248920	You're supposed to ask questions.
4248920	4249920	Oh, really?
4249920	4250920	Yeah.
4250920	4251920	You can ask anything you want.
4251920	4252920	I know.
4252920	4256400	I never thought about asking questions until she she said, can I do such and such?
4256400	4257400	Oh, yeah.
4257400	4258400	Yeah.
4258400	4259400	I went.
4259400	4260400	Oh, my God.
4260400	4261400	I should have been asking.
4261400	4262400	Spencer loves that.
4262400	4263400	Well, I know.
4263400	4264400	I'm going to do it this time.
4264400	4265400	Yeah.
4265400	4266400	I love I love questions.
4266400	4270560	I I watched I watched last last week's show as it was happening.
4270560	4276800	I would kind of like to do my character as Julia do it.
4276800	4277800	She she was.
4277800	4278800	She was interesting.
4278800	4279800	Yeah.
4279800	4282760	I saw her in line earlier when I had my my big mask on.
4282760	4284480	Is she here tonight?
4284480	4285480	She is.
4285480	4291200	I'm not sure who can you guys take top and pass the rest down.
4291200	4294880	It's always been that way.
4294880	4298840	Julia, how are you feeling?
4298840	4302880	Yeah, Julia, what are you on right now?
4302880	4303880	Nope.
4303880	4304880	Nope.
4304880	4305880	All right.
4305880	4311760	Spencer, do we have a guest author of the recap?
4311760	4313640	Yeah, but I can't remember who it is.
4313640	4316640	It was someone on Reddit.
4316640	4317640	I'll get you back.
4317640	4318640	Reddit guy.
4318640	4319640	Shall we just give it a try?
4319640	4320640	Down.
4320640	4321640	All right, Spencer.
4321640	4324440	Take it away from an anonymous recap author.
4324440	4325440	Sorry.
4325440	4326440	Reddit guy.
4327440	4341160	Last time on Harman Time Shadow Run, Mercy O'Donnell went into the burger tyrants.
4341160	4342160	All right.
4342160	4343160	That's it.
4343160	4344160	That's how much ground we covered.
4344160	4345160	Sorry, I'm sorry.
4345160	4346160	I'm sorry.
4346160	4347160	Let the punishment fit the crime.
4347160	4348160	I'm sorry.
4348160	4349160	I'm sorry.
4349160	4350160	I'm sorry.
4350160	4351160	I'm sorry.
4351160	4352160	I'm sorry.
4352160	4353160	I'm sorry.
4353160	4354160	I'm sorry.
4354160	4360800	Let the punishment fit the crime because we didn't do shit.
4360800	4362400	She had like a Carol Burnett laugh.
4362400	4365480	She had a very delightful laugh.
4365480	4370160	Can you laugh?
4370160	4371640	Can you laugh?
4371640	4372640	Like that.
4372640	4373640	I enjoyed her.
4373640	4376640	She was a delight.
4376640	4386160	She was like a pine tree air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror of the stage.
4386160	4388120	She was like a beautiful hot air balloon.
4388120	4393760	Spencer, she was going to meet, was it Anthony Spagulli?
4393760	4395760	Arturo Spagulli.
4395760	4396760	Spagulli.
4396760	4397760	Spagulli.
4397760	4398760	She's sorry.
4398760	4401640	My writing is wow.
4401640	4404320	So we're meeting Arturo Spagulli.
4404320	4405320	Yeah.
4406320	4409240	Mercy is in there.
4409240	4413320	You guys are outside actually just kind of waiting for her.
4413320	4414320	Okay.
4414320	4415320	I have a snack.
4415320	4416320	I don't know what I'm going to be doing.
4416320	4417320	I have made a mistake.
4417320	4418320	Someone else do this.
4418320	4419320	Someone else do this right now.
4419320	4420320	Okay.
4420320	4421320	Okay.
4421320	4422320	Come on.
4422320	4423320	Come on.
4423320	4424320	Come on.
4424320	4425320	Come on.
4425320	4426320	Come on.
4426320	4427320	I'm high.
4427320	4428320	I'm high.
4428320	4429320	I'm sorry.
4429320	4430320	I'm high.
4430320	4431320	I'm high.
4431320	4432320	I'm high.
4432320	4433320	I'm high.
4433320	4434320	I'm sorry.
4434320	4435320	I'm high.
4435320	4436320	I'm high.
4436320	4437320	Okay.
4437320	4445320	I would like a hot dog wink.
4445320	4449320	Can I veto this?
4449320	4450320	Yes.
4450320	4456320	That was my O to Julia as a...
4456320	4461320	Let's get drunk after a girl.
4462320	4463320	Hi.
4463320	4464320	I'm sorry.
4464320	4465320	What am I doing?
4465320	4466320	You're standing in a burger, Tyra.
4466320	4467320	Right.
4467320	4468320	And I'm looking for this guy's...
4468320	4469320	I'm sorry.
4469320	4478320	The plan was for you to go in and just lure this guy out using the oldest weapon in the
4478320	4479320	business.
4479320	4482320	Old Smith and Sexton.
4482320	4483320	Hi.
4483320	4484320	Hi.
4484320	4485320	Hi, young man.
4485320	4488320	I know you hear this every day.
4488320	4495320	It's my girlfriend's bachelorette, and our stripper didn't show up, and we would never
4495320	4500320	ask you to strip, but a couple of the girls have a crush on you.
4500320	4505320	Could you just come out and take a picture with us quickly for a second?
4505320	4510320	Arturo is wearing a fine Italian suit and stuffing burgers in his face.
4510320	4512320	He's holding a burger in each hand.
4512320	4515320	His hands are full of burgers.
4515320	4521320	He barely seems, you know, bothered by the words coming out of yours in the mouth.
4521320	4523320	He's like, no can do, honey.
4523320	4524320	Sorry.
4524320	4526320	He's like, um, um, um.
4526320	4527320	Okay.
4527320	4531320	I'm going to use con.
4531320	4533320	I think you already were.
4533320	4534320	All right.
4534320	4536320	How about negotiation?
4536320	4537320	Okay.
4537320	4538320	All right.
4538320	4539320	Hey, look.
4539320	4540320	You come outside.
4540320	4542320	I'll give you a kiss on your balls.
4542320	4546320	One single kiss.
4546320	4551320	You see, now we're playing shadow run.
4551320	4554320	See, Julian, that's all you had to do.
4554320	4557320	That was your crime was not doing that.
4557320	4558320	Just walk in.
4558320	4561320	Walk in and offer a ball kiss.
4561320	4563320	Look, I'm a classy lady.
4563320	4566320	I just have this thing with kissing anonymous balls.
4566320	4571320	Just come outside, and I'll just give you a little kiss on the balls.
4571320	4572320	I'm kind of busy.
4572320	4574320	Give me, give me 20 minutes.
4574320	4575320	I'll be right out.
4575320	4576320	Yeah.
4576320	4577320	This guy's just like me.
4577320	4578320	He's having a process.
4578320	4579320	What?
4579320	4586320	He's like you want way when someone says kiss, kiss your balls.
4586320	4587320	You say, give me 20 minutes.
4587320	4591320	Can I, can I use perception to see like, why, why the delay?
4591320	4593320	Uh, what?
4593320	4597320	Can I use perception to understand like why he doesn't want his balls kissed immediately?
4598320	4603320	You see, you don't see a reason why he doesn't want his balls kicked.
4603320	4604320	Yeah, yeah.
4604320	4605320	Kicked.
4605320	4606320	I'm kissed.
4606320	4610320	Is it possible that from a distance I might cast a spell?
4610320	4612320	Uh, yeah.
4612320	4613320	If you can, yeah.
4613320	4616320	Anyone you can see, you could probably cast a spell out.
4616320	4618320	Might I enter the room?
4618320	4619320	I enter the room.
4619320	4620320	Okay.
4620320	4625320	You enter the room, and the, the guy, he drops his burgers and draws two pistols.
4625320	4628320	The fry cooks each draw a pistol in appointment, you guys.
4628320	4631320	They're like, get the fuck out of here, boy.
4631320	4632320	Sorry.
4632320	4633320	That's rude.
4633320	4636320	Well, I'm sorry.
4641320	4644320	Hard to go to, hard to go to Swedish, right?
4644320	4645320	No.
4645320	4648320	What do you, there's black people in Sweden.
4648320	4650320	Well, that raises the question.
4650320	4652320	Is it hard to guard black?
4652320	4653320	It's a, I don't know.
4653320	4654320	It's hard to guard black.
4655320	4656320	Absolutely not.
4656320	4657320	Then it's fine.
4657320	4658320	It's all fine.
4658320	4660320	It's all fine.
4660320	4666320	The problem of playing a boy is that I am tiny and short, and have certain possibilities
4666320	4668320	that I might need to be IT.
4668320	4672320	However, I feel like it's happening right now.
4672320	4679320	Given, given the landscape that you have left out, I believe shouting at me that I can see
4679320	4683320	you, and given that I can see you, perhaps I can cast a spell.
4683320	4684320	All right.
4684320	4687320	What do you want to cast?
4687320	4692320	A spell of stupidity in which you are open to suggestion.
4692320	4694320	Can I, can I just pull?
4694320	4695320	Is that a real thing?
4695320	4696320	Yes.
4696320	4700320	Can I pull hard guard aside for a second?
4700320	4701320	I'm standing here.
4701320	4702320	We're in the middle of a move, sorry.
4702320	4703320	Yeah.
4703320	4707320	Like, well, you're, you're good 10, 15 feet off, and there's like four guns on the guys,
4707320	4708320	so.
4708320	4709320	Okay.
4709320	4710320	I don't know.
4710320	4711320	You're, I mean, you could do something, but it might spook people.
4711320	4714320	Who has cast a spell of susceptibility then?
4714320	4716320	Is that a spell that you have?
4716320	4719320	That just makes you more hurt by things?
4719320	4720320	No.
4720320	4723320	It makes the subject more susceptible.
4723320	4725320	Could I, may I ask a question?
4725320	4726320	Yeah.
4726320	4735320	Could I cast a spell and put him into a complete troll skin?
4735320	4737320	Wait, what?
4737320	4738320	A troll skin.
4738320	4739320	It's armor.
4740320	4741320	And I'm the doctor.
4741320	4742320	I think you have troll skin.
4742320	4743320	I don't think you could give troll skin.
4743320	4744320	No, no, no.
4744320	4754320	According to, excuse me, but, but according to this, uh, I've got, I've got, I can, I
4754320	4756320	can, uh, well, maybe it is me.
4756320	4757320	Yeah.
4757320	4758320	I think it's you.
4758320	4759320	Is it under armor?
4759320	4760320	Yeah.
4760320	4761320	Troll skin.
4761320	4762320	Nevermind.
4762320	4763320	You can put it on and run in front of it.
4763320	4764320	Seriously.
4764320	4765320	Is there a susceptibility spell?
4765320	4767320	I don't mean to, if there is, you could do it.
4768320	4771320	I have heard of it, but how, however, let's try this.
4771320	4772320	Let's not, let's not test.
4772320	4773320	You're just making up spells?
4773320	4774320	No.
4774320	4775320	This is one that I've read up.
4775320	4778320	Is it on your spell list?
4778320	4781320	No, it's not.
4781320	4783320	It has to be one of the spells that you know.
4783320	4785320	I don't think it is.
4785320	4788320	Are you trying to shadow run?
4788320	4790320	Might I use, no.
4790320	4795320	I would like to cast turn everyone into pillows.
4796320	4798320	I don't think that's a spell you have.
4798320	4802320	Might I use a mind probe to find what his resistance is to the
4802320	4804320	face that no one can resist?
4804320	4806320	Uh, who?
4806320	4808320	The guy with the burgers?
4808320	4810320	Yeah.
4810320	4811320	Yeah.
4811320	4812320	Okay.
4812320	4815320	So fun fact, casting a spell, it takes some time.
4815320	4818320	And if you cast a spell, people know you're casting a spell.
4818320	4822320	And casting spells also causes like apocalypses and people's
4822320	4823320	heads to explode.
4823320	4826320	So it might be really, really a threatening thing to do.
4826320	4827320	Right.
4827320	4828320	Put the mind probe.
4828320	4829320	Mm-hmm.
4829320	4832320	But he's saying like, it's the, they got their guns on you and
4832320	4833320	they told you to get the fuck out.
4833320	4837320	If you cast a spell, it's the equivalent of pulling a gun out.
4837320	4839320	Like they might shoot you.
4839320	4840320	Yeah.
4840320	4841320	Right.
4841320	4842320	So maybe, maybe.
4842320	4843320	So maybe.
4843320	4844320	Do more good for me.
4844320	4846320	So all we want is to get our tourist Pagulli out of there.
4846320	4849320	Mercy O'Donnell asked, I'll suck your dick.
4849320	4850320	Or lick your balls.
4850320	4851320	He loves burgers.
4851320	4852320	I will kiss your balls.
4852320	4853320	A single time.
4853320	4854320	He said he'll be out in 20.
4854320	4855320	He said give me 20 minutes.
4855320	4856320	Should we just wait him out or should we?
4856320	4857320	Yeah.
4857320	4858320	Yeah.
4858320	4859320	All right.
4859320	4860320	20.
4860320	4861320	Yeah.
4861320	4862320	Let's wait him out.
4862320	4863320	Well, I'm.
4863320	4864320	Can we just cool our heels for 20 minutes?
4864320	4865320	Well, I mean, yeah.
4865320	4867320	Like, uh, Hordegard, get out of there.
4867320	4870320	Is it possible that I might order a burger?
4870320	4871320	Not.
4871320	4872320	That's possible.
4872320	4876320	Which, which given might take 35 minutes or so.
4876320	4880320	You go outside and you leave your weapons outside and then you come
4880320	4882320	back and you get all the burgers you need, my friend.
4882320	4883320	I said any guy.
4883320	4884320	I require one.
4884320	4885320	Okay.
4885320	4886320	All right.
4886320	4887320	Even that amount.
4887320	4891320	I get in the comm link and say, everybody, let's just buy it our time.
4891320	4893320	20 minutes.
4893320	4896320	Mercy's going to kiss a couple balls.
4896320	4898320	We're going to get our tourist Pagulli out here.
4898320	4899320	We'll take him.
4899320	4900320	We'll get the money.
4900320	4901320	That's going to be good.
4901320	4902320	Right?
4902320	4903320	Yeah.
4903320	4904320	I apply a lot of chapstick.
4904320	4907320	Is, uh, is Curtis's character in the car with me?
4907320	4908320	Uh, yeah.
4908320	4909320	I'm still there.
4909320	4910320	Yeah.
4910320	4911320	All right.
4911320	4912320	Dialogue break.
4912320	4913320	What?
4913320	4921320	So, uh, oh, uh, haven't been on a lot of shadow runs with you.
4921320	4931720	Well, you know, uh, these always make me very nervous, the shadow runs as a man of medicine
4931720	4934600	becomes this destructive force.
4934600	4941140	That's the problem is I figure sometimes I try to resist, but sometimes I have powers
4941140	4946920	and it's more than I can do to control them.
4946920	4951640	You go on shadow runs to exercise your powers?
4951640	4955840	How I go on shadow runs in case anyone else is hurt.
4955840	4962720	That's my job as a doctor, but sometimes, sometimes when we get into these kinds of situations,
4962720	4968560	I do have powers that I lose control over.
4968560	4971160	Like that agony spell?
4971160	4977520	I was just thinking about that one because I was thinking that if there's a problem in
4977520	4983080	there, I may have to use the agony spell, which goes against all of my rules as a doctor.
4983080	4984080	Yeah.
4984080	4988240	I'm kind of conflicted because, uh, you know, I want this one to go clean, but, uh, really
4988240	4993360	loved you casting that agony spell.
4993360	4997120	I wanted to do the troll skin, but I wasn't allowed to.
4997120	4998120	I don't think so.
4998120	5002440	Now I'm going to have to do the agony spell ready.
5002440	5003440	You're going to do it now.
5003440	5004440	Yeah.
5004440	5005440	No, don't know.
5005440	5009520	I jump on the comic and go, boys, if you're thinking about casting agony spells, can we
5009520	5013440	just wait 15 minutes to get this fuck out of the car waiting?
5013440	5017760	I mean, I mean, I can do it just through the window.
5018760	5021840	Guys, on the comic, I'll kiss everyone's balls.
5021840	5022840	Just wait.
5022840	5023840	Wait a second.
5023840	5027480	I go on the comic and say, Mercy, would you, will you go kiss the doctor's balls and fucking
5027480	5028840	have him lay low for a second?
5028840	5033920	We had to just kiss everybody's balls so we can just get Anthony Spagulli out of here.
5033920	5034920	Arturo Spagulli.
5034920	5039280	The thing is, it's an empty offer, but it usually works.
5039280	5040280	Why is it an empty offer?
5040280	5045440	Because I don't, I've never actually kissed any balls.
5045440	5047120	Why haven't you kissed any balls before?
5047200	5050040	I, why would anyone just kiss balls?
5050040	5054720	I mean, if anything, it's just a show that I'm subservient and I'm not.
5054720	5056720	I mean, it's just, it's something that turns guys on.
5056720	5059520	I feel like kissing balls is its own reward.
5059520	5061760	Will you show me how to kiss balls?
5061760	5064040	Will you kiss the doctor's balls?
5064040	5066240	Okay, I will.
5066240	5068240	All right.
5071240	5072240	Thank you.
5072240	5075800	But only, okay, I walk up to the doctor and I say, doctor, I'm going to, I'm going to
5075800	5080560	kiss your balls, and I'll, I'm going to do it for one reason, because we're going to
5080560	5089000	find out the importance of kissing balls, the ratio of ball kissing to payoff, where
5089000	5093120	you don't have to jump in and cast agony spells and make any kind of cause.
5093120	5095120	Eve, Eve, Eve, Eve.
5095120	5097960	Woman to woman, you're going to blow my cover.
5097960	5100560	Getting your balls kissed, I don't think is actually that great.
5100560	5105760	It's just something I say, please don't, but don't just, if you start kissing balls,
5105760	5110760	then, then there is the deflation of, but you said you'd never kiss balls before.
5110760	5111760	How do you know what?
5111760	5112760	No, I know.
5112760	5113760	Because I never had to.
5113760	5114760	What if she's good at it?
5114760	5115760	We're not doing this.
5115760	5116760	We have to.
5116760	5117760	We're doing this.
5117760	5120760	I mean, you kiss all the balls you want, but you don't have to do a study about how worthless
5120760	5122760	it is to have your balls kissed.
5122760	5127440	Spencer, is there a way for me and Mercy to talk privately on the comm link, or is it
5127440	5128440	always over the hole?
5128440	5130440	I'm just sensing a lot of chaos.
5130440	5131440	Okay.
5131440	5132440	Mercy, Mercy.
5132440	5133440	What the fuck?
5133440	5134440	Mercy, this is.
5134800	5136800	Mercy, this is Eve on a direct message.
5136800	5137800	Hello.
5137800	5138800	Hey, hi.
5138800	5139800	Mercy?
5139800	5140800	Yeah, yeah.
5140800	5141800	You got me.
5141800	5142800	This is just Eve.
5142800	5143800	I think they went off channel.
5143800	5144800	Can you keep it secret?
5144800	5145800	Yeah, yeah.
5145800	5146800	Girl, if you-
5146800	5148280	You got to promise me, Mercy, you can keep it secret.
5148280	5149280	Yeah, of course.
5149280	5150280	You can't hear me.
5150280	5151280	Check, check.
5151280	5152280	I'm here.
5152280	5153280	I can hear you.
5153280	5154280	Oh, you can hear me?
5154280	5155280	All right.
5155280	5156280	All right.
5156280	5157280	All right.
5157280	5158280	I'm not-
5158280	5159280	Believe me, before they went dark, I heard-
5159280	5160280	On the private life.
5160280	5162280	Mercy, I'm not doing this for you.
5162280	5163280	I'm not doing this for the mission.
5163280	5165720	I'm doing this because I want to kiss the doctor's balls.
5165720	5172120	I think that's beautiful and powerful and I think that's great.
5172120	5175520	And if you don't have to talk to me about it, but if you want to tell me about it, you
5175520	5176520	can.
5176520	5179760	I think I deserve to be heard in this conversation.
5179760	5181440	What if I don't want my balls kissed?
5181440	5184680	What do you get out of it if you do kiss my balls?
5184680	5188120	You can hear them?
5188120	5191160	I just know you get the shame of not taking balls kissed.
5191160	5192160	I go offline.
5192160	5193160	Where am I and where is the doctor?
5194160	5195160	I'm in the car.
5195160	5196160	I'm in the car.
5196160	5201000	I just start kissing the doctor's balls.
5201000	5202000	We're all just in a car, right?
5202000	5204360	Aren't we just in a car?
5204360	5207600	This is like prom night, Milwaukee?
5207600	5213600	Wait, can you explain, did you unzip his pants and then cradle his balls out of his
5213600	5214600	pants?
5214600	5215600	Yes.
5215600	5216600	Precisely.
5216600	5217600	Precisely.
5217600	5219760	What did you do with his dick?
5219760	5220760	Did you touch his dick?
5220760	5222760	The dick has nothing to do with what I'm doing.
5223360	5224360	Is this simply about me?
5224360	5229360	He just fished his balls out like a goldfish bag at a carnival.
5229360	5235360	Hey guys, we're all in the same car.
5235360	5236360	Watch me work.
5236360	5239960	It's one elf, one doctor, two...
5239960	5241160	It's just as rewarding.
5241160	5242160	Two balls.
5242160	5247160	Let me fucking do my thing and I start gently kissing the doctor's balls.
5248160	5252160	I placed my author about 15 minutes ago.
5252160	5255160	I just wanted to get any progress on the back.
5255160	5258160	I would like to take this moment to say that I really appreciate all the work that Spencer
5258160	5261160	does and all the work that he puts into these.
5261160	5262160	Thank you.
5262160	5263160	Thanks.
5263160	5266160	It was a great job.
5266160	5271160	You don't think that when he writes the maps and the descriptions of different rooms and
5271160	5276160	then we spend a half hour kissing balls that he's not like, I got a week off.
5276160	5280160	I'm certain that he's like...
5280160	5281160	It's all good.
5281160	5282160	All right.
5282160	5284160	So I'm kissing the doctor's balls.
5284160	5287160	I mean, yeah, what does the doctor have to say about that, right?
5287160	5289160	Well, I gave up.
5289160	5293160	I thought I had an opinion, but I guess I don't, so I'm just going with it.
5293160	5296160	Doctor, I'm kissing your balls.
5296160	5298160	And it's up to you.
5298160	5300160	Doctor Friend, whether you...
5300160	5304160	I'm just trying to prove a point whether we could have gone and kissed this guy's balls
5304160	5306160	and gone out of here.
5306160	5308160	Wait, you're still...
5308160	5310160	He still insists that there was a point.
5310160	5312160	You said this was about your what and your needs.
5312160	5317160	Guys, truth be told, I just want to kiss his balls.
5317160	5318160	You don't say.
5318160	5319160	I can't.
5319160	5321160	Now I'm just sucking them.
5321160	5323160	Now I'm just fucking...
5323160	5327160	Now I got both balls in my mouth at the same time.
5327160	5328160	And now I'm just fucking...
5328160	5329160	I'm really fucking going at it.
5329160	5333160	I know I'm not on this link, but how is it that you're talking?
5334160	5339160	Can you say what you just said again, but as if you had the doctor's balls in your mouth?
5339160	5341160	With both balls in your mouth.
5341160	5344160	And by both balls, I mean one scrotum.
5354160	5356160	I'm using it in no stuff.
5364160	5365160	Oh!
5376160	5377160	Oh, God.
5380160	5382160	I'm going to make a perimeter.
5382160	5383160	I get out of the car.
5388160	5392160	And there's like a dolly shot of me walking down the street with the car in the background.
5393160	5394160	And I'm just like...
5397160	5398160	Shadow runs.
5398160	5399160	I don't know.
5402160	5404160	It sounds like there are cicadas in the trees.
5409160	5411160	There's too much shadow on this one.
5414160	5416160	Your wife's job are like cicadas.
5416160	5417160	They come every few years.
5417160	5422160	Spencer, while I'm sucking the doctor's balls,
5422160	5425160	I cast a butterfly spell.
5425160	5429160	And I cast two butterflies to tickle both of his balls from the side
5430160	5431160	while I'm sucking his balls.
5432160	5435160	No, no, I start licking his butt, but I cast two butter...
5437160	5439160	I cast two magic butterflies.
5440160	5447160	I cast Force Four butterflies to tickle his balls while I'm licking his balls.
5447160	5449160	Not to overwhelm you, but I find a playground.
5450160	5454160	I got my fingers through the chain link and I'm just watching children play.
5455160	5456160	And I'm just like...
5459160	5465160	And the story on my face is of a man who thought that he knew what darkness was.
5473160	5476160	I cast two Force Four butterflies.
5477160	5482160	Also, don't exhaust the doctor because you might need him to revivify you for further actions.
5483160	5485160	He won't be exhausted. He'll be vivified.
5486160	5488160	Has it been 20 minutes?
5489160	5491160	You know, it has.
5493160	5495160	Strangely enough here, it's my burger.
5496160	5498160	I unconscion the butterflies and go,
5498160	5500160	Guys, let's just fucking get on with it.
5501160	5504160	Just trying to kill some time.
5507160	5513160	Okay, so 20 minutes, as explained, rolls by and yet no one...
5513160	5518160	Actually, no, 20 minutes can't go by because you're still being held up by the fry cooks, Demours.
5518160	5520160	You have guns pointed at you still.
5520160	5523160	That hasn't been happening for 20 minutes. That'd be ridiculous.
5524160	5527160	So what are you doing with these guns pointed at you?
5527160	5529160	Let me use the mind probe.
5529160	5533160	Oh, Jesus. Listen, man, do I understand what's going on?
5533160	5535160	I think you're at a playground.
5535160	5538160	Well, yeah, but I mean, can I hear?
5539160	5541160	All right, okay.
5542160	5545160	Hey, guys, where's Nightblade? Where'd he go?
5545160	5546160	I'm at a playground.
5546160	5547160	Why are you at a playground?
5547160	5553160	Because for the sake of balance, man, fucking tonal balance.
5554160	5556160	I was about to balance his balls with two butterflies.
5556160	5559160	Yeah, and I'm balancing your balancing, man.
5559160	5561160	You guys, come on under Shadow Run.
5561160	5564160	Come on, we'll go make some BTL chips.
5565160	5568160	Ball-licking shit.
5570160	5575160	Hey, Hornet guy, there's an anti-gun rule at the Burger Tower.
5575160	5577160	You got to get out of there and give your guns to the guy.
5577160	5578160	This is true.
5580160	5584160	Without turning my back on the individuals with guns pulled,
5584160	5589160	hands raised, yes, I walk backwards.
5589160	5591160	I walk backwards.
5591160	5593160	I give them a smile.
5593160	5596160	It's very difficult for me, so I'll need the doctor later.
5596160	5599160	Can we see that smile?
5606160	5607160	Yeah, that happens.
5607160	5608160	You walk out of the Burger Tower.
5608160	5611160	And I'm saying to them, gentlemen, gentlemen,
5611160	5613160	and I'm taking as long time as I can
5613160	5615160	because I've also ordered a burger.
5615160	5617160	Well, you haven't.
5617160	5619160	You can't order a burger with weapons.
5619160	5620160	They're not letting you.
5620160	5622160	I'm backing out of the place.
5622160	5624160	You back out successfully.
5624160	5626160	I am outside of the place.
5626160	5627160	You sure are.
5627160	5630160	How are we time-wise with the 20 minutes?
5630160	5633160	20 minutes passes, and no one comes out.
5633160	5636160	You think maybe something's gone awry.
5636160	5640160	Mercy, didn't he say that he was going to come out
5640160	5642160	if he looked at his balls or kissed his balls?
5642160	5643160	Look, I know you're high and mighty
5643160	5645160	because you got to look at some balls.
5645160	5648160	No, he has not come out.
5648160	5649160	He has not come out.
5649160	5650160	All right, I'm going to go check the back.
5650160	5652160	I'm at a playground.
5652160	5653160	What?
5653160	5655160	I run back into the restaurant.
5655160	5656160	Okay.
5656160	5657160	What's going on in there?
5657160	5659160	Just nothing.
5659160	5660160	He's sitting.
5660160	5661160	He's done eating.
5661160	5662160	Okay.
5662160	5663160	He's reading a newspaper.
5663160	5665160	Oh, oh, my God.
5665160	5669160	There are two girls that were in a car accident outside.
5669160	5670160	Oh, no.
5670160	5672160	Were those those two girls that wanted me
5672160	5673160	for your bachelor party?
5673160	5674160	No, no, no.
5674160	5676160	Two children, two children got in a car accident.
5676160	5679160	We all watched them, and we're too drunk to help them.
5679160	5681160	Please, please come help.
5681160	5683160	Doesn't sound like my bag.
5683160	5687160	What a fucking asshole.
5687160	5689160	I'm going to head to the burger tyrant
5689160	5691160	from the playground, but going around,
5691160	5693160	is there a back entrance?
5693160	5695160	There is, but it seems super locked.
5695160	5696160	Yeah.
5696160	5698160	Wait, this guy won't come out
5698160	5700160	for two children in a car accident?
5700160	5702160	No, he's a mobster.
5702160	5703160	And it's the future.
5703160	5704160	Mobster?
5704160	5706160	If you think the present is selfish.
5706160	5707160	Right.
5707160	5711160	But if I've learned anything from grandfather,
5711160	5713160	the godfather.
5719160	5721160	I'm sorry.
5721160	5722160	That is an accident.
5722160	5725160	But the godfather, he was so grand, wasn't he?
5725160	5728160	That was the mafia in the 70s.
5728160	5731160	Like, I mean, it's only gotten worse.
5731160	5734160	The burgers he's eating are probably made of children.
5734160	5735160	Well, they're krill protein.
5735160	5736160	Too soon.
5737160	5740160	But organized crime is all about code, right?
5740160	5742160	And you protect children.
5742160	5743160	You protect the little girls.
5743160	5744160	And they have dances.
5744160	5746160	And you have to buy their dresses.
5746160	5748160	The organized crime movies that we've seen
5748160	5750160	play out a particular story,
5750160	5751160	which is that organized crime,
5751160	5753160	much like capitalism itself,
5753160	5756160	is slowly eroded by its own code,
5756160	5758160	which is profit above all else.
5758160	5762160	So what starts as the black hand in Sicily
5762160	5764160	that becomes La Cosa Nostra
5764160	5767160	turns into just a bunch of business people.
5767160	5768160	Okay, okay.
5768160	5770160	I walk out and I come back in again
5770160	5773160	and I say, two Ponzi schemes got in a car accident.
5775160	5776160	Oh, that's crazy.
5776160	5778160	Can I use my grapple gun
5778160	5781160	to Batman up to the roof of the burger tyrant?
5781160	5782160	Yeah.
5782160	5785160	I mean, you laugh, but this is my style.
5785160	5786160	I get it.
5786160	5787160	This is what I do.
5787160	5788160	That's why I laugh.
5788160	5789160	I'm like a cat.
5789160	5790160	I find higher ground.
5790160	5793160	I come down from up above.
5793160	5794160	So let me know when I'm up there.
5794160	5796160	Let me know what my options are.
5796160	5797160	You're up there.
5797160	5801160	It's there's some small fist size pipes for ventilation.
5802160	5804160	Yeah, not people sized.
5804160	5805160	All right.
5805160	5806160	Nothing.
5806160	5807160	Nothing cinematically sized.
5808160	5809160	No, I'm afraid not.
5809160	5810160	All right.
5810160	5811160	Fine.
5811160	5812160	Going back down.
5814160	5815160	Oh, okay.
5815160	5816160	Reality check.
5818160	5819160	Trope called.
5819160	5821160	Well, it's it's the, you know,
5821160	5824160	it's not much ventilation in a burger tyrant.
5824160	5825160	Of course not.
5825160	5826160	Where would there be?
5826160	5827160	I don't know.
5827160	5833160	Would it be well prohibitive for me to use my other
5833160	5836160	and alternate identity as a security guard?
5836160	5838160	Yeah, but you still look the same.
5838160	5839160	Exactly.
5839160	5842160	So secondly, is it possible that the doctor could give me
5842160	5843160	another skin?
5844160	5845160	I don't.
5845160	5847160	I think the troll skin is just something he has.
5847160	5849160	If he if he could disguise.
5849160	5850160	I go in the common.
5850160	5851160	Can I ask our whole team?
5851160	5854160	Why is it so hard to get one guy out of a fucking burger place?
5854160	5856160	It's not a helpful question.
5856160	5857160	I have.
5859160	5862160	We have to be able to get one guy out of a burger place.
5862160	5865160	Let's let's just muscle up and go get this guy.
5865160	5867160	How do I use my organized script?
5867160	5870160	My organized crime skill to get him out.
5870160	5872160	Can I use that also under qualities?
5872160	5874160	It says moderate egg allergy.
5874160	5875160	That's not a quality.
5876160	5879160	That is absolutely a quality.
5879160	5881160	It's what made me want to work for you.
5882160	5885160	I want to when I get a turn.
5885160	5886160	What was the other question?
5886160	5887160	Organized crime.
5887160	5889160	How do I use my organized crime skills?
5889160	5892160	You can use your knowledge of organized crime to learn stuff.
5892160	5893160	I mean, what do you want to learn about?
5893160	5894160	Can I use that?
5894160	5896160	I want to learn how to lure this guy outside.
5898160	5900160	Using my organized crime knowledge.
5900160	5901160	Nothing.
5901160	5903160	That's like looking up a walk through for a video game.
5904160	5905160	What?
5907160	5909160	Moderate egg allergy.
5909160	5917160	Would it be possible for me to inflict the agony spell on you,
5917160	5920160	not the guys with the guns, but on you.
5920160	5921160	The dungeon master?
5922160	5923160	Not you.
5923160	5924160	Not you.
5924160	5926160	But the guy we're trying to get out.
5926160	5927160	Sure.
5927160	5931160	I put the agony spell on him when he goes down screaming in agony.
5931160	5934160	I come rushing in saying, I'm a doctor.
5934160	5935160	Get out of the way.
5935160	5936160	Yeah.
5936160	5937160	There we go.
5939160	5941160	Now we're fucking talking.
5941160	5943160	That's what I'm talking about.
5943160	5946160	So I, I put the spell on him.
5947160	5948160	How does that go?
5948160	5950160	I mean, let's not because he's yours.
5950160	5953160	Let's not shortchange the audience on the agony spell inside.
5954160	5959160	So I roll down the window of the of the truck.
5959160	5961160	Actually, do you mind if I can I hold on?
5961160	5963160	I mean, I just want to get this on video.
5964160	5965160	We're recording.
5965160	5966160	Oh yeah, I know.
5966160	5968160	But not from this angle.
5968160	5969160	Okay.
5969160	5970160	Okay.
5981160	5987160	You fire off the agony spell and it lances through the window and hits him right in his dumb suit.
5988160	5992160	He goes down a righty thing around in what looks like agony.
5992160	5994160	Isn't there a verbal component to the spell though?
5994160	5996160	I feel like there's a verbal component.
5996160	5998160	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
6001160	6002160	Ramana.
6004160	6006160	Usama.
6009160	6010160	All right.
6010160	6011160	Is that good?
6011160	6015160	I just, I guess I, I guess I should just let things that make me happy go.
6016160	6017160	I just remember that first week.
6017160	6018160	You just going.
6019160	6022160	Oh, I don't remember that.
6022160	6023160	But anyway.
6023160	6024160	Okay.
6026160	6027160	No, that was, that's much better.
6027160	6028160	And here I am.
6029160	6030160	Whatever it is.
6030160	6031160	So, okay.
6031160	6032160	So it's done.
6032160	6034160	He's down on the floor in agony.
6034160	6035160	Yes.
6037160	6039160	I'm a doctor out of the way.
6039160	6040160	Let him breathe.
6040160	6041160	Are you carrying your weapons?
6041160	6042160	No, I'm not.
6042160	6044160	I'm carrying my bag.
6044160	6045160	All right.
6045160	6046160	Fair enough.
6046160	6048160	So I kneel down.
6048160	6050160	I give him an injection.
6050160	6052160	He passes out.
6054160	6055160	I need help.
6055160	6060160	Somebody, you men with guns, help me get him out to our truck.
6060160	6062160	I'll get him to the hospital.
6062160	6063160	Oh.
6064160	6065160	Yeah.
6065160	6066160	Yeah.
6066160	6067160	We'll help you out.
6067160	6068160	Okay.
6068160	6069160	We'll help you right out.
6069160	6073160	In the meantime, run to the van and bring it to this, this, this, this portal.
6074160	6075160	The what?
6075160	6076160	The door to bring it.
6076160	6077160	Oh yeah.
6077160	6078160	Just like bring it up.
6078160	6079160	Bring it around.
6079160	6080160	Okay.
6080160	6081160	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6081160	6082160	The restaurant, a portal.
6082160	6083160	It's a portal.
6083160	6084160	Yeah.
6084160	6085160	Yeah.
6085160	6086160	Technically.
6086160	6087160	Yeah.
6087160	6088160	Okay.
6088160	6089160	I want to try to pick the lock on the back door.
6089160	6090160	Okay.
6091160	6093160	Just because I'm a completist.
6093160	6096160	With, with, with just a lock pick.
6096160	6098160	I, I go, I go to the playground.
6100160	6103160	I want to find out what all the fuss is about over that flag.
6105160	6108160	I go to the back and I, and I start painting myself with cold grease.
6113160	6114160	I'm sorry.
6114160	6115160	That's what I did.
6115160	6116160	I'm sorry.
6116160	6117160	That's what I do.
6117160	6119160	I can't, I can't wait to go to Arby's after the show.
6119160	6120160	We can do that.
6121160	6122160	She did.
6127160	6130160	That's the greatest sidebar in RPG history.
6131160	6133160	I guess I do know what you said that reminded me of that.
6133160	6135160	Just covering yourself in grease.
6135160	6137160	I was like, I can't wait to go to Arby's.
6137160	6138160	I love you so much.
6141160	6142160	Enabling.
6142160	6143160	We just rub pizza.
6143160	6144160	Pizza.
6147160	6150160	Just watch empire, which is a pepperoni dripping out of the face.
6151160	6152160	All right.
6152160	6153160	All right.
6153160	6154160	But let's finish this off.
6154160	6155160	Chris.
6155160	6158160	You can't pick the lock because it's, it's not a pickable lock.
6158160	6159160	It's one of them mag locks.
6159160	6160160	Story of my life.
6160160	6161160	All right.
6161160	6162160	Let's go.
6162160	6163160	All right.
6163160	6165160	The van, the truck comes around it.
6165160	6166160	Uh, yeah.
6166160	6168160	Well, I guess it's a car, whatever.
6168160	6169160	It comes around.
6169160	6172160	Um, you, you and the, the thug guys.
6172160	6177160	They drag the unconscious friend out, uh, or not friend Arturo out into the
6177160	6180160	street where they just kind of leave them.
6180160	6181160	They don't care so much.
6181160	6184160	They just kind of drop them outside and go back, back inside.
6184160	6185160	Oh, that's nice.
6185160	6186160	Okay.
6186160	6187160	So we lift them up into the truck.
6187160	6188160	Okay.
6188160	6189160	That happens.
6189160	6190160	I leave the door open.
6190160	6191160	I jump out.
6191160	6192160	The car is still running.
6192160	6195160	I help assist in this loading him into.
6195160	6196160	I head back around front.
6196160	6198160	So Arturo has passed out.
6198160	6199160	Yeah.
6199160	6200160	Okay.
6200160	6201160	I unzip his pants.
6202160	6203160	There's no need to.
6203160	6205160	I make sure this is me.
6205160	6206160	There's no code.
6206160	6207160	I make sure that no one's around.
6207160	6208160	A deal is a deal.
6208160	6211160	I just want to know what it's like.
6211160	6214160	I just want to know what it's like.
6214160	6217160	So I, I fish out his balls like a bag.
6217160	6219160	There are people around though.
6219160	6220160	What the fuck?
6220160	6223160	There are people, there are people around.
6223160	6227160	I'm walking back from the playground back to the car and I see this happening and
6227160	6231160	I, and I, I'm starting to thumbs up it.
6232160	6234160	What are you doing?
6234160	6236160	Well, people are around.
6236160	6238160	I wanted it to just be my own self discovery.
6238160	6239160	Mercy.
6239160	6240160	Mercy.
6240160	6241160	Yeah.
6241160	6242160	Who?
6242160	6243160	What?
6243160	6244160	I'm awake.
6244160	6245160	I must've been daydreaming.
6245160	6246160	Mercy.
6246160	6247160	What?
6247160	6248160	What?
6248160	6249160	I'm holding balls.
6249160	6250160	I put them back inside.
6250160	6251160	I zip it up.
6251160	6252160	Huh.
6252160	6253160	Sorry.
6253160	6254160	Sometimes I have dreams.
6254160	6255160	This is all something I've seen before.
6255160	6258160	So I leave and I'm in the driver's seat waiting to drive away.
6258160	6259160	Hey, listen, man.
6259160	6264160	I gotta tell you guys, like I go on shadow runs because I'm a wanted man without a
6264160	6266160	past, no future.
6266160	6268160	This ball shit.
6268160	6272160	It's like a whole different level for me.
6272160	6275160	You're asking me to go deeper and like darker.
6275160	6276160	All right.
6276160	6279160	Well, nightplay, why don't you give us a list of your limitations and we'll try to
6279160	6280160	follow it.
6280160	6282160	I have to high road me when you're the one.
6282160	6286160	I only prefer the ball knowing right now that we have our tourists.
6286160	6290160	We're almost done accomplishing our mission just for fun.
6290160	6291160	This was an easy one.
6291160	6292160	Yeah.
6292160	6295160	I cast force force stun bolts on night blade.
6295160	6296160	What the fuck?
6296160	6301160	They unzip his pants and conjure two butterflies.
6301160	6302160	What?
6302160	6306160	Hordegar puts the car in park.
6306160	6307160	Cliff Hager.
6307160	6308160	What?
6308160	6309160	All right.
6309160	6314160	Thanks, Curtis Armstrong, for coming back.
6314160	6315160	Curtis Armstrong, everybody.

6326160	6332160	Your mayor, Dan Harmon, everybody.
6332160	6337160	We didn't get a whole lot done, but we asked a lot of questions.
6337160	6338160	Happy Easter.
6338160	6340160	Happy birthday, Jesus.
6340160	6343160	It's not his birthday.
6343160	6344160	Isn't it?
6344160	6346160	It's just coming out.
6349160	6351160	Did you get any of that?
6351160	6354160	It's a good show.
