0	25200	From Chicago.
25200	29200	My hometown.
29200	35200	The home of the greatest football team in the world.
35200	40200	The Chicago Fuckheads.
40200	45200	Look, you know, you got cocky, you know.
45200	49200	I would have said something nice if you didn't, but you know, you were fooling yourselves.
49200	52200	So fuck you.
52200	64200	It's Herman Jones!
64200	68200	I am the ugly Jeff Davis.
68200	75200	And now, for your listening pleasure, Daniel...
105200	120200	The gayest nerd ever.
120200	122200	Hi.
122200	126200	So did you notice something special about the show's format tonight?
126200	128200	Yeah, we got a fucking real organist.
128200	133200	Yeah!
133200	135200	So, this guy...
135200	138200	No, you've been here for years, right?
138200	140200	Like, how many years?
140200	142200	Ninety-two.
142200	145200	And what's the name again? Sorry, it's Dennis Scott.
145200	147200	I knew it sounded like a fake name.
147200	153200	Dennis Scott, previously a real name, wanted in three states,
153200	159200	but now creating a new life as of 92, as an organist in a theater.
159200	163200	Dennis Scott.
163200	166200	No such lineage, ever.
166200	171200	Pick a first name and then give us a last name, for God's sake.
171200	178200	Dennis Scott, yeah, he's an icon here at this 1929...
178200	181200	This theater.
181200	183200	I used to come here and watch movies.
183200	187200	I came here, I invited a bunch of friends over one Christmas Eve.
187200	191200	It was December 23rd, and I invited all my friends to come and watch
191200	193200	It's a Wonderful Life here.
193200	197200	And no one came.
197200	202200	And it was me looking at the screen,
202200	205200	and at the end when it said,
205200	214200	No man is a failure who has friends.
214200	220200	The first night of my life.
220200	225200	Dennis Scott's shift usually ends an hour ago.
225200	228200	I kicked some money in.
228200	231200	I thought it would be fun to have him here for a Harman Town show.
231200	234200	It is? Yeah!
234200	239200	So for instance, if we were to say,
239200	245200	Oh, it's time for Adino to tell us about the craziest sexual thing he's ever done.
245200	247200	Do do do.
247200	248200	Do do do do.
248200	250200	My mom's in the audience.
250200	252200	My mom's in...
252200	254200	Oh, that's true. Yeah, sorry.
254200	257200	I do have a couple rules because my mom's in the audience.
257200	258200	Oh, okay.
258200	260200	I have a few things.
260200	264200	It's time for Adino's rules segment.
264200	268200	Yeah.
268200	271200	The saddest segment ever.
271200	275200	So there's a few things that we can't say on this show.
275200	278200	First thing, cunt.
278200	280200	Can't say cunt.
280200	281200	Just in general?
281200	284200	Don't say cunt at all.
284200	287200	We can't say your mom's a cunt.
287200	292200	I don't know about that.
292200	293200	Mostly cunt.
293200	296200	I mean, there's certain variables involved.
297200	306200	She probably doesn't like cuntiness or cunt load or cunt organ.
306200	314200	We were at dinner at a fine Greek restaurant today.
314200	322200	I went and joined Dino and his family, including his mother, who is wonderful.
322200	323200	80 years old.
324200	327200	81. She'll make you remember.
327200	329200	You wouldn't know it from talking to her.
329200	335200	She's got all the pluck of Christian Slater from Heathers.
335200	339200	That's what I actually picture when I'm talking to her.
339200	342200	Guess the one person who doesn't understand that joke here.
342200	344200	Exactly. I love it.
344200	348200	But she loves me and I love her.
348200	350200	You call her mamatopolis.
350200	352200	I call her mamatopolis.
352200	354200	Because I can never remember her first name.
354200	356200	Tula. Tula.
358200	361200	Oh, he doesn't give a shit about her first name.
361200	366200	But tonight Dino's like a thousand years old.
366200	369200	I'm turning 50 this year.
369200	371200	It's the new 30.
371200	373200	It's the new sexy.
373200	378200	Tonight, tonight, for the first time in his 50-year life,
378200	381200	sitting next to his mom at a Greek restaurant in Chicago...
381200	383200	She screamed this.
383200	387200	Dino was razzing his mom, as he often does.
387200	389200	Oh, mom, you're a piece of shit.
389200	391200	You're whatever.
391200	393200	Oh, mom.
393200	396200	And tonight, for the first time ever...
396200	398200	Ever. I swear to God.
398200	402200	Your mom spun toward you and pointed a finger at you and said,
402200	404200	You were a mistake.
412200	414200	Which is amazing.
414200	419200	The thing that was amazing to me is that it took her that long to tell you that.
419200	423200	Because my mom told me that as soon as I learned the words,
423200	426200	You were and mistake.
426200	429200	No, she was winding up for the big one.
429200	436200	She knew she had a fucking moment where I was going to give her shit a lot.
436200	438200	And it was tonight.
438200	441200	I love that there was some fracas there,
441200	443200	and then your brother was also at the table,
443200	445200	and he's older than you, right?
445200	447200	No, he's two years younger.
447200	448200	Oh, okay.
448200	451200	Well, his ponytail's grayer.
451200	454200	And then at a certain point, she wheeled at him and said,
454200	456200	You were a mistake, too.
456200	460200	I know. She's really... I think she screamed, You were a mistake.
460200	463200	You are all mistakes here to my mom.
463200	467200	I love that if you live long enough as a woman,
467200	470200	that is actually your right.
470200	473200	You get to go, You're all a fucking mistake.
473200	477200	Because it occurred to me when she said that,
477200	484200	that Yahweh was saying that to Adam and Eve.
484200	490200	And that humankind, whether you believe in Darwin's version of the species development
490200	493200	or in a fundamentalist principle,
493200	495200	both agree on one thing.
495200	498200	We are a mistake.
498200	501200	And that's a profound thing.
501200	505200	Who here wants to be the result of a divine plan?
505200	508200	That's dumb. That's stupid.
508200	513200	Here are some things that are the result of a blot of planning.
513200	517200	Aftermash.
517200	519200	Ah, good organ.
519200	527200	All the time of the world to think of that one.
527200	531200	The organ guy.
531200	534200	What is his name? Dick Wolf?
534200	537200	Dick Wolf on organ.
537200	541200	Second thing we can't say, fart.
541200	543200	I just want to get out of my system.
543200	545200	I want to rap.
545200	548200	We got to try it.
548200	551200	Can you just like, let's just take anything with a steady tempo.
551200	563200	Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
563200	566200	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
566200	569200	Rapping to the organ because the beat is my own.
569200	571200	I fucked your mama so hard.
571200	573200	She tried to call me on the phone.
573200	577200	I said, I can't talk to you. I'm calling you back.
577200	582200	I fucked your mama so hard that her heart got a crack.
582200	586200	I put my dick in the crack and I made it extra wide.
586200	588200	I fucked your mama so hard.
588200	594200	She said, bye. Oh, my. Oh, my.
594200	600200	I fucked your mama.
600200	603200	I fucked your mama.
603200	608200	1929.
608200	611200	It's raining pennies. I fucked your mama.
611200	615200	The depression fucked your mama.
615200	619200	I fucked your mama. All right. All right.
619200	623200	I think.
623200	628200	Thanks, kids. Thanks.
629200	633200	I hate to bring this up now, but number three is fucked your mama.
633200	636200	We can't say that at all.
636200	639200	Number four, don't say Jesus sucked a cock.
639200	642200	She's very religious. She's Greek Orthodox.
642200	647200	I get weirded out when I hear that. And I hate Jesus.
647200	650200	So I heard a story.
650200	654200	Okay. Well, we'll get back to the list later.
654200	659200	That's my only written bit.
659200	662200	Oh.
662200	666200	Are we going to watch Nosferatu?
666200	668200	I.
668200	673200	There was somebody that told me a story in the community writers room that
673200	678200	that there was a person who like I guess this must happen all the time.
678200	681200	And I'm worried because there's probably 800 people here that this happened to
681200	684200	them.
684200	691200	Every once in a while, a grandparent kills a kid.
695200	701200	I don't know how much you paid him, but money well spent.
701200	707200	Every once in a while in America somewhere,
707200	712200	a father of 35 who has a two year old child leaves his
712200	715200	child in the care of his 70 year old.
715200	717200	Oh, so it's my mistake. It's not.
717200	720200	No, it's not premeditated. It's not underworld.
720200	722200	Yeah.
722200	723200	I don't know.
723200	725200	Can you, can you imagine, I just want to imagine like,
725200	729200	like everyone here in this room is like in some state of either hating their
729200	733200	parents or hope or having their own kids.
733200	735200	There is never any in between.
735200	740200	Can you imagine like if you were like, okay, I fucking hate my parents,
740200	742200	but I have my own kid.
742200	744200	Mom, will you babysit the kid?
744200	745200	I got to go to work.
745200	749200	And then you come home and your mom is like, I killed your kid.
749200	750200	Yeah.
750200	754200	No, I, I agree. I'd be the worst grandparent.
754200	758200	Once I got drunk, I'd be time to hold the baby.
758200	761200	But I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm thinking they were talking about that
761200	773200	writer's room. And I said, I actually got excited because I was like,
773200	777200	did you, did you give them $5,000 really?
777200	779200	Yeah.
779200	783200	This guy's working overtime.
783200	787200	I actually picture if my mom killed my kid, I,
787200	790200	there was a little bit of excitement
790200	795200	because I was like, I could kill my mom.
795200	799200	And while I was killing her, I could be like,
799200	802200	I'm not going to hell for this.
802200	805200	Do you love Greek tragedies?
805200	809200	It was worth it. I'll have another kid.
809200	812200	But this one's not on me.
812200	813200	I don't know.
813200	816200	You wouldn't feel that way. You'd love your kid.
816200	817200	Sorry.
817200	822200	I'd love my kid and I'd cash that love in for an opportunity to kill my mother.
822200	826200	I'd have another kid free of her influence.
826200	832200	You're better than me. I would, I would, I would just be sad.
832200	834200	Your mom mentioned something tonight.
834200	835200	Yeah.
835200	836200	At the dinner table.
836200	839200	Oh, I have another word we can't say.
839200	841200	Cunt.
841200	843200	Did I say that already?
843200	848200	She doesn't mind cunt face for some reason.
848200	852200	Yeah, that was a little, yeah.
852200	854200	Wait till you hear the next one.
854200	857200	It's a biggie.
857200	860200	Your mom said she had the gout at one point.
860200	861200	Oh yeah.
861200	864200	And I wanted to bring her up and ask her about the gout.
864200	865200	She doesn't want to come up.
865200	868200	I know she doesn't want to come up, but I want to know about the gout.
868200	869200	I'll tell you all about it.
869200	870200	What's the gout?
870200	874200	The gout is when you eat rich food, your, your, your foot swells up and you can't,
874200	875200	you can't even put a little sheet.
875200	879200	You can't put like a, like a tissue on it because it hurts so much.
879200	880200	Jesus.
880200	881200	It hurts so bad, right?
881200	882200	Do you have the gout?
882200	883200	Come up here.
883200	888200	Can you come up and talk about your gout?
888200	890200	He's got the gout. He's got the gout.
890200	891200	He's got the gout.
891200	893200	It's buckets from heaven.
893200	898200	When it rains, I've got it going to the downtown.
898200	903200	I'm putting on my gout hat and my tail coats and my rhinestone monocle.
903200	907200	I'm going to see King Kong kill photographers.
907200	908200	Hey.
908200	909200	Yep.
909200	910200	Dep.
910200	911200	Dep.
911200	912200	Dep.
912200	913200	Dep.
913200	914200	Dep.
914200	915200	Dep.
915200	916200	Dep.
916200	917200	Dep.
917200	918200	Dep.
918200	919200	Dep.
919200	920200	Dep.
920200	921200	Dep.
921200	922200	Dep.
922200	923200	Dep.
923200	924200	Dep.
924200	925200	Dep.
925200	926200	Dep.
926200	927200	Dep.
927200	928200	It's too tall in a order.
928200	931200	Just have the gout and talk to us about it.
931200	933200	Do you need to sit down percocAY?
933200	934200	Is that part of the gout?
934200	935200	Hey, where's the vodka?
935200	936200	By the way.
936200	937200	What the fuck is going on with it?
937200	938200	It was too much to ask.
938200	940200	Too much for Chicago.
940200	944200	This is my home goddamn town.
944200	948200	Where's the catal eggs?
948200	953200	I don't understand what I'm supposed to do with the stage to make him stop doing that.
953200	959200	I feel like I'm just learning the force.
959200	964200	No, Luke, don't put the red one near the blue one.
964200	965200	That's complicated.
965200	967200	I thought I was supposed to open my mind.
967200	968200	All right, what's the gout?
968200	969200	What is it?
969200	973200	So it's, I mean, you know what's right?
973200	977200	It starts with, like, rich food, beef, chicken.
977200	978200	What does rich mean?
978200	979200	Rich means anything.
979200	981200	Well, the gout was originally like a rich person.
981200	983200	Back in ancient Greece and stuff, it was like a rich person.
983200	987200	The people who would get it were people who could afford to be fat.
987200	991200	So, like, you know, I got the gout.
991200	992200	That's pretty much us.
992200	993200	Yeah.
993200	995200	So, like, saturated fat?
995200	997200	Yeah, it's all...
997200	1000200	It's healthy fat.
1000200	1001200	Yeah, uric acid builds up in your...
1001200	1004200	Get up here.
1004200	1008200	Everyone who has an opinion, get up here.
1008200	1009200	You have a gout support group.
1009200	1012200	So the gout, then, it collects in your foot?
1012200	1013200	Yeah.
1013200	1014200	So it can happen.
1014200	1017200	A lot of people get it in their elbow, but mine happens to be in both my feet.
1017200	1021200	My theory is that if you don't walk around a lot and you're a truck driver, you get gout
1021200	1023200	in your ass.
1023200	1024200	Like, you get hemorrhoids.
1024200	1026200	Hemorrhoids is the same as gout.
1026200	1027200	You're the same?
1027200	1029200	Is that idiotic?
1029200	1030200	Your theory...
1030200	1031200	We have a guy with a gout.
1031200	1032200	I'm not a doctor.
1032200	1033200	He's not a doctor either.
1033200	1035200	But he's the next best thing to a doctor.
1035200	1036200	He's the guy who had gout.
1036200	1037200	He's the guy who had gout.
1037200	1038200	He's the guy with gout.
1038200	1039200	All right.
1039200	1040200	I'm the guy with gout.
1040200	1041200	I have a mom with gout.
1041200	1043200	So the only way you learn is by bouncing it off me.
1043200	1044200	I can say, no, Dina.
1044200	1045200	So what happens?
1045200	1046200	So really, it's not...
1046200	1047200	So it's pain?
1047200	1048200	So it's every...
1048200	1051200	Well, first of all, the terrible thing is you go to the doctor and you're like, my foot
1051200	1052200	hurts.
1052200	1054200	And I have a microfracture and he's like, no, you have gout.
1054200	1056200	And I was like, okay, so what can I take to get rid of?
1056200	1057200	He's like, no, no, it's with you for life.
1057200	1058200	This is good.
1058200	1059200	No, but you take pills, right?
1059200	1060200	No.
1060200	1061200	Yeah, my mom takes pills.
1062200	1063200	My mom takes pills.
1063200	1064200	Okay.
1064200	1065200	Jesus Christ.
1065200	1066200	To ease the pain.
1066200	1069200	Stop arguing with him.
1069200	1072200	I wish she had the fucking courage to get up here.
1072200	1073200	Your foot hurt.
1073200	1074200	And so the doctor says, you have gout.
1074200	1075200	You have it for life?
1075200	1076200	Yeah.
1076200	1079200	And you get flare ups, like herpes.
1079200	1081200	But what is it?
1081200	1083200	Now you want to fight.
1083200	1084200	It's not even...
1084200	1085200	It doesn't swell really bad.
1085200	1087200	It's not noticeably red.
1087200	1088200	It's just you can't...
1088200	1089200	It's the worst...
1089200	1090200	I've broken bones up.
1090200	1092200	It feels as bad as that.
1092200	1093200	And you just can't...
1093200	1095200	I can't walk for like a week, two weeks.
1095200	1096200	Because what's happening?
1096200	1101200	Uric acid builds up and it crystallizes in your bones and in your muscles.
1101200	1102200	Oh.
1102200	1105200	And so it just makes it like sharp shooting pain.
1105200	1107200	Can't you just drink some water, walk it off or something?
1107200	1108200	I do.
1108200	1112200	Well, I sit on my couch with like an ice pack and play FIFA for like a week.
1112200	1113200	White people problem.
1113200	1114200	I know.
1115200	1116200	All right.
1116200	1117200	Well...
1119200	1120200	Get up here.
1120200	1122200	No, don't tell him to get up here.
1122200	1124200	No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
1124200	1125200	Now he's coming up.
1125200	1126200	I'm not in control.
1126200	1127200	No, no, no, no.
1127200	1128200	Come on.
1128200	1129200	You already stood up.
1129200	1130200	Come on.
1130200	1133200	We got a lot of people coming up.
1133200	1134200	I'll step down.
1134200	1139200	If you talk, you get to come on up, cabaret.
1139200	1143200	If you speak, you get to come on up.
1143200	1151200	If you have a mouth, then come on up, cabaret.
1151200	1155200	This has to do with German politics.
1155200	1158200	I do not know the meaning.
1158200	1161200	I'm cabaret.
1161200	1164200	Cabaret.
1164200	1168200	If you speak, you get to come on up.
1168200	1169200	Oh, okay.
1169200	1172200	I hate Tim Burton more than anyone.
1172200	1173200	All right.
1173200	1174200	What's your name, young man?
1174200	1175200	Tim Farrell.
1175200	1176200	Tim Carl?
1176200	1177200	Farrell.
1177200	1178200	Tim Farrell.
1178200	1179200	All right.
1179200	1181200	Another fake name.
1181200	1183200	Uric acid, go.
1183200	1186200	Basically, your kidneys don't filter correctly,
1186200	1189200	so you end up building uric acid crystals in your joints
1189200	1190200	and in your muscles.
1190200	1194200	So it's like having little tiny daggers in your joints.
1194200	1196200	Okay, step down.
1196200	1200200	Step down and you came up for a second.
1200200	1205200	And now I think I reckon you'll go back down
1205200	1211200	and sit there and be an audience member.
1211200	1214200	Tiny daggers.
1214200	1216200	All right, tiny daggers.
1216200	1219200	I like Tim Burton now.
1219200	1221200	That kid was probably like a pre-med student.
1221200	1223200	He probably had the most answers.
1223200	1226200	How long has your mom had Gout?
1226200	1228200	How long has your mom had Gout?
1228200	1229200	How long has she had...
1229200	1230200	How long, yeah.
1230200	1231200	I don't know.
1231200	1236200	How long have you had Gout?
1236200	1238200	Forget it.
1238200	1239200	I was worried it killed her.
1239200	1240200	She didn't answer.
1240200	1243200	Can you look at her after the show?
1243200	1244200	You're a doctor, right?
1244200	1245200	No, no.
1245200	1247200	What are you doing here?
1247200	1248200	I'm a fundraiser.
1248200	1250200	All right, let's have a hand for Goutman.
1250200	1253200	Yeah!
1253200	1256200	You and Gout.
1256200	1260200	Now we understand Gout.
1260200	1267200	Everybody understands Gout better now.
1267200	1268200	The N-bomb.
1268200	1270200	My mom hates the N-bomb.
1270200	1271200	Oh, yeah?
1271200	1272200	What's the N-bomb?
1272200	1273200	Hates it.
1273200	1274200	Hates the N-bomb.
1274200	1275200	Who doesn't?
1275200	1277200	Who doesn't hate the N-bomb?
1277200	1278200	I agree.
1278200	1279200	She doesn't mind the word nigger though,
1279200	1284200	but she hates N-bomb.
1284200	1286200	It's a silly joke.
1286200	1288200	You made a silly joke.
1288200	1289200	I wrote one joke.
1289200	1291200	And you knew you could get away with it
1291200	1293200	because we're in Chicago and they're...
1293200	1300200	Chicago loves me!
1300200	1302200	All right, society corner.
1302200	1303200	Oh.
1303200	1304200	Okay.
1304200	1305200	I don't know what this is.
1305200	1307200	When you're flying on a plane.
1308200	1311200	I understand that I've done it too.
1311200	1313200	Sometimes you take off your shoes
1313200	1320200	because the shoes cover the sock-covered feet.
1320200	1325200	And the sock-covered feet are, you know, your shoes.
1325200	1327200	Oh, boy, I've had these shoes on for so long.
1327200	1328200	And you're on a plane.
1328200	1329200	It's your right.
1329200	1331200	Like, Jesus Christ, I'm on the plane for six hours.
1331200	1332200	Take off your shoes.
1332200	1336200	You get your little sock feet tucked under the seat in front of you.
1336200	1342200	Who are these people that then take off the socks?
1342200	1345200	And everyone in this room has been on a plane with somebody.
1345200	1346200	You've all been there.
1346200	1350200	You've all seen bare feet on a plane.
1350200	1353200	Right?
1353200	1355200	What's going on?
1355200	1358200	Is there anyone here who...
1358200	1359200	Okay.
1359200	1363200	Kid, you take off your shoes and socks on a plane?
1363200	1364200	Well, then get up here.
1365200	1366200	Do you want to come up here?
1366200	1367200	Okay.
1367200	1368200	All right.
1368200	1371200	Get up here and talk about your feet.
1371200	1375200	We're learning about people.
1375200	1379200	I definitely expected...
1379200	1383200	Look, I mean, he doesn't have socks on now.
1383200	1386200	Don't do it!
1386200	1392200	Okay, so when you're on a plane, you take off your shoes and...
1393200	1396200	This really is a show about nothing.
1396200	1399200	Well, what's it supposed to be about?
1399200	1400200	I don't know.
1400200	1403200	I've never listened.
1403200	1406200	So you take off your shoes and your socks?
1406200	1409200	Yeah, well, usually I don't wear socks at all, so I just take off my shoes.
1409200	1410200	All right.
1410200	1411200	That's not fair.
1411200	1412200	Thank you.
1412200	1413200	Yeah.
1413200	1414200	Because that's not...
1414200	1416200	Oh, man, I used to wear socks with my bands, but now it's a touch.
1416200	1418200	Yeah, but why don't you wear socks?
1418200	1420200	Well, with these, it's not...
1421200	1422200	It's kind of tighter, I think.
1422200	1424200	Oh, boo-hoo.
1424200	1427200	It's a little tight, isn't it?
1427200	1428200	Yeah, I don't know.
1428200	1431200	Just fag it.
1431200	1436200	I got two of the words in!
1436200	1438200	Oh, wait, I got cunt too.
1438200	1439200	I think I got all of them.
1439200	1442200	Yeah, what's left?
1442200	1444200	Nothing, really.
1444200	1446200	I don't know.
1446200	1448200	Your mother's balls?
1448200	1449200	I don't know.
1449200	1450200	Oh, my goodness.
1450200	1454200	That was like Sons of Anarchy last week.
1454200	1456200	So, really, okay.
1456200	1462200	Yeah, I mean, so you don't wear socks, so you're 14, and when you take off your shoes,
1462200	1463200	your bare feet are...
1463200	1465200	You know what it is?
1465200	1466200	It's young feet.
1466200	1467200	Young feet are fine.
1467200	1468200	Yeah, they're fine.
1468200	1471200	Okay, now we're learning something about me.
1471200	1475200	Because if there was a 25-year-old woman with beautiful feet, and she was like,
1475200	1476200	I don't have any socks on.
1476200	1478200	Yeah, blah, blah, blah, boo.
1478200	1482200	Nobody would be like, oh, bro, what is this, coach?
1482200	1485200	But it's the fucking...
1485200	1486200	Yeah, it's the...
1486200	1487200	It's youth.
1487200	1489200	It's the 70-year-old man who...
1489200	1490200	Like baby feet.
1490200	1498200	Like, I would rather swim in a billion gallons of baby shit than walk past an old man.
1498200	1499200	Yeah.
1499200	1501200	You know?
1501200	1502200	Yeah.
1502200	1506200	There was a guy on the plane to Chicago today.
1506200	1510200	I looked over, I did a double take.
1510200	1513200	I full disclosure, I only fly first class.
1513200	1516200	So that's already working against this guy.
1516200	1519200	What is he doing?
1519200	1524200	Did you ever see that Tom Hanks, Jackie Gleason movie about dads?
1524200	1533200	And then Tom Hanks looks under the table, and he notices his dad has diabetes.
1533200	1535200	These are the things that happen.
1535200	1541200	For those of you listening, the audience doesn't have a particular emotional attachment
1541200	1542200	to Jackie Gleason.
1542200	1543200	No.
1543200	1548200	A bunch of beer fell on electricity.
1548200	1550200	It's Chicago, so...
1550200	1553200	And we're gonna all run out of here in two seconds.
1553200	1554200	Yeah.
1554200	1555200	What the fuck?
1555200	1556200	I don't care.
1556200	1561200	There was a guy with like fucking black toenails and white flaky feet, and I don't understand
1561200	1565200	why he felt permission to put them up on the wall of the plane.
1565200	1570200	Like he was John Draper in Mad Men, but without shoes.
1570200	1576200	And his gross Bigfoot feet were everywhere, and they were the first signs of him dying,
1576200	1578200	and no one wants to look at that.
1578200	1579200	Right, yeah.
1579200	1581200	Maybe that's what he wanted everyone to see.
1581200	1583200	I mean, maybe I'll get there.
1583200	1585200	Maybe I'm like, okay, yeah, I'm dying.
1585200	1586200	Deal with it.
1586200	1587200	Yeah.
1587200	1588200	Deal with death.
1588200	1589200	All right.
1589200	1590200	You're a mistake.
1590200	1591200	Okay.
1591200	1592200	And then your brother said...
1592200	1594200	I'm glad I'm a footnote to your show.
1594200	1595200	You were gonna speak, too.
1595200	1601960	Oh, your mom is famous for once...
1601960	1605200	You were teasing a neighborhood kid about their name?
1605200	1606200	Oh, yeah.
1606200	1611520	I was teasing someone about their name, and I said, Mom, can you believe this kid's name?
1611520	1614440	And she's like, oh, you should talk.
1615440	1619440	Like, you were at least 50% in charge of naming me.
1620440	1621440	All right.
1621440	1622440	All right, sorry.
1622440	1623440	All right.
1623440	1625440	So, kid, Shoeless Joe.
1625440	1626440	Sockless Joe.
1626440	1627440	Sockless, yeah.
1627440	1628440	What's your name?
1628440	1629440	My name is Michael Zirpak.
1629440	1630440	Michael Zirpak.
1630440	1631440	All right.
1631440	1633440	Another fake name.
1633440	1635440	Weird alien person.
1635440	1640440	Like, here to see if I pass the test and become the last starfighter.
1641440	1646440	Michael Zirpak, is there anything you want to plug before we eject you?
1647440	1648440	Armandown?
1648440	1649440	Yeah, Armandown.
1649440	1651440	I'm actually starting my own blog soon.
1651440	1653440	I'm starting my own blog.
1653440	1655440	No, fucking plug it.
1655440	1656440	Plug it.
1656440	1657440	Okay.
1657440	1660440	I don't have much of a plan for it yet, but...
1660440	1661440	That's no.
1661440	1662440	This is good.
1662440	1663440	This is good.
1663440	1666440	I had an idea for this about a year ago, and I'm starting it now, like, within next month
1666440	1668440	after finals and stuff.
1669440	1670440	Where are you?
1670440	1672440	He's starting a blog.
1673440	1676440	Starting a blog, blog.
1676440	1677440	Yeah.
1677440	1684440	It's gonna be filled with insights about what it's like to not wear socks.
1684440	1685440	All right.
1685440	1686440	Blaine Kepatch, whatever his name is.
1686440	1687440	Oh, yeah.
1687440	1688440	So, um...
1688440	1690440	Can I be in your fucking blog?
1690440	1692440	Will you write my name?
1692440	1693440	Yeah, well, yeah.
1693440	1696440	Actually, when I was waiting for the bathroom, I looked at you and was like,
1696440	1697440	we made eye contact, I think.
1697440	1699440	I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you later.
1700440	1702440	He might be 14.
1702440	1704440	Room 705.
1706440	1708440	Well, I looked at you, and I was like...
1708440	1709440	Hi, Mom.
1711440	1713440	And you looked really familiar, but I didn't put on your face.
1713440	1715440	Yeah, I looked like your future.
1723440	1724440	Get down, baby.
1724440	1725440	Get down.
1725440	1726440	Before it's too late.
1726440	1728440	Oh, I thought you were doing Kanye West.
1731440	1732440	Okay.
1732440	1735440	Yeah, so that blog thing I'm talking about, it's gonna be...
1735440	1736440	Okay.
1737440	1738440	Okay.
1738440	1740440	We'll just do a couple more minutes.
1740440	1743440	No, let them yell at him.
1743440	1748440	They did, but it's gonna be a blog, and it's gonna be on Tumblr.
1748440	1750440	It's called Rushing Backwards right now.
1750440	1752440	It might change name later, but...
1752440	1753440	Oh, okay.
1753440	1755440	For now, it's Rushing Backwards.
1755440	1756440	Yeah.
1756440	1760440	Is there a tweet we can subscribe to on InstaSmurf?
1760440	1763440	To keep up with the blog thing changes?
1763440	1765440	Okay, so...
1765440	1766440	Yeah, I'm going back to Twitter.
1766440	1767440	Jesus, God.
1767440	1769440	No, just give him a second, will you?
1769440	1771440	No, no, okay.
1771440	1774440	It's at michaelzerpac, so...
1774440	1775440	There.
1775440	1777440	M-I-C-H-A-E-L.
1778440	1780440	C-Z-E-R-P-H-A.
1780440	1784440	Just follow your common sense to where you want to go.
1785440	1787440	It's not that typical, people.
1787440	1790440	I want the organ guy to throw the organ at him.
1790440	1791440	Do what water would do.
1791440	1794440	Triple into the blog he's talking about.
1794440	1795440	It's good.
1795440	1796440	It's gonna be good, okay?
1796440	1798440	Dick Wolf, get him out of here!
1798440	1800440	All right, Dick Wolf, get him out of here!
1801440	1803440	Thank you, kid.
1804440	1805440	I think he had the gout.
1805440	1807440	I can't remember...
1807440	1808440	All right.
1808440	1809440	All right, look.
1809440	1812440	I never thought I'd say this, but is it time for D&D yet?
1813440	1816440	Well, it's certainly time for Spencer Crittenden to come to the stage.
1820440	1822440	Standing ovation.
1822440	1825440	Chicago, welcome, Spencer Crittenden.
1828440	1830440	They're on their feet.
1832440	1834440	They're on their fucking feet.
1838440	1841440	Holy fuck, is this the right microphone?
1842440	1844440	Holy shit!
1845440	1848440	There are a lot of sexy women in the audience tonight.
1850440	1855440	There are a lot of sexy women with shorthand in the audience tonight, and also updos.
1855440	1858440	This may be Jim Henson's greatest creation.
1858440	1860440	I have...
1860440	1865440	My dad was a puppeteer, and I have had three beers.
1867440	1869440	Holy shit!
1872440	1874440	My God, you guys.
1874440	1876440	I have had quite a day.
1876440	1877440	Yeah.
1877440	1879440	It wasn't showing us around.
1879440	1881440	No, you showed me around.
1881440	1882440	Right, baby.
1882440	1885440	And by around, I mean the meaning of Greek family.
1885440	1886440	Yeah.
1886440	1888440	Yeah, most of you...
1888440	1893440	It was you in your hotel room, because my text message conversation is with you...
1893440	1895440	Sometimes...
1895440	1898440	Now, in some way, he's supposed to be your assistant, right?
1898440	1899440	Well, yeah, but not...
1899440	1902440	I mean, I'm more of his manservant if we're gonna get technical.
1902440	1905440	Not when we take these trips. He's off the clock.
1905440	1907440	Oh, okay, okay.
1907440	1909440	But, okay, so...
1909440	1911440	Let's see.
1911440	1913440	So Dino went... Oh.
1913440	1915440	Go ahead, talk to me.
1915440	1917440	No, it's important.
1917440	1919440	He's not even drunk.
1919440	1921440	I never drink this much.
1926440	1928440	You're applauding liver damage.
1929440	1931440	It's liver damage you're applauding right now.
1931440	1935440	Can you pull up... Can you pull up your text message conversation with me?
1935440	1937440	And go...
1937440	1940440	And can we do, like, a live reading of...
1940440	1942440	Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1942440	1946440	Of today from... Let's go back to...
1946440	1947440	Do you want me to do the action?
1947440	1949440	Oh, man, we gotta go way back.
1949440	1952440	Let's go back to 7.30 p.m.
1952440	1953440	Who's this guy?
1953440	1956440	Oh, I asked him for a beer before he called me up.
1956440	1957440	Oh, okay.
1958440	1959440	Yeah!
1959440	1961440	Beer guy!
1961440	1963440	Thanks, man.
1963440	1966440	Also, can we just give another hand to the fucking...
1966440	1968440	It's Dennis Scott, is it?
1971440	1973440	Holy shit.
1973440	1975440	He's a civic treasure.
1975440	1978440	He's been enhancing my enjoyment all evening.
1978440	1982440	7.30 p.m. I dropped a pin for you, as Lena Dunham would say.
1982440	1986440	Which you followed up with the words.
1986440	1987440	Start reading.
1987440	1988440	This is where we'll be.
1988440	1990440	I said, this is where we'll be.
1990440	1991440	I dropped a pin.
1991440	1993440	When should we be at the venue?
1993440	1996440	Just had a run-in with the cops.
1996440	1999440	Tell Frito, thanks for the weed.
1999440	2001440	That's him.
2001440	2005440	So, I said, a run-in with the cops?
2005440	2007440	What's going on?
2009440	2010440	Dick Wolf!
2010440	2012440	Do you need help?
2013440	2014440	Lal?
2014440	2015440	No, sorry.
2015440	2018440	I realize the timing of those is odd.
2018440	2020440	I'm smoking weed at the hotel.
2020440	2022440	I'll tell you about the cops later,
2022440	2025440	but they were just protecting corporate interests.
2028440	2030440	They didn't harm me.
2030440	2032440	They didn't harm me.
2032440	2034440	I don't want to jinx it,
2034440	2038440	but I'm getting the distinct feeling this is going to be a satisfying show.
2039440	2042440	I love Dino's family.
2042440	2044440	Oh my God.
2044440	2046440	I love Dino's mom.
2046440	2048440	What's the driver's name?
2048440	2049440	We all do except for me.
2049440	2051440	We're not done with this conversation.
2051440	2053440	Well, I mean, it's not getting better, is it?
2053440	2055440	Well, let's keep it going.
2055440	2057440	What's the driver's name?
2057440	2058440	Max.
2058440	2059440	Gay.
2059440	2061440	Thanks.
2062440	2064440	I might be wrong.
2064440	2067440	Are you getting a ride to the venue?
2067440	2069440	Yeah, from Max.
2070440	2072440	Is it far?
2072440	2075440	We are five-minute drive from venue.
2075440	2077440	Long room on Irving Park.
2077440	2079440	When are you leaving?
2079440	2081440	Fifteen minutes.
2081440	2083440	Fuck, I'm at here.
2085440	2086440	Where?
2086440	2088440	Where do you mean...
2088440	2089440	Time passes.
2089440	2091440	Where do you mean by here?
2091440	2093440	Can we help you in some way?
2093440	2095440	End of the conversation.
2096440	2098440	This is the first time I've seen him.
2102440	2106440	The last thing he said to me was, fuck, I'm at here.
2106440	2107440	That's pretty good.
2107440	2113440	Because every city we go to, because of his clever manipulations on the podcast...
2113440	2116440	Hey, he's not clever, he's just him.
2116440	2121440	He is greeted at the airport by people throwing trash bags of marijuana at him.
2121440	2125440	It's not like that quite to that level.
2125440	2127440	How come I don't get cocaine?
2127440	2129440	It's just a lot more expensive.
2129440	2131440	Oh, that's true.
2131440	2134440	Also, I don't know that there's the community around cocaine that there is around weed.
2134440	2136440	Right, it's more selfish.
2136440	2137440	Yeah.
2137440	2140440	So, we have a lovely dinner.
2144440	2147440	The walls are bleeding, you guys.
2147440	2149440	I mean, we're gonna be fine.
2150440	2154440	No, I had a lovely dinner with Dino and his family, and I came back to the hotel.
2154440	2157440	I really, really had to pee so bad.
2157440	2159440	And I was like, holy shit, I have this weed.
2159440	2161440	My family does that.
2161440	2164440	They make you have to eject fluids.
2166440	2170440	But, yeah, so I got back to the hotel and I'm like, fuck, I need to smoke weed.
2170440	2178440	And I asked the bell desk lady, where can I buy some produce, perhaps an apple or a banana?
2178440	2180440	And 7-Eleven.
2180440	2184440	So, I sprint to 7-Eleven because I had to pee so bad.
2184440	2187440	And right as I'm going in, homeless guy rolls up.
2187440	2189440	He's like, hey, man, you want to be my friend?
2189440	2190440	Whatever.
2190440	2192440	You know, asking me, he wants me to buy him cigarettes.
2192440	2196440	And when I'm hassled, I'll give homeless people stuff that I have.
2196440	2199440	But, fucking, I don't want to buy cigarettes for a homeless guy.
2199440	2204440	That seems kind of a lot of effort.
2204440	2206440	So, I'm telling this guy I can't give him money.
2206440	2208440	And then the cops roll up.
2208440	2210440	And they're like, hey, man, you can't be doing that here.
2210440	2212440	And I'm like, that's not illegal, is it?
2212440	2216440	And he's like, actually, walking up to me sternly, it is actually illegal.
2216440	2219440	And I'm like, oh, it's your job, man.
2219440	2221440	You'd be right.
2221440	2224440	Because I have two grams of weed in my pocket.
2226440	2228440	And I can't...
2230440	2232440	They blow!
2232440	2234440	And I can't...
2235440	2240440	I can't get it into an altercation because, I mean, I'm the guy that's being harmed here,
2240440	2245440	but I could quickly turn into a weird suspect all of a sudden, you know, with weed on his person.
2245440	2250440	I hate to get all Noam Chomsky on you, but even if you don't have two grams of weed in your pocket,
2250440	2254440	you're not allowed to get in an altercation with someone who has a gun and a badge.
2254440	2255440	Yeah, that's it.
2255440	2259440	And also, they're allowed to pull you over on the street and ask to see your proof of a relationship
2259440	2263440	with a corporation that ensures you against collision with another poor person.
2264440	2266440	Yeah, I couldn't talk to that...
2266440	2269440	I legally could not talk to that man.
2269440	2272440	He was being accosted by police for speaking with me.
2272440	2274440	It's fucking insane, I think.
2274440	2276440	But so I have weed, so I have to run.
2276440	2279440	And I run into the store, I buy a lighter, I buy an apple.
2279440	2281440	I run out.
2281440	2283440	I literally sprint away.
2283440	2284440	Why did you buy an apple?
2284440	2286440	We just had, like, fucking Greek food.
2286440	2289440	Because Dino, let me tell you something about apples.
2289440	2291440	Dino, if you take a...
2291440	2294440	You couldn't make a nice pipe out of some spinal copy, though.
2296440	2299440	I ate all of it.
2299440	2301440	But this beer sucks, by the way.
2301440	2303440	What happened to fucking old Milwaukee?
2303440	2305440	Get a daisy cutter, son.
2305440	2308440	This is like Chicago famous ale, half-anchor.
2310440	2312440	But so then I'm back at the hotel smoking weed.
2312440	2316440	I sprint past the police, which has to be the most suspicious thing I've done.
2316440	2318440	But I get back to the hotel, I start smoking weed,
2318440	2326440	and I'm so full of these rich, gout-inducing foods that I barf into the toilet.
2326440	2328440	It's really... It was tough, man.
2328440	2329440	I'm sorry.
2329440	2332440	But let me tell you something about feta cheese.
2334440	2341440	Out of all the foods you can vomit up, feta cheese tastes by far the best.
2343440	2346440	It tastes just like feta coming out.
2346440	2349440	I don't know if that's a compliment, but I'll take it.
2349440	2352440	And that's when I realized this was going to be a good show.
2359440	2360440	How much time do we have left?
2360440	2363440	We had to make this a tight one, because they've got a Rocky Horror Picture Show coming up here.
2363440	2366440	Yeah, if it's 10.55, we've got about 40...
2366440	2367440	Jesus.
2367440	2369440	I'm out of jokes.
2369440	2372440	You don't want to play D&D with us?
2373440	2376440	I want to do anything that anyone wants me to do.
2376440	2378440	I want to play D&D.
2381440	2383440	You weren't very cooperative.
2383440	2386440	I know. I'm not a one-trick pony. I'm going to do it.
2386440	2387440	Okay.
2387440	2391440	All right. Well, I want to bring up somebody I ran into on the sidewalk out there.
2391440	2393440	If she's willing to come up.
2393440	2395440	Does she have short hair?
2395440	2396440	Oh, come on.
2396440	2398440	I'm the guy who hits on people.
2398440	2400440	Hey, I'm drunk now.
2400440	2402440	It's new Spencer.
2405440	2407440	I got to tell you, I'm sharing a room with Dustin.
2407440	2410440	Seriously, just date Spencer for a while.
2410440	2412440	Yeah, all you Chicago people.
2412440	2414440	Come on. Seriously.
2414440	2416440	He's a good guy. I love him.
2418440	2419440	Not you.
2419440	2421440	Spencer got a story.
2422440	2423440	All right, knock it up.
2423440	2426440	I'm a bad person when I'm drunk. I'm sorry, whoever that was.
2426440	2428440	You're very sweet. You're very sweet.
2428440	2429440	Thank you. Thank you.
2429440	2431440	It's so embarrassing. Two beers.
2431440	2432440	You're fine. Three beers.
2432440	2433440	You're fine. We love you.
2433440	2434440	Five beers.
2434440	2436440	We all love him, right? We love him.
2441440	2443440	Oh, can I tell you about the Uber driver?
2443440	2445440	I got the Uber driver to pick me up.
2445440	2447440	You're starting to wear thin.
2447440	2448440	I know. I know.
2448440	2449440	This is the last anecdote.
2449440	2451440	I'm joking. I just said we love him.
2451440	2453440	I got the Uber driver to pick me up.
2453440	2455440	And he was like, which way do you want to go?
2455440	2456440	Do you want to take the expressway?
2456440	2457440	Do you want to take service streets?
2457440	2461440	I'm like, oh, man, I'm not from around here.
2461440	2465440	What do you, whatever works because I'm high as fuck.
2466440	2469440	And the guy is like, I'll take the fastest way.
2469440	2474440	You know, us taxicab drivers make more money if we get more people.
2474440	2477440	So I'll take you the fastest way.
2477440	2479440	I'm like, what the fuck, dude?
2479440	2483440	I'm deferring to you and you're trying to get all high and mighty over what
2483440	2485440	weighs the best.
2485440	2488440	And then I realized he was just being really helpful.
2488440	2493440	He was just like, this is what you need to know about cab drivers
2493440	2495440	is this is how they make their money.
2495440	2496440	He was trying to help.
2496440	2498440	I thought he was being all high and mighty to me, being like,
2498440	2500440	here's how it works, man.
2500440	2502440	We get people to where they're going.
2502440	2504440	That's how we make money.
2504440	2507440	But he was like, no, we actually, this is our business.
2507440	2510440	And so we had a lovely talk.
2510440	2514440	So Spencer, do you feel better now that you've let this out?
2514440	2517440	No, I feel really hurt, betrayed.
2517440	2521440	I feel like Spencer, you're a young man.
2521440	2522440	You're a young man.
2522440	2524440	There's a rate.
2527440	2529440	Go ahead, say something else.
2530440	2532440	There is a storm raging beneath you.
2532440	2535440	There's a storm raging beneath you.
2536440	2538440	He gets it.
2538440	2539440	He gets it.
2541440	2546440	When Spencer, I want to tell everybody here in Chicago,
2546440	2551440	when we've gone to how many 45,000 cities together?
2551440	2553440	No, 47,000.
2553440	2557440	Spencer, nothing I look forward to more,
2557440	2562440	like the idea of, oh, we're going to this and that city.
2562440	2565440	Let's all meet at my house and get into a car together.
2565440	2566440	Yeah, how's he going to react?
2566440	2570440	Spencer is always like, I'll go by myself.
2570440	2572440	And I was like, OK, all right, fine.
2572440	2576440	Then over time, it's like, Spencer, why are you always going by yourself?
2576440	2578440	And then Spencer slowly reveals.
2578440	2585440	He says, I don't want to not go to the airport with you guys.
2585440	2590440	But I like to have my car at the airport because when the plane lands,
2590440	2593440	I want to get to my car as quickly as possible
2593440	2598440	and have control over where I'm going as quickly as possible.
2598440	2603440	And that's something that's taken away from me when I take a car.
2603440	2604440	Look at him.
2604440	2605440	He looks like a hermit.
2605440	2608440	I can't believe he cares about control.
2608440	2613440	So today, I got new insight into this because you said,
2613440	2617440	and this is a second time I've been in a car with you.
2617440	2620440	We've been driving and I pop up on my laptop
2620440	2622440	and I start playing Minecraft.
2622440	2626440	And Spencer, this is the second time Spencer says to the driver,
2626440	2637440	hey, how long do you think it will take to get there?
2637440	2639440	How long do you think it will take to get there?
2639440	2641440	What's the estimated time?
2641440	2648440	And the driver will go like, oh, I guess if there's wind,
2648440	2650440	I've got 27 minutes.
2651440	2654440	Yeah, but isn't that me texting you asking you how long?
2654440	2656440	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2656440	2657440	Thank you, though.
2657440	2658440	I appreciate that.
2658440	2664440	Spencer in a vacuum cannot handle being contained in a metal cocoon
2664440	2667440	with no control over wind or knowledge over wind.
2667440	2671440	I just feel like I'll become a metal butterfly.
2671440	2674440	So today, he did it again.
2674440	2677440	He goes like, how long did the thing?
2677440	2681440	And the driver, who's adorable, goes like, with traffic, 20 minutes.
2681440	2686440	And then the driver kept going, the driver kept going like,
2686440	2688440	oh, just because Spencer said that, he's like,
2688440	2690440	just 15 more minutes of the thing.
2690440	2695440	And Spencer said, paraphrasing, Spencer said,
2695440	2700440	look, I wasn't asking earlier because I'm on a schedule.
2700440	2704440	It's just that normally when I drive to places,
2704440	2707440	I know when I'm going to get there.
2707440	2708440	It's true.
2708440	2710440	And when someone else is driving me,
2710440	2712440	I don't know when I'm going to get there.
2712440	2713440	It's true.
2713440	2716440	So I need to ask them when I'm going to get there.
2716440	2721440	And I was like, this is fascinating.
2721440	2723440	This is incredible.
2723440	2726440	Because I've never, I would get, I mean,
2726440	2728440	and I'm not a good person for staying this.
2728440	2733440	I would get out of an airport, jump into a car, six hours.
2733440	2735440	I would be like, whoa.
2735440	2736440	Thanks a lot.
2736440	2737440	Here's $50.
2737440	2740440	Spencer's like, he needs to know where he's going
2740440	2741440	and what's going on.
2741440	2743440	You don't trust anybody.
2743440	2747440	It's, well, yeah, I don't.
2747440	2748440	You trust me, don't you?
2748440	2751440	Yeah, totally.
2751440	2754440	I mean, this is not humorous, but it's just like,
2754440	2757440	my whole life is about getting to know situations
2757440	2758440	before I enter them.
2758440	2761440	Like, I'm all about research and putting in leg work
2762440	2764440	and figuring out how things are going to be
2764440	2766440	and then easing myself into a situation.
2766440	2768440	When I'm traveling, it's really weird
2768440	2770440	not knowing exactly where we're going
2770440	2771440	or how long it'll take.
2771440	2773440	And it's just like, if I'm in LA,
2773440	2775440	I'll be like, it'll take 10 minutes to get here
2775440	2776440	and 10 minutes to get here.
2776440	2778440	It's just interesting not having,
2778440	2781440	not being that person designed to get me places
2781440	2783440	and not knowing if I'm going to be in the car
2783440	2785440	for 15 minutes or 70 minutes.
2785440	2786440	It's weird.
2786440	2789440	Describe to me the worst case scenario.
2789440	2791440	What do you think of when you go,
2791440	2793440	like, I don't want to be this guy?
2793440	2795440	Well, I have to shit.
2795440	2797440	Like, I really have to go to the bathroom
2797440	2801440	or do something or I'm thinking about, like, masturbating or...
2801440	2804440	You would hate being a dog.
2804440	2807440	But you could say to anybody, I have to pull over,
2807440	2808440	I have to take a shit.
2808440	2810440	I'm saying, like, what's your worst...
2810440	2811440	Wait, what?
2811440	2812440	Let's unpack that.
2812440	2817440	Well, if somebody's driving you for so long
2817440	2818440	that you have to...
2818440	2819440	Oh, yeah.
2819440	2820440	No, no.
2820440	2822440	In that very same Uber driver I was in,
2822440	2824440	I almost didn't reroute the car
2824440	2826440	to the direction we were supposed to be going
2826440	2828440	because I didn't want to bother the guy.
2828440	2832440	Like, that's just my damage.
2832440	2835440	But are you polite or are you a control freak?
2835440	2837440	Because you don't want to know
2837440	2839440	how soon you can get somewhere.
2839440	2841440	Yeah, I mean, that's literally the first time
2841440	2842440	I've asked that question.
2842440	2844440	We've been on the road several times
2844440	2845440	where I haven't had...
2845440	2847440	This is fucking boring.
2847440	2848440	I don't...
2848440	2850440	I'm a bad person.
2850440	2851440	You're right, Dan.
2851440	2853440	I should fix myself.
2853440	2854440	I didn't see you were a bad person.
2854440	2855440	No, I know.
2855440	2856440	I know.
2856440	2859440	I just want to spice the things up.
2861440	2863440	I just think it's amazing that you can't...
2863440	2864440	How's my Greek?
2864440	2866440	You can't put him in a car if you...
2866440	2867440	I don't like change, man.
2867440	2868440	You really don't want to change.
2868440	2869440	You can't put him in a car
2869440	2871440	and you don't tell him where he's going
2871440	2872440	and how soon he's going to get there.
2872440	2873440	He will...
2873440	2874440	Yeah.
2874440	2876440	Hey, look at him now.
2876440	2878440	Yeah, look at me now, Dan.
2878440	2880440	Look at me now.
2882440	2883440	All right, so...
2883440	2884440	It's a time for D&D.
2884440	2885440	All right, yeah.
2885440	2887440	We're in a tight schedule here.
2888440	2890440	We're going to need a woman to play
2890440	2891440	some of the womanly characters.
2891440	2892440	I...
2892440	2893440	Hold it.
2893440	2895440	I met a woman on the sidewalk.
2896440	2898440	And she pushed all the right buttons
2898440	2901440	because she's a professor
2901440	2904440	at the University of Chicago.
2905440	2908440	She studies neurology
2908440	2912440	and its relationship with racism.
2913440	2915440	Jenny, are you here?
2916440	2917440	Uh-oh.
2921440	2922440	Oh, shit.
2923440	2925440	This is the updo.
2926440	2928440	I'm sorry to reduce you to your haircut.
2928440	2930440	That's not what you deserve at all.
2930440	2931440	I didn't.
2931440	2932440	Hello.
2932440	2933440	Really think about that, Spencer.
2933440	2935440	She studies neurology
2935440	2938440	and its relationship with racism.
2938440	2939440	Yeah.
2939440	2941440	Yes, you can have all kinds of beers.
2942440	2943440	Is there a microphone?
2943440	2945440	They're shitty non-Chicago beers.
2945440	2946440	Oh, shit.
2946440	2947440	You need maybe that.
2947440	2948440	Hi.
2948440	2949440	Does that work?
2949440	2950440	Does that work?
2950440	2951440	Old Milwaukee or something.
2951440	2952440	This is good.
2952440	2953440	Ugh.
2953440	2954440	It's a Brooklyn lager.
2954440	2955440	All right, so...
2955440	2957440	Neurology, as I understand,
2957440	2960440	is about the firmware of the human mind,
2960440	2961440	if not the hardware.
2961440	2963440	Shit, we cannot change.
2963440	2964440	True.
2964440	2966440	So, I'm assuming you're going to say
2966440	2968440	some uncomfortable things
2968440	2969440	if you're a neurologist
2969440	2971440	and you're studying racism.
2971440	2973440	Well, I'm a neuroscientist.
2973440	2974440	It's slightly different
2974440	2976440	because I don't have a medical degree.
2976440	2977440	Wait, you study racism?
2977440	2978440	What?
2978440	2980440	Yeah, so I study stereotyping...
2980440	2981440	I said the n-word today.
2981440	2982440	What did you think about that?
2982440	2983440	So I'm talking about...
2983440	2985440	Did it turn you on?
2987440	2988440	We're all on different tracks.
2988440	2990440	Route 705, baby.
2991440	2992440	I love the...
2992440	2993440	We're all on the same track.
2993440	2994440	I love that the...
2994440	2995440	We're all on the same track.
2995440	2996440	We're all on the same track.
2996440	2997440	That was...
2997440	2998440	Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.
2998440	3000440	That's any time Dino enters a room.
3004440	3006440	Yeah, so I study stereotyping
3006440	3008440	and prejudice in the brain.
3008440	3009440	What does that mean?
3009440	3010440	Okay.
3010440	3011440	So I study how...
3011440	3013440	I don't think Asians could do that.
3022440	3023440	Fact.
3025440	3026440	Awesome.
3028440	3030440	Can we please tell the podcast people at home that...
3030440	3032440	Oh yeah, so that she's slightly Asian, I guess.
3032440	3033440	Slightly!
3033440	3035440	I'm mixed race.
3035440	3036440	I'm mixed race.
3036440	3037440	Mixed race.
3037440	3038440	Yeah.
3038440	3040440	Yeah, well, who's dominant, baby?
3042440	3043440	I'm perfect quarter.
3043440	3044440	A quarter.
3044440	3045440	I got a quarter in my pocket.
3045440	3046440	Yeah.
3046440	3048440	That says you're a full Asian.
3048440	3049440	What?
3049440	3050440	I don't know.
3051440	3052440	Yikes!
3052440	3053440	Yikes!
3053440	3056440	That's from a radio play called Hitler Hitshine Women.
3059440	3061440	You got a little Nazi in you?
3066440	3067440	Sorry.
3067440	3071440	Yeah, so I'm Japanese, French, Mexican, and Native American.
3071440	3072440	Native American?
3072440	3073440	Oh man.
3073440	3074440	Yeah.
3074440	3075440	French?
3075440	3077440	French is the only thing that is an Asian in you.
3077440	3078440	Yeah.
3078440	3079440	Native American?
3079440	3080440	Yeah, those are not Asian.
3080440	3081440	No.
3081440	3084440	Well, didn't the Native Americans come over on the very straight?
3084440	3085440	That's Asian.
3085440	3086440	Yeah, didn't they like...
3086440	3087440	By definition!
3087440	3091440	By the word Native American, that means Asian.
3091440	3093440	Didn't they come over on the...
3093440	3094440	No.
3094440	3095440	Not at all.
3095440	3096440	Not at all.
3096440	3097440	They took that ice bridge.
3097440	3098440	What else are you...
3098440	3099440	Wait, what else did you say?
3099440	3101440	I said French, Japanese.
3101440	3102440	Japanese, yeah.
3102440	3104440	Native American and Mexican.
3104440	3105440	Yeah, Mexican.
3105440	3107440	That's as Asian as you could get.
3108440	3110440	We're getting sidetracked here.
3110440	3111440	Yeah.
3111440	3113440	I think her studies are the important thing.
3113440	3115440	Oh, are they?
3115440	3116440	I don't know about that.
3116440	3117440	Or are they?
3117440	3120440	We'll find out from her studies.
3121440	3122440	So I...
3122440	3128440	Yeah, I show people pictures of, you know, different races and see how their brains respond.
3128440	3130440	So what does that mean, how their brains respond?
3130440	3131440	What are you measuring?
3131440	3134440	So I typically measure...
3134440	3136440	I put people in fMRIs, MRIs.
3136440	3142440	And then I look at how their brains respond differently to typically white and black people.
3142440	3147440	And how it's co-opted for the same systems that we respond to for emotion.
3147440	3154440	So how we respond to basic things like snakes and spiders and how that's co-opted for things like race.
3154440	3160440	So you're putting people in a tube and scanning their brain and seeing which parts of their brains light up.
3160440	3164440	And they're showing them images of snakes, spiders, black people, and white people.
3166440	3168440	Typically not snakes and spiders.
3168440	3172440	Typically black people, white people, Asians.
3172440	3175440	I mean, don't be afraid to get really detailed about that.
3175440	3183440	Yeah, so sometimes we like put people in tubes, show them pictures of different races, have them shoot people of different races.
3183440	3184440	Wait, like video?
3184440	3186440	And then see how their brain responds.
3186440	3188440	Wow, you finally got my attention.
3188440	3189440	Yeah, right.
3189440	3191440	For a while I was like...
3193440	3194440	Boring.
3194440	3196440	But now, here we go.
3198440	3202440	We don't have the fMRIs machine, but can you test Dan?
3202440	3204440	Can you test Dan right now?
3204440	3205440	I could, yeah.
3205440	3206440	Oh shit.
3206440	3207440	Wait, you can test me...
3207440	3209440	I mean, I could stick you in a tube, yeah.
3209440	3211440	Just point at it and say he's racist.
3215440	3216440	I know, he protests too much.
3216440	3220440	I'm the only non-racist here, in this fucking room.
3220440	3222440	Room 705.
3226440	3230440	I'm asking sincerely, what is your branch?
3230440	3233440	What are you guys seeking to discover?
3233440	3238440	So my specific branch, which is not necessarily everyone's who studies the same thing that I do,
3238440	3242440	is about how to mitigate discrimination.
3242440	3246440	So I study ways to make people not racist.
3246440	3248440	Make me not racist.
3248440	3249440	It's gonna be...
3249440	3250440	I dare you.
3250440	3253440	It's gonna be pretty fucking hard right now.
3254440	3255440	Can I ask you an honest question?
3255440	3261440	Is it about being aware and trying to actively combat your inherent biases?
3261440	3263440	Yeah, actually that's absolutely what it is.
3263440	3265440	So it's mostly about...
3267440	3268440	I keep...
3268440	3269440	This is terrible.
3269440	3273440	I keep telling that to people and then they keep calling me racist.
3274440	3277440	It's like, well, I can admit my inherent biases.
3277440	3280440	It's mostly that people are in the culture.
3280440	3281440	They grow up in the same culture.
3281440	3282440	They know the same shit.
3282440	3284440	Everyone has access to the same knowledge.
3284440	3287440	And that knowledge influences your split-second decisions,
3287440	3290440	whether you actually really want it to or not.
3290440	3294440	So people who explicitly really don't want to be racist and fuck.
3294440	3298440	Who would never hurt a fly if they had to think about it for a second.
3298440	3301440	In a split-second decision, we'll do it.
3301440	3302440	Shit.
3302440	3304440	Because of their circumstances.
3304440	3305440	They grow up.
3305440	3313440	Which is why the solution to racism would be increasing exposure to an environment
3313440	3318440	in which those neurological pathways were no longer formed.
3318440	3319440	Yeah.
3319440	3324440	In other words, just people getting bored with the idea that we come in different colors.
3325440	3331440	Yeah, so I think ultimately the idea is to make people not discriminate based on race
3331440	3336440	in terms of their neurological responses and their split-second decisions.
3336440	3342440	But right now, noticing race is important because there's a lot of socio-economical
3342440	3345440	status shit that goes on based on race.
3345440	3350440	So if you deny someone their race, you're kind of denying a whole history of shit
3350440	3351440	that they went through.
3352440	3354440	That's a really interesting thing, yeah.
3357440	3358440	Take a drink.
3358440	3365440	The modern idea that invisibility of race is the definition of non-racism
3365440	3369440	has this weird cloaked aggression to it.
3369440	3370440	I agree.
3370440	3377440	Which comes from Big Brother, which is like, oh, who wants more than George W. Bush,
3378440	3383440	for instance, or the Pentagon, for all of us to not see anything other than another
3383440	3385440	human being when we look at each other?
3385440	3386440	But wait, okay.
3386440	3388440	This is a serious thing.
3388440	3389440	Finally.
3390440	3397440	My daughter, when she was in preschool and kindergarten, she had a friend who was black.
3400440	3401440	That's not a bad thing.
3401440	3402440	No.
3403440	3405440	Well, we'll get to that.
3405440	3406440	Just hold on.
3407440	3410440	I'm going to turn her around.
3410440	3412440	I'm going to make her the biggest racist here.
3412440	3413440	No.
3414440	3418440	But she was asked to describe her friend, who she was talking about.
3418440	3419440	And she described her.
3419440	3423440	She said, very long, beautiful hair and brown eyes.
3423440	3425440	And she didn't mention her skin or anything.
3425440	3431440	She didn't see the defining characteristics of race in that.
3431440	3434440	When do we first start seeing that?
3434440	3440440	Actually, it happens around three and four years old, but it gets stronger the older we get.
3440440	3442440	Because I think we're conditioned.
3442440	3444440	It's because of exposure.
3444440	3452440	So you are exposed to cultural attitudes and associations through TV and media and all kinds of.
3452440	3454440	And your parents, mostly your parents.
3454440	3455440	Right.
3455440	3457440	It's people coming out and saying that person's black.
3457440	3462440	And also, you notice novelty and things in your environment that are different from you.
3462440	3470440	And you get rewarded for if somebody were to come up to me after the show and they were to say, hey, my name's Glenn.
3470440	3471440	Glenn Johnson.
3471440	3474440	I saw you at the such and such show.
3474440	3476440	Remember me with the pink hat.
3476440	3484440	And if I were to go pink hat, you and all you guys with the pink hats and you guys were there at the bachelor party.
3484440	3486440	You the dopamine spikes.
3486440	3489440	You get rewarded as a primate for noticing patterns.
3489440	3491440	You accelerate.
3491440	3495440	You excel as a primate because you remember things.
3495440	3497440	You remember patterns and connections.
3497440	3506440	Our brains formed to notice, to systematically process things and regulate and condense all the shit that we process.
3506440	3508440	The simplest way to do that is to put a label on someone.
3508440	3516440	Like the definition of charming is James Bond walking into a casino and smelling someone's perfume and saying, oh, that's that kind of perfume.
3516440	3519440	And the woman says, oh, my God, you're so amazing.
3519440	3524440	You're so much more amazing than other men.
3524440	3526440	The audience isn't applauding.
3526440	3528440	Spencer got a beer, everyone.
3528440	3529440	Spencer got a beer.
3529440	3530440	I'm sorry.
3530440	3531440	We have to describe this.
3531440	3533440	How many beers is that now?
3533440	3539440	Let's talk about racism.
3539440	3543440	Connections like people remembering what color your eyes are.
3543440	3546440	Winter anniversary, all these things.
3546440	3549440	Seemingly superficial connections.
3549440	3559440	They become, when they're politicized, when they're attached to an inherently classist society, that's when they become problematic.
3559440	3562440	In all other areas, we reward them.
3562440	3564440	We go, oh, that guy's so awesome.
3564440	3567440	He remembered my birthday.
3567440	3569440	True.
3569440	3573440	I thought you'd back me up more on this than that.
3573440	3577440	No, she's a contrarian.
3577440	3585440	Well, I feel like we get rewarded for processing things in that manner, but that can get us into trouble, right?
3585440	3595440	If you're a police officer and you make a split-second decision to shoot an unarmed black man because you have these associations, that's not fucking okay.
3595440	3600440	No, it's not.
3600440	3601440	You killed your mother.
3601440	3603440	No, we're being censored.
3603440	3604440	But you're right.
3604440	3605440	You're right.
3605440	3607440	In any other circumstance, we are rewarded.
3607440	3610440	Yeah, I certainly wasn't saying, oh, God, racism is great.
3610440	3622440	What I'm saying is that racism is a thing that we fucking struggle with, and it's not necessarily because we wake up in the morning and go, I'm going to go hate a bunch of people today.
3622440	3625440	It's often because we're...
3625440	3626440	What's going on over here?
3626440	3627440	No, nothing's going on.
3627440	3631440	We're just having a great discussion.
3631440	3632440	How many beers have you had?
3632440	3635440	Just less racism.
3635440	3638440	No, I've had like three or five.
3638440	3639440	Five?
3639440	3640440	I don't know.
3640440	3643440	I can't get anything done with this guy.
3643440	3644440	You're damn right.
3644440	3646440	What you're saying is right.
3646440	3649440	I mean, that's how we developed, evolved as humans.
3649440	3654440	It's how we not got eaten, but it's also how we decided racism was a cool thing.
3654440	3655440	It's true.
3655440	3656440	All right.
3656440	3657440	Okay.
3657440	3658440	I'm sorry.
3658440	3659440	I'm listening.
3659440	3660440	I do my thing.
3660440	3661440	I've read the reviews of my podcast.
3661440	3662440	I know that I talk about that shit too much.
3662440	3664440	People love your podcast, Dan.
3664440	3670440	Shut up, Spencer.
3670440	3672440	She's a neurologist that studied racism.
3672440	3673440	I thought it would be interesting.
3673440	3675440	It was interesting to talk to her.
3675440	3676440	It is interesting.
3676440	3677440	It still is.
3677440	3678440	I would like to talk to her for six hours.
3678440	3679440	I would too.
3679440	3680440	It could not be too.
3680440	3681440	That's fine.
3681440	3682440	It could not be too.
3682440	3683440	That's fine.
3683440	3685440	Let's keep her up here.
3685440	3686440	I like this.
3686440	3687440	This is like the Dick Cavett show.
3687440	3690440	Did you ever watch that?
3690440	3693440	Historically, less people did.
3693440	3696440	Than your show?
3696440	3697440	All right.
3697440	3698440	Stay up here for a second, will you?
3698440	3699440	Okay.
3699440	3700440	And play Dungeons and Dragons with us?
3700440	3701440	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3701440	3702440	All right.
3702440	3709440	When do we have to be out of here?
3709440	3710440	10.
3710440	3711440	55?
3711440	3712440	10.
3712440	3713440	50.
3713440	3714440	20 minutes.
3714440	3715440	20 minutes?
3715440	3716440	Oh, Jesus.
3716440	3717440	That's a really long Dungeons and Dragons.
3717440	3718440	No, it's not.
3718440	3719440	We can't do anything about it.
3719440	3720440	Don't get mad.
3720440	3724440	A lot of you are here because in your youth, Rocky Horror Picture Show happened to you.
3724440	3726440	They do it here at the time.
3726440	3727440	It happens to people.
3727440	3730440	And by the way, Dan told me he'll talk to you forever after this.
3731440	3733440	Well, that is true.
3733440	3735440	Where are we going to be after the show?
3735440	3737440	Let's go to the long room.
3737440	3738440	All of us.
3738440	3739440	No, no, no.
3739440	3740440	It's long enough.
3740440	3742440	We have a place that we've arranged.
3742440	3743440	Collins.
3743440	3744440	Collins?
3744440	3746440	We'll figure it out.
3746440	3747440	Yeah, so I'll be there.
3747440	3748440	I don't think everyone's going to fit.
3748440	3750440	To get ourselves a snack.
3758440	3759440	All right.
3759440	3761440	Who podcasts, Dan?
3770440	3773440	I just heard my mom saying that.
3774440	3776440	I didn't hear my mom say anything.
3776440	3779440	That fucking bitch has been quiet all night.
3779440	3785440	I wish I had the relationship with my mom that Dino does.
3785440	3788440	I don't think she has the relationship I have with her.
3790440	3791440	I think we all feel that way.
3791440	3795440	Because his mom's like, you know, she's a fucking badass.
3795440	3796440	She's a badass.
3796440	3797440	She is a badass.
3797440	3798440	She is a badass.
3798440	3801440	She ate dinner with us and she's flinty and she's charming.
3801440	3803440	She kept offering me tzatziki.
3803440	3805440	It was great.
3805440	3808440	That's what those cunts do, man.
3808440	3810440	They offer tzatziki.
3810440	3812440	I love my mother.
3812440	3813440	I love her.
3813440	3814440	All right.
3814440	3816440	Do we have enough people to play?
3816440	3817440	Let's see.
3817440	3818440	Dungeon Master.
3821440	3822440	They're way ahead of us.
3822440	3823440	Yeah, they got it.
3823440	3825440	They got our number.
3825440	3826440	Do we need another person?
3826440	3828440	Is that?
3828440	3829440	Yeah.
3829440	3830440	Yeah.
3830440	3832440	Yeah.
3832440	3833440	I'm not picking.
3833440	3835440	All of your yelling is in vain.
3835440	3836440	I'm not picking anything.
3836440	3837440	I promise.
3837440	3838440	Oh, my God.
3838440	3839440	Oh, my God.
3839440	3840440	He fell down.
3840440	3841440	Oh.
3848440	3849440	Did anybody get.
3849440	3850440	I just heard.
3850440	3851440	Did anybody get that on their iPhone?
3851440	3852440	No.
3852440	3853440	No.
3853440	3854440	Dan fell down.
3854440	3855440	Dan fell down.
3856440	3860440	His leg could be broken now and he wouldn't let on.
3860440	3861440	No, no.
3861440	3862440	I would never.
3864440	3866440	How do we choose?
3866440	3869440	Is Dan actually OK?
3869440	3870440	Is he OK?
3870440	3871440	I don't know.
3871440	3872440	This guy.
3872440	3873440	Oh, my God.
3873440	3874440	This guy's got a Vincent Price shirt on.
3874440	3875440	I mean, he's lying.
3876440	3878440	He's in the crowd.
3878440	3880440	I don't think they can hear us.
3880440	3882440	Check your privilege, everybody.
3882440	3884440	I'm looking for handicapped people.
3884440	3885440	I'm looking for.
3887440	3889440	I'm a full Asian.
3889440	3890440	Full Asian.
3890440	3892440	We already got like a kind of.
3892440	3893440	Yes.
3893440	3895440	Sit down, you fucking nip.
3895440	3896440	I think we're fighting.
3896440	3897440	What?
3898440	3899440	Oh, thank you.
3899440	3900440	OK.
3906440	3907440	All right.
3907440	3909440	That's that's OK.
3910440	3911440	Oh, my God.
3913440	3914440	Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
3914440	3917440	Yeah, I can't believe the mics go that deep.
3918440	3920440	I guess you guys come on.
3922440	3927440	There's nobody that has like a like an over the top like disability or.
3927440	3930440	That's such a rude, weird thing.
3936440	3937440	Yeah.
3940440	3941440	He's a Mormon.
3941440	3943440	We got a Mormon over here.
3943440	3945440	Let's just start dancing.
3945440	3946440	What are you pointing at him for?
3946440	3947440	What's it?
3947440	3948440	What's his deal?
3949440	3951440	This is just saying what's his deal?
3956440	3957440	She has short hair.
3965440	3969440	You guys are the worst.
3973440	3974440	I'm looking for it.
3974440	3975440	All right.
3975440	3976440	What's this guy's deal?
3977440	3978440	What kind of cripple?
3980440	3981440	How crippled is he?
3981440	3982440	I know.
3983440	3984440	He's got a fucked up head.
3985440	3986440	You're not right.
3986440	3987440	He's got a fucked up head.
3987440	3988440	Bring him up here.
3988440	3989440	See, look, we did it.
3991440	3992440	Great.
3992440	3996440	Justin, I don't know if you might cut at some point.
3996440	3997440	You're telling me.
3998440	3999440	Wait, what's happening?
3999440	4001440	We got a guy with a fucked up hip coming up.
4001440	4002440	This is live.
4002440	4004440	I think a lot of them broke away.
4004440	4005440	We don't even get to edit this.
4005440	4006440	You don't have anyone.
4006440	4008440	Dan, you don't have anyone.
4008440	4009440	No, he has a fucked up hip.
4009440	4010440	He's coming.
4010440	4011440	Oh, okay.
4012440	4013440	I'm sorry, man.
4013440	4014440	I didn't know.
4014440	4015440	This shit is live.
4015440	4016440	We can't even edit this.
4017440	4018440	What do you think's for sale?
4018440	4020440	It's not manimal on Thursday nights.
4020440	4021440	Oh, my God.
4021440	4024440	Can we watch manimal on Thursday nights?
4024440	4025440	But I'm worried.
4025440	4027440	Are we going to get canceled?
4027440	4028440	Yeah.
4031440	4032440	All right.
4032440	4033440	I met this guy, right?
4033440	4034440	Hi, I know.
4034440	4036440	Yeah, I met you when I was waiting in line.
4036440	4038440	You got me upside down cross and everything.
4038440	4039440	All right.
4039440	4041440	Why don't you sit down here in this chair?
4041440	4043440	I mean, he's pretty much me.
4043440	4044440	I should go sit down, right?
4044440	4045440	Yeah, man.
4045440	4046440	Get out of here.
4048440	4049440	My friends would like to hang out with you.
4049440	4050440	I'll hang out with them.
4051440	4052440	Oh, yeah.
4052440	4053440	Just do it.
4053440	4056440	I'll take pictures with people while you guys do your dragons.
4056440	4061440	I'm proud of myself without talking to him or fighting the opposite of her
4065440	4066440	in every way.
4069440	4072440	If you were an alien and you were going to eat humans,
4074440	4077440	these were the two shakers you'd have on your table.
4078440	4082440	It needs a little bit more upside down cross on a baseball cap.
4083440	4086440	No, there's a couple shakes of a quarter Asian.
4091440	4092440	Come on down.
4094440	4096440	Daniel Scott, everybody.
4096440	4097440	Daniel Scott.
4101440	4102440	I love that.
4102440	4105440	I love that that's come full circle to everyone just being like, yeah.
4106440	4108440	The universal music for boring.
4110440	4111440	Boring.
4112440	4115440	What if you went to China and you were at a baseball game and they said,
4115440	4120440	please rise for the national anthem and it was that that you know,
4120440	4125440	you laugh, but that exact thing happened to the country of Kazakhstan because
4125440	4129440	the Borat version of the Kazakhstan theme song played at the fucking Olympics.
4129440	4130440	Really?
4130440	4131440	Yeah.
4131440	4132440	How does it go?
4132440	4134440	Kazakhstan is great.
4134440	4137440	His country in the world, you know, like that.
4137440	4139440	Am I on yet?
4139440	4141440	You could have it, man.
4141440	4142440	Thank you.
4142440	4144440	He's a lovely gent.
4145440	4147440	Why is your cat a little black?
4149440	4150440	You made me cry today.
4150440	4152440	Don't do that.
4152440	4153440	What are you crying?
4153440	4154440	Stop it.
4154440	4155440	I cried.
4155440	4156440	My friends can tell you I cried.
4156440	4157440	Why about what?
4158440	4159440	It was so amazing.
4159440	4161440	You're like the Beatles fans.
4161440	4162440	Not good.
4163440	4164440	I am.
4164440	4166440	I see that video of their girl.
4167440	4168440	Was John Lennon.
4168440	4169440	I'm excited.
4169440	4170440	I was here.
4171440	4173440	A lot of a lot of pot cookies.
4173440	4175440	Was John Lennon a beetle?
4176440	4177440	Fuck.
4178440	4179440	Hey, you're good, though.
4179440	4181440	I have a lot of pot cookie too, man.
4181440	4182440	I didn't.
4183440	4184440	You are John Lennon.
4184440	4185440	What the fuck are you talking about?
4185440	4187440	I'm talking about getting shot.
4188440	4189440	He got shot, right?
4189440	4192440	I don't know people or things.
4193440	4194440	What?
4194440	4196440	We should just cash it all in and go home, right?
4196440	4197440	Almost.
4198440	4200440	My mic didn't have that much battery.
4200440	4201440	Thanks.
4201440	4202440	I definitely need to blow my nose.
4202440	4204440	That's very kind of you.
4207440	4208440	Thank you.
4208440	4210440	That's very kind of you to blow my nose with.
4210440	4211440	All right.
4211440	4212440	He's inconspicuous.
4212440	4216440	So you think you could do a little D&D with us?
4217440	4218440	Yes.
4218440	4219440	He does think that.
4219440	4221440	I will answer for him.
4223440	4224440	Okay.
4224440	4225440	All right.
4225440	4227440	Well, turn towards that guy.
4227440	4229440	Now you say those words.
4229440	4232440	You think you could do some D&D with us?
4232440	4233440	Yes.
4236440	4238440	I just blew my nose.
4238440	4239440	All right.
4239440	4240440	Yeah.
4240440	4241440	Yeah.
4241440	4242440	Whatever.
4242440	4243440	Just take it easy.
4243440	4244440	Come on.
4244440	4245440	I know.
4245440	4246440	We've got to get out of here in 12 minutes.
4246440	4247440	I know.
4247440	4248440	What do you want?
4248440	4249440	Where are the characters?
4249440	4250440	Yeah.
4250440	4251440	Yeah.
4251440	4252440	Yeah.
4252440	4253440	Yeah.
4253440	4254440	Yeah.
4254440	4255440	We'll need those.
4255440	4256440	Oh, sorry.
4256440	4257440	Phil Vamp.
4257440	4258440	Vamp everybody.
4258440	4259440	Vamp.
4259440	4260440	Dungeons and Dragons music.
4260440	4261440	Oh yeah.
4261440	4262440	Exactly.
4262440	4263440	Kind of.
4263440	4264440	Yeah.
4264440	4265440	Middle Earth.
4265440	4266440	Thank God Dick Wolf is here.
4266440	4271440	Oh, the eye of Sauron sees everything, but she doesn't see my lady.
4271440	4276440	Oh, when a penny falls from heaven.
4276440	4278440	I got an orc for a nickel.
4278440	4279440	Can I?
4279440	4285800	I got a gold-plated sword, but I'm going to practice black magic, but I can't keep the
4285800	4289080	black magic in my mind.
4289080	4298360	Got a lady on my corner with a nickel in my border.
4298360	4299360	Look at these things.
4299360	4300360	They're tax forms.
4300360	4302960	I mean, you don't have to understand them.
4302960	4303960	That's the beauty of it.
4303960	4305120	Well, why do you give them to me?
4305120	4306120	Because it's my job.
4306120	4307120	Thank you.
4307120	4308120	That's very kind.
4308120	4310120	You're, you're really by the books.
4310120	4311120	I'm fucking hippy.
4311120	4313320	The only, I'm the job guy.
4313320	4314320	Fuck.
4314320	4315320	All right.
4315320	4316320	I guess I can't do this.
4316320	4317320	D&D.
4317320	4318800	Here we go.
4318800	4319800	Music me.
4319800	4325440	Give me something really dark and fantasy like Lord of the Rings.
4325440	4326440	Yeah.
4326440	4327440	Yeah.
4327440	4328440	All right.
4328440	4329440	I haven't prepared anything.
4329440	4333640	So this is just off the top.
4333640	4341320	When we last met, our heroes were on the ghost way, a perilous path forged by ghosts
4341320	4346000	wrought completely in darkness and without vision.
4346000	4351840	Our heroes accomplished the feat of getting across a pit trap without having eyes.
4351840	4359360	But then Christopher realized he had goggles of night and the gang found their way to vision
4359360	4360720	using their vision.
4360720	4367300	They got to the end of the ghost way where their path was barred by a ghostly portcullis.
4367300	4375680	The portcullis was made quick work of by Krista Berg's roguery skills.
4375680	4379840	And the gang was out following the cave.
4379840	4384640	Little baskins let them know that they would get quite cold and chilly and they would need
4384640	4385960	some warm skin.
4385960	4392120	So they thought to get themselves some leather off the backs of Rhinocerae.
4392120	4401500	And the gang with great gusto attacked Rhinocerae and murdered them for their flesh skins.
4401500	4406600	After leaving the cave, our heroes found themselves in yet another graveyard.
4406600	4409000	But the graveyard was not alone.
4409000	4416680	Whatever they were encountered by Double Hand the Fighter and Onius the Skullborne.
4416680	4424180	Two gnolls claiming revenge for the murder of their bloodmate yurched the gnoll.
4424180	4430440	But as our foes drew up their powerful magics, would our heroes be able to truly win the
4430440	4436020	day, fight others, or kill shit?
4436020	4441060	Find out next time on a Harman Town episode.
4441060	4452000	Yeah, the end.
4452000	4454680	How much time do we have?
4454680	4455680	Nine minutes.
4455680	4456680	Let's get out of here.
4456680	4457680	Nine minutes.
4457680	4458680	All right.
4458680	4459680	Take it.
4459680	4460680	I'm sorry.
4460680	4461680	Take that W2 port.
4461680	4462680	Yes.
4462680	4463680	Thank you.
4463680	4464680	I do need those for reference.
4464680	4466520	I examine my surroundings.
4466520	4474500	You were in a small graveyard occupied by two gnolls, as well as several members of
4474500	4478740	the undead.
4478740	4479740	The undead.
4479740	4480740	Sure.
4480740	4481740	What do you want to do?
4481740	4483060	Everybody go.
4483060	4485260	I use diplomacy.
4485260	4487460	On who?
4487460	4492540	I baffle them with a 1080 form.
4492540	4495220	Who are you diplomasizing?
4495220	4497640	Who are you diplomasizing?
4497640	4504400	One of the gnolls.
4504400	4507600	What do you say to them?
4507600	4508600	Don't fuck with us.
4508600	4510680	A little bit.
4510680	4516740	Your words are convincing.
4516740	4519600	It's a great game.
4519600	4520600	It's a great game.
4520600	4521840	I want to like it.
4521840	4524240	I just don't know how.
4525240	4526240	Just try harder.
4526240	4529240	I mean, it looks like homework.
4529240	4532980	Well, don't look at it like that.
4532980	4536300	Well, make it colorful next time.
4536300	4539800	It's all black and white, and it's got grids, and it's maturing.
4539800	4542380	That's an easy problem to solve, my friend.
4542380	4543380	Exactly.
4543380	4544980	You knew I was going to be here tonight.
4544980	4545980	I didn't.
4545980	4546980	I did not.
4546980	4547980	Oh, you didn't?
4547980	4548980	I did not.
4548980	4549980	All right.
4549980	4550980	Diplomacy successful.
4550980	4554800	I didn't anyone talk to anyone around here.
4554800	4557240	The gnolls, the gnolls.
4557240	4558400	They start speaking.
4558400	4562880	They're like, holy shit, that's a really convincing argument.
4562880	4570880	Well, I guess you got to tell us why you killed our fucking pac mate because he was a great
4570880	4573680	friend to us, and you murdered him.
4573680	4575280	I'll answer that.
4575280	4576280	Will you?
4576280	4577600	Who are you?
4577600	4580960	I'm Sharpie Butz a lot.
4581960	4587960	He sure is.
4587960	4594120	And I've been through a great deal with this group, and I've remembered 40% of it.
4594120	4595120	That's generous.
4595120	4601280	And I say to you that your friend, as much as he was an ally to you, he was an ally to
4601280	4602360	me.
4602360	4610560	And as much as you would have felt betrayed by him succumbing to blood magic, I felt betrayed.
4610560	4615080	And I smote him for his crimes, as you would have smitten him.
4615080	4617080	I wouldn't have smitten him.
4617080	4619440	I wouldn't have done that.
4619440	4624440	I wouldn't have done that because that was his mission to steal the blood book.
4624440	4627800	And all we need is that blood book, and you fucking have it.
4627800	4629400	And I'm going to murder your ass.
4629400	4630960	You're going to murder my ass?
4630960	4633840	You don't even read that book.
4633840	4637120	It's not a book you read.
4637120	4642480	Motherfucker, the last guy that read it turned into a shit bird that I killed.
4642480	4644680	Because you killed him.
4644680	4647440	Because reading it doesn't get you anywhere.
4647440	4649320	Oh shit.
4649320	4651520	Oh, double shit.
4651520	4655400	Well then, can I have it?
4655400	4656400	You want the blood book?
4656400	4659640	Yeah, that's literally why our good friends die.
4659640	4666440	Sharpie, I wave my sap over my fucking head, and I'm just like, no, you better shit the
4666440	4670040	fuck up, or I'm going to fucking whack you on top of the fucking head.
4670040	4671760	Listen to this, motherfucker.
4671760	4673480	I'm just fucking wheeled.
4673480	4675080	I'm wheeling it around like this.
4675080	4677320	This just sounds like so much drunken babble.
4677320	4683340	But the sap you have is no longer full of lead powder, and is thus a simple leather
4683340	4684340	sack.
4684340	4685340	Yeah, but keep waving it, though.
4685340	4686340	Keep waving.
4686340	4687340	It's threatening.
4687340	4688340	It's threatening.
4688340	4689340	I am an 80-year-old man.
4689340	4696320	I don't know what everyone's talking about.
4696320	4699160	Get off my lawn.
4699160	4700800	You're on my lawn, bitch.
4700800	4702840	I feel like you should roll for that.
4702840	4703840	Your mic doesn't work.
4703840	4705480	Can we get her a new mic?
4705480	4707480	Yeah, my mic is on.
4707480	4708480	Here, use mine.
4708480	4711880	No, for God's sake, use mine.
4711880	4717320	All right, say the thing.
4717320	4719320	Say the thing.
4719320	4722200	I'm so sorry, Audie.
4722200	4723200	I died.
4723200	4725600	Well, now that one doesn't work.
4725600	4726600	Yeah.
4726600	4727600	Oh, there we go.
4727600	4728600	Here we go.
4728600	4737800	All right, so thank you for waving that sap around your head.
4737800	4739240	I wanted to protect you.
4739240	4740240	I appreciate it.
4740240	4741240	I felt protected.
4741240	4744240	I feel like we should have rolled for get off my lawn.
4744240	4746320	I mean, it wasn't very convincing.
4746320	4748320	All right.
4748320	4749320	Listen.
4749320	4750320	Hey.
4750320	4751320	Oh, Jesus.
4751320	4752320	Listen.
4752320	4753320	I'm listening.
4753520	4754520	Listen.
4754520	4757520	I'm listening.
4757520	4762520	The Blood Magic book obviously rests in better hands with me.
4762520	4763520	Does it?
4763520	4766760	Does it?
4766760	4771640	Every null hand it's been in has been corrupted.
4771640	4773280	That's one set of hands.
4773280	4776760	It's not a trend.
4776760	4777760	Not a trend.
4777760	4780040	I love Dino.
4780040	4782600	So here we have two sets of data.
4782600	4783760	I mean, what are you doing?
4783760	4787960	I will pay you money.
4787960	4792120	I will pay you blood.
4792120	4798480	Sharpie, so we're back.
4798480	4799480	We do need money.
4799480	4800480	Okay.
4800480	4801480	All right.
4801480	4802480	You know what?
4802480	4803480	You tried to loot.
4803480	4804480	You tried to loot a lot of times.
4804480	4805480	Okay.
4805480	4806480	You know what?
4806480	4807480	You're right.
4807480	4808480	What am I doing?
4808480	4809480	What am I doing?
4809480	4810480	I've never used a book.
4810480	4811480	How much do you operate?
4811500	4820000	I will not kill you and I will give you 7,000 gold pieces.
4820000	4827560	Make it, make it, make it 14,000 and I won't kill you.
4827560	4834320	You know, you know what?
4834320	4835320	You know what?
4835320	4836320	6,000.
4836320	4837320	17,000.
4837320	4851440	I'm, I'm, I'm, your negotiations are failing.
4851440	4852440	My brother.
4852440	4853440	No, yours are.
4853440	4867680	No, they, no, no, yours are, yours are failing.
4867680	4868800	No, yours are.
4868800	4870800	You're surrounded by skeletons.
4870800	4873640	You're you're surrounded by skeletons.
4873640	4875640	Can I heal Starburns?
4875640	4876640	Yes.
4876640	4877640	Yes.
4877640	4881000	I'm going to, I'm going to heal Starburns.
4881000	4882000	You do that.
4882000	4883000	Who is Starburns?
4883000	4884000	16 health.
4884000	4885000	That's Quark.
4885000	4886000	Quark is.
4886000	4887000	Quark.
4887000	4888000	Oh yeah.
4888000	4889000	Metagaming.
4889000	4890000	Sorry.
4890000	4891400	16 health to Quark.
4891400	4895000	You feel you haven't made any headway in this negotiation.
4895000	4897840	All right.
4897840	4902880	So, so he's, he's saying 6,000 man.
4902880	4905280	I'm saying 9,000.
4905280	4908680	Well 9,000 I can do.
4908680	4910680	I mean 9,000.
4910680	4911880	Yeah.
4911880	4914400	We can afford a resurrection.
4914400	4915400	Holy shit, man.
4915400	4916400	Wait.
4916400	4919880	No, I give you 9,000.
4919880	4925160	I still have enough money for a resurrection.
4925160	4927040	I'll take 9,000.
4927040	4928040	Here's your blood book.
4928040	4929040	All right.
4929040	4931600	You convinced him successfully.
4931600	4937880	This couldn't have happened if I was sober.
4937880	4941080	He would, do you offer the book?
4941080	4942080	Yep.
4942080	4947840	He gives you a sack of whatever that agreed a pound amount was.
4947840	4948840	What?
4948840	4951560	He gives you the amount of money he agreed upon.
4951560	4953800	Whatever that amount was.
4953800	4958440	No, I give, I feel like it was 9,000.
4958440	4961520	We agreed on a, yeah 9,000.
4961520	4962520	I give him the book.
4962520	4968440	Well, if you see your July, don't be surprised because we're bringing him back.
4968440	4978200	Hey, if you see my dick, be surprised because it's supposed to be in my pants.
4978200	4980600	I would have gone to 15,000.
4980600	4982760	I would have gone to 15,000.
4982760	4984080	I would have murdered you.
4984080	4986040	I would have done all kinds of stuff.
4986040	4989520	Well, I feel like I saved $6,000 and my life just now.
4989520	4990520	No, you didn't.
4990520	4995080	Because you offered 7,000 and I jacked it up to 14 and we came down at 9.
4995080	4996080	I fucked you.
4996080	5000120	I fucked you.
5000120	5001120	You fucked me.
5001120	5002120	You fucked me.
5002120	5003120	You fucked me.
5003120	5007760	I'm going to walk backwards out of this situation with my hands up.
5007760	5013400	I'm going to walk backwards with my dick out.
5013400	5018680	Walking backward with your dick out, you realize that this truly was the best way to solve
5018680	5019680	this scenario.
5019680	5020680	Yeah!
5020680	5021680	Chicago!
5021680	5038440	The Windy City, the capital of Illinois, no matter what they say.
5038440	5042520	A great city by a great lake.
5042520	5047200	Dino Stamatopoulos, your guest captain.
5047200	5051960	Spencer Crittenden, your dungeon master.
5051960	5052960	Joe Dirt, your...
5052960	5053960	What was your name?
5053960	5054960	Greg.
5054960	5055960	Greg?
5055960	5056960	Greg.
5056960	5057960	Chicago!
5057960	5061960	What was your name, young lady?
5061960	5062960	Jenny.
5062960	5063960	Jenny.
5063960	5066840	Jenny, the neurologist, racist.
5066840	5068120	All of you.
5068120	5069120	All of you.
5069120	5074240	The Music Box Theater, eat that popcorn.
5074240	5077120	And I will be at Cullen's.
5077120	5079400	That's the place, Cullen's.
5079400	5086320	And I'll shake your hand and take your selfies and touch you and hug you.
5086320	5087320	Thank you.
5087320	5087320
