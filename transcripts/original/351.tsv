59000	60000	Oh, shit.
60000	61000	Oh, damn.
61000	64000	Maybe the one by two.
64000	65000	Anywhere you like, Rob.
65000	75000	Let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
75000	78000	Damn.
78000	81000	Yeah.
81000	85000	Who changed that curtain?
85000	87000	Yeah, the curtains are different.
87000	88000	Curtain changer.
88000	89000	It's curtains.
89000	91000	Why are that curtain changer?
91000	93000	Or rehire them.
93000	95000	Change it back.
95000	98000	I like my curtains.
98000	101000	I like my cur- oh.
101000	102000	Damn.
102000	103000	Wait.
103000	107000	I have no, I have no thingy for my iPhone here.
107000	108000	You have a thingy.
108000	110000	It's just the wrong thingy.
110000	111000	Yeah.
111000	112000	Fuck it.
112000	113000	We're going to rely on Zach.
113000	118000	Zach, whenever we need a beat, I'm going to give you the finger and we're going to go.
118000	119000	Huh?
119000	121000	The whole adapter's singing.
121000	123000	Steve Levy, everybody.
123000	126000	Steve Levy.
126000	127000	Steve Levy.
127000	128000	I see.
128000	130000	How are you feeling, Dan?
130000	131000	I'm feeling good.
131000	132000	I'm looking at your face.
132000	134000	Well, I just, I've kind of like-
134000	135000	Constipated?
135000	136000	No, I just don't know.
136000	140000	Like, Jeff's kind of a wild card and I'm like, he's like, I can't plug my phone in.
140000	141000	Is it upside down?
141000	142000	What's happening?
142000	143000	Yeah.
143000	146000	I only have two things I'm excited about.
146000	149000	The pretzel bacon king.
149000	154000	And the new phenomenon that is, well, the pretzel bacon king, whatever.
154000	155000	You get the idea.
155000	159000	It's a goddamn Burger King burger that looks like on the pretzel bun.
159000	163000	I'm just, I want to rob a bank.
163000	164000	I don't have to, but I just-
164000	166000	I don't need fast food, but that thing looks really good.
166000	167000	God damn it.
167000	171000	Pretzel bun, like, first of all, big pretzel bun guy.
171000	174000	Is there anybody who's like, like anti pretzel bun?
174000	177000	Like if you're on a plane and they come by with the basket and they're like, what kind
177000	178000	of bun do you want?
178000	179000	And there's a pretzel bun in there.
179000	182000	Is anybody like, first of all, fuck that shit.
182000	185000	Rob Shropp, everybody!
189000	192000	I'm a, I have a gluten allergy.
192000	193000	Oh.
194000	196000	So I can't eat pretzel bread, but I-
196000	198000	Or any bread.
198000	200000	Do you actually have a gluten allergy though?
200000	201000	Yeah, I have celiac.
201000	202000	Oh shit.
202000	204000	When did that happen?
204000	208000	Like apparently like when I was born, I guess.
208000	209000	I don't know.
209000	211000	How's that working out?
211000	212000	For me, not good.
212000	214000	I hate it because apparently I love-
214000	217000	He's doing his own Tyler Durden dialogue.
219000	220000	I can't remember.
220000	222000	But pretzel bread is the shit.
222000	223000	Yeah, it's great.
223000	224000	So-
224000	225000	And this is bacon.
225000	228000	I'm saying for the first time in my life, I'm jealous of you.
228000	230000	Can I put my phone here?
230000	231000	Yeah.
231000	233000	You could sit here if you want.
233000	236000	No, I just want- you didn't invite me out.
236000	239000	I'm sitting behind the curtain like an idiot.
239000	240000	I was saving you.
240000	241000	Like a piece of shit.
241000	243000	I was saving you.
243000	245000	I told the audience we got too much sugar.
245000	246000	We got Robbie.
246000	247000	Robbie, how you doing Robbie?
247000	248000	I'm real good.
248000	249000	You have a mic.
249000	251000	No, there's mics everywhere.
251000	252000	Yeah, I'm doing good things.
252000	253000	All right, good to see you.
253000	254000	All right, we're all checked in.
254000	258000	The only other thing I'm excited about is just the growing phenomenon of the people
258000	263000	tweeting videos of guys sleeping in their Teslas on the freeway.
264000	265000	What?
265000	269000	Everybody keeps driving by and these guys are just like nah-dah-dah behind their wheel
269000	270000	of their Tesla.
270000	273000	And what I love about it is it's like, well, that's amazing.
273000	275000	I don't blame those people for taking the video.
275000	276000	I don't blame them for posting it.
276000	278000	They're like, here's something you don't see every day.
278000	279000	Sign of the times.
279000	283000	This fucking dude is just asleep in his car on the freeway.
283000	289000	What I find amazing is like you go down the rabbit hole of the response that it evokes
289000	294000	and it's hilarious to me that it's like you have to have a war over whether this sleepy
294000	298000	Tesla guy is a sign of it's everything is zero sum.
298000	301000	Like so the first people will be like, oh, real great.
301000	303000	Yeah, just what we need.
303000	307000	Like more fucking bullshit on the freeway.
308000	312000	And then other people will be like, oh no, looks like a pretty good fucking beta test
312000	313000	to me.
314000	316000	And they're like, beta check, you fuck.
316000	318000	You fucking what if there was a baby on the freeway?
318000	320000	I think the car might stop.
321000	322000	Maybe wake him up.
322000	324000	What the fuck did you do today?
325000	327000	And people just go to war.
327000	329000	They're going to war over a fucking blender.
329000	332000	Like you can't find middle ground here.
332000	334000	The march of time ain't going to stop.
334000	336000	Cars going to drive.
336000	337000	Cars going to drive.
337000	339000	The guy shouldn't be asleep.
341000	343000	The guy should not be asleep behind the wheel.
343000	348000	I'm going to tell you as a Tesla owner, I have spent what the amount of time I am willing
348000	354000	to be behind the wheel with my eyes closed has spiked dramatically.
354000	363000	The reason is because formerly knowing that you're in a car that will absolutely stop
363000	367000	sooner than your foot would stop if anything in front of it.
367000	369000	Jesus fucking Christ.
377000	379000	Guys, please welcome our guest for tonight.
379000	381000	Well, Robbie Folks is here.
381000	386000	He's also our guest for tonight.
386000	389000	Do you want him to play?
389000	398000	I don't want to put Robbie on the spot, but instead of me playing one of my stupid little clips of music,
398000	401000	do you want to play our guest on, Robbie?
401000	403000	Whoa.
403000	408000	Do you need maybe Dan's boom mic for your guitar?
408000	409000	This will probably be it.
409000	411000	Dan, give him your boom.
411000	413000	Dan, give him your boom.
414000	424000	Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to meet the person who created the only show that's
424000	428000	better than anything I've ever done.
428000	431000	Oh, man.
431000	439000	He's both a mentor and a friend and a enemy.
439000	440000	Whoa.
440000	444000	I just threw that in because it seems more Spanish.
444000	448000	Please welcome Mitch Hurwitz.
458000	460000	Hello, Mitch.
460000	462000	Oh, it's freshly rubbed.
462000	464000	Sorry, I was back there waiting for Rob's introduction.
464000	465000	Yeah, yeah.
465000	467000	Like that ever going to happen.
467000	470000	Yeah, what a bummer it is that he got short shrift, huh?
470000	471000	I'm just ruining.
471000	476000	I'm so sad when Rob doesn't get what's due him on this show.
476000	479000	But thanks for coming, Emmy winner, Mitch Mitchell.
479000	480000	No, please.
480000	481000	Come on.
481000	482000	Don't you dare.
482000	483000	Did I wreck it?
483000	484000	No, no, no.
484000	485000	Oh, is this the one you dropped?
485000	486000	No.
486000	488000	Hey, did you get the breadbasket that we sent over?
488000	489000	The...
492000	495000	I was listening.
495000	496000	No fair listening.
496000	498000	Here's what's wrong with the pretzel bread.
498000	501000	I mean, this isn't a little controversial and, you know,
501000	503000	it's a difficult time now to go out on a limb like this,
503000	507000	but it can be dry, right?
507000	511000	You can have a pretzel bun on a burger and it can be too dry.
511000	512000	Okay.
512000	514000	Wow.
514000	516000	Shots fired.
516000	517000	All right.
517000	520000	I've never experienced a pretzel bun too dry.
520000	522000	They're normally buttery and soft.
522000	525000	Well, I don't know, you know, maybe I'm on the private flights
525000	527000	and they don't give you the good ones or something.
527000	528000	I don't...
528000	530000	Oh, shit.
530000	533000	See, why is your Arrested Development private airline
533000	535000	giving you dry pretzel bread?
535000	537000	Well, it was a bad investment.
537000	538000	No, no, no.
538000	539000	It was fucked up.
539000	541000	And I kind of thought the show's going to go forever.
541000	546000	And, you know, it's like I'm starting a streaming network
546000	548000	and now it's like another bad investment.
548000	551000	It's like of all times to start a streaming network.
551000	553000	No, you've been working at Netflix all this time
553000	555000	and then you went and started a streaming network.
555000	557000	I want to start with because they've had such great luck with it.
557000	558000	Right.
558000	561000	And I thought, you know, and then I thought,
561000	563000	you know, what's not out there?
563000	565000	And I thought, well, like, add...
565000	566000	Well, there's too much content.
566000	567000	Right.
567000	568000	So there's not a lot of content.
568000	569000	Okay.
569000	571000	Now I'm following it.
571000	572000	And it's got two tiers.
572000	573000	Oh.
573000	574000	Yeah.
574000	576000	Like advertising is $4 a month.
576000	577000	Okay.
577000	580000	And then like more advertising is like $6 a month.
581000	583000	That sounds like our business model.
583000	584000	Yeah.
584000	585000	Yeah.
585000	586000	It's good.
586000	587000	Which is why we're ending the show soon.
587000	588000	Yeah.
588000	589000	Because it doesn't make any sense.
589000	590000	Yeah.
590000	592000	We'd love to have you do nothing on it at some point.
592000	593000	Because we're not into content.
593000	596000	That's not our thing.
596000	598000	What have you generated over at Netflix?
598000	599000	Did they give you like an overall deal?
599000	600000	I was real jealous.
600000	604000	I did have an overall deal.
604000	606000	And there wasn't much to be jealous about.
606000	609000	I mean, it was nice to be able to use the pool whenever I wanted.
609000	610000	Right.
610000	611000	The Netflix pool.
611000	612000	That was good.
612000	613000	I feel like the shape just seems to not...
613000	614000	I get it.
614000	615000	It has to be an N.
615000	616000	Yeah.
616000	618000	But that doesn't help with swimming.
618000	619000	No.
619000	620000	Yeah.
620000	621000	No, it was great.
621000	622000	They do a lot of things.
622000	623000	Their spa is great.
623000	626000	And their restaurants obviously are worth it.
626000	628000	But I did a couple of things over there.
628000	631000	And then I spent a lot of time bringing back Arrested Development.
631000	635000	And then ruing that decision.
635000	636000	But I won't get into that.
636000	637000	Why did you rue that decision?
637000	638000	No, I didn't.
638000	639000	He won't get into it.
639000	640000	I won't get into it.
640000	641000	He won't get into it.
641000	643000	Nobody looks good in this story.
643000	644800	Bitch, nobody's listening to this.
644800	646920	Just tell us why you rued that decision.
646920	648920	The show is dying.
648920	649920	Nobody cares anymore.
649920	651160	No one's been fired for things that haven't here before.
651160	652160	We're getting canceled.
652160	653160	You're getting...
653160	654160	Yeah.
654160	655160	We're getting canceled.
655160	656160	Yeah.
656160	658200	And you were gonna announce your comeback tour, right?
658200	659200	Tonight you're gonna...
659200	660200	Yeah.
660200	661200	Excuse me.
661200	662200	What?
662200	663200	Sorry.
663200	664200	Sorry.
664200	665200	Sorry.
665200	666200	What?
666200	667200	What?
667900	668900	Awesome.
668900	669900	Okay.
669900	670900	Anyways, continue with the podcast.
670900	671900	Three Suzanne's.
671900	672900	Oh, shit.
672900	673900	And an Emmy.
673900	674900	Oh.
674900	678040	I can remember everybody has a little spot for their drink.
678040	681700	You can have this table or, yeah, I feel bad for you.
681700	682700	Have you met Grammy-winning...
682700	684700	Jeff's doing something.
684700	685700	Singer-songwriter?
685700	686700	Oh, no.
686700	687700	Oh, did you win a Grammy?
687700	691200	Oh, look at that.
691200	692200	We have a distinct...
692200	693200	That's so nice.
693200	694200	Is that low enough?
694200	695200	That's so nice.
696200	697200	Can I get a higher chair?
697200	700200	Yeah, we can put it on the floor if you want.
701200	702200	Hey, Mitch, are you a singer at all?
702200	704200	Do you like to sing music?
704200	705200	Are you kidding me?
705200	707200	I smell the segue.
707200	709200	That's my first love, is singing music.
709200	710200	Is it really?
710200	711200	Yes.
711200	712200	No, I don't sing.
712200	714200	But I will, if that would be appropriate.
714200	718200	No, I mean, I just don't want to waste our Robbie folks on the crowd here right now.
718200	719200	Oh, well, no.
719200	721200	You want to play something and I'll just scap?
721200	722200	Yeah.
723200	725200	No, I wouldn't dare.
725200	726200	Wait, no.
726200	727200	Dank.
727200	728200	Oh, there you go.
733200	736200	Well, I don't want to appropriate the scat.
737200	741200	From the people who gave it to us, not the people.
741200	743200	But you know what I mean.
746200	747200	Let's put it up.
747200	748200	Is that easy?
748200	749200	That's your next Grammy.
749200	750200	Is that easy?
751200	752200	That's your next Grammy.
752200	753200	Wow.
753200	754200	That was great.
754200	755200	I've never heard Woke Scat before.
755200	756200	No, it's really.
757200	758200	Post-Woke Scat?
758200	759200	Post-appropriate.
759200	761200	That's a great name for a scat singer.
761200	762200	Woke Scat?
762200	763200	Woke Scat.
764200	772200	I got no right to make a sound that isn't very restrained in coming through a sphincter of privilege.
774200	776200	Hey, let's enjoy white privilege while we have it.
776200	777200	I know.
777200	778200	Like, oh, that's the thing.
778200	780200	I don't understand why white people get so upset about it.
780200	781200	Here's the problem.
781200	783200	We haven't been enjoying our privilege enough.
784200	785200	Why haven't we been privileged?
785200	787200	We just haven't enjoyed it.
787200	788200	The white privilege.
788200	790200	Here's the thing that white people don't understand.
791200	800200	When you're told that you have privilege, you're socialized to understand that that precedes shit getting taken from you.
800200	801200	Right.
801200	803200	But society doesn't work by those rules.
803200	805200	Like, people can just say, hey, you've got privilege.
805200	807200	And you can be like, thanks.
808200	809200	And you don't have to do shit.
809200	811200	You don't even have to thank them, actually.
812200	818200	I was driving next to a cop over here for a while, and I noticed that...
818200	821200	Well, first I noticed I was trying to be a very good citizen.
821200	825200	You know, that thing where the cops is next to you and you're just trying to show that you're...
825200	826200	No, go ahead.
826200	827200	No, I would let this guy go.
827200	828200	Yeah.
828200	829200	I'm not...
829200	830200	Like, why?
830200	831200	You're going to be an asshole.
831200	832200	I'm not shoplifting.
832200	835200	And then I really did think, like, no, fuck it.
835200	837200	You know, this is a good opportunity for white privilege.
837200	840200	Like, let me be a little bit of an asshole and see what happens.
840200	843200	And, you know, so I pretended I was on the phone just saying, like,
843200	845200	are you fucking kidding me?
845200	847200	Look over to the cop.
851200	852200	That part's not true.
852200	857200	But I really did notice, like, why am I my best behavior here?
857200	858200	Yeah.
858200	860200	Everything you're reading is...
862200	864200	I once told the cop to go fuck himself.
864200	865200	And I...
865200	866200	Like, that's...
866200	868200	If that's not white privilege, then nothing is.
868200	869200	Yeah.
869200	870200	Yeah.
870200	873200	I one time picked up...
873200	875200	I was walking my dog.
875200	877200	And in our neighborhood, the police said,
877200	878200	Excuse me.
878200	879200	All right.
879200	880200	Excuse me.
880200	881200	That's how it works.
881200	882200	This is the aftershocks.
882200	883200	God damn it.
883200	884200	This is the aftershocks.
884200	885200	No, no, no.
885200	886200	This is the blowback.
886200	887200	No, the guy got a nickel put in him.
887200	889200	So he's going to keep doing that until eventually he pukes and falls over.
889200	890200	Sorry.
890200	891200	And then it's like...
891200	892200	No, no, no.
892200	893200	Go on.
893200	897200	If you can find it within you, just please shut up.
897200	899200	No matter how much that tempts you to keep talking,
899200	900200	like, you got to...
900200	902200	You're in a different zone than the rest of us.
902200	905200	There's, like, a bunch of people that pay money to be at the show.
905200	907200	This is the Andrew Yang rally,
907200	911200	where everybody just screams their heads off.
911200	912200	Like, it's the Roman Coliseum.
912200	914200	I should probably take care of it.
914200	915200	I should probably take care of it.
915200	917200	Go on, Rob.
917200	922200	I told a rando with nothing to contribute that he shouldn't talk,
922200	925200	so now make this count.
925200	926200	Okay.
926200	928200	So I'm walking my dog.
928200	929200	I'm walking my dog.
929200	932200	In our neighborhood, the police have been killing civilians, okay?
932200	933200	Right.
933200	935200	And so I'm walking the dog.
935200	936200	I'm walking the dog.
936200	942200	And, you know, like, sometimes when they bring out, like, the garbage,
942200	944200	you know, it's sitting there and you're walking the dog
944200	945200	and you get the bag of shit and you're like,
945200	947200	ooh, bonus, I don't have to...
947200	948200	Sure.
948200	949200	I don't have to turn the corner.
949200	950200	I can just put it right there.
950200	951200	You know?
951200	953200	And I'm walking, I'm walking, I'm walking, and I miss it.
953200	957200	And then I go, oh, I should turn around and throw the dog shit away.
957200	961200	And as I was turning around and putting my arm up,
961200	966200	a police car with the window open drove by at the same time.
966200	967200	So it looked like...
967200	971200	And forgive me for people who don't have the visual of this.
971200	973200	So it looks like me, like, going...
973200	976200	Like, if you're the cop, I'm like...
976200	977200	Like this.
977200	978200	Oh, my God.
978200	979200	So it just...
979200	983200	Because I was walking this way and then I do a sharp turn with my hand up
983200	985200	with a bag and, you know, in our neighborhood,
985200	988200	somebody had a towel in his hand and got his face blown off.
988200	991200	Yeah, you got to turn that into, like, a Blue Lives Matter.
991200	992200	Yes.
992200	993200	You know, he's right there.
993200	996200	And the cop, and the cop, like, went like this.
996200	997200	Oh, Jesus.
997200	1000200	Oh, my God, I could have been killed right now.
1000200	1001200	You could have been killed.
1001200	1003200	That's basically what happened to that guy.
1003200	1004200	Right.
1004200	1005200	Totally the same thing.
1005200	1006200	God damn it, sir.
1007200	1008200	Front row.
1008200	1009200	Raise your hand.
1009200	1010200	Who's the guy?
1010200	1011200	Raise your hand.
1011200	1012200	He can't.
1012200	1013200	Okay.
1013200	1014200	He raises his hand.
1014200	1015200	His leg is going to go up.
1015200	1016200	But stop it.
1016200	1017200	I'll come over there and come for you.
1017200	1019200	I don't think his leg is going to go up.
1019200	1020200	No, I know.
1020200	1022200	Look, I know you guys don't get along.
1022200	1027200	But I don't think that his brain controls his arm and his leg at the same time.
1027200	1029200	Well, I'm just thinking, like, what...
1029200	1031200	It's like the Three Stooges when they're plumbers, you know?
1031200	1033200	Like, if you flush the toilet, the shower goes.
1033200	1034200	I'm just...
1034200	1038200	Isn't that why if you were in an audience and you're not supposed to talk, you'd be
1038200	1039200	like, I'm talking.
1039200	1040200	I mean, it's possible.
1040200	1042200	It's that thing that people...
1042200	1046200	Now that our show is dying and we're going to be done soon, I think people just want
1046200	1049200	to be Adam Goldberg at the buzzer.
1049200	1056200	What if I can be the last person that the whole crowd hated and we all learned that
1056200	1057200	person's name?
1057200	1061200	Well, if that wasn't the case, it's certainly going to be the case now.
1061200	1062200	Yeah.
1062200	1063200	I don't think that guy fits in that category.
1063200	1064200	No, I think...
1064200	1065200	Because he's not going...
1065200	1067200	Actually, I work in data processing.
1067200	1072200	He's going, like, volume up, change the channel, discovery.
1072200	1074200	He's not here right now.
1074200	1076200	He belongs home and he's here.
1076200	1078200	He's got a backpack full of explosives.
1078200	1079200	We're all going to die.
1079200	1080200	Well, I think we're the...
1080200	1081200	We're not all going to die.
1081200	1083200	Most of us are going to die.
1083200	1084200	That's really smart.
1084200	1085200	Otherwise, that's against the law.
1085200	1086200	Right.
1086200	1087200	You can't say, we're all going to die.
1087200	1088200	Yeah.
1088200	1089200	Yeah, there's explosives.
1089200	1091200	Legally, I can only say that some of us are going to die.
1091200	1093200	Yeah, you can say, there's a small fire.
1093200	1095200	And, you know, some people would leave.
1095200	1096200	Thank you.
1096200	1097200	But you can't say there's a...
1097200	1101200	You can say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1101200	1103200	That's what's going to happen every four minutes.
1103200	1104200	It's going to get, like...
1104200	1105200	Oh, he's doing great.
1105200	1106200	He's on his side.
1106200	1107200	All right.
1107200	1108200	Why are you on his side?
1108200	1109200	I just think we have to praise him.
1109200	1110200	Here's the thing, too.
1110200	1112200	This is the scariest part about it.
1112200	1113200	I forgot my wallet.
1113200	1115200	You think he's got it?
1115200	1116200	No, no, no.
1116200	1119200	When I almost got shot by the police,
1119200	1121200	the first thing I thought I was like,
1121200	1123200	I forgot my wallet in the house
1123200	1124200	because I'm just going, you know,
1124200	1126200	I'm running out with the dog.
1126200	1129200	I don't need my fucking ID to tell the grass.
1129200	1131200	It's my dog's shit.
1131200	1132200	But now suddenly you're in a situation
1132200	1133200	where you've got to prove to this guy,
1133200	1135200	no, this is my dog's shit.
1135200	1136200	Wait, wait, wait.
1136200	1138200	I was like going to go, they would shoot me,
1138200	1140200	I would be dead, and it would be hours
1140200	1142200	before Kate would even know,
1142200	1144200	even though I'm right outside the house.
1144200	1145200	Right.
1145200	1147200	Michael Stipe killed in Korea town.
1148200	1150200	Yeah!
1150200	1151200	There you go.
1151200	1152200	There you go.
1152200	1153200	Oh, boy.
1153200	1154200	Oh, no.
1154200	1155200	No, no, no.
1155200	1156200	I unleashed it.
1156200	1160200	Countdown to Moby in five, four, three, two...
1160200	1161200	Or Moby, for that matter.
1161200	1162200	Yes!
1162200	1163200	Time to...
1163200	1165200	Oh, God, it looks a little bit like Moby.
1165200	1166200	Did the cops...
1166200	1167200	Was there any kerfuffle?
1167200	1169200	No one ever says Statham, ever.
1169200	1171200	Come on.
1171200	1172200	Way more timely.
1172200	1174200	I'll take the glasses off.
1174200	1175200	Just once.
1175200	1176200	Statham.
1176200	1178200	Hey, Moby, folks.
1178200	1181200	Have you moved permanently to Los Angeles?
1181200	1184200	Are you still a Chicago...
1184200	1186200	We're over in Silver Lake, Jeff.
1186200	1187200	Silver Lake.
1187200	1188200	Silver Lake.
1188200	1189200	Yeah.
1189200	1190200	I'm trying to figure out how I got here.
1190200	1192200	We were just drinking in the drawing room.
1192200	1194200	Yeah, and I dragged you over here.
1194200	1195200	And now we're here, yeah.
1195200	1198200	You may have fallen asleep in your Tesla.
1198200	1199200	Yeah.
1199200	1200200	Do you live here for good,
1200200	1203200	or are you guys just still beta-testing you
1203200	1204200	and Donna, still living out here?
1204200	1205200	I think we're here for good.
1205200	1207200	Yeah, we're in a temporary place, but I think we're...
1207200	1208200	We like it here.
1208200	1209200	It's nice and everything.
1209200	1210200	It's nice.
1210200	1215200	Would you be willing to give us a little more music and we'll...
1215200	1216200	For scatting?
1216200	1217200	Or for...
1217200	1218200	Well, you know, or...
1218200	1220200	Should he have your boom mic, or do we have another one?
1220200	1222200	Why don't you trade Mike's den?
1222200	1224200	He's got his mic in between his legs.
1224200	1226200	He's got this great technique.
1226200	1228200	You're obsessed with booming him.
1228200	1230200	But he has to sing, too.
1230200	1232200	Oh, he has to sing, okay.
1233200	1235200	Yeah, so let's make this work, you guys.
1235200	1236200	He's got this.
1236200	1238200	All right, take a picture.
1240200	1242200	Now, for those of you that don't know Robbie,
1242200	1244200	and I'm gonna pimp him out right now,
1244200	1246200	he is one of my favorite musicians of all time,
1246200	1249200	and I know him through Dino Sematopoulos, our friend.
1249200	1250200	You're from...
1250200	1252200	Where in the South, Robbie?
1252200	1253200	North Carolina.
1253200	1254200	North Carolina.
1254200	1257200	This guy, I'm gonna fucking punch him.
1257200	1260200	This guy is somewhere in the South.
1261200	1263200	That's where he's at.
1263200	1266200	I will remove you, sir, if you keep doing that.
1267200	1270200	But you've lived in Chicago for some good time, right?
1270200	1273200	Yeah, a real long time in Chicago, and yeah.
1274200	1275200	Yeah.
1275200	1277200	Am I doing a song? Is that what I'm doing?
1277200	1279200	Well, now you're being interviewed.
1279200	1281200	Can I sing on with you?
1281200	1283200	You want to start with a Robbie Fox original,
1283200	1284200	or should we sing one together?
1284200	1285200	Oh, we can do one together.
1285200	1287200	Yeah, you want to do that Everly song?
1287200	1288200	We were singing at the drawing room.
1288200	1289200	Okay, yeah, let's try that.
1289200	1290200	I'll do my best.
1290200	1293200	I'll do the melody, and you do the high Everly.
1293200	1294200	I'll give it a shot.
1319200	1328200	It makes me cry to see love die.
1328200	1335200	So sad to watch good love go back.
1338200	1345200	Remember how it used to be a deer?
1345200	1346200	Feel me.
1347200	1354200	You said nothing could change your mind.
1357200	1367200	It breaks my heart to see us part.
1367200	1374200	So sad to watch good love go back.
1374200	1375200	Take the bridge.
1377200	1378200	Yo.
1381200	1389200	Girl, I remember all the times back in the day,
1389200	1395200	you used to fuck around, and it breaks my heart, girl.
1397200	1399200	Don't be like that.
1400200	1406200	It breaks my heart to see a deer.
1410200	1415200	You said nothing could change your mind.
1415200	1416200	I'm all fucked up now, all right.
1416200	1417200	Cop killer.
1418200	1427200	It breaks my heart to see us part.
1427200	1429200	Slinging rocks.
1429200	1436200	So sad to watch good love go back.
1436200	1439200	Special victims unit.
1439200	1449200	So sad to watch good love go back.
1452200	1465200	Who expected Ice-T to come into that song?
1466200	1467200	That was beautiful.
1467200	1470200	Except for the special victims unit part.
1470200	1473200	He doesn't have a right to plug that.
1473200	1474200	No, that's right.
1474200	1478200	But he doesn't care about rules.
1478200	1480200	For him, it's not business.
1480200	1482200	It's about business, isn't it?
1482200	1484200	I think he's changed lately.
1484200	1487200	I think he's decided that now it's personal.
1487200	1489200	Let's bring out Ice-T, everybody.
1489200	1495200	How you doing, Ice-T?
1495200	1500200	I hear that you've been busy on a couple shows?
1500200	1501200	Yeah.
1501200	1504200	But I got shrunk down.
1504200	1507200	I'm baby T.
1507200	1509200	You're lowercase T?
1509200	1513200	I'm a little tiny, little lowercase T.
1519200	1522200	They can't all be gems.
1522200	1525200	You just wore an uppercase T on that one, though.
1525200	1527200	All right.
1527200	1528200	It's just me.
1528200	1529200	Okay.
1529200	1532200	Are you work shopping some new T's, Ice-T?
1532200	1539200	I'm trying to get out of a contract with Sony.
1539200	1547200	You know they invented HDMI just to put digital copyright inside your cords?
1547200	1549200	That ain't personal.
1549200	1552200	That's business.
1552200	1560200	Ain't nothing an HDMI cord does except prevent you from recording Beatles songs.
1560200	1561200	Ice-T, I see.
1561200	1565200	I didn't realize that you were this active on Consumer Advocate.
1565200	1567200	I've been learning about cables.
1567200	1568200	Yeah?
1568200	1573200	I've been crimping my own RG59 coax.
1573200	1577200	SDI, 3G, 6G, damn.
1577200	1586200	I can make Ethernet, 5E, CAT6, CAT6A, 10 gigabytes per second.
1586200	1588200	10 gigabytes per second?
1588200	1589200	Bits, 10 gigabits.
1589200	1590200	Okay.
1590200	1591200	All right?
1591200	1592200	Shit.
1592200	1594200	That shit goes through your walls.
1594200	1595200	It won't degrade.
1595200	1597200	Fuck.
1597200	1600200	You seem like you're kind of in a bad mood about this.
1600200	1606200	You lay a thousand feet of CAT6A cable through the walls of your new Hacienda?
1606200	1609200	You're data ready for 10 years, bitch.
1609200	1610200	All right.
1610200	1611200	Future proof.
1611200	1612200	Okay.
1612200	1615200	You don't have to get personal ad hominem about it.
1615200	1616200	It's not personal.
1616200	1617200	It's business?
1617200	1621200	It's data, which is the future of business.
1621200	1622200	Oh, shit.
1622200	1623200	It's not business anymore.
1623200	1629200	Man, the Internet's going to change everything, and every home's going to be its own Internet.
1630200	1633200	I want to be able to be located in my living room
1633200	1637200	and sell shit to someone from India that's in my bedroom.
1639200	1641200	By capitalism?
1641200	1643200	I mean, hello, too, but...
1644200	1647200	It sounds like the definition of capitalism.
1647200	1649200	But through wires now.
1650200	1651200	Fuck that.
1651200	1655200	I mean, fuck it like good when you like something.
1655200	1656200	Are you still in the music?
1656200	1657200	Are you still recording?
1657200	1660200	Oh, yeah. Me and Body Count, we're doing it hardcore.
1660200	1661200	Oh, yeah?
1661200	1664200	I heard you have a new track for us that is kind of more of a country tip.
1664200	1665200	Yeah.
1665200	1667200	Kind of a bluegrass kind of feel?
1667200	1669200	I mean, if you don't think that's a double beat, yeah.
1669200	1671200	No, but this is more of a bluegrass thing, which is...
1671200	1674200	People don't think that's your wheelhouse, but...
1674200	1675200	Sure.
1675200	1676200	Yeah.
1676200	1677200	What's this one called?
1677200	1679200	The Road to Tea.
1679200	1690200	Well, I've been personal all my life.
1690200	1695200	And I've been eating peas with a knife.
1695200	1700200	I've had spoons and forks in my jeans.
1700200	1704200	But I don't know if you know what I mean.
1704200	1706200	It ain't personal.
1706200	1708200	It's business.
1709200	1714200	It ain't what it seems.
1714200	1717200	It ain't personal.
1717200	1720200	It's business.
1720200	1724200	Down from my shoes up into the...
1724200	1727200	In my inseam.
1727200	1730200	Wow, Mr. T, that's very good.
1730200	1734200	Mr. T, I'm not...
1734200	1737200	I don't know about measures and kind of...
1737200	1740200	It sounds like your man kind of waited for you to find it.
1740200	1742200	Yeah, I appreciate that.
1742200	1747200	Thank you, Robbie, for trying to wait for me and figure it out.
1747200	1749200	But your big mistake was...
1749200	1752200	I ain't gonna figure it out.
1752200	1754200	I'm a wanderer, you know?
1754200	1756200	I'm just like looking at your fingers and being like,
1756200	1759200	damn, let's do this.
1759200	1760200	All right, come on.
1760200	1761200	All right, that's enough.
1761200	1763200	Look, it's an elevator coming down.
1763200	1766200	Bye, iced tea.
1767200	1770200	You started to cross a threshold.
1770200	1772200	It was good...
1772200	1774200	He just kind of...
1774200	1775200	Like Irish exited.
1775200	1776200	He just rolled out.
1776200	1778200	But it was great to have iced tea on the show.
1778200	1780200	No, it's great. It's always great to have...
1780200	1782200	I think he knew more about measurement than he was leading on,
1782200	1786200	because I think inseam, that matters.
1786200	1789200	That's everything in a man's pant.
1789200	1791200	Which I think is what he was doing.
1791200	1795200	In the movies, the inseam is like an illusion to your dick being big.
1795200	1797200	Is that a real thing? What is the inseam?
1797200	1799200	No, it's just that when they measure you up,
1799200	1803200	the tape measure goes from your ankle up to your crotch.
1803200	1806200	And your dick size doesn't change your inseam, right?
1806200	1808200	No, it shouldn't.
1808200	1810200	It shouldn't, yeah.
1810200	1812200	Has yours changed recently?
1812200	1813200	No.
1813200	1814200	Okay, then you're fine.
1814200	1816200	I just think in the movies, they're always like,
1816200	1817200	oh, the inseam.
1817200	1819200	Because there is a kind of swollen crotch,
1819200	1821200	which is not a good thing.
1821200	1823200	And you want to be sure you don't have that.
1823200	1824200	Right.
1824200	1826200	Yeah, you'll need some of that powder.
1826200	1830200	In movies, it's always like these horny Italian tailors.
1830200	1831200	Yeah.
1831200	1833200	Checking out your shit.
1833200	1834200	Yeah.
1834200	1837200	Checking out your crotch.
1842200	1844200	You should do a show called Checking Out Your Crotch,
1844200	1846200	but it'd be like Schitt's Creek,
1846200	1849200	and crotch would be the name of the town.
1850200	1852200	Because that's very popular now.
1852200	1854200	Do you still want to do stuff, Mitch?
1854200	1855200	Sure.
1855200	1856200	Yeah, I do.
1856200	1857200	I don't.
1857200	1858200	Really?
1858200	1859200	Yeah.
1859200	1860200	I'll do some of your stuff.
1860200	1861200	Oh, go ahead.
1861200	1862200	Yeah.
1862200	1863200	Do you want some of my ideas?
1863200	1865200	Do you have any like Schitt's Creek type things?
1865200	1867200	What do I have?
1867200	1869200	I was going to do a show called Motherfuckers,
1869200	1872200	which is this woman who they call Mother,
1872200	1874200	and her last name is Fuckers.
1874200	1876200	And so she's the Motherfuckers.
1876200	1877200	Oh, that's cool.
1877200	1879200	And that way you can say it on TV and stuff.
1880200	1884200	I have like five ideas that are Groundhog Day meets something.
1884200	1885200	Yeah.
1885200	1887200	I know.
1887200	1888200	Is that okay?
1888200	1891200	I'm doing Russian Doll meets Groundhog Day.
1891200	1892200	So I don't know.
1892200	1894200	Maybe it's too close.
1897200	1898200	Do you watch anything?
1898200	1899200	I hate it when people ask me this,
1899200	1902200	but only because the answer is kind of always embarrassingly no,
1902200	1904200	but I have been watching Succession lately.
1904200	1905200	Oh, my God.
1905200	1906200	Do you like Succession?
1906200	1907200	Yeah.
1907200	1908200	And you know why?
1908200	1910200	You haven't discovered Succession yet.
1910200	1911200	I haven't.
1911200	1914200	And I went into it a little bit like defensive.
1914200	1915200	Very jaded.
1915200	1917200	Because it was, I'd been told, you know,
1917200	1918200	it's kind of like the characters.
1918200	1919200	There's even like a Tobias.
1919200	1921200	There's like four kids and all this stuff.
1921200	1922200	And so I kind of went.
1922200	1923200	It is very balut-y.
1923200	1924200	Yeah.
1924200	1926200	It's like Arrested Development, the drama in its conceit.
1926200	1928200	But it's so much funnier than Arrested Development.
1928200	1931200	I mean, it really, it like it won on every point.
1931200	1932200	And now I'm just a fan.
1932200	1933200	I'm a complete fan of that guy.
1933200	1934200	And there's no competition, obviously.
1934200	1935200	Yeah.
1935200	1937200	But I can see how people would be like tweeting you and going like,
1937200	1939200	oh, I looked at bitter when it was this.
1939200	1940200	You know, like, I get that.
1940200	1942200	But no, it's inspired.
1942200	1945200	And I even like the thing at the end where the author,
1945200	1947200	you know, I haven't done one of those shows where at the end
1947200	1949200	you get to talk about the scenes.
1949200	1950200	Oh, I don't wait.
1950200	1952200	You know, like at the end of Game of Thrones.
1952200	1953200	Oh, I never watched this.
1953200	1955200	It's like you get absorbed in the story.
1955200	1956200	And then someone says, you know,
1956200	1958200	when we wrote that scene with the dragon,
1958200	1960200	you're like, ah, ah, fuck.
1960200	1961200	None of it happened.
1961200	1962200	Yeah.
1962200	1963200	You know what I mean?
1963200	1964200	Yeah, I don't watch those.
1964200	1965200	I can't imagine people watching those.
1965200	1966200	Yeah.
1966200	1967200	No, it's kind of takes the fun out of it.
1967200	1968200	Yeah.
1968200	1969200	Because it's like, oh, there's Arya Stark,
1969200	1970200	but she's like drinking a diet Coke.
1970200	1973200	And she's like, oh, yeah, she didn't want to do that scene.
1973200	1975200	She didn't want to kiss him.
1975200	1978200	She's like, here's the three takes where I like jumped in the air
1978200	1980200	with the knife, but then I landed on a cat.
1980200	1981200	Like, like, like, what?
1981200	1982200	This is awful.
1982200	1983200	Why are you doing this to me?
1983200	1984200	I thought you were real.
1984200	1985200	I thought there was an actual game of friends.
1985200	1986200	It's like the network.
1986200	1987200	You thought she was all adults, right?
1987200	1989200	I mean, we all know this is bullshit.
1989200	1990200	Yeah.
1990200	1991200	Fuck this shit.
1991200	1992200	Who's bored?
1992200	1994200	We all know this was just a bunch of shoes riding in a room.
1994200	1995200	I mean, who are we?
1995200	1997200	You know who the real heroes are?
1997200	2000200	The fucking ugly people that had to write this shit.
2000200	2002200	That's a game of thrones.
2002200	2007200	You want to meet a fucking dragon, meet Benjamin, the writer's PA.
2007200	2009200	He's a fucking hairy character.
2009200	2012200	I just want to do one of those, and I want to like really seriously
2012200	2013200	talk about the show.
2013200	2017200	It's just like the most ridiculous show and then just say,
2017200	2019200	well, it's really about loss.
2019200	2022200	We were getting at it.
2022200	2027200	We wanted to explore loss, and that's why we had his penis showing
2027200	2029200	when he bent over like that.
2029200	2034200	The performances, the casting and succession are great.
2034200	2040200	It really is like Cody was watching it just for her own purposes.
2040200	2043200	That's the only way I'm ever going to get hooked into a show
2043200	2046200	because I'm so lazy and I still have talked endlessly about it.
2046200	2049200	I don't know what it is that keeps me away from watching shit,
2049200	2052200	but it's like Cody's got the laptop open.
2052200	2057200	It starts with me hearing dialogue, and I'm so jaded.
2057200	2059200	I'm like, was that supposed to be funny?
2059200	2060200	I don't know.
2060200	2061200	What is it?
2061200	2065200	A dramedy or a tragicama doo-ba-doo-ba-doo?
2065200	2066200	Whatever.
2066200	2067200	Pick a lane.
2067200	2074200	I just have this jaded membrane, and then gradually things will land,
2074200	2076200	and I'll be like, well, what's going on over there?
2077200	2079200	Is that a musical montage or what's happening?
2079200	2083200	What is going on with those housewives, and why won't he show up on time
2083200	2084200	to the party?
2084200	2085200	And then you just get drawn in.
2085200	2086200	What the fuck?
2086200	2087200	They'll bet success.
2087200	2091200	Cody made fun of me because I was like, this show's boring at one point.
2091200	2093200	I almost don't want to say that out loud because it makes me sound
2093200	2097200	like such a fucking douche, but that's how good the show is
2097200	2100200	because it was probably like a couple hours later when I'm like,
2100200	2104200	I got work to do, and I was like, come on, what's the next episode?
2104200	2105200	She's like, oh, the boring show?
2105200	2106200	And I'm like, all right.
2106200	2107200	You got it?
2107200	2108200	Yeah.
2108200	2109200	Fucking like it's riveting.
2109200	2110200	I don't know.
2110200	2111200	Yeah.
2111200	2113200	It's riveting.
2113200	2116200	It doesn't go where you expect it to go.
2116200	2118200	The characters are more nuanced than you'd think.
2118200	2121200	It's just predictable enough to actually be...
2121200	2125200	That's what I really like about it is that it doesn't try to purposely...
2125200	2129200	It doesn't engage in like hot rod unpredictability.
2129200	2131200	It actually gives you perfect...
2131200	2132200	This guy's a junkie.
2132200	2134200	He's going to do what fucking junkies do.
2134200	2135200	And you know how that's going to end up?
2135200	2137200	The way you think it is.
2137200	2142200	But it's like the details are lateral enough that there's a confidence in the...
2142200	2143200	Well, and it's...
2143200	2146200	There is that thing that we don't often get to do in comedy
2146200	2149200	where you leave some things unexplained.
2149200	2151200	In comedy, it's all about you explain everything.
2151200	2153200	You want everybody to get every joke.
2153200	2154200	And that...
2154200	2155200	Oh, wait.
2155200	2157200	Yeah, he's just...
2157200	2159200	I feel like Rob left.
2159200	2162200	He's getting to that age that's like...
2162200	2164200	He has to go every 30 minutes.
2164200	2166200	I think that's why it's wise that you didn't introduce him.
2166200	2167200	Because...
2169200	2170200	Because what for?
2170200	2171200	Yeah.
2176200	2177200	But anyway, yeah.
2177200	2180200	You get to look into the characters' eyes.
2180200	2181200	Is she upset?
2181200	2183200	Is she relieved?
2183200	2184200	I mean, it really is.
2184200	2186200	It's spectacular.
2186200	2187200	Yeah, it's good.
2187200	2188200	You kind of love...
2188200	2189200	I felt that way about Game of Thrones too.
2189200	2191200	I like good dramas that are serialized
2191200	2194200	because you get to pick a character and you go,
2194200	2195200	like, that person's the best.
2195200	2197200	All these other people annoy me.
2197200	2200200	And then you're like, okay, well, that person I also understand.
2200200	2202200	And it kind of settles in like Velcro.
2202200	2203200	And you're like, slowly.
2203200	2205200	They're just like, I love all these fucking assholes.
2205200	2207200	And you're watching a soap opera.
2207200	2208200	And it's great.
2208200	2209200	I was wanting to do a show.
2209200	2210200	I did a show, actually.
2210200	2213200	I did four episodes of a show called Everything's Relative.
2213200	2216200	And the conceit, which NBC didn't quite let me do,
2216200	2219200	was going to be that every episode, another character
2219200	2221200	basically thinks the show's about them.
2221200	2223200	You know, like they're the normal person.
2223200	2225200	Like the Michael Bluth, basically.
2225200	2227200	So, you know, it started off with like the white kid.
2227200	2228200	It was 35.
2228200	2230200	But then the next episode was like the mom.
2230200	2232200	It was just all the mom's point of view.
2232200	2234200	And they kind of do that, in a way.
2234200	2236200	We never had to do the project we were going to do together,
2236200	2238200	which I think we could just open source now,
2238200	2239200	because I'm retired.
2239200	2240200	No, no, let's do it.
2240200	2241200	All right.
2241200	2242200	I have a way to do it.
2242200	2243200	But not at Netflix?
2243200	2244200	No, it doesn't have to be Netflix.
2244200	2245200	Because there's no back end there.
2245200	2246200	I think we should do it on my streaming thing.
2246200	2247200	What's it called?
2247200	2251200	My streaming platform could frankly stand a little contact.
2251200	2253200	You don't have a streaming platform.
2253200	2255200	I'm starting a streaming platform.
2255200	2258200	I'm going to, it's got two tiers.
2258200	2259200	I feel like I mentioned this.
2259200	2261200	The cool thing is it's just your last name,
2261200	2263200	so you don't need to make up a Silicon Valley Google name.
2263200	2264200	No, it's not.
2264200	2265200	It's not the last name.
2265200	2266200	Hurwitz.
2266200	2267200	No, it's not.
2267200	2268200	It's called Netmitch.
2268200	2273200	No, it's Media Master Plus.
2273200	2274200	That's not what you think.
2274200	2275200	It's not what you think.
2275200	2276200	It's not what you think.
2276200	2277200	It's not what you think.
2277200	2278200	What's the name of your show and what's the premise?
2278200	2279200	Give me the elevator pitch.
2279200	2280200	It's not a show.
2280200	2281200	It's a platform.
2281200	2282200	Okay.
2282200	2283200	So that's already your way off.
2283200	2284200	All right.
2284200	2285200	I thought you guys had a-
2285200	2286200	Media Master Plus.
2286200	2287200	Oh, that show.
2287200	2288200	Oh, that show.
2288200	2289200	Yeah.
2289200	2290200	That show.
2290200	2291200	Media Master Plus.
2291200	2292200	The show is a platform.
2292200	2293200	Okay.
2293200	2294200	Okay.
2294200	2295200	Okay.
2295200	2296200	Okay.
2296200	2297200	Okay.
2297200	2298200	Okay.
2298200	2299200	Okay.
2299200	2300200	Okay.
2300200	2301200	Okay.
2301200	2302200	Okay.
2302200	2303200	Okay.
2303200	2304200	The show is a platform.
2304200	2305200	That's-
2305200	2306200	That's-
2306200	2307200	I'm just-
2307200	2308200	I'm doing a couple-
2308200	2309200	Two tiers.
2309200	2310200	You got to get that in there.
2310200	2311200	What-
2311200	2312200	Two, two, two.
2312200	2313200	It's-
2313200	2314200	Two tiers of power.
2314200	2315200	Power, power.
2315200	2316200	That's great.
2316200	2317200	That's great.
2317200	2319200	It's getting a little into content, which we're trying to avoid, but I-
2319200	2320200	Okay.
2320200	2324920	Is there any content or is it just you talking about the platform?
2325920	2331320	Well, one of the things I wanted to do is I want to harness people's webcams.
2331320	2334200	And then they're basically- it's almost like a mirror.
2334200	2335440	They're the show.
2335440	2336440	That's the show.
2336440	2337440	Yeah.
2337440	2338440	You see your own life.
2338440	2339440	Right.
2339440	2342200	But you don't- but it's not flipped like a mirror.
2342200	2345520	And that's the key difference.
2345520	2346520	It's how people see you.
2346520	2347520	Oh, and they're ads.
2347520	2348520	They're ads.
2348520	2349520	Oh.
2349520	2350520	Yeah.
2350520	2351520	That's two-
2351520	2352520	Two differences.
2352520	2353520	Two differences.
2353520	2354520	The second tier is that you get to watch yourself and there's ads.
2355120	2357840	It's like you're going to love it.
2357840	2361720	And you're the first streaming platform that's not content based.
2361720	2362720	No content.
2362720	2363720	No content.
2363720	2364720	No.
2364720	2367080	I think people are burnt down on content.
2367080	2371280	It's time that your own self is enough.
2371280	2376480	Well, I think it is, although we are in a deal with Schitt's Creek, we'll be honest,
2376480	2379520	we're trying to go downstream of that a little bit.
2379520	2383040	And then we have something called Head Up Your Asses.
2383040	2384040	The Urass Family.
2384040	2385040	Oh, the Urass Family.
2385040	2386040	You can say it on TV.
2386040	2388760	You can say it on TV because it's their name.
2388760	2389760	That's crazy.
2389760	2394240	I mean, honestly, when I was watching the Emmys, I was like, Schitt's Creek.
2394240	2395240	Like, oh my God.
2395240	2397720	You can say Schitt's Creek on the Emmys.
2397720	2398720	That's fantastic.
2398720	2400360	It is a hilarious show, by the way.
2400360	2402320	I don't mean to be- It's a dog.
2402320	2403320	It's a dog.
2403320	2404320	It's- it's-
2404320	2405320	Wait.
2405320	2406320	What?
2406320	2409200	Well, it's a dog.
2409880	2411200	I'm going to miss this show.
2411200	2412200	Yeah.
2412200	2415480	No, I'm not.
2415480	2418960	But our idea was- It's multidimensional.
2418960	2421120	We were going to do- we were going to team up.
2421120	2422120	We're still going to do it.
2422120	2423560	I have a way to do it.
2423560	2425000	You sure you want to tell them?
2425000	2426840	But your way to do it is your joke platform.
2426840	2428440	No, that's not a way- that's not the way to do it.
2428440	2431080	It would not be good for Media Master Plus.
2431080	2432080	Right.
2432080	2433640	It's not an M and Plus.
2433640	2434840	We wouldn't run it on that.
2434840	2435840	Okay.
2435840	2436840	It's not an M and Plus.
2436840	2438080	But I don't want to do it on Netflix because I want back-
2438080	2439640	No, I wouldn't be on Netflix.
2439640	2440640	Okay.
2440640	2441640	Yeah.
2441640	2442640	I know.
2442640	2443640	Back End.
2443640	2444640	What, like CBS All Access?
2444640	2445640	Back End would be nice.
2445640	2446640	NBC Purview?
2446640	2448640	Is CBS- CBS is all access?
2448640	2451760	Like there's no one they say no to?
2451760	2455440	There's not like some institutional racism or something where it's like, no, you're Korean.
2455440	2457000	You can't get this channel.
2457000	2458000	It's all access.
2458000	2459000	Yeah.
2459000	2460000	I think that's-
2460000	2462000	They still hate Koreans on that.
2462000	2463000	They do.
2463000	2465960	It's like CBS, but everyone's allowed to watch.
2465960	2466960	That's great.
2466960	2468760	Everyone's so big at them.
2468760	2469760	Yeah.
2469760	2470760	CBS All Access.
2470760	2472920	CBS, everybody can watch.
2472920	2475120	Maybe that'll work.
2475120	2478960	Maybe that'll- are you- do you have a deal there?
2478960	2480080	Are you exclusive there?
2480080	2483280	I'm working with your buddy Ron on a thing for CBS All Access.
2483280	2484280	Yeah.
2484280	2485280	Ron Howard.
2485280	2486280	Ron Howard.
2486280	2487280	Very, very nice.
2487280	2488280	You always have to go, I'm working at CBS.
2488280	2490760	And then you pause and then you go, All Access.
2490760	2496680	And people are so relieved, they're like, oh my God, finally bisexuals can watch CBS.
2497400	2498400	You know what I mean?
2498400	2501440	It's not like you don't have to pass any fucking test.
2501440	2502600	Like anybody's welcome.
2502600	2503600	I do.
2503600	2509440	I will say CBS being like, I think that they're playing at the smartest because I was part
2509440	2515800	of CISO, which was NBC's half-hearted attempt to like, they're like, oh, we see where this
2515800	2516800	is going.
2516800	2518200	The world's going to be mini Netflixes.
2518200	2522880	And so they put a little bit of money into this thing, CISO, and we created Harmon Quest
2522880	2527120	for them, and a lot of great shows were created for them under the.
2527120	2529960	You took all of CISO's money as I heard it.
2529960	2530960	That was the word that got passed.
2530960	2531960	We took all of it.
2531960	2532960	It was like, no, Dan has all their money.
2532960	2533960	They ran out.
2533960	2534960	They ran out of money.
2534960	2535960	We rolled a 20.
2535960	2540480	But I think CBS is being the smartest about it because they're basically like, here's
2540480	2544480	our platform on the web, CBS All Access.
2544480	2549400	All Access is simultaneously like unignorable, but it's also like, just sort of like, it's
2549400	2551120	just, it means nothing.
2551120	2555600	So I think they sat there and went like, well, what are we going to do?
2555600	2558880	Eventually the thing with the antennas, no one's going to watch it anywhere, right?
2558880	2562640	And they're like, so we can't call this thing Snapcrackle Dippledapple, like we can't like
2562640	2565600	go all in on that and have it compete with like the world world.
2565600	2572120	It's just like, just call it CBS with a ramp, call it CBS All Aboard.
2572120	2576840	And then it's like, everyone gets a board and it's like, CBS, psych, burp, it's like,
2576840	2577840	welcome to CBS.
2577840	2578840	Oh, I'm just kidding.
2578840	2579840	We're Netflix.
2580560	2581560	That's right.
2581560	2582720	It's like, hey, we don't want any trouble.
2582720	2584280	We're just CBS All Access.
2584280	2585280	Yeah.
2585280	2586280	Like there's nothing.
2586280	2588560	It's that CBS Platinum plus Shadowmaster.
2588560	2591920	But also the CBS television, they produce for everybody.
2591920	2592920	So you could go.
2592920	2593920	Exactly.
2593920	2597040	What is the Hurwitz-Harmon project you guys talking about?
2597040	2598040	It wouldn't be for you.
2598040	2599040	I don't think you would appreciate it.
2599040	2600040	You're outside the demo.
2600040	2601040	You're outside the demo.
2601040	2602040	This is for a millennial thing.
2602040	2603040	It's like, if you're a millennial.
2603040	2604040	It's for millennials like us.
2604040	2607040	Give me the elevator pitch on you guys.
2607760	2608760	Well, why don't we just sing with it?
2608760	2610040	Because it's all abbreviations.
2610040	2611040	It's all just initials.
2611040	2612040	It's all millennials.
2612040	2613040	It's all millennials.
2613040	2614040	You have an opening theme song.
2614040	2615040	We have a theme song.
2615040	2617040	Why don't we just sing the theme song?
2617040	2618040	I feel like it gives away too much.
2618040	2619040	I think you'll get the idea.
2619040	2622040	It's like, remember the Beverly Hillbillies, like the whole conceit, but you're okay.
2622040	2623040	Yeah.
2623040	2624040	It was like you would watch the movie.
2624040	2625040	Totally.
2625040	2626040	You'd go like, okay, that's enough.
2626040	2627040	I've had enough story.
2627040	2628040	Yeah.
2628040	2648920	Two garbage men found a genie who worked in sanitation as well as the garbage men.
2648920	2656120	But the garbage genie had thrown away half of its wishes.
2656120	2662440	But the two garbage men didn't care because they were happy delivering garbage.
2662440	2677080	So now the three of them are a family delivering wishes that other people throw away.
2677080	2688880	And the genie is dying a painful death that Western medicine can't treat yet.
2688880	2691800	So it's got some heart too.
2691800	2702200	But one of the garbage men is withholding his final wish, which he could use to cure
2702200	2710440	the genie, but he wants to fuck her.
2710440	2711440	That's why.
2711440	2712440	That's why.
2712440	2713440	That's why.
2713440	2721880	They're family, family, delivering garbage and wishes.
2721880	2727120	Misunderstanding the very concept of what garbage men do.
2727120	2735640	They don't deliver garbage hashtag rape culture.
2735640	2737280	That's not the title.
2737280	2738280	Millennials only.
2738280	2739280	Millennials only is the title.
2739280	2740280	Yeah.
2740280	2741280	Yeah.
2741280	2742280	Partial access.
2742280	2745160	It's on CBS partial access.
2745160	2746160	Partial access.
2746160	2747160	Yeah.
2747160	2751400	CBS is racially motivated, let a little known racial, partial access.
2751400	2755640	It's actually just for, um, it's on CBS, no audio.
2756640	2760320	And it's, a lot of people are like, oh, is it, it's racially it's, but it's, it's like
2760320	2761320	moonraker.
2761320	2765360	It's like the, the, the only people that can watch CBS partial access, it's like it's selecting
2765360	2767720	people from each racial group on earth.
2767720	2768720	Their logo.
2768720	2769720	That's what happens in moonraker.
2769720	2770720	I forgot.
2770720	2771720	I don't remember that from moonraker.
2771720	2776360	It's like a super colony of people, you know, they're like, you want, you want like, there's
2776360	2781720	like three people of, of every, uh, part of, of earth life that you're going to, they're
2781720	2784280	going to, CBS is going to start a super colony with.
2784280	2788960	You know, we, um, if we were a, we're going to be gene splicing at some point and we will
2788960	2790080	be able to do that.
2790080	2795800	We will be able to decide what qualities we should have are, and you can imagine how badly
2795800	2796800	this will go.
2796800	2801120	Well, people will be able to say to parents, cause you know, it's like the GI bill and student
2801120	2802120	loans and things.
2802120	2804720	It's going to go in a direction where people go like, so you want to have a kid, which
2804720	2809640	by the way, shame on you, like we'll, we'll be, we'll be trained to be like, Oh, I'm such
2809640	2812240	a horrible person at this time in day.
2812240	2816360	Like I want to have a kid and it'll be like, like, uh, yeah, I want an SUV and the doctoral
2816360	2819000	sit you down and go, so here's the different packages.
2819000	2825800	This one, if you agree that your kid will be super into anime for seven years, um, the
2825800	2833120	Japanese government is willing to give you $10,000 for diapers, which is a pretty, pretty
2833120	2834120	big carrot.
2834120	2838720	If your kid has an affinity for Apple products or is willing to work in the stock room, like,
2838720	2841240	for five years, everything will be a broke.
2841240	2844680	Their life will be broken into like, like trade off.
2844680	2845680	Yeah.
2845680	2850440	I think, well, I also think that if we'd gotten this a while ago, like the, the mistakes we
2850440	2853120	would have made, we would have probably gotten rid of fear.
2853120	2854120	Right?
2854120	2857380	I mean, I think about what, like what people's biggest problems are usually fear-based.
2857380	2858640	So we would have gotten rid of that.
2858640	2859640	We'd all be dead.
2859640	2860640	Yeah.
2860640	2861920	That's what you need right now.
2861920	2862920	More fearless people.
2862920	2863920	Yeah.
2863920	2866160	Let's see what we can do about that shame too.
2866160	2868080	Let's dial that shame down a little bit.
2868080	2871760	Did I encounter too many shameful people on the internet nowadays?
2871760	2874400	You know, I post a picture of my fiance.
2874400	2880280	Why is the 15 year old that leaves a comment have to be so shame driven?
2880280	2881280	Come on kid.
2881280	2885000	Don't be afraid to say whatever the fuck you want to an adult that could beat the piss
2885000	2886960	out of you.
2886960	2887960	Go ahead.
2887960	2888960	Let it rip.
2888960	2896400	After all, your username is a string of fucking dollar signs and a missile emoji.
2896400	2898840	You're too shameful.
2898840	2905120	You like Nazis, Robbie?
2905120	2906520	Robbie and the Nazis.
2906520	2908840	Oh, look who's back.
2908840	2911600	Colonel, glad you could join us.
2911600	2913160	Speaking of Nazis.
2913160	2914160	Fucking cold up here.
2914160	2916800	Do you know how freezing it is?
2916800	2918920	Did you just take a bath?
2918920	2919920	What did you do?
2919920	2920920	Were you?
2920920	2923480	Oh, I took a pee and then I sat down and I thought of it.
2923480	2924480	We can do that?
2925000	2926000	We can just pee?
2926000	2927000	Yeah.
2927000	2931280	The show's done.
2931280	2932280	Nothing matters anymore.
2932280	2933280	Wow.
2933280	2934280	Nothing matters.
2934280	2938680	Rob, weren't you going to do like kind of a soulful solo song about how nothing matters
2938680	2939680	anymore?
2939680	2940680	Sure.
2940680	2941680	He doesn't care.
2941680	2942680	Doesn't matter.
2942680	2943680	Hmm.
2943680	2968840	Nothing matters when I go take a pee.
2968840	2975120	I don't even flush.
2975120	2992360	When I'm finished, I let it mellow and smells like spinach because I ate some yesterday.
2992360	2996360	Nothing matters.
2997360	3002360	My pee smells like spinach.
3002360	3003360	You like it?
3003360	3004360	Nothing matters.
3004360	3007360	I don't.
3007360	3015360	I hold my nose when I urinate.
3015360	3020360	Yes.
3020360	3022360	That's where it pays off to have them.
3022360	3024360	Thank you.
3024360	3025360	That's what we've been waiting for.
3026360	3035360	I came back on stage because I needed some help and luckily that was completely off mic
3035360	3038360	and the paying customers won't hear it.
3038360	3045360	Robbie, we did a gig in New York together with Dino and Stephen Colbert and Louis C.K.
3045360	3050360	and Tina Fey and a bunch of people's and everybody was freaked out that you were there because
3051360	3055360	I was even more uncomfortable on that stage than I am on this one.
3055360	3063360	But Tina before the show, I met Tina once but I never met Stephen Colbert and they're
3063360	3068360	like Robbie Fox is going to be here and they were nervous about being on a stage with you.
3068360	3070360	I don't think that's true what you're saying.
3070360	3076360	No, it is true because I heard them say that and Tina said that she used to get guitar
3077360	3082360	lessons from you back in the Chicago Second City days and they all took lessons from you
3082360	3086360	because it was like getting a free Robbie Fox concert.
3086360	3090360	They didn't want to learn.
3090360	3092360	Does that piss you off?
3092360	3094360	It was frustrating, yes.
3094360	3096360	I would have charged more.
3096360	3099360	Tina sniffs out a deal.
3099360	3103360	She knows a deal when she sees it.
3103360	3106360	What was the song you and Tina sang?
3106360	3109360	Was it like a Johnny and June song?
3109360	3111360	I'm trying to remember.
3111360	3115360	I think it might have been Success by Loretta Lynn.
3115360	3117360	She can really sing.
3117360	3119360	She's a good singer, right?
3119360	3121360	You guys were fantastic together.
3121360	3125360	She told me before the show and I only met her briefly once and she was like I'm having a freakout
3125360	3129360	right now because I have to go up on stage and sing with Robbie Fox.
3130360	3132360	I don't know if this story is of interest or not.
3132360	3134360	She had a birthday party one time.
3134360	3136360	She was turning 40.
3136360	3141360	Her husband asked me, Jeff asked me to come play and it was a surprise for her.
3145360	3147360	So what's the story here?
3150360	3153360	One story is that I thought I didn't know what it would be like, right?
3153360	3158360	It's in a rock club and I didn't know would it be like her parents or would it be comedians
3158360	3160360	or what would it be?
3160360	3162360	It's just Rob Schneider sitting in a rocking suit.
3162360	3163360	Right.
3163360	3167360	Rob Schneider was there and Melanie Hutsell.
3167360	3169360	They were all there.
3169360	3172360	That's a joke for three people.
3172360	3175360	I know it's like an office party, basically.
3175360	3179360	A 30-rock office, like the cast and the producers and stuff were there.
3179360	3183360	There were like 40 people there, you know, in a club that holds 600 people.
3183360	3189360	And they were milling around and Tina sat on a couch kind of in the middle and watched me play.
3189360	3192360	And everybody else ignored me.
3192360	3197360	And I was with like a seven-piece band making a lot of noise and I prepared some special material.
3197360	3201360	And I think this is mildly interesting.
3201360	3208360	I've never told this story before, but I thought I was preparing this stuff and I thought it was too complimentary of Tina.
3208360	3217360	I wrote a song about Tina and about our old days in Chicago and this and that and was feeling really kind of corny and positive.
3217360	3221360	And I'm two minutes into this song and I thought, well, I'll do a joke in here.
3221360	3228360	So the song was Tina, whoa, whoa, whoa, Tina.
3228360	3232360	Anyway, I put in a line about Tina, you're faultless in my book.
3232360	3236360	Then I go, date night, I'll overlook like that.
3236360	3242360	Date Night was a terrible movie that she was in just to explain that.
3242360	3250360	And so I got to this joke and like the crowd was kind of like enjoying it up to that point, like it was about Tina and it was positive.
3250360	3261360	And then it just turned the whole mood of the room really turned on because they probably all worked on the film.
3261360	3264360	It was a total miscalculation.
3264360	3270360	And I even apologized to her afterwards because I thought I'd kind of ruined a moment.
3270360	3275360	And she said, oh, no, that's she said, I expected you to insult me because it's you.
3275360	3278360	She said, they're just all scared of me.
3278360	3281360	She said, she's kind of intense.
3281360	3293360	Like my brief encounters with her, like she really is like, like to meet her is to have been met pretty hard.
3293360	3296360	That's great.
3296360	3299360	But she told me, she was, you're Jeff.
3299360	3301360	You.
3301360	3304360	You're funny motherfucker.
3304360	3306360	She turned around and walked away.
3306360	3308360	That was that's meeting Tina for me.
3308360	3312360	She just like she just nails you and fucking bones out.
3312360	3318360	You didn't even get a chance to just kick her in the balls over the date night thing.
3318360	3322360	That sounds amazing.
3323360	3328360	I would think is it is it must be harder?
3328360	3329360	Well, maybe it's not.
3329360	3332360	But is it harder to play for a small audience than a large audience?
3332360	3333360	Audience of one.
3333360	3335360	I mean, an audience of one, too.
3335360	3337360	Yeah, it's kind of daunting.
3337360	3339360	I don't know what it's like to play for a large audience.
3339360	3342360	Maybe.
3342360	3348360	The first time I saw you, I was in Chicago and I asked Dino, what's what's something cool to do in Chicago?
3348360	3349360	And he goes, you should go.
3349360	3351360	Is it the hideout or the hideaway?
3351360	3352360	The hideout.
3352360	3354360	The hideout, which is what's what part of town in Chicago is that?
3354360	3356360	It doesn't really have a name, but it's on the near north side.
3356360	3358360	It's like Bucktown or.
3358360	3359360	No, it doesn't even have a name.
3359360	3361360	OK, it's just it's by.
3361360	3364360	Is it Jamestown?
3364360	3365360	Free more guesses.
3365360	3368360	Loho.
3368360	3369360	All I know is it.
3369360	3370360	Castle Rock.
3370360	3375360	It was by a rubbish tip and some debris.
3375360	3376360	That is correct.
3376360	3377360	Yeah.
3377360	3382360	And I went in there and saw the show and I texted my brother, Bill, and I was like, dude, like you would fucking freak out right now.
3382360	3384360	There's this guy named Robbie Fox playing.
3384360	3387360	He's playing like bluegrass country, folky stuff.
3387360	3392360	And I texted my brother and he takes it back and he goes, I have every one of his records.
3392360	3395360	And I put you, I met you after the show.
3395360	3396360	I said, I know Dino San Metopoulos.
3396360	3401360	My brother is on the phone right now and you got in the phone and you insulted me to my brother.
3401360	3404360	You said, I like you more than your brother.
3404360	3406360	Your brother's a piece of shit.
3406360	3408360	I said you were terrible on date night.
3408360	3410360	I remember.
3410360	3413360	You got one go to.
3413360	3415360	The date night event.
3415360	3418360	He thinks everybody was on date night.
3418360	3421360	Would you be honest with us if your name was fake?
3421360	3424360	Because it seems like such a richly musician name.
3424360	3430360	Robbie Folks, like I would be like if somebody said, hey, the handyman's coming over to fix the sink.
3430360	3431360	His name is Robbie Folks.
3431360	3433360	I'd be like, well, what the hell is he fixing my sink for?
3433360	3436360	Give that guy a guitar.
3436360	3437360	Really?
3437360	3440360	I've never encountered that point of view, but.
3440360	3443360	It doesn't seem like a musician's name to you?
3443360	3444360	Well, it wouldn't do you.
3444360	3446360	I guess if it's your real name is what you're telling me.
3446360	3447360	It's my real name.
3447360	3450360	Yeah, I wouldn't have chosen it to be a country singer.
3450360	3451360	I don't know what.
3451360	3454360	Did your mom not like Robert?
3454360	3456360	So Rob's name is also Robbie.
3456360	3459360	That was my dad and yes, you're right.
3459360	3461360	Is it Robbie on your birth certificate?
3461360	3462360	Robbie?
3462360	3463360	Oh, it's Robert.
3463360	3467360	Robbie on his birth certificate.
3467360	3470360	How does that feel?
3470360	3471360	Robbie Schrab.
3471360	3472360	Robbie.
3472360	3473360	Tell him why.
3473360	3474360	Tell him why.
3474360	3479360	Because my mom, when she was pregnant, there were a lot of restaurants being made.
3479360	3481360	And she thought.
3481360	3483360	Because his mom's a Flintstone.
3483360	3485360	Yeah.
3485360	3489360	This is back at the Wisconsin restaurant boom.
3489360	3491360	The outdoors were becoming in.
3491360	3498360	And she said, you know, well, one day my son might grow up and he'll own a restaurant.
3498360	3500360	Not be a hunter gatherer like we are.
3500360	3501360	Yeah.
3501360	3505360	He can own a restaurant and he could call it Robbie's restaurant.
3505360	3508360	Like I couldn't do that if my name was Timothy.
3508360	3509360	Right.
3509360	3512360	It would be like, if everyone was still foraging, she would have named you Frank.
3512360	3513360	Yeah.
3513360	3515360	Nobody would eat at Robert's.
3515360	3517360	Robert's restaurant.
3518360	3520360	And no one named Robert has ever gone by Robbie.
3520360	3523360	So it was really good thinking.
3523360	3526360	When did you leave the South, Robbie?
3526360	3527360	Not you, Robbie.
3527360	3528360	Robbie folks.
3528360	3529360	Roberts.
3529360	3531360	I left it when I was 17, Jeff.
3531360	3532360	Yeah.
3532360	3533360	Yeah.
3533360	3535360	And do you have any connections back there still?
3535360	3536360	Oh, yeah.
3536360	3539360	Like high school friends that have grown old and hideous looking.
3539360	3540360	Not a lot of people.
3540360	3542360	Family's all gone now.
3542360	3544360	Yeah, nobody there.
3544360	3546360	My folks moved to Mexico and yeah, everybody's gone.
3547360	3550360	I'm not pimping out to sing this, but there's a song if you want to listen to
3550360	3551360	it.
3551360	3552360	It's called That's Where I'm From.
3552360	3554360	It's one of my favorite songs by Robbie.
3554360	3558360	It's a beautiful song about like you're not country, but you are country
3558360	3560360	because you came from country.
3560360	3561360	Yeah.
3561360	3564360	Me and my wife, we moved to the suburbs and we got this house that we almost
3564360	3565360	sort of couldn't afford.
3565360	3568360	And I thought it was a fancy neighborhood for people like us.
3568360	3571360	And then I found out that like all those people came from, you know,
3571360	3574360	Cribdeath, Iowa or somewhere like that, you know, way out.
3574360	3575360	Cribdeath.
3575360	3579360	The name of the town is Cribdeath.
3581360	3582360	Is that why?
3582360	3583360	Because I thought this was so unusual.
3583360	3584360	I've heard that song.
3584360	3586360	It has that bridge by Vincent Price.
3586360	3587360	Yes.
3587360	3588360	That's just him talking.
3588360	3589360	Can we hear it?
3589360	3590360	Can we hear it?
3590360	3591360	Can we hear it?
3591360	3592360	Yeah, yeah.
3592360	3593360	Can we hear it?
3593360	3594360	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3594360	3595360	Can we hear it?
3595360	3596360	Can we hear it?
3596360	3597360	Yeah, yeah.
3597360	3598360	Can we hear it?
3598360	3599360	Yeah, yeah.
3599360	3600360	Can we hear it?
3600360	3601360	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3601360	3602360	Can we hear it?
3602360	3603360	Yeah, yeah.
3603360	3604360	If we can hear it, can we hear it?
3604360	3605360	Yeah.
3605360	3606360	Can we do Vincent Price?
3606360	3607360	Let me hear it.
3607360	3608360	Wait.
3608360	3609360	No, no, no, no, do that's where I'm from.
3609360	3611360	Here, he's just playing guitar.
3611360	3612360	Well, yeah.
3612360	3613360	The tingler is loose in the theater.
3613360	3615360	Whoa, he can do it to practice.
3615360	3616360	The tingler.
3616360	3618360	Is that three for your life?
3618360	3620360	He's out there tingling.
3620360	3621360	Who's singing?
3621360	3622360	Dan.
3622360	3625360	I thought you were going to play a little bit of that's where I'm from.
3625360	3627360	Jeff requested this actual song.
3627360	3628360	Sorry.
3628360	3629360	I didn't mean to, and I was just throwing in.
3629360	3632360	I was like, oh, it isn't the bridge by Vincent Price, which I guess is me saying
3632360	3634440	like, oh yeah, play that thing that's really valuable to you
3634440	3636440	and mean something to you and I'll fuck it up in the middle.
3636440	3638440	That's why I'm here.
3638440	3640440	With my famous Vincent Price impression.
3640440	3642440	If you're going to sing it Robbie,
3642440	3645440	then Dan, give him the boom mic so he can sing into it,
3645440	3647440	and I'd have to hold the thing.
3647440	3649440	I want to hear the Vincent Price impression.
3649440	3651440	It's too much of me on this show.
3651440	3652440	Oh no.
3652440	3654440	How about if Vincent Price introduces you
3654440	3656440	and then you do the songs.
3656440	3657440	That's how you do it.
3657440	3658440	And that's what he would do.
3658440	3660440	That's how you do it.
3660520	3663520	I'm glad we took the time to figure this out
3663520	3664520	because that's how you do it.
3664520	3665520	That's how you do it.
3665520	3666520	Vincent Price is hosting SNL.
3666520	3667520	Yeah.
3667520	3671520	Ladies and gentlemen, Robbie Fox is spooky.
3671520	3673520	Whoa.
3673520	3675520	Shh.
3675520	3678520	Give him the mic so he can sing.
3678520	3682520	This live television is intense.
3682520	3685520	So I'm doing this Moblin song that you...
3685520	3687520	You don't have to do that one.
3687520	3688520	I love this one.
3688600	3690600	You don't have to do the song.
3690600	3693600	But I adore the song so if you don't mind.
3693600	3695600	What did Levy do with the...
3695600	3696600	What are you doing?
3696600	3699600	Looking for his fucking life.
3699600	3701600	Robbie, this is Dino's choice.
3701600	3703600	If you want to sing that one or something else,
3703600	3704600	do you want to do another song?
3704600	3705600	Well, you kind of set it up.
3705600	3706600	Yeah.
3706600	3707600	You really did.
3707600	3708600	It's kind of Moblin.
3708600	3710600	Should we do the Vincent Price introduction again?
3710600	3711600	Yeah, please.
3711600	3713600	Okay, so Vincent Price introduces it.
3713600	3714600	Robbie sings a couple of verses.
3714600	3716600	There might be a...
3716680	3719680	Like bridge, kind of hook.
3719680	3720680	There's Levy with him.
3720680	3723680	Steve Levy, we love and appreciate you.
3723680	3725680	Love and appreciate Steve Levy.
3725680	3726680	We appreciate...
3726680	3728680	Don't make it unconditional.
3728680	3732680	We appreciate you, Steve Levy.
3732680	3734680	Ladies and gentlemen,
3734680	3738680	when I was on tour with the spiders...
3743680	3745680	We did so much fucking coke.
3747600	3751600	That a thousand ghosts reaped my soul.
3751600	3754600	But this next musician...
3754600	3756600	My heart's not in it.
3756600	3758600	His heart wasn't in it.
3758600	3760600	His heart wasn't in it, yeah.
3760600	3763600	Anyways...
3763600	3767600	The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo
3767600	3771600	presents Robbie Folks playing...
3771600	3773600	What's the name of the song again?
3773600	3774600	That's where I'm...
3774600	3775600	Ghost.
3775600	3778600	Oh, sorry, no. That's where I'm from.
3781600	3783600	Back in the driveway,
3783600	3785600	the end of the work day,
3785600	3790600	and how fast that world disappears...
3790600	3792600	Like a ghost.
3792600	3796600	A fresh lawn, a pine tree.
3796600	3798600	I don't know if I want to do this.
3798600	3801600	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3801600	3802600	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
3802600	3804600	I'm sorry. Start over if you want to.
3804600	3806600	This is what you do. This is what you do.
3806600	3807600	I'm not gonna keep doing it.
3807600	3809600	This is his...
3809600	3811600	This is his favorite song,
3811600	3813600	and you're taking a shit all over.
3813600	3818600	A man climbs as high as he can,
3818600	3825600	but his heart belongs where it began.
3826600	3830600	I can see in my mind's eye
3830600	3833600	a shack on a hillside
3833600	3838600	and a mean billy goat on a chain.
3839600	3842600	And Dad, due in battle
3842600	3847600	with dirt hard as gravel and summers,
3847600	3851600	the crops never came.
3851600	3857600	We'd shoot down a pheasant in flight
3857600	3862600	and sing songs about Jesus all night.
3862600	3866600	And that's where I'm from,
3866600	3869600	where time passes slower.
3869600	3872600	That's where I'm from,
3872600	3876600	where it's just mamino, sir.
3876600	3879600	You can't tell I'm country,
3879600	3882600	just you look closer.
3882600	3885600	It's deep in my blood.
3885600	3894600	Two cars, a pitted fence,
3894600	3897600	that's where I've come.
3897600	3900600	Dirt roads and double whys,
3900600	3903600	that's where I'm from.
3915600	3924600	Night school on a fast track,
3924600	3927600	and no cause to look back,
3927600	3933600	that place put a scar on my soul.
3933600	3937600	And I swore my young ones
3937600	3940600	would never know hunger.
3940600	3947600	Now the good life is all they know.
3947600	3953600	Well, I've watched them grow, now I see.
3953600	3959600	One thing separates them from me,
3959600	3962600	and that's where I'm from,
3962600	3966600	where time passes slower.
3966600	3969600	That's where I'm from,
3969600	3973600	where it's just mamino, sir.
3973600	3976600	You can't tell I'm country,
3976600	3979600	just you look closer.
3979600	3983600	It's deep in my blood.
3988600	3993600	Two cars, a white collar, a necktie,
3993600	3996600	that's where I've come.
3996600	3999600	Half naked in the moonshine,
3999600	4003600	yeah, that's where I'm from.
4027600	4034600	If you've ever heard Hank Williams sing,
4034600	4039600	brother, you know the whole blessed thing,
4039600	4043600	because that's where I'm from,
4043600	4047600	where time passes slower.
4047600	4050600	That's where I'm from,
4050600	4053600	where it's just mamino, sir.
4053600	4057600	You can't tell I'm country,
4057600	4060600	just you look closer.
4060600	4065600	Well, it's deep in my blood.
4069600	4072600	A long way down a hard road,
4072600	4076600	that's where I've come.
4076600	4080600	Someplace I can't go home to,
4080600	4084600	that's where I'm from.
4084600	4100600	Mmmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
4100600	4121600	I want to take guitar lessons from you.
4121600	4122600	I'm ready.
4122600	4123600	I'm ready.
4123600	4124600	That was beautiful.
4124600	4125600	That was beautiful.
4125600	4128100	You said you're kind of self-taught, too?
4128100	4133100	You started playing by yourself, or do you take lessons as well?
4133100	4137100	Well, my dad showed me chords and stuff, and my mom, too.
4137100	4139100	Yeah, just records after that.
4139100	4140100	Whoa.
4140100	4142100	Who do you listen to?
4142100	4148100	Oh, the people that I like when I was young.
4148100	4152100	I think a lot of them really, I still like them, a lot of them, is what I'm trying to say.
4152100	4155100	And that's like Doc Watson and John Hartford.
4155100	4159100	And then later on, when I broke from my parents' taste a little bit,
4159100	4162100	you know, the Beatles and obvious stuff like that, I guess.
4162100	4164100	I don't know that.
4164100	4166100	I know Doc Watson, obviously.
4166100	4167100	Yes.
4167100	4168100	Doc Watson, obviously.
4168100	4169100	What was the last thing?
4169100	4170100	I mean, the joy.
4170100	4175100	What's on the Beatles, yeah.
4175100	4181100	Where are you at now, creatively and or, and answer it any way you want?
4181100	4185100	In your life now, I don't know what your path has been from youth to,
4185100	4188100	and how you've gauged that with your relationship with other people,
4188100	4190100	hearing your music and things.
4190100	4193100	Where are we finding you right now?
4193100	4203100	Are you pursuing your own bliss at the expense of pleasing other people,
4203100	4205100	or is it the opposite?
4205100	4206100	I don't know.
4206100	4208100	It's a bad question, I guess.
4208100	4210100	I'm just always curious with musicians.
4210100	4214100	You're clearly a very authentic, confident guy,
4214100	4218100	and I'm wondering, have you been on this journey of,
4218100	4221100	what's your relationship with what you do?
4221100	4227100	Do you go home at night and putter in a dark room and play things
4227100	4231100	into a little hard drive and only listen to them yourself
4231100	4234100	and then cut your forearm a little bit?
4234100	4237100	Or would you like another Grammy?
4237100	4241100	Or are you like, is there a British guy that comes over and goes,
4241100	4244100	Robbie, Robbie, baby, what are you doing, baby?
4244100	4245100	We need another hit.
4245100	4246100	It's got to have a hook.
4246100	4247100	Come on.
4247100	4248100	It's got to have a hook, love.
4248100	4249100	Come on, Bullocks.
4249100	4250100	Go for that.
4250100	4252100	I mean, I love where you're from and all that business.
4252100	4253100	Jesus Christ.
4253100	4258100	Give him another fucking syringe for the fucking old timey country shit.
4258100	4260100	Come on, baby, comfortably numb.
4260100	4261100	Get up.
4261100	4262100	We've got a tour to do.
4262100	4263100	Blimey.
4263100	4269100	That's a great question, Dan.
4269100	4271100	See, I'm not a bad interviewer.
4271100	4272100	People say I'm a bad interviewer.
4272100	4275100	People say you're a bad interviewer, but that was a perfect question.
4275100	4278100	I think that was like, I'm like Charlie Rose, but well,
4278100	4280100	I was going to say without the sexual harassment.
4280100	4281100	I'm like Charlie Rose.
4281100	4282100	You're like Charlie Rose.
4282100	4283100	Yeah, you're just like Charlie Rose.
4283100	4290100	You're exactly Charlie Rose.
4290100	4298100	I'm going to say yes or no question.
4298100	4301100	You moved out to L.A. with Donna, your wife,
4301100	4304100	because she's pursuing stuff out here too.
4304100	4305100	Yeah, I'm tagging along with her.
4305100	4307100	But you gig all the time.
4307100	4308100	You're on tour constantly.
4308100	4309100	Yeah, I'm out a lot.
4309100	4313100	And yeah, I haven't really found a slot to fit in here yet,
4313100	4315100	but we've only been here a few months.
4315100	4319100	What was the record that was the Grammy nominee?
4319100	4321100	Oh, it's Upland Stories.
4321100	4323100	It's about three years old, I guess.
4323100	4327100	And you also nominated for a track too, right?
4327100	4329100	Oh yeah, the track was called Alabama at Night.
4329100	4330100	Yeah, I would say he could win it.
4330100	4331100	I didn't win it yet.
4331100	4332100	I lost.
4332100	4334100	I lost two Grammys.
4334100	4338100	I've technically lost every Grammy.
4338100	4339100	You win.
4339100	4342100	You were up against some cool stuff,
4342100	4347100	but just the fact that somebody found...
4348100	4349100	I'm a pretty small...
4349100	4350100	I have a real small audience,
4350100	4352100	so it was just cool to be included in that, yeah.
4352100	4353100	Yeah.
4353100	4354100	Amazing.
4354100	4355100	I've seen you play...
4355100	4358100	When you come to L.A., back in Chicago,
4358100	4362100	you play McCabe's, which is an awesome music store in...
4362100	4363100	Santa Monica.
4363100	4365100	Santa Monica.
4365100	4368100	And you're funnier than all the comics that I know,
4368100	4369100	and the music...
4369100	4372100	And you also just pick people that play...
4372100	4374100	I saw you play the Troubadour.
4374100	4376100	What was that gig that you played at the Troubadour?
4376100	4377100	Brother and I came.
4377100	4381100	But the headliner was some young teeny-bopper band,
4381100	4383100	and I texted you afterwards,
4383100	4386100	and I was like, those people couldn't follow you
4386100	4390100	because you and a bunch of kind of old dudes
4390100	4393100	playing bluegrass killed it,
4393100	4394100	and you texted me back,
4394100	4396100	follow that, motherfuckers,
4396100	4398100	because they couldn't fucking follow it.
4398100	4401100	Because you pick local musicians and stuff,
4401100	4403100	and everybody just fucking rocks.
4403100	4405100	So this ends in December, this podcast?
4405100	4406100	Yeah.
4406100	4409100	So, could we have a podcast where you just compliment me?
4409100	4410100	Yes.
4410100	4411100	That'd be the whole podcast.
4411100	4412100	That's our new...
4412100	4413100	What is that?
4413100	4414100	Here's a more refined question.
4414100	4415100	Yeah.
4415100	4417100	I want to know...
4417100	4418100	Everybody...
4418100	4419100	You want to use the restroom.
4419100	4421100	Yeah, because the exits are too...
4421100	4424100	This is something that I'm curious about with musicians in general,
4424100	4426100	and I'm sure all their answers are different,
4426100	4427100	but I'm just...
4427100	4429100	Because at the end of the pipeline,
4429100	4430100	we hear songs.
4430100	4432100	They're two minutes, three minutes, four minutes.
4432100	4433100	They have...
4433100	4434100	Five minutes.
4434100	4435100	All right.
4435100	4436100	Six minutes.
4436100	4437100	Seven minutes.
4437100	4438100	Eight minutes.
4438100	4439100	Eight minutes.
4439100	4440100	Eight minutes.
4440100	4441100	God damn it.
4441100	4442100	Nine minutes.
4442100	4449100	I'm curious about the process of the relationship with what the end product is.
4449100	4452100	Does a musician or you yourself...
4452100	4453100	What do you...
4453100	4454100	Is it like...
4454100	4455100	Ah, God.
4455100	4456100	Just ask a question.
4456100	4458100	Ask him a question.
4458100	4461100	I think what Dan is asking...
4461100	4462100	No, I think...
4462100	4463100	What it...
4463100	4465100	I will say, like, my friend Jim Vallee always says,
4465100	4467100	talent is the thing you can't do.
4467100	4470100	And so, like, I'm speaking for Dan here, but, like, for me, like,
4470100	4471100	I listen to that.
4471100	4472100	I just...
4472100	4473100	It boggles my mind.
4473100	4474100	I don't know how you could do it.
4474100	4475100	I don't know how you could write it.
4475100	4478100	That's why I wonder, like, how do you define, like,
4478100	4480100	when something becomes a song?
4480100	4481100	Like, do you...
4481100	4482100	Do you...
4482100	4483100	Do you go...
4483100	4486100	Are you, like, sitting in bed and you're watching Succession on HBO?
4486100	4487100	And then you're like,
4487100	4488100	Fuck!
4488100	4489100	I got a song in my...
4489100	4490100	I got to go down.
4490100	4494100	Oh, you only got two hours left to finish this song.
4494100	4496100	Jeff's acting like if I stop asking the question,
4496100	4498100	you're going to have just a fountain of information.
4498100	4500100	Ask him a question.
4500100	4504100	Yeah, I'm working on it, man.
4504100	4505100	Here's my question.
4505100	4506100	I got a question for you.
4506100	4507100	Because it's so...
4507100	4509100	Your work has got to be so self-motivated, you know?
4509100	4513100	And, like, I've sort of even chosen TV because you have...
4513100	4514100	Wait.
4514100	4518100	Is that Modern Dance?
4518100	4519100	Oh, shit.
4519100	4521100	Dan's having a heart attack.
4521100	4523100	What is he doing?
4523100	4528100	What is going on?
4528100	4529100	He's having a stroke.
4529100	4531100	What the fucking...
4531100	4532100	No, I think I know...
4532100	4533100	I think I know what Dan is asking.
4533100	4536100	I can't believe...
4542100	4543100	But...
4543100	4546100	So I've chosen a field where there's always a gun to my head.
4547100	4548100	And do you just...
4548100	4549100	You don't have that.
4549100	4551100	Answer the question, Robbie.
4551100	4554100	How often do you write songs?
4554100	4555100	How often do you write songs?
4555100	4557100	How often do you write songs?
4557100	4558100	That's a question.
4558100	4560100	How often do you write songs, you piece of shit?
4560100	4565100	Robbie, it's a...
4565100	4566100	Write a song, Robbie.
4566100	4567100	Write a song.
4567100	4569100	Oh, no, no, no, no.
4569100	4571100	Look what you did.
4571100	4574100	It's you.
4574100	4576100	I'm out of here.
4576100	4578100	That's a Harmon Town second.
4578100	4579100	Yeah.
4579100	4580100	Not often enough.
4580100	4581100	He did leave his phone, though.
4581100	4582100	Yeah.
4582100	4583100	Oh, good.
4583100	4584100	It's a good chance Tina phased numbers.
4584100	4585100	It's a good bit, then.
4585100	4586100	He left.
4586100	4587100	He actually left.
4587100	4588100	But that's...
4588100	4592100	It's hard to question somebody out of the room.
4592100	4594100	I mean, even for, like, pros.
4594100	4595100	Wait, did he really leave?
4595100	4596100	I hope.
4596100	4598100	No, I'm kidding.
4598100	4602100	I wouldn't want to be subjected to that.
4603100	4608100	Yeah, a culture was created during the question of, like...
4608100	4610100	Robbie, come back.
4610100	4614100	It's hard to explain to the listener what Dan did in that moment.
4614100	4617100	Every little fool can see him.
4617100	4618100	I was wrong.
4618100	4622100	It was almost like a man dancing with a strobe light over him.
4622100	4623100	I know it is.
4623100	4628100	We saw moments of poses and emotions were definitely coming through.
4628100	4629100	It was very emotional.
4629100	4632100	It's what the evil teacher does in Fairly Odd Parents
4632100	4633100	when he says fairy godpeas.
4633100	4635100	Yeah, it had some of that.
4635100	4636100	It had some of that.
4640100	4641100	I haven't seen that.
4641100	4643100	He does these poses.
4643100	4644100	Various ones.
4646100	4647100	All right, so...
4647100	4648100	But I think you should continue...
4648100	4649100	Go ahead, continue the question.
4649100	4650100	I mean, I think...
4650100	4651100	Well, why not?
4651100	4652100	Why not finish the question?
4652100	4653100	No, I'm just curious...
4653100	4654100	What difference at this point...
4654100	4656100	This is what I want to know from musicians all the time.
4657100	4659100	How does the...
4663100	4666100	How does the brick that is a song...
4666100	4668100	How does it get generated?
4668100	4670100	What do you mean by the brick?
4670100	4672100	When does he know he's done or when does he know he's on to something?
4672100	4674100	Do they generate music by the yard?
4674100	4678100	And then do they cut here and there and go, okay, there's a song?
4678100	4681100	Or do they generate it in a pile?
4681100	4684100	Is it delivering a song like a baby?
4684100	4687100	It's like three minutes of...
4687100	4691100	If I can answer for Robbie, I think...
4691100	4693100	You're gonna have to.
4693100	4695100	No, I think...
4695100	4698100	I do think there's a difference between playing music and writing music,
4698100	4702100	because it takes three minutes to play three minutes of music.
4702100	4703100	Right, okay, I follow you.
4703100	4706100	Right, whereas what we do usually takes a lot longer.
4706100	4708100	It's like improv.
4708100	4710100	You know how long it takes to make six minutes of improv.
4710100	4711100	Six minutes.
4711100	4712100	Right.
4713100	4715100	But writing a song is a whole different thing.
4715100	4718100	I mean, do you wait for inspiration?
4718100	4719100	Yeah, exactly.
4719100	4720100	Ask him that.
4720100	4722100	Ask him that, it becomes bad.
4722100	4723100	That could be good.
4723100	4724100	It's a great question.
4724100	4726100	Do you wait for inspiration or do you just approach it like,
4726100	4728100	okay, I'm gonna see what comes out of me?
4728100	4729100	Yeah.
4729100	4730100	I know, it's a great question.
4730100	4732100	God, I wonder what the answer is.
4732100	4734100	Rob, why do you look so pissed?
4734100	4735100	What's that?
4735100	4737100	Rob looks very pissed.
4737100	4739100	No, just this fucking chair sucks.
4739100	4741100	Oh, okay.
4741100	4743100	Hurts if you sit here long enough.
4743100	4744100	Right?
4744100	4745100	Right?
4745100	4746100	Sorry.
4746100	4747100	I'm sorry, what?
4747100	4749100	There's no back support.
4749100	4750100	There's no back support.
4750100	4752100	Oh, okay, cool.
4752100	4758100	All right, so if I don't, so like we will, we'll, we'll, we're making a renewed vow to
4758100	4759100	work on our joint project.
4759100	4761100	Yeah, I think it's a great idea.
4761100	4763100	We'll, we'll, we'll, I have an idea for it.
4763100	4765100	You have an idea for it?
4765100	4766100	Well, I'm not an idea.
4766100	4767100	Let's hear it.
4767100	4770100	I don't have an idea for it.
4770100	4775100	No, I, I, my ideas is to make it a period piece, which I'll talk to you about.
4775100	4776100	Like 80s?
4776100	4778100	No, like menstruation, like.
4778100	4779100	Whoa.
4779100	4780100	That can be good.
4780100	4781100	No, no, no, no.
4781100	4784100	Like, like, yeah, like 80s or, or, or, or.
4784100	4787100	Did you, what, what was the first show you worked on?
4787100	4789100	It was your own show, right?
4789100	4790100	Yeah.
4790100	4791100	It was, right?
4791100	4792100	You didn't ever did multicam.
4792100	4794100	I never, you worked on The Golden Girls.
4794100	4795100	That was your.
4795100	4796100	I did, I did.
4796100	4799100	Which I started binging and it was like, it's such an amazing, like.
4799100	4802100	It was a, it was good learning experience.
4802100	4806100	Did we talk about when you were on the show, did we have the conversation where it was
4806100	4812100	like, how, how needless it was that Sophia was originally portrayed as like having had
4812100	4816100	a stroke and that that's the justification for why she was so flimsy.
4816100	4817100	But that was the justification.
4817100	4820100	There was so much energy put into like, but your mom.
4820100	4821100	But your mother, look, she had a stroke.
4821100	4824100	It destroyed the part of her brain that sensors her speech.
4824100	4828100	So she, so she's a really old lady that just says whatever she wants as if that
4828100	4830100	needed a medical justification.
4830100	4833100	The one character you're explaining the personality of.
4833100	4835100	It's supposed to like, and then be Arthur's character.
4835100	4838100	Well, you know, her singulum occipital lobes.
4838100	4839100	Right.
4839100	4841100	Fire in conjunction with her.
4841100	4842100	She's in an atmosphere.
4842100	4843100	She's in an atmosphere.
4843100	4844100	She's in an atmosphere.
4844100	4845100	She's in an atmosphere.
4845100	4846100	She's in an atmosphere.
4846100	4847100	She's generating an extra estrogen.
4847100	4848100	She's creating estrogen.
4848100	4849100	She's dripping down her labia.
4849100	4850100	And an enormous rate.
4850100	4851100	Yeah.
4851100	4854100	Well, hey, you agree then it would be a bad idea.
4854100	4857100	Every personality explained through chemistry.
4857100	4858100	Every golden girl.
4858100	4859100	Yeah.
4859100	4860100	Yeah.
4860100	4863100	Although I will say at the time it was not a cool show to be.
4863100	4865100	It was great to be on that show.
4865100	4866100	It was an amazing learning experience.
4866100	4867100	Which season were you on?
4867100	4871100	I guess I started at the end of season four.
4871100	4873100	No, end of season five.
4873100	4875100	And then I was on it through the end.
4875100	4880100	Because in binging it, it seems like I felt like you could feel the show get worse.
4880100	4881100	No.
4881100	4882100	Because it kind of did.
4882100	4883100	I mean, it did.
4883100	4885100	You know, what happens is you start using the tricks of the trade.
4885100	4889100	Well, there was what I felt like I perceived was a really solid first season.
4889100	4893100	That was undoubtedly probably a show that people probably didn't put a lot behind.
4893100	4895100	Well, and that Susan Harris created.
4895100	4898100	And she was and is a genius.
4898100	4900100	And it was like it just rained like this.
4900100	4902100	And she's Sam Harris' mom, by the way.
4902100	4903100	It was so efficient.
4903100	4906100	And then you could sense at the beginning of the second season, the second season premiere
4906100	4910100	began with like the fucking ferrets and the cages in the garage or whatever.
4910100	4914100	And it was, it was as if like the floodgates had opened and like, all right,
4914100	4916100	congratulations, you got season two.
4916100	4917100	Now, here's the thing.
4917100	4919100	We got so-and-so coming in.
4919100	4920100	He used to show run.
4920100	4922100	No, actually, that was not the case.
4922100	4925100	I think it was, believe it or not, it premiered at number one.
4925100	4926100	It was just one of those weird things.
4926100	4928100	Nobody had programmed to older people.
4928100	4932100	And nobody had programmed successfully on Saturday night, I guess,
4932100	4934100	since like Mary Tyler Moore or something.
4934100	4936100	And it just became number one in the country.
4936100	4937100	It was a huge thing.
4937100	4939100	Although it wasn't a hip show.
4939100	4942100	So I, you know, I didn't walk off of there with like a great,
4942100	4944100	like the guys who were on Cheers and that kind of thing.
4944100	4945100	Right.
4945100	4946100	But it was, it was incredible.
4946100	4951100	And even just, just being able to see, you know, these four amazing actresses naked was...
4951100	4952100	I know.
4953100	4955100	That was back when you were allowed to just like...
4955100	4956100	Oh my God, you were expected to.
4956100	4957100	Yeah.
4958100	4959100	It was their duty.
4959100	4960100	It was a show of respect.
4962100	4965100	But what was the, what was the tone like on set?
4965100	4966100	Was it season four?
4966100	4967100	Like was there...
4967100	4968100	I think it was season five.
4968100	4971100	If you make it to season four, you're allowed for, I think the actors are allowed
4971100	4973100	to actually all hate each other.
4973100	4977100	I don't think, I mean, I think Betty, you know, played to the crowd and everything.
4977100	4980100	And, and, and B was, you know, they didn't get along great.
4980100	4981100	They were opposite.
4981100	4986100	I always thought there were opposites in the sense that B was kind of scary on the outside,
4986100	4988100	but so sweet on the inside.
4988100	4993100	And, you know, Betty is so sweet on the outside and a little scary on the inside.
4993100	4996100	She fucking put Chevy's nuts in a vice when she was on Community.
4996100	4997100	Oh really?
4997100	5000100	I don't really have like a wonderful anecdote about that.
5000100	5005100	But it was like, it was more, honestly, it's more credit to Chevy because I think Chevy,
5005100	5011100	like he, it was more about him respecting her so much that it was very easy for her
5011100	5013100	to kind of wither him.
5013100	5017100	It was something like, she just met him and she was like, she said something like,
5017100	5020100	I've heard about you and that's okay.
5020100	5024100	Or something, just some bit that was sort of like, and he was like, what?
5024100	5027100	And everyone was like laughing at him and you could see him be like, goddamn.
5027100	5028100	Yeah, that sounds like her.
5028100	5032100	She was very direct and yet, you know, because she's sort of fearless.
5032100	5037100	And she, yeah, that was always, you know, also B, Arthur had to do all her scenes with Estelle.
5037100	5041100	Estelle had memory problems, which we later found out was deeper than that.
5041100	5045100	And so B would have to do her scenes 20, 30 times.
5045100	5047100	So she was just in a bad mood, you know?
5047100	5050100	And also there was, well, I'm not going to tell that story.
5050100	5052100	That's true.
5052100	5053100	Because you make up a different story?
5053100	5054100	Yes.
5054100	5055100	Okay.
5055100	5059100	No, that's, I'll tell everybody off the air.
5059100	5069100	But no, it was, I remember when I met Betty, I had said, oh, they want me to tell you
5069100	5072100	they're doing a, they're doing a layout upstairs.
5072100	5073100	And she said, oh, yes.
5073100	5075100	And someone took pictures.
5075100	5078100	And I just looked at her confused.
5078100	5079100	You know what I mean?
5079100	5080100	She's just, she was saucy.
5080100	5082100	She was always being, yeah, there's a layout.
5082100	5084100	Like, you know, I was fucking upstairs.
5084100	5087100	It was, I think, her point of view on that.
5087100	5090100	She told it much better.
5090100	5093100	But that's amazing that you did not have to go through that.
5093100	5095100	Because it was, that was a great experience.
5095100	5097100	But a lot of the other shows I was on was not.
5097100	5101100	I mean, it was, I didn't just, you know, you're not doing your voice.
5101100	5102100	Yeah.
5102100	5103100	That's, I suffered for that entirely.
5103100	5108100	That's the thing is like, if I could do it all over again, I spent so many years like
5108100	5110100	just writing kind of in vain.
5110100	5114100	I guess it's easy to say, cause I know now that all the things that I wrote in
5114100	5117100	between, you know, it's like, they didn't go anywhere anyway.
5117100	5122100	So I may as well have been in someone else's writer's room, but it, God damn,
5122100	5128100	I suffered as a showrunner because I went from, uh, I, I was in, I was an officer
5128100	5130100	and I was never an unlisted man.
5130100	5131100	Right.
5131100	5133100	Well, that, I mean, that's true, but I think, I think when you have a strong
5133100	5136100	point of view, it's show running as a whole other thing.
5136100	5137100	I mean, it really is.
5137100	5139100	It's like, it's like being a chef and then someone's saying, okay, now we've got
5139100	5140100	a hundred of these to make.
5140100	5141100	Right.
5141100	5144100	But understanding that if you have 10 people that cost a total of a million
5144100	5147100	dollars of the studio's money, and they're there to help you and that you
5147100	5151100	can't actually offend them by saying, for instance, I think we can beat this
5151100	5152100	joke.
5152100	5158100	Just things that I had to learn so slowly that had I come up as a staff writer,
5158100	5161100	I could have been like on point season one.
5161100	5164100	Well, I mean, possibly I would say like the best thing for people who want to
5164100	5167100	write and that kind of thing, you know, it's going to sound counterintuitive,
5167100	5171100	but I do think when you're in those jobs and you're coming up, it's you want
5171100	5172100	to be of service.
5172100	5175100	You want to be of support, you know, and I think it is a bad impulse, even
5175100	5178100	though I had it say, well, when do I get my voice out there?
5178100	5179100	When do I do my thing?
5179100	5182100	I do think the experiences support someone.
5182100	5183100	Yeah.
5183100	5186100	And it does give you a different perspective when you're in that job and
5186100	5189100	sometimes not a better perspective because you're upset when people aren't
5189100	5190100	supporting you.
5190100	5192100	But that's the skill set.
5192100	5193100	Yeah.
5193100	5197100	Well, your primary instinct is what kind of hack would I be if I told another
5197100	5203100	writer that what they had written for me was not good enough for me?
5203100	5209100	All of your training as a supposedly amazing writer tells you that's what a
5209100	5211100	shitty writer would do.
5211100	5213100	Like you don't tell another writer.
5213100	5216100	Listen, when you're working in a creative field and there's a lot of people
5216100	5220100	working together, it's hard to be direct about that stuff.
5220100	5224100	And someone recently said to me, I was in a room and I said, oh, that's
5224100	5225100	funny.
5225100	5227100	When somebody pitched something, another writer said, that means it's not
5227100	5228100	funny.
5228100	5229100	That's what it says.
5229100	5230100	And I realize it's true.
5230100	5232100	I've just done that for so long.
5232100	5233100	Like, oh, that's funny.
5233100	5236100	And then hope this conversation changes.
5236100	5239100	And then I go, no wrong answers.
5239100	5241100	Yeah, no wrong answers.
5241100	5243100	Wait a minute.
5243100	5244100	Yeah.
5244100	5245100	Yeah.
5245100	5247100	When Wolf.
5247100	5248100	Come on.
5248100	5249100	All right.
5249100	5251100	The people have spoken.
5251100	5252100	When Wolf.
5252100	5254100	But, yeah, it is.
5254100	5257100	It's just interesting to me that that could be a form of selfishness when
5257100	5259100	you believe that you're doing it.
5259100	5265100	How much not communicating with other people, like you think you can think
5265100	5270100	that that makes you non-abusive, for instance, not it makes you.
5270100	5271100	Right.
5271100	5272100	Being direct is better.
5272100	5273100	Being honest is better.
5273100	5274100	Yeah.
5274100	5275100	Other doesn't feel like it.
5275100	5278100	If you close your office door and are just like, I'll just do it.
5278100	5280100	And they're like, you close the office door.
5280100	5285100	It's like, that's a form of abuse to a person that's like, but I don't know
5285100	5287100	what I did wrong.
5287100	5291100	The other revelation of that kind of job, and I know a lot of people here are
5291100	5294100	pursuing that kind of career, is that you're working your way up.
5294100	5295100	You're trying to find your thing.
5295100	5297100	You're trying to be funnier if you're in comedy.
5297100	5299100	You're trying to get your pilot made and that kind of thing.
5299100	5301100	And then finally you do.
5301100	5306100	And you've got all these employees and you just have no preparation to have
5306100	5307100	people work for you.
5307100	5309100	It's just not part of what you've been planning.
5309100	5311100	You haven't been thinking, I'm going to be a manager of people.
5311100	5314100	I'm going to worry about their time off.
5314100	5316100	I'm going to make sure that their feelings are okay.
5316100	5317100	It's just not there.
5317100	5320100	Oh, and by the way, I can't wait to read all their shit because that's why I
5320100	5321100	became a writer.
5321100	5322100	I love reading.
5322100	5323100	Yeah.
5323100	5326100	And you have to kind of make the shift that it's, I mean, it sounds corny,
5326100	5327100	but that it's a privilege.
5327100	5331100	Like you have to realize, you know, and it took me a while to realize, like,
5331100	5336100	this is a real benefit that I get to have people that count on me.
5336100	5337100	They're happy.
5337100	5339100	But at first it's a, it's an imposition.
5339100	5341100	Would you put a shock collar on your dog?
5341100	5344100	No.
5344100	5345100	Do you know that?
5345100	5346100	What part of my dog?
5346100	5350100	Like a, because there are, there are parts that would be funny.
5350100	5353100	Vibration and a sound collars.
5353100	5356100	Well, are you, what, what behavior are you trying to modify?
5356100	5360100	Barking.
5360100	5362100	No, you're just going to terrorize your dog.
5362100	5364100	You're not going to teach the dog to not bark.
5364100	5366100	That's not what the Amazon reviews say.
5366100	5367100	There you go.
5367100	5369100	Then fucking do whatever you want.
5369100	5371100	I think you're supposed to praise them when they're not barking.
5371100	5373100	So just constantly praise them.
5373100	5375100	And then when they bark, just be quiet.
5375100	5380100	Harvey, I think.
5380100	5382100	Shit.
5382100	5384100	I think a lot of people's dogs do.
5384100	5385100	Yeah.
5385100	5387100	That's one of the main things that dogs do.
5387100	5390100	When they're not just hanging out being dogs, they're barking.
5390100	5391100	Right.
5391100	5396100	Harvey seems to be, I think that he's, I think that the new house being
5396100	5398100	bigger and empty.
5398100	5403100	I think he's just, he's, he's barking more and more.
5403100	5406100	And it's almost like how we've talked more since Robbie left.
5406100	5407100	Right.
5407100	5409100	And they've talked more.
5409100	5412100	Like the dog is doing you a favor.
5412100	5415100	It's got a bigger space to protect.
5415100	5420100	So anytime it sees anything that is foreign or dangerous,
5421100	5423100	Oh, shit.
5423100	5424100	It's alerting it.
5424100	5426100	So they love this point you're making.
5426100	5427100	Yeah.
5427100	5428100	They love this point you're making.
5428100	5429100	You're right.
5429100	5430100	It is.
5430100	5431100	It's an ease protecting the family.
5431100	5432100	Yeah.
5432100	5434100	Robbie and I just made love in the green room.
5434100	5436100	What?
5436100	5438100	You forgot your phone.
5438100	5439100	Oh,
5441100	5442100	Tina called.
5442100	5443100	Yeah.
5443100	5449100	She does not appreciate the dick pic that Rob sent.
5450100	5451100	Dan.
5451100	5454100	Do you know any country songs that you can sing or any folk songs?
5454100	5457100	I mean, we have an opportunity here for like, you could sing whatever you
5457100	5458100	want.
5459100	5460100	Oh my God.
5460100	5462100	This guy is still in here.
5462100	5463100	Yeah.
5464100	5467100	Country songs like existing country songs.
5467100	5471100	Also hilariously, I probably the sales might've been down on this, but
5471100	5475100	Robbie made like how many years ago did you make the Michael Jackson cover
5475100	5476100	album?
5477100	5478100	What?
5478100	5480100	You made a Michael Jackson cover album.
5480100	5484100	It's all covers and your, your, your version of man in the mirror is fucking
5484100	5485100	outrageous.
5485100	5488100	It's really good, but now probably not so big on the charts.
5489100	5491100	Well, it's good to take it from him.
5491100	5494100	You know, it's like, let's do different versions of all this stuff and then we
5494100	5496100	could disassociate it with Michael Jackson.
5496100	5497100	That could be good.
5497100	5498100	Go out and check it out.
5498100	5499100	What's the record called?
5499100	5501100	It's called happy.
5503100	5504100	It is.
5504100	5505100	Are you a Willie Nelson fan?
5505100	5506100	Sure.
5506100	5507100	Yeah.
5507100	5508100	I would say no.
5508100	5509100	No, fuck Willie Nelson.
5509100	5513100	But like, yeah, Willie Nelson reminds me of my parents getting along.
5513100	5514100	Like it was like,
5516100	5519100	like when they weren't fighting, they would, they would put on a Willie
5519100	5524100	Nelson album and then, you know, Southern Comfort on the Rocks and a fireplace
5524100	5526100	going and it was like Willie Nelson.
5526100	5530100	So I guess those are the only country songs that I like.
5531100	5534100	Which one do you think, you know, some of the words blue eyes crying in the
5534100	5535100	rain.
5535100	5537100	Well, is it, are you pushing for that?
5537100	5541100	Cause you're like, your fingers are, can't wait to, cause I, that one, that
5541100	5545100	one, I don't, I don't, you're like, well, there's a, there's the two cowboy
5545100	5549100	ones, mom, like, like, I think it's like the two that are the, uh, urban, urban
5549100	5554100	cowboy, uh, uh, right now electric, uh, horseman, uh, soundtrack, uh, Robert,
5554100	5556100	Robert, uh, Redford and Jane Fonda.
5556100	5557100	That's terrible.
5557100	5559100	Mama's don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.
5559100	5560100	And then, uh, what's the other one?
5560100	5561100	That's Cowboys.
5561100	5563100	I don't know.
5563100	5565100	I think it's like a whole Willie Nelson soundtrack.
5565100	5567100	Like Redhead strangers on there.
5567100	5570100	But there's a, what's the other cowboy Willie Nelson song where it's like, uh,
5570100	5575100	there's another one that's like, uh, Cowboys fucking, what'd you say?
5576100	5577100	Punch on lefty.
5577100	5578100	No.
5578100	5581100	I feel like it's like almost like you hear the titles and you're kind of
5581100	5582100	like, didn't you already do that song?
5582100	5585100	It's like, one's like mama's don't let your, God damn it.
5585100	5588100	And there's another one that's like, Cowboys do this or that.
5588100	5589100	And they don't do that.
5589100	5590100	Yeah.
5590100	5592100	The cowboy rule book.
5592100	5593100	Yeah.
5593100	5594100	I think that's what it is.
5594100	5595100	The cowboy rule book.
5595100	5596100	Yeah.
5596100	5597100	Might be that.
5597100	5600100	Why don't, why don't we write the cowboy rule book song right now?
5600100	5601100	All right.
5601100	5602100	Okay.
5602100	5603100	I'll allow Willie Nelson.
5603100	5604100	You're right.
5604100	5606100	Nelson brings you the cowboy rule book.
5606100	5614100	These are the rules of the cowboy.
5614100	5617100	Cowboys.
5617100	5621100	Never wear blue jeans.
5621100	5623100	Whoa.
5623100	5626100	After labor day.
5626100	5632100	When there's rattlesnakes born.
5632100	5636100	Cowboys never drink whiskey.
5636100	5641100	Outside a saloon with no wifi.
5641100	5649100	Cause they never want any forlornness.
5649100	5653100	These are the rules for Cowboys.
5653100	5655100	These are the rules.
5655100	5660100	Cause they have every cowboy.
5660100	5661100	Always.
5661100	5662100	Yeah.
5662100	5663100	Never.
5663100	5664100	Never has the rules.
5664100	5665100	Yeah.
5665100	5667100	No, you got the idea.
5667100	5675100	Cowboys are always riding around with a horsey.
5675100	5684100	If two Cowboys meet the one on the left has to dance.
5684100	5689100	That's not the end.
5689100	5697100	If three Cowboys join up in a market, they have to have a quorum.
5698100	5707100	If there's 11 Cowboys or less, there can only be three pants.
5707100	5715100	Any carpet a cowboy walks on is now magic.
5715100	5723100	That means it can lift up to four Cowboys in its weight.
5723100	5732100	If you go to a restaurant with four that seven or cowboys,
5732100	5739100	you have to give the cowboy to your right half your plate.
5739100	5740100	Okay.
5740100	5741100	Cowboys.
5741100	5744100	These are the rules.
5744100	5749100	These are the cowboy rules.
5749100	5751100	These are the rules.
5751100	5756100	The cowboys have to follow boys.
5756100	5766100	When the cow boys come home, they got a rule book.
5766100	5777100	But cowboys always follow every rule.
5777100	5785100	I think that's, I think that's the, I hope Willie Nelson doesn't hear that.
5785100	5791100	Because he'll think I was doing Harrison Ford or David Duchovny.
5791100	5795100	So when you write a song like that, Dan.
5795100	5797100	Dan, what's your process, Dan?
5797100	5800100	When you're a musician and you're writing a song like that.
5800100	5803100	First, I'll hear something in the shower.
5803100	5805100	And I'm like, is the radio on?
5805100	5809100	And then they'll be like, no, that's my heart.
5809100	5811100	But for real though, Robbie.
5811100	5812100	That means you're the real deal.
5812100	5815100	Country music, especially not just country, but like pop music too.
5815100	5819100	But country, like a lot of songs are like, oh, I found a great title of a song.
5819100	5822100	And I'm going to write the song around that title.
5822100	5823100	Like, do you ever do that?
5823100	5827100	Like, do you think of like, oh, that should be a song, that phrase that I just thought of or heard.
5827100	5831100	Like Schitt's Creek.
5832100	5834100	Yeah, absolutely.
5834100	5839100	I think that's the country away.
5839100	5843100	Start with a hook with a title and kind of work around that.
5843100	5847100	That's just like TV writing in a way.
5847100	5849100	Is it?
5849100	5851100	Arrested development.
5851100	5856100	I want this episode to be called an evening to remember.
5856100	5859100	That was often like an NBC mid-season show kind of thing.
5859100	5864100	You could expect like six shows that were like swiped to the left.
5864100	5867100	They were like, OK, that's six an hour.
5867100	5868100	Yes, the hip show.
5868100	5871100	Yeah, it was always like sexting.
5871100	5873100	OMG.
5873100	5877100	But you can't complain about them because you never know which one of those is going to be like.
5877100	5884100	Because there's always something on the air that's like, 83 reasons my daughter's my uncle in the future.
5885100	5888100	They didn't expect that to go more than 11.
5888100	5890100	They're like, yeah, here we are.
5890100	5891100	No backup plan.
5891100	5893100	There's no wrong answers in TV.
5893100	5896100	There's no wrong answers when you're TV.
5896100	5898100	Here's my real songwriting question.
5898100	5902100	Do you give yourself an assignment or do you just wait to see what comes to you?
5902100	5907100	Will you say like, all right, this weekend I really want to at least put something down?
5907100	5910100	Well, to be honest, I don't like writing that well.
5910100	5912100	It's not fun, you know.
5912100	5913100	Same page.
5913100	5916100	You don't have to wait for a reason, you know.
5916100	5918100	You have to make your own reason.
5918100	5920100	In television, you don't have to.
5920100	5922100	You know, you've got a deadline.
5922100	5925100	Well, maybe once in a while somebody will throw me a project or something.
5925100	5928100	But yeah, usually it's like, oh, it's time to do another record, you know.
5928100	5931100	So you ain't got to write the record.
5931100	5932100	Hard.
5932100	5934100	It's hard.
5934100	5936100	I got a project for you, Robbie, folks.
5936100	5938100	It's an app called Chordbot.
5938100	5941100	I use it to make my own songs while I work out.
5941100	5944100	And you can hit this button and it goes song-o-matic.
5944100	5947100	And it gives you a four, what are they called, measures?
5947100	5949100	You're like, what is what called?
5949100	5950100	Bars.
5950100	5952100	Bars is probably what it is.
5952100	5954100	And then you hit the thing and then it goes like...
5959100	5961100	C major.
5961100	5962100	F major.
5962100	5964100	Those are great chords.
5964100	5966100	E flat major.
5966100	5967100	I'm a big C major fan.
5967100	5968100	A minor.
5968100	5969100	I love it.
5970100	5972100	What do you think about that?
5972100	5975100	Are you scared like John Henry was in the steam engine?
5975100	5978100	Don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys.
5978100	5979100	You're a little scared, aren't you?
5979100	5980100	Yeah, it's like the steam engine.
5980100	5982100	You're like, oh, there's a little Robbie folks in my phone.
5982100	5983100	You're like, what's happening?
5983100	5985100	What is this witchcraft?
5985100	5987100	Robbie, play it.
5987100	5989100	See it away.
5989100	5991100	This is because you can have this.
5991100	5993100	Where are you coming from?
5993100	5994100	The phone doesn't own this.
5994100	5996100	It made it up.
5996100	5997100	Yeah.
5997100	5998100	That's two.
5999100	6000100	Three.
6001100	6002100	C.
6002100	6004100	When are you coming home?
6007100	6009100	When are you coming home?
6012100	6015100	When are you coming home?
6018100	6020100	When are you coming home?
6021100	6023100	I tell you, it really seems to work.
6023100	6025100	When are you coming home?
6025100	6026100	That's a great song.
6026100	6028100	No, you're not helping Rob.
6028100	6030100	That's not helping.
6030100	6033100	Robbie was like, why is that?
6033100	6036100	That's vandalism, what you're doing.
6037100	6038100	When are you coming home?
6038100	6039100	You're like distracting him.
6039100	6040100	You're like 4chan.
6040100	6041100	You're the 4chan of this song.
6041100	6042100	Wait, wait, wait.
6042100	6043100	When are you coming home?
6043100	6044100	I want to see you.
6044100	6045100	What?
6047100	6048100	Keep going, Dan.
6048100	6050100	Dan, Robbie, keep going.
6050100	6051100	What?
6051100	6052100	No, not Rob's job.
6052100	6053100	Yeah, tell him.
6053100	6054100	Rob's job probation.
6054100	6055100	But that's the real world.
6055100	6058100	When you write a song, there's always someone who's trying to get in there and ruin it for you.
6059100	6060100	So it prepares you for that.
6060100	6061100	Yeah, that's what I do.
6061100	6063100	Yeah, there's always going to be a count at work.
6063100	6066100	I was about to create a song with a legendary songwriter.
6066100	6071100	Does the song, Robbie, your song Fuck This Town, is that based on actual autobiography
6071100	6072100	of being in Nashville?
6073100	6074100	Yeah, it is, Jeff.
6074100	6078100	Fuck This Town, we were driving along.
6078100	6081100	People always say town in Nashville, like it's kind of a folksy saying,
6081100	6084100	you know, it's a city, you know, they're always saying this town.
6084100	6087100	And we're driving along a bunch of songwriters in the 90s or whatever.
6087100	6089100	Somebody goes, oh, it's a five-year town, Nashville.
6089100	6090100	We've got to be patient.
6090100	6091100	It's a five-year town.
6091100	6093100	Somebody goes, well, the town is really...
6093100	6094100	And I was in the back.
6094100	6096100	I said, like, hey, fuck this town, you know?
6097100	6098100	Hey, that's a good song title.
6098100	6099100	It is.
6100100	6101100	Wait, fuck it in the end.
6101100	6102100	Fuck it up and down.
6103100	6104100	Fuck it end to end.
6104100	6105100	Fuck it end to end.
6105100	6106100	Fuck it up and down.
6106100	6107100	Up and down.
6107100	6108100	That's very punk rock.
6108100	6110100	So what is the...
6110100	6112100	Given that the attitude of that...
6112100	6114100	But sometimes you do have to get angry.
6114100	6115100	You know what I mean?
6115100	6116100	That's true.
6116100	6119100	That's a question I have about country western is like, what are the things
6119100	6120100	that demarcate?
6120100	6124100	Because there's been controversies lately where it's like a hip-hop guy,
6124100	6129100	like the content of his rap was like him riding on a horse or whatever.
6129100	6132100	And then they were like, oh, that's not eligible for whatever.
6132100	6134100	And it's like, what is the...
6134100	6137100	I'm assuming the answer is it's not definitive.
6137100	6141100	But like in your mind, what makes the difference between the genres of music?
6141100	6144100	Like what is country western that separates it?
6144100	6146100	Is it about musical?
6146100	6147100	Like seriously?
6147100	6148100	Yeah.
6148100	6149100	Like is it an engineering answer?
6149100	6150100	Yeah.
6150100	6151100	What is the definition of country western?
6152100	6153100	No, I agree.
6153100	6155100	Like obviously we hear it.
6155100	6156100	You can tell...
6156100	6157100	I thought you were mocking my question.
6157100	6158100	So that's why I love it.
6158100	6159100	Yeah.
6159100	6160100	So I'll tell you what I think.
6160100	6164100	I think I'm a little bit divorced from what's been going on in country music
6164100	6166100	for the last oath 25, 35 years.
6166100	6167100	I'm not real up on it.
6167100	6170100	But I think it's like still connected to what it was in the sense that it's
6170100	6171100	kitchen sing songs.
6171100	6173100	It's like universal subjects.
6173100	6178100	It's like, you know, it's like microscoped down to the level of the family
6178100	6182100	and the, you know, a couple individuals in a house trying to get along,
6182100	6183100	things like that.
6183100	6189100	And I think it does that better than stories about that in simple language,
6189100	6193100	better than any other genre maybe.
6194100	6197100	A song of yours, you have a lot of upbeat, happy songs,
6197100	6201100	but you've got some really lonely, sad songs.
6201100	6202100	And it's about great singing.
6202100	6203100	Excuse me.
6203100	6204100	Yeah.
6204100	6205100	Everybody in country music.
6205100	6206100	You have a fucking range.
6206100	6209100	You can sing real high and you've got a big ass range.
6209100	6210100	You can't hide your voice.
6210100	6211100	There's nowhere to...
6211100	6212100	You're right up there.
6212100	6213100	Front and center.
6213100	6215100	There's a song for listeners to go check out,
6215100	6217100	Forgotten But Not Gone.
6217100	6220100	That song is sad as fuck, but I love it.
6220100	6223100	It's really like lonesome and great.
6223100	6224100	Thank you.
6224100	6227100	This podcast needs more compliments than that.
6227100	6230100	But you also need to be kept humble with a run for your money
6230100	6232100	from the algorithm.
6232100	6234100	Oh, here we go.
6236100	6237100	Because listen to this, Robbie.
6237100	6238100	By algo rhythm.
6238100	6241100	I can add a guitar to this.
6241100	6243100	Hold on.
6243100	6245100	Acoustic guitar.
6247100	6248100	Uh-oh.
6248100	6249100	Uh-oh.
6253100	6254100	Rob, stop it.
6257100	6258100	No, Rob.
6266100	6271100	Robbie, folks, I'm the algorithm.
6271100	6274100	I've come to take your soul to hell.
6275100	6280100	You believe that your music will save you,
6280100	6284100	but I have a different tale to tell.
6286100	6293100	I was born on Golgotha next to Christ with bones in my femurs.
6296100	6299100	That's where everyone has bones.
6304100	6306100	Big deal.
6306100	6310100	My name is Beelzebub.
6310100	6312100	So that wouldn't be a country song?
6312100	6313100	No.
6313100	6314100	Like as an example.
6314100	6318100	Robbie, what key is Ramblin' Fever in?
6318100	6319100	Is that the same key?
6319100	6324100	You know, Jeff, we were doing it in E back there during the hiatus.
6324100	6327100	If you know it, you all know Merle Haggard.
6327100	6329100	No, one person went, who?
6329100	6330100	What is Merle Haggard?
6330100	6331100	Merle Haggard.
6331100	6333100	Yeah, he's just...
6335100	6336100	It's a song called Ramblin' Fever.
6336100	6338100	And is it okay if Mitch and I go into the green room
6338100	6341100	and speak really loudly about Golden Girls for the next ten minutes?
6341100	6343100	Well, that way the audience gets it all.
6343100	6344100	With no explanation?
6344100	6345100	They get everything.
6345100	6346100	Or should we be polite?
6346100	6347100	They get it all at the same time.
6347100	6349100	It's like the climax of it.
6349100	6353100	There might be a Vincent Price, like, middle section of this.
6356100	6361100	My hat don't hang on the same nail too long, just me or you.
6361100	6366100	My ears can't stand to hear the same old song
6366100	6370100	And I don't stay on one road long enough
6370100	6374100	To bog down in the mud
6374100	6379100	Cause I've got Ramblin' Fever in my blood, Jeff B. Davis
6379100	6384100	I caught this Ramblin' Fever long ago
6384100	6389100	When I first heard a lonesome whistle blow
6389100	6392100	If someone ever said I gave a damn
6392100	6396100	Well, they damn sure told you wrong
6396100	6400100	I've had a Ramblin' Fever all along
6400100	6402100	Everyone join in.
6402100	6406100	Ramblin' Fever
6406100	6412100	The kind that can't be measured by degrees
6412100	6417100	Ramblin' Fever
6417100	6422100	There ain't no kind of cure for my disease
6422100	6427100	Well, there's times I'd like to bed down on a sofa
6427100	6432100	And let some pretty lady rub my back
6432100	6438100	And spend the early mornin' drinkin' coffee
6438100	6441100	Dreamin' about when I'll be comin' back
6441100	6442100	Take it, Robert.
6442100	6447100	Yeah, but I don't let no woman tie me down
6447100	6452100	And I'll never get too old to get around
6452100	6456100	I wanna die beside the highway and run away
6456100	6460100	Like some old highlighter pole
6460100	6465100	And rest this Ramblin' Fever in my soul
6465100	6467100	Alright, sing you motherfuckers
6467100	6471100	Ramblin' Fever
6471100	6475100	The kind that can't be measured by degrees
6475100	6477100	Ramblin' Fever
6477100	6480100	Ramblin' Fever
6480100	6482100	Ain't no kind of cure for my disease
6482100	6485100	Ain't no kind of cure for my disease
6485100	6487100	One more chorus
6487100	6492100	Ramblin' Fever
6492100	6496100	The kind that can't be measured by degrees
6496100	6498100	Thank you all for comin' to Harman Town, everybody.
6498100	6499100	Let's give it up for Mitch Hurwitz.
6499100	6501100	Rob Shroff.
6501100	6507100	I'm Jeff Davis. Give it up for Robbie Folks, everybody.
6507100	6512100	Spencer Crittenden. Dan Harman is your mayor.
6512100	6514100	Thank you so much.
6514100	6516100	Zach, put a beat on. Thank you all.
6516100	6517100	Drive fast and take chances.
6517100	6519100	Thank you so much for comin' down.

6521100	6524100	Watch Creepshow this Thursday.
6524100	6527100	My episode is on shutter.
6527100	6529100	Check it out.
6529100	6533100	Only reason I showed up tonight was to promote that.
6533100	6535100	Glad I got it in there.
6554100	6557100	Did you get any of that?
