0	22560	Hello. Welcome once again to Meltdown Comics in the Nerdmelt Theatre. Guess what everybody?
22560	34120	Harmon Town is now in session. Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmon Town, Dan
34120	49120	Hermit! Thank you. What a lovely, lovely group of people you seem to be on first impression,
49120	65440	at least. I got my notes. I got some notes. Well, of course we lost a legend today. Philip
65440	70600	Seymour Hoffman died. Let's start with that. You should always go with a high energy opener.
70600	77560	Were you connected to that? You heard the news? No, well it did and that's a testament
77560	83720	to the fact that how much respect I think that guy really is worthy of. It's like famous
83720	87000	people die and it's like we only have a relationship to their fame and they go like, well he was
87000	93760	famous. Hey, the guy that played Clinger on MASH died today and you're like, aw, you automatically
93760	101520	go aw because death is bad. Jimmy Farr died too? No, no. I didn't mean to upset you, no.
101520	106520	But I'm saying I was picking up a random person that's like, well, I mean, you only at this
106520	113400	point he's just a famous name. He's just a name you know. And then there's people that pass that
113400	120200	you go, oh shit, holy fuck, that's terrible that they're gone. And yes, I have equated that against
120200	125600	the fact that millions of us die every day. Philip Seymour Hoffman was worth a couple hundred
125600	130940	thousand normal people at least. He was a good fucking actor. I'm bummed he's dead even though
130940	136200	we all die every day. I watched a bunch of the footage, the coverage of it and I was bummed out
136200	142560	not that I was ever like very close to him. And I couldn't separate the idea that I think covering
142560	149400	this so much because he won an Oscar, because he's great, because he's a good theater actor or what,
149400	155320	but I was surprised the level of coverage that that got. Well, I think truly, I mean, this is,
155320	162120	no, I mean, well, here's my answer to that. He won an Oscar because he's great. There's coverage
162120	168120	because he won an Oscar. He won an Oscar because he's great. He was a theater actor. He was a good
168120	174400	fucking actor. He was really, really good. I watched Capote today. I don't know. We picked a
174400	181200	PSH movie to watch to mourn him. We rolled into Boogie Nights, but I had to come here. But every
181200	187560	movie he's in, he makes better. He's never been bad. He's just a good actor. He's one of those
187560	193840	rare actors who doesn't just inhabit characters and like, oh, that's amazing. He really seems
193840	198640	Russian. That's a good, that's a type of good acting. There's another type of good acting.
198640	203200	That's like, wow, Woody Allen's really good at being himself, even though he's just a writer on
203200	207520	screen, like talking about his feelings. That's another type of good acting. But Philip Seymour
207520	214600	Hoffman puts him, put himself into people who were nothing like him. And Capote was one of those
214600	220080	amazing, amazing examples. You really don't know what you're watching. If you see footage of
220080	225040	Truman Capote, and then you see footage of Philip Seymour Hoffman, and then you watch that movie,
225040	230960	you really are watching like a miracle happen. In my opinion, it's like true. He's not, he's not
230960	236080	doing a rich little impression of Truman Capote, but he's certainly like talking funny the way
236080	242040	Truman Capote did, which I have no idea how you could possibly do that and still emote. And there
242040	247240	are scenes in that movie, and that movie is riveting. Even if there was a bad actor in that
247240	251920	role, I think that would be one of my favorite stories. But the camera pushes on him, and it's
251920	259360	just fucking the only thing that's for sale, it's him just bursting into tears. And it is as amazing
259360	265280	as watching a fireworks display. Now he died, we can, I think, assume from the reports that we have
265280	272560	already that it was heroin overdose. That wasn't big news, like Justin Bieber egged some houses,
272560	277440	that's giant news. This guy was a heroin addict, and has kids, and is cool.
277440	280600	No, it wasn't. Well, he was struggling with it. It was like Robert Downey Jr. You know,
280600	285480	it was like, we were in his corner. He was struggling with it for a long time. And that's
285480	293440	the crazy thing about our point of view on drugs in this society. I find it very strange. He was
294440	300840	Hoffman was straight for 11 years or something. He battled and battled and battled with it. And we
300840	306160	all have to accept at this point, I'm not asking the truck drivers listening to shed a tear for
306160	310960	the famous actors of the world. But we have to accept at this point, with Heath Ledger and Robert
310960	316640	Downey Jr., and we have to accept that if you're really good, if you're really capable of genuine
316640	320800	charisma on camera, not a lot of us can fill that job. That there's something, there's some
320800	326680	overlap between that. And, you know, there's a challenge with with the stuff. And we so we go
326680	332000	back and forth between treating it as a challenge and as an indulgence. And I do want to give a
332000	338720	special wag of the wag of the dick to Val Kilmer for his terrible. Like I was looking at all the
338720	345800	celebrity tweets, you know, our new segment, Dan Harmon, the dick at Val Kilmer. Because every
345800	351000	week, you're gonna wag your dick at Val Kilmer. I'm on his case now. I got a week after week, I'm
351000	356600	gonna find I'm gonna I'm gonna call out Val Kilmer and something I'm gonna watch him now. Because
356640	363800	because I was surprised at the amount of class and restraint and genuine, sincere emotional
363800	370080	morning going on on Twitter, by famous people who aren't exactly famous all the time for their
370080	377160	tact. Their, I don't know, their, their grace. Sometimes if you're famous for being a really
377160	381040	good actor, maybe you're a bit of a jackass on Twitter. Sometimes you can be famous for being a
381040	388000	jackass on Twitter and do a show at meltdown pulling like 100 people. But the I was amazed
388000	392200	because I was I scanned down the list. They always do that aggregate story Hollywood reacts on
392200	398560	Twitter to screen legends death. And I was like, where's the where's the bad guy? Where is a
398840	407960	Val Kilmer? I got does anybody have his tweet pulled up? It was it was he kind of he did a lot of
407960	415280	prints like abbreviation like he he would spell blue BLU he didn't have time to blue day for the
415280	421520	thing was that like like the idea that that a good guy had died was about 10% of his 140 characters
421520	425960	and the rest of it was crammed in with abbreviations about how drugs are bad things.
425960	429560	Sometimes people feel like they need to escape through them. But you don't need to do that, man.
429560	434600	You got to keep you get to keep your strength up. You know, it's like, wow, a little that's a good
434600	442520	time to pontificate about your view on things in the middle of a eulogy. Pull up pull up a Val Kilmer
442520	447600	tweet right now. Thank you. Tyler in the front row has one for us. This is Val Kilmer's tweet. This
447600	455280	is a my new segment called tisk tisk Val Kilmer. Should we get theme music for that? Blue Day
455280	473680	spelled like Blu Ray. Tisk tisk Val Kilmer you did something naughty. I'm watching you you've acted
473680	492600	rather hard. Why you carry yourself that way online. Thank you. Blue Blue Day spelled like Blu Ray.
492600	496960	Let's give him the benefit of the doubt. That's auto correct, right? He's using a Sony phone. And
496960	506240	then you want a Blu Ray? The phone says no, it's a blue day. Sam Samsung Sony 2000. So it's sick
506240	515520	Blu Ray. It says no, no, no. Val Kilmer says starts his tweet blue day. Okay, but he spells the word
515520	525600	blue the way you spell blue in Blu Ray. BLU. Okay, or yeah, or he's from Belvive DeVoe.
533440	544320	Jeff was I'm not gonna shock anyone with this news. It's Super Bowl Sunday. Jeff came here
544320	552560	directly from the drawing room. It's been a it's been a long day. I'm drunk. Yeah. You made a face
552560	561440	like you're about to say I'm sober. Are you sober? Probably not. If I know me.
563680	570960	But this is a rare day where I'm relative to you. I'm like, Hey, whoa. Yeah, I'm not complaining.
570960	576800	I'm not complaining. Okay. You're about to No, no, no, I'm not complaining. I would never complain.
577440	582960	That would be instant karma so fast. I'm gonna be as drunk as you in the next 20 minutes. I'm just
582960	587520	tired. I'm just tired. All right. All right. This is this segment's gone way too long.
588880	592640	Read it read the tweet. Okay. Let's let's start from the top though. This
593200	596000	this segment's called Tis Tis Val Kilmer.
599440	609040	Naughty, naughty. Worst Batman. You know it. Not his fault. Just bad casting. That's weird casting.
609040	614400	And that's a George Clooney's been Batman. And even that was swallowable. Val Kilmer. Michael
614400	622640	Keaton. Michael Keaton. That's an interesting little groundswell of
625680	629040	what was it about Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman that that's defensible? Yeah,
629040	634240	his heart was in it. I don't know. He he he was he was he was the size of an actual bat.
635760	640640	But he you felt like he was like, Yeah, fuck you. Michael Keaton as Batman. And like you I don't
640640	645280	know. I felt like he he's the first guy to whisper Batman and you liked it because he like
645280	649280	he whispered it like it was good. And he's arguably the best thing. That was that was in
649280	654160	a rare time when Michael Keaton had a license to print money. He was in everything. He was Mr. Mom.
654160	659760	He was a gung ho. He was in every goddamn thing. He well, let's travel back in time to that day.
659760	664400	Like not not to the point where where you don't have to give him as much credit as we have to
664400	670080	give him like like he like Bruce Willis in Die Hard. He he he was he was he was Michael Keaton
670080	675920	was he wasn't coming off of Mr. Mom. He was it was it was weird when they announced that Michael
675920	680160	Keaton was going to be in a Batman suit. It was weird for everybody. But but but but all the Frank
680160	685840	Miller like like Diehards kind of went whatever Tim Burton wants like like this is they're making
685840	690960	a Batman. Did someone say no before Michael Keaton and somebody must have right. It was
690960	704240	Elizabeth Mastrantonio. For real. For real. Yeah a woman. This won't be one of our more
704240	711200	popular segments but it will be for it have the best mileage. It's becoming my favorite already.
712960	718960	This guy's iPhone went to sleep already. Now you got Tyler's gonna put his biometrics back into
718960	728640	it to start it up. Thank you. All right. So here we go. But Blue Day Philip Seymour Hoffman O.D. deed
730480	734320	not died O.D.D. O.D. apostrophe D. That's correct. All right.
736000	745440	Addiction comes from that's an abbreviation of from addiction comes from trying to escape the
745440	751360	pain of living. We all struggle with this but drugs capital D on drugs never help.
752480	758000	So that's a good 5 percent spent on the eternal soul of the man you supposedly respect. And
758000	763520	you know you know 95 percent what you've got to say about some fucking bullshit. And I just find
763520	768800	that within the span of the same tweet Val Kilmer I'm just telling you there's no rulebook for it.
768800	773680	But let me start to write it your chapter one. That's tacky. All right. So here we go.
778960	788240	Thank you for that was Val Kilmer. And hey you can redeem yourself Mr. Kilmer by coming on our show.
789840	791920	You can come down through the skylight if you like
792640	799040	and and and fight me with your your your sharp little wing. What's your weapons. What's your
799040	804320	beef with his Batman. No no no I don't really have one. Honestly I swear but he gave it his all too.
804320	810320	He's he's he's a he was a handsome man at that time. I don't know. I mean that that movie was
810320	815040	just a that was a bad bad experience for anyone to have to have if you were if you were alive back
815120	820160	then. It's just a bad thing to happen. I'm pretty sure everybody everybody here was.
821120	828880	But yeah. So it was just you know nobody here is 12. All right. So let's move on. We got over that
828880	835840	tragedy. But yeah. Oh I was. Yeah. I know guy was a good actor who was well deserving of public
835840	842240	mourning and and and and our respect. And I'm telling you I mean that guy is going to now
842240	846560	because we take we take these people for for granted national treasures. I would call them
846560	851600	go back and watch every movie that has Philip Seymour Hoffman in it. And now even it's not
851600	854640	like we didn't recognize the fact that he was a good actor. But holy shit he's going to be like
854640	860240	a legend. And it's a shame because he would have been so fucking good for the next 30 years.
860240	865600	It's terrible. He's 46 years old. Terrible terrible. Steve Martin tweeted today that he saw him do
866480	873040	Willie Loman and said that it was the best Willie Loman that he'd ever seen. He was that good. Like
873040	878400	he was a hell of a theater actor. I can't even begin to imagine seeing him live on stage. You
878400	887040	know what I can't begin to imagine Dan is a sports corner. Today is Super Bowl Sunday.
888000	893440	Dan I know that you saw the big game because you're a big lover of games big and small.
893440	897840	Yeah yeah I know I need to I need to keep up on all the sports with my seven plasma screens
897840	907600	in my sports bar. Sports corner. Sports corner get up your sports throw up your hands make you
907600	914000	sports worse. Gotta gotta get the ball outside. Gotta put it in the bounds wide. Sports corner
914000	919360	gotta do what you see. Gotta talk about sports know what I mean. I got injuries. Got athletic
919440	929360	yardage. Got all kinds of things. It's a sports corner. Dan Super Bowl just ended probably. What
929360	934000	a game. What a game. Who did you have favored going into the game before we talk about the
934000	938880	result. Well I think that all of us were rooting. We thought whether we were rooting for them or
938880	943120	not we thought this was a distinct situation of the home team having an advantage. Well
943120	950560	but they played in a neutral field in New York. Well and who's more neutral than you know who.
952320	956240	Okay well I mean I did I mean I do have to tell you that it was the Seattle Seahawks versus the
956240	961440	Denver Broncos. Yeah I don't even know we'll have to edit that out it's so redundant. Yeah exactly
961440	967440	but going in were you a Seahawks guy or a Broncos guy and tell me why. I mean we all thought for
967440	974960	look as a betting man. Yes. As a sportsologist. Just by the numbers. By the numbers. Strictly by
974960	984960	the numbers. As a blueprint sports man over my toast and jam. Getting gearing up for the day.
984960	988880	No matter what I'm hearing. And real quick real quick just tell me who the teams were again.
988880	995920	It was the Seahawks and the Broncos. Okay. And where are they from.
996640	1002240	They're from Seattle and Denver. Okay shit. I feel terrible for even asking. Yeah I mean again
1002240	1007760	again just edit it out. It doesn't matter. No no. Everyone knows what I'm telling you. So yeah we
1007760	1014880	all we all felt going in like like like because the robot part of us felt like it was going to
1014880	1021600	be a Seahawk game right. Yeah because. Well just because of the boring statistics Jeff the technical
1021600	1025600	things the things that don't have to do with the human heart yardage for instance. Like
1025760	1031840	Seahawks. What came into this game with a superior yardage and just more completions. Just like
1031840	1037200	there's just more completions. It seems on paper like better football. If you if you're a robot.
1038000	1045200	But if you look at it from a from a standpoint of injuries and and and and and recoveries.
1046320	1055280	Of those injuries. And March Madness. Which is a factor that nobody ever. Like like
1055280	1059360	because. Oh that's months off. People. March Madness isn't going to matter. Of course. People
1059360	1065760	forget to put March Madness in. Yeah. The Super Bowl equation. So that's you know. Okay. So what
1065760	1071120	we saw today was a fucking clash of the fucking Titans. Pardon my French. Were you were you
1071120	1079440	surprised by the result. I think we all were. Yeah. Were you. Of course I was. Yeah. And in what
1079440	1086480	way. Well I just I never thought I'd see so much steam coming off of the field. I was surprised
1086480	1091600	frankly by the lack of leadership on the Broncos part. That was that was a heartbreaker because
1091600	1098480	this is a team that's renowned for its quarterbackery. Everyone knows that the Seahawks they're
1098480	1104000	like a team of rogues. Okay. They move as one unit. They advance the ball. Okay. You're actually
1104000	1110480	kind of getting close to being accurate which is amazing. The Broncos have always been. It's
1110480	1123040	always been about one guy. Their quarterback. Let's stop interrupting me. And that guy. Peyton
1123040	1128320	Manning. I didn't see the same arm on Manning today. What was what did you see the difference
1128320	1135520	because I just I felt like something was wrong at home. This is a guy who's usually very
1135520	1143120	strategic. He sees a pocket and he delivers to it with no with no thought about the larger yardage.
1143120	1148800	This was a person who was he was about the amount of downs like he knew that this is a game of
1148800	1154400	downs. The more downs you get the more yardage you're gonna get. You're gonna get more down.
1154400	1158560	You thought there were too many thought pockets. Too many. He's just thinking too much about
1158560	1164640	yardage. Like I'm gonna make a big yardage pass instead of like who the old manning's Peyton's.
1164640	1170320	Yeah. Like he was a guy who would just shoot shoot shoot shoot break into little pockets
1170320	1175600	right in front of him. Okay. That's a third down. Congratulations. Now you got more downs.
1176960	1179600	You can trade those in for more points in the kickoff.
1179600	1195200	That's how you win Super Bowls. The Seahawks knew that. They learned that and they knew it.
1195200	1199680	They took they saw the weakness and they took advantage of it right on the 50 yard line. You
1199680	1204080	can see it. Did you make a bet in the game? Did you have any money? I put it all on the Hawks.
1204640	1211440	Yeah. What was it? What was the wager? You take the points in the money line. A gentleman doesn't
1211440	1217680	say but but but but I will say the spread was two to three. Took a two to three spread.
1219600	1224240	If you bet a lot on sports you know it's about the spread. Now I mean Dan you're a big you're
1224240	1229680	a big football guy. So now that the football season is officially over. Yeah but now March
1229680	1233600	Madness starts. Now you're Mr. March Madness. Who do you like in the brackets? Who do you got?
1234240	1236960	I think I think I think I'm gonna I'm gonna keep an eye on every bracket.
1238640	1243360	I think South Division is always the that's the we make the romantic notion it's gonna be
1243360	1249360	about South Division but we'll look at Northwest. Look what they did. Look at among among the top
1249360	1254400	ten. Look at the Eastern Seaboard. Among the top ten teams. Top ten teams. Who do you like?
1254400	1258400	Brackets Jeff. It's not about teams. It's about brackets of teams. But teams are
1258400	1263280	South. Teams exist with East Western. North. East Western. Eastern Seaboard. East Western.
1264000	1269760	East Western Division is you laugh but there's a after the wild card rule was removed from from
1269760	1275600	the uh from the brackets. The now East Western is going to be like one of the big powerhouses
1275600	1283040	coming out. You guys you guys laughed about Fox becoming a major network but East Western Division
1283040	1288720	is going to tear up the Astro. While we're on it who do you like in the Oscars? Best picture noms?
1289360	1293840	What do you like? You know best picture well you know people follow their hearts. I'm gonna go
1293840	1300960	Skippy Skippy's problem. Skippy's problem. Because you know I mean it's I don't I don't want to be
1300960	1306240	crass. I'm gonna get I'm gonna get in trouble for this tomorrow in the press but he's an alien with
1306240	1313200	AIDS. People are gonna go for that. That's gonna bring in every all the Transformers people and
1313200	1319760	all the AIDS people. And then and when you when you see when you see Harrelson's performance you're
1319760	1326240	gonna go like look good. Why is Harrelson? Look I love Harrelson as much as anybody. Why is he in
1326240	1334000	every movie now? Like how can he he's high. He loves getting high and making movies. What would you
1334000	1337040	he can do whatever he wants. What would you do? Did you see 12 Years a Slave? What do you think
1337040	1348400	about that? Yeah. No I didn't. I didn't see it. I thought about the concept of of riffing on that.
1349200	1354240	The joke being that I had seen it and I don't know. I saw I saw low dividends.
1356880	1362400	But you haven't seen it. I have not seen I haven't seen anything. I saw her. I saw her. I liked her.
1362480	1368160	Her was amazing. Her was good. Oh that's one for the ages yeah. I love that movie. Yeah I was not a
1368160	1372320	big Joaquin Phoenix fan but I liked that movie. I thought he was quite good in it. I think he's
1372320	1378400	great and I think that yeah I what I love about her is that like Eternal Sunshine it's it's these
1378400	1383040	it's these movies where you deconstruct love where you actually get to the heart of it. Like it's
1383040	1390080	it's like these movies where fucking like you know 19 pairs of shoes and three reasons to do it.
1390400	1395520	Like they they can be cute sometimes sometimes they can be good but they're they're never they're
1395520	1401040	never what was the log line on 19 pairs of shoes and three reasons to do it. Sometimes Mr. Right
1401040	1413680	can be right here. But those movies are sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad but they are
1413680	1417440	those movies and those movies never have anything to do with actual love because they because they
1417440	1422960	formulize love in an attempt to get their story done in a way that people because they devalue
1422960	1426480	the audience they don't think that the audience understands what love is and it's these movies
1426480	1431920	where somebody that's very lonely and very creative like says yeah but fuck love fuck love the way it
1431920	1436320	is in these movies and kind of deconstructs it that on the surface seems cynical but those are
1436320	1440080	the movies where you actually learn things about love while you're watching. I mean I felt myself
1440080	1446000	feeling things watching a movie about Joaquin Phoenix jerking off to his computer. It was it
1446080	1450720	was profound the things that they illustrated about the nature of relationships and the
1450720	1457760	definition of true love. And also yeah it's nice they removed the human body from the equation
1457760	1462320	which is an important thing to do if you're going to get to the bottom of real love. Because some
1462320	1468240	of you people got no legs. I've read about you. Stand up.
1468240	1479200	Hey Jeff can I tell you something I've always wanted to say up on this stage? You love cock
1479200	1492800	in your mouth? Real nice. I do not have that honor. Of being able to say that or? Of having a cock in
1492800	1499200	my mouth. Well I could if I want. You could. It's certainly within your bailiwick too. As mayor of
1499200	1517840	Armantown. All right. All right so. This segment. This segment is called. Before you tell me
1517840	1524160	give me shoot me for a musical theme. Like what. It doesn't matter. I mean you can pick one. The
1524160	1537600	segment is called. Seemingly unrelated paragraphs that I say into the microphone in a in a in a
1537600	1544000	confusing tense that make you think that I'm that I'm not here in the moment in this in this show.
1544000	1558800	I'm sorry say it again. Say I think I had the theme for it. I'm just I'm still I'm simultaneously
1558800	1571200	trying to memorize the. You just say play. I'm still thinking. I think I got it. You ready.
1571200	1577680	Okay. So the second it's called. Seemingly unrelated paragraphs that I've memorized and I'm
1577680	1596640	going to recite as if they're as if I'm making them up. Well Jeff. The thing about writing is
1597440	1605040	like the thing about writing is it's a it's a life spent throwing messages and bottles out into
1605040	1610320	this darkness. And you can see online or through Nielsen numbers that people are watching.
1610320	1615760	You can see in forums that people are respecting it. But what I'd like to do on I guess on this
1615760	1622000	tour now that I have no job is get out there and and and see if any of these people are real and
1622000	1628240	look into their eyes and find out if I've been having any impact. Did you get that. That's a wrap
1628240	1641360	on principal photography for the harmontown documentary. We're liars. Sometimes we lie.
1641360	1652320	Can I finish your movie. I said that on January 2nd 2012. I'd like to try it one more time and do
1652320	1660640	it more honest. Go ahead. What say. We didn't get it. Try it again. Okay. More honest. It's all alive.
1664160	1670080	More in the moment. Oh more in the moment. Okay. All right. I mean all right. How do we get you
1670080	1674640	in the moment. Well ask me about this topic. But you have to we have to change tenses. That's the
1674640	1682160	confusing thing. All right. Do it. Do it in the blue perfect. Is that Val Kilmer's blue perfect.
1682160	1687600	PLU dash perfect. Just go with it. Go with it.
1691520	1694480	I wasn't asking for a suggestion like an improv show for tense.
1694480	1703280	I was joking and saying doing it again. I thought you did it perfect the first time.
1703280	1711840	Okay. Well I mean the thing is the reason we write is because we want to connect with people. So you
1711840	1715920	sit and you put messages in bottles. You throw them into darkness at people that you don't know.
1716480	1720320	And then you see that they like it. But you see that in the form of numbers or on the internet.
1720320	1726160	And I just want it now that I'm in between jobs I thought we could go out there and go see if any
1726160	1734080	of these people were real. Did I have was there an impact there. That just seems so fucking fake.
1736240	1741840	Neil now I want you to get behind Dan and film an audience while Dan says it again. But I want the
1741840	1747840	audience to lie too. Pretend they haven't seen this before. Because now because if we're going
1747840	1751600	to use this and it's going to be in the documentary at least they all get to go. Oh we were in that
1751600	1756480	scene where we took that bullshit. We wrote that together. That's right. But I want you guys to
1756480	1762080	look either bummed out or blown away or whatever. But now Dan like you have to bring the thunder now.
1763760	1768960	It's like it's it's it's like you know when you're a writer the goal is to be racist. And
1771840	1777600	but I've never met a person that wasn't white. So I think the purpose of this tour is to get
1777680	1788800	out there on a team of horses and just find and touch and possibly interrogate non-caucasians.
1796560	1799280	Wow there's no end to the fallacy.
1799280	1811600	Neil thinks I'm making fun of the process but I'm not. I'm not. I mean it's a you know if you
1811600	1814960	try to make a documentary about me going on the road I don't I don't know why I'm going on the
1814960	1820960	road. That was like a little chunk that we thought maybe we could use. Did you get it Neil? You got
1820960	1827280	it. See you at Austin. See you at Berkeley. Yeah see you at South by Southwest. That's how you make
1827280	1832880	documentaries. Wait our documentary is already in the in the we're already in South by Southwest.
1832880	1837040	Yeah yeah he's still shooting it. We've been selected. That means that means that in the
1837040	1841520	trailer there will be like laurel leaves around a thing that says selected. On our little logo
1841520	1845920	there's laurel leaves but doesn't ours already have laurel leaves around it? Those are other
1845920	1853040	not that one but our Hermiton logo has laurels around it. Double laurels. We're resting on
1853120	1856160	other laurels. Interesting.
1860960	1865120	Anyways yeah I mean he probably won't use that because you can see when I'm being insincere
1865120	1871520	and I can't I can't I can't do it but I said it on the couch in there. Said what? Said the thing
1871520	1876480	about going on the road to touch people. Say it again. Say it again but really well while the
1876480	1884960	camera's not here because I'm going on the road to touch people. I'm getting I'm going to get into
1884960	1891280	a tour bus because I'm between jobs and I just want to go out there Jeff and I want to see if
1891280	1898160	there's faces behind the low Nielsen's and the affectionate tumbler blogs that I can touch
1899040	1901120	provided their age is above a certain limit
1903120	1907840	and make eye contact with and say uh am I a good person even though I'm fired?
1909120	1913840	It's a terrible reason to go on a tour and I don't think it's accurate. Was there ever a reason or do
1913840	1919600	you know the reason for real? No it was it could be it was just for fun right? I think well I think
1919840	1928960	I think the reason I for the tour is was it's not usable but the reason for the tour was uh
1929520	1937200	Neil get out of here. The reason for the tour was uh was to uh it had something to do with me the
1937200	1941120	performer because because I had just been fired as the writer so I was just I was just kind of
1941120	1946320	going like well I don't know am I I just wanted to dive into something that was different you know
1946320	1950160	that's all I don't know I don't know what goes what what beyond that the documentary does a pretty
1950160	1956160	good job of revealing uh I felt like it was a gross weird balloon animal of a person I am.
1956160	1962000	I felt like at a real simple level the idea was that you'd left the comfort zone of this room
1962000	1967760	and I wondered if you could find this kind of comfort level in Phoenix yeah in Brooklyn
1967760	1977040	whenever and strangely we found it because uh the audience is not any different wherever you go.
1977600	1982880	Yep and did it make you happier at the end did it change you in any way? Nope.
1984960	1990720	Not at all it made you happy you yeah it made me happy donuts make me happy I don't know if
1990720	1995120	they're good for me or not I don't know if I should deny myself them or or or devour them
1995120	2000480	for breakfast I yeah it made me happy going on tour I don't I don't I don't I think that I am a
2001840	2007920	I think that I am I am I am a I will always be an incomplete person I hope so because if you die a
2007920	2012400	complete person then that means you wasted some seconds of your life it would be nice to bring
2012400	2018000	it right into the station complete die but uh other than that your life should be spent kind
2018000	2025760	of completing yourself I uh I I so I did not get completed by the tour I didn't turn into somebody
2025760	2030000	else I didn't suddenly realize halfway through that I should be a vegetarian or that I should
2030000	2038960	quit drinking or that I should value the sunset I I I think I overcame my stage fright maybe by
2038960	2043920	orders of five to ten percent more and I and I think I also realized that it's too late for me
2043920	2049440	in terms of character arc as a character so I guys my age aren't characters on tv they're
2049440	2056240	usually detectives or surgeons they're supposed to have their shit figured out uh and and and so
2056240	2062560	that's why it was nice to like go on the road with Spencer who was still is young enough to
2063200	2070160	to be affected by old people and I like you know it was nice getting to know him and hearing a
2070160	2077280	little bit of him and me and and and and putting a little bit of me into him and uh and coming
2077280	2084560	back can you elaborate on that and and coming back with him and I I hired Spencer as my assistant
2084560	2091440	and I I started that animated show with Spencer and I I'm not shoving Spencer into into the system
2091440	2096000	but I'm putting him out there and he we ended up writing a character for him on community and
2096000	2100640	everything continues to be unflappable to him does he deserve it will it make him a good person
2100640	2107280	who cares but but uh he he's a he's a person too that's now kind of he can be out there I take
2107280	2113200	pleasure in that and it's like like I don't I don't get to I don't get to I don't get to change
2113200	2120240	fucking old dude but there was a moment when uh when you got back on community when they when
2120240	2125440	they rehired you you came back here and you had your arms crossed and you you sat down and you
2125760	2131840	you seemed very like poised and like vindicated uh you did change in that moment like there was a
2131840	2139360	vindication there and like wouldn't that be a change yeah I'm I'm yeah but but then that's
2139360	2143760	short lived right like then all of a sudden you're back at the dirty work of yeah the same companies
2143760	2147280	that will fire you because they don't give a shit about you will also rehire you because they don't
2147280	2152240	give a shit about you like they they they you shouldn't take it as seriously as you do but I'm
2152240	2155520	gonna keep doing could you answer honestly I mean could you could you even know the answer this
2155520	2160640	question would you rather uh there was another season of community or would you rather there
2160640	2167760	not be one uh a sixth season yeah no I I'm not I can't answer that question because I I have to I
2167760	2171680	have to actively I think we've already talked about this those are very strange thing for me
2171680	2176960	I have to actively hope for a sixth season otherwise like I wouldn't wouldn't be able to
2176960	2180000	go to work there but if you knew there was going to be a sixth season would that instantly make you
2180000	2187200	happy or that make you bummed out or like worried I mean I wouldn't it's it's more it's more complex
2187200	2191360	than that it's like it's like it's like knowing that you have a baby on the way like does that
2191360	2196080	I mean there's different parts of you that would be like fuck am I ready for this shit I could have
2196080	2208240	used uh that trip to the Everglades come on we've all been there it's that fantasy of having a kid
2208320	2214480	but you also want to go on one of those fan boats but I said and what could be more mutually
2214480	2224320	exclusive but knowing you for a long time like so you say gators is sex is determined by the
2224320	2230640	temperature that's right keep your baby's blanket out of the fan please
2230960	2238080	you never see that it's dangerous either pro creator explore american swamplands
2239120	2243920	do not try both but it's hard like knowing you for a long time it's hard to say whether you are
2243920	2248960	you're a happy version of you or a sad version you you you always come off like you like you're
2248960	2252880	incomplete that there's a sadness to you but I would say right now knowing you that you're
2252880	2258560	probably as happy as you've been since I've known you definitely yeah but but you yeah but you you
2258560	2263520	don't wear a smile like you're not you're not you're not you don't do bell kicks down the road
2263520	2272560	my my whole life is a smile he said frowningly the the the part you get to look at is the little
2272560	2279760	center part of the smile that's the little kissy part fucking corners of my life are up by my
2280560	2287600	up by god's ears I'm part of god I'm god's mouth I am god's mouth and I am smiling
2288560	2299360	but but but the part you get to see for 40 years is a wrinkly little snot gutter with gross
2299360	2306000	mustache hair on it you'd never tell if it's smiling it's yeah but yeah I like that metaphor
2306000	2314400	I'm gonna refine it and blog about it but uh no yeah definitely look I I uh uh uh yeah no because
2314400	2320240	I I've got a lot of stuff like uh I'm always way happier if there's stuff out there that people
2320240	2324640	are experiencing that can somehow I can convince myself reflects on my value as a person
2324640	2330240	well simultaneously knowing that it doesn't but uh I'm way happier having something on the air
2330240	2334880	than not having something on the air if they were to say hey we need to see six seasons of community
2334880	2340160	I'm going to be just as happy as if they say community is cancelled exactly as happy for
2340160	2346640	totally different reasons because it's a it's a completely uh I I'm fulfilled I get to do whatever
2346640	2354160	I want I get to I have a fucking giant baby just like a big pacifier in my mouth and um now I'm
2354160	2360400	getting married to somebody that's heard me fart and I got a dog and it's all it's it does it like
2360400	2365120	I'm not I'm not tap dancing every day I still got a lot of shit to do but but uh yeah you're right
2365120	2376240	I'm happy why are you applauding happiness that's the one thing that doesn't need applaud world
2376240	2381920	hunger oh wait don't do that no don't do that wait that's bad okay I know no I know I retract
2381920	2384800	my question that's why you're applauding it you want to reward it because you want more happiness
2384800	2388080	they're applauding happiness but it's so funny because when you say you're happy you you you
2388080	2392400	make an excruciating face I was I was I was thinking about their applause it was like why
2392560	2396480	why do we applaud people saying they're happy but you frown before the applause you were saying
2398880	2404080	when I talk I'm a thoughtful person of a no but you don't frown all the time you frown more more
2404080	2410960	when you like more tonight when you said that you're happy and content that that that looks
2410960	2415120	miserable because it's not a natural a happy person's natural state is not talking about how
2415120	2419600	happy they are why they're happy that's not a natural state so it takes me out of the happy
2419600	2425280	moment to to to count the reasons why I'm happy that's something that dishonest people do oh I
2425280	2431360	love I love Todd so much he and I he did the he did the most sweet thing the other day he and I
2431360	2437760	we went rock climbing because that's how we met and he pulled out a tiny rock the same shape as
2438400	2443200	and just blah blah blah blah blah press release about how complete you are as a couple fuck off
2443280	2448800	like I'm so I'm so I'm so amazed I went to Griffith Park today and I I went jogging I
2448800	2455200	just fucking blew out my quads and my delts and I feel fucking good I feel so good I'm so I'm
2455200	2461120	really at a complete place in my life I don't believe you like I I'm I'm I'm I'm frowning when
2461120	2465840	I talk about whether I'm happy or not because that talks about that well that sounds like you
2465840	2470400	don't like yeah you're right about that but I feel like it's a part of you is that you don't
2470400	2475120	feel like you're allowed to be happy like you're getting away with something like you're I don't
2475120	2482080	think I'm allowed to say it I think I think that I think that I think that frowning and scowling
2482080	2488400	and but if somebody asks you are you happy you're allowed to say yes secretly it's privately a little
2488400	2494320	more privately than I don't think it makes for a good speech like Hitler didn't say I'm happy he
2494320	2503360	wasn't happy but he got so much done oh boy we we may actually have to edit that out
2505280	2506880	that just that just came together
2510560	2513440	I'm so used to using Hitler as a way to make a point
2515360	2518080	I accidentally used him to make a point about happiness
2518080	2522720	because I don't normally talk about how to be happy
2524560	2530400	usually grabbing the Hitler tool out of the out of the toolbox works but I was I was feeding a baby
2531600	2535040	I grabbed that Hitler oh no I'm feeding a baby with a head right now you're
2535840	2539040	you're smiling more talking about Hitler than you did about your own happiness
2541120	2544560	look at the smile on your face this guy loves Hitler
2544800	2547760	you hate yourself
2549200	2553840	I'm smiling because it's fun to make mistakes their reaction is fun we're laughing together
2553840	2558160	and then the the odd thing is you know there's so many things that we've talked about on this stage
2558160	2562080	where everybody's been smiling and happy and feeling free and like nothing's wrong
2562080	2566960	and then there's the context issue so then like like here's a here's a recording here's
2566960	2571760	a transcript of Dan Harmon talking about his feelings about work and it's like it's all fun
2571760	2575120	otherwise I wouldn't say it up here trying to make people laugh I'm trying to make people
2575120	2578640	think trying to make trying to try to make people happy that they spent ten dollars on something
2578640	2583440	I'm not going to and then it's like and I oh I tend to go to the places where these people
2583440	2588320	are like happy and everyone's smiling and interested or whatever uh but then there's
2588320	2593280	a global context now it's also fucked up and stupid yeah but fuck that shit like this you're
2593280	2597200	a lot of shit from the hips still you're never going to stop doing that I'm I'm always going
2597200	2602240	to do that but I don't want to talk about it that anymore and I also don't want to talk about
2602240	2607440	whether or not I'm happy like it's some kind of press release that's it I mean I understand
2607440	2611280	but that's a silly thing like Catherine Hepburn was like in some interview I want to say it was
2611280	2615600	Dick Cavett maybe it was maybe it wasn't and there was a leading question kind of like do
2615600	2620320	you like Hollywood do you like Hollywood people and she says like the best people I've ever known
2620320	2625040	lived in Hollywood like I love being an actress I love like I know you want me to say that I like
2625040	2629120	like fuck Hollywood and they're phonies it was like the greatest people in the world live in this
2629120	2635600	town like I I'm surrounded by creative people and she can say that but but she knows when she says
2635600	2643360	that that you sound like that's a very um it's an identifiable thing to say out loud as he just
2643360	2648560	scatters the stage with ice you're allowed to be happy you're allowed to brag about it but you
2649600	2653600	you're never going to boast about your happiness but you're allowed to you know kind of smile and
2653600	2660800	chuckle at your own well-being right now well I think that when you're I don't know about you
2660800	2667040	well I do know about you you're weird like uh but I know that Dino and I because I've talked to him
2667040	2675840	about this when we're really happy we get in our car and we play like really fucked up melancholy
2675840	2684880	music like if I find out that I've been nominated for an Emmy and I have no not not recently sorry
2685680	2690720	that wasn't an announcement I was just I'm saying I know I'm saying like like these experiences
2690720	2697360	where it's like in a biopic you're supposed to simply just go like huh like it it it it's more
2697360	2702160	when it happens in real life when you go like like I just won this thing or I I just achieved this
2702240	2707040	thing or that thing I was working on really hard it's getting picked up and it's gonna go and it's
2707040	2712880	gonna you got you gotta pray with I tend to just like I seek isolation in those moments and
2712880	2717200	melancholy well so do I it has something to do with like the same fact that the way we appreciate
2717200	2723840	food is we destroy it we'd shit it out like we our saliva has enzymes in it that break a thing
2723840	2729440	down so that we can use it in a real way and I I love nothing more if I'm having a really
2730000	2737440	good professional time like I love to celebrate it quietly and but with a drink staring out a
2737440	2744240	window at a at a michael man los angeles skyline and play something really synthy and sad and
2744240	2750320	heroin sounding and and kind of like and definitely not smile really if you have a camera panned
2750320	2754400	around me the director might go come on give me a little you just got nominated for an Emmy
2754800	2760240	no this is what it looks like it looks like fucking like yeah whoever would have thought
2760240	2767120	you know you just sort of like slump into it I'm happy so much and I'm always just doing that
2767120	2771200	that's good to hear because if I was like if I was waiting tables if I was lifting crates
2771200	2776160	and stuff and I've had those jobs not crates but uh but but like yeah you come home and then you
2776160	2782800	go right for the uh you you you grab a beer and you chug it down and you call a friend and you're
2782880	2788160	like wow let's have some fun that might be aged too like I haven't done that stuff since that age
2788160	2794000	but I have a feeling that like working a 12-hour shift at an emergency room makes you want to go
2794000	2807600	out and smile a lot excuse me uh but like if you if you get if you get paid to be in your pajamas
2807680	2812720	for four months of the year and then and then drink starbucks and talk about how to make people
2812720	2818320	laugh for the other part of the year like and then if also people tell you that you're doing it well
2819440	2822880	I don't know I don't know how often you'd smile because what's the point
2826560	2830400	yeah I think of the times when I felt like when I was really at my lowest
2830400	2836000	and uh like when I was really broke and being evicted and like like things started finally
2836000	2840960	happening for me like with work like you you don't you don't run out and smile and like call
2840960	2846560	your friends and celebrate you you sit in the corner in the dark and uh cry like like that
2846560	2850880	that some of the happiest moments I've ever had was being completely alone and just like crumpled
2850880	2856720	into a heap but you just said back of those days when both you and I were broke you were being
2856720	2864800	evicted and all that stuff we to to correct you on that or or clarify we when we would go out we
2864800	2870000	were we were laughing all the time yeah and then I'm saying that the first moment when the
2870000	2875360	moment the first moment of safety when when the phone call came in that a job came in when you
2875360	2880640	were going to be on a show or like work came in you don't go like whoa like like like like it's
2880640	2887040	in the way that you use it yeah my knees gave out a couple of times and you just lay on the floor
2887040	2890800	and oh yeah that's what you're talking about those moments and you put on sad music then later on
2890800	2895200	when you recover I I called up you and you and I would go out there and then we would sit there
2895200	2900800	and giggle at our fortune because you and I were paying each other's bills for for a couple years
2900800	2907280	like we were surviving off of each other's alternate good fortune uh there there were
2907280	2913200	times when you and I I've never seen you or I laugh as much uh but I agree with you in those
2913200	2918960	moments when when like when you really like happy alone it's not you're not Gene Kelly you know
2918960	2924400	dancing down the street you're you're in the corner or in your car you know like being west
2924400	2933280	full and melancholy yeah yeah and who's crankier than I don't know rich people getting what they
2933280	2937680	want like like they're not because they're never really experiencing like genuine reasons to be
2937680	2943440	happy like I like getting a candy bar when you're starving that's like a big deal getting getting
2943440	2950560	getting a really good Kobe steak when you can have anything you want to eat like people tend
2950560	2956240	to go like it was a little it was a little undercooked like you you still you enjoy the steak
2956240	2962560	but the way you express it is with a foodie blog where you complain you nitpick whereas the person
2962560	2968560	who is starving and you hand them a fucking Snickers bar they would like kiss it and like
2969120	2977200	break into tongues so fucking hungry I've been I've been lost in the snow wolves are eating me
2977200	2984640	and I found toothpaste I'm gonna eat it happiness is like it's not always an expression of of of
2984640	2989120	like satisfaction it's an expression of like going from one extreme to the other it's like
2989120	2996560	that portamento is that what they call it slide whistle you know going sliding from one thing to
2996560	3000800	the other with your well your fingers are on the frets all right that's our music segment uh

3402640	3413360	weddings are different you're doing a red wedding um spoilers uh someone said nice uh yeah i don't
3413360	3419760	i wonder if anybody has that for sure there's been a red wedding like like like like two huge game
3419840	3425280	of thrones fans have yeah have fell in love fallen in love and gotten married and have
3425280	3431120	and have had like a at least on some scale sir have had some kind of red wedding like
3431120	3436000	gag and there's some there's there's there's a hilda at the wedding who like has to be splashed
3436000	3441440	by blood but it needs to be a good sport and everyone's giving a hmm you know i'm like when
3441440	3445440	i talk about blood so badly i was up without spoiling the wedding are you guys doing high
3445440	3450160	concept shit because aaron you like when you throw parties they they tend towards the high
3450160	3461520	concept yeah spectrum but i but i will i i i would like my wedding to be as a good ceremony should
3462560	3469360	it will be a narrative event there will be a story told you will you will feel like you're
3469360	3474400	a part of something that's more than just the standard story of let's get dressed up let's go
3474400	3481040	to the wedding okay that was a wedding uh zero it will be a there will be a concept in that regard
3481040	3486160	what will the call to adventure be however i well none of that i can't i'm not gonna i mean they're
3486160	3491600	talking about a thing that happens a year from now but i but also in keeping with my personal
3491600	3496080	philosophies of entertainment the people that come to the wedding they have to not be put upon by
3496080	3501680	the concept they have to just be like swept up in it and they could just have a good time regardless
3502080	3507200	yeah and you notice that dan keeps on saying my wedding that's because we're having two separate
3507200	3514880	weddings i i will be marrying the idea of dan and then he'll be the idea of me
3516320	3518240	we'll tell each other about it afterwards
3520320	3521760	mine will be in a pool of blood
3524080	3527360	yeah it's gonna be great there's gonna be a good story we're writing the story together it's all
3528320	3528640	fun yeah
3532000	3535600	i like it we're good collaborators we don't we don't we don't get on each other
3535600	3541120	yeah we're like doing stuff together i still really want us to write a uh sci-fi rom-com
3544480	3548880	for the wedding or just just like for a thing just in general because dan and i have had several
3548880	3556800	like joke arguments about the two uh genres and combining the two that's all yeah it's not a
3556800	3563600	fruitful or pathway to go down the big bummer about our relationship is that our shared love
3563600	3573280	is sitting and eating and watching movies and uh but there's a distinct breakdown and the types
3573280	3582720	of movies we would like to watch and i really i really liked clueless i did i thought it was
3582720	3589760	uplifting and interesting and i really i liked 27 dresses i really did 27 dresses i thought it
3589760	3597840	was charming and and sweet uh and we both liked her because that's a sci-fi sci-fi romantic comedy
3597840	3603040	but but but other than that we're fucked and it's just and it's just like she does like we really
3603040	3608640	say mean things not about each other but just like we just get mean i just go like okay yeah
3608720	3616480	why don't you just type in uh you know paul rudd uh gets his groove back and i'll just focus on my
3616480	3621600	farming game on my ipad and then she's like well what if paul rudd explodes and someone has to jump
3621600	3628320	away in slow motion and then we you know we get we get we get you know like like like like erin's
3628320	3636000	erin's thing is that she observed the fact that i honestly do not care if the acting the directing
3636080	3641840	even the writing if it's kind of bad as long as the things that are happening in the movie
3641840	3650400	have something to do with robots right dinosaurs zombies explosions spaceships some anything really
3650400	3656720	though like like like like something like happening i need a threshold to be crossed
3656720	3663280	other than like oh my god i have to i have to help my boss meet my sister
3663280	3671840	like that should be happening in the background of a real story where where someone's coffee cup
3671840	3677120	has a snake in it you know that like if it gets into your brain it knows what you think and
3678000	3686960	and can tell your friend what you think and then snakes start spreading through throughout what
3686960	3699680	what's that movie called decaf cobra no snakes on a brain snakes on a brain fuck you Adam snakes
3703440	3711440	what if there's a movie about two murderous androids i'm in i don't care what you say next i'm in
3711440	3718400	that's how easy i am but what if there is there is less violence but like the two androids are
3718400	3727120	are approaching each other in the uh in the the station just the station and uh like but they're
3727120	3732400	holding they're holding a bunch of cogs and bolts and stuff and they run into each other like oh no
3732400	3739120	that's mine no that's mine oh come on and then they have this like if spike joe's directs it i'm
3739520	3748000	i'm down i'll watch it i know you're i know you're trying to trick me i thought what you were
3748000	3752240	trying to do anyway was that you were gonna go what if there was a movie about about androids
3752240	3758160	that were so lifelike that the whole movie was just them running into each other and not liking
3758160	3762880	each other the whole and this takes place in the future when like androids have totally taken over
3762880	3767600	so everyone's an android and these two androids like one of them has 27 bridesmaids dresses and
3767600	3772320	the other ones i will i mean frequently like i'll say that's what she said she said it was
3772320	3776320	murderous androids but it's not really about violence it's more about them just workplace
3776320	3781520	drama but what i will do now because uh frequently dan will fall asleep and then that's the time when
3781520	3786320	i'll put on these shitty movies and he'll wake up and respond to something that's said in the movie
3786320	3789680	and it won't make any sense and he'll be angry that i'm watching the movie when you do that the
3789680	3794800	next time i'm going to tell you that ashen kutcher is an alien or something or a murderous robot and
3794880	3798640	then but you'll you'll enjoy it can we it'll probably make more sense because my girlfriend
3799520	3804640	she likes dramas like one hours and now we watch nashville together uh can we all come into my place
3804640	3811040	and watch fucking nashville this show is fucking nuts uh does anybody watch nashville i'm sad that
3811040	3816320	anybody here has that's the fucking worst my very good friendship is on it that this show
3817760	3823920	wow it's uh it's uh it's nothing is beneath the show and yet i i fall in love with it
3823920	3828960	also we have to watch the baby we watched the baby 1973 a film called the baby anybody
3829680	3835920	no uh fucking dig it uh it's a cult movie we watched it at shroud's place the other night uh
3835920	3841360	we we should all watch this movie and then come in and talk about it um the less said about it
3841360	3849200	beforehand the better but fucking 1973 the baby the baby it's uh a welfare worker goes to a family
3849200	3856800	that has raised a fully grown man as an infant and so these hot kind of fetishy chicks are
3856800	3863680	changing his diaper and he's 25 but he's a baby he's a baby and they take his diaper off and then
3863680	3869520	they fuck him at night and they chase him around the cattle prod and it's a very good movie uh
3869520	3878240	uh i just i i just conjured like this uh childhood memory i have of uh
3881440	3887440	going to my sister's hospital uh my sister was at uh ret syndrome at birth and she was at this
3887440	3898640	hospital and uh there was a lot of uh retarded people in the hospital and i remember uh visiting
3898640	3904320	her as a kid and not knowing she was my sister but like we were going to mister and then i i just
3904320	3909840	i always have this like i remember the smell you know i smell like like like if you like it's that
3909840	3914960	diaper smell like every time i smell it kind of like like i really get placed there and i remember
3914960	3920080	walking on this linoleum or these fluorescent lights i kind of wandering off while people took
3920080	3926240	pictures with my sister and uh wandering down this linoleum hallway and following the sound of this
3926320	3935520	this weird sound of this this person going momo momo and uh and then i walked into this room and
3935520	3942000	there was this crib and there was rows of cribs and there were adults in all of them
3942640	3948080	and i looked into there was a team of like nurses around the one there the sound was coming from
3948080	3953680	and it was this guy he didn't have down syndrome he was just you know there's a lot of ways to be
3954320	3962240	developmentally uh disabled and uh this guy's just looked like a porn star he just looked like a guy
3962240	3966480	he just looked like he looked like a porn star because he was naked he looked like he looked
3966480	3972480	like he had a mustache a finely groomed 70s mustache and he had like a hot comb side parted
3972480	3977120	haircut like it just like he would just be a guy that worked where my dad worked but he was in a
3977120	3984320	diaper and uh and he was going moo moo moo moo and then they finally gave him his moo moo which
3984320	3990800	was like this squeaky cow toy and i was just this kid i could i was just just wandering in
3990800	3997360	and seeing this it was i don't know if it was traumatizing because i don't when i when i think
3997360	4002000	about it it was for all of us i'm upset because you just spoiled the plot of our wedding
4002320	4009440	um all the groupsmen were gonna be in the little crips and steve ad was gonna wait a little stuck
4009440	4014400	with me i mean i think i i think it was kind of a sandbaggy way to expose a kid to uh
4014400	4019920	institutionalized mental health yeah like that was not what i maybe needed to see if i was going
4019920	4025600	to grow up to believe in therapy i don't know i'm gonna i'm not gonna i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
4025600	4031600	blame blame that on i don't know i think therapists are also stupid we should not we should not forget
4031600	4041360	that but also i just think of this guy this diaper i was like like i don't know i felt like
4041360	4046400	i was like i was like what that guy looks like my dad like why does he why does he want his moo moo
4046400	4051040	and and why are they treating him like a baby i mean he's well he can't he's like in a crib
4051760	4058080	it's weird he was like 35 so how soon do you want to watch this movie this baby movie
4058800	4065520	i don't know if you if you had a interesting thing about that memory is i i haven't bought
4065520	4070800	i haven't consumed it with my ego-driven uh mythologization of memories you know the way
4070800	4076880	we do that we're like then my mom said this and then i said that that's why i'm so into purple
4076880	4082480	you know and then and then once you've decided that like you kind of like you then you refine
4082480	4086800	it and you're like oh well let's shore up these edges that kind of contradict the fact that this
4086800	4093120	is why i like purple let's make my mom really into red and uh the that memory is so distinct
4093120	4097840	but i haven't co-opted it in any way that i know of because i don't know how to feel about it it's
4097840	4105680	just so distinct just like i could i could i could draw every tile of that linoleum floor i could i
4105680	4113840	could i could create every every smell if i if i knew how to create smells i know you i know what
4113840	4123120	you're gonna say we both know there's no need to say it if you had a mumu like if you let's say
4123120	4127920	but like something something happened where you you witnessed something really tragic all of a
4127920	4134000	sudden and you had a psychotic break and you were sent to a place like this and you you reverted
4134000	4138720	back to infancy infancy what would be your mumu what would be the thing that you were calling for
4138720	4150560	all the time but that's different that's not the same it's not like he cradles a vodka bottle at
4150560	4159520	night so well it would be the comfort item well the sad thing is it would just be like iphone yeah
4160320	4166640	fofo fofo ring ring ring ring ring yeah i don't know it'd be a picture of you i'm sure
4172560	4176320	let's get spencer out shall we spencer
4176640	4191200	hey guys i i think probably everyone has already forgot this but uh when i was on the
4191200	4197600	academic decathlon team in high school my i wanted to make the name of our team snakes on a brain
4198560	4203360	for real yeah no one remembers wait that that's how how recently you were in high school
4203680	4210960	yes snakes on a plane wasn't theaters i think it had just came out yeah wow wow that's fucking
4210960	4221760	shocking everyone shut up how old are you spencer i'm 24 24 24 what are you trying to
4222400	4230880	yeah i'm just casting my mind back to 24 24 24 i think i worked i was just i was a drag character
4230880	4238880	at disneyland in a sketch show i was dressing up as a woman for disney yeah yeah we wrote these
4238880	4244480	sketches for disneyland i think they still do them in frontier land and uh yeah i had to put
4244480	4250000	on i was sally may the ugly uh ugly daughter of the mayor of frontier land no that wasn't fair
4250000	4254800	i'm sure you're very well also we we were i played the mayor and the sheriff too but i frequently
4254800	4261360	would uh dress up in a big gingham dress and a bit curly q wig and uh we were the only uh
4262240	4266160	the only character is allowed to have uh men that could have facial hair like stubble
4266880	4272000	because if we were unshaven it was funnier because if we were women and the joke was that
4272000	4278320	we were ugly uh it was like we had to be really ugly like and when women played that character
4278320	4283840	not cool because the joke was that she was ugly so it was funnier if like six foot four guys with
4283840	4291920	stubble played the gown i was in a melodrama uh play like a um the uh gosh what's the the
4291920	4297760	dudley duray type production when i like a cola like in this in powey california which has kind
4297760	4305840	of a western western history are you from powey oh wow cool um sorry i just have a lot of feelings
4305840	4310640	about powey uh so i i was in this production and i i was i was like the i was the female
4311280	4318000	lead and i had the like a big blonde wig and a ton of makeup and uh that like a gingham dress
4318000	4322080	and all that and and i thought i looked really pretty and i have a bunch of pics like i took
4322080	4326400	way too many pictures of myself during this time and the male lead was my boyfriend at the time
4326400	4329760	and i thought it was the best thing ever invited everyone i knew to it even though it was the
4329760	4334880	shittiest thing in the world and uh opening night one of one of the things i had to do was like go
4334880	4339920	into the front row and like sit on the lap of some man and it would make the uh dudley duray
4339920	4344640	character jealous and i sat on the lap of a man and i heard him say to his friend like get this
4344640	4351120	guy off me because i thought they thought i was and i was wearing so much makeup uh that they
4351120	4358320	thought i was in drag which i basically was i was in drag i was like looking was trying to look like
4358320	4366960	a really va va va voom woman but boy was that a bummer damn it what does he need his friend to
4366960	4373520	help him get a guy off him i can't imagine myself ever saying that jeff get this guy off me
4375920	4381360	maybe maybe he was worried his friend thought he was gay and that he was he was in the closet and
4381360	4385760	he was subconscious no that's actually that's really interesting yeah in the moment he was
4385760	4389360	like that's what he wanted because he knew the words that came out of his mouth couldn't be
4389360	4393280	i'm not i'm not into this yeah to his friend and if he would have thought i was a woman he would
4393360	4397760	have said i'm gonna fuck her later yeah really aggressively stand on me because she wants it
4397760	4403040	yeah and i want it to i want it so bad i really do i promise i'm gonna get it in her so far in

4430960	4438880	i was a bandit or i was this sally may character and uh snow white or cinderella or ariel or
4438880	4443360	esmeralda like all the disney princesses would be in their underwear walking about with their hair

4449840	4454080	and uh like ariel's they had a little rack of clams they called clam shell bras but like
4454640	4457840	and like that's like one one set of clams is way bigger than the other ones and her name was
4457840	4464560	stephanie i remember i was like whose clams are those i said she's new she's definitely
4465360	4470000	she has giant clams she hasn't figured out how to use the clams it's like demolition man

4520400	4528560	jeffrey brian davis please insert this feather oh here's your free ostrich leg so anyway there
4528560	4534320	was a gal that played Pocahontas for a while at disney land and she was let's just say the hottest
4534320	4539120	thing on the planet earth she was like more dads took photos with this Pocahontas than children
4540480	4547680	she was just like kablamo uh as warren thomas would say she she came from the planet puneni
4547680	4553760	and uh she was just like wow we and and the Pocahontas outfit is a bit scant like it's uh
4553760	4561280	it's it's revealing and she was very sweet and young a orange county girl and she came into
4561280	4564960	our dressing room my dressing room was me and two other guys that were in the sketch comedy trip and
4564960	4569920	one of us ultimately would be the mayor the sheriff or sally may the ugly daughter of the
4569920	4574320	mayor of frontier so we've been there it's always hot because it's you know summertime in uh in
4574400	4582400	california and Pocahontas came in just to say hi and she left and my friend joe uh who is in the
4582400	4588080	in the cast and he's gay and he's very sweet he uh Pocahontas left and he just went into song
4588080	4592800	and i'll never fucking forget this and this is really bad but i repeat this for no reason
4594480	4598400	the song was because she just left and we kind of just left in her wake of like
4598400	4607120	oh and he went there once was an indian maid who said she wasn't afraid to lie on her back
4607120	4612480	in the old bear shack and let the cowboys tickle her crack but one day to her surprise
4612480	4618000	her belly began to rise and up from her conjured a little red runt with his ass between his eyes
4618000	4629360	disneyland you know that song would have made the the the gender issues episode so much more fun
4630960	4639120	why was the child deformed would we can start the questions right now i've known i i have
4639120	4646240	30 i i don't know why why i would say it's the most inflammatory racist thing i've ever heard
4646240	4652880	of my life and uh it was uh the fact that it was sung backstage at a disney Disneyland dressing
4652880	4657280	room made it all the more sweet something to do with the fact that she made love by letting them
4657280	4662880	tickle her crack that's so he had an ass between his eyes because that was his identity she said
4662880	4666960	she wasn't afraid to lie on her back in the old bear shack i uh first my question is what's the
4666960	4674240	bear shack i figure that's just where you cure your pelts and it's where you it's a place that
4674240	4679200	you think is bill knows what i'm talking about all right beef beef i'm sorry beef beef beef god
4679200	4685360	beef steak beef god just bill oh he's a beef god well you know he's he's graduated he took his abuse
4685360	4692640	one day had just been built he's galvatron now uh but no you see you're you're you're a you're a
4692640	4700160	wood a woodsman in a you have to cure you like cure you gotta cure hides and stuff what would you
4700160	4706960	say a bear shack was would you if you were an indian may be afraid to lie in your back in the
4706960	4711200	old bear shack and let the cowboys take all your crack not if i was to look behind us not if you
4711200	4713680	or if you thought that they were going to kill you if you didn't let them do it
4715680	4719600	yeah okay i'm just kidding but i like the reaction i got
4721280	4723440	yeah the song has troubled me for a long time
4723680	4731280	um i'll reverse the sexism when i was uh when i was in college me and my uh me and a friend
4731280	4736880	of mine would go to the local mall and uh walk outside of the amber crumbie and fitch where the
4736880	4748160	male models were and just laugh did you sing a song about them no i mean uh there once was a
4748160	4754960	guy named tod who had a giant rod he took off his shirt and uh sat in the dirt and got a job at
4754960	4761360	amber crumbie and fitch it wasn't a popular song that's the first time it's ever been sung
4761360	4769040	so are you sure rhymes came yeah yeah yeah it's uh it's a it's ab abc4 that's a sign of yeah
4769840	4775760	spencer do you know any ripple nursery rhymes or or tunes that's a weird line to bring me in on i'm
4775760	4780080	sure there's a lot of rhymes about you because when you were born isn't it true that your balls
4780080	4786000	were bigger than uh your heart than adults yeah but the problem with that is uh okay so it's like
4786000	4795120	spencer was born his balls as big as oranges then you stop you can't go any further nothing rhymes
4795120	4798480	were your balls as big as oranges didn't you see your balls were as big as the human hearts or
4798480	4804080	something like that before i'm sure yeah that's i think my dad said that have your balls mellowed
4804080	4808560	out to a more regular size and they stayed are your balls still as big as oranges right well i
4808560	4815040	mean most of the time they're down there just normal size but they can occasionally uh assume
4815040	4825280	orange yeah they get they engorge and grow fur jesus christ really yeah really on the full moon
4825280	4836400	yeah he has like can't throw penis no testicles that was close
4838720	4843360	no i'm just trying to think is it where werewolf is where the where the the where part is actually
4843360	4848560	the man part but we often make the mistake of going oh i'm like a wear soda i turn into a soda
4848560	4851440	no that's no that would be right yeah right
4854960	4858080	if you said i was a soda wolf that'd be more suspect
4860480	4866080	wear soda i mean nothing bad happens but it's dangerous depending on where i am
4871120	4876240	remember connor remember connor's conundrums shit wow what ever happened to that kid you
4876240	4881040	think he like went basketball diaries on us after we stopped using his conundrum someone
4881040	4889600	tried to rob him and he said would you rather keep robbing me or have a wing on your butt
4890880	4894480	the person was like that's a terrible conundrum and he's like that's what harvard toad said
4896160	4902320	he just ran off into the night now he's under a bridge warming his hands over a coffee can
4902320	4911600	in next to some guy named duke a nice guy a guy who's seen the ropes under that bridge
4911600	4916800	to telling him about all the other people that over there is rosie you don't want to talk to her
4916800	4922080	about her baby he doesn't know the ropes but he's seen them
4924720	4929200	he doesn't know the ropes of non-homelessness is that what you mean he said he's a guy that
4929360	4933840	under the bridge and has seen the rope oh he's seen the rope okay sorry it's a rope i told you
4933840	4940640	i'd get as drunk as you before the all right so let's uh yeah let's uh what do you think about
4940640	4946000	dungeons and dragons do you like playing it or do you hate it i i enjoy it i like playing magic the
4946000	4952320	gathering a bit more that's surprising reaction i've never played that briefly described to me
4952320	4957200	okay so the merits of you know how in dnd you fight but most of the time you fight with swords
4957200	4962160	like if you're a wizard you'd be fighting with spells so the the point is your wizards that are
4962160	4966720	using spells to kill each other and the spells might be oh i summon a goat or it might be i
4966720	4972640	shoot fire at your face so basically that and you strategy based they're just the two
4973600	4978160	just goats and lightning bolts i don't like it you know what i like about dnd i don't know if you've
4978160	4986320	noticed is the yelling i like getting in verbal fights you like getting inflamed for no reason
4986320	4993760	yeah no reason yes yeah sure so sometimes i'll fly out the handle if someone suggests
4993760	5000000	that the definition of friendship is not eating my face that's not what he said god damn anyways
5000000	5003920	anyways i was not here for the mature which one i heard i heard was quite funny and i did not
5003920	5012480	hear the dnd what what briefly went down um let's see he attacked and then he guys attacked him back
5012480	5019200	and uh what's with this informal bullshit let's do it i don't know well real quick before you do that
5019200	5026000	hey have you heard of starbound yeah it's you know yeah is there is there is there a lot of

5037440	5042480	creators of terraria except it's uh it's more space-based there's more world exploring is it
5042480	5048800	2d like yeah yeah bits and blocks oh that's what they call those games i mean i like the
5048800	5053440	immersiveness of a 3d environment spencer well well then you do you know some people don't

5147200	5152880	journeyed down an ice hole and found a hissing skeleton named lenave they had complex and
5152880	5158160	disturbing interactions with the skeletons setting him off on a path of violence lenave
5158160	5164080	choked sharpie but sharpie shot back with a burst of electricity staggering the dead man
5164080	5170960	mole rain caught fire with her armulet of summer and grabbed lenave's arm while quark
5170960	5178160	cut said arm off the wounded skeleton began to transform growing two new arms and attacking
5178160	5184240	sharpie with his new limbs the party changed tacks mole rain reattached lenave's arm while
5184240	5189520	christoperg rubbed meat on it together they fashioned a paper hair piece for lenave's skull
5189520	5195680	which stopped him dead in his tracks they quit fighting joined hands and strolled off
5195680	5201200	down the path towards tormod tour the city of unshackled dead it's pretty much it
5202960	5206480	so we made friends with him which i think is pretty admirable
5207920	5213120	you made friends with lenave yeah and you reattached an arm and gave him a toupee that
5213120	5217520	was just sort of a gesture some of those guys yeah we had cut off his arm and then we reattached
5217600	5221840	it and we we had some meat that we rubbed around it because we thought that what a skeleton would
5221840	5227520	enjoy is having meat on his arm yeah made sense to me at the time but more importantly and this was
5227520	5232160	the this was the thing that sealed the deal we started making him uh construction paper hair
5233280	5238320	because i think that even when he wasn't a skeleton he maybe was bald and was insecure
5238320	5246880	about it that's a speculation that's not canon that was but but uh we we are now his friend again
5246880	5254560	and uh you're welcome did we find the uh the tarragon of uh of virtue what the fuck was it
5254560	5260880	called no no we're off to we're off to the territory to tormod of tor yeah so now we have
5260880	5266720	we have lenave with us as a as a compatriot because christoperg is uh possessed and we want to cure
5267040	5272240	him right wherever he is all right lenave how far off is tormod of tor oh it's like a couple
5272240	5278080	minutes you know we're just yeah what do you mean wherever christoperg is i mean where is he
5278080	5282960	is he here i don't see him there's character sheets on the table in front of you oh shit
5282960	5290400	i just got told i guess he is here okay christoperg is here he's uh he's still
5290400	5295040	tied up by that muzzle yeah three minutes off is what i answered your question with
5295680	5303120	all right all right time passes oh yeah it does as time passes you pass by broken gray pillars
5303120	5309600	and piles of glittering black glass glass shattered razor sharp fragments that are strewn
5309600	5316240	about the dusty ground uh lenave speaks he says uh as i was trying to say before all that happened
5316240	5321760	the unshackled are generally peaceful but down here there's more crawling around than just tormod
5321760	5329040	tor's own you know citizens the chained ones still shamble around their mindless horrors that seek not
5329600	5336240	but to snuff out the life of anyone beyond your guard because the chained ones hear no reason like
5336240	5343600	me and so there was no route that took us around in this area no they were yeah they're all around
5343600	5348080	everywhere everywhere they're everywhere they just there's a big circle around where we're going

5508080	5513120	as long as we're giving notes if there's a place and then outside the places there's a place where
5513120	5518560	there's a bunch of monsters unless they exist in a in a in a fucking circle around the place there's
5518560	5525120	got to be a way around you're taking us through the unshackled and telling us we're gonna they're
5526080	5534000	monsters it's a dangerous world man i don't know what you want me to do i'm not worried about
5534000	5541600	anything except for possibly moraine because she's a schizophrenic it's true let's go but
5541600	5552880	if there's an encounter it's on you okay i've got 72 hit points i i i get a little twitchy but i
5552880	5562160	calm myself okay so you continue down you continue down the path you see a destroyed a blown out kind
5562160	5567440	of hut you see the the roof of the hut and then the walls are kind of just falling onto the floor
5567440	5573840	like it's top just collapsed and then you go by a broken fence it's just like a fence but it's all
5573840	5582080	broken it doesn't work to keep stuff out of places should we check out the hut yes keep
5582160	5586160	trot let's check out this hut if you want to check out that hut you better be on your guard
5586160	5594160	because those unchained ones they go in huts sometimes i use i use my stealth and i i creep
5594160	5603760	towards the hut i vote for no hut but if you're if you're a hut lover i think i may be a hut lover
5603760	5608800	do you have stealth are you stealthy yeah i have stealth yeah anyone can be kind of stealthy even
5608960	5613040	if they don't have to take that away from me will you come back if you see anything hazardous and
5613040	5622160	we will just go uh yeah you know if if there's something hazardous i will um use my boots of
5622160	5629760	spry springing and i will sing a special song and you'll know it when you hear it there once was an
5629760	5640160	indian man all right so try not to judge me for singing it so you creep towards the hut and you
5640160	5649040	hear the sound of uh maybe like chomping and gobbling probably those sounds okay don't see
5649040	5656800	anything uh but you now you do see something you see the the roof of the hut kind of shaken shimmy
5656800	5663920	i don't know what huts do they don't dance i guess not i guess not it's definitely shaken though
5664640	5674320	okay scoops okay i there once was an indian okay let's go let's keep going who had a crack
5676880	5682800	it was very we should just keep going okay they walk on ahead but i i walk around the back of
5682800	5687440	that shack and i put my ear up to the wall listen to the chomping oh boy it's louder now
5687440	5693040	because your ears closer can i see through nope it's just a roof uh there's not even any way to
5693040	5700560	like get in i kick in the back wall of the hut what in the fucking harmon you kick in the back
5700560	5706800	wall of the hut man it just kind of crumbles to pieces as if it were like wet rotting wood
5706800	5713120	which it's not it's like some sort of sheet metal that's weird anyway you see you see it's
5713120	5720560	a zombie it's a zombie naked and full of flesh his mouth is just gaping open full of flesh he's
5720560	5725280	trying to chomp on it but his mouth's broken he's like got a broken jar or something he's trying to
5725280	5733360	chomp on what flesh i dead flesh i take my great sword and slash at his neck okay roll that you
5733360	5738880	sure do uh you you cut it clean off he he's not too uh he's yeah he's dead
5743200	5751280	i uh i wipe my sword on the ground and uh i uh i i look around
5752720	5758080	you cut cut cut to me and leneve just just hanging out in the snow oh i just kind of
5758960	5762800	and i go uh so uh is there a mrs leneve
5764800	5772000	no all right now you get back to jeff i examine the hut it's it's just like uh you see two
5772000	5777360	corpses now there was you know the corpse and a zombie but now there's two corpses one's half
5777360	5782800	eaten and there's nothing else in the hut no it's just uh just a roof really just the roof on the
5782800	5787760	ground all right i fuck both of the corpses and i run back to the uh i run back to the to our
5787760	5794240	campaign and let them know what happened do you fuck them like like till you finish no i just now
5794240	5800000	it's just kind of cursory it's just it's just kind of like a like a cursory thing that i do
5800000	5805280	well the kids have a thing called tea bagging on the multiplayer games they teabag each other
5806000	5811360	they put the multi multiplayer shooters they you you crouch over the face of your victim
5811360	5818480	what and it's symbolic that you're tea bagging them no no i i actually fuck him no i know i'm
5818480	5822640	just saying like you just you're doing a thing that it's not a sexual act it's an act of anger
5822640	5828560	look i generally enter any any combat situation with a mild erection and so i i'm like the
5828640	5835440	Comanche of old where i i i enter war with uh with a certain amount of two messes and i uh i uh
5835440	5840720	look i'm not saying i'm a good person i'm just saying that uh if it ain't broke don't fix it so
5840720	5849520	i fuck most of my uh most of my uh my thwarted foes remind me not to have any more questions
5850720	5855360	how are you feeling i feel great until you try to stab me earlier i have 72 hit points
5855360	5861120	i run back into the group i go ah kill the zombies uh fuck a couple people but everything
5861120	5868080	seems to be cool oh did you did you meet jerry no i went back to the hut you see a half-eaten
5868080	5875040	corpse and another corpse without a head i yell jerry you get no response i run back i go no i
5875040	5882160	didn't meet jerry no i might have fucked jerry i didn't but he he didn't have a lot to add well

5888800	5897040	described the corpse uh no okay then i fucked somebody else who's jerry you you just ran off
5897040	5901760	for about two minutes to go fuck something no i heard some rumbling i thought there might be some
5901760	5907280	fucking uh some bad things going on there was i killed a zombie i fucked him both uh as a skeleton
5907280	5916560	are you friends with zombies yeah yeah i mean is jerry a zombie yeah uh oh okay full disclosure i

5943920	5954240	any humans are they your pals sharpie sharpie leave it i'm not leave it i don't i was certain
5954240	5959120	you're gonna hear that it's more sort of weird passive aggressive threats i know that's not a
5959120	5963600	i mean i'm not insane that's just you're insane that's a poignant observation
5964960	5966480	i start running towards timberland
5968240	5974080	term out of torque you you run you run down the path and it's pretty dark but uh as a half elf
5974080	5981440	you could see a little bit you see a crumbling gray wall it's massive and imperious except it's uh
5981440	5986480	it's cracked in many places and you see it's it's attempted to been plastered a bunch of times
5986480	5991920	there's all sorts of plaster patches in the middle there's a big giant wooden gate but it uh
5992800	6001920	it looks all uh rotted rotted gate rotted but uh intact yeah it's definitely still standing i go
6001920	6009200	up and i kick the gate i'm gonna kick in mood you kick the gate and uh your foot just sinks
6009200	6014640	right through it's not even satisfying you just get your leg kind of stuck in the wood in before
6014720	6019520	you extricate it is either they don't understand architecture around here something bad has
6019520	6027760	happened it looks like they live in a neighborhood of zombies so uh i think this is a community uh
6028560	6032560	besieged by the undead yeah and i light a cigarette
6034320	6038640	i i i get really close to you and i i suck in the smoke and then blow it back in your face
6039040	6045680	what the fuck i think we established uh uh 10 minutes ago that i'm schizophrenic so this is my
6045680	6051040	new thing i take a cigarette out of his mouth i blow a smoke ring and i fuck the smoke ring
6054400	6057520	but while i do it i make eye contact with both of them and took sort of
6058080	6065360	sort of a weird warning hey lenev is there any danger if we call out uh no no in fact i will
6066080	6071760	open up you there my idea to call out who are you everybody
6075040	6081040	open just me out here with the idea to call out my idea first calling out
6082560	6085200	bothered to get a quorum about it was punished for it
6085200	6096960	but yeah it's just that i usually say that well there's a new skeleton in town and it's under my
6096960	6106320	body he a lenev he pounds on the door a bit lightly with his his glowing hand i pound on it
6106320	6111840	at the same time open up open up open up saying it louder
6114560	6121840	he takes two or three steps back and uh slowly the gate doors start to grind open open sesame
6124240	6131680	but uh as the gates open you see the the top hinge of the right door it buckles and cracks
6131680	6140240	and you see the door start to crumble and fall on to you guys towards it it's fallen on you
6140880	6147760	backward somersault okay y'all you're you're all taking reflex saves back backward handspring
6149360	6150160	i start clapping
6153920	6161520	wait instead of dodging out of the way sorry she's lost her mind i start clapping but i in my
6161520	6169840	head i'm clapping so hard that the air is going to push away the door while i'm doing
6169840	6173840	while i'm doing my reflex save backward handspring i yell mulraine are you having a stroke
6175200	6183440	no no i'm not i'm saving us all right okay so um the two of you dodge out of the way
6183440	6190480	and uh mulraine as well as lenev get hit by this door so you say just standing there and clapping
6191200	6193760	didn't work i guess not okay
6197440	6200240	but you're saying lenev being a big know-it-all didn't work
6201760	6208000	on what well he still got crushed by a door yeah even though he was guy who knows when to shout
6208000	6214000	and when to knock i guess he had better reflexes you're so like so anyway the two of you uh
