0	16680	From San Francisco, California, at the beautiful Marines Memorial, at San Francisco's Sketchfest,
16680	22680	Harman Town is now in session!
22680	29680	Let's bring this to you, Spencer Crittenden!
29680	31680	Spencer!
38680	39680	Hello!
39680	40680	Hello, Spencer!
40680	41680	How's it going?
41680	44680	It's going alright, and the mayor of Harman Town, you know him, you like him!
44680	46680	Dan Harmon!
53680	55680	I thought maybe there was no one up there.
55680	57680	I was going to get mad and walk out.
57680	61680	I was told the house was full.
61680	65680	Thank you so much, San Francisco, for having us.
69680	70680	Thank you.
70680	72680	No, I'm hooting and hollering for you.
72680	74680	I hope you're having a good Sketchfest.
74680	77680	Jeff just walked off the job.
77680	79680	It's okay.
83680	84680	Wow!
88680	92680	Yeah, we are here in the Marine Memorial Theater and Hotel.
92680	94680	I guess there's rooms here.
94680	96680	Is anybody staying here at the Marine Memorial?
96680	97680	I have.
97680	98680	I've stayed here a bunch of times.
98680	100680	I was talking to them, but yeah.
100680	103680	But while they didn't respond, I tried to jump in there.
103680	104680	You came in real fast.
104680	106680	I don't know if they had a chance.
106680	108680	Because normally you go, is anyone staying here?
108680	110680	It'd be an instant, woo!
110680	111680	Yeah, I guess.
111680	117680	But it's a small enough place that the one person that stayed here was probably...
117680	119680	There he is.
119680	122680	Who is here from Alta Loma?
122680	123680	See?
123680	124680	Nobody.
124680	125680	Nobody.
125680	128680	What floor are you on, sir?
128680	130680	Oh, he won't say.
130680	133680	Yeah, because that's a horrible, creepy thing to ask him.
133680	134680	Well...
134680	135680	He's a private man.
135680	137680	I use a liar.
138680	142680	Well, I was trying to figure out just by using Wikipedia.
142680	144680	Because I was like, oh, Marine...
144680	147680	You get nervous when you get into a veteran area.
147680	149680	You don't want to offend or do anything.
149680	155680	You wouldn't want to stand in a room that was sacred to a branch of the government
155680	160680	and just talk about your fucking self and how many people were at your inauguration.
160680	163680	You want to respect...
167680	169680	I'm doing exactly what he did.
169680	173680	If there's, like, Marines under the stage, like, in Sarcophagi.
173680	174680	You know that...
174680	175680	I don't know.
175680	179680	I don't know if there's, like, Skyrim where there's just, like, soldier ghosts are gonna go,
179680	183680	like, you fucking defiled me, now fight me.
183680	188680	After us, there's gonna be an all-woman's podcast that's gonna get way more people.
191680	193680	Sad.
193680	194680	Apologize.
194680	195680	Sad.
195680	196680	Sad.
196680	197680	You guys saw the chart.
197680	200680	My favorite chart was the one I think everybody saw.
200680	201680	It was, like, the...
201680	203680	It was just based on the transit numbers and the...
203680	208680	It was, like, the first Obama inauguration and then the...
208680	212680	There was something else and then the second Obama inauguration.
212680	213680	And then the...
213680	215680	Or no, it was the Women's March was the something else.
215680	217680	And then the second Obama inauguration.
217680	218680	It was something else.
218680	219680	It was something else.
219680	222680	You ladies ought to be proud of yourselves.
222680	224680	You were something else out there.
224680	227680	You bedazzled democracy.
227680	229680	You went, girl.
232680	234680	I conjugated a little French.
234680	238680	And then there was a visual graphic so that, like, there were two Obama faces that were
238680	239680	identical going, ha!
239680	242680	And then there was, like, a female symbol in the middle of them going, yay!
242680	246680	And then there was, like, a Donald, a little grumpy Donald.
246680	249680	And there was a thing between the grumpy Donald, which was on the bottom,
249680	253680	and the bottommost thing above the whatever.
253680	256680	Because you look and you see the grumpy Donald, which was on the bottom,
256680	259680	like, how many people rode the rails that day in D.C.?
259680	261680	Whatever, 11 or whatever.
261680	262680	And then right...
262680	264680	And then right above it, you're, like, squinting.
264680	266680	You're, like, what is that graphic?
266680	269680	And it's, like, your average work day.
269680	271680	Yeah, that was my favorite graphic.
271680	272680	Yeah, like...
272680	275680	And I don't care if it's a lie.
275680	276680	I love...
276680	277680	Yes, let's...
277680	279680	Yeah, fake news.
280680	284680	Just put fake news on a rock and just throw it.
284680	286680	It's probably not untrue.
286680	288680	But I don't care anymore.
288680	289680	I don't want...
289680	293680	You go on Twitter, which is the greatest place to be in the world,
293680	297680	because, like, you're going to get so much done there, because it's, like...
297680	299680	Let's just keep sitting on Twitter.
299680	301680	I'm not saying let's get off on Twitter.
301680	303680	I'm just sarcastically berating myself.
303680	304680	I'm like, why am I doing this?
304680	308680	You get on Twitter and you're just like, hey, I feel like a piece of shit,
308680	310680	and I want to fucking blow everything up.
310680	311680	Fuck you.
311680	312680	Everyone go fuck yourself.
312680	313680	You're all fucking stupid.
313680	314680	Why have you done this to me?
314680	315680	Fuck off.
315680	317680	And then there's people that just go, like,
317680	320680	uh, better than Hillary?
321680	324680	And then you fucking find yourself arguing with them.
324680	326680	Well, meanwhile, there's people going, like,
326680	328680	amen, brother, high five, and you don't respond to them.
328680	331680	It's, like, my life has become community.
332680	338680	Like, now I'm bad at show running anarchy.
338680	341680	Like, I should just fucking be thanking people as we go down.
341680	343680	Like, thank you, thank you, thank you.
343680	348680	I'm glad that you also feel that this is fucked up.
348680	352680	But I found tonight Dustin Marshall, our producer,
352680	358680	like, turned us on to this Twitter account that is at Trump underscore regrets.
358680	362680	And it's, it's so, feels so bad good.
362680	367680	It's just, like, it just retweets everybody that's just saying to Donald Trump,
367680	368680	like, what the fuck are you doing?
368680	370680	I voted for you.
370680	373680	And it just makes, it just, like, you just feel good.
373680	375680	And you shouldn't feel good.
375680	378680	But it's, like, my favorite ones are not the people that are, like,
378680	379680	what the fuck are you doing?
379680	381680	You promised you'd throw out the Mexicans.
381680	384680	And I'm, like, okay, that's not, um, he's gonna,
384680	386680	they're gonna be a return customer.
386680	388680	They're gonna be, like, all right, now that's better.
388680	390680	Like, like, they're, they're taken care of.
390680	392680	But, like, I like the people that are, like,
392680	396680	why are you bitching about the New York Times, you pussy?
396680	399680	I voted for you because I'm a man.
399680	400680	I like that.
400680	401680	I'm, like, yeah, fucking yeah.
401680	405680	Like, like, like, because that picture that you saw in your history book
405680	412680	of, of Mussolini and his friends at the, like, partway through World War II,
412680	415680	because Italy didn't make it all the way to the end.
416680	419680	Even though they literally invented, you know, it's like the word fascism,
419680	422680	even though, like, Hitler kind of, he kind of nailed it.
422680	423680	Oh, hi, Spencer, how are you?
423680	425680	Hey, guys.
425680	427680	Yeah, Hitler was great.
427680	429680	I mean, from the start.
429680	431680	Fascism. Hitler was great at fascism.
431680	433680	He was better than Mussolini.
433680	436680	Also, a terrific painter.
436680	443680	There, there, there is the classic photo from the end of fascism in Italy.
443680	447680	It is Mussolini and his various friends, his entourage,
447680	452680	his turtle and his Mikey or whatever their names are,
452680	457680	drama and E pants.
457680	458680	E pants.
458680	461680	And they're upside down because they've been dragged through the,
461680	463680	the market and they've been hung up like meat.
463680	467680	And, and the people standing outside them, like, going,
467680	469680	hey, look at this, those aren't liberals.
469680	472680	Those are disgruntled former fascists.
473680	474680	The liberals are dead.
474680	476680	Like, like they're in prison. They've left.
476680	478680	They have been, they were rounded up and shot.
478680	482680	I mean, like fascism just eats through your country like a cancer.
482680	485680	And then it eats itself because there's nothing left to eat.
485680	487680	And it does it in record time.
487680	489680	It's a modern disease.
489680	492680	It shouldn't be dismissed much like anorexia.
492680	496680	It's like there's people that dismiss eating disorders because like,
496680	500680	like a bad person will go like, oh, I can't find an anorexic in Africa.
500680	502680	So we should dismiss this.
502680	504680	No, it's a modern like thing.
504680	508680	That's like germane to like this particular context.
508680	513680	Fascism is only possible in like a modern context,
513680	517680	a post-industrial context where it's like people that get poor,
517680	520680	that, that, that have been promised utopia,
520680	523680	they start to get freaked out and disgruntled.
523680	526680	Multiculturalism starts to scare them things.
526680	528680	This Christmas isn't going to be like last Christmas.
528680	531680	That's the, that's the first thing that happens.
531680	533680	That's basically what it is.
533680	536680	It's like, I got a BB gun last year and this year I got Optimus Prime.
536680	538680	What the fuck's happening?
538680	540680	That's the beginning of fascism.
540680	541680	That's the potting soil.
541680	546680	You just made me sad about George Michael.
546680	549680	The very next day.
549680	553680	I just, I was thinking like Optimus Prime is way better than a BB gun.
553680	555680	That's what I was thinking. Yeah.
555680	557680	Optimus Prime was my generation's BB gun.
557680	559680	I don't know what I said about a BB gun.
559680	562680	But anyways, I like people get disgruntled,
562680	564680	dissatisfied and then, and then some, it's like,
564680	568680	you can't blame the funny guy with the funny hair that ends up clowning
568680	570680	around and it distracts everybody.
570680	572680	It's, it's all of us. We're all to blame.
572680	576680	It's like, like, like it's, it just becomes this weird thing.
576680	578680	It's an infection that sets in.
578680	579680	What is my point?
579680	580680	What are we going to do?
580680	582680	I don't know what the fuck we're going to do.
582680	585680	The like, why, why do you need to hear this from me?
585680	588680	You've been thinking about it all day.
588680	590680	We're, we're, we're all watching it happen.
590680	594680	Like we're just, we just keep feeling like, what are we supposed to do?
594680	595680	Like our legs are twitchy.
595680	599680	I'm like, do I grab a rock?
599680	602680	What does the rock do?
602680	604680	Well, who would I throw that?
604680	606680	Do I wait until there's someone to throw it at?
606680	608680	It might be my neighbor.
608680	610680	Are they, do I, do I,
610680	613680	are they coming for my housekeeper's family?
613680	615680	Are they coming for my, my friend?
615680	620680	Let's talk about that for a second.
620680	623680	I'd like to see some papers.
623680	624680	I mean, it's good.
624680	625680	It's a thing.
625680	628680	Like Jerry Brown, our beloved governor,
628680	632680	he's, he makes a speech and he says like, listen, man, they're not,
632680	633680	they can't come in here.
633680	634680	They can't take anybody.
634680	635680	It's not going to happen.
635680	641680	And then in the same speech, he's like, plus silver lining monorail money.
641680	642680	He's psyched.
642680	644680	But I was like, I don't understand.
644680	649680	I don't, I, all of us, I think everybody is like walking around in a weird
649680	653680	days because we're kind of like, well, we've never, ever, ever,
653680	655680	ever lived in this world.
655680	659680	Like we've never lived in a world that feels to us like it's in a history book.
659680	664680	Like we're just, you just open up your phone and it's just like, oh,
664680	668680	all Goodwills are closed.
668680	669680	Wait, I was about to buy pants.
669680	673680	And then the, like, the head of Goodwill then starts a different account
673680	678680	and goes, fuck the police.
678680	681680	And you're like, everybody follow the head of Goodwill.
681680	682680	And then it's gone.
682680	685680	And then, and then meanwhile, all you're, you know, it's like, oh, this,
685680	688680	I got fired because I followed the Goodwill guy.
688680	689680	Like, I don't know what to do now.
689680	692680	It's like, like, like, like, like, we're freaking the fuck out.
692680	693680	We don't know what to do.
693680	695680	What do we, what do we do?
695680	696680	When do you move?
696680	697680	When do you, when do you move?
697680	698680	And what do you, where do you move?
698680	699680	And how do you move?
699680	708680	I do know, I do know that the A line, I don't think it's my last line.
708680	711680	I do know that I will die for my housekeeper.
711680	712680	I will.
712680	714680	I will, I will meet you outside my house.
714680	722680	And I'm sure she won't want to, she won't want to hide at my house,
722680	726680	though, because it'll be like this weird conflict of interest thing
726680	729680	where I'm like, here, hide in there.
729680	738680	But also there's, you've, it's not because of my, my respect for her.
738680	742680	It's because I'm a baby man that, that like most Californians like lives
742680	749680	at the mercy of a vibrant, you know, like, like, like flowing multicultural
749680	751680	fucking like it's arterial flow.
751680	755680	Like everybody from every country that ever has any problem that's running
755680	758680	from something, hiding from something that, that hasn't found what they're
758680	759680	looking for yet.
759680	760680	They're supposed to be able to come here.
760680	762680	We're supposed to be the hotel lobby of the world.
762680	764680	That was our gimmick, a death to monarchy.
764680	767680	We hold these truths to be self-evident.
767680	771680	We barely need to say them, but here's a giant fucking contract you can exploit
771680	773680	300 years from now.
773680	775680	We hold these truths to be self-evident.
775680	777680	I can say whatever the fuck I want.
777680	779680	I can do whatever the fuck I want.
779680	781680	But, yeah, except for black people and women.
781680	784680	Yeah, and you can't tweet about Baron Trump.
784680	785680	Yeah.
785680	787680	Kids are off limits.
787680	788680	Kids are off limits.
788680	789680	Kids are off limits.
789680	790680	Fire the writer.
790680	793680	Fire the writer that joked about the kids because kids are off limits.
793680	794680	Okay.
794680	795680	She's fired.
795680	797680	Can she come work over here?
797680	798680	You're a piece of shit.
798680	799680	You should fucking die.
799680	801680	You cocksucking piece of shit.
801680	808680	Do you want to just follow this SNL writer for the rest of her life,
808680	812680	haunting her to make sure she just kills herself?
812680	816680	What happened to job creation?
816680	823680	Can't she just go work for another shitty person you don't like?
823680	828680	Are you afraid of all the people that disagree with you?
828680	830680	Do shit whatever they want.
830680	834680	That you will be left alone watching Gober Pyle in your basement?
835680	838680	Like, what is this impulse we have?
838680	840680	I know what it is.
840680	842680	That was a rhetorical question.
842680	843680	I know what it is.
843680	845680	And that's the only thing that we have to save us.
845680	849680	All of these fucking people, every time you get in a fight with somebody online,
849680	856680	they always, if they're not a Russian bot or just like a fucking weird, greasy troll that's just like,
856680	863680	you know they're shaped like an egg and they're just terrified of women and they're so fucking mad.
863680	866680	It's like, this is this guy talking to my girlfriend.
866680	870680	She posted a picture of her and her mom at the women's march.
870680	873680	It's just like, in real life, like this thing,
873680	878680	it's like, you come around and you see like a group of guys in digital reality
878680	881680	standing around your girlfriend going like,
881680	883680	yeah, but slut shouldn't abort.
883680	885680	What the fuck are you people doing?
885680	887680	Get the fuck away from my girlfriend.
887680	889680	But then you're sexist.
889680	892680	Like, are you fucking out of your mind?
892680	894680	It's a photo of her and her mom.
894680	896680	What the fuck are you doing?
896680	898680	Why are you using the word slut?
898680	900680	Who the fuck brought that up?
900680	901680	What do you have?
901680	903680	God damn it, this is not a comedy show.
908680	912680	Why are you so fucking mad and who are you mad at?
912680	914680	You are mad at a fiction.
914680	916680	You are mad at some propaganda poster.
916680	920680	You are mad at some racist fucking drawing you saw in Hustler.
920680	923680	Like, you have been told that you are paying for abortions.
923680	925680	You're paying for welfare.
925680	926680	Oh, your money.
926680	928680	Oh, your money's going to all these poor people.
928680	931680	Motherfucker, my money's going to everybody.
932680	935680	Mine and Alec Baldwin's and Tina Fey's.
935680	937680	Like, like the 1%.
937680	941680	Oh, California pays for fucking everything.
941680	943680	Everything.
944680	946680	And we're bluer than blue.
947680	949680	And we're richer than Christ.
949680	951680	Well, that's not a...
951680	954680	He was notoriously broke.
954680	956680	We're richer than Christ.
956680	958680	He never releases returns.
958680	959680	We don't know.
959680	960680	We don't know.
960680	964680	Jesus Christ needs to release his fucking...
964680	967680	His 1090 of Purim.
968680	971680	That's a lot of miscellaneous income.
971680	972680	Let's face it.
972680	974680	I mean, how much did he really render a deceaser?
974680	975680	We don't know.
975680	976680	Yeah.
977680	982680	If you could turn water into wine, I'm pretty sure you can claim home office space.
983680	984680	Yeah.
985680	987680	He knew where the Caymans were.
989680	993680	I want to say where was I, but I don't want to know where I was.
993680	994680	I want to make...
994680	996680	You were slowly descending into madness.
996680	997680	I know.
997680	1000680	It's just like...
1000680	1001680	Here's the thing.
1001680	1002680	Like, so...
1002680	1004680	Here's what I was going to talk about.
1004680	1006680	This is this popular thing now that we're all encountering.
1006680	1009680	We're all saying, oh, King George is mad.
1009680	1012680	Like, he just ate his own shit on TV.
1012680	1015680	Like, he just pulled out a doo-doo and said, like, this isn't a doo-doo.
1015680	1016680	It's a candy bar and ate it.
1016680	1019680	And we're going, like, he's mentally ill.
1019680	1024680	We should get him out of the most powerful desk we have available to any of us.
1024680	1026680	He just ate shit.
1026680	1030680	He might mistake anything for anything.
1030680	1032680	We're the most people.
1032680	1033680	What do we do?
1033680	1034680	And you just...
1034680	1039680	You can express that as a person who maybe hated Hillary Clinton.
1039680	1041680	Maybe voted, loved Bernie Sanders.
1041680	1043680	Maybe you loved Jill Stein.
1043680	1044680	Like, you...
1044680	1049680	Maybe you, for a fucking weird fever dream second, thought Donald Trump was a good idea.
1049680	1058680	But, like, by and large, you could just be a person just saying, okay, now I think this seems,
1058680	1069680	given the stakes involved with this corporation, I think we ought to examine all of our options
1069680	1072680	and just look at what you've been doing.
1072680	1078680	And honestly, I know you don't have to take your hands from behind your back.
1078680	1081680	There's no rule that says you have to.
1081680	1083680	It's weird that you won't.
1083680	1086680	And we'd like to see what's in your hands, Damien.
1086680	1089680	We'd like to see what's in your hands.
1089680	1090680	Because you're very...
1090680	1094680	You seem very proud that there's nothing in your hands.
1094680	1097680	And you said you'd show your hands if you won.
1097680	1101680	And then you said, I'll show my hands after the audit.
1101680	1103680	And then you said, I'll show my hands never.
1103680	1112680	And then your fucking weird nutcracker dressed Decepticon went on Meet the Press and said,
1112680	1116680	okay, now he's going to show his hands on Sunday morning after brunch.
1116680	1117680	And then you said, no, I'm not.
1117680	1120680	And I don't know what the fuck is in your fucking hands.
1120680	1121680	You're the fucking president.
1121680	1124680	What the fuck is in your tax report?
1124680	1127680	Sorry, you distracted me.
1127680	1130680	The tiny hands thing, I mean, whatever.
1130680	1132680	If it gets to him, let's do it.
1132680	1134680	But I'm like, if we're talking about...
1134680	1137680	If that's a small dick thing, then fuck everybody.
1137680	1140680	I think it's just fun because he hates it.
1141680	1143680	Whatever he hates, just pile on it.
1143680	1146680	Spencer and I were talking about earlier, is it better...
1146680	1148680	I don't know about you guys.
1148680	1152680	I fantasize, if I met Donald Trump, what would I do?
1152680	1154680	Would I fuck with him?
1154680	1156680	Would I try to just...
1156680	1158680	I would tear a mattress tag off of him.
1163680	1165680	You're in soaked.
1165680	1166680	Mattress tag.
1167680	1170680	They got those videos and they're just going to keep them.
1170680	1175680	Russia's going to make Trump do their bidding because they got the pee-pee videos.
1176680	1178680	They're fucking geniuses.
1178680	1182680	But who among his followers wouldn't just start saying pee's delicious?
1182680	1184680	Why wouldn't they...
1184680	1187680	When I saw that thing, I was like, no, that fits perfectly.
1187680	1192680	The story is that he paid hookers to pee on the Obama's...
1193680	1198680	I'm running my very easy to run Trump simulator...
1198680	1202680	Trump fan simulator, which is 16 kilobytes.
1205680	1208680	And I'm going, fucking, hip-hop hooray.
1209680	1211680	That's what I want in my Trump.
1211680	1215680	I want him to pay hookers to pee on the Obama's hotel bed.
1216680	1219680	If he's gobbling the pee and going, I love pee.
1219680	1221680	I love pee.
1221680	1223680	Like, maybe. Maybe.
1224680	1225680	Like, maybe it would flip them.
1225680	1228680	We're waiting for his fans to flip.
1228680	1230680	His fans don't flip.
1230680	1234680	His fans are a fucking wine stain.
1234680	1238680	Like, they don't turn into an ice cream stain.
1240680	1249680	His fans have committed to such a degree of psychologically criminal, fucking treasonous toxicity.
1250680	1253680	There's no fucking anything.
1253680	1263680	They have committed so long ago to the idea that they are simply sick and tired of being told they're stupid and wrong.
1263680	1267680	And so, like, proving them stupid and proving them wrong is like...
1267680	1270680	It's like Shining Sun on Birdman.
1272680	1275680	He was a superhero character in the 70s.
1275680	1277680	He got his strength from the sun.
1277680	1279680	I should have picked something else.
1279680	1287680	Is there a chance that somebody, as a fan of our show, brought their Trump-supporting father or mother here and they were just sitting there really uncomfortably right now?
1287680	1295680	I would show anybody in here that was willing to, in the interest of connection and stuff,
1295680	1303680	I would offer you the utmost verbal and psychological and spiritual protection if you were willing to come up here and be a voice for the other.
1303680	1307680	I understand, absolutely, if you don't want to.
1307680	1312680	And don't force yourself if you're on the fence, because the truth is, being on the fence doesn't count.
1312680	1318680	But if somebody was passionate, okay, sir, if you want to come up here and...
1318680	1319680	Okay.
1319680	1321680	I didn't know that was going to happen.
1331680	1332680	Hello, sir.
1333680	1334680	What's your name?
1335680	1336680	My name's Zane.
1336680	1337680	Zane, all right.
1337680	1339680	Zane, grab a microphone, Zane.
1342680	1353680	And Zane, for real, like Dan said, like total respect for coming up here and this is a safety zone where we're not going to just take a giant cramp on you.
1353680	1358680	Yeah, but also we can't make any promises for the audience, who's a group of uncontrollable people.
1358680	1362680	No, shit got mutinous out there pretty quick, because there's a rumbling.
1363680	1367680	Yeah, I'm actually lied, but I have a solution.
1367680	1370680	Yeah, this is what I thought was the case.
1372680	1375680	You're calling your main mood for not being a Trump supporter.
1375680	1376680	Yeah, that's what's happening.
1376680	1379680	Zane, would you call your solution final?
1381680	1382680	Because you might still count.
1382680	1384680	Under the circumstances, I would say no.
1385680	1388680	I started a software project to end suicide within our lifetime.
1389680	1391680	All right, well, you high-rode at us.
1394680	1397680	I came up here to help inner city children.
1397680	1399680	I pretended I was a Trump fan.
1399680	1400680	Okay, well, tell us about it.
1400680	1401680	That's fine.
1401680	1405680	Okay, so we have a website called letsendsuicide.com.
1406680	1415680	And basically, we're going to provide a machine learning algorithm that will monitor your social media output and determine if you're in a depressive or manic episode.
1416680	1419680	And then from there, we have version 1.5.
1420680	1421680	Boom.
1421680	1423680	Easy, easy, steady.
1423680	1431680	We have a version 1.5 where a medical health professional will get in touch with you if it thinks that you are depressive.
1431680	1432680	Wait, hold up, Zane.
1432680	1434680	So you're saying that you're...
1434680	1437680	This audience has heard elevator pitches for startups before.
1444680	1445680	I'm not saying it's fair.
1445680	1447680	I'm just saying, this is what I'm realizing.
1448680	1449680	This is true.
1450680	1451680	Yeah, it's non-profit.
1451680	1453680	We're incorporating next week.
1455680	1458680	Well, yeah, I mean, that was kind of the inspiration for it.
1458680	1463680	You know how to win them over these fickle bunch is to tell us what personal investment you have in this.
1464680	1465680	I have a lot of...
1465680	1470680	I have, in personal experience, more of my family members committing suicide, but I have several friends who have.
1470680	1474680	And I think it's a major problem, and I think that we have the technology to take care of it.
1475680	1476680	Can you explain how that works?
1476680	1479680	Because I think a lot of people are going, wait, so if I...
1479680	1480680	It's only in public.
1480680	1481680	Do I sign up for...
1481680	1482680	Hey, you sign up.
1483680	1487680	Right now this is just an idea, so I'm recruiting everybody that wants to help out with it.
1489680	1494680	And if I say, I just got home from my job at Universal Studios theme park,
1495680	1498680	the T-Rex's balls needed to be cleaned again.
1499680	1501680	I want to fucking kill myself.
1501680	1504680	And then this app goes, boop, boop, boop, boop.
1505680	1508680	There's a big giant monolithic computer system.
1508680	1511680	But really, I mean, I'm being silly, but we need...
1511680	1514680	Well, you have to sign up to this...
1514680	1516680	Yes, it's opt-in.
1516680	1517680	You opt-in.
1517680	1519680	You're not just monitoring everybody that says...
1519680	1523680	No, it's only your public social media output, whatever you want to provide to the actual...
1523680	1531680	So if you feel like you might be suicidal, you go to this dot com and say, monitor me and tell me that I'm possibly suicidal?
1532680	1534680	Hopefully you would do that before you got to that point.
1534680	1536680	It's for people like myself who have mental health issues.
1537680	1540680	Yeah, obviously the logical part of your brain,
1540680	1547680	and I'm not knowing enough about that mind state except that it does deserve care.
1547680	1554680	I don't want to trump over anybody, but the obvious kind of internal logic, comedic mechanisms go like,
1554680	1563680	okay, so just logically, I'm either A, happy, therefore not really anticipating a future suicide,
1563680	1565680	and therefore not signing up for this.
1565680	1569680	Or I'm B, suicidal, and therefore probably also not taking steps to...
1569680	1570680	Right.
1570680	1572680	Well, we'll have an emergency contact system.
1572680	1574680	That's one of the ideas with the app.
1574680	1577680	So if you ever need to talk to anybody, there will be a volunteer...
1577680	1581680	And so I would say to the asshole me that just said that,
1582680	1589680	and you confirm if this is right or not, that suicidal ideation and the states of mind that come with it,
1589680	1595680	for some people, we can dismiss them because we're like, well, I've never been that sad.
1595680	1597680	I mean, give me a break.
1597680	1604680	But for some people, it's so chronic and so constant that actually some people do have to live with skipping on that pond
1604680	1609680	and that those people can go in a clear state of mind, like, this is going to happen again.
1609680	1610680	History's taught me.
1610680	1611680	Absolutely.
1611680	1613680	And so I'm putting this padlock on the fridge.
1613680	1615680	Yeah, I myself am bipolar.
1615680	1617680	Bipolar one.
1617680	1619680	And I basically...
1619680	1620680	Thank you.
1620680	1621680	Thank you.
1621680	1623680	You can multiply that applause times two because...
1623680	1624680	Exactly.
1624680	1625680	I have two states of mind.
1625680	1626680	I'm actually a Gemini.
1626680	1632680	You got whoops from the half of the bipolar people who are currently manic.
1632680	1633680	Exactly.
1633680	1634680	Perfect.
1634680	1635680	Is that offensive?
1635680	1637680	No, not offensive at all.
1637680	1641680	You got the most whoops ever, period.
1641680	1642680	Period.
1642680	1643680	Let'sendsuicide.com.
1643680	1644680	Nice.
1644680	1646680	Oh, so you need volunteers?
1646680	1651680	Well, for the first version of the app, we are basically taking pro bono work.
1651680	1661680	The first version is 0.1.0, which is dedicated to Carrie Fisher, mental health advocate, space princess.
1661680	1666680	Well, give us a taste of the suicide statistics just so we understand, because we don't think
1666680	1667680	about this stuff as...
1667680	1671680	Aren't they a really leading cause and male death?
1671680	1672680	Yeah, absolutely.
1672680	1673680	Like, they're up there, right?
1673680	1674680	Yeah.
1674680	1675680	I mean, Alaska has huge issues.
1675680	1676680	I don't have the numbers on me.
1676680	1680680	I'm like a Trump, so I just come up here completely off the dome.
1680680	1681680	No, it's okay.
1681680	1683680	We'd rather you say you don't know.
1683680	1684680	But it's big.
1684680	1685680	It's a big deal.
1685680	1686680	It's not like you're...
1686680	1687680	Yeah, suicide.
1687680	1691680	It's not like your pet cause that's like little tiny, little bitty, bitty thing in the face
1691680	1693680	of breast cancer or prostate cancer.
1693680	1698680	Well, it's funny you mentioned that, because version 10 seeks to end cancer with an artist
1698680	1699680	suicide.
1699680	1700680	Whoa!
1700680	1701680	Geez!
1701680	1705680	I jumped like versions like two through nine, but version 10...
1705680	1707680	So this thing is slowly becoming Skynet.
1707680	1708680	Absolutely.
1708680	1713680	It starts by preventing you from killing yourself, then it prevents your cancer, and then the
1713680	1716680	version 4.0 is like, why aren't you a computer?
1716680	1718680	Yeah, basically.
1718680	1722680	Like you post on Facebook, I had a great day, and the thing is like...
1722680	1723680	Eep.
1723680	1724680	Eep.
1724680	1725680	Eep.
1725680	1727680	A siren goes off over your head.
1727680	1728680	Yeah.
1728680	1729680	The squawk...
1729680	1732600	I have a question, and I'm not trying to be provocative here.
1732600	1736360	You seem like a very sympathetic, empathetic guy.
1736360	1737360	You're doing this...
1737360	1738360	Try to be.
1738360	1742960	Which sounds like a very selfless, very noble thing.
1742960	1745080	I'm not trying to be a dick, and I know that the...
1745080	1746080	No, please.
1746080	1747080	I need feedback, so...
1748080	1757400	I have friends that are very smart, very emotionally sensitive, intelligent people who believe
1757400	1761680	politically in things that I just don't really quite grasp, because I don't see the empathy
1761680	1762680	in their politics.
1762680	1764680	I don't see the empathetic part of...
1764680	1769080	We've become too polarized, and the problem with the U.S. system is that we have two parties.
1769080	1771920	We need a third party to balance out the other two.
1771920	1774080	So I also started a new political party.
1775080	1776080	Well, Trump...
1776080	1778080	Yeah, I noticed you didn't get paid for that.
1778080	1780080	We're all out of ideas, so...
1780080	1784080	Trump has already vowed to end all political parties by 10 years from now.
1784080	1785080	Oh, shit.
1785080	1786080	Well, we've got to work fast, I guess.
1786080	1790080	Political parties have been running the country for 300 years with no results.
1790080	1791080	Sad!
1793080	1795080	It's called New Rally.
1795080	1797080	You can find us at newrally.us.
1797080	1798080	New rally.
1798080	1799080	New rally.
1799080	1800080	Think neutrality.
1800080	1801080	Think new reality.
1801080	1802080	Wait a minute.
1802080	1804080	You just made it harder to remember.
1804080	1805080	No?
1805080	1806080	Did I?
1806080	1807080	Wait.
1807080	1809080	Why did you guys react to your feedback?
1809080	1811080	I was reacting because it's hard to remember.
1811080	1813080	It sounds too Orwellian, I think.
1813080	1815080	I think it goes a little into the...
1815080	1816080	Perhaps.
1817080	1818080	What's it called?
1818080	1819080	The New Speed?
1819080	1826080	Well, this is where he points you at the new rally's flags, Latin insignia, which is,
1826080	1828080	what's your fucking idea?
1829080	1832080	All bets are off at this point.
1832080	1837080	I'd love for everybody that has an idea to let us know.
1837080	1840080	I don't fucking know what to do.
1842080	1848080	It's like a disaster movie, like a cheap sci-fi one with an 80s pop star as the star.
1850080	1854080	The reason why there's not as much dramatic shit happening outside your window is just
1854080	1855080	because why should it?
1855080	1857080	That would cost too much.
1857080	1861080	Most of the scenes are just happening on a two-walled set with Debbie Gibson saying,
1861080	1864080	so they're mosquitoes, but they're men?
1867080	1870080	It's all happening on Twitter, basically, for me, because it's the only thing I have
1870080	1871080	time to go to.
1871080	1875080	It's like I said to a congressman today, not even my own, just some random one that
1875080	1876080	tweeted something.
1876080	1881080	I was just like, because he said something provocative and hyperbolic and bravado-filled
1882080	1887080	about how the Republicans have blood on their hands and they were accountable for all this
1887080	1888080	thing.
1888080	1894080	I was just like, not being a dick, but just going like, most of us voted for you guys
1894080	1897080	and nothing happened.
1897080	1901080	I just, I swear to God, I'm only asking, what do we do?
1901080	1903080	He didn't answer and then someone else did.
1903080	1907080	It's like, what you do is you visit your representative and then you take a sponge
1907080	1910080	and you put it on your head and you roller skate down the street.
1910080	1914080	It's not that those things aren't the solution.
1914080	1919080	It's just that they don't sound like the solution.
1919080	1925080	You compare that to a 4chan thread where people just go, take this picture of a frog fucking
1925080	1934080	the Statue of Liberty and copy and paste it and just fuck everything.
1934080	1939080	That we know how to do because we love to be angry and we love to shake pillars.
1939080	1941080	We love to show up for stuff.
1941080	1943080	We love to be defiant.
1943080	1945080	We love to express ourselves.
1945080	1948080	How do we, what do we do?
1948080	1951080	I don't expect you to know.
1951080	1952080	I might.
1952080	1953080	I don't know.
1953080	1958080	Basically, we're trying to increase protests, protests outside of our U.S. capital.
1958080	1960080	It's entirely volunteer.
1960080	1963080	Whoever wants to sign up can sign up.
1963080	1967080	Is it because if we, is it?
1967080	1968080	Continue.
1968080	1969080	Why are you laughing?
1969080	1972080	I'm just having a good time.
1972080	1978080	Is it because if we increase protests, is it because?
1978080	1980080	This won't leave this room.
1980080	1981080	Okay.
1981080	1982080	This isn't being recorded.
1982080	1984080	If the answer is yes.
1984080	1989080	Is it because the more we do that, the more we increase the likelihood of a Kent State
1989080	1993080	massacre and can actually start getting things done?
1993080	1997080	Are we nothing more than generals commanding from behind?
1997080	2007080	Everybody get in the streets and express yourself knowing that Hitler is in the White House
2007080	2011080	and that, therefore, something is going to happen?
2011080	2017080	We're going to find out one way or another.
2018080	2019080	Let's hear it for Zane, everybody.
2019080	2023080	Zane, thank you for coming up, brother.
2023080	2025080	Thank you.
2025080	2028080	Thank you, Zane.
2028080	2031080	I think his Q rating evens out.
2031080	2042080	He lied to get up here to prevent suicide with a specious system that will also include
2042080	2049080	a third party that will consist of waiting to be killed.
2049080	2054080	But I think, all in all, a good guy.
2054080	2064080	I don't think we should, you know, if we hate him, our priorities are fucked.
2064080	2068080	Because there's a lot more to hate right now.
2068080	2070080	I don't know what to do, man.
2070080	2074080	I'm on my elliptical every day and when you see me forget to...
2074080	2076080	Thanks, guys.
2076080	2079080	I was going to say, you are looking hard as a rock.
2079080	2084080	That's why our side is not going to win because that's where our high bar of heroism is.
2084080	2088080	I'm going to forgo the Haagen-Dazs tomorrow.
2088080	2094080	Yes, Patrick Henry, yes!
2094080	2096080	I agree, absolutely.
2096080	2100080	I think I'm an absolute fucking heroic man for being on that elliptical.
2100080	2102080	It certainly feels like it.
2102080	2107080	Thank you, Dad.
2107080	2112080	When you see me in that last song, when it's only the good...
2112080	2114080	Where was it?
2114080	2120080	I'm thinking about it being over the exercise.
2120080	2128080	But I'm also just thinking, like, oh, I'm going to elliptical democracy.
2128080	2132080	I'm going to, like, what am I going to do with these skills?
2132080	2139080	I'm going to have more muscle tissue and more heart, less heart disease actuarially.
2139080	2141080	What a great metaphor.
2141080	2143080	You feel like you're doing something but you're going nowhere.
2143080	2146080	It's fantastic.
2146080	2148080	Jeff, tell me this.
2148080	2150080	Spencer, if you...
2150080	2153080	What do you really, like, project?
2153080	2156080	Because a big part of the problem here is just confusion.
2156080	2157080	Like, we've never been...
2157080	2158080	We don't know what's going on.
2158080	2159080	We don't know what to expect.
2159080	2161080	We just keep going, holy shit, they can't do that.
2161080	2162080	They can't do that.
2162080	2163080	This is crazy.
2163080	2166080	What do we actually...
2166080	2170080	Whether you want to project to the end of your life...
2170080	2175080	Because that's the only thing I can project to and I'll go first.
2175080	2180080	Or if you want to project, like, three years, five years, like, whatever.
2180080	2184080	But all I know right now is that I'm going to fucking die.
2184080	2187080	Like, and I'm going to die in the street.
2187080	2188080	They can't kill all of us.
2188080	2189080	What?
2189080	2191080	They can't kill all of us.
2191080	2194080	They can't kill all of us.
2194080	2196080	They can't.
2196080	2203080	But it will be very difficult and they will spend a lot of time cleaning up afterwards.
2203080	2208080	And what they can't do, basically, is throw us all in prison.
2208080	2210080	And so, like...
2210080	2213080	And it's, like, weirder to start with the killing.
2213080	2215080	Like, even Hitler didn't, you know?
2215080	2217080	Exactly.
2217080	2219080	Well, it's, like, so...
2219080	2224080	It's, like, well, it's going to come to this thing where it's just, like, this game of Red Rover.
2224080	2228080	Like, that's all democracy comes down to.
2228080	2231080	It doesn't matter who has drones and who has tear gas and who has anything.
2231080	2237080	It's just, like, all the sheep have to decide it's better to trample than to bleat.
2237080	2238080	You know?
2238080	2239080	There is no bleeding.
2239080	2241080	It won't work.
2241080	2242080	Bleeding is for farmers.
2242080	2245080	Like, farmers cut the power off to the fences.
2245080	2250080	I came up with that on Twitter today while I was drunk on the plane.
2250080	2252080	And I'm sure if Orwell were in the wings, he'd be like,
2252080	2253080	I came up with that.
2253080	2257080	You just didn't read my book and...
2258080	2259080	But for all I know, I fucking...
2259080	2262080	He'd be like, whoa, I should have gone with that.
2262080	2263080	I just...
2263080	2270080	But I feel like it's, like, we are the majority and we are soft and we, by and large,
2270080	2273080	don't pride ourselves on our ability to hunt and kill.
2273080	2274080	So...
2274080	2278080	And yet, for some strange reason, we don't pride ourselves on being sheep.
2278080	2283080	For some strange reason, politically, to call someone a sheep is, like, it's to say,
2283080	2285080	oh, you're a piece of shit.
2285080	2287080	For some reason, we all agree with that.
2287080	2290080	Like, oh, no, I'm not a sheep.
2290080	2293080	I'm a totally autonomous fucking thing.
2293080	2297080	Like, I just happen to live in a 300 million member honeycomb
2297080	2302080	and fill out forms every time I work and all this stuff
2302080	2306080	and receive all the comforts and wipe my ass with two-ply cottonelle
2306080	2309080	that was spun by a robot somewhere in Singapore.
2309080	2310080	Like, I...
2310080	2311080	Me?
2311080	2312080	No, I'm not a sheep.
2312080	2314080	Oh, don't offend me.
2314080	2315080	It's like, like, maybe that's...
2315080	2323080	Everyone, go to letsendsuicide.com and help Dan Harmon.
2323080	2328080	There is a vast minority of carnivorous assholes who pride themselves
2328080	2331080	on sinking their blood-encrusted teeth into our throats
2331080	2334080	and watching the rest of us scatter.
2334080	2335080	And I just...
2335080	2338080	Sometimes you see videos or reading things or hearing Pink Floyd songs
2338080	2343080	about the concept of soft herd animals
2343080	2347080	just having a fucking nuff and becoming a scourge
2347080	2349080	and just going, yeah!
2349080	2350080	Like, guess what?
2350080	2351080	We're the new fence.
2351080	2354080	You're in the middle of a sheep pen that you thought you compromised.
2354080	2356080	We are the fence.
2356080	2358080	You are feeding in the midst of us.
2358080	2361080	You are eating that throat and it will be your last.
2361080	2366080	You are going to be suffocated with delicious wool
2366080	2372080	and trampled with vegan hooves.
2372080	2374080	What was my point?
2374080	2375080	Okay.
2375080	2376080	Well, for that...
2376080	2377080	Because that's how...
2377080	2380080	Because I'm not a politician and I don't know how this shit works
2380080	2383080	and I've got the congressman's numbers on my phone
2383080	2386080	and my girlfriend wants to, like, we're going to fucking do this shit.
2386080	2387080	We're going to...
2387080	2390080	We're going to go to Kamala What's-Your-Name's house every day
2390080	2392080	and whatever the fuck.
2392080	2393080	Harris!
2393080	2394080	Her name's Harris!
2395080	2397080	I didn't mean what's-her-name because she's not a human.
2397080	2399080	I just couldn't remember her name
2399080	2402080	and you could have said Harris more gently, like, Harris.
2405080	2407080	I'm sure she's a wonderful person.
2409080	2413080	My girlfriend is, like, down for that
2413080	2420080	and all I see in my crystal ball is me outside my home
2420080	2425080	in Las Feliz holding a 2x4, clumsily,
2425080	2429080	with one of my dog's blood smeared across it
2429080	2433080	because somebody fucked with it and that's how it started
2433080	2440080	and my friends and family and anybody that wants protection is inside
2440080	2444080	and I'm just out there and it's just a big, heavy piece of wood
2444080	2445080	and I'm just going...
2445080	2451080	And just screaming at them.
2453080	2454080	I'll wrap it in barbed wire.
2454080	2456080	That was what was flawed about that image.
2458080	2461080	I'm so glad I came to San Francisco tonight.
2461080	2465080	I'm going back home knowing how to make the system work.
2465080	2467080	You also got to go...
2467080	2470080	You should invest in some football shoulder pads
2470080	2471080	and put, like, spikes on them.
2471080	2475080	I think you guys are focused on the wrong part of this plan.
2475080	2477080	I'm going to say it if you want to.
2477080	2479080	I will do those things.
2479080	2481080	I promise I will.
2481080	2483080	They sound like good ideas.
2483080	2484080	I'm just mean...
2484080	2486080	I'm answering my own question first and saying,
2486080	2488080	that is where I see this ending.
2488080	2490080	I don't see any other way.
2490080	2492080	I don't see...
2492080	2495080	If you can't say...
2495080	2500080	If NBC and SNL can't say,
2500080	2507080	okay, she made a mistake in her private fucking life on her Twitter...
2507080	2511080	But here's the thing about comedy, which is what we do
2511080	2515080	and which is what we've been doing throughout many decades
2515080	2518080	and many presidents and all your little foopy dupes
2518080	2520080	of all your little cultural things.
2520080	2521080	We sell comedy.
2521080	2523080	Comedy is an ugly business.
2523080	2525080	It's a lot like coal or diamonds.
2525080	2527080	It causes bad shit to happen.
2527080	2533080	It's covered in blood, but it's worth money.
2533080	2537080	And we don't have to be political to hold the line at comedy,
2537080	2540080	to hold the line at the First Amendment and say,
2540080	2543080	I don't care who enters that shitty fucking gaudy,
2543080	2545080	neo-classist fucking house.
2545080	2548080	We will be over here at Rockefeller Center
2549080	2553080	indulging in our privilege as an institutional fucking variety show
2553080	2557080	that has defined comedy for 50 fucking years.
2557080	2560080	That is fucking crazy when that line falls.
2560080	2562080	I don't know when the last time it has,
2562080	2565080	except like firing Norm for joking about OJ.
2565080	2569080	But if you can't just say,
2569080	2571080	don't fucking...
2571080	2574080	She was suspended. She apologized.
2574080	2576080	Cool it or watch a different show.
2576080	2579080	I have a billion dollars.
2579080	2581080	Something scary is happening.
2581080	2583080	Why did I bring that up?
2583080	2585080	Things are so weird in this world right now.
2585080	2588080	Things are so topsy-turvy that you just stood up for NBC.
2592080	2595080	No, I didn't.
2595080	2597080	I thought you were saying that they were the good guys.
2597080	2600080	No, NBC created Donald Trump as it turns out.
2600080	2602080	For the first time in my life,
2602080	2604080	I feel great about being fired.
2605080	2607080	That was Sony, whatever.
2607080	2609080	None of that matters.
2609080	2612080	The corporations aren't going to be here for us.
2612080	2614080	This is beyond...
2614080	2616080	Some people my age might remember
2616080	2618080	Al Gore and dangling chads.
2618080	2620080	A nation in crisis.
2620080	2622080	Most of us remember Obama getting inaugurated
2622080	2624080	and a bunch of those guys going,
2624080	2626080	he's a secret Muslim.
2626080	2628080	Put his head on a plate.
2628080	2629080	Nothing has ever happened.
2629080	2630080	This is Animal Farm.
2630080	2632080	This is Orwellian.
2632080	2634080	This is fucking different, man.
2634080	2638080	National Park Service is going rogue.
2638080	2641080	The earth is getting warmer.
2641080	2644080	Everything is weird.
2644080	2647080	So where do you see it going?
2650080	2653080	We have a guest who's been waiting for a while.
2655080	2656080	Backstage.
2656080	2658080	I think it's right on time to bring our guests out.
2658080	2661080	If it's right on time, can we be two minutes late?
2661080	2663080	It's not right on time.
2663080	2665080	It's later than that.
2665080	2667080	It's one minute shy.
2667080	2669080	I set an alarm before we came on stage.
2669080	2672080	Tell us, Spencer, how you see this playing out.
2672080	2674080	You have 45 seconds.
2674080	2677080	You're afraid to tell us because you're going to go fucking Hulk.
2679080	2683080	The Republicans are going to have to face a crisis.
2683080	2686080	They're already starting to think about it.
2686080	2689080	They're going to say, are we going to get in line or are we not?
2689080	2693080	What happens, no matter what they decide, that's going to lead to something really bad,
2693080	2696080	like the equivalent of burning down the Reichstag or whatever.
2696080	2699080	I think that's absolutely going to happen.
2699080	2704080	How it plays out is going to determine whether or not we devolve into civil war,
2704080	2707080	whether or not we pick up the pieces and keep moving forward.
2707080	2710080	I think that something crazy like that is absolutely going to happen,
2710080	2712080	but like how it turns out.
2712080	2716080	I think it's a bad sign that Trump just recently said that he's going to build a Reichstag.
2717080	2720080	All made out of wood, like a very flammable.
2720080	2722080	It's going to be so wooden.
2722080	2726080	But okay, well, can I ask, where do you see yourself in that picture?
2726080	2729080	You know, I'm making Harmon Quest.
2736080	2739080	Even while I'm with the two by four?
2739080	2741080	Well, that was insulting, man.
2741080	2743080	You think you're going to be out there with a two by four?
2743080	2746080	I'm going to have sandbags fucking everywhere, turrets.
2746080	2748080	It'll be great.
2750080	2752080	He's going to be giving classes at the local public.
2752080	2756080	You think that I'm not going to take charge of apocalyptic scenarios?
2761080	2764080	This is all we're asking. It's all we want to hear.
2764080	2765080	Yeah, man.
2765080	2772080	Spencer, can you stand up and show us physically how you would fight off an attack by a bunch of Republican senators
2772080	2775080	who are trying to close down the EPA?
2775080	2779080	So you lay down with a towel over your head.
2779080	2782080	You put a bunch of Cheetos out.
2782080	2784080	All right, well, okay.
2784080	2788080	Now, Jeff, where do you see yourself in the apocalypse?
2788080	2790080	What's going to happen?
2790080	2791080	I got the two by four.
2791080	2794080	Spencer apparently has sandbags and a turret.
2794080	2797080	We'll all get us guns before then, I promise.
2797080	2801080	I think it might actually get to the point of physical revolts.
2802080	2805080	Let's strum the Bastille and shit like that.
2805080	2808080	But I think we are going to have to...
2808080	2813080	I think he's going to start declaring martial law and shit like he's doing in various cities or he wants to.
2813080	2814080	I think it actually...
2814080	2817080	The Women's March was one of the most inspiring things I've ever, ever seen.
2817080	2819080	I got to be a part of the L.A. one.
2820080	2822080	Based on the results of that guy...
2823080	2825080	It was awesome.
2825080	2827080	The LAPD didn't do anything.
2827080	2830080	They just stood there and smiled because everybody was being fucking cool.
2830080	2833080	And it was a million people and we couldn't fucking go anywhere.
2833080	2835080	Because we're like, why aren't we marching?
2835080	2838080	We've been here for an hour and a half and we're supposed to go to City Hall.
2838080	2840080	We're in Pershing Square and we're like, what the fuck?
2840080	2842080	That was the best part in all these cities.
2842080	2845080	People had to come out and go, thank you for coming.
2845080	2847080	I know you showed up for a march.
2847080	2849080	There's so many of you.
2849080	2850080	It's a rally.
2850080	2851080	You can't march.
2851080	2853080	You're already where you were marching.
2854080	2859080	But it was like, the worst you saw, the worst thing you saw was like people were bumping in.
2859080	2862080	I have big feet, tall guy, gilt them in everybody's way.
2862080	2863080	And I feel like...
2863080	2868080	I'm not that claustrophobic, but everybody was so kind and so cool.
2868080	2871080	And there were little girls on their mother's or father's shoulders.
2871080	2874080	And it was fucking groovy.
2874080	2876080	It was really, really, really, really good.
2876080	2877080	And you've never seen that many people get along.
2877080	2880080	And the next morning, totally clean.
2880080	2881080	Everybody fucking cleaned it up.
2881080	2885080	Somebody pointed out in the comment, because everybody has to comment on when you say that was the best.
2885080	2890080	Somebody has to inadvertently or inadvertently diminish it.
2890080	2893080	It was like, yeah, because it was all white people.
2893080	2895080	It was like, no, because it was fucking women, man.
2895080	2897080	Like, that's why it was cool.
2897080	2901080	Oh, you mean that guy was going like, chalkboard up for the white race.
2901080	2903080	No, no, no.
2903080	2910080	He or she, I'm assuming he was saying like, yes, if it was 750,000 black men in the streets of Los Angeles,
2910080	2912080	would there have been the National Guard out there?
2912080	2913080	Probably, yes.
2914080	2915080	Oh, yeah.
2915080	2916080	That's why there wasn't, like, heads knocked around.
2916080	2917080	Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
2917080	2919080	But it made me important.
2919080	2920080	Yeah, it's hard to know.
2920080	2922080	It's like, what is your instinct when you are saying that stuff?
2922080	2925080	I'm dealing with a lot of that work, because I feel like that's a kindred spirit.
2925080	2929080	It's like, well, are you kind of like, are you kind of spectra-ming here?
2929080	2934080	Is this like sort of like you, like people that say like, oh, unfortunately, this won't do anything,
2934080	2937080	because here's a photo of all these people protesting Hitler.
2937080	2938080	And then look what happened.
2938080	2945080	It's like this instinct that people that are on our side have to equivocate,
2945080	2947080	because they want to feel safe.
2947080	2952080	Somebody, one that really bummed me out is, I said, like, MVP awards to the people that cleaned up,
2952080	2955080	like, perfectly, like, downtown LA was spic and span the next morning,
2955080	2959080	and to the LAPD, which is not my favorite organization in history,
2959080	2963080	because they've been fucking mad at times.
2963080	2969080	They were groovy and didn't have a giant police presence, and there was no arrest made.
2969080	2971080	I don't think in D.C. either, right?
2971080	2972080	There's your alarm.
2972080	2974080	That's my alarm for my guests.
2974080	2979080	But somebody said, like, some woman on my, like, I think commented,
2979080	2983080	like, oh, it's nice to see that protests can be peaceful, too.
2983080	2986080	Like, protests are fucking peaceful.
2986080	2987080	Riots are fucking violent.
2987080	2992080	Like, the idea that we live in a world where, like, protesting might be bad,
2992080	2995080	just by definition, is really, really, really, really fucked up.
2995080	2997080	My favorite comment on the...
3004080	3006080	My favorite comment during the women's march.
3006080	3011080	I was sitting at LAX, and the real triumph is that I was sitting at an international terminal,
3011080	3014080	and everyone that was looking at the screen, you don't know who they voted for,
3014080	3017080	but everyone was going, holy shit.
3017080	3019080	That's the reaction we have to get every time.
3019080	3021080	People are going, Jesus Christ.
3021080	3022080	And none more so than Trump.
3022080	3024080	He fucking lost his fucking cool life.
3024080	3025080	Holy shit.
3025080	3028080	Like, human flesh scraping buildings.
3028080	3031080	It's because they're just poured into the street.
3031080	3032080	Let's bring out our guests.
3032080	3033080	We must know.
3033080	3034080	No, fuck that guy.
3034080	3035080	Fuck that guy.
3038080	3039080	I'm going to fuck him.
3041080	3042080	I just want to share my...
3043080	3045080	Because I want to be thinking about it.
3045080	3047080	There's like one tweet, and somebody was like...
3047080	3049080	All the statistics as it was popping up.
3049080	3053080	Popcorn was like, all these journalists going, holy shit, there's 150,000,
3053080	3056080	there's 200,000, everyone's tweeting these things.
3056080	3061080	And there was this woman who, she was doing it to everybody,
3061080	3068080	but she was responding and saying, I just wish the aborted women could march too.
3073080	3075080	And then the funniest guy's response was,
3075080	3077080	that's someone you don't trust with a genie.
3085080	3086080	That's how we have to win.
3086080	3088080	We have to be funnier than them.
3088080	3090080	If we can't be funnier, we have to be smarter.
3090080	3092080	If we can't be smarter, we have to be cooler.
3092080	3094080	If we can't be any of those things, we just have to be honest.
3094080	3097080	We just have to say, I want to do whatever the fuck I want to do.
3097080	3098080	How's that sound?
3098080	3101080	I have an English friend, she's like a...
3101080	3103080	I won't drop her name, she's like a...
3103080	3105080	Do you have a guest?
3110080	3112080	A disabled guest, by the way.
3112080	3116080	Well, I've been trying to bring him out for fucking 15 minutes, Jack.
3116080	3118080	Let's bring our guest out.
3121080	3122080	No, you know what?
3122080	3124080	No, finish what you were saying.
3124080	3126080	Michael, get the fuck back...
3127080	3129080	Michael Christian, everybody.
3141080	3142080	And Christian, everybody.
3142080	3144080	Christian, who will be...
3147080	3148080	All right.
3148080	3149080	All secure.
3151080	3152080	You feel good there?
3152080	3154080	The light's hitting you good?
3154080	3155080	Yeah.
3155080	3161080	Christian's going to do a better job hearing and saying what you're saying.
3161080	3163080	So, thanks for coming back.
3163080	3168080	We had you on the outside lands last time we were in the Bay Area and...
3170080	3173080	The podcast was like lost to the ages.
3173080	3176080	There was like a weird...
3176080	3177080	We lost it.
3177080	3178080	It was...
3178080	3180080	Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
3180080	3181080	Yeah.
3182080	3188080	And so losing it, we lost your promotion for your charity, Friends for Benefits.
3193080	3194080	You want to take it from here?
3194080	3195080	Yeah, sure.
3195080	3200080	So, when we went to outside lands, we were also promoting for an event that we did centered
3200080	3207080	around a cartoon show in Anakolodian called Avatar, The Last Airbender and Korra.
3208080	3210080	We had Janet Varney.
3210080	3214080	We had Dante Bosco, who was there.
3214080	3218080	We also had some of the names.
3218080	3219080	Oh, goodness.
3219080	3220080	I can't forget.
3220080	3223080	Mindy Sterling, who is the sweetest lady I've ever met.
3223080	3224080	Oh my goodness.
3224080	3225080	And she loves dogs.
3225080	3227080	And John Michael Higgins.
3227080	3229080	He is also just a blast to be with.
3229080	3233080	And even though we weren't able to be on the podcast, it didn't go out.
3233080	3235080	The event was extremely successful.
3235080	3237080	We had over 300 people there.
3237080	3239080	And so, yeah, it was great.
3239080	3241080	I mean, the venue was great.
3241080	3244080	And just everything went amazing.
3244080	3247080	And actually, before I get started with anything Michael wanted me to let you know,
3247080	3249080	that he heard you say, F that guy.
3249080	3250080	Yeah.
3250080	3252080	And he was wondering when and where.
3254080	3257080	Room 402 at the Memorial Marines Hotel.
3258080	3263080	But in all seriousness, we really just, we're very thankful for you letting us be on here
3263080	3264080	for the third time.
3264080	3267080	And we actually brought some shirts for you guys.
3267080	3270080	There's my alcoholism that bad.
3270080	3271080	Just go with it.
3271080	3272080	Just go with it.
3272080	3273080	What was the second time?
3273080	3274080	No, I think it's two times.
3274080	3275080	Okay.
3276080	3277080	Fuck you, Christian.
3278080	3281080	You made them wait so long, it felt like three times.
3282080	3284080	Just got new shirts for our nonprofit.
3287080	3289080	We just got shirts for the nonprofit.
3289080	3290080	All right.
3290080	3291080	Great.
3291080	3292080	Fantastic.
3292080	3293080	All right.
3293080	3294080	Thanks, man.
3294080	3299080	All the money goes to Kellyanne Conway's 2020 bid for President of the United States.
3300080	3304080	But yeah, we really just wanted to show that as just a token of our appreciation for everything
3304080	3305080	that you've done for us, man.
3305080	3306080	Awesome.
3306080	3307080	Thank you, man.
3307080	3308080	Really thank you.
3308080	3310080	You can buy the shirts on FriendsForBenefits.org.
3310080	3313080	The shirts are on the website.
3313080	3315080	It's on the shirts.
3320080	3321080	Yeah.
3321080	3322080	These cords are.
3323080	3329080	They will be available next week online on our website, FriendsForBenefits.org.
3329080	3332080	And I noticed that you have a KettleOne vodka here.
3332080	3333080	Yeah.
3333080	3335080	We actually have a barrel girl.
3335080	3339080	She, so as you see on the shirt, we have a barrel girl.
3339080	3341080	We're working on getting a barrel guy maybe someday in the future.
3341080	3347080	But it's, I'm not a historian, but the barrel represents sometime in the early 20th century
3347080	3353080	where people were just so poor that the only thing that they could afford was a barrel.
3353080	3355080	And we just kind of made fun with it.
3355080	3360080	And we use that as kind of like our mascot for our Friends For Benefits team.
3360080	3363080	And we actually brought our barrel girl here today.
3363080	3365080	She's here to present a gift for you.
3365080	3366080	All right.
3371080	3372080	Thank you, barrel girl.
3372080	3373080	Hello.
3373080	3374080	Thank you.
3374080	3375080	Thank you.
3376080	3378080	Everybody, this is Daniella.
3378080	3379080	This is Daniella.
3379080	3381080	She's our barrel girl that you see at every event.
3381080	3383080	She is a better barrel.
3383080	3384080	It is a better barrel, yes.
3384080	3386080	She is just fantastic.
3386080	3387080	Grab a mic, you know.
3387080	3388080	Grab a mic.
3390080	3396080	Barrel girl, is it better to be objectified by a charitable foundation?
3400080	3402080	Than by private sector?
3402080	3408080	Considering I've been objectified in ways that were not so charitable, I think this is a step up.
3408080	3411080	And also I'm a graduate student, so I kind of do anything.
3411080	3412080	Right.
3412080	3413080	Okay.
3413080	3414080	Nothing new.
3414080	3418080	You've been wearing a veritable barrel for at least eight years.
3418080	3420080	She has a degree in coopery.
3423080	3424080	All right.
3424080	3425080	Fantastic.
3425080	3427080	She might have been staves.
3427080	3430080	Is that the business out of the way?
3430080	3431080	I want to make sure.
3431080	3434080	Friends for Benefits, like it's a...
3434080	3436080	Friends for Benefits, sorry.
3439080	3440080	Bring the car around.
3440080	3441080	We organize...
3443080	3444080	Sick of this bullshit.
3445080	3453080	We organize events for other nonprofits, and we also raise money for other nonprofits.
3453080	3457080	And mostly all of our events are here in San Francisco in the city.
3458080	3459080	We're going to need...
3459080	3461080	This is where it gets rough.
3461080	3466080	We're in the midst of a federal funding blackout.
3470080	3472080	This is more than you need on your shoulders, Michael.
3472080	3474080	You don't need to answer this.
3474080	3479080	So if we take up the slack when they...
3479080	3481080	Because let me start from one position.
3481080	3486080	You personally, if you don't mind answering, if I'm prying too much, you can say,
3487080	3492080	how much of your care is federal?
3497080	3499080	Something like half.
3499080	3503080	And the other half is just through your barrel girl's service.
3507080	3509080	Through the state of California.
3510080	3512080	And are there early...
3512080	3515080	Are you part of communities that are...
3516080	3518080	He said, oh, you're going to...
3519080	3520080	He is?
3521080	3523080	Oh, he said Trump is going to...
3523080	3525080	Excuse my language, fuck him over.
3525080	3526080	Right.
3526080	3528080	I mean, we could guess that easily, but rather...
3530080	3531080	I mean, I don't even know why...
3531080	3533080	I might as well just say he's going to kill Big Bird.
3533080	3534080	I'm going to be right.
3534080	3536080	I don't know why he would be like, well, hold on a second.
3536080	3537080	Let's wait and give him a chance.
3537080	3542080	Trump might come out and go, I want to build a wall
3542080	3547080	and put Mexicans in boxcars and invade Chicago,
3547080	3550080	but I got a soft spot for Michael Christian.
3550080	3551080	He's not going to do that.
3551080	3553080	He's going to fuck everybody.
3556080	3558080	He's already made fun of disabled people.
3558080	3559080	Well, yeah, he already has.
3563080	3564080	Not to get too distracted,
3564080	3567080	but you realize that there's like a...
3567080	3568080	They have a whole thing where they're like,
3568080	3572080	yeah, he wasn't actually making fun of that disabled reporter.
3572080	3573080	Yeah, we've seen that.
3573080	3577080	I watched the video and their justification for it
3577080	3579080	is that sometimes he goes like this when he's talking.
3579080	3582080	And I'm not naked in a barrel in front of an audience.
3582080	3583080	We saw it.
3584080	3587080	At a certain point, you're allowed to say,
3587080	3589080	I'm sorry, I'm a human being.
3589080	3592080	I'm the thing that measures when you're making fun of somebody.
3592080	3593080	I saw it.
3593080	3594080	We all saw it.
3595080	3597080	What am I trying to do to get a medal?
3597080	3600080	I just was curious.
3600080	3601080	It would have just been weird if you had said,
3601080	3606080	well, actually, that reporter is kind of a fuck wad
3606080	3608080	and he always goes like this when he talks.
3610080	3612080	But yeah, that blows my mind.
3612080	3614080	The thing that blows my mind about it, of course,
3614080	3618080	is that underneath that backpedal
3618080	3621080	is their acknowledgement that it would be bad
3621080	3622080	if he did that.
3624080	3628080	Doesn't that mean that this should all just stop
3628080	3630080	if they know that that's bad?
3631080	3635080	It's a rhetorical question, but he leaned in,
3635080	3636080	so I didn't know it.
3636080	3638080	Well, I have an answer for that.
3638080	3641080	Every day we are going out to events, not every day,
3641080	3643080	but a lot of times we're going out to events
3643080	3645080	and we come around the city and no matter what,
3645080	3647080	there's always going to be people staring.
3647080	3649080	There's always going to be people who don't understand.
3650080	3654080	But when you have somebody who looks awesome,
3654080	3657080	but when you have somebody who's put in such a leadership role
3657080	3659080	who represents the United States
3659080	3661080	and is saying stuff like that,
3661080	3665080	it gives you license to stare or not stare.
3665080	3668080	To me, it seems like the tyranny is actually the not staring.
3668080	3672080	That's what I cop to is when I sense
3672080	3674080	that there's a differently abled person in the room
3674080	3676080	because I have no idea.
3676080	3678080	Am I allowed to shake their hand?
3678080	3680080	You can't.
3683080	3686080	You can also say disabled,
3686080	3688080	but when it comes to shaking hands...
3688080	3690080	Can I say differently abled?
3690080	3693080	It's just eight years of PC fucking Nazis, I'm sorry.
3693080	3695080	Let's get real.
3698080	3699080	Well, whatever.
3699080	3700080	I'm babbling.
3700080	3701080	It doesn't matter.
3701080	3704080	But I think the idea is that...
3704080	3705080	It's 9-11.
3705080	3706080	It's 9-11.
3706080	3713080	I love you, San Francisco.
3713080	3716080	When they come for this podcast,
3716080	3719080	they're not going to have difficulty.
3719080	3723080	When Trump said there was a bunch of Syrian refugees
3723080	3725080	cheering 9-11 one and a half...
3725080	3727080	No, that's every Sunday.
3727080	3730080	That's our show every Sunday.
3730080	3731080	When he makes that case,
3731080	3734080	when Bannon said the media is the opposition party,
3734080	3736080	it's like, well...
3736080	3738080	Yeah, anyways...
3738080	3740080	We're going to prison.
3740080	3742080	We're actually going to be shipped away
3742080	3744080	and terrible things are going to happen.
3744080	3745080	Yeah.
3745080	3747080	I'd rather die.
3747080	3749080	I don't want to go to prison.
3749080	3750080	I want to die.
3750080	3752080	I want to be like Steve McQueen and Papillon.
3752080	3755080	I want to eat bugs and fucking be super badass and speak.
3755080	3757080	I want to be in a time-life photo,
3757080	3760080	like fucking wheeling Michael Christian down the street
3760080	3763080	with fucking tear gas canisters behind us
3763080	3766080	and then just back of my head is getting blown off,
3766080	3770080	but I managed to wheel Michael to the fucking van
3770080	3773080	and then Michael's got fucking C4 all over him
3773080	3781080	and just rings the bell and fucking breaks bad.
3781080	3784080	I don't want to suck you into this.
3784080	3790080	You may have voted Republican.
3790080	3797080	You don't need to be out in the streets with me when we die.
3797080	3798080	Before we go any further,
3798080	3800080	I want to go ahead and excuse the barrel girl
3800080	3804080	so that she can get changed.
3804080	3806080	I love that we have a woman on stage,
3806080	3810080	but she has to wear an old-timey barrel around us.
3810080	3812080	I think that's the first time people cheer for me
3812080	3815080	about to put clothes on.
3815080	3817080	What was barrel girl's name?
3817080	3818080	Daniella.
3818080	3819080	Daniella.
3819080	3828080	She's a human being, barrel girl.
3828080	3830080	I thought maybe the barrel, I was like,
3830080	3833080	well, she could just pee, right, any time she wants.
3833080	3836080	She's got a million peas before it becomes a problem,
3836080	3840080	but then I noticed there's pants underneath.
3840080	3842080	It's not a real barrel.
3842080	3844080	That logic doesn't hold up.
3844080	3847080	How could her legs work in a closed system
3847080	3849080	coming out the bottom of a barrel?
3849080	3851080	Like gaskets?
3851080	3854080	It's kind of funny that tradition of dressing women is things,
3854080	3857080	like a pack of cigarettes or a corn cob or something.
3857080	3859080	But it's just like, I always thought,
3859080	3861080	because of my particular fetishes,
3861080	3863080	I was like, well, you know, they're wearing tights.
3863080	3865080	That's all it is.
3865080	3871080	Of course corn looks good now.
3871080	3874080	If you want to prove corn is sexual,
3874080	3876080	you can put your legs inside.
3876080	3879080	You actually saw for real a woman dressed as corn.
3879080	3881080	I've seen a woman dressed as everything.
3881080	3882080	I'm 44.
3882080	3888080	Have you guys seen, did you guys know that there's,
3888080	3889080	have we talked about this?
3889080	3894080	There's fart, I'm not judging if you're into this at all.
3894080	3897080	You sadly sent me a link to this.
3897080	3899080	I do know.
3899080	3901080	I feel like we talked about this.
3901080	3906080	Steve's just been sending us random news links during the show,
3906080	3910080	just like samurais killed themselves with seppuku.
3910080	3911080	Here's how they did it.
3911080	3914080	I mean, it's not an attack on Steve.
3914080	3916080	Why are your phones on during the show?
3916080	3920080	Because we have to get Michael in on time.
3920080	3922080	That's true.
3922080	3926080	There's a, I wish I could refer you to a link,
3926080	3930080	but it's like there's a, there's fart, fart fetish,
3930080	3934080	like a, like a, like a attractive women farting.
3934080	3941080	Like, and there's a, there's a video that I found.
3941080	3944080	I was looking for like tights and then that went to yoga pants
3944080	3947080	and then there was a video in like the sidebar of Pornhub
3947080	3953080	that was like, that it said like hot, hot yoga girl farts in her.
3953080	3954080	And I was like, farts?
3954080	3955080	Is that a typo?
3955080	3957080	And then I clicked on it and then she was like doing yoga
3957080	3958080	and then she was farting.
3958080	3959080	And I was like, wait a minute.
3959080	3961080	And then the related videos, I was like, holy shit.
3961080	3963080	Like, there goes my Saturday.
3963080	3968080	And, and one of them was amazing.
3968080	3972080	Like, I, I, I, like, like, like, like this girl is just like,
3972080	3977080	you fall in love with her because she's like, she, she's farting all over you.
3977080	3981080	She's fart, she's, she's into farting, but then she's also, what's that?
3981080	3982080	Kink shamed.
3982080	3983080	Kink shamed?
3983080	3984080	Yes.
3984080	3985080	I'm not kink shamed.
3985080	3986080	It's not really relevant.
3986080	3988080	You're kink shaming me?
3988080	3989080	I'm kink shaming you.
3989080	3994080	You're a, you're a, you're a, you're a yell out-outerist.
3994080	3997080	Wait, didn't I just give you a t-shirt?
3997080	3998080	I just gave her the t-shirt.
3998080	4002080	You have, you have yell out-ophilia.
4002080	4003080	Okay.
4003080	4004080	All right.
4004080	4005080	Well, the, the, the.
4005080	4006080	Are you from Brisbane?
4006080	4008080	Yeah.
4008080	4011080	I like that hat.
4011080	4013080	Be right with you, Michael.
4013080	4019080	This, this, this, this young lady, she, she, she, one of her videos was she's dressed
4019080	4020080	as Harley Quinn.
4020080	4024080	And I mean, she's really dressed as Harley Quinn, like she's committed to the costume.
4024080	4025080	Which one?
4025080	4026080	The movie or the original?
4026080	4027080	Not, not Suicide Squad.
4027080	4028080	Okay.
4028080	4029080	Okay.
4029080	4030080	Sure.
4030080	4035080	Like the way you would, like a cosplay Harley Quinn costume, like with like leather, kind
4035080	4040080	of like skin-tight leather, but like, and, and, but she, and she, but she's doing the
4040080	4041080	voice.
4041080	4044840	And she's like, and she's not, she didn't like look up Harley Quinn on Wikipedia.
4044840	4046960	She's so fucking into the mythology.
4046960	4053800	Like she's like, Hey, Mr. B. Oh boy, I got, I got, oh, I could fill a stadium with what
4053800	4058600	I got inside of me.
4058600	4059600	It's amazing.
4059600	4065240	Like she's talking to you and you're Batman and she has you tied up and she's explaining
4065240	4066240	how she's going to fart.
4066240	4073240	She's like, I had some sauerkraut and Mr. J couldn't handle it either.
4073240	4076880	And then she just starts farting.
4076880	4084920	You will want to marry this woman because of just her soul, like it doesn't matter what
4084920	4085920	you're into.
4085920	4089400	I don't want to marry a professional fart lady.
4089400	4092700	Literally half of the people in this room are in a relationship with somebody whose
4092700	4098260	particulars aren't necessarily their jam, but make them so happy because they meet them
4098260	4099260	halfway.
4099260	4100260	And it's fun.
4100260	4101260	I mean, okay.
4101260	4102260	All right.
4102260	4107300	Now you like it because, because, because you're here with someone that's meeting you
4107300	4110140	way more than halfway.
4110140	4120900	Now you're, she's, she's like, yeah, yes, I love shitting on Natalie in a hot tub.
4120900	4124740	That was the lamest like riff of like what a kid could be, shitting on Natalie in a hot
4124740	4125740	tub.
4125740	4127740	That's the name of the episode.
4127740	4129740	All right.
4129740	4130740	Hi, Michael.
4130740	4131740	How are you?
4131740	4132740	Fantastic.
4132740	4133740	He's good.
4133740	4134740	He's good.
4134740	4135740	I love that.
4135740	4136740	I love the eyebrows.
4136740	4141580	Like your, your, your eyebrows, whenever I speak to you, like you're, you're like, what
4141580	4148060	is, are you, is there like, like, what is, is it a, at this point, like, is it a, are
4148060	4150780	you indicating like, what, what are you doing?
4150780	4159140	When you're like, like shooting your eyebrows up and down, you can't really tilt his head.
4159140	4160140	Welcome back.
4160140	4163060	He can't, he can't tilt his head.
4163060	4166060	And so I've been with, I've been working for Michael for two years now and I've figured
4166060	4169580	out that if it's like, I can't even move my eyebrows like he can, but when he does it
4169580	4175340	multiple times, it's a I'm good or it's a yes, it's like, it's like, it's like a thumbs
4175340	4176340	up a head.
4176340	4177340	Yeah.
4177340	4178340	Yeah.
4178380	4182880	Your condition has divested you of the 85 ways that we all have of letting somebody
4182880	4187300	know that you're responding, like matching an emotional bid of any kind.
4187300	4189180	Like going like, yeah, I'm listening.
4189180	4192140	Like we go, uh-huh, or like, we take it for granted.
4192140	4196380	Like we just sit and fuck with our phone and like, but cause we can like, yeah, like kind
4196380	4197380	of go, uh-huh.
4197380	4203260	And, and you're like, you, you, you, you have to like, and it's a, but it's also, you're,
4203260	4206100	you're lucky because that that's adorable.
4206100	4210500	Like, like, like, like, like going like that is like also a way of saying like, I'm into
4210500	4211500	you.
4211500	4213780	That's what it means.
4213780	4215620	And I think what everybody wants to hear.
4215620	4217860	I always feel like when he does it to me, he's coming on to me.
4217860	4218860	I have to.
4218860	4222420	The first time I met him and then he told me to get in the barrel and then started wiggling,
4222420	4229660	wiggling at eyebrows, I was like, yeah, when he's, when he's explaining the measurements
4229660	4235860	of the barrel costume and in between every, he's like, it's like identical to Bob Guccione
4236100	4238700	You look like a 24 24 24.
4241420	4242020	All right.
4242020	4246580	So I don't know what like, uh, Michael, what would you think about hanging out and like
4246580	4251260	playing a little ad hoc Jerry rigged a D and D adventure with us?
4253620	4256260	We're bringing it back, bringing the shit back.
4256740	4261220	What if he was like, what if he, what if he went like, and then, and then Christian went
4261220	4263220	like, and he's like, fuck off.
4263220	4266820	And then you just like wheeled out peace.
4268620	4268980	All right.
4268980	4269500	Well, cool.
4269500	4273580	So Christian, you'll stay out and help like, like Michael play a D and D with us.
4273580	4274740	And, uh, okay.
4274740	4275220	We're great.
4275220	4276140	We don't have character sheets.
4276140	4276820	We don't have characters.
4276820	4279980	We're going to first, the first order of business is we got to pick characters.
4279980	4281300	We got to figure out who we want to be.
4282340	4283580	Spencer, you down with this?
4283780	4289100	I know I can believe it's fine.
4289100	4290180	You guys can handle it.
4290980	4293780	We're not starting a new campaign necessarily.
4293780	4298020	We're just doing kind of a one off, San Francisco collector's edition.
4298100	4298460	All right.
4300540	4304500	Spencer, do you want to assign us, uh, not come up with them.
4304540	4306620	Someone, someone pitched me something.
4306740	4307340	It'll be great.
4307340	4308060	Then you start.
4308140	4312620	I like, I always like being like, uh, well, Michael, I'll give you your first choice.
4312620	4315740	Like in the kind of archetypes, you want to be like a healer or a fighter or whatever.
4315740	4316500	Like you, you.
4317860	4318900	Necromancer, right?
4318940	4319340	Yes.
4319340	4319820	Yes.
4319860	4320460	Okay, great.
4320820	4322780	So like race, do you know your race?
4325100	4325860	Okay, great man.
4326100	4326460	Awesome.
4326660	4326940	Oh, what?
4326940	4329620	Necro human human necromancer.
4329740	4330220	I love it.
4330260	4330780	All right.
4330900	4331940	What's your name, Michael?
4335900	4337980	Uh, he has no idea.
4337980	4340260	You can think about it for a bit.
4340260	4340700	Yeah, I think about it.
4340700	4341580	Well, we'll get there over there.
4341580	4343700	Ruminate on your on your character's name for a moment.
4343700	4344140	Dan.
4344460	4346660	Uh, Michael, do you get drunk?
4346660	4347380	Do you want to drink?
4348820	4349180	Yeah.
4349300	4352260	Do you need, you need a straw to, to, to, to get shitfaced?
4352940	4356140	Actually, everything it takes is through a G tube.
4356180	4360780	And so, yeah, I would need to put my hands down in order to do that.
4361140	4363100	Wait, you have to put your hands down.
4363860	4365260	I mean, I'd have to put the microphone down.
4365260	4366140	Oh, I see.
4367540	4368300	Oh, the G tube.
4368300	4371180	You, you have to, you, you help him drink.
4371180	4371580	Okay.
4374460	4375340	I will not wait.
4375340	4375620	You will.
4375620	4377140	You take my, take my mic stand.
4377140	4377980	I'll hold the mic.
4377980	4378860	You do the G tube.
4378940	4380220	Okay, that'd be great.
4380260	4380900	That'd be great.
4381300	4384020	But if you can give me one second, I got to go grab his bag.
4384300	4384860	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4384860	4386300	We have to make up our characters.
4386300	4387420	Danielle, would you like a cocktail?
4389100	4389940	Are you seriously?
4389940	4391220	In the meantime, would you like a vodka?
4391220	4391580	Yes.
4394340	4395740	Wouldn't you, after being in a barrel?
4397180	4397460	Okay.
4397460	4400460	Now that, now that Christian's gone, like fucking like, let's,
4402100	4405340	what, how, how, how, how much of the day do you spend with him?
4406220	4407500	Uh, six hours a day.
4407940	4410380	Uh, is he, that's not that long, six hours.
4410380	4411980	Like, like, so what time does he show up?
4413180	4414420	Typically around 5.
4414660	4418140	5 a.m., 5 p.m., p.m.
4418580	4419060	Oh, shit.
4419060	4419460	Fuck.
4425740	4426540	All right, fine.
4428380	4431620	You have a microphone on, I'm not that far behind.
4433620	4436780	He, he can hear like my Newton voices for a living.
4437020	4437460	I know.
4438420	4439340	He hears everything.
4439540	4441220	All right, so we got a human necromancer.
4441420	4443420	This is, this is mine, God dammit.
4443420	4449500	No, it, uh, uh, uh, what's easiest, do I, do you want me to fill this mixing cup
4449500	4451340	with, uh, ice and vodka?
4451380	4453860	Like do you want it cold just to room temperature?
4453860	4454400	Is that cool?
4457740	4461420	Is there anybody out there LIB in D like Pathfinder Fan?
4464180	4465780	Our barrel girl.
4465900	4466780	What was your name again?
4466780	4467300	Barrel girl.
4467300	4468140	I'm so sorry.
4468820	4471380	Daniella is a big D and D fan.
4472540	4472900	Okay.
4473340	4474780	Well, Daniella, y'all play with us.
4475060	4475340	Okay.
4475340	4480300	So I, so necromancers, what Michael's going to be, uh, I, uh, Jeff, I'm assuming
4480300	4482260	you want to be like kind of a, what you go next.
4482420	4484380	I was going to have people write down ideas for me.
4485060	4485860	Oh Jesus.
4493700	4494980	A gender or a wonder?
4496180	4497460	I don't know what a wender is.
4498660	4502100	So I'm going to be an elf secretary of education.
4502140	4502540	All right.
4506180	4506460	Quick.
4506460	4508420	Well, I'm also, I'm also a monk.
4508420	4511460	I'm an elk elf monk secretary of education.
4511460	4512620	You got to roll for funding.
4514060	4516020	Unless I get something better from these people over here.
4516940	4517740	I'll wait.
4517740	4521660	So right now you're, you're plugging vodka and some Michael, some one of Michael's
4521660	4521980	tubes.
4521980	4522580	What's going on here?
4522780	4524300	Oh, this is, yeah, we didn't know about this.
4524300	4525420	It doesn't go in his mouth.
4525420	4528500	It goes into his, your matrix umbilical point.
4528580	4529220	Oh my God.
4529220	4531380	This is the best part is he doesn't taste it.
4531380	4532540	That's also the worst part.
4532540	4533260	That's crazy.
4533900	4534900	Well, not with vodka.
4534900	4536300	God, that's pretty amazing.
4536580	4537620	Can I throw some Molly in there?
4537620	4541860	Wait, so do you just get this guy fucked up?
4541900	4544220	Wait, can I get a, I want to get a picture of this process.
4544660	4545220	Is that okay?
4545220	4546460	Is that invading your privacy?
4546500	4547980	Do you, are you okay with me taking a picture of it?
4548740	4549260	I'll show it.
4549260	4552340	You have, you have, you have, you have, you have kill rights on Instagram.
4553260	4557180	I just, it's like, we don't, we don't get to spend this kind of time on stage.
4557180	4559060	I don't think privacy is much of a concern.
4559220	4562620	Well, yeah, but this is maybe, you know, I just don't want to be an asshole on accident.
4562660	4562940	Okay.
4564780	4568660	But, but isn't that, so is that like, what do they call it?
4568660	4569300	Butt chugging?
4569300	4575540	Like, like, like, like where it's like you, like, like, do you, you, you, you, you've
4575540	4576660	done this before, right?
4576700	4577620	You know your limit.
4578940	4579340	Okay.
4579340	4584660	And it was like, but it's, it's going into your gut and in right into your stomach.
4585500	4585900	Okay.
4585940	4588420	And then as it, but that, so that's basically the same as drinking it.
4588420	4591740	It's not the same as putting it like a tampon soaked with vodka in your butt.
4599620	4601260	It takes less time to digest.
4601260	4602140	It hits you faster.
4602140	4602540	Oh my God.
4602540	4604380	He's so, he's so fucked up right now.
4605980	4607180	I've never seen you like this, Michael.
4609540	4610020	Thank you.
4610900	4612940	Uh, why, why can't you drink it, Michael?
4612940	4616380	I tell you, cause you, cause you're using your mouth to speak and, and
4624060	4624260	Okay.
4624260	4624620	Sorry.
4624820	4629980	The disease that he has makes it so that the muscles in his throat don't work anymore.
4629980	4631980	So like, like swallow swallowing doesn't work.
4632220	4633420	You can't swallow it all anymore.
4633420	4634580	Eat through the G tube too.
4635220	4635540	Correct.
4635580	4638340	You don't, you don't get to eat solid food anymore at all.
4639180	4640940	And you were, this is congenital, right?
4640940	4642260	You haven't eaten solid food.
4643900	4644420	10 years.
4645700	4647380	Well, it's, it's, it's been shitty lately.
4652020	4652380	Yes.
4652380	4655180	They just, um, they're, they approved it.
4655900	4659380	They approved this new, um, what it's called spin Raza.
4660340	4666820	And so, yeah, it's, it's $125,000 and I mean,
4669340	4672100	yes, for each shot and you need six shots.
4672660	4676900	It's basically like donating bone, bone marrow is what the shot is like too.
4677060	4678780	What the way I missed the top of that though.
4678780	4679500	What is that?
4683100	4686300	That might actually restore you to eating solid food.
4686420	4687100	Is that so?
4688420	4693020	But you have to be a Senator in order to, and then you'd be a hypocrite because
4693020	4696420	you'd be also simultaneously disapproving of, of its use.
4699180	4701100	But you'd be like smuggling it in the back door.
4703100	4705980	Like an X-Men, the guy, the jellyfish man.
4713620	4714180	All right.
4714180	4715220	So, all right.
4715220	4717180	Well, what you, what you got?
4717180	4719340	I'm going to, well, I'll be a healer because I feel like
4719340	4720620	nobody ever wants to be a healer.
4720620	4725420	So like, like, like, and I feel like tonight I have been a healer.
4729260	4736180	Yeah, I, I've also been intuitive and I know forced applause when I hear it.
4736220	4736500	Yep.
4738980	4740300	You could tell I wanted that.
4741820	4744740	It was worse than getting it organically or not getting it.
4745460	4748500	So, so you're, you're, what kind of healer was your, was your race?
4748500	4749860	Well, I'll just be like a cleric.
4749860	4751900	Like, well, you're a human necromancer.
4751900	4755300	So I'll be like, well, I know.
4755300	4756020	Don't listen to them.
4756020	4757140	Just calm down.
4758140	4759260	That's not a race.
4759460	4762700	Paladin isn't a race, no matter what the alt-right tells you.
4765020	4771300	I'll be like, like, what's a good, I'll be, I'll be a, I'll be a, I'll be a,
4771660	4773700	can I be a full on orc cleric?
4773700	4775500	No, that's not possible.
4775500	4777740	I don't know about that, man.
4777740	4778820	Oh, boy.
4778820	4780140	Yeah, no, for sure.
4780140	4783260	Yeah, I'll just be a gelatinous ooze cleric if you want.
4783580	4785980	I mean, don't, but.
4786180	4787820	Sounds like that was pretty popular.
4787820	4790540	Yeah, I'll be a gelatinous ooze cleric.
4794620	4796260	Great.
4796260	4799180	I guess you're not the only one that eats through a G-tube.
4800100	4803180	So what, what, what, come out here and try to high road everybody?
4803900	4805420	What, what, what's, what's your character?
4805420	4806020	I'm sorry.
4806020	4807820	Gelatinous cube cleric.
4807820	4811260	Gelatinous cube.
4811260	4813260	Wow, ooze.
4813260	4815940	I said ooze, I meant cube.
4815940	4817860	All right. It's a cube of ooze.
4817860	4819140	It is a cube of ooze.
4819140	4821620	It's a large size ooze, I believe.
4821620	4824100	No, it's probably huge, right?
4824100	4826740	So you're you're you're a cube of gelatin?
4826740	4828300	Yes, you're a cleric.
4828300	4829580	How big do you think?
4829580	4830300	What are the dimensions?
4830300	4832900	You're about 10 by 10 by 10, maybe 15 feet.
4833220	4836260	Yeah. Holy shit.
4836260	4838820	I'm a giant cube.
4838820	4839940	10, what do you say?
4839940	4841580	10 by 10 by 15 is not a cube.
4841580	4844100	No, 10 by 10 by 10 or 15 by 15.
4844100	4845260	Oh, OK. All right.
4845260	4847460	Do I do I speak verbally?
4847460	4852300	Do I you speak somatically using pseudopods?
4852860	4856900	So I just make myself clear, like, like, like a like a Hanna-Barbera character,
4856900	4859700	like kind of, yeah, like a rage like that.
4859700	4861860	That sand buggy.
4861860	4864900	Sign language or.
4864900	4865900	Who else we got?
4865900	4867900	Is Jeff Daniella anyone?
4867900	4870460	Daniella, what do you want to be?
4870460	4873020	Off the top of my head, maybe half teeth,
4873020	4875460	wing, dark wreck and warlock.
4876860	4877780	What was that?
4877780	4879980	The Dark Reckoner, was it?
4879980	4881380	Is that is that I like?
4881380	4882180	It's a special.
4882180	4884100	It's a specialization. Fair enough.
4884100	4886100	A half what?
4886220	4889980	Oh, it's a special, a half whatling.
4890020	4892060	Tiefling, it means I'm really horny.
4892060	4896020	A Tiefling, Tief, Tiefling, Tiefling.
4896260	4898220	A half Tiefling, what?

4899500	4900700	I'm not even going to write that down.
4900700	4902340	I will forget what that means.
4902340	4905820	Tiefling, yeah, Tiefling, dark reckoning, warlock, right?

4921700	4925180	You're so you're you're you're disruptive, but you're vulnerable.
4925180	4928660	Like you know, you know, you're not trying to cause no trouble.
4929380	4931900	You're not worried about Natalie, who keeps getting shit on
4931900	4933540	back in the hot tub.
4933540	4937140	Well, I do worry about Natalie, but I think Natalie signed up for.
4937780	4938740	What's your what's your name?
4938740	4940740	Disruptive, vulnerable lady.

4945100	4947620	And what's your name's not Natalie?
4947620	4949900	What's what's the other girl's name?

4957140	4959540	Oh, I'm going to be
4959580	4962100	I'm going to I'm going to combine pieces of what I've got here.
4962100	4964980	I want to be a
4966380	4969540	an elf druid.
4969780	4970820	OK.
4970820	4974020	Oh, and also I want my thing to be like, I want to fuck it like fire.
4974060	4977340	I want to make like, I want to be like art like an arsonist druid,
4978340	4980940	which seems like a bad thing if you like trees. Right.
4982820	4986700	But I hate I hate when people use trees to make buildings.
4986700	4988900	So I feel like that was the misuse of a tree.
4989460	4990500	They murdered my trees.
4990500	4992820	I mean, I like to burn shit down as a
4993900	4997020	we're definitely lacking in kind of like hack and slash types.
4997020	5000460	Do you want I could I could change my gelatinous cube to be more of a photo?
5000660	5001340	It's true.
5001340	5006500	The OK, the improv I came up with is really heavy on hack and slash.
5008500	5010140	Yeah, I don't know why I'm like refereeing.
5010140	5012860	Great. Yes, it's made up.
5012900	5014580	All right. Harmon, what's your character's name?
5014580	5017020	What's what's your Gerald?
5018900	5024100	Wait, do we do we get Christian a character?
5025100	5027740	You know, Christian's going to be translated for whatever a character.
5027740	5029340	Michael. OK.
5029340	5032820	And Daniela, do you have a character name for your half tiefling
5033180	5035820	sexy necromancer or whatever you are?

5037220	5039260	Kettle one. Kettle one.
5041580	5042260	And what did I say?
5042260	5046460	I wasn't a a druid, an elf druid, fire one.
5046620	5048820	My name is going to be Chad.
5054900	5058940	The fire and like her, Chad, the fire like her.
5062140	5064900	And if I don't see fucking web art tomorrow from Chad,
5064900	5067780	the fire like I've been very disappointed.
5067780	5070940	And I think Michael may be telling Christian his necromancer's name.
5073220	5074860	His name is going to be Rogue.
5074860	5077540	It's his old puppy.
5077540	5081860	Well, Ruger, Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, like Rogue One.
5082380	5083820	All right, dig it. All right.
5083820	5085940	All right, Spencer, let me find you some music.
5085940	5087660	Did you see Rogue One?
5087660	5089140	Is it good? You like it?
5089140	5090940	I'm sorry.
5094540	5097500	I just I guess I'm excited looking at the advertisements
5097500	5102060	like stormtroopers walking in beach water and stuff like fucking. Yes.
5104860	5108620	All right, Spencer, do we have it all set up?
5109180	5112140	What? Do you have dice?
5112140	5113580	So you know, no, no.
5113580	5114460	Anybody here have dice?
5114460	5116660	What was I supposed to do?
5116660	5118700	Be a game master. Oh, fuck sake.
5118700	5120860	Yeah, no, it's fine. It's all made up.
5120860	5122140	Anybody here?
5124060	5126700	We have frequently asked people for dice and they have them.
5126700	5131740	Anybody here have a plays Zane?
5132740	5136100	Trumpy Zane. Zane.
5136100	5138140	Well, these aren't dice.
5138140	5139820	These are sugar cubes.
5139820	5143180	There's some there's some more to it, but they're not sugar cubes.
5143180	5144620	Alternative dice.
5144620	5146340	I got dexterity, baby.
5146340	5147580	All right.
5147580	5150940	OK, so we have dice from Zane and some mystery gal over there.
5151500	5153740	Yeah, thank you so much for the dice, everybody.
5154700	5158540	Um, episode one,
5159780	5163300	Harry Potter and the syrup of begonias.
5166260	5170460	Our heroes find themselves in the lobby of Hogwarts Castle
5171460	5174140	searching for the syrup of begonias.
5175460	5178460	You see the sorting hat in the Great Hall.
5179260	5181460	That's all.
5183900	5189340	You're in the empty Great Hall of Hogwarts with the sorting hat.
5190860	5193100	I walk up and I put the hat on my head.
5193100	5195460	All right. I'm off the clock.
5199180	5202220	Is that the hat talking? Yeah, that's the hat.
5202220	5206020	Um, I see you're off the clock, but you're on my head.
5207580	5208540	Sure, yeah.
5208540	5211700	OK, can't really do anything. I'm just a hat.
5214380	5217340	Why did they call you a sorting hat? I sort.
5225780	5227740	Do I have eyes?
5227740	5229700	You can see.
5229700	5230940	You could you could sense.
5230940	5233060	You might have blind sense.
5233060	5235860	I sense for exits.
5235860	5238820	Oh, there's so many. There's like at least six.
5240780	5243700	But I can't talk, so I mime.
5243700	5246460	There's six exits to my compatriots.
5251060	5253900	He jiggles vigorously.
5258180	5259380	It's true.
5259380	5263100	I do I can I do like a sense magic on the sorting hat?
5263220	5264740	Oh, yeah, it's so magic.
5264740	5267620	It's an ancient artifact. All right. Great power.
5267620	5272060	I step aside with the hat on my head like I'm like, hey, like sorting hat.
5272180	5273860	What do you have a name?
5273860	5276220	Sorting hat. Yeah, OK.
5278020	5280060	Well, what's what do you like to get up to?
5280060	5283180	What's your thing? Like, do you do you like to?
5283180	5286300	You want to you want to sort some shit out right now?
5286300	5288140	No, I'm off the clock.
5288140	5290340	When do you when do you get back on duty?
5290340	5292420	Oh, this semester doesn't start for weeks.
5293940	5295700	Do I know the other?
5295700	5298460	Yeah, you guys are all questing for the syrup of begonias.
5300020	5301700	So you know each other a long time.
5301700	5304300	Oh, for as long as is handy.
5306140	5307100	Sorting hat.
5307100	5309500	Do you know where the syrup of begonias might be found?
5309540	5311940	Oh, the syrup of begonias.
5311940	5314540	That's somewhere else entirely.
5318180	5320700	They're going to need to go outside and hang a left.
5320980	5323580	All right. Can I can I continue to wear you?
5323580	5324700	You want to hang out here?
5324700	5327220	I mean, I really I don't care, man.
5327220	5328620	You don't care.
5328620	5331740	You see, like you got to get like your you kind of get life in order.
5331740	5334740	I think you have a lot of assumptions about what a hat shooter shouldn't be.
5336140	5341660	Well, I didn't have any until one talked and had a name.
5341900	5343060	Yeah, yeah.
5343060	5347100	I absorbed the hat like into my gelatin.
5348300	5349860	All right. Yeah.
5349860	5352340	It slowly begins to dissolve.
5353020	5354660	Is it screaming?
5354660	5355700	You can't tell.
5355700	5358940	It doesn't seem to be able to interface with your lack of brain.
5360860	5367180	I push it out just enough for its mouth to emerge.
5371780	5372900	Is it not screaming?
5372900	5374580	No, it's not.
5374580	5377780	I suck it back in. OK.
5377780	5382500	I gesture to the rest of the group to follow me outside and go to the left.
5382780	5384980	Really quick, Michael needs another drink.
5384980	5386540	Oh, great. I will be right here.
5386540	5387140	Dan, you're close.
5387140	5389860	Wait, well, you got you.
5389860	5392140	You got all the fixes right here, right?
5392140	5394100	Yeah. Yeah, too.
5394100	5395580	Oh, oh, I thought you were leaving.
5395580	5397540	I thought I was like, well, wait. OK.
5397540	5400340	Fuck this anymore alcohol for the listeners.
5400620	5405580	He has a pyrex or corning, whatever, like a mixing cup, measuring cup,
5405580	5407380	pouring it into a giant syringe.
5407380	5410060	All right. And I'm plunging it into some part of Michael's body.
5410060	5412460	That is a magic. I don't know what's magic.
5412460	5416100	While Christian's busy, because he's filling your G2, your matrix belly.
5416140	5419940	Do you is there anything because we're all in this like Harry Potter
5421500	5423740	commissary? Is it?
5423740	5426980	It's pissing me out, so I lay on fire.
5428260	5429860	Couldn't make it out.
5429860	5431900	He said the hat was pissing him off.
5431900	5432940	Can we light it on fire?
5432940	5435140	Oh, yeah, I'll start squirt it out.
5435140	5436300	Light it on fire.
5436300	5438660	I summon the God.
5442700	5445340	I summon the God, Pyros.
5445820	5451340	And I and I go, you had 10 chances to be a cool hat, motherfucker.
5453060	5457660	And I cast I cast a spell of flame on sorting.
5457700	5460140	This is what all hats want.
5468340	5470740	Feel like Spentress kind of giving us a free ride on this one.
5472700	5475700	I turned.
5475700	5478020	What's what's Michael's character's name?
5478020	5479420	Oh, Rogue, Rogue.
5479420	5483380	I turned to Rogue and I go, well, I I killed that hat for you.
5483380	5486260	You ready to go kick some butt?
5486260	5488100	She's waving.
5490260	5491740	I'm sensing.
5492340	5494740	I'm sensing a real fucking lack of motivation in our group.
5495580	5497980	No, I'm I'm bouncing out the door.
5497980	5500300	You're a fucking you're a blob with no brains.
5500620	5503660	Oh, whoa.
5504500	5507140	You just sucked in a hat and spit it back out.
5507300	5509500	Differently abled. Yeah, like.
5511540	5514100	I'm just saying, like, I'm like,
5515260	5518460	I don't know where we're like, what's what's the what's the motivation here
5518460	5519100	for all of us?
5519100	5522100	Like, what do we what do we want as a group to go find the syrup?
5522100	5523060	But go. Yeah.
5523060	5524740	But you guys are standing around.
5524740	5526740	You're standing around like a bunch of dogs.
5526740	5529900	Moving out the door, going out the door.
5529900	5531420	OK, let's all go out and go to the left.
5531420	5535100	Like the hat said before we I immolated it. Yeah.
5536060	5537540	You all do that.
5537540	5540060	You head outside of Hogsmeade.
5540060	5542220	It's a little village.
5542220	5543420	It's it's great.
5543420	5545780	There's little houses and little huts and stuff.
5546020	5547940	Oh, man. It's great.
5547940	5550500	Specifically, there's a big shack.
5550500	5551780	It's all messed up.
5551780	5554860	It seems to be all boarded up. Oh, fuck.
5557620	5561540	A village with a hut, also other structures.
5563780	5566180	I I I bounce around.
5566180	5567220	Yeah, my surroundings.
5567220	5571780	I think I think the smart move send the gelatinous cube into the hut first.
5572980	5574420	I don't eat the boards.
5574420	5577500	Is it? Yeah, I'll squeeze through the boards
5577500	5579980	to take a look with my non eyes.
5580220	5581700	You do that.
5581700	5583940	It's all dirty and gross.
5584220	5586900	There's soot. Oh, man, it sucks.
5589140	5592620	You see a hole near the ground on a wall.
5592740	5595580	It seems to be a space between boards.
5595980	5599660	And in that space, it looks like some sort of tunnel.
5600540	5606300	I pull my my gel out of the thing and I look at these guys and I and I go.
5606300	5615700	Oh, I mime that there's a hole.
5615700	5617260	Everything he said. Yeah.
5617260	5619980	Because I can't I can't talk. I got you. I know.
5621340	5625180	And I and then and then I just charge through the boards
5625180	5630140	and I head for the hole because I'm fearless because I'm goo.
5630180	5633020	Yeah. Well, what are the stakes?
5633100	5638620	Like a human's worst case scenario is my beginning.
5640540	5642820	Like what more is there to be scared of?
5642900	5645900	Can I ask why we're looking for the syrup of begonias?
5646180	5648140	Well, what purpose would be cool?
5648140	5650780	Who are you asking? Anybody?
5651100	5653180	OK, let's ask Spencer.
5653180	5655900	Let's ask you. Can we can we table talk that one? Oh, yeah.
5657100	5659940	You think back to when your friend Pete
5660140	5662900	asked you to get him the syrup of begonias?
5664500	5670420	He says, Pete's like, Pete's like, this is going to be so good.
5670500	5674140	These pancakes are going to be great. Just you wait.
5674780	5679620	I go, my God, I can't believe I invited you over for pancakes
5679620	5683020	without the syrup of begonias.
5683020	5685220	I turn to the group and go, oh, Jesus Christ,
5685220	5689220	you know, the big pancake thing happens at pizza in like five hours.
5689220	5690620	We got to get this syrup.
5690620	5693140	This the stakes are the stakes have never been higher.
5695740	5698180	I'm I'm doing this, having a fit.
5698980	5701260	I go down the hole. Yeah.
5701260	5703820	All right. It's a long tunnel.
5703820	5706540	Oh, man, you're squeezing and oozing.
5709220	5711380	You go for what seems like a long time,
5711380	5714460	and then you find yourself in an open space.
5714660	5716860	It's open earthen this tunnel, at least.
5717380	5722060	Looking around, you see the walls seem to be made of natural wood
5722260	5724340	or living wood.
5724340	5727660	It seems like you're inside of a giant tree.
5729540	5731740	Hey, you guys, I found another room.
5731740	5733460	They can't hear you because you can't talk.
5733460	5735300	I know. It is.
5735300	5737820	It was just a Goonies reference.
5737820	5743140	Oh, it's best left unheard.
5743140	5745260	It was a little racist.
5746260	5749620	As data was not a woke character.
5751660	5754260	He was a Japanese gadget fan.
5755620	5758660	Is the whole big enough for me, kettle one and rogue to fit through as well?
5758740	5761860	Oh, yeah, I can fit in any hole.
5762980	5764940	That's what she just said.
5766340	5769060	I didn't hear it, but not because I'm committing to my character,
5769060	5770740	because I am a bad listener.
5770740	5772380	I can't fit in any hole.
5772380	5774620	You went to golf nine holes. What?
5776100	5779380	And I think the Kettle one was getting me that quick.
5779380	5780780	I said, I can fit in any hole.
5780780	5781660	Oh, you can fit in any hole.
5781660	5783420	OK, that's what she said.
5787700	5790340	Let's let's all charge through that hole and join.
5791220	5791700	What's your name?
5791700	5794820	Jared, Gerald, Gerald.
5794820	5796260	I'm doing it.
5796260	5799180	You also find yourself within this great tree.
5799900	5802260	Oh, well, hey, guys, I'm a druid, right?
5802620	5803260	Yeah. All right.
5803260	5806820	And I I want to convene with the wood.
5806980	5810420	Do I have like a like a like a spell that I can use to kind of.
5810420	5812460	You're going to touch the wood.
5814300	5817260	That's what she said again. Yeah.
5817260	5819500	I walk up to the tree,
5819500	5823100	whether it's one of the walls and I start just touching that wood.
5824700	5827940	You you feel the pain of an ancient.
5828420	5831540	The anger and the rage,
5832100	5835140	the violence, the violence, so much violence,
5835140	5838020	both from and against the tree.
5838020	5839940	Oh, man, this tree is fucked up.
5841900	5843900	This whole this whole thing is fucked up.
5845380	5847500	Guys, we got a violent tree here.
5851740	5854580	I can't even ask you anything.
5856220	5857220	We go harder.
5857220	5859740	I thought you could communicate to some sort of weird like, yeah,
5859780	5861860	you definitely can't be the love bug horn.
5864100	5865220	I can mime stuff.
5865220	5867580	I'll just mime like,
5867580	5870140	is does the tree know anything about the syrup?
5872020	5875020	I asked the tree, do you know about the syrup of the begonias?
5875140	5879500	The tree doesn't communicate as such, but you search the trees
5880260	5882740	memory banks
5882740	5885900	and you see a cruel infestation,
5885900	5888940	a corruption seeping through the surface,
5889140	5892700	purging the wood of goodness and filling it with evil.
5893980	5897300	That seems like necromancer territory, but I can't say that.
5902500	5905100	OK, is it dead? The tree?
5907300	5908700	The stuff oozing out of it.
5908700	5912980	Oh, it's it's it's wracked with death energies.
5916580	5921180	Oh, yeah, yeah, it seems to be an undead sort of sludge
5921180	5924900	made from the souls and bodies of decomposed things
5924900	5927300	smashed to death by the tree.
5928980	5930380	Good controlling.
5931380	5935620	All right, it fails its will save and is dominated by you.
5935620	5936620	Whoo.
5936620	5937620	Whoo.
5937620	5938620	Whoo.
5938620	5939620	Whoo.
5939620	5940620	Whoo.
5940620	5941620	Whoo.
5941820	5947620	I wonder if we can turn the sludge into delicious syrup for anything.
5947620	5948820	That's what he was about to ask.
5948820	5950420	What the hell is the syrup?
5950420	5951420	Say again.
5951420	5952620	Where's the syrup?
5952620	5954420	This is the syrup.
5955020	5956620	The syrup is dead, people.
5956620	5957620	Yeah.
5957620	5959620	Who said that? Who said this is the syrup?
5959620	5962620	This this is his intuition.
5964620	5966620	I believe it's the syrup.
5966620	5968620	I believe it's the syrup.
5968620	5969620	The intuition.
5971620	5974620	I pick up on it and I mime.
5974620	5976620	This is the syrup.
5980620	5982620	We're saying we should feed it to him first.
5983620	5986620	Will we get it back if he eats it or consumes it?
5986620	5987620	There's so much.
5987620	5989620	To make to make sure.
5989620	5991620	To make sure it's not poison.
5991620	5992620	And if it is, then we only lose you.
5992620	5996620	I go way back with Rogue and we like he saved my life and nom
5997620	6004620	I'll slurp it to see if it's poisonous or magical, cursed or something.
6004620	6006620	It's pretty strong.
6006620	6009620	It seems like you could use some pancakes to cut the flavor or something.
6016620	6024620	I mime Steve Carell's head on a stack of pancakes from the poster of Dan in Real Life.
6026620	6037620	I take out my bucket of plenty.
6037620	6043620	It's a magic bucket that holds more than it looks like it should hold.
6045620	6047620	From where do you procure this object?
6047620	6051620	It's one of my druidic magical implements that I carry.
6051620	6054620	It really leaves the house without a bucket of plenty.
6056620	6072620	I take my bucket of plenty and swoop it into the mystical goo and gather as much as I can.
6072620	6082620	As you grab the bucket, you feel the impact of wood against wood.
6082620	6085620	Something's attacking the walls around you.
6085620	6086620	Fight!
6091620	6094620	I don't know what he said because he just kind of jiggles.
6101620	6104620	Are we being attacked by wood? Other wood?
6104620	6105620	You aren't.
6105620	6110620	You're just feeling this woody room you're in, this tree-like room you're in.
6110620	6112620	It's all getting wailed on.
6112620	6118620	Let's take my bucket of plenty full of syrup of begonias and get the fuck out through the hole that we came in through.
6118620	6121620	I fill my five flasks and I too.
6123620	6126620	You do that. You land back in the shack.
6126620	6129620	It's great. Oh man, it's not fucked in any way.
6129620	6142620	I call an Uber and say, let's go to Pete's house and eat these motherfucking pancakes.
6142620	6144620	It's going to be the best.
6144620	6146620	Oh man, you don't get signal on air.
6146620	6150620	It's bad. Some serious shit.
6150620	6156620	Wait, Kettle One, don't you have dark powers that you could maybe get us a ride home or something like that?
6156620	6157620	Yes.
6159620	6162620	You get a dark powered ride home.
6165620	6166620	All right.
6166620	6174620	Should we end the D&D session there to make sure they get their festival moneys worth and do a horrible rap?
6174620	6175620	Yeah, let me get it.
6178620	6183620	But only if Michael is my, I want you to be like my Rihanna.
6183620	6184620	Beatbox for us.
6184620	6190620	I'll rap and then you'll do like the hook or something.
6195620	6197620	Yeah, that's not going to happen.
6199620	6201620	It would be a pretty low stakes gig, I feel.
6201620	6202620	People would be on your side.
6202620	6204620	But look, I won't tell you your business.
6204620	6208620	Well, he could say what he would sing and then Christian has to sing it.
6208620	6210620	Like he has to interpret it.
6210620	6218620	I mean, look, I don't want to force Christian to do your bidding.
6218620	6219620	Or Daniela.
6219620	6221620	I mean, I got to get in the zone.
6221620	6222620	I don't know about you guys.
6224620	6226620	We're close to being a hard out here.
6226620	6228620	Yeah, no, we got to hurry up.
6228620	6238620	All right, so by the time we see each other again, we may be just part of the New Republic of California.
6241620	6251620	We're all wearing camouflage and with like like like soap dispenser helmets and like weird like microchip belts and
6252620	6257620	we're going to have the best TV and movies and like lots of cheese and almonds.
6258620	6263620	And and and roughly 40 percent of the gross national product as far as I know.
6263620	6267620	I mean, should we organize something where we just say, am I getting a shot for saying this?
6267620	6270620	Is it going to be a laser on my chest as I say this?
6270620	6276620	But don't we pay these motherfuckers every quarter a bunch of money?
6276620	6278620	Can't we just sit on it and go?
6278620	6282620	We know like he what you talking about like lately.
6282620	6285620	Isn't that how the United States works?
6285620	6287620	Is it like money flows?
6287620	6289620	I think it's also how a Civil War starts.
6289620	6292620	But I mean, yeah, like, yeah.
6292620	6293620	Okay.
6293620	6294620	All right.
6294620	6296620	I don't want to be your civil.
6296620	6297620	Wow.
6297620	6298620	Wow.
6298620	6300620	What's so civil about war?
6300620	6301620	All right.
6301620	6306620	Wait, am I correct remembering that the Axl Rose guns and roses rhymed.
6306620	6308620	I don't want to be a Civil War.
6308620	6311620	I don't want to be your human grocery store.
6311620	6313620	Yes, that's a fucking terrible lyric.
6313620	6314620	Well, let's let's improve on it.
6314620	6315620	Gross.
6315620	6316620	We style.
6316620	6317620	Wow.
6317620	6318620	All right.
6318620	6319620	Come on.
6319620	6320620	Give me a beat.
6320620	6321620	We're going to do it.
6321620	6322620	I'm going to put it on rap before you get paid.
6322620	6323620	Where is the guy?
6323620	6324620	There we go.
6324620	6325620	Yeah.
6325620	6326620	Yeah.
6326620	6327620	Yeah.
6327620	6328620	Yeah.
6328620	6329620	Yeah.
6329620	6330620	Yeah.
6330620	6331620	Yeah.
6331620	6332620	California.
6332620	6335620	C-A-F-L-O-R-N-I-A.
6335620	6336620	California.
6336620	6337620	California.
6337620	6348140	Got the biggest state on the leftmost coast.
6348140	6350780	We have the TV and we make it the most.
6350780	6353300	We also got the Inland Empire.
6354300	6355300	We got the meth.
6358300	6359300	Yeah.
6359300	6361300	California is the place to be.
6361300	6366300	If you try to go further, you'll be in the sea.
6366300	6367300	California.
6367300	6368300	California.
6368300	6369300	California.
6369300	6370300	California.
6370300	6371300	Oh, God.
6371300	6372300	Oh.
6372300	6378300	Here's one of me saying, uh,
6378300	6381300	get a one.
6381300	6382300	Yeah.
6382300	6383300	Yeah.
6383300	6384300	Yeah.
6384300	6385300	Yeah.
6385300	6386300	Left coast.
6386300	6387300	Right coast.
6387300	6388300	North, south.
6388300	6390300	Fuck your mama so hard.
6390300	6392300	She needed a second mouth.
6392300	6395300	She said, Dan Harmon, come to me.
6395300	6400300	I said, I want to get in the tub and pee on a Russian hooker
6400300	6401300	with Vitamir.
6401300	6406300	I'm going to fuck your mama so hard the Russia's near to us
6406300	6408300	than it's ever been.
6408300	6410300	Fucking with the election.
6410300	6416300	I fucked your mama in the bargain bin.
6416300	6423300	It's a terrible rap because it has an agenda.
6423300	6425300	When you bring politics into rapping,
6425300	6429300	it just takes a bad rapping turn.
6429300	6431300	It doesn't, the rap should come from the heart.
6431300	6434300	That's why rap doesn't typically, you know,
6434300	6437300	you don't see a lot of rappers and inaugurations.
6437300	6439300	That's, rap comes from the streets.
6439300	6440300	It comes from your feelings.
6440300	6442300	It doesn't, you're not supposed to just be like,
6442300	6445300	you should vote for Jerry Brown.
6445300	6447300	All right.
6447300	6448300	I fucked your mama.
6448300	6450300	I fucked her good.
6450300	6453300	I fucked her like she was made of wood.
6453300	6457300	What that means is that I respected her
6457300	6461300	as if she was a Douglas fir.

6516300	6518300	It's a good show.
