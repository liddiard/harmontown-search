0	22680	From the Jupiter Hotel, the Douglas fir, duck fir, whatever the fuck the place is called.
22680	27680	Portland, Oregon, one of the greatest cities on the planet Earth.
28680	34680	It is my absolute pleasure to say that Harman Town is now in session.
37680	41680	Let's welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman!
45680	46680	Thank you.
50680	51680	Thank you.
52680	56680	I immediately started crying. I walked out of the stage and started crying.
56680	59680	I think it's because I'm drunk. I'm assuming.
60680	62680	It's not because tonight's important.
65680	68680	There are people in the world with leukemia. Why am I crying?
70680	73680	I'm crying because your donuts are great. You're a great city.
74680	78680	How many of you are here that live in Portland?
78680	88680	See, a lot of times, Jeff, when we go to other cities, we go like, who here is from Poughkeepsie?
88680	93680	And then there's like eight people go like, I'm here. And then the rest of the people are like, I drove here from L.A.
94680	100680	Because they hate Poughkeepsie. Portland, people love being in Portland. They fucking love it.
101680	107680	It is a great town. I've got to ask, what's the guy's name? Andy, who's running this thing?
108680	114680	Yeah. He said, do you want to come do this festival? And I said, yes, can I be there for three days instead of one?
115680	118680	I'd rather be in Portland than not be in Portland.
119680	128680	I scheduled extra days, too. For Aaron's sake, I said, well, I'll stay till Sunday and I'm not going to do any other shows,
129680	139680	other than Harmontown. Aaron will appreciate that. And then I went, it was like gift of the like UCB workshop magi that I said,
140680	144680	I'm not doing any shows except there. She's like, I'm doing nine shows a day.
145680	151680	If you'd like to see Aaron McGathey this weekend in Portland, just swing a cat.
152680	159680	Try not to. She is on every fucking show this side of Seattle. I don't know.
160680	164680	I don't know. You have to have a response to that. All right, let's get let's get on track.
165680	171680	I don't want to have a sloppy show tonight. You've paid a lot of money. I am not drunk. I didn't do anything wrong.
172680	176680	You're drunk as a fucking fiddler right now. So drunk. He's lying.
177680	180680	I met you for breakfast. You were drunk when you showed up for breakfast.
185680	191680	I was hungover. We were all hungover. We all we all we all know what happened yesterday. We all got drunk.
192680	201680	So then when you're hungover, you drink through it. You don't you don't go like I'm hungover. I'm not going to drink ever again.
201680	207680	That's rookie bullshit that will take you straight to A.A. That's for quitters.
210680	216680	It's an old stand up joke. A.A. is for quitters. I'm wearing we went to Mary's trip club today.
217680	224680	I made I made Dan and Aaron. I had breakfast at Mother's, which is too crowded now. Yeah.
224680	230680	And then I went to Hubris to have a Spanish coffee. But Hubris fucking good. But I didn't have a Spanish coffee.
231680	241680	I had a Manhattan and then three more with a couple of people named Tina and Dirk. And if God I hope they're listening at some point in the future because they were hilarious.
242680	250680	And then you guys rolled in and then I made Dan and Aaron go to Mary's Mary's club, which is I think a Portland institution.
250680	260680	Not that I'm a strip club enthusiast necessarily, but you kind of have to go there because it's so good. I think you have to be a strip club enthusiast to go to any strip club.
261680	275680	You have to be into Legos to buy a Lego box, right? You don't just go like, oh, that looks interesting. Blacks that connects. You can't you can't like walk in off the street into a strip club and be like, oh, cool.
275680	286680	Like you have to be like a fucking aficionado because you don't you go there because the girls that work there, it's so small. And there's like weird theater seating. There's like two rows of theater seats.
287680	294680	And you can buy a drink and pee at the same time. Like it's so small. That's not he's selling that like it's like a big positive thing.
295680	309680	If you can drink and pee in the same place, that's not. But the girls all have ill-advised tattoos and they get up there and there's a jukebox on stage. And when they go on stage, they put a couple dollars in and they play fucking Tom Waits and shit.
309680	319680	Like, well, I see you tonight on a downtown trade and they're taking their clothes off and then their butt cheeks are doing weird yoga shit. It's funny.
319680	332680	They flex there. They do like the tiny Lister Junior thing with their boobs where they flex the pack. You don't go there. The Mr. Universe thing with the boobs, but they have boobs. So they're like, like, like Jim Henson workshop kind of character.
332680	351680	Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. I'll tell you what it isn't. It's not sexy. Here's the conversation that happened on the sidewalk after we went in there for a drink. This is the classic conversation that a lot of people have. Aaron turned to me and Jeff and said, so do you guys have boners?
351680	380680	And I immediately went, which is the truth. I'm like, no, absolutely not. My penis is retracted into my abdomen because I was in a place of grief. And then Aaron goes, oh, what? You didn't think those girls were attractive? I don't know. It's a fucking minefield. I don't get it. I don't know what my role is. I don't know how to be a feminist. I don't know how to be a masculinist in a strip club.
380680	403680	I don't know what you do. When I walk into a strip club, what I typically find is that it's dead silent and that there's a woman on stage and that she's doing this stuff and she seems like a good person. The odd thing about this place is that the quarters are so close and it was so quiet that you were really intimately acquainted with the performers.
403680	432680	And what I mean by that is that a woman would finish doing booby wiggles and then she would go over to a three-ring binder and while leafing through it would say to the guy to her left, hey, Glenn, what do you like? And he would go like, I don't know. The traffic was so hard on the 110 today. And she'd be like, yeah, well, you should always take fountain. This is LA traffic speak, but I'm just saying like she was like talkish. I was like, did you see Hannibal last night? It was like, good.
432680	451680	And I think that's, from a human perspective, that's what's supposed to happen. But from a regular perspective, it's weird because now I don't understand. I don't understand my role. If you what you said, you said, Jeff, you said, you can just go in there and hang out.
451680	473680	I said, if I go up to the rail in a strip club and I start just talking loudly about how I think parks and rec is cheating because they can cut to people explaining jokes. Like, if I'm just like, explain, yeah, it's mockumentary. It's like, it's overblown. I get it. Ricky Gervais did it for six episodes, but it was part of the story. And then you adopt it into America.
474680	501680	Capital is a storyteller money. There's a guy behind me is going to have a right to go, Hey, fuck off. What are you doing in a strip club? And I'm gonna go, I don't know. I don't know why I'm in a strip club. It's not to get a boner. It's not. It's not for her. It's not for me. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know. I don't know whose side I'm on. I know she's empowered. I'm empowered. We're all empowered. I don't know what the fuck's going on in here.
502680	509680	I'll just take off my clothes or just roll around and like throw money in the air and eat tacos. I don't know what the fuck to do.
510680	528680	Why is there an orange garnish in your drink right now? You have a sexy cocktail right now. This is a Negroni. A Negroni. This is my cheat day. I'm a cheat day. Wait, so vodka is regular day. Yeah. That's zero carbs. You can have, you can have, you can have. Wow.
529680	537680	Find a carb and a glass of vodka. I defy you. A Negroni, that's like the doughnut of drinks.
538680	553680	So you can have bourbon and Campari. So we left Mary's Club and I went to Powell's Books. By the way, shut up. I went to, for me, my first two stops, well first stop when I come to Portland, Powell's Books, because it's the Disneyland of people that read.
554680	562680	Dan, books are things with pages with words on them that people read. I know. It's like the internet, but smaller. With lower speeds.
563680	578680	So I said, we got, we got drunk at Hubers. I met some local lunatics and I said, I really have to go to Hubers. I started down at two of Powell's. I popped in there. I got a couple of books and you went and found a bar. I got a text from you saying I'm in a nearby bar.
579680	596680	I didn't say it's the coolest place in the world. It's just a place. I got a glass of chamet. But true to Portland style, talk about Southern hospitality. Portland hospitality. The only person working in the place was a one bartender.
597680	612680	And she gave me, I guess, I thought of a chamet. I said, I'm feeling fancy. I'm a lumberjack. I'd like to, maybe I'll build a new bar next door on a wood. Everything's wood here. They're all into wood. I bet there hasn't been a tree here in years.
614680	618680	What there is, is good people and good prices.
619680	629680	So drunk. So drunk. All right. Everybody gets a medal for noticing I'm drunk. What are you going to do with it? Who are you going to complain to?
630680	647680	So I'm in the bookstore. I was drunk enough at the bookstore to walk up to the person at Powell's. You can walk up to the desk and say hello. I would like you to check if these books exist. I'd be happy to help you. And I couldn't utter a word.
648680	651680	You're allowed to do that in Portland. You can get that wasted.
651680	661680	And the guy looked at me and said, hey, you're in a town or you can come fucked up to a bookstore. Hey, man. Seems like you're pretty drunk and high. Section 642.
662680	673680	By the way, I need to see these books. By the way, I'm making a mental note out loud right now to get all of the drugs that people gave me last night out of my bag before I fly away.
674680	691680	If anybody wants a bunch of edibles and weed, I have to get rid of them. I'm a piñata. Come up to me tonight because all of you give me Rice Krispie treats. I can't eat them all. I can't bring them on the plane. So just hit me and we'll pop out.
692680	702680	Also, the beauty of this gig is we're staying upstairs. We live here at the Jupiter Hotel in the Dunk Fur. Seriously, just ask me if you want all of the shit that people gave me last night.
703680	718680	Dude, I was fucking dancing last night. Aaron was in the other room. I fucking danced till four in the morning because it's Portland. He just feels like, you know, this is Portland. And I was like, dance until four in the morning by myself. I wasn't grinding on anybody.
719680	732680	I wasn't, like, doing it to impress anybody. I was just, like, fucking dancing. I had a straw in my mouth. I had a solo cup in my hand. I'm, like, fucking 41. I'm like, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.
733680	747680	Sometimes I get my feet at rest, don't move them anymore. I'm, like, doing vertical shit that's moving the hips. Elevator goes up, down, fucking rocking it. Fucking people coming up, like, shaking their shit in my face. I'm, like, yeah, I'll take that. I won't take that. I don't give a fuck.
748680	777680	I don't want to control the floor. And there was a guy that kept coming up to me. I don't know if he had this authority, but he kept going, like, are you ready to freestyle? Are you ready to freestyle? Every half hour this, like, this guy would come up and he'd start dancing with me. And he'd go, like, so you wanted freestyle yet? And I felt like he was friends with the DJ. And I felt like there was a point where I could have easily gone up and I could have freestyled, wrapped, at the thing. But I turned my back on it.
778680	807680	Yeah. Before we get to your freestyle, let's go back to me leaving pal's books. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. We got a lot of, we got a lot of. So I'm happily, I have two new books. I don't need them. I've got too many books I haven't read anyway. I'm drunk. I'm leaving pal's books. I have a text from Dan saying, I'm at a bar nearby. So I fucking rolled out of there and I used the old iPhone to find out what you are. And I come into a place called... It was called Riley. Life of Riley.
807680	836680	Yeah. You don't have to grumble. It's fine. You know, all right. You're Portland, we get it. It was empty. That's the thing. Like, good places were full. Okay. So take it from there because I walk in there. You're there. You have a chamet in your hand. There were two dudes as a preamble. There were two dudes that I felt like they were a gay couple just to put an image in your head of their mannerisms. Like, they were two really fit dudes who were very happy.
837680	844680	And I'm like, but also they had a weird, fratty edge to them. It was a weird combination. And the one guy...
844680	850680	I would not have, if I saw them from a distance, I would not have said gay couple. I would have thought fratty guys.
850680	860680	Maybe I'm homophobic or maybe I'm like homo doodle. Like, I don't care. I love, I would love for everyone to be gay.
860680	864680	I'm going to put my picture right now for this episode to be called homo doodle.
865680	872680	Maybe I projected onto them. I bet they're gay because I wanted them to be happy because I felt like they were having a good time together.
872680	877680	There was a lot of sexual frustration. There was a lot of energy and drama coming from them.
877680	882680	And I was like, I hope those two go home tonight and fuck. I felt like they were gay.
882680	890680	And you know what? I wanted to give them each two votes in the upcoming election.
891680	901680	In case you're wondering if I'm part of the problem, no. I would like to live in a society where every gay man got three fucking votes.
901680	902680	What happened before I walked in?
902680	904680	Because I want to live in gay world.
904680	906680	Dan, you're fine.
906680	911680	I'm sorry, am I protesting too much? I'm just saying, I'm cool with the gays.
911680	914680	Everything would be better if they were in charge.
914680	916680	You're straight. What you're saying is you're straight.
916680	929680	What I don't want is for them to beat me up. And so what happened at this bar is these were very, very, very rare, incredibly rare, bad gay men, I felt.
934680	937680	I feel like genetically they're better than everyone.
937680	945680	But these two, I would like to weed them out or make them straight.
945680	947680	I don't know what would be a punishment for them.
947680	950680	Just tell the story.
950680	953680	You're right. You're right. No more editorializing.
953680	957680	You make your own decision. I don't know. They might have been straight.
957680	966680	If they were, that explains a lot. Because if they were straight, then they were fucking in turmoil inside.
966680	969680	I don't think they were, but I will withhold judgment to it.
969680	978680	Incredibly sweet bartender. I should say she's female because it seems important. We're setting a stage here.
978680	987680	Very, very sweet female bartender who, as a footnote, I ordered a drink from her and she said, do you want something from the menu?
987680	994680	Would you like somebody to eat? And I said, do you have a dessert menu?
995680	1001680	We don't have dessert. Five seconds later, she puts a handful of peppermint candies on the bottom.
1001680	1008680	Portland. Hashtag Portland. We're here to fucking, we're thinking about you.
1008680	1013680	This doesn't happen anywhere ever. That's the opposite of Logan's run.
1013680	1019680	Somebody's like, I thought when you said, her job was done. They don't have a dessert menu.
1020680	1029680	She fucking took that shit to a bowl of candy, but I don't get it. I don't even get it. I love it. I love your city.
1029680	1034680	And I'm sitting there and going like, Jesus Christ, what a good, good people.
1034680	1043680	She, I'm trying to make you understand this woman's a hero because then she went over to the other guys and they were kind of dramatic and very fit.
1043680	1050680	Maybe that's part of what I'm holding against them. They looked, they, they looked crunchy and Abby and six packy and.
1050680	1060680	Crunchy? Gunny, bicep-y. Like they looked good. I wanted to sleep with them, but so I think they were gay.
1064680	1070680	She, she went to them and they were, they were being loud the whole time. It was fine. It was like, they were just charismatic individuals in the corner.
1070680	1079680	They're having a good time. Probably talking about spot checking each other and bench press. She goes, she said to one of them, do you guys want anything else?
1079680	1088680	And the, and the loud, like kind of aggressive one who we will call, let's call it, let's give him a name. Stripe, Stripe, the bad gremlin.
1088680	1102680	He, he said to her, she went, uh, can I get you guys anything else? And he went, I'm just having the greatest time looking at you. Is that rude?
1102680	1115680	Yeah, it is. That's weird. I don't know. So that was the mood he was in. He was like, he was, he was feeling his oats. Was that a phrase?
1115680	1121680	I mean, it is now.
1121680	1140680	So Jeff walks in with Moby Dick or whatever the fuck you bought from here. Prove we can still exist book start. Like it's a movement flash mob hashtag like books should still exist.com.
1140680	1155680	We get it. It's fun with your thumb. Oh, it cut me. Oh, great. Information at a price. Who would have thought of it?
1155680	1173680	You're anti book. I don't know why I'm doing that. It's a weird platform. It's a weird, it's a weird, you don't want to be even, even if most of the world feels that way, you know, no one will feel okay getting on your side of that.
1173680	1181680	I'm anti book. The Jeff locks in with his fucking books, but what was my Mark Twain? Look it up. Fucking Google him. You bought a Mark Twain book.
1181680	1196680	Yes, because when people, I beat people and they, we talk about books and they go, oh, you should read this and I write it down on my phone. Yeah. A phone, my iPhone. I have a little note thing and I write down books titles and I, and when I go to Powell's or if I'm in Seattle, I go to Elliott Bay.
1196680	1210680	Or is it Elliott Bay? Yeah. And like the good bookstores in the world that actually carry the shit that you want to find. That's not like a Barnes and Noble piece of garbage. When you go to Portland, you can actually find the books that you wish you had and the end. I'm smart.
1210680	1231680	Read a book, motherfucker. Read a book. You're a writer. You're a writer. Read a fucking book. Yeah. Reading is for consumers. I'm a writer. Consumers of what? That's like a spider being into spider webs.
1231680	1258680	Like a spider's eye. No, I love spider webs. No, motherfucker, you spun this shit. If a spider could read, a spider would read a book about spring webs. I'm going to fight you. I'm going to fight you in Portland. Spiders can't read. What happened to this place? We've wasted a lot of time on this tonight. What happened to this place? Inexplicably. I roll in with books. Two provocative materials.
1258680	1287680	So Jeff's at the end of the bar. Bar in quotes because it's beach wood. It's bright. It's day lit. It's a nice place. It's a touristy downtown dumpy bar. And then one of these two incredibly sexy probably gay guys. He senses there's other people there. He goes up to Aaron and he goes like, what was his entree?
1287680	1316680	What was his entree? It was like, I hope he's not with you. You're so beautiful. Hello. Oh, and then he said, yes, this is my side of the story. We'll bring Aaron out in a second. I want to hear her side, but he's in my, from my objective, glowering into my chamet. I had just sat down. He said, hello, sweetheart. I was like, he kind of, he did an extravagant kind of like, like, hello. I'm, I'm, I'm that guy from the other part of the bar. I want your attention now too, which is fine.
1317680	1338680	I love your style. You're so beautiful. You look great. And then he, but he, in, in the midst of that introduction, he said, I hope you're not with him and did this kind of sassy like to, to Jeff, like, I hope you're not, I hope you're not with him. And Jeff said like, like, go fuck yourself. Fuck off. And then he goes, what? And then he was like, I wasn't talking to you.
1338680	1366680	I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, he goes like, I hope you're not with him. I go, oh, you, yeah, yeah, you fuck off. And he was just like, he came over and like, was like being like too much. And, and I said, yeah, you go away. And he goes, oh, I hope you're not with him. And I said, your person, he goes, I'm a stylist. I just think your hair is so cool. Like to Aaron's like, I go, your personality, your personality needs touching up. And he goes, oh,
1368680	1391680	and then his friend, his even sexier friend, which is who I assume is gay because he's fucking hot, uh, started saying things like, I could hear them before that happened. He goes, he goes, what do you say? I go, Hey, uh, he goes, I wasn't talking to you. I said, well, you were. I said, your voice carries. He goes, oh, my voice carries.
1392680	1417680	Yeah, he did a thing where he was like, my voice carries, but it fell flat. It was like a flat C flat. And I said, I said something along the lines that, Hey, fuck off. The adults are having a conversation over here. And then he enlisted the more muscular guy in the duo. He goes, stop me before I do something stupid.
1418680	1431680	That's what you heard. I heard. And then he said, later on in this altercation, there's like, like, this big five minute, like, blossom of human interaction. At one point I heard this guy say, so I was like, yeah, on a certain point, I got to start slicing faces.
1432680	1433680	Slicing faces?
1434680	1450680	That was after I left. I had left at that point. The guy goes, the guy that came at us with the, I'm a stylist and I'm Mr. Wonderful. And I like, oh, wait, I hope you're not with him. I go, hey, you go away. Your personality could use some touching up.
1455680	1460680	Now, Mr. Wonderful over here wants to be involved because it stopped before I do something stupid. I'm going to slice some faces.
1463680	1473680	I grabbed my Mark Twain and whatever. What was in the book? I forgot. I picked my two books up and I fucking bone out because I know where this is going because where it's going is nowhere.
1474680	1483680	Then I read a fucking tweet from you that where the guy was threatened to slice faces. That was during the whole thing. I could hear him. And so I was engaging with him. He would say stuff.
1484680	1498680	A really young man. Really? You're going to beat people up. And he and I actually had an arc at the end of it. I had because he. This is the guy that you refer to as so hot. He must be gay. Yeah. All right. This is this guy is actually the hero of the story.
1499680	1514680	Because you want to fuck him. No, because he because he was telling you. So you fuck this guy, right? He felt an obligation to beat everyone up who had a problem with his friend who was causing trouble.
1514680	1527680	So he would when I actually engage with him, I was like, he said, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said, look, I'm sorry to I. It's weird to threaten to slice people's faces. And he said, he said, look, I.
1528680	1543680	I'm with my friend. I feel like I have to stick up for my friend. I'm like, there you go. That's humanity. That's it in the bottle. Everyone's got to stick up for their friend. The fucking like, that's why bar fights happen. It's like dumb. It's like two guys like you.
1544680	1560680	We spent too much time on this. Those guys are listening to this and going like, who we meet. We did it because here's another fucking weird thing. Aaron said Aaron said I didn't hear this. Aaron said that during the altercation, one of them pointed to you and said, I'm glad your show got canceled.
1561680	1571680	You thought that you were me, I assume. I don't know that I was Jeff Winger. I don't know. I don't know. Or, or, or they thought whose line is not coming back. I don't know.
1572680	1575680	Let's not bury the lead. Your show got canceled. Yes, it did. It did. It did.
1576680	1591680	By gay people. You guys are gay. Gay people. By gay. By gay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we should address that in due time. I'm sorry. We spent too much time talking about some weird beachwood bar.
1592680	1603680	I was in a plane yesterday and I landed and the driver named Dan. Dan, are you here? You are? Dan Kogan. Is he here?
1604680	1616680	Are you like Hodar from Game of Thrones? Oh no. Oh no. Dan. Oh no. It's not his name. It's just a sound he makes. Anyway. Dan. Dan love.
1617680	1629680	I flew in before you did and our driver Dan Kogan said, Dan, I'm picking him up in an hour or two. Does he know that his show got canceled? I go, I didn't know that.
1630680	1646680	I said, I said, I wonder, I said, when did that news drop? And he goes recently, like you, there was a chance that you were on the plane when that news dropped, but they called me. Yeah. I was on my way to LAX and somebody from Sony called me and they told me, I, I, listen, I,
1647680	1663680	the fans of that show have more reason to be upset than I do. I can, I can go try to create another show. And also I got paid for every minute I cared about that show.
1664680	1671680	And a lot of, a lot of you, I don't know what you're plotting, but, but capitalism.
1674680	1687680	The trickle down, the people that are most devastated are people that put unpaid labor into the show. It said like, like, like, ah, I'm hashtagging this. I'm getting a tattoo of this. I, I, I love this show. They didn't get compensated for it.
1687680	1716680	They had a relationship with the show. Were there, were there community tattoos? Oh, sure. There was community tattoos. Does anybody here have a community related tattoo? You don't have to be ashamed. I always have mixed feelings about the tattoo thing. Like I say, somebody showed me like a Rick and Morty tattoo and I'll go, I'm not sure. It's like the highest compliment, but at the same time, like, I don't know what to terrible idea. Well, I don't, it depends on what you feel. I don't know what it's not. It's none of your business. How somebody wants to, I don't know. It's weird.
1717680	1740680	Like, like it's a permanent thing. And then you dumb. This is not entertainment. This is me. Dan, like your feelings aside, like, and also you can't totally relate to the hardcore fan who loves community. But now it's like, that's, that's the end of the show that means a lot to people. Also clearly means a lot to you. The fact that that's now done. How does that emotionally.
1740680	1767680	It'll take weeks to sink in. But there was somebody who handed out, there was, there was literature being handed out. Kyle. Kyle, right? I gave it to you. Every time we come to Portland, there's a high concept gimmick. Graphic design. Some more intelligent. Everyone here. No, no one lifts anything in Portland. Everyone just goes to work at a draft table.
1767680	1794680	And they eat coffee and then they go home in a weirdly designed like egg shaped race car bed that folds up into God's consciousness for eight hours when it folds down and they go back out and be open minded for a living. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what you people do. You're delightful. I love you. You should move here. You should. I'm gonna. I'm gonna move here.
1794680	1821680	I'm gonna move here and have a bunch of babies. Lumberjack babies. All my kids are gonna look like the lead singer of Spin Doctors. Don't you dare boo the fucking Spin Doctors. You fucking Portland asshole. I think he booed your baby. He has to be your last defense against Skynet.
1824680	1840680	He's gonna have a microphone in one hand and an axe in the other. Don't you dare boo Connor Harmon. Portland native Connor. Connor Harmon.
1840680	1868680	I remember when I was 10 years old, as I've said before on the show, I was on as a kid, I was in the King and I this play with your Brenner and we toured the country and we did Broadway and then he died. But when I was 10, I don't know why that's funny, but I love that you. If Jeff asked you to be part of his next Broadway production, as tempting as it is, just say no. Yeah, you gotta die. But when I was 10, we did the, is it the Fitzer? The Fitzer? The Fitzer?
1868860	1887680	The Fitzer? The Fitzer? The Fister? Hare does super? Where's Schwut? Woah, there you go. Okay. Thank you. So anyway, I was a kid. I think he sleeve we played out the shaman of the Fister Bar. So we played at the Schmister, the Fister Bar, whatever the fuck.
1887680	1912520	And I was on tour with Ryan Stiles and Greg Proups and Chip Ester and we toured with a Who's Live, like a Who's Lying kind of thing. And I walked in there and I thought, oh fuck, I think I played in this theater when I was 10. And this is 20 years or, you know, 25 years later. And the doorman there, I said, I was here as a kid. And he goes, yeah, he goes, your name's Jeff. And it was the fucking doorman when I was a kid.
1912520	1941240	Oh boy. He goes, do you want me to walk you to your old dressing room? And he just started fucking me. Better than you've ever been fucked. Not true. New York style. East Coast style. No, but he remembered the show and there he fucking was. And he took me to my dressing room, which now I'm twice as tall as I was. And so the dressing room is twice as small as I remember. And we fucking did that show there. And like,
1943400	1957160	fuck, what's the point of my story? Oh, I remember now. So I was, I, we would do matinees and I would be, I had kind of like a, have page boy haircut because I played like a little British kid and I had makeup on because it was a theater show. And I was
1958160	1970760	10. And I went into a McDonald's with my brother who did not have makeup on. But we went in there to McDonald's here in Portland. What's the park near where the Fister or the Fitzer or the Spitzer is?
1971400	1977800	Yeah, there was a McDonald's there and I fucking roll in there at 10 years old. And the guy goes, what can I get you ladies?
1983080	1994040	I was like, we're boys. And he goes, well, what can I get you? It's like you motherfucker. It's like, just because I'm wearing makeup at 10 a.m.
1994040	2022520	Doesn't mean I'm gay or a girl. I've never forgiven Portland for that. I think it's why you and that guy got in a fight tonight. I didn't get in a fight. I left. You got in a fight. I didn't get in a fucking fight. I was hunched over chamé. All right. Were you going to freestyle tonight? Yeah. Let's give these people their money's worth. In LA, you pay $10. $10 is whatever. It gets you a pair of socks. These people paid probably more. There's other people who paid VIP.
2023400	2045320	I met some of them in the bar. They got VIP bracelets. They paid more money to make sure that they could get in. Not have to wait in line. Doesn't matter. Capitalism can go fuck itself, but it serves me tonight. I not that I'm taking a cut. I don't I don't give a fuck about your money. But what I do want to make sure of is that you're entertained. Is James Adomian here?
2045320	2075320	There was a gasp. Is he here? Is he here? I heard he was. James, are you here? No, he's not here. Oh, fuck. All right. It's fine. It doesn't matter. No, because that was going to be a fucking goodie. I wanted to do James Adomian is here at the festival. He does the best Vincent Price impression I've ever heard in my life. I wanted to. I told them last night. Come to the show. We'll do a rap. And then you do the Vincent Price bridge for the
2075320	2105320	show. Yeah. Spiders delight. Spiders delight. Ooky, ooky sandwiches. Why are spiders so delightful? No, it's a spiders delight. Apostrophe S. Spiders delight is horror. What does the Adams family like? They like bad soup. Spiders delight. It's not it's not a good delicious cupcake. Wrong beat. Wrong beat.
2105320	2135320	Anybody James Adomian? Anybody got a 20 on James Adomian? Nope. Fuck that guy. That's Bridgetown for you. It's Bridgetown, dad. Forget it. Forget about it. Kumail's off doing a different show. Kumail. He was so funny last night. I've been a lot of, like, cool friends. Paul Provenza. Paul Provenza. I had never met. Oh shit. Yeah. Yo. Yo. I'll do my own Vincent Price. Yeah. Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Write it down. Write it down. Write it down.
2135320	2165320	Yo. Yo. Yo. Yo. Rap. Rap. Rap. Rap. Yo. Rap. Wait. Dan told me before the show that he was going to rap tonight. And that not only was he going to rap, that it was going to be great. That he wasn't going to do one of those tepid, you know, like slap dash pitch pain. But you pale on it. You say a word that you can't rhyme and then you
2165320	2195320	see the word together. You rhyme that word with that word and you bail on it. You felt like tonight you're going to deliver actual, like, some rheumatologies. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Here we go. Yo. Yo. Yo. All right. Yo. You're holding the mic wrong. You don't have to hold the mic like that. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Come on, man. Yo. Here we go. Yo. Dan Harvey. Best rap ever. Yo.

We know what I we know what I did wrong there. You want to stick to monosyllabic words that end with a vowel freestyle day. Dan, don't be fettered by by by Peter or you know, I fucked up. I fucked up.
2225320	2255320	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Portland. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dan, I would say rap rap rap about your day like rap about like like what's it what's on your mind. How do you know I wasn't going to. Because you said yo for 16 measures. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK.
2255320	2285320	All right. OK. Yeah. Just. That's still just. That's my phone. I'm trying. I got to wipe my head clean every time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just just feeling just feeling the beat. I'm in Portland. The land of trees and sky. Why ain't we in Seattle. Tell me why. Because it's too far north and too
2285320	2315320	fucked up. Yo. Portland is what's up. It's it's a beautiful place full of trees. Fuck your mama so hard that she fell to her knees and she she begged for more. She said let's go camp and make your dick into a s'more. I said I'm out of chocolate and crackers. You know don't know what you're doing. But I got financial backers go to Kickstarter. Try to get a new season gonna fuck your mama so hard. Don't got no reason.
2315320	2345320	Whoa. Fuck your mama and your dad. Fuck your mama so hard. She said that wasn't bad. But you could do it better. Put your daddy in a Superman sweater. And he made him knit his own. It was a new form of emasculation. He was owned. Sat in a chair knitted a sweater. Like he acted like he didn't care. But the truth is he was emasculated. Fuck your mama so
2345320	2375320	hard. Just give me just give me a second. Yeah. Fuck your good. It's all right. Thank you. Thank you for your support. Thank you. That's it for a good cause. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

2375320	2405320	side. But your mama so hard that her pussy got wide. Drove a train from A to B through her. Fuck your mama like my name was Ben Herr. Got in my chariot whipping it next to me. Fuck your mama until she had a hysterectomy. No. Sorry about that. That was fucked up. Sorry. Sorry. Sometimes the science drops and you don't know you become a cyclops. You got
2405320	2435320	one eye and you're just looking at the beats. Sorry. Turn your mama. That was fucked up. Surgical to clinical uncle. It's not cool. Sorry. All right. Here we go. One last one last verse. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

2479780	2483440	Yo. Oh, here you go.
2483440	2486400	But your mama is so hard, she had a hysterectomy.
2486400	2489000	I know. It wasn't my idea. It was...
2489000	2490300	I think it's brilliant.
2490300	2495900	When you rap, God moves through you. If God's misogynist, it's not my problem.
2495900	2499300	You fucked someone so hard.
2499300	2503220	She got damaged. But she liked it.
2503220	2503900	She chose.
2503900	2509540	But no, she had it. You fucked her so hard that she was like, there's no way I'm not pregnant.
2509540	2511860	You fucked her so hard, she had elective surgery.
2511860	2515300	Yeah. And she she was smiling the whole way. She loved it.
2515300	2518940	I never want to get fucked that hard again.
2518940	2520580	Thanks for having me, guys.
2520580	2524220	No problem.
2524220	2526020	Great. All right.
2526020	2531060	All right. So what was real quick? Let's let's agree that that's been more than nine minutes on this.
2531060	2535380	Well, real quick, I just wanted to clarify something.
2535380	2543460	When you when we walked out of a strip club, there was a misunderstanding when you said that your penis retracted.
2543460	2547100	I instinctively what I said was I thought they were really pretty.
2547100	2549980	I didn't say you didn't think they were and I'm already pregnant.
2549980	2551540	I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry.
2551540	2554740	No, no, it's OK. It's OK. I just and I know it was a misunderstanding.
2554740	2559540	You're right. No, it's just a bit of a minefield for a guy because because you can't.
2559540	2563220	You don't even know if your role as a feminist coming out of a strip club is supposed to be like,
2563220	2565820	but I don't even have a boner. There was nothing sexual about that.
2565820	2569020	And then you can follow that road. It doesn't lead all the way to Rome.
2569020	2571620	Yeah, we're all we're all confused.
2571620	2573260	Objectification of women in a different way.
2573260	2575900	Well, in the recent way, they were fucking ugly.
2575900	2577500	And it's like, well, OK, so there you go.
2577500	2579140	Like, oh, no, they were hot. I made my dick hard.
2579140	2584140	OK, now I don't know what the like, like what the bumper table like.
2584140	2586140	Why are we doing this? Yeah.
2586140	2589340	Jeff is the only person who knew why we were doing that.
2589340	2590820	He doesn't know. He doesn't know.
2591420	2595620	Because meanwhile, we're sitting here with the shirts from the place.
2595620	2598820	Jeff just takes us places and orders us to sit places.
2598820	2601780	You can't. You've been in Portland now several times in your life,
2601780	2603020	but you've never been to Mary's Club.
2603020	2606060	You have to have been there at least once because it's kind of it's special.
2606060	2608060	It's weird. It's an interesting place to be in.
2608060	2612620	It was just me to sit at the stage, which I was happy eventually that he made me do.
2612620	2618100	But I was I was uncomfortable because I was going in because it was presented as a spectacle.
2618100	2624140	And then I walked in and there's like this this person who is doing this dance that was great.
2624140	2630140	And I didn't want her to feel like I was making fun of her, which is such a narcissistic way.
2630140	2633540	I mean, she's not like I wonder what their relationship is with nudity.
2633540	2635500	Yeah, they've crossed a threshold. They don't care.
2635500	2638780	And it's their heroes, their martyrs, their victims.
2638780	2644260	I love her. When I had the dollars and I could give a dollar for like certain things that I liked,
2644260	2650420	like when when when she did the thing with her butt like the I was like, I really like that.
2650420	2654420	And then that's what I don't like. I don't like sitting at the I don't know what I'm rewarding
2654420	2658380	because I've never I've never been turned on by any performance in a strip club.
2658380	2665380	And I'm not saying that that's the goal, because if you wanted to wear more sweaters like like like like
2665380	2669500	like I would like to watch just like a lady just like in a sweater.
2669500	2671900	That's funny. Yeah, you're rolling around in a beanbag.
2671900	2674220	I would feel very jealous. That would be pornographic to me.
2674220	2678660	That would be like like I wouldn't be. I would feel very jealous if we went into a strip club
2678660	2682340	and there was a woman fully clothed with tights and a sweater.
2682340	2688580	He just sat there and said, it would be called like bad. Yeah, I'd be like, we have to get out of here.
2688580	2693300	I can't. The theme of the bar be like teacher's assistance.
2693300	2697940	That would just be like girls sitting at a desk and going like, what else?
2697940	2700220	What else did you want? What memo did you want to send out?
2700220	2706620	And I'd be like, uh, tell Mr. Flammers that I don't push that meeting.
2706620	2711420	OK, yes, sir. That would I would walk out of there with with a bone, frankly, a bone.
2711420	2718140	Yeah. And it would be gross. Frankly, a boner with the women are fully naked
2718140	2722100	and they get the dragon tattoo on their back and they're like they're spinning around the pole.
2722100	2726380	That's not sexy. It's transcended sexuality, which is a good thing, I guess.
2726380	2730380	But you wanted to fuck those two gay guys at the bar. They're right.
2730380	2733660	Probably. But but I want to tell you what happened.
2733660	2737740	Well, you guys were in there getting these sweatshirts just because this is another thing.
2737740	2740180	What do you do about strip clubs? What do you do about sexuality?
2740180	2744740	What do you do about panhandling? All right. In L.A., we have lots of panhandlers.
2744740	2746580	San Francisco, we've talked about the panhandlers.
2746580	2752820	They I think the San Francisco panhandler population has been subjected to an undue amount of stress.
2752820	2759700	Panhandler in San Francisco, he's living in an area where it's like it's Eternia in the human universe.
2759700	2764540	Like everyone has to be an action figure. They had they had some of the worst, most draconian mayors.
2764540	2767860	There's no such thing as just a guy in an army jacket that needs a dollar.
2767860	2772820	That guy's been fucking brushed off to like down the coast in San Francisco.
2772820	2776620	If someone's panhandling you, he's got a fucking teacup on his head.
2776620	2783860	He's got an armor made of a furnace door like he's got a gimmick.
2783860	2787940	He's got a spell he's going to cast. He's got a magic trick to do.
2787940	2791580	I used to live in San Francisco and there was a panhandler who every time you walked by him,
2791580	2795020	he would propose marriage in a very sincere way.
2795020	2798100	And I always gave him money. I was always delighted by it.
2798100	2801900	We had an agreement. So here's what happened in Portland outside that strip club.
2801900	2806220	Well, Erin went back in to buy her T-shirt with you.
2806220	2808740	There's no moral to the story. I'm just sharing it.
2808740	2815340	There was a woman walking down the street. I would characterize her as I'm pretty sure she.
2815340	2819900	I think her poison was drank. I think that she but I don't know.
2819900	2826580	I'm not a social worker. I don't know. It's not my job to judge her or appraise her or know what she's into or whatever.
2826580	2831420	But I felt like looking at her as like, yeah, she's she's like me in 20 years.
2831420	2838980	And and she was like, you have any money? And then Erin went in the thing. I said, I got this.
2838980	2847300	I gave her a 20 because it's all I had. Well, I'm a tourist, too. And I just literally said, I got this.
2847300	2854580	I did. I did say that. I said, I got this because she approached and she said, dude, it held up her sign.
2854580	2860900	Like she was my old friend and she was like, you owe me five dollars. And I just I was following Jeff and I said, I got this.
2860900	2864820	All right. That's a yes. That's what I did. You got you got to have easy.
2864820	2871780	I bought you guys 90 dollars worth of Mary's Club swag. So I gave her I gave her I gave her a 20 dollar bill and she gave me a hug.
2871780	2876020	And we we held each other. And she said I wrote it down after she walked away.
2876020	2881140	She said, I don't normally hug people, but you did me a favor. And then she broke the hug.
2881140	2886660	And then she walked into a the complex housing complex next to the strip buyer.
2886660	2894020	She said, and you know what I'm talking about. She turned away and I was like, no, I don't know what you're talking about quite.
2894020	2897900	But I feel like I may have killed you because I gave you 20 dollars and you're taking it.
2897900	2905180	So so here's what happened next. Then two minutes later, because you guys were in the strip club buying a T-shirt, Lou Reed walks in.
2905180	2912260	Another couple, a couple walked by. I was like a homeless couple, the self-identified homeless couple.
2912260	2915580	This is why I'm while I'm back buying you guys hoodies. Yeah.
2916260	2924140	So then the woman had kind of she had sores on her face, like kind of like it was more of a methy thing.
2924140	2928340	Yeah. Not like an alcoholic thing, more of a speedy thing.
2928340	2933580	And she said, I wrote all this down because I wanted to talk about it tonight.
2933580	2937500	She said, like, can I can I get some money? And I was actually I was like, I did.
2937500	2941300	Literally, I I gave all my money to another person. I'm sorry.
2941300	2949900	And she said, she said, we're crackheads. We're homeless.
2949900	2952900	And then she walked away with her with her male friend.
2952900	2955700	She said, be really choosier around here.
2961660	2967660	That's fucking interesting because the first lady just wanted booze.
2967740	2973300	She needs crack. I don't know. It's weird. It's like, what?
2973300	2977140	When are you a good guy? When are you a bad guy? You don't you don't just like what?
2977140	2978980	Just panhandling in general.
2978980	2981740	Spencer told me once we should bring out Spencer in a second. Spencer.
2981740	2984740	Spencer Crittenton, he doesn't give to panhandlers.
2984740	2988260	He told me once what he does do. He kills.
2988260	2991420	I don't have the balls to do this.
2991420	2996300	When he sees the guys in L.A., I don't know if this is like in every city, but in L.A.,
2996300	3002500	there's like we have a infrastructure that supports like guys rolling down the street
3002500	3007260	with a shopping cart full of tin cans like they go from door to door.
3007260	3013980	They're fucking working hard, way harder than any of us work, getting like very little shit
3013980	3017820	to give to a corporation that gives them a couple of pennies for their tin cans.
3017820	3021460	And Spencer said he doesn't give to panhandlers.
3021460	3023780	When he sees those guys, those guys aren't even asking for money.
3023780	3028300	Spencer pulls over, runs out, gives offers them money.
3028300	3029460	I love it.
3029460	3033620	I mean, it's that seems like Spencer was like, but it's almost Darwinian, too.
3033620	3037460	It's creepy. It's like, like, yeah, the so the other people should.
3037460	3040380	Should they die?
3040380	3042380	What are we saying? Are we?
3042380	3045740	Oh, that he knows work, I think.
3045740	3047780	Give him money so that we can keep the.
3047780	3052540	I'm from L.A., like you see you see a guy laying in the street in L.A., a homeless person
3052540	3055060	and they're laying in L.A., it's a nice climate.
3055060	3059380	But you see somebody on the streets in Portland like it's cold out like like like like it's
3059380	3061180	weird to be like homeless here.
3061180	3067260	In Milwaukee, every year, it's the second coldest city or the first coldest city, depending
3067260	3068260	on who you ask.
3068260	3071900	If you ask somebody in Minneapolis, they'll tell you.
3071900	3074380	It's they die.
3074380	3079740	Yeah, they there's a homeless population and they die every winter.
3079740	3083460	They die off like mosquitoes.
3083460	3084940	It's not I'm not making a joke.
3084940	3087620	I'm saying like, like, that's the horrible thing.
3087620	3089180	So human beings, they die.
3089180	3091140	You called homeless people mosquitoes.
3091140	3092620	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3092620	3097660	That's I'm saying that's the fucking horrible thing.
3097660	3100140	They die off.
3100140	3102580	It's the horrible thing is like it's a part of a biosphere.
3102580	3107060	When you see somebody that's homeless and someone sleeping on the like I walked across
3107060	3110580	the bridge from the southwest side to downtown.
3110580	3115180	And it's just people like sleeping on the middle of the bridge on the on the thing.
3115180	3117420	And you you just walk by them.
3117420	3118420	It's so weird.
3118420	3119700	So you get other shit to do.
3119700	3123300	That's the way you don't you don't have I know you shouldn't have anything to do.
3123300	3127500	You say like if we if we if you were playing a video game and you had like people walking
3127500	3132180	everywhere and there were some of them that were like laying down, you would dedicate
3132180	3135100	all your energy until you had that moving up.
3135100	3138740	That's the liberal perspective is that a society should be judged by how you treat
3138740	3141380	your your your lowest.
3141380	3145380	I just think it's we live in a world where people think that life is a competition and
3145380	3147660	that when you see that they're losing, they're losing.
3147660	3153220	And so for me to identify with you, it means I would have to lower myself in that in that
3153220	3154220	chess game.
3154220	3155220	I hate it.
3155220	3156220	It's the worst.
3156220	3157220	Yeah.
3157220	3158220	Yeah.
3158220	3159220	I don't know.
3159220	3160220	I don't think that makes sense.
3160220	3161220	Spencer out.
3161220	3162220	Spencer.
3162220	3163220	Homeless deaths.
3163220	3164220	Homeless deaths.
3164220	3165220	Homeless deaths.
3165220	3166220	Every winner.
3166220	3167220	It's a culling.
3167220	3168220	Homeless deaths.
3168220	3169220	Homeless deaths.
3169220	3170220	What do you think?
3170220	3176220	What do you what do you what do you make of this situation with with panhandling the homeless?
3176220	3177220	The what?
3177220	3178220	What?
3178220	3179220	What?
3179220	3180220	What?
3180220	3181220	What?
3181220	3182220	What?
3182220	3183220	What?
3183220	3184220	What?
3184220	3185220	Well, yeah, it is Darwinian.
3185220	3187220	You encourage the people who are working and you let the others, you know, be cold.
3187220	3188220	That's what you're saying.
3188220	3190220	You're saying how do you feel about like mental illness?
3190220	3193220	And what do you I'm against it.
3193220	3194220	Wow.
3194220	3195220	Strong stand.
3195220	3196220	I'm sure some people make it work.
3196220	3197220	But, you know, what is it?
3197220	3198220	I mean, what is it?
3198220	3199220	What is it?
3199220	3200220	What is it?
3200220	3201220	What is it?
3201220	3202220	What is it?
3202220	3203220	What is it?
3203220	3204220	What is it?
3204220	3205220	What is it?
3205220	3206220	What is it?
3206220	3207220	What is it?
3207220	3208220	What is it?
3208220	3209220	What is it?
3210220	3211220	What is it?
3211220	3217220	I mean, one day, you know, any day now they're going to come up with a pill.
3217220	3218220	Yeah.
3218220	3219220	And they're going to go.
3219220	3220220	This cure is blank.
3220220	3221220	I'm planning.
3221220	3224220	And and they're going to.
3224220	3227220	It's going to be like, oh, that's great.
3227220	3229220	Tim used to talk to the fire hydrant.
3229220	3231220	Now he doesn't think that fire hydrants talk.
3231220	3233220	Lincoln Flamin is schizophrenic.
3233220	3235220	That's fantastic.
3235220	3241220	But then they're going to say they're going to look at Spencer and Aaron and Jeff and me.
3241220	3247220	And they're going to go, by the way, you could you wouldn't you wouldn't get hurt by taking this either.
3247220	3249220	You don't talk to fire hydrants.
3249220	3255220	However, you you do cry when you're watching Tron.
3255220	3257220	That's weird.
3257220	3258220	Don't do that.
3258220	3260220	You shouldn't cry when you're watching Tron.
3260220	3261220	That's dumb.
3261220	3263220	What part of Tron makes you cry?
3264220	3270220	Well, I'm crying is not a mental imbalance.
3270220	3271220	That's true.
3271220	3273220	The light cycle part.
3273220	3276220	What's sad about that part?
3276220	3280220	Just sometimes you get cut off and sometimes you cut other people off.
3280220	3283220	There's no way out of a light cycle race.
3283220	3286220	I love the new Tron.
3286220	3287220	No, I don't.
3287220	3289220	I love that.
3289220	3290220	No one has ever said that.
3290220	3292220	In the new Tron, there's a guy.
3292220	3298220	Even though you're in a computer, there's still a guy at the arena that goes, well, hello.
3298220	3301220	Welcome to the bleeding time.
3301220	3304220	There's still a guy in the computer.
3304220	3307220	That's like the Tron arena guy.
3307220	3311220	It's like, whoa, who wants to kill folks?
3311220	3312220	Wait, wait.
3312220	3313220	Why is everything always?
3313220	3317220	Why is there always an MC in a post-apocalypse?
3317220	3320220	Why is there always a Richard Dawson in a running man?
3320220	3324220	Who wants some violets?
3324220	3326220	The audience is like, yeah, we love violets.
3326220	3330220	The new Tron has a scene like the Thunderdome.
3330220	3334220	He's like, oh, boy, I know why you came here.
3334220	3335220	Who are you talking to?
3335220	3337220	They're all computer programs.
3337220	3338220	Why are you doing this?
3338220	3343220	Why do you have a computer program in your computer whose job is to wear a weird hat
3343220	3347220	and go like, whoa, boy, whoa, you're going to love this one?
3347220	3349220	That guy was the karaoke host, right?
3349220	3351220	He just transitioned.
3351220	3353220	There was a need for the Thunderdome host.
3353220	3355220	He's just like the local host.
3355220	3359220	But the original Tron, there was just a guy that was like your drill instructor who said,
3359220	3364220	if you lose your identity disk, you'll be subject to automatic de-resolution.
3364220	3365220	Yeah.
3365220	3368220	There's always a guy, any world that has to be redefined,
3368220	3373220	there's always a guy that is the voice of the sensational need for bloodlust.
3373220	3375220	You'd be that guy, Jeff.
3375220	3378220	Yeah.
3378220	3379220	You're getting a hosting thing.
3379220	3380220	Give me a noun.
3380220	3381220	Someone say a noun.
3381220	3382220	Banjo.
3382220	3383220	Banjo.
3383220	3384220	Banjo world.
3384220	3386220	Jeff, what would the...
3386220	3394220	If you lose your banjo strings, you'll be subject to automatic detuning.
3394220	3399220	See?
3399220	3403220	That was more low res than I wanted to.
3403220	3404220	Low res.
3404220	3408220	It's banjo world, but what's the fucking banjo world?
3408220	3413220	In the world of banjos, there are four types of strings.
3413220	3418220	The strings that adapt, the strings that don't adapt,
3419220	3423220	the strings that snap, and the strings that...
3423220	3426220	Are lost.
3426220	3427220	Not Jeff.
3427220	3429220	All right.
3429220	3430220	Okay, all right.
3430220	3432220	Do you want me to throw one at you?
3432220	3433220	No, no.
3433220	3434220	Do you want me to give you one?
3434220	3435220	Yeah, okay.
3435220	3436220	All right.
3436220	3439220	You're the fascist propagandist lord?
3439220	3445220	I'm the emcee of the arena in a blank world.
3446220	3451220	There's a futuristic world modeled on Chuck E. Cheese restaurants.
3455220	3458220	Hello whiskers and ears.
3458220	3462220	Welcome to the cheese.
3462220	3463220	All right, you're right.
3463220	3464220	It's hard.
3464220	3465220	It's hard.
3465220	3466220	You're right.
3466220	3467220	It's just a...
3467220	3468220	Never mind.
3468220	3469220	Sorry.
3469220	3470220	Sorry about that.
3470220	3472220	You won't hear me admit I was wrong a lot.
3472220	3474220	I had to walk a mile in his magazines.
3474220	3475220	Spencer here.
3475220	3476220	Spencer, this is your gift.
3476220	3477220	I know.
3477220	3478220	Chuck E. Cheese.
3478220	3479220	This is a blessing from God, Dan.
3479220	3480220	What the fuck?
3480220	3481220	Oh, do it.
3481220	3482220	Fucking do it, then.
3482220	3483220	Okay.
3483220	3484220	You're the Chuck E. Cheese propagandist.
3484220	3485220	No, I'm going to ruin it for karma purposes.
3485220	3486220	Here we go.
3486220	3490220	Everybody, you have to play the character of the bloodthirsty crowd, though.
3494220	3501220	All new people must have hand stamps for their parents.
3501220	3505220	You'll be crushed by the ball bits.
3505220	3510220	You only get six tokens, so use them wisely.
3510220	3518220	You may choose to pool your tickets to get a worthwhile prize or spend it all on tootsie
3518220	3519220	rolls.
3519220	3520220	There.
3520220	3521220	That's good.
3521220	3522220	All right.
3522220	3524220	God damn it.
3524220	3527220	I hope you remember us when you're in charge.
3527220	3528220	What?
3528220	3531220	I said, I hope you remember us when you're in charge.
3531220	3532220	All right.
3532220	3533220	So, yeah.
3533220	3534220	No, I'm out.
3534220	3535220	James Adomian's not here, right?
3535220	3536220	Fuck that guy.
3536220	3537220	Never showed up.
3537220	3538220	No.
3538220	3539220	That fucking cock.
3539220	3540220	Would have been good, man.
3540220	3543220	I would have done a rap and then he would have been like, spiders delight.
3543220	3545220	And then I would have kept rapping.
3545220	3546220	We could still do it.
3546220	3548220	I already tried to rap.
3548220	3551220	I like your Vincent Price breakdowns more than anybody's.
3551220	3556220	But I have to rap and then I have to also do the Vincent Price.
3557220	3560220	It provides a nice break from the rapping to get into that.
3560220	3561220	All right.
3561220	3562220	Just one taste.
3562220	3565220	Just to show them how bad I am.
3565220	3566220	All right.
3566220	3572220	Let me do just a little lick.
3572220	3573220	Yeah.
3573220	3574220	Yeah.
3574220	3575220	Yeah.
3575220	3576220	Yeah.
3576220	3577220	Yeah.
3577220	3578220	Yeah.
3578220	3579220	Yeah.
3579220	3580220	Yeah.
3580220	3581220	Yeah.
3581220	3582220	Yeah.
3582220	3583220	Yeah.
3583220	3584220	Yeah.
3584220	3585220	Yeah.
3585220	3586220	I can't write those words.
3586220	3588220	They're just, they're just like, fuck your mama in a lazy way.
3588220	3591220	Improvising lyrics all day.
3591220	3594220	Fuck your mama Monday to Tuesday.
3594220	3595220	That was stupid.
3595220	3596220	Dumb.
3596220	3597220	Hold on.
3597220	3598220	Let me start.
3598220	3602220	It's a, it's a bad beat for, uh, for a visit price.
3602220	3604220	It was pretty frenetic.
3604220	3608220	Everyone said that's a price of ones in the audience.
3608220	3609220	Okay.

3662220	3664220	She was like Amanda Pete.
3664220	3667220	I think that's an actress.
3667220	3671220	I fucked your mama on a Clive Barker mattress.
3672220	3677220	When the blood went down, it resurrected a zombie man and he came to town.
3677220	3678220	Yo.
3678220	3681220	It's time for a new franchise.

3686220	3687220	Thank you.
3687220	3693220	Someone went to Hellraiser and thought that needles were French fries and misunderstood.

3729220	3730220	My name was Billie Jean.
3730220	3733220	I was like Michael Jackson with a glowing sidewalk.
3733220	3735220	I fucked your mama so hard.
3735220	3736220	She cyclops.
3736220	3738220	I already said that.
3738220	3739220	I said that before.
3739220	3740220	Don't.
3740220	3741220	Oh.
3741220	3742220	You just started a new beat.
3742220	3743220	God damn it.
3743220	3744220	All right.
3744220	3745220	All right.
3745220	3746220	Thanks sweetie.

3759220	3760220	She ate curds and whey.
3760220	3761220	She's like Little Miss Mappa.
3761220	3762220	Then the spider came down.
3762220	3763220	Fuck your mama in her makeup.
3763220	3764220	She looked like a clown.
3764220	3765220	Fuck your inner eye.
3765220	3766220	Fuck your inner ear.
3766220	3767220	Fuck your mama so hard.
3767220	3768220	She couldn't hear.
3768220	3769220	My dick went through her brain.
3769220	3770220	She went downtown on the train.
3770220	3771220	She went to work and made a good wage.
3771220	3772220	Fuck your mama so hard.
3772220	3773220	She rosemary sage.
3773220	3774220	She used those things when she was cooking.
3774220	3775220	She's tingling.
3775220	3776220	Don't apologize.
3776220	3777220	No.
3777220	3778220	No.
3778220	3779220	I'm not apologizing.
3779220	3780220	Sorry.
3780220	3781220	Sorry.
3782220	3783220	Yo.
3783220	3784220	I'm sorry.
3784220	3785220	Yo.
3785220	3786220	Yo.
3786220	3787220	Sorry.
3787220	3788220	Sorry.
3788220	3789220	Yo.
3789220	3790220	Yo.
3790220	3791220	Fuck your mama in the kitchen in the bathroom.
3791220	3793220	Fuck your mama in the...
3793220	3796220	That's always the last room that you look in when you find your mama.
3796220	3798220	She's trying to hide from me like a llama.
3798220	3800220	Llamas are notorious for hiding from people.
3800220	3802220	Fuck your mama in the church in the steeple.
3802220	3804220	Fuck your mama in the belfry in the tower.
3804220	3806220	Fuck your mama in the church in the steeple.
3806220	3808220	Fuck your mama in the church in the steeple.
3808220	3810220	Fuck your mama in the belfry in the tower.
3810220	3812220	Fuck your mama so hard.
3812220	3813220	She took a shower.
3813220	3815220	And she rolled and cried.
3815220	3818220	And she washed it off the things and...
3818220	3821220	God damn it.
3821220	3823220	We just gotta get to the Vincent Price Bridge.
3823220	3824220	All right.
3824220	3825220	Yo.
3825220	3826220	Yo.
3826220	3827220	Yo.
3827220	3828220	Yo.
3828220	3829220	Yo.
3829220	3831220	Let's cool it down and get to the streets.
3831220	3833220	Fuck your mama in her armpits.
3833220	3835220	Fuck your inner feets.
3835220	3837220	I fucked your mama all day.
3837220	3840220	I didn't want to do it any way.
3840220	3842220	But she begged me.
3842220	3843220	She told me to do it.
3843220	3845220	Fuck your mama so hard.
3845220	3846220	Her name was...
3846220	3847220	Ray Pruitt.
3847220	3848220	It's a...
3848220	3850220	It's a friend of ours.
3852220	3854220	That's a weird shout out.
3854220	3856220	Trust me.
3856220	3857220	Trust me.
3857220	3859220	It's a good rhyme.
3859220	3863220	Fuck your mama upstairs in the basement.
3863220	3864220	Fuck your mama...
3864220	3865220	Nothing.
3866220	3867220	Placement.
3867220	3868220	This is stupid.
3868220	3869220	Give me a second.
3869220	3870220	Hold on.
3870220	3871220	Yo.
3871220	3872220	Portland.
3872220	3873220	Yo.
3873220	3876220	Trees, redwoods, and vines.
3876220	3879220	Fuck your mama till she started to feel fine.
3879220	3882220	Fuck your mama all across the nation.
3882220	3884220	Fuck your mama so hard.
3884220	3886220	She gave up masturbation.
3886220	3888220	She always kept coming to me.
3888220	3890220	She said, give me some more.
3890220	3892220	You never gave me so much, you see.
3892220	3895220	I said, okay, one more this time.
3895220	3898220	But I'm gonna put it into my next rhyme.
3898220	3901220	She said, don't mention me by name.
3901220	3903220	I said, yo, you're just another mama.
3903220	3905220	They're all the same.
3905220	3907220	I'm just gonna say your mama.
3907220	3909220	She's like, that's cool.
3909220	3912220	Even though my name is Talama.
3912220	3915220	It's okay to make up a word like that.
3915220	3916220	Fuck.
3916220	3917220	God damn it.
3917220	3919220	All right.
3919220	3920220	That's a price.
3920220	3921220	That's a price.
3921220	3922220	That's a price.
3922220	3923220	No, no, no, no, no.
3923220	3925220	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
3925220	3928220	Say a word, sir.
3928220	3929220	Bridge.
3929220	3930220	Bridge, okay.
3930220	3933220	Yo, yo, bridge is from ocean to ocean.
3933220	3936220	Fuck your mama so hard because of my motion.
3936220	3939220	A bridge doesn't ever change.
3939220	3941220	It doesn't go over an ocean.
3941220	3944220	That would be the biggest bridge in the world.
3944220	3946220	Just give me a second.
3946220	3949220	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3950220	3953220	I fucked your mama in the middle of a bridge.
3953220	3956220	I fucked your mama and her pussy had a ridge.
3956220	3959220	I looked down and I said, what is that?
3959220	3962220	She said, oh, that's a little tiny man's hat.
3962220	3965220	I said, don't talk down to me.
3965220	3967220	She said, well, it's the clitoris.
3967220	3970220	Like, do, do, do, do.
3970220	3971220	Look it up.
3974220	3976220	And I did.
3976220	3980220	And I learned how to love in a different kind of way.
3980220	3983220	From God above and unifying with her,
3983220	3986220	we were two people just hanging out.
3986220	3987220	Fuck it.
3987220	3989220	All right, all right.
3989220	3991220	There's a price.
3991220	3996220	Spiders coming everywhere.
3996220	4001220	Spider come, going, crawling all over the place.
4001220	4004220	Tears of zombie infants.
4004220	4007220	Dug themselves out of holes.
4007220	4010220	Third world countries.
4010220	4014220	Feeling terrible about themselves.
4014220	4017220	Vincent Price.
4017220	4023220	Bringing the morbidity into popular music.
4023220	4025220	Dan Harmon, everybody.
4025220	4028220	All right, well, I feel like, okay.
4029220	4033220	I feel like we failed at that.
4033220	4036220	And unless the rest of the show goes well,
4036220	4039220	you can all have your money back.
4039220	4043220	And you can talk to Squarespace about it.
4043220	4045220	I thought it was great.
4045220	4049220	I say play a bit of D&D for these people before we go.
4052220	4055220	Let's get the character sheets dispensed.
4055220	4056220	Yep.
4056220	4057220	Yeah.
4057220	4059220	I'm sorry about that.
4059220	4063220	No, every young girl at some point thinks that her clitoris is a tiny hat.
4070220	4072220	All right.
4072220	4078220	Now Spencer, it's been a real long time since I have any idea what we're doing.
4078220	4081220	Yeah, yeah.
4081220	4084220	But I mean, usually you guys don't have an excuse.
4084220	4091220	Well, that one was a thinker apparently.
4091220	4095220	All right, Spencer, catch us up to date if you can and if you will.
4095220	4098220	Spencer, what's the weirdest thing that's happened to you in Portland?
4098220	4101220	Wait, cut the Dungeon Master music.
4101220	4106220	So, okay, when we got here, Aaron, you know, gave me a donut, one of those donuts.
4106220	4107220	I like it.
4107220	4108220	It was good.
4108220	4109220	It was a jelly donut.
4109220	4111220	I don't really like jelly donuts.
4111220	4115220	So, I dropped my stuff off in the hotel then I got to register.
4115220	4119220	I got my wristband and stuff and then went back to my room to take a dump.
4119220	4125220	And I was sitting on the toilet and I was glancing around as you do.
4125220	4128220	And I saw a waste paper basket.
4128220	4133220	And, you know, hotel cleaners, they clean up things before the guests arrive and stuff.
4133220	4139220	So, little was, I mean, large was my surprise when I saw there was apparently something
4139220	4143220	in one of these waste paper baskets and I was like, ugh, that's weird.
4143220	4146220	I feel like the story could only be enhanced by this.
4146220	4148220	I mean, probably not, but whatever.
4148220	4150220	Then, you were right.
4150220	4152220	I take it all back.
4152220	4161220	So, I slowly tip the waste paper basket towards me to allow myself to see into its depths.
4161220	4168220	And I see it looks like a tissue paper and inside it's just all red.
4169220	4172220	And I'm like, okay, I guess that happens.
4172220	4173220	You know, it's natural.
4173220	4174220	That happens.
4174220	4176220	Put it somewhere.
4176220	4178220	It's like I always say.
4178220	4182220	And so, but I was really grossed out and I was like, did they just not clean my room?
4182220	4184220	What's going on?
4184220	4189220	And then I looked at it further and I was like, oh, that's just the jelly donut I threw away.
4192220	4196220	Portland is amazing.
4197220	4199220	What a roller coaster ride.
4199220	4201220	Menstruation on the line.
4201220	4205220	We thought we found the one bad thing about Portland.
4205220	4210220	It's really just a place you can come to confront your own love of donuts.
4210220	4213220	Spencer has his eyes out for dirty tampons.
4213220	4216220	Well, it's everything so pristine.
4216220	4220220	You know, if you see something in a waste paper basket and you don't remember throwing it in there,
4220220	4221220	it's really terrifying.
4221220	4225220	I got to say, whoever is in charge of cleaning our hotel room here at the Bridgeport Comedy Festival,
4225220	4230220	the Jupiter Hotel, I'm so sorry for my fiance, Erin.
4230220	4231220	What happened?
4231220	4232220	I don't know.
4232220	4237220	She's like, the trail she leaves is Belushian.
4237220	4239220	You admit that, right?
4239220	4244220	Like you, like there's crumbs everywhere.
4244220	4248220	I just like to see everything I have at once.
4248220	4254220	When Erin goes into a hotel room, she opens the suitcase and just like,
4254220	4261220	it's like spores, like everything from inside her suitcase explodes to every edge of the room.
4261220	4266220	I definitely have like a weird thing with hotels where I'm like, I can do anything.
4266220	4268220	Do you hate the people that clean up?
4268220	4269220	No, no, I don't.
4269220	4273220	And I used to work as a maid, but I always liked it with...
4273220	4274220	What?
4274220	4275220	Yeah.
4275220	4276220	Really?
4276220	4278220	Yeah, for like two years during college, I worked as a maid.
4278220	4281220	Maid in America was the name of the company.
4281220	4283220	No, no, get it?
4283220	4284220	Yeah.
4284220	4285220	I love you.
4285220	4286220	Yeah.
4286220	4287220	And I did some...
4287220	4288220	This guy.
4288220	4289220	I did some weird shit.
4289220	4292220	But I clean people's stuff.
4292220	4294220	She did some weird shit.
4294220	4299220	But I don't, you know, just like clutter, I feel isn't a big deal.
4299220	4304220	Like I think the gross thing, like if I was leaving nail clippings or like hair, like that's hard to...
4304220	4307220	What about just Chex Mix everywhere?
4307220	4308220	Well, last night...
4308220	4311220	Just a bag of Chex Mix just systematically like laid out all over the floor.
4311220	4315220	I was very drunk and I thought I was a hero for taking a bag of Chex Mix and...
4315220	4316220	Pouring it.
4316220	4317220	Trying to eat it.
4317220	4319220	I literally poured it.
4319220	4320220	I got back...
4320220	4323220	I was the last one at the after party last night.
4323220	4324220	Literally the last one.
4324220	4326220	And I got back to the room and I was like, oh no.
4326220	4328220	Like tomorrow is going to be a disaster.
4328220	4334220	And so I got in bed and I got my iPad and I started playing this movie that I started watching on the plane.
4334220	4340220	And I took the Chex Mix and I just put it on my bare chest.
4340220	4347220	And I don't even think use my hands, it's just like...
4347220	4348220	This is...
4348220	4350220	We're getting married!
4350220	4351220	All right, all right.
4351220	4352220	Spencer...
4352220	4353220	That's the woman I'm going to love.
4353220	4355220	Spencer, let's play some D&D.
4355220	4359220	I just want to hear it.
4359220	4365220	I don't pretend to be Audrey Hepburn.
4365220	4366220	All right.
4366220	4368220	What do you got?
4368220	4369220	What do you think about Portland?
4369220	4370220	It's a great city.
4370220	4371220	Yeah.
4371220	4372220	A lot of bridges.
4372220	4373220	A lot of bridges.
4373220	4374220	Okay, whatever.
4374220	4375220	Really easy.
4375220	4376220	What about the spit?
4376220	4377220	To cross water.
4377220	4378220	It's funny for me to keep interrupting.
4378220	4379220	Bodies of water.
4379220	4380220	Is it?
4380220	4381220	There's lots of water.
4381220	4382220	It's funny.
4382220	4383220	Last time on Harmony.
4383220	4384220	Harmony!
4384220	4387220	Our heroes had teamed up with Meredith the Minotaur to escape the underworld and soon
4387220	4389220	came upon Bill Mardigan's.
4389220	4392220	The city that's everywhere.
4392220	4397220	With the help of Whizbulb and his bucket, our heroes met with Spizwad the curse breaker,
4397220	4401220	who demanded cigarettes in exchange for magical healing.
4401220	4404220	So it was off to the cigarette museum.
4404220	4409220	Despite Sharpie's initial resistance, he quickly rose to the challenge, teleporting
4409220	4412220	inside the closed museum.
4412220	4417220	But as soon as he was inside, he encountered a massive bust of butts.
4417220	4421220	A giant head made of cigarettes, Bill Mardigan himself.
4421220	4426220	The smoking cigarette deity was upset about the trespass, but Sharpie seemed to calm
4426220	4429220	him down through level-headed discussion.
4429220	4433220	As Quark and Christoperg arrived, the gang was worried, and they soon found themselves
4433220	4438220	enjoying both the smoke of Bill Mardigan's and the magical restorative effects it had,
4438220	4440220	lifting their skull curses.
4440220	4445220	But with their curses lifted, our heroes still sought the magical tarragon to exercise
4445220	4446220	Christoperg.
4446220	4447220	But how would they get it?
4447220	4449220	Inside of a bag?
4449220	4450220	I don't know.
4450220	4452220	Probably not there.
4452220	4453220	Find out.
4453220	4458220	That's where we were.
4458220	4461220	Do you have any questions?
4461220	4465220	There's a giant head made of cigarettes.
4465220	4466220	That's memorable, right?
4466220	4467220	Yeah, it's good.
4467220	4470220	I was very distracted by the lighting.
4470220	4473220	Yeah, I'm dynamically lit.
4473220	4474220	I'm iridescent.
4474220	4477220	I examine the cigarette head.
4477220	4479220	He's still chilling out.
4479220	4485220	He's kind of eyeing you, smoke issues from his mouth, and he's like, what up?
4485220	4488220	Do you know where the tarragon of virtue is?
4488220	4490220	That's up in paradise somewhere, right?
4490220	4492220	Do you know where to get there?
4492220	4493220	No.
4493220	4494220	Shit.
4494220	4497220	What are you looking for?
4497220	4499220	The tarragon of virtue.
4499220	4500220	That's weird.
4500220	4502220	Well, we were trying to get cigarettes.
4502220	4504220	That's why we...
4504220	4506220	I apologize.
4506220	4513220	We came in here to get cigarettes because there were these other guys that I can't remember.
4513220	4516220	It was like six months ago.
4516220	4517220	That's okay.
4517220	4520220	Were you born this way?
4520220	4522220	That's a great question.
4522220	4523220	No, I was not.
4523220	4528220	I built this city with my own two hands, and I oversaw it with the best of my ability.
4528220	4530220	But soon I realized it was not enough.
4530220	4536220	That drive that powered me to empower this city granted me this form and immortality
4536220	4541220	with which I could maintain and upkeep the workings of Bill Martigans.
4541220	4544220	What are you into?
4544220	4547220	I like smoking and riddles.
4547220	4550220	You like hot tubs?
4550220	4558220	No, that really puts me out.
4559220	4561220	Well-deserved pun.
4561220	4565220	Why do we want cigarettes again?
4565220	4567220	The other guy, it's like...
4567220	4569220	Who wanted cigarettes?
4569220	4570220	DM's note.
4570220	4574220	You guys were trying to get the skull curses lifted, but in meeting with Bill Martigan,
4574220	4577220	he actually cured you of your skull curses.
4577220	4579220	Okay, so we're fine.
4579220	4581220	From this point, we can do whatever we want.
4581220	4589220	We do want the tarragon of virtue to get Christa Berg's curse lifted, I think, right?
4589220	4591220	Sure.
4591220	4593220	Hey, smokey...
4593220	4594220	Bill Martigan.
4594220	4595220	Bill Martigan.
4595220	4596220	The name of the city.
4596220	4600220	Have you ever wanted to travel the world with adventurers?
4600220	4605220	No, I kind of just want to, you know, be God over my city.
4605220	4607220	I know you love riddles.
4607220	4608220	Yes.
4608220	4614220	If you answer this riddle correctly, we'll let you show us to the tarragon of virtue.
4614220	4616220	I like those odds.
4616220	4619220	It's gonna work.
4619220	4632220	All right, what is small and red and blue but never sleeps?
4632220	4634220	Red butt blue?
4634220	4635220	And blue.
4635220	4636220	Oh, red and blue.
4636220	4640220	It's small, red and blue and never sleeps.
4640220	4642220	Well, camp you.
4642220	4644220	Maybe...
4644220	4645220	Purple family.
4645220	4650220	Bill Martigan's rumblings are suddenly interrupted by a sharp, high-pitched siren.
4650220	4653220	It sounds like, wee-woo, wee-woo, wee-woo.
4653220	4657220	Oh my God, the most adorable emergency is happening.
4657220	4664220	You see the flashing of blue and red lights, which is coincidental.
4664220	4667220	Bill Martigan, are there people coming?
4667220	4668220	Oh, shit.
4668220	4669220	That's the fuzz.
4669220	4671220	You better get out of here.
4671220	4673220	But you own this place.
4673220	4675220	Yep, but they don't know I exist.
4675220	4676220	He wants.
4676220	4677220	Whoa.
4677220	4680220	Guys, let's jump back in the bucket and get out of here.
4680220	4681220	Portable hole.
4681220	4682220	Portal bucket.
4682220	4683220	Portable hole.
4683220	4685220	Bill Martigan goes...
4685220	4686220	Oh, shit.
4686220	4692220	And all the cigarettes that compose his form are sucked, you know, to their butts or whatever.
4692220	4693220	Sucked to their butts.
4693220	4696220	He falls to the ground in a pile of ash, and you hear his voice,
4696220	4697220	Good luck.
4699220	4702220	I put the ash in a little bag, and I put it in my pocket.
4702220	4704220	You obtain Bill Martigan's ashes.
4709220	4710220	Don't worry, guys, I got it.
4710220	4713220	I have a portable...
4713220	4716220	If you get into a portable hole, if you climb into one,
4716220	4719220	can you just fold it up from inside and just hang out?
4719220	4720220	I don't think so.
4720220	4722220	Someone on the outside could do that, though.
4722220	4725220	But we could jump back through the portal, right?
4725220	4730220	Yeah, you have a bucket with you, Jeff, that goes to this gnome bathroom.
4730220	4731220	All right, fine.
4731220	4735220	Let's all go to the weird bathroom.
4736220	4739220	I jump into the bucket of bathrooms.
4740220	4741220	You do that.
4741220	4742220	What about you guys?
4742220	4744220	I also jump in.
4744220	4746220	Through the bucket of bathrooms.
4746220	4748220	You find yourself in a nice bathroom.
4748220	4750220	There's something you've never seen before.
4750220	4753220	It's a weird chamber pot made of porcelain.
4753220	4755220	It's got a little handle on it.
4755220	4758220	I open it and look into the contents.
4758220	4761220	There's butt...but water in a hole.
4761220	4763220	I put my hand in the hole.
4764220	4768220	It feels...it fits your fist just exactly as if it was made for it.
4768220	4771220	I go like, this is a good chamber pot.
4772220	4776220	I go to the door of this room and open it up.
4776220	4779220	You open it up and you see it's covered in clutter.
4779220	4780220	It's all just paper.
4780220	4781220	There's nothing useful.
4781220	4784220	Can I ask you...I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
4784220	4785220	Tons of paper.
4785220	4790220	Can I ask you a sidebar question about my character?
4790220	4791220	Yeah, sure.
4791220	4793220	Do I have to poop?
4793220	4795220	That's really up to you, man.
4795220	4796220	Is it?
4796220	4797220	I mean...
4797220	4798220	Are you kidding me?
4798220	4799220	Yeah.
4799220	4800220	That's crazy.
4800220	4802220	Okay, I have to poop.
4803220	4804220	You have to poop.
4804220	4805220	It's up to me?
4805220	4806220	It's up to me.
4806220	4809220	I tell these guys, like, it's up to me when I have to poop.
4809220	4812220	I want you to know that about me.
4812220	4814220	You should try and see if you can...
4814220	4817220	There may be situations where that comes to our advantage.
4817220	4819220	This probably isn't one, but I want you to know.
4819220	4824220	I am different from every being on Middle Earth.
4824220	4827220	It's up to me when I have to poop.
4827220	4828220	I'm like a dolphin.
4828220	4831220	Like a dolphin's heartbeat is voluntary.
4831220	4832220	What?
4832220	4833220	Yeah, that's true.
4833220	4834220	Dolphins?
4835220	4836220	They're going to remember to keep their heart beating.
4836220	4837220	What?
4837220	4838220	They can forget and die.
4838220	4839220	No.
4839220	4840220	Yeah.
4840220	4842220	If there's a dolphin in the audience, let him...
4842220	4848220	I saw a dolphin today on the fucking river.
4848220	4849220	It was going...
4849220	4850220	No.
4850220	4851220	Fuck you guys.
4851220	4852220	What was it then?
4852220	4853220	What was it, huh?
4853220	4854220	Sea lion.
4854220	4855220	Whatever.
4855220	4857220	That's just as magnificent.
4857220	4858220	What?
4858220	4859220	What is he...
4859220	4860220	Whatever.
4860220	4862220	You thought it might have been a dolphin?
4862220	4867740	It's a fucking gray, dark, shiny object coming in and out of the water for air every couple
4867740	4868740	of minutes.
4868740	4870740	The most incredible thing is that the audience is like, no.
4870740	4871740	Well, also, no.
4871740	4872740	History science is weird.
4872740	4873740	Like, why would he...
4873740	4875740	Like, it's a gray, dark shape coming out of...
4875740	4878220	It could have been your friend from college.
4878220	4879220	No, it couldn't have.
4879220	4882220	It had a very distinguished fin.
4882220	4885220	Did you hear the College of Sea World?
4885220	4886220	Wait, all right.
4886220	4887220	See a lot.
4887220	4888220	Anyway.
4888220	4889220	Wait, sea lions don't have dorsal fins.
4889220	4893220	Well, I guess it might have been a dolphin then.
4893220	4896220	Oh, shit.
4896220	4901220	Everyone is way more upset about this than I am.
4901220	4906220	Well, it's weird to assume you saw a dolphin just because you saw a gray thing.
4906220	4908220	Wait, is there a possibility?
4908220	4909220	This is fresh water, right?
4909220	4910220	Not likely, no.
4910220	4911220	A dolphin can't just be cruising down.
4911220	4914220	There's river dolphins, but I think those are enough dolphins.
4914220	4915220	I think we...
4915220	4916220	Those exist.
4916220	4917220	They're not river dolphins.
4917220	4918220	Those definitively exist.
4918220	4920220	There are no river dolphins.
4920220	4921220	Those are porpoises.
4921220	4923220	South America, someone's saying.
4923220	4924220	No.
4924220	4926220	When the river is so big, it's like an ocean.
4926220	4927220	I think we solved this in the first 10 seconds.
4927220	4928220	It was a sea lion.
4928220	4929220	Yeah, and I don't care.
4929220	4930220	It was a sea lion.
4930220	4931220	It was gorgeous.
4931220	4933220	But with a fin, with a dorsal fin.
4933220	4936220	Apparently.
4936220	4939220	That's what I saw.
4939220	4941220	Have you ever touched a dolphin?
4941220	4942220	No.
4942220	4943220	Sorry?
4943220	4945220	No.
4945220	4947220	Sharpie.
4947220	4955220	Just so I know, you said that there would be certain situations when you having to poop
4955220	4957220	would be advantageous for...
4957220	4958220	Well, later.
4958220	4959220	Later.
4959220	4960220	I don't know.
4960220	4961220	Could you just list some of them so I know it's not ready?
4961220	4962220	No, no, no.
4962220	4963220	No.
4963220	4967220	I sit down, Spencer, and I poop.
4967220	4969220	Because you said it's up to me.
4969220	4970220	Yeah.
4970220	4971220	I poop.
4971220	4975220	Now you can ask your questions while I'm pooping.
4975220	4976220	It's not a big bathroom.
4976220	4981220	You got to make eye contact with me.
4981220	4985220	I want you to lock eyes with me.
4985220	4989220	I'll tell you anything you want to hear.
4989220	4993220	But now, you need to know that I'm pooping while you talk to me.
4993220	4994220	I'm pooping.
4994220	4995220	All right.
4995220	4996220	Are you okay?
4996220	4997220	Yeah.
4997220	4998220	Yeah.
4998220	5000220	How are you?
5000220	5001220	Good.
5001220	5005220	Sharpie, what do you want to achieve in this lifetime?
5005220	5007220	I'd like to touch other people.
5007220	5012220	Like, I want them to know that I was here.
5012220	5020220	What do you want them to remember of you?
5020220	5026220	Honestly, I don't need them to think that I was good or bad.
5026220	5027220	I just want to be remembered.
5027220	5029220	I want to be specific.
5029220	5030220	I want them to...
5030220	5032220	I want to be irreplaceable.
5032220	5036220	I want to be singular.
5036220	5039220	Plop.
5039220	5042220	Plop.
5042220	5043220	I assume.
5043220	5045220	I mean, it's either up to you or to me.
5045220	5046220	I don't know.
5046220	5050220	When it falls, sure.
5050220	5055220	If you were to die today, what do you think people would remember you most for, Sharpie?
5055220	5056220	Oh, God.
5056220	5057220	I don't even...
5057220	5058220	I feel like they would...
5058220	5062220	I feel like too many, too few people would have known that I was around.
5062220	5064220	That's what terrifies me.
5064220	5068220	Maybe that skeleton army show on the bridge, that was...
5068220	5070220	Yeah, but I don't think those guys know my name.
5070220	5071220	I don't think they know...
5071220	5077220	Hold on a second.
5077220	5080220	I would just like to...
5080220	5084220	I feel like none of us get to live forever.
5084220	5085220	That's not the goal.
5085220	5087220	That's not a real life.
5087220	5090220	Don't take this personally, but I'm just going to back away five feet or so.
5090220	5091220	Does it stink?
5091220	5093220	Are you guys all in here?
5093220	5096220	We haven't even pooped in nine months.
5096220	5098220	It's a lot.
5098220	5099220	It's a lot.
5099220	5101220	There's a lot of traces of our adventures.
5101220	5105220	I walk out of the doorway to the restroom.
5105220	5106220	Okay.
5106220	5108220	You walk into this...
5108220	5110220	I keep pooping.
5110220	5113220	I keep watching.
5114220	5117220	Those things happen, all three of them.
5117220	5123220	And as you walk into this room, you see a pile of papery bits start to move and shift.
5123220	5126220	And you see a hand emerge, and then a face.
5126220	5129220	It's another gnome, believe it or not.
5129220	5131220	I'm Flizdam!
5131220	5134220	What you doing in here?
5134220	5137220	I also want to talk about Willis.
5137220	5138220	What?
5138220	5139220	Sorry.
5139220	5140220	Flizdam.
5140220	5142220	My name is Quirk.
5142220	5146220	My friend is rolling on deuce in the other room.
5146220	5148220	I'm watching!
5148220	5150220	This is all very upsetting.
5150220	5151220	Yeah.
5151220	5153220	I wouldn't call it rolling.
5156220	5158220	Am I supposed to say something?
5158220	5159220	No.
5159220	5160220	Flizdam.
5160220	5163220	We seek the pteragon of virtue.
5163220	5166220	Jesus Christ!
5168220	5171220	That's a person in this world.
5172220	5175220	You know, that grows on the Isle of Paradise.
5175220	5177220	Why am I having this conversation?
5177220	5178220	Who are you guys?
5178220	5182220	Well, you just get some guys that fell into a bucket of portal.
5182220	5184220	Oh, yeah.
5188220	5191220	Flizdam, I've got to be honest with you.
5191220	5194220	We're pretty drunk.
5194220	5196220	I mean, that's normal.
5196220	5198220	We don't always shut this up right now.
5198220	5200220	My friend's taking a shit.
5201220	5202220	I'm watching!
5202220	5204220	Yeah, my other friend's watching it.
5204220	5207220	I just had to take a breather and get out of there.
5209220	5210220	Yeah.
5210220	5212220	I feel like we should fight or something.
5212220	5213220	Fight.
5213220	5214220	What?
5214220	5215220	This is normal.
5215220	5216220	Hey.
5216220	5218220	You never adequately explained yourselves.
5218220	5219220	What?
5219220	5220220	No.
5220220	5221220	Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5221220	5222220	I leave.
5222220	5225220	I leave Sharpie and walk into the room with the paper and the gnome.
5225220	5226220	Flizdam.
5227220	5230220	I guess I knew you were behind there in theory.
5230220	5231220	Hey, listen.
5231220	5233220	Hey, buddy.
5233220	5235220	I'm taking a shit.
5236220	5238220	I can smell it.
5238220	5241220	Weird, gross.
5241220	5243220	We have no quarrel with you.
5243220	5246220	You look like a nice gnome.
5246220	5249220	Do you know where the Isle of Paradise is?
5249220	5251220	Yeah, yeah.
5251220	5253220	What are you afraid of?
5253220	5256220	This is a very weird circumstance.
5256220	5259220	Do you even own a home?
5259220	5261220	Are you a realtor?
5261220	5264220	What did we interrupt in this paper room?
5264220	5266220	This is my house.
5266220	5268220	Why is your house next to a bathroom?
5268220	5276220	Why is this so hard to fathom that I'm a bit weirded out by three people shitting in my bathroom?
5276220	5278220	None of you are gnomes.
5278220	5279220	One of you is a gnome.
5279220	5280220	That's not true.
5280220	5283220	One of your home invasion nightmares and an ad to it.
5283220	5290220	The idea that the people home invading don't acknowledge that they're doing anything wrong.
5290220	5291220	It would be scarier.
5291220	5292220	It would be scarier.
5292220	5296220	And yet you speak of the Isle of Paradise and the Tarragon of Virtue.
5296220	5298220	Flizdam, I'm so sorry.
5298220	5305220	We had a transporter bucket and that's why we're here.
5305220	5308220	And you seem so nice that I understand why you would be scared.
5308220	5309220	Will you accept this?
5309220	5313220	And I produce from my bag a God's eye made out of yarn.
5313220	5316220	I will.
5316220	5320220	This is a token of our friendship.
5320220	5321220	We'd like to be your friend.
5321220	5323220	You seem very nice and nervous.
5323220	5324220	Thank you.
5324220	5328220	I thought about it and I guess Whizbull just leaves his bucket anywhere.
5328220	5331220	He sure does.
5331220	5334220	That could happen.
5335220	5337220	You're out of...
5337220	5344220	I'm not sure you're out of it because I don't know if you use it but I'm done pooping.
5344220	5349220	And there's nothing in here but me and my poop.
5349220	5353220	Fliz, will you come with us on an adventure to the Isle of Paradise?
5353220	5360220	I might be able to help as I am part of a sacred order of the Seekers of Paradise.
5360220	5364220	Alright, no need to brag but please...
5364220	5365220	It's my life's work.
5365220	5367220	I think it's something to brag about.
5367220	5371220	You know, you're right.
5371220	5375220	Show us.
5375220	5378220	Can we grab some supplies from your kitchen?
5378220	5381220	Sure.
5381220	5383220	You're in the best.
5384220	5386220	Anybody...
5386220	5391220	Anything fabric or cloth?
5391220	5392220	Anything...
5392220	5394220	I have some thread in my bag.
5394220	5395220	I take out some thread.
5395220	5396220	Thread?
5396220	5397220	Yeah.
5397220	5399220	It's not going to be pretty but it will work.
5399220	5401220	It won't work.
5401220	5407220	You just got to wrap it around your hand so many times.
5407220	5411220	Speaking of wrap it around, I think that because we're getting close to our closing time,
5411220	5417220	I think that Sharpie might have to wrap the whole message up for us right now.
5417220	5418220	What kind of weird...
5418220	5419220	Sharpie wrap.
5419220	5420220	Sharpie wrap.
5420220	5421220	Sharpie wrap.
5421220	5424220	And James and Jovian is still not here?
5424220	5427220	Sharpie, you haven't shit in nine months.
5427220	5429220	You must feel great.
5429220	5430220	Yeah.
5430220	5431220	Yeah.
5431220	5432220	Yeah.
5432220	5433220	Yeah.
5433220	5434220	Really?
5434220	5435220	That's how we're ending the show?
5435220	5436220	Yeah.
5436220	5437220	Okay.
5437220	5438220	Yeah.
5438220	5439220	Yeah.
5439220	5440220	Yeah.
5440220	5442220	The keys of Portland.
5442220	5444220	What?
5444220	5447220	All right.
5447220	5458220	What's your name, young lady?
5458220	5459220	Kimberly.
5459220	5460220	Kimberly?
5460220	5461220	Kimberly.
5461220	5463220	What's your name?
5463220	5464220	Devon.
5464220	5465220	Devon.
5465220	5468220	I don't know what to do with that information.
5469220	5470220	All right.
5470220	5471220	Tell a story, Dan.
5471220	5473220	Dan, you've got no show anymore.
5473220	5475220	You have to create something new for us now.
5475220	5476220	Okay.
5476220	5477220	All right.
5477220	5479220	What would Sharpie do in Portland?
5479220	5480220	Yo.

5553220	5554220	Now.
5555220	5558600	Thank you guys so much.
5558600	5559680	You waited in line.
5559680	5561420	How much did you pay?
5561420	5563540	What were the tickets?
5563540	5564540	How much?
5564540	5565540	Twenty-five.
5565540	5566540	Twenty-five?
5566540	5567540	Yeah.
5567540	5569020	What car?
5569020	5571960	Twenty-five dollars.
5571960	5574920	Financial Colors.
5574920	5577620	Wrapped around Harman town.
5577620	5582100	Where P. is yellow and poop is brown.
5582100	5584060	Portland Friends.
5585060	5588460	Have a means to an end.
5588460	5592220	You eat yogurt and then you do yoga.
5592220	5595220	In Portland in Harman town.
5595220	5598940	I fucked your mama so hard.
5598940	5602540	In your front and back yard.
5602540	5605620	In Harman town.
5605620	5608620	Where P. is yellow and poop is brown.
5608620	5610860	And Portland is the place to go.
5610860	5613020	And I fucked your mama so hard.
5613020	5615380	And I went below to the basement.
5615380	5620500	Fucked your dad and I didn't let him up in time.
5620500	5622200	Because I had no rhyme.
5622200	5624580	But your dad was into it.
5624580	5627980	And I fucked him in the eye and in his armpit.
5627980	5634220	And he found it therapeutic and got more work done.
5634220	5636740	Because he's...
5636740	5640260	Because your dad loves getting fucked.
5640260	5643260	And he said, what's up?
5643260	5647180	And I fucked everyone that gave her a T.
5647180	5649420	I'm sorry, don't lose your enthusiasm.
5649420	5651900	Oh my God, Portland is the best.
5651900	5653940	And I fucked your mama so hard.
5653940	5655380	She's got a treasure chest.
5655380	5660620	And I put her titties around my penis and cane.
5660620	5663140	I came in the Northwester.
5663140	5665780	I love Portland is the city.
5665780	5667700	I fucked your mama so hard.
5667700	5669180	I won't say titty.
5669260	5672540	I fucked your mama so hard that my fucking was shitty.
5672540	5675140	Because I choked.
5675140	5677580	I couldn't fuck your mama good enough.
5677580	5680820	Because your mama's from Portland.
5680820	5684500	And she deserves better than me.
5684500	5690860	And oh, your mama's better than me.
5690860	5693660	Don't ever think that your mama deserves
5693660	5695820	to be fucked by anybody.
5695820	5696660	Except your dad.
5699340	5702060	I don't know what my message is.
5702060	5703300	I just know you're a good city.
5703300	5705500	But if I just say that, it'll feel like pandering.
5705500	5707580	Thank you, everybody, for coming to Harvard Town.
5707580	5708380	We love you.
5711620	5713580	Erin McGathey, Spencer Crittenden.
5717060	5717540	Whoa.
5720420	5722900	Whoa.
5722900	5726380	Everybody, whoa.
5726380	5729020	I fucked your mama in Portland.
5729020	5729620	I'm sorry.
5729620	5734460	If that's misogynistic, your mama's totally capable.
5734460	5735300	The show's over.
5735300	5737620	She's more capable than anybody.
5737620	5740300	You're allowed to leave anytime you want.
5740300	5744900	Your mama has the right to identify as either gender both
5744900	5746140	or either.
5746140	5747540	Your fucking mom is a cashmaker.
5747540	5749500	Community was canceled, you guys.
5749500	5752820	Your fucking mom is like a bigger thing.
5752820	5755740	No more community.
5755740	5759860	But it doesn't matter at Harman Town.
5759860	5763260	My show got canceled last night.
5763260	5767860	But we could still win the fight because I'll just
5767860	5771620	do another show and it'll be all right.
5771620	5773540	Harman Town.
5773540	5776260	I love Portland's trees.
5776260	5779620	I love the sky and the little honeybees.
5779620	5784900	I love your yogurt and your kites and your ocean line.
5785020	5787300	Portland, whoa.
5787300	5789460	Everything's made of wood.
5789460	5790700	Everybody run for your lives.
5790700	5792420	Everyone in Portland is good.
5792420	5793220	Get out of here.
5793220	5796220	Except for the two aggressively gay guys
5796220	5799980	that picked a fight with being chef at Life of Riley
5799980	5802660	on 10th and Newcastle.

5846140	5849140	I'm too drunk to end the show.
