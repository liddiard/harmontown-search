0	10880	Welcome once again to the DoubleTree Sweetwater and Extended Stay Hotel here at the Hayward
10880	11880	Theatre.
11880	12880	Now it's Dynasty typewriter.
12880	25080	Once again, very happy to announce to all y'all that Harman Town is now in session.
25080	29480	Sorry for the late start, but let's make up for it with our Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.
29480	51000	Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, everybody say oh yeah, let's bring out the
51000	60200	Mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
60200	61200	Thank you.
61200	70960	Yo, yo, yo, yo, rapping perfunctorally, rapping is perfunctoral to me, rapping is just a thing
70960	76200	you see when you come out at the top of the show, it's like pee, it comes out of your
76200	85720	dick, then goes on the floor, and then you rap a lot more, and then you want to rap less,
85720	90840	you're a victim of your own rapping gimmick.
90840	99160	Just look at your phone and try to get through it, no one's forcing you to rap you know.
99160	102240	I'm not in charge of this, this is Zach in the booth, he's running this, I don't have
102240	103240	the button on this.
103240	114120	Oh I know, I'm just looking at my notes, listening to my inner monologue, no one's
114120	122680	forcing you to rap, you don't have to do it, I forgot my water, I'll be right back.
122680	132040	What are you afraid of, are you afraid to start the show by just looking at people and
132040	146240	being in the moment, and engaging, yes, my name is MC Fear, I don't want to be here,
146240	154680	the world's falling apart, all right, thank you, welcome, welcome to...
154680	170240	I should either commit to a rap at the top of the show or I should just say thank you
170240	175640	very much and proceed right now, yeah, I don't know what I'm doing, we're just our third
175640	180480	weekend back in our honeymoon with the live audience, so I don't know what I'm doing,
180480	183240	feeling it out, I don't know how to start a show.
183240	189680	We're trying to get the audio dialed in for the home listener and everything, yeah, yeah.
189680	194640	If anyone hears me talking, I think I've mentioned it before, I have a bad thing in my throat,
194640	197760	so if I sound weird, that's why.
197760	201440	Yeah, you're going to get vocal therapy surgery soon.
201440	206240	I am, I'm going to have a little surgery and take a little pop up off of my vocal fold,
206240	211680	and then I can't talk for two weeks, so it's not going to be exciting for my girlfriend.
211680	215440	But don't worry, I already got an app, I'm already working on replacing you.
215440	220360	See, Dan, as a good friend, Dan is already, I was thinking I'll get a little chalkboard
220360	224920	like Beethoven and write things down, and the doctor gave me a little button that I
224920	231560	can wear that says I'm going through, like, what's it saying, like, no talking, I can't
231560	238040	talk because I'm going through, like, something, and vocal rest, yes, and so Dan, because he's
238040	243280	a techno genius, instantly got to work to help his good friend out.
243280	248080	Hey, everybody, how are you doing tonight?
248080	251440	You can put other phrases in there.
251440	256440	Yeah, we're talking about maybe, like, some fan out there, something that could just make
256440	260920	me like a big file of MP3s of some of my favorite phrases, and I could just come out here and
260920	266040	just DJ my own inimical sense of wits and wisdom.
266040	268800	We already knew we had to put this one in here.
268800	275320	Oh, it's 9-11.
275320	277700	Do I have to be British?
277700	279880	And then, of course, my favorite.
279880	283000	Dan, that sounds like you should do a rap.
283000	285800	You guys can't really understand him.
285800	289360	He said, Dan, that sounds like you should do a rap.
289360	292800	How's your, how's work life going, Dan?
292800	295720	That's good, I'm just, I'm just writing, I'm just trying to get done with this thing and
295720	298840	I just want to kill myself.
298840	302000	But it's probably, it's probably for the best.
302000	306000	It keeps me out for the Twitter for the most part, and that's a mess, and I'm having a
306000	307160	good time at Rick and Morty.
307160	311600	We're back in the writer's room for this.
311600	315360	How far into the 70 episodes are you so far?
315360	323320	We're just brainstorming, you know, like stuff.
323320	324320	Let's see.
324320	326560	Well, here's from my notes.
326560	328760	So there's this, there's this button.
328760	332080	Did I, did we, did I talk about this last time?
332080	334080	I don't believe so.
334080	335760	How do you know?
335760	338760	Oh, because I said there's a button.
338760	339760	Okay.
339760	343320	I mean, it could be, I mean, and we talk about buttons all the time.
343320	344320	How do you know?
344320	347680	There's a crosswalk button, if I mentioned this crosswalk button.
347680	354120	When we were working at Rick and Morty in the old Burbank offices, and there was this,
354120	359440	there was this beeping sound that would happen all the time that I always thought was a frenetic
359440	367320	version of, a weirdly arrhythmic version of like some kind of like, you know, hearing
367320	373760	impaired or visually impaired, I guess, crosswalk audio, like, like sometimes they make old
373760	380920	cuckoo sounds, the crosswalks for the, for the folks that can't see the walking people
380920	382920	pictograms.
383240	388680	And so the light will go like cuckoo, cuckoo, which means I guess walk.
388680	390960	They better tell them that.
390960	393080	I'm sure there's something.
393080	394520	Someone must coordinate with them.
394520	399600	But I always thought maybe there's some version of that because we're just hear this like.
399600	401600	Beep, beep, beep.
401600	403360	Beep, beep, beep.
403360	406240	Just coming out from this, this window.
406240	412080	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
412080	415160	And I think at one time I was like, what is that?
415160	416400	And someone's like, that's the crosswalk.
416400	418200	And I was like, okay, that confirms that.
418200	420120	See, then the months go by and I'm like,
420120	420960	no, what is that?
420960	421800	Is it the crosswalk?
421800	422880	What do you mean it's the crosswalk?
422880	423720	Like, it's crazy.
423720	427720	And one day I go down there and I'm gonna go
427720	429560	across the street to the liquor store
429560	434400	and I hit the button for the crosswalk and it goes beep.
434400	436680	And I go, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
436680	439240	Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
439240	441320	I'm like, that's what people are doing?
441960	442800	Wow.
445200	447400	And then sure enough, you go out, look out the window
447400	449480	and everybody's like beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
449480	451560	beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
451560	455160	beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
455160	457160	I have so many questions for this person.
457160	462000	Like, so do you, so you live in a society
462000	464920	where you are fine with the fact that this button
464920	468720	really just doesn't work, but you are not quite
468720	470640	to the point where you're gonna be Han Solo
470800	472440	and just bound across the street?
472440	474400	Like, because fuck that button.
474400	477160	Like, you're like, well, the button doesn't work
477160	480160	and that's fucked up, but I'm gonna press it a million times.
480160	483000	Like, oh, it didn't work again, it didn't work again,
483000	483840	it didn't work again.
483840	487200	Like, you think the button's supposed to work instantly?
487200	491360	Or is it that you think it's like a slot machine
491360	493280	kind of game where there's like a window
493280	495120	where you snooze, you lose.
495120	497560	Like, I checked back in with the button
497560	499640	and you were touching your purse.
499640	500920	Fuck you, lady.
500920	504160	And so you're just like, I don't know when you decide.
504160	505600	I know someone engineered this thing
505600	508360	to give me the feedback of, yes, the button's been pushed
508360	510400	because obviously some engineer for the city
510400	512960	like came back and got, guys, I know this is hard to believe
512960	516680	but people are pushing this thing 8,000 times a minute.
516680	517520	Are you sure?
517520	519440	It's not like kids just making like little EDM
519440	521520	like having fun making music while they wait.
521520	524320	I work above this thing for years.
524320	526360	And I'm telling, no, it's every human being
526360	530720	that goes to that crosswalk, just like old, young,
530720	533520	like whatever, like they're just like, baby, baby, baby.
533520	535360	It's like this weird like-
535360	536200	Maybe it's like Jeopardy,
536200	537800	like the person across the street hit it first
537800	538640	and then you're locked out
538640	540320	and you gotta hit the button a bunch of times.
540320	541160	Yeah.
541160	542320	That's it, that's-
542320	543160	I just-
543160	546560	That's the hardcore game show knowledge.
546560	549800	If you hit the Jeopardy buzzer
549800	551040	before the little light goes on,
551040	552920	it says you can now answer the question.
552920	554000	That's why you see people hitting the button
554000	554840	like a thousand times
554920	556320	because they don't-
556320	558800	If I thought that that's how the button worked,
558800	560200	that I would not push it.
560200	562120	I would go, I would push it once and I would go,
562120	563560	well, if it's gonna be like that, fuck it.
563560	564680	And I'd walk across the street.
564680	565960	And if the cop was like,
565960	568000	woo woo, you're jaywalking,
568000	570960	I'd be like, you better prove to me that that button works.
570960	573400	Show me how it works.
573400	575800	And then they'd be like, and then that would resolve it.
575800	577960	Or I get to go across the street anytime I want
577960	578800	until that happens.
578800	580680	Wait, do the siren a few times?
580680	585000	Woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, woo woo, woo woo.
585000	585840	It's just kind of crazy.
585840	587560	I'm trying to layer some sweet tracks
587560	590560	so we can have a full song at the end of the show.
590560	591920	All right, well, that was that thought.
591920	594880	I guess that kind of shit the bed.
594880	595720	Wait, there was one-
595720	596560	There's no pressure on you.
596560	597400	I forget where we were.
597400	598680	You don't have to enjoy my thoughts.
598680	601320	We were like in Kansas City or St. Louis or somewhere.
601320	604920	And sometimes a gentle voice goes, walk.
606360	607720	Walk, and then that lets you know.
607720	608560	Yeah.
608560	610120	But there's one that goes, stop.
611400	614600	If you hit the button and it's not time for you to go,
614600	616480	it's like, well, stop.
616480	617560	The thing actually yells at you.
617560	620280	It's like, don't, don't, no, stop.
620280	621920	But then like, I mean, don't try to walk.
621920	623040	No, I think they're telling you don't.
623040	624440	Well, yeah, they're telling you don't walk.
624440	625800	Yeah, but I think it doubles as-
625800	626640	Don't start walking.
626640	629440	Yeah, also stop fucking pushing the button.
629440	630320	Oh, well, I don't.
630320	632480	Oh, you're saying we should add that.
632480	633680	They should go, yeah.
633680	635560	They should add a sound that says,
635560	637280	hey, the button's been pushed.
638280	641760	You're good until an entire cycle of getting what you want
641760	643800	either happens or doesn't happen.
643800	647920	You definitely only have, think of it like an elevator.
649280	650600	An elevator.
650600	651760	I'm like a six year old kid.
651760	653280	Think about it like spaghetti.
654840	655680	Biscuetti.
656680	657840	Think about it like an elevator.
657840	659200	I was gonna say you fucking moron,
659200	662400	and then I found out I can't say the word elevator.
662400	664320	You got 11 people waiting across the road,
664320	665640	and everyone's just standing there chilling.
665640	667000	Everyone's looking up their phones,
667920	669640	and everybody looks up,
669640	672280	either because you're being told to stop what you're doing,
672280	674400	or does someone trying to cross the street,
674400	675800	they're gonna get hit by a bus?
675800	676880	It's really alarming.
678000	680080	And you got those new buses that are silent.
680080	682200	There's like those completely electric silent buses.
682200	684360	They're just, they're gonna kill everybody.
685560	688320	The whole point of a bus is that you can hear it coming.
688320	690320	That's the whole point of a bus.
691920	692760	Yeah.
697000	702000	The fact that somebody was smart enough to say,
702480	704880	let's put some seats in this and make some money.
713880	714960	You know, people ask me,
714960	719880	Dan, you're kind of a social media master.
719880	724880	Like, I'm looking to spread my influence,
725400	728720	boost my signal, like, how do I get more followers?
728720	731400	How do I get my, I wanna be able to use
731400	736400	these social medias to make a difference in the world,
736440	741040	and I don't have the reach that you or Joel McHale have.
741040	746040	I didn't accidentally get born right around the time
747200	749360	that would make me 30 when Twitter was invented,
749360	753200	so now I got a fucked up username that's 20 numbers long,
753200	756240	and I got two followers, and I don't know what to do.
756240	759240	And I say, here's, look, here's what you do.
759240	763240	You just, like, go onto Twitter,
763240	767280	and you look for the things that are getting retweeted
767280	769000	by the thousands.
769000	770520	Oh, that got a lot of retweets, look at that.
770520	771840	People really liked reading that,
771840	773640	and then they clicked retweet after they saw that.
773640	776280	And then you click reply to those,
776280	780360	and then you just argue with another person
780360	782040	who has two followers.
782040	784800	If you do that for eight years,
784800	787800	I promise you, you will gain five followers,
789040	791960	because you're performing for an audience of two,
791960	795120	and you're a fucking idiot.
795120	799800	Anyways, I don't understand, it's like somebody would go,
799800	802600	hey, I don't understand, why are they taking babies?
802600	805120	That seems bad, and it's like 10,000 retweets.
805120	807320	You know what, that person's job is kinda done,
807320	809400	like, they're not really a dragon for you to slay,
809400	811320	and then I just look at the responses,
811760	813760	people are like, yeah, but what do you think
813760	815480	about the ramifications of the,
815480	818440	why don't you just fucking tweet it on your own thing,
818440	821920	because then eight people, who do you think is reading this?
821920	824040	You weirdo, why are you arguing?
824040	826280	What are you climbing this person's wall,
826280	829040	and going like, yeah, I have a thing to say about that?
829040	833600	It just seems kinda weird, you always look at the,
833600	836360	look at the number of retweets and likes, that's it.
836360	837200	Whoa!
843000	843840	Oh!
852080	853920	Eventually, I would bring you out.
857920	860840	Get used to it, get used to it.
862920	864120	No, he's blowing it up.
865120	869120	Get used to it, get used to it, get used to it.
874280	879280	It gets worse, the closer you get, it gets worse.
880280	885280	The closer you are, worse, the closer you get, it gets worse.
885480	887240	Rob Schon, everyone.
888240	889720	The closer you are.
889720	890880	He's rolling a chair.
894120	899120	He's moving the stage.
906400	908520	The cord is tangled in a chair.
909960	911200	He threw the chair.
914080	915320	He's sitting down.
917040	919080	We had such a good show last week.
919080	920640	Feel the lens.
920640	922560	Oh, get, feel the lens?
922560	924080	Yeah, no, give him a light lens.
924120	927000	That show was great, you were talking to Judd Apatow.
927000	929800	Yeah, nobody was, nobody was playing
929800	933120	cool monster chair games. Hello, Dan.
933120	937320	I haven't, I haven't seen you in a while now.
937320	939360	Yeah, I, you know.
939360	940200	You're looking good.
940200	942000	Oh, wait, that's, so that's gonna feed back, right?
942000	943760	If I bring the microphone over here, isn't that?
943760	944600	The mic.
945640	947440	Just don't point the mic at the thing.
947440	948280	Like this.
949120	949960	Don't shout.
951400	952920	I won't, I won't.
952920	953760	Thank you for not.
954360	955720	I'm gonna get some kinks to work out.
959160	960960	That was a great thing to happen after you said
960960	962560	we have some kinks to work out.
964440	969440	Oh boy, you know, seven up, seven ups really gotta start
970800	971960	bringing their A game.
971960	974720	I think, I mean, I think Sprite is winning
974720	976600	this white soda war.
981000	982840	You mean remember, remember?
982880	987800	The Uncola, they used to own the fucking airwaves, man.
987800	990480	Now I go into a restaurant, you know?
990480	994200	I said like seven up, but they say, Sprite okay.
994200	997520	I mean, like, when's the last time you had seven up?
997520	998680	I mean, be serious.
998680	1001560	When's the last time anybody had seven up
1001560	1004200	at a place of business?
1007800	1008640	You know?
1009640	1013360	They really, I mean, they just, they backed off.
1013360	1014840	It's tortoise in the hair.
1014840	1017840	You know, they were just like, what are they gonna do?
1017840	1019640	Okay, Slice.
1019640	1021200	All right.
1021200	1022400	Yeah.
1022400	1024720	You're gonna try to take us down.
1024720	1027240	You're gonna try to take down the Uncola.
1027240	1028480	We got the dot.
1028480	1031600	We got the red dot with the sunglasses, man.
1031600	1033040	You're gonna try to take us down.
1033040	1034560	Okay, fine, whatever.
1034560	1037320	And they're hanging out and Sprite just is like
1037320	1040040	slow and steady wins the race, man.
1040040	1042320	And they fucking, they took it over.
1042320	1044320	They took it over.
1044320	1046120	It's gone.
1046120	1048320	It's all over with, man.
1048320	1049560	What are they doing?
1049560	1051800	What are you fucking doing, seven up?
1051800	1053440	Get in the game.
1053440	1056200	Fucking start ideas.
1056200	1057840	Give me ideas, seven up.
1057840	1061360	We went up into your campaign.
1061360	1065280	What, I mean, Jesus fucking Christ.
1067520	1070440	Don't you, I mean, like really?
1070440	1073680	I mean, God damn it.
1073680	1078680	I mean, I'm not alone here with this, right?
1079760	1080760	No, right?
1080760	1083440	Because I used to be a big bubble up guy.
1083440	1084600	See, yeah.
1084600	1085680	And where are they?
1085680	1087160	You don't hear them anymore.
1087160	1090200	Seven up is going bubble up pretty soon, man.
1094320	1096920	Is that the name of also a Sprite alternative?
1097520	1100400	Yeah, from 1948, I think.
1100400	1103200	There's a song with bubble up in it.
1103200	1106160	Rainbow stew and a silver spoon.
1106160	1107920	I think what you're saying is seven up
1107920	1109920	used to be, used to own the market
1109920	1114040	because they were the un-cola alternative.
1114040	1116280	Right, the un-cola.
1116280	1118560	Crispin clean, no caffeine, right?
1118560	1119400	Ah, ah, ah.
1119400	1120240	Yeah.
1121400	1124520	They had the steel vagina guy in the fucking commercial.
1124520	1127120	They had him locked.
1127120	1127960	Yep.
1127960	1131240	It's like Jim Ensign, he dies and now the company's done.
1133240	1135760	Yeah, there must've been some Steve Jobs of seven up.
1135760	1139240	I think they didn't Sprite get bought by Coca-Cola.
1140440	1142080	I don't know, I don't know.
1142080	1143760	Seems, I don't know.
1143760	1146520	Somebody, I mean, I just, you know,
1146520	1149680	I mean, like you kids know about seven up, right?
1149680	1151200	Anyone?
1151200	1152040	I mean, I don't know.
1152040	1153720	It could be something.
1153720	1155280	Something people don't know about.
1155280	1156800	Well, our first guest.
1156800	1158040	What about you, Spencer?
1158040	1158960	I'm not finished.
1163520	1165040	Spencer, what is your opinion?
1165040	1165880	Oh, have you?
1165880	1168920	Why do you have drawers in front of your desk?
1173920	1175560	I have to get a pencil.
1176480	1177320	Uh-oh.
1178160	1179000	Ugh!
1183000	1185800	I should've probably got a piece of paper first.
1189440	1191000	What's on the other side?
1193600	1196040	No, what's on, what's on, what's?
1196040	1197360	What?
1197360	1198200	Yes!
1198200	1200560	I'm not sure I understand why that does.
1200560	1202400	I want this to be like an advent calendar
1202400	1204560	for every show we open up a new thing.
1204560	1207360	Ah, so everybody listening, you know,
1207360	1209680	just like, not that I care about the free listeners.
1209680	1213400	I mean, like, I like the subscribers more,
1213400	1215440	but even they sometimes listen to audio only,
1215440	1216800	but I'm saying, like, it's, you know,
1216800	1220040	last week, fucking Apatow killed it.
1220040	1223080	Like, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
1223080	1225960	great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great,
1226680	1228080	I haven't listened to it.
1230080	1233120	How unattractive is the actual desk side?
1233120	1235440	That is the desk side.
1235440	1238000	I gotta tell you, it's not great back here.
1238000	1241160	This is the side you want to be looking at.
1241160	1244960	It's all this shitty, like, raw plywood in the back.
1244960	1247520	Yeah, it's designed to go up against a wall.
1249520	1252720	It's not like a command center.
1253520	1256680	It's not like a command desk.
1258040	1259320	Are you okay, by the way?
1259320	1261680	Like, your Instagrams are starting to look photoshopped.
1261680	1263440	Oh, yeah, people were saying that.
1263440	1266720	It was, that's, you know, that was those MySpace angles.
1266720	1268760	It turns out, you know, you can take pictures
1268760	1270760	from flattering angles.
1270760	1271920	Holy shit.
1273640	1275840	You look like a goddamn pirate.
1275840	1277600	I know, it's amazing.
1277600	1279520	I was upset.
1279520	1280760	I mean, happy.
1280760	1282480	No, but you look,
1282520	1283360	you look hot.
1283360	1284280	You look hot in it.
1284280	1285160	I'm getting there.
1285160	1286000	Yeah.
1287880	1289200	Let's bring out an old friend of the show.
1289200	1290480	Boston's coming up.
1290480	1292240	We got that show.
1292240	1293560	Let's come on.
1293560	1294400	What?
1294400	1296360	You made me sit out there waiting.
1296360	1298640	I had to come in here with a fucking balloon.
1299760	1301080	With a fucking balloon.
1301080	1302240	You didn't have to.
1304440	1307360	I don't understand why I have to wait 15 minutes
1307360	1310360	before you could bring me out like a fucking,
1310360	1311200	what the heck?
1311200	1313320	Am I pedaling or something like that?
1313320	1314520	I can't come out.
1314520	1316360	I'm a second class citizen.
1316360	1317920	I gotta roll in here.
1317920	1319880	I guess we'll bring Rob out.
1321360	1324400	I have no idea if you're ever gonna bring me out there.
1324400	1325640	I have to come in.
1325640	1327680	Wait, you have, you have no idea?
1327680	1328520	Yeah, how would you?
1328520	1329400	I have no idea.
1329400	1330360	You have no idea.
1330360	1331880	I have no idea.
1331880	1332880	That's fair, okay.
1333720	1335400	I have no idea if I'm ever gonna.
1337200	1338800	James Adomian, everybody.
1338800	1340760	James Adomian.
1340760	1343120	Let's bring James Adomian out.
1343120	1343960	Oh, yeah.
1347320	1349720	It's been a long day
1349720	1353000	and I've been taking the wrong way.
1353000	1355640	I can't tell if you should be.
1355640	1357160	I was the first guest, right?
1357160	1358000	Yes.
1358000	1361000	I was hoping I didn't just accidentally steal someone's spot.
1361000	1362520	No, it's not, I mean, don't even,
1362520	1363560	I'm not a guest.
1363560	1368560	I'm a fucking part of the show that comes out later.
1368680	1370240	When we get to it.
1370240	1371520	He's a phenomenon.
1374240	1376360	You could tell, you could even hear me trying to,
1376360	1377760	I was trying to get you out here.
1377760	1379360	Oh, yeah, no, I was, I'm fine.
1379360	1380600	This guy's a friend of the show.
1380600	1381440	There's drinks back there.
1381440	1384440	I've known you since you were 19 years old.
1384440	1385960	I'm a friend of the show.
1387680	1389480	I love that shows have friends.
1390520	1394040	I love that a show like takes a friend out to the lake
1394040	1395920	and like talks serious stuff.
1395920	1398120	Yeah, and maybe that, maybe that friend
1398560	1400120	sometimes needs to go all the way out on the lake
1400120	1402120	and then there's a single gunshot.
1404480	1407480	He was a friend of the show, let's keep it at that.
1407480	1409040	I know it was you, Kumail.
1412400	1414240	He'll be back, he'll be back.
1414240	1415280	We did not kill him.
1415280	1416120	No, we won't.
1417520	1420040	Yeah, how are you, James, a Domian?
1420040	1421880	I'm great, I'm fantastic.
1421880	1423800	All my projects have been canceled,
1423800	1425160	so I have nothing to plug.
1425640	1429280	I'm free, I'm liberated, thank you.
1429280	1430440	He knows Gorka.
1430440	1433240	I was actually watching, sometimes I'll always get
1433240	1435800	like Harman Town highlights suggested
1435800	1438240	in the YouTube margins.
1438240	1441080	Wait, you get yourself marketed to you?
1441080	1444240	Yeah, and I swear, I don't know, I mean,
1444240	1445560	I don't know what the algorithm is
1445560	1447360	because I hate myself, that's probably it.
1447360	1449000	Like I'm sure I click on shit that says
1449000	1451560	like I'm an asshole or something, but it's just like,
1452000	1452840	anyways, but.
1452840	1455480	That's like the Emperor in Star Wars
1455480	1457600	like jolting himself with his powers.
1457600	1458840	But it's actually a really nice thing
1458840	1460800	because it's been almost 300 episodes
1460800	1463720	and there is, you're self loathing, you tend to just go,
1463720	1464960	oh, everything's always been shit
1464960	1466080	and then there's like people out there
1466080	1468320	that'll pull like little clips and they'll go,
1468320	1470760	this is an amazing moment and they'll give it a nice title
1470760	1473000	and you go, yes, I will click on the first time
1473000	1475960	James and Domian did Bernie Sanders coming out of the show.
1475960	1476800	And it was here.
1476800	1479760	You debuted, you debuted your Sanders impression.
1479760	1484760	Bernie Sanders debuted on Harmontown at the meltdown.
1485080	1486080	And he was.
1486080	1487520	I like just that as a pull quote.
1487520	1490160	Bernie Sanders debuted on Harmontown.
1491840	1494760	And the political scene, the mess that at the stage
1494760	1498400	that became coated in blood was so clean back then
1498400	1500240	that you could see me not knowing.
1500240	1502920	I had asked Demorge Brown, who's Bernie Sanders?
1502920	1507040	And he said, oh, it's that black guy that is Ben Carson.
1507040	1508280	I was like, oh, it's Ben Carson.
1508280	1510240	So I'm introducing who I think is Ben Carson.
1510240	1511560	I don't know either of their names.
1511560	1514080	And then you come out and these wigs and.
1514080	1516600	Yes, there were two wigs on the side of my head.
1516600	1519840	These two really awful wigs like Bobby pin together
1519840	1521880	and on both on backwards.
1521880	1522720	It was very good.
1522720	1525760	Yeah, yeah, that's how you, that's DIY.
1525760	1530240	What was the ride like you had a homespun version of like,
1530240	1533080	I know always like, oh, there'll always be that feature
1533080	1535400	in variety or something about like,
1535400	1537520	oh, this guy got cast on SNL
1537600	1540120	and who little did he know that Gary Hart
1540120	1541520	would become such a thing
1541520	1543680	because that was one of his impressions.
1543680	1545680	But you just did it like.
1548040	1548880	Yeah, there's no danger.
1548880	1551160	The weekend style, like mixtape style
1551160	1552680	like turned platinum artists.
1552680	1555640	Like you're Bernie Sanders became like a cottage industry
1555640	1558120	that you controlled and.
1558120	1561440	Yes, and look, as all industries,
1561440	1564040	I believe that the Bernie Sanders industry
1564040	1565920	should be strictly regulated.
1565920	1570920	There should be no monopolies
1571240	1573560	and the workers should take control
1573560	1575000	of the impression itself.
1579360	1580200	We're there.
1581120	1582320	Are there any little tidbits
1582320	1583640	or are you tired of talking about it?
1583640	1587040	Like, like, like the ride of like, holy shit,
1587040	1589720	you started, you got it in the ground floor
1589720	1591680	of this impression of this guy
1591680	1595120	that has become like the Tony Stark
1595120	1597760	of this Marvel movie that's lasting four years.
1597760	1599520	It changed rapidly week to week.
1599520	1600520	When I started doing it,
1600520	1602640	I knew and loved Bernie Sanders,
1602640	1604880	but I thought I was doing an impression
1604880	1606360	of someone who was doomed,
1606360	1608840	like Dennis Kucinich.
1608840	1612200	So my angle was, well, I don't have a chance.
1612200	1615360	Within a week, there were these 30,000 people crowds
1615360	1618200	and I was like, that's not the angle anymore.
1619920	1621080	When I first started doing it,
1621080	1623160	it was like, this is the biggest crowd I've seen.
1623160	1624360	Ha, ha, ha, big laugh.
1624360	1625680	But after a while, it was like,
1625680	1627920	I can't believe I'm playing a room this small.
1627920	1631360	Which must parallel his journey, I assume,
1631360	1632360	if he were up here.
1632360	1635680	Yeah, I think he definitely started in a Volvo somewhere.
1638240	1640120	Whenever I see a good Volvo
1640120	1642520	or an old Studebaker on the road,
1642520	1644240	I'm like, that's Bernie Sanders' car.
1644240	1647120	But was there any moment that really like,
1648880	1651680	just the absurdity reached a height for you where,
1651680	1654520	because the political fervor of all of this
1654520	1656360	and the fact that you're out there doing a guy,
1656360	1657840	was there anybody like,
1657840	1659280	I don't know what I'm expecting to hear,
1659280	1661840	like someone yelling, hey, James,
1661840	1663840	and then like throwing paint on you
1663840	1665560	and going like, stop making fun of him.
1665560	1667560	You're part of the problem or the opposite.
1667560	1672400	Like there was a couple of broken brains
1672400	1675560	that thought that making fun of Bernie Sanders
1675560	1677760	is like not allowed, because he's perfect.
1677760	1679000	And I'm like, no, I like him.
1679680	1682520	I'm echo, I am a second Bernie Sanders.
1683440	1685400	I'm trying to say the same things
1685400	1686800	and get the message amplified
1686800	1688840	and also work in some more radical things.
1688840	1690480	Like I got to call for the legalization
1690480	1692720	of psilocybin mushrooms, which he wouldn't do,
1692720	1694280	but I was like, I'm gonna do it.
1695480	1697360	Because I write a piece in New Yorker
1697360	1698760	that said that your impression of him
1698760	1701160	might've cost him two and a half points in the primary.
1701160	1702480	Thank you.
1702480	1704800	Was that an article or was that like
1704800	1706840	a two person New Yorker cartoon
1707840	1711280	where there was like an ill shaping therapist
1711280	1714160	talking to a desk with George Bush.
1714160	1716360	And it was actually, it was my winning caption.
1716360	1717800	That wasn't even one that had.
1717800	1718640	It's a contest.
1720360	1725160	But sometimes people thought from our advertising
1725160	1727520	that it was really gonna be a Trump versus Bernie debate
1727520	1729880	when we were on the road, me and Anthony and Taminik.
1729880	1733360	And in Boston, there was a big sign on the front door
1733360	1736200	that was like, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders
1736200	1737840	will not be at the show tonight.
1737840	1739040	These are comedians.
1739040	1740080	Jesus.
1740080	1742600	Because they had been getting calls, apparently.
1743440	1747200	Speaking of, yeah, Anthony's Trump impression fantastic
1747200	1750080	and was like, but everybody's like,
1750080	1751640	I mean, that's a guy that's like,
1751640	1754120	everybody's got a Trump impression.
1754120	1755640	Who is a Trump impression?
1755640	1756480	Have you dabbled?
1756480	1761160	Like you're, you know, on the road I do a Trump impression
1761160	1762880	because I feel like I have to.
1762880	1765000	Cause I went to, I was in Europe
1765000	1767360	and I'm like the American who does impressions.
1767360	1769520	And if like, if you don't do a Trump impression,
1769520	1771080	there's like, you failed, mate.
1772760	1774320	It seems like kind of a hard impression.
1774320	1776400	Like there's a surface that's just like Bay's,
1776400	1777840	like George Bush, Nat Gandy.
1777840	1778760	Like you just got like that.
1778760	1780360	Like the Trump version of that would be like,
1780360	1782120	I'm Donald Trump.
1782120	1782960	I don't know.
1782960	1783800	I tried it.
1784840	1786160	There's a stuntedness to the book.
1786160	1787080	But he has like a tool.
1787080	1790960	He has like a weird jagged toolbox of like.
1790960	1792760	Anthony Taminik is my favorite.
1793360	1795760	He does the breathy thing, you know,
1795760	1797240	where it's just, I mean, come on.
1797240	1801760	And I mostly just ape his impression
1801760	1804000	and give him credit one fourth of the time.
1804000	1809000	But there's something, I love that Donald Trump speaks.
1809160	1811800	Like he hates people from other cultures
1811800	1815800	and places and races, but he speaks English
1815800	1819320	in a way that would be useful if you were learning English
1819320	1820360	for the first time.
1821360	1823800	Or if you're teaching it to someone.
1823800	1827120	Cause he uses very simple sentences and easy words.
1827120	1828560	He's like, we used to be bad.
1828560	1830600	We were so bad in the past.
1830600	1832800	We used to be bad.
1832800	1835760	Now here in the present, we're getting better.
1835760	1837960	We're so much getting better.
1837960	1840360	And in the future, we're going to be great.
1840360	1841760	We're going to be great.
1841760	1843760	That's all three possibilities.
1846160	1847240	He's conjugating.
1847240	1850920	George Carlin's set too, like Rick Moran's impression
1850920	1851760	of George Carlin.
1851760	1855160	It's like, beets, beets, you want beets?
1855160	1856320	Am I on the plane?
1856320	1858400	Why are you on the plane?
1858400	1860600	I'm not on the plane, the plane is grounded.
1860600	1862280	It's a low energy plane.
1863720	1865920	You got more, you want more stuff.
1865920	1868280	You got to have stuff to put your stuff in.
1868280	1869640	Well, now you got to have stuff and put,
1869640	1873200	I'm trying to do George Carlin's material as Donald Trump
1873200	1874040	in case that's not clear.
1874040	1874880	That's what I was trying to do too,
1874880	1875840	with you on the plane.
1876080	1878800	You did it, and then I tried to come in and join the party
1878800	1879760	and I killed it.
1882160	1883200	You have owners.
1883200	1885200	You think you're free, you have owners.
1885200	1887400	I mean, come on, I'm your owner.
1888520	1891040	All right, that was a George Carlin pin, thank you.
1891040	1892520	We're going to make a cage.
1892520	1894480	It's going to hold so many babies.
1894480	1897080	So many children are going to fit in so many cages.
1899080	1901360	I like to think of them as hard cradles.
1901360	1902480	They're hard cradles.
1902480	1906400	Think of them as big boy pins.
1908200	1909360	Big boy cribs.
1909360	1910200	What was that?
1910200	1913280	I want to check in with Spencer for some Spencer.
1913280	1916440	It's a new segment called Spencer Spleenies.
1916440	1917280	Yeah.
1917280	1920800	Spencer Spleenies, oh, sorry.
1920800	1922560	I was just so excited, sorry.
1922560	1923400	Oh, okay.
1924680	1925520	Okay.
1926680	1927520	It's a weird theme.
1927520	1929560	A lot happened at once.
1929560	1930400	Well, I wanted to check,
1930440	1931560	because I clicked on the thing
1931560	1934320	where the White House lady was going,
1934320	1936720	where it was like, hey, this is misinformation.
1936720	1939640	And then she's like, I watched like four minutes of it,
1939640	1942280	where she's like, this is the reality of it
1942280	1943120	and all this stuff.
1943120	1945760	For these people, as we're all tweeting
1945760	1948240	and being alarmed and going like,
1948240	1951920	boy, does this feel a lot like something
1951920	1953920	from history books and things and all this stuff.
1953920	1957400	And then there's one chorus of counter argument,
1957400	1960840	which is this, it happened under Obama too.
1960840	1964800	And it's like such a scattering of like signals.
1964800	1966720	And I just don't know if you've parsed any of it.
1966720	1968280	Well, a good rule of thumb
1968280	1971080	is everything Republicans say is a lie.
1971080	1973600	So if you start from there.
1973600	1977400	No, but specifically, I understand that.
1977400	1979400	Well, my understanding is that policy
1979400	1982600	that everyone's pointing to in bad faith to lie to people
1982600	1986860	is that unaccompanied minors found at the border
1986860	1990540	without parents were detained.
1990540	1992340	So that's not good.
1992340	1995460	But I mean, you either leave a kid in the desert
1995460	1996940	or you don't leave a kid.
1996940	1998900	So I mean, it's not a comparison.
1998900	2000620	Also, Obama wasn't great.
2000620	2002920	He was the before Trump, a real deporter guy,
2002920	2004900	but he got him out of the country.
2004900	2008060	He didn't keep them in concentration camps.
2008060	2011140	So it's hard to really compare the two.
2011140	2013540	The thing is, politicians are bad
2013540	2015060	even when they're not as bad.
2015060	2018580	So Obama is bad even when he's the best president I know.
2019580	2020620	But he was, yeah.
2020620	2022940	So does that answer your question or am I okay?
2022940	2023780	Dan, hang on.
2023780	2024860	If you're going to ask him another question,
2024860	2027620	I want to take another pass at a thing.
2027620	2028460	Thank God.
2028460	2029780	Well, yeah.
2029780	2031900	I think you owe us another first.
2031900	2032740	Yeah.
2032740	2034180	Okay, so go ahead.
2034180	2035540	First tee up the segments
2035540	2037220	and then we cut to the graphic, you know,
2037220	2038060	and the whole thing.
2038060	2039420	All right.
2039420	2040860	I haven't played this song in a long time,
2040860	2042580	so I'm not sure it's perfect, but we'll.
2042580	2044420	Well, there's a lot of stuff going on in the news
2044420	2047220	and I can't tell my ass from a hole in the ground
2047220	2051300	and I'm too selfish and rich to really care that much.
2051300	2052900	That's when I turned to my friend, Spencer,
2052900	2054660	for Spencer Spleenies.
2061100	2063540	Last time on Spencer Spleenies.
2065220	2066060	I don't know.
2067860	2069620	Do you have the code, Senator?
2070940	2072020	This isn't ketchup.
2074420	2075980	People are dying.
2077060	2078580	No, actually, that is ketchup.
2080620	2081820	You bread raptors.
2085860	2088380	Wow, it seems like we missed an episode.
2092740	2097020	Yeah, I think most programs that are evil
2097020	2100380	originated in some version that people didn't realize
2100380	2102020	were going to be so evil at first.
2102900	2107900	But Obama did not have a clean immigration policy.
2107900	2108980	It was bad.
2108980	2110260	And there were people at the time saying,
2110260	2112900	hey, eventually someone's gonna get a hold of this power
2112900	2114340	and abuse it.
2114340	2117020	Conversely, Obama got blamed completely
2117020	2119780	for the drone killings, which were very bad,
2119780	2122660	but Bush started it.
2122660	2123580	It started under Bush.
2123580	2124980	So it's like, if it's really bad,
2124980	2127140	it's often rooted in the last guy too.
2127140	2129860	Yeah, I guess we're just paying the price
2129860	2133580	for a fucking 100 years of just going,
2133580	2135900	eh, politicians, be in the price.
2138540	2140380	But do we really have to, man, I was born.
2140380	2143220	We never should have got those guys off those soap boxes.
2144540	2145940	Things would have been a lot better.
2145940	2147540	We could just throw a tomato at them
2147540	2148780	if they hit his leg and they were like,
2148780	2152020	hey, have you seen my baby?
2152020	2153460	Have you seen my baby?
2153460	2154300	Stop, step.
2154300	2156020	Get off the rocker.
2156020	2158340	And also, the politicians can't be picking our pockets
2158340	2159980	when they get their thumbs up on their suspenders,
2159980	2162300	like this, where we can see their hands.
2162300	2163500	That was why they did that.
2163500	2168500	Whatever happened to a good old whistle stock tour?
2169780	2171100	Nothing right here.
2173180	2174020	But the fact is-
2174020	2177020	Teddy Roosevelt was the most attractive fat man.
2178500	2179940	I can imagine.
2179940	2181700	He was like, robust.
2183540	2188100	But that memo that people are tweeting,
2188340	2190380	where it's like signed by Sessions
2190380	2195140	and it's like zero tolerance, like, here we go.
2195140	2196060	That's a real thing.
2196060	2199500	That's not like the libs going,
2199500	2201060	we're connecting these dots.
2201060	2204020	It's like, that's the key, right?
2204020	2206780	Is that they were like, oh, let's jack it up.
2206780	2207620	Like, where-
2207620	2209260	Yeah, no, that's a policy change.
2209260	2211300	Yeah, no, a very explicit policy change.
2211300	2214460	And as a result, whether they intended it or not,
2214460	2216540	there's like this wake of that motorboat
2216540	2218020	that's like a bunch of babies
2218020	2219260	being ripped from mother's arms.
2219260	2222020	And they're like either, what I can't tell is if,
2222020	2224740	because as if they were like, yeah,
2224740	2227140	there's going to be babies ripped from mother's arms,
2227140	2229460	but they're going to be a certain shade of brown baby
2229460	2231700	and brown arm, and there's going to be a certain number
2231700	2233100	and we're going to keep ratcheting it up.
2233100	2235260	Or like, the motorboat in the no wake zone
2235260	2238820	just going like, and pretty soon,
2238820	2241620	and it's all about that wall negotiation, right?
2242340	2247340	It's like, I think that they intend to cause misery
2248500	2252500	for non-white families, mostly at the border
2252500	2256180	and at other places where they detain immigrants.
2256180	2258140	And I think there's people that want there
2258140	2262260	to be family misery, to deter people from coming in,
2262260	2263460	which is a nightmare.
2263460	2265260	They say that out loud, they've said that.
2265260	2267180	I mean, before it became controversial
2267180	2268980	because we didn't have pictures, they were like,
2268980	2269900	yeah, it's going to be great.
2269900	2271180	We'll be separating families
2271180	2272940	and they'll be like, I don't want to separate my family.
2272940	2274100	I'm not going to come to America.
2274100	2275660	Like, that was what they were saying.
2275660	2276820	This is the plan.
2276820	2278420	But now that it's actually happening,
2278420	2279700	they're like, this isn't happening.
2279700	2283740	But, you know, before it was like a political issue,
2283740	2285580	you know, they were like, no, it'd be great.
2285580	2287260	We're going to separate families.
2287260	2288620	Like, and that was just, you know,
2288620	2289900	what they were openly saying.
2289900	2291620	You know how you compromised?
2291620	2292860	Wall of babies.
2296460	2297780	They're already there.
2298500	2300220	Two birds with one stone.
2300220	2301060	Yeah.
2302060	2303460	It's called compromised people.
2303460	2305300	Was it a wall of white babies?
2305300	2306100	Huh?
2306100	2307500	Like, that are facing out wearing it.
2307500	2309300	No, no, hey, Jan, take it easy.
2309300	2310140	I know, I want it.
2310140	2310980	Take it easy.
2311980	2314660	I think you wildly misread my points.
2315860	2319300	Now, this wall's going to be brown, brown, brown.
2319300	2321380	But is that, so that's like a very grizzly,
2321380	2323460	you're talking about like a Thunderdome thing
2323460	2326380	where the babies are like, like an example.
2326620	2329060	The picture of the cage that all these kids are in,
2329060	2331660	you're making a Thunderdome of people.
2331660	2335220	I thought maybe like healthy, white, well-fed,
2335220	2338940	fat white babies that are like facing Mexico.
2338940	2342940	And the sign says, look, we already have so many babies.
2343940	2347820	And then the babies are like, we love America.
2347820	2350340	Don't come in here with your baby.
2350340	2355820	I mean, I hear people say, oh, it's not helpful.
2355820	2357780	It's not helpful to say that they're Nazis.
2357780	2360420	And I hear that, I'm not sure where I stand on it,
2360420	2363100	but definitely if, okay, okay, fine, fine, fine.
2363100	2365500	For sake of argument, if they're not literally Nazis,
2365500	2368460	they're at least like the bad guys from children of men.
2370460	2373780	And I think like, we're our own bad thing.
2373780	2375620	We're our own bad thing and we've got to stop it.
2375620	2376460	Yeah, I know.
2377700	2380620	Here's the thing, I like to think,
2380620	2384540	like I think in my listenership, if that's a word,
2384540	2386220	there's probably everything but Nazis.
2386220	2387700	Maybe there's a couple, like there's probably a little
2387700	2390860	churn coming through, like, like, ooh, I thought I saw.
2390860	2393060	Gorka could be a secret Nazi.
2393060	2394900	I saw enough Rick and Morty to tune in.
2394900	2396260	What was this cuck talking about?
2396260	2398460	But like, I know, you could be a libertarian
2398460	2399300	and listen to the show.
2399300	2402300	You could be a fiscal log cabin Republican.
2402300	2403900	Like you're probably not gonna, you're gonna go,
2403900	2406020	oh, he's a big fat blowhard.
2406020	2407260	Like I resonate with him.
2407260	2410060	Like, you're welcome here.
2410060	2411020	I'm not gonna shame you.
2411020	2413420	Oh, the free markets.
2413420	2417620	As you probably know, like I was the most apolitical,
2417620	2419300	like kind of like guy.
2419300	2422100	Like I was like, oh, I don't believe in politics.
2422100	2423260	I don't believe in the election.
2423260	2424780	And then it was like, the election happened.
2424780	2426220	And then it became fucking shrub.
2426220	2427220	I fucking hate shrub.
2427220	2428420	I hate him so much.
2429420	2430660	Fucking hate him.
2431740	2433580	You know, sort of one, I just like,
2433580	2434500	what do you want to talk about?
2434500	2436380	Farts for an hour?
2436380	2438620	It's just you, it's all, it's just you.
2438620	2441900	I was trying to connect with you with the seven up thing.
2441900	2445700	Yeah, you're not giving shrub enough credit
2445700	2448060	for trying to connect with you earlier.
2448060	2449460	I don't suffer the illusion.
2449460	2450700	I never see you anymore.
2450700	2451540	I never see you anymore.
2451540	2453540	I just want to have a conversation with my friends
2453540	2455940	about what's going on in my world,
2455940	2458300	which includes what's going on in other people's world.
2458300	2460180	Yeah, no one's stopping you.
2460180	2461460	Yeah, you're not stopping me.
2461460	2464020	You look like a fucking like dead scarecrow over there.
2464020	2466820	He's swiveling around in your chairs, rolling his eyes.
2466820	2468700	And he's like, he's like mounting a thing.
2468700	2470300	It's like, you think I don't know what's going on?
2470300	2472140	You got, you got shrub loyalists,
2472140	2474220	like, like, like building in my crowd.
2475380	2476220	I know what's going on.
2476220	2477740	Perhaps the most dangerous faction of all.
2477740	2479580	He's splintering my people.
2479580	2481820	Like, people are coming here to see you.
2481820	2483980	I see your t-shirt shop.
2483980	2485380	I saw your t-shirt shop.
2485380	2486860	I see you selling shit.
2490940	2492020	Why are you so mean?
2492020	2494460	You're so angry.
2494460	2497500	Anyways, Nazis, all I'm saying.
2498500	2501340	Look, Nazis, all you got to do, like,
2501340	2503580	because it's like, it's this, it's this faction of people
2503580	2506420	that are like, it's like, if you were to just be like,
2506420	2508580	oh, I'm going to get a swastika tattoo
2508580	2512580	and I hate everybody that's not me and like, I'm a Nazi.
2512580	2513620	How would you do that?
2513620	2515260	That's terrible.
2515260	2517420	Like the problem is that people that are like,
2517420	2519980	they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's this Nazi talk?
2519980	2520900	I don't like that.
2520900	2522060	You know what I am?
2522060	2524380	I'm a totally intellectual, logical guy
2524380	2525940	who hates overreaction.
2525940	2528420	I'd like to exterminate overreaction
2528420	2530180	with some logical discourse.
2530180	2532020	Why are you saying Nazi all the time?
2532020	2533540	That seems really hysterical.
2533540	2536660	I'm such a logical person that definitely not a Nazi.
2536660	2540340	I just happen to be arguing for calmness and discourse
2540340	2541700	and both sides of the thing.
2541700	2543340	And I'm like, you're a fucking closet Nazi.
2543340	2545100	You're just biding your time.
2545100	2547980	Like, and I just say to those people.
2547980	2550220	Why are you afraid of honest debate?
2550220	2552220	Yeah, like, why don't you keep talking to me
2552220	2553740	about whether or not we're Nazis?
2554380	2556340	Because I'm fucking exhausted already.
2556340	2558020	I'm a spoiled baby.
2558020	2559460	Can I start punching you yet?
2559460	2561980	Like, I've only got so much time left.
2561980	2563060	Jesus Christ.
2563060	2565700	I like to imagine the current day.
2565700	2568700	If Hitler was here now, there would be like some bunker
2568700	2572260	where he was like, we have 40,000 trolls.
2572260	2573380	We can send it Harmon.
2573380	2574220	Yes, yes.
2575660	2577300	I just say to those people, hey,
2577300	2579460	if you're really honestly for real,
2579460	2581260	you're like honest about this fact.
2581260	2582700	You're going like, you know what?
2582700	2584340	We're never going to turn Nazi.
2584340	2585940	This isn't anything.
2585940	2587540	Just, will you please,
2587540	2589460	you know what we help you so much?
2589460	2593020	Would you just Google 1933 Germany?
2593020	2595460	Because you think you're going to see a description
2595460	2600460	that's going to, like, just do an hour of fucking research.
2600460	2604460	And if I'm wrong, you will be so much more armed
2604460	2607180	and your next argument, you'll be able to go,
2607180	2609580	there's a lot of differences here.
2609580	2611740	But I'm afraid you're going to see,
2612740	2614900	that everything has a ramp
2614900	2617380	and that everything starts a certain way.
2617380	2622380	And that marginalization and institutionalization of it
2624100	2627460	is like, it all takes the same form in the beginning
2627460	2629820	and it's all very argued about
2629820	2633340	and people are always amorphous and blurry about it.
2633340	2638020	While regimes change hands and cabinets switch around
2638020	2639340	and everybody has these arguments
2639340	2640780	and it's like, the things that don't change
2640860	2643780	are just these brick on brick buildings
2643780	2646340	and policies and things where people are separated
2646340	2648740	and people are alienated and people are fucked.
2650220	2653620	Yeah, and there's like a long track record
2653620	2657700	of other bad fascist dictators in other countries
2657700	2660340	but it's not always like explicitly,
2660340	2663260	we disagree with Hitler on five things.
2663260	2665380	There's other guys, there's Pinochet.
2665380	2668300	I would love to, I like to, this is my style.
2668300	2671140	I love to jump the gun on my Hitler comparisons.
2671140	2672260	That's just me.
2672260	2675060	I'm a gun jumper on the Hitler comparison.
2675060	2679660	I like to not wait until it's actually Hitler.
2679660	2681780	The early bird gets the Hitler.
2681780	2685860	I'd like to be wrong a couple times.
2685860	2687420	Oops, that guy wasn't Hitler.
2687420	2690740	He just hated Jews and wanted to be Senator.
2690740	2694380	Oh well, down the drain you go.
2694380	2696900	Anti-Semitic Senator that would have done great things
2696900	2697740	for health care.
2697740	2700820	Fuck you, you reminded me of Hitler, too early.
2700820	2703820	That's the worst thing anybody's said about me this hour.
2703820	2704660	Yeah.
2706340	2708460	All right, let's move into the fun things.
2708460	2710340	Rob, take it away.
2710340	2711500	Entertain us.
2714340	2716540	Or I'll rip you from the arms of your mother
2716540	2718700	and stick you in a fucking cage.
2718700	2721340	Why, what, what, what did I ever do?
2721340	2723820	Fucking entertain me, you're part of the show.
2724060	2726940	Ask me some questions.
2726940	2728660	Oh, what about Transformers?
2728660	2729860	What about soda?
2732460	2735100	I like soda.
2735100	2737980	I'm okay with Transformers.
2737980	2740380	Hey, have you seen this with the toys
2740380	2742260	that made us on Netflix?
2742260	2744220	They did a whole Transformers, right?
2744220	2747300	A couple of them did a whole Transformers one.
2747300	2750940	And you're all great about, you love Transformers, right?
2750940	2752540	It's pretty cool, it's pretty cool.
2752540	2754100	You should check it out.
2754100	2755700	Check it out.
2755700	2758020	Can you name all five Dinobots?
2758020	2759300	All five Dinobots.
2759300	2760460	Okay, Grimlock.
2761900	2762740	So excited.
2762740	2763580	Scabies.
2763580	2765100	Grimlock smash.
2765100	2766060	Scabies.
2766060	2768500	Landing strip, two, what?
2768500	2771340	First it's Grimlock and then right to Scabies.
2771340	2772180	James.
2772180	2775020	Scabies was, when they formed the big thing together,
2775020	2778180	he would like layer over the skin of the big guy.
2779220	2780540	Oh man, how amazing was that?
2780540	2781380	Slag.
2782180	2785340	Uh, scarodactyl.
2785340	2786180	That's not funny.
2786180	2787020	I think you're thinking of a swoop.
2787020	2787860	Swoop.
2787860	2789380	Swoop would be the pterodactyl.
2789380	2790860	Swoop.
2790860	2791900	Snarl.
2791900	2793140	Snarl, thank you.
2793140	2793980	Snarl.
2795420	2798020	Snarf and Snarl used to hang out at craft services.
2798020	2799500	Trans-badginal mesh.
2799500	2800740	Did we do slag?
2800740	2801580	The slag came in again.
2801580	2803500	Slag is the triceratops.
2803500	2806020	Stomp, is that the Stomp?
2806020	2806860	Was that the Brontosaurus?
2806860	2809260	Was he in the Broadway show, Inspiration?
2810260	2811740	It was Rent.
2811740	2813060	It was Grimlock and Four Esses.
2813060	2815300	And Rent was the last one.
2815300	2818020	Grimlock and Four Essen.
2818020	2821660	Grimlock was the breakout star of the Dinobots.
2821660	2822780	He was the Joan Jett.
2824780	2826300	He was kind of an interesting transformer
2826300	2831260	because his head, his robot head was the size of a caper
2831260	2836260	and it was nestled deep within the chest of a T-Rex
2836900	2839220	with a much larger, more majestic head.
2840060	2843300	Well, a T-Rex would have a brain the size of a P, Daniel.
2843300	2845460	All right, so there it is.
2845460	2846940	Ipsofacto.
2848980	2851500	Rob, which-
2851500	2852740	Yes.
2852740	2853580	QED.
2853580	2858540	Which three transformers
2858540	2860980	do you think you could do a passable impression of?
2862140	2863740	Well, Starscream, probably.
2865060	2868460	James, can you do any transformers that aren't Starscream?
2868700	2870180	Oh, you're doing Starscream?
2870180	2871500	Oh yeah, I'll do Megatron.
2871500	2872340	Okay.
2872340	2874340	Okay, and then, Dan, you beat Grimlock.
2874340	2875180	Okay.
2875180	2876940	Okay, so let's do a little improv.
2876940	2880020	Can I get a place where three transformers might meet?
2880020	2881100	At a barbecue.
2882860	2886540	Do you have any gluten-free options?
2887460	2892180	Star-Scream, you're embarrassing me.
2892180	2897180	If I have a wheat bun, I'm going to get brain fog.
2897340	2899180	I am the leader of the Decepticons.
2899180	2902460	I will order for you, and there will be gluten.
2902460	2903300	Why?
2904500	2907580	I'm getting a rash on my knee.
2908580	2910620	Barista will take three inner-
2910620	2914620	Ooh, look who's here, Grimlock.
2914620	2916820	Ooh, fucky sucky.
2916820	2919780	Wow, why didn't you come over here?
2921820	2925500	Hey, hey, have you checked out
2925500	2928140	this slime-wave pornography?
2930580	2935420	Does that involve the false dicks, Starscream?
2935420	2940420	It involves fake penises that squirt Gs.
2943580	2944900	Fool!
2944900	2946460	Oh!
2946460	2949700	Grimlock likes slime-wave.
2951140	2954460	Grimlock have a nylon fetish.
2954460	2959140	Slime-wave, Grimlock not know that nomenclature,
2959140	2962220	but for a long time, Grimlock been consuming
2963180	2965460	lesbian strap-on porn,
2966780	2971780	in which women wear pantyhose and are shot in high definition.
2972740	2973580	Slime-wave.
2973580	2977060	And also have huge artificial tongs
2977060	2979700	that shoot a giant-
2979700	2983700	I transform it to a tiny slime-wave dick
2983780	2987580	that doesn't match the size I am as a robot.
2987580	2991140	I will hold you and shoot you.
2991140	2992900	That's sound wave, I'm sound wave.
2993900	2995140	Laser beak.
2997220	2999580	Transform.
2999580	3000620	Mission.
3000620	3001740	No way!
3001740	3003140	Two can play!
3006500	3007940	Blaster.
3009540	3012860	Oh man, we're really taking a beating over here, Optimal.
3014700	3018540	It's a tape deck versus tape deck.
3020180	3023860	It'll be the battle of the cassette, guys.
3023860	3027340	Hey, nobody calls Optimus uncharismatic.
3029380	3034380	First we crack the shell, then we crack the nuts inside.
3034700	3038500	Oh, Optimus Prime, well there's some crazy shit
3038500	3040260	going out out there.
3041260	3043700	I'm a scat man crawlers.
3044700	3047980	I play a robot named Jazz.
3051180	3055580	In one of history's more embarrassing chapters.
3059740	3061060	Second-
3061060	3065660	Well, I'm iron sides and I don't see a problem with it.
3065660	3068580	Oh, as long as we can get along,
3069260	3071780	I think that's fine.
3071780	3073700	I'm a red state minivan,
3073700	3077180	arguably the least fearsome of the Autobots.
3078780	3080900	I'm from Alabama.
3080900	3084580	I'd love to help you as a beneficiary of the coastal
3084580	3085420	and neat.
3092220	3095460	Can we get back to this slime-wave thing?
3095460	3100100	I mean, I'm not weird if I'm into it.
3100100	3103980	Grimlock already say love slime-wave,
3103980	3105660	not know it called that.
3105660	3109540	Your name for something more beautiful than that to Grimlock.
3109540	3114060	Empowered women fucking each other with giant fake dicks.
3114060	3117300	Grimlock like, look at their legs while they do it.
3118460	3122740	Star scream, pull me out of Grimlock's ass.
3125820	3127900	Oh, my foot.
3127900	3128740	You fool.
3130860	3131700	And seen.
3137980	3140940	I think the word fool is only ever said
3140940	3144140	by a villain to another villain.
3144140	3145780	It doesn't seem like that big of an insult,
3145780	3149420	but if you've added a vocal training, it really lands.
3149420	3150660	It sounds like-
3150660	3154780	Fool, you have failed to see the dangers of your hubris.
3154780	3157940	Why don't you eat all the shit?
3159260	3160100	Now you guys-
3160100	3162900	Because I'm going to fuck it when I'm large size.
3162900	3164180	Okay, all right.
3164180	3168140	Now you guys do, you do Cobra Commander
3168140	3169580	and you do Destro.
3169580	3170780	Oh, boy.
3170780	3173300	Isn't that the, that's the same two voices?
3173300	3174300	Yeah.
3174300	3176180	Yeah, but their status is flipped.
3178540	3180820	Cobra Commander.
3180820	3182140	Yes?
3183100	3185700	We're here in this empty void space
3185700	3188820	with no other suggestion or character.
3188820	3190020	You and me.
3190020	3192900	I've got a suitcase full of props.
3194420	3197700	Here is a salamander.
3198900	3201140	Here is a pair of scissors.
3201140	3202340	Okay, all right, all right.
3202340	3203180	Here's a-
3203180	3204020	Freeze, freeze.
3204020	3205940	I cannot get a style of movie.
3206860	3208860	Western, continue as a Western.
3208860	3211420	Here is a thick shooter.
3213060	3216580	That's not, that's all right.
3216580	3221580	If you reach for it, I'll have to obey you.
3223180	3225220	I'm reaching for it.
3225220	3227340	Very well, sir.
3228820	3231180	Hi, guys, it's me, Sir Pantor.
3233460	3235500	Why are you floating so high up there?
3235500	3236740	Come down here.
3236740	3239820	Yeah, why don't you come down here to our level?
3240820	3242180	I just want to let you guys know,
3242180	3244500	I really appreciate you making me out of the DNA
3244500	3246700	of six of the world's leaders.
3247900	3249620	Whatever that storyline was.
3249620	3250500	Yes.
3250500	3252900	Yes, it was Gorbachev.
3255780	3256620	Idi Amin.
3258180	3261260	I feel like it was like all of the world's conquerors
3261260	3263260	were the convenient sidestepping of the world.
3263260	3264100	Get off me!
3265580	3268020	Listen, I'm 14 now,
3268100	3271780	and I'm just living up in the attic room.
3271780	3275300	We always pushed you too hard at a young age.
3275300	3277340	I don't really think we need this guy here.
3277340	3278180	Excuse me, what?
3278180	3279020	Sorry.
3280100	3281820	I don't think, I just,
3281820	3284740	why would we have another big bad?
3284740	3288140	You know, we have, we are the position is taken.
3288140	3289500	Because you weren't good enough.
3289500	3292260	I didn't ask to be emulated.
3294340	3295500	Float, float.
3295500	3298740	Serpentor, Serpentor, Cooper, Commander.
3298740	3300500	The horizon, look.
3300500	3304060	The Joes, ground forces and air forces
3304060	3307060	are approaching at exactly the same speed.
3309140	3309980	Yee-haw!
3311380	3314260	From their nearby base.
3314260	3315980	Ski lift.

3375900	3377500	I'm, I, I'm, I, I'm, I'm,
3377500	3379500	What did barbecue sound like?
3379500	3381500	Same as iron sides.
3385500	3388500	Vinegar, ketchup, and a gun smoke.
3391500	3394500	All right, now I'll do the banana splits.
3395500	3397500	I'm kidding, and that's for Noah.
3399500	3400500	Spencer.
3400500	3401500	Hey, guys.
3402500	3409500	The G.I. Joe's base was always just a nice commute away from where Cobra was.
3409500	3411500	Yeah, I pitched it.
3411500	3414500	I want to do a show that's like...
3415500	3418500	I don't want to go all the way so ironic with it that it's like Robot Chicken,
3418500	3421500	but I want to do like a Mad Men level workplace comedy
3421500	3424500	that goes back and forth between G.I. Joe and Cobra.
3427500	3430500	Yes, it will be comedic, but on a grounded level, you know?
3430500	3435500	Like accepting the what if of what if these organizations existed.
3435500	3439500	Then just like all the instant fucking pressure that that puts everyone under.
3439500	3441500	What are the women in Cobra feel?
3441500	3442500	We're having problems with our funding.
3442500	3444500	The women in Cobra, they don't have HR.
3444500	3446500	You're not going to do bits of like, oh, Cobra has HR.
3446500	3448500	It's like you have women at work for Cobra,
3448500	3450500	and they're going to be like, I need to fucking assert myself.
3450500	3451500	It's like Orange is the New Black.
3451500	3455500	They have a fucking issue to deal with that is different from the women in G.I. Joe.
3455500	3458500	And then just everybody is just cracking all the time.
3458500	3463500	Just everybody like they just go like, so here's our here's our here's our here's our briefing
3463500	3467500	and then like go get on Yo Joe and then like just the camera just stays behind.
3467500	3469500	Just have people just like rub their eyes and just
3471500	3474500	and then just have somebody come in and just have that music going like.
3477500	3480500	Hey, can you can somebody pick up my laundry?
3481500	3483500	I'm so busy right now.
3484500	3489500	There was an episode I saw as an adult G.I. Joe and they obviously they
3489500	3491500	none of it's written as comedy.
3491500	3494500	So someone had to do this without making a joke out of it.
3494500	3496500	But the Joes like crashed.
3496500	3501500	They like crash landed into the Cobra base and it broke through the wall.
3501500	3506500	I swear to God into the Cobra cafeteria and there are all these Cobra guys with their lunch trays.
3506500	3507500	They were like.
3508500	3510500	And it was not played for laughs.
3510500	3513500	But they had to animate it and get it back from Korea.
3516500	3519500	Yeah. And I mean those guys there's like so much intermingling.
3519500	3521500	I mean like one guy's another guy's brother.
3521500	3525500	Like like if you're in Cobra or G.I. Joe you're you're in a fraternal organization.
3525500	3528500	You know like like oh snow steam.
3528500	3533500	My long lost twin from we were separated as children by a ninja.
3533500	3537500	Like because he's me but my action figures painted differently.
3537500	3542500	Maybe the Baroness has like a valid grievance against G.I. Joe's.
3542500	3545500	They scooped my eyeball out.
3545500	3547500	I was tortured by them.
3547500	3552500	Yeah. Yeah. Like they're always like oh so much for the compassionate left.
3555500	3557500	We never said we were left.
3557500	3559500	And I assume we were right wing.
3560500	3562500	Everyone's left of us.
3562500	3563500	Cobra.
3566500	3568500	Or are they do they consider themselves left.
3568500	3570500	That's that's amazing.
3570500	3571500	That's what we need right now.
3571500	3579500	We need Cobra and G.I. Joe engaged in adult dialogue so that the children that we are can start to understand how fucked the world is.
3580500	3584500	Because Cobra commander wouldn't be like you know I'm I'm kind of conservative.
3584500	3586500	Like he wouldn't consider himself conservative.
3586500	3589500	Perhaps horseshoe theory is valid.
3589500	3591500	The extreme right to the extreme left.
3591500	3593500	Come back to join.
3598500	3601500	Another another idea lost to the ages.
3601500	3602500	Lost to the age.
3602500	3609500	What do I got to do write a crazy script and put it on Twitter and you know be like look at that.
3609500	3610500	Yeah.
3611500	3614500	That's the most promising development process.
3615500	3619500	Write a fake thing put it on Twitter and then see if that works.
3630500	3632500	Let me see if I got I got one more thing.
3633500	3634500	Can you hold this James.
3634500	3637500	You want to stick around and listen to add James.
3637500	3640500	Do you want to stick around and play a little D&D with us to close the show.
3640500	3641500	Yes. Yes.
3641500	3642500	I am.
3642500	3643500	Oh is that time.
3643500	3645500	I only know how to play Axis and allies.
3645500	3647500	I'm out of my depth here.
3647500	3650500	Spencer can we can we dovetail some domes in here.
3651500	3652500	What.
3653500	3655500	Can we bring James into the game.
3655500	3656500	Yeah.
3656500	3657500	No. Yeah.
3657500	3658500	Which one.
3658500	3660500	Did I talk about that button.
3660500	3661500	Yeah.
3662500	3665500	Cody sent me this link to this article.
3665500	3674500	It says the headline says Ohio man sentenced after attempting to seduce undercover officer with chicken Alfredo.
3675500	3684500	And it's just an article about a guy who got basically you know he's like is an undercover officer in a chat room and this guy thought he was talking to a 15 year old boy.
3684500	3685500	Oh shit I lost it.
3685500	3686500	Slime wave.
3687500	3693500	And he and he and he was like I'll be there with slime wave is the perfect name for a transformer.
3693500	3694500	Yes.
3694500	3696500	There's shockwave sound wave.
3696500	3697500	Why not.
3697500	3698500	How come no ended slime.
3699500	3701500	He transforms into the day.
3701500	3702500	He.
3702500	3703500	He.
3703500	3704500	Just listen this is good.
3704500	3705500	We're going to button this up.
3705500	3706500	This is great.
3706500	3707500	Oh God.
3707500	3708500	Oh God.
3708500	3711500	He thought he was talking to a 15 year old boy online but it was actually an undercover Austin town police officer.
3712500	3714500	He arranged to meet the officer in Austin town.
3714500	3719500	He planned to bring lubricant sprite and chicken Alfredo to the date.
3721500	3722500	I'm telling.
3722500	3729500	Seven up just lost another customer 7 up if you're listening to this podcast.
3729500	3731500	Get in the game.
3731500	3732500	You are losing.
3732500	3733500	You are losing.
3734500	3737500	You've been losing for a while 7 up 7 up.
3737500	3739500	You've been losing.
3739500	3744500	I'm kind of fascinated when you did the Pac-Man commercial back in the 90s.
3744500	3745500	They're failing.
3745500	3748500	They're a failing lime and soda.
3748500	3751500	They're lemon and lime and they're failing at both.
3753500	3756500	We need to put thirst first.
3758500	3760500	That's the liberal alternative.
3760500	3762500	A thirst first.
3762500	3765500	I was trying to do Trump and talking sprite talk.
3765500	3766500	America.
3766500	3769500	When our calories go low their calories go high.
3770500	3773500	Oh you don't want high calories.
3774500	3778500	What I love about these local news articles because they're usually like this is California
3778500	3784500	news or Los Angeles news or like the desert region outside LA news and then there will
3784500	3789500	be like one comment and it's just like somebody was like it'll say like 18 hours ago so you
3789500	3795500	know like this is footprints in the snow like this person is not like this is not a hot spot
3795500	3800500	for this person but like there was a guy underneath this article that was like seven days.
3801500	3804500	Jeez no wonder we got a pedophile problem.
3804500	3806500	And it was like I kept looking at that.
3806500	3807500	Where do you get seven days.
3807500	3809500	I don't even know what he's talking about.
3809500	3811500	It's like it's like the ring.
3813500	3817500	Seven days by the way probably would be a good if he means seven days in prison I think
3817500	3824500	that would be pretty good for somebody who whose crime was like like meeting a meeting
3824500	3829500	a cop in a chat room that like got them to say I'll fuck you with some chicken.
3830500	3831500	I'm not.
3831500	3833500	That's all the FBI does.
3834500	3835500	Yeah.
3835500	3837500	They go in chat rooms and go hey you want to do a crime.
3837500	3841500	Yeah my heart goes out to law enforcement agencies.
3841500	3843500	Do you like heavy creams and sauces.
3845500	3851500	I feel like oh you're not going to make a headline by going FBI realizes that cycles
3851500	3857500	of abuse are the key and spends a bunch of money that will only pay off in 25 years when
3857500	3861500	this generation of abused children stops abusing the next generation.
3865500	3869500	J. Edgar Hoover left the time capsule that's going to make up for everything.
3869500	3872500	So there's like how do you get a pedophile.
3872500	3873500	How do you bust them.
3873500	3874500	We had a big bust.
3874500	3877500	We had a big pile of pedophilia on a table.
3877500	3880500	So they and that is something they go into like on the local news.
3881500	3886500	And then they're like we recovered five compact computers.
3887500	3889500	I'm 15.
3889500	3891500	I sure would like some chicken alfredo.
3891500	3893500	I don't know what I'd do for it.
3893500	3898500	44 kilos of chicken alfredo sauce in powdered form.
3899500	3901500	It's fucking cold here.
3901500	3902500	Is it.
3902500	3903500	It's fucking freezing.
3903500	3904500	Are you cold.
3904500	3905500	It's not.
3905500	3906500	Yeah.
3906500	3907500	It's good for last right.
3907500	3908500	Yeah.
3909500	3916500	Look in my view I feel that for far too long the top one percent of seven up has gotten
3916500	3920500	a far larger percentage of the bubbles than they deserve.
3922500	3929500	Over over over 60 percent of the bubbles available that are carbon dioxide the can of seven up
3929500	3935500	are going to the top point zero seven of the soda at the top of the can.
3936500	3940500	In my view we should flatten the soda remove all the bubbles
3940500	3943500	and we all get sweet light lime flavored syrup.
3947500	3949500	Lemon and lime should not be.
3949500	3952500	These are these are public resources.
3953500	3959500	I believe that the government there should be a government allotted amount of lemon and lime
3960500	3964500	and carbon dioxide and individual communities can do it at what they will.
3971500	3972500	I miss.
3972500	3975500	I didn't have any dinner me neither.
3975500	3976500	What.
3976500	3977500	Now I'm responsible for.
3978500	3980500	I had an aposta lunch.
3981500	3982500	Did you have chicken Alfredo.
3982500	3984500	I had a chicken Alfredo.
3984500	3985500	Was that you.
3986500	3987500	No.
3988500	3989500	I remember.
3990500	3993500	I had an impossible burger with Joel.
3995500	3996500	Nice.
3998500	3999500	Go on.
4000500	4003500	I don't feel like I was supposed to feel bad about not feeding you a minute ago.
4003500	4007500	Now you just tried to like no brag that you ate food with our friend.
4008500	4010500	You want to go for a baguette.
4011500	4012500	No way.
4012500	4013500	Okay.
4014500	4018500	I'm like a hold up in a bedroom eating protein bars like just waiting.
4018500	4021500	Like like whether I die or.
4032500	4033500	Shrops dropping on.
4033500	4035500	Maybe it's the power trying to come back on.
4036500	4040500	Shrops coming to Boston and he just told me backstage that he's fine coach.
4041500	4043500	Yeah something like that.
4043500	4044500	That's cool.
4044500	4046500	It took me a while before I got bumped up.
4049500	4053500	Oh you got to put it in the hours.
4055500	4057500	Going to go on to cradle con.
4057500	4061500	I'm going to be doing a panel and I'm hoping Spencer moderates it.
4061500	4062500	Yeah he was hoping.
4062500	4063500	Yep.
4065500	4068500	I would have got you a first class ticket to Boston.
4069500	4070500	I know.
4072500	4074500	Why don't we try to upgrade him.
4074500	4076500	I got to I got to go to DC in July.

4086500	4087500	He's on the show.
4088500	4089500	Fuck your buns.
4089500	4091500	Somebody take care of me.
4092500	4093500	God damn.
4093500	4094500	I've been drinking nothing but vodka.
4094500	4097500	I already booked Rob first class to Boston and back.
4097500	4098500	Wait a second.
4098500	4100500	Well that would make shrub a fucking liar.
4101500	4102500	Wait.
4102500	4104500	So I did it backstage when I found out.
4104500	4105500	He ate dinner.
4105500	4108500	He's flying first class.
4109500	4112500	This guy doesn't even know what slime wave is.
4113500	4114500	Jack Hughes.
4115500	4116500	Oh no.
4117500	4118500	Yeah.
4119500	4120500	Jack Hughes.
4120500	4121500	Why are you shaking your head at me?
4121500	4122500	I don't know.
4122500	4123500	Just you know.
4127500	4128500	Thank you sir.
4129500	4130500	All right.
4130500	4131500	Get out of here.
4134500	4135500	I'm sorry.
4135500	4136500	I mean why was it.
4136500	4138500	Why were you flying coach in the first place.
4138500	4139500	I don't know.
4139500	4140500	Why.
4140500	4141500	I don't want to shame anybody.
4142500	4143500	Well you'd be shaming him.
4143500	4144500	You didn't.
4144500	4145500	No no no.
4145500	4146500	No no no.
4146500	4147500	It's not.
4147500	4148500	Who is it.
4148500	4149500	Well who would it be on.
4149500	4152500	Look at this character that's on the the popcorn bag.
4152500	4153500	You look at him.
4153500	4154500	You love him.
4154500	4155500	Look at him.
4155500	4156500	He sees.
4156500	4158500	That's Bart Simpson's cousin.
4158500	4160500	He's saying awesome popcorn.
4161500	4162500	Look at that.
4162500	4163500	That's pretty fun.
4163500	4165500	I don't expect the venue to fly him out.
4167500	4168500	I know he's my burden.
4168500	4169500	No no no no.
4170500	4172500	They invited me out.
4172500	4173500	Beside.
4174500	4175500	Separate of you.
4179500	4182500	And so you went over my head and.
4182500	4183500	No.
4183500	4185500	And it turned out they'll only get you coach.
4185500	4186500	No.
4186500	4188500	I didn't go over anybody's head.
4188500	4189500	OK.
4189500	4190500	What airline is it.
4191500	4192500	Jet Blue.
4192500	4193500	They listen to the podcast.
4193500	4194500	No longer.
4196500	4197500	It's true. Yeah.
4198500	4199500	All right.
4199500	4200500	James you understand.
4200500	4201500	I had your droids.
4201500	4203500	You understand the basic idea here right.
4203500	4204500	No.
4204500	4205500	You're going to listen.
4205500	4206500	Do I have to pretend I get it.
4206500	4210500	You're going to listen to Spencer lay down the rules and watch the four of us make no
4210500	4211500	sense out of what's going on.
4211500	4214500	I did it once years ago and it was widely panned.
4214500	4216500	On this very podcast.
4216500	4217500	Did you.
4217500	4218500	Did you.
4218500	4219500	Did you.
4219500	4222500	Think of following up looking at some Reddit thread or something.
4222500	4223500	Oh no no no.
4223500	4226500	It was they sent they sent reviews to my house.
4228500	4229500	OK.
4229500	4232500	All right Spencer let me know when you're ready to go and we'll do a little recap.
4232500	4233500	Give me the pot.
4233500	4234500	Give me give it to me.
4234500	4235500	He's not going to eat that on top of it.
4235500	4236500	Give me.
4236500	4237500	I'm starving.
4238500	4239500	Fucking.
4239500	4240500	I fucked up.
4240500	4241500	I didn't think about it.
4241500	4243500	There's probably butter on it.
4243500	4244500	Yeah.
4244500	4246500	And there's probably butter on it.
4246500	4247500	You want some.
4247500	4248500	No.
4248500	4249500	Butter on it.
4249500	4251500	No popcorn is good for you.
4251500	4256500	But it's got whole grains they say which seems like a cheap.
4256500	4260500	It's got whole grains like corn like whole fucking kernels.
4260500	4261500	It's a whole grain.
4261500	4263500	That's as whole as a grain can get.
4263500	4265500	A whole kernel is a grain.
4265500	4266500	Corn doesn't seem like a grain.
4266500	4268500	Corn seems like a like a bunch of fruits on a stick.
4268500	4269500	It's a whole grain.
4269500	4271500	It's a whole bunch of grains.
4271500	4272500	Right.
4272500	4274500	I'm not going to write tonight.
4275500	4277500	Don't get to be one of your popcorn hazes.
4278500	4279500	Blackout popcorn.
4279500	4280500	Yeah.
4280500	4282500	Soapy's Choice fucking Kevin Kline.
4282500	4283500	I know you.
4283500	4285500	You'll have to fund poppy corns aren't you.
4289500	4290500	Thanks the facts.
4290500	4291500	All right.
4291500	4293500	Are we all ready to pay attention to Spencer now.
4293500	4294500	Yeah.
4294500	4295500	That sounded accusatory.
4296500	4297500	It's all good.
4297500	4298500	To them.
4298500	4299500	Right.
4299500	4300500	No I know.
4300500	4304500	I think you're accusing me of not being ready to be listened to.
4306500	4307500	All right.
4307500	4308500	Here we go.
4309500	4314500	Last time on Harmon Time our heroes were still in that fight.
4314500	4319500	They had gotten in that fight to find Patchens who had gotten in way over his head.
4319500	4322500	And they did get in way over their heads but they fought.
4322500	4328500	It was a good fight and they basically won because what happened.
4328500	4333500	A dwarf came out with a wiffle ball bat and teleported Jeff who is currently a tree into
4333500	4334500	a shed.
4334500	4336500	And then a bear showed up.
4336500	4338500	His name was Bernie Mac.
4340500	4346500	The fight finished when one of the guys dropped his gun and then someone I think it was Steve
4346500	4350500	like cut him real bad with the sword and he started screaming and crying.
4350500	4355500	And then like a dude came back to life and was a vampire and ran away.
4355500	4361500	Anyway find out whether or not they'll solve the mystery.
4364500	4365500	Thank you Spencer.
4365500	4373500	So let's look around the room and see what has the dust settled and we can look around
4373500	4374500	and see.
4374500	4376500	So Jeff you've made it back to the guys.
4376500	4379500	You're back in the underground of this theater house.
4379500	4381500	You're in the storage room.
4381500	4385500	And James you're playing Bernie Mac who's a bear that literally just showed up and can
4385500	4386500	talk.
4386500	4389500	So you could do what a bear can do.
4389500	4393500	Imagine being a bear that can talk pretty much there.
4393500	4396500	Like country bear jamboree.
4396500	4400500	Except more dangerous or the same amount of dangerous.
4400500	4406500	Didn't somebody die a long time ago the country bear jamboree at Disneyland?
4406500	4408500	Why are you looking at me?
4408500	4409500	It's not the D&D.
4409500	4411500	They got mauled by an animatronic bear.
4411500	4412500	It's called eyelines.
4412500	4415500	I don't want to upstage everybody by looking at this guy over here.
4415500	4422500	He came swinging down on a porch swing and then just mauled them.
4422500	4425500	So right in this theater we got Bernie Mac the bear.
4425500	4426500	Yep.
4426500	4428500	You got this guy who's screaming and bleeding.
4428500	4430500	Kind of like a hostage.
4430500	4434500	Everyone else is dead.
4434500	4435500	But I can talk.
4435500	4436500	Hey Carlos.
4436500	4440500	Carlos interrogate this guy before he bleeds out.
4440500	4442500	I interrogate this guy.
4442500	4443500	Okay.
4443500	4444500	How do you want to do it?
4444500	4447500	I put my foot on him.
4447500	4449500	No I can't do that.
4449500	4450500	I can't do that.
4450500	4453500	Classic criminology.
4453500	4459500	Well can I use a form of this spell?
4459500	4463500	You know I have like cure light wounds and I can use those to inflict wounds.
4463500	4469500	Would that be to say that I could like could I use my wound affecting energy to kind of
4469500	4478500	like basically magically open and shut his wounds?
4478500	4482500	You can do that but would take like basically the last of your magic because you've been
4482500	4484500	casting a lot of spells today so you're pretty low.
4484500	4485500	Well it should be worth it.
4485500	4487500	I'm sure it's going to be a jackpot of information.
4487500	4492500	I have the spell stabilize which can cause a dying creature to stabilize their condition.
4492500	4493500	So you can kill him.
4493500	4495500	I don't think we want him stabilized.
4495500	4503500	I think we're going to milk the fruit that is a man on the cusp of both worlds.
4503500	4508500	Wow.
4508500	4514500	You exist on the threshold of what the church of silver light regards is worthy.
4514500	4516500	You can make a choice.
4516500	4522500	Provide us with information that will guide the light to cleanse the world and slip back
4522500	4530500	into mortality or lose your grip forever and plummet in the margins of the forgotten.
4530500	4536500	Damn.
4536500	4538500	Not bad.
4538500	4541500	He goes oh yeah no okay.
4541500	4543500	What do you want?
4543500	4544500	That's crazy.
4544500	4549500	I just got into this because I love acting.
4549500	4553500	Yeah it seems like someone's acting like they don't have the information that we want.
4553500	4554500	I'm not.
4554500	4556500	Where is the gem.
4556500	4558500	I don't know what you're talking about.
4558500	4559500	Patrons gem.
4559500	4560500	No I'm kidding.
4560500	4562500	I don't say Patrons gem.
4562500	4563500	God damn it.
4563500	4564500	This is the part where I fail.
4564500	4565500	You can ask me questions.
4565500	4566500	I have a question.
4566500	4567500	Okay.
4567500	4568500	Am I the bear that mauled the guy?
4568500	4570500	Is that why he's been hurt?
4570500	4571500	Not that guy.
4571500	4572500	Oh okay.
4572500	4573500	You killed the other guy.
4573500	4575500	The guy you killed is dead.
4575500	4578500	Okay so I was worried you were undoing my work.
4578500	4579500	Sorry.
4579500	4584500	I look through the body of the dead man.
4584500	4586500	Okay he's already been looted by Jeff.
4586500	4594500	Okay I look through his body.
4594500	4596500	What does that mean?
4596500	4599500	I don't look through his clothes.
4600500	4604500	I look through his body because I'm like Swamp Thing.
4604500	4605500	All right.
4605500	4607500	So I'm gonna look inside.
4607500	4608500	Uh-huh.
4608500	4609500	Right?
4609500	4610500	Right.
4610500	4611500	What do I see?
4611500	4612500	What do you mean by look inside?
4612500	4614500	Like using extra sensory perception?
4614500	4619500	I look inside his body.
4619500	4621500	Okay.
4621500	4624500	You mean like looking inside his open wounds?
4624500	4626500	Like do you open him up?
4626500	4627500	Yeah.
4627500	4628500	His butthole?
4628500	4629500	Okay.
4629500	4630500	All right.
4630500	4636500	So I open up his mouth and I look inside his body.
4636500	4637500	Yeah.
4637500	4639500	Swamp Thing style.
4639500	4640500	Right.
4640500	4644500	He looks like a like a person.
4644500	4646500	You learn interesting things.
4646500	4647500	And?
4647500	4649500	About humans.
4649500	4650500	And?
4650500	4651500	That's all.
4651500	4654500	I didn't read Swamp Thing.
4654500	4655500	Or listen to it.
4655500	4657500	Was it a sound?
4657500	4661500	It was a sound.
4661500	4662500	Okay.
4662500	4667500	The environment gets mad at people and sends Alan Moore to write something.
4667500	4668500	No.
4668500	4674500	A snakey vine like down his throat and look around, you know?
4674500	4675500	Yeah.
4675500	4676500	Okay.
4676500	4677500	So the dead guy.
4677500	4678500	Yeah.
4678500	4679500	No.
4679500	4680500	He's normal but dead.
4680500	4681500	Okay.
4681500	4682500	All right.
4682500	4683500	Normally dead.
4683500	4684500	Yeah.
4684500	4685500	He's entirely president today.
4685500	4686500	Hey guys.
4687500	4689500	You guys see all that unfold?
4689500	4690500	All right.
4690500	4691500	Spencer.
4691500	4692500	Spencer.
4692500	4693500	You said I could ask you questions.
4693500	4694500	Yeah.
4694500	4695500	Yeah.
4695500	4698500	I would take a fucking like a lifeline there and go okay.
4698500	4699500	I'm drunk when we're playing this.
4699500	4700500	Yeah.
4700500	4702500	I don't remember over the spans of the ages.
4702500	4703500	Right.
4703500	4704500	Who could?
4704500	4706500	Like we were we were we were on this case.
4706500	4708500	We we traced these guys down.
4708500	4714500	It's like they like we're looking for the these like dragon born kind of dragon marked
4714500	4715500	guys.
4715500	4716500	Right.
4716500	4717500	A little bit.
4717500	4718500	So okay.
4718500	4720100	You came here looking for the gym.
4720100	4722260	You found that Shrove might know where the gym is.
4722260	4724700	You took Shrove hostage and he wasn't talking.
4724700	4728060	You found a tiny bit of information about a drop point but you didn't know where the
4728060	4729060	drop point is.
4729060	4730060	Right.
4730060	4731060	Okay.
4731060	4732740	He thought Shrove could help you out but he didn't and he fucked off.
4732740	4736180	So then you went looking essentially for more clues and that's where you are now.
4736180	4737180	Okay.
4737180	4738180	Still trying to find that drop point.
4738180	4739180	All right.
4739180	4740180	So here we go.
4740180	4741180	Where's Shrove?
4741180	4742180	Yeah.
4742180	4743180	There we go.
4743180	4744180	I don't know man.
4744180	4745180	I think he was fighting the fire.
4745180	4746540	That's what's happening right now.
4746540	4749260	You piece of shit.
4749260	4750580	I didn't do it.

4758140	4760020	Well where's Shrove?
4760020	4761020	I don't.
4761020	4762020	I don't.
4762020	4763020	I think he might be fighting fires.
4763020	4764020	Okay.
4764020	4765020	One more thing though.
4765020	4768260	The silver flame is not helping with the fires that are raging.
4768260	4769260	Right.
4769260	4770620	Thank you.
4770620	4772140	I could connect those dots.
4772140	4773140	That would be fine.
4773140	4774140	What are you guys talking about?
4774140	4776380	I want to ask you one more thing.
4776380	4777380	Wait.
4777380	4783300	So this is where Shrove and where's the drop point?
4783300	4786260	Probably where the fire is.
4786260	4787260	Let me.
4787260	4793100	No, I don't think it is, but it seems like the fire might get close if you don't hurry.
4793100	4795260	I'll tell you where it is.
4795260	4796420	Where it is.
4796420	4799740	It's in Boykin's pig farm.

4867780	4873580	You can call me Orson Welles, the bear.
4873580	4878060	So help me Christ Binkus if we go to that fire and it doesn't pan out for us and yes
4878060	4882180	you have to allow for the fact that we're inept so it might not work out for us through
4882180	4883520	no fault of your own.
4883520	4886020	We will be back and we will fuck you up.
4886020	4887420	We'll fuck up your family.
4887420	4892360	We will rip the children from your mother's arms and we will put them in things that
4892360	4897500	we convince people aren't cages and if they still convince us they're cages we'll say
4897500	4900420	it was Obama's idea.
4900420	4905700	We can go round and round Binkus.
4905700	4907980	I'm trying to help.
4907980	4909100	How do we get to the pig farm?
4909100	4910100	Which direction is it?
4910100	4911100	North.
4911100	4912100	Wait.
4912100	4913100	Guys.
4913100	4916300	I have no direction so I can discern north.
4916300	4917300	Oh.
4917300	4918300	That way.
4918300	4919300	Alright.
4919300	4920300	Follow me motherfuckers.
4920300	4926020	Am I cool to join you guys?
4926020	4927020	Yes please.
4927020	4928020	Yes please.
4928020	4932380	I'm not sure if I'm loyal to your party but it seems fun for now.
4932380	4937100	A lot of people that have no direction you're not supposed to follow.
4937100	4941340	No one tells bear rules.
4941340	4944980	Okay so you head outside and there is indeed a fire.
4945660	4950980	It started by the tavern and it's grown wildly out of control on account of the town is protected
4950980	4956460	by a big flammable wall so it's starting to engulf the town as you head north to Boykin
4956460	4958700	Hodges pig farm which you do.
4958700	4961500	Did we start this fire?
4961500	4965380	We didn't start the fire.
4965380	4969100	It was always burning arguably.
4969100	4974540	It seems too big to have started it but you do remember starting a fire.
4975220	4980020	It wasn't my brand of cigarettes.
4980020	4986380	You go to the pig farm it's it's like a farmhouse with like a little with a little no sorry
4986380	4992220	it's a farmhouse with a barn so then the barn is next to the stablery which is like a customer
4992220	4997100	facing stablery where you put your own horses and stuff and then out the back behind the
4997100	5000500	barn that's where all the pigs is.
5001220	5003860	We got to save these pigs.
5003860	5004860	Pigs are in back.
5004860	5010260	No but we have to find so we should we should have asked specifically where the drop point.
5010260	5011260	Who?
5011260	5015020	Bingus we should have we should have asked him.
5015020	5016020	You can ask him.
5016020	5022660	Oh Bingus was specifically where at the pig farm like because a point sounds very specific.
5022660	5029180	Oh yeah I'll tell you it's in this corner of the third pig stable.
5029180	5030180	Thank you.
5030180	5035220	Oh so help me Christ Bingus if you're lying.
5035220	5041460	Do we have to throw birds at it though all the pigs to make them fall down.
5041460	5044820	I don't know nothing about no pig fighting.
5044820	5053140	Bingus if you're lying I'm going to wear your ass like a face mask.
5053140	5059300	I'm going to go for trick or treat as your ass and it's going to be one of those costumes
5059300	5064820	where it's just most of the attention is put into the plastic your ass face and then
5064820	5070980	the rest is just a plastic apron with a picture of you from head to toe on it which a lot
5070980	5074900	of people will point out it's not a costume.
5074900	5079620	With a singular hold before your mouth or your one eye.
5079620	5080700	For one eye probably.
5080700	5082740	I don't think Bingus wants to find out.
5082740	5083740	Okay.
5083740	5087540	Yeah man I don't know you should talk to Boykin Hodge.
5087540	5088540	We'll talk to him.

5202220	5203220	All right.
5203220	5209780	So you go back to the pig area and you see appear almost as if supernaturally like this
5209780	5211980	crazy old bald guy.
5211980	5220260	He looks like a really angry farmer like a like an old hard worn farmer sir.
5220260	5223180	He goes.
5223180	5225580	Are you choking.

5227900	5228900	You all right.
5228900	5229900	He points to his voice.
5229900	5232260	He's about to have vocal surgery points.
5232980	5235660	He points to a big button on his chest.
5235660	5236660	He points.
5236660	5237660	What.
5239300	5240940	I think I think he does it.
5240940	5242260	I think he can't speak.
5242260	5245940	I think he's lost the ability to point to you while he points at me.
5245940	5246940	He points at you.
5246940	5250020	Well he's I can speak.

5266900	5267900	Darth Vader would nod.
5267900	5269580	He looks at you quizzically like he does.
5269580	5273940	Do you know who Darth Vader is.
5273940	5274940	Can anyone.
5274940	5275940	Does anyone.

5278860	5279860	Well listen.
5279860	5280860	We're here.

5281860	5282860	I can.
5282860	5288540	I can do sign language but whenever I do I accidentally slash people with my claws.
5288540	5291860	You have bad depth perception.
5291860	5293300	We're bigger than I think.
5293300	5294940	We're here for the drop.
5294940	5295940	Yeah.
5295940	5299780	He just looks at you like he doesn't he doesn't know you're saying.

5302220	5303220	He shakes his head.
5303220	5304220	No.
5304220	5305220	No.
5305220	5306220	You have a gym.
5306220	5307220	He.
5307220	5308220	Waiting for a gym.
5308220	5311660	He squints his head and he goes no.
5311660	5313980	You waiting for a delivery.
5313980	5319820	He thinks like he's remembering and then he goes out outside out around back of his
5319820	5320820	house.
5320820	5321820	He goes.
5321820	5322820	Hey.
5322820	5323820	Hey.
5323820	5324820	Where are you going.
5324820	5325820	Oh.
5325820	5326820	I guess we follow him.
5326820	5329100	When you said this guy appears you don't mean like ethereally.
5329100	5330100	No.
5330100	5331100	But like.
5331100	5332100	He's a normal guy.
5332100	5334980	Like in those scenes where it's like a creepy guy and it's like oh he wasn't there.
5334980	5335980	You know.
5335980	5336980	Out of the shadows.
5336980	5337980	Yeah.
5337980	5338980	Okay.
5338980	5339980	Blood Archer.
5339980	5340980	Right exactly.
5340980	5341980	Okay.
5341980	5342980	That's exactly the trope I was trying to hit.
5343980	5344980	Well.
5344980	5346980	I can't take this guy.
5346980	5347980	But look.
5347980	5351940	Did he walk out beckoning us to follow or he just walked out.
5351940	5353300	He was being creepy about it.
5353300	5354300	So you couldn't tell.
5354300	5355300	Okay.
5355300	5356300	I.
5356300	5357300	Like.
5357300	5361100	What's my like seeing where I conjure up like a light so we can see in the darkness
5361100	5362100	of the pen.
5362100	5363100	Dancing lights?
5363100	5364100	Sure.
5364100	5365100	Yeah.
5365100	5366100	Sure.
5366100	5367100	I just have light.
5367100	5368100	I can make things a torch.
5368100	5369100	Oh yeah.
5369100	5370100	Okay.
5370100	5371100	So I reached out and picked up a stick.
5371100	5372100	Poof it's a torch.
5372100	5373100	I don't know that he was in.
5373100	5374100	The corner he was in?
5374100	5375100	Boy.
5375100	5376100	Just the whole pen.
5376100	5377100	Wait.
5377100	5378100	Say that again.
5378100	5380300	I examined the pig pen that we discovered.
5380300	5383060	So you are following him then.
5383060	5384060	Okay.
5384060	5385060	I.
5385060	5386060	You.
5386060	5387060	Did he get up and leave the pig pen or he still?
5387060	5388860	You didn't get quite to the pig pen.
5388860	5389860	Oh okay.
5389860	5390860	Oh.
5390860	5393220	We thought that we were arriving at the pig pen and meeting him.
5393220	5394220	Right.
5394220	5395220	Right now he was just like.
5395220	5396220	Okay yeah.
5396220	5397220	Sorry.
5397220	5398220	Sorry if I was wrong.
5398220	5399220	Let's follow him.
5399220	5400220	Let's see where this leads.
5400220	5401220	Okay.
5401220	5405980	So he comes back to the pig pen and he goes and stands in front of the third one and he's
5405980	5407900	just kind of like looking at it.
5407900	5408900	Looking in the corner.
5408900	5409900	And he goes.
5409900	5410900	All right.
5410900	5414900	Will somebody give this guy the Heimlich?
5414900	5415900	Heimlich?

5428900	5429900	I.
5429900	5430900	I.
5431280	5432240	I.
5432240	5433240	Well.
5433240	5435100	We had you had.
5435100	5437280	You have those muddy sacks.
5437280	5438280	I.
5438280	5439300	I leap on that sack and I.
5439300	5440300	And I.
5440300	5441300	And I open it up.
5441300	5442300	Oh,.
5442300	5443300	What do we do it?
5443300	5444300	What is...
5444300	5445300	I look inside.
5445300	5446300	There's a gem.
5446300	5447300	Oh.
5447300	5448300	God dammit, we did it.
5448300	5449300	Oh!
5449300	5450300	We fucking did it.
5450300	5451300	Outrageous!
5451300	5452300	You.
5452300	5453320	We did everything wrong and it led to.
5453320	5454320	Outrageous!
5454320	5455320	We got it.
5455320	5456320	We Whereas?
5456320	5457320	Patches gem.
5457320	5458320	Where is Patches?
5458320	5459980	Truly outrageous.
5459980	5465220	about this farmer can I maul him for fun? Well as you say that it seems like
5465220	5469780	well everyone's excited over the gym he's picked up a brick and it started creeping towards you.
5469780	5474140	Creeping towards us? Yeah with a big brick in his hand. I'm telling you let me maul the guy.
5474140	5501460	You don't come here for the gym drop-off do you?
5501460	5510580	Guys do we need like another like monster like in our group? I mean like I mean do we need one?
5510580	5521100	I cast dazzle so we can't see. Well the bear attacks first hold up. Oh so I hold on to my
5521100	5528540	dazzle but I got it like it's up here. You're it's ready to go. All right so yeah the Orson
5528540	5534740	Wells attacks attacks hot a blinkin' hodge and and you just get him you smack him in the face
5534740	5539580	and then you just bite him right in the chest and you just start ripping him apart and he starts
5539580	5545980	hissing and screaming he's like and he's screaming and his teeth are sharp and it seems like he's a
5545980	5559780	vampire. You're eating a vampire. I don't know how the rules work does that make me contagious? You
5559780	5565900	also don't know as a bear. Should I get a tetanus shot? Shit I'm a cleric I'm a cleric
5565900	5573300	god damn it I'm a cleric. I think you're out of magic now because you've used it on the guy. Yeah
5573340	5585420	but you have to have faith. You ever see Fright Night? That's fair. Okay I'm out of magic. I'm
5585420	5592140	out of magic. That's that's fine. I'm sure there's some passive ability to turn vampires. What's
5592140	5596580	what's our proximity like to each other in two boinkins? You're within ten feet of each other.
5596580	5603620	I have a question. Yeah. When I'm a shambling mound okay so I'm you know like a plant creature
5603620	5610380	right? Right. Is there any wood in me? Yeah there's some woodier kind of branches. You see where I'm
5610380	5618460	going with this? Yeah yeah yeah. Okay I go up to him and I do one of these. Oh that's not I thought
5618460	5623900	like a steak in the heart I thought a steak in the heart. I didn't know you were gonna. There's no
5623900	5629260	Jesus in this world. We thought you were gonna sacrifice one of your limbs so that we could
5629260	5636420	stake him through the heart. What are we gonna wait for Christ to be born? Oh I'm sorry okay.
5636420	5642380	I did it wrong so we'll do it your way. Your steak. Steak through the heart. That's got to be
5642380	5648620	dimensionless. Do you have a hammer? What? Do you have a hammer? You don't need one it's your fists.
5649340	5655660	Just punch him. Okay I'll punch him with one one of my stick fingers. Aim for his heart.
5655660	5663500	Aim for his heart and then bear you can hammer his elbow if that's all right okay. I honestly
5663500	5676580	think we only need one monster. I think that's a little bit turf war ish. Yeah. I'm not disputing
5676580	5686500	that but everybody else is being cool. All right okay. Look I eat stuff that you guys don't like
5686500	5694100	some of your allies and other creatures. Can I finish what I started here? Stick my finger in his
5694100	5701060	heart. All right as he's being mauled by the bear he's pretty easy to hit with your with your steak
5701140	5708580	fingers and you stake him right in the chest. Nice. And he he explodes into dust around a skeleton.
5708580	5717140	Yeah. You did it. Gay shambling. He did it. Oh I wanted to eat him.
5718900	5725220	Can I collect some of the dust and put it in my glass jar? Yep. I do that. That's probably a
5725220	5732020	crafting ingredient. You don't know. What? What? It's probably a crafting ingredient. It's a keepsake.
5732020	5738900	It's vampire dust. What are you shaking your head? You're made out of swamp leaves. Hey you know
5739620	5746020	you're made out of meat. Okay is that a threat? I just want to collect some vampire dust.
5746020	5753940	Like nothing says back to school like vampire dust. Okay well guys we did it. We got pachins
5753940	5758020	gem. Where's pachins? Do we know this is pachins gem? What if it's just another? Of course it's
5758020	5766100	pachins gem. You got a strong sense. I uh I I loot to the uh I go to the uh to Boink Boinkins's
5766900	5773220	clothing. You get 17 gold as well as a compass. I split it. I split it up evenly amongst the
5773220	5778020	five of us. You all get three gold. All right we need this gem put somewhere where it will not
5778020	5784660	be waylaid. You know while they're doing that I'm just gonna Spencer while they're doing that
5784660	5792820	I'm just gonna kind of wander out alone. I just need to be alone for a bit. All right guys let
5792820	5798260	them let them go. Just like just let them just like how long is the bear gonna last? That's not a
5798260	5803700	summon bear I don't think. I'm gonna split with my share of the gold ASAP. Because I keep thinking
5803780	5811940	like the best place to hide a gem is my ass. A bear's ass. Like who's ever gonna rob? I walk away
5811940	5818260	from all of this. You know they can argue about all that and I'm just gonna kind of just I'm gonna
5818260	5824180	walk. I'll have you know I do shit in the woods. I follow Gary Shambling. I follow him okay. I don't
5824180	5828820	know if he'd like that. Well I don't expect him to. There needs to be a transition. Hey Gary.
5829780	5836260	I'm sitting on the road. Gary. I'm just like kind of like looking at the dirt and playing with
5837060	5841620	with a rock that I found that I'm just like yeah what.
5844100	5849540	Killed me. Couldn't have killed that vampire without you. Thank you. Yeah I know.
5850420	5859460	Helped us get Patchen's gem. It's just it's not fun anymore. You say anymore but this was your first
5859460	5866900	adventure. I've been doing this a long time and it gets worse than this. I just I'm just like I
5866900	5875060	didn't let my dog out before I left this place. Gary. I'm just starting to worry that it's that
5875060	5879940	this is good as it's gonna get. I mean like I mean I thought it would be more than this and
5879940	5886580	it's just like we're we're hurting people and I don't know what are we the good guys or the bad
5886580	5892740	guys. Sometimes we're the bad guys and it often coincides with us being disunited and confused
5892740	5897060	about what we did last week. And that's why it seems like we're always talking over each other.
5897220	5904180	Yeah well that's why I mean the cure to this problem is commitment to a weekly schedule
5904900	5912820	and people people showing up and and and listening and and and and give and take and all this stuff
5912820	5918260	and I know that it would be better with you you know and I want to invite you. I mean I'm just
5918260	5923780	like with the bear is it right. I mean are we gonna get another bear. This bear is here to plug
5923860	5930100	some fucking improv show he's doing. Like we don't even know. This bear is here today.
5930100	5935300	Mind if I just pop over. I'm in the Sunday company at the Groundlings.
5937060	5941300	It's my last six months so if you could want to pop by.
5943380	5946500	I've got flyers but they're a little claw shredded.
5946500	5949300	Look I mean.
5952500	5954500	Karen Mariama is my teacher.
5956740	5959860	Of course we're gonna come to your show. Great great great.
5962820	5966020	Now there's a limit. I can only get three people. Oh okay well
5967060	5970820	I thought I saw Del Close over there by the bushes.
5970820	5982420	Anyways Gary we'd love for you to continue to be a part of our our gang. Okay but
5983940	5986660	I'm up inside the farmhouse trying to loot the farmhouse.
5991780	5996820	All right all right well I could I could probably I could probably hang out for another
5996820	6000740	day or two. But if the bear stays is it a deal breaker.
6002660	6008900	I was like I started you know like carving out like a niche and and then all of a sudden he's
6008900	6016340	like all over. I don't know it's it's whatever. I mean it's just been rough you know like I I'm
6016340	6021940	just really tired. I need to I should I missed. It's fine. It's fine. It's a bunch of shit. Don't
6021940	6028820	worry about it. Mind if I offer a just to say if I'm passed on at the groundlings.
6030420	6036980	I probably will have to go do that anyway. So I mean for me to continue being here and bothering
6036980	6043140	you I would have to not pass the Sunday company ground. You know it's my stupid. I'm wandering
6043140	6047780	around the front room with my with my flashlight. It's still like checking things out. I I grew up
6047780	6053780	charlotte the most adorable pig and I and I walk over to Gary and I'm like this look at how cute
6053780	6059620	this little pig is. She loves you. That's a sex pig. Cliff Hanger.
