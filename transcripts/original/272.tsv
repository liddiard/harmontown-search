0	29840	Hello everybody, my name is Jeff B. Davis and I'm back at Harman Tower.
30800	35520	From Burbank, California. Harman Town is now in session.
39280	45680	Oh yeah, hello everybody. From beautiful uptown Burbank, Harman Town is once again in session.
45680	49680	I'm happy to be back. My name is Jeff, your comptroller. Let's give it up for the Game Master
49680	53440	ex-terordinaire Spencer Crichton Dunn.
58400	62720	He's lost a little bit of weight, but it doesn't mean he's lost his powers.
63520	67600	Let's hear it for the mayor of Harman Town, Daniel Harman.
79680	90880	My name is Beat Master. I do the beats and I do it much faster than slower beat people
90880	96960	that are too proud to be doing slow beats under a shroud. They got a shroud made of slowness and
96960	102720	beats. They go, look at me, I can't be beat. And I say, no, you're slow and I'm much faster. And
102720	106880	that's why they call me the Fast Beat Master. Now sometimes I feel like I gotta ask you,
106880	111040	how could you rap so much faster than other rappers? You just rap so much that you're like
111040	117040	the Rap Master. Well, my secret is simple. I pop slow rappers like a pimple. I squeeze them from
117040	122320	the outside to the center. And when I go back inside, I find a more benter than ever. They're
122320	128720	bent in half sideways and they say, why'd you do that? You gave me a ride. Jeez. Over the years,
128720	133680	we have never backed off on the quality of the problems. Just listen to Professor Kensington,
133920	140800	who I sampled at my rap classes. Now fast rapper, you don't seem to be rapping particularly fast
140800	146720	so far. Are you gearing up to a really fast rap? I'm glad you asked that. I'm going to answer it
146720	152240	right now. Fast rap. I'm a slave to the beat I'm provided. I fucked your mama so hard. It was her
152240	158320	pussy that I ride. And the beat sometimes drops out, but that puts emphasis on what I'm about to
158320	163840	shout. I just got to go with the beat that I know. I'm a slave to the beat. It's how I flow.
163840	169680	When the beat comes out, that's what I do. It comes from my head to my mouth and then my shoe.
169680	174800	And my shoe, the beat goes to my toe. After it goes from my toe, it goes, I don't know.
174800	179680	That's no longer my problem after it leaves my foot. It goes into a chimney and maybe dies in
179680	185200	soot like Santa Claus coming from the North Pole. Fuck your mama so hard. She's got an extra hole.
185200	190560	It's a USB port. It charges my phone. I fucked your mama, but it was consensual. Now she's alone.
191280	198000	She broke it off with me. I fucked your mama. Then I took a pee. This is the bridge.
199120	205200	Fast rapper. Can I ask you a question? Yes, of course. Fast rapper is famous for his accessibility.
207520	209680	Your rhymes are so delicious. They're almost yummy.
209680	212720	Is it true that you rap faster when you lift up your shirt and show us your tummy?
212720	221280	Yes. Fast rapper, faster rapper with so much tummy. Gonna fat rap so fast it's gonna be extra
221280	225920	yummy. Gotta eat some candy down here and the mama looking fat and the face showing my stomach.
225920	230720	And what do you think about that? You treating me like chunk on the Goonies. I don't like it. I'm not.
237040	239280	You can put your shirt back down. You can put your shirt back down. It's okay.
242720	254160	What was his name? Actor, a famous child actor. We have never backed off on the quality of our
254160	260080	ingredients. If you're a five ninety nine six man. He played an Asian fella in the breakfast at
260080	265040	Tiffany's. Short round. Oh, Mickey Rooney. Mickey. Mickey. All right. Well, that was a good rap.
265040	268480	That was a good rap. All right. Anything we can do to keep the energy up when we start the show.
268480	271840	That's what's important. Oh, boy. Good to see you, Dan. Happy New Year. Happy New Year,
271840	275680	Spencer. I haven't seen you guys in a long. Yeah. Where have you been, Jeff? I was in India,
275680	281040	California. No, Asia, India, near East Asia, India, California, India. No, I was in India
281040	285200	with church and we had a we had a big time. Sometimes they get excited when we take these
285200	288160	long breaks because I'm like, oh, man, we're going to have so much to talk about. But then
288160	293360	we can go so long that we have nothing to talk about. Oh, yeah. We have plenty to talk about.
293360	298000	We can't really remember anything. Your house got run into by a drunk driver. There you go. And
298080	305040	you're living in a hotel now like a fancy person. Yeah. A dude ran an Acura into my garage at about
305040	310880	40 miles an hour, as far as I could tell. More like an inaccurate. That was Dan's joke.
311680	316720	I stole Dan's joke. But for that first first two seconds, you thought I was a fucking genius.
316720	320400	It depends on what he was trying to do. It might be the most accurate in the world
320400	326720	if he was trying to take out my garage. But I don't think so. Because you live right at the
326720	330800	top of a hill, which is like like a skateboard ramp that you can just drive straight into your
330800	337200	garage. And that guy did it. Yeah, he I think he was trying. I looked at my security cameras and
337200	342240	because I'm Batman and they don't really get down that far that you could actually see what's going
342240	348080	on. But you see headlines coming up. What are the cameras? There's a camera on the wall that he took
348080	354400	out. So it's like you know what time he hit because it just the wall just the camera just
354400	360800	changes position. And then one of the cameras you can see headlights like, you know, ripping up the
360800	365600	street and then and then they just disappear. And then there's footage of one dude, the passenger
365600	369360	just boning out. He just he just gets out of the car and leaves his friend there to die. Passenger
369360	375440	driver. I don't know. Yeah. The cops made it clear that they did not know whether the guy that ran
375440	380480	was the driver or a passenger, which makes me think which confirms the fact that the cops were
380480	387600	not chasing these guys or at least they were not on their tail because Cody and I heard a boom
388320	392720	that sounded to us like somebody was like kicking the back door of the house.
394080	399440	And I went downstairs and I went out back with my police dog Harvey and let him run around the
399440	403920	backyard. And it's like there's nobody out here. I wonder what that big boom was. Somebody kicking
403920	414080	our door and then went to the front of the house. And there were cherries flying like kind of
414080	421760	illuminating the dark living room. And down by my garage, there were six squad cars in the street
422720	428080	with the silhouettes of police all with their guns drawn and shouting, which you've never you've
428080	433840	heard a million times in movies, but you've I've never heard in real life. Just like, get on out,
433840	439280	get out, get out, get out. Just everybody shouting different shit at the same time.
439280	446400	Get out of the car, get on the ground, hands in the air. Don't move. It's no wonder that a lot of
446400	453440	people get shot by the police. Really. Yes, there's a lot of mixed messages. And of course,
453440	456960	Cody was on mushrooms, which I thought was a great choice for that particular moment.
456960	463600	And I wasn't on him. She was coming back from a from a get together with some with some
465280	470080	great influences. Were you commenting the whole night as the police were doing their work that
470080	476400	it was really great that Cody had done those mushrooms? Yes. It felt like it kept coming up.
477440	480160	To whom? Just people in the neighborhood.
483840	487840	That I don't who's I don't I don't I don't know if you're doing a joke or what.
487840	492240	Yeah, no, I am. He was doing a very, very subtle, subtle esoteric bit.
492240	495440	All right. Yeah, I kept telling everyone in the neighborhood that she was on mushrooms.
496240	505600	That's basically my joke. Yeah. It I and so we had the thing is that the the collision with my
505600	516960	garage took out a quarter of a wall of my garage that then was moved into the front of my gate that
518400	527760	lets you into up to my house. Hashtag privilege hashtag what neighborhood do you live in? But yeah,
527760	534000	it's that's part of it is I was really actually this is like this is a story about how cool it
534000	541040	is to have a little bit of money because my garage is not it's down by the street and I have
541040	547840	insurance and I have I think it's essential that garages be on the street. I have assistance always
547840	554880	to be an advantage and up a flight of stairs. And so you guys are you guys are hilarious.
555680	562800	Thank you. The garage garage is typically in a normal average American home would probably be
562960	570320	kind of connected to the house attached. And so someone smashing into it might kill your daughter
570320	577040	or dog or or destroy your you know, more than just some of your property. So is what I meant.
577040	582720	And because I have a more sprawling estate because the the average American family keeps
582720	591200	their daughter in the garage with the snake tank and yeah, nothing really got what got
591200	597600	fucked up was a there was a pipe in the wall of my garage. I do find this a little I guess I
597600	604240	shouldn't be surprised by this. I guess water pipes are like veins or arteries. They run
604240	608960	everywhere. If you break it at any point, there's just like there was like when I went down there,
608960	616240	there was cop lights and there was this huge carport that had been my garage because they just
616240	622720	took out the whole door of the garage. And then there was this very cinematic spraying of water
623280	627360	like that. That's always a part of every car wreck in the movies through like like even though
627360	631680	there was no fire hydrant involved, there was just like the sound of like I felt like it was
631680	636480	like a diehard movie or something like it's just like there was there was just water everywhere.
636480	641200	And the cops kept saying you got to call the DWP and have them shut off the water because
641200	647280	otherwise this is bad and I had to do that and for that reason and the fact that the the wall
647280	655360	of the garage is blocking my gate and like like it this is a this is a thing that would have crippled
655360	663680	the life of of a normal person like I but I had Steve Levy who you know fresh back from his
663680	670720	vacation was able to get me and Cody into a hotel room a suite in fact in West Hollywood where we
670720	677760	were able to spend New Year's Eve with my friends and it's actually I I hate to admit it but it's
677760	684720	kind of been a blast having a guy drive into my garage and destroy your daughter my daughter
685520	692000	uh because it didn't really I I'm the last person that it actually affected but don't don't rip
692000	700560	this video and use it in his I don't know court case I don't want I don't necessarily need this
700560	707520	guy to suffer either I mean I I need him to have insurance and uh pay for my garage construction
707520	714000	but uh so I don't think I don't think he can use me saying yeah it's kind of fun having you destroy
714000	720240	my garage uh against me in any way because it still needs to be rebuilt but hopefully he's okay
722000	729120	hopefully his friend didn't do anything desperate in Amy Mann's backyard uh when he ran eastbound
729120	734720	up into the hills of Las Feliz I almost murdered Amy Mann she was coming down the corner on her
734720	741120	beach uh beach cruiser bicycle and I almost completely demolished her she was just jamming
741120	746880	around the corner like I have like three phone numbers of people that I know live in the direction
746880	752320	that the kid ran that I saw running from the car so I like went through my phone I'm like who lives
752320	757360	over there I'm just gonna warn him this guy in foot he's running from the cops he could he could
757360	764400	actually if he's desperate he could actually do something crazy maybe it's actually better these
764400	768000	cops they see him I'm not gonna I don't I'm not throwing them under the bus they don't
769120	773200	they they're admitting they haven't found the guy they don't I don't know how well they're doing
773280	777360	at finding him I'm gonna I'm just gonna I'm just gonna text a couple warnings to
778160	782400	a couple people that I know live in that direction and one of them was uh Edgar Wright
782400	787040	director of baby driver and then halfway through the message I was like wait a minute what am I
787040	792080	doing this is his fault I'm sure this guy uh watched baby driver yeah exactly like stop making
792080	799040	those movies Edgar or live with this guy in your pool shed um welcome to your fucked up version of
799040	804240	et where you have to befriend this guy and get him back home to England apparently both the driver
804240	808000	and the passenger were not injured though right the only real tragedy of this was that we found
808000	813840	out that you have a sad segue in your garage it was truly and I'm not being I mean yeah it's become
813840	819440	a joke but it's really it really is like what it really was the most embarrassing thing first it
819440	825040	started with the LAPD making fun of the segue and and and that's part of it is like you only have to
825040	829120	mention the segue to make fun of it like like so the LAPD was like I was like what's the damage
829120	832640	like over there I can't even get out the gate to sea and they're like don't worry bro the segue is
832640	841440	okay there there was segue shaming yeah but then Cody's like how's my Prius or you know she's on
841440	848240	mushrooms so a more accurate thing would be like how's my Prius um and then but then and then the
848240	853040	cops were like like other than the fact that it's a hybrid and then I was like okay I see your formula
853040	857760	you can take your hybrid shame and you can you can put it in the i'll take it i'll put it in the bin
857760	864800	with all the cop insults you know you guys just have a formula here uh but uh yeah they were
864800	869600	hybrid jamming too they were high you know it's it's cop humor what are they gonna do are they
869600	874080	gonna are they gonna are they gonna when someone's using less gas than the maximum amount to get
874080	879200	around you know they don't know what a loser it's cop humor they're connecting dots I would rather
879200	884720	my cops be linear thinkers really frankly I don't want them to be that creative with their guns and
884720	891680	their handcuffs I'd rather they just be like okay you're uh stealing that car which is illegal so
891680	897360	here's the your rights to remain silent I don't want them to be like hey I'm in my blue period
898080	907280	um okay uh the men in blue period but uh very impressively diverse multiracial uh
907280	912880	I'm always impressed when the LAPD shows up at my house and uh I like I like the diversity
913440	918640	it looks it looks like they they when you look at the LAPD when they come on in moss
919600	923840	it looks like the pamphlets it looks like a pamphlet it looks like a it's comforting
923840	927840	there's a woman systems working everything's fine I'll just go back in my house and uh
928480	933920	eat crackers and oppress the poor uh but and there's all and there are there that always
933920	938560	includes the diversity includes there's always incredibly handsome like uh young white dudes
938560	945760	like that look like they belong in a boy band very very very sexy uh white male cops uh among
945760	952720	among the the rainbow of justice get a room yeah but that was the guy that was busting the
952720	958640	balls the hardest uh yeah I don't it's an old story now so it's like almost feels like it's
958640	962880	like it's like wet graham crackers like telling it but that's what happened it's a big deal I
963040	966800	wish for this podcast it happened yesterday because it'd be all excited about it and explaining every
966800	973280	detail but uh a dude hit my garage and destroyed a water pipe so I got to stay in a hotel suite
973280	979680	it was fun I had a very good time in India with church we had a beautiful uh little excursion
979680	987040	out there that it's just it's like a mind-numbing mind-blowing like overwhelming explosion of
987040	994800	kaleidoscopic madness it's so fucking cool do you guys get any uh illnesses no I the only I felt
994800	1001760	like crap believing because you take these malaria pills I got really nauseous on it nauseated but
1001760	1005840	you're not supposed to drink alcohol with them and I did of course and so I felt like a bum
1005840	1009600	but when I got to India then I felt amazing the entire time just ate the best food in the world
1009600	1015200	then we came back and then we got sick just because we were traveling a lot yeah church
1015200	1021120	might have malaria church do you have malaria or are you surviving now last night you thought
1021120	1028880	you had malaria yeah we'll see uh I'm preoccupied by this thing I gotta I gotta get it done I've
1028880	1034240	had people telling me I've I've had a lot of advice don't talk about it you don't have to
1034240	1040640	talk about it it's done legal advice don't talk about it you open yourself up the most important
1040640	1050080	advice I've gotten is from women that I respect that do what I do that um that are respected
1051280	1057600	and that spoke to me privately and said uh you know if if you're true to your word and you are
1057600	1063200	sincere about how you want to be part of the solution not part of the problem um you know
1064240	1068560	please talk about how you've been part of the problem that's that's truly the most helpful
1068640	1074800	thing you can do um please appreciate if you're listening to me that the tightrope I have to walk
1074800	1082640	here is I have to I want to make this a normal part of the process because it should be healthy
1082640	1088880	and easy and graceful it should be it it should be a thing that can be done and doesn't have to
1088880	1096480	create civil war and hysteria um for that doesn't make people get re-victimized and attacked you're
1096480	1103760	not doing me any favors at all you're only hurting everybody especially me if this topic
1103760	1111280	causes you to attack anybody involved um you may think it's in my defense you may think it's in
1111280	1118880	defense of fairness I ask you to think about what you think fair is um that's enough disclaiming
1119680	1126720	I have I have I have really really had to think about you know this and uh
1129200	1132960	and decided I need to talk about it I don't I want you know I want to target about
1132960	1137440	what five to seven minutes and then and then pull me out of here
1138720	1143200	after which hopefully I've done some good by just uh talking about this this is about for your life
1143200	1152000	close them down right yes for your life recently closed down uh it it in in 2000 whatever whatever
1152000	1158480	I can't remember uh 2009 2006 2000 something something I had the privilege of running a
1158480	1170160	network sitcom and I uh I was attracted to a employee I really want to be careful about that
1170160	1177440	language I think a huge part of the problem is a culture of feeling things that you think are
1177440	1183760	unique and significant because they're happening to you and saying things like I had feelings for
1183760	1190640	and I it I fell for and all these things I mean the most clinical way I can put it infessing up to
1191200	1197680	my crimes is that I was attracted to a writer that I had power over because I was a showrunner
1197680	1209360	and I knew enough to know that these feelings were bad news that was easy enough to know
1210160	1214560	I knew that they ran the risk of undercutting people's faith in my judgment
1216720	1224000	her faith in her talent the other writers respect for me the entire production the audience
1224000	1229760	I knew that I wasn't doing anybody any favors by feeling these things
1232080	1236800	and so I did the cowardly easiest laziest thing you could do with feelings like that and I didn't
1236800	1243440	deal with them and in not dealing with them I made everybody else deal with them especially her
1243440	1255280	flirty creepy everything other than overt enough to constitute betraying your living
1255280	1261280	girlfriend to whom you're going home every night who is actually smart enough and respectful enough
1261280	1266720	to ask you do you have feelings for that young writer that you're talking about that you're
1266720	1273760	paying all this attention to and saying to her no because the trick is if you lie to yourself
1273760	1279680	you can lie to everybody it's really easy and so that's what I continued to do
1281760	1290880	telling myself and anybody that threatened to confront me with it that if you thought what I
1290880	1295840	was doing was creepy or flirty or unprofessional then it's because you were the sexist you were
1295840	1299520	jealous I was supporting this person I'm a mentor I'm a feminist
1303120	1308640	it's your problem not mine it's you're you're the one that actually is seeing things through that
1308640	1319760	lens and and so I let myself keep doing it and it's not as if this person didn't repeatedly
1319760	1326960	communicate to me the idea that what I was doing was divesting her of a recourse to integrity
1329040	1330480	I just didn't hear it
1332800	1339840	and it's because it didn't profit me to hear it and this was after all happening to me right
1340800	1353280	and so after a season of playing it that way I broke up with my girlfriend who I had lied to
1353280	1357680	the whole time while lying to myself lied to her about why I was breaking up with her
1359040	1363680	because I thought that would make having inappropriate feelings for a co-worker appropriate
1363680	1370400	if I wasn't involved I want you to be the one to examine this and every step of the way decide
1370400	1377200	for yourself where I'm making mistakes I don't want to explain to you what I've learned I want
1377200	1383760	you to look at this and I want it to sound relatively unremarkable to you because that's
1383840	1395200	the danger I broke up with my girlfriend then I went right you know full steam into creeping on
1395200	1403200	my employee now it was even less appropriate after all now I wasn't in danger of being a bad person
1403200	1414480	and then after that season you know I got overt about my feelings after it was wrapped because
1416240	1422640	and and said oh I I love you and and she said the same thing she'd been saying the entire time
1423520	1431360	in one language or another please don't you understand that focusing on me like this
1431360	1439040	liking me like this preferring me like this I can't say no to it and when you do it
1439600	1442720	it makes me unable to know whether I'm good at my job
1447520	1456240	and because I finally got to the point where I said to her oh this is you know I love you
1456240	1463520	because that's what I thought it was when you target somebody for two years
1465200	1469680	and it was therefore rejected that way I was humiliated
1473120	1479200	and so I continued to do the cowardly thing and continued to do the selfish thing
1479200	1490880	and now I wanted to teach her a lesson I wanted to show her that if she didn't like being liked
1490880	1495440	in that way then oh boy she should get over herself after all if you're just going to be a
1495440	1502960	writer then this is how just writers get treated and that was probably the darkest of it all I
1502960	1510800	I'm going to assume that when she tweets about it you know and refers to trauma that that's
1512160	1523520	probably it because I drank I took pills I crushed on her and resented her for not reciprocating it
1524400	1528480	and the entire time I was the one writing her paychecks and in control whether she stayed
1528560	1535680	or went and whether she felt good about herself or not and said horrible things
1537360	1543520	just treated her cruelly pointedly things that I would never ever ever have done if she had been
1543520	1551600	male and if I had never had those feelings for her and I lied to myself the entire time about it
1552320	1555920	and I lost my job I ruined my show
1559600	1567440	I betrayed the audience I destroyed everything and I damaged her internal compass
1571840	1575760	and I moved on and
1582160	1588640	I never did it before and I will never do it again but I certainly wouldn't have been able to do it
1588640	1596240	if I had any respect for women on a fundamental level I was thinking about them as different
1596240	1602640	creatures I was thinking about the ones that I liked as having some special role in my life
1602640	1612160	and I I did it all by not thinking about it so I just want to say in addition to obviously
1612160	1619520	being sorry but that's really not the important thing I want to say I did it by not thinking
1619520	1626720	about it and I got away with it by not thinking about it and if she hadn't mentioned something
1626720	1634640	on Twitter I would have continued to not have to think about it although I did walk around with
1634640	1643680	my stomach and not about it but I wouldn't have had to talk about it and the the last and most
1643680	1648800	important thing I can say is just think about it no matter who you are at work no matter where
1648800	1652560	you're working no matter what field you're in no matter what position you have over or under or
1652560	1658000	side by side with somebody just think about it you gotta because if you don't think about it
1658000	1663840	you're gonna get away with not thinking about it and you can cause a lot of damage that is
1663840	1674880	technically legal and hurts everybody and I think that we're living in a good time right now because
1675600	1682000	we're not gonna get away with it anymore and if we can make it a normal part of our culture
1682560	1688800	that we think about it and possibly talk about it then maybe we can get to a better place where
1688800	1697760	that stuff doesn't happen uh so that's it um please please don't hurt her um please don't
1698800	1707440	please don't please don't make this worse on anybody but me um and uh and let's move on
1707440	1714240	I'm bad at ending things I'm gonna now have a drink that was seven minutes exactly oh well
1715360	1722080	it was totally rehearsed Jeff tell us about India uh this is kind of a tough act to follow man
1722800	1727360	well India's certainly the means to do it you know it's amazing are there cows there
1727920	1734400	cows those are illegal right cows cows are not only legal they have their own lane the traffic
1734400	1738800	there is insane and I was told that it goes in order of the size of the car like the bigger cars
1738800	1743520	get the right of way and then all the way down to the people on scooters but if you're a cow
1743520	1748800	everybody gets out of your way they call it the cow lane and the cows just cruise down the street
1748800	1753520	they're kind of like cats they they like they hang out in a hurry they hang out in the daytime they
1753520	1758080	go they get galavant around town eating you know whatever they find on the street sometimes pilot
1758080	1762320	trash or whatever and then they all seem to be going home in the same direction at the end of
1762320	1767200	the day like they're all kind of coming coming back home their day job is like to eat garbage
1767200	1771360	you know it's crazy when when church and I checked in we got we landed at like 3am we got to the
1771360	1777120	hotel at like 4am and they this beautiful hotel in bungalow and they put the little I forget what
1777120	1781920	they call church with a little red blessing on your forehead talaka and they give you a little
1783520	1786880	a talaka and they they put the thing and they gave us a little mango drink
1786880	1790400	and there was christmas decorations everywhere because it was we got there like um
1790400	1796480	like around the 20th right something like that no no before that i think before yeah uh but it's
1796480	1801280	you know in the build up to christmas they love christmas too like like more christmas decorations
1801280	1806080	than you see here and everywhere like the malls and the hotel lobbies and the airports so it's
1806080	1810800	just like santa clausas and christmas trees everywhere and i asked this woman uh needy or
1810800	1816240	like kind of our driver handler like chaperone like do you guys you guys love christmas we
1816240	1823040	celebrate every holiday here like Hindu holidays are every day they have a thousand you know
1823040	1827200	festivals and stuff like we love all festivals i go do you celebrate all christian festivals
1827200	1832960	oh yes all of them and uh because because christmas is the festival of lights and gift giving
1832960	1836640	and they all dress up as santa claus and give each other gifts i go do you celebrate all like uh
1836640	1841280	islamic festivals too yes all of them too i go uh jewish festivals and she goes nah
1841600	1846880	uh but not because the anti-Semitism i think they're like no but those aren't as fun they're
1846880	1852720	not flashy certainly yeah but you should have said meh meh yeah you should i mean come on
1854000	1859440	you know what i found weird is that they treated us so well they gave us me and greg proups were
1859440	1865760	doing comedy shows there and we were surrounded by like a phalanx of security when we would do
1865760	1870640	these shows and like i'd walk to go to the bar and there'd just be seven or eight buff indian
1870640	1875360	dudes and black t-shirts just following you around everywhere and they're under strict orders
1875360	1880160	like don't let this guy out of your sight like we were like big hot shot bollywood stars like like
1880160	1884240	no i think you'll find that nobody really knows who i am here but it was great the people there
1884240	1889040	are fantastic they called you they called you sahib i didn't know that until after the fact
1889040	1894560	that i was i was jeff sahib i was i found out later on that that that was my my handle
1895520	1899280	was that a thing that was it was it a greg proups
1899280	1904560	gig yeah greg and i once in a while will get corporate like shows usually they're in houston
1904560	1910400	or ohio or you know like like you know like corporate gigs around america but he said hey
1910400	1915280	jeff we got this cushy gig for this alcohol company called black dog uh in india and they
1915280	1920400	just treated us like royalty it was fantastic it was really like it's not funny i don't have i
1920400	1926080	don't have like a hilarious joke about it but like um if you've not been the people that are
1926080	1931440	listening that have been to india or from india they know i hope like how special and really
1931440	1938160	like marvelous like there's so many people it's so crowded there's so much noise and color and
1938160	1944320	sights and smells and sounds and things but nobody's angry like everybody just was chilled out and
1944320	1950400	just relaxed and if you follow church on her instagram at cassandra church uh there's a picture
1950400	1959280	that she took when we were at uh was it charamara palace charma charmala charmahala something like
1959280	1966240	that tomorrow doop doo doo doop uh and she took a picture of these five women just sitting down
1966240	1972080	on their break and it was like it's like it's almost so captivating i don't know i i'm kind
1972160	1978160	of nerded out on india and i really really like would love to go back at any time i'm working
1978160	1985440	with a writer that was in eastern europe and he you can tell from the way he talks about it that
1985440	1989760	he really wants to just go there and live there forever sometimes you can feel that way and be
1989760	1993520	wrong like you'd go out there and find out you were totally wrong and you just have an infatuation
1993520	2000880	with a place like i felt that way about portland for a while but uh i don't know i wonder if
2000880	2007520	everybody has like a a city somewhere on the planet where they would be extra activated i
2007520	2015440	mean india is such a giant like it's almost its own continent and every city from what i've heard
2015440	2022080	is really different in lots of ways um it's there's you know a hundred thousand languages and all
2022080	2025760	all this different like just from neighborhood to neighborhood is so different i would love to go
2025760	2029120	back and explore more of it like some people go to thailand and fall in love with it and go okay
2029120	2034720	i could live i could live in thailand um i don't know that i would necessarily need to go live in
2034720	2038960	india but it's certainly a place like church has a friend who's a composer who they named michael
2038960	2044960	dana who like he he goes there like for months right yeah and like he's he's in love with india
2046160	2051840	and you and you can see why it's like just walking down the street old ladies wearing these
2051840	2057200	brilliantly colored saris or kurtis or whatever and just walking down the road church was dressed
2057200	2062480	you know like in a black vivian westward suit the first day and not not getting like hostile looks
2062480	2067360	but just kind of kind of getting side eyes from the ladies and then we got her some local gear
2067360	2073760	like you got some clothes there you want to come up and talk about it church come on up
2074560	2083920	let's not talk about her like she's not here
2093040	2096800	so these women like walking down the road and then she kind of put like some lineny like we got
2096800	2101280	some like local like kind of more local looking clothes and then women just started smiling at
2101520	2105600	her and then we're walking down like these like the old city and uh and hydro bad which is much
2105600	2111360	more islamic um like a lot of burkas and the full-on head covering stuff and little girls were just
2111360	2115280	coming up to church and just taking photos with her like she was like lady gaga it was fucking red
2115280	2121200	it was really good yeah they don't get a lot of um westerners coming to hit her bad there's it's
2121200	2128800	not really a tourist spot so we we stood out yeah i looked like Godzilla and she looked like
2128880	2134880	Yolandi from uh fucking dn word i mean you hear that you hear that a lot about thailand and
2136400	2141280	i didn't i wasn't sure if india was was like that but then again india is gigantic and so it
2141280	2146080	probably vary from neighborhood to neighborhood but that that i didn't know if that was also a
2146080	2152880	thing that was still happening in the 80s i would hear that that if you're an american or a european
2152880	2159440	and you're like uh and you go to some of these countries that the people everybody just wants to
2159440	2166720	like pose with you and touch your clothes and all this stuff and it it's the kind of thing that it
2166720	2176480	as a white american you you don't want to it feels racist like it also feels antiquated i
2176480	2181360	actually didn't expect that that would still be a thing now that like right i don't know post
2181360	2186400	internet or something anything now and most places are becoming more and more western i
2186400	2191920	really didn't expect to really feel so foreign yeah and that was a tech city these were tech
2191920	2196480	cities these are sort of not even the places that you see in most of the travel photos these
2196480	2201600	these are the progressive kind of areas it's possible that the reason we think that way and
2201600	2206480	then we think that it's wrong to think that way or whatever is that because we have a perverted
2206480	2214480	relationship with fame and with selfies and and we how we conflate it with social status so that
2214480	2221120	we have this like oh if you come up to somebody and say can i take a picture with you that you're
2221920	2226800	taking something from them slash giving them something and there's an exchange happening
2226800	2237440	whereas they as a more ancient founded culture like are just going you look crazy they just walk
2237440	2241920	up and say can i take a selfie with you yeah like and there's no shame at all in fact i noticed i
2241920	2245680	don't know if you noticed this did you see all the billboards advertising phones that take better
2245680	2250640	selfies and it's just on billboards everywhere specifically advertising phones based on having
2250640	2255520	good selfies you didn't notice that they were everywhere jeff was telling me about the head
2255520	2263680	wag thing and i'm not so fascinating that that there's this that i mean i don't know how else to
2263680	2270880	describe it it's like saying um and like while you're like you're saying hey um so if we're gonna
2270880	2277200	leave for the airport and while you're saying like the person they go and it's like that's
2277200	2282320	them cogitating it's an acknowledgement of what you're saying being processed so i was kind of
2282400	2287680	as opposed to just immediately babbling and saying um er well let me see i don't know which i would
2287680	2293680	imagine during that crucial phase a lot of us that's when a lot of us say no to each other
2293680	2299280	because we don't know what to do and hey do you know how to blah blah blah no no you know but then
2299280	2303120	maybe if we if we did have a thing in our culture where it's like well don't do that don't just
2303120	2310480	diarrhea some nose at each other don't feel the need to like barf up information actually if you
2310480	2317920	if you're on pause that's it it's like a little uh pinwheel thing and in an operating system
2317920	2323360	that someone's going like this well they heard me i think there's i think it means lots of different
2323360	2328480	things that i we weren't there long enough to totally like learn but like it's just you don't
2328480	2335200	see that that little chin wag thing like it felt like it made sense after about a day it was sort
2335200	2340480	of strange at first and then i kind of got just it's like when you're like trying to pick up a new
2340480	2345200	language and you start to learn things based on just like the context of what's happening yeah you
2345200	2350320	know like it's just body language and it's like oh well he's he's he's saying yeah like by the way
2350320	2354480	his eyes look i can tell it's like yeah maybe or like this other point is like oh yes absolutely
2354480	2364160	i can do that like here's something i noticed that sorry uh this is fucked up you know how
2364160	2370000	people think that on twitter that i wrote teen wolf on the mtv show right in india people kept
2370000	2375520	coming up to me and they go like at the hotel like we're these nice hotels and it's two waitresses
2375520	2381840	come up to me i'm having breakfast and they go uh like part of me um mr davis uh jeff davis
2381840	2386240	yeah they go we have such big fans of yours and there's a lot of who's line fans there like they
2386240	2390240	it's been syndicated there for ages so a lot of people really know who's line which is why they
2390240	2394960	brought us out there i suppose um there everyone thinks i'm jeff the same jeff davis the routine
2394960	2400240	with it but for for their money they're giant criminal minds fans and everybody thought i was
2400240	2404400	the jeff davis they wrote criminal minds because that's the same jeff davis oh okay we gotta get
2404400	2408960	this guy in the show it shouldn't be yeah i don't want to insult him by saying it shouldn't be that
2408960	2414720	hard but i'm just assuming if he works in la and his name's jeff davis we were doing he must want
2414720	2418640	to talk about this we did a show in bungalow greg and i were doing it then we're doing it like a
2418640	2422000	photo op meet and greet like people like you know come up and take photos and stuff like that
2422000	2427360	with the backdrop and the whole you know paparazzi kind of flim flam and security and stuff and these
2427360	2433600	these guys that look like straight up harmontown age harmontown nerdy looking fans they come up
2433600	2437440	they're like oh we have big fans of yours big fans of yours like oh thank you you like the show
2437440	2443120	like we love the show criminal minds the best show in the world but they just saw me perform
2443120	2447120	improv and they still think that i'm the jeff davis from criminal minds well i yeah i mean
2447120	2452880	that's to live in their world where you're like yeah i'm creating criminal minds and teen wolf and
2452880	2458240	then fuck it let's play let's play emotional party as a sideline i tell dick jokes but i'm not
2458240	2462720	making a show right wait let me what's criminal minds again i don't know i think padgett bruister
2462720	2467920	was on it at some point no is that wait really i don't i think i don't know i've never seen that
2467920	2473120	or teen wolf i don't know i just know that i told you about the my accountant calling me up and
2473120	2478800	saying that uh did you spend five thousand dollars on limousines last night no i got billed for the
2478800	2484800	other jeff davis's limo rides to the emmys or something like that oh man it's like when they
2484800	2490800	come up with tv show names are they trying are they is part of it like well we want it to sound
2490800	2499040	like other shows because that's part of the appeal of tv if it sounds too much like a bus
2499760	2507120	people won't know they should watch it so let's call it tv show but we'll just technically change
2507120	2512480	the title so that you can find it i think especially for procedurals and stuff that's
2512480	2517360	absolutely a huge like there's always nyp or i don't know it's like then there is chicago and
2517360	2523360	chicago fire and it's like they're they're trying to just cash on the it's just it's just these words
2523440	2529920	that are like things you like right television it makes sense i in an ideal culture you would you
2529920	2536160	you could call it anything you could call it gadzookamooka colon a crime procedural right you
2536160	2542480	know and then people would go oh gadzookamooka at least i can remember that hey who's who's
2542480	2547520	forgetting it whatever if you're into that what's the uh what's the elevator pitch for a gadzookamooka
2547520	2554720	that's just it's just uh seven uh experts from uh different fields uh forced to work in a task
2554720	2563520	force uh in downtown cincinnati uh due to a uh the uh the the the recent string of abductions
2563520	2567280	and then i have to get to the season if you watch it then i think you know at the end of it they're
2567280	2572080	like they're like well i guess that's it they got all the boxes uh packed up and the sets are you
2572080	2576320	know the bulletin boards are emptied and then the and then the guy comes out from the office and
2576320	2584240	goes like not so fast jackasses a homeless guy just got eaten by a Loch Ness Monster in scotland
2592640	2599840	cincinnati's being overrun by Loch Ness Monsters uh yeah i wonder what it would take to write
2599840	2605360	a procedural i guess i guess a healthy dose of watching procedurals yeah that seems like
2605360	2611040	everybody yeah i think i think you have to like have someone like a consulting producer that used
2611040	2614640	to work on one of those things that knows all the let's test that let's see if we could just
2614640	2619520	improvise a procedural just just as a radio play we don't have to act it out okay let's
2619520	2622880	i'm not as familiar with them as you are i don't really watch them and i'll do i think you could
2622880	2630800	take my lead yeah i'm like uh uh uh marty mcfly saying to the band watch me for the changes to
2630800	2637760	try to keep up all right so uh you know the cold open i think we could put a pin in but let's just
2637760	2645120	say it's like a paper plate uh factory and uh guys finishing making a paper plates and he goes like
2645120	2656000	i'm all done here this off-screen voice says are you yeah there's more in here though in here where
2656000	2662400	it's dark and not surveilled and then he then he walks into the back room and you don't even hear
2662400	2673920	what happens but i gotta admit i i didn't expect this guy to be the victim but okay but but if we
2673920	2678800	don't see what happened all right well do we hear a sound like a silencer that you it goes to silent
2678800	2686080	like it kind of sounds then we cut to a woman in bed and she's looking it's like she's nervously
2686080	2690400	sleeping and reaches over and there's nobody there and she sees the clock and it's 2 30 a.m
2690960	2697920	and she picks up her phone and starts calling somebody but but a cold open we're gonna need
2697920	2703360	to we're gonna need to punch this thing like we want it to we want to blow to our cold open and
2703360	2707520	it can't be a guy walking in the darkness and it can't be a lady checking her but she's like where
2708480	2712320	you know now he's disappeared now where is he that's the assumption we're making right so now
2712320	2717840	he's disappeared at the paper plate factory he was supposed to be home hours ago so then cut to her
2718560	2722960	because it's a cold over we gotta keep it short so now but now doesn't the story change into her
2722960	2730720	finding her yeah so she cut to her pulling up like and let's just save money and she cut to her
2730720	2736000	at the same set where he was yeah is that she's wearing a fur coat and whatever she threw on
2736080	2742000	a fur coat because that's the paper plate money the rich wife of a paper plate factory worker
2742000	2746320	well i think that's a clue it's a gift okay i don't want to blow the whole plot but i think
2746320	2752080	that's going to be a thing right and so she's and she's why and then she she walks into that
2752080	2757440	back room that spencer described and then she turns on a light and the camera kind of
2757440	2764240	ghostbusters on her and she goes oh okay so then you can go to your title sequence csi and it's like
2764240	2771040	crime conspiracies international no that's wrong that's catzookamooka sorry sorry sorry
2771040	2777760	catzookamooka which is the name of the plate company oh oh it's center it's a serious centered
2777760	2784640	around the intrigue of the plate company all right okay yeah all right catzookamooka plates
2784640	2793200	you know what and the billboards for the show say you know what uh uh now serving murder
2795200	2802320	as murder serves three come back for seconds degrees murder the plates are disposable
2802320	2811600	but the crimes last forever kind of thing like heartache is i don't want to keep developing
2811600	2817440	this show only not not because i don't believe in it because i'm i'm starting to get greedy right
2817440	2821680	yeah i want to pitch it know about this i have a first look with the effects i don't want to
2821680	2827840	waste tuka-muka plates i mean i i think it's this is probably like a six episode netflix-y
2827840	2833200	kind of thing right i mean yeah like spotlight yeah which was a six well if it's if it's on
2833200	2838960	netflix well let's not develop it let's just make it a 10-hour story chop it into six parts and go
2838960	2849120	home uh oh wow shots fired that's grander shots fired most successful tv venue i warmed up to
2849120	2855840	mine hunter but it couldn't use more paper plates there are mine hunters in criminal minds i think
2855840	2862240	yeah like i think most of the show is a bunch of mine what what what did the golden globes uh go
2862240	2870080	off with uh without a hitch oh my god i am still recovering after that oprah speech that's all i'm
2870080	2875760	seeing on instagram is people posting pictures of oprah just the most generic things about it too
2875760	2880720	just like you had to have been either very impressive or very not impressive did she go
2880720	2886320	there or did she not go there she might think she went there she gave everyone a car the disappointing
2886320	2891200	thing was that'd be amazing she literally gave everyone a car not just the people at the golden
2891200	2896480	globes just everyone all of us we all get a car as a measure of her actual wealth that we're
2896480	2902480	sitting here snarking her and then we go home and we have a car and then and and yeah it's in your
2902480	2907040	it's in your busted garage right now next to the segue i'm the only one that doesn't have a car
2907040	2912720	because my uh my my garage door is busted so everyone took my car is the segue still down
2912720	2917680	there did you you you removed it no segue never existed yeah it was uh it was a trickle i was
2917680	2923600	cooler than that the segue you missed an opportunity in that photo that you you and cody both posted
2923600	2928720	photos of it i think and you what you do the way you get away with you having an embarrassing segue
2928720	2933680	in your garage if you say that that's the that's what the drunk driver was on i know i he drove the
2933680	2938080	segue through your drive through your garage he kept going until he hit the back wall i figured
2938080	2942240	that out after you said it and i i mean bonus points for actually taking the segue and placing
2942240	2948080	it at the point of impact do you think that would be too much or just tipped over sideways with a
2948080	2953840	couple of miracles put a chalk line that's that's shaped like a segue in front of the garage speaking
2953840	2961920	of hollywood gossip uh how i don't want to get you guys in trouble because of your personal
2961920	2968320	relationships can i just say i was at a party there was a birthday party of a famous musician
2968320	2974240	yeah can we talk about this or can we not talk about this i all i want to say is i'll let me
2974240	2978400	vet this with you and you tell me if i can say it okay i just want to say that johnnie depp was
2978400	2986240	at the party and i think he was literally wearing a hat on a hat i can confirm this he was literally
2986240	2992320	he had a lot of it was like a beanie on a beanie he was wearing all of the costumes from the last
2992320	2999600	eight pirates movies at the same time he had a lot of shit on him i couldn't believe it yeah he
2999600	3004400	was i'm so celebrity blind i didn't know that i was standing next to courtney left for 10 minutes
3004960	3009840	and until somebody pointed out that it was courtney let us in and then she really gave me the heebie
3009840	3015680	jeebies just in the just in the vein of of harmless gossip i'm not i'm not going to cross
3015680	3020240	the threshold into defamation or anything like that i think she'd be happy to hear this me
3020240	3026880	gossiping about this i but at the same time it's not it's it's totally shallow crap that's just
3026880	3032960	star fuckery like i was at a party and courtney love was there but i was it was noteworthy to me
3033760	3042000	i was like wow she's i uh i she looks uh healthy she looks great yeah that's all i wanted to say
3042000	3046000	she looks better than she did 10 years ago it takes something it takes on a new tone now because
3046000	3049440	you're like oh you're not supposed to judge people objectifying about stuff but courtney
3049440	3052400	love i think is a special case because it's like well she's courtney love she was sort of like a
3052400	3059040	tarot card for like she was the american uh uh what i don't know we always have these like
3059040	3063520	archetypes that we sell we go like oh she's crazy she's doing she's drunk yeah she's had
3063520	3070400	her ups and downs but for somebody who's who's who had that that archetype and that i that power
3070400	3076960	she was like yeah she she looked very healthy what who cares about my opinion about who looks
3076960	3081200	healthy i think that gets into character i find that being accused murderous takes a lot of years
3081200	3087840	off what what did you say being accused oh okay i didn't i didn't mean to make you repeat it i
3089440	3092240	what's the deal with that can we talk about charles pleasure though now let's talk about
3092240	3097600	courtney love's uh involvement in curcobain's death well i think if we talk about that and
3097600	3101600	then talk about charles pleasure we'll we'll definitely never be invited to any parties ever
3101600	3107200	again that'll be the only result charles pleasure the voice of rod your rabbit but it is important
3107200	3111760	to say charles pleasure has become physically specific he's become a mythical creature what
3111760	3117200	happened with charles pleasure uh that is uh that's a question for god to answer you guys
3117280	3123280	listen to skull juice is that what you're talking about no no but if you if you have not heard the
3123280	3127120	skull juice episode with dino stamatopoulos and andy dick or charles pleasure it's a must
3127120	3133360	is momentarily a guest it's arguably only listen dino throws him off the show kind of or no he just
3133360	3138640	drives him off the show it was it was it's the best episode it's the only listen uh episode you
3138640	3142400	gotta listen to the school i think it's the best episode of a podcast it might be it was amazing
3142400	3146800	it was certainly like this belongs in the museum you don't have to love or hate roger rabbit or
3146800	3151520	no dino or andy dick or give a shit about podcasts to love this episode because
3152400	3158320	the amount of conflict that happens in the first four minutes is outrageous yeah i mean charles
3158320	3161520	like it was just kind of haunting the party and then when the cake came out he just wanted to
3161520	3166000	eat all the cake do you think it's okay to talk about just the one thing that i think that the
3166000	3170720	listeners would be interested in without we don't have to talk about whose house the party was at
3170720	3176960	but just the interesting fact that about how the party kind of uh went off the rails is that do you
3176960	3184240	think that's too yeah well out of bounds let me tell it then carefully because i don't want anybody
3184240	3190000	to get upset because i did do some looking and thankfully it didn't seem to like explode online
3190000	3195360	or anything and there hasn't been any gossip so i don't want it to start here but someone made the
3195360	3201040	mistake as anyone who's ever been to a hollywood party which i'm sure is all of these listeners
3201040	3207280	knows yeah you're not supposed to say where you're at and it's pretty tight and you don't want like
3208320	3214000	um anybody just showing up to like a house party or whatever when you have when you have johnny dapp
3214000	3218080	there or whatever like yeah if you don't put the address on facebook i didn't know that you were
3218080	3221280	you and cody are going to be there i was blown away that you and cody and just couldn't believe
3221280	3229680	you didn't belong there who like this this rabble and already like it was a little bit too loose of
3229680	3234400	a guest list like once we came in the owner of the house was not too pleased with just how many
3234400	3239200	people were in his house he wasn't quite prepared for that but someone had the bright idea to like
3239200	3246000	i don't know if they deliberately posted it on instagram or if they like location tagged where
3246000	3253760	they were without thinking or something but somehow the address got out and like like teenagers
3253760	3260880	started showing up like young young man fans of it like it was just like they were pounding on
3261680	3267920	the gates and there had been like um we can say we can say it was stings logan paul it was stings
3268560	3275760	house we can talk about this it was steve's place no stings house it's the phrase stings house is
3275760	3282480	already funny like i i never imagined him living in a house i would imagine him living in a uh nest
3283920	3290320	it's like a like under the aurora borealis it was it was a nice tree house it was the biggest tree
3290320	3297680	house party i've ever been to a sting sting lives in an igloo uh that's inside of a yurt yeah
3297680	3304720	he has a yeah inside is yoga sweat lodge he's a igloo he lives yeah he lives in a igloo inside
3304720	3310400	a yurt and the and all of his appliances are powered by the temperature differential between
3310400	3318800	the uh yurt and the igloo it's a yurt compound connected with hammocks it has a half life of
3318800	3325200	700 years and two orgasms all of the all of the electricity is powered by his own self-interest
3326240	3330960	i mean we don't okay we can't punish sting for our interest in him sting's the worst
3330960	3336160	all right you were at his house we weren't we weren't really at stings house for the purposes
3336160	3341040	of this story we're just going to keep pretending let's just say it was stings so sorry if anybody
3341040	3345040	thought that we were at stings house so i we got derailed just because the phrase stings house was
3345040	3348800	really entertaining me but we could basically the end of the story is is that there was property
3348800	3353680	damage because someone leaked the location of this party and these kids broke like the front
3353680	3359040	gate and the back gate we're talking about stealing and it ended up in this everybody out
3359040	3366240	scenario that sent the kids who were trying to break in with the party guests including courtney
3366240	3372480	love and anybody else who was like some hot shot out on the street at the exact same moment all
3372560	3376560	trying to get cars at the same time and that's kind of fun for the kids to know that if you're
3376560	3382160	at a hollywood party and shit goes sideways enough you will get shoved into the street
3382160	3387440	with famous people yeah now it's going to be the goal right like after this you and cody had left
3387440	3392720	before the the the fur hit the fire right before um then things got crazy and everyone's being
3392720	3399280	yelled at and the guy who threw the party was mad at the the birthday uh person and but we found out
3399280	3403600	i thought johnny depp got thrown out with us because we all got thrown out we all made our way
3403600	3408880	out the door at the same time johnny depp was apparently there at 330 no he's cleaning around
3408880	3413360	cleaning up he whoa he apparently went to work that's all right man it's all right and used one
3413360	3420240	of his 9 000 scarves to wipe down the kitchen counter and while the birthday boy was being
3420240	3426880	bitched out by the host and and being surly and you know perpetuate on the couch johnny depp was
3426880	3431360	up there like cleaning up cups and fucking wiping down the fucking shit and like he was being like
3431360	3436160	like the men oh he was the good friend who stuck around and tried to make it better like a hefty
3436160	3442080	bag like red solo cups it's cool no no no johnny you don't have to do it no it's all right man
3442080	3449120	it's all right man anything else anything i can do to help man but he and kourtney sang a song
3449120	3453680	together and i gotta say johnny never sang but yeah he played guitar he played guitar and kourtney
3453920	3459040	it was not that good i was disappointed oh come on it was like a little it was like a little
3459040	3463680	impromptu like living room set what was that the song the music or the the lyrics i don't know i
3463680	3470400	just at some point the party i want to know who's worse at singing or guitar i don't know come on
3470400	3478080	so anyway i'm fucking sting and i mean and i mean fucking him and sting is still he's still coming
3478160	3487680	he's i made him come for the first time since uh since quadraphonia uh yeah well so we'll find
3487680	3495920	out what oprah did and uh i don't think she did something encouraging joe parry from erosmith is
3495920	3498880	walking around a bunch and i was very excited about that i wanted to meet him and he looked
3498880	3503520	i was too afraid how thoroughly effective i didn't quite cody sent me a link so i could
3503520	3509840	try to understand the context but i was preoccupied the all-black thing what was the
3511200	3517600	that was an amber tamblyn spearheaded thing and what what was the definition of it it was
3518400	3523360	if you're a woman and you're going to the gold golden gloves wear wear all black is that it
3523360	3529360	it was i saw something about this that was about showing solidarity for women in the workplace
3529360	3534400	at the golden clubs by wearing all black because i was and i did the article i i feel
3534400	3540160	embarrassed saying i skim like i barely read it but it was it was because i was preoccupied but
3540720	3550080	but uh it's something you know it was rooted in a narrative about the culture of like super slim
3550080	3555280	dresses and worrying about your weight and all this stuff but i didn't quite understand i didn't
3555280	3561200	make the connection from from zooming through the thing why if if let's wear all black really
3561200	3566560	just meant let's just let's just wear whatever and not worry about like jamming ourselves into
3566560	3576240	a sequined uh i have no idea if if it had oh oh oh she didn't spearhead it okay sorry that was cody
3576960	3581280	cody do you know do you know a lot about this cody's so high i'm fucking mexican right now
3581280	3585520	she can't even cody we're gonna have cody won't come up here yeah she's she's she's tripping balls

3590720	3596640	so comfy over there this article associates the all black wearing thing with the times up movement
3596640	3605280	which just went public recently yeah so that's like a coalition of women in the industry that
3605360	3612320	are coming together times up is shannon doherty me too is ros bego and and uh i've had it is uh

3869200	3875760	more make a thousand more make a million more keep asking me to come to the theater door i'm
3875760	3881440	gonna camp outside on the sidewalk all night i'm gonna get into a horrible night fight with other
3881440	3887920	nerds about whether we should wait longer or who cut in line and meanwhile the country is crumbling
3887920	3900640	well i am mumbling about enamel pins with princess leah's cg face on them star wars
3900640	3910800	when they gonna fight those star wars i'm a star war rapper you won the battle the star battle but
3910800	3923360	not the star war oh thank you
3926720	3937760	darth darth gaga the the newest sith lord with a lightsaber that has two blades coming out of the
3937760	3946960	handle and uh of course little tiny lightsaber hand guards coming out of the hilt um what could
3946960	3956560	be cooler and smarter and sexier than that a lightsaber with uh fucking little baby lightsabers
3956560	3963040	that come out in case someone tries to do that move where they slide their lightsaber down yours
3963040	3969280	and cut your fingers you'd be like psych it's it's no it's like yeah it makes sense you know
3969280	3975600	you buy a big book of swords and you uh get out your sketchbook and you design new lightsabers
3975600	3983120	because that's that's where we needed to innovate is uh nothing was really working about the
3983120	3990080	lightsaber really i mean what was it a stick with a laser that stood still coming out of it
3990080	3996160	oh jeez let's reboot that i mean people are probably sick of that shit and after all really
3996160	4000560	didn't the person that designed the original lightsaber weren't they really working within
4000560	4008480	limitations i mean weren't they weren't they defined by them there was no imagination happening
4008480	4016160	in the original star wars it's not like now that you have computer technology you should just go
4016160	4021760	okay that shit is designed how it's designed it happened a long long time ago in a fucking
4021760	4026800	galaxy far far away so why would you upgrade the goddamn fucking why why would you have a
4027840	4035200	lightsaber with two blades i i want to fart on your shit and eat it have you considered
4037760	4040560	have you considered that it's actually extremely badass
4040560	4049040	to be fair you have to have a high iq to like the new star wars but the technology improved
4050000	4056000	in prequels well it's hard to argue that it kind of went back in time getting better lightsabers
4056000	4061200	it's extremely badass can you imagine the ultimate insult of you taking a shit and somebody walking
4061200	4069520	over and farting on your shit are they eating it oh sorry um it's me oh it's me uh the star trek
4069520	4079680	rapper we should also revisit that franchise a thousand times uh you know what we should
4079680	4088960	really generally do is only make things that have already been made it makes sense everybody knows
4088960	4096480	that it's this new sustainability um it's recycling do you think have the star wars
4096480	4101680	and star trek rapper has ever collaborated together was there ever a song that we got together
4101680	4106000	i'm already exhausting myself and i can already feel like why am i trying to get people to hate me
4107680	4111280	yeah oh hey it's don't forget me the blade runner rapper
4112480	4120400	yo blade runner blade runner 2049 yo yo a blade runner reebo reebo reebo

4140000	4146400	and then make him poster and put him on the poster yo it's a brilliant movie you're not allowed to
4146400	4153200	hate it because they used vangelis in the soundtrack totally fucking up so it's citizen

4212000	4226320	screener don't be mad don't be meaner suck my dick it fucking it was boring why why would i
4226320	4232320	care about your hologram girlfriend you didn't hack the circuitry she's not special she's not
4232400	4238560	johnny five she's a fucking hologram she's not alive so you she gets stepped on at the end i
4238560	4245680	don't fucking care it doesn't send me into fucking any kind of arc because she never existed she's a
4245680	4253440	fart she's a cloud he's a fucking robot none of it matters nothing matters the whole movie didn't
4253440	4259120	matter nothing happened that mattered the movie didn't matter by the way the one thing that mattered
4259200	4265680	is the idea that robots were making babies and it was never explained what the fuck
4267520	4277200	robot babies the robots are making babies all right so they're not robots then
4278480	4285040	who cares robots are made of metal and can run through walls and if you shoot them they don't
4285040	4291200	fall down as quickly they're like zombies that way that's what makes them cool and you can tell
4291200	4296560	convicting stories about what it's like to be something that's not human like frankenstein
4296560	4303760	or the original blade runner but then if you make a movie based on a movie that you liked you run
4303760	4311760	the risk of making a xerox of a xerox of a phantom of a thought and you might be just stupid and
4311760	4321600	pretending to be smart blade runner sucked blade runner sucked giving a million awards i don't
4321600	4327120	care kick me out of hollywood put me in prison it fucking sucked if i have to pretend blade
4327120	4336240	runner was good in order to keep working here i will kill myself sorry blade runner sucked
4337200	4344480	you know it was pretty good i tanya was good it was a movie about a figure skater
4346320	4348640	sorry i tanya was pretty fun
4351840	4356240	but you know that means i'm getting old i'm getting old you know but i don't but i don't
4356240	4363680	think 18 year olds liked blade runner 2092 or whatever it is i i i think you're i think if you're
4363760	4367680	i think it's people my age that were like whoa blade runner was awesome because we
4367680	4372960	because and i understand the emotional concept that you were terrified that they were gonna
4372960	4376000	fuck up blade runner the way they fucked up robocop the way they fucked up everything
4376000	4380000	that we've gotten so scared that they're gonna fuck everything up that you were relieved that
4380000	4391040	it wasn't fucked up but not fucked up doesn't mean good good you know yeah like if you don't
4391040	4397440	believe that they call a lift and and and have your driver be either fucked up or not fucked up
4397440	4403040	and do you want to drive you home we had a lift with a dog in it the other day a little puppy
4403040	4406720	named phoenix that's in the front seat and she just jumped in the back seat what doesn't
4407280	4410800	laid in our laps and wanted tum tum rubs and it was the best thing in the world
4411760	4416000	that was the best lift ever although i couldn't help but think you know what if you were allergic
4416000	4420320	and you'd gotten to that lift you just it would be a nightmare i walked in i was already happy
4420320	4425920	because i looked i said phoenix a little puppy was in the front seat i didn't see the dog i saw
4425920	4433360	a nice brand new lint roller in the little mesh you know seat pouch you know thing seat back thing
4433360	4436960	oh that's nice he has a lint roller and then you find out why because there's a little little
4436960	4442720	head pops around the corner and a little dummy in it aww phoenix phoenix seemed to be trained too
4442720	4448640	this seemed to be a thing phoenix knew to wait for the signal that the people in the back seat
4448640	4454400	wanted phoenix in the back seat and then jumped back there and then knew when our ride was over
4454400	4458240	went in the front seat and hopped back into the front seat knew it when the car came to a stop
4458240	4462480	and the thing like you have arrived at your destination and phoenix got out of our way so
4462480	4470960	we could you know get out and do our thing it was adorable he's got it yeah baby he's got it
4471840	4478240	i'm your phoenix uber phoenix uh what what time i can't
4480160	4484800	let's get some levy up here steve levy okay come join us leave it but i'm warning you now
4486960	4497840	yeah haircut leave it he's got a haircut leave it what's up steve were you in miami no i don't know
4497840	4505280	i went to school there yeah how was your holidays uh did you travel i think you did right yeah i went
4505280	4513280	home it was not good you almost died you said i did yeah it was it was hard it was a it was a hard
4513280	4519920	week for me just weather wise or emotionally i was freezing i mean i got i got sick so i was
4519920	4525840	bedridden for like three or four days and the first morning i was sick i woke up and i couldn't
4525840	4532240	move my arm couldn't move it more than this and it was really painful for five dollars a month
4532240	4535040	you can subscribe to harmontown and see how much his arm could move
4537680	4543760	and and i couldn't sleep because every little movement hurt my arm it was just so painful what
4543760	4548560	happened to your arm well i thought like oh this will get better and i was just in bed for a couple
4548560	4554720	days i was getting over this cold whatever it was um so you thought maybe you slept on it yeah yeah
4554720	4558480	i thought like yeah like lost circulation or something and then my mom was like you have to
4558480	4563520	go to the doctor and we go to this old jewish doctor and he's cracking all these jokes and
4563520	4568080	i was just in a lot of pain he's like we gotta x-ray this thing well that was that's not a joke
4568080	4574240	that's the thing doctors say no yeah well did he say we have uh we have bad news and we have
4574240	4580880	worse news he well he he took the x-ray chart put it on the light thing and circled this
4580880	4588800	thing in my shoulder and he was just like sorry this you're way too young to be getting
4588800	4595360	this it's ultra rare for anyone your age to really get this i i don't know what what to tell you but
4595360	4604000	you have a um a calcium deposit in your rotator cuff oh no for real yeah and is this part of the
4604000	4612800	joke no okay and uh calcium is good for you well yeah but i don't know when it deposits
4612800	4621600	i don't think it's yeah i don't think it's related um but he was just like essentially the tissue
4621600	4628000	cells and the calcium cells are very very close so your body like when it was making
4628720	4635280	tissue cell it ended up being calcium cell which is essentially like bone it's like you know it's
4635280	4642400	like a physical it's a like a thing that grew in my shoulder i mean all cells are tissue cells
4642400	4646160	there's no there's no there's no actual thing called tissue in your body i mean everything's
4646160	4651680	tissue what i you know he was trying to simplify it okay i guess but uh so like when i was moving
4651680	4657200	there's like just like this like so now there's bone there interfering with the like rotation
4658160	4663440	and my well how are you moving your arm now well so what he did was he was like okay this
4663440	4669760	is gonna really suck for you oh no so sorry about this god let's pinpoint where your pain is oh no
4669760	4674640	and he was like pushing on certain areas he's like oh okay here's the area and he takes out
4674640	4683760	this giant needle and he goes okay i like on the count of three i guess this is gonna it's gonna
4683760	4691200	be terrible smash it and what he did what he did was he he went like this what what is he doing is
4691200	4696400	it an ice pick no it's a needle and the way he's using the calcium deposit and he just keeps
4696400	4701520	breaks in and out like this to break it apart like he's mashing potatoes yeah and then he's
4701520	4707280	moving it around like this scraping it out of your rotator cuff this happened for like a minute
4707280	4711760	and 30 seconds and it didn't give you anything before he fucking did that it was the weirdest
4711760	4715360	sensation did he give you a belt to bite or something like a stick i was biting my lip it
4715360	4720160	actually it really hurt and you could feel like hitting stuff in there no and he's like and then
4720160	4726320	he and then are you sure he was a doctor yeah and then he injected cortisone which is what they give
4726320	4732080	like the athletes yeah injured and he was like all right man but i know i know that really when
4732080	4738000	did he give you the cortisone it like intermittently wall okay through the stabbing it was a needle
4738000	4744720	full of cortisone that he squirted out well well yeah oh my god but he uses it as an ice pick
4744720	4749120	yeah yeah to break apart it sounds like did he say hold on i got an idea before he started doing
4749120	4754720	this doesn't sound like a procedure that's legitimate i'd like to see his diploma yeah
4754720	4759120	so anyway he was jeff he was jewish he was like you would think he was like you would
4759120	4763440	think the worst part is over and i think it is but it's only going to get worse before it gets
4763440	4768240	better oh no what so he's like the next two days are really gonna suck what what fuck fuck and he's
4768240	4772880	like it's gonna you probably won't be able to move it as much and uh you'll experience a lot more
4772880	4777360	pain and then hopefully over the next couple days you'll get some movement back and it'll be less
4777360	4783920	tight and you know like i get it's still tight but and it doesn't and not in a millennial way it's
4783920	4789840	not tight like it's like lit not like cool yeah it's not so sick it's no so then i was bedridden
4789840	4798000	all that day and and then the next day my mom was like will you come out to dinner with us it's
4798000	4802160	my boyfriend's 60th birthday and it's the doctor no
4805200	4808480	and and and his daughter's gonna come and i was like it'll be a nice thing i was like okay fine
4808480	4815520	so we go to dinner and like halfway through the meal we're eating and took a bite of this piece
4815520	4821840	of steak and it's saturday night we're this like popular restaurant and it's like it's not going
4821840	4827280	down right you know and i was like this is this is not feeling good it starts to burn a little bit
4827280	4833520	so i drank a bunch of water and then i couldn't breathe i couldn't breathe at all like it was it
4833520	4839440	was really bad and i was like in my head everyone's looking at me like are you okay as i'm like
4839440	4844480	struggling but when you when you're really choking you can't even make a sound so people
4844480	4848720	are just like looking at you like what like they're looking and i was just like in my head
4848720	4856160	i was like okay there's a 50 chance i could clear this on my own and i and i i kind of wanted to
4856160	4860320	but it was like why why are you doing this just take the easy way out they're saying are you okay
4861440	4865920	do that you're supposed to do the yeah i was like i have to give the universal symbol for
4867280	4872160	did you do it yeah so what happened i went like this and and then my mom was like oh my god and
4872480	4877840	everyone just her boyfriend was just like do you need the heimlich maneuver and i was like
4877840	4883440	yes and so i had to stand up in the middle of this restaurant the all of the air just got sucked out
4883440	4887040	of the restaurant everyone stopped what they were doing all the tables were looking at me i was so
4887040	4891680	fucking embarrassed all the waiters like oh my god oh my god and then my mom's boyfriend
4892560	4897840	gave me the heimlich maneuver which wasn't painful at all i thought it would be maybe it
4897840	4903840	was the adrenaline but like for 15 seconds and then i just started like regurgitating all this
4903840	4909760	water onto my plate on the table into the middle of the restaurant everyone's looking at me i'm just
4909760	4915280	so fucking embarrassed please tell me it was like an olive garden or something no no it's like a
4915280	4921280	really what was it why did we spend this podcast talking about my harassment of employees what
4921280	4926640	this is the i had a it was this should have been the lead story it was a really bad uh
4926640	4932880	jesus you know is that why it took so long for you to get on uh fixing my garage i'm kidding god damn
4932880	4939120	well okay so i'm a bad boss so then so then uh so then that happens and since you were chucking on
4939120	4942720	the steak or no yeah it was a piece of steak it wasn't going down right i was like having a hard
4942720	4946880	time breathing so it's unrelated to the cortisone and the shoulder stab no this is a separate thing
4947840	4955280	i got sick for four days i yeah my arm broke down and then i almost died well it could be
4955280	4960960	i guess a cortisone could like maybe constrict your throat or something it was it was it was so
4960960	4966080	weird to not be able to breathe like it it was it was like simulated drowning like it's happened
4966080	4970240	it's happened to probably a lot of people there's like a burning here and then it was a cool
4970240	4976000	sensation because there was water on top and you just like no there's no that moment where you
4976000	4981760	realize it was you can't do anything about it that it's like actually happening and then the
4981760	4986160	weirdest thing we've talked about it on this podcast it's like the strangest thing happens
4986720	4991200	that you you get ashamed of it you don't want it to be happening so you want it you
4991200	4995360	kind of have an instinct to like get out of there and go die in an alley most choking victims die
4995360	4999760	in the bathroom alone they they get up they get up and go to the ladies room or the men's room and
5000480	5006560	actually almost have the perils of like living alone um i woke up i was telling leevee outside
5006560	5011200	because he was telling me that he almost died fried choking a few years ago i went to a chinese
5011200	5017360	restaurant that i always go to in chinatown and ordered the same thing i always do the duck and
5018080	5024960	it was bad duck evidently because i woke up at like four in the morning with food poisoning
5024960	5031440	and couldn't stop vomiting like projectile vomiting to the point where it blocked my nasal
5031440	5038080	cavities so the nasal cavities get blocked with vomit and then i'm continuing to vomit without
5038080	5042960	being able to stop right and i couldn't take a breath right and i'm thinking the whole time i'm
5042960	5047120	like isn't this what they tell you about how you can choke on your own vomit isn't this how this
5047120	5050320	must be what it's like when people die and how many days is it going to be before someone finds me
5050400	5055040	and i'm like thinking all of this before finally like something happens in like one nostril gets
5055040	5061680	just the tiniest bit of air that i'm able to then go like and i'm still vomiting but now it's just
5061680	5066240	got that little bit of life-saving error and i'm like looking at my cat like how many days would
5066240	5072320	it have been before you started eating my face like i just don't like it was like wow like this
5072320	5076320	close like who would have found me how long before someone would have like suspected something like
5076320	5080560	do cats eat your face the cat the cats start almost immediately you stop moving and they're
5080560	5085920	like food runs out and then they're like well you're right there you look like a big bulldog
5085920	5093120	dogs take a couple days because they're like i feel like this is a test this is like him he fucks
5093120	5101040	with me the cats are like i've been waiting for this the weird thing though is in public not that
5101040	5105360	they can do anything but as soon as it's over with everyone goes right back to their conversations
5105360	5110640	and eating like nothing ever happened they can't be talking about game of thrones they must all be
5110640	5116720	going like what's up with that dude he choked yeah i know it took it took me it took me like
5116720	5120960	10 minutes to recover i couldn't i didn't eat the rest of the night because i was like this is i
5120960	5126400	can't it just i can't do it and then the next morning i woke up to text from you going a guy
5126400	5134720	drunk drunk through my garage i'm like hello wow levy that was my that was my uh my break

5301360	5306480	each one of those lights is someone on reddit making a comment it's either positive or negative
5306480	5310400	it's based on equalizer i think like as the levels it like flickers i don't know

5573920	5581120	to be vulnerable while you're eating okay you guys playing yeah well i'm gonna excuse myself
5581120	5585760	from the stage let's uh let's thank church thank you church thank you for taking us to you
5587760	5588240	charts
5590320	5594960	charts i call her charts did we tell the chart story in the show before our church
5596480	5603280	where were you in columbia yeah she was in a starbucks and in columbia and they asked her what
5603280	5607840	her name was to write on her coffee cup and she said church and her cup came back and it was
5607840	5614000	charts c-h-o-r-t-s so guess what she has called around the house all the time now
5618880	5623200	all right so spencer it's been a good long time since i've been here and guys we haven't played
5623200	5630320	dnd in a long time so would you catch me up and the audience up maybe and kind of give us a
5630320	5634800	brief recap of what the hell's going on yeah do you want the music or no music whatever you
5634800	5643760	want music so while this is happening think about questions that might be relevant to getting you
5643760	5650640	guys personally back on track with understanding what's going on as i say these things last time
5650640	5658400	on harmon quest our heroes had just gotten to door nester they uh got past the guards after
5658400	5665760	a scuffle with undead outside the city the guards were sleepy it seemed and they got inside and once
5665760	5670240	they were in door nester they were like what are we supposed to do because they were on the quest
5670240	5677360	for pachins jab he's gonna keep shoving that up her ass well that's not that's what's happening
5678560	5684000	uh while in door nester they split up to look for clues and get a lay of the land in the sense of
5684000	5690720	the city jeff or uh chad and diarrhea went to the open air black market where they purchased
5690720	5698960	clothes and did aerobics with uh the church of the body temple meanwhile carlos went to the church
5698960	5704640	where he saw geffen was making everyone doing crazy exercises because he said they were all on
5704640	5710640	weed and then carlos talked to one of the people from the church and realized that this city
5710640	5718480	employs a very uh conspicuous theater as one of its industries and was the theater involved
5718480	5726720	in any of the intrigue it might be the case that it was but we'll find out now on harmontown time
5727440	5736000	quest nice all right yeah so are we all together are we still separating me and diarrhea you would
5736080	5741520	just meet met back up to kind of discuss some of your findings but yeah you came to the town you
5741520	5745120	came with pachins to help with the quest for pachins gem because he was going to get the
5745120	5749840	gem back because it was important to him so you snuck into the town well you got into the town
5749840	5754720	i wasn't really sneaking and pachins is not with us right we're pachins is kind of with you he's
5754720	5759840	not like at your beck and call like he kind of shows up and leaves and stuff but yeah but he
5759840	5768800	knows that he knows that we feel recalcitrant he understands that you're trying to help him find
5768800	5776880	his gem yeah okay so uh and reluctant about it yeah let's go to this theater let's go to the
5776880	5785520	theater no when we get there let pachins do all the talking okay can we just watch spencer play dnd
5785600	5790880	by himself i would be so good hey what's going on is there a treasure
5790880	5793840	talking about does that happen that happens
5796320	5800400	all right you make your way to the door nester theater company it's one of the biggest buildings
5800400	5806720	in town it's a modern looking building made out of uh stained planks they're stained almost like a
5806720	5813680	black color and then the the the theater itself has a nice sign that's immaculately and intricately
5813680	5822640	painted that says door nester theater now playing what's playing it has uh it it says the
5822640	5827360	sant it looks like it says the sants but it looks like a bunch of letters are missing so it probably
5827360	5832000	said something else at one point can we buy tickets to the show the box office isn't open
5833920	5838240	why did we want it what was the point of going to the theater when dan was at the church he talked
5838240	5843840	to peach who was one of the people who had been working at the church and stuff and he asked if
5843840	5851040	there was any industries and peach said that the only industries were farming milling flour baking
5851040	5860320	bread in the theater and so i try to open the door uh it's locked it's a heavy double door like an
5860320	5872720	audience-facing door um i try to open the door it's it's locked can you pick the lock uh he's not
5872720	5879040	what what what hour of the day is it sorry uh let's say it's one pm okay uh and i i put my ear to the
5879040	5884480	door uh is there a production going on within there are you hear voices and you hear the sounds
5884480	5891920	of movement like like uh you know loud steps and stomps i knock on the door all right you knock on
5891920	5897520	the door like a polite individual i do a comedic wince because i had my ear to the door when he
5897520	5901680	knocked on it so there's like a little there's there's room for comedy there but it's execution
5901680	5910160	dependent yeah you find room for comedy it um the door slowly opens well it doesn't slowly open
5910160	5917360	after a time the door opens and there's a big fat guy um he's wearing all black and he's wearing
5917360	5921840	black tights and he's kind of like just poking through the door a little bit and he's like
5922560	5929680	you guys aren't you guys aren't with us what does that mean you're not with the theater well i came
5929680	5937520	to audition oh you didn't but why not we're not having audition we don't just have auditions well
5937520	5944640	i think i'd be perfect for the sands what in the new play that i've written
5945760	5951520	which is guaranteed to double your audience size and the funding for your theater it's about horses
5953200	5958320	well that all sounds very great you want to talk to shrove he's kind of the master of the theater
5958320	5964160	yeah let's talk to that guy thank you he's not here where do we find him uh small town he's
5964160	5969360	probably around he's he's usually out out and about who knows what grabs his attention most
5969360	5977040	what grabs his attention most i'd say a snappy loot tune oh snappy loot tune should we go to
5977040	5986000	the center of town and start doing our song well uh just a couple more questions for fatty tights
5986000	5994400	sure uh are you guys uh doing a performance soon yeah we're kind of behind schedule right
5994400	5998480	now but we're trying to we're trying to get some of the understudies up and going with the saints
5998480	6005200	of virtue that's the one we're putting on well we'd love to come see a performance yeah well

6013760	6020960	what you heard him no i didn't what he said what happened to your main cast that had such
6020960	6025680	me created such a demand for understudies the guy who was playing saint aurora and the guys that
6025680	6033440	were playing the cunning nests and the dashing fredo both uh fell absent yeah both all three
6033440	6038800	that's a lot of people falling absent yeah people come and go and kind of like sometimes they go
6038800	6044960	out on uh little troops to do traveling shows and stuff but it's not it's not normal that
6044960	6048560	a bunch of people go missing as a result how many days have they been missing for
6050880	6055920	seven six or seven there are a lot of banditos in this show you're putting on
6055920	6062960	what do you mean bandito characters traveling brigands uh highway robbers this whole city is
6062960	6069840	such you know know what i mean in your show in the character yeah in this show the the
6069840	6074080	ides of saint claire east or whatever you're putting on the saints of virtue yeah i have
6078400	6083360	what's the what's the elevator pitch for that when we invent uh uh what's never mind there's
6083360	6088480	elevators okay well what's the what's the what's the hand cranked elevator pitch for uh
6088960	6094720	clarece's dementia well saint aurora was the the famous saint of virtue along with his his
6094720	6100480	kind of what do you call it swordsman his his his vanguard they were they were known as the
6100480	6106880	saints of virtue and they stood for the various goods of the world and prevented them from falling
6106880	6111520	into corruption and evil those were the guys that wore the purple costumes and they had the
6111520	6115680	like in the stories they always had the big capes and the crazy purple hats
6116400	6120240	i like i don't i don't remember them being purple what did they do what did they know
6120240	6125840	it was what how did they dress again oh how did the saints of virtue dress in the play yeah
6125840	6131520	they dress kind of as like uh paladins or royal royal churchly nights
6134560	6139440	are you guys uh i pull i pull diarrhea and carlos aside and i look at them i go
6139520	6147040	are you guys thinking what i'm thinking pizza pizza party uh all right well thank you what
6147040	6152160	was your name again gretel gretel gretel i thought it was shrove that's that's the master
6152160	6156480	shroves the the church uh the theater well we'll tell shrove you said hi thank you gretel
6156480	6161760	i didn't say hi don't tell him that what was something going down between you and shrove no
6162320	6167360	you guys don't say hi to each other i just didn't i didn't want to i mean well say hi to him yeah
6167360	6170880	no that makes this a lot simpler if i just choose to do that and you know what i'm not
6170880	6174640	going to say to him is that we had to do this negotiation because he might take offense yeah
6174640	6179760	that would be great for me all right rope shrove uh break a leg out there for saints of virtue
6180880	6190720	uh oh yeah yeah it's an expression it means good luck doing your performance right good luck okay
6191520	6195760	actors are superstitious so if you say break a leg although some people think the etymology
6195760	6200640	is more about just the traditional breaking of a leg meaning you pal right what do you guys think
6200640	6208480	we should do well i pitched pizza pizza party but let's go find shrove do we wait i mean yeah
6208480	6211600	let's let's let's head into the center of town where the where the action is is there kind of
6211600	6216400	like a main act like active hub in town spencer um the center of town is kind of the market that
6216400	6221760	you were at you guys want to get on the same page real quick just because yeah it's we're thinking
6221760	6230960	at this point and you know it it's a it's a long shot but that this mysterious theater troop because
6230960	6236880	this town is so not it's not new york i mean they're not there's not like fucking you know
6236880	6242000	thieves guilds everywhere that maybe this theater guild which is a little active for this smaller
6242000	6248800	town and now we're finding out having these actors that have disappeared in the time frame that we
6248800	6258240	got mugged can i go back in my head and imagine you know just because we were in that combat like
6258240	6266080	how many dudes we killed and does that correspond with the number of actors the bandi does wow um
6266080	6271600	i want to say you killed more than three people like maybe five or maybe you're saying that we
6271600	6275920	might have killed the actors that is what you think we're i'm a wall i mean i don't mean to
6275920	6280720	high road you i'm just saying like this is the thin fucking high road we're this is the thing
6280720	6288320	we're following it's the lead that we got okay is that is the idea that uh in this town when you
6288320	6294480	hire people to do crazy shit you hire these actors that it's like kind of like patrick swazie's troop
6294480	6300240	in point blank like they're surfers you don't expect them to be bank robbers yeah
6300240	6308880	yeah jeez all right well let's just go find shrove and we can crash this thing into the ground
6309440	6314480	you know this theory yeah no i i'm just going through my notes i'm i'm it's been so long i'm
6314480	6319200	i'm a little like i'm a little confused well i'm gonna i'm not too uh i'm gonna i'm gonna make you
6319760	6323200	you take the lead on this one well let me let me let me just verbally well we have this chance
6323200	6328960	because i don't want to do this in front of uh non-player characters this will help all of us
6328960	6337840	this is my working theory but it's not i don't believe in it really half a wit that uh we were
6337840	6343520	on the road we were waylaid by bandits they fucked us up they took pachin's gem then we came to this
6343520	6348320	town we're looking around for people that you might hire to do such tasks because the only
6348320	6352160	thing we had to go on was a letter that we can't really read because it's written in this kind of
6352160	6357760	guild script the guild script just means that they're professionals that were hired there is
6357760	6362480	no guild in this town you can't just go to a place that says like here's the place where people go
6362480	6366880	you hire people that rob people there's just people that churn butter cut hair and are in
6366880	6373680	this theater troupe the theater troupe is the is the is the crazy people uh it's you would expect
6373680	6378080	a theater troupe to be smaller in a town this size it should be like three people doing improv
6378080	6383040	like in green bay or something and it'd just be like kind of make the two of them would be bowlers
6383040	6386080	and one of them would be the guy that hangs up the flyers and the other two are tolerating because
6386080	6389040	they secretly fantasize about kicking them out of the troupe but they don't want to they don't want
6389040	6395520	to do the heavy work and uh instead we got like we got a bunch of people you know entertaining a
6395520	6401760	small town and so we're that's it that's that's it that's all we got okay so let's go back and
6401760	6408640	infiltrate this theater company i think we got to find robe shrove shrove i'll be the first to admit
6408640	6414640	like i've been fucking this up forever become a bad leader this is why they had me locked away
6414720	6420480	well now you're shot at redemption here this has been my shot at redemption i've already fucked
6420480	6425440	it up i took the lead on this i'm the reason we're here i'm the reason we took pachin's gem quest
6425440	6430320	instead of the one that was being dangled in front of us i feel bad about all of this is pachins here
6430880	6437920	uh pachin shows up pachins i just want to say to you i'm sorry you know for what for
6437920	6445120	for insisting on helping you when in fact we're the ones that are you know we're the reason why
6445120	6451440	you needed help the last people you had it right the whole time man thanks man that means a lot
6452400	6459440	but it happens though so i just wanted to say that clearly i don't feel like i've been doing
6459440	6463760	this right i think you're beating yourself up for no reason i think we're all we've all made mistakes
6463760	6468480	i think it's you know we we're i gotta tell you something beating me myself up is all i know how
6468480	6473440	to do it's the only thing i know that i'm gonna do that i can do and finish doing everything else
6473440	6482160	i stop beating myself up i try something and i just fuck it up and i i i'm sorry all right the
6482160	6486720	table talk here dan you've got the fucking it's i've been away for so long i don't really remember
6486720	6490560	what the hell's fucking happening so you you you think that the actors might be related to those
6490560	6496720	bandits that we got yeah i guess i mean it's a working theory but it's like it's i say we just
6496720	6502880	like let's just dive into it let's go find shrove throw them up against a wall say what are you doing
6502880	6508720	not literally i don't mean it that way okay so is this is your theater troupe you got a bunch of
6508720	6515920	guys that died because we killed them on a road we uh we go back into the marketplace all right
6515920	6521920	and we uh i i asked like a local shopkeeper that looks like some of them you know knows
6522480	6527920	knows his or her way around town you talked to the fabricators guild gnome that gave you those
6527920	6533120	clothes oh oh i got flashy clothes now all right am i wearing those now yep they put a pep in your
6533120	6540000	step they did uh i say hey do you know a cat named shrove yeah shrove is like uh he's a big
6540000	6543520	big guy around here like everyone knows have you seen him around today we're trying to trying to
6543520	6549360	track him down i don't think i've seen him since uh last evening or so i don't know i haven't seen
6549360	6555040	him today does he have a local like haunt that he hangs out at uh sometimes he's at the tavern i
6555040	6560000	guess most people are sometimes out of the tavern okay we go to the tavern yeah i mean oh okay bye
6561680	6566640	thank you and uh nice to see you again would you like to come with us to the tavern no no
6567520	6573440	i'm busy i didn't mean to be so preemptory to the tavern all right what what what what what
6574160	6580480	a tavern is something the leaky grieve all right this tavern is labeled leaky grieve um
6581120	6589920	as you enter you instantly feel kind of uh leaky at ease you you don't even necessarily notice but
6589920	6595280	as of getting into this town maybe even earlier you've just had a sense of dread and foreboding
6595280	6600480	and sadness and angst kind of sitting in and settling over your body then you barely even
6600480	6605840	noticed it until uh you set you set into this tavern and it actually feels quote unquote right
6605840	6611760	and uh it's great there's yelling and singing and it's raucous and wild and it really has the vibe
6611760	6616960	of what you think door nester seems like it should be this town of ruffians that are going hog wild
6616960	6622800	you know it's a it's a tavern they're yelling and singing and people are throwing shit uh yeah
6622800	6629840	there's a there's a there's a big big beardy guy who's uh he looks like he's like over 100 even
6629840	6635600	though he's a human which is weird well it usually implies like some magic um there's a there's an
6635600	6641200	old dude and he's he's behind the bar and he's he's wiping wiping down the bar and then there's
6641200	6646960	just a bunch of you know random brigand types they just all kind of look dirty and wild and
6646960	6652960	they're kind of scattered around the bar mr barkeep yeah hey how's it going you guys are new
6652960	6662400	huh yeah the name's cool dennis oh thanks cool dennis cool is your first name no i'm so new i

6728240	6732320	it's the bathroom cool dennis why is the bathroom locked because it's like a one person bathroom
6732960	6739280	so i don't need a key it's just someone's in there yeah you think they're pooping i i hate to
6739280	6746240	speculate i stake out the bathroom okay that's weird but yeah well that's not something cool
6746240	6753920	dennis would do but cool dennis uh why do they call you cool that's a great question i don't

6764880	6771120	take a stout dragon hey cool dennis are there any rumors in town about uh ancillary treasures that
6771120	6775520	i could hyper focus on turn into our new quest and totally frustrate everybody i hear there's
6775520	6782240	a bag of holding full of beef jerky in town wait how much how much beef jerky is in the bag of
6782320	6790320	ten by ten by ten feet of beef jerky that's a lot of beef jerky so so people people just
6790320	6795760	hear a bag like that's in town they don't i thought that was exactly what you were asking
6796480	6802240	i mean i guess i i'm telling you it is in this town i know for a fact what's happening in the
6802240	6808400	bathroom bathroom stuff it's uh yeah you hear pooping it's definitely pooping how about another

6841200	6845120	of want to see what that planned about the miss purple one sounds the promising one yes i mean
6845120	6850320	i'd love a bag of holding empty out the beef jerky remember when we tried but knowing a bag
6850320	6857280	of beef jerkies in town does not help you find it no so we're guys we're we're on the quest for
6857280	6861600	patching hey listen man we didn't get out of the pipeline by beef jerky but but get out of the
6861600	6869680	patch the quest for patches gem by committing the quests yeah let's think about the time when you
6869680	6871440	guys tried to make your own beef jerky

7172240	7178720	can't hear me but i feel like we should catch him on the shitter unless we want to have a civil
7178720	7183360	conversation we've caught him on the shit yeah no but i mean like don't let him wipe and flush like
7184880	7189680	he's stuck with his pants down i'm talking about old school shit bust that that might be the
7189680	7196640	title don't let him wipe and flush uh yeah the the the old uh i think clint eastwood said that
7196640	7202320	and unforgiven it's the cowboy code don't let him wipe flush okay so right so we wait
7202320	7205760	amount spencer we wait we wait for this guy to get off the pot well i want to just well
7206400	7211280	before we fast forward to that i want to i want to can we just because we have nothing to do but
7211280	7216080	wait can we can we let's talk strategy okay because we're waiting for a perp to come out of this
7216080	7220000	bathroom this is we could really do this right what would i do with his pants down i'm i'm gonna
7220000	7228880	use flare to dazzle him um i got can you advise me on my loadout what do you mean uh well i just
7228880	7232880	don't know i don't remember i never i didn't i didn't keep track of like what what i'm assuming
7232880	7236640	i think i was i'm probably by default going offensive loadout that's probably i'm gonna
7236640	7241600	assume that's what i've been doing are do i i don't remember what i don't think we've used
7241600	7247360	any spells since the last time we've uh refreshed spells so you should be good for whatever all
7247360	7252160	right so so my best bet at close quarters is inflict light wounds it's a touch that deals
7252160	7262720	uh one die eight damage plus one um and uh i'm level three right so that means oh i could inflict
7262720	7268480	moderate wounds am i right about that uh if it's on your spell sheet right oh okay i see yeah i
7268480	7272000	could summon i mean i'm not gonna summon a monster in this place i don't want a reputation
7272000	7278560	but uh yeah i mean do i have to touch somebody to inflict uh wounds yeah all right so i'm gonna
7279200	7283840	when he comes out i'm gonna dazzle him with a flare okay so he's gonna be bewildered and you
7283840	7288160	got you got to drop on him but how do we you know the best thing would be if we were pros we'd
7288160	7294560	fucking do that and then restrain him you know like do we have an ability to like like instead
7294560	7298960	of killing them like just getting them you know and just hauling them into the church and being
7298960	7303120	like i have chains oh wait wait wait a minute what am i talking about we're on the quest of
7303120	7310560	patches gem we can't haul them into the church we could haul them into the theater we're gonna
7310560	7315440	haul them into an alien all right i i mean i don't even know what we're doing we're over our head
7315440	7320480	it's three minutes after ten so we gotta we gotta we gotta get going well no i feel good let's keep
