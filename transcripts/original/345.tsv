0	25200	Hello gang, how are you all doing?
25200	31400	Tasting, tasting, one, two, three, from across the park where it's still melting in the dark,
31400	35200	Carmen Town is now in session!
40200	45200	Spencer Crittenden, would you please join us on stage, the Game Master extraordinaire?
45200	59200	And let's bring out the mayor of Carmen Town, Dan Harmon.
59200	72200	Hip to the hop, never stop, saw your mama on a raft on a lake, saw your mama for goodness sake,
72200	77200	saw your mama going up and down, saw your mama dancing in a sprinkler shape like a clown.
77200	84200	She got wet, I laid down a hundred dollar bet that she couldn't swim in the water coming out.
84200	87200	The fuck is so hard in the mouth? Okay, gross, gross.
87200	91200	Okay, stop. We go until we get gross, that's the new rule, I like that.
91200	93200	Did you win the bet?
93200	94200	Yes.
94200	95200	Oh, okay.
95200	99200	Also, who was the other person on the other end of that one hundred dollar bet?
99200	104200	I have all the same questions you do.
104200	107200	I only have one item in my notepad.
107200	108200	Oh, yeah.
108200	112200	But we've got a great guest who's very provocative and wonderful to talk to,
112200	115200	so you don't want me to have more in my notepad.
115200	117200	And I already texted Jeff about this today, look.
117200	122200	Okay, there's so many questions I have about this.
122200	129200	But, you know, I texted you his whole monologue, so you know to let me get to all the way to the end,
129200	130200	and then we can all discuss.
130200	134200	I want you to lay it down as you found it.
134200	139200	So I will admit, and I don't do this all the time, it was just kind of a weird impulse I had,
139200	147200	like life's going good, and I left my new home, and I knew the work I had to do,
147200	153200	I knew how long I had to do it, and I was kind of like, I was like, I'm going to stop at this bar,
153200	158200	and it's 1130 a.m., and I'm going to have one before work.
158200	161200	And I'm not usually that guy, I don't judge those guys.
161200	163200	Your name was Cliff Clavin.
163200	167200	And I wouldn't be embarrassed if I was that guy, but I was like, I'm going to give this a try,
167200	173200	and also I'm in a new neighborhood, so I wanted to see what is the new neighborhood's bar like at 1130 a.m.
173200	177200	Well, I'm not going back, because it's fucking packed.
177200	182200	It's like a Friday night for them, because it's a different, it's not, the drawing room is,
182200	185200	I'm really learning is something incredibly special.
185200	190200	So I'll probably be making the trek to continue to drink there when I'm in that day drinking mood,
190200	196200	because this was like a TGI Friday's, but there was this guy, well I had my one drink,
196200	205200	I just eavesdropped, and I heard a monologue from a guy that made me finish my drink very quickly,
205200	211200	settle up in cash, and fast walk to my car so I could finish transcribing it without him knowing I was writing down everything.
211200	213200	And you sent me and Dino a group text.
213200	214200	Right.
214200	218200	And we had a conversation about it, which I'm glad for, because it was kind of like prepped,
218200	224200	because you would be cutting me off every five words if I just read this, you'd be like, wait a minute.
225200	228200	But this is what I texted my two friends.
228200	230200	Dennis two friends.
231200	237200	I just ran out to the car and I was like, so I didn't stand a chance of not getting this all verbatim.
237200	242200	Now I am going to do this in his authentic patois.
242200	248200	He was a six foot five-ish African-American man.
248200	256200	So I'm going to, you know, it wasn't like, just like, look, if we've learned nothing else this week,
256200	260200	we've learned to ask, what's racist?
260200	265200	But I just want to be authentic, because it's more the working class nature of his ranch.
265200	267200	You're doing a authentic.
267200	273200	I'm not going to pretend he's from Jersey, but I'm not going to be like the crows in Dumbo.
273200	275200	I'm not doing a thing.
276200	279200	I don't think it's funny that he talks the way he does.
279200	286200	I just want you to understand, like, this is a working class monologue from a very specific archetype.
287200	289200	What age are we talking?
289200	291200	I would put him at 55, 60.
291200	298200	55, six foot four black gentleman, and he is at the bar next to you.
298200	300200	He's holding court for sure.
300200	308200	And I could tell you some politically incriminating shit that he said before this,
308200	312200	but I don't want to put him in one category or another.
312200	317200	I just found this monologue so fucking fascinating in a vacuum.
317200	322200	I think just start with the narrative, and then we can go back to that if we need to.
322200	327200	Okay, so I'm going to try to do this very tastefully.
327200	329200	I'm also going to try to do it authentically.
329200	332200	Which is how every tasteful story starts.
332200	334200	I'm going to try to be tasteful.
334200	339200	Okay, Lou Diamond Phillips, okay.
339200	343200	Lou Diamond Phillips.
343200	348200	He parked three feet from the curb.
348200	351200	You know what I'm saying?
351200	355200	36 inches.
355200	359200	So I'm writing the ticket, and he comes out,
359200	360200	what are you doing?
360200	362200	Why are you giving me a ticket?
362200	367200	I said, sir, the law is your car needs to be a minimum of 18 inches from the curb.
367200	369200	He says, oh, that's bullshit.
369200	371200	That's bullshit.
371200	374200	So I said, okay, I'll make you a deal.
374200	378200	You can take the ticket, or I can call a tow truck,
378200	381200	and you know it's going to be much more expensive.
381200	386200	And then his wife comes out, and she was much more subtle, more kind.
386200	389200	So I eventually said, okay, I'm not going to call the tow truck,
389200	392200	because I like Lou Diamond Phillips.
392200	393200	You know what I'm saying?
393200	399200	I like his movies, but he came out like an asshole.
399200	409200	And all I'm saying is, so what makes his job more exalted than mine?
409200	412200	He can do his job, but I can't do mine.
412200	413200	Why is that?
413200	416200	And I ran from the bar.
416200	418200	After waiting, I was going to wait.
418200	421200	I was like, I'm like thumb nailing notes, but I was like, he quieted.
421200	424200	He simmered down, because the people he was holding court with,
424200	426200	they were all like, I don't know.
426200	427200	I don't know.
427200	429200	I don't know, Todd.
429200	433200	You're fun to listen to, but I don't know what you want us to say.
433200	437200	Is he the hero of that story, or for him, he certainly is.
437200	442200	I think he's the absolute villain, which is interesting about the conversation
442200	443200	that you and I had.
443200	448200	I absolutely 100% side with Lou Diamond Phillips in this story.
448200	452200	I would first answer this man's question, not that I would have wanted any beef
452200	457200	with him, but I'm like, the answer to his rhetorical question is,
457200	460200	the reason Lou Diamond Phillips can do his job and you can't do yours
460200	464200	is because his job is to make people happy, and yours is to make people sad.
465200	469200	And that's no fault of yours, but not accepting that is weird.
469200	472200	Why does Lou Diamond Phillips get to be celebrated?
472200	474200	He's a celebrity.
474200	478200	Was there no contrition on Lou Diamond Phillips' part about
478200	481200	parking a foot farther away from the curb than his first time?
481200	484200	Well, I mean, this is the only narrative you're going to get.
484200	486200	Here's the quotes from Lou Diamond Phillips.
486200	487200	He said it's bullshit.
487200	488200	It's bullshit.
488200	489200	And he heard the reason.
489200	490200	He's like, nah, it's bullshit.
490200	491200	That's what we got.
491200	495200	And we know his wife was very supple and smooth and, you know,
495200	497200	she got him out of the tow truck.
497200	501200	But it sounds like Lou Diamond Phillips, like any person that parked three feet
501200	506200	from the curb, which I do want to be a law, because that is 36 inches
506200	511200	and that is extreme, it sounds like he had to pay the same ticket
511200	516200	that a garbage man or a parking enforcement officer off duty would have to pay.
516200	518200	It doesn't sound like he actually got away with anything.
518200	523200	It, in fact, kind of sounds, from my perspective, assuming this was 20 years ago
523200	527200	or this guy is the biggest Lou Diamond Phillips fan in the world,
527200	531200	that the only difference between Lou Diamond Phillips and a parking enforcement officer
531200	536200	or a normal person getting a parking ticket is that because he's famous,
536200	541200	this guy has been telling this story for 20 years, whereas otherwise it wouldn't have been a big deal.
541200	545200	I hope it was like yesterday or within the last week.
545200	546200	It has to be recent.
546200	552200	Then that guy's got to be, and here's my one other thought about answering his rhetorical question.
552200	557200	The other reason he can do his job and you can't do yours is because God gave you
557200	565200	and Lou Diamond Phillips both one chance at coping with Lou Diamond Phillips' fame
565200	568200	and you're blowing it.
568200	573200	And Lou Diamond Phillips has made a lot of movies that I know you haven't seen.
573200	576200	You didn't see bats in the theater. I did.
576200	579200	I know Lou Diamond Phillips is good.
579200	581200	Have you guys seen bats?
581200	586200	Everybody right now, in your mind, name four Lou Diamond Phillips films
586200	590200	and you only get one Young Guns.
590200	594200	I actually forgot Young Guns, and I was like, for sure, La Bamba.
594200	596200	He must be thinking about La Bamba.
596200	600200	But you pointed out, you had a very good point, like Young Guns.
600200	604200	Your theory on it was he went into law enforcement because of Young Guns.
604200	611200	Yeah, because Lou Diamond Phillips is the reason why he started to go into law enforcement
611200	619200	is because Lou Diamond Phillips, who is the kind of representative of stoic morality,
619200	623200	and then he meets Lou Diamond Phillips, who's parked too far away from the curve.
623200	627200	He's like, I wanted to be the Young Gun of parking enforcement or the LAPD.
627200	630200	No, he wanted to be in the FBI. He wanted to be another thing.
630200	635200	You don't go into parking enforcement because that was your end game.
635200	636200	That was your thing.
636200	642200	I just wonder how many people weren't assholes that come across him doing his job.
642200	648200	I mean, his job is to really reign on people's parade, and that's not his fault.
648200	651200	What if Lou Diamond Bamba was just on a bad day?
651200	655200	I call him Lou Diamond Bamba because there was an MTV interview.
655200	661200	So he goes, on MTV a long time ago, what's the worst soundtrack you ever heard?
661200	667200	And he goes, what's the worst moment in movie history?
667200	671200	And they asked the guy in New York who was from Brooklyn.
671200	675200	He goes, it's when that Lou Diamond Bamba comes out, and he goes, you know what?
675200	677200	You're all right.
677200	679200	But he called him Lou Diamond Bamba.
679200	682200	That was one of the thought I had as I got to the car.
682200	684200	I was like, wait a minute.
684200	690200	You never changed your middle name to parking enforcement, I bet.
690200	692200	That's a safe bet.
692200	698200	Obviously, at some point, Lou Diamond Phillips or his parents decided he was destined for success.
698200	705200	But is the story of the thing that you ever heard, there was a guy at a bar talking about being a parking enforcement official,
705200	708200	and Lou Diamond Bamba was being an asshole.
708200	711200	Was Lou Diamond Bamba on a bad day?
711200	713200	Oh, yeah, I don't know.
713200	715200	That's a question for him, yeah, for sure.
715200	718200	I mean, who knows?
718200	720200	When do you park three feet from a curb?
720200	724200	Is it because you think that's within your right to do so?
724200	726200	Or is it because he was with his wife?
726200	727200	Maybe she was...
727200	728200	We don't know.
728200	729200	They could have been outside a hospital.
729200	732200	I'm not trying to victim blame.
732200	735200	Then you said the victim being a guy who didn't enjoy writing a ticket.
735200	740200	But the guy was at the bar, then he was watching TV, and he called women bitches for...
740200	741200	Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying.
741200	744200	Like, I already knew the guy was like...
744200	745200	It's the thing, it's like...
745200	752200	I interpreted everything he was saying as like a projection of, you know, this is the thing.
752200	754200	It's like people thinking...
754200	757200	This is why I tend to side with the celebrities.
757200	760200	I tend to side with the publicly shamed.
760200	762200	I tend to side with the visible.
762200	773200	Because I think that people tend to project onto luminaries this like privilege that may be partially true.
773200	776200	I mean, I'm not being like a fucking pure apologist and going,
776200	781200	Oh boy, the actors go to their job and they just work so hard.
781200	783200	Like, it's harder than coal mining.
783200	784200	I'm not implying that.
784200	786200	I will say it's a very hard fucking job.
786200	787200	I should know.
787200	790200	I have fucking worked actors very hard.
791200	793200	I've driven them to the brink.
793200	795200	And then I've said with a kubricky and flair,
795200	798200	Great, now put film in the camera.
799200	805200	Because I needed that from Danny Pooty in that moment.
807200	808200	And you loved it.
808200	810200	And that's why you're here.
812200	816200	I know somebody that ran into Keanu Reeves on a bad day.
816200	820200	And Keanu Reeves was being like surly.
820200	822200	And he's like, fuck Keanu Reeves.
822200	824200	He was a fucking asshole.
824200	825200	You ask anybody else?
825200	826200	Keanu Reeves?
826200	827200	Super cool.
827200	831200	But you can't get one pass if you're a famous person
831200	834200	because if you have a bad moment with somebody, then that's your thing.
834200	836200	I just kind of bristle at that culture of like,
836200	840200	Oh, it's that dire straits video refrigerator guy.
840200	842200	Like, hey, look at that faggot.
842200	844200	He's got his own airplane.
844200	845200	He must be doing something right.
845200	848200	And it's like, because in that monologue, the guy says,
848200	852200	and I like, what do you mean you like Lou Diamond Phillips?
852200	854200	Why don't you hate him now?
854200	857200	Is it because you think that, I mean, obviously,
857200	860200	you believe that he won the lottery.
860200	861200	He didn't earn anything.
861200	863200	Otherwise you wouldn't be asking the question,
863200	865200	why is his job so much more exalted?
865200	869200	You're implying that he's the recipient of pure,
869200	873200	undeserved privilege at the same time as you're saying like,
873200	874200	and I like him.
874200	876200	That's the thing, which is a very familiar thing to me.
876200	879200	It rings this bell in me where I'm like, uh, you know,
879200	882200	every interaction you have with somebody who's just a little bit off in there,
882200	884200	like, like, Oh, your girlfriend's tits or whatever.
884200	886200	And you go like, Hey, go, why don't you go fuck yourself?
886200	888200	And they're like, I'm kidding.
888200	889200	I'm kidding.
889200	890200	You write Rick and Morty.
890200	891200	Why don't you fucking learn?
891200	892200	You're rich.
892200	894200	Are you swimming in a pool full of money?
894200	896200	Why don't you fucking like, you should learn to take a joke.
896200	899200	And it's like, there's something off here with this relationship.
899200	904200	And it's coming from a projection on the part of someone who's asking
904200	907200	themselves, what would I do if I were Keanu Reeves?
907200	912200	And if their answer is dark enough, Keanu Reeves is guilty of those crimes.
912200	916200	And I think that's like a very fundamentally wrong.
916200	919200	Can you conjure up a memory of when you think that you,
919200	923200	you might've misbehaved and that's going to color somebody's memory of?
923200	925200	Oh, I'm sure it's all the time.
925200	929200	I mean, as much as I love it when people interact with me,
929200	932200	I don't, what can I ever do?
932200	934200	I mean, like, I'm not a good person.
934200	937200	I'm not a pleasant person to be around.
937200	939200	So I'm also not an actor.
939200	946200	So I don't, I never consider it my job to be like publicly fucking digestible.
946200	948200	No, but you are.
948200	949200	I was efficient for that.
949200	950200	But thank you.
950200	954200	No, I'm just saying, if somebody were to know who I was
954200	962200	and if somebody were to know who I was and on top of that by whatever
962200	965200	like coincidence, their fault or not their fault,
965200	971200	like I'm not getting a perfect like fucking like I didn't get a drink
971200	972200	for an hour or whatever.
972200	973200	I don't know.
973200	976200	Like it was a story about something I said that was kind of like dick.
976200	981200	Spencer, when we did the the Harmon tour, like a documentary thing,
981200	985200	we watched you go through your first like on camera,
985200	990200	like I am a person that people want to meet and you were kind of mistrustful
990200	994200	or like going through the scrutiny of strangers liking you
994200	997200	for either some reason or no reason or whatever.
997200	998200	Yeah.
1001200	1002200	That's right, Jeff.
1004200	1005200	We'll be right back.
1006200	1010200	I remember like one of the work like there's this story where we were doing
1010200	1014200	the upfronts like remember when we did the see so thing at New York or whatever
1014200	1019200	when it was that terrible, terrible like played with the love makers or whatever.
1020200	1023200	We did like a test of Harmon Quest or something.
1023200	1024200	It was a fucking nightmare.
1025200	1028200	Afterwards, there is someone who is backstage that was like,
1028200	1032200	I guess a fan or something that that was like, hey, great show.
1032200	1035200	And I was like, that was like literally the worst experience,
1035200	1036200	the worst show I've ever done.
1036200	1041200	And like, I just remember like giving that guy like the cold shoulder and I just carried that with me.
1041200	1042200	I'm like, you can't treat people like that.
1042200	1044200	You can't like talk to fans.
1044200	1046200	I wasn't like, you know, go fuck yourself or whatever.
1046200	1049200	But I think that if someone had that interaction, they would be all like,
1049200	1051200	oh, that was kind of a bummer, you know?
1051200	1054200	And so like kind of any time I interact with fans, I think of that.
1054200	1056200	And it's like, well, I never want to do that again.
1056200	1057200	And you know what?
1057200	1061200	I found out pretty recently that that fan wasn't a fan at all.
1061200	1062200	It was Tom Sharpling.
1063200	1066200	And so I feel really, really shitty about it.
1066200	1067200	I thought you'd feel better.
1067200	1070200	No, because like that's like, I don't know.
1070200	1074200	That's like if you were like, oh, and it turned out I like mouthed off to, you know,
1074200	1075200	Keanu Reeves or something.
1075200	1076200	Oh, because you were right.
1076200	1080200	And when you say not a fan, you don't mean dislikes.
1080200	1084200	No, but I just thought it was not an ordinary fan, but then someone also that you would admire
1084200	1086200	and whose opinion would matter a lot to you.
1086200	1087200	Right.
1087200	1088200	Or just like just leads.
1088200	1092200	It's like if one person just had one bad interaction with me and it just, you know,
1092200	1093200	they told that story.
1093200	1094200	That's one thing.
1094200	1097200	But if it's like, oh, there's this guy who could potentially, you know, talk about
1097200	1099200	me to in circles or something.
1099200	1104200	I learned a long time ago, like you walk off stage and you have you thought you had a shitty
1104200	1105200	show.
1105200	1106200	Oh, I did.
1106200	1110200	And then and then somebody comes up to you and goes, I would love that show.
1110200	1114200	You really shouldn't say, no, that show sucks.
1114200	1115200	You're wrong.
1115200	1117200	You just say thank you.
1117200	1122200	And because if they had a good time, like the but what if they're lying?
1122200	1126200	Well, if they walk up and say that, then they're a liar.
1126200	1131200	But if they're saying that and they mean it like you just walk away and say thank you.
1131200	1136200	But I also think, you know, yeah, you never deflect a compliment like which means just
1136200	1138200	like you're wrong.
1138200	1139200	What you just said is wrong.
1139200	1143200	You have bad taste in experiences and people.
1143200	1148200	But you don't that you don't have to do the opposite of that, which is like, for me.
1148200	1149200	Oh, my God.
1149200	1150200	Thank you.
1150200	1153200	You could I've come to go.
1153200	1155200	I was told to stop doing that.
1155200	1158200	And I went from doing that to just going like, thank you so much.
1158200	1160200	That's really nice of you to say.
1160200	1162200	I thought I did horribly.
1162200	1163200	So that's great.
1163200	1165200	You're helping me by feeling that way.
1165200	1167200	And then they'll go, no, I don't know.
1167200	1169200	Well, geez, maybe it was great.
1169200	1170200	Thank you for saying that.
1170200	1171200	You're helping me out.
1171200	1174200	Some of the worst shows I've ever done got the most praise.
1174200	1176200	And I don't know why people said that.
1176200	1177200	Because they're idiots.
1177200	1178200	They don't know.
1178200	1179200	Right.
1179200	1182200	They get off their tractors and they're like, you do do do.
1182200	1185200	I'm gonna go see a famous person.
1185200	1186200	Oh, boy.
1186200	1187200	But they're nailing it.
1187200	1188200	I wouldn't know.
1188200	1191200	I got a marble for a brain.
1191200	1192200	Just kidding.
1192200	1195200	I'm kidding.
1196200	1200200	That's what that guy thinks Lou Diamond Phillips thinks when he gets in his car.
1200200	1203200	He thinks that's why Lou Diamond Phillips parked that far from the curb.
1203200	1205200	He's like, who's gonna give me a ticket?
1205200	1208200	Some marble brain?
1208200	1209200	I was in Young Guns.
1209200	1211200	That's not what Lou Diamond Phillips was thinking.
1211200	1215200	And you said to me in the text, because you were inflamed about this.
1215200	1216200	I wasn't inflamed.
1216200	1220200	I was having fun taking Lou Diamonds Phillips side.
1220200	1221200	You were excited.
1221200	1226200	And you said, like, ask that guy to name two other movies beside La Bamba.
1226200	1230200	And that Lou Diamond Phillips, he wouldn't be able to do it.
1230200	1231200	He might have got two.
1231200	1234200	But I actually forgot Young Guns, which is interesting.
1234200	1237200	Because, well, it makes you realize, because I was actually thinking of Lou Diamond Phillips.
1237200	1239200	Young Guns is terrible.
1239200	1245200	And then made the most of, like, Ben and a dozen movies that are just hard to recall.
1245200	1248200	Like 1997's Bats, which was fucking amazing.
1248200	1249200	And he's great in it.
1249200	1252200	That's Peaked Phillips.
1252200	1253200	See Bats.
1253200	1256200	Also, if you would have dared that guy to name two more movies beside La Bamba,
1256200	1259200	he could have gone Young Guns and Young Guns 2.
1259200	1261200	And you would have been out 100 bucks.
1261200	1262200	All right.
1262200	1264200	Our next guest.
1264200	1268200	What if it was Lou Diamond Phillips?
1268200	1273200	See, if we were a proper podcast, this whole thing would have been a tee up
1273200	1276200	to bringing out Lou Diamond Bamba,
1276200	1278200	and then the whole crowd would have gone fucking berserk.
1278200	1280200	If I deserved my podcast pull-up,
1280200	1282200	I would also have the parking enforcement guy out.
1282200	1285200	And I would do some real fucking work, like the guy that does, you know,
1285200	1288200	heavy weight for Gimlet Media.
1288200	1291200	Like, there's people out there doing real work.
1291200	1293200	I don't know why I continue to occupy space.
1293200	1296200	I think we have the juice to get Lou Diamond Phillips on the show.
1296200	1298200	Well, don't insult him.
1298200	1299200	No.
1299200	1300200	Or you won't get him on.
1300200	1304200	I'm insulting our audience.
1304200	1305200	All right.
1305200	1307200	So our guest tonight has been a guest before.
1307200	1309200	I believe he was a guest last time.
1309200	1311200	It better be Lou Diamond fucking Phillips.
1311200	1312200	There really wasn't an audience.
1312200	1320200	But I got to say, if I had to name three man-crush occupations,
1320200	1325200	like, there was the guy I met who was an Irish firefighter,
1325200	1333200	who I'm like, geez, they fight that too?
1333200	1335200	It's a little racist, but I used to think I was Irish
1335200	1337200	before I sent my spit into a fucking computer.
1337200	1340200	I'm pretty sure that's the definition of racism.
1340200	1342200	Still, though, for all I knew I was Irish.
1342200	1345200	You don't think other cultures fight fires?
1345200	1351200	Look, when I engage in the stereotype of the Irish being fighty,
1351200	1354200	I mean, it's the same as them being poets and singers.
1354200	1356200	I'm like, oh, I got hearts in my eyes.
1356200	1358200	I want to be Irish so bad.
1358200	1361200	And then to be a firefighter, an Irish firefighter, I'm just saying.
1361200	1365200	In your mind, you think Irish, it's the little leprechaun guy.
1365200	1369200	No, I think it's a fucking badass dude that's like, oh, well,
1369200	1372200	you think you love me, but you don't.
1372200	1374200	Get up off the floor now.
1374200	1378200	I'm going to sing a song with me fists.
1378200	1380200	They're beautiful people.
1380200	1381200	They're supernatural.
1381200	1384200	Their cereal has magical.
1384200	1385200	No, stop it.
1385200	1387200	See, that shit's offensive.
1387200	1390200	But anyways, can we please, our guest is waiting in the wings.
1390200	1393200	I don't know what the third man crush occupation would be,
1393200	1396200	but as far as two word occupations, this is right there.
1396200	1398200	Who knows if it's number one or number two.
1398200	1399200	After Irish firefighter.
1399200	1401200	Or before, I'm not sure.
1401200	1404200	Please welcome conflict journalist.
1407200	1410200	Fucking, come on.
1410200	1415200	Put your dicks down and lift your pants back up for Rob Evans.
1416200	1419200	Rob Evans.
1431200	1432200	What up, Rob?
1432200	1435200	Well, Dan answered my question as to whether or not I was going to try
1435200	1438200	a really offensive Irish accent as soon as I got out on stage.
1438200	1439200	So I don't have to now.
1439200	1440200	Thank you for that.
1440200	1443200	Have you been to Ireland in your conflict journaling?
1443200	1444200	No.
1444200	1445200	Oh, okay.
1445200	1446200	No.
1446200	1447200	Fires?
1447200	1448200	No.
1448200	1449200	No.
1449200	1450200	See?
1450200	1451200	I don't think so.
1451200	1453200	Are you ethnically descended from the Irish people?
1453200	1456200	Not at all, but I can sing every word of come out you black and tans.
1456200	1457200	Whoa.
1457200	1458200	Good enough for me.
1458200	1459200	Let's hear it.
1459200	1460200	Let's hear it.
1460200	1461200	Uh-oh.
1461200	1463200	Do you really want to sing with him?
1463200	1465200	He does, but don't take that as any.
1465200	1466200	What's the song?
1466200	1467200	It's come out you black and tans.
1467200	1470200	It's an old IRA song about beating up British paramilitaries
1470200	1471200	in the streets of Dublin.
1471200	1473200	Give us the first refrain of that.
1473200	1476120	You black and tans, come out and fight me like a man.
1476120	1479840	Show your wife how you won medals out in Flanders.
1479840	1486200	Tell her how the IRA made you run like hell away from the green and lovely lakes of Kiloshandrill.
1486200	1487200	Wow.
1487200	1488200	Bam.
1488200	1494800	So the first couple rhymes, you're thinking, oh shit, this is racist.
1494800	1496880	And then you're like, oh no, he likes the black and tans.
1496880	1497880	No.
1497880	1498880	What?
1498880	1499880	No.
1499880	1500880	He wants to fight them.
1500880	1501880	No.
1501880	1503180	I thought he admired them and wanted them to fight with him.
1503180	1504180	He wants to beat the shit out of them.
1504180	1505180	He wants to beat up the black and tans.
1505180	1511220	It's a drunken Irish militant being like, oh, you won medals in World War I, you fucking
1511220	1512220	pants.
1512220	1513220	Come out and fight me.
1513220	1514220	I'll beat you up.
1514220	1515220	Oh.
1515220	1516220	Yeah.
1516220	1517220	That's what the song is about.
1517220	1518220	But is the black and tans his battery?
1518220	1519220	It's referencing a uniform, not a skin.
1519220	1520220	It is a uniform, yeah.
1520220	1521220	Not a skin color.
1521220	1522220	No, no, no, no, no.
1522220	1523220	Not a skin color.
1523220	1524220	Everyone was very white.
1524220	1525220	Right.
1525220	1526220	So it's fine.
1526220	1527220	Right.
1527220	1530700	That's when you grew up in a country like Ireland, you have to, it's like the pigmentation
1530700	1535340	of your clothes has got me in a fucking xenophobic rage.
1535340	1536940	They did kind of invent that, right?
1536940	1539580	It's like, is that an orange band around your arm?
1539580	1540580	All right.
1540580	1541580	Sorry if you're Irish.
1541580	1545020	Do not attack.
1545020	1547860	These people can beat up fire.
1547860	1549700	I do not want to cross them.
1549700	1557060	But you go everywhere where I would never want to cross.
1557060	1559940	You just got back from Syria by way of Mexico or?
1560180	1561180	No, no.
1561180	1562180	I was just there for a wedding.
1562180	1563700	You went to, oh, Mexico was a wedding.
1563700	1564700	Yeah.
1564700	1565700	Yeah.
1565700	1566700	That was just fun.
1566700	1567700	Syria was for work.
1567700	1568700	Yeah.
1568700	1569700	It went in by Iraq.
1569700	1574300	And you gave me a little thumbnail of what you were doing out there, which I thought
1574300	1575900	was really interesting.
1575900	1580700	The precursor being that you're kind of a, you're freelance, right?
1580700	1585060	Because you don't, like you said, the big news organizations, they don't send you to
1585060	1590860	the Middle East unless you're going to do a story that fits in a, you're doing ISIS
1590860	1591860	stories.
1591860	1592860	Yeah.
1592860	1593860	Yeah.
1593860	1595340	It's hard to get like, it's hard to get a big paper to pay for you to go out to Syria
1595340	1596340	because it's very expensive.
1596340	1599740	They usually want you to travel with like security, which kind of bollocks everything
1599740	1600740	up.
1600740	1602620	I imagine they have to ensure the hell out of you.
1602620	1603620	Yeah.
1603620	1607220	Like it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars pretty easily for like even just a
1607220	1610060	single reporter in there for a couple of weeks.
1610060	1614380	You're freelancing and you're selling your stories to different media outlets or?
1614380	1616060	I don't have to do that anymore.
1616060	1620580	So I got, I do a couple of podcasts for, um, I heart radio behind the bastards is like
1620580	1621580	the big one.
1621580	1623180	And so like, that's my regular job.
1623180	1625420	I got, I got the one fan whistling somewhere.
1625420	1629860	And these are the, these are the stuff, stuff, stuff, how stuff gets made stuff.
1629860	1634340	They don't, they got acquired by a series of companies and that's the way things work.
1634340	1635340	I guess.
1635340	1637780	Um, are you a print or photo or both?
1637780	1641660	I do print and I do, uh, podcasts like online and stuff.
1641660	1645300	Um, so like the, I just raised a bunch of money from my fans.
1645300	1649700	I just asked people, like I said, I'll write this audio book about how right wing terrorism
1649700	1650860	works in the United States.
1650860	1656260	And this sort of plot started in the 1980s, um, to create like a network of stochastic
1656260	1659820	randomly organized terrorists to carry out attacks, to stabilize the country, how this
1659820	1661140	all like came together.
1661140	1664180	And I'll write that and I'll put it out for you if you guys raise a bunch of money for
1664180	1670100	me so that I can go to Syria and crowdsource to journalism by gum.
1671100	1676620	What, what brand of gum it's, it's, it's, it's both an amazing thing and also a sad
1676620	1678980	Testament to our, to the state of journalism.
1678980	1679980	Quit dodging the question.
1679980	1680980	What are you going to do?
1680980	1681980	What brand of gum?
1681980	1684300	It had better fucking be big league two.
1684300	1686500	Um, you're damn right.
1686500	1687500	Big week two.
1687500	1688500	Okay.
1688500	1691420	So was this a crowdsource to fair the, like what you were doing the story you were doing
1691420	1692420	out there.
1692420	1693420	So tell us about this.
1693420	1695100	This is, this is like, okay.
1695100	1698620	So this is like, there's a complicated story and it's hard to tell like how far back to
1698620	1700580	go when trying to explain this.
1700580	1705220	Like the short, if I'm like pitching this on an elevator is there's like a quasi-anarchist
1705220	1709460	feminist revolution in Northern Syria and they're sort of the folks who did most of
1709460	1711020	the fighting to beat ISIS.
1711020	1715340	Um, and so we were hanging out with these people and like talking with them about how
1715340	1719340	their system works and like watching this sort of thing develop.
1719340	1723020	Um, and that's like the, the, the short pitch.
1723020	1728180	When you say anarchist, you mean like proper old school, like, like, like political anarchism,
1728220	1732900	like not, not, not anarchic, where people think that word doesn't mean anything.
1732900	1735380	This is where we get into the longer explanation of it.
1735380	1739580	And the longer explanation is that there is this Turkish Kurdish terrorist named Abdullah
1739580	1744500	Ajalan, who was like an absolutely a terrorist, killed a shitload of innocent people back
1744500	1745500	in the day.
1745500	1750540	And then in the late nineties, he gets arrested by the United States, um, in I think Kenya
1750540	1752180	and a couple of, there was another country involved too.
1752180	1756180	Anyway, he's been on an Island prison in Turkey this whole time, like for the last 20 years
1756180	1757380	or so.
1757380	1761460	And in the last 20 years, he's sort of like moderated and he's just done a bunch of reading
1761460	1766420	and he came upon an American anarchist philosopher named Murray Bookchin and he started writing
1766420	1769180	stuff where he's like, Oh shit, I was wrong.
1769180	1771020	Number one, I was wrong to be a Marxist, Leninist.
1771020	1774740	Number two, uh, the kind of terrorism I was advocating isn't okay.
1774740	1779740	And if we're going to actually reform society in a way that fixes things like I wanted to
1779740	1783700	fix them rather than just trying to overthrow the government and institute our own, we need
1783700	1789060	to actually overthrow the systems of oppression that are at the basis of all authoritarianism,
1789060	1791420	which is the domination of women by men.
1791420	1795660	And so we need to fundamentally reorganize society in order to fix the gender imbalance
1795660	1797140	if we're going to fix anything.
1797140	1802100	And due to a series of like weird flukes of history, the terrorist group that this guy
1802100	1806700	is the figurehead of wound up being the most powerful force in Northern Syria when ISIS
1806700	1810220	was on the March and they formed a couple of little subsidiary groups that then took
1810220	1815100	on a life of their own and got us air support and backing and they beat ISIS.
1815100	1817900	And now they're in control of a region of about 4 million people.
1817900	1821520	And so for the last couple of years that there's been like, okay, well we have all of this
1821520	1822520	political theory.
1822520	1825300	This guy's been writing and now we're in charge.
1825300	1827260	We should see if it works.
1827260	1832020	And it kind of seems like it does kind of, are they being, are they being like proper
1832020	1837060	anarchists like Paris commune and like Mikhail Bakunin and Grapatkin and Emma Goldman and
1837060	1838060	all that.
1838060	1841540	But call them anarchist inspired in certain areas.
1841540	1842540	Another way I've heard it.
1842540	1847300	I just, a journalist today was telling me he thinks it's, his opinion of Rojava, which
1847300	1853560	is what the region is called, is the world's most effective direct democracy governed by
1853560	1858740	an authoritarian system in which, so you've got the military, which is central in a lot
1858740	1861900	of aspects because they need to defend this region, both from the Assad regime, which
1861900	1867580	are assholes, and from the Turkish government, which are also not very nice, particularly
1867580	1871580	since it's a Kurdish led liberation struggle.
1871580	1875940	So they're in charge of a significant amount of what goes on there, but not on the civil
1875940	1876940	side.
1876940	1882220	Are they anarchists in the proper sense of where like it's really like a true democratic,
1882220	1887780	the like anti-rule where everybody like decides their own fate and stuff like that?
1887780	1888780	Somewhat.
1888780	1889780	There's a lot of that in there.
1889780	1891660	So it's bottom up political organization.
1891660	1895500	And so they have communes on like the lower level of thing where like different neighborhoods,
1895500	1899260	every neighborhood will elect, like have sort of a direct democracy where they vote
1899260	1903500	for representatives of the neighborhood, which represent them at like the city level, which
1903500	1907220	represents the city at like the Canton level, which is roughly analogous to a state.
1907220	1909300	And like it builds up from there.
1909300	1914020	One of the rules they have is that when they elect representatives, they'd never just elect
1914020	1915020	one representative.
1915020	1918300	So you don't just have a president in charge of food production.
1918300	1921340	You have two presidents and they're always a man and a woman.
1921340	1925940	And the idea is that you should never have just a man or just a woman in charge of anything.
1925940	1927780	It should be both simultaneously.
1927780	1931340	And they have to come to an accord personally about what they're going to do before anything
1931340	1932340	could be done.
1932340	1933780	And this is law throughout.
1933780	1934780	Yeah.
1934780	1935780	Rojava.
1935780	1936780	Wow.
1936780	1937780	About four million people living under this right now.
1937780	1938780	Yeah.
1938780	1943260	And historically what's going to happen is that both other sides are going to come back
1943260	1949140	in and absolutely squash them because they don't that if the threat of actual democracy
1949140	1950140	breaks out.
1950140	1951140	They get murdered.
1951140	1953100	They get absolutely hammered.
1953100	1956220	And it's you can see that in the offing all around it.
1956220	1960620	So most of where we were was within a mile or two of the Turkish border.
1960620	1964860	Like I had cell reception through Turkish cell networks the whole time I was there.
1964860	1969060	And you can see the military forces there, the YPG and the YTVJ are building hundreds
1969060	1973020	of miles of tunnels underneath everything because they're just waiting for the Turkish
1973020	1974300	forces to invade.
1974300	1977740	And there's this gigantic border wall that the Turks have built that's like 20 feet
1977740	1980780	tall and topped with concertina wire and guard towers behind it.
1980780	1984580	And like every day we were there the president of Turkey would send out another threat saying
1984580	1989100	like I'm going to wipe these people out like if we don't get this exclusion zone we want
1989100	1992540	if the U.S. doesn't pull back I'm just going to invade and like we'll see what happens.
1992540	1996180	And he's been throwing threats out that like that out for a while.
1996180	2000380	And the Assad regime is still in control of most of Syria at this point.
2000380	2004140	And like to the extent that there's one city where they share joint control of and we were
2004140	2008380	like three feet away from the Assad regime and there's like statues of Bashar al-Assad
2008380	2013660	and his troops glowering at you on one side and there's like the YPG on the other side
2013660	2017540	and it's very tense in some places.
2017540	2021580	But then you travel like five miles back and you'd be like sitting at this like local council
2021580	2025340	meeting where it's just like a bunch of old women in their 60s and 70s talking about how
2025340	2030120	they're handling like they don't have cops to deal with stuff like domestic disturbances
2030120	2031920	and like that sort of thing.
2031920	2037440	Like civil law enforcement is all done by an elected commune of like people in the town
2037440	2040480	who just like go door to door and there's like a fight or something and like counsel
2040480	2041480	it out.
2041480	2042480	And that's your anarchy functionally.
2042480	2043480	Yeah.
2043480	2046280	Because it's because people need not be governed necessarily they can figure shit out they're
2046280	2047520	kind of designed for it.
2047520	2049760	There's usually better at it yeah.
2049760	2058460	I got a I got a bookmark that it it's amazing to me how some thoughts are have so much power
2058460	2064660	because this guy who was a warlord autocratic terrorist minded guy who spent time in prison
2064660	2071540	and then had that realization is like reaching me who's like a renowned woke Westerner like
2071540	2075020	where I'm going like holy shit yeah that's a that's a really good fundamental point that
2075020	2078620	misogyny is the atomic unit of autocracy.
2078620	2083620	Like that's what he's saying is like you can't go into an honest conversation about whether
2083620	2088940	or not mankind need be governed when you're walking into you're governing half of the
2088940	2094140	species when you're when you're yeah when you were socialized to like get innervated
2094140	2099460	by any discussion that you think is not political about whether or not Becky should be acting
2099460	2101140	the way she's acting.
2101140	2104420	One of the really interesting things out there because we talked to hundreds and hundreds
2104420	2110420	of people and we spent time at a military training base for the the YPJ which is the
2110420	2116260	all women's militia so all of society and all women's militia all women I've got some
2116260	2120780	pictures yeah that's awesome yeah so all of society there's two chunks there's general
2120780	2125500	society which is male and female and should be as close to a 50-50 mix as possible that's
2125500	2130260	the goal and then there's usually a woman's auxiliary because they understand that like
2130260	2134980	this is fucking Syria like shit's been really rough for women here for a long time and we
2134980	2139420	need all women's groups so that these like member like women who've been members of tribes
2139420	2143820	where like there hasn't been any representation of women for a very long time can kind of
2143820	2147260	learn the ropes of speaking for themselves without having to be like making decisions
2147260	2152580	in the same room as some like older man who's just going to kind of walk all over them.
2152580	2158020	You have an even all-female auxiliary army yeah you want to see pictures yes okay let's
2158020	2162340	see I got it on the back here I mean like yeah we have to have conversations and outside
2162340	2167220	of writers rooms about how being conscious of like like women being socialized to bear
2167220	2172460	interruption more than men are socialized to not interrupt and like I can't even begin
2172460	2178180	to admit that's that's any rich first world empire I had a weird experience sitting on
2178180	2183180	the floor drinking coffee with these young women talking about how they have to avoid
2183180	2187380	fake male feminists and how like yeah there's guys in here that will say all the right things
2187380	2195860	when you interview them he's sitting right next to you right next to you we call it virtue
2195860	2199880	signaling like they didn't use that word but they were like a lot of these guys they
2199880	2203580	talk the talk but like you know that they don't really believe and if things were to
2203580	2208780	change society societally they would go back to the way things were and my fixer who's
2208780	2213020	this wonderful woman Khabat she's one of the most incredible people I've ever met when
2213020	2216820	you say fixer you mean what a fixer is the person who leads you around they usually interpret
2216820	2221740	they translate they get you access do you speak the local dialect or are you I speak
2221740	2225940	a little bit of Serani enough to like get by which is the Iraqi Kurdish dialect my
2225940	2231180	karmaji which is the the Syrian Kurdish dialect is garbage and I barely know pleasantries
2231180	2235060	you have you have a handler that's taken yeah taking you around yeah yeah you usually do
2235060	2238820	in a war zone and like it is much as like you need someone to like drive for you which
2238820	2243860	was in our case this dude a lawn who this has nothing to do with anarchism or feminism
2243860	2249940	but the love this man had for cigarettes was pure and beautiful like I've never seen a
2249940	2255420	man enjoy terrible cigarettes as much as a lawn he would just smile at us with like
2255420	2259580	this this he usually worked with women because our fixer usually would only work with female
2259580	2263740	journalists he's made like capri 100 no they just won't smoke because they're like from
2263740	2268180	New York or whatever and like they don't like it oh okay he was working with like two men
2268180	2271420	and neither of us are regular smokers but we were willing to humor him so we wound up
2271420	2275540	smoking like three packs a day just to make a lawn happy because the joy on his face was
2275540	2282700	so pure but they were crap cigarettes oh they're garbage all right the world sends
2282700	2290020	its worst cigarettes to Syria and we put it in English on the pack yeah there's no warnings
2290020	2294620	on the packs like that's how bad the cigarettes are they don't it says it won't give you cancer
2294620	2308580	sorry Dan you're on the ground Rob and you're gathering stories you're going through a handler
2308580	2315100	that's interpreting for you and what is your relationship with like locals like when they see
2315100	2321260	you do they see you as a friend a threat or just kind of a non-combatant like it's easy going well
2321260	2325100	this is you know one of the things about the Middle East is that like or at least the parts of it
2325100	2328740	I've been to because I don't have a comprehensive knowledge but I spent a lot of time in Iraq and
2328740	2335100	I've now been to Syria I spent a bit of time in Turkey and in the UAE people one-to-one no matter
2335100	2339500	what you're doing are incredibly friendly on like a general basis and like some of them will like
2339500	2344060	happily tell you like oh yeah the Marines killed my family or like a US bomb killed my dad or
2344060	2347820	whatever but like you want to go have tea or like or if you need a place to stay for that I'll put
2347820	2352460	you up for the night it's just like it's a culture they take you as a one-on-one like just regular guy
2352460	2357780	it's just sort of politeness and welcoming a guest is like a deeper thing than religion in that part
2357780	2361980	of the world and so I've almost never gotten a cold reception are there women that do what you do
2361980	2366500	that would get the same reception or is it is it easier to be a male journalist doing that it
2366500	2372700	depends in a little bit on the situation there are certain times where it's easier to be a woman just
2372780	2378700	because people will be friendlier to you it's much harder in other ways and in some ways more
2378700	2382780	dangerous but like if you're working with the military for example you can get a lot of pictures
2382780	2385900	of stuff you shouldn't be able to get pictures with if you're a woman and you'll just pose with
2385900	2389740	the guys for a shot on their cell phones and then like you take pictures of the military base you
2389740	2395180	can take pictures of the tanks like they'll let you do whatever it's just sort of like how much
2395180	2399660	you're willing to kind of lean on that because you think you're taking selfies you can just disguise
2399660	2405020	I went with my wife to Iraq three times and when we got back from the second trip she'd met all
2405020	2409900	these Iraqi soldiers and like they'd all exchanged Facebook information we'd gotten some like great
2409900	2414940	access and like had a really good time and then we like we're in Istanbul in the hotel and she
2414940	2419340	pulls open Facebook and she starts getting faith or a whatever Facebook like video message from
2419340	2423660	like 30 to like half of the Iraqi fifth federal police battalion you're like being like hey you
2423660	2428060	want to talk you they don't speak any English are you like do you ever get any watch list
2428060	2432700	bullshit from like customs and stuff like that I never have any issue okay well how do you file
2432700	2440540	that emotionally or slash socio politically as a as a nomadic journalist like who's probably
2440540	2447820	doesn't have as many like prejudices um but okay that's your wife and then the Facebook messages
2447820	2452460	come in do you file that as predatory do you do you have a different way of looking at that
2452460	2459340	I mean they're not it like it's um it's it's it's complicated uh like there's a lot of really
2459340	2464380	gross misogynistic anti-woman behavior that you encounter in that part of the world even if it's
2464380	2471020	hidden from you even if they don't show it to you as a guest um in that particular case I got the
2471020	2476300	feeling that these were just lonely soldiers up at the front line who wanted to meet a friend
2476300	2482140	it's like if you were a uso iformer and you and they were on a submarine or something I mean as
2482140	2485820	you should always do in those situations I kind of went off of her feelings and at every given
2485820	2488700	step was like how do you feel about this like what do you want to do well you don't have to
2488700	2497340	high level that yeah when you when you post your uh like your pieces are if you're emailing them
2497340	2502140	back to your source or to your uh you know wherever you're sending it to do you get um
2502940	2510140	like any what do you call it like like what's the word Davis censorship are they going through
2510140	2514700	your stuff and censoring you no but you know for there's a couple of things I should point out one
2514700	2518700	is that I don't do like the daily like I don't work for the New York Times I don't work for um
2518700	2523340	you know the BBC I'm not like filing stories every day and then having them like run up on the air
2523340	2527820	that's not the kind of work I do as a general rule I just come home with whatever I come home
2527820	2532220	with write whatever I want to write with and some of it gets published some of it they're not
2532220	2537580	interested in um right in this case nobody's going through and bolderizing and censoring your stuff
2537580	2543020	no I um I spent like a weird morning in Mosul during the fighting they're just watching like
2543020	2549660	us airstrikes hit apartment blocks and stuff and like um nobody censored try to stop me from
2549660	2556460	talking about that and are these considered I mean like but we're talking about places where
2556460	2562460	it's not even it's not even explicitly declared whether or not there's a war going on or not
2562460	2569420	it's just it's just a mixing bowl of conflict so are you wearing a vest that says press and would
2569420	2575020	that matter I did the first when I went to Ukraine which is my first trip out I wore a vest um just
2575020	2579260	because I didn't know what to expect and I was like meaning what do you mean Kevlar do you mean
2579260	2585260	yeah like uh but I'm also talking about just like this sort of like hey I'm I'm a journalist kind of
2585260	2591100	like insignia in most of these areas if you're like a clearly American person walking around
2591180	2595340	everyone kind of knows your press like especially in like these parts of Syria like the only
2595340	2600540	Americans going through either UN foreign aid and there's not that many of those people who are like
2600540	2605420	like westerners or you're you're just a journalist what's the reaction uh when you meet locals and
2605420	2610060	they know that you're from the US or that you're not from Syria like what's their reaction to you
2610060	2616140	are they are they friendly uh automatically or wary of you nine times out of ten people are
2616140	2622140	friendly the only places I got really negative reactions in Syria were um when we were in Raqqa
2622140	2625980	which was the former capital of the Islamic State there were a lot of older men who you could tell
2625980	2631660	had kind of bought into the status quo under ISIS and you got a lot of staring daggers at them very
2631660	2638140	mean looks at them like we uh we also went to Al-Haul which is the the refugee camp where they're
2638140	2643180	hosting most of the arrested ISIS brides so like the women who had like left parts of the western
2643260	2649340	world and joined the Islamic State um and a lot of them like we had this one weird moment where
2649340	2652220	we're walking through the camp and we're just surrounded by these women and they're in they're
2652220	2655740	in full niqabs which is like the full black headdress and it's like as soon as you try to
2655740	2659820	lock eyes with them they flip down this little visor thing so you can't even see their eyes
2659820	2663820	and like we've been out with um we've been talking to like guards at the camp who'd been
2663820	2667580	showing us like knife wounds and bite marks and stuff because like a lot of these women like some
2667580	2670860	of them will make shibs or they'll get knives smuggled in and they'll stab a guard and then
2670860	2674860	they'll run back into the crowd and you can't tell who did it so like we were just surrounded
2674860	2679340	by this crowd of women you can't see their eyes or anything and like that was like definitely
2679340	2684700	some navigative vibes there but I also had a long conversation in like a trailer with these two
2685260	2690940	ISIS women who had willingly joined the Islamic State from uh Jamaica and Barbados and they spoke
2690940	2695820	perfect English and we're talking about like like literally one of the sentences I heard was when we
2695820	2703980	first came to the Islamic State it was Irie and it was like wow and like at one point my my
2703980	2709100	colleague and I Jake Hanrahan um who's a British conflict journalist it was Irie yeah it was Irie
2709100	2712860	fucking hell and we're like we're having this pleasant conversation you're very polite to us
2712860	2718380	but like tell the truth if the walls came down right now Jake asks you'd have our heads cut off
2718380	2724300	and they're like yeah it's just like okay well at least we're on the same page yeah yeah well we
2724300	2731340	in the we in the states here I mean we do when I the way I met Wyatt Sinek was uh he was doing
2731340	2735740	that Courtney Cox pilot that was ripping off Daily Show so a million years ago like when I
2735740	2739900	was working for Dino as a writer and we did this like remote piece where Wyatt went to talk to
2739900	2744700	Terry Metzger the head of the Aryan former head of the Aryan nation and like it was like it was
2744700	2750620	like all this gag you know it was like of course he you know it's like like the white nationalists
2750620	2753660	back then it was like it was always like a puzzler of like really they want us to
2754540	2760300	send a black guy and a gay guy to talk to them about who they hate more and really it's like
2760300	2769340	like oh yeah it that's my segue into the fact that what amazes me about you is you go and do
2769340	2775500	all this other stuff so I'm pretty sure blackout drunks aside that the last time you were on the
2775500	2782540	show I spent a great deal of my energy going like how do you have the chutzpah the gumption the
2782540	2789420	stuff to like to go to these corners of the earth not to maybe corners the others is a
2789420	2796540	that's a eurocentric kind of right in the middle uh yeah they're they're they're like in the yeah
2796540	2802860	like the fertile crescent of everything the navel of the earth yeah yeah that's that's
2802860	2809020	actually really um it's undulating dance summoning all of it okay there we're like we're
2809020	2814860	like right in the middle of its four-pack if it's got like pretty good abs yeah what was the uh
2814860	2822620	the tipping point for you to just decide to go out and go into pretty like sketchy dangerous
2822620	2828140	parts of the world to be a journalist I mean you know it was um it was this really it kind of came
2828220	2833420	from a really narcissistic place of just growing up raised on hollywood action movies um and not
2833420	2839980	being willing to join the military um but like wanting to know what it was like to see conflict
2839980	2844380	and to even like having this desire like I want to know what it's like to get shot at um and then
2844380	2849020	going there and realizing like oh that stuff is like one percent of what you do and mostly what
2849020	2854780	you do is meet like the nicest people you've ever met because there's something about not that war
2854780	2859580	is good for you which is a bad would be a bad lesson to take from this but that conflict and
2859580	2865020	terrible circumstances tend to reveal the best in people more often than they reveal the worst
2865020	2871180	and then those stories don't get clicks no they sure don't that no that fear and evil kind of
2871180	2877900	propagate by you know the fear that I feel when I think about the Middle East as a hornet's nest
2877900	2883980	in a place I'd never go as part of the problem and yeah that that that you're inoculating things
2883980	2889500	somehow you know you're you're you're going deep in there but the but the I mean the thing that
2889500	2897180	blows my goddamn mind is that on the ride over here I mean I'm like reading your very thoughtful
2897180	2901260	stuff because it's like look I wouldn't want to I wouldn't have dismissed you as an adrenaline
2901260	2906460	junkie however I would have been able to at least find a place for you on my map of the cosmos as
2906460	2911340	like a guy who's like wants to be where the action is and where the truth is and stuff
2911980	2920940	but you're you're you have this you you are really into you you're investigating this domestic
2920940	2927740	situation that we've got going on and that and that involves absolutely no romantic hurt lockery
2927740	2933900	fun like to pack your bags and duck your head because the rotors are buzzing and things like
2933980	2941820	it's all just mind-numbing heart aching investigation into the gears of the fucking
2942620	2947980	chan and the 4chan thing it did get a bounty on my head I'm sure it yeah yeah yeah from 4chan
2947980	2955180	15 bitcoins I would I wouldn't be I probably faster than any work you've done yeah in the
2955180	2961020	most dangerous places on earth which is how much uh are you a big history buff like how much yeah
2961100	2966780	how much like knowledge do you have to go into that when you when you land and hit the hit uh
2966780	2970140	hit the ground in Syria do you have to know about the the whole history of it
2971020	2977100	because I mean in a in a much shittier like way less important version of that what you're doing
2977100	2984300	I did comedy in Kosovo and trying to learn about the Balkans and like what what's gone on there
2984300	2990060	it's crazy and there's no getting around how complicated all that is and I read and I read
2990460	2993980	and I read and read and I'm like I still don't know what the fuck is going on there
2993980	2999180	yeah you know it's um I'm a big believer like when I report on white nationalism um I've read
2999820	3004300	almost everything like pretty much everything yeah and you're foreign right yeah big fan
3004300	3009180	yeah big fan I mean it's it's once you do just the cursory amount of research it's
3012540	3019180	it sells itself sorry Rob go ahead um no so like I do a lot of I've tried to get deep into the
3019180	3023500	history on that but when it comes to like I do as much reading as I can but like really you can't
3023500	3030220	understand the full depths of all of these conflicts yeah that's 600 years of fucking conflict yeah
3030220	3035020	so like what you do is you ask people there what they think you need to know um and like you have
3035020	3039980	you do that to enough people that you feel like you've gotten a good base of like things like what
3039980	3043580	I actually need to understand in order to understand this place and then you take what they've told you
3043580	3048060	when you do more research and you try to present things with as much context as you can but you
3048060	3052780	also accept that like there's only certain stories you can effectively report on about
3052780	3057500	that part of the world as someone from outside of it because like you don't speak the language you
3057500	3062460	don't have an in-depth knowledge of the history um which is why the kind of stuff that I have been
3062460	3066620	trying to report on like what I focused on when I was in Syria is the stuff that's going against
3066620	3070780	the grain of history which is very much like what everyone in Rojava will tell you they're trying to
3070780	3076940	escape from as like the grain of history that has caused so much problem or so many problems for like
3077020	3080780	the people in that region over such a long span of time and has caused all these structural
3080780	3086300	imbalances is there a generational thing that's happening where like there's a youthful kind of
3086300	3092220	like a upsurge of like let's escape the past yeah that's a big part of it and you you meet
3092220	3096380	a lot of older people there who you know like the women I would talk to who would say like I don't
3096380	3099660	think this guy really means that I don't think that guy really means that I think this guy's
3099660	3103820	playing lip service and you would kind of have to parse it with the older guys which one believe
3103820	3107500	which one's believed in sort of the feminist revolution aspect of what was going on and which
3107500	3112620	ones didn't and so a lot of my conversations were trying to like figure out like how the old guys
3112620	3116540	felt about it and then at one point we wind up in this office with a bunch of a sayish which are
3116540	3121260	like the local military police and it's a mixed everyone in there is in their early 20s and it's
3121260	3126780	a mix of young women some of whom are wearing uh headdress headscarfs and some of whom are wearing
3126780	3131740	are just like bareheaded and like men and a lot of them have tattoos and they're all like I said in
3131740	3135420	their early 20s and I start asking them this like how do you feel about men and women working
3135420	3139820	together how do you feel about this new system and they all start really awkwardly giggling
3139820	3143660	to the point where it's obvious it was obvious that it was like if I'd walked into a mixed
3143660	3148540	group of like men and women working together in like Orange County and been like how do you guys
3148540	3151980	feel about women and men working next to each other and they would all be like what the fuck
3151980	3156700	are you talking about dude like that and and that was the thing like the people that I got to know
3156700	3161500	well in talking about they were like the we just have to keep the old people who don't really
3161500	3166460	believe shamed into falling in line long enough for them to die off and the young people to grow up
3166460	3174300	living this really wow yeah so how big is that dangerous methodology yeah can we do a Logan's
3174300	3180460	run so it turns out some of them can whip that fire whip right around Gandalf's ankle uh right
3180460	3189020	at the last minute and get a whole new this this women-based uh militia and like kind of uh yeah
3189020	3193260	you can see him if you pull up picture number seven I think was that oh we got pictures oh
3193260	3199260	yeah there's pictures oh yeah what were you asking oh yeah oh shit yeah but yeah so like how
3199260	3203980	prominent are they and how many like what's like per capita like how many of them are involved
3203980	3209740	in what's going on uh there are a pretty substantial number of of the forces like in the field uh it's
3209740	3213820	kind of hard to get numbers but you can get a picture for it just by looking at military
3213820	3218620	checkpoints because it's a mix of men and women working the checkpoints and doing like the job
3218620	3223740	of garrison duty and from that I'd guess somewhere around a quarter to a third um you can also get
3223740	3230380	an idea by one of the things so about 11 000 uh mostly Kurdish but also Arabic fighters and also
3230380	3236460	foreign fighters died fighting isis um and they call them the the shahids which means martyr um
3236460	3240940	and their pictures are all over the place pictures of different martyrs are all over the place
3240940	3245900	and quite a few of them are young women um there's a lot of women who are 16 17 years old
3247420	3253420	are there women in like high military status like yeah like like generals and so if you work in the
3253420	3259180	middle east in cover conflict you will run into a situation very often where in order to get into a
3259180	3264220	certain area or to embed with a military unit you have to sit in a room with a bunch of elderly
3264220	3268460	generals and drink tea with them and maybe have lunch with them until they're like all right you
3268460	3271740	guys can get in the Humvee and go on and do your thing they just want to like sit with you and get
3271740	3277980	sort of that face time with you and I had that meeting for the first time in Raqqa uh where the
3277980	3286300	person who was in charge was not a man and it was a woman in her 60s um who was a an older Kurdish
3286300	3292140	fighter probably former PKK who was one of the co-presidents of security for the city of Raqqa
3292140	3297500	and so she and this man were like running security for the whole city and she was from
3297500	3302380	the instant we stepped into the room clearly in control and nothing started until she was ready
3302380	3306860	to go and nothing stopped until she was ready for it to stop we've got her picture in here too
3306860	3312380	but I want to go back to this at some point um where that is this is your ramp your the
3312380	3320700	ramp you wanted yeah number three yeah so that's her um she's the she's the queen Elizabeth yeah
3320700	3329980	the titan yeah and she um and who's who's smiling jack over her that's her that's her partner and
3329980	3334460	when we asked him what do you think about all of this like women's revolution and feminism stuff
3334460	3339180	he was the guy who was like oh I'm totally about it and she just like laughed and waved her hand
3339820	3343740	and it was like clearly this like dismissive gesture like yeah fuck you we've been in arguments
3343740	3350380	together I know how you really fucking think dude um I mean yeah that's that's really interesting
3350380	3354700	like of all places you you would think that that would not be the place where women were
3355740	3360940	like controlled military and like governmental control yeah I want to there's a story I want to
3360940	3364220	tell really quickly just so I don't forget to do it if you want to go back to picture seven
3364220	3368700	there's a woman in the middle of that uh of that picture you see that young woman with the glasses
3369500	3374940	she was 16 years old when Isis took over the city that she lived in and one of the first rules they
3374940	3380460	instituted for women was that all women had to wear the niqab which is the full black uh uh like
3380460	3386140	full body covering and she went out one day with a white belt around it and a member of the hisba
3386140	3391660	which was Isis's religious police saw her and she was sentenced to 1500 lashes for wearing a white
3391660	3396780	belt and the way she described it to us is that's enough lashes that three different men had to
3396780	3402700	deliver it because their arms gave out and it took her four months to recover from the whipping
3402700	3407340	enough that she was able to move around and eventually escape through the lines
3407340	3412380	and reach the Kurdish controlled chunks of uh of northern Syria her there under the tree with the
3412380	3418140	gun on her hand yeah yeah with the glasses I can't believe that wouldn't kill you yeah it it can it
3418140	3424460	does a lot of the time but the number of women died yeah um so she reaches the Kurdish lines
3424460	3430220	and the first thing she sees is a soldier a young female soldier of the ypj holding an ak-47 and the
3430220	3434220	way she explained it to us is as soon as I saw that woman holding a gun I was like that's what
3434220	3440220	I want to do whoa yeah I mean there's there's this bitter sweetness to it because it's like
3441660	3448620	we in the west have been having this for 200 years of like and it's it's really hard to
3448620	3457180	unbrae it because it's like guns or penises and men are violent and that's part of the problem
3457180	3465980	and then but we also like these stories of like you know injustice becoming justice and like
3465980	3473100	equality taking the form of women holding these weapons of destruction and it's like it's the
3473100	3479580	mind just spirals and while the mind is spiraling one must then go why is your mind spiraling
3479580	3485420	because there are too many poles going on here like like get rid of them and achieve stabilization
3485420	3491660	and if you have to do that by I it's like whatever means you have to do that I mean if a person
3491660	3498220	took 120 lashes we we got different like so they give you sort of their war name so it always
3498220	3503340	starts with haval which is a word in uh karmaji kurdish that means friend or you might translate
3503340	3506620	it to comrade it's sort of like calling everybody around you comrade would have been back in the
3506620	3512620	early days of the soviet revolution um and her last name I have trouble pronouncing but it's the
3512620	3518700	kurdish word for revenge no shit yeah so like comrade revenge was the name that shows so this
3518700	3523660	this is post her being whipped 1500 times yeah and she's sitting there and looking like she's
3524540	3528700	like she was getting training at the issue is actually helping to train the younger women in
3528700	3535580	the unit so this was part of an all uh arab unit of the ypj um so these young women were all getting
3535580	3540220	trained to fight and it was like I talked to a number of them we spent like a sizable chunk of
3540220	3544460	a day there and we actually got I have a bunch of papers that I have to translate that's like their
3544460	3550220	coursework on feminism because it's a two-month boot camp and the first month is on historical
3550220	3554300	training and like feminist theory and like understanding like the relation of men and women
3554300	3557420	throughout the ages and like the birth of authoritarianism like that's part of the
3557420	3562220	military training along with how to shoot an ak-47 so okay well that's really interesting
3562220	3565820	yeah I don't want to derail but that sounds like a rabbit hole that's worth while like how does
3565820	3570540	their history of feminism rob scoot down over here so that the people can see all the photos
3570540	3575660	here like in case like it's blocking anybody um I mean when they when you so when if you're
3575740	3581100	I mean that's just like what history of feminism are they're getting a completely different one
3581100	3585740	obviously there's there's not they don't do a slideshow this is susan Anthony like they have
3585740	3592060	a completely different history yeah it's um it a lot of it does focus on like significant women in
3592060	3596620	both the history of the region and the world who they like see as sort of icons in this long
3596620	3602220	struggle a lot of it's the stuff that Ajalan wrote about his theories on when human beings
3602780	3608300	transitioned from hunter-gatherers to agricultural societies and when like the enslavement of women
3608300	3614940	on a systemic basis began okay coming to understand all of that god damn um yeah it's some surprising
3614940	3619820	stuff to encounter in the middle of the Syrian desert are they heralded and being like applauded
3619820	3626780	in like like their local areas for being women in power or being a woman militia some of their
3626780	3631580	parents uh they are disowned from and will not be going back home because their family didn't want
3631580	3636380	them coming in joining and some of their parents some of them expressed that like my family was
3636380	3640300	like yeah when I was a kid this would have seemed impossible but after ISIS they were just like fuck
3640300	3647500	it why not um so it was a mix but like will they ever be heralded heralded as heroes or are they
3647500	3653180	just going to kind of be footnotes like in a weird you know crisis there's um there's a kind of real
3653180	3658220	politique that you encounter particularly working with Kurdish forces in any part of the world and
3658380	3663020	I've been with them in Iraq and in and in Syria and they're both very different chunks and both
3663020	3668860	very different ideologies but they both understand how optics work um both like the Iraqi Kurdish
3668860	3672780	movements and the serious Kurdish Syrian Kurdish movements and so they understood from the beginning
3672780	3677820	that having female fighters up at the front line looked really good in terms of getting the US to
3677820	3682780	support you with airstrikes um because like that just sells back home a hell of a lot better than
3682780	3688620	the way to a man's heart as a woman with a gun yeah you can't argue with the effectiveness one
3688620	3695100	of the differences is that for the Iraqi Kurds um that having actual women in the front line
3695660	3700460	stopped being a thing as soon as the immediate threat of ISIS over running their capital stopped
3700460	3707420	being a thing and in Syria they're still all over the place um they're still running leading men
3707420	3712940	into battle like you would it was so comprehensive that it like because a part of you as a journalist

3717420	3722380	and um a certain amount of time after like looking back behind you and just seeing like a young woman
3722380	3727660	in a headscarf like going over maps with a guy like 40 feet behind you like where you're not
3727660	3730940	filming where you're not looking at and they're clearly trying to figure out where to position
3730940	3737100	their guys and whatnot um you just accept that it's happening and that it like isn't weird for
3737100	3742860	a lot of the people anymore now look if you've got a bunch of photos we can go through all of

3762780	3767340	talk about i know you want to that's the thing that impresses me about you is that you're clearly
3767340	3776380	passionate about that shit and have such an eye for it um but google rob evans um and scroll
3776380	3782380	past the kid stays in the picture um and the history of paramount doing porn and um and and
3782380	3788620	and see rob evans pieces about eight chan and four chan and and and the stuff and it's like
3788700	3798060	don't like it's like look it's not i i it takes 10 minutes and it fucking hurts like drinking
3798060	3805580	nyquil but then um right why is drinking nyquil hurt that puts you to sleep normal uh uh wheat
3805580	3811340	grass wheat grass it's disgusting uh but you feel a little better after you drink it like you're a
3811340	3816700	little more armed for for for something and stuff you talk about shit posting which i really didn't
3816700	3822860	know the definition of and all kinds of stuff but um we we we have guests coming up who are
3822860	3827180	delving into that area and we can have you back any time and if you've got a bunch of fucking
3827180	3831580	photos from your trip to seria let's go through them and listen to you tell stories yeah i get
3831580	3836060	like there's one spiel little spiel i'd like to go on about the domestic side of things that like
3836060	3840220	i talk about this i've been doing like i was on the bbc and npr and like doing a bunch of shit
3840220	3844060	after the last shooting because they call me up every time someone from a chan murders people
3844060	3848540	um and there's something i never get to talk about or i talk sorry get interrupted uh what
3848540	3853740	is eight chan i don't know is that is that is that two times worse than four chan if the internet's
3853740	3859260	asshole if the if the asshole of the internet had an asshole that's eight chan and it's actually
3859260	3865500	called eight chan developed to because uh child porn was banned on four chan and they're like well
3865500	3869420	we can't have this yeah well yeah i think it was popular as because of gamer grade but i think
3869500	3874140	that's why i was invented it's like we need a four chan to to trade chill uh child porn
3874780	3882380	yeah it was yes that's the starting point it's it's only got worse yeah they they took a real
3882380	3890540	nazi turn after 2000 like 14 um and it's uh it's stupid and it's sad but it's why like 80 people
3890540	3894860	have died this year um and there's a really important provocative cover i'm gonna let you
3895020	3901740	do your ranch in one second because i can already hear like from my from my wonderful like like
3901740	3907260	like audience that that like i i respect the hell out of them and like if i only think about the
3907260	3914220	stuff on the drive over here i i like i thought the same thought immediately when all this talk
3914220	3917740	about like we gotta pull the plug on eight channel this stuff and my first thought is like well wait
3917740	3922540	a minute that can't possibly be the solution and i don't want anybody listening to this podcast to
3922540	3931900	think that like um i it's just like your that's why i say go google rob evans read his shit this
3931900	3939100	guy as much as he's been in syria and iraq has been in four chan and eight chan and just read
3939100	3945820	the stuff because it doesn't it's not forcing you to do anything just read his stuff and and and
3945820	3955260	start to like understand uh uh uh uh the climate of and the definitions of what is when do you
3955260	3963020	start to call something an actual like fucking sell i and and i just like the fact that i have
3963020	3969980	to gingerly say that is like a sign of the crazy ass times but now do your thing yeah i mean i um
3970780	3976780	so i started covering eight chan in 2014 because i was a comedian at that point in time and i worked
3976780	3984220	for a website called crack.com that did a comedy video about uh personifying different websites on
3984220	3989340	the internet as like kids in a high school and it personified eight chan as this creepy kid
3989340	3995020	like hitting on uh another young woman in like a really creepy and abusive way and like that was
3995020	4000140	the joke is that that's the kid eight chan would have been in high school and they found the video
4000140	4003820	and they got angry and they didn't go after the director of the video who was a man they didn't
4003820	4008460	go after any of the writers of the video who were men they went after the actress and they started
4008460	4012700	like sending dead animals to her house letters written blood to her house like also this is like
4012700	4018300	2014 so i start like i just start checking in on these guys a couple of times a year just because
4018380	4025180	i'm like what the fuck is happening here um and in 2016 the president retweets a meme that they
4025180	4029420	create you guys saw that picture of um hillary clinton with like the star of david behind her
4029420	4034460	that says most corrupt candidate ever that was an eight chan meme so i wrote a thing about them for
4034460	4039420	the comedy website that i wrote for at that time and then i just keep looking in and then the
4039420	4044460	christchurch massacre happens and because i'd been working on extremism and stuff during that time i
4044460	4048860	read the guy's manifesto and i see that it was posted on eight chan and i like write a thing about
4048860	4054060	it like while the bodies are still warm and suddenly like all these journalists from legacy
4054060	4059660	media are being like can you explain the internet to us um and like that's why i'm in this position
4059660	4063420	but what i think is important for people to understand that i tell to every journalist
4063420	4067020	from a big station that talks to me that they never play they never put it on the radio they
4067020	4074380	never put it on tv this shit goes back further than the internet as we know it in the early 1980s
4074380	4079820	there was a terrorist group called the order which was inspired by a book called the turner diaries
4079820	4086540	which is a fictional book about a white race war that is sparked by like terrorist cells carrying
4086540	4091980	out like random acts of violence it's a fantasy it's a fantasy for white supremacists yeah who
4091980	4096220	maybe don't call themselves fascists blowing up enough shit and the terrorist group in the book
4096300	4099900	is called the order and the real terrorist group was called the order and they're protagonists or
4099900	4104220	antagonists oh they're the heroes they're protagonists like most yeah terrorist written
4104220	4109260	fiction it doesn't really have good structure because it's it's just like once upon a time
4109260	4113900	we blew up enough shit that we got to we got to pick which women we got to fuck and it was great
4113900	4120460	and then we nuked the year olds yeah um so this real terrorist group calls the call the order
4120460	4123820	starts up and they mostly rob banks and armored cars they only kill a couple of people but they
4123820	4128220	may go off with about four million dollars in cash some of it goes to buy rocket launchers
4130620	4135100	this part people know what people don't know is that most of the weapons that the money bought
4135100	4139660	got confiscated eventually the army and shit tracked him down the fbi figured that shit out
4139660	4144780	but a lot of the money went to buy apple two computers and early networking equipment which
4144780	4150940	connected kkk cells and new neo-nazi cells and like white supremacist readouts in places like
4150940	4156540	the area nations up in idaho on an early internet network called liberty net now this is in the mid
4156540	4164380	1980s by the mid 1990s there were researchers realizing there's an organized neo-nazi presence
4164380	4169500	on like usenet and shit like the early internet like on these fucking like uh what were they even
4169500	4175740	called not message boards like even fucking before news groups news groups um like dot politics and
4175740	4179980	shit like there's nazis all over these places and they start finding nazi manifestos written about
4179980	4184780	how to radicalize people on the internet and how if somebody confronts you the first thing to say
4184780	4189980	is i'm not a nazi use humor and jokes and try to claim that you're just joking if people call you
4189980	4194780	on like your ironic fascism and stuff and like if we just put this stuff out into the atmosphere
4194780	4201180	often enough this is how we can recruit people and so what we've seen what we're seeing with achan
4201180	4206300	and not just with achan but with like this broader constellation of like neo-nazis and fascists on the
4206300	4210540	internet who were radicalizing larger and larger groups of people and who sort of metastasized in
4210540	4216460	the 2017 charlotsville march where you got hundreds of these people in real life is the culmination of
4216460	4223500	30 years of really diligent work um and that's why i try to treat these people and have tried to push
4223500	4227660	the mainstream media and when i speak to law enforcement when i lecture at colleges try to
4227660	4232060	talk to them about you have to treat them as if they're like isis or al-qaeda and maybe they're
4232060	4236940	not that organized and they're certainly not a central figurehead of the group but they function
4236940	4241820	that way and they've been doing so for decades and it's time we acted like it yeah you have to
4241820	4250140	at least ask yourself in terms of group psychology what if these people weren't white now the brick
4250140	4255180	wall that i run into is like well how can you possibly punish a medium like how can and that's
4255180	4260140	what all of my friends also say too the minute we hear this stuff like we just go like well how
4260140	4266540	could pulling the plug on a fucking place where people get together and say who wants to mass
4266540	4274460	shoot how can pulling the plug be the solution um and just reading a couple of your your pieces
4274460	4282700	like started to nudge me over where because unlike me who's just simply a 46 year old dude waking up
4282700	4288860	and going yeah but at the end of the day but the i it yeah and and and that's why i say to you guys
4288860	4295660	like because i i i don't i don't presume anything about you guys in these turbulent turbulent times
4295660	4302220	like and i think that's that from reading two of your pieces that was one of the things i really
4302220	4310940	respected is your acknowledgement of the psychological effect of just shit yeah just
4310940	4319740	just too much information and how there is like like that is like if if we had if you hadn't been
4319740	4324780	to syria that would be an hour long conversation i'd want to have is like how in the hell what is
4324780	4331100	the responsibility of the discerning humanitarian individual when they're trying to figure out what
4331100	4339420	is the difference between shit posting trolling propaganda and an outright like thing to bother
4339420	4345740	attacking what is anyone supposed to do because it's obvious what the quote unquote enemy wants
4345740	4352860	to happen which is fatigue shock and awe yeah they want you offline they want you to do what i have
4352860	4359420	done right to buy a gun and get in your swimming pool and i am proud well i'm not proud but i am
4359420	4364700	not afraid to shamefully admit i've never seen they won i've never seen you in the pool though
4364700	4371180	with your gun that's the well man look challenge accepted these three first off this is off topic
4371180	4377660	but if you haven't gone pool shooting now dan i come from texas and rolling down a moving body
4377660	4382860	of water with a rifle that's some good times good times i'm not gonna pretend it's not i can't tell
4382860	4388460	if you're kidding i think i'm not kidding i'm pretty sure myth busters proved that bullets
4388460	4392540	don't work underwater well no but he's talking about tubing yeah which is something i've always
4392540	4399500	been doing lazy river tubing plus seat shooting right tube shooting that like i'm not a big gun
4399500	4405500	enthusiast but i would go tube shooting yeah who wouldn't who wouldn't possibly i would not go tube
4405500	4412060	shooting with you no i want to be completely alone yeah well they say about you know are they the
4412060	4416620	old saying of never be the smartest person in the room never be the guy in the tube shooting trip
4416620	4423340	that has the least experience with guns and tubing and or tubes yeah yeah to only go tube
4423340	4431340	shooting with navy seals rob like i i took uh journalism school at usc like in the early 90s
4431340	4438620	and i was i i think about like what it must be like now to go into a journalism school today
4438620	4445340	like because this is when i went there it was it was pretty pre-internet and certainly pre
4446140	4452380	napster like like like yeah i i was pre-napster for sure there's less focus on napster that's
4452380	4457500	heartbreaking but but like how do you approach journalism now and like like when you're writing
4457500	4464380	a piece and like you think of the market that's going to be delivered in like in a world of
4464380	4472140	just just fake bullshit and like like how do you approach print journalism today that's a reason
4472140	4476700	i'm a big fan of the site that i write for it's called bellingcat and these are the people they
4476700	4481020	were founded by a guy who was a something awful forums goon named eliot higgins and something
4481020	4485260	awful is also the forum that birthed achan which is the forum that the forum that birthed for chan
4486940	4491900	now um so elliot's just like this nerd on the internet and like when the syrian civil war
4491900	4495340	starts up he starts getting interested just like looking at pictures of conflict through like
4495340	4499020	google images and trying to piece stuff together and then he gets interested in like the fighting
4499020	4504460	in ukraine and there's been a number of stories that they've broken but one of them is that after
4504460	4510300	i think it was mh 17 um the malaysian air flight that was shot down over ukraine they just spent
4510300	4514780	god knows how many hours combing over pictures of the wreckage and pictures of russian troop
4514780	4520140	movements at the time to identify which missile based on the serial numbers on the missile
4520140	4525100	shot down the plane from like a russian buck launcher and then traced down like what launcher
4525100	4529740	that missile was put onto and then traced its path from russia into the ukraine to prove that
4529740	4533660	it was the russian back separatists in ukraine who shot down the plane and like that's the kind of
4533660	4539260	journalism they do um and i don't do that because i'm not nearly that smart but like that's i think
4539260	4544460	a part of how you deal with the problem of like well nobody believes in truth it's like okay well
4544460	4548460	you can put out this article where i'm not relying on trusting that you went here and talk to these
4548460	4553660	people i can pull up all of these images i can trace the serial numbers on this missile i can
4553660	4558220	like do all this myself because you've spelled out how you're going to do it and that's hard to
4558220	4563740	argue with like when we when we look at the internet i'm i'm using my i statements here
4563740	4570780	when i look at the internet and i go this is at least 80 percent nonsense it's worse poison yeah
4570780	4577740	um it might do me right to recognize that that's probably because i'm 80 poison and that if and
4577740	4584540	and that if i'm 20 decency or health that that what that means is that there might be 20 of the
4584540	4589500	internet that is decent that that you shouldn't expect those averages to be higher and that what
4589500	4594140	you and you should expect yourself to have to dig a little a little harder how would you teach like
4594140	4599980	if you you said you give talks and you you uh like how would you like you're talking to a bunch of
4601180	4606940	18 year old freshman in college that want to go into proper print journalism no i don't talk to
4606940	4612140	those kids um the the when i lecture i usually lecture to counterterrorism students and to like
4612140	4617740	new law enforcement federal law enforcement officers about dealing with uh particularly far
4617740	4621500	far right terrorism but in general with dealing with terrorist groups that use the internet to
4621500	4629420	recruit um i don't like i think journalism's kind of broken in the mainstream sense yeah the people
4629420	4633180	that you're talking to might be our actual journalists the people that actually go in there
4633180	4639660	and make like like on the ground reports and say this is what happened and this is why well but
4639660	4645020	also and here's one of the here's one of the reasons why i think mainstream and like most of
4645020	4650620	the field is kind of kind of screwed right now is that it has abandoned for sort of perceptions of
4650620	4657420	the way things ought to be it has abandoned actually mattering um and that's in a world where
4657420	4662300	somebody can just lie a thousand times to overwhelm your one truth it doesn't matter that you're
4662300	4667500	telling the truth what matters is finding a way to get the truth to reach people and sometimes
4667500	4673180	that involves thinking not like a journalist but like a guy who writes for television or whatever
4673740	4678460	how do you know when you write something and you've gone and reported on something and you
4678460	4685500	disseminate that how do you have any faith that that will even land as truth we have to be willing
4685500	4690940	to write a bunch of shit that nobody reads which i have uh and will continue to do until the day i
4690940	4698460	die um you also have to have an amount of faith in the fact that when people get scared they'll
4698460	4705420	pay attention to what makes sense and the lies always make a kind of sense but they're never a
4705420	4709820	satisfying sense when you really turn them around in your head and that's what you have to hope on
4709820	4713260	and that's something i believe on faith that's not something i believe entirely because of the
4713260	4717260	evidence of my own eyes because it's not always true do you have editors and publishers that you
4717260	4722060	trust that that they'll appreciate what you're doing and that they'll make sure that what you've
4722060	4728540	written gets out yeah i've been really lucky to work with good editors all my life um and i don't
4728540	4734220	know how journalists work with ones who aren't um you know my editor at bellingcat when i started
4734220	4739420	getting death threats and got that bounty put on me was like wait let's say what go back he mentioned
4739420	4746140	this yeah bounty please go over it but yeah i was on the after the christ church shooting i was on a
4746140	4752140	documentary for abc australia talking about 8chan and stuff and like they found it and they got angry
4752140	4758140	at it and they put a 15 bitcoin bounty on my head and it's probably a joke because it's 8chan but
4759340	4764140	that's the point yeah they could always say it's a joke yeah exactly you get shot they're like that
4764140	4769100	was my idea right so i reported it to the police and like my editor went to her contacts in the
4769100	4774220	fbi and like tried to get something then nothing got done nothing ever gets done um but like that's
4774220	4777980	the way like you know there's not there's also not much that you could do like one of the things
4777980	4782860	i do when you were saying your editor at belling yeah she like she like did everything she could
4782860	4786460	to get people to take it see her even though there's nothing that will be done about it because
4786460	4791180	she considers her job to protect her creatives yeah i shouldn't call you creatives i should call
4791180	4796060	you something else the thing that made me like almost break down a little bit after the um the
4796060	4802140	assassination of jamal kashoggi um was uh his editor uh karen atia uh at the washington post
4802220	4806220	and her reaction to it and you could tell like she's one of those editors who would like
4806220	4810460	take a fucking bullet for anybody like writing for her and like yeah you hope you work for
4810460	4817020	somebody like that yeah um it's crazy that like that now journalists almost seem like they're a
4817020	4824460	part of um like the intelligence service like like like you're you're basically not spies but
4824460	4830620	you're you're certainly putting yourself out in a real harm's way by simply caring about reporting
4830700	4837180	truth that now you that you like you can get poisoned murdered you know decapitated and all
4837180	4841660	sorts of horrible shit you know i think that's actually kind of always been the case in journalism
4841660	4846620	i think what makes this more on sort of this edge where we're actually dealing with live intelligence
4846620	4852220	rather than reporting cold intelligence is the fact that nobody including the intelligence agencies
4852220	4858060	understands the world right now um which is like a good situation to work in if you're somebody who
4858060	4862860	gets the internet three percent more than the guys working at the fbi because you're like
4862860	4867260	this guy's obviously referencing the yeah yeah you know you need to understand what
4867260	4872780	this and like a 40 year old guy is like wow there's a meme yeah i had like i had a time
4872780	4877020	where i was trying to explain like the um vermouth kabob meme and stuff which i'm not going to
4877020	4880460	explain here if you don't need it it's just a racist meme that was referenced by the christ
4880460	4885420	church shooter but like having to go through this like manifesto line by line and explain like
4885420	4891340	this is this in joke that these nerds told on the internet to each other um it's like it's weird
4891340	4897420	the amount again when you're going against entropy when you side here's i mean the thing that drives
4897420	4903580	fascism which is a modern invention uh you can't have an ancient fascist country unless you change
4903580	4910700	your definitions because you have like the tenets of fascism include like absolute nihilism and
4910700	4917820	manipulation of the media takeover of it uh that includes this idea of like you have to subvert the
4917820	4923420	very idea of truth which i see a thousand articles a day as much as i try to avoid the news i just
4923420	4930060	see news week the time the cnn washington post i just see i see a different permutation of people
4930060	4934860	coping with something that seems as a ninth grade history student to me to be the same headline over
4934860	4940220	and over again which is boy these guys really will stop at nothing to make everyone not
4940220	4946060	understand that there's an objective truth see i i think part of the problem is that um
4947100	4954300	fascists never tell the truth but they are often the most authentic players in the media atmosphere
4954300	4958620	and in the political space right this is something to bring it back to isis who i do think are i think
4958620	4963020	it's an islamo fascist movement just like we have crystal fascists here in the united states
4963020	4967100	you look at isis's recruitment propaganda and you compare it to the recruitment propaganda of the
4967100	4971020	united states military you watch a us marine corps recruitment video you're going to see cool
4971020	4975260	guys with guns cool uniforms you're going to see cool tanks rolling everywhere nobody gets shot
4975260	4980540	nobody gets hurt nobody's bleeding you watch isis's propaganda and they'll follow a single guy from
4980540	4984620	his journey leaving canada and like going to the islamic state and picking up a rocket launcher and
4984620	4989820	fighting to him getting blown up and it's zooming in lovingly on his like torn apart corpse on the
4989820	4995740	ground and that's the guy you're meant to be and people embrace it because it's authentic because
4995740	5000940	we live in this culture where everything is like so plastic and formulated and it was the same
5000940	5004860	thing that was explained to me i talked to this guy who's pretty sleazy dude rick wilson he's a
5004860	5009900	former republican political strategist and during the 2016 election i was talking to him about
5009900	5014300	political ads and we were evaluating trump's first campaign ad with one of hillary clinton's most
5014300	5019020	recent ads and he said everybody's making fun of trump's campaign ad because it's so like juvenile
5019020	5022380	and looks like some kid cooked it up on the internet that's going to do a thousand times
5022460	5026620	more for his campaign than anything she could spend 20 million dollars on because that feels
5026620	5031020	like something a kid cooked up on his laptop because he cared and it's the same thing with
5031020	5036780	isis's stuff it's the same thing fascists always have going for them is that they're lying about
5036780	5042140	everything but the emotional truth at the core of the movement speaks to something in people
5042140	5046140	and a politician who's just trying to get elected never can and you don't want to be distant from
5046140	5056700	that that i i there's a there's a i want to inculcate myself but also present the lighter
5056700	5060060	side of that which is like there was somebody that reached out to me through private messaging
5060060	5064380	where it said that they were a mental health professional and that they work with at-risk
5064380	5071340	kids and by at-risk i mean particularly the kids that are at risk of self-harm and um that
5072140	5078700	this person was writing to me to let me know that they put a quote from my show on the door
5078700	5085260	of their office at this center where these kids that are not privileged they're they're they've
5085260	5094380	sunk down by virtue of wanting to die to the to the lowest like drain gutter and they're coming
5094380	5101980	through him and he he liked the show rick and morty not community rick and morty which is very
5101980	5108620	nihilistic very like fuck it i i believe the quote was the thing that morty says to his sister which
5108620	5114380	is like nothing matters like nobody exists on purpose come watch tv which i did personally
5114380	5122220	right because i and i did design it to appeal to the potential runaway in all of us it is something
5122220	5131660	that i wanted to hear when i was 17 from especially an imagined kid brother and and um and
5131660	5137260	he said he said he put it on his door and that he was just reporting to me that it was like making
5137260	5144140	kids trust him and it brought me to tears as i got to tell my therapist i'm like i make this
5145100	5151660	shit that's like i just follow my heart sometimes my heart is dark and tortured and poisonous and
5151660	5157820	sometimes my heart is polyanna all this stuff but what you're talking about is like authenticity
5157820	5165820	the perceived authenticity of the message versus like when kids are attuned to the horse shit
5165820	5171100	so when i was young fight club was this biggie it was like it just spoke to me it was like oh my
5171100	5176220	god this movie gets it oh my god the corporate american all this stuff like anything that's
5176220	5181420	horse shit anything that goes through channels on its way to touch you no matter how it's
5181420	5187180	touching you it would be simpler to just reach out and go yeah like maybe there is no god
5188140	5192780	maybe maybe life means nothing like it's like i'm listening to this person first
5194300	5199420	god forbid they tell me to do something terrible because i'm i just can't i just
5199420	5204220	don't have time for this fucking pringles can over here like that's like oh sorry jeff i
5204220	5211660	didn't mean to personalize that that's an inside joke kind of thing but like that idea of like yeah
5211660	5217180	no this this contains no sucrose and this will eventually lead to your it sort of reminds me in
5217180	5220700	high school like the kind of battle that my teachers would tell me of like like at least the
5220700	5224620	way they characterize it like during the cold war when you're going to third world countries and
5224620	5230620	you're pitching them democracy versus communism and you're basically saying if you if you go with us
5230620	5237420	your grandkids are gonna maybe have a lot of bread like they can buy it at a supermarket
5237420	5244220	if you go with them everyone's gonna eat a lot more tomorrow and that was a mischaracterization
5244220	5250460	probably that conflict but it was like the paradigm like it it it cuts to that which is like
5251740	5258060	authenticity fidelity of messaging hey talking to you and i'm talking to you fucking straight
5259020	5264860	have you ever felt like killing yourself yes and then the other person is going like hey
5265420	5270060	talking to you oh didn't mean to scare you everything's fine obviously you've never
5270060	5277100	thought of killing yourself right no of course uncle henry and okay good night i'm gonna go
5277100	5284780	fuck your aunt irene and then drop dead freds over here i was like i'm gonna sneak out my window and
5284780	5292140	they're authentic it is i'm so glad you brought that up because it also is like it's the shit
5292140	5298060	posting thing where it's like people flooding a squirting ink there they go like here's my
5298060	5303900	manifesto define shit posting from me you you take shit posting is like sort of the tactic and it's
5303900	5307740	not like fascists or inherently right wing or left wing or negative or anything it's just a thing
5307740	5313260	that you can do to sort of flood a discussion or a conversation online with nonsense usually a bunch
5313260	5317420	of like meaningless memes or like stuff like in order to kind of distract any sort of conversation
5317420	5321900	usually not just nonsense but stuff that's like deliberately kind of emotionally provocative
5321900	5327500	in order to kind of derail productive it's kind of an inverted dog whistle and it's the example
5327500	5331740	that i brought up in the case of terrorism was how like the eight chan shooter had a bunch of
5331740	5336620	met like references to internet memes and stuff in his manifesto that like had nothing to do
5336620	5340540	with anything and also would bring up people like candace owens who he wasn't a fan of
5340540	5344060	but he knew that if he dropped a name in the manifesto would start like a right-wing left-wing
5344060	5348540	fight and he could like sort of get people talking about that as like while they were also
5348540	5354460	like charl Manson told his people go right right you know white people hate black people on the
5354460	5358780	walls after you stab someone with a fork yeah it's not a totally new tactic it's just this is
5358780	5363420	the term the internet yeah you just like sort of you're the grinch you're your oscar you're a fan
5363420	5369820	of entropy entropy is going to get you to where you want to be faster because order is not getting
5369820	5377340	you anywhere uh all right anyways uh also you have a new uh children's book coming out
5380540	5384780	it's it's called good night moon sorry you're broken into nine factional pieces
5385980	5390380	i was gonna go oh the places you won't go because the nazis have bombed the trains
5390380	5398460	the places you refuse to go yeah um do you have kids by the way good god no oh no no no so this
5398460	5402620	is a job that yeah that would make sense oh no i don't have kids because all the drugs can i ask
5402620	5409900	you a weird question if you did have kids how would you deal with that question because people
5409900	5419340	would like load like if you if you had kids would you stop no i uh i like i don't know i'm not a
5419340	5425340	parent so like my advice on this is is almost meaningless my my opinion as a former child
5425980	5433100	is that uh a retired child is a retired child retired yeah i yeah
5436460	5443820	aren't we all i love that i think you should let kids be interested in and read about and
5443820	5449020	study about anything they want i don't think you should necessarily let them watch anything they
5449020	5452380	want i mean that was the rule my parents had for me that like i'd have a lot of disagreements with
5452380	5457260	my parents but they were like we're gonna watch what you watch on tv but any book is fine because
5457260	5462220	at least he's fucking reading um and like i don't know if that works in the modern era because that
5462220	5465820	can mean like the kid winds up on fucking eight chance well that's right i don't know like is
5465820	5472140	there are we supposed to censor no you know i i think censorship of that kind never works which
5472140	5475980	is not to say that like taking a site like eight chan off the internet the way that it has currently
5475980	5480860	been taken off is bad because i don't think that censorship i think that's being like hey company
5480860	5484140	do you want your name associated with the site that's killed any people and they go like yeah i
5484140	5489580	really don't um but all that shit still you can post that like in a post net neutrality world let
5489580	5495740	them have lower bandwidth um yeah i think what the only thing that really works in the long run
5495740	5501340	when it comes to like fighting authoritarianism and fascism through raising better people um is
5501340	5506460	giving them a solid grounding both on like a one-to-one level and sort of the example you said as a
5506460	5511180	human being of how they should treat people by how you treat people and number two give them a
5511180	5515500	thorough grounding in history um which they won't get from school because like school history
5515500	5520140	educations are garbage so don't just tell them about world war two and the revolutionary war
5520140	5526700	talk them about bhopal india and the east india trading company like yeah um talking sounds like
5526700	5533820	vegetables yeah history vegetables you no wonder i were dying i'm not even willing to do this and
5533820	5540380	i'm the coolest dad that could ever live are you a dad now dad no i'm like you man i still
5540380	5547660	gotta fight to fight no i'm just lazy and i don't want to talk about bhopal i that's kind of the
5547660	5552700	problem because so i'm a hero for opting out of reproduction yeah that's that's an option that's
5552700	5562620	my syria yeah uh singleness i mean i yeah opting out's a fine a fine way to go i don't know i
5562700	5566060	i'm throwing a lot at you go back to what you were talking about i don't like oh fucking what
5566060	5571020	i will say you were saying earlier um like what can what what can be done to like fight this and
5571020	5577020	how do we actually fight it and like the answer is that um nobody if you want to have a world
5577020	5582380	where nazis don't regularly come back into power and kill a shitload of people and then they have
5582380	5587420	to be fought and then they get like beaten down for a little while and then 80 years later they
5587420	5591340	come back again if we don't want to have that world and we also want to live in a relatively
5591340	5598780	free and open society nobody gets to be just a comedy writer which i was for a while nobody gets
5598780	5604220	to be just a whatever you do uh nobody gets to be just a teacher or a hairdresser or uh a
5604220	5609420	construction worker everybody also has to be involved in local politics everybody has to be
5609420	5615980	an anti-fascist everybody has to put some responsibility on themselves to keep shit
5615980	5620780	from getting fucked up otherwise we gotta eat those uh we gotta eat those history vegetables
5621820	5627580	well we gotta we gotta eat those ideological vegetables yeah you know one of the one of the
5627580	5631500	problems we have right now in our society you look at some of the worst people who are currently on
5631500	5636780	sort of the side of the right that's pushing a lot of violence right now um and the people
5636780	5641500	often who aren't advocating it directly themselves but who are saying things like that 600 million
5641500	5645260	muslims are radicalized terrorists and then a guy who reads them a bunch goes and shoots
5645260	5651580	up a mosque in kebec city um that particular guy whose name i i won't mention here uh has an
5651580	5657340	has a screenplay that he just couldn't get sold in hollywood and steve bannon had some screenplays
5657340	5661660	that he just couldn't get sold and a lot of these guys who are currently right-wing grifters
5661660	5666140	stoking outrage against immigrants and muslims have screenplays that they just couldn't sell
5666140	5670940	have tv pitches they couldn't sell they're just failed screenwriters and failed stand-up comedians
5670940	5676060	a lot of them are failed stand-up comedians hey i'm sitting right here gavin you're a success you're
5676060	5682860	on a stage right now thank you proud boys founder gavin mcginnis couldn't quite hack it as a stand-up
5682860	5688860	comedian and dave rubin's the same case so they get into politics because it's easier and the
5688860	5694060	people who are really good at this stuff like a lot of them enough some of them succeed and the
5694060	5697260	ones who are decent people and don't succeed they go find something else to do with their time but
5697260	5703340	the ones who don't succeed and are shitty well there's i can just be racist and then i can make
5703340	5707980	a shitload of money being racist and using the same tactics i learned to rile up a crowd and get
5707980	5713740	them to hate immigrants um and they're focusing on politics because it's the only place that they
5713740	5718380	can make a living because they're not quite good enough to make us laugh it's like christian rock
5718380	5724220	yeah yeah yeah it's the evil version of christian rock it's like i know four chords yeah and i love
5724220	5732220	christ yeah a little i can either love learning chords so much that i learned six chords i could
5732220	5737260	double down on my love of christ if i hear if i hear if i hear any negative talk about striper i'm
5737260	5746060	leaving the stage nobody's talking bad about striper like it's the same i love christ i love
5746060	5757100	the christ i love christ two chords smoke on the water you know if if this rick and morty
5757100	5764140	thing doesn't pan out it should have been walking on water wait no notes
5767660	5773340	that's not so what do you mean it should be walk on the water i'm saying that song was
5773340	5778380	smoke on the water's cords right yeah but that's why i was supposed to say walk on the water after
5778380	5785820	the chorus yeah walk on the wall oh i could have yes i could have extended the bit yeah okay
5787740	5791580	and see dan if you become a grifter you never have to take notes again
5793900	5800540	i could busk well you're not gonna keep your lifestyle with that also i can't play those
5800540	5805740	three chords in any instrument i don't even know what chord means
5807340	5810860	well i out of curiosity what do you think a chord is
5812300	5820060	and i'm asking that not ironically like like it's a group of notes that harmonize together
5820060	5825580	i don't know they work they work together and there's several different kinds of chords
5825580	5830780	what do you think the difference between a major and a minor chord is well that it's through
5830780	5838940	the lens of a logic pro user the difference is that the middle line is either closer to the
5838940	5843580	bottom line or closer to the top it's you're flattening the third you're flattening one note
5844060	5848620	by half step yeah what do you think come at me bitch
5854380	5858860	what do you think a sus chord is i think it's a sustained chord generally
5860780	5863980	sustaining what well sustaining the chromatology
5866220	5872460	i don't know man where like fuck i don't fuck you what do you think what do you think the
5872460	5883660	overtone series is oh it was the the follow-up to downton abbey it was just a short-lived spin-off
5884460	5889420	the overtones they they were always that family that was like well i think the servants took the
5889420	5894700	wine get out of here maud and then they became the overtone are you more about the diatonic
5894700	5901260	or the chromatic you know i i'll i'll quote donald trump being quizzed about the bible and go
5901260	5906380	i think both equally remember that clip from him in the camp jay trial where they're like
5906380	5909900	what new testament old testament he's like both
5912380	5919660	so so close to a hero i i honestly like that how that's like bob robert's shit like like it's like
5919660	5927420	tanner 88 like fucking meta humor you know both can i be president now because if i can

6201260	6207020	humble bragged that i was collateral damage of fap gate or whatever the fuck it was because
6207020	6214700	because of various like people like and like i it's it's not it's truly i think what that indicates
6214700	6219260	you have like actual knowledge we could be like the young turks or like like some kind of like web
6219260	6224700	based news agency like we have a scoop here belling cat this basically means that her phone's been
6224700	6231260	hacked i to me that suggests what really freaks me out about that email coming in today is that i
6231260	6236460	almost posted she sent me you almost sent him five bitcoin because you don't really understand what
6236460	6241260	it's worth but you were an early adopter and i keep telling you you're a trillionaire well i i
6241260	6247020	think it was my 30th birthday at christopher's house and she was my day and we threw a prom
6247020	6253180	themed based uh birthday party and she came as my day i picked her up at the peninsula hotel
6253180	6257340	and she said i've never been to prom and so i went there and i got her corsage and she said i've
6257340	6261580	never done this i've only seen this in movies and so i pick her up and we go to the thing
6262380	6269020	and we took a photo together and then she sent me a photo framed in a sterling silver
6269580	6276380	like like you know kind of eight by ten size frame and i have that and right before i saw that
6276380	6285020	email from this clearly spammy bullshit i almost posted that photo and said like this isn't gonna
6285020	6293340	age well yeah you you should get rid of that every time i get like i on my computer i have
6293340	6299900	the guardian and i have uh Reuters that comes up right off the bat and it's all day pictures of
6300540	6307740	Galen uh standing next to Jeffrey Epstein exactly the years that like i knew her and
6307740	6313100	i have a photo where i looked like i am the i'm the young Jeffrey Epstein in that photo
6313100	6317180	Rob Evans i see your knees twitching do you have you're a conflict journalist do you have a take
6317180	6322220	on this the Epstein yeah the Epstein thing story i think you should get rid of that picture man
6322220	6325900	that's not going to be good in about three months we're going to take on his situation
6325900	6330620	but i have like like i have a fucking take on the Epstein thing i'm sure everyone does
6330620	6337980	60 40 i think 60 he probably just killed himself um okay so here's my apparently controversial
6337980	6345420	take which is like it doesn't matter like a suicide that unwatched is murder well every
6345420	6349260	suit you could make a case that almost every suicide in the u.s prison system and there's
6349260	6355500	a huge number of them is murder um wait but yeah but what are do you know statistics about
6356300	6363100	prisoners who are of such strategic uh significance that like like how often do they fail
6364220	6372380	this is arguably the most important arrestee in the history of criminal justice i don't know
6372380	6378460	how to exaggerate it well here's what i'll say the last suicide watch failing is murder he wasn't
6378460	6386220	on suicide watch he wasn't he wasn't on so maybe that was part of the plot maybe they took him off
6386220	6390140	it's uh the last time i'll say this the last time there was a prisoner who was like this high
6390140	6397020	profile was lee harvey oswald and they didn't do a great job there like it wasn't a bang-up
6398460	6404460	his was on camera yeah yeah um yeah well here's the thing here's a funny little
6404460	6412380	question to raise about suicide watch yeah my neighbor's doorbell records my dog taking a shit
6414460	6419340	what's with these stories that come out from federal penitentiaries of the most
6419340	6427260	notorious uh potential witnesses like like well we'll we'll tell you what happened later like
6427260	6433820	like wait you can't put a little bubble gum size the fact that he either committed suicide or was
6433820	6441180	you know aced uh it was the day that gallane uh all of her like this trench of uh of documents
6441180	6447500	came out about him and her involvement and that's the day that he kills himself that's either him
6447500	6452140	going oh fuck it i don't want to get involved in this steve steve leevey just sent me this link
6452140	6456620	it's in the new york times where uh the staffer on guard duty before it happened it was like
6456620	6460940	i was the guard on duty when my shift ended a new guard came i'd never seen him before i said
6460940	6464860	what's your name and he goes steve and i said steve what and he looks around for a second then
6464860	6472460	said maybe my name is steve jail i was tired in that same legit steve jail that's the person who
6472460	6479660	would have been on guard duty when he died steve jail holy shit from the new york times fuck holy
6482460	6488300	is the wwf you would you want to come out and confirm this at least hire somebody who went
6488300	6493340	through ucb to come up with a better name he didn't he didn't get that job by taking improv
6493340	6500620	classes that's what it says that job description says do you own piano wires i i'm steve mothica
6501260	6506460	yeah i'm steve murderer i'm steve prison i don't want to i want to interject and say i don't want
6506460	6510300	to make light of a fucking murder because if that's what it is i also don't want to make light
6510300	6515820	of a suicide if that's what it is i i but it's so high profile and it's like there's questions
6515980	6521980	rule of law here like i just don't understand like when you arrest a guy who has a safe with
6521980	6527660	a bunch of diamonds and a passport that's fake and it's like an alternate identity in saudi arabia
6527660	6534460	and everyone agrees i have this like i i imagine being this guy in a box and going like fuck man
6534460	6540940	i never thought in a million years that trump would be president because i think he thought
6540940	6547100	he had all his bases covered and was like if it ever goes wrong with the democrats i got every
6547100	6553420	republican in the world on my side and then he never foresaw the one thing that would fuck him
6553420	6561020	completely which is the republican party being hijacked by so much uh reality tv celebrity
6561020	6567100	that he's like ha i'm in this cell i've done it before i'll do it again i have literally everybody
6567100	6574620	on my oh shit everybody there's not a single person in this world that's gonna stop me from
6574620	6580220	being murdered now i don't know man i um like he had he he was also pretty deep with with bill
6580220	6585980	clinton yeah that's what i'm saying i think if you boil it down so is galaine galaine was like
6585980	6591260	i'm saying he was deep with clinton and trump and he didn't think trump would be would become
6591260	6596700	he's like he's like hey i as long as i just keep on keep this rolodex up i i think you're
6596700	6602700	making not the same mistake he made but in terms of where you're looking here as to his mistake i
6602700	6605980	think you're making the same mistake he made which is that he looked at the top it's very flattering
6605980	6610780	what he did not pay attention to were the people at the bottom and what brought him down
6610780	6615500	was not trump becoming president what brought him down was a mix of two police detectives
6615500	6621180	who didn't care that it was the end of their career to follow this case and a really really
6621180	6627420	dogged journalist at a local paper in florida who stayed on the case like a fucking pit bull
6627420	6632540	and wouldn't let it go so you've read about this yeah that's why fucking epstein is dead right now
6634380	6638300	and the story and this is one of the things that i think is so fucked up about q anon is like when
6638300	6642540	people imagine the pedophile conspiracy that they think is at the center of world government they
6642540	6647580	imagine like five-year-old kids being sacrificed by satanists in the basement of a pizza place
6647580	6652540	and the actual conspiracy that we have a huge amount of documentation what actually went on
6652540	6657980	is that a bunch of rich powerful people around the world wanted to fuck high school girls
6657980	6664700	that's the whole conspiracy they weren't six they weren't 10 they were usually 15 to 17 years old
6664700	6668620	that's what jeffrey epstein provided that's what all these billionaires and millionaires and
6668620	6673900	presidents and senators and members of the royal family wanted like teenagers what wondering like
6673900	6681660	like you know weird flex but okay right right before like the day before jeffrey epstein kills
6681660	6687180	himself uh asking friends of mine that were like we all met galland and we all hung out with her
6687180	6691420	and she's quite fascinating and she's a very interesting woman and and like you know
6691420	6697740	multi-lingual and just like like awesome like wait like was she totally involved with this
6697740	6703820	and i think like like all this paperwork came out all these documents came out like
6703820	6710460	that would really have affected jeffrey epstein and trump bill clinton uh the sultan of bernay
6710460	6717740	prince henry uh all this shit it's and then he's dead and well so that's so rob evans
6717740	6725260	do you think ockham's razor says suicide this is one of those situations i think ockham's razor
6725260	6731900	applies to things that uh you have some precedent for i'm not aware of a situation in which a guy
6731900	6737900	who had a sitting president a former president the sultan of bernay a member of the royal family
6737900	6744700	several sitting senators most of like the man a guy named gary jail yeah and gary to make sure
6744700	6752540	he doesn't kill himself so like is it possible jade get his name right sorry what do you say is
6752540	6757180	it possible he was murdered fucking of course he pissed out like he a lot of people had a vested
6757180	6761420	interest in him dying so yeah there's a real good chance he was murdered is it also possible
6761420	6765980	that a guy who had only ever lived like as the richest one of the richest people in the world
6765980	6770700	and who like was used to having ever whim catered to was broken by a few weeks of prison and just
6770700	6776140	decided to end it because he couldn't take it sure well but he i mean he did it before he made it
6776140	6780540	before yeah yeah but that was a real fucking different story well i mean it was a different
6780540	6787260	story especially now that it turned out this way he he was he was looking at like like basically
6787260	6791660	a life sentence my thing is about rule of law because if you like what now we're all focused
6791660	6798620	on this autopsy and i'm like who cares if the autopsy says it like yeah big fd like remember
6798620	6803900	like you could you could go into this guy's cell and i'm sorry i'm you must be frustrating you
6803900	6808780	but because i'm like i'm like oh imagine the fucking i'm like the liberal q anon but i'm
6808780	6812060	like you if you wanted to kill this
6814380	6819820	detainee like like it it is as easy as literally like
6821500	6827580	sliding open a thing at his cell and going like my name is steve jail
6829660	6836780	i am never going to come into that cell like you know what to do right that's the thing i it's like
6836780	6842700	it's like like like when he when a person is in that dire straits actively not keeping them from
6842700	6848540	killing themselves is murder regardless of conspiracy what i think you you might be dancing
6848540	6855420	around um is that is that there was a failure to protect one of the most powerful pawns in the
6855420	6860140	history of chess that's not the story the story is that if you want someone dead and you want them
6860140	6865900	dead by their own hand the easiest way to guarantee that is make them be a normal a normal
6865900	6872300	prisoner in a u.s maximum security prison because that'll pretty much do the fucking job for you
6872300	6878060	but he he was in the new york uh it was it was a new york federal detention facility but he was
6878060	6883980	in it he was like alone in a cell right alone he wasn't you're almost describing like the threat
6883980	6889260	of being thrown into general pop i get that what i'm also describing is being isolated i i if i
6889340	6894460	apply what i would assume my aakim's razor is to that is that what you said is that he said
6895020	6900700	fuck it i i i've been i've been in jail since early july and i'm looking at being in jail for
6900700	6906460	the rest of my life and he just said the first moment i'm alone and it's our job to keep these
6906460	6912860	people alive i i'm outraged about jeffrey dommer dying in prison like i don't like there is some
6912860	6918220	it's like we have to like call like like we we have this like attitude about bad people in our
6918220	6923020	society where we're just like lock them away and i hope they get raped to death and i hope they
6923020	6928620	die i hope they kill themselves yeah zach do you got a beat can i i want to hear mc steve jail
6928620	6933660	no stop it like steve jail don't do it even as a joke i want to hear what you have to say can i
6933660	6937740	bring this around seamlessly to something that ties it back to the original topic and is also
6937740	6944540	uplifting oh yeah so i'm in fucking syria and i'm talking to these guys i mean no i know uplifting
6944540	6948940	when i hear it so i'm talking i'm talking to these guys who have been all of these people
6948940	6953580	men and women who have like just been dealing with this brutal war against isis and the last
6953580	6959420	survivors of the caliphate they have in a prison well it's part prison camp part refugee camp
6959420	6964300	there's 71 000 people not all of them are isis survivors but a lot of them are and they've got
6964300	6969100	them locked in this camp and they're trying to figure out what do we do with them and one of the
6969100	6972940	first things that happens is they start trying to send a lot of these people back to iraq because
6972940	6976860	a lot of them are iraqi in origin or that was their port of entry and as soon as they send them
6976860	6980860	back they do with a bunch of french fighters and france says we're not going to take these people
6980860	6985580	fuck them they're not french anymore and iraq hangs them same day that's just what they do in iraq
6985580	6993260	and so far not so uplifting not uplifting yet the rojavan constitution says the death penalty is
6993260	6999580	illegal you cannot kill a prisoner under any circumstances it's not okay so they stop sending
6999580	7005420	prisoners over to iraq who are isis fighters and so i'm talking to these people i'm trying to
7005420	7009660	understand because me and my partner jake we both had reported from the fighting against isis and
7009660	7013420	like in my case at least i've been shot at by these people i've also spent hours and hours and
7013420	7017020	hours talking to people who've been tortured and beaten from them had family members killed
7017580	7022060	and i'm sitting in like i start by talking to like one of the women who's planning out their
7022060	7026060	criminal justice system and like trying to build this thing from the ground up to be more equitable
7026060	7030460	than the one in syria which is not exactly a super hard story but like they're trying to like
7031180	7037420	do a better job and she's like no you can't you can't like revenge is is a sign of weakness and
7037420	7041980	revenge is also something that has been endemic in this part of the world in particular for centuries
7041980	7045500	and it's part of why we have so much violence as one member of this family kills another and they
7045500	7050460	kill a member of their family what we have to do is rehabilitation and so like at first i'm talking
7050460	7054700	to this lady who's in like we're in a nice like office room while she's like dealing with isis
7054700	7058300	prisoners and stuff and i'm like well you're used to talking with the press there's a good
7058300	7062700	chance you're putting on a show for me so we get down to the ground level to this actual prison
7062700	7066940	camp where they're keeping all these isis detainees and we start talking to their guards to these
7066940	7070540	people who have like i talked to this one woman who was telling me a story about how the day
7070540	7076140	before she'd been with this isis bride and her kids and the bride had knocked her down and her
7076140	7079740	kid had one of her kids had bitten her on the arm and she showed me the bite mark where this
7079740	7082940	kid had like ripped through the skin of her arm with his teeth and like the other kid had gone
7082940	7087420	off to try to get a gas can to pour gasoline on her before like her other comrades had gotten
7087420	7091340	them off and i'm like what do you want to be done to these people and she's like the only thing we
7091340	7096540	can do is try to rehabilitate them is try to treat them well and take care of them and like
7096540	7100860	eventually hope that it gets through to some of them and like particularly get through to their
7100860	7106540	kids because that's all you can do is try to rehabilitate people and be better than the people
7106540	7110780	before because if we just start killing them because we don't think they can be fixed then
7110780	7115820	we're exactly the same as the doshies as isis and then i start talking to the other guards these
7115820	7119580	like young men with ak-47s about like what do you think should be done and they all have the same
7119580	7125180	like we we have to try to fix these people we have to try to help them because otherwise
7125980	7130860	like this is fucked otherwise this whole region is fucked if we can't get past all this violence
7130860	7135340	everything is fucked and for a little bit of like perspective when i'd been in mosall at the end of
7135340	7139740	the fighting i'd been talking to people who had gotten like had like fled the city during the
7139740	7143660	fighting against isis and i would ask people what do you plan to do when you get back and
7143660	7148540	almost everyone's answer was well this neighbor of mine went with isis and he informed on me and
7148540	7152940	that's why i had to leave town or why my car got taken away or why i wound up in prison so i'm
7152940	7157340	going to tell on him to the iraqi authorities and stuff and it was like this cycle of violence being
7157340	7162460	perpetuated and all of the curds we talked to in the arabs we talked to at this camp who were part
7162460	7168060	of this thing going on in rojava were like you can't fucking do that anymore it has to stop
7168060	7175660	somewhere so we're going to try to stop it and that to me was the most uplifting thing that i
7175660	7181180	saw there and we spent some time with this group of older women who were like part of a neighborhood
7181180	7187580	council who were doing like the kind of what cops do in the united states like the the civil side of
7187580	7191980	law enforcement so they were the elected representatives of this neighborhood and they would
7191980	7196700	go around and one of the things they did is when there was a murder obviously you solve the murder
7196700	7201180	you try to solve the murder and you try to get the murderer in jail and it's usually pretty obvious
7201180	7205500	who's done it but you also have to deal with the fact that there's two families that now hate each
7205500	7210140	other okay and so you have counseling sessions between the two families where you try to figure
7210140	7216460	out what the family of the murderer can give the murdered in order to try to set things to write
7216460	7220460	and you like sometimes it's months of dealing with these conversations and at the end of it they
7220460	7224860	throw a big feast between both of the families and everyone else in the area so that everybody
7224860	7230220	sees this beef getting squashed so that there's public shame on the side of whoever it is if
7230220	7235100	another family starts up the vendetta again then everyone knows they're the ones breaking the peace
7235100	7240860	this time and this was like at the undergirding of everything that they've done and so i'm talking
7240860	7246060	to these old ladies about like the fact these women who had lived 50 60 years under the syrian
7246060	7251660	regime not able to hold a job not able to have any role in governance and who are now acting as like
7251660	7257740	their own local government for their neighborhoods and i asked them could you ever go back to the way
7257740	7263100	things were before and they're like oh no they'd have to fucking kill us and later that night
7263820	7270380	my uh my fixer habat takes us to the graveyard at the end of the day and that's um you can see the
7270380	7275420	graveyard on picture five and i want to show that because it's it's kind of noteworthy so these are
7275420	7280780	the way they do graves in that part of the world every single grave you can see is a garden so they
7280780	7285900	plant flowers in all of the graves so that like every grave is a sprout of life and as we're
7285900	7290620	walking through this graveyard which is all soldiers in this who died fighting the islamic
7290620	7296300	state we're walking and we're talking and my fixer habat is explaining to us how this justice system
7296300	7300780	works and the important she believes should be placed on rehabilitation and how you can't just
7300780	7305100	try to hurt people you can't just kill these people even though they've killed your family
7305100	7311260	you have to try to keep him alive and rehabilitate him and right after explaining this we're walking
7311260	7316140	through this graveyard and she stops at a grave and kneels down and kisses it and says this was
7316140	7325900	my brother he died fighting isis at the age of 17 in 2014 so like that to me was the thing that
7325900	7331900	was like hit me like a fucking bullet um that somebody can have an experience like that which
7331900	7337260	should be a generator of so much hate and it can in the proper environment and with the proper
7337260	7342300	amount of hope and with you know an acceptance of the realities of the situation take from that
7342300	7351980	that things can still be better yeah and then literally grow a flower thank you all wait give
