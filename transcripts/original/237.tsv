0	16080	There we go. Welcome one and all from Hollywood, California at Meltdown. Comics nerd melty
16080	28920	theater. Harmon Town is now in session.
28920	35480	Be alarmed that I'm not wearing a tie tonight. It just seems we're going to get loose.
35480	55160	Speaking of loose, let's bring out Spencer Crichton. Oh shit. Solo cups down. Speaking
55160	65320	of tights, let's bring up Mr. Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harmon Town. Thank you. Thank
65320	74760	you. Thank you for coming to my show. Thank you for coming to my show. Thank you. I know
74760	81240	you could have done something else tonight, but you came here instead and you paid $10
81240	94280	that means a lot to me. Oh me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
94280	109000	I really thank you. I'm full of gratitude for you. Also, I should mention special vocal
109000	115720	guest Jello Biafra tonight. That was fantastic. Not familiar with his style. You sounded just
115720	126760	like him. Yeah. I mean, I think our guest tonight is he's a writer and he wrote a movie. I'm not
126760	131080	introducing him yet. It sounds like an introduction, but he wrote a movie. I was just watching an
131080	139560	iTunes. It's the Stanford prison experiment. It was a, and so, it's a feel good film. I think just,
139560	143320	I think just talking to him about writing and talking about that movie and, and, and all the
143320	147480	thoughts about that is like enough. Like I don't need to babble too much. I don't have anything
147480	151000	that wouldn't fit within the context of a conversation with him. I say you and I and
151000	156440	Spencer, we catch up briefly. We talk about where we're at. Do we do business? Well, I have a look,
156440	160200	we have some businesses to talk about. We have some important business. I haven't picked up my
160200	166680	gun yet. Right. 10 day waiting period has turned into two months of normalization on my part.
166680	170280	Apparently I'm normalizing. So someone's going to break into your house and you're like, Oh,
170280	174600	Jesus Christ. I got to run the Burbank ticket to that gun store. It would be the story of my life.
174600	180920	I had, I had Batman security cameras installed all over my house. And then, and then I was part of
180920	185560	some weird loss. He says Batman security cameras are like, like they have little bats on it. Like
186440	191800	the underoos of security cameras. And then I was, my mailbox was part of some Los Feliz wide,
192760	200200	wet bandits, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern mailbox rating where some two guys wanted to look at my
201560	206200	piles of furniture catalogs really bad. And also I could have had them on camera. I could have,
207000	213320	but whatever. Yes, of course, someone's going to break in before I get my gun. So I don't get to
213320	223800	deliciously shoot them. But in a pre Trump universe, if somebody was just like breaking
223800	226840	into your house because they were poor and needed the money, you probably would just say, Hey, like
226840	230760	take what you want. But now you're going to feel like you're under a under siege. I think it's more
230760	235240	like in a post Trump universe. I would, if it's someone's breaking in, I'm going to go, are you
235320	245240	just poor? Like, like, like, like, are you just out of food and money? And I'll wait for a yes.
245240	249000	You've just told everyone, everyone that listened to the show how to break into your house
250120	255320	without being shot. Well, I've got the timber of your voice is going to matter. You better,
255320	259160	you better be able to fake a very authentic Latino sounding.
259160	266920	That's you. You're not allowed to be offended by that because I'm saying I won't shoot you.
268120	276840	If you're Latino, that's the opposite of racism. It's reverse racism. It's fantastic.
278440	281240	If you sound white, I will fucking pop a cap on you.
281240	290360	And yeah, and white people don't act like you don't sound different when you're coming through a
290360	301320	window. White people come in your window like this. Can I have a cup of sugar?
303240	307480	Anyways, black people come through your window. It's in the way that you use.
307800	310920	They love Eric Clapton, black people.
312520	320280	Enti? Okay. Enti nodded. All right. All right. Where was I? Where was I?
320280	322920	You were saying that all Latinos are poor and white people are rich.
327160	335880	Saying that our brothers of a different color are under threat and in a post-Trumpocalypse universe,
335880	341320	my gun has been purchased for the sanctity of guarding my Danadu.
344760	353640	Not so much from the hoi polloi as from the the the the the assertors of a newfound fascist state.
356600	359880	You have no desire to go scoop up this gun and take it out because I've been like, well,
359880	364520	he's not doing very good at taking over everything. He's having a bad time. He seems to be doing as
364520	371320	badly as I would do. He's very grumpy and he's self-destructing and it should I don't think the
371320	377160	gun will be needed to protect my home because I think that the ice caps will melt. I think I
377160	381880	should go shopping for a canoe paddle before. What would you have to see on Twitter or here in your
381880	386120	news alerts that made you get right into a car and get to the gun shop? I would have to see CNN's
386200	394600	Brian Stelter would have to say, uh, another great day, uh, uh, uh, Trump aisle.
397400	401880	Yeah, the leader is good. The leader is all. Yeah, like I just, I'm keeping my eye on the
401880	406440	journalists, the journalists, the activists, the, you know, the prominent folks, like I'm,
406440	412680	I'm keeping my eye on certain buoys. If I see them go like this, I'm like, okay, the jaws shark is here.
412680	417720	I don't know. I gotta go pick up the gun. What are we talking about? I gotta, I'm gonna,
417720	422840	don't worry kids. I'm going to get my gun. You just told a million, a couple million people that
422840	428360	you're currently unarmed at home right now. And if you, and if you ask for sugar, you can go right
428360	435000	through the window. You just fucked that up. You just, I know if you ask for sugar, you're white
435000	441720	and I will fucking kill you. Oh, well, okay. You told Latinos that they could ask for sugar and
441720	447000	go through the window. They could put on a nice fucking it up. No, if you're white and you don't
447000	455240	want to get shot, go, I, when you're coming in the window, if anything, I'm trying to, yes,
455240	461720	and his fucked up racist point of view. I'm here. I really haven't gone too far tonight.
465240	471240	I'm not going to be, it's fucked up to like what you do. You antagonize and you sabotage.
471240	475880	It's fun to fuck with you. I try to get up here and I try to speak my mind and try to share my
475880	479960	thoughts with people and you're like, what about this? What about that? And I'm like, what are you
479960	483720	talking about? What are you talking about? And then I try to explain myself and then you're like,
483720	491960	aha, like am I your enemy? These kids need wisdom. They need to know what color they're
491960	497800	allowed to be if they're coming in my window. The answer is less than white.
501240	517480	I mean, I'll, I'll let the audience handle that one. I think it's, I think it's more embarrassing
517480	521640	the amount of time someone said less than white. And then I went less than white. And then the
521640	530680	whole audience went wow. My white audience was like, oh, bingo. We are, we are institutionally
530680	542440	racist. Yeah. Less than white. You know, what are you going to do? That's how we see the world.
542440	547320	Fragility. I was talking, we were talking about tonight on the ride over here. The fact that the
547320	553720	thing that made me buy a gun, the thing that I have in common with the people that we would probably,
553720	559560	I'm assuming most of us liberal would, would, would associate with our so-called enemy on the
559560	563720	other side of the political spectrum. The thing we have in common, the thing that I have in common,
563720	568760	speak for myself, is like fragility. The fact that I experienced things not going my way,
568760	573560	and then I went and bought fucking hardware that puts holes in people because it was like,
573560	578200	no matter, no matter the Algores and dangling chads and the whatevers and the primaries and
578200	584440	all this shit, I had the luxury of going like systems. And then I, and like something real
584440	588520	happened that made me actually think this is going to change my schedule. This is going to
588520	593160	change how I have to behave next Tuesday. I'm going to be held accountable to something. And
593160	598680	I went and bought a gun. It's called fragility. And it's, it doesn't matter how right you are,
598680	603240	how wrong you are, how smart you are, how logical you are. It's like, it's a thing that's associated
603240	607960	with privilege. You've been privileged. You're more fragile. You, you, you're going to be more
607960	615000	reacting to things that are on a smaller scale than somebody who's maybe put up with shit that,
615000	620440	you know, that, and had to like be desensitized to it and realize that, well, oh, there's a pick
620440	625160	your battles thing or whatever you would call it. And it's like, that's what we're learning firsthand.
625160	629240	All of that talk, all that white privilege, all that stuff that I would like, I would get offended
629240	633800	by it. It'd be like, well, wait a minute, hold on a second. It's not logical. See, there's nothing
633800	639080	logical about it. It's like a gut reaction. You find out what you're made of how, and it turns out
639080	646920	to be glass, beautiful, pristine fucking sugar glass. Uh, as soon as something goes, goes wrong,
646920	650680	that like fucks up with, you know, fucks with your picture of the universe. I bought a gun.
650680	657400	I turned into a fucking Sandy Hook truther. I, I, I, like in terms of my behavior, I was just like,
657400	661560	I want my, yeah, we should have, there would have, we could have seen some bodies if that really
661560	669240	happened. Right. I, we, we have, we've waited this long to share with you something. No,
669240	677480	you already like me. It's too late. Uh, I have to say, you've already signed up on Spencer.
677480	683240	He's a Sandy Hook truther. If there's any person in podcast history that could maybe get you to sign
683240	689000	off on that, it would have to be Spencer. Spencer talked long enough, like five minutes, I'd be like,
689000	696600	all right, maybe I guess why, why was that corner acting so weird? Uh, I did, I went down
696600	701320	a Sandy Hook hole today because I was listening to true crime podcasts and then there was like
701320	705000	mention of Sandy Hook and then there was like reference it when Sandy Hook happened. I didn't,
705000	710520	I was like, I was probably like, it was probably doing community and I was probably also just like
710520	715960	the gross, like you don't want to know about it. Like most of us, but now it's like interesting.
716040	722440	It's like the magma's cooled and the stakes seem so much higher in this different spot. And it's
722440	726680	like all these things are like, so from a true crime perspective, Sandy Hook gets mentioned and
726680	732200	I started like, they started mentioning like the thing I just started the today of all days. I
732200	737000	like went through, I was like, what was all that business? Like why were people thinking it was
737000	742120	fake and what was going on? And as I was going through it, I thought it was really interesting
742120	749800	to note that like, it wasn't just like, it was like, you had to be a whack job to, to, to,
749800	755000	to think that it was fake, but you also, excuse me, I burped. You have to, you also had to be a
755000	762200	whack job who was absolutely convinced that Obama was like Hitler. Like he was gonna, he was gonna
762200	769080	get you. He was gonna, you know, and I, I would personally speculate that that absolutely, given
769080	775560	the total lack of empirical evidence that Obama was out to get us, like I have to, I'm sorry to
775560	780520	play this card, but I have to assume you're little itty bitty racist. If you really thought from the
780520	786680	moment that he got inaugurated, that you're like, shit's going down. Because if you weren't, if you
786680	791640	didn't have that lit, I think it comes down to that. I do also think it came down to something
791640	797720	other than emails, why you were choosing with all your logical fucking things of, you know,
797720	800440	all your speeches that you made about why you're voting this way and that way, you know,
800440	804760	your very salient points about the status quo and how to shake things up and all these things like,
804760	808040	yeah, you don't like the vagina, you don't like the black people.
810200	815800	Because I think there's other ways to rebel. But what am I gonna do? What am I gonna say to some
815800	821160	kid who's like, stir things up? But I just thought it very interesting looking at three-year-old,
821160	829000	like, cooled obsidian, like, like people freaking out and recognizing the distorted shape of myself,
829000	837400	like, seeing people that were so hysterical, that were so convinced that they were living in the
837400	845240	end times, politically, that in the very real moment of a two dozen children being massacred,
845960	853880	that they would actually, that politics could interfere that greatly with your fundamental
853880	861160	human need for empathy. That you would actually just skirt around it and start actually,
861160	867480	you would rather just live in an alternate universe. Because I don't think every single
867480	872920	person flocked towards those YouTube videos that are all the first thing that comes up when you
872920	879000	google Sandy Hook, I think those clicks aren't all the result of mental illness. I think you have
879000	884280	to be pretty mentally ill to like, put a lot of arrows and things and freeze frames and do all
884280	888120	the things that the people that were presenting the videos, but then there's people that they
888120	893960	wanted it to be true. And the rhetoric about the, oh, the occupier in chief, and oh, he just wants
893960	897800	this, and he wants that. They were living in this Wizard of Oz, where there was a wicked witch,
897800	901240	and we just got to get to the emerald city of the truth, and we got, everyone's going to get
901240	904280	what they want, as though they're trying to take away, we're just going to throw the bucket of
904280	908760	water, and we got to, I just, they're just not really acknowledging the fact that what they're
908760	917400	doing in the present moment is haranguing the parents of murdered children. And I, it's like,
917400	922440	we're feeling that way right now. I am feeling that, that way. I'm feeling the way they're feeling.
922440	926920	That doesn't mean that I'm as crazy as them. It doesn't mean that I'm as wrong as them.
927640	933640	But it does mean that we have the ability to fucking, like, just abandon all,
934920	942600	everything that makes us good. And when we get excited, when we get righteous and stuff. And
942600	947800	I was like, looking at my, at my reflection in that twisted wreckage, and I have no point to any of
947800	952840	you. So, so I was already feeling depressed, but now you're telling me, plus, on top of that, get
952840	957880	over myself? What are you telling me? I'm not saying that. I'm just saying, like, I don't know,
957880	961800	man. I also, I watched this documentary with this guy, Darrell Davis, who's like the guy,
961800	965720	did you guys see that? It's like, I can't remember what the title of it is. He's like a guy who, like,
965720	972040	he befriended, he's a black guy that befriended Ku Klux Klan people, like, for years and years.
972040	976440	He's been like, that, I don't have enough time to talk about, you should watch that documentary,
976440	981080	find it on Netflix or whatever, and, and sit through it, because he kind of, it's like, there's
981240	985800	a, there's a point like 45 minutes in where you're kind of like, I get it, BB King played good guitar,
985800	992600	but like, like, it, it, it's like, it, it starts, it's, it feels a little bit at a certain point,
992600	997240	like, like for the first half, like your things are being repeated over and over again. Then he
997240	1004840	goes to Baltimore, and, and like he, the shit is just happening, like, like crazy shit. So there's
1004840	1009400	millennial activists, millennial black activists sitting down at a table with him, after you've
1009400	1015720	already watched the, the polite whimsy of him sitting down with leaders of the KKK and skinheads
1015720	1020040	and all these things, and you take from it what you will, and then he goes to Baltimore, and it's,
1020040	1026840	it gets fucking balloon animal, like, it's crazy. Like, like, you just, you walk away from the whole
1026840	1032200	thing, I will warn you a little sad. I mean, because it's like, fuck, we're all fucked. But,
1033000	1038120	but, but it also, it's like, it's not like, like, like, oh, just watch this documentary about how
1038120	1043240	we're all fucked. It's more like, watch, like, watch this documentary about Darrell Davis that,
1043240	1049800	like, it puts so much shit under the microscope. I've talked enough. And I've talked enough. It's
1049800	1056120	my show. Fuck you, people. You haven't begun to talk. This is, this is your night.
1057800	1061880	I'm obviously a little buzzed or something. I don't know. If your next, if your next breath
1061880	1065080	was going to be bring in our guests, I was going to bring in our guests. Can I, can I, can I
1065080	1069320	interject one little thing? Yeah. For those of you who have been wondering that, well, whether or not
1069320	1075320	the three of us, uh, or this show would never get back to a D and D or a Pathfinder role-playing
1075320	1083000	game. We decided not to. We decided Dan's race monologues were enough for you.
1087800	1091320	But today we've actually generated characters. We're not playing tonight,
1091320	1096200	but we, we, we have, we, we have, we have a whole thing coming up. It's going to start. It's going
1096200	1099800	to be a doozy. There was a little clerical error. The characters we rolled were less than white.
1102840	1108760	We're going to reroll some stats and, uh, and make them as much as white.
1113640	1114360	Oh boy.
1117080	1120360	I want this episode to be called less than white just to see what happens for you.
1121080	1128520	For your, for your, for your career. I mean, if, if, if my ironic, uh, based in reality,
1128520	1135720	because I'm a generation X, uh, foot foot and mouth, uh, asshole racism is that if we have a
1135720	1140440	crucifixion of me, just, just do it next to the white house. That's all I ask. Just like,
1141160	1146360	just, and just put racist above my head. Like, like, and, and, and just like, I just demand,
1146520	1151640	everybody just fucking like spit on my corpse. And, and, and I, I just want anybody that works
1151640	1156360	in Washington to be like, what did he do wrong? Well, he was racist. And I just want that person's
1156360	1161800	lunch to change because they're going to be like, he was right. Fuck.
1164760	1168760	I heard his podcast. He got a little tipsy sometimes, but Jesus Christ,
1168760	1172120	I'm an actual, I get out there and really did a hard racist work.
1173080	1175240	I did like a whistle stop thing. Yeah.
1177720	1180680	I bought, I bought a weird hat. I sewed some things on my shoulder.
1180680	1187800	I dressed as R2D2 to leave a town hall meeting, uh, under the auspices that it was early trick or
1187800	1193880	treat. Um, all right. So our, uh, our next guest is an all around screenwriter TV movies. Uh,
1193880	1198840	like I said, his, uh, the most recent thing I was watching, maybe he's done more than this recently.
1198840	1209880	Let's talk to him and find out. Please welcome our new friend, Tim Talbot.
1219400	1223960	Uh, I got your name right and everything, right? Like I didn't, I'm a bad interviewer. Just,
1223960	1228520	I don't know if I told you that backstage. I'm a bad interviewer, but, but, but bad interview week.
1228520	1235480	Okay. Good. Good. Great. Great. Um, so I'm going to put a pin in like how you got started.
1235480	1240360	Cause I think your first job was South Park, right? Like the first, yeah. Like real kind
1240360	1244760	of professional job. Well, I mean, before that, I actually got hired to write a TV movie for MTV.
1245400	1248360	Oh, okay. Um, Hey, Tim, I'm sorry. Just, just cause audio here. Get,
1248360	1252440	get right in that microphone. So we had to write in there. Okay. Yeah. Um, yeah. But like the,
1253080	1267560	um, the first real sort of kind of professional, um, for a network job was for South Park. Yeah.
1267560	1270840	Like you, uh, what did you send in the script? Now I said I'd put a pin in it,
1270840	1275400	but now I'm talking about it. So you know, actually what happened was when I first moved
1275400	1279960	out here and right out of college, I, um, became friends with a lot of people that were people's
1279960	1285160	assistants. And one of them was a woman named Amy Cohen, who was George Clooney's assistant at
1285160	1290200	the time. And George was like one of the guys that sent out that first spirit of Christmas
1290200	1297240	tape to everyone. Yeah. And so through her, I met Matt and Trey's assistant. Um, and then just for
1297240	1301720	like a couple of years, I was like in their group. So I was going to all their parties and all that
1301720	1307400	kind of stuff. And, um, so they never read a word. It was like, Oh, that guy's funny. Bring him in.
1307400	1312360	You're clearly confident enough that you didn't insert any fake, like, and then I won a talent
1312360	1317400	contest. No, it was just like, I hung out with those guys at a party and that's the way they
1317400	1323320	ran their room. I, I, I, everyone's story of like, if you're paying your rent with writing,
1323320	1329800	you're one of the fortunate ones. Then people ask about your origin story. How did you go from being
1329800	1335960	Tony Stark to having this whole thing with the Jarvis and everything that like, and the answer
1335960	1342040	is never as satisfying as, well, I got blown up by my own shrapnel and I had an awakening of the
1342040	1349080	spirit that was brought to me by a magical person that was less than white in a cave. Um, like you,
1349080	1354040	we never have that story. We don't, we are not able to impart to them. How do you use to, you cope
1354040	1358040	with that really well. Cause you just told the story that was like, I ran a, I turned, I turned,
1358040	1362680	I turned right on a green light and I slipped in a man appeal. Well, no, before that though,
1362680	1367240	I actually, um, you know, I, I, I wanted to be an editor when I moved out here. I went to film
1367240	1371880	school and, and, uh, editing was the only job that I could stand. Like everything else was just,
1371880	1375480	you know, you can't ever write what exactly what you want to write. Cause you went to film school.
1375480	1379320	Yeah, I did. So how did you know, did you do, when they teach you editing in film school,
1379320	1386040	did they teach you that it's going to be like, there's a person behind you over your shoulder
1386040	1391400	that isn't, that is impossible. They're just teaching you the crap. No, they literally,
1391560	1395480	the thing that was really kind of cool about the school I went to was that, uh, day one,
1395480	1400120	it was like a very much like a tech school. So here's a camera, go start making shit. Um,
1400120	1404440	and then I found that in the process of making shit, it was so frustrating. We couldn't get
1404440	1408840	good actors. We couldn't, you know, the, the cinematography was never what you wanted.
1408840	1412360	And then you finally get to the point where you have to edit your film and there's a pile
1412360	1417560	of shit you got to make into Shinola. And, um, for me, that was like as creative as writing.
1417560	1422520	Right. Um, so I, yeah, I'm like one of those, I'm sorry, you became a, uh, you, you got into
1422520	1426600	editing after being asked to be a director and a filmmaker. And you said, no, I just, I just
1426600	1430760	prefer the editing part or well, pretty much like when you're in film school, you do everything.
1430760	1436840	Okay. And, and part of my whole thing was that I figured out that, um, if I'm going to be a director,
1436840	1441560	um, I have to know the limitations of everyone else's job. So you crew on everybody else's movies
1441560	1446920	and, and you just kind of come to, to like what you like. But with editing for me, it was just
1446920	1451560	everything about the process up until that point was such a disappointment that finally to be locked
1451560	1455320	in a room and just be like, well, now make this into something that you are not ashamed to show
1455320	1461080	to people was cool. And then when I moved to California, uh, I moved out here with like 20
1461080	1465320	bucks in my pocket and one friend from college and I might as well have stayed on the East coast
1465320	1469880	because I couldn't get my foot in the door anywhere. Um, and then I figured out that the
1469880	1474920	only thing I could do without being hired to do it was to write a screenplay. Right. And, um, you
1475000	1480280	know, I just started writing and got wrapped off the first screenplay. And, and, and, and luckily
1480280	1485640	I also met a trust fund kid from New Jersey who wanted to be a producer. Donald Trump. It was not
1485640	1491240	Trump. Um, but he basically paid for me to learn how to write. So I wrote three scripts for this
1491240	1495880	guy before I ever got hired for anything. That sounds familiar. I mean, I, I feel like I, yeah,
1495880	1503160	we, we, we airbrush our backstories. Like I, I could get really specific about my path from
1503160	1507640	Milwaukee to Los Angeles. It does involve like little like low rent benefactors who are like,
1507640	1512440	like, like there's like, it's, it's always very molecular and granular anyways, but, uh, but it's
1512440	1519640	never, it's never a satisfying thing to say to a kid who's saying, how do I get where you are?
1519640	1523880	Tell me. And you can never give them a straight answer. Well, there is a straight answer to that.
1523880	1528600	And that's just don't leave. I mean, literally the people, you know, if you, if you literally
1528600	1532600	just keep doing it, don't leave where you don't know. I'm saying if you come to California and
1532600	1536520	you want to be a writer, you come to California and you keep writing and sooner or later you're
1536520	1541240	going to get in. Right. Don't there's no, there's no easy path. It's always a catch 22. Yeah.
1541240	1545000	That's what, you know, it's default to like, well, okay. Yeah. You just, you're going to have to
1545720	1550920	like writing so much that you'd be willing to do it for 30 years and then get hit by a bus and die
1552680	1556200	because I don't want your blood on my hands at the end of it. And
1556200	1560520	I got to a point where I would have been fine doing that. And then all of a sudden I got lucky.
1560520	1565880	All right. Anyways. Uh, but, but, uh, so, so, uh, we can talk about the early days of South Park
1565880	1569480	later, but I kind of want to get to the Stanford, uh, prison experiment thing. Cause I, I just
1569480	1575800	started watching that movie. I, I, um, the, the, so, so I asked you in the green room,
1575800	1579960	maybe we'll retread and we'll pretend I'm asking you for the first time. How accurate is this movie?
1579960	1586360	Go 85%. It literally is. It's, it's one of those things where, um, as I was telling you in the
1586440	1591640	green room, um, for years they were trying to make this story and, um, Hollywood in their,
1591640	1597400	their wonderful way, always like the story wasn't enough for them. They wanted to make it into more
1597400	1601080	and make it into the stakes have to be life and death. It's got to be, have like huge emotional
1601080	1606680	stakes. You know, an earlier draft HBO was going to do that Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to that
1606680	1611400	was about a guard and a prisoner that were best friends. And there was a girl on the outside and
1611400	1616440	a weird love triangle. And it's like, what the fuck is this? You know? And when I first got
1616440	1622280	approached to work on the project, my, I was completely, um, um, I didn't believe it. I didn't
1622280	1625560	take any psych classes in college or anything. I knew nothing about it. And I'm just like, there's
1625560	1630200	nothing you can do to me. It's going to make me believe after three days that, uh, you know,
1630200	1634760	a classroom with fake bars on the door is a prison I can't get out of. And, um, it was only
1634760	1638840	when I dove into sort of the research with doctors and Barto that I realized, holy shit,
1638840	1643720	this is fascinating and this is human. This is like a real thing. So Bartos, the guy that ran.
1643720	1650040	Yeah. He's the guy that he does not come off heroically in the movie. Not at all. Um, uh,
1650040	1654680	but, but, but, but at the same time, it's like, you could say the same thing about DiCaprio
1654680	1658280	as Howard Hughes and the aviator. He does not come off heroically and yet,
1658920	1665640	but he does have a lot of urine. He's, he's a, he's the genius who thought of this experiment.
1665720	1668920	And one of my favorite line in the movie, this isn't really a spoiler. I think this gets to
1668920	1673240	the crux of why we all heard the phrase Stanford prison experiment in high school
1673880	1681720	is, but it was like, everyone's arguing about what's going on. There's talking about the
1681720	1686440	relationship between two guys. One's a prisoner, one's a guard, and then the Zimbardo character
1686440	1692840	is sitting back in his hot curled hair and his, uh, boogie nights suit. And he, and he goes like,
1692840	1697320	guys, guys, you're missing the larger point. The point is that the two guys you're talking about
1697320	1702840	were separated by a coin toss. And that really was, that's why we continue to refer to the
1702840	1708840	Stanford prison experiment. It's not because it was immaculately scientific. It's not, it is,
1708840	1715240	it was, if anything, totally dramatic and fantastical. It was, they, they, they didn't,
1715240	1718680	they didn't set out. I always pictured, I was telling you in the green room every time I heard
1718680	1724440	about the Stanford prison experiment, which for anyone who's, you know, the headline of it that
1724440	1728040	you hear about in high school is, okay, they did this college experiment where they took a group
1728040	1732840	of volunteers. They made some of them randomly guards. They made some of them randomly prisoners.
1732840	1739640	And what happened over time very quickly is that they fell into roles of abusiveness that transcended
1739640	1743960	any rules that they were given. The guards were abusive to the prisoners. The prisoners were
1743960	1748840	abusive to each other. Every abuse, abuse, abuse, abuse, it all happened, even though it was all a
1748840	1759080	big game. It just happened for real. And even as the movie represents, it spread upward to Zimbardo
1759080	1765000	who started acting like the prison warden started becoming paranoid about one of the escaped
1765000	1770600	prisoners coming back to, but you know, like he began, he, he himself became part of the experiment
1770600	1776920	because it wasn't science, it was art. And it was, but it was very valid art that you can refer to
1776920	1784520	very scientifically when you say, yeah, but circumstances fuck you up. If you're deprived
1784520	1792600	of your freedom in any way, you are, you begin to behave like someone that is not free. And you
1792600	1799000	start verifying all of these negative expectations of yourself. If you are given privilege and power,
1799000	1805640	you start overreacting to threats to it because you think that someone dropping a pencil means
1805640	1810120	that you should go fuck yourself. And then you, you start seeing the merits and coming down hard
1810120	1815640	and drawing a line in the sand. And it starts with guys going, why am I talking so much? You're on the
1815640	1820200	show. What did you, what was your process like when you getting this job? Like, I want to hear
1820200	1823960	about the, like, how much, how much reading did you have to do to write this screenplay?
1823960	1828600	Well, I had to do a lot. I got all of, you know, we had, you know, Zimbardo's life rights
1828600	1832840	and he was open to us. So I got to talk to him whenever I needed to. I interviewed him and his
1832840	1838200	wife together and separately. He sent me all the original paperwork from the experiment that they,
1838200	1841240	they documented everything. I mean, everybody, that's one thing, you know, there's so much
1841240	1847240	happened in those six days that you can't put it all in a movie. But one of the things they did
1847240	1851960	is they had a standard set of questions that they asked all the prisoners every day. And you could
1851960	1855640	just see them, you know, through, when you read this stuff, it's fascinating that they are being
1855640	1861720	dehumanized. And even there's a bit in the movie where they're asked to write a letter home after
1861720	1867160	two days, and half of the kids signed their number and not their name. Right. Because it had been
1867160	1871000	drilled into them so much over the pre the previous couple of days. Because they thought they would
1871000	1874600	get rebuked because their mail will be gone through and they would like they get in trouble
1874600	1877560	for not doing that. Well, they knew their mail would be gone. No, they knew it would be gone
1877560	1880840	through because they were not allowed to seal their envelopes. They had to hand them back. So
1880840	1884840	they were going to be read. So they became a number just in case. Yeah, I think it was just
1884840	1889800	more that that the indoctrination of the first couple of days, really started to work on them
1889800	1894600	when you're referred to as a number and not a name, over and over again, and you're sleep deprived,
1894600	1900040	and you have to like, rattle off your number 1000 times a day, it was just easier, it became sort
1900040	1905880	of their identity. Sorry, Dan, you worked and met DiMardo. Oh, yeah. And what's his like, how
1905960	1911400	does he look back on this? And what's it like having this re hashed through? Well, the good
1911400	1918440	thing about him is that he absolutely 100% owns it. You know, he's like, I realized I fucked up,
1918440	1922840	I fucked up by making myself part of the experiment. Right. And it really took you know, I mean,
1922840	1929640	if you've seen the movie, it took someone from the outside coming in to really say, Hey, you're you
1929640	1934200	guys are totally fucking up here, you have to stop this. Because nobody else saw it. They just saw,
1934200	1939000	wow, we're getting a really cool. This is a real study. It's we're getting real information and
1939000	1943720	didn't realize that they were hurting people in the process. But now wait a minute. I mean, and I
1943720	1948440	confess, I forgot about a Harman town meeting that was happening at my house. So I haven't actually
1948440	1952280	watched the end of the movie. I haven't seen spoilers. I haven't gotten to the third act yet.
1952280	1958680	The story we hear in high school is the experiment got out of control. But much like Frankenstein's
1958680	1966280	experiment, mythically, the the thing that made it a disaster is the valuable thing about it. I
1966280	1971960	mean, he does Zimbardo. Does he look at it as like, yeah, that thing I did that was like
1971960	1976760	groundbreaking? Or is the whole thing just a cautionary tale and a Korean tragedy? I think
1976760	1980680	it's closer to that. I think that one of the things is that when you first start reading about
1980680	1985960	it, not talking to him directly, it's got its own life out there. He's got his own like media life.
1985960	1991960	And the media and reporters and stuff had built him up to be this guy that designed this
1993160	2000040	experiment to generate that response. Where the actual fact was he didn't expect anything from
2000040	2003480	this. This was no different than any other experiment that they've been doing at Stanford.
2004360	2008440	Other than the fact that it was a 24 hour day experiment, it was going to go for two weeks.
2008440	2011800	What kind of data do you think he thought he was going to get? There's a clear point in your
2011800	2018120	narrative where it's like, oh, shit, this is and then the eyes get big. But what kind of data in
2018120	2024440	his mind, like, I think, well, part of the Navy was one of the were one of the people that funded
2024440	2030360	the experiment. And they wanted to know what, you know, kind of mental effects incarceration would
2030360	2034280	have on people like in submarines. How are they going to measure it, though? Like, would they're
2034280	2038920	going to have them recite the alphabet at the end of each day? And would I think a lot of it was just
2039160	2044840	that daily the daily questions that they had to answer. Okay. You know, how much did he go in with
2044840	2050200	did he have like a sociological point to prove going in like he thought he might be able like
2050200	2056040	you ever see the seven up documentaries, the seven, seven and up. You watched the beginning that you
2056040	2061240	kind of feel like he was going in trying to prove class things, then it turns into something very
2061240	2064920	different. Did you think he came in with a sociological point of view on this? Or he really
2064920	2072200	just said, let's just get raw, unadulterated data. I think he just basically wanted to see what,
2073400	2077880	you know, basically what he learned from it, I think, is what he was looking for, which is how
2079000	2084440	the environment can change people. You know, he constantly says, you know, the whole idea
2084440	2089160	about like prisons is there are no bad apples, they're just bad barrels. So if you have an
2089160	2092440	inherently, you know, because all these kids were inherently good, they were all screened to be like
2092440	2097160	all American, you know, normal kids, they all went from the movie. There's one Asian guy.
2097160	2101880	There's one Asian guy. Is that based on reality? Were you guys? Yeah, that's based on reality.
2101880	2107880	So was that just a sort of, was that the, when was this the 60s? This was in 1971. So was that
2107880	2113240	just sort of like, oh, black kids aren't college kids. Was that, what was at play there? You know,
2113240	2118040	I honestly can't tell you, except that this took place in August of 71. So I would say in Stanford
2118040	2121800	at 71, that might have been a good representation of the student body. But these weren't Stanford
2121800	2125320	students. Not all of them. Some of them were. Some of them were. But it was just an ad place in
2125320	2129000	the paper, but it was during the summer. So a lot of kids that were still there for the summer,
2130040	2134840	came in and interviewed and they interviewed quite a few people to find the 24 or whatever.
2134840	2140200	But did you, sorry, I kind of, I kind of railroaded your answer. Did you, the faces that we see on
2140200	2147320	screen and the ethnic spectrum that they represent, is that? That's accurate. Okay. So there was like
2148120	2153960	one Asian student and then one of the, well, obviously, Carlo Prescott, the guy that they
2153960	2160840	brought in to advise, was a black man who was in prison for 17 years before this. And then one of
2160840	2165640	the, one of Zimbardo's grad assistants, the grad students was also a black guy. Yeah. And he
2165640	2170520	initiated, yeah, I mean, it's interesting. Yeah. I mean, the more would be spoilers, I think,
2170520	2174680	because the narrative, like it's like you, as, but you, you already know the real life story is that
2174680	2180280	the experiment got out of control. But what I've always felt about hearing that, because I've
2180280	2186680	probably referred to the Stanford prison experiment a thousand times in 20 years when talking about
2186680	2193800	politics or anything, talking about particularly fascism is like, well, you, it's a successful
2193800	2200760	experiment, not from a scientific perspective, but from the fact that someone once did this thing
2201480	2207800	and it changed the way that experimentation could be done in colleges now. I mean, literally,
2207800	2212120	it's like they didn't have ethics committees back then, you know, so ethically, this thing
2212120	2216520	was one thing with like the whole, the department of justice or somebody at some government agency
2216520	2221720	reviewed this whole thing. When you say it that way, you're, you're, you that's, there's an
2221720	2229000	unspoken supposition there that the information that came out of this experience was completely
2229640	2234360	not valuable at all to future generations. No, it absolutely was. It was just that they found
2234360	2239560	that the methods in which they did this were harmful. But if the, yes, I mean, yes, it's,
2239560	2243720	is there a way to do that properly? Is there a way to do an experiment like that without hurting
2243720	2248920	this, the, the subjects? It doesn't seem like probably not. Right. But they didn't know that
2248920	2253800	at the time. Well, I mean, well, it's more, but the thing is, I mean, in the movie, as it reveals,
2253800	2258600	it's a very organic process. It's like he set up a situation. He thought that the glibness
2258680	2264600	of it, the, the thing that I always pictured was like this, like, like you said, Jeff, you said,
2264600	2269800	like a set of an Elvis number where it's like, like you pictured Stanford, like shelling out
2269800	2274440	for fake prison cells. I picture jailhouse rock where there was four tiers of dudes dancing. And
2275640	2281480	if you can't find a partner, the story takes place in a hallway of Stanford college on summer break,
2281480	2287240	where a couple of offices, they carved the doors out, put bars in the doors. And, but some people
2287240	2290520	were in charge of when the doors were unlocked and when they weren't, and they had burlap sacks
2290520	2296040	that were like dresses. There was a, there was a deliberate attempt to feminize, which in 1971,
2296040	2300680	was the equivalent of this, the Zimbardo actually laying it out, saying, yeah, someone questions
2300680	2306760	it goes, feminize. And he's like, yes, to remove everything that they are, he's saying, you know,
2306760	2312680	there's an unspoken thing there. It's like this, the going waist deep into this thing and himself
2312680	2318600	becoming infected by it, becoming the warden, what losing his mind, to the same extent that
2318600	2325000	Sigmund Freud injecting cocaine into his own arm, like did yield some shit. I mean,
2325000	2329960	this is important. It's important. No, it's definitely important. It just, again,
2329960	2333800	now, ethically, they would not, you would not get this past any college ethics board.
2333800	2339080	But it's like, but there's a case where ethics, which are the things that are being
2340040	2347240	looked at. Like the reason we get lucky, if we become really good at conducting Stanford
2347240	2354120	prison experiments, we're not getting accurate data. Right. Like, we're not, we don't want to
2354120	2360200	become really, really good at making sure no one gets hurt during the Stanford prison experiment.
2360200	2366360	We want to, well, again, accurate data is that if you conduct one, you become fucking Hitler
2366360	2373320	overnight. If you are, if you put yourself in the position of judging what you're measuring
2373320	2380840	and if the people that everyone is intoxicated instantly by fascism, by hierarchical thinking
2380840	2386760	and like answering to a higher calling, everybody dresses it in different ways. I'm here for my
2386760	2392120	$15 a day. He's looking at it like I'm going to publish a paper on this. He's not even sure what
2392120	2396280	he's drinking. By the time he's drunk on it, he's seeing images of students punching other
2396280	2405080	students. And he's thinking, I made this happen. This is a live thing. And so again, the paranoia
2405080	2410200	comes in where when like the family members come to visit, he's terrified. One of them is going to
2410200	2416440	pull their kid out, you know, to the point where there's a really great scene that Billy Crudip,
2416440	2422440	who plays Zimbardo in the movie, handles a, um, sorry, some, some, some crud heads here.
2424200	2428680	No, no, we got credit. We got big, big Zimbardo fans. They come, they come to, they come to every
2428680	2434120	podcast. They want more Billy Crudip information. Unlike tonight, we always have to disappoint them.
2435560	2441640	No, here's Monica. Um, one, one thing I will say about Billy Crudip is he has a,
2441640	2445000	like the sort of like a monologue at the end of the movie where he pulls the plug.
2446280	2452120	We shot everything else before that. So all these kids have been working together for two and a half
2452120	2457400	weeks. And he walked in on his first day and delivered like his last scene in the movie. And
2457400	2464680	it was like, holy shit. This guy's good. Were you on the set the whole time? I wasn't I was, I was a
2464680	2469400	writer on Chicago fire for a couple of years. And we were, I was shooting an episode at the same time.
2469400	2473880	So I was going back and forth between here and Chicago. Now, is it true that the experiment,
2473880	2478600	the Chicago fire, uh, uh, uh, writing room, didn't you guys set a lot of fires in Chicago?
2479880	2488200	No comment. Absolute power corrupts. Absolutely. I want to look, I want to look at, uh, uh, because
2488200	2492920	you, you, you've got a bigger career than that. Like we can talk about what it was like. So you
2492920	2496920	were at South Park from the beginning. You were saying, you're like, I was there for season five
2496920	2506440	and six. Oh, all right. Well, those are the worst seasons ever. Uh, no, but it sounded like just
2506440	2509240	because of the way you're describing, like being friends with George Clooney and all that stuff
2509240	2514680	that you were there on the very ground floor. But, but like, what was it like in those days? Well,
2514680	2520600	like, were you full time? Yeah, well, I was a staff writer. So the way that they work, um,
2520600	2524520	by the time I got in there, their process had gotten to a point where basically Trey Parker
2524520	2530120	was writing and directing every episode. Um, and so they bring you like on a writer's retreat at
2530120	2534040	the beginning of the season, you know, like we went up to Whistler and we'd ski half the day and then
2534040	2541400	sit in a room and you know, your, your only real job was to be, um, um, attentive to the media and
2541400	2544840	like what's going on in society. So we'd sit in a room and we'd spit ball stuff. And then all of a
2544840	2550200	sudden we'd have like five or six ideas for shows and we come back to LA and, um, in order to get
2550200	2555400	the show done on time, they had to generate eight pages of script a day. And so Trey would go off
2555400	2558920	and start these scripts. And then whenever he got stuck, he'd call the writers in and we'd just sit
2558920	2562680	around, you know, you come in, they buy you lunch, you sit around a big table with some of the funniest
2562680	2567960	people you've ever met and you laugh until your face wants to fall off. And hopefully you throw
2567960	2572680	something out that ends up in the show. And then, you know, two days later it's on television, you
2572680	2577480	know, which is amazing for animation that we would know. I've had friends and Dan's had friends that
2577560	2581800	have worked on that show throughout the years. Who was there back in those days that we might know?
2581800	2589160	Well, Trey Parker, Matt Stone, um, never heard of them. Um, Kyle McCullough, uh, David Goodman,
2589160	2592600	um, Glasgow Phillips, hack, hack, hack. No, I'm kidding.
2595800	2601000	Nancy Pimentel was there for a little bit. Um, she was there for, I worked with her for,
2601080	2608440	she's big with Krita fans. Yeah. Um, the, yeah, well that corroborates greatly with every,
2608440	2611640	we do have a couple of friends here and there and the show's been on so long. Almost everybody in
2611640	2616680	LA knows somebody that worked on South Park at some point. That is the legend is that, uh,
2616680	2625240	that you, you, there's almost a feeling of guilt at how much Trey Parker is like, like he calls you
2625240	2628440	in a room and then you guys talk and then you laugh and laugh. And then he, at some point he
2628440	2634040	leaves the room and then he writes, uh, yeah. And those guys are there, you know, 20 hours a day.
2634040	2638680	And we come in for two hours and laugh it up and leave, which, you know, it's a dream job.
2638680	2642280	And, um, I have to say though, when you first walk into that, I'm not necessarily
2643080	2649080	first and foremost, a comedy writer, you know, so they just thought I was funny. Um, so that first
2649080	2653800	day I'm sitting in there and half the staff are actors as well. So they were, they get up and they
2653800	2658440	act out their character stuff. And I'm like, I'm not that at all. And I sat there for probably
2658440	2663400	the first hour of the first meeting, just going like, what am I doing here? How did this happen?
2663400	2666920	And I realized that if you don't open your mouth and say something, they're just going to fire your
2666920	2671320	ass. So I threw something out and it got a huge laugh. And then I was like, Oh, that's what this
2671320	2675400	job is now to what extent, cause this is the first time I've heard, cause I've heard about those
2675400	2682760	retreats. Um, and I always imagined them with a sense of dread because they sounded like auditions
2682760	2688360	like you went on the retreat and then some people that that was vodka, don't worry about it. Um,
2689640	2693800	some people that go on these, worry about it. Everybody gets to have the time of their life.
2693800	2698600	Some people going on the retreat, get the job. Some people don't. That was earlier on. You're
2698600	2702120	making it sound earlier. It was more of an audition thing. Um, by the time I was there,
2702120	2707560	that was just, I came in in the middle of a season. So I worked on three episodes, then went
2707560	2712680	on a retreat, worked on six episodes, then went on another retreat and worked on another six episodes.
2712760	2716440	They actually generate a voluminous amount of their season on the retreat.
2716440	2720360	Yeah. I mean, that's the basic, the, the basic structure. And it happens usually
2720360	2724600	about three weeks before the season starts. So it's relatively topical.
2724600	2728120	Did they structure it where you got to, uh, as a staff writer, get your name on a script?
2728120	2732040	Were they, you got to, nope, that was later down the road.
2732600	2736360	My name's on every episode I worked on as a staff writer at the end. So that's more than
2736360	2739240	almost every other television show. Staff writers don't even get,
2739800	2742760	is there a script you don't have to say yes or no. You don't, you don't have to say which script
2742760	2746920	is there a script that you feel very responsible for that you've got a lot of, a lot of stuff done
2746920	2752280	on. Yeah. There was one, um, I'm trying to think of the name of the script. It was basically about,
2752280	2758280	um, it grew out of a conversation between myself and Matt Stone about, um, the Star Wars special
2758280	2764600	additions that we just fucking hated them so much. And ET was coming out. That's a walkie talkie one.
2764600	2770360	Yeah. So right around that same time, we just, we came up with the idea that the boys had to
2770360	2776600	break into, uh, Lucasfilm or Skywalker sound and get the print of Raiders of the Lost Ark back.
2777880	2779320	Yeah. I think, Oh, it's called free hat.
2784200	2788360	That was one. And then the only other one that I can claim any responsibility for is the one
2788360	2793160	where, um, Kenny dies for real. I just thought what would happen if we just killed him?
2793640	2799640	And like there was a TV movie version of Brian song that was on somewhere on there. So we just
2799640	2804760	took that and made it into this whole like, Oh my God, our friend is going to die. Uh, but you
2804760	2811320	probably were gone by the time like what chef, uh, uh, had to be, uh, yeah, I was gone. Uh,
2811320	2815240	I mean that show, if there, there should be an absolutely separate Emmy category,
2815240	2821640	but only one show would win it for the ratio, the complicated ratio between passion, uh, uh,
2821640	2829240	relevance, um, uh, manpower, because there's like always been very few people working in that
2829240	2836920	show relative to and the speed with which they're working and how incredibly funny and like, like,
2836920	2841320	just like, what do you, what do you, what words do you say? They tell us all like balls out,
2841320	2847160	like, like fucking brave, bold, like opinionated, like, like, like fuck this thing. Like, like how
2847160	2852840	many of us in this room have like been swirling around with some thought in our head about some
2852840	2857800	piece of pop culture or politics or something? And then we get this like decidedly kind of
2857800	2863640	admittedly maybe libertarian view from, from, from South Park, but it kind of like pushes us over
2863640	2868280	into how to feel about something because it's done with this like grace and humor.
2869240	2872840	The great thing about those guys and what was really intoxicating working with them is they,
2873640	2878120	they have no tolerance for bullshit or hypocrisy. So if they see something, they have a point of
2878120	2881080	view on it and they just come out and say it. They just don't give a shit. They're just so
2881080	2885720	ripe for corruption so long ago. I mean, they, yeah. And they just, you know, I mean,
2885720	2890840	they just haven't, I mean, you know, they're in a really, um, wonderful place where they can
2891400	2895080	do whatever they want. And they've been able to, because they were successful with the show right
2895080	2899960	from the beginning that, um, spoiled because I only ever, I like, like South Park's gonna,
2900040	2906200	at some point not exist. It'll probably outlive me, but, but the way I, the way I eat, uh, but, uh,
2906200	2912040	the, the, it, it, there will be a day maybe when it's like gone and done and then there's gonna be
2912040	2917560	eulogies for it. Like there was for fucking whatever the hell that gossip rag was. All of
2917560	2922520	a sudden we found out that it was important that whatever, what the fuck was gizmo? Oh, gawker was
2922520	2926360	so important. Well, I imagine South Park's gonna turn out to be pretty fucking important the day
2926360	2932360	it goes off, uh, off air. Um, like I feel spoiled in the meantime because I've only ever just like
2932360	2940280	randomly run back into it, like an old lover and just always astounded at how still fucking funny
2940280	2947320	it is. Like you just watch, just like, oh, how is it still this funny? It's 48 years old. The cool
2947320	2953320	thing is that they, they kind of mixed things up the last two seasons where they made them serialized.
2953320	2957080	So as they had a storyline. I think that's the last episode I saw that ended the crescendo in the
2957080	2962040	divorce, the moving away, the, and I haven't watched it since because I've just spoiled South Park
2962040	2967160	wise. I'm like, well someday I'll just be, yeah. But I mean, yeah, I mean it's, it's, it's, I've
2967160	2972600	always been astounded by it. Like Cartman is probably one of the most important television
2972600	2976680	characters in television. He's right up there with Archie Bunker for me. Absolutely. I always
2976680	2981160	reference him at the same, in the same breath as Archie Bunker when you talk about like the
2981160	2986200	importance of this id character. Yeah. I don't mean the seasons of the episodes that don't like
2986200	2991320	do it for me as much as other seasons or episodes. When they got Cartman wrong, when they, when they
2991320	2996680	got Cartman right, it made it pretty special because they made it really, really bad. Like
2996680	3000440	it'd be really, really, really horrible. Right before I got there, they did the one where Cartman
3000440	3005400	basically killed someone's parents and fed them to a new chili. But that's a lot of people's
3006040	3011960	something must die. What's it called? Yeah. Yeah. But I was like, what's his last name? Scott Tenement
3011960	3019960	must die. That just ranking his tears at the end. Like, oh, the sweet misery of your tears. I mean,
3019960	3026440	if that's a fucking doozy. If I didn't, that was all Chevy Chase's character on community.
3027160	3031000	It's like, that was all I was ever doing was just ripping off Cartman. It was just the idea was like,
3031000	3037640	well, there's a character who's just like, he's the voice of that petty child within you. But that
3037640	3043640	includes talking to God. Like God is somebody that's going to ground you, make you take a time
3043640	3049320	out. You don't want it. We have a word for someone that responds to God saying that with fuck you.
3049320	3055160	That word is sometimes hero. Like, like, like, like mythic on a mythic level to say fuck you
3055160	3061480	to mortality, to say fuck you to the way you got out of bed in the morning. You know, it's off in
3061480	3066200	the face of privilege and oppression and bigotry. But it's that every once in a while, it's like,
3066200	3071400	yeah, don't go gentle into that good night. Like, like, like, like we we root for Cartman because
3071400	3077240	he's safely in the package of a reprehensible troll. But we get to like sap some of that toxin
3077240	3082200	just enough to dab on our tongue and like, like, like get high a little bit because it's like in
3082200	3086600	a safe container. And we've been learning that. I don't know if you heard me babbling, I was
3086600	3092440	talking to the Daryl Davis documentary. Have you seen that? I saw like a news piece on him. Because
3092440	3096920	I haven't seen the whole doc. He's basically dedicated his life to this sort of like attractive
3096920	3104520	belief that it's like, you don't want these people in the shadows. You want them as much as it pains
3104520	3111160	us. You don't it's like what good comes from them hiding. It's they're, they're, they're as bad as
3111160	3115480	they are. And they're twice as bad because whatever butt hurt fucking whatever birthday party
3115480	3120120	they didn't get invited to whatever they're fucking cranking about, like, sorry, but like,
3120120	3126840	you it's better to talk to him at Denny's and and and it's like he has this like collection of KKK
3126840	3134520	robes that are the culminate the slow erosion through friendship one on one of him sitting
3134520	3143160	down with a dude who says he wants all this and that to be this in that way. And being friendly
3143160	3151240	to them and at the end through that because a friendship with him is completely incalculable
3151240	3157240	to that philosophy. They have or maybe they just outgrow it. That would be an argument against what
3157240	3162520	he's doing. But he's like, they eventually like leave. They give him his robes, they don't outgrow
3162520	3168920	it. And there really is fall away. I am just this past year was developing a TV show that was about
3168920	3173560	a guy that has to infiltrate a white supremacist organization. And doing a lot of research into
3173560	3178520	that you come to realize that a lot of those people like they don't hate you because you are
3178520	3182920	a different color. They hate you because they don't know you. Right. You know, and that and that
3182920	3187000	when people indoctrinate people into these hate groups, they basically are saying, like, look,
3187000	3191560	it's not your fault that you're poor and broken stupid. It's their fault. Right. So by shifting
3191560	3196360	the blame, I mean, half the people that are our white supremacists just don't know any better.
3196360	3205640	They've either been raised in that culture. No, I mean, they literally don't know it. I'm telling
3205640	3210040	you it's literally energy that's being generated right now in this room, which I'd prefer to pass
3210040	3218600	on. But it's like that that heat, that hot front meeting that cold front, that hurricane watch this
3218600	3225160	documentary because it's that that what you're feeling. One person is very like they're like,
3225160	3229480	yes, like they're not they're not saying, yeah, racist or misunderstood. You need to talk to them
3229480	3233880	more. But then someone else is like, what the fuck are we doing? No, we don't need to understand
3233880	3237800	them. There's a guy from the Southern Poverty Law Center in the documentary who's like he's
3238440	3243880	he's a white dude talking to a black dude who's his age and they're neither of them are heroes
3243880	3248680	or villains. But he's like, Look, you're one thing he says is you're dealing on a retail level.
3248680	3252760	I'm dealing on a wholesale level. I don't fucking care whether you made a friend with a racist
3252760	3259160	yesterday. You know, good for him. Great. I want this shit illegal. You know, and it's like,
3259160	3265000	there are no villains in this story. But one thing that endures because he goes he goes to
3265000	3271160	Baltimore, and he's talking to millennial black activists who are fucking like they're on point
3271160	3276840	there, they're, you do not want to be like, talking down to them. They're like, they're,
3276840	3282440	they've been arrested 1000 times, maced 1000 times, they're in the trenches, if we're gonna,
3282440	3289240	if we're gonna grant veterans who have Iraq and things, if we're gonna say that when those people
3289240	3295720	speak that we owe it to them to not, you know, shit on them and dismiss them, then we definitely
3295720	3299880	have to extend that to activists who work in urban environments where you're on the front lines,
3300360	3307720	and these guys are smart, and they're absolutely bewildered by this old baby boomer guy who's
3307720	3314120	going like, I got this, I got this clan robe from the KKK, and I got this Confederate flag, and they're
3314120	3320600	like, what the fuck are you talking about? How long have you been doing this? And he's like,
3321160	3328200	50, I don't know how many, 50 years, I have no idea how long, and you got 25 racist dudes from
3328200	3335160	Memphis to, to give you their robes when they got tired of being racist? Like, this seems like a
3335160	3344360	fetish. And they, they try, they both, they try on both sides, I think that, I think that, and what
3344360	3349960	you see is that Gerald Davis is like, it's, you know, the word fetish is not, it's like, wow, yeah,
3349960	3355000	because he's like, he's like, he's in his comfort zone when he's laying back, and he's expressing
3355000	3360120	this unbelievable amount of acquiescence. But then they're calling him out and going like,
3360120	3367480	that's your comfort zone. That's you accruing this collection of shit in your garage. We're out here
3367480	3375320	nameless, faceless, taking, you know, stun baton stuff, then an older dude, baby boomer, I don't
3375320	3381080	know if that's accurate, older black dude, who's like, those guys, protector, mentor, those guys
3381080	3385960	both get up, they can't take the interview anymore. They're like, they don't yell, they don't shout,
3385960	3391880	but it breaks down. They get up and they leave. That guy comes over, he's got a gray beard, he,
3391880	3399800	he's the same generation as this guy. He's urban. And he is like there, he's been like proud of
3399800	3407080	those guys. And like, he tries, he's like, I can't shake your hand, like, but then he, that's the guy
3407080	3411960	that like almost spirals, he's like shouting, he's like, get the fuck out of here and don't come
3411960	3417960	back by the end of their conversation and doesn't want to hear Daryl's side of it because it's too
3417960	3421960	offensive. The thing that I walked away from it from was like this weird thing. Why am I dumping
3421960	3427720	this on you? I don't know, but, but, but the thing that, the thing that was the most pronounced about
3427720	3433000	it was the fact that like those young guys who were so smart and so cool and they had, they had
3433000	3437480	given so much. One of the things he got them to say, and I don't mean got them to say the way you
3437480	3443640	get Donald Trump to say that microwaves are cameras. I mean, I mean, he took the conversation
3443640	3450600	down a river that afforded us this glimpse around this curve of trees. One of the things he got them
3450600	3458680	to say was that they didn't believe that white supremacists could change. Now that's a very,
3458680	3467640	very interesting thing to admit to yourself because it puts you firmly on, on the side of a
3467640	3473960	line in a world that we're either going to fix, save, abandon, tear up, fighting each other. It
3473960	3480120	puts you on the side as, as just as you are and as righteous as you are and as right as you may be,
3480120	3485480	but it puts you firmly on the side of, of a war between people who think that we can do better
3485480	3491240	and people who are like, fuck it, we're fighting. He got the, they said that, you know, they, they
3491240	3495720	said, no, I don't think they can change. I think I don't, I don't know if they really, he didn't
3495720	3501320	give them a slide rule and 20 minutes to answer his question. I think maybe they would have said
3501320	3505880	over 20 minutes, like, well, people don't change through the actions that you're taking. People
3505880	3510680	change from, you know, blah, blah, blah, and you fish rots from the head or whatever. But, but in
3510680	3515160	that moment they're like, no, they don't, you can't change them. They don't change them. And so now,
3515160	3519640	it's like, and he says, of course he's aggravating them by saying this. He's like, well, you sound
3519640	3525320	like Donald Trump. Donald Trump hadn't been elected yet at the time of this interview. And then one of
3525320	3530440	the guys goes like, I hope Donald Trump gets elected because it's like the wolf versus the fox. I don't
3530440	3533880	like, I know what Donald Trump stands for. I'm not voting anyway. And all this shit. And you're like,
3533880	3538680	fuck this is like, where have we all been at the end of the documentary? Donald Trump's elected.
3538680	3543480	You have no idea where to fucking your head is spinning. You're like, who wins? Who loses?
3543480	3548120	What is happening? You just feel like you're being flushed out of toilet, like spiritually,
3548120	3553880	because you're just like, oh, we're all good people. When we look in the mirror, but we're all
3553880	3561640	fucking like insane. And we're gonna rip our faces off in the mirror. And we're just gonna wake up
3561640	3571880	and an octopus creature is gonna go, you failed. And the human simulation. Octopus 179, you,
3572440	3575880	when given the opportunity to be five different colors of chimp.
3580680	3584040	You fuck up. That seems like an unfair test to put on anybody.
3585160	3591000	To deprive them of anything other than what's actually being tested. Like they're inherent
3591000	3597560	fucking intense. Like, yeah, I mean, yes, I agree. It's unfair. But we come from a mythology as
3597560	3601560	primates were like, Oh, you're supposed to know the score. God's supposed to come down,
3601560	3609800	tell you don't eat the apple, and then I'll pay your rent. And if anything goes wrong,
3609800	3614600	you just blame women, you know, like, like, like, we're supposed to, we're supposed to get a
3614600	3619480	spreadsheet at the beginning of the test. Well, maybe everybody else feels gas lit in the sense
3619480	3623640	that they didn't know what the test was. It was a what's the what's the chapter in Genesis when
3623640	3628280	God comes back down after Eve gets made and says, I told him don't eat the apple. I can't remember.
3628280	3635880	I don't know. But it's not a newspaper. Anyway, it's a metaphor for Tim just answered Dan's question.
3638520	3649160	Brown. You really are the worst interviewee of all time. You just sit there and don't answer shit.
3649160	3656280	You think working on South Park for their first three episodes earns you the right to sit there
3656280	3664440	and say nothing? Well, I put my ass on the line about the shit I've gone through at Stanford.
3668200	3675160	I wrote Monster House. Do you have any idea how much research I had to do to write Monster House?
3675160	3681880	Do you have any idea what Monster House is? Yeah, actually, my roommate from college was one of
3681880	3691000	the animators on that. Oh, yeah. So you employed him. I created a job, but, you know, I thought I
3691000	3697000	thought that that was going to be a live action script when we wrote it. It wasn't it wasn't like
3697640	3702920	which is why it's actually I've made quite a bit of money on that movie because it was written under
3702920	3707480	live action rules. So you get residuals. Yeah. So every time they go to Blu-ray in Singapore or
3707480	3711720	something, I get a check that's like based on Oh, this was a WGA, blah, blah, blah.
3713240	3719400	Fascinating. But Tim, didn't you win some prestigious film writing award? Like some sort
3719400	3725160	of like I'm not saying I was about to ask about that. The Walter Salt Award. Waldo Salt.
3725160	3735320	Named after a famed writer who discovered salt. He wrote Salt, right? And he invented
3737320	3742520	wearing striped red and white shirts, crowds and hiding in large crowds. No, what is that award?
3742520	3747800	It was the Screenwriting Award at Sundance. So we actually, you know, I mean, I wrote this movie back
3747800	3755240	in 2004. It took forever to get made because the company we had written it for went out of business
3755240	3760840	and we found out they borrowed over a million dollars against our script. So our producer,
3761640	3767640	a wonderful guy named Brent Emery, literally spent seven years chasing down 81 different chain of
3767640	3772440	title issues and settling up with everyone so that they would get some of their money back if
3772440	3776760	we made the movie. And then it was like all of a sudden I got a call in June like I think we're
3776760	3782440	making this movie and then in August we were shooting it. In November we got into Sundance
3782440	3788200	and it premiered in January. Now what is that but it's not it's not a Sundance award for best
3788200	3792280	Blooby-Dee-Blue and a Blooby-Dee-Blue it's some guy's name. Waldo Salt is yeah I mean it's an
3792280	3796920	I guess it's like an honorarium or whatever. I mean it was set up by his family I think to honor
3796920	3800440	independent screenwriting or whatever but it's the one screenwriting award they do every year
3800440	3804520	at Sundance. So that was pretty unexpected. Yeah but you know Dan wrote Monster House.
3804520	3813560	Where's my Waldo Salt? Did you take it to Sundance? I don't. I would have. Yeah it's a
3814920	3821560	children's horror film. It's about a house that's. Hey Spencer you've been awful quiet over there.
3821560	3830840	No. Let's bring it back to the Stanford prisons for a moment. If you had your pick and you couldn't
3830840	3835480	like if the coin were tossed what do you think you would have been better or worse at being the
3835480	3841480	guard or being a prisoner? I'm sure I would be a kick-ass guard. I mean that's just my nature. I
3841480	3846920	you know I can be petty and mean. No no but that means you'd be a worse guard. Like you you would
3846920	3853160	be a worse person as a guard. Here's yes here's the thing it's like our whole like our whole like
3853160	3857160	goal with the entire movie was just to have people walk out at the end and ask that question of
3857160	3863160	themselves. Like do I have it within myself to turn into such an evil fucking person if given
3863160	3868840	the opportunity and having no repercussions. Right. And to that event or to that extent I think the
3868840	3875160	film works. It's funny that you know I've never seen I'd never seen a movie or anything I'd written
3875160	3879800	in front of a huge audience before and at Sundance we had like 1200 people at the first screening
3880360	3887560	and there's a title card that comes up that just says day two and literally the everything that
3887560	3892280	happened in the first day was so like everyone in the audience was like holy shit that like the air
3892280	3896120	got sucked out of the room and it was like one of the most like the hair stood up on the back of my
3896120	3900920	neck and I was like oh my god like this a movie just got a reaction and I had something to do
3900920	3906920	with that. Yeah that happened to me and Cody my girlfriend when we were watching it today at day
3906920	3913080	four because there wait what day four and I checked the progress indicator and uh but but that
3913080	3920120	and that's like part of the point I think that so is there uh the answer to that question is yes
3920120	3927320	correct the the people who are uh if you're made a guard by an institution guard in quotes meaning
3927320	3934200	a district manager uh if you're told that you're in charge of whether or not racism ends because
3934200	3940680	you're the race that ends racism uh if you're told that you're the the the employee of the
3940680	3945480	month if you're told if you're in charge of this parking spot you're in charge of anything any
3945480	3951880	power that you're given by an institution it seeps into the cracks of your soul and you you have two
3951880	3958760	choices you take on that role and actually surrender part of your empathy and individuality
3959320	3965880	in favor of serving that role better that's the important thing is that the guys that early on
3966520	3971960	who started as a joke because putting on the uniforms reminded them of cool hand luke one
3971960	3976520	guy goes I'm going to do my impression of a character from cool hand luke and then he comes
3976520	3981000	out he knows what to say to the president I want that you go to the problem and communicate well
3981000	3987640	and then the the scientists are going that guy's good more importantly nothing happens he's now in
3987640	3992840	charge everyone that's watching is going like well and then the shift changes and they go yeah
3992840	3997960	we did some fucked up shit today and nothing happened don't you think that's part of what it is
3997960	4003400	well Dan like you you are famous for don't you hate being told what to do let's say that you
4003400	4009720	were how old are these uh subjects back then early 20s they're between 18 and 22 and let's say that
4009720	4013560	you Dan found out you were the guard you don't like being told what to do you probably also you
4013560	4017080	you don't like well you know you do like telling people to do because you're a showrunner that's
4017080	4020520	part of your job description like what do you think you would be as a guard as a guard I would
4020520	4027000	be like I would posture as a but I would be eclipsed by some guy who went fascistic I would
4027000	4032440	be eclipsed by the guy who like jumped into the role like a while back I asked Spencer first
4032440	4038440	like I'm curious no Spencer you're so neutral like I can't pick you being turning into a shitty
4038520	4047480	dominated prisoner or a fascistic bully guard yeah but there are some people that now but that
4047480	4052120	response makes me think I would I don't want you as my guard but there's an important thing here
4052120	4059000	that you're getting to which is that there are uh there why what just all these it was yeah
4060680	4065480	there's it was a complex subject there's a way to be a prisoner as well and have you have these
4065480	4071560	narcissistic tendencies or things there's like as a prisoner I would they ask them do you would
4071560	4075880	you rather be a prisoner or a guard they don't necessarily and everyone wanted to be a prisoner
4075880	4081080	because they thought it'd be less work because if you're a prisoner you can just just sleep
4081080	4084680	you can be cool hand Luke yeah at the mark the most work is that you're defined you get three
4084680	4089160	hots in the cot you're always righteous the the truth is always on your side that's prison
4089160	4094440	I'm talking you can't be a bad there's no such thing as a villainous prisoner you don't have any
4094440	4100520	power where we live in fear of being bad people too the nobody wanted to be a guard but then the
4100520	4104360	people that excel at being guards are exhibiting the same personalities of the people who are
4104360	4110600	rallying the prisoners and that's when Zimbardo says these guys are swappable with a coin toss
4110600	4115160	that means in every revolution in every third world country when you have like gorillas coming
4115160	4120040	down from uh from from the hills and liberating the poor and then one of them becomes a dictator
4120040	4124360	and then you have the NSA interfering and it sounds like all these it just people are handing
4124360	4129480	you power handing you rules it's also there's also a certain level of compliance in certain people
4129480	4134040	um you know because part of what this showed as well as you know what happened at Abu Ghraib
4134040	4139480	is also what happened in Nazi Germany is that if uh you're in a situation where you feel you have
4139480	4144120	zero power and there's nothing you can do to change it like the the people that are against
4144200	4149720	you are so massively in power you know some people just it's normalization it's that shit
4149720	4154680	that's happening now people like in the in the eastern front work willfully were corralled into
4154680	4159720	a giant sand pit and they knew they were going to be killed and they did it meekly and mildly and
4160920	4166520	because that's what society told them is their role now did you did uh did any of the subjects
4166520	4172040	go to the film like see the film are they still i don't know um i know you know i was very happy
4172040	4176760	that um Zimbardo and his wife uh saw the movie right before we went to Sundance and he came to
4176760	4181480	Sundance and spoke and did all that stuff um but i was very happy because it's really weird telling
4181480	4187160	somebody's story and trying to get it right and and making sure not to also let him off the hook
4187160	4192200	you know we for a dramatic effect um you know in reality you haven't gotten to the third act yet
4192200	4196680	so i can't tell you um in reality it ended a little bit differently than it does in the movie
4196680	4202280	because that woman the the uh the triangle love woman comes back now leo jacaprio comes
4202280	4206120	to a skylight that's how you got your funding yeah traffic was a bitch
4209080	4215800	fucking california man but but let's let's mash a really hot button right now but it's it's it's
4215800	4221640	it's the elephant in the room which is really interesting is that prisons they were it was all
4221640	4227320	dudes dudes running it dudes are the whole movie is all dudes dudes dealing with dude issues to the
4227320	4231560	point where they're talking about stripping dudes of their dootness their individuality and they're
4231560	4235880	using it synonymously with the phrase feminization put them in dresses wait you get to the third act
4235880	4240600	call them call them she call them her call them you know and it's like let's reduce them of their
4240600	4247960	individuality not their masculinity their individuality by feminizing them 1971 so like
4247960	4253960	the now you cut to 2017 casual friday and somebody says to becky in marketing like you
4253960	4259320	should wear a shorter skirt or something it's like there's no bars on the windows there's no
4259320	4264520	the thing is this was a hallway at stanford college none of these kids during this entire story
4265480	4272760	ever accidentally started believing they were in prison they what what happened was they were
4273240	4280040	they were subjected long enough to deprivation of this and enhancement of that that their behavior
4280040	4286360	changed and it can happen in a hallway it can happen with cubicles around you well that's one
4286360	4290760	of the great things about the way kyle alvarez directed the movie and um i thought he had a
4290760	4295800	really good idea which was um when you first get introduced to the prison it's all shown in a
4295800	4300040	master shot so you see it's a fucking hallway in three classrooms and a closet used as a whole
4300680	4305560	um during the process the movie the lens is closed down and down and down to the point where
4305560	4309800	when things are really going shitty you're in close on people and there's a lot of uh
4310920	4315960	diffusion so it makes it feel it makes you feel claustrophobic and then when zambardo comes in
4315960	4320440	and ends it you cut back to that master you realize that the situation the place hasn't
4320440	4324600	changed the situation has changed was there anybody i mean i i read about this a long time
4324600	4329640	ago and you know in a psychology class or something and you know it's super fascinating
4329640	4335160	and we all know about that we say these words but did anybody emerge from that guard or
4335160	4339960	prisoner and like fuck this shit i'm walking out of here like did anybody like flex up and go this
4339960	4345000	this is dumb no that was that's the one thing nobody ever directly asked to be let out
4345000	4348200	well when they could at any point they could just say you know what fuck this let me let me go home
4348200	4353640	you can't keep me here nobody did it because the the rules from above down kept them feeling like
4353640	4357320	you know it's this is one of the things that zimbardo and stanley milgram have done
4357320	4362440	um in in a lot of different experiments um one of which that comes to mind is uh stanley milgram
4362440	4367480	did an experiment where he put an ad in the paper for like a secretary and um rented an office in a
4367480	4373400	high rise in new york and hired two people to be plants basically in the office so when the woman
4373400	4377480	would come in to interview for the office these two people were told to stay still and don't react
4377480	4382360	the woman would sit down and they'd start pumping smoke into the room and because the other two
4382360	4388200	people wouldn't react to it the third person nine out of ten times wouldn't react to it the fact
4388200	4393800	the fucking building's on fire i i mean that's how how powerful society can be that's me i mean i
4393800	4399560	think i i'd be that third person i i truly feel like so defined by what everyone is reacting to
4399560	4405640	i feel like i wait way too long i told a story about going out to lunch with uh my friend dino
4405640	4411080	and our new uh cfo at my studio and he started choking on a piece of hanger steak and i was
4411080	4418200	very disappointed with my uh reaction time is that is a man choking to death that was like
4418200	4425000	waiting for what bruce willis to like come in i don't know man but i i yeah i i'm afraid to find
4425000	4428600	out what i'm made of that's why i bought a gun when trump got elected i don't want to know what
4428600	4433160	i'm made of because the answer is nothing i'm made of nothing what do you what am i john clod van
4433160	4438440	dam i'm not made of anything i didn't earn anything i i i've spoken about the show before i'm sure i
4438440	4443160	got pulled over on a warrant i hit and run a sign and i got picked up on a saturday morning
4443160	4449560	and spent all weekend in jail in wittier and uh wittier california yeah i'm not proud of it
4451400	4457960	but i got uh you know handcuff put in the car put in jail and i was in the jail like probably
4457960	4463560	like six or seven or eight cells uh they left me in my they put me in the the tank like the
4463640	4468920	drunk tank because like everyone else was three to a cell uh so they they were like two guys on a
4468920	4473000	cot and one guy on the floor and i would have to deal with the drunks that were let in every night
4473000	4479560	or the both nights and what was amazing was i was a college kid i was the only white guy in there
4480120	4485160	and i was treated as shitty as they were and it was you were instantly not a person and i changed
4485160	4490280	the way i talked the way i made eye contact with the with the uh with the officers there you're
4490280	4495400	instantly told that you're a piece of shit and when you leave there you still think so you don't
4495400	4499320	leave there and go oh i'm gonna walk home now i got out of here finally after being treated like
4499320	4506280	garbage and again this this wasn't peru and it wasn't you know this wasn't syria it was it was
4506280	4515160	california but he's like wittier yeah wittier is only nominally california uh it's uh i i'm not
4515160	4519480	saying that like my story is the worst story of all time but i i was surprised how instantly i
4519480	4527240	felt like completely uh not in any sort of power and and instantly not an equal with anybody there
4527240	4532360	you're you're a scumbag and you're dirt and i felt like that for days afterwards and well imagine
4532360	4537720	that for 30 years yeah i can't well i i'm fascinated by and watch shows about people being locked up
4537720	4544760	it's like it's like the time passes it doesn't pass and when you leave there you're not better
4544760	4549880	you're you're psychologically like a little dizzy and fucked up and and and probably a lot
4549880	4555800	worse if you you know had to go through actual shit i was just in a in a fucking drunk tank for 52
4555800	4563080	hours it was a nightmare uh so like like what i was thinking about the stanford experiment is like
4563080	4567480	they love fucking with you the moment you're in there they love it well part of it does also
4567480	4571320	boredom they're doing eight hour shifts where they have nothing to do except well we can either sit
4571320	4575000	in this room or we can bring these guys out and make them do jumping jackson and push them
4575000	4578600	around and fuck and they get spit on and yelled at and harassment and stuff and they just love
4578600	4583720	having like it's a shit job it's noisy it smells like crap it's uh the food is garbage they're
4583720	4587720	not happy they don't like their lives they wanted to be in a secret service with the fbi and they
4589720	4596200	and it's it's a fucking bummer and they do take a little bit of just human glee in knowing that
4596200	4602200	they fucked you around more than they got fucked around that day and i was a sophomore
4602200	4606760	at usc at the time i was you know like everything going like the rest of the guys in there the only
4606760	4610120	people that were nice to me were the cholo gang bangers in there who fucking looked after me and
4610120	4620520	fucking like and they nicknamed me hollywood and when i got you'll go far in prison with a nickname
4620520	4625320	like well well i was warned up what would happen if i had to go to county to get processed out
4625320	4631880	luckily i just got to get kicked out of the of woody or jail uh but i got handcuffed like
4631880	4636840	ankles and and wrists to the courthouse to walk down the street and we get in there and it's a
4636840	4640440	bunch of dudes that come in from county and some guys are going away for attempted murder some
4640440	4644920	guys are going away for like assault terrorist terrorist threats which means like i just threatened
4644920	4649640	to kill somebody in front of the police officer some are going to go away for 20 years some guys
4649640	4653800	six months and everybody was going up like all the veterano like cholo guys walking up to everybody
4653880	4657320	like hey man you're gonna get love don't worry like you you get six you got six years you'll
4657320	4660760	be out in two and a half homes and also you're gonna be with my homie and she know like i know
4660760	4665160	this fucking guy he's my cousin and they were all going around and telling everybody it's gonna be
4665160	4669480	okay like you're gonna be looked after there like i'll make sure you talk to my friend so and so
4669480	4676600	and i had to get walked up to the courthouse uh to to i saw one judge with the oldest dude in there
4676600	4681240	this like with the teardrops and the whole thing is old school veterano and he walked up and he goes
4681240	4685080	listen man like you're a good kid like what are you doing in here i mean i fucking didn't pay a
4685080	4689480	fine like i knocked over a sign and didn't have the money to pay for the thing and had a bench warrant
4689480	4692600	and i didn't pay the fine because yeah this judge fucking hates you man like he's an asshole
4693240	4696360	like he hates me he hates everybody but we're gonna go see this guy we're handcuffed walking
4696360	4700520	to the elevator together took up and he goes you don't say shit unless he talks to you
4700520	4703640	and if he talks to you don't say anything but the answer to his fucking question
4704440	4708360	and and if he asks you anything else say is you're missing your fucking second day of your second
4708440	4711640	year at school and you're a good kid and you shouldn't and you don't belong here
4713320	4717800	and when i when he stood up to get his thing i had to stand up and when i had this vice versa
4717800	4722040	and i got back down it all went cool got back down and they kicked me out they called you to go
4722040	4726360	jeff davis and i'm not joking you i know everyone thinks i'm making up these fucking stories
4729160	4733960	and i i don't care if you do because this happened and i almost and i i will cry thinking about it
4733960	4739560	they were like 15 20 22 guys in there the toughest guy in there was sleeping as a pillow
4739560	4744600	he had the only roll of toilet paper and that was his pillow so no one had toilet paper uh everyone
4744600	4748120	else being really nice to each other they're all in the county blues and orange and when they
4748120	4755160	called my name jeff davis the fucking guy's name they went hollywood what does that mean
4755160	4758840	am i going to county and like no that no that means you got love homes that means you got love
4758840	4762520	and when i got when they let me out when they fucking let me out the door
4762520	4766840	fucking dudes came up and hugged me and the cops outside looked at me they like they wanted to
4766840	4774280	fucking beat my ass from the parking lot so it's a story about uh me being the coolest guy in the
4785080	4791160	fucking make myself a drink i can't believe i have a story i haven't told in the show already
4793480	4794760	you told that story
4798040	4805640	we have 500 episodes it's fine it's fine uh i know they uh but the the interesting thing
4805640	4811480	about that though when i listen to that though having watched tim's screenplay movie i was going
4811480	4816600	to say tim's movie but then i didn't want the uh director to be like send me a rabbit's head
4816600	4821960	or something whatever they directors do and you call it the writer's movie um the there's a point
4821960	4826200	in there where there's a there's a tension paid to breaking up the solidarity within the ranks
4826200	4830760	and when we talk about like oh the guards are pieces of shit and the prisoners have all this
4830760	4838680	solidarity it's it's not even it's like my new eye on that is like yeah but you can also put
4838680	4845080	divisive energy into a population if if you had been in a situation if you had been in a uh
4845160	4852120	incarcerative uh environment in which the administrative uh powers that be felt
4852840	4860360	threatened um there might have been a a system in place in which you were more pitted against
4860360	4866920	your fellow inmates uh because they had already perceived a threat and put energy into it which
4866920	4872840	they can easily do in the most subtle of ways drive a wedge between everybody uh give them
4873480	4878680	less toilet paper for pillows give them or give them one role and give this guy spaghetti and
4878680	4885400	give that guy not spaghetti and it's something that they do very readily in order to quell
4885400	4894520	the potential so i know i'm going to sound like a fucking weird uh uh apologist for the man or
4894520	4899880	whatever but i'm actually like now i'm looking at that and going like instead of hearing that
4899880	4904520	it's like ah yeah those fucking guards i'm like thinking you know those guards probably living
4904520	4908760	in an environment that's like as close as you can get to having an incarcerated group and then
4908760	4913480	they're in charge of guarding it which is why they're so bitter when those guys start getting
4913480	4919960	happy and abu-graping it's because there's been a tension actually deliberately put down into like
4919960	4923800	making sure that for instance an environment gets created where somebody wants to beat you up
4924360	4928360	like like like because you're just in the same cell as them or they're you know what i mean
4929000	4935720	well i mean in my little minute situation it was a police station and the people that were there
4935720	4939880	were probably going to county and then a lot of them were going to be in county for a while
4940440	4945560	then probably go to federal prison or and then you have to come back to a county then back to
4945560	4949480	a jail like they're going to be in there for a long time they they told me like this is as
4949480	4954360	good as going to get and they warned me about what happens at the other stages like here's
4954360	4958760	when you don't take a shit and here's where you put things that you care about not losing
4959320	4963000	and and here's like and they all told me like you know the thing that you're like you're
4963000	4967320	going to have to color up with the white white power dudes and all that shit and i was just like
4967320	4975560	i just i i just my stomach was just liquid the entire time because the good thing was that
4976440	4981800	i was vegetarian i just become vegetarian and it was bologna and cheese sandwiches they gave i gave
4981880	4988120	them all my bologna they give me all the cheese the reason i had a kick at it not cheese was
4988120	4991240	bullshit but it was the best cheese sandwich you ever had the reason i'm bringing this up because
4991240	4995240	i'm trying to carry over i'm constantly like all this talk about the stanford prison experiment
4995240	4999000	what that experiment was what it meant the fact that it didn't have to be scientifically accurate
4999000	5002680	the fact that it's less a cautionary tale about science and how to get data and all this stuff
5002680	5008600	the fact that what it really means is that you can be in the stanford prison experiment
5008600	5015000	and there can be no bars around you you can be in a three-piece suit you can have a big mustache
5015000	5021000	you can be the star of your own biopic and you can be in the stanford prison experiment you
5021000	5028280	whenever you are told which is every minute of every day by reddit by commenters by everything
5028280	5033400	you're told by your the ghost of your mother that you have a role and you're in an argument
5033480	5038680	you're a libtard you're a wingnut you're a right right wingy left wingy i'm policing i'm an
5038680	5045480	apologist i'm a thing and i'm gonna i'm engaging with another human being and as i found out like
5045480	5051320	like like you know buying my fucking gun like a maniac like the and looking through sandy hook
5051320	5054760	conspiracy theorists it's like i've had a plan this whole podcast to bring this message home
5056200	5061640	walk out of here knowing that you're already in a prison i mean you can't just walk out of life
5061640	5067720	you can't walk out of america especially not now um you might not be let back in like we're all
5068360	5072920	we're in an environment and the environment is being run and i'm not saying that means let's
5072920	5079080	go throw a garbage can through a window that won't do any good it means that if you know if
5079080	5084280	you remind yourself that you're in an environment that you're encased in something you'll you might
5084280	5090040	you might maintain your empathy those guys that knew the system that were saying hollywood here's
5090040	5096520	the thing the judge does this and does that like they were they were wearing a mask they were saying
5096520	5102760	like we're in this system the system is a system like the real life exists outside of it now while
5102760	5107800	you're in here don't fuck with that guy's toilet paper try the soup instead of the salad you're
5107800	5113160	gonna be fine there's solidarity there's empathy possible because everything's been removed from
5113240	5119400	them except that there's been not an undue amount of like divisive energy placed on it
5120360	5124840	hopefully we could withstand that too if you're looking at another human being digitally or
5124840	5130360	whatever and you have that temptation to go animal because you filled as i have been with
5130360	5135800	that fucking outrage where you're like i know what i'm about and i know what i'm
5135800	5140760	up against and i'm going to tell this piece of fucking 15 year old canadian shit how politics
5140760	5149800	works on twitter like he might have been for a team one group that wouldn't uh you have a 15
5149800	5157000	year old canadian daughter okay fine i was like i don't like like like it it it venezuelan whatever
5157000	5164760	won't offend you shut the fuck up see it happen to me again it's as easy as somebody telling me i
5164760	5172680	don't know what i'm doing fuck you i think i own a gun lady yes it's at a gun store it's at a gun
5172680	5181800	store but i own it see that you you feel like a prisoner but you're acting like a guard and
5181800	5185000	that's the whole point like we're all we have a guard because i've been given the microphone
5185000	5191880	well i took it with a lifetime of talent um they give them they give them they give them aviator
5194840	5196600	is that the title of the show yes it is
5198520	5202760	we've got some good selections like they give them aviator glasses and and and like everything's
5202760	5207080	a fantasy like prison guards don't necessarily always wear aviator sunglasses but it's like
5207080	5213000	it's also it's um uh an image of authority it's like when you can't see behind someone's eyes
5213000	5218120	or you can't see their eyes empathy yeah i mean it's everything about that the whole thing was
5218120	5223000	designed just to remove humanity from the entire when they interrogate suspects they take advantage
5223080	5226840	of that thing that howie mandell turned into a game show the prisoner's dilemma you take a
5226840	5232360	suspect you you want them to rat on each other you you you you separate them you make sure they
5232360	5238920	can't see and touch each other and you say to one the other one says you did it now what will you do
5238920	5244520	will you will you your empathy is put to the test like will you bother to walk as a lamb to the
5244520	5249880	slaughter well this other piece of shit that you don't know that i can tell you about is telling
5249880	5254440	you that you're the one that did it or will you do the sensible thing to protect yourself and just
5254440	5261000	tell me that that other person is a bad person and that's the fucking internet like it divides
5261000	5266760	it divides eight billion people into individual cells we cannot see or touch each other and we
5266760	5273640	are being told by headlines and and clickbait like that that that we don't understand each other and
5273640	5279240	that we are going to fuck each other over but also it it in bringing it back to like a prison
5279240	5284120	environment with the internet there's no accountability which is again how abugrave
5284120	5288680	happened it's like you put a bunch of people that don't have the proper training in a um a position
5288680	5292760	of authority without any supervision and fucked up shit's gonna happen against people that have no
5293480	5299080	habeas corpus and no no outside contact like there's absolutely it's a free-for-all right
5299080	5304360	it's a it's a giant frat party it's it's it's it's nuts uh you've been in uh rooms that you
5304360	5310520	probably can't talk about like the last jedi where weren't you didn't you no i haven't been
5310520	5318200	in rooms i was actually on the set of the last kill okay um but i was also on the set of rogue
5318200	5323640	one well i know the set was cool well i just talked to the set of rogue one and they said
5323640	5330440	the set of the last jedi uh is a piece of shit so either you fucking rat on them and i don't know
5330440	5337080	how that was if you could have pulled that rabbit out of my head there's nothing you can
5337080	5340920	tell us you can tell us about the emotional experience of being on a star wars set well
5340920	5344920	um the the cool thing is i went over there when they were prepping for last jedi or episode eight
5345000	5353880	or whatever they're calling it um and i'd rather be a guard
5361480	5368520	it's so easy it's so easy to be mean sometimes you just have to wait 49 minutes you say
5369160	5371800	i say three words it's great
5376280	5381720	sorry you're okay dan well it was nice speaking because you did the funniest thing in the show
5381720	5385640	and you've said three sentences it's a living
5385640	5397160	yeah what kind of food did they get in the uh in the stanford experiment
5398280	5405160	shitty shit but but uh you know dan had mentioned before they also did like there were two uh cells
5405160	5410360	that revolted and one that acquiesced and so they gave them like a special meal from outside i mean
5410360	5415320	they were constantly like if if using um things against other prisoners but they made that up on
5415320	5419640	the fly because of the actual instant need that they had that the experiment hadn't predicted
5419640	5424440	which was that the prisoners would band together and revolt oh we're all together so why don't we
5424440	5429160	just outnumber them and do this or that and then they were like okay now we divide you now we give
5429160	5434760	them soup and not use it and then we take people out of one cell and put them you know if the three
5434760	5438360	of you have become friends we're going to break you up and put you in different groups the fact
5438360	5442520	that we wouldn't see that lie happening when we talk about race and gender and everything else
5442520	5449160	that divides us in we get we talk so fucking rarely about income bracket we for a country
5449160	5454040	that runs on the dollar that's creating a middle class by saying that you get you're the privileged
5454040	5460280	you create a giant underclass of people of all shapes and sizes that are all poor which is the
5460280	5464520	only thing that matters and so it's like very obvious the tricks that you play when you look
5464520	5469160	at prisons you're like oh what do they do when they feel like at any moment like everybody might
5469160	5475160	go run um they wouldn't be able to do much uh but not that i'm advocating for that and i don't know
5475160	5479800	what that would look like uh i guess all of us using toilet paper for pillows at the same time
5480760	5487400	um just try it or don't pay your income tax i don't know but if it's uh the the uh red beams
5487400	5492680	form on my chest uh but okay so star wars you're on the set and there's interesting they had
5492680	5499800	lightsabers yeah um yeah the the coolest thing was i got to go in the millennium falcon which is
5499800	5504360	meticulously recreated now what does that mean it means it means there well there are two versions
5504360	5508040	of it there's one that's like an exterior version that they use like a full-sized one
5508040	5512920	like out in the world or whatever like a wait what do you mean well like they shot in ireland
5512920	5518840	and at one set they had like an exterior full-size millennium yes what yes what yeah what they built
5518920	5522680	it like a building yeah so you can walk in and out of it and see the cockpit from the outside
5522680	5530920	fuck you but why would they even do that i would fire that line producer cg that shit what well i
5530920	5536280	mean i don't know that's amazing i'm glad they did yeah they did it for episode seven and then
5536280	5541160	that was what was still standing was not the exterior but the interior so you walk up basically
5541160	5544920	the ramp of the millennium falcon and then you're on you're in the millennium falcon the whole thing
5544920	5548920	like how much the whole the whole the whole kit caboodle all the way through like the holding area
5548920	5553880	where they play chess and um and into the cockpit and all that stuff they should just amortize that
5553880	5558440	with doing a netflix sitcom like like yeah they could just pay for that whole thing with like six
5558440	5567240	seasons of a workplace comedy it's a cult called millennium nights apparently it it cost it cost a
5567240	5572520	shit ton of money because um they went back and like when they made the original millennium falcon
5572520	5576680	half the stuff were all old airplane parts and stuff like that and none of that existed anymore
5576680	5581400	so they had to go in like 3d print from reference photos all this shit so you walk in there and it's
5581400	5585560	like oh my god i just walked into my fucking childhood wait wait to what level of detail like
5585560	5590840	every nook and cranny like everything so like they could shoot anything there yeah i mean you
5590840	5595000	know if you watch force awakens i mean there are shots where you walk through the whole thing and
5595000	5598840	that's there that's what i'm saying like and that was like it shouldn't be a sitcom it should be like
5598840	5604920	an erin sorkin like like what it's like a west wing like it's like there's nothing but walking
5604920	5609960	and talking in the falcon what's your opinion you can't you you can't say anything about where

5880760	5886200	i get it i get it there's no reason i named that character chowder i'm like there's no way he said
5886280	5892680	one of the three main characters from your movie as there's an easy way no it's like he's the sad
5892680	5898360	fat guy in the movie and you having not seen the movie you said the same thing i did you
5898360	5905240	named a sad fat guy from your heart i have no ill will against you now if you come in my window
5905240	5917880	tonight unless i'm seeing wrong you're dead it would be a wicked retarded move

5925240	5937240	is it isn't isn't your sister is my sister yes she's a cool person from boston no my sister's
5937240	5941800	institutionalized in madison what do you yeah yeah way to bring it down jeff
5944840	5951800	pretty fucked up drag my sister into it no but that's not what that phrase means it's more of
5951880	5955560	a term of endearment there i agree that's why i said no offense to
5958440	5961880	tim don't listen to him
5963720	5971640	fuck that tim face me for a moment go ahead do jeff go talk to hollywood where you're gonna see
5971640	5975720	is dan for the next five or so minutes before we finish the show is just still mad about people
5975720	5981560	chanting hollywood so he's gonna he's gonna try everything he can to to sort of salvage
5981560	5985960	some sort of uh some dignity out of this whole thing and he's gonna bring you down with that
5985960	5993160	ship that's fine yeah okay you can go back to den i want just thank you tim i feel like what you
5993160	5999000	just saw was when they chanted hollywood jeff was stimulated on a level we didn't realize
6002920	6009400	and it made is that why he's sitting down yes that's why this podium is so large we could talk about
6009720	6014360	it what's this what's the script that was on the blacklist balls out for the
6016360	6021080	thank you um yeah balls out was this script that i wrote with another guy named
6021080	6025080	malcolm spellman um under the pseudonym of the robotart 8000
6027320	6033080	so we wrote the script it was during the writer strike um the last one and we just were like fuck
6033080	6037880	it let's write what we want to write not um anything for anyone in particular and um
6038760	6042440	we finished it we brought it to our representatives and they were like no fucking way we're not taking
6042440	6048040	this script out it's too offensive and literally like nobody would take it out um i had a couple
6048040	6051800	of friends that we were commiserating with and just said fuck it just throw it up on the internet
6051800	6056600	and see what happens so the script itself yeah so i created a website that looks like it was
6056600	6064440	created by a differently abled robot um and uh and had some friends that were screenwriters just
6064440	6069160	give us like a blurb if they liked it and um all of a sudden it just took off and as of like
6069160	6076840	last week it's been downloaded almost 200 000 times which is insane um yeah and it's the only
6076840	6081560	the only script so far that's ever gotten on the blacklist without ever being sent out
6082520	6087320	you know people read it afterwards but but it never officially went out for anyone to really
6087320	6093720	buy so is it like uh what's jerry lewis's one the day the clowns cried yeah but we did we did
6093720	6099320	actually um the blacklist podcast we did we did a stage reading of it oh really yeah and recorded
6099320	6103160	that actually it's like oh well yeah this is a movie this does work so that was kind of fun
6103160	6109000	the blacklist is the thing that i'm only familiar with third hand like i've never actually gone to
6109000	6115000	anything and seen anything i my studio has optioned a script that was number one on the
6115000	6119480	blacklist i know that i can repeat that to people but that's not how it was brought to me now the
6119480	6123800	blacklist yeah again it's one of those things it's it's just a bit of a popularity contest when
6123800	6128040	it first started out it was literally this guy franklin leonard just asked his friends what were
6128040	6132920	their favorite movie script that they'd read and he put them all together and made a list out of it
6132920	6138680	and then now it's become this sort of other entity um but you know the idea though that we ended up
6138680	6144120	pretty high on the blacklist without ever like you know our whole thing was like this is a fucking
6144120	6148680	balls out comedy you got to send it to everybody you send it to the entire town and like five percent
6148760	6156120	are going to love it and they wouldn't send it to anybody um so yeah you know it's um you should
6156120	6163320	read it dan what do you if you think describing the conceit will just make it sound through
6163320	6167560	in this no it'll sound stupid again the whole idea was to just like we just were like fuck it
6167560	6172040	about every rule of screenwriting while adhering to every rule of screenwriting uh so it's it's
6172040	6176520	basically it's about a guy who um you know has been leading his life the way society tells him
6176920	6181320	which is you know if i do if i keep my head down and do good work i'll get you know the white
6181320	6185880	picket fence and the house and the wife and the two kids and he comes to a point where he realizes
6185880	6191960	that like nothing in his life is going his way gets struck by lightning um has a moment where
6191960	6198200	he realizes there's nothing after life but the reality is it's actually like the the circle of
6198200	6202520	light opens up behind him he's just too dumb to look around and he comes and he wakes back up and
6202600	6206760	he's just like fuck it i want i'm gonna make a list of things i want that girl that car and that
6206760	6210840	job because he got hit by lightning because he realizes there's no point to anything there's
6210840	6216600	no point to waiting and following rules so he just goes balls out basically and just starts doing
6216600	6221000	whatever is necessary to to get what he wants and then realizes of course you know that he's
6221000	6230760	president of the united states that he's president that was awesome we could have the laugh meter got
6230760	6237800	closed to show clothes i know but we are we're trying to we're trying to go on a show a runtime
6237800	6244120	diet like come on we should really cut these calories and if they if they react loudly enough
6244120	6251720	we should just end the show like rap battles stands for rap stands for guard versus prisoner
