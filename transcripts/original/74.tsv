0	4000	Boom, Oong-ow, baby got the power.
4000	5000	What?
5000	8000	Boom, Oong-ow, baby got the power.
8000	11000	Boom, Oong-ow, baby got the power.
11000	15000	Boom, Oong-ow, baby got the power.
15000	18000	Bonjour, gentlemen. Welcome to Harmon Town.
18000	20000	Welcome to Harmon Town.
20000	22000	From Meltdown Comics.
22000	26000	Hollywood, California. Harmon Town is once again in session.
26000	30000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harmon Town,
30000	34000	Jen Harmon.
34000	55000	Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
55000	59000	Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
59000	60000	All right.
60000	66000	That is my response to record low attendance.
66000	70000	A small but an alert crowd.
70000	79000	I have done, I have performed for four people once.
79000	82000	And it was one of the greatest shows I've ever done.
82000	87000	When I was doing professional improv in Milwaukee,
87000	91000	one of my gigs was I was summoned to the living room
91000	94000	of a woman who my agent told me.
94000	97000	I had an agent, an improv agent.
97000	101000	She told me and Mundy Carter that we would be performing for,
101000	104000	I'm sorry, I said four, it was six people.
104000	107000	Because she said it's three couples,
107000	110000	and the reason they're getting together,
110000	112000	they have a quiet evening at home,
112000	115000	and the reason is because one of the wives and one of the three couples
115000	119000	has just been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.
119000	121000	So will you please go to their home
121000	124000	and will you please do some improv for them in their living room?
124000	128000	And can I get 10% of that action?
128000	131000	And it was a great show, it was great.
131000	134000	There's no stories to tell there, I'm just saying.
134000	140000	This show is irregularly light because of one reason.
140000	145000	Possibly because of Breaking Bad Finale, maybe.
145000	148000	Maybe just because of slow entropy.
148000	153000	Maybe it's for the same reason that there's not as much gasoline
153000	156000	when you pull oil out of the earth.
156000	161000	Maybe we've condensed, maybe these are the real harmonians.
161000	165000	I'd like to think that the people here tonight are the real Harmontown fans.
165000	172000	This is the night where it all comes together.
172000	176000	Or it's people who have Monday off, or it's people who...
176000	180000	Yeah, this is the night where we actually go to the moon.
180000	185000	And the fucking other 60 people that didn't come are going to miss the boat.
185000	187000	That's it.
187000	189000	We're taking a moonboat.
190000	197000	We're going to row through a Milky Wave stream of starlight with a paddle of love.
197000	200000	No, we're going to get deep, we're going to get intimate.
200000	202000	We're going to make it the best show ever.
202000	204000	And people who didn't come here tonight are going to...
204000	208000	They don't deserve to be punished, but they should know.
208000	212000	They'll be old and they'll be on a rocking chair at a veranda somewhere.
212000	216000	And they'll think, I chose Breaking Bad over that Harmontown.
216000	220000	And I went there 70 times and didn't come to that one.
220000	223000	And that is why I failed.
223000	226000	They'll be on the porch next to another person on a rocking chair,
226000	227000	and that person will go,
227000	233000	you know the premiere of Breaking Bad's finale was on iTunes two days before that night.
233000	235000	And they'll go, really?
235000	238000	They'll go, yep, sure as this lemonade, sweet.
238000	240000	Are we really on a porch?
240000	245000	No, we're in an alien holographic four-dimensional storage unit.
245000	249000	Our species is long been enslaved by lizards.
249000	250000	It won't matter.
250000	259000	But we need not worry about crowd volume.
259000	263000	We have to worry about morality.
263000	267000	We have to worry about the pudding inside...
267000	271000	In which lay the proof.
271000	274000	The pudding inside your skulls,
274000	278000	where this weird pudding network that we don't understand yet
278000	281000	creates the perceived difference between good and bad.
281000	285000	I was just listening to a Radiolab on the way here,
285000	287000	which is where I get all of my information
287000	291000	that doesn't have anything to do with me or community.
291000	295000	And they were telling this story about this guy.
295000	298000	I'm 20 minutes into it and I'm already riveted.
298000	302000	He had seizures and so he had part of his brain removed
302000	305000	and then he had another part of his brain removed
305000	307000	and then all of a sudden the cops are at his door
307000	309000	because he's got kiddie porn on his hard drive
309000	314000	because his personality shifted and changed.
314000	316000	What was fascinating to me is whether or not
316000	318000	his personality shifted and changed.
318000	321000	What's most fascinating to me is that I'm listening to a podcast
321000	323000	that's produced by people that are saying,
323000	324000	let's figure this out.
324000	327000	Let's figure out whether or not this person's a good or bad person
327000	329000	or when he became a good or bad person
329000	333000	or what defines good or bad behavior.
333000	339000	Are we living in a world where we all constantly can't wait
339000	342000	to jump on the internet and look at naked pictures
342000	344000	of three-year-olds?
344000	349000	Or are we living in a world where that is not the case
349000	352000	and therefore there needs to be an understanding
352000	356000	that something weird is going on in your head if that's going on?
356000	361000	Do we regard every single thing that you do
361000	364000	that is not compatible with the board cube
364000	369000	as being a malady on your part?
369000	371000	Do we then forgive you?
371000	374000	Having forgiven you, do we try to cure you?
374000	379000	All of these are rhetorical questions.
379000	381000	None of them have answers.
381000	383000	This is the root of what we're doing.
383000	385000	This is what society is.
385000	387000	All of us have this pudding in our brain.
387000	389000	All of us think at one time or another,
389000	391000	oh, I'm going to go up to that guy and I'm going to say,
391000	392000	good morning.
392000	393000	Well, that's been approved.
393000	394000	That's fine.
394000	395000	That's on a ticker tape.
395000	397000	You're going to be the 500 millionth person
397000	399000	to say good morning to another person.
399000	401000	You have zero chance of going wrong there.
401000	403000	The other person says good morning back.
403000	405000	Zero chance, again, of going wrong there.
405000	408000	Now, at some point, if you want to climb up the ladder,
408000	411000	if you want to get closer to the papaya than the chimp above you,
411000	413000	you have to start risking things.
413000	415000	You have to start doing things differently.
415000	418000	You have to start expressing yourself.
418000	420000	Good morning.
420000	424000	Too cloudy, though, yesterday.
424000	426000	There's a risk there that the guy in front of you will go,
426000	429000	what the fuck are you talking about?
429000	431000	Everything will go crazy.
431000	434000	Men with Kevlar vests will come in and grab you and say,
434000	437000	why did you think it was too cloudy yesterday?
437000	440000	Why did you think that?
440000	442000	What is wrong with you?
442000	444000	You need to go to prison.
444000	446000	You need to go to a hospital disguised as a prison.
446000	448000	You need to go to a prison disguised as a hospital.
448000	450000	You need to be crucified.
450000	453000	You need to be apologetic.
453000	455000	You need to be fixed.
455000	458000	What is our goal?
458000	459000	What is our endgame?
459000	461000	What do we expect of each other?
461000	464000	When we see another human being on the street,
464000	466000	do we want them to be like us
466000	469000	or do we want them to be different?
469000	471000	I think the answer is probably Goldberg,
471000	474000	where you fucking cool it with the package.
474000	477000	It's a bag of Cheetos.
477000	479000	Is that you, Adam Goldberg?
479000	481000	99 cents for a bag of sun chips.
481000	483000	The expense is the whole show.
483000	485000	He's crinkling and crinkling.
485000	487000	The whole time you're talking,
487000	489000	there's a sound of one person eating chips
489000	491000	louder than chips need to be eaten.
491000	493000	All right, so do we want to fix him?
493000	495000	Do we want to fix him?
495000	497000	I think we can...
497000	499000	Adam, if you come on stage,
499000	501000	I'm going to put you at a full Nelson.
501000	503000	All right.
503000	506000	He was eating chips loud on purpose, right?
506000	507000	No, no.
507000	509000	I opened them after you said that.
509000	511000	No, you didn't.
511000	515000	No, willfully loud chip eating.
515000	517000	Because you're in the fourth row
517000	519000	for the first time ever.
519000	521000	You came here late and didn't get in the second row,
521000	523000	so you're eating chips at a fourth-row level right now.
523000	524000	I see Adam.
524000	525000	You have to hear you yell at me,
525000	526000	and it's worth it.
526000	529000	Keep it fucking down, man.
529000	531000	Good Christ.
531000	536000	So anyways, I've driven in here...
536000	539000	I have to write something down you said.
539000	542000	Much the same as the riboflavin and salt
542000	546000	in that bag of chips has made Adam uncontrollably...
546000	547000	Don't go on.
547000	550000	I'm just turning a page on my thing.
550000	553000	My search for truth has made me...
553000	555000	You don't have to put your hand that far in the bag
555000	557000	to get a chip out of it.
557000	559000	The bag is bigger than your wrist.
559000	562000	You can delicately insert your hand into a bag of chips
562000	563000	and get a chip.
563000	564000	Now I feel bad that I outed him.
564000	565000	No, it's too much.
565000	567000	We've all been the guy with the loud bag of chips.
567000	570000	No, not that loud, though. You haven't.
570000	571000	You haven't ever been that loud.
571000	573000	Because you would feel terrible
573000	575000	if other people heard you eating the chip.
575000	578000	He wants you to know he ate the chip.
578000	579000	You think he wants you to know he ate the chip?
579000	581000	Yes, yes, he does.
581000	584000	Adam Goldberg demands that you know that he has chips.
584000	589000	And now we're talking about it.
589000	593000	And now he's ascending into heaven right now.
593000	595000	He's sitting at the left hand of God.
595000	596000	All right.
596000	601000	Well, I want to keep talking about the weird tapioca in our brains
601000	604000	and what our endgame is.
604000	605000	What are we supposed to do?
605000	607000	I want to talk about morality.
607000	608000	Because there's something...
608000	610000	Do you notice how quiet it is right now?
610000	611000	It's fine, which is good.
611000	613000	Are all the chips gone?
614000	616000	Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, Jeff, you did great.
616000	617000	Okay, thank you.
617000	619000	Yes, I brought it up.
619000	620000	Adam, are you done with your chips?
620000	623000	Do you want to pour them into a bowl?
623000	625000	Now he's nodding in silence.
625000	626000	Good.
626000	628000	We've martyred him. He's behind the rock.
628000	630000	He's Joan of Arc.
630000	636000	We'll roll it aside in three days and it'll take over.
636000	642000	I want to talk about...
642000	646000	So often the big thing that it comes down to is we've got these big giant brains
646000	648000	and we figure out the things that we can do.
648000	650000	You can put a human ear on the back of a mouse.
650000	652000	You can wear glasses.
652000	653000	Now you can read a book.
653000	654000	There's a light bulb.
654000	656000	Now, nighttime isn't nighttime anymore.
656000	659000	Honestly, science wins.
659000	664000	It's the better religion, particularly because of the way it pursues its endeavors.
664000	667000	You lock hands and you say, what don't we know?
667000	668000	Let's figure out how to know it.
668000	671000	And let's not trust any crackpot who happens to be charismatic.
671000	675000	Just because he has weird hair and his tongue can hang out in the posters at Spencer's Gifts
675000	677000	doesn't mean that he's a better scientist.
677000	679000	Everything is peer review.
679000	682000	Everything is hypothesis and testing and proof.
682000	687000	And it's always up for debate, always up for act checking.
687000	692000	And slowly but surely, like an Amber Alert, we will close in on God
692000	697000	and we will find him and we will grab him and hug him for a second
697000	702000	and then slap his face and go, do you know how much you worried me?
702000	706000	That's science and that's the religion I approve of when it comes to a relationship with the unknown.
706000	714000	However, what it lacks, what it constantly lacks, what it conveniently lacks
714000	717000	is this thing that, for lack of a better word,
717000	723000	and there is a sincere, severe lack of a better word, morality.
723000	729000	That other thing, that feely thing, the umbilical thing,
729000	732000	the thing that connects you to the unknown thing,
732000	740000	the thing that makes you go, yeah, but...
740000	744000	Neither of these things can be given control over us.
744000	746000	We're so smart.
746000	747000	We keep figuring out how to do stuff.
747000	750000	We keep learning new things about why we are the way we are.
750000	755000	And every time we do, we go, okay, that means that nothing means anything anymore.
755000	759000	And then the other people are always going, yeah, but everything has always meant everything
759000	761000	and that means that you shouldn't even be learning these things.
761000	764000	And they're all assholes. We're all fucking idiots.
764000	767000	So we're not going to get to the bottom of it tonight,
767000	770000	but before we go to the moon, we've got to get our shit straight.
770000	777000	We've got to understand what constitutes, because I've said a million times before,
777000	780000	a dollar is a dollar, a dollar is worth a hundred pennies,
780000	782000	and a penny is worth a penny.
782000	785000	And that is fine. Capitalism works fine.
785000	790000	But we have to say that the human life is worth more than all of that.
790000	793000	It has to be a separate tier. It cannot be...
793000	797000	That's the flaw of capitalism. It's the flaw of humanity to the extent that it embraces capitalism.
797000	800000	So the big question has to be, before we get to the moon,
800000	804000	we better know if somebody hits their head on a rock and they start going,
804000	806000	I used to like purple, now I like yellow.
806000	810000	Yeah, but Commander, all the controls are set for purple.
810000	812000	Yeah, but yellow's the best.
812000	814000	Oh shit, he hit a...
814000	817000	We have to know what we define as human.
817000	821000	Is it efficacy? Is it utility?
821000	828000	Beefsteak Bill, who's been reborn from beef fungus pill, is raising his hand slightly.
828000	832000	Like, it's our ability to shoot.
832000	834000	You better come up if you...
834000	836000	This is heavy stuff.
836000	838000	Beefsteak Bill.
838000	841000	It's heavier than Breaking Bad, I think.
841000	842000	So far, yeah.
842000	845000	I mean, what's he going to do? He's going to use the machine gun in his trunk.
845000	848000	He's going to use it on one of three characters that are left.
848000	850000	You've been playing GTA.
850000	852000	Yeah, I have.
852000	857000	But also listening to radio labs about people having seizures that turn into pedophiles
857000	859000	because certain sections of their brain are coming.
859000	861000	What were you saying about free will, Bill?
861000	868000	Okay, I was watching a YouTube video from a Harvard professor who seemed to think that
868000	872000	the thing that we value the most is our ability to choose.
872000	878000	And to take away somebody else's ability to choose is by far the biggest crime you could ever make.
878000	880000	Because our entire religion, no matter...
880000	883000	And I think this spans the entire globe.
883000	890000	Every single origin myth has to do with humanity diverting from a sort of...
890000	893000	What would you call it? A nothingness.
893000	898000	By virtue of our desire to choose or our curse to choose.
898000	900000	And at that point, God...
900000	902000	I mean, the easiest example is Genesis.
902000	904000	God says, you chose.
904000	906000	Now for the rest of your life, you choose.
906000	907000	Fuck you.
907000	909000	Giraffes don't choose. Wolves don't choose.
909000	911000	Moss doesn't choose.
911000	913000	Have fun choosing, you pieces of shit.
913000	915000	And they don't have labor pains.
915000	917000	Your women now will.
917000	919000	Yeah, and now you're going to take a hoe to the earth
919000	921000	and it's going to...
921000	923000	You're going to break your back for nothing.
923000	925000	You've got everything you're going to experience.
925000	927000	You're a piece of shit because...
927000	931000	But in the warning to God before we ate that apple,
931000	934000	somebody said, you know, in that smoky room,
934000	936000	in one of the versions of Genesis, said,
936000	940000	oh, they're going to be like us.
940000	943000	If they eat that fruit.
943000	945000	That's a bit out there for me to follow.
945000	947000	Like, I don't know how to follow that.
947000	950000	That's to say that theologically, just supporting that.
950000	952000	Like, for thousands of years.
952000	954000	Continue, please.
954000	958000	There are some examples in the animal kingdom of cooperation,
958000	962000	and strangely enough, there's also examples of animals
962000	965000	fucking each other over.
965000	968000	One example is where they had two elephants
968000	972000	who were given rope to pull, and they had a pulley on it
972000	975000	so that if both of the elephants pulled at the same time,
976000	978000	they would bring the food to them.
978000	980000	And if only one of them pulled it,
980000	982000	the rope would just go through the pulley.
982000	986000	So, you know, the elephants didn't take too long to figure out
986000	988000	that they could cooperate and bring it over,
988000	990000	but it wasn't too long after that
990000	992000	that one of the elephants figured out
992000	994000	that if he just put his foot on the rope,
994000	996000	the other elephant would do all the work.
996000	999000	You did the same test they did with chimpanzees.
999000	1002000	The exact same test.
1002000	1004000	But it wasn't a foot on the rope.
1004000	1006000	It was simply not cooperation.
1006000	1008000	It was the alpha chimp would go over
1008000	1011000	and unlock the beta chimp and say,
1011000	1013000	okay, same deal, let's bring the food to me,
1013000	1015000	and the beta chimp, having been through
1015000	1017000	one iteration of the test, what?
1017000	1019000	Oh, you mean the test where you get all the food?
1019000	1021000	Fuck off.
1021000	1023000	And there's also been tests with monkeys
1023000	1027000	where they give cucumber and grapes,
1027000	1031000	and then if you underpay or give one set of monkeys
1031000	1033000	the cucumber, they get angry
1033000	1035000	that you didn't give them grapes.
1035000	1038000	So that's sort of along the same line.
1038000	1041000	But while you were talking about all that,
1041000	1044000	it reminded me of something I had been thinking about
1044000	1047000	for a while, that is the pillars of morality.
1047000	1050000	And there's a lot of people who talk about it
1050000	1053000	in different ways, and a lot of people say,
1053000	1055000	like, there's seven pillars of morality.
1055000	1059000	There's like the seven deadly sins and things like that
1059000	1062000	they used to illustrate, but the two pillars of morality,
1062000	1066000	are reciprocity and empathy.
1066000	1069000	And you can't have just one of those two things,
1069000	1072000	you need both of them.
1072000	1076000	The empathy allows you to know how to behave,
1076000	1082000	and the reciprocity is you actually doing it.
1082000	1085000	Like, you have to know that person needs a hug.
1085000	1088000	The reason that person's doing that is because they want a hug,
1088000	1090000	and then you have to hug them.
1090000	1094000	Empathy is broken into two separate...
1094000	1099000	I'm sorry, I haven't thought about this for a while now.
1099000	1102000	There's...
1102000	1104000	Oh, brain freeze.
1104000	1106000	Talk.
1106000	1108000	Choice.
1108000	1112000	You were holding a 40-ounce beer in your lap earlier.
1112000	1115000	Was that a 40 in a brown paper bag you were holding?
1115000	1116000	Yes.
1116000	1118000	I love you for that, by the way.
1119000	1122000	Everybody should have a 40-ounce in a brown paper bag.
1122000	1127000	You know, the government has beaten you to that idea.
1127000	1129000	It's not turning out so good.
1129000	1131000	What specifically does reciprocity mean?
1131000	1136000	Reciprocity, I mean, linguistically it just means
1136000	1138000	paying back whatever's been paid to you.
1138000	1140000	Kind of a quid pro quo, like if I get something,
1140000	1142000	I give something in return for that.
1142000	1144000	Like it could mean, it's not a moral attachment,
1144000	1145000	if you punch me in the face,
1145000	1147000	I'm reciprocating by punching you back in the face.
1147000	1149000	If you kiss me, I reciprocate by...
1149000	1153000	And from a societal level, reciprocity doesn't necessarily mean
1153000	1156000	that you pay the person who gave you something back,
1156000	1159000	but you can pay it forward, as it were.
1159000	1162000	Reciprocity isn't necessarily isolated to the two people
1162000	1164000	involved in the transaction.
1164000	1167000	Oh, well, now you're beyond me.
1167000	1169000	It's a future tense reciprocity.
1169000	1171000	Yeah, that's how I think about it.
1171000	1172000	You get up here too.
1172000	1174000	I may be wrong and it may be goofy,
1174000	1176000	but the way that I think about it,
1176000	1179000	and I think as illustrated by giving people stuff,
1179000	1184000	is I feel like reciprocity is more represented by Gandhi
1184000	1189000	and the idea that you sort of move things into the world
1189000	1191000	and then the world becomes like that.
1191000	1197000	Oh, so acting as if everything is the way that it should be.
1197000	1199000	Then the world reciprocates.
1199000	1201000	Yeah, you're going like, okay, well,
1201000	1205000	I'm not going to fall for the devil temptation of saying,
1205000	1207000	well, what if this and what if that?
1207000	1210000	I'm going to do the thing that I would do
1210000	1214000	if everybody did what everyone was supposed to do,
1214000	1217000	which is what someone does when they pick up an aluminum can
1217000	1219000	and drops it in a recycling bin
1219000	1221000	in spite of knowing that that single action
1221000	1224000	will absolutely not stop anything
1224000	1227000	that's going to make the earth die.
1227000	1229000	That person, what they're doing is they're saying
1229000	1232000	that that can be called reciprocation.
1232000	1233000	Yes.
1234000	1236000	I didn't know that.
1236000	1238000	The other thing I was talking about,
1238000	1242000	an empathy is broken into two different components.
1242000	1247000	There is affective, I think it is, and perceptive.
1247000	1250000	One type of empathy is your ability to perceive
1250000	1253000	how another person feels, and the other one is your ability
1253000	1256000	to know what to do to make the person feel better.
1256000	1258000	Without one of those two components,
1258000	1262000	you end up with either sociopaths who actually know what to do
1262000	1264000	but don't feel that they should,
1264000	1269000	or you end up with autistic people who know what to do
1269000	1272000	but have no idea when to do it.
1272000	1277000	The latter is if you know everything that everyone wants
1277000	1279000	all the time and you hate them for it,
1279000	1282000	is that you're probably autistic, right?
1284000	1286000	You're not a sociopath, for sure.
1286000	1288000	You're definitely more towards autistic.
1288000	1291000	Can you do a Jeff Foxworthy comedy routine?
1292000	1294000	You might be autistic.
1295000	1298000	It wouldn't be as funny as Jeff Foxworthy's video.
1298000	1299000	What was yours?
1299000	1300000	You can't make eye contact.
1300000	1302000	Yes, if you can't make eye contact,
1302000	1307000	but you know that you should, you might be autistic.
1308000	1311000	If someone tells you that they need a hug from you
1311000	1313000	to make themselves feel better,
1313000	1317000	and your thought is then you should respect me more,
1317000	1319000	you might be autistic.
1320000	1322000	Yeah, it's not funny.
1323000	1324000	It's a diagnosis.
1324000	1326000	Diagnoses aren't funny.
1329000	1332000	Did you know the diagnosis isn't funny?
1334000	1336000	All right, thank you Beef Steak Bill.
1336000	1337000	Beef Steak Bill!
1337000	1339000	Beef Steak Bill was...
1340000	1342000	Beef used to be Beef Fungus Bill,
1342000	1344000	and then he was lowered to the lava,
1344000	1347000	and he emerged as the Galvatron.
1348000	1350000	It's possible to reinvent yourself here.
1350000	1352000	Aaron did a very...
1352000	1353000	He was...
1353000	1356000	I mean, we spent 45 minutes talking about him.
1356000	1357000	Yeah, I listened to that.
1357000	1358000	It was fantastic.
1358000	1360000	How many levels will he have to go through
1360000	1362000	to get Beef out of his nickname?
1362000	1363000	Who knows?
1363000	1366000	He may one day end up being just...
1367000	1368000	Dr. Beef.
1368000	1371000	Maybe the next level is he just issues Bill.
1372000	1375000	He already has only one L in the word Bill.
1376000	1377000	That's vestigial.
1377000	1378000	Let him go.
1380000	1382000	Let's bring our good friends to the stage
1382000	1385000	faster than normal tonight as I got nothing,
1385000	1387000	but I want to talk to them about
1387000	1390000	brain-putting and morality and choices
1390000	1392000	and how you know the difference between good and bad,
1392000	1395000	because we have a quiet, intimate, awesome audience,
1395000	1397000	and we're gonna get to the fucking...
1397000	1399000	We're gonna make everyone jealous next episode.
1399000	1401000	We're embarking to the moon tonight.
1401000	1403000	Well, psychologically.
1403000	1404000	Yes.
1405000	1407000	I want everybody who comes next week,
1407000	1409000	everyone who listens to go,
1409000	1410000	shit, fuck!
1410000	1412000	Are you kidding me?
1412000	1414000	For Breaking Bad, I missed this?
1414000	1415000	Yeah.
1415000	1416000	What the people listening don't know is that
1416000	1418000	you've had your shirt off the entire time.
1420000	1421000	All right.
1421000	1423000	Kumail Nanjiani, can you come out here?
1428000	1429000	Hello, hello.
1432000	1433000	Nice.
1434000	1435000	I like that.
1436000	1438000	Kumail's wearing a t-shirt that has a very...
1438000	1439000	Is this a new thing?
1439000	1441000	The kind of watermark logo on the t-shirt?
1441000	1442000	Oh, does it look watermark?
1442000	1444000	It's just a free t-shirt I got at this place.
1444000	1446000	It says the contouring on it.
1446000	1448000	Do you think that's typical to that film
1448000	1452000	that it's sort of faded into the thread of the shirt,
1452000	1454000	or is that a new thing?
1454000	1455000	I think the movie...
1455000	1456000	Have you seen the movie?
1456000	1457000	No.
1457000	1458000	It sort of captures the vibe of the movie.
1458000	1460000	Shrab talked about it last week.
1460000	1461000	Did he like it?
1461000	1462000	I don't think so.
1462000	1463000	I can't remember.
1464000	1465000	You liked it?
1465000	1467000	I have a theory on morality.
1467000	1468000	I don't know.
1468000	1469000	It's not a novel.
1469000	1471000	But I think what makes us human
1471000	1475000	is a complexity of language and society,
1475000	1478000	and I think morality is just what you need
1478000	1479000	to live in a society.
1479000	1480000	That's where it comes from.
1480000	1482000	And how I think it ties into science
1482000	1485000	is that the brains that are made
1485000	1487000	to sort of be able to differentiate
1487000	1488000	right and wrong,
1488000	1490000	i.e. what works in a society and what doesn't,
1490000	1493000	are the ones evolutionarily that'll stick around.
1493000	1494000	So for instance,
1494000	1496000	if you have a brain that makes you fuck kids,
1496000	1497000	you're not going to have any more kids,
1497000	1499000	because kids can't have kids,
1499000	1500000	so you'll go away.
1502000	1503000	So I think that's...
1503000	1504000	Wait, wait, wait.
1504000	1506000	Kids can't have kids?
1506000	1508000	Like, you know, like a three-year-old,
1508000	1510000	I don't think can have a kid.
1510000	1511000	And I don't think...
1511000	1513000	Pedophiles, I think, draw the line at like 14,
1513000	1516000	because then I think that's when we kind of take over, you know?
1520000	1521000	Not that we're...
1521000	1522000	We who?
1522000	1523000	We who?
1523000	1524000	Listen, come on, bro.
1524000	1525000	You see...
1525000	1526000	Everybody!
1526000	1527000	Don't bro me.
1527000	1528000	Don't bro me on 14.
1528000	1529000	Hey, listen.
1529000	1531000	You've seen some 16-year-olds where you're like,
1531000	1532000	all right, call me...
1532000	1534000	You said 14 first, by the way.
1534000	1536000	I was trying to make a point.
1536000	1539000	Well, you know, with the hormones and milk these days,
1539000	1540000	and I don't know.
1540000	1544000	See, but look how fun it is to frolic in that surf,
1544000	1545000	and we all go,
1545000	1547000	oh, you, and, and, and, and, and,
1547000	1549000	and then there's the six-foot drop-off
1549000	1552000	that we all go, don't go out there.
1552000	1556000	Well, but I really don't think it's that if all of us want to do it,
1556000	1557000	and we know not to,
1557000	1561000	I think it's a messed-up broken brain that wants to do it,
1561000	1563000	because evolutionarily and scientifically,
1563000	1566000	it doesn't make sense to be attracted to a child.
1566000	1569000	It's not what leads to the survival of our species.
1569000	1571000	So when he got that thing cut out of his brain,
1571000	1573000	it fucked him up.
1573000	1576000	By the way, we should all be lucky that we hit the lottery
1576000	1578000	of not being attracted to kids, like...
1578000	1581000	That could have been something that could have happened to us.
1581000	1582000	But this is what I'm talking about.
1582000	1585000	Why do we act like they are, like...
1585000	1587000	And first I'm going to say,
1587000	1592000	this is a daisy chain of weird logic that I want to lead possibly to nowhere,
1592000	1595000	because greater men than me have tried to think about this.
1595000	1598000	But the first, first link of the daisy chain is to go,
1598000	1602000	why do we act like a guy who wants to fuck a three-year-old
1602000	1607000	is the same as a Nazi war criminal that we're trying to hunt down and go,
1607000	1609000	no, you fucked up.
1609000	1611000	You thought you were back on the right horse.
1611000	1612000	You made a choice.
1612000	1615000	Because they did make a choice to fuck a kid.
1615000	1617000	You can want to fuck a kid.
1617000	1618000	No, no, no, no.
1618000	1621000	Okay, well, let's wipe that off the magnet part.
1621000	1623000	The obvious, yeah.
1623000	1626000	Like actually hurting a kid affecting their future,
1626000	1629000	which then vampirically turns them probably,
1629000	1632000	as we've seen, into another abuser of children.
1632000	1633000	That's the problem.
1633000	1635000	That's 90% of the problem.
1636000	1640000	But the impulse itself, the hard drive,
1640000	1645000	the guy who wants to look at a calendar
1645000	1650000	where January is a three-year-old kid laying on a fur rug in front of a fireplace.
1650000	1651000	All right.
1651000	1655000	Okay, so I feel like the printer would have a couple questions,
1655000	1659000	but I don't know if he can mass produce that.
1659000	1661000	Say, is my calendar ready?
1661000	1663000	That's kind of a DIY kind of thing.
1664000	1666000	Yeah, collage, scissors.
1666000	1668000	The impulse, the predilection.
1668000	1670000	Like, why?
1670000	1675000	I know the answer, I think, is because it's easy.
1675000	1684000	Because we all, as Americans, we lack outlets for outrage.
1684000	1691000	We think, we're encouraged to be fucking loud.
1692000	1694000	We're encouraged to...
1694000	1699000	Emily Post did not write the rules to American society.
1699000	1702000	It's sort of very ethnocentric.
1702000	1704000	It's just knowing what's happening here.
1704000	1709000	And what's happening here has been happening here for the last eight years.
1709000	1712000	If you go back further than eight years now,
1712000	1715000	this is like Alexis de Tocqueville on Overdrive.
1715000	1720000	What came before us, we have no respect for it.
1720000	1721000	We spit on it.
1721000	1722000	We don't care.
1722000	1724000	You like John Ritter?
1724000	1725000	You thought he was funny?
1725000	1726000	Go fuck yourself.
1726000	1731000	Like, we've burrowed into ourselves.
1734000	1737000	Originally, us doing that took over the planet.
1737000	1738000	Yeah.
1738000	1740000	We said, fuck culture.
1740000	1741000	Fuck bloodlines.
1741000	1743000	Fuck heredity.
1743000	1745000	Fuck learning.
1745000	1750000	Fuck everything but what's going on right here, right now.
1750000	1752000	But it was a glorious...
1752000	1755000	Thomas Edison took that ball and ran with it.
1755000	1756000	This is sort of a weird thing.
1756000	1761000	But right after September 11th, 2001, I can't believe I have to specify that.
1761000	1764000	But I was here, and I had some...
1764000	1770000	I sort of podcast listeners, I'm a brown-skinned man.
1770000	1773000	I had people yell stuff at me, and a lot of times,
1773000	1775000	and this is just what happened.
1775000	1778000	I'm not putting any judgment on any sort of higher point
1778000	1782000	except that there were a lot of black people who said really bad stuff to me.
1782000	1785000	And I'm like, you should understand what discrimination feels like
1785000	1788000	because you go through it every day.
1788000	1790000	Why can you not put yourself in my shoes
1790000	1792000	and understand that it's the same thing that's happening?
1792000	1795000	It's because we just want to...
1795000	1796000	I don't know what it is.
1796000	1798000	Well, it's like there's the kick-the-dog theory,
1798000	1801000	that any pain that's put on you,
1801000	1804000	if you get yelled at by your boss, you yell at the person beneath him,
1804000	1806000	and he yells at his wife, and she yells at the son,
1806000	1808000	and the son kicks the dog, and the dog can't...
1808000	1811000	Right now, we're the dog.
1811000	1819000	Do you think that if a black person exalts in doing that to you,
1819000	1823000	is that just kind of the joy of having someone to do that?
1823000	1824000	It's reciprocation.
1824000	1825000	It's reciprocation.
1825000	1826000	Without empathy.
1826000	1828000	Patriotic reciprocation.
1828000	1829000	Paying it forward.
1829000	1832000	Paying it forward.
1832000	1833000	Yeah.
1833000	1841000	I think that is the history of what white racists are fond of evoking
1841000	1843000	turn-of-the-century kind of like...
1843000	1846000	Remember what the Irish did and the Jewish had to do?
1846000	1849000	You know, when they hear...
1849000	1853000	Reverse, reverse racism often is...
1853000	1857000	The idea is, oh, all kinds of people had it bad over here
1857000	1860000	in this melting pot.
1860000	1865000	What they're sort of lifting up and celebrating is actually part of the problem,
1865000	1867000	which is that shit rolls downhill,
1867000	1873000	that you don't end up, when you've been at the end of a stick,
1873000	1878000	you typically do not end up grabbing the stick out of the hand that's holding it
1878000	1881000	and beating the face of the person that held it.
1881000	1885000	You typically end up, you know, kind of coming into your own,
1886000	1889000	like, oh, I got a little star in my chest now.
1889000	1891000	Remember when I was just getting hit?
1891000	1893000	Now I'm hitting people.
1893000	1895000	But it's not typically the guy that was hitting you.
1895000	1901000	But I think it's interesting to sort of think of morality as...
1901000	1904000	You know, if you think of it, you said something,
1904000	1906000	oh, why do we judge people?
1906000	1909000	Not judge, but why do we like demonize people who are attracted to kids?
1909000	1913000	Because it's against what makes a society work,
1913000	1916000	because it gets fucked up kids, and these kids are not going to go to work.
1916000	1920000	But why don't we look at them the same way we look at someone who has a cold,
1920000	1923000	when someone has snot dripping down their face,
1923000	1925000	which makes them disgusting.
1925000	1927000	Because it's easier, but if someone walks...
1927000	1928000	Oh, wait.
1928000	1931000	You can't say it's easier to judge pedophiles and walk on stage.
1931000	1934000	It's a big victory lap.
1934000	1937000	No, but here's what it...
1937000	1939000	Adam, it must be said to the listener,
1939000	1942000	is standing one third the way toward the stage right now.
1942000	1945000	What can only be described as an ominous pose.
1945000	1946000	I really...
1946000	1950000	Having stated themselves on chips...
1950000	1954000	Because I think being attracted to kids is not a crime.
1954000	1956000	Acting on it is.
1956000	1958000	Yes.
1958000	1961000	And so I think those people, our brains are made...
1961000	1962000	Oh, hey, Adam.
1962000	1964000	Hello, Adam.
1964000	1966000	For a different perspective.
1966000	1970000	I agree with Camille's point, but I want to say,
1970000	1973000	the reason that it's so easy to kick shit down...
1973000	1975000	By the way, I just want to say one thing.
1975000	1980000	There's not a lot of people here, but don't say anything you'll regret.
1980000	1983000	Don't reveal too much while you're defending.
1983000	1986000	No, it's because the reason that it's so fun to be like,
1986000	1988000	well, I was being kicked around school.
1988000	1989000	I used to be bullied.
1989000	1990000	Now I'm the bully.
1990000	1994000	It's because you see the part of yourself that's ready to be bullied again.
1994000	1998000	You have to fill yourself up with the confidence that says,
1998000	2002000	well, I'm not going to be victimized because I'm victimizing someone else that hard.
2002000	2003000	Sure, yeah.
2003000	2008000	It's the same reason we have a lot of closeted religious people,
2008000	2011000	and they're the ones who are most going after homosexuals.
2011000	2012000	And I also... Yeah, sorry.
2012000	2013000	Yeah, you use your rage.
2013000	2016000	It feels good to turn someone else into the scapegoat,
2016000	2017000	because you're not the scapegoat.
2017000	2019000	Because everyone has the same fiber they're being.
2019000	2021000	We all have the same biological organism.
2021000	2023000	We all have the same teeth in our mouth,
2023000	2027000	and we all have the same weird fucking aggressive bullshit.
2027000	2031000	But the weird thing is all of us have to take shits.
2031000	2033000	I've said this a million times before.
2033000	2037000	I say certain things, and as people say, yeah, but people want to do this,
2037000	2039000	especially about my thoughts about hierarchy.
2039000	2044000	And I'm very, very... I don't want to say resentful of this,
2044000	2049000	but when I talk about hierarchy, when I talk about anarchy versus hierarchy,
2049000	2051000	and anarchy is simply... It's not lawlessness.
2051000	2053000	It's not lack of order.
2053000	2054000	It's simply the lack of hierarchy.
2054000	2059000	And then I'll get the Reddit sub-thread thing.
2059000	2063000	People will chime in from Alaska, from their little dungeons.
2063000	2067000	Well, Dan Harmon, if you don't like hierarchy, why do you have a harm in town?
2067000	2068000	How about that?
2068000	2069000	Yeah, exactly.
2069000	2071000	Why are you standing and talking on a stage?
2071000	2073000	Is that the opposite of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?
2073000	2076000	Isn't hierarchy inherent to human beings?
2076000	2078000	Isn't it instinctive?
2078000	2083000	Shit-taking is inherent to human beings.
2083000	2087000	Hoop comes out of your butt so many times a day.
2087000	2090000	We are not walking around in an average way.
2090000	2092000	How many times on average?
2092000	2093000	That should be average of one.
2093000	2094000	Six to seven.
2094000	2095000	Whoa.
2095000	2096000	Okay.
2096000	2097000	There's a lot of fiber.
2097000	2099000	We should talk about that first.
2099000	2102000	We're going to be in a spaceship to the moon together.
2102000	2103000	Yeah.
2103000	2107000	We were going to make it to the moon, but then Dan shit into our toilet.
2107000	2110000	Believe me, Hermitown 1, the castle that goes first,
2110000	2111000	is just your shit.
2111000	2113000	That's 90% bathroom.
2113000	2114000	Here's the thing.
2114000	2116000	I think the ultimate sort of...
2116000	2118000	Because there's going to be a tub in there.
2118000	2120000	It's not going to shower while we're going to the moon.
2120000	2123000	I think human nature, which is what you're talking about, Goldberg,
2123000	2126000	and you guys are talking about, which is sort of the urge,
2126000	2131000	like be better than someone, is so at odds with what a just sustainable society is.
2131000	2133000	And that's the problem, I think.
2133000	2137000	If you think of the Nazi society, that's not a sustainable society.
2137000	2138000	Taliban, that's not a sustainable society.
2138000	2142000	A sustainable society has no hierarchy like what you're saying.
2142000	2144000	I think there are people that would say that compassion,
2144000	2146000	if there was a community that was compassionate
2146000	2149000	and they cared for the elderly and they looked after the sick
2149000	2154000	and they dealt as a group with criminal elements
2154000	2158000	or maybe psychotic or psychopathic elements or antisocial elements,
2158000	2159000	that would be great.
2159000	2160000	That would be awesome.
2160000	2161000	But nothing would get invented.
2161000	2162000	Nothing would get done.
2162000	2165000	I think people say that it's that drive of competition
2165000	2171000	that capitalist competitiveness creates our ability to grow
2171000	2176000	and to drive to succeed, which I think may or may not be true.
2176000	2180000	I think what societies lack, especially when capitalism is involved,
2180000	2184000	is simple compassion because it's not sexy.
2184000	2187000	It doesn't get anybody anywhere.
2187000	2190000	There's no reciprocity in that.
2190000	2193000	There's no barter system in compassion.
2193000	2197000	That should be the paying forward of if I do something right
2197000	2201000	and the golden rule, do, and I think all major religions say
2201000	2206000	in some way or other, do unto others what you'd have them do.
2206000	2210000	Some would say don't do unto others what you wouldn't want them to do to you.
2210000	2212000	But I think the better way to say it is imperative
2212000	2214000	to actually go out of your way and do something
2214000	2219000	that you're doing for no profit at all because it profits many.
2219000	2222000	The society, that's the most basic tenet that a society is built on.
2222000	2225000	Do unto others what you would have them do to you.
2225000	2227000	You watch people, especially in big cities,
2227000	2231000	let's say you're a creative person, you're an artist,
2231000	2233000	you're a writer, you're a painter,
2233000	2236000	and you're driven to do something creative
2236000	2239000	and you're watching people that have this other thing called ambition
2239000	2243000	and they're not as talented as you, but they're really fucking good in a room
2243000	2246000	and they're really driven and they're at a party.
2246000	2248000	They're like, you should be talking to that person.
2248000	2251000	No, I don't like talking to people. I like painting. Fuck you.
2251000	2253000	And I'll go home and paint for fucking free.
2253000	2255000	And meanwhile, you said how many watch the Amazon,
2255000	2259000	you watch a bunch of people that some got lucky and were artists
2259000	2261000	and it all happened.
2261000	2263000	And you also surrounded a room full of people
2263000	2267000	that I think are absolute con artists and bullies and dickheads.
2267000	2270000	I'm going to go the other direction on this one for you, Jeff.
2270000	2272000	Because it's not a binary.
2272000	2275000	It's not a binary between capitalist and anarchist
2275000	2278000	because a lot of the things that we give credit for for capitalism
2278000	2280000	happen under protectionist governments.
2280000	2283000	Happen because you couldn't buy grain from England
2283000	2286000	for a lot of the 19th century, for the 20th century.
2286000	2289000	You couldn't buy cars from Japan until suddenly you could
2289000	2293000	and then the 80s were filled with the idea, oh, Japan's going to take over.
2293000	2296000	But the part that really, it's not a duality
2296000	2298000	between being ambitious and being creative.
2298000	2300000	It's not a knob that you turn one way or the other.
2300000	2303000	There's nothing wrong with getting paid what you're worth.
2303000	2306000	There's nothing wrong with learning to be the person who talks a little,
2306000	2308000	you know, kisses a little ass.
2308000	2310000	The motivation is blind ambition.
2310000	2314000	There's people that are motivated simply by the need to rise up a ladder.
2314000	2316000	And that's society.
2316000	2319000	That's Parisian culture and the restoration.
2319000	2322000	I'm just simply using people to get your ends out of things.
2322000	2324000	It's why Rome fell.
2324000	2329000	But we've slid into, I mean, all of these are choices.
2329000	2331000	We're all choosing the words that we're going to say.
2331000	2333000	We're all forming policy.
2333000	2334000	We're going to talk politics.
2334000	2335000	We're going to talk philosophy.
2335000	2337000	We're going to talk about the people that came before us,
2337000	2340000	the mistakes that they've made, the problem with the way things are,
2340000	2343000	the true motivation of the people around us and all these things.
2343000	2346000	But at the core, at a deeper core of that,
2346000	2350000	we don't even have our shit together enough to look at a guy
2350000	2354000	who hit his head so hard that he wants to fuck a three-year-old
2354000	2357000	and go, are you all right?
2357000	2360000	We want to arrest that person.
2360000	2362000	That's the problem.
2362000	2366000	Like, we can't endure the equivalent of a head cold
2366000	2368000	in terms of personality.
2368000	2370000	We can't allow anyone to have a bad day.
2370000	2373000	Well, then, OK, what do you propose we do with that person?
2373000	2374000	I don't know.
2374000	2376000	I propose that we stop proposing
2376000	2380000	because we are more jellyfish.
2380000	2382000	We are 90% jellyfish.
2382000	2385000	We share more DNA with a watermelon than we do
2385000	2387000	with whatever we haven't discovered yet.
2387000	2391000	We are acquiesce characters.
2391000	2393000	We are things that flow.
2393000	2398000	We just finished eating each other's faces and genitals off
2398000	2401000	under a tree fighting for shade.
2401000	2403000	We have risen so much.
2403000	2404000	It was a really great tree.
2404000	2405000	It was a great tree.
2405000	2406000	I'm talking about the 50s.
2406000	2410000	That was the last time in town at the podcast festival.
2410000	2414000	The 1950s were a rough time for all of us, Dan.
2414000	2416000	Oh, man.
2416000	2419000	The idea that there's a threshold that we have to cross.
2419000	2421000	There's a threshold that we have to cross.
2422000	2425000	Be reminded of our frailty.
2425000	2427000	When you see somebody who's been bonked in the head,
2427000	2428000	when you see somebody who's homeless,
2428000	2430000	when you see somebody who's having a bad week
2430000	2434000	or having a bad time, being reminded of our frailty is terrifying.
2434000	2437000	Being reminded of the fact that the conscious personality,
2437000	2442000	the person that you interact with in line at a football stadium,
2442000	2447000	when you engage in the wonderful, beautiful act
2447000	2449000	of not ripping another primate's face off
2450000	2452000	while you're waiting in line for a beer,
2452000	2455000	when we drive to and from work every day,
2455000	2458000	the entire planet, all of these lights that you see
2458000	2462000	as you fly in these aircraft that don't go down over these cities
2462000	2465000	where there aren't explosions happening
2465000	2467000	because it's not World War Z yet,
2467000	2472000	be reminded of the fact that this outward face
2472000	2474000	that creates all that compatibility,
2474000	2477000	clearly by the fact that America's prison population
2477000	2479000	is rising and rising and rising.
2479000	2486000	We obviously are capable of functioning in society
2486000	2491000	with a certain amount, repressing a certain amount of the animal within.
2491000	2496000	We are now at a point where we need to grow up enough
2496000	2499000	to accept the animal within.
2499000	2503000	The internet is creating glory holes
2504000	2510000	in the wall between everything that you're allowed to say in line at the bank
2510000	2514000	and everything that you actually think and feel.
2514000	2519000	And they're spurting out, creating these little, like, seismic,
2519000	2521000	these yellowstone...
2521000	2523000	Seismic dents.
2523000	2527000	And our reaction is we're flocking to those and we're going,
2527000	2529000	look at this unfortunate...
2529000	2531000	No, we're hitting them with hammers
2531000	2534000	and creating ones a little down the line that we can stick our dicks in.
2534000	2537000	We are obviously a gigantic...
2537000	2539000	Whack-a-mole.
2539000	2541000	We are fucked up people.
2541000	2543000	We are, but okay, here's going back to when I said,
2543000	2545000	what do you propose we do?
2545000	2547000	And you said, I propose to not propose,
2547000	2550000	but how does society deal with someone who's fucking kids?
2550000	2553000	Like, at the core of it, like, what do you say we do?
2553000	2555000	We have to demonize that person.
2555000	2557000	Lauren, take the stage.
2557000	2560000	Finally, let's get a woman up on the stage of douchebag men.
2560000	2562000	Can we please...
2562000	2564000	Yeah, get your chair.
2564000	2566000	Adam, you can...
2566000	2568000	She just...
2568000	2570000	Shit rolls downhill, Lauren.
2570000	2573000	Spencer to the stage to take Adam's mic away from him.
2573000	2575000	Spencer!
2575000	2578000	I think you know who you were in that metaphor.
2578000	2580000	Yeah, get up there.
2580000	2582000	Yeah.
2582000	2586000	Adam tried to usurp Spencer's throne and I will not have that.
2586000	2588000	I'm sorry, Adam.
2588000	2590000	I'm not really wanting to engage in this discussion
2590000	2594000	because I lived in Amsterdam studying gender and sexuality for a while
2594000	2597000	and we actually interviewed pedophiles.
2597000	2600000	There was, like, the day that pedophiles...
2600000	2603000	Did you lure them with, like, kids?
2603000	2605000	Oh, hey, you're one.
2605000	2607000	Couple questions.
2607000	2609000	Was that a playground?
2609000	2611000	Yeah, no, there was, like, it was really weird.
2611000	2615000	It was, like, on the syllabus, like, the day that pedophiles are coming to class.
2615000	2618000	Can I ask you one very basic question?
2618000	2621000	When I throw a pedophile in my head, I have a specific...
2621000	2622000	Yes.
2622000	2623000	What did it look like? Like that?
2623000	2624000	Yes.
2624000	2625000	Okay.
2625000	2629000	Wait, they showed up saying, hello, I'm a pedophile.
2629000	2631000	They're out of the closet about it?
2631000	2634000	Yeah, some people don't like fucking kids and there's me.
2634000	2635000	Hi, I'm right.
2635000	2636000	James Robinson's the name.
2636000	2639000	Pedophilia is the game.
2639000	2640000	They were...
2640000	2644000	This was the Netherlands, so you have to keep that in mind.
2644000	2646000	Well, they're very...
2646000	2649000	The Dutch have been fucking kids for centuries.
2649000	2652000	You can just go into coffee shops when you find it.
2652000	2656000	There's whole restaurants where it's just kids on platters.
2656000	2658000	They're just very open about it.
2658000	2659000	Anyway...
2659000	2661000	But they don't like pedophilia, right?
2661000	2662000	No, no, no.
2662000	2664000	Like, both of these guys have been to jail.
2664000	2667000	Yeah, so there's a hard line between what they're open about and pedophilia.
2667000	2668000	But go ahead, sorry.
2668000	2672000	No, what they're open about is talking about it and researching it and that sort of thing.
2672000	2677000	Anyway, so yeah, they came to class and it was these two guys and one of them was like,
2677000	2681000	yeah, I really like five-year-old girls.
2681000	2682000	It was creepy.
2682000	2685000	No, I had a big problem with it.
2685000	2686000	But you're studying it.
2686000	2687000	You're creeped out by it.
2687000	2688000	Yeah, yeah.
2688000	2690000	Okay, all right, continue.
2690000	2696000	What they talked about was their mission is to not fuck children.
2696000	2698000	Yeah, so that's their struggle.
2698000	2699000	I have to not run red lights.
2699000	2700000	They have to not...
2700000	2701000	Yeah, totally.
2701000	2706000	I'm just saying we all have these struggles and the moral choice is to not do the immoral thing.
2706000	2707000	Okay, go ahead.
2707000	2711000	And it didn't make them any less creepy.
2711000	2716000	They talked openly about how they had to work to avoid going to playgrounds
2716000	2719000	and inviting little boys to sit on their lap.
2719000	2720000	Yeah.
2720000	2725000	So their AA is saying, I'm six months sober off of fucking children.
2725000	2726000	Yeah, totally.
2726000	2730000	And not just fucking them, but looking at them.
2730000	2733000	They have to avoid situations where they're around children.
2733000	2734000	Sure, yeah.
2734000	2735000	Otherwise...
2735000	2736000	What were you going to say, Camille?
2736000	2738000	You get a little chipped.
2738000	2739000	You get a little chipped.
2739000	2741000	It's been six months.
2741000	2745000	And then everyone claps like, great, good for you.
2745000	2748000	I had a relapse last night.
2748000	2749000	But here's the thing.
2749000	2751000	That's what I'm saying, Dan.
2751000	2754000	I don't understand what you're saying when you say...
2754000	2755000	How are you proposing?
2755000	2758000	Why is our attitude towards pedophilia wrong?
2758000	2763000	We sat on the stage and talked about the topic of people who get turned on by eating shit
2763000	2766000	or being shit on or shitting on other people came up.
2766000	2770000	And immediately we defaulted to as hilarious as it is.
2770000	2773000	Like letting those people know, should one of them be in the audience,
2773000	2777000	letting those people know that what they need to do is continue to be ashamed of themselves.
2777000	2781000	At the same time, anytime we say something even slightly wrong politically,
2781000	2783000	we get immediately fucking...
2783000	2787000	Some poor girl came up here whose only crime was what?
2787000	2789000	Being part of a fucking bell curve mentality,
2789000	2792000	like saying something that eight years ago would have functioned
2792000	2795000	as something that progressively to say about gay people
2795000	2799000	and immediately got jumped on by this LA fucking...
2799000	2803000	Well, I wasn't here for that, but I think you can hold people accountable for their opinions.
2803000	2807000	I think people can be wrong, and it's okay to say that they're wrong.
2807000	2809000	Again, I didn't listen to that episode, but...
2809000	2812000	I said there are people that want to be pooped on, people that want to be peed on,
2812000	2816000	people who want to dress as a lizard, people who want to fuck a dog, people who want to suck a dog's dick.
2816000	2819000	Okay, now my dog's involved.
2819000	2820000	Now your dog's involved.
2820000	2821000	It's a fuzzy line, it's a fuzzy line.
2821000	2822000	Is the dog into it?
2822000	2824000	But we're not...
2824000	2831000	I think the fundamental plexiglass between my Indiana Jones and your cobra right now is that...
2831000	2835000	Why am I the cobra? I'm the one against pedophiles.
2835000	2837000	How am I the cobra?
2837000	2839000	You're right. Sorry, I'll flip them, I'll flip them.
2839000	2840000	Sorry, I'm the cobra.
2840000	2841000	No, no, no, go ahead, go ahead.
2841000	2844000	Is that...
2844000	2849000	Anyone who's doing anything that's hurting another person, blah, blah, blah...
2849000	2854000	It seems like there's a clean line there where it's like you're...
2854000	2859000	The problem that I'm talking about is that what we do is we're...
2859000	2866000	Because that's a reprehensible concept, the internet has created this idea.
2866000	2871000	It's like, come on, I've been on 4chan.
2871000	2875000	You can computer generate images now.
2875000	2884000	So you can make an eight foot blue woman with a giant cock fucking a three foot ewok.
2884000	2891000	And the dick is coming up out of her mouth because the blue woman's dick is fucking it so hard.
2891000	2894000	So the blue woman's dick is over three feet long.
2894000	2896000	Yeah, someone's jerking off to this.
2896000	2898000	Someone's making it, someone's jerking off.
2898000	2899000	I'm fine with that.
2899000	2904000	I'm also fine with, if you're attracted to kids, drawing a picture of a kid and masturbating to it.
2904000	2905000	I'm fine with that.
2905000	2909000	But when there's a victim, when there's a crime, well then there's nobody...
2909000	2910000	Okay, yeah.
2910000	2914000	I want that on TMZ tomorrow.
2914000	2920000	Camille Nanciani was quoted last night as saying, I'm fine with jerking off to a picture of...
2920000	2922000	Okay, so way out of context.
2922000	2923000	No, it's not.
2923000	2925000	That was in context.
2925000	2928000	No, but I'm saying when there's a victim, everything changes.
2928000	2931000	If the victim is a dog or a child, everything changes.
2931000	2932000	But we're not talking...
2932000	2935000	I'm talking about perception, morality, pornography.
2935000	2937000	Wait, wait, wait.
2937000	2939000	You're standing up and have your hand up.
2939000	2941000	No, I just wanted to try this.
2941000	2942000	Come on up here.
2942000	2943000	Come here.
2943000	2944000	Show my mic.
2946000	2949000	What we're basically talking about is consent.
2950000	2959000	In our country particularly, each state even has this ability to say at what age you are
2959000	2965000	allowed to say yes and your mind has developed enough to say yes to activities.
2965000	2970000	We demonize pedophilia because in our country...
2970000	2973000	Because we're worried about people looking at stuff.
2973000	2978000	The same way we worry about Dungeons and Dragons when I was 12, by the way.
2978000	2980000	I'm increasing.
2980000	2983000	I'm wading into the tarpets of being a pedophilia advocate.
2983000	2985000	You really are.
2985000	2990000	Because are you suggesting that in 20 years you'll be like, hey, those people were okay
2990000	2991000	and they were fucking pissed?
2991000	2993000	But that's part of the problem, though.
2993000	2994000	I want to be like a weird...
2994000	2997000	I want to be a reciprocist, you know?
2997000	3001000	I want to actually make the fucking headway of going, you know what?
3001000	3003000	Even though it's not...
3003000	3009000	The easiest thing in the world for everyone collectively is to go, well, looking at a
3009000	3014000	picture of this or reading a story about this, we can all agree that's disgusting and the
3014000	3020000	reason is because it's directly linked to behavior that is the definition of criminal.
3020000	3023000	And immoral, yes.
3023000	3026000	So then we scale that one back.
3026000	3027000	It's like we're in the surf.
3027000	3034000	In the surf, the internet is creating a surf between the unconscious and conscious minds
3034000	3039000	and it's like people are...
3039000	3040000	What would I propose?
3040000	3041000	I don't know.
3041000	3049000	I would propose that we propose less because we're being very, very clear as the internet
3049000	3050000	is...
3050000	3056000	And believe me, like 30 years from now, I'll be six feet in the ground and I think I'm
3056000	3057000	pretty sure...
3057000	3060000	Give yourself 40 years or so.
3060000	3061000	All right.
3061000	3062000	Maybe if I cut down...
3062000	3064000	You wonder the doctor and your doctor...
3064000	3067000	I'll be watching this from my porch on the rocking chair.
3067000	3071000	But people are going to be flicking a switch, you know, on the back of their head or whatever
3071000	3078000	the equivalent is and you're going to be able to simulate you're an octopus and your neighbor's
3078000	3083000	dog is coming over for tea and you've got eight dicks to fuck at work.
3083000	3090000	That's the thing, though, is that if you're doing it by yourself and there's nobody else
3090000	3093000	involved and it's a simulation, that's one thing.
3093000	3097000	But as soon as you involve an unwilling participant and that's why children, it's so difficult
3097000	3102000	because we consider it after younger than a certain age that they don't have the ability
3102000	3103000	to comprehend the decision.
3103000	3104000	I don't think it's difficult.
3104000	3106000	I think it's a very easy line to draw.
3106000	3107000	No, no, no.
3107000	3112000	She's saying it's difficult to allow for freedom of expression, freedom of choice.
3112000	3116000	She comes to that on that surf because the action...
3116000	3120000	Right, because the action is suddenly inhibiting somebody else's freedom.
3120000	3126000	And because the connection is between you're dealing with people who are easily victimizable,
3126000	3129000	like you're talking about a person who is...
3129000	3132000	We're protecting this person for precisely the same reason.
3132000	3137000	Before there was an internet, you could prey on a saber-toothed tiger could eat them more readily.
3137000	3140000	So you're talking about like, okay, when I...
3140000	3142000	Everyone, say your favorite ice cream flavor.
3142000	3145000	I love to go to fuckafortyearold.com.
3145000	3149000	We can't just readily go, hey, have at it.
3149000	3152000	That's a terrible ice cream flavor.
3152000	3154000	But so it ties into...
3154000	3158000	We can't do that because we go, well, I cannot allow...
3158000	3162000	Like Meghan's law was adopted because...
3162000	3164000	What is Meghan's law?
3164000	3169000	Meghan's law in California is because there was a girl, like she was...
3169000	3170000	I don't know.
3170000	3172000	Something horrible happened to her.
3172000	3179000	And she basically lived across the street from a guy who was a sex offender who was registered,
3179000	3182000	but the registration was not...
3182000	3183000	Public.
3183000	3184000	Yeah.
3184000	3185000	Public.
3185000	3190000	So now that's why they have to go door to door and be like, listen, I have this weird calendar.
3190000	3191000	Right.
3192000	3196000	I have the octopus in my neighbor's dog calendar.
3196000	3197000	Yeah.
3197000	3198000	Yeah.
3198000	3200000	May is my fave.
3200000	3202000	So scale away during that month.
3202000	3204000	And picture really gets me going.
3204000	3207000	Along with everything else, there's another surf you've created now.
3207000	3214000	There's another beach because there are people who water skied by their...
3214000	3220000	You know, they got a little drunk and they water skied naked past a family at a beach picnic.
3220000	3221000	And they're registered.
3221000	3222000	Okay.
3222000	3223000	But that's different.
3223000	3226000	But what I'm saying is you're giving them the credit.
3226000	3227000	But I'm not talking about creating policy.
3227000	3233000	All I'm saying is every time you scout out these...
3233000	3236000	Every time we pretend that we know the difference between right and wrong,
3236000	3240000	all we really create is more sand and more water, like another beach.
3240000	3241000	That's...
3241000	3243000	I don't know the answers.
3243000	3244000	Yeah.
3244000	3245000	I'm...
3245000	3246000	Sorry.
3246000	3247000	Go ahead.
3247000	3250000	What you're talking about is the difference between fantasy
3250000	3252000	and having fantasies and acting on them.
3252000	3253000	And I know...
3253000	3254000	Yeah.
3254000	3255000	Like, for myself...
3255000	3256000	That's not...
3256000	3257000	You don't need...
3257000	3258000	I mean, no one needs to applaud anything.
3258000	3259000	No.
3259000	3260000	It's just a thing.
3260000	3262000	This is the fucking hardest conversation I've ever had.
3262000	3263000	This is great.
3263000	3264000	Good.
3264000	3265000	No, I know.
3265000	3266000	I love it.
3266000	3267000	I love it.
3267000	3270000	By the way, can I say one thing I saw breaking back tonight
3270000	3273000	and you guys all fucked up coming here?
3273000	3274000	It's great.
3274000	3275000	Go ahead.
3276000	3277000	When...
3277000	3280000	When a lot of people know about the Kinsey Scale, obviously,
3280000	3281000	but there's also...
3281000	3285000	I forget what it's called, but there's also another scale of sexuality.
3285000	3286000	The Kinsey Scale?
3286000	3287000	Thank you very much.
3287000	3288000	Kinsey Scale, yeah.
3288000	3289000	Good night.
3289000	3290000	Professional comedian.
3290000	3291000	Thank you very much.
3291000	3292000	He'll be here all week.
3292000	3296000	But it takes into account there's like seven or eight or 16...
3296000	3300000	There's a whole bunch of categories, but one of the main ones is fantasy.
3300000	3307000	And you're allowed to have fantasies that you don't actually want to act on.
3307000	3308000	And I think that's...
3308000	3309000	That's interesting.
3309000	3315000	That's where a lot of not only homophobia, but discrimination about sex comes from is
3315000	3317000	the shame from having a fantasy.
3317000	3323000	And if I can get really real right now and open up a little bit, but I personally, I'm
3323000	3326000	like a queer feminist, but I am like really...
3326000	3331000	Like I look at like hardcore, like violent porn on the internet.
3331000	3335000	And like it's not something that I would ever want to do myself.
3335000	3336000	Violent how?
3336000	3339000	You know, like describe it real slow.
3342000	3345000	While I jerk off behind the controller podium.
3345000	3347000	Well, listen, but in that...
3347000	3348000	This is why...
3348000	3350000	By the way, that's why I have the podium, you guys.
3351000	3354000	I almost always got my dick in my hand out there.
3354000	3356000	And it's also wearing a suit.
3356000	3357000	Go ahead.
3358000	3366000	No, I mean, just, you know, like S&M stuff that I don't have any interest in, but that is...
3366000	3368000	You have some interest in, you don't have interest in...
3368000	3373000	Interest in doing it physically with my body, but my brain obviously is stimulated.
3373000	3376000	Well, there's a huge factor there too.
3376000	3378000	We walk around with clothes on.
3379000	3381000	Like I said, we have to...
3381000	3387000	Like 90% of our conscious lives, like we are in disguise.
3387000	3389000	We are...
3389000	3392000	Our sexuality is...
3392000	3394000	And we're happy about it.
3394000	3396000	Otherwise it wouldn't exist.
3396000	3399000	We've certainly, we've revolted for less.
3399000	3407000	If the plebeians didn't want cardigans and underwear and shoes and things, like they wouldn't exist.
3407000	3415000	We're all pretty stoked about a certain fundamental wall between who we are as animals with our engorged privates
3415000	3419000	and who we are walking around between orgasms.
3419000	3421000	Well, the hardest thing has been...
3421000	3433000	But so because there's that fundamental wall, like there is that other factor where people like things that are wrong.
3433000	3436000	Like that is a huge turn on.
3436000	3437000	It's like a battery.
3437000	3440000	Like there is what's right and there is what's wrong.
3440000	3443000	Yeah, like talking in an alley is awesome because of that.
3443000	3444000	The public sex.
3444000	3446000	Yeah, you go get on...
3446000	3450000	Yeah, the abuse in the bedroom between two consensual adults.
3450000	3455000	Like, I mean, like you said that, you know, like people shitting on each other was wrong, but the thing is, is like...
3455000	3458000	But he didn't. He didn't say it's wrong.
3458000	3464000	I'm still mad about the night that we started talking about pooping on each other and people were too quick to...
3464000	3465000	I think it's great.
3465000	3466000	But I mean...
3466000	3469000	No, if it's your thing, poop on each other.
3469000	3472000	And if you both agree to it, like, what's... there's nothing wrong with that.
3472000	3474000	Yeah, if you found someone who was into that...
3474000	3475000	I mean, I don't want to wash the sheets when you're done.
3475000	3477000	Let's not poop on each other, everybody.
3477000	3479000	No, no, no, but if you want to...
3479000	3484000	No, I mean, look, if you like poop, then fine, but let's... seriously.
3484000	3486000	Fucking back to the drawing board.
3486000	3490000	At least, hey, come on. I mean, I'm sticking to this. That's terrible. Why would you say that?
3490000	3493000	I'm just saying because I don't like the smell of poofies.
3493000	3497000	But you're not there since you're trying to start a couple in Santa Monica.
3497000	3501000	Someone's listening right now going, I was on the fence about pooping on people.
3501000	3502000	You know what?
3502000	3503000	The poopy side.
3503000	3504000	I'm not pushing you.
3504000	3509000	If someone's on the fence about pooping, poopy sex, they're not on the fence about poopy sex.
3509000	3511000	Exactly, and they need to be pushed.
3511000	3513000	People like you, Jeff.
3513000	3517000	If you're listening to me out there tonight, if you're listening to me,
3517000	3522000	if you're listening as a couple and both of you look at each other right now,
3522000	3526000	because I said there's such a thing as being on the fence about poopy sex,
3526000	3529000	Dan Harmon will come to your house and shout at you right now.
3529000	3534000	Go into your bathroom right now and start involving poop in your sex and see what happens.
3534000	3537000	Yeah, eat the fucking kale and have the night of your lives.
3537000	3540000	I'm really sorry I brought it up.
3540000	3544000	But I mean, like, what Lauren was saying is like, you know, with...
3544000	3545000	Are you Lauren?
3545000	3548000	Hi, nice to meet you.
3549000	3553000	But when she's talking about fantasy and making it real,
3553000	3557000	some people have rape fantasies.
3557000	3559000	They have fantasies of being raped.
3559000	3562000	But the thing is that there's a difference between having a rape fantasy
3562000	3569000	and having somebody that can enact that with you that says yes and being raped.
3569000	3573000	It's all about safe, sane, consensual, that everybody is on the same page
3573000	3575000	and everybody knows what's going on.
3575000	3580000	And, you know, you look at, like, Jeffrey Dahmer, like, he got off on dead men.
3580000	3584000	And, you know, we drew the line because he was killing people.
3584000	3587000	Yeah, if he's maybe just broken into a cemetery, you'd be like,
3587000	3589000	all right, I kind of see your point.
3589000	3594000	What he was trying to do was actually he was trying to reanimate,
3594000	3596000	like, dead bodies at a certain point,
3596000	3598000	to the point where they were had slight function.
3598000	3599000	Really? With his penis?
3599000	3600000	Yeah.
3600000	3601000	No, not with his penis.
3601000	3604000	He was actually, like, drilling holes in their heads and doing all sorts of crazy shit.
3604000	3605000	Well, that's why he was doing that.
3605000	3609000	As a Milakian who was living a couple doors down from that going on.
3609000	3610000	Yeah.
3610000	3611000	Yeah.
3611000	3612000	Oh, wait.
3612000	3614000	All the laws in the world didn't stop it from happening.
3614000	3616000	So it's like as soon as it was, you know,
3616000	3620000	he would actually, like, kidnap these men and then murder them to have sex with them.
3620000	3621000	That's the line.
3621000	3624000	That's the line is because these men aren't signing up to be murdered.
3624000	3627000	Like, that's the line. That's the line. We've defined it.
3627000	3629000	We figured it out.
3629000	3631000	Thank you, Kelly. Kelly, everyone.
3631000	3633000	Isn't that a show you're on?
3633000	3635000	That's the line, isn't it, anyway?
3637000	3638000	Oh, yeah.
3638000	3641000	There is no line. There is a beach.
3641000	3643000	It is a surf.
3643000	3648000	Like, that is the thing that we have to get comfortable with.
3648000	3655000	There's no wall you can build.
3655000	3662000	Like, what legislation would you have adopted to prevent Jeffrey Dahmer from eating 17?
3662000	3664000	Don't kidnap people and murder them.
3664000	3666000	Those laws have already been in existence.
3666000	3668000	Yeah, but he's outside the law.
3668000	3671000	Just because he was able to get through it doesn't mean we fucked up.
3671000	3681000	So we keep trying to make sure that there's this wall ideologically where anybody that does anything that's reprehensible to us socially exists outside the wall.
3681000	3689000	We keep trying to make sure that our laws say that if you're doing something questionable, you're on the other side of the wall.
3690000	3693000	I mean, that's a ridiculous attempt.
3693000	3695000	Then what do you propose?
3695000	3698000	Oh! Oh, shit!
3698000	3701000	I propose we stop proposing.
3701000	3703000	Well, that's not solving any problems.
3703000	3705000	I didn't come here to solve any problems.
3705000	3707000	You're just shitting on people.
3707000	3709000	I love shitting on people. It makes me cum.
3709000	3711000	I knew it! I knew it!
3711000	3714000	I want permission to shit on everybody.
3714000	3715000	Yeah, it's good.
3715000	3720000	See, that's the fucking... God damn it, Spencer.
3720000	3723000	I don't propose anything.
3723000	3726000	That doesn't mean I can't say something.
3726000	3733000	The walls are there, kicking them is healthy, pushing them down is healthy, punching holes in them is healthy.
3733000	3735000	It depends on the walls if you're punching and kicking.
3735000	3738000	Yeah, you're talking about walls that imprison people for raping kids.
3738000	3742000	Yeah, the wall that's leaving out pedophiles is a good wall.
3742000	3743000	Don't kick that shit.
3743000	3744000	It's not the walls.
3744000	3745000	Don't kick those walls.
3745000	3748000	But, you know, there was a time where homosexuality, there was a wall between that.
3748000	3750000	That was a good wall to kick down.
3750000	3751000	Kick down that wall.
3751000	3754000	Black people, white people, marrying, that's a good wall to kick down.
3754000	3757000	Pedophilia, that's not a good wall to kick down.
3757000	3759000	All right, we figured it out then.
3759000	3765000	Everybody here is existing comfortably within walls where we get to run everywhere we want to run.
3765000	3768000	Nobody feels inappropriately limited in any way.
3768000	3772000	I think it goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning with humanism
3772000	3776000	and maybe we should just pay more attention to each other.
3776000	3780000	Maybe this wall-building system, maybe this idea that walls are a thing,
3780000	3783000	maybe that's the problem?
3783000	3785000	What about the murder wall?
3785000	3788000	If you think it's such a bad idea, I'll kill you all right now.
3788000	3790000	Are you going to kill us?
3790000	3793000	Are you going to kill me if I lower that wall?
3793000	3794000	You're not going to kill us.
3794000	3795000	There's no police here.
3795000	3797000	There's nothing to prevent you from killing me.
3797000	3799000	Yeah, but he won't, but somebody else will.
3799000	3800000	No one will.
3800000	3801000	No one will kill me.
3801000	3804000	Anyone that wants to kill me, come up and kill me.
3804000	3805000	No, that's the wall.
3805000	3807000	Anyone, come up and kill me.
3807000	3809000	I give you permission to come kill me.
3809000	3810000	There's no wall.
3810000	3814000	There's no wall preventing you from killing me.
3814000	3815000	There is.
3815000	3818000	If you say come kill me and he comes kill you, that guy is fucked forever.
3818000	3821000	You think that's why he's not killing me?
3821000	3824000	No, but there is someone that would kill you.
3824000	3827000	That's why you're not killing me because you don't want to go to jail?
3827000	3828000	No.
3828000	3831000	No, but there is someone who's not killing you for that reason.
3831000	3832000	It's not this guy.
3832000	3834000	But there's someone who's not fucking kids for that reason.
3834000	3837000	Like otherwise they would and it's not anyone here.
3837000	3840000	We are building walls too closely to where we live.
3840000	3841000	What about the wall?
3841000	3843000	To keep people that we think are out there.
3843000	3844000	What about the wall in Game of Thrones?
3844000	3845000	We need that one, right?
3845000	3847000	Yeah, get some crowds.
3847000	3849000	That one is absolutely necessary.
3849000	3850000	We need that one.
3850000	3851000	No, actually, no.
3851000	3852000	God damn it, no.
3852000	3853000	See, I got you.
3853000	3856000	The whole point of Game of Thrones is you find out that the walls shouldn't be there.
3856000	3857000	No, it means the wall shouldn't be there.
3857000	3859000	The wildlings end up helping everybody.
3859000	3860000	Get the taller wall.
3860000	3863000	The wall keeps out the dead ice zombies, man.
3863000	3864000	The ice zombies, yeah.
3864000	3867000	The ice zombies are fucking kids, dude.
3867000	3871000	The ice zombies are exact.
3871000	3878000	Can we talk about the morality of having me come up on stage to eject someone else from the stage?
3878000	3880000	That was just defense.
3880000	3883000	That felt really, I felt really used at that time.
3883000	3884000	That's it.
3884000	3885000	I felt it.
3885000	3890000	I felt that there's a line between, like, we thought that he was being ejected from the stage,
3890000	3893000	and he went over and took your seat, which I thought is a seat of honor.
3893000	3896000	I think of that seat as being your throne over there.
3896000	3898000	Yeah, that's not some...
3898000	3899000	I just felt used.
3899000	3903000	I wouldn't sit in your seat, because I would feel like I was usurping a throne.
3903000	3906000	I'd sit in your seat.
3906000	3908000	I'll shit all over you, man.
3908000	3910000	Let's all thank Lauren for coming up.
3910000	3911000	Thank you, Lauren.
3911000	3912000	Thank you, Lauren.
3915000	3920000	I mean, look, somebody walks into the middle of a field and starts asking the question,
3920000	3923000	why do we hate pedophiles?
3923000	3928000	And 48 minutes later, like, we're yelling at each other.
3928000	3929000	I'm saying...
3929000	3931000	It's a great episode.
3931000	3934000	What do you mean by that?
3934000	3936000	I'm saying, I think that our whole...
3936000	3940000	Like, we need to evolve as people beyond a certain point.
3941000	3946000	That system of thinking, when someone challenges you, when someone comes up to you and says,
3946000	3954000	hey, you brought up the fact that black people who had this culture going on,
3954000	3958000	all of a sudden, this shit started rolling downhill.
3958000	3961000	You know, this system of walls was a big part of that.
3961000	3962000	No, but...
3962000	3966000	There was a huge Muslim rap movement going on before 9-11,
3966000	3970000	and then those bow ties went into the drawers really fast.
3970000	3974000	Like, 9-11 happened, and then it was like, zip mums the word.
3974000	3980000	Sure, but I mean, I think for society to exist and to have people who are,
3980000	3986000	who have bad brains from ruining society, we have to have these walls.
3986000	3990000	I mean, what are you saying, that we just have no laws and we just walk around,
3990000	3993000	do whatever we want and hope that everyone makes the right decision?
3993000	3998000	But we don't have any walls between us and the kinds of people that build walls.
3998000	4001000	We have a new entry. What's your name?
4002000	4006000	Hello, Laura. Grab the mic over there. Fuck it. Let's do it.
4007000	4009000	This is the Lauren seat.
4009000	4012000	It's the Laura Lauren seat, yeah.
4012000	4013000	No, I was just going to talk about this.
4013000	4016000	We were talking about pedophiles and undesirals,
4016000	4020000	but we didn't really talk about better living through chemistry with chemical castration,
4020000	4024000	because it's like people agree that pedophiles should be put in prison and moderners.
4024000	4026000	And some of them beg to be castrated.
4026000	4028000	Some of them do, or chemically castor or castrate.
4028000	4032000	Do we believe in better living through chemistry with taking these people
4032000	4034000	and making them unable to do one race or pet sex?
4034000	4036000	We do it to our pets.
4036000	4040000	My girlfriend started crying the other night because Harvey's coming up on his day.
4040000	4044000	Yeah, it's tough. I've had a million pets castrated, Spade.
4044000	4046000	Your pets, they're just like pedophiles.
4046000	4048000	I mean, they are.
4048000	4049000	That's where the word comes from.
4049000	4051000	They are, in the sense that they are.
4051000	4054000	If you read any book about pet care, it says,
4054000	4057000	in case you're feeling bad about neutering your dog,
4057000	4060000	it puts you at ease and says, you know what?
4060000	4065000	I know that to human beings, this is a very valuable asset,
4065000	4070000	but to the animals that we've domesticated, it's a source of frustration,
4070000	4076000	and it presents them with urges that they cannot say shit, and it causes them pain.
4076000	4079000	And there's a reason for them. It's better for them.
4079000	4081000	If they could speak, they would thank you.
4081000	4083000	And I believe it, kind of.
4083000	4084000	I don't know about that.
4084000	4086000	But do you agree that that's a way to deal with pet?
4086000	4088000	Is that more humane to deal with pedophiles than just put them in jail?
4088000	4091000	Do we agree that as a society, as an adult in America,
4091000	4094000	that if you have certain desirable urges that we don't like,
4094000	4097000	then we can just mangle your junk or we can, like, cut it up?
4097000	4101000	I don't know, but I do think it's weird that we consider it more sacred
4101000	4104000	what goes on up in this bowl of pudding at the top of your neck
4104000	4108000	than we do with this mess between your legs.
4108000	4110000	And I don't know what the research is saying.
4110000	4113000	Can we call it a chocolate mousse in our legs?
4113000	4118000	If you castrate a pedophile, do they just...
4118000	4121000	You call your dick your chocolate mousse?
4121000	4125000	Well, weirdly, this is so much TMI.
4125000	4128000	My dick is maybe five shades darker than the rest of me,
4128000	4131000	so I do call it my chocolate mousse.
4131000	4134000	Where's that clapping coming from?
4134000	4137000	That's my wife clapping back there.
4137000	4139000	That's not Dustin?
4139000	4140000	No, it's my wife.
4140000	4141000	Oh, it's not Dustin.
4141000	4143000	She knows. Dustin doesn't know.
4143000	4145000	I don't know.
4145000	4148000	But a lot of states in the South during the 50s and 60s,
4148000	4153000	they find records that they sterilized people that they thought were poor.
4153000	4155000	People would go to prison and they would get paralyzed.
4155000	4157000	Well, that's bad. There's been movements about that, too.
4157000	4160000	If you're poor and you're having a kid, like,
4160000	4163000	oh, this is just going to be a welfare baby.
4163000	4165000	There's been Joan of Arc's in that movement
4165000	4168000	who have been alternatively celebrated and burned to the stake.
4168000	4171000	I predict there's going to be no Joan of Arc in the pedophilia movement.
4171000	4174000	I don't think there's going to be someone who will be like,
4174000	4176000	oh, it turns out they were right.
4176000	4178000	Okay, so let's move forward from that.
4178000	4181000	So let's say, let's castrate them.
4181000	4182000	So when you are found...
4182000	4184000	I'm not saying that. That, for me, is a weird line.
4184000	4185000	All right.
4185000	4187000	But you want to solve a problem, don't you?
4187000	4189000	Yeah, put them away.
4189000	4190000	Put them away.
4190000	4191000	How is that better?
4191000	4193000	Is it better to have them getting hard in jail thinking about kids
4193000	4196000	or to just be out in the world not thinking about kids
4196000	4197000	doing their job?
4197000	4201000	Well, if they want it, but for me, it's me doing something to their body,
4201000	4202000	specifically...
4202000	4204000	Against their will.
4204000	4205000	Yeah, against their will.
4205000	4207000	They're putting their body in a cell against their will.
4207000	4209000	Yeah, because they're fucking kids, dude.
4209000	4210000	Yeah.
4210000	4212000	For me, that's the problem...
4212000	4213000	You know what the rules are.
4213000	4215000	But how long are you going to put them away for?
4215000	4217000	The problem with criminal justice is that we punish people,
4217000	4221000	but we don't give any money or any energy to actual rehabilitation.
4221000	4222000	Yeah, why not kill them?
4222000	4223000	Why not give you the gun?
4223000	4225000	Let you put a bullet in the back of their head.
4225000	4227000	We throw people and lock them up for all these different crimes,
4227000	4231000	for drug possession and for rape and for all these disparate crimes,
4231000	4232000	stuff like that.
4232000	4234000	But we don't have the time or the will because, again,
4234000	4236000	it's not the reciprocity thing.
4236000	4239000	There's no profit making a bad person into a good person.
4239000	4241000	Yeah, and the thing is, in a lot of cases...
4241000	4243000	There's no profit in the prison system.
4243000	4244000	There is no profit in the prison system.
4244000	4245000	In some cases...
4245000	4246000	Well, there is.
4246000	4249000	In some cases, you're going to deal, and I think in minimal cases,
4249000	4251000	you're going to deal with people that are unfixable
4251000	4255000	because of the glob of toothpaste inside their cranium.
4255000	4258000	There's just wiring that goes wrong,
4258000	4260000	and there's bad things that happen to the human brain,
4260000	4261000	and it's complex as shit.
4261000	4264000	We should deal with every problem,
4264000	4266000	the pothole in the street in front of our house,
4266000	4270000	to somebody being sick and having a runny nose, to everything.
4270000	4273000	We should deal with it as communities, with compassion,
4273000	4276000	as opposed to throwing it away to these...
4276000	4280000	Just giving it to the government, to things.
4280000	4281000	It's like, draw lines.
4281000	4283000	Draw big, hard lines in the sand,
4283000	4285000	and so we can just push things over these walls
4285000	4287000	and forget about them.
4287000	4289000	The hardest thing in the world to do would be
4289000	4290000	to actually care for each other,
4290000	4292000	to actually be responsible for ourselves,
4292000	4294000	for our parents, for our kids,
4294000	4297000	and not just throw them into the street.
4297000	4300000	We don't have any responsibility for our lives.
4300000	4301000	And if your neighbor is a pedophile,
4302000	4303000	you should be going down to their house,
4303000	4306000	and actually, you should castrate them.
4306000	4307000	You should be the one to castrate them.
4307000	4308000	One on one.
4308000	4309000	Cut it off.
4309000	4310000	Bring them a nice pie.
4310000	4312000	It's like filling a pothole.
4314000	4316000	With broken dicks.
4317000	4319000	We should fill potholes with broken dicks.
4319000	4322000	I'm not saying that we should go cut their penises off,
4322000	4325000	but I am saying we should separate them from situations
4325000	4326000	where they can fuck children.
4326000	4327000	I feel like that's a very...
4327000	4328000	No, I actually...
4328000	4330000	Same thing for me to advocate for.
4330000	4335000	I'm saying, if the proposal is that there be proposals,
4335000	4338000	if the idea is that there needs to be solutions,
4338000	4341000	then the problem is that there is...
4341000	4342000	There do need to be solutions, yes.
4342000	4345000	I don't think that putting someone in a four-foot cell...
4345000	4346000	Of course not.
4346000	4348000	It stops them from fucking children.
4348000	4350000	They don't stay in there, though.
4350000	4351000	No, but when they come...
4351000	4354000	Why would you keep someone in there until they die?
4354000	4355000	Then just kill them,
4355000	4358000	or acknowledge that you are determining
4358000	4360000	that their sexuality is...
4360000	4361000	And castrate them.
4361000	4362000	A lot of them...
4362000	4363000	Community is like...
4363000	4365000	They ask for it great.
4365000	4366000	Whatever they want.
4366000	4368000	So we wait for them to ask for it,
4368000	4370000	and until they do, we put them in a cell,
4370000	4372000	and we keep asking them.
4372000	4374000	We hold up a picture of a child, and we go,
4374000	4375000	do you have a boner?
4375000	4378000	And if they say yes, then we leave them in there.
4378000	4381000	Or if you have a boner,
4381000	4383000	promise you won't do anything when you get out,
4383000	4386000	and if you can believe that, then let them out.
4387000	4389000	But if there's someone...
4389000	4390000	This is...
4390000	4393000	If someone you think is going to rape children
4393000	4394000	when you put them out there,
4394000	4397000	walls are a very good thing to have.
4397000	4399000	Putting them away from situations
4399000	4401000	where they will go fuck children.
4401000	4402000	I just don't know if the walls are built...
4402000	4404000	I mean, I think walls are fantastic.
4404000	4406000	I have four of them of my own
4406000	4408000	that cheap out people that I don't like.
4408000	4410000	But a lot of those people are people that build walls.
4410000	4413000	You're never going to build a wall that keeps murder from happening,
4413000	4414000	or keeps rape from happening.
4414000	4416000	But we can keep trying, right?
4416000	4419000	Isn't it the point to not have murders or rapes happen?
4419000	4421000	That's what we're trying to do.
4421000	4425000	I think, though, that there's a way to deal with problems like this
4425000	4428000	with criminality and with anti-social behavior,
4428000	4431000	is to look at the actual...
4431000	4433000	Look at the humanity behind what's going on.
4433000	4435000	Sure, just because I understand...
4435000	4438000	Just because I see that a pedophile wants to fuck kids
4438000	4441000	doesn't mean he's any less of a criminal.
4442000	4444000	I think it should be dealt with...
4444000	4445000	I mean, I think everything should be dealt with
4445000	4447000	within the actual communities themselves.
4447000	4450000	There was a story of a rapist that got paroled and let out.
4450000	4453000	And the community took it upon themselves.
4453000	4456000	This is before the laws that you had to go and form the town.
4456000	4459000	They put pictures of this guy everywhere.
4459000	4461000	And they said, if you see him,
4461000	4463000	do not lend him any services or any goods.
4463000	4464000	Yeah, but that's one...
4464000	4466000	And the guy basically was just outcast.
4466000	4468000	And he actually came back and said,
4468000	4471000	I'm sorry, I can't survive like this.
4471000	4474000	Yeah, but that's one society in Pakistan where I'm from.
4474000	4476000	All these villages have their own rules.
4476000	4478000	And if a woman marries the wrong person, they're like,
4478000	4480000	all right, let's just kill this guy.
4480000	4482000	In practice, those things don't work.
4482000	4484000	They just kill people.
4484000	4488000	You have to have these sort of rules that we've all agreed on.
4488000	4492000	That one situation, it works, but it doesn't work in Pakistan.
4492000	4494000	I think societies go through enlightenment
4494000	4495000	and they go through dark ages.
4495000	4498000	And I don't know if we're heading towards one or the other right now.
4498000	4501000	But there's times when I think we go through thresholds of enlightenment
4501000	4503000	where people actually step up and go,
4503000	4505000	okay, compassion is the new rule now.
4505000	4507000	Then we head towards really dark ages and things like that.
4507000	4509000	Yeah, I mean, are we going to...
4509000	4512000	Let's call it spade to spade.
4512000	4518000	Is America, despite our self-deprecation, self-loathing,
4518000	4522000	this acknowledgement of the fact that we're on the economic downslide
4522000	4524000	and that the empire has fallen,
4524000	4526000	are we top of the line or not?
4526000	4529000	Is it our responsibility to be the most socially progressive or not?
4529000	4530000	No, we aren't.
4530000	4533000	Okay, well, then let's settle back down into what works.
4533000	4535000	No, it is, but we aren't.
4535000	4536000	We aren't the most socially progressive.
4536000	4537000	Okay, yeah, it's great.
4537000	4539000	It's very fashionable to say that.
4539000	4540000	But we really aren't.
4540000	4542000	We really are not.
4542000	4545000	Then let's not make it our business to be so.
4545000	4548000	Let's pull back into what's functional.
4548000	4550000	That's what America does best.
4550000	4551000	Let's be isolationist.
4551000	4553000	What?
4553000	4556000	That's like saying, I'm not the skinniest guy,
4556000	4558000	so I'm never going to go on a diet.
4558000	4559000	That's crazy.
4559000	4561000	Sweden's super progressive,
4561000	4564000	but that doesn't mean we can't try to have better Wi-Fi.
4564000	4565000	That's right.
4565000	4569000	But if you're spending money on a gym membership that you never use,
4569000	4572000	can you instead say, I'll cancel that gym membership
4572000	4574000	and I'll just try to eat more fruits and vegetables.
4574000	4576000	I don't subscribe to that example.
4576000	4579000	But I'll do something.
4579000	4581000	You look at the more economically advantageous route
4581000	4585000	that you don't just keep throwing money at a thing that clearly is not working.
4585000	4587000	For us, we could say economically,
4587000	4590000	to keep putting money into therapy for pedophiles that doesn't work
4590000	4592000	and doesn't keep anyone from fucking kids,
4592000	4595000	we could instead say, let's try to get kids off drugs or whatever
4595000	4597000	and say, that's not working.
4597000	4599000	Let's just castrate them all or put them all in prison.
4599000	4602000	And what does Sweden do with their pedophiles?
4602000	4604000	Do they give them free Wi-Fi?
4604000	4608000	What does Sweden do with non-Swedish people?
4608000	4610000	Do they do anything with them?
4610000	4613000	Because European prisons that are actually designed for rehabilitation
4613000	4615000	and they give people a lot of freedom,
4615000	4618000	they put them on an island and say, oh, here, you could grow your own food.
4618000	4620000	Here's a little farm.
4620000	4622000	That's what I want.
4622000	4624000	Our prison system needs to be an island
4624000	4629000	where capitalism is an option but not required.
4629000	4632000	Australia.
4632000	4634000	Alcatraz.
4634000	4636000	That's called a prison.
4636000	4640000	The big problem with prison is that the big joke is like, you're not.
4640000	4641000	That's just punishment.
4641000	4643000	Well, the joke is the profit because in America,
4643000	4645000	you make money by having prison.
4645000	4649000	Like you have prisoners and the government gives you the person money.
4649000	4651000	Yeah, you have this free labor force and it's insane.
4651000	4653000	And you're incentivized to incarcerate them.
4653000	4654000	No one's getting rehabilitated.
4654000	4655000	You're only getting to be a better criminal.
4655000	4656000	I'm for rehab prison.
4656000	4657000	I'm totally for that.
4657000	4659000	I think, you know, I'm not saying nobody else is.
4659000	4662000	Okay, so let's rehab a pedophile in prison.
4662000	4663000	Can you?
4663000	4665000	No, you can't.
4665000	4666000	You can rehab some pedophiles.
4666000	4668000	Well then, what do you want us to do with them?
4668000	4671000	I want to stop proposing things that have anything to do with the system.
4671000	4672000	You just want to hold on progress.
4672000	4675000	By the way, the reason why I brought this subject up
4675000	4678000	is not because I love pedophilia.
4678000	4679000	No, I understand.
4679000	4680000	I understand that.
4680000	4683000	It's because I think that our system,
4683000	4686000	like you can go to the dark corners and realize
4686000	4690000	that we are not equipped for the fucking hellfire that's to come.
4690000	4693000	Like we are, every fucking day,
4693000	4696000	we are moving further and further into this surf
4696000	4698000	where the walls aren't going to work anymore.
4698000	4700000	They're not going to work.
4700000	4704000	The Canadians are able to argue that my show is a bad show.
4704000	4706000	They don't matter in the Neilsons.
4706000	4709000	That's the first sign of the apocalypse
4709000	4712000	that I have to talk to a Canadian on Reddit and go,
4712000	4717000	well, if you think about it, maybe community was funny last night.
4717000	4720000	It's only going to get worse.
4720000	4721000	It's only going to get worse.
4721000	4723000	I can't tell sometimes, Dan.
4723000	4724000	I'm not trying to be provocative.
4724000	4726000	I can't tell right now, honestly,
4726000	4729000	whether you're on the side of walls or not.
4729000	4730000	He's against walls.
4730000	4732000	I know that you're against walls,
4732000	4734000	but you do live within a certain source.
4734000	4739000	I'm on the side of an audit into the masonry division.
4739000	4742000	I would like to know what goes into the construction of walls
4742000	4744000	and who's walling in the wall makers.
4744000	4747000	We necessitate walls because we don't want any personal responsibility
4747000	4748000	for anything we do.
4748000	4751000	We give it to other people to build walls around our cities,
4751000	4752000	around our ideas.
4752000	4755000	But you don't want some of these people out there deciding they don't want morality.
4755000	4758000	You don't want these people out there deciding what's right or wrong, right?
4758000	4759000	No.
4759000	4761000	You don't want like a crazy person being like,
4761000	4764000	in my head, it makes sense to fuck kids and then kill this guy.
4764000	4768000	It doesn't make sense for that to be, you have to have these walls.
4768000	4769000	I agree.
4769000	4771000	I would like to know, for instance,
4771000	4774000	why I can't have this conversation without all of us
4774000	4776000	trying to build walls around each other
4776000	4779000	and figure out where the right and wrong place to put bricks is.
4779000	4783000	I would like to know why this conversation can't happen
4783000	4788000	without everyone starting to assert the right and wrong of it.
4788000	4790000	You and I both agree, because we're talking about this a lot,
4790000	4794000	that the ideal society would be one that was a fluid conversation
4794000	4798000	between communities, between people, and no hierarchy,
4798000	4800000	just based on an exchange of ideas.
4800000	4804000	And that would be women and men and queers and everybody doing cool shit.
4804000	4805000	And that would be great.
4805000	4807000	But the problem is, the education isn't there.
4807000	4810000	You have to go through decades and generations of education
4810000	4812000	to get people to have a fucking...
4812000	4814000	Kids in a sandlot aren't racist.
4814000	4816000	They're not fucking... They're not gross.
4816000	4817000	They're not...
4817000	4822000	Problems get dealt with really kind of quickly and very organically.
4822000	4826000	For adults to do that now, you'd have to go through decades of education.
4826000	4828000	Well, that's why we're leaving, for sure.
4828000	4831000	You don't make seven billion people start doing something different.
4831000	4832000	You can't now.
4833000	4835000	The bummer...
4835000	4836000	She's slipping away.
4836000	4838000	We've actually just traded more.
4838000	4839000	She has to be...
4839000	4841000	Let me finish my thought.
4841000	4845000	The idea now, the bummer is I'm going to turn 30 and 40 in a week.
4845000	4847000	Geez, I'm trying. I tried.
4847000	4849000	That's hard living, man.
4849000	4851000	I'm turning 40 in a week.
4851000	4853000	You lose a little bit of your idealism,
4853000	4857000	and the sad thing is that the idea that what I thought was possible
4857000	4859000	when I was 19 and reading all this stuff
4859000	4862000	and thinking the idea that it's possible to live communally,
4862000	4867000	it's possible to have liberty and actually live for the people around you,
4867000	4870000	actually be the good version of socialists
4870000	4875000	and the good version of libertarian and be a free society.
4875000	4876000	You think, oh, it's happened.
4876000	4880000	We were close a few times throughout the last few hundred years.
4880000	4883000	As you get older, which is a bummer,
4883000	4885000	and I'm not trying to talk people into this,
4885000	4888000	I hate the fact that I don't think you can fucking do it anymore.
4888000	4891000	I don't think that we are evolved enough...
4891000	4892000	Oh, no, be certain.
4892000	4893000	The only one that's ever...
4893000	4896000	As technology comes in, as we allow this technology in our phones,
4896000	4900000	and we sacrifice liberty so willfully, because it's great.
4900000	4903000	It's so fucking awesome to just touch a phone
4903000	4904000	and you have access to everything,
4904000	4908000	and you don't have to learn or gain any knowledge.
4908000	4911000	You don't have to go through anything to learn anything.
4911000	4913000	You mean as you get closer to the dirt?
4913000	4917000	You mean as you get closer to the grave than you are from the vagina?
4917000	4921000	That's why 20-year-olds are co-opted into these educational labyrinths
4921000	4922000	and into the military.
4922000	4925000	That's why they are told to direct their passion,
4925000	4929000	which is inherent to them, into fighting for the tribe
4929000	4931000	instead of fighting against it.
4931000	4932000	They threaten us.
4932000	4935000	We use them to kill each other when we go to war.
4935000	4937000	We use them.
4937000	4939000	We fear them.
4939000	4942000	We give birth to them, and when they are teenagers,
4942000	4947000	a 17-year-old person is so filled with so much energy
4947000	4950000	and so unafraid of death because they don't realize it's an inevitability
4950000	4953000	that they actually have a capacity for idealism.
4953000	4957000	They have the capacity for change, and we use them to build walls.
4957000	4960000	We use them to move cargo containers, and we tell them,
4960000	4961000	go off.
4961000	4963000	Hey, Iraq, you should go fight them.
4963000	4966000	We tell them that they're full of shit,
4966000	4969000	and we live in fear of them as we creep into the grave.
4969000	4971000	I absolutely agree with you at 40 years old.
4971000	4974000	I'm so glad I have toilet paper that's three-ply instead of two-ply.
4974000	4977000	I can't believe I ever lived through two-ply.
4977000	4979000	I can't believe I ever had to change my own light bulb.
4979000	4981000	I can't believe I didn't know what dark chocolate was
4981000	4983000	and how much better it was than milk chocolate.
4983000	4986000	I can't believe Breaking Bad was so good this season.
4986000	4990000	I'm so happy that I'm not going to get hurt before I die.
4990000	4994000	I hope to God they stick a tube down my throat and they just take me out.
4994000	4997000	But revolution doesn't come in a voting booth.
4998000	5002000	It doesn't happen within the worlds that we create for these kids.
5002000	5007000	We build walls around them, and we tell them the difference between left and right.
5007000	5010000	We tell them that if your belly button is pierced, you're liberal.
5010000	5014000	And we tell them that if you have a flag in your window, you're conservative.
5014000	5019000	And it's all horseshit because there's worlds beyond those fucking walls.
5019000	5022000	And yes, if you break down those walls,
5022000	5026000	you might end up knowing a pedophile and actually forgiving them.
5026000	5028000	Maybe that was my point the whole time,
5028000	5032000	that we build these fucking walls that are so convenient for us
5032000	5034000	because there's people standing on them that say,
5034000	5039000	if you go beyond this point, you forgive the idea of fucking a three-year-old.
5039000	5042000	There's other things back there.
5042000	5045000	There's hidden packages. There's bonus levels.
5045000	5049000	There's shit outside the rectangle that we create around ourselves.
5049000	5052000	We employ these people, like you said.
5052000	5054000	We wake up in the morning and we go,
5054000	5056000	oh, man, I hope the cop keeps me safe.
5056000	5058000	I don't want a dude crawling in my window.
5058000	5061000	I got a girlfriend in here. I got a Breaking Bad party tonight.
5061000	5064000	I don't want some dudes coming in and deciding to break bad.
5064000	5066000	And those cops out there are going,
5066000	5069000	man, I'll protect that house. Fucking A, man.
5069000	5071000	I don't want some dude crawling in there.
5071000	5073000	I got my salary. I want to make lieutenant.
5073000	5075000	I want to do whatever the hell motivates them.
5075000	5079000	I only learned about police from Breaking Bad.
5079000	5084000	It all goes down, but it's working.
5084000	5087000	It's working fantastic. It's working great.
5087000	5090000	It works so well. Life is so safe and so easy.
5090000	5095000	Even if you have a kind of bad, even if you're broke
5095000	5099000	and you're indigent and you have no direction,
5099000	5101000	life is so comfortable and so safe.
5101000	5103000	In certain countries, not in all of them.
5103000	5106000	Just here. Or like ten countries.
5107000	5109000	Every time I fucking turn the television on,
5109000	5112000	there's some guy that's shot up a fucking supermarket or a school.
5112000	5115000	Or like a school of sleeping children. That happened today.
5115000	5118000	And never today.
5118000	5122000	It happened today in Nigeria.
5122000	5125000	And there's a wall that says you shouldn't do that.
5125000	5127000	And that's a good wall.
5127000	5130000	Absolutely. But now life is so simple.
5130000	5133000	I think people have always had neuroses
5133000	5137000	and people have always been freaky and sad.
5137000	5139000	Now there's more of us, first of all.
5139000	5141000	Second of all, we know everything that happens
5141000	5143000	because there's cameras everywhere, so we see it all happen
5143000	5145000	and we can all watch it happen.
5145000	5147000	We're interconnected with each other, that we're all more aware of it.
5147000	5149000	Now people talk about things more.
5149000	5152000	Rape is more talked about because people come forward more about it now.
5152000	5155000	It's always been happening, but now it's a lot.
5155000	5158000	NFL players have always been doing drugs and always been assholes.
5158000	5161000	Now they're always on TV more because we care about it more.
5161000	5163000	That's our big fucking fetish now.
5163000	5167000	Life is so fucking easy that revolution now is people going,
5167000	5169000	I don't like my life. I'm going to go out on TV.
5169000	5173000	I'm going to go out with my name on CNN for 38 hours
5173000	5176000	of a guy that did this fucking horrible atrocity.
5176000	5178000	We can't build walls.
5178000	5181000	There's no such thing as a wall that will keep that out.
5181000	5184000	There never has been a wall that keeps that guy out.
5184000	5187000	But that doesn't mean we don't build it.
5187000	5189000	I think the wall is a bad metaphor.
5189000	5190000	There's no physical thing.
5190000	5191000	The wall is a bad metaphor.
5191000	5194000	There isn't a wall. There's simple rights and wrongs
5194000	5197000	and we all have to agree on them and disagree on them all the time.
5197000	5199000	And I think we do agree on them.
5199000	5202000	I think the first thing you have to do is address the fact that, like you say,
5202000	5205000	there is a mysterious... I've talked to a great...
5205000	5207000	I think we all agree the wall is a bad metaphor
5207000	5210000	because there's no such thing as a physical wall
5210000	5212000	that has ever kept any of the shit from happening.
5212000	5214000	And there never will be.
5214000	5217000	But I think we think in our heads that if we build enough walls
5217000	5220000	in the right places that it will stop happening.
5220000	5222000	The wall is a bad metaphor.
5222000	5226000	There is no such thing as a wall that will stop any of it from happening.
5226000	5230000	No wall stopped Jeffrey Dahmer from scooping a dead squirrel out from his crawlspace
5230000	5232000	and going, run. That's interesting.
5232000	5235000	I think I'll make 17 people be my human zombies.
5235000	5238000	There was no wall that kept him from doing that.
5238000	5241000	Yeah, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.
5241000	5243000	The wall is a bad paradigm.
5243000	5246000	Okay, so the wall is the difference between right and wrong, right?
5246000	5248000	It's the difference between right and wrong.
5248000	5249000	That's what we're talking about.
5249000	5250000	Boundaries.
5250000	5251000	We're not talking about the wall.
5251000	5252000	It's what's right and wrong.
5252000	5256000	By the way, who's changing your light bulbs for you?
5257000	5261000	I wish Erin was here right now because she just literally got electrocuted yesterday.
5261000	5262000	Let's bring her up.
5262000	5263000	Oh, so it's Erin?
5263000	5264000	She's not here.
5264000	5265000	Oh, she's not here.
5265000	5267000	Erin? Erin is the one changing your light bulbs for you?
5267000	5269000	Well, the short answer is yes.
5269000	5272000	The medium answer is she got electrocuted doing it.
5272000	5275000	The long answer is, I mean, okay.
5275000	5276000	Is she all right?
5276000	5277000	She's fine.
5277000	5280000	She, there was a, she was changing a light bulb.
5280000	5282000	Yeah, zapped through her.
5282000	5285000	Well, since we bring her up, it's 937.
5285000	5288000	Let's move on to D&D.
5293000	5296000	Well, I said at the top of this, we were not going to settle anything.
5296000	5298000	I only wanted to discuss.
5298000	5299000	Jesus Christ.
5299000	5301000	Hey, we're starting D&D.
5302000	5303000	Yeah.
5304000	5306000	Hey, there's a wall right here.
5306000	5310000	I think, I think Adam's proven there's no walls in the show.
5311000	5313000	Okay, let's play D&D.
5313000	5316000	Dan, I will leave it to you to decide who plays Mulrain.
5316000	5318000	All right, let Adam play Mulrain.
5318000	5319000	Can we get a woman up?
5319000	5320000	Emily?
5320000	5321000	Do you want to play?
5321000	5322000	Emily!
5323000	5324000	Sorry, Adam.
5324000	5325000	That's good.
5325000	5326000	I love you dearly.
5326000	5327000	Emily's a therapist.
5327000	5330000	She's got, this is a good Erin replacement.
5332000	5333000	Hello, Emily.
5333000	5334000	Hi, how's it going, you guys?
5334000	5335000	Very well.
5335000	5337000	I spent many years working with the kinds of people you're talking about.
5337000	5341000	Yeah, actually, let's, even if it eclipses D&D, let's hear,
5341000	5343000	I want to hear Emily download about this.
5343000	5345000	We should have brought her up earlier.
5345000	5347000	I would just say, I spent many years working,
5347000	5349000	I was a therapist for many years working with kids
5349000	5351000	who were one step away from training school,
5351000	5353000	so they'd be gone forever.
5353000	5356000	Kids who were sexual predators to other kids.
5356000	5359000	Most likely, I love you Spencer, I'm so sorry.
5359000	5360000	Can you talk about boundaries in this?
5360000	5363000	Yeah, you and I discuss this very often.
5363000	5366000	And the need that you have to have,
5366000	5368000	when you're sitting across from a human being
5368000	5371000	who has tried to rape another child,
5371000	5373000	who is 14 and tried to rape another child,
5373000	5375000	you still have to have empathy for that kid.
5375000	5378000	You still have to, forgiveness isn't the right word,
5378000	5380000	but empathy, which you said several times,
5380000	5381000	that is the right word.
5381000	5384000	You have to be able to not feel what they're,
5384000	5385000	like going through and understand.
5385000	5386000	Compassion.
5386000	5387000	You have to be able to say,
5388000	5389000	there's something going on with you
5389000	5391000	that has you doing this.
5391000	5392000	And you're maybe never gonna get them
5392000	5393000	to stop wanting to fuck kids,
5393000	5395000	but you can get them, like an alcoholic,
5395000	5397000	to learn to avoid situations.
5397000	5398000	And that's all you work with them on,
5398000	5400000	it's like these day-to-day skills of like,
5400000	5402000	how do you avoid fucking a kid today?
5402000	5404000	I'm not saying you're not gonna fuck a kid tomorrow,
5404000	5406000	how do you get them to avoid doing it today?
5406000	5407000	And then it's just one day at a time shit.
5407000	5410000	And you hope you're not stuck in traffic on the next day,
5410000	5412000	you tell them that.
5412000	5415000	Well, the idea is that they get it, yeah.
5415000	5418000	Like, hey, Thursday, there was a wreck on the highway,
5418000	5419000	I fucked three kids.
5421000	5422000	It's a bad day for those kids.
5422000	5426000	But Emily, what do you think about imprisoning people who,
5428000	5430000	I mean, if they offend physically,
5430000	5432000	I think we all agree that, well,
5432000	5433000	prison is where we put people
5433000	5435000	who have physically offended, right?
5435000	5436000	Yeah.
5436000	5438000	And so it's like, what else are you gonna do?
5438000	5439000	Or just don't plot,
5439000	5441000	which we need to work on that part tremendously.
5441000	5443000	But it's also against the law, isn't it,
5443000	5447000	to consume, to view, to think, to feel.
5447000	5448000	Well, but if you consume,
5448000	5451000	then you're also supporting the act of someone,
5451000	5452000	childhood, and someone.
5452000	5453000	But those people go to prison, right?
5453000	5454000	Yeah, if you have child porn on your computer.
5454000	5455000	So they've done nothing.
5455000	5457000	So there's a weird part of the wall there.
5457000	5460000	They've supported the industry that they've made money
5460000	5461000	to the people.
5461000	5462000	Okay.
5462000	5463000	All right.
5463000	5464000	Yeah, they've supported that.
5464000	5466000	Okay, so if, for instance,
5466000	5470000	I were to ever give perhaps 35% of my salary
5470000	5472000	to something that would ever hurt young children,
5473000	5475000	like I don't know, like a bombing raid
5475000	5477000	on 20 countries at the same time.
5477000	5478000	You know there's a line between that.
5478000	5479000	Maybe I should go to prison.
5479000	5480000	Do you understand that there's a difference
5480000	5481000	between having to pay taxes?
5481000	5483000	The only line is the one that registers on her all, though.
5483000	5484000	That's the only line.
5484000	5485000	Here's the difference.
5485000	5486000	That's the only line.
5486000	5488000	No, the difference is having to pay taxes
5488000	5491000	versus knowingly giving money to something
5491000	5494000	that you know is going for a specific purpose.
5494000	5495000	Yeah, you're purchasing a service,
5495000	5496000	a good or a service,
5496000	5497000	and that good or a service is seeing a kid's name.
5497000	5498000	You know the difference.
5498000	5499000	I know the difference.
5499000	5502000	And so I get to keep plodding through my fucking life
5502000	5505000	and with me, you know, under a tombstone
5505000	5506000	in a certain system.
5506000	5509000	But like the idea that there's not that much difference
5509000	5512000	between that is, I think, important enough
5512000	5513000	to be stated.
5513000	5514000	It's important enough.
5514000	5518000	What do you think if there is someone who has fucked one kid
5518000	5519000	and you know just the one?
5519000	5521000	No, forget fucking one kid.
5521000	5522000	Fuck one kid.
5522000	5524000	Fucking do your bid.
5524000	5526000	That's my motto.
5526000	5527000	What do you mean?
5527000	5529000	That's my new senator.
5529000	5530000	That's your new motto?
5530000	5531000	Yeah, fuck one kid, do your bid.
5531000	5533000	That's a terrible, that's a terrible motto.
5533000	5535000	There's not a lot of stuff that rhymes with fuck one kid.
5535000	5536000	You know what sucks?
5536000	5537000	It's a t-shirt.
5537000	5539000	Do your bid has to be on the back.
5539000	5540000	Yeah, yeah.
5540000	5542000	So he just says, fuck one kid.
5542000	5543000	I walk around with it.
5543000	5545000	I swore by it.
5545000	5548000	Yeah, listen, at Starbucks, it's fine if they're behind you.
5548000	5551000	No, let's talk about the guy that, you know.
5551000	5553000	Yeah, who can't, what do you think?
5553000	5556000	The guy with the pictures on his laptop.
5556000	5558000	He's got a picture of a three-year-old kid.
5558000	5559000	Has he fucked one kid?
5559000	5560000	He's got a dick in his butt.
5560000	5561000	Has he fucked one kid?
5561000	5562000	No.
5562000	5563000	How many kids is that?
5563000	5564000	All he does is put the picture.
5564000	5566000	But it's a real picture of a kid betting butt fuck somewhere
5566000	5568000	and he has led to that kid getting butt fucked
5568000	5570000	by the fact that he supported that industry.
5570000	5573000	Yeah, that guy should definitely be in some kind of,
5573000	5576000	and then you gotta, oh god, it's so complicated
5576000	5578000	because you have to go with, does that guy want to stop?
5578000	5580000	Does that guy think what he's doing is wrong?
5580000	5581000	Does that guy want to stop?
5581000	5583000	That's the thing that I, like I haven't had all this.
5583000	5584000	Let's put him in prison next to a guy
5584000	5587000	who had a pot plant in his flower box
5587000	5588000	before we decided that was legal.
5588000	5590000	By the way, you've talked to pedophiles.
5590000	5591000	Do they, in your experience...
5591000	5593000	You've talked to pedophiles.
5593000	5596000	Dated a few.
5596000	5598000	Married to one.
5598000	5599000	She traded up.
5599000	5600000	She traded up, bro.
5600000	5603000	Yeah, I don't fuck kids.
5603000	5604000	I don't know if you got that.
5604000	5606000	Now you're getting that sweet chocolate mousse every night.
5606000	5607000	You know what?
5607000	5609000	I can't believe you keep telling people that.
5609000	5610000	I'm sorry.
5610000	5611000	I don't know.
5611000	5613000	By the way, my bid for the title of this episode
5613000	5616000	is Camille's Sweet Chocolate Mousse.
5616000	5618000	It's really my sweet chocolate mousse, I would say.
5618000	5619000	Emily's.
5619000	5623000	Do they know that what they're doing is wrong?
5623000	5624000	Yeah.
5624000	5625000	They do.
5625000	5626000	Absolutely.
5626000	5627000	They know it's immoral.
5627000	5628000	Yeah, absolutely.
5628000	5629000	That they shouldn't do it.
5629000	5630000	And I can't speak for everybody,
5630000	5632000	but everybody I've ever talked to absolutely is like,
5632000	5636000	I wish I didn't like this so much, but I do.
5636000	5637000	What do I do?
5637000	5638000	Yeah.
5638000	5640000	Didn't you like it, like, didn't like looking at it?
5640000	5642000	They wish they didn't like it, yeah.
5642000	5643000	But they do.
5643000	5644000	They hurt the kids.
5644000	5645000	Right.
5645000	5647000	Sometimes they do when I hurt the kids.
5647000	5652000	But when you have a kid who's 14 and he's acting out on 12-year-olds
5652000	5655000	because he himself was raped by someone older,
5655000	5658000	that's a tough call to blame that kid for what's happening.
5658000	5662000	They have D and D.
5662000	5663000	All right, yeah.
5663000	5666000	What kind of monsters are we fighting on D and D?
5666000	5669000	I think that we're going to go from a conversation about walls
5669000	5673000	into a dungeon, which is, if not, it's defined by its walls.
5673000	5674000	I'm completely into that.
5674000	5678000	I was kind of world's worst segue!
5678000	5679000	Oh.
5679000	5686000	I can do a real quick palate cleanser story if you want.
5686000	5687000	Do it.
5687000	5688000	It'll be real quick.
5688000	5691000	It's about, okay, so should I do it, Dan?
5691000	5692000	Yeah.
5692000	5693000	It'll take like five minutes.
5693000	5696000	We got 15 to do this.
5696000	5698000	All right, okay, well, it'll be real quick.
5698000	5701000	All right, okay, so when I was last...
5701000	5704000	At one point, I talked about my relationship with my parents.
5704000	5707000	This seems like a long story, but it's not.
5707000	5711000	It's weird where they never talk about my comedy or career or anything,
5711000	5713000	so I texted them.
5713000	5715000	I did a Comedy Central special a couple months ago,
5715000	5716000	and it was a big deal to me.
5716000	5717000	Thank you.
5717000	5718000	Thank you.
5718000	5721000	I did it for my first hour, and I've been doing stand-up for 10 years.
5721000	5724000	It was a big deal to me, so I texted them, and I was like,
5724000	5725000	hey, please watch it.
5725000	5727000	It means a lot to me.
5727000	5730000	So they watched it, and then I got a text from my dad,
5730000	5734000	and it said, saw your special.
5734000	5735000	That's it.
5735000	5736000	That was it.
5736000	5737000	That was the whole text.
5737000	5738000	No period at the end.
5738000	5739000	No period at the end.
5739000	5740000	Nothing.
5740000	5741000	Wow.
5741000	5742000	They put a period in your heart.
5742000	5746000	As if it's almost like my dad died during texting him.
5746000	5749000	Maybe there was a home invasion or something.
5749000	5750000	Yeah.
5750000	5751000	So I called him.
5751000	5752000	I was like, are you okay?
5752000	5753000	He's like, yeah, we're fine.
5753000	5756000	We saw your special.
5756000	5757000	It thickens.
5757000	5762000	Story gets a couple weeks later, I'm on Amazon reading reviews of my special,
5762000	5769000	and I see one from a certain Shabana Nanjiani.
5769000	5770000	That's mom.
5770000	5771000	That's my mom.
5771000	5772000	That's my mother-in-law.
5772000	5774000	That's my mom, and you could tell from this
5774000	5776000	that she doesn't know that her name's going to be on there.
5776000	5778000	She just logged in and reviewed it.
5778000	5779000	No, it's a good review.
5779000	5780000	It's a good review.
5780000	5781000	I hope she just going to die.
5781000	5782000	She just flamed you up.
5782000	5783000	No.
5783000	5785000	Who is this cocksucker?
5785000	5786000	That bitch.
5786000	5790000	That is the only way it would be better, but this is why.
5790000	5793000	The subject is no end to laughter.
5793000	5794000	That's the subject.
5794000	5795000	Now we're talking about it.
5795000	5798000	That's the, yeah, it's already kind of ESL though.
5798000	5799000	You know what I mean?
5799000	5801000	It gets way more ESL.
5801000	5803000	The description is, here's the words.
5803000	5806000	I watched the DVD and could not stop laughing.
5806000	5809000	They have very well performed.
5809000	5813000	None of the jokes could be called stale.
5813000	5814000	Not even one.
5815000	5817000	I have been watching other comedy stand-up shows,
5817000	5821000	so now she's like, listen, I've been around as well.
5821000	5823000	She's pretending like she's someone else.
5823000	5826000	I've seen a lot of stand-up comedy shows.
5826000	5828000	Okay, now listen to how, this next part,
5828000	5832000	listen to how it is almost a compliment, okay?
5832000	5836000	Pay attention to how this is almost a compliment.
5836000	5839000	I've been watching other stand-up comedy shows also,
5839000	5844000	but this one is by far amongst the top most.
5846000	5848000	Take you for your qualifier.
5848000	5851000	Her mom gland, like, seized up as she almost...
5851000	5852000	Almost there.
5852000	5856000	All jokes were, exactly, her mom gland seized up.
5856000	5859000	All jokes were crisp and extremely well executed.
5859000	5861000	Very fresh, very crunchy.
5861000	5862000	All I can say is...
5862000	5863000	He was adequate.
5863000	5865000	Yeah, yeah.
5865000	5868000	He spoke English into a microphone.
5869000	5872000	All I can say is, hats off to Beta Male.
5872000	5873000	Yay!
5873000	5875000	Good for her.
5875000	5877000	She's using the...
5877000	5879000	Three stars.
5879000	5881000	I'm joking, no, it's five.
5881000	5882000	It's five stars.
5882000	5883000	If someone read it, they'd be like,
5883000	5885000	it reads like a three-star review.
5885000	5890000	Camille, the amongst thing was her trying to not just write a love letter.
5890000	5892000	She was trying to believe it.
5892000	5895000	I can't believe I'm defending her when my mom does the same thing.
5895000	5897000	So I was telling my friend about this,
5897000	5900000	and my friend's like, you have to text her and tell her you read it
5900000	5901000	and that it meant a lot to you.
5901000	5904000	We have to break this barrier of you guys not talking about this.
5904000	5905000	It's a big part of your life.
5905000	5906000	Turn on these walls.
5906000	5907000	So I texted your mom.
5907000	5909000	Exactly.
5909000	5913000	I don't know if that's the best metaphor, but...
5913000	5914000	I hate walls now.
5914000	5917000	I texted my mom and I said, read your Amazon review.
5917000	5918000	Thank you so much.
5918000	5920000	It meant a lot to me that you enjoyed it.
5920000	5922000	It was amongst my favorite reviews.
5922000	5925000	Amongst the top most.
5925000	5926000	So I texted that.
5926000	5928000	It meant a lot to me that you enjoyed it.
5928000	5930000	No response for two days.
5930000	5932000	Here's the response.
5932000	5933000	Here's the response.
5933000	5934000	Two days later.
5934000	5936000	Saw Lee Daniels the butler.
5936000	5938000	Pretty good.
5938000	5939000	They like movies.
5939000	5941000	They really like movies.
5941000	5943000	That was the response.
5943000	5945000	Am I Lee Daniels the butler?
5945000	5947000	Is that what you're talking about?
5947000	5948000	My dad.
5948000	5949000	I have a great relationship with my dad.
5949000	5950000	He's very straightforward.
5950000	5953000	He's very stoic and cool and groovy and old-school.
5953000	5956000	I was on some new episodes of Whose Land Is It Anyway.
5956000	5957000	It's improv.
5957000	5959000	It's not the funniest show in the world.
5959000	5960000	It's short-form improv.
5960000	5961000	It's a great show.
5961000	5962000	It's a great show.
5962000	5964000	It's a fucking great show.
5964000	5966000	I don't put it up there with high art.
5966000	5967000	We're going up there.
5967000	5969000	We're doing make-a-mups.
5969000	5972000	I told my dad it was airing.
5972000	5974000	He normally calls me right away.
5974000	5975000	He did not call me.
5975000	5977000	So a week later, I called him up.
5977000	5979000	And we're talking about this and about that.
5979000	5981000	And he doesn't bring it up, which means I know what it means.
5981000	5982000	He doesn't like it.
5982000	5984000	And so I said, did you see the show?
5984000	5985000	He goes, yeah.
5985000	5986000	Yeah.
5986000	5987000	He goes, look, you were great on it.
5987000	5990000	But I told some friends from church to watch it.
5990000	5993000	He was like, I wish I would have known not to tell everybody
5993000	5996000	to watch it because I thought it was fine.
5996000	6000000	But the people I told to watch it, they're 80
6000000	6001000	and they go to church.
6001000	6004000	And Whose Land Is One of the Gayest Television Shows
6004000	6006000	in TV History?
6006000	6009000	I've made out with Colin Mockery more than most women I've dated.
6009000	6011000	And more than most women have made out
6011000	6015000	with Colin Mockery.
6015000	6018000	Let's play a lightning round D&D, lightning round.
6022000	6025000	When we last met, our heroes were ascending the stairs
6025000	6027000	of a tall tower.
6027000	6029000	Each stair they climbed was one stair closer
6029000	6031000	to Admiral Darkstar.
6031000	6033000	Then the gang reached a warm door.
6033000	6036000	And after checking for warm traps,
6036000	6038000	they bounded into the room.
6038000	6041000	The chamber's high ceilings were covered in chains
6041000	6044000	and three large stone lions stood watch
6044000	6046000	over a lone treasure chest in the room.
6046000	6049000	Mulrane opened the chest with Kristoburg's acid help
6049000	6052000	and obtained arrows and craft supplies.
6052000	6054000	Then Sharpie climbed one of the lions
6054000	6058000	and began removing one of the statue's glinting eyes
6058000	6060000	as the rest of the heroes also climbed
6060000	6063000	atop lion statues for some reason.
6063000	6066000	Sharpie's prying was rewarded by an ominous rumbling
6066000	6068000	that shook the entire keep.
6068000	6070000	It was scary.
6070000	6072000	But what did it mean?
6072000	6076000	We'll find out now on an all-new episode of Harmontown.
6082000	6084000	I wonder if we'll find out.
6084000	6086000	Seems like your mom is probably the person
6086000	6088000	you learned to be funny from.
6088000	6090000	She's a little bummed out.
6090000	6091000	What do you mean?
6091000	6092000	That's true. Your mom is funnier.
6092000	6093000	Sharpie, what are you talking about?
6093000	6094000	Funnier?
6095000	6096000	Nothing new.
6096000	6098000	I would say she's funnier than your dad.
6098000	6099000	She's sneak attack funny.
6099000	6100000	Yeah, my parents are funny.
6100000	6102000	They just have a weird thing with my...
6102000	6104000	Okay, my parents are getting divorced.
6106000	6108000	So where am I right now?
6110000	6112000	Hey Spencer, we're trying to play D&D here.
6112000	6115000	Yeah, I thought it might actually work.
6115000	6117000	Lightning round.
6117000	6121000	So you're on top of a statue, quark.
6121000	6122000	Doing what? I wasn't here last week.
6122000	6123000	You're just standing there to my knowledge.
6124000	6126000	Do you think you were the only reason
6126000	6127000	why your parents were staying together?
6127000	6128000	Oh yeah, you know.
6128000	6129000	Now that you moved out?
6129000	6131000	No, I just thought if I brought it up,
6131000	6132000	we'd play Dungeons and Dragons.
6132000	6133000	Is that really what it is?
6133000	6135000	You moved out and now they're getting divorced?
6135000	6136000	Yeah, like a couple of months later.
6136000	6137000	Is that right?
6137000	6138000	Yeah, well I told them.
6138000	6140000	I was the only thing holding their marriage together.
6140000	6143000	So kids usually as a...
6143000	6145000	When I was 10, my parents separated.
6145000	6147000	Kids blame themselves for the separation.
6147000	6148000	That's the whole idea.
6148000	6150000	But I feel like it really is his fault.
6150000	6151000	Yeah.
6151000	6152000	He's right this time.
6152000	6153000	He couldn't be happier.
6153000	6154000	You're happy they're getting...
6154000	6156000	Well, I mean, I always wanted to make them get divorced,
6156000	6158000	and this counts, right?
6158000	6160000	Listen, no, he's right.
6160000	6161000	He knows his parents,
6161000	6163000	and if he thinks they're better off not with each other...
6163000	6165000	No, no, I just want him to all be miserable.
6167000	6169000	Well, I will say, if your parents out there
6169000	6171000	and you're staying together for the kids,
6171000	6174000	go fuck yourself on behalf of the kids of the world.
6174000	6175000	Yeah.
6175000	6176000	Separate.
6176000	6177000	All the kids.
6177000	6178000	We're human beings.
6179000	6182000	I have seven billion exhibit A's.
6184000	6186000	And whether or not you staying together
6186000	6188000	makes everything work.
6188000	6189000	Fuck you.
6189000	6192000	Like split up, you fucking dicks.
6192000	6194000	Stop blaming me for your marriage.
6194000	6196000	I'm on a statue.
6198000	6200000	Yeah, you guys are all on stone lion statues.
6200000	6203000	They're each about 15 feet tall,
6203000	6204000	and everything's rumbling.
6204000	6205000	It's all rumbly.
6205000	6207000	Like your parents' marriage.
6208000	6210000	Yeah, like the crumbling stones
6210000	6212000	of the foundations of marriage.
6212000	6213000	All the marriages.
6213000	6216000	Or the walls that are keeping the pedophiles out.
6216000	6218000	Same stone, same stone.
6218000	6220000	Argument can be made.
6221000	6223000	Build your walls, build your lions.
6223000	6224000	It all falls down.
6224000	6226000	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
6228000	6229000	I jump off of my statue
6229000	6231000	and go toward the doorway we came in through.
6231000	6232000	Okay.
6232000	6233000	You do that.
6233000	6235000	The rumbling doesn't diminish any.
6235000	6237000	In fact, it increases.
6237000	6239000	Do we know where the rumbling is coming from?
6239000	6240000	It's coming from everywhere.
6240000	6242000	It's like an earthquake.
6243000	6245000	Now, who plucked out the eyeballs?
6245000	6248000	He pulled out, or he was trying to pry out
6248000	6249000	one of the eyeballs,
6249000	6252000	and you're given a real, real workings.
6252000	6253000	Isn't it?
6253000	6254000	A real workings.
6254000	6258000	Yeah, a real workings is the old gnome term for it.
6258000	6260000	Should we try and put the eyeballs back in?
6260000	6261000	It's not out yet.
6261000	6262000	Oh, it's not even out yet.
6262000	6263000	No, shit.
6263000	6265000	So you trying to get the eyeball out
6265000	6266000	is what made this rumble start happening?
6266000	6267000	Perhaps.
6267000	6268000	That's what we think, yeah.
6268000	6269000	Yeah.
6269000	6270000	Quit messing with those eyeballs.
6270000	6271000	I push it back in.
6271000	6272000	All right.
6272000	6273000	What about those chains that were dangling?
6273000	6274000	They're still dangling.
6274000	6275000	Do we climb them?
6275000	6276000	Do we know about those chains?
6276000	6278000	Yeah, I mean, you know they're on the ceiling.
6278000	6281000	You could climb them if you're on a statue,
6281000	6282000	but Clark's not on a statue.
6282000	6283000	The rest of you guys are.
6283000	6284000	Yeah, you just jumped down.
6284000	6286000	I get back on my statue.
6286000	6288000	It's not your turn, bro.
6289000	6290000	We're not in combat right now.
6290000	6291000	I can do whatever I want.
6291000	6292000	Get back up there.
6292000	6293000	Don't tell me what to do.
6293000	6294000	No, no, no.
6294000	6295000	If you like.
6295000	6296000	Don't build walls around me.
6296000	6297000	You can get up there.
6297000	6298000	All right.
6298000	6299000	I'm back on my statue.
6299000	6300000	Yeah.
6300000	6301000	Sounds good.
6301000	6303000	Does anyone else want to try anything?
6303000	6305000	I'm going to try to climb one of the chains
6305000	6307000	and see what happens.
6307000	6308000	I like that.
6308000	6309000	Uh-oh.
6309000	6310000	He's going for the dice.
6310000	6311000	Oh, he's getting on his dice.
6311000	6313000	He's like a real game and everything.
6313000	6316000	You climb atop the chains.
6316000	6319000	Now you're hanging from chains.
6320000	6322000	I passed that president's fitness test.
6322000	6323000	I can do this for a while.
6323000	6324000	Oh, yeah.
6324000	6327000	So you hear the rumbling.
6327000	6328000	It was intensifying.
6328000	6330000	Now it stops completely.
6330000	6332000	And as soon as it stops, you hear,
6332000	6334000	it sounds like a viscous fluid.
6334000	6336000	And out of the mouths of these lions
6336000	6338000	pours hot, bubbling, glowing lava.
6338000	6339000	See?
6339000	6340000	And it begins filling up,
6340000	6342000	filling up this floor here.
6342000	6343000	Oh, you guys better get on these chains.
6343000	6345000	So now the floors, they're all,
6345000	6346000	they're all lava-y.
6346000	6348000	Oh, but we're safe on top of our statues, right?
6348000	6349000	Currently.
6349000	6350000	Currently.
6350000	6351000	Yeah.
6351000	6352000	All right.
6352000	6353000	Good move on my part to be on top of these things.
6353000	6355000	Hey, Maureen, what do you see on top of that chain?
6355000	6357000	Is there anything up at the top of it?
6357000	6359000	So from your vantage point, like,
6359000	6360000	you can only see more chains.
6360000	6363000	So it's almost like there's a huge canopy of chains
6363000	6365000	above your head that's blocking above,
6365000	6367000	but you can only see blackness.
6367000	6369000	And you're just on one of these dangling ones.
6369000	6370000	So you'd have to climb up.
6370000	6371000	Does anybody have a light?
6371000	6372000	Does anybody have a light?
6372000	6373000	I don't...
6373000	6375000	I can cast light.
6375000	6377000	I have low-light vision.
6377000	6378000	Neither one of those do things.
6378000	6379000	And I have a torch.
6379000	6380000	You want a torch?
6380000	6381000	Yeah.
6381000	6382000	She's up there, so...
6382000	6383000	Well, you guys can climb up a chain.
6383000	6384000	Yeah, come up here.
6384000	6386000	I jump to a chain and start climbing up a chain.
6386000	6388000	My arms are so strong.
6388000	6389000	You don't.
6389000	6391000	I have a 12-climb.
6391000	6392000	A 12-climb?
6392000	6393000	Bonus.
6393000	6394000	Modifier.
6394000	6395000	Yeah.
6395000	6396000	Well, what's your acrobatics?
6396000	6397000	I mean, your...
6397000	6399000	Yeah, acrobatics?
6399000	6401000	It's jumping 3.5.
6401000	6402000	I'm sorry.
6402000	6403000	11.
6403000	6404000	11.
6404000	6405000	Okay.
6405000	6406000	Well, see, that counts.
6406000	6408000	You jump onto the chain.
6408000	6411000	And you grab it with both hands.
6411000	6412000	All right.
6412000	6414000	It's a different chain than the one she's on.
6414000	6415000	Correct.
6415000	6416000	Correct.
6416000	6417000	I start climbing up it.
6417000	6418000	All right.
6418000	6420000	You do so with great gusto.
6420000	6422000	Love it.
6422000	6424000	Is everyone climbing chains?
6424000	6426000	Should I jump on a chain or...?
6426000	6428000	Do what you want, man.
6428000	6429000	It seems pretty...
6429000	6430000	All right.
6430000	6432000	Seems like a good idea so far.
6433000	6436000	Do I have anything so she can see because it's dark up there?
6436000	6437000	Is there anything I can do?
6437000	6438000	Do you have a torch?
6438000	6440000	Oh, you have the goggles of night.
6440000	6441000	Me do?
6441000	6442000	Yeah.
6442000	6443000	You do.
6446000	6448000	Me threw goggles that night.
6448000	6450000	Me do some big workings.
6450000	6452000	Can I throw them to her?
6452000	6453000	Yeah.
6453000	6454000	Is there a chance she won't catch it?
6454000	6455000	Definitely.
6455000	6456000	Yeah.
6456000	6457000	All right.
6457000	6461000	I feel like his role playing is less coxure because his wife is...
6461000	6462000	Yeah.
6462000	6463000	Get in here.
6463000	6464000	In the mix.
6464000	6466000	Well, I get on the chain that this...
6466000	6468000	Honey, don't hire yourself.
6468000	6470000	That this person unknown to me is on.
6470000	6472000	And I climb all the way up and I go,
6472000	6476000	Hey, honey, here's the goggles of night.
6476000	6480000	Leaping, leaping onto the chains, you do as you described
6480000	6482000	and you give her the goggles of night.
6482000	6483000	Okay.
6483000	6484000	So I put the goggles on.
6484000	6485000	I'm looking up.
6485000	6486000	Oh, man.
6486000	6490000	I see a large metal hatch in the ceiling through all these chains.
6490000	6491000	Yeah.
6491000	6493000	I climb.
6493000	6494000	Go the hatch.
6494000	6495000	I climb to the hatch.
6495000	6497000	But before you could climb to the hatch,
6497000	6501000	you hear a voice call out echoing through the chamber above.
6501000	6504000	You've managed to live.
6504000	6507000	You've managed to last.
6507000	6513000	But how can you handle this blast from your past?
6513000	6518000	Good, Brendan Fraser.
6518000	6522000	So, and on hearing that,
6522000	6525000	the hatch in the ceiling that only you can see begins to open
6525000	6531000	and you see the large multi-legged form coming out of this hole.
6531000	6532000	Tell us about it.
6532000	6533000	I'm freaking out, man.
6533000	6536000	Oh, you're freaking out.
6536000	6539000	It looks like a cross between some sort of spider and humanoid.
6539000	6542000	You see three of its legs are replaced with metal spikes.
6542000	6543000	Oh, no.
6543000	6548000	It has several scars on its body and it has a large hole in the back of its head.
6548000	6550000	It's covered in metal place.
6550000	6551000	It's breathy.
6551000	6553000	Is this the one that I thought when he was dead?
6553000	6554000	Yeah.
6554000	6555000	It's breathy.
6555000	6556000	Oh, breathy now.
6556000	6558000	You hear a metallic voice ring out.
6558000	6560000	I'm breathy.
6560000	6563000	Oh, cliffhanger.
6563000	6569000	Thank you, everybody, for coming to Harment Town.
6569000	6573000	On an all pedophilia night.
6573000	6578000	Listen, don't build a wall between yourself and a pedophile tonight.
6578000	6581000	Find one pedophile and lower the wall.
6581000	6583000	No, don't do that.
6583000	6586000	Let's thank Lauren, Adam, Kelly, was it?
6586000	6591000	Laura, Emily Gordon, Camille Nangiani, Spencer Critton,
6591000	6593000	and I'm Jeff Davis, your comptroller.
6593000	6600000	One more time for Dan Harmon, the mayor of Harment Town.
6600000	6603000	We didn't really make it to the moon, but we got pretty close.
6603000	6604000	I know what it is.
6604000	6607000	If it's easy to hate somebody, maybe don't hate them.
6607000	6612000	If it's hard to hate somebody, maybe hate them.
6612000	6614000	That's what I was trying to get through to.
6614000	6615000	Good night.
6615000	6616000	See you at the drawing room.
6616000	6619000	You just broke for a while, my friend.
