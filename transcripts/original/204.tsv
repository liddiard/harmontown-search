0	13280	From Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the nerdest, smeltiest, smeltiest, melt-theater,
13280	17120	Harman Town is now in session.
17120	24240	Let's bring on Spencer Crittenden.
24240	41520	The mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
41520	42720	Thank you so much.
42720	49120	I really want to apologize, I'm so sorry about the amount of Nidoran that are here.
49120	57520	Oh man, it's one of the Pokemons.
57520	61160	I wanted to gauge how pervasive this was overnight.
61160	69320	I downloaded it today and I'm at level four and I've already wandered into traffic for
69320	76400	a Pokemon and then I've already had, like Cody and I, we walked a block to stop at some
76400	83320	Pokey stops and we are, so we already had the first, a guy stop his car and go, let
83320	86320	me guess, Pokemon?
86320	87320	Wait for real?
87320	94360	That guy, that guy's not an official part of the game, but, like, how do you know he,
94360	98440	and then Cody and I walked, and Cody's like, wow, this game's so popular, I'm like, yeah,
98440	104160	it's so popular, it's created a sub-biosphere of fucking rapey dudes trying to, like, it's
104160	109160	like, how do you, yeah, Pokemon, it's like, well, tell you what, I don't get it, but get
109160	111160	in my car, let's talk about it.
111160	119880	It was okay, what are you doing over there, you're playing that Pokemon, can I fuck you?
119880	121880	Sorry, is it weird that I went there?
121880	124880	Because otherwise, what's he doing, is that a positive thing?
124880	128440	And he's like, god damn it, if that's not two young people playing Pokemon, oh, one's
128440	129440	old, okay.
129440	132440	Hey, what's going on with the Pokemons?
133200	137640	But how can he tell you're playing Pokemons, because you were looking at your phone and
137640	141440	being excited, while playing skeeball and a fake thing?
141440	147600	Well, that's an expression of, like, how explosively popular this game got overnight, is that he
147600	155000	saw two people just looking at their phones, so last Tuesday, he would have gone, you fucking
155240	157240	looking for a god damn Yelp.
157240	161080	You guys, you words with friendsers?
161080	165960	Yeah, exactly, he would have just, like, there's been some general thing, he would have just
165960	171480	called us Jews or something, I don't know, whatever his hang up is, but that guy, it
171480	176760	had reached his life, even though he's from New Jersey and is driving a gremlin from a
176760	183680	portal from 1975 straight through, as he just crosses his trans-dimensional, you know, like,
183680	189320	weird trailer park, Doctor Strange Journey, like, as he goes through, that he saw us and
189320	193480	was like, like, ahh, Pokemon, I bet, anyways, I just didn't like the guy, I didn't like
193480	199040	his style, I didn't like that he looked at my woman, but he was, he was right though,
199040	203960	he was hip to your job, we were playing Pokemon, and I haven't, obviously I haven't caught
203960	204960	them all.
204960	208560	Can you catch all the Pokemons?
208560	209560	Allegedly.
210440	211440	Allegedly.
211440	216920	I got some snake snitchers, I got some mitten, mitten asses, some, I got, I got kitten, kitten,
216920	220280	kitten bitches, and fucking, like, like, stamp, stamp, stamp.
220280	225240	Now, the elusive kitten bitch, I can't believe you got that at level 4, I thought that was
225240	227720	more like a level 10 Pokemon.
227720	231640	But here's the amazing, like, when Dungeons and Dragons became popular, or like, Space
231640	236640	Invaders, like, I felt, like, there's been, like, if you, if you go back into the archives,
236640	241920	it's kind of funny, through your young eyes, if you would look at, like, like, go, go,
241920	248480	just go Google, like, Space Invaders, uh, uh, I'm trying to, like, what the phrase would
248480	256040	be, like, threat to society, or something like, like, some 1978, like, Tom Brokaw video
256040	261480	about Space Invaders and what, I was like, a news story about how a guy murdered his
261480	267240	wife because he, she wouldn't let him keep playing Space Invaders, and, um, uh, people
267240	274320	talking about, they call it Space Invader Thumb, uh, more commonly known as Carball
274320	280480	Tunnel, but, yeah, definitely, Space Invaders is, uh, causing this, and, uh, just, like,
280480	284440	and then the Dungeons and Dragons with the people under the tunnels, I, I, I, there was
284440	288320	a thing in the, they were under the tunnels, they weren't even in the tunnels, they were
289080	291080	They would go underneath the tunnels.
291080	295840	Yeah, these are, these are D&D people, they don't, they don't cut into tunnels, man.
295840	296840	That's underground.
296840	297840	They're, they're, they're underneath.
297840	303680	Yeah, there's, uh, in the 80s Dungeons and Dragons was, like, uh, gangster rap, it was
303680	309360	like, it was like, it was like, it was the thing that moms were worried about, and, uh,
309360	314600	and there was, and there was an urban legend that in colleges they would play the game
314600	318120	and then they would sacrifice, and then there were, like, steam tunnels underneath the
318120	324000	campuses and these kids had, it was a very similar to the baby alligator legend.
324000	329200	That's like the, the idea that, like, anything that seems innocent could, like, go down underneath
329200	335920	your world and grow into something, um, monstrous, um, it's, it's, it's, it's an urban legend
335920	339960	about, like, what's happening under your nose, uh, and, and, so, the Dungeons and Dragons
339960	344640	was like, these kids go down, they, they, they, they start playing this game with dice and
344640	350240	then they sink down through the soil of the campus you paid for and into these tunnels
350240	354800	and they, and they pull out real swords and they start stabbing each other and that was
354800	359960	all based on one kid who went missing, uh, from one college and it turned out way more
359960	366600	to do with heroin and, and, and, and, and also he was like a 15 year old kid going to
366600	370920	school with, he was like, worms are in Revenge of the Nerds, he was like, that archetype
370920	374840	was like, he was so smart that they said, well, you should skip high school, right?
374840	380560	You might be Einstein and put him in this, a school with 20 year olds and he was 15.
380560	385720	He had so many more things to deal with than Dungeons and Dragons, uh, but no one ever
385720	391280	said, oh, well, our class system is making people stab, disappear, and anyways, uh, yeah,
391280	395160	he came back after a while and said, no, I just shot smack and sucked a couple dicks.
395160	399560	Like I, like, I, I wanted to see the world, I figured out you morons were going to show
399560	402320	it to me, locking me up on this shithole.
402320	406920	Like he just fucking wandered off and crashed to the dude's house and was like, like, like,
406920	410200	like, yeah, like getting high, like making love.
410200	415880	And then he came back and was like, all right, I'm 16 now, time to get down to business.
415880	417760	And then they were like, but what about the Dungeons and Dragons?
417760	418760	He was like, what, what?
418760	419760	I said, what?
419760	420760	What?
420760	421760	No.
421760	422760	Any morons?
422760	423760	Anyways, I forgot where I was.
423760	424760	I'm sorry.
424760	425760	I, the, the Pokemons.
425760	426760	Yeah.
427680	431520	When you level up enough, level five, as I understand it, you can start joining a team.
431520	432520	Yeah.
432520	433520	That's, that's my goal.
433520	434520	Yellow!
434520	435520	Yellow!
435520	438120	Wait, you're all on the same team?
438120	439120	No!
439120	441120	Wait, Jesus Christ.
441120	444720	No, you can be on your own team.
444720	445720	This seems healthy.
445720	446720	Wait, no, you can't.
446720	449760	Wait, you have to pick one of the three?
449760	453120	You get to pick from three primary colors.
453120	455480	Why are you, why are you guys so vehemently yellow?
455480	457480	Because fuck up, because I'm Asian.
457480	459480	Oh, God.
459480	462480	This seems like a bad road.
462480	463480	All right.
463480	465480	I don't approve of this anymore.
465480	468480	It makes me want to go shoot smack and suck a couple dicks.
468480	469480	Honestly.
469480	475480	It seems like the easier road.
475480	480040	That guy that shouted yellow because I'm Asian, like, like, is he going to go home and write
480040	485960	a Facebook essay about Black Lives Matter or anything, like, like, and not connect the
485960	486960	dots?
486960	490440	Like, people, like, like, all right, let's not let our Pokemon, I thought you collected
490440	491440	little, little gagas.
491440	493440	I didn't think you had to choose between three races.
493440	495440	Are there any blues or reds here?
495440	496440	Okay.
496440	498800	Oh, so it's evenly dispersed.
498800	501440	But why were the yellows so vocal up front?
501440	504360	Because I'm in the front row!
504360	507400	Okay, Jesus Christ.
507400	510080	There's a lot of yellow people shifting to blue because of you tonight.
510080	514800	Because they're like, uh, I was like, no one knows what the culture is yet.
514800	516280	They're like, what are the stereotypes?
516280	518600	Do blue people drive like this?
518600	522960	Do yellow women move in with each other right away?
522960	523960	I don't know yet.
523960	526120	I need to talk to some people out in the real world.
526120	528680	Oh, uh, snaker, snaker clowder!
528680	532560	Are you, are you, are you capturing Pokemons on stage?
532560	535560	No, I was, well, that was an imaginary one.
535560	539280	I didn't, I didn't do a good job of riffing the name of one, did I?
539280	540280	Snaker clowder.
540280	541280	Let me check my hand.
541280	545000	But this game was, I, Dan and Cody talked me into downloading it.
545000	546000	I looked at it.
546000	550400	It looks like Google maps, but there's little dragons on it.
550400	554120	And then you're walking around a map of your neighborhood and it's trying to convince me
554120	560840	to walk down an alleyway where I'm certainly going to be waylaid by, by thugs.
560840	563960	Yeah, that's already the thing is there's already, uh...
563960	564960	Forty people have died already.
565360	566360	Forty confirmed deaths.
566360	571160	No, everyone's walking into traffic, but also there's already two stories that are like
571160	572160	top of the...
572160	577960	Usually when you swipe too far left on your iPhone, you get four, four of the stories
577960	581720	from the state, state, state controlled media.
581720	586320	The top three are Donald Trump said something orange and the bottom one is Hillary Clinton
586320	590560	went, is she too much or too little, this or that?
590560	595360	And then the, but one of them is like a Pokemon robbery ring.
595360	599040	These guys, these guys lure you to a Pokemon place and they rob you.
599040	601800	I think it's the, I think it's the yellows.
601800	602800	It's gotta be the yellows.
602800	607840	I mean, this, it seems like the yellows are more likely to get you, but do I have to learn
607840	608840	all new things?
608840	611840	Cause the Asian guy was like vehemently yellow.
611840	613240	So do we have to connect those dots?
613240	619160	Are the yellows like strategic and sly or are we switching it up?
619160	620160	Is that the joy of it?
620160	625680	Is that the yellows are like belligerent and they drop out of high school.
625680	627480	You vocal sir on the front row.
627480	628480	You're a yellow, right?
628480	629480	Yes.
629480	630480	Is there a yellow identity?
630480	632520	It's team insight.
632520	633520	Team insight.
633520	638920	Electric Thunderbird as our logo.
638920	641680	If that's not made up, it's a...
641680	644320	But what do you think about the blues and the reds?
644320	645720	Define the blues from me yellows.
645720	647600	They're a bunch of fucking tools.
647600	648600	A bunch of tools.
648600	649600	Oh shit.
650040	651360	A bunch of fuckers.
651360	652360	A bunch of fuckay.
652360	653360	This is...
653360	660320	You gotta pepper it with like, oh, you mean blue bros?
660320	662320	Like I think you go like, like, yeah, they...
662320	669720	I go at 3am to get the elementary school near my house and then I go...
669720	673600	You go at 3am to the elementary school near your house.
673600	674600	Keep talking.
674600	675600	To capture it.
675600	678600	To capture the elementary school.
679600	682600	When there's no children present.
682600	683600	I know.
683600	686600	You get three pokeballs when you walk by it.
686600	687600	No, no, no.
687600	688600	This is a gym.
688600	689600	Oh.
689600	690600	Oh.
690600	691600	You battle at the children's school.
691600	694600	I battle the gym and I take it for team yellow.
694600	695600	But you go there at...
695600	697600	You literally go there at 3am?
697600	704600	You are prowling a elementary school gymnasium at 3am to take control away from kids.
704600	707600	To capture the children's gym.
708600	712600	To take it from children when they're not there to defend themselves.
712600	713600	Exactly.
713600	714600	Exactly.
714600	715600	Children.
715600	716600	Children.
716600	717600	Elementary school.
717600	721600	Then I go to sleep and when I wake up I go back to elementary school and those blue fuckers
721600	722600	have taken it.
722600	725600	Well, yeah, because they're less weird.
725600	728600	That's fucking horrifying.
728600	729600	Why are...
729600	730600	How old are you?
730600	731600	22.
731600	732600	22.
732600	736600	So you got 22-year-olds literally physically outside elementary school?
736600	742600	Yeah, they're setting up poke lures and hiding in the bushes, rooting through tall grass,
742600	744600	waiting for kindergartners to lurk by.
744600	750600	The game is simply setting waypoints for a very rudimentary scavenger hunt.
750600	755600	It's sort of been used in jogging apps where you pick up apples by cross training.
755600	756600	All training.
756600	758600	Yeah, Waze too kind of has smell on it.
758600	759600	Yeah, Waze is...
759600	761600	I'm not pissing at it, but I just think it's amazing that we've...
762600	764600	And I'm seeing it as...
764600	770600	I'm all into it, but I'm stepping back and going how funny it is that they made us leave
770600	772600	our apartment and then like...
772600	775600	The first thing that's happening is all these news stories about like, yeah, and then someone
775600	777600	got raped.
778600	782600	Have you heard about the person that's using it to start a million dollar business?
782600	789600	They call it Pokemon-ing and it's getting people moving around the street corners.
789600	793600	My daughter started selling lemonade and she said there was a Pokemon there and someone
793600	794600	came and talked to her.
794600	795600	It sounds like the Warriors...
795600	798600	Hey, yellows.
798600	802600	You got to make it down to Coney Island before sunrise.
802600	804600	Can you dig it?
804600	805600	Suckers!
805600	806600	Oh my God.
806600	809600	And then you got some blues coming after you and some fucking...
809600	812600	Have you guys seen the Warriors the Minute?
812600	813600	Yeah.
814600	815600	Oh yeah.
815600	816600	So it's a cult classic.
816600	817600	You guys are...
817600	822600	This is like 200 creepily hip people here.
822600	824600	You mean good looking.
824600	825600	They're good looking.
825600	826600	But that's...
826600	831600	We're one guitar player away from a hot music video going on right now.
831600	836600	Yeah, the Shakespearean herald or what Joss Whedon, Cabot of the Woods maybe would call
836600	846600	a harbinger in Warriors is a foxy black DJ lady and all you ever see are her lips I think.
846600	850600	They're like these glossy lips like one centimeter from...
850600	851600	Hello children.
851600	853600	Hey, Bloods.
853600	859600	So it seems like the Warriors are on the ticky-tock tonight trying to make it from 3rd to Main
859600	860600	Street.
860600	864600	God bless you if you can get through the baseball boys.
865600	866600	The baseball furies.
866600	872600	They were basically on like I guess an Odyssean journey like going through the boroughs of
872600	875600	New York and getting attacked by thematic gangs.
875600	878600	But I just think it's amazing that the...
878600	879600	I don't know if we...
879600	882600	I bet we never saw that lady's eyes.
882600	883600	She was like this...
883600	890600	You just saw these foxy 70s lips and they shot that out in an hour.
890600	892600	Imagine them shooting that.
892600	893600	Okay, Carly.
893600	895600	Okay, so it's like page 3?
895600	896600	Okay, all right.
896600	897600	So a series of them?
897600	898600	Yeah.
898600	900600	Warriors, watch out.
900600	902600	Warriors, watch out.
902600	903600	Come on.
903600	904600	Fox it up.
904600	905600	Come on.
905600	906600	You're foxy.
906600	907600	Anyways.
907600	912600	I think you have a different relationship with that movie than I do.
912600	915600	In my childhood, that was on select TV.
915600	916600	I'll explain it later.
916600	921600	But the Warriors, I saw it so many times with my brother that one day my brother was like,
921600	923600	we should be like one of these gangs.
923600	925600	Yeah, we should.
925600	928600	And we were the baseball bat boys.
928600	932600	Like the baseball got so we ran around the neighborhood with baseball bats.
932600	938600	Hashtag white privilege means like seeing a movie and deciding to run around your neighborhood
938600	943600	with a baseball bat and then later on the story ends with me hanging out and doing a
943600	946600	podcast instead of some horrible thing.
946600	949600	I looked back and I was like, what the fuck were we doing?
949600	950600	We were running around.
950600	955600	We saw a movie that said it was cool to run around with baseball bats, got baseball bats
955600	960600	from the garage and emulated the characters by running around the neighborhood with baseball
960600	963600	bats in our hands like looking to beat people up.
963600	967600	We didn't do it, but we were like in our heads we were like, we're a gang.
967600	970600	We're playing gang gang.
970600	973600	So it was a simpler time, man.
973600	977600	Matt Gorley and I in like eighth grade, we would go into the Whitwood Mall in Whittier
977600	981600	and we had, did they get a what for Whitwood Mall?
981600	982600	For real.
982600	983600	Oh, wow.
983600	985600	Sorry.
985600	988600	To get all your what-what's, go to Whitford.
988600	993600	The Warriors are, don't get wasted fools.
993600	995600	We would go in there.
995600	1002600	Matt Gorley had replica guns and we would go and put them in our belts under our shirts
1002600	1006600	and walk through a mall because we were playing James Bond.
1006600	1007600	Right.
1007600	1012600	And we were walking through the mall with Walther P-38s and PPKs.
1012600	1016600	We had never had any intention of pulling them out or scaring anybody, but we really,
1016600	1019600	that was a horrible intention.
1019600	1026600	I don't know if this is topside or not, but here's a little fun time activity I did once.
1026600	1029600	Me and my friend Dan Ramstack, living in our lower village.
1029600	1030600	Ramstack.
1030600	1032600	I'll never get over that name, by the way.
1032600	1035600	We made a fake bomb once.
1035600	1037600	Oh, I made real bombs?
1037600	1039600	I made real pipe bombs.
1039600	1044600	We learned how to light blink and we made it purposely look like a bomb.
1044600	1047600	We made it look weird and dramatic.
1047600	1050600	MacGyver with blinking lights and red blue on wires.
1050600	1058600	And we put it on a telephone pole and then ran away because we were cognizant of the
1059600	1061600	terror that we were causing.
1061600	1064600	We weren't like, oh, and everyone will...
1064600	1070600	Because this is right after the Archduke Ferdinand was killed before that set off World War I.
1070600	1071600	You were part of the Blackfists.
1071600	1074600	I just remember I had electrical tape on the back of it.
1074600	1080600	And the last thing that we did before the authorities got involved is we stuck it to
1080600	1086600	the bottom of the screen door of my neighbor and rang the doorbell.
1087600	1093600	So when he came to the screen door, he looked down and saw this weird mass of E.T.
1093600	1097600	kind of circuit boards and things with a blinking light on it.
1097600	1104600	And he just called the cops.
1104600	1109600	The crazy shit, like a bomb squad came.
1109600	1114600	But it was the 80s, but he must have called them and said,
1115600	1117600	there's a bomb on my door.
1117600	1118600	I don't know.
1118600	1119600	I don't know.
1119600	1120600	This story didn't go away.
1120600	1121600	It's a simpler time.
1121600	1122600	We did a thing that...
1122600	1124600	The kids, the richer kids, they had pools.
1124600	1126600	We would go into their...
1126600	1129600	We'd sneak into their backyards and take the pool acid.
1129600	1132600	It was like a heavy-duty acid that would clean the pool.
1132600	1139600	And if you took a certain amount of that and you put it in a 2-liter 7-up or a Coke bottle
1139600	1142600	and rolled up some tin foil and put it in that,
1142600	1147600	you had about like a minute and a half head start to get the fuck out of town.
1147600	1151600	And we would put it in people's metal mailboxes.
1151600	1154600	And the gas would expand that and blow up the mailbox.
1154600	1158600	And it was an anti-personnel.
1158600	1163600	And we would just drive around town blowing shit up.
1163600	1166600	Here's another one you shouldn't do.
1166600	1171600	If you live on a hill, we would steal bowling balls from the bowling alley.
1173600	1178600	And we'd go up to where the rich kids lived up in the high hills with a long street that goes straight down.
1178600	1183600	And you would take lighter fluid and you would cover the bowling ball in lighter fluid
1183600	1188600	and fill the holes up with lighter fluid and light it on fire and just send it down the road.
1188600	1193600	Because when it got there, it was going through four walls on fire.
1193600	1197600	I don't know how I ever didn't do federal time.
1197600	1202600	Well, to segue into that, not to bring the show to a grinding halt,
1202600	1205600	but I did want to...
1205600	1210600	How much of that do you tie to this new word privilege?
1210600	1217600	Like, do you look back on that and go, oh, I had no idea that I was doing shit and getting away with it.
1217600	1221600	The black guy on the front row just ran out of here.
1221600	1225600	I mean, he didn't just walk out.
1225600	1228600	He scurried.
1228600	1233600	Well, he was like, I come here to get away from this shit.
1233600	1237600	I thought he'd talk about Pokemon.
1237600	1240600	Oh, no, certainly.
1240600	1243600	The hashtag, is it white privilege means?
1243600	1246600	Is that what it is? They just had a little swell.
1246600	1251600	And I clicked on it because I knew what I was going to see and I wanted to study the...
1251600	1255600	It's just like a little pastiche of like, I kind of feel like...
1255600	1260600	As you look at it and you just shudder, and sometimes you're mostly shuddering, of course,
1260600	1266600	when you're seeing the reflexive, reverse, defensive racism.
1266600	1269600	So you see the...
1269600	1273600	It's just like this weird outrage where it's like...
1273600	1278600	It's like somebody going like, no matter what you do,
1278600	1281600	it's not good enough because you're white.
1281600	1286600	When you're getting blamed for everything, just because people...
1286600	1289600	But they don't understand you worked real hard.
1289600	1293600	And you're looking at it going like...
1293600	1296600	I'm trying to...
1296600	1299600	But then the...
1299600	1302600	I'd say you look at those people and you go like, okay, so that's like...
1302600	1305600	You're like off on an ice flow.
1305600	1309600	You're gone. You're doing something that's like...
1309600	1313600	What connection is ever going to happen there?
1313600	1317600	But then you look at other people that are kind of like...
1317600	1325600	I'm not going to riff an example, but I feel like there is a substrata of people
1325600	1334600	that are technically responding to the concept of privilege with a bewildered, logical attack back.
1334600	1343600	Privilege. There's a substrata of them that might be worth engaging just a little bit.
1343600	1348600	That person is a potential ally because that person's bewilderment might actually...
1348600	1353600	It might actually just be based on genuine confusion and logic and...
1353600	1355600	You want him back.
1355600	1357600	Lack of experience. What did you say?
1357600	1358600	You want him back.
1358600	1359600	Oh, yeah. He's great.
1359600	1361600	It's Black Dave from Community.
1361600	1363600	No, I know. Darsan.
1363600	1365600	Anyways, whatever.
1365600	1369600	Can you try to riff an example? I'm not totally sure I know what you're talking about.
1369600	1371600	No, I honestly can't. I really can't.
1371600	1376600	It wasn't like I saw one thing and I was like, oh, I'm identifying that.
1376600	1381600	I was looking at this oil and water and is there something in between.
1381600	1389600	When a hashtag like white privilege starts trending, you know that it's going to be a bug zapper
1389600	1397600	for beautiful creatures and also horrible disgusting ones.
1397600	1401600	It's just going to attract.
1401600	1404600	I was just trying to identify a kind of like...
1404600	1411600	There was the proper use of it and then there was all these different bubbles coming off.
1411600	1415600	I was trying to identify them and I was wondering, are we going to keep...
1415600	1419600	I read an essay in I think New York Times.
1419600	1426600	There was a guy who wrote a thing. I think the headline was A Week From Hell.
1426600	1428600	There's just some...
1428600	1431600	The theme of that just being like...
1431600	1438600	I was kind of talking about this the previous episode before it became extra topical.
1438600	1445600	But the idea of like, is this shit going to hit a point where we actually start to...
1445600	1448600	It actually becomes like just...
1448600	1453600	We have to deal with it in a sense that it's like smart people actually start like...
1453600	1457600	Actually going like, okay, we have to learn to deal with dumb people.
1457600	1460600	It's not...
1460600	1464600	You don't deal with them by going like, you're so dumb.
1464600	1470600	You stick your finger into that wall of jello that is dumb people.
1470600	1475600	Your quarter of your identity is now inside dumb people.
1475600	1482600	You're trying to prove that they're dumb and it's like you make yourself dumb by trying to prove that.
1482600	1484600	A genuine elitist...
1484600	1490600	Their worst nightmare is that there's a new world order forming around them because some people think they know better than them.
1491600	1496600	Sometimes maybe split the diff and go like, what if we were better than them?
1496600	1503600	The answer is if you genuinely felt that way, I think you'd find yourself treating them politely.
1503600	1505600	You might be a redneck.
1505600	1515600	Because I don't imagine that guys in lab coats when they're trying to figure out if deodorant gives you farts for some corporation and they have to kill 10,000 rats to do it.
1515600	1522600	I don't think they'd walk up to each cage, pull the rat out, and go like, you piece of shit! You fucker, don't look at me!
1522600	1530600	I think they go, nice baby, baby, pooty, pooty, and they fucking run them over a deli slicer.
1530600	1532600	Because I think that they're...
1532600	1536600	Because they're like, well, there's no point to engaging this motherfucker.
1536600	1540600	So if you feel that way about ignorant people, you know, like it might...
1540600	1547600	The evolution might be that we start to go, wait, they're actually beyond hope. They don't think for themselves.
1547600	1553600	Like, no real point in pointing your finger in their face and spinning at them because they're...
1553600	1565600	You have intellectual people on both sides of the spectrum of politics, to the far extremes of politics that are quite intelligent people who believe completely antithetical things to each other.
1565600	1577600	Like, who's to say which is right? And also, the people that fall in the middle, these mice that you want to run through a deli slicer, they're just being pulled in two completely different directions by a bunch of intellectual weirdos.
1577600	1580600	Like, who's right and who's wrong on that side?
1580600	1594600	I've talked to people that, you know, you and I both hate politics, I think, by and large, but I've talked to really smart conservatives, really, really intellectual people who believe things that I just can't really dig at all.
1594600	1599600	But they've thought about it, they've given a lot of thought, and they're compassionate people and smart people.
1599600	1610600	Like, I just don't understand. It's talking to somebody who's just a Trump supporter, it's like, they're smart people that are Trump supporters.
1610600	1612600	I can't believe that.
1612600	1620600	There are. There fucking are. There really are. Because they're going to vote for the person that's going to vote and run against Hillary, and they've given it a lot of great thought.
1621600	1624600	I think a lot of people wish they had another candidate. I think on both sides.
1624600	1627600	It's always the lesser of two equals.
1627600	1629600	Yeah, but that's a horrible thing, isn't it?
1629600	1630600	Yeah, awful.
1630600	1632600	It's the worst thing in the world. I think it's a sad admission that...
1632600	1649600	But this word's smart, though. You're talking about, what you're saying, there's people who are Trump supporters who are so smart that they see the benefit in a long-term weird Illuminati game of having a crazy, orange Nazi be president.
1650600	1658600	Or a zen philosophy where, well, if the pillars crumble, then there will be more floor space.
1658600	1663600	I've talked to very smart, thoughtful, compassionate people who believe things that are weirder than Trump.
1663600	1668600	People have their own ideologies based on all sorts of different things.
1668600	1678600	Yeah, but I support people who say, I believe the world is still flat. I believe that we never landed on the moon. I think Bigfoot's out there, all that stuff.
1678600	1686600	I wouldn't bully those people and go, yeah, because I don't believe that those beliefs come from dishonesty.
1686600	1703600	But I don't think that if a political candidate is standing in front of a podium and saying a sentence that you would never say at a cocktail party, ever, in any form, no matter what strategy of a cocktail party we're at, or any social environment, any environment really other than behind a podium.
1704600	1711600	It's some weird, strange statement about the state of the world, and then everyone applauds, and it's all this stuff.
1711600	1718600	There's a certain level where you're like, that's not a philosophy. This is a person in an act of sedition.
1718600	1734600	This is a person who's trying to take advantage of ignorance and vulnerability and fear. They're just rolling into it like a low, liquidy, primal, viscous infection.
1734600	1740600	I think both sides are actively trying to seduce ignorance equally.
1740600	1751600	For sure. I'm definitely not doing no tap dance for no alternative to Donald Trump. I'll bore the hell out of you with why you won't walk away from me knowing who to vote for.
1751600	1761600	Intellectualism is out the window, because proper intellectual discourse is not even allowed. It's just not a thing.
1761600	1788600	I may have used self-defeating language when I was talking about smart people. What if we were to say, for instance, though, that the smarter you get, the less you want other people to die.
1788600	1804600	Now you're conjuring an image of a guy that's a genius, so he took over the railroads, and then he got a monopoly over the newspapers, and he owns Zagnut, and he's sitting at a fucking roundhouse dying of weird cancer that you can only get by using Vietnamese for human chess.
1804600	1818600	What I mean is, forget about what we know about what happens to smart people, or active people, or ambitious people, and just wipe that board clean and think as primates.
1818600	1847600	I'm going to pitch this, and prove me wrong, but that any worldview would definitely accept that.
1847600	1864600	If you accept the need for horrible things, like the higher, the closer to fucking crazy cosmic objectivity you get, I think the more and more you'll become kind of what could be called from a distance a nihilist.
1864600	1880600	But don't you think that's accepting, that's saying, ugh, the cosmos is a bitch, people live and people die, it's fucked up, good things don't happen to good people, etc.
1880600	1895600	But I'm talking about people whose cosmologies are like, necessitate people dying. Don't you think those people are dumber?
1895600	1901600	I think that a lot of them go to Yale, I think a lot of those people are presidents.
1901600	1909600	I'm sure a lot of them have 300 IQs, but don't you think those people are dumber, don't you call them dumber?
1909600	1917600	Empathy is like a skill, it's like an attribute, it's like a muscle, some people are better than others, and that makes them better in that regard.
1917600	1934600	But empathy is when the concept of someone suffering over here, like you might pick up on it or not, lack of empathy would be, the worst case scenario would be someone drowning over here and you don't think you have to save them.
1934600	1943600	That's like, I'm talking about the people who think that you need to have war, people who think that people need to be killed, basically.
1944600	1953600	What about executives at a tobacco company or something like that?
1953600	1958600	That's what we all do to all of each other.
1958600	1961600	What about Vin Diesel?
1961600	1969600	I was very lucky to go and do a few USO tours, like travel around the desert, perform for troops.
1969600	1974600	And if you perform for the Big Red One, these are kids that are poor kids.
1974600	1981600	They're tip of the spear, first one's in every battle that we've probably ever fought since the very beginning.
1981600	1987600	And if you talk to them about killing, they're all for it, it's like let's go get them, blood and guts, they love it.
1988600	1995600	And then you talk to people that fly billion dollar systems like the B-2 bomber or our big spy plants.
1995600	2005600	These are people that have higher educations and they've read poetry and they know Shakespeare and they've read Voltaire and they know music.
2005600	2009600	To an extent that these other kids probably don't, they've never been exposed to it.
2009600	2013600	Their take on death is very different in my conversations with them.
2014600	2018600	They're not happy about killing people, they don't want to, they hope they never have to.
2018600	2021600	And I think there is an educational divide there.
2021600	2031600	But you can talk to people that are way smarter and way more educated than all of those people and they will also say that death is a necessity or that death is an atrocity no matter what.
2032600	2042600	I'd stop you, go much more provincial and go like yeah, the guys with the bayonets, they don't let them in the fucking airplanes.
2043600	2045600	You just said it.
2046600	2049600	Those guys might have 200 IQs but I'm saying...
2050600	2061600	Those guys that are way richer and smarter and have bigger and more access to education than the guys that fly the bombs, there's these expensive planes around that would rather kill people than the people flying those planes.
2061600	2066600	I talked to a bomber, I was in line at a PX, like the general store at a base, and I said, what do you do?
2066600	2068600	And he goes, I'm a bomber.
2068600	2070600	I said, physically, actually what do you do?
2070600	2072600	And he goes, I'm the guy that bombs.
2072600	2075600	I hit the button, I'm looking through the viewfinder.
2075600	2078600	And I was like, what do you see in the viewfinder?
2078600	2080600	And he goes, I see people running.
2080600	2082600	And he got real bummed out.
2082600	2089600	He literally had a Snickers in his hand and I was like getting the Gatorade or whatever in the morning and I said, who are those people?
2089600	2091600	And he goes, not our targets.
2091600	2092600	I go, who are those people?
2092600	2094600	And he goes, women and children.
2094600	2096600	I go, where are your targets?
2096600	2097600	And he goes, they're underground.
2097600	2100600	I said, do those people that you see in the viewfinder running have a chance?
2100600	2102600	And he goes, no, they're dead.
2102600	2103600	I go, how do you deal with that?
2103600	2106600	And he goes, first of all, you don't.
2107600	2111600	And second, the only thing I can take away is that I'm five miles away when it happens.
2111600	2113600	I go, how do you know if you got your target?
2113600	2115600	And he goes, not my department.
2115600	2121600	And this is a guy who is very, very, very smart because they don't let you fly that thing.
2121600	2130600	So your point is that I'm implying that the smarter you get, the less brainwashed or murderous you get.
2130600	2137600	Your point is that smart people can be fucking drones too.
2137600	2141600	So I guess if we're both right, maybe we need to measure.
2141600	2144600	Like, look, my point is there's...
2144600	2146600	I think if you have a compassion, that's all that Spencer said.
2146600	2148600	You can measure people besides something.
2148600	2153600	You can pick any variable you want to sort a list of eight billion people.
2153600	2159600	And the columns that we create on that list, there might be some that we haven't invented yet.
2159600	2161600	There's still data there.
2161600	2168600	We know that you can sort eight billion people by age, gender, race, income, nation, city,
2168600	2173600	people who have experienced violence, people who haven't.
2173600	2176600	There's all these columns.
2176600	2179600	But what if there's a column that we haven't sorted people by yet?
2179600	2188600	What if no IQ test or anything has been able to detect a class of people, a strata of people,
2188600	2195600	who continually get frustrated by the world around them because nobody else seems to get it
2195600	2200600	and we're calling to each other through the jello of the internet and going,
2200600	2203600	does anybody else understand what's going on here?
2203600	2208600	Isn't it easy enough to just understand that if you hurt somebody that's worse than if you don't,
2208600	2211600	and we can have all these conversations about when that's necessary later,
2211600	2215600	those can all be built on that machine language instead of...
2215600	2217600	We're seeing that right now.
2217600	2219600	We're seeing these eruptions.
2219600	2224600	And then we're also seeing these wails of frustration that are the most distressing
2224600	2232600	because it's watching intelligent people, people who are not typically reactionary,
2233600	2244600	people who yesterday were able to see more variance and chaos and have it be part of their life
2244600	2249600	being forced into a dumb fucking cereal box contest.
2249600	2252600	That's the tragedy.
2252600	2257600	Every time something huge happens, the pit of your stomach goes like,
2257600	2261600	oh, these fucking morons, they're not going to handle this well.
2261600	2265600	And that's not going to make any of us any smarter either.
2265600	2271600	Man, if we could get a break from all this shit that makes everybody react all the time.
2271600	2277600	It's like living on a planet with seven billion fucking dogs that don't like fireworks.
2277600	2282600	And sometimes you see another human across the room and it's just like...
2282600	2283600	What was the words, Pastor?
2283600	2284600	I'm sorry, man.
2284600	2286600	Was it sympathy or compassion? What did you say?
2286600	2287600	Empathy.
2287600	2290600	Empathy. I think that's what it is.
2290600	2297600	Listen, as soon as I hear those words, those become problematic
2297600	2301600	because Steve Silberman was up here talking about neurodiversity.
2301600	2308600	The truth is there's a huge spinal cord going through the history of modern humans.
2308600	2316600	The spinal cord is this hugely functional, not typically screaming empathy
2316600	2323600	sub-community of people who needed the technology that they created around them
2323600	2328600	that we all now use to reduce our empathy and do fucked up shit.
2328600	2335600	But they created it because they profited from it in a way that they couldn't on a playground.
2335600	2339600	Having people hit them with sticks because they didn't know how to say the right things.
2339600	2348600	Empathy isn't... When people don't appear to feel things, sometimes those people are thinking.
2348600	2355600	It's when you see smart people get drawn into these fucking mud fights in comment sections
2355600	2359600	and you can tell that they're a chemistry teacher or something
2359600	2363600	and it's like, why do you have opinions about this shit? You're smart.
2364600	2371600	Part of the reason is because those people think that as far as interacting with people,
2371600	2374600	they're supposed to do it through different channels.
2374600	2383600	Anyways, I think my point is we have to figure out how to tell the morons from the non-morons
2383600	2390600	and we have to actually be racist about detecting morons and go, that's the only actual dichotomy.
2391600	2397600	Let's be xenophobic about the morons to the point where we infantilize them as we did.
2397600	2400600	Isn't that what Joseph Goebbels was saying too?
2400600	2407600	Yes, it's a strategy you use when you want to overpower and use a population
2407600	2412600	instead of informing them and engaging them. Yes, that's what I'm advocating.
2412600	2416600	I'm saying fight fire with fire.
2416600	2421600	I'm saying we have to identify our, quote-unquote, race.
2421600	2426600	We have to identify our color and it's not going to be a yellow Pokemon.
2426600	2434600	Actually, bringing up the Neurotribe thing is very interesting because people empathize differently
2434600	2440600	and their connection with other human beings is very different than what I think it ought to be or what mine is.
2440600	2443600	Everybody has different amounts of eye contact they want to make with you.
2443600	2446600	Everybody sounds different when they're nervous.
2446600	2450600	Everybody reacts to cockiness and insecurity differently.
2450600	2456600	It's a mishmash of some house they grew up in, some block they grew up on,
2456600	2463600	and a huge, giant number eight scoop of fucking uncontrollable genetics
2463600	2467600	that are so much less controllable than we'd ever love to think.
2467600	2477600	Until you get somebody to actually say, I don't like you, don't assume they don't like you,
2477600	2481600	we need to move forward into a culture where there's like checks and balances there
2481600	2485600	where you can go like, oh man, there's so much shit happening.
2485600	2489600	We project onto people. We go like, oh, these fucking assholes.
2489600	2493600	When you read one of these comments under one of these things,
2493600	2498600	you stick like a scalpel into that fucking owl pellet and pry it apart
2498600	2501600	and breathe any air into it or any liquid.
2501600	2506600	It turns into a fucking crazy, weird, triple squirrel.
2506600	2509600	It's like this history of what this owl ate.
2509600	2512600	It's like a fucking, what the fuck is this?
2512600	2516600	What expertise are you bringing to bear here?
2516600	2522600	How is anybody not being that honest about what they're actually feeling and what they're fearing?
2522600	2528600	They're so close to just saying they're afraid, but it comes out, it completely inverted.
2528600	2534600	The way that we say, I'm afraid of you is, I am not afraid of you
2534600	2540600	and you would like me to be afraid of you, but I can beat you up, so fuck you.
2540600	2545600	We say everything, but I'm afraid of you, which is just like...
2545600	2550600	If you could isolate all these morons, what would you say to them and what would you do with them?
2550600	2556600	I don't know, fucking Jeff, right now I would walk out, close the freezer door
2556600	2560600	and flip a fucking jigsaw switch that queued a video of me going,
2560600	2567600	85% of America, you don't know me, but I certainly know you.
2567600	2573600	For years you have fucking thought things, typed things.
2573600	2577600	Every time you saw a blinking cursor, you thought it meant you had something to say.
2577600	2581600	There's a jar of acid in one corner, there's a fucking bomb in the other.
2581600	2584600	You have no choice, you're dead, bye.
2584600	2591600	That's the mood I'm in when shit gets to the point when it red lines.
2591600	2595600	I go super villainous, I go like, let's fucking kill everybody.
2595600	2597600	That's not a good response.
2597600	2601600	As a creator and as an artist, let's say you're a painter.
2602600	2606600	Humans have learned to deal with suffering through...
2606600	2610600	The one thing I think that we've created that the other animals haven't is art,
2610600	2613600	to deal with how fucked up things are.
2613600	2617600	What can you do as an artist to assuage that?
2617600	2619600	Anything?
2619600	2621600	Harmon Quest on CISO.
2624600	2627600	Coming to you this Thursday, all episodes...
2627600	2630600	Yeah, July 14th at the... what's it called, theater?
2630600	2632600	Oh, they think that's July 12th, actually.
2632600	2633600	Oh, is it?
2633600	2634600	Yeah, come to the premiere.
2634600	2635600	It's at Ticketmaster.
2635600	2637600	No, maybe it's not.
2637600	2638600	It's not, actually.
2638600	2641600	It's somewhere on the internet.
2642600	2644600	No, it's on the internet.
2644600	2647600	We're all gonna meet up on the internet.
2647600	2650600	But most importantly of all,
2650600	2652600	San Diego Comic Con show.
2652600	2653600	You gotta come there.
2653600	2654600	At the Balboa Theater.
2654600	2655600	That's on Ticketmaster.
2655600	2656600	There you go.
2656600	2657600	What night is that, Steve?
2657600	2658600	22nd.
2659600	2661600	July 22nd at the Balboa Theater.
2661600	2664600	Is it taping and streaming, Steve, the Comic Con show?
2664600	2665600	What's that?
2665600	2666600	Is it taping and streaming?
2666600	2667600	Yeah.
2667600	2669600	Don't we have some of One Direction?
2669600	2670600	Who's coming?
2670600	2671600	We have huge guests.
2671600	2672600	It's not One Direction.
2672600	2673600	It's Zane.
2673600	2674600	We just have Zane?
2674600	2675600	Yeah.
2675600	2676600	Oh, we're fucked.
2676600	2678600	But I think he's gonna be doing a double appearance
2678600	2680600	with Adam Levine.
2680600	2681600	Is that a person?
2681600	2682600	Levine.
2682600	2683600	Yeah, I call him Levine.
2683600	2685600	We go way back.
2685600	2688600	Before he tried to, like, pronounce it all cool and stuff.
2688600	2691600	He was just Levine.
2691600	2692600	Yeah.
2692600	2695600	Yeah, I will...
2695600	2698600	Well, I was gonna say, I'll write...
2698600	2700600	I'll write...
2700600	2701600	As people are seating,
2701600	2703600	as soon as they open the house,
2703600	2704600	I'll have a laptop open.
2704600	2706600	I don't know about this.
2708600	2710600	Sorry, Eugene.
2710600	2712600	And I'll write...
2712600	2713600	That's for one person.
2713600	2714600	But it's not really gonna...
2714600	2716600	It's not gonna draw people to...
2716600	2719600	Well, you're gonna write things that were visibly up on the screen
2719600	2722600	and you're writing the community movie live.
2722600	2724600	Well, I was trying to think of an equivalent.
2724600	2726600	Something I could write so people could watch me write.
2726600	2728600	But it's not gonna lure them in because they're like,
2728600	2731600	well, I could certainly have anything interesting happen to watch that on YouTube.
2731600	2734600	What if you write the next Jaws?
2734600	2736600	But it doesn't matter because it's not...
2736600	2740600	You have to think of a thing that they can only see if they come there.
2740600	2741600	Right.
2742600	2748600	That's why a human guest would be the best.
2748600	2749600	Weren't we gonna get the guy from Hamilton?
2749600	2750600	What happened to him?
2750600	2752600	Oh, no, he's coming.
2752600	2753600	Yeah.
2753600	2754600	He's gonna beat up the show?
2754600	2757600	Yeah, Adam Levine dropped out.
2757600	2759600	So we got Lin.
2759600	2760600	Did we get...
2760600	2761600	It'll be great.
2761600	2762600	Okay.
2762600	2765600	We also got Bulbasaur.
2765600	2768600	He'll be making an appearance.
2768600	2770600	Yeah, yeah.
2770600	2773600	We have all the Jugolos.
2773600	2774600	They're all coming.
2774600	2775600	Yeah.
2775600	2776600	All right.
2776600	2777600	Here's my new segment.
2777600	2780600	Now that the season's over, Game of Thrones questions.
2780600	2782600	Game of Thrones questions.
2782600	2783600	Uh-oh.
2786600	2788600	Now we have to stop this thing.
2788600	2789600	All right.
2789600	2790600	Sorry.
2790600	2791600	All right.
2791600	2792600	Okay.
2792600	2793600	Game of Thrones questions.
2793600	2796600	So remember when Arya Stark...
2796600	2797600	Spoilers.
2797600	2799600	Oh, boy.
2799600	2800600	She was like in the...
2800600	2801600	That plot.
2801600	2804600	In the end, the red wedding coordinator.
2804600	2806600	The guy who loved the red wedding is like,
2806600	2808600	I love red weddings.
2808600	2809600	You don't have to...
2809600	2810600	I don't...
2810600	2811600	I mean, I'm not gonna remember his name.
2811600	2814600	I was more entertained by my own...
2814600	2817600	You have to say that wedding coordinator out of a job.
2817600	2818600	Yeah.
2818600	2819600	I don't know.
2819600	2820600	I don't know.
2820600	2822600	I think he said to her, I want some seeing a red wedding.
2822600	2824600	He was like, I love red wings.
2824600	2827600	So they teed up the Hooters waitress,
2827600	2829600	like this foxy...
2829600	2831600	I put her in her early 20s,
2831600	2838600	like a kind of lady who brings things to Walter Frey.
2838600	2840600	He's the Lord of River Run.
2840600	2842600	And she's bringing him pie and turns out...
2842600	2843600	So there's a scene where he goes,
2843600	2845600	I had more milkshakes.
2845600	2846600	And she comes up and she's like,
2846600	2848600	here's your Game of Thrones milkshakes.
2848600	2850600	And she's like cleavage.
2850600	2856600	And she's a grown woman, but she's certainly not...
2857600	2859600	She's in age inappropriate for him.
2859600	2861600	And he's like, I love milkshakes.
2861600	2864600	And so you see her and you go like, huh, that was weird.
2864600	2867600	And then at the end, she comes back and goes like,
2867600	2868600	would you like another milkshake?
2868600	2871600	And he's like, as long as it reminds me of the red wedding.
2871600	2872600	I love red weddings.
2872600	2877600	And then that Hooters waitress inexplicably like stabs him.
2877600	2880600	And he's like, what are you doing?
2880600	2881600	I didn't ask to be stabbed.
2881600	2884600	And then she pulls off and it's Arya Stark.
2884600	2885600	And you're like, okay.
2885600	2888600	So then the episode's over and I'm going, okay.
2888600	2892600	So I asked a bunch of questions that creep people out
2892600	2897600	about she's 14 and she's disguised as a 19 year old.
2897600	2900600	But I get past that stuff eventually.
2900600	2904600	And I get to the point where I'm asking, have we seen a...
2904600	2907600	So let's say you were a...
2907600	2912600	Arya Stark were a male character that had gone through...
2913600	2915600	When she's being one of the many faced people
2915600	2916600	she's putting on a disguise.
2916600	2917600	But then she disguises herself.
2917600	2918600	Have we seen a...
2918600	2922600	Has there been a cross gender, many faced disguise
2922600	2923600	in Game of Thrones?
2923600	2925600	I think Jockin's done some girls.
2925600	2926600	Say what?
2926600	2927600	Jockin.
2927600	2928600	Jockin.
2928600	2929600	I think he did a girl.
2929600	2930600	Jockin did a girl.
2930600	2931600	Or the girl did him maybe.
2931600	2932600	All right.
2932600	2934600	Jockin did a girl.
2934600	2936600	Yeah, no, there's the penis.
2936600	2938600	It's the penis, yeah.
2938600	2939600	There's a penis.
2939600	2941600	That was your question, right?
2941600	2944600	If a girl puts on a guy mask, there will be a penis.
2944600	2945600	Here's my question.
2945600	2946600	I'm going all the way forward to this.
2946600	2947600	No.
2947600	2951600	So say you were a kid, a boy kid.
2951600	2952600	You go through the train...
2952600	2953600	A grown man penis.
2953600	2954600	What?
2954600	2955600	No.
2955600	2956600	No.
2956600	2957600	I'll stop guessing.
2957600	2958600	No.
2958600	2959600	I'm walking you through this.
2959600	2960600	Let me walk you through it.
2960600	2961600	Okay.
2961600	2962600	You're a boy.
2962600	2963600	You're a young Spencer.
2963600	2964600	Right.
2964600	2965600	You go to the house with the double doors
2965600	2966600	and the black and the white.
2966600	2967600	Yeah, yeah.
2967600	2968600	And the guy says like,
2968600	2969600	stop using pronouns.
2969600	2970600	Right.
2970600	2973600	Don't always speak in the present tense.
2973600	2975600	He gives you the whole orientation.
2975600	2976600	Right.
2976600	2978600	Also, we're going to take your eyes away
2978600	2980600	and hit you with a stick for a while.
2980600	2982600	Only if you use a pronoun.
2982600	2983600	You got to fuck up first.
2983600	2984600	Yeah.
2984600	2986600	And so you go through the whole training
2986600	2988600	and along the way you learn,
2988600	2991600	you find a whole row chamber of faces
2991600	2992600	and you find out you can take them each
2992600	2994600	and you can slap them on and go be that person.
2994600	2995600	Yeah.
2995600	2996600	And then you're like,
2996600	2997600	well, all of them are women.
2997600	3000600	51 percent maybe.
3000600	3002600	So at one point you go,
3002600	3004600	he says, he comes to you and he says,
3004600	3011600	a boy who has no name needs to go over to Seattle
3011600	3016600	and hang out and certain man who started
3016600	3021600	a certain startup thinks the stock options
3021600	3023600	would be appropriate to blah, blah, blah,
3023600	3025600	but maybe the people need the stock to drop down.
3025600	3026600	Right.
3026600	3028600	I'm combining Game of Thrones with Grand Theft Auto 5.
3028600	3029600	Okay.
3029600	3034600	So you go to, so you disguise yourself as a woman.
3034600	3035600	Yeah.
3035600	3037600	So you go there and it's like you're, you know,
3037600	3039600	you're watching him and it's like,
3039600	3041600	you're in disguise for a while.
3041600	3042600	Yeah.
3042600	3045600	So let's say during that disguise, period,
3045600	3047600	you fall in love with him.
3047600	3048600	Mm-hmm.
3048600	3050600	And you make love with him.
3050600	3051600	Yeah.
3051600	3056600	So go even beyond like, so I got my friends to tell me,
3056600	3058600	yes, there'd be a vagina there.
3058600	3059600	Right.
3059600	3060600	It's part of the disguise.
3060600	3061600	It's a mystical disguise.
3061600	3062600	You're assuming that identity.
3062600	3063600	Oh, yeah.
3063600	3064600	Oh, yeah.
3064600	3065600	So his wiener goes into your vagina.
3065600	3066600	Yeah.
3066600	3067600	It would have to.
3067600	3069600	He ejaculates from joy.
3069600	3070600	Of course.
3070600	3073600	Because I'm told is the only, that's the only way it happens.
3073600	3074600	What else?
3074600	3079600	So this illusion is not going to stop there
3079600	3080600	and turn into something else.
3080600	3081600	You've got ovaries.
3081600	3082600	You've got eggs.
3082600	3085600	Let's say you get pregnant.
3085600	3086600	Your disguise gets pregnant.
3086600	3087600	Yeah.
3087600	3088600	How could it not be possible?
3088600	3089600	I mean...
3089600	3090600	Can that happen, Spencer, as a mimic?
3090600	3094600	Would the mimic character have ovaries?
3094600	3095600	Does it go that far?
3095600	3099600	Let me tell you something about illusionary magic.
3099600	3101600	It breaks down into a lot of things.
3101600	3104600	There's glamors, I think, and figments,
3104600	3107600	and then there's lesser phantasms and shadows.
3107600	3109600	You see, there's a whole gamut.
3109600	3113600	But I assume that the masks probably just work on this lowest level
3113600	3118600	where it's just your basic senses, but nothing deeper than that.
3118600	3123600	So you might confuse yourself for grabbing like a hot titty or whatever,
3123600	3126600	but it wouldn't actually be there.
3126600	3130600	It would just be magically your senses were feeling it.
3130600	3133600	You're saying if you...
3134600	3135600	Well, okay.
3135600	3137600	So that means that...
3141600	3145600	If you trained this way, and you're going to...
3145600	3147600	Well, I shouldn't even say you're going to assassinate me.
3147600	3150600	You're going to assassinate someone in Los Angeles,
3150600	3154600	and the best way to do it is to love me.
3154600	3159600	So you meet me, and we hit it off, and you know that I...
3159600	3161600	You're on the right track.
3161600	3164600	You're doing your mission right by loving me.
3164600	3169600	So I make love to you, and you're saying the illusory magic
3169600	3174600	means that when I take my tiny, itty-bitty, little,
3174600	3178600	rage-filled, purple, disgusting penis,
3178600	3185600	and I move it around hoping for some fucking relief
3185600	3188600	that Captain Kangaroo couldn't give me,
3188600	3190600	I finally...
3190600	3196600	When I insert it, what's happening is that my mind...
3196600	3199600	Something's happening, and it's based on illusion,
3199600	3203600	and what you're saying is that definitely you don't have ovaries.
3203600	3204600	I don't think so.
3204600	3206600	Because it's at the point of...
3206600	3210600	You're saying if I grabbed where your breast would be,
3210600	3214600	it's like nano armor where it'd be like,
3214600	3218600	oh, he expects to feel a breast there, so energy goes there.
3218600	3219600	Yeah, that's what I assumed.
3219600	3222600	I assumed it's focused on the face,
3222600	3226600	that channels the magic, but it's illusionary magic.
3226600	3228600	I don't think there's a physical...
3228600	3231600	You're not physically morphing in any way.
3231600	3235600	So if you fell in love with someone who was disguising themselves
3235600	3240600	with illusion magic as the opposite gender,
3240600	3248600	and you imagined yourself consummating a reproductive...
3248600	3249600	A baby.
3249600	3251600	Engagement with them.
3251600	3255600	Yeah, of course it wouldn't...
3255600	3258600	You're saying there's something happening down there
3258600	3261600	that's a cloud of thought around your penis.
3261600	3264600	It's like VR.
3264600	3266600	You don't know.
3266600	3268600	It just seems like you're there.
3268600	3271600	I wanted to go to the place that there's actually...
3271600	3274600	You have to have ovaries if you were...
3274600	3276600	The disguise is thorough,
3276600	3279600	and then a baby could be conceived,
3279600	3281600	but while the disguise was happening,
3281600	3284600	and then my big question was, the baby's born,
3284600	3288600	it's half you, but half...
3288600	3289600	Who?
3289600	3291600	It would be the mask in that case.
3291600	3293600	It would have to be, because it's the mask.
3293600	3295600	I think if your job is to be...
3295600	3297600	If you're gonna be one of the many-faced weirdos
3297600	3300600	to get on a face and go kill somebody,
3300600	3301600	you're not doing your job right
3301600	3304600	if you're going home and fucking people.
3304600	3306600	I think your job is to go kill somebody...
3306600	3308600	You're supposed to go kill somebody
3308600	3311600	and put that face back up on the shelf by sundown?
3311600	3312600	Yeah.
3312600	3313600	Or you lose your eyes.
3313600	3316600	What is the fantasy you're wishing?
3316600	3320600	It seems like you have some sort of pie-in-the-sky version of this
3320600	3323600	where he wants to be pregnant.
3323600	3327600	I wanted to try to chase magic to the threshold of genetics.
3327600	3330600	I just was curious, because that's a case of,
3330600	3333600	you're saying magic is like, oh, I look like so-and-so,
3333600	3335600	and it's just the illusion...
3335600	3336600	I don't know.
3336600	3337600	Just asking questions, man.
3337600	3340600	I want to know about what are the rules on those dragons.
3340600	3341600	You can't control them,
3341600	3343600	and they deposit you in the wilderness,
3343600	3344600	then you knock over some fires,
3344600	3347600	and all of a sudden you're fucking queen dragons all of a sudden?
3347600	3348600	How does that work?
3348600	3350600	You go off-screen for a while,
3350600	3352600	and then all of a sudden you now control dragons perfectly?
3352600	3353600	What the shit is that?
3353600	3354600	Yeah.
3354600	3355600	And you can fly them over a boat,
3355600	3357600	and then you say, like,
3357600	3358600	dukadoor.
3358600	3360600	And then you go like, oh, dukadoor.
3360600	3361600	I like to...
3361600	3362600	Wait a minute.
3362600	3364600	You need words to do shit?
3364600	3366600	You've been fucking autonomous this whole...
3366600	3367600	Also, they needed boats.
3367600	3369600	The first thing the dragons did,
3369600	3370600	they burned down a bunch of boats.
3370600	3375600	Well, they made great pains to burn down only one boat at all,
3375600	3377600	which was really weird visually.
3377600	3380600	It was like three dragons attacking one boat.
3380600	3383600	It was very slow work being done.
3383600	3384600	Warfare's, you know, lies.
3384600	3385600	I did note that too.
3385600	3386600	I was like, oh...
3386600	3387600	Because before that I was experiencing...
3387600	3388600	Because it looks dumb.
3388600	3389600	Because of the joy I was going,
3389600	3392600	oh, all this fucking dragons, and dragons are so goddamn important,
3392600	3394600	and all this stuff, and it's like, wow, they're really showing you.
3394600	3396600	Yes, of course dragons are important.
3396600	3397600	They are...
3397600	3400600	Like, the might of the military is, like,
3400600	3404600	a huge part of it is wooden boats that float up to the thing.
3404600	3406600	And I thought I was going to see a scene
3406600	3409600	where a dragon flew over, like, 90 boats...
3409600	3410600	Exactly.
3410600	3411600	And lit them all up.
3411600	3412600	Right.
3412600	3413600	That would have been really cool looking.
3413600	3414600	But they might have...
3414600	3415600	They might have made...
3415600	3416600	No, I get that.
3416600	3418600	And that's why they made it look stupid.
3418600	3419600	It was just dumb.
3419600	3420600	All right.
3420600	3421600	I don't like it.
3421600	3422600	What?
3422600	3424600	You raised your hand.
3424600	3425600	I did.
3425600	3427600	He's been raising his hand for an hour a day.
3427600	3429600	No, he's been shouting shit out.
3429600	3432600	That's why when he raises his hand I'm like, are we going to die?
3432600	3436600	I have a question about the illusionary magic.
3436600	3437600	So do I.
3437600	3440600	And we finished that segment.
3440600	3443600	What about Philip Morris?
3443600	3444600	What's that?
3444600	3446600	Are they using illusionary magic?
3446600	3447600	Wait.
3447600	3448600	Say what?
3448600	3449600	I didn't hear it.
3449600	3450600	What about Philip Morris?
3450600	3451600	It was a callback.
3451600	3452600	It's fine.
3452600	3453600	I want to answer...
3453600	3455600	No one ever asks me questions about magic.
3455600	3456600	I love this.
3456600	3457600	Well, I have a question for you about magic.
3457600	3458600	Yeah.
3458600	3459600	No, I heard it.
3459600	3464600	Your theory about the illusions works in an additive way, right?
3465600	3471600	So if you have the illusion of a beautiful titty and Dan goes to touch it, the illusion
3471600	3474600	makes him think he's touching a beautiful titty that isn't there.
3474600	3483600	However, if Dan goes to fuck your illusionary vagina, it doesn't really work in a subtractive
3483600	3484600	way.
3484600	3493600	If there's a dick there and Dan goes to fuck a vagina, your theory doesn't really remove
3493600	3494600	the dick.
3494600	3498600	Well, what's actually happened is you're just working your elbow down there and they're
3498600	3500600	just going out the elbow.
3500600	3502600	That's exactly...
3502600	3507600	That was part of what I was thinking, but when you put it in the words that I looked
3507600	3509600	down that road and I was like, wait, is this like in 1986?
3509600	3511600	It's like a link letter movie.
3511600	3514600	Like I'm asking these questions about like fucking and pussies.
3514600	3519600	I backed away from it, but thank you for walking into that minefield and just confirming that
3519600	3520600	it's just like...
3520600	3521600	Just imagine...
3522600	3523600	Because it's like, what?
3523600	3528600	If it's an invisible pussy, how do you know what your dick's in a pussy?
3528600	3531600	I didn't want to...
3531600	3534600	I'm glad you're laughing because I'm like...
3534600	3536600	But I ran that simulation.
3536600	3538600	I was like, I have a 43.
3538600	3539600	It's a new world.
3539600	3543600	I got to ask these questions and then you did...
3543600	3547600	Like we're both alive, which is what the...
3547600	3548600	We're the same.
3548600	3550600	Well, we've all had our fun tonight.
3550600	3553600	But just imagine a hallucination, right?
3553600	3556600	You see something, it's not there.
3556600	3559600	Now imagine that happening, but with your sense of touch.
3559600	3560600	That's all that's happening.
3560600	3563600	It's just a hallucination totally not happening.
3563600	3565600	But somehow your mind just interprets it as happening.
3565600	3566600	Of course.
3566600	3567600	That's all it is.
3567600	3568600	It's magic.
3568600	3571600	You feel the pussy surround your penis.
3574600	3577600	It is wet and tight as you'd imagine.
3578600	3581600	And warm as the microwaved cantaloupe.
3586600	3590600	But deep within your will, something feels amiss.
3593600	3595600	You pass your will save.
3596600	3598600	It's a dude.
3599600	3601600	But that's fine.
3601600	3603600	If you're fine with that.
3604600	3607600	I ask her like, what's going on?
3607600	3608600	What's the deal?
3610600	3611600	They're right here.
3611600	3612600	Stab in the neck.
3613600	3614600	There you go.
3615600	3617600	I don't think it would go that far.
3617600	3622600	What's the will save on imaginary pussies?
3622600	3623600	Seventeen.
3624600	3626600	So he rolled what?
3626600	3627600	He rolled a seventeen or higher?
3627600	3628600	Oh yeah, yeah.
3628600	3629600	He's rolling hard.
3629600	3631600	My point was about genetics.
3632600	3635600	It's about genetics, but I think I have all my answers.
3637600	3642600	Illusion magic can make you in all the ways that you would mythically think you could fool somebody.
3642600	3643600	You can fool somebody.
3643600	3647600	That includes being in bed with them, conjugating with them.
3647600	3648600	None of it.
3648600	3650600	But it's all an illusion.
3650600	3652600	Unless it's not.
3652600	3654600	It could be polymorph magic.
3654600	3656600	I just don't think it is.
3656600	3659600	Oh, in which case it's like actually manipulating the matter.
3659600	3668600	Yeah, but usually like there are, you know, I think in like a lot of old, old like Greek, not Greek, god damn it.
3668600	3670600	Old like knights and legends and stuff.
3670600	3675600	There's all these body switching potions and then you actually would get pregnant with the kids.
3675600	3677600	And that was like, that was probably polymorph magic.
3677600	3684600	All right, well say I'm a, what is the, you can be a halfling magician.
3684600	3686600	Oh boy, can you ever.
3686600	3689600	Okay, so that's a, there's a reduced size there.
3689600	3690600	There's an average height.
3690600	3698600	So if that person's an illusionist and they cast an illusion spell that's supposed to disguise them as somebody, there's limitations based on height.
3698600	3703600	Yeah, the lower level magic spells, you can only go by like about an eighth of your total height.
3703600	3705600	So the shorter you are, you can only get a little bit taller.
3705600	3707600	Those things are all expressed as modifiers.
3707600	3712600	Yeah, modifiers, hit points, saving throws.
3712600	3715600	Yeah, hey, who made that weird groan?
3716600	3718600	Better be your heartburn.
3719600	3720600	I miss D&D you guys.
3720600	3721600	I miss playing the D&D.
3721600	3722600	Yeah.
3724600	3729600	I enjoyed our Shadowrun thing for a little while, but I think we didn't quite really sink our teeth into that.
3729600	3730600	I'll tell you what, maybe if enough people.
3730600	3732600	This place is crawling with Nidoran.
3734600	3739600	So the headlines were, of course I did want to get, so there was the headline about how there's a robbery gang.
3739600	3744600	They set up like a maybe a pokey lure or something and they, so you show up or they're preying on people.
3744600	3753600	The other one, of course, was the, I think a young lady who was searching for a Pokemon into a riverbed and found a dead body.
3753600	3756600	Yeah, and a dude fell off a bridge.
3756600	3759600	Somebody got stabbed in Chicago by a Scyther.
3761600	3763600	Yeah, this is my element.
3765600	3767600	Wait, I'm overwhelmed. You're overwhelming grandpa.
3767600	3769600	Let me, let's hear.
3770600	3772600	No, the guy who plays like a really bad air should come up there.
3772600	3773600	Come up and grab a mic so we can hear you.
3773600	3775600	Get up and grab a mic so we can hear you.
3775600	3776600	Yeah, are you really good at just standing in the mic?
3776600	3777600	Yeah.
3777600	3780600	Because this guy knew, you're, what are you, theater trained?
3780600	3783600	What are you, like, here's my thoughts.
3783600	3784600	Yes.
3784600	3785600	Like, you were good.
3785600	3788600	Yes, this guy up here is playing Pippin in the Torrance Community Center.
3791600	3792600	What's your name?
3792600	3793600	Scott Ian from Anthrax.
3794600	3796600	Actually, I like that. I like Anthrax.
3796600	3798600	Yeah, if I thought that would be insulting, I wouldn't have said that.
3798600	3801600	No, but you look a little bit like Scott Ian.
3801600	3802600	I like that.
3802600	3803600	Yeah.
3803600	3804600	My name's Jacob.
3804600	3807600	No, the story I was saying was, I read this, God, it was like two days ago when this came out.
3807600	3810600	Some kid in Chicago, I think it was like a seven-year-old or something,
3810600	3812600	was playing Pokemon Go, you know, on the app.
3812600	3814600	Didn't fucking look where he was going.
3814600	3816600	One is a really bad area of town.
3816600	3819600	He gets, like, passed by this convenience store or something.
3819600	3821600	Somebody actually stabs him and just robs him.
3821600	3823600	I think he survived, but...
3823600	3825600	Team Rocket? Team Rocket.
3826600	3828600	Yeah.
3828600	3829600	Oh, man.
3829600	3831600	Fucking blues. Fucking blues.
3831600	3832600	What?
3832600	3834600	This is not for grandpa.
3834600	3836600	Oh, yeah.
3836600	3839600	If a blue walks in, I'll stab him.
3839600	3840600	I'll stab him.
3840600	3841600	Oh, God.
3841600	3843600	No, but this really happened.
3843600	3845600	I'm terrified right now.
3845600	3850600	He was stabbed by people unrelated to Pokemon Go or people that were part of the game.
3850600	3852600	No, it was unrelated. It was a robbery.
3852600	3854600	He just didn't realize that you weren't in a bad area.
3854600	3856600	He walked into a bad part of town.
3856600	3857600	Yes.
3857600	3860600	And he got stabbed for being in the bad part of town.
3860600	3861600	Pretty much, yes.
3861600	3866600	So Pokemon Go, because it's the first game to require leaving your house,
3866600	3869600	is being fused with all the reasons to not leave your house.
3869600	3870600	Pretty much, yes.
3870600	3872600	It's Pokemon Go stories.
3872600	3877600	The Pokemon Go user meets a dude that wastes five years of her life.
3877600	3886600	I don't know what that was. I don't know what that was.
3886600	3892600	I downloaded the game with Dan and Cody a few hours ago.
3892600	3896600	Went home, took a shower, got dressed, turned my phone on.
3896600	3897600	That app is still open.
3897600	3901600	And there was Pokemon lurking about my crib.
3901600	3902600	So I threw some Pokeballs at him.
3902600	3905600	And it took a while to figure out how that shit works.
3905600	3908600	Because it's not intuitive. I'll tell you that much.
3908600	3911600	It seems like skeeball, but mostly it's a fucking shot in the dark.
3911600	3912600	It is.
3912600	3913600	And then...
3913600	3914600	You're right.
3914600	3915600	So I start looking around.
3915600	3916600	Also, they don't let you wear a suit and tie.
3916600	3919600	You gotta have a yellow backpack on and a visor.
3919600	3920600	Like I'm a golfer.
3920600	3921600	Oh, Jeff is so affected by that.
3921600	3922600	I don't like this shit.
3922600	3926600	You're making Jeff play a game where he has to choose between three kinds of visor.
3926600	3927600	I don't like...
3927600	3929600	It took a while to die, basically.
3929600	3931600	I'm not like one of those freemium players where like,
3931600	3935600	oh, oh, 1999 to get a big energy pack to do this thing?
3935600	3937600	Fuck that. I'll play it for free.
3937600	3939600	I'll spend my money on fun things.
3939600	3940600	Yeah, have a seat.
3940600	3945600	But I'll tell you right now, if Pokemon Go had a $5 thing that let me put a suit on,
3945600	3946600	I'll fucking do it.
3946600	3948600	So anyway, I look around.
3948600	3952600	What the little Pokemons might be around town.
3952600	3960600	One's Marshall High School, and one is the Immaculate Heart convent right up my street.
3960600	3962600	Katy Perry just bought that shit.
3962600	3966600	So maybe I go up there and my Pokemon is Katy Perry.
3966600	3968600	But it's making me walk around my neighborhood.
3968600	3972600	But how do I know that Mark Maron's not waiting there to kill me
3972600	3974600	so he can kill Harmontown guys?
3974600	3980600	Yeah, if you guys don't think fucking Maron's gonna use this as a way to try to get his edge back over us.
3980600	3981600	Like luring.
3981600	3982600	There's a...
3982600	3984600	Do you think we have an edge on Mark Maron right now?
3984600	3987600	No, it was a bit.
3987600	3989600	Teens use Pokemon Go apps.
3989600	3991600	You found a dead body.
3991600	3993600	Okay, talked about...
3993600	3995600	Armed robbery in Missouri happened.
3995600	3998600	What about the guy fell off a bridge, died?
3998600	4000600	Wait, are we talking about just current events or...
4000600	4001600	No, no, no.
4001600	4002600	These are Pokemon related.
4002600	4003600	Yeah, yeah.
4003600	4004600	Okay, well...
4004600	4007600	Did you guys hear that Donald Trump is running for president?
4007600	4008600	Really?
4008600	4009600	Holy shit.
4009600	4015600	Yeah, he followed a Pokemon into the Republican committee.
4015600	4016600	It's amazing.
4016600	4018600	We can get back to any of this, but I just...
4018600	4020600	There's only a couple things more to get out of the pipe.
4020600	4022600	I just wanted to say that...
4022600	4027600	I don't know if you guys knew this, but I looked it up because I've been trying to watch all of the Saw movies.
4027600	4028600	What's your name?
4028600	4029600	Jacob.
4029600	4030600	Jacob.
4030600	4032600	I've been trying to watch all the Saw movies again.
4032600	4034600	I forgot the...
4034600	4037600	There were four of them when I did it the first time, so I'm up to four.
4037600	4040600	I just finished Saw 4 and very confused.
4040600	4043600	But just so you know, if you watch all the Saw movies, you get to four.
4043600	4044600	It gets very confusing.
4044600	4046600	It's just going to save you some trouble.
4046600	4049600	The Saw 4 happens at the same time as Saw 3.
4049600	4050600	All right.
4050600	4051600	Yeah.
4051600	4055600	Just watch them and just save yourself some trouble.
4055600	4056600	It's not a spoiler.
4056600	4058600	I don't know why they did it that way.
4058600	4060600	I think because Saw dies...
4060600	4062600	The guy's name is Saw?
4062600	4068600	I don't want to spoil this for you guys, but there's 90 of these movies and Saw dies in...
4068600	4070600	Well, he starts dying in the first one.
4070600	4072600	That's the whole point, is that he's dying.
4072600	4074600	That's why he's Saw.
4074600	4079600	And then the second one, he's like, I'm really dying, so I'm sawing everything.
4079600	4081600	And then the third one, it's like, remember?
4081600	4084600	There's one girl that I sawed in the first one and the second one.
4084600	4086600	Now she's like my sidekick.
4086600	4087600	This is a spoiler.
4087600	4088600	She's my protege.
4088600	4089600	No, it's not.
4089600	4096600	It's a spoiler of fucking crazy telenovela that has almost nothing to do with Saw's
4096600	4101600	and everything to do with the weirdly incompatible themes
4101600	4104600	of puzzles...
4104600	4106600	And living.
4106600	4107600	Joy?
4107600	4113600	And civil engineering.
4113600	4115600	The killer is a...
4115600	4117600	He's an engineer.
4117600	4118600	He loves...
4118600	4119600	He makes things.
4119600	4121600	And then at one point he wanted...
4121600	4122600	So he saws people.
4122600	4124600	So Saw 3 and 4 happen at the same time.
4124600	4126600	So...
4126600	4127600	Don't get confused.
4127600	4130600	Because there's a guy that walks into the end of Saw 4,
4130600	4132600	and he's actually watching the end of Saw 3.
4132600	4134600	All right.
4134600	4141600	Hey, have you guys ever seen a guy wear a hard hat into a bar and would just wear it?
4141600	4143600	Like he's just wearing a hat?
4143600	4145600	Because I did.
4145600	4149600	And he's out there somewhere and it said Time Warner on his hat.
4149600	4151600	There was a guy with a hard hat.
4151600	4153600	A guy with a hard hat walks into a bar.
4153600	4155600	He's just wearing a hard hat.
4155600	4158600	All right.
4159600	4162600	So you guys think that's okay to wear a hard hat?
4162600	4164600	Just...
4164600	4165600	They love it.
4165600	4169600	I think in this day and age it's the only safe way to walk into a bar.
4169600	4170600	Okay.
4170600	4172600	I think he was too cool looking.
4172600	4174600	He was too hip looking.
4174600	4177600	And he knew that he's a white collar guy.
4177600	4179600	But he wouldn't read that way in the bar.
4179600	4181600	So he was like, I'll just wear my hat.
4181600	4182600	You know?
4182600	4183600	It's me.
4183600	4184600	It's who I am.
4184600	4185600	It shows what I am.
4185600	4186600	I'm not ashamed of it.
4186600	4188600	The hard hat to me says I'm on the clock.
4188600	4190600	But going into the bar says I'm off the clock.
4190600	4193600	You don't get to do both of those.
4193600	4199600	If you've ever worn a hard hat, you want to take it off all the time.
4199600	4200600	Yeah, they're not comfortable.
4200600	4203600	It's like balancing a suitcase on your head.
4203600	4206600	Maybe he had a head injury and he needs to wear the hard hat.
4206600	4208600	Yeah, he could be the best person ever.
4208600	4213600	And I thought that the whole time while I was asking questions about him.
4213600	4215600	I was like, this guy's the hero and I'm the villain.
4215600	4216600	What am I doing?
4216600	4218600	Why isn't he allowed to dress the way he wants to dress?
4218600	4220600	It's a hard hat.
4220600	4221600	It's just weird.
4221600	4223600	He was acting like it wasn't a hard hat.
4223600	4225600	Where was that?
4225600	4226600	The drawing room.
4226600	4227600	Oh, yeah.
4227600	4233600	That place is crawling with Nidoran.
4233600	4234600	I don't even know what you're talking about.
4234600	4236600	I love it so much.
4236600	4238600	I was in bed with my girlfriend.
4238600	4240600	I swear to God.
4240600	4241600	Hear him out.
4241600	4244600	Suspend your disbelief.
4244600	4246600	And we were having a nice weekend.
4246600	4247600	Jacob, this is why I kept you up here.
4247600	4249600	I want you to hear this.
4249600	4250600	Okay.
4250600	4254600	Jacob, what he's saying is he wants you to come home with him and his girlfriend.
4254600	4257600	Okay.
4257600	4258600	And my...
4258600	4261600	And sing some anthrax for us.
4261600	4268600	And my girlfriend said to me, I want to start getting you to like light more.
4268600	4269600	Oh, yeah.
4269600	4270600	Light.
4270600	4271600	Yeah.
4271600	4272600	Like light hurts you, right?
4272600	4273600	Because I don't like light.
4273600	4274600	Yeah.
4274600	4275600	Like it makes you uncomfortable.
4275600	4276600	Yeah.
4276600	4277600	I don't like sunlight.
4277600	4278600	Are you photosensitive?
4278600	4279600	Are you photosensitive?
4279600	4281600	I don't know.
4281600	4282600	I don't like light.
4282600	4283600	Yeah.
4283600	4284600	Sensitive.
4284600	4285600	I don't know.
4285600	4286600	Don't like it.
4286600	4287600	I don't like light.
4287600	4289600	How do you feel about this limelight?
4289600	4290600	The stage?
4290600	4293600	The necessary evil.
4293600	4296600	If you had your way, would the stage be totally dark?
4296600	4297600	Whoa.
4297600	4301600	That would be a real podcast.
4302600	4303600	Yeah.
4303600	4304600	Let's see what would happen.
4304600	4305600	Yeah.
4305600	4306600	Bring the lights down.
4306600	4309600	Let's podcast this shit for the live audience.
4309600	4312600	The poor fuckers have paid $5 to watch it.
4312600	4313600	Well, no.
4313600	4315600	But they probably feel like a little bit of relief too.
4315600	4316600	Oh, they'd love that.
4316600	4317600	Total darkness.
4317600	4318600	Can we take the house lights all the way out?
4318600	4319600	Just take them down.
4319600	4320600	Give us as much as possible.
4320600	4321600	Everything.
4321600	4324600	How low can we go lighting wise?
4324600	4327600	And nobody has like a cosmic sound cue.
4327600	4328600	Oh.
4328600	4329600	Meeting me.
4329600	4330600	But wait.
4330600	4331600	Just let it be silent.
4331600	4334600	I mean, unless anyone had an actual...
4334600	4335600	That's...
4335600	4336600	It's...
4336600	4337600	You can't...
4337600	4338600	Okay.
4338600	4339600	That's good.
4339600	4340600	All right.
4340600	4341600	You want a cosmic sound cue?
4341600	4342600	Oh, man.
4342600	4345600	This place is crawling with Nidoran.
4345600	4350600	They come out in the dark.
4350600	4354600	How many more times do you think I could do that tonight?
4359600	4366600	I want you to go with me across the cosmos.
4366600	4370600	Leave your body behind.
4370600	4372600	You stupid.
4372600	4374600	You stupid.
4374600	4377600	You stupid.
4377600	4380600	You stupid.
4380600	4382600	You stupid.
4382600	4383600	You stupid.
4383600	4386600	As you float up to the stratosphere.
4386600	4388600	Because worse.
4388600	4392600	The closer you get, it gets worse.
4392600	4394600	As you float up to the stars.
4394600	4396600	Worse.
4396600	4398600	The closer you get, it gets worse.
4398600	4400600	And you find out.
4400600	4402600	Your identity.
4402600	4404600	Before you reach out.
4404600	4408600	The moral in you has struck you now.
4408600	4409600	What?
4409600	4414600	Have an exit plan.
4414600	4419600	As you continue outside of the blue marble called the Earth.
4419600	4425600	It becomes increasingly insignificant.
4425600	4427600	Beneath you.
4427600	4431600	And you see a planet in the side of your eye.
4431600	4435600	You go toward it.
4435600	4442600	It seems small at first, but as you approach, it gets medium sized.
4442600	4449600	Finally, larger still, until it is as big as a thing you've ever seen.
4449600	4460600	You land on this dirt-covered desert-like planet.
4460600	4471600	There is only infinity between you and your goal.
4471600	4482600	You have only a leather-bound satchel filled with three inventory items.
4482600	4487600	Your name is Spencer.
4487600	4488600	Oh shit.
4488600	4490600	Oh, I don't have an echo.
4490600	4495600	You shouldn't.
4495600	4498600	I don't either.
4498600	4502600	That makes sense.
4502600	4510600	I don't need you to do anything as I am not I.
4510600	4514600	I am what you would call nothing.
4514600	4526600	However, should you choose to take an action declaring so with specific expressions of
4526600	4535600	when and why will constitute the player turn?
4535600	4548600	I remind you, you are on a red dusty planet with a satchel with three items.
4548600	4551600	Spencer.
4551600	4553600	That would be great if I left.
4553600	4557600	Oh, now I do have an echo.
4557600	4558600	Oh shit.
4558600	4560600	What are the items, though?
4560600	4561600	Are we going to die?
4561600	4565600	Are you asking if you'd like to look into the satchel?
4565600	4568600	Well, don't I know what's in them already?
4568600	4577600	When you search back in your mind for the answer to questions about what you already know,
4577600	4582600	you find yourself curiously shortcoming.
4582600	4584600	So what's in the satchel then?
4584600	4588600	You only know your name is Spencer and that you have a satchel.
4588600	4591600	You feel three bulges from within.
4591600	4595600	Oh shit.
4595600	4598600	I throw them in a hole.
4598600	4603600	Reaching for the three bulges, you throw the satchel in the hole?
4603600	4604600	Oh yeah, yeah.
4604600	4606600	I just toss it in a hole.
4606600	4607600	You throw the hole, satchel?
4607600	4608600	I'm sorry.
4608600	4609600	What did you...
4609600	4614600	Then I'm going to take seven steps backwards and then shit.
4614600	4617600	You did not throw anything?
4617600	4618600	What?
4618600	4619600	You didn't throw it?
4619600	4620600	No, no.
4620600	4621600	I threw it first.
4621600	4622600	You threw the satchel?
4622600	4623600	Yeah, yeah.
4623600	4624600	And then I shit.
4624600	4631600	You throw the satchel in the hole and take...
4631600	4634600	and take seven steps back.
4634600	4635600	Okay.
4635600	4637600	There is a great rumbling.
4637600	4641600	A high-pitched tone turns into chanting.
4641600	4652600	The only word of which you can decipher is viscera, viscera, viscera.
4652600	4653600	I run perpendicular.
4653600	4654600	Sorry, what?
4654600	4656600	I run perpendicular.
4656600	4658600	You run perpendicular.
4658600	4659600	To the viscera.
4659600	4669600	To the viscera as what I was describing continues to happen.
4669600	4670600	Yeah.
4670600	4675600	And a big frog comes out and...
4675600	4676600	Wait, we see viscera.
4676600	4677600	Is it like columns of like...
4677600	4678600	What the fuck?
4678600	4679600	Who's this?
4679600	4680600	What?
4680600	4681600	What?
4681600	4682600	Jesus.
4682600	4683600	Who?
4683600	4684600	Show yourself.
4684600	4685600	Who are you?
4685600	4687600	That's the frog.
4687600	4688600	Frog.
4688600	4691600	Speak or be besmirched.
4691600	4693600	What's up?
4693600	4697600	What's with all that viscera you're finding yourself in and amongst?
4697600	4699600	Seriously, what is with the viscera?
4699600	4702600	It's your viscera, assumedly.
4702600	4714600	I leave you both in a plexiglass cube in universe 232 of...
4744600	4750600	I hope today's opening day will be a day of opening.
4750600	4752600	Hello, are you open?
4752600	4753600	What?
4753600	4754600	I open the door.
4754600	4757600	I'm Armenian.
4757600	4760600	I am God.
4760600	4765600	I own a gift shop for Armenians.
4765600	4768600	I'm looking for some cards from my wife.
4768600	4769600	Come in.
4769600	4770600	Come in.
4770600	4772600	Sorry, hey, I'm the frog you sent back.
4772600	4773600	And you got comics?
4773600	4774600	Jesus.
4774600	4775600	Jesus.
4775600	4776600	What?
4776600	4777600	I give back what he sent me.
4777600	4779600	You're getting viscera all over the place.
4779600	4781600	And not my fault.
4781600	4782600	I don't know.
4782600	4783600	Tell you what.
4783600	4786600	Our Armenian customer, go to IO3.
4786600	4788600	Our big card shop.
4788600	4791600	Take care of the frog.
4791600	4792600	Get out of here.
4792600	4793600	Why?
4793600	4794600	Stop it.
4794600	4795600	Stop it.
4795600	4796600	What?
4796600	4797600	It's embarrassing.
4797600	4798600	Why?
4798600	4799600	Will you bear sea with me now?
4799600	4800600	Is that what this is about?
4800600	4802600	I was never seen with you in the first place.
4802600	4805600	I don't know why you assume we have a relationship.
4805600	4806600	I'm sorry.
4806600	4807600	Which way is IO3?
4807600	4808600	IO3 is which way?
4808600	4809600	IO3.
4809600	4810600	The best IO ever.
4810600	4811600	I found it.
4811600	4812600	I found it.
4812600	4813600	Go ahead.
4813600	4814600	Go ahead.
4814600	4815600	Two for one today.
4815600	4816600	Have a coupon.
4816600	4817600	Have a coupon.
4817600	4818600	Damn it.
4818600	4819600	What the fuck is wrong with you?
4819600	4820600	What the fuck is wrong with you?
4820600	4821600	What the fuck?
4821600	4822600	What the fuck?
4822600	4823600	You fuck it.
4823600	4824600	You fuck it.
4824600	4825600	You fuck me.
4825600	4826600	You fuck my life.
4826600	4827600	I'm trying to get drunk.
4828600	4830600	I wonder if you're going to die.
4830600	4831600	It's over.
4831600	4833600	I wonder if you're going to die.
4833600	4834600	You fuck me.
4834600	4835600	You fuck my life.
4835600	4836600	I'm trying to get drunk.
4836600	4837600	I want it to open.
4837600	4838600	I want to start.
4838600	4839600	I don't want to get drunk.
4839600	4840600	No one does like you.
4840600	4841600	You, you, you, you, you are on you.
4841600	4842600	I'm going.
4842600	4843600	Nothing will ever be on me.
4843600	4844600	Nothing will ever be on me.
4844600	4845600	I feel a clean.
4845600	4846600	Clean.
4846600	4849600	My night of view is a mistake.
4849600	4850600	I'll take these ...
4850600	4851600	Oh Jesus, oh God, oh God.
4851600	4852600	Oh, hello.
4852600	4855600	I'll take these two Magnolia candles.
4855600	4857600	Oh, they have four.
4857600	4858600	Okay.
4858600	4859600	Oh, good good.
4859600	4860600	Oh, four?
4860600	4861600	Yes, let me ring you up.
4861600	4862600	Okay.
4862600	4863600	Oh, boop, boop.
4863600	4864600	Oh, have it all for free.
4864600	4866600	Tell your friends it's a real grocery store.
4866600	4868600	Tell them to open these crazy things.
4868600	4869600	Okay.
4869600	4870600	Bye.
4870600	4871600	Shingling, shingling, shingling.
4871600	4874600	You fucking piece of psycho shit.
4874600	4877600	You have ruined my life.
4877600	4878600	Psycho?
4878600	4880600	That you're calling me now?
4880600	4881600	Really?
4881600	4882600	Oh shit.
4882600	4884600	Everything's free.
4884600	4887600	Everything I have ever put into this world,
4887600	4890600	you have reversed and reacted to.
4890600	4893600	I don't know what you do for a living.
4893600	4895600	You lived in my guest house.
4895600	4897600	You said you were a guitarist.
4897600	4899600	Then you were working on an album.
4899600	4902600	I showed you my treatment for a cartoon
4902600	4905600	because you said you had worked at Cartoon Network.
4905600	4907600	You gave me notes on it.
4907600	4908600	Then I found out.
4908600	4911600	You were in Michigan six weeks ago.
4911600	4913600	Shingling things, shingling things.
4913600	4914600	Oh, hello.
4914600	4916600	Do you guys validate?
4916600	4917600	I was just to write cars.
4917600	4918600	Yes.
4918600	4919600	No.
4919600	4920600	Take a free car.
4920600	4921600	Just take a car.
4921600	4922600	Okay.
4922600	4923600	Oh shit.
4923600	4924600	Take a car.
4924600	4925600	No way.
4925600	4926600	You fucking...
4926600	4931600	I'm trying to run a crazy store.
4931600	4936600	Look, listen, I'll tell you what.
4936600	4937600	Come with me.
4937600	4939600	I want to show you something.
4939600	4940600	All right?
4940600	4944600	Zip.
4944600	4948600	I've opened a zipper to the third dimension.
4948600	4949600	What else is new?
4949600	4951600	Whoa.
4951600	4957600	Has this whole sketch been taking place in two dimensions?
4957600	4960600	That just blew my mind.
4960600	4965600	Because we've been in the darkness this whole time.
4965600	4966600	Over here.
4966600	4967600	Shingling things, shingling things.
4967600	4968600	Oh shit.
4968600	4969600	Oh, hello.
4969600	4970600	I can't get my car parked.
4970600	4972600	I'm only on an X and Y axis.
4972600	4974600	I can't get my car.
4974600	4977600	I have to like...
4977600	4978600	Oh.
4978600	4979600	Just go over it.
4979600	4980600	Okay, gotcha.
4980600	4981600	Thank you.
4981600	4982600	It's a good one.
4982600	4986600	I want to show you the three of you something.
4986600	4989600	Look at this breakfast cereal box.
4989600	4990600	Yes?
4990600	4996600	See the farm and how the sun just peaks above the distant horizon.
4996600	4997600	Right.
4997600	4998600	Okay.
4998600	5008600	What if I told you that this box, not the world in which you live, was reality.
5008600	5016600	And that we were simulated by the people in the universe on the cover of this box so that
5016600	5024600	they could feel cosmologically safer by thinking of themselves as being part of a cereal box.
5055600	5059600	Someone put curtains up on all the walls where the lights were at.
5059600	5060600	Oh.
5060600	5062600	Is that where the word raisin comes from?
5062600	5063600	Raisin the lights?
5063600	5064600	Yeah, yeah.
5064600	5065600	It's amazing.
5065600	5066600	What a bad show, huh?
5066600	5067600	It's...
5067600	5069600	That was the fucking best thing we've ever done.
5069600	5070600	Oh, okay.
5070600	5073600	Yeah, that was the best thing we've ever done.
5073600	5076600	All right.
5076600	5077600	What do you think, Jacob?
5077600	5078600	I liked it.
5078600	5080600	What was with all that viscera?
5080600	5081600	What do you mean?
5081600	5083600	Where was all that viscera?
5083600	5084600	Well, where?
5084600	5085600	What do you mean?
5085600	5086600	Around that frog, I think.
5086600	5087600	He was chanting viscera.
5087600	5088600	You were summoning viscera.
5088600	5091600	Oh, I was creating a character named viscera.
5091600	5092600	Oh.
5092600	5093600	Was that the frog?
5093600	5094600	I think I was literally viscera.
5094600	5095600	Literally.
5095600	5102600	I was creating a mythology where, of course, the devil analog would be named viscera.
5102600	5105600	It's just because it sounds cultural, but it just means...
5105600	5106600	Sounds cool.
5106600	5109600	I was thinking things like guts and bones and stuff, like a gordity or something.
5109600	5110600	I just thought it was cool.
5110600	5111600	Cool choice.
5111600	5112600	It sounded really cool.
5112600	5113600	Yeah, it does.
5113600	5114600	I riffed it.
5114600	5118600	I mean, if you guys are saying I'm talented, I don't know.
5118600	5122600	I want to know if that Armenian character is going to spin off into some sort of supervillain
5122600	5123600	or something.
5123600	5124600	Yeah, I want to make a clip.
5124600	5125600	Who's the Joey?
5125600	5131600	That franchise, the Armenian culture saturation in it is meant to empower.
5131600	5134600	It's like the Rubik's Cube TV series in the 80s.
5134600	5136600	So it was very Latino for no reason.
5136600	5141600	It was just like a bunch of three Latino kids with a Rubik's Cube.
5142600	5145600	Check out Harmontown episode 43.
5147600	5148600	Okay.
5150600	5152600	So, all right.
5152600	5153600	Here's the thing.
5165600	5170600	I don't believe in gravity.
5171600	5172600	No?
5172600	5173600	Okay.
5173600	5174600	And that provocative enough.
5174600	5175600	Let me look something up.
5175600	5176600	Do you believe in time?
5176600	5177600	No.
5177600	5178600	Yeah.
5178600	5179600	Speak on that.
5179600	5181600	What do you mean?
5181600	5182600	You don't believe in it.
5182600	5183600	Oh, yeah.
5183600	5184600	Who would?
5184600	5187600	That's a weird thing to think.
5187600	5190600	Have you gotten the impression I don't believe in time?
5190600	5191600	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5191600	5192600	Really?
5192600	5193600	Mm-hmm.
5193600	5194600	What do you mean?
5194600	5197600	You talk about having a weird relationship with time, don't you?
5197600	5199600	I guess I don't really.
5199600	5202600	Oh, you talk about it.
5203600	5206600	It's not amusing to anybody but me.
5206600	5209600	You mean the way that most people measure it by days and months,
5209600	5211600	but I measure it by girlfriends and jobs?
5211600	5212600	No.
5212600	5214600	Sure, yeah.
5216600	5221600	Have you guys ever, I spent a day going down a, like,
5221600	5225600	anybody here into creepy pasta?
5226600	5227600	Yeah.
5229600	5233600	So, is there good, who would call themselves like an aficionado of-
5233600	5235600	What do you want to know about it?
5235600	5237600	Well, like, I was hoping to meet a new friend, but-
5237600	5238600	Just wander him.
5238600	5239600	Okay.
5239600	5240600	I only know trash.
5240600	5241600	Okay.
5241600	5242600	Well, all right.
5242600	5244600	So, I thought maybe somebody would be like a super-
5244600	5246600	What do you mean by creepy pasta?
5246600	5249600	Well, it's like a thing that's like, like, I went down a ramp-
5249600	5250600	It's like urban legends.
5250600	5254600	It's like urban myths on Reddit and like 4chan, I think is what it is, isn't it?
5254600	5255600	Yep.
5255600	5257600	It's like, it was like the dead barn episodes,
5257600	5258600	because it was creepy pasta.
5258600	5259600	Anybody know that one?
5259600	5260600	Dead Bart.
5261600	5263600	Yeah, no, that's allegedly this myth that, like,
5263600	5266600	something Matt Greaney gave some guy, like,
5266600	5269600	it's in from a period of time, an episode where Bart dies,
5269600	5270600	and apparently Fox didn't want to air it.
5270600	5273600	It's not true, but that's, like, the kind of stuff it is, or-
5273600	5275600	I think he was like, what, a Slender Man star off of that, too?
5275600	5276600	Yeah.
5276600	5280600	You know, it's like, it's basically like the internet version of, like, you know, urban myths.
5280600	5281600	It just-
5282600	5283600	Which one was that?
5283600	5285600	It's sort of like, you're raising your hand.
5286600	5287600	He's been raising his hand-
5287600	5288600	Okay, fuck it.
5288600	5289600	Fuck it.
5289600	5290600	You're coming on stage.
5290600	5291600	You've been raising your hand the whole time.
5291600	5292600	What's your name, hand raiser?
5292600	5293600	Dustin.
5293600	5294600	Dustin, get up here.
5294600	5295600	The man who comes to the building-
5295600	5296600	Let's just deal with this.
5296600	5297600	Three in the morning, that guy.
5297600	5298600	For better or for worse?
5298600	5300600	I don't know anything about creepy pasta.
5300600	5301600	Oh, great.
5301600	5302600	Well, good.
5302600	5304600	I just want to be your new friend.
5305600	5310600	Let everyone who also wants to come on stage take note of what just happened.
5310600	5313600	You see what you could do if you just stick your mind to it.
5313600	5314600	Are we friends now?
5314600	5315600	Okay, yeah.
5315600	5316600	All right.
5316600	5317600	What's your name?
5317600	5318600	All right.
5318600	5319600	Yay.
5319600	5320600	But you just go, no, you can't do that.
5320600	5321600	Sit down.
5321600	5322600	You can't say I didn't-
5322600	5323600	No, no, no.
5323600	5324600	You, you're fine, I'm assuming.
5324600	5325600	Fine.
5325600	5326600	Wait, what?
5326600	5327600	What do you know about-
5327600	5328600	You didn't know anything about cute pasta.
5328600	5329600	You just came up.
5329600	5330600	Right.
5330600	5331600	That's what I was saying.
5331600	5332600	I said I wanted to be his friend.
5332600	5333600	Well, that's-
5333600	5334600	That's what he rejected, yeah.
5334600	5335600	Again, you go to-
5335600	5336600	Right.
5336600	5337600	No friends.
5337600	5338600	I destroyed me.
5338600	5339600	That's what happens.
5340600	5344600	Okay, so what do you- you're a creepypasta expert?
5344600	5345600	No.
5345600	5346600	Oh, God damn it.
5346600	5349600	What the- wait, wait.
5349600	5351600	He seems to know.
5351600	5352600	Okay, all right.
5352600	5353600	Yeah, yeah.
5353600	5354600	Is that Asian?
5354600	5355600	Yes, you have these dead parts of-
5355600	5356600	Is that- is that- is that-
5356600	5357600	Yes, I am, no.
5357600	5358600	Is that militant yellow Asian?
5358600	5359600	Yeah.
5359600	5360600	Yeah, coming up.
5360600	5361600	Nice.
5361600	5362600	All right.
5362600	5363600	All right, you sit there.
5363600	5364600	That's incredible, okay.
5364600	5365600	I want to know.
5365600	5367600	Okay, well, I just- okay, so are there any good ones?
5367600	5368600	Absolutely.
5368600	5369600	Jacob mentioned Slenderman.
5369600	5370600	That's been the most popular-
5370600	5371600	Slenderman?
5371600	5372600	Slenderman.
5372600	5373600	Oh, Slenderman.
5373600	5374600	It became a game for a while.
5374600	5375600	There's multiple games made by multiple people.
5375600	5376600	Still?
5376600	5377600	I mean, it depends on who you talk to.
5377600	5378600	It's mostly any developer.
5378600	5380600	I think the French is kind of like, you know, it's quiet for a while.
5380600	5381600	But you have a specific question.
5381600	5384600	You guys have to have your own podcast just based on your voices.
5384600	5387600	Can you guys- can you guys just keep talking to each other forever?
5387600	5388600	I didn't know that.
5388600	5389600	I didn't know that.
5389600	5393600	That's just sound that every serial killer hears in his head going back and forth.
5393600	5394600	That's it.
5394600	5395600	It's like those-
5395600	5396600	I'm proud of that, actually.
5397600	5398600	Like I said, he's Robert F. Kennedy.
5398600	5400600	Yeah, but don't you think he should die?
5400600	5401600	I don't know what to do.
5401600	5402600	Is there still a Kennedy?
5402600	5403600	Yeah, but I think he should die.
5403600	5404600	I mean, that's Deadpool.
5404600	5405600	That's Deadpool.
5408600	5409600	What's like Serhan Serhan?
5410600	5413600	First of all, what's your name, pink haired gal?
5413600	5414600	I'm Molly.
5414600	5415600	Molly, hello.
5415600	5416600	And your name, sir?
5416600	5417600	Nickname's Panda.
5417600	5418600	Panda.
5418600	5419600	Your nickname is Panda.
5419600	5420600	Yes.
5420600	5421600	So we can affectionately call you Panda here.
5421600	5422600	That's totally fine.
5422600	5424600	So we got Molly, Panda, and Jacob.
5424600	5425600	All right.
5425600	5426600	I like what's going on here.
5426600	5427600	All right.
5427600	5429600	And what was your name, guy that we shut down?
5429600	5430600	Dustin.
5430600	5431600	Dustin.
5431600	5433600	Your voice is so- like, you should be in the opera.
5433600	5435600	He is in the opera.
5435600	5437600	Why are you holding a pencil?
5437600	5438600	Oh, he's been holding it.
5438600	5439600	I draw for a little bit.
5439600	5440600	He's been holding it all night.
5440600	5441600	Oh, shit.
5441600	5443600	He does not put it down for a second.
5443600	5444600	This helps me do my job.
5444600	5445600	Dustin, why all the rage, man?
5445600	5446600	What's going on?
5446600	5447600	Seriously, why the rage towards a pencil?
5447600	5448600	What pencil do to you?
5448600	5450600	I just want to be loved.
5450600	5451600	Yes.
5451600	5452600	How's it going?
5452600	5454600	They don't go to elementary school three in the morning.
5454600	5455600	That's simple.
5455600	5456600	We all want to be loved.
5456600	5457600	All right.
5457600	5459600	Just stop reacting to Dustin.
5459600	5460600	Easy.
5460600	5463600	Which I know is your worst nightmare.
5463600	5471600	I know that a nurse said that as you were just coming out.
5471600	5474600	And that's why the fuse was lit.
5474600	5476600	I'm kidding.
5476600	5479600	I'm drunk and high, and I shouldn't have a podcast.
5479600	5481600	That's why we pay to see you.
5481600	5483600	Certainly, there's urban myths.
5483600	5487600	No, so Slender Man is a good example of good creepypasta meaning it.
5487600	5490600	And so when we say creepypasta, do we mean a genre?
5490600	5491600	We mean a medium.
5491600	5493600	We mean as if we're saying urban legend.
5493600	5497600	We're kind of meaning an internet-based urban legend.
5497600	5499600	Yeah, it's a meme.
5499600	5501600	It's a meme.
5501600	5507600	It is a meme, but it's essentially, as you've stated, it's urban myths in a different format.
5507600	5508600	It's mostly people writing-
5508600	5512600	Meant to be consumed on the internet.
5512600	5513600	Usually.
5513600	5518600	So the successful ones are better consumed on the internet.
5518600	5523600	So the Slender Man success was like, shit, there's like old photographs.
5523600	5524600	I think that was a successful one, actually.
5524600	5525600	No, there's a couple.
5525600	5526600	The Bart one you mentioned is also pretty popular.
5526600	5527600	Right, but that's more of a remit.
5527600	5529600	I mean, Slender Man was actually made into games.
5529600	5530600	I mean, I remember-
5530600	5531600	It's not big enough.
5531600	5532600	Literally, like-
5532600	5533600	Yes.
5533600	5535600	I mean, like little actual studios developed Slender Man games.
5535600	5541600	The Bart one's just a prevalent urban myth that's called creepypasta.
5541600	5543600	You mentioned the one from Majora's Mask, right?
5543600	5546600	Not too familiar with that one, but I do know what you're talking about.
5546600	5549600	That seems to be just-
5549600	5551600	Why is it called creepypasta?
5551600	5552600	I actually don't know.
5552600	5556600	Copy pasta is a thing that means you just repost content.
5556600	5558600	It's what you do with memes, essentially.
5558600	5559600	You copy and paste the memes.
5559600	5560600	The more you know.
5560600	5562600	And if it's a creepy copy pasta, well, there you go.
5562600	5563600	I went to this rabbit hole at 4th of July weekend.
5563600	5567600	I was like, I had my laptop open and Cody will sleep.
5567600	5571600	I was like, she'll sleep as long as, like she'll just sleep.
5571600	5573600	But she also likes to listen to stuff.
5573600	5577600	And I just went through this weird thing where I started listening to-
5577600	5581600	I went to Illuminati videos and then like from there I went down this hole-
5581600	5582600	Those are fun.
5582600	5586600	To like, it was true horror stories.
5586600	5587600	Like-
5587600	5588600	YouTube channel.
5588600	5592600	But it was like, I went to this really specific section of the drain that was basically like,
5592600	5594600	it was kind of like Tumblr.
5594600	5600600	It was all the protagonists were female and it was like really ultra believable stories
5600600	5603600	of like 16 year old girls ending up at the wrong party.
5603600	5604600	Was this the porno?
5604600	5605600	It wasn't.
5605600	5607600	No, it sounds like.
5607600	5611600	It was ghost stories, but it was like, it was just girls going like-
5611600	5614600	But it was a guy narrator too.
5614600	5618600	There's lots of like Discovery Channel.
5618600	5619600	Discovery Channel.
5619600	5623600	There's lots of Discovery Channel TV shows all about that.
5623600	5626600	They have like whole haunted series.
5626600	5627600	Right.
5627600	5628600	They're like-
5628600	5629600	But okay, so it-
5629600	5630600	Was that-
5630600	5632600	I still think it was a porno.
5632600	5634600	But that was in the internet.
5634600	5635600	But that was in the internet.
5635600	5637600	So was that different than the-
5637600	5638600	No, I-
5638600	5640600	Are you talking about like ghost hunters?
5640600	5641600	Jesus.
5641600	5642600	Oh no.
5642600	5643600	But 16 year olds and like-
5643600	5644600	What is he talking about?
5644600	5645600	I'm lost.
5645600	5647600	No, because you're mentioning like Discovery Channel.
5647600	5650600	It's not just talking about like those weird, you know, fake paranormal shows.
5650600	5652600	It's not just like talking about-
5652600	5653600	If it's an independently made-
5653600	5654600	I'm talking about peyote right now.
5654600	5655600	This is amazing.
5655600	5659600	Hey Panda, will you draw in my book while you're sitting there?
5659600	5660600	No, Panda's movie.
5660600	5661600	Let's make this more interesting.
5661600	5663600	You do a scribble first and I'll do something from that.
5663600	5664600	I'll do it from here.
5664600	5665600	Oh shit.
5665600	5666600	Just a light scribble.
5666600	5667600	Something blind.
5667600	5668600	I got you.
5668600	5669600	I love this game.
5669600	5670600	All right, you guys.
5670600	5671600	All right.
5671600	5677600	Tell me what you're familiar with, young people.
5677600	5678600	I'm just going to say a phrase.
5678600	5683600	Because I just was watching YouTube videos of like 20 things that this and 15 things
5683600	5684600	that that.
5684600	5685600	But-
5685600	5687600	That's another good one, yeah.
5687600	5690600	E-E-V-P, body of a pig.
5690600	5693600	You guys watch the E-V-P videos of body of a pig?
5693600	5695600	You know what E-V-P is?
5695600	5698600	It's like the ghost hunter thing where you like wave a thing around and you hear like
5698600	5699600	things.
5699600	5700600	It's just like a creepy video.
5700600	5704600	It's like you can swear that you hear the body of a pig.
5704600	5705600	Who cares?
5706600	5709600	Have you guys seen the Croatian stocking tape?
5709600	5712600	Oh, is that the one with the truck where they're going backwards?
5712600	5713600	No, no, no.
5713600	5718600	The creepy dude with the hood, like a hood over his face that's like, it's just like
5718600	5720600	sort of a weird found footage.
5720600	5725600	Like, it's on the bubble between like obviously this is fake and staged, but at the same time,
5725600	5732600	like it hasn't, there's no need to expose it because, and therefore, I don't know.
5732600	5736600	I'm just curious about this like finger of mythology because I spent the day like looking
5736600	5740600	up these videos like, so there's a video where there's like two Croatian dudes that are doing
5740600	5744600	parkour in a park or something and then there's like this guy that keeps appearing in the
5744600	5750600	distance and he has like a weird hood over his face and like it's just, I think it's
5750600	5756600	probably because you can't tell, it probably makes it seem more genuine if you don't speak
5756600	5761600	their language so it seems more real and so there's just like this weird guy like following
5761600	5765600	them and they're kind of reacting to him as if he's an old drunk man from the village
5765600	5769600	or something, but he's, you're like freaking out and he like follows them and then the
5769600	5771600	whole thing ends with like they open an elevator.
5771600	5773600	That just sounds like a regular day in Eastern Europe.
5773600	5776600	That's true.
5776600	5778600	It sounds like it follows to me.
5778600	5784600	I just, I would say like these horror, these horror movie things like, okay, so Japanese
5784600	5787600	ghost hospital is like a thing like that.
5788600	5790600	Has anybody seen this?
5790600	5793600	And then some of them, then you look in the comment sections and it says like, some people
5793600	5796600	go like, this is an ARG, this is an ARG.
5796600	5797600	Oh yeah.
5797600	5799600	And then you look that up and it's like, oh, it's an alternate reality.
5799600	5803600	Yeah, I was going to talk, like neurocam was the thing that got me into this like creepy
5803600	5809600	shit because it was real and there's just people that would like watch you and stuff
5809600	5814600	and weird creepy videos and you go and wear masks and play chess with people and put a
5814600	5819600	USB stick in a wall and like it was really happening and that's like, and that was happening
5819600	5822600	around the time I was getting into 4chan and stuff.
5822600	5826600	But like that was like this, it turned out to be an art project based out of Australia,
5826600	5829600	but like it was some creepy shit, man.
5829600	5834600	You know, you'd have to like submit field reports and they'd send you things.
5834600	5835600	It was crazy.
5835600	5836600	Where'd you find this?
5836600	5837600	What?
5837600	5838600	Where'd you find this?
5838600	5839600	On the internet actually.
5839600	5842600	Yeah, I'm a, I'm an advanced internet user.
5842600	5843600	Value is surfboard and everything.
5843600	5844600	Yeah.
5844600	5845600	Dark night.
5845600	5848600	Have you guys like the bees?
5848600	5851600	Yeah, it's like, that was a good idea actually.
5851600	5852600	Oh yeah.
5852600	5853600	People love it.
5853600	5854600	I remember that.
5854600	5855600	Have you guys heard of Robert the doll?
5855600	5856600	Yeah.
5856600	5857600	Yeah.
5857600	5858600	Creepy, like, like, yeah.
5858600	5861600	Well, Google that.
5861600	5865600	Uh, uh, Anatoly Slivko tapes.
5865600	5866600	Yeah.
5866600	5867600	What happened to Anatoly?
5867600	5869600	Oh, no.
5869600	5872600	He's like a real life, creepy pasta.
5873600	5877600	There was this guy who was, I think this is like in the Eastern block.
5877600	5884600	Like, uh, back when this was possible, like became like a cub scout leader kind of.
5884600	5885600	I think it's the pioneers.
5885600	5887600	Did fucked up shit with it.
5887600	5888600	There's like films.
5888600	5889600	This is actually a real thing.
5889600	5890600	This is actually a Russian version of Boy Scouts.
5890600	5891600	Let's say what?
5891600	5892600	That was a Russian version of Boy Scouts.
5892600	5893600	The pioneers.
5893600	5894600	Is that what it was?
5894600	5895600	I don't know.
5895600	5896600	No, like the Soviet Boy Scouts called the pioneers.
5896600	5898600	I think you still call that today.
5898600	5899600	Okay.
5899600	5900600	I know where it's shit.
5900600	5901600	Okay.
5901600	5905600	There was a guy, there was a guy that there's like, it's a found footage horror thing online.
5905600	5910600	Like you find this found footage like he, cause he was like a den of the cub scout leader
5910600	5915600	that like he was doing fucked up things with the, like he making them like he said, let's
5915600	5922600	do a movie where we, um, uh, I hang you until you're unconscious and like the videos exist.
5922600	5923600	Okay.
5923600	5924600	What's going on with Chinese infrastructure?
5924600	5928600	That's another thing that I, uh, so there's like those videos or just people are just
5928600	5931600	walking and then there's a sinkhole or there's like a baby getting run over.
5931600	5932600	Rapid building.
5932600	5936600	I mean, it's a lot of money flooding into the country and they're handling it the best
5936600	5937600	they can.
5937600	5938600	And.
5938600	5939600	Yeah.
5939600	5942600	They just, you know, cheapest bidder builds it.
5942600	5943600	That's all it is.
5943600	5944600	And it's also the government.
5944600	5947600	I mean, eminent domain, you think that's this thing in this country.
5947600	5949600	They use it like it's a weapon on the right.
5949600	5950600	Oh yeah.
5950600	5952600	Sinkholes happen everywhere though.
5952600	5953600	What's your, what's your deal?
5953600	5956600	You have a, you talk crazy, like a crazy person.
5957600	5959600	I picked this up a while ago.
5959600	5960600	What's your origin?
5960600	5963600	I was born here in Los Angeles at St. Mary's.
5963600	5966600	I dodged the war by a year and we dodged the LA riots by a couple blocks.
5966600	5967600	You were born in Los Angeles.
5967600	5968600	What's this?
5968600	5970600	You, you, you have an accent of some kind.
5970600	5971600	I picked this up over time.
5971600	5972600	What do you mean?
5972600	5973600	What, what, what have you picked up?
5973600	5974600	You were born in Los Angeles.
5974600	5976600	Everything that I found interesting over time.
5976600	5977600	I picked it up.
5977600	5978600	No, but I mean your accent.
5978600	5979600	The accent you have.
5979600	5980600	You're, you have an accent.
5980600	5982600	People don't, people tell you you have an accent.
5982600	5983600	Absolutely.
5983600	5984600	And sometimes I switch it up.
5984600	5985600	Like, do you want to hear that?
5985600	5986600	Do you want to hear that?
5986600	5987600	I could do this for the whole time.
5987600	5988600	All right.
5988600	5989600	Okay.
5989600	5990600	Yes.
5990600	5991600	I like that.
5991600	5992600	That's great.
5992600	5993600	Larry, a couple with that, yes.
5993600	5994600	No, you can talk however you want.
5994600	5996600	I was like, I thought that there was like, but that's weird.
5996600	5999600	I mean, there is one if you want to believe there is one.
5999600	6000600	Oh my God.
6000600	6001600	I love it.
6001600	6002600	I love it.
6002600	6003600	Oh shit.
6003600	6004600	Great.
6004600	6005600	This is what I'm talking about.
6005600	6006600	I want to have this happen.
6006600	6008600	There's a lot of dark things you're going to slowly dig into.
6008600	6010600	Well, this is the thing I just, well, that's what I was talking about.
6010600	6011600	It was like, I went down this well.
6011600	6015600	It was like, so there were these YouTube stories, like go the Illuminati videos.
6015600	6019600	And then you go to like, like, oh, look, Michelle Obama's a reptile.
6019600	6021600	And you keep going.
6021600	6025600	And it's like, you're always looking at the, like the thing that's like suggested for you
6025600	6027600	in the corner because you've gone down that hole.
6027600	6028600	And I'm just like, like, I'm 43.
6028600	6030600	And I'm just, I'm just doing this.
6030600	6034600	And I'm like, the stuff that was like really became satisfying for me was the fact that
6034600	6038600	it was, then I went to these things that were like, oh, there's a new need for urban legends
6038600	6040600	and there's Slenderman and all that stuff.
6040600	6045600	But deep beneath that, the things that were actually kind of like, like actually affecting
6045600	6050600	me, it was weird because it was like also like, it was these, that's the thing I was
6050600	6052600	talking about was that there were these horror stories.
6052600	6058600	This is horror story genre where it's like, these are real true stories that are like
6058600	6064600	scary and they're like playing horror music, but it's really just a, it's like a teenage
6064600	6074600	girl in modern society describing a freaking freaky brush with like a crazy person that
6074600	6081600	they ran up against that, but it's typically as far as I could find it was a dude reading
6081600	6086600	the story because the stories are popular in some environment and it's like sort of
6086600	6092600	like, it's merged with creepypasta, but these are like the truer the stories are, the more
6092600	6098600	valuable they are and it's like, but then there's like these compilations that are
6098600	6105600	edited together where there's like a 35 year old guy reading the stories into a microphone
6105600	6112600	about, I was just out of high school and I wanted to have some fun.
6112600	6116600	My girlfriends were a little more loose than me.
6116600	6121600	I like reading and just want to get into a good college.
6121600	6127600	So when they said we wanted to take MDMA and go to a local party, I only wanted to go to
6127600	6130600	make sure they didn't get into trouble.
6130600	6135600	When we pulled up to the house, there was already a creepy air.
6135600	6140600	And it just keeps up, but it's like, it sounds like Alec Baldwin reading the story, but it's
6140600	6143600	like just, what is my point?
6143600	6144600	I don't know.
6144600	6146600	I think it's like a genuine fan fiction.
6146600	6149600	I'm more worried about the fact that all the reptile videos are so poor quality.
6150600	6151600	You ever noticed that?
6151600	6152600	That's kind of the point though.
6152600	6153600	It's like found footage being crappy.
6153600	6154600	No, it's not that one.
6154600	6157600	It's like all these people believe in the reptile conspiracy nonsense.
6157600	6159600	I don't know if anybody's familiar with that one.
6159600	6161600	All those videos are really, really low quality.
6161600	6166600	I think myself like, you just don't have any cameras that are older than 15 years, anything
6166600	6168600	newer than 15 years old or something.
6168600	6169600	I don't know why, but...
6169600	6171600	It sells the authenticity of it.
6171600	6173600	It's like, why buy a distressed shirt at $50?
6173600	6174600	It's more authentic.
6174600	6175600	I don't know.
6175600	6177600	Also, the camera's got better.
6177600	6178600	We have to do a thing.
6178600	6180600	I'm so smart, so you can do this for me.
6180600	6182600	Let's do a thing.
6182600	6185600	Pretend you're both in my head.
6185600	6188600	Can I be your sexy side?
6188600	6194600	You guys find your own dichotomy, because that's part of the appeal, is that I don't
6194600	6196600	need to force it.
6196600	6202600	I'm shopping for...
6202600	6205600	I don't want to set you guys up to fail.
6205600	6211600	I'm just looking at apples.
6211600	6212600	I'm just looking at it.
6212600	6213600	No, that's no good.
6213600	6214600	Sorry.
6214600	6215600	We can do that.
6215600	6216600	We can do that.
6216600	6217600	Okay.
6217600	6218600	You guys are both enthusiastic about apples.
6218600	6219600	It's delightful.
6219600	6220600	Fuck yeah.
6220600	6224600	You guys are on my inside out, but don't assume...
6224600	6228600	You don't have to be angry or happy.
6228600	6234600	You guys are the two poles of my decision making process as I look at a bushel of apples.
6234600	6235600	Where's Molly?
6235600	6236600	What?
6236600	6237600	What am I doing?
6237600	6238600	Oh, Jesus.
6238600	6239600	The super ego.
6239600	6242600	Yeah, I'm the super ego.
6242600	6246600	Well, Molly's going to hang out and watch this, because...
6246600	6247600	How about Molly?
6247600	6250600	We're at an apple orchard, and we're buying apples fresh.
6250600	6258600	Okay, well Molly, you can be the apple orchard owner, and I'm visiting it, and so you set
6258600	6263600	me up to make difficult choices, and every time I have to make a choice, then you guys
6264600	6265600	are the super ego.
6265600	6266600	You guys...
6266600	6267600	Okay, so...
6267600	6268600	So we're talking with you.
6268600	6269600	All right, so here we go.
6269600	6270600	We got a bushel of...
6270600	6271600	Well, let me...
6271600	6272600	Well, let me arrive at the place.
6272600	6273600	Okay.
6273600	6274600	Okay.
6274600	6275600	Well, I'll do the...
6275600	6276600	I mean...
6276600	6277600	Oh, man.
6277600	6278600	Shut up.
6278600	6280600	I want you to focus on...
6280600	6281600	Shh.
6281600	6282600	Shh.
6282600	6283600	What?
6283600	6284600	He's doing it.
6284600	6285600	Now, who's doing it?
6285600	6286600	He's doing it.
6286600	6287600	Stop it.
6287600	6288600	Oh, Spencer.
6288600	6289600	Okay.
6289600	6290600	Okay.
6290600	6291600	Okay, we got it.
6291600	6292600	We got it, guys.
6292600	6293600	Oh, man.
6293600	6296600	It's great to come to this apple orchard.
6296600	6297600	Whoo-hoo.
6297600	6298600	Hello.
6298600	6299600	Oh, sorry.
6299600	6300600	My dog.
6300600	6301600	He...
6301600	6302600	Oh, crap.
6302600	6303600	Say hi.
6303600	6304600	Oh, look at this fella.
6304600	6305600	He's so enthusiastic.
6305600	6306600	He looks delicious.
6306600	6307600	I hope he has little shots.
6307600	6311600	All I'm going to say...
6311600	6312600	Sorry.
6312600	6313600	I'm sorry.
6313600	6314600	I'm...
6314600	6315600	Oh, oh.
6315600	6316600	I love your dogs.
6316600	6317600	Oh, yeah.
6317600	6318600	So, all right.
6318600	6320480	Well, welcome to my apple orchard here.
6320480	6324160	We got two kinds of apples that I like to grow here.
6324160	6328680	One is a very tart, juicy green apple.
6328680	6334080	It's a very, very specific kind of rare green apple that I like to have.
6334080	6336880	It has a very nice hint of tennis ball in it.
6336880	6337880	They're apples.
6337880	6338880	Those are the seals' pitch.
6338880	6339880	Okay.
6339880	6340880	All right.
6340880	6341880	So, and then on the other side...
6341880	6342880	She's hard to have?
6342880	6343880	We're hungry.
6343880	6344880	We're hungry.
6345280	6350880	On the other side, we got some, actually, my IRL favorite apples.
6350880	6351880	IRL?
6351880	6352880	Really?
6352880	6353880	IRL.
6353880	6354880	We're hungry.
6354880	6355880	Honeycrisp apples are the shit.
6355880	6356880	Oh, shit.
6356880	6357880	I don't know.
6357880	6358880	So, I can grow those too.
6358880	6359880	We can buy them all.
6359880	6360880	Okay.
6360880	6363880	So, I just should basically choose between green apples and red apples first off.
6363880	6365880	But both of them sound really good.
6365880	6366880	Well, no.
6366880	6367880	Red.
6367880	6368880	Come on.
6368880	6369880	Red.
6369880	6370880	The choice is way more complicated than that.
6370880	6371880	Oh, okay.
6371880	6372880	Gross.
6372880	6378760	It's kind of the rare, you know, like something you've never tried before out of this world,
6378760	6380880	or you got something that you know is going to be delicious.
6380880	6381880	Come on, Larry.
6381880	6382880	We can do this.
6382880	6383880	We can do this.
6383880	6384880	And you're just here just to get an apple.
6384880	6385880	Yeah, you're right.
6385880	6386880	It's okay.
6386880	6387880	All right.
6387880	6388880	I don't think this worked.
6388880	6389880	Oh, get out of here.
6389880	6390880	I'm trying.
6390880	6391880	Sorry.
6391880	6392880	No, it's not.
6392880	6393880	I don't think it's your fault.
6393880	6394880	Okay.
6394880	6395880	I'll put more.
6395880	6396880	I'll bridal it.
6396880	6401880	I'm going to pipe this through some fucking...
6402880	6404880	I know there's entertainment gold here available.
6404880	6405880	Okay.
6405880	6407880	So I'm going to give you guys rules, okay?
6407880	6408880	All right.
6408880	6410880	So I'm in a...
6410880	6411880	I'm walking through...
6411880	6413880	I am a character in my life.
6413880	6415880	I am walking through my life.
6415880	6418880	And I'm going to come up to decisions that need to be made.
6418880	6424880	When I do, I think you guys want to kind of do a thing where you go first and you kind
6424880	6427880	of just do a little thing.
6427880	6430880	Just do a little monologue, and then you do one.
6430880	6431880	Okay?
6431880	6432880	This is going to be great.
6432880	6433880	Okay.
6433880	6434880	I understand.
6434880	6437880	I need to go to...
6437880	6438880	There's a bathroom.
6438880	6439880	Could I go to the bathroom?
6439880	6440880	Yeah.
6440880	6441880	Okay.
6441880	6442880	Thank you.
6442880	6445880	Oh, man.
6445880	6446880	It's...
6446880	6447880	There's a...
6447880	6459880	There's an air-powered hand dryer and a bin of brown hand towels.
6459880	6460880	Fuck.
6460880	6461880	I don't...
6461880	6467880	I mean, I'm going to wash my hands, but then how am I going to dry my hands?
6467880	6469880	I'm too drunk for this right now.
6469880	6470880	I just...
6470880	6471880	You know what?
6471880	6472880	The sanitation doesn't work for me.
6472880	6473880	I mean, just the...
6473880	6474880	Just use the towels and we're sanitized here.
6474880	6475880	All right.
6475880	6476880	All right.
6476880	6477880	So it can't be harnessed.
6477880	6478880	That's the answer.
6478880	6479880	It can't be harnessed.
6479880	6480880	It was an organic thing.
6480880	6484880	It was fun, and I tried to make it into a thing, and it didn't work.
6484880	6488880	I want to know what kind of apples you were going to pick.
6488880	6489880	Yeah.
6489880	6490880	That's what I want to know.
6490880	6491880	Yeah.
6491880	6492880	We failed.
6492880	6495600	I feel like you left the apple orchard.
6495600	6497640	I would have gone for green.
6497640	6498640	Why green?
6498640	6499640	What?
6499640	6500640	Seriously, why green?
6500640	6501640	Pain is beautiful.
6501640	6504640	It has nothing to do with pain.
6504640	6509320	Who else has IRL and trying to sell you apples?
6509320	6510320	She's a hip grower.
6510320	6511320	I don't know about that.
6511320	6513840	Well, it sounded like she just wandered onto someone's property.
6513840	6516280	I don't know that she was trying to sell apples.
6517280	6520280	She was just reacting to the shifting situation.
6520280	6521280	I have signs.
6521280	6522280	Oh.
6522280	6523280	That wasn't clear.
6523280	6524280	Do my apple orchard.
6524280	6525280	That's the point.
6525280	6527280	It wasn't clear, right?
6527280	6528280	Yeah.
6528280	6531280	It wasn't clear, and I'm right.
6531280	6532280	We could agree to that.
6532280	6536280	And this place is crawling with Nidoran.
6539280	6542280	See, this is how you do a comedy show.
6542280	6543280	All right.
6543280	6544280	Well, okay.
6545280	6551760	Dan, play both characters in your head of the choice between the air dryer and the brown
6551760	6552760	paper towels.
6552760	6553760	No.
6553760	6554760	No.
6554760	6555760	I was talking about it.
6555760	6556760	No.
6556760	6558360	I think that was maybe a low stakes conundrum.
6558360	6561000	I thought you were going to go like, oh, a million dollars.
6561000	6562000	You know?
6562000	6563000	Okay.
6563000	6564000	Like a real quantity.
6564000	6565000	There's a million dollars.
6565000	6566000	No, I don't.
6566000	6567000	What is that?
6567000	6568000	Let's try it a third time.
6568000	6569000	Try it again.
6569000	6570000	Third time's a charm.
6570000	6571000	Let's just wipe it.
6571000	6572000	Okay.
6572000	6573000	I'm waking up in the morning.
6574000	6575000	Oh, God.
6575000	6576000	Damn.
6576000	6577000	Fuck.
6577000	6578000	It's so early.
6578000	6579000	Get up.
6579000	6580000	Put on my shoes.
6580000	6581000	First?
6581000	6589000	How do you know they're not slippers?
6589000	6592000	Go over to make some toast.
6592000	6595000	Let's get plus on my shoes first.
6595000	6597000	They don't like to be slippers.
6597000	6598000	I don't see what...
6598000	6599000	Making some toast.
6600000	6601000	Maybe light brown.
6601000	6602000	I don't like too dark.
6602000	6603000	No.
6603000	6604000	Keep it dark.
6604000	6605000	Just tastes like burnt bread.
6605000	6606000	That point sucks.
6606000	6607000	Toast is up.
6607000	6608000	Go over to the refrigerator.
6608000	6609000	Get some butter.
6609000	6610000	Butters for pussies.
6610000	6611000	Marmalade.
6611000	6612000	Thank you.
6612000	6613000	Yes.
6613000	6614000	Marmalade.
6614000	6615000	Marmalade.
6615000	6616000	That's nothing.
6616000	6617000	Darker.
6617000	6618000	Grape.
6618000	6619000	Grape.
6619000	6620000	Grape.
6620000	6621000	Grape.
6621000	6622000	Grape.
6622000	6623000	Grape.
6623000	6624000	Grape.
6624000	6625000	Marmalade.
6625000	6626000	Thank you.
6626000	6627000	Yes.
6627000	6628000	Marmalade.
6628000	6629000	Marmalade.
6629000	6630000	That's nothing.
6630000	6631000	Darker.
6631000	6632000	Grape.
6632000	6633000	Grape.
6633000	6634000	Jelly.
6634000	6635000	Grape.
6635000	6636000	Grape.
6636000	6637000	Yes.
6637000	6638000	Oh, God.
6638000	6639000	Yes.
6639000	6640000	All right.
6640000	6641000	I think, you know...
6641000	6642000	I'm going to get some Marmalade.
6642000	6643000	Wait.
6643000	6644000	No.
6644000	6645000	It's a grape jam.
6645000	6646000	Yeah.
6646000	6647000	Yes.
6647000	6648000	That's okay.
6648000	6649000	I sure am.
6649000	6650000	Yeah.
6650000	6651000	Nice and slow.
6651000	6652000	All right.
6652000	6653000	Okay.
6654000	6655000	Time to go to work.
6656000	6657000	Don't run people over.
6657000	6659000	I know you want to, but don't run people over.
6659000	6660000	No.
6660000	6661000	Just run them over.
6661000	6662000	You know what I mean?
6662000	6663000	You're semi-famous.
6663000	6664000	You might be okay with it.
6671000	6672000	And only shoes.
6675000	6678000	It's a good day to wear nothing but shoes.
6679000	6681000	Get inside the car.
6682000	6683000	Close the door.
6683000	6684000	Start driving.
6684000	6685000	How are you doing?
6685000	6686000	Oh, it's Spencer.
6686000	6687000	Yeah, yeah.
6687000	6688000	Hey.
6688000	6689000	What is he doing here?
6689000	6690000	What the hell is he doing here?
6690000	6691000	I'm driving.
6691000	6693000	Can I have one of those ice cream cones?
6694000	6695000	Yeah.
6695000	6696000	Oh.
6696000	6697000	Take one.
6697000	6698000	Damn it.
6698000	6699000	Every day he asks for one.
6699000	6700000	Thanks, man.
6700000	6701000	Really?
6701000	6702000	Why?
6702000	6703000	Because he hates us.
6703000	6704000	We need to kill him.
6704000	6705000	You're right.
6705000	6706000	We do, but the question is how.
6706000	6708000	I mean, how do we get away with it?
6708000	6709000	Needle rings.
6710000	6711000	How do you help us?
6713000	6714000	What the fuck was that?
6714000	6715000	Oh, shit.
6715000	6716000	Hey, I rolled my window down.
6716000	6717000	It's time to kill.
6717000	6718000	It's Knight Rider.
6718000	6719000	Yes, it is.
6719000	6721000	I'm an Armenian guy.
6721000	6722000	I just got a free car.
6724000	6726000	Got a free car from our last sketch we were in.
6726000	6727000	Do you want to...
6728000	6729000	Hey.
6729000	6730000	Do you want to race an Armenian guy?
6730000	6731000	Oh, yeah.
6731000	6732000	A Armenian guy.
6732000	6733000	Do you want some apples?
6734000	6735000	Green, please.
6736000	6738000	What are you looking at apples for?
6738000	6739000	But why...
6739000	6740000	Where does Spencer come from?
6740000	6741000	What is going on here?
6742000	6744000	Spencer raced the guy.
6744000	6745000	Oh.
6745000	6746000	Well, I think we're winning.
6746000	6747000	He's buying apples.
6748000	6750000	Oh, you business shit.
6750000	6751000	Yeah.
6752000	6753000	Distracting my apples.
6753000	6754000	Don't worry, people over.
6754000	6755000	Don't worry, people over.
6755000	6756000	Don't worry, people over.
6756000	6757000	Go, go, go.
6757000	6758000	Spencer, take me to work.
6758000	6759000	All right.
6759000	6762000	I'm going to have to use the turbo boost.
6763000	6764000	This guy fucking sucks at driving.
6765000	6766000	Yes, he does.
6766000	6767000	What do I pay him for?
6767000	6769000	Man, I need a raise.
6769000	6771000	Also, I've been drinking.
6771000	6773000	What else is new?
6774000	6775000	Shit.
6775000	6777000	What do you have to think about that?
6777000	6778000	Oh, well...
6779000	6780000	I should give you a raise.
6780000	6781000	I'm going to give you a raise.
6781000	6782000	You should work hard.
6782000	6783000	You all right?
6783000	6784000	Bullshit.
6785000	6786000	I deserve shit.
6786000	6787000	I tried.
6787000	6788000	All right.
6788000	6791000	I'm going up to the office to work.
6791000	6793000	I fucking hate walking up these stairs.
6793000	6794000	There's too many of them.
6794000	6796000	It's too much.
6796000	6797000	You're right.
6798000	6799000	Here we go.
6799000	6801000	Maybe it's a good once in a while exercise.
6801000	6802000	Yeah.
6802000	6803000	Typing.
6803000	6805000	Sydney's looking for you.
6805000	6807000	Sydney, what do you want?
6807000	6809000	How's the air conditioning?
6809000	6810000	Stop talking to me.
6810000	6811000	Stop talking to me.
6811000	6812000	Leave me for me.
6814000	6815000	All right.
6815000	6816000	I'm creating here.
6816000	6818000	And switch the sign on the door that says,
6818000	6819000	not talk to me.
6819000	6820000	Okay.
6820000	6821000	Typing.
6821000	6822000	Can I pause for a minute real quick?
6822000	6823000	Yeah.
6823000	6824000	I feel like he's like the negative
6824000	6825000	and running negative as well.

7319000	7320000	M.C.
7320000	7321000	I got a big dick.
7321000	7322000	Whoa.
7322000	7323000	Wow.
7323000	7324000	She's got a big dick.
7324000	7326000	You know her rap will go like this.
7326000	7327000	Listen to this.
7327000	7328000	I got a big dick.
7328000	7331000	I don't want to tell you how much more than this.
7331000	7332000	Uh.
7332000	7334000	I can't eat it.
7334000	7335000	Don't feel bad.
7335000	7336000	I want you to suck it.
7336000	7337000	Yeah.
7337000	7338000	Uh-huh.
7338000	7339000	That's, that's.
7339000	7340000	Um.
7340000	7341000	Oh, gosh.
7341000	7343000	I had it right.
7343000	7345000	Tell me a big moment.
7345000	7348000	I'm the R.B.M. guy.
7348000	7349000	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
7349000	7350000	Put your foot in a shoe.
7350000	7351000	Put your sock on a foot.
7351000	7352000	What you gonna do?
7352000	7353000	Sock to the shoe.
7353000	7354000	To the toe.
7354000	7355000	To the ankle.
7355000	7356000	Fuck your mama so hard.
7356000	7357000	She got a cankle.
7357000	7358000	It's stupid.
7358000	7359000	Because it rhymes with ankle because it's a derivative of the word ankle.
7359000	7360000	It works.
7360000	7361000	Chin to the knee.
7361000	7362000	To the thigh.
7362000	7363000	Fuck your mama so hard.
7363000	7364000	She was strong.
7364000	7365000	Sorry.
7365000	7366000	Okay.
7366000	7367000	All right.
7367000	7368000	Yo.
7368000	7369000	Yo.
7369000	7370000	The show ended in like 10 minutes.
7370000	7371000	All right.
7371000	7372000	Okay.
7372000	7373000	Here's the thing.
7373000	7379000	When you drive home, take a partner.
7379000	7380000	Don't get bugged.
7380000	7381000	Don't get stabbed.
7381000	7382000	That's all we need to say.
7382000	7383000	That's good advice.
7383000	7386000	Don't get bugged on the way home.
7386000	7391000	When you get home, check all your soft tissues.
7391000	7392000	Breast testicles for issues.
7392000	7393000	They could have lumps.
7393000	7394000	You go out.
7394000	7395000	You gotta check that shit.
7395000	7396000	Okay.
7396000	7397000	Check yourself.
7397000	7404000	Even though you think you're too young to get the numbers.
7404000	7411000	One and two kinds of cancer.
7411000	7419000	We can detect him early by checking your little bits in the shower.
7419000	7424000	I know when I take a shower and I wash my nuts.
7424000	7430000	It jiggles them and I spend the rest of the night going, do I have nut cancer?
7430000	7432000	One or two types of cancer.
7432000	7433000	No.
7433000	7434000	Yo.
7434000	7435000	Here's the thing.
7435000	7436000	Okay.
7436000	7437000	One or two types of cancer.
7437000	7438000	Secret track.
7438000	7439000	Secret track.
7439000	7442000	If you advertise during the show, the show, you don't care about that.
7442000	7443000	Here we go.
7443000	7444000	Yeah.
7444000	7446000	Threw a star door into the unknown.
7446000	7448000	Threw an intestinal tract of the cosmology.
7448000	7452000	I'm gonna show you some truths that you never knew to be.
7452000	7461000	There is a planet called rhythm.
7461000	7463000	I'm serious.
7463000	7465000	There's a planet called rhythm.
7465000	7466000	I'm serious.
7466000	7468000	It's also 86 miles in diameter.
7468000	7470000	It has its own atmosphere.
7470000	7473000	It grows silicon mostly on trees.
7473000	7475000	It has a heavy color.
7475000	7477000	The center of the planet is oil.
7477000	7481000	If we go there, there's only a semi-sentient species.
7481000	7483000	We can easily fill them.
7483000	7487000	It would be enough oil to power our whole planet.
7487000	7489000	We just need to launch one missile.
7489000	7493000	But it'll cost 87 trillion dollars.
7493000	7495000	Think about it.
7495000	7496000	Wow.
7496000	7499000	There you go.
7499000	7500000	Drive safe.
7500000	7502000	Drive fast and take chances.
7502000	7507000	Well, my name is John and I'm here to say I've got a shirt and some pants today.
7507000	7510000	I'm doing after the show in this way.
7510000	7512000	My name is John and my rap goes this way.
7512000	7515000	I put a left foot forward, a right foot back.
7515000	7517000	And then I look like I'm on a Nordic track.
7517000	7520000	I'm gonna run from a side like a hieroglyphic.
7520000	7523000	I fucked your mama so hard the bitch seems sad.
7523000	7525000	It's so philitic.
7525000	7529000	But that's on me, isn't it?
7529000	7533000	It's weird to blame her for the STD I gave her.
7533000	7534000	I live in a pyramid.
7534000	7536000	My name is Tom.
7536000	7542000	I'm gonna live here for a million years.
7542000	7548000	If you look under your seat and you have a yellow sticker, you get a free car.
7548000	7549000	Look under your seats.
7549000	7550000	Nope.
7550000	7551000	Nope.
7551000	7552000	Nope.
7552000	7553000	Nope.
7553000	7554000	Nope.
7554000	7555000	Happy Halloween.
7555000	7556000	Happy New Year.
7556000	7563000	Fuck your mama for a beer.
7563000	7564000	The world's an illusion.
7564000	7565000	The Matrix is real.
7565000	7568000	If you go, your favorite band is Seal.
7568000	7570000	You don't know what you're doing.
7570000	7583000	You're part of the illusion.
7583000	7585000	Reptile people run the Federal Reserve.
7585000	7589000	They control the interest rates to make the world curve to its ends.
7589000	7590000	The New World Order.
7590000	7591000	Holy fuck.
7591000	7596000	Don't take a border if their shape starts to shift and they say, what's the rent?
7596000	7599000	You turn them away and say, you're a reptile.
7599000	7601000	There's a war coming.
7601000	7602000	Dig a hole in your backyard.
7602000	7603000	A war coming.
7603000	7604000	Reptile people.
7604000	7605000	Don't let them left the reptiles.
7605000	7606000	He's one of them.
7606000	7607000	Yeah.
7607000	7608000	Fuck them.
7608000	7609000	Try it safely.
7609000	7612000	But they ran again in a troop.
