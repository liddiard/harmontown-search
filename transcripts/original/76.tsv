0	20760	Welcome all to Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics and the Nerd Melt Theater.
20760	21760	Thank you so much for coming.
21760	24880	Give yourselves a warm, warm grace.
24880	32400	We've been off for a week and we have a very large crowd here tonight.
32400	33400	It's very exciting.
33400	40760	Can you please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
40760	44920	Thank you.
44920	49280	Thank you.
49280	51240	Thank you.
51240	52240	Thank you.
52240	54120	Probably a special night for some of you.
54120	57120	I think some people are probably here out of town for Communicon.
57120	62640	Oh, that's what this is all about.
62640	63640	Yeah.
63640	67200	Makes you wonder, would there just be 12 people here if it weren't for that?
67200	72720	We usually have a healthy sized crowd, but certainly, yeah, a lot of people are here.
72720	77400	Communicon was our second year of having a community convention over at the Embassy Suites
77400	78600	in Glendale.
78600	79600	Not our second year there.
80600	91320	Do you think that you guys are on pace for six seasons?
91320	98920	Well, I mean, as much as we were first season, everybody always asks that, like, do you think
98920	101320	you guys, don't you think this and don't you think that?
101320	106800	It's like, this show has been on the chopping block since its first episode.
107600	111320	At what point do you just throw up your hands and go, obviously, it's going to be on the
111320	114680	air for 20 years or can die at any time?
114680	116320	You just kind of embrace it.
116320	120320	It's the show represents the human condition.
120320	127000	It's kind of a weird mud skipper of a show because it's ... You wonder, like, just put
127000	134040	yourself in the mind of Donald Glover, who's incredibly talented, who rang his soul dry
134040	136280	into that show.
137280	141600	I definitely know that he did not leave because he thought, oh, I'm going to go make a bunch
141600	142600	of money.
142600	148400	But a kid like Donald, as talented as Donald was, and for the amount of work that he did
148400	158040	on that show, 15 years earlier, can you imagine, he would have left the set of community at
158040	163000	the end of an episode taping in season two and he would have gone out to the parking
163000	169720	lot and a Sony exec would have been like, Donald, hey, and there would have been a Porsche.
169720	170720	Just want to let you know.
170720	171720	Your contract's up for renewal.
171720	172720	Here you go.
172720	176440	The shit changed.
176440	178760	The climate changed.
178760	179760	What was my point?
179760	180760	I don't know.
180760	185760	Well, I mean, community, to make it into your fifth season is fucking hard.
185760	190920	To make it into your fifth season, now you just do it crawling on your belly over glass.
190920	194680	Now you just do it, you make it to the end of the fifth season and at the end of it,
194680	197920	people are just going like, yeah, you're welcome.
197920	200040	No, nobody.
200040	201040	There's no ticker tape.
201040	204040	There's no, except for these kids.
204040	205040	There's ticker tape from them.
205040	209400	But like you say, back in the old days, and I don't mean to sound corny, but really before
209400	220600	9-11, when your show made it, that's the first time the use of 9-11 has been characterized
220600	221600	as corny.
221600	226600	I don't hear you say it in old-fashioned.
226600	227600	Corny.
227600	228600	Oh, that old chestnut.
228600	239840	But there was a time when there was a thing called holding deals.
239840	244400	Like you say, actors got like a half a million dollars to not work, just so they were stuck
244400	246640	to a network or a studio.
246640	251960	And also, like when ER got picked up for the second season, all the cast walked out
251960	254520	and they all had brand new Porsches, like you say.
254520	255800	Do any shows get that?
255800	257720	Does like Big Bang Theory get the cars?
257720	262680	Well, I'm sure Big Bang Theory gets all, yeah, I mean, that's an actual profitable,
262680	265800	like actual thing.
265800	266800	I don't know.
266800	269080	You'd have to, I mean, we should have Bill Prady on.
269080	274680	He's the showrunner for Big Bang Theory and ostensibly my nemesis.
274680	279360	But we like each other and I should have him come up here to talk about what it's like
279360	283640	to run Big Bang Theory because I'm constantly cursing it like the Red Baron.
283640	289680	But it would be interesting to know what it's like to work over there.
289680	292160	And I know, yeah, I have no idea.
292160	294440	I'd be speaking way outside my jurisdiction.
294440	301280	I just know that in general, you know, God, there was, you know, when I was a kid watching
301280	304040	TV, there was three networks.
304040	305040	Just three.
305040	309600	And then there was your local UHF station with some Yahoo like Jim Henson doing some
309600	315200	weird shit on it because he hit the bricks with a suitcase full of tapes of Kermit the
315200	318080	Frog and said, can we do this syndicated?
318080	323000	But there was three networks and those three networks basically cooperated.
323000	328560	So there was like Battle of the Network Stars with Scott Baio fighting the Hulk and a Highwire.
328560	330560	Everything was just a big fuck you to the consumer.
330560	332760	It was like, what are you going to take your business elsewhere?
332760	339080	It's a talking car plus the chicks hot fuck off, which also created the classic television.
339080	343320	I miss Sherwood Schwartz and Gilligan's Island because that motherfucker didn't care what
343320	344320	he needed to do.
344320	346120	He wanted you to watch that show.
346120	347120	Right.
347120	348680	The Harlem Globetrotters are on the island tonight.
348680	350240	Well, that's an interesting thing.
350240	351240	That's good.
351240	356280	In the age of the three networks, you had Mary Tyler Moore, who created this like this
356280	362440	collective of creatives that, you know, the little kitty cat that said MTM, that's Mary
362440	368760	Tyler Moore, who like Charlie Chaplin before her, like created a collective of artists.
368760	371880	Her whole goal was to say, we're the creatives.
371880	375800	We need to be able to swing a heavier dick than these rich people who just pay to do
375800	377480	nothing.
377480	384960	And at the same time as her, Norman Lear, who like the time of total monopolization,
384960	389680	there was more conscientiousness, more creative passion on the part of some of these people.
389680	391440	That's the odd thing.
391440	397480	But the fragmentation of all this media, you would not be able to have a Breaking Bad on
397480	402280	network TV in 1980, obviously, for obvious reasons, because there's 25 million people
402280	407120	watching and possibly if you're the lowest rating show, the rated show.
407120	411640	So there's no way anyone's going to green light Breaking Bad in 1980.
411640	412640	So you get...
412640	413640	Who cares?
413640	414800	Let's move on to something else.
414800	417960	I took a poop the other day.
417960	418960	Go on.
418960	420800	You want to know about TV?
420800	421800	Google TV.
421800	422800	Jesus Christ.
422800	425280	I'm sure there's just stuff on the Internet about TV.
425280	427440	What am I talking about?
427440	430800	Big jackass talking about TV.
430800	433480	I took the biggest poop.
433480	436560	You cannot find that on Google.
436560	437560	I don't care.
437560	438800	You can Google it all you want.
438800	439800	Big poop.
439800	440800	I didn't really take a big poop.
440800	441800	I was kidding.
442800	445800	Don't tease us like that, man.
445800	450040	You know, I was kind of interested in doing because it was the first time that the community
450040	451040	fans are here.
451040	456640	I don't doubt that a lot of Harmontown attendees are probably, I don't kid myself, I'm sure
456640	458600	the only reason they're here is because they watch community.
458600	461400	But at the same time, there is a division.
461400	465440	There's like a, you know, there's Harmontown fans and there's community fans.
465440	469880	There's a big old Venn diagram cleavage in the middle.
469880	471520	But there's also separation.
471520	477080	Like a huge community fan, arguably the biggest community fan in the world, would have a huge
477080	479240	reason to be like, fuck Dan Harmon.
479240	480240	Fuck that guy.
480240	485320	And I would, you know, every once in a while I open my mouth and I say something in a sub
485320	487840	comment of this comment section on Reddit.
487840	492200	Like for instance, I care about my show and I think it's stupid when people tell me it
492200	495880	sucks and they can eat poop and fuck off and die.
495880	499080	And here's how that makes me feel because I'm a human being that has a heartbeat and
499080	504760	is going to die one day and doesn't want to go to my god liar.
504760	510080	And then everything's fine in that subreddit and it seems perfectly fine and then someone
510080	525040	goes like, if I reprinted this in my dumb ass blog, I could get like a million pennies.
525040	527240	And then it all gets out of control.
527240	533480	The end result is always that there's a lot of community fans, I think, and I know because
533480	541880	I see on Twitter, they literally will go, he needs to stop talking.
541880	544840	What percentage of the feedback is that?
544840	545840	I don't know.
545840	546840	What does Twitter represent?
546840	551040	What are the community fans represent?
551040	554400	Is our top community fan?
554400	562760	That was a quote from, from, from, I can't pronounce her Twitter name.
562760	563760	Is she here?
563760	567880	Wait, the stop talking lady is here?
567880	569040	The stop talking lady is here.
569040	573040	He needs to stop talking.
573040	578520	Why would you come to this show?
578520	581240	That's all it is.
581240	583240	That's what I was.
583240	587360	Would you be willing to come up and talk about how I shouldn't?
587360	599600	If we're going to have this conversation, you have to come up on stage.
599600	604360	Stop talking lady.
604360	610400	Yeah, you can grab one of those.
610400	612080	She just walked up and said, what should we talk about?
612080	615480	What's your name by the way?
615480	616480	Lisa.
616480	617480	Hello, Lisa.
617480	619720	You look very, very contentious right now.
619720	623240	She's got arms akimbo like a fight's about to break out.
623240	626360	Can I just say something really quick?
626360	631040	Lisa is responsible for getting season five.
631040	633080	She's a winner.
633080	634280	Can you come up and explain that?
634280	637520	Get up here.
637520	640520	What is going on?
640520	648080	And by the way, can we start doing the show on the round because it would be so much easier
648080	649880	just to have the surrounded by people.
649880	653800	The access to the stage would be so much simpler because now the whole show is people just
653800	655960	storming the stage like the best deal.
655960	659800	I was like, I'm divided up.
659800	664320	Hey, lady, I did not create a show.
664320	666120	You do not get to tell me to stop talking.
666120	667120	All right.
667120	669240	So what do you address first?
669240	672160	What's your name, Robin to her Batman?
672160	673160	I'm Catherine.
673160	674160	Catherine.
674160	675160	Hello Catherine.
675160	676160	I'm violin Catherine on Twitter.
676160	677160	I guess you can pronounce that.
677160	679200	I didn't ask, but thank you.
679200	685360	And you guys were principally like you coordinated Communicon, right?
685360	686360	She did.
686360	687360	Right.
687360	698080	All right, so what the concept, okay.
698080	702560	Why do I need to stop talking?
702560	707200	In three words or less.
707200	710760	I thought that you were hurting yourself and you were hurting the fans.
710760	716200	I didn't say you should stop talking because I think, well, I did say you should stop talking.
716200	717200	You literally did.
717200	721680	But in the context, I'm sorry, I should I eat my mic?
721680	722680	Eat your mic.
722680	723680	In the context.
723680	724680	Yeah.
724680	726680	I'm talking to the mic.
726680	727680	Okay.
727680	730920	There is a danger that when you say things into this, that it will end up reflecting
730920	734400	poorly on you.
734400	735400	That's true.
735400	738800	But I really didn't think that you would go so far as to have me up here.
738800	739800	So I'm glad.
739800	740800	I'm glad to have the chance.
740800	741800	Is this punishment?
741800	742800	I don't know.
742800	744040	Do you not want to be up here?
744040	748960	Well, you don't like feeling like you're under attack, so I don't particularly like it myself
748960	749960	either.
749960	750960	Okay.
750960	752120	So you don't want to be up here?
752120	753120	Oh, I see where you're going.
753120	754120	I see where you're going.
755120	759120	What kind of fucking jujitsu is going on?
759120	760120	Damn.
760120	764080	If she doesn't stay up here, I will stay up here and defend her.
764080	766760	Well, I don't doubt that.
766760	769120	There's a lot of energy coming from this concept.
769120	772400	You understand why I would want you to come up here so that we can have it out so that
772400	776640	we can be on honest ground so that tonight, everyone, whether they love community, hate
776640	779840	community, don't give a shit about community, love me, hate me, don't give a shit about
779840	786160	me, we can all go home tonight and go to fucking sleep and wake up in an honest world.
786160	788200	Why should I stop talking?
788200	789200	Okay.
789200	793280	Yes, it is great that you cared, and I love that you care, and I think you're brilliant,
793280	797240	and I think that the show is obviously wonderful or I wouldn't be here, I've spent all the
797240	798640	money to get here.
798640	803120	When I read the comments, and I'm not the only person who said this, Stan, is that not
803120	807700	that you should stop talking, but you let them bait you to the point where it distracts
807700	812900	people from wanting to enjoy the show, new fans, people who don't know you, people who
812900	818060	don't know that this is your persona or who you are, and they say, who the hell is Dan
818060	819060	Harmon?
819060	820060	I don't like to see that happen.
820060	822220	I'm so happy that you're back.
822220	824900	I am over the moon happy that you're back.
824900	829340	I wouldn't have put all the time and passion into doing what I do online to get people
829340	833060	to watch the show and to love the show if I didn't care.
833060	836900	So when I hear you say those things, I don't think you shouldn't say them, and people said
836900	840780	to me, you should come and see him at Communicon, you should come see him in Harmon Town and
840780	842780	see what he's really like as a person.
842780	845260	He's not done such a shit quote that was in Vulture.
845260	848980	And I said, yeah, I'm going to do that because I saw your response to me the other day, and
848980	849980	it hurt.
849980	852260	And I said, all right, I see his point.
852260	858700	It hurt you for me to be defensive and express my pain.
858700	859700	What was your response, Dan?
859700	860700	Sorry?
860700	861700	What was the response?
861700	864660	She said that she was going to come to the show and I said, maybe the topic of the show
864660	867100	should be how I should stop talking.
867100	868100	That hurt you?
868100	869100	Well, no.
869100	870100	OK.
870100	874020	It didn't hurt me in the sense that my feelings were hurt.
874020	879020	I realized, like many people do, that on Twitter, the things that you say can come back and
879020	883020	bite you, just like the things that you say on a subreddit came back and bit you, and
883020	885060	you felt like you needed to respond to it.
885060	888260	And that's why I didn't respond to that because, you know what, the dude is right.
888260	889500	It's his show.
889500	892540	And I am sitting here saying that he should stop talking.
892540	898420	I meant in terms of, and I'm sorry, I'm a little bit going to be rounding, going around
898420	901340	and sounding like I don't quite know what I mean because it's complicated.
901340	903140	You're a complicated person.
903140	908100	I find the whole concept of trying to understand where you're coming from as a person to be
908100	909500	something that I wrestle with.
909500	914500	But I also tell everyone that I think you're a total genius and that the show wouldn't
914500	916020	be the same without you.
916020	918340	We all know what season four was like.
918340	919940	And that's also why it hurts.
919940	920940	What do you mean?
921940	922940	Okay.
922940	924940	What on earth do you mean?
924940	925940	Okay.
925940	927940	Get those camera phones out, everybody.
927940	928940	Please.
928940	929940	Hit record right now.
929940	933540	Please tell Vulture and Dafamer and TMZ what you mean by that.
933540	935300	Please tell the AV Club what you mean.
935300	937940	Say anything after the word season four.
937940	940460	Say anything.
940460	945420	Say season four, I like Arby's, and see how they twist it.
945420	948420	And you didn't even create the show.
949220	952940	There's a lot of energy on that topic.
952940	953940	It's tough sometimes.
953940	960220	Lisa, can I ... I'm coming at this from a very ... from the back row here, but it sounds
960220	963180	to me like you love the show, obviously.
963180	965020	You really love Community.
965020	966620	And there's two different things here.
966620	971100	There's Dan Harmon, the guy, and then there's the show that Dan created.
971100	975460	And do you feel that you like Dan a little bit less than you like the show?
975460	979180	Do you worry that Dan has the capacity to hurt the thing that you care about?
979180	980180	Which is good.
980180	982300	No, I'm not trying to be flippant.
982300	986460	You feel like Dan has the capacity to actually be destructive to the thing that you care
986460	987460	about more, right?
987460	988460	Community?
988460	989460	Am I getting that wrong?
989460	990460	Yes and no.
990460	994940	It's possible if Paul Newman makes salad dressing, and then Paul Newman is in the paper
994940	997900	going like, I hate women.
997900	1000460	It could hurt salad dressing sales.
1000460	1001460	That is the ...
1001460	1002460	It could hurt his salad dressing sales.
1002460	1003460	Sure.
1003460	1007220	Yes, not all salad dressing sales.
1007220	1011100	It might actually cause a spike in the Hidden Valley Ranch, yes.
1011100	1012500	That's what I'm saying.
1012500	1017100	His salad dressing sales, yes, would be harmed by him saying something like that.
1017100	1021780	So you're looking at me as like a Colonel Sanders or like a Ronald McDonald, which I
1021780	1028300	am in relation to community when it says ... Because those articles say, community creator lashes
1028300	1032020	out at rape victims.
1032020	1034220	Tells what happens to them.
1034220	1036180	Thinks it's hilarious.
1036180	1038500	Created community.
1038500	1042100	Do you think you should watch it on Thursday?
1042100	1046940	That's what those headlines do, and so as a fan you're like, oh, God damn it, I'm trying
1046940	1052500	so hard just to get people to mobilize and watch the show and get that 1.2 up to a 1.3
1052500	1054500	and he's undermining me.
1054500	1059420	Paul Newman is undermining my pro salad dressing campaign.
1059420	1061820	You're frowning like you disagree with anything I'm saying.
1062620	1064820	That's my best guess at what you're going through.
1064820	1066780	No, I don't think you're undermining me.
1066780	1070820	I worry about people hearing that and thinking that you're a dick and that they don't want
1070820	1071820	to watch the show.
1071820	1072820	Right.
1072820	1073820	That's what I just said.
1073820	1074820	Okay.
1074820	1075820	Yeah, no, but you're saying they sound like they're undermining me.
1075820	1077820	They're not undermining me.
1077820	1080940	It seems like there's two people that hate each other on stage, but you don't.
1080940	1086260	You love ... How do you feel about Dan Harmon, the individual?
1086260	1087260	I don't hate you.
1087260	1090260	Why would I hate you?
1090260	1091260	Wow.
1092260	1095260	I'm really confused.
1095260	1096260	There's two people on stage.
1096260	1104260	One of them does not like being told not to talk.
1104260	1105260	That's me for sure.
1105260	1106260	I'll own up to that.
1106260	1113260	Sounds like that's also how you feel because a mere reply to your tweet hurt your feelings.
1113260	1117260	You said something and I responded to it and it hurt your feelings.
1117260	1119260	Let me rephrase.
1119260	1122260	Being brought up here feels like an attack.
1122260	1127260	Are you making responses to the things that you say make you feel like a bad person?
1127260	1128260	You feel under scrutiny.
1128260	1130260	You feel like you're under a microscope.
1130260	1133260	You feel like people want you to be different.
1133260	1136260	Kevin, you have a microphone in your hand.
1136260	1138260	Just start talking into the mic.
1138260	1140260	Lisa, can I just ... I have to ...
1140260	1141260	No, no, no.
1141260	1143260	I really want you to ...
1143260	1144260	Let her talk.
1144260	1145260	After ...
1145260	1146260	What's that?
1147260	1148260	I'm just ...
1148260	1152260	Lisa, Lisa, what I'm assuming is a friend of yours is on stage.
1152260	1155260	Jeff, you know, I would like to just ...
1155260	1156260	No, I won't.
1156260	1157260	It's 60 seconds.
1157260	1158260	We've only come out.
1158260	1159260	No.
1159260	1160260	Hey, hey, hey, hey.
1160260	1161260	Lisa.
1161260	1162260	I'm Comptroller.
1162260	1163260	Shut up.
1163260	1165260	Catherine, go ahead.
1165260	1166260	You have to conch.
1166260	1167260	All right.
1167260	1168260	Dan.
1168260	1169260	No.
1169260	1170260	60 seconds.
1170260	1171260	Let me talk.
1171260	1173260	If you take the mic back, let me talk.
1173260	1175260	She really doesn't like people to talk.
1175260	1181260	I mean, two dots draws a segment and it's almost a line, man.
1181260	1182260	There you go.
1182260	1183260	She tried to get me.
1183260	1184260	All right.
1184260	1190260	Dan, we've worked our butts off on Twitter for season four, which ... Okay, whatever.
1190260	1193260	Season five, looking at season six.
1193260	1200260	This girl spent day and night with Mike in Canada to get season five.
1200260	1204260	I don't want her to get pissed off and quit right now.
1204260	1205260	There's a reality.
1205260	1206260	Okay, I love you.
1206260	1207260	I'm just saying it.
1207260	1208260	I need to stand up for you right now.
1208260	1216780	The other thing is, okay, as an AV club member on that 160,000 comment board, we love you
1216780	1221180	and we want you to come hang out with us and it's sad ... Okay, you can go to Reddit and
1221180	1225540	be nice to them, but you're going to attack a community fan leader and then you're going
1225540	1227620	to go and shun the AV club.
1227620	1232340	I'm just personally ... Go to the people who love you and come back and be like, okay,
1232340	1237220	put on earth instead of just coming back hard because we do love you.
1237220	1240500	There's so much back story and underlying stuff to this that's so confusing to people
1240500	1241500	though.
1241500	1242500	That's what I'm saying.
1242500	1244700	When I wake up in the morning, here's what I do.
1244700	1247460	I wake up and I go, my name is Dan Harmon.
1247460	1248940	I am going to think things.
1248940	1253000	They're going to drop down out of my brain by gravity and come out of my mouth.
1253000	1255580	Some of this stuff is going to go through my fingers because I won't have time to say
1255580	1258540	everything and end up being a TV show if I'm lucky.
1258540	1261300	I've been doing that for 40 years and counting.
1261300	1263780	That's how I operate every given day.
1263780	1267620	Then this wonderful thing called the internet, which doesn't demand eye contact from me.
1267620	1270140	I get to go in and I love going in.
1270140	1271340	I was born on the internet.
1271340	1276580	I go in and somebody says to me, hey, Dan, what does it feel like to write that show?
1276580	1277860	I go, you know what?
1277860	1281220	Sometimes it feels like a penguin fucking a moose.
1281220	1289460	Only recently, the weird flash in the pan, it's worth money to print a headline that
1290460	1295740	community creator says penguins fuck mooses and that has something to do with the thing.
1295740	1299060	That's an issue that we all are experiencing, all of us.
1299060	1304980	When we experience it, it's a bummer for me, but here's how I handle it.
1304980	1307500	I go, oh fuck, that sucks.
1307500	1309540	You go, oh fuck, that sucks.
1309540	1311220	You go, that sucks.
1311220	1318580	We all go to bed, but I don't say to anybody, even defamer vulture anybody.
1318580	1323300	I never say, someone's got to stop doing something that they've been doing.
1323300	1328340	I go to bed, I wake up and I keep doing it and I experience pain because of it, just
1328340	1333180	like I did on the playground, just like all the characters in community are constantly
1333180	1334860	being punished for who they are.
1334860	1339740	The outside world closes in on you as you express your humanity.
1339740	1344020	It's an important theme of the show and it's run by a psychopath.
1344020	1348980	It's run by somebody who just goes, blah, blah, blah.
1348980	1350500	I'm bummed out.
1350500	1357540	I'm a little baby, a little poopy pants baby about the idea of being told to shut up and
1357540	1359260	what I should and shouldn't do.
1359260	1362140	It's like a big issue with me.
1362140	1364620	I didn't go off on you or anything.
1364620	1371100	I tweeted back at you, a defensive, I rolled over, exposed my belly to you.
1371100	1372340	Do I get to jump in now?
1372340	1373340	Yeah, sorry.
1373340	1374980	I didn't mean to cut you off.
1374980	1381820	Look, you tweeted back at me and it gave me pause and I talked to my friends, most of
1381820	1387100	whom are here tonight, who all said, you know what, Dan does run off at the mouth.
1387100	1391460	He doesn't mean anything bad to people about, he's not trying to hurt anyone.
1391460	1393100	Maybe he's hurting himself.
1393100	1395220	Maybe you should think twice about what you said.
1395220	1400300	Maybe you should go to Harmon Town, see what he's really like, came to see you at Communicon,
1400300	1401460	came away from that thinking.
1401460	1406300	I can see why he's such a powerful figure and why people like him so much.
1406300	1407780	It's interesting to hear you talk.
1407780	1413180	I was hearing those sound bites out of Vulture like that you're complaining about and I responded
1413180	1416620	it thinking, here's a man who makes a show I admire.
1416620	1420500	Here's a show that I really want to succeed in season five.
1420500	1421940	I'd like to see more.
1421940	1427380	I wish he would stop talking because it just makes him look bad and I don't want you to
1427380	1428380	look bad.
1428380	1433220	If that's bad and if that puts me stupid or I'm attacking you or I don't even know
1433220	1439780	exactly what we're getting at right now because I'm like, my head is, my head is swirling
1439780	1444380	a little bit because I'm being, no, it's tough up here, yes, and I choose to be up here because
1444380	1447380	I'm self-destructive.
1447380	1452900	Just to respond to that, I mean, did you watch the Sarah Silverman program?
1452900	1454820	I got fired from that.
1454820	1457500	I got fired from every job I had in Milwaukee.
1457500	1462620	You caught me at a normal time in my life.
1462620	1466280	I have been getting fired my entire life.
1466280	1470780	Everybody that I work for eventually goes, did I like the Sarah Silverman program?
1470780	1471780	No.
1471780	1472780	Did I like?
1472780	1475820	I, it's a bummer to me.
1475820	1479300	I wish that I could be who I was and constantly get promoted.
1479300	1486260	That would be great if people gave me cakes all the time instead of firing me, I guess.
1486260	1491540	But the truth is, the way that they respond to who I am is they fire me.
1491540	1496140	But at the same time, I like my life.
1496140	1497740	I like the way things are going.
1497740	1501460	I got a hybrid.
1501460	1502460	I got a golden doodle.
1502460	1506460	I got a redhead girlfriend.
1506460	1515980	In that order.
1516700	1520860	But the thing that we're talking about, this is why I wanted to bring you up.
1520860	1521860	You're like me.
1521860	1529540	As soon as somebody's talking about what you're saying, I'm feeling what you're feeling when
1529540	1533580	we come up here and talk about this.
1533580	1540380	That's why, here's the thing that I have found, but here's the thing that I have found.
1540380	1546260	When the autonomic response slowly fades down, when we talk about it for 10 minutes longer
1546260	1552380	than people usually talk about it, and this show does everything 10 minutes longer, this
1552380	1554540	miracle starts to happen.
1554540	1561020	I'll tell you why this show exists and why my Myspace blog exists and why everything
1561020	1565540	that I've ever done that has gotten me in trouble exists, why there's a letter online
1565540	1569300	that I wrote to an eight-year-old kid about Steven Spielberg being a hack because I didn't
1569300	1576260	like Monster House enough, why I'm famous before that for saying that my Kung Fu Panda
1576260	1578420	sucked and all this shit.
1578420	1583940	Every fucking job I've ever worked at, there's always this thing that comes up and I go like,
1583940	1585740	I'm an asshole.
1585740	1590020	I say this shit that gets me in trouble.
1590020	1593100	Here's another thing that has always happened.
1593100	1602220	When I first came out to L.A., I was working for Ben Stiller and it was a just happenstance.
1602220	1606060	All of a sudden, I'm working for this famous guy, Ben Stiller, and we were going to have
1606060	1613660	a party in our place in Koreatown and I was going to invite him over and Rob Sharp said,
1613660	1618220	you know, you should probably leave a funny message on his message machine.
1618220	1621260	We had machines back then.
1621340	1630740	So I practiced funny message and I ran it through my head a couple times and I dialed
1630740	1634780	his number and I left, I tried to leave a funny message on his machine and I kind of
1634780	1640980	fucked it up and I had to call back because I forgot to leave my contact info.
1640980	1645180	It was a horrible experience that I walked away from because, of course, he never showed
1645180	1648420	up for the party.
1648420	1652980	I had so much shame about it locked down in my body that three years later, I would
1652980	1657540	open my refrigerator to make a sandwich in the privacy of my own home and the color of
1657540	1662860	the mustard bottle would somehow remind me of the time I left a fucking shitty funny
1662860	1667900	message on Ben Stiller's voicemail.
1667900	1672980	There was this tipping point where I said, I got to stop making this my problem and I
1672980	1677980	went over to my computer and I typed up the story of how I left a funny message on Ben
1677980	1682940	Stiller's answering machine and I clicked submit on it and it was a blog entry and there
1682940	1684740	was no guarantee that anyone was going to read it.
1684740	1688660	It was just a message in a bottle that I whipped out into the ocean and it was gone.
1688660	1692700	It was out of my heart and everybody in this room, everybody on this planet is walking
1692700	1698220	around with all this shit that we do that is shameful and all this rage that we have
1698220	1704060	and all these sexual perversions and we collect them and we bottle them up and I don't think
1704060	1708660	it's a good idea for everybody to barf them onto each other, but I know that I would go
1708660	1716380	insane and that I would be a toxic, horrible Portuguese man o'war, half dead on the beach.
1716380	1722700	TMZ had like, Dan Harmon lashes out at the Portuguese.
1722700	1723700	And jellyfish.
1723700	1726700	I would be filled with toxicity if I didn't like put it out.
1726700	1729260	The weird thing about putting it out is it doesn't poison other people.
1729260	1730620	It turns into comedy.
1730620	1734460	It turns into things that they can, it feels cathartic to them.
1734460	1739500	A lot of people basically just say, oh, if that dumb fat piece of shit, petty asshole
1739500	1744940	can get up there and be honest about being a big fucking dumb shithead, maybe I wasn't
1744940	1748220	doing something so wrong my whole life.
1748220	1754100	And so I do that stuff and I'm going to keep doing it and the whole time I'm like very
1754100	1759220	defensive about the idea of being like, I feel that pressure.
1759220	1761080	comedy was a new chapter in my life.
1761080	1763100	It was this plot point that happened to me.
1763100	1769220	I stumbled into this job of being able to actually affect people and being the Colonel
1769220	1774060	Sanders of this, of this thing and it was like 15 year old girls following me on Twitter
1774060	1782260	and me having to go, I can't tweet about jerking off anymore.
1782260	1786120	I could, but it doesn't feel right.
1786120	1791720	They're only following me because Joel McHale follows me like, it's a 15 year old girl.
1791720	1797240	I don't, like you start to ask yourself who you are, what you have a right to say.
1797240	1800160	And it only constricts in from there.
1800160	1808980	It, I forgot my point a long time ago, but that's where I come from and my point of bringing
1808980	1811640	you up here was absolutely not.
1811640	1816640	I knew, I knew that if I did, I knew that there would be on both of our parts.
1816640	1817640	My cheeks got hot.
1817640	1819080	My ears got hot.
1819080	1822840	I knew that that would happen, but I didn't want it to happen.
1822840	1824940	I knew it would have disastrous results.
1824940	1825940	Probably tomorrow.
1825940	1830280	It's probably too late to prevent that because that because it's a juicier story and whatever,
1830280	1831580	whatever happened right away.
1831580	1837600	But I also knew that something would be resolved, that something would go, just finish it.
1837600	1840200	Just be done with it.
1840200	1846720	Some of you guys love a television show so much that the guy that created it is an obstacle
1846720	1848520	in its path.
1848520	1851120	And I think that's a beautiful thing, but it's an obstacle.
1851120	1853120	It's not going to go away.
1853120	1857680	I don't, I'm not cueing that applause.
1857680	1862800	It's going to sound like Dan Harmon brings up a community fan in a fucking dog fight
1862800	1868280	pit and makes them applaud him saying he's a hero.
1868280	1873240	I anticipated everybody in the audience being a communicon attendee, that's why I wanted
1873240	1874240	to talk about this.
1874240	1876640	I wanted to just be more apology and atonement than anything.
1876640	1881480	I wanted to explain to you guys without promising that I'm going to change because I'm not going
1881480	1882480	to.
1882480	1889240	I wanted to somehow explain to you guys that this is who I am so he doesn't need to stop
1889240	1890240	talking.
1890240	1891240	Lisa, use your mic.
1891240	1892240	There's no way.
1892240	1893240	Microphone, Lisa.
1893240	1894240	Oh, sorry.
1895240	1896240	Eat the mic.
1896240	1898240	There's no way for me out of this conversation.
1898240	1903080	So yeah, I know you could be human and then you want me to apologize.
1903080	1904080	Yes.
1904080	1905080	Yes.
1905080	1909120	Like tell me your feelings, feelings, you, your feelings, not don't talk about Lisa,
1909120	1910120	Lisa.
1910120	1911120	What's on?
1911120	1912680	I mean, again, I'm not trying to poke her pride here.
1912680	1915480	Like what's, what's unresolved for you in this because you still seem pretty wound up
1915480	1916480	about it.
1916480	1917480	Like what's, what's the unresolved issue?
1917480	1918480	Well, how do I seem on top of that?
1918480	1919480	I haven't said anything.
1919480	1920480	Use your microphone.
1920480	1926200	I'm not sure what you want from me.
1926200	1927200	Yes.
1927200	1928200	I'm sorry.
1928200	1931240	I just had a throwaway comment to you that made you upset and made you feel like you
1931240	1932240	had to go.
1932240	1933240	But it's symbolic of a larger thing.
1933240	1934960	There's a big sea of magma under there.
1934960	1935960	Yeah.
1935960	1936960	The fandom.
1936960	1937960	Like there's.
1937960	1940400	So am I here as an example for all.
1940400	1941400	Probably right.
1941400	1942400	No.
1942400	1943400	I don't know.
1943400	1944400	Am I?
1944400	1948320	Do you not want to speak for fandoms like frustration with my PR can't speak for anyone
1948320	1949320	but myself.
1949560	1950560	Well, okay.
1950560	1955160	Then talk about like, like you have you said that then like how you feel.
1955160	1959640	I think I've already explained twice now that I said that and I've talked to people about
1959640	1962320	it and they said, find out who he really is.
1962320	1966440	And now I feel like I really have found out who you are and I'm not going to worry about
1966440	1967440	it anymore.
1967440	1968440	You can say whatever you want.
1968440	1969440	We did it.
1969440	1970440	We did it.
1970440	1971440	We did it.
1971440	1972440	Lisa and Catherine, everybody.
1972440	1973440	Thank you so much.
1973440	1973440	
1979560	1980560	Good job.
1984480	1985920	There was a thing about season five, too.
1985920	1987120	Thank you for season five.
1995360	1996360	I felt that was healthy.
1998160	1999360	I felt like that for a little bit.
2001240	2002240	All right.
2003000	2004560	Let's bring Spencer Crittenden up.
2009320	2017640	Hey, hey, what's up, everybody?
2017640	2022400	You got any opinions about how that how that shook down?
2022400	2027680	I almost passed out from boredom or?
2027680	2029520	Because all the blood was in my penis.
2035520	2036520	Do you get?
2040320	2044760	Do you get turned on by fandom issues or?
2044760	2049320	I said the passed out thing and then I thought that would be a natural linkage came out of
2049320	2050320	me.
2050320	2051320	Yeah.
2051320	2053320	Like all the semen during that conversation.
2056320	2059320	Spencer, when's your HBO special coming up?
2060320	2061320	Yeah.
2061320	2064320	We learn more about you every week.
2064320	2065320	Yeah.
2065320	2070320	So that was fascinating as a bystander to watch that because it was like it's clearly
2070320	2072320	there's there's emotions that people have about the show.
2072320	2074320	And it's it's very interesting.
2074320	2077320	I think it's like it's like being in a hall of mirrors for me.
2077320	2081320	I think there's projection upon projection upon projection upon projection.
2081320	2090320	There's like I feel so fucking much when I go into any comment section or article like
2090320	2092320	about the things that I do.
2092320	2098320	And it's the only right way to do it would be to be so detached that I can't see myself
2098320	2099320	being that kind of person.
2099320	2103320	And yet at the same time everybody who says the same thing they've been saying over and
2103320	2106320	over and over again, which is like stop it.
2106320	2108320	Stop responding.
2108320	2109320	Stop getting wound up by it.
2109320	2111320	Stop being a petty person.
2111320	2112320	Like they're all right.
2112320	2114320	They're all absolutely correct.
2114320	2116320	That is not how Vince Gilligan goes about his business.
2116320	2120320	That is not how you that is not how good people make a good show.
2120320	2126320	But it's like I don't know when to you know like when do you dye your beard.
2126320	2129320	Oh it's 40 percent gray.
2129320	2130320	It's 60 percent gray.
2130320	2131320	My temples are gray.
2131320	2134320	I got a little thinning on top.
2134320	2142320	Like when do you when do you start manipulating who you are and what how people perceive you.
2142320	2147320	Like when is that dishonesty and when is that like maintenance.
2147320	2149320	Do you think they'll ever come a point for you.
2149320	2154320	I mean do you aspire to a healthier place when things don't bother you like that.
2154320	2156320	Do you do you foresee that even being possible.
2156320	2157320	I don't.
2157320	2163320	I mean here's what a healthy guy looks like on the Internet.
2163320	2167320	He's not there.
2167320	2168320	He's healthy.
2168320	2171320	Why would he be on the Internet.
2171320	2172320	If he is on the Internet.
2172320	2176320	Well he usually looks like he has a little eyes wide shut mask on his face.
2176320	2181320	Because he's not calling himself the job that the guy that his boss can fire.
2181320	2191320	He's calling himself a scuba tube 69 and he's and he's just yelling at people about about jet propulsion or racism.
2191320	2196320	Like and like the Internet is like the sewer slash glory hole that people use.
2197320	2206320	Like 40 years old like I've really never really rarely like done the anonymous thing.
2206320	2210320	Like I've always been myself like on the Internet.
2210320	2213320	Maybe that's a weird self destructive thing that I've always done.
2213320	2222320	I should have a long time ago just like burst into a weird aerosol of weird characters that can just blog their hearts out about how much everyone's a piece of shit.
2222320	2231320	But do you think there'll ever be some sort of crossover where you become you know Buddha and you and you just and you just let things wash over you and you don't care or is that part of what drives you on the Internet.
2231320	2234320	No no I mean in general like like you know you don't like being told what to do.
2234320	2236320	You don't like people saying tie your shoe bro.
2236320	2247320	And that's you know like like you have a very strong reaction to anybody telling you to stop being you to to alter you and you know and that's that's a good thing to not like.
2247320	2254320	But do you ever see yourself just like becoming you know just becoming the dude about it like letting it all happen.
2254320	2258320	And yeah I know I'm not looking forward to it.
2258320	2265320	I got a lot of most of most of the good things that I do I do out of a nervousness that people aren't going to like me if I do something else.
2265320	2269320	I know I'm not looking forward to the guy I become when I am forced to disconnect.
2269320	2272320	You probably stop writing and probably stop you know.
2272320	2275320	I don't know I might start running really nasty shit.
2275320	2277320	I don't know. I have no idea what I do.
2277320	2280320	I don't know if it would be more or less marketable what I what I wrote.
2280320	2281320	I don't know.
2281320	2284320	I tell you I've definitely reached a tipping point.
2284320	2295320	I've definitely reached a point of like I like like clearly if I was in therapy right now I know that the therapist a long time ago listening to my description of what I've been going through.
2295320	2306320	He would have said you have to figure out who the fuck you are because what's happening to you is you are you are going to strangers to figure out who you are.
2306320	2309320	And when you do that you get what you deserve.
2309320	2318320	You are going to get static as a result and you're going to you're going to take that in as a personality that that is what a crazy person does.
2318320	2324320	A sociopath but in reverse a sociopath is you know has efficacy.
2324320	2328320	A sociopath can like taxi a plane down a runway because he doesn't care what other people think.
2328320	2330320	It's like so weird.
2330320	2331320	What am I.
2331320	2334320	Well that's a very I don't know who I am unless people are reacting to me.
2334320	2340320	I think I now know I'm a bad person because Lisa was like you know like bummed out up here.
2340320	2350320	If your identity is defined by a lot of not not a lot of you are because you're a very singular person but like a lot of your identity when you're working on community that's that's who you are.
2350320	2352320	It's it's a relationship that you have.
2352320	2354320	The characters are kind of you.
2354320	2355320	The show is you.
2355320	2356320	People like or don't like the show.
2356320	2358320	That means they like or don't like you.
2358320	2362320	That's that's that's thin ice like psychologically.
2362320	2370320	Yeah you don't go into a job like writing TV with unresolved psychological issues.
2370320	2372320	That's a bad gymnasium to work out.
2372320	2373320	Yeah.
2373320	2376320	You're not going to tone your muscles there.
2376320	2381320	You're going to like exacerbate and Charlie horse like pre-existing conditions.
2381320	2391320	Let's say you wrote a show that was a giant huge popular success or the whole like you know you have the big bang theory you have Breaking Bad you got to show that the universe loves you're on all the talk shows and everybody's adoring you.
2391320	2394320	Do you think that would be more comfortable.
2394320	2397320	No I think I would figure out a way to self destruct.
2397320	2399320	I do because I would feel like a fraud.
2399320	2403320	I would feel I think that's oppositional defiant disorder or something.
2403320	2406320	I would feel I would go like well I must be doing something wrong.
2406320	2407320	Nobody's pissed off.
2407320	2408320	Nobody's.
2408320	2409320	This is not working.
2409320	2411320	I would I would figure out a way to fuck it up.
2411320	2420320	So is it is it you not liking being told what to do or is it you like you know you're Andy Dick you want to get punched at the bar you're going to keep grabbing ass until somebody throws a punch at you.
2420320	2421320	I don't know.
2421320	2422320	I love you Andy if you're listening.
2422320	2426320	Although you stole my fucking beer yesterday you cut.
2426320	2439320	I feel like animals like you put them in a big pen and like there's a like maybe there's one of the animals that like has some kind of because it was a puppy mill puppy or something like I got to keep digging at the in some dark corner.
2439320	2443320	I would imagine you're never going to really change that or I think it's always going to be a thing.
2443320	2444320	It's a thing.
2444320	2445320	Yeah.
2445320	2446320	Yeah.
2446320	2447320	I have like a it's a tick.
2447320	2450320	Like I look at my brother is like frustratingly the same way.
2450320	2465320	Well there's a thing about you like you can be like part of what drives you like clearly like when you write anything like Dan and I took an acting class years ago and we was monologues and so we'd be at a bar an hour before the class with no monologues.
2465320	2466320	Okay.
2466320	2467320	I'm going to go home.
2467320	2468320	I'm going to write you a monologue about you being in the CIA.
2468320	2475320	I'm going to write me a monologue about being King minus and I'll see you at the class and we'd have five minutes to look it over and kind of memorize it and do it.
2475320	2476320	And they were great.
2476320	2477320	Really really good.
2477320	2486320	So there's something going on in your brain that makes you very very good at typing thoughts down and making like and making good writing out of out of ideas that you have.
2486320	2488320	It also there has to be a deficit.
2488320	2492320	There has to be something on the other side of that scale that that makes you a crazy person in certain ways.
2492320	2495320	You can't you can't be good at that and good at everything else.
2495320	2505320	And the same way like being a friend with you like there's times when you just spent so much friendship and so much wisdom like you can come to you with a problem and you just like I could just tell you a dream I had and you would you go.
2505320	2516320	Well look this is what you're going through and you can your Yoda you live in goop and you dispense Yoda wisdom and there's other times when you're just not there like like it's not like a faucet that's always on.
2516320	2528320	You can be completely distant and unapproachable you know as a friend but you get both of those things like like you get incredible outpouring of attention and then you get zero.
2528320	2533320	You know I mean that's that's that's that's that's part of he's looking at his phone.
2533320	2539320	You see what it's like I'm sorry Mitch Hurwitz has texted me sure yes.
2539320	2543320	I'll get back to you later. What did you hear what I was saying.
2543320	2548320	Something about a bad person I don't know.
2548320	2553320	Perfect. Our next guest.
2553320	2563320	I do feel like what we should do like at least for a couple of rounds just because I feel like there was there was an intensity to that exchange and those those ladies like they they represent the.
2563320	2568320	I mean what you say they represent the fandom and then they don't want to be accused of that or whatever.
2568320	2573320	I feel like she represented herself. I think she's in a weird position that I want to. Yeah.
2573320	2575320	She's not. I don't think she wants to represent everybody.
2575320	2581320	I think in some weird way she kind of now has to because you came up as the voice of a certain thought.
2581320	2585320	But you really she's just she's just being Lisa having her own visceral reactions to.
2585320	2588320	Yeah absolutely. I got punished for it for sure.
2588320	2594320	And I will always do that. I will always punish people for telling me not to talk.
2594320	2600320	But speaking of which who wants to tell me not to talk.
2600320	2605320	Let's do it. We don't do this a lot. Do like a little Q&A. Let's grab a couple because there's a lot of communicon people here.
2605320	2611320	Is there any questions or communicon that didn't get fielded. Yes. Yes.
2611320	2615320	Back in the back of the room. Yeah.
2615320	2618320	This is what I really should have. Is there going to be more inspector space time.
2618320	2623320	Is there going to be more inspector space time. There's.
2623320	2629320	Well no I'm sorry. There's no there's no inspector space time in season five as of right now.
2629320	2634320	There's not enough space or time. It's true. There's no space or time. Yeah.
2634320	2640320	And I kind of felt like I've talked about this before like inspector space time was like it.
2640320	2649320	It had this like really lofty goal. I wanted to actually be what it did start to become which is like a the show dialoguing with the fans.
2649320	2655320	But what happened was that it was so successful at doing that that Sony legal kind of panicked.
2655320	2659320	Not to vilify them like they didn't really realize what they were getting into.
2659320	2669320	And there was some poor guy whose job it was at Sony legal that had to watch all the Dr. Who's and start to get some guy whose job it is to.
2669320	2673320	There's somebody in this audience who goes I'll take that job. I know.
2673320	2679320	And some poor guy at Sony who didn't want that job is like I get paid to watch all the Dr. Who's again.
2679320	2691320	That's just so funny about it to me is that this poor guy and us in a tie I picture him in a tie with a little adding machine in his desk is like writing these emails going like well this is obviously a reference to K9.
2691320	2696320	You can't kid a kid or it's you know it's a robot cat and a robot dog. We get it.
2696320	2703320	Like he had to like take in all of the all of the minutia. Anyways any another question.
2703320	2707320	I saw. Let's go with that hand there.
2707320	2713320	I don't know if it's a question or not but it's. Who the fuck do you think you are.
2713320	2717320	That's good. I'm glad you asked.
2717320	2721320	Dad.
2721320	2724320	I just think that.
2724320	2736320	I just think that most of us recognize that the show wouldn't be what it is if you don't do what you do all the time.
2736320	2742320	You know it's like you put yourself into that show and that's why it's so great. Is there a question in there.
2742320	2747320	Don't bully him. He's praising me.
2748320	2754320	I just hate when people you know don't give questions.
2754320	2760320	And I think I think you know what most feels bad feel bad like you know what you said about season four.
2760320	2767320	Whatever however you I mean you how you feel about season four and we can't even imagine but.
2767320	2772320	The writers that's you know stuck with it and did it and kept the show on the air.
2772320	2775320	Is there a question in there.
2775320	2779320	You are now doing it again.
2779320	2784320	Yeah. Yeah. Is there a reason why Dan's gone back.
2788320	2793320	Nice.
2793320	2796320	And in case I didn't get picked up over the microphone.
2796320	2801320	Do I do I do I feel any gratitude to the people that worked on season four.
2801320	2805320	The answer that is no I might as well just like.
2805320	2808320	Walk into a barrel of tar.
2808320	2813320	Of course I feel any anybody that worked on a show that had that title.
2813320	2818320	You know especially like I did say like like you know the guys that that did take over running it.
2818320	2827320	They clearly like looked at what they were up against and actually made the weirder decision which was to try to do the weirder show.
2827320	2831320	Which they did not have to do and may have been like.
2831320	2834320	So you know I have. Yeah I did.
2834320	2842320	Looking at that I was like wow they didn't have to do that and of course anybody that was working on that show was not doing it to say fuck you to me.
2842320	2852320	I. It's hard to separate that from the kind of brain that just gets up here and says well my garage needs to be cleaned out so everyone can go fuck themselves and die.
2852320	2859320	You know it's like it's like I'm not a diplomat a politician and I am so sorry when I say like well I watch season four.
2859320	2865320	Well what was that like. Well it was like this for me boom boom.
2865320	2873320	That's what it was like for me and I was talking about myself and talking about stuff and then the next day it's like oh shit.
2873320	2878320	I forgot to add or it wasn't as delightful for me to add.
2878320	2887320	Of course hats off to anybody and then you think about the fact that I watch season four once and probably I mean look here's the other thing.
2887320	2892320	If I watch season two it would be like boom boom.
2892320	2901320	I want you probably heard my commentary on the DVDs. I'm not I'm not a big fan of my own work when I watch it again.
2901320	2916320	So I was definitely not going to be a big fan. I think the most noble thing I did was not not watch that season until I had to because I had to go back because I knew I think that was probably the only healthy part of my brain was like you're going to fuck it up for everybody.
2916320	2922320	If you watch that thing and I watched it and then I came up here like whatever.
2922320	2933320	I said how I feel and it's it's it's it sucks when I say how I feel and it hurts other people. It sucks.
2933320	2942320	Yes everyone that worked on that on that season is a hero. Everyone that works on any half hour of television.
2942320	2955320	I don't care if it's like Tim Allen go ask grandpa or like like like like is he grandpa or is he playing like she's not how dare you.
2955320	2970320	It's a show of young vivacious hipster tip Tim Allen whose grandpa moves in with him after years of being a part and he goes and asks him for advice because he knows it'll make him feel better.
2970320	2980320	Have you seen it. No it's wonderful. It's got a lot of stop motion in it. That's crazy. All the sequences in the grandfather's dinner done in stop motion.
2980320	2986320	His father is like this Cthulhu like creature who sits in the window and says go ask grandpa.
2986320	2994320	Tim Allen goes in and grandpa always sure enough his advice always works out like half right half wrong.
2994320	2999320	Is the a story always something that Tim Allen like hip Tim Allen has to like you know like he's on a date or something like that.
2999320	3004320	Yeah he's like my wallet chain got caught on the door now.
3004320	3008320	But then there's the other story is like grandpa said I need to get into the restaurant.
3008320	3012320	Now my wallet chain is caught and that's the end of the second act is like shit.
3012320	3017320	Third act took off his pants. It's really fine.
3017320	3021320	I forgot what I was talking about.
3021320	3030320	The people that work on network television shows or anybody that would ever imply that their time was less valuable to them would be a villain.
3030320	3035320	It's hard work. They go home very tired. A lot of times they don't make it all the way home.
3035320	3045320	They pull over to the side of the road and go to sleep. Sometimes they I was one of these people pull into their garage and could only make it that far and then fall asleep in their garage with their cars running.
3045320	3051320	And every once in a while statistically you know something happens because we push the limits of human labor on those television.
3051320	3057320	Is that why you got a hybrid. So I could sleep twice as long.
3057320	3060320	It's true. I'd probably be dead right now if I didn't have a hybrid.
3060320	3064320	Like I remember one night waking up in my garage with the car running. I was like oh shit it's a hybrid.
3064320	3074320	You should have just installed some ventilation in there. The crazy thing would be people would have to figure out wasn't a suicide.
3075320	3078320	Well did he have any. They would just like join.
3080320	3085320	Who would try to figure that out. If you want to murder me like do that.
3086320	3088320	There's a combo episode going on.
3090320	3097320	Yes of course. God damn it. And also in a larger sense I can't apologize enough for anything I said that hurt the people that worked on that ship.
3097320	3108320	Sorry. Sorry I crapped off at Megan Gans on Twitter. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I feel like it's some kind of personal issue for me that they made a season of my TV show without me. I'm sorry.
3108320	3114320	I think it's my TV show. That's already a petty perspective. You know it's a it's a I'm not.
3115320	3126320	That's how that's how the fans feel. It's how I feel. It's a fan's perspective. A larger person like a Paul Newman would be like it's not my salad dressing.
3126320	3135320	I don't care if you found a rat tail in it. I was in Butch and Sundance. I don't give a fuck really. He's too busy. He's too busy hating on women.
3137320	3143320	Let's do one more and then let's move on. Let's go up in front here. Oh it's Julieta. Super fan Julieta.
3144320	3147320	I have a question. You're having an animated episode?
3148320	3149320	You're having an animated episode?
3150320	3151320	Do you mean psychologically?
3156320	3169320	Yeah. That too. I mean for season five in community. And I'm an animator. And so why? Why would you not help me out man?
3172320	3174320	Yeah Dan stop being a dick.
3175320	3182320	This is a whole other episode where you come up here and we talk about this. James at Starburn's got you a work visa right?
3182320	3185320	And it got to me way too late so they had to get my job done.
3186320	3190320	Well boo hoo. Wait so he did try to help you out.
3191320	3193320	James, James Spano from Starburn's.
3194320	3203320	Under orders from Colonel Sanders? You think he would just come up with that idea on his own? He's a great guy but my God.
3204320	3207320	So where is it standing right now? You didn't get a visa so you can't work on a show?
3207320	3214320	I got it but it took too long to arrive so they had to give my job to someone else because you know I understand that TV show has to get made without me.
3218320	3220320	Seems like you're dealing with it pretty well.
3223320	3227320	I skipped work to come here because I don't like my job.
3229320	3234320	Where do you work? Give her a mic if she didn't keep talking. Let's mic her. Alright come up Julieta.
3238320	3247320	What up? Yeah I'm an animation teacher at a university. Which reminds me of Greendale.
3248320	3251320	You hate teaching these people.
3252320	3258320	I don't hate teaching them.
3258320	3261320	Enjoy this time in your career when you can say this and there's no repercussions.
3261320	3264320	Exactly. Yeah I mean no one's gonna listen to this.
3265320	3271320	I mean from my hometown, from my students are not gonna listen to this.
3271320	3277320	Well I can make sure they do. Watch this. Season four of Community was like Monterey, Mexico.
3280320	3283320	Population 16,000.
3283320	3287320	Four million. Four million? Yeah. Jesus.
3287320	3291320	But I am actually really grateful that you remember my little rant.
3292320	3296320	Of course I do. You know the real reason I do is because I play this game Pocket Planes on my iPhone.
3296320	3301320	And Monterey is like my big strategic like layover city.
3301320	3305320	Oh I'm so glad that we are useful for something other than drug dealing.
3308320	3312320	I'm gonna sing karaoke after this and I'm gonna sing it happened in Monterey in your honor tonight.
3312320	3315320	Oh my god. I am really flattered about that.
3315320	3317320	And you think we don't do shit for you.
3317320	3319320	Come again? Look at what we do for you.
3319320	3322320	What do you always think about you Julieta?
3322320	3325320	Well it's likewise.
3325320	3329320	You know I honestly and this is serious.
3329320	3333320	I cannot listen to Harmontown because I get depressed because I'm not here.
3333320	3335320	I cannot. It's true.
3335320	3338320	But you'll always be here in the form of these keychains you made.
3340320	3343320	That's me hanging from my hands.
3344320	3345320	All right.
3345320	3349320	Well yeah I love you Dan and I respect you.
3350320	3352320	Thank you Julieta.
3352320	3354320	Thank you sweetheart.
3355320	3356320	Wow Dan.
3357320	3358320	You finally get what you want.
3358320	3360320	Is someone to come up here and praise you?
3361320	3363320	I did it as a joke.
3363320	3365320	I don't think you did. I think it's...
3366320	3371320	News flash. I'm not likable.
3371320	3373320	That's why I write.
3376320	3378320	If you were likable what would you do?
3378320	3381320	Dude I would just...
3381320	3383320	You know I would be a majorette.
3384320	3386320	I would lead parades.
3388320	3390320	You have a little baton? Like a little tutu?
3390320	3391320	Yeah I would twirl.
3391320	3394320	I swear to god I would just be out in front of every parade.
3394320	3396320	No matter what's it. What's it? Thanksgiving?
3396320	3399320	Eh, Thanksgiving. It's Thanksgiving.
3399320	3402320	Look at me. Time for Thanksgiving.
3403320	3406320	The reason I do what I do is because if I did that everyone would go
3406320	3408320	what's to be thankful for really?
3409320	3411320	Maybe we should just watch Wizard of Oz.
3411320	3415320	And you know Macy's Day Parade would shut down.
3416320	3421320	But if I could just be popular I would teach girls how to play billiards.
3422320	3425320	Everybody wrapping my arms around them.
3425320	3427320	No you're doing it wrong.
3429320	3431320	In a likable way.
3431320	3434320	I would manage a bank for six months and just be like
3434320	3436320	who needs some money?
3436320	3438320	But you can't have any. I'm sorry.
3438320	3441320	If I did that I feel like people like if I said you can't have a loan
3441320	3444320	people would be like you fucking gross fat turd.
3444320	3446320	And I'd go like shit she's right.
3446320	3449320	And kill myself. So I stay away from that.
3450320	3452320	There's so much you can do if you're popular.
3452320	3454320	If you can walk away from anything going like
3454320	3457320	eh she's wrong. I'm unconditionally lovable.
3457320	3460320	I would do anything. I would probably be a serial killer.
3461320	3465320	Because that's like the top job that people come down on.
3467320	3473320	If you are really popular you could really
3473320	3476320	yeah you're right it doesn't pull down anything here.
3476320	3479320	I don't know. I mean it's like like like if you were popular.
3479320	3482320	That's why you are popular by the definition now.
3482320	3484320	You're a popular figure now.
3484320	3486320	What do you mean like.
3486320	3489320	I don't know if you're paying attention to what happened tonight for instance.
3490320	3493320	Part of being popular is also you now.
3493320	3495320	I can affect people.
3495320	3497320	You know like bad guys in the movies.
3497320	3500320	You know what they do. They like stay in a castle
3500320	3503320	and they use crystal balls and long fingernails to make shit happen.
3503320	3505320	That's writing.
3505320	3507320	That's what that is.
3507320	3510320	The good guys are out there ripped like slaying demons
3510320	3513320	with their actual sword and like making out with chicks.
3513320	3515320	Like they go places.
3515320	3518320	And the bad guy is like I'm angry at myself and no one likes me.
3518320	3520320	So I'm going to have efficacy.
3520320	3522320	I'm going to write cheers.
3524320	3528320	I want to touch people but if I touch them in real life they'll slap me.
3529320	3531320	That's what writing is.
3532320	3535320	It's a gross person getting a hug.
3538320	3541320	I can't believe that's surprising to anybody.
3541320	3543320	Who do you think does this?
3543320	3546320	That's so sad and so sweet at the same time.
3546320	3548320	Who do you think puts this kind of time into that?
3548320	3552320	You know like a document that says hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me.
3552320	3554320	Not a person that gets hugs all the time.
3554320	3557320	I mean now everyone's going to rush the stage and hug me.
3557320	3559320	All right. You didn't.
3560320	3562320	All right. I'm kidding.
3562320	3565320	Why don't we get into Dungeons and Dragons. Sweet.
3570320	3572320	Do you want more players or what?
3572320	3574320	Fuck no man.
3574320	3577320	All right. The gruesome twosome.
3577320	3580320	Hey man we still got character sheets and shit.
3580320	3582320	Should I hold the music?
3582320	3584320	Well at least rewind it in the future.
3584320	3586320	Well let's check in with Spencer while he's sorting our stuff out.
3586320	3588320	What's going on? What's it like being my assistant?
3588320	3590320	This is the same question every week.
3590320	3592320	It's been two weeks.
3592320	3594320	Yeah. It's cool.
3594320	3600320	I'm glad that sometimes you know we feel more comfortable talking about my weaknesses as an assistant now.
3600320	3607320	Because you know that sort of feedback is important to me and it helps me hopefully improve my job.
3607320	3609320	Where do you feel like you're dropping the ball Spencer?
3609320	3615320	I just I come from a lot of jobs where you had like everything to do 100% of the time.
3615320	3617320	You had Apple like there's always things to organize.
3617320	3623320	Before that I worked at a book company and like there was literally just carts of books and they wouldn't stop.
3623320	3626320	So it was like you know that sushi I love Lucy thing but with books.
3626320	3629320	So I mean so I'm not constantly.
3629320	3631320	You mean the chocolate one.
3631320	3632320	Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
3632320	3633320	Sushi would have been awesome.
3633320	3636320	It's like that sushi thing. It's like that sushi thing in Drake and Josh.
3636320	3643320	So I saw I saw that I love Lucy thing too to be fair.
3643320	3649320	But yeah they executed a lot better.
3649320	3652320	Well while I'm being the villain here.
3652320	3656320	Did anyone remember I feel 65.
3656320	3658320	No no not blue.
3658320	3661320	They had other songs.
3661320	3664320	Specifically that song PlayStation.
3664320	3667320	Does anyone remember the PlayStation.
3667320	3669320	I don't even know what a Jake and Josh is.
3669320	3670320	I don't know what you're talking about.
3670320	3671320	It's cool. It's cool.
3671320	3673320	It's like a space baby.
3673320	3674320	I'm just.
3674320	3676320	The PlayStation song has been stuck in my head.
3676320	3677320	The PlayStation.
3677320	3681320	It's a blue blue blue blue.
3681320	3685320	This is my nightmare.
3685320	3687320	No blue was a good song also.
3687320	3689320	I mean this is a song on a video game.
3689320	3694320	You know it was a song about PlayStation and like I feel 60s not five.
3694320	3697320	They just like they made their music and like Fruit Loops or something.
3697320	3699320	It was just like synth synth pop stuff.
3699320	3701320	Oh my God all these buzzwords.
3701320	3702320	Yeah.
3702320	3704320	I'm just seeing my words just fly over your heads.
3704320	3706320	It's amazing.
3706320	3707320	But yeah so.
3707320	3711320	Is it one of them rock and rolly bands.
3711320	3714320	But all their song lyrics were just like really really repetitive
3714320	3718320	because they went along with like the the dancey electronic kind of music.
3718320	3721320	And back then that was kind of repetitive sometimes.
3721320	3727320	So it was just they were most of the song was just lift listing off video games.
3727320	3729320	So are you saying you have that as an earworm right now.
3729320	3730320	Yeah.
3730320	3731320	You're struggling with that.
3731320	3732320	Yeah.
3732320	3733320	Yeah.
3733320	3734320	I get the worst.
3734320	3736320	I have an earworm song almost every day and they're really bad.
3736320	3737320	There's like the songs I don't.
3737320	3739320	The worst when you have a song stuck in your head that you don't even know.
3739320	3740320	Yeah.
3740320	3741320	Like you don't even know the words to it.
3741320	3742320	So it's stuck in your head.
3742320	3743320	But you can't even.
3743320	3744320	You can't even sing it.
3744320	3748320	I heard somewhere that the most important part of an earworm is like the tempo.
3748320	3752320	Like if you have a song stuck in your head you have its tempo exactly right.
3752320	3754320	So how do you how do you how do you break that.
3754320	3755320	I don't think you can.
3755320	3758320	But I think it's like songs that have complicated tempos that just doesn't happen.
3758320	3761320	Didn't Dino say that Colbert is not wrong ones.
3761320	3765320	Do you think Dino said that Stephen Colbert is cure for getting a song stuck in your head
3765320	3766320	out.
3766320	3772320	It's just sing a song and then go by men and then you're done.
3772320	3773320	Wait.
3773320	3774320	Should we have a guest play.
3774320	3775320	Christopher.
3775320	3776320	I asked that.
3776320	3777320	You said no.
3777320	3778320	No.
3778320	3779320	I thought about it now.
3779320	3780320	OK.
3780320	3781320	All right.
3781320	3781320	
3782320	3783320	Julie.
3783320	3784320	I play Mulrain Sedana.
3789320	3795320	And I'm just going to go by by by gut and have Tyler reprise Christa Berg.
3795320	3796320	All right.
3796320	3797320	Tyler to the stage.
3798320	3800320	Character sheets have been dispensed.
3800320	3803320	So some will pass mine down to me please.
3803320	3805320	And Spencer take it away sir.
3805320	3806320	All right.
3807320	3808320	Thank you.
3808320	3815320	When we last met our heroes had been climbing the spires of Admiral Darkstar's black keep
3815320	3819320	in order to put a stop to the madman's evil schemes.
3819320	3824320	After filling the room with lava the heroes took refuge on massive stone statues.
3824320	3829320	But as they plotted their next move they were interrupted by a familiar face.
3829320	3830320	Brefi.
3830320	3836320	That spider creature from the shadow plane was back re-engineered with metallic parts
3836320	3838320	and a singular focus.
3838320	3840320	Destroying Quark.
3840320	3845320	Quickly Quark climbed the chains headbutting the cyborg spider with a dagger strapped
3845320	3846320	to his face.
3847320	3849320	Brefi shot back.
3850320	3851320	I had nothing to do with that.
3852320	3853320	That's true.
3854320	3857320	It's also pronounced nar-wall not nor-wall.
3857320	3858320	I mean I said it fine.
3858320	3859320	No one's going to get that.
3859320	3860320	Yeah.
3860320	3861320	But you know.
3861320	3862320	Go on.
3862320	3863320	Nar-wall.
3864320	3865320	Jesus.
3866320	3867320	Yeah.
3867320	3868320	You're not wrong.
3868320	3871320	He shot spikes and hit him in the stomach.
3871320	3872320	Done.
3873320	3874320	All right.
3874320	3875320	All right.
3875320	3879320	So we're still in the midst of this fight with our former ally turned enemy.
3879320	3880320	Okay.
3880320	3882320	So what's our 20 right now?
3882320	3883320	Where are we all positioned?
3883320	3886320	So everyone but Quark is standing on these three statues.
3886320	3889320	Think of them as islands in a sea of lava.
3889320	3895320	So above you lies a lattice of linked chains forming a sort of dizzying tangle or web of
3895320	3896320	clanking steel.
3896320	3900320	Above in this web of steel you can see Brefi.
3900320	3903320	He's kind of situated in the middle like a big spider.
3903320	3905320	And Quark you're up there with him.
3905320	3906320	Your headbutting him in the face.
3906320	3908320	Didn't he get a chain impaled through him?
3908320	3910320	That was you.
3911320	3912320	Oh shit.
3912320	3913320	All right.
3913320	3915320	So you have a chain in your stomach.
3915320	3917320	You're currently being reeled in.
3917320	3919320	Reeled in by the stomach chain.
3919320	3920320	Scorpion style.
3920320	3924320	But last I remember I wanted this.
3924320	3926320	This was something that I was into.
3926320	3928320	I wanted to pull him, pull myself to him.
3928320	3930320	I mean that's all you man.
3930320	3933320	Can I start off by taking the dagger off of my head?
3933320	3934320	Yeah.
3934320	3935320	Good.
3935320	3936320	Thank you.
3936320	3937320	All right.
3937320	3939320	I'm an incredible pain but that's a good idea.
3939320	3944320	You hear the skittering scratching metal grate and you see steel pulp plates open up in Brefi's
3944320	3945320	armor.
3945320	3951320	You see spider like metal things scramble out of his body and go into the tangle of
3951320	3954320	chains around you.
3954320	3956320	Spiders are all over the place.
3956320	3957320	Robot spider.
3957320	3958320	Yeah.
3958320	3959320	The worst kind.
3959320	3961320	And is the lava still rising?
3961320	3962320	Oh yeah.
3962320	3963320	And how much room do we-
3963320	3964320	You're fine.
3964320	3965320	You're way ahead of everybody else.
3965320	3967320	These guys are in dire straits.
3967320	3969320	I'm on Brefi's back, right?
3969320	3970320	You were-
3970320	3971320	Yeah.
3971320	3972320	No.
3972320	3973320	No different.
3973320	3974320	I don't think so.
3974320	3975320	Okay.
3975320	3976320	He was.
3976320	3977320	He was.
3977320	3978320	Thanks Adam.
3978320	3979320	Thank you Adam Goldberg.
3979320	3980320	Yeah.
3980320	3981320	Yeah.
3981320	3982320	Give credit where credit's due.
3982320	3983320	Where am I?
3983320	3984320	You are on one of these islands in the lava.
3984320	3985320	Okay.
3985320	3986320	Monterey.
3986320	3987320	Okay.
3987320	3988320	You should get up here-
3988320	3989320	Population four million.
3989320	3990320	Yeah.
3990320	3994320	You should get up here in the chains with us and fight this robot asshole.
3994320	3998600	I want to- do I have rope?
3998600	3999600	You do.
3999600	4000600	Okay.
4000600	4001600	So I tie a rope-
4001600	4003600	Why does everybody tie everything to everything?
4003600	4004600	Sorry.
4004600	4005600	Go ahead.
4005600	4012760	So I tie my rope to my arrow and I shoot it to towards like somewhere where you can attach
4012760	4013760	so I can, you know-
4013760	4014760	Grappling hook style.
4014760	4015760	Oh I see.
4015760	4016760	Yeah.
4016760	4017760	That's it.
4017760	4018760	Okay.
4018760	4019760	Gotcha.
4019760	4020760	So I shoot two arrows.
4020760	4021760	Just one.
4021760	4023920	You shoot one arrow.
4023920	4028600	As you shoot you realize you must have not tied the rope or something correctly because-
4028600	4029600	Oh poopies.
4029600	4031600	The arrow is pulled into the lava-
4031600	4032600	Oh poopies.
4032600	4033600	You're wrestling with it.
4033600	4035600	All the rope falls into the lava.
4035600	4039000	Don't applaud that Adam.
4039000	4040000	That's a crit-
4040000	4041720	I rolled a critical fail if anyone's wondering.
4041720	4043120	So that's why that happened.
4043120	4045960	I'm not just vindictive.
4045960	4048360	Also my rope is critically heavier than an arrow.
4048360	4049360	Yeah.
4049360	4051480	It really throws off the aerodynamics.
4051480	4052840	But I mean mostly the one.
4052840	4053840	The aerodynamics.
4053840	4054840	Yeah.
4054840	4055840	No.
4055840	4056840	No.
4056840	4057840	Arrows use aerodynamics.
4057840	4058840	So do aeroplanes.
4059840	4060840	So do aeroplanes.
4064840	4066840	Putting it at Sharpie's turn.
4066840	4067840	Really?
4067840	4071840	Oh shock and grasp on Brefi upon whom I am standing.
4071840	4072840	Well hang on.
4072840	4073840	One quick question.
4073840	4074840	Yeah.
4074840	4076840	He has a metal chain coming out of him that's in me.
4076840	4080840	If you shock and grasp him is this bad times for me?
4080840	4084840	Well I mean that would have been a great question to ask 20 seconds ago.
4086840	4087840	Son of a bitch.
4088840	4089840	I think it'll be okay.
4089840	4090840	Oh.
4090840	4091840	Shock and grasp.
4091840	4092840	Okay so it hits.
4092840	4094840	If it was going to hurt anybody it would hurt me.
4094840	4095840	Yeah.
4095840	4096840	It's coming out of my hands.
4096840	4097840	Your magic.
4097840	4098840	Right.
4098840	4099840	You know what?
4099840	4100840	You are too.
4100840	4101840	Thanks buddy.
4101840	4102840	I appreciate that.
4102840	4104840	Dealing 20 damage.
4104840	4108840	Oh shit.
4108840	4113840	You feel him kind of buckle under the electric stress of the lightning but he doesn't move
4113840	4114840	further.
4114840	4115840	You like that?
4116840	4117840	No.
4117840	4118840	Am I good?
4118840	4119840	I'm good?
4119840	4120840	I mean sure.
4120840	4121840	Okay.
4121840	4122840	We're good.
4122840	4123840	You got a thing in your stomach.
4123840	4124840	I mean you're not great.
4124840	4128840	Right but I'm not thinking of my stomach and electrocuted.
4128840	4129840	Correct.
4129840	4130840	Okay.
4130840	4131840	Pudding it at cork stir.
4131840	4132840	All right.
4132840	4136840	It's clearly me that he's mad at because I fucked him and then stabbed him in the back
4136840	4140840	of the neck and killed him a long time ago.
4140840	4141840	In that order?
4141840	4142840	I think.
4142840	4144840	As I recall I got up on top of him.
4144840	4147840	He was unconscious and I said I wooed him to sleep kind of.
4147840	4150840	I was really romantic and then I started fucking him.
4150840	4153840	And then I took a sword out and drove it through the back of his skull, right?
4153840	4154840	Yeah.
4154840	4157840	Well as long as you were romantic about it.
4157840	4160840	If it's worth doing it's worth doing right.
4160840	4165840	I take out my far sword with a flaming sword and I use my far sword attack on Brefi.
4165840	4171840	Using your far sword attack on Brefi you cut a wide swath of flame.
4171840	4173840	It hits.
4173840	4179840	You strike Brefi in three of his legs.
4179840	4181840	They're burned.
4181840	4187840	He takes ten damage and your far sword wave continues on slicing through several of these
4187840	4190840	chains and causing them to fall and kind of hang.
4190840	4191840	Hang down.
4191840	4192840	Ooh.
4192840	4193840	Yeah.
4193840	4194840	That could be good.
4194840	4195840	We could use us to climb up maybe.
4195840	4196840	Yeah.
4196840	4198840	As it happens he kind of readjusts his balance to compensate for this.
4198840	4202840	He's not but he's unsteady now that he's got all these wounded legs going on.
4202840	4203840	Ooh.
4203840	4204840	Go for the legs you guys.
4204840	4207840	He can't stay up there without legs.
4207840	4208840	Most of us can't.
4208840	4210840	Just let me know when it's my turn.
4210840	4211840	I will.
4211840	4214840	Putting it at Kristoberg's turn.
4214840	4215840	Okay.
4215840	4217840	No seriously let me know when it's my turn.
4217840	4219840	I definitely will.
4219840	4220840	Don't worry.
4220840	4222840	We'll let you know.
4222840	4223840	I just said that.
4223840	4224840	Okay.
4224840	4225840	I'm helping.
4225840	4227840	So I have a chain in me.
4227840	4228840	That's not great.
4228840	4229840	Yep.
4229840	4230840	I'm attached to him.
4231840	4235840	I'm going to use my armor to autumn and go invisible and see if I can get a little bit
4235840	4240840	closer to him without him noticing that I mean he might notice I'm attached to him
4240840	4241840	but I'm going to at least try.
4241840	4244840	I'd like to get in closer to him while invisible.
4246840	4247840	Yep.
4247840	4248840	That happens.
4248840	4250840	I was just making sure you didn't run out of invisibilities for the day.
4250840	4251840	Kristoberg.
4251840	4253840	Kristoberg he's hanging up with these chains by three legs.
4253840	4256840	If he falls in and you're attached to him aren't you going into the lava with him?
4256840	4258840	Whatever it takes.
4259840	4260840	Wow.
4262840	4264840	Fucking California man.
4266840	4268840	You go invisible on the end of the chain.
4268840	4269840	Okay.
4270840	4271840	Putting it in.
4271840	4272840	Oh that's it?
4272840	4273840	Yeah that's it.
4273840	4274840	All right.
4274840	4275840	I'm invisible now.
4275840	4276840	These things happen.
4276840	4278840	Putting it at Brefi's turn.
4278840	4285840	Brefi turns his head all the way around like a robot owl person from that movie.
4286840	4287840	Clash of the Titans?
4287840	4288840	No.
4288840	4289840	Exorcism.
4289840	4290840	The Exorcist.
4290840	4291840	Okay.
4291840	4292840	Well there is a robot owl in Clash of the Titans.
4292840	4295840	There's all sorts of things in all sorts of places.
4297840	4300840	But Jeff you just got to keep your head up.
4300840	4301840	Okay man.
4302840	4303840	You're right Spencer.
4304840	4305840	Sorry I have a question.
4305840	4312840	And as his head turns around to look at Sharpie his eyes begin to glow red and beams of light emit from them.
4312840	4315840	I assume that's the red light of remorse.
4317840	4319840	And I just want to say you don't have to feel bad.
4319840	4321840	We've all made mistakes.
4321840	4324840	Siding with Admiral Darkstar was one of yours.
4324840	4326840	Murdering you for no reason was ours.
4329840	4333840	I don't want to throw my friend under the bus but we've always wondered about him.
4334840	4335840	You felt the pain.
4335840	4336840	You felt the burn.
4336840	4339840	Now let's all live and learn.
4341840	4345840	Usually I let like the speech happen but light is faster.
4345840	4347840	I mean it's the speed of light.
4347840	4349840	So about like three words into that.
4351840	4355840	Your speech turns into something more resembling like ahh or something.
4357840	4360840	You take eight damage of searing blazing heat.
4363840	4365840	All right you're going to keep track of that right?
4365840	4369840	Yeah I think you and Christoper are pretty much the only people hurt right now.
4369840	4370840	Anyway.
4372840	4373840	She's all right.
4373840	4379840	At the same time the spiders start to scuttle down the chains and start to get closer to all of you.
4380840	4382840	They start to ju- they don't start.
4382840	4385840	They just finish jumping upon you.
4388840	4390840	It wasn't a joke I mean.
4391840	4392840	No it's not.
4392840	4394840	I mean that's what I just said.
4394840	4395840	Anyway.
4395840	4400840	Court manages to dodge however the rest of you get hit by robotic spiders.
4400840	4402840	You feel a kind of sharp sting as they strain.
4402840	4404840	You feel their legs poking into your back.
4404840	4405840	They stick.
4405840	4407840	Stick onto your bodies.
4408840	4410840	Ahh get it off get it off get it off.
4410840	4411840	I'm immersed.
4411840	4413840	Everybody get Mulrain's turn.
4413840	4414840	This is an acupuncture.
4414840	4415840	Don't panic everybody.
4415840	4417840	I'll go just I'll fuck them and kill them all.
4420840	4422840	Can your dick stand all these metal spiders?
4422840	4423840	We're going to find out.
4423840	4424840	Okay.
4427840	4428840	Thank you.
4428840	4429840	Well done.
4429840	4431840	Putting it at Mulrain's turn.
4431840	4432840	What?
4432840	4434840	Putting it at Mulrain's turn.
4434840	4435840	No no.
4435840	4436840	What are you going to do Mulrain?
4436840	4437840	It's your turn.
4437840	4438840	Yeah yeah I'm thinking.
4438840	4439840	Oh cool.
4439840	4443840	Yeah I'm terrified by that metallic spider in my back.
4443840	4444840	Yeah.
4445840	4447840	So uh fuck.
4449840	4456840	I I I don't know like how much space I have in my eye line in the house.
4457840	4459840	You're on a space about three feet square.
4459840	4462840	There's about three feet above your head or some of these chains.
4462840	4464840	I think in metric.
4465840	4466840	Three feet.
4466840	4467840	Three feet's a meter.
4467840	4468840	I think that's a pretty fair thing to know.
4468840	4469840	Oh.
4469840	4470840	Two liters of chains.
4472840	4473840	Okay that's not too bad.
4473840	4476840	Um okay so I have like I'm going to do this.
4476840	4477840	Okay.
4477840	4478840	Yeah.
4478840	4483840	I'm thinking um um um um okay um how much pain am I?
4483840	4489840	Uh I mean not much it's it's more the weirdness of a metal spider being on you that's the problem you know.
4489840	4492840	Okay could I just like shove it off?
4492840	4495840	You can try but it's on your back it would be hard to shove.
4496840	4498840	What if I'm very flexible?
4499840	4500840	We'll see.
4502840	4507840	You try and grab at it and you get at it with both hands but you can't prize it off your back.
4507840	4509840	Oh well there's a turn.
4509840	4512840	No you got you got you got a move action if you'd like one.
4512840	4513840	Oh.
4513840	4515840	Get up on these chains.
4515840	4516840	Well yeah.
4516840	4517840	What?
4517840	4521840	Uh well uh yeah well since I can't do that I'll just try to climb.
4521840	4522840	Makes sense to me.
4522840	4524840	$4.95 for the race-eroding.
4525840	4526840	What?
4526840	4529840	You leap upon a chain and start to pull yourself into the web.
4529840	4531840	Putting in it.
4531840	4532840	Now Dan it's your turn.
4532840	4534840	Sharpie's turn.
4534840	4536840	As I was saying.
4537840	4540840	You are clearly stricken low Brefi.
4540840	4545840	You have chosen your foes and alliances unwisely.
4545840	4550840	I understand why you chose them but now you need to look at how practical those choices are.
4550840	4552840	For we will kill you soon.
4552840	4557840	And you will only be left with death and integrity.
4557840	4562840	Join us now and have shame and life.
4563840	4570840	Do we really want a robotic spider that Korg has fucked following us or fucked and killed following us?
4570840	4573840	He'll be like our Slimer. He'll like help us.
4573840	4576840	Are you implying that the Ghostbusters fucked Slimer?
4576840	4579840	Look I don't know what happened that night.
4583840	4585840	I wasn't involved with that.
4585840	4587840	I just know that we angered the spider.
4587840	4589840	It was a lot of misunderstanding.
4589840	4592840	Like we go through this universe Brefi. I'm talking to him.
4592840	4596840	And we have random encounters with monsters.
4599840	4601840	We didn't Craigslist this.
4601840	4606840	And some of those encounters have non-conflict resolutions and some of them don't appear to.
4606840	4611840	And you know things go off half cocked and I don't know people get hurt.
4612840	4619840	And I'm saying to you brother with my 11 charisma.
4625840	4632840	And my 12 indecipher script.
4633840	4635840	I'm saying.
4637840	4643840	I can read the script of your face and I decipher your feelings.
4644840	4648840	I forgive you. Do you forgive me?
4649840	4651840	No.
4654840	4660840	While this is nice that you're doing this long conversation because I've been using this time to climb around
4660840	4664840	to get into prime fucking and killing position behind Brefi.
4664840	4665840	In that order?
4665840	4666840	Oh yeah.
4669840	4670840	Alright.
4670840	4672840	How close am I? Is it my turn?
4672840	4674840	I don't know. Are you done?
4674840	4676840	Can I do something else?
4676840	4677840	Yeah.
4677840	4679840	Shock and grasp.
4682840	4688840	Despite being on his back something about something maybe it was just the long speech.
4688840	4694840	You gave him the time to avoid your attack. You managed to miss touching him while being on his back.
4695840	4696840	Alright.
4697840	4698840	I guess I accept that.
4698840	4700840	Maybe you ran out of breath.
4702840	4706840	How close am I to the chains that Brefi is hanging from?
4706840	4709840	You're about five feet away pretty close.
4709840	4712840	Okay. Can I use a cleave and try to get both of the chains?
4712840	4713840	Yeah.
4713840	4715840	Okay. I take my mighty sword and do a cleave to knock the...
4715840	4717840	Are you guys still attached to him?
4717840	4718840	I am.
4718840	4720840	This is a bad idea. Everybody get off!
4720840	4721840	Ow!
4721840	4722840	I don't... Shit.
4722840	4725840	I pour a vial acid on my chain. I have one of those.
4725840	4731840	Um, shit. Can I... I can't release him into the lava with you guys attached to him.
4731840	4732840	I mean.
4732840	4736840	I have a wire saw. I can go... I'm trying! Really hard.
4736840	4739840	That would just release you into the lava earlier.
4740840	4743840	Am I solely being suspended by the chain that he impaled me on?
4743840	4746840	Yeah. You're not like... Yeah.
4746840	4747840	Fuck.
4747840	4749840	You're like an ornament.
4749840	4751840	I mean, do it, man. If he falls in the lava...
4751840	4753840	Yeah, I can't do that. I can't do that.
4753840	4756840	As I'm about to do that, I realize that would be a terrible thing to do.
4756840	4761840	So, um, I go for cleave and try to get his remaining legs.
4761840	4767840	You try to go for the cleave on the remaining legs.
4767840	4771840	You strike but one of them dealing...
4771840	4773840	Jesus Christ.
4774840	4776840	17 damage.
4780840	4784840	His leg is shorn completely off and falls into the orange lava.
4784840	4785840	So how many legs does he have now?
4785840	4787840	Uh, I'm attached to him.
4787840	4789840	Yeah.
4790840	4793840	Can I... Can I try to make a grab for a chain last minute?
4793840	4795840	Just his leg falls into the lava.
4795840	4796840	Okay, just the leg. He's right?
4796840	4797840	Just the leg.
4797840	4798840	Okay. Alright.
4798840	4801840	And he has three damaged legs that are still attached to his body.
4802840	4806840	I mean, no, only one leg is gone, three are damaged.
4806840	4807840	Okay.
4807840	4809840	The rest are healthy legs.
4809840	4814840	He... I can assume he has the proper arachnid eight legs.
4814840	4815840	Yeah.
4815840	4816840	Okay.
4816840	4817840	Just counting in my head.
4817840	4819840	Yeah, alright.
4819840	4822840	Four cool, three not so cool ones gone.
4822840	4824840	Putting it at Krista Berg's turn.
4824840	4825840	Alright.
4825840	4829840	I didn't realize I was suspended solely on a chain like an ornament.
4829840	4830840	Yeah.
4830840	4833840	Um, this... I want to get... Let me...
4833840	4834840	Can I get to it?
4834840	4838840	As a move action, can I try to get on the chain so I'm not solely suspended by him?
4838840	4841840	You'd have to pull yourself up by this chain.
4841840	4844840	Okay. Let's try it. Let's do it.
4844840	4846840	Trying to do that.
4846840	4849840	You tug at the chains, but is it in vain?
4849840	4852840	You can't. You can't do it.
4852840	4854840	What's beneath me?
4854840	4856840	Lava. Lava.
4856840	4858840	Try to swing yourself.
4858840	4863840	I mean, I can try swing... I mean, I kind of want to get this chain off of me, though.
4863840	4865840	I have a saw. I have...
4865840	4868840	I think first thing, Chris, is get yourself onto a chain that you can actually...
4868840	4869840	Yeah.
4869840	4870840	Like you want to be on.
4870840	4871840	Okay.
4871840	4872840	Pitfall, carry it over to one of those things.
4872840	4876840	Yeah. Let me see if I can get some momentum on myself to get myself closer to one of those chains.
4876840	4878840	Alright. You managed to swing yourself up.
4878840	4883840	You're starting to get some momentum, but it's going to take another turn to actually get you that high.
4883840	4884840	Sounds good.
4884840	4887840	You're getting... You're getting going, though. It's pretty good.
4887840	4890840	I'm really excited about how fast I'm swinging.
4890840	4892840	It's like a metronome or something.
4892840	4893840	Great.
4893840	4894840	Yeah.
4894840	4895840	Is that another metric system thing?
4895840	4896840	No.
4896840	4897840	A metric? No. No.
4897840	4899840	This is bad. I'm sorry.
4899840	4901840	Anyway...
4901840	4904840	It was worth a try. It was worth a try.
4904840	4906840	Putting it at Brefi's turn.
4906840	4908840	It was no aerodynamics.
4910840	4911840	I mean...
4911840	4912840	You mean it was no pun intended?
4912840	4913840	But what is?
4914840	4915840	Anyway...
4915840	4918840	You feel these metal spiders all up in your back.
4918840	4921840	They're digging in deeper, and they're pulling in tighter, and it's hurting.
4921840	4922840	It's hurting.
4922840	4925840	And now they're starting to heat up.
4925840	4927840	They're feeling warm. They're feeling hot.
4930840	4931840	Who are you talking to?
4931840	4933840	It's like a shiatsu thing?
4933840	4936840	A shiatsu, like a hot stone?
4936840	4938840	No. Like you're sitting in a...
4938840	4939840	Nope.
4940840	4943840	It's more like a metal spider that is dug upon your back.
4943840	4946840	Not a sharper image temperature.
4946840	4950840	Anyway, as that happens, you see Brefi.
4950840	4952840	His eyes, now they're glowing again.
4952840	4954840	They're not glowing red, though, like the lasers.
4954840	4958840	They're glowing green, and you see crackling energy develop on his skin.
4958840	4963840	And it actually goes out, and it arcs, enlightening arcs directly at you.
4963840	4966840	And you feel all these lightnings going through your bodies.
4967840	4971840	And they hit the spider on your backs, and you feel it just light up.
4971840	4972840	No.
4972840	4976840	White hot on your back, and it burns, and it burns, and your skin is melting.
4976840	4981840	And the charred metal spiders fall off as electrical energy surges through your bodies.
4982840	4983840	Dealing.
4985840	4987840	Quark, you take seven.
4987840	4988840	Christoperg takes 11.
4988840	4989840	Yeah.
4989840	4990840	I didn't have a spider on me.
4990840	4992840	You didn't? That's true.
4992840	4994840	Quark takes zero.
4995840	4996840	Yeah.
4997840	4999840	Christoperg takes 11.
4999840	5002840	Mulrein also takes 11, Dash.
5002840	5004840	Sharpie takes 12.
5004840	5006840	I didn't have a spider on me.
5006840	5007840	You did.
5009840	5011840	It's not going to work.
5011840	5013840	It's not just that I'm not paying attention.
5013840	5015840	Try to Jedi mind trick Spencer.
5015840	5018840	I mean, from my perspective, that's how it works.
5018840	5020840	Well, he was right.
5020840	5022840	I mean, I totally forgot that it missed him.
5022840	5023840	Sorry.
5023840	5024840	Sorry, Jeff.
5024840	5026840	I have my arm out of winter.
5026840	5028840	The spiders are all gone, though, now.
5028840	5029840	Oh, yeah.
5029840	5032840	So that was kind of a good thing and a bad thing at once.
5032840	5034840	The spiders are off of you, but now you got hurt.
5034840	5038840	Yeah, it's kind of like when a guy stabs you, he no longer has a knife.
5039840	5041840	There's silver lining there.
5041840	5043840	Now I'm dying more.
5043840	5046840	But there's one less bullet in his gun.
5046840	5049840	Let's knock this guy off his chains.
5049840	5051840	Putting it at Mulrein's turn.
5051840	5052840	Okay.
5052840	5055840	Can I suit up?
5055840	5057840	Wait, what?
5057840	5059840	Did you say suit up?
5059840	5060840	Okay.
5060840	5062840	No, I thought you said can I suit up?
5062840	5063840	Yeah, yeah.
5063840	5065840	Like I have a cloak of resistance.
5065840	5068840	So I'm just being preventive for the next tiny little spiders.
5068840	5070840	Well, you're already wearing that.
5070840	5071840	That's on your body.
5071840	5072840	Oh, okay.
5072840	5073840	Well, I didn't know that.
5073840	5074840	It's okay.
5074840	5075840	I'm just telling you.
5075840	5076840	I know.
5076840	5078840	I am being grateful for the information.
5078840	5085840	So in that case, I'm going to shoot two arrows to one of the injured legs.
5085840	5086840	I have three now.
5086840	5087840	Oh, I'm sorry.
5087840	5088840	Yeah, yeah.
5088840	5089840	It's true, huh?
5089840	5092840	Like I said, I can't listen to the podcast without feeling depressed.
5092840	5095840	So I showed three arrows.
5095840	5096840	Huzzah!
5096840	5099840	You fired three arrows.
5099840	5102840	Two of them strike true.
5102840	5106840	Woo!
5106840	5108840	Being an useful woman.
5108840	5111840	I mean, a useful female character.
5111840	5112840	That's what I meant.
5112840	5115840	Dealing 16 damage.
5115840	5122840	That was very dynamic with those arrows.
5122840	5126840	What you did there was very aerodynamic.
5126840	5128840	Yeah, I applaud that pun.
5128840	5130840	Boo!
5130840	5133840	I thought that was funny, and then I got it.
5133840	5134840	Yeah, right?
5134840	5135840	That's not how it works.
5135840	5136840	That's not how it works.
5136840	5137840	You thought it was funny first.
5137840	5141840	Yeah, if you have to think about it, then it's still funny.
5141840	5142840	That's how the saying goes, right?
5142840	5144840	Yeah.
5144840	5149840	Like if someone tickles you, if you think about it, there's no reason to laugh at that.
5149840	5150840	Christa Bergstrom?
5150840	5151840	Quark's turn.
5151840	5152840	Oh, my turn.
5152840	5153840	No, no, I'm sorry.
5153840	5154840	Sharpie, sir.
5154840	5155840	Sorry.
5155840	5156840	Sharpie.
5156840	5157840	There's both the AR sounds in both your names.
5157840	5158840	It's fucked.
5159840	5161840	Character design 101.
5161840	5162840	Sharpie, knock him off those chains.
5162840	5164840	All right.
5164840	5165840	I'm on top of him.
5165840	5168840	Oh.
5168840	5169840	I'm still swinging.
5169840	5172840	I'm going to assume that I'm out of shocking grasp.
5172840	5173840	Yeah.
5173840	5174840	That's like three.
5174840	5175840	Yeah.
5175840	5178840	And I'm going to assume that reduced person doesn't work on a spider person.
5178840	5179840	Correct.
5179840	5180840	Even though I knew him as a person.
5180840	5181840	That's true.
5181840	5185840	Is reduced person a physically reducing size of a person?
5185840	5186840	Yeah.
5186840	5187840	Yeah.
5188840	5190840	It's not that important.
5191840	5192840	Okay.
5192840	5194840	So just do Uncle Dan a favor.
5194840	5196840	Just indulge me for a second.
5196840	5199840	I was raised in an era of video games.
5199840	5202840	I can't picture what the hell is going on right now.
5202840	5204840	We are in a room that's filling with lava.
5204840	5208840	There's chains hanging down in a sort of web-ishness.
5208840	5209840	Yeah.
5209840	5212840	Breffy is now in that web-ishness.
5212840	5213840	Yeah.
5213840	5215840	And I'm on his back.
5215840	5218840	What's his knuckle is like hanging from.
5218840	5219840	Yeah.
5219840	5220840	Like a.
5220840	5222840	That's been shot out from Breffy.
5222840	5223840	Yeah.
5223840	5225840	He shot a chain out of his chest cavity.
5225840	5228840	And he's hanging from another chain or he's just.
5228840	5229840	He's swinging right now.
5229840	5232840	Like this hurts so much, but I need to get another chain.
5232840	5233840	It really does.
5233840	5235840	Hanging from Breffy.
5235840	5236840	Yeah.
5236840	5238840	And I'm like I'm an ornament.
5238840	5239840	All right.
5239840	5240840	An accessory.
5240840	5241840	I'm an invisible.
5241840	5242840	I'm an invisible.
5242840	5243840	Yeah.
5243840	5244840	All we're seeing is.
5244840	5245840	The chain is swinging.
5245840	5246840	The chain is swinging.
5246840	5247840	I'm here you guys.
5247840	5249840	It's not just the chain.
5249840	5251840	I swear.
5251840	5252840	I know there's something really.
5252840	5259840	You're like the invisible straps on the invisible straps bra.
5259840	5262840	I am kind of like a bra aren't I?
5262840	5263840	Okay.
5263840	5264840	You're very supportive.
5264840	5265840	Thank you.
5265840	5266840	Wow.
5266840	5267840	Okay.
5267840	5268840	I'm sorry I started the pun thing.
5268840	5269840	Let's leave it.
5269840	5270840	Yeah.
5270840	5272840	I have to deal with this now.
5272840	5273840	Son of a bitch.
5273840	5278640	I can't shrink item on the chain in his chest and make it small enough to come out of his
5278640	5279640	chest.
5279640	5280640	Yeah.
5280640	5281640	That would work well.
5281640	5282640	I just fall right into the lava.
5282640	5283640	I'm going to rule.
5283640	5284640	You can do that.
5284640	5285640	All right.
5285640	5289160	If I cast, if I cast ray of frost on the lava underneath, underneath Tyler, can Tyler land
5289160	5290160	on the lava?
5290160	5295600	No, you have this thing called the staff of ice or something that also has ice powers,
5295600	5297440	but it's not a zero level spell.
5297440	5298440	Right.
5299040	5300040	Rod of frost.
5300040	5301040	Rod of frost.
5301040	5302040	That's the one.
5302040	5305240	If I, do you think that if I use that on the magma beneath his feet, that it would turn
5305240	5309640	it into a kind of regular stone, like he could make ice cream on it.
5309640	5312960	I want to do a camera take right now.
5312960	5316040	Who knows, man.
5316040	5321440	Rod of frost underneath Christopher's feet, bringing your rod of frost to bear.
5321440	5323080	You pulled the trigger.
5323080	5326200	It has a trigger on it.
5326200	5330000	Why don't you snow a seat?
5330000	5337360	I'll use my rod of rewrites later.
5337360	5341160	I'll throw it to a room.
5341160	5348960	A cold blue cone of emanating frosty energy sprays into the lava and it creates a thick
5348960	5351800	hard shell on the surface.
5351800	5352800	Yeah.
5352800	5353800	Yeah.
5354800	5360200	You know how the dinosaurs died.
5360200	5363920	It wasn't as most people maintain a giant meteor that hit the earth and cast enough
5363920	5367080	dust into the sky to cause the food chain to be disrupted.
5367080	5372040	It was the ice age.
5372040	5375520	You got there.
5375520	5376520	Ice to see it.
5376520	5377520	Ice to seat you.
5377520	5378520	Ice to seat you.
5378520	5381520	Ice to seat you.
5381520	5382520	We found it.
5382520	5383520	Who said that?
5384240	5385240	No kidding.
5385240	5388920	Well, yeah, but it's, I mean, come on, it literally is ice to seat you.
5388920	5389920	Thank you, sir.
5389920	5390920	That's great.
5390920	5391920	Ice to seat you.
5391920	5397200	Ice to, no, ice to seat you is better, Adam.
5397200	5398720	We have a winner.
5398720	5399720	It's not just a play on words.
5399720	5403280	It's like, I'm making ice to seat you.
5403280	5404560	There's no second place.
5404560	5405560	Come on.
5405560	5407440	It's great.
5407440	5412080	That's fantastic.
5412080	5414640	Putting it at quarks turn.
5414640	5419800	I take my mighty sword and do attack straight into a breathy's face parts.
5419800	5423680	You could cut the chain and I could fall into the ice too.
5423680	5424680	I want to kill this guy.
5424680	5425680	Yeah.
5425680	5427680	Because we don't know how long the ice and the lava is going to last.
5427680	5428680	There's still lava under there.
5428680	5429680	It can melt at any moment.
5429680	5430680	Yeah.
5430680	5431680	It's not a support workshop for you.
5431680	5436800	I mean, I did my part, you know, some of us are going to keep fighting the spider.
5436800	5441560	Listen, I was having a bad day and then I got a better mind of it and I went, wait,
5441560	5444320	maybe this isn't such a great idea that I charged to him and said, why don't you throw
5444320	5446000	a chain into me?
5446000	5453040	Oh, you need to stop talking.
5453040	5454040	Call back.
5454040	5455880	Mighty sword attack on preppy.
5455880	5459600	Striking directly in his robot face.
5459600	5464360	You deal, but a mere nine damage with my plus 11 attack bonus.
5464360	5465360	I guess not.
5465360	5468440	I thought it was plus six plus 11 bro.
5468440	5469440	Jesus Christ.
5469440	5470440	Yeah.
5470440	5471440	Broken.
5472320	5473320	14 damage.
5473320	5474320	Yeah.
5474320	5475320	Yeah.
5475320	5476320	Stay in the game, Spencer.
5476320	5477320	I mean, you have the sheet.
5477320	5478320	That's true.
5478320	5479320	Yeah.
5479320	5480320	But you live with these sheets.
5480320	5481320	You take them home.
5481320	5483720	I assume that you just like you have wallpaper in your bathroom made up of these things.
5483720	5487240	No, I write the episode while I'm driving to work.
5487240	5491840	I mean, driving, driving to Harmon town, never see these sheets.
5491840	5492840	It's not true.
5492840	5493840	All right.
5493840	5496600	So, so he's 14 damage.
5496600	5497600	Oh yeah.
5497600	5498600	Okay.
5498600	5504680	But Christopher's turn who we last left swinging invisibly on a chain.
5504680	5505680	Okay.
5505680	5507520	Uh, there's ice beneath me.
5507520	5509520	I could try to cut the chain and fall.
5509520	5512320	I see you.
5512320	5513320	We heard it.
5513320	5514320	The first time.
5514320	5515320	Sorry.
5515320	5516320	Uh, my cold.
5516320	5517320	I don't know.
5517320	5528760	I'm going to still try to grab a chain.
5528760	5529760	How long is it?
5529760	5530760	Rod of Frost.
5530760	5531760	Keep you as Arnold Schwarzenegger.
5531760	5532760	Too long.
5532760	5533760	Too long.
5533760	5536920	I would still like to try to swing.
5536920	5539760	I guess when you grab a chain for the first part of my action.
5539760	5540760	Okay.
5540760	5541760	Yeah.
5541760	5542760	That happens.
5542760	5544520	You grab onto the chain at the crest of your swingingness.
5544520	5545520	Okay.
5545520	5548040	Um, do I have a free hand?
5548040	5549880	You got one free.
5549880	5550880	Okay.
5550880	5557320	Uh, I'd like to use, um, my wire saw, I have a wire saw here, try to see if I can cut this
5557320	5559280	chain off of me.
5559280	5560280	Okay.
5560280	5564920	Uh, I, since all this stuff you've been doing is like takes all these turns, I'm just going
5564920	5567040	to tell you, you could do that, but it'll take two turns.
5567040	5569120	Do you want to start or do you want to try something else?
5569120	5572480	But I need to get this chain off of me because they're going to burn off all his legs and
5572480	5573480	they don't give a shit.
5573480	5574680	I just thought it would be fair to warn you.
5574680	5575680	Okay.
5575680	5576680	Let's do it.
5576680	5577680	Let's give a shit.
5577680	5578680	By the way.
5578680	5579680	Hey, I'm going to be doing this thing.
5579680	5580680	Don't kill me.
5580680	5581680	I'm invisible.
5581680	5582680	Don't.
5582680	5583680	Don't.
5583680	5584680	Thank you.
5584680	5589240	You begin the noble work of sawing away your chains, putting it at Brefi's turn.
5589240	5593680	His head continues to spin around and his eyes kind of turn blue.
5593680	5600700	He emits a brilliant flash of blue light and you guys all feel a little weird.
5600700	5604200	Because we can tell how ashamed of himself he is.
5604200	5608200	That's the blue light of self-awareness.
5608200	5612680	Christopher feels sick to his stomach, but continues his sawing maneuvers.
5612680	5617480	The rest of you are unaffected, putting it at Mulrain's turn.
5617480	5625480	Well, I think I'm going to do the thing I was doing before, which is sorry, second language.
5625480	5628520	Do it in Spanish.
5628520	5630560	Muy bueno.
5630560	5635180	That was almost racist.
5635180	5637760	Not if you say it.
5637760	5646160	Okay, so I'm going to shoot three more arrows to another, like because somebody has to actually
5646160	5647520	try to get the spiders.
5647520	5649320	That's true.
5649320	5651200	You fired three arrows.
5651200	5657380	Two of them fall into the, I guess they don't fall into, they hit the hard lava crusty floor.
5657380	5661660	The other one does, however, strike true, hitting him directly in the eye and dealing
5661660	5662660	eight damage.
5662660	5663660	Nice.
5663660	5664660	Oh, okay.
5664660	5665660	Yay.
5665660	5670020	You see his robot metal eye shatter, it stops glowing blue.
5670020	5671020	Yeah.
5671020	5673620	Doing my job.
5673620	5675980	Putting it at Sharpie's turn.
5675980	5682260	Okay, everybody, let's just take a step back.
5682260	5686600	I'm kind of busy right now, Sharpie.
5686600	5692240	I ... fuck him.
5692240	5694480	What does Rod of the Serpent do?
5694480	5695480	Fuck him.
5695480	5696560	It turns into a serpent.
5696560	5697560	All right.
5697560	5700240	That's impressive as that would be right now.
5700240	5701240	That's fucking magic, dude.
5701240	5703240	It's kind of Old Testament, doesn't it?
5703240	5704240	Yeah.
5704240	5707400	I mean, there's a time and a place for the Rod of the Serpent.
5707400	5710280	It's a more subtle political atmosphere than this.
5710280	5712760	No one's going to take notice.
5712760	5714760	Okay.
5715760	5721440	Suppose I use my Rod of Frost on Brefi's head.
5721440	5723480	Just ... wait, sun rod.
5723480	5724480	How many rods do I have?
5724480	5730440	I'm just walking around with like a ... I just have a stack of firewood and I ... What's
5730440	5731440	the sun rod?
5731440	5732440	Do you remember that?
5732440	5733440	That's like a flashlight.
5733440	5734440	Oh, okay.
5734440	5737840	All right, we'll hang out of that.
5737840	5738840	Okay.
5738840	5744600	All right, there's one more ... All right.
5745600	5747600	I'm going to use the Rod of Frost on Brefi's.
5747600	5748600	Okay.
5748600	5754600	Bringing to bear your Rod of Frost, you pointed at him and pulled the trigger.
5754600	5760240	Several shards of ice kind of fire out like a grape shot into his head.
5760240	5763240	You snows, you lose.
5763240	5765680	Wow.
5765680	5771280	You had a whole round to think of that, but I swear to God, I just thought of it now.
5771280	5773280	I promise.
5773280	5774280	That came across.
5775280	5776280	What?
5776280	5778280	He meets his chilling fate.
5778280	5780280	No, no, no.
5780280	5782280	Let's not turn on each other.
5784280	5785280	All right, come on.
5785280	5786280	Okay, okay.
5786280	5787280	Look, they cannot be good.
5787280	5788280	They cannot be good.
5788280	5790280	We already had one terrible frost pun.
5790280	5791280	We don't need more.
5791280	5794280	It's almost always like ice buns that we get stuck on.
5794280	5797280	Well, because there's a heavy tradition of that with that movie.
5797280	5798280	It's amazing.
5798280	5803280	That YouTube clip of all of Arnold's ice buns in a row is fantastic.
5803280	5805280	And you can't remember any of them.
5805280	5807280	Well, there's the one about the dinosaurs.
5807280	5810280	Like, you know how the dinosaurs died?
5810280	5811280	The ice age.
5811280	5813280	It's like, wait a minute.
5813280	5815280	The only thing anyone remembers is ice to meet you.
5815280	5816280	Like, do you remember any of it?
5816280	5818280	I don't remember any of the other ones.
5818280	5820280	Just chill out.
5820280	5821280	Yeah.
5823280	5825280	It wasn't an invitation.
5825280	5827280	I'm Detective Don Kimble.
5829280	5830280	I'm sorry I said anything.
5830280	5831280	He said that.
5831280	5833280	Detective Don Kimble?
5834280	5839280	Gentlemen, a cold meeting is about to happen.
5846280	5847280	All right.
5847280	5849280	What the fuck happened?
5849280	5851280	I'm sorry.
5851280	5854280	A lot of terrible puns.
5854280	5858280	It dealt 13 damage to Kathy's face head.
5859280	5862280	Ice to face head.
5862280	5868280	And you see his other eye kind of start to flicker and go out.
5868280	5874280	And his head starts to twitch a bit like a person's twitching might look.
5874280	5875280	Yeah.
5875280	5879280	And then he begins to fall into the drink.
5879280	5882280	I'm not done sawing yet.
5882280	5883280	Help.
5883280	5885280	You're on his back still.
5885280	5889280	That's why I jump and I use the spell jump.
5890280	5893280	Nah, you can't cast that, but you can't jump normal style.
5893280	5895280	I jump normal style.
5895280	5896280	Okay.
5897280	5903280	Jumping off of him as he falls, he crashes to the crusty lava floor.
5903280	5905280	And he hits with a thump.
5905280	5908280	And you see cracks begin to appear in this lava floor.
5908280	5910280	How long is this chain detaching him?
5911280	5915280	Well, as he falls, you know, you're sawing viciously at this chain.
5915280	5920280	And the impact combined with all this sign, all this hard work you've done,
5920280	5923280	causes the chain to snap right at the point of sign.
5923280	5924280	Wow.
5924280	5925280	Yeah.
5925280	5927280	It's all convenient shit.
5929280	5931280	Is Breffi alive or dead?
5931280	5935280	He's not quite dead, but he's also not moving.
5935280	5939280	You see cracks develop in the lava floor and they get wider.
5939280	5942280	Is there a time for me?
5942280	5947280	How much time do I have before this lava consumes him?
5947280	5949280	Starting to consume them as we speak.
5949280	5952280	You're going to have to, you're going to have to, this rope.
5953280	5954280	Shit.
5954280	5956280	I mean, how bad do I want to fuck Breffi again?
5957280	5959280	I mean, this, I'll throw you a rope.
5959280	5960280	This is risky.
5960280	5961280	I have one hand on it.
5961280	5962280	The chain's free.
5962280	5963280	Okay.
5963280	5965280	I against, against everything I believe in.
5965280	5967280	I tie a rope to myself.
5968280	5972280	And I fasten it to the chain and around my chest and I swing down.
5972280	5976280	As I'm swinging, this is going to be a hard combat maneuver.
5978280	5984280	I unzip my, I take my, I loosen my pants and I try this to give him a quick one as I swing by.
5988280	5989280	Or no, no.
5989280	5990280	I just, I go down like mission impossible.
5990280	5996280	Like I got, and I come down, my arms outstretched and my, my boners straight down.
5997280	6002280	And I try to like, I try to just like become like a spider, which is like, it looks like.
6002280	6004280	Consumed by passion.
6004280	6008280	Your rope tying skills aren't what they usually are.
6008280	6012280	And as you lower yourself in perfect raping position,
6014280	6018280	the rope slips and you fall directly onto the corpse of Breffi.
6018280	6019280	Okay.
6019280	6020280	I fuck him real fast.
6022280	6024280	As he sinks into the hot lava.
6024280	6025280	Oh no.
6025280	6026280	I jump back off.
6027280	6029280	Or do you fuck him real fast?
6029280	6030280	Shit.
6031280	6032280	Give me a second.
6032280	6033280	How fast are you?
6033280	6034280	Give me a second.
6035280	6036280	We need a number.
6036280	6037280	Somebody throw me a rope.
6037280	6039280	I already offered to throw him rope.
6039280	6040280	I have a free hand now.
6040280	6041280	Let me throw him a rope.
6041280	6042280	I have a rope.
6042280	6043280	Do you have rope?
6043280	6044280	I have a 150 feet of rope.
6044280	6045280	Okay, cool.
6045280	6047280	I grab the rope and.
6047280	6048280	I know this is important.
6048280	6049280	I know.
6049280	6051280	Can I throw in my button staff?
6051280	6056280	That staff that has the button on it, that when you press the button, it stays in place.
6056280	6057280	Okay.
6057280	6058280	Rope.
6058280	6060280	Rope and button staff coming at you, Quark.
6060280	6061280	I grab the.
6061280	6062280	I grab.
6062280	6063280	It's the button staff.
6063280	6064280	It's got the button on it.
6064280	6066280	I grab the button staff and I hold onto it.
6066280	6070280	And it's kind of like Indiana Jones when he's looking like, do I take the idol or do I let
6070280	6071280	the thing close?
6071280	6075280	And he's going down and I grab the button staff and I fuck him real quick.
6075280	6077280	And then I jump onto the staff.
6078280	6080280	And and shit.
6080280	6081280	I need a line.
6081280	6082280	Give me a line.
6082280	6083280	You look amazing.
6084280	6085280	Hater.
6087280	6088280	I'm a lava, not a fighter.
6090280	6091280	I'm a lava.
6093280	6095280	That's the best reaction you can hope for with a pun.
6097280	6099280	I have the hots for that spider.
6101280	6102280	Yeah.
6102280	6103280	That that that was appropriate.
6103280	6104280	Thank you, guys.
6105280	6106280	Yeah.
6106280	6107280	That's such a downer, man.
6107280	6108280	Yeah.
6108280	6109280	Okay.
6109280	6112280	So if I fuck him and I jump back on, I can hold onto the rod and the rope.
6112280	6113280	Yeah.
6113280	6115280	And so he's now does he go away into the lava?
6115280	6116280	I mean.
6118280	6120280	Touching the button on the button staff.
6120280	6126280	You extend the staff as it pierces through the crusty lava layer and into the molten
6126280	6127280	lava.
6127280	6132280	You don't know what's happening for a while, but then you feel yourself rising up on the
6132280	6134280	staff into the chains.
6134280	6139280	You get into the chains, but then the staff becomes hot in your hands.
6139280	6140280	Too hot to touch.
6140280	6141280	I grab a chain.
6141280	6146280	You grab the chain as the staff melts into molten metal.
6146280	6147280	Worth it.
6147280	6148280	Sludge.
6149280	6153280	Before he even says anything, I give him a look that says worth it.
6153280	6154280	Yeah.
6155280	6157280	You did the right thing.
6158280	6161280	As it drifts under the lava.
6161280	6163280	You just did what we were all thinking, man.
6163280	6165280	Once bitten, twice die.
6168280	6169280	No.
6170280	6171280	No.
6171280	6172280	I fucked you twice.
6173280	6175280	I showed up at the ceiling.
6175280	6177280	You like that Admiral Darkstar?
6178280	6179280	Is that all you got?
6181280	6182280	Is that all you got?
6183280	6185280	And the camera pulls out.
6186280	6188280	Is that all you got?
6189280	6191280	Thank you for coming to Harman Town, everybody.
6193280	6194280	Thank you very much.
6194280	6196280	Thank you, community fans, for coming tonight.

6202280	6203280	Thank you, Catherine.
6203280	6204280	Thank you, Julieta.
6204280	6205280	Thank you all.
6205280	6209280	Thank you for your wonderful help with the puns.
6209280	6211280	One more time for Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
6214280	6216280	I'm Jeff Davis, your Comptroller.
6216280	6219280	And again, keep it going for your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.
6219280	6220280	God bless you.
