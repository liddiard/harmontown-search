0	4000	Tell me, baby, why you been gone so long, you been gone so long
4000	6000	For Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California,
6000	9000	Herman Town is now in session.
9000	13000	Tell me, baby, why you been gone so long, you been gone so long
13000	17000	Don't roll these scratches at my door
17000	19000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Herman Town,
19000	21000	Mr. Dan Harmon.
21000	25000	Tell me, baby, why you been gone so long
25000	27000	Thank you.
27000	29000	Look who's back.
29000	31000	Councilor Jeff Davis, everybody.
39000	43000	I think they missed you from informal polls on Twitter.
43000	45000	I wouldn't go on Reddit.
45000	47000	I don't want to go on there.
47000	50000	There's too much objective, clinical...
50000	52000	I don't think Reddit wants you on Reddit.
52000	54000	If you're being talked about on Reddit.
54000	56000	Reddit doesn't want...
56000	58000	The town of Ferguson, to be on Reddit,
58000	60000	it wants to talk about...
60000	63000	Because if it would get out, it would go,
63000	65000	hey, we're a real town.
65000	69000	But just from Twitter, every time I would go like,
69000	71000	hey, we're doing the show tonight,
71000	74000	there's always a minimum of three or four, like, obnoxious,
74000	76000	like, and Jeff.
76000	78000	So it's good you're back.
78000	80000	Thank you, Dan. It's good to be here.
80000	82000	The Lions are the Lions.
87000	89000	And I missed you as well. I'm glad you're back.
89000	91000	I missed you.
91000	93000	And I was doing what they call playing hard to get.
93000	96000	It's good. It makes a relationship stronger.
96000	100000	In that Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus book,
100000	102000	I remember the guy describing said,
102000	104000	women are waves...
104000	106000	This is no longer politically correct to say.
106000	108000	Women are anything.
108000	112000	You could say women are porpoises.
112000	114000	It sounds bad now.
114000	116000	But women are waves. They go up and down.
116000	118000	And men are rubber bands. They go back and forth.
118000	120000	They pull away.
120000	122000	And if you let them pull away, they snap back.
122000	128000	Sounds like a big justification for a lot of hoo-ha.
128000	130000	Written by a dude.
130000	132000	But I don't know. I feel it.
132000	137000	I feel myself stretching back and snapping back sometimes.
137000	143000	Also, police brutality is like a rubber band.
143000	147000	If you let it go, it just stretches and stretches.
147000	151000	Also, if you put it on too tight, it constricts you and you die.
151000	153000	Yeah.
153000	161000	Well, I mean, it's not the goal to be sensitive in these times around this subject.
161000	165000	I do want to be a curmudgeon. Let's do the cane shaking segment.
165000	167000	Cane shaking segment.
167000	170000	I want to do more segments now that we're on video.
170000	172000	Cane shaking segment.
173000	176000	He's got a cane and he wants to shake it.
176000	184000	He's mad because you are young and he's old and he wants you off to the world's lawn.
184000	189000	Knock it off. Stop being so young all the time.
189000	198000	I can't walk, so I'm shaking this thing that I use to help me walk.
198000	204000	Dan, it's good to be back.
204000	212000	So, I was listening to a police advocacy lawyer, which is a great gig these days.
212000	216000	It's the hourlies.
216000	223000	The police advocacy lawyer at NPR, they were talking about the Garner autopsy
223000	227000	and how the pathologist ruled it a homicide.
227000	231000	And the lawyer's response was, you know, well,
231000	235000	homicide just means that one person's life was ended by another person.
235000	240000	It doesn't mean a crime was committed.
240000	242000	And he's right, I guess.
242000	247000	But it just really leapt out at me and this is called the cane shaking segment
247000	249000	so you can't get mad at me for connecting these dots.
249000	253000	I wanted to roll down the window and shout at them.
253000	256000	Get you.
256000	260000	This is where refinement of language, these are your bedfellows.
260000	262000	These are the people who speak perfectly.
262000	264000	These are the people who are very polite.
264000	268000	They always mean exactly what they're saying, or rather they never do.
268000	270000	But they never say the wrong thing.
270000	272000	They never use the wrong words.
272000	274000	And they're advocates of murderers.
274000	276000	But it's not murder, it's homicide.
276000	280000	So get your shit together and get off my lawn.
280000	286000	It's kind of a rare, it's a weird moment in the news right now,
286000	291000	like a strange harmonic convergence where it kind of actually feels
291000	296000	like the things that are in the news right now are the things
296000	299000	that the news is usually distracting us from.
299000	302000	The death of journalism is in the news right now,
302000	306000	which is the most important thing to be in the news since the death of journalism.
306000	311000	The Rolling Stone thing is a hot button.
311000	316000	I won't touch it, but it has brought the concept of journalism dying
316000	320000	and what responsibilities are and how journalism actually works
320000	324000	to a generation that seems to maybe justifiably because of the new media
324000	327000	overwhelming them with an increased news cycle.
327000	330000	There's a lot of old disciplines that have been forgotten,
330000	334000	confirmation of sources and things.
334000	337000	There's still good journalists out there, but let's face it,
337000	342000	the worlds that we used to call tabloid and all these things,
342000	344000	we used to have different compartments for these things.
344000	347000	And since the 20s, they've all been kind of merging.
347000	350000	It's a gradual slow thing that spiked with the internet.
350000	355000	What the hell is the difference between real news and real news sites?
355000	359000	They still have the same fucking weird clickbait stuff.
359000	360000	They can't tell the difference.
360000	364000	But now that cops are choking people to death
364000	368000	and there's cameras everywhere, I don't know.
368000	373000	Do you think maybe there would be a little Golden Age resurgence of journalistic integrity?
373000	378000	There's crazy shit happening.
378000	386000	It's becoming very clear that being a team player isn't necessarily the secret to world peace.
386000	393000	What would you call the Golden Age looking back of journalism?
393000	395000	Oh, definitely, 1985.
395000	401000	I read you the following review of Back to the Future,
401000	408000	scintillating with his beautiful locks of gossip and hair.
408000	410000	I told you when I walked out of Back to the Future,
410000	412000	I was in New York as a kid in 1985.
412000	414000	Was that when it was?
415000	418000	It was a mnemonic device. The whole movie's about 1985.
418000	421000	I told you this, right? I walked out of the theater
421000	424000	and everybody poured out of this Lowe's theater in New York on the west side
424000	427000	and everybody was like beaming. Everybody was so happy.
427000	429000	We almost kind of walked out holding hands.
429000	433000	It was the most together you ever saw in New Yorkers in my life.
433000	437000	And they walked out and some guy was like, he was kind of like,
437000	441000	I put him probably at 35. I was like 11 at the time or 10, 11.
441000	444000	And this guy just kind of shook his head like, you know, kind of happily.
444000	448000	He goes, Spielberg did it again.
448000	452000	And we all kind of paused. He kind of ruined the moment,
452000	455000	but we all were like, yeah, he fucking did it.
455000	459000	He presented it again.
459000	461000	That screenplay took seven years to write, by the way.
461000	465000	Get off my lawn. It took seven years to write.
465000	469000	You can't just shit these things out.
470000	472000	When is your screenplay coming out then?
472000	475000	It's seven years and it'll be good.
475000	480000	And men stretch back. You've got to let them stretch back.
480000	482000	It's just a pulpit for my agenda.
482000	486000	People shouldn't have to get milk.
486000	489000	It's bad for you.
489000	493000	Someone asked me to get milk.
493000	496000	I heard someone say what? The gassed what?
496000	499000	I'm just explaining.
499000	507000	All right, so I don't want to do a homicidal cop spree segment.
507000	511000	Yeah, I do. Okay, let's do it.
511000	513000	Do you want new music for that?
513000	514000	Yeah.
514000	518000	Okay, let's do, shit, let's find something good here.
518000	521000	Let's do...
526000	530000	Well, your job ain't just to kill people
530000	534000	before they commit the crime.
534000	536000	Sometimes you... Oh, who's this guy?
536000	538000	Shoot him.
544000	547000	He had a gun.
547000	550000	He came in on the first verse. He was reaching into his waistband.
550000	552000	He was just singing about a woman.
552000	554000	I saw him reaching.
555000	557000	You shot him there. He was reaching.
557000	560000	He had a big red gun made of intestine.
560000	562000	No, that was a guitar pick. Dan, that was a guitar pick.
562000	565000	No.
565000	569000	This is local. Hollywood and Highland, these two cops shot a guy.
569000	571000	I know nothing about this.
571000	575000	I'm going to put a kind of laughably afterthought thing,
575000	577000	but it's genuinely offered.
577000	579000	I do know that there are...
579000	583000	Cops must have it really bad right now all over the place,
583000	585000	many of whom do not deserve it.
585000	588000	It's in the zeitgeist right now that cops are terrible people
588000	590000	and blah, blah, blah.
590000	592000	There are people who still have to get up in the morning
592000	594000	and put on a badge and go to work.
594000	596000	There was a crazy guy outside my front gate today,
596000	598000	and I immediately remembered,
598000	600000	holy shit, I need the fucking place.
600000	602000	There's a million good ones,
602000	604000	and I've met good, good, good people
604000	607000	that also happen to go to work and risk their lives to be a cop.
607000	610000	It doesn't seem like the time or the place for that disclaimer,
610000	612000	but it also feels compelled to create that balance
612000	614000	because it's easy to fan the flames right now.
614000	617000	Anyways, I know nothing about how the LAPD is doing.
617000	620000	I know nothing about since Rodney King, the Department of Justice,
620000	622000	took over the LAPD, they restructured it.
622000	624000	I don't know where we're at with that.
624000	626000	Someone in the audience might know more about it.
626000	629000	And I don't know what the crime rate, how it was impacted.
629000	631000	I don't know how much of that is phony.
631000	633000	I don't know what's going on,
633000	637000	but I do know that we were all praying when we heard the cops shot a guy
637000	639000	in LA in the midst of all this.
640000	645000	One of the writers at Community voiced this and said,
645000	648000	confessingly, confessionally,
648000	651000	I've never found myself just saying,
651000	654000	please, God, let them have killed a white man.
654000	657000	The city just doesn't need it.
657000	662000	The rain is fucking with our infrastructure.
662000	664000	It's hard to drive right now.
664000	666000	There's all that oil after a drought, and the cars are sliding.
666000	668000	Don't kill any black people.
669000	671000	We just don't need it to happen.
671000	675000	And it looked from the photos like a white enough guy,
675000	677000	so we're all fine.
677000	682000	Not that I see race, there's a split street now.
682000	683000	You don't see race, Dan?
683000	684000	No, I don't.
684000	686000	Who's that? What's that guy?
686000	688000	He's got a red hat, that's what he is.
688000	690000	That's Anatoly, we know him.
690000	691000	Who's that guy?
691000	693000	He's exotic, that's it.
695000	697000	Stand up, show him how exotic you are.
698000	699000	Whoa.
700000	702000	That's all I see is the word exotic.
702000	704000	What nationality are you?
704000	708000	I am Native Colombian and East Indian.
708000	709000	Native Colombian and East Indian,
709000	712000	but you have hair like a sexy Michael Landon.
712000	714000	That's great, I love that.
714000	715000	It is sexy beathered hair.
715000	716000	That's okay to say, right?
716000	719000	You've got great Warren Beatty shampoo hair,
719000	721000	it's really good.
721000	725000	We all want to run our fingers with this guy's hair.
725000	726000	Get over here.
726000	728000	I'm going to run my fingers.
730000	732000	Jesus Christ, that's good.
733000	735000	Can we pass him around like a bag of popcorn
735000	737000	and just have everybody do that?
737000	740000	I mean, that sounds...
742000	743000	Racist?
743000	746000	It's honestly, obviously depends on him.
746000	749000	You want to go around, have people run their fingers through your hair?
749000	750000	Just the front row, maybe?
750000	752000	Just the front row, maybe.
752000	755000	I say people raise your hand if you want to feel his hair.
756000	759000	It shouldn't be compulsory.
759000	762000	Colombian and East Indian?
762000	765000	That's a good combo for hair.
765000	768000	Okay, we've crossed the line into breeding.
768000	769000	That's good, that's good.
769000	771000	How are you with kids?
775000	779000	Can I trust you to take the prey down without piercing the throat?
779000	780000	You'll just hold it?
780000	782000	Wait, now you've made him a dog.
782000	784000	Well, that's the analogy.
784000	787000	I was just saying his coat is so soft and manageable.
789000	792000	With that particular combination, yes.
794000	796000	They've got to let golden doodles into the dog shows, by the way.
796000	797000	I've got a fucking golden doodle.
797000	800000	These things deserve to be recognized as the throw bread that they are.
800000	802000	Okay, all right.
802000	804000	My golden doodle is amazing.
804000	805000	See, I watch that dog show.
805000	807000	Those are bullshit dogs.
807000	808000	The dogs are all fucked up.
808000	809000	They're all weird looking.
809000	811000	Let my golden doodle in the dog show.
811000	815000	All right, moving on.
815000	818000	There's a split screen online, a photograph.
818000	820000	There's the two cops.
820000	824000	Boy, they look cool.
824000	826000	The cops look like movie cops.
826000	829000	They really look like they're posing.
829000	830000	Which movie?
830000	833000	No, this is the guy that got shot on Hollywood in Highland.
833000	836000	Somebody just brought through the photo up in the writer's room today.
836000	838000	So this is all I've seen.
838000	841000	I'm not a journalist, and don't please forgive me for whatever.
841000	842000	You talk about it online.
842000	845000	But they brought up a photo.
845000	846000	It was a split screen.
846000	851000	On the left side is a photo that was taken by just a bystander,
851000	854000	who was there at the moment when this guy got shot.
854000	857000	There's a guy that's down in the crosswalk,
857000	861000	and his face is facing the camera, I think.
861000	865000	It's Hollywood in Highland, and the two cops braced,
865000	869000	and obviously scared, and they just did this thing.
869000	872000	And on the right side is the crime scene photograph.
872000	875000	After everything's been cataloged, and the guy's sitting there,
875000	879000	it's the same scene, but there's little evidence markers everywhere,
879000	881000	like in the TV shows.
881000	883000	And one of the more prominent ones is this evidence marker
883000	887000	of this knife that the guy had, which is not in the left photo.
887000	889000	It doesn't seem to be in the left photo.
889000	893000	It seems like the left photo is just a dead guy in a crosswalk,
893000	896000	and then the right photo, there's this knife that's there.
896000	898000	That's what it seems like.
898000	904000	I don't want to amplify things that are already not true,
904000	906000	but I'm reporting on the gossip.
906000	907000	I'm not reporting...
907000	908000	What day was this?
908000	910000	I was in Europe, and I didn't see any news.
910000	912000	I'm completely unaware of all of this.
912000	915000	I've now dumped everything that I heard today.
915000	916000	Somebody just threw up the photo.
916000	918000	So Hollywood and Highland?
918000	920000	Both.
920000	923000	On that very corner, you mean?
923000	925000	Isn't that where our Hollywood High School is?
925000	926000	No.
926000	929000	No, no, that's for the... That's Sunset, right? Yeah.
929000	932000	A friend of mine, you know Chris Dermick?
932000	933000	Our buddy from...
933000	934000	I met him.
934000	935000	Yeah, Comedy Sports Days.
935000	938000	He was driving down Hollywood past...
938000	940000	On Highland, past Hollywood, down to Sunset, where Hollywood High is,
940000	943000	and he came to a stop at the intersection there,
943000	947000	and he was two or three cars behind the red light waiting there,
947000	949000	and kids were getting out of school,
949000	952000	and the car in front of him, a dude got out of a car.
952000	955000	A young Latino kid got out, took a gun, walked up to a kid standing there,
955000	958000	went bang, bang, shot him twice in the chest,
958000	961000	got back in the car, and waited for the light to turn green.
961000	962000	Oof.
962000	963000	And nobody...
963000	966000	Sounds like a Time Life book about the Old West or something.
966000	968000	Everyone's just like...
968000	970000	No one did anything because the guy's got a gun.
970000	972000	Everyone just waited for the light to turn green,
972000	974000	and they drove off, but not just...
974000	977000	Didn't just drive off, politely waited for the light to turn green
977000	980000	and drive safely away from the murder scene.
980000	981000	Right.
981000	984000	So then, you know, that is the world in which police work,
984000	987000	and that's what gets brought up in the comment sections on the other side
987000	989000	when we're all going like, this is crazy.
989000	990000	We're losing our minds.
990000	992000	What is going on?
992000	996000	The other side is saying like, it's a jungle out there, and it's crazy,
996000	998000	and it's, you know, like they're risking their lives,
998000	1001000	and nobody is wrong about any of this stuff,
1001000	1003000	but I think the only...
1003000	1005000	The person I'm gonna go with, and I'm putting a ribbon on this
1005000	1006000	so I can move forward,
1006000	1008000	because I don't want to just like jump into this and go...
1008000	1010000	And then like run out.
1010000	1012000	I just want to put a little ribbon on it.
1012000	1014000	It's my...
1014000	1016000	The way I'm looking at it right now,
1016000	1019000	because what we learned from the Garner thing is that this whole...
1019000	1022000	Like, God bless their fucking patient, heroic souls
1022000	1026000	that Michael Brown family, you read their statement about
1026000	1029000	when the verdict came out, and they just...
1029000	1031000	You know, it was just...
1031000	1034000	Like, I don't understand a human being that could respond that way
1034000	1036000	in this situation,
1036000	1040000	but they were heavily emphasizing like the need for cameras.
1040000	1043000	Cameras, cameras, cameras on these cops.
1043000	1046000	It's a hard job. Crazy shit happens for everyone's good.
1046000	1048000	We live in a surveillance state anyway.
1048000	1051000	Why aren't there just cameras all over these people
1051000	1054000	that are out there risking their lives and protecting us
1054000	1058000	so that we don't have to have these fucking crazy arguments?
1058000	1062000	But the Garner thing is on camera,
1062000	1064000	and it's like you watch a guy get killed,
1064000	1067000	and it doesn't really matter that much.
1067000	1069000	So what is the important thing?
1069000	1071000	What is our takeaway?
1071000	1073000	Why am I...
1073000	1075000	Like, no other podcast can talk about this?
1075000	1077000	What is my role in this world?
1077000	1078000	What the fuck...
1078000	1081000	Let's talk about community in a second.
1081000	1084000	What is your role? Why is it on your mind?
1084000	1086000	It's not everyone's mind,
1086000	1088000	so I'm just talking about what's on everyone's mind.
1088000	1090000	I sound like I'm speaking with authority
1090000	1093000	because I'm speaking to a microphone and no one else is responding.
1093000	1095000	I am just awash in the sea of this,
1095000	1097000	so it just sounds like I'm pontificating.
1097000	1103000	I am pontificating, but I'm not drawing on any kind of decisions that I've made.
1103000	1107000	My current takeaway is just what this young lady said on NPR.
1107000	1110000	It was like I think we really need to seriously examine
1110000	1115000	the way that we look at the role of police and the law.
1115000	1118000	We have this philosophy evolving
1118000	1122000	where we think that the first and most important thing is compliance
1122000	1125000	and that if we have that, then laws won't be broken
1125000	1127000	because everyone will be afraid of the police.
1127000	1131000	And I think we're seeing about probably 60 years of that coming to...
1131000	1136000	The fruits of that are now just rotting and falling into the street
1136000	1140000	and it's on the inner tubes now because everyone's got these little dangly doodles.
1140000	1143000	And so we're seeing now...
1143000	1145000	It's just like, you know, it's weird.
1145000	1149000	It's weird to have six people respond to an untaxed cigarette sale.
1149000	1153000	It's give them a ticket and nothing would have happened.
1153000	1157000	Just give somebody a ticket for things that have to do with finance
1157000	1159000	and let money do its beautiful, beautiful work.
1159000	1163000	And when people are being physically assaulted,
1163000	1165000	then that's where the guns and the chokings
1165000	1167000	and the nunchucks and stuff should come out.
1167000	1170000	But I have no answers, but I have questions
1170000	1172000	and our questions should have to do with, first of all,
1172000	1174000	how many people get killed every year by cops?
1174000	1175000	I don't have the statistics.
1175000	1177000	And why does this happen?
1177000	1178000	And if we're going to be a federal nation,
1178000	1180000	maybe we should put the pedal to the metal
1180000	1183000	and just fucking federalize and be fucking federal about everything.
1183000	1185000	I never thought I'd say that, but Jesus Christ.
1185000	1189000	Well, get off your lawn indeed.
1189000	1192000	I want federal government!
1192000	1194000	Knock it off, you states!
1194000	1199000	I'm a bull mooser!
1199000	1203000	I don't think I had anything else on my ever note, unfortunately.
1204000	1206000	How is married life treating you?
1206000	1208000	Oh, it's great. It fits like a glove, man.
1208000	1213000	I should have been married a long time ago.
1213000	1218000	Because look at me. Look at this.
1218000	1221000	Can't do that single.
1221000	1223000	I know because I tried.
1223000	1225000	It's just a miracle I got married.
1225000	1227000	What do you notice is different about you as a person
1227000	1230000	from being recently single to recently married?
1230000	1231000	I'm relaxed. I think that, you know,
1231000	1233000	the important thing about marriage is,
1233000	1236000	and I was actually talking to an ex-girlfriend about this
1236000	1238000	who was recently married and is now pregnant,
1238000	1243000	and so we were having a little, like, denouement.
1243000	1248000	Like, the important thing about getting married
1248000	1254000	is the realization that not the other person now can't leave.
1254000	1257000	It's that you don't want to.
1257000	1261000	I know that sounds like a silly epiphany to have.
1261000	1263000	Logically, that's in the air.
1263000	1265000	But emotionally, it really kind of hits home
1265000	1266000	when you sit down.
1266000	1268000	For me, it was like I was writing my vows,
1268000	1269000	and I was like, you know,
1269000	1271000	this is an hour and a half of doing something
1271000	1273000	that I've never had to do before.
1273000	1274000	I'll never do again.
1274000	1277000	What am I actually promising going into this union,
1277000	1279000	and what do I feel, and what's my job?
1279000	1282000	And all of a sudden, this is just sort of, like,
1282000	1284000	clicking that happens, this docking
1284000	1287000	of two pieces of a space station, you know?
1287000	1289000	And it's...
1289000	1291000	Someone yelps.
1291000	1293000	Because it sounds like you're talking about fucking.
1293000	1294000	Well...
1298000	1300000	I think you delighted a lady back there.
1303000	1304000	Tell me more about marriage.
1304000	1308000	Marriage is when this thing slides into this other thing, and...
1309000	1310000	Oh!
1314000	1316000	It really is like a turn-of-the-century
1316000	1318000	comedy show tonight.
1319000	1321000	It just felt, you know, it feels like a...
1321000	1323000	Now you have a...
1323000	1327000	You know, you get to have a moment to yourself
1327000	1329000	where you're like, I want to...
1329000	1330000	I want to be married.
1330000	1331000	I want to be married to this person.
1331000	1332000	This person...
1332000	1334000	That whole thing about somebody's, you know,
1334000	1336000	accepting someone's flaws and all, like,
1336000	1338000	there is, like, this changeover
1338000	1341000	from a mode where something's wrong,
1341000	1344000	you come home, there's no toothpaste.
1344000	1346000	I thought we said we need a toothpaste for, like,
1346000	1348000	two weeks, and instead of, like, getting haunted
1348000	1350000	by the ghost of your dad and being like,
1350000	1352000	there's no toothpaste!
1352000	1354000	You're just kind of like, yeah, there's no toothpaste,
1354000	1356000	and I fucking signed up for this, I don't know.
1356000	1358000	It's just kind of like, what am I?
1358000	1359000	What am I, an idiot?
1359000	1361000	I married a woman that's not going to buy toothpaste?
1361000	1362000	I'm not an idiot, so there's no toothpaste.
1362000	1363000	Who gives a shit?
1363000	1365000	What do I have, an emotional fucking position about toothpaste?
1365000	1366000	Everything just calms down.
1366000	1368000	It sounds like you might have a buried issue about toothpaste.
1368000	1370000	I... well, I did.
1370000	1371000	I bring that up because that was like a thing
1371000	1373000	that was like an epiphany I had in the...
1373000	1374000	Whose job is toothpaste?
1374000	1376000	Is it a shared responsibility, or is it...
1376000	1377000	It's nobody's job.
1377000	1378000	Like, it's...
1378000	1379000	But that's why you have no toothpaste.
1379000	1382000	You've got to sign tasks.
1382000	1385000	More importantly, it's not going to end the world
1385000	1386000	if there's no toothpaste.
1386000	1390000	It's like worth a very specific toothpaste-sized moment
1390000	1392000	of grieving, as my couples therapist would say.
1392000	1396000	You grieve the amount that toothpaste deserves,
1396000	1399000	which is about that much compared to, like,
1399000	1401000	choking a black guy to death on a sidewalk.
1401000	1402000	Wow.
1402000	1404000	Way to tie it in. That was nice.
1404000	1405000	Yes, thank you.
1405000	1408000	Like, there's other stuff to get upset about.
1408000	1409000	You know, you don't have...
1409000	1411000	That doesn't mean that the toothpaste doesn't mean anything
1411000	1413000	because we live in a police state.
1413000	1419000	It just means that, like, you know, proportion out your grieving.
1419000	1421000	Like, what are you going to grieve about today?
1421000	1426000	How much grief are you going to spend on the toothpaste?
1426000	1430000	It sounds very romantic.
1430000	1432000	There was a crazy guy outside the gate.
1432000	1436000	I'm glad I got that gate.
1436000	1438000	The gate at your place?
1438000	1440000	But I'm glad I can call the police outside the gate.
1440000	1445000	Please come choke him.
1445000	1447000	The gate in front of your crib?
1447000	1449000	There was a crazy guy walking around?
1449000	1451000	He seems a little touched, I think.
1451000	1453000	Is that still a correct thing to say?
1453000	1454000	I was just in Paris.
1454000	1457000	I've never been to Paris before, and I've spent about a week there.
1457000	1460000	And the crazy people there are fucking great.
1460000	1462000	Like, when you see a crazy guy yelling in French,
1462000	1466000	it was like artwork. It was really good.
1466000	1472000	He's like, I can watch this all night long.
1472000	1476000	For all we know, Napoleon was homeless.
1477000	1480000	We're like, OK, whatever you say, sir.
1480000	1482000	I think they have more theatrical training.
1482000	1484000	I think this guy had a great voice.
1484000	1485000	He could scream all night.
1485000	1488000	Well, it's definitely a language that's, you know,
1488000	1492000	its wheelhouse is passionate exclamation.
1492000	1496000	Like, oh, Pepe Le Pew, that's what I'm basing on.
1496000	1498000	Pepe Le Pew never yelled like this guy.
1498000	1500000	I saw a couple of guys that were really laying it down.
1500000	1503000	It was like Arias. They were really riveting.
1503000	1504000	By the way, Pepe Le Pew,
1504000	1507000	when did we reexamine that through our new hashtag lens?
1507000	1509000	That is uncomfortable.
1509000	1513000	Yeah, we got rid of Speedy Gonzales, but we didn't get rid of Pepe Le Pew.
1513000	1519000	Let's have some agency for cats that get paint spilled on them.
1519000	1522000	Yeah, not only was it insensitive to French people that stink,
1522000	1525000	it was just the rapiest skunk in the world.
1525000	1527000	Was that the idea that French people stink?
1527000	1529000	Oh, yeah, Pepe Le Pew. French people have B.O.
1529000	1531000	That's absolutely what it is.
1531000	1533000	Oh, come on. That has to be it.
1533000	1535000	He was based on Charles Boyer.
1535000	1539000	Charles Boyer stink?
1539000	1541000	No, no, because he's a lover.
1541000	1543000	Oh, yeah, but also Pepe Le Pew,
1543000	1546000	the fact that he was a stinky Frenchman, that's, yeah.
1546000	1548000	But he said the raping thing.
1548000	1551000	He's based off an actor that would woo women, and he loved it.
1551000	1552000	Oh, certainly, yeah.
1552000	1554000	So the idea that French are lovers, absolutely.
1554000	1557000	But also, no, no, he was trying to fuck cats.
1557000	1565000	He was a cross-species rapier.
1565000	1568000	If a cat happened to walk by a white paintbrush
1568000	1572000	and looked like a skunkback, then she wasn't deep shit.
1572000	1576000	Yeah, and he window-dressed it with all of this romance,
1576000	1580000	but clearly we knew as an objective viewer that he was full of shit.
1580000	1585000	He did not take no for an answer.
1586000	1587000	He was very terrible.
1587000	1590000	And the way they drew the facial expressions on the cat,
1590000	1593000	it was very realistic.
1593000	1596000	Wouldn't you agree?
1596000	1599000	I remember as a kid, pre-hashtag culture,
1599000	1602000	I'm remembering being kind of a kid and being a little bit...
1602000	1605000	I didn't like the Pepe Le Pew cartoons,
1605000	1610000	and I didn't like the cat. She was so traumatized.
1610000	1612000	She was horrified, horrified.
1612000	1615000	She was looking for the exits. It was the worst.
1615000	1618000	And the thing is, you were never rooting for Pepe Le Pew.
1618000	1620000	You were always rooting for the...
1620000	1622000	Please get out of there.
1622000	1624000	I was never laughing at him either.
1624000	1625000	I just didn't think it was...
1625000	1628000	I think animals beating the shit out of each other is really funny.
1628000	1630000	Like, Tom and Jerry's amazing,
1630000	1632000	like the things they do to each other.
1632000	1633000	We know this.
1633000	1635000	All Pepe Le Pew everyone wants to do is go...
1635000	1636000	Do that, but that was...
1636000	1637000	And he just kept saying it.
1637000	1639000	Oh, I stroke you. I touch you.
1639000	1641000	You, my love, my love.
1641000	1643000	He'd do it over and over again.
1643000	1645000	I know Wylie Coyote would do the same thing over and over again too,
1645000	1647000	but with different equipment.
1647000	1649000	Yeah.
1649000	1650000	All right.
1650000	1653000	Speaking of which, what was the Roadrunner?
1653000	1655000	Was it Roadrunner male or female?
1655000	1656000	Callie, you're an animator.
1656000	1659000	Roadrunner, big eyelashes. Kind of feminine, maybe?
1659000	1660000	Male.
1660000	1662000	Roadrunner's a male. Do we know that for sure?
1662000	1664000	I think so. You look weird, though.
1664000	1666000	Callie, get up. You're an animator.
1666000	1667000	Callie Kazoo, everybody.
1667000	1669000	Callie Foncheccio.
1670000	1674000	Kind of like fantastic animator and artist extraordinaire.
1676000	1677000	Hello.
1677000	1678000	Hello, Callie.
1678000	1679000	Nice to see you.
1679000	1680000	Good to see you.
1680000	1682000	I was going to say, I think...
1682000	1685000	I'm pretty sure he's male, but it's weird over the years
1685000	1687000	if anyone's familiar with Tweety Bird.
1687000	1691000	He's male, but he's been systematically turned into a female.
1691000	1693000	Tweety Bird's male?
1693000	1695000	Yeah. So the Tweety...
1695000	1698000	The drawing of Tweety's actually based off a caricature
1698000	1700000	of Bob Clampett's baby photo.
1701000	1702000	It was a joke of, like,
1702000	1704000	Yo, you got this big, stupid head.
1704000	1705000	Really?
1705000	1706000	Yeah.
1706000	1708000	And he was male. He's male.
1708000	1709000	I guess you're right.
1709000	1712000	That was a really successfully androgynous character
1712000	1713000	because I never really thought about...
1713000	1714000	Because of marketing.
1714000	1715000	I'm kind of shocked to find out he's male,
1715000	1717000	but I would also be equally shocked to find out he's female
1717000	1720000	because I would be shocked to find out Tweety had a gender.
1720000	1723000	Because they realized they were selling a lot of products to women,
1723000	1726000	and then they slowly just kept putting more hearts and flowers,
1726000	1729000	and that's actually the last time I talked to someone
1729000	1730000	who works in marketing there.
1730000	1733000	That's their biggest thing of money that comes in.
1733000	1735000	Like, millions of dollars a year just on Tweety.
1735000	1737000	You go to Mexico, there's Tweety Bird merchandise.
1737000	1740000	Tweety Wanna is like Tweety Wanna.
1740000	1741000	I don't understand it.
1741000	1744000	There's, like, hookers standing up to their knees and shit
1744000	1746000	with roaches crawling on them,
1746000	1748000	horses spray-painted to look like zebras,
1748000	1750000	and Tweety Bird.
1750000	1752000	And I keep trying to figure it out.
1752000	1754000	Yeah, they love Tweety and Taz.
1755000	1757000	Oh, yeah, Taz.
1757000	1758000	And Popeye.
1758000	1759000	Popeye, really?
1759000	1762000	Yeah, there's so many, like, gangster Popeyes.
1762000	1765000	Wasn't there a moment when Perky Pig crossed over
1765000	1768000	into kind of very feminine too, like big long eyelashes?
1768000	1770000	Oh, they've all done that.
1770000	1772000	That's the running gag with all of them.
1772000	1775000	I mean, Bugs, half the time, is making out with characters.
1775000	1777000	Bugs is doing Groucho where Groucho plays a lady.
1777000	1780000	He's doing a character where he plays a woman all the time,
1780000	1782000	and Bart Simpson does that too.
1782000	1784000	But they started drawing.
1784000	1785000	We all do it.
1785000	1788000	Chuck Jones is the one who's famous for drawing everybody
1788000	1790000	with, like, very effeminate eyelashes.
1790000	1792000	That was his gag, I guess.
1792000	1794000	Like, most of his cartoons have that.
1794000	1796000	And you can see that even in, like, the Grinch movie
1796000	1797000	that he did.
1797000	1799000	Everyone's got the, like, big eyelashes.
1799000	1800000	How do we get off on this?
1800000	1801000	What are we talking about?
1801000	1802000	I have no idea.
1802000	1803000	Oh, we're talking about Pimplepew.
1803000	1805000	He's a very rapey energy.
1805000	1806000	I mean, it's energy.
1806000	1809000	You know, he's really advancing himself on the woman.
1810000	1816000	And it would be less of a crime if it was beloved.
1816000	1818000	I've never met a Pimplepew fan.
1818000	1819000	Really?
1819000	1820000	Yeah.
1820000	1822000	I've seen a lot of merchandise for the girl.
1822000	1824000	Like, that will be on girly stuff.
1824000	1825000	Really?
1825000	1826000	The traumatized girl?
1826000	1828000	Like pajamas and things like that.
1828000	1830000	Because sometimes, I think there was an episode
1830000	1832000	where she does, like, fall in love with him.
1832000	1833000	You're right.
1833000	1835000	She flips it on him.
1835000	1836000	Why does that happen?
1836000	1838000	Did she get knocked on the head or something?
1838000	1841000	Yeah, and then he's like, oh, be careful what you wish for.
1841000	1842000	And then he hates it.
1842000	1844000	He's like, oh, for some reason.
1844000	1846000	I don't like it when they want it.
1846000	1847000	Yes.
1847000	1848000	See you next week.
1848000	1849000	Yes.
1849000	1855000	I am what they call the top.
1855000	1857000	It was the only Looney tune in history
1857000	1859000	where Porky Pig came out at the end and said,
1859000	1861000	I'll be out of the think about it.
1865000	1867000	He was very lucid.
1868000	1870000	He didn't get very tongue-tied.
1870000	1872000	Talk to your children about this.
1872000	1875000	That's not all, folks.
1875000	1877000	Look into it.
1877000	1878000	It's weird.
1878000	1880000	Like, none of that would fly today,
1880000	1882000	but they're all based on, like, sort of stereotypes
1882000	1885000	and, like, kind of adult themes and things like that.
1885000	1886000	Yeah.
1886000	1887000	I mean, someone's stuttering.
1887000	1889000	Like, we'd be like, oh, don't want to...
1889000	1890000	Yeah, well, that's true.
1890000	1891000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1891000	1893000	Like, any kind of recognizable affectation.
1893000	1895000	You're in a minefield now.
1895000	1896000	But that's good.
1896000	1897000	I think that's...
1897000	1898000	I can't even blanch at that, but now I'm like,
1898000	1900000	okay, my challenge is to, like, somehow figure out...
1900000	1902000	I have to have conversations in the writers' room
1902000	1904000	that aren't like, oh, it's like,
1904000	1906000	one of those guys that talks like this.
1906000	1908000	It's like, that's not a character.
1908000	1909000	Right.
1909000	1911000	It's like, okay, you have to talk about it.
1911000	1913000	Well, does he hate himself or does he love himself?
1913000	1915000	And does he, you know, like...
1915000	1918000	I never pitched that character that I just did.
1918000	1919000	But...
1919000	1920000	All right.
1920000	1923000	Well, before you go,
1923000	1925000	John Crickfelucey, you know him, right?
1925000	1926000	Yeah, I used to work for John.
1926000	1927000	Tell him to come on the show.
1927000	1928000	Oh, yeah.
1928000	1929000	I think I did try...
1929000	1931000	Like, I ran into him at a Devo concert recently,
1931000	1933000	but he's all frantic and...
1933000	1934000	That's the coolest sentence ever.
1934000	1935000	Yeah.
1935000	1938000	John Crickfelucey, if you'd like to address the rumor
1938000	1940000	that you're all frantic...
1940000	1942000	It's actually, it's Chris-felucey.
1942000	1943000	Wait, wait.
1943000	1944000	It's Chris-felucey.
1944000	1945000	Wait.
1945000	1946000	No one ever says it, right?
1946000	1948000	I suffer from the same thing.
1948000	1949000	No one can say my name.
1949000	1950000	No, I don't even try your name.
1950000	1951000	I don't even know.
1951000	1952000	Fun techio.
1952000	1953000	I think Jonah Ray once said,
1953000	1955000	Funicelli on the Nerdist.
1955000	1957000	I said it right when I brought you up here.
1957000	1958000	Oh, yeah.
1958000	1959000	You're great, Jess.
1959000	1960000	You got my name.
1960000	1961000	It's Italian.
1961000	1962000	It's all phonetic.
1962000	1965000	He's back five minutes and...
1965000	1968000	But, yeah, I could try to bother him again.
1968000	1969000	Okay.
1969000	1970000	Callie Fonteccio.
1970000	1972000	Callie Fonteccio, everybody.
1981000	1982000	They were blindsided by that.
1982000	1984000	They were like, who's this lady?
1984000	1985000	Some of them were like, that's my friend.
1985000	1987000	I have one of her pieces of art.
1987000	1988000	She drew a Roy Orbison.
1988000	1991000	I have it hanging in my bathroom.
1991000	1995000	Every time I pee, I think of you and Roy Orbison.
1995000	1996000	Thank you.
1996000	1997000	Isn't that nice?
1997000	2000000	She's a very, very, very gifted illustrator.
2000000	2003000	And I know I seem aloof while I'm saying that,
2003000	2004000	because I'm checking my...
2004000	2006000	Check her out, Callie Kazoo, right?
2006000	2007000	Yeah.
2007000	2008000	On what?
2008000	2009000	Everything?
2009000	2010000	Everything.
2010000	2011000	Callie Kazoo.
2011000	2012000	All right.
2012000	2013000	Wait, was there any danger with this guy?
2013000	2014000	What happened?
2014000	2015000	Was there any...?
2015000	2016000	No, he said...
2016000	2019000	I nailed it with all of my projected speculation.
2019000	2020000	It was crazy guy.
2020000	2021000	I said French crazy guy.
2021000	2022000	Pepe Le Pew, Callie Kazoo.
2022000	2023000	Then, okay.
2025000	2027000	And Tigger, too.
2028000	2030000	There was a guy, Erin, was texting me.
2030000	2032000	She was like, there's this guy.
2032000	2035000	All these delivery guys would come over.
2035000	2038000	Someone would be delivering something like a wedding gift.
2038000	2041000	And invariably, they started...
2041000	2043000	Like, there's a crazy guy out there.
2043000	2045000	Like, he told me he wanted to eat my face.
2045000	2046000	He told me...
2046000	2047000	He actually...
2047000	2048000	He said...
2048000	2051000	He said to the yummy.com guy...
2053000	2054000	Which...
2054000	2055000	Wait, so what?
2055000	2057000	Erin got busted ordering from yummy.com that day.
2057000	2058000	I want to know more about yummy.com.
2058000	2059000	I know.
2059000	2061000	Erin's not here, but she'll tell you all about it.
2061000	2063000	She's a stockholder now.
2064000	2068000	But the yummy.com guy said that he...
2068000	2072000	This guy outside our gate told the yummy.com guy
2072000	2074000	that he had a disgusting face.
2075000	2077000	And then he wanted to hurt him.
2077000	2082000	And then, Demorge, a harmontown friend,
2082000	2083000	Demorge came by.
2083000	2084000	Erin was...
2084000	2086000	There was a birthday party for Dustin's girlfriend, Elizabeth.
2086000	2088000	And Demorge walked by the guy.
2088000	2089000	He's still out there.
2089000	2091000	He just, like, runs these long shifts.
2091000	2092000	And he said...
2092000	2096000	He said something so awkwardly racist that it was almost not racist.
2096000	2099000	But it was, like, an earnest attempt to be racist.
2099000	2101000	He called him something, like...
2101000	2102000	It was, like...
2102000	2104000	It was really weird.
2104000	2105000	Like...
2105000	2108000	Everybody that he walks by, he says something to that makes them stop and go,
2108000	2109000	What?
2109000	2112000	And then he repeats whatever he said, and then everyone goes,
2112000	2113000	Oh...
2114000	2115000	And then walks away.
2115000	2116000	He's not physically hurting anybody.
2116000	2117000	But I made the...
2117000	2120000	Is he only in front of your gate, or is he kind of moving itinerantly around?
2120000	2122000	He's popping around that location.
2122000	2124000	And I was, like, asking Erin, like,
2124000	2125000	How's he dressed?
2125000	2126000	What does he look like?
2126000	2127000	And I drew the conclusion.
2127000	2130000	I was, like, that guy is, like, a relative of one of our neighbors.
2130000	2132000	He hasn't been around in a while.
2132000	2134000	He has half a support system.
2134000	2136000	Somebody is letting him out.
2136000	2137000	And he's, like...
2137000	2140000	He's, like, haunting these spots, and he's a little confused,
2140000	2144000	and maybe, you know, on the wrong meds, or off the half of them,
2144000	2146000	or having to drink with them, or something's happening,
2146000	2147000	and he's kind of, like...
2147000	2148000	He's gravitating this spot.
2148000	2151000	I was fucking dead on, because there was a guy, a party guest came by,
2151000	2152000	and I was, like, knew who the guy was,
2152000	2154000	knew who he was related to in the neighborhood,
2154000	2156000	and said, I'm gonna call his mom, and she doesn't know,
2156000	2157000	and he's at all this stuff.
2157000	2159000	I fucking nailed it.
2159000	2161000	I'm, like, Dr. Quinn.
2162000	2164000	Medicine woman.
2167000	2169000	She's more intuitive than a regular doctor.
2179000	2181000	Dan, doing a camera take doesn't save that bit.
2185000	2187000	You can't just appeal to fake people up.
2189000	2190000	All right. All right.
2190000	2191000	So, no more...
2191000	2195000	I got no more Evernotes, but the show's only just begun.
2195000	2198000	I have a special friend here.
2198000	2202000	He's come to L.A., and he's bopping around, doing special projects,
2202000	2206000	and I saw on Twitter that he was in L.A.,
2206000	2208000	and I've been tweeting back and forth for a long time.
2208000	2213000	He made one of the best shows in the U.K. and the world.
2213000	2215000	He's no fluke.
2215000	2220000	He's a repeated British TV showrunner with multiple successes,
2220000	2222000	one of which you're a huge fan of.
2222000	2225000	If you're willing to come up here and have a little chit-chat,
2225000	2229000	please come up, creator of Father Ted and the IT crowd, Graham Linahan.
2236000	2248000	Thanks very much.
2248000	2252000	I think that the IT crowd transcends even the Anglophile factor.
2252000	2256000	I would assume everybody in this audience probably is the first
2256000	2259000	to love British shit more than American shit.
2259000	2262000	I'm just trying to copy American shit.
2262000	2267000	I want to talk about that in one second,
2267000	2272000	but the IT crowd stands out as this real export,
2272000	2278000	which probably explains the continued attempts to Americanize it,
2278000	2281000	which I also want to talk in depth about.
2281000	2284000	I'm trying to help one of those attempts.
2284000	2287000	The first attempt was a little bit of a false start.
2287000	2288000	They boxed you out.
2288000	2290000	I found out about it on the Internet.
2291000	2295000	One day I saw, oh, the pilot of the IT crowd starts filming
2295000	2302000	in a week or something, and yeah, they just didn't tell me about it.
2302000	2306000	They didn't get a single phone call or anything.
2306000	2309000	In fact, I think you know the people who did it.
2309000	2310000	Sony?
2310000	2311000	No.
2311000	2314000	I think they wrote briefly on a little show called Community.
2315000	2317000	But what are you talking about?
2317000	2319000	I know you're working with some of them now.
2319000	2320000	No, no, no.
2320000	2322000	That's a totally different group.
2322000	2325000	The first time was these guys who took over
2325000	2326000	when you stopped doing it for a while.
2326000	2328000	Oh, was that Porte and Gracio?
2328000	2329000	Yeah.
2329000	2331000	They tried to do the first...
2331000	2333000	I didn't make that connection.
2333000	2334000	I didn't know that.
2334000	2335000	Yeah.
2335000	2337000	I try not to think about the whole thing,
2337000	2340000	so I hope I'm not incredibly wrong here,
2340000	2342000	but yeah, I think it's the same guys.
2342000	2343000	Might as well be.
2343000	2344000	Wait.
2344000	2345000	Gracio did what?
2345000	2346000	They did the...
2346000	2347000	Gracio did what?
2347000	2349000	I think, if I'd known we were going to talk about this,
2349000	2352000	I would have re-looked it up again,
2352000	2356000	but they did the original version of the IT crowd with Joel,
2356000	2362000	which is online, and you can watch if you are hating yourself particularly.
2362000	2371000	There's a crazy weird Velcro level coincidence factor
2372000	2374000	in the relationship between IT crowd and community.
2374000	2376000	I don't know how much of it is causal
2376000	2378000	and how much of it is completely independent of each other.
2378000	2382000	Joel McHale was on that attempt to do the IT crowd.
2382000	2384000	If you're correct, Porte and Gracio,
2384000	2388000	who would later supplant me, were running it,
2388000	2391000	Richard Iowani ended up directing a community episode.
2391000	2394000	That's less coincidence than we're just being a fan of the IT crowd,
2394000	2398000	but before Joel McHale was cast or even considered
2398000	2401000	for the part of Jeff Winger on Community,
2401000	2405000	guess who I had dinner with because people were jazzed about him
2405000	2408000	and they really wanted to be this hot actor.
2408000	2411000	Chris O'Dowd was going to be Jeff Winger possibly.
2411000	2413000	I did a little dinner with him.
2413000	2415000	Joel McHale wasn't even on the table yet.
2415000	2416000	That's so weird.
2416000	2418000	That's incredible.
2418000	2420000	That's the one that really weirds me out.
2420000	2424000	Well, it might be because we're interested in similar things and themes.
2424000	2427000	I always thought community was the closest thing to an IT crowd,
2427000	2432000	because I don't think you can do my kind of comedy
2432000	2435000	in front of a studio audience over here quite as easily.
2435000	2439000	I mean, the one we're doing here is going to be in front of a studio audience,
2439000	2444000	but I want to try and help make it kind of work more as a US sitcom.
2444000	2446000	It's going to be multi-cam this year.
2446000	2447000	Yeah, I think so.
2447000	2448000	I think that's appropriate.
2448000	2451000	The multi-cam is not, by definition, stupid,
2451000	2456000	and one need only watch a British show or an old American show
2456000	2457000	or Steinfeld.
2457000	2459000	I mean, Steinfeld's not that old.
2459000	2462000	It's like, you know, that's the last big sitcom, isn't it?
2462000	2464000	That kind of, isn't it?
2464000	2465000	Yeah, friends.
2465000	2469000	Yeah, but Steinfeld, did Steinfeld run after it?
2469000	2470000	I can't remember.
2470000	2472000	But anyway, you know, these aren't that old.
2472000	2475000	And also, you know, things like faulty towers.
2475000	2478000	I just hate the idea of chucking all these things in the bin
2478000	2481000	because they're supposedly out of date, you know?
2481000	2485000	Well, it's because they satisfied people so much, that form,
2485000	2487000	and it became automatable.
2487000	2490000	And so the craft got a little corrupted by the money.
2490000	2494000	And so it's the practices that are associated with the format.
2494000	2498000	It's not like people can look at the shows that break big
2498000	2500000	because they really become culturally effective
2500000	2502000	and make people really happy.
2502000	2503000	They're multi-cam shows.
2503000	2504000	Yeah, it seems to be.
2504000	2506000	And unless you start counting Mash or, you know,
2506000	2509000	let's say Beverly Hillbillies.
2509000	2511000	You know, single cam doesn't like,
2511000	2515000	it doesn't have that same chance of really becoming
2515000	2518000	a culturally effective cornerstone.
2518000	2521000	I do think it's a little bit of magic dust sometimes
2521000	2523000	when you hear an audience laughing.
2523000	2527000	But the important thing is when you hear a real audience laughing
2527000	2529000	and when you hear them really laughing.
2529000	2533000	And I think that you have to just like, you bring them into a studio.
2533000	2537000	I almost think, I'll ask you if it's true, I think in the U.K.
2537000	2542000	because it's less, there's a lot less like super capitalistic
2542000	2544000	like engine running the whole thing.
2544000	2549000	The little less like fever pitch like juice that baby up a little bit.
2549000	2550000	Who's that guy in the front?
2550000	2552000	Hey, you know who we're bringing in?
2552000	2553000	The hammer laugher.
2553000	2555000	His name's Todd Hammer.
2555000	2557000	He laughs at $75 an hour.
2557000	2559000	He's a great laugher.
2559000	2562000	I think you might have a bit more technology as well around it.
2562000	2565000	I mean, really, the only manipulation I do
2565000	2567000	is when I overrule the audience.
2567000	2571000	Because they often laugh at things that either weren't meant to be funny
2571000	2576000	or that aren't really funny and I just kind of go, no, you're overruled.
2576000	2578000	Because the thing that really makes people think it's fake
2578000	2581000	is when someone laughs at something that's not funny.
2581000	2584000	Was Father Ted multicam or was it all single?
2584000	2585000	Yeah, multicam.
2585000	2587000	But you did exterior stuff too.
2587000	2590000	Yeah, and we played the audience on monitors.
2590000	2593000	I mean, you know, I'm very, especially since the internet,
2593000	2595000	especially since I can actually talk to people,
2595000	2600000	I'm really, really serious about making sure that every laugh is, you know, real.
2600000	2603000	And often if you're, you know, what people don't realize
2603000	2605000	is you're often going between three or four takes.
2605000	2607000	And so the audience laughed.
2607000	2610000	And then if we weren't to do anything to the laughter,
2610000	2613000	the audience would just go, and then it would just cut off.
2613000	2615000	And then there would be a kind of little giggle.
2615000	2618000	And you just kind of make it, the audience is like an actor.
2618000	2621000	You're pretending, the audience suddenly has to,
2621000	2624000	you have to suddenly pretend that they're an audience
2624000	2626000	watching a whole performance all the way through.
2626000	2629000	I think it's a great energy to multicam stuff, like for the actors,
2629000	2630000	because it's like putting on a play.
2630000	2631000	You rehearse all week.
2631000	2633000	And there's laughs that get laughs all week.
2633000	2635000	And some that go away and some that change.
2635000	2639000	And sometimes on the night, the laugh that you was in the bank the whole time
2639000	2640000	just doesn't work in front of the audience.
2640000	2641000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2641000	2644000	And so there's an energy to the cast where you're always alive
2644000	2646000	and the writers are there pitching lines.
2646000	2649000	And there is a kind of an energy to a multicam.
2649000	2650000	I love it.
2650000	2653000	I love when something doesn't get a laugh and running out
2653000	2657000	and having a quick kind of intense conflab to try and come up with a better line.
2657000	2658000	And sometimes it can be a pitch of a new line
2658000	2660000	or just an adjustment of the performance of it.
2660000	2661000	Yeah.
2661000	2662000	And that's magical sometimes.
2662000	2663000	Yeah, yeah, it really is.
2663000	2667000	And it's why I like to do it.
2667000	2670000	I've done a show recently, though, called The Walsh's,
2670000	2672000	which is a single camera.
2672000	2675000	And they're naturalistic actors.
2675000	2678000	It requires the camera to be up close,
2678000	2681000	picking up the tiny little flickers.
2681000	2683000	An audience would only get in the way of that.
2683000	2689000	But there are some performers who are kind of lifted on gales of laughter.
2689000	2691000	A guy who worked with Steve Delaney,
2691000	2695000	who does a character called Count Arthur that I'm writing at the moment,
2695000	2698000	John Cleese in Faulty Towers.
2698000	2705000	He can't imagine some of these shows like Kramer, Michael Richards in Seinfeld.
2705000	2709000	Without laughter, he would just be a kind of weird.
2709000	2712000	But also, it's also holding for real laughter.
2712000	2714000	When you come in and something magical happens,
2714000	2715000	and there's a laughter,
2715000	2717000	there's a laughter, you actually hit like a Carol Burnett show,
2717000	2719000	where they would hold for these giant laughs.
2719000	2720000	Oh, yeah, that's great, too.
2720000	2723000	And then like you as a viewer watching through your TV,
2723000	2727000	I was a kid watching like Carol Burnett and my carpet in front of my big Zenith TV.
2727000	2729000	It's like you felt like you were part of that audience.
2729000	2731000	You were part of the tribe when you were watching that.
2731000	2733000	I just don't think, I think it's just,
2733000	2738000	at the moment, there don't seem to be many good shows that have an audience.
2738000	2739000	But it'll change.
2739000	2740000	There'll be one big show.
2740000	2741000	It'll be great.
2741000	2742000	Everyone will love it.
2742000	2743000	And suddenly, everyone will be like,
2743000	2745000	why are you doing single camera stuff?
2745000	2746000	It'll be the IT crowd,
2746000	2750000	because I'm sure you're at a great network that respects comedy.
2752000	2753000	Where is it?
2753000	2754000	NBC.
2754000	2755000	All right!
2758000	2760000	This one's going to last forever.
2761000	2765000	I can't have this conversation into a microphone.
2765000	2766000	No, you can't.
2767000	2769000	Don't take him down with you.
2772000	2773000	I mean, I'm still in bed with them.
2773000	2774000	They're still, you know,
2774000	2776000	a community is now owned by three entities now.
2776000	2777000	One of them is NBC.
2777000	2780000	I can't, you know, I can't begrudge them.
2780000	2783000	We've got Chevy Chase doing Douglas, though.
2783000	2784000	Oh, that's good.
2785000	2786000	That's fantastic.
2787000	2792000	You're going to need to go single camera for some elements, then.
2793000	2795000	He is more a machine than man.
2803000	2804000	I wanted to ask you...
2804000	2805000	Is this on camera, actually?
2805000	2806000	Yeah, it is.
2806000	2807000	Do I look okay?
2807000	2808000	Do I look awkward?
2808000	2809000	You look great.
2809000	2810000	No.
2810000	2812000	They call you Irish Dan Harmon.
2812000	2813000	Okay.
2814000	2815000	That's all I ever want.
2817000	2819000	Which they call that an Irish compliment.
2822000	2824000	Are you familiar with the phrase Irish medicine,
2824000	2826000	or is that a horrible American phrase?
2826000	2827000	No, I've never heard of it.
2827000	2828000	Irish medicine.
2828000	2829000	Yeah.
2829000	2831000	That's just medicine that doesn't work.
2833000	2837000	Irish medicine is saying to somebody who thinks they're having a heart attack,
2837000	2839000	but probably isn't, should I call an ambulance?
2840000	2841000	That's great.
2842000	2844000	Irish people would really approve of that.
2844000	2845000	That's great.
2846000	2848000	Yeah, Irish breakfast is a whiskey and a cigarette.
2848000	2849000	What is it?
2851000	2852000	That's a Mexican one.
2852000	2853000	Okay, all right.
2853000	2856000	We had a book of American slang and it was just filled with it.
2856000	2859000	It was just like everything's like a Chinese landing is a crash.
2862000	2867000	You guys are going to be okay if the book was written in 1903
2867000	2869000	and you're going to be fine.
2870000	2872000	That book was flagrant.
2872000	2873000	Really amazing.
2873000	2875000	I mean, it was really amazing the formula that would develop.
2875000	2878000	Like everything that's Chinese was backwards, was an inversion,
2878000	2881000	and everything was Mexican was like slightly less so.
2881000	2882000	Oh, this is a real book?
2882000	2883000	Yeah, yeah.
2883000	2885000	It was just like, oh, you get to the C's and the M's,
2885000	2887000	and it was like, okay.
2887000	2889000	It's a whole book of just racist terms.
2889000	2891000	Yeah, it was called a dictionary of American slang,
2891000	2892000	but it was really just like,
2892000	2896000	it could have easily been called a dictionary of racist modifiers.
2896000	2899000	I saw a book today, I was in Barnes and Noble,
2899000	2902000	and I saw a book today that was called something like,
2902000	2903000	I don't know what it was called.
2903000	2906000	It was called something like, one bit of it was normal,
2906000	2907000	but the other bit was crazy,
2907000	2910000	and the subtitle of it was something like,
2910000	2913000	The Guns of Bad Men.
2913000	2916000	It was a book of guns, and it was just,
2916000	2921000	this is like an encyclopedia of guns of bad men.
2921000	2922000	Guns like bang bang?
2922000	2924000	Yeah, but that's how it was written.
2924000	2925000	The Guns of Bad Men.
2925000	2927000	Like someone thought, what do we call this book?
2927000	2930000	The Guns of Bad Men.
2930000	2932000	It was just like Billy the Kid or whoever.
2932000	2934000	Yeah, yeah, it was only, this is his weapon.
2934000	2935000	He used this kind of thing,
2935000	2937000	but it was just that weird title.
2937000	2940000	Well, maybe that was the end of a long dinner
2940000	2943000	with a frustrated literary agent.
2943000	2945000	It was like, no, God damn it.
2945000	2949000	No, Triggers and Tribulations.
2949000	2951000	And the lit agent was like,
2951000	2955000	do you understand everyone regrets buying this book?
2955000	2957000	We're going to be lucky to sell five copies.
2957000	2959000	I'm going to title it for you, all right?
2959000	2961000	Just like, oh, yeah, you wish you could.
2961000	2963000	Yeah, fucking.
2963000	2965000	The one guy at the back who never gets to talk.
2965000	2968000	Guns of Bad Men.
2968000	2970000	I wanted to ask you, you brought up John Cleese,
2970000	2973000	who is credited with a thing that exists in the UK
2973000	2977000	that doesn't exist in American TV culture.
2977000	2981000	I heard this from, I think, Edgar Wright.
2981000	2983000	There's a phrase for it,
2983000	2985000	something to do with Four Seasons and Out.
2985000	2987000	Like, do you know what I'm talking about?
2987000	2990000	Faulty Towers was four, you guys call them series.
2990000	2991000	Two series.
2991000	2992000	Oh, two.
2992000	2993000	Yeah, only 12 episodes.
2993000	2995000	I'm already wrong and I'm ready to start it.
2995000	2997000	But it was like, there's a set amount of episodes
2997000	3001000	that a British TV writer looks at as being dignified.
3001000	3004000	And beyond that, you're just like, what am I, American?
3004000	3006000	I love that.
3006000	3008000	I love that Simpsons joke where it goes,
3008000	3010000	Britain's longest-running sitcom.
3010000	3014000	See y'all eight episodes next week.
3015000	3019000	But it's because it's not really a team-riding culture.
3019000	3022000	And so you can get burnt out.
3022000	3025000	I was quite proud of getting as many series of I.T. crowd
3025000	3028000	as I did because it was, when you write on your own,
3028000	3031000	I realized too late, this is fun.
3031000	3034000	I'm not enjoying this.
3034000	3037000	And you get worse and worse every year, not you, me.
3037000	3041000	The royal you.
3042000	3046000	I feel like I'm dragging my brain along concrete
3046000	3049000	and it's like this dog that won't heal.
3049000	3054000	And in order to be as good as a season five episode story,
3054000	3056000	I just have to hurt myself.
3056000	3058000	And it's kind of sad.
3058000	3059000	Yeah, yeah.
3059000	3061000	But do you feel that even with a team?
3061000	3062000	I mean, isn't it easier?
3062000	3066000	The team can only, I mean, the team
3066000	3070000	has this tremendous amount of power.
3070000	3075000	If I ask them for 50 names for a new disease,
3075000	3080000	if I can quantify it, if I can give them instructions,
3080000	3086000	they are so much more talented than I could ever be about jokes.
3086000	3092000	But I'm a victim of my own Christ mythology.
3092000	3097000	I've been fired and rehired and these kids
3097000	3099000	that are the only people that would work for me,
3099000	3102000	they're so talented and so reverent.
3102000	3108000	I can't just say, you guys write a story.
3108000	3111000	It's just coming to wait for me to get tired of Minecraft
3111000	3115000	and then like, OK, now he's going, he's going, he's going.
3115000	3116000	I don't know.
3116000	3118000	I'm not a good leader.
3118000	3120000	I don't know how to run a room.
3120000	3121000	He said it, he said it, he said it.
3121000	3125000	Fire him, fire him.
3125000	3128000	The last time I said that, yeah.
3128000	3131000	But still, it must be better, though, than the whole thing.
3131000	3134000	The conversation with me goes, is this funny?
3134000	3137000	And then I say, I don't know.
3137000	3139000	That's what I do all day.
3139000	3142000	Yeah, I defer constant.
3142000	3146000	I love, like, my favorite thing is if I can write a story,
3146000	3149000	if I can come up with something and then I can actually
3149000	3152000	go through the script and then I finally learned this
3152000	3156000	after like four years of doing a TV show, like how to,
3156000	3158000	you're supposed to just do this.
3158000	3162000	Write a shitty script but have it make some semblance of sense
3162000	3166000	and then go through and then you put like,
3166000	3167000	I put three question marks.
3167000	3168000	I don't know who taught me that.
3168000	3170000	I don't know if that comes from one show or another
3170000	3171000	or if that's a standard thing.
3171000	3175000	But three question marks and then Chang comes in and says,
3175000	3176000	they go, where were you?
3176000	3179000	And he goes, I'm an hour late because, question mark,
3179000	3184000	question mark, question mark, I fought a German shepherd
3184000	3187000	over a butterscotch candy and I lost.
3187000	3189000	And it's not funny and it doesn't matter.
3189000	3192000	And then I just ship it out to a room full of geniuses
3192000	3196000	who work for Colbert and The Onion and Lampoon
3196000	3200000	and everything and they return to me the same script.
3200000	3202000	So it says, Chang injures the room.
3202000	3203000	Where were you?
3203000	3204000	I got fought.
3204000	3206000	And then there's a list separated with slashes
3206000	3209000	and it's just take your pick and it's just embarrassingly long
3209000	3213000	and they love it because in that room there's no wrong answers
3213000	3216000	and they just get to flourish.
3216000	3218000	I'm sure there's all kinds of horrible emotional things
3218000	3222000	that happen to them in there but they don't want me in there.
3222000	3223000	Really? Do you mind?
3223000	3225000	No, because it would be weird actually.
3225000	3227000	I used to joke about, I never go in there
3227000	3228000	but they're like, we don't want you in there.
3228000	3229000	Really?
3229000	3230000	Yeah, we don't.
3230000	3231000	Oh, I hate that.
3231000	3232000	I'd like to be in there.
3232000	3234000	I'd like to just, you know, I don't know.
3234000	3236000	To help or to judge?
3236000	3237000	No, no, to help.
3237000	3240000	To kind of, to help people make me laugh.
3240000	3244000	I've been sitting and smelling my own farts all day.
3244000	3246000	Yeah, well, yeah.
3246000	3249000	Twitter's been interesting on some of that
3249000	3251000	because sometimes people suggest things
3251000	3256000	and, you know, you rarely get something good
3256000	3258000	but God, someone said something brilliant
3258000	3262000	and they said, it's really funny, they just said,
3262000	3265000	I was on the toilet today and I couldn't get up
3265000	3267000	because the cat fell asleep in my trousers.
3268000	3270000	You can have that one for free.
3271000	3273000	I was like, I will indeed have that one.
3273000	3275000	That is a good little slice of life.
3275000	3276000	Holy shit!
3276000	3278000	What a great reason for someone to be late.
3279000	3283000	All I added was, I didn't have the heart to move him.
3285000	3287000	That's a great little specific,
3287000	3289000	that's what good comedy writing is,
3289000	3291000	it's like a little specific textural.
3291000	3294000	Oh shit, and another thing happened on the last series.
3294000	3298000	There was a competition that was done for some charity
3298000	3300000	so I couldn't say no, I didn't want to say no,
3300000	3305000	but they said, the thing that was auctioned
3305000	3312000	was a chance to get your name in one episode of my new show, you know.
3312000	3314000	So I said, okay, thinking,
3314000	3317000	the name would be Roger Smith or whatever, you know.
3317000	3321000	And the name came back and it was Rocky Fuglar Hegarty.
3322000	3324000	Which is a bonus.
3324000	3326000	That is a Monty Python name.
3326000	3328000	Yeah, but it was kind of a bonus,
3328000	3331000	but the show I'm doing at the moment is sort of set in the real world,
3331000	3334000	so I was trying to figure out a way.
3334000	3338000	And we just kept, and finally I got in touch with them and I said,
3338000	3340000	are you, because I was finding it so hard to place it,
3340000	3343000	and I was like, are you serious, it's not really a name,
3343000	3344000	it's not a real name, you know.
3344000	3347000	That was the competition, don't give me any fake made up names.
3347000	3349000	And I said, no, no, that's our dog.
3349000	3353000	Our dog is Rocky and our family name is Fuglar Hegarty.
3353000	3357000	Oh, sorry, I thought that was funnier than anything.
3357000	3359000	But it was kind of annoying.
3359000	3361000	But Fuglar Hegarty is funny in its own right.
3361000	3362000	I guess, yeah.
3362000	3365000	If the name was Tim Fuglar Hegarty, it's still funny.
3365000	3366000	It would still be bad.
3366000	3370000	So in the end, a guy has to kind of make up a fake name
3370000	3372000	so it worked that he was...
3372000	3374000	I hate making up names.
3374000	3375000	Me too.
3375000	3378000	My scripts are filled with, like the casting director goes nuts
3378000	3381000	and she goes, do you understand these are human beings?
3381000	3386000	I can't offer the part of suit guy to Jeff Goldblum.
3386000	3389000	A sweater person and an other guy.
3389000	3392000	Do you know who's amazing at that is Arthur Matthews,
3392000	3395000	who co-wrote Father Ted with me.
3395000	3397000	He's the one who came up with names like, you know,
3397000	3399000	Father Knoll early.
3399000	3403000	And on toast, the new series is doing it, Matt Berry.
3403000	3405000	Clem Fandango.
3405000	3407000	Clem Fandango.
3407000	3409000	You're called Clem Fandango.
3409000	3411000	Ray Purchas.
3411000	3412000	Ray Purchas.
3412000	3413000	Ray Purchas.
3413000	3415000	Ray Purchas is just...
3415000	3416000	I can't see Arthur.
3416000	3417000	If you've not...
3417000	3419000	I mean, probably a lot of you have seen a test of London,
3419000	3421000	but if you've not seen Father Ted, please go rent that,
3421000	3422000	because it is delightful.
3422000	3423000	It's so funny.
3423000	3424000	Thank you.
3424000	3425000	Thank you.
3425000	3428000	So you guys got...
3428000	3431000	IT crowd got a fifth season, like commissioned.
3431000	3433000	Like they said, give us a fifth series.
3433000	3434000	Yeah.
3434000	3436000	Well, they wouldn't have turned it down.
3436000	3437000	And you just like...
3437000	3438000	Oh, no.
3438000	3439000	No, I know what happened.
3439000	3441000	I tried to write a fifth season,
3441000	3443000	and I just got really tired.
3443000	3445000	And I thought, no, this is done.
3445000	3449000	But I had enough ideas left to make this special.
3449000	3450000	So...
3450000	3453000	Because I really wanted to do Douglas doing Secret Millionaire.
3453000	3457000	And I had one or two other ideas that I thought were funny.
3457000	3460000	And so I just really tried to squeeze them all together.
3460000	3461000	And that's...
3461000	3462000	Did you...
3462000	3464000	And then when you moved on to something else,
3464000	3466000	did you find it rejuvenating energy?
3466000	3467000	Yeah.
3467000	3468000	Absolutely.
3468000	3471000	I'll write Community Forever.
3471000	3478000	But it's just like, man, it is like flint against steel.
3478000	3479000	But it's like a...
3479000	3480000	It's Minecraft.
3480000	3482000	It's just a machine over here.
3482000	3484000	You know, just the desire for more.
3484000	3487000	I mean, The Simpsons blows me away.
3487000	3489000	All due respect to the...
3489000	3491000	I hear it's gotten really good again.
3491000	3494000	Or like one season ago, it was really good.
3494000	3498000	But, you know, it's just crazy how long it goes on.
3498000	3499000	And South Park, too.
3499000	3500000	It's endless.
3500000	3507000	I can't imagine how The Simpsons is able to...
3507000	3510000	I just don't understand how they can sit there and go,
3510000	3511000	what if Bart...
3511000	3512000	What?
3512000	3515000	What if Bart what?
3515000	3516000	Wasn't there a thing...
3516000	3518000	I don't know if it was Sam Simon telling me this,
3518000	3519000	or somebody...
3519000	3521000	They do a thing where they would have two...
3521000	3524000	They would write two different bowls of paper.
3524000	3527000	There was a line of A stories and B stories.
3527000	3530000	A garage sale, and then someone goes to the moon.
3530000	3532000	And then they just pick two at random.
3532000	3533000	I don't know if that's true.
3533000	3534000	That was great.
3534000	3536000	Do you know what I used to love about The Simpsons?
3536000	3538000	The way you can look at an episode of The Simpsons,
3538000	3541000	like in the golden age.
3541000	3544000	And the opening 60 seconds will happen,
3544000	3546000	and you'll have no idea what the rest of the episode is.
3546000	3547000	Yeah, yeah.
3547000	3548000	That was delightful.
3548000	3549000	Yeah, I was very inspired by that.
3549000	3551000	I don't do that on Community or anything,
3551000	3554000	but I think that's so fucking cool.
3554000	3556000	Because you cannot...
3556000	3559000	You're like, oh, this episode begins with like...
3559000	3561000	Hey, Mars, where's a little watermelon?
3561000	3562000	Let's go.
3562000	3563000	We got to go get more watermelon.
3563000	3565000	And then seven minutes into it, you're like,
3565000	3567000	oh, this is the outer space way.
3567000	3568000	Yeah, yeah.
3568000	3569000	It's incredible.
3569000	3570000	It's so weird.
3570000	3572000	But the thing about it is,
3572000	3575000	I think the biggest problem with it
3575000	3578000	is because they're the same age,
3578000	3579000	there's only so many times
3579000	3581000	they can do certain emotional storylines.
3581000	3582000	Yeah.
3582000	3585000	Like, I used to love when The Simpsons got sad.
3585000	3588000	Like, you remember when Homer met his mother
3588000	3593000	and this shot of him just watching the highway?
3593000	3597000	My favorite is when Dustin Hoffman is the substitute teacher.
3597000	3598000	Oh!
3598000	3599000	You are Lisa Simpson.
3599000	3601000	Did somebody tell me there was a change on that?
3601000	3602000	The description said...
3602000	3604000	I spoke to him on Twitter about that.
3604000	3607000	He said he still loses sleep
3607000	3608000	because the line,
3608000	3609000	you are Lisa Simpson,
3609000	3611000	didn't have an exclamation mark on it.
3611000	3612000	But it's better without it.
3612000	3613000	It's better without it.
3613000	3614000	He's crazy.
3614000	3615000	I cry every time I say it.
3615000	3616000	The first time, I'll still cry right now
3616000	3617000	thinking about it for the best.
3617000	3618000	Yeah, no.
3618000	3619000	And the exclamation point,
3619000	3621000	for me, it would have softened it a bit.
3621000	3623000	I might have given her a fright.
3623000	3626000	Why are you yelling at me?
3626000	3628000	Spencer, I didn't see Spencer when I came in.
3628000	3629000	I don't know.
3629000	3630000	Do we have a Spencer?
3630000	3631000	He's taking the week off.
3631000	3632000	I think he's not coming.
3632000	3633000	Yeah, he's not coming.
3633000	3634000	What did you do?
3634000	3636000	This show is even better organized
3636000	3637000	than it appears to be.
3637000	3639000	I'm not listening at home.
3639000	3642000	I was impressed that he actually exercised the...
3642000	3643000	and said, like,
3643000	3644000	yeah, I'm going to think I'm going to take the week off.
3644000	3645000	And then I said,
3645000	3648000	you know, Jeff's coming back
3648000	3650000	and Graham Linant's coming in.
3650000	3651000	His text back was,
3651000	3655000	which I thought meant he might come.
3655000	3658000	But I think maybe he...
3658000	3662000	Yeah, that's a good way to connect that dot.
3663000	3666000	It's good to be back.
3667000	3669000	You missed Adam Goldberg, didn't you?
3669000	3671000	No.
3671000	3672000	Hey, Adam, how you doing, man?
3672000	3673000	Are you here?
3673000	3674000	Yeah.
3674000	3675000	Good to see you, brother.
3675000	3676000	I haven't taken you in a long time.
3676000	3678000	So you're working with my old friends,
3678000	3680000	Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan,
3680000	3682000	who started Community with me.
3682000	3683000	They were...
3683000	3685000	If there's a community biopic,
3685000	3686000	whatever that would be,
3686000	3689000	like the story of the behind-the-scenes of community,
3689000	3691000	there's no way you can make me the protagonist
3691000	3693000	because I'm a psychopath.
3693000	3695000	Who would you cast as you in that biopic, Dan?
3695000	3697000	It's Robert Johnny Jr.
3700000	3702000	It's embarrassing that you had to ask the...
3702000	3705000	The lack of hesitation to what's embarrassing about it.
3708000	3711000	It's that kind of gallant wit
3711000	3714000	that only RDJ could capture.
3716000	3718000	The protagonist of the movie
3718000	3719000	about the making of Community
3719000	3720000	would have to be Neil Goldman
3720000	3723000	because he's got...
3723000	3725000	He got assigned, essentially,
3725000	3726000	to...
3726000	3728000	He had an overall deal with this company
3728000	3731000	and they got assigned to kind of wrangle this show
3731000	3733000	by this guy who had never run a show.
3733000	3735000	I always wonder about the world
3735000	3737000	from his perspective back then.
3737000	3740000	Hey, Neil, do you ever want to come up
3740000	3742000	and talk about anything?
3742000	3743000	No, you're not.
3745000	3746000	That's why he's...
3746000	3748000	I mean, I call him the schmoo back then
3748000	3751000	because he's politically facile.
3751000	3752000	He knows...
3752000	3754000	He's got a bigger house
3754000	3756000	and he's gonna work longer and has worked longer
3756000	3758000	because he knows how to...
3758000	3762000	He doesn't have the ego and the...
3762000	3764000	What do you call it? The backbone.
3766000	3767000	Wow.
3770000	3773000	Graham, who plays you in the biopic about you?
3773000	3775000	I'm shit now. I don't have a fast answer.
3775000	3776000	Damn it.
3776000	3778000	I'm gonna go Liam Neeson now.
3779000	3781000	What is it about Liam Neeson?
3781000	3782000	I don't know.
3782000	3783000	He's Irish.
3783000	3785000	I like the way Liam Neeson suddenly is the guy
3785000	3787000	you call to kick ass now.
3787000	3788000	It's amazing.
3788000	3789000	They got my number.
3789000	3790000	I'll watch it any time.
3790000	3792000	Liam Neeson fighting a pumpkin?
3792000	3793000	I don't care.
3796000	3797000	Dan, how would that go?
3799000	3800000	Hang on, hang on.
3800000	3804000	Let me see if I can find a sound cue for that.
3804000	3805000	I think it might have it.
3806000	3807000	What the fuck is...
3808000	3809000	Is this the trailer?
3809000	3811000	This is the voiceover from the trailer
3811000	3813000	for the Liam Neeson versus a pumpkin movie.
3814000	3815000	Okay, I don't have the music.
3815000	3816000	You should go.
3818000	3820000	I want you to understand something.
3823000	3826000	Pumpkin's just lying on the floor by the phone.
3831000	3833000	I'm trained to handle things like you.
3835000	3836000	You're orange.
3838000	3839000	You're round.
3841000	3842000	I don't give a fuck.
3845000	3847000	I have a certain set of skills.
3847000	3850000	Now I'm just doing like the Weird Al Yankovic version.
3850000	3851000	I can stomp things.
3852000	3855000	It would be more interesting if Liam Neeson was
3855000	3857000	warning you about pumpkins surrounding your camp.
3858000	3859000	They don't care.
3859000	3861000	Have you seen the Jurassic Park trailer?
3862000	3864000	I saw like a little...
3864000	3865000	Were people cheering for it?
3866000	3867000	The park is open.
3868000	3869000	Doesn't it look bad?
3869000	3870000	There's a new Jurassic Park?
3870000	3871000	Yeah, yeah.
3871000	3873000	But there's a line in it.
3873000	3876000	There's a line in it that's the worst trailer line
3876000	3877000	I've ever heard.
3877000	3878000	It's unbelievable.
3878000	3879000	No, no, that's not it.
3881000	3884000	Apparently they've created a new super dinosaur, right?
3884000	3885000	Right, yeah.
3885000	3886000	And that's established.
3886000	3888000	And then later on halfway through...
3888000	3889000	See right there, that's a good movie.
3889000	3890000	That's a good movie so far.
3890000	3891000	Yeah, so far.
3891000	3892000	So far.
3892000	3893000	But this is the trailer bit.
3893000	3896000	And if this is in the trailer, can you imagine what the film is like?
3897000	3898000	But he says...
3900000	3901000	He says, that depends.
3902000	3903000	And someone says, that depends on what?
3904000	3907000	And he goes, that depends on what kind of super dinosaur
3907000	3908000	they've created in that lab.
3911000	3912000	That's not it exactly.
3912000	3914000	But that's more or less it, isn't it?
3915000	3916000	What the hell is that?
3917000	3918000	That's not a cool line.
3918000	3920000	That's not Yippee Ki-Yay, motherfucker.
3921000	3922000	That's shit.
3922000	3926000	That's like in the 50s when they called spaceships and ray guns and robots.
3926000	3929000	That's like if you were asked your 90-year-old father
3929000	3931000	to tell you what the film was about.
3931000	3934000	Apparently there's a huge dinosaur in a lab.
3935000	3937000	And it's the fastest I've seen...
3937000	3940000	I mean, that guy from Guardians of the Galaxy.
3940000	3944000	Yeah, it feels like, oh, that feels like a bad decision.
3944000	3946000	To be in that movie, I think he'll be fine.
3946000	3947000	Yeah.
3947000	3948000	He'll be fine.
3948000	3950000	I think the film might be bigger than him and it might.
3950000	3952000	Like, does it bit when he's racing raptors?
3952000	3953000	What's he doing racing raptors?
3953000	3956000	He's going to be the sexy awesome raptor trainer.
3958000	3960000	I learned from Jurassic Park 1 that
3960000	3962000	Velociraptors are cheetah speed.
3963000	3964000	He's going to be...
3964000	3965000	That's the thing.
3965000	3967000	There's a little bit of insidious genius to that.
3967000	3969000	I can't tell if that's the dumbest thing or the smartest thing in the world.
3969000	3973000	That the raptors, which are the, you know, the Ron Silver
3973000	3975000	in Heat Vision terms of the first movie.
3975000	3976000	So, wow.
3976000	3978000	I couldn't think of another analogy.
3979000	3980000	I can't, my brain is dying.
3980000	3982000	The Ed 209.
3982000	3984000	The Ed 209, that's great, thank you.
3984000	3987000	The Ed 209 of the first movie, like, they're, you know,
3987000	3989000	the idet impulse in a sequel to like...
3989000	3990000	Oh, what, they're...
3990000	3991000	They're the good guys.
3991000	3992000	They're the good guys?
3992000	3994000	Because you see a shot of, like, Chris Pratt on a four-wheeler
3994000	3995000	and there's, like, raptors running alongside him.
3995000	3996000	Like, golden retriever.
3996000	3997000	He's like, woohoo!
3997000	3999000	But I was thinking, I was thinking...
3999000	4001000	Is he racing them or are they chasing him?
4001000	4002000	They better be chasing him.
4002000	4005000	I think he's showing up to save the day because here's what I think about Chris Pratt's character.
4005000	4006000	Here's my prediction.
4006000	4008000	Like, there is a cheetah speed guy and now he's the bad guy.
4008000	4011000	There's gotta be a guy that's like, come on, you raptors!
4011000	4012000	Come on, you lot!
4012000	4013000	And...
4013000	4015000	He's gotta be British, you know?
4015000	4017000	And Chris Pratt comes up and goes, like,
4017000	4019000	they don't respond to negative reinforcement.
4023000	4024000	Oh, yeah?
4026000	4029000	Well, you know who else didn't respond to negative reinforcement?
4029000	4030000	Oh, speaking of...
4033000	4034000	King Kong.
4034000	4036000	He was a bigot.
4036000	4040000	And he's just as dead as all these fucking lizards are gonna be.
4044000	4046000	You just gotta disagree with your attitude.
4046000	4050000	And then he's like, well, let's see you get this lot into the cage.
4050000	4053000	And then he's brought his own raptors from, like, site nine or something.
4053000	4055000	And he goes, like, Rutger!
4055000	4056000	Zippo!
4056000	4057000	Woop!
4057000	4058000	Woop!
4059000	4064000	He blows into Sam Neale's esophagus mold.
4064000	4065000	Woop woop!
4065000	4066000	Woop woop!
4066000	4067000	And then the raptor's like...
4068000	4070000	And they do what they're told.
4070000	4071000	But they're kind of like...
4071000	4072000	There's a begrudging respect.
4072000	4073000	He's like...
4073000	4074000	He's like...
4074000	4076000	Oh, did you get them to do what you want like that?
4076000	4077000	And he's like...
4077000	4079000	I didn't get them to do what I want.
4079000	4081000	I let them do what they want.
4088000	4089000	And he's hit that...
4089000	4092000	Chris Pratt has hit that sweet spot where it's like he's...
4092000	4096000	All the women want him to make out with him and all the men don't mind.
4096000	4097000	And that's the key.
4097000	4100000	You don't want to get into that Tom Cruise gutter where it's like...
4100000	4101000	Yeah, all the men are like...
4101000	4102000	All the men are like, yeah, I can...
4102000	4106000	Are there any kind of comic relief moments with Rutger and Zippo?
4107000	4109000	No, that wouldn't be doing it bad.
4109000	4113000	You want the raptors to be badass and you want Chris Pratt to be like the voice of them.
4113000	4115000	You know, it's like, you gotta let them be cool.
4115000	4116000	They're clever girls.
4119000	4120000	I think...
4121000	4122000	But he'll be cool.
4122000	4123000	Because I mean...
4123000	4127000	In American movies, going from TV to movies, there's some rule.
4127000	4129000	It's like you get two movies.
4129000	4131000	You could do a shitty movie and then a good one.
4131000	4133000	There's like math you can break down.
4133000	4134000	Like Seinfeld couldn't survive it.
4134000	4136000	Like the math is unforgivable.
4136000	4138000	Like going from TV to movies.
4138000	4142000	But if you go from TV to movies and you get like...
4142000	4147000	You can hit like these thermal vents of success and then you have a 25-year career.
4147000	4148000	Yeah, Matthew McConaughey.
4148000	4151000	Like he went away and now he's writing high in a thermal right now.
4152000	4155000	I'm just speaking strictly about like TV actor, you know.
4156000	4158000	Like making that jump where it's like...
4158000	4159000	Because there is that like...
4159000	4160000	We kind of haze people.
4160000	4161000	We go like, what?
4161000	4163000	I don't want to watch Andy Murphy in a movie.
4166000	4168000	But anyways...
4168000	4169000	Anyways.
4169000	4170000	How about those cops, huh?
4170000	4171000	Hey, yeah.
4171000	4173000	I see your retweets.
4173000	4174000	You're kind of a dissident.
4175000	4179000	You're on the side of the anarchist.
4179000	4180000	Yeah, you know.
4180000	4184000	No, I'm on the side of people who don't kill people for no reason.
4186000	4187000	No, no, no.
4188000	4190000	It's a bald stance, Graham.
4193000	4194000	For an Irishman?
4194000	4196000	If you adjust for Irishness?
4197000	4203000	But no, I just think that I try and retweet things that aren't going to inflame things.
4203000	4204000	I try and be careful.
4204000	4205000	I try and...
4206000	4208000	You know, after a few early mistakes on Twitter,
4208000	4214000	I'm very careful before I tweet something that looks like it's going to just kind of burst into flames.
4214000	4215000	You know what I mean?
4215000	4218000	Do you address if you...
4218000	4219000	Because I know you don't...
4220000	4223000	Sorry to interrupt, but what you were saying earlier...
4223000	4224000	No, fuck you.
4226000	4230000	To me, it's the most fascinating thing because it's the camera thing.
4230000	4233000	It's the fact that we all have cameras,
4233000	4236000	and all this stuff has just been going on forever,
4236000	4240000	and now we can just see it, and it's like light's been switched on,
4240000	4243000	and everyone's going, oh, look at all this shit in here, you know?
4243000	4246000	And that's what I just find fascinating about it,
4246000	4251000	and I think that I like to try and make the light reach further,
4251000	4252000	and I got a big follow...
4252000	4258000	For me, a big following, so I get to spread it about a bit.
4258000	4259000	It's an interesting analogy.
4259000	4262000	People tend to think of it in terms of bandwidth,
4262000	4264000	or like extra channels and things,
4264000	4267000	but to think about it in terms of like we've been groping around in the dark,
4267000	4270000	in candlelight or something, and then they have the lights go.
4270000	4271000	Yeah, yeah.
4271000	4275000	And there's this sort of like, oh my God,
4275000	4278000	that person looks completely different than I thought they did.
4278000	4280000	There's more people over here.
4280000	4282000	They weren't even making any sound.
4282000	4283000	Now I can see them.
4283000	4286000	And there's some people that are reacting to that.
4286000	4289000	There's part of the human instinct that you scream in terror
4289000	4291000	and you start doing crazy shit,
4291000	4293000	and then there's other people who are like,
4293000	4296000	wait, we can scientifically find out more now.
4296000	4299000	Yeah, but the problem for the police, I think,
4299000	4304000	is that I would imagine there's a few systems that they have in place.
4304000	4308000	You know, if you shoot a guy and just drop a knife near the thing,
4308000	4310000	but that doesn't work anymore,
4310000	4313000	because now there's two shots, and do you know what I mean?
4313000	4318000	And I don't think that they're just going to have to adjust.
4318000	4320000	It'll be interesting to see how that plays out, though,
4320000	4323000	because we have this overwhelming tendency to side with the system
4323000	4326000	that keeps us safe at night, and it does keep us safe at night.
4326000	4330000	And it's like, one of the most disturbing things that we're seeing
4330000	4334000	is the revelation of, I think as Jeff has always said,
4334000	4336000	we're a right of center country.
4336000	4340000	We can talk all we want about how we have a bipartisan system and blah, blah, blah.
4340000	4345000	In an empirically ideological spectrum, we are right of center.
4345000	4348000	We're a fucking empire. We'd have to be right of center.
4348000	4351000	We can't be centrist and control the planet.
4351000	4355000	We have to have a conservative slant on things.
4355000	4358000	We like the way things were yesterday a little bit more
4358000	4361000	than we like things that are going to be tomorrow.
4361000	4363000	Yeah, we didn't have to think about any of this stuff in the past.
4363000	4366000	You know, the cops were great, criminals were bad.
4366000	4368000	Even if we don't like cops,
4368000	4371000	even if we have no reason to love them
4371000	4373000	and it's not going to line our pocketbooks or anything,
4373000	4379000	there is a muscle that flexes when somebody says in an article,
4379000	4384000	this guy's like, forget about cops, let's broaden this out into,
4384000	4387000	I don't want to fan flames with my language,
4387000	4391000	but can we just speak and stuff, the rape culture consciousness,
4391000	4394000	everything that we're talking about right now.
4394000	4397000	There's a phenomenon that happens, I think, when you read a piece,
4397000	4400000	somebody is activated, somebody is being an activist
4400000	4402000	and they're writing an editorial piece.
4402000	4406000	There's a muscle that I feel that reacts
4406000	4408000	before I even know what I'm doing.
4408000	4412000	I want to compensate because I don't want to all at once
4412000	4416000	just be told that everything is darkness and blood
4416000	4421000	and terror and wrong and what I thought was black is white.
4421000	4426000	But I think the way you can live in the modern world
4426000	4429000	and be okay about it is you've got to think to yourself,
4429000	4431000	you're helping the good cops.
4431000	4434000	The good cops don't do stuff like this.
4434000	4438000	So if you're shining a light on the bad cops, you're helping the good cops.
4438000	4442000	So if we want to help the good cops, we've got to do this.
4442000	4445000	We've got to try and get the word out about the bad cops.
4445000	4450000	When you get mad, you retweet, you curate,
4450000	4455000	you present these articles and I click on them and I go, wow, Graham's the kind of guy
4455000	4459000	I want to be, like he reads.
4459000	4466000	I just click on what you read and I skim it and I go, you know what's fucked up?
4466000	4470000	There's these drones.
4470000	4475000	They're everywhere. Just trust me.
4475000	4484000	But it's like when do you, are you ever supposed to say,
4484000	4488000	it's a dumb question because it's a case by case basis.
4488000	4491000	I think there's some people on Twitter that we want to,
4491000	4494000	I don't want to hear what Angie Harmon has to say about it.
4494000	4496000	I don't want to hear what Dan Harmon has to say probably.
4496000	4499000	There might be other people that it's like, yeah, fuck yeah,
4499000	4502000	I want to hear what Patton Oswalt has to say.
4502000	4505000	But it's the other people I'm more interested in,
4505000	4510000	the people who are near the scene and take a picture.
4510000	4513000	They're the people, that's one of the reasons I love Twitter.
4513000	4516000	I mean, it's brilliant being in touch with people like you
4516000	4518000	and other people I admire.
4518000	4522000	But it's also great when something happens to drill down
4522000	4525000	and find the first person who saw it.
4525000	4527000	That's the thing when you're talking about the light coming on
4527000	4529000	and seeing all the cockroaches that we didn't know that were there
4529000	4531000	on the kitchen floor.
4531000	4535000	My implied fear for me is that the light can go out
4535000	4538000	and when that light goes out, we're all going to be fucking horrified.
4538000	4543000	That's why I think everyone should be a member of the EFF over here,
4543000	4545000	the Open Rights Group in the States.
4545000	4550000	The thing you should fight more than anything else is your internet rights
4550000	4556000	because we suddenly have this ability to see and to talk to each other.
4556000	4561000	And it's being chipped away all the time, just little things,
4561000	4563000	like net neutrality and all that sort of stuff.
4563000	4567000	They're constantly trying to stop us from talking to each other.
4567000	4571000	But we've suddenly got a bit more power now and we shouldn't give it up easily.
4571000	4573000	We're going to look back on these days and we're going to be like,
4573000	4575000	holy shit, you could...
4575000	4577000	Can you imagine?
4577000	4579000	I think there's a lot of bad things about it.
4579000	4583000	I feel sometimes that I don't have as many physical friends in meat space
4583000	4586000	as they say, as I used to.
4586000	4589000	And the people I know on Twitter and so on,
4589000	4591000	I know them in a very light way.
4591000	4594000	You can literally just make them go away if you want to.
4594000	4596000	I think that's a bit sad.
4596000	4599000	But at the same time, I think there was some way
4599000	4602000	in which we were all a bit lonely before this
4602000	4604000	and suddenly we can all talk to each other.
4604000	4606000	I think that's incredible.
4606000	4609000	And when people used to kind of come down hard on Twitter and Facebook,
4609000	4614000	I used to get really annoyed because the social network film just really annoys me
4614000	4619000	because Sorkin there is just basically like, you little nerds.
4619000	4623000	He said in an interview, they said to him, are you on Facebook?
4623000	4625000	And he says, no.
4625000	4628000	Isn't this fine, having a conversation?
4628000	4631000	Everyone gets interviewed by journalists.
4631000	4633000	And you see it as well.
4633000	4635000	Comedians making fun of it.
4635000	4638000	Not everyone's got a microphone in their hands.
4638000	4643000	And it's this kind of jealousy of wanting to preserve the stage to yourself
4643000	4645000	because you're a writer.
4645000	4648000	It used to be that when Aaron Sorkin opened his mouth,
4648000	4651000	everybody would listen and no one would be able to talk back to him.
4652000	4657000	I mean, it's probably the part of me that overlaps with Aaron Sorkin
4657000	4661000	thinks that probably another thing he hates because before he hated it,
4661000	4663000	he had some dalliances.
4663000	4665000	He had a couple like I did.
4665000	4668000	When I got rehired for the fifth season of Community,
4668000	4672000	I was on a high and I wanted to have a conversation with people.
4672000	4674000	I felt good about myself again.
4674000	4679000	And within three conversation threads, I created four TMZ headlines.
4680000	4683000	And then I recoiled and I was like, well, Reddit is.
4683000	4686000	I could easily said, well, Reddit is stupid.
4686000	4689000	What I instead said, I probably say that all the time,
4689000	4696000	but the reality is Reddit is not for me right now
4696000	4701000	until I am back to being a conversant on equal ground.
4701000	4703000	There's weird things out there.
4703000	4707000	The whole hashtag outrage thing is so annoying.
4707000	4711000	I agree with Patton Aswell that it's dangerous for comedians
4711000	4714000	because you have to watch yourself so carefully.
4714000	4717000	Twitter is not a good place to develop material.
4717000	4719000	Let's put it that way.
4719000	4721000	Graham, do you engage with your detractors?
4721000	4723000	Do you go back and forth and do you leave them?
4723000	4725000	No, I block them.
4725000	4726000	I love the mute button.
4726000	4727000	That's my favorite thing.
4727000	4729000	The mute is pretty great, but if they talk directly to you,
4729000	4731000	it just goes right to you.
4731000	4733000	We were talking about this the other day.
4733000	4735000	No, once I mute them, they're gone.
4736000	4739000	But if they say to you, if they say at glitter...
4739000	4741000	No, no.
4741000	4742000	I don't think so.
4742000	4743000	I can never get this straight.
4743000	4745000	Does anybody have this straight in their goddamn head?
4745000	4748000	No, and I like to ask them a question just before I mute them.
4748000	4751000	I like to say something like, what makes you think that?
4756000	4758000	If that's really what mute is and I'm muting everybody,
4758000	4763000	I could swear, I think that mute only works with people that are like,
4764000	4766000	hey, I'm live tweeting the Super Bowl.
4766000	4769000	And it's like, I love you to death, but don't live tweet the Super Bowl.
4769000	4772000	And then you mute them because they're not talking to you.
4772000	4777000	But if they were to say, that touchdown reminds me of Dan Harmon.
4777000	4779000	It'll override the mute.
4779000	4781000	Maybe it does work like that.
4781000	4784000	And it's just that no one has replied to me after I muted them.
4784000	4787000	Yeah, the only people that I...
4787000	4789000	Most of the people that I want to mute,
4789000	4792000	we're talking about people that are talking directly to me.
4792000	4797000	Yeah, I only mute rude people or people who say something that's just so dumb.
4797000	4800000	Or one guy like today who said,
4800000	4803000	I said, does anyone know any good places to eat in Los Angeles or something?
4803000	4805000	And he replied, no.
4807000	4809000	And he was like, bye-bye.
4811000	4813000	Too snarky, too cynical.
4813000	4815000	There must be a good place to grab a nibble.
4815000	4818000	I tell you, another thing about the internet,
4818000	4820000	and I'm not sure if it's a good thing or a bad thing,
4820000	4824000	is that it seems to me that you've got the high-level sociopaths
4824000	4828000	who are burying people in shallow graves.
4828000	4830000	And then you've got kind of lower-level,
4830000	4833000	who never really had a way of expressing themselves till now.
4833000	4836000	And it's these lower-level sociopaths
4836000	4840000	who are like the whole gamer-gate thing at the moment.
4840000	4845000	There was a discussion on one 8chan or 4chan,
4845000	4846000	one of these things,
4846000	4849000	where they were seriously discussing
4849000	4852000	how they could make transsexuals kill themselves.
4852000	4855000	They were saying, everything's in operation.
4855000	4858000	This is Operation Junebug or something.
4858000	4860000	We'll send them this picture.
4860000	4863000	And there's a list of links of photographs to send transsexuals.
4863000	4865000	Yeah, so it's a bunch of zodiac killers who didn't kill people.
4865000	4867000	They just like writing the letters.
4867000	4868000	Exactly, exactly.
4868000	4870000	Yeah, yeah.
4871000	4876000	Yeah, it's like, who is the bully?
4876000	4881000	That's the dangerous thing that's happened is like,
4881000	4884000	I got bullied, I got bullied, I got bullied.
4884000	4886000	You can become a kind of person that's like,
4886000	4888000	I've felt that way so often.
4888000	4892000	I've been in crowded restaurants and people,
4892000	4894000	and I've thought, you know what,
4894000	4896000	I'm feeling the exact same feelings right now
4896000	4898000	that a supervillain feels.
4898000	4901000	I would really like to blow this place up.
4901000	4903000	I would really like to, not hurt,
4903000	4906000	but just kill so many people.
4906000	4908000	And I don't, I would never,
4908000	4911000	the minute I'd have to go to a store and buy a red wire and a blue wire,
4911000	4915000	which as far as I understand is how you make a bomb.
4915000	4919000	You didn't hear that here.
4919000	4922000	I would go like, it's just too hard, red wires and blue wires.
4922000	4925000	And also, not too hard, but also I'm not going to do it.
4925000	4926000	I don't actually really be responsible,
4926000	4929000	because I can't handle it when someone calls me an asshole on Twitter.
4929000	4931000	I don't want to see their body blow up.
4931000	4936000	Maybe that's good for your low-level aspiring high-level sociopath.
4936000	4939000	For your low-level sociopath, they're getting it out of their system maybe.
4939000	4940000	Yeah, who knows?
4940000	4941000	They're playing a sandbox of sociopath.
4941000	4945000	Adolescents, I mean, that's what an adolescent does.
4945000	4947000	Your body, they don't like to hear this.
4947000	4949000	I didn't like to hear this when I was an adolescent.
4949000	4953000	No one likes to hear that your personality is based on blood chemistry.
4953000	4957000	But you are fucking full of testosterone.
4957000	4960000	Don't you lose empathy for a while when you're a teenager?
4960000	4962000	It's like two years you lose empathy.
4962000	4964000	Well, and the parts of your brain that are lighting up
4964000	4966000	are like the primate brain as it's going through puberty,
4966000	4968000	the male primate brain.
4968000	4971000	The violence and the sex sections are overlapping.
4971000	4974000	I'm speaking really scientifically right now.
4974000	4976000	You got to look it up.
4976000	4982000	But you are, I feel comfortable saying this because we've been there.
4982000	4990000	We were all adolescent boys, all of us, the three of us at least.
4990000	4997000	You remember the lack of control you had over what your ideas really were.
4997000	5006000	You had no real, you were a puppet of what a serial killer's testimony might call
5006000	5008000	the dog next door.
5008000	5012000	You were answering to a lower or higher calling.
5012000	5015000	You were all horn dog, like weird.
5015000	5017000	And it's not just about sex.
5017000	5020000	It's not just about the fact that your dick is like a little wood paneling nail
5020000	5027000	and your pants the whole time, no matter how much you rub it.
5027000	5032000	What goes with that is like your feelings about...
5032000	5035000	Dan Chogram.
5035000	5037000	Were you doing a call out?
5037000	5039000	How you rub it?
5039000	5043000	Like the end of a commercial.
5043000	5045000	How you rub it?
5045000	5047000	No, no, I was like, oh, you rub it.
5047000	5049000	Oh, you rub it.
5049000	5051000	Yes, you rub it.
5051000	5054000	After 30, it makes it go down.
5054000	5057000	But tell them, anybody's guess.
5057000	5060000	Then you start to take the pills, you keep it up.
5060000	5064000	The personality that comes along with that, you're constantly like the kid,
5064000	5068000	they do fucked up shit, like kids left unchecked.
5068000	5071000	I think gamer gay is mostly kids.
5071000	5077000	Of course it is. You're watching, am I going to get fucking egged?
5077000	5080000	Am I going to get my fucking social security number?
5080000	5083000	Well, Sony already made sure that's going to happen.
5083000	5087000	Graham, are there certain years that teenagers lose their empathy?
5087000	5091000	I don't know. I read it somewhere, again, not very scientific.
5091000	5093000	Did you go through phases? I know I did.
5093000	5096000	I went through, I guess I never thought of it like that,
5096000	5099000	but did you go through a phase where you went through it?
5099000	5104000	I did that thing where you care less about the people you love for a bit, maybe.
5104000	5108000	But I was just so wrapped up in my own unhappiness.
5108000	5110000	Which town are you from?
5110000	5112000	Dublin.
5112000	5116000	I had a roommate that was from Dublin, and he got his ass kicked daily.
5116000	5118000	Is that why you saw Father Ted?
5118000	5122000	No, my friends that turn me on to are all Americans.
5122000	5126000	But they all love British TV and stuff, Irish TV.
5126000	5129000	It is kind of British TV.
5129000	5131000	Exactly.
5131000	5137000	My friend, describing being a preteen and a teenager in Dublin,
5137000	5141000	was just a daily deciding, do I run home and get beat up by my father,
5141000	5145000	or do I turn and fight and fight like 40 people?
5145000	5148000	My mum, I never got that too bad.
5148000	5154000	It was all psychological torture, but my mum was always just full of stories
5154000	5158000	about some kid who would just walk home and just get the shit kicked out of him
5158000	5160000	for no reason.
5160000	5162000	It was a bit fearful.
5162000	5164000	It sounds weird, though.
5164000	5167000	This was Ireland in the 70s and 80s.
5167000	5171000	That's the thing about now, pornography.
5171000	5173000	Is pornography a good thing?
5173000	5175000	It's still a thing, yeah.
5176000	5178000	Do you still rub it?
5178000	5180000	In Ireland.
5180000	5185000	But in Ireland, when you're going through that crazy insane time
5185000	5188000	before the internet and in a Catholic country...
5188000	5190000	You had to hump a pillow.
5190000	5193000	No, there were photography magazines,
5193000	5198000	and there was a magazine called H&E, which stood for health and efficiency,
5198000	5202000	and it was a nudist magazine that somehow got through the censorship
5202000	5205000	about the nudism, which was a hobby.
5205000	5207000	And it was always a really good-looking...
5207000	5209000	It's not like medical nudism.
5209000	5212000	Yeah, but there was always a really good-looking woman on the cover,
5212000	5215000	and you'd wander over and pretend to be looking at other things for a while,
5215000	5218000	and then you'd just kind of reach up casually and take it down and look at it
5218000	5223000	and open it up, and everything was like old men and little kids holding hands.
5227000	5229000	But the cover was always beautiful.
5229000	5231000	Dan, don't rub it.
5232000	5236000	I'm a pretty firm believer that the mitigation of resources available to you
5236000	5238000	when you're in that state are not...
5238000	5244000	You can't farm that field to control the crop.
5245000	5248000	You mean you'll always see weird stuff that you don't want to see?
5248000	5249000	Oh, my God.
5249000	5252000	You know, you'd masturbate to a piece of driftwood.
5253000	5255000	You've got to be kidding me.
5255000	5257000	You live by the sea.
5258000	5264000	The content that they're showing you, it's like,
5264000	5268000	oh, well, this is for kids, but it's like, yeah, but that's still round.
5270000	5272000	I mean, I remember being this age.
5272000	5275000	But I did want to say one thing about that, because it's like we're saying,
5275000	5280000	the Gamergate, as relates to adolescent, uncontrollable rage,
5280000	5285000	and it's unrefined, and it's like we've, in America at least,
5285000	5288000	I don't know how it works in Europe, but we have...
5288000	5291000	We love our infantilization.
5291000	5293000	We love taking away ritual.
5293000	5298000	We love taking away the things that used to mean something in a tribal society.
5298000	5302000	They have been systematically, probably usually for good reasons,
5302000	5305000	vilified and taken away and put in a bin, because it's like,
5305000	5306000	are you kidding me?
5306000	5310000	This notion that a father and a son are more important than the government,
5310000	5311000	that's fucking crazy.
5311000	5314000	And it's like everyone kind of grows up.
5314000	5318000	Children and our children in this childish country are like,
5318000	5319000	they're particularly vulnerable.
5319000	5322000	They're 14 years old, and they're fucking on fire.
5322000	5325000	Every cell in their body is on fire.
5325000	5329000	And they do some cool shit sometimes.
5329000	5334000	The Mountain Dew campaign, where they asked everybody to vote for a new flavor
5334000	5337000	of Mountain Dew, you get to name our new flavor.
5337000	5342000	And I got all sensitivity to anybody that would be offended by this aside.
5342000	5348000	Please recognize the artistic integrity of this in the face of corporate oligarchy.
5348000	5353000	This is like the 4chan kids all ganged up and just flood this thing.
5353000	5357000	And the new Mountain Dew flavor, they had to cancel it because the new Mountain Dew flavor
5357000	5360000	was going to be called Hitler Did Nothing Wrong.
5360000	5362000	For real?
5362000	5365000	And it's like, yeah, fucking take that.
5365000	5366000	Wait, wait.
5366000	5369000	How do they promote that ground for all?
5369000	5371000	This is all about coordinated strikes.
5371000	5375000	This is people who live online and who understand that world.
5375000	5378000	We're in water world, and they're all Kevin Costner.
5378000	5381000	They have the gills, so they dive down.
5381000	5384000	They can drink their own pee, and they can breathe underwater,
5384000	5386000	and they know where the old world is.
5386000	5390000	And the shame about it is that they don't use their powers for good.
5390000	5393000	They sometimes do, sorry.
5393000	5399000	Again, with all due deference to anybody who was murdered by Hitler or anything like that,
5400000	5404000	that is an example of actually kind of, in my opinion, good.
5404000	5408000	It's anti-corporate, anti-establishment energy, and it's fun.
5408000	5409000	I know what you're saying.
5409000	5413000	And it causes you to laugh, and that's good.
5413000	5415000	You wouldn't do that if you were 25.
5415000	5417000	You wouldn't do that if you were 35.
5417000	5420000	It takes a bunch of 14-year-olds to do something like that.
5420000	5422000	You kind of look out your window at that lawn and you go,
5422000	5424000	don't get off my lawn.
5424000	5425000	That's pretty funny.
5425000	5427000	I wonder what it tasted like.
5428000	5433000	It was kind of like raspberry.
5433000	5436000	And then the great thing was all the Photoshop images of,
5436000	5438000	what if they had let it through?
5438000	5440000	What if they had been accountable to their own rules
5440000	5443000	so all the storefronts would be filled with these two-liter bottles of,
5443000	5445000	Hitler did nothing wrong?
5445000	5449000	There's two old guys sitting in a porch, and they've got their Iwo Jima hats on,
5449000	5451000	and they're like, it's pretty good.
5451000	5454000	It's a hugely important thing.
5455000	5456000	What is that?
5456000	5457000	What is this interactivity?
5457000	5458000	Oh, it's a contest.
5458000	5459000	You get to help out.
5459000	5460000	You're a consumer.
5460000	5461000	And it's like, fuck you.
5461000	5462000	It's fucking beautiful.
5462000	5463000	I love all that.
5463000	5466000	I'm like, barf back along that food line.
5466000	5468000	There's barf coming out of here.
5468000	5470000	Do you follow Neil Hamburger on Twitter?
5470000	5472000	No, I don't.
5472000	5473000	He's so funny.
5473000	5478000	He just finds every corporate account and retweets it along with a comment,
5478000	5483000	and he just ruins all these competitions and stuff they have.
5483000	5484000	Do you remember any good ones?
5484000	5487000	He retweets everyone who says Taco Bell made me cute.
5487000	5488000	That's right.
5488000	5490000	He'll just spend a whole evening doing it.
5490000	5493000	He's like 40 people next Monday.
5493000	5494000	He's really good.
5494000	5497000	My friend, I think it was Ray Pruitt who's been kind of brought up on Hormontown
5497000	5498000	before.
5498000	5499000	He's my friend from Texas.
5499000	5502000	He's kind of in a weird street theater kind of organization.
5502000	5507000	They do weird kind of guerrilla theater, like anti-comedy,
5507000	5511000	kind of like situationist kind of shit.
5511000	5512000	Pranks and stuff.
5512000	5515000	Actually, I think it was either him or another friend of mine,
5515000	5516000	but it doesn't matter.
5516000	5518000	There was a thing on the radio.
5518000	5522000	The radio was a thing where you could turn on a thing in your car
5522000	5524000	and there'd be music and then news and stuff.
5524000	5527000	It was like, all right, it's K-A-F-W-B.
5527000	5529000	It's all Beatles and all the time.
5529000	5531000	You all vote your favorite Beatles song.
5531000	5533000	You ever call in and vote your favorite Beatles song?
5533000	5536000	We're going to play that same song for 24 hours.
5536000	5537000	So call in.
5537000	5541000	They just got everybody in Oklahoma to vote for Hey Bulldog.
5541000	5552000	So the guy's like, all right, it's 24 hours of Hey Bulldog.
5552000	5557000	It's a Beatles song that you don't know, Dan Harmon.
5557000	5561000	It's not a bad song, but nobody wants 24 hours of it.
5561000	5563000	The radio station stuck to their guns
5563000	5566000	and they played 24 fucking hours of Hey Bulldog.
5566000	5567000	And everybody else just danced to it,
5567000	5570000	and then they all got sick of it again and they were sad about it.
5570000	5571000	Uh-oh.
5571000	5573000	It's the best new hamburger.
5573000	5574000	Oh, shit.
5574000	5576000	Actually, could you read that?
5576000	5579000	I just got new glasses, and I never wore glasses before
5579000	5583000	because I'm getting old, you know, and I need glasses now.
5583000	5587000	So it's frightening because I do this, and it's like, everything's normal.
5587000	5590000	I do this, so I'm going to die.
5590000	5591000	Sorry?
5591000	5595000	I started thinking, I just don't seem to be able to read
5595000	5598000	that sign across the road or whatever.
5598000	5600000	So it just got a bit.
5600000	5601000	But it's terrifying.
5601000	5603000	I do this and I get sad.
5603000	5605000	Well, let me see you with all the glasses.
5605000	5606000	That's what you normally look like.
5606000	5607000	You look like Jerry O'Connell a little bit.
5607000	5608000	Jerry O'Connell?
5608000	5609000	Yeah.
5609000	5610000	He's an American actor, right?
5610000	5611000	Take him off.
5611000	5612000	Look at him a little bit.
5612000	5613000	Little Jerry O'Connell?
5613000	5614000	Yeah?
5614000	5615000	Yeah, right?
5615000	5616000	I'll take that.
5616000	5617000	I'll take any actor over me.
5617000	5619000	You ever see Jerry Maguire?
5619000	5620000	Oh, yeah.
5620000	5621000	Okay.
5621000	5623000	He's the quarterback, and he's Cuba Gooding's friend.
5623000	5624000	What else is he in for?
5624000	5625000	Sliders.
5625000	5626000	Sliders.
5626000	5627000	He seems sliders.
5627000	5628000	No.
5628000	5629000	Did you put him in an I.T. crowd?
5629000	5630000	Yeah, okay.
5630000	5631000	Okay, yeah.
5631000	5633000	I'll be in it, too.
5633000	5634000	What was the Olive Garden tweet?
5634000	5635000	I don't know.
5635000	5638000	Oh, I don't have Adam Goldberg's thumb.
5638000	5639000	Oh, no.
5639000	5640000	Let's do the joke, guys.
5640000	5641000	Sorry.
5641000	5642000	I turned it off.
5642000	5643000	Can you remember what it said?
5643000	5644000	Yeah.
5644000	5645000	That's Adam Goldberg.
5645000	5646000	I don't know.
5646000	5648000	Adam Goldberg's like our Gonzo from our Marvel show.
5648000	5650000	I'm what you'd call a backbencher.
5650000	5651000	Okay.
5651000	5652000	For us.
5653000	5655000	The joke, Olive Garden, says,
5655000	5660000	please, in three words, name what describes Italian food.
5660000	5662000	And he said, not Olive Garden.
5664000	5665000	That's...
5665000	5666000	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
5666000	5668000	Adam Goldberg.
5673000	5674000	Good to see you, Adam.
5674000	5675000	Hey, hey, hey.
5675000	5676000	There's going to be a...
5676000	5679000	There's a significant crisis here without Spencer here.
5679000	5680000	I like what's happening here.
5680000	5682000	We're having an adult conversation.
5682000	5683000	No, no, no.
5683000	5684000	We're doing fine.
5684000	5686000	Everything that's happening right now is fine.
5686000	5688000	That sounds like I'm protesting too much.
5688000	5692000	I'm just saying, like, we don't have a show closer,
5692000	5693000	is all upset.
5693000	5694000	Have we ever had a show closer?
5694000	5695000	We've never had a show closer.
5695000	5696000	I'm not saying...
5696000	5697000	Don't you play Dungeons and Dragons?
5697000	5698000	Oh, it's a great way to show.
5698000	5699000	I'm just saying we always did that.
5699000	5701000	Hey, we both done Dungeons and Dragons episodes as well.
5701000	5702000	Yeah, yeah, we did.
5702000	5705000	Yeah, because I love your Dungeons and Dragons episodes.
5705000	5707000	I watched yours before we did ours, and I watched...
5707000	5708000	Did you?
5708000	5709000	Did I write it before yours?
5709000	5710000	Yeah.
5710000	5711000	I thought you were before me for some reason.
5711000	5712000	Oh, no, man.
5712000	5713000	Grandpa.
5713000	5717000	Grandpa, you just went into one of my favorite things
5717000	5719000	that Irish sometimes do is when they get excited,
5719000	5720000	they go falsetto.
5720000	5721000	All right.
5721000	5723000	Is that what you're talking about?
5725000	5726000	Why did you...
5726000	5727000	I love that.
5727000	5728000	Did you follow me rainbow all the way here?
5728000	5731000	Why did you follow me rainbow all the way here?
5731000	5733000	I have a particular set of skills.
5739000	5740000	I'm not...
5740000	5743000	I don't think that I'm nothing scared by this guy.
5743000	5744000	It's a lot of...
5744000	5745000	I thought...
5745000	5746000	I thought I watched yours!
5746000	5749000	Liam Neeson on the phone with his pot of gold.
5750000	5753000	In a few minutes, they're going to take you.
5754000	5756000	Here's what you do.
5756000	5758000	Tell them they get three wishes.
5758000	5761000	I'm going to grant them, but ironically...
5761000	5769000	No, I used to play...
5769000	5771000	Did you ever play Call of Cthulhu?
5771000	5772000	No.
5772000	5773000	Oh, man.
5773000	5774000	You should get into that.
5774000	5775000	I'm kind of like...
5775000	5776000	I'm having a...
5776000	5779000	I want to get into Lovecraft now.
5779000	5780000	Yeah.
5780000	5781000	Really late.
5781000	5782000	Yeah, yeah.
5782000	5784000	I just bothered to ask the question like,
5784000	5786000	what is the deal with this Lovecraft shit?
5786000	5788000	Yeah, I find him really hard to read.
5788000	5789000	He's kind of...
5789000	5790000	I find him a bit boring.
5790000	5792000	You're talking about reading H.P. Lovecraft,
5792000	5793000	or is there a game called Lovecraft?
5793000	5795000	No, there's a game called Call of Cthulhu
5795000	5797000	based on H.P. Lovecraft stories.
5797000	5799000	I was just talking about the whole milieu.
5799000	5801000	I think it's interesting that there was a guy
5801000	5804000	that died so long ago that people still, to this day,
5804000	5805000	kind of...
5805000	5806000	It's easy to avoid.
5806000	5807000	You should read.
5807000	5808000	I've got other shit to do, but it's like...
5808000	5810000	The scariest take on Lovecraft I've read
5810000	5813000	is actually Alan Moore's Lovecraft comics.
5813000	5814000	Has anyone ever read them?
5814000	5816000	Oh, Alan Moore wrote Lovecraft comics?
5816000	5818000	Yeah, he wrote two comics
5818000	5821000	that are just Lovecraft stories, and they're horrible.
5821000	5822000	Oh, boy.
5822000	5823000	They're so frightening.
5823000	5824000	Yeah, that seems like a match made in hell.
5824000	5826000	It's one of those things where you're reading it
5826000	5829000	and halfway through you wish you were reading it.
5829000	5831000	Well, that's the theme of Lovecraft.
5831000	5832000	Yeah.
5832000	5833000	The universe, right?
5833000	5834000	Yeah, yeah.
5834000	5835000	You get a book and you open it, and you go like,
5835000	5836000	oh my God, now I...
5836000	5838000	You really feel like some bad is going for it.
5838000	5839000	Maybe that's what he was going for.
5839000	5840000	Alan Moore's like a genius, right?
5840000	5841000	Yeah, no, no.
5841000	5843000	It's great, but it's horribly great, you know?
5843000	5845000	It's so funny that Alan Moore is like...
5845000	5848000	He's like a refined version of Stephen King,
5848000	5851000	and so much of his shit has been turned into bad shit,
5851000	5853000	but unlike Stephen King, he's not cool with any of it.
5853000	5854000	Yeah, he hates it.
5854000	5857000	Stephen King's like, hey, maybe The Shining was all right.
5857000	5859000	I changed my mind.
5859000	5862000	Yeah, I met him a few times, and I told him
5862000	5865000	I hadn't seen the Watchmen film, and he hugged me.
5865000	5868000	What to say?
5868000	5869000	You got to get out there.
5869000	5870000	No, no, no.
5870000	5872000	He's just very happy, very happy that I didn't
5872000	5873000	and wouldn't see it.
5874000	5875000	I got to watch this.
5875000	5877000	There's a documentary that's very gonzo,
5877000	5880000	just him talking.
5880000	5882000	I didn't really realize...
5882000	5885000	Last year, I realized that Alan Moore was the common thread
5885000	5888000	between so many things that were so culturally effective.
5888000	5890000	I got to get caught up on this guy.
5890000	5891000	He's great.
5891000	5892000	He's great.
5892000	5894000	What were you talking to him for?
5894000	5896000	I went to a dinner, and he was invited...
5896000	5899000	No, I was invited to meet him by a comic shop in London
5899000	5902000	called Gosh Comics, which is a great comic shop in London.
5902000	5905000	There's almost nothing you can say that someone won't clap for.
5905000	5908000	That was a pretty deep cut.
5908000	5910000	Are you from London?
5910000	5912000	Awesome.
5912000	5915000	We just had a nice dinner.
5915000	5919000	How are you going to make an IT crowd good for NBC?
5919000	5923000	Well, with Neil Goldman.
5923000	5927000	The thing is, they very kindly asked me to come over
5927000	5930000	after I kind of forced them to ask me,
5931000	5935000	because all I want to do is pitch my idea
5935000	5937000	of what the show could be over here.
5937000	5940000	It would be unfair for me to say it out here
5940000	5942000	before I say it to them.
5942000	5946000	I was thinking about Studio sitcoms in the States,
5946000	5949000	and it seems to me there's only one show...
5949000	5953000	No, there's two shows that are like my show
5953000	5956000	that are in front of an audience in the States,
5956000	5958000	Married with Children.
5959000	5961000	Yeah, not like in terms of quality.
5961000	5964000	The quality was up and down, but it was the same...
5964000	5966000	There was no quality.
5966000	5969000	Did you ever see the episode where they all had to get their haircut
5969000	5972000	at the lady's salon? That's very funny.
5972000	5974000	I think I saw every episode of that show,
5974000	5976000	but what was great about it, it was like,
5976000	5979000	you felt like you were watching a show that was made in someone's basement.
5979000	5981000	It was so crappy.
5981000	5985000	But it's similar to my show in that it's kind of not set in the real world
5985000	5987000	in some ways. It's kind of heightened.
5987000	5989000	You're talking about the relationship between reality and...
5989000	5992000	Yeah, and the other one is Soap. Remember Soap?
5992000	5994000	Soap had that same kind of crazy...
5994000	5997000	But I remember Soap as a child, so I remember it as a grown-up show,
5997000	5999000	so I don't remember it having Mystical...
5999000	6003000	The ventriloquist dummy, the man and all that sort of stuff.
6003000	6005000	So it was kind of crazy.
6005000	6009000	And in later seasons, they had aliens kidnapping the guy.
6009000	6011000	So it got really insane.
6011000	6014000	So they're the only two shows that seem to be kind of insane
6014000	6016000	in the way that my stuff sometimes is.
6016000	6019000	So you're going to tell Bob Greenblatt, I want it to be Soap again.
6019000	6022000	No, no, no. The opposite. The opposite.
6022000	6024000	I mean, again, I don't want to say too much,
6024000	6027000	but I'm going to say to try and pull back on all that stuff
6027000	6032000	and do what American shows do so well, you know, character.
6032000	6036000	And in terms of studio sitcoms, I'm thinking in terms of things like Cheers
6036000	6039000	and Seinfeld, which I've said it before,
6039000	6043000	but IT crowd is just me trying to copy Seinfeld and getting it wrong.
6044000	6047000	I worship that show.
6047000	6051000	Those were some of the happiest years of my life watching Seinfeld.
6051000	6054000	Yeah, I got caught up with it in syndication
6054000	6058000	and I didn't really realize the extent to which I was ripping it off
6058000	6062000	until I observed other sitcoms and how structurally they were different
6062000	6064000	from community.
6064000	6068000	I thought that I was doing Star Trek because the bridge of the Enterprise
6068000	6072000	was so necessary. So the study room was like the bridge of the Enterprise.
6072000	6074000	But it was really like that was Seinfeld's kitchen.
6074000	6077000	And so you go like A story, B story, and then they split off
6077000	6080000	and then they reconvene in an ideal community episode,
6080000	6082000	which there are so few of.
6082000	6084000	They always go astray.
6084000	6089000	But yeah, it's like you have everybody coming in and going like,
6089000	6091000	I have this problem. I have that problem.
6091000	6093000	And then they split off into these crazy things.
6093000	6096000	And that wonderful thing that Seinfeld would often do
6096000	6101000	where you just did not know how they were going to connect the two storylines
6101000	6103000	until a second before it happens.
6103000	6109000	And then you'd get this little explosion of joy when you realized.
6109000	6112000	I mean, one example that's kind of not an example
6112000	6116000	because it was slightly forced but still great is Kramer
6116000	6119000	being mistaken for someone who's got mental problems
6119000	6122000	and ends up singing to Mel Torme.
6122000	6124000	Mel Torme ends up singing to him.
6124000	6125000	Have you not seen that?
6125000	6126000	Yeah, I don't know.
6126000	6127000	Oh my God, it's so funny.
6127000	6130000	And it's one of those laughs that you just think
6130000	6132000	you will never stop laughing at one point.
6132000	6138000	It's just beautiful because he's just got an over cane in his mouth.
6138000	6141000	And he's kind of like...
6141000	6142000	What do you think of the office?
6142000	6144000	What do you think of the UK office?
6144000	6145000	What do you think of the American office?
6145000	6148000	I find no offense to anyone working on it,
6148000	6150000	but I find the American one hard to watch
6150000	6154000	because I really love that first series of The Office.
6154000	6159000	And I just find it odd that it's exactly the same relationships.
6159000	6163000	And I know they moved off it later on, but I don't know.
6163000	6164000	I find it a little bit hard to watch.
6164000	6166000	But true, no fault of the show.
6166000	6167000	I know it's a good show.
6167000	6168000	Yeah, yeah.
6168000	6170000	But you thought the UK one was like...
6170000	6173000	Oh, I think that first series is mind-blowing.
6173000	6175000	You don't have Gervais's fatigue,
6175000	6177000	which I've been told is a thing in England.
6177000	6178000	No, no.
6178000	6179000	I'm kidding. I made that up.
6179000	6180000	We were really...
6181000	6183000	I used to know him,
6183000	6185000	and then he slagged off the IT crowd on his blog
6185000	6186000	and was like, oh, OK.
6186000	6187000	What?
6187000	6190000	Yeah, yeah. It's like, oh, I don't know when we fell out.
6190000	6193000	But apparently that's the thing that friends now do to each other.
6193000	6195000	What do you do?
6195000	6197000	I'm deadly curious about this.
6197000	6201000	How does Ricky Gervais make the time to articulate a slag on...
6201000	6204000	He said, we got nominated for an award,
6204000	6207000	and he said, best of a bad lot.
6208000	6209000	I don't even know what that is.
6209000	6211000	That's so British, I'm like...
6212000	6215000	Of these bad things, it's probably the best.
6215000	6216000	It was the least shitty.
6216000	6217000	It was the least shitty.
6217000	6219000	Oh, was he hosting?
6219000	6221000	No, no, no. He was just writing about it.
6221000	6222000	Oh.
6222000	6224000	He took time out of his name to be honest about it.
6224000	6225000	Fuck you, Gervais.
6226000	6227000	Graham, I'm going to go on record
6227000	6229000	saying I never liked Ricky Gervais.
6230000	6231000	Let's get him.
6233000	6234000	All right.
6234000	6239000	The bell tolls for us.
6239000	6242000	Graham, you don't know about this,
6242000	6244000	but this is the point in the show,
6244000	6248000	we try to crudely shoehorn in an ending to our unstructured show.
6248000	6249000	Okay.
6249000	6251000	So it gets a little awkward.
6251000	6254000	And then the first funny thing I hear, I play a loud musical thing too.
6255000	6257000	And then we get the fuck out of here.
6257000	6258000	Okay.
6258000	6259000	Shit, I don't know.
6259000	6260000	Dan, you want to...
6260000	6261000	Don't force it.
6261000	6262000	Don't force it.
6262000	6265000	Now we just take a couple breaths.
6274000	6276000	We're all going to die.
6278000	6279000	Shit.
6288000	6290000	This has embraced the sadness of the sun.
6291000	6302000	If you got everyone to sing, Dan and I have kind of a Christmas tradition
6302000	6306000	where one year we got together and we changed the lyrics to this song.
6306000	6308000	It goes like this, Graham.
6317000	6318000	It's an Irish song.
6320000	6322000	It's a perfect storm.
6322000	6327000	It sticks in balls and beers.
6330000	6331000	It's not enough.
6332000	6334000	They deserve better.
6335000	6336000	They deserve...
6336000	6338000	Is there an Irish Christmas tradition, Graham,
6338000	6341000	that you want to share with us as a...
6341000	6344000	We celebrate Bill O'Reilly leaving.
6346000	6349000	We celebrate Bill O'Reilly's family being driven out.
6351000	6352000	Is he from Ireland?
6352000	6353000	No, no.
6353000	6354000	Just by name.
6354000	6356000	His name just sounds too Irish.
6356000	6358000	No, he's Irish descent though.
6358000	6359000	Irish descent.
6359000	6362000	Is there a word in the street about Irish...
6362000	6363000	People hate Bill O'Reilly?
6363000	6365000	No, no, they don't know who he is.
6365000	6366000	They don't know who he is.
6366000	6368000	He does come back and do TV shows in Ireland
6368000	6371000	and pretend to be a normal human being.
6371000	6375000	They let him away with it because no one really watches TV.
6375000	6377000	No, sorry, people watch TV in Ireland.
6377000	6379000	Sorry, that's not what I meant.
6379000	6382000	This guy Flanagan who runs this venue here in LA,
6382000	6385000	he's very Irish and he's very LA,
6385000	6390000	and he was explaining to me that he said this...
6390000	6393000	Now, I'm submitting this to you.
6393000	6395000	I want to yes or no.
6395000	6398000	He said, the Irish in Ireland,
6398000	6401000	they actually, contrary to what you might think,
6401000	6411000	they're not repulsed by the millions of Irish-American tourists
6411000	6413000	that flood to the homeland every year.
6413000	6421000	They kind of like it because the actual Irish represent a certain amount
6421000	6424000	and the idea that seed was spread,
6424000	6427000	no matter how fat and gross these people are,
6427000	6431000	they come back and buy these key chains and refrigerator magnets.
6431000	6432000	I don't know.
6432000	6439000	In Dublin, you might not see it as much because people get to Dublin
6439000	6441000	and they're annoyed because there's a gap
6441000	6445000	and there's no Irish fiddlers on the street.
6445000	6447000	But you go out into the countryside...
6447000	6449000	Is nobody selling cockles and mussels?
6449000	6451000	No, you don't really get that anymore.
6451000	6454000	The cockles and mussels business is dried up.
6454000	6455000	It's just a shame.
6455000	6457000	Dublin, when I grew up in Dublin,
6457000	6460000	they used to annoy me any representation of Ireland
6460000	6463000	that involved fiddlers or people going,
6463000	6464000	Ho-ho!
6464000	6467000	LAUGHTER
6467000	6471000	I was in New York and Chicago celebrate St. Patrick's Day,
6471000	6473000	I think probably more than Ireland does.
6473000	6475000	No, believe me,
6475000	6479000	the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in New York
6479000	6482000	are the funniest thing to Irish people.
6482000	6485000	They are just so ridiculous
6485000	6492000	and these kind of awful men turning their back on the gay Irish coming by.
6492000	6493000	Oh, right.
6493000	6494000	All that sort of stuff.
6494000	6497000	There's a pub in Hell's Kitchen, I think,
6497000	6498000	and it's an Irish pub,
6498000	6501000	and they have this big sign that I was there once, St. Patrick's Day.
6501000	6505000	I wasn't there during it, but it was the day before or two days before.
6505000	6508000	And there was a big sign, like in big block letters that said,
6509000	6510000	Don't Sing Danny Boy.
6510000	6511000	It's not an Irish song.
6511000	6512000	It was written by an English person.
6512000	6513000	Really?
6513000	6516000	Like, if you fucking sing Danny Boy in here, we're throwing you out.
6516000	6518000	That sounds like a great bar.
6518000	6520000	That's where you want to go to.
6520000	6523000	But I heard a great story from a band called,
6523000	6525000	a Northern Irish band called Terrapie,
6525000	6528000	who were on tour with House of Pain.
6528000	6530000	Remember House of Pain Jump Around?
6530000	6532000	We could forget.
6532000	6533000	Yeah, but they were in...
6533000	6535000	House of Pain was Jump Around?
6535000	6536000	Yeah, wasn't it?
6537000	6538000	I didn't know that.
6538000	6541000	But House of Pain, they were in Dublin,
6541000	6543000	and Terrapie were in their dressing room,
6543000	6545000	and one of House of Pain stuck their head in and said,
6545000	6547000	Hey, guys, come with us.
6547000	6549000	We found this great Irish bar.
6551000	6552000	Fucking...
6552000	6553000	In Ireland?
6553000	6554000	Yeah, really?
6554000	6557000	But I think they meant a bar that had a shamrock in it or something.
6559000	6561000	Every other bar wasn't an Irish bar.
6561000	6563000	It probably had a Celtics jersey in there.
6564000	6566000	Shit, I was hoping that would be it.
6566000	6568000	This is where we start scrambling.
6568000	6570000	It's every man for himself right now.
6572000	6574000	But the answer is no.
6574000	6577000	I'm wondering what...
6577000	6582000	I'm not wondering what three intellectuals in London
6582000	6586000	having a drink at a bar say about American culture,
6586000	6590000	but I am very much wondering what three Irish...
6590000	6595000	I'll tell you, we used to love the regulars in our bar.
6595000	6599000	We used to go to this pub in Dublin called The International, me and Arthur.
6599000	6602000	And there were always some really funny guys there,
6602000	6605000	and they'd just be watching the TV.
6605000	6607000	They were there every day.
6607000	6610000	And 9-11 happened, you know?
6610000	6612000	And this guy was...
6612000	6613000	Here comes our closer.
6613000	6614000	We got our closer.
6614000	6615000	It's coming.
6615000	6617000	Buckle up, everybody.
6618000	6621000	If it doesn't have the power to close a show,
6621000	6624000	then I question its status as a national tragedy.
6626000	6628000	Can I say that on record?
6628000	6632000	Well, so basically, Bin Laden, you know,
6632000	6635000	his name was starting to be floated about because of it, you know?
6635000	6637000	And this guy was looking up at the TV,
6637000	6640000	and you see the towers burning, and then you see a picture of Bin Laden.
6640000	6642000	And this guy at the bar said,
6642000	6644000	there he is, the man of the moment.
6647000	6649000	That's Hammertown, everybody.
6649000	6651000	Thank you for coming.
6651000	6653000	Graham Linahan.
6653000	6655000	I have a drink.
6655000	6660000	He should be a guest in our country until he leaves.
6660000	6662000	He's a genius.
