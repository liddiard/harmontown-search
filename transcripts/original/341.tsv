110280	111280	Thank you.
111280	123440	I'm sorry, you discussed what you wanted at the beginning of the show and it totally left
123440	124440	my brain.
124440	125440	Yeah.
125440	126440	Look, I'm giving you space.
126440	128680	I'm sensitive to you.
128680	135240	Like I came into the green room and was like, hey Rob, I had an idea for tonight and he's
135240	137240	like, whatever you want, man.
137240	141640	I'm like, all right.
141640	142640	Just a pitch.
142640	143640	Like, you don't have to do it.
143640	145880	And he's like, whatever you want, man.
145880	150120	I was like, well do you want to double down on like the moderator practice thing?
150120	152000	You're going to be moderating the Comic Con panel.
152000	153000	You want to open it?
153000	157720	I'm going to be moderating the Rick and Morty Q&A.
157720	161640	You could introduce it as either the Harmon town panel or the practice Rick and Morty
161640	165520	panel and in either case, bring people out and say, yeah, whatever you want.
165520	166520	I'm like, all right.
166520	167520	What is going on?
167520	169640	And an intern came out and I didn't give you anything you want.
169640	170640	Yeah.
170640	171640	I mean, bad friend.
171640	172640	It's fine.
172640	173640	No, it's fine.
173640	174640	Bad friend.
174640	175640	That's what friends are for.
175640	176640	I don't care.
176640	177640	Shitty friend.
177640	181760	Like I said to you back there, I don't give a fuck if you like my idea or not.
181760	182760	I don't.
182760	183760	I liked your idea.
183760	186640	In fact, I was even thinking about that before.
186640	190400	And then you went off on the thing that had you in a bad mood and you kind of lost yourself
190400	193120	and you went into autopilot out here and that's fine.
193120	194680	I can do that too.
194680	195680	Here's my autopilot.
195680	198080	I just go to my little notes here.
198080	202200	Oh, bagel boss.
202200	204760	Who hasn't heard enough about that guy.
204760	205760	Let's talk about him.
205760	206760	Did you see that video?
206760	207760	That little guy?
207760	209840	I saw the video about that.
209840	210840	Here's the thing.
211840	213360	His name isn't bagel boss.
213360	216520	Oh, I thought he was the bagel boss.
216520	220080	He went to a place called bagel boss.
220080	222320	Am I saying bagel right?
222320	223320	I don't even know.
223320	224320	I wouldn't know.
224320	225320	Bagel.
225320	226320	Was I?
226320	227320	Bagel.
227320	228320	Bagel.
228320	229320	What did I say?
229320	230320	Bagel.
230320	231320	Something.
231320	232320	Right?
232320	235600	You did a whole season of television off of that, right?
235600	236880	Yeah, because I don't know.
236880	241200	I have to say the word bagel and then people will alternatively go, you still see like
241200	242200	that.
242200	244040	Or they'll go like, wait, why are you saying it right now?
244040	247560	I'm like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about unless I think about it.
247560	249160	I'm not going to think about the word bagel.
249160	250160	I'm tired of it.
250160	251160	Whatever.
251160	252160	Let's move on.
252160	253160	Yeah.
253160	254160	I mean, even worth.
254160	259760	I was worried that little bagel boss who's apparently not the boss, not the boss.
259760	264160	I was worried for five seconds that he was would kill himself because I think he's a
264160	265160	viral guy.
265160	268600	I think I heard that he's like one of these one of these viral guys.
268600	269600	Yeah, I know.
269600	271760	He's he's having a field day.
271760	276920	No, like like he's one of these people who stages things and is like, ah, so yeah.
276920	278520	So like he's done videos before.
278520	281400	I think he's like the nylons boss or something.
281400	282680	I'm sorry, Spencer.
282680	283680	I'm cutting you off.
283680	293640	But really don't who's got who's got the time, energy or want to do any little bagel guy.
293640	294640	Yeah.
294640	301160	So I look at that and I go and I go, OK, I understand that on paper, but the sheer
301160	307960	like get up in the morning and know I don't think the energy that he I mean, if you have
307960	311520	nothing else, I mean, if he could like weld things, I thought it was interesting because
311520	315520	he's like a part of his meme is that he was like when he yells at the guy, goes, you're
315520	318280	not God, my father.
318280	322280	And then he kind of like pauses for a second, goes, or my boss.
322280	323880	And I thought, why would you throw that in there?
324120	325640	I was like, oh, he's worried he's going to get fired.
325640	330680	Who is where does he work that that that crediting his boss right at the end there is
330680	331720	going to make the difference?
332880	334120	Spencer, I'm sorry.
334120	337520	I thought he just read the you know, the sign on the wall and it was like, oh, right.
337520	338960	Boss bagel boss.
338960	340280	Oh, right. OK.
340280	343440	Anyways, we don't have to talk about or my bagel little guy.
343920	349600	I'm just I'm just I'm at an age now in a kind of world weariness where I was like the worst
349600	354440	thing about that story was I was like, oh, this guy might kill himself.
354440	359000	Like this is too much like like I because the video just has him cutting out.
359000	363800	I did I I worried about him for five seconds until you get the rest of the story.
363800	365600	And it turns out like, you know, he's a pig and shit.
365600	369520	He loves it. He's like and then he's like, this is that was a big day for him.
369520	371760	You're looking at one of the most important days of his life.
372760	376800	You know, yeah, you guys hear about this gamer girl bathwater?
377120	380560	No, there's this gamer girl.
380560	383080	What's selling her bathwater?
383080	386320	I like that you said it like Jed Clampett from Beverly Hillbilly.
386720	390320	What's I love that. What's isn't that what's as a way?
390320	391040	What are we using?
391040	395280	What's as well? Who is sometimes that is what's yeah.
395600	398200	Yeah, she's she's sold two baths worth of water.
398200	399560	Now I understand.
399560	402400	How big are they like energy shot bottles?
403040	406720	A bit bigger, like a less than a pint of ice cream kind of size,
406720	409360	but about there like in a glass. She hot?
409640	412520	Oh, yeah. I mean, I shouldn't say that. She's probably young.
414560	416880	I don't think you're supposed to ask it or answer.
416880	418080	Well, I'm trying to.
418080	421080	OK, let me ask you a different question. Is he is she dirty?
424280	426160	I don't know.
426160	428600	Well, if she took a bath.
428600	431800	Is she how dirty is she?
431800	434320	Yeah, bathwater. Yeah. Yeah.
435120	437520	Well, that's that's that's terrific.
437520	439400	They'll sell anything.
439400	441000	They'll buy anything.
441000	443320	I bought I thank you for that segue.
443320	445000	I bought a fifteen hundred dollar pool.
445000	446680	Not my pitches. God damn it.
449240	451360	Not my pitches.
451360	452880	It's a pool robot, was it?
452880	454880	I bought one of those pool robots. It doesn't matter.
454880	456360	How big is it? How tall?
456360	458640	It's like a six feet tall dune buggy.
458640	460640	Like I've got the most expensive one.
460640	463240	I went to a pool supply store
463240	465800	and I think like pool supply store is like
465800	467480	they must exist in some kind of bubble
467480	470880	where like people are calling them all the time for like free pool advice.
470880	473600	I think like if it was a doctor's office, they'd just be like,
473600	474840	what's your insurance?
474840	476400	And people would hang up.
476400	479360	But a pool place you can just call and be like,
479960	482560	hey, how many buckets of water kill a spider?
482560	484680	You know, I think I just I got that impression
484680	487240	because the phone was just ringing off the hook the entire time I was there.
487240	489920	And the guy kept answering and he'd go, uh huh, uh huh.
490160	492560	Hey, I actually have a customer in the store right now.
492560	493400	So can I get back to you?
493400	496760	And I kept wanting to go, you don't have a I don't want anything from you.
496760	499520	I go, you can see a fucking net on a stick.
499520	500640	Like I don't need your help.
500640	502760	Like you can talk on the phone all you want.
503040	506160	I'm only here because I don't want to wait a day for the mail.
507200	511240	And I bought a net on a stick and a pool robot for the bees.
512000	513600	Yeah. A lot of insect.
513600	515640	You have a lot of bee problems.
515640	518600	There's a lot of bees in the pool. Bees in the pool.
518600	521840	Did you see I did a Austin power as a bee?
521840	523160	I saw that T-shirt. I liked it.
523160	526160	I pressed the heart button for you. Thank you.
526640	529160	Selling. It's really burning up the charts.
529760	533040	Over at Shrab home video on my T-shirt page.
534320	536760	Hey, OK, do you have any of these?
536760	539520	Yes. Polish moles, as they call them in Milwaukee.
539520	544600	Skintags, you know, I haven't had one in a really long time.
544600	547320	I don't want to fuck. It's disgusting.
547320	550360	You know what you do? Just rip it off.
551880	554480	Well, I wanted to ask you about it,
554480	556240	but obviously you're going to give joke answers.
556240	557440	You know, you do.
557440	559720	You get dental floss and you tie it up
560840	563480	and then it strangles it to death and it falls off.
563720	567760	But what about all the talk about the reason I have one dangling off of me
567760	571400	is because at some point in my life, like it entered my consciousness.
571400	574840	We're not supposed to fucking you're not supposed to touch them.
574840	575920	You're not supposed to mess with them.
575920	577960	Well, I think they do tend to grow back,
577960	579720	but I've read that about those things.
579720	581800	They do fall off. They do fall off on their own.
581800	584520	I had one of my collarbone once that grew and I was convinced
584520	587440	I had cancer for a week and then it just like fell off one day.
587760	591280	And then I but I've I've got this one on my arm.
591680	593040	It looks like a little Quato.
593040	594360	No, it's very old.
594360	597720	Like I'm just letting it I'm giving it crackers. I there's this.
598840	604720	There's this wart remover that you it it comes in like kind of like,
605280	609520	you know, like when you spray like air, air, air spray like canned air
609760	612400	and you turn it upside down and it feels cold.
612400	616000	And yeah, you used to run around my apartment pretending to fart.
617160	618920	You loved that the day you found that out.
618920	622360	If you held the can upside down, it would shoot visible like air out.
622360	624160	It's pretty cool. And you would like
624160	628240	you went through a case of canned air standing in doorways going
629840	633120	like shooting like white smoke. Does anybody have any canned air?
634120	635600	I don't think they understand.
635600	637640	Is there canned air in the building?
638480	641400	Can somebody go get?
641400	643800	I don't think I think they can visualize it if you hold it up.
643800	647680	So there's like this wart remover where you what it does is like
647680	650560	it's a little can of like whatever freezes it.
650880	652000	It's not a wart.
652000	655760	Well, but the thing is, is it'll freeze it and it'll fall off quicker.
655800	657080	OK, but I can just strangle it.
657080	660800	I can cut it off like I but I'm yeah, but that'll hurt it if you freeze it.
660800	661960	I'm not worried about the pain.
662120	664120	Then cut it off, then pull it off, then bite it off.
664120	665360	Then you don't know anything about this.
665360	668400	OK, so the reason I'm asking is because I hear it's like in my mind,
668400	671240	like people go like don't touch them, like don't fuck with them, right?
671240	674960	Anybody? Yeah, like like like it's been put in my head.
674960	676840	I don't know if this is true or not, but it's in my head.
676840	681840	The idea that if you if you remove, yeah, if you remove them, it could cause cancer.
687320	689720	I mean, their cancer minds.
689720	694720	Is it? I mean, I'm hoping you're not a doctor
694720	697360	because I don't want that to be totally true.
697360	700040	I don't I don't I don't.
700200	702440	But that's sort of what I I got.
702440	705960	The idea that what it is is that, well, those things are cells gone mad,
705960	707720	which is what cancer is.
707720	711400	But these things are contained, at least to like your East
711400	716080	European heritage in terms of like, I'll just put a bubble on this person's eyelid
716960	720640	like like just so they can get through this documentary about UFOs.
720640	723360	And think about this. Think about this. Think about this.
723520	727200	It's cancer that's trying to get out of your body. Right, exactly.
727200	730040	And so when you're going when you fuck with it, you're like actually
730360	733280	hacking the mainframe of a thing that's already on the edge.
733280	735600	It's like the Jack Nicholson of cells.
735920	739640	And you don't want to give it an excuse to do Witches of Eastwick. All right.
741360	745160	I riffed that like during the moment, I was kind of proud of it, but it's not like
746720	747880	it's not like, oh, Witches of Eastwick.
747880	750880	And I was as Ishtar, I don't know.
752800	754200	Thanks. Thanks.
755000	757000	Sometimes that's all we need.
757000	761400	What? Just like one guy at medium volume saying good.
761560	763840	I like that. Yeah, I do. Yeah, I like that.
763960	765120	That's good. It's good.
765120	768960	Like I and I I'm trying to I'm actually now thinking in my head,
768960	770720	does it need to be a guy? Could it be a woman?
770720	771920	Would it be different if it was a woman?
771920	775240	Like, like, because I know I mean, I listen to.
775240	779400	I think it was a it was a lady going, good boy. Yeah.
780920	782680	That would that would be OK.
782680	785240	That that that's a little bit of all right, right there.
785480	786360	I don't think it would work.
786360	791240	I think I would predict like, Robbie, you're the Freudian, like impulses.
791240	794600	And I would be like, no, you're lying. They all lie.
796480	801040	OK, too soon to to to common, to common.
801280	804120	Good. Not funny anymore to pretend to be misogynist.
804240	806840	But you can go down the street and get real misogyny anywhere.
806840	809000	Why is your fake misogyny funny? It's not.
809200	811440	Is there another show? Yeah.
814640	818680	Like it's Chuck E. Cheese going like, hey, hey, you like you like my dongle?
818800	821120	Look, what the fuck is that?
821120	822560	I got this thing on Amazon.
822560	826600	It's like it's backing up my my phone right now.
826600	830960	It's nineteen point three percent finished to what to it. Yeah. OK.
831000	832120	So it's like a flash drive.
832120	834280	And it's got look, it looks like a ninja star.
834280	839760	I don't know if that's racist to say now, but it just it has like it's a four.
840480	843800	It's a four prong thing like a like a cross kind of.
843800	848120	Yeah, it's got it's got a different it's got a micro USB,
848120	851680	a lightning, a USB C and a regular USB
852960	856600	respectively, as you go around the perimeter of the karate star.
856880	860840	And and it's it's plugged into my phone right now, which means that right after
860840	863280	I could pull this out and plug it into ostensibly
864800	865680	an Internet laptop.
865680	868200	Yeah, with even less storage than my phone.
870720	874200	Anyways, but once you start backing something up, I can I can't pull this out.
874360	875880	No, it's terrifying.
875880	879040	I don't know anything about the whole thing.
879720	881800	How many how many storages do you well?
881800	884440	How many gigs are in each device that's attached?
884440	887800	Well, I'm I'm I'm maybe coining this phrase,
887800	893600	but I'm what you call a snowball in in the Apple douchebag community.
893600	898400	And then I bought the first iPhone and have bought every successive iPhone
898600	901280	and have basically only ever transferred
901520	905560	all of my information from my first iPhone to this iPhone.
905760	910200	I'm seven iPhones in and they keep expanding the storage.
910200	916240	So I have never like ever dumped my phone's contents out anywhere
916720	917680	for safekeeping.
917680	919120	So you're dodging the question.
919120	922720	Wait, sorry, what I how many how many storages do you have on it?
923040	924880	How many how many gigs is it backing up?
924880	926720	How many gigs can that device back?
926720	929120	I think this thing is smaller than my phone.
929120	930560	That's what I was guessing.
930560	934160	Yeah. But I'm hoping that maybe that.
935080	937800	Just the photos, just the photo roll.
937800	939080	Oh, if you could do that, that's cool.
939080	941280	Go on here. Yeah, yeah.
941280	943040	Yeah, I mean, we don't want to.
943040	945640	I do. I got two hours, baby.
945640	949400	I mean, we don't have to talk about anything, really.
949560	951560	I we could meditate.
951800	953840	Yeah, I'm pretty much done.
953840	957000	I've been I've been dinging the Golden Girls with with Cody,
958080	960840	which I know is like a kind of a hipster thing.
960880	963280	Like you're supposed to, you know, like, oh, yeah, girls.
963280	969040	But but like as a sitcom writer of advancing age
970240	972720	with a girlfriend who like would watch it with her parents,
972720	975320	I think when she was a kid or something, it was nostalgic value
975320	976560	for her, but we all started watching it.
976560	979320	It was like, you know, it's like hate watching it first,
979320	980680	kind of like he's old.
980680	983960	Like who gives a shit fucking Golden Girls, Golden Girls,
985480	988520	Golden Girls, three or four episodes into the first season.
988520	991560	You're kind of like, I mean, there's something special happening here.
991560	995160	It is I want to be very clear because we're you know,
995200	998840	we live in a culture where it's too it's too convenient for people
998840	1000280	to be like, this is genius.
1000280	1002520	And, you know, like, I don't know.
1002520	1005960	I mean, look, television is a derivative medium.
1006120	1009080	The multicam sitcom is the worst of the worst.
1009680	1014960	But it's as far as like what, you know, on some spectrum of like,
1015680	1019560	I don't know, fucking coolness, you know, you're dealing in drivel.
1019880	1023800	But like at the same time, you have to recognize that there's a craft there.
1023800	1027360	Like you you know, when you've watched a shitty multicam sitcom
1027360	1031800	versus a good one and and then and then there.
1031800	1035360	But then there's not just that one dial because I'm watching Golden Girls.
1035360	1036480	I'm like, I would never.
1036480	1039240	I don't think I would stick with this for multiple episodes.
1039240	1043800	But I'm so old now that I was starting to like dial into this thing of like,
1044120	1045760	geez, this thing is kind of genius.
1045760	1050080	Just and it's I think like all I can do is it feels like a solar
1050080	1054280	powered moped or something like it's I was just like, this show must be
1054280	1057760	so fucking cheap like they never leave their house.
1057960	1060880	And they just keep talking about the same shit.
1060880	1064240	Like one of them might get married and the other three are freaking out about it.
1064480	1069000	And like, but it's like it just starts to like take on this like very
1069000	1072960	you're like, holy shit, in terms of like the amount of energy going in
1073200	1074880	versus the amount of energy coming out.
1074880	1080000	This thing is actually like a like a some miracle of sitcom technology
1080000	1082160	like a like a Dyson sphere.
1082160	1084920	But like with it, it's just like, how is this so?
1085120	1090520	And it really does earn all of that, like kind of a, you know, hipster kind of like
1090680	1092960	well, it's pretty it is pretty progressive.
1092960	1094720	I mean, it's like all female cast.
1094720	1097280	Plus, they're all older.
1097280	1100520	They're not fuckable, which is pretty amazing.
1100920	1102840	You guys really you're like, oh,
1104520	1108400	you know, I mean, like when I wouldn't put it that harshly.
1108400	1109560	What if one of them is listening?
1109560	1111760	Was that what that was?
1111760	1114440	They knew going into it that that's what I mean.
1114440	1118480	The only time seriously, the only time something like that will ever happen again
1118480	1123240	is if they reboot Golden Girls, like they'll nobody's going to go.
1123240	1124760	Let's get a bunch of.
1124760	1127200	We want the next Golden Girls or whatever.
1127200	1130720	I mean, was designing women on the same network or was it?
1130720	1132280	I feel like designing women was NBC.
1132280	1134880	I don't know. What was what was Golden Girls?
1135960	1136920	Well, I have no idea.
1136920	1139760	I don't really see the Tarantino episode of Golden Girls.
1139760	1140960	No, I haven't seen that yet.
1140960	1143960	He didn't write or direct it, if that's what you're hoping.
1143960	1146520	But there is that you get through the first season and you can tell
1146520	1148960	there's something magical about you watch a first season of a show
1148960	1154360	and you can kind of see, like, like, oh, they're operating in total darkness.
1154600	1159280	Like, like they're on a soundstage somewhere and they they have no idea.
1159280	1163480	You know, like, like, like they don't know they're going to be syndicated.
1163480	1166200	They don't know there's probably who knows how these shows, you know,
1166200	1168600	they might have banked twenty five episodes before they aired a single one.
1168600	1170120	I have no idea what the history of that show is.
1170120	1175760	But, you know, it's just a almost criminal simplicity to the first season.
1176000	1178320	And we just went through all twenty five episodes.
1178480	1181000	And it was kind of like it was very interested, too, in this idea of like,
1181000	1184520	obviously, that note of schmuck bait, what didn't exist back then,
1184760	1187320	because Golden Girls is like season one is like
1187800	1190720	if you were ever going to get the note of schmuck bait
1191160	1195400	from what do you mean? Schmuck bait is when is is just like
1196160	1199400	in broadcast sitcoms, it would be like a note you'd get
1200640	1205440	that where like you can't expect the audience to believe their stakes here.
1205760	1210200	So like, like, oh, Barney Miller is going to retire in like an episode
1210200	1213920	17 of Barney Miller, where like, why would the show get in?
1213960	1215200	Yeah, it's like schmuck bait.
1215200	1217320	Like, we know that's not going to happen.
1217320	1220520	So don't. So like, oh, this is like you.
1220520	1222720	Do you think the audience is a schmuck?
1222720	1227160	Like, why would you be pretending that this is allowable as a story?
1227560	1229720	Oh, shit.
1229720	1234160	Cattle one.
1235920	1236600	The breakfast.
1236600	1237920	Thank you, guys, son.
1237920	1240960	God, this place is so fancy.
1241960	1244440	I didn't know he was here.
1244440	1247320	Cattle one audience zero.
1247920	1249800	Yeah, that was Jeff Davis.
1249800	1253000	For those of you who have Davis came in with a bucket of ice.
1253000	1256440	He presented the kettle one and Dan sat down.
1256440	1258000	You never got the schmuck bait note.
1258800	1260360	You got it when we were writing together.
1260360	1261880	We've gotten a schmuck bait note.
1261880	1262800	Whatever.
1262800	1265360	It kind of goes hand in hand with the should I stay or should I go,
1265360	1268640	which is like that's that's like a category of schmuck bait,
1269000	1273640	where if you're writing a pilot, like you can't you can't spend your pilot
1274000	1278120	having the protagonist go, I don't know, should I be here or not?
1278120	1280200	Like, maybe I shouldn't be here.
1280200	1286400	It's like, hey, schmuck, like they're obviously their face is on the poster
1286400	1288880	and in all the commercials, like we know that Diane's going to keep working
1288880	1290480	at Cheers. Stop it.
1290480	1292400	But but she stopped.
1292400	1293880	They did it back then.
1293880	1294840	They got away with it.
1294840	1298840	And it's kind of it's kind of it's fun to look at and go like,
1298840	1301080	God, damn, they didn't have that note to contend with.
1301080	1305040	So they were able to tell like simpler stories
1305040	1307520	where it was just like every fucking week, one of the golden girls
1307520	1309800	was worried that one of the other golden girls was going to move out.
1309920	1312400	And it was like, come on, that's the one thing we know can't happen.
1312880	1316000	But anyways, but the thing I wanted to talk about
1316400	1320240	was, yeah, I was hoping this was out, Jeff Davis just walked out.
1322520	1327040	I hope he just keeps bringing things, making the the ice bucket.
1327160	1328720	Yeah, presentable.
1328720	1331320	What could come next?
1331320	1333320	Thank you very much, Jeff, just left.
1333320	1336400	If you're an aficionado,
1336400	1339400	if you're like an aspiring TV writer or something like that,
1339400	1340800	I don't recommend this for everybody.
1340800	1342280	I'm not a foodie of television.
1342280	1344520	I'm not like, oh, learn to swim one, one.
1344680	1347280	But I think if you're an aspiring like sitcom writer,
1347280	1349520	if that is, if that craft is going to stick around, but whatever.
1349520	1350520	I think it's very interesting to watch.
1350520	1351240	Learn to wash dishes.
1351240	1355560	Season season two, episode one of The Golden Girls.
1355960	1356960	Very interesting.
1356960	1359200	Learn to paint.
1359200	1361120	Obviously, they took a break.
1361120	1365040	Obviously, then the reviews were probably like, holy shit,
1365040	1366480	these guys are great together.
1366480	1368920	There's something really amazing about this show.
1368920	1371040	It's working really well. We love it. We love it.
1371200	1374160	It probably wasn't like bet heavily on
1374320	1376200	the budget was low, probably.
1376840	1379080	And then it was like explosively popular.
1379080	1381480	And then like one can only imagine
1382920	1385080	who knows, you could speculate forever.
1385400	1388320	And then like so that season two starts with episode one.
1388320	1388920	And it's like.
1390200	1393920	They're in a in a new set that you've never seen before.
1393920	1396320	All of a sudden, you're in the Golden Girls garage,
1396720	1398960	which you've never seen before.
1398960	1402200	Two of them are building mink cages.
1402200	1406440	And this is a show that was like if you if you are a fan,
1406440	1408840	if you've been into it, you know like how just like kind of
1408840	1410160	provincial it was.
1410160	1412080	It was like they just went back and forth from the living room
1412080	1414440	to the kitchen in a cheesecake and talked about the two stories.
1414480	1418760	Yeah, bottle of water bottle of Arrowhead.
1418760	1421880	Tonight's show is sponsored by Arrowhead Water.
1422320	1426200	Arrowhead Water, when you need a refreshing Arrowhead.
1426880	1429000	Jeff Davis, Jeff Davis.
1429000	1430800	So season two starts and they're like Davis.
1430920	1435080	They're like, oh, God, we're never going to finish these mink cages on time
1435080	1437880	and started going to the who thought of going into the mink business?
1437880	1441920	And it's like like it's not even the same in an episode about going into the mink.
1441920	1444360	They've gone into the mink business.
1444560	1445360	That's the crazy thing.
1445360	1448520	It's not an episode about them deciding to go into it.
1448680	1450640	They're going to sell mink.
1450640	1453760	I think it turns out to have packing nothing to do.
1453760	1456840	It's like a runner in the episode so that in the end they can go, look,
1456840	1458320	the minks are fucking.
1458320	1461800	It was it was it was about Rue McClanahan's menopause.
1461800	1465160	The episode was so fucking like out of control.
1465400	1468360	And if you're if you're if anybody that worked on The Golden Girls,
1468360	1471520	like I'm confident that if you're proud of that episode,
1471520	1474080	you're not the kind of person that I'm worried about offending.
1474080	1477520	But like I like because I think that anybody that worked on that show
1477880	1482080	would they have to there has to be a story behind anybody,
1482120	1488280	anybody that can write a show about a bunch of people hanging out.
1488720	1493120	In a living room and is able to get past page one
1493280	1495040	is a fucking hero to me.
1495040	1498360	They keep cranking the because I'm like, what I keep.
1498800	1500320	I mean, you could do it.
1500320	1502520	I'd be like, where do I go?
1502520	1504040	Somebody's going to have to.
1504040	1506200	I mean, yeah, it sucks.
1506200	1509600	It's it's it sucks even if you can cheat by like having your show
1509600	1513320	be about a dude that burps and says like, we got to go get all the diarrhea
1513320	1516320	and then someone goes like, oh, geez, I don't know if we should do that.
1516320	1518280	And you're like halfway through a page.
1518600	1519960	Like that's cheating.
1519960	1523240	I mean, the the I the Golden Girls writers can't do that.
1523240	1524200	I don't think that's cheating.
1524200	1525560	I can't do that.
1525560	1527800	You could try. I have.
1527800	1528680	You did a good job.
1528680	1530760	You did your first beat sheet and record wording.
1530760	1533320	That was your beat sheet, wasn't it?
1533320	1535560	That was a good man. I had some help.
1535560	1538400	I mean, like, well, yeah, that's TV writing.
1538440	1540120	You have some help.
1540120	1542360	OK, we work as a team.
1542360	1545880	All right. Why don't you practice bringing out people for ladies and gentlemen?
1546520	1552600	Put your hands and feet together for our next guest,
1552600	1556520	Jefferson Davis, bringing camera tonight.
1558480	1561080	Jefferson Davis.
1561080	1563640	Oh, shit. Jefferson Davis.
1563640	1565560	Oh, shit. Jefferson Davis.
1565560	1568240	Casual. Oh, shit. Casual.
1568240	1570480	Jefferson Davis.
1570480	1571840	Yes. Oh, shit.
1571840	1573640	Mayor Jefferson Davis.
1573640	1576040	Oh, shit. Rolling up the sleeves.
1576040	1578520	Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
1578520	1581240	Oh, shit. Yeah.
1581240	1583520	Oh, shit. Thank you very much.
1583520	1585360	Oh, shit. Yeah.
1585360	1587000	Wicked, wicked. Oh, shit.
1587000	1590680	Jeff just put his jacket around the arrowhead water bottle
1590680	1593360	and walked the fuck off the stage.
1594520	1597040	Yeah, I mean, I got bad news.
1597640	1601160	Like, dude, how do you if everybody keeps phoning it in?
1601160	1602760	There's not very much of a show.
1602760	1605320	Why? Why? Why keep going on, man?
1605640	1610120	I mean, fuck it with life, with anything.
1610120	1612720	I mean, like so. Yes.
1615520	1616760	Sick of it. I agree.
1616760	1619320	Oh, come on. You had a creative.
1619320	1624640	I've been having a creative dot dot dot for the past 20 years, dude.
1624880	1627520	Don't even go there.
1627520	1630960	Well, yeah, but you were like everybody
1631600	1634240	that knows of you knows that you're
1635280	1637120	you came out smelling like a rose.
1637120	1640960	You like people know that you're a genius and that you do.
1640960	1642200	I don't want to hear. I don't want that.
1642200	1644520	I don't know. You're not fishing for it.
1644520	1647840	But I'm just say I'm not trying to like pump you up.
1647840	1650320	I'm just looking at it as a logician and going like,
1650680	1652240	what do you I mean?
1652240	1655480	Like, what do you want to star on the walk of fame like Donald Trump?
1655520	1657760	No, no, I don't want anything.
1657760	1661640	But I want I want a reason to get up in the morning
1661640	1666080	because people are out there need the there's like like like thousands
1666080	1669600	and thousands of people that never even bother to send an emoji
1670280	1675200	because they're that most people don't like they they see something
1675200	1679160	for 30 seconds that you make or a minute or five minutes or 20 minutes
1679160	1681360	or 100 episodes or 20 episodes or
1682960	1686840	like like overhearing in a fucking restaurant where you're being funny.
1687000	1688960	And oh, shit.
1691240	1693600	I like it. You put a lampshade on it.
1693600	1696800	And I bet you even thought it would hit Davis. Yes.
1699120	1701040	And it makes people happy.
1701040	1704200	You take in carbon dioxide and you put out oxygen
1704720	1707240	in a world that usually does the opposite.
1707240	1708920	And you sleep like a baby.
1708920	1711000	You go like, I don't have to care about all this other shit.
1712160	1713640	I drink poison.
1713640	1716400	I put out purified air.
1716840	1719640	Like it's a good gig.
1721280	1723440	You don't have to lift any boxes.
1723440	1724480	I'm not high roading you.
1724480	1728600	I'm just saying like, you know, yeah, I just it's I'm tired.
1728880	1729720	I'm tired of it.
1729720	1734440	I want you to tell me specifically that I need I need you
1735400	1737240	as your therapist.
1737240	1739760	I need you to name your
1741200	1742760	your goal like your thing.
1742760	1744640	I don't know anymore. I don't know. Right.
1744640	1746200	Well, I really don't know.
1746200	1747760	Well, that's a ticket to depression.
1747760	1749480	And I mean, that's I don't know.
1749480	1750840	I mean, I thought I did.
1750840	1753920	And, you know, but it just seems
1755200	1758040	then I mean, then all I would say is then it's like
1758320	1760800	sometimes we go through those phases where we don't know what we want.
1760880	1764160	And those are those are the you know, the grass is always greener.
1764160	1766320	But there's a lot of people who know what they want,
1766320	1768960	who when they look at people who don't know what they want are like,
1769240	1772840	must be nice, like, because they like,
1773520	1777360	they know for sure that all they have to do before they can fucking relax
1777360	1781520	is get these MRI results or like finish this internship
1781520	1785280	or turn in this theme paper or whatever the fuck poor people do.
1785520	1789880	The and they they have that they're locked in that maze.
1789880	1793960	And all they can look forward to is like this for like for a lot of Americans.
1793960	1795440	It's the myth of retirement for.
1795440	1797440	But we're all doing it to ourselves every day.
1797440	1800360	We're like, I just got to get this.
1800480	1804160	And then we're going to find out who Regarding Henry really is.
1804160	1806440	You know, like what kind of rich crackers am I into?
1806720	1808840	Lately, it's a good movie. You should check it out.
1809040	1812200	It is the the the so.
1812200	1814800	So you're in a place
1814800	1818720	when you're feeling like this, where you get to now just fucking.
1820040	1822160	I mean, the thing that you're depressed about is.
1825080	1825880	It's bad.
1825880	1828960	You should be depressed about being better about that,
1829160	1832040	because that makes you a loser.
1832040	1833040	I heard about it.
1833040	1835480	And I was like, what a loser.
1835480	1837120	Why is he depressed about that?
1837120	1838200	I appreciate that.
1838200	1839160	And I understand that.
1839160	1841400	But it's it's a symptom of a greater thing.
1841400	1843840	If you're my therapist, you know that already.
1843840	1844920	Yeah, come on.
1844920	1847680	I thought I thought I'm talking about the greater thing.
1848120	1850680	Yeah. And so I'm like, yeah, like, I think you're in a good.
1852080	1852760	You should.
1852760	1854160	Well, I'm not saying you should be happy.
1854160	1856800	Oh, shit. What could happen?
1856800	1858600	What could happen?
1858600	1861240	A tie could go on the lampshade.
1861240	1861880	Oh, wait a minute.
1861880	1864200	The lampshade. The lampshade is the neck.
1866200	1868560	What what head could come next?
1868560	1870400	I don't I don't think he can do it.
1870400	1871640	I don't think there's a head.
1871640	1874400	Oh, but I shudder to wait.
1874400	1877400	I don't think the head can fit on top of that.
1877880	1881000	You hear that, Jeff? That's a challenge.
1881000	1885720	Man, also like the lampshade could go upside down, but then the tie wouldn't fit.
1885840	1889120	Why would you put the lampshade upside down?
1889120	1890280	It would be easier.
1890280	1892800	I know it would fit easier over the top of the bottle.
1893080	1895440	Really? Oh, yeah, I could demonstrate.
1895440	1896520	But why would I do that?
1896520	1899520	Well, it's looking like it's working right now.
1899520	1902360	I know. I'm not I'm not trying to everybody listening at home.
1902360	1903000	I like the idea.
1903000	1904400	Well, there's what there's.
1904400	1907840	Yeah, but let's not talk about anything other than Jeff's bit
1907840	1910360	until Jeff comes out again.
1910360	1911400	That'll be good. Go.
1911400	1914080	Because so that he's not taking focus from anything.
1914680	1917600	He has to slowly eat himself.
1917600	1918960	I think that's happening.
1918960	1921240	Yeah, that's why I'm not eager to move on.
1921240	1923960	I don't know. We should ask Jeff.
1923960	1925640	He's got shoes.
1925640	1927400	OK, he's now he's putting shoes out.
1927400	1929960	And they're at the foot of the chair.
1929960	1931880	What kind of golem are you making?
1934360	1937400	You guys know about this golem, the Jewish golem?
1938400	1940280	You put like a slip of paper in its mouth.
1940280	1943160	The thing it says, you say, you know about the golem.
1943400	1944760	Oh, Levy knows all about it.
1944760	1947120	Levy. Hey, Levy, you're Jewish.
1947120	1950160	Tell me about the golem.
1950160	1952160	Is that like your Santa Claus? Come on.
1954320	1955320	Yeah, that's true.
1955320	1957960	Golem. Golem is made out of clay.
1957960	1958640	Made out of clay.
1958640	1960400	It's basically the first robot.
1960400	1961600	Yeah. Right.
1961600	1962200	It's a Jewish robot.
1962200	1964280	Made out of clay. It's a clay robot.
1964280	1967240	And it's infused with doo magic and it hunts down.
1967240	1968400	Alchemy.
1968400	1970280	I think you have to say the whole word.
1970280	1971280	Jew magic.
1974800	1975600	I think you got it.
1975600	1976720	I think you can't.
1976720	1978000	I think the key is.
1978000	1979720	Yeah, you're going to add the ish if you're.
1979720	1980400	Magi.
1980400	1982200	Otherwise, magi.
1982200	1983920	When you're using it as a descriptor,
1983920	1986240	you can't just stop at the Jew.
1986240	1989480	Like, you can't be like, I got in one of those Jew limousines.
1990600	1992080	Jewish, though, it's fine.
1992080	1993640	This is based on fact.
1993640	1996040	A golem is made out of Jew magic.
1996040	1996800	You can't know.
1996800	1998840	I mean, I'm just I'm just telling you linguistically.
1998840	1999480	Your magic.
1999480	2002040	What I've come to find, I think, is like the, you know,
2002040	2003680	like it's a it's a nuanced thing.
2003680	2006680	I should be saying Jewish or Hebrew magic.
2006680	2008560	I would. Yeah, this is great.
2008560	2011560	This is a clay made robot
2011560	2015520	infused with Hebrew magic.
2015520	2016440	Thank you.
2016440	2021440	Brought to life via the Hebrew faith.
2022280	2023920	You did a really funny thing the other day
2023920	2025800	when I left your house.
2025800	2027440	Side. Oh, yeah, that was fun.
2027440	2028440	I leave the house.
2028440	2030240	No, I don't.
2030240	2031240	You don't want me to do it?
2031240	2032880	Well, come on.
2032880	2034720	I got it. Come on.
2034720	2036040	OK, I won't do it. I want to do it.
2036040	2037320	I'm scared to do it.
2037320	2039320	OK, I'm scared. Yeah, no, no, no.
2039320	2040240	It's I'm sorry.
2040240	2042360	Like, we've entered a time when we can't.
2042360	2043640	OK, I won't do it. I won't do it.
2043640	2045800	OK, I'll tell you after the show.
2047280	2049680	It was just a bit for Shramana to say.
2051200	2054000	OK, so it's a golem is a.
2054000	2057360	All right, I'll tell you. OK, OK, you know, it's OK.
2057920	2060880	But you let me tell it so that I can protect myself
2060880	2061920	a little bit in my own mind.
2061920	2064160	It's just locker room humor.
2064160	2066080	It was it was it was it was this.
2066080	2066960	Give him up.
2066960	2071680	There was this delightful little boy who was like scooting past Rob's car
2071680	2076960	on this like crazy contraption that like it has like this like like 90 wheels
2076960	2079440	and like a big boomerang handlebar or something.
2079440	2083560	And he was like a very well-dressed boy with like it was Saturday.
2083560	2085800	It might have been what do you call it?
2085800	2090800	Shabbat or something. He had a Yama Khan and and he he was writing
2090800	2092160	on this crazy contraption.
2092160	2095920	And Shrab said as the little boy rode by, it's like, hey, what do you call that thing?
2096160	2098800	And the kid was like a yinger flanger or whatever.
2098840	2100480	The thing is called the brand name.
2100480	2102880	And Shrab's like, maybe you should get one of those to me.
2102880	2105480	And I'm like, why are you doing this to me and just leave?
2105480	2107800	And then and then I went back inside and I just did.
2107920	2110280	I knew the timing of it because Rob would be like on the freeway
2110280	2113040	by the time I texted and I was just like, I thought they were called Yama because
2113040	2117760	they just said, which would have been awesome if you said to the kid,
2117760	2119200	like, what is those things called?
2119200	2120720	And he was like a yinger flanger.
2120720	2123680	And it was like he said that as if they were talking about his hat.
2126760	2128480	I just thought the timing of it would be funny
2128480	2131520	because because it would be like a big long pause.
2131520	2133240	OK, is this a good bit?
2133240	2135120	OK, I've got a bit for you.
2135120	2138320	OK, tell me and maybe we can workshop this.
2139160	2141800	Hopefully it'll be better than the show fun thing from last week.
2141800	2144560	But OK, this is an announcer
2145280	2149000	who does inappropriate pronunciations.
2149200	2150640	OK, all right.
2155600	2160120	Coming this Easter Sunday, ABC proudly presents
2160600	2163720	the life and times of Jesus Christ.
2163720	2164560	It's
2170840	2173200	starring Willem Dafoe as Pontius Pilate,
2174720	2176600	Catherine Deneuve as Mary Magdalene.
2176600	2177200	Yeah.
2177200	2181480	And John Rills back as Jesus Christ.
2183760	2184840	It's nice, simple.
2184840	2185800	There's something in there.
2185800	2189920	I call that like 24 karat dad humor, like good dad humor.
2190360	2191680	Like dads are funny sometimes.
2191680	2194920	I call it really cool, sexy, I'm not bald humor.
2197320	2197960	What is it?
2197960	2200400	I mean, like this has happened in the last five years,
2200400	2201600	and I guess it's because I'm older.
2201600	2204120	Everything I'm doing is dad humor.
2204120	2205200	That's what Cody said.
2205200	2206040	I'm embracing it.
2206040	2210480	I mean, I truly honestly, I think it just means I'm on the way out.
2210480	2212040	Well, I don't have any kids.
2212040	2213680	No, no, no, that's not true at all.
2213680	2215560	I think dad humor is coming true.
2215560	2216760	I mean, you're not getting younger.
2216760	2220360	It's not our job after the age of 40.
2220360	2221440	It's not our job.
2221440	2226480	Oh, he put a drinking cup.
2226480	2229080	Oh, boy, we're going to make it work.
2229080	2232080	Oh, we'll make it work.
2232080	2233840	As I was saying, you're getting older.
2233840	2236680	We have to we have to ignore him.
2236680	2241840	It's not it's not our job after the age of 40 to be as to compete
2241840	2244880	with 25 year olds in terms of like, they're going to like, like, why?
2244880	2249960	Yes, like, let them like understand what Tinder is, let alone
2249960	2253240	what a funny or hack joke is about Tinder.
2253240	2256240	Like, we're not going to compete with that.
2256240	2260120	But that's not the same as being like out of business.
2260120	2266400	Like, you as you lose your your real time edge,
2266400	2268160	you gain all this other shit.
2268160	2270240	Like, you're like did it, folks.
2270240	2272520	You you want.
2272520	2277800	And one of the chief things you gain is fucking calm confidence.
2277800	2281600	Because because because because charismatic 25 year olds are ones
2281600	2285040	that that that create the impression that they give zero fucks.
2285040	2288800	And when you're 45, you can you you have an opportunity
2288800	2290280	to actually give zero fucks.
2290280	2295720	And and that can be helpful to a younger generation, too.
2295720	2298080	You know, so like, I like the dad joke.
2298080	2301680	I mean, yeah, I'm like, I'm like, I like say the most dumbest things.
2301680	2302600	I'm just like giddy.
2302600	2305400	Like, I just like smelling my own farts like Cody will say something.
2305400	2309080	And then I'll like make the dumbest shrabby joke.
2309080	2310080	Oof.
2310080	2311320	Got to hurt.
2311320	2315640	Well, you know, I kind of it doesn't hurt because I go out of my way.
2315640	2319560	It's got a dumb is and I think it's interesting because I don't think
2319560	2322200	I don't think dad jokes come as a result of having a kid.
2322200	2324880	I think dad jokes come as a result of being a certain age.
2324880	2329160	I think you're like Gandalf of the white comedically, which means that you just
2329160	2333120	like I don't even have to be that intense about fighting a ball rock anymore.
2333120	2335040	I can just be like, I'm here again.
2335040	2342560	Well, while you were having an adventure, I went and talked to the devil.
2342560	2343840	We made an agreement.
2343840	2345840	I don't really give a fuck.
2345840	2348120	I got my own franchise off to the side.
2348120	2350240	No one ever watches.
2350240	2353440	Who knows what's under this robe?
2353440	2356720	Does my dick have a big white beard?
2356720	2362000	Did you know wizards aren't even the same race as man in the Tolkien verse?
2362000	2362920	It's weird.
2362920	2364040	They're like angels.
2364040	2365480	Do you know that strong?
2365480	2367480	No, I never got past the Hobbit.
2367480	2370440	Yeah, it's true.
2370440	2371760	Why?
2371760	2374680	You know, when he fought ball rock, that was like a big deal.
2374680	2377880	After after he fell down, shit was still happening down there.
2377880	2383280	Is his name Ball Rock or is he a ball rock?
2383280	2385000	I think he's the ball rock.
2385000	2387480	I think there might be multiple ball rocks.
2387480	2390200	Then someone said two people said yes.
2390200	2391200	To what?
2391200	2393200	To there being multiple ball rocks.
2393280	2394440	Like he's a bad angel.
2394440	2396400	So he's a race of ball rock.
2396400	2399560	Well, I think I think they're like I can't remember the name of them,
2399560	2400760	but they're like spirits.
2400760	2403880	They're like angels of the good God or whatever the fuck.
2403880	2408840	And then the ball rocks are like angels of the bad God who is not Sauron, right?
2408840	2412320	He's like, Oh, here we go.
2412320	2415080	Yeah, don't punish him.
2415080	2416800	He's he's being helpful.
2416800	2420000	And what could come after the the drinking cap?
2420000	2422120	Excuse me, there is more than one ring.
2422120	2425760	Each one of the don't let him bully you.
2425760	2427960	Whoever I welcome to your I don't like.
2427960	2432120	Yeah, I wanted the rings to like, oh, one like, you know, makes you float or something.
2432120	2434160	You know, that would have been fucking cool.
2434160	2437040	I'll never understand what the fuck was so powerful about that ring.
2437040	2438120	I mean, it ruled the ball.
2438120	2441800	It's powerful to be invisible, but it makes you puke and turn into a Dracula.
2441800	2444240	It lets you control ring rates.
2444240	2446160	It's not real standard invisibility.
2446160	2447840	It's like fun for like 10 minutes.
2447840	2450360	And then you're like, I love fangs.
2450360	2452840	It like takes you to the ethereal plane or something.
2452840	2455440	Like, that's what you could then call it that.
2455440	2458360	Where the fuck where the fuck were all the other rings of time?
2458360	2460360	I mean, I'm sorry, I'm stealing the gallery.
2460360	2461960	No, no, you're supporting me.
2461960	2462800	Fine.
2462800	2463880	I'm like, wait, wait.
2463880	2465120	One rule of them all.
2465120	2467560	We're not like rings.
2467560	2471320	All the ring rates are which do nothing other than a door in your hand.
2471320	2475440	They make them into specters under control of the Sauron guy.
2475440	2478360	But not invisible.
2478360	2479840	Maybe they used to know.
2479840	2481160	I don't think they make you invisible.
2481160	2484040	I think they were just they just they just they're on your hand.
2484040	2485440	Because like the elves made their own.
2485440	2485760	Right.
2485760	2486800	And those are just fine.
2486800	2487560	They're like fine.
2487560	2493520	But then he copied the rings and was like, here, take all these, you kings.
2493520	2502840	Here's something you can do after 40 that you can't do before 40 fall asleep.
2502840	2504960	If you don't want to do something, you can text people.
2504960	2506160	Something came up.
2506160	2509240	I've been using that lately.
2509240	2511320	And people don't want to push after you're 40.
2511320	2513080	Like, I'll wait a minute.
2513080	2514080	Like I said, to leave you.
2514080	2516600	Wait, remember when I didn't come to work on Friday?
2516600	2519200	Something came up and came up.
2519200	2520640	Yeah, I'll tell you what came up.
2520640	2522680	Fucking laziness.
2522680	2524920	I went to the drawing room and fucking hung out.
2524920	2526640	Steve thought that was happening.
2526640	2528640	Yeah, I mean, I didn't make a big secret out of it.
2528640	2530000	You don't come to work.
2530000	2532880	There's you don't have to say something came up.
2532880	2533840	We just go.
2533840	2535640	He didn't want to come to work today.
2535640	2537120	It's your show.
2537120	2538120	It's your show.
2538120	2539760	The boss didn't want to come to work today.
2539760	2541000	It's something came up.
2541000	2542440	Something came up.
2542440	2544000	You can use that, too, though.
2544000	2546160	No, I look.
2546160	2548280	This is all I got, man.
2548280	2550840	You can tell me something came up and not show up.
2553120	2556360	But I can't do that.
2556360	2557440	I'm not going to fire you.
2557440	2558440	No, I don't.
2558440	2560160	But that's not me.
2560160	2561880	I'm not taking advantage of that.
2561880	2563560	Because you work so hard.
2563560	2564520	I try to.
2564520	2565960	Yeah, wait.
2565960	2567920	Let me Tyler Durden you a little bit here.
2567960	2570120	Let me Dr. Filia.
2570120	2571960	Jeff.
2571960	2572920	I see Jeff.
2576240	2579200	He's checking for his wallet.
2579200	2579960	In the jacket.
2582960	2585160	He produced his phone.
2585160	2588480	How is that working out for you?
2588480	2590680	I saw a Stuber.
2590680	2592000	The Kubeel movie?
2592000	2593960	What does Stuber stand for?
2593960	2595960	Well, his name is Stu.
2595960	2597720	He's in an Uber.
2598360	2599680	Whoa.
2599680	2602760	And it's about a different guy.
2602760	2604560	It's about Kubeel.
2604560	2607000	Isn't it about the shooting guy's guy?
2607000	2608480	Dave Batista.
2608480	2610880	I think he's called shooting guy's guy.
2610880	2612360	No, it's a buddy comedy.
2612360	2613760	There's a dog in the poster, too.
2613760	2615520	There's a dog in the poster because Dave.
2615520	2617320	Which means I should go see it in the theater
2617320	2619120	because I can't watch it on Apple TV.
2619120	2621880	My fucking dogs will go shit.
2621880	2622920	It's a blind movie.
2622920	2625480	I thought it was OK.
2625480	2627320	I'm biased because I love anything
2627320	2630920	Kubeel does, and I think him and Dave are great together.
2630920	2635360	I would love to see them do another movie together.
2635360	2638520	No offense to this Dave Batista guy who seems very charming
2638520	2640680	and has a good relationship with him on screen,
2640680	2644160	but I would love to see Kubeel in a North by Northwest
2644160	2645440	every man.
2645440	2648040	Leave out the buddy cop thing.
2648040	2651760	I want to see Kubeel do Cary Grant.
2651760	2653640	Oh, shit, there's a microfilm, and then the guy's
2653640	2654920	going to knife us back at Kubeel.
2654920	2655520	What happened?
2655520	2658280	I think he's on the way to be a big star.
2658280	2658880	I think so.
2658880	2660960	He's going to be in a Marvel movie next.
2660960	2662200	Well, he's very talented.
2662200	2663520	And he's really likable.
2663520	2665520	He has his moments.
2665520	2667480	I think he's great.
2667480	2668880	Love the guy.
2668880	2671880	We miss him.
2671880	2672720	I'm happy for him.
2672720	2675120	I text him quite often.
2675120	2675840	I text him, too.
2675840	2678920	The show's taking a dip.
2678920	2680120	He was a fun influence.
2680120	2681240	Me, me, me, me.
2681240	2689440	I was like, oh, shit, we can watch it now.
2689440	2690040	What the fuck?
2690040	2691080	Wait, what did I?
2691080	2694480	I think I text Cody, then I can remember.
2694480	2696320	What do you do when you're looking at your own text
2696320	2698560	messages to remember what you were thinking?
2698560	2700280	Do people go through this a lot?
2700280	2701800	I mean, my whole life, I've always
2701800	2703240	known what I wanted to do.
2703240	2707600	And then in the last three years, I've gone,
2707600	2708640	I don't know anymore.
2708640	2711200	I think that happens, yeah.
2712160	2717800	And it sucks, because you don't have an X on your treasure map
2717800	2718480	anymore.
2718480	2721960	And most people would say, I mean,
2721960	2724080	would say that's actually a good thing,
2724080	2725680	because life can be exciting again.
2725680	2727400	Because that's everyone's X, yeah.
2727400	2730200	Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
2730200	2732160	But I've been always, unfortunately,
2732160	2735280	and this is a problem in my life, I've always gone,
2735280	2736320	well, I'll do this.
2736320	2738760	And then after that, I'll be able to do
2738760	2740600	what I really want to do.
2740600	2745680	And I've been following that carrot for 20 years.
2745680	2746760	So is Spielberg.
2746760	2750880	And I've found out that there's no carrot.
2750880	2752920	And now I'm like, well, now what?
2752920	2754600	And I've wasted my time searching for carrot.
2754600	2755600	You don't waste your time.
2755600	2756840	It wasn't wasted.
2756840	2759280	But I'm lost.
2759280	2760440	I don't know how to even.
2760440	2761440	Bob Dylan?
2761440	2762520	Is that a guy?
2762520	2766040	I think Bob Dylan, he puts metal together.
2766040	2768680	He's a good singing guy, and he's like, you know what?
2768680	2769400	This is stupid.
2769400	2771840	I want to put metal together.
2771840	2774080	I think a thing that a lot of creative people, I don't know.
2774080	2776360	I think part of it is just humans
2776360	2780680	are designed to be happy in the middle of something.
2780680	2783480	But then when they feel like they get what they're achieving
2783480	2785000	or they kind of get some taste of it,
2785000	2786600	they're like, actually, this sucked.
2786600	2787440	And I think it's like.
2787440	2788400	But I haven't even gotten that far.
2788400	2789680	You've gotten pieces of it.
2789680	2791800	Bird Box.
2791800	2792680	Bird Box.
2792680	2794480	I was like, oh, shit, that's got to be rented.
2794480	2796200	Birds delivered to your house.
2796200	2798760	I want to see this Bird Box movie
2798760	2802320	where you can't look at shit or you go crazy.
2802320	2802880	I don't know.
2802880	2804040	Show me what's chasing me.
2804040	2804920	I'm going to go crazy.
2804920	2805640	I haven't seen that.
2805640	2806760	Yeah, Bird Box.
2806760	2809800	I hear there's this alligator movie, Crawl, came out.
2809800	2812000	You know the thing about that alligator movie, Crawl,
2812000	2813160	that came out?
2813160	2817160	There was an episode of American Dad where a house floods
2817160	2820040	and then a shark is attacking everyone in the house.
2820040	2823520	And that's the movie Crawl.
2823520	2824960	It's an episode of American Dad.
2824960	2827840	It's also the movie Bait from Australia.
2827920	2831840	But it's by the person that did that Daniel Radcliffe is
2831840	2834120	Horns, right?
2834120	2834920	He sure is.
2834920	2836120	Same director.
2836120	2837480	See that Horns movie?
2837480	2837880	No.
2837880	2840480	Daniel Radcliffe wakes up and he's like, I got Horns.
2840480	2842080	And it's like mystical realism.
2842080	2844200	And I was like, OK.
2847200	2850960	Oh, wake me when you're Star Wars, bro.
2850960	2852240	That's me with every movie.
2852240	2854880	I'm like, whoa, where's the light sabers?
2854880	2857440	No, you're not.
2857440	2861400	I don't like mystical realism unless it's
2861400	2867560	so mystical that it tracks.
2867560	2869760	I don't like it when people are just like,
2869760	2872840	hey, there's a fish on my toe.
2872840	2875120	And then someone else is like, boomerang.
2875120	2876360	I'm like, OK, what's that?
2876360	2879360	Those movies are the worst.
2879360	2880640	Those are crazy movies.
2881120	2882120	Yeah.
2882120	2887520	Should we get Jeff out?
2887520	2888520	No, no.
2888520	2889520	I screwed up.
2889520	2890520	I screwed up.
2890520	2891320	I don't.
2891320	2894160	When's the last time you saw the movie Orca?
2894160	2896280	Never.
2896280	2897680	Try never.
2897680	2900160	A little attempt to cash it in the Jaws.
2900160	2902040	I've seen a lot of Jaws rip offs.
2902040	2904200	There were killer whales always in the ocean
2904200	2905880	since the beginning of time, really.
2905960	2913400	And so Jaws came out to, I think, positive reception.
2913400	2916800	And people were in a flurry.
2916800	2919440	They were like, I would also like
2919440	2922320	to make a movie about a thing under the sea that eats people.
2922320	2924000	And they were like, oh, my god, there's
2924000	2925600	these things called killer whales.
2925600	2928240	We should make a movie about them.
2928240	2929680	Orca, Orca.
2929680	2933080	Orca, it was called Orca, like probably 1978, 1979.
2933080	2935600	Wasn't Quinn's ship called the Orca?
2935640	2937520	Yes.
2937520	2938520	There's a connection.
2938520	2940480	Well, because Orca's, I think, if they see a shark,
2940480	2941760	they'll fucking annihilate it.
2941760	2942360	Yeah, man.
2942360	2944120	I don't know if Orca's ever do see sharks, though.
2944120	2944960	Where do Orca's live?
2944960	2946400	Don't they live in, like, fucking?
2946400	2947200	Pennsylvania.
2950800	2953920	That bagel boss guy.
2953920	2955600	He's a charlatan.
2955600	2958680	He was pretty angry, pretty pissed off.
2958680	2961880	That's what he thought would make the video go viral.
2961880	2964240	You're just playing into his hands.
2964240	2965640	Yeah, but that's OK, right?
2965640	2967160	Isn't it?
2967160	2968360	Well, I'll tell you.
2968360	2970680	When I saw it scrolling through my feed,
2970680	2972800	being shared by multiple people, I was like,
2972800	2974120	I don't like the smell of this.
2974120	2974920	I ain't watching.
2974920	2977360	And someone's like, bagel boss is a fake.
2977360	2978040	He's a phony.
2978040	2979360	And I'm like, I knew it.
2979360	2981640	I smelled the right smell.
2981640	2982800	He's a fake?
2982800	2985440	You mean he went into a stage?
2985440	2987240	Yeah, that's what I was trying to express.
2987240	2989000	Even the people behind the counter?
2989000	2991600	No, no, that's what sucks about it.
2991600	2994000	He's just like, I'm going to act crazy and get online.
2994000	2995840	Oh, do you think he had a friend tackle him?
2995840	2996720	I'm fair.
2996720	2997960	I don't know about that.
2997960	2998960	Well, it depends on where you just go.
2998960	3001640	If you define fake, it's just like he purposely
3001640	3004040	was being belligerent, knowing that something would happen,
3004040	3005680	that he's consistently been doing that.
3005680	3006120	But that's not fake.
3006120	3008880	That's going into a public space and being a dickhead, which
3008880	3009440	is the video.
3009440	3010760	Yeah, to be online, yeah.
3010760	3014920	Yeah, yeah, which is why I was worried only for five seconds
3014920	3016040	he was going to kill himself.
3016040	3018160	And then I found out he's a person who,
3018160	3020600	this is the shit that he rolls around in.
3020600	3023320	And I was like, whew.
3023640	3025800	One other person's not going to commit suicide because of,
3025800	3027560	like, fucking internet infamy.
3027560	3028240	He wanted it.
3028240	3029120	He wanted it.
3029120	3031280	And if the audience wants it and he wants it,
3031280	3032920	then it's kind of like almost.
3032920	3036480	But they want it because it's real.
3036480	3038480	How real do they really want it to be,
3038480	3040800	though, when they're like, would they
3040800	3042960	want to be responsible for him blowing his brains out?
3042960	3044280	I want to be responsible for it.
3044280	3045400	I'd take pride in that.
3045400	3046600	I'd hang that on my wall.
3046600	3047800	Oh, come on.
3047800	3049600	Internet asshole blows his brains out.
3049600	3052280	You'd hang the bagel boss of video.
3052280	3053120	I'm not being glib.
3053200	3055440	I want a lot of people to die.
3055440	3059640	You would hang the bagel boss video on the wall
3059640	3060760	and be proud of it.
3060760	3061240	No.
3061240	3062240	First of all, yes.
3065240	3067280	First of all, yes.
3067280	3073960	No, it would be like an award for most bagel bosses killed.
3073960	3075880	You know, we never finished the, you never
3075880	3080160	got a chance to explain what the fuck happened with the bees.
3080160	3082840	As uneventful as it was, like we introduced
3082880	3086720	the segment, Spencer explains what happened with the bees.
3086720	3088200	Oh, I didn't notice that.
3088200	3088960	Did that happen?
3088960	3090000	Did I not?
3090000	3091520	I thought I told the whole story.
3091520	3094600	Yeah, well, I want the mundane story
3094600	3097360	because I've never witnessed bees being like excavated
3097360	3098360	from a wall before.
3098360	3099000	What happened?
3099000	3099500	All right.
3099500	3101600	So the guy who did the estimate, he was like,
3101600	3103760	we're going to have to open the wall, close the wall.
3103760	3105080	We're working construction.
3105080	3106680	It'll be bing, bang, boom.
3106680	3107720	The guy comes out.
3107720	3110200	He's like, this is a retaining wall.
3110200	3111320	Who gave you this estimate?
3111320	3112920	And I was like, I don't know.
3112920	3114240	He was like young, some young.
3114240	3116320	He was like, some young guy, like Anthony.
3116320	3117480	And I'm like, I don't know.
3117480	3118160	Sure.
3118160	3120640	And he was like, yeah, this is a retaining wall.
3120640	3122560	You don't want to damage a retaining wall.
3122560	3124120	You know, mess with the structural integrity.
3124120	3126920	We can repair it, but it's never going to be the same kind of wall.
3126920	3131680	I'm like, well, there's still bees.
3131680	3133720	And the bees are now being used as an excuse
3133720	3137840	by the fifth in a series of children's crusades
3137840	3140280	to like make my stereo work.
3140280	3141400	Yeah.
3141400	3143080	We thought it was, yeah.
3143080	3145600	And now I've moved out of the house and probably
3145600	3148800	investing in Apple Home Pods and never going to look back.
3148800	3150560	But at least all those children died.
3150560	3151880	People are just going to, yeah.
3151880	3154600	So what did they, all right, so what did they do?
3154600	3157160	They just walked away from the retaining wall?
3157160	3161160	He was like, OK, so he looked at it and thought about it a bit.
3161160	3163680	He was like, OK, so what I'm going to do
3163680	3166360	is I'm going to dig down because the retaining wall is
3166360	3167240	up against a hill.
3167240	3170120	And so there's a bunch of dirt so you can stand in front of the wall
3170120	3172040	and shovel down with the shovel.
3172040	3174000	And I was like, OK, that sounds great.
3174000	3175400	He was like, do you got a shovel?
3175400	3177840	And I'm like, I could get a shovel.
3177840	3181080	So he's standing up where the coyotes go.
3181080	3181640	No, no.
3181640	3182440	He's up there, no.
3182440	3185320	No, so you have this, it's the patio wall
3185320	3189640	against which is like the barbecue and stuff,
3189640	3191360	that lower wall.
3191360	3192320	Oh, that wall?
3192320	3194600	Yeah, that's the one the bees are all up on.
3194600	3195760	It's a little short wall.
3195760	3196280	Yeah.
3196280	3197000	Oh, OK.
3197000	3199120	So he's like standing over it, chest high,
3199120	3203120	and just hacking at it with a garden trowel that I found.
3203120	3204800	So he's using the garden trowel.
3204800	3206720	He digs, it must have been like five feet.
3206720	3208800	I don't know, he did it very fast.
3208800	3210240	But I was like, I feel like you're
3210240	3212600	going to need a bigger shovel or something.
3212600	3214880	He did not need a bigger shovel, he didn't need buckets.
3214880	3216800	He just kind of tossed the dirt backwards,
3216800	3219440	not backwards behind him, up the hill.
3219440	3223280	And he eventually got, he got down there enough.
3223280	3226520	And then he turns on the bee vacuum.
3226520	3227640	There's a bee vacuum.
3227960	3229280	Oh.
3229280	3232800	And he's just vacuuming bees for like an hour,
3232800	3235960	I want to say, like an hour and a half.
3235960	3239160	And the bee vacuum looks very much like a shop vac that's
3239160	3241800	just, it probably is.
3241800	3242760	It probably is.
3242760	3246000	Well, if it isn't, I would be like, get a shop vac.
3246000	3246800	Yeah.
3246800	3249320	But it's attached to one of these bee boxes.
3249320	3253960	Like it's a big, maybe quadruple shoebox size wooden box.
3253960	3257120	And I'm like, well, how do you take the lid off that thing?
3257120	3258600	There's just bees all over the place.
3258600	3261600	But I'm not asking questions, it's too loud.
3261600	3263480	You just take that box and sell it
3263480	3267240	to like almond farmers who are like not paying top price.
3267240	3269280	But like, here's your bee colony you
3269280	3271360	wanted to pollinate your fucking orchard.
3271360	3272960	That's like, little do they know they're
3272960	3276360	like these embattled, confused, traumatized bees
3276360	3279000	with no queen who are just like angry at the world.
3279000	3280520	I asked him what he did with the bees
3280520	3282320	and he said he puts it in a cardboard box
3282320	3283440	and sends it to an enemy.
3286000	3286920	You made a new friend.
3287720	3288520	Yeah, we were great.
3288520	3292040	I was like, you know this bagel box guy?
3292040	3293840	How did he say that last part?
3293840	3296600	Did he like give you like a little wink at the end
3296600	3297480	or go, hoo hoo?
3297480	3300680	Well, he nudged me in the ribs with his elbow.
3300680	3301520	Did he really?
3301520	3303640	No, none of this.
3303640	3304800	There wasn't even a bee guy.
3304800	3305880	I just hit it with a pose.
3305880	3306640	Oh, Jesus.
3306640	3307240	No, OK.
3307240	3311560	So he doesn't send the bee box to his enemies.
3311560	3312280	He doesn't?
3312280	3312960	No, he doesn't.
3312960	3313840	He didn't say that.
3313840	3315480	That was an embellishment, no.
3315480	3318040	I thought that might be a funny thing to say at a comedy show.
3318040	3319800	It also might be true that it's a funny thing
3319800	3321920	that he would say, because he's in that business.
3321920	3324440	That would have been funnier if he actually said it, yeah.
3324440	3325320	He's earnest.
3325320	3328040	No, he's just a consummate professional, this guy.
3328040	3330880	He had a cool looking apiarist outfit.
3330880	3333800	In Minecraft you can make one, but it takes a fucking nightmare.
3333800	3335880	An apiarist is a bee man.
3335880	3338480	What say it slower and louder?
3338480	3343600	Apiarist, A-P-I-A-R-I-S-T, apiarist.
3343600	3345480	B is nowhere in that word.
3345480	3348040	No, apiary is a bee thing.
3348040	3350920	An apiary is like a bee house or something.
3350920	3353600	But it's ape?
3353600	3355000	Don't, I'm trying.
3355000	3357000	I know, but just can't you just let it go as language?
3357000	3359240	I'm trying to learn so I can be as smart as you.
3359240	3361440	Then if I'm smart, I'll be happy.
3361440	3363400	What's the name of a?
3363400	3366600	So like a bug scientist is like an entomologist, right?
3366600	3367720	There's no word bug scientist.
3367720	3368760	They say that.
3368760	3369880	No, it's not though.
3369880	3372960	But it's like entomology has nothing to do with bug or insect
3372960	3373440	or anything.
3373440	3375880	It's just a word that means the thing.
3375880	3376840	Yeah.
3376840	3377760	It's just language.
3377760	3378440	It's silly sometimes.
3378440	3381440	And it's all due to etymology, which has nothing to do with insects.
3381440	3381960	Yeah.
3381960	3383040	All right, come on.
3383040	3384760	So he vacuums up the bees.
3384760	3385240	Stop.
3385240	3388320	Will you stop for a second?
3388320	3393480	Your quest for fucking truth about every word?
3393480	3395400	I just want to understand.
3395400	3396320	Yeah, yeah.
3396320	3398000	I hope you do.
3398000	3399920	But there's bees.
3399920	3402480	He vacuumed them up, put them in his bee box.
3402480	3405840	He takes off the top of this bee vacuum.
3405840	3407160	There's a little screen down there.
3407160	3408200	The bees can't come out.
3408200	3410400	I don't know how that happens because the bee vacuum
3410400	3412600	was on top of that screen.
3412600	3414960	So maybe the screen slides in through some.
3414960	3417040	But then the bee could get out from there.
3417040	3417600	I don't know.
3417600	3418760	I didn't question it.
3418760	3419800	He had the bees in a box.
3419800	3422400	There is something like 300, 400 bees.
3422400	3426280	There is still about 16, 20 bees, maybe 40 bees kind of flying around,
3426280	3427640	buzzing around the outside.
3427640	3429320	He got all the honeycomb up out of there.
3429320	3432000	And I think he put it in a trash bag.
3432000	3432800	I know.
3432800	3433960	He would have been delicious.
3433960	3435240	Did he give you a little taste?
3435240	3437000	He didn't even hand it off to a bear.
3437000	3439080	Did he mention the queen?
3439080	3440000	He did not.
3440000	3441200	I did not ask about the queen.
3441200	3441800	Is the queen still in there?
3441800	3443680	No, presumably the queen was taken with it.
3443680	3450000	Because the queen would have been, what do you call it?
3450000	3451240	Sacrosanct?
3451240	3453080	Sacrosanct.
3453080	3456480	It would have been stationed up in the honeycomb, which he removed.
3456480	3457560	And I don't know.
3457560	3460680	If you kill the queen, I think you don't kill the queen
3460680	3462360	if you can avoid it.
3462360	3465680	But yeah, I think maybe he just vacuumed it up.
3465680	3468360	He was very thick in the hose.
3468360	3469640	Yeah, you expected me.
3469640	3473720	At the end, he goes, oh, that was the queen.
3473720	3474520	Yeah, exactly.
3474520	3476120	It just spluts onto the bottom of the box.
3476120	3480400	I guess professional apiarists, people that cultivate bees, what they'll do
3480400	3484640	is you can just smoke the bees.
3484640	3485560	Make some more man.
3485560	3489600	Question number one, why does spraying smoke
3489600	3492240	all over bees calm them down?
3492240	3493120	What a dumb design flaw.
3493120	3494960	I think it confuses them, right?
3494960	3496040	I think they can't see.
3496040	3499280	And they just kind of like, that should be a pretty fundamental thing
3499280	3502560	for all life is like, oh, there's smoke.
3502560	3505480	I should get upset about it.
3505480	3507160	Dan, let me tell you this.
3507160	3511480	If you're driving and there's a fog, do you drive faster?
3511480	3512480	You drive more calmly.
3512480	3514080	No, I drive slower.
3514080	3516440	OK.
3516440	3518120	I think it's much more morbid.
3518160	3522320	All right, look, OB hive.
3522320	3525560	It's not working very well for bees.
3525560	3529440	It is an exploitable defect in their fucking consciousness
3529440	3530880	that they react to smoke that way.
3530880	3533360	I think it's more like when you park in your garage
3533360	3536880	and you leave your window open and the engine running,
3536880	3540440	and then you fall asleep and then you die, I think it's more like that.
3540440	3542120	Oh, you think they're getting high off the smoke?
3542120	3544560	Well, not high so much as suffocating.
3544560	3546360	They're not taking in as much oxygen.
3546360	3546860	Right.
3547500	3551580	Yeah, because I think some of them get a little sleep.
3551580	3552300	I don't think so.
3552300	3553700	I don't think it's enough to kill them.
3553700	3555620	Poisoning them, roofing them.
3555620	3558380	Yeah, I don't know that they hack and cough and scream running out
3558380	3559940	of the building, but some of them do.
3559940	3561820	I think some of them get a lot more pissed off
3561820	3562940	when the smoke is happening.
3562940	3563540	I don't know.
3563540	3566420	And the whole thing is, he's in a fucking outfit anyway.
3566420	3568420	What does it matter if the bees are pissed or not pissed?
3568420	3569700	They're not going to do anything.
3569700	3571140	He's like impenetrable.
3571140	3574580	Yeah, the people that deal with bees all the time
3574580	3577100	and make honey or whatever the fuck they're doing,
3577100	3577980	they're in the business.
3577980	3580220	You can just get queens through the mail.
3580220	3585140	And then queens have a certain lifespan, five, seven years
3585140	3586580	or something.
3586580	3591500	Your bee colony needs to be a little less sluggish than that.
3591500	3595340	They'll get high on the hog at the end of Queen Victoria's rain.
3595340	3601620	And they'll just pull out the queen, put a new queen in there.
3601620	3604180	And the bees will be like, OK, cool.
3604620	3607780	I guess we're making honey for her now.
3607780	3610860	What an exploitable bunch of numerons.
3610860	3612740	I mean, they're flying insects that
3612740	3613940	have stingers on their bodies.
3613940	3617540	They have no idea how close they are to being like so,
3617540	3620660	like they could have taken over like that.
3620660	3621260	Oh, yeah.
3621260	3623740	And I'm terrified of them.
3623740	3626180	And it's extra terrifying when you
3626180	3628140	learn that they're like super intelligent,
3628140	3629540	they have their own alphabet, and they
3629540	3631700	make these hexagonal fucking things.
3631740	3635860	Jesus Christ, that's scary shit.
3635860	3638780	They just need to be a little more evil.
3638780	3643300	And they could really have us over a barrel instead.
3643300	3645100	They're making like Chapstick for us.
3645100	3646140	They're hanging out.
3646140	3647660	And they're on the endangered list
3647660	3649540	along with every other fucking thing.
3649540	3650140	Yeah.
3650140	3651620	Big dummies.
3651620	3654540	Way to go, you big dumb shit bees.
3657820	3660860	Yeah, you're on the list, along with you
3660860	3666780	dopey gorillas, you dumb fucked your ass, stupid ants,
3666780	3673020	you fucking foxes, stupid ass clover eating deer,
3673020	3676260	fucking marmots, whatever that is.
3676260	3677540	Mammocets.
3677540	3679300	I'm making shit up now.
3679300	3680820	It's all stupid.
3680820	3682860	You know what you should have done?
3682860	3686020	Five fingers and a big ass brain.
3686020	3686620	What?
3686620	3688340	Yeah.
3688340	3689460	What?
3689460	3689940	What?
3689940	3691660	What?
3691660	3692180	What?
3692180	3694300	What, five fingers up?
3694300	3696180	Should have a brain up their ass?
3696180	3697660	No.
3697660	3701500	Why would you add up the butt to what me just saying?
3701500	3702500	What?
3702500	3703380	Is that painful?
3703380	3705540	If I told you how the sixth sense end,
3705540	3707260	would you be like, what?
3707260	3708940	He's dead up the ass?
3708940	3710500	Why would you just add up the ass?
3710500	3711460	No, no, no.
3711460	3714420	If you said five fingers and.
3714420	3716620	Yeah, why did you take it there?
3716620	3719180	I'm not kink shaming you, but what the fuck, dude?
3719180	3721980	I'm like making a really salient point.
3721980	3723380	I'm just trying to fill time.
3723380	3725660	Look, none of us want to be here.
3725660	3727460	I love it.
3727460	3729100	Anyway, the bees.
3729100	3731540	Yeah, so I'm glad I got to hear the end of that story.
3731540	3733060	He sprays the bees.
3733060	3737260	He sprays the thing with an anti-bee pheromone or something.
3737260	3738540	He says, the bees hate this.
3738540	3739580	They hate this.
3739580	3741660	And then he covers it back up.
3741660	3743700	And then he takes the bee box down to his car.
3743700	3746500	But there's bees outside the bee box kind of hovering around.
3746500	3748740	They're like, where's all the bees going?
3748740	3750780	He puts it into his car, and there's a couple bees
3750780	3752420	that are trying to get into his car.
3752420	3755460	And I'm like, oh, man, do bees ever get out in your car?
3755460	3757260	And he's like, yeah, one or two.
3757260	3758460	And I'm like, man, that's nuts.
3758460	3760660	He's like, that's fine.
3760660	3763420	That's an occupational hazardous loose bees in the car.
3763420	3764820	And he's just come to terms with it.
3764820	3766340	He must have been stung a million times.
3766340	3767860	And he's just like, yeah, whatever.
3767860	3768860	I asked him about that.
3768860	3770660	He said, not too many times.
3770660	3773860	He said, I can remember the last time I got stung.
3773860	3776900	Well, then why is he so chill about a bee in his car?
3776900	3779820	A one bee in your car is our definition of an emergency.
3779820	3780820	Why is he so?
3780820	3782260	What right does he have to be like?
3782260	3784820	Did he say when was the last time he got, like,
3784820	3786940	who was president, like, when he got stung?
3786940	3787540	Yeah.
3787540	3788540	Who?
3788540	3789380	Obama.
3789380	3790540	Obama.
3790540	3793820	He got stung when Obama was president.
3793820	3794380	Yeah.
3794380	3796180	First or second term?
3796180	3796660	I don't know.
3796660	3798100	I didn't ask which term.
3798100	3802340	I mean, is there any end to that guy's fuck-ups as a president?
3802340	3802820	I know.
3802820	3804580	Thanks, Obama.
3804900	3807620	On top of everything else, he got that guy stung.
3807620	3809380	And then he said he takes him to his house.
3809380	3813100	He has, like, a property where you think he just, he's
3813100	3815140	like a hoarder of bees.
3815140	3817500	He puts the bees in, like, a bee apartment.
3817500	3821020	I feel sorry for the bees that got left behind.
3821020	3821620	They love it.
3821620	3822820	They're having new friends.
3822820	3823340	Oh, yeah.
3823340	3824860	No, that's terrible, actually, to think about.
3824860	3824900	I feel sorry.
3824900	3826740	All these bees that end up in my swimming pool,
3826740	3827980	I keep, like, scooping them out.
3827980	3831420	And it's like, they're just like, they're.
3831420	3832740	Why do they go in the water?
3832740	3834100	They're thirsty, as someone told me.
3834540	3836780	And I'm like, that's silly.
3836780	3838620	With their bees, they could get water anywhere.
3838620	3840420	There's dew drops.
3840420	3842180	Don't take a living to, like, a.
3842180	3844900	That's proof that bees can't tell stories.
3844900	3847300	Yeah, because they wiggle out of the pool,
3847300	3848380	and then I'll, like, let them out.
3848380	3850580	I'll put them on a pair of, I'll take a pair of swim trunks
3850580	3852060	or something, and I'll go, like, scoop.
3852060	3853900	And I'll put them on the edge of the pool.
3853900	3855900	I'll go, like, there you go, you did it.
3855900	3858980	You're supposedly, like, 70% of the food web or something.
3858980	3860820	I hope you do well.
3860820	3864020	And then the bee is like, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.
3864020	3864780	He can't be flying.
3864780	3866620	And he's like, nah, nah, nah, nah.
3866620	3869060	He gets the, he works it all out, and he's like, god damn,
3869060	3872620	can't believe I fell into a giant vat of chlorinated,
3872620	3874580	fucking, like, water.
3874580	3877980	And he, like, walks right back with plops on the pool.
3877980	3880340	These fucking things, I'm like, I did one,
3880340	3881980	I did three rounds with one of them,
3881980	3883540	and then I fucking smushed it.
3883540	3886900	I was like, and you can't, I told him,
3886900	3889580	I said, this is God talking to you.
3889580	3890940	You have done this twice.
3890940	3894940	Like, I cannot allow you to keep walking into my pool.
3894940	3896700	You are self-destructive.
3896700	3898500	And I am no stranger to that.
3898500	3900740	Maybe the chlorine made him, uh.
3900740	3901580	He loves it.
3901580	3903180	I messed up his brain.
3903180	3905660	Maybe he's a bee with the right priorities.
3905660	3908660	He's like, dude, I'm in Hollywood, I'm in a pool.
3908660	3910180	Like, what are you trying to do, man?
3910180	3911780	This is where I wanted to go out.
3911780	3913180	You're not in Hollywood.
3915180	3916020	Damn.
3917780	3919500	You know, they used to call them king bees,
3919740	3921460	because they couldn't fathom queen, or, you know,
3921460	3923660	a woman being in charge of all those bees.
3925700	3926540	Really?
3926540	3928180	Yeah, I think it was Aristotle, who's, like,
3928180	3929020	famously sexist.
3929020	3931620	Remember the Roland Emmerich Godzilla movie,
3931620	3934340	where they were, like, where Godzilla, like,
3934340	3937260	gave birth to a bunch of baby Godzillas,
3937260	3942140	and they said, oh, this male must give birth, too.
3942140	3944060	And it's like, just, you can't.
3944060	3945900	Just say Godzilla's a girl you.
3945900	3948660	God damn it, why couldn't Godzilla be a woman?
3948660	3950620	Well, because then YouTube would have fuckin'...
3950620	3952660	Oh, man, my feet.
3952660	3954940	I'm sorry, I refuse to review this movie.
3956420	3961220	They didn't mind making Godzilla into a prancing ballerina,
3961220	3966220	but they had, they said, well, this one's not a girl.
3966220	3968300	Yeah, I thought it was fucked up.
3968300	3970220	It was like a story point where they kept, like, saying,
3970220	3974620	well, it's strange, because usually the male doesn't give birth.
3974620	3976420	It's usually the other sex.
3976420	3977820	Whoa.
3977820	3980580	I mean, like, God is writing his name.
3980580	3985580	Did you, do you remember when we met with those guys?
3985580	3988500	Yes, when they wanted to do Godzilla, too.
3988500	3990420	Yeah.
3990420	3994340	I'm older than both of them now.
3994340	3995540	We met with those guys.
3995540	3997020	Yeah.
3997020	3999140	That was another career non-changer,
3999140	4001660	because we pissed them off, like, I...
4001660	4002780	I don't think they pissed them off,
4002780	4006300	but I think nobody wanted to see their version of a sequel.
4006300	4009180	No, well, we could have come out of that meeting
4009180	4011780	with those guys going, like, this is Harmon and Trav, guys.
4011780	4015620	They're cool, but we insulted them on accident.
4015620	4015940	How?
4015940	4017980	How did you remember how?
4017980	4021020	Because we said we were...
4021020	4022460	Their movie was a piece of shit.
4022460	4024180	We were talking about the giant robot movie
4024180	4027460	that we were writing at the time, and we were like,
4027460	4032300	like, we were like, yeah, no, it's not like your movie.
4032300	4035100	It's going to be just like old school guys in suits,
4035100	4037740	and then they're...
4037740	4039700	Roland Emmerich was like...
4039700	4043140	I remember him as smoking, like, holding a cigarette like this,
4043140	4045180	but I don't know if he was actually doing it.
4045180	4048380	He's so German that I was like, just remember him like this.
4048380	4052300	What if you put a dog's head on a Jew's body?
4052300	4055180	Didn't say that. He didn't say that.
4055180	4057060	No, he did not say that. He said Jewish.
4057060	4060220	He said Jewish.
4060220	4062420	He was very tasteful about it.
4062420	4063740	No, but I just picture...
4063820	4064980	Are you sure he wasn't smoking?
4064980	4066740	Why was that smoking? We were in the war.
4066740	4070060	Well, it was his... I mean, he owned fucking Columbia.
4070060	4071460	He wasn't smoking.
4071460	4073380	It was like...
4073380	4076180	Anyways, but yeah, because remember,
4076180	4079220	they kind of blanched when we said...
4079220	4081020	We mentioned guys in suits.
4081020	4081860	I do remember this.
4081860	4085580	And then they said, like, Dean Devlin said,
4085580	4086980	Godzilla was a guy in a suit.
4086980	4089620	Like, they're Godzilla, and you said,
4089620	4091420	yeah, motion control suit.
4091420	4093060	We were just sort of like...
4093060	4094100	Pfft!
4094100	4096260	Like, why are we bullying them?
4096260	4098620	But we didn't mean to, but I don't think we hit it off.
4098620	4100060	Well, we came out of the gate saying,
4100060	4102340	well, what we wanted to do is take something really dumb
4102340	4103500	and make it cool.
4103500	4104340	And I was like...
4104340	4105340	That was Emmerich said it.
4105340	4107340	He said, like, you watch those old Godzilla movies
4107340	4108420	and they're so cheesy,
4108420	4109700	and we just wanted to make it less cheesy,
4109700	4111860	and you wanted to murder them.
4111860	4113980	Yeah, I would fucking kick them in the nuts.
4113980	4115660	But you don't regret that, right?
4115660	4116660	No, not at all.
4116660	4119860	Great. So that's a good example of...
4119860	4121980	So you're going through some woes right now.
4121980	4124420	Like, what's the real voice inside your head?
4124420	4125860	Don't you think that's thematically connected?
4125860	4127340	Where it's like, you know, you're like,
4127340	4128500	when am I going to get a break?
4128500	4130460	Like, or like, why, you know, it's like,
4130460	4131900	you don't want to be on the wrong side
4131900	4134020	of your own personal history.
4134020	4137060	I mean, you're a creative guy that has
4137060	4138580	answers to a higher calling.
4138580	4140420	Like, the reason for your current woes
4140420	4143420	are precisely because you give too much of a fuck,
4143420	4145580	not too much, like, pejoratively speaking.
4145580	4148860	Like, you give too much of a fuck for then.
4148860	4151980	And like, it's problematic for them
4151980	4153380	that you give so much of a fuck,
4153380	4155820	that you're like, why do you want your thing to be shitty?
4155820	4158780	And they're like, fuck you, like, kind of thing, whatever.
4158780	4159980	Like, it happens to me a million.
4159980	4161220	I mean, like, whatever.
4161220	4166220	Like, at the end of your life,
4166260	4171100	you're going to be like, God, thank God.
4171100	4173100	Like, what's the alternative to that?
4173100	4174700	Like, it's called selling out.
4174700	4177340	Like, I don't want to be like Tyler Durden about it,
4177340	4181500	or it's like, ooh, I think there's just as much joy
4181500	4184180	to doing what people want you to do,
4184180	4187380	but, you know, you're cool.
4187380	4188620	Everybody likes you.
4188620	4190860	Like, fucking, fuck off.
4190860	4192340	You didn't fuck off.
4192340	4193180	This is it.
4193180	4194020	Yeah, all right.
4194020	4196740	You guys know about counter-transference?
4196740	4197740	Yes.
4197740	4199500	Okay, moving on.
4199500	4201060	Now, what is it?
4201060	4203060	What is counter-transference?
4203060	4205620	It's when a therapist is like,
4205620	4209380	projecting their own situation onto the client's situation
4209380	4210620	and giving them advice.
4210620	4212340	I think my therapist is doing that a lot.
4212340	4213660	Oh, no.
4213660	4215820	This could be bad.
4215820	4219020	No, unless he thinks that I look a lot like him
4219020	4221140	with a haircut, and like, he's thinking of a time
4221140	4224380	where he had super long hair, and then he got his haircut,
4224380	4226100	and then like, someone give him a therapist degree
4226100	4226940	or something, and he just started.
4226940	4228580	But it could be in that example
4228580	4231740	that your therapist is like,
4231740	4234660	transferring like, some kind of like weird insecurity
4234660	4237740	about their anything, whether it's physical or not.
4237740	4238580	And then they're like,
4238580	4240100	why don't you just fucking get a haircut?
4240100	4243420	They're like, how is that going, by the way?
4243420	4244580	I haven't been.
4244580	4245740	He's had a thing.
4245740	4246580	I've had a thing.
4246580	4248260	We've had some things.
4248260	4250500	No, but when he brought up the haircut
4250500	4253100	for like, the billionth time or whatever, I was like,
4254860	4258460	I was like, do you think that like,
4258460	4260100	if I went to another therapist,
4260100	4261900	they would say stuff like this?
4261900	4263540	Or do you think that's just you?
4263540	4265180	And he was like, well, there's this thing called
4265180	4267300	counter-transference, and I'm like, okay.
4268180	4269540	What the fuck?
4269540	4271700	Are you out of your fucking mind?
4271700	4273340	Our next guest.
4273340	4274780	This is gold over here.
4274780	4276620	You know, it's one thing, but it's me.
4276620	4277740	I'm listening, stop thinking.
4277740	4280340	The closest thing I'll ever have to a son.
4280340	4282420	You're gonna have kids, right?
4282420	4284380	Well, look at me.
4284380	4285380	I'm not gonna have kids.
4285380	4288540	I can't even get up out of this chair.
4288540	4290900	I don't wanna cast a value judgment.
4290900	4293500	I just thought that was an intention that was happening.
4294180	4296900	No, I'm like, Cody makes the world go around.
4296900	4299180	If she wants kids, there's gonna be kids,
4299180	4300940	but like, she's not sure.
4300940	4302620	All right, unless I get distracted by that.
4302620	4305500	I want my dog to live forever, or at least longer than me.
4305500	4306580	You can clone your dog.
4306580	4307420	Clone your dog.
4307420	4308300	It's not the same thing.
4308300	4309380	It will be.
4309380	4311340	I don't wanna, I don't wanna,
4311340	4312740	I don't wanna clone my dog.
4312740	4314780	Clone your dog before it dies,
4314780	4316140	and then they can be friends.
4316140	4318300	There's too many dogs out there that need homes,
4318300	4321060	and I'd rather give another home, but I-
4321060	4321900	Do both.
4321900	4326900	I just would rather that I die before Kate and Lolly.
4327420	4328660	I could arrange that.
4330100	4330980	Let's talk.
4330980	4332380	I used to tweet stuff like that,
4332380	4334540	and then Courtney Love would text somebody.
4334540	4337540	Like, you're sounding like, don't alarm.
4337540	4339700	Let the kids know that you're not gonna-
4339700	4342260	I'm fine, I'm fine, I'll get over it, but I don't know.
4342260	4343900	I'm sick of everything.
4343900	4344740	Hell yeah.
4344740	4347100	I like you that way.
4347100	4348180	That's punk rock. Visible.
4348180	4351260	Like, happy people are boring.
4351260	4355340	It's a flavor, it's like black licorice, it's yummy.
4357220	4361100	Life is darkness, but it's fun.
4361100	4365700	It's like, you got your health and God is a weirdo.
4365700	4366540	It's easy for you.
4366540	4368540	People listen to you.
4368540	4369940	People listen to you.
4369940	4371780	Yeah, and it's not making me any happier.
4371780	4372900	No, no, no.
4372900	4373740	So-
4373740	4375300	You gotta do a podcast, Rob.
4375300	4376740	Do your own podcast.
4377380	4378820	I don't have anything to say.
4378820	4380620	The Shropp cast.
4382900	4385980	All I've done is rack up a bunch more stories like you have,
4385980	4387780	where I'm like, and it's my own doing,
4387780	4388900	because people listen to me.
4388900	4391540	What you mean is like, oh, I don't get fired.
4391540	4394260	I fuck up and I quit or whatever.
4394260	4396020	It's like, that's the only difference.
4400260	4404100	It's like, I just, the more permission I get
4404100	4406100	to tell people what to do,
4406100	4407420	the more I let them down.
4407420	4411700	You should be like excited about like your dilemma.
4411700	4413940	Why am I telling you how to feel?
4413940	4417140	Like, you're living the dream, you little piece of shit.
4418660	4422340	I think that a lot of people, myself included,
4422340	4425260	think about their life in terms of,
4425260	4427300	I'm too old for it to happen.
4427300	4429020	Like everyone thinks that.
4429020	4431580	Yeah, what to happen, to play Cards Against Humanity?
4431580	4433500	Like, what is our dream?
4434500	4436340	Yeah, I'll tell you, swimming pool
4436340	4437980	turns out to be pretty fun.
4437980	4440060	But all right, so this transference thing.
4440060	4445060	The therapist, like, I like this.
4445060	4447100	Like, you pulled a real fucking.
4447100	4448740	Oh no, what have I done?
4448740	4452100	No, that was a fucking, like, that was a very,
4452100	4455380	dare I say, like me move on a therapist.
4455380	4456940	Like, where you were like, hey,
4456940	4459580	you think if I see another therapist,
4459580	4461180	they would talk this much shit?
4462180	4464780	Like asking them questions about their profession
4464780	4467100	and then the guy was like forced to open the hood
4467100	4468500	and go like, oh, well, there's this thing
4468500	4469340	called transference.
4469340	4471100	I bet you fucked him up real good.
4471100	4472420	Well, yeah, I mean, that's the thing,
4472420	4476100	is because I was not making eye contact with him
4476100	4477460	because I don't, because.
4477460	4478900	Because he asked you to once.
4478900	4481180	He asked me to, and also he just doesn't look great.
4481180	4482140	I don't want to look at that.
4482140	4484300	Yeah, you don't want to hear his soul cry.
4484300	4486540	Yeah, but I just mostly don't like that.
4486540	4488860	Also, I just don't want, I don't want to think
4488860	4490580	about looking about, like I want to think
4490580	4491540	about what I'm thinking about.
4491540	4492860	Anyway, but I wasn't.
4492860	4493820	They have no problem looking at you
4493820	4495860	while you're saying this because you're not looking at me.
4495860	4498140	And I like looking at you because you're great to look at,
4498140	4499380	especially because you're not looking at me.
4499380	4501100	Tell that to any woman.
4501100	4502460	Dr. Fuckface.
4502460	4506700	Yeah, Dr. Fuckface, no, it's true.
4506700	4509380	But so I, and then I asked him that, I was like, is that,
4509380	4512300	and then I was making the most direct eye contact.
4512300	4514620	I was like, I am going to eat you right now.
4514620	4518100	And I'm sure he loved that.
4518100	4520540	That's what he was wanting the whole time.
4520540	4524580	I had a threshold with my therapist once where I was,
4524580	4527580	I told her, I don't know how it came up in context,
4527580	4530060	but I was explaining to her.
4530060	4532300	I told, there's a story that I've told up here
4532300	4534700	at least once, if not twice or more.
4534700	4536700	We can skip it then.
4536700	4539340	I had a therapist who I stopped seeing
4539340	4541380	because she was crying while I was talking to her
4541380	4543700	about my childhood, but it wasn't really talking about
4543700	4546100	like cry worthy stuff about my childhood.
4546740	4548140	Here's my favorite book or something.
4548140	4549980	And then she was crying and I was like, why are you crying?
4549980	4552100	And she was like, it's very emotional stuff.
4552100	4553180	And I was like, no, it's not.
4553180	4555580	And then at the end of the session, she was like,
4555580	4557380	I feel really conflicted about this.
4557380	4560100	I'm really humiliated, but you called me out
4560100	4563380	on the years before I had some eye work done recently
4563380	4566060	and my eyes were watering and then my instinct
4566060	4569300	when you asked me why my eyes were watering was to lie.
4569300	4572100	And I was like, I thought in my head,
4572100	4575040	that's fine to make that mistake
4575040	4576840	and then to come clean about it.
4576840	4581440	And if you were my mechanic, it would be fine
4581440	4583920	to lie about it and blame me.
4585360	4588240	But my therapist, I think it's kind of a,
4588240	4591600	I just never went back and I'm sure she wasn't shocked.
4591600	4594200	And I hope she'd never thought,
4594200	4595760	oh, I shouldn't have been honest.
4595760	4598000	I hope she got the other messages.
4598000	4600160	I shouldn't have been dishonest.
4600160	4603160	But anyways, but I was telling that story
4603160	4607560	to my current therapist and my current therapist
4607560	4610600	kind of was like, she basically was sort of like,
4610600	4612520	why are you telling me this story?
4613400	4616240	And I was like, I don't know,
4616240	4617440	cause we were talking about this one thing
4617440	4620340	and she was like, are you maybe letting me know
4620340	4624760	that you're like a power user, like of therapy
4624760	4628440	and like, I shouldn't fuck around because,
4628440	4631200	and she said she sort of had a way of expressing.
4631200	4635080	She was kind of like, she didn't counter,
4635080	4638240	it wasn't like a, but I get the message from her
4638240	4640440	that it was like, because that would be a fucked up
4640440	4643240	environment in which I would have to work kind of.
4643240	4645360	And like, she humanized herself.
4645360	4649560	It was sort of like, she said what I would say maybe
4649560	4651720	if I was a therapist and someone was like,
4651720	4654080	well, one therapist, one time they fucked up
4654080	4655680	and I cut them loose.
4655680	4658700	And then I guess I would say to that patient,
4658700	4661000	I would go like, well, if what you're saying to me
4661000	4663040	is that this is a fucking minefield,
4663040	4665600	like I'm probably not gonna get any quality work done
4665600	4668200	while I'm like sweating and like worried
4668200	4670440	that I'm gonna cut the blue wire instead of the red wire.
4670440	4673660	And she kind of, and it was a big threshold for us,
4673660	4676560	like among many where I was like, oh man,
4676560	4678840	I trusted her more after that.
4678840	4683200	And I think the moral of that story is both that,
4683200	4686480	yeah, bad therapists suck and should be cut loose
4686480	4690180	and good therapists, you know them when you got them
4690200	4692620	because I was able to tell that story to her.
4692620	4695780	And instead of her being like, what a shitty therapist,
4695780	4697060	holler at your girl.
4697060	4701220	She was like, it's notable that you're telling me
4701220	4704080	that story and it was a pathway for us
4704080	4706300	to deepen our relationship and for her to be able
4706300	4708560	to help me even more because I was able to open
4708560	4711480	even more gateways to her because she earned it
4711480	4714180	by reacting like a human being to that story
4714180	4718100	and communicating her own vulnerabilities and stuff.
4718100	4721020	And so not that you asked for advice or anything
4721020	4723100	and you already know this, but like, yeah,
4723100	4726900	you definitely have like the green light
4726900	4729540	to cut this piece of, he's not a piece of shit.
4729540	4731540	He might be a wonderful therapist.
4731540	4732780	He's like not compatible with you.
4732780	4735100	The thing, yeah, we were talking about that
4735100	4738820	and he was like, well, you seem to have a lot of,
4738820	4740980	what do you call it, like weight put on your looks
4740980	4743780	or you feel like your appearance is messed up.
4743780	4745540	And it's like, well, I feel like that
4745540	4747320	because when I'm at the store,
4747360	4751040	I'm like looking at cereal and then like a kid runs by
4751040	4753660	and then like a mom clutches the kid close
4753660	4756380	and glares at me as they walk off together.
4756380	4758200	Like I was gonna like just reach out
4758200	4760800	and start like molesting that child or something,
4760800	4762280	not even making eye contact.
4762280	4763120	And when that happens-
4763120	4764440	But you're the Van Halen of molestation.
4764440	4768380	Yeah, and when that happens to you enough times,
4768380	4771280	you're like, wow, people must really think
4771280	4772640	I'm like a living monster.
4772640	4775040	Nobody thinks you're a living monster.
4775040	4777240	Certainly the parents who do that to me.
4778160	4780840	And that's their problem.
4780840	4782560	Yeah, no, I agree that's their problem.
4782560	4783400	It's just traumatizing.
4783400	4784720	And it shouldn't be your problem.
4784720	4786760	You don't look like a monster.
4786760	4788320	I do to these people.
4788320	4789160	Come on.
4789160	4790800	At what time I was leaving Dan's house
4790800	4793120	in the middle of the night and just as things-
4793120	4793960	What?
4793960	4795280	Yeah, not in the middle of the night, sorry.
4795280	4796800	It was like at a party or something.
4796800	4799280	It was a while back, but I was like leaving your house
4799280	4801040	and I was getting onto the sidewalk
4801040	4804160	and someone was jogging by like right at the same time.
4805160	4807800	It wasn't like I stepped out in front of them.
4807800	4809440	We kind of just kind of stepped out
4809440	4813040	in roughly the same space and she like screamed.
4813040	4816480	And I was like, I guess I'm just an ogre like this.
4816480	4817960	I'm like Frankenstein.
4817960	4820560	I think she probably, you startled her.
4820560	4822400	I did with my appearance.
4822400	4825920	But I mean, weren't you terrified that she ran by?
4825920	4826760	I mean, like I-
4826760	4829240	I was terrified that that's the effect I have on people.
4829240	4831160	And then I was like, yeah, no, this all tracks.
4831160	4833120	I've walked out of that gate and it's like,
4833120	4835560	it's the physical-
4835560	4836400	There's no line of sight.
4836400	4839480	The situation of it is like every once in a while,
4839480	4843000	like boom, somebody like runs by or walks by with their dog.
4843000	4844280	I fucking freak.
4844280	4845640	I'm Yelp.
4845640	4846840	Yeah, that's what she did.
4846840	4848600	Well, but yeah, but what if those people thought it was
4848600	4850720	because they were ugly or monstrous,
4850720	4851880	they would be so wrong.
4851880	4854400	I was like, there was a physical body like coming by me.
4854400	4855240	My ass is-
4855240	4856360	My ass!
4856360	4857840	Oh, from the stool.
4857840	4860400	Ass fell asleep.
4860400	4861640	Ah, Jesus Christ.
4861640	4862680	Couch isn't bad.
4863600	4864480	Is Jeff still here?
4864480	4865640	I think he left.
4865640	4868000	I think he left his shoes, jacket-
4868000	4868840	That's a good point.
4868840	4871440	He can't really get too far without that stuff.
4871440	4872600	He has his phone though.
4875000	4877400	Why don't we make a new friend?
4877400	4879320	We haven't done that in a long time.
4880640	4884640	Who's somebody that, what do we do?
4884640	4886480	We can't just base it on who wants to be on stage.
4886480	4887800	Those are horrible people.
4888040	4888880	Ah.
4891320	4893680	But inevitably that's what you're picking.
4893680	4896200	It's not like if I say, who's allergic to clovers
4896200	4897880	and someone who doesn't want to be on stage
4897880	4900720	and is richly allergic to clovers,
4900720	4902840	they're gonna not raise their hand.
4902840	4904040	They're critical thinkers.
4906240	4908720	And now they have to be people who are willing
4908720	4911880	to raise their hand after being potentially called out
4911880	4913480	as people who want to be on stage.
4913480	4916000	So that's already gonna be like more fucked up people.
4916000	4918200	Yeah, I think, well, maybe I'm deluded about this,
4918200	4920480	but I think that me doing that kind of actually
4920480	4924360	eases the, like me calling attention to it
4924360	4925560	means that if they raise their hand,
4925560	4927440	then it's like, no, they've thought about it
4927440	4929400	and the audience is like, who's this piece of shit
4929400	4930400	they can watch to be on stage?
4930400	4931920	It's like, I already talked about it.
4931920	4934200	They're aware of the fury.
4934200	4935600	Are you doing any new music?
4935600	4938240	Are you doing any music, new music?
4938240	4940960	I hit this thing, I'm trying to mic my car.
4942760	4945800	I got fucked up neurological problems, man.
4946640	4949240	I get into something that makes me happy
4949240	4951400	and then I fucking like, I just like,
4951400	4953240	I'm like, oh, I gotta, okay, I get it.
4953240	4955280	I gotta mic my car right.
4955280	4957240	Like, so that I can do little raps
4957240	4959360	that were making everyone happy and making me happy.
4959360	4961640	And I'm like, like somewhere in there,
4961640	4964280	just like, I just, I ordered like a million dollars
4964280	4966200	worth of fucking shit that didn't work.
4966200	4968400	And then I was like, I don't know what it is with me.
4968400	4971600	I got my own, I got fucked up shit in my brain.
4971600	4974360	You know, like, that's gonna suck.
4975080	4976960	And then I started playing cookie collector.
4976960	4978640	That's when you know I'm really fucked up.
4978640	4981880	Like, there's a couple of fans that are like
4981880	4985560	on my cookie collector team, which is called Jerry Burry.
4985560	4989440	And they're like, oh shit, Harmon's back.
4989440	4991080	And I'm like, I know what that means.
4991080	4993600	They know that I'm like in some kind of depressive state
4993600	4995200	because it's like, all of a sudden I'm collecting
4995200	4997100	like 30 billion cookies.
4998120	5000120	Guys got two houses, what are you guys doing?
5000120	5002520	I know, it's just, it's just, it's just bio rhythms.
5002520	5003800	I think it's just like a sine wave.
5004440	5005400	I'm not even depressed.
5005400	5006560	It's just sort of like all of a sudden
5006560	5009040	your expression of happiness becomes something else.
5009040	5010600	Like, all of a sudden I'm just collecting cookies.
5010600	5011560	I don't know.
5011560	5013160	Why am I not making a thing?
5013160	5015400	Like, I was like learning software and like,
5015400	5016240	what am I doing now?
5016240	5017240	I was like, I'm collecting cookies.
5017240	5018080	I don't get it.
5019080	5019920	You know?
5019920	5021160	Yeah, I don't get it.
5024360	5027000	Well, we can't call anybody up that,
5029800	5032360	all we talked about was Bagel Boss guy.
5034120	5036000	That almost sounds like BattleBots.
5037240	5039000	Pool robot, pool supply,
5040840	5041680	Polish mole.
5041680	5043000	There's nobody here that's like,
5043000	5045200	like that knows about skin tags
5045200	5047040	and Polish moles kind of thing, is there anything?
5047040	5048280	Not the cancer mice.
5048280	5050720	The cancer mice, I'm sure.
5050720	5053320	Can you shout out your expertise?
5053320	5056160	Are you covered in them or are you a dermatologist or?
5059640	5060480	Holy shit.
5060480	5062560	Would you like to come up here and if we,
5062600	5064680	if we force you to and you have the excuse
5064680	5067280	that we force you to and everyone knows you're a good person
5067280	5069640	and you're not, you're not just, yeah.
5070640	5071480	I know.
5071480	5072760	Aw, see, now everyone will love you.
5072760	5073600	Yeah, peace.
5074720	5075560	Come on up.
5076560	5077400	Have a seat.
5078720	5079880	Hello.
5079880	5080800	Hi, what's your name?
5080800	5081640	Hello.
5081640	5082600	Jeff.
5082600	5083440	Jack. Jack.
5083440	5084280	Jack.
5084280	5085120	Close enough, close enough.
5085120	5086400	How do you become a researcher?
5086400	5088200	Oh, by the way, Jack.
5088200	5089040	Jack, Jack.
5089040	5089880	I just remembered something.
5089880	5091160	And you're wearing a Jack head.
5091200	5094600	Who are the guys that walk past me on the,
5094600	5097040	oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
5097040	5099040	You're gonna knock over the Jeff Gollum.
5099040	5101760	Damn it, this fucking show.
5101760	5103480	I just, every week I wanna quit
5103480	5106640	and then I give it one more chance and then shrub.
5107640	5109520	Who are the guys that walk past on the sidewalk
5109520	5111000	when I was coming in?
5111000	5112400	You guys here?
5112400	5113480	Okay, yeah.
5113480	5116040	You didn't take that, like,
5116040	5120120	I felt like I accidentally offended you guys.
5120120	5121600	Okay, because I did a thing,
5121600	5123600	it was like kind of like when I,
5123600	5125400	the first time I met Seth Rogen,
5126320	5131160	it was like, we were walking on a lot of some kind
5131160	5134440	and there was someone I was with that like knew Seth Rogen
5134440	5138760	and he was like, hey, Seth, it's me so-and-so,
5138760	5141240	or whatever, and Seth Rogen had the,
5141240	5144160	he was like, had this like Seth Rogen chuckle,
5144160	5145760	but I was like, well, yeah, I knew,
5145760	5147640	I knew when I saw you guys walking toward me,
5147640	5150000	I was like, well, these guys are probably fans of mine.
5150800	5152920	Like it was like, and it was kind of an endearing thing
5152920	5154400	and it was kind of like in the moment,
5154400	5157000	I was sort of like, because I saw you guys coming
5157000	5158440	and then you were like smirking at me
5158440	5160040	because you were walking past me
5160040	5161960	and then I had a moment to think about it
5161960	5162920	and then you guys were like,
5162920	5164040	we're coming to see your show
5164040	5165560	and I blurted something like,
5165560	5167200	yeah, well, you look like it or something.
5167200	5172200	It was, and I really didn't,
5174920	5177140	I'm not good at talking.
5178140	5181980	Welcome Jack, okay, how do you become a researcher?
5181980	5183140	Do you have to do science?
5183140	5184980	Yeah, I got in it after college.
5184980	5188980	I was, I studied organic chemistry in college.
5188980	5192140	And I was working as an organic chemist in a research lab
5192140	5194460	and then I got hired in a, yeah.
5194460	5195300	That's cool.
5196140	5201140	So like, all right, so what do you know about this?
5201780	5204620	This.
5205900	5207140	Maybe you should touch it.
5207140	5208980	That's an M4 class C.
5208980	5210060	Neither of us want that.
5210060	5212340	No, no, no, just like, give it a little twiddle.
5212340	5214340	Just so you can, let it.
5214340	5215820	I'll touch it if you want me to.
5215820	5216980	No, you don't have to touch it.
5216980	5217820	I want you to touch it.
5217820	5219580	I'm not concerned about it or worried about it.
5219580	5220900	I think you should touch it, right?
5220900	5221740	You should be.
5222740	5224900	Rob, it's not important.
5224900	5226780	It's entertaining to the people.
5226780	5228660	No, it's doesn't, it's not important.
5228660	5231660	It's a, okay.
5231660	5233900	They have a normal life cycle.
5233900	5235900	They grow and they fall off generally.
5235900	5238100	What are they on a cellular level?
5239340	5241260	They're just epithelial tissue.
5242220	5245820	Like in terms of like, is it related to cancer?
5245820	5247660	Like, is it a phenomenon like cancer,
5247660	5248660	but it's just like not.
5248660	5250220	Yeah, so they're called like a nevus,
5250220	5252740	which is like a form for skin lesion.
5252740	5256500	And which is just another word for a mole
5256500	5257380	or something like that.
5257420	5259180	They're not technically.
5259180	5261660	How come some cells can go crazy
5261660	5263100	and start just making more of themselves
5263100	5266300	and you get like a blemish, like a mole or a skin tag
5266300	5269100	or, and like, how come, how come,
5269100	5271780	how come sometimes that's just like a thing that's contained
5271780	5275060	and it just like falls off or isn't, isn't worrisome?
5275060	5278740	And then what, what, why is that?
5278740	5281940	Why isn't it a zero sum game if a cell has lost its mind
5281940	5283420	and is just making more of itself?
5283420	5286620	Like, why, why do some of them just stop and make a mole?
5286700	5289260	And some of them become a tumor that kills you.
5289260	5292140	So it turns out that like mutations
5292140	5293940	are required to make cancer
5293940	5296020	and mutations happen all the time.
5296020	5299740	They happen every time your skin cells get hit with sunlight.
5299740	5304660	They happen every time you interact with toxic chemicals.
5304660	5307860	And a lot of those mutations are harmless.
5307860	5311060	And in fact, it takes sometimes hundreds of mutations
5311060	5312820	or, or thousands of mutations
5312820	5315140	to make something into a cancer.
5315140	5317820	And what you almost sound like you're saying
5317820	5319940	that the things that are benign,
5319940	5321540	that grow on the surface of our skin,
5321540	5324420	that those aren't the result of mutations?
5324420	5327780	They can definitely be the result of mutations.
5327780	5332780	There's a genetic component to things that grow on your skin.
5333060	5335580	Nevi, as they're called, are moles or skin tags.
5336540	5337980	And the genetic component.
5337980	5340540	So some people, especially white people,
5340540	5344420	have up to hundreds of moles on their body
5344420	5346620	and some people don't have very many at all.
5352140	5352980	I'm also one of those people.
5352980	5356900	This is the most harmless form of white supremacy
5356900	5357740	I've ever heard.
5358660	5360940	I never, I never knew I could get behind
5360940	5364340	any form of white supremacy until a guy went, whoop,
5364340	5369340	to do skin tags being prevalent.
5371940	5372900	Yeah, oh, wow.
5372900	5375020	I mean, gosh, yeah, I feel like, like, thank you,
5375020	5376340	but you're like a dream.
5376340	5379380	Like, wait, wait, I want to plug your album or something.
5379380	5380780	I mean, you're like, you're, you're,
5380780	5383660	you're being so like, like fucking straight forward.
5383660	5386420	So anti-shrob, I call it, you're just being so anti-shrob.
5386420	5387900	Do you see Chernobyl?
5389460	5390860	I haven't seen Chernobyl.
5390860	5393140	Oh, it might be a nightmare for you,
5393140	5395300	because you're like, oh, I know exactly what's happening
5395300	5396140	to that guy's face.
5396140	5398620	Yeah, yeah, you should watch Chernobyl.
5398620	5402740	It's really, it's really, people are really liking it.
5403460	5404460	They're thinking it's great.
5404460	5406740	You should watch Chernobyl.
5406740	5409460	Did, do you have Chernobyl?
5410780	5411820	Do you have Chernobyl?
5411820	5412660	At home?
5412660	5413500	You don't have to.
5413500	5414540	Do you have it at home?
5414540	5417380	I grew up with Chernobyl, yeah.
5417380	5418820	Right, right.
5418820	5420660	It happened to all of us.
5420660	5423700	Did it, what kind of a lifespan did it happen?
5423700	5424900	Did it fall off?
5427900	5428820	Long.
5428820	5430380	Okay, so important question.
5430380	5431380	I don't ignore me.
5432220	5434900	So when one of these things is growing on our eyelids
5434900	5436820	or our arms dangling off, and like,
5436820	5440540	so what about this science that I've had
5440540	5441620	programmed into me, I was like,
5441620	5443820	I'm not supposed to do anything to this.
5443820	5445420	I've heard people tell anecdotes about,
5445420	5448580	I went to my general doctor, he brought out a scalpel
5448580	5451700	and sliced it right off after I worried about it
5451700	5453860	for six months, he's like, who gives a shit?
5453860	5455780	And then other people go, don't touch it,
5455780	5456860	don't fuck with it.
5456860	5459660	Like if you pull it off, it'll,
5459660	5461620	it's like, it becomes cancer.
5461620	5464300	Is there any truth or reasoning?
5464300	5467180	The vast majority will not become cancer.
5467180	5470260	Is there any reason why people would think that?
5470260	5473180	There's, I mean, with every, so,
5473180	5475980	one part of a possible life cycle of an EVIS
5475980	5479780	is to accumulate enough mutations to become cancer.
5479780	5483220	And whether you, and so maybe pulling it off
5483220	5486620	is simply encouraging it to grow more.
5486620	5489100	Like pruning a tree, in which case,
5489100	5491420	if it was gonna eventually become cancer,
5491420	5493820	you're just giving it a kind of a boost.
5493820	5497220	So the worry with cancer isn't so much that it's gonna grow,
5497220	5499260	it's gonna metastasize, it's gonna spread
5499260	5502020	to your other tissues and it's gonna cause them to shut down.
5502020	5503620	Especially your major organs.
5503620	5504940	Wait, what's the, say that again,
5504940	5507500	because that's the definition of a really important cancer.
5507500	5510380	So metastasize means, say that again.
5510380	5513780	Yeah, so the worry with cancer is that
5513780	5515340	it's going to become metastatic.
5515340	5517460	It's gonna be able to move through things
5517460	5520220	like your bloodstream or your lymph into other tissues.
5520220	5523020	Not that, well, so cancer can't just kill you
5523020	5525780	by just like, I'm a little piece of bone
5525780	5526900	that decides it's not a bone,
5526900	5528980	I'm gonna grow into a big ball of bone.
5528980	5531020	The problem is that it actually spreads
5531020	5532820	to like lymph nodes and whatever.
5532820	5534780	I wanna kind of add the disclaimer that,
5534780	5536460	I answered this question to the best of my ability,
5536460	5537660	but I'm also not a doctor.
5537660	5540020	I'm just someone who goes in and research.
5540020	5542300	You also said, you also said, excuse me, Dan,
5542300	5543940	you also said you weren't a good person.
5543940	5545220	Explain yourself.
5545220	5549900	I guess I'm on stage, so in some way,
5549900	5551580	I wanted to be here and I don't know that,
5551580	5553780	I guess that doesn't make me a good person or a bad person.
5553780	5554620	I mean, wow.
5554620	5555460	I mean, yeah.
5555460	5556300	We're all bad people.
5556300	5560180	It's a constant paradox, it's a Taoist principle.
5560180	5562020	Like if you thought you were a good person,
5562020	5563340	you'd be a shitty person.
5563340	5564980	You gotta think you're a bad person.
5564980	5567220	That's your only recourse to being a good person.
5567220	5570860	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5570860	5572940	And I went and said, yeah, are you,
5572940	5575740	are there, some of the people who are watching
5575740	5577740	through subscription who are seeing your face
5577740	5580860	are probably wondering like, dermatology research,
5580860	5581980	are you like cheating?
5581980	5584500	Like, do you like, are there astringents
5584500	5586180	at the office and things?
5586180	5587780	Cause you have very nice skin
5587780	5590740	and I'm not hitting on you, but like you're.
5590740	5591700	I thank you.
5591700	5594500	I actually, it's one thing I'm self-conscious about
5594500	5597900	is my skin, which is weird maybe to hear you say that.
5597900	5599140	What are you worried about?
5599140	5599980	I don't know.
5600620	5602820	You're very handsome.
5602820	5606540	Stop it, stop it, stop it.
5606540	5608660	Everyone under 40, by the way,
5608660	5612460	is just wonderful looking to me now.
5612460	5616820	I just look and I see everyone as like non piles of bones
5617780	5619220	and I go, hubba hubba.
5619220	5621900	To answer your original question.
5621900	5622740	Uh.
5623420	5626420	What's your favorite kind of answer?
5626420	5629420	Let him answer, let him answer.
5629420	5630260	Sunburns.
5630260	5631100	Let him answer.
5631100	5631940	Everybody.
5631940	5633780	Sunburns, you couldn't come into the laboratory
5633780	5637420	with a sunburn, that would be, you would, yeah.
5637420	5639780	My boss would tear my head off if I came in with a sunburn.
5639780	5642100	Oh, like, well, okay, well, tell me a little bit about that,
5642100	5642940	cause I don't know.
5642940	5643780	I don't know.
5643780	5644620	I don't know.
5644620	5645460	I don't know.
5645460	5646300	I don't know.
5646300	5647140	I don't know.
5647140	5647980	I don't know.
5647980	5648820	I don't know.
5648820	5649660	I don't know.
5649660	5650500	I don't know.
5650500	5651340	I don't know.
5651500	5652620	Well, tell me a little bit about that.
5652620	5656420	Cause I'm a very, like a very, very cockazoid,
5656420	5658180	like guy that just got a pool.
5658180	5662820	And like, I'm, I'm, I got a lot of British DNA
5662820	5665380	and I'm like, I turned pink fast.
5665380	5666580	I peel fast.
5666580	5670820	Like, I, like what, I don't understand sunscreen.
5670820	5672580	I don't understand.
5672580	5673900	I don't even know what to ask you.
5673900	5676300	I wish you could just tell me something to make me not worry.
5676300	5678020	Cause I feel like I'm,
5678020	5679900	people are always telling me, put on sunscreen.
5679900	5682380	I definitely tell you something to make you not worry.
5682380	5683220	Okay.
5683220	5684060	I don't know.
5684060	5684900	That'd be true.
5684900	5685980	You should definitely worry.
5685980	5686820	Oh.
5690020	5690860	Yeah, let's hear it.
5690860	5691700	Okay.
5691700	5692540	I like that honesty.
5692540	5693380	Yeah, tell him.
5693380	5695100	You're saying I could lie to you.
5695100	5695940	Yeah.
5695940	5696780	But you, all right.
5696780	5697600	Well, don't.
5697600	5698440	I don't want you to.
5698440	5701060	I think the coolest thing about sun tanning actually
5701060	5704140	is that it's my favorite fact about skin really
5704140	5706340	is that sunlight.
5706340	5707180	Yeah.
5707180	5708580	I guess I'm a nerd.
5708580	5711060	Sunlight, in order to tan,
5711060	5713060	you actually have to damage the DNA.
5713060	5716720	Tanning is a direct response to like getting DNA damage.
5716720	5718740	Sunlight actually comes in and it mutates
5718740	5720980	or destroys parts of your DNA.
5720980	5724300	And then your cells respond by producing pigment.
5724300	5727440	And they produce these little shields like in your skin,
5727440	5732440	melanoma or melanin actually produces a little shield.
5732440	5735700	Like if you look at a skin cell under a microscope,
5735700	5738020	it'll be, there'll be like a little shield of melanin
5738020	5740380	over the nucleus where the DNA is held.
5740380	5741500	So melanin is what?
5741500	5743220	It's like, I think you just told me,
5743220	5748220	but it's a coating around a cell membrane?
5749300	5750140	Yeah, it's a pigment.
5750140	5753820	So it's like a small molecule as opposed to like a protein
5753820	5754660	or something.
5754660	5756520	Is it itself?
5756520	5759580	It's not, it's, I'm trying to picture like,
5759580	5761140	like remember in high school,
5761140	5763020	they showed us like a cross section of skin
5763020	5764860	and it's like, okay, there's like all these layers.
5764860	5767180	So like is melanin like a chemical
5767180	5770100	that exists somewhere in one of those layers that like.
5770100	5772540	Oh man, this is a lot, gonna be a lot of science.
5774380	5778020	So melanin is produced in the melanocyte
5778020	5780260	is a special type of cell specifically
5780260	5782420	for producing melanin.
5782420	5784580	A totally special cell.
5784580	5787340	Yeah, it's in the basal layer of the skin.
5787340	5792340	So the skin has like a lot of other types of cells in it.
5792340	5794380	One of them is the melanocyte.
5794380	5796300	They have these like special tendrils
5796860	5798860	that are like.
5798860	5800260	Pumping out melanin.
5800260	5802620	Pumping out melanin and they actually like ship it off
5802620	5804820	to all your other cells and give it to the cells
5804820	5806180	so that the cells can protect themselves.
5806180	5808460	And the cells coat themselves in it?
5808460	5811020	No, they just produce like a productive shield
5811020	5813060	over the nucleus.
5813060	5813900	Oh, just the nucleus?
5813900	5815140	Just the nucleus, yeah.
5815140	5815980	Oh wow.
5815980	5817020	Yeah, which is pretty cool.
5817020	5817860	That's my favorite thing about it.
5817860	5818900	That is cool.
5818900	5819740	I thought so.
5819740	5821020	God damn.
5821020	5822700	I love fucking biology.
5823660	5828660	Yeah, and so our emphasis on like pigmentation
5829100	5832460	with as we, you know, eight billion of us
5832460	5833700	are all like mad at each other.
5833700	5835180	We're looking at each other on Facebook
5835180	5836820	and we're like recognizing each other
5836820	5839100	as being from different parts of the world and things.
5839100	5841020	Like all of it really comes down to like
5841020	5842060	these shades and things.
5842060	5845020	And so the melanin is like a,
5845020	5849340	so there's like if your genetic heritage comes from a part
5849340	5851340	where there's being beaten by the sun,
5851980	5853940	then those melanites.
5853940	5855100	Melanocytes.
5855100	5856420	Melanocytes.
5856420	5857700	Alanis.
5857700	5858540	More sun.
5858540	5859780	Melanocytes.
5859780	5862820	I'm going to make you all of complexion.
5868300	5871100	They're just pumping out different degrees of sunscreen,
5871100	5874180	like which probably comes at a metabolic cost, right?
5874180	5875020	That's correct.
5875020	5876780	Actually both of those things, yeah.
5877780	5882780	And so white people are at much higher risk of skin cancer
5885060	5888460	than people that have like more melanin like black.
5888460	5890940	I guess it's just natural, sun's the,
5890940	5894900	because your nucleus is exposed to the sun.
5894900	5897460	Yes, although anyone can get skin cancer.
5897460	5898300	Right, right, right.
5898300	5900540	Not to say, yeah, I'm not telling anyone to go.
5900540	5901380	What about Brad?
5902220	5903060	Say again.
5903060	5904220	What about Brad?
5904860	5905980	Br, what?
5907420	5908540	Just a friend of yours?
5908540	5910380	Yeah, could he get skin cancer?
5911660	5913460	Does he ever go in the sun?
5913460	5915100	Oh yeah, he's Brad.
5915100	5916540	Oh.
5916540	5917380	I kind of wonder.
5917380	5918220	Yeah, Brad.
5918220	5919060	Brad.
5919060	5920340	It's like these mutate,
5920340	5924180	so like the thing that's hanging off of my arm,
5924180	5927500	which may or may not fall off, it'll pick its own time.
5927500	5930500	But it's an expression of my genetic code
5930500	5933260	as a person that's descended from East Europeans
5933260	5936180	and British people, and it's a part of my skin
5936180	5938020	that's going like, oh, this is a good place
5938020	5940020	for like a random fucking cuato,
5940020	5941660	like to just like blossom off.
5941660	5944260	And even though it's not mutation-based,
5944260	5946380	it is long-term mutation-based in the sense
5946380	5948180	that parents are shuffling their genes
5948180	5949620	every time they make a baby,
5949620	5951540	and then we're all carrying over
5951540	5954500	these like weird random experiments in our DNA,
5954500	5956100	and some of those experiments will say like,
5956100	5957500	this person should have this color eyes,
5957500	5959540	or this person should have like this dorsal fin
5959540	5962180	or gills or something that might come in handy,
5962220	5966740	but like my DNA includes all this like static that's like,
5966740	5969420	and by the way, have a little like porcupine come off
5969420	5971420	of his arm when he's 46,
5971420	5976420	and like it has in its own way, it's a function.
5976420	5978740	It would only have a function if it was,
5978740	5982660	in the sense of emergence, if over time,
5984220	5986860	wouldn't it ultimately could lead to,
5986860	5989620	if there was a chance that having that thing on my arm
5989620	5991580	led to my DNA?
5992460	5995500	If everyone found that incredibly hot,
5995500	5998060	and not having a thing dangling off your arm
5998060	6000540	was like gross, get him away from me,
6000540	6004180	and then would this pass to my children,
6004180	6007420	like growing it on the same spot on my arm?
6009540	6010380	No.
6010380	6011820	Okay.
6011820	6013340	Yeah, you're asking basically,
6013340	6015180	is there a selection pressure,
6015180	6018060	an evolutionary selection pressure on things like skin tags?
6018060	6020380	That's exactly what he's asking.
6020380	6022300	I'm also asking like to the extent
6022300	6025140	that it's a function of my DNA,
6025140	6028300	is it, yeah, is it hereditary?
6028300	6029860	But it's hereditary to have them,
6029860	6031820	but is it hereditary to the location of them?
6031820	6036780	Location wise, there's probably predisposed places
6036780	6038980	on people's bodies where they're more likely to occur.
6038980	6043020	Just like if your mom and dad both have one on their eyelid
6043020	6046660	when they're 25 and both of them grow and fall off,
6046660	6048820	but and then they have a kid together,
6048820	6052700	is that kid more likely to have a skin tag on their eyelid,
6052700	6054420	or just more likely to have skin tags?
6054420	6057300	I'm definitely not qualified to answer that question,
6057300	6058460	but doubtful.
6058460	6059300	All right.
6059300	6061660	Well, Jesus Christ, what a fucking podcast.
6061660	6062980	Well, if you're so smart,
6062980	6065060	you tell us about the Jewish golem.
6066500	6069060	What do you know about the Jewish golem?
6069060	6070980	What's it powered by?
6070980	6072260	What kind of magic?
6072260	6075740	Yeah, which magic?
6075740	6078740	I can probably confirm that it's not skin tag magic.
6079060	6080780	And our skin related magic.
6080780	6081620	Thank you.
6081620	6084180	Do you live here in LA or are you visiting?
6084180	6085020	I'm visiting.
6085020	6086340	Oh, who are you visiting?
6086340	6089300	Well, tell me when I'm prying.
6089300	6090140	Who am I visiting?
6090140	6090980	Yeah, why are you here?
6090980	6091820	My sister.
6091820	6092660	Your sister?
6092660	6093500	Yeah.
6093500	6094340	That's wholesome.
6094340	6095180	Thank you.
6095180	6096020	Stop hitting on him.
6100580	6101860	Is she?
6104500	6105940	Of marriageable age?
6105940	6106940	Does she have a brother?
6106940	6107780	No.
6109740	6113980	I was going to say, is she an older sister or a kid sister?
6113980	6115660	And then I was like, I don't even know how old you are.
6115660	6118180	And then I was like, can you ask anyone's age anymore?
6118180	6120380	I always want to know how old everyone is.
6120380	6121700	28.
6121700	6122540	Fuck you.
6124300	6125940	So is she your kid sister here?
6125940	6126940	No, she's older than I am.
6126940	6127860	She's 30.
6127860	6130100	And is she here?
6130100	6131300	No, she's not.
6134220	6135460	What a nice family.
6136020	6138780	Did you visit your sister?
6139900	6140740	Yes.
6140740	6141580	What's it like to...
6141580	6143340	Yeah, yeah, what's it like?
6143340	6146180	Where are you from originally?
6146180	6148140	I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area.
6148140	6150380	Okay, not that much of a trek.
6150380	6152020	I heard a yoop.
6152020	6152860	We've got a yoop.
6154780	6159140	And you sound like you sidled into this dermatological
6159140	6161540	research part of your organic chemistry.
6161540	6163380	Like, are you...
6163420	6168020	Do you have dreams that overflow that cup?
6168020	6169340	Like, you ended up there.
6169340	6171420	Are you happy there or is there a ladder?
6171420	6172780	No, I left there actually.
6172780	6174780	I feel like I'm kind of in Shrobs position
6174780	6176500	where I'm kind of like, what the fuck?
6176500	6177580	I don't know what the fuck.
6177580	6178660	You've hit a crossroads.
6178660	6179500	You're like, what am I doing?
6179500	6181140	You're fucking lucky, man.
6181140	6185380	So you're basically a 28 year old dude with flawless skin.
6185380	6186740	Are you happy now?
6186740	6188180	You're in the same fucking boat.
6188180	6189020	Thank you.
6189020	6194020	So stop fucking doing what we used to call bitching
6195380	6196620	before the Me Too movement.
6196620	6197460	I didn't bitch.
6197460	6199780	I didn't, I'm not bitching.
6199780	6200780	Well, don't repeat it.
6205780	6207540	Have you been Me Too'd?
6207540	6209060	Not, no.
6209060	6213140	It's like a chemical peel.
6213140	6214140	It's amazing.
6215340	6217340	It just leaves you, it hurts at first,
6217340	6218820	but then it's like, oh my God.
6221820	6223220	It sounds uncomfortable.
6224580	6225580	Oh, yeah.
6225580	6228580	Well, you should see the other guy.
6237700	6239260	All right, let's do, okay.
6239260	6244260	You know how we, so we're gonna do a little game here.
6244580	6248140	We're gonna do a little game here, Jack,
6248140	6251140	and it's called Life Crossroads.
6255260	6260260	It's an improv game that Rob Schwab and I do,
6260380	6264500	where we take you back to a point in your life
6264500	6269580	where you're wondering, like you're thinking,
6269580	6271980	what if I had chosen this instead of that?
6272980	6275500	Can you conjure that moment in your head?
6275500	6278180	And what we will do is revisit that moment.
6278180	6280020	That sounds like a terrible idea.
6281460	6285380	So the things would be dermatology or anything else?
6285380	6286900	Sure, or anything.
6286900	6288420	You could also go back to eight years old
6288420	6291140	and be like, what if I had taken piano?
6291140	6295940	Whatever you think is a really crucial branch in your life
6295940	6299020	where you're like, I really wish I could know at least
6299020	6301500	and check in on who I would have been
6301660	6303340	if I had done this instead of that.
6306380	6307540	I know there's a lot of pressure,
6307540	6310540	and I can give you a couple minutes to order.
6310540	6313860	I think I don't know what I would have done differently.
6313860	6315580	At one point, I wanted to be an engineer.
6315580	6317420	I don't think that's significantly different
6317420	6320700	from like a research scientist.
6320700	6323580	But I don't think I remember that question.
6323580	6325020	One writes a choo-choo train.
6325020	6325980	Yeah, I suppose.
6325980	6327700	It's so different.
6327700	6329300	I wouldn't want, if I was on a train,
6329300	6332220	I wouldn't want the guy making it go choo-choo
6332220	6334660	to know a lot about skin.
6336660	6337500	Okay, all right.
6337500	6338340	That's a good point.
6338340	6340380	See, dad humor, it's fun.
6344300	6345140	Come on.
6345140	6346460	All right, no, no, I'm sorry.
6346460	6348060	I'm not lashing out again.
6348060	6351420	I think that Crossroads is like right now in my life.
6351420	6352260	Right, okay.
6352260	6354460	I think I can look back in 10 years
6354460	6357460	and be like, what if I hadn't been in this case?
6357460	6360740	So tell us like a kind of dilemma you have,
6360740	6363700	if you don't mind, of like,
6363700	6366380	what's like a radical decision that you think
6366380	6368860	is on the table that you're,
6368860	6371020	because you're a logical guy and you're like,
6371020	6373860	oh, I would never maybe do that, but like.
6373860	6375300	Like I would never do standup,
6375300	6376980	but like at this point in my life,
6376980	6380740	I would like think about putting myself in that position.
6380740	6382540	And being on stage here is like one of those things
6382540	6384500	where I'm kind of like, well,
6384500	6385900	do something I'm uncomfortable with.
6385900	6389140	So we should show you then what your life would be like
6389140	6390500	if you, okay, right.
6390500	6391340	You hear that, Shab?
6391340	6392620	Okay, so here we go.
6392620	6393460	So enjoy.
6401740	6406140	What if Jack had done standup
6407300	6410660	instead of dermatological research?
6411740	6415260	Okay, welcome to the comedy hut.
6416140	6417820	Tonight on the comedy hut.
6417820	6419740	Okay, come on people, keep it going.
6419740	6420620	This ain't easy.
6420620	6423540	Ellen DeGeneres, Chris Rock.
6423540	6425260	My name is Ellen DeGeneres.
6425260	6427260	And Jack.
6430780	6435780	Apparently somebody's on stage during the intro.
6436420	6439500	Let's give it up for Ellen DeGeneres,
6439500	6442300	who just said Ellen DeGeneres.
6442300	6443700	Here we go.
6443740	6444740	Yeah, it's okay.
6444740	6447060	Put your hands together.
6447060	6448500	Who's there?
6448500	6450180	Here's Ellen DeGeneres.
6450180	6451820	My name is Ellen DeGeneres.
6451820	6452900	Hi, Ellen.
6458300	6463300	I'm not used to this format of show.
6463300	6464500	You're doing great.
6464500	6468860	But I have a few jokes prepared that I would like to do.
6473700	6478700	It would seem that a man walked into a bar
6481100	6483780	in an auspicious time.
6485180	6486340	Shit.
6487620	6489060	I can't do it.
6489060	6490300	Boo, get off the street.
6490300	6493300	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
6493300	6496460	Meanwhile, all right, go ahead with the narration.
6496460	6497300	Oh.
6499020	6501780	What are you, are you a guy, are you a character in the,
6502780	6507780	I was the emcee, but I don't have to.
6507900	6509540	Of the standup show?
6509540	6512140	Of the comedy hut that I introduced?
6512140	6514140	No, it's during the show, okay, all right.
6514140	6515340	What?
6515340	6516180	Go ahead.
6516180	6517860	Meanwhile, backstage, you said.
6522900	6527620	Jeez, I heard, I heard Ellen died out there.
6529460	6530780	It's not encouraging.
6531500	6535140	I have a feeling she's a better standup comic
6535140	6537460	than whoever would follow Ellen on her own show.
6537460	6538540	Yeah, she's very experienced.
6538540	6541620	I mean, for her to eat it out there is very scary.
6541620	6542940	It's her own audience.
6542940	6546860	My name is David Spade.
6550140	6553900	I also am a veteran comic and I'm very scared
6553900	6556340	based on what I just heard out there.
6556340	6558860	Your name's Jack.
6559860	6561300	Yes.
6561300	6562140	Okay.
6567660	6569260	All right, okay, all right.
6570580	6574660	All right, we only have time for one comedy space
6574660	6576740	so we're gonna have to have two comics
6576740	6578980	go up at the same time.
6578980	6582780	So will Jack and David Spade please report
6582780	6585380	to the front of the stage, may I repeat,
6585380	6587580	the front of the stage, not the back
6587580	6589340	or either left or right.
6589340	6591260	Are you cool with this?
6591260	6592740	Reporting to the front of the stage.
6592740	6594180	It doesn't sound like we have a choice.
6594180	6595540	The front of the stage, here we go.
6595540	6597060	All right, okay.
6597060	6598780	Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time
6598780	6601620	only at the Comedy Hut, it's David Spade and Jack.
6601620	6605140	Bring it up, bring it up, bring it up.
6605140	6609380	Bring up the levels of laughter and clapping.
6610380	6615380	Uh, look, the two of us don't like airline food.
6619060	6621660	It fucking is David Spade.
6621660	6622820	Fuck your name, it's Spade.
6622820	6623660	Shut up.
6625260	6626700	Your last name's a shovel.
6628860	6632820	It doesn't matter, I can't, I can't do this.
6635380	6638420	I'm definitely a lot worse than a famous comic
6638420	6643420	at this, dude, I prepared zero material.
6645580	6647500	You have to, you have nothing?
6649060	6652740	Shovel name, shut up, shovel name.
6652740	6654020	Look, shovel name.
6654020	6657220	I got, uh, shovel name.
6658300	6660300	Look, we're just, look, shovel name.
6660300	6665060	We're gonna have to do improv in the show.
6666500	6667340	Okay.
6667420	6668740	Bring it back.
6668740	6670940	I'd like a suggestion.
6670940	6675940	My name's Lauren Michaels and my suggestion is tennis.
6678460	6683180	Oh fuck, the stakes just got so high.
6683180	6685020	Wait, what was his suggestion?
6685020	6690020	Tennis, tennis, tennis, tennis, what?
6690100	6691540	Tennis, tennis?
6691540	6693140	Tennis is a suggestion.
6694140	6695700	High stakes tennis, okay.
6696700	6698700	Right, ting, ting, ting.
6701260	6702100	Hello.
6702100	6705580	Thanks for meeting me out here on this tennis court.
6705580	6706420	Yeah.
6707860	6708700	Yeah.
6710700	6715620	Fucking jacket, jacket rules, jacket, fucking rules.
6715620	6718460	Oh, I got, well, must be nice, goddamn it.
6718460	6722660	All right, well, let's get started playing tennis.
6722660	6723700	All right, coach.
6726420	6729500	Hey, hey, hey, yeah, you're the coach.
6729500	6730820	Fucking shovel name.
6733460	6735620	Coach, how about one of your classic life lessons
6735620	6737460	during a match of tennis?
6743540	6744860	This guy's pimping me.
6746140	6748820	It's called pimping, it's a thing.
6748820	6752820	All right, yeah, yes, and I'll give you that.
6753820	6758820	Give you that if you, when I give you the life lesson,
6759820	6762820	you say thank you in a Jamaican accent.
6762820	6763820	I mean, how do you like it?
6763820	6764820	How do you like it?
6765820	6767820	That's what you did, that's basically what you did.
6769820	6770820	Not cool, not cool.
6770820	6773820	I don't think I'm in the mood for a life lesson today.
6773820	6774820	Oh.
6774820	6775820	Anyways.
6775820	6776820	Okay, all right, well.
6776820	6779820	So maybe just serve it up and we'll get a workout in.
6779820	6780820	Okay.
6780820	6781820	Something.
6781820	6782820	All right.
6796820	6797820	Good shot, coach.
6797820	6798820	Oh, did I?
6798820	6799820	Okay.
6799820	6800820	I missed that last one.
6800820	6801820	Did I win?
6801820	6802820	I won.
6802820	6803820	Yeah.
6803820	6804820	So we have to lift on that one.
6804820	6805820	That's why you're the coach.
6805820	6808820	Well, you know, I won, so I guess I jump over the net.
6811820	6814820	The skin on my leg is damaged.
6817820	6821820	Good thing that before I decided to learn tennis,
6821820	6824820	I learned about how to undamaged skin.
6824820	6826820	You know about skin.
6826820	6828820	Only damaged skin.
6828820	6831820	But you're such a good tennis player in the scene
6831820	6833820	we're improvising as standups.
6834820	6836820	You know about, don't help me.
6836820	6838820	It hurt my real life skin hurts.
6838820	6841820	Because while I was playing a tennis player in this
6841820	6843820	improv scene at the standup club,
6843820	6845820	I also actually as a comedic performer,
6845820	6848820	David Spade hurt my real David Spade skin.
6849820	6852820	Help me, Jack.
6852820	6855820	It looks hurt.
6856820	6859820	If I were a doctor, I might be able to help,
6859820	6862820	but I could probably just tell you why it's hurt,
6862820	6866820	which is that you trauma to the leg.
6866820	6867820	You're right.
6868820	6872820	And that gives me the confidence to finish my set.
6874820	6877820	Y'all notice that women be shopping?
6882820	6885820	David Spade went on to become a famous comedian,
6885820	6888820	entertaining millions of people and launching his own
6888820	6891820	franchise, Spade in America and SNL.
6892820	6896820	Jack learned that his true calling,
6896820	6898820	no matter what field he went into,
6898820	6901820	would always be to know more about skin
6901820	6904820	than people who did it.
6904820	6908820	And so it turned out good.
6908820	6910820	It turned out that your life is good.
6910820	6913820	I'm pretty sure I started this by saying that
6913820	6917820	the last thing I wanted was to learn more about skin.
6917820	6919820	Right.
6919820	6921820	So definitely good is not how I feel
6921820	6923820	about the rest of my life at this stage.
6923820	6925820	You're right.
6925820	6929820	But I guess there's a hopeful future in there somewhere.
6929820	6930820	Yeah.
6930820	6933820	I mean, there might be comfort taken in the idea that
6933820	6934820	you're trapped.
6934820	6936820	You're trapped in your life.
6936820	6937820	Right.
6937820	6938820	Yeah.
6938820	6939820	Like, there's a lot of people listening that are like,
6939820	6942820	yeah, I wish I could choose to not work at Home Depot.
6945820	6946820	What are you doing?
6946820	6947820	What is that?
6948820	6949820	Okay.
6949820	6950820	We've done more than enough shows.
6950820	6952820	We're doing some atmosphere.
6953820	6954820	All right.
6954820	6955820	I'm going to do a skin.
6955820	6956820	Hey.
6956820	6957820	Hey.
6957820	6958820	Hey.
6958820	6960820	Doesn't my voice sound different?
6960820	6961820	Yeah.
6961820	6964820	Did you hear my voice?
6964820	6965820	Dan.
6965820	6966820	Yeah.
6966820	6967820	Dan.
6967820	6968820	I don't know how to end shows though.
6968820	6969820	We'll do a dermatology rap.
6969820	6970820	Here we go.
6970820	6971820	Come on.
6971820	6972820	All right.
6972820	6973820	Yeah.
6973820	6974820	Yeah.
6974820	6975820	Yeah.
6975820	6976820	Yeah.
6976820	6977820	Yeah.
6977820	6978820	Yeah.
6978820	6979820	Yeah.
6979820	6980820	Yeah.
6980820	6981820	Yeah.
6981820	6982820	You can't stop.
6982820	6983820	You're going to be nervous.
6983820	6984820	By lipid, by a layer.
6984820	6985820	Oh, yo.
6985820	6986820	Oh, hydrophobic.
6986820	6987820	Hydrophilic, hydrat.
6987820	6988820	Hydrophilic.
6988820	6990820	You know, by lipid, by layer.
6990820	6995620	You know what that means?
6995620	6996620	Melanin.
6996620	6997820	Melisitis making melanin.
6997820	6998820	Like arthritis.
6998820	6999820	Yo.
6999820	7000820	Generating your skin.
7000820	7002820	Oh, that's where racism begins.
7002820	7003820	Yo.
7003820	7004820	You see somebody.
7004820	7005820	You're like, oh, he's dark.
7005820	7006860	That's not a walk in the park.
7006860	7009260	You got to observe that there's just melanin.
7009260	7011280	And, oh my God.
