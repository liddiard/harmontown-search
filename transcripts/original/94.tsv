0	17340	freedom for the Leroy and the
17840	19920	live from Austin Texas and taught by Southwest festival my deep deep pleasure to announce that
20160	24080	June 6, 2009
24080	27340	Harman Town is now in session
28340	32340	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman
43340	45340	Thank you, thank you very much
46840	49340	Hello Austin, how many of you from Austin?
51060	56580	Okay, that's great. That's nice. That's a cool city, and they seem like good people. This is the best town
56580	61820	I love it. Yeah, I mean we would normally say that in any city, but we would be lying in most of them
62860	68580	Austin is definitely always enchanting. You know what they call it Jeff. They call it the San Francisco of Texas
69540	72900	Is that true? Yeah, I do I call it that
73540	76900	There's some facts about Austin the typewriter was invented here
78660	84540	It's in 1842 it went to war with Oklahoma correct and won
86660	91460	Because they wanted it to be shaped like Texas and Oklahoma wanted to kind of like
91740	95980	Change like the top square part of Texas and just be a box
97020	99020	but Oklahoma has to be shaped like a
99580	103980	Saucepan because Texas won the right to be shaped like Texas
104940	109620	Good job. What a great state what a big great state you can see it from outer space
110540	114020	It's it's the only state you can see from outer space. Yes
114380	118420	It's the only one that Google satellite maps can actually identify
119020	121580	It's three times bigger than the Great Wall of China
122940	124940	coiled up into a Texas shape
128020	131460	They just started allowing Asians in here as well. They just started
132020	136900	Which I think is very progressive of you guys to finally make that leap, Texas is one of the
137580	139580	pioneers of Asian
139660	142540	immigration that's the song yellow rose of Texas is actually
144460	151100	About a lady named Rose. It's it's it's code before like her agent me your give me your Asian weary your
151900	158540	Your Asian huddled masses yearning to breathe free in a big giant state. You can see from outer space like your stupid Great Wall. Okay
159580	162020	Anyways, but we don't want to localize the show
162020	167220	We want to give you a taste of harmontown as we do it in Los Angeles in the back of a quiet comic book store
168660	172820	We're we're we're gathered here and we're we're we're podcasting live
174180	176180	through YouTube who's
176620	179120	Hey bar people shut up. No, I mean
180140	182140	Too much. It doesn't matter
183380	185380	It kind of worked
187100	189100	We love you bar people
189300	190940	one of the perils of
190940	197100	Podcasting live I guess is that YouTube has like automated bots and drones that are detecting the music that we were
197900	202460	I was gonna play some kick-ass local country music, but we were afraid that it would shut down the podcast
202460	206740	Yeah, it's a text copyrighted music. So we were playing some of our friends bands
207540	214020	Dustin Marshall our producer has some friends with bands and you probably couldn't tell it from from real music
215100	219620	You probably thought it was real music. Where's the camera? Who's who's who's shooting this?
220260	223340	Right right there. Just some do with the head of the handheld thing
224060	231620	On a VHS from 1978. No, it's it Wow. I don't Jeff's confused that we're not podcasting it video live
231620	235620	Oh, I thought there was actually video for YouTube as well. No, no, you can do whatever you want physically
235620	237940	Whatever you wanted to do. So I should put my pants back on
238820	243100	Whatever you whatever you felt you weren't allowed to do. I don't know how technologies work
243820	247620	We're here at South by Southwest because we're premiering the Harman town documentary tonight
250820	252620	It's gonna be good
252620	258300	Spencer hasn't seen it. It's amazing that Spencer hasn't seen it because he's essentially the star of it. Yes, Spencer Spencer
258300	261500	I told him we had lunch today. We had Spencer and I had a nice little date this afternoon
261500	263500	We went to a photo booth. It was very romantic
264060	270580	A couple people walking down the road saw Spencer like Spencer Spencer like it's gonna fucking change everything for that guy
271020	278420	Yeah, Jesus. I I had lunch with the guys that literally started Kickstarter today
278420	284900	I have a wireless mic damn so keep go on. I'm gonna go retrieve my beer. Okay, I'm gonna test the limits of this microphone
285900	291740	This this is called crowd work Jeff. We're sending him out like a good to see good to see you. Pardon me
292700	296260	Get out of my way. Sorry. Sorry. There you are your little devil
297580	303540	Go on Dan. How far can you go? Huh? Find out how far you can go. Should we find out? Yeah, let's take it to the back
306140	308140	Sorry about that bar people
308340	311660	Check check. It's still working man. We can really get out. We can use this space
312620	318180	I'm playing I clicked a cue. How are you? Yeah, can I get you guys anything? You guys are good
319660	324460	Like the dessert cart. Yeah, we can hear you. I love it. Yeah
327780	333020	Say something I'm not I'm out of material. Look at you. Can you go outside of the street? See I'm gonna go outside
333540	336060	Can I go with my beer to leave my beer here?
336900	340280	All right, check. Is it clap if you can still hear me
342580	344580	Check one two one two
355460	357460	He can't hear us though
359500	361500	Let's all pretend like we fell asleep
363460	365460	It's very exciting
365820	372500	I told them I'll pretend like they fell asleep. All right, it was a dumb joke to engineer on the flag. Good job, Jeff
373260	375480	Say what? Oh my fucking beer. Thank you guys
376540	378540	God bless you, sir
381140	383140	Yeah
383140	388580	So it's been weird like I this this movie has been looming in my life
388900	394220	For a long time and I've well deserved it because I was the one who was narcissistic enough to say
394740	396820	Maybe we should make a movie about me
398460	402500	Being a narcissist and I hired this great guy. I didn't hire him
402500	408020	That's probably a misnomer kind of partnered with Neil Berkeley and had to agree with him
408020	411740	Like, you know, I can't tell you how to make your movie
412220	419740	So it's you know, it doesn't it doesn't show you what a genius. I am on the level that I think I am
420420	425580	Right. It shows you what a genius. I am probably kind of what's in reality
425740	430220	Like like it just kind of shows me as a just sort of a fat drunk asshole
431420	433420	Which is fine
433500	437620	Because I'd rather be a bad person than than make a bad documentary
437620	442720	And I think that one of the most important ingredients of a good documentary is a bad person
442720	449100	I think that's what you really like like you need so we put Spencer in there and he gets to be a good person
450740	456660	But there's a lot to talk about if we were doing a regular harmontown show I
457820	464820	Would I would do some corrections. I would do a correction segment right now. Okay. Can you play a sound cue for that?
468380	469620	Corrections
469620	471620	Yo, yo
471620	478900	Corrections sometimes I get things wrong people correct me all day long. They tell me you did it wrong
479140	482280	That's why I'm doing the correction song corrections
487820	495740	Austin loves yeah correction Austin Austin you're gonna get some entertainment tonight. This is this is no the show is no joke
495740	499240	Hey, you're leaving here entertained. Yeah, how many of you are going to the movie later?
502100	505100	Who among you wanted to go to the movie but can't
505260	508300	It's a weird reaction
511060	516500	How many of you can't because of scheduling conflicts, okay, so you really just can't
517660	520540	Does that mean they're turning people away? Is it sold out? Oh?
523220	528100	Badges only so you guys don't have badges stinking badges the lead is of what?
529900	532860	10 you can buy well if you buy a ticket do you still need a badge?
535100	538460	There's a guy yelling out
538460	540500	I wonder Dan if you and I will need our badges
540500	544660	We should just give someone that looks a little bit like us our badge you can certainly give two people bad
544660	549180	Because I took I don't know if you if you guys got those badges, but you have to take the face recognition photo
549460	554020	It wouldn't recognize my face. I I could be Nick Nolte. I could be anybody in that photo
554500	557700	But I think I have five tickets in my pocket will try to say
557700	560900	But I don't know if you don't need badges, but you do need a ticket
560900	565020	I will try to figure out a way to give them to the people that are most deserving. I say physical combat
566140	570620	I'm just gonna break a big Texas-sized pool cube and leave it on the floor
571860	573860	Gonna walk out of the room
574940	580900	All right, so I said that Stan Winston looked great on King of the Nerds on TVS
581460	583460	He's been dead since 2006
584620	586620	Corrections
587620	591260	Yeah, yeah, I said a corpse look great
591940	597140	He was a dead person. He's been dead for almost a decade, and I said he looked great
598100	600100	corrections
600740	603900	Someone someone tweeted me who worked with Stan Winston
603900	610060	I was like he's been dead since who doesn't say who are you confusing with a guy that works at Stan Winston studios?
610060	615500	Which you know made the poor choice to keep his name. I mean what what business president?
616620	618940	Is there there a Walt Disney, but?
619860	622580	And so I just assumed he was Stan Winston
622700	627620	I'm gonna I don't want to throw Aaron under the bus, but Aaron said I said is that Stan Winston and Aaron said yes
628700	634780	And she doesn't know who that is. She's 29. She thinks that the Challenger shuttle
635620	637860	Is the one we took from the hotel?
637860	639860	Oh
643700	645700	Make it fun of my young girlfriend
648420	650420	If being young is a crime
651660	653660	Why do I always brag about it?
654300	659420	All right, so speaking of being young it's a America's a young country Jeff and as you know
659580	662020	It was built on the black backs of
663060	665060	unpaid labor I
665540	671340	Just made a good Freudian slip appropriate it was built on the I
673180	676460	Once I once said in the podcast that
676900	682460	That America was the first country to make slavery illegal like I was like yeah, come on look at the bright side
682860	685780	Somebody tweeted me you're full of shit. Yes, like way the opposite
686700	688700	terrible terrible we
688860	693220	We were doing it until like yesterday, and we hung on to it as long as we could
693940	695940	Italy outlawed in a long time
696020	698020	Saying we were we were like it's fine
698500	700500	So sorry about that
701460	703220	everyone
703220	705220	What a bad thing to be wrong about
706740	709540	I think I already started I already corrected this one
709540	713900	But I once said that the TSA was a private company and not a government agency
714620	716820	Again, I don't want to throw it to the bus, but Aaron
717060	719060	I
719060	721820	Told me that and I just believed her
721820	727900	I don't Google anything Aaron says if I did my IQ would go up like a thousand points
727900	735300	I just believe everything she says because she's a woman and she's supposed to flick fill me with knowledge and life and she's my muse
735460	738260	So I'm like, oh really? Okay. I'll say that to everyone
739620	744380	It's not a private company. However, they can still go fuck themselves, right? I
745060	746380	Don't know
746380	749300	They keep the nice people safe when you're getting on the plane
749300	751380	No, but I'll take it in an airport by airport
752180	758100	Basis because some airports are cool and some airports are full of a-holes. I don't know why they don't smile a little bit
758100	763600	I think you guys flowing in or out of Philadelphia. Fuck those TSA people. They're the way fuck Philadelphia
764660	766660	Anybody in Philadelphia
766660	768660	Get out leave, sir
769180	774340	The city of brotherly hurry up and take your shoes off nobody's you're from Philly, sir
774620	779060	Is it is it just me or is that the angriest town on the world? People are pretty angry there
779700	781860	TSA. Yeah that Airport Wow
782540	783500	Not good
783500	788660	Is it me or was that thing that happened in LA where a guy like came into the airport and shot the whole thing up and shot
788660	794860	A TSA guy was like kind of that didn't really get publicized that much. Was that a little sort of a what airport was that?
795060	797460	There was LAX was our airport
798100	803860	It was a big deal for like a day and a half kind of just some people and then it just went away
803860	805860	Did Aaron tell you that?
806260	811420	Maybe I don't know. I should Google it. Yeah. All right. That's the end of the correction segment
811700	817340	Yeah, yeah now everything's gonna be right. Everything I say is gonna be day or night
817740	824260	There's nothing more right than that. I fucked your mama cuz she's not fat. But if she was I'm still fucker
828380	830380	You're a gentleman, yes
830900	832900	Because I don't believe in
833700	838340	Socializing women to be ashamed of their bodies. I would fuck your mama no matter what I
841100	845340	Think it's shitty the way we treat our women and I will always be there for your mama
845340	849180	I like there's people there's people eating over there that have nothing to do with the show
849180	851740	They're having chicken wings and you're talking about no
851740	851940	Yeah
851940	856980	They're just hanging out like Seth Rogen made a comic book or something and they're like in the back waiting for it to be
856980	859340	Unveiled I got off the plane here at Austin
860180	862580	International Airport, whatever you call it and there's you know
862580	867900	The people are there waiting there with placards for people that have like a car service and they'll say like s you know
867900	869900	Thompson or Jay Anderson
869980	871980	There was a woman a young gal
872700	876500	holding a sign the size of like a movie poster and
877020	881340	In a font that was bigger than the font they used to announce the end of World War two
882340	884340	Seth Rogen
884700	888380	Like everyone else had a regular-sized thing. It's like give the guy a break
889100	891860	Also, I found out today. He flew in today. That was yesterday
892820	897380	Somebody was fucking around. Yeah, somebody was hoping Seth Rogen would just wander into their car
898020	903540	It was like Sandra Bernhardt and king of comedy like she was just waiting Seth Rogen, maybe
904460	906820	She probably had a couple behind that they were like
907860	909860	Barack Obama
910060	912060	I'll take what I can get
913060	919780	All right, let's let's do a new segment Jeff you want the same musical cue or let's do a different one, okay
920460	922460	this segments called
926180	929960	Forest controversy forest controversy. Let's do
933980	940660	Forest controversy and we're gonna argue about something that I decided to argue about that's not really an issue
940660	943180	But I'm deciding to make it an issue
944780	946780	Forest controversy
946780	948780	All right
949300	953700	The show has it all you guys the show we're singing we're dancing I went outside
958220	960700	That's groundbreaking entertainment petty cabs
961260	965740	Petty cabs petty cabs the little bicycle rickshaw things that you have here in this town
965820	968220	They have them in San Francisco during comic-con
968220	973820	It's like guys you get into a backseat of a big tricycle and and a guy drives you around or a girl
973820	979380	I don't I don't they make me very uncomfortable. I don't I don't like to use them. Why?
980140	984220	It feels it's too. I'm too close to the actual
985660	989340	Capitalism it's just like like you you're also right up somebody's ass
989340	995180	You have a you have a button right in your face the entire ride if you're it's too weird to be close enough to a place
995300	997420	That someone can bike you
998300	1003420	But you choose not to walk so they have to bike extra people
1003940	1010060	That's weird. I took one yesterday from like the was at the east side over there or kind of from that little
1010900	1017620	What's it called yellow jacket social club that place rules and I took a you couldn't get a cab because like we were promised
1017620	1024060	When we came here that there's a company called uber that that is like a private cab company. Yeah, fuck uber
1024900	1027740	They're a sponsor and fuck you. Fuck you. I
1028740	1033660	If you don't know who uber is I'm here to tell you that they're a bad company and they should be ashamed of themselves
1033660	1035900	All right, I'll foot that 15 grand
1041580	1043260	Songs in community
1043260	1045260	I'll just write that check. Okay good
1045660	1047420	But I took I took a little cabinet
1047420	1051980	This gal was half my height a little tiny petite little thing named Stephanie and she drove me
1051980	1054940	She was very cool and I wanted to go somewhere that was pretty far
1054940	1057340	But you could not you cannot get a taxi in this town right now
1057500	1061220	You cannot get into a vehicle and even if you do you can't make it anywhere
1061220	1063220	So the petty cab is kind of convenient
1063460	1068660	Let's convenient and it's probably that's why I said artificial controversy because I don't I don't really I'm sure it's a good thing
1068660	1077580	It's just I feel weird as a 41 year old man like climbing my fat ass onto a bike and going like you you walk
1078980	1080980	You walk for me
1081340	1085140	Make your feet do more for my feet
1085140	1086100	I
1086100	1088380	Came from the east side came to the convention center
1088380	1092620	Which I think is right across the street to get my badge and I ran a dispenser and so Spencer never right in the same
1092620	1095820	Line together. I go. Hey, I'm gonna go to this other bar and like farther west side of town
1095820	1098620	And I got this gal waiting outside in this petty cab
1099060	1105680	So we get in it and about two blocks later a guy pulls up alongside her in another petty cab and she goes like hey
1105680	1107680	Eric you want to do switches?
1108020	1109260	like
1109260	1114180	We just got into his that he took over especially like yeah, I'm pretty uncomfortable about that
1114180	1116660	He's like I did we did double the weight
1117060	1119760	Yeah, you know like it's not good. That was kind of man
1120020	1120520	Yeah
1120520	1123060	and I was that well someone else like like like we
1123220	1126460	Erin and I walked past a group of people that were coming out of a
1126820	1133460	Restaurant and like this this young lady who had had a few margaritas with lunch was like she just came out was like
1133460	1134820	petty cab
1134820	1136580	petty cab
1136580	1139260	Like she was just yelling it out that a guy came over
1142340	1148020	She just yelled it out like and then she started talking to him about his rates before she was just like is it still five
1148020	1150940	Dollars and he was like, well, it's five dollars of you a blah blah blah
1150940	1155360	She's like, okay and got out and I was like, I that's that's I don't want to be that
1155360	1161980	That was like the bellock to my Indiana. Like I didn't want I felt like I needed to confront that that's what character
1161980	1165700	That's why they call it a petty cab. I know that's the thing. It's also the word petty
1165700	1173500	It's like it really the Emperor's clothes are just down the toilet. I just want to see something cuz from up here
1174220	1178580	And I'm fine with this because I've been through worse up here
1178580	1183660	It sounds like absolutely no one in this room to hear us at all and no one's listening
1183660	1185660	Can you guys hear everyone's just talking?
1185660	1190300	Okay, so you can hear me fine. You're gonna be fine

1199820	1204740	Dennis now I know what it's like to be at this show wandering amongst you like a lowland gorilla to me
1204740	1206740	It seems like it's like being at LAX
1207020	1211940	Okay, these guys are just hanging out talking. Yeah, just talking this guy's pointing at his phone
1211940	1213940	He's telling these guys you should look at my phone
1214540	1216540	You were drinking with me I
1216780	1218780	Was blacked out
1218900	1222100	No, you're trying to take advantage of my alcohol is over like you could just tell me that
1223020	1226780	What are you guys doing at South by Southwest? Are you premiering a film?
1227500	1229060	Yes, yes
1229060	1230980	Will you tell the people?
1230980	1232980	Have you all ever heard of Bitcoin?
1233500	1235500	Bitcoin y'all heard of Bitcoin
1236060	1241460	If you heard of Bitcoin, you know you right now you can't get an iOS wallet in the Bitcoin store
1241460	1243460	I mean in the iOS store, right?
1244260	1249940	Come talk to me. All right, and I can get you a Bitcoin wallet. What's right now?
1251620	1254040	What sort of weird hustle is going on over there? Hey
1255460	1260700	Hijack our show. Oh, oh shit. He's standing at all. I damn it. I don't know damn it
1260700	1264340	Let me if you want me come on stay get up here. Get up here most day. All right
1264700	1266700	I
1271940	1273940	Check this out. Okay
1273980	1277700	So it's nothing illegitimate. Okay, somebody call the police
1278460	1280460	Call the police
1280660	1284540	All right, I just smell great. I know it's not really good
1284540	1287660	I got a smell great when you when you go back to the crowd eventually
1287660	1290340	I want everyone to take a little whiff of this guy everybody smell me
1290340	1297020	You smell like a like a fucking pine tree. Smell me. Okay, I'm gonna do it really quick. Okay fucking break it now illegitimate
1297020	1303980	Okay, we're within the Apple and Enterprise Developer Solution cuz when you join and when you get our application
1304300	1309460	You become a member of our cooperative. Okay of our prerogative
1310100	1314980	Cooperate. Oh god, Jim and I thought cooperatives. Okay now check this out. You can sue who you want to sue
1315940	1317380	Listen
1317380	1320860	Cooperatives were like a big thing a while ago because people work together
1321060	1327820	So we built a cooperative to allow all of us to work together with Bitcoin for the people who have our wallet to get paid
1328060	1329380	You understand what I'm saying?
1329380	1335860	So it's like distribution of wealth without distribution of wealth because the reason why we did it. Can I do it real quick?
1336500	1339580	In this country the stages are all yours, right?
1340380	1342380	That's what's up, all right
1342380	1348980	So in this country we feel like that it was an injustice. Okay, it's an injustice that the country
1349620	1356020	Advertises a lottery to the poorest people. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's in just why you got me on board now. That's in just
1356660	1358460	So check this out
1358460	1364340	But those same poor people can't invest in early a early stage startups. That's stupid
1364500	1367700	So you tell poor people here go invest in this lottery
1367860	1373140	Somebody got a win it might as well be you but you can't take that same money and invest it in people
1373420	1375420	Right that are right in your neighborhood
1378500	1383260	There you go, so what we figured out is what we did was we said, okay
1383260	1388340	If you if you have this situation where you have a cooperative that owns a piece of a company
1388340	1393180	Now the cooperative can get paid from the company and the people who own the part of the cooperative
1393260	1397260	Get the same benefits as early-stage investors and it's all legal
1398500	1404260	It's all legal. So so that's our spiel if you want to get up in the cooperative
1404260	1409980	It's a free trial for South by Southwest. I'm down here in Harman town chillin and guess what?
1409980	1414780	I'm gonna let y'all know something. What's the major street name in uh, and in Austin?
1415700	1418540	No trinity starts with an L course
1419780	1421780	That's my name
1422420	1430300	Guess what my middle name is. Wait, what's your name? My first name is Lamar my middle name is what's the what's the city?
1431300	1433300	This is my town
1435100	1437100	My name is
1442820	1449300	Thank you, thank you very much for coming no problem everybody Lamar Austin Wilson
1451780	1457340	Smell that guy. It's a cooperate smell him. Everybody smell him. He smells like a delicious forest a
1458980	1460980	Delicious forest. Yeah, I
1461380	1467900	Wanted nestled near him and Lamar Austin Houston Wilson Wilson. That was the best
1468620	1474940	Again, I only have one question. Well, all of that stuff was great. It's a cooperative Bitcoin like get in on the ground floor
1474940	1479900	Right, let's gather people's money. If bitcoins a real thing then if there's a real currency
1479900	1485660	Let's let's get let's let people get involved in it from the ground floor that aren't speculators and carpetbaggers
1485700	1490040	My only question is why is he having a meeting about it in the back of my fucking show?
1491300	1493300	It turned out fine
1493500	1500340	Maybe he's the shrewdest businessman of all time and he knew there'd be a platform and what if this was the cure for cancer podcast
1500540	1505700	What if what if I was trying to cure cancer and he's talking about fucking Bitcoin in the back?
1506140	1509820	That would be that would be a crime. He's lucky. I have nothing to do tonight
1511100	1517140	You have no agenda except watch a movie about you. Yeah, I got I'm open. I'm funny
1518620	1521460	Everyone here is a higher moral high ground than that you
1522180	1527540	That's true. Every documentary is about like probably saving the world. It's a documentary about abortion
1527540	1531100	It's a documentary about well, I don't know. I can't rattle them off because I don't care
1531140	1535860	Our documentary is largely a documentary about us singing songs about dicks and balls for a month
1537900	1545780	Yeah, yeah, that was one of the big things that Neil the director regretted cutting out was the Pringles dick song and the chicken noodle
1547580	1553580	Special features special features. I said it's it's like it's a it's a it's a little over 90 minutes the documentary
1554420	1556860	I mean believe me the guys he claims
1556980	1561740	I mean he's got a four-hour version of the documentary that I'm sure we'll all get to see one day
1561740	1565940	Yeah, he's got he's also got 650 hours of everything
1567020	1571880	We were talking Neil and I and he was saying that like he could put out the entire long version because in some of the fans
1572220	1576740	They'll probably cut together a better movie than I made because that's how that's how our fans are. Yeah
1576740	1581700	Yeah, we should just dump the entire all 500 700 hours of all the footage
1581780	1587420	Why don't we then let one one of you weirdos just get in it and then and make like the perfect kind of it
1587420	1589420	Should we bring Neil up here?
1597980	1599780	Looking good, baby
1599780	1601260	You know correctly
1601260	1606060	Lady ladies feast your eyes. Oh, wow. Okay, you said at the hotel
1606060	1610520	You're like we can't share an uber because you got a change and we made fun of you. But holy cow
1610520	1613940	Yeah changed. Thanks for bringing me up after Lamar. Yeah
1614880	1619240	We can't to follow but but I'm not quite so the way it works is
1621400	1625680	For those of you who are just listening there's no way to express how dynamic that guy was on stage
1627360	1633160	Whatever you're doing Lamar I'm in I'm in he took over the room and then after he left everything got quieter
1633160	1636920	I don't I mean, I don't think that's because he was making the noise
1636920	1639640	I think it's cuz everyone was like I'm into it. I'm into Bitcoin
1639640	1643720	I think they're like I think they're online trying to like find out more about Bitcoin
1643720	1648600	He made a good case, but this is Neil Berkeley who threw out the the movie is largely a ghost because he's a good
1652040	1656960	As much as we were all stuck together on a bus and we want to incorporate the crew and
1657200	1660760	The director and everybody because we're all trapped in one vehicle for a month
1661960	1667560	He kind of insisted on being this ghostly figure. I I was talking to the producer earlier and I said, I'm very nervous
1667560	1672720	I hope people like this movie and he goes. Do you know where you're showing it? It's like asking kindergartens if they like these cupcakes
1674120	1676840	All right, I mean not that you guys are easy or anything
1677680	1680560	It's just that you you're driven mainly by naps and sugar
1682440	1688240	But yeah, I hope I didn't I can't I've been I mean like for the last over a year
1688240	1691440	We've been living in a world where this movie hasn't come out yet
1691440	1694920	And now we I just I don't care if they hate it or love it
1694920	1699600	But I can't wait to move across a threshold into a world where other people have seen this thing
1699960	1701520	Because I don't have no idea
1701520	1708400	I'm usually in total control over how people see me whether it seems from a distance like I'm making an ass of myself
1708400	1710400	I'm crucifying myself. I'm
1710760	1715440	Attacking others. I'm attacking myself. I'm all it's all my big control freak game
1715440	1719280	Like I'm always just going I control what happens if you come to shoot me
1719280	1723520	Your bullets gonna go through a bigger hole that I blew moments before you came in the door
1723680	1728520	And that's how I like it, but this movie is like I've I fucked up
1728520	1735480	I hired a great filmmaker. I I had to make a deal with him that I got no control over this thing. I have no idea
1736080	1740400	Whether it's good or bad because I watch it and I'm in it, and I'm a narcissist
1740400	1743600	So I love it, but at the same time I hate myself
1743600	1746700	So I'm like this must be stupid because I'm in it all the time
1747240	1752800	What I might my line when I said what I tell people is why I think it's interesting and why I made it was
1753160	1756920	It's not to decide whether you love or hate Dan. It's not about that
1756920	1761840	It's about understanding why there's a room full of people watching him or in listening to him talk
1761920	1769520	Yes, you are all here because he speaks to you. He does something that you all are reacting to it's explaining that so yeah
1769520	1771960	It has something it's your fault. It's all of your fault. Yes
1772640	1777320	For me that the movie really is not not about Dan not about our show that it's about Bitcoin
1777320	1779320	I
1781640	1785680	The show is never going to really recover from it from him leaving the stage is it well
1785680	1787360	I mean that's like saying we're
1787360	1794440	Recover this islands never going to recover from this papaya. I mean yeah, that's right. We should base this fucking industry on it
1795520	1801920	I was gonna say like the movie is about the fans of the show because there's a group of people that showed up
1801920	1803920	I just put your name right there with the beard and the glasses
1804680	1807760	Andy you're gonna come up for a second. Oh Andy young. Yeah, yeah
1812800	1818340	I want to apologize to Andy. He shot some footage. We didn't get to use any of it the movie
1818440	1823560	That's not one. I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry about that. That's not one does one of the dudes told me they're gonna go
1823560	1825560	Wait, he's in it though, isn't he?
1826560	1830400	And he's in the movie and he came to the show that we did in Austin during the tour in the movie
1830640	1833680	He came back and your girlfriend or just female friend
1833680	1836680	No, just from the is a shooter for me to kneel to kneel
1836680	1839180	Right and they came back and I did this really beautiful interview
1839180	1843920	And it was like that was pretty early on in our tour and you came back with this giant smile on your face
1843920	1846120	And she had this great smile on her face
1846120	1852360	And there's a really cool shot in the documentary when you guys leave the darn our green room. They walk out and
1853120	1856040	You I think she's shooting you right right? Yeah. Yes
1856760	1858760	Is that the film
1858760	1864400	He gives us look like he just met the Rolling Stones and it was like and it's just like we didn't do anything except to
1864400	1867440	Do our little show but there's this weird sort of awesome. Love
1868120	1873800	There's these little bits of the film where there's straight-to-camera interviews with with our harmonians and that's tonight
1873800	1875440	I really I mean, I'm a crier
1875440	1881840	I get really emotional and I watch that stuff everybody that season always talks about like being brought to tears in those moments
1881840	1887840	It's just there's something strange about that because there's it's not like there's anybody on camera saying I lost my baby
1887840	1893600	And I I use harm in town to yeah, it's there's that it's just humanity
1893600	1897520	it's just it's just people's faces and they're just saying I I
1898920	1902240	Feel like I'm allowed to be me because this guy's such an asshole
1903480	1907300	So I said to tweet out to all the fans saying if you want to be in harm in town
1907540	1914060	Shoot your experience of going to the to the show like shoot what you do that day going to harm in town and and he's the
1914060	1919340	Only person that did it and he's in the movie. So you all could have been in harm in town. I haven't seen
1920140	1921380	I
1921380	1924180	Haven't seen it. It sounds like I cry in the movie. I hope I don't cry
1925740	1928980	You Ella super cool look out and smile right now
1931060	1932940	He's fucking adorable, right
1932980	1938460	So like with that that happens a lot throughout the movie where we meet people and there's just this
1938660	1940740	Something that I don't even know they know the cameras rolling
1940740	1944900	They're just kind of staring kind of absolutely into the lens. Well Andy now make a face like
1945540	1953980	you just found out that you you're totally hungry and you're totally high and you just found out that you forgot that you put
1954100	1957780	Two Reese's peanut butter cups in the freezer and you just found it
1957780	1961300	So open the freezer jar and make that face at that moment of discovery
1962140	1967980	That's the face that he makes that's the face after he interviews me. That's pretty much how I felt
1967980	1970980	Yeah, which makes me feel like a bad person cuz I'm not worth that
1970980	1973020	I'm not a Reese's peanut butter cup in a freezer
1973020	1973540	No
1973540	1976860	I think you are absolutely worth that like I think Neil made a great point of like why
1977100	1980900	People are in this room because you make people want to get out of their chairs and make something
1980900	1987580	Yeah, and that's like why I was so interested in like seeing the show, right? Like how playing great into having back on community
1987980	1989980	This town is full of awesome people
1989980	1996420	Yeah, and in the movie in the movie all the interviews are they're looking right in the camera very Errol Morris
1996420	2000980	I ripped that guy off because any whatever but there's no lower thirds
2000980	2006860	Like the fans that are right next to Ben Stiller that you he is not more important than anyone else in the movie
2006940	2013300	Jack Black Sarah Silverman is right next to stop Andy and some fan with there. No one's name is down the corner
2013300	2015300	They're all just people talking to the camera
2015580	2018740	Andy are you going to the movie? Oh fuck? Yeah, I'll be there for sure. Yeah
2018820	2023980	Do you do you have a friend here? That's not able to go to the movie because they don't have a ticket. Um
2024940	2029700	Yeah, those dudes I guess yes. Oh, of course Dan. Well, yeah, it's two people. Yeah
2031940	2037660	Yeah, they're here somewhere guys you have to make the face when you when he gives up so you have to make everyone's Andy's
2037660	2041980	Friend right now. They're yeah me. I love a handy. Oh that guy. Yeah, of course
2041980	2044500	All right, cuz I only have five of these but so all right
2044500	2048540	I'm giving you two to Andy young cuz he went to University of Texas and yeah
2048540	2053540	I'm so sorry about whoever tries to mom me after this. You put you bring me a really weird position
2053540	2056500	I'll get ya. How do these work? These are just like weird
2057660	2063380	Rip department. I got this. Where does the ticket head part about this is that when Andy gets murdered in an alley later on?
2064740	2066740	He never got to see the movie. Yeah
2066900	2068900	That's a double whammy. Yeah, exactly
2068900	2071700	They didn't pan out. Yeah, cool. Thank you guys. Really appreciate it
2074100	2077300	Star of Harman town Amy young Bitcoin
2084140	2085900	I swear to god though. He's got a fucking point
2085900	2090700	That's a minute. I mean, I mean, I'm not like that should be surprising but I like I I think I get it
2090700	2095700	I'm not into economics, but I understand like we keep arguing about Bitcoin in the writers room at Rick and Morty
2095820	2099140	But it's like like if this is an emergent currency
2099540	2101540	Why are there people who?
2102220	2108420	Barely have the internet who are being locked out of it before it even fucking starts isn't that what his point is like?
2108420	2113940	Let's start like a credit union where people can like like like get in on this shit
2113940	2120540	So that if Bitcoin didn't turn into a thing that there would be people who were poor before it became a thing that as a result
2120540	2123340	Are now not poor. Let's make a new batch of
2126300	2129780	I think that's what he meant. It's it's it's okay
2130260	2135740	If I got that wrong to be honest, I consider myself a good listener. I was so dazzled by his scent
2136620	2137980	I
2137980	2139980	Gotta find out what deodorant or cologne
2140380	2145820	Goddamn it was what you kind of want to just never found out that wasn't cologne. What that's what if that's what came out
2145820	2150340	I think when he sweats what I was amazing his own sense of self-worth
2150860	2152180	Yeah
2152180	2158900	Or then he's in the wrong business. Like he should be bottling like like like the smell of Lamar Austin Wilson
2160140	2165060	Instead he's hooked into this Bitcoin thing, but he's cursed with this beautiful smell
2166780	2172620	All right, so what else is on the docket let me take a look at my Neil what do you what's your problem?
2172620	2175060	What do you what do you want to talk about? Did you know Stan Winston was dead?
2175700	2177900	No, okay. Do you like the TSA?
2178540	2180540	No, okay
2180540	2185260	Okay. All right. Here we go. I'm getting married to my fiance Erin McGathey
2189060	2191460	I'm gonna marry the fuck out of this woman
2192340	2197660	And part of marrying the fuck out of somebody in usually traditionally is
2198180	2200180	Like you absorbed them
2201020	2205140	Into your last name the woman takes the last name of the man
2205380	2211860	But then in LA especially among creatives actors and that's gonna think they hyphenate. Oh, I'm
2214140	2216220	Catherine Zeta, I'm gonna marry
2217140	2219140	Tom Oliver Jones
2219180	2225460	I'm gonna become Catherine Zeta Jones. I'm not giving up the Zeta. That's probably not what happened with her
2226220	2230820	But but like I need people to help me. We don't know what to do
2230820	2235740	I honestly don't want it. I don't want to force my last name on Aaron Aaron Harmon is a shitty name
2236940	2243080	But how about I don't how about Dan and Aaron Lamar Austin Wilson
2244860	2249420	What about Dan McGathey well, I mean there's that but I
2250100	2255540	Like I like Dan Harmon. I don't want to make her be Aaron Harmon. I don't want to be Dan
2256420	2259300	Keep your own names and not do because what about the children?
2259820	2261820	Huh? What are the children?
2262540	2268800	Make up an awesome way. Then the middle name becomes McGathey or whatever. But then what about their children? What are we Spanish?
2270820	2274220	Think about five generations from now. They're gonna be like my name is Ramon
2276300	2280000	That guy's in the movie what's up that guy's in the movie
2280840	2282840	Yeah
2287200	2291600	That's Mars, he's part of our no Mars is in the movie. Yeah, congratulations you
2293000	2296100	Stand up if you would like to stand up
2303040	2305040	I like the idea of
2305120	2310320	Professional keep your name personal take Harmon and the kids get that. Oh
2310960	2312960	So, okay
2313440	2319640	Yeah, all right. I think that makes sense. Sorry. I missed that. What was the pitch saying professional you can somehow
2320440	2325280	Compartmentalize your professional name from your personal name and that the kids will just become Harmon's
2327320	2329320	The kids get our name
2329600	2331600	All right. Let's bring Aaron up here
2335840	2337840	Yo gonna marry this girl
2338240	2344960	Gonna take her last name for a world. She's throwing t-shirts to the crowd. Aaron McGathey saying it loud
2345320	2352320	She's gonna marry Dan Harmon soon. She's gonna have a baby in her womb gonna. What are we gonna call that baby?
2352320	2354720	I don't know. McGathey, maybe
2357240	2358320	I
2358320	2360320	Just decided. Okay. I
2360960	2362960	think that I'm going to
2363600	2366720	I'm going to keep McGathey as my middle name
2367680	2375400	I'm gonna make Harmon my last name and when we have children, I'm gonna make a secret map and passageway
2376920	2382200	That'll be like in their nursery and they'll always see it there and it'll say McGathey tunnel
2382200	2385120	We won't tell them that my right maiden name is McGathey
2385640	2390640	But then one day we'll hire someone to come in as like a sprite and say like hey
2391600	2398000	And he'll have eyeballs painted on his hands saffron saffron over here saffron saffron
2398840	2400840	We could talk about it later
2401400	2404100	saffron and cinnamon cinnamon boy and girl
2405680	2407680	Tuberic are you having strippers?
2408760	2412680	Snickers Tuberic Harmon McGathey you get in here right now
2413840	2415280	Apple
2415280	2418140	Saffron you are due on the main stage right now
2419140	2423380	And the hired actor will say hey
2423780	2428460	Do you know you're special and saffron and cinnamon will be like yes. Yes, we know we're special
2428460	2430900	We know our father is like the most smart man in the world
2430900	2437840	He's told us a million times over in that nursery book that he wrote especially for us and we know that mom loves yarn
2440660	2441580	And
2441580	2442700	He'll be like hey
2442700	2443180	No
2443180	2447180	Here's a key and they'll be a key to the passageway and they'll go down the passageway
2447340	2454300	And there'll be a room that will be illuminated by torches with like a giant banner that says you are in the gathy
2455580	2460020	And they'll be they'll be like ashes for them to make ends on their forehead
2460020	2464380	And it will be like a secret club, and then they'll find me sleeping
2465420	2467420	in a in my
2468700	2470860	You saving us for all the therapy time right now
2471820	2473820	It's not fucking horrifying
2474580	2476580	Kids walk on a torch lit
2477220	2480220	They'll find you sleeping in this tunnel in there
2480700	2486820	I'll be I'll be in our room, but I'll be I'll be wearing like one of those really beautiful Nicole Kidman
2487220	2493260	Dressing gowns, but I imagine she wears from like eyes wide shut no from her life. I just imagine she wears nice nightgowns
2493980	2499620	And they'll they'll round me and I'll say yes, you are you're a you're a McGathey
2500620	2507100	And so it'll be special it'll be like the lady from the lake you know I can make this a lot simpler
2507180	2509180	Don't have kids
2510220	2515580	Saves a lot about our you said that about a dog, and you love our dog. Yeah, your dog's a weirdo, but I like
2520820	2526340	Yeah, what Neil's asking if we can tell a story about something the answer is yes automatically. What is it what?
2527340	2533500	The pickup shot, but the when I do wear the same shirt from a year ago. Oh Jesus Christ Neil, okay?
2534140	2536140	I'm sorry. I'm sorry
2536180	2539780	Yeah, okay. Here's a dirty little secret about documentaries
2540860	2548420	As you shoot 650 hours you edit it into 90 minutes and then depending on the structure of the 90 minutes you you may decide you
2548420	2552780	Need like maybe a shot for instance of Dan Harmon leaving his house in the morning
2553220	2557900	And that may be shot a year later in which case you try to match the shirt
2557900	2561680	And if Dan Harmon has games, let's say 30 pounds
2563380	2565380	That's how he'll find out
2566420	2574460	Is me walking down the sidewalk with buttons flying off of my stomach as I move this way
2574460	2578900	That way like is it fine. I was I was too fat to play the role of myself
2579380	2582380	To be cast as myself
2584420	2591880	He said I'd like to think the cotton shrinks, but I think it's something else and then and then you sort of slowly squat down
2593420	2595420	Until the shirt
2597660	2603500	Like a treasure box you bet down fast enough on a shirt just completely atomized
2604460	2607300	To have missed I can just turn
2608100	2609900	speaking of shirts and
2609900	2613920	Corrections we have some shirts that are throughout some shirts nice segway
2615940	2618460	And I I guess I've given Dan some
2619060	2625780	Wrong information before we went on tour. I suggested to Dan. You know, we really should have merch on the tour
2626180	2630220	And Dan said no. No, I don't want those people have anything of me
2631020	2633740	And I said no, I think they like you big back and forth
2633740	2640980	But anyway, I I did all the I I designed all the t-shirts with Jenny fine artists and all the poster
2640980	2647020	She did the art I took the picture. Oh, but I was also put in charge of ordering all the shirts and I
2647540	2652740	Don't know how to order things and was given a lot of advice and I ordered a certain number of t-shirts and there's a shot
2652740	2656380	In the documentary you'll see there's a shot with a ton of trash bags
2657020	2658340	outside of the
2658860	2660860	More t-shirts than could fit on a bus
2662260	2665500	Look no one event. Hey Lynn doesn't have this many t-shirts
2666500	2671740	No, no, you don't understand and I was really stubborn and it was yelling at this bus driver
2671740	2677820	Who's been on a thousand tours telling him that I knew everything about t-shirts. Yeah, we sold a fifth of them
2678820	2683140	But there are tons and tons of t-shirts because we didn't take Bitcoin
2683140	2689020	Is the point of your story that we have a lot of t-shirts to give away
2689020	2693060	The point of my story is that sometimes I'm really sure about things that are incorrect, but also
2693660	2695820	Harman town calm. We have a few left
2696940	2702740	We have a few thousand sure you already give away all the ones for tonight. There are a few more Casey
2702740	2704740	You Casey's gonna toss out
2708140	2711540	T-shirt tossing wrap give that guy in the backpack one there you are
2713140	2717060	Is there anybody here who feels they're more more deserving of a t-shirt than anybody else?
2717860	2722180	All right, you miss come up on stage make your case. Is there hold on to that Casey?
2723100	2727580	Miss what? Why do you feel that you deserve one of these more than the other people that want a t-shirt? I?
2728260	2730700	Don't know who Dan Harmon is. I never heard of him
2732140	2734140	I've never watched community
2735140	2739060	Boyfriend who loves Dan Harmon and we walked with 15 blocks in the rain. I
2740060	2742060	Didn't hear the last part, but I
2745180	2747500	Feel like she you did you did well
2747500	2753420	I feel that that you a lot of people might have said as much or more I feel that maybe you should wrap your case
2769060	2771060	That is not waterproof
2771260	2775380	Yeah, all right. That was the ask of a child. This would be adorable

2814620	2818300	But who's the gal on the way in the back you know the next hell you're a tiny little whisper of a thing
2819020	2821020	Yeah, you you're not an XL. Oh

2859820	2864060	Like I should have held up the extra large and go and he goes that's not a shirt
2864060	2866080	And then you hold up the triple X now. That's a shirt
2866780	2871700	All right. Well, let's let's do the same similar process with these tickets to the movie
2871700	2878220	They got three left. I want to me. I want to feel satisfied that do more rapping for somebody that what that

2887380	2892740	I'm afraid to look at them. I'm afraid to look at them. I don't know how to do this. I just want to try to
2895900	2900740	Well, don't go out and I want to hear people's stories, you know, I like the guy but
2901220	2903940	He's already coming up. I wasn't gonna say somebody else
2906020	2908020	He already got a shirt
2911940	2917780	I really love community and Rick and Morty. I think they're fucking hilarious. I told him like five times. So
2919780	2921780	Do you hate harm in town
2926060	2931220	All right, come on I'm going I'm going out Dan I have the guy I'm almost certain I have the one
2931580	2937620	What you do. I think I do. Okay. All right, what's your name? Other way? Nick Nick park it
2938540	2939980	I
2939980	2944700	Think Nick got like three photos with me and he had to keep adjusting the lighting and stuff
2944700	2949580	Yeah, I didn't there's a guy that looks enough like George Lucas to be notable
2950140	2952340	Who's who's who's not raising his hand?
2952340	2955080	He's pouting and the people his friends are pointing
2955080	2960220	I'm nominating him and he's and he's being a good person about it saying I don't I don't feel like I deserve
2960220	2962660	I will you come will you are you willing to come up here, sir?
2963260	2965260	Okay, come on up stage
2968460	2970460	Oh, yeah, sure
2972420	2978380	Your friends think that you hello everybody deserve this. Do you know why they would think that what's your name first off?
2979260	2985380	Brendan Brendan Brendan everybody. Oh, do I deserve it? I mean does anybody deserve anything right now, of course not
2986140	2989180	But why do your friends think you deserve? No, I don't have a ticket to the movie
2989180	2994820	I recently lost my job and I think that's a good reason. That's a great reason. Yeah, it's hard to find work
2995820	2997300	And I'm looking
2997300	3002580	But I think seeing the documentary will inspire me to become who I am. Are your friends
3002580	3009180	Are your friends going to the movie? Do they have tickets? No, no, but they want you to go because they they love me
3009380	3014940	They're they're rallying around you. They want you to go. What's what I'm gonna cry. What job did you lose?
3014940	3020500	Do you mind saying I was tech support. It wasn't like my career goal kind of thing
3020500	3022620	What would your dream gig be like pie in the sky?
3022780	3028460	Like if you could do anything and get paid to do the dream gig and be embarrassing about it
3028460	3031660	What would be the best way to make a living actually voiceover for cartoon?
3035660	3037660	All right, okay
3037660	3044300	Well, make sure you give your name to somebody over there in the VIP section that says they work for Starburns Industries
3044300	3050020	There's Casey rub if you're if we could get you out to LA to do a voice for Rick and Morty and here
3050500	3052500	I
3054820	3059140	Because I can do that now and here's your ticket to the harm in town from there
3066300	3071500	Brendan when you come to LA make sure that you come and join us on stage at meltdown for harm in town, man
3072140	3074880	That's looking great. Also if we could have him come up and maybe do a
3075680	3079760	If you got if you got the wherewithal Brendan to come to LA maybe we can have him sit in on a D&D
3079760	3081760	like a little trial voiceover thing like
3081840	3086720	One of these two remaining tickets doesn't have the barcode like stub on it. It got torn off
3086960	3090080	But because there's two remaining tickets, I want to try something special
3091040	3097560	Because my relationship with Aaron is not exactly portrayed in a light that makes everyone want to run out and fall in love
3100200	3104240	And yet I'm getting married to her because I do love her and I think that
3104880	3110240	I I wonder if there's a couple here tonight that that came to South by Southwest
3111080	3117760	All right. We got this is extra progressive. This is a female female couple to go. Yeah, you do. All right, sweet
3117760	3121560	I love it. That's just gonna make me feel better about myself all week
3127360	3129360	There are also stairs over here
3130200	3132200	So
3133880	3136200	You guys are you guys are a couple and
3137640	3141860	What are your name? I'm KD Bethany. All right
3142920	3147740	I'm not allowed to say that's hot because that's that's that's a bygone era
3152000	3155680	Okay, well what but do you guys bicker ever do you fight
3156560	3160680	But it's usually about like how we feel about things and we kind of get
3162760	3170200	Is one is one of you to the the robot and the other one the the plant goddess
3175720	3178280	Are you punished for explaining your feelings
3178280	3187440	We kind of we try not to punish each other for explaining our feelings because I think it makes everything worse but
3188480	3194360	There's you know, there's a lot of time. So there's a balance. What was your what was your last big fight?
3194360	3201080	And it really yelled these microphones because we have to get but it's kind of loud. I mean, it's gonna have to get like pretty deep
3201080	3203080	Do you want me to?
3203760	3205760	If it's okay with you guys
3206080	3208080	Yeah, yeah, I'm a
3209120	3213760	Sophomore in college right now and I was living with my parents before that. I
3214800	3221800	Moved out Bethany told me like I'm scared that you're gonna meet somebody new. I told her that's totally not a problem
3221800	3229120	I did end up like kind of falling for a person and there was one night where we did it's so bad
3229120	3234280	I'm so sorry, but I did get a little bit drunk and I made out with her
3234800	3236800	and
3236800	3240680	Like she it was her worst nightmare. So that's my worst
3241640	3246880	God my god, she did it anyway, and you and you forgave her. Yeah, I still love her
3250400	3252400	Think I
3252400	3254400	Don't think you have to be embarrassed for
3254560	3260560	Forgiving her. I mean like I think I think that applause means we're all in love with a bunch of people who constantly let us down
3260800	3262800	right
3264400	3266160	All right
3266160	3272320	What I don't know even why that got that reaction. Well, that's what love is. It's a it's a partnership. It's not a fucking
3272840	3274880	It's not a it's not a holiday
3274880	3276400	it's like it's
3276400	3283280	It's teamwork and life is hard and you go up and you go down and two people together go up and down at different times
3283280	3288520	And I'm not saying it's it's it should be expected or you're entitled to make mistakes
3288520	3292560	You should be punished for them and blah blah blah, but but I mean I I
3293040	3297160	Know how she feels when she goes like, yeah, I still love her. I forgive her
3308920	3312800	There's always a way for two human beings that could communicate to work these things out
3314320	3316440	So you guys seem pretty young though, are you gonna
3317680	3322520	I don't want to put pressure on something that shouldn't be pressured. Is this a serious relationship?
3322720	3327200	Yeah, we've been dating for two years. All right. Well, why don't the two of you come watch harm in town?
3328520	3331360	the movie the movie and
3333280	3338640	Maybe you'll get in because you've got the ripped one and maybe you won't and that'll that should be the deciding factor
3338640	3340640	And whether you guys stay together
3341240	3343840	All right, we'll figure it out Bethany and KD everybody
3343840	3345840	I
3347400	3350840	Think at the heart of it all shouldn't stay in anything that's bad
3350840	3356880	But you and I have a really solid good relationship or we're willing to like, yeah, we do
3357280	3362040	I I would never I would never I why don't think I
3363960	3365960	Could never
3366080	3367960	Stray from fidelity
3367960	3373320	But I don't know how much I get to pat myself on the back for that because I just don't think that's just not in
3373320	3378560	My blood I think that there are other people who are in love with each other and sometimes they have like I don't know
3378560	3384680	It's harder for them. Like I just know that from observing people like I know I never do anything
3384680	3390920	That's that difficult. Like I never like like I won't stop playing a video game to make you feel better
3392200	3394200	But I know I would never cheat
3398680	3402960	No, I'm just saying like I you know, I'm a pretty selfish guy I'm like a baby
3403320	3406920	And I'm not proud of that and I don't think that I'm allowed to be that what I'm saying
3406920	3411760	Is that I don't do difficult things just to keep my relationship going
3411760	3417160	I would do anything to keep it going, but I'm pretty bad at it. I'm pretty flawed
3417160	3419800	I'm pretty like pretty bad at
3420840	3423480	remembering in moments of selfishness that
3423960	3430520	Something that I want is isn't as important as making you happy. Well, I think we're both very flawed
3430520	3433080	But I think the good thing about our relationship is that we are
3433640	3439840	Our selves all the time. So the flaws aren't ever deal-breakers like it's always a well
3439840	3445040	You you do you're doing this shitty thing. Like I'm very messy in hotel rooms, for example. Yes
3446400	3451260	It's like the moment we go into the hotel room the entire floor gets carpeted with
3452040	3456040	Chiffon and you guys you guys are amazing. I've traveled with you enough
3456120	3461640	We could get to a hotel anywhere in the world. They will get they will check in beautiful hotel room
3461640	3466840	I can knock on their you guys store ten seconds after you got in there. Yeah, there's not a bit of
3467560	3469560	Floor that is not covered in luggage
3470280	3472280	It's me
3472880	3474880	My parents house
3475240	3479400	It's sort of like it's sort of like it being in a relationship with Jumanji
3481320	3483920	There's just all of a sudden just elephants and monkeys
3484600	3486000	Everywhere
3486000	3488000	understanding with our relationship is
3488440	3494520	Either you accept that I'm weird in hotel rooms and you can and I'll try to clean up if you ask me to clean up
3494520	3501760	You never do but if I if you did I would but the idea is well, that's a flaw of yours and I accept that
3501920	3507280	So let's move forward. The thing is like your flaws. I accept other flaws and lots of relationships
3507280	3510200	I haven't accepted their lameness. I'm sorry to interrupt
3510200	3516600	Have you seen the cut or the final cut of the film not the final cut but close to it?
3517240	3518840	Close to it. Yeah
3518840	3524280	What do you what do you think how do you think that Dan said he doesn't feel like the relationship comes off looking all that?
3524280	3532040	Like a real poster for relationships. Well, I mean, it's a it's it's not the best month in the
3533120	3535120	history of our relationship and
3535520	3542880	Dan can tell you I've gone through a lot of I mean I I was really torn up about it because with our engagement and
3542880	3544880	everything I was bummed out that
3545200	3552680	our relationship wasn't super doesn't look so super cool in the in the movie, but
3553920	3559320	It's uh, I mean it's honest. It's everything that happened. I wish there are more moments with me smiling
3559480	3566520	Yeah, I learned my big lesson from having a documentary made about me that from now on whenever I do dry humor
3566520	3572040	I'm always gonna end it with bursting into laughter and kissing someone on the forehead and saying I love you
3573080	3575080	Because that's definitely what's missing
3578120	3582520	Then it showed in the movie like I was having a good time and but it's
3582840	3587000	There's literally a moment where you're you're actually just asking me to say
3587080	3592600	I love you and I won't do it because I think it's funny and it doesn't seem funny
3593320	3599000	And I look obnoxious. I think you put it very well when you said it shows your relationship not at its best not at its worst
3599000	3601000	It's just middle ground of
3601560	3603400	what it's like it's
3603400	3609880	Yeah, I mean the trick is we got in a we got in a really bad fight early on and it was never really
3611000	3616600	Resolved and with my personality and maybe this is me being a woman or maybe it's just me being Erin
3616680	3618920	But I I wanted to talk stuff out
3619640	3624200	We didn't get to talk stuff out because you were like, can we just like let's just have fun
3625000	3627720	Like can we deal with this later? But to me it wasn't that big of a deal
3627720	3630840	But because we didn't talk to it. I thought talk about it. I felt weird and
3631480	3636440	Like you were rude to me. I have like this. I have like this like this programming in me about
3637140	3643320	relationships where I just because observing my mom and my dad I'm not using it as an excuse of saying this is my big flaw
3643880	3645880	is like I
3646280	3651960	my gender roles are based on like the guy coming home and being and trying to
3652440	3655000	Prove that there's nothing to get worked up about
3655640	3659000	And then and that the woman is going like there is a reason to get worked up
3659160	3660840	We should be you know
3660840	3667000	You should be apologizing and you should be doing something and that the guy is supposed to go. No, there is be quiet
3669000	3672600	And I it's that is the source of like all of our difficulties
3672840	3675800	I'm always trying to avoid a fight and I end up pausing them
3675880	3679720	I think I think during the tour especially and in real life and like in normal life
3679800	3684840	You're you're very conscious of being a bad boyfriend or you're very worried that you're a bad boyfriend
3685160	3689560	And most of the time when you say that I don't think that you're being a bad boyfriend and I think on the tour
3690440	3693240	You were so worried that you were going to be a bad boyfriend
3693320	3697400	Whenever I would say anything like positive or negative you'd be like, okay, come on
3698120	3701160	Do that later and I'd be like what the fuck like I just don't care about this
3701480	3702200	Yeah
3702200	3707480	But it would be about things that were positive or negative or just like hanging out and I I very much wanted to be one
3707560	3709960	of the guys hanging out, but I think
3710680	3715880	That I kept on being put in the position by you of like, come on aaron don't start anything
3715880	3720600	But I wasn't so then I got really sad and it felt lonely and weird, but I had a great time
3720840	3724220	All right. So speaking of nobody caring about this. Let's bring up spencer
3728360	3735000	Yeah, I know but wow you can so why don't you you stand anywhere you want to sit there
3736440	3738840	Whoa, what's up? Are you guys having a good time?
3741640	3743640	Is anybody drunk right now
3745000	3749560	Are we all gonna go home and seriously and securely transfer files using dropbox?
3751240	3753240	Yeah
3754120	3758600	Yeah, Lamar look at this I just made 800 dollars holy shit
3760840	3762840	That's not true I just love dropbox
3763400	3766600	Spencer and I just had lunch and you were breaking it down about bitcoin to me
3766920	3770120	Because what I didn't know is that the uh, what's the point the goxer? What the hell?
3770360	3777800	Yeah, mount mount gox mount gox are that they the big trader of bitcoins originally started off as magic card like depository
3778040	3783400	That's so awesome i'm i'm all up in magic and bitcoin i'm i'm in all of that
3785240	3789560	I dig it especially how you holding up on this trip. You haven't fun. I'm having a good time
3789640	3793000	I've been i've been more drunk here than i've ever ever been
3794680	3796200	Yeah
3796200	3801640	Yeah drinking especially spencer and I went out to uh, the mean eyed cat yesterday and uh
3802360	3804360	And uh with a little kind of country bar
3805000	3811640	Spencer on a beer and a half is the coolest spencer in the fucking world and that's spencers already really cool. I hadn't eaten in like
3812180	3816280	14 hours before like that beer was my breakfast and it was afternoon. Yeah
3816920	3822440	It's so yeah, it's like a hug from the inside. I'm the kind of drunk who like talks about how drunk they are
3822520	3826840	And that's that's terrible. I'm sorry. Yeah, i'm just so wasted but
3826840	3829160	But
3829160	3830600	But no weed
3830600	3835000	Yeah, well, that's the problem. No. Yeah, like yeah, if anybody's got a joint later around hook a brother up
3835240	3838280	Not that that's legal or anything. No, it's totally illegal. Don't do it
3838280	3843080	But we we appreciate the law and all it serves is someone just shriek weed
3844520	3845480	What
3845480	3847720	I don't what Spencer. How do you feel about this film coming out?
3848200	3851640	Because you have not seen this. I have not I have not seen it. I'm terrified
3851640	3857560	I'm told I come up. I come out. Well, but that terrifies me even more. I don't want people to like me
3859240	3862920	Yeah, it's tough. I mean you don't want people to like you probably don't want people to not like you right?
3863080	3865960	Yeah, it's it's a hard a hard balance to strike
3866600	3873320	Yeah, I just want an impossible tightrope. I want everyone to do all stuff for me without bothering me in any way
3874360	3877080	It's hard. It's hard. Well, that's what they're gonna do tonight
3877080	3880520	They're gonna watch a movie about you and love you whether you like it or not. Yeah, man
3880600	3884760	I'm gonna get so late. I mean, you're a bashful like you're kind of a
3885720	3890360	An introverted person you said bashful, but I thought you said a bath full and I was
3891000	3893160	Fucked is that you're a bit of a bathful. Yeah
3893880	3895960	Dirty water mostly some soap
3896760	3900680	I mean, but the dirt's still there what i'm trying to say is i'd like to have a bath with you later on
3901160	3904520	Uh, i'm down you're a shy guy, but you're about to be thrust into
3905320	3910440	Like some sort of at least mini stardom in this because you really do emerge as a heroic figure in this I would say
3910680	3913160	Uh, yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah
3913960	3915960	I'm a heroic figure you guys
3917400	3918760	Look at all this heroism
3918760	3922680	I mean, you're the one that goes on a journey because you get to go to new york for the first time, right?
3922760	3926920	You would never been there. Yeah, I got to look at the m&m store. We've got all
3927720	3932280	All the m&ms what's your take on the m&m store at times square. Why is there an m&m store?
3932360	3934440	I mean there's already a gas station
3938440	3940440	I don't get it
3940520	3944120	Every store is theoretically an m&m store. I mean you can get m&ms anywhere
3944760	3947720	Why would you seek out m&ms at a specific location?
3948040	3949080	Don't get it
3949080	3955960	Yeah, why would you be fans of m&ms like they're a franchise? I just love chocolate, but that extra candy coating shells
3956040	3960280	You know how when you go to las vegas you're walking down the strip and you're like, you know what honey
3960600	3963000	Can we stop for a second? I need I need a lot of m&ms
3964600	3970040	I want I just want all blue ones custom custom made custom. I want I wanted to have my initials on them
3970520	3972920	And they need to be in a seventy dollar container
3973880	3980680	Spencer what what city did you most identify with on the tour? What city did I most identify with?
3980680	3982680	What was spencer town?
3982840	3984600	I mean probably new york, right?
3984600	3989880	Because everyone just ignores you and you can tell everybody to fuck off and there's people pissing in subways
3991160	3993400	It's cool. It's cool. I don't know
3994200	3997560	It's raining. How much time do we have live? What's it? What are we looking at? It's like
3998520	4000520	605 we got
4002760	4004760	Lamar the movie's at 9 30
4005560	4007560	Well, I cut off erin to bring spencer off
4007560	4011160	I thought I thought I thought that we were gonna be up here talking about our relationship forever
4011560	4016540	Uh you you erin, let's do a new segment called erin has more to say about our relationship
4019240	4022680	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
4023640	4026600	Tenderness is a hard thing reaching out
4027160	4032840	Singling you gotta take your hand in mind. It's a team effort. It's gonna be fine together
4033800	4037960	Somebody just walked into the hotel because we're doing this in a tavern in a hotel lobby
4038120	4044600	Somebody just came to the front door and passed by the doorway to where we are and had absolutely no idea what the fuck was going
4046440	4048440	The look was one of consternation
4049160	4050360	All right
4050440	4052440	I'm here for the bitcoin cooperative
4054200	4057960	I I know I have more to say I just felt vulnerable and that I felt embarrassed
4058040	4060920	But you said speaking of no one caring and then I was like, oh no, i've done it again
4061000	4063160	No, i'm sorry. I brought down the podcast again
4063560	4066680	I was doing a bit I was doing a segue bit and I was like speaking of no one caring
4066680	4070120	Let's bring up spencer. I was trying to keep the show on the road because I thought we were running out of time
4070360	4072280	I didn't know we were in one of those holy shit
4072360	4076700	What are we gonna do for two hours about all the fun things that dan's done in austin?
4077660	4079660	Austin rap
4081420	4088300	Austin can't can't hear the music can't hear the beat to be on beat just grabbing and moving my feet
4089820	4092860	Wait for the beat. Okay now I got the beat
4094540	4100780	Dan why don't you do the rap about uh, uh finding out that you're gonna die tomorrow and all the things you want to get done
4101740	4102940	Go
4102940	4105420	Okay. All right new suggestion dark
4106380	4109260	Oh shit, uh, 24 hours
4111500	4113500	Then get in the ground
4114700	4116300	Oh shit
4116300	4118540	Ice tea is gonna die tomorrow
4119340	4121900	It's gonna spend the next day in sorrow
4122460	4129180	I got a bucket list of things to do. My name is iced tea motherfucker. How do you do? I'm from the streets
4129660	4131660	I'm from the gangster life
4131980	4136060	I fucked your mama so hard like a knife. That's gross. I'm sorry
4137100	4141580	violent imagery evocative of violence that don't do that see
4143020	4147500	Easy words to rhyme end with a o i e that's fine
4147980	4153820	For instance, if you can end a line with day, then you can say that your way or you're gay
4154620	4157020	If you end a line with the word knee
4157660	4160140	Then you could say that you bent at the knee
4160780	4163340	If you were to say you had a cup of tea
4163500	4166460	Then you could say that you saw and then you see
4167180	4169900	The key is you want to have vowels
4170460	4176220	So you can move the rap out of your bowels like taking a shit. You want it to slide out
4176780	4179420	I fucked your mama so hard. I got the gout
4180220	4183820	Rich food is austin style. I fucked your mama on the
4184600	4187340	Egyptian Nile I fucked your mama in a river
4187420	4192300	Fucked your mama on a lake fucked your mama for the march of dimes for children's sake
4192940	4198460	It was a charity fucking your mom. I fucked your mama with my friends harry and tom
4198860	4201100	Go rap outside go rap outside on the street
4205820	4209420	Okay, i'm gonna try to keep the beat i'm gonna try to do it
4209420	4213260	So many video there's so many video that you get phones out and video this right now
4213260	4220780	If the mic still works trying to keep the beat even though i'm with some jerks gotta keep the rap going on the beat

4287100	4289100	It's a lot to process
4289660	4294140	Kind of wish I was in the audience instead of in the show so I could just sit back and
4294940	4298780	Figure out what just happened. You know, all right. What's your name?
4299340	4303500	Holly holly. Yo, I saw your mama at holly's house
4304140	4310060	Doesn't matter what her name is that rhymes with mouse. That's the only word that you're gonna rhyme with

4331260	4337340	She said it out loud. It's just seems like it's improvised, but you're really just rapping
4338300	4340300	It's just it actually sucks
4340300	4342700	Jesus can't can't get it
4343500	4345500	All right
4347020	4348620	Did I really stay on the beat
4348620	4351100	I actually I turned it off just so we could hear you better
4351420	4355020	But you were right on it. I put it back on you have no idea how embarrassing it was out there
4355660	4359100	Like for real. It's just quiet like quiet and rainy
4359740	4363500	There's just people just talking to their agent on the phone and and I was just like
4364140	4369580	Fat and stupid and and they were like you're homeless and you're in jail. You're gonna go to jail
4370060	4373980	Because out there you can't hear a single thing in here. No, and you don't care
4374700	4379100	About anything in here out there. That's the world is out there. There was a guy behind
4379100	4380140	There's police out there
4380140	4383580	There's a guy behind you in a hoodie trying to look through the glass and trying to figure out what you're doing
4383660	4387660	Yeah, he looked bummed like are you are you are you the are you Ashton Kutcher?
4387820	4393260	Are you why are you allowed to do this? You're going to jail. You were a microphone away from crazy. Yeah
4393820	4399420	Yeah, thank god. I had this. I kept pointing at it. Like it's cool. It's not i'm not i'm not hearing
4399740	4401740	Things i'm not insane. I have a microphone
4402780	4406860	Also, most of those windows have posters on them that we can see out, but you really can't see it
4407580	4409500	There's only one window you can kind of see it
4409500	4414940	There's a lot of people out there doing what I was doing and they're all criminals. They're all they're all in trouble
4415180	4417180	We should give all the homeless people microphones
4418540	4420780	Yeah, or cooperative bitcoin give them
4422300	4424300	Give them a chance
4425020	4426540	I almost wonder
4426540	4429180	Nah, he smells so good. And he was so charismatic
4430220	4434700	Is he you kind of want to are you kind of wanted lamar to like really have his pulpit but
4435420	4439660	Doesn't matter. I mean he's probably gone. We don't want to keep surfing that wave. Does lamar leave
4440540	4444220	Oh, he's gone. Yeah, that suits. See now you guys feel like you should have left
4445660	4449200	All right. What's the next chapter? Um, let's play some dnd
4454700	4457100	I think spencer's probably ready for that. I guess
4457900	4459900	I'm i'm ready. I'm ready for anything
4460300	4462140	Right. I don't know
4462140	4467660	I'm not ready spencer. I I told him like, you know, maybe we'll play dnd. Maybe we want it's up to him
4467820	4471180	But yeah, because spencer you were away for a couple weeks. You didn't play dnd
4471260	4475820	We we were at spencer lists for a while. Well, I mean I should correct you. You did you did play dnd
4475900	4479660	Yeah, but we didn't play it with you and like we we oh, I know. Yeah, I know. Yeah
4480460	4485020	Also to be quite honest there's been about 17 other shows where we didn't really play dnd and you and you were there
4486140	4488940	Well, maybe we should let's fill the time while spencer gets ready
4489980	4493260	Let's let's do our pain segment our human pain segment. All right
4494220	4500460	Who's the most in pain? Well, this hand is just like up immediately. Are you willing to come up and talk about your pain?
4501020	4503740	All right. Come on up. All right. What's your name young lady?
4505740	4507900	Katie katie welcome katie to the stage would you?
4509980	4513020	Okay, there you go. I'm so happy to be here
4514460	4515900	Good to meet you. Hi
4515900	4522060	Well, you seem pretty happy for somebody that's in a lot of pain. I'm really happy harmontown. Can you I I don't have a ticket
4522140	4527660	No, step forward. I don't have a ticket. What's what's what's going on in your life that brings you so much heartache? Okay
4528860	4534460	Uh, hello everyone. I know it's disoriented because you hear you hear people. It's like being at an airport, but they're listening
4534700	4537500	Okay, there's just sort of chuffa like okay
4537820	4541420	So basically i'm gonna try to make it short just because I don't want to drag out the story
4542060	4546700	But I just remember you guys talking on the podcast about how you can very good
4546860	4549740	You can get very overwhelmed with emotion a lot in your life
4550220	4554780	And like I just remember you mentioning you wearing a suit. That's kind of like your defense
4555660	4561900	And that was something I really related to like a few years ago when I had this really big up and down thing with this one guy
4562540	4566300	Um, and it finally ended like I came to realize that like
4567020	4571900	My emotions overwhelm me so much like I don't know how to deal with it
4572380	4577660	And I feel like you guys might be able to relate to that. So I just wanted to know like how
4578300	4582060	You've lived with that through your life because i'm really lost
4582220	4586940	This is a breakup that you're still going through are you still coping with it? Um, it ended like when I was
4587900	4590860	17 or 18, but like but you keep thinking about it
4591020	4595980	Yeah, like people would always say well, you're too young to be in love like you don't know what you're thinking
4596060	4600300	You're just a teenager. But like I always told them well, you can say that but how long has it been?
4600860	4601740	Um
4601740	4603740	Since we broke up. Yeah, probably like
4604380	4605980	Five years. Oh
4605980	4607980	And I mean, I don't talk to him anymore
4608060	4612620	Really? We didn't end on horrible terms, but I pretty sure he doesn't want anything to do with me
4612620	4615740	You just keep thinking about that one relationship. You don't have contact with him
4616460	4620380	You don't have mutual friends. We do but we don't we don't see each other
4620460	4626140	Like I just I'm I know he doesn't want to be around me and that's why you dated anyone since then I did recently
4626300	4630140	Um for a few weeks at like things they were really good immediately
4630300	4633500	so we were almost just like we've been dating for like a year and then
4634060	4639020	He said he realized that but he wasn't it wasn't a good time in his life for a relationship
4639100	4642380	But I hadn't done anything wrong. So that was really comforting. Yeah, so he's lying
4643260	4649180	I was comforting but it was still kind of a big shock especially like I just said I I feel everything
4649820	4651820	very very strongly and I don't
4652220	4654220	I very I cripple under my emotions
4654540	4660940	What's the uh, is there a main emotion that you feel like is it regret or loss or separation or um, I think just
4661740	4665820	Separation from people who I feel like I just enjoy being around them a lot
4665900	4669740	But so you lost a group of friends as well when that went away. Um, no, not really
4670380	4672140	Just one person. Yeah, I don't know
4672140	4677260	I cling very strongly to people that I feel like I can connect with and then when I lose that it's just
4677660	4680540	Have you been able to have a relationship since then in the last five years?
4681020	4684060	Um, well, I just had this one recently, but it was only like three weeks
4684460	4689580	And um that ended a couple weeks ago. Is it because that other one cast a shadow over everything else or no?
4690300	4692140	No, it was other reasons. Yeah
4692140	4694940	Well that that to me. I mean, I don't know the details of it
4694940	4698460	It's it's and also i've never like i've never gone through anything like this
4698540	4700460	I wouldn't be able to like really commiserate with you
4700460	4706540	But I think the uh, the ability to feel strongly emotionally about something is the most important thing in the world
4706860	4710700	and I think that as i've grown up a little bit i've learned to
4711820	4716780	When you talk about wearing a suit the suit of armor, whatever whatever our things are that we do that we we use to keep
4717660	4719180	the world away
4719180	4720380	uh
4720380	4727900	You've learned as you as you grow up it letting people in is really dangerous emotionally and you pay a price for getting older
4728460	4731740	We all we've all paid prices no matter how old you are if you're in this room
4732620	4739980	Um, I I think i've gotten a little less emotional and much better at finding quick clever ways of keeping people at arm's length
4740540	4742940	And that does not make your life better at all
4743100	4748460	No, and I I don't want to keep people at arm's length and like after that big breakup happened when I was younger
4748620	4754220	I I felt like that Simon and Garfunkel song i'm a rock like I wanted to be that because I realized if I
4754780	4758620	Open up the floodgates to my feelings. Like I would never be able to control
4758700	4760700	It's just too much. So you cut it all off
4760780	4763820	Connecting with other human beings is is the most wonderful thing in the world
4763820	4767260	But like people have accused me of being really aloof and I can be and I am
4767820	4773420	Because it's like if I let everybody in i'm so emotionally exactly like a like a big radar antenna
4774380	4778860	For for whatever's wrong in the room. Yeah, and if I if I open up that floodgate
4778940	4781260	I will I will fall on the ground and start crying
4781340	4784700	No, i'm exactly like that. Like i'm trying to hold it together right now
4785820	4790060	You have like triggers you go back to do you have songs you listen to and pictures you look at? Yeah, for sure
4791260	4793260	I was just kidding about him lying. I don't
4795340	4800540	But I mean the great news is that you're in this really exciting time in your life where you feel
4801420	4804140	Like you said you're starting you feel like you're starting to cry
4804540	4809580	Like and that feels like a a negative emotion and I guess like definitively it is but it's also
4809980	4814060	Great because this is the time when you get to like discover new things and you should
4814620	4820460	You're going to be with other people. Yes, like claire danes says in my so-called life
4822940	4824460	God bless her
4824460	4826460	It hurts until it doesn't
4826940	4830460	so you'll if you're feeling bad right now like you'll
4831180	4833180	You'll you're going to meet other people
4833340	4837180	Like and this and this first experience like the pain of that if you're feeling bad
4837260	4842540	Like use you look like a creative person like use that energy to do as many crazy weird things as possible
4842620	4846700	But she's been hurting for five years, which at first glance is like, okay, that's that's
4847740	4850620	That's that's on the fringe of the bell curve. I mean, it's
4851180	4855580	You said that you're you've been hurting consistently for five years. I mean things were very up and down
4855580	4857580	He's a really vague person
4857980	4863500	So I would always pour my heart out to him and then maybe like yeah, I think he's become a legend in your mind
4863580	4868860	That's not really a real person anymore. Like I know I had that person. Maybe it's just really romantic like
4871260	4874860	You at this point have imagined him to be something for longer than you
4875260	4880780	Knew him which is fine and doesn't make it any less real, but it means that uh,
4881420	4888060	That you you get to free yourself from that. But i'm a big fan of I say how often are you checking in with him?
4888460	4892140	What's that? How often are you checking in with the songs and the pictures and facebook?
4892220	4898620	I mean, well, honestly, it's more it's not about this guy. It's just about me realizing that I have this like massive
4899900	4904220	Like storehouse of emotions to deal with in my life. I I say be that person
4904300	4905980	I think that the you
4905980	4911420	The price that we pay for all the all the shit that we've gone through the painful stuff the hurtful stuff the the uh
4912060	4916940	The stuff that that will never go away. It shouldn't never go away. But that's the stuff that makes you creative
4916940	4918940	That's the stuff that that's yeah
4919180	4921580	Human beings as far as we know are the only species
4922220	4927980	The that turns pain into artwork. Yes, we we we we tell stories we sing songs we
4928620	4934380	Arrange flowers. We do shit that that that's how we expiate our pain and that creates
4935100	4940780	Uh relief for other people we turn our pain like dan's a painful person. Aaron is spencer as I am
4941020	4943020	and neil as we all are
4943660	4945660	artwork is
4946380	4948380	Letting other people experience your pain
4949420	4954060	Like for them. Yes, and that's catharsis. Do you have a crowd? What are you passionate about? Um,
4954860	4956860	I kind of want to do everything
4956860	4958620	But I don't really know where to start
4958620	4962620	If that makes any sense, like I want to paint I want to do movies. I want to do them all
4963180	4967340	I want to try. Yeah, and I think your job is if you like your job is to figure out
4968060	4970380	How you would explain to a stranger?
4971340	4977820	Whether through visuals or audio or feeling or whatever how how do you transmit that pain to them?
4977820	4983740	Yes, because it can't hurt them at all. Yeah, all it can do is make them go. Holy shit. I felt that way once
4983740	4989580	Yeah, and if you felt that way for five years, that speaks well to your potential to transmit. Yeah to other people
4989740	4993500	And it's all about you. It's definitely not about this guy. I think most importantly
4994700	4998140	Focus on what makes you so cool
4999100	5003580	um, obviously like the entrance that you're going in before into the castle that is
5003980	5009020	Love and like a relationship that's like stabilized or whatever like I know I didn't get into that
5010300	5013180	quote unquote castle until uh until
5013820	5017740	until later and it was in a lot of relationships, but the like
5018700	5020700	you you get to uh
5021100	5026460	Really figure out why you're cool. Don't fall into the trap of focusing on the other person because that's easy
5026540	5029660	That's easy to focus on other people and whatever else
5030060	5032140	I mean, I think the biggest the two biggest things
5032140	5036300	I want to know is like i'm not the only person who feels completely just like
5036780	5043020	Kicked into the ground by how strongly I feel stuff. I feel like you aren't you aren't I wonder I wonder if there's anybody out
5043020	5045340	There that's ever felt actually I've absolutely
5046060	5051340	Four years past a girlfriend and i'm still constantly thinking about her. Yeah exactly what you're talking
5051340	5056940	Yeah, I mean, I just want to people like be able to feel like I feel like everybody just always has all their shit together
5056940	5059180	And i'm the only one. No, I know it has no
5063580	5067420	Well, yeah, I mean everyone fakes it like that you just got to get good at faking it
5067500	5072620	I mean, I think that's what I do. Do you bring it back up? You have songs you have pictures you look at you
5073260	5076780	No, I it was all on my old phone and I have a new phone now, but
5077660	5079660	I always I always
5079660	5082860	I get that's a good idea. That's hilarious having a new phone
5083740	5086620	Nothing's funnier than the iphone 5s gold
5088620	5091820	But yeah, no, I know what you're talking about there's nothing you could do about it
5091900	5096380	Feelings are like seasons. They just fucking happen and you either get in a house or you get wet
5096700	5101980	Yeah, I mean i've accepted that they're there. I just want to be able to like survive and turn it into something
5102700	5108060	Good and not just me like crying like I want to make it something positive. You know, like here's the thing. Wow
5108700	5110700	everyone in this room I think
5111180	5114300	Shares that with you. I think that's it's part of being a human being. Yeah
5114860	5116140	but
5116140	5118140	You're going through your own thing
5118140	5122380	Which makes us as human beings the greatest thing in the world because we all share sorrow
5122620	5128060	But we all have individual sorrow and that's the flag that you get to wave like that's that that's that that's that
5128620	5131260	That's all I got going for me right now. The danger is that you'll let
5132060	5138700	Your emotionalness that your your sensitivity that don't let that harden you don't don't put a shell up
5139340	5141980	And then become because that'll turn you that'll age you
5142540	5145740	That'll make you bitter that'll make you unhappy and it also will shut you
5146940	5153100	We're gonna stop getting the full version of katie. Yes. Yeah, like be emotional be a wreck be a weirdo
5153500	5155420	uh, like and and
5155420	5159180	Don't ever apologize for it because like i'm gonna start crying right now because it's the greatest thing in the world
5159420	5164060	And be proud that you came here and told 200 people about your feelings and what hurts you it's
5164620	5166620	They aren't hating you for it. They're digging it
5170060	5174220	Go out the crowd right now and see how many people will shake your hand high five you're a hud through right now
5175340	5179260	Yeah, take the katie. Show katie what it's like to be a fucking human thing
5180140	5181580	Yeah
5181580	5184380	And then go get a free pass with bethany because she's giving it away
5185020	5187020	I
5187020	5192460	Think I think about the things she's describing. I think about the movie. Uh, say anything with jack kuzak
5194140	5195900	Like the what's it lily taylor?
5195900	5202460	Is that the agnostic that plays the character who's who's constantly obsessed with her ex-boyfriend who keeps writing songs about him?
5203100	5203660	uh
5203660	5208540	Like she's characterized that that archetype is like oh she should get over him
5208860	5214060	But really what she should do is keep playing guitar and like like really figuring out how to get that shit out
5214140	5218860	Because one of those songs will hit like I think it is her responsibility to wipe
5219660	5222940	Her ass with the world. Uh, that's what the artist
5223180	5226700	The most empowering feeling is using realizing like
5227180	5232380	Two years after the fact someone's broken up with you and you've written all these songs and are angry and being like holy shit
5232780	5236300	This uh person that i've been getting over is a projection that I created
5236620	5238700	So now I doubly own this person. Yeah
5242460	5249340	But how do you feel about the idea that like love is the same chemical like if we don't trigger it dissipates it it's
5249660	5253980	It's a very analog thing. Yeah, it's true. But how do you I mean, how do you trigger it? I mean you
5254940	5259660	Songs and features she's not hanging out. Well, that's what yeah, I mean, I feel like no matter what
5259740	5261740	This is certainly the best dnd we've ever done
5262700	5269420	All right, are we do you think you're prepared to do a little ad hoc dnd and a noisy hotel lobby?
5271500	5274060	It's really loud over there, but you guys are so good you can hear us and everything
5275580	5279900	Also katie, thank you. That was one of my favorite hermit town moments of all time. That was lovely katie
5279900	5281900	Do you have tickets to the show?
5281900	5287420	To the documentary there. All right, i'm just gonna give away these tickets really fast. There are a couple people
5287580	5289580	I know you don't have tickets
5292300	5298860	Okay, it's exciting this is for the live crowd. I don't know what katie. Did you have tickets? Are you going to the film? Okay, cool
5301420	5303420	Those were tickets there's tickets
5305660	5311500	I feel like this is even though it's not like optimum sound and like this is not like a normal like comfort of a small theater
5311500	5313500	It's like that. Um
5313660	5318940	I I really really like what's going on with everybody. I'm in a very good, uh, harmontown mood

5439820	5441660	Okay, okay, okay
5441660	5446220	When we last met our heroes had just been released by the bone sages
5446940	5449820	by the bone sages of tormod tour
5450620	5458060	After agreeing to slay the marsh minotaur the party headed toward the party headed towards the farmer's market to look for clues
5458540	5460380	Jesus christ, is that me?
5460380	5463020	After a brief chat with joe to be cheesy
5463260	5467180	The gang went over a hill and discovered a cave covered in bones
5467820	5472620	Our heroes entered the cave despite monstrous whales coming with deep within the cavern
5473180	5475980	Within keep saying within the dark dagness
5476940	5481340	Our heroes encountered the marsh minotaur who was actually a pretty cool guy
5481980	5484380	And actually not a guy at all but a girl
5485100	5491340	After deeming the minotaur to be too honorable to be killed in cold blood the gang banded together with it
5491740	5493740	But what would they do?
5493820	5497020	How would they escape and what of their skull curse?
5497420	5502540	And what about the tarragon of virtue? Is that is that still something that people are paying attention to?
5503740	5508080	We'll find out this time. No, we won't we'll find out sometime on harman town
5508400	5510400	All right
5513680	5515600	All right
5515600	5519040	So you guys might not know what's going on but this time it's justified
5519840	5526560	Okay, so I describe the surrounding exactly what we're looking at right now. Okay, so you're in you're in this dank dark cave
5526640	5528800	It's covered in bones and feces
5529760	5535680	There's the marsh minotaur towering above you her udders in full display
5535840	5537200	Hey
5537200	5539200	She she's like hey
5539920	5542160	Hey guys marsh minotaur. You have a name?
5542800	5548240	I think I I said I had a name in our last ever. I don't what do you want to call me? Let's just uh
5549500	5556240	Meredith Meredith that was my name. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know anything about the tarragon of virtue?
5556720	5563840	Uh, I mean i've i've heard it's in paradise. I don't really I don't really know much about that. I'm just in a cave
5565680	5571920	You're in a cave. All right. Well, i'm sober as a judge and i'm not angry. You're sober. Yeah, wow
5572240	5574560	well, maybe not as a judge, but
5575760	5577760	sober is a relaxed judge
5578480	5580480	and uh, I uh, but I
5580480	5584320	Ironically, I can't hear anything. Uh, but I think that we should uh,
5585120	5586400	we should
5586400	5593860	Head out of wherever we are. Are there any exits or egress from this cave? Yeah, caves are pretty pretty straightforward
5594100	5596100	They got like one exit
5596180	5598180	Isn't it notable that Meredith isn't the
5599300	5601300	Minotaur that we were seeking after
5602980	5609220	Say again, is that a thing we were we agreed to go kill the marsh minotaur when we got out of the uh, the uh
5609780	5613940	The bone sage's tribunal. Yeah, it was part of the the terms of your release
5615700	5618660	I walked towards the entrance to the cave and say let's get the hell out of here
5619060	5624100	All right walk out of the cave and into the dusty gray darkness of the underworld
5624660	5626660	It's all dusty and gray
5627540	5632260	Over the hill, you know that the the city of tormat tor was just right over there
5632340	5634500	But I mean do you want to go back there? I don't know
5635060	5639700	You got to get out of here, right? We got to find the tarragon of virtue. How do you get to paradise?
5640020	5645140	Uh, well paradise is is above ground says meredith. It's above ground and we are underground
5645140	5647220	Don't we have a thing that can make a staircase or go up?
5647940	5652660	Yeah, you had to rape a cyber skeleton and it got destroyed in that so no you don't
5654580	5660500	You rigged a skeleton, uh, it was a cyber spider. Did I say skeleton cyber spider? Yeah. Yeah, okay
5660740	5664180	A lot of mistakes were made. Oh, you're telling me. All right, but
5664820	5669940	You walk out of the cave. I already said that you're in the dusty gray dustness of the underworld
5670900	5672900	the minotaur goes uh
5673060	5676900	You guys want to get out of here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, me too
5677220	5681060	I've been down here for too long. Jesus. I've never even seen this marsh
5681780	5685940	In in I mean I have that's where i'm from meredith. May I ride you?
5686660	5688660	No, i'm a bipedal creature
5688660	5690660	I don't get written
5690660	5695620	All right. Can I write you like piggybacks? I mean, yes, you don't do like you don't do like piggybacks or anything like that
5695620	5700660	I mean i'm sure it's possible i'm not down with that. She says while climbing upon mole range sadhana
5702180	5703860	It's very heavy
5703860	5706100	He climbs upon mole range sadhana. She does she does
5707380	5708740	to the
5708740	5713860	There so meredith is riding you right now. Yeah, I feel her udders against my back. Oh, yeah
5714820	5720180	Let's go into the marsh. Oh, there's no marsh down here. That's above ground. Is it above ground marsh?
5720260	5724420	Yeah, that's where i'm from. I just got I just got sucked down here. Have we left the cave yet?
5724660	5728260	Yeah, we're in the the underworld. We're in the dusty dark grayness. Yeah
5728900	5730180	You know you guys
5730180	5735460	I don't know this but i'm assuming you guys must have fell down here along with a castle. Oh, yeah
5735540	5740260	We we we killed admiral darkstar and the castle all collapsed and we killed a bunch of people
5740340	5745300	We got a lot of trouble for it. So there's a hole in the ceiling, right? Maybe we can get out of that hole
5746500	5750740	A hole to climb up out of all right. I climb up. I climb up the hole
5750900	5754340	You're not you're not by the hole because you you trek quite a long way
5754740	5760180	Right. We went to skeleton town and got accused of all kinds of things. Oh, yeah, it was it was not fun
5760340	5764340	Let's walk back towards the uh, the hole entry. Sure. Yeah, that's happening
5765140	5770100	Uh as you tread through the dusty darkness you see your footprints that lead to the city
5770260	5771940	Those were the footprints you did, you know
5771940	5774340	You made when you were walking towards the city that one time
5774820	5779460	You also note a pair of wolf-like footprints like like that of a wolves
5780580	5783380	Like that of two wolves maybe more than two wolves
5784020	5786020	much newer than your own
5786420	5788900	And then you reach the crumbling ruined castle
5789300	5790820	But all is not right
5790820	5797940	You see the dark stone blocks of dark stars forest are faded with age and look to be crumbling to dust as if they've
5798180	5804420	Endured millennia of history the dark stone blocks. They're just crumbling all over the place
5804740	5810420	Brilliant sunlight streams down from the hole in the ceiling hundreds of yards above your heads
5810740	5812740	Is it climbable the surface of the hole?
5812980	5814740	Bar bar
5814740	5818740	Quiet we're doing we're doing important work over here. I don't think I don't know if anyone else has
5818900	5823460	Having the same feeling but I know when I was in high school and used to play games like this in a cafeteria
5823860	5829860	It was identical to this like keep I mean, let's be loud, but not so loud that they come over and yell at us
5830500	5832900	With a bar bar. I don't think anyone's gonna yell at us
5833140	5836980	Everyone at the bar everyone at the bar help us out. Please. I really don't think that's gonna work
5838180	5841700	Use a rap song. There's other shitty bars to go to go to those
5842340	5844660	Well, that's true. There's a lot of lovely bars in austin
5845620	5849780	Yeah, all right. Well, what's happening? We head towards the goddamn hole on the ceiling
5849780	5851780	I'm gonna go sit at the bar and do this with a like you said
5852740	5855060	You head up i'm gonna play i'm gonna play at the bar
5859620	5862740	I'm gonna confront these assholes all they've learned that i'll do it
5863380	5866340	All they've learned is that when that happens they get to sell their products
5867700	5870660	That's the only precedent we've set right here
5871540	5875480	These loud motherfuckers, all right, go ahead i'm gonna stand next to this newsy
5879300	5884500	All right, I go to the uh, I start climbing the side of the hole there's no side of the hole
5884580	5888180	Are you guys doing there's a imagine if there's a hole in the ceiling of this very
5888660	5893060	Building like you couldn't just climb up into thin air. I know i've asked you this a thousand times
5893060	5897140	But it's my sun rod. That's that stick with the button. That's like a flashlight
5897700	5904660	The button staff got destroyed. That was the thing that got destroyed. All right fine the the Meredith she speaks up. She's like, oh
5905540	5910420	Man, that's a that's a big hole. You need some sort of crazy ridiculous ladder to get up there
5910580	5915460	Yeah, or a teleport cape. Yep, which I have that's cool
5916480	5920100	Teleport cape you teleport to the surface
5920420	5922420	Capity do
5925700	5929780	So, uh sharpies is above on the surface world
5930580	5932660	At the rim of this hole alone
5933380	5935380	I I use my springy shoes
5935860	5942200	You're what now? I have shoes of springing. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you jump 20 feet straight into the air
5942440	5944440	Oh
5945720	5950360	I try to reach down and the hole is 700 yards deep
5953880	5957000	I have a escape artist. Can I escape out of where I am to the top of the hole?
5957720	5960840	Not without it a solid plan or some way to ascend
5961620	5963620	700 yards
5963800	5966200	I mean if you're by escaping as an artist I
5967460	5969480	artistically
5969480	5974520	You draw a depiction of your brilliant escape. Yes, I do. It doesn't happen though
5974600	5978040	I'm coming back to the stage because you know what? It's not that loud over there. It just sounds loud
5978280	5981160	I know. Well, that's the thing. I think it's the high ceilings either
5981720	5987560	uh, i'm i'm i'm looking around for materials on the surface world to see if there's a way that I could like
5988840	5996200	Make a 700 meter ladder. It's frozen tundra. There's no vegetation or anything as far as the eye can see in fact
5996440	6003080	There's not a climbing kit. Can I climb out? Uh, your climbing kit does include rope, but it's only 150 feet of rope
6003160	6009480	It's not quite enough. If you call down to me, I think I can make a ladder. I have rope and uh supplies and uh,
6009800	6014280	Hey make a ladder you do but it's it's less than 700 yards of ladder
6015240	6021240	Meredith again again speaks up. I like I actually have a ladder you have it
6022200	6024200	Yeah, yeah, I have it
6024360	6029000	I mean if I take this with me this viral acid, can I have a visual that i'm out of the cave?
6030120	6032600	No, it's like burning killing you ass. Oh, it's not like
6033480	6037800	Can I use the liar of building to get us out of here? Uh, you could but it takes some time
6038040	6040040	Meredith just said she has a ladder
6041000	6042440	I do
6042440	6048200	Several hundred foot ladder. Oh, yeah, this is like a ridiculous ladder. Oh, let's use the ladder. Can we use your ladder?
6049000	6053400	I mean, I don't have it with me, but trust me. It's like crazy. We're talking we're talking
6053720	6057160	It was forged in the pits of skaldor by double giants
6057640	6061080	She says she has a ladder, but it's not with her. It's forged in the pits of skaldor
6061240	6063240	I might have jumped the gun on this teleportation
6064520	6066520	Hey
6066600	6068600	Is there a coffee place over there?
6068600	6070680	No, just a bunch of snow. All right. Um
6071320	6075800	Meredith where's the ladder? I'll go get it. It's back in the cave time passes
6076120	6080520	While you while you while time passes you guys should talk about your your greatest fears
6081480	6088520	She runs into the darkness. All right. Okay commitment. I imagine that i'm at an afternoon party
6089320	6096520	And and someone says let's let's let's create something really cool and I reach in my pockets and I look at my hands and their
6097160	6099000	pool cubes
6099000	6101000	It's my greatest fear. I like really
6101800	6105000	I'm going first. My greatest fear is her telling that story again
6105000	6110680	Okay, kiddie kiddie it's common
6113960	6115560	A serious relationship my greatest fear
6116840	6118840	my great my greatest fear
6119000	6120600	pumas
6120600	6126840	Sure, it's fair. Yeah, merideth comes back. She's carrying a crazy ladder. It's like crazy
6127560	6130680	I help merideth, uh put the ladder up right so we can get up there
6130760	6135080	Very difficult to do that because this ladder is 700 yards long
6135160	6139400	I use my barbarian strength to help the ladder get up as hard as it is
6139400	6144280	It is in fact possible and you accomplish this task the ladder it sets up
6144840	6150360	She's like we best climb this but don't worry. I mean, yes worry, please be worried
6151080	6153080	It is a crazy ladder
6153080	6156120	What sort of craziness might happen like you might go crazy?
6156120	6158120	I
6158360	6162840	I don't give a shit. I'm a barbarian. I start climbing the ladder. All right. I'll hold the top
6163400	6168200	You start climbing the ladder and as you ascend you see you see pumas
6168840	6171160	Pumas on the ladder pumas pumas
6173240	6174600	Pumas
6174600	6177480	You're terrified. You can't you can't move you're just stuck on this ladder
6177640	6183560	I say i'm stuck on the ladder about 10 feet up. You see you you see your friend court climb 10 feet up the ladder
6183640	6186360	I i'm plus 10 against pumas
6187560	6191000	Wait, what no, i'm kidding. I was paying attention to the side conversation going on
6192200	6197560	I failed my will save on that one or you sure did quark. You sure did and you're seeing pumas guys
6197800	6200600	Get off this ladder pumas everywhere. We're all gonna die
6200840	6202840	We don't see any pumas. There's no pumas
6203720	6205880	This ladder is fucking lousy with pumas
6207000	6210440	I I I stab quark in the thigh with a dagger
6211320	6213320	You can't reach that high he's 10 feet up
6213400	6217000	Okay, so I do it and then I pretend that it was a joke and I put it in my pocket
6217960	6219400	You do that
6219400	6221400	It does come off like a joke
6224120	6226120	Everything's fine you guys
6226520	6228520	What does someone else want to do shot?
6228840	6233400	Can I use a spell on him? That's like from from this high up
6234040	6236840	Uh, if I have for instance, oh, I don't know
6237880	6239160	uh
6239160	6240680	for instance
6240680	6242680	a little thing called
6243000	6245000	Cause fear. No, that won't work
6245640	6247400	promise
6247400	6251720	If I have a poison dagger, can I take care of them with that if I were to use a charm person?
6251880	6257240	Could I could I just make him happy enough to climb a ladder and stop caring about pumas?
6257320	6260520	No, he'd just be a good friend of yours. That was also terrified
6261160	6266680	But he would he would he wouldn't it wouldn't overcome his fear of no, it would be like he's feeling both of those things
6266680	6271960	He'd get real confused and horny probably. Um, Meredith. I shoot them with my poison daggers. Say again
6272520	6276840	Shoot them with my poison daggers. So what the pumas? They're not real pumas
6278280	6280280	Yeah, you see no pumas
6280280	6284520	Meredith what's the deal? What's the deal with these with these hallucinations? How do we get past that?
6284600	6288680	It's just a crazy ladder. You gotta finish your fears. Meredith, why would you offer us a crazy ladder? I'm sorry
6288680	6291400	Do you have any 700 yard long ladders? I'm sorry
6291480	6294200	Why are you going along with us on this journey if you don't want to help us?
6294760	6300840	Uh, because I want to go back to the marsh. I start kissing Meredith's neck. She's not comfortable with it, but she allows it
6305160	6309480	Guys i'm getting killed by pumas up here. Yeah, you feel you feel puma claws
6310120	6316040	Slashing into your flesh. Can I use my fast stealth to climb the ladder? Yes, stealthily. I do that
6317640	6320600	You climb up you seem like no one can see you
6321240	6325640	You get you get to quark and you you can even climb over him without him noticing you
6326200	6330680	There's pumas everywhere. Not really you get 30 feet above him and then you see
6331560	6334680	A very aggressive looking woman on the ladder climbing down
6335720	6340840	It's your mother. We gotta go to dinner. We are late. What are you wearing? Are you kidding me?
6342520	6344520	This is the big day
6346360	6348360	Fine that's what the ladies say indeed
6349240	6353880	So it's terrifying wait, if you're not getting that from my reading do I have to get past her?
6354120	6357960	I mean you have to deal with it. Do I have to overcome this emotionally? I don't know man
6358920	6360920	Probably probably
6361880	6363640	I start climbing up the ladder
6363640	6369640	You climb up the ladder and you climb and you climb you get right up to where quark is and it seems like the ladder is
6369720	6372120	On it's just like it's broken
6372120	6377160	It's a bit it's a bit cracked and messed up if you could only repair it with like your craft skills
6377560	6381320	I've got to I've got to reach into my pockets and then there's nothing in your pocket
6387160	6391480	I leap off the ladder head first into the cave that happens
6393960	6395960	The fuck is going on down there
6396680	6401560	Just climb up the ladder. This is a crazy ladder sharpie. You land you land head first

6435480	6440440	Uh, no, you're about 10 feet. No 20 feet above him, but it's still you know, several hundred feet
6440920	6444920	We got a long way to go. Yeah, and there's fucking plumbers you guys it's all over the place
6444920	6449560	So I keep climbing the ladder. Yeah with your significant other who keeps haranguing you
6450740	6453560	Incestantly wow, especially you're really hitting home here. I know
6454360	6456360	It's terrifying, isn't it?
6456680	6462280	Oh man, she's just going on now. She's being passive aggressive. Why am I why am I with someone?
6462360	6464840	You're doing a really great job climbing up the ladder
6465800	6467800	Great, you're so strong
6467880	6470920	You're nothing like uh, you're everything like my guy friend
6472040	6477400	I built a fire up here. Uh campfire. Okay, that happens
6478040	6481560	It's very soothing and starts to warm your cold bones
6482680	6485560	I keep I keep trying to press on because i'm so scared of the pumas
6485560	6491320	I use that fear attack to to climb away running away from the pumas. They slash at your belly and back
6491880	6493880	You take uh some damage of some sort
6494840	6496840	Seven damage is your fake pumas
6497240	6503160	I mean are they no. All right. Ah, I keep climbing. Oh my god, you get you get 80 feet up
6503240	6505240	You're pretty far up. All right
6505240	6507960	Am I away from my am I away from my puma on your back?
6509080	6511080	You got no idea spencer
6512200	6517880	Oh cool meal, is that a stain on your shirt me you're like jackson pollock you're gonna be the coolest guy at this party
6518680	6520680	Great don't change
6521480	6523480	Oh
6523480	6525480	I tell her i'll be in the car
6526840	6531800	When she's ready, yeah, she's she's like you always say that
6533400	6535400	But then she doesn't speak anymore
6539320	6541640	Uh, yeah, that's all it takes
6542680	6547160	Sometimes moolane is writing on the floor, right? Yeah. Yeah in pain
6548520	6551000	uh, I I take out my uh
6551400	6553400	a dagger
6553800	6555000	And I
6555000	6557000	I put it on the ground
6557240	6560600	That's my move. All right, you place the dagger
6561240	6563240	gently on the ground
6563320	6565320	Or not gently whatever you want
6565800	6570200	What uh, what does other people do? I keep climbing you keep taking puma damage
6570600	6571560	I don't give a
6571560	6576360	Now the puma's been on my back so long now. It's become like a scarf like i'm getting used to this puma
6576600	6580040	It is kind of warm. Yeah, you get a hundred feet up as as
6580520	6584440	Christopher also keeps climbing you guys are maybe halfway up the ladder
6586760	6590680	Oh, well I I climb too. All right, but as you climb up
6592040	6594280	It's fine. Like you don't seem anything anymore
6594760	6599720	It's almost as if the slip disk might have deactivated some part of the delirium factor
6600600	6602600	That's how vertebrae works
6603480	6605640	That's what kyripe actors would tell you. Yeah
6606280	6608840	No, that's yeah. I think I got the idea. I'll cure a cold
6610120	6615640	That's true. That's true. I we all keep climbing up you keep climbing up and you keep taking puma damage. I
6617560	6619560	It's not fun
6619560	6622440	Imaginary puma damage that's my current pitch for the name of the episode
6624040	6629240	You get you get more than halfway up you guys are all the way almost up mohrain's trailing behind
6629320	6635320	She's a bit slow because she has a slip disk. That's very painful. If anyone's ever experienced that it hurts a lot
6637160	6638200	Yeah
6638200	6643960	You keep climbing and you keep climbing and mohrain you see you see quark
6644760	6649400	He's covered in gash marks like uh, like, you know, he's bleeding heavily
6649800	6654040	Like he should be like it's making the ladder slippery. It's hard hard to deal with
6654760	6657080	Bro, you're bleeding. I know this is pumas
6658600	6664280	Puma damage. I I miss that girl and I play everything I do by petera
6664520	6666520	Okay
6666520	6672120	You feel uh contemplative or something I honestly didn't hear what you just said
6674520	6680040	I keep climbing. Yeah, you keep climbing and bleeding bleeding all over the ladder
6681320	6686040	But you get you get to where neil is. I mean christoper these three quarters up
6686280	6690440	Close me to the top. Are we you're very close. You're pretty close
6690920	6695320	You're you're not quite close, but you're almost getting to pretty close
6697000	6700760	Can I use my climbing kit now or am I 150 away? Yeah, you can lash
6700760	6703960	I use my climbing kit. It makes it so much easier
6704040	6708040	You have no risk of falling off the ladder and with your newfound confidence
6708120	6712520	You just soar to the top and and see sharpie. He's made of fire
6714280	6716280	I've made a fire
6716520	6718520	Of course you would need help
6720200	6721800	That happens
6721800	6728280	I I go into a barbarian rage to shrug off these uh these perceived pumas and I and I and I use all my
6728580	6734120	Barbarian powers to climb up the final way raging like a barbarian you attempt to climb the ladder
6734760	6738760	Raging like a raging person with anger problems might climb a ladder
6739720	6742440	Uh, yeah. Yeah, you climb it you're bleeding
6743400	6747960	You're bleeding and climbing you get to the top and you see you see a fire
6749080	6751080	and sharpie and christoperd
6752680	6757240	Hello are we all up here is with moorain still moorain still coming up moorain get up here
6758200	6764200	Okay, can I throw her down with the climbing tool? Yeah. Yeah, you can lower your climbing kit. I do that
6765000	6767000	She will you I try to catch it with my mouth
6767800	6769800	Yeah
6769800	6775080	Yeah, you catch it right in your mouth. What did you roll a 20? I rolled a 15. Jesus christ
6775160	6777480	It was dropping straight down, you know
6779000	6780520	Right in the teeth
6780520	6782840	All right. I get the climbing kit and I swallow it
6783720	6789240	It's it's very large to swallow like you can't even okay. I gag on it. I take it out. Uh
6791240	6793240	I put it in my back pocket
6793720	6798840	And I start climbing up the ladder again, you keep climbing up this slick bloody ladder
6799320	6802920	Oh, she lost her mind a few rounds ago guys. I'm, uh committed to this
6804280	6809080	The the ladder is bloody and it's slippery. Okay, so the ladder is bloody I uh,
6809720	6811720	I decide I want to become a shadow
6812200	6816200	So I cover myself with all the blood that I can find so i'm as dark as possible
6817240	6819240	that happens
6820120	6823000	And like carrie I rise
6824680	6826680	The rope ladder
6826680	6829640	I mean what I I never saw carrie
6830200	6834680	Uh, she's covered in blood spencer. Oh, I I got that pictures of carrie. You've seen gifts
6835720	6842680	Gifts do but you understand the concept of carrie. Oh, yeah, she's like a girl and she doesn't have friends and then she kills herself
6843720	6845720	Uh, well what happens now what happens?
6846680	6854200	She gets she gets teased and covered in blood and then she she kills everyone because she's teased. Well, that's a triumphant story, right?
6854760	6856280	I I think so
6856280	6861800	I saw carrie and I was like I I was carrie. Most of my friends were carrie. Uh, so I cover myself
6861800	6863800	I'm blood like carrie. Uh-huh
6864200	6866200	It makes it really even more slippery
6868840	6870840	So that happens or yeah, yeah, definitely
6871400	6874520	Small rain. Are you coming up or what? I don't know man. I'm confused
6875240	6879160	I'm covered in blood. I I continue to climb with the ladder you continue to climb
6880440	6883240	Using the climbing kit to secure your ascent
6883800	6889720	You get to the top of the ladder and you see all of your good friends surrounding a fire
6890440	6892440	We made it to the top of the ladder
6897720	6900840	That was harder than it looked next week we're gonna pay our gas bill
6901720	6908920	The merideth also climbs the ladder and she crests the top and gets up there with you guys. Thanks for all that help

7173960	7176600	I really appreciate that. I was making some friends of ours and uh,
7179880	7181880	It's a great film
7182840	7190120	Uh, second my question is for spencer, um, do you have a lot of offers for like to go to different conventions and dm games for them?
7190760	7192760	No
7193560	7196760	I that's all I mean you'd think there'd be some of that
7197960	7199960	Take note that i'm complaining
7202120	7206520	Thank you, sorry, how about who's over working any uh
7206520	7208520	Yeah
7210200	7212200	Over here, please

7218120	7219560	Yo
7219560	7221560	This guy's gonna ask a question
7224040	7227900	You still got it, you know, did you quit drinking?
7231640	7233400	Ever maybe no
7233480	7238360	No, i'm just saying it scared the shit out of me because I kept seeing the bottom line. Oh shit. I see where this is going
7239000	7246360	Yeah, like this is like a anti-alcohol thing. But then I realized oh god, it's kettled wine. They're paying for this. So cool
7248120	7250120	This guy loves alcohol
7250120	7255880	Or does he was that an ironic copy? I think he's happy to be still drink. Yeah, I don't think he'll pay for it
7257720	7259720	They certainly paid for
7259720	7264280	All of my uh self abuse over the years or was that guy just asking for a free drink?
7264680	7267640	I don't know. We'll never know. I think the audience includes. Yes
7270040	7272040	Yeah, I've paid for it
7278520	7281000	Thank you, honey, that was the world's worst mic drop
7282360	7284440	You can't do it. Well, she doesn't want to pay for that
7284440	7288280	I don't want to once they dropped the mic and then I had to pay for the mic afterwards
7289160	7292840	Because it wasn't that kind of thing. We might have to pay for it. I'm very sorry
7295080	7297080	We love me
7297080	7300920	Question over here. Uh, dan, uh, thank you for everything the show
7301640	7306200	Helping me win 65 bucks. Uh, all that how about explain yourself?
7307560	7313640	They did that pub quiz a couple weeks ago and uh, our team won 300 bucks at least win six ways
7313640	7317880	So I got 60 bucks 62 bucks out of that. Congratulations. Thank you
7318440	7320440	Um, where is it?
7327480	7329160	So, uh
7329160	7333880	During the filmmaking process. Did you realize that spencer was the hero or was it after dan's?
7335080	7337320	Revelation at what point do you realize?
7338040	7340760	You know, uh, you can see me in the movie
7341400	7344920	The exact point where neil puts it in that's the point where I kind of realized it
7345080	7351320	I mean, it's it's both tongue in cheek and tongue out of cheek where those expressions made I I I was
7351640	7357800	There's 650 hours of footage neil had to deal with the fact that his documentary subject is a guy who thinks he knows
7358200	7360520	At a minimum time what point the story they're at
7361080	7367000	So there's a lot of stuff on the cutting room floor of me explaining that we're crossing the threshold when we're not at all
7367480	7369720	Uh, it was up to neil in the end
7369960	7375720	It was this movie, but it was it was important for me to realize at a certain point that uh, okay
7376360	7381720	Nothing's really happening to be transformed. I'm going to be an asshole by the end of the story
7382280	7388280	Uh, and I didn't I didn't realize that that exact point in the tour where it comes in the movie
7388520	7391320	Like I made that vlog entry
7392280	7394920	I wanted to help the documentary, but it was true
7395800	7398360	Just said unexpected to the hero focus on him
7399320	7404280	But also, uh, you know erin erin told me at one point I remember
7405160	7409960	Watching early cuts and having nausea about what a dick I looked like
7411160	7414600	I was just I don't know like neil was having trouble finding the story
7414600	7419320	I think he needed to have one, but if you try to tell a story about me for footage about me
7419480	7421720	It's just the darkness is going to be too dark
7422440	7427480	Um, et cetera, et cetera, and I remember erin telling me like just tell the people about Spencer
7429000	7434200	But it's obviously the thing like like and I did tell me all that and I didn't tell me
7434840	7436840	I deal with errors because uh
7437480	7439880	Because neil was going through the forest while shooting us
7443000	7445000	Again
7450280	7455800	But it was her idea and uh, I think it was definitely the thing like the journey with Spencer
7456680	7458680	Um, that was that was the thing saving grace
7459240	7461720	neil instead of interviews like like the things
7462200	7466040	Like that footage of me in the bathroom like drunken battling
7466600	7471480	But I do I think realizing that Spencer's journey was the backbone while I was going to be
7472520	7476520	You know, just i'm just an asshole. I'm just i'm an asshole at the end. I'm an asshole at the end
7477880	7480040	Spencer in the meantime goes across the threshold
7483000	7485000	Thank you
7485240	7487240	You're welcome
7489320	7497640	Uh, yeah, um, uh shaker so much. I don't know why just like everyone in that movie. Um, first off fantastic movie
7497720	7502520	Um, uh, I the podcast uh, my life has been pretty crazy in the last few years
7503000	7505960	Um, and podcasts have been my favorite discoveries every monday
7506280	7507800	I get up at like 5 a.m
7507800	7512280	To go to work and it's it's there and I listen to it and what I appreciate it
7512280	7515480	It's not funny, but there's a lot of times it talks about really serious things
7515960	7518360	Um, and extensively it takes all its time
7518360	7524520	And like like one time you talk about religious cults like you've watched a documentary about that and like I grew up in a religious cult
7524840	7529000	And so it's like they hit really close to home and a lot of things are being said was like
7530280	7536760	Wow, it's like it's like someone who's like who is even there kind of understands this or at least has the ability to talk about it
7537160	7540360	um at one point in the show that um
7541320	7545240	What point did you feel like that comfortable to be like, okay
7545240	7547080	This show has the comedy elements of it
7547080	7554360	But we want to talk about serious topics and we feel free to go back and forth between comedy and and serious
7554680	7557800	Whatever that it really means the first time I failed to go
7559000	7563500	Get over that and i'm dishonest enough to cope with that. I'm going maybe it's not happening
7563500	7565500	That we're doing now
7566220	7573500	How many show implies that you have an axe and that you have material that you are prepared for paying audiences we don't have one
7573900	7575900	we found that uh
7576540	7578060	I think pretty quickly
7578060	7579740	Dan said let's do a show
7579740	7585340	And not them because what was just they offered me a slot. Let's do a thing where we colonize the moon
7586220	7592380	um ours isn't really a comedy show it's funny, but I think that when we're being our funniest is when there are
7593340	7594780	moments when we're
7594780	7596780	connecting with strangers
7597020	7603580	And there's always going to be comedy out of that when it's sincere. So our best our best moments are
7604220	7608940	human moments with strangers when our shows become this beautiful muppet show
7609900	7612220	full of weirdos that are all you know
7613100	7615100	Could all have their own show
7615420	7619660	But lastly, I got the most important thing for the show. Thank god
7619900	7621900	Yeah
7621980	7625580	They are mostly it's about Dan's beautiful ability to freestyle around
7627180	7629180	Amen
7638780	7640780	So my
7641580	7643580	Thank you
7643900	7649500	My parents went through a drug rehabilitation program that became a religious cult and my dad was like second in command
7649820	7654380	But then he started drinking and then he got an accident to kill two people and they went to prison
7654620	7656860	And then he really just told turned on my entire family
7661420	7663420	Great documentary
7663420	7665420	Yes
7665740	7667740	Are you
7667900	7672460	Yeah, I mean I want to be a filmmaker and I also want to tell the story are you okay?
7673020	7675020	My dad just got a prison two days ago
7676620	7680460	And uh say that night it's like that day. I got my dad
7681180	7683180	He's setting
7684140	7686140	So
7694940	7696940	His name is Lamar
7705820	7708540	That morning I worked with the Austin Post Society
7708540	7713340	They had the bigger film awards and they and I was two feet away from johnny death at one point
7713580	7716060	So in the morning I did my dad in prison
7716220	7720940	He's been there for six and a half years that night two feet away from jonita two days later
7720940	7727020	I'm right next to everyone who's part of my favorite podcast and it's it's nuts, you know
7727900	7729900	All right
7737500	7740540	I worked there at that building and I was out of town
7740620	7744300	And it broke my heart and I rushed all the way back to town just so I could see the screen
7744460	7747900	I wouldn't have given anything to have been there in fact, you know, but my
7748620	7753660	Friends are dandy over there. He was on the show I heard, you know, so that to make more than except for me
7754620	7756620	Okay
7771180	7773180	Thank you some oh jeez, there's a lot of people here
7774700	7776700	I didn't think
7784620	7786620	How can you
7794140	7798060	Do you came up with the uh, the live podcast that we did
7801100	7803100	He was here before me please
7803740	7805740	It's
7811100	7816380	First of all, I just I just wanted to thank government for putting your story circle stuff up on channel 101
7821900	7823900	From that what the grammar
7825900	7829260	No, it's great, I mean i'm looking for anything I can any help I can
7830220	7832380	So I have a question for meal
7833340	7840060	I thought it was a really interesting choice the way that you tease these what sounds like sort of uncontrollable anger
7840620	7841900	issues that
7841900	7843180	Dan has
7843180	7848220	But to never actually show any of it and with 650 hours of footage i'm sure that you had some so
7848780	7850780	Could you just talk a little bit about that?
7851420	7853420	Not really. No
7856140	7858380	I want to say it happens in den
7859180	7861180	said I wish
7861260	7865820	I always said I wish that more of my camera while i was doing that are behaving that way
7867980	7872940	The worst I get is with the person that's supposed to work with me with erin and I think that's
7873580	7879580	What is that feels good that that comes across in the film because that's a crime I do commit but
7880780	7882380	I don't
7882380	7885260	I don't throw things. I don't I don't I don't hurt like
7886220	7891260	People or anything it's it's like I go from being a big glue
7892060	7894060	Thumb-sucking asshole to being
7894780	7898380	You know kept facing inside. I go. I just I just get me
7899340	7899980	uh
7899980	7905820	because people aren't giving me what I want and and and erin bears the brunt of it and I
7905820	7907820	The film touches on that
7908620	7910380	I don't know
7910620	7914540	The conversation it's a conversation and there was a moment where I said
7915660	7917900	Uh dan, but what is the worst?
7918460	7923100	What is the worst part of you do your things? What would make them not line up to do your autograph?
7923900	7925900	What can make them say?
7926140	7928460	Maybe this is a bad guy and he said
7929420	7931740	Okay, this is how I've been getting a relationship and jeff
7932380	7935260	Says that the jeff says you brought a delicious tears
7936060	7938060	You you you brought these things up
7938060	7942700	So it was never captured on camera, but it was a discussion we had so
7943340	7949100	To me that was like if there's a low point there's a there's a scary moment. What is it about dan? His fans?
7950140	7955340	Might not know about or might need to know about and it's this behavior. Yeah
7956300	7958700	That stuff's all real and there's a real
7959980	7963020	Petty competitive party that wants to really hammer that home
7964540	7965820	but
7965820	7967340	that said
7967340	7968460	I
7968460	7974940	In their relationship with my hero. I mean this person that you guys all look up to I look up to him
7975100	7980300	just as much like I I I published a book with all this writing and I
7981100	7983580	admire I I did all the merch I
7984300	7986300	I really admired this person
7986540	7991260	Morso and just a boyfriend like I really look up to him and I asked him for advice
7991660	7996700	And I asked him for life advice and when I get set in a relationship i'll say to him
7997180	7999180	I'm I'm not sad because I feel
7999820	8003420	Like you were shooting earlier like how do I deal with that?
8004220	8006780	And he gives me advice in that way most of the time that works out
8007420	8012380	That's the tour like it's all accurate, but it's it was a it was a weird
8012540	8015100	It was a weird time for us because I think dan felt like
8016060	8017100	not to
8017100	8020300	Put this on you, but it seems like over the that month
8020380	8023580	It felt like you were you were maybe assuming that I was doing some work
8023820	8026860	But I I'm so i'm the luckiest person in the entire world
8026940	8031580	Like I was watching the movie and i've seen it before crying thinking about how lucky I am
8031980	8035740	How many of us are able to say I really look up to the person that I'm with
8036300	8039180	Like I look up to him like he's a professor or
8039980	8041980	a father
8043260	8045660	He's my father totally gross
8046620	8053100	No, no, he's not he's not my father, but I really I really look up to he's not my he's not actually not literally my father
8056060	8057660	No, I mean I I
8057660	8062620	I admire him and I also admire because he he supports me more than anyone else in the world
8062700	8065340	Like I really love him so much. Don't be mistaken
8065980	8070140	There's no he's not taking any favors by the thing with me. I'm incredibly shitty
8070700	8073740	On the morning, I'm not so teased all over my face and my body
8075740	8082380	I am equally obsessed. I am I have told dance and secrets about my body this last two weeks and i've really shocked him
8082700	8084700	We're perfect. Yeah
8084700	8086700	It's like David Ithaca
8089100	8091100	What was this did for sure right?
8091100	8096540	I don't know, but she's taking a documentary about hers or I could be out of focus in the background pushing a shopping cart
8097500	8101500	It's called my documentary is called, uh, McGaffy case
8103180	8105180	Short Lamar everybody
8109260	8113100	So first of all, I want to know who's the best smelly man in Austin
8113100	8115100	That's you sir
8115100	8118860	You fish for that a little bit. Oh, he didn't say she he just took his shirt very far
8120060	8122060	Oh
8122060	8124060	That is how it's going you might not smell that good
8127100	8129100	Do you like
8130780	8132780	That was delicious for us
8134540	8139340	No, but seriously, I was back there watching the movie I came here late and I started
8140060	8142060	You didn't see the worst man ever
8143100	8145100	Listen, listen, I don't know
8145100	8148380	Are we willing to believe anything about it? No, seriously, no i'm dead serious
8149020	8151020	I don't listen i'm being dead serious
8151020	8153100	And it started because I got pinpointing
8153340	8156300	No, no, no, no, no, no, I started tearing up man
8156700	8161100	Because let me tell you why because I realized how amazing my freaking life is, right?
8162140	8166800	No, no, because I did not realize you used to do the creative community
8172540	8174540	Thank you
8176780	8180940	Like I just like the creativity I like creation like I don't try to remember like this
8183900	8185580	No, i'm not I promise i'm back
8185580	8188860	But seriously, so I started tearing up because I was like, are you kidding me?
8188860	8194620	Like I got caught up on stage by the dude who created the show that I love the most
8194940	8197840	You know what i'm saying? Which season? So every season
8198620	8200620	No, listen, don't say anything
8200860	8202860	Don't say any season
8205740	8207740	Who did this?
8208700	8210700	Oh
8212300	8214300	You couldn't say any other season
8222060	8224060	Here's the question
8226060	8228880	I don't know man. So so where's my question, man?
8238700	8243100	Period I like the month and see this is a better documentary right now. I like it
8247340	8249980	I like it because of the last song of the show
8252860	8254860	So it's like
8268700	8269900	Yes
8269900	8271420	Because I love my life so much
8271420	8275900	So how did it feel when I was watching the show like how did it feel to?
8276460	8281500	Get on the show with carment town and just be plucked out of like I watched that part
8281580	8285180	You said that but I mean you probably want to get a word in right now
8285260	8290140	So i'm going to ask you a question. How did it feel to just be like plucked out of like
8291020	8295180	Nowhere and to become like a really loved individual, you know
8297740	8299740	Mark
8303260	8304540	I mean
8304540	8309340	It felt a lot like not that happened. It felt like it didn't like nothing happened
8309900	8313180	For a long time. I was just kind of going with the flow and I wasn't really
8314040	8320460	Understanding I didn't even think of myself as a part of heartland town because you know a heart of people come up on stage
8320860	8324700	Thinking that audience members do I was an audience member that came up on stage, right?
8324940	8330460	I didn't think about it as being on heartland town really until like the tour was like a third of the way through
8330700	8332060	I was like, oh
8332060	8334060	Oh, I made this
8334460	8337100	This is something I do and I
8338300	8342460	Never really hit me until that part. So I was like geez pretty pretty cool, right?
8343100	8344620	and uh
8344620	8349900	And then I just kept rolling with it and then afterwards it was just great to learn something at that point
8350380	8354380	I don't know man. I don't feel like it affected me as much as it should and for that, I
8355180	8357180	do
8361100	8363100	Right
8377940	8379940	It's amazing
8384380	8386380	Oh
