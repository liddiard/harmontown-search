72000	74000	Oh shit!
74000	78000	Oh my ass!
79000	82000	Alright, well, obviously somebody's being a little sarcastic about it.
82000	84000	No, no.
84000	88000	I'm very excited to be here tonight, Dan. Daniel.
88000	98000	I don't know if I've mentioned this to you in the past 25 years, but your sincerity sounds sarcastic.
98000	100000	That's my Midwest accent.
100000	104000	Let's bring Game Master Spencer Crittenden out.
104000	106000	Game Master!
106000	110000	Oh shit!
116000	118000	Oh shit!
118000	120000	Oh shit!
120000	122000	Oh shit!
122000	124000	Shit!
124000	126000	Shit!
126000	128000	Fucking shit!
128000	130000	Alright.
130000	132000	Alright.
132000	134000	It was great.
134000	136000	Thank you.
136000	138000	It was pretty good.
138000	140000	It was great weather tonight.
140000	142000	It was freezing.
142000	146000	I was walking home from the bar tonight and it was freezing.
146000	148000	It was freezing outside.
148000	150000	It was cold out.
150000	152000	It was so nice.
152000	154000	I went into the froyo.
154000	156000	You went into the froyo?
156000	158000	The froyo.
158000	160000	You went into the froyo?
160000	162000	It's warmer in the froyo.
162000	164000	That's how cold it is.
164000	170000	I gotta get out of this arctic chill. I better go to the frozen yogurt area.
170000	174000	No, because the froyo was not packed. It was deserted.
174000	176000	That's how cold it was.
176000	178000	It was what?
178000	180000	It was deserted.
180000	182000	Look at this guy.
182000	184000	Oh shit!
184000	192000	We're like the lions in front of the Chicago Museum of Natural History.
192000	194000	Oh shit!
194000	196000	That's what they're saying, right?
196000	198000	You want a book?
198000	200000	Shit!
200000	202000	Oh shit!
202000	206000	So, Halloween's upon us. You must be excited. You're one of those people.
206000	210000	I'm one of those people that is excited. What does that mean?
210000	212000	Well, you like to put effort into the Halloween.
212000	214000	I like putting effort into the Halloween.
214000	216000	You make the costumes.
216000	228000	You're like one of those Adam Savage art school dyslexic people.
228000	230000	This is true.
230000	234000	It's a big day of the year for you.
234000	238000	You like to go look at me. I'm a big robot.
238000	242000	Dan, what are you going to go for Halloween? Are you going to dress up this year?
242000	248000	I am proud to say that's a decision I have never made until three hours before any party I go to on Halloween.
248000	252000	And I have always done it with items in and around my neighborhood.
252000	256000	What is your favorite Halloween costume that you've ever done?
256000	258000	Stitch knowing me.
258000	262000	Well, I'm not counting the ones that you made for me. You made me a ghostbuster.
262000	264000	Yes, I did.
264000	268000	I was a ghostbuster. That was my best Halloween costume that I ever had.
268000	270000	I didn't make that costume.
270000	272000	That's true. I made it.
272000	275000	You made me a proton pack out of household objects. It looked like a proton pack.
275000	277000	It looked like one. It was great.
277000	279000	Great.
279000	281000	So here's the thing.
281000	283000	That was the best one.
283000	288000	Yeah, it was. My favorite one is when I found that computer monitor on the street.
288000	290000	The day of Halloween.
290000	292000	I took it home. I took all the stuff out.
292000	294000	I put the monitor on my head.
294000	296000	I glued Viking horns to it for my helmet.
296000	298000	I put on a fur diaper and a tail.
298000	300000	And I was a monitor.
305000	307000	And it was comfortable.
307000	309000	I could sit.
309000	311000	And all the fratty guys.
311000	313000	Because I was going out.
313000	316000	That was the only thing in my life.
316000	317000	You looked awesome.
317000	319000	Fratty guys liked me.
319000	321000	That was a costume contest.
321000	325000	Because I had a Belushi-ish kind of hairy appeal.
325000	327000	Let me just explain.
327000	330000	You only had the furry diaper and monitor.
330000	332000	You were shirtless.
332000	334000	Yeah.
334000	338000	I had a little fur cape because of my shoulder acne.
338000	340000	I remember that, yes.
340000	342000	Okay.
342000	344000	That was a good one.
344000	346000	So Dino and I were just talking about this.
346000	350000	So you know those people when they meet you?
350000	355000	And some of you are listening that are these people.
355000	358000	I've never been so certain about something.
358000	360000	I'm not a guy who proclaims things.
360000	361000	You know me.
361000	363000	This show is about me being old and going,
363000	365000	I don't know what to make of this.
365000	366000	What do you kids think?
366000	368000	And you're like, you're racist.
368000	370000	And I go, you're right.
370000	372000	Dad's racist.
372000	373000	What is race?
373000	375000	And they're like, you're right.
375000	376000	I'm talking about it so much.
376000	377000	I'm like, I talk about it too much.
377000	379000	You kids are right.
379000	382000	But here's something I'm absolutely certain of.
382000	383000	That I don't care.
383000	385000	I don't care if I'm the one person on earth saying this.
385000	389000	If you're one of those people who when you meet somebody,
389000	392000	if you ever hear yourself saying the words,
392000	395000	you don't remember my name, do you?
395000	397000	Oh, yeah.
397000	401000	I'm not going to say you're a terrible piece of shit.
401000	403000	Because you might be doing it because you learned,
403000	405000	you know how dogs learn to lift their leg from other dogs?
405000	409000	Some dogs spend their whole life going like that, like Harvey.
409000	411000	And then Nigel's just like, fuck it.
411000	413000	And then after a while, I guess they actually learn.
413000	414000	That's not important.
414000	417000	But you might have learned that behavior.
417000	419000	You might have learned that by being rewarded for it.
419000	421000	That's why I'm telling you.
421000	426000	If you're doing that, you are doing a bad thing to another person.
426000	427000	Why is it bad?
427000	430000	I know why it's bad, but I want education to happen.
430000	433000	Okay, so let's break it down.
433000	435000	Okay, do you want to VR this?
435000	436000	Should we VR it?
436000	438000	Wait, VR it?
438000	440000	What, very...
440000	442000	Virtual reality.
446000	448000	Veronica Robbins.
448000	449000	What did you think?
449000	450000	Why would VR?
450000	452000	We are VR. It's a show.
452000	453000	Okay, great.
453000	455000	Okay, we're at a party.
455000	456000	Oh, okay.
456000	458000	That's role-playing.
460000	461000	Whoo!
463000	464000	Tomato, tomato.
464000	465000	Alright, okay, here we go.
465000	467000	Okay, alright, I'm at a party.
467000	471000	Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
472000	473000	Mmm.
473000	474000	Hello?
474000	475000	That's great.
476000	478000	Oh, hey, hey!
478000	480000	Hey!
480000	481000	Hey.
481000	483000	Hi, Dan.
484000	486000	How's it going?
486000	488000	It's going pretty good.
491000	493000	You don't remember me, do you?
493000	495000	This party's amazing.
495000	499000	Kevin, who invited me to the party, and whose name I know,
499000	501000	did a great job hanging all these streamers.
501000	503000	I work with him.
503000	506000	He's my special effects engineer.
506000	509000	I had conversations with him about his children.
509000	510000	Kevin.
510000	512000	His party.
512000	513000	Dan.
513000	514000	No.
517000	518000	Freeze it!
518000	519000	What happened?
519000	520000	Let's...
520000	522000	Hitchhiker's Guide...
522000	525000	What happened?
525000	527000	What happened there?
527000	528000	I know what happened.
528000	530000	You know what happened.
530000	532000	They need to know what happened.
532000	533000	What happened is that my...
533000	535000	Well, okay, so here's the thing.
535000	537000	It's a bait and switch!
539000	540000	What?
540000	541000	It's a...
543000	546000	Because it always starts with this face.
546000	547000	Yeah.
547000	548000	Why is that a bait and switch?
548000	549000	It seems like a bait and bait.
549000	550000	Well, I don't know.
550000	551000	Maybe I'm using bait and switch wrong.
551000	552000	But it's...
552000	555000	Entrapment is what it is.
555000	556000	But is it even that?
556000	558000	It's just somebody coming up in there.
558000	560000	It's like if a cop just came up and said,
560000	562000	you're doing drugs, you're doing drugs, you're doing drugs,
562000	563000	you're doing drugs.
563000	564000	It's not entrapment.
564000	566000	I think it's somebody who comes up to knows that you're not
566000	568000	going to remember their name and goes,
568000	569000	hello, Dan.
569000	572000	Makes it a point to say your name.
572000	573000	Right?
573000	574000	Well, let's get...
574000	576000	I'm going to go one orbit beyond that.
576000	579000	What I want to say is like, let's really break this down.
579000	582000	So let's say someone doesn't remember your name.
582000	586000	So how is that on them?
586000	589000	If you're a human being and you acknowledge that
589000	593000	memory of your name is somehow currency,
593000	596000	then aren't you the poor one?
596000	597000	Yeah.
597000	598000	It's your fault.
598000	600000	You didn't make an impression.
600000	601000	Right.
601000	602000	And it's not like...
602000	603000	That would be the way...
603000	604000	That's the way to flip it
604000	606000	because those people push your shame button and you go,
606000	608000	oh, I should remember your name.
608000	610000	So then you want to flip it 180 degrees ago.
610000	612000	No, you're a piece of shit and you're unmemorable.
612000	616000	But like somewhere in the middle there is just fucking reality.
616000	617000	Yeah.
617000	618000	Like who cares?
618000	619000	I don't...
619000	620000	Maybe I have a fucking illness.
620000	621000	Maybe I...
621000	625000	Maybe you meet more people than the person who's complaining.
625000	627000	Maybe you look like my uncle.
627000	632000	Maybe my eye has a fucking like baby's finger in it.
632000	633000	Yeah.
633000	635000	Like maybe I'm in a Japanese horror movie
635000	637000	where I got baby fingers in my eye.
637000	638000	Baby fingers in the eye.
638000	641000	Maybe an asteroid passed through the fucking Earth's orbit
641000	644000	and like made a gas that only I'm allergic to
644000	647000	and that only I can sense that I can't sense it.
647000	648000	It doesn't matter.
648000	650000	Why does that matter?
650000	651000	It doesn't matter.
651000	653000	When people drop their wallet on the floor,
653000	658000	which is as much like an accident as them not knowing your name,
658000	660000	nobody ever goes like...
661000	663000	Blah blah blah blah.
669000	670000	Everyone just...
670000	672000	Everyone gets all excited and goes like,
672000	673000	oh hey, hey, hey, can I help you?
673000	674000	I'm Tarzan now.
674000	676000	Let me save the jungle.
676000	677000	Save that jungle, man.
677000	679000	Someone save it from the great white hunter
679000	681000	of you having dropped your wallet.
681000	682000	Aren't you thankful you met me?
682000	684000	You're all stoked when someone drops their wallet.
684000	686000	When they forget your name you're like,
686000	689000	ow, someone pooped their pants.
689000	691000	But you know that you don't really think that.
691000	693000	You know what you're thinking is,
693000	697000	uh oh, I pooped the pants of memorability.
697000	699000	And it's like, and here's the thing.
699000	702000	So this is why I've turned around on tattoos
702000	703000	and piercings and all that stuff.
703000	704000	Not because I'm not saying like,
704000	706000	oh thank you and you're doing that for me
706000	707000	so I remember who you are.
707000	709000	Your steel face or like, you know,
709000	711000	spider neck or whatever.
711000	713000	But these are people who, okay,
713000	715000	so I used to think, I was like,
715000	717000	oh man, I don't trust you if you have tattoos.
717000	718000	This is me 20 years ago.
718000	720000	Everybody in the audience has fucking tattoos now.
720000	721000	And I love you all.
721000	725000	But when it first started becoming a thing
725000	727000	and I was always like, man,
727000	730000	somebody's got a tattoo or a thing through their face.
730000	734000	All I see is somebody that's thinking like,
734000	736000	oh, I don't know who I am.
736000	737000	They don't know who I am.
737000	739000	And I'm like, I'm gonna move to California.
739000	740000	That's who I am.
740000	741000	I'm gonna make everybody know who I am.
741000	744000	Everybody will know who I am when I move to California.
744000	746000	But now in this apocalypse,
746000	748000	you're being sarcastic the whole night.
750000	751000	No, no.
751000	753000	This is like, Ed McMahon did this to Johnny.
753000	754000	No, no, no, no, no.
754000	755000	He said, you never knew.
755000	756000	He could never nail him down.
756000	758000	It was just always over there going,
758000	761000	oh, yeah, what a great job.
761000	763000	Everybody, I'm supportive.
763000	765000	And Johnny would go home and he'd go,
765000	767000	I know that fucking asshole is fucking,
767000	768000	I'm gonna catch him.
768000	769000	I'm gonna catch him.
769000	771000	I'm on your side.
771000	772000	I'm on your side.
772000	773000	So at least if you,
773000	775000	we all wake up with that feeling,
775000	777000	oh boy, I hope people remember me.
777000	780000	Oh, I just ran into the sixth person this week
780000	782000	who it became clear, like,
782000	784000	they had me confused with someone else.
784000	786000	Like, I now, like,
786000	789000	the person who takes that onto themself,
789000	792000	I'm not saying it makes them a better or worse person,
792000	793000	but like, at least they're,
793000	794000	well, I am saying it makes them a better person
794000	796000	because they're attending their own garden.
796000	798000	Like, I'm not saying they should do what they do.
798000	799000	And people are gonna be offended
799000	800000	because they're gonna go, I have a tattoo
800000	802000	and guess what, it's an expression of this.
802000	804000	You're saying that it's because I'm an incomplete person.
804000	805000	I'm not saying that.
805000	806000	I'm just saying, like,
806000	809000	now when I see somebody who has something weird about them,
809000	812000	like a funny hat at an angle
812000	815000	or like a bird on their shoulder.
815000	816000	Yeah.
816000	819000	Like one boot's big and the other one's like really small.
819000	820000	The small boot.
820000	824000	Or your name is like Trisha,
824000	825000	but it's spelled with nine I's.
825000	826000	Yeah.
826000	828000	And one of them's an E,
828000	831000	but it's called an I.
831000	833000	Now I'm like,
833000	837000	no, this is a person who is like kind of saying like,
837000	838000	I'm meaning you halfway.
838000	839000	They're saying like,
839000	843000	I'm making this my problem, not yours.
843000	844000	I don't know if it's true.
844000	845000	I don't know if it's not true,
845000	848000	but I'm doing something about it by myself.
848000	850000	I'm going down to the corner.
850000	852000	I'm gonna say stick a needle in my face
852000	853000	and draw a scorpion on it
853000	855000	and like fucking like take some shit,
855000	857000	put it up my butt and give me a tail.
857000	859000	You're asking people to do that too?
859000	860000	No.
860000	862000	You just said I'm, okay.
862000	863000	Okay.
863000	866000	I lost you with the needle in the butt,
866000	871000	but I also started paying attention.
871000	872000	But the people who go like,
872000	873000	you don't know my name, do you?
873000	875000	So just don't do that because you might have,
875000	876000	don't do it.
876000	877000	It's like a social thing where you're like,
877000	878000	oh, I have leverage now.
878000	879000	You don't have leverage.
879000	880000	They're gonna,
880000	883000	everyone that you hope that would affect in your favor,
883000	887000	like that's exactly the person that's gonna bum out the most.
887000	889000	Like the thing that is like,
889000	892000	always, just always, I always do this.
892000	893000	Like, I just go like,
893000	895000	just be the person that says,
895000	900000	if there's even 10% of a reason to be unsure,
900000	903000	just say, oh, Matt Dawson,
903000	906000	just in case you don't remember or something.
906000	907000	That's what I do.
907000	910000	I always say, hey, Rob Schwab.
910000	911000	Rob Schwab, I don't know if you remember.
911000	913000	Even I don't know if you remember,
913000	914000	it kind of like sets them up.
914000	915000	But we'll figure it out.
915000	919000	But I do it from a point of,
919000	921000	I don't expect you to remember.
921000	923000	Maybe because you probably have a busy day.
923000	924000	You have children.
924000	926000	You have a car.
926000	930000	You have shows that you watch with other names of characters
930000	931000	and stuff like that.
931000	932000	That's a lot to process.
932000	935000	So I'm saying, hey, hey, how you doing, Rob Schwab?
935000	936000	Oh, you remembered me.
936000	938000	Oh, bonus for me that you remembered me.
938000	941000	Oh.
941000	944000	So make that noise more often.
944000	945000	So here's the funny thing.
945000	947000	This Halloween, now watch for this.
947000	948000	So this is why I brought this all up.
948000	950000	Because Dino and I were talking about this.
950000	951000	We were talking about that topic.
951000	953000	And then we started talking about Halloween costumes.
953000	956000	And we started talking about the people who do the puns.
956000	959000	And the one that I really remember very clearly
959000	961000	was somebody in Milwaukee that was like,
961000	964000	he was pitching somebody their Halloween costume in front of me.
964000	966000	And I was just sitting there at the bar.
966000	968000	And he's like, this is what I'm going to do.
968000	971000	Paint myself blue, head to toe,
972000	975000	and look with a frame, like an empty frame.
975000	976000	I'm going to carry it around.
976000	980000	And I'm making you guess.
980000	981000	Gay or New England?
981000	985000	I just noticed.
985000	987000	Because I'm trying to do an actual impression of this guy.
987000	990000	And I'm like, wait, is he gay or is he from New England?
990000	993000	I was like, I'm going to have a painting frame.
993000	997000	And then tampons on strings just all around.
997000	998000	And then he waits.
998000	1000000	He waits for the five second pause, which is what people do.
1000000	1003000	And they just, when they pitch you their fucking pun Halloween costumes.
1003000	1008000	And then he goes, Picasso's blue period.
1008000	1011000	Yeah, because what, and where in the world,
1011000	1014000	what dimension is anyone going to go like, ah!
1014000	1016000	Oh!
1016000	1023000	God, I knew the words blue and period would be involved.
1023000	1028000	Because you painted yourself blue.
1029000	1033000	And then tampons are for periods.
1033000	1036000	Did that person ever follow through and make that costume?
1036000	1040000	I bet he didn't because he talked it out.
1040000	1043000	You don't see Woody Allen being like, what if I did a drama?
1043000	1046000	He's like, tippity tap, tap, tap.
1046000	1048000	He doesn't give a shit if the movie's good or bad.
1048000	1049000	I was like, now he's got 90 movies.
1049000	1051000	So of course he has five great ones.
1051000	1053000	Obviously I have access to grind hair.
1053000	1056000	Ooh, here we go.
1056000	1062000	Shots fired.
1062000	1065000	So okay, so just give me a second.
1065000	1067000	Just let me say so for a second.
1067000	1069000	Just give me a second.
1069000	1070000	Oh, just give me a second.
1070000	1073000	So this Halloween, so here's the thing.
1073000	1076000	So you're going to be walking around and there's going to be,
1076000	1081000	of course, there's the usual amount of now aging kitty cats.
1081000	1084000	I think that's like a baby boomer thing right now.
1084000	1085000	Kitty cats.
1085000	1086000	A sexy kitty cat.
1086000	1087000	Oh, okay.
1087000	1088000	Right.
1088000	1091000	And then there's the kind of like, there's that whole thing.
1091000	1095000	And then there's like the, but then there's going to be a lot of puns.
1095000	1096000	A lot of pun people.
1096000	1098000	So pay attention to this.
1098000	1100000	These pun people, these pun costume people.
1100000	1103000	Because Dina was telling this story about how a guy came up
1103000	1107000	and he was wearing blue from the neck down
1107000	1111000	and then he had like a white cotton thing on top.
1111000	1114000	And this is the thing that happens at Halloween parties.
1114000	1117000	And he goes like, what do you think?
1117000	1124000	And Dina's like, oh, very scary.
1124000	1127000	And the guy goes, I'm a Q-tip.
1127000	1130000	And Dina's like, why aren't your shoes furry?
1130000	1132000	And why am I having this conversation?
1132000	1135000	And why is this not riddle day?
1135000	1138000	And if it was, you're cheating like Bilbo Baggins saying,
1138000	1139000	what's in my pocket?
1139000	1143000	Like you're not doing a good, your fantasy is to be a Q-tip
1143000	1145000	and to have people go, ah, it's Q-tip.
1145000	1147000	Or is it?
1147000	1151000	And underneath that Q-tip costume, isn't there a guy
1151000	1154000	who on Monday morning at the water cooler is going to be saying,
1154000	1156000	you don't know my name, do you?
1156000	1157000	No.
1157000	1160000	It's the same fucking guy.
1160000	1162000	You just watch them.
1162000	1164000	And they're reptile people.
1164000	1166000	They go on Halloween and they go like,
1166000	1168000	they purposely make this shitty pun costume
1168000	1172000	and then they walk around and go, because they can't take one day off.
1173000	1176000	Of being, of everyone else's fault,
1176000	1180000	of it being everyone else's fault that they're not memorable.
1180000	1182000	That would be, Halloween should be their fucking like,
1182000	1184000	that should be their Achilles heel, baby.
1184000	1186000	Because they get to be whoever they want.
1186000	1189000	And it's their fault if you don't know them.
1189000	1191000	Because if they were, if their friend Flintstone it,
1191000	1193000	you don't know it's their fault.
1193000	1195000	And I'm telling you, it's just as much their fault
1195000	1200000	that you don't know their Bob Johnson 364 days a year.
1200000	1203000	So they fucking chick it out.
1203000	1205000	And they go like, they make the,
1205000	1207000	they make the Fred Flintstone shirt like kind of purple.
1207000	1210000	And they put the tire on their shoulder so that they're like,
1210000	1214000	I'm Fred Flintstone after the OJ trials or something.
1214000	1217000	And it's like, you always think like,
1217000	1219000	oh, the joke didn't land.
1219000	1221000	No, reptile person.
1221000	1224000	Like, can't fuck a cold-blooded animal.
1224000	1225000	Can't fucking do it.
1225000	1229000	If you have to go guess what I am, you did it wrong.
1230000	1234000	Hey, yeah, you know, if you got to go ask me what I'm,
1234000	1237000	what I am, you did it wrong.
1237000	1239000	Oh, not in front of all of me.
1239000	1245000	If your, if your, if your idea of a seven course meal
1245000	1248000	is a six pack and a hot dog,
1248000	1251000	you might have a Halloween costume.
1257000	1259000	Here comes the phone.
1261000	1263000	Hello, driver's license.
1266000	1269000	Yeah. And I don't know if you people are familiar with this problem,
1269000	1273000	but I haven't done my left hand on my phone yet.
1273000	1274000	Oh man.
1274000	1276000	So I have to, it's just, it's a nightmare.
1276000	1277000	You got to bite that bully.
1277000	1278000	I haven't scanned my left thumb yet.
1278000	1280000	You got to scan it, man.
1280000	1281000	I know.
1284000	1285000	It takes like two minutes.
1285000	1286000	It's the worst.
1287000	1290000	My hands are too sweaty for those things.
1290000	1291000	They don't read it.
1291000	1294000	I swear, if these people knew how we really lived,
1294000	1297000	it must be nice for them.
1297000	1302000	My, my thumbs are greasy from all those chips that I eat.
1304000	1305000	I eat a lot of chips.
1305000	1307000	All right. I don't have anything else.
1307000	1309000	Chips are delicious.
1309000	1312000	I had some chips before I came here.
1313000	1314000	All right. Hey.
1314000	1317000	So I, I think, I think we'll do things in hashtag.
1325000	1327000	Why would you hashtag chips?
1328000	1329000	Oh, you have a gift.
1329000	1330000	Okay.
1330000	1331000	Did you, is this a plant?
1331000	1332000	What happened?
1332000	1333000	What's going on?
1333000	1334000	Does this happen every show?
1334000	1335000	I should know about this stuff.
1335000	1337000	I'm controlling.
1340000	1341000	Oh no.
1341000	1343000	You should stick it up your butt.
1343000	1345000	You should definitely stick it up your butt.
1345000	1348000	If you're, if you don't, you're using it wrong.
1352000	1354000	It's got to be thick then.
1360000	1361000	All right. Well, yeah.
1361000	1363000	I mean, it would be weird to not bring you up now.
1368000	1370000	This is the hottest hot sauce in the world.
1371000	1374000	What, who's, what place is coming out of this chair?
1374000	1376000	If you can, excuse me here.
1376000	1379000	I've got the hottest hot sauce in the world with some toothpicks.
1380000	1385000	This is encouraging behavior that is going to snowball for the
1385000	1386000	rest of the show.
1386000	1387000	Yeah. We're not careful.
1387000	1390000	This is poisonous poison in the world.
1390000	1394000	No, honestly, like beef jerky.
1395000	1398000	This honestly shows how easy it would be to poison people.
1398000	1399000	Yeah.
1400000	1401000	Yeah. Look at it.
1401000	1403000	It looks like blood.
1403000	1404000	What's your name? Young man.
1404000	1405000	My name is Garrett Harvey.
1405000	1407000	And are you 12 years old?
1409000	1410000	You know, I wish.
1410000	1414000	The important thing is he, when I asked him his name,
1414000	1417000	he didn't say Garrett, Garrett, Jason Harvey or Garrett,
1417000	1418000	Lee Harvey.
1418000	1420000	He's, he's only got two names.
1420000	1421000	So this should be safe.
1421000	1424000	Well, that was that, that, that,
1424000	1427000	that age joke was a dis on us, not you.
1427000	1428000	You know that, right?
1428000	1429000	No, no, it's fine.
1429000	1430000	No.
1430000	1432000	So he's probably, he's probably, he's probably so young.
1432000	1433000	He probably, he probably goes home and goes,
1433000	1435000	someone called me 11 again.
1436000	1437000	And he fucking gold bloomed.
1437000	1439000	This is like 11.
1439000	1440000	This is like 11.
1442000	1444000	So pretty much.
1447000	1450000	And the two picks are what for there for eating the hot sauce,
1450000	1452000	which I wouldn't recommend anybody.
1452000	1456000	Who just eats fucking hot sauce on a toothpick?
1456000	1457000	What?
1457000	1461000	What it is, is you put that shit on some chips.
1462000	1464000	Gotta get the chips out.
1464000	1466000	Where are the chips?
1467000	1469000	Get some chips on here.
1469000	1471000	Get some chips.
1471000	1474000	You put the hot sauce on a toothpick.
1474000	1475000	No, no, no.
1475000	1478000	Why the fuck are putting the hot sauce on a toothpick?
1479000	1480000	He's got some chips.
1480000	1481000	Somebody's got chips.
1481000	1482000	I think you should try it.
1482000	1485000	I mean, his reaction would actually be pretty fucking.
1485000	1487000	The thing that's confusing to me about this,
1487000	1489000	and I don't want to be like a negative Nelly or slower thing,
1489000	1491000	but it's just, it just seems like, well, of course,
1491000	1493000	I mean, it's like, you could bring battery acid up here.
1493000	1495000	And I was like, oh, that's very hot.
1495000	1496000	And I'll be like, oh, that hurts.
1496000	1499000	Like I'm not like an adrenaline junkie or a pain.
1499000	1501000	Like, I don't, like what?
1501000	1503000	That's not going to get me drunk or.
1503000	1505000	If you have enough of it, maybe.
1505000	1507000	But it doesn't, I mean, it's not, it's not,
1507000	1509000	it's not like jackass or anything like.
1509000	1510000	No, no, no.
1510000	1512000	But it might make the show.
1512000	1513000	It might make the show.
1514000	1516000	Well, I mean, insult taken, but.
1522000	1525000	I hope to God we don't get to that point.
1525000	1529000	But if there's chips, they got chips.
1529000	1531000	They got chips.
1531000	1534000	OK, we got some chips.
1534000	1535000	Dan, we got chips.
1535000	1536000	I'll have some.
1536000	1537000	Dan will have some.
1537000	1538000	I don't know.
1538000	1539000	Well, why don't you?
1539000	1540000	Why doesn't he do it?
1540000	1541000	We can't show the label.
1541000	1543000	I'll do it with all of you.
1543000	1544000	You're going to do it too.
1544000	1548000	Just he do it in case, you know, we have to do a show after this.
1551000	1553000	Now these are potato chips.
1553000	1556000	They're not standard regulation chips.
1556000	1559000	Like the possibility that this is great.
1559000	1562000	Let's say it's one in four.
1562000	1566000	But out of a thousand, the possibility of it going wrong.
1566000	1570000	The consequences of that are much, much more dire than I think.
1570000	1571000	Any possible.
1571000	1573000	I would say air on too much.
1573000	1574000	Yeah.
1574000	1575000	No, it just hurts.
1575000	1576000	And there's no milk.
1576000	1580000	So you'll drink water or something and then it'll hurt more and it'll get worse.
1580000	1581000	Yeah.
1581000	1582000	Right.
1582000	1583000	I'm eyes wide open.
1583000	1584000	Same as you.
1584000	1585000	But it's weird to.
1585000	1586000	It's weird to just say no.
1586000	1587000	Hey, man.
1587000	1590000	It's I'm too trained for the theater.
1590000	1591000	I'm not going to do it.
1591000	1592000	I already said yes.
1592000	1593000	We get the chips.
1593000	1595000	I'm too shape of the show, man.
1595000	1596000	This is why.
1597000	1598000	Chips right there in the cup.
1598000	1599000	Come on.
1600000	1602000	Yeah, just make it a lot.
1602000	1606000	And incidentally, this is so you want to do the chips and not the toothpick because
1606000	1611000	I'm offering you to just dip the tip of the toothpick and see if he's offering you
1611000	1612000	an easy way.
1612000	1613000	All right.
1613000	1614000	Okay.
1614000	1615000	How do you eat it?
1615000	1616000	I just did it.
1616000	1617000	Okay.
1617000	1618000	Well, for fun.
1618000	1619000	Doesn't make any sense.
1619000	1620000	You're an insane person.
1620000	1621000	But why are you?
1621000	1622000	Why are you?
1622000	1623000	Are you?
1623000	1624000	You're like a conehead.
1624000	1625000	You're like Mark from Ork.
1625000	1626000	Are you?
1626000	1627000	Are you putting on some shit?
1627000	1628000	Okay.
1629000	1631000	Why do you put hot sauce on a toothpick?
1631000	1633000	It's not it's not food, Rob.
1633000	1636000	It's not even a kind of he's going to hurt us really bad to the point where he doesn't
1636000	1638000	even eat it on a chip.
1638000	1639000	I'll do it.
1639000	1640000	You'll eat it on a chip.
1640000	1641000	Okay.
1641000	1642000	Okay.
1642000	1643000	But we got to do it all at the same time.
1643000	1644000	This is the worst.
1644000	1647000	I hope you're proud of yourself, young man.
1648000	1652000	I mean, I do this specifically because my sister listens to the podcast and she told
1652000	1654000	me not to embarrass her.
1654000	1655000	Yeah.
1657000	1658000	I look like.
1658000	1661000	Now who makes the hottest hot sauce ever?
1661000	1662000	It's called Satan's blood.
1662000	1663000	So probably Satan.
1664000	1666000	Ask a stupid question.
1669000	1671000	It's called Satan's blood.
1671000	1672000	What do you do?
1672000	1675000	You just hang out and you just dip toothpicks in Satan's blood.
1677000	1678000	I mean, don't pour it on.
1678000	1680000	Wipe the toothpick on it.
1680000	1682000	I mean, you the joke is up.
1682000	1685000	You're just like, you might as well come up here with a stapler and go put this
1685000	1686000	through your nuts.
1686000	1687000	And we're like, why would I do that?
1688000	1689000	And then it's like, okay, here we go.
1690000	1691000	You're freaking him out.
1692000	1693000	I don't want that.
1694000	1696000	Give that chip dispenser.
1696000	1698000	I'm not touching none of that.
1698000	1699000	All right.
1699000	1704000	So I mean, you know, wait, I just don't know how it'll work on the chip.
1704000	1705000	So what are you a foodie now?
1705000	1706000	I don't know.
1706000	1712000	You should really have white wine and fish with this.
1714000	1715000	It's just acid.
1715000	1717000	It's just a hurtful acid shake.
1717000	1720000	This is some because he's like, gee, I hope I'm not.
1720000	1722000	What if I kill both of them?
1722000	1723000	I hope I didn't.
1723000	1726000	Yeah, we're going to like shit our pants and die.
1730000	1735000	And it's just so again, I mean, I wouldn't recommend this at all.
1736000	1737000	Like it's not a joke.
1737000	1738000	You're right.
1738000	1739000	We shouldn't do it right now.
1739000	1741000	No, we just didn't do it.
1741000	1742000	Just think about all this.
1742000	1745000	Just think about the hottest hot sauce you've ever had.
1745000	1749000	This is a lot hotter than any of well, it could.
1749000	1753000	Any number of terrible things may happen, but all that could happen.
1753000	1757000	And that's good is maybe it'll be kind of entertaining for five minutes or so.
1758000	1761000	I just don't think I totally agree with you.
1761000	1764000	I absolutely 100% agree with you, but there's no choice.
1765000	1767000	Can you go going up to them?
1767000	1769000	You're saying no.
1769000	1772000	I'd be a hero if I didn't do it.
1772000	1773000	All right.
1773000	1774000	Go ahead.
1774000	1775000	They're saying no.
1775000	1776000	They're saying no.
1776000	1778000	No, they would be disappointed in me.
1778000	1779000	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
1779000	1781000	So just walk me through this.
1781000	1790000	Like it's a Friday afternoon and you're like, hey, man, let's skip class and stick toothpicks
1791000	1795000	in Satan's blood and just have a good time, man.
1795000	1797000	I honestly, it's for a laugh factor.
1797000	1800000	So you just give it to people who've never had it before.
1800000	1802000	Just be like, hey, this is what you expect from the group.
1802000	1803000	All right.
1803000	1804000	We're going to fuck with you.
1804000	1805000	All right.
1805000	1806000	Let's all have a hand for...
1806000	1807000	I'm not doing it.
1807000	1808000	I'm not doing it.
1808000	1810000	It's like a hand buzzer in your mouth.
1810000	1811000	I'm not going to...
1811000	1812000	It's not even temporary.
1812000	1814000	Spencer said your tongue could swell up.
1814000	1816000	They said don't do it.
1816000	1817000	Okay, I'm going to hold on to it.
1817000	1819000	If the show starts dying, I'm going to eat it.
1819000	1820000	Okay.
1820000	1821000	Yeah.
1821000	1822000	Mine's right here.
1822000	1823000	Okay.
1823000	1825000	If it comes down to that, then we'll do it.
1825000	1826000	Sounds good.
1826000	1827000	The rest of this is for you.
1827000	1828000	Okay.
1828000	1829000	Thank you.
1829000	1830000	Terrific.
1830000	1831000	Nah.
1831000	1832000	We...
1832000	1833000	Fuck off, Lee.
1833000	1834000	We'll do that.
1834000	1835000	We got a lot of guests tonight.
1835000	1836000	That's the thing.
1836000	1839000	Some of our aneurysm survivors, not to make you feel too guilty.
1839000	1840000	But...
1840000	1842000	Kind of a let down.
1842000	1844000	Do with that information what you will.
1844000	1845000	Well, Shrob could do it.
1845000	1846000	That's fine if Shrob doesn't.
1846000	1847000	I'm going to wait.
1848000	1850000	You're saying it was a let down that I didn't eat the chip,
1850000	1852000	or that it was a let down that he...
1852000	1853000	I'm so happy.
1853000	1856000	That his food turned out to be a practical joke.
1856000	1857000	What do you think?
1857000	1858000	Yes.
1858000	1859000	What...
1859000	1860000	All right.
1860000	1861000	We got to move on.
1861000	1863000	Can we move the fuck on with the fucking show?
1863000	1865000	Shrob.
1865000	1869000	Because I got a lot of shit to do tonight.
1869000	1871000	A lot of shit.
1871000	1872000	All right?
1872000	1875000	Hey, when you yell at me.
1875000	1876000	I've had it with you.
1876000	1877000	I know.
1877000	1879000	Let's bring out both...
1879000	1880000	Wait, wait.
1880000	1881000	Hold on.
1881000	1882000	I've got to figure out what order to do this in.
1882000	1883000	Because we've got to check...
1883000	1885000	Do it in the right order.
1885000	1887000	Well, I'm trying to figure out what that is.
1887000	1889000	That fucking hot sauce guy.
1889000	1891000	Now we have him to blame for the whole night.
1891000	1892000	That's what's nice about it.
1892000	1894000	I liked what happened.
1894000	1895000	You liked what happened?
1895000	1896000	Yeah, I know.
1896000	1897000	It's not a popular opinion.
1897000	1900000	It was sort of a defiance of the usual dynamics that I was struggling with.
1900000	1903000	I was like, well, this is like Evil Knievel goes up to the Grand Canyon
1903000	1904000	and then turns around.
1904000	1907000	How entertaining is it that he just goes over to the Grand Canyon?
1907000	1908000	And then he's like, oh, I broke my leg.
1908000	1910000	And it's like, what's wrong with our society?
1910000	1916000	Evil Knievel was a stuntman from 2,000 years ago
1916000	1920000	for anybody who doesn't know what Dan is talking about.
1920000	1925000	In case you thought he was an accountant.
1925000	1926000	I don't know.
1926000	1929000	Hey, he didn't name himself Evil Knievel because he thought,
1929000	1933000	oh, I only want to be famous in 1975.
1933000	1935000	He's like, they're going to remember this name.
1935000	1937000	Even if they don't, they're going to know what I do from it.
1937000	1938000	Right.
1938000	1939000	Evil Knievel.
1939000	1940000	Knievel.
1940000	1944000	I'm going to evil all the Knievel.
1944000	1951000	All right, let's bring out both at the same time
1951000	1954000	because they both belong to the same family.
1954000	1957000	Also, we talked to Felicia Day last week.
1957000	1959000	These are two good friends of hers.
1960000	1963000	They both have done stuff for Geek and Sundry
1963000	1968000	if you're a geek sundering around there.
1968000	1971000	But they're just two folks that I've always wanted to have a chat with.
1971000	1974000	Let's bring out In Order of Gender.
1980000	1981000	Ooh.
1990000	1992000	Don't fuck this up, Dan.
1992000	1994000	Don't fuck this up.
1994000	1996000	Oh, Jesus God.
1999000	2001000	The chip's like breaking glass.
2001000	2005000	He's just going to pop it in his mouth and start screaming.
2005000	2007000	It'll take it.
2007000	2008000	I'll do it for you, man.
2008000	2010000	I'll do it for you.
2010000	2013000	In Order of Gender Descending.
2013000	2015000	Oh, God.
2015000	2017000	What?
2017000	2018000	You don't know who I'm bringing up first.
2018000	2019000	How is that an oh?
2019000	2022000	Oh, because I'm pitting the genders against each other.
2022000	2023000	Yeah, you can't do that anymore.
2023000	2025000	In Order of Gender Randomly.
2031000	2035000	And also, while recognizing that either one of them at any given time,
2035000	2039000	we do not have the right to know what's going on in either of their pants
2039000	2040000	or their brains.
2040000	2041000	True.
2041000	2043000	And gender shouldn't be a thing.
2043000	2044000	Why?
2044000	2045000	Why?
2045000	2046000	Why?
2046000	2047000	I did it!
2047000	2049000	Legalize it!
2049000	2051000	Legalize it!
2051000	2053000	Legalize it!
2053000	2055000	Legalize it!
2055000	2056000	Legalize it!
2056000	2058000	Legalize it!
2058000	2060000	Legalize it!
2060000	2061000	Legalize it!
2061000	2062000	Legalize it!
2062000	2064000	Legalize lack of gender?
2064000	2065000	Yep.
2065000	2068000	This guy, when you tried to do the better, he was like, uh.
2068000	2070000	He went like that, and then I said, sorry.
2070000	2071000	And he went, oh, you're good.
2071000	2074000	And I was like, well, you're not then.
2074000	2075000	You're not good.
2075000	2076000	I don't want to.
2076000	2078000	Because I thought maybe he was like, I'm in pain.
2078000	2079000	Stop.
2079000	2080000	No.
2080000	2082000	But he's just like, no, I'm terrible at your stage dive.
2082000	2083000	I don't want to.
2083000	2088000	I don't want to do it.
2088000	2091000	I wouldn't know how to participate in a stage dive.
2091000	2097000	I've only done one, and I mean.
2097000	2098000	He's too far back, though.
2098000	2099000	That's the problem.
2099000	2100000	Too far back!
2100000	2101000	Is that Dave Klein?
2101000	2102000	Oh, Dave Klein's here.
2102000	2106000	I bet Dave Klein would have you.
2106000	2109000	For dinner.
2109000	2111000	He's Dracula.
2111000	2116000	Why don't you guys react if that was just a Dracula joke.
2116000	2117000	All right.
2117000	2118000	God damn it.
2118000	2119000	Let's bring out our fucking guests.
2119000	2120000	You're the host.
2120000	2121000	I can't help it.
2121000	2126000	I have no idea where the vaginas and penises are on either of them.
2126000	2128000	Say both at the same time.
2128000	2129000	One's a writer.
2129000	2130000	One's a dialogue.
2130000	2132000	I might offend one of them that way, too.
2132000	2133000	I don't.
2133000	2136000	They're just nerds doing what we do.
2136000	2138000	They're a part of our family.
2138000	2142000	Let's bring out randomly Amy Berg and Will Wheaton.
2142000	2151000	I hope you guys like chips.
2151000	2164000	I'm so glad you didn't eat that fuck out of us.
2164000	2165000	Oh, my God.
2165000	2166000	Oh, good.
2166000	2167000	Well, that's great.
2167000	2168000	Thank you.
2168000	2169000	Great.
2169000	2170000	We thought you were going to waste our night, man.
2170000	2171000	What's the worst you've ever seen?
2171000	2172000	You'd be fine.
2172000	2174000	You'd have to go to the bathroom.
2174000	2175000	Really?
2175000	2176000	Yeah, you'd be sobbing.
2176000	2178000	So they have stuff they make that's like...
2178000	2180000	That's what that is, literally.
2180000	2184000	You would be shooting blood for like four hours.
2184000	2185000	I just...
2185000	2186000	Okay.
2186000	2187000	I mean, I don't want the...
2187000	2190000	If you eat food that's based on a dare, just go have dim sum.
2190000	2193000	So they kept trying to say, you know, it's not that kind of show, kid.
2193000	2194000	Right.
2194000	2195000	And he's like, but my sister.
2195000	2197000	I'm like, your sister told you don't embarrass her.
2197000	2199000	And he's like, but she's my sister.
2199000	2202000	This is the telekinetic conversation we had.
2202000	2203000	Yeah.
2203000	2204000	Telekinetic.
2204000	2206000	We've moved each other's eyebrows.
2207000	2212000	So anyways, so last couple of weeks I've had authors on who have books that I've read before the thing.
2212000	2215000	And then I walked through the entire book and some people enjoy it and some people don't.
2215000	2217000	But I just wanted to like, we could just hang out, right?
2217000	2222000	Because I researched your guys' shit today and I'm excited because of that to talk to you guys.
2222000	2223000	But I'm hoping we can...
2223000	2224000	I want to just...
2224000	2228000	I want to hang out and talk nonsense, hopefully for most of the time.
2228000	2229000	Why did I say that?
2229000	2230000	What are you supposed to do?
2230000	2231000	No, I want to talk about...
2231000	2235000	I'd like to talk about the serious issues.
2235000	2236000	Or the book I...
2236000	2238000	I prefer sense.
2238000	2241000	But also the thing is, I don't know where to start because we have...
2241000	2244000	Because there's another friend I want to bring up here tonight.
2244000	2247000	I want to check in with him and I'm trying to figure out...
2247000	2249000	I'm not talking about my dick or anything.
2249000	2250000	Is that what you...
2250000	2251000	Oh.
2251000	2252000	Oh.
2252000	2253000	What were they laughing at?
2253000	2254000	My hair went up in the air?
2254000	2255000	Maybe.
2255000	2256000	They look good.
2256000	2259000	That's their deal breaker with my hair?
2259000	2260000	This is the first...
2260000	2263000	Do you know how Dan's hair looked like shit tonight?
2263000	2264000	It's like he doesn't know how to take care of it.
2264000	2265000	I just couldn't get into the show.
2265000	2267000	I couldn't get past that.
2267000	2273000	I come here from Burbank to see a guy whose hair looks good.
2273000	2274000	Yeah.
2274000	2276000	I wonder if this is somebody with bad hair.
2276000	2280000	I would have gone to the Hollywood Bowl tonight.
2280000	2282000	Ooh, Hollywood Bowl.
2282000	2284000	Van Halen.
2284000	2285000	Ooh.
2285000	2288000	These guys, I don't understand them ever.
2288000	2290000	Almost ever.
2290000	2291000	Ooh, the Hollywood Bowl.
2291000	2292000	But they were really helpful about the chip.
2293000	2295000	They were very protective and helpful with the hot sauce.
2295000	2296000	Yeah.
2296000	2297000	You guys were looking out.
2297000	2300000	But then you say something like Hollywood Bowl and they're like racist.
2300000	2301000	I know.
2301000	2302000	It's terrible.
2302000	2303000	Ooh.
2303000	2304000	Yeah.
2304000	2305000	I don't know.
2305000	2306000	I don't know.
2306000	2308000	I'm assuming with the best of intentions.
2308000	2309000	I think they're good kids.
2309000	2311000	I think they're going to make a great society.
2311000	2312000	Yeah.
2312000	2314000	You're welcome.
2314000	2320000	I'm sorry about the earth burning to a cinder when you're 38.
2320000	2321000	Good luck.
2322000	2325000	Seriously, millennials, learn how to swim.
2325000	2327000	It is a skill you're going to need.
2327000	2328000	Also, yeah.
2328000	2329000	And you know what?
2329000	2330000	Forget the apostrophe thing.
2330000	2332000	I've been on you for it for 20 years.
2332000	2334000	Just forget it at this point.
2334000	2335000	You're your...
2335000	2336000	Who cares?
2336000	2337000	We're going to die.
2339000	2341000	It doesn't matter anymore.
2341000	2343000	I'm not mad at you anymore.
2343000	2344000	Who cares?
2344000	2346000	Don't learn to spell.
2346000	2348000	It would be wasting your time at this point.
2348000	2350000	You'd be wasting your time.
2350000	2351000	Just keep...
2354000	2356000	So Amy Burke, I'm sorry.
2356000	2358000	It's like in no necessary order.
2358000	2360000	Here's the random things I want to talk to you guys about.
2360000	2363000	Amy is working on this show right now.
2363000	2364000	It's not on yet at all.
2364000	2367000	You said you were doing a 10-episode order,
2367000	2369000	and then they're going to air it later.
2369000	2371000	So I'm assuming this is like some new media thing,
2371000	2373000	like this isn't CBS.
2373000	2374000	No, it's Stars.
2374000	2375000	It's premium cable.
2375000	2376000	Stars, okay.
2376000	2377000	Premium cable.
2377000	2379000	Whoo!
2379000	2381000	Ooh la la!
2382000	2383000	Ow!
2384000	2386000	That means we can have sexy time.
2387000	2389000	And swearing, which is more important to me.
2390000	2392000	But they killed Party Down.
2393000	2394000	They're the worst ever.
2395000	2396000	Yay!
2396000	2397000	Also my favorite.
2397000	2398000	Racist!
2399000	2401000	What's Stars slogan?
2405000	2406000	What's Stars?
2406000	2407000	Where the...
2409000	2410000	Watch...
2410000	2411000	Watch...
2411000	2412000	Watch us.
2412000	2414000	Because we're...
2414000	2415000	There.
2416000	2417000	And we're bright.
2418000	2419000	At night.
2420000	2422000	We put the Z in movies.
2424000	2425000	I like it.
2425000	2426000	I'll watch them.
2429000	2430000	Their slogan is,
2430000	2433000	Because you wouldn't watch writers.
2436000	2438000	And they just have a picture of us, me and Amy,
2438000	2440000	with potato chips in our hands.
2442000	2444000	Because who wants to watch writers?
2444000	2445000	And then it pans to me and they're like,
2445000	2446000	No, we don't want to watch him.
2447000	2448000	We said Stars!
2448000	2449000	Do we get HBO?
2450000	2452000	But anyways, the show you're working on,
2452000	2454000	I got so excited you just describing it.
2454000	2455000	J.K. Simmons, who's...
2455000	2458000	I love Since Law and Order.
2459000	2460000	Since Law and Order?
2460000	2461000	Well, yeah.
2461000	2463000	That's your J.K. reference?
2463000	2465000	What is he before that?
2465000	2466000	Spider-Man.
2466000	2468000	We saw Oz, which was an awesome show.
2468000	2470000	No, that's after Law and Order, though, isn't it?
2470000	2471000	Well, that's true.
2471000	2472000	Yeah, so I'm OG.
2475000	2477000	I got so scared I was going to find out.
2477000	2478000	He was Butch Cassidy.
2479000	2481000	No, I could have sworn that was Paul Newman.
2484000	2487000	I thought I was going to get really shamed for, you know...
2487000	2490000	But no, I'm clearly the superior J.K. Simmons fan.
2490000	2492000	I was like, who's that guy that they're going to?
2492000	2494000	I hope this person's mentally ill,
2494000	2495000	or at least there's a question of it.
2495000	2496000	Because he would play the...
2496000	2498000	Because that means we get to see that guy.
2498000	2500000	A.M.I.L. Skoda was his character's name.
2500000	2502000	Then I saw him in Juno, and I was like,
2502000	2504000	I like that guy again.
2505000	2507000	I hope he's in all the stuff.
2507000	2508000	And then he was.
2509000	2510000	That's me.
2511000	2514000	So we can talk about the show, right?
2514000	2515000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2515000	2519000	You said it's called Point of Departure.
2519000	2520000	Counterparts.
2520000	2521000	Counterparts.
2521000	2522000	Counterpart.
2522000	2523000	Counterpart, yes.
2523000	2524000	Counterpart.
2524000	2527000	It's about a split universe,
2527000	2529000	but the universe knows it's split.
2529000	2530000	Yes.
2530000	2532000	It's like parallel timelines that shared one history,
2532000	2535000	but they actively split, and they know they split.
2535000	2538000	So J.K. Simmons is playing two different versions of himself,
2538000	2541000	and it's like a spy Cold War thing going back.
2541000	2544000	Yeah, that's my audience.
2550000	2552000	Just in case somebody wasn't paying attention,
2552000	2554000	maybe repeat that.
2556000	2557000	Just in case.
2557000	2560000	No, their reaction made you think that you should have missed it.
2560000	2561000	See, that's what happens when you...
2561000	2563000	I don't know why I'm in this conversation.
2564000	2566000	You described it better than I could have, I think.
2566000	2567000	That's pretty great.
2567000	2568000	This is what I do. That's how I interview people.
2568000	2569000	It sounds like a really fucking cool show.
2569000	2570000	I bring them out, and I go,
2570000	2572000	your book's about autism.
2572000	2573000	And they go, it is?
2573000	2575000	And I'm like, gank-a-buck-a-boo-ga-boo-ga-boo.
2575000	2577000	Let's have a hand.
2579000	2581000	I'm getting a little sick of myself lately.
2582000	2584000	Well, I mean, anything else to say about it?
2584000	2585000	You guys are working on it.
2585000	2586000	Do you think it's good?
2586000	2587000	You can't say otherwise.
2587000	2589000	No, it's actually really good.
2590000	2594000	There's a genre that they've invented for the show called Spyfy?
2596000	2597000	I'll take it. I like it.
2597000	2598000	No.
2599000	2601000	You won't take it, will we?
2601000	2604000	No, listen, I love the genre.
2604000	2605000	I love the idea of the genre.
2605000	2607000	That name is way too cute.
2608000	2610000	I'm not okay with that at all.
2610000	2612000	The show is not cute.
2612000	2614000	Well, the why aren't I, Spyfy?
2614000	2615000	Yeah, exactly.
2615000	2616000	Good question.
2616000	2617000	Do you know?
2617000	2618000	Who fucking knows?
2618000	2619000	Well, we're going to find out.
2619000	2620000	The good way.
2620000	2621000	It's going to start out spelled the right way,
2621000	2623000	and then right around the time you really get into it,
2623000	2625000	they're going to change the spelling of it.
2625000	2627000	And then all the content is just going to go to hell.
2627000	2628000	You mean like those fucking Berenstein Bears?
2628000	2630000	Like the Berenstein Bears.
2630000	2631000	Exactly like them.
2631000	2633000	Will, have I ever told you about that?
2633000	2634000	Yeah.
2634000	2635000	No, Will was just going on about that.
2635000	2636000	Oh, man.
2636000	2638000	You guys all know about it.
2638000	2641000	I swear to God, five years before this hit the internet,
2641000	2645000	I was like, you guys dare to change the names on the Bears.
2645000	2648000	And then like now, you know, no one cared or believe me.
2648000	2653000	But now, now fucking everyone's on that goddamn Berenstein Bears track.
2653000	2656000	You're like the hipster of Berenstein Bears.
2656000	2657000	Yeah.
2657000	2662000	Are you being like a reality blurring event hipster right now?
2662000	2663000	Yeah.
2663000	2666000	I was there before reality blurred and, you know,
2666000	2667000	no one believed it was blurred yet.
2667000	2668000	Yeah, but that's the whole point.
2668000	2670000	We were all there before reality blurred,
2670000	2673000	which is why we all remember the name being the right way.
2673000	2675000	And we know that it's not the way it is now.
2675000	2677000	Do you guys know what the Berenstein Bears thing is?
2677000	2678000	All right.
2678000	2679000	Then I don't have to explain.
2679000	2680000	You can Google it.
2680000	2681000	Another thing.
2681000	2682000	Your name changed.
2682000	2683000	Okay.
2683000	2684000	Continue.
2684000	2687000	Another thing you should goggle is Will's show.
2687000	2688000	Goggle.
2688000	2689000	What are you saying?
2689000	2690000	It's pronounced goggle.
2690000	2691000	It always has.
2691000	2696000	I could have done that for an hour.
2696000	2700000	But I'm not that confident.
2700000	2703000	But at Geek and Sundry, is your thing,
2703000	2704000	because I know you did that show, Caper.
2704000	2707000	I watched an episode of that today and Felicia,
2707000	2709000	executive producer, because that was on Geek and Sundry
2709000	2711000	and Hulu at the same time, because you guys had to deal
2711000	2712000	with Hulu.
2712000	2715000	Is Tabletop on Hulu as well?
2715000	2717000	I don't know.
2717000	2719000	You know, I think we talked to them about it.
2719000	2722000	I know it's on Netflix, but I don't know if it's on Hulu.
2722000	2727000	But I do know that it has a huge audience on the Pirate Bay,
2727000	2730000	which I think is awesome, because it lets me know that,
2730000	2733000	like, there's a lot of people that want to watch this
2733000	2735000	that, for whatever reason, I don't know,
2735000	2737000	YouTube has blocked in their country or something?
2737000	2738000	Oh, yeah, that's right.
2738000	2739000	It's the geo-blocking thing.
2739000	2740000	It explains a lot of the piracy,
2740000	2742000	because it's like people don't want to watch a Pearl
2742000	2743000	commercial, you know?
2743000	2744000	But I think it's cool.
2744000	2747000	I think, like, when there's an audience demand for a show
2747000	2749000	that isn't being served in some way,
2749000	2751000	and the audience is like, give us the show!
2752000	2753000	I love that.
2753000	2754000	Of course.
2754000	2757000	I mean, it's like, well, yeah, how do you feel about piracy?
2757000	2759000	Well, we're supposed to be making things that are
2759000	2761000	basically free and addictive, and we're like,
2761000	2764000	we're going to get offended that, yeah, it's dumb.
2765000	2769000	I view piracy as a failure on behalf of the industry
2769000	2771000	to serve the needs of the audience.
2771000	2772000	Of course.
2772000	2773000	And they would, too, if they knew how to serve them,
2773000	2775000	because then they could charge them.
2775000	2778000	Like, we were, you know, oh, God, MP3 technology.
2778000	2779000	Oh, my God.
2779000	2782000	And then iTunes is like, no, that means now you can listen
2782000	2784000	to music more than ever for a dollar.
2784000	2785000	And everyone's like, that's fine.
2785000	2787000	And Apple's like, we have a billion dollars.
2787000	2788000	And everyone's like, that's fine, too.
2788000	2789000	Yeah.
2789000	2790000	Music industry saved.
2790000	2791000	Oh, good news.
2791000	2794000	We wasted 15 of your life taking it to the Supreme Court,
2794000	2796000	like we did with cassette tapes before that.
2796000	2798000	Well, home taping is killing music.
2798000	2799000	I've seen the tapes.
2801000	2807000	But anyways, the show, Tabletop, I'm like,
2807000	2809000	you turned me around on something.
2809000	2811000	It took somebody who's passionate as you,
2811000	2813000	because there has been this revolution.
2813000	2816000	As you say in the show, like, once upon a time,
2816000	2818000	there was this thing called D&D.
2818000	2821000	And people of our generation were like, oh,
2821000	2824000	the pencils and the dice and the complicated rules
2824000	2827000	and the million books and just the Harry Potter
2827000	2830000	but more complicated of it all, that's the secret society of it.
2830000	2833000	Like, the fact that it was the opposite of football,
2833000	2835000	including the fact that if you talked about it
2835000	2838000	with other people, they would actually actively,
2838000	2840000	like, back up from you.
2840000	2843000	And that was kind of like part of the appeal.
2843000	2845000	You have completely described my child.
2845000	2847000	Me too, mine too, yeah.
2847000	2849000	It's the same thing.
2849000	2850000	That's what kids do.
2850000	2851000	They're going to be exceptional.
2851000	2853000	They have to practice being exceptional in school
2853000	2855000	while the other kids practice being part of a horrible,
2855000	2857000	mindless horde.
2857000	2860000	And they end up doing great because everything is for them.
2860000	2863000	And not a tear in my eye for them.
2864000	2866000	But the rest of us,
2866000	2868000	and sometimes it seems like the majority of us,
2868000	2870000	we're also practicing in that grade
2870000	2872000	and we have to practice like fucking not giving a shit.
2872000	2874000	And so this is not my point.
2874000	2877000	Your point was that people like me,
2877000	2879000	I'm one of these people that you were kind of talking about
2879000	2881000	between the lines as like a purist
2881000	2883000	who therefore, when I hear the word tabletop,
2883000	2885000	I'm like, eh, you mean like,
2885000	2887000	ever since Magic the Gathering, I think,
2887000	2889000	was the sort of beginning of it for me in my experience.
2889000	2890000	It was like, wait.
2890000	2891000	That's a fine game.
2891000	2893000	Well, I mean, it's a look.
2893000	2894000	Yes, okay.
2894000	2898000	What the hell am I in the middle of saying that I was wrong?
2898000	2900000	But it was like, oh, it's cards,
2900000	2901000	but instead of the thing, you know,
2901000	2903000	it's like somehow it was wrong.
2903000	2905000	So he does this show called Tabletop
2905000	2908000	where he's just very, very enthusiastic
2908000	2911000	about the million types of games that are sort of like,
2911000	2914000	they're halfway between those things that we used to play
2914000	2915000	that are really complicated
2915000	2917000	and things that we remember
2917000	2920000	from our other half of our childhood, like Monopoly
2920000	2922000	when Mom and Dad weren't fighting,
2922000	2925000	like the shoots and ladders and, you know,
2925000	2928000	like there's something between, there's this new era
2928000	2929000	of these thousands of games,
2929000	2933000	somewhere between board game and role-playing.
2933000	2935000	It is weird to play ants in the pants
2935000	2938000	without the sound of dishes breaking in the kitchen.
2938000	2942000	That is a strange experience for me.
2942000	2944000	You know, when Felicia asked me
2944000	2946000	if I wanted to do a show for Geek and Sundry,
2946000	2950000	I said yes because she's, everything that she's done
2950000	2952000	has been really smart and really interesting,
2952000	2956000	and I love the idea of being able to create
2956000	2960000	and produce in a medium where I wasn't going to be
2960000	2962000	answering to like a network douchebag
2962000	2965000	who didn't understand the audience.
2965000	2967000	I did that when I worked with sci-fi.
2967000	2971000	But with this show, she said, so what do you want to do?
2971000	2972000	And I said, you know, I don't know.
2972000	2974000	I want to do something, but I don't know what.
2974000	2975000	And she said, well, how about a show
2975000	2976000	where you review board games?
2976000	2978000	I know how much you love board games.
2978000	2979000	And I said, you know, I think honestly,
2979000	2981000	the best way to review a board game
2981000	2982000	is to just play the board game
2982000	2984000	and show people how much fun it is.
2984000	2987000	And the idea like exploded in my brain.
2987000	2989000	Like it all came together all at once.
2989000	2990000	I will be the first person to say,
2990000	2992000	on paper, that sounds like a really terrible idea.
2992000	2995000	Like you literally play a game with your family
2995000	2996000	for two episodes.
2996000	2998000	Like it's your family.
2998000	3001000	Yes.
3001000	3002000	That just sounds like...
3002000	3003000	Not really sure where you're going with that.
3003000	3005000	You know exactly where I'm going,
3005000	3006000	because you know how that sounds on paper.
3006000	3007000	Yeah, but my family's rad.
3007000	3010000	I know it turns out, but it turns out...
3010000	3014000	I wouldn't put my family on my show if they were lame.
3014000	3016000	I'd be like, sorry, guys.
3016000	3017000	By the way, your kids are...
3017000	3019000	I'm going to hire some actors to be my family who are lame.
3019000	3022000	Did you adopt from Asgard or something?
3022000	3024000	Your children are...
3024000	3027000	You have two boys at that table.
3027000	3029000	They both are nine feet tall.
3029000	3030000	They look like...
3030000	3032000	They both look four.
3032000	3033000	Yeah.
3033000	3035000	In fact, my son Nolan's in Germany right now,
3035000	3038000	and people keep coming up to him and taking pictures with him,
3038000	3042000	because they're like, Thor, Thor, Thor.
3042000	3044000	Dave Klein likes that.
3044000	3047000	He's descended from Thor as well.
3047000	3049000	It's interesting that you say it sounds like a bad idea,
3049000	3053000	because I thought that the success of a show like Celebrity Poker
3053000	3056000	and the success of...
3056000	3058000	Just shows where you watch people...
3058000	3060000	You know, you watch people play cards and stuff.
3060000	3063000	I thought, well, this is something that I'm super passionate about,
3063000	3066000	and what's going to make the show live is not what's happening on the table.
3066000	3068000	It's what's happening with the people around the table.
3068000	3070000	I was a huge fan of Dinner for Five,
3070000	3073000	and I wanted to put together those two shows
3073000	3078000	and have people come in and just play these games that I love.
3078000	3080000	Well, it works really well.
3080000	3085000	One of the things that makes it work really well is that you played this game Dread,
3085000	3089000	which is this indie game that is a stack of things you can't call Jenga,
3089000	3092000	and it's just a collaborative...
3092000	3095000	Similar to, but legally distinctly different from Jenga.
3095000	3097000	It's just a collaborative storytelling game
3097000	3099000	where you were walking three players through this scenario
3099000	3102000	and they were role-playing and they had their characters figured out,
3102000	3104000	which were figured out by questionnaires,
3104000	3107000	like psychological profiles that you answer for a fictional character that you make up,
3107000	3109000	and then you're just going through it,
3109000	3111000	and instead of rolling dice, you pull...
3111000	3114000	It sounds a little dumb, but it worked as a storytelling thing.
3114000	3118000	At key points of the story, you have to keep pulling these Jenga blocks out.
3118000	3121000	And then as the story becomes more intense
3121000	3124000	and as the stakes get higher and higher
3124000	3127000	and the players are more like their adrenaline is up,
3127000	3130000	the tower is becoming more and more unstable
3130000	3132000	because you're pulling blocks out of it,
3132000	3135000	and when the tower falls, the player pulling from it dies.
3135000	3136000	That's it. You're dead.
3136000	3139000	And as an actual narrative, it is...
3139000	3140000	It's a great metaphor.
3140000	3141000	It's inevitable.
3141000	3143000	When you're watching a movie, you know that this can't last,
3143000	3145000	otherwise it would be a bad movie.
3145000	3148000	Like this camping trip, someone's going to die,
3148000	3151000	and when you're in a really scary situation, that's what scares you.
3151000	3153000	You feel like something's going to happen.
3153000	3157000	That was one of my favorite episodes we've done in three seasons,
3157000	3159000	and it means a lot to me that I'm really glad that you liked it
3159000	3162000	because I wanted to do a thing that was about storytelling.
3162000	3163000	Right.
3163000	3165000	Because I wanted to...
3165000	3169000	Because your skills as a GM,
3169000	3172000	I thought were astounding in that thing when you watch it.
3172000	3174000	Your ability to actually...
3174000	3178000	Your tonality and your pacing and your making...
3178000	3180000	It just...
3180000	3181000	And then the thing I thought was,
3181000	3183000	holy shit, we've got to play something with Will,
3183000	3185000	and it's like, oh, he'll play Shadowrun with us
3185000	3186000	and Amy will play with us and stuff.
3186000	3190000	But also, then I thought of this game,
3190000	3192000	Werewolf, that we always played,
3192000	3196000	that Justin Reiland introduced me to with this stupid deck thing.
3196000	3197000	What do you...
3197000	3199000	No, you don't like Justin?
3200000	3203000	No, I love Justin.
3203000	3206000	Were you thinking about the Hollywood Bowl again?
3206000	3209000	No, no, no.
3209000	3210000	All right, I'm going to try it because...
3210000	3211000	Pulling out cards.
3211000	3214000	We're going to play a game.
3214000	3216000	Just talk to Amy Burger about writing science fiction
3216000	3220000	for while I write a W on one of these pieces of paper.
3220000	3221000	Hi.
3221000	3222000	Hi.
3222000	3225000	So, tell us about your science fiction.
3230000	3237000	It has a lot of science in it, and it's made up.
3237000	3238000	It's pretty great.
3238000	3239000	Awesome.
3239000	3240000	You know what?
3240000	3241000	There's people here for this.
3241000	3242000	Someone do this.
3242000	3244000	Here, I'm throwing this one away.
3244000	3246000	We just got started, Dan.
3246000	3248000	One, two, three, four, five.
3248000	3249000	Demurge wasn't here, right?
3249000	3251000	I don't see Demurge wasn't here.
3251000	3252000	No?
3252000	3253000	Okay.
3253000	3254000	All right.
3254000	3256000	I need to...
3256000	3258000	Hey, Steve Levy, come out here.
3258000	3259000	Yeah.
3263000	3266000	If Jeff were here, he'd say, and the crowd goes mild.
3266000	3267000	All right.
3267000	3269000	So, first thing I need is for somebody to write
3269000	3271000	one, two, three, four, five...
3271000	3272000	He's asking you to do stuff.
3272000	3273000	...six...
3273000	3274000	No, he's up here playing with us.
3274000	3275000	He's playing?
3275000	3276000	Yeah.
3278000	3281000	I need somebody to turn this wad of envelopes
3281000	3286000	in this pen into six identical sheets of paper,
3287000	3289000	five of which have a...
3289000	3291000	Oh, God damn it.
3291000	3292000	What?
3292000	3294000	I am able to do it.
3294000	3296000	What's that?
3296000	3297000	Yeah.
3297000	3299000	Five of them will have a V on them,
3299000	3300000	and one of them will have a W on it.
3300000	3301000	It's just that simple.
3301000	3302000	Oh, Christ.
3302000	3304000	What are you doing right now?
3304000	3305000	What are you doing?
3305000	3307000	I'm talking under my breath.
3307000	3308000	No, you're not.
3308000	3309000	You're talking to a microphone.
3309000	3310000	I know.
3310000	3312000	It's the opposite of breath.
3312000	3314000	Your breath is ruining the world.
3314000	3317000	It's above my breath, then.
3317000	3322000	Your attitude is discouraging and disappointing.
3322000	3323000	I like it.
3323000	3325000	And you know, I came here tonight with a good attitude,
3325000	3327000	and my attitude is great.
3327000	3330000	This game fucking sucks.
3330000	3332000	You like this game?
3332000	3333000	No, I don't.
3333000	3334000	You just turned out to be doing it.
3334000	3335000	I fucking hate this game.
3335000	3338000	You just always lose.
3338000	3340000	I'd rather play baseball than this shit.
3340000	3341000	I'd rather play baseball than this shit.
3341000	3342000	You go play baseball.
3342000	3344000	You play fucking baseball.
3344000	3347000	Does anybody have a copy of Ants in the Pants?
3347000	3350000	I feel like I should be playing it right now.
3350000	3352000	This is the reason why I don't like games.
3352000	3355000	Somebody just ignore him.
3355000	3357000	Six sheets of paper.
3357000	3360000	Somebody, God damn it.
3360000	3362000	Five of them have a V.
3362000	3363000	One of them has a W.
3363000	3364000	Don't fuck around.
3364000	3367000	I know those are similar letters.
3367000	3368000	It's not going to be...
3368000	3372000	Your joke's not going to land if there's a confusion.
3372000	3376000	We might have a good time.
3376000	3377000	You're in charge...
3377000	3379000	Dustin, you're in charge.
3379000	3382000	Because I'm going to GM even though Will would do a much better job.
3382000	3384000	No, I'm awful at running werewolf.
3384000	3385000	Game Master.
3385000	3390000	I'm so much better, you're going to see.
3390000	3394000	So, Dustin, when I cue you...
3394000	3395000	How do we know...
3395000	3396000	Wait, wait, wait.
3396000	3400000	How do we know who's looking at who when it comes time to kill people?
3400000	3403000	Because we're all standing in a line.
3403000	3406000	We got to stand too?
3406000	3407000	To play werewolf.
3407000	3408000	Shut up.
3408000	3409000	Nobody has to see you but me.
3409000	3412000	Nobody's asking for any of your input on any of this.
3412000	3413000	You guys are pissing me off.
3413000	3414000	I'm going to fucking...
3414000	3423000	I'm going to dig a hole and stick you all in it and call it a tabletop game called Fuck the Fuck Faces.
3423000	3424000	What the fuck?
3424000	3425000	You're going to dig a hole.
3425000	3426000	You're going to dig a hole.
3426000	3427000	You're going to dig a hole.
3427000	3428000	Steve Lee, he's going to dig a hole.
3428000	3430000	You guys want to talk about hang gliding?
3430000	3431000	You dumb pieces of shit.
3431000	3433000	What the fuck do you want to do?
3433000	3434000	It's my goddamn show.
3434000	3436000	We're going to play fucking werewolf.
3436000	3437000	You're making it longer.
3437000	3438000	Right.
3438000	3439000	Stop yelling.
3439000	3440000	Then it wouldn't have to be.
3440000	3441000	Stop yelling.
3441000	3442000	You're hurting his feelings.
3442000	3443000	He's already finished.
3443000	3444000	All right.
3444000	3449000	So, anyways, let's have some fun.
3449000	3453000	And if it doesn't work, Spencer, I tried something.
3453000	3455000	I just want to troubleshoot, you know, so we can...
3455000	3457000	You shoot yourself, not trouble.
3457000	3459000	Avoid the problem when it comes up.
3459000	3461000	You're mad because you see what's happening.
3461000	3462000	I'm threatening you.
3462000	3463000	I'm not mad.
3463000	3465000	I'm not going to turn this into a whole thing.
3465000	3466000	I'm pissing.
3466000	3469000	I'm not going to become a game master professionally.
3469000	3473000	You're going to become a GM.
3473000	3474000	It's going to work.
3474000	3478000	And I made up my mind about something, and I'm at a very volatile point in my life.
3478000	3484000	And Will Wheaton's here, and you guys are fucking around.
3484000	3488000	And that V looks a lot like a fucking W.
3488000	3490000	He's looking at the cards.
3490000	3491000	He's already cheating.
3491000	3492000	He's the GM.
3492000	3493000	It's fine.
3493000	3494000	Yeah, I'm cheating.
3494000	3497000	I know that if I'm going to fucking murder...
3497000	3499000	This is why I never win.
3499000	3502000	It's because he cheats all the time.
3502000	3507000	Yeah, because if I'm going to look at the card, I'm going to hold him close to my chest.
3507000	3512000	All right, so, Dustin, do you have scary music, like creepy ambient music?
3512000	3515000	Oh, yeah.
3515000	3518000	Get ready for some scary music.
3518000	3525000	I don't suppose you also have kind of nice world of common day music, so we could go
3525000	3528000	back between the two when I cue you?
3528000	3531000	It'd be really cool if we had Castlevania songs.
3531000	3533000	You could have the Day and the Night thing.
3533000	3535000	Yeah!
3535000	3538000	Yeah, man, Castlevania!
3538000	3542000	Has anybody in this room gotten to the last level of Castlevania?
3542000	3543000	No, man.
3543000	3544000	Right?
3544000	3547000	Like, you can't even get past the level with the Medusa heads, right?
3547000	3548000	With the stairs?
3548000	3549000	Fuck those guys.
3549000	3550000	Yeah.
3550000	3552000	Yeah, it's awful, and it's so harsh.
3552000	3554000	The stairs are no good in that game at all.
3554000	3555000	What is he doing?
3555000	3556000	He's handing out the things.
3556000	3559000	He's going through with this.
3559000	3561000	Okay, nobody look at these.
3561000	3564000	I mean, you can look at them, but don't look at them.
3564000	3565000	Show them to other people.
3565000	3566000	Don't let them sit.
3566000	3567000	Don't cheat.
3567000	3570000	So you either have a V or a W. If you have a W, you're the werewolf.
3570000	3574000	And so everything else is basically kind of self-explanatory.
3574000	3575000	You gave me two.
3575000	3577000	Well, you could pick which one you want.
3577000	3579000	What do you mean?
3579000	3581000	Does one have a V and one has a W?
3581000	3583000	No, one's blank and one has a letter on it.
3583000	3584000	I solved the problem.
3584000	3585000	They both have letters on them, okay.
3585000	3586000	Pick one you want.
3586000	3587000	Start over!
3587000	3588000	No, no, we're good.
3588000	3589000	We're good.
3589000	3591000	You guys are doing this on purpose.
3591000	3592000	I'm good.
3592000	3593000	You're not good.
3593000	3596000	You can't do it that way.
3596000	3597000	Steve's good.
3597000	3599000	No, he's not good.
3599000	3601000	No, give me your papers back.
3601000	3602000	Give them back.
3602000	3603000	It has the same letter.
3603000	3605000	We're going to have fucking fun tonight.
3605000	3607000	Give me your papers back.
3607000	3609000	Pieces of shit, give them back.
3611000	3612000	I'm having a ball.
3612000	3613000	Pieces of shit.
3613000	3614000	You were a villager.
3614000	3615000	Yeah, no, I was.
3615000	3616000	I knew it.
3616000	3617000	Who was the werewolf?
3617000	3619000	I think it was Amy Bird.
3619000	3620000	Oh, who was the werewolf?
3620000	3621000	Shut up.
3621000	3622000	That's my guess.
3622000	3623000	No!
3623000	3624000	I'm angry with all of you.
3624000	3625000	Spencer was right about that.
3625000	3626000	Yeah, no, I know.
3626000	3627000	I'm really sorry.
3627000	3628000	What about the werewolf?
3628000	3629000	I tweeted Will about this.
3629000	3630000	I was like, what if we played werewolf?
3630000	3631000	I was so excited.
3631000	3632000	And he's like, I don't know if that'll work.
3632000	3633000	And I was like, fuck you, Will Wheaton.
3633000	3634000	Fuck you!
3634000	3635000	Two!
3635000	3636000	Fuck you!
3636000	3637000	You don't know anything about Amy?
3637000	3647000	I was a little taken aback by the use of all caps and the emojis were very intense.
3648000	3653000	The Black Santa means I'm kidding.
3653000	3656000	I really wish I'd known that six hours ago.
3656000	3659000	I mean, we'll wait.
3659000	3662000	You guys are texting each other?
3662000	3665000	Yeah, no, I'm going to text you instead.
3665000	3668000	Maybe if you had more fun playing games, you could get in on this.
3668000	3669000	God damn it.
3669000	3670000	Thank you, sir.
3670000	3676000	Never returns my shit texts.
3676000	3679000	Make it real discreet.
3679000	3682000	God forbid this was done wrong.
3682000	3684000	All right.
3684000	3686000	I counted too many.
3686000	3687000	That's what happened.
3687000	3689000	That's not a werewolf.
3689000	3690000	So, okay.
3690000	3691000	We did it.
3691000	3692000	We did it.
3692000	3695000	Okay.
3695000	3696000	Have a good night, everybody.
3696000	3697000	Okay.
3697000	3698000	So here we go.
3698000	3699000	We're just going to play.
3699000	3700000	We're just going to play.
3700000	3702000	You know how to play.
3702000	3703000	You guys know.
3703000	3705000	You guys know what's going on.
3705000	3706000	Is this the scary music?
3706000	3707000	I think it has a copy.
3707000	3708000	This is ordinary.
3708000	3712000	You know stories don't start scary, Amy Berg.
3712000	3717000	You know it starts with the nice version of J.K. Simmons hanging out in his village.
3717000	3720000	Where we began our story.
3720000	3724000	The village of Happytown.
3724000	3731000	Where everyone makes their own corn and hangs out and likes each other and people who know
3731000	3741000	each other for 20 years treat each other with respect.
3741000	3749000	They overcome their compulsions for irony and pettiness.
3749000	3753000	And they remember that the town is what's important.
3753000	3756000	You're going to eat that chip.
3756000	3759000	Are we in a neighboring village?
3760000	3776000	However, there's a darkness to every town.
3776000	3784000	A sinister underbelly which kind of sounds like more of a relaxing quit smoking tape.
3784000	3787000	Which is really sinister if you don't want to quit smoking tape.
3787000	3790000	You feel like you have to.
3790000	3799000	A part of the town where cravings no longer exist.
3799000	3804000	Where self-confidence is heightened the following day at work.
3804000	3807000	Through the use of dark magics.
3807000	3811000	And one of the most horrific symptoms of this dark underbelly.
3811000	3817000	The insatiable bloodthirsty lycanthrope.
3817000	3821000	Otherwise known as the werewolf.
3821000	3827000	Werewolf here wolf here in the town of Happytown.
3827000	3831000	One of these villagers up here is not just a villager.
3831000	3838000	One of you is a fucking monster.
3838000	3843000	But during the day you walk around and you hang out and you act like friends.
3843000	3847000	And then at night you turn into dickheads.
3847000	3850000	Monsters. Monster dickheads.
3850000	3855000	Because it's not enough. Everything's going to be eaten and destroyed.
3858000	3860000	What do I do in this town?
3860000	3862000	I watch everyone go to sleep.
3862000	3864000	That means you close your eyes.
3864000	3866000	Everyone up here close your eyes.
3866000	3867000	Am I married?
3867000	3870000	Lower the lights. Close the eyes.
3870000	3873000	Hang your heads down. All of you hang your heads down.
3873000	3878000	And do not be in a position where you would be able to see what any of the other people are doing.
3878000	3881000	Okay? Don't be dicks about this.
3881000	3884000	Do not fuck me on this.
3884000	3890000	This is a fun game and you're going to have fun and you're going to eat shit and die.
3892000	3894000	Lower the lights. Just a little bit.
3894000	3898000	Okay. We're worried about the cameras. Okay. I get it. I get it. I get it.
3898000	3899000	I'm covering my eyes.
3899000	3904000	You're not talking when you sleep. You're a villager and you're sleeping.
3904000	3910000	And you're all dreaming about corn and villaging.
3910000	3913000	But one of you isn't dreaming.
3913000	3920000	One of you spent his day dreaming that he or she was a man or a woman.
3924000	3937000	But that's a different issue that we're not going to tackle with this game.
3937000	3940000	Because you have a right to think whatever you want when you go to bed.
3940000	3943000	It doesn't matter which of you we're thinking. Whatever.
3943000	3946000	That's absolutely your own thing.
3946000	3950000	Unless the government tries to step it away and we'll deal with that together.
3950000	3953000	And even the werewolves will help us at that point.
3953000	3958000	Because there are monsters out there that are scarier than werewolves called bigotry.
3958000	3962000	All right. Have I said enough of that shit? Can we move on?
3962000	3967000	Jesus Christ. I'm from the 70s. Man meant person.
3967000	3974000	All right. So one of you is a werewolf. One of you is a werewolf.
3975000	3991000	Will the person that is the werewolf very, very carefully indicate to me who you are as your wolfy wolfy wolfiness?
3991000	3996000	This werewolf cannot be quenched by sleep.
3997000	4001000	This werewolf needs human flesh.
4001000	4006000	And we'll go out its window into the village and kill one of the villagers.
4006000	4009000	Who will it be, werewolf?
4010000	4014000	Oh, werewolf.
4015000	4017000	Okay.
4017000	4026000	Regular music. Wake up. Wake up, everybody.
4026000	4030000	Oh, it's such a good day to eat some corn and hang out.
4030000	4034000	Because there's nothing wrong. Society's going to keep going the same way it did.
4034000	4038000	Oh, wait. What the fuck? Spencer's dead.
4040000	4044000	He's ripped open by the well and his blood is in the water.
4044000	4047000	Do I live next door to him? Yes.
4047000	4051000	I live next door to him. So I open up the window and I see him ripped up.
4051000	4056000	It's not that much of a role playing game. Yes, that's what happens.
4056000	4059000	Did he do something important in our town?
4059000	4062000	Spencer, did you do something important in the town?
4062000	4067000	Oh, yeah, I was. No, there was just villagers and werewolves.
4067000	4069000	All right, fade down the music.
4069000	4071000	Turns out I don't miss you then.
4071000	4073000	No one ever does.
4073000	4078000	You guys have a serious problem because I'm the doctor of this town.
4078000	4082000	And I recognize this as werewolf bites.
4082000	4085000	That means that one of you is a werewolf.
4085000	4092000	And that means you've got to figure out, before sundown, you've got to hang somebody.
4092000	4095000	You have to kill somebody that might be the werewolf.
4095000	4096000	Yes, Rob?
4096000	4100000	If he was bit, doesn't he turn into a werewolf?
4100000	4104000	He was bit all the way to death.
4104000	4106000	He was eaten.
4106000	4108000	It's not like a vampire.
4108000	4110000	It's not like a vampire, though.
4110000	4113000	Except there's biting involved.
4113000	4117000	And sometimes you turn into the thing that bit you, but that's also zombies.
4117000	4124000	I saw a thing once where a vampire turned into a wolf.
4124000	4128000	Who's right? You are the movie I watched.
4128000	4131000	Why am I, why is it either of those?
4131000	4134000	Why do I have to be against this movie?
4134000	4139000	If a werewolf, if a vampire is immortal, then I would understand.
4139000	4144000	If a werewolf bit a vampire, then obviously the vampire would turn into a werewolf vampire.
4144000	4147000	I have no quarrel with the writer of that.
4147000	4150000	Okay, okay. I just want clarification.
4150000	4152000	Roger Corman says thank you.
4152000	4155000	I thought we were talking about underworld.
4156000	4162000	I'll take a side of that beckonsail for my, I was going to do a wordplay.
4162000	4163000	I'll go take a...
4163000	4167000	Put some of those beckonsails on my boat.
4167000	4169000	They can blow me around.
4169000	4172000	They keep saying off on that beckonsail.
4172000	4175000	Those sails are beckoning me.
4175000	4178000	Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow.
4178000	4180000	All this week, a beckonsail.
4180000	4182000	Figure out who's the werewolf.
4182000	4184000	I know who the werewolf is.
4184000	4186000	You're fucking dead, shut up.
4186000	4188000	How do you think I know?
4188000	4190000	That's what I'm saying. He's talking.
4190000	4194000	You know, he seems alive.
4194000	4196000	Who do you think is the werewolf? There's only four of you.
4196000	4198000	9-11.
4198000	4199000	It's 9-11.
4199000	4200000	Oh shit.
4200000	4203000	Which is another, it's a...
4203000	4207000	I know. There are other things more important than werewolves.
4207000	4210000	Bigotry and 9-11. We get it.
4210000	4213000	I feel like there was something I was supposed to remember about this.
4214000	4217000	Alright, who's the werewolf?
4217000	4220000	You guys are ruining the game by not guessing.
4220000	4222000	Why does everyone fucking look at me?
4222000	4224000	It would be amazing if it were you, Shroff.
4224000	4225000	It would be amazing.
4225000	4229000	I want to vote for you to be the werewolf just because it's poetically perfect.
4229000	4232000	Oh no, maybe Will Wheaton's the werewolf.
4232000	4236000	Oh, maybe I am the werewolf and I'm trying to throw suspicion off from me.
4236000	4237000	Yeah.
4237000	4240000	Or maybe you're the werewolf and you're trying to throw suspicion onto me.
4240000	4241000	Could be, but...
4241000	4243000	You were the first one to look at me.
4243000	4244000	Me?
4244000	4245000	Yes.
4245000	4246000	I just love you.
4247000	4250000	Do you love him enough to eat him to death?
4250000	4252000	Like you ate Spencer to death?
4252000	4253000	You're pretty vocal.
4253000	4255000	Well, yeah.
4255000	4259000	I think Steve's getting really defensive right now, so he's clearly the werewolf.
4259000	4262000	Oh man. You're going to be so wrong.
4264000	4267000	Alright, I don't know how the process should work.
4267000	4270000	On the count of three, everyone pointed at who they think the werewolf is.
4270000	4271000	One, two, three.
4271000	4273000	Boo!
4273000	4274000	Oh man.
4274000	4276000	Oh shit.
4276000	4278000	You guys drag Steve Levy into the courtyard.
4278000	4281000	Oh, take off his pants, man.
4283000	4284000	And you take off his pants and you...
4284000	4286000	Take off that pants, man.
4286000	4287000	Take off them off.
4287000	4288000	Scary music.
4288000	4289000	Yeah.
4289000	4290000	Low lights.
4290000	4291000	Low lights, take off his pants.
4291000	4293000	Make it all sexy.
4293000	4294000	And you hang him.
4294000	4295000	Yeah.
4295000	4296000	You hang him and he dies.
4296000	4297000	Yeah.
4297000	4298000	Oh, we hang him.
4298000	4299000	But as he dies...
4299000	4300000	Oh, look at the pants are off.
4300000	4302000	He doesn't turn back and...
4302000	4306000	He doesn't turn briefly into a werewolf and then turn back into a person and say thank
4306000	4310000	you, which is what werewolves do when they die.
4310000	4312000	He simply hangs there and dies.
4312000	4317000	And I, the doctor, go up and I feel his foot and I go, this guy was human.
4317000	4320000	Why didn't you feel his foot before we hung up?
4320000	4322000	Because you can't tell unless the foot is dead.
4322000	4323000	Why?
4323000	4324000	Are you a doctor?
4324000	4325000	Here we come.
4325000	4326000	You four.
4326000	4328000	You hanged me, shrob.
4328000	4332000	Well, if I knew feeling the foot was an option, we would have gone.
4332000	4335000	You can only do that after they're dead.
4335000	4337000	Now three villagers remain.
4337000	4341000	And one is a werewolf.
4341000	4343000	Close your eyes and go to sleep, villagers.
4343000	4346000	I'm not tired.
4346000	4349000	I want to wake because somebody just got fucking mauled and hung.
4349000	4352000	You think I'm going to sleep in this shit?
4352000	4353000	Fuck that, man.
4353000	4354000	I'm sleeping.
4354000	4357000	My eyes open.
4357000	4358000	Yeah.
4358000	4359000	I'm with Rob.
4359000	4360000	Yeah.
4360000	4361000	Yeah.
4361000	4362000	We're going to stay up all night.
4362000	4363000	All right.
4363000	4364000	Fine.
4364000	4365000	Fine.
4365000	4366000	Stay up all night.
4366000	4367000	Fine.
4367000	4368000	Stay up all night.
4368000	4369000	Okay.
4369000	4370000	Fine.
4370000	4371000	That's what you do.
4371000	4372000	You stay up all night.
4372000	4373000	You stay up all night.
4373000	4374000	Turn daylight music back on.
4374000	4375000	You stay up all night.
4375000	4377000	So obviously one of you is still a werewolf that just stayed up all night with you.
4377000	4381000	And now you have to live tired with a werewolf all day again.
4381000	4382000	Shit.
4382000	4383000	Now go to sleep.
4383000	4384000	Now you're fucking tired.
4384000	4385000	And we can do that over and over all week.
4385000	4386000	You do it for a thousand years, you don't sleep.
4386000	4387000	Eventually you sleep.
4387000	4388000	Everyone sleeps.
4388000	4389000	All right.
4389000	4390000	You're going to sleep.
4390000	4391000	All right.
4391000	4392000	Now put the scary music on.
4392000	4393000	All right.
4393000	4394000	We're going to have fucking fun.
4394000	4395000	You're losing the audience.
4395000	4396000	You're losing the audience.
4396000	4397000	I'm not losing.
4397000	4398000	That guy has to take a shit.
4398000	4399000	Okay.
4399000	4400000	Scary, scary fun.
4400000	4401000	Fun, scary music.
4401000	4402000	Okay.
4402000	4403000	Okay.
4403000	4404000	Okay.
4404000	4405000	Okay.
4405000	4406000	Okay.
4406000	4407000	Okay.
4407000	4408000	Okay.
4408000	4409000	Okay.
4409000	4410000	Okay.
4410000	4411000	Okay.
4411000	4412000	Okay.
4412000	4413000	Okay.
4413000	4414000	Okay.
4414000	4415000	Okay.
4415000	4416000	Okay.
4416000	4417000	Okay.
4417000	4418000	Okay.
4418000	4419000	Okay.
4419000	4420000	Okay.
4420000	4421000	Okay.
4421000	4422000	Okay.
4422000	4423000	Okay.
4423000	4424000	Okay.
4424000	4425000	Okay.
4425000	4426000	All right.
4426000	4427000	I want you to tell all your friends about me.
4427000	4428000	He says.
4428000	4429000	Batman.
4429000	4430000	We lost Batman.
4430000	4431000	Why did he do anything?
4431000	4432000	The first guy you'd lose in a nuanced thing.
4432000	4433000	Two people have died already.
4433000	4434000	You think that well, he can't.
4434000	4435000	He's like, I'm going to go do something about this.
4435000	4436000	Go to sleep.
4436000	4437000	Batman's the werewolf.
4437000	4438000	All right.
4438000	4439000	I'm tired.
4439000	4440000	I gotta get up and work on the morning.
4440000	4441000	Oh God.
4441000	4442000	You don't like the game.
4442000	4444440	The best way to finish it is to do it.
4444440	4445440	So fun.
4445440	4446440	Go to sleep.
4446440	4450720	It's a very upset with all of you except, except, I don't know.
4450720	4454880	Well, Will and Amy has been fine.
4454880	4455880	And Steve.
4455880	4456880	Really?
4456880	4457880	It's a shrub, obviously.
4457880	4459640	And a little bit Spencer for egging you on.
4459640	4460640	I'm trying to help.
4460640	4461640	I don't.
4461640	4464560	Thank you for driving me around for two years.
4464560	4466560	I love it.
4466560	4468000	I'm trying to fucking sleep here.
4468000	4469000	Shut the fuck up.
4470000	4471000	All right.
4471000	4472000	You sleep to sleep.
4472000	4473000	Yeah.
4473000	4474000	The shrub kept us up all night last night.
4474000	4475000	I know.
4475000	4476000	It sucked.
4476000	4478000	It's so fucking hot.
4478000	4481000	It's hard to sleep even though you're tired.
4481000	4483000	So fucking tired of this game.
4483000	4486000	You know, there's no game.
4486000	4490000	You're in the game so you don't know there's a game.
4490000	4493000	That would be unmarketable.
4494000	4500000	Oh, that canine thirst for blood.
4500000	4509000	Oh, that lupine hunger for the kibble that cannot be provided by name brand products.
4511000	4521000	Oh, werewolf awake and indicate to me
4521000	4525000	who you are going to eat next.
4526000	4529000	I think I understand.
4535000	4536000	All right.
4536000	4538000	Normal music in daylight.
4538000	4539000	You guys wake up.
4539000	4541000	I'm still fucking alive.
4541000	4545000	And you're still tired because you wasted that whole night and it didn't help anything
4545000	4549000	because now I was strangled with typewriter ribbon
4549000	4553000	next to a half-finished TV pilot that would have been fucking great.
4553000	4554000	Oh, shit.
4554000	4555000	Because she's...
4555000	4556000	It could be me.
4556000	4558000	I could be a TV pilot writer.
4558000	4559000	Is it me?
4559000	4560000	Oh, shit.
4560000	4565000	We all know fully well the best writer up here is Amy Burt, now slain by werewolf.
4565000	4566000	Eaten.
4566000	4568000	Eaten devoured.
4568000	4571000	Her bones licked clean.
4571000	4573000	Yeah.
4573000	4574000	Your fault, kind of.
4574000	4576000	No, how is it my fault?
4576000	4578000	Because you fucked around.
4578000	4582000	Instead of playing the game, which you now have to do, it's a matter of life or death,
4582000	4583000	there is...
4583000	4584000	Wait.
4584000	4585000	Wait, how do you outvote each other?
4585000	4586000	There's two people.
4586000	4587000	Oh, you idiot.
4587000	4588000	You lost.
4588000	4589000	Wil Wheaton's the werewolf.
4589000	4590000	Fuck you.
4590000	4591000	You lost.
4592000	4594000	And that's fun.
4594000	4595000	But the day...
4595000	4596000	That was a fun game.
4596000	4600000	I had a lot of fun playing that game.
4600000	4602000	Eat the chip if you hate everything so much.
4602000	4604000	No, I'm not going to eat the chip.
4604000	4605000	Do it.
4605000	4607000	Yeah, everyone wants you to do it now.
4607000	4611000	Eat the chip.
4611000	4616000	Eat the chip, you pussy.
4616000	4618000	Now I'm not going to eat the chip.
4618000	4622000	I was going to wait for it to be really, really funny, and now I'm not going to even wait.
4622000	4627000	Yeah, but it's Chekhov's chip, man.
4627000	4630000	He's right, it's Chekhov's chip.
4630000	4633000	It's been there since the first act.
4634000	4637000	You read Chekhov's chip.
4637000	4640000	Rob loves reading.
4640000	4643000	That's why he loves me.
4646000	4647000	That's right.
4647000	4649000	Because you went to art school.
4649000	4650000	Right.
4650000	4651000	And I went to writing school.
4651000	4654000	You went to word school.
4654000	4659000	I went to word school and you went to art school.
4659000	4670000	Rob, when I met Rob, one of Rob's big pet peeves was the word utensil, which he swore was invented by smart people to make him feel stupid.
4670000	4671000	Writing utensil.
4671000	4672000	Writing utensil.
4672000	4674000	Oh yeah, the word is utensil.
4674000	4676000	Excuse me, could I have a writing utensil?
4676000	4679000	Just say pencil.
4679000	4681000	Yeah, but maybe you don't want a pencil.
4681000	4682000	Then say that.
4682000	4684000	But what if they're both there?
4684000	4685000	Then say what you want.
4685000	4687000	What if you don't know what's in the drawer?
4687000	4690000	You don't know what you want?
4690000	4695000	Maybe you want to be polite because you're talking to someone who's not that smart.
4695000	4697000	Okay, all right.
4697000	4699000	Do you hate instrument just as much?
4699000	4701000	No, I'm fine with that.
4701000	4703000	Writing instrument doesn't bother you?
4703000	4705000	Nope.
4705000	4706000	Writing utensil.
4706000	4711000	Could I have a writing utensil, please?
4711000	4715000	Just say pencil, dude.
4715000	4719000	I don't know, it might be hashtag Team Rob tonight.
4719000	4723000	Well, he's always more entertaining, but it's because he's disruptive.
4723000	4727000	He waits until something's happening and then he disrupts it.
4727000	4729000	That's like a luxury for him.
4729000	4732000	You know, if you sit around, everybody...
4741000	4744000	Yeah, must be nice having that job.
4744000	4746000	He's like Pizza Hut's Noid.
4746000	4747000	Was it Domino's?
4747000	4749000	Was the Noid from Domino's?
4749000	4752000	Do you know the reason why they stopped doing the Noid?
4752000	4753000	Because people didn't know?
4753000	4754000	No, no, no.
4754000	4755000	Does anybody know why?
4755000	4756000	Oh, yeah.
4756000	4757000	Oh, yeah.
4757000	4758000	Do you know, sir?
4758000	4761000	Stand up and tell the Wikipedia.
4761000	4764000	I think there was a dude who was actually named Noid.
4764000	4770000	He was paranoid that Domino's was talking to him.
4770000	4771000	Right.
4771000	4773000	Yeah, and then he went into...
4773000	4777000	A guy said, for those who didn't hear it, there was a guy whose name was Noid
4777000	4780000	who thought that Domino's was fucking with him.
4780000	4783000	He was talking to him through the television, so he went into a...
4783000	4786000	Not a Pizza Hut, the other one.
4786000	4788000	With a machine gun, thank you.
4788000	4791000	And started killing people.
4791000	4795000	Can we have one fucking story in America that doesn't end with someone
4795000	4799000	taking a gun somewhere and fucking murdering people?
4799000	4802000	I'm so fucking sick of this story.
4802000	4804000	Do you know there's one like...
4804000	4806000	What is it, 95 this year?
4806000	4808000	That's why we lost the Noid.
4808000	4809000	That's why we lost him?
4809000	4810000	Fuck that guy.
4810000	4812000	Yep.
4812000	4816000	The Noid was the one thing that couldn't possibly have had anything to do
4816000	4818000	with a mass shooting.
4818000	4820000	That's why you loved it.
4820000	4821000	We were like, this is safe.
4821000	4823000	Not anymore, apparently.
4823000	4825000	But how many is it this year, Steve?
4825000	4826000	How many school shootings?
4826000	4828000	Well, it was 45 school shootings.
4828000	4830000	In a year!
4830000	4832000	And now we're making fun of...
4832000	4833000	Not even.
4833000	4835000	Jeb Bush didn't know what school...
4835000	4837000	It's like, well, come on, it's getting to the fucking point
4837000	4840000	where the obscene thing is that it's hard to keep track.
4840000	4842000	It's a goddamn epidemic.
4842000	4843000	I don't know what my point is.
4843000	4844000	I'm not in a soap box.
4844000	4847000	There's no one on the other side of this issue.
4847000	4848000	I mean, there are.
4848000	4850000	Well, let's have a conversation about that.
4850000	4853000	Because I want to say, obviously, not a gun nut,
4853000	4855000	not a guy who's...
4855000	4857000	And it's hard to get into this conversation because everyone's
4857000	4859000	hyper-vigilant against which person are you.
4859000	4862000	But speaking as a person who just wants everyone to stop dying
4862000	4865000	and is absolutely fine with any legislation we need to make happen,
4865000	4868000	whatever makes people feel fine, because I've given up on this earth anyway.
4868000	4869000	It's not like I'm...
4869000	4871000	I'm like, I've got to make sure that Constitution is upheld perfectly.
4871000	4874000	I'm like, I don't give a fuck about you morons.
4874000	4876000	I'm not...
4876000	4877000	Fuck you.
4877000	4878000	I'm just kidding.
4878000	4879000	I love you.
4879000	4883000	But I was given a hard time during that werewolf game by all of you.
4883000	4887000	And it's just like, I don't want any of you to get shot,
4887000	4889000	but I also... I don't care about your Constitution.
4889000	4890000	Okay.
4890000	4891000	So...
4891000	4892000	But...
4892000	4894000	So we're focused on this legislative issue.
4894000	4895000	We're like...
4895000	4899000	Which, you know, obviously, if you are a person who's been saying for 30 years,
4899000	4903000	we need to, like, mitigate this legislatively every time one of these things happens,
4903000	4906000	obviously, it's going to be like a big fucking, like, you know,
4906000	4908000	in rageful, like, moment.
4908000	4911000	And obviously, if you're somebody that's always, like, worried that someone's
4911000	4913000	going to come take their guns, then you're going to, like,
4913000	4914000	play the other part in a lot of stuff.
4914000	4919000	But just outside of that Heathcliff fight with the claws going around,
4919000	4921000	like, like the...
4921000	4922000	Thank you, Will, Waiten.
4922000	4925000	I love that image so much.
4925000	4927000	The...
4927000	4929000	Hashtag in our rage.
4931000	4932000	The...
4932000	4934000	Are we going to... What are we going to...
4934000	4935000	What are we going to do?
4935000	4938000	What is step two in a hypothetical universe where we would say to all...
4938000	4939000	Because there's...
4939000	4941000	How many guns are in circulation in the last 30 years?
4941000	4943000	Like, we're going to be all deadshot or not.
4943000	4947000	Like, we're all going to be dead before legislation would stop the insanity.
4947000	4950000	There are more guns in America than there are people.
4950000	4951000	Yeah, so...
4951000	4953000	So is there another step to this?
4953000	4954000	Or are we going to, like...
4954000	4958000	No, we're not ever going to do anything about it because we sat by as a nation
4958000	4961000	and allowed a classroom full of six-year-olds to be murdered
4961000	4967000	and then would not even at a legislative level do the most fucking useless thing
4967000	4970000	that could possibly have been reasonably passed.
4970000	4974000	We as a nation went, no, it's way more important that we jerk off our guns
4974000	4978000	than our kids go to school without ever having to worry about dying.
4978000	4981000	I go into a movie theater and wonder, well, am I going to be another...
4981000	4983000	I mean, am I going to be on the news now?
4983000	4988000	Because fucking gun nuts, like, have created this delusion in their life
4988000	4991000	that, like, the president is going to walk up to their house and go,
4991000	4993000	give me your guns unless you have a lot of them.
4993000	4994000	Right.
4994000	4995000	It's insane.
4995000	4998000	So because we know...
4998000	5001000	We know that that's never going to happen because we're going to keep...
5001000	5003000	Because it's like a football game where we just keep...
5003000	5005000	But it's almost like our Ouija board or something
5005000	5007000	where people want to just go like this.
5007000	5009000	I'm not saying that neither side wants a resolution,
5009000	5015000	but I am saying, like, not only would you need to then have one of those teams win,
5015000	5019000	but then also in addition to that, you'd need definitely something else.
5019000	5020000	What is that something else?
5020000	5022000	Does anyone have a fucking idea?
5022000	5027000	Because, like, if you make guns completely illegal
5027000	5033000	to the point where the image of one is banned
5033000	5036000	and everyone's home is searched and you gather them up,
5036000	5038000	there's still going to be so many guns.
5038000	5040000	And is it...
5040000	5042000	I mean, is this a mental health issue?
5042000	5044000	It goes so much beyond this, right?
5044000	5047000	Is it some kind of, like, national psyche thing?
5047000	5048000	Like, no one ever...
5048000	5050000	Well, what the hell are we supposed to...
5050000	5051000	We're nuts.
5051000	5055000	We're obviously 300 million insane people collectively, right?
5055000	5059000	Yeah, I'm so angry about it that it's not possible for me to be rational.
5059000	5065000	I mean, I'm so, like, just blind, rage, fuck everyone who has a fucking assault rifle.
5065000	5069000	You're being more rational than I am because you're able to have the rationality
5069000	5072000	about the legislative thing, like, at least to be able to look at that.
5072000	5074000	I'm being less rational because I'm going, like,
5074000	5076000	Jesus fucking Christ, we're so fucked.
5076000	5081000	Like, we're just so much unlike any country in the world.
5081000	5085000	And when a presidential candidate responds to a shooting,
5085000	5088000	like the one we just had by saying, stuff happens,
5088000	5090000	we are beyond fucked.
5090000	5091000	Yeah.
5091000	5092000	Like, there's no way out.
5092000	5093000	Like, we're just...
5093000	5094000	So are we...
5094000	5098000	Isn't it, like, the absolute only solution you could possibly think of?
5098000	5102000	Like, there's no economic solution, there's no legislative issue.
5102000	5103000	There's tons of solutions.
5103000	5104000	What are the...
5104000	5107000	First of all, you do background checks, restrict who could get guns,
5107000	5108000	just make it a bit harder.
5108000	5109000	There's not any of that at all.
5109000	5111000	I mean, there's not none of that, but there's not...
5111000	5112000	It's not good at all.
5112000	5116000	Second of all, stop the manufacture of certain types of guns or new guns.
5116000	5118000	You don't have to take people's guns away.
5118000	5119000	You just stop new ones.
5119000	5123000	Third of all, you could do a trade-in program, offer cash for guns.
5123000	5124000	It's proven to work.
5124000	5126000	You know, get more guns off the streets.
5126000	5131000	And, I mean, a combination of those, you know, options and then ratcheting them up,
5131000	5132000	that would work.
5132000	5135000	It would just take a lot of separate programs, you know,
5135000	5138000	programs working independently and together, trying to make it happen.
5138000	5139000	And that's what's impossible.
5139000	5143000	Well, getting people to pass any of those legislative measures is impossible.
5143000	5144000	Yeah, no, I know.
5144000	5146000	I'm saying that's how you do it, not how it will be done.
5146000	5147000	No, that's good.
5147000	5148000	I mean, that's not...
5148000	5151000	If anything like that's going to happen, it's going to happen at a state level.
5151000	5152000	Yeah, sure.
5152000	5153000	And it'll be like, you know, I mean,
5153000	5157000	anyone who thinks that it's a good idea to vote for any of the people
5157000	5163000	in the GOP clown car have to only look at what Brownback did to Kansas,
5163000	5168000	which is like they're basically turned an American state into Somalia.
5168000	5172000	And they've just like created like this libertarian paradise for businesses
5172000	5175000	and then it's ruined the economy for every other person there.
5175000	5179000	Like it's easily like just all you have to do is look at the numbers
5179000	5182000	before Brownback was elected and after.
5182000	5184000	And you like you can't just you can't deny the data.
5184000	5188000	And in counties and places where there are more gun laws,
5188000	5189000	there's fewer gun deaths.
5189000	5193000	So if you could do it at a state level and then say like, you know,
5193000	5199000	it'd be great if it was California, then there's not as many gun deaths here.
5199000	5200000	This is working.
5200000	5205000	Then you start to put pressure on, you know, candidates to get it to go.
5205000	5209000	But you still have one entire half of the political environment
5209000	5213000	who refuses to accept that global warming is a thing.
5213000	5216000	I mean, like it's it isn't it's it's you know, like they're there.
5216000	5220000	If I was for looking at the moon, you know, they would be like,
5220000	5226000	well, we can't look at the moon anymore because lip tarts look at the moon.
5226000	5229000	Lip, lip tarts, lip tarts.
5229000	5231000	Oh, lip tarts. Oh, Jesus.
5231000	5233000	Yeah, it's it's one of the it's one of their more clever.
5233000	5234000	Lip tarts.
5234000	5237000	I went to you.
5237000	5240000	They suck, right?
5240000	5243000	Do you think that do you think the Internet has made it has made this
5243000	5248000	this this political like this by this this bunch of lip tarts out there?
5248000	5249000	Do you think we've become worse or better?
5249000	5250000	I guess we do.
5250000	5253000	I guess there's a question because we have so much now.
5253000	5256000	It's just like you just anonymous like like I can't watch out.
5256000	5259000	You can't watch a music video with the like underneath it.
5259000	5264000	It's just like people devolve into some crazy heated fucking like two party
5264000	5266000	culture war about something.
5266000	5267000	It doesn't necessarily be.
5267000	5269000	It's that there's like a gun control underneath a Madonna video.
5269000	5273000	But it's like if unless she has a gun in the video or like like Madonna was an
5273000	5280000	artist in the 80s and she was also an author did a great art book about naked
5280000	5281000	people called sex.
5281000	5282000	Yeah.
5282000	5285000	I wonder whatever happened to her.
5285000	5287000	But I guess it doesn't it doesn't matter.
5287000	5290000	It's like because there's just as many it's it's it's every every medium brings
5290000	5292000	like more good and more bad.
5292000	5294000	It's just fucking like I don't know what my point is.
5294000	5295000	We got to get out of here.
5295000	5297000	I got to get I got to get back to making a rocket ship.
5297000	5298000	We're going to get out of here.
5298000	5301000	I'm going to talk to Elon Musk and see if he can do us a solid.
5301000	5304000	So I'm tired of waiting for I can't I'm not going to come up with this shit.
5304000	5305000	Yeah.
5305000	5308000	They invited us from Geek and Sundry to go have a tour of the SpaceX facility.
5308000	5309000	Yeah.
5309000	5313000	So we're going like in like yeah we're going in like I think it's like a month
5313000	5316000	from now I get to go and actually why no right.
5316000	5319000	I'm very excited and go see the whole thing.
5319000	5323000	Steve told me that the Tesla has an Armageddon feature feature on it.
5323000	5324000	Yeah right.
5324000	5325000	Yeah.
5325000	5326000	Yeah.
5326000	5333000	It's something or an apocalypse button just in case you're in the apocalypse.
5333000	5336000	It what it does is it it makes the apocalypse happen.
5336000	5337000	No.
5337000	5339000	Why do we have that.
5339000	5344000	If there's a zombie apocalypse or if there's like a airborne virus and it's like killing
5344000	5345000	everybody off.
5345000	5350000	I don't know why this is in the car but you press the button and it pressurizes the cabin
5350000	5357000	of the car so that no air from the outside can get in and then it has a filter that filters
5357000	5360000	the air from the outside and cleans it so that you're safe.
5360000	5362000	It's like an underwater button.
5362000	5366000	It's just going to be great to be in a car with somebody on a road trip who's just farting
5366000	5367000	a lot.
5367000	5372000	It's going to be great to be in a car in a guy's Tesla when the world ends to that degree.
5372000	5376000	I'm sure you're going to like you're going to be alive for the next hour like like like
5376000	5378000	oh everyone but me can breathe.
5378000	5382000	Like you're not going to be like to look like people are going to be applauding and waving
5382000	5383000	at you.
5383000	5384000	Look at him.
5384000	5385000	He bought a Tesla.
5385000	5386000	Good for him.
5386000	5387000	My children are dying.
5387000	5390000	I'm not going to figure out if that glass can break.
5390000	5392000	I'm going to I'd feel terrible.
5392000	5395000	He seems he seems like he's had a rough life.
5395000	5398000	He'll be alive for the next 300 miles.
5398000	5399000	Yeah.
5399000	5400000	Unless there's no Internet.
5400000	5403000	Don't those cars not start if there's no Internet.
5403000	5407000	Don't they need to like check in with the Web site.
5407000	5408000	I don't know.
5408000	5409000	They may.
5409000	5410000	That's a myth.
5410000	5413000	I guess if it has an apocalypse mode someone check to see if it could start without the
5413000	5414000	Internet.
5414000	5417000	It's not like an electronic arts game.
5417000	5421000	It's like they're afraid you're going to copy the car.
5421000	5423000	So that's the thing.
5423000	5424000	Verify.
5424000	5427000	There's a root kid in my Tesla.
5427000	5429000	All right.
5429000	5432840	Well Amy Bergman there's one there's one other thing I would I would talk about which is
5432840	5435680	like this just this weird thing I noticed because I mean you've been around.
5435680	5443120	I've been your Twitter buddy for four years and what's that like.
5443120	5444120	Just ignore him.
5444120	5445120	It's illuminating.
5445120	5446120	I know you.
5446120	5451960	I know you're on his side tonight but I'm a good person too and what's it like to kind
5451960	5458720	of have your identity like like all of a sudden writers are not pretentious people like you
5458720	5463320	even less so than me like like I'm one of these assholes it's like my name's Dan Harmon
5463320	5464320	right there.
5464320	5468840	But but as a as unpretentious people all we have is our name and your name has always
5468840	5469840	been Amy Berg.
5469840	5470840	You were born Amy Berg.
5470840	5473280	The WGA has you registered as Amy Berg.
5473280	5475440	There's this director now.
5475440	5479120	She's not she's not she's not she's not out of kindergarten but she just started she just
5479120	5482800	joined the DGA and now her name is Amy Berg and she's just like Amy Berg.
5482800	5488080	I saw you on Twitter like going no I didn't I because she makes movies and it's like you're
5488080	5493840	like answering questions like well it would be awesome if all she did was win awards.
5493840	5500400	She tends to get into trouble a lot and and there's like you know like on you know the
5500400	5506400	top of like all these websites that like everyone who would ever employ me see like the name
5506400	5512240	like SAG-AFTRA won a file suit against Amy Berg and I'm like no it's not me you know
5512240	5513240	me.
5513240	5519840	Yeah she's she's a documentary director and she refuses to use her middle initial like
5519840	5523640	everyone else in the town does when they have you know someone else who has the same you
5523640	5528040	know like PT Anderson probably doesn't prefer to be called PT but he has to because there's
5528040	5534800	another Paul Anderson but she she's refused to and you know because she doesn't technically
5534800	5538160	have to because it's the DGA and I didn't I didn't even know I didn't even realize the
5538160	5542600	DGA and the WGA don't cross over like that it's just that they have been automatically
5542600	5547080	for 80 years like like no this is the first time anyone's just been like fuck it I don't
5547080	5552280	care which is I mean I don't want to throw her under the bus I don't know if she's a
5552280	5557120	good person or bad person but I'm like holy shit I'm sure she is a good person but I mean
5557120	5561640	the you know the it's problematic because like there's a tension that falls on me both
5561640	5566640	positive and negative that that you know kind of sucks and I it's not my responsibility
5566640	5571920	to tell the audience that that's not me that's her and you know it's just a pain in the
5571920	5579800	ass what it is what do we do is that you should have a boxing match new fighter should

5711240	5716280	proud of me like this is responsible of me I would be if we weren't contractually obligated

5723640	5729640	is your family I watched them on you know what playing mice and mystic mice what was it mouse and
5729640	5734120	mystic mice and mystics which seems like a interesting tabletop game was your wife seems
5734120	5740080	like like I saw I saw like from what I've seen it's like where did you meet her I met her because
5740080	5746040	what you're actually saying is she's way too no how did that happen no this is this is a thing
5746040	5751920	that I wrestle with all the time I don't I don't say was worse than that but that's not what I was
5751920	5760360	gonna say she you're a very very handsome luminary and an intellect I would I would assume that you
5760360	5767240	would have a wife that was like a I would I would I would not wish anything less for you than an
5767240	5778240	Amazonian statuesque princess with a body that never quits that's you just described my wife she
5778240	5789760	is she is the best part of being me and and and really she is no seriously and and I and I wrestle
5789760	5798120	with it all the time like I just I feel like I got like not that hard Dan he's making that personal
5798120	5806760	but but I yeah it's weird like I have imposter syndrome in like everything that I can do and I
5806760	5810880	like I don't understand how I like have somehow tricked her to stay with me for 20 years but it's
5810880	5816440	working she clearly like she's into those games she's not like yeah but you know what's interesting
5816440	5820320	is that she doesn't like doesn't like all the games that I like there's like some like really
5820320	5824960	strategic games that she is an example with she doesn't like Agricola she doesn't like Puerto Rico
5824960	5831520	she doesn't like power grid but she loves ticket to ride and she loves block us and she loves a
5831520	5837960	word whimsy and she really liked my some mystics even though she could not remember how many dice
5837960	5842240	she was supposed to roll and when she was supposed to roll them it's one of those weird things like
5842240	5846480	when you were talking about not remembering people's names I have the same problem and I've
5846480	5851360	there's people that I've known for a really long time but I know them situationally and I don't
5851360	5856520	know what their name is and now it's too late to go oh yeah I'm an asshole I've been like being
5856520	5861760	like hey man for like that guy that guy's been standing there behind that camera for 12 years
5861760	5867800	he's been and he's like he's always running that she runs the show like he's he's he's in
5867800	5873160	there running those cameras hey we haven't met what's your name I knew that I knew that okay see
5873160	5877480	there I just did hey Jillian thanks for thanks for standing there for 12 years so that's but
5877480	5882280	this is one of the great tricks that my wife does is I'll be like oh fuck I can't remember this
5882280	5886120	guy's name and sugar go hi man what's your name oh yeah like oh you got me you got it you got my
5886120	5891720	back I had a girlfriend that did that because like and then she but I still I was so I'd become so
5891720	5898440	good at masking like like I just have these like thing you know I just living in that life my whole
5898440	5902600	life so when I see people I'm just all I'm just kind of I'm not saying like I'm a it's just like
5902600	5907320	I'm just so used to it it's like hey oh yeah I'm like I kind of like just like talking if I think
5907320	5911480	you might be one of two people I kind of have I kind of have a conversation that kind of applies
5911480	5916680	to both people sure yeah this is and and so you get to a point on the dialogue tree where like they
5916680	5921960	have to make a choice exactly and I've there was a girlfriend who I explained this to and she had
5921960	5927080	heard the npr story and prosopagnosia or whatever it was and she was like oh that's a real thing
5927080	5932280	then that's cute I'll I'll help you out and I'll like and she would like always like do that that
5932280	5937480	thing but then one time I was like doing it so I was like talking to a guy at the editor award
5937480	5943560	who had a beard and a baseball cap and a tuxedo and glasses and it was like gee like like you
5943560	5949240	either edited the sarah silverman program or the community christmas episode I have no idea so I
5949240	5954120	just I talked in for 25 minutes about things that were true regardless of which person he was
5954120	5959240	that's incredible unfortunately things like I really enjoy working with you I really respect
5959240	5965320	you a lot which are all true for both people but also things that if 25 minutes later you find out
5965320	5970120	I don't know who you are you're gonna be really really bummed out because you're not gonna think
5970120	5975240	any of it was true um and and I did that the whole time and then my girlfriend who was listening
5975240	5980680	to the whole conversation um was just also convinced and so she was like I'm sorry what's
5980680	5985400	your name and and I'm sorry she didn't say that she's she's like Dan aren't you gonna introduce
5985400	5994440	us that's what she's like and and I was like ah and I just went this is Garrett and he went
5994440	6006520	oh no no no he had the way he said no no oh my god no man or whatever and I'm like I'm so sorry
6011480	6015320	he's like it's okay it's all right it's okay it's okay it's okay it's all right and he walked off
6015320	6019720	to win an editor's award or something and and and and it was like I'm just staring at the table my
6019720	6022920	girlfriend was like I was just sorry I'm so sorry I didn't I thought you knew him I'm like you're
6022920	6032360	supposed to think I know him that's what I'm good at dude I I have a worse story than that because I
6032360	6041400	have the herpes and she just drops the mic I'm out I have the unfortunate combination of having
6041400	6048280	a terrible memory and vapid overconfidence to where like you know I will I just think I know
6048280	6053960	I would just know I know someone and I once introduced someone to an ex-boyfriend by the
6053960	6060200	wrong ex-boyfriend um and he was like I need to parse that for a second yeah yeah you introduced
6060200	6066200	someone to an ex-boyfriend yeah I thought he was a different ex-boyfriend oh oh so I called him by
6066200	6074200	the wrong name and he said uh actually it's Matt we've slept together but you're but but you're
6074200	6077880	like I knew we slept together I just didn't know which I was not confused by that part

6263480	6270520	sounds kind of more positive than multiple aneurysm non-survivor but and yet carries with it uh uh
6271000	6277160	this life of uncertainty and and you you uh the last time we saw you you were finishing up various
6277160	6280200	projects but you had most importantly made this life decision where you weren't going to keep
6280200	6284520	doing these like medical things and we check in with you from time to time and what's what's
6284520	6290680	going on you talk instead of me all right cliff note version I'll try not to be too sad but um
6291880	6299160	so um I left the doctors I kind of went off on my own I still see a um one doctor uh you know
6299240	6305320	time time to get checkups I'm on my 12th aneurysm uh in my head right now and um
6306280	6311240	but for the most part I'm doing a little bit better I uh do you mean it's happening right now
6311240	6316520	I mean I think most of us I'll speak for myself like the word aneurysm sounds like explosion
6316520	6322840	which you mean you're on one yeah so it's in my head and they they put um coils in it and that's
6322840	6327800	to kind of deflate it uh so that the blood is that something that's happened since we last talked to
6327800	6332040	you uh yes oh okay so you're you're going to somebody that's seeing that's that's still
6332040	6337720	checking and able to see these things okay sorry um so to backtrack because uh the one thing I want
6337720	6342440	to talk about was a kickstarter project that you guys all helped me fund and how important it's
6342440	6349880	been to my progress um but to to get there real quickly um back before I started the project I was
6350920	6355800	um I was kind of told around 2013 when I first was in the hospital in 2010 that the
6356440	6359960	the some of the procedures I went through they don't know the long-term effects them because
6359960	6367640	they were new procedures so we weren't sure if I would survive past a couple years and so I think
6367640	6374920	subconsciously I was ready to go at any time so I did like the book soul star and then we put it
6374920	6379080	online and we you know we're trying to uh you know get out there try to raise money for the
6379080	6385640	aneurysm foundation the book didn't do well so then I faced like my first you know failure
6386680	6392680	and then as that kind of fed I I it started to where I was waking up like hey another day
6392680	6397320	you know another day's another gift and and then I guess like most people as you get older you get
6397320	6403320	jaded and cynical and I had to go from being essentially an infant when I had my aneurysm
6403320	6408360	for not talking and not walking and relearning all that and then in the span of three years
6408360	6414680	get back into a 32 year old's body so my life went hyper fast so once I hit that wall and things
6414680	6420920	were going slow reality really hit me and I wasn't really coping with things very well
6421560	6429080	so I tried to take my own life this this has happened you yeah you really made that effort
6429080	6434680	oh yeah I mean I'm not a good effort I just have I was on a lot of pills at the time so I just took
6434680	6440200	a bunch of them and then the shitty part was that I obviously it didn't work and the next day I woke
6440200	6444440	up really sick and my my stomach and chest were hurting and I didn't have the money to go to the
6444440	6452920	hospital so I had to just tough out some of the pain and then after that time is when I started
6452920	6458600	talking to my mom again and I figured well okay I now I know what the bottom looks like let's
6459480	6465400	let's try to build from that let's try to see where like where I can go so I started becoming
6465400	6469800	friends with my mom again which was nice and then I got to see her last Christmas you know
6469800	6474440	for the first time in a while and now she currently helps me hunt down Star Wars figures
6474440	6479160	from the new movie she's like she's at Walmart like I'm not Walmart you want one and that goes
6479160	6487640	for rednecks and she uh so so then what happened was I did this project that I honestly thought
6487640	6493480	no one would care about and then you guys all funded it in like a day and so I'm sorry I see
6493480	6498120	I've got I've just you guys I need to make get this clear like because the timeline of this is
6498120	6501880	were you just catching this up because when you've talked to us in the past you're like you had
6501880	6505720	reforges relationship with your mom are you talking about this suicide attempt this isn't
6505720	6510280	a thing that has happened that's new to listeners of our show it's new to listeners I mean it's not
6510280	6515000	I'm saying I haven't told it on the show right but it predates your reconciliation with your mom
6515000	6522360	and stuff like that it predates it was like last February yeah last February um sorry I just wanted
6522360	6526360	to make that clear just because people like you know they listen and they hear your story and they
6526360	6531960	want to check yeah no I'm glad I don't think linearly so it's great thank you um yeah you're
6531960	6540600	a fucking mess asshole get your fucking suicide right fucking when did it happen you you said
6540680	6543240	shit you would shrub and just fucking
6547000	6547400	sorry
6551240	6552440	so so
6554840	6555800	now he's good cop
6558120	6565160	now instead of it's instead of bad person it's his usual role that's okay Dan it's all right
6565160	6570200	so uh so so this project I wanted to do you know I lost a lot of the visual and creative side of
6570200	6574840	my brain I used to I moved out here to want to be a comic book artist when I first moved out here
6574840	6579080	and then I lost a good chunk of that um so I started you know but I still want to be a
6579080	6583960	storyteller so I started writing and I thought well what if I did an art book like what would
6583960	6588840	that look like what someone who can't doesn't know what an apple looks like unless he's looking at
6588840	6595400	one what does someone like that create and then as I was going through it um some of my visual
6595400	6600440	memory started to come back and then I started remembering like my life and then on top of the
6600440	6604920	worst part about that was that I could also remember things like dreams and I couldn't
6604920	6609720	differentiate what was a dream and what was what actually happened to me because all the visuals
6609720	6616440	were just coming like tidal wave after tidal wave um and so instead of letting that continue to
6616440	6621480	depress me what I did was I put it into the book so this book I created called Alon Vitale that you
6621480	6632280	guys all helped fund um thank you um it's uh it started off really small but then because you guys
6632280	6637240	funded it so quickly and we raised almost double what I intended I wanted to make it twice as
6637240	6642120	special and I wanted to make it a love letter to Harmon town and um and the people that come here
6642760	6648440	so um so the book is about a robot um who is struggling with emotions and uh
6649560	6656840	he at some point in his life um he started when a scientist gave him a soul and then he had to
6656840	6662040	struggle with the memories that came with that soul and then when it ends up happening as he
6663080	6669400	like all good robots will do he wiped out humanity and then uh and then but the thing
6669400	6676520	is he regrets it um he misses us and so so this book is his digital journal so there will be a
6676520	6681320	small print run but mostly it's a digital book so as you're going through the pages I do stuff like
6681320	6687160	surrealism purism um I took some tracks that Dustin Marshall made and I remixed them and made some
6687160	6695960	music um I also composed a song for it as well um I did a dance uh for for it um I basically tried
6695960	6700840	50 to 60 different art styles that are out there cooking you know things and I said you know if I
6700840	6706520	can't be a comic book artist what can what kind of artists can I be and so this book was my
6706520	6711640	exploration of that so so through these digital memories you go through the pages and you can
6711640	6717000	press the purism piece I did and it'll tell you the history of purism um and then you uh you can
6717000	6720920	manipulate things there's voice acting on each page that you can press and there's like you can
6720920	6725720	hear the characters talk um and then there's movies at play while you're watching it the
6725720	6731160	soundtrack plays while you're reading it so there's it's very interactive and and I thought um well
6731160	6735160	if I'm going to do something special if these guys everyone see something special in this then I
6735160	6740440	want to make it the most unique project so uh I'm proud to say that it's probably less than a month
6740440	6750520	from being completed finally um and uh and when it comes out when it uh I'm really looking forward
6750520	6755240	I've been I put if you want to see a preview I put 30 pages on the subreddit um which is about a third
6755240	6762360	of the book so um oh jeez seek that's terrible marketing that's what NBC did with every scene
6762360	6767400	with community that I gave them the thing is I dump it online I you know I I do some marketing
6767480	6772920	like for a comic book company and I um and I do some editing but uh the truth is I'm not a business
6772920	6778200	person I'm not a salesperson I just I just know how to take pieces of myself and share it with people
6781480	6789640	Trump Trump Trump Trump um the uh that sounds awesome that's fantastic news is that I mean
6789640	6794520	where where are you at personally like what is your so so what that has done for me is you know
6794520	6800200	when you when I thought about that I could check out any day now I'm at the point where I'm like
6800760	6807240	you know what I I have I have goals and I don't want to check out anymore um I I used to just be
6807240	6813640	ready to go at any moment and now I'm uh now you know I never had a five-year plan I never gave
6813640	6818680	love a chance because I just was like well what's the point if I'm just gonna go now I'm like no
6818680	6824120	I'm here so let's let's actually try to be you know human and let's try to do some of this stuff
6824120	6838680	as flawed as I may be and you were telling me backstage that uh you started experimenting
6838680	6846520	with racism uh and that that's really yeah yeah yeah see you applaud and then he turns out to be
6846520	6854120	racist I'm sorry New Zealand I'm sorry how amazing would that be if you're like and then
6854120	6858040	I started my dreams became my memories and then I remember then I remembered oh my god I hate black
6858040	6864440	people actually I must I must hate white people because of all the things I've written since
6864440	6870760	soul star everyone says where are your white characters I go I think I hate them that's I
6870760	6876120	yeah that's that's the only good kind of white person you can be I that's that's the only choice
6876120	6880680	I could make like I don't I'm I'm I have to be racist so I'm going to assume all white people
6880680	6888040	are racist that's my racism uh it's called soul star oh yeah that's on amazon it's a it's a
6888040	6893800	superhero book okay um alan vital is this book okay um just want to make sure that got out there
6893800	6899080	oh thank you yeah uh yeah alan vital is called it's based on a french theory uh philosopher that
6899640	6905320	he thought you could transfer the human soul into an inanimate object so the book's very meta
6905320	6910840	uh I I not only is the robot you know does he have a soul transferred into him but he actually
6910840	6916520	has my soul so in it in the book you're reading he has my memories so you actually see me go from
6916520	6921800	the hospital to where I am now in the book through his memories and then also this is
6921800	6927000	me transferring my soul into this book so why did he wipe out humanity if he got your soul
6927640	6932840	does he does he hate is there there's an anger we've established he's a racist
6934120	6940520	he's just racist against humans I mean is it like yeah well what I what I've noticed is what
6940520	6944840	you guys were talking about earlier gun control like I'm on obviously your side with it I I hate
6944840	6951400	anything that takes human life and uh and I hate that number one thing humans yeah and I and I hate
6951400	6956600	that there's even a debate about it to me it's it's that's insanity and I know why obviously I
6956600	6961720	know money's involved in everything and people in power but uh so I thought you know what would I
6961720	6968600	do how would I save the world and so alan you know uh he he just he he doesn't want to kill
6968600	6972680	anyone I would never want to kill anyone so he releases an airborne virus that renders everyone
6972680	6979400	sterile um and so so this this generation of humanity is the last generation oh that's what
6979400	6985480	I do yeah yeah that seems that is except now what you've done is you've you've forced natural
6985480	6991640	selection to leave only people who can afford teslas to breed well actually he um before I
6991640	6994760	actually mentioned that in the book he shuts that he shuts down the power to all the teslas
6996600	7002120	but all those chambers smart yeah he all those chambers that air seal you in he shuts them all
7002120	7008040	down before he does it yeah because yeah clever robot yeah oh I like that idea making everyone
7008360	7013960	yeah I mean that would be that'd be nice I so hot
7015960	7020120	you know what would be sad so hot is if you could if you could render them not only sterile but
7020120	7024440	also kind of sexless so that they could this would be tragic but also beautiful that they
7024440	7029000	could spend the last their last generation of humanity could actually give you some hope for
7029000	7033560	humanity because everybody'd be like well I don't have like fucking like all these like
7033560	7039240	because don't you think like hormones are like like what he does is he yeah I mean there is a
7039240	7043240	I don't want to spoil the ending but there's I definitely touch on things like that towards the
7043240	7048440	end of the story I'm just trying to make it yeah because I just I around my 42nd birthday I was
7048440	7053960	like I don't really want to jerk off anymore and then I see those commercials with a guy catches a
7053960	7062040	football and goes like hey I'm coach Johnson uh my dick stopped working but my pharmacist said I
7062040	7068280	could get dick dickula um now and then he throws the football really hard and he like you watches
7068280	7074200	it you watch it go into it like a pussy and like why would they put a pussy and use a football
7075400	7079960	it's not even clever and he's like coach coach your football back in a pussy with dickula
7080600	7085880	like dickula that doesn't sound like a pill sounds like it sounds like dracula it does coach
7085880	7092600	johnson coach johnson it's a terrible commercial but the point is the same I'm like I don't want I
7092600	7096280	saw the commercial and I'm like I don't yeah but this is these are the best days of my life yeah
7096280	7101480	I'm like friends with women these are salad days like I'm not I'm not I feel like I'm a better
7101480	7107080	person since they became kind of like more like a fucking yeah I don't call you anymore because
7107080	7121880	you know why dick doesn't work what the fuck are you what are you saying yeah yeah my dick
