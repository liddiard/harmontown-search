190620	196060	All right, all right, come on, knock it off. All right. Welcome to Harbontown, everybody. Thanks.
196060	203020	Jeff Davis, Rob Trump, Spencer, uh, I don't have- I- I-
203020	209420	This is the second to last Harbontown? Yeah. I feel like I had a- I must have had a dream that I wrote something.
209420	212940	Did you ever- I'll be right back. Did you ever have a podcast and this happened to you?
214620	220220	That guy's gonna take a shit. That guy is going to take a shit.
220220	222940	That body language is only like, I have to take a shit.
222940	229100	When somebody goes, oh no, I'll be right back, runs that way, going to take a shit.
229100	231500	Yeah, that's the Del Taco traps right there.
234460	239660	Yeah. I want to know all about it when he gets back. Oh shit. Ah, boom.
240620	245020	Oh, he was- he- we don't have Steve Levy tonight, so he's on vodka patrol.
245660	248940	He didn't have to take a shit. That would have never came out otherwise.
249900	251420	What? Your shit? No one would- yeah.
253180	255980	I have to fetch vodka every time I take a shit. Oh.
257260	262300	Yeah, I don't have any notes. I- I swear though, I think it just is- we're- we're- we're- we're in
262300	266860	the last leg of the podcast. I think it's important to note, I must have had a dream that I
267580	272300	wrote down a note. Classic. Because I remember today, I was like, well, I got that one note that
272300	277820	I wrote, right? And that was like, in the dream, I was like, I gotta talk about this in the podcast.
277820	284780	In my dream, I thumbed a note into my notes app and was like, gotta talk about that. And I-
284780	290860	it was in a dream. The reality is, this show is not worth coming to.
292700	298940	That's the reality. But I- in my dreams, it was. I dream about it. It's affecting me.
298940	301740	I wrote a note that I was eating a giant marshmallow.
301740	303020	All right, well, that's- Jeff.
303020	310300	I always have dreams where it's like, the dream is just me standing in my room and I pull out my
310300	314700	wallet and I place five dollars into my wallet and I put it back in my pocket. And then I'm like,
314700	319740	that wasn't a dream. I must have five dollars. And nope. That's like, wait, that was the podcast
319740	324220	equivalent. That's what you did. What are the ratio of dreams you have that are like, uh,
324220	330060	because we have dreams where you wake up from the dream and you're- for a second, you're like,
330060	334380	that's real. And then you're like, oh, that's not real. What do you think the ratio is when
334380	341180	that's good and bad? Five percent. Oh, because sometimes it's good. So this is bad, right?
341180	345660	Like sometimes you find a ratio and then you're like, I found 50 dollars while you were giving
345660	354220	like, I didn't find no 50 dollars. I'd say it's almost always bad. I, I, I feel like in the last
354220	359580	couple of years, every time that's happened to me, it's been exclusively good. Like,
359580	363740	and maybe that's a privilege thing, like, cause I've excelled to a point where I'm like,
364300	370300	my dreams are now just about like, my car's got a flat tire. And then I wake up. I'm like,
370300	377020	no, it doesn't. I had a dream where I was throwing up metal spaghetti. I had another dream where all
377020	381740	my teeth were falling out. One tooth fell out. Then the other two fell out. Yeah, I know. And
381740	386620	I was, and the whole, the whole bottom row of my teeth just cracked off in one piece,
386620	391900	like a Dracula dentures. And then I was like, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to
391900	395180	me. And then I was like telling people about it. And I was like, wait a second. I could talk
395180	399580	perfectly. This is a dream. Oh, great. This is a dream. My teeth are fine. And then I woke up.
400540	403260	But how many dreams have you, can you remember a dream where you,
403260	406220	it was a great thing that was happening. And then you woke up and you're like,
406860	410380	I can't wait to get out of bed because that thing happened. No, it didn't.
410380	413020	Yeah. One time I dreamed that I bought Pokemon blue.
413740	419660	Pokemon blue. I had a dream that Kyle McLaughlin was a good friend of mine.
421740	427100	And like, and I was like, because I met him at like this party and I was like, oh man,
427100	432460	I can't wait. And I'm really getting along. He's like listening to me and laughing at all my jokes.
432460	437740	I'm like, I can't wait to go home and tell Kate. Hey, yeah, someone listen to me.
437900	447820	Yeah. It was a dream. And then I woke up and then I was like, I don't know, no Kyle McLaughlin.
449180	454860	I got all bummed out. When I was a little kid, I had a dream that I could fly and I was running
454860	461660	around in my like driveway and it was like, we had a basketball hoop and I had a dream that if I
462620	467660	just wanted to, I could fly like in like, not like like Superman, like waiting in the sky,
467660	472780	but I could just kind of hover around and just fly like 20 feet off the ground. It was this awesome
472780	478460	liberating dream. And I woke up, went out into the driveway and jumped in the air and believed
478460	484780	I could fly. And I guess what? Couldn't fly. Damn. I could fly my dreams, but I have to
484780	491420	flap my arms really hard. Did you ever dream that you could do that and then your arm extended?
491500	495100	Like, uh, like plastic man. No, like, uh, space jam.
497420	503100	Cause I mean, it obviously brought me to R Kelly when you said that I believe I can fly. You
503100	509340	literally believed you could fly and I was young and naive enough to think that, oh, all you have
509340	514060	to do is will yourself to fly. I mean, that's amazing that you were young enough that you
514060	519740	retained that dream belief enough that you got out of bed and ran out there. The moment I woke
519740	525340	up, I went right out to where the dream took place and in the driveway. And I just, I thought
525340	531740	like, just jump and believe in yourself, like believe you can do it. And I jumped up and went
531740	538060	smack on the, on the gravel. And I thought, okay, that was a dream that this is a harsh awakening
538060	543100	about the sadness of humanity. All life is sorrow. I think the nice thing about our species,
543100	549100	I think the key to our victory and inevitably to our demise, obviously we're all dying
549100	557020	because of our success. It's a double edged sword. It's like humanity. You did it. You're
557020	562620	the most populous mammal on the planet. Therefore game over you're dead. Um, or you're going to
562620	567660	become matrix people. And in either case, win, win for insects. I think jellyfish and lobsters
567660	572780	fucking won the battle on, but I think the romantic thing about our species is as pointed
572780	579020	out in Yanov, Smirnoff, whatever that guy's name is, uh, no, no. No, whatever the Yanov
579020	583260	Smirnoff, the big guy, the guy, the guy I'm always quoting his anthropology book that I,
583260	591740	the Homo Deus, uh, guy, uh, it's like our dreams at Homo sapiens, our dreams are louder than reality.
591740	596380	Like we can convince ourselves of shit and we just, we're just like fucking, yeah, I should
596380	600860	major in journalism. That's a fucking, yeah, I've never looked it up. I'm going to be a journalism
600860	605660	major. I believe in journalism. And then you can go to college for a semester and be like
605660	610060	journalism isn't real. And then you drop out and you're like, what am I going to do? And then
610060	614060	people would be like, why would you do that? Why wouldn't you look up journalism? Well, because I
614060	621020	thought I believed in it. I wonder how many, how many journalist lobsters there are. All right. Well,
621020	627020	let's bring up our, can we quickly, just really quick in the news, you hear about the cyber truck.
627020	632860	Do you have any thoughts on cyber truck? What's your, what's your temperature on cyber truck?
632860	636460	I love it. You guys are going to talk shit about my best friend Elon Musk.
636460	641420	No, I'm just wondering. I love it. I love the cyber truck. The only thing I don't love about
641420	653020	the cyber truck, coming to your town, it's a cyber truck. It's got straight lines instead of curvature.
653020	661180	It's a cyber truck. It's a deal maker for sure. Um, I got one problem with the cyber truck.
661180	666700	One. It's for poor people. It's, it's like, uh, clearly like the, the clean lines and other
666700	671980	things. It's like, Oh, it's not for poor people. It's meant to protect rich people from the
671980	677420	apocalypse. But not from throwing a brick at the window. No, it's meant to, no, it's got a really
677420	681820	sensible price point. No, I know. But it's, it's, it's meant for when the world ends and you have
681820	685900	to like go between your billionaire compounds. So you could like just drive over people with
685900	691740	spears or whatever. Aesthetically, that's what it, that's what it presents. But the, in reality,
691740	698060	what it is is a, he's eliminated the, the big port because he caught so much shit for like,
698060	703100	I'm going to make my own car. And it's like part of why it's hard to make a car is because engineers
703100	707900	will tell you, yeah, you know what? You make humans feel safer by adding like these weird
707900	713260	Roman arches to the architecture, which don't add to the safety of the car. But if you just make
713260	717980	those straight lines, he can make those cars even faster. They're cheaper. That truck's going to be
717980	722380	cheap. That's what I read. That's what I read in Wired magazine. It is, it's not super expensive.
722380	727100	Speaking of Wired magazine, we're going to, let's bring out our guests. I brought these guys down
727100	731340	from San Francisco because we're, we're in the final leg of our podcast. There's no rhyme or
731340	736540	reason to it except that I love them. And then the history of the show, like of the, the amazing
736540	741340	decade that we've spent together. I, one of the highlights was my ability to reach across the
741340	748700	world and having read a book and say like, Hey, come down and make a new friend. And I just wanted
748700	756460	these guys to be here for the, for the end times and, and, and chat with us. And is that a good
756460	762140	introduction, Dan? I don't know. Let's bring out. Please welcome New York Times bestselling author,
762140	766940	Cyber truck. What Steve Silverman and Keith Carrick.
779100	785020	I had a dream that I was on the second to last Harman town. That was so heavy. That dream is
785020	789660	now a reality. Thank you for running Neurotribes, which everyone should go read.
790220	796940	We were talking in the green room about diagnosis, self-diagnosis, diagnosis of others.
798700	803660	We were getting into me. You were like, has your mind changed about anything? Where's like,
803660	809820	I had to clarify just so everyone knows I never diagnosed myself with autism ever. Right. Right.
809820	816060	And what I was talking about was with some autistic people online and they were claiming
816060	820300	that you had diagnosed yourself with autism. And I said, well, I don't, you know, I don't know
820300	825260	about that. I don't think so. But whatever Dan is, he's certainly neuro. He's fucking weird, right?
827020	833100	He's a weird guy. That was the important thing about your book. The fucking weird guy.
834220	839020	Yeah. But the whole, it's strange, right? Yeah. But the whole thing is that it's the
839020	844620	fucking weird people that keep society moving forward and not get stuck in boring shit.
844620	853660	Okay, fine. Steve, like you probably, you don't, you don't think you're qualified or
853660	857740	anybody's really qualified to diagnose other people. But looking back through history,
857740	862460	we could probably diagnose certain people probably with certain qualities. Yeah. Well,
862460	866940	the people who were retro-diagnosed, as they say in my book, the historical figures, they were
866940	872300	diagnosed by people with actual qualifications to do so. Right. Yeah. So I would never. But looking
872380	881500	at Dan, just look at him, just to pick somebody at random. Yeah. Yeah. What is wrong with him?
882780	890540	Can you help us? Well, we were talking about ADD before, which seems right to me, but,
890540	895180	you know, I'm certainly not qualified to diagnose anybody, but one gets a feeling, you know,
895180	900300	I resonated a lot with the ADHD books that I've read slash listened to because who wants to fucking
900300	907980	read these pieces of shit? I got better things to do. God damn it. Right. But the beauty is,
907980	913580	if you have ADHD or whatever the fuck you have or don't have, like, what are the odds that science
913580	917900	has come up with ways to compartmentalize all of us? The important thing about your book is that
917900	923980	key phrase, neurodiversity. It is the idea of like, Hey, it takes a million kinds of brain
924540	931980	to make a great society and that America, not to get jingoistic, but it's like, because it's probably
931980	937820	only through, through our, like we just didn't know how to stomp it out. But like,
938860	945020	like we created a country where if you can build it and it's worth money, like you're, you are,
945020	950460	you now go from being maybe the village idiot or the village geek or the village pervert to being
950460	956700	like the village counts the village, you know, and the, the, if you read neuro tribes, it's like,
956700	963420	there's a part of it that is like the history of America as it's, it's undiagnosable relationship
963420	970780	with autism and how always the people on the fringe have been creating new ways for us normies
970780	975740	to communicate with each other. And us normies have messed up the world so badly that it might
975740	983180	take somebody like Greta Thunberg, whose autism gives her the ability to not give a fuck about
983180	989980	the lying, whoever's that is the, that, that, that's the, that's the cycle is, is someone who's like
989980	996060	geeky and like draws fire, stepping out front and going like, look, I don't, I don't, I don't know
996860	1001500	how you people are approaching this, but in my mind, here's how I approach it. And then
1002460	1006700	you, yeah, we put them out there, we burn them at the stake and then over the charcoals,
1006700	1012700	we roast our marshmallows and then we start partying. Anyways, Keith, thank you for coming
1012700	1019020	out too. Thanks for having me. I, I literally since the invite have been just contemplating
1019020	1027100	the entire audience going, huh, who is that guy? Keith is Steve's husband as of 2003. And, uh,
1027100	1036540	like, uh, that's our newer divergence. Yes, exactly. Also you own 60, 80, how many bow ties
1036540	1042380	Keith? 60, 60 ish. Yeah. Yeah. He's one of the few people that actually knows how to tie a bow tie.
1042380	1048300	And I find that awesome. He's also a chemistry teacher. So it's sort of a middle, middle school
1048300	1053340	chemistry. No, I, I moved up to high school. Oh, really? Yeah. I did middle school for 10 years,
1053340	1058220	but is that how it works? Our high school chemistry teachers, like, they're like,
1058220	1063100	I finally know more about chemistry now. I've, I've watched middle schoolers deal with, oh,
1063100	1069740	that's what potassium is. No, it's, it's more the, uh, crowd control. The middle school crowd
1069740	1075420	control was definitely bootcamp and then high school you can handle it. And so they're like,
1075420	1083020	yeah, that's a profound statement. I assume public school? No. No. Okay. No. Heavens no.
1083020	1088780	Quite not. Yeah. But it really is based on that idea that kids are animals. I mean, like,
1088780	1093820	and as they grow into adolescence, they increasingly become capable of putting
1093820	1098700	your head through a chalkboard. Indeed. Well, well, thanks for that thought.
1100220	1105100	Do they still have chalkboards? Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
1106380	1112220	But do you have a preference, uh, on chalkboard versus dry erase? Oh my God. So we actually,
1112220	1120860	Chuck, uh, white for Chuck. So I had white chalkboards. Mostly I've recently had to start using
1120860	1126060	whiteboard. I hate it. Right. I definitely prefer chalkboard. It freaks me out too.
1126060	1130940	Does the smell get you high? No, it's just the, those markers last about a week. Yeah.
1132940	1139340	Chuck is durable. You can see from a stick of chalk, how much chalk is left. Exactly. Yes.
1139340	1145180	Exactly. And you could go to war with China and lose. And like, if there's a little chalk
1145180	1149420	left, you could be like, I know that's going to make a lot. And like, you could come into
1149420	1153260	Rick and Morty a week later and be like, all right, anyways, this story is really important.
1153260	1162860	God fucking cock it. You can also. God fucking cock it. You can do that without going to war
1162860	1171900	with China too. What's your fucking beef with China? Yeah. You can go to war with China.
1171900	1176540	Lay it on the line, Dan. This is part of the reason I'm ending the podcast because
1177980	1181980	there's going to come a time when you're either pro China or anti China. And I'm not,
1181980	1191500	I'm not in it for that man. Look, free Hong Kong. So Keith, Keith, you're saying you're,
1191500	1196380	you're a guy in the wool chalkboard, old school slate and chalk, dude. Yeah. I like that.
1196380	1200380	Absolutely. But he's, but he still gets to blow shit up, which is the fun part.
1200380	1205740	You get a, okay. Well, that's, well, yeah, just, you know, make stuff.
1205740	1210300	So is there, do you have any observations like you've been, how long have you been teaching?
1210300	1215980	Uh, 20 years now. So you've got, you're in a prime position to make any observations. I know
1215980	1223820	teachers always like, like, like give us any generational observations. Uh, well, so one thing,
1224540	1231580	uh, wow, I, I'm really, I'm really not that deep. Um, one thing I will tell you that a lot of people
1231580	1239180	don't know, unless you work in a school is that teachers emotionally devolve to the level of the
1239180	1247180	students that they teach. So like elementary school teachers, how they get upset is different
1247180	1251980	from middle school. Even including in the teacher's lounge when they're like, who took my Nilla wafers?
1251980	1257980	Yeah, exactly. They like, yeah. So basically I just am perpetually 15 now
1259340	1264060	and just sullen and withdrawn. Where do you mean perpetually 12? So now, yeah, exactly. So I'm
1264060	1268940	moving up in the world. But Keith, Keith, are you being honest? Like you, like you, that's actually
1268940	1274380	just a thing that you do to adapt and to be able to deal with them. Yeah. You just spend your whole
1274380	1280700	day with people the same age. I couldn't imagine hanging out with a bunch of 15 year old me's.
1281260	1288460	Like I was a, just a prick. I haven't changed all that much, but I was just, so yeah, on the record,
1288460	1296940	my students are great. Yeah. And if any of them are listening to this, you gotta hate one of them.
1302700	1309660	Don't have a favorite class section. No, they're all my favorite. Do you have, do you have a way
1309660	1314860	of handling, do you have a way of handling the class clown or the guy that heckles you or the
1314940	1321580	girl? Like whatever, some student is the most disruptive. That's actually me. I'm the class
1321580	1325340	clown in my class. Isn't it true that you're supposed to, on the first day of class, find the
1325340	1334860	biggest student and beat him up? That's what I've heard. Just fucking sharpen up a toothbrush,
1334860	1340540	sharpen the edge of a toothbrush and just shank him. Otherwise you get a full two semesters.
1340540	1348140	You're on the menu. I think my favorite teacher in high school was my chemistry teacher. I thought
1348140	1353740	she was the one that I connected with the most because I thought chemistry, it's so weird,
1354380	1362300	like the idea of like, the idea of like protons and electrons and like fucking chemicals and
1362300	1371660	reacting with each other. It's so, it's complicated. You summed it up so well there.
1373900	1380700	That's my whole year class. It just all sounds like magic. And then you have a person trying
1380700	1386700	to explain magic to you the whole time. It's pretty fascinating. Yeah, no, it's a lot of fun.
1386700	1395580	I'm a biology guy myself, but you don't like it. You consider that. Biology is just like a weird
1395580	1405420	theater play built on the set that I am responsible for. Now, okay. Here's a real question for you.
1405420	1409980	I want to know about, as a teacher, now you've done middle school and now you've done high school,
1409980	1415660	like I do want to know when you're standing in front of a class and try to be honest about it,
1415660	1424700	and I do trust you. You've had dinner together and I always wonder about high school teachers,
1427020	1433580	how much of your brain is occupied by that idea of you're a performer and like I'm killing,
1433580	1440780	I'm dying, I'm losing them, I'm getting them back. Yeah, a lot. And how much does that drive
1440780	1447420	what you're doing? Because I would think, if I were a teacher, that's why I'm not a teacher,
1447420	1452540	because I would be like, okay guys, two plus two equals, and I hear a yawn, I'm like equals party.
1453740	1458780	And that's not true. It doesn't equal that. No. But I would teach them that because I'd be like,
1458780	1465980	don't kill me. Yeah, no, it's, well, I, so when I was a kid, I loved doing theater. So I do feel,
1465980	1470220	and then, but then I also fell in love with science and studied science. So I do feel like it's sort
1471020	1474780	of a bit of acting and a bit of science. So you have that awareness that you're like, you know,
1474780	1481340	who am I presenting as? Like, I need to be a character that they can trust. Yeah. Well, I feel
1481340	1485020	like when I think about it, I feel like I'm definitely myself in front of my classroom.
1485020	1492620	I'm really open to my kids. I try to be really honest about a lot of stuff. But I do feel like
1492620	1499740	I sort of put on a character when I get to school every morning a little bit. I'm a lot more outgoing
1499740	1508780	and humorous there. Then you're going to find out that I am tonight. I feel like the bow tie
1508780	1514940	is part of that, but yeah, absolutely. Like, like I, because I'm thinking of running a simulation of
1514940	1521260	my high school self and like imagining myself being in your class and my first thought, like
1521260	1526780	just looking at you before without knowing you at all, I would be like, don't fuck with this guy.
1527340	1532460	Oh God. No, no. My, I don't think I've ever taught a student who thought that about me.
1533020	1538140	Well, I guess, but I don't mean don't fuck with him because he can kick my ass. I mean,
1538140	1545660	don't get on this guy's bad side because he's actually like, he's hardcore OG nerd. And like,
1545660	1553580	he is going to pay huge dividends if you're like, if you give him a minimal amount of attention
1553580	1560300	and he's got, and he will leave you behind with the smart kids. If you, if you fuck around,
1561900	1565420	that's a version of, of hierarchy that I would recognize.
1565420	1572140	Keith gets really nice letters years later, even from students who thought his class was too hard
1572140	1578140	or whatever. Like, uh, it makes you cry sometimes to get really nice. I cry about a lot of things.
1578140	1584380	That's true. I think in an American modern society about the bow tie, Tucker Carlson,
1584380	1592220	not with style, that the bow tie is sort of like, Hey, you know what? Like, uh, formal,
1593020	1600300	but only in a, in a, in the sense that I had to be Keith. I can't put my finger on it.
1601260	1605260	Can you tie? Cause you say you wear them all the time, right? Yeah. I wear one every day.
1605260	1607820	Do you do it without looking or do you have, do you have, do you have a mirror?
1607820	1612940	I can't do it with looking. I have terrible, uh, spatial reasoning left and right gets mixed up.
1612940	1616940	So if I try to look in a mirror and do it, I strangle myself.
1617500	1621020	Would it be, would it be a bullshit thing for me to ask for you to untie or to bow tie?
1624540	1628940	I have to have a mirror to tell a lot of people have never seen a bow tie be tied,
1628940	1634780	including I'm speaking for myself. I should use my eye statements. I have never seen a bow tie be
1634780	1641020	tied. All right. Well, I'm so glad I could be here to do this thing. Um, I will say a couple of
1641020	1650780	great things about bow ties over neck ties. Can't, can't spill on it. Oh, okay. Okay. No,
1650860	1666140	all right. Nevermind. I'm so not going to be able to do this. Okay. I'm like, I'm like,
1666140	1670780	I'm seriously shaking. Oh, well that made it worse.
1673260	1678460	This is, these people came from all over the world to watch you tie your bow tie.
1681660	1697260	Tie tie, tie tie, tie, tie tie, tie, tie, tie, tie.
1699420	1700280	Yeah, baby,
1702300	1709660	Bear, bear, bear.
1709660	1720660	I would say if you were ever dying in class, just untie your tie and do that and tell them all to sit down.
1720660	1724660	I think, Keith, that was the most show-busy thing that's ever happened on our show.
1724660	1726660	Yeah, that's awesome.
1726660	1731660	And that's why I married him too, because can you imagine? That dexterity put to other uses.
1731660	1733660	Oh!
1733660	1734660	Uh-oh.
1734660	1737660	Whoo!
1737660	1740660	I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but that sounds sexy.
1740660	1741660	One second.
1741660	1747660	The English major's interpretation of the...
1747660	1749660	I'll get it later.
1749660	1756660	I hope you guys don't mind sharing the stage with maybe some pilgrims tonight, because the show is ending,
1756660	1764660	and so the audience is like packed with people who have come, like they've flung themselves from all four corners of the earth.
1765660	1768660	How many people came from another country tonight?
1768660	1769660	Yeah.
1769660	1770660	That's crazy.
1770660	1771660	Too many people.
1771660	1774660	How many people came from like a long way away in the U.S. or Canada?
1774660	1775660	Yeah.
1775660	1776660	Yeah.
1776660	1778660	That's a bit more believable.
1778660	1781660	How many people wore red tonight?
1783660	1786660	How many people can tie a bow tie without looking?
1786660	1788660	Oh, see, they're lying.
1788660	1791660	But the first person that comes to mind that I met at the drawing room,
1791660	1794660	which I got in my car from the Rick and Morty office,
1794660	1797660	and I literally hit the wrong button on my Tesla screen,
1797660	1801660	and I ended up going to what was my old home,
1801660	1804660	which is a couple blocks from the drawing room,
1804660	1808660	and so I went into the drawing room for the first time in like six months,
1808660	1810660	and it was just filled with...
1810660	1812660	I'm going to call it neurodiversity.
1814660	1816660	And proudly so.
1816660	1819660	And really passionate people,
1819660	1823660	people just thanking me for doing the podcast,
1823660	1825660	being so respectful and amazing.
1825660	1827660	And one of the most inspiring things, by the way,
1827660	1829660	not to get off on a tangent,
1829660	1831660	but was actually the drawing room regulars,
1831660	1832660	the people that...
1832660	1834660	My social anxiety was like,
1834660	1838660	fuck, these people must hate me for fucking being a magnet
1838660	1841660	for outside interlopers and all these things.
1841660	1845660	But some of the more working class elements of them
1845660	1848660	were because they talked to you guys,
1848660	1851660	like they were at the end, they were going like,
1851660	1855660	hey man, I talked to those people,
1855660	1861660	and the shit they say about you, fucking cheers, man.
1861660	1865660	That's you guys, you're nice.
1865660	1869660	You sold me to these guys who...
1869660	1870660	Fuck them.
1870660	1872660	They're not here.
1872660	1874660	But anyways, thank you.
1874660	1877660	And every single Harmontown fan,
1877660	1881660	as a matter of tradition, their introduction is always,
1881660	1884660	I'm so sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you.
1884660	1887660	I'm doing this to you, but my name is so-and-so.
1887660	1892660	They come in so low, you almost want to punch them,
1892660	1895660	but you don't because you understand
1895660	1897660	that it's exactly what I would do.
1897660	1899660	That's exactly how I would feel.
1899660	1901660	And so many of you came up to me tonight.
1901660	1903660	One of you in particular came up to me
1903660	1906660	in the middle of my conversation with someone else
1906660	1909660	and just said, I'd like to talk to you about autism.
1909660	1911660	That was your introduction.
1911660	1913660	And I said to that person,
1913660	1915660	do you know who the guest is tonight?
1915660	1916660	No.
1916660	1918660	It's Steve Silberman.
1918660	1920660	And they were like, oh my God.
1920660	1923660	Well, let me tell you this.
1923660	1926660	Being Steve Silberman, I have a lot of autistic friends.
1926660	1931660	And they thank you so much, particularly for Abed,
1931660	1935660	because it gave them a person
1935660	1939660	who they could really relate to in visible media.
1939660	1941660	I wrote a character based on my friend,
1941660	1943660	almost punching down-ish.
1943660	1946660	I was like, hey, my funny friend.
1946660	1950660	And then because I was narcissistic
1950660	1953660	and hadn't been abused enough by online,
1953660	1957660	I was constantly googling myself in my show.
1957660	1961660	And what I saw was this new thing
1961660	1963660	called the autistic community saying,
1963660	1965660	we love this Abed character.
1965660	1970660	And because of greed and selfishness
1970660	1974660	and desire to do a good job by these people,
1974660	1976660	I was like, what do they mean?
1976660	1977660	Why do they like him?
1977660	1980660	And they would say, he doesn't have Pinocchio syndrome.
1980660	1982660	They would say all these things.
1982660	1985660	And it was like, oh my God, what is this thing?
1985660	1986660	What's Pinocchio syndrome?
1986660	1989660	Well, it's just this idea that if you're the data
1989660	1992660	character on Star Trek, if you're like these characters.
1992660	1993660	I want to be a real boy.
1993660	1994660	Yeah, oh God.
1994660	1996660	It would be, if only I could give someone a hug,
1996660	1999660	then I'd be the greatest person ever.
1999660	2003660	And it's like, I don't mean to...
2003660	2005660	Put down hugs?
2005660	2010660	Well, I don't mean, if that is someone's journey,
2010660	2015660	I don't mean to diminish that.
2015660	2016660	Oh, thank you.
2016660	2020660	But there is a very, very large community of people
2020660	2023660	that are like, actually, this doesn't feel that much
2023660	2025660	like a disability.
2025660	2028660	I'm constantly watching you people give each other hugs
2028660	2031660	and then run away crying from each other.
2031660	2033660	It kind of all comes out in the wash.
2033660	2037660	I basically am behind this piece of plexiglass,
2037660	2040660	which sometimes is an inconvenience, but overall
2040660	2042660	seems to avoid a lot of trouble.
2042660	2044660	I seem to be much more efficacious at my job.
2044660	2047660	I don't understand why you people feel sorry for me
2047660	2049660	and want to cure me of this plexiglass
2049660	2051660	that seems a little stupid.
2051660	2053660	And so they get a little annoyed.
2053660	2056660	They see a character in a show that's kind of resonating
2056660	2058660	with them because they're like, I'm a robot,
2058660	2061660	or I'm a puppet, or I'm a wooden clock,
2061660	2063660	or I'm a fucking flying carpet.
2063660	2065660	I'm looking at the carpet.
2065660	2067660	There's no such thing as a flying carpet.
2067660	2070660	That's like an autism thing.
2070660	2071660	You guys saw Aladdin.
2071660	2074660	That carpet's autistic.
2074660	2078660	It'll take you anywhere, but it doesn't care.
2078660	2081660	But I would watch them and they would go like,
2081660	2084660	I love Abed because he doesn't have Pinocchio syndrome.
2084660	2085660	He doesn't do this.
2085660	2086660	He doesn't do that.
2086660	2089660	And I was like, I want these people on my side.
2089660	2091660	I want to do right by them.
2091660	2094660	And then I took tests online because I
2094660	2100660	wanted to learn the details of I wanted to send them signals.
2100660	2101660	I'm on your side.
2101660	2104660	I want to be like, if you were writing Sons of Anarchy,
2104660	2107660	let me take a test about motorcycles.
2107660	2110660	Oh, my handbrake gives me skin burns or whatever.
2110660	2111660	I'm like, whatever.
2111660	2113660	Give me fucking money, cha-ching.
2113660	2117660	I was only doing it through greed and narcissism.
2117660	2119660	I like this community.
2119660	2122660	I want your approval.
2122660	2125660	Well, I went through the same thing while writing Neurotribes,
2125660	2128660	because I started writing about autism as a science writer for Wired.
2128660	2132660	But as soon as I did a bunch of research going all the way back through
2132660	2135660	the Holocaust and everything, I realized I like these people.
2135660	2138660	These people are on a journey towards autonomy.
2138660	2140660	These are the people that created America.
2140660	2141660	Right, exactly.
2141660	2143660	A journey towards autonomy?
2143660	2144660	You said?
2144660	2145660	Yes.
2145660	2146660	Explain that to me.
2146660	2149660	What I mean is autistic adults for most of the 20th century
2149660	2151660	were like living and dying in institutions.
2151660	2155660	And everybody was talking about autism behind their backs.
2155660	2157660	So I was like, whoa, what causes autism?
2157660	2160660	Believe it or not, most autistic people don't wake up in the morning
2160660	2162660	and say, I wonder what caused my autism.
2162660	2166660	You know, they think about how they can have fun or how they can have friends
2166660	2169660	or how they can fall in love or how they can get a job or et cetera.
2169660	2174660	And so I wanted to send them signals in my book that I was on their side too.
2174660	2179660	And so that's why my book sort of took off with the blessing of the autistic
2179660	2181660	community for which I'm very, very grateful.
2181660	2182660	Yeah.
2182660	2183660	I listened to that.
2183660	2184660	I was super successful in that regard.
2184660	2185660	Yeah.
2185660	2186660	And there are...
2186660	2187660	Anyways.
2187660	2191660	But sorry, like I was describing this person who came up and said,
2191660	2192660	I want to talk about autism.
2192660	2195660	And she literally did not know that you were the guest tonight.
2195660	2199660	And so I would be remiss of the guy think that we should bring her up.
2199660	2200660	Yes.
2200660	2204660	I spoke to her before you did because I was at the drawing room earlier.
2204660	2208660	And she said like, I think it was her first episode where you were the guest
2208660	2210660	and like, yeah, we have to bring her up.
2210660	2213660	I don't want to put too much pressure on her, but I also don't want her to live
2213660	2216660	the rest of her life going like, I wanted to talk to him about autism
2216660	2218660	and then the autism guy was on the show, whatever.
2218660	2220660	So is it Jessica, right?
2220660	2221660	Jennifer.
2221660	2222660	Jennifer.
2222660	2223660	Jennifer is very close.
2223660	2224660	Carrasquillo.
2224660	2225660	All right.
2225660	2226660	Jennifer Carrasquillo.
2226660	2227660	All right.
2227660	2231660	But really, Jessica, you go by Jessica mostly.
2231660	2232660	Whoa.
2232660	2233660	Awesome.
2238660	2244660	Thank you, Rob.
2244660	2248660	Nice, nice like James Bond kind of tuck and roll on the stage.
2248660	2249660	That was very good.
2249660	2251660	That was a Tobias Yunkay.
2255660	2256660	All right.
2256660	2258660	Let's let's talk about autism.
2258660	2259660	Okay.
2259660	2260660	No pressure.
2260660	2263660	Jennifer, first off, you were a behavior specialist.
2263660	2265660	What was it again?
2265660	2266660	Yeah.
2266660	2267660	Use your microphone.
2267660	2268660	What you said.
2268660	2269660	Yeah.
2269660	2270660	What you said.
2270660	2272660	Say it like the way that you know how to say it better than I do.
2272660	2275660	I'm a behavior specialist.
2275660	2276660	Yeah.
2276660	2278660	Whoo.
2278660	2279660	What does that mean?
2279660	2283660	Like you work for companies, corporations, and you deal with people.
2283660	2285660	Like break it down for me.
2285660	2287660	I specialize in autism.
2287660	2289660	I direct all the autism.
2289660	2290660	I'm an autism director.
2290660	2291660	Just use the mic like a dog.
2291660	2294660	Who are the people who you work with usually?
2294660	2295660	No.
2299660	2300660	Use your microphone.
2300660	2305660	I work primarily with children on the autism spectrum from the ages of
2305660	2310660	zero to 11 or 11 21.
2310660	2315660	And I mean, it's at the services are pretty broad.
2315660	2320660	I mean, it's it's education.
2320660	2321660	Yeah.
2321660	2322660	I don't know.
2323660	2326660	If you can make a wish that would make the world better for the people you
2326660	2328660	work with, what would it be?
2328660	2329660	Oh, that's a really good question.
2329660	2330660	That's a great question.
2330660	2333660	That's a phenomenal question.
2333660	2336660	That's why I love him.
2336660	2338660	Oh my God.
2338660	2342660	It would really be about like creating not really so much like the
2342660	2347660	contrived environment from the ages of, you know, the educational ages,
2347660	2352660	but like beyond that and figuring out where they fit in, where people fit
2352660	2355660	into society because I think they're just, I don't know.
2355660	2359660	There's just like so many expectations of us.
2359660	2363660	We all kind of have to like fit into this different.
2365660	2367660	Actually, no, you were going to a good place.
2367660	2371660	I mean, there's there's there's like, I feel like we're all kind of like
2371660	2376660	channeled into these very like specific ways that we go and
2377660	2385660	it's sometimes the people that have have the ability to contribute the most.
2385660	2389660	These different areas are just kind of overlooked.
2389660	2394660	And that's the cool thing about autism and services like what we do is as we
2394660	2397660	make sure that they don't get overlooked and we can make sure that, you know,
2397660	2401660	these people that have like these incredible contributions to make to
2401660	2404660	to everything I have have a voice.
2404660	2405660	So that's awesome.
2406660	2407660	Excellent.
2410660	2415660	That's like a big theme of your book is the idea that the idea of accepting
2415660	2418660	neurodiversity and therefore the way a society could react.
2418660	2423660	It's like it's like basically building like it's going.
2423660	2429660	Oh, don't we all recognize that all of our brains are like these crazy fireworks
2430660	2436660	and therefore wouldn't an ideal society allow for even the most fringe kind of
2438660	2444660	conduits between the weirdest places of thought up into where they can provide
2444660	2445660	people with.
2445660	2446660	That's true.
2446660	2450660	And I think I think a lot of times stuff like art and comedy and science has
2450660	2453660	been sort of unofficial channels of that information.
2453660	2454660	That's yes.
2454660	2455660	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2455660	2456660	Yeah.
2456660	2459660	I mean all the arts, the sciences, depending on how broad you want to go.
2459660	2462660	It's like it's weird people going, can you hear me?
2462660	2463660	David Lynch.
2463660	2464660	Hello.
2464660	2465660	Right.
2465660	2466660	Exactly.
2466660	2467660	I mean, diagnose him.
2467660	2468660	Right.
2468660	2473660	It's like David Lynch is I was like not a fan until somebody said he's
2473660	2474660	autistic.
2474660	2475660	I'm like, I'm a fan.
2476660	2480660	Because then I look back at every David Lynch film that I was like, come on
2480660	2481660	already.
2481660	2485660	And then I was like, oh, he's banging on a pipe and going like, hello.
2485660	2486660	It's me, David Lynch.
2486660	2488660	Can you hear me?
2488660	2492660	Or for that matter, David Byrne, who's a show American utopia.
2492660	2494660	I like talking heads finally.
2494660	2495660	Yeah.
2495660	2499660	And, you know, when I, the first time I saw him was in 1977.
2499660	2500660	I'm really old.
2500660	2501660	Okay.
2501660	2502660	Boomer.
2502660	2504660	Oh, Dan Oberlin.
2504660	2508660	And the first time I saw him, I thought, why is that guy so nervous?
2508660	2509660	He's so nervous.
2509660	2511660	David Byrne is autistic.
2511660	2512660	He's so nervous.
2512660	2513660	Yeah.
2513660	2516660	He's autistic, which he taught, or he has Asperger syndrome, which he
2516660	2517660	talks about now.
2517660	2522660	But the amazing thing about American utopia is totally uplifting, totally
2522660	2523660	beautiful.
2523660	2526660	Everybody playing music while they're dancing on stage.
2526660	2531660	Uh, the antidote to a lot of what's going on in this country right now.
2531660	2539660	Um, it was, it was a very human humanizing show and that's coming from
2539660	2541660	somebody with a neurodivergent mind.
2541660	2542660	Yeah.
2542660	2545660	I think you do a weird, uncomfortable place because I think the last
2545660	2548660	time that we talked, maybe I was having dinner with you in San Francisco
2548660	2549660	with Cody.
2549660	2550660	Yeah.
2550660	2553660	Um, but, and I think maybe the election had just happened.
2553660	2557660	And so we were like hippies in San Francisco going like, okay, I guess
2557660	2558660	the world's ending now.
2558660	2559660	Right.
2559660	2560660	And it did, by the way.
2560660	2561660	It did.
2561660	2571660	But like now, like, I guess I, I, I, something that I have perceived as
2571660	2580660	a tragedy is that whereas in the past neurodiversity built the internet,
2580660	2584660	neurodiversity like gave us everything that we were using swipe left,
2584660	2585660	swipe right.
2585660	2587660	Like who comes up with that?
2587660	2590660	Like the answer is, and like, where are we all?
2590660	2592660	We're all moving in that direction.
2592660	2598660	Like now that the infrastructure has been in place and like all of society
2598660	2602660	is on the internet to the point where your presidents are chosen by the
2602660	2603660	internet.
2603660	2608660	My biggest frustration is my brothers on the spectrum.
2608660	2610660	And I don't mean I'm not diagnosing myself.
2610660	2617660	I'm saying my people, my, my neurodivergent people by virtue of their
2617660	2623660	Han Solo mentality, they're like, I don't fucking like think like anybody.
2623660	2630660	Like that those folks are now, whereas in the past they were the builders of, of,
2630660	2638660	of what we have now, they are simply sitting online and they were, they, they're
2638660	2641660	now, I, I watch them.
2641660	2647660	The only way they can express their neurodivergence is by going, oh,
2647660	2650660	I was a butter emails.
2650660	2651660	Yeah.
2651660	2658660	I feel like, like, like, I'm like, I'm like, dude, you're, you don't like,
2658660	2661660	like, am I wrong about that?
2661660	2666660	Well, I mean, there are always a lot of people watching television, you know,
2666660	2669660	but yeah, I mean, I know what you mean.
2669660	2672660	I'm not going to, I'm not going to take part in this system.
2672660	2673660	Like, oh yeah.
2673660	2674660	Yeah.
2674660	2675660	That classically, yeah.
2675660	2676660	Your psychology has not taken part in any system.
2676660	2679660	For now, the definition of not taking part in a system has now become part of
2679660	2681660	this fucking death star.
2681660	2682660	Yeah.
2682660	2684660	And I'm like, oh no, oh, I was 25 once.
2684660	2685660	Oh fuck.
2685660	2688660	And I just like recede to my swimming pool.
2688660	2689660	I don't know.
2689660	2690660	No, I know.
2690660	2694660	Well, you know, in the early days of Wired, when we were all in this one huge
2694660	2698660	room with dub music playing and Rudy was high and had hickens on their necks.
2698660	2699660	Yeah.
2699660	2704660	We thought the internet was going to absolutely unleash human creativity.
2704660	2707660	And unfortunately what it unleashed was Russian propaganda.
2707660	2709660	We thought that the internet was like bound.
2709660	2713660	Everybody assumed that almost in a shameful way.
2713660	2718660	I think we were all like, God damn, when's the government going to catch on to the
2718660	2725660	fact that once someone in Saudi Arabia can just sell you jewelry in Montana,
2725660	2729660	that everything, racism's going to stop.
2729660	2731660	Like, everything's going to stop.
2731660	2736660	Like, it's going to pull the plug on everything that's been driving human
2736660	2738660	like jingoism.
2738660	2741660	And I was like, it was the opposite.
2741660	2742660	It was the opposite.
2742660	2743660	Yeah.
2743660	2746660	We were like, oh, the internet made us more racist.
2746660	2747660	Wow.
2747660	2749660	Well, not us, but yes.
2749660	2750660	People.
2750660	2751660	People.
2751660	2752660	People.
2752660	2753660	Do you feel more racist?
2753660	2754660	I don't know.
2754660	2755660	It's certainly, you know what?
2755660	2757660	It's made me a bigger fucking dick.
2757660	2758660	Yeah, me too.
2758660	2759660	It's made me more hateful.
2759660	2760660	Absolutely.
2760660	2761660	It's made me more divisive.
2761660	2765660	It's made me go, there are good people and there are bad people.
2765660	2767660	I never felt that way before.
2767660	2768660	Yeah.
2768660	2769660	I agree with you.
2769660	2770660	It's made me a worse Buddhist.
2770660	2775660	Because I have regular sort of tire iron fantasies involving certain...
2775660	2777660	Jennifer, can I ask you a question?
2777660	2779660	We spoke earlier.
2779660	2783660	You and like over the last like few weeks when people were kind of coming to
2783660	2787660	Harmontown because it's going to close soon.
2787660	2791660	We meet a lot of people that talk about like why they listen to our weird,
2791660	2793660	unprepared, stupid show.
2793660	2795660	And it means a lot to...
2795660	2797660	It means different things to different people.
2797660	2800660	What makes you as someone that does what you do?
2800660	2803660	Like what draws you to it?
2803660	2805660	And what made you come out to go see it?
2805660	2808660	Because a lot of people came from like far and wide to come tonight,
2808660	2811660	which is really, really cool and kind of blows my mind.
2811660	2820660	Like what is it for you personally that this did or does or didn't do?
2820660	2823660	Like what's your connection to this?
2823660	2827660	I just don't really have a lot of personal connections overall.
2827660	2828660	So it's...
2828660	2831660	Boo! Unacceptable!
2831660	2833660	I just ruin everything.
2833660	2834660	I'm just going to leave.
2834660	2836660	What's wrong with you?
2836660	2839660	So it's cool to just...
2839660	2843660	Yeah, it's cool to just like kind of get up and be able to say whatever I have to say.
2843660	2848660	And nobody really connects that to who I am or anything like that.
2848660	2849660	It's just...
2849660	2850660	I don't know.
2850660	2851660	This...
2851660	2853660	You can just be who you are.
2853660	2856660	It's this existential sort of thing where you can be wherever.
2856660	2857660	And it's great.
2857660	2860660	And you can do that with this whole Harmontown thing
2860660	2863660	because Harmontown doesn't have a location and just is.
2863660	2866660	So it's kind of a community and...
2866660	2868660	God, that sounds so dumb.
2868660	2870660	No, it's good.
2870660	2871660	But it's cool.
2871660	2874660	It's a community and that's what...
2874660	2876660	That's what I like about it.
2876660	2879660	I mean...
2879660	2883660	So, yeah, that's it.
2883660	2884660	I like the D&D.
2884660	2889660	You came from...
2889660	2890660	Yeah, I like the D&D too.
2890660	2891660	That's cool.
2891660	2892660	Oh, no, no, I didn't.
2892660	2893660	I wasn't trying that.
2893660	2895660	But you came all the way from Pennsylvania.
2895660	2898660	We've met people that came from Vancouver.
2898660	2899660	Japan?
2899660	2900660	Japan.
2900660	2901660	Texas, England.
2901660	2905660	The Japan...
2905660	2909660	Can we keep the carousel moving and can we thank Jen and...
2909660	2911660	Thank you, Jennifer.
2911660	2912660	Thank you.
2912660	2915660	I'm not good at dismissing people.
2915660	2916660	But it's...
2916660	2918660	We got to cavalcade here.
2918660	2919660	Thank you, Jennifer.
2919660	2920660	That was awesome.
2920660	2921660	I didn't have...
2921660	2922660	Yeah.
2922660	2924660	Yay.
2924660	2927660	There were other people.
2927660	2928660	Awesome.
2928660	2929660	Who came...
2929660	2931660	Someone actually came from Japan?
2931660	2932660	Right over here.
2932660	2933660	Whoa.
2933660	2935660	That doesn't sound Japanese at all.
2935660	2937660	Like, it sounds like he's from...
2937660	2939660	It sounds like Canoga Park.
2939660	2942660	It is me, but I'm not the person from Japan.
2942660	2944660	It's Ashlyn, right?
2944660	2945660	Yeah.
2945660	2946660	Ashlyn, you want to come up?
2946660	2948660	Ashlyn, bring it up.
2952660	2953660	Oh, wow.
2953660	2954660	A little kimono.
2954660	2955660	I love it.
2955660	2956660	Wow.
2956660	2957660	Yeah.
2957660	2958660	Excellent.
2958660	2959660	Hello.
2959660	2960660	Yo.
2960660	2962660	There you are.
2962660	2963660	Holy smoke.
2963660	2965660	I mean, for our non...
2965660	2968660	Like, video listeners, this is a great kimono.
2968660	2969660	It's the full rig.
2969660	2970660	Yeah.
2970660	2971660	Yeah.
2971660	2974660	With a rear-facing kabuki face.
2974660	2977660	Actually, this is a no mask, which is a...
2977660	2981660	No is like the predecessor of kabuki theater.
2981660	2984660	It's a classical Japanese form of theater.
2984660	2985660	It's almost intertwined.
2985660	2986660	Like, it's almost like a...
2986660	2990660	Like, Shintoism is the indigenous religion there.
2990660	2992660	It's animistic, and it's kind of like a...
2992660	2995660	It's almost like a religious ceremony as much as it is a performance.
2995660	2996660	It's really boring.
2996660	3000660	Wait, so are you visiting from Japan, or were you visiting Japan?
3000660	3001660	No, I lived there.
3001660	3002660	Okay.
3002660	3003660	Where do you live?
3003660	3005660	I live outside of Osaka.
3005660	3006660	Oh, nice.
3006660	3007660	Yeah.
3007660	3008660	I've been there for 11 years.
3008660	3010660	I went there for a grad school, and...
3010660	3012660	Are you fluent in Japanese?
3012660	3013660	Hi.
3013660	3016660	That means yes.
3016660	3017660	Wait.
3017660	3020660	I knew that one.
3020660	3022660	Can I ask you a question?
3022660	3023660	Yeah, of course.
3023660	3036660	What's your favorite really weird Japanese food that you can't get here?
3037660	3038660	Mice.
3038660	3039660	Okay.
3039660	3040660	It's called...
3040660	3042660	Not to perpetuate a stereotype.
3042660	3050660	It's called Shirako, and it's like fish's testicles, but they're inside the fish, so it's like...
3050660	3051660	Yeah.
3051660	3052660	Yeah.
3052660	3055660	And you can eat them raw, or you can eat them cooked, and they're really tasty.
3055660	3056660	Shirako.
3056660	3058660	Can't get them here.
3058660	3059660	Oyasuminasai.
3059660	3060660	Oyasuminasai.
3060660	3063660	Fish have testicles?
3063660	3064660	They're inside the body, yeah.
3064660	3065660	What the fuck?
3065660	3070660	That's why I'm not a life scientist.
3070660	3071660	I'm a physical scientist.
3071660	3074660	I don't want to know nothing about that.
3074660	3076660	I would avoid that subject.
3076660	3078660	How does the stuff get out?
3078660	3079660	No, I won't.
3079660	3081660	I mean, yeah.
3081660	3085660	Lots of roe, or eggs as well, or tasty kazunoko.
3085660	3088660	Herring roe is another favorite of mine.
3088660	3090660	What is the thing on the back called?
3090660	3092660	The little pouchy business on the back?
3092660	3093660	Yeah, it's a little...
3093660	3096660	I have always wondered, what is the purpose of this?
3096660	3098660	Because you can't exactly put things in it.
3098660	3103660	So this is taiko, or drum obi, but the obi is this long piece of material
3103660	3106660	that you have to expertly...
3106660	3107660	It's like the sand.
3107660	3108660	Yeah, weave around yourself.
3108660	3112660	And so, yeah, what is the purpose of this thing?
3112660	3113660	I've often thought...
3113660	3118660	I think it's to make you sit straight or something.
3118660	3119660	Interesting.
3119660	3120660	It kind of looks cool.
3120660	3128660	So the thing about Japanese kimono is the whole thing is you need straight lines.
3128660	3136660	And I think that speaks to the body type of the people who develop this tradition.
3136660	3139660	So in Europe, you have the...
3139660	3143660	I don't even know what era this would be, like Baroque, but Victorian maybe.
3143660	3147660	Just tight waist and voluptuous curves.
3147660	3151660	That's the total opposite of what you're going for with kimono.
3151660	3154660	So I actually have to...
3154660	3156660	I mean, I don't have big breasts, so that's not a problem.
3156660	3158660	But I've put...
3158660	3163660	They have a special pad that you put on your back and wrap your waist with a towel
3163660	3166660	so that this line is straight.
3166660	3168660	You just want straight lines.
3168660	3169660	Straight lines.
3169660	3170660	Everything is straight.
3170660	3172660	I love those.
3172660	3173660	Some of my favorite lines are straight.
3173660	3178660	If anything's curvy, that's actually like a...
3178660	3179660	Well, it's just not the style.
3179660	3180660	Yeah, I don't know.
3180660	3185660	Well, they don't really have curves so much as maybe Europeans.
3185660	3187660	I'm chipping out on the face and the back of your face.
3187660	3188660	I know.
3188660	3189660	Why am I too?
3189660	3191660	You're kind of never of duty.
3191660	3192660	Yeah, I know.
3192660	3195660	Is the word kimono...
3195660	3196660	Kimono.
3196660	3200660	Is that referencing a whole style or just the garment?
3200660	3201660	Kimono.
3201660	3204660	Kimono means wear and mono means thing.
3204660	3206660	So it's just things you wear.
3206660	3207660	So it is like a...
3207660	3208660	It's a style.
3208660	3210660	It's like Lakosa Nostra, this thing of ours.
3210660	3211660	It's just garments.
3211660	3213660	It's just garments, yeah.
3213660	3216660	But I mean, it is a certain style of garment.
3216660	3221660	Now, do you rock a kimono just around town or is this a special event?
3221660	3222660	Sometimes.
3222660	3223660	Well, this...
3223660	3224660	I mean, this is special.
3224660	3226660	But yeah, I do wear kimono sometimes around town.
3227660	3231660	So you're visiting from Japan and you're going back home soon?
3231660	3232660	Yeah, in a week.
3232660	3234660	Home is Osaka for you or outside of Osaka?
3234660	3235660	Yes.
3235660	3236660	That's awesome.
3236660	3237660	Yeah, I came here.
3237660	3243660	Okay, so you came up to me at the drawing room and you gave me a folded piece of paper
3243660	3245660	and you said there's a story.
3245660	3246660	Origami.
3246660	3248660	Well, I would...
3248660	3249660	No, I know.
3249660	3250660	I know.
3250660	3251660	I know.
3251660	3252660	I know.
3252660	3253660	I know.
3253660	3254660	I do origami.
3254660	3255660	I know that's just...
3255660	3257660	I made a floor.
3257660	3259660	A tatami.
3259660	3260660	Or a wall.
3260660	3261660	So that was just...
3261660	3262660	A tatami.
3262660	3264660	That was a copy that I brought to my own.
3264660	3265660	You said you had a story.
3265660	3266660	What?
3266660	3267660	Yes, I have a story to tell.
3267660	3268660	I got no applause.
3268660	3272660	You whipped that out with such style.
3272660	3278660	So this is a story of why I came here and what Harmontown means to me.
3278660	3284660	I want to read part of it, but to set it up...
3284660	3285660	Keep you cool.
3285660	3286660	For camera.
3286660	3287660	Yeah.
3287660	3288660	It's better if you set it.
3288660	3289660	No, I'm good.
3289660	3290660	I kind of want to act out part of it.
3290660	3293660	I was proud of my tie about a half hour ago.
3293660	3296660	You've done fantastic.
3296660	3301660	I'm gonna, like, lavish you.
3301660	3306660	I'll bring you down, but bring you back up in the end.
3306660	3311660	So I was really depressed.
3311660	3316660	Like, this was only a couple of months ago, maybe two and a half or so.
3316660	3320660	And, yeah, it was over the course of six months that it just got worse and worse, and then,
3320660	3322660	like, I downward spiraled at the end there, and I couldn't...
3322660	3325660	I mean, I just didn't want to be awake.
3325660	3330660	And I was listening to this podcast, like, just waking up and listening to it just to...
3330660	3332660	That was my lifeline.
3332660	3335660	So that's the context.
3335660	3340660	Well, actually, okay.
3340660	3345660	Leading up to that, I named you Will Drostin.
3345660	3348660	Is that okay?
3348660	3351660	Will Drostin.
3351660	3354660	To protect my identity.
3359660	3361660	Oh, man.
3361660	3364660	Or you're going from here to Doug Benson's podcast.
3364660	3369660	You're like, I named you Will Drostin, and he's like, that's great, I'm high.
3369660	3374660	And then you're off to Joe Rogan, and you're like, I named you Will Drostin, and he's like, have you tried DMT?
3377660	3385660	I found Will Drostin on Hey Ho Kool-Aid, which is also a made-up name of a podcast that...
3386660	3389660	Welcome, baby.
3389660	3393660	Glad you are with the Dunkin' Truss family.
3393660	3395660	I had never heard of him before.
3395660	3396660	Excuse me.
3396660	3400660	I started the episode in the car after dropping my friend off on the opposite side of the city.
3400660	3408660	I was fumbling with the controls while getting lost in a maze of basket-woven overpasses and tunnels, trying to rewind.
3408660	3414660	I had to concentrate to follow what he was saying, and it wasn't because he was intentionally obfuscating
3414660	3418660	to trick his interlocutors into assuming he is intellectually superior.
3418660	3424660	Lots of people would call him a creative genius, a term that gets bandied about, especially in Hollywood.
3424660	3433660	Some people hate his guts, but I can't imagine that gets to him, he who describes himself as a fat, stupid piece of shit.
3433660	3435660	Maybe he is.
3435660	3451660	A nerd, an entertainer, a solipsist, a pariah, an exemplar of redemption, a pariah once more and once more redeemed,
3451660	3459660	endlessly cycling along the curved quadrants of a four-act narrative whose structure he believes is so deeply etched into our cognitive apparatuses,
3459660	3465660	his tongue-in-cheek cameo on an episode of The Simpsons depict him drawing this circle on a whiteboard.
3465660	3471660	He doesn't claim to have discovered it, only to have successfully harnessed it to make a lot of money.
3471660	3480660	His was a particularly delicious swirl of intricately webbed thoughts spun through articulatory prowess,
3480660	3484660	and above all, an unabashed, unadulterated self-loathing.
3484660	3490660	He didn't try to gloss over his twistedness, his fetishes, his alcohol and drug consumption, or ironically, his shame.
3490660	3496660	He knew where his faults lie, and rather than deny them, he called them out in the loudest voice possible.
3496660	3500660	It felt so good to watch someone do that. It was healing.
3500660	3506660	I listened to that podcast like Medicine, skating the razor's edge of self-righteousness and masochistic humility.
3507660	3509660	I loved how they played on stage.
3509660	3516660	I want friends to play with like the, I thought, a drift in an ocean of empty beer cans and unwashed dishes.
3518660	3522660	Oh, it's not done! Wait, it's not done.
3523660	3542660	So, I had this dream where I met you, and we were partners, not necessarily in a romantic way.
3542660	3545660	Business partners. We don't get pizza placed together.
3545660	3553660	We're friends, and at the end of our misadventures, we end up on opposite sides of the street,
3553660	3558660	or like in our own houses on opposite sides of the street, and we're talking on the landline,
3558660	3563660	and you've got a bunch of like creatures and characters in the room with you, and I'm alone over here,
3563660	3572660	but we're laughing and joking, and I look out the window and notice that you've left your suitcase on the front porch with the door wide open.
3572660	3577660	And so, I tried to like weave that into our banter, but it didn't track, so I said,
3577660	3582660	I'm going to come over and tell you a secret, and you were like, oh my God!
3582660	3588660	And so, you came outside, and you were kind of surprised when I just walked past you,
3588660	3596660	maybe like ruffled your hair, put the suitcase inside, closed the door, and I walked back over to you and...
3596660	3601660	Chapter three.
3601660	3615660	I kissed the top of your head, and at that moment, I am instantly and utterly overwhelmed by the most intense feelings of gratitude,
3615660	3620660	compassion, love in its myriad forms, the entire fucking universe.
3620660	3625660	Boom! A bolt of lightning cracks, and I wake up.
3625660	3636660	There's a thunderstorm passing outside, tears stream down my face as I blissfully bathe in the sensory Epsom salts of having been seen, been held and understood.
3636660	3641660	I lie there for a few moments, the bath bubbles are popping, the tub water is draining.
3641660	3648660	I move to get up, but something gently urges, just enjoy these moments, they will be over soon enough.
3649660	3660660	I sit on the edge of my bed, open the door, and listen to the rain, still awash with the feeling of having spent intimate time with someone whom I adore and admire, but were strangers, right?
3660660	3666660	What was that bolt of lightning? What about the rising sun streaming perfectly through that embrasure?
3666660	3670660	What about that repeated topic of conversation? What about that stranger?
3670660	3675660	Why are you connecting dots if there is no benevolent force assigning them ordered numbers?
3675660	3682660	How can these be assembled to form a picture in a universe that doesn't deign to move you in any particular direction?
3682660	3695660	What hit next collided with another bolt of lightning that cracked so loud and near my window that I jumped up and turned around, heart pounding, half expecting someone to walk through the door.
3696660	3708660	The benevolent force is you. It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you.
3708660	3716660	If you choose benevolence, you are the engine of the force field that is blasting through the architecture of your consciousness and all of its contents.
3716660	3721660	You are God.
3721660	3726660	All right.
3726660	3735660	Thank you, Ashlyn. Absolutely beautiful. Ashlyn, everybody. Yeah, that's incredible.
3735660	3738660	Thank you so much.
3738660	3745660	I mean, you don't like we started doing this podcast like you don't like like remember Adam Goldberg.
3745660	3751660	Yeah, it sounds like he's here like the first if you say his name three times, he'll be he'll appear on stage.
3751660	3761660	The first thing was like, do you is this a safe place? And if it is, do you do you bully anybody? Do you do you shut anybody out?
3761660	3773660	And that was such gorgeous prose. And I could go on about how it's it's it should not be applied to me, but that's not what's important.
3773660	3785660	The prose kind of included that the O rings were in place there like like she she was able to create like an expression of like, oh, this rubber ring could connect to anybody really.
3785660	3790660	Or that's you know, that's so flattering. So beautiful.
3790660	3797660	What blows my mind is like that people like for some reason over how long, seven years we've been doing this?
3797660	3806660	No, I think I've got around a million. I and paste dot com magazine dot org dot edu.
3806660	3815660	Somebody somebody said we're one of the top 10 podcasts of the decade, which I didn't realize was like we're nearing the end of a decade.
3815660	3820660	Top 30. One of the top 30.
3820660	3824660	I was gonna say, I wish. Don't get me wrong.
3824660	3829660	It's a millennial. We were like number 21 out of 30, I think. All right, fine.
3829660	3836660	I thought it was somebody. I guess somebody polished that knob for me before we might have been in the top 10.
3836660	3849660	I mean, it's like over the last couple of days, like people have been coming, like, you know, like strange pilgrimage to the drawing room to come, like, say hi and go to the show and meet up with other Hermiton fans.
3849660	3855660	And it's it's really crazy. Like, like you guys came from everywhere. It's it's amazing.
3855660	3859660	Has anybody not been to Los Angeles before tonight?
3859660	3868660	I think most of the most. That's awesome. I mean, Sarah and Austin, you guys are from Chico.
3868660	3874660	My dad went there for school. There's a what?
3874660	3881660	Jennifer, Pennsylvania, Samson Riley from where? Where's OK. Well, what's your name from Vancouver?
3881660	3886660	What's your name, buddy, from Vancouver? Samson and Riley. Danny from Vancouver.
3886660	3894660	Oh, shit. Because I met him at the drawing room and he bring it up.
3895660	3908660	What he what he said, Danny from Vancouver. Danny, not to put a lot of pressure on you, but what you said was you've been working on a Dan Harmon impression that was.
3908660	3917660	Oh, yeah. That was that was one word long and you had it about 30 percent of the way.
3917660	3920660	Yeah. And I was like, all right, come up and share it.
3920660	3926660	Yeah, it's a sound and a word. Sorry to expand upon what I promised you.
3926660	3931660	There's a bait and switch. I feel comfortable. I'll go.
3931660	3942660	As we near the end of me being a public figure, I'm like, honestly, I would have loved to have seen a lot more impressions of me from the James Adomians of the world.
3942660	3946660	Like, I've I've solicited it. So whatever you can give me, I love it.
3946660	3950660	Yeah, I tried. My friend Samson put me on your podcast about nine months ago.
3950660	3959660	I started binge listening and there was just one word that I picked up on that I thought quintessentialized Dan Harmon.
3959660	3964660	And maybe I could possibly imitate you on. So I need Jeff's help.
3964660	3972660	I just need you to end sort of non sequitur, an irritating story that Dan would find.
3972660	3979660	It's just something that, you know, whether you mean fucking or just anything sort of like end of the end of a story.
3979660	3993660	And then I'll. Yeah. And the major D turned to me and said, thank you.
3993660	3998660	All right.
3998660	4002660	Danny from Vancouver.
4002660	4010660	Danny, everybody.
4010660	4018660	You better get out of here, Danny. All right. Thank you. Give it up for Danny, everybody.
4018660	4021660	Thanks, man.
4021660	4027660	He made Rob go crazy.
4027660	4034660	Do you know what I realized tonight? Rob Schwab is the Rudy Giuliani of the Harmon Chad administration.
4034660	4038660	That's exactly what he has. It's like friend or foe. We don't know.
4038660	4046660	It's like, I don't know. Lately, if you watch like Seth Meyers impression of Rudy Giuliani, it's like like that.
4046660	4052660	Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, you don't like that. Neither would Rudy.
4052660	4058660	Fuck it. Who else came from way far away? It's your birthday. What's your name, sir? Josh, where are you from?
4058660	4063660	San Antonio. Bring it up, Josh. Happy birthday.
4063660	4068660	You guys are okay. You have all kinds of stuff.
4068660	4074660	Josh, when you get up here, Steve, someone's going to diagnose you on the spectrum.
4074660	4084660	Where are we at, Steve, so far on the neurodiversity? It's 9 11.
4084660	4090660	What up, Josh? Happy birthday. How old are you today? I'll be 37 on Thanksgiving. That's not your fucking birthday then, Josh.
4090660	4098660	I lied to you. I'm sorry. Oh, come on. Hey, how many of y'all got boot on stage today?
4098660	4102660	Lies. It's all lies. I made Dan Harmon laugh. All right, shit.
4102660	4107660	Okay, Josh, you're from San Antonio. I am. I'm going to be there in a few days. What's that bar?
4107660	4112660	They used to be an old billiard hall where they have fuck off deviled eggs. It's got like a neon sign up front.
4112660	4116660	I don't know. I'll take you somewhere better. Okay.
4116660	4124660	You've lied to me once already, Josh. All right. Well, in the show's defense, you did say, who's from somewhere else?
4124660	4134660	And he was like, San Antonio, you're like, come up here. So like I'm on his side, if anyone's like, boo, because he didn't ask for this.
4134660	4140660	They didn't ask for it. He yelled out. It's my birthday. I did. I totally did. All right. So it's not, and it's not.
4140660	4146660	That's not. But, but right now, let's, uh, let's get to work.
4146660	4156660	What do you think? You think maybe you're autistic or did you write a beautiful letter about like the fucking nature of my soul?
4156660	4162660	I have a question. Where's your fucking kimono? First off, I could recite some poetry.
4162660	4171660	The community is like, hands down, my favorite show on behalf of everyone who loves it. Thank you very much for making that.
4171660	4179660	I've seen it about 500 times from beginning to end. And I think that has something to do with autism. I know they're finding comfort in the repetition.
4179660	4186660	And it, you know, as someone who also doesn't have a whole lot of friends like this show does, it gives you that sense of community.
4186660	4193660	I think it's one of Maslow's hierarchy of, you know, self realization that you continue. Yeah.
4193660	4209660	Well, Maslow had nine other hierarchies that are less publicized and for good reason. Maslow's hierarchy of crushing puss, which was a best selling book.
4209660	4220660	I was like, like, like there were like nine sets. He had a hierarchy of surfing, a hierarchy of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, cabbage diet.
4220660	4226660	All right. I'm sorry. I can't, I can't go to the carpet again. Well, a sense of, a sense of community.
4226660	4232660	Maslow's hierarchy of carpet. All right. Sorry. Continue, please. Draw fire.
4232660	4237660	Well, I had a question about community. Can Chang astral project?
4238660	4245660	There's an episode where they all go out to, uh, and you know, Britta wants to spray paint the, the billboard or whatever.
4245660	4252660	And she's hanging out with Michael and then Chang is like running through the theater, but no one acknowledges him whatsoever.
4252660	4258660	And then there's another time at the, at the table where just like no one acknowledges him. And I'm like, is he really there?
4259660	4268660	Yeah. That was the, the idea was that he might, he himself might be a ghost or, or he might have been interacting with ghosts all night.
4268660	4273660	Well, if I would imagine if you could astral project that you could, that's your ghost, right? You're asking for prevention.
4273660	4281660	Thank you. I love that episode. And I got like that episode. How about John Oliver as a dramatic actor?
4282660	4295660	Let me ask you a question, not to fire back your face, but in this weird time of community being shopped around as a streaming thing.
4295660	4308660	If, uh, maybe something on the table were like, oh, uh, we'd pay more if you did, uh, more episodes or if you did a movie or whatever.
4308660	4319660	I wrote a script for it. If you want it, I'll email it to you. That's not what I was, where I was going, but as a consumer, which is what you are.
4319660	4334660	Indeed. Don't lose sight. Uh, uh, what's that? Would you, like, would you, do you want to, like, would you want to see a community movie? Absolutely.
4334660	4344660	Yes. That's easy. Yes. Who wants free ice cream?
4344660	4354660	I was like, would you want to see a community movie that was a, like, do you want to see everybody? Like, I mean, what does that entail?
4354660	4369660	Like, I, I only want to ask you cause like, you know, even though, like, I just want to complain about this for a second while I'm drunk. Uh, for a second, if I was parks and rec, it would just be like, oh, should I sell to Netflix or the peacock? No.
4369660	4379660	It's a community. So it's like, well, are you going to make a movie or not? I'm sure Netflix would buy it in like half a heartbeat. Yeah. I'm sure they'd buy a lot of fucking Netflix.
4379660	4395660	Fucking Walmart of TV. Fuck. You could, you could do it as an animation. Bojack Horseman's canceled, but everyone was watching it. Like, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right. Okay. Thank you, Josh. Welcome. I was scared for Josh. Everybody. Thank you, brother.
4395660	4408660	All right. All right. Let's get out of the television business. Nobody, nobody heard that. Steve. Uh, look, uh, you're a dead head. Yes. You worked with Allen Ginsburg.
4408660	4437660	I did. You're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're a gay married journalist. You work at good work. I was his teaching assistant. What the hell? Yeah. When I was a teenager. That's why I love him. Well, that's fucked up. Star fucker. You fucking star fucker. We knew it. It got me here tonight. Exactly. What other qualifications do I have? You're a chemistry teacher. You're like, Hey, potassium plus fluoride equals potassium fluoride.
4438660	4466660	I don't, I don't think that's how it works. Okay. All right. Look, Keith, what's your favorite? Uh, hydrocarbon. Uh, top five, top five, hydroclarmin. Methane, ethane. Just go in order. Yeah. Yeah. I got a soft spot for hexane. Oh, okay. Yeah. Wow. That's a fucking hot take. That's a fucking. Yeah. That's a sentence I never thought I would hear today. It's a sentence I've never said before.
4467660	4471660	All right. Now is hexane a hydrocarbon? Yeah, great.
4473660	4486660	And it's like six aims and it's, I'm sure there's exothermic reactions involved there, right? Well, it's, it's pretty flammable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually it's a cool demo that you can, the, the, it evaporates and the vapor is both heavier than air and super flammable. So you can do it.
4496660	4499820	and pour it like down a ramp to a candle
4499820	4501460	and then it burns up the whole ramp.
4501460	4505480	Keith, for $5 out of my own pocket,
4505480	4509460	at what temperature is methane liquid?
4509460	4510300	Oh.
4512100	4514820	I literally just taught about the boiling points
4514820	4519820	of hydrocarbons last week and I don't know.
4519820	4521460	You can look at the periodic table.
4521460	4526460	Yeah, no, it's cold, it's really cold.
4526660	4527660	It's gotta be real cold.
4527660	4528700	It's gotta be real cold.
4528700	4529540	You gotta be on one of them.
4529540	4531580	You gotta be real cold.
4531580	4533420	That's pretty much the level of expertise
4533420	4534620	I bring to my classroom.
4534620	4536900	Yeah, what's the boiling point of this?
4536900	4537740	Real cold.
4537740	4538580	Really cold.
4538580	4540340	Are there like seas of it?
4540340	4542620	As far as I'm concerned, you're bulletproof
4542620	4544380	because you've tied a motherfucking bow tie
4544380	4545900	without looking like that.
4545900	4546860	You are now.
4546860	4548460	And well being yelled at.
4548460	4550340	You're my Superman.
4550340	4553420	Is it, you know, if it's prying whatever
4553420	4555180	because you have students, whatever.
4555740	4557100	Like how did you guys meet?
4557100	4558260	That's what I wanna know.
4558260	4559660	I wanna hear the.
4559660	4561500	Let's not say the name of the group.
4561500	4562700	We won't.
4562700	4566220	We met online before the web.
4566220	4567900	I had written an article for Wired
4567900	4569740	about gay and lesbian teenagers
4569740	4572020	building community on America Online
4572020	4575020	and everybody said, yeah, American Online sucks
4575020	4576860	but check out Usenet.
4576860	4580500	So I went to Usenet and I just spent a month and a half
4580500	4582420	interviewing these little gay kids
4582420	4584900	who were like saving each other from suicide
4585500	4586820	and taking each other in when they ran away
4586820	4588580	from their abusive parents and whatnot.
4588580	4591260	And the first thing I see on Usenet
4591260	4594180	was some bitchy queen saying,
4594180	4595940	oh, these young gay kids these days,
4595940	4597740	they're all airheads and twinks.
4597740	4600260	They're squandering the freedoms we fought so hard
4600260	4601460	for at Stonewall.
4601460	4602300	Oh, Keith.
4602300	4603140	And.
4603140	4603980	It was not me.
4603980	4604820	No, it was not you.
4604820	4606620	It was not me.
4606620	4607740	His roommate.
4607740	4608980	Yeah, no.
4608980	4611660	And so I wrote back and I said,
4611660	4612940	no, actually they were amazing.
4613180	4615460	You know, I have this article in Wired magazine,
4615460	4616460	blah, blah, blah.
4616460	4619020	Keith wrote me the next day and said,
4619020	4620460	are you the same Steve Silverman
4620460	4622660	who reviews Grateful Dead shows
4622660	4624420	for this online community called The Will?
4624420	4625820	That's the connection, is it dead?
4625820	4626660	It's true.
4627780	4630180	And he said, gay dead heads are rare,
4630180	4631420	which was true.
4631420	4633460	And so I walked into a.
4633460	4634700	Gay dead heads are rare.
4634700	4636460	Yeah, they are.
4636460	4638540	They're more common now, but yeah.
4638540	4640220	I imagine, well, anything dead head is rare,
4640220	4642220	like black dead heads are rare.
4642380	4643940	Women dead heads are rare.
4643940	4645740	Well, there are a lot of women dead heads.
4645740	4646740	OK, well, they're half the planet.
4646740	4648540	There are zero gay parrot heads.
4648540	4649660	There's only.
4649660	4650980	There are no gay parrot heads.
4650980	4652060	We have better taste than that.
4652060	4653020	But anyway, so.
4655140	4657900	So after I talked to Keith on the phone a couple of times,
4657900	4659980	I went to meet him at a brew pub in Berkeley
4659980	4660820	and I walked in.
4660820	4665540	We had not talked about our ages or our appearance.
4665540	4667700	And so I am 12 years older than Keith.
4667700	4668900	I'm a double large.
4668900	4670540	That's so gross.
4670540	4671380	I know it's gross.
4671380	4672740	I'm 12 years older than Cody.
4672740	4673860	I actually got Ophelia.
4673860	4677180	So so in any case, I walked into the brew pub
4677180	4679300	and there was this fucking gorgeous guy.
4679300	4681020	And I thought to myself, oh, this is
4681020	4682420	going to be a nightmare for him.
4682420	4685900	He's going to think like I'm some old troll from the internet.
4685900	4689180	But actually, he liked me and we liked each other.
4689180	4690780	And we've been together for 25 years.
4690780	4691260	Wow.
4696420	4699540	And about a month, about a month and a half
4699540	4702100	after we met, we were on fish tour together.
4702100	4703740	We were.
4703740	4705780	We went to show in Chico, actually.
4705780	4708180	The only time I've been to Chico, I saw a fish play in a gym.
4708180	4709220	Dave Matthews.
4709220	4709740	No, no, no.
4709740	4710100	Oh, god, no.
4710100	4711300	We had better taste than that.
4711300	4712020	No, no, no.
4712020	4713340	X-Day.
4713340	4714660	Steve's not here, but.
4714660	4716140	Can I ask you both?
4716140	4719420	So you're both dead heads and fish food.
4719420	4721420	What do you call fish lovers?
4721420	4722420	Fins with a P-H.
4722420	4722940	What?
4722940	4723540	Fins.
4723540	4724860	Fish fan.
4724860	4725860	Fins.
4725860	4727580	Fanatics, they call them.
4727580	4728940	What is?
4728940	4730180	And I'm not talking shit.
4730180	4734540	What is the appeal of dead head, like Grateful Dead and fish?
4734540	4737980	Because I listen to it and I don't really get it.
4737980	4741580	Yeah, it's improv, you know, jazz style improvisation
4741580	4744260	applied to rock and roll music, basically.
4744260	4748780	So if you hear jazz and you think, boring,
4748780	4750500	you probably won't like the dead or fish.
4750500	4751780	Right, Dave.
4751780	4755220	It's because you're watching transparency on stage.
4755220	4756500	They're doing something.
4756500	4758020	They're going like, hey, let me try this.
4758620	4759140	Right.
4759140	4760380	And they're like, oh, oh.
4760380	4761740	Is it really all improv?
4761740	4764220	Or are they doing like, they have, obviously, songs.
4764220	4766180	They have songs, but they improvise segues.
4766180	4768100	And a lot of the.
4768100	4770100	They'll just do like, they'll just riff for a while.
4770100	4772660	So we would be pretty big hypocrites.
4772660	4774900	That's such an important distinction.
4774900	4776060	It's not just riffing.
4776060	4778180	It's more like narrative storytelling
4778180	4780540	without words, basically, using.
4780540	4781740	But improvisationally?
4781740	4782340	Yes.
4782340	4783060	OK, wow.
4783100	4787100	And it's Fish, for me, what I love
4787100	4789140	about their improvisations and their style
4789140	4795500	is that they build these sort of repetitive and yet subtly,
4795500	4798500	slowly changing sort of patterns.
4798500	4800500	And I swear, it's just like how my brain works.
4800500	4803060	Like, I do great thinking at fish shows.
4803060	4803540	Really?
4803540	4804380	Yeah, like they'll.
4804380	4806860	That's actually a big thing for both dead and fish,
4806860	4809460	is that it gives one a chance to be alone with oneself
4809460	4812140	in a really beautiful way in a crowd of people.
4812140	4812460	Yeah.
4812460	4813900	I love being alone around people.
4813900	4815620	That's one of my favorite things.
4815620	4818380	Our friend, Harris Whittles, was a big fish guy.
4818380	4822900	Had a whole podcast about like, come at me about fish.
4822900	4824140	And that was his whole thing.
4824140	4827260	He would write on Parks and Rec and was like a valued employee.
4827260	4828740	And then he'd go to fish concerts.
4828740	4831980	And he was like, I'd never heard it described that way, though,
4831980	4835100	that it's a way to actually, it allows
4835100	4836820	you to keep people at a distance.
4836820	4840020	Now that Jerry's gone, do you still go?
4840020	4841900	Do they still have dead shows?
4841980	4842820	They do.
4842820	4845260	Do you still go to them?
4845260	4846540	Not so much.
4846540	4847940	Jerry was a big piece.
4847940	4849260	Jerry was a genius.
4849260	4852860	But let's say I don't know anything about any of this.
4852860	4856220	If I went to, like, just walked in cold to a fish show,
4856220	4858220	what do you think my neurotypical?
4858220	4859660	You might think it was really boring.
4859660	4860820	Yeah.
4860820	4862900	And you might think the lyrics were nonsense.
4862900	4866860	And you think that most of the fans are robotic cult members.
4866860	4868060	Well, like, I was in a.
4868060	4869420	You know, say things in unison.
4869420	4872620	I was in a dive bar in Orlando, Florida.
4872620	4875740	And a giant group of people came in.
4875740	4879700	And there was a Jimmy Buffett show had just broken up.
4879700	4882400	And a bunch of 50-year-old, 50-something,
4882400	4884700	60-something parrot heads came in.
4884700	4887060	And they were the nicest, happiest fans
4887060	4888580	I've ever met in my life.
4888580	4890620	And so there must be something going on.
4890620	4891980	Because when I hear Jimmy Buffett,
4891980	4893300	I want to take my own life.
4893300	4893860	No, I know.
4893860	4894360	Exactly.
4894360	4894860	Yeah.
4894860	4895860	Yeah, absolutely.
4895860	4898060	Well, you know, I'll tell you something, actually.
4898100	4903220	Believe it or not, a Dan Harmon Grateful Dead connection, which
4903220	4907820	is that one of the things that we've been hearing about all
4907820	4911140	night tonight is misfit power.
4911140	4915300	That's how Bob Weir said it about the Grateful Dead.
4915300	4917460	That's what drew people to the Grateful Dead.
4917460	4919580	Because no, they were not cute.
4919580	4921260	No, they were not stylish.
4921260	4925220	No, it didn't matter if they had a hit record or not.
4925220	4929820	People would be self-selecting into the community of Dead
4929820	4930580	Heads.
4930580	4933460	And just because you love the music, and you like the people,
4933460	4935900	and you love to have a good time around these people,
4935900	4938540	but not a good time like those other people have,
4938540	4940100	but this good time.
4940100	4944020	And I think community is self-selected in the same way
4944020	4947460	for people who haven't felt at home in other places
4947460	4949780	in the world, but really feel at home here.
4949780	4953620	Yeah, we're like juggalos.
4956180	4957180	All right.
4957180	4957980	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
4957980	4961940	How do you guys feel about Rush, the band?
4961940	4962820	Not, not already.
4962820	4963860	Oh, Jeff is so excited.
4963860	4965260	Don't ask us about every band.
4965260	4966140	That's why Rush.
4966140	4968420	I've got a lightning bonus round.
4968420	4970420	Name bands.
4970420	4973220	When I listen to Phil Collins, nobody
4973220	4975700	has the relationship with Phil Collins that I have.
4975700	4980460	Except I had a roommate once who had the same relationship
4980460	4982220	with Phil Collins that I had.
4982220	4984180	And we would go like, yeah, she seems
4984180	4986100	to have an invisible touch.
4986100	4988140	And we were like, we were into it.
4988140	4992660	It was, Phil Collins wasn't doing anything wrong.
4992660	4996380	And we were doing something right by talking together.
4996380	4997180	Yes, he was.
4997180	4997700	He was.
4997700	4999660	You dicks.
4999660	5000940	Phil Collins.
5000940	5003340	Like correct me if I'm wrong, not to high road him,
5003340	5005780	but go ahead and fucking high road him.
5005780	5007780	Like that's the shit you're escaping when
5007780	5009820	you become a deadhead or a fish band.
5009820	5013500	It's like you're escaping the fucking snobbery, right?
5013500	5015980	Uh-huh.
5015980	5018340	The band's flipping off, Jeff.
5018340	5020460	No, because you're escaping the banality.
5020460	5022260	Like you're just like, you know what?
5022260	5024020	I don't know anything about fucking why
5024020	5025300	this is good or bad music.
5025300	5026740	But I'm just going to hang out.
5026740	5030220	Yeah, I mean, Phil Collins, you know, he's not my favorite.
5030220	5031820	Did you have to pick Phil Collins?
5031820	5033940	But when you sing Su Su Yo.
5033940	5034740	Who was there?
5034740	5035660	It's my eggshell.
5035660	5037980	What eggshell did you eat when you were fucking
5037980	5040620	going from an embryo to a chicken?
5040620	5042820	I love Neil Diamond way too much.
5042820	5044860	People have a love hate thing.
5044860	5046500	And I would never take that away from you.
5046500	5046980	No.
5046980	5050460	Because I'm a good friend.
5050460	5051700	Phil Collins.
5051700	5055020	I mean, Neil Diamond.
5055020	5055540	Come on.
5055540	5057340	There's not even a fucking contest there.
5057340	5058620	Oh, there he is.
5058620	5059820	But who?
5059820	5061060	He was a Jew.
5061060	5062820	Collins is a, like.
5062820	5063820	Neil Diamond was a Jew.
5063820	5064780	Make your biopic now.
5064780	5066780	He was a Jew who sang gospel music.
5066780	5067740	Oh, my god.
5067740	5070180	Phil Collins is a drummer in a band
5070180	5073460	that should never have existed.
5073460	5073940	I agree.
5073940	5077220	He's the fucking drummer and the master.
5077220	5079420	We agree on that.
5079420	5081420	Next you're going to say you love Sting and the police.
5081420	5082380	Like, fucking boo.
5082380	5082860	I don't.
5082860	5084100	Sting's great.
5084100	5086540	Fuck all of you people.
5086540	5087900	Also, Outcast.
5087900	5089300	Fun to listen to.
5089300	5091060	I don't understand you people.
5091060	5092300	I don't get it.
5092300	5093180	Hey, ya.
5093180	5094660	Like, it's a good song.
5094660	5095620	It's a toe tapper.
5095620	5096340	I don't get it.
5099340	5100620	The music's snobbery.
5100620	5103260	I don't know where it's supposed to end.
5105940	5110060	What is your guilty pleasure band shop?
5110060	5112620	Like, where you're like, where people go like,
5112620	5114340	what kind of music are you into?
5114340	5115660	And you're like, oh, well, I'm not
5115660	5118180	going to mention this because I don't want to be made fun of.
5118180	5122700	Well, I like Oingo Boingo.
5122700	5124220	Do you like Enya?
5124220	5125820	Yeah, I do like Enya.
5125820	5127020	That's one maybe, right?
5127020	5128180	Yeah.
5128180	5129300	Fucking good way.
5129300	5130500	Fucking way.
5130500	5131820	Steve, Steve, what is it?
5131820	5132780	So you're a deadhead.
5132780	5135140	You're super hip.
5135140	5137900	You get your Ginsburg, San Francisco,
5137900	5141060	married gay journalist credits.
5141060	5147620	Now tell us, who's the fucking, like, what's the Spotify thing
5147620	5151660	you click that you're embarrassed about?
5151660	5154100	Well, especially on this stage.
5154620	5156620	You're going to ruin that appetite.
5156620	5157700	All right, you're competing.
5157700	5160060	Is that the sting rocks?
5160060	5162660	Is that a box of candy we all shit in?
5162660	5164580	There's too many things happening at once here.
5175180	5176700	Rob, well, you do me a favor.
5176700	5179100	And also, it's only for visual.
5179100	5181020	I was talking about Billy Zane earlier.
5181020	5182860	Will you just take your glasses off again?
5182860	5183740	No, I'm not going to.
5184700	5192380	Give me your nonverbal, just facial Billy Zane.
5192380	5194260	Dan, tell him I don't have to do it.
5194260	5195220	Did you say sticks?
5195220	5196060	Is that what you're saying?
5196060	5196860	No, stings.
5196860	5198340	Stings, yeah.
5198340	5199540	Stings voice.
5199540	5200580	Give me a break.
5200580	5201100	Yeah.
5201100	5203980	Like, are we going to pretend there's nothing remarkable
5203980	5205540	about stings voice?
5205540	5209220	Oh, yeah, let's all go to our graves in denial.
5209220	5209700	Right.
5209700	5211820	That's ridiculous.
5211820	5212300	Police.
5212300	5214340	And I almost said retarded.
5214340	5215740	But I changed it to ridiculous.
5215740	5216740	Give me some Billy Zane, just for a second.
5216740	5219060	Because Sting taught me patience.
5219060	5219860	Just do a little.
5219860	5221380	Just give me one second, Billy Zane.
5221380	5222380	It's an easy pimping, man.
5222380	5223220	I don't want to do it.
5223220	5223740	What?
5223740	5224740	You don't want to do Billy Zane?
5224740	5225660	Don't do it, Shropp.
5225660	5227660	I mean, you put me on the spot, I don't want to do it.
5227660	5230700	I had the time I had, man.
5230700	5232500	Come on, just do your fucking.
5232500	5233740	All right, wait, Shropp, wait.
5233740	5237660	You were a shit to me last week in the writer's room.
5237660	5238460	Talk of dish.
5238460	5239260	You were so mean.
5239260	5240060	Dish.
5240060	5241980	You were so mean.
5241980	5242620	Dish.
5242620	5243340	Thursday.
5243340	5244660	You did a great job.
5244660	5249260	No, you said, you said, I just want to beat the living hell out
5249260	5249780	of you right now.
5249780	5252260	Oh my god, you were being such a dick the whole day.
5252260	5254340	I was not a being a dick.
5254340	5255060	I was not.
5255060	5257420	I'm trying to help save your show.
5257420	5259300	Oh my god, you wrote a great script.
5259300	5261580	And then you're just like, the next week, you're just like,
5261580	5262980	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5262980	5265420	You're like an eight-year-old child of 46.
5265420	5267100	Like, why are you going to act like that?
5267100	5268340	I'm just like, like, go, go, go, go.
5268340	5270140	What did I do that deserved physical violence?
5270140	5271900	I'm sitting there, like, struggling.
5271900	5273700	I'm trying to help people, like, write a good show.
5273700	5276060	And you're just like, bleh, bleh, bleh.
5276060	5278780	I'm like, I'm like, oh, you could do this and do that.
5278780	5280420	I just want to beat the living hell out of you.
5280420	5282260	I really, and I meant that.
5282260	5283580	I know.
5283580	5284620	I know.
5284620	5286660	I know, and you're not a violent guy.
5286660	5291060	Because I wanted to beat you with a baseball bat.
5291060	5295220	I told that to Kate, and I said, Dan said he wanted to beat
5295220	5296420	me with a baseball bat.
5296420	5299460	And you know what she said if she's a good partner?
5299460	5300900	What did you do?
5300900	5302100	Yeah.
5302100	5303340	She did.
5303340	5306140	Because I was saying it like, I didn't want to beat you.
5306140	5307780	Because she knows you.
5307780	5309500	Why are you smiling?
5309500	5310820	And I'm like, because it was awesome.
5310820	5311540	I did it.
5311540	5315500	I got Dan to threaten to beat me with a baseball bat.
5315500	5318660	And if Kate is the woman I know she is, she was like,
5318660	5320340	what did you do?
5320340	5322500	Yes.
5322500	5323500	What did you do?
5323500	5324820	Fucking, why did you do it?
5324820	5325740	Hang in there.
5325740	5328820	We have a goldmine in front of us, 70 episodes.
5328820	5331860	Everyone, keep your cool.
5331860	5334500	I'll just make a bunch of money.
5334500	5335740	What were you talking about?
5335740	5336900	Billy Zane.
5336900	5338780	Billy Zane.
5338780	5342500	Do your Billy Zane, or I'll give you this option.
5342500	5344500	Because it's one of the best impressions I've ever seen
5344500	5346340	Rob Schwab do.
5346340	5348620	We were in LA not that long.
5348620	5357020	And Schwab came to, Schwab said, I'm pretty sure I think
5357020	5362540	Nicholas Cage drove by me on a motorcycle today.
5362540	5365180	And this is like 20 years ago.
5365180	5367540	And I was like, how do you know it was Nicholas Cage?
5367540	5371340	He was like, well, he was wearing a helmet.
5371340	5374700	And I was like, well, then how on earth
5374700	5376220	would you know it was Nicholas Cage?
5376220	5381260	And Schwab answered my question by holding a folder
5381260	5383220	in front of his face.
5383220	5386260	And with his eyes and eyebrows alone,
5386260	5389620	convinced it going like, oh, that's Nicholas Cage.
5389620	5395380	So nice, nice, nice.
5401860	5405940	For $5 a month, you can see what just happened.
5405940	5408420	Go to hermitown.com.
5408420	5409740	Give me a hug, Rob, Rob.
5409740	5410220	Just for me.
5410220	5411780	I want to fucking do it.
5411780	5414300	Happy birthday, dictionary bullshit.
5414300	5416220	Give me a little fucking bill of things.
5416220	5419300	I'm not a different.
5419300	5421380	I don't want to do it.
5421380	5424020	You just did Nicholas Cage.
5424020	5425020	That's fine.
5425020	5425860	I gave him that out.
5425860	5426420	He did that.
5426420	5427020	That's fine.
5427020	5428020	Oh, that was a choice.
5428020	5430060	What'd you do that made Dan so mad?
5430060	5434980	Well, Dan said he wanted a, he was working on his panic room.
5434980	5435740	Sure.
5435740	5442020	And then I said, you should have a panic at the disco room.
5442020	5443980	No, that's not.
5444620	5445620	That's a great idea.
5445620	5450700	I just want to take a bat and beat the hell out of you.
5450700	5452300	I just want to beat.
5452300	5454780	And he was like, and I mean it.
5454780	5456020	And I mean it.
5456020	5457460	Nothing about that is accurate.
5457460	5459220	That is so true.
5459220	5461020	Nothing about that is accurate.
5461020	5462860	No, it's totally accurate.
5462860	5464020	You wanted to beat the hell out of me.
5464020	5466500	No, I was talking about the fucking show.
5466500	5469260	I'm trying to write Rick and Morty with you.
5469260	5472660	And I said halfway through a rant, as I riff,
5472660	5475380	I go like, oh, well, I don't know.
5475380	5476860	Maybe it'd be like a thing like this,
5476860	5478220	and I don't want to be like that.
5478220	5483220	And I said, as I want to, I said, oh, well, then
5483220	5485500	that would be like a Christopher Drang thing.
5485500	5490620	And in my mind, I was going like, well, maybe it's
5490620	5492900	like so much metaphor that it's absurd.
5492900	5493740	You hang a lantern.
5493740	5495340	I don't even know what I was referencing.
5495340	5496780	I'm not like a theater major.
5496780	5498740	But I got like Christopher Drang.
5498740	5499940	I throw it out.
5499940	5501380	I throw out a lot of things.
5501380	5502380	I keep talking.
5503020	5507700	Because I fucking try, and I work, to keep my show afloat.
5507700	5509420	And this guy's sitting over there.
5509420	5511620	And then it wasn't, it was like he's sitting over there,
5511620	5513100	looking just like he is right now.
5513100	5519780	And he's 50 years old.
5519780	5522380	Don't let him fool you.
5522380	5524220	He's 50.
5524220	5526820	So there's no excuse for what I'm about to tell you.
5526820	5530220	And I keep going, like, well, what if Rick had this
5530220	5531260	relationship with this?
5531260	5533660	And so when they do the laser thing,
5533660	5535340	and we don't want the cannon to be this.
5535340	5537300	And this is finally like silence,
5537300	5539140	because my fucking lungs collapsed.
5539140	5543460	And we're just like, ugh, ugh, silence.
5543460	5549500	And then Schwab goes, oh, what would Christopher Drang do?
5549500	5554700	And that's when I said, I want to fucking pound your face in.
5554700	5559340	Because you knew what you were doing.
5559340	5563700	Because all you do is sit there, and I fucking talk.
5563700	5566300	And I'm like, I'm going to fucking talk.
5566300	5568260	And then you're like, Christopher Drang.
5568260	5570780	I'm like, fuck you, fuck you.
5570780	5572820	You know I was mad at you.
5572820	5574060	I was mad at you.
5574060	5575140	Yeah, that's funny.
5575140	5578580	And then as soon as I said, I want to beat your face,
5578580	5581140	I was like, I'm not mad at you anymore.
5581140	5584700	Because you guys have been together 25 years.
5584700	5585580	Try 30.
5585580	5586140	Yeah.
5586140	5587100	Really, really?
5587100	5588340	And try not fucking.
5589620	5591620	That's, yeah.
5591620	5594140	See if, try that.
5594140	5594860	Yeah.
5594860	5598460	Work with Steve Silverman for 25 years, and don't fuck him.
5598460	5599260	Yeah.
5599260	5601700	See if you can handle this shit.
5601700	5603180	Because you can't.
5603180	5603980	All right?
5603980	5607700	Like it gets fucking, it gets on your nerves sometimes.
5607700	5612660	This guy, Christopher Drang, I'm like, fuck you.
5612660	5614540	I didn't really do, what the fuck, man?
5614540	5618100	And why did you let my panic in the disco show?
5619100	5623380	I'm trying to make your life better by adding humor.
5623380	5625100	You're trying to make your life better.
5625100	5627060	Adding spice.
5627060	5628220	Why don't you guys just fuck?
5632900	5634780	Finally.
5634780	5635660	You know what?
5635660	5639980	I would, except it would be a disservice to the gay community.
5639980	5643180	Because it would be too straight, guys, like reinforcing
5643180	5644980	the idea that fucking is about power.
5644980	5647060	I think after seven years of harm in town,
5647180	5650060	it's high time for some heterosexual grudge fucking.
5650060	5651060	Yeah, I don't know.
5651060	5652420	I won't take part in that.
5652420	5655860	But I want to say, look, like, Schwab wrote,
5655860	5658780	like it'll be 70 years from now, the way Rick and Morty's
5658780	5659460	schedule goes.
5659460	5661300	Schwab wrote an amazing script.
5661300	5662780	Schwab is a great writer.
5662780	5664420	Schwab is on Rick and Morty now.
5664420	5667660	Schwab did a great job.
5667660	5670460	That's why I don't know why he's being such a fucking cock
5670460	5671500	all the time.
5671500	5675460	Like I'm just sitting, and then like, I'm like, it's just like,
5675460	5678420	I go in, and they go like, hey, guys, what if the story
5678420	5680540	was about a thing, and it was about a thing?
5680540	5682420	And then Schwab's like, about a thing?
5685860	5688020	But that's why Schwab is the greatest.
5688020	5689580	What are you, a fucking eight?
5689580	5690180	I don't know.
5690180	5691100	I don't know what to tell you.
5691100	5692020	Well, how am I supposed to do it, Brian?
5692020	5692660	I don't know what to tell you.
5692660	5693380	Show me.
5693380	5695260	No, I'm not going to let you do that to me.
5695260	5699700	I'm not going to let you tell me what to tell you.
5699700	5701700	I'm glad you're there.
5701780	5707020	Dan, have you been on a show not as like the top?
5707020	5708900	Like, have you ever been in a shop position
5708900	5709660	where you're like writing?
5709660	5711660	I mean, you have at least a couple times, right?
5711660	5713460	Like in award ceremonies or whatever.
5713460	5715300	As a writer, like you're a staff writer.
5715300	5716860	Yeah, and it didn't go well.
5716860	5719500	I'm not trying to got you or whatever, but it's just like.
5719500	5722260	No, no, no, I've been, yeah, you're exactly right.
5722260	5729500	The only capacity is like award shows for which I won awards.
5729500	5733180	Because that's how you work.
5733180	5736580	Yeah, we got the same.
5736580	5738820	I took mine home.
5738820	5739820	Yeah, I got mine too.
5739820	5741020	OK, great.
5741020	5743740	It doesn't, yeah.
5743740	5747100	But like, it got the same.
5747100	5750420	It absolutely is a flaw of mine that I did not.
5750420	5751460	He likes me.
5751460	5752620	I was just wondering.
5752620	5756620	This is what somebody who likes me looks like.
5756620	5757140	See?
5757140	5757620	Wow.
5757620	5758660	I am not taking sides.
5758660	5759860	Yeah, you are.
5759860	5760380	Yeah, you are.
5760380	5762620	Who's the potassium and who's the nitrate?
5762620	5763860	Yeah, I want to know.
5763860	5764900	That's all I want to know.
5764900	5767820	All right, now let's get back to these guys for Christ's sake.
5767820	5769140	Let me ask you a question.
5769140	5772420	Since the show is winding down, this is the penultimate show,
5772420	5774460	is there anything that you guys have always
5774460	5777380	wanted to say to each other that's been building up?
5777380	5777860	Ooh.
5777860	5780380	This holds me up.
5780380	5781060	Look, man.
5781060	5786340	You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss.
5786340	5787500	I know.
5787500	5790860	I will say to you, Steve Silverman,
5790860	5794500	it has always been a huge thing for Shrob.
5798180	5802660	Like, this idea of me as an available person.
5802660	5804340	Like, this whole thing.
5804340	5806900	Like, oh, Dean Harmon's so hard.
5806900	5809220	He's so, like, yeah.
5809220	5810340	It's so easy for him.
5810340	5811140	So what?
5811140	5811740	So what?
5811740	5813020	You didn't finish your sentence.
5813020	5816140	What am I saying all the time?
5816140	5817940	See, so what am I?
5817940	5818580	What?
5818580	5819180	What?
5819180	5823420	You did an amazing job on that script.
5823420	5826980	Like, it is my dream come true that you're
5826980	5828420	working on the show.
5828420	5831460	Like, my heart bursts when I wake up in the morning.
5831460	5833860	I'm like, the shit that I've been going through,
5833860	5837020	I'm like, Shrob's on the show now.
5837020	5838980	Like, it's like, holy shit.
5838980	5841620	It's like a comforter around me.
5841620	5844900	I'm like, even if I'm like, it's so great.
5844900	5847500	Like, the work that you've done.
5847500	5849740	Like, that's how I express love.
5849740	5851020	Yeah.
5851020	5852540	Yeah.
5852540	5855100	So yeah.
5855100	5856820	And that applause says that that's
5856820	5860460	all the love I need to express.
5860460	5865700	And so any need beyond that is the need of a faulty person.
5865700	5867620	Right?
5867620	5869540	Everyone agrees.
5869540	5873340	A chemistry teacher, a journalist, both dead
5873740	5879740	Everyone agrees that if you need emotionally, you're crippled.
5879740	5885820	Because you could get everything you need from me through output.
5885820	5887780	You've done such a good job.
5887780	5889020	Dan, Dan, you fucked it.
5889020	5890580	You fucked up there, right?
5890580	5891980	I wasn't trying to not fuck it.
5891980	5893140	You had us and you lost us.
5893140	5896100	No, I'm proving my philosophy true.
5896100	5897780	You're saying the only reason that you love him
5897780	5900700	is his value to your output, your product.
5904180	5906020	I'm eight.
5906020	5907860	And I'm eight.
5907860	5909380	His motherfucker like, stings.
5909380	5911260	What are you supposed to just love people?
5911260	5913420	And then you're like, hey, I love you.
5913420	5915060	Come upstairs.
5915060	5916300	What does pen in your hand?
5916300	5918140	What if you could write the show?
5918140	5919260	No, that would be awful.
5922860	5925460	Do you love him as a friend, as an emotional asset,
5925460	5930100	as an ally in your travels and surveillance?
5930100	5933180	So awkward.
5933180	5939060	He's my brother in a world where there aren't any.
5945060	5947620	What do you people want from me?
5947620	5951300	It's like, why does everybody start laughing at that stuff?
5951300	5952700	Hey, Dan, do a pull up.
5952700	5954700	And then I start doing a pull up, and everyone's like, oh.
5954700	5956300	Oh, god.
5956300	5959020	He's your brother, but say why.
5959020	5959660	Break it down.
5959660	5960700	He's my brother.
5963380	5965580	Like, forever.
5965580	5967380	Yeah.
5967380	5968220	I get it.
5968220	5969340	What's the?
5969340	5970980	Why is everybody like, why is it always
5970980	5973500	the theme of the show is always like, oh, you guys.
5973500	5974940	Like, what do you want me to say?
5974940	5975980	Like, I love you.
5975980	5977380	Like, that's so fucking dumb.
5977380	5978420	Do you?
5978420	5980780	Well, like, what does it mean if you don't mean it?
5980780	5981940	Like, what do we say?
5981940	5982460	Oh.
5984980	5987220	I don't know what those words mean.
5987220	5988980	What does it mean?
5988980	5990860	Those words can be lies.
5990860	5992140	People can go, I love Hitler.
5992140	5992940	They don't mean it.
5993020	5995860	Like, if you don't love Hitler, like, that
5995860	5997020	means you love racism.
5997020	5997700	Just stop.
5997700	5999820	Just stop.
5999820	6002980	See, you guys lured me into this fucking trap.
6002980	6004540	This is what always happens to me.
6004540	6007220	Hey, Dan, why don't you express yourself as a person.
6007220	6009260	Fucking pussy.
6009260	6011820	Fucking shit face.
6011820	6015740	You fucking, like, you're neurodiverse.
6015740	6017820	Fucking shit face.
6017820	6019260	Like, they lure me into this trap.
6019260	6020780	Just say you love Rob Shropp.
6021620	6022820	I love Rob Shropp.
6022820	6024220	This is his Billy Zane.
6024220	6026780	Will you leave him alone?
6026780	6028900	God, he doesn't want to be Billy Zane.
6028900	6029820	I'll give you a trace.
6029820	6033260	Either do Billy Zane or tell Rob you love him and made him.
6033260	6035300	Why do you guys have to say, I love Rob Shropp.
6035300	6036900	I don't want to do Billy Zane.
6036900	6038100	Yeah.
6038100	6038900	Yeah.
6038900	6039740	What do you guys want?
6042580	6046300	I don't approve of any of this.
6046300	6049300	Is that just like, is that what the Midwest is?
6049900	6050820	That much withholding?
6050820	6053300	I don't want to touch this idea, but I love you.
6053300	6053860	I love you.
6053860	6054380	I love you.
6054380	6056700	It's like a fucking poker chip you put on the table.
6056700	6059060	Like, what the fuck does it mean?
6059060	6061660	It means you got a chip at the fucking cashier.
6061660	6063060	Dad's like, I love you.
6063060	6064740	Like, people go, I love you.
6064740	6065780	I love you, too.
6065780	6068700	I'm trying to, like, Cody's family, they say it,
6068700	6069580	and I believe them.
6069580	6071020	And I'm like, I love you, too.
6071020	6074700	It's hard for me to say it to Cody's dad.
6074700	6077340	But those people say, I love you.
6077340	6079380	They're fucking just hanging out.
6079380	6080700	Like, it's just like farting.
6080700	6082220	And they're just like, I love you.
6082220	6084860	And they're like, I don't know what I mean.
6084860	6086820	It's just not the family I come from.
6086820	6089980	It's just like, those words mean something.
6089980	6091020	Can you help me out here?
6091020	6092220	What's your love language?
6092220	6094500	Because it sounds like words of affirmation aren't it,
6094500	6096060	but you got to have one.
6096060	6097180	Good point.
6097180	6099540	I mean, it's not like, this is a normal thing that happens.
6099540	6101700	People are like, I don't want all these fucking gifts,
6101700	6102700	you know, or whatever.
6102700	6106500	With Cody, it's like, all bets are off.
6106500	6107220	It's just whatever.
6107220	6109020	And I think that maybe part of the problem
6109020	6113660	is that I go like, oh, that's an intimacy thing.
6113660	6115140	Love is for partners.
6115140	6117380	And that makes it maybe sexual.
6117380	6119940	And so maybe then you're not supposed
6119940	6123060	to say I love you to people that you're not partners with.
6123060	6125980	Well, Keith and Steve, 25 years, can you
6125980	6128700	define what love is between you two?
6128700	6131700	Yeah, we don't want to kill each other.
6131700	6133780	Well, we take the desire to kill each other,
6133780	6136700	and we crumple it down into a tiny little ball.
6137220	6138140	It's Thanksgiving.
6138140	6139340	What do you guys do?
6139340	6142820	How are your relationships with your family?
6142820	6144940	But that's important.
6144940	6146340	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6146340	6147100	But you're.
6147100	6150580	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6150580	6152860	Are your families hip to your relationship?
6152860	6155540	Oh, yeah, they are.
6155540	6158860	But there's some political issues.
6158860	6162700	My family is liberal, and Keith's family, not so much.
6162700	6165260	So the last three years have been terrible for us
6165260	6166820	in that regard, actually.
6166820	6168020	Really, really?
6168020	6171460	It was the election that actually created a divide.
6171460	6173900	The election and the propaganda wave.
6173900	6175300	Because it brought it to the fore.
6175300	6176180	It's true.
6176180	6179100	I mean, my mother-in-law literally
6179100	6182100	made us lovely embroidered tea towels with her name
6182100	6184100	before the election.
6184100	6185700	But there's been a breach.
6185700	6189100	When you guys first declared your love to your families,
6189100	6192700	were both sides OK with it, or was it a little rough?
6192700	6195100	Oh, you have a great story on this one.
6196100	6198180	When my dad pulled you aside.
6198180	6199740	Oh, yeah, that's right.
6199740	6202580	I was scared to meet Keith's family,
6202580	6204460	because they were like Midwesterners.
6204460	6207580	Keith's dad was literally the mayor of Normal, Illinois.
6210460	6211700	I've been there.
6211700	6215420	Just outside of not gay Wisconsin.
6215420	6218940	I think of it more as flat kiddos.
6218940	6221580	Neurotypical Wisconsin.
6221580	6223700	There are trucks all over that town
6223700	6226220	that say normal police.
6226220	6227220	That's so cool.
6227220	6229780	Nothing to see here, dot com.
6229780	6233500	But so when I met them, I'm a Jewish fagola,
6233500	6237860	12 years older than their beautiful blond son.
6237860	6240460	My parents were communists, et cetera.
6240460	6243100	I don't think they knew that at the time.
6243100	6245580	But I thought that I might be their worst nightmare,
6245580	6246860	frankly.
6246860	6250300	But Keith's dad took me aside and said,
6250300	6252300	we know that you're very special to Keith,
6252340	6253940	so you're very special to us.
6253940	6254940	That's awesome.
6254940	6255940	That was wonderful.
6255940	6258740	I want to fucking die.
6258740	6263100	I hope we can find our way back to that.
6263100	6264860	Those stories over and over again,
6264860	6272140	every time there's a face-to-face encounter,
6272140	6273540	I don't want to publicize anybody.
6273540	6274780	I don't want to out them.
6274780	6277260	I have a family member who they're
6277260	6283300	in a certain neighborhood, and in their neighborhood,
6283300	6287780	there's a guy who's a very popular cool guy,
6287780	6290340	and all the kids play in his yard.
6290340	6291900	And he's like a super cool guy.
6291900	6296700	He's like a stand-up, amazing, cool, neighborhood dad guy.
6296700	6298820	And he has a flagpole in his backyard.
6298820	6303060	And he went off on some trip, and he had a great time,
6303060	6304940	and good for him, and he paid his money.
6304940	6307220	And he came back with this MAGA flag,
6307220	6311100	and he hoisted it up on his backyard flagpole.
6311100	6315420	And this friend of mine that all she
6315420	6319700	could see out her back window was this guy's flag, which
6319700	6321140	is where my story would end.
6321140	6323140	I would just come on this podcast, and I'd go,
6323140	6327900	I live next door to a piece of shit, just fly on this flag.
6327900	6333980	She talked to him and said, which I wouldn't recommend.
6333980	6336740	Suddenly, I'm not on her side for that moment
6336740	6340380	where she goes up to him and goes,
6340380	6344940	that's not really a flag about our country, or our state,
6344940	6345860	or our city.
6345860	6348900	It's a flag about this political platform,
6348900	6351060	and it's like all I can see out my back window,
6351060	6352740	and you're so cool to our kids.
6352740	6357260	And I just, ah, it's right in my face, like out my window.
6357260	6359180	And the guy's response was like, you're right.
6359180	6360100	It's pretty obnoxious.
6360100	6361260	And he took it down.
6361260	6361740	Wow.
6362220	6366780	That's every story, every story.
6366780	6369660	There aren't any stories about actual human beings talking
6369660	6372660	to each other, where then someone pulls out a machete
6372660	6378260	and goes like, I love Trump, or I love socialism.
6378260	6380660	Any time people are talking to each other,
6380660	6385300	it's basically like, what the fuck are you going to do?
6385300	6387620	Well, that's one thing we have to fight our way out of
6387620	6390980	is everybody stereotyping everybody else and having
6390980	6391940	these.
6391940	6394940	That will be the irony of the internet,
6394940	6401660	is we all got connected, and it disconnected all of us,
6401660	6403740	more than we had ever been.
6403740	6408900	Because when we were all just trapped in apartments watching
6408900	6418500	Welcome Back Carter on a TV, our internet was talking
6418500	6421620	to the random stranger that we did laundry
6421620	6423700	with in the shared laundry room.
6423700	6429260	And the internet now tells us, and not unrightfully so,
6429260	6433540	but tells us that guy that's doing laundry with you,
6433540	6438260	he's a much smaller piece of the puzzle.
6438260	6440900	If you're a true crime fan, that guy's
6440900	6445020	going to kill your daughter and eat her.
6445020	6447900	It makes more sense to compartmentalize
6447900	6450220	that person that way.
6450220	6457900	The internet, we thought it was going to end disconnection.
6457900	6462180	And it was like a short circuit.
6462180	6464420	I love that movie.
6464420	6469220	It has revealed to us all that we would rather
6469220	6471980	be who we were yesterday.
6471980	6477380	We would like to take that person that we were yesterday
6477500	6482460	onto the tomorrow of online and say, hey, here's me.
6482460	6484220	Because who wants to dissolve and do
6484220	6486900	a bunch of nothingness of tomorrow?
6486900	6490780	Maybe that's an uplifting thing about us.
6490780	6491980	God damn it, Harmon.
6491980	6493300	Don't waste your.
6493300	6494140	All right.
6494140	6494980	What time is it?
6494980	6496100	Did we do a full podcast?
6496100	6497300	Almost.
6497300	6498900	Let's do a rap?
6498900	6502460	I mean, I'm not saying let's do a rap, but that's the time
6502460	6502960	frame.
6502960	6505100	Would it be tedious and tiresome to just shout out
6505100	6507220	everybody that came from a long distance away?
6507220	6509380	That's what I feel like we owe them.
6509380	6511820	Let's bring all the yahoos.
6511820	6513940	I know we got Sarah and Austin.
6513940	6514900	You guys came.
6514900	6515780	Chico.
6515780	6518100	We got?
6518100	6519620	Where?
6519620	6520780	Salem.
6520780	6522500	Saudi Arabia?
6522500	6523660	For real?
6523660	6525420	And we have England here, too?
6525420	6526940	Yeah.
6526940	6527740	Australia?
6527740	6529380	Australia.
6529380	6530100	Austria.
6530100	6531700	I heard Chicago.
6531700	6533540	How about all at the same time?
6533540	6535100	Portraits.
6535100	6538860	Don't you think there's some way to line people up
6538860	6541740	and just have them saying to a microphone, like,
6541740	6546780	I'm from Melbourne, Australia, and raisins are great.
6546780	6547580	Wait, how about this?
6547580	6548580	Yeah, let's do it.
6548580	6553660	People that came for real, that came from way out of town
6553660	6556700	to come to the show, stand up, and maybe we'll just bring you
6556700	6557980	up, and we'll just all say hello to you.
6557980	6559980	Maybe line up by the staircase by Jeff here.
6559980	6560940	Yeah, just come on up.
6560940	6562140	It's the whole audience.
6562140	6562660	Stand up.
6562660	6564740	I'm going to get the guy with the emperor's shirt.
6565340	6566140	What's up?
6566140	6566740	That's great.
6566740	6567700	Hey, hey, hey.
6567700	6568500	All right.
6568500	6569100	There he is.
6569100	6571620	Yep.
6571620	6574260	It could have been off the stage.
6574260	6576740	Rob, take your mic and interview everybody.
6576740	6577340	Tell them hello.
6577340	6578740	This was your idea, Jeff.
6578740	6581660	You handled this.
6581660	6583100	It's the entire audience.
6583100	6586100	How could this possibly go wrong?
6586100	6587340	I'll come to you, sir.
6587340	6588380	Yeah, where are you from?
6588380	6589380	I mean, this is good.
6589380	6590140	Salem, Oregon.
6590140	6591020	And what's your name?
6591020	6592180	Yeah, you can have a seat.
6592180	6592940	Nathan Jones.
6592940	6593820	Nathan Jones.
6593900	6595940	What's your worst fear?
6595940	6601020	Oh, I guess having my head cut off, but not dying.
6601020	6602740	And so you're just like this, the body's dead.
6602740	6603460	That's a good way.
6603460	6604340	That sounds awesome.
6604340	6606180	But you could, no, but you couldn't do it again.
6606180	6609060	That's like a terrible way to die.
6609060	6610820	I'm sorry, the correct answer was Panthers.
6610820	6611500	Thank you very much.
6611500	6612380	Good to meet you.
6612380	6614500	That was the best worst fear ever.
6614500	6615020	Colorado.
6615020	6617220	Colorado, but not dying.
6617220	6618300	Well, Denver.
6618300	6618940	Denver, Boulder.
6618940	6619820	Denver, Boulder.
6619820	6620860	You guys can't agree on this.
6620860	6622140	You guys from different cities?
6622140	6623060	Yes.
6623740	6626700	What was the worst thing that ever happened to you
6626700	6628780	in Boulder, Colorado?
6628780	6631260	Oh, dear Lord, you don't even want to know.
6631260	6632260	We literally asked.
6635620	6637060	It'll take way too long.
6637060	6639100	Just give us the setting.
6639100	6640500	What was the place?
6640500	6641540	Too many tits out.
6641540	6642420	Too many tits out.
6642420	6645460	Let's give them up for Boulder, Colorado.
6645460	6647220	You sir, you're wearing an Arsenal shirt.
6647220	6649900	Sorry about your shitty team.
6649900	6651060	Are you from London?
6651060	6651820	Yeah, I am, yeah.
6651820	6652500	Are you?
6652820	6654220	Arsenal's blowing it right now.
6654220	6654740	Nice.
6654740	6655260	Shit.
6655260	6656060	Yeah, they're fucking rubbish.
6656060	6658820	They got that shitty coach, and everybody's all shit.
6660820	6666060	If you had one wish, what would it be?
6666060	6668060	Suck up, shitty coach.
6668060	6670780	Suck up, shitty coach.
6670780	6672060	I think he said English.
6672060	6673900	Thank you very much for Arsenal.
6673900	6675380	London, where are you from, sir?
6675380	6676900	Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
6676900	6678660	I love Edmo.
6678660	6682180	What's your favorite bar on White Avenue?
6682180	6683580	Oh, you got to go to the Buckingham.
6683580	6684660	Vegan food.
6684660	6685500	Fuck yeah, I've been there.
6685500	6686140	Yeah, all right.
6686140	6686780	Oh, you're Samson.
6686780	6687820	I met you before.
6687820	6691180	Samson, he's the living reincarnation of Brody Stevens.
6691180	6692060	Let's give him up.
6692060	6693700	Thank you very much.
6693700	6696540	Thank you very much.
6696540	6697060	Eric.
6697060	6698020	Eric, where are you from?
6698020	6698980	Ibiza, Spain.
6698980	6699500	Spain?
6699500	6699820	Yeah.
6699820	6701820	Ibiza.
6701820	6703820	So are you Catalan?
6703820	6704300	No.
6704300	6706300	No, you're Castilla?
6706300	6706900	Also not.
6706900	6708660	I'm German.
6708660	6709660	Get the fuck out of here.
6709660	6710300	Thank you very much.
6710300	6711980	Welcome.
6712020	6712500	Nick.
6712500	6713740	Nick, where are you from, Nick?
6713740	6714500	Bristol, England.
6714500	6715340	Bristol, England.
6715340	6715820	That's correct.
6715820	6717020	What makes Bristol special?
6717020	6720740	What is the claim to fame of Bristol, England?
6720740	6721620	Pirates, I think.
6721620	6722940	Pirates.
6722940	6724820	OK, what's your name over here?
6724820	6726700	Sorry, I'm just curious.
6726700	6727580	What's your name?
6727580	6728460	My name's Jibs.
6728460	6729380	I'm from London.
6729380	6731420	OK, and you love the Hulk?
6731420	6734580	Yeah, he's a pretty cool guy, I guess.
6734580	6735780	Like, because he gets mad, right?
6735780	6737060	And then he turns into the Hulk.
6737060	6739100	He does it better than anyone else.
6739100	6741300	You want to get a selfie?
6742300	6744300	What's your friend of his, or are you just a...
6744300	6745180	Yeah, we met today.
6745180	6746500	OK, what's your name?
6746500	6747220	Yves.
6747220	6748260	Yves?
6748260	6748740	Yeah.
6748740	6749140	OK.
6749140	6749740	It's French.
6749740	6754460	Well, no, that's a bold choice.
6754460	6756940	Are you Lumberjack?
6756940	6757780	No, not yet.
6757780	6761820	No, I'm being racist, but what are you?
6761820	6762820	A software engineer.
6762820	6764660	OK, makes sense.
6764660	6765620	Software engineer.
6765620	6767700	Everybody, we got a star over here.
6767700	6768860	Steven Notley from Edmonton.
6768860	6770140	Oh, Steven Notley!
6770260	6770740	Yeah!
6770740	6773180	Seattle, now.
6773180	6776700	Creator Bob the Angry Flower, one of our favorite comics.
6776700	6780420	Steven, write a haiku for us right now.
6780420	6782140	A haiku is five.
6782140	6783140	Seven, five.
6783140	6791940	A haiku is five syllables and then seven and then five again.
6791940	6792420	Close enough.
6792420	6794220	Guys, give it up for Steven Notley.
6794220	6794820	OK, well.
6794820	6795820	You, sir.
6795820	6797140	It's Edmonton, Alberta.
6797140	6798100	Edmonton, Alberta.

7510620	7511620	Sure.
7511620	7512620	I could.
7512620	7513620	I tried to get the last show.
7513620	7514620	I'm like, that's going to be the worst show.
7514620	7515620	It's going to be the worst.
7515620	7516620	The worst show.
7516620	7519060	Yeah, because I'm just going to not even come.
7519060	7521260	Because they're going to put chairs on the stage.
7521260	7522620	It's going to be the worst show.
7522620	7523620	This is the show.
7523620	7524620	This is the best show.
7524620	7527780	You came to the best one?
