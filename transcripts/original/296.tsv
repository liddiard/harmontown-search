0	22920	Oh yeah. You know what this means? This means that I'm controlling tonight. Let me hear
22920	36760	you say, oh shit. Oh shit. Let me hear you say chill. Ladies and gentlemen,
36760	45680	Harmontown is now in session. Freak out. Thank you so much for coming down to tonight's show.
45680	57480	Let's give it up for our resident dungeon master, Spencer Crittenton. Yes. Look at him.
57480	65800	Look at him sit down with his bag of holding. I got stuff. You got stuff. I got gifts. You got
65800	74160	gifts. Just my presents. Chips. No, no, no. Animated gifts. Animated gifts. Yeah. Well,
74160	79400	you guys are in for a treat tonight. So without any further ado, let's bring out the mayor of
79400	101640	Harmontown. You know him. I love him. Mr. Dan Harm! Thank you. Yes. That was a smooth group we
101640	109120	have. Thank you so much. What an improvement from last week. We filled in some seats. That's nice.
109120	118960	We filled in some. Oh Dan, you didn't have a lot of seats filled last week? Oh yeah. Who wasn't
118960	126360	there? Oh wow. You know Jeff's been out with his vocal surgery. Right, right. So they didn't come
126360	134200	because Jeff wasn't here or somebody else? A lot of our audience is racist. Brandon was controlling,
134200	139920	so that always takes it. We get the racist. Yeah, but I've been here when the place has been packed
139920	146600	and Brandon's here. So I mean, I don't know. I just, what else was missing? All right. I guess
146600	154720	maybe people like you. I have no problem with people liking you. Yeah, you do. I have a problem
154840	165800	with people not liking me, which really is counterintuitive being me. I'm gonna start to
165800	170240	warm up to people liking you. You can come around whenever you want. Thank you for guest
170240	174400	com patrolling. We have some interesting guests to talk to. You were just talking to me right now.
174400	184400	Yeah. You said you were warming up to me. Yeah. I've known you said you were 19. You're warming
184400	192320	up to me. I can come around at any time. What kind of weird kind of talk is that to somebody
192320	199680	who's your best man at your wedding? What are you talking about? You're acting like,
199680	205720	yeah, I guess. It's a compliment. He said he's warming up to you. They don't help him. Do you
205720	214080	guys, are you supposed to suck your gut in all the time? Yeah. Because it feels like that's a lie.
214640	219560	But then people tell you, like fitness people tell you, suck it in because that's like helping.
219560	227920	I've heard that long term sucking in your gut can cause problems because it's like it's stretching
227920	232080	it for way too long. But realistically, you probably won't keep it held for that long.
232080	236360	You'll forget. What you're doing right there is bad for breathing. You're supposed to breathe
236360	240920	from your stomach, not from your chest. If your shoulders go up, that means you're breathing
240920	244680	around. Your belly's supposed to inflate like a balloon. That's good. That's good. Right there.
244680	251120	Right here. Yeah. I went down a weird YouTube spiral. It was like a kind of a red pillish
251120	257200	like a spiral where I was, I was, I can't remember how I ended up there, but I started
257200	262800	learning about posture and there were all these guys that were talking about nerd neck. Like
262800	267640	they're like, like demonstrating. And I'm like, let's see it. Well, like, you know, nerd neck,
267640	272520	I definitely have it. It's like when the 45 degree you're, it has to do it. It starts
272520	277280	with your shoulders moving forward and then has something to do with your head. Like it's
277280	283360	like heavy. So then things like compensate and then you get nerd neck, nerd neck, nerd
283360	288760	neck, nerd neck. So I don't, so that's, so I guess if you just start moving your shoulders
288760	292520	back and sticking your chest out. Yeah. And I was watching all these, these videos that
292520	298880	were about like alpha posture and, uh, and how you're supposed to send a signal. It's
298880	305880	all about fooling women. I guess not fooling them because no one's attacking us. So I guess
305880	310800	it's not a lie if you're like, I'm confident. Cause you might as well be, but, but like it's
310800	317840	a, the idea is to like expose more of your ventral surface to injury, which proves to
317840	322560	the woman unconsciously that you don't have anything to worry about. And that in turn
322560	327840	means like maybe you have more fiefdoms or something like biologically, you know, you
327840	333000	know, these guys, you know, you know, where they end up. That's why the most popular guys
333000	340160	are giant fat guys with targets painted on their bellies. Uh, like that guy in the, in
340160	343800	the stock footage, it gets shot with the cannonball. Right. Exactly. Everyone loves him. That
343800	351320	guy, that guy, you know how that guy died? Drowned in pussy. You were going to say cannonball
351320	359120	shot wound cannonball. That's what you call it. Cannon shot wound. Sure. Did he cried
359120	373000	like after the footage cut, he was just like, and people would like look at him like, man,
373000	377320	get over yourself. You gotta get shot with a cannon and a guy can cry a little. I do
377320	382160	want to know. I want to know. And all right. Yeah. No, those people are being really unreasonable
382160	388200	to judge him for that. Yeah. That stock footage also is, uh, it's, it's, it's public domain.
388200	391880	It's like a high speed camera. Like it's like, cause you see his belly go like, and it's
391880	396240	like, it doesn't look, I mean, he looks like a large man, but does he really look like
396240	401560	someone who's, who's, who's wheel house is getting shot? You know, like, like he doesn't,
401560	406040	I wonder if they're just like, it was basically just like a, like a, you know, they put a
406040	409440	little bit of explosive behind a cannonball because they were really excited about the
409440	413120	camera. Yeah. Like it was like a myth busters thing. Like I want your belly like jiggle.
413120	418320	I heard that he's actually laying on a table and they dropped the bowling ball on, on his
418320	424120	stomach. It was the first use of green screen. Yeah. Oh, how do you practice for that? How
424120	429080	do you warm up? Do you think they just started with like a small cannonball and just worked
429080	433320	their way up or how did, how do you practice? How do you, do you do something? Here's a
433320	439120	wacky idea. Look at that cannon. How about you shoot me? Let me take my shirt off first.
439120	442880	He took his shirt off. Why are you taking his shirt off? Like we're going to go, you probably
442880	447640	got some cardboard underneath there. What was I thinking about for the other, something
447640	451480	I was watching and I was like, how do you practice this without dying? And I can't remember
451480	455840	what it was. Tie your rope walking. You get the net underneath you. Yeah, that's a good
455840	460240	problem. You don't die. Train eating. You can probably use a thicker rope. It probably
460240	464600	starts as like, like the rope is like as thick as like a barrel. Like you do just. Here's
464600	472000	that. Here's it. Two ropes. Two ropes. They probably start you on two ropes. Yeah. Remember
472000	476200	that guy that was the French guy that walked between the world trade center and just went
476200	481320	up there and just did it. Yeah. After he stepped on a nail. How the fuck does this, I don't
481320	485280	understand if the wind blows, you're just dead. Yeah, I don't get that. It just wasn't
485280	489280	a windy, wasn't a windy day. And then they use it. And then there's, there's solution
489280	495400	to that as they bring out a giant stick. That's like, it's like, isn't this just making problems
495400	500080	to solve? Like, like, like, like, like, like if you lose the stick because, because like,
500080	502800	what are you doing with the stick? Oh, well, you know, a little bit of this, a little bit
502800	508040	of that. Like, like, like, like, well, I would lose the stick, but I guess that's why, uh,
508040	514800	you know, I'm not a tightrope walker. No, I'm just a fucking thin. Yeah. Uh, uh, alpha
514800	526080	necked, uh, uh, death Valley t-shirt booze, swilling cowboy. Yeah. Oh, Spencer, what are
526080	533560	you've been doing lately? Doing any, um, doing anything lately? Oh yeah. I was at comic con.
533560	538160	Did you get recognized? Yay. I got recognized. It's weird. I, I clocked how many times I
538160	542720	got recognized and how many times I, uh, just got like a, Hey, how long you've been growing
542720	548680	that beard? And it was like about the same, which was interesting. How many times of each,
548680	556160	uh, about six on, uh, the highest day, like you're like a human beard. Yeah. You're interchangeable
556160	561000	with your beard. You you're, yeah. It's so strange. Like people really just go, Oh yeah,
561000	565600	the beard. That's something I'm allowed to like talk to you about. Except can I give
565600	572720	you a little cynical fame one on one from the cynical heartland? Yeah. Yeah. About 30%
572720	577040	of those people that are talking to you about your beard. They know what's up. They know
577040	581120	what's up there. They're playing itself because they're like, Oh, I don't want to be a fan.
581120	584960	I would like, that would be interesting. So they'll buy you a drink and then they'll talk
584960	587800	to you about the economy. And then on their way out, they'll be like, by the way, big
587800	594760	fan. What you fucker. Yeah. I thought you were a nice person. Yeah. You know how like
594760	599640	Pat and Oswald and, and like Brian Cranston, like they wear the mask and they walk through
599640	603960	so they could be with the people in the comic, I thought there's the Spencer put on just
603960	609640	a mask with the beard and not change anything else. I think you would still be recognizable.
609640	613320	Like if you're dressed as like ghost writer, Mark Hamill, uh, dressed as a stormtrooper
613320	620320	and I thought that was cute. No, I didn't see that. Oh, it's funny because he referenced
620320	624200	like, you know, he's like, I know I'm a little short for this costume. It's cute. He referenced
624200	629680	that. He referenced, he referenced that. He referenced the line from Star Wars where
629680	633720	he enters Princess Leia. He just kept saying that over and over. No, he's in his, in his
633720	639720	Instagram. I mean, that's asking to be going, you're out. I like, I like Mark Hamill. I
639720	643600	don't know if I ever mentioned this on this podcast, but I, I like when we were, I think
643600	648120	I must've, when we were doing a community and we were picking, like, you know, we ended
648120	652800	up with Louise Guzman as the statue in the courtyard and we were going through people
652800	656000	like, well, there should be a statue of someone in the courtyard. I must've talked about this.
656000	659960	I don't know. One of the, one of the people was the proposals was what about Mark Hamill?
659960	664760	Cause he's like, it's like he's Luke Skywalker, but he's Mark Hamill. And like, what if he
664760	670640	was like the sort of like statue, he was the most famous alumnus of the, of, of Greendale.
670640	674960	And I, and I, and I sent him an email or I think, I don't think I sent him an email.
674960	680760	I think the charming thing was that I got a, like a hand typed letter from him in response
680760	686760	to a casting director reaching out to him. So I was the schmuck, the, the, the cigar
686760	693240	chomping, get me Mark Hamill. And, and, and, and got this like lovingly crafted letter
693240	697680	from Mark Hamill that was like, dear Dan Harmon, pleased to meet you. I'm Mark Hamill.
697680	704120	And I shit my pants and then keep reading the letter. And he's like, I'm so flattered.
704120	709680	I got the script. It's very funny. And, and, and, but, you know, I think we both know the
709680	713720	jokes on me a little bit. Like he, he wasn't defensive about it. It wasn't like Gene Simmons'
713720	718760	interview with Terry Gross. It was like, it was like Mark Hamill, like he got, he kind
718760	722800	of called us on it. He was sort of like, yeah, the joke is kind of like I'm a schmuck, you
722800	727760	know, like, and it's, I do agree. It's funny, but also like, I kind of like, I'm not ready
727760	732400	to just be like that yet or something like that. He just explained it very concisely
732400	737360	and very, very politely and empathically. And then it was like, also I'm a director.
737360	744400	So if you want to give me a serious job, fucking asshole. And I was, I was, I actually, Mark
744400	752280	Hamill wrote me a letter. Did you save it? Come on. You know, you move, you move, you
752280	758200	meet people, you say hello, you say goodbye, yada, yada, you know. Our first guest is
758200	764440	just sort of a surprise. I found this, this, this kid like out in the alley, like, like
764440	771640	LA is like, it's a wasteland of talent. Like, too much people, people come here. They come
771640	777640	here on a carpet of dreams. They, they sell the carpet. They sell shoes. They got some
777640	782840	dreams, dream shakens. They sell watermelon on the side of the road, fruits and vegetables.
782840	785800	You've seen these people. Yeah. You've seen these people selling things.
788280	792120	Let's, let's, let's bring, let's bring out this poor kid, Jeff Davis. Jeff Davis.
808120	810440	You, you.
816840	822760	So, Jeff, I, I heard his, this terrible story out of the alley. Like he's just had vocal
822760	830120	surgery. So he's drinking hot tea and he can't talk that much yet. So that's why he's not,
830120	834840	normally I just make a kid from the alley a comptroller. You did.
838360	842680	I'm just here to listen tonight, Dan. Okay. You got to eat that mic.
845800	851480	Yeah. I'm, I'm already paying for myself, Dan.
853720	857800	Can we hear a little bit about, I've never known a human being. So Jeff, Jeff.
857800	866920	I've never known a human being. I've known, they known lizards and crustaceans. I only know ghosts
866920	872840	and minotaurs. I've never known a human being. You sir, will be his first human being.
875240	882920	Make it good. Uh, what is it? What is it like to not be able to talk for two weeks, three weeks?
882920	888040	It was two weeks of total vocal silence. What did you, because of what you, what did you have?
888040	894840	I had a polyp on one of my, I think my left vocal fold and there's a tiny little P like,
894840	900760	not even a P shape. Like, like if a P grew peas, that's what the P would look like. And it was a
900760	904040	very tiny little thing. And I had some doctors go down in my throat and they were very good. And
904040	909240	I was like asleep for like an hour and a half. And they, did you wake up during, during the,
909240	914760	and see if they were talking shit about you? I woke up and I was just covered in dicks and balls
914760	921160	drawings. Oh yeah. Rob woke up during his colonoscopy. How did you pronounce that?
921160	926120	Hey, Colin? When he cut open your colon.
926920	931720	Didn't you go in with Colin Hanks and get an endoscopy? Yeah. That's a colonoscopy when they
931720	935880	start with him. I go, this is his throat. It's a colonoscopy. I don't think my insurance is going
935880	941880	to cover this. Uh, you kind of sounded like Colin Hanks when he said that. I sounded who?
941880	945720	I don't think there's insurance. You kind of sounded like Colin Hanks. I wasn't trying to.
945720	950840	No, that's good. Oh no, I'm sorry. I'm doing a terrible job. Yeah, Rob woke up during his colon
950840	955480	oscopy. And we've already told this. All right. Well, yeah, we told every story all the time. What
955480	959160	do you want? We got, we got a couple things that are, that we haven't talked about. Keep talking.
959160	964040	One is a shooting and the other is a dear friend that departed. Since I couldn't talk. I threw up
964040	974120	on my groceries. Go ahead. I'm not going to be able to butt in tonight. You guys, I have,
974120	980120	you guys, you guys do all the talking. I was just going to say that since I was able to talk,
980120	985320	this amazing story happened to me, which I cannot tell you because I'm on vocal rest.
987880	994520	I really hope it doesn't get Church in trouble that, because I heard, because it's such a funny
994520	1001160	joke that, uh, I think he got to Dino and then Dino told it to me. Dino said, Church says
1002040	1005800	that even though Jeff can't talk at all, he still figures out ways to interrupt her.
1005800	1009160	It's because I'm a showman.
1012120	1019800	Um, speaking of, of the glass ceiling and, uh, uh, and, and, and alpha neck.
1021080	1022520	You get that? Is that the glass ceiling?
1023800	1024520	Put it on, put it on.
1024520	1028200	It looks so, it looks like it looks so practical. I always imagined it being more oppressive.
1029800	1031800	Oh, it's like, uh, you can wear it like a helmet.
1031800	1032840	That will happen.
1038280	1040120	Thanks. Expect you to die.
1042360	1044280	Does this sound as cool as it sounds?
1044280	1045480	Yeah, it sounds awesome.
1049000	1052040	Rob's holding a plexiglass container on his head.
1055080	1057480	I was going to say, speaking of, it's a trash can.
1058440	1058920	Yeah, yeah.
1061000	1064200	I was going to say, well, why don't I just bring her out and I want to bring her out and, uh,
1064200	1069160	I, I, I, it's my chance to do my Don Pardo impression. Uh, he was an announcer in the
1069160	1073160	seventies on SNL. Please welcome Lorraine Newman.
1073880	1085080	Thanks for coming.
1089720	1091160	It's been a rough week.
1091160	1092120	It has, yeah.
1092680	1097080	We were talking backstage about it. I, I, I, I, I, I hazarded a guess, but without realizing
1097080	1101480	that, of course you, you knew him, cause you were on, uh, metal, metalocalypse, uh, that we lost
1101480	1105160	our friend, John Schnapp. I don't know how many of you are familiar with them. We're in LA.
1109880	1114360	What kind of host brings you out and then just drops that on you? I don't know. How are you doing?
1114360	1122440	Happy days. I'm doing great. Okay, so let's talk about our dead friend. Okay, no, I just like,
1123720	1128360	I wanted to eulogize them a little bit because I haven't, I always feel like sociopathic when,
1128360	1138520	I don't know, like I remember the color of the floor when I found out that he had just
1138520	1144280	boom like crazy stroke. It does feel like life turns on a dime because I was just saying that
1144280	1150040	I saw hereditary with him three weeks ago. And then there's this tremendous guilt. Now you're
1150040	1158040	talking about someone in the past tense and but I think it's just everything about it feels awful.
1158040	1163000	So I don't know where I thought that was podcasting dynamite, but I also don't know what my job is.
1164920	1169560	But just because, you know, I see people's Instagrams and stuff and I just wanted to lend
1169560	1173400	our voice to his eulogy. I think that there's some people when they die, it's like, yeah,
1173960	1180360	but with him, I think that's important to acknowledge. You're right. I can't believe
1180360	1186120	that he passed away. He was so, you know, just vibrant and, you know, but so that's,
1186120	1191320	I think, the difference. He was such a, I mean, I think he epitomized workaholism, right? I mean,
1191320	1197240	this is a city driven by workaholics. And I'm trying to get over that therapy. But like John
1197240	1204680	was John was both cautionary tale and and and role model. And I mean, he just he just he just
1204680	1209320	kept working and working. And he just loved sitting in front of his avid and like making
1209320	1218040	crazy shit. And like every anecdote about him from Adult Swim to everywhere else he's worked
1218040	1223720	as like an editor, like, like every anecdote is about coming into the office at 9am. And he's
1223720	1228040	been there all night and he's created some ridiculous elaborate thing that they can't
1228040	1234040	even use in the show. He's a consummate artist. I mean, really, he really lived to create art.
1234840	1239080	So yeah, we love you, John. I hope you're listening. I hope that's how the universe works.
1239320	1244680	Unless unless that's all it is, unless you're just vapor listening to podcast. That's awful.
1245400	1251160	That then then signed me up for atheism. It's just listening to shit in your local area for
1251800	1256360	forever. Oh, and then the plant, the whole planet goes away. And you're just like, hello.
1258040	1261080	And you can't even hear the other people you can't even look forward to your friends.
1261080	1263400	You only just get the intros to the podcast.
1264440	1267720	Just the intros or people vamp for 20 minutes and you want to kill yourself.
1270200	1272120	Yeah, we don't know what that's like at all.
1275320	1282200	Yeah, on the off chance that you're listening, John, I guess I part and parcel of it is it's
1282200	1285800	narcissistic to feel guilty about like, Oh, I didn't talk to you enough. I wasn't, I wasn't
1285800	1290360	close enough and all that stuff, but whatever. I don't think it's narcissistic. It's just kind
1290360	1298280	of regret. Yeah. That we don't value people while they're here. No, I'm, I'm, I'm totally
1298280	1302440	kidding. And it really wasn't worth it. Well, if you, well, if you weren't kidding,
1302440	1305320	what would you have meant? Would that would have been a dire warning to me or a, uh,
1307640	1311560	I know things, Dan. I know. It sounded like a threat.
1312600	1316520	I think she was saying that you didn't value John while he was here. And that's your
1316520	1321480	giant blunder in life. Yeah. I mean, I, I have a feeling I make that blunder with just about
1321480	1329080	everybody. I mean, Rob, certainly. Yeah, there he goes. No, I've just learned to appreciate,
1329080	1333560	you know, I'll, I'll just think of someone and I'll text them that I'm thinking of them.
1334280	1338440	And that in itself, I think you text the memory of the, no, well, not,
1341240	1344280	in terms of, you know, acknowledging people while they're here,
1345160	1349400	you know, I think it's just so nice to do that now. Your texts are usually you up.
1350360	1353320	Uh, yeah. Well, just to you, honey.
1354840	1359800	Thank you. Um, yeah. I have started a new policy about, uh, do that. Like, like, because the,
1360360	1364280	the, the, the, the positive version of your, of your friends unexpectedly passing is
1365000	1370040	in this town, your friends blow up. They like become super famous. They, they're, they're like
1370040	1374680	on the cover of time magazine or something one day. And the other day you were like having coffee
1374680	1380360	with them. And like, I, I feel like our instinct, probably not yours. You seem like, uh, you're
1380360	1386200	more grounded. Oh, I'm a saint. Um, but you're in my instinct used to be like, well, they don't
1386200	1390600	want to, you know, last thing they need is some schlub texting them and saying, remember it back
1390600	1394680	here. Yeah. But that's so valuable to them. Yeah. And it's like, also like, what if they get,
1394680	1398840	if they get nominated for something or something, it's like, it's like, oh, the idea that they don't
1398920	1404280	want you to it's that's, that's so narcissistic. Like that's just ego. Like, oh, they don't want
1404280	1409800	to hear me saying good job on that music video. It's afraid of being vulnerable. Yeah. Because
1409800	1414360	you don't want to, you don't want the silence to, yeah. Yeah. But I think any chance to acknowledge
1414360	1420120	people under your appreciation of their work is not wasted and it's not about you. You know,
1420120	1427160	you don't look foolish. You don't look, um, you're not open to some sort of, you know, put down just
1427160	1431320	because you've acknowledged, you know, a congratulations to someone or something like
1431320	1443080	that. Do you, have you, have you coped with, uh, whatever. Have you, have you, you're like,
1443080	1449320	I'm carving out your grim, like, like, Dan, you've given me a sandbox of cat turds to play with. I
1449320	1454520	made it Sanadu and now you're going to knock it over when they're like, good job. All I'm trying
1454520	1460840	to say is, um, don't be too cool to let people know that you appreciate. Yeah. And I just got
1460840	1468680	that now. Like I, I, I, so I can, like six months. I got that. So I could start texting you again.
1469320	1473800	Yeah. I mean, it's nice to hear from you. Yeah. Good. It'd be good to hear.
1474600	1477000	I'm warming up to you. I told you at the top of the show.
1477000	1485240	Oh, am I a mute? Is that, did you mute my, my handle? No, you were so busted.
1487000	1494040	I have you, have you, have you, where are you at with mortality? I'm sorry. I keep handing you
1494040	1501480	these gems. I'm for mortality. Well, that's a safe, safe bet. I'm four days away.
1501480	1510440	I just kind of, I get it to you. I can't talk a lot. So my jokes have to be short and stupid.
1513080	1517560	Where am I with mortality? Yeah. You push it to the, I have complete denial about it. Oh,
1517560	1522280	good. That's refreshing. Thank you. Yeah. I just, I'm never, I'm, I'm not going to die. I'm not going
1522280	1528200	to get old, even though I hurt like hell every morning. And what could that, what's wrong? Oh,
1528200	1533400	you're old. You know what? Can we enter a unique friendship where we back each other up on this?
1533400	1538440	You're never going to die, Lorraine Newman. I fucking got your back. Like, like now lie to me
1538440	1543480	and let's be best friends about this. We're going to be the ones, the exceptions. Yeah. Cause you
1543480	1550280	know, yeah, science every day, science with the science. And what a joy it would be to hang out
1550280	1558840	here forever. A dynasty typewriter. Oh, sure. Well, yeah. That's an interesting question. Would
1558840	1568280	you accept immortality if you could, within a perimeter of 500 feet for, if you could be like,
1568280	1573080	just, I'm going to live forever, but everyone has to come visit me. Yes, but I'm, I'm at Bev Mo.
1573080	1581320	And they're like pushing the decision and you're like, you, this offer is available for the next
1581320	1587720	14 minutes. Either you're going to die of prostate cancer at a random time or you're going to live
1587720	1593880	forever here at Bev Mo. Within five minutes. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds like hell. I think I would,
1593880	1597640	I would, you would, you would pass it up, right? You'd go like, okay, I can't, I've seen enough
1597640	1601960	movies to know. Haven't you seen the vampires? They get tired. They get bored. They get lonely.
1602040	1607400	They're tired of seeing people they love get old and die. I would want to ask, can I kill myself
1608200	1612360	to the person? Because I don't know if vampires can't, can they? Oh yeah.
1614920	1619320	Hey guys. They just, they just don't, they just walk outside. Well, yeah, if they can't, they just go,
1619320	1625880	yeah. Yeah. If vampires couldn't commit suicide, then the sunlight thing wouldn't be, yeah. Yeah,
1625880	1629400	yeah. Because they, anytime someone dragged him out into the sunlight, they could just go, my idea,
1629400	1635400	my idea. Yeah. And then, and then they, they, they proved against it. I want this. I want it,
1635400	1639880	Van Hill saying. I think this is great. You're not cool. Is there ever, is there, I don't watch
1639880	1644760	enough like vampire stuff, but do vampires commit suicide by walking outside? Is that a thing? Oh,
1644760	1649880	yeah. Yeah, but then, you know, I mean the whole lore has gotten so, you know, uh, blown up that
1649880	1655560	they can reconstitute themselves. I mean, you name it. Yeah. They just don't die. Sounds like somebody
1655560	1661000	has daughters. The strain. Did you see the strain? No, I didn't see the strain. It was anybody.
1661000	1667320	No, that was crazy. Hey, Lorraine, have you watched Blade? Blade? Yeah. I love Blade.
1667320	1673400	Pretty fucking badass, right? Yeah, it's great. He walks around in the day. He's, he's the day
1673400	1679400	walker. He's half human. He's half human. Can you do, for me, Rob, because you're a comptroller. Oh,
1679400	1684760	my God. Would you please do your Chris Christopherson as, was his name Whistler? Whistler. Whistler.
1684760	1689880	Could you give me one line as Chris Christopherson as Blade's sidekick in Blade? Well,
1689880	1695880	I can't imagine what line that would be. Did I get you fuckers in a bad time?
1702760	1706280	What movie was it that I saw? I saw Blade. Blade. It was from Blade.
1708040	1712680	I saw two vampire, I think it was like a vampire couple, and they, they held hands and they sat on
1712680	1716840	a beach and they watched the sunrise together and they, because they wanted to die. God, was it that
1716840	1724200	one with, um, Stephen Dorff? No, no, not Stephen Dorff. Uh, that's Blade. That's Blade. And that's
1724200	1731720	the one with Wesley Snipes. Thank you. Oh, sorry, what? Only lovers left alive. Only lovers left
1731720	1741720	alive. I, I'm that, is that Cinemax? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Maybe I saw, I mean, I've seen a lot of
1741720	1747480	crap. Like I, I, I, I might've forgot the title, but, and it might've happened in two vampire movies.
1747480	1752280	What was the one where, uh, what's the, where, uh, what's his name? Stephen, uh, the other,
1752280	1759400	the other guy, he was... Deacon Frost? What? No, the other guy, the guy, and he's in the,
1759400	1764120	wait, is it also Stephen Dorff? Like, is he in a vampire movie where in the future everyone's a
1764120	1769640	vampire? Oh, that's Day, Day Trippers? Daybreak. Yes. Who's that? Who's that guy? Ethan Hawke.
1769640	1775160	Ethan Hawke. Sorry, Ethan. Ethan Hawke. Stephen Dorff and Ethan, Ethan Hawke are easy to
1775160	1779880	confuse. Yeah. I mean, and I think they'd both be flattered by that. Yes. I think they'd both
1779880	1782840	simultaneously go. I think, I think. That's what I'm going for. And then they go, huh, ha.
1787400	1793720	I think Stephen Dorff gets the better of that deal. I agree. Shots, shots fired. Yeah. Fuck
1793720	1798600	that guy. Again, Stephen Dorff. Okay. I've got, I've got no vampire in this race. I don't really
1798600	1804920	care. Well, in, in, in that movie, we learned that you can be cured of vampirism because if you,
1804920	1811320	daylight will kill you, but no one ever thought of this. If you drive a car really fast and then
1811320	1817400	you smash through the windshield into daylight, but shortly after, while you're still on fire,
1818120	1824760	you land in water, you're cured. What? That's the first thing I would try. No, that's the first
1824840	1831080	thing every vampire would ever try. What, what, what, what? I haven't seen this movie. That's
1831080	1837080	called science. That's every, every day. Curing vampirism easier than escaping killer bees.
1839000	1842280	There's shit you're not even allowed to do when you're running for bees that you could do if
1842280	1847400	you're a dying vampire. That'll give you immortality or mortality, I guess is what they're after. What
1847400	1852280	does the car and the windshield have to do with helping? Yeah. Why is it gotta have a windshield
1852280	1856520	involved? Why can't you? It's a future where the vampires drive around during the day and they have
1856520	1862440	like blackout, UV blackout, teslas that like you only use the cameras to get around. So you can,
1862440	1869000	you can go meet mortals under a tree in the shade and hatch schemes. But then the vampire
1869000	1872920	cops who have like head to toe body armor to shield them from the sun will come out and go
1873880	1880520	furious. And then, but then he finds out quite on accident. Like, yeah,
1882360	1887480	there's a show called eye zombie, which I really loved where somebody got cured of being a zombie.
1887480	1892600	Do you remember that? I don't know how they did it. You got to be in the trunk of that car. What
1892600	1900280	a vampire. Exactly. Have you seen Santa Clarita diet? You ever watch that? I tried. Yeah. Well,
1900360	1906040	give it another shot. Yeah. Well, here I, can I tell you the, I'm a snob, the pilot, I was like,
1907560	1909400	and I, but then like,
1911880	1915960	Cody was up for a job on it. So she was at the watch the whole season. And I was just like,
1915960	1921160	my hands were tied. That shit got funny. Like, it just got, it just got really like the characters
1921160	1927720	got really funny. Oh, I'm excited. I got something to watch. I'm excited to wire. I always judge shows
1927720	1931400	too early. I judge them by their first season of their pilot. I stopped watching preacher for
1931400	1937800	that reason. Mr. Robot. I was like, you mean fight club, please. Then I walked away and then I hear
1937800	1942520	everybody going, what the fuck's going on over here? I'm like, come on that fight club show.
1944040	1950280	Turns out that's what they were doing on purpose or something. Uh, Fargo. I'd watch the first one.
1950280	1960520	I was like, you're just doing Fargo. More like, more like far you turned it off. Never watched
1960520	1969480	again. It's so good. Yeah. Yeah. You got to give it a shot. All right. Well, too late now. Still
1969480	1975240	haven't seen Atlanta still Atlanta. You haven't seen now. I see I'm fucking on the worst. Well,
1975240	1980600	I've seen it in Emmy, Emmy submissions and it's, it's great, but I don't watch it. I like crime
1980600	1989320	drama and horror. Crime. What about crime? Nonfiction, forensic files. Okay. What kind of horror?
1990840	1999160	Everything except kind of found footage. Yeah. Did you see that sound boogens? Pardon me. I call
1999160	2006760	it the sound boogens that, uh, in a quiet place. A quiet place. Well, they got, they got the sound
2006760	2013800	boogens running around. I saw sound boogens. Yeah. It's good, man. It's good. I mean, if nobody,
2013800	2018520	if I could definitely see why everyone on earth that told me it was the best movie ever
2019160	2023320	said that is because everyone on earth hadn't told them it was the best movie ever. I just like
2023320	2028200	saying sound boogens. If my doctor told me that's one of the nicest sounds you can say when you're
2028200	2038920	recovering from vocal surgery. Cellar door. Sound boogens. Stairway nail. So what about
2038920	2043080	hereditary everybody? What do you think? I haven't seen hereditary yet, but I hear it. I heard it was
2043080	2051240	fucked up. Wow. Have you seen it? No. I recommend it. I didn't mean to sound so, I sounded like a,
2051320	2058840	like a puppet on some show teaching you manners. No. No. I'm Daniel Crabtree.
2060760	2065800	It's, you know what, what's amazing about it is once you realize what the story is,
2065800	2072040	it's like, oh, well, movies about this have been made before, but not like this.
2072040	2076200	Is this a movie or a show? Hereditary is a movie. Okay. Yeah. All right. Well,
2076200	2083880	I guess don't spoil it. Come on. Who likes that movie? Yeah. Who hates that movie? Who? One guy.
2083880	2092680	Oh, one guy. That's fair. Lorraine, do you like Pinhead? In Hellraiser? Yeah. I hate,
2092680	2098600	I hate the Clive Barker stuff. Oh. It bores me to death. Oh, even the, even the, even the first
2098600	2105480	Pinhead? Well, that's, I never got past that one. Well, here's the, here's the trick that's on you,
2105480	2112200	Lorraine. When you watch a Clive Barker movie and you hate it, your suffering is your pleasure.
2112200	2121240	Yeah. Yeah. That's what he wants. I got that far. I know that reference. It's a waste of good
2121240	2129480	suffering. Everything opposite will be opposite to what you call torture. I call a chicken palm
2129480	2140040	sandwich. Chains in my flesh is such ecstasy. What? What are you talking about? When we were on
2140040	2146440	ghost, when we were on ghosted, like Ryan Ridley and I would giggle, like we would do impressions
2146440	2156600	of Pinhead as done by Ted Knight. They would be like, oh, oh, oh, oh, this is a biggie. He's just
2156600	2162520	like, oh, we'll tear your soul apart, Monroe. That kind of stuff. Nobody here knows who you're
2162520	2171880	talking about. Ted Knight. Yeah. The only 55 year old. Frank Knight is in the house. When was he
2171880	2177400	knighted? Dumb. All right. No, that was good. Look, secret, secret to dad jokes. You don't have
2177400	2183880	to have a kid. You turn 45 and they start fucking, I just make puns all day lately. It's like a rash.
2183880	2194520	Do you read signs too? Out loud in the car? Yeah. And then twist them into puns. Custer, yogurt,
2194520	2201160	more like... No, dads don't get that far. No, they just go like... They just be driving around. They go,
2202600	2213800	norms. Chick-fil-A. Dollar general. Maybe not by myself, but I'm assuming there's someone else
2213800	2224680	in the car. Who's hardware? They really be like that though. Dads. It's true.
2229800	2235720	What were you telling me about the James Franklin Jamestown thing? Oh, well, here's another reference
2235720	2243000	nobody'll know. Does anybody know who Lucille Ball was? Yeah. Well, her hometown is Jamestown.
2243800	2248760	Upstate New York, Buffalo. And they approached her when she was still living obviously and said,
2248760	2255160	we want to do a museum dedicated to you. And she said, I would much prefer if you do a museum
2255160	2263880	celebrating comedy. Wow. So the National Comedy Center was built. They started on it eight years
2263880	2272520	ago and I took a tour a week ago and it is mind blowing. If anybody's a comedy nerd, you will weep.
2272520	2279320	It's absolutely Mecca. What town in New York is that? Like a bigger town is the Jamestown mirror?
2280040	2285640	I don't know because I am from the West Coast and I do not know my way around there. I'm going to
2285640	2289480	be up there not too long. Buffalo is the biggest... Yeah, I'll be near there. I'd like to go see that.
2289480	2293640	Oh, you got to check it out. Yeah, and there's a big opening. It's funny, Harmontown was never asked
2293640	2300440	to... Pardon me? To contribute? We still haven't been inducted. Yeah.
2301240	2307400	I mean this chair alone. Yeah, I got a Harmontown question as I normally sort of... These still
2307400	2313400	suck. Yeah. They're the worst. They're so uncomfortable. I've been saying it for years
2313400	2318440	and they're still here. What do you want to say? We're guests here. It's a fine theater. You want us
2318440	2323800	to start asking for... We'd have to provide our own. I feel like we brought these chairs. Yes,
2323800	2328760	because they were at the castle. And then you cut to just these really comfortable chairs in the
2328760	2336840	alley that we threw out. That's awesome. Lorraine Newman. Conehead stories go. Conehead stories go.
2339240	2347080	All right. This one's called Conehead stories. Take it away. Okay, well, one time we wanted to
2347080	2352280	kill off the Coneheads and send them back to Remulac, so we did some actual outside filming
2352280	2358600	where Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin and I were in a convertible, of course, and we were just driving
2358600	2365880	around, I think, New Jersey or something. And the thing that they attached the Cone with
2366520	2372680	was something that's not used anymore called spirit gum. And we'd only been in it for like
2372680	2377880	five minutes when we did a sketch, but this was like several hours and it started to burn
2377880	2385560	like fuck. And I think I'm not speaking out of school when I say that Danny and Jane
2385560	2391800	smoked weed to deal with the pain. They can take the hit. Their careers can take it. Yeah.
2391800	2395640	I think TMZ is here tonight. That's probably whose phone rang. Oh, dear God.
2397080	2402600	Well, Jane and Jane can take it. Yeah, I mean, Jane is still waters. I heard he called her
2402600	2409000	an ignorant slut once. He did. But I mean, when the Stones. TMZ out to the street.
2410680	2415080	When the Rolling Stones hosted our show, Jane Curtin's dressing room was next to mine,
2415080	2420440	and I remember opening the door and Jane was in a bathrobe and curlers smoking and Mick Jagger
2420440	2427080	was there. Just the two of them. It's like this. He should be in my dressing room. Why is he?
2428520	2432520	She hasn't sunk in for me that it's just legal now. Isn't it just legal? It's sort of like in
2432520	2437080	this whole fracas. Like, I mean, I had a medical card and I would go talk to the guy with the pony
2437080	2443000	tail on this deathoscope and like pretend I had sleep apnea. You know, it's not legal in New York.
2443800	2448840	Because my my older child was complaining. She wanted some edibles. She was freaking out because
2448840	2455080	she had bed bugs. And she was sure that she was finding them all over the house. It was kind of
2455080	2459720	like coke bugs. Right. But she said, God, I could use some edibles. I said, Go out and get some.
2460600	2466440	It's illegal in New York. And I had no idea. Because you're like, it always seemed legal
2466520	2475400	when I was your aunt. I think we got a little sidetracked from the cone head story.
2477080	2482040	Did you ever keep shit? Is there is the cone hollow is the cone head? Well, it's
2483400	2489320	it's not hollow, but it is firm. And well, I've officially become Regis Philbin. I don't remember.
2490120	2495480	What do you put in there? Is the cone hollow? You put things in there? Scotch tea. I put an omelet.
2497400	2501800	Was there like another act of the spirit gum story when you were all burning to death?
2501800	2508760	That was it. You know, we didn't need to pump gas at one point, which is fun. Do you remember back
2508760	2515880	when the cone head movie was coming out and we at Comedy Sports had to wear cone heads and we played
2515880	2522280	the game Dr. Kona because we were that Comedy Sports was hoping we would get on a local commercial.
2523080	2525400	Do you remember that? That was so sad. Tell that story.
2527080	2532840	Like Paramount did the cone heads movie. And yeah, the part of the promotion was that they
2532840	2536200	sent cone heads. I mean, I'm kind of just repeating what you said, but we worked in
2536200	2540440	Comedy Sports. Well, you know, like back in the commercials where they would go,
2540440	2547240	we loved it. Yeah, they were wearing a cone head or something. And so our comedy club took it. They
2547320	2554280	were like, oh, that means that we could get some promotion. Like, no, they're not. That's so sad.
2555000	2559000	We like perverted our show to like, like instead of we used to play Dr. Know-It-All, you know,
2559000	2562920	that theater sports game or Mr. Know-It-All where you do three people and then you answer one word
2562920	2569320	at a time. Let's do a round. Hey, somebody asked a question. I heard, why is the sky blue? You fucking
2569400	2573800	slow pokes. Here's the thing. It doesn't matter what the fucking question is.
2575880	2584200	The sky is blue. Okay. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
2584200	2590600	Go ahead. No, why would you go from here to here? Make it. It's my fault. You go. You go.
2590600	2602440	I was thinking of you as the referee. All right. Okay. He's going to get the
2602440	2609080	suggestions from the audience. Anyways, so our little improv troupe, like they changed the name
2609080	2615800	for that six month period to Dr. Conehead. So we all had to wear cone heads because the idea was that
2616680	2620760	that we could send the tapes that they religiously taped every show from the back of the sound.
2620760	2625080	And we hated it. Oh, good. Those tapes. Look, we just tape in a black box theater. Yeah. Where
2625080	2630840	was this done? Milwaukee. Oh, and we hated it. And so we would go out of our way to
2630840	2637480	screw it up. So the footage would be unusable. Yeah. Diabolical. I can't remember what we did.
2637880	2641080	Do you wear the cone? I don't know. I think it was just like
2643560	2649080	just doing terrible. I mean, like soon after that, you and I were not allowed on stage together.
2649080	2654120	Yeah. Yeah. Rob and I were forbidden to be on stage together.
2656440	2663000	It's kind of a fun part of our friendship. I guess like we're too powerful comedically.
2663000	2664840	That's how we chose to look at it.
2667000	2671960	Somebody might burst into flames. Yeah. Comedy fire. Yeah. Do you have any like
2672840	2678840	when you were doing like just improv like on like what stuff were you doing before SNL? Like what
2678840	2684840	kind of crazy stuff? I was part of this improv workshop. And from that workshop, we formed the
2684840	2694920	Groundlings. Yeah. You were a foundling. I'm a foundling. Who is in your truth? Okay.
2694920	2700840	Here's the original people and nobody here is going to know who these people are. Tim Matheson.
2700840	2709720	Yes. Pat Morita. Yeah. Yeah. Jack Su. Doesn't know that. Oh, okay. And Valerie Curtin, who was
2709720	2715080	married to Barry Levinson and his writing partner at the time. And she's also Jane's cousin,
2715080	2723560	because, you know, everything's connected. And I guess, you know, I think I don't think you'd know
2723560	2729640	the other people, but a lot of them turned out to be showrunners in the 80s and 90s. Yeah.
2731080	2735480	And Lawrence like kind of came and saw you and scooped you up or what happened? Yeah. He saw me.
2735560	2743880	I was doing characters and he came with Lily Tomlin. He was producing her special. They hired
2743880	2749960	me for that. And then later, Lauren came back and saw me doing new characters and new material and
2749960	2755080	hired me for SNL. What characters were you doing? And let's see one of them.
2756760	2761800	Was there anything that we might like recognize or was it all news? I was doing the Valley Girl
2761880	2769400	and Sherry the Stewardess. The Swedish Kika lady who did one appearance on SNL.
2771240	2775720	An angry Jewish poet is named Sarah Lynn, who had one appearance on SNL.
2777880	2784840	Alice, who, you know, her mundane existence, she thought was really weird. One appearance on SNL.
2785800	2789320	And then Emily Conehead. Yes. 37.
2793240	2800200	I got a million of them. That's amazing. How was Lily Tomlin? She was great. This was in the 70s
2800200	2805320	and, you know, tapings can go on forever. We went till three in the morning and she was out there
2805320	2810360	doing stand up to keep the audience going. I really admired that so much. Well, now I'm
2810360	2814600	confused about that. You're talking about SNL? No, this was a Lily Tomlin special. Oh, you did.
2814600	2819080	Okay. Lauren came and scouted you from the Groundlings to do the Lily Tomlin special.
2819080	2826120	They actually were looking for men, but they hired me. That is a double achievement, as all you ladies
2826120	2836520	know. Who are the original Groundlings that we might know? Archie Han. Yeah, I know the name,
2837080	2842040	oh gosh. I don't think you'd know any of them, except for the people I mentioned. My very first
2842040	2845880	play when I was four years old, I was at the Groundlings Theatre. You're kidding. Yeah. And
2845880	2850440	Paul Rubens was doing a show and one of his characters was Pee Wee. Oh my god. Yeah. And
2850440	2856040	we weren't allowed to see it because apparently it was not for kids. It wasn't. I met Paul Rubens
2856040	2863240	at CalArts. I was there for three months and he was an architecture student. His hair was this long,
2863320	2871960	ringless. And we did an improv show there. And then I left to join this improv group that became
2871960	2876680	the Groundlings. And then when I got SNL, Paul asked me if he should go to the Groundlings. And I said,
2877480	2884600	yes. Do you still actively do improv? Every once in a while, the alumni shows at the Groundlings.
2885320	2891400	But I also do improv classes taught by this guy, Bill Steinkillner, who is a show runner for
2891400	2896120	Cheers and lots of other sitcoms. You're taking them as a student? Yes. That's just for fun. It's
2896120	2901400	all Groundlings alumni. You know, it's like, oh. That is like the most fun. Actually, the most fun
2901400	2905320	I can recall is when we were doing like workshops, comedy sports, because it was like you just do
2905320	2909880	these crazy scenes. If you had a cool teacher, you would just do these like, you're like in the
2909880	2914440	middle of, you're in the back room of a bar at three in the afternoon and you're drinking beer
2914440	2919160	and like a scene might go for 90 minutes and just becomes, and it's like, and it's the best audience
2919160	2923640	in the world, which a bunch of other like drunk people that are like, like, this is amazing that
2923640	2929080	we do this. And you were all very, very old. And so it's like, well, George couldn't make it. He had
2929080	2936120	knee replacement. But yeah. Yeah. That feeling, especially like when there's nothing to lose
2936120	2942200	anymore, when it's not like, oh, I hope I get into the triple A. Yeah. But the games that
2942280	2949080	Bill has created are so sophisticated and wonderful and so fun. And, you know, nothing
2949080	2955560	like the, the violin games. He's just like grown it to a, I hate using that word exponential.
2956360	2960760	But do you find yourself going through when you do improv and you enter a scene to you
2961480	2966920	blackout, you like, like, cause Rob and I have talked about this, like, as bad as we are at
2966920	2972600	improv. Like we're not like, we're not like guys that you would compare to like the good long form
2972600	2977000	people that we see who are like such great listeners and maybe like, like disciplined and
2977000	2981640	all this stuff. But I don't know. It's like, there is this, is there this thing like where you kind of
2981640	2986360	blackout? Yeah, absolutely. I'm a shitty improviser. I was never good. I always did character
2986360	2990040	monologues at the ground links. I was never a good improviser. Do you think it's because you're a bad
2990040	2995960	listener or bad multitasker? I'm slow, very slow. You need to process and like everybody else is like,
2995960	3000360	all over. I'm a slow processor. I watch the ASCAT things like sometimes they have me and I'm like
3000360	3004920	watching these guys and I'm like, how on earth did they split the difference between this much
3004920	3009400	crowd pleasing and this much actual discipline? I don't even know. Cause also they're like denying
3009400	3013240	and all this shit like that, that I learned as rules. It's like, oh, the only way through a scene
3013240	3018440	is if you apply all these fucking rules and then maybe something good will come out of it. But the
3018520	3024600	like UCB is like, they teach just like this, like crazy, like, no, this is how you do a sketch
3024600	3028600	in three minutes, which I guess is how they kind of rose. That's nice for them.
3032040	3036760	I mean, they do really hard shows. They have a show called the crazy uncle Joe show,
3036760	3040920	and it's all, you know, suggestions from the audience. And what they do is they do like
3040920	3045560	short little scenes and they go back and forth in time. So they have to remember what they
3045560	3052840	established and the characters they established in each scene. That's hard. That is really hard.
3053640	3058040	I find watching improv, I do a lot of improv, it's mostly short stuff, like, you know,
3058040	3062760	like gamey stuff. Watching other people do improv scares the shit out of me.
3062760	3063080	Me too.
3063080	3066600	Doing improv doesn't scare me at all. But what, like being in the audience, I'm
3067160	3068200	sweating. I'm nervous.
3068200	3070040	Yeah. My stomach hurts. Absolutely.
3070040	3070760	Watching other people.
3070760	3073560	You project yourself up on stage. You're like, oh, I wouldn't have thought of that.
3073640	3077800	I wouldn't have done that. I'd be fucked up there. I wouldn't be able to make it.
3077800	3081960	But when you're up on stage, you go into that blackout, you roll your eyes back and just bite
3081960	3082520	like a shark.
3084520	3087640	My big limitation is I was always like a bad listener.
3087640	3089640	You bite like a shark, you guys.
3089640	3091560	Yeah, I don't know if you should be biting.
3091560	3093160	This is real improv talk, you guys.
3094760	3098520	Like, yeah, I would just like wait off stage and I'd see a scene and then I'd go like, okay,
3098520	3101320	I think I'll be the plumber. They're clearly, they need a plumber here.
3102280	3105960	And then I got this great idea and I come in and I just sort of like, I don't fucking like,
3105960	3109800	I want to watch other people doing it better. Like where they're like, even though they're
3109800	3114680	talking, they're still listening and they're, and they're like able to, but I think Shrob and I are
3114680	3119080	in the same category. It's like you come in as a plumber. You already decided that you're a plumber
3119080	3122600	and that the reason you're a plumber is because Voltron's parked outside. And if somebody's like,
3122600	3126360	hold on, I need Ben Franklin. You're like, Ben Franklin doesn't exist. There's a Voltron outside.
3126360	3130280	You just like, you're like, fuck everybody. Like I have an idea. If you just give it a chance,
3130280	3136200	you'd learn. And that's maybe, I don't know if that's like, like, like a writer's mind or
3136200	3141800	versus, or it's just bad improv. Well, it's also, it's like in relationships where
3142680	3147400	you want that person to feel heard and understood, but you're really just waiting for them to stop
3147400	3151960	talking. So you can go ahead and say the thing you already made up your mind. That's a problem
3151960	3158280	in improv. That is a problem. And in real life, yes. I find the secret is to come out on stage and
3158280	3163720	as soon as possible, make a butt or a titty or a dick joke. Why are you leaving out farts?
3165240	3169720	You're blowing my mind, Lorraine. That's that ground link shit.
3171640	3176520	Would you mind if we brought up my friend Steve Levy to the stage? And Dan,
3177960	3182040	speaking of, speaking of Levy, I'm not allowed to talk when my voice gets tired,
3182040	3185160	it's starting to get tired. So I will take my Levy as you welcome a new Levy. All right,
3185160	3198200	let's welcome Jeff for coming by. And let's all welcome Jeff's replacement. No pressures,
3198200	3206440	Steve Levy. Oh, man. The new Jeff. That is a lot of pressure. Oh, boy. Watch this detonate.
3214920	3220280	What's going on? And tell me whenever I'm being forward. Totally. You don't want to talk or
3220280	3224600	whatever, but just your love life. What's going on? Are you dating or whatever? You know,
3225560	3230440	some people want to know. And like, like, but we don't have to know. No, no, I look, I'm not,
3230440	3239720	I'm not dating. Just talk slowly. I'm not dating anybody. Why did you make them do that? I thought
3239720	3248040	it was gonna be sex, sexy, sexy. It's good listening to, you know, you're not dating anybody.
3248040	3253080	It's hard out there in the streets. Look, I'm on those. I'm on those bumbles. And I'm even on
3253080	3259720	those Ryas. But you got on those Ryas. Steve got into Raya. Sorry for yelling. Steve got into Raya.
3261400	3266360	It's for famous people. But I'm not Steve. Yeah.
3270600	3277720	Meanwhile, I'm sitting over here. I'm on Bumble. What? I got to get you on Raya. Do you? That's
3277720	3285720	what I've been saying. What the fuck are you guys talking about? I'll try to explain it to Lorraine
3285720	3290680	because I think that way maybe. How do you know? Well, I don't entirely know. So maybe we can
3290680	3296840	access it if I try to explain it to Lorraine. It's one of the dating apps, but it's like,
3296840	3304200	it's selective for famous people. You start with the baseline of famous people, but then also it
3304680	3310440	could be construed as rich people. It's basically like elite people. But it also turns out to be
3310440	3315400	based on some algorithm that it has to do with Instagram followers and that's it. No, no. But
3315400	3321960	you also need references and to submit an application. It's like an episode of Black Mirror.
3323720	3329640	It's almost worse than that. Yeah. Because it's sort of like, I'm sure nobody on it is complaining,
3329640	3335400	but I'm sure none of them want anyone else to know it exists because it makes it an easy target.
3335400	3341880	It's such an obscenely elitist thing that would only draw derision from anyone that
3341880	3345480	isn't able to get into it. You'd be like, Oh my God. Well, don't people have trouble admitting
3345480	3351320	they're on a dating site to begin with? Yeah. Do they now? Yeah. I mean, this app covers it up
3351320	3357080	and it just says connecting. It doesn't even go into like, Oh, this is a dating app. It's
3357080	3363800	for professionals seeking other professionals. Is that a true thing though? Being on an app,
3363800	3370040	that's not a, don't most people, you have, you have young daughters. Like don't they,
3370040	3375640	isn't it part of like youthful society to just like everybody's on two or three of these things?
3375640	3382760	No, they're on a lot of them. A lot of different ones. I think my kid's daughters. Oh, no. No,
3382760	3388920	people in general, they always seem to find people without that. Oh, all right. Well,
3388920	3394040	maybe for the Newman's, but I'm blinders. That's their name. Oh, okay. Yep.
3395720	3398120	Anyway, that was a conversation stopper.
3400360	3406280	Um, well, I just, I gotta get, but you gotta get on there because it's, why can't I get on?
3406280	3411720	I couldn't get any bumble matches, but on Raya, so many matches. Why can't I get on Raya? Did you
3412040	3419960	famous? I will. Wait, you have to try. Let me, let me pull some strings, you know. Yeah. No,
3419960	3425880	pull some strings. I'll get you on that right. He got me first class to Boston. I did. Yes.
3425880	3433400	That has to cost way more money than joining an app. Yeah. So go ahead, Dan. Yes. Didn't you,
3433400	3438920	didn't you say something about Raya being so exclusive that if they just, that they have to
3438920	3442920	match you with people that are like, yeah, it's international. It's not just so you're really
3442920	3447720	just whatever city you're in. Yeah. I'm matching with people in like Sweden, the UK, another famous
3447720	3454440	person. Oh, it's the lead singer of the Icelandic rock band. Australian. Yeah. Here's hoping we
3454440	3460840	hook up one day. Yeah. Okay. I think it's kind of exciting talking to people from other places.
3460840	3466680	Yeah. Cause they're famous. Yeah. That's why. Cause they're famous. It's a guarantee. Look,
3466680	3473320	it's kind of gross. I mean, Oh, it's exceedingly gross. I should have explained before I said,
3473320	3477720	look, it's kind of gross. What I was going to say before saying anyway, Steve's dick there. So when
3479080	3485640	like, it's kind of gross. My deck's on there. It's web. There's, um, so, so like all the other dating
3485640	3491400	apps, you get a profile and there's a play button and you hit the play button and it there's a,
3491400	3500600	a really nice, like, uh, like, uh, like a company logo. Like, uh, like, are you allowed to be
3500600	3506360	telling us this? I don't know. Bruce Lee died. It's like a picture. It's like a picture presentation
3506360	3512760	with whatever song you choose, which gives you a lot of, it's so terrible. It is, it is terrible.
3512760	3516600	I showed Spencer. Good business is where you find it. It's a sizzle reel.
3516600	3525000	Oil. It's like you lifting a weight. A sizzle reel for dating. Yeah. That is the
3525000	3531720	end of civilization. Remember the, when, when, when video dating first happened before it was,
3533240	3539880	Jeff might just be leaving because yeah. Oh, there's no bacteria. Have you been back there?
3539880	3547880	We love you, Jeff. Remember when video, before computer dating, it was video dating because
3547880	3554200	video, and then I was a kid, but you, the idea was you, the modern, and everyone was like,
3554200	3560920	is this going to ruin love? It's so systematized because you'd go to a place and then check out
3560920	3567720	videos and take them into a private room and watch candidates. And then there'd just be like them
3567720	3572840	against a backdrop, the same backdrop. Usually I go, my name's Maggie, and I like walks on the beach
3572840	3579480	and Jesus Christ. Somebody posted those old videos on, I think, Facebook. They are hilarious.
3580200	3585720	They really are. It's like bad family photos. It's that kind of thing. There's a big, I was,
3585720	3593160	I was listening to this podcast, The Illusionist. It's like a language. Helen Zoltzman. Yeah. Yeah.
3593160	3600760	Great podcast. She had a dating app kind of, I don't know, specialist expert, something. Somebody
3600760	3606040	was talking about profiles that get swiped or whatever the fuck. It's just an interesting
3606040	3611720	question, whether you're supposed to lie to people, trick people, what the truth is. What is
3611720	3619880	charisma? It's so primal and so ridiculous still. We got this whole new generation of kids. They're
3619880	3624920	using these apps, but you can clearly, from what I'm hearing from their conversation, it's like,
3624920	3630440	oh, it's just a bunch of morons doing the same things that we always did. Like, oh, it's guys
3630440	3635240	thinking that if you just treat a girl mean, it'll like, she'll be like, well, who's this
3635240	3641240	bruiser? And sometimes they're right accidentally in the fucking match made in hell and now you're
3641240	3647560	going to have a serial killer. Did anybody, God, anybody watch Nikki Glaser's show? She had this
3647560	3657160	bit where she would create... God, let me just see if I can say this succinctly. It would be like
3657160	3663800	an online dating thing, but we would see the chat and the chat from her end would be so egregious
3663800	3669960	and horrible. And the guess was, how long would the guy stay on? And it was hilarious. Isn't that
3669960	3681800	a good story? Oh, God. It is crazy, the disproportionate reality of your average guy
3681800	3691720	and how clueless the average guy is versus how socialized for, I'll make anything work and also,
3691720	3698680	I have a million ways out of this. The women who are socialized to tolerate this shit. How early
3698680	3705080	does that happen? That like by 17, you can see it, like the guys are just like hammerhead sharks.
3705080	3709160	I don't know if that's how hammerhead sharks work. I just picture hammerhead sharks as like
3709160	3715800	beating against a boat until it sinks. Why would you shape a shark like that? I mean...
3715800	3716760	Drowning and pussy.
3717640	3724840	Shape your sharks right, bro. Talking to you, God. Chesting up with my anti-nerd neck.
3725800	3729800	Shape your sharks right. What are you, a nerd, God?
3732040	3735000	That was bad when I said drowning and pussy, right? I couldn't resist.
3736200	3739960	That was so funny. Such a great visual. Yeah. Just like the cannonball guy.
3742040	3748040	But yeah, I don't know. I guess I just brought that up. I had nothing. That doesn't land anywhere.
3748840	3752200	But you just like... So anyway, this gross thing that I do...
3754040	3758360	Oh, you... Yeah, I forgot to finish that. Did I interrupt you a million years ago?
3758360	3763080	Who cares? It's probably gonna suck anyway. But look, the profile, it links you to their
3763080	3768120	Instagram. You can click on it. You can see if they're a cool person or not. But like the thing
3768120	3773640	I always clock is how many Instagram followers they have because they make it a requirement sort
3773640	3779480	of for the app. And I'm like, oh, this person seems extra famous. Maybe I weigh that in my
3779480	3783640	consideration of whether I swipe a letter. That is attractive. What do you have to put in?
3785720	3790920	Thanks, Vince. Yeah. Well, this app is for you, but I'm gonna get you right on there.
3792120	3799640	When you set up your profile, what do you have to say? Oh, I mean, you select however many pictures
3799640	3806600	you want, then you go through like essentially Spotify and pick whatever song you want.
3806600	3811000	What song did you pick? I picked Good Times, Bad Times by Led Zeppelin.
3811960	3816600	Hey. Yeah. So you're like, what are you gonna get with me? A Schmargas board.
3817320	3820520	Yeah. I mean, I didn't really... I didn't think about it.
3820520	3822760	I'm not promising shit. You're gonna get a human being.
3822760	3827480	Great. Ups and towns, baby. I'm a fucking idiot. I didn't think about it like that. I just like,
3827480	3832840	you know, I want them to know I like classic rock. I'm gonna steer away from Dave Matthews.
3833560	3838360	Led Zeppelin. Right? Why steer away from Dave Matthews now?
3838360	3841720	Is that your dirty secret? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, it's not a secret.
3842920	3849000	It's dirty, but it's not a secret. I love them, but I don't want people judging me.
3849000	3852040	You're aware of the stigma. Of course there's a fucking stigma.
3852040	3855480	Spencer. Oh, go ahead. Go. At least it's not Nickelback.
3856120	3860200	Yeah. Why don't I know why people bag on that band? I don't know their sound.
3860200	3861720	I don't know if I've ever heard... I'm sure I've heard Nickelback.
3861720	3866440	But they're on lunch. They're a punchline. Yeah, I know. I always hear bands like that.
3866440	3870040	I'll hear the band name because I'll see a stand-up comic or something. They'll go like,
3870040	3874040	at least I'm not Hoosenfusen. And then I'll be like, boy, I've got to stay away from this
3874040	3878040	Hoosenfusen. I'll find out. Six months later, I'm like, I love those guys. There's a toe-tapping
3878040	3881000	jukebox song, Hoosenfusen. They're the guys that did Strahd Digger.
3881000	3885720	Yeah. Squarepusher. Strahd Digger.
3886840	3890920	Nickelback is just a funny sounding name. Yeah. It's like Pennywise.
3890920	3894520	That could be. It's got a bunch of Ks in it. What's that?
3895320	3898840	It is like Pennywise. Are you a Pennywise fan since you don't like Pennywise?
3898840	3901880	And how? Yeah. Did you like the new Pennywise?
3901880	3904520	I did. Did you like the old Pennywise?
3904520	3907560	I did. Oh, God. Yeah. Tim Curry. Yeah.
3907560	3910760	The best. Yeah, Dan. Tim Curry. Did you like that, Dan?
3911880	3915560	I thought it was a little long. The mini series? Yeah.
3915560	3919400	But I've always, I always get, we always get through the whole thing whenever we watch it.
3919400	3923080	That and Langoliers. Did you like Langoliers?
3924760	3930520	Langoliers. Yeah. I think it's safe to say now, because I didn't want, I didn't want to like,
3930520	3936520	you know, like, I don't know. I get the, so Stephen King's son, which I'm sure he does not
3936600	3942200	want to be known as, because he's an author. Joe Hill. Joe Hill. Great writer.
3942200	3948200	He came to the Boston show and it's like, you've met him? Have you seen a photo of him?
3948200	3952840	Yeah. What the fuck? Dude, how dense is that Stephen King gene?
3955480	3961560	He looked, it was like, how much other people do you have to add to Stephen King's come?
3962280	3966040	I like before, and the answer, because he brought his kids and his kids were like,
3966040	3971560	I was like, okay, now we're, now we're cooling down a little here. And Stephen King, by the way,
3971560	3976520	now I want to make it clear, not an ugly man. I think he's got a very curious handsomeness and
3976520	3982680	his son is like all the more, all the more rugged. And that's what I'd like to be described as a
3982680	3988760	curious handsomeness. But so specific. It's just like, oh, Stephen King. Oh my God, Stephen King.
3988760	3993080	Holy shit. Stephen fucking King. We got to call you something different.
3995480	3997640	Anyways. Yeah. I don't know. I just found that remarkable.
3998360	4002600	We never got to hear about the, uh, RISD. What is it called?
4002600	4005720	Raya. We never got to hear about it. We keep interrupting.
4005720	4010520	Well, yeah, it sounds like it's going perfectly or horribly and there's no difference.
4010520	4013480	What's your video? What's the video you had to make?
4014120	4017880	I just put a bunch of pictures. So have you met up with anybody?
4017880	4021880	I have not, but I've spoken with a bunch of people. A lot of them live all over the world.
4021880	4025640	It's hard to meet up. That's fantastic. I love that.
4025640	4030920	But I made some new long distance friends, which is fine, right? That's nice.
4036840	4043400	I guess famous people should be more poised and globalist and, uh, and friend friendly.
4044360	4048440	Famous people should be more friendly. Yeah. Because they're, they're, they're,
4048440	4052440	they're, they're famous in their fortune. Right. Well, I'm not going to be famous by
4052440	4060520	being grouchy towards some Icelandic guitarist. It's a good practice for bigger levels of fame.
4060520	4069800	What would be your song, Dan? Uh, take me home by Phil Collins.
4069800	4075000	Take me home? Why is that going? Uh, well, the important part of the lyrics
4075000	4080280	that I would want a perspective made to hear is I can turn off my feelings like I'm turning off a
4080280	4092520	light. I feel like it's important to know. Like I, like it resolves them of a certain
4092520	4099480	amount of responsibility and it warns them. Okay. Not as funny as I thought.
4099480	4106600	No. Because you detected more, not as untrue as I would like to believe. It is good advice.
4107480	4112760	That's the old reversal of, okay. I thought it would, I thought it would be one of those things
4112760	4120680	where Spencer, what would your theme song be? Oh, um, um, oh, oh, um, Dave Matthews.
4122920	4127640	I think that Steve made a grave error by not going with it's too on the nose.
4127720	4133320	Right. I just, you know, but I think yours would be that teen Titan song. How does that one go?
4133320	4139960	Oh, uh, there's this song. It's not funny to explain. There's a song called night begins to
4139960	4147320	shine. It's, uh, it's fun to listen to on repeat, like for two hours straight. It's really good.
4147320	4152280	And he's done it. I've been there. Oh, he's Steve's been there. But Spencer's
4153240	4158360	version of it's great. You want, can you give us a little bit of it? Um, I don't know. Are we
4158360	4166680	going to get sued? No. What are you? No, no, go ahead. Let's get sued. That's a
4166680	4170440	just a piece of the hook, dude. We've done everything else on this podcast. Let's get sued.
4170440	4179400	No, no, no. We're going to court. All right. Hold on. So Phil teen Titans coming at you
4180200	4186440	bigger than regular teens. That's true. Each of them is bigger than you and their teens.
4191160	4192280	I gotta fast forward.
4196760	4197720	This guy loves this song.
4209400	4215960	The night begins to we'd be on the road and it'd be like a, just a silence and Spencer.
4221720	4226680	And this will seem loaded Lorraine and you can lie if you want, but you're 23 year old. Is she
4227320	4238120	single? Um, she doesn't tell me. Steve doesn't need any help. Get me on Raya. I was Jesus Christ.
4238120	4243560	I was trying to set you up with a, with a, with a, with a clone that I'm to ease. I'm to,
4243560	4251320	I'm to go off half cocked. That's what's known about me. I had you this close to SNL legacy.
4251320	4252440	I blew it. I blew it.
4256920	4261080	All right. Well, who was affected by this horrible shooting with trader Joe's
4261880	4265880	is anyone trauma? We were out of town. We were out of town. I wasn't,
4267240	4271480	it happened like very close to where I live. We were on Doug loves movies. Well,
4271480	4276440	this was all happening. Nobody in the audience lost a, or got any loved one hurt or anything.
4276440	4283640	Did they, my partner went to the other trader Joe's at that very moment. Your part, as he said,
4283640	4288840	in case nobody heard, he's your partner went to the other trader Joe's at that moment. So in
4288840	4299800	other words, it was like a fluke. Oh my God. I almost went to the other one.
4307720	4313160	You know, I solicited it and I, I mean, it was good. It was all good. Everyone wins.
4313240	4314520	I just don't want him to feel bad.
4317800	4321400	Well, what else do we have to accomplish? D and D. Should we D and D? Should we play D and D?
4324920	4328440	All right. Lorraine, you have a choice. I don't want to put you on the spot. You can,
4328440	4334920	you can, you can, you can, you can exude or you're going to play D and D. Yeah. I'll be leaving.
4334920	4341560	Okay. I don't know anything about it. And, uh, let's all thank the fabulous and honest Lorraine
4341560	4359560	Newman. Thank you so much for coming. Fantastic. I'll, uh, I'll pass out the thing.
4360440	4366520	Oh God. Friend of the podcast, Lorraine Newman, who would have thought that was so good. It's
4366520	4371720	kind of like living in a crazy dream, Los Angeles. Like you end up, you end up rubbing elbows with
4371720	4379640	the, with the people that you watched on the magic box. So fun. And then after a while,
4380760	4389320	you've done enough. You get tired. You start to go, this box was never magic.
4389320	4398760	I was controlling it the whole time. Okay. Here we go. Then
4399720	4403800	with the game. Do you remember what? Oh, you weren't here the last.
4406920	4407880	I love this tradition.
4408680	4416600	It's good. The fabulous Lorraine Newman, second exit.
4419160	4427240	Lorraine Newman, Garrett Morris. We used to, we used to sit around and do that. We would do
4427240	4433400	that impression. I do that impression. Gary Kroger. Sometimes you go into the later years.
4433400	4440600	Spence, you want to hit us? Julia Louis Dreyfus. Zach, you got that D and D music queued up. Oh,
4440600	4446280	hell yeah. Spence hit us with a recap, bro. Last time would be your music.
4447000	4451800	Yeah, I was going to say that, but that seemed to on the nose. This is his day. Matthew's
4453800	4462040	last time on Harmon time, our heroes were escaping from town after they, uh, tried to kidnap
4462040	4467640	Shrove and Shrove got away. They gave up and left the town, but DJ went back to the town and
4467640	4472360	got kidnapped. So the gang had to rescue them and they did. And then they got in a fight
4472360	4480280	where they found some clues that led them to find Patchen's jab after killing some vampires. They
4480280	4485640	went to go help with a fire. And then when they were helping with the fire, they caused more fire
4485640	4490040	or something. I think they put out the fire and then restarted the fire. That sounds right.
4491000	4497160	And then they made a hasty retreat, but they were followed by a couple of farmers. And as they
4497160	4501880	escaped, the farmers pursued them. And then they started cutting the farmers down to sides. It was
4501880	4506600	pretty much overkill because they were just farmers and they were morally armed. And so then
4506600	4511320	they just kind of, I think like you guys convinced them to just go away and you're like, we're just
4511320	4517080	going to leave. And then you just kind of left. And then you got a raven, uh, telling you to go
4517160	4522200	on a new mission, which you were going to do. And then you did, we're going towards the new mission
4522200	4527960	place. And then you saw a cult and it sounded like you were going to attack the cult. Now.
4538920	4542680	What are you eating? I either, I forgot to take my Adderall this morning or
4542680	4550120	this shit's going to get cray cray. But you know what? It tastes like attention.
4552280	4556040	That's why I love it. You're not going to go to bed until four tonight.
4556040	4559400	Well, it depends. Did I take some earlier? I can't remember.
4560360	4563640	Oh boy. I'll learn some new software. Spence, last thing that happened,
4564520	4574520	was it Chad attacking the people? Yeah, but he's, um, no one's playing him right now, right?
4574520	4580680	Or do you want to play Chad instead of, um, instead of, uh, the shambling mouth, Gary? No.
4580680	4584520	Okay. Well, let's have somebody up. What about our friend, Michael Waldron? He's in the audience.
4584520	4588760	Oh yeah. Waldron's here. Okay. He's white. He just gave a look.
4588760	4598360	Well, we got, okay. We got a lot of volunteers. All right. Uh, wait, wait. How do we do this
4598360	4603480	fairly? Don't, don't, don't play on my sense of fairness. What? Wait a minute.
4607000	4613960	I'm hearing podcast dynamite. How blind are you? Legally blind still counts.
4614920	4618920	I got you. You look a little odd, like, like, like, is that part of the albinism?
4618920	4623240	Is that you're, you're living with albinism? All right. Get up here.
4625480	4630840	And, and, and someone help him. I think the stairs are on the other side. Oh, there are stairs.
4630840	4639240	Jesus. What a hero. He just like, they go really, uh, I have some, I have some albino questions.
4640120	4645640	Starting with, is the word albino? Cause we have a chat. Is that, how's this offensive, you know?
4645640	4649000	There are two different things, but I don't get offended by it. There's, there's too many groups
4649000	4652760	getting pissed about us playing villains and we're all, we're actually all villains. Right.
4653640	4658520	I have a friend, Victor Varnado. He was a channel one on one guy and he's like, yeah, he's like,
4658520	4665000	cast as villains. Like, like, yeah, yeah. Like, like angels that are fallen angels. Or pedophiles
4665800	4672760	and suits. Uh, so, so, so is the word. So do you think, is that part of, is, is the,
4672760	4678520	is the suit you're wearing a beautiful, uh, pinstripe suit? Like, are you, are you a hit man?
4680360	4683800	I would be the shittiest hit man ever. Unless it was nighttime. Do you,
4685080	4689400	are you compensating for exotic good looks? Like, cause you don't want, because you're like,
4689400	4693480	look, I'm going to fucking suit, like, like respect me as a human being. Don't like,
4693560	4697000	I don't know. I just always liked them. And, uh, also they covers their, you know,
4697000	4700280	they breathe more than, than shirts. So, you know, the sun doesn't touch as much of my skin.
4700920	4702520	Like a VM part. What's your name, by the way?
4702520	4703000	Kalen.
4703000	4705960	Kalen. Uh, what's your last name?
4706920	4707720	Uh, Chase.
4707720	4708680	Well, I, wait.
4708680	4711240	Whoa. What? Say it again. Say it together.
4711240	4712040	You just doxed him.
4712680	4714600	What? Kalen.
4714600	4715720	Well, he doxed himself.
4715720	4716840	Oh, I don't know what happened.
4716840	4718200	Wow.
4718200	4721480	What? Maybe he doesn't want it as first to last name. I don't know.
4721800	4723560	Don't worry about it. It's on IMDB.
4725560	4726520	All right. All right. All right.
4730040	4730520	What?
4730520	4734600	Sorry. I didn't, I worry about people. I try to protect them.
4734600	4737000	I don't know what you can't do, obviously.
4737720	4744040	I'm just saying, Kate, Kate and Chase sounds like a badass. That's it.
4744040	4744440	Thanks.
4744440	4745720	It does. Kalen Chase.
4745720	4746200	Oh wow.
4748200	4750360	Mr. Chase, will you please?
4750360	4751000	Do you want a drink?
4751800	4752840	I would love one.
4752840	4755160	All right. Well, let's get you a glass. Jesus Christ.
4756520	4757400	Steve's on it.
4759080	4762120	I have followed Chad the Fire Liker a little bit.
4762120	4762680	Oh, okay.
4762680	4763080	Hell yeah.
4763080	4767000	You know, I can't see what he has. I'll just ask Spencer, you know, what I can throw at stuff.
4767000	4770360	Oh yeah. I mean, Chad's out of spells right now, basically, too.
4770360	4771480	So it's not...
4771480	4773480	I'll just use my poison cunning.
4773480	4773720	Yeah.
4774600	4777400	Wait, but can I get, as long as I have you, so I have this chance.
4777400	4779000	Because, like, so I just want to know.
4781000	4787000	Like, the language of it all.
4789240	4796680	Is it rude to call someone albino? Like, in what context? And can you tutor me?
4797880	4803000	So the albinos, like, from that movie with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn,
4803000	4808600	where the guy with the pink eyes, like, albinos have 20-20 vision, pink eyes,
4808600	4809880	and they're a little more pale.
4810520	4813080	And albinistic people usually have ocular...
4813080	4816520	So I have a pigment in the front of my eyes, but I have vision problems.
4816520	4819560	My eyes shake and stuff like that, but I look more normal.
4819560	4822920	So it's much more funny when I bump into things and things like that.
4822920	4825560	They're like, oh, I thought you were just a Scandinavian who's clumsy.
4825560	4831480	So that actually is... That gets complicated.
4831480	4833880	There's a minefield there, because you can be...
4834600	4839560	Because it's not even like, oh, yeah, so an albino is...
4840280	4846200	But it seems like, with language, the key is let's not call people things.
4846200	4851560	So calling someone unautistic is like, okay, this is a bad idea.
4852680	4856360	And so calling someone unalbino, I would assume, is bad.
4856360	4861080	But I'm hearing that you can't say, oh, that person with albinism,
4861080	4862760	because that would be you instead.
4862760	4865240	And you'd be like, don't slump me in with that fucking pink eye.
4867000	4869320	Generally, if somebody's really interested, if they ask me,
4869320	4871000	I'd say, excuse me, I'm sorry to ask.
4871000	4871720	Are you albino?
4871720	4873320	I'd be like, technically, yes.
4873320	4875880	And if you'd like to know the reason and you have a minute, I'll tell you.
4875880	4878200	But it's like, most people are just like, oh, yeah, yeah,
4878200	4879240	he has no pigment and that's fine.
4879240	4881000	I'm like, yeah, I don't mind.
4881000	4882120	I'll lump myself in with them.
4882120	4884760	It's just, you know, I don't have the pink eyes and I can't drive.
4884760	4887320	It's like if you asked Worf if he was a Romulan.
4889080	4892040	I think he'd take more offense than I do, but I'm pretty easy going, I suppose.
4893560	4900760	How often do strangers in a public place, do they inquire about that?
4900760	4907400	Mostly, it's way less around here, because there's so many weirdos and just people, you know.
4907400	4912040	Because if you can handle David Duchovny sitting near you without acknowledging it,
4912040	4915720	you're like, we're trained to respect people by treating them like ghosts.
4915720	4919560	You can go most places, but yeah, anywhere in the Midwest, you know.
4919560	4921160	It's the moms, the tourists.
4921160	4923240	They'll go like, excuse me, could you tell me?
4923240	4923960	Yeah, yeah.
4923960	4926040	And then the farther east you get there, you're just like, hey.
4927480	4928520	Hey, settle the bet.
4929640	4930360	You an angel?
4933560	4934120	Yes.
4934120	4935160	Give me three wishes.
4937000	4938280	Is that how angels work?
4938280	4939400	You got to rub the lamp.
4940680	4942200	How come your eyes ain't pink?
4943000	4943960	You got to rub the lamp?
4943960	4944440	You check it?
4944440	4945880	Yeah, you take advantage.
4945880	4946200	All right.
4946200	4946760	Well, thank you.
4946760	4949480	Thank you for answering all those questions and not being like,
4949480	4952040	because I know that's got to be, like, whatever.
4952040	4952360	I don't know.
4952360	4953240	It could be irritating.
4953240	4954200	I don't know.
4954200	4957960	I now go forth into the world a little more educated.
4957960	4959560	Yeah, go with the east coast thing, though.
4959560	4960280	It's more funny.
4960280	4963320	By the way, I could Google it if I really had empathy.
4963320	4970840	But instead, I just wait and just abuse strangers in front of my microphone.
4970840	4971320	But thank you.
4971320	4972120	Thank you for joining us.
4972120	4972520	All right.
4972520	4975720	So, Kaitlyn Chase, what a...
4975720	4977720	Cool first and last name.
4977720	4978840	Glad we found it out.
4978840	4979400	That's all right.
4980520	4982600	Now that I know he's an actor, that's fine.
4982600	4986840	Yeah, so last we left off, Chad was attacking these cultists.
4986840	4991640	Well, he certainly was announcing he was attacking and seemingly charging towards...
4991640	4996360	I have no spell, so I'd like to stop in my tracks swiftly and look back at my crew.
4996360	4997240	Oh, shit.
4997240	4997960	You do that.
4998840	5003160	They're looking at you as if maybe for guidance or confusion.
5004760	5005800	What a false alarm.
5006280	5009560	I'd like to defer to Carlos or someone who knows more and has spells.
5010760	5011960	That's a good instinct.
5013400	5014520	They were doing aerobics?
5014520	5015240	What were they doing?
5015240	5017640	They were doing aerobics, seemingly.
5017640	5019160	They were very far away.
5019160	5021480	I mean, I love aerobics.
5021480	5022200	We should join them.
5023400	5027880	I think that's actually as ridiculous as your pitches usually are,
5028520	5029800	compared to attacking them.
5031000	5032120	I'm willing to...
5032120	5033720	Yeah, let's just join in.
5034280	5038280	He did aerobics with those aerobics cultists many episodes ago.
5038280	5039160	He got all about it.
5039160	5041560	Dude, I'm so good at jumping tracks, you got no idea.
5042360	5045080	Do we need Matt to lay down or can we just...
5045640	5046600	I mean, I'm asking.
5047560	5051080	Do we need Matt to lay down?
5051080	5052200	To lay down?
5052200	5053480	Is it dirt floor?
5053480	5054680	Are they doing yoga?
5054680	5062600	You're on an expansive plains and it's like a flat part in an otherwise rolling landscape
5062600	5063880	of hills and abs.
5063880	5065800	Do we need Matt?
5067240	5070760	I unroll my bedroll and use it as a yoga mat.
5070760	5071160	Okay.
5071160	5074200	And I stand on it and I start doing whatever moves these guys are doing.
5074200	5077720	All right, well, you're very far away, so you're gonna have to approach them.
5077720	5080840	I pick him up and I carry him over there.
5080840	5081640	Hell yeah, let's go.
5082280	5085560	And I say, you have to let me use your mat now.
5085560	5086520	Okay, we can share it.
5086520	5087400	Yeah, we'll share it.
5087400	5088440	Because I'm carrying you.
5088440	5090280	It's great, just don't sweat too much, okay?
5090280	5090680	All right.
5090680	5092280	Made out of plant.
5092280	5093400	You're a big monster.
5093400	5098920	And so, as you approach, the cult kind of looks at you and they stop doing their things
5098920	5100760	and they just all kind of turn to look like...
5100760	5101640	No, no, no, don't know.
5101640	5103080	Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5103080	5104280	We love what you're doing here.
5104280	5105000	He's a good guy.
5105000	5106040	We want to join.
5106040	5106920	He's a good man.
5106920	5107720	What are these moves?
5107720	5108520	Teach us something.
5108520	5110040	Don't be afraid.
5110040	5110600	Don't be afraid.
5110600	5111240	He's a good guy.
5111240	5112200	Are you okay?
5112200	5114520	Are you being harangued by that monster?
5114520	5115640	No, no, he's my friend.
5115640	5116200	I'm fine.
5116200	5117000	His name's Gary.
5117000	5117960	He's a good dude.
5117960	5119800	This guy just wants to do some yoga with you guys.
5119800	5121000	Let's all chill out.
5121000	5122040	He's not a monster.
5122040	5122840	He's a good person.
5122840	5123640	What's yoga?
5126360	5126920	Good question.
5128040	5129400	What are you guys doing?
5129400	5131720	Oh, we're just templifying our bodies.
5134840	5135960	We know all about that.
5135960	5137080	Can we join?
5137080	5138040	Oh, yeah.
5138040	5140680	Templify your bodies and purify your mind.
5141320	5144120	They hand you a white robe with gold trim.
5144920	5147160	Whoa, this is a pretty sweet little robe.
5147160	5148200	That's what they're wearing.
5149320	5150760	It's a little small on me.
5150760	5151640	It's very heavy.
5151640	5152840	It feels like it's weighted.
5155000	5157800	Not like very, very heavy, but like heavier than clothes.
5157800	5160760	Sorry, why are you doing something in a pocket or something?
5160760	5162040	This sounds important.
5162040	5163000	It's like weighted.
5164520	5166440	Is it the gold that makes it heavy?
5166440	5167720	No, it's the clothes.
5168280	5169480	So this is like extra.
5169480	5172920	It's like when you're hiking and you decide to put on a weighted vest
5172920	5175400	and you're just getting like a little extra, you know,
5176200	5177320	holding them in your hand.
5177320	5179160	It reminds you of that exactly.
5179160	5179640	Oh, man.
5180600	5186200	I tie the sleeves around my waist like I'm a badass grunge guy.
5188920	5191800	It's badass like a grunge guy.
5191800	5193000	I put the robe on.
5193000	5194120	How does it feel?
5194120	5195960	Is it like it's heavy?
5195960	5197560	No, but like is it soft?
5197560	5198760	Like what am I working with here?
5198760	5199560	It's nice.
5199560	5205400	It's not like high grade cloth, but in terms of like robes, it's nice.
5205400	5208040	Not like a fine robe, but like hotel bathrobe.
5208760	5210200	Yeah, like a hotel bed.
5210200	5211240	No, not quite.
5211240	5212440	But let's say yes.
5213400	5215640	But no, that doesn't have pockets.
5215640	5218760	When does this become blasphemy for the church is what I want to know.
5218760	5221800	Kaitlyn is legally blind and he can see the social cues.
5224920	5229000	I was like exercising near Chad and I'm like, hey, Chad,
5229000	5231640	because honestly, I'm part of the problem, too, because I was leaning in.
5231640	5233240	I'm just saying, why are we here?
5233240	5234760	I can't remember putting on these robes.
5234760	5236920	I thought maybe information would be ideal,
5237000	5238760	but now we're trying to dress like him.
5238760	5241160	That seems like eventually this is going to go too far.
5241160	5242280	Do you remember what?
5242840	5245080	But why we came here?
5245080	5247240	Well, we were on our way to do a mission.
5247240	5248680	There was two different ones.
5248680	5251240	There was a patrons jam and then we were supposed to go from the church
5251240	5252120	to the other place.
5252120	5253240	It's going to happen first.
5253240	5256520	And now we're doing now we're wearing heat and robes.
5256520	5257640	This is bad news.
5257640	5257960	Right.
5257960	5258600	He's right.
5263320	5266120	Dude, I mean, yeah, but look,
5266120	5267000	I'm getting jacked.
5267000	5270120	So when we hit that mining town, I'm going to be ready for the fight.
5270120	5271960	I say we I say we fuck off and go then.
5271960	5273640	But that's bad guys.
5273640	5274280	You're fighting.
5274280	5275560	You'd be fighting as bad guys.
5275560	5277800	I think we're well, we don't want to fight the good guys.
5277800	5279160	I think we're supposed to be here.
5279160	5283080	I guess I need larger clarity on what the issue is at the mining town.
5283080	5285400	Like, like, is it like an episode of Knight Rider?
5285400	5286200	We read the note.
5286200	5287560	We reconsult the note.
5287560	5289080	Okay, I look at the note again.
5289080	5290520	Hope this note finds you well.
5290520	5293320	Not in a position to reassign you, but you're being reassigned.
5293320	5295000	Head to the mining town of Pontius.
5295000	5298200	There's a dispute between the miners bureau, that is to say,
5298200	5302440	the guild of miners and the church's district prelate, which is to say,
5302440	5303960	a guy at the church.
5303960	5304840	Call it the hunch.
5304840	5308680	But from what I've been hearing, you're just the man to blow up this log jam
5308680	5310680	and help Pontius get back to mining.
5310680	5311320	Okay.
5311320	5315400	Pontius is the guy that we're supposed to help against the union.
5315400	5316840	Pontius is the town.
5316840	5318200	Pontius is the...
5319800	5322600	I call Pontius Mr. Liberty.
5322600	5323480	We should go there.
5324280	5325320	We should stop working out.
5325320	5328520	Right, and so it's the union that we're upset with.
5328520	5329480	Because we're good guys.
5330120	5330760	Fuck the union.
5333000	5333500	Damn.
5334200	5337000	Darn, wow, this guy's crazy.
5339640	5341000	Well, where's the...
5341000	5342840	Hey, this is great exercise.
5342840	5343640	Where's the mine?
5344600	5347720	One of them holds you, hands you a big kettlebell,
5347720	5349720	and is like, purify those abs.
5349720	5351000	Purify those abs.
5351640	5353160	And now we're gonna do this all day.
5354200	5358440	All right, I purify a couple abs with a kettlebell.
5358440	5360280	You feel the sin leaving your body.
5361560	5362120	It's great.
5363720	5365720	Hey, does anybody know where the mines are?
5366680	5368440	Yeah, no, you were on your way there.
5369160	5371960	They're just down this road you were traveling on already.
5371960	5372440	All right.
5373080	5374440	Thanks for helping us get jacked.
5374440	5376120	We're gonna go head that way.
5376120	5379400	Come see our branch office in Blade Glen sometime.
5379400	5380120	What's it called?
5380760	5383560	The branch office of the Church of the Body Temple.
5383560	5385800	Hey, I like branch offices.
5387000	5387480	Hey-o.
5389960	5390840	All right.
5390840	5392120	You thought I was a monster.
5392120	5393320	I'm actually hilarious.
5395560	5396920	Oh, you, that's right.
5397880	5399000	You are funny.
5399000	5400200	Better leave.
5400200	5401640	Yeah, okay, that's the last one.
5402680	5403880	All right, here we go.
5406600	5407560	I thought these guys were pretty cool.
5407560	5408680	Thanks for the sweet road.
5411080	5414120	All right, well, now you see another colt.
5414120	5415880	You've been walking for one more day.
5415880	5418440	You're almost there, but now you see a different colt,
5418440	5419320	completely different.
5420600	5421960	Different robes and everything.
5423720	5425160	Let's hide our robes real quick,
5425160	5428040	just in case it's rival colts.
5428040	5429960	I mean, the punchline is, you guys fucked up.
5429960	5431960	You thought running into colts is so special.
5433640	5434760	They grow on trees.
5435640	5436840	It's random colts.
5437720	5440200	These ones aren't wearing white robes.
5440200	5441960	They're wearing black robes
5441960	5444680	that have bloody colored runes on them.
5444680	5446120	They sound like cool people.
5448120	5452040	I take my robe off and I put it in my sack
5452040	5454440	and I go, whoa, hey, guys.
5455320	5457240	Can I join whatever you're doing?
5459240	5461800	That robe looks pretty freaking cool.
5463880	5464600	What the fuck?
5467720	5469880	Okay, so you're really far off again
5469880	5471640	like the last time when you're seeing this colt.
5471640	5473720	I pick him up and I carry him over.
5474440	5478680	Yeah, and then I take off my white robe
5478680	5480840	and I'm like, yeah, yeah.
5480840	5482600	It just got done kicking the shit
5482600	5484760	out of these white robe guys.
5484760	5487560	Think I'll wipe my ass a little bit
5487560	5488920	with this white robe
5488920	5490520	because I don't like it that much.
5492120	5494520	Hey, you guys look cool, huh?
5494520	5495080	Yeah.
5495080	5496840	You don't have any white robes around here
5496840	5498840	because we don't like them at all.
5498840	5500920	They seem, these guys seem very busy.
5500920	5502440	There's about six of them.
5502440	5505080	You guys look busy, huh?
5505080	5507080	Yeah, and most of them are chanting
5507080	5510120	and like kind of involved in incantation
5510120	5512360	that doesn't seem to involve you.
5512360	5513720	They do notice your approach
5513720	5515560	and one of them who isn't chanting,
5515560	5516600	he walks you over
5516600	5519080	and kind of points that at somewhere to stand
5519080	5520600	because you seem cool.
5521320	5522120	Yeah, I know.
5522120	5524520	You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome.
5524520	5526680	And then he hands you like a big black candle.
5527400	5529000	Well, do we get robes?
5529000	5529640	No, no.
5531560	5533480	Okay, so do you want to take,
5533480	5534600	should we take our spots there?
5535320	5536680	Yeah, I got a candle.
5536680	5537960	Okay, we walk over
5537960	5539720	and take our spots with these candles.
5539720	5540120	All right.
5540120	5541560	Well, they're chanting.
5541560	5542920	It's like a ritual.
5542920	5545080	You see there's all sorts of magical reagents
5545080	5547240	on the floor forming a sort of spell circle
5547240	5548280	or summoning ritual.
5549160	5551240	There's some kind of detect magic real quick
5551240	5552600	before this gets out of hand.
5552600	5555160	I think you might have detect magic.
5555160	5555720	Okay, good.
5555720	5556600	I'd like to do that.
5556600	5558440	I'm going to say you're about 80 feet off
5558440	5560440	unless you want to like define your approach differently.
5560440	5563960	I'm going to sneak up after all that exuberance.
5563960	5565160	I'm just going to sneak behind
5565160	5567800	and see if this is as bad as it sounds.
5567800	5571080	All right, you rolled it like with bonuses at 25.
5571080	5572680	So you're real stealthing right now.
5574520	5575640	So you're sneaking up.
5578680	5579480	I forgot the other.
5579480	5581400	What are you trying to do once you're snuck up?
5581400	5583320	I would like to detect like that.
5583320	5583640	I don't know.
5583640	5584600	I don't know all the things.
5584600	5585400	Oh, yeah, okay.
5585400	5588440	I want to find out if this is really shitty or cool.
5588440	5590040	Yeah, you detect some magic
5590040	5593400	and it seems like serious demon gate opening magic.
5594760	5595260	Okay.
5599720	5601960	The kind that makes demons come to earth.
5601960	5603960	Yeah, don't want to don't want to say
5603960	5605480	that I don't have any spells out loud,
5605480	5606840	but I think you already remembered that.
5606840	5608360	So at this point, I was looking.
5608360	5609480	Oh, a precursor.
5609480	5611880	I was looking back at Carlos the Unimagined saying.
5612920	5614360	Yeah, we were just bonding
5614360	5616680	about how we don't have any spells left.
5616680	5617880	No, so you don't either.
5617880	5618360	Yeah.
5618360	5619880	So the guys that might have something
5619880	5621240	are just doing jumping jacks.
5621240	5622440	Those are the guys that you don't want.
5622440	5624120	Yeah, I like your style.
5625400	5625640	Yeah.
5626440	5628440	By the way, Cultie Town.
5629480	5630920	Yeah, Cultie Path.
5630920	5632040	Cultie World.
5632040	5632920	Yeah, it seems like it.
5635320	5635800	Nope.
5636680	5637320	Look.
5637320	5638920	Hey, get over it.
5639480	5640280	Come over here.
5640280	5641400	We're holding candles.
5643000	5644280	What are you even trying?
5644280	5647160	These guys are trying to open a gate to hell.
5648200	5651400	We need to rest and we need to get on with our mission.
5651400	5652280	What are you doing?
5652280	5653160	Do you even know what you're doing?
5653160	5654920	We're trying to find some leads.
5654920	5656680	We're getting some sick clothes, bro.
5656680	5658040	You don't even know what you're doing.
5658040	5663480	Like you're playing like it's like Stardew Valley.
5663480	5664520	Like you just run into people
5664520	5665960	and you just fucking interact with them.
5665960	5667320	All right, fine, fine.
5667320	5669240	I go up to the guy who gave me the candle
5669240	5670520	and I give it back and I said,
5670520	5671560	I'm really sorry, man.
5671560	5673400	It's like Stardew Valley here.
5674680	5677160	And it's not what I signed up for.
5677160	5679000	I hope I don't, you know, you can,
5679000	5680120	I didn't light it yet.
5680120	5683480	So, but, you know, it's the Stardew Valley shit
5683480	5685400	that's really bumming us out.
5685400	5686920	So we're going to just like take off.
5688760	5689160	Okay.
5689880	5691720	But good luck with whatever you're doing here.
5691720	5693000	It seems cool.
5693000	5694200	It's just not our thing.
5694200	5696440	You see a blot of shadow widened
5696440	5698520	at the center of the circle in the ground
5698520	5702440	that forms a scar or a rip in the earth
5702440	5707080	out of which a massive clawed hand thrusts itself.
5707080	5709240	Like I said, we got to get out of here.
5711240	5712200	Cliffhanger.
5712200	5712600	All right.
5712600	5713720	That's it for the show.
5715000	5716040	Thanks for joining us.
5718360	5718840	All right.
5720040	5720920	Caitlin Chase.
5721640	5722600	Thank you so much.
5722760	5724760	Thank you so much.
5724760	5727880	Somebody make sure, I want you, I want you escorted.
5729320	5729800	Yeah.
5729800	5731240	Well, no, maybe.
5731240	5734600	Yeah, somebody, somebody get Caitlin down with.
5734600	5740040	Hey, can we put a link to the John Schnapp GoFundMe page
5741160	5744680	up on the Honda Town tweet or whatever,
5744680	5750600	because like there's even the amount of bills that
5750600	5752040	also what Lorraine was saying is
5752120	5756280	that John Schnapp's wife who like her mom
5756280	5757480	recently died and stuff too.
5757480	5759640	So I assume there's a GoFundMe that like to help her out.
5759640	5762840	There's a GoFundMe that I'll link to.
5762840	5764440	It's already linked, but I'll link it again.
5764440	5766040	Yeah, we'll link to it again right now.
5766040	5767080	That's a good reminder.
5767080	5767560	Okay, great.
5767560	5769160	Yeah, anything you can help there.
5770120	5771880	The insurance is not covered.
5771880	5773240	Yeah, we missed you, John.
5773240	5776200	Yeah, we, yeah.
5776200	5777880	Sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm sorry.
5779000	5780040	Like, yeah, sorry.
5780040	5781560	I don't know how to cope with death.
5781560	5781880	Sorry.
5783960	5785640	He's a good guy and I'll miss him.
5788120	5789240	And we could go at any time.
5790360	5791720	And there's no shame in that.
5791720	5792200	Yeah.
5792200	5793640	It should actually be an invitation.
5794280	5794840	Wait for it.
5796600	5797960	It builds to an amazing ending.
5797960	5798520	Yeah.
5800520	5803240	We could die at any time.
5812360	5814200	Do we usually do stuff?
5814200	5815320	Yeah, I don't know what we do.
5816680	5818440	We've done 350 shows.
5818440	5819640	We've never ended a single one.
5819640	5819720	Thank you, Zach.
5819720	5820440	Cue the music.
5821640	5822120	All right.
5823000	5823880	Thanks, everybody.
5824680	5826680	Thank you all for coming out tonight.
5826680	5828280	Good night, folks.
5828280	5829240	We'll see you next week.
5829880	5831800	Thank you very much for coming out tonight.
5832600	5837640	We want to thank Zach, Nolan, Chris, Sarah, Kevin, Spencer.
5854600	5856200	Did you get any of that?
5857800	5859640	It's a good show.
