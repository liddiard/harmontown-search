0	29480	Hello everybody, welcome to Meltdown Comics from Hollywood, California, the Nerd Melt Leader.
29480	32480	Harbontown is now in session.
32480	44480	Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harbontown, Dan Harbont.
44480	55480	Thank you, welcome, welcome back.
55480	66480	So we were in Austin, I have a little cold, nothing contagious, everyone that has a cold is an expert at that.
66480	75480	Definitely not going to get you sick. If you're wondering why I sound a little more like Willie Nelson or David Duchovny, now you know why.
75480	81480	I'm looking at my phone, I'm looking at the shit we've got to get through, because we've got all kinds of friends coming to talk to us.
81480	90480	We're going to do the southwest south, southwest south, the south by southwest breakdown with our friend Kumail, who we didn't get to see out there.
90480	97480	But I want to bring him out as soon as possible and just kind of download with him about Austin.
97480	107480	Kumail's photo was everywhere, on the back of the pedicab, his little bicycle rickshaw thing, you could not move a muscle without seeing Kumail's gorgeous little face everywhere.
107480	112480	Because he's in this HBO thing, they're promoting the hell out of it down there. It was Orwellian.
112480	113480	Did the community ever get that?
113480	119480	At the exact place where you're taking off your shoes and having your ass searched by the TSA, Kumail nudged his head.
119480	122480	It's like staring over you in Austin.
122480	124480	Casting a wry glance at you.
124480	130480	But before we get there, we don't want to torture him by talking about that while he's in the wings.
130480	135480	But I just wanted to, you know, here's our pop culture minute.
135480	138480	Pop culture minute.
143480	149480	Well, there's some things everyone is talking about, but they're not of any actual import.
149480	154480	But everybody's talking about that because we live in a hive mind.
155480	170480	This hive mind thing and its relationship with our individual lives and also the things that actually are important kind of intersect with this concept today,
170480	183480	this news that I woke to this morning on Twitter that Fred Phelps, the West Baptist Church fellow who's famous for its God hates bags slogan, that he's on his deathbed.
183480	189480	The reason we get that news is because his son said something on Facebook in the same Facebook message.
189480	202480	His son, his son threw out the idea that Fred Phelps had been excommunicated from the West Baptist Church for Westboro Baptist Church for a year more.
202480	207480	I started doing like a little Nancy Drew Googling because I was like, what do you mean he was excommunicated?
208480	218480	I should care about more important things. I should be Googling how to give Africa clean water and figuring it out.
218480	225480	But instead I spent a good 40 minutes today going like, well, when did Fred Phelps get excommunicated? What does that mean?
226480	238480	It's just really interesting to me. There's a lot of straight gay advocates on Twitter today and I'm not taking anything away from them.
238480	241480	I'm not going to high road people who are high roading people.
245480	252480	This is a great chance for everybody to spike a football on the grave of an absolutely unrepentant homophobe.
252480	260480	Somebody who is the lightning rod for everything that we say is the reason why we need to be progressive.
260480	267480	Like the whole idea. And then you start peeling back the layers and you go, why was this guy famous?
267480	277480	I started reading blogs by advocates and gay bloggers. I thought that would be funnier than it was.
282480	296480	This sort of spirit rose through the lard that was like, okay, let's do what this guy didn't do. Let's not pick at his funeral.
296480	303480	Let's look at this guy for what he was. He was a crazy old man. He had a congregation of about 11.
303480	311480	And I think the reason why he was famous is because we all have this sort of impulse in our minds to protect ourselves and each other.
311480	322480	And where has he been since this excommunication? This is the point where I'll invite anybody who knows more about this than I do.
322480	327480	I just want to dump what I know on the table so that you're not coming up for no reason.
327480	340480	But was he excommunicated possibly because he found out he was dying and like most people wanted to just say before he went out, sorry.
340480	349480	I fucked up. I did that because I was angry. And no matter how many times I tell you, you're not going to live forever.
349480	352480	I realized right at the end that this is no joke.
352480	359480	You're saying that his church might have excommunicated him because he repented about not being homophobic?
359480	368480	These are the weird things is that his son, who's long since out of the church, like all of his sons, I believe, Facebook, his Facebook entry said,
368480	378480	well, my dad is on his deathbed and he's been excommunicated for a year. And in the body of that Facebook entry,
379480	389480	comments on the idea that the family won't let anyone talk to this guy, that they won't let anyone who's also excommunicated talk to him.
389480	397480	That's what made me go, what's going on here? This is all just gossip and garbage. This isn't news.
397480	404480	Excommunicated would be to not be as homophobic as you're supposed to be, like to come back on that stand.
405480	409480	That's what I'm asking, like the guy, the God hates fags.
409480	418480	Colonel Sanders is sick and dying and was apparently excommunicated a while ago.
418480	424480	And no one can talk to him, including people who have also been excommunicated, which he is.
424480	428480	That's what I kept trying to untangle that. And I spent 40 minutes and then I gave up.
428480	436480	So does anybody in the audience able to untangle any of that? Okay, I see three heads shaking.
436480	445480	So that's good. Now we imbue it with our mythology, which I believe is probably the uplifting part of that.
445480	447480	Somewhere there's an old man dying.
447480	451480	Because at a properly functioning church, you get excommunicated for saying the things that he said.
451480	458480	Your theory is that he might have been excommunicated because he stopped toeing the party line and stopped being a...
458480	461480	Here's my theory. It's not based on science at all. I don't care.
461480	467480	Because I'm a fan of story and character and mythology. This isn't news. This is gossip.
467480	477480	This guy was only ever famous. God bless everyone who made him famous because this whole thing furthered, in my opinion.
478480	488480	It's a catalyst that fires up gay rights advocacy when you look at somebody standing outside a Navy funeral with a sign that says God hates fags.
488480	495480	That was the whole point of this. It was iconography. This person didn't have tanks outside of Poland.
495480	501480	This person had a couple of fucking rednecks hanging out with him in his living room. And that was his congregation.
502480	511480	But the interesting story about this, as he lies on his deathbed, is he dying in isolation?
511480	516480	Does he actually want to say to somebody that he's sorry?
516480	524480	Is he being denied that? That's what's crazy to me. That's what's fascinating.
524480	526480	We have to find out. I hate mysteries.
527480	531480	We have that and the Malaysian plane looming over our heads right now.
531480	533480	Malaysian plane segment!
535480	537480	Play the Malaysian pink.
542480	547480	There's a plane that was flying and it disappeared and nobody knows where it went.
547480	552480	It's the new balloon boy. It's the Malaysian plane.
553480	557480	But it's more tragic because real human lives are happening.
558480	560480	Do you remember the balloon boy?
563480	568480	Here's the part of the balloon boy thing that I didn't remember and never knew about.
568480	574480	I was busy. I was making TV history somewhere when balloon boy was happening.
574480	580480	I was floating over the tree tops of Fox having a pitch meeting.
581480	589480	There's a balloon boy. There's a boy in the balloon and the balloon is floating all around.
589480	595480	I saw you shake your head at the audience and I know you guys are all against me.
597480	599480	We were watching the balloon.
599480	600480	You're the balloon boy.
600480	602480	You're the balloon boy!
602480	610480	There's a Rick and Morty writer pulled this up on the YouTubes and showed us.
610480	612480	Do you guys remember when this happened?
612480	614480	I think it was CNN.
616480	620480	The moment when it broke that the balloon boy thing was a hoax.
620480	625480	A deliberate hoax. Not a hoax on the part of the kid but an engineered hoax on the part of the dad.
625480	628480	I didn't remember any of this. I didn't care about the balloon boy.
629480	632480	You're busy during certain public events.
632480	634480	He was never in the balloon, right?
634480	635480	He was never in the balloon.
635480	636480	Then the dad was like...
636480	638480	There's a news clip.
638480	641480	Has everyone seen the...
641480	644480	Yeah, but with the fart?
646480	649480	I didn't know anything about this.
649480	652480	Kumail's shaking his head so that's good enough for me.
653480	656480	Are you shaking your head going,
656480	659480	Why are you trucking out the balloon boy?
661480	663480	No, I don't know what the fart thing is.
663480	665480	Okay, good. That's what I thought.
665480	668480	Later on tonight, Kumail Nangiani will be our guest.
668480	670480	I have another reason to be upset.
670480	673480	You now have a better Kumail impression than I do.
673480	675480	That was spur of the moment.
675480	677480	That was pretty good.
678480	680480	You walk a fucking tightrope,
680480	682480	you do a Kumail impression because...
683480	686480	Kumail's career has become a monument
686480	688480	to not fucking selling out,
688480	691480	not trading on the things that make him different
691480	693480	from the people that are watching.
693480	694480	You know what I mean?
694480	696480	I don't know about articulating that well enough.
696480	698480	I remember early on him coming out
698480	700480	and every conversation I had with him talking about,
700480	702480	Oh yeah, I'll go for this audition.
702480	703480	I won't go for that one.
703480	705480	Here's the meticulous reason why.
706480	709480	The fact that it pays off if you're smart
709480	710480	and actually furthers...
710480	712480	Anyway, I'm embarrassing him.
713480	715480	So the last thing you want to do is reward all of that
715480	716480	by going like,
716480	718480	Oh, I'm Kumail, look at me!
719480	723480	But that will be the end result of everything.
723480	725480	Because if he becomes Woody Allen, then what happens?
725480	728480	Oh, I'm Kumail, look at me!
728480	729480	You celebrate someone's...
729480	731480	Was that Kumail or Woody Allen?
732480	735480	So just Google this, find it.
735480	737480	They're on a couch, right?
737480	738480	They're all on a couch.
738480	740480	They're all on a couch in a row.
740480	742480	And the dad is like,
742480	744480	Hey, why didn't you...
744480	746480	The CNN wants to know.
746480	748480	Why didn't you come out when you were hiding?
748480	749480	And the kid goes like,
749480	754480	Hi, you told us that it was for the show?
754480	756480	And the dad goes...
757480	758480	And then there's this...
758480	764480	And you can spend three hours watching it,
764480	768480	debating whether it's the kid or the dad that's farting.
771480	773480	It's really, really great.
773480	775480	And I just think there was a lot going on in the world
775480	778480	and also a lot going on during that CNN satellite interview.
778480	780480	So it just kind of slipped by us.
780480	782480	It wasn't like the fart heard around the world.
782480	783480	It really needs...
783480	785480	We need to go back.
785480	787480	Were there charges filed or pressed?
788480	791480	Did someone go to jail or get fined for that?
791480	792480	Like for wasting our time?
792480	793480	Is that one of those things?
793480	794480	There's no...
794480	795480	Yes, actually.
795480	796480	They had to pay restitution.
796480	798480	I think I looked it up on Wikipedia.
798480	801480	I think they had to give a little bit of restitution.
801480	802480	No, wait, did they?
802480	805480	Restitution.
805480	807480	No, I think I'm mixing something else up.
807480	809480	Because I think CNN...
809480	811480	You know what?
811480	813480	I just high-fived Kumail.
813480	815480	You know what I picture happening
815480	817480	in the parking lot of that whole event?
817480	822480	Is the government coming up to a circus of news cameramen
822480	824480	and producers and going like,
824480	825480	anybody want to press charges?
825480	828480	And they're like, no, we're good.
828480	830480	We did it.
830480	831480	What is the...
831480	833480	We got everything out of this we would have gotten
833480	835480	if a baby had been in a balloon.
835480	837480	That's what's for sale.
837480	838480	Buy Snickers.
838480	839480	Good night.
839480	840480	How does...
840480	842480	I mean, look, this is a stupid question to ask.
842480	845480	How does a plane disappear in a world full of surveillance,
845480	847480	a big-ass plane full of human beings?
847480	849480	How do they not fucking know?
849480	850480	I don't know.
850480	851480	Let Rob Delaney talk about that.
851480	854480	What was your conspiracy theory earlier?
854480	856480	Oh, my theory...
856480	857480	Okay, come on.
857480	859480	No, but that was over drinks.
859480	860480	I don't know.
860480	864480	Is it politically incorrect right now to be making bits about...
864480	867480	People are gone dead.
867480	869480	These are human beings.
869480	871480	It's in poor taste, right, to do bits.
871480	875480	I wouldn't call it a bit about the tragedy of these people dying.
875480	876480	We're just...
876480	877480	I don't know.
877480	878480	I was just...
878480	879480	No, yeah, no.
879480	880480	But my bit is specifically hint.
880480	881480	Never mind.
881480	882480	It was a sci-fi conceit.
882480	883480	That's all.
883480	884480	Everyone's thinking about it.
884480	888480	You were saying that as a fetishist of storytelling...
888480	891480	Over drinks we were saying this.
891480	896480	But as a fetishist of story and story structure and character
896480	899480	that you can't help but project onto this...
900480	903480	Like a guy in goggles coming in the cockpit and going,
903480	907480	listen, you have to take this plane down.
907480	912480	There's a guy in E3 that's going to give birth to Hitler.
912480	915480	New Hitler.
915480	916480	Nose dive now.
916480	917480	And then the whole...
917480	919480	There was this, you know...
919480	920480	It's not funny.
920480	922480	People die.
922480	923480	Shame on you.
923480	925480	Because originally it wasn't New Hitler.
925480	928480	It was the guy who was going to give birth to Space Aids.
929480	932480	I changed...
932480	936480	I haven't even typed a word of this yet.
936480	937480	All right.
937480	941480	So I want to thank Greg and Charles for buying me a drink at the drawing room.
941480	942480	They came here from San Jose.
942480	943480	Everybody comes out.
943480	946480	There's always a pilgrimage that comes out here.
946480	947480	Hey, Greg, are you here?
947480	948480	Yeah.
948480	949480	All right.
949480	950480	Hi, Greg.
950480	951480	Good.
951480	954480	Greg and Charles drove five hours from San Jose.
954480	955480	I'm sure...
955480	956480	Who else drove further?
956480	957480	Who drove further?
958480	959480	San Francisco.
959480	960480	San Francisco?
960480	961480	Sacramento.
961480	962480	Sacramento.
962480	963480	You guys...
963480	965480	But now we get into what you drove here for.
965480	967480	And those guys drove here for how it's...
967480	970480	Anybody here from a Malaysian flight 441?
970480	972480	To me it's not funny.
972480	973480	To Jeff it is.
973480	975480	I want that on record.
975480	976480	For TMZ.
976480	978480	That's a different flight number.
978480	979480	Is it right?
979480	981480	Did I get it right?
981480	982480	370.
982480	983480	Yeah.
983480	986480	The 370, that's not funny.
986480	991480	Flight 441 landed safely in Beijing hours ago.
991480	993480	All right.
993480	998480	Thank you, Greg and Charles, for buying me a drink at the drawing room before the show.
998480	1000480	Everybody that drove here tonight...
1000480	1001480	Sorry.
1001480	1002480	It's $10.
1002480	1004480	What the fuck do you want?
1004480	1007480	How about that Fred Phelps?
1007480	1013480	So let's do our next segment, our regular annual segment,
1013480	1017480	South by Southwest Breakdown with Camille Nogianni!
1025480	1026480	Hello, hello.
1029480	1030480	Hello, hello.
1030480	1031480	Yeah.
1033480	1034480	How's it going, guys?
1034480	1035480	It's going good.
1035480	1037480	Sorry, I mean we're so accustomed to you.
1037480	1039480	The first thing you say is, can I just say this?
1039480	1041480	Oh, no.
1041480	1042480	Can I just say...
1042480	1043480	This is me!
1043480	1044480	I'm Camille!
1045480	1046480	Hey, everybody!
1046480	1047480	Hey, everybody!
1049480	1051480	No, I don't...
1051480	1054480	I bet that's not what Fred Phelps' thing is, unfortunately.
1054480	1055480	I'm sure he's just...
1055480	1057480	His brain is gone.
1057480	1058480	And so they don't...
1058480	1059480	Why would they excommunicate him?
1059480	1062480	Why wouldn't they deify him and put him under a glass?
1062480	1065480	Because he's probably crazy and shitting his pants or something.
1065480	1066480	But that's not...
1066480	1067480	That's not...
1067480	1068480	Why would they excommunicate him?
1068480	1069480	That's such a specific...
1069480	1070480	That's a specific...
1071480	1072480	You know what?
1072480	1073480	This may all be based on some weird...
1073480	1077480	This one thing that his one kid said on Facebook.
1077480	1080480	And now it's been added to his Wikipedia.
1080480	1081480	Oh, yeah.
1081480	1082480	Because we don't actually know.
1082480	1085480	I keep Googling Fred Phelps' excommunication.
1085480	1086480	And there's nothing...
1086480	1090480	The only thing that's there is this continual reference to the fact that his kid said that.
1090480	1091480	Yeah.
1091480	1092480	I won't say...
1092480	1094480	I've never been sexually attracted to a guy.
1094480	1097480	But I will make out with a dude at his funeral.
1098480	1100480	I thought you were going to say, I would fuck Fred Phelps.
1100480	1101480	I would...
1101480	1103480	If he's up for it.
1103480	1106480	I mean, I'll take that hit for everybody.
1106480	1108480	What if he comes out before he dies?
1108480	1110480	I mean, that would be pretty important.
1110480	1111480	What if that was it?
1111480	1112480	That would be so good.
1112480	1113480	Yeah.
1113480	1115480	Would it be the biggest shock in the world?
1115480	1120480	Or would it be like the third, fourth, eighth biggest shock in the history of...
1120480	1126480	With my brief Googling, he was a lawyer and he was a civil rights activist.
1127480	1128480	He was?
1128480	1129480	He was a Democrat.
1129480	1130480	He was a civil rights activist?
1130480	1132480	Something happened to this guy.
1132480	1141480	Something happens to everyone who decides that, in addition to letting gay people just be alienated by virtue of being gay,
1141480	1143480	that you actually have to go after them.
1143480	1146480	Something has to happen to you to pick on gay people.
1146480	1148480	At funerals, soldiers have died.
1148480	1150480	That's such a long connection to make.
1150480	1157480	Because the connection is that wars are God's way of punishing homosexuality in our sins.
1157480	1160480	So the people who go to war...
1160480	1161480	What's the logic?
1161480	1162480	Does anyone know what the logic is?
1162480	1165480	Because he's not protesting funerals of gay people.
1165480	1168480	He's protesting soldiers who've died in wars.
1168480	1169480	Some holdover...
1169480	1171480	Yeah, it wasn't gay soldiers, right?
1171480	1172480	It wasn't gay soldiers.
1172480	1176480	It's something like a war happens because gays.
1176480	1178480	So if we go to...
1178480	1181480	And it's weirdly, I think, supporting the dead soldiers.
1181480	1184480	Like, hey, if we didn't have gays, your son would still be alive.
1184480	1186480	Like, it's some weird logic like that.
1186480	1187480	I didn't know that.
1187480	1188480	I always assumed it was right.
1188480	1189480	That's right, right?
1189480	1191480	I mean, it's wrong, but it's right.
1192480	1194480	It's so wrong, it's right.
1194480	1196480	Somebody back there feels pretty strong and that's right.
1196480	1197480	Yeah.
1197480	1198480	Feels right.
1198480	1199480	Feels right.
1199480	1200480	What a long...
1200480	1201480	What a pitch meeting where he's like,
1201480	1202480	Listen, guys, I got an idea.
1202480	1204480	You have to stay with me.
1205480	1207480	It's a long way to get there.
1207480	1208480	Go long.
1209480	1210480	Yeah, go long.
1210480	1212480	Hold up both hands.
1212480	1213480	Good luck.
1213480	1215480	I went down a rabbit hole today,
1215480	1217480	because the first thing that happens is the Twitter jokes.
1217480	1218480	Wait, what's happening?
1218480	1219480	I might be wrong.
1219480	1220480	It's wrong.
1222480	1224480	I have a really strong source right here.
1224480	1225480	Okay, well, what is it?
1225480	1226480	Why does he...
1226480	1227480	My boss is here.
1227480	1228480	Three months.
1228480	1229480	What is it?
1229480	1232480	It's because soldiers are fighting for this country
1232480	1234480	and this country is supporting gay people.
1234480	1235480	Oh, okay.
1235480	1236480	Right, yeah.
1236480	1237480	Okay, so it's sort of similar.
1237480	1239480	She said soldiers are supporting this country
1239480	1241480	and this country supports gay people, so...
1241480	1242480	Right.
1242480	1244480	You're gay by association.
1245480	1247480	So it is anti the soldiers that are dying.
1247480	1249480	Yeah, they deserve to die
1249480	1251480	because they support you gay vote in our country.
1251480	1252480	Wow.
1252480	1253480	Fag enablers, he says.
1253480	1254480	Fag enablers.
1254480	1255480	Fag enablers?
1255480	1257480	He calls soldiers fag enablers?
1257480	1258480	What?
1258480	1260480	Fag enablers is actually the name of my battle bot.
1261480	1264480	And I don't know if you guys remember when I was...
1264480	1266480	I was a contender in battle bots.
1266480	1267480	You did pretty well, right?
1267480	1268480	Fag enablers.
1268480	1269480	I never meant it to be pronounced that way.
1269480	1270480	Yeah.
1270480	1271480	It's for enablers.
1271480	1272480	Yeah.
1272480	1273480	It was, yeah.
1273480	1275480	Her doctor fag enablers.
1275480	1276480	Yeah.
1277480	1281480	In the UK, they just thought it was a guy who sold cigarettes to minors.
1282480	1285480	I went down a brief rabbit hole.
1285480	1288480	I think the internet is such a beautiful pudding of hatred
1288480	1290480	and toxicity and juvenile...
1290480	1293480	...juvenility and outrage and reflex.
1293480	1297480	And then these beautiful clouds and streaks of,
1297480	1300480	oh my God, we're all going to be fine.
1300480	1308480	Just went down the rabbit hole of a lot of wonderful blog essays
1308480	1317480	from gay people whose straight friends are absolutely justified.
1318480	1321480	They're probably taking the opportunity to go,
1321480	1324480	yeah, burn in hell, you fucking fag hater.
1325480	1328480	But who personally just want to take the time to say,
1328480	1331480	you know, just we're the same.
1331480	1333480	Not to cast aspersions.
1333480	1335480	I appreciate the advocacy.
1335480	1337480	I appreciate the support.
1339480	1343480	This is just an old senile man who was pushed to the forefront in the media
1343480	1347480	because of an agenda that needs to be made conscious of.
1347480	1353480	And to hate each other for anything is always the wrong answer.
1353480	1357480	But I also understand, like, if you're gay and you're persecuted
1357480	1361480	and there's a guy who's protesting soldiers' funerals because they're fag enablers,
1361480	1364480	I mean, I can understand someone being really angry about it.
1364480	1366480	Everyone has permission to do it.
1366480	1370480	Nobody is going to punish you for doing it.
1370480	1372480	So what do you do in that moment?
1372480	1377480	Nobody is going to judge you for stabbing this guy in the face.
1377480	1379480	So here's your knife.
1379480	1380480	What is he dying of?
1380480	1382480	What are you going to do?
1382480	1384480	I guess it's just...
1384480	1386480	I don't know the details, huh?
1386480	1388480	Yeah, he got space hands.
1388480	1390480	He got space hands.
1390480	1392480	I was trying to think of what the joke would be.
1392480	1393480	I'm like, what am I doing?
1393480	1394480	I couldn't think of the joke either.
1394480	1396480	There's a Sudoku puzzle in my chest.
1396480	1397480	It's hard.
1397480	1399480	I was like, do we know how he's dying?
1399480	1400480	Is he dead? Is he hanging on?
1400480	1401480	He's super old.
1401480	1403480	I think he's just dying because...
1403480	1405480	Because the ravages of time.
1405480	1406480	The ravages of time, yeah.
1406480	1407480	And space aids.
1407480	1408480	Yeah.
1408480	1409480	Yeah.
1409480	1410480	All right.
1410480	1411480	Enough about this asshole.
1411480	1415480	If we talk about him a second longer than Harold Ramis, I'll fucking kill myself.
1415480	1417480	Then the world is committed to crime.
1417480	1418480	Yeah.
1418480	1420480	I wasn't here when you guys talked about Harold Ramis.
1420480	1421480	That was...
1421480	1423480	I had this weird thing.
1423480	1426480	So I did this podcast called The Indoor Kids with Emily,
1426480	1427480	and I started talking about...
1427480	1428480	Oh, thank you.
1429480	1430480	Harold Ramis.
1430480	1432480	And I started crying, and I couldn't stop crying.
1432480	1434480	And I figured out...
1434480	1435480	It was because...
1435480	1437480	And I told this story there.
1437480	1439480	Do we want to talk about Harold Ramis again?
1439480	1440480	Sure.
1440480	1441480	No.
1441480	1442480	Yeah.
1442480	1443480	Okay.
1443480	1444480	So this happened...
1444480	1445480	I want to see you cry.
1445480	1446480	I'm not going to cry.
1446480	1448480	Watch me not cry, motherfuckers.
1448480	1449480	Already.
1449480	1450480	It's hard.
1450480	1451480	No.
1451480	1453480	Because obviously I love Ghostbusters and stuff, but...
1453480	1455480	He's already crying.
1455480	1457480	Yes, I'm crying out.
1458480	1459480	Groundhog Day.
1459480	1460480	I love that movie.
1460480	1463480	And just sort of a weird story, but stick with it,
1463480	1464480	because it's...
1464480	1465480	She's okay now.
1465480	1466480	But when Emily and I first started dating,
1466480	1468480	she got really sick, and it was like this weird,
1468480	1469480	mysterious thing.
1469480	1471480	And we'd only been dating a few months,
1471480	1472480	and she was in a coma for eight days.
1472480	1473480	It's a crazy...
1473480	1475480	Yeah, it's sort of out of nowhere.
1475480	1476480	Did you hit her?
1476480	1477480	Huh?
1477480	1478480	While she was in a coma,
1478480	1480480	then she was not learning her lesson.
1483480	1484480	Wow.
1484480	1486480	That was a roller coaster of...
1487480	1488480	Yeah.
1488480	1490480	And that's the story I wanted to tell.
1493480	1495480	I hope somebody was recording that exchange.
1495480	1497480	We're making Hollywood Squares.
1498480	1500480	A new comedy Golden Age.
1500480	1502480	They want to move me to Center Square
1502480	1503480	because of that exchange.
1503480	1504480	They're like,
1504480	1506480	we're getting Bruce Valanche out of there.
1508480	1509480	So she got really sick,
1509480	1511480	and it was crazy to be only been dating a few months,
1511480	1512480	and...
1512480	1513480	Oh, God.
1513480	1514480	Her parents...
1515480	1516480	Her parents and I hung out for a while,
1516480	1518480	and that's when I sort of told my parents
1518480	1520480	that I wasn't going to marry the woman
1520480	1521480	that they found for me,
1521480	1522480	that it was going to be this woman
1522480	1523480	who's in a coma,
1523480	1524480	who's hopefully going to come out,
1524480	1525480	and if she comes out,
1525480	1526480	I'm going to marry her.
1526480	1527480	And if she doesn't,
1527480	1529480	well, then the world ends anyway.
1529480	1530480	Oh, God.
1530480	1531480	Okay.
1531480	1532480	But when she finally came out,
1532480	1533480	and she was fine,
1533480	1534480	and the first night I got to stay
1534480	1535480	in the hospital with her,
1535480	1536480	and she was up,
1536480	1538480	I was allowed to bring in a laptop,
1538480	1539480	and I was like,
1539480	1540480	what movie do we want to watch?
1540480	1541480	And she was like,
1541480	1542480	Groundhog Day.
1542480	1543480	And it was so profound
1543480	1545480	because every day I've been at the hospital
1545480	1546480	all day every day,
1546480	1548480	so I sort of was living Groundhog Day.
1548480	1549480	Like, it was the same day over and over,
1549480	1551480	but I remember watching this movie
1551480	1553480	with Emily, who's up now,
1553480	1554480	and being like,
1554480	1555480	oh, everything's going to be okay.
1555480	1558480	So, you know, you sort of connect to people
1558480	1559480	because of the things they've done,
1559480	1561480	but that was like a very special thing for me.
1561480	1563480	So when he sort of died,
1563480	1565480	that really like hit me.
1566480	1568480	Not hard, but in a way, I was like,
1568480	1569480	oh, that guy had a profound effect
1569480	1572480	on both our lives in a way that he never really...
1572480	1574480	He doesn't know, you know?
1574480	1575480	He has no idea what that means.
1575480	1576480	Yeah, it was never really...
1576480	1577480	It wasn't one of the...
1577480	1580480	The people whose impact we acknowledge
1580480	1582480	while they're alive...
1582480	1583480	Yeah.
1583480	1585480	I don't know what their deal is,
1585480	1587480	but I know that the really important people
1587480	1590480	are the people who unexpectedly,
1590480	1593480	like that blanket is slipped out from underneath us
1593480	1595480	and suddenly everything is disrupted.
1595480	1596480	Yeah.
1596480	1598480	And I know, I've confessed to this,
1598480	1600480	I know this is all narcissism and all ego,
1600480	1602480	but how else are you supposed to process someone else's death?
1602480	1603480	Right.
1603480	1605480	But I've had...
1605480	1606480	Yeah, whatever.
1606480	1607480	I'm repeating myself,
1607480	1609480	but I'm walking down a sidewalk in Burbank
1609480	1610480	and I'm just processing this
1610480	1612480	and the way I do every celebrity death
1612480	1614480	and like, what does this mean to me?
1614480	1615480	Why was he important?
1615480	1618480	And then all of a sudden, I'm just fucking weeping.
1618480	1619480	Yeah.
1619480	1621480	And it was definitely because
1621480	1625480	this was a purveyor of...
1625480	1628480	I mean, like Groundhog Day is...
1628480	1632480	It should definitely be put in a canister
1632480	1634480	and shot toward other planets
1634480	1638480	because it's the best we can do in a modern civilization
1638480	1644480	of creating a new...
1644480	1646480	I mean, there's creation myths,
1646480	1648480	but then there's the part of mythology
1648480	1653480	that just tells you, like,
1653480	1656480	soothes you, like reminds you that everything's fucked
1656480	1659480	and that you need to be who you are,
1659480	1662480	and it's a story about God holding a man still
1662480	1665480	until he can't stop,
1665480	1667480	until he can't squirm anymore
1667480	1670480	and you just watch it happen,
1670480	1672480	and what's amazing about that movie
1672480	1676480	is that any hokey-er movie
1676480	1683480	would have easily gotten away with ending the story with him
1683480	1685480	just becoming a good guy to her
1685480	1687480	and learning her favorite color,
1687480	1689480	and I've got ice cream on the windowsill,
1689480	1693480	and in that movie, that's where shit really goes bad
1693480	1695480	because he's really become an asshole now
1695480	1697480	because it's one thing to rob a bank
1697480	1700480	and it's one thing to eat all the M&Ms you want,
1700480	1705480	but it's another thing to fucking fabricate
1705480	1707480	the spark between one human and another,
1707480	1710480	and then he leaves that rom-com world
1710480	1712480	and he just takes piano lessons
1712480	1715480	and he just catches the same cat out on the same tree
1715480	1717480	and blah, blah, blah, and it's at that point
1717480	1720480	that he actually has something with her.
1720480	1721480	Anyways, all right, so...
1721480	1723480	That's the way he's trying to save the homeless men
1723480	1725480	from dying over and over.
1725480	1727480	That's such a great, like, moment.
1727480	1729480	I mean, that's a fantastic...
1729480	1732480	I mean, if aliens attack us and they want to kill us,
1732480	1735480	we show them Groundhog Day and give them Nutella
1735480	1739480	and they'll be like, all right, you guys have done good.
1739480	1741480	There should be theologians who study that
1741480	1746480	who ask things like, does he save the homeless guy
1746480	1748480	after a certain point?
1748480	1750480	The story would indicate that he learned the lesson
1750480	1752480	that that guy's just going to freeze to death
1752480	1754480	and start the death of the sidewalk
1754480	1756480	and you tried everything there,
1756480	1758480	so you got a piano lesson and just do it.
1758480	1760480	They don't dwell on that.
1760480	1763480	It's a more uplifting movie than that,
1763480	1765480	but those are also...
1765480	1766480	That's what I'm saying.
1766480	1768480	You could launch that movie to Mars
1768480	1770480	and start a civilization based on it,
1770480	1772480	and then a new generation could say,
1772480	1774480	well, did he save the homeless guy every time?
1774480	1776480	And then you could go, well, you know,
1776480	1779480	some people say he did, but other people...
1779480	1780480	You know what?
1780480	1784480	If you've got a piano lesson, you need to learn piano.
1784480	1786480	That's going to help more people.
1786480	1788480	I want to see a sequel to that movie
1788480	1790480	where it's just him, like, dazzling people
1790480	1792480	by making ice sculptures,
1792480	1794480	and they're like, where did you find the time?
1794480	1796480	There's a comic book series
1796480	1798480	where time unfreezes a different time for him,
1798480	1800480	and so there's, like, different Bill Murrays
1800480	1802480	who are, like, champion ice sculptors.
1802480	1803480	Yeah.
1803480	1805480	Or, like, what if it ended too early
1805480	1807480	and he was, like, halfway good,
1807480	1808480	so he's still trying to impress people?
1808480	1811480	Like, that's pretty good, right?
1811480	1813480	I mean, I can't do the head right,
1813480	1815480	but better than you can do.
1815480	1816480	All right.
1816480	1818480	So how was South by Southwest for you?
1818480	1820480	Oh, I had an awesome time.
1820480	1822480	Well, your head was everywhere.
1822480	1825480	Uh, yeah, they really pushed that show.
1825480	1827480	What is it like to be in an airport
1827480	1829480	with the huge defenses?
1829480	1831480	And at the exact moment
1831480	1836480	when I feel the angriest at the government,
1836480	1840480	when I feel the most put down by mainstream society,
1840480	1845480	if my head was above the metal detectors,
1845480	1848480	like, I don't know, I would explode.
1848480	1850480	You're right. It's Orwellian.
1850480	1852480	It kind of feels like, well, it was these guys' idea
1852480	1853480	to get angry at them.
1853480	1855480	It really does feel like that.
1855480	1857480	Did it make you feel like taking your shoes off was...
1857480	1859480	Did it mitigate?
1859480	1861480	Or did it make you feel like...
1861480	1863480	I know I had a moment where I was...
1863480	1865480	I felt I was in the wrong line.
1865480	1867480	Like, I got into the pre-screening line
1867480	1870480	and I wasn't pre-screened, and I had this whole thing.
1870480	1872480	Because you'd want to be normal.
1872480	1875480	Where's my ID? It's right behind you, asshole.
1875480	1877480	You motherfucker. Have you heard of Mike Judge?
1877480	1881480	Okay, well, you should really look into his stuff.
1882480	1885480	So, I was telling you, there were also on cabs and stuff,
1885480	1888480	those pictures, and we were all so excited,
1888480	1890480	all five of us, and we were walking down the street,
1890480	1891480	and this cab was parked there.
1891480	1893480	So it's me, Martin Starr, TJ Miller,
1893480	1895480	Zac Woods, and Thomas Middleditch,
1895480	1897480	and all our faces were on this cab.
1897480	1899480	This guy was parked there, and we were all walking by,
1899480	1902480	and we were like, hey, can we get a picture in front of this guy?
1902480	1904480	I was like, we're going to make this guy's day.
1904480	1906480	Watch this.
1906480	1908480	You have a horrible life driving a cab.
1908480	1910480	Here's a little bit of goodness for you.
1911480	1913480	So we walked up all arrogant, and we were like,
1913480	1915480	hey, can we take a picture in front of this cab?
1915480	1917480	Here's five dollars, and he said, no.
1917480	1919480	I drove off.
1919480	1924480	He left his parking spot to, like, not take a picture with us.
1924480	1926480	Because he wasn't a fan?
1926480	1928480	I don't know what the deal was.
1928480	1930480	The other thing is, they're also in New York,
1930480	1933480	and of course, this is the month where my parents are in Pakistan,
1933480	1937480	so I'm still going to hear, like, hey, you should really go to med school,
1937480	1940480	like, for the rest of my life.
1940480	1944480	I mean, you detect a lace of, the whole time you're in Austin,
1944480	1947480	every time we've been in Austin, for whatever festival we've been there,
1947480	1949480	it's a city of festivals.
1949480	1955480	That place is the eternal, Austin is the guy in your circle of friends
1955480	1958480	whose apartment is just wide open, and everyone just hangs out there,
1958480	1960480	and some people have been crashing there for three days,
1960480	1962480	and he's not that excited about it.
1962480	1964480	Yeah, and don't go to the other apartment around,
1964480	1968480	because that's fucking Texas.
1968480	1971480	This is the cool apartment.
1971480	1974480	And you get to, you know, you're marveling at Austin,
1974480	1978480	and it's gorgeous there, and it's everything.
1978480	1983480	It feels like a city that's just designed to kind of host you.
1983480	1986480	And then, you know, through the miracle of Twitter and stuff,
1986480	1990480	I'm able to see Austin locals going, like, you know,
1990480	1993480	it's all right that you're here, but goddamn this fucking thing.
1993480	1997480	Yeah, I would be so angry, because it really does turn over the city.
1997480	1999480	It was my first time there during the festival.
1999480	2001480	I've been to Austin a dozen or more times,
2001480	2003480	and it's a bummer to be there, because you're like,
2003480	2007480	my thing is I just want to be able to get to a place I want to go eat at
2007480	2010480	or see a show, and you can't move around there.
2010480	2011480	It's so prohibitive.
2011480	2014480	Yeah, the amount that I get pissed at the LA marathon,
2014480	2020480	and please God forgive me, the Armenian genocide parade.
2020480	2022480	Is that a real parade that happens?
2022480	2024480	Well, I mean, they block traffic a little bit,
2024480	2026480	and then I get all huffed up, you know.
2026480	2030480	Like, this is the worst thing that's ever happened.
2030480	2032480	What are you guys about again?
2032480	2035480	Why can't I cross Hollywood? I have rights.
2035480	2038480	You people should be able to relate to this.
2038480	2042480	God, think about it. Make the equation, for God's sake.
2042480	2044480	Get out of my way.
2044480	2046480	That's what I'm saying.
2046480	2050480	LA has a couple of things that disrupt it,
2050480	2053480	but San Francisco and Austin, holy jamoly.
2053480	2056480	The thing that I want to be able to do,
2056480	2060480	like I wish I could, because we're in bad economic times,
2060480	2066480	so for all we know, Austin is like, they shouldn't be failing that way.
2066480	2069480	They should be thinking, holy shit, we would be Detroit
2069480	2076480	if we didn't have 800 strangers per square inch flooding our city every week.
2076480	2079480	But I don't know, and they don't know, and no one can know.
2079480	2081480	You'd have to create a parallel universe
2081480	2084480	where they didn't create that kind of...
2084480	2087480	It's a wonderful life with Austin.
2087480	2091480	With Austin as the protagonist standing on a bridge about to jump.
2091480	2094480	I can't stand being the host of all these festivals anymore.
2094480	2096480	But wait!
2096480	2098480	I never saw the movie.
2098480	2100480	Have you not seen it?
2100480	2102480	I mean, you got it. That's the movie.
2102480	2104480	Yeah, I know. Well, there's these movies,
2104480	2106480	like Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind.
2106480	2108480	You never saw Wizard of Oz?
2108480	2110480	I don't think I've seen it all the way through.
2111480	2112480	So you don't...
2112480	2115480	But I have a piecemeal through every...
2115480	2118480	I could tell you from... Okay, starts in black and white.
2118480	2120480	She works on a farm.
2120480	2124480	She's bummed out because it's in black and white.
2124480	2129480	She meets every character that you're going to see as an animal.
2129480	2131480	And then a tornado comes.
2131480	2134480	She sings a song, and a tornado comes.
2134480	2138480	She sings a tornado song, and the tornado makes everything go into color.
2138480	2140480	Do you remember how the tornado song goes?
2140480	2143480	Somewhere over the tornado.
2143480	2145480	Is that the song?
2145480	2148480	She sings a tornado song, and then she lands.
2148480	2150480	She lands on a witch.
2150480	2153480	Now she's committed a crime before she even knows she does.
2153480	2155480	These little people come up and they say,
2155480	2156480	like, you killed the witch.
2156480	2158480	And then another witch says, follow...
2158480	2160480	There's no problem.
2160480	2162480	I know how you can get out of here.
2162480	2164480	Follow the yellow brick road.
2164480	2167480	She meets, not necessarily in this order, a scarecrow.
2167480	2173480	A scarecrow, an iron man, and a lion.
2173480	2175480	A lion.
2175480	2179480	That would be great if it was the iron man.
2179480	2181480	And she meets them all.
2181480	2184480	They get attacked in no necessary order by trees, monkeys, and poppies.
2184480	2187480	And then they go to the Emerald City.
2187480	2189480	That's the meeting with the goddess, and they get there.
2189480	2191480	And then they atone with the father,
2191480	2195480	which is the fact that the Wizard of Oz is just a shithead behind a curtain.
2195480	2197480	She finds that out.
2197480	2200480	Somewhere along the line, they make the witch melt with water.
2200480	2203480	I don't know if she comes into the Emerald City and is like,
2203480	2204480	stop it!
2204480	2206480	That part doesn't make any sense to me.
2206480	2209480	But then, in one of the most egregious violations
2209480	2211480	of my personal cinematic narrative rules,
2211480	2214480	she finds out she could have gone home any time!
2214480	2216480	By clicking her heels.
2216480	2218480	And so she does.
2218480	2221480	Does she wake up in black and white again?
2221480	2222480	Yes.
2222480	2224480	That's kind of a rip-off.
2224480	2230480	Do you remember what the Iron Man and the Lion and Scarecrow were searching for?
2230480	2232480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2232480	2235480	The Cowardly Lion wants a heart.
2235480	2237480	So he has a song about wanting a heart.
2237480	2240480	No, Iron Man wants a heart.
2240480	2242480	He has an arc reactor.
2242480	2244480	He wants a heart.
2248480	2250480	Thank you very much.
2250480	2251480	You're right.
2251480	2253480	Okay, so the Tin Man wants a heart.
2253480	2254480	Tin Man, yes.
2254480	2255480	He doesn't have a heart.
2255480	2257480	I associate the heart with courage.
2257480	2258480	What the fuck does the lion want?
2258480	2259480	He has a diploma.
2259480	2261480	I just want claws!
2261480	2263480	He literally gets a diploma at the end.
2263480	2264480	Right?
2264480	2265480	It's just courage.
2265480	2266480	Or he gets a badge.
2266480	2268480	Who gets the diploma?
2268480	2269480	Scarecrow.
2269480	2270480	Scarecrow.
2270480	2271480	Sloppy.
2273480	2277480	So like heart is courage is bravery is passion.
2277480	2278480	So lump it together.
2278480	2279480	Make one character out of three.
2279480	2281480	Represent those.
2281480	2282480	Sorry.
2283480	2286480	Are you fixing a movie you haven't seen?
2288480	2289480	There's a reason I won't watch it.
2289480	2291480	It looks sloppy from a distance.
2291480	2294480	That should be a fucking segment every episode.
2294480	2296480	Dad fixes a movie he hasn't seen.
2297480	2300480	We'll go down to AFI 100.
2301480	2302480	Exactly.
2302480	2306480	What's the major film that you haven't seen that you're like,
2306480	2310480	that you're embarrassed or that you're unrepentant about not having seen?
2311480	2313480	Well, I mean, Wizard of Oz is a big one.
2313480	2315480	So it's a wonderful life.
2315480	2316480	Yeah.
2316480	2318480	It's so forced on you.
2318480	2322480	It took me until my mid-20s to start watching Woody Allen movies.
2322480	2325480	Because when I was growing up, it was like every standup would come out and go,
2325480	2327480	Woody Allen.
2327480	2332480	And I didn't understand that he was an artist and that he was writing things.
2332480	2333480	Yeah.
2333480	2336480	I also didn't understand that he was a guy that was like,
2336480	2338480	he was a nerd that was putting himself in movies.
2338480	2342480	I just thought that God made action figures that were famous
2342480	2345480	and that this guy I was supposed to think was interesting
2345480	2347480	because he had glasses and red hair.
2349480	2351480	And then you have to shake that stuff.
2351480	2355480	And those holiday movies, they're hard to swallow.
2355480	2356480	It's a wonderful life.
2356480	2360480	You have to really cut yourself off from the weight of it,
2360480	2362480	of how everyone talks about it.
2362480	2364480	But it's a good, I like that movie.
2364480	2365480	It's a very small thing.
2365480	2366480	It's a very small thing.
2366480	2368480	But this was before, you know.
2368480	2370480	I've seen big parts of it, I think.
2370480	2372480	I mean, I know that, yeah,
2372480	2374480	the angel gets his wings when you ring the bell
2374480	2378480	and the Mr. Banks doesn't want the money in the potter in the wheelchair.
2380480	2382480	He finds out that if he wasn't around,
2382480	2385480	it's a potter needs a heart and...
2386480	2389480	It sounds like a second act is a...
2389480	2391480	It sounds like a kind of...
2391480	2393480	Like kind of long.
2394480	2396480	I love this segment.
2396480	2398480	How do you know how long the second act sounds?
2398480	2400480	It sounds like it's kind of long.
2400480	2402480	Because I've never heard,
2402480	2405480	like throughout 41 years of living in a world
2405480	2407480	that keeps referencing that movie,
2407480	2413480	I've never heard anyone reference any structural flagstones
2413480	2416480	that make a complete story.
2416480	2419480	It sounds like this guy's going to kill himself
2419480	2421480	and then an angel comes up and says,
2421480	2424480	don't kill yourself, why shouldn't I?
2425480	2427480	I'll tell you why.
2427480	2430480	Because if you did, things would be worse.
2430480	2432480	And he's like, I don't believe you.
2432480	2435480	Which is just like one-third the Christmas carol,
2435480	2437480	you know, or a Christmas carol.
2437480	2439480	And he takes him and he goes and shows him.
2439480	2441480	He goes like, look at this.
2441480	2444480	And he's like, oh my God, I can't believe I'm dead.
2444480	2445480	And people noticed.
2445480	2448480	Except when we watch it now, Potterville is fucking awesome.
2449480	2450480	The Potterville is like,
2450480	2452480	everyone's just like jitterbugging
2452480	2454480	and there's good music and I could see it.
2454480	2456480	It's like, you'd rather hang out with Potterville.
2456480	2458480	You did ruin everything.
2458480	2461480	But I like the part, and it's been a long time since I've seen it.
2461480	2462480	I don't know the movie very well.
2462480	2465480	I've only seen it a couple of times over a long amount of years.
2465480	2467480	People are gasping, by the way.
2467480	2470480	His house is all windy and the house that he bought,
2470480	2472480	that he got with his wife and they had a family
2472480	2474480	and the house is shitty and it's drafty
2474480	2477480	and it's falling apart and he's going broke.
2477480	2478480	There's a run on the bank.
2478480	2480480	And a little, what do you call it, a little ball,
2480480	2482480	a little knoll thing or knobs thing that comes off
2482480	2484480	at the end of the stairwell.
2484480	2486480	And he starts yelling and his daughter is sick.
2486480	2488480	When does he take a knob off the stairwell?
2488480	2490480	It just comes off.
2490480	2492480	It comes off when they first move in the house and it's charming.
2492480	2493480	It's the straw.
2493480	2494480	The house is a fixer-upper.
2494480	2497480	Like this is the symbol that we have growing to do.
2497480	2499480	Then it never changes.
2499480	2501480	The house just keeps being shitty and it's getting shittier.
2501480	2504480	Now his daughter on Christmas Eve or whatever has a cough
2504480	2506480	and she's sick because it's so fucking cold in the house.
2506480	2507480	Oh Jesus.
2507480	2514480	And so while the angel has proven to him how bad life would be,
2514480	2516480	he's just getting angry at his family.
2516480	2518480	I forget if he goes back at this point, I don't know,
2518480	2520480	but at one point he starts yelling at his family
2520480	2523480	and he becomes like, I didn't fucking ask for this shit.
2523480	2524480	I don't fucking want to do this.
2524480	2525480	I never wanted this.
2525480	2527480	I always wanted something else.
2527480	2529480	You guys made me do this shit.
2529480	2531480	Like fuck you, fuck me, fuck everybody.
2531480	2534480	And it's the symbol of that piece of furniture breaking
2534480	2537480	and he raises his voice at his little sick daughter,
2537480	2539480	Zazu or whatever her name is.
2539480	2540480	Zazu, was it?
2540480	2541480	Zuzu.
2541480	2542480	Zuzu.
2542480	2544480	And like that moment, it's like shit gets really dark
2544480	2547480	and he just implodes and that's when it starts to become not fake Capra.
2547480	2549480	It becomes really punk rock and dark.
2549480	2553480	And then Capra puts this beautiful little bow on it at the end,
2553480	2555480	which is like, it's good stuff.
2555480	2557480	Also, it's an America that never existed.
2557480	2559480	You know, it's a fake America.
2559480	2562480	Wasn't there something about a pharmacist that hit a kid so much
2562480	2563480	he was deaf or something?
2563480	2564480	They hit him.
2564480	2566480	He can't hear the one ear because he clipped him.
2566480	2570480	He tried to save him from putting, like he was senile or drunk or whatever
2570480	2572480	and he was going to poison an old lady.
2572480	2574480	And so he smashes him over the ear and he can't hear.
2574480	2576480	He has a bad ear because of that.
2576480	2578480	Isn't there also a part where they like propose
2578480	2581480	and there's like a fake moon out the window that they put up?
2581480	2582480	Do you remember that?
2582480	2583480	Is that right?
2583480	2584480	Right?
2584480	2585480	I remember.
2585480	2586480	Do you want the moon, Mary?
2586480	2590480	So you guys, as experts in this movie,
2591480	2593480	we've all experienced the same amount of cinema.
2593480	2594480	That's my point.
2598480	2600480	That movie moved me and touched me.
2600480	2601480	Prove it.
2603480	2604480	Prove it with a rap.
2605480	2606480	All right, no.
2607480	2609480	By the way, speaking of, can I say, I told you this.
2610480	2617480	That Dean Pelton rap is one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my entire life.
2617480	2620480	I watched it, I swear, at least 30 times.
2620480	2622480	It's so funny.
2622480	2623480	It's so good.
2624480	2626480	The fourth time I watched it, I didn't even laugh.
2626480	2628480	I just didn't breathe for a while.
2628480	2630480	It's so great.
2630480	2631480	Yeah.
2631480	2636480	Somebody online, tempoed it and put it under a beat
2636480	2637480	and it's amazing.
2637480	2638480	Aaron played it for me.
2639480	2647480	Don Diego and I wrote the lyrics overnight, one night.
2647480	2648480	Don Diego?
2648480	2650480	You have a Spanish gentleman working for you?
2650480	2655480	Is that just like your imaginary friend who does rewrites with you?
2655480	2656480	Hello, Dan.
2656480	2657480	I'm not alone.
2657480	2658480	Don Diego is here.
2658480	2660480	Don Diego does sound like...
2660480	2662480	Were you asleep at your writing office at night
2662480	2664480	and a figure emerged in the balcony?
2665480	2667480	He definitely, we always tease him about that.
2667480	2670480	Yeah, it's just Dan with a rose in his ear.
2674480	2677480	But he kind of spat out a bunch of stuff
2677480	2680480	and the original thing that he threw out,
2680480	2684480	that it included the whole ending, which is that I didn't want to change.
2684480	2687480	It's just like Barack Obama is scared of me.
2689480	2692480	Barack Obama is scared of me.
2692480	2694480	But then we sat and it kind of nit-picked.
2694480	2696480	And then when I heard it set to the beat, it was like,
2696480	2698480	oh, that's a good rap.
2700480	2702480	Yeah, it's a funny joke. It's great.
2702480	2704480	I love it as much as everybody.
2704480	2706480	I just love how quickly it goes south.
2706480	2709480	He gets two lines out and then it's like, what the fuck is going on?
2709480	2711480	Because he wants to do a freestyle rap.
2711480	2714480	I love that character so much because he's like a children's book character.
2716480	2719480	To me, that's like the other high point of him is when he comes in
2719480	2722480	and he's a half man, half woman because he wants to say that.
2722480	2726480	And then he has this breakdown and goes, what am I doing?
2726480	2729480	And it's like, I've got to fucking cool it and he runs out
2729480	2732480	and then he comes back at the end of the episode and goes, you know what?
2732480	2735480	I thought about it and I had lunch with people who were interested
2735480	2738480	in what makes me tick and I had the best day of my life.
2738480	2740480	He's like the pokey little puppy.
2742480	2746480	He's so simultaneously, he represents...
2746480	2754480	We equate complexity with the opposite of innocence too much.
2756480	2761480	We think that innocence means purity and it doesn't.
2761480	2767480	You could be the most complicated, most sexual,
2767480	2772480	most labyrinthine person in the world and you could still be innocent.
2773480	2777480	You don't have to be a cotton ball that just has no substance to it.
2777480	2780480	You think like, oh, that's that stuff, that won't hurt you.
2780480	2781480	That's what innocence means.
2781480	2786480	No, innocence means there's nothing that could hurt you here.
2786480	2788480	This person wouldn't hurt you.
2788480	2794480	He has a river that runs, leaks deep underneath him, but he's innocent.
2794480	2797480	And so he stumbles into these situations and he's like,
2797480	2799480	I'm going to do a freestyle rap because you're late.
2800480	2805480	I can't pay you this week, so I'm going to do this freestyle rap
2805480	2807480	where you don't know what you're going to say next.
2807480	2812480	And he starts rapping and he stumbles into the spirit of the street overtakes him
2812480	2819480	and he becomes a vessel for black anger and disenfranchised youth
2819480	2823480	and has to run out of the room dressed as a peanut black.
2824480	2828480	It really is the best show ever on TV.
2833480	2835480	Well, at least that moment anyway.
2835480	2839480	So, yeah, no, we all feel the same way in the writers room.
2839480	2841480	We like that.
2841480	2844480	And Jim Raj needs whatever.
2844480	2850480	He, I mean, like 50 takes of that because I kept being like,
2850480	2854480	well, yeah, but the camera needs to be on you enough time that...
2854480	2857480	Is he doing that rap even when it's not as coverage?
2857480	2859480	Was he giving it as long?
2859480	2864480	Yeah, he is, but also the point of the rap is that it escalates and escalates
2864480	2866480	and escalates until he's screaming.
2866480	2870480	And so he's doing different takes from different angles and I just kept...
2870480	2875480	There are two moments when I've almost killed a man on that set.
2875480	2879480	That's one and the other one is when Leonard, Richard Urban,
2879480	2885480	the guy who plays Leonard, that his first episode in season one,
2885480	2888480	he was in a pool and he's treading water.
2888480	2893480	You go through central casting and you order people like so much,
2893480	2897480	like off a menu, you go, I need an old guy that can swim.
2897480	2902480	And you get Richard Erdman who was in Gunsmoke and had his own show
2902480	2906480	and was on Sid Caesar and you go to his IMDB page.
2906480	2912480	So sometime after I didn't realize I've been physically abusing television history.
2912480	2917480	But in the meantime, I got an old guy that can swim and he's swimming.
2917480	2922480	He's just supposed to be treading water in a pool and Jeff Winger said something
2922480	2927480	and then he goes, well, he's just busted, but what was it?
2927480	2930480	Jeff goes, we're all crazy, not me.
2930480	2933480	And then Jeff says, shut up, shut up, Leonard.
2933480	2935480	And this random character, shut up, Leonard.
2935480	2937480	I saw your art project, whatever.
2937480	2939480	And I was like, busted.
2939480	2941480	And then he switched away.
2941480	2945480	We're shooting coverage of Leonard and he's just an old guy that can swim
2945480	2947480	and we're just making him swim forever.
2947480	2950480	And I'm just like, he's not saying busted right.
2950480	2952480	It's just like another take, another take.
2952480	2956480	And I went to the bathroom early on before I came back
2956480	2961480	and we did like 50 more takes and then eventually Joe Russo, the director,
2961480	2964480	said like, he's going to drown.
2964480	2968480	And I think he got it while you were in the bathroom, like on take one.
2968480	2972480	And I think that you've been drowning an old man.
2972480	2973480	For no reason.
2973480	2974480	For no reason the entire time.
2974480	2979480	I think you're like an Egyptian pharaoh in a Mel Gibson movie
2979480	2982480	about just the end of civilization.
2982480	2986480	But you know, once he drowns, nobody fucks up a take after that.
2986480	2989480	I look at the rest of the pool and I go, you see that?
2989480	2990480	Say busted right.
2990480	2992480	You see what craft gets you?
2995480	2997480	You follow direction.
2997480	3001480	And so it turned out absolutely he nailed it on the first take.
3001480	3004480	And the rest of the 50 takes, he was just inhaling too much water
3004480	3006480	to get his line right.
3006480	3010480	Because he's an old man who can swim.
3010480	3014480	So yeah, that's how I met Leonard is almost killing him.
3014480	3017480	And that's the second time I saw him because we brought him back
3017480	3022480	and I was like, this time you're bungee jumping for this thing.
3022480	3025480	They're supposed to just walk by him and he's supposed to go,
3025480	3028480	like Professor Slater says a zinger to Jeff
3028480	3032480	and then they're supposed to just land on Leonard going, ooh.
3032480	3036480	And he's just there and they keep going past him and he keeps going,
3036480	3039480	oh, oh, oh, oh.
3039480	3042480	Or, oh, oh, yeah.
3042480	3043480	Everything but who.
3043480	3046480	And I go up to him and he doesn't know who I am.
3046480	3051480	And he says, I just go, hey, Richard, hey, could this next take?
3051480	3054480	Just go like, who?
3054480	3057480	And he goes, pfft.
3057480	3060480	He just looked at me and just like, fuck you.
3060480	3063480	You know, I got from all of that, like, fuck you.
3063480	3066480	I didn't know at the time still that he was.
3066480	3068480	I said Caesar and all of that.
3068480	3070480	I just, what I got was fuck you.
3070480	3071480	And I was like, Jesus Christ.
3071480	3073480	Did he know that you were the guy that nearly drowned him the time before?
3073480	3076480	I think he might have known that but not that I created the show.
3076480	3079480	I think he was the guy who murders me.
3079480	3082480	That's the worst fraction of information to know about.
3082480	3086480	I know that face from one place, which is my death.
3086480	3087480	I don't know.
3087480	3090480	But then, you know, anyways, who cares?
3090480	3091480	Great scene.
3091480	3093480	Yeah, peanut bar rap.
3093480	3094480	Thanks.
3094480	3097480	This is the place where you laugh at the peanut bar rap.
3097480	3099480	Watch Community on Thursdays on NBC,
3099480	3105480	then tune in to Dan Harmon's podcast to laugh at the peanut bar rap.
3105480	3108480	Behind the scenes of the peanut bar rap.
3108480	3109480	All right.
3109480	3115480	So I think that I didn't talk to him about it.
3115480	3122480	I got out of my car as he dropped me off at my house last time I saw him on Friday.
3122480	3127480	And I said, see you Sunday?
3128480	3130480	And he said, I think he said yes.
3130480	3132480	And I literally haven't talked to him since.
3132480	3134480	Was he in the green room?
3134480	3135480	He's here.
3135480	3136480	Who is he?
3136480	3137480	I have no idea who you're talking about.
3137480	3138480	Is Spencer back?
3138480	3140480	Yeah, he's here.
3140480	3141480	Spencer!
3141480	3143480	Spencer!
3149480	3152480	Yeah!
3152480	3155480	Oh, shit!
3156480	3157480	Oh, shit!
3157480	3162480	I guess it was just air.
3165480	3167480	That's a new cat friend.
3167480	3170480	I hope that was ironic enough.
3170480	3175480	I wasn't even thinking about the fact that since we last saw you, you were on Community.
3180480	3181480	Yeah, yeah, it was.
3181480	3184480	I asked you this already, but I haven't seen you in a couple of days.
3184480	3186480	Has there been any negative...
3186480	3189480	This is what I keep bracing myself for.
3189480	3193480	I don't want you to be abraded and flapped.
3193480	3194480	You're unflappable.
3194480	3196480	I don't want you to be flapped by being on the show.
3196480	3198480	Yeah.
3198480	3204480	In the East Coast viewing, there was some people talking shit about me.
3204480	3208480	But it was cool because they were right.
3209480	3210480	No, they weren't.
3210480	3212480	They just had shitty weather.
3212480	3213480	They did.
3213480	3214480	No, they were lame.
3214480	3215480	They were being lame.
3215480	3216480	What was their beef?
3216480	3217480	I don't know.
3217480	3219480	They called me Beardy McGee.
3219480	3224480	That's accurate and flattering.
3224480	3225480	I don't know.
3225480	3226480	I wouldn't say so.
3226480	3230480	You don't like the Irish connotation in that or what?
3230480	3231480	He is wearing green.
3231480	3234480	Yeah, I'm very strongly anti-Irish.
3234480	3236480	I don't know.
3236480	3237480	My voice sounds weird.
3237480	3240480	You're so anti-Irish, you're wearing green the night before St. Patrick's Day.
3240480	3243480	Yeah, because that's why I'm anti-Irish.
3243480	3247480	Because I was always attacked in school for not fucking wearing green
3247480	3252480	because apparently it's okay to touch other people without their permission.
3252480	3254480	You get pinched or punched?
3254480	3255480	Yeah, just constantly.
3255480	3259480	And half the time I'd be wearing green and it's like, where do you get off?
3259480	3264480	Apparently I'm touching other people without their permission.
3264480	3268480	Maybe that was their way of getting a little piece of you kind of surreptitiously.
3268480	3269480	I want to touch him.
3269480	3271480	This is the only angle I have.
3271480	3275480	I bet there were like 50 people last week being like, oh, I pinched that guy.
3275480	3276480	They probably were.
3276480	3277480	Yeah, no, I was actually...
3277480	3280480	There's a tradition about getting pinched if you don't wear green.
3280480	3281480	Yeah, if you don't wear green.
3281480	3282480	Green on St. Patrick's Day.
3282480	3283480	Were you not constantly...
3283480	3285480	Oh my God, I'm so envious.
3285480	3288480	I was seriously just tortured in school.
3288480	3289480	It's horrible.
3289480	3292480	My angle was always I have green eyes and if that didn't work, I said,
3292480	3295480	I wear green underwear and I play on their homophobia.
3295480	3298480	I would wear green underwear like half the time.
3298480	3299480	Not on purpose.
3299480	3301480	They just always had green underwear.
3301480	3304480	It's white when you put it on.
3304480	3308480	You should go to the doctor.
3308480	3314480	We should just hang out.
3314480	3319480	Spencer, are you excited about all the stuff from the episode?
3319480	3321480	Yeah, so there's too much to talk to you about.
3321480	3324480	You were in this TV show, who cares?
3324480	3326480	Somebody call you Beardy McGee.
3326480	3327480	It's true.
3327480	3328480	Then we went to Austin.
3328480	3334480	We premiered this movie that if it's not accurate to call you the star of the movie,
3334480	3339480	it's certainly accurate to call you the hero of the movie.
3339480	3341480	Would anything change from that?
3341480	3344480	Any dents in your Spencer-ness?
3344480	3345480	No, I don't know.
3345480	3347480	It was weird seeing that movie.
3347480	3349480	I had such a short beard back then.
3350480	3353480	No one called you Beardy McGee.
3353480	3355480	No, no, certainly not.
3355480	3357480	Beardy or Rourke at least.
3357480	3358480	Just a Rourke.
3358480	3361480	No, it was really good seeing me on the movie.
3361480	3366480	I was a lot more comfortable seeing myself in the movie than on TV.
3366480	3367480	I don't know.
3367480	3370480	Seeing myself on TV, I was like, no, this is wrong.
3370480	3372480	Everything about this is terrible.
3372480	3375480	Was it that you were playing someone else rather than being yourself?
3375480	3377480	Probably had something to do with it.
3377480	3378480	Yeah, that makes sense.
3378480	3380480	It's just weird, you guys.
3380480	3382480	None of us belong on TV.
3382480	3384480	TV is a crazy place for crazy people.
3384480	3388480	Those people are crazy.
3388480	3391480	But I wrote a character for you that's like, oh, this guy's crazy.
3391480	3395480	He should feel out of place, should feel fine so that you were protected.
3395480	3398480	Yeah, I felt protected by that role definitely.
3398480	3403480	But the movie on the heels of the movie, I don't know, nothing's really changed.
3403480	3407480	For me, everything's changed because I don't know how much of this you knew,
3407480	3413480	but I, for the entire time that movie, there was a certain point where I was just living in grief.
3413480	3419480	I was just multitasking a specific amount of my brain and my stomach for fucking grief
3419480	3425480	because I was seeing cuts of the movie and I was like, my life goes up and down.
3425480	3428480	I make a rape joke.
3428480	3429480	I don't make a rape joke.
3429480	3430480	I make a Rick and Morty.
3430480	3431480	I don't make a Rick and Morty.
3431480	3436480	I'm constantly obsessed with how people think about me,
3436480	3438480	but I don't want to ever be dishonest.
3438480	3440480	I'm a narcissist, but I'm honest about that.
3440480	3442480	Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
3442480	3444480	I made this movie.
3444480	3451480	I'm in it and I'm watching cuts of it and I'm like, there were dark, dark, dark days.
3451480	3455480	And I don't know how much of that you were experiencing if you were ever wondering,
3455480	3457480	what the fuck is this cloud?
3457480	3459480	Is this ever going to come over?
3459480	3463480	Were you ever wondering, how am I going to be portrayed in this movie?
3463480	3465480	Because you never saw anything of it.
3465480	3467480	I just tried not to think about it.
3467480	3472480	I mean, it wasn't about me like it was about you and who you are.
3472480	3479480	So I wasn't worried that I'd be a weird part of it or some part of it that I wouldn't expect.
3479480	3482480	I thought that what I was in was pretty, pretty good.
3482480	3486480	And I came off as a really good guy, but I didn't expect to be in it.
3486480	3489480	I probably didn't even expect to be in it as much as I was.
3489480	3490480	So I wasn't really worried about it.
3490480	3492480	It had to be about you at a certain point.
3492480	3497480	It was Erin's idea really to, I remember at the pit of my despair going,
3497480	3499480	I'm going to fucking kill myself.
3499480	3504480	Like this movie is the nail in my self-destructive coffin.
3504480	3508480	I finally figured out a way to make everyone hate me because I don't change.
3508480	3511480	There's nothing redeemable about me, et cetera, et cetera.
3511480	3516480	And I was venting all this to Erin and Erin said, just tell Neil,
3516480	3519480	because I don't have any control over the editorial content,
3519480	3524480	but she was like, just tell Neil who's struggling for a story in this movie,
3524480	3526480	just tell him to make it about Spencer.
3526480	3530480	Tell him that the story is Spencer and leave you alone.
3530480	3535480	Like let you be the asshole that you are or the non-asshole that you are.
3535480	3541480	Let you just be Dan Harmon in the background as the bedrock of the whole thing
3541480	3545480	and let anybody that goes through anything be the young guy that everybody likes
3545480	3547480	that is undeniably going on a little journey.
3548480	3552480	To me, that was the turning point of this thing not making me almost kill myself
3552480	3556480	because I did call Neil and give him Erin's note.
3556480	3560480	And the next cut I saw was like, holy shit, this is going to work.
3560480	3562480	I'm going to get away with this.
3562480	3567480	And so we premiered it at South by Southwest and people like it
3567480	3570480	and the reviews are good and stuff.
3570480	3573480	Yeah, I wish I'd seen it. I read the reviews. They're really good.
3573480	3576480	I didn't want to read too much because I don't really have a sense of what the movie is like.
3576480	3578480	Do you guys like how it turned out?
3578480	3579480	Yeah.
3579480	3581480	It's almost like the equivalent. It's just weird.
3581480	3586480	It's like you go into a dark bar and it's not...
3586480	3591480	I don't know what the fuck it is. It's got details.
3591480	3596480	I don't know if there are all the details that everybody wants or needs at any given time.
3596480	3600480	For me, Spencer is kind of the emergent hero in it.
3600480	3608480	For me, the movie is ostensibly about Dan and the eternal question, why are we doing this?
3608480	3611480	Why are we going out on tour? Why are we making this movie?
3611480	3614480	The guy gets fired from his show so he goes on the road.
3614480	3617480	They kept asking me in interviews, why are we doing this?
3617480	3620480	I don't know what we're doing. I just think it's going to be fun.
3620480	3623480	And then Spencer kind of goes through an actual journey.
3623480	3625480	But for me, the movie is about you guys.
3625480	3627480	It's about the fans that come to the show
3627480	3630480	because everybody is an individual.
3630480	3634480	But it comes together as this kind of awesome organism of people.
3634480	3638480	And there's this straight to camera interviews with the Armenians.
3638480	3642480	And I've seen three cuts of it and I cry every time.
3642480	3648480	It's not like boo-hoo, but it's just like some really beautiful kind of human moments in there.
3648480	3653480	I think it's more about the people that come than about anybody up on the stage.
3653480	3655480	Yeah, they call that the money shot.
3655480	3663480	No, I was doing a pun joke.
3663480	3672480	The capillaries in your cheeks dilate when fans are looking into the camera.
3672480	3679480	Let's get Aaron McGathey out here. It was awesome.
3685480	3691480	Hello.
3691480	3693480	Did you like the movie, Aaron?
3693480	3697480	I did like the movie. I'm going to steal a line from a review.
3697480	3700480	It's a movie about finding your people.
3700480	3703480	And so I think for that reason, it's great.
3703480	3705480	It does what it sets out to do.
3705480	3709480	It does. I look like a real bummer in it, but it's great.
3709480	3711480	But that's not really true.
3712480	3720480	You just don't look like the genius and muse and person that's funnier than me
3720480	3724480	and person that the documentary should be about, which is the truth.
3724480	3727480	Well, thank you for your flattery.
3727480	3732480	When you focus the camera on me, my girlfriend becomes a person pushing a shopping cart.
3732480	3736480	And at various points, I take a shit on her to be funny.
3736480	3739480	So it's not an accurate portrayal of our relationship,
3739480	3742480	but it is an accurate portrayal of what an asshole boyfriend I am.
3742480	3744480	I'm going to take what you're saying all the way to the bank
3744480	3752480	and tell you guys that they cut out me figuring out almost the way to cure cancer.
3752480	3753480	Almost?
3753480	3754480	Almost.
3754480	3757480	At one point, there were all these people in a soup line,
3757480	3761480	and I stood in front of them, and I started delivering this comedic speech,
3761480	3764480	and they all suddenly were full.
3764480	3766480	They went and got jobs.
3766480	3768480	There's hundreds and hundreds of hours.
3768480	3770480	I mean, it's 600 hours of footage.
3770480	3775480	I saw cuts where all of a sudden you're just following Jeff around the city,
3775480	3778480	and he's alone, and he suddenly explains why he always,
3778480	3783480	every time the bus stops, breaks off and goes to be by himself and reads a book.
3783480	3787480	And then he starts talking about his mother, and that's all gone.
3787480	3789480	Jeff's just a guy in a suit in the movie.
3789480	3791480	Jeff, I wanted to tell you this last week.
3791480	3794480	I took a trip by myself to Palm Springs,
3794480	3798480	and I really was trying to channel you when I was walking out in the city.
3798480	3802480	I took with me a book, and I went to a Mexican restaurant,
3802480	3804480	and I'm just like, Jeff, David's just going to read this book.
3804480	3808480	I got salsa all over my book.
3808480	3809480	That doesn't surprise me a bit.
3809480	3811480	I've seen you around salsa.
3811480	3814480	We were in San Francisco a couple years ago.
3814480	3818480	I've seen you around salsa as a great name for this episode.
3818480	3822480	We called Aaron the Salsa Monster because there was a salsa bar
3822480	3824480	in the mission at this burrito place.
3824480	3825480	We were all dead.
3825480	3827480	We were just drinking all day long.
3827480	3829480	It was the last day of our trip.
3829480	3832480	We extended our stay another day, and we all got drunk and high
3832480	3834480	and went to this burrito place.
3834480	3836480	And there was a salsa bar.
3836480	3838480	It was not even those little small plastic ramekins
3838480	3840480	that give you to put salsa.
3840480	3845480	This one had kind of like quarter pound tubs, like big ones,
3845480	3849480	like you get olives in, like a gelson or something like that.
3849480	3851480	You kept going to the bar and getting more salsa.
3851480	3852480	I was upsetting children.
3852480	3854480	That's not an exaggeration.
3854480	3855480	Children that were near the bar.
3855480	3856480	She kept going back, I've got to get more salsa,
3856480	3857480	because she was out of salsa.
3857480	3860480	The reason why you're out of salsa is because none of it was in your mouth
3860480	3861480	or on the food.
3861480	3865480	It was on the floor, in your lap, on my shoe, on the table.
3865480	3870480	It was like, maybe you don't actually like salsa.
3870480	3874480	The end of my Palm Springs Jeff Davis trip was that I got salsa
3874480	3877480	all over my book, and I had had two margaritas,
3877480	3881480	and I went back to my car, and I took a two-hour nap in my car
3881480	3883480	on the street in Palm Springs.
3883480	3884480	That's exactly how I do it.
3884480	3886480	And it was like a vision quest where I was going to find myself,
3886480	3889480	and I found myself drunk in a car.
3889480	3891480	So what were you hoping that would happen,
3891480	3894480	if you successfully channeled me?
3894480	3896480	Yeah, well, that's a good question.
3896480	3900480	What does happen to Jeff in those moments between dimensions?
3900480	3901480	No, emotional armor.
3901480	3905480	Do you go and rejoin the adjustment bureau?
3906480	3909480	Do you have friends between dimensions?
3909480	3910480	Really quick about that.
3910480	3913480	I'm going to go read Moby Dick over a shot of Fernet Bronco
3913480	3914480	down the street.
3914480	3915480	OK, Jeff.
3915480	3916480	Who's that guy?
3916480	3917480	I think he's kidding.
3917480	3921480	Once upon a time, and he goes through a portal,
3921480	3924480	and there's just other guys in suits that are pretending
3924480	3927480	to read Moby Dick.
3927480	3930480	Yeah.
3930480	3931480	Sounds like Wings of Desire.
3931480	3932480	Have you seen that movie?
3932480	3933480	Yeah, exactly.
3933480	3934480	It's a fucking great movie.
3934480	3935480	I love that movie.
3935480	3938480	Dan, what's your feelings about Wings of Desire?
3938480	3940480	I don't even know what that is.
3940480	3943480	It was remade into an American movie starring
3943480	3946480	Nicholas Cage called City of Angels.
3946480	3949480	And it's these angels who sort of go around.
3949480	3950480	Yeah, that's what the movie is.
3950480	3953480	But there's a great scene where there's a guy like,
3953480	3956480	so these angels just sort of go around the city unseen,
3956480	3957480	Berlin, and sort of.
3957480	3959480	And Peter Falk, spoiler?
3959480	3961480	Is it bad to say it with Peter Falk, isn't it?
3961480	3962480	It is a spoiler.
3962480	3963480	Yeah.
3963480	3965480	Peter Falk plays himself, and it's just awesome.
3965480	3966480	Oh, yeah, he plays himself.
3966480	3967480	What's his name?
3967480	3968480	Bruno Gans.
3968480	3970480	The director, the German director.
3970480	3971480	Vin vendors.
3971480	3972480	Vin vendors.
3972480	3974480	It's a beautiful, wonderful movie.
3974480	3975480	It's an amazing movie.
3975480	3977480	Yeah, but my favorite thing on the tour,
3977480	3978480	the director, Neil, kept saying, like,
3978480	3980480	Jeff, we need a shot of you.
3980480	3982480	I want to know what you do when you go away,
3982480	3984480	because we would hit town, and towns that were cool,
3984480	3985480	like New York.
3985480	3987480	Most of the towns we went to are big cities
3987480	3988480	and cool places to go.
3988480	3990480	And I just kind of like to go on my own, grab a book,
3990480	3992480	and just kind of bone out, look on Yelp,
3992480	3994480	and find out, like, a piece of pizza or something like that,
3994480	3995480	or something like that.
3995480	3997480	I just spent a moment, like, alone doing that.
3997480	3999480	And he kept trying to follow me around.
3999480	4001480	I just get these calls from Neil Berkley.
4001480	4002480	He's like, Jeff, where are you right now?
4002480	4004480	I'm in a subway in New York, going to the city,
4004480	4005480	like, from Brooklyn.
4005480	4006480	Can I send cameras?
4006480	4009480	No, because we won't be able to shoot where I want to go.
4009480	4010480	Like, you won't be able to clear cameras
4010480	4012480	at the place I'm going to.
4012480	4014480	So in Chicago, we finally did.
4014480	4016480	He's like, Jeff, we need to find out.
4016480	4017480	I'm just out of curiosity.
4017480	4021480	What do you do when you go off into the night on your own?
4021480	4023480	And so I said, I'm going to go to this place or that place.
4023480	4025480	If you can clear a camera there.
4025480	4027480	What were the places?
4027480	4029480	Butt nuts.
4029480	4030480	Where is he?
4030480	4031480	And the butt nuts?
4031480	4033480	And the manhole.
4033480	4035480	I used to live by the manhole.
4035480	4036480	Did you really?
4036480	4037480	Yeah.
4037480	4040480	That's my second favorite name of a gay bar.
4040480	4042480	My favorite one is the white swallow.
4042480	4043480	White swallow, baby.
4043480	4044480	The white swallow.
4044480	4046480	San Francisco's white swallow.
4046480	4048480	Jackhammer was there, too.
4048480	4049480	I like the Jackhammer.
4049480	4051480	I did a show at Jackhammer once,
4051480	4054480	and the entire time, porn was playing behind me.
4054480	4056480	It seems like the goal of naming these places is,
4056480	4059480	if you're a straight guy wandering in,
4059480	4063480	they want you to get two drinks in before you realize...
4063480	4065480	Manhole!
4065480	4067480	Fuck!
4067480	4070480	So many clues.
4070480	4071480	It was right under my nose.
4071480	4073480	Oh, shit, it was right under my nose.
4074480	4076480	Which services the guys that are also like,
4076480	4078480	I didn't know, but let's hang out here,
4078480	4079480	because we were already here.
4079480	4080480	Yeah.
4080480	4081480	I don't know if it's still here in LA,
4081480	4082480	but it used to be in Silver Lake,
4082480	4083480	and it might be a chain, I don't know,
4083480	4084480	but it was one in Silver Lake,
4084480	4086480	I think it's called Rough Trade.
4086480	4088480	That's not bearing the legal...
4088480	4090480	That sounds like a jean store.
4090480	4092480	Yeah, leather shop.
4092480	4094480	Or a saloon and gun smoke.
4094480	4095480	Yeah.
4095480	4096480	Ladies and gentlemen,
4096480	4099480	here's the proprietor of Rough Trade,
4099480	4101480	Mitch Hurwitz!
4102480	4103480	Oh, wow.
4113480	4116480	Because his bar is gay.
4117480	4119480	I went into Rough Trade,
4119480	4120480	sucked a million dicks,
4120480	4121480	went into Rough Trade,
4121480	4123480	and there were zero chicks.
4123480	4125480	I went into Rough...
4126480	4128480	All right.
4128480	4130480	Wait, what a life...
4130480	4132480	Oh, Camille just got bounced, okay.
4132480	4134480	No, Camille's retrieving another microphone.
4134480	4136480	Whoa, Camille's mic is hot.
4136480	4138480	The line at the white swallow tonight,
4138480	4140480	has anyone been down there?
4142480	4143480	So I'm sorry I'm late.
4143480	4144480	What did I miss?
4144480	4145480	Catch me up.
4145480	4146480	Really quickly.
4146480	4147480	South by Southwest, but great.
4147480	4148480	Okay.
4148480	4149480	Do you want to...
4149480	4150480	Can they replay it?
4150480	4151480	Do you want to just replay the...
4151480	4152480	Yeah, yeah.
4152480	4153480	Can we do playback for Mitch?
4153480	4154480	Honestly, he's an important guy.
4154480	4155480	Yeah, did it go great?
4155480	4156480	Do you want to hear my notes?
4156480	4158480	Because I take a couple of notes every show.
4158480	4159480	I have...
4159480	4160480	I'll tell you when.
4160480	4162480	316-14, post, South by Southwest.
4162480	4164480	Dr. Fred Phillips is dying, question mark.
4164480	4165480	Balut boy.
4165480	4167480	Oh, that sounds like a winner.
4167480	4169480	For that, uh...
4169480	4170480	Balut boy.
4170480	4172480	Fag enabler, Don Diego.
4176480	4178480	This needs to be a new segment.
4178480	4179480	Yeah, yeah.
4179480	4180480	And Spencer...
4180480	4181480	The show's so far.
4181480	4183480	Spencer is Beardy McGee.
4184480	4186480	Those are all the notes I've taken so far.
4187480	4188480	Fag enabler, Don Diego.
4188480	4189480	Fag enabler, Don Diego.
4189480	4190480	Puttin' in your eye.
4190480	4193480	If you ever see me taking a note, I'm writing down...
4193480	4195480	Erin, you're gonna have a garage sale for your charity thing, right?
4195480	4196480	Yeah.
4196480	4198480	So, Jeff, my charity.
4198480	4199480	Thank you.
4199480	4200480	It's not my charity.
4200480	4202480	It's 826LA, which is a great charity.
4202480	4207480	You may have noticed that during Dungeons and Dragons, Jeff is always taking notes in different
4207480	4208480	notebooks.
4208480	4215480	This Sunday, from 11 a.m. to 6 a.m. here in this space, we're having a garage sale, which
4215480	4221480	will mostly be dance stuff and stuff from all of us sitting around this room.
4221480	4222480	I don't know.
4222480	4225480	Obviously, it's not gonna be floating.
4225480	4228480	It will be following the laws of physics.
4228480	4229480	It will.
4229480	4231480	So, you won't be creeped out.
4231480	4233480	There's also gonna be a little bake sale.
4233480	4237480	But for you guys who can't, for you listeners who can't...
4237480	4239480	I don't know why I'm so nervous explaining this.
4239480	4240480	My face is like red hot.
4240480	4243480	Because inner city children will die if you...
4243480	4245480	That's the thing, is that we don't raise a certain amount of money.
4245480	4247480	Mitch Hurwitz's kids are going to die.
4247480	4250480	They're not gonna die, but they're not gonna feel good.
4250480	4251480	They're gonna feel...
4251480	4254480	They're gonna be very, very sickly.
4254480	4256480	Just a step up from what they are now.
4256480	4257480	There we go.
4257480	4259480	Which is dead?
4259480	4261480	No, they're extremely sick.
4261480	4262480	Okay.
4262480	4263480	They'll get better.
4263480	4265480	So, it'll be all sorts of garage sale things.
4265480	4268480	Mitch keeps his kids in an igloo cooler at home.
4269480	4272480	He turns the temperature up as each item is sold.
4276480	4278480	Which preserves their life, right?
4278480	4279480	Yeah.
4279480	4281480	They call me the smooth face dad.
4281480	4282480	I think it's...
4282480	4283480	Is that from True Detective?
4283480	4284480	I don't know.
4284480	4285480	Smooth face?
4285480	4286480	I don't know the reference.
4286480	4287480	That's a spaghetti face.
4287480	4288480	Spaghetti face.
4288480	4289480	That's what it is.
4289480	4290480	Yeah, opposite of smooth face.
4290480	4292480	I kind of hope that we can do another...
4292480	4293480	Because I just finished...
4293480	4294480	We'll get back there.
4294480	4295480	I watched all of...
4295480	4297480	I watched all of and really liked True Detective.
4297480	4298480	Right?
4298480	4299480	Yeah.
4299480	4300480	That's it.
4300480	4303480	I think that's what they've been waiting for here over the years.
4303480	4305480	Maybe we could do another little...
4305480	4308480	Another Pakistani hay and...
4308480	4309480	Pakistani hay.
4309480	4310480	That was Pakistani hay.
4310480	4311480	So really quick.
4311480	4315480	Were you confused about which one of us was Pakistani hay?
4317480	4318480	Sorry, Erin.
4318480	4319480	It's okay.
4319480	4322480	For those of you who can't come from 3 p.m.
4322480	4325480	to 6 p.m. Pacific time,
4325480	4328480	through a cool website called Kogo.
4328480	4330480	It's Kogo.tv.
4330480	4331480	We'll be streaming a...
4331480	4332480	K-O?
4332480	4334480	C-O-G-O.
4334480	4337480	We'll be streaming a QVC-style show
4337480	4341480	with Dan and guest co-host selling things via that.
4341480	4342480	And it's not going to be an auction.
4342480	4343480	It'll be like,
4343480	4345480	here's Dan's book,
4345480	4347480	because I found a few extra copies of
4347480	4349480	You'll Be Perfect When You're Dad.
4350480	4352480	Only a few.
4352480	4356480	But Dan will be hawking those via the QVC thing.
4356480	4358480	And another thing that we'll be selling
4358480	4360480	will be Jeff's Notes for D&D.
4360480	4361480	And then also...
4361480	4363480	Where I write down such words as,
4363480	4364480	Stub-Norts.
4364480	4367480	And that might be the whole entry for that show.
4367480	4369480	And all the money goes to 826LA.
4369480	4372480	Every cent goes to 826LA.
4372480	4374480	And it's like a kids' education thing, right?
4374480	4376480	I don't know what it is.
4377480	4380480	They're trying to make space aids.
4380480	4381480	No, it's great.
4381480	4384480	It's an organization that supports kids
4384480	4385480	learning how to write.
4385480	4387480	So it's very appropriate for this show.
4387480	4389480	I don't know enough about it,
4389480	4393480	but it sounds like the thing that I've always thought in my head
4393480	4394480	needs to...
4394480	4395480	That I would...
4395480	4397480	The charity that I would be interested in,
4397480	4399480	which is the idea that kids need to...
4399480	4400480	It started by...
4400480	4401480	I forget his name.
4401480	4402480	Heartbreaking Workers.
4402480	4403480	David Eggers.
4403480	4405480	It's his charity.
4405480	4406480	And yeah...
4406480	4407480	So this is...
4407480	4409480	You know, I've got Stop Writing Kids.
4409480	4411480	And I don't know if that's a difference.
4411480	4414480	It's a different message, but we can still team up.
4414480	4415480	Yeah.
4415480	4418480	It seems so anti what you guys are trying to do, though.
4418480	4422480	I just read in DeFamer that we're doing a secret project together,
4422480	4424480	and I think that should be it.
4424480	4425480	Yeah, Stop Writing Kids.
4425480	4428480	Let's stop, start writing kids together.
4428480	4430480	So your charity is just telling kids, like,
4430480	4431480	Really?
4431480	4433480	This is what you want to do?
4434480	4436480	Where's the story structure flagstones?
4436480	4439480	Yeah, and it's about how...
4439480	4441480	The spec script is really dead,
4441480	4443480	and you're not going to get a job from it.
4443480	4446480	It's just showing kids, and you show them, like,
4446480	4451480	60 millimeter films of writers dying alone.
4451480	4453480	Yeah.
4453480	4454480	Exactly.
4454480	4456480	So it'll be worth coming by.
4456480	4459480	Also, original art by Jeff and Dan and myself.
4459480	4461480	I don't know, Jeff, if you remember,
4461480	4464480	but when we were first hanging out, we got drunk and painted some things.
4464480	4465480	We'll be selling those.
4465480	4466480	All right.
4466480	4467480	Sounds great.
4467480	4468480	Also...
4468480	4470480	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
4470480	4472480	I was drunk.
4472480	4475480	I'll double check with Spencer, but also we'll have character sheets
4475480	4478480	and lots of stuff, so come by.
4478480	4481480	They could be Spencer stuff for sale.
4481480	4483480	Anybody else got anything to talk about?
4483480	4485480	Yeah, I wouldn't mind talking about snaps.com.
4485480	4488480	You know, it's such a pain in the neck.
4488480	4492480	When you have to bring the mail,
4492480	4497480	and I found this crazy great site...
4497480	4499480	How does it work?
4499480	4501480	Wait, you have to go to the post office?
4501480	4502480	Because I'm sick of doing that.
4502480	4508480	Look, all the post offices are turning into steak houses, right?
4508480	4509480	Right?
4509480	4510480	Who's with me?
4510480	4513480	This guy knows what I'm talking about.
4513480	4515480	How am I going to weigh my postage?
4515480	4516480	That's the thing.
4516480	4517480	They come to your house.
4517480	4518480	I don't know.
4518480	4521480	I fast forward to the first 10 minutes of Mark Marin's podcast,
4521480	4523480	so I don't know the specifics of it.
4523480	4524480	I skipped that part.
4524480	4526480	Kevin Pollack does stamps.com, too.
4526480	4527480	Yeah.
4527480	4529480	I remember I had to sit through a lot of stamps.com.
4529480	4531480	You know what this podcast doesn't do?
4531480	4532480	It doesn't do advertising.
4532480	4534480	This podcast makes zero money.
4534480	4536480	We used to do Nike ads a lot.
4536480	4537480	Charity.
4537480	4538480	Yeah.
4538480	4539480	We're definitely open to it.
4539480	4543480	I just don't want any of these stamps.com assholes coming around.
4544480	4546480	I want Mountain Dew Kickstarter or some shit.
4546480	4547480	Yeah.
4547480	4548480	I want Toyota.
4548480	4549480	I want fucking...
4549480	4550480	You know what it should be.
4550480	4551480	Here's the angle.
4551480	4553480	In South by Southwest, I learned a lot about marketing
4553480	4555480	because people would drive you around in cars that were like Chevy,
4555480	4557480	just sponsoring free rides and you get in their car,
4557480	4560480	and they kind of required to kind of give you a pitch about their car.
4560480	4567480	And I sat in a car with these gals that are Mountain Dew marketing people.
4567480	4569480	Spencer, you're a big Mountain Dew guy.
4569480	4571480	Yeah, I'm wearing a Mountain Dew shirt right now.
4571480	4572480	Oh, see?
4572480	4573480	No shit.
4573480	4576480	See, like Spencer should do a Mountain Dew piece every once in a while.
4576480	4577480	I think he just did.
4577480	4579480	His beard looks like an upside-down mountain.
4579480	4580480	It's true.
4582480	4585480	Like a reflection in Mountain Dew of a mountain.
4585480	4587480	That's what your beard looks like.
4587480	4588480	It tastes like that, too.
4588480	4591480	Spencer, let's just do...
4591480	4593480	Not to put you in the spot, but you're an improviser.
4593480	4596480	You're a Dungeon Master extraordinaire and extreme.
4596480	4599480	I think Mountain Dew is an extreme drink.
4599480	4600480	Oh, yeah.
4601480	4604480	Can we maybe hear a Mountain Dew spot,
4604480	4606480	just kind of riff one for us right now?
4610480	4612480	Should it be like a weird D&D?
4612480	4614480	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4614480	4617480	Climbing out of the pits of Skaldor,
4617480	4620480	your thirst, it needs quenching.
4621480	4625480	As you rise to the top, there's a vicious ogre.
4625480	4629480	The kind of ogre that doesn't just take traditional hydration
4629480	4634480	to defeat, but the electrolyte caffeine-infused fusion
4634480	4636480	of Mountain Dew code red.
4636480	4638480	Code red and...
4638480	4639480	I don't know.
4641480	4642480	Yes.
4643480	4644480	Yes.
4644480	4647480	I would say if we could go back,
4647480	4649480	the ogre's name should be Thirst, right?
4649480	4651480	Oh, fuck.
4651480	4652480	I mean, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
4652480	4654480	If we're going to write this thing,
4654480	4656480	it'll be Citizen Kane.
4656480	4657480	But in the meantime,
4657480	4659480	I'm trying to make money.
4659480	4661480	I want to make money.
4661480	4664480	May I request that Spencer does an ad
4664480	4666480	for the Sunday's charity garage sale?
4666480	4668480	I was going to say, first, you might want to do
4668480	4671480	like an anti-Mountain Dew ad, you know what I mean?
4671480	4674480	So that they don't just feel like they've got free publicity.
4674480	4676480	So they can know what milk will unleash.
4676480	4677480	Yeah, exactly.
4677480	4678480	Oh, yeah.
4678480	4679480	That's valuable.
4679480	4681480	Give Mountain Dew a taste of what they'll get
4681480	4682480	if they don't sponsor.
4682480	4684480	We'll be happy to drop one of the Mountain Dew ads
4684480	4686480	if you guys want to play ball.
4686480	4688480	Yeah, this is what it looks like if you're on our site.
4688480	4690480	This is what it looks like if you're not.
4690480	4691480	You can bring the sunshine.
4691480	4694480	You can also bring the rain.
4694480	4695480	Bring the rain.
4695480	4696480	Bring the rain, Spencer.
4696480	4697480	Maybe an upbeat piece.
4697480	4701480	I don't even know what an anti-Mountain Dew commercial is.
4701480	4704480	Climbing up the pits of Skaldor.
4704480	4706480	You need to slake your thirst,
4706480	4711480	but with something that's not going to shrink your testicles.
4711480	4717480	Where else can you turn but see you're a mist?
4717480	4718480	Nice.
4718480	4719480	All right.
4719480	4720480	Now you're covered.
4720480	4722480	All right.
4722480	4724480	You hear us, Mountain Dew?
4724480	4725480	I'm sure.
4725480	4727480	You've been warned.
4727480	4728480	Sorry.
4728480	4729480	And now to potentially bring the room down,
4729480	4732480	can we hear an ad for 826 L.A.
4732480	4734480	and a Hermitone security sale?
4734480	4735480	All right.
4735480	4736480	Yes, yes.
4736480	4738480	Give us an ominous D&D advertisement for 826.
4738480	4740480	Climbing out of the pits of extra money
4740480	4741480	you have lying around.
4741480	4745480	You enter a lair full of knickknacks thrown aside
4745480	4748480	by people more famous than yourself.
4748480	4751480	But can you truly clasp, crap,
4751480	4753480	grasp some of their glory and fame
4753480	4757480	just by owning some of their trinkets and items?
4757480	4758480	Yes.
4758480	4759480	Yes.
4759480	4761480	Give me your money.
4761480	4764480	All right.
4764480	4767480	And if you could do an anti-one of those too,
4767480	4772480	that way we're...
4772480	4775480	Just to balance it out, yeah.
4775480	4776480	You got to...
4776480	4778480	Now, just to kind of even things out
4778480	4780480	as we've been doing with you, Spencer,
4780480	4786480	Mitch, I want you to do an ad for stamps.com
4786480	4789480	but as Robin Williams.
4789480	4795480	I really don't know how this idea that I do Robin Williams started.
4796480	4800480	Oh, you want to lick something.
4800480	4803480	But it only costs 15 cents.
4803480	4805480	It's a pretty nasty prostitute.
4805480	4810480	A three-pound brimstone.
4810480	4813480	Stamp shocker.
4816480	4817480	All right, all right, okay.
4817480	4819480	Boy, we're on a roll.
4819480	4824480	This is big of a cavalcade of stars.
4825480	4826480	It's a cavalcade of ads.
4826480	4829480	I mean, it seems almost in Congress to go into it,
4829480	4831480	but Spencer, shall we dispense some character sheets
4831480	4833480	and maybe play some D&D for the good people?
4833480	4835480	Yeah, we haven't discussed this.
4835480	4837480	You're back, so does you being back
4837480	4840480	mean that you want to play a little chapter of D&D?
4840480	4841480	Yeah, sure.
4841480	4842480	Okay, all right.
4842480	4843480	I don't know what anything means.
4843480	4845480	We played some at the Hermitat one.
4845480	4846480	We were in South by Southwest.
4846480	4847480	Well, yeah, we did.
4847480	4850480	Yeah, but that was fucking for the locals.
4850480	4852480	They don't know what's happening.
4852480	4854480	Did you assume the same Hermitat?
4854480	4857480	Do you feel refreshed from your hiatus?
4857480	4862480	Yeah, I mean, I've never DM'd a game that many sessions
4862480	4864480	without taking a break before, so...
4864480	4865480	It was starting to show.
4865480	4867480	Oh, no, I know.
4867480	4868480	Oh, I'm kidding.
4868480	4870480	I know it all seems exactly the same.
4870480	4871480	Well, you're absolutely right.
4871480	4872480	I'll be the first to invent.
4872480	4873480	Which is worse.
4873480	4874480	It's cool.
4874480	4875480	It's cool, Mitch.
4875480	4879480	I respect your opinion as a professional, so...
4879480	4881480	I'll hand out the sheets and...
4881480	4884480	I don't get why that was a joke.
4884480	4885480	No, it's funny.
4885480	4886480	I don't know.
4886480	4888480	Sometimes things don't have to be jokes to be funny.
4888480	4897480	Believe me, my house payments are dependent on it.
4897480	4898480	What?
4898480	4901480	I just thought Dan was going to go into a monologue about it.
4901480	4903480	Paying house payments with bad jokes.
4903480	4908480	It just seems like it's about Mountain Dew now.
4908480	4910480	Tricking people into thinking.
4910480	4911480	You have insight.
4911480	4916480	Your mansion gets bigger and bigger.
4916480	4920480	You invested in a cartoon studio, which will be your undoing.
4920480	4921480	All right.
4921480	4923480	That's Quark.
4923480	4924480	Really?
4924480	4926480	Well, yeah, I...
4926480	4927480	Yeah.
4927480	4929480	Starbuns.
4929480	4930480	In Burbank.
4930480	4931480	Oh, in Burbank?
4931480	4932480	Is Starbuns doing well now?
4932480	4934480	Rick and Morty's got to be bringing in some money.
4935480	4938480	Here's Krista Berg's character sheet.
4938480	4939480	Okay.
4939480	4940480	No, we're doing well.
4940480	4941480	We're doing fine.
4941480	4944480	Is Mitch still playing the Avenger?
4944480	4948480	Yeah, I guess Mitch should reprise his role as Mike Falcon.
4948480	4953480	Yeah, that's great, because then I just kind of hang out and just kind of carve on your shoulder.
4953480	4955480	Soar over me.
4955480	4957480	Cast a shadow on me.
4957480	4960480	Let me look up to you.
4960480	4963480	It works on so many levels.
4963480	4964480	All right.
4964480	4965480	All right.
4965480	4966480	So...
4966480	4967480	Are we good to go?
4967480	4968480	We poised?
4968480	4969480	Sure.
4969480	4970480	Spencer, I'm going to go...
4970480	4973480	I'm going to go David Bowie Labyrinth Hallucination theme on you.
4973480	4974480	I think he's just...
4974480	4975480	Shake it up a bit.
4975480	4977480	All right.
4977480	4980480	All right.
4980480	4983480	Last time on Harman Town.
4984480	4986480	All right.
4988480	4990480	Last time on Harman Town.
4990480	4998480	After being released from skeleton bondage and finding the Marsh Minotaur, our heroes began to plot their escape.
4998480	5009480	Together with the Minotaur's aid, the gang trekked back to the hole from which they fell, and using his teleportation cape, Sharpie quickly found himself topside.
5009480	5019480	The rest of the adventurers weren't so lucky, and found they had to climb up Meredith the Minotaur's crazy, ridiculous ladder.
5019480	5029480	As they ascended, they were beset by their greatest fears, Pumas, long-term relationships, and not having the appropriate crafts.
5030480	5037480	Mulrane fell from the ladder in terror, but eventually the gang faced their fears and climbed to freedom.
5037480	5042480	And then they all gathered around a fire while Sharpie sang an old wharven spiritual.
5042480	5047480	But what would they do now in the harsh, unforgiving, frozen wastelands of the north?
5047480	5050480	And what of their skull curses?
5050480	5057480	Let's find out this time, hopefully, on an all-new episode of Stuff Thing Happened to Harman Town.
5057480	5064480	With a soundtrack that's getting a little cagney and lacy right there at the end.
5064480	5070480	That cagney and lacy part kicked in right at the right time, too.
5070480	5073480	Spencer has an innate sense of that kind of stuff.
5073480	5084480	I want to make a bit about how I want Spencer to be at my bedside recapping my blackout drugs, but I know I probably made that bet during some blackout drug at some point.
5084480	5087480	And, you know, he's been doing it for, like, three years.
5087480	5090480	You really don't remember that. You do not remember that.
5090480	5094480	Every night. Spencer, skull curses?
5094480	5098480	I don't know. I think I called them skull curses the last time I did an intro.
5098480	5104480	But, yeah, I remember when you were under court and then you were like, you've got to kill the marshmallows.
5104480	5109480	And then you were like, what if we don't? And then they were like, you're going to fucking die.
5109480	5112480	All right. Gotcha. All right. So we did it.
5112480	5115480	All right. So are we with Meredith the Minotaur right now?
5115480	5121480	Yeah. And you're up. You're finally above ground again in the frozen wastelands of the north.
5121480	5125480	You're around this campfire, you know, you're digging it.
5125480	5129480	You're kind of enjoying having climbed up this ridiculously tall ladder.
5129480	5136480	She starts pulling the ladder out of the hole and then it's like looking around the ice trying to figure out where you guys are.
5137480	5142480	I take my compatriots aside. Well, Marsh Minotaur, what's her name?
5142480	5144480	Meredith.
5144480	5153480	Well, she handles her ladder and I go, I think they put like timers on us, didn't they?
5153480	5159480	Wasn't there somebody ticking clock? They know if the Minotaur gets killed or not.
5159480	5162480	But now she's our friend. We can't just kill her, can we?
5162480	5168480	Why don't we take her back and be like, hey, she's cool. Maybe they'll understand, right? Don't you think so?
5168480	5173480	Well, I don't know if you've met Sharpie before, but yeah, he's not good with authority.
5173480	5175480	No, but you're OK with Meredith.
5175480	5179480	Yeah, I mean, better to do that than kill her.
5179480	5182480	I don't know why she gave us this shitty ladder.
5182480	5186480	It was a bad ladder, but it got us up out of the hole.
5186480	5187480	It's the best ladder she had.
5187480	5189480	Am I still taking Puma damage or am I healed up now?
5189480	5194480	No, you haven't healed. You've taken 20 damage Puma damage.
5194480	5197480	Is my dick still cut off and in a pit somewhere?
5197480	5200480	Yeah, well, it's in the very pit you just climbed out of.
5200480	5204480	Shit, my dick was down there? Can I use the ladder real quick?
5204480	5207480	Guys, we really are, you know, we're tight on time.
5207480	5208480	OK, sorry about my...
5208480	5210480	Do you absolutely need it?
5210480	5213480	Yeah, do you need yours? Well, you're a falcon.
5213480	5215480	He's a falcon.
5215480	5218480	I feel like, OK, how about this?
5218480	5221480	I'm just going to run down. I just want my dick back.
5221480	5222480	We're in such a hurry.
5222480	5224480	Do I still have my old one?
5224480	5225480	What?
5225480	5227480	I mean, I change sexes. Do I still have my old dick?
5227480	5228480	No.
5228480	5229480	OK.
5229480	5230480	The extra parts don't just fall.
5230480	5231480	I know we're in a hurry.
5231480	5233480	We're in such a hurry.
5233480	5236480	But I wonder, maybe somebody will have some power that regenerates dicks.
5236480	5237480	We've got to move, man.
5237480	5239480	We'll get you a magic dick. Don't worry about it.
5239480	5243480	I don't want a magic dick. I want my dick.
5244480	5246480	I know how to work magic with it.
5251480	5253480	All right. Fine.
5253480	5256480	But can we promise, once we're done, we'll come back and grab my dick?
5256480	5258480	I don't think we can promise that.
5258480	5260480	If only we had...
5260480	5264480	If only we had a being that could fly down and grab it.
5264480	5267480	You said falcon adventure down after the dick.
5267480	5268480	That's so funny, because I just went down there,
5268480	5272480	and there was this kind of thick but short worm.
5273480	5274480	Oh, my God.
5274480	5276480	Was it circumcised worm?
5276480	5277480	Yes.
5277480	5279480	That's my dick.
5279480	5280480	I'm so sorry.
5280480	5281480	What did you do with it?
5281480	5284480	Well, what do birds do with worms?
5284480	5287480	Oh, my God. Were you the early bird?
5289480	5292480	Did you get my morning wood?
5293480	5298480	The good news is it was fine when I vomited into my children's mouths.
5298480	5300480	Adventure, you have children?
5300480	5301480	Yeah.
5301480	5302480	OK.
5302480	5304480	During the lead, let's focus on...
5304480	5306480	I mean, we've just never had a chance to talk about our personal lives.
5306480	5309480	I know. I know. I know who I want to all the time.
5309480	5310480	And I feel like I...
5310480	5312480	Jacob is 11.
5313480	5315480	OK. Did he eat my dick?
5315480	5317480	The 11-year-old?
5317480	5320480	He regurged. He re-ate, re-swallowed.
5320480	5322480	Just keep an eye out on their stool.
5322480	5324480	By the way, he wants to write.
5324480	5326480	Really? Jacob wants to write.
5326480	5329480	He wrote a community. He wrote a spec community.
5329480	5331480	I didn't think it was very good, but would you mind reading it?
5331480	5333480	Absolutely. No problem.
5333480	5336480	It's like a season's forest back.
5338480	5341480	It was heavy on Jonathan Banks. What season was that?
5341480	5342480	That's this one.
5342480	5343480	Oh, it's this one.
5343480	5345480	OK. So he's watching him, I guess.
5350480	5354480	All right. So we're leaving the dick.
5354480	5356480	At this point, really, the dick has been...
5356480	5359480	In game time, I think the dick's been severed so long that...
5359480	5360480	It does seem like it.
5361480	5363480	You're thinking like a modern person.
5363480	5365480	Like my falcon says,
5365480	5369480	you have more chance of growing magically a new dick
5369480	5372480	than you do of, like, surgically doing anything with that.
5372480	5374480	I have a backpack and a sewing kit.
5374480	5376480	But I don't have the dick.
5376480	5378480	No, I know. But I'm just saying.
5378480	5381480	If you guys want to go back down that magic ladder...
5381480	5383480	No, but he said he's...
5383480	5385480	There's no dick.
5385480	5386480	No dick.
5386480	5389480	I go up to Meredith and I say, Meredith, look, here's the deal.
5390480	5392480	There was a contract out in your life, basically,
5392480	5394480	and we're supposed to kill you,
5394480	5396480	but you saved our lives more or less.
5396480	5398480	You got us out of the pit.
5398480	5399480	We're not going to do that.
5399480	5400480	Good.
5400480	5403480	We're going to take you back to the people.
5403480	5404480	Is that the way to do this?
5404480	5405480	Well, we also have...
5405480	5407480	What did they do? They cast a spell on us or something?
5407480	5409480	On our souls, on our very souls.
5409480	5413480	If you're not dead within a certain period of time,
5413480	5415480	we basically die.
5415480	5418480	We're fine with that, because I fucking hate authority.
5419480	5422480	I'd rather die than do anything these assholes want me to do,
5422480	5426480	but I'm just wondering if you could help us think of any solution to this.
5428480	5430480	All right, terrific.
5430480	5433480	Of all the people to be a hero for.
5433480	5435480	On your souls?
5435480	5438480	Yeah, it's like a timer.
5438480	5443480	I don't know, man. You'd have to deal with someone crazy magic
5443480	5445480	to try and knock that off.
5445480	5446480	Are you crazy magic?
5446480	5447480	No, no.
5447480	5448480	But you know somebody.
5448480	5449480	Oh, no.
5449480	5450480	Yeah, you do.
5450480	5452480	I just know that there's magic that exists
5452480	5455480	and sounds like you got magic and other magics can un-magic.
5455480	5456480	That's right.
5456480	5461480	We've got to get these spell bombs diffused from us before the deadline.
5461480	5462480	Aren't you a magician?
5462480	5464480	Don't you have any spells that can do this?
5464480	5467480	Yeah, I cast Charmed Squirrel.
5468480	5470480	I'll be the first to admit.
5470480	5472480	I'm just kind of new at this.
5472480	5473480	He's open-miking.
5473480	5475480	What about the pteragon?
5475480	5476480	Aren't we still dealing with...
5476480	5478480	We have to go to Paradise and find the pteragon of virtue
5478480	5481480	to get to lift Krista Berg's spell, too?
5481480	5482480	That sounds right to me.
5482480	5484480	I've got a couple things going on right now.
5484480	5486480	Yeah, but one of those is just getting lower on the tongue ball.
5486480	5487480	Can we use Meredith?
5487480	5489480	We are not going to be able to do all of these.
5489480	5490480	We can.
5490480	5492480	Meredith, do you know where Paradise is?
5492480	5494480	Can we use ladder and get us to Paradise?
5494480	5497480	Well, if we found it, we could probably get up there with the ladder, yeah.
5497480	5499480	But I don't know where it is.
5499480	5500480	For great sake.
5500480	5501480	It floats around.
5501480	5502480	Does it exist?
5502480	5506480	It's on this physical plane, but above us?
5506480	5507480	Yes.
5507480	5508480	We just have to find it.
5508480	5509480	Yes.
5509480	5510480	Okay.
5510480	5511480	What kind of creatures do business with them?
5511480	5513480	They must have imports and exports.
5513480	5516480	I don't know people...
5516480	5518480	I guess people probably live there.
5518480	5519480	You've heard of them.
5519480	5522480	Can we send Avenger to go fly around and do some recon for us?
5522480	5523480	I mean, I could just check it out.
5523480	5524480	Avenger?
5524480	5525480	Yeah.
5525480	5526480	Go up in the air.
5526480	5529480	Fly around until you bump into a paradise.
5529480	5530480	I'm going to go look for it.
5530480	5532480	And again, I won't be able to pick up your thing.
5532480	5534480	I don't mean to beat a dead dick, but if you see one...
5534480	5535480	No, no, no, no.
5535480	5536480	I can't do it.
5536480	5538480	I can't do it because now they want me to do this thing where I fly around.
5538480	5539480	I'm not going to go.
5539480	5540480	All right.
5540480	5542480	Well, in your travels, if you happen to see one, just grab it.
5542480	5545480	We're going to get you such a nice magic dick.
5545480	5546480	You're not going to miss me.
5546480	5548480	I don't want a nice magic dick.
5548480	5550480	I just want my dick.
5550480	5551480	We're really in a big hurry.
5551480	5555480	If you ever do want to save time, there's this thing called stamps.com.
5555480	5559480	I just want to really quickly just go for it one more time.
5559480	5562480	Sending letters is getting faster and faster.
5562480	5563480	All right.
5563480	5565480	So I fly up.
5565480	5566480	I fly up.
5566480	5568480	I have no sheet or anything, but I just fly up.
5568480	5573480	And I'm communicating with one of these earthbound creatures.
5573480	5574480	Me?
5574480	5575480	Yeah.
5575480	5576480	Your friend?
5576480	5577480	Whoa.
5577480	5578480	What is that?
5578480	5579480	I think I saw...
5579480	5580480	Whoa.
5580480	5581480	What the heck is this thing?
5581480	5582480	Is it a dick?
5582480	5583480	Paradise.
5583480	5584480	You look for paradise.
5584480	5585480	It's like a...
5585480	5588480	It's almost like a really nice condo development.
5589480	5592480	Paradise Gardens, it says.
5592480	5593480	But that...
5593480	5595480	Could that be it?
5597480	5598480	Yeah.
5598480	5600480	They have a 24-hour health club.
5600480	5601480	Yeah.
5601480	5603480	So you see that.
5603480	5605480	You with your hawk eyes.
5605480	5606480	That's...
5606480	5609480	It's just floating in midair, apparently.
5609480	5610480	You see that.
5610480	5614480	And then you feel like you should return and report what you saw.
5615480	5619480	Guys, my hawk says he saw a city that could be paradise,
5619480	5621480	but he fucks around a lot.
5621480	5623480	Like, it could be a bit, too.
5623480	5624480	I can't tell.
5624480	5625480	It's not a bit.
5625480	5627480	No, it's not a bit.
5627480	5629480	But it does look like a condo development.
5629480	5631480	How high off the ground is it?
5634480	5635480	What?
5635480	5637480	You know, I can do it in wing flaps.
5637480	5639480	It's like 28...
5639480	5640480	I don't even know.
5640480	5642480	Like 2,800 wing flaps.
5645480	5646480	What is that?
5646480	5648480	What does that even translate into?
5648480	5649480	Spencer, how many...
5649480	5650480	How high is that?
5650480	5654480	You look to 28 wing flaps or whatever high.
5654480	5656480	You see nothing.
5656480	5660480	You wonder what the natural landscape and environment
5660480	5663480	and temperature normally is for a hawk.
5663480	5666480	It's probably not freezing.
5666480	5668480	So it's not crazy high.
5668480	5670480	Or he's nuts because...
5670480	5672480	He's crazy high.
5673480	5675480	There was a headwind.
5675480	5676480	Or there was a headwind.
5676480	5677480	Have you ever flown?
5677480	5679480	I mean, did you know anything about it?
5679480	5681480	How many flaps do you think...
5681480	5683480	But I would say, all right, if you want a number,
5683480	5686480	I would say it's about 200 feet, 250.
5686480	5688480	My hawk has lost it.
5688480	5691480	We've got to just traipse across this fucking tundra
5691480	5693480	until we either die or come to a place
5693480	5697480	where somebody can help us find paradise.
5697480	5698480	Yeah.
5698480	5699480	What a terrible...
5699480	5700480	Is Coco nearby?
5700480	5701480	Coco's here.
5702480	5703480	Coco!
5703480	5706480	I guess that's how I call her now.
5706480	5710480	I jump on Coco when I ride off trying to scout.
5710480	5711480	All right.
5711480	5713480	In what direction?
5713480	5715480	All?
5715480	5719480	So just like a rapid, slowly increasing circle,
5719480	5721480	like a spiral.
5721480	5723480	Seems inefficient, but go for it.
5723480	5724480	Oh, there she is.
5724480	5726480	Oh, there she is.
5726480	5727480	There she is.
5727480	5729480	When?
5729480	5731480	Oh, there she is.
5731480	5733480	She's a little farther now.
5733480	5734480	Uh-huh.
5734480	5736480	Not much farther each time.
5736480	5738480	Away from the hole.
5738480	5740480	Mm-hmm.
5740480	5742480	Just the way I live my life.
5742480	5745480	Away from the hole towards like...
5745480	5747480	Don't ask why, just think about it.
5747480	5748480	Just let go.
5748480	5753480	The place where I would think the most tarragon would be.
5753480	5756480	Maybe like the greenest spot.
5756480	5757480	Tarragon?
5757480	5758480	Northeast.
5758480	5759480	Oh.
5759480	5760480	Northeast.
5760480	5763480	You head northeast for some time.
5763480	5768480	You don't really see anything until you might see something.
5768480	5769480	Yeah.
5769480	5773480	Until you happen upon a brown sack.
5774480	5775480	You should take that.
5775480	5776480	You should take that.
5776480	5777480	He found a brown sack.
5777480	5779480	Sorry, I was distracted by Adam Goldberg's ringer,
5779480	5781480	which was his mom saying, you're okay.
5781480	5782480	You're okay.
5783480	5787480	Adam Goldberg's ringtone is an older woman's voice saying,
5787480	5790480	just tell him you're doing the best you can.
5792480	5793480	Stay true to yourself.
5793480	5794480	If they don't like you,
5794480	5797480	then they shouldn't have been your friends in the first place.
5797480	5800480	I don't think Adam needs to be told to be true to himself.
5800480	5803480	If anything, he's got that down.
5803480	5804480	Exactly.
5804480	5806480	Let's put it on vibrate.
5807480	5808480	I'm sorry.
5808480	5809480	I find a brown sack.
5809480	5810480	Yep.
5810480	5811480	Brown sack.
5812480	5814480	You see it from your horse.
5814480	5817480	It's one of the only things that's anywhere in the snow.
5818480	5819480	Okay.
5819480	5821480	I dismount.
5821480	5823480	I give Coco's me, you know,
5823480	5827480	a very quick brush just to let her know that I still have her in mind.
5827480	5830480	And I approach the sack.
5831480	5835480	And I inspect it.
5835480	5838480	It looks like it has a writing on it.
5838480	5840480	It does have writing on it.
5840480	5841480	It's written in gnomish though.
5841480	5843480	It says Mountain Dew.
5843480	5845480	If you guys are.
5846480	5847480	Do you read gnomish?
5847480	5848480	We pay the bills.
5848480	5849480	I read Elvis.
5849480	5850480	Okay.
5850480	5851480	So you can't read it.
5851480	5854480	Some gnomish letters that you can't understand.
5854480	5856480	It's definitely a sack.
5856480	5857480	Okay.
5857480	5861480	I pick up the sack.
5861480	5864480	I put it on Coco.
5864480	5866480	And I return to the party.
5866480	5868480	That happens.
5869480	5872480	So anyways, that's how you tie a rope.
5872480	5874480	Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.
5874480	5875480	Ten CCs.
5875480	5876480	I thought you said Tennessee.
5876480	5878480	Quark, quark, quark.
5878480	5879480	Yeah.
5879480	5882480	I was just finishing my famous Doctor Tennessee joke.
5882480	5884480	You're intimate with sacks.
5884480	5885480	You're intimate with sacks, right?
5885480	5886480	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
5886480	5889480	I recognize the writing on that as gnomish.
5889480	5891480	I thought Jeff was a literate.
5891480	5893480	Who's Jeff?
5893480	5895480	Who's Jeff, motherfucker?
5895480	5896480	Quark.
5896480	5897480	I'm a literate?
5897480	5898480	Is that your own culture?
5898480	5899480	I guess not.
5899480	5900480	Shit.
5900480	5903480	Oh, shit.
5903480	5906480	Do you know, like, are you in touch with anybody?
5906480	5909480	You could pop to.
5909480	5912480	We flash back to Quark as a little kid.
5912480	5915480	When did we establish that he was a literate?
5915480	5917480	It's actually not, it's not either anymore.
5917480	5919480	My old character, she, I am.
5919480	5920480	Oh yeah, that's right.
5920480	5924480	Because the Pathfinder, Pathfinder barbarians aren't illiterate.
5924480	5925480	Does he admit to it?
5925480	5926480	Yeah, you're good now.
5926480	5928480	Because of Pathfinder rules.
5928480	5929480	We changed books.
5929480	5931480	I learned how to read.
5931480	5933480	That's how it goes.
5933480	5935480	Yeah, so you can read it.
5935480	5937480	It's like a fucking Keanu and Matrix.
5937480	5938480	That's how you learn how to read.
5938480	5940480	I'm like, fucking read now.
5940480	5941480	Are Keanu Reeves going to read?
5941480	5943480	Are you cool with that, sir?
5943480	5946480	Never heard anyone say that.
5946480	5949480	That's pretty amazing knowledge that you remember.
5949480	5953480	Seems like that should be rewarded more than us.
5954480	5956480	It's Spencer's World, I don't know.
5956480	5959480	This guy knows.
5959480	5960480	It's Spencer's World.
5960480	5962480	You're just remembering every tiny moment of it.
5962480	5965480	I pick up the bag and go, guys, I can't read.
5965480	5969480	And I look at it and go, whoa.
5969480	5972480	I know noamish.
5972480	5974480	Sound it out.
5974480	5975480	Huh?
5975480	5976480	Sound it out.
5976480	5981480	It says Bill Martigan's.
5981480	5984480	Clearly, it belongs to a guy named Bill Martigan.
5984480	5988480	Or maybe it's the name of an Irish pub.
5988480	5992480	Can you tell me where he abides?
5992480	5993480	I read.
5993480	5994480	Kevin Rooney always used to do that.
5994480	5995480	I read about him.
5995480	5997480	He'd be in Shakespeare or something.
5997480	6000480	Can you tell me where the solicitor abides?
6000480	6002480	That's Bill and Ted.
6002480	6003480	Yeah.
6003480	6004480	OK.
6004480	6010480	Cork, you recognize Bill Martigan as a noamish name.
6010480	6012480	You're not in touch with your noamish roots,
6012480	6014480	so you don't really know what it is,
6014480	6017480	but it definitely rings a bell in your vernacular.
6017480	6019480	I open the sack.
6019480	6023480	You open the sack and out pours golden light.
6023480	6024480	Whoa.
6024480	6026480	That's all you can see is golden light.
6026480	6030480	I bend backward at the hip, kind of like I'm dodging the light.
6030480	6031480	That happens.
6031480	6032480	That happens.
6032480	6033480	You guys see golden light spill out.
6033480	6037480	Nobody does golden light like Bill Martigan's.
6037480	6040480	I just want to, and I know I've been plugging a lot.
6040480	6043480	BillMartigan's.com for the best golden light.
6043480	6044480	They do it best.
6044480	6045480	Yeah.
6045480	6046480	They'll come to your house.
6046480	6049480	If you want light and you want it golden,
6049480	6052480	there's only one place to go.
6052480	6056480	Get a sack of friendship.
6056480	6058480	What's in the...
6058480	6059480	What's in the bag?
6059480	6063480	Bill Martigan's.
6068480	6070480	Yeah, so there's golden light up in this bag.
6070480	6071480	It's just pouring out.
6071480	6074480	You can't even see into it because it's so bright.
6074480	6075480	I reach into the bag.
6075480	6078480	You reach into the bag and you feel around.
6078480	6082480	It feels like a solid dirt ground.
6082480	6084480	You're reaching into the ground.
6084480	6088480	It's really good, you guys.
6088480	6090480	Can we try and put the gold back in the bag?
6090480	6092480	It's light.
6092480	6096480	I'll ask the question again.
6097480	6099480	Can you put...
6099480	6101480	It feels like ground at the bottom.
6101480	6104480	Does it feel like there's a spatial differential?
6104480	6107480	If you reach your hand all the way down into the bag, does it...
6107480	6108480	Oh, is it like Mary Poppins' bag?
6108480	6109480	Is that what you're asking?
6109480	6110480	Yes.
6110480	6111480	It's like Mary Poppins' bag.
6111480	6112480	It's like that.
6112480	6113480	Does anyone have high knowledge of magic?
6113480	6116480	Well, okay, someone tell me who's seen Mary Poppins.
6116480	6118480	It's just a bag that...
6118480	6123480	Because as far as I know, here's how that movie goes.
6123480	6124480	Yeah, fix it, Dan.
6124480	6129480	And some chick shows up, flies around in an umbrella.
6129480	6130480	You don't remember her handbag?
6130480	6131480	And everyone dies.
6131480	6134480	Oh, she's got a wonderful bag.
6134480	6135480	I've never seen Mary Poppins.
6135480	6136480	What does that mean?
6136480	6137480	What does it mean?
6137480	6138480	It just means it's...
6138480	6139480	We have a bag with everything in foot.
6139480	6140480	It's bigger than it looks.
6140480	6141480	A bag of holding.
6141480	6142480	A bag of infitude, yeah.
6142480	6143480	It's like a bag of holding, yeah.
6143480	6144480	Infitude?
6144480	6145480	What did you say?
6145480	6147480	I may have said that.
6147480	6148480	I don't know if that one is bigger.
6148480	6149480	She's got a hat-track in there.
6149480	6152480	Wait, didn't you say it felt like earth or dirt inside it?
6152480	6154480	Yeah, it feels like dirt, so...
6154480	6156480	Pull some dirt out.
6156480	6159480	I don't want you to tell me what to do.
6159480	6163480	I reach into the bag and grab the earth that she feels.
6163480	6165480	Yeah, you can dig in with your fingernails.
6165480	6167480	It's not like a loose soil.
6167480	6170480	It's like packed dirt ground, but you could get a bit...
6170480	6171480	And grab some and pull it out.
6171480	6173480	I ask again, does anyone have detect magic?
6173480	6175480	Obviously, it's a magic type thing.
6175480	6177480	Yeah, so, detect it.
6177480	6179480	I don't have detect magic.
6179480	6180480	It's been detected!
6180480	6184480	It's a fucking bag that doesn't go by bag rules!
6184480	6187480	So you reach in it and there's...
6187480	6189480	It's a magic bag!
6189480	6191480	Save a spell!
6191480	6193480	I pull out some of this dirt.
6193480	6194480	I want to hold it up.
6194480	6195480	Look at it.
6195480	6197480	It looks like dirt.
6197480	6200480	I throw it, and I spit, and I twirl.
6200480	6205480	I twirl around into the tundra, yelling about my dad.
6205480	6211480	I poke my head, confident in my knowledge of Bill Mardigan.
6211480	6214480	Bill Mardigan!
6214480	6217480	He's like the HBO guy, but different.
6217480	6218480	I poke my head.
6218480	6219480	It's going.
6219480	6221480	I poke my head in the bag.
6221480	6223480	You poke your head into the bag,
6223480	6225480	and you find yourself in a warm city,
6225480	6227480	bathed in golden glowing light.
6227480	6228480	Guys! I poke my head in the bag.
6228480	6230480	I think we found paradise in a bag.
6230480	6231480	It's in a bag!
6231480	6232480	Paradise in a bag.
6232480	6233480	Get in there!
6233480	6234480	Can we fit in there?
6234480	6235480	I thought that was okay.
6235480	6241480	If you want to find paradise, you go to Bill Mardigan's.
6241480	6244480	Let's go in, guys.
6244480	6245480	Wait, can we fit in there?
6245480	6246480	Yeah.
6246480	6247480	It's a whole city.
6247480	6250480	It's a whole beautiful city in here.
6250480	6251480	But if we go in there,
6251480	6256480	then we're in a bag that anyone in Yahoo can just find like we did.
6256480	6260480	Should we first find a place to secure this bag?
6261480	6264480	My recommendation is we dig a 3x3 hole.
6264480	6267480	We're talking in Minecraft terms.
6267480	6270480	We put it down at the bottom,
6270480	6272480	and then we all go into it.
6272480	6273480	Well, no one can...
6273480	6274480	Maybe we should put it inside.
6274480	6278480	Your whole life you've been trying to get away from holes.
6280480	6281480	I don't think...
6281480	6282480	I'm just...
6282480	6283480	That's a reprieve.
6283480	6284480	That's not my take.
6284480	6285480	Someone died.
6285480	6286480	You called back somebody that nobody remembered.
6286480	6287480	Nobody remembered.
6287480	6288480	Yeah.
6289480	6290480	I have skills at this.
6290480	6293480	One of us could wait while the rest of us went out.
6293480	6295480	I mean, this bag is sitting out in the middle.
6295480	6296480	Yeah, come on.
6296480	6297480	What's the worst they're going to do with it?
6297480	6299480	They're going to stick their hand in it,
6299480	6301480	and they're going to get in a big argument about what it is,
6301480	6303480	and either come in or they'll leave it there.
6303480	6305480	It's like a portal, probably, right?
6305480	6306480	Maybe it's a portal.
6306480	6310480	It really doesn't have anything to do with what you don't stay in the bag.
6310480	6311480	Maybe.
6311480	6312480	How do we get out of the bag then?
6312480	6313480	We have that ladder.
6313480	6317480	We should use the ladder so that we can climb back out of the bag if we need to.
6317480	6318480	The ladder of fears.
6318480	6326480	I volunteered to go into this bag and devil may care.
6326480	6328480	Why don't we send you and the bird,
6328480	6330480	because the bird can fly and fly back out of the bag.
6330480	6335480	Not to be this person, but I wanted to go in the bag a long time ago.
6335480	6336480	I want to go in the bag.
6336480	6338480	She did find the bag.
6338480	6339480	And I would like to go into it.
6339480	6343480	I've always dreamt of being the person who jumps in the bag first.
6343480	6345480	I take my foot out of the bag and go,
6345480	6348480	ooh, sorry.
6348480	6350480	And I do a like, ooh, yeah.
6350480	6353480	And I puff my chest out as much as I can.
6353480	6354480	All right.
6354480	6355480	Ladies first.
6355480	6356480	Go ahead, Mulray.
6356480	6357480	All right.
6357480	6359480	I jump into the motherfucking bag.
6359480	6360480	Head first.
6360480	6363480	Mouth open.
6363480	6364480	It seems unnecessary.
6364480	6366480	I don't know why you have to take that risk.
6366480	6367480	It does.
6367480	6368480	It does.
6368480	6369480	It does.
6369480	6371480	Always make an entrance.
6371480	6372480	I get that.
6372480	6373480	Yeah.
6373480	6374480	All right.
6374480	6376480	You dive into the bag head first.
6376480	6377480	Mouth open.
6377480	6380480	You find yourself in this warm city.
6380480	6384480	You find yourself jumping out of a similar bag into this warm city.
6384480	6388480	You hear the sounds of chirping birds and babbling brooks.
6388480	6393480	There's a small gnome sitting on a small toadstool smoking a small pipe
6393480	6396480	and fiddling with a comically large shoebuckle.
6396480	6399480	It's Bill Mardigan.
6400480	6401480	Hi.
6401480	6405480	Me and my friends, we're looking for the tarragon of virtue.
6405480	6409480	You are, you're a, you're a, you're a person.
6409480	6414480	You're a, you're a, I'm a bewilder and I also wonderland.
6414480	6415480	What's a?
6415480	6416480	Greetings.
6416480	6419480	I'm Fizzbob.
6419480	6422480	Hey, Fizzbob, what is this place?
6422480	6424480	And do you know a Bill Mardigan?
6424480	6426480	This is Bill Mardigan.
6426480	6429480	The town that's everywhere.
6429480	6433480	And it's Dollar Shrimp Shooter Nights.
6438480	6440480	Welcome.
6440480	6441480	Thank you.
6441480	6442480	Thank you.
6442480	6445480	Am I able to call up to my friends?
6445480	6446480	Yeah.
6446480	6450480	You, you jumped in here through a bag and then there's a similar bag on the
6450480	6453480	floor that you climbed up out of to get here.
6453480	6455480	So you could probably shout into it.
6455480	6456480	Hot my head out?
6456480	6457480	Yeah.
6457480	6458480	All right.
6458480	6459480	It's cool guys.
6459480	6460480	Jesus Christ.
6460480	6461480	Oh Jesus Christ.
6461480	6462480	Fuck.
6462480	6463480	Holy shit.
6463480	6466480	Don't ever, ever fucking do that again.
6466480	6468480	It's like the ending to seven.
6468480	6470480	I just shit, I shit my pants.
6470480	6472480	I just shit in my pants.
6472480	6473480	It's real warm.
6473480	6474480	God damn it.
6474480	6475480	What's in the bag?
6475480	6477480	You guys gotta come down.
6477480	6480480	Why is she so out of breath?
6480480	6481480	No.
6481480	6482480	It was awkward.
6482480	6485480	We were in the middle of her funeral.
6485480	6490480	If you go down the bag, do you come up out of the bag?
6490480	6492480	I open the bag and call down.
6492480	6497480	Is the bag that you're coming out of upside down or is it right side up?
6497480	6498480	Yeah.
6498480	6506480	I cinch it and throw it.
6507480	6510480	No I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6510480	6511480	Let's go in guys.
6511480	6513480	Let's go in the bag everybody.
6513480	6514480	All right.
6514480	6516480	Who wants to, I mean.
6516480	6517480	I go, I goes next.
6517480	6520480	I mean you're already kind of half in the bag.
6520480	6521480	Yeah.
6521480	6522480	All right.
6522480	6530480	I go, I go, I go, I go down head first, mouth open, nuts up, ass wide, ankles deep, bald
6530480	6531480	nuts.
6531480	6532480	Nuts up guys.
6532480	6534480	I got my ankles in my hand.
6534480	6536480	I'm ready.
6536480	6543480	I'm a huffing tape head cleaner to dilate my asshole as I go in.
6543480	6546480	That's a thing I learned from the gay community.
6546480	6547480	Great attitude.
6547480	6550480	It's a great open mouth nuts up attitude.
6550480	6551480	I love it.
6551480	6552480	Yeah.
6552480	6553480	I'm an advocate.
6553480	6555480	I go in this bag an advocate.
6555480	6558480	Faggot neighbor, is that you?
6558480	6559480	Faggot neighbor.
6559480	6565480	Is that what that huffing thing is called?
6565480	6568480	It's another name for poppers.
6568480	6569480	All right.
6569480	6575480	I jump in also with my whole, what my penis used to be.
6575480	6578480	That happens also.
6578480	6582480	You guys jump through into the Bill Martigans.
6582480	6584480	Soon you're, soon you're all there.
6584480	6588480	Yes, we're all there now.
6588480	6591480	So wait, this place is called Bill Martigans?
6591480	6592480	This realm?
6592480	6593480	This place?
6593480	6594480	Yes.
6594480	6595480	Are you Bill?
6595480	6596480	No, I'm Fizzbob.
6596480	6597480	All right.
6597480	6599480	I mean, how would I know that?
6599480	6600480	Fizzbob.
6600480	6601480	Fizzbob.
6601480	6602480	What is this place?
6602480	6603480	This is Bill Martigans.
6603480	6606480	The town that's everywhere.
6606480	6611480	The town that comes with a side of coleslaw and cornbread.
6611480	6613480	Is this paradise?
6613480	6614480	No.
6614480	6616480	I like to think so though.
6616480	6618480	All right, enough Fizzbob.
6618480	6621480	Don't fucking sell us on this town.
6621480	6623480	Who's Bill Martigan?
6623480	6625480	This is Bill Martigan.
6625480	6627480	That's the name of the town?
6627480	6628480	It's not a person?
6628480	6629480	No.
6629480	6630480	It might be a person.
6630480	6631480	Let's not rule that out.
6631480	6632480	I don't know.
6632480	6636480	I just know it's the town that I love so much.
6636480	6638480	What goes on here at Bill Martigan?
6638480	6640480	There's all sorts of fun.
6640480	6644480	There's smoking and riddles and horseshoes.
6644480	6645480	One of those things in order?
6645480	6646480	In that order?
6646480	6648480	It's a fudruckers.
6648480	6649480	Yeah.
6649480	6650480	Yeah.
6650480	6652480	There's a fixing bar.
6652480	6654480	A bar with all kinds of solvents.
6654480	6656480	There's smoking and riddles and horseshoes.
6656480	6657480	It's big.
6657480	6658480	Well, we should eat that.
6658480	6660480	Oh my goodness.
6660480	6664480	There's smoking and riddles and horseshoes.
6664480	6668480	This place has almost everything.
6668480	6670480	There's no...
6670480	6671480	I can only think of a couple things.
6671480	6672480	There's no medicine.
6672480	6673480	There's no education.
6673480	6674480	Yeah.
6674480	6675480	That's perfect.
6675480	6676480	Because I wanted to smoke.
6676480	6677480	He wanted to do horseshoes.
6677480	6678480	And he wanted riddles.
6678480	6681480	And we were like, we're going to have to make three stops.
6681480	6684480	We all want corn bread.
6684480	6685480	Yeah.
6685480	6686480	Bill Martigan.
6686480	6687480	I don't have a lot of time.
6687480	6688480	He doesn't have a lot of money.
6688480	6689480	Bill.
6689480	6692480	Bill Martigan.
6692480	6695480	What doesn't...
6695480	6699480	I mean, you're clearly a guy that loves living in Bill Martigan.
6699480	6701480	What doesn't this town have?
6701480	6703480	What's your main problem with Bill Martigans?
6703480	6707480	I don't have any problems with Bill Martigans.
6707480	6708480	Did you...
6708480	6710480	Oh, maybe he's not allowed to say it.
6710480	6711480	Shit.
6711480	6712480	Oh boy.
6712480	6714480	You got a little ominous there, Fizzbot.
6714480	6716480	Bill Martigans is a place without problems.
6716480	6717480	Okay.
6717480	6718480	Hey, Amy.
6718480	6719480	I buy it.
6719480	6720480	All right.
6720480	6723480	Why is there one tear running down your face right now?
6723480	6726480	That's just part of my charm.
6727480	6730480	Fizzbot, is there...
6730480	6733480	Do you sit here or do you guide people around?
6733480	6734480	Yeah.
6734480	6737480	You can't come in without answering a riddle.
6737480	6739480	Oh, snap.
6739480	6741480	I was hoping we'd get to the smoking first.
6741480	6743480	I love riddles.
6743480	6745480	As a gnome myself.
6745480	6746480	Now we are...
6746480	6747480	Sorry, sorry.
6747480	6748480	Go ahead.
6748480	6751480	We can't get in without answering a riddle,
6751480	6753480	but we already know from his sales pitch
6753480	6756480	the word will be either horseshoes or smoking.
6756480	6758480	Or more riddles.
6758480	6759480	Or riddles.
6759480	6761480	It's just riddles for more riddles.
6761480	6762480	Guys, guys, guys.
6762480	6763480	This is a terrible town.
6763480	6764480	It's in the bag.
6764480	6765480	I'm a gnome.
6765480	6766480	I'm a gnome.
6766480	6767480	I love smoking and riddles.
6767480	6769480	This is a slam dunk.
6769480	6771480	Give us your best shot there, Fizzbot.
6771480	6774480	I don't really like this one, but...
6774480	6776480	What has four and then two and then three?
6776480	6778480	I don't really like riddles.
6778480	6780480	The number 423.
6780480	6782480	Yeah, that's the actual answer.
6783480	6785480	He does a flip.
6785480	6787480	Oreo tower with X-fudge.
6787480	6788480	What?
6788480	6789480	Wait, stop.
6789480	6790480	What?
6790480	6792480	The number 423?
6792480	6795480	Yeah, it has a four, then a two, then a three.
6795480	6798480	But also, isn't that an analog for the riddle of the sphinx?
6798480	6801480	Yeah, and everyone answers that way.
6801480	6804480	My personal favorite answer is a gnome
6804480	6807480	with an engorgement potion.
6807480	6809480	Wait, what?
6809480	6810480	Penis?
6810480	6811480	Penis?
6811480	6812480	You have that?
6812480	6814480	No, it's a riddle.
6814480	6817480	I mean, you want an engorgement potion?
6817480	6819480	Yeah, I want an engorgement potion.
6819480	6821480	You should go to Bill Mardigan's.
6821480	6822480	For fucking great!
6822480	6828480	If you want a brand new dick, you go to Bill Mardigan's?
6828480	6830480	Wait, so it has four things?
6830480	6834480	Riddles, smoking, horseshoes, and replacement penises?
6834480	6839480	No, just potions of engorgement and other stuff.
6839480	6841480	We got all sorts of potions.
6841480	6842480	All right, well, let's go, guys.
6842480	6843480	Well, it's 10 o'clock.
6843480	6844480	We made it into Bill Mardigan's.
6844480	6846480	It looks like that's a cliffhanger, huh?
6846480	6847480	Yeah.
6847480	6851480	Maybe we can get like a beeper, and it'll buzz when you're ready for us.
6854480	6856480	Yeah, I don't know how to close the show.
6856480	6861480	Fizzbob, so now that we have access into Bill Mardigan's,
6861480	6863480	what lays in store, lies in store?
6863480	6865480	Lay, lies?
6865480	6867480	I mean, it's a lovely place.
6867480	6869480	All sorts of stuff lying in store.
6869480	6870480	Is there skeeball?
6870480	6871480	There's skeeball.
6871480	6872480	What's that?
6872480	6875480	When you go to Chuck E. Cheese's and they have the thingy...
6875480	6877480	It's like rolly horseshoes.
6877480	6880480	Oh, like rolly horseshoes.
6880480	6883480	That is the best description of skeeball I've ever heard.
6883480	6886480	I bet the pitch was rolly horseshoes.
6886480	6888480	Rolly horseshoes.
6888480	6892480	You like horseshoes, but you don't think it's rolly enough?
6892480	6894480	Skeeball.
6894480	6895480	Yeah.
6895480	6897480	Micro bowling, no.
6897480	6899480	Horseshoes, yeah.
6899480	6903480	Guys, looks like we walked into a nice bag,
6903480	6908480	and we're in a warm city full of whimsical creatures.
6908480	6909480	Yeah.
6909480	6911480	I don't know how else we could...
6911480	6913480	I mean, we have to still end the show.
6913480	6917480	All of your skulls burn red hot with a blinding surge of pain.
6917480	6919480	What the heck?
6919480	6921480	We were so close to being out, I can't believe...
6921480	6922480	Oh my God, ouch!
6922480	6923480	What?
6923480	6927480	You're just dizzy momentarily as this pain is just throbbing through you,
6927480	6928480	and then it recedes.
6928480	6929480	Jesus.
6929480	6930480	It recedes.
6930480	6932480	You still feel a burning in your soul.
6932480	6934480	It's the shrimp shooters.
6934480	6937480	You don't want to use the old shrimp shooters.
6937480	6941480	Wait, did it maybe disable the soul bombs?
6941480	6942480	You don't know, man.
6942480	6943480	I think that was a reminder.
6943480	6945480	It's not comfortable.
6945480	6949480	It sounds like the shot clock is ticking right now on our skull curses, our soul curses.
6949480	6952480	I think it was like when they do a fun X-Files episode,
6952480	6954480	but they felt like it was too fun,
6954480	6957480	so they end with the smoking guy looking at a car.
6957480	6960480	That is exactly perfect.
6960480	6961480	That would happen.
6961480	6963480	It was just like a fun one where a guy's too lucky,
6963480	6964480	and at the end they were smoking...
6964480	6966480	I guess that guy was made out of algae.
6966480	6967480	Yeah.
6967480	6969480	And then they were like, yeah, but for a reason.
6969480	6970480	Yeah.
6970480	6972480	They are coming.
6972480	6973480	Yeah.
6973480	6974480	Engage.
6974480	6975480	All right.
6975480	6976480	Thank you.
6977480	6980480	Have a nice Sunday.
6980480	6982480	11 to 6.
6982480	6983480	Thank you once again, everybody.
6983480	6984480	One more time.
6984480	6985480	Bitch Hurwitz.
6987480	6990480	Erin McGathey, Spencer Crittenden, Camille Nantiani.
6990480	6992480	I'm Jeff Davis.
6992480	6994480	Your mayor, of course, Dan Harmon.
6994480	6995480	Thank you, one and all.
7001480	7002480	Thank you.
