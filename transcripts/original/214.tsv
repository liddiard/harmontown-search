0	15600	There is a ghost who lives in Harman Town There is a ghost who lives in Harman Town
15600	27160	I'm very very very honored to say that Harman Town is now officially in session
27160	35440	Spencer Crittenden, everybody
35440	51880	I hope you saw his histogram today of him and his underwear in his hotel room
51880	58480	Because I have been pleasuring myself to that all afternoon
58480	64680	Let's hear from the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Herman
64680	76680	There is a ghost who lives in Harman Town There is a ghost who lives in Harman Town
77680	79680	Earned!
85680	89680	Earned every ounce of it, earned it, thank you
89680	91680	I believe you
91680	93680	I believe you
95680	97680	Thank you
98680	102680	These are some Harman star, where did he go?
102680	106680	These are some Harman star motherfuckers, is what I was going to say
106680	108680	Thank you Toronto
108680	111680	Where is Philip, the guy that ran me down the street walking here
111680	113680	Philip are you here?
113680	121680	I had dinner at a little small Italian joint in a kind of industrial under lit kind of wasteland area
121680	123680	Across the highway here
123680	127680	And a dude just came running up and slapped me on the shoulders
128680	132680	As far as I was concerned, that was the last thing that was going to happen
132680	134680	I don't think they understand
134680	137680	They're not aliens here, but they definitely don't
137680	143680	A guy Howard that was interviewing me for Vice today quoted Tom Sharpling
143680	145680	Which I'll now try to re-quote thereby
145680	148680	I'll paraphrase and fuck up his quote
148680	154680	But something akin to Toronto is New York with the upper 10% and the bottom 5% cut off
155680	160680	So it's like a middle class Valhalla
162680	165680	Which makes for terrible customer service
165680	169680	Because you guys don't have that terror, there's no King's Landing
169680	173680	There's no Lannister that will always pay his debts
173680	180680	So why would two oat farmers take less than an hour giving each other oat
181680	184680	There's a slight air of go fuck yourself
184680	189680	To the extent that you drag in a very American sense of entitlement
189680	192680	Which I didn't know I had until I came to Toronto
192680	194680	The service here is Canadian
194680	197680	All of Canadian has Canadian service
197680	203680	We're used to bring me my butter five minutes ago
203680	206680	But in Montreal it's a little more laid back
206680	208680	Maybe they're just sleepy
208680	209680	They're just pretending to be
209680	211680	Toronto, they're getting shit done
211680	214680	They're just like no, for real, go fuck yourself
214680	218680	I have it on my day planner, go fuck yourself between 11 and 3
218680	221680	I do have stuff to do, I'm fully awake
221680	225680	I'm on wheatgrass and I just flew a kite
227680	229680	I was at the hockey museum for breakfast
229680	231680	I'm doing things, I'm meeting people
231680	236680	The hockey museum breakfast is one of the best breakfasts in Ontario
236680	239680	It's just Toronto being obnoxious about how good their food is
239680	243680	They're like come to the hockey museum, it's better than anything you've ever eaten
243680	246680	They put pea meal on everything
246680	250680	They probably have good coleslaw at strip clubs here
250680	255680	I've eaten, I'm going to puke delicious food all over everyone in a second
255680	257680	If I don't it's only because
257680	259680	Oh yeah Dan was asking, Dan had a little tummy trouble
259680	262680	Does anyone have chums here, is that weird to ask the audience for chums
263680	267680	If the Harman Town audience doesn't have chums, then no audience has chums
267680	269680	Yeah there's someone out in the front
269680	270680	Second row
270680	272680	Oh someone's running
274680	276680	Oh no
284680	287680	Wow, wait, are you from America?
288680	292680	This is Canadian time, also it's in French so it's tout
294680	298680	Les tout, okay calcium and acid
298680	301680	Yeah this will get me going just fine
301680	304680	I'll do a stage dive and a wrap and we're done
308680	309680	Talk about my
309680	312680	You want to keep those on stage or hand them back to this guy
312680	314680	You stole this guy's shit
315680	319680	Sir, that's a very large order of antacid to bring to a shop
319680	322680	That's the full bottle
322680	325680	Would you care to come up and explain why you have so many
328680	330680	And here's yours
330680	332680	Hey Sharon here, take them
333680	338680	You're more honored to think that I have them with me than to have them back and be like
339680	340680	Hello
341680	342680	How are you doing?
342680	343680	Grab a mic from behind
343680	344680	Here grab one of those
344680	345680	They're wireless
345680	346680	Hey how are we doing?
346680	347680	Oh hi
347680	348680	What's your name?
348680	349680	Jeff
349680	350680	Jeff, why so many chums?
350680	352680	Probably a propensity for red wine
352680	353680	Oh so just
353680	354680	Just eat too much
354680	355680	Tannic acid
355680	357680	And fried bullshit
357680	360680	But you could, I mean you left your house with a safe
360680	364680	I mean you don't know what's going to happen during your day necessarily, right?
364680	366680	I know what's not going to happen
367680	370680	You're not going to have that much acid in your body
370680	373680	In between now and 2020
373680	377680	You're also not going to walk through a limousine like a Mentos commercial
377680	380680	And get laid afterwards
380680	381680	I just wanted to get a face
381680	384680	You're wearing jeans and a shirt
384680	387680	Was that in your pocket or did you carry that around just like a
387680	390680	No yeah I have like a cape kit with me on whenever I need to
390680	391680	A bag?
391680	392680	Satchel
392680	393680	I do, yeah
393680	394680	Okay you came with a
394680	395680	Canadian satchel
396680	401680	I'm sorry all writers in LA could move up to Canada and we'd blend right in
401680	402680	Absolutely yeah
402680	403680	The satchel guys
405680	408680	Well while you're up here, what do you do? Let's plug your album
411680	412680	Your soundcloud
412680	413680	I don't currently have one
413680	416680	But no I'm a promo producer for the Comedy Network
416680	420680	That's how you got those good seats and why you need all that antacid
420680	421680	You were speaking
421680	422680	You were speaking so but
422680	424680	The brutal Canadian TV industry
424680	426680	Where everyone's such an asshole
426680	429680	Throwing their apologies across the room at each other
431680	433680	Alright well I already forgot your name
433680	434680	I'm Jeff
434680	435680	How do you forget, right?
435680	436680	You have your own
436680	437680	Yeah
438680	439680	That's why I take it for granted
439680	440680	Jeff
440680	441680	Raining Jeff's
441680	442680	Would you agree with me on this?
442680	444680	We have the most boring name in the world don't we
444680	445680	Jeff is boring
445680	449680	For the most part but mine's a G Jeff so I get people angry at me every time they try to write it
449680	450680	So it's like oh actually
450680	451680	No you know what who cares, nevermind
451680	453680	Yeah but that's at least a little bit more interesting
453680	456680	Because that's more of the British commonwealth
456680	458680	You have the British G there, huh?
458680	462680	Jimmy Pardo once kicked me off the stage for having a G in my name
463680	464680	Jimmy Pardo?
464680	466680	Yeah, he was in town during his show
466680	468680	But he spells his name with G too
469680	470680	Jimmy Pardo?
470680	472680	It looks like Jimmy Pardo
472680	475680	I think it's so amazing how loyal you guys are to kids in the hall
475680	477680	There's still that picture of Scott Thompson doing
481680	486680	Every bar has a picture of Scott Thompson doing that old lady character on the wall
486680	488680	With the tiara and the dress
490680	491680	Oh that's your queen
493680	494680	Queen buddy
495680	497680	This is what I was getting at, someone shouted it out
498680	500680	But you guys are so friendly
501680	504680	You're like three applause breaks into that dumb joke
505680	507680	Because you're like yes we do support our local
508680	509680	We are wonderful
509680	511680	We are in the Queen Elizabeth theatre as we stand
512680	514680	And I just called her a dude
515680	516680	Is she with us?
518680	521680	She just turned 140 the other day
522680	524680	Does she have a successor?
524680	526680	Are you guys still doing the royalty thing?
526680	528680	She has a son that she is going to see to it
528680	531680	She will die before he ever gets near the throne
531680	533680	Or she won't die actually I guess would be the thing
533680	534680	She'll have him destroyed
534680	535680	Prince Charles will never
536680	540680	Prince Charles is like as old as like two kings got stuck together
540680	543680	And she's like nope crown is mine you will never get it
543680	546680	It's so confusing it's the same names as the British people
546680	548680	But you guys are
552680	553680	How are you supposed to tell
553680	555680	Wait sorry go on
556680	558680	They're Canadian queen it's like
559680	561680	She looks just like the British queen
561680	564680	And now I'm learning she has a prince the same name as the
564680	568680	English one that we still have some level of allegiance to
568680	569680	We put her on the money
569680	572680	They are a sovereign nation here in Canada
572680	574680	But they still have some weird commonwealth
574680	577680	Relationship with the governor general and stuff
577680	579680	And the lieutenant general that answers to her
579680	581680	But doesn't actually but does but doesn't
581680	584680	Gonna get corrected all sorts of times
584680	587680	Well five years ago we would have been all a judge
588680	592680	All kinds of fun to poke at how you run the things everywhere
593680	596680	Just you know that Justin Trudeau
598680	600680	The creator of Bloom County
601680	602680	Wait no I'm sorry
605680	607680	My joke is ill-informed
607680	608680	Creators deep balance
609680	611680	I have to Wikipedia my dumb joke
612680	613680	No Burke breathed
614680	615680	Anyways
617680	618680	Jeff
618680	621680	Well you don't know is that Dan before he travels to another country
621680	623680	He does intensive research
624680	626680	I went to the map and I was like oh
626680	628680	I will entertain them by saying
629680	632680	Toronto is Canada's teabag
634680	636680	Because it kind of dips into us
636680	638680	We're like the dick halo move of countries
638680	640680	When you look at the map it's the
642680	644680	It's your balls like dipping into our
645680	646680	Into our
646680	647680	Into our fresh water
647680	649680	It's a lot of land mass
650680	652680	It's their water
654680	656680	Oh my god
656680	658680	Oh my god
661680	663680	I love how sci-fi this is
663680	665680	It's our water they're yelling
665680	666680	It's our water
668680	670680	Two men enter one man leaves
672680	674680	Give the people the air
675680	677680	Let's hear it for Ann S and Jeff everybody
678680	680680	Ann S and Jeff
680680	681680	Take your
683680	686680	It's a lot of it's a lot of times Jeff
687680	689680	Wait who's sitting next to that guy
691680	694680	That was a that was a classic well this is this is white male
695680	697680	Centric thinking that was a classic
697680	698680	Torontonian
698680	701680	I'm sure that the face of the modern Toronto is
702680	705680	You know would be would be offended by me implying that with my
705680	709680	But I'm like that's a that's a Torontonian like clipart image
710680	713680	Is Jeff he was he had like a flannel shirt basically
713680	715680	But it was like modern like it was like
715680	716680	I gotta say
716680	718680	It's like a vestige like it's like a marvel
718680	721680	Marvel did like a new Toronto series
722680	725680	It's like it's like his character in the 40s was a lumberjack
725680	728680	That threw hologram axes
729680	732680	But now he's just like a dude who's got a
732680	733680	He takes selfies and
734680	737680	But he still has to incorporate the flannel into the
737680	739680	But now he runs a comedy network
741680	743680	And it's not it's not doing well in his tum tum
745680	747680	All right, we should check in with Spencer
753680	754680	No need for any of that
755680	759680	I was worried I wouldn't have anything to talk about but they're so nice
759680	762680	Just go like I like hot dogs and they're like yay
762680	764680	And it's like this shows in the bag
765680	769680	But what tell talk to us about Toronto give us some impressions
769680	770680	Oh man
771680	775680	Okay, I don't know. I got I got here. I took a lift
775680	778680	No, I took an uber over here and there's this driveway outside
778680	780680	And I wanted the guy to pull into the driveway
780680	784680	But he stopped just on the street and when he stopped just on the street
784680	786680	Someone got into the car
786680	790680	A woman and this is you know, this is a weird thing that happens
790680	795680	Sometimes you hail Ubers or sometimes someone thinks they're the uber and they're not or whatever
795680	800680	This stuff happens, but she got in the car and I was like, well, I don't think I saw his phone
800680	802680	It didn't pick anyone else up
802680	806680	I don't think you hailed anyone right in the taxi guys like no
806680	807680	No, I did not
808680	809680	And I was like, yeah
809680	813680	And then like what the woman just like I don't know she said something
813680	815680	But I couldn't really understand her
815680	818680	So it was great but she
819680	823680	And then I was like, well, did you hail an uber? Did you did you call for an uber?
823680	824680	And she's like, no
826680	830680	You said she said something like like it's fun to make friends
830680	833680	Oh when she entered the car, she opened the door and getting into the car
833680	835680	She was like, it's great to make new friends
835680	843680	Yeah, and I believe I just what we're piecing together here is like like to to to to to to put an agenda
843680	846680	Are you sure she wasn't like a sex worker?
847680	849680	I'm pretty sure I want to be your friend
849680	855680	I haven't done my research but I think it's like you cut off the top 10% of New York the bottom 5% and 95% of the guns
855680	858680	I think because otherwise why would people behave this way?
859680	867680	Like like we come from a land of high anxiety like like like where and your every conversation could be your last
867680	870680	And they're just a little more I'm gonna bound up to you
870680	878680	But is Toronto I heard from a driver coming in that Toronto like this violence is kind of on the up on the upswing here like
878680	880680	You can do it
882680	887680	Is it a traditionally though has it been renowned as a pretty crime-free place
889680	894680	This is the Niagara Falls place, right? This is the place we share Niagara Falls with half our water
894680	901680	No, I mean if you go to Niagara Falls the fun side is the Canadian side
903680	908680	Although that burger came with the big Frankenstein on top that's fucked up
909680	914680	You guys could class it up a little bit the hotels look like 70s porn hotels
915680	921680	Like put a nice hotel in Jesus the most beautiful vista in the world in the hotel is skeevy as shit
922680	927680	You could also be a little less diligent with the shot thing like the measurements of the shots
927680	935680	It doesn't if someone orders a vodka on the rocks that you you're allowed to just eyeball it
937680	939680	But maybe you've cleaned it all up
939680	945680	I mean maybe your way is that exactly is that a British Commonwealth thing because in the UK same thing you get that that dram
946680	951680	Text it's technically an everywhere thing, but it only in airports and in Toronto
952680	961680	Are they so exacting and just like uncompromising like they never let up just like how tipped you a thousand dollars
962680	970680	Like I'm buying you a chalet like will you let capitalism into your cold black communist heart and fucking over poor
971680	974680	Do you wonder I want to enslave you
975680	982680	You're working for me. Not your owner. I'm taking you from him poor a bunch. You'll make more money
983680	985680	They don't get it
985680	988680	They don't know how happy they'll be if they just go down our path
989680	994680	But also somehow there's still a load of alcoholics in Canada. How do you guys do it here?
994680	996680	Do you have to be wealthy or just drink beer?
996680	1002680	I think it's because it's just so it's so it's so it's so geometric for them
1003680	1009680	It's so they can it's more efficient. They're just like I've calculated exactly how drunk I'm going to get
1010680	1014680	I don't know I like cuz I have to do this thing. I don't want to draw attention to myself
1015680	1021680	I pointed at a after a while of going can I have a double all right a triple like like like this is silly
1021680	1025200	Triple like like like this is silly like there should be it
1025200	1032680	I should be able to tell the difference between what I ordered and the melted ice. Oh shit. Oh, well again a gentleman

1183480	1188600	That was really I did a great job didn't I I did some of my new stuff a lot of ethnic material
1189520	1192560	Kumail you were just out here doing an hour-long show. Yeah
1195200	1197200	Was anyone at that show? Oh
1200120	1207120	He's got is the Adderall flowing freely here, is that what so how you guys have this energy toss them this way
1208240	1212680	It's all it's all the pooch. It's like like socialized medicine and everyone has a DD
1214000	1219560	It's really crazy. I was doing my show and I'm a grown-up and I am a grown-up
1219560	1222960	And I found out one of my cousins was in the audience
1223600	1225960	And it really freaked me out
1226960	1230360	I'm picturing like your hot female cousin, which is played by you in a wig
1231960	1233960	Yeah, same beard
1234840	1237120	No, I'm always picturing that by the way
1238280	1243220	I'm like I'm always picturing you in a wig like when the gremlin wears a wig. Yeah
1244920	1246920	Like that but for me
1247560	1249560	chameleon
1250120	1255660	Actually Kumail sounds kind of like a female name even where I'm from come on get out
1257960	1265840	Come all is a female name and come on come on k-u-m-a-l k-a-m-a. Yeah nonsense
1267640	1269640	So racist
1270200	1272640	Can I sense we're being racist can I ask you
1272640	1281200	Yeah, like like I won't have this chance cuz I suppose do there's nobody I can't even go and make an ass of myself
1281200	1283960	But I swear this is a safe space
1284520	1286520	It's a safe space for racism
1287440	1288960	I
1288960	1295320	Swear I I know this is gonna sound like a bit and it's I know that I'm stupid and I know I'm just committing to
1295320	1299280	My Midwestern like I don't understand buddy. Just ask. Okay
1300280	1302720	My uber driver fuck you
1312400	1314400	It's perfect
1315520	1317520	Is the modern who's on first
1321960	1323080	No
1323120	1328200	Hassan first his his name is Muhammad. It's a common name Muhammad. It's great
1328320	1332120	Like there's a there's a bunch of people named Muhammad. Are you telling me or asking me?
1332600	1336920	Well, you could correct me if I'm wrong. It's not a unique name. It's not like a crazy name
1336920	1340320	It's not like it's like it's like John or something. It's like very common
1341600	1343600	Correct. I don't
1343640	1348440	When we talk about the whole like oh you made a cartoon and it's like it's like, okay
1348440	1352040	We had a thing called graven image and all this stuff and like like like I don't
1352920	1357240	Why is this why can his name be Muhammad if it's like that that actually is a good question
1357240	1363160	I wonder that too if his name is Muhammad and he is born with the exact face of Prophet Muhammad
1364200	1366200	then that's a horrible or
1368360	1371880	Or the or the face that Trey Parker and Matt Stone would have drawn
1372720	1376560	Like yes, but that's also bad. Yeah, if it's fully 2d
1377000	1381480	But I guess that's my that's the Asperger part of my question is like, how do we know that's the whole point
1381560	1383560	I thought I would think the whole point against
1385520	1392600	The the depiction thing would be you're not supposed to that's but that's not supposed to be known that's not supposed to be defiled
1393520	1395360	with like
1395360	1401800	depictions and things and mimicry and so why and then but then a human being but I guess that's the same you see in
1401800	1404760	Life's like, you know, it's like everybody named Jesus
1404760	1410220	It's like like whoa, your mom's like super Catholic, but my mom would slap me if I dropped a dish and said Jesus
1410860	1416540	Like but you name your kid Jesus, it's like but the difference is you can draw Jesus and be fine
1416660	1420220	That's true. Do you we should do you want to draw Muhammad right now?
1424540	1428480	That's an interesting point and I had never I've never thought about it
1429100	1431340	Why are people allowed to be called Muhammad?
1431340	1435020	But you then you're not allowed to draw his face and also when you're drawing his face
1435100	1441720	How do we is how do you know exactly what that guy looks like because every Muslim is brawn is born a
1442100	1446100	Priori with the knowledge of Muhammad's face in their head
1446700	1451740	And we can all compare it, but it's just someone to explain it to white people
1451740	1456980	We can't explain it. But if someone draws a picture of Muhammad, we look and we're like, that's not close enough. You're fine
1457860	1459860	But
1459860	1463140	So you're punished for being a really good character caricaturists
1463300	1465900	Yeah, you can do a caricature just don't be forte
1465900	1471660	Oh, right. Can I do I couldn't do Muhammad like right in the skateboard and like I want to surfboard in one arm
1472580	1476740	But you can only do it if his head is at least the size of his body
1477260	1481540	If the proportions are biologically accurate, you're fucked. Okay
1481980	1484700	what Walter Lance explains this and his
1485420	1491500	Do you think that kids born named Muhammad feel like an extra sense of duty to be like more
1492180	1498220	Good, I mean, it's a hell of a thing to have to live up to what if your name is Muhammad
1498220	1500220	You're you're a young Muslim
1500580	1505260	Kid and you go to Disneyland and you get a caricature and like my name is Muhammad
1506780	1509340	These are the questions that are gonna get us killed before
1510500	1512500	Before we're done the guy's like
1512940	1514940	What price
1515940	1517940	$15
1517940	1519940	$15. Yeah, it's Wow
1519940	1522780	Or is that a xenophobic thing to say these are questions are gonna get us killed
1522780	1524620	That's like that's a contributing to a syndrome
1524620	1529500	I think we've done more things that would get us killed in the show than what we're talking about. I disagree
1531020	1537620	But what am I disagree like like like nice Lutheran girls named Mary don't feel compelled to like either be a virgin or fuck
1537620	1542060	God like like they're not they don't feel any extra pressure. I don't think they're just like
1543500	1548780	That's true. And I've never talked to anybody named Jesus about whether or not they feel an extra mantle of like being
1549300	1552300	Growing out their hair or whatever wearing a lot of robes
1554260	1557100	All right, well that concludes my Islamic questions
1558820	1564900	You don't have any more that was it. Oh, I'm sorry. I have I have an unquenchable empty
1565900	1572820	Alice I'm an open book right now. I mean anything. I will tell you what you're feeling. Oh, I do have one
1572820	1576460	Yeah, great. Do you have the equivalent of a bar mitzvah? Oh
1578100	1580780	I know I'm saying you know, he was raised Muslim. He's not
1581780	1589060	Your personal private business whether you're secular or whatever, but but you were raised in a we don't have like a ceremony like that
1589060	1593300	Where you go from like being a kid to an adult that's like we don't we don't have that so good
1593300	1595300	Yeah, Christians have confirmation
1595420	1600660	Then you have to bar mitzvah. That's 13 the bat mitzvah, which I'm told is pronounced bat mitzvah
1601540	1603900	Yeah, it's bat mitzvah. It's Bruce Wayne
1607340	1611660	Later what am I leaving out at the temple Bruce Weinstein? I
1613940	1617540	Think I think wiccans have a thing when you turn when you turn 13
1617540	1622580	It's uh, it's called the twisted roots of Hades. Well, I also feel like oh, that's a fun one
1622580	1626220	I've been to one of those. I feel like women have naturally have
1626940	1632180	Men arc, which is you know, the first period that's like a very like obvious like before and after that
1632180	1634180	I don't think we celebrate enough. We should I
1636180	1638180	Was pandering a little bit but it's okay
1638580	1644300	But boys like what we don't have like an equivalent of that because most Christians don't a lot of Christians
1644300	1648740	I know don't have confirmation. I think boys need a boys to men. We did I
1649300	1651300	Think they need it's so hard
1652260	1654260	To say
1654260	1658900	Well, yeah, I mean can't like we spread it all out and I think that's about state control
1658900	1664960	I think that I think that the axis of power between fathers and sons is so it's such
1665620	1668100	Non-governmental power you guys are free to leave right now if you want
1669340	1673820	Am I I think they want us spreading it between like oh I get drunk on prom night
1673820	1679060	I wrestle with you on the kitchen floor, but not really like it doesn't end with someone being circumcised
1679060	1680460	I
1680460	1686260	Not if you do it, right? I think it isn't a capitalism like capitalism wants everyone to be babies
1686380	1688980	Yeah, it's like but that's different than state control, right?
1689620	1695620	We come from a capitalist state like it's a big ball of money that says like, you know in God
1695620	1696600	We trust on it
1696600	1701140	Like it's like it wants you sucking on that titty for your entire life
1701140	1706140	And then it wants to just tell you that being old costs money and then and then it just watches you die
1706220	1710420	And meanwhile it tells your kids. Oh, you're Millennials. You hate old people. They're like we do
1711540	1716820	And and they told the old people like oh, you know, what really matters race and then they tell the kids
1716820	1722180	You know what matter they tell the next generation, you know, what matters racism and then they tell the next generation, you know, it matters
1723340	1728220	Kind of race like like like and then and then everyone's like what's got come every 30 years
1728220	1731260	We just told that we all hate each other. It's all money
1732260	1740580	In that same vein, don't you think that capitalists like wouldn't we then have more like oh, it's your they wanted like a
1741300	1746300	Market like hallmarks and cards and yeah, exactly. They want to have like come out. Well, that's just the innocent face
1746300	1752380	That's what you're able to trace like oh that you'd think we'd have like eleven Z's and and you're turning 12 or Rama
1752780	1757940	You know like that we but sound like the creepiest uncle in the world right now
1758940	1761380	I'm in my van for a 12 or Rama
1765420	1769180	Because I think like first wet dream for a young man should be like a
1769980	1774740	Celebrate I haven't gotten a wet dream. I've never had a wet dream. I've never had a wet dream
1774740	1778300	That's right. If you did a preemptive strike if you know what I mean
1780100	1782100	Then you don't get a wet dream
1782700	1790660	But let's say I go for weeks and I don't do any preemptive strikes. I've never woken up. There's no way you've gotten weeks. I
1792860	1794860	Mean look at you. Yeah
1798700	1801140	Look at you you clearly jerk off a lot
1804100	1805620	Yeah
1805620	1808460	Like I've never I've never I've dreamt about
1808980	1814660	Sex coming and I've never come I definitely I did I did I did in my I did
1818220	1820700	Did so much just fucking jerk off all over you dude
1821860	1827020	In my sleep. I felt like I heard the guy this I am I processed that in my brain is just
1827580	1834220	Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds. I thought just yelled ogre. I picture the mountain from Game of Thrones. Oh, oh, okay
1834220	1837260	Here's a little piece of cultural. What are we getting off wet dreams?
1837580	1839380	Well, I have one in my adulthood
1839380	1840660	I can't remember what I was dreaming up
1840660	1846120	But I remember I did actually finally after years of reading about it in these textbooks and having your
1846740	1848780	Your gym teacher tell you about it
1849820	1853780	That I had I was like, holy shit. I came in my sleep. Wait, when was this? How long ago?
1853780	1859300	I was like in my 30s. You didn't do it as a kid though. No, never never ever there wasn't anything available
1859900	1865900	Like no way the minute anything could happen down there. It was my full-time job. Yeah
1866180	1873540	like I just never turned back like like one day pam dauber looked different and work in Mindy reruns and
1873940	1879260	And it was just the next day every pillow in the in my mom's apartment was a target. Yeah
1879940	1885980	There wasn't a surface. There wasn't a fabric swatch that wasn't fucking just
1886460	1892600	Just humps like like at first dry because nothing even before anything was coming out
1892600	1894600	I've I've talked about this before
1896100	1898300	Wait, come here. Come here. Have you had wet dreams?
1899660	1901660	No, I I
1902220	1904340	always did preemptive strikes and
1904900	1906620	I actually
1906620	1909500	While my cousin was here in the show right before it
1909500	1913420	I told a 10-minute long story about when I first started masturbating
1913420	1916260	And I'll tell you the part that I didn't say
1917100	1919100	Because he was here
1919420	1922500	Directors cut is is not there here
1923380	1927980	Okay, he's gone. Yeah, I know now he wants to know the part
1927980	1931960	I didn't I talked about the first time I masturbated and how I blacked out and came to
1933300	1939900	Are you staying? I I blacked out. I had my blacked out and you came to yeah
1943820	1945220	I
1945220	1951500	Close my eyes a boy and I opened them a man. Yes. I mean if you blacked out you must have come seven or eight
1952340	1954340	Okay, all right. I
1954980	1956660	literally
1956660	1961620	The part I didn't mention is that I had a very conservative Muslim upbringing
1961620	1964180	So I was like when I first came my body when I first
1964820	1970820	Masturbated my body was like like what had been waiting so long that when I came to I swear this is completely true
1970820	1972820	I found out
1973620	1977100	That I had I this is true. I had hit the ceiling
1985900	1987900	I swear
1995620	2000060	I woke up and I saw my Muslim repression dripping from the ceiling
2001060	2003060	Wait, how I
2003500	2006740	Swear and I thought it was gonna be that's maybe five feet
2007340	2009820	Right. Are you being racist about the height of?
2010420	2013540	Pakistani ceiling everyone knows you people sleep on the floor
2016380	2021060	If the average ceiling is eight feet, I'm pushing the average size ceilings in a
2022340	2027300	Because he's in the bathroom this part I know so you should've got a toilet. That's so I'm even lower dude
2027300	2029940	I'm hitting the ceiling from this height. Okay
2032300	2038260	It's my I swear I just I swear I had I remember I had to stand on top of the toilet to like
2039220	2044260	Wipe it. How how old were you? I was probably like 11
2044860	2047660	And I thought that I was like, this is how it always is
2047660	2054340	I would like do it. I would like close my eyes and look away, but I have never been able to replicate the results
2055300	2058180	It dribbles out like a little bit why I find that
2062260	2066980	I find that incredibly remarkable. Listen, so did I
2068220	2071180	Why do you think it is that men like what is it?
2071180	2073720	I guess it I guess the answers in the question
2073720	2078840	I don't know you like why like why would we want to there's ads for pills you can take that make you
2079480	2086320	Like like there make there be more making gush volume like like we like like we want it's enough
2086320	2090960	So it's over the size thing. It's like that. It actually doesn't really make any sense logically
2090960	2096680	But it's like it just is what it is. But it's like funny that we also are like plus you wanna everybody wants to
2098720	2102100	Speaking for women for those men who are fucking women we don't want that
2104520	2106520	Looking for geysers
2107240	2112400	But I think that women are so good at well this I don't want to say I don't want to I don't want to say
2112400	2114400	Women are good at anything. But but like
2115000	2119840	Wow, that came out wrong. No, that is so
2121200	2123200	Feminist mr. Trump my next question
2124360	2129880	That is truly so feminist of you. I'm such a feminist. I don't want to say women are good at anything
2129880	2133560	And thank you Dan. Thank you. Thank you for that. There's a fine line
2133560	2136880	Finally somebody has the courage. I'm a master of all worlds
2136880	2140960	I meant I didn't want to make a sweeping statement about women, but I was just gonna say
2141320	2144240	Like women are so good and men are so fragile
2144240	2149180	Like women are so good at like like kind of intuitive note. That's sexist intuiting
2150000	2156560	Wait, I think that men think I think that all men have experienced like maybe a woman saying like oh, wow
2156560	2158560	That's a lot
2158640	2163080	And like and like spinning it like and we've been like oh, that's good, huh?
2164000	2166000	Like I feel like it must yeah
2166000	2168960	I feel like when I feel like when it's not a lot because maybe you have
2169440	2172880	What did you call it Camille when you've dribbles out like a broken water?
2175080	2178080	Preemptive strike a lot of preemptive pre-emptive strikes. Yeah, I
2178800	2185640	Always felt that there was a you know, you can actually get pregnant with the preemptive strike. Yes, sir. There is some empty strike
2187040	2188440	Arguably more
2188520	2196360	I read a thing that says like you you you're because you're what you're doing is you're you're getting rid of overstock.com
2198680	2202760	Though so if you if you like have one of those special days
2203720	2207160	when you're like, you don't have any phone calls till 2 and
2208280	2210680	You're just you just you know
2212440	2215320	Like you're arguably more fertile. I don't I thought I read something
2215320	2220320	It feels weird to be talking about this and have Emily be like two feet lower than us
2221920	2223920	It's tough to be a lady guys
2225120	2227120	Wait, I'll say this when I was a
2227720	2233400	Younger woman. I thought that a lot meant that I was really think they were really like into me
2233560	2239360	Right, and then now I realize that they just they just haven't masturbated that recently
2240200	2242200	That's
2242200	2247200	A million like variables, but do you think that you got that impression from men?
2247200	2253520	Like do you think that a guy no, I just feel like nobody ever like no guy was ever like that's for you young lady
2253520	2258480	Like it wasn't but I did like I did think like a little extra in there for you. Yeah
2259520	2261520	Get yourself something else
2262760	2266940	Like a like a like a replica of yourself that's half me
2269600	2274880	Don't spread it all in one place a guy never it never made me feel that way, but I was like
2275560	2278040	For me all this like I didn't have that
2282800	2284800	All this that that
2285360	2292840	Actually makes sense. Yeah, you feeling a weird amount of pride about the amount of and now I just realized it's meant that you've had
2292840	2294840	phone calls all day
2299360	2301360	Joe
2301920	2305200	The the the okay, so a
2305800	2310340	If you if you're with a guy and he is a geyser, that's just a dude that has no phone calls
2311280	2313280	It could be a guy
2315000	2319480	Very busy man. Yeah, it could be a guy that's very excited about about you
2320640	2324880	Excited that really doesn't know if you just jerked off three times before she came over. It doesn't matter
2325120	2329520	You're still not gonna you're not gonna make a bunch of yeah, there's variables. It's always things
2329520	2335060	I don't want anyone listening to this to I don't I don't know what they're having. I don't want anyone listening to this
2337320	2343840	Probably much water you've had to sorry. Yeah, it's funny. It'll we'll find out in the year 2030 that it's like it's Skittles
2345440	2347440	You know
2347480	2350040	I was at a bar. I was at a bar and that
2350360	2357920	Suspend your disbelief for that's I was at a bar and I ordered tequila with it with pineapple juice and the the bar center
2357920	2359920	The gal goes uh-huh
2360280	2366680	All right. Yeah that thing. Yeah, and now every time you order pineapple juice they think that you're trying to make your sperm taste good
2366680	2371240	Exactly. Yeah, I was I was in a also at a bar
2372400	2373560	and
2373560	2375560	as I was walking out a
2376440	2378440	Person kept yelling something and I
2378960	2383960	It started with an H and it was it was it was not quite my name
2384640	2390860	And and it was like it just but it just was so insistent and it kept getting yelled that finally decided like like I'll look
2390960	2396600	Back over my shoulder as I was turning I realized and my eyes landed on the guy
2397120	2400640	That my brain caught up and realized he was yelling Hodor
2400920	2402920	And
2403160	2405320	Then he was very much directing it at me
2407920	2413680	And then I looked at him and and and was he being chased by a lot of white walkers
2414600	2417560	He he I mean I've never I have an experience
2417560	2423460	I was like I was like really taking it back like I'm not I'm not a thin-skinned person like it's it's about intent
2423480	2427720	It's when you realize someone's really like it's like wait, what's going on?
2427880	2429840	Like it's not like oh, no
2429840	2434360	I look like Hodor that guy's handsome like like but but it was like it was like holy shit
2434360	2439280	That's like like like this guy because I was waiting I turned and looked and and he just had this
2439560	2441960	This delighted grin on his face
2442000	2444440	He was like like but he was a 30 year old man
2444440	2449600	And he just and in a sweater and he just like once I was looking at him. He just smiled and went Hodor
2452320	2454320	Maybe he was Hodor and
2454320	2461320	Yeah, and he was saying he was really saying Paul Run! Paul Run! Paul Run!
2464920	2467240	Is that you? It's like the gift of the Magi
2468360	2473880	Yeah, but he I mean he just and I I was like still I just kept staring at him and he was like Hodor
2474560	2480440	And his friends were all looking at him like like like like have you had luck contacting Hodor?
2480520	2486400	Like like like I just it was the whole thing was so sociopathic like I I and I kind of like cuz I waited
2486400	2492160	I was like well, maybe maybe now he'll say just kidding. I love harm in town. I'll see you at the show. I
2493880	2499160	I guess that's silly of me to expect but I didn't expect it as much as I really needed it in that moment and
2499880	2502720	I so I just waited and it was like Hodor
2503680	2507180	And I and I just slowly raised a thumb. I was like
2508020	2509620	And
2509620	2515940	Then turned around and I was like like if I did this in Los Angeles this person would feel bad
2516700	2518700	That's the dark side of Toronto
2519380	2526580	Do you think he actually thought you were Hodor? It could be because you asshole it could be no, I'm kidding
2527060	2532820	No, I mean people recognize you as the wrong. I mean people recognize people as the wrong celebrities that definitely happens
2532820	2535980	I legitimately look enough like Hodor that the guy could have thought I was Hodor
2535980	2541100	But but when you look back on it, like there's enough of a chance that I'm not Hodor that that guy should not be doing
2541100	2545620	That right. Yeah, but you're but you're like a white guy
2545620	2546460	So it's okay
2546460	2552620	Like I remember once I was at an airport and NBA player Chauncey Billups was there and I was like
2552620	2557500	I can't go up to Chauncey Billups and be like you play in the NBA, right? Like I can't go up
2557500	2559500	And if it's just another black guy
2560500	2565260	That's the worst thing I could have done. How do you think I felt you play in the NBA?
2568140	2571940	Imagine imagine my anxiety the second time I got Muhammad today
2571940	2576800	Like like I like like when I called the uber I was like wait, how can it be him? I ordered an SUV
2576800	2579940	I'm racist and it was a different different mom. No, it was the same dude
2579940	2583460	He fucking like fucked up like these people do not have not these people
2586300	2588760	That's been our show coming everybody
2590500	2591740	Ontarians
2591740	2593820	Go ahead. What did these people?
2594700	2599940	Not under tell us tell us what they're like. They do not have uber down in in Toronto
2599940	2604340	Oh, you know what? You should report it at the police. I'll be a sketch artist
2605940	2609860	What did he look like here draw him it's not Muhammad that's done me wrong
2610900	2614600	Muhammad's okay and for the love of God don't draw him
2615100	2617100	the the the
2617340	2619340	I know that was a joke the
2619740	2624680	Thought I'd get away with stealing it. I don't know the the it they're uber
2625100	2631660	They're they're not they're not taking to uber like a fish to water in Toronto. They're not having you guys have they're figuring it out
2633940	2639700	It's a lot of like like like though you'll watch the car just like twirl yeah, and then
2640980	2643660	And then you'll get a phone call and you'll be like, are you okay?
2644620	2646620	He's just
2646620	2653820	Tell you where they are and you'll walk to them for 10 minutes in your head. They're like tumbling. They had a horrible accident
2653820	2657500	Yeah, looks like you're seeing it. Are you all right, mom? Are you okay?
2658580	2662500	No, when I was in Paris in Paris the uber is there I don't like uber
2662500	2666260	I use lift cuz lift is in a West Coast thing. You guys don't have it here. Do you?
2667340	2672780	You do need it cuz uber uber blow ho-hose. It's it's the worst but in Paris. It's great
2672780	2675420	It's all a bunch of really like awesome Moroccan dudes
2675420	2680460	And they drive like groovy cars and they're super like super hip and fun
2680460	2685480	And they're like like that's it's the best so you've had a good experience with you only in Paris
2685480	2689580	I don't know in Toronto the uber is here up in wild yeah
2689580	2694780	I watch you you look at the app and you just see a little icon of a car just doing little pirouettes just
2695700	2700700	And they have a lot of one-way streets here. So it's like it's it's not I wasn't on my street
2700700	2704500	So but he kept making it like I know but it's like it's the and also then you add the it's crazy
2704500	2706820	Cuz you just see like it looks like a little kid
2706820	2711380	It has a magnet behind a whiteboard. It's just like dragging the car around Toronto
2711380	2716420	I don't know what something something's got to give hey, what is on your what is on your Apple?
2716420	2718540	I watch Toronto facts Toronto facts

2729060	2731220	Sidekick to the La Rone reranger
2741580	2743580	That is a great
2752860	2755740	Joke once a week until the day I die
2755740	2764140	I'm not joking. There is no more did you do did you know someone got murdered here that?
2765060	2769740	This I don't know what kind of I don't know what kind of hot buttons. I'm doing I just will sing it like the chiron

2772460	2780500	Inuit population here and an artist who's that what's the last name of the artist that just is they're investigating the murder or something
2780700	2785100	Wait, you guys should know your news. That was not what wait what wait what?
2785740	2793020	From what you said there's an Inuit population and somebody got murdered and an artist is in charge of the investigation
2793020	2793580	No, sorry
2793580	2794300	I
2794300	2798420	Fell apart because I started to get scared like I don't know the local like hot button stuff

2804300	2809900	I just I just like my eyes was like why I was drinking in the barn to the TV like their news crawl

2824420	2828300	Yeah, that was a person. Yeah, it's a human being whose life is
2829820	2833660	And there's probably also cultural fucking ramifications off of what I'm doing
2833660	2839780	I'm probably trampling all over horrible ghosts of abuse. I really don't know what you're talking about
2839780	2845220	They have a funny name a funny name. Their name is funny to me because I'm white. I think everything's funny

3050100	3055460	Well, she's leaving more for you and she's being very self-effacing and uh a new
3056180	3062500	She's putting herself at risk. What's the goal for the instagram account? I'm like, what's the like, uh, what's the idea behind it?
3063380	3066900	I'm gonna get in so much trouble. My friends are gonna be so mad at me. Um, I started yeah
3066900	3068900	You don't want the word to get out
3070500	3072340	No, no, no, I
3072340	3077380	Make sure you find it. You promoted our shit. Make sure you eat to them like on stage
3078020	3082760	Wait vegan girlfriend. Yeah, that's me. Yeah. Oh you have 23,000 followers
3086980	3090980	Hey, you have 23,000 and one father, thank you
3093300	3095700	He is going to follow you later. I promise
3096820	3100500	uh, there's no there's no like real goal to it. I started it as like a
3101620	3103620	fun thing to do and
3103780	3106580	Now we now ariana grande follows us and that's
3109140	3112340	Does she lick your donuts that's a reference to it
3112340	3114340	Whoa, whoa, whoa
3114980	3120900	Granny lick lick lick like crawlers or she was at a store and she while the people weren't looking she licked the donuts
3120900	3124420	And they said this is why america sucks so much. It's because we have so many donuts
3125060	3128900	Right. It's like she's in a donut store. All right. Well, whatever. She's a child. Why am I shaming her for?
3129780	3132820	For for for living a life in captivity. She's on camera
3134340	3137380	Should be more of an outrage that she's on security cam licking donuts
3138020	3140740	She should be able to get away with licking a donut, but she's also a grown-up
3140820	3143060	I think you forget that because she's very tiny but she's like
3144020	3144740	What do you look like?
3144740	3150420	Most pop stars are like adele's age, which is crazy because adele seems like a grown-ass lady and a lot of these girls
3150500	3153540	Don't but they're all grown-ass ladies, but fifties the new 30s
3154100	3157860	She's 24. I think 24 is the new weapon. I think adele's like 25
3158500	3163380	It's crazy. Oh adele's 25. Oh, fuck ariana grande. Yeah. Okay. All right. I see what you're saying
3164020	3166020	Okay
3166580	3169460	That's the age when dementia kicks in and you start licking donuts
3170740	3175060	It tastes good. I will say if i'm going to a donut shop and there's one that was
3176100	3180420	Licked by ariana grande. Yes, I would pay like double for it
3182500	3184820	Would you eat it or would you just yes, okay
3186660	3192420	Slowly and sensuously you think her saliva tastes better than other justy kids or
3193940	3197140	Disney grown ladies. That's a very difficult question
3197540	3201780	To answer without the necessary research. Yeah, i'd have to do research
3202820	3206740	Uh ari uh are you going to have to get shot in the booth in there, you know
3207380	3210440	Um, so you your friend megan and your friend alexandra

3445860	3448260	But you're saying with all these improv, uh
3449300	3454660	Roots here. We should probably get some information from ranya and then do a hilarious, uh improvised
3458020	3464340	Sketch of some kind I actually think in the event that emily gordon never has a bazinga you have to do your dance, right?
3464340	3465700	Okay

3491220	3493220	Most of europe you can get the name, aren't you?
3494900	3500020	All right, so raised in ireland. Yeah, my parents are from there. Uh, both parents are irish. Yeah. Yeah
3500180	3502180	So they just had you in canada and then?
3504420	3508020	They had like a house in ireland and they brought me there and then they came back
3508500	3510900	Do you speak irish? I don't speak irish. I'm sorry
3511540	3513540	That's not a language
3516980	3520580	Like they force it they have these things called gail talks which is like you go there
3520980	3526420	It's like like a confined space where you go just to speak gaelic and you can't speak english. This is your parents
3526660	3529700	No, well, this is I have an instagram called vegan gail talk
3533460	3536820	Gail friends can you believe this is like
3539540	3544340	Dad you fixed it vegan girlfriend. Yeah, I plussed it. He's always pleasant my shit
3546020	3549860	I plussed it. I plussed it. You plussed it. Uh, yeah vegan girlfriends. Yeah
3550660	3552660	Well, you just you just minused our friendship
3555780	3560580	Uh, all right, so you're raised in ireland. They have a house there. Why how do you end up back in canada?
3560980	3566020	Um, we've got it's really not exciting. We just came back to canada. We're gonna make it exciting. Thank you
3566900	3568900	uh, we came back to canada and then I
3569540	3571060	moved to toronto, um
3571060	3577060	Because I was I was vegan and I wanted to be vegan in a place where I was raised in a menonite town like in canada
3577460	3579460	Um called el myra if anybody knows that
3581380	3583460	Um, and uh, I
3585540	3588100	What's the place called it's called el myra it's like
3591060	3593780	Wait, did you just say el myra?
3595460	3597460	Sorry, couldn't hurt
3597780	3604340	You know what the word for cupboard is this is true for the word for cupboard cupboard al myra
3605220	3607220	Boo
3607220	3609220	But it really is I'm sorry, I was saying
3612820	3619140	And all right, so I wanted to be uh, I wanted to be a comedian and a vegan at the same time
3619540	3622180	That's really hard. The only point to do that is toronto
3622820	3625620	You need like meat protein to be on stage
3627620	3629620	I'm gonna die now
3630580	3636100	Um, yeah, I feel like the veganism is a point that you really want to be pushed in the movie
3636740	3638740	Like you want to make sure that's included
3639140	3644980	It is why I moved out of like the menonite capital of like canada. That's probably wrong and but you know
3645460	3648420	All right. Thank you. What was a metanite? I was afraid to sound stupid
3649460	3652740	What is a metanite? Thank you, sir. I'm blaming it all
3653620	3655620	Mennonite talks the wrong way
3656500	3659300	I need a I need a menonomic device
3660980	3662980	Yeah to remember what a mennonite is
3664420	3666900	This is the second time I've heard I've mentioned in canada
3669380	3675300	Someone mentioned mennonites to me in banff and I nodded it felt charged it felt like there was something going on
3675300	3676980	I was like, okay
3676980	3678980	It's like the amish. Yeah
3678980	3684180	If you know what an amish is, you know what a mennonite is, but it's like it's like the pennsylvania dutch kind of like a quaker like yeah
3684420	3687860	Like a like a like a like a like a like a
3691060	3692660	Yeah, yeah like diet
3692660	3697540	What do you mean diet mennonite some dude yelled out diet mennonite and he was like, hey, yeah, exactly
3698980	3701060	What is what do you mean? He's like a lapsed catholic
3701060	3705540	I just I just assumed that he meant like amish is like a diet mennonite because you guys are more hardcore
3705700	3707860	I don't think amish is a diet anything
3708500	3712340	I think they're the worst. Well, you haven't met a mennonite then I I mean I have now
3712980	3714980	I'm not a mennonite. You're a diet mennonite
3715540	3717540	All right, who's up first?
3718100	3720820	All right, I think well, let's thank aunty for volunteering or
3721940	3724020	Life to us aunty everybody
3724660	3728820	You should probably aunty go and have a seat and watch your biopic

4451780	4454340	Puts forth and you're dying how to do a one-inch punch
4456340	4460260	Or the one-inch punch that I used to have a little flip book when I was a kid of bruce lee
4460660	4463300	Doing nunchucks and I would like try and train
4463860	4467780	I'd watch the flip book. Yeah, and then try and train myself to do it. That's
4468340	4472900	Amazing. I did see it. You're like you flip and then you start you're trying to do it in one hand
4472980	4477140	You're like, yeah, I'd have to pause it. It's very hard to do a flip book with one hand
4478420	4480820	That's exactly what you would do though. It's a good technique
4481940	4486020	Did you ever try breakdancing like uh by watching like break in two or something?
4486100	4489860	And then like rewinding on the vcr and then trying to like doing the slow-mo of it
4490340	4495940	Never worked. My brother and I spent like hours just trying to we're like we're gonna just like learn to breakdance and we never do
4496980	4498980	Uh, can we see a little more of it?
4500660	4502660	What do you mean it never worked
4503940	4507560	This is the podcast right popping and locking. Oh my god
4512740	4514740	Holy shit
4520500	4522600	I'm so glad kori. Thelma could be here tonight
4536980	4538980	That was amazing
4539060	4544180	Very good, it's probably it's probably good that little kids uh, they they
4544900	4549060	I saw a thing that said when you go through puberty little boys like the uh
4550420	4553300	The sexual and the violent parts of their brains start to
4554100	4556500	All this is original. Yeah, they're all like in a lot
4556580	4562580	They're gonna start to light up like crazy at the same time and they kind of like draw the animal stuff the sex and the violence
4562660	4564660	Yes, but who do you think's doing the research?
4564900	4567940	I know I know I know it seems it's such a weird pop-size thing to
4569540	4574100	But like if that were true if they're like little boys like we're prone to
4574900	4579300	like hit things with their fire truck toy and like and and
4580340	4585460	You couldn't think of a healthier way to collect and redirect that than martial arts
4586100	4589460	Like kind of classes like because you would go like okay
4589460	4594180	Yeah, you have to like if you really concentrate and go to bed when we tell you to
4594660	4598580	You'll be able to kick the world's ass, but you have to wait for the world to attack you
4599620	4606340	And it's like okay. Now it's your problem. Yeah, like next generation like when this guy's 30 he'll be ted bundy, but fuck it
4606820	4611300	Uh, he's just like going to bed every night with like a poster of a naked man above it
4611380	4614660	And he's just push doing push-ups like one day i'll beat up everyone
4615540	4620660	But everyone has to attack me first. Yeah, and then maybe it'll be the way they talk to me at the grocery store
4620660	4622660	But they'll attack me
4623060	4625060	Uh
4625540	4626660	The
4626660	4629060	Can I say something when I did my show here earlier tonight?
4629140	4634420	I saw this beautiful theater and I was like, how is harmontown gonna?
4635060	4637620	Feel like harmontown in this space
4638340	4640340	And you guys did a great job
4642420	4644420	It felt like a harmontown

4650260	4654180	Yeah, they're usually much closer. It makes me want to meet more of them. Like I want to kind of like
4656100	4662260	Do you think is this is this me pimping you guys too much or emily if I like like because you were at one point
4662420	4663060	you
4663060	4665060	You had a therapeutic career
4665700	4672180	You've written many like things about like, uh relationships and things. Can we bring up a couple and like ooh
4672660	4674660	And and and get to know them maybe
4674980	4676980	We're gonna watch them have sex or
4677860	4679300	No, it's like
4679300	4682340	Maybe they have an issue that they're trying to deal with. Well, that's a fun
4682900	4688260	I I find that often people don't volunteer for things like this, but let's see what happens. Oh, haven't you been to my show?
4689700	4695540	There's a there's a couple right there the couple they raise their hands, but also their friends are pointing like these guys

4737940	4739940	Go ahead eat it, right
4741060	4746020	I would say put it in the holder and that way you guys have a natural like give and take where you have to like
4746100	4750660	Lean in and like you you have that visual cue of like i'm gonna talk. No, i'm gonna talk. Fuck you
4751700	4756980	Um, so your names are again. My name is colin lauren colin and lauren
4757700	4759060	All right
4759060	4760660	So what's the problem?
4760660	4762020	Um, I guess
4762020	4764100	Well, we've been living together for the last little bit
4764180	4766900	But i'm broke and i'm gonna have to move back in with my parents
4766980	4772900	So we're gonna be splitting up that way but not all together, but yeah, so we're not gonna be seeing each other as much
4772980	4775060	I mean you guys have been living together. Yes
4775780	4780260	To be fair. We've been living together pretty much since we've known each other. How long have you been together?
4780660	4782660	Um about a year now actually
4782900	4786580	Okay, not too. Not too. So you kind of moved in almost immediately
4787220	4790420	Oh, okay. Yeah, I moved in immediately immediately
4792180	4793780	Well
4793780	4798340	And you consumed his now he has to leave but wait, how would
4799540	4805700	What happened? How did that happen that show game like you move you moved in and now he has to go move his parents
4805700	4807700	And you're keeping me apart
4808260	4812980	Because somebody's paying rent it sounds like you got you got a job this was an active year for you
4813460	4815460	Are you staying in his new in his place?
4815780	4819700	Um, he's moving in. Oh, no, i'm not staying in his place. You're moving out of that place
4819700	4822980	Okay, technically I have my own house. I just never go
4824900	4826420	All right, take it easy
4826420	4828500	Like you guys came with like seven friends and they're
4829140	4831860	Like they're they're up here. That's enough. All right, so lauren
4833060	4834820	Lauren you moved in
4834820	4836900	You moved into colin's crib. Yeah
4837620	4839220	About a year ago
4839220	4842500	And then colin's you you you've fallen on hard times
4843060	4845060	And you got to move back in with the family. Yes
4845380	4850180	Now lauren, where are you headed now? I have to go to my apartment. Well my house. I'm very
4851540	4855300	Yeah, i'm very disappointed. Why can't colin live into your fucking house?
4858660	4860660	He supported you for a year
4863620	4866020	Well, let me ask first what what's been the rent situation
4866020	4870580	What's been the who pays the rent and the house that you guys have been in you have been paying
4870660	4873620	So i've been paying the rent. I do have a roommate. He's with me in the front row as well
4873780	4878740	But yes, i've been paying the rent so you haven't been paying the rent. You've been paying the rent at your place. Yes
4879540	4880580	Okay
4880580	4885140	All right. So you you weren't living with him because you needed to you just were spending all your time
4885860	4888900	Unusual you guys want to be the whole time you had you've been paying rent on your house
4889220	4892660	Yeah, okay. Gotcha. What is your issue with having him move in with you?
4892740	4897780	He's kind of supported you in some some fashion. So what's the issue with having him move in?
4898100	4902580	Um, it's it's not as much him as like my situation
4903380	4905380	What are you?
4906660	4908660	Why are you being so vague?
4910260	4916020	By the way the trick to being a therapist is just ask the most obvious questions. Uh, so what is your situation?
4916980	4922180	Um, i'm new to town and I moved in with people from my residence at university
4923060	4926260	Also, you have a bunch of roommates. Oh a ton of roommates. Okay
4927140	4929140	Yeah, and you don't you're not a fan
4931460	4936260	Neither of you are fans or just i'm calling. Yeah, neither of us are fans. May I ask are you two?
4936500	4938500	Would you consider yourselves in love?
4939460	4941460	Very much though. Yes
4945620	4947620	Perfect
4949460	4951780	You don't want that to be answered at the same time
4951940	4957300	Yes, you want one person to say it I saw no person in a white hot panic to repeat it
4959380	4962580	I saw a bit of a provocation on you guys are young. Yeah
4962980	4967700	Well, that's I mean I will say that's a good time being young like look I i've I've
4968320	4974020	Cohabitated with like a thousand people and it's always been the path of least resistance the logical thing to do
4974180	4980580	So if there are a couple of little riddler question marks on their labyrinth like map what the fucking metaphor
4981220	4983220	What is that?
4983220	4985220	I just I just sprayed my neck on that one
4985620	4986180	I don't
4986180	4991220	It's it's probably all good and well for us to have a couple head scratches when we hear the situation
4991620	4996340	Because they're at a time in their lives when maybe they shouldn't have this shit all figured out like they so
4996740	4999220	It sounds like you had a hundred percent control
4999860	5003780	When it was his apartment, but you always had your own place to go back
5003780	5008260	She could always if they had a fight if he turned out to be like own a collection of human teeth
5008340	5013700	Like like she could she could just if he was if he if he like like enduring lovemaking cried out
5013700	5015700	I'm actually from montreal
5016660	5018660	Like like like she could quietly slip out
5021220	5023380	But but but there's you won't have that anymore
5023380	5025460	But not only is it more real
5025460	5031860	But also it's probably not even possible because it sounds like your living situation is more of a like a burning man kind of tent
5032100	5033700	I
5033700	5038260	And I would say that you're curiously committed to though. Like you have like a year contract at like a
5039140	5040980	hostile now
5040980	5042980	Now lauren, what is the uh
5043460	5048980	Or either of you. What do you think this the uh, the next step is like what colin you're moving into a new place
5049060	5052980	So you're you're you're searching for new place moving back with my parents. Where are your parents?
5053060	5057860	Um, my parents, um, we're not from Toronto. We're peter burrow, which is two hours north. They're in peter burrow as well
5058820	5060820	peter burrow
5061540	5064020	So you guys I have family in peter peter burrow
5064100	5068500	Is that what it's called? You do peter burrow. So you guys are going to be two hours apart now
5068820	5074340	No, we'll just be like I don't know 10 minute drive. Wait, but how where the fuck do you live in?
5074900	5077380	Oh, I live in peter burrow too. I moved there for school
5080340	5083940	All right, okay, so you guys would be like go ahead emily you're the pro here
5084100	5090420	I I'm so confused emily you have you're you have a degree in this one fucking take over. I have a degree in peter's burrow
5090820	5092820	Uh, whichever one hates. Uh
5093220	5097140	I think I and there's a term called sliding not deciding which is like
5097620	5103940	When people end up couples end up moving in together more out of necessity and like they need cheap rent more than because they've decided
5104020	5108660	like I would like to spend all my time and have all my stuff paired with yours and those
5109040	5111940	relationships end up splitting often because you don't feel like you're
5112580	5117780	Choosing to move in with someone you love you feel like this is all we can do right now because we're broke as shit
5118260	5120500	And I think you just described three quarters of my
5124660	5131060	Exactly and I just say wait i've done that with several, uh, not not you love I decided
5134420	5138580	And also you moved in with me and showed up with two two uh grocery bags
5138580	5141060	I was like i'm moving in and I was like i've made a huge mistake
5141540	5146100	That's pretty much what happened. They were not grocery bags. They were garbage bags
5148660	5155460	I couldn't fit everything I own into two grocery bags. Don't be crazy garbage bags. Sure
5155860	5159380	So I think you guys need to like, um, I think the obvious like
5160180	5162820	It doesn't sound like your living situation is stable
5162820	5167780	but I think maybe you need to work on your ideas of like do you fully committing to this would be
5169700	5172340	The next level would be you guys moving into a place
5172420	5176100	It's just the two of you perhaps if you want it and maybe it's not time for that now
5176340	5179860	But if that's a goal, maybe that all you can agree on now is that that's the goal
5180820	5185460	And then you go to your parents house. You go to your fucking burning man and you guys make out
5186740	5191540	Yeah, you guys are gonna it's there's a terror to i've been on those relationships where i'm like, oh man
5191620	5193620	If we if we make this
5194180	5196180	If we go backward, yes
5196180	5198180	Uh, it's going to be a disaster
5198900	5204260	I'm not saying that means it's going to be I am saying if that were
5204800	5206260	possible
5206260	5208260	It then what's the point?
5209060	5214660	It's it and you will find I think that that that it will it will romanticize everything
5214660	5217780	You'll be like you'll be brushing your teeth again before you know it
5218260	5223380	Like yeah, we'll go back to dating. Yeah, you'll be dating you'll it'll it'll it'll it'll happen
5223460	5225460	And it doesn't matter if it goes good or goes bad
5225540	5229540	It's not about bring the magic back and all the spices like like let's let's you know all that stuff
5229620	5231620	It's just like yeah, you guys are
5231780	5234980	Children and uh, you can you'll sustain this
5235460	5241060	Uh, yeah, I guess my biggest concern is i've i've made steps to becoming an adult a millennial adult and what have you done?
5242740	5244740	401k
5244900	5250340	She moved out of his parents and I yeah, and I work at a bong shop. So those are two adults
5250660	5254420	That's your individual. Yeah. Well, I mean, yeah, so you do have a job. Yes. Yes
5254420	5258820	I yeah, but you just your job doesn't provide you enough to get your own place. Exactly. Yes
5259060	5260420	Yes
5260420	5262180	What?
5262180	5263860	It does. Yes. Sure
5263860	5269060	There's a room full of people here that will forgive you for for having to take backward steps in terms of that
5269140	5269540	Yeah
5269540	5275300	The myth of you turning 18 leaving your parents place and becoming a human being that creates other human beings
5275380	5280100	That's all that's all steeped in at time before they figured out how to really tap the workforce and exploit them
5280100	5281460	So if you bet
5281460	5282420	That's absolutely true
5282420	5287540	Your generation now has seven jobs and like like they've it's what the market will bear you
5287700	5291140	You i'm sure that's no different in any country you go to it's like oh
5291220	5294740	They can all work and they can all fuck the fuck off and be children until they're 80
5295060	5299220	Like they're they'll there's no shame in living with your parents till you're 70
5299860	5302500	Uh, but you want some shame in that
5306020	5308020	But I think as long as you're striving to like
5308340	5313780	Whatever your the next thing is you want to do if it's a better bong shop where you get paid more
5314020	5318020	That's a thing. I mean I you gotta start your own bomb shop, bro
5319700	5323620	Yeah, we're looking at legalization 2017 in canada. So, you know, we're amazing
5324340	5327460	So then those bonds will they'll be worthless exactly
5328020	5334100	Do you think that the vape culture has hurt the bong culture a hundred percent? No, jeff. I will fight that to a t
5334660	5336660	I I didn't have an opinion. I was just
5338420	5341540	I get paid to have an opinion. I wasn't going fucking hillary on you
5341540	5343540	But
5343540	5345540	Uh, well, where are you guys on cratum?
5346020	5351140	Oh speaking of which actually I sell cratum at my shop not for human consumption, of course
5351380	5355140	But no, I have a lot of customers who would seriously helps with their with their addictions
5355140	5359940	Methadone is a serious problem for a lot of people and if you find a natural substitute. Hey, why not?
5360020	5364180	Absolutely. This is the direction you need to go in. Look how animated you've gotten. This is like your passion
5364500	5366660	Why don't you why don't you plug where you work right now?
5366740	5370900	And when there's a line outside tomorrow tell your boss I should be an associate something. Yes

5435540	5438180	Someday you might be on harband town, but fuck you already are
5439460	5441460	She's so far ahead of you
5442420	5447060	You had to actually be a therapist and practice for years to end up on harband town
5447700	5452180	You may create a harband town. Emily created it. She was the only down this podcast only exists
5453140	5455140	Emily gordon. Emily gordon is the reason
5461460	5464580	It's a little misleading but i'll i'll take the applause. Thank you
5465060	5470180	Emily gordon asked a recently fired from uh, nbc. Dan harman. Would you want to do a show right?
5470980	5474260	Yeah, we were just at a bar and I was like, I i'm running this theater in la
5474820	5479780	And uh, I desperately need shows you should just get on stage and talk and you're like, okay
5480660	5482660	I've been waiting for someone to say that
5483940	5488100	I thought it was supposed to be a shame to that and I would say it's it's like it's a heat
5488340	5491940	Yeah, it's become the thing that's it's it's that what that theater is known for
5492100	5497460	Yeah, can we start like an anarchist and nicholas kind of like little like society where where colin
5497940	5499940	like gives us bongs and
5500260	5502740	Lauren and emily give us psychological advice
5504500	5507780	And kumail does whatever kumail does, you know
5508340	5511780	We we all I say I say I say things are racist
5513540	5515780	But for free, but for free, you don't charge
5516580	5520500	It's it's mutual reciprocity and we all we all just like we all just provide everything
5520500	5521620	I feel like
5521620	5526340	Like for the vibe that we got on we walked on stage and the amount of like volume and love that you
5526660	5528660	You get when you come into a harmontown show
5529620	5531620	Not to inflate this own balloon
5531620	5536900	But like like walking down the street and the people come up like oh shit like this is harmontown
5537220	5540500	There's a feeling of community there and I feel like there's a there's a possibility that
5540740	5546260	If we all just felt passionate and moved in or out of each other's apartments or back to their parents apartments
5546740	5549780	And all did whatever we all loved to do. They're like something fantastic
5550020	5553160	We could get back on just run in there with 4 000 people from ontario
5554980	5558820	All right, and what were they saying they'd say they'd say take off
5560420	5562420	Say no these hosers aren't taking off
5563220	5567220	These these hosers are here to stay these hosers are

5600580	5602580	This seemed like a great bunch
5604100	5606100	I feel like we got the wrong people on stage

5611700	5614020	He's he's he's fine down there he's fine down there

5689300	5691300	Uh
5691780	5698840	Uh, the are you are you guys there's no way you're are you even familiar with john benet ramsey?
5704020	5707540	This seems like a crazy thing to bring up two hours into a show
5709060	5713220	And even crazier thing to cheer for like they just said you two was coming on stick
5713860	5718020	Well, they just did a whole are you into true crime? Are you love true crime? I haven't watched that but love
5718580	5720580	the john benet thing
5720900	5728740	Is it good? There's a guy. Dr. Henry lee who's a forensic wizard who has a very very thick accent
5728820	5730820	like he's chinese and he
5731140	5736980	Like he clearly has dedicated most of his brain to like like studying forensics and like it's um
5737220	5739700	Well, what like what does he sound like? He's
5741860	5744980	I think it would go a little something. Yeah, go ahead like this
5745380	5750260	In his voice, let's say let's say he was talking about cast-off patterns of blood on the wall
5751300	5753460	Maybe it was um, let's do this. I mean just
5756820	5761800	Let's say something really inoffensive he's a waiter at a chinese restaurant faithful impression
5763620	5769860	Technically I was going to culminate this in in doing an impression of him. Okay, go right. All right
5770500	5774340	But it won't be racist because it's that one guy. It's not a whole race
5775780	5779860	I'm actually this is just a personal attack. This is a personal
5784900	5787460	Anyway this filthy chinese guy what was he saying?
5788820	5791540	He's a genius in his feet. He walks into a bar
5793380	5796260	With a with a with a nobel prize winning pollock and
5798340	5804500	And a very uh nurturing rabbi, uh, and the bartender just comes everywhere and
5804980	5806980	hits the ceiling
5808180	5814900	Okay, go ahead. Look they're talking about the kid like japanese like like they like it comes down to this bowl of pineapple
5815460	5816740	and uh
5816740	5817940	Are you serious?
5817940	5818260	Yeah
5818260	5824660	Like the kid the brother is like eating pineapple and like that's a theory that like because she had some pineapple in her stomach
5824740	5829300	That was digested on a certain amount that you know, if you do a timeline, it's like well
5829860	5831380	They're just like
5831620	5833780	And so dr. Henry lee is explaining he's like
5834340	5840500	Like the theory of like what if the brother got really mad the nine-year-old brother that she took a piece of pineapple
5841140	5848020	Out of his uh out of his bowl. Well, hold on, sir. I heard somebody i'm fascinated that you're agitated by
5848500	5850500	I i'm not i'm not making fun of me
5855060	5860340	He's explaining he's going like like how did she get clobbered in the back of the head with a heavy object and
5860580	5866500	Like like what does it have to do with the pineapple and he's explaining he and he says, uh, well, how about this?
5869060	5872500	She come she take he say
5873940	5875940	Don't steal my papel
5877060	5881700	That's it that's it i've never heard so many consonants removed from a word
5883380	5887700	I guess just one but it's it's just like such a don't don't steal my papel
5887780	5892660	That's a key consonant. He's miming a nine-year-old killing a six-year-old and he's just like
5892980	5896900	It's just like this is so much glee and he's so smart and he's like and it's like it's just adorable
5896900	5900740	Like I wanted to make it like a little meme like don't steal my papel
5902180	5906500	So his theory is that the brother was eating a bowl of papel
5907460	5911700	The sister was no the brother was and the sister took the
5912660	5917060	And then he that's his theory and then there was like a giant eight pound maglite and he with his
5917380	5920260	Nine-year-old peter parker fucking powers. He was like, fuck you
5921780	5925780	What there was was an empty bowl of pineapple he used that to kill her that's the border weapon
5926020	5928740	Okay, you know, what do you do? Would you just making that shit up?
5929460	5933940	There was a full bowl of pineapple that supports the theory. That's that that shit was interrupted that
5934660	5936580	Oh, he was sitting there
5936660	5941300	And then they show the brother like they show him like they're reviewing the case and they show him a picture of the
5941540	5943540	Of the crime scene, but not the crime scene
5943540	5948900	But the from the house and they show him that there's a bowl of pineapple they go what's that and he's like, I don't know
5950260	5953860	No idea what pineapple is because he's fuck he's like because they didn't call it papel
5953860	5957220	Oh shit that that's the most important fruit in the world
5957220	5961300	So that the whole family is involved in disposing of her body. I think they covered it up, right?
5961700	5963700	The brother killed her by mistake
5963700	5967060	It kind of emerges as a as a i'm not going to say an uplifting story
5967060	5971060	But it kind of like when you look back on it, you go like I think what we're about to do is one of the greatest
5971140	5973140	improv reenactments
5979540	5985140	The story is a story that must be told I don't it goes to john bidet ramsey's like no
5985940	5991540	Please I know I can't I know good can come of that. I think we'll all wake up with cancer like
5991700	5993060	like
5993060	5995540	Like that makes us all worse than everyone
5996180	5999620	But they did in this show this cbs show that they did this two-part
5999860	6001860	one of the things they did is they
6002020	6006900	They're demonstrating like the how the wound was made and they have like everybody
6007380	6012980	Agrees that the low point of this thing was they put up. They put a blonde wig on a pig head
6014100	6017220	Like the myth busters and had a child actor boy
6018180	6021140	That was the right age come in hold the flashlight
6022580	6029220	And the our friends karen kilgera from georgia from uh, from my favorite murder are describing that and they're like
6029380	6032340	They're like, yeah, he's a child actor. So he's already somewhere else
6033700	6035700	and the look at and he's
6036340	6042020	Child actor clubbing a pig head in a wig with a mag like to demonstrate how it would have been
6042100	6044740	I can't wait to see his one-man show. It's gonna be great
6044980	6051220	Yeah, he's got that sounds like the role of a lifetime. Yeah, this show is called a papa day
6052580	6053300	Okay
6053300	6055300	Well, how about this pen apple thing, huh?
6055380	6059060	This uh that crazy guy doing that dance you guys familiar with that viral thing?
6059220	6062020	I saw and I was like, you know what some things I don't need to click on
6062580	6067300	So I didn't click on it what it is. If you clicked on it, it would go like this. I have an apple
6067860	6069860	I have a pen
6069860	6071860	I got an apple pen
6071860	6074760	I got a pen. I got a pineapple
6075460	6076740	totally coincidence
6076740	6083460	Uh, I got a pen pineapple. I don't really know the actual how it goes. Wait, but it's very catchy
6084740	6087220	Oh, they call it the new gangnam style or whatever. Yeah
6088900	6091460	Style gangnam style kind of the gangnam style
6096660	6098900	It's sort of a bat mitzvah for a gangnam style
