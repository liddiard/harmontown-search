0	26560	From the beautiful Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia!
26560	27560	We're not in the main room.
27560	31320	We're in a sexy little underground dungeon called the studio here.
31320	34240	Harman Town is in session.
34240	40000	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden.
40000	43000	Hey guys.
43000	47800	How's it going man?
47800	49920	Oh, I'm good.
49920	51560	You're looking good.
51560	52560	No.
52560	53560	You're not good.
53560	54560	Well let's make things good.
54560	56560	Let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman.
56560	57560	Let's bring out the mayor of Harman.
57560	57560	
87560	96960	Hello for the second night, Sydney, Australia, port capital of the world, a shiphole to the
96960	105120	planet, the big city in the place down there.
105120	108240	I'm not afraid to say it.
108240	112000	You've been wonderful to us.
112000	113000	What was I going to...
113000	115840	Hold on.
115840	126720	I did a panel tonight and you're not allowed to ask for your money back.
126720	134880	I'm not in charge of that, but it's going to be a bad show.
134880	140000	Are you saying that we're not going to get a chicken dinner after the show tonight?
140000	144600	Because I distinctly wished you took us before the show.
144680	150520	When I say bad show, you need to lower your bar, because here's the thing that happened
150520	151520	last night.
151520	158840	As you know, I'm afraid of the fact that I don't have an axe, so I'll often do a wrap.
158840	167320	I'll end the show with a wrap, because it's like, oh, they have to applaud, and then you
167320	170320	got to do something to end the show that has no...
170320	179120	I did a wrap about Australia, and said the word Australia, and I couldn't rhyme it.
179120	184920	Then everyone starts yelling out, genitalia, and all this shit.
184920	191720	But I just want to point out to you that that's a pretty cool thing, that you, to buy a ticket
191720	197720	to a performer who is so committed to not preparing for a show, that he can spend a
197720	207040	15-hour flight to a continent he's pretty sure he'll be rapping about.
207040	215000	And he doesn't have a rhyme, one rhyme, for the name of the continent.
215000	222680	That's what you're getting when you come to my show, is not corporate bullshit.
222680	227240	Keebler didn't decide what you'd be tasting.
227240	229840	Sometimes therefore it will be shit.
229840	233040	Sometimes you'll be tasting shit.
233040	236040	Sometimes it's Harry Potter's Dumbledore...
236040	237040	What?
237040	239720	Sometimes you get a nice chookus.
239720	241480	A nice what?
241480	242480	What?
243200	245680	Do you not listen to the beginning of the show?
245680	249760	I found out the chookus, which is there break a leg, means that you get a chicken dinner
249760	251680	after the show if you do a good job.
251680	254640	Oh, no, no, I don't listen to the...
254640	255640	No.
255640	257920	What am I supposed to listen to?
257920	258920	What are you doing back there?
258920	261960	I'm getting in the zone.
261960	265440	You're coming up with rhymes for Tasmania.
265440	268200	This conflict is hilarious, but we couldn't hear you back there.
268200	269200	Oh, okay.
269920	273440	I mean, sometimes I'll make a crack if I notice it's been eight minutes.
273440	279240	I'll go, hey, can Jeff keep it to a tight tenure?
279240	281280	I don't hear what's happening.
281280	292160	All I hear is the sound of my laughs getting sucked into your hat.
292160	293160	You know that metaphor.
293160	294160	You know the old...
294160	295160	The old...
295160	296160	I think it was...
296160	297160	The laugh-sucking hat.
297280	298280	The laugh-sucking hat.
298280	299280	The laugh-sucking hat.
299280	300280	Yeah.
300280	301280	Like Roald Dahl.
301280	302280	Yeah.
302280	303280	Yeah.
303280	304280	Anyways.
304280	306280	No, I don't know.
306280	307280	I didn't hear...
307280	308280	No, I didn't hear...
308280	309280	Tell me.
309280	311000	You already told me.
311000	312000	I got scared.
312000	313000	You came back.
313000	314360	I thought you were saying they're rowdy tonight.
314360	316760	You were like, there's a lot of people.
316760	317760	They seem fine.
317760	320120	No, they're just good fun here.
320120	321120	We thought...
321120	325640	I mean, like, Brisbane was a little nutty and Melbourn a guy vomited in his shoe and then
325640	328120	got in a fight.
328120	329120	And then...
329120	330120	But in a hip way.
330120	331120	Yeah.
331120	334000	That made you ask, what's a shoe?
334000	336000	How do you puke in it?
336000	337000	9-11!
337000	338000	9-11!
338000	339000	9-11!
339000	342600	Well, it's the earliest that's ever been 9-11 in our show.
342600	343600	Yeah.
343600	346120	This is going to be the 9-11 of shows.
346120	348080	Thank you.
348080	351760	Thank you, 9-11 watchers.
351760	353800	That's it.
353800	355320	Our international scouts.
356120	357120	Be honest.
357120	361720	Is there anybody here that actually sets like an alarm for that so that they won't forget
361720	362720	that it's 9-11?
362720	363720	You.
363720	364720	You.
364720	368720	We got Australian Dave Klein out there.
368720	369720	You.
369720	370720	Mate.
370720	371720	All right.
371720	372720	Okay.
372720	376160	It's our last night in Sydney.
376160	380080	Let's take this relationship to a deeper place than we have.
380080	381080	First with sincerity.
381080	382080	I'm not going to say.
382080	383080	It's nice weather.
383320	386920	Your opera house is shaped funny, like a porcupine.
386920	387920	We're beyond that.
387920	388920	We're now into the surface.
388920	391400	I want to say kudos to you.
391400	395480	It seems like my girlfriend pointed out and I was like, yeah, you're right.
395480	397760	I think I did notice that too.
397760	402840	There's a very gentlemanly sidewalk culture here.
402840	409760	Gentlemen do not or are not guaranteed to fucking leer and cat call and hoozle witzle.
409760	412240	Did you not notice that?
412240	413800	Are you guys not proud of that?
413800	416040	Oh, well, I'm not sure what you're talking about.
416040	419160	You're saying that they're, they're, they're, they're gentlemanly towards women walking
419160	420160	down the street.
420160	421160	Yeah.
421160	422160	They don't scream at women.
422160	425400	There's not as much rubber necking and like kind of intimidation and stuff like stranger
425400	426400	to stranger.
426400	428360	Well, all the women disagree with you.
428360	429360	Okay.
429360	430360	All right.
430360	431360	Well, what do they know?
431360	432360	Well, that's crazy.
432360	433360	Yeah.
433360	436360	I never got cat called once.
437360	443720	Those seats could have been filled with juicy cocks.
443720	445720	This is a man's show.
445720	453760	I want, I want juicy nuts and hard cocks in those seats.
453760	457360	That's the Harman town guarantee.
457360	459360	I was walking down the road by myself in Brisbane.
459360	464360	I went over to the west end and there was a guy that was honking his horn and he yelled
464360	466960	out to, I'm assuming a woman.
466960	467960	I mean, it could have, could have been anybody.
467960	468960	He's like, you got a fairness.
468960	469960	Oh, okay.
469960	470960	I guess that was all right.
470960	471960	Yeah.
471960	472960	I don't know what.
472960	473960	Yeah.
473960	474960	What would I think?
474960	480120	What would be the best case scenario that you guys would all pull, applaud yourselves?
480120	481120	You're right.
481120	483040	We do have no sexual harassment in our city.
483040	486520	You would be the worst city in the world if you did that, even if it was true, that you'd
486520	487520	be shitty.
487520	488880	Here's how polite things are.
488880	492360	I took a little wander today and I ended up as a kind of no direction.
492360	497120	My phone data wasn't working, so I said, I'm just going to walk.
497120	498720	I can still see where the downtown is.
498720	499720	I know it my way back.
499720	504000	Then I ended up at King's Cross and there was a bunch of bikers over there hanging out
504000	508240	in front of whorehouses, like in strip clubs, right?
508240	509240	10 a.m.
509240	510640	Everybody's in casinos and strip clubs.
510640	521640	It is a million like Hell's Angels looking bikers and they were the nicest people.
521640	525400	I guess the first way I received that is I feel like you're beating me at some kind
525400	528360	of traveling contest.
528360	531080	I had waffles.
531080	534040	Well Jeff is way better at traveling than you.
534040	535680	I never wanted to find that out, you know?
535680	538600	It's not why I invited him.
538600	539600	Invited me?
539600	540600	Yeah.
540600	541600	Right, yeah.
541600	542600	That's right, sir.
542600	543600	Oh, and now it all comes out.
543600	546600	Yeah, that's right, I invited you.
546600	553320	I saw your e-vite and I said yes.
553320	561920	Can we bring out a professional from the Australian Entertainment District, a friend I made tonight?
561920	563400	I want you to meet my friend, Josh Thomas.
577600	581000	Okay, I just want you to be happy.
581000	583000	Do I sit here?
583000	585000	That ship has sailed, Josh.
585000	589000	Yes, I've noticed the bottle of vodka.
589000	593680	All right, and this isn't, you've never been on the show so you don't know.
593680	595720	This is me, I know, so I'm not a performer.
595720	596720	You're not tweeting.
596720	597720	I get it.
597720	598720	I'm not tweeting.
598720	599720	I'm not like looking.
599720	600720	I'm like, who else could have been.
600720	602720	It's Tracy Ullman still.
602720	607840	But honestly, I mean, it's like not making any bones about the fact that I've not seen
607840	610240	a single frame of your work.
610240	612240	We just met.
612240	616640	I just met and I just liked him sitting next to him at a thing, and I think Luke's here
616640	620840	and I don't want Luke to think that means I don't like him and anybody that wants him.
620840	622840	Well, he seemed to have just said that.
622840	623840	All right.
623840	624840	I was sitting nearest you.
624840	629040	I'm worried because I feel like we did the panel today and I had a nice time with you
629040	632920	and you had a nice time with me and then you thought, let's keep this going.
632920	635520	And I just don't know if it's going to happen again.
635520	637480	I really really like chasing the heroine.
637480	638480	I don't want to do that.
638480	639480	Yeah, I know.
639480	641720	Let's resign ourselves to not liking each other.
641720	642720	No, no.
642720	643720	We'll just get there now.
643720	644720	I fucking hate you.
644720	646680	We don't like the cut of each other's gyps.
646680	650320	We're strangers to each other, but we have strangers up on stage in the show all the
650320	651320	time.
651320	652320	We get to know them.
652320	653320	You're an Australian.
653320	654320	Sorry for saying that I hate you.
654320	655320	It's okay.
655320	656320	Well, I like you.
657080	667160	And if you said you hated me, as long as most people hate me because I'm a genius.
667160	668460	And then I'm like bulletproof.
668460	674560	But if you hate me because I'm not talented, then I have to figure out a way to kill you.
674560	679400	I have literally no feelings towards you.
679400	683120	There's a lot more ways than just those two to hate you.
683120	685000	Like so many ways.
686000	693680	There's all these accesses of hate that don't even cross talent or genius at all.
693680	697640	You know, let's just, I mean, race for one.
697640	699880	People hate people for race all the time.
699880	703400	The fact that you think all seats should be filled with juicy balls.
703400	704400	Right.
704400	706480	Hard cocks.
706480	709760	Do you think I should be hated for that, Josh Thomas?
709760	712160	I thought it was very progressive of me.
712160	713160	Yeah.
713600	715600	I also like juicy cock.
715600	716600	Yeah.
716600	721240	If you want to make an advocate omelet, you're going to have to break 51% of the population's
721240	722240	eggs.
722240	723240	Yeah.
723240	724240	No.
724240	725600	You have to hate women to love gays.
725600	726600	Yeah.
726600	727600	Yes.
727600	729720	So, shall it be written?
729720	731720	So, shall it be done?
731720	732720	Making up these rules.
732720	733720	That's not a rule.
733720	734720	Don't worry, everybody.
734720	735720	All right.
735720	736720	So I made that mistake.
736720	737720	I made that faux pas.
737720	738720	I was like...
738720	741480	When my girlfriend says it, I took it seriously.
741480	742480	She's a girl.
742480	743480	She wouldn't lie.
743480	744480	She was like...
744480	745480	I actually...
745480	749760	And I guess what I did as I ran it through my perception is I didn't have any moment
749760	754040	since I landed on this continent.
754040	755920	I haven't met a prick.
755920	757880	I haven't met a passive aggressive person.
757880	761960	I haven't met anything that meets my definition of a bad person.
761960	769400	And that especially includes I haven't felt like I was in a pissing contest with any men
769400	770400	that I hadn't met.
771320	772680	And I just feel that way all the time.
772680	775120	We will tell you that we're awful.
775120	780520	That's how we're like, hello, I'm sorry for existing, I'm a slug, I'm disgusting, I smell
780520	785720	bad, I've wasted your time, please leave me alone.
785720	789320	And Americans, they do the opposite, so they tell me how good they are, and it took me
789320	794000	a long time in America to work out that I'm not meant to do that, because if you go to
794000	797080	an American and you say, like, oh, I'm a slug, they're like...
797080	798080	Great.
798400	801520	While I've wasted my time talking to this slug.
801520	802520	Right, right.
802520	804640	Or they'll say, we love slugs.
804640	805640	Do we love slugs?
805640	808360	Love slugs.
808360	813680	We have a hundred slug pile you could sit in and absorb the moisture in a room so my
813680	814680	feet feel better.
814680	819600	Like, they'll play it up, they're like, this is huge, Will Ferrell did this, and now look.
819600	821760	Anyways, just warning me.
821760	826120	Josh, I learned from my friend Lee, that's from here, of a thing called the Tall Poppy
826120	827120	Syndrome.
827480	828480	Do you know about this, Dan?
828480	829480	No.
829480	830480	Tall Poppy gets cut, right?
830480	831480	Yeah, like...
839480	842840	Spencer, cut into the chase.
842840	844600	I know all the things.
844600	848960	You are not supposed to be a taller poppy than the rest of the field, like, if you are,
848960	850480	you're going to get...
850480	853120	People want to chop you down, like, you don't want to stand out, right?
853120	854120	But do not like...
854120	856120	Why does that feel so natural?
858120	860120	Do you not feel that?
860120	864720	I think what you said just before, like, in the States, no, like, you are rewarded for
864720	865720	being a tall poppy.
865720	867720	Lee, how did you word that?
867720	871720	You mean like the Quentin Crisp quote?
871720	873720	Oh, was it Quentin Crisp?
873720	875720	Well, we were talking about a couple things, so...
875720	876720	Yep.
876720	877720	Hi, everyone.
877720	879720	We're quoting...
879720	881720	Tell us the Quentin Crisp quote.
882320	884320	It was the idea that...
884320	886320	This guy was left...
886320	888320	Here, I'm going to give you a mic.
891320	893320	Dreams coming true.
893320	895320	You're all here for this.
895320	896320	Hey, buddy.
896320	898320	It was the idea that...
898320	901320	Quentin, you have to correct me when I get this incredibly wrong.
901320	909320	Quentin Crisp was a socialite and an advocate and an openly gay man in a time when it was
909320	910320	not okay to be gay.
910320	911320	Gross.
911920	914920	It's sad, in my opinion.
914920	916920	It's a hot take.
916920	918920	Juicy cock, though, so...
918920	920920	It is gross.
920920	922920	Gay sex is gross.
922920	924920	Gross like a fox.
924920	928920	There's one thing we can all agree on is that gay sex is disgusting.
928920	930920	Please continue.
930920	932920	OK.
932920	934920	So sorry.
936920	938920	This is so weird, everybody.
939520	941520	Are you gay?
941520	942520	I'm not.
942520	943520	OK.
943520	944520	I could learn.
944520	946520	So tight.
946520	948520	I could teach you.
948520	950520	Wouldn't he be a great guy?
950520	952520	He looks like a...
952520	954520	If Errol Flynn was a hustler.
958520	960520	He looks like a faggot.
960520	962520	That's what he looks like.
962520	964520	Not only does he have the awesome Douglas Fairbanks Jr.
964520	968520	mustache, I found out today he's also really good at archery and he's...
969120	971120	He can fence, so he is...
971120	973120	He's a pirate.
973120	975120	If Robin Hood pirates...
975120	977120	Pirates don't use archery.
977120	979120	Lee, Lee.
979120	981120	Lee, just come up here, come on.
981120	983120	Lee Lanay, everybody.
983120	985120	Welcome to Lee and my friend.
985120	988120	I know I'm a guest here, but I would like to know
988120	990120	why do you know this boy?
990120	992120	I know...
992120	994120	We used to date.
994120	996120	I know his father
996720	999720	He's a music producer from London, but he lives in Los Angeles.
999720	1002720	And when Lee comes out to visit, we've hung out there.
1002720	1003720	OK.
1003720	1005720	It's not just you're in a suit, I'm in a suit.
1005720	1007720	Well, let me tell you a thing.
1007720	1009720	A sexual quote at once.
1011720	1013720	You, sir, I have a couple questions about pocket squares.
1013720	1015720	I would like to ask you.
1015720	1017720	What was the quote?
1017720	1019720	I forget how that goes.
1019720	1025720	He said he was being asked about why he left England and went to New York.
1026320	1033320	And he said, in England, people will hold you back in fear
1033320	1036320	that when you get to the top, you will have forgotten them.
1036320	1040320	But in America, people will raise you up
1040320	1043320	knowing you'll be there to lend them a hand when you get there.
1046320	1049320	But here, the tall poppy thing is like...
1049320	1051320	Fuck that guy.
1051320	1053320	Yeah.
1053320	1055320	He's shinier than me.
1055320	1057320	He's Milwaukee like that.
1057320	1060320	Dan, didn't you say that these aren't the people they don't want you to rise up in the same way?
1060320	1062320	Yeah, I think there's a...
1062320	1063320	Yeah.
1063320	1066320	If you live in a town where most people make the most money
1066320	1069320	lifting things with their physical arms.
1069320	1072320	And New York is one of those cities, even though there's so much energy.
1078320	1083320	There's going to be more antipathy or disconnect between the idea of...
1084320	1087320	As I've always said, if you live in Milwaukee
1087320	1094320	and you don't believe that living in warm weather will kill you,
1094320	1097320	why are you living in Milwaukee?
1097320	1101320	Your brain has to make certain justifications.
1101320	1104320	And I'm not saying those are false, because it is fucked up to live in Los Angeles.
1104320	1106320	There's a million bad reasons to live there.
1106320	1110320	I don't know, there's a Harrison Bergeron kind of like...
1110320	1115320	Yeah, like discouragement of exceptionality.
1115320	1119320	The poppy thing we're talking about, that's a culture where it's like
1119320	1122320	very wisely fuck this person.
1122320	1126320	Who is this person that keeps obsessing about how good it can get?
1126320	1128320	How close to the sun they can get?
1128320	1130320	They seem like trouble, let's get them out of here.
1130320	1134320	That seems like a wise social policy, but one that would never profit me.
1134320	1135320	Do you not feel that way?
1135320	1136320	Do I not feel...
1136320	1138320	Does that look like a natural thing to you?
1138320	1141320	He just told you to hate him because he's a genius.
1141320	1146320	No, no, that's a voice I hear in my head all the time.
1146320	1150320	It's like you're pretentious, what are you doing, get your head out of your ass.
1150320	1153320	If you were going to have sex with a boy, right?
1153320	1157320	I'm listening, it would go a little something.
1157320	1162320	Would you want him to have a bigger dick than you or a smaller dick than you?
1162320	1170320	Oh my God.
1170320	1175320	This show does deserve to be in an opera house.
1175320	1178320	This isn't some fucking bullshit podcast, this is amazing.
1178320	1184320	This is the first time I'm 43, I've never answered that.
1184320	1190320	Well, I guess, do I want to have the thing in my butt or do I want to...
1190320	1192320	It's really up to you to decide.
1192320	1196320	Can I answer a question with a question, but I'll keep the ball in my court.
1196320	1200320	I do want to know, is it...
1200320	1206320	It's politically incorrect to ask questions about who's pitching, who's catching, those are distinctions.
1206320	1209320	Is there different ways to be gay?
1209320	1214320	Yeah, there's different ways to be gay.
1214320	1217320	Can you be a gay person that hates anal sex?
1217320	1221320	You can love oral sex and hate anal sex and be a gay guy, right?
1221320	1223320	Yeah.
1223320	1225320	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
1225320	1229320	Because I need to know before I answer my question, because I need to know my options.
1229320	1232320	Can be anything you want to be.
1232320	1234320	You're right, I'm sorry.
1234320	1237320	You can decide you don't want to do anal sex.
1237320	1240320	I just realized you can decide you don't want to have dicks in.
1240320	1246320	The gay guy who doesn't want to do any anal sex is not going to be a very popular gay guy.
1246320	1249320	Good luck out there, I don't have time for him.
1249320	1252320	I don't know about you, I don't have time for him.
1252320	1257320	But there's definitely gays who don't put dicks in there, and there's gays who don't put their dicks in.
1257320	1259320	Can you let people know, can you be gay?
1259320	1261320	This is called Grindr.
1261320	1267320	And that's what's so good about technology, is now you get to discuss it in a tense detail.
1267320	1269320	You can say you're a top or a bottom.
1269320	1271320	What are you into?
1271320	1272320	Question mark.
1272320	1273320	Me?
1273320	1275320	That's what you say in the app.
1275320	1278320	It's actually a bit weird to me that you don't know this, but of course...
1278320	1281320	It's weird to me too, just to be clear.
1281320	1283320	Smaller dick, smaller dick.
1283320	1285320	I forget the world isn't...
1285320	1287320	Smaller dick.
1287320	1293320	I figured it out, I've been thinking through it, and I asked some dumb questions that made me think...
1293320	1297320	I don't mean because you're scared of putting a big dick in you.
1297320	1300320	I mean, because obviously it's festive to have a bigger dick.
1300320	1302320	That's like a fun...
1303320	1306320	You can hang decorations off of it.
1306320	1312320	I wasn't asking about your pain thresholds, I was saying...
1312320	1314320	Well I was considering that, I was.
1314320	1319320	If in the spirit of like, obviously presumably it's better to have a big dick.
1319320	1321320	Because it's so fun.
1321320	1327320	Dan, you and your gay lover are getting in the shower after some horse play.
1327320	1329320	After the horse play.
1330320	1336320	After the loving, or the first thing in the morning, you're in the shower and you're soaping each other up.
1336320	1339320	Do you want to look over and go, oh this guy's got a bigger dick than me, or do you want to go,
1339320	1341320	I'll go bake my fucking dick as compared to this guy.
1341320	1345320	Yeah, are you like, oh I've got such a big dick, isn't that...
1345320	1348320	Oh look how big a dick I found.
1354320	1358320	We're going to win a fucking Emmy or a Tony for this, this is amazing.
1359320	1367320	I think, well before he brought up the shower, I was just thinking like, okay little dick, I'm overthinking it.
1367320	1374320	I was just like, little dick, because I want to cuddle with a smaller of...
1374320	1376320	You want to be...
1376320	1379320	As heterosexual as you can be.
1379320	1382320	Can he have a vagina?
1382320	1383320	But isn't that...
1383320	1386320	You want to be a papa bear, and by the way you wouldn't be a bear.
1386320	1390320	But then when he brought up the shower, which was like, we were soaping each other up,
1390320	1395320	but then the idea, oh look what a big dick my lover has, I was like, oh well, I mean yeah,
1395320	1398320	I haven't thought through this enough, I'm not overthinking it.
1398320	1404320	I should think really hard about this, I should think about this for years.
1404320	1408320	Because there's a version of me that would be like, oh I'm like a baby man,
1408320	1413320	and when you're gay, you don't have to be like, I'm a baby man.
1413320	1415320	You could be like, I'm a baby man.
1415320	1423320	I could be like a baby man, and a smaller, smarter dude could just let me have it and own me.
1423320	1424320	I definitely want to have it.
1424320	1428320	And he could have a huge dick, and I could soap it up and go like, this is gigantic,
1428320	1430320	and I would not be jealous of it.
1430320	1431320	And that's a fun fight.
1431320	1434320	Like I own this dick.
1434320	1438320	I get it, it's like a...
1439320	1445320	I've been making the mistake of thinking that the dial at the very top,
1445320	1451320	misogyny and gayness are like, I thought there was like an oven dial,
1451320	1454320	but you can go backwards, you can just go click.
1454320	1461320	I'm a person that's a narcissist that reflects itself in misogyny if I'm straight.
1461320	1464320	It could actually, the solution could be being gay.
1465320	1468320	The solution is to be gay.
1468320	1470320	You're fucking it up.
1470320	1473320	I guess I got excited too long winded away.
1473320	1475320	I want them to have the smallest dick.
1475320	1476320	I want a micro penis.
1476320	1478320	I want to be the one with the big dick.
1478320	1480320	That's what I want.
1480320	1483320	You want to have a taller puppy.
1483320	1488320	I just want to be a lot happier if I...
1488320	1491320	Is it a sense of like a self-esteem thing?
1491320	1493320	Yes, it's a self-esteem thing.
1494320	1502320	You kind of high-rode at me when I had the exact same answer as you.
1502320	1505320	No, but you were just thinking about the mechanics.
1505320	1508320	I wanted to know spiritually.
1508320	1511320	You mean if I go through an entire spiritual journey,
1511320	1515320	I'll come around to wanting the same things I do as a gross straight guy?
1515320	1519320	As you're like, you know, I think we finished.
1519320	1522320	Yeah, I should learn to read the room.
1522320	1523320	They ended the bit.
1523320	1525320	They're like, great, you did it.
1525320	1526320	That's who's on first.
1526320	1530320	I mean, obviously, I'd like to talk for another 45 minutes of hour.
1530320	1532320	What about testicles?
1532320	1534320	Okay, so you're with a girl.
1534320	1536320	Who do you want to have bigger tits?
1536320	1540320	Dan has talked about at length that he has enormous balls.
1540320	1542320	You've got very large balls.
1542320	1545320	Well, I just need to tell myself that for, obviously, reasons.
1545320	1551320	There's a photo of Dan that his girlfriend took where he's laying on his back.
1551320	1553320	He's smiling, he's aware that it's happening,
1553320	1556320	but she's already gotten the camera out because he's wearing boxes,
1556320	1558320	and just his balls are out.
1558320	1569320	And there's just this incredible, like, the color is like a tropical sunset kind of pinkish orange.
1569320	1570320	I don't know what's going on there.
1570320	1572320	They're just fucking huge.
1572320	1575320	Is this podcast video or just audio?
1575320	1576320	It's odd.
1576320	1580320	It's a shame that they're not going to hear the look in your eyes as you talk about.
1581320	1582320	His balls.
1582320	1585320	It's a shame they can't hear the glint you had.
1585320	1589320	Yeah, for the subscribers, we could probably put up imagery over here.
1589320	1591320	It would be nice, I think.
1591320	1593320	I got lost.
1593320	1597320	You got lost in my eyes when I was talking about Dan's balls.
1597320	1601320	Because this is going to be the best for some of our lives tonight.
1601320	1602320	All right.
1602320	1604320	I think it's hilarious that your friend is still up here.
1604320	1607320	I just want to point that out, but I don't want to believe.
1607320	1608320	I don't want to believe.
1608320	1609320	I think it's funny now.
1609320	1610320	I think it's funny that he's up here.
1610320	1613320	Well, I'm now just listening to the podcast.
1613320	1614320	Yeah, I know.
1614320	1615320	And that's what happens.
1615320	1616320	That's what happens.
1616320	1617320	That's what I do.
1617320	1618320	Yeah.
1618320	1619320	But let's look.
1619320	1620320	I'm going to take a little.
1620320	1626320	Watch this genius turn into the dunes of the Australian dunes.
1626320	1629320	Spencer used to catch seagulls.
1629320	1631320	Yeah.
1631320	1634320	Spencer revealed to us that...
1634320	1636320	In confidence.
1637320	1640320	No, that's a joke.
1640320	1641320	It's a joke.
1641320	1642320	It's true.
1642320	1643320	It is true.
1643320	1644320	I never saw it.
1644320	1645320	It's fine.
1645320	1646320	I'm going to talk about it.
1646320	1647320	I just put it right in the ring.
1647320	1648320	It's fine.
1648320	1649320	Actually, Cody told me, you're going to put the thing.
1649320	1650320	Yeah.
1650320	1651320	I'm going to put the link.
1651320	1653320	I missed the top of you explaining this.
1653320	1660320	Spencer, we went to the aquarium today because I love fish and forgot I hate people.
1660320	1666320	But Spencer, at some point, was talking to the group and I was just lost.
1666320	1673320	But by the time I came into the conversation, Spencer was explaining that during his wayward
1673320	1674320	youth in...
1674320	1675320	Where were you?
1675320	1676320	Simi Valley?
1676320	1677320	Where is this taking place?
1677320	1678320	For more part.
1678320	1680320	Well, we were at the beach.
1680320	1681320	Okay.
1681320	1682320	You would go to the beach in your youth.
1682320	1683320	Yeah.
1683320	1685320	It's hard to imagine you at the beach.
1685320	1686320	Right.
1686320	1687320	That's why I stopped.
1687320	1693320	Explain this thing that you would do if you don't mind.
1693320	1694320	All right.
1694320	1695320	So, you go to the beach.
1695320	1698320	You lay down in the sand.
1698320	1703320	I didn't always have this beard.
1703320	1707320	Without a beard, it makes a lot more sense.
1707320	1712320	If you go to the beach with that beard, people think you just washed up on shore.
1712320	1716320	People think you're there to reclaim creatures.
1716320	1721320	You promised me a white bull.
1721320	1723320	Release the Kraken.
1723320	1724320	I forgot.
1724320	1725320	That's a hacked reference.
1725320	1727320	I was just saying it mythically.
1727320	1728320	Release the Kraken.
1728320	1730320	I was going to own it.
1730320	1731320	All right.
1731320	1733320	I'm at the beach.
1733320	1736320	What you do is you bury...
1736320	1737320	You get someone to cover...
1737320	1739320	Well, you could do it yourself.
1739320	1744320	You cover your legs and stomach and most of your chest and sand such that you're buried
1744320	1745320	beneath the sand.
1745320	1747320	Up to your neck.
1747320	1748320	Well, no.
1748320	1750320	I said the parts you cover.
1750320	1753320	The legs and the stomach.
1753320	1759320	Your upper chest, your head and your arms stay over the sand, but you have a towel,
1759320	1762320	a beach towel, covering the whole lot.
1762320	1766320	So, for all intents and purposes, it looks like someone put someone's head underneath
1766320	1768320	a beach towel.
1768320	1772320	It's like that scene in The Virgin where he's trying to convince everyone he's had sex
1772320	1773320	with a woman.
1773320	1777320	And he's like, you know, when you're having sex with a woman, he's never been to the beach.
1777320	1779320	And then she's coming.
1779320	1782320	He hasn't been.
1782320	1789320	You really think the lie he'd pick to tell would be, I used to catch seagulls as a teenager?
1789320	1791320	Yeah, he does.
1791320	1793320	I was a teenager.
1793320	1796320	So, you're three quarters covered in sand, but...
1796320	1797320	Thank you.
1797320	1798320	Yes.
1798320	1801320	But you have a towel covering you that looks like...
1801320	1805320	Someone just tucked you in like you're in bed with a towel over you.
1805320	1806320	Buried up to your waist.
1806320	1807320	Over my head.
1807320	1808320	Over your head.
1808320	1810320	And stomach.
1810320	1816320	Again, you're declarifying the situation.
1816320	1823320	Legs, feet, knees, dick, stomach, maybe right under my tits.
1823320	1824320	You know, that's where it stops.
1824320	1828320	But laying, yeah, under sand, under beach level.
1828320	1830320	The rest of it is underneath the towel.
1830320	1831320	Okay.
1831320	1833320	Arms exposed underneath the towel.
1833320	1835320	No, arms are under the towel.
1835320	1838320	Jesus Christ.
1838320	1839320	Okay, so look.
1839320	1840320	See this?
1840320	1841320	You see this part?
1841320	1842320	Yeah.
1842320	1847320	All of this that you see is under a towel because beach towels are very large.
1847320	1849320	They could cover this whole area.
1849320	1851320	It's amazing.
1851320	1852320	So...
1852320	1855320	He's Googled that.
1855320	1861320	With the beach towel over your face, you get someone like a brother or a friend to put food out on the towel.
1861320	1866320	And scattered around, you know, because it's very suspicious.
1866320	1869320	Especially to seagulls.
1869320	1871320	Because they've been hurt before.
1871320	1872320	Right.
1872320	1874320	Because I do it all the time.
1874320	1876320	I did it all the time.
1876320	1879320	So, yeah, with the food in place, you just wait.
1879320	1883320	And then, you know, you hear them squawking and you hear them flapping around.
1883320	1884320	Don't yell at me.
1884320	1885320	I have a question.
1885320	1886320	Okay.
1886320	1890320	Is your head above the towel?
1890320	1893320	I'm not going to answer that because...
1893320	1894320	He's covered.
1894320	1897320	So, he's trying to be in disguise from the seagull.
1897320	1898320	So, he's covered.
1898320	1900320	So, nobody in the van is showing.
1900320	1902320	So, he's got a towel over his...
1902320	1907320	I was just thinking maybe part of the fun was that they don't regard a head as a threat.
1907320	1909320	The fun is catching a seagull.
1909320	1912320	It's not gaslighting them.
1912320	1919320	The fun is watching a guy in lost in his...
1919320	1922320	The fun is physically catching a seagull.
1922320	1924320	Yeah, that's the whole point.
1924320	1929320	Not mentally circumscribing it with semiotics.
1929320	1930320	All right.
1930320	1931320	And drooping itself.
1931320	1933320	Okay, so I think we all have the visual now.
1933320	1934320	I don't think Dan has...
1934320	1935320	Well, I don't.
1935320	1938320	The truth is I don't.
1938320	1941320	And there may be a problem with society where at a certain point...
1941320	1942320	Just hold up.
1942320	1945320	Just fuck it up.
1945320	1946320	All right.
1946320	1947320	Like this.
1947320	1948320	Where's the sand?
1948320	1950320	The sand goes up to here.
1950320	1951320	Not my chest.
1951320	1952320	Do you see?
1952320	1953320	This is the chest.
1953320	1954320	Okay.
1954320	1955320	But is the...
1955320	1956320	I have questions.
1956320	1957320	I know you think I'm doing a bit, but I swear I have questions.
1957320	1960320	Can you imagine a towel fitting...
1960320	1963320	No.
1963320	1966320	Okay.
1966320	1968320	Okay.
1968320	1970320	And the rest of it is a mound?
1970320	1971320	The rest of it is a mound?
1971320	1972320	Yeah.
1972320	1973320	Is that below sand level?
1973320	1976320	Well, half and half.
1976320	1980320	You make a little shallow grave and then you slip into it and then you do this.
1980320	1981320	See, right.
1981320	1985320	If you were a seagull, you didn't know there was a boy pretending to be at the beach.
1985320	1986320	Yeah, that's the whole point.
1986320	1988320	That's all I'm doing.
1988320	1992320	It's tricking them into thinking I'm not there.
1992320	1993320	All right.
1993320	1994320	I should get up.
1994320	1995320	You get it, right?
1995320	1996320	Does this make sense yet?
1996320	1998320	So as long as you're down there, take us through the process.
1998320	1999320	All right.
1999320	2001320	So I'm laying here and the seagull...
2001320	2003320	And your brother or friend, as you said...
2003320	2004320	Or friend, yes.
2004320	2006320	...has put chips around your head.
2006320	2007320	Uh-huh.
2007320	2008320	Okay.
2008320	2009320	Like, yeah.
2009320	2010320	It's on my head.
2010320	2013320	Real quick, Josh, I think I'd want the guy to have a bigger dick.
2013320	2014320	All right.
2014320	2015320	Go ahead.
2015320	2016320	Just soap it.
2016320	2018320	Did you think about the shower when you thought about it?
2018320	2019320	Because I want to wash it, dude.
2019320	2020320	I figured it out.
2020320	2021320	It's all about the soaping.
2021320	2022320	Yeah.
2022320	2026320	It becomes like a Cadillac or a bicycle or anything you treasure.
2026320	2027320	It's festive.
2027320	2028320	A throwing knife.
2028320	2029320	A new blender.
2029320	2030320	I don't care.
2030320	2031320	It's like...
2031320	2032320	I just...
2032320	2033320	I had this epiphany where I was like, wait.
2033320	2034320	All right.
2034320	2035320	All right.
2035320	2036320	Come on, Spencer.
2043320	2044320	Hey, guys.
2044320	2045320	All right.
2045320	2047320	We don't take it for granted.
2051320	2052320	That was so awesome.
2052320	2055320	I'm not even going to bother to describe that to the listeners.
2055320	2056320	Yeah.
2056320	2061320	Five dollars a month to see the coolest exit of all time.
2061320	2063320	Probably a lot of theatrical people in the audience.
2063320	2066320	Spencer returned to his one.
2066320	2067320	All right.
2067320	2068320	So Spencer...
2068320	2069320	Blocking.
2069320	2070320	Okay.
2070320	2071320	So Spencer, now you are partially sandy.
2071320	2073320	You're partially tolled.
2073320	2074320	You got bits of food.
2074320	2076320	You got like French fries and whatnot on top of you.
2076320	2078320	The seagulls are swooping in.
2078320	2081320	And now we're hearing the seagulls coming in now.
2081320	2082320	Because my eyes are covered.
2082320	2083320	I don't see what's happening.
2083320	2085320	I have to rely on my ears and my sense of touch.
2085320	2089320	But now your sense of hearing is heightened now because you can't see it.
2089320	2090320	Oh, of course.
2090320	2092320	I mean, without question.
2092320	2093320	That goes without saying.
2093320	2095320	So I'm doing that.
2095320	2096320	It's a feeding frenzy.
2096320	2097320	They're suspicious.
2097320	2104320	However, will any sensory gift, even the score between you and the most dangerous game of all,
2104320	2111320	a confused, slightly domesticated, urban-pliked parasite?
2111320	2112320	All right.
2112320	2114320	They're real parasites.
2114320	2116320	They're everywhere in California.
2116320	2117320	It's terrible.
2117320	2118320	Anyway.
2118320	2119320	So they're coming in.
2119320	2123320	You feel them getting up on your chest and or body.
2123320	2128320	And you get, they got to get like right on your head area just because that's the center
2128320	2131320	of your bear trap action.
2131320	2136320	So your arms are out-crucifix-style so you can close them like a bear trap.
2136320	2137320	Yes, I got you.
2137320	2138320	Yes.
2139320	2144320	So once, you know, and you got to wait because they know it's something's up.
2144320	2145320	Right.
2145320	2150320	Because again, there's like a giant lump under a towel and they're stupid, but it looks weird
2150320	2151320	and they know that.
2151320	2152320	So, okay.
2152320	2153320	So you're being patient.
2153320	2158320	They're like, is this how I die or is this the first day of the rest of my life?
2158320	2159320	Right.
2159320	2162320	Those potato chips on a decorative mound.
2162320	2163320	Yeah.
2163320	2164320	Because usually...
2164320	2165320	In a semi-circular pattern.
2165320	2166320	Yeah.
2166320	2167320	Around a beardy...
2167320	2168320	Yes.
2168320	2169320	Beardy bulge.
2169320	2170320	I didn't have a beard.
2170320	2174320	And a bunch of other humans kind of in the middle distance.
2174320	2175320	Watch.
2175320	2176320	Like giggling.
2176320	2177320	Yeah.
2177320	2178320	Yeah.
2178320	2179320	Because it's a big, like it draws a crowd, certainly.
2179320	2180320	Yeah.
2180320	2181320	Especially after the first couple of times.
2181320	2186320	People overselling a purely, a transparently perfunctural game of hacky sack as they clearly
2186320	2189320	are more invested in the towel.
2190320	2194320	So they're getting up on my face and I'm waiting for my moment.
2194320	2196320	And then I, you know, I do what I did.
2196320	2197320	I go...
2197320	2201320	And then, you know, you use the towel as a crude net and then you just try and grab as
2201320	2203320	many as you can.
2204320	2207320	Is that the end or is that phase one?
2208320	2209320	Yeah.
2209320	2210320	That's phase one.
2210320	2213320	And once you have 200, you can fly away.
2215320	2217320	No, it's just for fun.
2218320	2221320	I mean, do you keep them as pets?
2221320	2222320	Do you let them go?
2222320	2223320	Are you like that?
2223320	2226320	No, I snap their necks and toss them into the sea.
2227320	2228320	I believe that.
2232320	2233320	No, so it's just for fun.
2233320	2234320	I don't know.
2234320	2235320	I don't know.
2235320	2238320	I couldn't tell you what my end game was other than catching seagulls.
2238320	2241320	Does it, does it, does it, doesn't hurt them, does it?
2241320	2242320	I hope not.
2242320	2245320	I mean, I never saw them maimed or anything like they all flew away.
2245320	2249320	You said two things that stick out about the story is that you would find that as you
2249320	2251320	did this, people would root for you while you were doing it.
2251320	2252320	Right.
2252320	2253320	But then once you were successful...
2253320	2259320	Once I had a seagull in my grasp, it became this whole big animal rights issue.
2261320	2264320	And then you said you stopped after the experience you had.
2264320	2265320	Yeah.
2265320	2268320	So one of the times, I've probably caught about five seagulls this way.
2268320	2270320	It takes a lot of tries.
2270320	2272320	They were calling you old, old gold...
2272320	2273320	Old wispy arms.
2273320	2274320	Gold reaver.
2274320	2275320	Gold reaver.
2275320	2276320	They called you a gold reaver.
2276320	2277320	Gold reaver.
2277320	2278320	All right.
2278320	2279320	I like that.
2279320	2280320	Did you invent...
2280320	2281320	Like, is this something you...
2281320	2283320	Did you invent this or did the guy that...
2283320	2284320	He invented it.
2284320	2285320	Did he?
2285320	2289320	I think he got the idea from a Metallica album.
2289320	2291320	I'm certain I didn't invent it.
2291320	2292320	There's no way.
2292320	2293320	This is getting gals.
2293320	2296320	If it was like a bigger brother, this seems like the kind of thing where it's like, I'm
2296320	2301960	going to tell my little brother, I'm going to fucking bury him in a beach and get a crowd
2301960	2302960	around.
2302960	2303960	Was there like a hat?
2304600	2305600	No.
2305600	2306600	To like...
2306600	2307600	You know what I mean?
2307600	2308600	Was he...
2308600	2309600	Were you busking by accident?
2309600	2310600	I wish.
2310600	2311600	No.
2311600	2312600	I could have made a lot.
2312600	2315320	Because, I mean, the crowds cannot be understated.
2315320	2317480	You know, it was hard to hear...
2317480	2318480	There's no...
2318480	2322280	There is no overstating the throngs of people.
2322280	2323280	Yeah.
2323280	2324280	It was hard to hear the seagulls.
2324280	2325280	That throng.
2325280	2326280	I'm on their hoots and hollers.
2326280	2327280	Salbang.
2327280	2328280	Worried about the seagull.
2328280	2329280	Well, not yet.
2329280	2330280	Well, not yet.
2330280	2331280	Just crying.
2331280	2332280	They're more like...
2332280	2333280	Like thunderdome.
2333280	2335400	They're like climbing up on things and like...
2335400	2341560	I thought you were going to say, I thought you were saying, there is no business like
2341560	2343120	seagull catching business.
2343120	2344120	Anyways.
2344120	2345120	All right.
2345120	2346120	So, all right.
2346120	2347120	But this leads somewhere.
2347120	2348120	This is the Michael Crichton twist.
2348120	2350640	Again, I've only probably caught five.
2350640	2351640	It's not easy to do.
2351640	2353640	Seasoned the goal catcher though.
2353640	2354640	Yeah.
2354640	2361360	So, one time I got one and yeah, I caught it and he was flapping around, you know, and
2361360	2366200	I like got him by his body so he couldn't flap away and he's starting to like attack
2366200	2367200	at me.
2367200	2369640	He's biting at me and he tries to peck.
2369640	2371800	He tries to peck my eye out.
2371800	2375680	He goes wha-bam with his beak right at my eye.
2375680	2379800	And at the last second, the last fifth is a second I'll say.
2379800	2380800	Very short period of time.
2380800	2382240	Like it was very close.
2382240	2387720	It opens its beak and I can see down its throat.
2387720	2393480	And I got scars, little tiny scars up here and then down here, above and below my eye
2393480	2397880	to prove that this was a dangerous beak that could peck an eye out.
2397880	2398880	But didn't.
2398880	2402800	And I swear to God, it was just because of like Jesus or something that I didn't have
2402800	2404320	my eye pecked out that day.
2404320	2413560	Or the devil because if I had an eye patch and a beard, holy shit, look out.
2413560	2418080	If you had an eye patch, if you had an eye patch, you and Lee could really, this would
2418080	2420320	be a great pirate movie.
2420320	2425080	Archering, doing so much archery.
2425080	2430920	Do you prefer the seagulls to have a bigger or smaller beak than you?
2430920	2433280	Definitely real big.
2433280	2438800	I like that in Spencer's universe, it's possible the devil was responsible because it left
2438800	2441480	him without an eye patch.
2441480	2444120	And the devil in your universe is just...
2444120	2447440	He wants me to look less ridiculous.
2447440	2449520	He's just bad at marketing, right?
2449520	2454640	The devil is like, he's chaos, he doesn't package things right.
2454640	2456360	But so he's biting and pecking around.
2456360	2458000	I mean, this story kind of trails off here.
2458000	2462440	But then I, so I stuffed my finger in his mouth so he can't like bite or peck.
2462440	2466720	And at that point, like kids were coming up and wanted to pet him and people were getting
2466720	2470000	mad and say, you shouldn't do that.
2470000	2473720	And then eventually I just let it go because it's like, you know, seagull doesn't want
2473720	2474720	to be there.
2474720	2476720	I don't know what to do with it.
2476720	2480600	Oh, you know, my parents told me that their family members did it.
2480600	2482200	That's how I got the idea.
2482200	2486120	Because one of them would tie a string around their foot and like kind of fly it around
2486120	2487120	for a while.
2487120	2488120	That's right.
2488120	2489120	But I never did that.
2489120	2490120	Jesus.
2490120	2491120	What kind of fucking weird heybelly shit.
2491120	2492120	Yeah, no, that's what I said.
2492120	2493120	I just absolutely...
2493120	2494120	But I never did that.
2494120	2495120	Yeah.
2495120	2497120	Yeah, no, I'm normal.
2498120	2500840	I'm not some weirdo.
2500840	2501840	But yeah.
2501840	2503800	And so people were petting it and then I let it go.
2503800	2504800	It was great.
2504800	2508480	But after that, it was just, I mean, it was very scary.
2508480	2509840	I was almost pecked out.
2509840	2513800	Like it should have been pecked out by all accounts because it was trying to bite and
2513800	2514800	peck at me.
2514800	2519560	You're going to have a hard time turning this into like a sob story for you.
2519560	2520560	My own.
2520560	2521560	It was almost...
2521560	2522560	Yeah.
2522560	2523560	No, I mean, I don't want pity.
2523560	2527400	I love respect.
2527400	2530840	He doesn't want patrons or seagulls to pity him.
2530840	2532160	He wants them to fear him.
2532160	2533160	Right.
2533160	2534160	Hey, Jeff.
2534160	2541160	What if there was a beer commercial that Sam Elliott was doing a voiceover for and...
2541160	2543160	A beer commercial?
2543160	2544160	And it involved...
2544160	2549880	Or, well, I didn't want to pimp you and say, can Sam Elliott sell seagull catching.
2549880	2551760	But I like your Sam Elliott impression.
2552760	2553760	I see.
2553760	2558760	But it could be like a beer that they're using seagull catching the way that a beer might be.
2558760	2565920	Well, I'm Sam Elliott for the 2017 Seagull Catching Competition.
2565920	2569800	This year it's in Australia at Bondi Beach.
2569800	2570800	But they don't have...
2570800	2571800	You have seagulls here, right?
2571800	2572800	Yeah.
2572800	2573800	Yeah.
2573800	2574800	But fuck seagulls.
2574800	2576800	We're going to kill a bunch of those greasy-ass Ibises.
2582760	2584760	Fuck Ibises.
2584760	2586760	Those things are gross.
2586760	2588760	I mean, I saw one in the park.
2588760	2590760	What's the Hyde Park, right?
2590760	2593760	A crazy-ass, like, awesome, exotic bird.
2593760	2595760	And then they were just...
2595760	2597760	They're just, like, raccoons.
2597760	2600760	They're just in the trash and they're all covered in shit.
2600760	2603760	They sound like somebody punched a baby.
2605760	2608760	Can you tell me who Sam Elliott is?
2608760	2610760	Do you ever see...
2610760	2611760	Okay.
2611760	2613760	Do you ever see, uh, Big Lebowski?
2613760	2614760	We're all friends here.
2614760	2616760	Did you see Big Lebowski, Josh?
2616760	2617760	No.
2617760	2618760	No.
2618760	2619760	Did you see Mask with Cher?
2619760	2622760	Well, I think probably if you keep listing things that he's in,
2622760	2624760	that I'm going to keep saying no.
2627760	2629760	Well, obviously it's still no.
2629760	2631760	No, he's a character actor who has a big mustache.
2631760	2632760	Okay, I'm sorry.
2632760	2633760	Okay.
2633760	2634760	Yeah.
2634760	2635760	It's just...
2635760	2636760	It's a good impression, I guess.
2636760	2637760	No.
2637760	2638760	I've done better.
2638760	2640760	I was struggling with the material.
2640760	2641760	That was a hard...
2641760	2642760	That was a curveball.
2642760	2644760	Yeah, I didn't set him up to succeed.
2644760	2645760	I trust him, though.
2645760	2646760	You know, it's not great.
2646760	2648760	I mean, it was...
2648760	2649760	Sam Elliott.
2649760	2650760	I mean...
2650760	2651760	Sam Elliott.
2651760	2653760	Okay, Josh, there's one line from a movie called Frogs.
2653760	2655760	It's a terrible movie with him and Ray Malant.
2655760	2656760	Yeah.
2656760	2658760	And on the poster of the movie Frogs,
2658760	2661760	there's a frog the size of a Volkswagen Beetle
2661760	2663760	with a human arm hanging out of its mouth.
2663760	2664760	Okay.
2664760	2667760	And that doesn't happen in the movie.
2667760	2669760	There's never giant frogs.
2669760	2671760	In fact, most of the frogs aren't even in the movie
2671760	2672760	because when they shot this movie,
2672760	2674760	they had a bunch of frogs brought in on the set.
2674760	2675760	They let him out.
2675760	2676760	And guess what?
2676760	2679760	The frogs just fucked off into the night.
2679760	2683760	And so while they're shooting the movie, guess what?
2683760	2684760	They're two things.
2684760	2685760	They don't have frogs.
2685760	2686760	Yeah.
2686760	2688760	But you could hear a million frogs.
2688760	2693760	So they had audio issues and third-act problems.
2693760	2695760	Well, as long as you have Sam Elliott,
2695760	2696760	you can get through that.
2696760	2698760	Sam Elliott doesn't have a mustache in this one.
2698760	2700760	And you kind of see why he always has the mustache.
2700760	2703760	He's got kind of a weird lip that hangs down real far like that.
2703760	2706760	You never saw Tombstone with Kurt Russell?
2706760	2707760	So what we...
2707760	2708760	I don't know if I can repeat this again.
2708760	2710760	Anything you mention with Sam Elliott in it,
2710760	2711760	I haven't seen.
2711760	2712760	Okay.
2712760	2714760	I'm going to do what I say is a fairly okay impression
2714760	2717760	of Sam Elliott doing one line from the movie Frogs,
2717760	2719760	Sam Elliott and Ray Malant.
2719760	2723760	I don't think we're going to see any of them again.
2723760	2725760	Not alive, anyway.
2729760	2731760	And, awesomely, if you can find it,
2731760	2734760	because Rob Schwab has the VHS of it,
2734760	2739760	the trailer, it's the worst syntax like sentence structure.
2739760	2742760	He goes, frogs is coming.
2747760	2749760	And there's a big-ass frog in the poster you never see.
2749760	2750760	It's a fucking bunch.
2750760	2754760	It's frogs if it's the animal are coming,
2754760	2756760	but if it's frogs the name of the movie,
2756760	2757760	then it is coming.
2757760	2759760	Frogs is coming to a theater to you,
2759760	2760760	but it doesn't work.
2760760	2762760	Yeah, it doesn't.
2762760	2766760	Birds is coming.
2766760	2771760	They thought it was going to be the birds of amphibians.
2771760	2774760	Spencer, what would your tactic be to catch a wild frog?
2774760	2775760	Oh, no.
2775760	2777760	You go out in the rain.
2777760	2779760	They always come out in the rain.
2781760	2783760	But they're easy to catch.
2783760	2787760	I dated a girl very briefly who was Italian,
2787760	2790760	and her family was supposedly in the mob,
2790760	2794760	and she had for real an Uncle Vinny, Uncle Vince,
2794760	2797760	and he was a real lunatic.
2797760	2800760	He was a property manager in an apartment building.
2800760	2803760	He slept with a .357 under his pillow loaded,
2803760	2807760	and when he would see pigeons in his backyard
2807760	2809760	at the apartment complex,
2809760	2811760	he would catch them in a pillowcase,
2811760	2813760	tie the pillowcase in a knot,
2813760	2815760	and throw it in the pool.
2815760	2816760	All right.
2816760	2817760	Well, let's just...
2817760	2818760	He's jealous.
2818760	2821760	Why didn't I think of that?
2821760	2822760	All right.
2822760	2825760	So, getting back to Australian politics.
2828760	2830760	Josh, before I go...
2830760	2834760	I only have so much more time where I care about this stuff.
2834760	2837760	I have Australian questions that I couldn't Google.
2837760	2839760	Is there a president?
2839760	2841760	There is, right?
2841760	2842760	And there's none.
2842760	2843760	Okay.
2843760	2844760	But there's a prime minister.
2844760	2845760	That's a prime minister.
2845760	2846760	But then there's something else.
2846760	2847760	The states have premiers.
2847760	2848760	A queen?
2848760	2850760	Oh, but the queen is just the queen of England, right?
2850760	2851760	Yeah.
2852760	2853760	Okay.
2853760	2854760	Okay.
2854760	2856760	I think he was asking me.
2856760	2857760	Okay.
2857760	2860760	I've got a covet.
2860760	2861760	I've got a covet.
2861760	2865760	I've got a prime minister who is, like, the head of the country.
2865760	2866760	And then there's the governor general.
2866760	2868760	But he doesn't do or she, I guess.
2868760	2869760	Doesn't do nothing.
2869760	2870760	You're welcome, ladies.
2870760	2872760	So that guy wants me to...
2872760	2875760	So, prime minister is...
2875760	2879760	Those other people are, like, they're federal.
2879760	2881760	They're Australia-wide.
2881760	2882760	What?
2882760	2883760	Their office is...
2883760	2884760	The government?
2884760	2887760	Yeah, it's Australia-wide.
2887760	2888760	I mean, it's not...
2888760	2889760	You're not described.
2889760	2890760	These offices aren't state-level.
2890760	2891760	They're...
2891760	2892760	They're the same.
2892760	2897760	You guys have, like, your electoral states and then there's people.
2897760	2898760	It's the same.
2898760	2899760	Don't worry about it.
2899760	2900760	All right, don't worry about it.
2900760	2901760	It's just we have, like...
2901760	2903760	We have Donald Trumpet.
2903760	2904760	She's a woman.
2904760	2905760	Pauline Henson.
2905760	2906760	And she's not as popular.
2906760	2907760	Yeah.
2907760	2908760	But she's so pretty popular.
2908760	2909760	Yeah.
2909760	2911760	But I could get through every show by shitting on her for a half hour.
2911760	2912760	Yeah.
2912760	2913760	Fuck Pauline Henson.
2913760	2914760	Yeah.
2914760	2918760	I learned to rip that hang glider first night in Brisbane, man.
2918760	2919760	I was like...
2919760	2920760	Well, they love her in Brisbane.
2920760	2923760	Well, not to say anything bad about Pauline Henson in Brisbane.
2923760	2924760	Not my fans, no.
2924760	2925760	Were they laughing?
2925760	2926760	Very nervously.
2926760	2927760	They were still.
2927760	2928760	They were still.
2928760	2929760	They were still.
2929760	2930760	They were still.
2930760	2931760	Oh, shit.
2931760	2932760	You're correct, like Pauline.
2932760	2933760	I'm from Brisbane and I'm not going to argue with you.
2933760	2934760	Do you like her?
2934760	2935760	Yeah.
2935760	2937760	I don't like her, but Brisbane likes her.
2937760	2940760	We're not going to pretend, like, Brisbane's not racist.
2940760	2943760	I'm not going to sit here, like, you're a person.
2943760	2944760	I'm a person.
2944760	2945760	We're looking at each other's eyes.
2945760	2947760	All I can see is black, but you can see my eyes.
2947760	2949760	I lied to each other.
2949760	2950760	Brisbane is racist.
2950760	2953760	Don't give me that.
2953760	2955760	It definitely is.
2955760	2956760	Yeah.
2956760	2957760	We're not...
2957760	2958760	Hello.
2958760	2959760	We lived there.
2959760	2960760	I lived there.
2960760	2961760	I lived there.
2961760	2964760	I left because they're so racist.
2964760	2965760	You left.
2965760	2966760	You're here.
2969760	2970760	They don't...
2970760	2972760	It's day of fucking ripping.
2972760	2973760	Oh, shit.
2973760	2975760	Oh, fuck.
2975760	2976760	See?
2976760	2978760	I hate others.
2979760	2981760	They can't be tolerant.
2981760	2983760	We were in Brisbane and there...
2983760	2984760	There wasn't a single part...
2984760	2987760	When we landed on Ipswich, everyone was, like,
2987760	2990760	they were stoked about shitting on Ipswich.
2990760	2992760	I would love to do a show on Ipswich before we leave here
2992760	2996760	just to verify that this is all a cycle of bullshit.
2996760	2997760	Because, like, there...
2997760	2999760	We filled a theater there.
2999760	3001760	It was fucking weird and rowdy, but...
3001760	3003760	Did you actually do a gig in Ipswich?
3003760	3004760	Yeah.
3004760	3005760	And they were smart and great.
3005760	3006760	Brisbane, we did.
3006760	3007760	Brisbane.
3007760	3008760	No, no, no, I'm sorry.
3008760	3009760	I was too busy answering the question
3009760	3011760	before you finished asking it.
3011760	3012760	I'm like, yeah!
3012760	3013760	Yeah.
3013760	3014760	No, we didn't do a show on Ipswich.
3014760	3017760	Fuck those fucking stump-humping rednecks.
3019760	3021760	I'll do anything to regain control.
3021760	3023760	What is wrong with you?
3023760	3024760	I know.
3024760	3026760	When they talk, you just say yes, ma'am,
3026760	3030760	and continue arguing with them.
3030760	3033760	Is this what you do on your gay TV show?
3034760	3036760	I can't believe it's legal.
3036760	3038760	Wait, is gay marriage legal here?
3038760	3039760	Oh, yeah.
3039760	3040760	What is this?
3040760	3041760	Yeah, I didn't think so.
3041760	3042760	It's not at all.
3042760	3043760	You can get arrested just for...
3043760	3044760	For getting married?
3044760	3045760	Arrested for getting married.
3045760	3046760	You just can't get...
3046760	3047760	It's just off the table.
3047760	3048760	Prison.
3048760	3050760	There's not these prisons filled with gay men
3050760	3052760	who try to get married who would then actually...
3052760	3054760	Well, this is the best luck I've ever had
3054760	3057760	stuck in prison.
3057760	3060760	It's not Singapore.
3060760	3062760	I never asked that question before.
3062760	3065760	All this conversation about gay marriage in America
3065760	3066760	was never like,
3066760	3067760	well, they're not going to arrest people
3067760	3068760	if they get married, right?
3068760	3069760	But no, yeah, you just can't get a license to live.
3069760	3070760	No, they just won't.
3070760	3071760	You'd just be like,
3071760	3072760	I'm going to get married.
3072760	3073760	They'd be like, no.
3073760	3074760	Don't go and get married.
3074760	3075760	You can't have like...
3075760	3078760	That's a shame because that's how weddings became romantic
3078760	3080760	before they were arranged,
3080760	3081760	and then it became romantic,
3081760	3083760	the idea that you'd slip off into the woods
3083760	3085760	with a priest who would say,
3085760	3087760	you two in this forest clearing among your friends,
3087760	3088760	like you're...
3088760	3089760	This is official.
3090760	3092760	Marriage became like a sacred thing
3092760	3095760	that was about two people being into each other,
3095760	3096760	and it's funny.
3096760	3097760	It's funny.
3097760	3099760	What?
3099760	3102760	What happened in the forest with the priest?
3102760	3104760	You know, like Robin Hood times.
3104760	3105760	Like, come on.
3105760	3107760	Okay.
3107760	3110760	He thinks you go and fuck the priest in the woods.
3110760	3111760	Oh, no.
3111760	3112760	That's what I had.
3112760	3115760	In my head, you don't think it by a priest.
3115760	3118760	It's like the idea that the ceremony is romantic
3118760	3121760	that it's an expression of true love that has something other...
3121760	3123760	It has something to do with anything other than, like...
3123760	3124760	Government.
3124760	3125760	Government.
3125760	3126760	Yeah.
3126760	3127760	It's kind of ironic, isn't it?
3127760	3129760	Because it truly is a government...
3129760	3131760	Now you want the contract or something.
3131760	3132760	I don't know.
3132760	3134760	Well, because it's about health benefits now.
3134760	3135760	It's about being treated...
3135760	3136760	It's not my fault.
3136760	3138760	I just got swept up in the gay marriage thing.
3138760	3139760	There's nothing I can do about it here.
3139760	3140760	I am in the center of it.
3140760	3141760	They won't let me get married.
3141760	3144760	I have to feel passionate about it, but I don't really care.
3144760	3145760	I don't want to get married.
3145760	3146760	I've got a boyfriend.
3146760	3147760	Would you ever get married?
3147760	3149760	I have a gay commitment, so I'm like,
3149760	3152760	I'd vote for that, luck for that party.
3152760	3154760	But personally, that's not something you'd ever do.
3154760	3155760	It's not really.
3155760	3156760	Why do I want to get married?
3156760	3157760	Are you going to get married?
3157760	3158760	Your girlfriend's here.
3158760	3161760	I got married, and then I got divorced.
3161760	3162760	I don't think...
3162760	3164760	And now I'm in love.
3164760	3165760	Like, I...
3165760	3166760	It's...
3166760	3167760	It...
3167760	3168760	It...
3168760	3169760	It...
3169760	3172760	I think you reacted wrong.
3172760	3175760	I'm not going to...
3176760	3177760	I understand.
3177760	3182760	I can connect those dots, but you're making candor difficult,
3182760	3185760	and that makes you the bad people.
3185760	3187760	I'm going to stick with that.
3187760	3191760	It doesn't seem very romantic to me to sign a contract that says
3191760	3192760	I'm going to love you forever.
3192760	3194760	That just seems a bit fucked.
3194760	3196760	So can you agree of my observation of the irony,
3196760	3198760	drunk as I am, that it's like, that's the thing?
3198760	3199760	Like, it's not romantic.
3199760	3200760	The...
3200760	3201760	It's horrible.
3201760	3203760	The exact issues that make it a political issue.
3203760	3204760	I'm going to love you forever.
3204760	3207760	That morning, don't decide ten years ago.
3207760	3208760	No?
3208760	3210760	I hate the idea of waking up next to someone
3210760	3212760	and they've signed some...
3212760	3214760	Yeah, if it becomes a legal document, then it's just a legal document.
3214760	3217760	But still, I have to go to the rallies and...
3217760	3219760	I think we're on the same page, I think.
3219760	3223760	Because we're equal, and we're equal to you,
3223760	3224760	and that's important.
3224760	3225760	Lee, are you going to get married?
3225760	3227760	Are you a married type?
3227760	3229760	He's talking me out of it.
3229760	3230760	What?
3230760	3231760	I'm not going to marry you.
3231760	3233760	She's freaking out.
3233760	3234760	Is that your girlfriend?
3234760	3235760	It is.
3236760	3239760	Oh, shit.
3239760	3240760	Maybe you should propose right now.
3240760	3243760	What a beautiful opportunity.
3243760	3244760	Pull the trigger, Lee.
3244760	3246760	Pull the goddamn trigger.
3246760	3249760	The tech team is not playing songbird.
3249760	3253760	You could get down on your knee and make her so happy.
3253760	3255760	Why don't you want to make her happy?
3255760	3256760	Ally and Lee.
3256760	3257760	Make her happy.
3257760	3258760	Have you guys ever discussed it?
3258760	3259760	You guys talk about it,
3259760	3261760	or is it something that you guys never talk about?
3261760	3262760	I feel like I'm being bullied.
3262760	3263760	That's all I can say.
3264760	3265760	You know, being bullied,
3265760	3268760	the woman that you love is sitting in front of a thousand people
3268760	3270760	saying, why won't you keep me forever?
3270760	3272760	And you're saying, because you're a witch.
3274760	3275760	That's what I saw.
3275760	3277760	Is that what you saw?
3277760	3281760	Well, I'm looking at my coats.
3283760	3287760	What a beautiful opportunity to make a lovely moment.
3287760	3288760	Who's with me?
3293760	3294760	I'm so sorry.
3294760	3296760	So there's no president in Australia.
3296760	3298760	I don't even know if I meant to acknowledge you.
3298760	3302760	Did you know that, what I learned today is that penguins propose,
3302760	3303760	they propose to each other,
3303760	3307760	the male brings the smoothest rock he can find up to the female penguin.
3307760	3308760	We didn't learn this together.
3308760	3310760	No, I'm telling you.
3310760	3311760	Oh, I think I got away with that.
3311760	3313760	We went to the aquarium.
3313760	3314760	What do you mean they propose to each other?
3314760	3317760	That's what it said on the sign outside the penguin cage
3317760	3319760	at what Jeff calls the fish prison.
3319760	3321760	How do they propose?
3321760	3323760	The penguins are fucking fish jails.
3323760	3325760	I'm not going to fucking fish jail.
3325760	3329760	They get to swim in the fucking biggest part of our planet
3329760	3332760	and we go, fuck it, get in the box.
3332760	3336760	So we can look at you like perverse fucking cynical douchebags.
3336760	3338760	Yeah, a lot of those tanks are pretty small.
3338760	3341760	There are some that are pretty big size, but a lot of them were small.
3341760	3345760	Yeah, we know how much you hate it when people hunt animals.
3348760	3350760	Again, I never hurt them.
3351760	3356760	You certainly provoke them into attacking their eyeballs.
3356760	3358760	Well, if you're going to put them in such a small box,
3358760	3362760	why not rustle them up a bit so we can get some excitement?
3362760	3363760	Yes, right.
3363760	3367760	Spencer Zoo, just people half buried with towels.
3368760	3371760	I thought we'd have the laptop again tonight
3371760	3373760	that I could show a video that I took at the aquarium
3373760	3375760	because it was the strangest thing.
3375760	3379760	One of the big tanks, the big giant wall tanks,
3379760	3382760	a bunch of fish floating in it, and there's staircases.
3382760	3385760	And then there was this upper middle-aged guy.
3385760	3388760	I'm going to put him at, let's say, 60 to 65.
3388760	3390760	He's a tourist from some Asian country.
3390760	3392760	I'm being racist by saying that. He was Asian.
3392760	3394760	He had a baseball cap on, a windbreaker,
3394760	3398760	kind of seemed middle-class, 65-year-old guy.
3398760	3400760	And his equally aged wife approached the thing,
3400760	3404760	and then they exchanged words that were in their native language.
3404760	3405760	It was too dark.
3405760	3408760	I'm not going to speculate what of the thousand Asian countries they were from.
3408760	3411760	I just keep calling them Asian.
3411760	3415760	I also don't see the world through that lens, so I don't know what.
3415760	3419760	But to me, it is important that there was a certain kind of thing happening here.
3419760	3421760	So it is important.
3421760	3423760	Their cheekbones were just so narrative.
3423760	3426760	You say there was 65, but how do you know?
3426760	3430760	They exchanged words, and they had shopping bags.
3430760	3433760	They were very touristy, and we were in front of this, like,
3433760	3436760	what is the problem there? What is that?
3437760	3439760	Because we toasted our drinks?
3439760	3442760	Oh, God. I thought I was stumbling into the realization
3442760	3446760	that there was an Asian stereotype about shopping bags.
3446760	3449760	And I got mad at them, even though I projected that.
3449760	3452760	I was like, fuck you, people.
3452760	3455760	And then I was like, no, that's the first thought you had, racist.
3455760	3456760	Okay.
3456760	3459760	They were reacting to something other than me and my race,
3459760	3461760	which will one day rule the earth.
3461760	3463760	One day.
3467760	3470760	Yeah, one day.
3475760	3477760	She exchanged words with him,
3477760	3480760	and then he went up to the giant fish tank,
3480760	3482760	and she hung behind with her camera,
3482760	3486760	and he raised his hands like this, facing her,
3486760	3489760	like he's gesturing the fish behind him.
3489760	3491760	And then the whole time they're speaking a language,
3491760	3493760	and I don't speak, but she's going up to him,
3493760	3495760	and she says more stuff to him.
3495760	3498760	And then he turns around, and he holds his arms up.
3498760	3503760	And she kept, and it went on for a full five minutes.
3503760	3505760	My girlfriend and I started watching it,
3505760	3506760	and we didn't exchange a word.
3506760	3508760	We didn't even really look at each other,
3508760	3510760	because it was like we were just watching them.
3510760	3512760	And then we started to get in the moment
3512760	3514760	of them being so out of the moment that they were in the moment,
3514760	3516760	because she had so many opinions
3516760	3518760	about how you're supposed to hold your arms
3518760	3521760	when you pose in front of a wall of fish.
3521760	3525760	And there was no toxicity between them that we could tell.
3525760	3526760	I mean, we don't know.
3526760	3529760	There could be the least healthy relationship in all of Earth,
3529760	3530760	or it could be the most healthy.
3530760	3531760	There was no way of telling.
3531760	3533760	We were just watching two people,
3533760	3537760	and they were like connected by some weird, perpetually
3537760	3541760	dissatisfied telepathy, because they were like,
3541760	3544760	he never thought it was weird that she just kept making them,
3544760	3546760	and she kept adjusting them.
3546760	3550760	And I took a video of it because they play like John Williams music
3550760	3552760	when you're going through the aquarium,
3552760	3554760	because they want to let you know fish are majestic,
3554760	3557760	because otherwise you'd be like, they're in a tank.
3557760	3558760	It's depressing.
3558760	3560760	So they play a lot of music that's like sweeping strings
3560760	3565760	and like Shawshank Redemption, but after he gets out.
3565760	3569760	And it's like sweeping music playing over these speakers.
3569760	3573760	And we spent five minutes watching this couple
3573760	3578760	that had merged into some weird two-fish school together,
3578760	3580760	like doing this weird thing.
3580760	3582760	And then we were like holding each other
3582760	3585760	because it was so weirdly adorable and frightening.
3585760	3589760	And then I took out my video camera, and I still got this perfect,
3589760	3592760	like there was this orchestral score going,
3592760	3596760	and then you finally realize she hasn't taken a single picture.
3596760	3598760	She's been like adjusting his arms,
3598760	3600760	and he's never asked any questions,
3600760	3602760	and he's just waiting patiently.
3602760	3605760	He's not stoked, but he's not ever getting mad.
3605760	3607760	He's just like, she wants this picture,
3607760	3609760	and she just like kept adjusting him,
3609760	3611760	and then she took one fucking picture.
3611760	3613760	It was like seven minutes went by,
3613760	3616760	and I think she only ever took one picture.
3616760	3618760	And then they gathered their stuff and walked away,
3618760	3621760	and I kind of wept a little bit and held my girlfriend.
3621760	3623760	I don't know what the point of my story was.
3623760	3625760	I wanted to show the video, so you got fucked.
3625760	3627760	My point of this is when he takes pictures of me,
3627760	3629760	he's telling me to adjust my face,
3629760	3632760	and then after a while it's like, oh, you just don't like my face?
3632760	3636760	Yeah, why don't you show me a picture of the guy you wish you were with,
3636760	3640760	and I'll take it to the stylist.
3640760	3641760	Brother, I know.
3641760	3644760	How long have you been together with the boyfriend?
3644760	3645760	Five years.
3645760	3646760	Five fucking years?
3646760	3647760	Yeah, okay.
3647760	3648760	Well done.
3648760	3649760	Why are you so surprised?
3649760	3651760	They said it wouldn't last.
3651760	3653760	Because they're both Josh's.
3653760	3655760	His name is Josh.
3655760	3657760	What?
3657760	3658760	His name is Josh.
3658760	3659760	He used to be Josh.
3659760	3662760	I got him to change him.
3662760	3665760	I thought they went aw because it was like a brief realization of like,
3665760	3668760	well, as if we didn't already have a long list of how cute it would be to be gay.
3668760	3670760	You could both be Josh's.
3670760	3672760	You can't do that in a lesbian couple.
3672760	3674760	A lesbian couple, you can.
3674760	3676760	You can't both be Josh's, but you can both be Sarah's.
3676760	3677760	No, you can't both be Josh's.
3677760	3678760	That's not as good to you.
3678760	3680760	Both be Matilda's or both be...
3680760	3683760	It was a simple observation.
3683760	3686760	Only in a gay male couple can you have two Josh's.
3686760	3687760	It's true.
3687760	3691760	We don't notice the simple things.
3691760	3694760	Does the other Josh have a micro penis?
3694760	3695760	He has a great...
3695760	3697760	He's just that.
3697760	3700760	Did you hear him behind the curtain?
3703760	3705760	Get him out here.
3705760	3707760	Other Josh, I think we need to exploit you.
3707760	3708760	Can you come stand out?
3708760	3710760	He has a nice penis.
3710760	3712760	He has a good...
3712760	3716760	Other Josh, show the crowd your penis and let's just move on.
3716760	3718760	Can we just move on from this?
3718760	3719760	Baby, don't.
3719760	3720760	Sorry, don't.
3720760	3721760	Don't.
3721760	3722760	Yeah.
3723760	3725760	All of a sudden I look controlling.
3725760	3727760	All of a sudden I look like I'm controlling.
3727760	3728760	That's my penis.
3728760	3729760	My penis.
3729760	3735760	That's for me and you and any other cute boy we find.
3735760	3736760	Any other.
3736760	3739760	Okay, next in my Ask an Australian segment.
3739760	3740760	Yeah.
3740760	3742760	That would have been...
3742760	3743760	Australian woman.
3743760	3745760	Stay away from me.
3745760	3747760	Well, let's go.
3747760	3749760	We did a show last night.
3749760	3750760	No women came on stage.
3750760	3753760	We have to have at least a woman on stage.
3753760	3758760	Josh, you're coming in close second to that.
3758760	3760760	No, I'm not a woman.
3760760	3761760	No.
3761760	3764760	No, no, it's not the same.
3764760	3767760	Speaking of Quentin Crisp, you could play a young Quentin Crisp
3767760	3769760	if there were ever a play of Quentin Crisp.
3769760	3771760	I don't know who Quentin Crisp is either.
3771760	3773760	He's a fantastic writer.
3773760	3774760	A good quote.
3774760	3776760	Oh, he's got loads of great quotes.
3776760	3779760	Well, you guys brought up that there's no women.
3779760	3780760	Can we trade your friend, Jeff?
3780760	3781760	I brought a celebrity.
3781760	3782760	All right.
3782760	3783760	Someone more important.
3783760	3784760	Let's hear it for Leilani, everybody.
3784760	3794760	This guy's got four seasons of Australian television.
3794760	3800760	I'm not a big mustache guy, but that guy's mustache is good.
3800760	3805760	I wanted to expound more on the idea of the Robin Hood,
3805760	3807760	but done as a 70s movie.
3807760	3809760	He does like Errol Flynn.
3809760	3812760	But he's dressed like Al Pacino on Scarface.
3812760	3816760	Like a cocaine driven Robin Hood thing.
3816760	3818760	Men of Respect was like Macbeth,
3818760	3822760	but Gangster is doing like a Robin Hood thing in the 70s.
3822760	3823760	It'd be cool.
3823760	3825760	Why don't you write that movie?
3825760	3827760	Do you love him?
3827760	3829760	You just seem a bit.
3829760	3830760	Do you love him?
3830760	3831760	We're friends.
3831760	3832760	Okay.
3832760	3833760	I mean, I love him in a friendly way.
3833760	3836760	I just feel like you spend a lot of time complimenting him.
3836760	3838760	I'm very...
3838760	3847760	He's got a girlfriend and they're almost engaged.
3847760	3849760	When they get married, I'm going to be their priest,
3849760	3851760	but I'm going to do it the old fashioned way.
3851760	3857760	They have to fuck me in the forest.
3857760	3860760	You guys didn't get that at all.
3860760	3861760	Nobody gets me.
3861760	3864760	I thought I could come down here.
3864760	3869760	I still don't really understand what happened to you in the forest.
3869760	3870760	Was it nothing?
3870760	3871760	It happened to me.
3871760	3874760	We're joking about the priests and that.
3874760	3877760	I know that, but I don't know what really happened.
3877760	3880760	No, it wasn't a story from my life.
3880760	3885760	I'm not one of these new millennial show runners.
3885760	3887760	I was talking about history.
3887760	3889760	I own the planet.
3889760	3892760	My beard was stretching across time.
3892760	3895760	I wasn't just like this thing happened when I was six.
3895760	3899760	I was fucking explaining shit to the planet about itself.
3899760	3901760	But that time has passed.
3901760	3903760	I wanted to ask you about Australia.
3903760	3905760	Do you guys have fortune cookies?
3905760	3906760	Yes.
3906760	3909760	Are they fortunes or are they advice?
3909760	3912760	You know fortune cookies aren't Chinese, right?
3912760	3914760	You know that you invented them.
3914760	3916760	Yeah, they were made in California, right?
3916760	3917760	Yeah.
3917760	3918760	That's fine.
3918760	3920760	Do you know my favorite fortune cookie story?
3920760	3921760	But I don't know.
3921760	3922760	Is this what we're doing?
3922760	3924760	No, I don't know your fortune cookie story.
3924760	3926760	What?
3926760	3928760	I've never heard it.
3928760	3930760	Do you have a more angering question?
3930760	3932760	It's the most presumptuous question I've ever heard.
3932760	3934760	And I'm Dan Harmon.
3934760	3937760	I've never heard your fortune cookie story.
3937760	3939760	I met you a half hour ago.
3939760	3940760	I'd love to hear it.
3940760	3942760	But how dare you?
3942760	3946760	Apparently you don't read The Daily Sun.
3946760	3948760	I'd love to hear your fortune cookie story.
3948760	3949760	It's not a great story.
3949760	3951760	Oh, well, I'll take 10.
3951760	3953760	It's my favorite fortune cookie story.
3953760	3956760	So if we had the biggest subject to this object was fortune cookie,
3956760	3958760	then this is the story I would tell you.
3958760	3963760	But we are restricted by the subject matter.
3963760	3965760	I just want you to remember that going forward.
3965760	3968760	In America, there was like a lotto, right?
3968760	3971760	And like 15 people on Second Division and they were like,
3971760	3972760	what went on?
3972760	3974760	They looked at this big investigation.
3974760	3976760	And what happened was some fortune cookie company
3976760	3979760	just always printed the same lucky numbers.
3979760	3982760	And then everyone wrote them on their lotto form
3982760	3984760	and like 12 people won the lotto.
3984760	3987760	But it's just because one company was printing them.
3987760	3988760	Is that good?
3988760	3990760	It's pretty interesting.
3990760	3992760	Was there a court case about it?
3992760	3994760	The lotto went off.
3994760	3996760	There's like second place is $2 million.
3996760	3998760	All these people won and they were like,
3998760	4000760	all these people have cheated.
4000760	4002760	So there's this big investigation.
4002760	4005760	And it turns out every person had just written their number
4005760	4006760	of this fortune cookie company.
4006760	4009760	Because like the Chicago fortune cookie company
4009760	4012760	just printed the same numbers because they're so lazy.
4012760	4015760	I thought you were saying all those people sued the lottery
4015760	4016760	or the fortune cookie company.
4016760	4017760	No, they all won.
4017760	4020760	Well, they all won, but they had to split the pie 12 ways.
4020760	4022760	I think it was like a set price.
4022760	4023760	Oh, really?
4023760	4024760	That's a great story.
4024760	4025760	I don't know.
4025760	4027760	I mean, it's a great story anyway.
4027760	4028760	It's a fine story.
4028760	4030760	It's a funner ending if they all get a million dollars.
4030760	4031760	I'm so sorry.
4031760	4033760	I didn't ask to be here.
4034760	4037760	Fate and fortune rewarded people who have so little imagination.
4037760	4040760	They pick their numbers off of a fucking fortune.
4040760	4041760	Okay, guys.
4041760	4043760	Can you figure out with me?
4043760	4045760	Can we be less combative and masculine
4045760	4047760	and figure out how to bring a woman up here?
4047760	4049760	Oh.
4049760	4052760	So that we can stuff our cap to the fairer sex
4052760	4054760	and thereby achieve equality.
4054760	4056760	How do you pick the woman?
4056760	4058760	That's what I'm asking.
4058760	4060760	That's sort of like what you do.
4060760	4062760	I don't recommend we do it by going.
4062760	4065760	Why don't we let Josh roam the crowd and like use your like...
4065760	4067760	I pick my favorite woman?
4067760	4068760	Yeah, yeah.
4068760	4072760	Like use your like divining rod to go out there and like find...
4072760	4074760	Do we have lights that come out?
4074760	4076760	Oh, my God.
4076760	4079760	What, do I have to pick my favorite woman?
4079760	4081760	You seem a bit desperate.
4083760	4085760	Put it forward.
4085760	4086760	What do you think?
4086760	4088760	Should I take the girl that wants to come up?
4088760	4089760	It seems like nice.
4089760	4091760	I sort of want the girl that's been so rejected.
4091760	4094760	We had a guy that wanted to come up yesterday and that...
4094760	4097760	You know, argument could be made that that doesn't pan out.
4097760	4099760	It's kind of like...
4099760	4100760	I don't know.
4100760	4101760	It's like styrofoam peanuts.
4101760	4102760	It's like, yeah, you want to be on stage.
4102760	4103760	Now you're on stage.
4103760	4104760	Oh, I want to talk about wanting to be on stage.
4104760	4106760	Hey, wanting to be on stage.
4106760	4108760	That's what we did for the last hour.
4108760	4109760	That sounds all right.
4109760	4110760	That's fine.
4110760	4111760	If you...
4111760	4114760	I think, you know, there might be somebody whose hair is smoldering
4114760	4115760	and you're like, do you want to come up stage?
4115760	4117760	They're like, I'm not sure.
4117760	4120760	And if their hair is smoldering, you go, what happened?
4120760	4123760	What criteria do you usually use to pick women?
4123760	4124760	I...
4126760	4127760	The size of their dicks.
4127760	4129760	I've never been good at it.
4134760	4135760	Whoever...
4135760	4138760	I just go with whoever can be lured by potato chip crumbs
4138760	4140760	arranged in a blanket.
4140760	4142760	Low-hanging fruits.
4142760	4145760	What I usually do is I'll say something gimmicky like,
4145760	4147760	oh, who's been a lot of pain tonight?
4147760	4148760	Someone's hand will shoot up and stuff.
4148760	4151760	But when we go out of Los Angeles, what happens is,
4151760	4153760	people are here, they're excited.
4153760	4154760	I'll go, who's in pain?
4154760	4156760	And someone's hand will shoot up and go, okay, you.
4156760	4157760	And they'll come up and they'll go,
4157760	4158760	I'm in pain because I stubbed my toe.
4158760	4160760	But I really wanted to be on stage.
4160760	4162760	And so it's like, why not just say who wants to be on stage?
4162760	4165760	But then the answer is, hi, my name's John.
4165760	4166760	I wanted to be on stage.
4166760	4168760	I spent this time deciding who I want,
4168760	4170760	but I don't want her to feel uncomfortable
4170760	4172760	if she doesn't want to come up.
4172760	4173760	Is the reason you're bringing her up?
4173760	4176760	I want the Asha, ladies, sitting up there.
4177760	4179760	That's who I want.
4179760	4180760	Of course.
4180760	4182760	Would you please come up?
4182760	4184760	I would love her to come up.
4184760	4186760	We promise we won't hurt you.
4190760	4192760	That's a wonderful touch.
4195760	4196760	All right.
4196760	4199760	I want to know, like, the first thing I want...
4203760	4204760	Welcome.
4207760	4209760	I'm sorry, but it's just what I wanted.
4209760	4210760	Pam?
4210760	4211760	Hello, Pam.
4211760	4214760	Pam, the first thing I want to know from you is, like,
4214760	4216760	because you're obliged to be here.
4216760	4219760	Do you like it?
4219760	4221760	It's more like working here.
4221760	4224760	Just this show, generally, or stuck.
4224760	4227760	I had no idea what this show was about, but it's perfect.
4227760	4229760	Have a seat if you could, Pam.
4229760	4230760	Thank you so much for coming up here.
4230760	4232760	We promise in advance that you will not...
4233760	4235760	Do you want a drink?
4235760	4237760	Not allowed.
4237760	4240760	You're actually working, so you can't have a drink.
4240760	4241760	No.
4241760	4242760	You don't want a drink, Pam?
4242760	4243760	Sorry, I didn't hear that.
4243760	4245760	No, she's working.
4245760	4247760	I mean, do you...
4247760	4248760	Would you want...
4248760	4251760	If you weren't working, would you want one, or are you abstemious?
4251760	4253760	Oh, no, I would want one.
4253760	4255760	Pam would love a fucking drink.
4255760	4256760	Are you kidding?
4256760	4260760	You put a drink in front of Pam on a Sunday night,
4260760	4261760	and you would...
4261760	4263760	Yeah, we'll be gone.
4263760	4264760	I don't want to be presumptuous,
4264760	4267760	and I don't know what the rules, you know,
4267760	4270760	holding your vocation accountable are,
4270760	4274760	but if I order you to have a drink on stage, doesn't that...
4274760	4275760	Don't do that.
4275760	4279760	If your prime directive is to protect the show, for instance,
4279760	4281760	then you have to have a drink.
4281760	4285760	Well, I need to be protected from the theater manager as well,
4285760	4287760	but he's not in here, and he probably can't...
4288760	4289760	Yeah.
4291760	4293760	Did she say, oh, I won't tell him?
4293760	4294760	She'll have it.
4294760	4297760	Pam, we're going to get a woman fired tonight.
4298760	4300760	You're aware, Pam, like, you know,
4300760	4303760	captains can marry people at sea?
4303760	4305760	Like, Dan, as the mayor of Hermitown,
4305760	4306760	actually has...
4306760	4308760	This is like a sovereign little nation up here,
4308760	4311760	and there's no jurisdiction that your boss can really affect.
4311760	4314760	Dan, she doesn't want a glass of vodka.
4314760	4315760	No.
4315760	4316760	Is that what that is?
4316760	4318760	Did you want a glass of vodka?
4318760	4319760	Would you like a beer, Pam?
4319760	4321760	Is there a wine or a beer?
4321760	4323760	Pam's not a fucking pig.
4326760	4328760	This is a beautiful woman.
4331760	4332760	This is a beautiful woman.
4332760	4334760	She's un-jutey.
4334760	4336760	She's the one with the glass of vodka.
4336760	4338760	She's not Charles Bukowski.
4340760	4341760	She wears a cocktail.
4341760	4343760	I think that's sexist.
4344760	4346760	Pam, where are you from?
4346760	4348760	Originally, I'm from Adelaide,
4348760	4351760	but I've been in Sydney for longer than I've been in Adelaide now.
4351760	4352760	Yeah? You like it?
4352760	4354760	I love Sydney, yeah.
4354760	4356760	Better than Adelaide.
4356760	4359760	What brought you here to begin with?
4359760	4361760	My husband got into acting school,
4361760	4363760	so I followed him over here.
4363760	4364760	Oh, she's got a husband.
4364760	4365760	Disappointing.
4368760	4369760	Sorry, guys.
4369760	4372760	What's your job title here, Pam?
4373760	4377760	Here, I'm a front-of-house worker.
4377760	4380760	An usher, but we call the department front-of-house.
4380760	4381760	How long have you been working here?
4381760	4382760	18 years.
4382760	4384760	Did you work when I did my show here?
4384760	4386760	I haven't seen you do your show here, no.
4386760	4388760	We don't get to see everything.
4388760	4389760	Last time I was in this theatre,
4389760	4391760	my dog was here and he did a shit on the stage.
4391760	4392760	Oh, no.
4392760	4395760	No, in fact, I didn't even hear talk about it afterwards.
4395760	4397760	Very rock and roll, that guy.
4398760	4400760	He's the Gigi Allen of dogs.
4403760	4404760	Forgive my ignorance,
4404760	4407760	but is it a government job or is it private?
4407760	4410760	Do you get your paycheck or you might be volunteer for all?
4410760	4412760	It's not volunteer.
4412760	4413760	Yeah, I know.
4413760	4416760	Pam charges top dollar.
4418760	4420760	I know in America ushers don't get paid.
4420760	4423760	I wouldn't be surprised if, I mean, in the theatre,
4423760	4425760	it's probably like an intern.
4425760	4427760	Yeah, it's probably the advantage being taken.
4427760	4428760	Most of us like ushering
4428760	4430760	because we're involved somehow or other in theatre.
4430760	4433760	We just love theatre and we love the versatility of the Opera House.
4433760	4436760	What a shame that you ended up at this show.
4437760	4439760	Yeah, how does that work?
4439760	4442760	I could have saw the Australian ballet tonight,
4442760	4444760	but I got a podcast.
4446760	4449760	They just truss straws in the lobby at the beginning of the night.
4449760	4453760	Okay, Pam, you're with Herman Tunan?
4454760	4457760	Actually, don't laugh because the other usher and I
4457760	4459760	were saying exactly that.
4460760	4464760	It's premium-like, so if you get fired for that.
4466760	4468760	We had no idea what this was about tonight
4468760	4470760	and we just said, okay, we'll keep an open mind about it
4470760	4471760	and here we are.
4471760	4473760	I'm still here and we're both laughing.
4473760	4475760	That's very nice.
4481760	4484760	That's all we've ever asked, an open mind.
4484760	4486760	It's so great to be here, Pam,
4486760	4488760	for your last night working at the Opera House.
4489760	4490760	Thanks.
4490760	4492760	It's a special occasion.
4493760	4496760	Oh shit, I have to host the show.
4497760	4501760	What did you think about him and the seagull?
4502760	4504760	I thought it was pretty good performing, actually.
4504760	4506760	Thank you, thank you so much.
4506760	4510760	I thought so too, but I thought it would be weird to say that.
4512760	4516760	Pam, is there anything special about Australian butter?
4517760	4520760	Where did you get that question from?
4520760	4523760	My girlfriend's mom, who...
4523760	4526760	I'm happy if you prove she's nuts tonight.
4526760	4527760	He thinks a lot.
4527760	4528760	She texted...
4528760	4530760	Cody said she was in Australia and her mom texted back,
4530760	4532760	you gotta try the butter.
4534760	4536760	Americans have bad dairy.
4536760	4537760	Okay.
4537760	4539760	You don't know it because you grew up with it.
4539760	4543760	Your milk sucks, your butter sucks, your cream is not cream.
4544760	4546760	I don't know what it is.
4546760	4550760	Cream doesn't come in uncooled plastic tubs.
4550760	4554760	Cream comes from the fridge and it's delicious.
4554760	4557760	Well, you don't drink cream as a beverage, do you?
4557760	4559760	No, you don't drink cream as a beverage.
4559760	4560760	Well, I do.
4560760	4561760	No one in the world does.
4561760	4564760	Just your country thinks that's cream and it's not right.
4564760	4566760	Wait, are you saying...
4566760	4568760	Well, that's creamer, that's different.
4568760	4571760	I don't want to satisfy you, but you've got fucked dairy.
4572760	4573760	It wouldn't start a fight.
4573760	4574760	That's a pound.
4574760	4576760	What did you think about the dairy?
4576760	4577760	I can't remember.
4577760	4578760	It was a long time ago.
4578760	4579760	It was bad.
4579760	4581760	Silly that they call cream in coffee cream.
4581760	4582760	It's not cream.
4582760	4583760	No, it's not.
4583760	4585760	And do you know what's delicious?
4585760	4587760	Cream is delicious.
4589760	4590760	Well, I asked them.
4590760	4591760	I asked them.
4592760	4594760	I think Australian butter is great.
4594760	4595760	It's better.
4595760	4598760	And so my girlfriend's mom was right to say, try the butter.
4599760	4602760	My point would not be so much that Australian butter is good
4602760	4604760	as that your butter is fucked.
4604760	4608760	So I think coming from your country to any other country,
4608760	4610760	literally any in the world,
4610760	4612760	and eating any dairy product that they have.
4612760	4614760	What's really sad is that I love chocolate,
4614760	4616760	but our chocolate is crap.
4616760	4619760	Hershey's is the most fucked.
4619760	4622760	It's so fucked.
4622760	4626760	And you feel like we're number one, American number one.
4626760	4628760	We put the Hershey's Kisses backstage.
4628760	4629760	They're always backstage.
4629760	4631760	And they taste literally like vomit.
4631760	4632760	And I'm not saying that.
4632760	4633760	There's wax in them.
4633760	4634760	They're waxy.
4634760	4635760	Not like a hyperbole way.
4635760	4638760	They just taste a bit like vomit.
4638760	4643760	And it's, I don't know, because you have cows, right?
4643760	4647760	Yeah, but we pump our cows probably full of more hormones
4647760	4649760	and chemicals and crap and stuff like that.
4649760	4650760	It's a real shame.
4650760	4651760	We also feed them different stuff.
4651760	4653760	We feed them bad shit.
4653760	4655760	Well, you feed them bad shit, I imagine.
4655760	4658760	You're out and giving them acid tabs.
4658760	4660760	I didn't hurt seagulls.
4660760	4663760	Like, they loved it.
4663760	4666760	We all had a great time, and then we went home.
4666760	4668760	He almost got hurt by a seagull.
4668760	4669760	He almost got wounded.
4669760	4673760	Yeah, I'm the victim.
4673760	4677760	No, you're the big, bad wolf in that Red Riding Hood story.
4677760	4679760	No, no, no, no, no, no.
4679760	4683760	You were a boy, and you had a dick.
4684760	4687760	And then you were making out with a boy who also had a dick.
4687760	4691760	Who would you want to have a bigger dick?
4691760	4694760	I did think of this as you were discussing.
4700760	4704760	I think it depends on the relationship.
4704760	4706760	You're not going to be able to party.
4706760	4708760	Bold stance, Pam.
4708760	4709760	No, no, no.
4709760	4710760	I'm not letting her off the back.
4710760	4712760	You guys are like, she's amazing.
4712760	4714760	Well, come on, but she's going to earn a key.
4714760	4716760	She's going to give us a match.
4716760	4718760	She's going to give us the spectrum.
4718760	4720760	What does it matter if you're together for a long time,
4720760	4721760	you're together for one night?
4721760	4723760	You're either happy because they've got a big dick
4723760	4725760	or you're not happy because they've got a big dick,
4725760	4728760	whether it's for two years or...
4728760	4731760	To tell the truth, I haven't really thought about it.
4731760	4732760	You've just said you thought about it.
4732760	4734760	Well, I know, but I couldn't come up with an answer.
4734760	4736760	All right, how about this?
4736760	4740760	This is the worst question I've ever asked anybody.
4740760	4748760	As a woman, if you were instantly a man,
4748760	4750760	how big would you want your dick to be?
4750760	4753760	Would you like to have just an average right down the middle dick?
4753760	4755760	Would you want to have a big old porn dick
4755760	4761760	or just something kind of easily concealable?
4761760	4765760	This is my new favorite show.
4765760	4767760	How long is our visa?
4767760	4769760	Can we get paid to do this?
4769760	4774760	I think it's over after he answers this question.
4774760	4777760	Does it really matter to you?
4777760	4778760	It matters to me.
4778760	4780760	Yes, it does.
4780760	4781760	I want to be clear about that.
4781760	4782760	The truth matters.
4782760	4784760	We won't judge you whatever the answer is.
4784760	4785760	Oh, no.
4785760	4787760	But also, you don't have to answer if you're really terrible.
4787760	4788760	Yeah, you also don't have to answer.
4788760	4789760	You know that, right?
4789760	4790760	Okay, God.
4790760	4792760	Well, you forced a drink into her hand.
4792760	4794760	All right, okay, all right.
4794760	4798760	The fucking seagull whisperer is now...
4798760	4801760	Suddenly, you're a good guy.
4801760	4803760	I'm sorry I'm right all the time.
4803760	4805760	I can't help it.
4805760	4806760	All right.
4806760	4809760	Pam, obviously, you do not have to talk about anything you want to talk about.
4809760	4812760	You don't have to answer, but big, long, expectant pause.
4812760	4816760	Okay, if I gave an answer, I wouldn't have a good justification for it.
4816760	4818760	So I'd just be giving an answer just to...
4818760	4819760	Right.
4819760	4820760	Yeah, if I answered.
4820760	4821760	It would be arbitrary.
4821760	4822760	I can't answer it.
4822760	4824760	It would be arbitrary, and what's the point?
4824760	4825760	Big.
4825760	4826760	You should want us a big one.
4827760	4828760	Okay, okay.
4828760	4829760	She should have a truck.
4829760	4830760	Right, okay.
4830760	4831760	Okay, Josh.
4831760	4832760	Whatever you say.
4832760	4833760	Yeah.
4833760	4834760	She wants a big one.
4834760	4835760	Right.
4835760	4836760	I mean, why not?
4836760	4837760	I mean...
4837760	4838760	Well, there's reasons why not.
4838760	4839760	It's painful.
4839760	4840760	But I don't want to be...
4840760	4841760	Right.
4841760	4842760	I don't know, right?
4842760	4843760	Yeah.
4843760	4846760	No, well, I'm putting the spotlight over it myself, because I'm asking, you know...
4846760	4849760	Because, like, you could say to a woman, if you were instantly a man, pick a dick size.
4849760	4851760	But why not just say to a guy, pick a dick size?
4851760	4852760	Because I have a dick size.
4852760	4853760	What would you pick?
4853760	4855760	Well, you've got high five.
4855760	4856760	Happy with what you've...
4856760	4857760	Okay.
4857760	4858760	I've got...
4858760	4859760	High five.
4859760	4864760	I've got incentive to focus on her needs.
4864760	4866760	That's what I've got.
4866760	4873760	I've got the big modern dick called a reason to go down on her.
4873760	4875760	And I think...
4875760	4881260	But, you know, knowing what I know, and learning what I've learned, I guess I'd like to have
4881260	4883760	a medium-sized dick.
4884760	4885760	Just a normal...
4886760	4891760	And I don't know what that is, because every time there's a conversation about dick size,
4891760	4894760	I mentally flee.
4894760	4895760	I've never measured it.
4895760	4899760	All guys have a story in the States about, like, the time they've tried to measure it.
4899760	4901760	Like, do I start with the balls and all this stuff?
4901760	4908760	I've never had the quote-unquote balls to take a ruler near my groin.
4908760	4910760	I'm afraid to see the hard numbers.
4910760	4911760	Just with your fingers.
4911760	4914760	Just what do you think an average-sized penis is?
4914760	4917760	I think an average-sized penis.
4917760	4921760	From the front of the balls...
4921760	4922760	From the top of the...
4922760	4923760	From the top of the...
4923760	4924760	From the top...
4924760	4925760	Not the balls.
4925760	4926760	No, what do you mean?
4926760	4927760	Can I sit down?
4927760	4928760	Well, this is important.
4928760	4929760	No.
4929760	4930760	Tom, you're in this.
4930760	4931760	You're in this.
4931760	4932760	This is...
4932760	4933760	Tom, we need a woman.
4933760	4934760	It's perspective.
4934760	4937760	I want to know if we mean from the...
4937760	4939760	So it's from the top.
4939760	4943760	From the top of the abdomen.
4943760	4945760	Welcome to the show, Pam.
4945760	4947760	Aren't you happy you're up here?
4947760	4948760	Yes.
4948760	4949760	All right.
4949760	4953760	I'm going to decide on a length that I think is average.
4953760	4954760	Use my arm.
4954760	4955760	Use your arm.
4955760	4956760	Yeah.
4956760	4960760	That's like an easy way for the perspective.
4960760	4961760	It's good.
4961760	4962760	Use my arm.
4962760	4964760	It's the worst pickup line.
4964760	4967760	Well, roll off your sleeve and I'll make the marks.
4967760	4968760	Is there a pen?
4968760	4969760	Not marks.
4969760	4970760	Two fingers.
4970760	4971760	Well, you have a...
4971760	4973760	Just why are you being so awkward about this?
4973760	4975760	You're a fucking adult, okay?
4975760	4976760	Just where do you think...
4976760	4977760	I don't...
4977760	4978760	Yeah.
4978760	4980760	Wait, is it a wreck or a flaccid?
4980760	4981760	It's a wreck.
4981760	4982760	Obviously a wreck.
4982760	4983760	You just piece of shit.
4983760	4988760	Nobody gives a shit about your flaccid dick.
4988760	4993760	Nobody cares about your flaccid.
4993760	4994760	My flaccid...
4994760	4997760	If your flaccid dick is long, you're weird in a different way.
4997760	4999760	Well, there's showers and growers.
4999760	5005760	Everyone knows that, but if you have an impressively long flaccid dick, I feel superior to you.
5005760	5007760	Because you have some weird thing going on.
5007760	5008760	You're like an elephant man.
5008760	5009760	You're a show.
5009760	5010760	Not an elephant man.
5010760	5011760	That's terrible.
5011760	5012760	That's not what I meant.
5012760	5015760	Thank you for holding my arm so tenderly.
5015760	5016760	All right.
5016760	5017760	I'm going to...
5017760	5019760	This is the top of my...
5019760	5020760	No, I'm not.
5020760	5023760	I'm just going to start with room to finish.
5024760	5025760	Dan, can I make a picture here?
5025760	5027760	Just for showbiz sake.
5027760	5029760	You draw yours, Pam.
5029760	5031760	You don't look on Josh's left arm.
5031760	5032760	You draw what you think.
5032760	5033760	Brilliant.
5033760	5034760	You draw what you think...
5034760	5035760	Fucking brilliant.
5035760	5036760	It's the average...
5036760	5038760	That's fucking brilliant.
5040760	5046760	We got to stay in Australia and start pitching shows.
5046760	5047760	Oh, wait.
5047760	5048760	We have to...
5048760	5049760	Okay.
5049760	5052760	So what I'm going to do, Pam, just to tell you my technique,
5052760	5057760	is I'll imagine the tip being his wrist.
5057760	5059760	So I'm going to make a mark at his wrist.
5059760	5060760	No, Pam.
5060760	5061760	No fair looking.
5061760	5064760	You have to be like...
5064760	5068760	The control is that you don't know what he's doing.
5068760	5071760	But, Pam, while he's doing it, you have to be mentally...
5071760	5073760	Don't stroke it out with this.
5073760	5075760	Don't tickle me.
5075760	5076760	Pam, in your mind...
5076760	5077760	Don't make it weird.
5077760	5081760	I'm not sure what you think is the medium, mean, median size.
5081760	5083760	This is what you think is average?
5083760	5084760	What is exactly average?
5084760	5085760	Of any man.
5085760	5087760	Come on.
5087760	5089760	I don't know what that meant.
5089760	5090760	What did that mean?
5090760	5092760	Of mankind.
5092760	5093760	Mankind.
5093760	5094760	Mankind.
5094760	5096760	What you would consider right down the middle.
5096760	5097760	The average.
5097760	5098760	The average.
5098760	5099760	Yeah.
5099760	5100760	Pretend it's like a...
5100760	5102760	You know those contests where you guess how many jelly beans in a jar?
5102760	5105760	Just try to really just nail it.
5106760	5107760	So that's the end.
5107760	5108760	So that's the end there.
5108760	5109760	And then you go back.
5109760	5110760	Pam...
5110760	5111760	Anyway...
5111760	5112760	I mean, you're getting paid to be here.
5112760	5113760	I'm doing it for free.
5113760	5115760	Yeah.
5115760	5117760	What am I going to cop after it?
5119760	5121760	We're getting a woman's perspective.
5125760	5126760	Well, it's...
5129760	5130760	No.
5131760	5132760	I hope...
5132760	5136760	I hope, Madam, that's the title of this episode.
5136760	5137760	A Woman's Perspective.
5137760	5139760	You're both being ridiculous.
5139760	5140760	It's true.
5140760	5143760	We are not passing the Bechdel test at this current time.
5143760	5144760	Sorry.
5144760	5145760	It's fine.
5145760	5146760	It's fine.
5146760	5147760	It's probably...
5147760	5148760	I probably deserve it.
5148760	5149760	All right.
5149760	5150760	You guys are both fucked.
5150760	5152760	Like, that is not a big big suck.
5152760	5153760	Well, what...
5153760	5154760	Okay.
5154760	5161760	Pam has lived a good life.
5161760	5164760	That's what we know.
5174760	5177760	Those are both too high.
5177760	5179760	And I still feel like...
5179760	5180760	I don't want to...
5180760	5182760	I've seen some dicks in my time, right?
5182760	5184760	And I would have seen that dick...
5184760	5186760	Twice.
5187760	5189760	Carmen is pretending.
5189760	5192760	He's just an outright lying.
5192760	5195760	You mean because I want people to tell me it's...
5195760	5197760	my estimate's too big because that'll make me feel better?
5197760	5198760	Is that what you mean?
5198760	5200760	Because I want to be honest and say...
5200760	5201760	This is outrageous.
5201760	5202760	This is not...
5202760	5203760	I don't know.
5203760	5204760	Well, I don't understand.
5204760	5205760	This is why I don't know.
5205760	5207760	I don't know if you drew it too big out of, like, cockiness.
5207760	5209760	Like, well, of course they're this big because I'm this big.
5209760	5210760	No.
5210760	5211760	Or out of some clothing.
5211760	5213760	I don't know if it's, like, if I were...
5213760	5215760	He watches a lot of porn.
5215760	5217760	He watches a lot of porn, Josh.
5217760	5220760	Is that what's going on with Pam?
5221760	5224760	No, Pam apparently went to Italy for a while.
5226760	5228760	Both of these...
5228760	5229760	I'm obsessed.
5229760	5231760	All right, now...
5231760	5232760	Now what Pam's is...
5232760	5240760	I'm gonna roll up my sleeves and I'm gonna have Spencer and Josh draw their ideal clitoris size.
5241760	5243760	Now are you happy, ma'am?
5249760	5252760	You tell us what you want a woman's perspective on.
5252760	5253760	What?
5253760	5254760	Anything.
5254760	5255760	Anything.
5255760	5256760	Not dicks.
5257760	5258760	I don't know.
5258760	5262760	I just, like, actually ask her a question and listen to the answer.
5264760	5266760	I asked her if she wanted a drink.
5266760	5268760	She said no, and I got her a drink.
5271760	5272760	Oh, my God.
5278760	5281760	I haven't been to Brisbane in the backwards once.
5281760	5282760	Are you from Brisbane?
5282760	5283760	Yeah.
5284760	5289760	Are you just upset because I said Brisbane is racist and now you're trying to tell me that I'm such a...
5289760	5291760	Somebody give her a shoe to puke in.
5293760	5297760	I was up on stage in Brisbane.
5297760	5298760	Oh, shit.
5299760	5300760	I did a few toys then.
5301760	5304760	Dan, you asked me what I would like for the show.
5305760	5306760	Is it Louise?
5306760	5307760	Yeah, it is.
5308760	5315760	Hey, and the first thing I thought of actually was I would like you to be more inclusive of women on stage.
5316760	5317760	But you wanted to...
5317760	5320760	You told them you should lose weight, didn't you?
5321760	5322760	She didn't say lose weight.
5322760	5325760	She said take care of yourself.
5325760	5327760	She said take care of yourself.
5327760	5328760	Did she do it in this way?
5328760	5330760	No, she said take care of yourself.
5330760	5331760	That was implied.
5331760	5333760	She's a gold star family.
5333760	5334760	Let's give her some respect.
5334760	5335760	No, she's great.
5335760	5339760	But she could have said that last time and we would have taken it into account.
5339760	5341760	We had two women up on stage that night.
5341760	5342760	Oh, it was awesome.
5343760	5346760	It felt redundant to say that at the time.
5346760	5350760	It seems hard because there's not that many women on stage now, but I'm gay.
5352760	5353760	So it's like...
5354760	5357760	I'd like to see more racial representation.
5358760	5360760	Well, yeah, I mean, we're SOL fans.
5360760	5361760	We're in Sydney.
5363760	5365760	It's the home of white people and two honorary Asians.
5366760	5369760	But Louise, I will say that's just like...
5370760	5376760	But as you said, the night that that was your first thought, it didn't apply because you were one of two women that came up on stage.
5376760	5377760	Me and my friend.
5379760	5380760	You know, because we're both sorry.
5380760	5383760	But it is a thing, like, women get on stage with you.
5383760	5384760	I'm sorry.
5384760	5385760	She's the Phantom of the Opera.
5390760	5393760	Well, if I ask her to keep talking and then we mock her when she talks, then we're like...
5393760	5396760	How did you feel about how we treated the dude that was on stage?
5396760	5399760	Because I don't feel like I was that nice to him.
5401760	5404760	But there's also two different things.
5404760	5405760	It's like, well, we brought Pam up.
5405760	5408760	I thought that was a really inspired choice on Josh's part.
5411760	5415760	And we didn't like look at Pam and go, let's talk about dicks, baby.
5415760	5418760	Like, I don't know, we were like random drunk.
5418760	5424760	But the thing is, we bring Pam up and it's three men who are comedians who are like, just can't wait to get a joke.
5424760	5427760	And so we're not really giving Pam full, like, time to...
5428760	5430760	Ask me something, then.
5430760	5431760	Huh?
5431760	5433760	Yeah. Well, let's ask Pam stuff.
5434760	5435760	About what?
5436760	5437760	I said that.
5437760	5438760	Where are you listening?
5438760	5439760	Wow.
5440760	5443760	Is he a chauvinist monster?
5443760	5444760	Fuck me.
5445760	5447760	Yeah, the race for the high road times.
5447760	5449760	Pam, it gets boring real fast.
5449760	5452760	You moved here because your husband was coming to take an acting class.
5452760	5453760	Yeah, that's right.
5453760	5454760	So that's ambitious.
5455760	5457760	You didn't move here because someone had a career.
5457760	5459760	He had a possible career.
5459760	5460760	Yeah.
5460760	5462760	Did that Pam out for him?
5463760	5465760	No, he quit after a couple of years.
5466760	5468760	But he did acting for a while.
5469760	5472760	And then he did what a lot of actors do and became a teacher.
5472760	5475760	I love that you thought, oh, what, we've got to talk about something.
5475760	5477760	And then you asked her about her husband.
5477760	5478760	No, no, no.
5480760	5481760	That's why I asked her.
5481760	5482760	Pam, when?
5482760	5486760	Because she moved here, you moved here because of your man.
5488760	5493760	But did you have ambitions when you came to Sydney of your own?
5495760	5501760	An equal ambition, but it was his getting into neither that decided it,
5501760	5503760	that gave us the positive momentum to do it.
5503760	5505760	But I was very happy to move to Sydney.
5505760	5506760	All right.
5506760	5507760	I think I can get this up to some higher ground.
5507760	5508760	It's a long time ago.
5509760	5519760	Pam, didn't you think it was romantic when Russell Crowe took Steve Irwin's widow into his own...
5519760	5520760	Did he? I didn't know that.
5520760	5521760	I thought I read something about that.
5521760	5522760	What did he do with it?
5523760	5525760	That's not true, Russell Crowe, Steve Irwin's wife?
5525760	5526760	What did he do?
5526760	5527760	Yeah, I don't know.
5527760	5529760	I don't know what Russell Crowe has done lately.
5529760	5532760	Well, it's interesting what makes it back to the States.
5532760	5535760	Well, I didn't hear you say anything.
5535760	5537760	I didn't hear you describe an action.
5538760	5540760	I thought he was getting married to her.
5540760	5541760	To who?
5541760	5542760	Steve Irwin's widow.
5542760	5543760	Oh, OK.
5544760	5545760	No.
5545760	5546760	I'm happy to be wrong about it.
5546760	5547760	I think it's disgusting.
5548760	5551760	I was also pretending to have an opinion about it.
5551760	5553760	I thought it was a real thing.
5553760	5556760	I'm just worried that you think we were talking over Pam because she's a woman,
5556760	5561760	but it's just when you bring someone on stage, you talk over them so that they don't feel comfortable.
5561760	5562760	OK.
5562760	5563760	I have more questions for Pam.
5563760	5564760	We can solve this problem.
5564760	5565760	Pam.
5565760	5566760	Yes?
5566760	5576760	What do you think of these hotel rooms where you have to have your key in a slot in order for the fucking power to be on?
5577760	5580760	Is that green or is that bullshit?
5584760	5586760	I haven't stayed in that many hotels where I've had that,
5586760	5588760	but it's something you've just got to get used to.
5588760	5591760	I presume it's for the benefit of energy saving or something or other.
5591760	5592760	Yeah, definitely.
5592760	5594760	Yeah, or that's what the patriarchy tells you.
5594760	5596760	Very reasonable response.
5596760	5598760	Just go change your behavior.
5598760	5599760	Pam, I have a question for you.
5599760	5603760	If you were in a room and there was two doors, and in front...
5603760	5605760	No, I'm just trying to keep it.
5606760	5608760	I was going to do the labyrinth riddle.
5611760	5612760	What's that?
5612760	5613760	All right.
5613760	5614760	I have a question.
5614760	5615760	No.
5615760	5616760	Pam.
5616760	5617760	They know a lot about pop culture.
5617760	5618760	No.
5618760	5619760	That we don't.
5619760	5620760	No.
5620760	5621760	Pam.
5621760	5622760	Yes.
5622760	5625760	Do you think that passport theft is a thing in hotels?
5625760	5631760	Like, if I leave my passport on the end table, what's somebody going to do?
5631760	5633760	Take my passport and then they're going to...
5633760	5636760	I'll leave my passport anywhere that I did...
5636760	5638760	What do you think someone's going to do with it?
5638760	5639760	They're not going to be traveler-like.
5639760	5640760	You guys probably are.
5640760	5642760	Don't put yourself down like that, Pam.
5643760	5644760	Find out where I am.
5644760	5649760	What is the thing that a passport thief is gaining by stealing the passport?
5649760	5650760	Does it make fake passports?
5650760	5653760	Does this have a definite answer or are you just asking my opinion?
5653760	5654760	Yeah, just a guess.
5654760	5655760	Okay.
5655760	5656760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5656760	5657760	I don't know.
5657760	5658760	I guess we're all afraid of identity theft.
5658760	5659760	Right.
5659760	5660760	Can't be good for someone to have your passport.
5660760	5663760	But is a passport valuable to a stranger?
5663760	5664760	Yes.
5664760	5665760	This guy's going to stand up.
5665760	5666760	He's so excited.
5666760	5667760	There's a huge...
5667760	5668760	I like the idea that someone knows how to...
5668760	5669760	No, it's a boy.
5669760	5670760	You can't ask a boy.
5670760	5671760	Oh, God.
5673760	5674760	Sorry.
5674760	5675760	You're not allowed.
5675760	5676760	We've had too many boys.
5677760	5678760	Okay.
5678760	5679760	All right.
5679760	5680760	Okay.
5680760	5681760	Well, okay.
5681760	5686760	Pam, if you don't have an opinion about this, I'll ask that guy, but he'll keep his seat.
5686760	5689760	Do you really want the boomerang to come back?
5691760	5692760	That's...
5692760	5693760	I understand...
5693760	5696760	Are we being racist here?
5697760	5698760	No.
5698760	5701760	You can't do anything right today.
5701760	5703760	I'm safeguarded from this.
5703760	5707760	If you internally have those compartments, I'm just like, ha ha, Australians.
5707760	5708760	Australians?
5708760	5709760	Yeah.
5709760	5710760	Very uncomfortable.
5710760	5714760	I think if the boomerang doesn't come back, that means you succeeded, right?
5714760	5716760	If you're a good boomerang thrower?
5716760	5717760	Yeah.
5717760	5718760	How are you?
5718760	5720760	Is it supposed to hit something and then come back?
5720760	5721760	No.
5721760	5722760	Really?
5722760	5723760	No.
5723760	5724760	The majority said no.
5724760	5725760	How can it come back?
5725760	5728760	So it's like, you have a go, you miss, it comes back, you have a go, you miss, it comes
5728760	5730760	back, you have a go, you hit, you don't need to throw it.
5730760	5731760	That's what I was just saying.
5731760	5734760	So it's like, it doesn't matter that it doesn't come back because you're finished, because
5734760	5735760	you've got yourself some delicious...
5735760	5737760	You don't want the boomerang to come back.
5737760	5738760	How do...
5738760	5739760	Captain boomerangs don't come back.
5739760	5740760	Huh.
5740760	5742760	Well, they don't get thrown properly.
5744760	5745760	And if you don't hit something...
5745760	5747760	If they're thrown properly...
5747760	5751760	If you made a boomerang where the leading edge of it was like razor blades, it could
5751760	5753760	go straight through like the neck of a thing...
5753760	5754760	Yeah, but it wouldn't come back.
5754760	5755760	...and keep coming back.
5755760	5756760	Pam...
5756760	5757760	Like an odd job at Goldfinger.
5757760	5758760	We can move on.
5758760	5761760	That's clearly too controversial a topic.
5762760	5764760	You're sophisticated people.
5764760	5765760	You deserve better.
5765760	5766760	Yes.
5766760	5767760	Pam.
5767760	5768760	Yeah.
5768760	5770760	Pam, have you downloaded Mario Run?
5772760	5773760	Oh, what's...
5773760	5774760	Oh, shit.
5775760	5776760	That's not gonna come back.
5776760	5777760	That's not gonna come back.
5777760	5778760	You're gonna kill someone.
5778760	5779760	That's not gonna come back.
5779760	5780760	All right, yeah, it's not gonna come back.
5780760	5781760	Read the sticker.
5781760	5782760	It comes back.
5783760	5789760	Made by Jimmy James, Jim learnt this craft from his grandfather who grew up among Aboriginal
5789760	5792760	elders in central Queensland to throw.
5792760	5795760	Hold vertically with rounded side facing you.
5795760	5800760	Throw with a flicking action 30 degrees to the oncoming wind.
5801760	5803760	Made in Australia.
5804760	5808760	Everybody, reach under your seat and put your safety goggles on.
5809760	5812760	They tell you to throw it into oncoming wind.
5812760	5815760	Throw anything into oncoming wind and it'll come back.
5817760	5818760	Yeah.
5818760	5819760	I'm not gonna do that.
5819760	5820760	Oh, shit.
5820760	5822760	No, you guys just want me to throw...
5822760	5823760	It's still floating.
5823760	5824760	...it could be a rotten plant.
5824760	5825760	I just...
5825760	5826760	You know, it's not gonna...
5829760	5830760	It's...
5831760	5832760	Well, they said...
5833760	5834760	Do you have a girlfriend?
5834760	5837760	She's not gonna be happy when she finds out about this guy.
5838760	5840760	Pam, she doesn't matter neither.
5841760	5845760	Pam, you don't have to have an opinion, but you're welcome to have one.
5845760	5850760	If I were to have a baby with my girlfriend Cody, what do you...
5850760	5854760	Should we name her Forensic Heller or Cody's Baby?
5857760	5858760	We love forensic files.
5858760	5860760	What's the last name gonna be?
5861760	5862760	Cody's.
5863760	5864760	Well...
5865760	5867760	Well, Cody's Baby Harmon, I think, would be...
5867760	5869760	The last name would be Harmon. Let's just say that.
5869760	5870760	It's just Cody's.
5870760	5872760	You really gotta practice saying...
5872760	5873760	I'm also a teacher.
5874760	5880760	You gotta practice saying the names and not end up with a name that the kid's gonna be embarrassed by
5880760	5884760	and want to change or is very similar to somebody else's.
5884760	5886760	You gotta be unique but not stupid about it.
5886760	5887760	So, Cody's Baby.
5887760	5888760	Pam's?
5889760	5891760	Very good at not answering questions.
5892760	5895760	Honestly, what do you teach and what level?
5896760	5897760	I teach high school.
5897760	5898760	Really?
5898760	5899760	How many years?
5899760	5900760	How many years have I been teaching?
5901760	5902760	Too many to add up.
5903760	5905760	You're not teaching math, apparently.
5909760	5910760	No, I don't teach math.
5910760	5911760	Or history.
5912760	5914760	Wait, so that...
5914760	5916760	Okay, buried the lead, you're a teacher.
5916760	5918760	We had a teacher up last night.
5918760	5920760	You didn't just steal his job idea, did you?
5920760	5921760	No.
5922760	5926760	So, how old is the oldest kids you're teaching?
5927760	5929760	Probably 17.
5929760	5933760	So, you've seen the worst of humanity.
5935760	5937760	You've had every reason to turn your back on it.
5937760	5938760	No, I don't see it like that.
5938760	5941760	Well, what's your secret? How do you not see it like that?
5942760	5944760	Because you're there with them. Is that the secret?
5944760	5946760	If we knew them, we wouldn't be afraid of them?
5946760	5949760	I teach subjects that most kids like learning.
5949760	5950760	What do you teach?
5950760	5952760	I teach design and technology.
5952760	5953760	Oh, cool.
5955760	5959760	Which is not learning how to fix computers and stuff.
5959760	5961760	It's using technology for design.
5961760	5963760	Oh, okay.
5963760	5965760	So, they're coming in on a good mood.
5965760	5967760	Yeah, they do. They enjoy the lessons.
5967760	5971760	But they'd still disrespect you if they felt like lack of...
5971760	5973760	You're dealing with pubescent primates.
5973760	5975760	Yeah, I'm pretty used to it now.
5975760	5976760	Are you ever...
5976760	5981760	Quite a hard guess, because we really want some pain and some misery.
5981760	5984760	But every time I ask a question, it sort of seems quite nice.
5984760	5986760	All your answers are really lovely.
5986760	5987760	You want me to be in pain and misery?
5987760	5989760	No, no, well, yeah.
5989760	5992760	Some sort of nitty gritty, like, oh, no, my husband.
5992760	5994760	It would be good, wouldn't it?
5994760	5996760	He probably doesn't know I'm here. I know that.
5996760	5999760	I support him and I like my job.
5999760	6002760	It's sort of hard for comedy, isn't it, when someone's happy?
6003760	6005760	I might be acting.
6006760	6008760	Well, usually what we do...
6008760	6010760	I'll go, like, oh, who's having a terrible time tonight?
6010760	6013760	But we don't want them to come up and talk about how terrible things are.
6013760	6017760	I think we hope for, like, silver linings and things.
6017760	6018760	How is she so happy?
6018760	6022760	So, obviously, the terrible thing that happened is she was yanked up here,
6022760	6025760	and the silver lining is that she's quite happy.
6025760	6027760	So, that's already worked. It's worked.
6027760	6028760	Can I go now?
6028760	6029760	It's provided me with a good show.
6029760	6031760	If you want to go, you don't feel comfortable.
6031760	6032760	You can definitely go, yeah.
6032760	6034760	We don't want to make you uncomfortable.
6034760	6037760	Do you regret me picking you?
6037760	6038760	No.
6038760	6041760	Has this been a good experience?
6041760	6042760	Yeah, fine.
6042760	6043760	I hope so.
6043760	6044760	It's not.
6044760	6045760	Pam.
6045760	6046760	I hope so.
6046760	6048760	Yeah, I'm pleased to have met you.
6048760	6050760	Pam, Josh and I are going to...
6050760	6052760	This is how we're going to...
6052760	6054760	You work in the theatre because you love it.
6054760	6056760	You've seen shows here.
6056760	6058760	There's shows you haven't seen here.
6058760	6063760	Is there a theatrical performance that Josh and Jeff and I can do
6063760	6065760	that would, like, fulfill your fantasies?
6065760	6066760	Like, what hasn't shown here?
6066760	6067760	Or whether it's...
6067760	6070760	You can either pitch something new or...
6070760	6072760	You mean you perform it?
6072760	6073760	Right.
6073760	6075760	But don't imagine me performing it.
6075760	6078760	Imagine what you'd like to see, and then I'll ruin it.
6078760	6081760	All right.
6081760	6082760	There's always Shakespeare.
6082760	6083760	Right, okay.
6083760	6084760	Done.
6084760	6085760	Done and done.
6085760	6088760	You should know I'm not educated.
6088760	6090760	That's because you're from Brisbane.
6090760	6092760	Oh.
6092760	6095760	I will clear this opera house!
6095760	6098760	I will clear this opera house!
6098760	6101760	Yes.
6101760	6104760	I just saw that girl that got so mad at me before climbing.
6104760	6105760	Yeah.
6105760	6107760	You guys...
6107760	6111760	Pam doesn't look funny.
6111760	6112760	Yeah, well, yeah.
6112760	6117760	Anything you like that Pam does, I made happen.
6117760	6120760	He's the Phil Spector of Pam.
6121760	6122760	Right.
6122760	6123760	He discovered her.
6123760	6124760	He made her.
6124760	6130760	When he found her, she was just over there in the darkness.
6130760	6133760	But, you know, anything you would like to see...
6133760	6134760	Look, you don't have to...
6134760	6136760	Don't try to confine yourself to my dumb game.
6136760	6137760	She said Shakespeare.
6137760	6138760	Right, but...
6138760	6139760	Well, okay.
6139760	6140760	You're right.
6140760	6141760	She did, and I forgot because I'm drunk.
6141760	6142760	Okay.
6142760	6143760	Anything specific?
6143760	6145760	What's your favorite Shakespeare production?
6145760	6149760	Oh, there's been a really good Othello here.
6150760	6151760	That's perfect for dance.
6151760	6152760	Oh, yeah.
6152760	6153760	You want something that she hasn't seen, right?
6153760	6154760	It's like the one that you haven't seen.
6154760	6156760	Yeah, well, because, yeah, I know...
6156760	6158760	Let's just do Othello.
6158760	6160760	Okay, I don't know anything about Othello here.
6160760	6161760	Well, I know Josh does.
6161760	6164760	Josh is a huge Shakespeare buff.
6164760	6165760	All right, well, let's...
6165760	6166760	We'll do our version of Othello.
6166760	6167760	We don't actually...
6167760	6168760	Outgassed Othello.
6168760	6169760	Do you know the story?
6169760	6170760	What's that?
6170760	6171760	Oh, yeah, Pam.
6171760	6172760	Pam, Pam, tell us the story.
6172760	6173760	Yeah.
6173760	6174760	Yes, thank you, Pam.
6174760	6175760	If you give us...
6175760	6176760	Give us a log line of Othello, can you?
6176760	6178760	Like a kind of an elevator pitch?
6179760	6180760	I can't be fun.
6185760	6187760	I'm going to walk Pam back to her seat,
6187760	6188760	because I don't want to have to...
6188760	6191760	She's going to give us the goddamn description of the story,
6191760	6194760	and then she's going to take her seat and enjoy the most...
6194760	6196760	I think Pam should play Desdemona in this.
6196760	6197760	I think we should...
6198760	6199760	No, don't...
6199760	6201760	Okay, you want to lead up line.
6201760	6204760	Yeah, just like set the stage for Othello.
6204760	6205760	He can't be trusted.
6205760	6206760	Othello.
6207760	6209760	I think he's having it off with my wife.
6209760	6210760	Okay.
6210760	6211760	Well, I won't play...
6216760	6218760	Let's have a hand for Pam, everybody.
6218760	6219760	Pam?
6219760	6220760	Pam!
6231760	6232760	All right.
6233760	6234760	Ah.
6235760	6236760	Iago.
6236760	6240760	How be thee on this fine morrow?
6241760	6243760	I'm good, Othello.
6245760	6246760	Ah!
6246760	6247760	Tis well met.
6247760	6248760	Ah, Desdemona!
6248760	6249760	Jesus Christ.
6249760	6251760	Desdemona, my beautiful wife.
6251760	6252760	The wife...
6252760	6253760	No, I'm not the wife.
6253760	6254760	Yes.
6255760	6258760	The fucketh I say, you are my wife.
6259760	6265760	The wife, true as true can be, true as true to me,
6265760	6269760	as fidelity can possibly also be.
6270760	6271760	I'm going to leave Iago.
6271760	6274760	Don't be an asshole and fuck shit up for me.
6277760	6278760	Oh.
6278760	6279760	So anyway, so...
6279760	6280760	Desdemona.
6281760	6287760	I can't do sex with you because I'm the wife
6287760	6289760	of that guy.
6290760	6292760	The wife of that guy.
6292760	6293760	Yeah.
6294760	6296760	A pittance of phrasing.
6300760	6304760	For what is of what and of what will have thou?
6304760	6305760	All right.
6305760	6307760	Will not the moon be of the sun?
6307760	6308760	Yeah.
6308760	6310760	Shall not the sun have an earth?
6310760	6312760	Will not the body of heaven?
6312760	6313760	All right, so I'll tell you what.
6313760	6314760	I'll tell you what.
6315760	6316760	Did you stop it?
6316760	6317760	I'll suck it.
6320760	6324760	A pox is born on this fortnight.
6327760	6328760	Well, that's it.
6328760	6330760	Curse me for loving it so.
6330760	6336760	Oh, oh, oh, phi, phi foul handkerchief,
6336760	6339760	proof that my wife...
6339760	6340760	Are we in the scene?
6340760	6341760	Are we...
6341760	6344760	I was doing a different scene over here.
6344760	6345760	I didn't take...
6345760	6346760	I didn't take him from...
6346760	6348760	I think he actually knows what that was.
6348760	6349760	Oh, fuck it.
6349760	6350760	Okay.
6350760	6351760	Just do your own scene.
6351760	6352760	No, come on.
6352760	6353760	Don't.
6353760	6354760	Oh, come on.
6354760	6355760	It's called Othello.
6355760	6356760	It's not called Two Dickheads.
6356760	6357760	I know.
6357760	6358760	Come on.
6359760	6360760	What the...
6361760	6362760	Come on.
6362760	6363760	You guys are being...
6363760	6365760	I put my foot in it because I thought it wasn't.
6365760	6367760	Whose name's in the fucking marquee?
6368760	6369760	Well, there was a scene...
6369760	6370760	It's called Othello.
6371760	6372760	All right.
6372760	6373760	Then 10 years later...
6376760	6377760	Am I pregnant?
6378760	6380760	Not over 10 years, probably.
6381760	6382760	Desdemona!
6384760	6385760	Desdemona!
6388760	6389760	You remember me!
6390760	6392760	You shook my dick!
6393760	6394760	Yeah.
6394760	6395760	Okay.
6395760	6396760	I know you can hear me!
6396760	6397760	Yeah.
6397760	6398760	I'm a garbage man now!
6399760	6400760	You shook my dick!
6401760	6402760	Yeah.
6403760	6404760	Did you see that?
6404760	6405760	Hm-hmm!
6406760	6407760	Meep, meep, meep!
6409760	6410760	Hm-hmm!
6410760	6412760	Meep, meep, meep!
6414760	6415760	Wait.
6415760	6416760	I'm a...
6416760	6417760	It's an American car.
6420760	6423760	I apologize for an invisible car.
6423760	6425760	I don't know what side I'm on.
6425760	6428760	I feel a bit sort of objectified.
6429760	6430760	And I don't...
6430760	6431760	It's new for me.
6431760	6433760	I feel a bit sort of...
6433760	6435760	I sucked it.
6436760	6437760	I remember that happening.
6437760	6438760	I do.
6438760	6440760	Oh, my goodness, you did!
6440760	6441760	But just because I...
6442760	6443760	Keep talking!
6443760	6445760	You were monologue about it!
6446760	6449760	Just because I sucked it then doesn't mean I want to suck it now.
6449760	6451760	So it's like...
6451760	6452760	Because I'm a man, I'm a man.
6452760	6453760	Doesn't mean I want to suck it now.
6453760	6454760	So it's like...
6454760	6456760	Because I'm my own...
6456760	6458760	I'm a strong, independent woman.
6458760	6459760	Hi.
6459760	6460760	Hi, guys.
6460760	6462760	Oh, the master approaches.
6462760	6463760	Yes.
6463760	6464760	Hello.
6464760	6465760	Oh!
6465760	6466760	Foul handkerchief.
6474760	6477760	Scented with the spilled beer of Pamela.
6478760	6481760	I can't believe it sat here for ten long years.
6483760	6486760	Well, I was pushed to the periphery of my own story.
6496760	6500760	Oh, it's hard keeping the guides at this here castle.
6503760	6507760	All the thunder calls back ain't shit under thunder.
6508760	6511760	Oh, I mean Comic Relief will be studied in high school,
6511760	6513760	and no one will think it's funny,
6513760	6516760	but I'll be an example of Comic Relief.
6517760	6520760	You'll be taught what I'm doing is comedy.
6520760	6523760	Oh, Desdemona, I hope I did not break your iPhone
6523760	6525760	when I threw the foul handkerchief.
6526760	6528760	Okay, it's all good, it's all good.
6529760	6530760	Thank you.
6534760	6537760	No, we quite literally smashed my iPhone,
6538760	6540760	but it's been worth it.
6545760	6547760	As long as Pam's happy.
6553760	6557760	Also, I think I'm kind of a black guy as well.
6559760	6562760	Desdemona!
6563760	6566760	No, honestly, it's awful being a woman.
6567760	6569760	I get why she's so annoyed.
6570760	6571760	It's horrible.
6572760	6573760	I'm coming up.
6574760	6576760	I agree, you should make love to me.
6577760	6578760	No, don't lasso me.
6580760	6583760	It is as the constellations twirl
6583760	6589760	on the impenetrable finger of the gods of the action.
6590760	6595760	I am here to permit to myself the duty upon which is
6595760	6599760	to defile and conquer thee from love.
6600760	6604760	Where is the recipient of my giant hard-on?
6606760	6609760	Who will cushion the blow of my burden?
6610760	6615760	I, who was born from vagina, now cursed to walk the earth as penis,
6617760	6620760	must seek again vagina to take my day.
6622760	6623760	Forsooth?
6624760	6626760	The gods send a man?
6626760	6631760	I, tis so lowly comptroller that may have to end the show
6631760	6633760	with musical notes.
6633760	6640760	I'm still pretty sad about my phone, actually.
6640760	6643760	Were you reimbursed that?
6643760	6645760	That's just my...
6645760	6646760	We have insurance.
6646760	6648760	Does it really get broken?
6648760	6650760	It's not broken.
6650760	6652760	He's just being whiny now.
6652760	6654760	No, the screen's smashed.
6654760	6656760	It's not smashed.
6656760	6658760	If I look.
6658760	6660760	Let's not end the night with victim blaming.
6660760	6662760	I mean, let's...
6662760	6665760	I think we'd make great leaps forward tonight.
6665760	6667760	Gently. Gently this time.

6687760	6689760	I do get them for free, yeah.
6691760	6692760	Thank you.
6697760	6698760	I'll send the demon out.
6698760	6700760	Can I just end the show with that, or do it...
6701760	6705760	The Australian Commonwealth is entitled to their rap.
6705760	6707760	I think so.
6708760	6712760	The rhymes for the word Australia, you won't believe.
