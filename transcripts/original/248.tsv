0	16040	From beautiful Uptown Burbank, Hermitown is now in session.
16040	25120	Spencer Clifton.
25120	26120	What's in that bag?
27120	29120	Special stuff in that bag.
29120	30120	I don't know, man.
30120	33120	Let's bring out the mayor of Hermitown, Dan Harmon.
38120	40120	Thank you, thank you.
40120	42120	Wow, I think it's a new lighting setup, right?
42120	43120	Say what?
43120	46120	I assume the microphone's further back because it's part of a new lighting setup.
46120	47120	I don't know.
47120	50120	Why do I always start to show in the worst fucking way?
50120	58120	Not just the worst way, but just specifically in like really wondering about whether the microphone's position is important in some way.
58120	65120	Like whether it's intentional or haphazard is like, that's been a topic of discussion at the top of the show many times.
65120	69120	Yeah, I guess it's the first thing that I see.
69120	71120	Yeah, no, I'm sure that's why.
71120	73120	It's not a scripted show.
73120	75120	I don't have a plan to talk about anything.
75120	77120	I mean, I have a couple notes.
78120	87120	I passed a very important romantic threshold on my trip to New Orleans to celebrate Cody's mom's 70th birthday.
87120	89120	We went to this city.
90120	92120	New Orleans is great.
96120	97120	So you like music and food.
97120	98120	Who doesn't?
98120	100120	I don't understand that part of it.
100120	101120	I'm not yelling at them.
101120	104120	They've been through enough, but I just don't understand.
105120	107120	Who doesn't like music and food?
107120	117120	And if I go to your city that's famous for its food, say you got your Portland, let's say your Asheville, North Carolina we've been to, Austin, New Orleans.
117120	118120	The big food cities.
118120	121120	The food cities, where it's like, oh, all the food's good.
121120	122120	And it is.
122120	123120	We always go there.
123120	130120	If you go to these cities and open a bad restaurant, is it just the momentum of the capitalistic biosphere there?
130120	132120	Just people wouldn't go.
132120	133120	They go, this food's terrible.
133120	134120	I'm a Portlander.
134120	135120	I know the difference.
135120	136120	I'm not going to.
136120	137120	And then you would.
137120	141120	So like these are just cities that have created an ecosystem of foodism.
143120	147120	So you're mad at New Orleans for liking food and for liking music.
147120	148120	I'm just wondering if it's all a scam.
148120	154120	You know, you just say your city is at the home of good food and then people will just go, this is delicious.
154120	159120	Like I'm kind of suspicious of it because I ate a lot of things called like Creole omelets and they really tasted like omelets.
160120	162120	You're not supposed to get a Creole omelet.
162120	166120	You're supposed to get a bag of crawdads or some fucking, you know, a beignet and shit.
166120	169120	And what is this obsession with the saints marching in?
169120	172120	That's a really horrible song.
172120	174120	It's about the apocalypse.
174120	177120	It's an apocalyptic biblical song.
177120	178120	Right.
178120	179120	It's zealotry.
179120	181120	It's about picking the right team.
181120	183120	Anyways, that's not what I wanted to talk about.
183120	188120	I was in a hotel room and we were going to go out to breakfast.
188120	191120	And I didn't at any time.
191120	197120	And I suddenly noticed I never, as we were leaving the hotel room, I never asked.
197120	202120	I never made sure that both Cody and I had a key.
202120	205120	And I always did that.
205120	212120	I was married and I always I've never stayed in a hotel room with somebody and didn't make sure that we both had keys.
212120	213120	When we left the room.
213120	214120	Right.
214120	220120	So this symbolically, this means that something is I've let go of something in the back of my head as I leave a hotel room with Cody.
220120	223120	Like I'm like, I imagine we'll be coming back together.
223120	226120	Oh.
226120	231120	Or that's assuming we're coming back together no matter what.
231120	241120	Well, I mean, you could look at it as clingy, but I think it's I think it's more unhealthy than I was always like prepared for the event of coming home separately.
241120	242120	Right.
242120	251120	Like well into my marriage, I was still like, well, you know, stitch in time.
251120	255120	It's a weird thing to be prepared for, you know, like, well, you never know.
255120	258120	We could now you feel healthy because you like.
258120	261120	Yeah, it never even occurred to me like it was like the third time we went out.
261120	264120	I was like, oh, shit, I haven't I haven't had a hotel key this whole time.
264120	269120	I'm like totally comfortable being completely dependent on this woman.
270120	273120	See, it sounds pretty codependent.
273120	275120	Yeah, I mean, I think that's a good.
275120	280120	I think it's a good move in the right direction for me.
280120	282120	Yesterday was a good day.
282120	284120	You all know.
284120	286120	Did you have to use your AK?
286120	287120	Yes.
287120	289120	No, no, I didn't.
289120	292120	That was a good day.
292120	295120	But, you know, well, I did this.
295120	298120	I picked up my gun.
299120	300120	I now.
300120	302120	Did you use your AK or did you not use your AK?
302120	307120	I learned to field strip my Glock 19 in my bed and oil it.
307120	309120	So you finally got your gun.
309120	310120	Yeah.
310120	311120	Danny got his gun.
311120	312120	Yeah.
312120	318120	And it's amazing like guns are guns are amazing.
318120	322120	It's one of the greatest ways to shoot bullets.
322120	323120	That's the thing.
323120	327120	So that's the thing that was great because part of the safety manual or the owner's manual period is
328120	338120	first of all, let me explain how a gun works and what's happening when you pull the trigger so that you don't blow yourself up or someone else that you're not meaning to because it's a lethal weapon that you bought to put holes in people.
338120	341120	But let's make sure you don't put in the wrong person.
341120	342120	And so they explain how everything works.
342120	348120	And it kind of really sinks home because you the ammunition you buy by the bucket.
348120	352120	Like I said, oh, I guess I need some bullets for this.
352120	355120	And the lady said, how many buckets of ammunition?
355120	356120	Yeah.
356120	360120	And she's like, yeah, behind you, there's the target range bullets.
360120	363120	And then there's the home defense bullets.
363120	364120	Those are more expensive.
364120	365120	Why?
365120	369120	Because they because the target range bullets will just go through walls and stuff.
369120	374120	So even though they're kind of more dangerous, they're cheaper.
374120	381120	The more expensive bullets are the ones that are just for shooting a someone just explode inside of human body.
381120	382120	Yeah.
382120	383120	That's what I was thinking.
383120	386120	I was like, do they like lob out and like land on the burglar?
386120	392120	But no, it's probably is that they're just like made of different stuff and they're not like going through the shooting.
392120	396120	The gun range bullets are more deadly than than cheaper.
396120	399120	And you buy I bought a paint bucket full of bullets.
399120	404120	That's it. And that's just an interesting sideline in this world of mass shootings and stuff.
404120	410120	When they say the they go and they look in the trunk of the person and they say, look how much ammunition they had.
410120	412120	But you know, you buy this stuff in bulk.
412120	420120	And the odd thing to me is that these guns, they're basically staplers that that have a little you put a little rocket in them.
420120	426120	And and it's got it's got a bunch of explosive in it like a stapler.
426120	433120	Well, the gun part is like a stapler up until the point where instead of a stapler, there's a fucking tiny rocket.
433120	437120	So that's my point is like Chris Rock has that joke about we don't need gun control.
437120	438120	We need bullet control.
438120	440120	That would be the solutions to make bullets really expensive.
440120	443120	But I'm not making that same joke.
443120	447120	But I am saying, like, isn't it fucking weird that we don't regulate bullet?
447120	449120	Like you could walk into that store.
449120	451120	I don't need a license to just buy these things.
451120	454120	Like ostensibly, I can go home and make a gun.
454120	457120	People make guns in prisons out of like bunk bed legs.
457120	459120	Like I saw Hill Street Blues once.
459120	462120	There was a guy he was like, I got to get like a zip gun or something.
462120	469120	He's holding like a little toothbrush thing he made as long as it hits the firing pin.
469120	471120	Pin receiver thing on the back.
471120	473120	The primer cap.
473120	475120	Dan, you can talk the talk.
475120	478120	That's the thing that kills you.
478120	481120	There's a bucket of little rockets in my bedroom.
481120	485120	And it was like eight bucks for a thousand of them or something.
485120	488120	And it's like those things kill babies.
488120	491120	This gun is just like you take it apart like John Wick.
491120	493120	You learn how to do that to clean it.
493120	496120	And that's when you realize all those movies, you know,
496120	500120	you see the movies where the guy grabs the gun and field strips it with one hand.
500120	502120	Like the slider fly.
502120	504120	You can't. Come on.
504120	510120	If a guy did that, if I was a thug and I was like patrolling a drug lair
510120	515120	and a guy in a trench coat that was like the hero came around the corner
515120	518120	and he grabbed the gun, I'd be like, oh, fuck.
518120	520120	God, you're good.
520120	524120	But then if he like stripped it, like took it apart really fast,
524120	527120	he'd be like, okay, what are you, a magician?
527120	531120	What are you spending your time on learning how to do that?
531120	534120	Then maybe I should try to grab the gun back.
534120	540120	That's like if you grabbed your gun and then did a card trick or something.
540120	544120	The best time to take a gun away from somebody is when it's taken apart.
544120	546120	It's the safest time.
546120	548120	Well, it'd be easier.
548120	550120	Anyways, I'm just saying.
550120	553120	Also, I like that you think that bullets are rockets.
553120	555120	They have a little combustible thing.
555120	557120	They have a little cartridge of gunpowder.
557120	559120	I mean, it's like that's the part that kills you.
559120	562120	What size gun do you have? What's the ammunition you have?
562120	564120	It's a 9-millimeter.
564120	567120	And I'm sorry, I know I stimulated the market.
567120	568120	I'm part of the problem.
568120	574120	We've had gun violence just this last week and here I am like stimulating that market.
574120	577120	It's like, for instance, if I was going to have someone up to talk about this
577120	580120	amazing movie that has a very pro-vegetarian kind of vibe
580120	584120	and I've been eating fucking sausage like crazy after.
584120	586120	Yeah, we're part of the problem.
586120	588120	When we vote with our dollars, I bought a gun.
588120	591120	But I have no excuse.
591120	593120	I'm just scared.
593120	595120	I'm like, I'm doomsday prepping.
595120	598120	We got ham radio instruction manuals.
598120	602120	Man, yeah, I'm learning how to do ham radios.
602120	604120	This shit's hard, man.
604120	605120	There's a ham radio store.
605120	608120	It was so much easier for you to just get the gun.
609120	611120	It was so easy to get the gun.
611120	613120	And then we went to the ham radio store and the guy's like,
613120	615120	all right, what's going on here?
615120	619120	Tell me what you want and I'll tell you how you can get it a month from now.
619120	621120	And it was like crazy.
621120	623120	We bought for $30.
623120	626120	Yeah, his position was like trying to,
626120	629120	it was like a secret club where he was trying to not tip his hand
629120	633120	but gauge where we were on the totem pole of ham radio.
633120	634120	Right.
634120	636120	Because there is a totem pole of ham radio.
636120	638120	And it has like three or four tiers.
638120	640120	But you can be mentally ill and buy a gun.
640120	641120	Oh, yeah.
641120	644120	Yeah, and they're lifting those regulations like crazy.
644120	647120	Those people have lost their minds.
647120	650120	You don't even need to pass background checks half the time
650120	652120	because like background checks can get expedited.
652120	655120	And if they go, I mean, this is certain states.
655120	658120	But if they, like if at a certain time period lapse,
658120	660120	they'll just go, oh, it's been too long.
660120	662120	Let's not do a background check anymore.
662120	665120	And then so people just get guns without background checks.
666120	667120	It's great.
667120	671120	So yesterday was a good day because I was like,
671120	675120	I'm just on this crazy roller coaster where I swear,
675120	677120	I have to be totally honest and just say,
677120	681120	if President Trump is upset, I am happy.
681120	684120	And if he's happy, I'm just depressed.
684120	686120	I can't do anything.
686120	690120	So if he's tweeting like, hey, I don't know.
690120	693120	If he's just like spiking his little toddler football,
693120	695120	I'll just have a bad day all day.
695120	699120	But then, yeah, two days ago, it was like this great morning
699120	702120	because he had that tweet about how he was under investigation
702120	705120	and he's like throwing his fire truck around the room.
705120	706120	And it just felt good.
706120	710120	And all of the articles were about like it's closing in on him
710120	711120	and he's under investigation.
711120	712120	I can't believe he admitted it.
712120	713120	What a dummy.
713120	716120	And all this stuff and just all the refreshed
716120	718120	on all the threads of how we're going to prove
718120	719120	that he colluded with the Russians.
719120	721120	This isn't conspiracy theory.
721120	722120	This is a real thing.
722120	725120	And now we're going to get his financials and blah, blah, blah,
725120	726120	and all this stuff.
726120	727120	It just felt really good.
727120	729120	And then this morning, it was like his lawyer says
729120	730120	he's not under investigation.
730120	732120	And I was just like, what the fuck?
732120	733120	That's why I got the gun.
733120	737120	I got the gun because the only thing I understand
737120	738120	is that I'm out of control.
738120	741120	And I don't know if you know how hard it
741120	745120	is to be white and male and fragile.
745120	748120	And you said before that, if you had to kill yourself,
748120	749120	you'd do it with a gun, right?
749120	751120	Yeah, I did say.
752120	753120	Yeah.
753120	755120	I don't know how I feel about it.
755120	760120	People don't realize how much the real heroes of Handmaid's Tale
760120	763120	are the commanders.
763120	765120	I have a question about Handmaid's Tale.
768120	772120	Why is it part of the point of that dystopia
772120	774120	that even the men are miserable?
774120	777120	Because isn't it a dystopic thing,
777120	779120	where it's like the patriarchy is out of control
779120	782120	and the women are just objects of fertility
782120	784120	and servants and things.
784120	787120	And they don't have rights anymore.
787120	793120	But there's no men lighting cigars with women's hair
793120	796120	and going like, I love having balls.
796120	799120	They're all bummed out because they have to fuck their babysitter
799120	802120	when they're looking at their wife.
802120	804120	And everyone's sad.
804120	806120	I'm like, what kind of patriarchy is this?
807120	812120	Shouldn't it look at least like a little bit like 60s Playboy club
812120	814120	to their Lorraine little tales
814120	820120	and the conception sessions are private and involve music?
822120	826120	I wish we could just find a dystopia where we could have fun.
827120	830120	But that makes me wonder, is that part of the commentary,
830120	834120	that it's not just about, oh, if men had their way,
834120	835120	it would be awful.
835120	837120	It's more about, look what we do to ourselves.
837120	840120	The patriarchy is the patriarchy
840120	843120	because it's not self-aware enough to understand what it wants
843120	844120	and doesn't want.
844120	847120	We'll all land ourselves if we continue to follow this path.
847120	851120	If we use the excuses of religion and things like that
851120	854120	and gender identity to construct a society
854120	855120	where everyone gets to do what they want,
855120	857120	nobody's going to get to do what they want.
857120	860120	Everyone's going to be all bummed out and under pressure.
860120	862120	And it would be better if we just relaxed,
862120	865120	even if we were a little infertile.
873120	874120	I agree.
875120	877120	My other question is, in the book,
877120	880120	after she plays Scrabble with him,
880120	882120	does it have like the 80s needle drop
882120	885120	while she walks in slow-mo like in Mean Girls?
885120	887120	I felt like it was mixed messaging,
887120	890120	but I'm not a guy, but I'm enjoying the show.
891120	892120	I am a guy.
894120	897120	I am a guy and am enjoying the show.
898120	900120	Damn, it's okay to not be a guy.
903120	904120	But we are kind of behind.
904120	907120	We haven't watched Handmaid's Tale for a while.
907120	908120	So maybe we didn't enjoy it.
908120	911120	Maybe we got turned off by the Mean Girls slow-mo walks.
911120	913120	Maybe we bailed on it.
913120	914120	Maybe we were like, what is this?
914120	915120	What's going on?
915120	916120	Let's watch Wizard of Lies.
916120	917120	Why is it called Wizard of Lies?
917120	919120	Is it supposed to sound like Wizard of Lies?
919120	920120	What are they going for?
922120	923120	Why is this a non-linear story
923120	925120	if the whole thing takes place in an apartment?
930120	931120	How's your book coming along?
933120	935120	I'm working very hard on it.
936120	937120	It's almost done.
937120	938120	It's almost done.
938120	939120	Just shut up.
939120	940120	They're going to sue the fuck out of me.
945120	946120	And when I'm working hard on it,
946120	949120	I had to go back and rewrite part of the introduction
949120	951120	where I was like, I'm introducing a book.
951120	952120	Okay, hold on.
952120	953120	The election's on.
953120	954120	What the fuck?
954120	956120	There's no such thing as a book that you started
956120	958120	before the fucking election.
959120	961120	A lot of creatives are going through this.
961120	963120	There's also positive effects of the election
963120	965120	where I'm finding as I work with writers
965120	967120	and different stuff where we're breaking stories
967120	969120	about a snowman that comes alive
969120	971120	or a robot that fucks a shoe.
971120	975120	Whatever it is, even if it has nothing to do with politics,
975120	978120	there's been a 10% decrease
978120	980120	in the need for suspension of disbelief.
980120	981120	Does that make sense?
982120	984120	It's just across the board, like all writers.
984120	985120	I'm not kidding.
985120	986120	It sounds like a joke,
986120	987120	but it's like on every single project
987120	989120	that I started before the election
989120	991120	and now I'm working on after the election
991120	993120	and we're having trouble with stories and stuff,
993120	996120	we just go like, wait, so can't he just be a time traveler?
996120	998120	And then they go, yeah, why did we rule that out?
998120	1002120	Oh, because, yeah, that was before the singularity
1002120	1003120	started glitching out.
1004120	1008120	And like, wait, why don't we just have her say,
1008120	1011120	snowman, snowman, come alive, man,
1011120	1013120	and she could just walk up the walls
1013120	1015120	like Lionel Richie and...
1018120	1019120	Put the ceiling fan on her head
1019120	1022120	and fly out the skylight like Inspector Gadget.
1022120	1024120	Why didn't we think of that before?
1024120	1025120	I don't know.
1025120	1028120	What was blocking us before?
1030120	1031120	Anything can happen.
1031120	1032120	I got a gun.
1032120	1035120	Yeah, I'm gonna fucking kill myself with it.
1035120	1036120	Don't do that.
1036120	1037120	Eventually.
1037120	1038120	No, don't.
1038120	1040120	You want me to die of a stomach ulcer?
1040120	1041120	Yeah.
1042120	1045120	Oh, man, I hope you die of a stomach ulcer.
1047120	1049120	Can they kill you?
1049120	1050120	A stomach ulcer?
1050120	1051120	Can you die of an ulcer?
1051120	1052120	No.
1052120	1054120	Well, you get stomach.
1054120	1055120	An unintended stomach ulcer
1055120	1057120	could create stomach cancer, I guess.
1057120	1058120	No.
1058120	1059120	Do you have ulcers?
1059120	1060120	I assume I have ulcers.
1061120	1063120	No, I don't feel anything in my tum-tum.
1063120	1066120	I have horrible heartburn.
1066120	1068120	Chronic, horrible heartburn.
1068120	1072120	It's got to be just 40 years of just soaking my esophageal flap
1072120	1074120	in vodka has made it kind of...
1074120	1076120	I can tell because if I eat popcorn,
1076120	1080120	I now have to consciously breathe
1080120	1083120	then eat the popcorn and then not breathe while I'm eating the popcorn.
1083120	1087120	If I'm watching a movie where a voorhees
1087120	1089120	or something comes around the corner and I go...
1089120	1095120	The popcorn's going straight into every, like, alveoli balloon.
1095120	1100120	Like, I just have lungs full of popcorn that are just disintegrating.
1100120	1105120	There's, like, dormant tuberculosis in there, like, eating the popcorn.
1105120	1107120	I didn't know. What did I do right?
1112120	1113120	So you got to be careful.
1113120	1115120	You seem a little down.
1115120	1117120	You said yesterday was a good day or today was a good day.
1117120	1119120	Yeah, today's a bad day because it's just like,
1119120	1122120	oh, I'm not under investigation. You can't control this guy.
1122120	1125120	He said he's just a big...
1125120	1128120	There's a baby. There's a baby on a motorcycle,
1128120	1135120	like driving in a bullet store
1135120	1139120	with these swinging firing pins around in the bag.
1139120	1141120	Throwing them everywhere.
1141120	1144120	I mean, a baby in a motorcycle in a bullet store,
1144120	1146120	it's not going to set the bullets off.
1146120	1148120	And maybe that's why the bullets aren't dangerous
1148120	1149120	because nothing can.
1149120	1152120	It just seems to me, like, if you look at the mechanism of a gun,
1152120	1154120	the firing pin goes...
1154120	1155120	It's just like a thing.
1155120	1157120	It just seems like you could fire a bullet
1157120	1159120	by hitting it real hard with a hairpin.
1159120	1160120	Yeah, yeah.
1160120	1163120	Like, wait, if you had pliers and a small hammer,
1163120	1165120	you'd give a gun a go bang.
1165120	1166120	Yeah.
1166120	1167120	Shoot so much.
1167120	1169120	Yeah.
1169120	1172120	You never hear about those shootings.
1172120	1174120	Have you shot your gun yet? Have you taken it to the range?
1174120	1176120	No, no, because I don't have...
1176120	1178120	I want to, like, learn to use it.
1178120	1179120	Yeah.
1179120	1181120	There's a firing range nearby here,
1181120	1184120	and they have, like, a weekend gun safety class,
1184120	1186120	but I don't know, man.
1186120	1187120	I don't...
1187120	1189120	The last place I want to be is, like,
1189120	1196120	a group of weekend intro gun safety class humans.
1196120	1198120	Also, people keep going into gun ranges
1198120	1200120	and killing themselves because you get a gun,
1200120	1201120	and it's free.
1201120	1202120	And it's free. It's cheap.
1202120	1204120	People just keep blowing their heads off.
1204120	1205120	Well, that's fine, though.
1205120	1207120	That's just part of the territory.
1207120	1208120	That's just the price of admission.
1208120	1210120	Yeah, yeah.
1210120	1213120	Sometimes you get, like, a chicken and your egg McMuffin.
1213120	1215120	Yeah.
1217120	1220120	That probably doesn't happen.
1220120	1224120	All right. Anyways, yeah.
1224120	1225120	I want...
1225120	1227120	I mean, I'll bring up our friend now,
1227120	1230120	our new friend that I met at a Netflix screening
1230120	1234120	for this movie that's coming out, Okja.
1234120	1235120	It's...
1235120	1236120	God damn it.
1236120	1241120	It's Bongjoonho.
1241120	1243120	Did I get that name right?
1243120	1246120	Okay. Bong is the first name.
1246120	1249120	There's, like, a thing where the people that refer
1249120	1252120	to working with him on set is, like, a part of Korean culture.
1252120	1254120	You call him Director Bong.
1254120	1256120	That is, like, kind of fun.
1256120	1257120	I don't know.
1257120	1258120	That is fun.
1258120	1260120	I wish we had that.
1260120	1262120	If you're a director or a...
1262120	1265120	You should be called, like, Writer Harmon, like, or Writer Dan.
1265120	1269120	Yeah, I don't know. I'd like it.
1269120	1272120	And then all the fertile women, we can round them up,
1272120	1275120	dress them like nuns.
1275120	1279120	Put in a sizzling red color.
1279120	1282120	Sizzling.
1282120	1286120	Red nuns is hot.
1286120	1287120	They're the handmaids.
1287120	1289120	They're, like, red nuns.
1289120	1291120	But only when they're going to buy oranges.
1291120	1293120	Like, they also have to buy oranges for everybody?
1293120	1294120	Okay, all right.
1294120	1296120	I'll work up my dystopia.
1296120	1298120	It's got third act problems.
1298120	1302120	But anyways, this is a friend of Cody's who was there.
1302120	1304120	That's why we were at the screening.
1304120	1305120	And because I was at the screening,
1305120	1306120	I didn't know anything about the movie.
1306120	1308120	I never saw a trailer.
1308120	1310120	So my mind was fucking blown by this movie,
1310120	1312120	so I was like, come talk about it,
1312120	1314120	even though you guys haven't had a chance to see it yet.
1314120	1316120	It's coming to Netflix next week.
1316120	1319120	But let's welcome our new friend, Christina Oh.
1319120	1331120	Oh, thank you.
1331120	1335120	Christina brought a foam Okja.
1335120	1337120	Hi.
1337120	1340120	Oh, she fell.
1340120	1342120	A foam what? What is that?
1342120	1344120	It's a super pig.
1344120	1346120	Oh, it's a super pig.
1346120	1349120	Okja, and the movie is a super pig
1349120	1352120	created by a corporation to genetically modify it
1352120	1355120	in order to solve world hunger.
1355120	1356120	These aren't spoilers, right?
1356120	1357120	This is the first five minutes of the movie.
1357120	1359120	They explained it all.
1359120	1364120	And so there's giant pigs that are being tested,
1364120	1369120	and the story follows the ownership
1369120	1373120	of one giant pig, Okja, and her owner.
1373120	1374120	What's her name?
1374120	1375120	Mija.
1375120	1376120	Mija.
1376120	1379120	Anyways, and I saw you after the movie,
1379120	1382120	and I was like, I think that was a perfect movie.
1382120	1384120	I think it was a 10% Gyllenhaal reduction.
1384120	1386120	People are going to say he's over the top,
1386120	1388120	but I didn't care.
1388120	1391120	But I don't know why I qualified it with that,
1391120	1393120	but it's because truly I wanted to,
1393120	1396120	I really thought it was a perfect movie.
1397120	1399120	And then you were shocked to hear that,
1399120	1401120	and it seemed like so was Bong.
1401120	1403120	Can I call him Bong?
1403120	1404120	You have to call him Director Bong.
1404120	1406120	Director Bong.
1406120	1408120	Right, so the last name comes first,
1408120	1410120	is the formality, right?
1410120	1412120	Yeah, it's a very honorific culture.
1412120	1413120	Yeah.
1413120	1414120	I'm going to eat that mic.
1414120	1417120	Dan's setting a bad example because this mic's way hot.
1417120	1418120	Oh, sorry.
1418120	1419120	Oh, because my mic's hot.
1419120	1421120	No, it's just picking you up from really far away.
1421120	1423120	Yeah, your mic's not as hot,
1423120	1425120	because we're in an honorific culture too.
1425120	1427120	So the male gets the better mic.
1427120	1429120	There's a glass ceiling on your mic decibels.
1429120	1431120	Okay, I will put it.
1431120	1434120	I got to get up on mine too.
1434120	1435120	See, I'm like right here.
1435120	1436120	But don't cover it with your hand.
1436120	1437120	Yeah, there you go.
1437120	1438120	Okay.
1438120	1439120	Unless you're going to beatbox.
1439120	1440120	Then I find that that helps,
1440120	1441120	because it helps the P's not popping.
1441120	1443120	It looks cool too.
1443120	1444120	Oh, jaw.
1444120	1446120	Oh, oh, oh, jaw.
1449120	1452120	So this movie was co-written by Director Bong and...
1452120	1453120	John Ronson.
1453120	1454120	No, tell us about him.
1454120	1455120	John?
1455120	1456120	Yeah.
1456120	1457120	Was he there at the screening?
1457120	1459120	He was not.
1459120	1460120	He was not.
1460120	1461120	He's cool though.
1461120	1462120	He's an author.
1462120	1465120	Well, he's a well-reviewed author,
1465120	1469120	and he's known Bong forever, Director Bong forever.
1469120	1471120	And then he came up with this,
1471120	1473120	or Director Bong came up with this crazy idea.
1473120	1476120	I think driving down a countryside,
1476120	1478120	and he saw this billboard,
1478120	1480120	or he saw this animal and was just like,
1480120	1484120	oh, you know, what's it doing out in the middle of nowhere?
1484120	1485120	What was that animal?
1485120	1486120	He mentioned that,
1486120	1488120	but he didn't mention the species of animal.
1488120	1489120	I don't know.
1489120	1490120	It's so weird that he doesn't...
1490120	1492120	I just think some sort of cute animal thing in Korea.
1492120	1493120	Yeah.
1495120	1500120	So the movie, it's not going to be theatrically released.
1500120	1501120	Well, we're going to...
1501120	1505120	So Netflix will do a day and date on June 28th,
1505120	1507120	and it will play in IPIC theaters in L.A.
1507120	1510120	for like a week or so, but no.
1510120	1513120	We want you to go watch it on Netflix.
1513120	1516120	And he talked about that a little bit,
1516120	1519120	and he was answering questions through a translator.
1519120	1523120	He speaks fine enough English to do conversative stuff,
1523120	1528120	but what I was gleaning was that every director probably wants their movie
1528120	1531120	to be on every theater screen in the world on Friday night,
1531120	1533120	and everyone would go out and eat popcorn and watch it.
1533120	1536120	It'll be a while before people get used to that
1536120	1539120	not being the case, but it was worth it,
1539120	1542120	the lack of that, to work with Netflix.
1542120	1546120	This is an unpaid plug, because they're really...
1546120	1550120	I don't want to make them sound irresponsible,
1550120	1554120	but they give you money, and they kind of let you do your thing.
1554120	1555120	Well, that's kind of the reason why.
1555120	1559120	Okay, so once you see this film, you'll realize, like, holy shit,
1559120	1563120	who would have given these people this amount of money to go make this movie?
1563120	1564120	It was a crazy thing.
1565120	1566120	Imagine going to a pitch and being like,
1566120	1570120	all right, so there's this girl and her best friend,
1570120	1573120	this genetically modified pig, and gets taken from her,
1573120	1578120	and she's a visual effect.
1578120	1581120	Give us several million dollars to make this.
1581120	1583120	But also it's rated R.
1583120	1584120	And it's rated R.
1584120	1586120	That's the big thing.
1586120	1591120	It's a big, giant CG pig that you fall in love with the first moment you see it.
1592120	1594120	It's a horrible rated R movie.
1594120	1595120	It is.
1595120	1598120	I mean, I can't even imagine any other studio being like,
1598120	1601120	yes, Director Bong, here's a check.
1601120	1603120	But that's why I really think it's a masterpiece.
1603120	1604120	And also something...
1604120	1607120	When I was watching it, I was like, oh, so this is a Snowpiercer guy.
1607120	1610120	I started watching Snowpiercer, and then I was like,
1610120	1614120	ah, there's tonal incompatibilities with me here.
1614120	1617120	It's hard enough to write a comedy or an action movie.
1617120	1619120	I don't want this goofiness happening in my action movies.
1619120	1621120	And I kind of drifted away from it, and I was like,
1621120	1624120	I bet that's just a thing when East meets West, like filmically.
1624120	1627120	And then when I watched this movie, I was like, wait, no,
1627120	1631120	is this guy like the Coen brothers or anybody else that we put in that category
1631120	1633120	where he's fucking with us?
1633120	1635120	He deliberately...
1635120	1639120	He's evolving now, or maybe this movie just makes it clearer
1639120	1642120	that he really deliberately plays with tone
1642120	1647120	in order to take you from laughter to horrible facing the abyss.
1647120	1648120	He's master at that.
1648120	1650120	If you've watched any of his other films,
1650120	1653120	he did this film called Mother, and earlier did Memories of Murder,
1653120	1657120	and then he did this Korean film called The Host,
1657120	1660120	which the first time I saw it, I was like, what is this?
1660120	1663120	And it's like this horror movie wrapped up in comedic bits.
1663120	1665120	And one scene that I feel like wraps...
1665120	1668120	For me, that wrapped him up was in that particular movie.
1668120	1673120	There's a scene where the father figure is explaining to his kids
1673120	1678120	why the third particular youngest son is kind of seemingly messed up
1678120	1679120	and doesn't have his life together.
1679120	1683120	And he's like, you know, we were so poor when he was little
1683120	1685120	and I couldn't feed him proper protein,
1685120	1688120	so that's why your brother's a little slower than you guys.
1688120	1691120	And he's really burying his soul,
1691120	1694120	and then the camera pans to the other brother and sister and they're sleeping.
1694120	1696120	It's just like those tonal shifts
1696120	1699120	where he's trying to open up and be emotional about something,
1699120	1702120	but the world is not hearing it.
1702120	1706120	And it kind of reminds me of Almadovar in that sense.
1706120	1711120	And I don't know how much of that is the effect of watching a foreign film
1711120	1716120	that blends a little comedy with thought-provoking weird shaky shit.
1716120	1720120	That's what I'm trying to figure out as a Western viewer
1720120	1723120	is how much of this is one person's genius
1723120	1728120	and how much of it is just the weird effect of a movie
1728120	1731120	translating across international borders.
1731120	1734120	I need a little bit of both, and if you know anything about Director Bong,
1734120	1738120	he is like, I think growing up in Korea,
1738120	1743120	which had a very military kind of regime for a long time when he was growing up,
1743120	1745120	I don't know if he wants me to say this,
1745120	1749120	but he was arrested for protesting in the 90s and stuff like that.
1749120	1753120	He is intrinsically, I think, a person who has something to say
1753120	1756120	about the way the system works and kind of fighting against him.
1756120	1758120	This is kind of his way of doing it.
1758120	1760120	I don't want to put words in his mouth,
1760120	1762120	but that's kind of how I read it.
1762120	1765120	This film, I think the underlying message,
1765120	1771120	of course it's about friendship and this little girl and bringing her family back
1771120	1775120	and having to come to terms with adults and grow up really quickly
1775120	1778120	in the span of a week or however long this film takes place,
1778120	1784120	but it also has this kind of nod to the greed
1784120	1788120	and horrible nature of capitalism.
1788120	1790120	But you're never preached to.
1790120	1792120	That's what I'm trying to figure out how to tell people
1792120	1795120	because the truth is if I read the description of this on paper,
1795120	1797120	I don't think I would.
1797120	1799120	I'd be like, well, when am I going to be in the mood
1799120	1804120	to be told that every time I eat bacon that something horrible is happening?
1804120	1807120	I'll put that on my list.
1807120	1811120	But because I just wandered into this movie and saw it,
1811120	1815120	I was just like, I want to tell people you don't have to worry about that.
1815120	1822120	It is heart-wrenching, but only in the same way that kind of E.T. is.
1822120	1829120	And I guess it's sort of like, what if E.T. was delicious?
1829120	1834120	It would just make E.T. kind of extra, you'd be rooting for Elliot to fly a little more.
1834120	1836120	Spoilers, Elliot flies.
1836120	1840120	E.T.'s kind of a piece of shit. This movie's really good.
1840120	1844120	I mean, there's definitely a lot of, you can sense the,
1844120	1849120	there's like a half dozen movies that you could feel a real genuine influence from
1849120	1850120	without being derivative.
1850120	1855120	You feel this whole E.T. thing, but you also feel this King Kong.
1855120	1859120	King Kong, like Pete's dragon if you go down there.
1859120	1864120	I would say that a big props, though, goes to our visual effects supervisor,
1864120	1867120	Eric DeBoer, just putting it out there.
1867120	1870120	He helped create this magnificent creature.
1870120	1875120	I've never worked on a film where we've had this amount of CG.
1875120	1877120	I mean, World War Z was a different thing,
1877120	1883120	but this was like the main character, the star of the film, is a visual effect.
1883120	1884120	Yeah.
1884120	1890120	So how do you create that bond between this little girl and this made-up creature
1890120	1893120	and make it believable and touching?
1893120	1895120	I've seen the movie probably like 20 times now,
1895120	1898120	and every single time at the end I'm like crying.
1898120	1901120	And it's kind of remarkable in terms of like...
1901120	1904120	I found myself crying because the movie was so good.
1904120	1907120	Sometimes I was like, not because it was sad narratively.
1907120	1911120	There were those times then, too, where I could hear Cody sniffling,
1911120	1914120	and I was like, if I look at her, then she'll see that I'm crying.
1914120	1921120	But I don't want to oversell it, but, you know, hey, everybody watch this
1921120	1926120	and tell me I'm insane if it's not actually this big a deal, this movie.
1926120	1932120	But I found myself near tears because of the action sometimes,
1932120	1936120	because I was like, yes, this is how you do it.
1936120	1940120	It's a little girl, and she's trying to save her pig.
1940120	1947120	But it's not cloyingly like, oh, she's a little girl, but she's a powerpuff girl.
1947120	1950120	She's got big, strong powers.
1950120	1954120	She's a little girl, and she's really at odds with the physical world,
1954120	1958120	but she just is flinging herself literally and figuratively
1958120	1962120	at this giant machine called humanity.
1962120	1968120	And what I was most impressed by was there's these action scenes
1968120	1971120	where if she's chasing a...
1971120	1976120	You can see her making decisions about physically what she should try to do next.
1976120	1979120	So you feel like you're playing like an 80s laser just video game or something,
1979120	1982120	because you actually are with her in that she's like,
1982120	1984120	you know, am I going to try to jump on this truck?
1984120	1986120	Yeah, I think I should, but I didn't.
1986120	1990120	Typically in action movies, there's a little bit of suspension of like,
1990120	1993120	oh, how did you know that you were going to...
1993120	1996120	You're just improvising, and so you decided to jump,
1996120	1998120	and now you're going to land on that truck.
1998120	2000120	But it's like there's a slight difference between that,
2000120	2002120	and I do this all the time, by the way.
2002120	2004120	It's called dance planning.
2004120	2006120	I'm a terrible interviewer.
2006120	2008120	I just bring people up, and I just talk.
2008120	2010120	I coined that.
2010120	2012120	But do you know, from working with him,
2012120	2014120	is that a conscious thing when he's doing action
2014120	2017120	that he wants people to track the choices?
2017120	2020120	Okay, well, another thing about Director Bong
2020120	2023120	is he's like a director who never worked with him before.
2023120	2027120	This guy's like remarkably meticulous in the way he shoots.
2027120	2031120	So every sequence or every whatever,
2031120	2033120	the entire script is basically storyboarded.
2033120	2036120	So I land in Korea, and you're basically handed this book
2036120	2039120	of the entire movie that's storyboarded shot for shot.
2039120	2040120	It was insane.
2040120	2042120	And then the night before, we get our call sheets,
2042120	2045120	and with them are the boards for the next day
2045120	2047120	with exactly what's going to happen.
2047120	2050120	So it was kind of crazy, because you already knew,
2050120	2052120	and you already knew what it would look like,
2052120	2054120	and then you would direct a scene,
2054120	2058120	and it was exactly like those boards, what was drawn.
2058120	2060120	And a lot of people were like,
2060120	2062120	oh, that does that give you creative freedom or whatever?
2062120	2063120	But it does, I think.
2063120	2065120	If you hear some of the actors talk about it,
2065120	2068120	they're like, we knew exactly what we needed to do,
2068120	2072120	so then we could kind of have freedom within those parameters.
2072120	2075120	And then the little girl, Mija, who's played by An Seo Hyun,
2075120	2077120	was just remarkable.
2077120	2080120	She's like this incredible kid,
2080120	2083120	and did everything so beautifully,
2083120	2085120	and then would just go and do it,
2085120	2086120	and she'd be playing in the corner,
2086120	2087120	and then he'd be like, action,
2087120	2090120	and then she'd go run down the street,
2090120	2091120	and then he'd be like, cut,
2091120	2094120	and then she'd be like, where's the snack truck?
2094120	2097120	I think people are going to freak out most about her,
2097120	2100120	because people are freaking out about the little girl in Logan
2100120	2102120	who's so amazing and so striking,
2102120	2105120	and she's doing so much with so little dialogue and stuff.
2105120	2108120	She's just glaring at Hugh Jackman and holding her own.
2108120	2112120	But this little girl is doing these scenes with Paul Dano,
2112120	2116120	who I was never like, hey, sign me up for the Paul Dano fan club,
2116120	2118120	nor was I a hater.
2118120	2120120	I would see him and I'd go, who's that guy?
2120120	2122120	His face is kind of weird.
2123120	2125120	But he is fucking amazing.
2125120	2127120	I wanted to marry him.
2127120	2130120	His character, that's the other thing.
2130120	2131120	Again, I'm doing it again.
2131120	2132120	I'm not asking you anything.
2132120	2133120	Keep going.
2133120	2135120	That character is deeply flawed,
2135120	2137120	but he's so righteous,
2137120	2140120	and it's in his relationship with the girl.
2140120	2146120	I loved the internationality of the story.
2146120	2148120	I love that it's part of the story
2148120	2151120	that some people speak Korean and English,
2151120	2153120	some people only speak Korean,
2153120	2155120	some people only speak English.
2155120	2157120	That was kind of another aspect of the film
2157120	2159120	that we wanted to touch upon.
2159120	2161120	I think Director Bond likes to have these characters
2161120	2163120	that are conflicting.
2163120	2165120	There's this animal liberation front,
2165120	2169120	and they're a group with well-intentioned meanings,
2169120	2173120	wanting to save this pig and expose this evil corporation
2173120	2176120	and how they had created all these things,
2176120	2178120	like super pigs that are just fucked up
2178120	2181120	and they're having a terrible time.
2181120	2183120	They're terrorists.
2183120	2185120	There's a group of terrorists in the movie,
2185120	2187120	and they're the good guys.
2187120	2190120	There really is an ALS, that's an actual thing.
2190120	2192120	Is it based on the actual thing?
2192120	2194120	I think it's not like a direct,
2194120	2196120	it just happened to be,
2196120	2198120	I think it came from his cousin,
2198120	2200120	an activist or something.
2200120	2205120	But anyway, they themselves are very conflicting characters,
2205120	2207120	especially Stephen Young's character,
2207120	2209120	who is Korean-American,
2209120	2211120	and he speaks Korean in the film,
2211120	2213120	but he's terrible at translating.
2213120	2214120	His character is.
2214120	2215120	His character is.
2215120	2217120	I mean, in real life.
2217120	2218120	I'm just kidding.
2218120	2219120	He's Korean's really good.
2219120	2220120	His Korean's really good.
2220120	2222120	So they have these conflicting characters
2222120	2227120	where they really mean well,
2227120	2228120	but they're kind of like a group
2228120	2231120	of just like bumbling idiots at times.
2231120	2232120	Yeah.
2232120	2233120	I mean, they're pure of heart.
2233120	2234120	It's hard to say.
2234120	2236120	It's that archetype where the people show up
2236120	2237120	and they're kind of like, they're goofy,
2237120	2238120	but they're heroes.
2238120	2241120	Even Jake's character is like a deeply, deeply,
2241120	2243120	I don't know if you got that,
2243120	2246120	but he's like a deeply flawed person
2246120	2248120	who started out as like this,
2248120	2252120	you know, Steve Irwin-esque kind of like animal lover
2252120	2254120	and then has just been beaten down
2254120	2256120	by this woman for the past like,
2256120	2259120	Tilda's character for the past like 10 years.
2259120	2260120	He's like the shell of a man who he was
2260120	2262120	and he's just kind of taking it out on.
2262120	2263120	Yeah.
2263120	2265120	Let's talk about Gyllenhaal for a second.
2265120	2270120	In this movie, just because I want to protect him
2270120	2272120	because I feel like he's making choices in this movie
2272120	2274120	that are so fucking over the top that everyone,
2274120	2276120	that I'm afraid, maybe I'm wrong about this,
2276120	2278120	but I'm afraid people are going to go,
2278120	2280120	why is he acting like the Riddler
2280120	2283120	when other people aren't doing that?
2283120	2286120	But like, what kind of conversations
2286120	2289120	does Director Bong have with actors?
2289120	2290120	Do they show up to set and go like,
2290120	2292120	I thought I'd try something like this?
2292120	2293120	And he's like, whatever.
2294120	2297120	Or is he like, how hands on is he?
2297120	2299120	So, Jake came in like, I think we were halfway
2299120	2302120	through our shoot in Korea or so.
2302120	2307120	And we were literally on this mountainside at her house
2307120	2309120	when he comes up.
2309120	2312120	The mountain is like, that was like the first day.
2312120	2314120	And it's this beautiful set.
2314120	2315120	It's in the middle of nowhere.
2315120	2318120	You have to like hike down for like 10 minutes.
2318120	2320120	It's super secluded.
2320120	2323120	And Director Bong was just like, yeah,
2323120	2325120	so, you know, he's coming up the thing
2325120	2327120	and maybe he's just really out of breath.
2327120	2329120	So he's like, hey, hey.
2329120	2331120	And you know, so he kind of ran with it.
2331120	2333120	And then that happened.
2333120	2335120	And it kind of just stuck.
2335120	2338120	And we, you know, of course, like us being on the other end,
2338120	2342120	you know, we see those dailies and we're just like,
2342120	2345120	does anybody want to say anything?
2345120	2348120	And what does Bong say?
2348120	2350120	Well, we were like, hey, so, and he was like, no,
2350120	2351120	I kind of like it.
2351120	2352120	So then we're like, all right.
2352120	2355120	And we had like this weird trust that it would work out.
2355120	2356120	And it did.
2356120	2360120	But he stuck with being out of breath as a character choice.
2360120	2366120	So when you see the film, I think he is very high pitched.
2366120	2368120	It's kind of like, did you see Snowpiercer?
2368120	2369120	Did you?
2369120	2371120	I hated Snowpiercer.
2371120	2372120	There's like.
2372120	2373120	It's a bad movie.
2373120	2374120	Meet me after the show.
2374120	2377120	I'll explain it to you.
2377120	2381120	There's like everybody's.
2381120	2384120	Tilda Swinton, what she's doing in this movie,
2384120	2387120	along with Giancarlo Esposito, who was on Community.
2387120	2388120	That's not important.
2388120	2394120	But it was also kind of exciting.
2394120	2400120	Just the two of them, along with what Director Bong does with Foley,
2400120	2404120	like in scenes that have no score where they're talking.
2404120	2410120	And like Tilda Swinton is like doing just the character is like.
2410120	2415120	A total cartoon and absolutely like rich somehow,
2415120	2417120	like captivating.
2417120	2420120	Maybe that's just, oh, you're pulling out the Ferrari of actors
2420120	2422120	and you're just like, like, so just cruising around the block
2422120	2425120	feels like an Olympic sport.
2425120	2429120	Or maybe there's like, but it feels like this incredibly amazing character,
2429120	2430120	this performance.
2430120	2433120	And then Giancarlo being like her like attendee.
2433120	2435120	And then he like goes and makes a cup of coffee.
2435120	2439120	And you're just like the choice of the camera to be everywhere it is
2439120	2442120	at every moment where you watch Giancarlo Esposito
2442120	2446120	make a cup of coffee for a second before doing his next line of dialogue.
2446120	2448120	And everything is just Foley.
2448120	2453120	Step, step, step, click, pour, steams.
2453120	2455120	You're thinking you're bringing her to New York.
2455120	2456120	And then that's my favorite.
2456120	2457120	That's one of my favorite parts.
2457120	2460120	She goes, I was just about to say that.
2460120	2463120	And I think it's in that scene because like then Gyllenhaal's also in that scene.
2463120	2466120	He comes into it and goes like, here's what I think.
2466120	2471120	And I'm kind of like, oh, man, I don't want anybody to be punished for enthusiasm.
2471120	2478120	No, I think the way that I like reconciled that in my head was that his character,
2478120	2482120	basically he like 10 years ago was this normal guy.
2482120	2486120	And then for 10 years, he's been playing the role of this spokesperson
2486120	2490120	and having to do all this stuff, and he's become a puppet for this corporation,
2490120	2493120	that he's almost become the role that he was just playing.
2493120	2495120	And he does say that stuff.
2495120	2498120	Yeah, and then she even says, like, quit your whining.
2498120	2499120	Right.
2499120	2503120	If I was in the edit bay, no one needs my help on this movie.
2503120	2504120	It's a masterpiece.
2504120	2508120	But I was like, well, put your money where your mouth is, Harmon.
2508120	2512120	If I was in the edit bay and I had all that footage and I had one pickup shot,
2512120	2519120	I would just have one shot where Gyllenhaal's character does a little anal nitrate.
2519120	2523120	Like, he just does one popper.
2523120	2525120	Or something weird, some weird thing.
2525120	2527120	Like, huff something.
2527120	2532120	Well, you know, that would have been helpful like three months ago.
2532120	2533120	But it's not, yeah.
2533120	2534120	I mean, yeah.
2534120	2538120	So the movie, like, this is the thing.
2538120	2541120	It's okay to say he's not a vegetarian, right?
2541120	2542120	No.
2542120	2549120	He helped write, he conceived of this movie and then shot the entire thing.
2549120	2557120	Everyone that watches this movie for at least 48 hours is not, you know, you're going to just not have sausage.
2557120	2558120	Yeah.
2558120	2566120	I remember being in a meeting earlier on after we were doing some scouting and we were watching some research footage of,
2566120	2572120	there's a scene where they're, I don't want to, like, give it away, but they're dealing with animals in a certain way.
2572120	2581120	And so it's based, that scene is based off of a real, how they actually treat cattle.
2581120	2583120	Well, of course, yeah, we figured, yeah.
2583120	2588120	And I was sitting in this meeting and he was like, oh, I want to show you this research clip.
2588120	2590120	And we were like, I was like, oh, God.
2590120	2598120	And I was sitting there trying to hide that I was crying, like, in a room full of, like, producers and other execs.
2598120	2600120	Was it actual, like, actual footage of that?
2600120	2604120	Yeah, it was actual footage of cattle being led to their slaughter, essentially.
2604120	2609120	And they, like, were coiling kind of knowing, like, they were headed into something dangerous.
2609120	2611120	And it was, like, the worst thing I'd ever seen.
2611120	2613120	And I was like, I don't want to eat anything after this.
2613120	2621120	I had a couple of friends, and I can't say their names because they might still be, like, the ALF, the Animal Liberation Front, was on FBI's most wanted list.
2621120	2623120	And they might still be.
2623120	2631120	And they would go into meat processing plants and animal testing labs and take the footage.
2631120	2634120	And I would tell people, like, I'm vegetarian.
2634120	2635120	I don't preach it.
2635120	2636120	People should eat what they want to eat.
2636120	2637120	But there's a couple of things.
2637120	2640120	If you don't want to eat meat, don't watch this tape.
2640120	2644120	There's footage that's so absolutely compelling and so horrifying.
2644120	2653120	And that's the thing that I want to make clear only because, creatively, this movie deserves so much recognition for what it's somehow pulling off.
2653120	2655120	And I have no idea how it's doing it.
2655120	2662120	How is it that part of the movie, everything that I've said, you know, you're imagining, like, oh, I understand.
2662120	2666120	The idea is, like, like, Lisa Simpson, she sees the movie, and it's, like, gross.
2666120	2668120	And it's, like, you don't want to eat meat anymore.
2668120	2673120	It's, like, it's not somehow it doesn't gross you out.
2673120	2681120	It doesn't make you it doesn't spank you as a meat eater for 40 years.
2681120	2684120	But it just somehow invites you up.
2684120	2685120	I think that's the point.
2685120	2687120	We didn't want to.
2687120	2693120	For us, at least, our intention is to never be, like, preachy about anything.
2693120	2700120	We just want to show you a different view of something and be, like, kind of like, hey, this is how it is.
2700120	2701120	Make your own decisions.
2701120	2707120	But we would like to show you a different side of the truth that maybe you don't you aren't familiar with.
2707120	2711120	And that's kind of like it's a really extraordinary mind at work on his part.
2711120	2714120	It's like, would he be a better person if he didn't eat meat?
2714120	2715120	Sure. So would I.
2715120	2722120	But since he does enjoy bacon at breakfast, him making that decision, artistically, what I'm going to do is I'm going to.
2723120	2731120	Put my camera on this side of this of that story, that issue that that and I'm going to do that faithfully.
2731120	2734120	He just wanted to do that creatively and it no.
2734120	2737120	And then he just finished the movie and he ordered some sausage.
2737120	2743120	And that to me, it may not make any of us good people, but it certainly makes him a genius.
2743120	2749120	You know, actually, I think when he went on his research trips to he actually like visited some slaughterhouses.
2750120	2759120	I think he couldn't. I think the whole crew that went on that trip couldn't touch meat for a while because it was like there's something about the smell.
2759120	2766120	And there's also different levels of we're talking about, like, you know, I imagine there's people that have different levels of issue with different.
2766120	2778120	It's like there there's probably people in the audience that personally eat meat, but also recognize that there's perhaps like an industrial problem where we we were doing it wrong.
2778120	2781120	The system is built wrong. We're over addicted to me.
2781120	2794120	We we we should make it more expensive and it should be always processed in a in a way that comes as close as possible with a bow and arrow and praying over its carcass in the forest.
2794120	2796120	Yes, that's exactly what.
2798120	2802120	But what about you, by the way, I never asked you, like, are you a vegetarian?
2803120	2813120	I have made a kind of decision to try and do the pescatarian thing for a while, because after actually after having worked on this, I didn't eat pork for the entire thing.
2813120	2821120	I just there's something about piggies and what about crustaceans actually don't like shellfish or Christy.
2821120	2826120	That's not. Yeah, I'm off of them since New Orleans just ate too much.
2826120	2836120	I just brought a brown bowl of it looked like H.R. Giger, like made it was just like everything is just like the eyes of the face.
2836120	2838120	And it had an expression on its face.
2838120	2846120	I don't know. I wasn't a human. And it wasn't. I wasn't like, oh, this poor this poor this poor jumbo shrimp, like that's the exact face they make right before they die.
2846120	2852120	It just freezes when they know they're like, you know, I'm going to be served to the guy that's not even going to appreciate me.
2853120	2858120	What a terrible death. You killed me and the guy didn't fucking dig it. Yeah, didn't even.
2858120	2868120	But but it was more like because they put a bib on you and but it's like I look over at Cody and she's like, yeah, you know, I don't know.
2868120	2874120	But I'm like, what did you do? I lifted out of the bowl just and I just it's curled up.
2875120	2882120	And then you uncur as you uncurl it, the legs go like that and then juice goes everywhere.
2882120	2887120	And then you just like, well, do I eat the face off and then squeeze?
2887120	2893120	I think you're supposed to like rip the head off and then suck the head. Suck the head, she says.
2893120	2901120	Sorry. Yeah. But at the end of the day, I just peeled it like a hard boiled egg down to a big jumbo shrimp and then ate it.
2901120	2906120	It was like, yeah, it's fucking shrimp, bro. Don't make it shake like an insect.
2906120	2911120	But you were talking about you don't like when you get meat on the bone. You don't like to have to do the work.
2911120	2919120	Yeah, you want it to be done for you. And I would definitely if we were living in a proper kind of caveman tribe, you die.
2919120	2925120	I would. No, I would be a vegetarian. I would be like, OK, I'll you know, I wrote a play for you guys.
2925120	2934120	Can I have a piece of brisket? And and if the alpha was like, no, you got to you got to kill what you eat, what you kill, then I'll have a salad.
2934120	2943120	Like, I don't like your attitude and good, good luck with the obvious analogy for your character in my play.
2943120	2949120	What do you think would be what do you think would be in your in your caveman salad? What would that consist of?
2949120	2955120	Arugula and Parmesan. Just because I like that a little Dom.
2955120	2963120	That's one thing about the caveman that people don't really appreciate is how good they were at making aged cheese.
2963120	2968120	But Christina, like, how did you get that you your producer? You work for Plan B.
2968120	2974120	How long have you been there? A little over six years. I'm an executive producer, executive producer.
2974120	2979120	It's a step below. No, it's a step below. Yeah. Settle down. I fell for the same thing.
2979120	2983120	I'm an executive producer and a novel. Lisa, it's like, you know, I didn't do anything.
2983120	2989120	But you did lots of stuff on this movie. So when awards are handed out, you're not going to be up on the stage for that necessarily?
2989120	2996120	No, no, I'm OK with that. But what stage did you get involved in the film? How early?
2996120	3005120	So I got involved in the towards the end of twenty fifteen, I think October or November of twenty fifteen.
3005120	3014120	I was like shipped away on a scout location scout for like days. I forgot the connection was Plan B, which is Brad Pitt's company, which is hilarious.
3014120	3025120	He's the CEO of me like. Yeah. Is he is he always eating when he comes into meetings or is that only as an acting choice?
3025120	3036120	Like it's like, you know, he likes to eat because he started like as soon as it appears as soon as he got a say in what he gets to do on camera, he was obviously starting as an actor.
3036120	3042120	Could I be eating something? Watch any Brad Pitt movie with the sound off. He moves his head a lot and he points a lot.
3042120	3052120	A lot of pointing, a lot of.
3052120	3057120	George Clooney has like a weird like George Clooney's head always like I got a swivel. It's like he's bobbing.
3057120	3063120	Like it's funny to watch like actors without the sound on it. All right.
3064120	3073120	I know what I'm going to go. Give us some dirt and Brad Pitt. Talk some Brad Pitt shit. I really he's a lovely human being. It's just the best.
3073120	3082120	What is it? How often I mean, just like what is he like in person? I mean, I'm just honestly just asking like I'm a high schooler.
3082120	3092120	I don't I mean, it's I feel like I'm just going to let it. He's literally just like he's normal. He comes in and he doesn't go.
3093120	3097120	But it's cool. I mean, he's got his company is doing cool shit like World War Z.
3097120	3104120	You know what? I understand why it wasn't what it didn't break records and whatever.
3104120	3110120	But it was a great idea to try to make that book into a movie and geopolitical zombie.
3110120	3115120	Yeah. I like I like I like I like his usage of what he's been dealt.
3115120	3121120	Like he you know, he's Brad Pitt and like he's like lots and lots of actors are like, OK, then I'll have a production company.
3121120	3125120	And but he's like clearly some some somewhere in that pipeline.
3125120	3130120	There's somebody going and it might be CEO Brad Pitt going like I want to make good choices.
3130120	3139120	Yes, of course. He's he's great. But D.D. Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner, my colleagues are like really just crushing it.
3140120	3145120	I remember D.D. Gardner worked at Paramount right a long time ago before Plan B.
3145120	3150120	Is it OK? Brad Pitt. We got it. We got it. Yeah, that's great.
3152120	3157120	Twelve monkeys. What is Brad Pitt? Does Brad Pitt. That was my that's where I'm getting my impression.
3157120	3164120	Does he have like a like I wear two outfits. I wear either a suit or I wear like a V next like sweater and jeans.
3164120	3170120	Like does he have an outfit? Does he have like this rapid have a uniform that he wears or does he wear a different shit every day?
3170120	3181120	Like give me some quotidian Brad Pitt shit. You know, I am I'm like the most unfun person to ask questions to you.
3181120	3186120	So you don't want to be part of our regular weekly segment, the pit stop.
3187120	3191120	Well, we just check in. Check in. Well, five seconds.
3192120	3196120	But talk about OK. Welcome to the pit stop, everybody.
3208120	3214120	He doesn't have a uniform. It's the update. It's a whole different thing. Where were you born and raised?
3215120	3220120	Massachusetts. And so you moved you moved out to L.A. first or no.
3220120	3227120	You know, OK, so if you a brief I was born and raised in Massachusetts until I was 13 and they moved to Arizona.
3229120	3235120	Four people cheered for Massachusetts. One guy boo. I bet that guy's from Arizona, right?
3236120	3241120	Are you from Arizona? You're from Boston. You just don't like leaving Massachusetts. OK.
3242120	3248120	Where in Massachusetts? Boston. Boston. OK. I grew up in Peabody. Super, super tiny.
3249120	3253120	Is that a town that's spelled differently than its name would suggest?
3255120	3265120	I suppose. It's spelled P-E-E-B-U-D-D-Y. Yes. Peabody. That's the one. Peabody.
3266120	3272120	Gotta love Massachusetts. Yeah. And then I moved to L.A. Spencer. Will you be my team buddy later on?
3274120	3283120	Is production your ambition or are you transitioning? Is this is helping out in a production capacity?
3284120	3291120	Is it the end all be all or is it a means to know, of course, like I would be a producer without the executive in front of it.
3292120	3297120	But that's where it's not, you know, it's not like and then I'll be a director or then I'll leave that to people that are far more talented than I am.
3298120	3302120	I'm glad you said that because we have directors and writers appear all the time. Then we go, like, what's your advice?
3303120	3309120	But it's like we have so few, like Steve Levy, my assistant, he he wants to be a producer. And ten years ago I'd be like, turn away.
3310120	3316120	That's not an ambition. Fuck you. Suits are evil. Whatever. And I would have and then I would have gone on to get fired by everybody.
3316120	3323120	And no one likes me. And they're like, why do you keep calling us suits? I think people I think people don't really know what a producer does.
3324120	3332120	Producers are fucking important as A.F. to put it in your language. You're my language.
3334120	3342120	They are. They're important. A.F. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I switched over. I switched. It was like Gen X to millennial.
3342120	3353120	Like it's like Spanglish. I was like as A.F. All right. But now it's like saying like like like pin number. You can you can choose how much gender mustard you want to put on this.
3354120	3364120	You can either answer this for the young ladies in the audience as a woman interested in production or you can just answer it as a human being that also you can do both at the same time.
3364120	3389120	You guys are going to go home tonight and realize that meant nothing. I am not a villain. And that was not a hero. You'll figure it out later.
3390120	3406120	Whatever. I forgive you for you know not what you do. But yeah I mean if it's like like people out there that are going I want to work in production like what are they how and what are the obstacles any pieces of advice whatever take it.
3407120	3427120	Why thank you. There is no like do this and then do this and then do this and then you're a producer. If anyone ever tells you that they're lying to you. I did an internship worked my ass off and very serendipitously landed at this company.
3427120	3456120	People hear that maybe some people are going to go. How do you what do you open the yellow pages. Do you Google yellow pages and find out what yellow pages mean. Like what can you like really get granular about like what do you do from Massachusetts like what the first step where you go like I'm going to like start you have to have kind of slightly oppressive Asian parents that want you to be a doctor or a teacher.
3457120	3482120	And then but you secretly have to want to do something a little bit. I mean I. Oh happy Father's Day. Dad I love you. I love you so much. Actually my dad wanted to be a film director but then gave everything up and. Don't you have to call him father dad in your. Yes father. Father wanted to be a film director and he actually went to film school in Korea in I don't know 70s.
3482120	3510120	And then he immigrated to America to give us a better opportunity. So to speak. But then how do you get to be an intern on. Yeah. So then. So then I like moved Arizona went to school and Scott Stuber was an alumni at Stuber. I know. Do anything. He's like he just he's at Netflix now. He sounds like an Archie comic character. He's great. He's he's he's super lovely. And I interned at his company out of college in my last semester.
3510120	3538120	Is there a bulletin board. University of Phoenix is there. What was the University of Arizona. Yeah. Go Wildcats. No he was an alum there. So he had this like premier internship program that you had to apply for. And then I got it. And I went and you worked for free for four months. And then it opens doors for you I suppose.
3538120	3567120	But if anybody OK if anybody actually is interested or wants to know I guess come find me afterwards because I don't do that to yourself. OK then don't. But I feel like it'll be like. What do I do. What do I do. Can I be an intern on your show. Can I be a P.A. and all this stuff. And I'm like I don't. I'm not. I never did that. Yeah. And so I would say interning interning is a great thing. Be a P.A. but it's just like kind of like my thing is be nice to everyone and introduce yourself and like.
3567120	3596120	Be a cool person and things will happen if you're an asshole like I immediately I'm like I don't want to talk to this. How did you sustain yourself like when you were like people like that have internships like you're not being paid for your work. Like were you broke back then or did you have a. Yeah I lived. My parents helped me. Of course thank you. But I like lived with this old Korean couple. They were super nice. I like had a I stayed in a bedroom at their place that they like kind of randomly knew my parents.
3597120	3605120	And I just stayed in a lot and I didn't eat a lot of rice and Kim you're so racist right now.
3608120	3618120	That's the thing like like you hear about like like a lot of people that get to become like you know like you turn on the news and everyone's a journalist that they're all rich people because they could afford to be. Yeah.
3619120	3630120	I think they could afford to spend three years unpaid labor as interns and doing this stuff. But you like you actually just like lived you squatted with an old couple and didn't eat much except you know like basic food.
3631120	3646120	Well I did. I did. I mean like I did eat because otherwise I'd be a lot skinnier but no I do think like I I knew when I needed help and I was like listen like I want to do this like how do I do this in my school was really cool and helpful and I did.
3647120	3657120	I did thankfully find this couple which was kind of odd like it was in a weird bedroom in Korea town and there was a fridge in my room. I didn't really understand like a full size fridge.
3658120	3668120	Did you ever look inside of it. It was empty. Yeah. I lived in Korea town when I first moved to L.A. There was a murderer in the alley by my house.
3668120	3679120	And I wasn't that bad. But yeah we should talk later. It doesn't sound like I mean I guess it helped that I am Korean so it was it made a little bit of sense.
3680120	3692120	I'm sure the guy that got murdered was Korean. I don't know. I'm just assuming. But but but you know it is it is it is difficult. And I think like the difference now I think is a lot of internships actually do pay you.
3693120	3701120	Yeah. Yeah. That's good. What's next for producer. Oh what's next for plan B. If they're the same thing you can answer as a woman or a Korean.
3704120	3705120	But not both.
3706120	3721120	Actually I actually became a. Actually through this whole experience I became friends with Stephen Young. This is an awesome awesome dude. And so I think we are going to try and cook something up.
3721120	3733120	And then we're working on a film James Gray's next film right now. We just wrapped a film called Beautiful Boy directed by Felix von Groningen which is going to be a.
3736120	3743120	It's kind of it's going to be like a little sad but. Well it's 9 11 everybody. Let's hear it for Christina.
3745120	3746120	But those things aren't related.
3747120	3749120	Thank you Christina for talking about.
3763120	3772120	So right now you're saying Dean. There's been a shift in the show. You're wearing a foam super pig on your head. It seems like a harbinger of some sort of new aspect to our to our program.
3773120	3778120	And also you dismissed your guests like some kind of weird handmade patriarch.
3779120	3790120	You sent her off. Why would that be. Well because as promised like this is finally it after much fucking to do. We're going to we're going to play our new Pathfinder campaign.
3791120	3811120	I think you might have jumped the gun on the music. I just want to give it a sting. Oh OK. Because I think well let's let's let's let's see if this experiment can work or we take a break for the for the midroll ad that the people that pay five dollars a month don't have to listen to.
3812120	3819120	And instead the people listening to the ad on the free version of the podcast don't get to hear the following.
3827120	3837120	You know we don't actually have to do anything because no one will know. I think they'll know they'll get on Reddit and they're not going to say nothing. These guys are too cool to be on Reddit.
3842120	3848120	Let's just talk shit about Reddit during the night. Yeah they hate Reddit. Reddit is like the Arizona of sites.
3855120	3863120	Arizona. Wow. It's a great. It's a great Arizona is a great state to go to if you hate women Mexicans and gay people and front lawns.
3864120	3881120	But you love gravel. Their front lawns are gravel. Look your your statements bear no fucking gravitas right now. You got a phone. I know what I know what to do during our. This is still during our. This is still our special break. Let me show because this will just be for people that are.
3882120	3883120	We're going work factor seven.
3893120	3908120	The actor his eyes. Do you guys think LaVar Burton like to listen to that episode. Did something happen during that show that would explain LaVar Burton not only not showing up to my wedding but also just generally I don't know. I feel like
3911120	3930120	I think he's on ear wolf now. Maybe it's an ear wolf beef. Oh don't we have our brains on here. No. OK. I think he is. Can you pull up the. I got my iPhone plugged into the feed because I just wanted to show these. You might have seen these retweeted this picture. These are those meat torture videos.
3931120	3953120	This is the this is the photo of the protesters that were outside Shakespeare in the park. This guy's got a little sign that says boo the cast and this guy. And don't be don't be fooled in the thing. This is a crowd. It's just two pictures were just this guy is behind this lady in the first.
3954120	3970120	So it's just Spielberg here with his pro Trump far left. It's America. So the weird thing is I retweeted that and then somebody like that had tweeted they're like hey respect my investigative journalism because what I found out is that this person was saying this.
3970120	3996120	I followed this like kind of sub thread and they were like this guy was outside the fucking Hamilton show in New York. It's the same guy with the same sign. Same font. Do you think that he like Cody Cody said oh man if his son breaks his arm he can stand up at the hospital and get triple.
3996120	4015120	But I don't know why you wouldn't want to cheer that cast because it's an Obamacare cast or if he becomes a ghost. But this guy said now it's like a question of is he so he definitely went from a boring villain to an interesting villain.
4015120	4036120	But if he goes to it what can he do with the sign to make him the world's shittiest hero. But what's his angle. He hates the cast because they're being lefties or what. Well you know Shakespeare in the park thing you know they did Julius Caesar and they it's like look when you do Julius Caesar you you you pick a fucking wardrobe you pick an angle.
4036120	4049120	They go oh let's make up 1920s gangsters other thing and they did an Obama thing where they Julius Caesar was an African American man and they they and this this time they gave him a big long red tie in like blonde hair.
4049120	4066120	And so then it was like we all know that these people aren't actually offended and don't they're just playing this fucking weird game of hungry hungry hippos with us like where it's like they just like they're just like I don't know that was a game from 1849.
4066120	4078120	It's just so fucking weird but I don't want to get sidetracked by that because we are we all spend our days. Where was this taken. This is also in New York. No. Wait. Where's Shakespeare in the park. Where is that central park.
4078120	4089120	Yeah. Somebody here. This guy has that much free time when he just goes from theater to theater. I like the idea that he made the sign for Hamilton and then he brought it home and he's a hoarder and he just put it on the side of the he didn't.
4089120	4105120	He didn't. He's like he's like I don't know. I'm going to hang on to that because the the arts typically you know I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't the last time that a play gets intertwined with my politics and then he went to sleep and he ate some spam and he.
4105120	4113120	But if he likes the play he has another sign that says don't boo the cast boo the player.
4114120	4125120	All right. We're back from the secret segments. Oh Jesus. If you're working at Feral audio you shouldn't have left any of that in the show. No one's working there. Okay.
4125120	4135120	And he's leaving and she can't even walk. It's bad when any walks out. It's like yeah.
4135120	4140120	Please stay. We just got into our ableist jokes.
4140120	4151120	She's just going to the bar. There's 45 people online. That is where you will always find Annie. All right. So Spencer. Hey guys. Are you ready to rock and roll some D&D right now some path finder rather.
4151120	4164120	I got to say though I think it'll be bad. So I'll just put that out there. Why are dwell my my student. Yeah. It's a great way to make it good. Why are you so pessimistic. Are you just lowering expectations.
4164120	4177120	No. Well I mean technically yeah I am lowering your back. But I'll give you an honest leave. He's not here and we just last show we agreed. Oh it's going to work. You know we're going to make it consistent.
4177120	4191120	It's going to be the three characters. Now Levy is you know. Right. Visiting his family for Father's Day like he does every year because his dad died. What a fucking asshole.
4191120	4212120	Me me me more like Steve. Me me. Yeah. Steve me me more like Steve. Leave us. He did. He did. Yeah. But that could be your excuse because you could that caught you off guard. Now you got to confine the adventure to the two of us.
4212120	4240120	I'm just I'm excited about it. I'm barely drunk. Like I'm like not as drunk. Yeah me too. And and I just we're going to do real. I know my spells. I. Yeah. It'll be bad. It's fine. I know my character. Yeah. Like I know who I am kind of. You said earlier you might change your name from Carlos. Oh yeah. I thought about it for a second because I was like oh Carlos.
4240120	4269120	People are going to. Oh that's like a freaks and geeks reference. Like wasn't that James Franco's character. Was it Carlos the dwarf. But then I thought well he's Carlos the unimaginative. So I don't know. I say leave it. I say leave it because if it's all of a sudden I'm named Duracell the fuck like you know like. Wait Duracell the fuck like Duracell the fuck bucket. Oh fuck bucket. I heard fuck like. I want. Look if you don't become Duracell the fuck bucket. I hope we meet that character somewhere along the road.
4270120	4272120	Duracell the fuck.
4275120	4277120	That just made me happy.
4278120	4292120	I also feel like once you once you once you riff the name Carlos if you change it to anything else I do feel like the Latino community feels we're going to have a very valid complaint because I'm like famous for the lack of fucking Latino presence in my.
4293120	4306120	Yeah. And remember that that what's going to have the soccer joke. Remember the Latino community joke. Oh man. You are not coming back after that. You are way behind with that population.
4307120	4314120	I don't take another risk by changing a name away from Carlos or you'll be just out of the game.
4315120	4329120	All right. Well I'll stay out. There's that the thing it is like there is a press conference at community college and then there's like Mr. Estudiante press. How would this affect soccer. Oh that. Yeah. Well you think people were so.
4330120	4336120	There's protests. All right. OK. All right. So Spencer how do you how do you want to kick this out. It was a great joke.
4337120	4354120	Great. Do you. You let me know when you want theme music you can you can cast us off into a mystical realm of madness and man. All right. We're going to do real combat turn based. No more. I build a boat and row it to the weapons store.
4355120	4367120	And you can say that but he's like oh you say OK you start building a boat. Spencer you're going to keep us honest on our on our if we do things that are not proper you're going to you're going to give us notes. Right. Yeah.
4368120	4378120	As far as I feel like doing that right. Especially your enthusiasm your enthusiasm is exhilarating. Yeah I'm really just trying to set the table.
4379120	4392120	Should we start. Yeah yeah. Are you ready. All right. The town of Rowan has been in peril a letter from the local priory details of village under siege by evil.
4393120	4419120	The prior says heresy and evil have taken root in the town and demons and evil spirits have been inflicting the towns folk. They've begged for aid in the past and they've lost contact with both of the clergymen who are sent to investigate the prior fears for the lives of his congregation and seeks the aid of the church militants and rooting out the source of the evil and saving the village from its sin.
4420120	4437120	All right. I didn't get a lot of that because I couldn't I realized oh shit there's going to be notes. It's a classic trend of yours. It's good. So let's start by asking questions. Do you have any questions maybe generating from the fact that you didn't hear some of this.
4438120	4461120	I got a I got a letter. Yes from my superior or some you know some bureaucrat within my church said go to this town. Right. This town is languishing from evil. Right. There's evil taken root in this town and its effect in our towns folk. What's the town's name. Rowan or Roan.
4461120	4472120	I think that's just Roan right. Sure. I mean I invented the I mean that's a word. Yeah. Let's move past. I wrote it down with a W. So let's just call it Rowan. I mean whatever.
4473120	4480120	I actually. No I don't think you writing it down wrong should change the name. Yeah you can't do that. I don't think.
4481120	4505120	You are you are waffling on your own decision. Will the pronunciation to be sure. Yes that doesn't open you up. This is what I'm talking about when I said that. Dungeon topping from the bottom of the dungeon. No it's great. Everyone's great. All right. So you guys you're in like a horse drawn wagon together because you've been you're you've been dispatched on this mission. Yeah.
4506120	4532120	Hey Carlos Chad. Good to see you back. You were away for a while. It's nice to be back on a case with you. Yeah. I'm really proud of you. Really. I remember I taught you things as my in my role as a cleric at the church of the silver flame flame. Sure.
4533120	4553120	And you were a great acolyte. You were a great initiate. Yeah you know but I'm I'm I'm I think I'm pretty grown up now. I feel weird that we're equals like we're basically the same kind of status like in the church. I think of you as kind of a hero. You were my mentor but now we're working side by side as a team.
4554120	4580120	All right. Don't don't. I mean it's good to just say that stuff. Don't don't carry shame around with you. You know just keep yourself pure. I admit to my jealousy like I teach young kids how to be adept at the arts of the silver flame and I you know when I see them rise in stature faster than I've ever been able to.
4581120	4605120	I get I get jealous. You kind of get in your own way a lot like you know you could have been top dog. You just you you you kind of self-sabotage yourself a lot. Yeah I mean and now you're being a dick and I think but if I know the key is which of us is more self inspecting and which of us is saying stuff like that.
4605120	4634120	And the answer that person. Let's look. Let's let's let's let's just drop it. I clearly clearly is a lot of baggage there. I know this church is fucked up. You know what it's fucked up church is the reason why we're here. We're trying to purify ourselves and purify the world of evil. The religion is the reason we're here. The church is fucked from the head down by people that believe more in politics than religion. Okay. Well I think that's a good question.
4635120	4664120	Well let's not talk. Can we have one wagon ride where we're not doing this. I'm just concerned for the people of Rome. It's pronounced Rowan but that's cool. How far out do you think we are. Driver. You're the driver. Hello. What. Oh I'm driving. Yeah. It's just like a horse. Jesus.
4665120	4690120	Carlos. Are you drunk. I have a voice in my head. I thought maybe was the silver flame said you're the driver and I thought it meant I if you've been drinking you just you're supposed to put the reins to the wagon in the bowl by the door like somebody else drives the wagon. It's okay. It looks like Rowan's. I look ahead on the road. What do I see. All right.
4690120	4713120	The road is rough and bumpy out in the countryside and the rolling hills look endless and foreboding in the dreary gray of the darkening clouded sky following an even smaller winding road to your left takes you off off the main path and into the vert and into the gentler yellow planes that give way to fenced plots of fallowed farmlands.
4713120	4742120	That's like farmlands without crops in them. The edge of town. This must be the edge of town aside from a single small house and barn near one of these farm plots and two darkened ruined kind of burnt looking structures. No real buildings or civilization are found this far out. It seems like way down the way there's there's a bit more of a town but you really only see in these kind of three buildings on this on this path and it's kind of getting towards evening.
4742120	4764120	Maybe we should stop here and flip the horses rest and maybe give them some something to eat some water. Let's see if there's any people around that can give us information. The kind we won't get once we're in the confines of the city. The three buildings are a barn a farmhouse. What else will you see a farm in a barn house or barn in a farmhouse. There we go.
4764120	4782120	That are right next to each other and then across like you're on a road and then that's on say the left side of the road and then on the right side of the road you just see two kind of burnt out husks of buildings. Whoa. Easy.
4783120	4804120	We leave the wagon into the barn. OK. So all right. Yeah. No you go you roll up towards the barn and you can see there's light coming from inside the farmhouse and the barns closed for the night. Oh it's nighttime already at sundown. Well it's it's like getting dark but the barns magic hour.
4805120	4832120	That if that's established then sure. It might be magic. I kind of quietly walk up and to a window at the farmhouse. OK. Wait. Sorry. So we should establish what you guys look like. I mean we can establish that later. But I don't know. I'm a gnome druid. Yeah. I'm a short little fellow. I carry a walking magical quarterstaff.
4833120	4848120	That has secret powers and my name is Chad the firelacker. I'm a gnome druid. Right. And I you know I'm dressed druidic. I've kind of brightly colored hair and a brightly colored outfit. I'm a little eccentric. Your colorful gnome man. Sure.
4849120	4873120	I'm a human size medium. I am. I'm wearing a dirty robe. Right. So that's like church clothes kind of. But your clothes are probably not like church clothes. They're like colorful. I mean I I I accent my church garb with you know like I got like a. Oh OK.
4873120	4899120	I got like my pouch. I carry my stuff and it's kind of like a fanny pack. It's very brightly colored. I think I kind of look like an older Antonio Banderas. Great. This is perfect. Maybe with a little paunch. Like I'm not athletic. But that might be part of. I don't know what Antonio Banderas looks like these days. But I think I think I kind of look like a like a like a more ragged Seth Green.
4903120	4932120	Well this will be perfect. Thank you. Sorry for the diversion. So we are parking our carriage. This is one that we owned. Did we rent this. It's it's I mean it's the church's maybe. But yeah it's like a company car. It's a church wagon. It's a church wagon. So we park it. You know what. I'm assuming my character knows more than I do about how to park a horse drawn cart. You kind of just stop it really.
4933120	4961120	And how far is this light from this farmhouse. The farmhouse is like maybe there's a six like a five foot gap between the farmhouse or the farmhouse in the barn. So it's really close. They're right next to each other. So that the glow is really close from the window and you said you're going to the window right. Yes. OK. So you look in the window and you see you see a woman who's tending to tend it to a cauldron over a fire. But it looks like a cooking cauldron not like a witch cauldron.
4964120	4988120	Yeah. Well you're a goblin. You shouldn't be hanging out. Dude dude I'm a gnome. So it's fucking this. I'm going to the front door. A goblin. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't. I'm sorry. I actually misheard that. I wouldn't say that. My character wouldn't say that. You know what. Because I actually. If I if I didn't have.
4989120	5002120	I didn't have so much respect for you. I would tell you that I see why the church doesn't keep you in their good graces while you're at the same level. Like you should be like like 10 times higher ranking than you are. We're the same. I'm like the third your age.
5005120	5010120	You can't you walk around calling people goblins. It's like it's fucking fuck. Fuck you.
5011120	5021120	So why don't we just finish this. Let's read Rowan of Evil and get the fuck out of here and then you can go hang out with other racist people.
5023120	5036120	I go to the front door. I don't need you to be a perfect person.
5037120	5042120	I look at you as an opportunity to learn.
5045120	5050120	I channel the silver flame and purifies the earth of evil. Knock knock knock.
5057120	5065120	You hear that coming from inside someone. I only speak common. Yeah. So is that really what they're saying. Yeah. It's like an old person.
5066120	5083120	I'm sorry. He's just grumbling. He's grumbling. He's coming to you. You hear a guy come into the door and then from the other side of the door you say who's who's out there.
5084120	5104120	Inquisitors from the Church of the Silver Flames sir. You hear him lock in or not lock in unlock in multiple locks and he swings open the door. He's holding he's holding like a kitchen knife but he's not like menacing. It's just kind of like he was holding a kitchen knife before this.
5105120	5130120	Put put the knife down Siri might if we come inside. Sure. Yeah. Well who are you. We're from the Church of the Silver Flame. We hear that your town and ravaged by evil. You said that. Who are you. My name is Chad. Okay. The Fire Liker. My name is Carlos the knife suspector. My name is Tom the farmer.
5131120	5151120	He puts down the knife. Thanks. He he kind of turns away from you and just motions you to follow him in. He's gone. More church. God damn it. More church half this damn chat town is church whole place is fucking church ain't done any good. My name's Tom Tom.
5152120	5175120	I walk in do that thing where I just kind of drag my finger around along the surface and like check and see how dusty it is. It doesn't mean anything but it looks like I know what I'm doing. Oh yeah. It looks like you know you're doing the church folk that you're used to dealing with maybe from the ministry. We're militants. We get the job done or your lack of money back.
5176120	5197120	Sir Tom I'm sorry to come at you at this late hour but did you or anyone you know come in contact with the evil that just went through the town. He he wait. Do a sense motive check. It'll be great. Do you have a sense motive score on your skills. I do. All right. You can do one too. Okay.
5198120	5210120	And mine should be high because I have a wisdom of 16. I think both of you guys have reasonable wisdom. But yeah no I don't have any like extra score on some motive. All right. Well what's your wisdom then. And what's your sense.
5211120	5224120	My sense motive is checked but blank but my wisdom is 16 and my ability modifier is therefore plus three. My wisdom is 16 plus three. What are the odds. Both of you have the same score.
5224120	5241120	Okay. It's great. You he hears your question. What was the question. Did you or anyone that you know come in contact with the evil that ravaged your town. I don't know what you're talking about man. There's the only evil here is just church corruption.
5242120	5253120	But Dan you can tell he's he's he's hiding something. You have any family sir. Yeah yeah I got family.
5254120	5272120	Where are they. They're here. My wife Bonnie. Bring her out. She's in this area is like it's like an entry area that's attached to a kitchen area. So she's visible in this room. Yeah. Let me describe it's just like a house. There's a staircase that goes up into presumably like maybe bedrooms or stuff.
5273120	5287120	The main area is just kind of a one room. It's like a family room dining room kitchen. Sir I've been in houses. Yeah. I've lived in cooler places. No I'm kidding. That guy was saying that my house is.
5287120	5308120	Bonnie. Yeah. Yeah. Hey I'm inquisitor Carlos the unimaginative. Hence the name Chad the firelacker. Great. Don't mind me. I'll be just cooking. I'll have something out in just a sec. You probably need food.
5308120	5326120	Hey listen Bonnie I couldn't help but notice across the way there's a couple burned out buildings over there. Do you want to tell me what you saw. What went down over there. That was that was just James. James and his wife they moved out like burn their whole place down and just moved out one day and never spoke to nobody.
5326120	5337120	Can he sense motive on her. Yeah. She's she seems to be telling the truth. James is just your neighbor. Well yeah they were. Yeah.
5338120	5365120	How big is your family. Well three including you two. Yeah. Who's missing here. What's his name. Cliff. He's sick. Well is he sick with various disorders that come from being raised by people that forget your name. I'm kidding. Sorry.
5365120	5393120	It's okay. He called me a goblin earlier. It's all right. Can I see Cliff. Why. I'd like to take Cliff notes. That's been our show. Thanks for coming everybody. Is that a reference to something. It will be. I'd like to see Cliff. You see we just come into town. This is what we do. It's part of procedure.
5393120	5422120	You guys. You guys seem angry about the church. But we're here to help. If your church if your town has been under attack by evil. We're here to help. You've had complaints about the church. I'm assuming those complaints aren't that they were thorough attentive empathic. Concerned. Concerned. No. Not concerned. So I'm here to change that type. I don't like my colleagues. I'd like to talk to Cliff. Are you guys healers. You guys healers. I'm a healer. Really. Yeah.
5423120	5452120	I pull. I pull Carlos aside and go hey why don't we get these guys good graces and go up there and heal their sick child. Maybe I will. I have to see him first. Well he's sick. He shouldn't be seeing anybody except a cleric you dingbat. I mean it's your funeral. Threatening me. It's just a figure of speech. Oh well can you tell me. I mean you just said what does he have playing. No no. We don't really know what he's saying.
5452120	5481120	We don't really know what he's got. We just start walking up the stairs or wherever Cliff is. We just go to find him. We just push past the parents towards wherever Cliff is. Wait wait wait. But you successfully pushed past him. As I pushed past I also run my finger along another surface. Do the dust check. It tells you different information the last time.
5481120	5496120	You hear a crashing and banging coming from up the stairs as well as a yelling and Tom starts cursing. God damn it. God damn it. Not now. God damn it. Come on man. Cliff. Come on man. God damn it. I said.
5496120	5514120	Did you keep an eye on Bonnie and what's his name. Tom Tom Tom. Tom fell. And let me let me check out Cliff. I just don't want them coming up. I got eyeballs on the on the on the Tom cats and you go check the Eagles nest. Scenario three.
5514120	5540120	I go to I go to the door from which the sound is coming. All right. You do that. At the top of the stairs you see a shifting blue light flashing wildly under a crack in a bedroom door. You feel a sense of dread creep through your entire body as you hear an unearthly voice bellowing. Get out of my home. Get out of it. Cliff. No.
5540120	5569120	Well not your home then. Checkmate. He doesn't respond so maybe. I am here bearing the power of the silver flame. I am a purifying vessel. I sense that you are evil. You have five seconds to vacate this premises and this domain.
5570120	5600120	Yeah. Time's up. Bitch. Now I'm going to. Yeah. I'm just going to I'm just going to open the door. I'm not going to do anything fancy. I'm just going to open the door. You see a large bed shaking and bouncing around and there's a kid belted down to the bed and there's a strange light. There's a strange light kind of flashing around the room and you see darkness
5600120	5619120	kind of emanating and leaking from the kids eyes and his mouth is like you have no power over me. Oh I do. I do. I hear that and I come and join them in the room together and I say Carlos you know what to do. Channel energy.
5619120	5648120	I send out a burst of healing light to heal the living. No to damage actually to damage the undead. Yeah. OK. You do that. You see the wave wash over him and he goes. But he doesn't seem damaged or hurt in any way.
5648120	5677120	As if he's not a member of the undead. And that's called elimination. I'm always one step ahead. He's not undead. I'd call this a case of possession and that really gets my giblets. Finish your statement. Holy water. Do you have holy water.
5677120	5705120	Yeah I do. Oh all right. We'll cross it out then. Wait. You're taking it away. Oh no. OK. I'm using it. OK. Yeah. Holy water. Yeah. Can I get a pencil later. Yeah. I'll get you one later. Or maybe someone else can get you one later. OK. For now just remember if I try to use holy water later that I don't have it. I'll get. Yeah. It'll be great. OK. Oh no. You miss. You miss the bedridden child.
5708120	5735120	Holy water splatters to the floor in a broken file. I got it. I got it. I'm just going to try to like mop some of it up on my hands. All right. Well it's not your turn now. Right. OK. Yeah. Turns. Sorry. Initiative. It's Jeff. Well I don't have any skills to it like to get rid of evil necessarily. I call on the.
5735120	5755120	I summon the the advice of the the keeper of the flame. You you you meditate on the voice of the silver flame and it doesn't tell you any any specific things but you recall your training which is like to kill evil. OK.
5756120	5779120	I have some I have some cloth with me. This is this love a turn. I kind of wasted that one. Well what do you do. Well I take my cloth and I go over to where the holy water missed and I try to mop up the holy water and absorb the mist holy water and then try to use the absorbed holy water on Cliff. All right. Yeah. OK.
5780120	5803120	Don't coddle me if that's stupid. No I mean it is stupid but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. It could work very well. All right. Well you do that. You start mopping his brow with with a mop. No not a mop a handkerchief made of holy water inundated with holy water. Yeah. It deals two damage.
5803120	5822120	And as that happens you can see you can see the kitty raises his his arm and a tendril of shadow lashes out of his armpit at you dealing for damage. Jesus Christ. So he goes. We got armpit boogins. Yeah. All right.
5822120	5847120	All right. Shit got real. Is it my turn. No it's the ghost's turn. He doesn't do anything though. He's just laughing. Is it my turn now. Well you hear you hear people coming up the stairs and it's it's Tom and Bonnie. They're like what's going on. What are you doing. I heard some stuff breaking. We're doing more than you did. Close the door.
5848120	5869120	All right. Bad parents may close the door. All right. I didn't I didn't waste a turn doing that. No no. Because I want I want to cast that thing where I win. No I it's the it's the it's the I think it's solar flare. No it's.
5870120	5890120	No that's just a blinding thing. It's the thing that kind of just like I'm looking for it now and I don't see it. It's the it's a spell where I shitballs. I'm sorry. I thought it was like a thing where I create like an aura of deflection. Is that what it is. Well what are you trying to do.
5890120	5913120	What are you trying to do kind of deflect things with an aura. No I I'm looking for it now. I don't see it now. Yeah. Well what are you looking for. Oh I wanted to make like a bubble. You know I just like oh shit's going down. So I just want to buff us. You know like if it's like a video game I'm just like I'm just looking to buff. Yeah I think that's the order of deflection. Yeah. Yeah.
5913120	5942120	Okay. So I'm like. Silver flame. And I make like I just it makes you better at what you do. Makes us all better at what we do. Thanks man. All right. Great. Now it's just shit. I don't know how to attack.
5942120	5970120	I like a ghost inside a kid's body. I. Shit. I I cast flair and try to dazzle the ghost while like the by time for Carlos to finish the job. Oh man. You see the ghost. No not that ghost. There's no ghost. You see the kid get dazzled.
5970120	5991120	He's like like that. Carlos I got him dazzled. Go in for the fucking kill. It's his turn though. Oh shit. He goes. He starts thrashing about and you can see kind of these shadow tendrils lashing out some more. What's your what are each of your armor class.
5992120	6002120	Seventeen. All right. Well you pass. All right. The shadows lash at your body but they hit your armor and it's it feels good against your armor.
6005120	6015120	Leave this child or we will kill him. There's there's pounding on the door. What do you think you're doing. You know what you're doing because we could have just killed him.
6016120	6036120	We thought you'd like do something. I don't pound. I say I love the damn church. Oh yeah. Well we'll show you the power of the church. I dare. I tell the ghost of the ghost inside Cliff. Come out and fight like a ghost and not be a shit.
6036120	6059120	Well it's Dan's turn but you do say that. I check for more dust. I didn't hear that. We're really out of our league here like we know. What. That would be nice if they had that.
6059120	6086120	That would be nice if we abolished that. You know I mean I want it. It's hard to hit a kid like with a weapon. You really went in guns a blazing. I know we did. We did. We're bad. We're level two. I just I just punch the kid in the face.
6086120	6105120	It's a non lethal attack. I'm not using a weapon. I'm just like I just want to make it clear that we don't care. Like you can't use a human shield. We don't negotiate with ghosts. All right. All right.
6105120	6128120	Well so you you you you raise your fist and stomp over to the little boy and out out in front of the little boy a ghost kind of bursts out of his body and kind of stands like like guarding the little boy. But you know he's a ghost so you just walk through him and you deck the little.
6128120	6148120	Oh unless you want to stop. Does the ghost make you change your. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Sorry. Well then what do you want to do in response to the girls. Because that would be funny though. Well I mean if I if I see the ghost can I do more than stop. I mean I you know I.
6148120	6164120	Well whatever happened a good old turning of the undead you know I'm a cleric like that's that's a. Next level. He's a. Yeah. And I. Well a ghost is traditionally undead. Oh well but but if when he's in the dude he wasn't like. I mean.
6164120	6174120	I said you may be making assumptions that aren't based in reality. That's a catch all right.
6174120	6186120	I can't answer that question without giving you a hint. Carlos he just walked through a ghost before you hit that child. Well he didn't hit. Yeah you almost hit a child but thank God that ghost came out.
6186120	6196120	All right. Well I don't want to do too much metagaming but I think it might be an illusion. Maybe like like this isn't I don't think everything is what it seems.
6196120	6216120	I I I'm going to punch the kid anyway. So you step through the ghost and you deck the kid the ghost or the kid is still laughing like. And you deck the kid and a and a and a you hit him pretty hard.
6216120	6237120	He. I'm not proud of it. Right. Well you can be. He takes four damage and you can see his face start to swell and he goes. And the ghost the ghost that came out starts like grabbing on you and you can feel its coldness but it can't hurt you for whatever reason.
6238120	6262120	The ghost might be good. The ghost might be good. I got to yell something out at you. I go over and I hit the kid to the ghost. The ghost is protecting the kid. The ghost is protecting the kid. The kids possessed by a demon. Right. The ghost is undead.
6262120	6291120	And it's but it is out in front of the kid and not the kid is like still has a demon in him or something. Right. So I think it seems like we're making progress by hitting this kid. You're always making some sort of progress. I wait for my turn. OK. Well that will be after I I I I pass. I go to the kid I raise my fist like I'm going to hit him.
6291120	6313120	All right. So then the ghost boy jumps off at Dan and starts grappling onto you. But again I can't really do much. You can just feel like cold ghost fingers touching you and it's real creepy. And then the demon boy is like. And he starts vomiting all over the place. So you guys got to make reflex saves. What are your reflex saves.
6314120	6334120	Two two plus two two two plus two or two. Well two ability modifier two. That's four baby four. Cool. OK. So both of you. I keep not hitting you guys. You both dodge. But the ground is all slippery and slick with vomit. It's gross.
6335120	6355120	Then just then the mom and the dad burst in through the door and the dad's got a knife in the the mom has a flower pot. That's sexist but whatever. It's a classic female weapon. No she has a rolling pin shaped like a vagina.
6356120	6379120	And they're like leave our kids alone. You guys are the worst. Kids. Yeah. Kids. Is one of them a ghost. Yeah. One of them died about two months ago. We're still kind of dealing with it. What's his name. What's his name.
6379120	6407120	Archer. Archer if you want to protect Cliff you must work with us. Not again. Oh you can't punch a kid to death and kill the demon inside. Wait. I can't talk. I didn't say that. The ghost doesn't talk. I said that. Me the DM. Archer.
6407120	6431120	Archer. Help us. It looks at you with weird glowing eyes and then it dies back into the to the boy and the boy starts thrashing around some more and laughing. Get out of my house. I'm going in. You're going into a little boy.
6437120	6461120	All right. Full disclosure. I say to the parents like we're not really we know where this is our first time fighting a ghost demon. And yeah I asked Tom and Bonnie is it is the ghost is possessing your child the dead other child.
6461120	6489120	I don't know man. This is confusing. We're just trying to follow the facts. That ghost looked like you know the dead kid. Archer sidebar. Yeah. You know the only thing we haven't tried getting out of the house. I mean it's like we were we're assuming we're so we thought you were going to heal him. We didn't want you to kill him. Sorry you're side barring. I'll heal the damage I caused by punching his face.
6489120	6518120	But then I think our work is done here. Thorough. Channel energy. He gets healed. You like that. Yeah it's funny to me. What else do you like. Evil. You want some real cold soup. You want some gross soup. Does that taste good to you. Are you like the Adams family.
6518120	6547120	Where everything bad is good. Yeah I'm like the Adams family. Bonnie go make a bowl of horrible tasting soup. What the hell. What are you guys doing. I have a plan. Don't question the church. I don't know. I don't know what we're going to get out of it just healing the kids. We could just leave. We have to just leave. We have to leave.
6547120	6573120	We don't. We don't. We don't know what we're doing. OK. I turn to them and I do another desk check on the thing and I go look we're going to be back. We have we have a couple other leads to check out and we'll make sure that we help your kid and we're going to redeem the church in your eyes or our name isn't Chad and Carlos.
6574120	6597120	In the meantime ask yourself how is this your fault. My pot is boiling over. Dinner is ruined. In addition to this terrible evening. Good. The demon will like that. And then his mind will be blown that you're on his side. He might leave. He might be defined by opposition. A lot of demons like to fight.
6597120	6605120	If you just give them bad soup which they think is good soup they get confused and bored and they leave. Try that. We'll be back.
6605120	6634120	We walked down the hallway and I go Carlos like like you're supposed to be the healer guy. I'm a fire. You healed him. I can't just burn everything like you're supposed to like you threw. We tried the holy water thing. We got the ghost out. But what the fuck. We didn't get the ghost out. The ghost came out. It doesn't look. I don't know. I've never fought that kind of thing before. I know. I only can do so much. I can heal. I can cause wounds.
6635120	6653120	I can heal the wounds I cause. Why don't we why don't we take it down the street and let's gather some information. Let's let's grow as a team. We might learn something. Yeah. I mean that kid's been possessed for what. Months. He seems fine. He'll keep.
6654120	6673120	A week. A week. Yeah. What's another 10 minutes a day going to do. It seems like also a lot of laughing. It seems like it's pretty fun. Seems like everyone's a winner. I didn't get a letter saying go to a farmhouse and help Bonnie. You know their kid. You know we should do. We've been to town. These people probably aren't even.
6673120	6697120	Why don't we why don't we go across the street and check out these burned out the houses that the guy the neighbor James. And yeah we're going to go check out the area. We walk over toward the James burned out buildings. Should we should we call it. Was that a good stopping point. No we didn't do shit. Well it's 10. I mean we've been at this for an hour. Right. I mean we've been doing this.
6698120	6711120	Like a half hour. We keep going. I'm sorry. I just thought it was 10. It's 10 o'clock. We just wouldn't be ending on any applause. You guys are dooming me to have to do some kind of rapper. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I would love you to crack. Yeah.
6714120	6726120	All right. Put put that phone pick back in your head and let's do some rapping. We didn't do anything. We went into a room. There was a kid. That's important. That's like the cold open of our movie.
6726120	6737120	Like it's like we're bad at what we're doing like. And that makes the audience resonate with us. They're like yeah I don't know what I would have done either. Like that guy's like protection from evil. Fuck you. You don't know what you're talking about.
6737120	6762120	Like and not that we're saying if you I'm just saying like I got a bunch of spells that are like yeah I tried out of our league. Yeah I took out some spells that relate to evil because they're overpowered. OK. Like detect evil would be kind of an anti climax. Yeah I wouldn't use that right away. All right Zack you got a beat back there.
6768120	6769120	Yeah. Yo.
