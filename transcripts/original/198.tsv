0	25000	Hello, ladies and gentlemen of Hormetown! How are you doing?
25000	34000	I'm Favorite Esposito, I'm your comptroller, assistant, stepping up to official comptroller for tonight only.
34000	36000	Thank you so much for having me.
36000	47000	We have a great lineup of your favorites. You know them from this show, which they created, including Spencer!
47000	61000	I asked him what his title is. He said no title. He also asked that I specifically did not use his last name.
61000	63000	Because he's this show's Madonna.
63000	65000	Madonna, yeah.
65000	67000	You look good, girl.
67000	68000	Thank you. You too.
68000	76000	And now, please rise. No, you can stay seated. For your mayor, Mr. Dan Harmon.
76000	84000	Thank you.
84000	92000	Cameron Esposito.
92000	95000	Yup.
95000	99000	I'm in a good mood. I poked your belly backstage.
99000	100000	Oh, yeah.
100000	102000	I gave you a little Pillsbury poke.
102000	104000	Have I ever done that before?
104000	112000	Oh, yeah, all the time. And the weird thing is you always ask me if you've done it before.
112000	114000	No, no, it's never happened before.
114000	117000	A magical moment spirals into realization about nationalism.
117000	118000	What did you like about it?
118000	122000	No, we've never done it before. It was a spontaneous, magical moment we shared.
122000	124000	This is the kind of thing normal people do.
124000	133000	And my relationship with you is based on something stronger than normality, which is our undiagnosed spectral disorders, like whatever they may be.
133000	143000	Like, we have an axis of friendship that is based on pragmatism and things you can measure.
143000	149000	But it's also sometimes it gets lonely. Sometimes you look around and you wonder, should you?
149000	152000	Well, what am I just going to die? Am I going to turn into a skeleton?
152000	158000	And then there's going to be, you know, we talked on Mother's Day about the family and what are our obligations to family.
158000	164000	And boy, I love getting those tweets when you guys want to flaunt your normality.
164000	170000	It's always good. Just fire off a tweet to a stranger if you listen to their podcast and just tell them how their family works.
170000	176000	That's not a stupid thing to do. That's not going to trigger anyone.
176000	182000	Your family's probably identical to anyone in the world, right?
182000	186000	Especially if you heard them on a podcast. That seals the deal.
186000	189000	My family is identical. Hey, Dan, can I just ask you a point of order?
189000	192000	Spencer, belly poke, over shirt or undershirt?
192000	197000	Oh, I mean, yeah. I pulled my shirt up.
197000	205000	Yeah. Oh, yeah. I wanted to ask. I mean, because honestly, I feel like as a woman in Hollywood, it's really important to be treated the same way as anybody else.
205000	208000	And so just if you wouldn't mind.
208000	213000	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
213000	218000	Equality.
218000	221000	But we're not all created equal. That's like that.
221000	224000	You know, it's a thing. It's a belly thing.
224000	231000	My finger is bruised on what I assume is a washboard.
231000	234000	Oh, yeah. It's a real washboard under there.
234000	239000	That's not a flat lesbian superhero like trampoline.
239000	242000	Is that what it looks like on the outside of my clothes when you look at me?
242000	248000	I felt like I was like, oh, yeah, you're like a Barbie doll.
248000	253000	It's just like it's like solid plastic, but not in an artificial sense that you're a woman of substance.
253000	259000	But your body is obviously lies and she's gay.
259000	262000	And I'm not married. I'm not married.
262000	268000	This is making me feel so good. Like, please don't feel like you have to stop.
268000	273000	If I felt great about my body, it wouldn't be a standup comic.
273000	277000	It's obnoxious. What I everything I do. OK.
277000	279000	Well, I just thought it was super normal.
279000	281000	Like I didn't even think, oh, this is a weird thing.
281000	286000	So maybe we're like becoming even more normal through each other.
286000	290000	Yeah. Like we're leveling up.
290000	293000	That'd be nice.
293000	298000	I think like, OK, I'm just looking for I don't know what to talk about first.
298000	302000	Just give me a second. Don't act like you're not entitled to anything.
302000	305000	Yes, you are. Ten dollars worth of so sorry.
305000	307000	I didn't mean to lash out at you.
307000	311000	You also drove through heavy traffic. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.
311000	315000	I'm going to do better than that. I acknowledge my crime.
315000	318000	I express remorse and I'll do something to change it.
318000	323000	OK, that that was generic. But but you get the idea.
323000	328000	Oh, we were walking here out of right all of us.
328000	336000	No, myself, my lover Cody and my squire, Steve Levy.
336000	341000	And we walked past. There was a guy standing in the doorway.
341000	344000	And I don't know what the what the PC.
344000	348000	If so, we used to just like five years ago, we just go homeless.
348000	351000	You know, you go, it's a homeless guy. And we kind of all go.
351000	354000	Yeah. And then we start to think like, well, wait, how many?
354000	358000	What if he has a home? But he's like, he's he's what do you say? Dirty.
358000	362000	He was a person of dirt.
362000	367000	It was it was it was it was a filth American.
367000	370000	I think you should keep going.
370000	374000	Just keep grabbing it. It feels like you're going in the right direction.
374000	378000	Yeah, I will definitely hit a sensitive spot.
378000	381000	Yeah, that's how that's how sensitive it works.
381000	386000	Just just throw throw shit against the wall. That's not how racism starts.
386000	390000	What is he, a peanut, a peanut?
390000	392000	I mean, we should talk about whether or not this person deserved it.
392000	395000	You know what I mean? Just get right to that.
395000	399000	I would definitely say no, because, you know, I'm a rebel.
399000	402000	Like, I don't I think our economic system is is flawed.
402000	404000	I think I'm overpaid for what I do.
404000	408000	I'm sure he's underpaid for lurking in the doorway.
408000	411000	I would I would give him at least a dollar more an hour to do that.
411000	416000	Then I take it away from the job of complaining about networks.
416000	420000	I like this. This is kind of nice because you're the you're the Bernie.
420000	422000	I'm the Hillary.
422000	424000	Are you used to it?
424000	426000	Not like about not about people that live on the street,
426000	428000	but just about every other issue. You know what I mean?
428000	432000	Like, I agree with you on that. Can I be Trump?
432000	435000	OK.
435000	440000	I think I think Trump's success is due to the idea that we can all be Trump.
440000	446000	Right. It has so little to do with acquiring anything and so much to do with letting go.
446000	449000	Right. So much that has burdened us.
449000	452000	Yeah. I hate stuff.
452000	463000	It's like what if I just what if I just what if I what if my brain was a rocket in its final stage and all of the thrusters fell away leaving only the lizard cortex.
463000	468000	Just just just just like I'm a winner. You're a loser.
468000	479000	You just hit the moon and blow it up and sell the chunks to yourself and then lie about how much you did and just fucking like that guy's amazing.
479000	483000	OK. So we were walking and we walked past a lurker in a doorway.
483000	489000	A skexy and a dark crystal looking up.
489000	497000	And so and he and he like just as we got like it was like this is a normal site.
497000	500000	There's a person in the doorway. That's not there's no threat.
500000	505000	Nothing's going to happen. And then right is my ear was in his mouth.
505000	512000	He he made this sound and I wrote it down. I spelled it P.L.O.U.M.P.
512000	516000	He went like right as I went away with it.
516000	523000	And I see scared the shit out of me. I jumped like a cat seeing a pickle.
523000	529000	Look it up YouTube cats think. Have you seen the cat pickle video cucumber?
529000	533000	I don't know. I think cucumbers. Yeah. But I bet a pickle would work for a smaller cat.
533000	541000	Yeah. Cats think. What do they think it is that cats cats. That's the theory.
541000	545000	We I'd like to think there's a couple of theories cat cats.
545000	551000	Like there's just a million YouTube montages of people. If you put a cucumber out of the line of sight of a cat.
551000	556000	When the cat sees the cucumber it freaks the fuck out.
556000	561000	Like it leaps 10 feet in the air because it thinks I guess it thinks it's a snake.
561000	565000	Yeah. I mean I get I grew up in Chicago. So I understand that reaction to raw vegetables.
565000	576000	Hey oh a lot of meat in that area. Not for me. You're suspicious. You're suspicious of the regular what.
576000	583000	So the guy went plop and and I freaked out. But when I looked at him he wasn't looking at me.
583000	590000	Which I was marveling at it once we were a tasteful block away. I'm not going to talk shit about the you know as I walked through King's Landing.
590000	595000	I'm not going to I'm not going to talk about the low born like in front of them.
595000	600000	I wait until we're near the red red keep or whatever it's called.
600000	606000	And I said what was that all about. That guy scared the living piss out of me.
606000	611000	And then he wasn't looking at me. So he wasn't doing it for my benefit. It's just kind of weird.
611000	616000	And then and then Steve Levy said isn't it possible he had schizophrenia.
616000	621000	Beat beat beat. And I was like yeah great. What the fuck. Fuck you.
621000	626000	OK. Great. Yes of course it's possible. Yes. It's very likely.
626000	630000	But I remember that umbrella. What was his motivation.
630000	639000	And then Cody said my girlfriend said I think he might have been signaling the other guy because there was another guy coming up the sidewalk and they did have some kind of rapport.
639000	643000	I have nowhere to go with the story but it's just like to like that's the opposite of schizophrenia.
643000	650000	That's like velociraptor signaling like the idea that that's like high functioning like shit.
650000	655000	And the other theory is that the guy thought I was a dragon or I'm not making fun.
655000	660000	I am making fun of mental illness. I'm making I'm generating fun out of it.
660000	666000	I'm not trivializing the pain one endures when one is mentally ill.
666000	671000	It's bizarre to move to Los Angeles and see you know because it's beautiful outside.
671000	675000	And so you don't have to seek services. Again I'm from Chicago.
675000	678000	You could theoretically live. You could live. I'm from Milwaukee.
678000	681000	Outdoor for a very long time. And so people don't seek services.
681000	689000	Also L.A. is really shitty at providing this stuff. This is why at Harmon Town we are working hard to turn that around.
690000	696000	One of your major. Certainly all proceeds from Nerd Melt tonight are probably going to the homeless.
696000	701000	Yeah I'm sure. I talked to them about that. They said yes.
701000	708000	But it's intense because it's definitely. Yeah it sounds like sounds like maybe you figured out what had happened there.
708000	718000	You know like some did you see some. Well sometimes you see a person on the street and you and you want to say to yourself what happened here because I'm not a super amazing person.
718000	724000	I'm just a regular guy. I got cool jackets but I'm just a regular guy. How did I get so lucky to live this life.
724000	732000	And then my motivation to say nonsense words at a low at a loud volume. I'm able to suppress. Right.
732000	736000	And so then it's like well. Right. Congratulations to me.
736000	742000	Right. Yeah. And then I look I imagine me. I mean you seem like a more tactful person in general than me.
742000	751000	Obviously. I'm one step closer to that guy because I actually have a reputation for saying things out loud that you're not supposed to say at the wrong time.
751000	758000	I'm one step. I definitely. You've got that beard going on. There's a lot of stuff. I always go like there but for the grace of God.
758000	765000	Like it's just like it's a drop of this and a pinch of that. And it's like it's and also within the context of our society.
765000	771000	So it's even more tragic because it's like I think about when people have like oppositional defiant disorder.
771000	777000	It's like oh geez what a prick. That guy doesn't know how to work at a Kinko's. But it's like 500 years ago which is a.
777000	786000	It's no time at all in terms of humanity. Like I'm sure oppositional defiant disorder was like made you like the captain of the Kingsman.
786000	792000	World's best night. Yeah. Like you were probably probably like really paid to have like a hugely like dramatic personality.
792000	799000	And now we're just like I feel bad for anybody who's like who's like yeah who has no choice but to be like.
799000	807000	Right. Their shit doesn't fit into our shit. Maybe our shit's the problem. Also you know what else for folks that might even be here.
807000	814000	Or folks that that are able to deal with their stuff through like you know maybe medication other stuff like that.
814000	823000	Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. Now we never celebrated has happened. We don't celebrate that enough. We don't talk about people that are functional.
823000	835000	When you walk next time you walk past a crazy person on the street. Take the time to say yay. I'm sane. And then and then and then and then say to them I'm sorry you're crazy.
836000	849000	It'll it'll make everything better. OK. So you ever were you ever in a bar or a restaurant and you brought you got brought like a drink and it looked kind of tasty and you were like kind of surprised.
849000	858000	And then the waiter was like oh shit I'm sorry and like took it to a different table. Yeah for sure. What'd you get that happened. I was I was in New York.
858000	869000	I was I was I was with somebody and that happened and then and then we were joking about the fact that that actually what if that was a cool thing that that if you're super rich.
869000	882000	Like like that was a delicacy where you when you order your drink you're like like like I'll have the usual smithers and he goes like ah Manhattan straight up a pinch of lime briefly brought to the wrong table then taken away.
883000	895000	Right away sir. And that every time that's happening to you there's just like some cool ass dude that's made it to that level and is paying five hundred and eighty dollars for their drink.
895000	903000	And it's not it's not about like like it's just like they're they're they're convinced that they can just taste a hint of your disappointment.
904000	907000	That's the vermouth like.
907000	915000	If that's a service that you combine that with somebody making enough eye contact with you that you think they're saying hi to you. But then they're saying hi to somebody behind you.
915000	924000	They brought that shit together. If you could bottle that you get a drink for a second. They waved to you. Oh my God. Who are you.
924000	929000	I'm trying to place you. Thanks for getting me at the airport stranger. Oh them.
929000	941000	How many times has that happened to you versus how many times have you perceivably accidentally done that to somebody because I feel like I've never done that to anybody but I'm constantly getting milked.
941000	952000	No. There is another thing that's happening more and more and I don't know how I mean obviously you're recognizable from this but I will say you know my face is something that I sell for my business.
952000	960000	You sell your television show. I saw this face. She makes an organic to be worn by Kim Basinger in the original Batman as you know.
960000	970000	But my point is I never saw it. Fuck you. That's very funny. That cannot be ignored.
970000	976000	No. Something I will do very frequently is like somebody looks at me. I kind of assume something is going on.
976000	992000	The best of the best example of this Dan if I may is that when we first moved to Los Angeles went to the dog park with my wife Rhea who you know and I said to Rhea that woman over there recognizes me and then Rhea said no.
992000	1004000	That is Sarah Paulson. You recognize her.
1004000	1007000	That's fantastic.
1007000	1012000	That's right. I'm 50 years too young for her anyway.
1012000	1015000	Okay. All right. New topic.
1015000	1016000	Moving on.
1016000	1017000	I think we're doing great.
1017000	1018000	We're killing it.
1018000	1019000	You're killing it.
1019000	1023000	No you are. I think it's you.
1023000	1025000	Oh Dan I think this is a nice pairing. I feel honored.
1025000	1026000	Spencer you're doing great.
1026000	1032000	No I think it's her. I think it's her.
1032000	1035000	All right. So here's a half baked thought.
1035000	1042000	I don't think I've talked about this up here before but I my brain is Swiss cheese and every day is an adventure.
1042000	1052000	Someone just stop me really but really stop me if it's like I talked about this three weeks ago should somebody say I don't want to be that guy.
1052000	1063000	I feel like I feel like okay so like ugly people.
1063000	1065000	No this is this sounds new. This sounds new.
1065000	1067000	Oh I should. I had a chance there.
1067000	1068000	I should advise.
1068000	1073000	I feel like race in America.
1073000	1081000	I feel like so ugly people and attractive people should be better friends.
1081000	1099000	And I don't know if they'd outnumber everyone who's neither ugly nor attractive but I'm curious about that because I know for sure that the clothing industry the concept of fashion was neither developed nor is dependent upon by the ugly or the attractive
1099000	1113000	because as we all know attractive people can wear anything and not to not to cross any boundaries but what reminded me of this is your wife walked into the green room wearing a like a baseball jersey.
1113000	1125000	Amazing baseball pants and like the socks pulled up to halfway up the calf and she had a baseball cap on and stuff but she's real butcher so it was like yeah we'll come out and show him.
1126000	1131000	Look at this real pull your shirt down in the back.
1131000	1133000	Pull your shirt down in the back. You're welcome.
1133000	1136000	Oh okay.
1136000	1139000	She came from a baseball game.
1139000	1150000	Well so but I thought because I was like no I was like oh it's like Andrew McCarthy wearing bowling shoes and mannequin like it's like it's like I that could have easily just been a fashion choice.
1150000	1156000	Because because an attractive person can wear anything and then everyone would just be like oh should I be wearing that.
1156000	1159000	So can an ugly person.
1159000	1166000	I wear whatever the fuck I want and everyone's like okay well I'm assuming he got lost somewhere and confused.
1166000	1171000	So I have no beef with attractive people and nor are they with me.
1171000	1177000	We don't have to fight about fashion and rules of clothing and color coordination or shape or anything like that.
1177000	1188000	It's these medium people these people for whom the slightest variation in a shirt or pant can make all the difference in this war.
1188000	1194000	Well where the middle god it's a game of yards and inches their tyranny.
1194000	1199000	We suffer from and I have a feeling like way more ugly and attractive people than there are these.
1199000	1203000	Who are these mythical fucking schlub nubs.
1203000	1209000	These these these mug dwarfs what do they call him in Harry Harry Harry Potter's son.
1209000	1211000	Don't you feel like there's also there's a.
1211000	1213000	These middle middle mix.
1213000	1216000	It's yeah that's what it is.
1216000	1218000	It's so it's McNuggets.
1218000	1222000	You're thinking of McNuggets.
1222000	1223000	By the way.
1223000	1224000	Oh shit.
1224000	1225000	God damn it.
1225000	1226000	Not to get off on a tangent.
1226000	1232000	But like two nights ago I was about to go to sleep.
1232000	1236000	Then the last thought I had before I went to sleep and I did tweet this.
1236000	1239000	But this is the first time I've ever said it out loud besides Syria.
1239000	1250000	But last night the last thought I had for as my eyes were closing I sat right up in bed and I said oh chicken nuggets are chicken nougat.
1250000	1252000	Think about that.
1252000	1254000	Do you know like nougat texture.
1254000	1258000	Have you ever seen a nugget get me a chicken nugget is chicken nougat.
1258000	1259000	That is the most.
1259000	1263000	That's amazing that a human brain can come up with that.
1263000	1268000	Anyway I don't mean to like to my own horn but Jesus.
1268000	1269000	Sidebar.
1269000	1276000	But my point is I just got I just do it but like chicken nuggets are chicken nougat.
1276000	1277000	Do you know what I'm saying.
1277000	1279000	I got distracted by something.
1279000	1281000	I remembered something tangentially.
1281000	1283000	Was it chicken nuggets are chicken nougat.
1283000	1294000	No it's I just remembered because you're you're talking about talking and I attacked my girlfriend physically in my sleep.
1294000	1296000	I'm sorry that happened to her.
1296000	1299000	How'd that happen.
1300000	1314000	I was having a dream that a in the dream a a man who looked like my brother and who but who was Jeff Davis.
1314000	1318000	I had the voice of Jeff Davis with the face of my brother.
1318000	1328000	I made that mask that they were just antagonizing me and they just kept antagonizing me and they were like threatening me and like like they just they just they were doing everything they could.
1329000	1333000	The dream culminated in me going that's it. I'm going to solve this problem.
1333000	1344000	The the the the the you know the way the way my archetype I guess in their cortex like and I and I woke up to Cody going like baby baby.
1344000	1348000	And I was like hitting her face.
1348000	1354000	Now luckily there wasn't a one to one analog to like what I was doing in the dream in which I was like he man.
1354000	1356000	I don't know if they chalk that up to just bad.
1356000	1362000	I'm just not fit or I would hope that it's like no matter how hard you try to kill someone like in your side.
1362000	1367000	But she I just thought you were mentioning the how did she respond.
1367000	1368000	Is she OK.
1368000	1371000	It doesn't even make any sense how she responded.
1371000	1373000	She was like she was like baby baby you're sleeping.
1373000	1374000	Wake up.
1374000	1377000	And I was like oh and then I was like oh god oh god.
1377000	1378000	She's like it's fine.
1378000	1379000	It's fine.
1380000	1381000	That makes tons of sense.
1381000	1382000	That makes sense.
1382000	1383000	I am terrified of everything.
1383000	1384000	I can't watch scary movies.
1384000	1386000	I have a lifelong fear of the dark.
1386000	1393000	I sleep with the lights on and like a lot as an adult now when I'm out of town.
1393000	1396000	Rhea is a sleepwalker and she will wake up in the middle of the night.
1396000	1400000	She'll sit up in bed and go no no.
1400000	1401000	All right.
1401000	1403000	Let's let's bring out Rhea Butcher everybody.
1407000	1409000	That's true though.
1409000	1411000	Actually I should have waited until.
1411000	1412000	Well go there.
1412000	1416000	If you sit then it means that I get to sit and I'm so fat.
1416000	1418000	But I want to have I want to have a theory.
1418000	1420000	Let's talk about this for one second.
1420000	1422000	But I do want to address what you said because you know what I'll stand.
1422000	1424000	Hey this is my thought on this.
1425000	1429000	I think really attractive really unattractive.
1429000	1431000	I think that's that's an overlap.
1431000	1433000	That's a zipper.
1433000	1434000	Oh you're back to that.
1434000	1436000	Because you fucking injector seated from that shit.
1436000	1437000	I know.
1437000	1438000	I was talking about that.
1438000	1440000	You're like big nuggets.
1440000	1441000	I'm sorry.
1441000	1442000	I was like fine.
1442000	1444000	I mean I agree that that's also important.
1444000	1447000	What I said about chicken nuggets are chicken nugget.
1447000	1455000	But I do think that I think human faces have like illicit a reaction from us.
1455000	1460000	There's a stupid meme that's been everywhere that's like Angelina Jolie and Steve Buscemi at the same age.
1460000	1463000	And it's like what in the world they look exactly the same.
1463000	1465000	Have people seen this?
1465000	1466000	No.
1466000	1467000	Exactly the same.
1467000	1468000	They have the same face.
1468000	1469000	Hi Rhea.
1469000	1470000	Hi.
1470000	1472000	Is it true you're a psychopath in your sleep?
1472000	1473000	Yes.
1473000	1474000	One hundred percent true.
1474000	1475000	Do you walk?
1475000	1476000	Well I get up.
1476000	1477000	I don't know.
1477000	1479000	Because I talk the talk in my sleep.
1479000	1480000	Sure yeah.
1480000	1485000	I mean I talk a lot in my sleep and then I also get up and then I sort of do this.
1485000	1487000	Oh oh oh.
1487000	1489000	Oh oh.
1489000	1491000	For non subscribers.
1491000	1492000	Yeah.
1492000	1495000	No matter how attractive the person.
1495000	1497000	Not a position you want to find them in.
1497000	1500000	You cannot make sleepwalking look good.
1500000	1502000	I don't care how hot you are.
1502000	1505000	You're always going to be like.
1505000	1507000	Like standing over your wife.
1507000	1508000	I did that once.
1508000	1509000	I started tucking.
1509000	1510000	No.
1510000	1515000	Just tucking me into bed.
1515000	1517000	The worst.
1517000	1518000	Pretty bad.
1518000	1523000	And you're like you're awake and going like thank you.
1524000	1526000	Tapping me.
1526000	1528000	Everything must be tucked.
1528000	1532000	Untucked things must be tucked or die.
1532000	1533000	I'm tucked.
1533000	1536000	Thank you.
1536000	1537000	Your job is done.
1537000	1541000	Back to sleepy time.
1541000	1543000	But it is like full on screaming.
1543000	1545000	No no no.
1545000	1547000	Then right back to bed.
1547000	1548000	Then.
1548000	1549000	Then our.
1549000	1550000	Oh.
1550000	1551000	Oh no.
1551000	1554000	We have an ensuite bathroom that had a short.
1554000	1555000	Yeah that's right.
1555000	1557000	And ensuite is what you just said.
1557000	1558000	Yeah.
1558000	1560000	That almost drifted away.
1560000	1563000	I guess it went to my lobe where I was like a straight guilt.
1563000	1565000	I was like it's lesbian talk.
1565000	1567000	It's lesbian talk.
1567000	1570000	Unsuite means like they respect you as an equal.
1570000	1571000	Hey.
1571000	1572000	A wall of dildos.
1572000	1574000	That's what it means.
1574000	1575000	A wall of dildos.
1575000	1578000	A deodorant dildo toothbrush.
1578000	1581000	It's when you walk in there and you go oh sweet.
1581000	1583000	That's why it's called that.
1583000	1589000	It's just a bunch of chapstick and Subaru owner's manuals.
1589000	1590000	Yeah.
1590000	1591000	You got it.
1591000	1592000	I'm trying to.
1592000	1593000	That's what I brushed my teeth with.
1593000	1594000	You got them?
1594000	1596000	Just a Subaru manual.
1596000	1598000	I'm right up to date on my lesbian crochets.
1598000	1599000	Yeah.
1599000	1601000	I swear I looked it up just decades ago.
1601000	1602000	Yeah.
1602000	1605000	Yeah yeah yeah.
1605000	1606000	Anyways.
1606000	1607000	Oh wait.
1607000	1609000	That means a bathroom that's connected to your bedroom.
1609000	1610000	Yeah.
1610000	1611000	So.
1611000	1612000	Unsuite.
1612000	1614000	You walk through it to get to another room.
1614000	1616000	It just means it's connected to your bedroom.
1616000	1617000	So you can see from your bedroom.
1617000	1618000	All right property brothers.
1618000	1619000	Whatever.
1619000	1620000	Oh okay.
1620000	1621000	Okay okay okay.
1621000	1625000	That's the only reason I use that word is because you can see it from our bed.
1625000	1626000	Right.
1626000	1628000	And for a while there was a short in our light switch.
1628000	1630000	And in the middle of the night it would turn on.
1630000	1631000	The lights would turn on.
1631000	1633000	And there was no one in there.
1633000	1636000	So imagine like you wake up your wife is like no.
1636000	1637000	No.
1637000	1639000	Goes back to bed.
1639000	1643000	Lights go on.
1643000	1644000	Pretty terrifying.
1644000	1646000	But not for me.
1646000	1648000	I was asleep the whole time.
1648000	1649000	So.
1649000	1653000	Then our little eight pound dog gets up starts like.
1653000	1654000	Oh shit.
1654000	1655000	Yep.
1655000	1656000	Dogs know what's up.
1656000	1657000	I know.
1657000	1660000	The dogs can see ghosts like for sure.
1660000	1661000	For sure.
1661000	1664000	I was I was I was a girlfriend in my 20s.
1664000	1667000	I was visiting my parents and I was in bed with her.
1667000	1669000	And I thought I was awake.
1669000	1672000	And I thought I rolled over in my wakefulness.
1672000	1678000	And thought that I recognized that there was a gray alien in bed with me.
1678000	1681000	Just mocking me and going like cool.
1681000	1684000	And I and I did what you would do.
1684000	1685000	I went like.
1685000	1688000	And like like like pushed the alien away.
1688000	1691000	Because if a gray alien climbs into bed with you.
1691000	1693000	And pulls the covers over itself.
1693000	1695000	And waits for you to roll over.
1695000	1696000	Waits it out.
1696000	1698000	It's probably if you start to push it away.
1698000	1700000	You'll have the element of surprise.
1700000	1701000	Absolutely.
1701000	1702000	Oh my god.
1702000	1703000	It's not going to expect you to do that.
1703000	1706000	That weird gray alien is like oh no my plan.
1706000	1709000	I had no idea he would react like a monkey would.
1709000	1712000	Oh push it now.
1712000	1713000	Retreat.
1713000	1714000	Retreat.
1714000	1715000	Call off the global strike.
1715000	1717000	They know how to flail.
1717000	1719000	Push.
1719000	1724000	I covered most of my body with the quilt.
1724000	1727000	We'll have no success in this invasion.
1727000	1731000	Signed Marco Polonio.
1731000	1732000	Meep mop moop.
1732000	1734000	He's like the anyways.
1734000	1735000	I get it.
1735000	1737000	Well I guess that's the end of the story.
1737000	1741000	I'm just like alarmed that I'm capable of let's face it.
1741000	1744000	Violence in my sleep that will affect my lover.
1744000	1745000	Yeah.
1745000	1746000	I was very very disconcerting to me.
1746000	1750000	I also recently woke up because I haven't been walking around but I have been waking myself up.
1750000	1756000	Usually like I'll fall asleep at 11 and then I wake up an hour later and I go every night.
1756000	1759000	So I sleep well is what I'm saying.
1759000	1765000	And the other night I fell asleep and then an hour later I had a dream wherein I was being shot.
1765000	1767000	Like point blank like this close.
1767000	1774000	Somebody had a gun shot me in the gut and I went and I can't even make the noise again.
1774000	1777000	Because I actually made the noise that I would make if I was shot.
1777000	1782000	And it was because I woke up and was like oh my god that's what it'd be like to be shot.
1782000	1788000	And that's the sound I'm gonna make.
1788000	1789000	Damn it.
1789000	1793000	I didn't think I could fear getting shot more than.
1793000	1798000	Now when the bullets coming I'm gonna be like this isn't gonna end well.
1798000	1800000	Look at how tough I am.
1801000	1807000	I thought maybe I would be one of those people that just stands there with a blank face while their guts like spring it on.
1807000	1815000	Because maybe the one thing you can count on me to do is just be so lazy and unalert that I get shot and I look like John Wayne.
1815000	1818000	Because I'm like I didn't know what I am.
1818000	1821000	I talk in my sleep apparently like constantly.
1821000	1824000	Cody is charmed by it and records it.
1824000	1826000	Here's some more things about Cody.
1826000	1833000	Again apparently if you hit her in the face while she's sleeping she will wake up say stop hitting me you're asleep.
1833000	1838000	And then when you are mortified she'll go it's okay and go to sleep.
1838000	1849000	Whereas I for instance I had a girlfriend once who apparently had a I awoke to a girlfriend smashing me in the face with her open palm because she was dreaming that I had a centipede on my face.
1849000	1850000	Oh Christ.
1851000	1858000	How her augmented dream reality included the real topography of my real face and she's like I mean what am I talking.
1858000	1859000	How am I to talk.
1859000	1862000	Why was I in bed with an alien in my parents house in Florida.
1863000	1867000	But I don't remember being magnanimous.
1867000	1874000	It's not like I believe I looked at it as an opportunity to be outraged waking up to being smashed in the face.
1874000	1875000	Yeah I didn't.
1875000	1881000	It never occurred to me that it was an opportunity to be forgiving or cool at all.
1881000	1884000	I was more like shopping spree.
1884000	1886000	I get to be like what the fuck man.
1886000	1887000	I'm sorry.
1887000	1888000	I'm sorry.
1888000	1897000	No it's just you fucking but fuck man just like you go to bed with someone and you know it's like a social contract.
1898000	1903000	I give you my heart a centipede dream.
1903000	1905000	That's what you think of me.
1906000	1911000	I don't I don't know if I did all of that but I feel like that's what I did some of that in.
1911000	1912000	That's nice.
1912000	1924000	So I'm with a girlfriend who who it's like it there's a there's a there's a well I'm not going to spiral into self-deprecation but but she's a better person than me and I don't deserve her.
1924000	1928000	And and and and and and she has recordings of me.
1928000	1934000	Oh she's also charmed my my my my gibberish sleep talk because I just I just say I don't even use parts of speech.
1934000	1938000	I just say like it's hard to do an impression of it because I'm just like speaking in tongues.
1938000	1939000	Yeah.
1941000	1943000	Like there's no verbs or nouns.
1948000	1951000	That's what I usually say which is just like music to all of your ears.
1951000	1952000	I'm sure.
1953000	1956000	Yeah but for real none of that comes out of your mouth.
1956000	1958000	Do you know that I know you don't really say that shit.
1958000	1959000	Then what do I say.
1961000	1962000	No.
1962000	1963000	Okay.
1964000	1965000	No.
1965000	1971000	I used to say I used to say more than no because I was a child and I didn't understand the world yet.
1971000	1973000	Now I'm an adult and I'm just like no.
1977000	1979000	That is halfway to death right now.
1980000	1985000	Hey Cody if you're listening you don't have it's it's it won't pay off so you don't you don't have to do this.
1985000	1997000	But if it if you have the if you have the audio file that video file that you took of me talking to my sleep in Palm Springs and you text it to me I'll be able to access it fast.
1997000	1998000	Wow.
1998000	2002000	If you've just tuned in this is a great show in town behind the scenes.
2002000	2003000	Okay.
2003000	2004000	All right.
2004000	2006000	Well I'll give you guys a choice of what we talk about next.
2006000	2007000	Oh.
2008000	2009000	Okay.
2009000	2010000	We talked about plump.
2012000	2013000	Talked about the ordering the drink thing.
2013000	2015000	I thought I really shined there.
2015000	2016000	That really landed.
2017000	2019000	It's like did I make a mistake giving up stand up.
2019000	2020000	That was great.
2023000	2025000	We could talk about Beyonce.
2025000	2026000	Oh.
2026000	2027000	Oh my.
2027000	2028000	Wait what.
2029000	2030000	Big otters.
2030000	2031000	I think we got a full stop on.
2031000	2032000	Oh sorry.
2032000	2034000	I just mean you know we also.
2034000	2035000	Oh did you say otters.
2037000	2038000	But we can we can do both.
2038000	2039000	We can get to it.
2039000	2040000	But Beyonce is a bigger.
2041000	2044000	You talk about Beyonce and otters so much.
2045000	2047000	I got so much to say about those two topics.
2048000	2053000	But yo best way to see Beyonce surrounded by otters for real.
2054000	2055000	Like when you watch this.
2055000	2056000	What is this lemonade.
2056000	2057000	Is that her.
2057000	2058000	Like I have.
2058000	2062000	I have a lot of 43 year old questions about what's happening.
2062000	2063000	What is this lemonade.
2063000	2064000	Does she like to drink it.
2064000	2065000	I don't understand what's going on.
2065000	2066000	So she.
2066000	2067000	So she.
2067000	2068000	So she.
2068000	2069000	She.
2069000	2070000	She.
2070000	2074000	She's struggling with the with the feelings of of the the the the adultery concept and
2074000	2077000	but but but the the crazy thing is that it's through his label.
2077000	2079000	But is he is he producing it.
2079000	2084000	Is he like behind a board when she's like producing those songs and going like OK.
2084000	2086000	Baby let's let's take that again.
2086000	2093000	When you hit when you hit the phrase like I can smell her perfume on your dick like like
2093000	2094000	like just really lean into it.
2094000	2096000	Like remember how much it hurts.
2096000	2097000	Yeah.
2098000	2100000	Because I don't want another shitty album out of you.
2100000	2105000	When you say boy by I want you to also be dividing our bank accounts.
2106000	2107000	You know what.
2107000	2108000	I don't care.
2108000	2109000	That's what I've decided about that question.
2109000	2110000	I tell you why.
2110000	2111000	I don't know.
2111000	2116000	And I think he was a producer on those tracks because I read all the track listings and
2116000	2118000	Carter was not one of the names on it.
2118000	2121000	Knowles however was a name every single song on lemonade.
2121000	2127000	By the way every single song.
2127000	2128000	Yeah.
2128000	2132000	Well because what I was going to say is I think you know what it doesn't it doesn't
2132000	2138000	matter to me whether or not it's real or whether or not it happened or whether or not it's
2138000	2140000	him or whether or not she wrote those songs.
2140000	2144000	There was like a huge when when lemonade first came out everybody was like and then there
2144000	2152000	was weird white guy backlash where sad white guys go like well for a minute we talked about
2152000	2153000	another thing.
2153000	2154000	Right.
2154000	2155000	Than me.
2155000	2156000	Right.
2157000	2161000	And there was a lot of like she didn't and what I it's a me we went to see her at the
2161000	2162000	Rose Bowl.
2162000	2163000	Yes.
2163000	2164000	Weekends ago.
2164000	2168000	Wait so so just to get back to so there there's a sort of that seems like just sort of general
2168000	2173000	internet erosion like like like yeah and I'll definitely as a spokesman for fat white straight
2173000	2179000	guys that are that are outside that I'll speak I bet we're very represented in that swarm of
2179000	2184000	that of people that are like oh this thing that was amazing that really just grabbed us and we
2184000	2189000	all we all and then there's a sort of like weird erosion that so I just I'm curious about the
2189000	2196000	specifics of that like people people are going like she doesn't really believe in this is that
2196000	2201000	like they just sort of questioning the magic of it like that and also like did it happen when how
2202000	2204000	much was it where were the hotels.
2204000	2205000	Well okay.
2205000	2207000	I want to see the semen you know like everybody gets.
2207000	2212000	But she's not singing about is I mean for my now I'm now I'm now I'm Beyonce explaining to
2213000	2215000	I'm dance playing to Beyonce.
2215000	2219000	But I mean I'm assuming she's not singing about a Colombo plot.
2219000	2220000	She's not going to.
2220000	2222000	Here's my here's my evidence.
2222000	2224000	She's talking about her.
2224000	2226000	She's talking about what's going on for her.
2226000	2228000	That's what I heard the five minutes I heard of it.
2228000	2229000	Terrifying.
2229000	2234000	Before I was watching on her phone I heard it was like oh she's coping with the feelings like
2234000	2240000	like which are largely it especially doesn't matter whether they're true or not because it's
2240000	2245000	like empowerment songs and so in order to make empowerment songs you have to be wronged and so
2245000	2247000	like she's setting up the idea that she was wronged.
2247000	2252000	Also she's a black woman so like you know straight up she's been wronged like what's for
2252000	2255000	real like there's been some times where she has been wronged.
2255000	2258000	I don't know if you guys know about black people.
2258000	2260000	And women.
2260000	2262000	And a black woman.
2262000	2263000	Yes.
2263000	2268000	Just speaking as a white woman just trying to tell you guys what it's like to be a black woman.
2270000	2273000	Because I may be a lesbian but I'm still white.
2273000	2274000	Right.
2274000	2277000	And there's certain duties that are incumbent upon me.
2277000	2278000	Yes.
2278000	2281000	Just when you thought I had perspective.
2281000	2284000	Damn this lack of melanin.
2285000	2289000	Yeah okay so that was us talking about Beyonce.
2289000	2292000	Now I'd like to talk about Kanye.
2292000	2293000	Oh great.
2293000	2294000	Let's hear it.
2294000	2299000	Okay so stop booking him on your talk shows just so he can talk crazy and then marveling
2299000	2300000	at him talking crazy.
2300000	2301000	I've been over this.
2301000	2303000	He has seven number one albums.
2303000	2305000	We've given him permission to be crazy.
2305000	2306000	You know he's crazy.
2306000	2310000	It's like if you invite Gary Busey on your thing except it's better because Gary Busey
2310000	2312000	doesn't have seven number one albums.
2313000	2321000	And it's like I honestly I can't I can't I don't want to I don't like I'm in this guy's
2321000	2323000	corner no matter what he does until you hit somebody.
2323000	2327000	Yeah like he hasn't pooped or peed or hit anybody.
2327000	2332000	And he just keeps all he does is like I read the the transcripts of like he was on Ellen
2332000	2336000	and oh he kept talking and boy he's crazy.
2336000	2338000	It's like well what did you think.
2338000	2339000	What do you.
2339000	2340000	What's it.
2340000	2341000	What did you.
2341000	2342000	What are you going to come out.
2342000	2344000	So let's put him in our same segment.
2344000	2347000	And so he'll just give us the weather right.
2347000	2348000	And he'll be totally accurate.
2348000	2349000	We won't have to check that.
2349000	2356000	No you're like parading him out and then asking him anything Kanye toast toast makes me think
2356000	2358000	of Picasso Picasso makes me think of me.
2358000	2359000	Me as a genius.
2359000	2361000	Einstein is a genius but nobody can feel this.
2361000	2363000	I can't feel this when I wore a shirt to jacket.
2363000	2364000	I went to school.
2364000	2366000	That's a fucking like I just that's all about what you do.
2366000	2368000	It's about the rhymes you put on your pants and then you put on your shoes.
2368000	2369000	Stephen Hawking can do it.
2369000	2370000	I can do it.
2370000	2371000	Van Gogh can do it.
2371000	2372000	Who are these people.
2372000	2373000	They're dead now.
2373000	2379000	That's why I feel that Black Lives Matter or whatever he's like and everyone's like
2379000	2381000	like oh he ranted or he's crazy.
2381000	2387000	I just like I just want to say he needs my support and I'm on his team.
2387000	2392000	I can't get through a single one of his number one albums but I love his personality there.
2392000	2395000	Isn't it interesting that he and Beyonce are having this moment at the same time.
2395000	2399000	They're having like parallel moments but I think she is very indicative of like the female
2399000	2400000	experience in 2016.
2400000	2405000	I think he's a little bit indicative of the male experience because he is the most interesting
2405000	2408000	thing he can do right now is like completely melt down.
2408000	2413000	He has so much power and be like oh it's too much and I am crushed and then Beyonce is
2413000	2415000	like you want to see crushed look at these thighs.
2415000	2417000	I will sit on you.
2417000	2421000	Women have to be like in charge of their brand and they're like fuck you boys.
2421000	2422000	Also look at all this.
2422000	2423000	Can't touch it.
2423000	2424000	Get away.
2424000	2425000	Come here.
2425000	2426000	So serious.
2426000	2428000	It's Hillary and Bernie.
2428000	2429000	I'm fucking telling you.
2429000	2430000	Dude's hair is crazy.
2430000	2431000	Oh we're like accurate.
2431000	2432000	Ladies are in power suits.
2432000	2435000	This is where we are man.
2435000	2438000	2016 man.
2438000	2445000	Cameron Esposito's meltdown on Harmontown will leave you speechless.
2445000	2447000	You won't believe what she said.
2447000	2452000	Also one of those articles it's like what are you typing about a thing that happened
2452000	2453000	on fucking TV.
2453000	2454000	TV's already on the internet.
2454000	2455000	I fucking hate all of you.
2455000	2460000	It's like oh here's a person that's one of the eight interesting people left in the world
2460000	2463000	because his craziness hasn't fit down the drain yet.
2463000	2465000	Like oh I'm Picasso.
2465000	2468000	I love I love I love Aquafresh.
2468000	2470000	What Picasso?
2470000	2471000	Aquafresh.
2471000	2473000	Get a room.
2473000	2475000	Click click click click.
2475000	2476000	You're crazy.
2476000	2477000	You're the crazy person.
2477000	2478000	You're a drone.
2478000	2480000	Did he really say he liked Aquafresh?
2480000	2481000	No.
2481000	2482000	Damn.
2482000	2484000	I was about to be like I'm into Kanye now.
2484000	2486000	I'm into Kanye now.
2486000	2489000	I like Aquafresh.
2489000	2494000	But also like shout out to Ellen for having like multiple video scandals in the last couple
2494000	2496000	months and just like staying relevant.
2496000	2497000	What else did she have?
2497000	2498000	What was her name?
2498000	2502000	Well just like people are yelling about weird like Hillary was on the show she was dancing
2502000	2506000	and everybody was like that's not the right that's cultural appropriation.
2506000	2508000	Did she like word of a dab or something like that?
2508000	2511000	But also like I love like where to stay relevant Ellen?
2511000	2515000	Where to fucking get in there and fight man?
2515000	2517000	Just keeping your shit going with weird.
2517000	2519000	Weird animated gifs.
2519000	2520000	Yeah.
2520000	2521000	Wasn't her show on every day?
2521000	2524000	It would be weird if she didn't have relevant people on.
2524000	2525000	Like that's like.
2525000	2527000	Well but she's also like old school talk show.
2527000	2528000	You know what I mean?
2528000	2535000	Like James Corden is like this is a full functioning dance club and airplane inside of a taxicab.
2535000	2539000	And we are also doing two minutes and everybody that gets in this will be the most famous
2539000	2540000	person you've ever seen.
2540000	2543000	We're doing karaoke where they sing each other's songs.
2543000	2546000	And Ellen's just like oh I'm just gonna dance.
2546000	2548000	Well she must be doing something right.
2548000	2551000	She's been on the air for I've never seen it.
2551000	2555000	She seems to be having a wonderful time.
2555000	2556000	Do you know what's weird?
2556000	2557000	I've seen the show.
2557000	2558000	Can you believe that?
2558000	2560000	Do you know Tig Nataro?
2560000	2561000	Because we were talking about.
2561000	2564000	I know Tig.
2564000	2565000	Hey you know what Dan?
2565000	2571000	Good one.
2571000	2575000	I've been waiting for like six years to do that.
2575000	2578000	I'm very happy about it.
2578000	2579000	All right.
2579000	2580000	Peak TV.
2580000	2581000	Cookie Tapper 2.
2581000	2583000	Simon and Garfunkel.
2583000	2584000	Big Otters.
2584000	2585000	Oh.
2585000	2590000	I told the director of Great Minds to come on the show tonight.
2590000	2593000	Let's bring out Heath Cohen.
2594000	2596000	No you sit there.
2596000	2598000	There he is.
2598000	2599000	Oh.
2599000	2601000	You brought your own.
2601000	2602000	Bullet.
2602000	2604000	Your name stuck in my throat.
2604000	2608000	I thought for a second there in my drunkenness I was like Cullen.
2608000	2610000	There's an S right?
2610000	2611000	S.
2611000	2613000	But you didn't call me Keith so we're okay.
2613000	2614000	Who decides that?
2614000	2617000	Do you think last names at a certain point were all singular?
2617000	2618000	And then.
2618000	2619000	Ours was.
2619000	2623000	It was just a couple of generations ago that we added the S.
2623000	2626000	So your theory is one for one as far as.
2626000	2627000	I've ruined the show.
2627000	2630000	I'm so sorry also about all those vampire books.
2630000	2632000	I'm sure that was rough for a while.
2632000	2633000	It was hard.
2633000	2635000	Oh sorry guys.
2635000	2636000	Spoiler alert.
2636000	2640000	Do you not follow vampire books?
2640000	2642000	They're vampires?
2642000	2643000	Edward Cullen.
2643000	2644000	Yeah.
2644000	2646000	Well it's Cullen, singular.
2646000	2647000	Yeah.
2647000	2648000	Cause he's from a while.
2648000	2649000	Like oh he's a vampire.
2649000	2651000	He's been around for like a long time.
2651000	2654000	They immigrated a long time ago.
2654000	2657000	Alright here's our segment where we talk about otters.
2657000	2659000	Oh shit.
2659000	2661000	So there's these otters in the.
2661000	2663000	Let's just show the audience the video.
2663000	2664000	We can't.
2664000	2665000	Wait we got your phone.
2665000	2666000	It's huge.
2666000	2669000	Just pass your phone around.
2669000	2672000	Don't old shame me.
2672000	2676000	There's these otters I think in the Amazon right?
2676000	2677000	Amazon.
2677000	2678000	Yeah.
2678000	2679000	Amazonian river otters.
2679000	2682000	Amazon prime otters?
2682000	2684000	No millennial.
2684000	2687000	It's a river.
2687000	2695000	Not of savings.
2695000	2697000	When's the last time you've seen the sun?
2697000	2701000	She has dirt from a baseball diamond on her.
2701000	2707000	These otters, they call them river wolves.
2707000	2708000	That's right.
2708000	2709000	Terrifying.
2709000	2710000	But really that's kind of.
2710000	2713000	I shouldn't have said that because it's more interesting to think that.
2713000	2714000	Okay there's these otters.
2714000	2716000	But they hunt caiman.
2716000	2718000	You know what caiman are?
2718000	2721000	Fucking alligator n-bum.
2721000	2725000	Oh no I just thought you forgot how to talk about the guys with the very long brow.
2725000	2726000	They lived a while ago.
2726000	2727000	No those are cavemen.
2727000	2728000	Cavemen.
2728000	2729000	Cavemen.
2729000	2730000	Yeah.
2730000	2731000	No.
2731000	2732000	Yeah.
2732000	2733000	Just like these are.
2733000	2737000	Don't make the mistake of thinking of caiman as a baby tiny alligator.
2737000	2738000	They come as big as alligators.
2738000	2739000	Yeah almost.
2739000	2740000	No.
2740000	2741000	Big enough to be scary.
2741000	2742000	They're like five feet right?
2742000	2743000	That's what.
2743000	2744000	Five feet.
2744000	2746920	But if you see that in front of you you're not going to be like oh that's just five feet
2746920	2747920	of a gator.
2747920	2751000	You're going to be like that's a fucking dinosaur.
2751000	2753320	I'm not going to attack it.
2753320	2755000	No I'd probably start biting at it.
2755000	2758000	And you're an otter.
2759000	2763800	These otters they travel in packs and they and they because they're not rodents.
2763800	2764800	No they're not.
2764800	2767000	How do you know so much about otters?
2767000	2768000	Well we were talking about them today.
2768000	2769000	Where are you visiting?
2769000	2770000	Oh yeah.
2770000	2774280	Were you did you tell me that locusts are just grasshoppers or is that someone else?
2774280	2776000	God no I would never make the mistake.
2776000	2777000	Oh man.
2777000	2778000	No.
2778000	2779000	No.
2779000	2780000	No I'm no a theologist but everybody knows that.
2780000	2781000	Come on.
2781000	2783000	You're not a fish scientist?
2783000	2785000	Because I'm not that either.
2785000	2786000	Oh.
2787000	2792120	But there's a video you could just watch like five otters eat a caiman.
2792120	2793960	They hunt alligator.
2793960	2795840	And they look cute as shit doing it.
2795840	2796840	That's it.
2796840	2797840	That's all.
2797840	2800200	I just imagine them with like headbands on and like little like.
2800200	2801200	Check.
2801200	2805280	Like a bow and arrow that they made out of like a pencil or something.
2805280	2806280	Paperclip rubber band.
2806280	2811120	Well Brian Jakes has taught us that otters use slings.
2811120	2812120	Someone will get that.
2812120	2815640	I don't know if they're here but someone will get that.
2815640	2818880	I think Rhea did make a great point of order though before we move on to the next topic
2818880	2820860	which is that otters have tiny hands.
2820860	2825160	We swam with otters a couple of years ago in San Diego and it's weird because they're
2825160	2827440	little but they've got full hands.
2827440	2828440	Imagine a full hand.
2828440	2829440	Just imagine.
2829440	2830440	They have five fingers?
2830440	2834080	Just imagine a dog walking up to you and then that dog goes like hi.
2834080	2835080	Yeah.
2835080	2839720	You're like oh my god oh my god.
2839720	2844160	With little nails and when they want it they're like oh they're gonna maybe swim inside your
2844160	2845160	bathing suit.
2845680	2849200	But then they have little they get in and you're like oh my god oh they're not.
2849200	2850200	Hands.
2850200	2853840	Like they could go like this and they could go like like like like that.
2853840	2854840	It's opposable.
2854840	2859880	Yeah and I mean honestly as a woman like hands in a bathing suit no problem that like I'm
2859880	2862560	a lesbian it doesn't matter keep going.
2862560	2867960	I'm sorry back up and what?
2867960	2872040	Only because I'm getting so much pleasure because usually I am the person who's awkwardly
2872040	2876120	saying half the thought out things about lesbians.
2876120	2882440	I was making a hands or dicks joke but I didn't get there.
2882440	2886400	I always thought I always thought if I was gonna be an animal I'd be an otter like that
2886400	2891880	would be like because they swim in there when I seen them in Wisconsin they they float on
2891880	2896520	their back and their bellies stick out of the water and they eat like seafood off of
2896520	2897520	their belly.
2898320	2900320	Yeah they just get a nice surf and turf.
2900320	2905880	And it just seems like it seems like the life like when I get in a pool that kind of that's
2905880	2910440	what I end up doing like I don't I don't I'm not one of these people that plays let's splash
2910440	2917000	each other or you get on my shoulders or let's bash our heads on concrete or let's bounce
2917000	2923760	up and down on a slippery fucking spring-loaded piece of weirdly textured sun bleached fiberglass
2923760	2928360	that may or may not at any moment have a different relationship with our weight and
2928360	2933600	result in a fucking neck breakage that would be the most ironic way to die after all you've
2933600	2939640	spent riding otherwise known as diving.
2939640	2944240	The people that jump I just can't but you you probably do it no I don't it's terrifying
2944240	2951000	I jump into a swim yeah you can't swim no no I mean I can survive in a pool most people
2951000	2954720	don't have to survive in a pool most people when they go on vacation they're like this
2954720	2960400	is so great when I'm in a pool I'm like this is so great.
2960400	2964360	Look like an otter yeah I mean it's pretty awesome though yeah I mean I thought I could
2964360	2967720	swim and then we went on vacation and I was in the pool and Cameron was not and then she
2967720	2973080	walked up to the pool I got out of the water and Cameron went oh honey wait what do you
2973080	2977280	you can't swim oh because she just having observed everything you've done in the pool
2977280	2986000	she was like oh I can swim totally no problem and then was like yeah I just like I took
2986000	2990920	a couple solo lap in the pool by myself that was a joke because I took one lap because
2990920	2992680	I can't swim.
2992680	2998600	Is it because because I was a late bloomer swimmer and it was because I didn't I never
2998600	3003120	learned to have my face in the water is that what you're doing so you're dog paddling yeah
3003120	3008320	frantically because the reason everyone else can swim is because they learned that it's
3008320	3013480	okay to have your face in the water I do not yeah if I put my face in the water water goes
3013480	3018200	up my nose which is called dying yep it's called it's called drowning it is a goal to
3018200	3024920	avoid that so you're like you're keeping your hand out of the water yeah and that's called
3024920	3030600	dog paddling yeah yeah it's called survival all right to me a swimming pool is like being
3030600	3035240	in outer space same thing just like being in outer space without a space suit on where
3035240	3040600	I'm just like yeah well it's like you know there's a lot of ways to exercise but almost
3040600	3045480	all of them you have complete access to air yes and swimming is the only one where you
3045480	3054800	have to pick when you get air yeah yeah that's why it's so badass yeah I mean I that's my
3054800	3060120	I was a swimmer in high school do you guys hey what was your um what was your special
3060120	3063760	what did you specialize in oh Ria are you asking what was my specialty I'm asking what
3063760	3075280	was your specialty breaststroke perfect this is from your 1970s lesbian sketch show the
3075280	3080400	two woman Rowan and Martin's laughing what kind of dog do you have ginger does ginger
3080400	3090000	right no ginger snaps and pussy I don't have any I'm proud to say I have no lesbian jokes
3090000	3100200	in my chamber I died there to me they look like jokes about beams of light and I look
3100200	3103360	at them I go why is that funny why is the why do what did one beam of light say to the
3103360	3113920	other and I forget them okay so okay what about these otters though they the thing is
3113920	3119440	when they don't just murder crocodiles when they do it in a process that takes what did
3119440	3123840	it say an hour no no no like four to five four to five it was a long multiple hours
3123840	3128480	they wait they sit on their stomachs and eat them alive yeah and they make sounds that
3128480	3134240	sound like what do you know they had a barbarian royal and goat sounds like the whole time
3134240	3144800	they're like it's like really hours that is spot-on yeah like bone tomahawk all over again wait
3144800	3152080	they sit on people while they're sitting there's a group of them they get together they get it
3152080	3156400	they get a hold of its tail there goes after and then all of a sudden like four of them are on its
3156400	3162000	back spin it over dinosaur belly up that's disgusting oh it's bad yeah it's bad news
3162000	3169200	it's not it's not a joking matter if you're a caiman i mean i i had like eight twelve
3169200	3175280	all the caimans in the audience are going to follow up oh you say a bunch of them get on the
3175280	3184640	other ones belly interesting and then they just keep eating shut up i said to myself my point is
3186880	3190000	dan that's terrifying i'm sorry to know about it

3195040	3201360	girlfriend i mean what is with you you are are you on a space uh there's like a delay no
3202080	3206480	that would mischaracterize you're very on point it's just a call back to the delay from earlier

3349200	3353760	with uh with friends from high school and friends from college all right yeah well we'll get to know
3353760	3359200	the human side of you uh at some other point can i reduce you for a moment to your role as just a
3359200	3366480	uh a person as a representative of a group that yeah i was so stark raving drunk uh
3367200	3372240	last time we spoke which was on stage in chicago all right new york yeah yeah see there you go
3373120	3379840	i transitioned geographically i i i i i i i i i like all i remember is the last time we checked
3379840	3385440	in was that you had said like it was a it was like that you had escaped dichotomy all together
3385440	3388960	that it was like you were you were kind of like like oh there was a transition but then it was
3388960	3392880	like like like that's kind of like there was a third act there where you were like i'm just jane
3392880	3399360	like i'm not uh right yeah so you're right that the journey had begun that i thought i was going
3399360	3404640	from glenn to jane and that it was going to be male to female and that's where i had thought i
3404640	3408240	was going to go if you would have asked me like 30 years ago when i was in college that it was like
3408240	3414560	yeah we talked about the my my ideal then was back to madonna that you know i'm gonna i i i want to
3414560	3421600	go all the way um but in the in the years since it's uh i don't know i've changed i i'm comfortable
3421600	3427920	sort of landing sort of well a lot of it has to do so i have a son who is agendered who has come
3427920	3435680	out as agendered he's 19 years old oh and it's learning about just with language and with with
3435680	3441120	with experience and with with culture subcultures that are accepting of these in between states
3441920	3448000	i'm finding out that oh this this dichotomy that i was i thought that i had to exist on one side of
3448000	3453920	the other of there are these in-betweens and so i'm sort of learning as i go that i have other
3453920	3462160	options like and among them being like unlabelable options well yeah i mean all the terms that are
3462160	3467840	coming up you know the non non-binary gen nbg i mean all the acronyms and abbreviations and
3467840	3472880	everything that are coming up from yeah that there are things that are just what what's gender anyway
3472880	3479040	type of type of questions who am i doing this for what who am i trying to impress who am i changing
3479120	3487440	for and it it it puts me i've sort of put myself into this soup of options and i don't know and i'm
3487440	3494800	actually feeling pretty good about not knowing i think i think certainty is uh the enemy we have
3494800	3502720	found in comedy politics uh and uh now this uh but i already knew that what did you what
3502720	3507520	took you so long to catch up opportunity opportunity is is is the thing i mean that
3507520	3512960	that's that's the brilliance is how do you mean you have the freedom to explore right which
3514000	3519280	yeah opportunity gets eliminated by certitude yes fucking nailed it
3521760	3527520	like it's like we worship certainty in our culture uh well i i thought it was a weird i
3527520	3532800	tweet i tweeted this thing i wasn't it was not an original thought i was retweeting some
3532800	3539360	dude that was like a pundit who said it's a pretty simple statement but i was a i was amazed
3539360	3546480	at the amount of retweets of my retweet it was that this guy they had a little thing on cnn where
3546480	3551200	they just talked about the state of the media and and you know is the media is the media responsible
3551200	3560560	for our dichotomous kind of like weird hyper partisan uh uh psychosis uh or or is it is the
3560560	3567120	media just faithfully covering what is just a weirdly uh hyper partisan psyche i guess you can
3567120	3573520	hear from my tone what i think is the case uh but but but this one guy john avlon from i think daily
3573520	3579280	beasts said americans are no longer assuming goodwill on part of the folks they disagree with
3579280	3584720	and i was i was kind of blown away with the amount of people that were retweeting that i guess uh
3584720	3590000	tying that into what you're talking about it's like it it we are being trained we're being
3590000	3595520	socialized to be certain of things and part of being certain is you have to defend you have to
3595520	3602480	like compartmentalize if you're certain that a a glass of water is poison and someone walks up to
3602480	3608080	it and starts to drink it it's your duty as a human being actually is a person who values the
3608080	3613200	human race and who hopes that we survive to see a better day and colonize various planets and
3613200	3620400	outlived giraffes let's fucking things oh i'm a horse i should have a longer neck don't let them
3620400	3630240	win do you want to live in a world where that's how you win we're getting close man as of trump
3630240	3636080	we're like a close like like like like just the drop off between us and giraffes got a little less
3637040	3642480	uh because i bet the smartest giraffe is like like like like we like if you really had the
3642480	3647760	option of voting for them anyways uh i want to thank you for that i don't know if you know my
3647760	3653520	son and i actually put together a compilation of every time that you said giraffe in the first 150
3653520	3662160	episodes of harmontown and it is six minutes long and it is on youtube and i encourage you to find
3662160	3665280	it because it's fucking hilarious because in biology that's the first thing we learn when
3665360	3669760	they're teaching us about darwinism they use the obvious example of the giraffe i think you've
3669760	3675680	talked about giraffes more than you've talked about race on this show i mean what's the difference
3677120	3681040	we're talking about necks of different lengths um
3687200	3688560	why am i looking at this what was your point
3688560	3696640	i'm just hiding you know certitude i think one thing that i just want to point out is that
3697360	3703760	number one dan cheers love this uh advocacy and i think it's awesome i also patronize me no
3704640	3708320	no go fuck yourself you're about to follow that up with a butt you're like you're literally you
3708320	3714480	fucking fat piece of shit no i think it exists um i think what's confusing about right now is
3714480	3719840	that that is a great way to think it's maybe the best way to think and then it also exists
3719840	3724800	in the same time when being a minority group means that you have to really fight for space
3724800	3729680	and so that is what's happening right now that's very confusing because to be in a minority group
3729680	3732880	you have to be very certain about who you are in order to just have some boundaries
3732880	3738080	around yourself and that i think is why it's so scary to exist right now and be in a minority
3738080	3743520	group is because like i i don't believe that there is certainty in the world i mean that
3743520	3748240	this this is such a i joke about my haircut in like this very surface level but when i got this
3748240	3752560	haircut it was like the first time that i felt like i really understood what was going on with
3752560	3758560	me because it really is like habsies and that felt great and uh it continues to feel great and whoops
3758560	3763280	today's circuit's gonna last for like it's just a real problem at this point can't get rid of it
3763920	3768560	going it's a like asymmetrical haircuts or a thing of the past everybody's got a blunt bob
3769200	3775280	fucking sorry about it um how much of it okay just to interject not to derail yeah how much of
3775280	3780000	that when you talk about that like like uh any move you made with your hair how much of it is
3780000	3785120	inside and how much of it is outside like like that the as far as like oh if i if i got a all
3785120	3789040	short it would cause a shit story about how much of that is in i don't know that we can decide right
3789040	3793520	right i guess that's what i'm saying is that like because you're a performer indicates but not just
3793520	3797760	that it's not the performer thing it's like this indicates something to the world about who i see
3797760	3801760	myself and then this indicates something to the world and so i think like that's the time that
3801760	3805600	we're living and we're living in this time when like you have to carve out who you are and be
3805600	3812080	really specific about what you're saying right but we also are fluid people and we are complicated
3812080	3816240	and our world is complicated and we shouldn't have to defend one thing forever for the rest of our
3816240	3820880	lives so it's we're in a weird moment right now you're in the you're in this point where you have
3820880	3825280	this you have you're it's sort of your personal culture you have your self identity but you have
3825360	3830880	to exist within the contents context of a society and society is about boundaries society is about
3830880	3835280	comfort it's about it's about opportunities but it's also about uh boundary conditions
3836240	3842960	and i can't just say to to the the topic du jour what bathroom i'm going to use
3843840	3848640	i can't go in and just immediately demand that there's either a third option hey don't use my
3849120	3855120	i'm saying after i've been in there i just i've got my en suite i don't have to i have to do a
3855120	3859200	punch line of every 30 seconds i know i know i've got a trans bathroom it's okay back to what you're
3859200	3866000	saying but but to your point karen i mean it's really it is unsafe it's very scary it's scary
3866000	3871680	for me it's scary for for me as a parent for my son it's very it's perfect for my other son who
3871680	3876800	is straight and cis but is a strong advocate for his little brother and for his for his father
3876880	3882400	yeah i've thought well i would i would imagine yeah i i i'm gonna start babbling and hope that
3882400	3888480	somewhere along the line i'll be adding instead of just babbling but uh go it seems it seems to be
3888480	3892480	that the american dream is moving from it's like like we had a definition for it and we're just
3892480	3897280	slowly moving into this place of genuine like egalitarian kind of like i don't know it's like
3897280	3904640	like like a sort of pragmatic view of what the original framers of that concept um said but
3904640	3911040	weren't actually thinking and it's like we're trying to create a honeycomb where within each
3911040	3920000	perfect hexagonal fucking comb uh which represents your right to not be mugged beaten terrorized
3920000	3928240	threatened uh shouted down respect blah blah blah uh but within that perfect honeycomb that exists
3928320	3933440	in this ginormous uh hive that we do rely on and fear being excommunicated
3935360	3944080	foster brooks um that within that we we have to start thinking of ourselves as as like a gelatinous
3944080	3952400	like organic ooze and and and stop bothering to go well i happen to live in this hexagonal
3952400	3960320	compartment uh that's actually perfect because as it turns out i'm hexagonal it's like no you're a
3960320	3967600	you're you're as much humanity as can be poured into uh that little cell and and and like your
3967600	3973520	liquid and if you were to for instance meet a partner that you and you wanted to merge with
3973520	3977520	them you could eliminate a wall and that's where the metaphor starts to break down but it's like
3977520	3981920	that that we kind of like exist within there and it's like we want to desperately kind of we all
3981920	3987040	want to live in this world where it's just like oh shit can we we like what if what if the
3987040	3993360	conversations we had had anything to do we're on the next level that weren't about like what
3993360	3998640	does your hair feel like and is that weird how's the weather up there i like like like oh peter
3998640	4002560	dinklage are you a great actor are you just the greatest actor of that height like like just
4003680	4009840	just just fascination with each other's bodies and their cheekbones and pigmentation and private
4009840	4015200	parts and behavior in the bedroom and when we fart and how we fart and how we describe a fart
4015200	4020240	and how we do it and whether or not a one syllable word for a japanese person is more or less
4020240	4026160	offensive than a multi-syllabic crazy chain of syllables uh that ultimately mean i'm just saying
4026160	4030400	this so i don't get in trouble i was like wait we're just we're just we're just terrified and
4030400	4037280	fascinated with all these surface things but i we all want to be liquid we want to be but we
4037280	4043840	don't believe it's possible because we're afraid we'll i think we're afraid we'll we'll we'll run
4043840	4049520	together and we'll we'll we'll we'll stop being we'll be skynet like we're and and the computer
4049520	4055280	will be like oh i was gonna do that but fuck it like skynet i'll be like oh shit i was gearing
4055280	4062720	up to nuke you guys but you just uh uh uh evolved to the point where nobody no nothing was funny
4062720	4067280	because you were all hanging out well you that's what we're afraid that's what i think that's the
4067280	4073920	way the white straight rage like that that's that's where our our fear i think i'll speak for them
4073920	4078960	and say i think the fear is our toys are going to get taken away and everything that was special
4078960	4084640	is going to stop being special and i think it would be a mistake to look at that simply as
4084640	4090480	one privileged group happens to have that i think i think anyone would have that in the
4090480	4097760	state of privilege what the fuck is going on it's my show no we're riveted no more lesbians
4097760	4102400	no more trans people can i can i ask you a question about the retreats i control this
4102400	4109360	show i'm trying to talk about how i'm an advocate dan you people are fucking it up no i think i
4109360	4114960	think what you're talking about is uh talking about how i'm a good smart person you're wonderful
4115200	4117440	i think what you're wrong about me
4119680	4124480	i think what you're talking about is the very real feeling of when you have 100 of the things
4124480	4128160	and then you lose some of that stuff and then that becomes a real feeling of loss it feels
4128160	4132720	like an amputation because you used to have 100 of the things and i think what i'm talking about
4132720	4136640	is this brand new feeling of liberty that is happening yeah doesn't happen it doesn't exist
4136640	4142000	for everybody yet but it's more now than it used to be my lovely wife we're moving tomorrow to a new
4142000	4147120	apartment and last night she said to me in the second to last night an apartment that we have
4147120	4152560	lived in our first place in l.a she said to me uh there's a way in which we're first generation
4152560	4158080	americans um and that's true because we are the first generation that will have gotten married
4158080	4163280	legally um like young you know we got to get married legally young so this is a weird fucking
4163280	4172640	time to live and i have nothing to write about and stand up it's so terrible i was i was trying
4172640	4176720	to like there's a there's a like i go to these stupid like branded entertainment conferences
4176720	4180640	where we talk about like oh could jiff peanut butter make breaking bad you know instead of
4180640	4188080	paramount and uh and it's like the answer is no because uh if a peanut butter company makes
4188080	4192560	breaking bad and it fails which it will 90 percent of the time believe me this is connected give me a
4192560	4198480	chance um and let me pronounce chance like a french person um the uh the the the someone will
4198480	4203040	get fired at the peanut butter company but on the other side of it writers have to overcome their
4203040	4210000	addiction to just thinking that what you couldn't say 10 years ago now automatically qualifies as
4210000	4215920	edgy progressive and stuff i am so guilty like all of my friends i like like that's what we do
4215920	4221040	like we push buttons like what like in this new world where everybody actually does respect each
4221040	4226880	other part of the i think the fear is among creatives particularly comedic ones i think
4226880	4230960	there's like an unconscious fear of like well what's going to be funny if everybody gets along
4232240	4236800	like if nothing's wrong that's what to say not that not that we're all envisioning a future
4236800	4241360	where no one's ever having conflict but it's like it's more about like oh like you know what you
4241360	4245760	never see in rod and berry's original star trek series they never go to a stand-up club like like
4246480	4250400	you see you you you you get a hint of how shitty music gets
4253360	4256880	because because spock is the only musician on the enterprise
4258560	4266400	and he plays a fucking like rush instrument like he's like i love rush and 3d chess um you
4267600	4272160	you but what you they never go to a comedy club and like like like like like what would
4272160	4278720	what would rod and berry and stand-up be the answer is it wouldn't obviously it wouldn't
4278720	4285200	have to do with klingon's drive like this and romulan's drive like that it would it would it
4285200	4289040	would be like oh there would be there's like something funny i think that's the big panic
4289040	4294000	i think that's the big there's a big fundamental question in comedy which is like uh are we just
4294000	4301200	gonna pat ourselves on the back for not hating each other and and take a 10 um skim off the top
4301200	4307840	of our pursuit of maximum comedy that i i i like like like are we gonna are we gonna like step
4307840	4314560	things down one gear for the sake of fashion and say oh i'm i'm cool with everybody and that's how
4314560	4321200	you don't get booed off stage in in in exchange for that i'm not gonna make you clutch your sides
4321200	4325840	that's the that's the i think that's the underlying fear is that we would do that but i think we've
4325840	4332000	already done it so seinfeld is about how other people are idiots because they serve you bad
4332000	4337840	airplane food or they are like massage therapists but they don't rub your body enough or whatever
4337840	4342080	she's a wrong rubber yeah she rubs you wrong
4346000	4353600	and louie and maren and uh i would say this current experience we're having right here
4353840	4359040	comedy is about how we are idiots no it used to be about other people right it's about how we are
4359040	4364480	idiots um and so that's one direction that it's going to go in that already has gone in and hey
4364480	4369120	i can think i'm an idiot for a while so i'm trying to crack i'm trying to crack that safe
4369120	4376640	because i my first like 15 years doing this job was just like respect me please and then thank
4376640	4384480	god i'm still a woman right because yeah i mean give me a minute you got tenure yeah you're you're
4384480	4392720	gonna die reaching you better believe it if history's any teacher i mean we'll we'll have
4392720	4397840	an octopus president before oh okay at least that octopus is honest you know
4397840	4408000	i just i just don't i just like it is you know she's a woman it's just like what are you even
4408000	4415040	talking about i just hear i'm a hillary supporter that's a whole joke yeah just want to make that
4415040	4422000	clear is there i dare dare dare i dare i poke into this uh or do you guys share that or are you one
4422000	4427280	of these wives that just votes oh no we're both super into hillary clinton the other night i was
4427760	4432240	i was like man i'm really glad we're like both into hillary and both the same amount because
4432240	4438160	this would be very difficult if it weren't i i i find that uh she's very inspiring because she has
4438160	4442480	been committed to her job for such a long time and committed politician and i also find
4442480	4447440	that it's like very convenient that she's the only politician that we call a liar all the time
4447440	4452320	wonder what that is because it feels like all politicians are kind of sacks of shit
4453200	4461840	so why would she i wonder if there's anything about her that would make people so mad because
4461840	4468560	it's like she's like has access to money which is so weird for a politician to have like money
4468560	4473600	around them because it's like every other former president is just like living in poverty because
4473600	4479040	they don't take any money for speaking engagements and it's really weird that she does and i just feel
4479040	4484480	like she's kind of like owned by a lot of people in a way that just nobody has ever been owned by
4484480	4490240	anybody certainly not like george washington certainly not like other presidents who actually
4490240	4498320	owned other people that happened for a fucking while those people are on our money i wonder
4498320	4503680	what's different about those dudes with ponytails on her money and this woman who doesn't have a
4503680	4514160	ponytail i wonder if there's anything that we can think of again i fucking love it i uh and i
4514160	4519840	and i want to i'm gonna for my own sake set up road flares because i'm no i'm not informed at
4519840	4525840	all i think it's awesome that you guys are like like i i i i because it seems like a shoe in now
4525840	4530000	i think that the media is now engaged in the business of convincing us it's going to be a
4530000	4536240	squeaker but it seems to me that aside from people saying well no one could have predicted
4536240	4541520	everything else that's happened are the only people that are saying like oh uh anything other
4541520	4547520	than hillary winning i hope i'm not uh putting my thumb on any political scale by predicting that
4547520	4551360	that's just going to be the thing it just seems like that's going to be the thing and i've been
4551360	4556800	kind of careful for different reasons in the past i've like i've been just a jaded asshole and said
4556800	4561680	politics don't matter because the bipartisan system is full of shit in the past this election
4561680	4568480	i'm like specifically keeping my hands off out of social terror in a healthy way because i don't
4568480	4574560	want to i sense that because to the extent that the office of the president is important
4574560	4580240	it's like i don't want to get in an argument with anybody that would be that stoked about simply for
4580240	4586400	the first time in all this time a woman uh being behind that desk at any cost or anything i also
4586400	4590320	definitely don't want to be a person that waves that flag in the face of someone who's stoked
4590320	4596560	that this awesome fucking socialist crypt keeper is like fucking like like like he's he's amazing
4596560	4600720	too he's like fucking he's kind of he seems like a stand-up guy and is like saying shit that a
4600720	4605200	politician should stay i he seems like a fan of drones and so does she and oh but they're
4605200	4612160	politicians i uh but i the one thing that i that did make me kind of like i was like oh wait okay
4612160	4618800	i can be i can be i can be into a hillary uh uh thing it was the fact that i just watching
4618800	4623760	what's happened over the last five months is like oh shit all of this goes back to us voting for a
4623760	4628800	black guy eight years ago it's totally true the bipartisan system is collapsing because we elected
4628800	4636560	a black guy let's elect a woman and see what how much further we can do worse for women i don't
4636560	4641440	know if you remember anything called black lives matter but that was particularly tipped off by
4641440	4645760	somebody named rock obama having some power and so then everybody was like we're really mad
4645760	4653040	i'm all these black people so republicans got so mad that we don't know what's happening where are
4653040	4658960	i mean even the the democrats are mad because if you think back to the 2008 primary in west
4658960	4666560	virginia west virginia went for hillary clinton in 2008 and then just in 2006 in 2016 bernie
4666560	4672480	sanders i'm out of my so what does that mean i don't know i don't know you're talking about
4672480	4677520	well you're not what does delegate mean i don't know i start with the basics what is a vote how
4677520	4683440	does that work you know super delegates dan is florida the one shaped like a like a shoe i don't
4683440	4688240	no it's shaped like a dick you should know it yeah yeah no i don't i'm too focused on my own
4688240	4694720	dick shaped dick i i'm like why aren't you more florida shaped why do you look like uh
4694800	4701840	fucking like road island job oh that way okay i ended oh because it's a small estate you fucking
4701840	4704320	asshole
4706480	4710800	i was actually thinking of my actual dick shape take that home with you
4712560	4716320	i wasn't going with size for that i was like why are you like a fucking like
4716960	4727120	like just a just a sliver of territory on a loaded overfunded hairy continent
4728240	4734560	you know dan i just feel like it's important to say because i can tell how uncomfortable this
4734560	4744160	audience is uh that you know i i i think that uh all right well how about this fiscal the stuff
4744160	4749120	you're saying about bernie sanders that he would change um our financial system in this country
4749120	4753360	wait when did i say that or you're saying that he's saying stuff the politicians should say about
4753360	4759360	money i no dude okay listen that you said all right so i thought like like like let's let's
4759360	4766080	let's let's really lay out an accurate landscape i i know 10 minutes worth of information about
4766080	4772240	every single candidate in totality each and like most of us i know an unfortunate amount about
4772240	4776880	donald trump because that's all we talk about and all we're fascinated with and then i have these
4776880	4781760	slivers of things that i kind of just pick up culturally from my friends and i don't know
4781760	4786880	please don't make the mistake of thinking that i would it's my my objective this time around i'm
4786880	4792400	gonna vote my conscience and and there's no there's no reason for me to lie about it i well i i well
4792400	4796960	i'm gonna i i think it's gonna be a choice between the fucking republican and democrat the democrat's
4796960	4802960	gonna be hillary right i if that's the case i'll vote for her i'm not gonna enact some weird
4802960	4807760	rebellion although i don't think anyone's a bad person for doing that uh just to weave in our
4807760	4812480	lesson uncertainty is the enemy i think i think i think one of the big problems with with with
4812480	4817760	with our system i think the reason it's become the way it is is because we we've we're so successful
4817760	4824160	as a nation that we we it voting is just sort of like this gravy it's not like it doesn't as much
4824160	4828560	as we feel it's important or like like it's not the same as in a third world country where it's
4828560	4834720	like one guy works for nike and the other guy grew up down the street from me and oh he got
4834720	4841120	assassinated nike it is um it's like like the election is never the stakes aren't that high
4841120	4846320	in an empire where it's just and so we've sophisticated the process and it's gotten to
4846320	4852960	the point where we spend two years before the elections treating the elections like a reality
4852960	4857520	show including everyone talking about who you're going to vote for who you're going to vote for
4857520	4864640	and a lot like praying like it kind of removes the the important part of of what voting is when
4864640	4869600	you're when you're kind of doing it publicly and thinking about it as a team versus a team and
4869600	4875360	what's what inevitably happens is that oh well it's always going to turn into two giant fucking
4875360	4880720	blobs shouting at each other and and the real victims are the people who would otherwise just
4880720	4888960	go that's cool but i like i feel this way and like for those people i feel the political
4888960	4894560	tragedy in the united states is that those people are told invariably uh what you're doing right now
4894560	4899440	whether it's not giving a shit or giving a shit about the wrong thing is equal to giving a shit
4899440	4906560	about donald trump because because if she were to delegate me he retakes ontario then Ontario
4906560	4911840	could take this casual bond that would be amazing yeah i mean i think i think you're right about
4911840	4918960	so much of what you're saying and i i just would say that i think as i really people uh as a woman
4918960	4924240	it would mean so much to me to have a female president and i also like her this i but i i
4924240	4928400	also feel that it is very offensive when people say that you cannot vote for someone because
4928400	4931760	they're a woman because that doesn't make me a single issue voter because i'm a woman on every
4931760	4936480	single issue and i really think that right now we're living in a very scary time for women
4936560	4943600	um this last week Oklahoma possibly making abortion a felony like we will never be equal
4943600	4947680	in a country where abortion rights can possibly be taken away and there's so much at stake right
4947680	4952000	now for women in terms of economic justice in terms of reproductive justice and we're living
4952000	4957040	at like this real crossroads and but you know for every action there's an opposite reaction if
4957040	4961920	you're feeling that offense the insinuation that the only reason you're voting is for this or that
4961920	4965520	you can imagine the the force you're pushing up against which is somebody who's saying
4965520	4969440	jesus christ i've never felt more shamed in my life for being a woman than the day that i decided
4969440	4972720	to vote for somebody based on whether or not they were gonna make it good i was like like like
4972720	4977840	that's that's why that's another reason why i feel like really really loathe to bring my
4977840	4984240	weird heisenbergian penis into the whole fucking thing because it just doesn't matter to me way
4984240	4989440	more than it it's like it should matter more to i don't even want to fucking get involved i feel
4989440	4994880	like a weird tom cruz character coming into the fray i'm something explaining to someone no matter
4994880	4999440	what i'm saying that's that's amazing well you know what cheers then i just that's how you feel
4999440	5004560	then cool i kind of felt like then you've achieved because it should be important to you that a woman
5004560	5008240	gets elected and i don't want to like i wouldn't want it's like like i could i could we're living
5008240	5013600	in a time right now and this is a great thing where two equally intelligent women could be standing
5013600	5019920	in a bar that i and i could like them both equally and they could they could be fucking like really
5019920	5025600	mad at each other right now like like like they're and saying fucked up things like insinuating that
5025600	5031600	that they that they don't think about their vote the right way and it's like for me to come in and
5031600	5036400	like i just i'm like i'm not going to make this situation better and i was like it's ultimately
5036400	5042480	going to come down to uh pepsi versus coke and i fucking it's it's you know like like i i can take
5042480	5050320	this one out it's only four years uh i i i what i'm trying to say is that i recognize like i i
5050320	5055600	definitely don't uh don't mistake me for a person that's like uh don't mistake me for the kind of
5055600	5066080	person you wouldn't like oh i did it there's a trans lady with a key to my house i think don't
5066160	5071280	and i respect your right to vote for who you're going to vote for i'm mr schmoo
5072720	5077760	no don't don't mistake me for a person you wouldn't like is the rallying cry of the comic
5078400	5084880	that's our whole thing are you laughing now at the things i'm saying how about the tweets i'm
5084880	5088880	saying out of my twitter phone but don't you that's my honest position i that's the most
5088880	5094160	honest i could get is like i honestly just want people to like me and i honestly don't care about
5094160	5100800	health care right now or and i don't have a skin in the game of of women's reproductive rights
5100800	5104720	i i i i can tell you where i stand if somebody asked me to fucking back up the team i have very
5104720	5113600	little skin in that game too uh i mean it's not like ria has never mind what i was just gonna say
5113600	5118800	like never mind the most honest position for me to take right now is to say like i don't i'm fucking
5118800	5123600	under informed and i just want people to like me and i and i want my friends to not hate each other
5124560	5130400	especially my chick friends because they're all so cool well you know i would say that i can sense
5130400	5135600	the discomfort from the audience and i would just i palatable that is the thing that feels weird to
5135600	5139120	me well is that people are uncomfortable talking about this stuff because i actually think that's
5139120	5143520	our boundary well if we can't talk about how it feels to be on either side then we're lost
5143520	5147200	yeah that's that's when people solidify their issues is when nobody can talk when people have
5147200	5152240	to resort to name calling i love the conversation we're having and i'm not again like cheers to
5152240	5155600	whatever's happening for you and whatever emotional journey you're going on i know you
5155600	5162320	thought this was a comedy show i'm so sorry oh god no no no but i really feel like we should
5162320	5165600	be modeling through this like this is stuff we should be talking about we should be talking about
5165600	5168960	the fact that like we have had a black president for the first time and what did that mean and we
5168960	5172000	should talk about the fact that this woman is running and what does that mean and we should
5172000	5176800	be talking about all of these issues like conversation is what is what we need like
5176800	5180640	that's the answer to everything that's the answer to being human being i feel a need to say for the
5180640	5187280	other side of that issue that well yeah but then there's the whole draw a wall between
5187280	5193120	that and the point of view like yeah but that's boring like i said it's like like like because
5193120	5198640	what i would i'm gonna project onto them a tremendous amount of whether they're hillary
5198640	5206000	or bernie supporters and and and hats off to a kyle our trump supporter uh in the back
5206880	5216240	uh this podcast is huge it's huge um the you're out there the the um i i i i project onto them a
5216240	5224880	a a dan harmonish kind of like overriding thing of like yeah but if we start like if we really
5224880	5231280	it's it's like hard to escape that gravity of that thing where yeah i honestly honest to god
5231280	5238000	like like like just in the like your passion for for hillary as a candidate there was like like
5238000	5244720	everyone loves and i i'm to speak for myself i respect and love you love you weird we love each
5244720	5255600	other hey i respect i respect i respect i respect i want you to like me and i like you and i i i want
5255600	5260640	to reward you for your honesty and encourage your i'd never want to punish you or anything like
5260640	5267440	that so i'm i'm using that overriding principle and when you like i so i can sense that that like
5267440	5272800	the hillary thing like there's shit on the line for you and i can sense your joy and your glee
5272800	5279680	and part of what comes with that meal is just a little fucking chutney of like fucking spite
5279680	5283600	like like and and and if i just focus on that and go what the fuck is this
5283600	5290480	did you just fucking imply that i don't fuck up with the book it's like like i don't want that's
5290480	5295440	what to me what a political conversation kind of is is we like yeah it's we all focus on chutney
5295440	5296960	it's the gray alien in your bed
5303760	5308720	you but you you were gonna say that no matter what i said yeah you had that locked and loaded
5308720	5316160	was i was i didn't hey heath do you enjoy directing great minds oh god i i enjoy directing
5316160	5324320	great minds more than i love sitting up here as a heteronormative cisgendered male hearing about
5324320	5329280	that oh my god live in that no i'll live in it i'll say and i will say i would happily vote for
5329280	5336080	elizabeth warren oh no like seriously go fuck yourself on that we don't even want to open that
5336480	5342000	i don't you're exactly right nor can i yeah and but i will say that has nothing to do with
5342000	5346160	hillary's gender that i don't oh my god if it didn't have anything to do with hillary's gender
5346160	5352400	you wouldn't say elizabeth warren no no i would i'm normalizing that as the variable i have so much
5354160	5359280	anyway do you notice that i'm gonna vote for i'm gonna vote for sweating you're sweating so hard
5359280	5364720	all over you great minds great minds all of us tell us about this show it's wonderful now
5365360	5369360	you're just i'm now you're just where's the way i can sled the knife in like where's the
5369360	5374080	chink in the air no i don't want to murder you no i would like to metaphorically metaphorically
5374080	5379440	and make you all vote for i'm gonna vote for i'm gonna vote for look what i did i changed you did
5379440	5386160	you did with sadness and earnestness um look we're all gonna vote for yeah we're gonna have to
5386160	5392640	we're gonna have to but just just for a minute taking a minute to just acknowledge the fact
5392640	5399680	that i maybe just shamed you into that and like that's beautiful too congratulations like as a
5399680	5407280	woman that's so beautiful all the way power i feel like i gotta yeah i got you to like some
5407280	5413760	stuff has been second hand i got you to open that button up you're welcome yeah as a cis gendered
5413760	5426960	straight male um how much is that uh i do want to know i want to look back at your read i'll talk
5426960	5431760	about great minds in a second but i do want to look at your retweets because the great irony of
5431760	5436800	this whole thing on the quote of everybody should be nice and just talk about the issue is like you
5436800	5441600	got a retreat by rush limbaugh and donald trump and like these horrible people they're like yes
5441600	5446240	we should be nice meanwhile they're popping vicodin and like screaming about shouting people
5446240	5450240	down you use the pronoun you and i don't know what what do you know the retweet i mean i just
5450240	5455520	want to look at the list of retweets you got on your well i was kind of amazed it was like well
5456320	5460480	sure some of them are since solid ones in 24 hours what was about a chorus line the movie
5460480	5466160	and uh i was present yeah for your glee but i just i think that i just mean the irony in
5467040	5472480	among the apatow or whoever retweeted the the the progressive-minded people you would expect to
5472480	5477680	retweet let's disagree about the thing at hand and be nice to each other while we do it
5477680	5484240	also total dick faces like trump and rush limbaugh also retweeted it like yeah we should do that
5485280	5490400	that's why i'm losing you i don't uh but the the tweet that i retweeted was a guy saying uh
5490960	5495760	he was it was a correspondent or whatever you call him a pundit just saying like oh we've
5495760	5500560	lost yes i go okay right and then you have an asshole who is the capacity to entertain
5500560	5505520	the humanity of a person that disagrees with us that's me paraphrasing yes did you are you
5505520	5510800	being literal did rush limbaugh read no i'm saying i would be interested to look at who retweeted
5510800	5518240	your thing and say oh and look who said it hitler all right you know well yes from the past he has
5518240	5522880	a twitter feed well like um like like everyone would agree hitler and jesus would both agree
5522880	5528800	uh uh do unto others you know it's like some things are so true like like i couldn't agree
5528800	5538080	more but i think we all know what hitler would do to jesus hitler too soon too soon historically
5538080	5548800	right too soon listen i'm trying to give you jokes are they extremely contentious jokes
5549760	5558960	yes they are but but jesus was also murdered that's one of the main facts about jesus if you
5558960	5563600	just figured out now that jesus might have been murdered you missed the whole point of jesus
5564960	5570240	spoiler alert he dies yeah yeah that guy did not make it there was a rabbit that rolled the rock
5570240	5575680	away and that's what we celebrate eastern and he got out and it was shaped like an egg it was shaped
5575760	5583840	like yeah it's an egg shape oh my god yeah yeah and then the east islands um great minds is what
5583840	5589200	do they call that a murderer's row of of is that right when you say like you have a great oh god
5589200	5593600	so great minds is uh please talk to us about this show you guys have just made it i've seen
5593600	5598720	the instagram tonight yeah we just wrapped congratulations it was wonderful yeah
5598720	5606240	is that the phrase just like a murderer's row and it's like when it's a hit list of awesome
5606240	5610800	people or something right yeah okay so it was a murderer's row of i think it originated with a
5610800	5616480	row of people who were good at murdering other people but you know like like not in cells they
5616480	5621120	were just there was just lined up just like murderers like to stand next to each other i
5621120	5626480	don't know if you know this yeah it's just i'm imagining like a bench at a basketball game
5626480	5630240	but it's just murder and it's like do you think murderers like to stand next to each other
5630240	5635040	because they can tell who else is a murderer or do you think there's a crazy thing that
5635040	5641280	where murderers have evolved to project a non-murderest uh pheromone so all murderers
5641280	5647040	chained together like uh they have a hydrophobic head and a hydrophilic tail like like so they so
5647040	5650960	they naturally chained together as like an amino acid that makes sense perfect that's what i'm
5650960	5655840	talking about no science on the weekends that's what i always do are the murderers always like
5655840	5660480	just recognizing the murder behind you and you think it's talking to you oh yeah it's the murder
5660480	5665520	behind me yeah it's so embarrassing where the hell did you pull that out of your what
5665520	5671120	hydrophilic hydrophobic hydrophobic that's on the tape of his tongue i sell membranes it's not
5671120	5677200	exactly rocket science don't don't take they're impressed with me for one second people are
5677200	5682720	impressed with me i know and she's a science person so just no i wasn't impressed i was surprised
5683120	5688640	all right fine one and you're like that's not a surprise it's like a squirrel trap
5688640	5695760	tool there phospholipid membrane embedded with proteins i love you and that's why i poked your
5695760	5705440	belly this is great uh yeah i got the key to his house okay uh small talk small talk go
5705440	5716880	nice weather no no no uh what small talk like okay so like like i'm really bad at uh at just
5716880	5722880	interacting with people like uh like just it's not we mischaracterize it as small talk like we
5722880	5728480	have this thing where we go like oh there's small talk where you say these no one ever has a small
5728480	5731760	talk conversation where you go oh it's nice weather yeah there's weather and all this stuff
5731840	5735760	like everyone is always trying as hard as they can to kind of connect it's just i think like
5735760	5741760	some people like like sometimes sometimes you're just trying to like get away that's true yeah
5741760	5746160	well it's like you're biding your time until it's politically possible to get away smoothly
5746160	5750880	i'm always trying to do that when i sense that i'm not going to be good in the conversation like
5753600	5758640	do you regularly have conversations with people who you can sense are actually doing everything
5758640	5764160	on paper right like they're they're being effusive they're being complementary they're
5764160	5768320	they're they're they're they're they're being open they're saying like i don't know they're
5768320	5773680	kind of technically saying things that are like like oh i like your jacket i like your and that's
5773680	5779600	a not to not to make it like all superficial it's like they could it's like like are you
5779600	5783920	often finding yourself going like yeah but i don't that doesn't set me up to say anything except for
5783920	5788480	yes or no and i feel weird like i have a script and i don't i fucking hate this i want it doesn't
5788480	5793440	happen often but i mean i've like built my career around avoiding those sorts of situations
5793440	5797440	how do you do it you refuse great opportunities sometimes
5799600	5805680	so that you have a career that has some integrity hey jane jane vaguely what do you what what field
5805680	5811600	are you in just vaguely i'm a research scientist oh great hey so i feel like you could avoid social
5811600	5818800	interaction for a while i i i spent a lot of years avoiding positions of like managerial
5818800	5828160	responsibility or if i go to some sort of a like like an event big quotes um just stand around
5828160	5832720	being looking really uncomfortable which is very easy like hang around in the corner if someone
5832720	5838880	approaches you quickly go into a jargon filled explanation of something so that they then feel
5838880	5843360	uncomfortable and leave you alone i have a lot of values that's that's a great way of dealing
5843360	5848160	with that i love that option i should i should have paid attention no that's okay don't worry
5848160	5853040	about it i got this side you get that side but your side got the great way of dealing with
5853040	5858960	something yeah god damn it well dan are you sitting over here with the baseball person are you an
5858960	5865360	introvert are you an introvert or an extrovert dan harmon i don't think i don't see the world through
5865360	5870560	that dichotomy that's more practice certainty well first of all i love that that got a round of
5870560	5875680	applause from like four people just like that was what was really oppressing them they like callbacks
5875680	5880320	yeah they don't they don't like politics they like callbacks i also like thinking about a
5880320	5885840	population of people that are like their main oppressive boxes are introvert and extrovert
5885840	5890480	that you just like you like just hit on them like they're just like oh we give a fuck about this
5890640	5897200	hillary clinton shit like race next transgender shit don't give a fuck about it introvert extrovert
5897200	5903520	yeah myers bricks text yes yes you hate the myers bricks yes because because because because you
5903520	5908720	would prefer a bathroom that didn't have urinals then uh yes i would like there to not be your
5908720	5913840	that is awesome i think that's a weird thing to do to people to make that's a very extroverted
5913840	5919280	or everything we should define we should we should poop next to each other we should like high five
5919360	5925360	we're pooping or we should get this pee thing separated well yeah i so let's talk about growing
5925360	5929360	up in los angeles one of the things i remember as a child is my dad dragging me to the bathroom
5929360	5934560	at dodger stadium and having to pee in a fucking trough there was a trough in the bathroom today
5934560	5940480	i almost washed my hands in it because i also had urinals yeah they had urinals and next to it
5940480	5944720	was a different they had to do this i almost washed my hands i almost washed my hands and
5944720	5952640	i'm gonna stay with steel urinal oh gay people we were at a gay bar yeah i'm assuming that's not
5952640	5958800	a gay thing i don't know it's not i think it's just a probably weird thing that's how you have
5958800	5966960	sex the pee goes down it comes back up and then you're having sex with each other that's the
5966960	5974640	sexiest gesture to describe it ever pee up and down that's it would you we do google gay people
5974640	5981440	i'm wild uh wait where were we i oh pee troughs okay no but here's the thing i think that's an
5981440	5988960	important enough thing to say like i think my demo my audience and i want to speak for you
5988960	5994240	i think it is important to them maybe this makes us children maybe this makes us geniuses maybe it
5994240	5998400	makes us wandering idiots that are like satisfied to be idiots maybe that makes us geniuses maybe
5998400	6004480	that makes us the biggest idiots of all but like i think we are really really super caught up with
6004480	6012880	the fucking fundamental line between do i need people uh or do i actually resent them like like
6012880	6018800	like like it's it's something that has per you know has particularly where we don't own that
6019600	6026080	i have i like like i i all of my formative experiences have like they have to do with like
6026080	6031840	this weird relationship between oh god i hope everyone likes me and oh i'm meeting this person
6031840	6035840	and i don't know what to do when i meet them and it's like i need them so bad and it's so
6035840	6040720	explosively uncomfortable that it's just like oh i just like like the the wiring goes through me
6040720	6045440	in a different way and it's like like like uh i trying to calculate my relationship with other
6045440	6051440	people and i'm trying to but at the same time my heart explodes with need from other people
6051440	6057440	and it's like that is like that's it's not to be taken lightly and i do think that people that
6057440	6062240	feel that kind of intentionally kind of assume you know this hillary versus bernie thing
6062240	6068480	that is very important but but whether this is a selfish or luxurious or privileged like statement
6068480	6073600	it's sort of like with what i'm going through that's sort of there that's the kale salad like
6073600	6077680	on the side is like is like who should run the country whoever's fucking running it they're
6077680	6082240	gonna be uh fucking neurotypical and they're gonna make my life a living hell i don't know
6082240	6087040	like they they're they're they're not gonna get me and no one and neither is 90 of everybody and
6087040	6091440	i'm gonna always like spend my life like pushing up against plexiglass and going like hey can
6091440	6095760	anyone over there hear me and if you can hear me do you think i'm cool and if i say do you think
6095760	6100240	i'm cool a little bit less will you think i'm cool so i'll fake it if you want me to fake it i'm
6100240	6104160	gonna do it but i'm also committed to honesty because i know that's cool so i will halfway
6104160	6110480	turn i'll give you a full Hitchcock profile and say does anyone think i'm cool do you think i'm
6110480	6115600	cool i fucked it up again god damn it i leaked Chevy chases voicemail i did it but i was like
6115600	6121040	like oh i'll turn my full back to you i'm a hermit psych did you like the hermit thing ah
6122080	6126640	like i did you wanting and needing and not wanting and not needing and like like i actually
6126640	6131360	and also on the other side of it like like people feeling their needs like walking into a room and
6131360	6137520	being able to read all of their fucking like deficits and liabilities and and assets and
6137520	6142880	like that's just like you just can compile them in an instant and you just read their minds and
6142880	6148480	and and it's like oh how do i react to the piano role of a conversation it's a struggle how do you
6148480	6157520	alleviate that pain liquor i not voting not voting voting it's a it's a it's like easter
6157520	6164000	it's like like oh who hid the eggs okay i like drinking that's what that's the choice that's
6164000	6170960	important like brown liquor white liquor yes i i didn't so first of all that didn't understand
6170960	6176320	any of that no i get you completely oh no no i understand where you're where you're going from
6176320	6181520	what all i meant by introvert and extrovert and i love that beautiful answer was um it's
6181520	6187360	a batteries thing that's actually what i meant by it like the um introverts they need to charge their
6187360	6192320	batteries themselves and extroverts charge their batteries with other people i really think of us
6192320	6200080	as machines i mean i'm uh psycho yeah yeah no i'm a very introverted person like i it's really
6200080	6205120	easy for me to talk to people behind a podium or a microphone and um if you chatted to me in the
6205120	6208400	green room while i was eating string cheese which you did it would be no problem and you
6208400	6212480	would assume that that was easy but i'm very i need to like spend a lot of time on myself same
6212480	6217680	here in order to fill up my yeah we're talking more but i don't it's different from like like
6217680	6221120	or the larry sanders character where it's like oh this is artifice it's like this is where we
6221120	6224960	actually talk to each other not to say that we don't then go talk to each other backstage but
6224960	6229520	then we don't we're workaholics and blah blah blah okay continue no that's all i meant so so
6229520	6234000	i agree with you there's total nuance in terms of social interactions and i was just talking about
6234000	6238880	like hey what fills you up so that you can go do your job and is it is it time by yourself
6238880	6243280	or is it time with other people i think it's uh my cookie clicker game right now yeah so time
6243280	6246880	by yourself that's what i'm talking about my friend yeah and i think a lot of performers
6246880	6252000	are actually people that really need a focused way of spending their energy for me it feels very
6252000	6255840	comfortable to be behind a microphone because it feels very controlled i have a problem with
6255840	6261120	lack of control and um so i've just gone through we're weird machines like we're just we're it's
6261120	6266480	spousal galactic is real so i've just gone through this weird transition and another
6266480	6270640	transition in my life like i don't have another yeah well this one better be good this one's good
6270640	6275840	this one's this one's i'm sorry but this one's much more positive and much more complete i mean
6275840	6281440	if you're about to tell us you went from vanilla to rocky road no we're gonna be like so what i
6281440	6289200	went from research scientist at a laboratory to the public face of a museum okay okay i'll stop
6289280	6295440	beating that joke that i'll stop being elaborate so i went from from like what we call a bench rat
6295440	6299760	i mean someone who just literally spent all their time at the research in a research center working
6299760	6304720	on things i couldn't tell anybody about i did that for like 16 years to being the the the the
6304720	6311440	research scientist presenting the face of of a museum i have to lecture i have to travel around
6311440	6318880	the country i have to do all this do blogs i have to do videos and stuff i'm an introvert i've
6318880	6323040	always thought of myself as an introvert but i've what i've discovered is i also really like to be a
6323040	6328560	teacher not because i like being in front of people not because i really like lecturing but
6328560	6335280	because i like teaching people i like watching the lights turn on in people's in people's eyes
6335280	6339840	when they that's that's my nectar right i mean that's the thing that actually makes it worthwhile
6339840	6344800	but after giving a lecture someplace i will go back to my hotel room and i will curl up and i
6344800	6354160	will cry because it was such a beastly experience for me to do it but in the end it was so important
6354160	6360000	for the people that i did it for but that as spencer talks about like like like like before
6360000	6367760	performing i cry a lot and you shut up about it you puke before you like have to perform oh yeah
6367760	6371600	i get sick to my stomach great when you cry though yeah it's like a real pretty cry it's
6372240	6376960	worth it but if you but if you do something and you know you nailed it why would you curl up and
6376960	6381760	cry it's this weird dynamic and i think it permeates a lot of the stuff that we were talking about
6381760	6388480	today this idea of what really motivates you you're motivated by the positive right that you're
6388480	6393520	doing something good in the world but you're also doing something to cover up something some personal
6393520	6399680	pain whether whether it's shame or whether it's guilt or whether it's something in your past
6399760	6406720	that you're always trying to do what's motivating you at a number of different levels and for me
6406720	6411760	it's shame i mean i remember being a child and never being able to perform well enough to make
6411760	6415280	people happy what are you expressing when you're crying when you go home to the when you go to the
6415280	6424480	hotel absolute absolute fatigue uh-huh but also just this overwhelming sense of did i actually do
6424480	6430560	well uh-huh did i everybody's telling me that's a loss of identity exactly yeah because you don't
6430560	6438000	even know i don't even know because it's so out of kilter with this this this world view that i
6438000	6442080	assigned to myself and you have no recourse to integrity because you're like oh am i just a
6442080	6448080	floating like fucking cloud of i hope everyone likes me yeah or learns from me or whatever right
6448080	6453280	right you you and if that's the case wouldn't i function just as well in the third rike as i do
6453280	6458320	here in this environment and therefore what am i do i that hasn't crossed my mind it should you
6458320	6470560	fucking nazi i'm standing my ground i'm not gonna say i was kidding i'll be it's a post louis ck
6470560	6477040	world the comedy should be drier i'm not gonna crack and say except that you'll now find me
6477040	6482480	curled up in a bedroom in your house oh god it's gonna be my house it's in your house
6483600	6490000	you have to i'll be in en suite in your and then what if the pillowcases from the guest room gets
6490000	6495120	get mixed up with the with the master bedroom pillowcases and your your tears of uncertainty
6495120	6500320	somehow get into my pores like three weeks from now and i don't even know why but i'm having an
6500320	6508800	extra girlfriend hitty dream okay not not a funny callback didn't i didn't like the
6510800	6514720	you guys are like well there's there's dot connecting in the third act of a show and then
6514720	6522560	there's the wire where you just the now it all makes sense and uh yeah dan we thought your show
6522560	6528640	was the wire we're not just tired and wanting to go home and watch game of thrones
6528640	6535360	all right well it's uh getting about that time uh jane are you gonna watch game of thrones with
6535360	6542160	uh with cody and i i've never watched an episode of game of thrones oh don't start now perfect
6542160	6547280	time to jump in no no everybody is yeah exactly yeah just get in tonight you won't miss a thing
6547280	6552320	no no yo straight up there's this chick and she's trying to not have a face don't worry about it
6552640	6560160	ha ha you'll figure it out it's intuitive is the short guy who's a good actor is he still
6560160	6565200	is he is he is he is he a good actor relative to all people are just the best shot we don't know
6565200	6569200	and we'll never know the dragons i like dragons he's a dragon now he's a dragon he just turned
6569200	6573440	into a dragon the one last episode there's they'll get it in the recap don't worry about it there's
6573440	6580480	three dragons one is castrated and uh can't be burnt and that dragon has taken over uh the wall
6581440	6588000	the wall is south of king's landing and uh is covered with an umbrella called the unsullied yeah
6588000	6592160	yeah and i think a major point just to remember is if there's a male character
6592160	6597360	and and this does exist in a very gendered dichotomy if there's america male character not
6597360	6601440	a lot of trans characters which is weird although i guess like brand of tarth maybe i don't know my
6601440	6606160	point is if there's a male character she's definitely genderqueer yeah she's got some shit
6606160	6610960	going on in the chai line um i want to get on her shoulders and i want to go somewhere
6612080	6613760	she could carry you easily
6616800	6622080	right Renly yeah yeah just because she has a crush on us you can't be straight in her gender
6622080	6626480	shit it can't help it has a crush on you genderqueer is not a sexual orientation it is the way you
6626480	6630240	present yourself i love the other wilding we have to decouple those two things yeah that's very
6630240	6635520	wild but also i love that like that was your limit i like watching what people's limits are
6636400	6643600	two hours in like fuck yourself she likes that other guy that that is the first time you brought
6643600	6649520	up game of thrones yeah like don't yeah and and and she's she's a lady and i have no idea what
6649520	6653760	was happening there but she obviously was like no wait a minute don't tell me i'm fucking anything
6653760	6660560	other than the almost awesome person in the world for consuming this material uh it's got like well
6660560	6668000	i was got is it is it uh what's his name uh the baldy baldy von eunuch verus he spider
6669200	6675760	didn't he establish at one point that even before they involuntarily unit eunuch him he
6675760	6680480	had he was kind of a sexual hasn't he hinted at that honestly damn that's a great point
6681120	6687600	it's not a good point and you're being sarcastic no you're using lesbian sarcasm yeah that that is
6687600	6693360	the face of lesbian sarcasm to be fair i've heard about it my mom warned me about it now you gotta
6693360	6699200	taste i read some like backstory stuff on him he was like was he mailed to someone in a box
6699200	6703040	we don't know what's going on remember when he got mailed that guy in the box and they just
6703040	6707360	dropped that he's like oh here's the guy in the box this doesn't sound like a positive trans
6707360	6712160	role model to me well what i was gonna say is also like if you're watching a male character
6712160	6716640	and they're on screen like some shit might happen they might fight you don't know if you're watching
6716640	6723200	a female character some bad some stuff's gonna go down right that's a really true okay well we
6723200	6728560	can exhibit that's really like so you're saying that two dudes in game of thrones can meet without
6728560	6732320	one of them stabbing the other one in the gut well they can they can have like side conversations
6732320	6736320	we're like what are you getting are you coming to see these whores yeah i am have you raped lately
6737920	6741440	what are you doing tip of the cap to me sir are we up here by this wall
6742160	6744400	watch game of thrones she thinks it takes place in the 20s
6746000	6749760	boardwalk empire i know they're access to game of thrones they're always like
6749760	6755120	they're like what now notice from the wall you know that we say that there's giants beyond the
6755120	6761760	wall and it's like tammany hall they always say that we know about it we haven't had the five
6761760	6766640	dollar plug from jeff because he's not here but that was worth five dollars for the people who
6766640	6772960	don't have the the podcast thank you that was awesome i don't know what you're talking about
6772960	6781760	that was physical it was very visual but i mean i i'm gonna assume that i'm like i i find myself
6781760	6787120	like when i when i'm watching game of thrones the limited extent to which i'm like scanning for
6788240	6794480	like like like uh uh female abuse like like in terms of like like how like like like in terms
6794480	6799840	of which characters have status like i kind of feel like there's i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
6799840	6805760	throw out a word like equal because i think the world is kind of honestly primitive and and like
6805760	6811760	like it's like intentionally not like like but but within that context it seems like oh jeez for a
6811760	6818880	for a soap opera set in a world where uh everyone without a dick is weaker than everyone with a dick
6818880	6825840	that within that context that there's a heck of a lot of like representation agency among the
6826960	6830160	female characters that you're watching them make choices and affect their power
6830160	6836560	sirs he has where there's no stabbing there are people in this show that have power on all sides
6836560	6842400	i'm loving me that little faceless aria stark a girl has no name please i know your name
6842560	6846080	well my point is let's agree on one thing that shit got boring
6849040	6854880	it's sagged it's sagged for a while i will say that the moment where i stopped diligently watching
6854880	6860720	this show was when joffrey like uh fucked a woman hold on plug your ears plug your ears
6860720	6866240	plug your ears this is seasons ago i'm assuming based on the looks of all of you that you're caught
6867120	6874000	rape spoiler alert yeah no he he uses a crossbow on a lady and it's uh it's like it's like uh
6875120	6883600	it's uh it's as if somebody bought a croissant in the morning it's a very side of like the
6884400	6889760	there's no plot point to it it's just uh happening you felt like like did you were
6889760	6895360	you a sopranos fan uh i'm trying to think of like other shows where do women get killed in shows
6896480	6905520	yeah no they do well the decidedly random like seemingly totally unattributed acts of totally
6905520	6915280	random violence um uh in my mind because i'm not definitely a different perspective have like like
6916320	6922000	all i ever perceive is i go man part of what makes this show really great is that you never fucking
6922000	6928400	know like literally peter dinklage could die in the next episode and they'd be like dude we
6928400	6934480	told you don't don't assume that's like a valuable thing in a show where we're like conditioned
6934480	6939520	that that that's my that's my privileged like consumption of that frosting as i go
6939520	6945040	all i'm perceiving is hey i don't know what's gonna happen next up she got raped um and you're
6945040	6948400	you're perceiving it from a different perspective are you like you're you're you're like oh yeah
6948400	6953520	that's the eighth rape okay yeah i kind of feel like women can be powerful without having
6953520	6958000	to have a reason that they became powerful which was their rape um and that happens a lot in that
6958000	6962880	show where they're like we're gonna make sure this woman could be powerful somebody attack her
6963440	6968480	um and i just think like ladies got that shit already and uh it statistically happens to a
6968480	6973520	lot of us so it ain't no entertainment he could he could have the the source material at which
6973520	6980400	that series is based that gentleman could have created a world in which by coincidence as well
6980400	6987200	if you can fart smoke that kills a guy um he he theoretically could have created a world where
6987200	6993040	there where women and men are not that where that there that that that that power shift does not
6993040	6997440	exist it's just hard to watch it's not even like i have like some huge political statement where
6997440	7002400	i'm like sitting there going like this doesn't match my hillary clinton love like there's
7002400	7006800	there's nothing to it's it's just hard to watch that stuff i have to i have to like fast forward
7006800	7013040	through it's just not fun to it's it doesn't feel like oh the stakes are really being ramped up now
7013040	7017280	i just don't want to look at and also those actors it's actually also that i feel for those actors
7017280	7021280	who have to go through that the gals who are like that that's their job on that day and they have to
7021280	7025760	be like like there's a whole crew you know like you do this job enough and you know that there's
7025760	7029200	like a whole crew and that like they got to set that morning it was a five o'clock in the morning
7029200	7034320	they're in like the ukraine or whatever and they were like okay so it's like a closed set because
7034320	7039520	like sansa's gotta be in the third grade and it's like a whole pursuit of it yeah it's just it really
7039520	7044560	it stresses me out there is a there is a distinct lack of uh of dangling dong in the in that show
7044560	7049120	right well also like i love to i love to look at penises on screen because i want to know what's
7049120	7057440	going on how are they attached i don't okay here's mostly mostly crazy yeah you guys know there's
7057520	7062480	double-sided tape here's if this is a spoiler fuck you you should shimless the package you're
7062480	7069040	welcome after uh uh what's his fuck uh boring guy uh uh uh kid harrington comes back to life uh
7069040	7075120	um uh and the and and and beardy pants like uh uh beardy pants the the the the thought balloon
7075120	7080480	over dan harman's head that character of the wildlings uh big pop eye red orange red beard
7080480	7085920	when he when he like he goes like they think they think you're a god they think you they think you
7085920	7098080	came back to life what do you think i've seen your dick nobody this magic could have a dick like
7098080	7104480	that that's small and cody like as fate would have it because of like trying to catch up and
7104480	7108960	falling asleep and stuff we watched that scene twice and the second i was like i watched and
7108960	7113520	and he said that he's like oh nobody could have a dick like that and and i was like all right come
7113520	7118560	on and and cody was like that's what you said last time i didn't remember because i was drunk
7119200	7123760	i was like i i i just think that's funny it's like that's the extent of like where where game
7123760	7131600	of thrones is abrading my sexuality is that one barbarian said to some emo guy like i think you
7131600	7138800	dick is i saw you dick and it's small and i and i'm like take it easy game of thrones not cool
7139040	7148640	is we're not dick shaming all right i believe dragons are here i i love those titties and all
7148640	7152880	the swords and the sorcery is there a road island equivalent in the game of thrones
7153760	7159920	but let's not live in a world where a man can just fucking like let's not use this genre as license
7159920	7168640	to abuse i think we agree on that if i was magic and could come back i'd have any kind of dick i
7168640	7172320	want it though i mean if i we can't couldn't be killed what is that no you can't that's not how
7172320	7178400	it works it's not star man he can't but you know same body that's the whole point that's the thing
7178400	7182720	that offended me it's like it's like if you had bypass surgery and the guys and the surgeons were
7182720	7189520	like his dick small it's like not cool meanwhile in rape country are you done raping mike uh no
7189520	7194400	i'm behind a shift all right i'll help you later and then and then tv guide complaints i'm like
