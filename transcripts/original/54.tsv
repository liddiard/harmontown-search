0	23080	Hello, everybody. Welcome to the meltdown. Harman Town is now in session. I'm your little
23080	28120	old comptroller, Jeff Davis. Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Ken
28120	49520	Harman. What a lively crowd. It's not just like eight people that are going to bum everybody
49520	54000	else out, right? It's actually a lively crowd. You can never tell from listening. Is there
54000	60360	a bachelorette party out there? Everyone else is not actually that excited. It's just Caroline
60360	65040	and her friends. We made them wait. It's eight. Oh, it's a little late. It's 8.15. We made
65040	70040	them wait seven minutes longer than normal. Yeah, their five hours are kicking in. Okay.
70040	77080	Well, look, I'm glad your energy is up. Mine's a little down. My body's sore. Softball practice
77080	96800	started. It just registers as a joke that I'm playing softball at all. My animation
96800	103080	studio Starburn Industries has a softball team in some kind of league, and we got together
103080	110000	to practice, and it's looking pretty grim. But it was kind of nice. I was dreading the
110000	116120	actual experience myself, but I actually kind of enjoyed being out there. I didn't die.
116120	120200	Two days later, it's like you don't exercise at all, and you go to the gym, and you feel
120200	125440	great. And then two days later, all those torn muscles that are now repairing themselves
125440	132440	or however muscles work, all of a sudden you're all sore. That's where I'm at. So whatever.
132440	140320	Who cares? Go fuck yourself. We were thinking about, because of the scheduling conflict,
140320	144280	because we're going to be playing softball on Monday nights, we came this close to taking
144280	149040	a little hiatus from our Harman Town meetings, and then we meltdown that, and they were all
149040	154320	bummed out, and they said, what about Sundays? So starting May 6th, for those of you who
154320	160640	come to the shows here in LA, we're going to be moving to Sundays at 8 for at least a
160640	168640	couple months. I think that's a better night. I can hear a couple people crying. But who's
168640	176720	got the biggest conflict? Was somebody going to be unable to come from now on? Is your
176720	188400	waving your hand back there? What's wrong? Why can't you come? Well, will you? How much
188400	202080	are they paying you? Because we'll double it. What do you do for a living? We're a cheesecake
202080	210080	factory. Okay. Well, I don't know. I don't know what to say to him. It's not that easy
210080	216200	for everybody, you know? Yeah. All right. So anyway, you can't swap out with somebody
216200	223200	on a Sunday night? Monday night. Monday night, rather? I'm a very important member of the
223200	228560	cheesecake. Yeah. You're a big wheel in cheesecake town? He said he's a very important member
228560	234120	of the cheesecake team. I don't know what the... Yeah. I didn't want to suggest that
234120	239360	he quit. I mean, it could be an important step in the right direction for him. We don't
239360	247200	know. Erin McGathey, my girlfriend, has recently become a cake maniac. She's making a million
247200	253520	cakes a day. She made several cakes for tonight. She made one for Emily. I think it must be
253520	259680	Emily's birthday or anniversary of her cat or something. She made one cake and then she
259680	265320	made another cake in honor of a movie we watched when we couldn't find the movie that I said
265320	272840	we were going to watch, which is The Abominable Doctor Fives. So I didn't see that. Nor did
272840	278560	I. I couldn't find it. It wasn't on Netflix or Hulu or any of the thing in the Apple TVs and
278560	285760	my video store didn't have it. We bought it on Amazon. Okay. You bought it? We're going to table
285760	290840	it for next time. What's your name, ma'am? Marcy. Okay. Bring out the cake.
295320	308720	The squeaky wheel always gets the grease at Harmon Town. It's a beautiful Jaws 4 cake. There's a
308720	315040	little chocolate Mario Van Peebles getting eaten to death. Even though in the movie he doesn't
315040	321120	really die, spoilers, Mario Van Peebles gets placed in the shark's mouth gently and lowered into the
321120	327920	ocean by this helicopter-like shark. And then he pops up at the end and says, yeah, man, you
327920	334800	thought I was dead, but I wasn't, man. And he talks just like that in the movie for real. Is that the
334800	340400	movie where they use the flash and the camera to make the shark go crazy? Yeah. And then you find
340400	348600	out the sharks have vocal cords and the shark goes. And then Mrs. Brody rams the shark with the,
349000	359680	what do you call it? The bowsprits? The shark impaler. And the shark explodes. It explodes on
359680	365480	contact with the thing. And so to make that make sense, they intercut it with Roy Scheider saying,
365480	369240	smile, you son of a bitch for the first movie. So that you think like, well, maybe it kind of
369240	374360	exploded reminiscently. And then it goes down and there's this piece of wood kind of halfway
374360	379240	through the shark, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'll tell you that shark was as abominable as Dr. Fibes
379240	385280	himself. Thank you for all the trouble you went through to watch that movie that I didn't watch.
385280	402760	Here's Marcy. This is your shark cake. She has to leave. You have to leave. I'm sorry. You can't
402760	412400	have that cake in here. You can't have your cake in Harmon town too. No, that's just the shark
412400	419920	damage. You're looking at like a dismembered Van Peebles and saying it's been partially eaten,
419920	426160	but that's all part of the verisimilitude of the cake. There was a while there in movies where
426160	430800	they were making animals yell. They don't, they don't have vocal cords or voice boxes. I'm pretty
430840	437960	sure in arachnophobia, there was a, it was a spider when I popped a wheelie and came at you
437960	442160	and yelled at you. You'll, you'll make a lot of crazy choices when you're looking down the barrel
442160	446880	of a stinker in the final audio mix. You know, like you got that big board in front of you and
446880	453200	a whole computer and you're just like juice the spiders. I'm looking at a Jeff Daniels vehicle
453200	459440	here. I thought it seemed like a good idea on paper, but that's not, um, give the give the
459440	465000	spiders some juice. Um, the, uh, uh, that's what they did on the exorcist when the, you know,
465000	470640	they made the devil sound like some bees in a box or something, right? Okay. Uh, I probably don't
470640	474120	have to tell you this, but I'm feeling a little off tonight. And, uh, for that reason, I've,
474120	480120	I've surrounded myself with a blanket of friends, uh, who to give me energy and, and, uh, offset my
480120	485240	softball soreness. Um, so let's, let's, let's keep this bullet train on the tracks and bring up my
485240	500040	friend, Duncan Trussell. Grab any, any mic you like wherever you're comfortable, buddy. Thank you.
500040	504200	It's good to have you back. Thanks, Dan. Thank you. Good to be here. I thought,
504200	508240	I thought we could bring you out here and, uh, uh, yeah, keep the spirits up. Cause I know your mom
508240	520560	just died and, uh, yeah, I'm grieving. Is it true? Yeah. I don't know why he's so happy about it.
520560	524920	You're handling an awfully well. Well, I told you a couple of episodes ago about Duncan,
524920	531800	actually podcast his, his mom's death bed. I don't know how else to put it. I mean,
531800	535200	it wasn't technically, she died on a different bed. So it was like the bed,
535760	545120	the bed before death bed. It was the anti-death bed. Yeah, exactly. Uh, yeah. The, uh, I mean,
545120	551840	he sat with her. I mean, I know that doesn't sound like a sale. Like, like, like, like, like,
551840	555200	like I, if I heard that on paper, it wouldn't be like, I'm going to listen to that on the way to
555200	562160	work. Uh, slam dunk that pitch. But, um, it's, it's a transcendental experience. It's incredibly,
562240	567040	it's, it's, it's neither saccharine nor is it, uh, depressing. It's, it's, it's just,
567040	570640	it's just transcendental and uplifting. I mean, it's, it's, it's a guy talking to,
572240	577840	and I mean, it was, it was, it was, I mean, it was so important for you to do that because like,
577840	582880	like there's, there would have been so easy not to look like, like there's so many reasons not to.
582880	587840	Yeah. Well, she wanted to do it. See, I was sort of, I was putting it off because she had said,
587840	592320	you know, we should probably do one of your podcasts. And I just, I just, the whole experience,
592320	605040	I don't know if it's, are your parents still alive? Yeah. See, well, the whole experience
605040	609520	is not what you expect when one of your parents, it's the, the problem with it is it's just not
609520	616400	what you expect. And all these crazy, uh, defense mechanisms start floating up from inside of you
616400	622160	that you did they like, like denial of the experience or well, basically like, uh, I've,
623200	629440	many, many years ago for some reason, I did some volunteer work at a hospice and they sort of walk
629440	635520	you through the death process. And one of the things that they said was, uh, people die like
635520	642560	they live. So when you're dying, you sort of, it's like your life repeats over the course of
642640	647440	two or three weeks. It just, you go through every single pattern. You like all those patterns that
647440	652960	you keep repeating and repeating and repeating. So I'm just going to play Minecraft. Yes,
652960	657680	you will know you'll play video games. And then also any kind of relationship stuff that you have,
657680	662320	you'll probably relive in any kind of like, you know, that, that, that track that you're always,
662320	666720	that people are inevitably on the repeating track that happens again and again in your life,
666720	673040	like some weird echo, that echo happens super sped up when you're dying. And it doesn't just
673040	677200	happen to you. It happens to the people around you. They start reliving all the old patterns.
677200	684000	So what I was doing while my mom was dying is, uh, I, uh, uh, went into the basement and just
684000	689920	started playing star craft, just playing star craft to try to like, uh, as you know, escape.
689920	693520	Cause when I was like, okay, so I'm sorry. So the cycles that are happening, are they happening to
693760	698160	to the person that's dying or yeah. And you said everyone also happened to everyone.
698160	702960	All your defense mechanisms kick in because you're, you're sort of standing at the brink of
702960	709200	infinity. You're in the presence of absolute truth that there's, you can't escape from,
709200	713120	there's no way to bargain with it. You can't. So what happens is all your defense,
713120	718240	you try to stick your head in any kind of sand that you can find to escape from the,
718240	723520	you know, the void basically. So, but your mom, your relationship with your mom,
723520	729360	I was surprised to hear this cause I would have guessed just through natural parental math
729360	737680	that your parents were either truck drivers or football coaches because you are this Zen guy
737680	742720	who was like into the, like from the bag of ed Gita to the doubt aging and everything in between.
742800	748640	There's actually only a couple of things in between those two. It's a, but, but, but you are,
748640	754480	you're, you're, you're, your brain is this, this spiritual, you know, a tree branching out into
754480	758800	everything. The roots drinking deeply from everything beneath you and the leaves. I love
758800	768080	you. I love you too. I wish I was like that. But then, but then the podcast started rolling.
768080	772160	I was like, okay, what is this going to be? First of all, I expected to hear like the,
772160	779520	the, the Darth Vader sound of an air device, you know, yeah. I, and I definitely expected
779520	785120	her to be in firm vocally, you know, like there would be this horrible experience of listening
785120	790880	to a person that wasn't able to live anymore. But beneath all of those very surfacey expectations,
790880	796560	I also expected her to not have a personality as much like yours. And it's not an exact match,
796560	799840	but, but she's, she's seemed almost seems like she was some kind of mentor to you.
799840	804000	She was. Yeah. She was. She definitely was in a lot of ways. She's, she's the,
804800	809920	I mean, yeah, that book, I was going through her books and I first found the Bhagavad Gita or
809920	816720	found any kind of Eastern religion or anything like that. So that means that your dad must have been.
818000	823120	No. Okay. All right. Well, no, my dad is just this crazy. Yes. My dad is the,
823120	827040	where I rebel from. Cause my dad is this, like he, when I was a kid,
827040	831840	I grew up in the South and he used to take me hunting and I hated hunting. I didn't want to
831840	836080	go hunting. And so I'd end up sitting in the back of this truck with, because when you go dove
836080	842000	hunting, you just, you don't kill a few dove. You kill piles, like holocaust piles. Is it even a
842000	847040	thing? I didn't even know. Oh yeah. They kill doves. They go out and they just shoot doves.
847040	851120	That's like killing Christmas trees. Yeah. I guess they do that too. I guess that's how they
851120	858720	become Christmas trees. I didn't think the doves on the trees were also had to be. No,
858720	865680	yeah. We would hang doves on the trees, dove corpses on the tree. So I would like,
866320	872080	one story that my dad likes to bring up when he's, when he's around his Southern friends or
872080	876880	drinking is like, I took you hunting. You're sitting in the back of the truck and you started
876880	887440	trying to breathe life back into the doves bodies. You're a star man. Yeah. Yeah. So that's
887440	894560	probably where they're, you think you star man, you ain't no star man. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably
895520	900560	where the rebellion thing happened. Right. Your dad was corporeal. Your dad was visceral. He was,
900560	906320	he was of the mortal coil. That's right. Exactly. Yeah. That's exactly right. But still a really
906400	914800	cool, interesting Southern guy. But yeah, you know, I read one of your blogs to my mom on her
914800	920000	pre-death. Oh, that's right. Justin said something about that. She thought it was so fucking funny,
920000	926160	man. You made somebody with late stage cancer authentically laugh and she compared you to,
926160	935680	she said that you remind her of Dylan Thomas. Yeah. I know. I know. I got a text message about
935680	942560	it and I wrote it down. I mean, that, that was incredibly flattering. But it put me at this weird
942560	948320	straight in the spotlight on, cause I was being a voyeur watching you in this relationship with
948320	954240	your mom and her death and all this stuff. And I am a rampant narcissist. I, I will insert myself
954240	960640	into anything wrap, bend everything toward me. Like my, my ego has just, it's, it's like some
960640	965920	singularity. It just has like, it's the size of a penny, but has the gravity of Jupiter. It just,
966640	972720	I play that unassuming like, Oh, a little old me game. And he just sucked into me. Everything's
972720	978000	about me. 10 seconds before the word I or me comes into, it doesn't matter what we're talking
978000	981920	about. And, and so I was listening to that and I was thinking in my head, I was like,
981920	988480	I wonder what she'd think of my, my writing. There you go. No, she thought it was, she thought it
988480	994080	was hilarious, man. But you know, she was, she, she was, that by that time the cancer gone into her
994080	1011120	brain. Only the, only the taste center. All her other faculties about it. The grain of salt.
1011840	1014400	The last thing she said is man, those earnest movies.
1015200	1019280	I wish, I wish he had gone one more place.
1022320	1024080	And Dan Harmon's like Dylan Thomas.
1027360	1031680	But anyways, I thank you so much for having done that because I mean, I don't, I mean, I won't,
1031680	1036480	like I'll, I'll have an experience. Well, if I'm, if I'm, if I'm, if I'm quote unquote lucky,
1036480	1042880	either, either I will die before my mom or, or, or my mom will die before me, but assuming my
1042880	1046720	mom will die before me, I don't know why I'm qualifying all this because I'm superstitious
1046720	1053040	and weird and death is fucking weird and even, even viewed from, from the deer blind of, of,
1053040	1057120	of, of it not being reality. Like it already starts to get awkward and weird and you,
1057120	1062560	you want to knock on wood after everything you say and you want the dying to be invisible,
1062560	1069520	which is why it makes it already hard process even harder. And, and, and that tunnel is what
1069520	1074400	you go through when you listened to that podcast episode, you come out the other side,
1074400	1078800	if only for a moment, because already I feel weird about death again, but, but for that,
1078800	1084560	that, that, that period of time and all day at work that day, it was like, fuck man, so much
1084560	1091360	shit that I was afraid of, you know, is not, it's not a thing to be afraid of. It isn't,
1091360	1095680	you know why it's not a thing to be afraid of? Because you can't understand it. It's impossible
1095680	1101920	to understand it. It's not anything that you expect. You can't being afraid is every,
1101920	1109200	it's kind of like any reaction you have to death is like kicking sand at Godzilla. It's a,
1109200	1115120	there's no reaction you can have to it because it is, it's a, it's a singularity and it's in.
1115120	1121120	So there almost seems to, it seems pointless to contemplate it too much, even though all the,
1121200	1127760	a lot of Eastern traditions say that meditation is the preparation for death, you know, because
1127760	1133200	when you, I guess it's kind of like you don't, if you can avoid it, you don't want to relive your
1133200	1137680	life in the last two weeks of your life. If you can avoid it, you want to have this stable,
1138240	1144480	steady thing and not go into all the old neurotic aspects of your life. Cause it's,
1144480	1148720	cause it's a terrifying, I mean, now I was just saying, don't be afraid of it. Now I'm saying it's
1148720	1156480	fucking scary, but you can't breathe. You're in pain. They put you, it's, it's really, I haven't,
1156480	1161200	I haven't really, um, I'm, my brain is still stuttering from it. And, and my therapist says
1161200	1164560	it's like, at least that's the other thing I wanted to ask you about is now you want you,
1164560	1170880	and you went on tour right after right as it was happening. And, and, and now you're back. And,
1170880	1176400	and I know you were via Dustin who's, you know, this is a little, this is a little gossip. Yeah.
1177040	1182000	Um, uh, he, he said that you were, you know, having trouble, uh, getting out of the house
1182000	1186880	and feeling a little like, yeah, I'm depressed. Yeah. But that's not grief is depression,
1186880	1194720	but I've retired. What I do is I buy robots and feed birds and just sit like my brain is
1194720	1202000	reacting in this weird way where I bought a Roomba. I bought lights that I controlled my phone and a,
1202000	1208400	and a bird feed bird feeders. So I just sit with the Roomba. You're still breathing life
1208400	1214320	back into birds. Oh yeah. No, I'm not. I'm killing them. I've, I, so I'm sitting on my porch.
1214320	1216640	I've got, you didn't mix up the robot food with the bird food.
1223440	1228560	No, I, you know, I've set up my porch for this to like, as a place to read, I've got wind chimes,
1228560	1234720	a fountain, a bird feeders. And I bought all that stuff recently. Yeah. It's all part of this. Really?
1234720	1239200	All of that. I was just over at your place. They sell it as a whole package at hospitals.
1239200	1243920	You can buy a, as a wind chime bird feeder, uh, porch swing package you can get.
1244880	1249280	You, well, yeah, I got all of that is, I don't know what it is. Like everyone's telling me you're
1249280	1255120	grieving, so you're going to go crazy. So let yourself go crazy. And the more you let yourself
1255120	1260800	go crazy and be impulsive, the faster you'll get through it. So for me, that going crazy was,
1260800	1266800	Oh, I'll buy a robot vacuum cleaner and, um, hummingbird feeders. And the, so I'm sitting
1266800	1271360	on the porch proud of myself cause all the birds finally came to the feeder and it's covered in
1271360	1277120	birds and I'm watching the birds and I feel like the God of birds. Like when you have bird feeders,
1277120	1283280	you get this weird sense of like, this is because of me. I have, I am your Lord. And
1285520	1290480	I bring the food. It is because they were starving before that. Like maybe if somebody,
1290480	1295840	yeah, they're starving. Maybe if somebody wrong, just change migration routes.
1295840	1298560	And now they're all going to die eventually. Cause they, they, they came out of there.
1298560	1304640	Well, no, it already happened. Like I'm sitting there. Wind chimes are, are, are chiming the
1304640	1311440	fountain. It's so peaceful and a bird just like rockets right into my window, right in front of
1311440	1317760	me. Right in front of me. And, and, and I go over to it. It's little, and I, I had seen it.
1317760	1324000	I went to its body and a little trickle of red was coming out of its beak because it broke its
1324000	1329440	neck. I'd, I'd seen that bird on the feeder earlier in the day. Was it a hummingbird? No,
1329440	1334320	it was a Finch. Yeah. Cause they, okay. The hummingbirds don't hit the window there. They,
1334320	1338400	they seem like they would be incapable of that. You know, the secret is you have to, uh, dress
1338400	1346800	like a hawk. I sit on my porch dressed as a hawk. Your origin story of your new supervillain
1346800	1352320	character. You have to strike fear into those you love. It's very complicated,
1353760	1358400	but the Batman version's been taken. You know, you gotta, you want to be a superhero these days.
1358400	1362960	You gotta get, you gotta get labyrinthine. Oh yeah. That's a great, I would do, I would do that.
1362960	1366880	I mean, you would dress like a hawk. Fuck yeah. I dress like a hawk. You're on record. We're
1366880	1371680	recording this. I'll dress like a hawk and sit on my porch. All right. It's a weird,
1372960	1377760	I gotta tell you though, it's a very strange dimension that we're existing in when you,
1377760	1382800	and that's why bird feeders are cool because you just consider what's happening is such a bizarre
1382800	1390160	thing from the perspective of the bird, which is this giant tower of meat, like this HP Lovecraft
1390160	1396880	couture thing. The opposite of the bird is like, put these things out and they don't understand
1396880	1402480	what I have. And I stink to them. I like, there's some weird smells that birds hate is coming off
1402480	1408720	of me and they sit and, but they want to eat the food. So they sit and eat and like peer around
1408720	1413600	and look and then eat. Yeah. They must live in constant, whatever their version of fear is,
1413600	1418240	because they're surrounded by mammals that and 90% of them will hurt them if they grab them,
1418240	1421920	but then 10% of them don't, but they probably can't tell the difference between a cat and a
1421920	1427440	dude. They're just all, yeah, they're always, yeah, they exist in a hell world where one wrong move.
1427440	1432160	That's why they move like, like, like, you know, like baseball players in an old movie.
1432160	1439840	Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. And yeah, they, they, and I, I was watching them before the bird died.
1440720	1446880	And I was thinking, I bet there's an older bird somewhere being like, don't go to those feeders.
1449200	1454320	It's cursed near the feeders. You go near the feeders and you're cursed by the Lord of birds.
1454320	1459600	And then one of them smacked right into the window. He's like, see, the price is death from
1462240	1467040	he just fell right out of the air. Yeah. Nothing is like he hit a force field.
1467040	1470240	That's what it is. You know what a force field is, but you don't know what a window is.
1470480	1480240	I see him. We're trying to seize him, but we don't have hands. The bird equivalent of seizure.
1484400	1488160	Yeah. I don't know what's natural for a bird though. They're probably, I mean, they don't know,
1488160	1491680	like, like, like, like, like, what are they, I guess, digging up a worm, like in some cartoon,
1491680	1495200	like they got to be thinking someone put that there too. What am I talking about?
1495680	1501200	I should just shoot myself right now. Thanks guys. Thanks.
1502800	1506800	I'll keep saying that once a week until I stop getting that reaction. And then boom.
1509680	1515120	I know you're conflicted about that. A guy, a guy did that. Remember the guy who did that
1515120	1521920	a while ago in an open mic, a guy stabbed himself to death. You guys didn't hear about that. What?
1521920	1524240	This is in Colorado. Anthony Jeselnik.
1527200	1528320	It's like a couple of days ago.
1532800	1539200	Just fuck it. Yeah. What happened? What happened? Well, the story is like he came on stage
1539200	1544400	and he just played some song. I think the song was like, it had something to do with like,
1544400	1549360	sorry for the mess was the name of the song. And then he just started jamming a knife. Where was
1549360	1555600	this? This isn't, this isn't Colorado. So he just, I don't, I don't know, just some shitty
1555600	1562320	open mic, you know, like, did he die? Oh, he died. Yeah. He went up, he went up and murdered
1562320	1566240	himself in front of an audience. Yeah. He stabbed himself to death in front of a crap. He was a
1566240	1572960	shit. All right. It's a terrible thing to do to other people. It's true. It is true. You've talked
1572960	1578160	about that. Suicide is actually like a very selfish, you know, it's like the amount of
1578160	1582560	gravity that you exert in other people's lives. When you, when you, when you, when you take
1582560	1587360	yourself out of the picture, like, oh yeah, it's a, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's definitely a, uh,
1587360	1591520	those, those, I mean that in particular, I think suicide, suicide, when you have some kind of
1591520	1597360	chronic illness or something is, is totally cool. No, no, no, no. Let him suffer. I think it should
1597360	1601920	be illegal. No, no, no. All right. Let's, let's, let's, let's keep the bullet train moving. You
1602000	1605760	stay here. Let's bring up another friend, Mr. Greg Proops.
1624640	1629920	Your microphone's in your, in your took us. Oh man. I just realized that. Is that, is that,
1629920	1634640	is that why the extra energy when I, when I took the stage, are there profiles that are there?
1634640	1641760	All right. Good. I don't, I don't mean to say that harmonians are a bunch of sluggish oafs.
1642720	1645520	No, but profiles and harmonians can learn to live together
1646320	1649760	like the checks in the slow box did for all those years. What, what makes a
1649760	1654960	propofile a propofile? What, what, what sets them apart? If I could walk like a propofile,
1656960	1663360	a joie de vivre, a certain genocide, uh, a certain, uh, a sense of denial goes into every day of
1663360	1669680	living. I mean, yeah, total, like oxymoronic. I mean, you're a propofile. It's like, God,
1670480	1676720	think about how fruitless that is as a pursuit. And then you get a good idea of why propofiles
1676720	1682400	follow it. I think it's not a Sisyphusian pushing the rock up the hill and then the rock rolls back
1682400	1688320	down the hill kind of thing. Either that or some hilarious, uh, sitcom reference from the 70s.
1691360	1696000	More of a Starsky and Hutchian. Hey, don't, don't count it. I know from your perspective,
1696000	1700800	you think that that's like, uh, no, they just stare at me blankly all the time too. Oh, I know.
1700800	1706080	Yeah, I know. There's, there's Starsky and Hutch. They're like, what, uh, who is the Starsky and
1706080	1712160	Hutch you speak of when television was powered by water? Greg, have you met Duncan before you
1712160	1717440	guys? We haven't. And I've been very moved by what Duncan was saying. Uh, it's, uh, you're an
1717440	1722160	extraordinary person. You're very brave and you're very funny. And I adore your podcast and right on.
1722160	1726720	Thank you very much. Thank you, Greg. Thanks. That's amazing. I think he's been, uh, I think
1726720	1732240	he's been marvelously genuine tonight. Uh, something that I'm terrible at. So, uh, I want,
1732400	1735920	I wanted you guys to, to, to, I wanted to see what would happen if, uh,
1735920	1742640	cause I don't know. I have like, I have like three friends. Uh, certainly not. And I, but,
1742640	1747840	but I mean, I was like, like, like, like a lot of people have like, have like 20 or 30 people that
1747840	1752480	they're, that they call friends. And then they have like, let's say 150 people that they call
1752480	1757120	something else, like acquaintances or something. And I have like, I have like, like three people
1758080	1762480	that are my friends only because they're the only people that can tolerate
1763040	1767840	texting me and then not me not responding. Cause I was like, it's a Jeff. Are you that person? Yeah.
1767840	1775600	I guess. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. No, no, I don't. I'm, I'm terrible at answering emails and I do the
1775600	1780880	exact same thing, Dan. And it's this, it's a problem because people take it the wrong way.
1780880	1785680	They think it means you don't love them, but it's, it's, it's just, so then we can be friends.
1786320	1791280	Oh yeah. We already are friends. You already haven't responded to several of my emails.
1792480	1796880	This is great. It's like a honeymoon. You'll be friends, but you'll never ever have lunch together.
1798720	1801200	No, because you'll never be able to finish that series of texts.
1802720	1807600	You really have to love drinking a block from my house in order to become like really tight with me.
1809040	1812880	I feel like I'm raising up in this friend state here. Now that you've got the house,
1812880	1817600	Dan, and I think we could have all predicted this that like, I see you Monday nights here
1817600	1823440	at Harman town. And if I go to your house, that that's like, that I don't work at Starburnt
1823440	1827680	industries. And other than that, like I have, that's, that's where you're going to be.
1827680	1833360	Yeah. I'm getting bad and I'm sinking into a, I'm like, I'm a proud Minecraft addict. Like,
1833360	1839440	I just like, I'm so, I just like, it's, it's, it's obscene. What are you, what are you working on?
1839440	1844880	What's the, what's the new task in Minecraft? I've loaded up Minecraft with all these mods that
1844880	1849120	let you make all these different things. It's I'm, I'm, I'm working on making a nuclear reactor and I
1849120	1855360	have a, I've created my sixth solar panel. So I've just probably got to the point where solar energy,
1856640	1861840	what's that going? Yeah. I'm like Korea. Yeah. It doesn't matter. I mean, like,
1861840	1870560	if, if, if, if, if, if, if what was going on with me was interesting, I wouldn't, you know,
1870560	1875200	wouldn't be surrounding myself with people. When you leave the house to come to Harman
1875200	1879040	town, say tonight, I go, I go, Oh fuck, what am I going to talk to them about Minecraft?
1880240	1884640	Why not? I hope Greg Proops and Duncan Trussell show up. Greg, do you play video games?
1884640	1886880	What? You don't play video games. No,
1889280	1896480	I, but you know what? I don't, I don't, I don't shame people who do. Uh, I don't,
1896480	1903680	you just did the inflection. It wasn't intentional. The inflection was there.
1903680	1908240	The inflection was the inflection is you're counting lashes when you're whipping Jesus.
1908880	1916160	You know, Jesus had his bad side. Let me, let's not, let's not get no, you know,
1916160	1920640	you're being, he was asking for it. Exactly. You're, you're, you're making a value judgment.
1923040	1928240	Maybe my, my, my, my timbre or my tone indicated that I, that I, that I was diminishing people
1928240	1933760	who play games, but I think it's marvelous when people let their creativity run rampant, uh,
1933760	1939840	in that area. It's simply not for me. I think it's a generational thing. I was born in the
1939840	1954400	middle of world war. I was born in a crossfire hurricane. So the thing is, there's a healthy use
1954400	1963680	of your time. I don't, uh, I like to read and watch old movies and lately because Jackie Robinson's
1963680	1969760	movie came out this week, 42, I went and saw it the other day and I have, and my wife, you know,
1969760	1975280	imagine her disappointment when I bring four different books about Jackie Robinson out,
1975280	1979040	including two that he's written. I saw the poster at the grove and I was like,
1979040	1983520	I bet Greg's happy about that, uh, baseball movie coming out. Is it any good? It was,
1983520	1992960	it was he geographic as we say, uh, it, it, it, it portrayed him in a way, uh, that he geographic is
1992960	1996640	like when you take someone's history, like for instance, if I were to write the history of Dan
1996640	2002560	Harmon, go on, right? Like all of a sudden you'd be, you'd be pounding over a typewriter and pieces
2002560	2011680	of paper coming out and then there'd be stacks of them, right? And then Stephen Jake, yeah. And then
2013760	2019440	you'd take a sip from a bottle, but then we'd see in the garbage can 80 bottles, right? And then all
2019440	2024560	over the floor and a letter from my mom, right? And a can of tune out that's been upturned and
2024560	2029040	a cat that hasn't been fed an agent and why not. And I'd have an answering machine and there'd be
2029040	2036080	six messages in a row, all expository, right? Hey, it's your editor. Got another thing. Every single
2036080	2041680	one of them would explain your character, right? This is your mom. Why won't you call? You know,
2041680	2045680	one after the next. Yeah. That failed the eighties mom and the other end of the phone. But then when
2045680	2050880	you finally, when you like write the script that wins and you become Dan Harmon and shit,
2050880	2056640	uh, that's the moment we'd be like, I'm so grateful. There's one thing I want to thank
2056640	2061920	is God and shit. They didn't do that. So, so, okay. So, well, they didn't wait. They didn't,
2061920	2066640	they had to be a human, but like, I know way too much about this and I don't want to stop your
2066640	2070000	show, but I'm caught up on this word. Hey, geographic. I just want to make sure.
2070000	2077520	Hey geography is taking the history of someone and, uh, can you spell that word? Yeah. H A G I O.
2078480	2084000	Can you mine it in Minecraft? Yeah, I can. No, not mine. He wants to. Oh,
2086240	2090160	wait, you're, were you going to mine it? No, I was going to mine it.
2091680	2095360	He wasn't, he was mining, pulling a card. If you remember the seven dorms, they,
2095440	2101280	they worked in a mine all day. So it's spelled like H A G. Yeah. It's a Greek word and I'm not
2101280	2108400	certain what the prefix means, but in essence, what it, easy tiger. I'll take it from here. Thanks.
2110480	2114160	I know you've got some assburger people here tonight. It's just some Goldberg people.
2115520	2119440	You have many thesaurus is here and other tiny dinosaurs all around the audience.
2119760	2127360	It just means that it takes what was once a human experience and turns it into a movie experience.
2127360	2132080	You know, like for instance, you've seen Jeff and I often talk about the movie patent or,
2132080	2136640	or Lawrence of Arabia, which are great biopics, but like they have nothing to do with the actual
2136640	2140400	factually. There's not a single moment in the movie that probably happened. Well,
2140400	2145120	Pat didn't jump out on a balcony and start shooting his pistols as a plane going by.
2145920	2152080	Maybe he did. If he didn't, he ought to have. And that's what he actually said in the hallway of
2152080	2154640	it somewhere with sunlight coming in a bunch of windows. I hope he said,
2155200	2160640	is this some kind of sick joke? The entire world at war and God will not allow it.
2161600	2162960	That's my favorite part of the movie.
2165360	2168640	We travel a lot together. Greg and I will do the entirety of patent together.
2168640	2172880	Oh no. Two and a half hours. Yeah. It's horrible. And that that's the best part,
2172880	2175920	Dan. When it's an entire world at war and I'm not allowed to be in it.
2175920	2182480	God will not allow this to happen. I will be allowed to fulfill my destiny. His will be done.
2185760	2187520	Pat and his black bellies standing there like,
2189280	2193440	you know, but that's why movies are good because I once said to my wife,
2193440	2196720	if movies aren't better than real life, I don't want to live. Yeah. Yeah.
2196720	2200960	Movies are an extrapolation on life. They're not a, they're a reflection.
2200960	2205760	Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, a movie for better or for worse, the definition of it has become,
2206640	2210160	well, now it's been extended to three hours. I don't know why that movement.
2211520	2215840	It has something to do with the same reason why in the nineties graphic design posters went out
2215840	2220320	the window. It just became Denzel Washington's half of his face and half of whoever else's face
2220320	2227600	was in the movie. And then like a knife. I thought that would never end because, but, but I think
2227760	2231600	I've seen some cool posters lately. Like, like, like, it seems like graphic designers have started
2231600	2237840	to get paid again to pro to, to, to, but I think that maybe editing entered that, that, that thing
2237840	2241520	where they're like, wait a minute. We don't have to do three passes on this movie. Let's just make
2241520	2245280	it three and a half hours long. But you would think that the bottom line mentality would say,
2245280	2250160	no, make it 90 minutes so that we can show it in multiplexes or the rings movies are like eight
2250160	2254320	hours long each. I guess. But they must miss as they make so much money that everyone's confusing
2254320	2258320	that and going like, sure, let your Brad Pitt movie about the invention of ping pong be three
2258320	2264640	hours long. It'll be just like a Peter Jackson movie, by the way, the tiny net.
2266640	2270240	Have you, have you heard of these new theaters that they have in Japan that are coming here?
2270960	2275680	They're in China. Have you heard about these? There's, there's these new theaters, hardcore
2275680	2282160	theaters that drop bubbles onto the audience and have sent that they they're sweet. Yeah.
2282240	2290560	I can't wait. That's coming back. That the aspect of scent, like apparently it's coming to the
2290560	2296000	United States soon, but yeah, it's basically somehow they're emulating smell, which I've always
2296000	2300320	wanted to see what that would be like. Does anyone remember the book, Brave New World by Aldous
2300320	2305440	Huxley, where you held on to two, you held on to two electrodes during the movie and they were
2305440	2310640	called the fillets. So when people in the movie are raped and people in the movie are shot and
2310640	2316320	while you're watching, you're like, oh, and I always thought that really nailed it. Yeah.
2316320	2319840	Well, we're getting there. Yeah. I just put on one of those Oculus rift things. I don't know if
2319840	2325200	you know, this is like, they're starting to ship the development kits for these things that
2325200	2329680	when I was in my twenties, there was this concept called virtual reality in the nineties. And
2330320	2334080	everybody always looked at their hand. Like, like, like, like, yeah, everyone was like,
2334080	2338160	like, they inserted it into everything. Lucky charms commercials and virtual reality in it.
2338160	2343200	Like, like, like, oh, they'll never get my lucky charms if I won't go into virtual reality.
2345600	2348880	I'm not kidding. That's really not an exaggeration. Like there would be a,
2348880	2352640	the shitty movie of the month would come out with Michael Douglas and Demi Moore. Then they'd have
2352640	2359040	just a scene in between blow jobs where she was in virtual reality. Like the, the, the, the scene
2359040	2363920	where they go into the office and look through a filing cabinet was replaced with a scene of her
2363920	2368800	putting on goggles and going into a virtual filing cabinet. Anyways, lawnmower, man, yada,
2368800	2372960	yada. Then we dropped it because it got so embarrassing. It was like disco. It was like,
2372960	2378160	we've got so we, as soon as new years of 2000 happened, we're like enough with the goggles and
2378160	2382480	the people going like this, like no more strange days because it never really happened because
2382480	2389120	there's this kid started a Kickstarter kid. I call him a kid. He's probably under 50.
2389280	2394080	Um, the, he started a Kickstarter and said, look, I don't know why we gave up on this.
2394080	2399280	We can do this. This is a real thing. And, and it just got flooded with money and flooded with
2399280	2403360	agreements from software developers. Like, yes, yes, let's fucking do this. So anyways,
2403360	2408080	my friend, Justin Roiland, who's an insane, uh, uh, he's the co-creator of Rick and Morty. And he's
2408080	2412560	like this insane like collector of everything. He got one of these development kits, brought it to
2412560	2420720	the office. I put on these goggles and I was like, I'm standing in Tuscany, uh, like in a house
2420720	2427040	and I moved my head a little cautiously this way and there's shit over here and I'm everywhere.
2427040	2434640	I'm looking everywhere and there's Tuscany everywhere, 360 degrees of Tuscany, um, which
2434640	2440640	I'm recommending as the title of my biopic. Please, please let it be hagiographic.
2442160	2445200	It will be. Yeah. Because I've never been to Tuscany. Because you know what you'll,
2445200	2452000	in the first scene, you're burning your canvas and just fuming over it. You spent hours painting it.
2453200	2457280	And a wife that I've never had, but that's an amalgam of all of my girlfriends comes in and goes,
2457280	2462960	you need, you need. And then someone rides up on a donkey and goes, this is from the Pope. And
2462960	2471920	you're like, shit. Because you're in Tuscany. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, the, the, yeah. Anyways,
2471920	2475440	I don't know. It's happening. It's definitely happening. Like, like one look through these
2475440	2480080	things and the, just the realization that it's happening, that within five years,
2480080	2483840	because these things are super low resolution. They don't have proximity sensors on them. So
2483840	2488800	when you move your head that you, you get this like very, you get motion sickness very quickly.
2488800	2494080	You get like a weird nausea because of little tweaks that they need to make to this thing.
2494080	2497760	But once they make those tweaks and increase the resolution of these things, it's like,
2498720	2502720	unbelievable. I was talking to, I had a bride yesterday with a friend and they have a, like,
2503280	2508080	like a three month old, old baby. And we're talking like in two years that present that,
2508080	2514640	that we're talking about the ocular oculus rift. Yeah. Uh, that's going to be that baby's baseline.
2514640	2518400	Like, like, that's like, they're going to start out there. That's going to be so cool. But it's
2518400	2521840	going to be a pair of Ray-Bans, you know, it's not going to be a fucking ridiculous
2521840	2525440	set of goggles. And then, and then five years after that, it's going to be a,
2525440	2529680	you know, patchy put on your temple. It'll be already inserted. I know, I know this for a fact,
2530320	2535040	but there are jet packs in the eighties. Look, they happened eventually in the title
2535040	2542160	sequence for the fall guy because of, because of this technology, uh, this has created the,
2542160	2546080	this philosophy that we're in a simulation. This is something we always talk about,
2546080	2549280	but you're testing right now. It's actually accessible now,
2549920	2552800	which is interesting because in the other thing, like Plato's cave, it's like,
2553360	2559920	he's using state of the art technology to make his point candles shadows. Yeah. And it was like,
2559920	2563440	think about it. And if he was saying that to a caveman pre-fire and go like, what the fuck? Hey,
2563440	2567200	man, listen, I know you're trying to tell me that life is a dream, but I don't, I don't know fire
2567200	2572720	yet. Um, let alone the controlling the shadows and stuff. And, and, and this concept of actual
2572720	2577840	like video games have gotten so addictive and so immersive that you and I kind of like,
2577840	2581280	like, like talking about this, I've been on your podcast twice and we keep talking about.
2581280	2584800	Because it's the, because there's two, I think there's two reasons we talk about it. One,
2584800	2590800	because there is a technological tsunami that's about to destroy society because the moment the
2590800	2597200	technology advances to the point where that reality becomes more, uh, amazing than this reality
2597280	2604640	becomes, uh, indistinguishable from this reality. When it becomes age, age, geographic, is that what
2604640	2610720	you got? Life becomes vestigial. When the myth is better than the reality. Exactly. When that
2610720	2616320	happens, like movies are to me. Yeah. Yeah. Already people are hooked on world of Warcraft or even
2616320	2620800	movies are on, on these very low risk people won't want to travel. People already don't want to
2620800	2624560	travel, but people that feel like they should travel, but don't have the, I know Tuscany is
2624560	2630560	probably beautiful, but I really liked looking at fake low res Tuscany with motion sickness
2630560	2636000	through a pair of goggles. Right. Because it was more exciting because we have been, as a species,
2636000	2644560	we are instinctively, uh, uh, compelled to, I think destroy ourselves. Uh, we, we think create
2644560	2650480	ourselves. Campbell would say we have like a blueprint on our spinal cord of, uh, that's why
2650480	2656480	we create the gods that we worship. They have these, we have this fantasy that our purpose is
2656480	2662240	to be gods. Our purpose is to create life. Our purpose is to change the weather. Our purpose is
2662240	2667920	to defeat death. Our purpose is to teleport. Our purpose is to, uh, uh, you know, like, like reach
2667920	2672560	across the earth and grab the Lochmus monster by the neck and use it for salting our pizza. That's
2672560	2678560	it. That's the point of everything. By the way, that's exactly what I would do with the Loch Ness
2678640	2685920	monster. You know why? Because he's spicy. A lot of people don't think so because he's Scottish,
2685920	2690320	you know, they think it's going to be bland, but it'll be salty because Scotland only has two
2690320	2701440	spices. Salt and booze. Salt and freedom. You can take away my, but you can't take away me.
2702240	2708320	I think, I think a Scottish pizza, uh, half Loch Ness salt, half freedom.
2709920	2714480	Aye. That's all we got, man. It'll be there in two and a half hours.
2715760	2720800	We're a bit short tonight. It's a great, great day for multi-car racing.
2721440	2723200	All right. What were you going to say, Jeff? Sorry.
2726480	2730880	Do you find that I took an accident workshop in commerce. We should talk about that.
2731680	2735040	We should talk about that. Did you hear me? Did you really?
2735040	2737600	Yeah. Well, I didn't take it. They gave it to me.
2739680	2743200	They thought that I would be better at improv if I knew how to say it's a great,
2743200	2746400	great day for multi-car racing. Every time someone said Scottish.
2746400	2751280	So you're Jackie Stewart. Yeah. I'm, I'm, yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a wort on Rich Little's taint.
2754880	2758400	His taint was pretty smooth. Yeah. That's the irony.
2758400	2759360	I think we already tried.
2763280	2767760	The actual irony is Rich Little's taint, incredibly distinctive,
2767760	2772560	resembled no one else's taint to the world. A unique and singular taint.
2773520	2777840	A master impressionist. But that's his taint was just, it was only his.
2777840	2783760	God broke the mold, but no one could ever know. And that's why when virtual reality gets
2783760	2788560	advanced enough, we will be able to stand in his taint and look around.
2788560	2793600	This is Rich Little's taint. That's not a day I look forward to talking.
2794160	2801840	What you were speaking of before, I could thrill to. But you guys travel ever. You travel, right?
2801840	2805280	Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. But you don't like traveling much, Dan, do you?
2805280	2807760	So me and Jeff, I think are kind of addicted to travel.
2807920	2816320	I think with my mouth, and so I've only been out of the English hegemony zone once. I was in Paris,
2816320	2820240	where they still speak a ton of English. Of course. Or at least three pounds of it.
2820240	2829760	And I was immediately, as I would have predicted, very uncomfortable. I roll with it. But the truth
2829760	2836080	is, I'm walking around Paris and I was like, I just feel absolutely useless and crippled.
2836080	2842880	It's my fault because I took two years of French, but didn't take two years of French.
2844640	2851360	Every other country in the world speaks two languages. And the Eiffel Tower looks like a
2851360	2858320	big thing. Great. But I loved Dublin because they spoke something that I could decipher.
2858320	2860800	I've learned something from Greg. Greg and I have traveled around the world a bit,
2861840	2865600	a few countries that don't speak English. And Greg has this great thing. Greg actually keeps a
2867040	2873040	book with paper in it. And he writes notes down. And he's little pages of... What a cock.
2875440	2877360	He writes down notes if you... Paper.
2880880	2886800	Cast your mind. It's a surface with the pinch zoom function disabled.
2888800	2892480	Speaking of which, Greg and I, you and I, we were stuck in San Luis Obispo airport
2892560	2896960	for eight hours. And this little tiny airport with one plane that didn't show up.
2896960	2900240	And there was a... I think I might have talked about this on the show before,
2900240	2904560	but there was a toddler walking around and haranguing everybody. And everybody wanted
2904560	2908960	to murder this child. But you can't because you're in an airport in 9-11 and you can't.
2910160	2917040	That's the reason you can't. The reason you can't is 9-11. God damn that 9-11. In the old days,
2917040	2921440	you could fucking Patriot Act. You could smoke on the plane and you could throttle a child.
2922640	2927120	Thank you. And the good old days. And you got off of fucking Hawaii and the Hawaiian Airlines
2927120	2931600	and they gave you a lay and it was sexy and it was good. But now you can't kill a three-year-old.
2931600	2935920	But the little baby had like a news week and we were all... There was nothing to do in this
2935920	2940880	plane wouldn't fucking show. And there was a baby and we heard this laughter behind this.
2940880	2947280	And this toddler was looking at a magazine and it was trying to iPad it. It was trying to swipe.
2947280	2952880	Wow. And the baby hadn't mastered page turning technology. He couldn't understand why he was
2952880	2958560	moving his hand across a thing and the surface wasn't changing the image. And everybody laughed
2958560	2966400	and I wanted to just vomit tears. To be fair, to be fucking fair though, not a single person. Don't
2966400	2971680	be fair. Don't coddle this child, Harmon. No, just to bring back perspective so that we don't
2971680	2977200	feel like the world is falling apart because of that. Because that makes me feel queasy too. But
2977200	2982720	then you have to remember that not a single person in this room... I say that now. I'm going
2982720	2985600	to make one guy's going to stand up and say, I know how to do it. But not a single person.
2985600	2987440	I know how to do it. Sorry.
2987440	2995200	Not a single person in this room can make a piece of paper out of a log. That is technology. We are
2995200	3002640	as beholden to the guy that invented paper as we are to Steve Jobs. Jobs, Job. Or Job.
3003440	3009920	The technology... We build on it, build on it, build on it. 40% of this audience is wearing
3009920	3016800	eyeglasses. 100% of this audience speaks in alphabet that was invented after. It's a mimetic
3016800	3024720	society. It's a genetic one. Otherwise, we'd be fucking lions or ants. That kid that doesn't know
3024720	3030560	how to turn a page and may never turn a page, he could end up being president of Earth.
3030560	3038240	And he did in a futuristic episode I wrote. And then I had to kill his mother so he wouldn't
3038240	3047200	be born in case he made peace that didn't defeat Kim Jong-un. It's a lot like that Harlan Ellis
3047200	3048400	in the Star Trek episode.
3050080	3056480	I learned from Greg. Greg, we were in Sarajevo. That's right. We were in Yugoslavia or the former
3056560	3058320	republic of Yugoslavia. Whatever the fuck we were.
3058320	3059040	Phyrom.
3059040	3061520	Yeah. That was Macedonia, right?
3061520	3062160	Oh, yeah, right.
3062160	3063920	You guys went to Phyrom?
3063920	3064640	Phyrom, yeah.
3064640	3069600	And we went to... God, what was that horrible... Macedonia was really bad.
3069600	3070320	Kosovo.
3070320	3073120	Kosovo, yeah. Are the citizens of Phyrom called...
3073120	3073680	Thyroids?
3075360	3075760	Yes.
3075760	3080720	It's Phyrom, the former Yugoslavian republic of Macedonia. But Greg has a little piece of paper
3080720	3085120	and he writes it down. All the pleases and thank yous. Hello, how do you do? Sorry, good day.
3085280	3088560	And you write those things down and you don't have to know everything when you travel to a
3088560	3092320	foreign place. If you walk in, you go, dobradone. And they go like...
3092320	3093200	Dobavece.
3093200	3099520	Yeah. And they freak out. And Greg's like... I use that all the time. Whenever I go anywhere,
3099520	3102240	I make sure I know how to say all the polite things that you can walk...
3102240	3104160	Because we learned how to stay... What is it?
3105360	3105840	Stima.
3105840	3106320	Yeah.
3106320	3108480	Stima.
3108480	3112640	I did a show in... Which means like what's up, kind of. Like what's happening in like
3113120	3114480	Croatia, Serbo-Croatian.
3115760	3120800	And so I was in Chicago, I did a gig with Lucia Vavum and I met some people and they took me to
3120800	3126800	a club and it was run by these giant Eastern European guys who hated my guts on site. They
3126800	3130800	just like... I went with this girl who they knew and they didn't like me at all, but they were...
3130800	3135760	I'm 6'4", kind of. They were like 6'7", a giant hockey player looking dudes in suits and they
3135760	3140800	wanted to murder me. And they were either Serbian or Croatian, but you can't guess wrong on that one.
3142640	3143760	Like if you think on an option.
3143760	3147600	Yeah. If you think like guessing wrong in like Kiwi versus Aussie, like that's... No.
3148240	3151440	Or like, you know, Japanese and Chinese. They love that.
3151440	3151920	Yeah. No.
3153440	3154720	Like, no, no, you got it wrong.
3154720	3156000	Same difference. Yeah.
3156560	3160800	These guys hated my guts. They were giants and they just were like just glowering at me.
3160800	3166640	And I went up to one of them and they wouldn't let me buy a drink. They wanted me out of there.
3166640	3172320	It was really like... They were being really hostile and strange. And I said, are you Croatian?
3172320	3177600	Just guessed. I had a 50-50 on it. And he goes, I mean, assuming I was even right about that,
3178160	3180800	because his name was like Draco. Or something like that.
3180800	3182080	Gragulla, yeah.
3183200	3184160	I will bury you.
3184160	3188240	His name was Milos or something like that. I said, are you Croatian? And he goes,
3189040	3196240	big long pause. It felt like about a minute. And he was like, yes. And I went, because of Greg,
3196240	3200080	I went, staima. And he goes, what the fuck?
3204000	3205360	You know what your answer to staima is?
3207360	3209680	Nothing special. Nothing special, man.
3209680	3211920	Are you saying you learned how to say no worries, bro?
3211920	3213200	Yeah. Yes. Yes.
3214800	3216320	He went over to his buddies and he goes,
3221120	3225200	I could not get my wallet out of my pocket. They would not let me leave the club.
3225200	3227040	Drinks were on them for the rest of the night.
3227040	3229680	They took they took your wallet out of your pocket.
3229680	3231440	No, no, they wouldn't let me get my wallet.
3231440	3232000	Oh, okay.
3233440	3236160	They pulled my pants down. They put their penises in my asshole.
3237040	3241440	I had the story with nothing to worry about.
3241440	3243440	There were there were such friendly racist.
3244960	3247600	Long story short, they fucked me. They fucked me into the dirt.
3248320	3249920	That's what we learned in Game of Thrones. Yeah.
3249920	3256160	I'll fuck you into the dirt. That episode almost went fucking.
3256160	3257680	You know what we do to runners, don't you?
3259120	3262000	I don't tell me you, you, you bring them back. I said,
3262000	3264560	fucking to fuck you into dirt. What the what?
3265280	3268640	No, not fuck you into dirt. We're going to fuck you into the dirt.
3268640	3270400	Oh, they're not going to make you dirt.
3270400	3272560	I missed this episode. What is, what is that?
3272560	3273280	I lost.
3274240	3276720	That was two episodes ago. Do you watch Game of Thrones?
3276720	3277120	No.
3277120	3278080	Oh, fuck man.
3278080	3279680	Do they fuck people in the dirt?
3279760	3282240	No, they didn't, but they threatened to fuck a guy into the dirt.
3282240	3284240	And then spoilers. This is two episodes ago.
3284240	3287600	But, uh, yeah, then a guy came along and shot a bunch of dudes with arrows.
3287600	3290480	And uh, but at one point I'm going to fuck you into the dirt.
3290480	3294080	I was like, Jesus, that's, that's saying a lot.
3294080	3294880	But don't say it. Yeah.
3294880	3298000	Don't say too much because there are some people that will be a couple episodes behind.
3298000	3302880	But, but I, I, I, I swear to God, like Greg, you've watched you.
3302880	3305200	I fucking went into, did we talk about this in the show?
3305840	3309040	I, Greg and I were doing a gig at our, at a casino and I'm
3309040	3311360	wandering around in the daytime. The show is not until night.
3312080	3315120	I, I walked by and there's Greg sitting at a slot machine.
3315840	3318080	And he's sitting there like, like a little old lady.
3319760	3321600	His legs are crossed. He's been there for a while.
3321600	3323520	And it was the Sex and the City slot machine.
3326160	3326640	Oh yeah.
3326640	3329200	And I almost, I almost disowned you as a friend.
3330720	3332960	I'm not gay and I make no case for it.
3332960	3334640	It was the best slot machine.
3335200	3337120	I won a couple hundred off that fucker too.
3340000	3340640	They'd go like.
3344000	3346080	Samantha has to pick a pair of shoes.
3348160	3349760	And they're like, which shoes will it be?
3349760	3353600	And I'm like, Oh God, the pumps or the fucking sling box and shit.
3355200	3356160	Sling box.
3356160	3357680	And then wing, wing, wing, wing, wing.
3357680	3360400	And then Mr. Big would go, nice choice.
3360400	3374880	All right, wait, let's, let's, uh, let's get Spencer up here and play some Dungeons and Dragons.
3377040	3384880	Spencer Crittenden, summon yourself from the Imperial plane.
3385600	3387200	Dungeon master to the stars.
3387520	3390320	There's no chair.
3392080	3394000	I'll stand. I'll sit.
3394000	3397680	He walks to the black table, his beard wagging,
3397680	3401040	his community t-shirt, making Dan Harmon feel sad.
3404320	3407280	It's not, I can't wear blue shirts to work.
3407280	3409760	Cause when I'm leaving people will be like, help me.
3409760	3413280	And I'm like, no, he works at the Apple store.
3413280	3418000	Right. But isn't that your fantasy as a, as a, as a back rumor?
3418000	3420240	No, because they'd still be mistaken.
3420240	3422560	And then they'd be like, Oh, that guy didn't help.
3422560	3423120	Oh man.
3424480	3427920	When I worked in food service, I worked in the dish room and then they promoted me
3427920	3431680	to work the front line of the rehab center where I was doing dishes.
3431680	3435680	And I, and I, they, my raise was a quarter an hour.
3435680	3441360	And I, after a week, I, I, I went to the manager and I said, I want to wash dishes again.
3441360	3444000	I can't like, like I can't deal with the people.
3445040	3446320	That was my whole thing.
3446320	3446880	Yeah.
3446880	3448800	Worst. Like I thought it was going to be a dream.
3448800	3451520	Like, Oh, instead of washing the dishes, I get to make the dishes dirty.
3451520	3453520	I get to put their mashed potatoes on the plate.
3454960	3456400	But you have to talk to the people.
3456400	3458800	Their psychological dishes were not done.
3461840	3465040	And if you would point that out, a counselor would say, that's inappropriate.
3465840	3466960	It's not inappropriate.
3466960	3468560	And you don't have a psychology degree.
3468560	3472560	You're a fucking counselor at a private rehab center that's draining insurance money.
3473200	3475600	And then you're sending anorexics home.
3475600	3479360	I've been putting polycos in their apple juice for six months
3479360	3480480	and their insurance ran out.
3480480	3482080	They're walking home a human skeleton.
3482080	3483600	What is polycos?
3483600	3487840	It's a, it's a, it's a fattener that they use to keep anorexics from dying
3487840	3490080	while they suck their bank accounts dry.
3490080	3490400	Wow.
3490400	3495280	Anyways, I, I'm going to write a letter to a 1993 senator.
3495440	3499840	That's going to shut that place down again.
3499840	3503200	Why don't you write a movie like Upton Sinclair, that shit fucking blow the lid off.
3503200	3505120	Because I'm sure that everything's changed now.
3505120	3508320	Did the anorexics know that you're putting this into their apple juice?
3508320	3509440	No, they did not, sir.
3509440	3510560	No, they did not.
3510560	3513600	Instead of polyglots, I eat a lot of racist pieces.
3517440	3518800	Sometimes Oreo bins.
3518800	3521920	They would, I was, I was in charge of like,
3521920	3525200	I would have to watch the, the, the people from the anorexic unit.
3525920	3528160	They would, because they had an open cafeteria,
3528160	3532640	they would, they would hide their jello behind the juice machine.
3532640	3537120	And I had to go as an 18 year old pimply-faced guy with a rat tail.
3537120	3540160	I was in charge of going, hey Veronica, come on.
3540160	3542160	Hey, say you put your jello behind.
3544560	3545760	Hey, come on.
3545760	3549360	I'm making $3 and 75 cents an hour.
3549360	3551840	Which was a raise from the $3 and 50 cents.
3552640	3557520	That I raced back to after one, one week on the, on the line, as we called it.
3557520	3558880	But they drank the apple.
3558880	3559840	They would drink out.
3559840	3562880	Is that a thing where they, they would drink the, like anorexics?
3562880	3563440	They drink the juice.
3563440	3564720	They think it's just apple juice.
3564720	3568880	I'm dumping like fucking like turkey, liquid turkey stuffing in it.
3568880	3574000	Invisible, odorless, flavorless, uh, uh, uh, caloric booster in it.
3574000	3576080	Which is their nightmare.
3576080	3579440	It's, it's, it's like curing a conspiracy theorist
3579440	3582160	by getting together with the government.
3585840	3587840	It's not, it can't be healthy.
3588960	3592160	It's, it's a, it's their fantasy come true.
3592160	3597200	If they find out, because I was like, do they know we're putting fucking fat in their apple juice
3597200	3602240	to keep their bodies from dying while you have them draw pictures of themselves and finger paint?
3602240	3603520	Um, no, they don't.
3603520	3606800	And we'd really appreciate it if you keep a lid on that.
3606800	3608640	Like you keep a lid on the mayonnaise.
3608720	3612720	Ah, ah, you minimum wage just food service worker.
3612720	3616640	Thanks for helping us with people's brains for a living.
3621600	3625440	Uh, let's play some D and D.
3628640	3629600	How you been Spencer?
3630480	3632880	How am I, what's new in, uh, Kriten-dom.
3632880	3634400	Uh, Kriten-dom.
3635200	3636400	Kriten-dom.
3636400	3637360	I don't know, man.
3637520	3639920	Um, uh, nothing.
3640560	3643440	I don't, yeah, yeah, no, yeah, yeah.
3643440	3645600	You know, we, we started playing, I think we spoke about this.
3645600	3650080	We started an actual D and D campaign at Dan's crib.
3650080	3650480	Yeah.
3650480	3654480	Whereas non, you know, non televised, non, uh, non podcasted.
3654480	3656240	And, uh, I'm very excited about it.
3656240	3658080	I wore a little costume last time and no one else did.
3659280	3662240	Turns out you're not supposed to wear a costume to, uh.
3662240	3662880	Yeah, you are.
3663600	3665200	You, yes, please keep doing.
3665360	3669440	My costume is on a rack and on a hanger for tomorrow night.
3669440	3671440	Yeah, don't, don't, don't stop.
3671440	3675040	I went into a thrift store because I went, I went to go buy a little, uh,
3675040	3677280	I went to a stationary store because I wanted like a little notebook.
3677280	3679600	So I walked in there and there was kind of a, you know,
3679600	3683920	kind of a nerdy dude working at the, at the mailboxes or whatever the place was.
3684720	3686560	I go, do you have any blank books or journals?
3686560	3687520	And he's like, yeah, we got some over here.
3687520	3688080	I got some over there.
3688080	3691920	I go, I'm looking for one, um, I'm playing D and D.
3691920	3692960	He goes, right this way.
3693360	3698400	And I was like, oh, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the jazz right there.
3698400	3700480	And then, so we're talking about this and I got some,
3700480	3704160	I got some post-it notes and I got my little folder to put my, my, my character sheet in.
3704160	3704960	I was very excited about it.
3704960	3708720	I felt like the first day of school and next door to the place is a thrift store.
3708720	3710000	And I went to the ladies section.
3710000	3715200	It turns out, uh, you can get a nice little, uh, halfling robe costume in there.
3716000	3718000	I came out, nobody wanted to help me.
3718000	3718880	They were so bummed up.
3718880	3722240	Like, uh, I told all the girls, all the hipster girls at Brooklyn, like,
3722560	3726240	look, I'm playing D and D. I'm a halfling rogue and I'd like, uh, you know,
3726240	3729600	something maybe like a little vest or like they didn't give a shit.
3729600	3732080	But then I came out in my outfit and they were like, that's the stuff.
3734000	3734800	Are you going to dress up?
3735840	3736400	Yes. Yes.
3736400	3738400	Anything to support this gateway that you're going through.
3741680	3744960	I want you to, I want you to end up where you want to end up.
3745760	3748960	If you need me to, no, I want, I want to dress up too.
3748960	3753360	I was at your place half hour before you came home and you were at the table rolling dice
3753360	3754800	and looking at your book and doing stuff.
3754800	3758160	And we'd spoken a few times before you realized that I was wearing a costume.
3758160	3758640	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
3758640	3760240	I mean, you were, yeah, I only saw it.
3760240	3760880	All right.
3760880	3765200	But let's get Aaron out here and, uh, uh, McGathey.
3765200	3766800	Aaron McGathey to the stage.
3766800	3767600	Aaron McGathey.
3770320	3772080	The return of Mulrain Sedana.
3772880	3781200	I'm glad you could take time out of your busy cake making schedule.
3781200	3784000	I was talking about a cake making with Danielle.
3784000	3788160	Like I almost couldn't be bothered to come out because I was talking about my cake tips.
3789120	3790720	I made a cake for Duncan for his birthday.
3790720	3791840	It was amazing.
3791840	3800000	I've been eating it by myself in my house, just scooping big chunks of chocolate cake and watching
3800880	3801440	birds.
3803840	3804960	But it's still, it was delicious.
3804960	3807520	How long does it take to make a cake like that?
3807520	3808480	Four days, four days.
3809520	3810080	No, not really.
3810080	3810960	No, I love it.
3812960	3816160	It takes, well, I've learned how to, how to multitask.
3816160	3820240	So it takes, uh, it takes 30 minutes for the cake to bake in the oven.
3820240	3822960	And it takes about four minutes for me to mix.
3822960	3823440	I use it.
3823440	3824160	I use a mix.
3824160	3824880	I use a box.
3826320	3828080	Well, I never said otherwise.
3828960	3831040	I'm just doing it because I like decorating my cake.
3831840	3837920	I, if I really, we have really thrones night at my place, our place every, uh, week.
3837920	3841360	And you, you've like, we're three weeks in a row.
3841360	3843840	Now you started with a dinklage that looked like Cobain.
3843840	3847200	Then it was, then it was a Jon Snow that looked a lot like Jon Snow.
3847200	3853200	And last night your cake, your game of thrones cake had the, uh, what's your name?
3853200	3853920	The dragon lady.
3853920	3859360	Daenerys, uh, looking like man, looking like, like you're getting.
3859360	3861440	Well, I bought, I bought some fondant.
3861440	3862720	Who loves fondant?
3865360	3866880	What is fondant?
3866880	3871120	Fondant is, uh, it's like sugar, sugar clays, clay made out of sugar.
3871120	3871680	It's what I use.
3871680	3875520	It's a hagiographic, uh, sucrose form of sugar.
3875520	3875760	Yeah.
3875760	3876160	Yeah.
3876160	3880560	You give it to anorexics and they don't know they're being fed.
3880560	3881680	Yeah.
3881680	3884480	All right, Dan, will you, uh, dispense the character sheets?
3884480	3885520	I would be glad to.
3885520	3886240	Thank you, sir.
3886960	3890640	Tonight Duncan will be portraying Kumail's, uh, character, Christopher.
3890640	3890800	Yeah.
3890800	3891600	You're Christopher.
3891600	3893760	You wrote the song lady in red and performed it.
3893760	3894080	Okay.
3894080	3895520	He's a human rogue thief.
3895520	3896240	What does he Spencer?
3896240	3897600	He's a human rogue.
3900080	3901600	Spencer, I love when you're in character.
3902480	3902960	Yeah.
3902960	3903600	I love it.
3903600	3908800	The thing is, the thing nobody realizes is I'm always a character.
3908800	3909440	You are.
3909520	3910640	I just switch it up.
3912240	3913040	It's not funny.
3913040	3914000	It's not meant to be funny.
3914000	3915120	That's the honest truth.
3916400	3917600	Again, not funny.
3917600	3918080	Thank you.
3919760	3920560	That time it was funny.
3920560	3923200	It's not that you become a, when you start dungeon mastering,
3923200	3924480	you don't become a different Spencer.
3924480	3927200	You just become a more, more resonance.
3927200	3929520	You become a little bit more mellifluous.
3929520	3930320	Yes, I do.
3932160	3935840	Can I, can I carve a message into my skin for Kumail the next time?
3936400	3940960	Yeah, do like fuck with him for sure.
3944320	3944800	Great.
3945920	3949120	I mean, there's a lot of like, yeah, whatever, whatever.
3949120	3949280	Yeah.
3949280	3950480	It's like phone jacking.
3950480	3951920	Like, this is great.
3951920	3956000	Like whenever Aaron's not here, Jeff fucks something that Aaron owns.
3956880	3957920	It happened one time.
3959520	3961200	Last time I fucked and murdered a spider.
3962080	3963520	That was fucking weird.
3963600	3966720	And I mean, it was, as I, I listened to that and it was like,
3966720	3968240	that was as weird as I remembered it.
3971440	3973280	A guy turned into a spider.
3973280	3981040	Now it was my fault, but, but, but, and we, and we brutalized it out of self-defense slash.
3981040	3982560	And then it attacked us.
3982560	3987040	And then it was trying, you guys kept trying to bring it back to life and make friends with it.
3987040	3993440	And you had, I put a blanket over his head because I thought we were going to have
3994000	3994400	kill it.
3994400	3995760	And I was like, I'm sorry.
3995760	3996960	We did this to you.
3996960	4000160	You had sex with it and whispered in its ear.
4001600	4003120	We're going to let you live.
4005920	4008240	But he did that while the spider was asleep.
4009760	4013280	But there, there were some circuitous conditional statement.
4013280	4015680	We're going to let you live, but I'm going to fuck you every night.
4015680	4016960	I'm going to fuck you every night.
4017840	4019280	And then you killed it.
4022000	4022960	Ted Bundy.
4023120	4029040	I was putting, I was, I was, it was a commentary on the chaos that had, that had, that had
4029040	4029920	preceded that.
4029920	4033440	It was a commentary on the, we kept, we kept hurting it and then trying to save it,
4033440	4034720	hurting it and trying to save it.
4034720	4037120	So I fucked it, told it, I was going to fuck it forever.
4037120	4038240	And then,
4038240	4040080	are we actually playing now?
4042800	4044720	I mean, you can call it a commentary.
4044720	4046560	You became the BTK killer.
4049360	4050400	I'm a barbarian.
4050400	4051280	He's misunderstood.
4051280	4052640	I'm a barbarian, Dan.
4053200	4055920	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm whimsical.
4055920	4056320	All right.
4057440	4059360	Spencer, if you would get us up to speed.
4060560	4064800	When we last met, our heroes were following the mysterious wanderer,
4064800	4070960	Brefi, into a web-slung stand of black pillars on the mysterious and dark shadow plane.
4071840	4076320	Immediately after fleeing a forest fire set off by Sharpie's fireball, the wizard,
4077760	4082160	the wizard blasted the new webby obstacle, the shreds with a second fireball.
4083200	4088320	Upon doing this, Brefi fell to his knees and began shape-shifting into a monstrosity.
4088320	4091200	After a brief discussion, the gang left into action.
4091200	4095760	Moraine fired arrows and Quark detached three limbs with a single critical strike.
4095760	4098400	Then a monkey was summoned or her fiend to shape or something.
4098960	4103520	Krista Berg sued the savage Brefi, who surrendered rather anticlimactically.
4103520	4107200	Feeling the intense bloodlust from the unsatisfying and peaceful end of combat,
4107200	4110080	the barbarian expressed himself in the only way he could.
4110080	4111680	Violence and sexual deviance.
4113680	4117520	After promising the clearly unconscious shape-shifter his life would be spared,
4117520	4121520	Quark drove his sword directly through the spider's skull, mid-coitus,
4121520	4124480	bringing an end to his miserable, tormented life.
4124480	4129120	But with their guide and the only ally they had on the shadow plane murdered,
4129120	4131840	how would they recover their shadows and return home?
4132800	4133680	Spencer!
4133680	4134180	Yes!
4135840	4136340	Shit.
4136340	4142980	I stand by my actions.
4143700	4145140	I stand by my actions.
4147860	4149940	You were only cleaning up a mess I made.
4151780	4156420	I experienced the, you know, I was feeling like we had been moving too slowly,
4156420	4159140	like I, so I started casting fireball everywhere.
4159860	4160900	Yeah, you were willy-nilly.
4161780	4163940	It made sense given the circumstances.
4163940	4167620	You wouldn't have known, you know, you were trying to make momentum.
4168420	4168900	I don't know.
4169620	4170020	Whatever.
4170820	4171300	Shut up!
4172260	4174980	Okay, so what's the state of affairs around us right now?
4174980	4179300	Well, right now I should at first mention, Sharpie, you're out of level three spells.
4179300	4181140	So you have level one and two spells left,
4181140	4184580	but you have to like sleep a whole night before you regain your level three spells.
4184580	4185700	But I'm level five.
4185700	4186340	That's true.
4186900	4188340	I don't have any level five spells?
4188340	4189380	No, it's weird.
4189380	4190580	It's like, you're weird.
4191380	4195380	I would never deny that.
4195380	4197700	The answer to your question, Greg, is never.
4198580	4198980	What?
4198980	4201140	I said the answer to your question is never.
4201140	4201620	Thank you.
4201620	4201620	
4202820	4204420	Okay, there's only two answers.
4204420	4208020	Once, if you're in the Navy, and two never.
4209540	4212340	That was one of those moments where no one else is thinking the same thing you are.
4212340	4214340	Well, because you asked when we were starting,
4214340	4216180	and I was sitting here nervous that you were unhappy.
4216180	4216660	Never.
4216660	4217940	No, I'm not unhappy at all.
4217940	4219220	I'm ecstatic.
4219220	4220340	Oh, did you have a heart out?
4220420	4221460	Did you need to go?
4221460	4222020	No.
4222020	4222740	No, no.
4222740	4223700	Sorry, sorry.
4223700	4226020	I adore to smoke some pot, but we'll wait.
4226020	4226660	Me too.
4227380	4227860	Thank you.
4228900	4231220	If we had a vaporizer, we could do it right indoors.
4232660	4235300	Thanks to the young woman who played molarion last week.
4236020	4236580	It was great.
4236580	4237140	She fired two arrows.
4237140	4238020	Oh, hello.
4238020	4239140	Hi, how are you?
4240340	4241140	Good, all right.
4241140	4241700	Sorry.
4241700	4243300	What was your name again, young lady?
4243300	4243860	Stephanie.
4243860	4245780	Yeah, she fired two arrows and...
4245780	4246340	Correct.
4250900	4252660	All right, Spencer, I examine the surroundings.
4252660	4257300	Standing in the burned ruins of the Ebon thicket, you survey your surroundings.
4257300	4261300	The burned webs are slick and shiny on the remains of the crumbled pillars,
4261300	4263220	burned by spent fireballs.
4263220	4266340	You've created a pretty large clearing from all the fire,
4266340	4270900	and where before was a large vision obscuring barrier of webbing.
4270900	4272660	You can now see clearly.
4272660	4279300	And through the gap, you can see a Ripley waving mass, far off in the distance.
4279300	4282420	But to the south, you hear the approaching of hooves.
4282420	4283220	Oh, shit.
4294740	4297220	Tylenol with codeine, what are you doing here?
4304340	4306260	Oh, and I go from ranks to...
4306260	4309060	By the flaming balls of Kathy Lee Gifford.
4310260	4316660	Once again, I find myself in your company, for my entire forest has been decimated.
4316660	4319140	Burned to the ground, says I.
4320180	4323700	What villains are these who would come to my homeland?
4323700	4328100	The place where I was folded, the place where my horn did grow.
4329460	4332660	I am, of course, a unicorn and therefore immortal,
4332660	4336260	but the place where I did once stride upon my four legs.
4336580	4341860	Unbelievably, has now been rendered useless,
4341860	4344660	and I find myself in another dimension.
4344660	4350900	This one with you, greetings, hail, and salutations, says I.
4357620	4358580	Word up.
4358660	4359540	Word up.
4362740	4366340	Yo, pretty ladies around the world.
4370900	4372740	I see that thou art gathered,
4373460	4376820	and thou art still as ugly and hunched as I remembered,
4378020	4381380	whilst I remain beautiful pristine white
4381380	4384580	with a golden horn that spiralleth toward the heaven.
4384580	4387460	Tylenol, how come ye to the shadow plane?
4388020	4390580	The shadow place I must cometh to,
4390580	4395460	in order that the place where I am frometh is burned fucketh down.
4398980	4401300	I feel like, I feel like I might have done that.
4403140	4403940	To be serious?
4405380	4406580	It was an ascident.
4408100	4410660	Thou art my brother, did we not swear?
4410660	4413780	I swore, I didn't, we're on a shadow plane,
4413780	4415700	I think I cast fireball,
4415700	4419780	and I think things we do here made it affect other places.
4419780	4420580	Made of poo-poo.
4420580	4424020	Surely, twas not malfeasance on thine part.
4424900	4425400	Aye.
4427460	4427960	Aye.
4428740	4432500	You will find that within a unicorn beateth two things.
4432500	4435700	One, a member extravagant and wild.
4437620	4441300	And two, a heart that encompassth all.
4441300	4444420	Forgiveness I bestow upon all of thee,
4444420	4446180	for destroying the land I am from.
4450420	4450900	Thank you.
4451540	4453620	Tylenol, we've lost our shadows.
4453620	4455220	Our shadows are ripped apart from us,
4455220	4457940	and they've ran off into the middle darkness.
4457940	4459060	The fuck thou say?
4461540	4463620	The fuck, the fuck I don't say.
4464980	4466820	Shadows not have thee?
4466820	4470100	No, we're in the shadow plane, they up and ran.
4470100	4472420	Inconvenient most, I find this.
4474260	4476900	Even in the brightness of thine noon day,
4476900	4480100	find thou no shadow to follow thee upon the ground?
4481220	4481780	No.
4481780	4483140	Guys, I don't feel good.
4485700	4487700	I don't feel like myself.
4487700	4489060	Christopher, what is it?
4489060	4491300	I don't know, I just, I don't really,
4491940	4493940	I think I have some form of amnesia,
4493940	4496420	perhaps in this battle something happened to me,
4496420	4499940	because I have this compulsion at this moment
4500820	4504100	to start slicing off my own fingers.
4504100	4504820	Oh my God.
4507540	4508100	Don't do it.
4511220	4513860	Oh, Jolie of Angelina from the 90s.
4515540	4517220	Thou art but a cutter.
4517220	4520260	Yes, it's cutting, you know, I just, I want to carve.
4520260	4521540	I mean, I'm going to just show you guys,
4521540	4523140	I can't get this thought out of my mind.
4523140	4524980	I'm just going to carve it into my arm,
4525060	4527380	and then we'll get back to find our shadows.
4527940	4531780	So I pull out my dagger, wipe the poison off,
4531780	4533460	and I carve into my arm.
4533460	4534820	Wipe that poison dagger.
4542500	4545780	I carve into my arm something very strange
4545780	4548340	that doesn't make sense probably to any of us.
4548340	4549940	I carve into my arm.
4549940	4554100	How can you have a video game podcast
4554100	4556420	and not play Skook Darkcraft 2?
4560260	4560980	Wow.
4560980	4561460	Wow.
4562420	4565460	That's some strange, strange cryptic.
4565460	4566660	I don't know what it means.
4568660	4570020	I just wanted to do it.
4571700	4573300	Parochial thy vent.
4573300	4578340	I have horn plus 11 and 1d8 plus 10 damage.
4578340	4579780	Can I help in that respect?
4579780	4581540	You could stab them with your horn.
4582580	4583300	It wouldn't help.
4583300	4583940	It would hurt.
4584900	4586900	Stab me with your horn, unicorn.
4588260	4590900	Since thou demandeth it, shall I yes?
4590900	4591460	Yes.
4591460	4591940	Snorf.
4593780	4597380	Snorf is the noise that maketh when my horn doth stab it
4597380	4598020	then to thine.
4599700	4600180	Sharp.
4601940	4603460	Somehow satisfying.
4603460	4605140	Honing for many days have I been.
4608340	4608820	Me too.
4609540	4612820	Chris, may I offer up my bedroll
4612820	4615940	and some flint and steel so you may write a note?
4616740	4618420	No, I already carved it into my arm.
4620100	4621060	The damage is gone.
4621060	4622500	I could use a bandage.
4622500	4624740	I'm bleeding a little bit, but it's there.
4624740	4626500	I think it's going to scar permanently.
4626500	4628660	That's on me permanently.
4628660	4629700	You guys stop.
4629700	4632020	This shadow plane is driving us insane.
4632020	4635140	Spencer, how far off is that shimmering wavy thing up ahead?
4635140	4637220	It's about 50 feet away.
4637220	4640340	There's a couple pillars in front of it, obscuring it,
4640340	4642420	but it's mostly in plain view.
4642580	4645140	I hop astride Tylenol with codeine, and I say,
4645140	4647860	on Tylenol to the shimmery mass.
4647860	4650580	Oh, barbarian, thou hast mounted me once again.
4651460	4654180	And fulfill, do I feel, prance, prance,
4654180	4655700	toward the light, do I thine.
4656260	4660500	Follow closely, shall ye, even you with moderate wounds,
4660500	4662500	that I shall heal because I have the power.
4662500	4664660	Don't heal, don't heal, doesn't need healing.
4664660	4665460	Okay, fuck it.
4667060	4669300	Needs no healing, oh kind unicorn.
4669540	4672740	Oh, thou masochist, I will let thy wallow in thy pain.
4674180	4676900	Skip, skip, and prance, and here we are.
4676900	4679220	You appeared, or you head towards
4679220	4681060	the undulating black barrier.
4681620	4684980	It wavers in ripples slowly, like a massive black ooze.
4684980	4685940	I'll say.
4685940	4689300	But appears to be the, steady boy, steady.
4689300	4692100	Steady, steady.
4692100	4694820	But appears to be in the shape of a massive iron,
4694820	4698100	or wrought iron fence made out of thick, shifting shadows.
4698180	4699700	I shove my arm in it.
4699700	4700820	You shove your arm in it.
4702820	4703780	Sweet Maria.
4703780	4705540	Are you trying to kill Camille's character?
4708580	4710420	Your arm, like, into the shadow part,
4710420	4712020	or the space between the shadow part?
4712020	4713860	Now I feel bad, I don't do it.
4714420	4716020	No, do it, just follow your heart.
4716020	4718660	I shove my arm into the shadow part.
4718660	4720660	You shove your arm into the shadow part,
4720660	4724580	and it strikes with a clang, like metal.
4724580	4725140	It's metal.
4725140	4727540	It appears that, or it sounds that way.
4727540	4728580	It doesn't appear that way.
4728580	4729860	It appears like shadows.
4730660	4732900	I shove my arm in three times, and it goes,
4732900	4734580	clang, clang, clang.
4734580	4735540	With a trolley.
4736740	4737940	Ding, ding, ding.
4737940	4738740	With a bell.
4740340	4741380	Zing, zing, zing.
4741380	4744420	Easy tellin' all, easy boy.
4744420	4747060	Not gay am I, but case not, I make for it.
4751060	4754100	Silently, you see what appears to be
4754100	4756820	several black tendrils shooting out of the ground
4756820	4758180	beneath the wall.
4759620	4762580	They connect with your feet and wrap up your arms and legs,
4762580	4763940	and you feel yourself bound.
4763940	4764980	You and Krista Berg.
4766180	4766980	Who in Krista Berg?
4767780	4768740	Quark and Krista Berg.
4768740	4771140	The ones who shoved their hands through the fence there.
4771140	4771780	Can I?
4771780	4772740	I'm trapped!
4772740	4774260	Just kill me, unicorn!
4779940	4782100	Can't I use my dodge ability to get away from that?
4782980	4783860	Not in this case,
4783860	4785860	because you were, like, reaching into it.
4785860	4788580	Don't I have any power in this instance?
4788580	4791780	You could stab someone with your heart.
4792820	4797940	Oh, those shadows that doth beleaguere my friends,
4798500	4801540	shall I point my fuckin' horn at?
4803380	4804900	Scrunch, scrunch.
4806820	4810900	Take that, oh shadow, and fucketh off into the night thee.
4812340	4815060	You strike the shadow, but it does not waver.
4815140	4815860	What the fuck?
4817780	4819140	Bad unicorn luck, doc.
4819860	4822900	So, Mulrain and Sharpie are seeing this happen,
4822900	4824260	you know, about 30 feet away.
4824260	4824820	Sharpie?
4824820	4826100	Happy Poly Lodge is.
4827460	4829540	Is Coco a shadow still?
4829540	4830500	Is she in a senior buy?
4830500	4832180	Yeah, Coco's still shadow, Coco.
4832180	4833060	You're with her.
4833060	4834420	Coco's her horse, Greg.
4834420	4838260	Does Coco feel jealous of Tylenol with Cody?
4838900	4840980	Jeff's paying Cody and a lot of attention.
4840980	4844100	Oh, well, I mean, yeah.
4846020	4847940	But you wouldn't be able to know, but look.
4847940	4849300	Coco's my horse.
4849300	4852340	And I fucked her horse once or twice.
4852340	4853380	He raped my horse.
4854500	4855220	To be sure.
4856740	4860900	All right, so it's a fence-shaped thing
4860900	4861780	that's shadowing.
4861780	4864740	It's like a shadowy fence and out of the bottom of it.
4864740	4866100	Well, I mean, you haven't.
4866980	4867780	How high is it?
4867780	4868900	It's 30 feet tall.
4868900	4870500	There's a large gate set in it.
4871460	4872660	There's a large gate set in it.
4872660	4872900	Yeah.
4872900	4874900	But if I touch it, there's gonna be tendrils on me.
4875220	4876980	I mean, you don't know that for sure.
4876980	4877380	You didn't say that.
4877380	4879620	Is this the time for the rope tracker?
4879620	4880020	What's up?
4880580	4882500	Is this a good time for my rope tracker?
4882500	4883220	Well, they are.
4883220	4884820	It is a visible fence.
4884820	4885540	Oh, I see.
4885540	4886820	I'll tell you what it's time for.
4889620	4893380	What will soon be a new favorite among my spell things?
4894020	4894660	Well, wait.
4894660	4897300	You said I have no level three spells.
4897300	4898500	No level three spells?
4898500	4898980	Yeah, man.
4898980	4900420	You run out of spells sometimes.
4900420	4902420	I motion to the Sharpie.
4902420	4904660	You can sleep for eight hours.
4904660	4905620	Sorry, what?
4905620	4906180	I'm sorry.
4906180	4910500	I motioned to Sharpie to ride over to the fence on Coco.
4910500	4911460	What do I have left?
4912100	4915060	You have all your level one and two spells, just not the level threes.
4916500	4918020	You get three of those per day.
4918980	4923140	Perhaps the shadow rope is susceptible to blood.
4923140	4930420	I bite my own tongue and spit the blood at the shadow rope.
4930420	4932100	Does it affect it at all?
4932100	4933380	Awesome thinking.
4933860	4935780	For those of you keeping track at home,
4935780	4938980	Christopher has now inflicted 18 points of damage on himself.
4940980	4942100	How many does he have left?
4942100	4943140	Wait, I don't want to die.
4944020	4948020	I would like to formally think again the young woman who played me last week.
4948020	4950580	I, however, can cure moderate wounds.
4950580	4952020	Don't bother.
4952020	4953860	There are other things to worry about.
4953860	4955380	Don't kill Kamal's character.
4955380	4956340	I'm not going to kill him.
4956340	4958260	I'm just going to drain him a bit.
4961460	4962980	I've got 50 hit points.
4963060	4964980	There's plenty left to spare.
4964980	4965780	All right, fuck it.
4966900	4981380	I seem to have found a spell under level one called
4982980	4983460	Jump!
4983460	4984100	Jump!
4984100	4984900	Jump!
4984900	4985540	Jump!
4985540	4986100	Jump!
4986100	4986180	Jump!
4986180	4987140	Casting jump.
4987140	4988020	Your legs are wrapping up.
4988020	4990180	Over 30 feet of fence.
4990180	4991140	Jump!
4991140	4991780	Jump!
4991780	4992500	Jump!
4993220	4995300	Go ahead and jump.
4995300	4995620	Right?
4995620	4997780	Over 30 feet of fence.
4998420	4999540	Over 30 feet of fence.
4999540	5002340	I see a 30 feet fence instead of 30.
5002340	5003540	That it brought up me.
5009780	5014100	And it doesn't matter that you deprive me of spells from level three.
5015620	5017460	Because I'm going to cast jump.
5019460	5021060	Might as well jump.
5021060	5021860	Jump.
5021860	5022740	Over the fence.
5025460	5026580	Zing, zing, zing.
5026580	5028500	Went my heartstrings.
5028500	5031380	From the moment I met him, I fell.
5031380	5032260	He said hello.
5036660	5037780	Oh, yeah.
5037780	5038420	That happens.
5039860	5041380	You jump over the fence.
5041380	5043220	You're now on the other side of the fence.
5045220	5046340	Sharpie, can you hear me?
5047220	5054580	Can you disentangle me and Krista Berg from these shadow tendrils?
5054580	5055940	You don't have to disentangle me.
5055940	5056740	I'll just stay here.
5056740	5057700	You guys go ahead.
5059700	5064260	Lady in red.
5064260	5069300	Well, I'm hoping that from the other side, I can get the gate open.
5069300	5070020	Oh, I see.
5070020	5071540	I didn't want to touch it from the other side.
5071540	5072180	Yeah, good idea.
5073620	5074340	Get to work, Jack.
5074340	5076020	What were you going to do there, Morin?
5076740	5078820	I was going to take my sack.
5081140	5084100	I detest when anyone even nibbles at my sack.
5085620	5086100	Steady.
5087700	5098660	I was going to take my sack and loop through some of my rope and create a shadow gate retriever.
5098660	5099160	OK.
5100180	5101700	Which does?
5101700	5104020	It gets anyone out of any kind of gate.
5104980	5107700	And I throw it at Chris.
5107700	5108020	OK.
5108020	5111620	I also say, Chris, can I have some of your stuff?
5111620	5112100	Yeah.
5112100	5112980	Which what do you want?
5112980	5113460	Yeah, sure.
5114340	5114820	Let's see.
5114820	5115300	Hold on.
5117380	5117780	You know what?
5117780	5118660	Just take it all.
5118660	5120100	You just take it all.
5120100	5123380	It seems like I've got a hold on a second.
5123380	5124180	These I'm sick.
5124180	5127060	You said you were going to weaken him, not give away all your shit.
5127060	5127860	That's weak.
5127860	5130500	That's I'm going to give you pick one thing.
5130500	5131060	One pick.
5131060	5132980	The unicorn is sensitive.
5133060	5133940	Pick one thing.
5134980	5136180	Of course, I'm sensitive.
5136180	5136980	I'm a unicorn.
5136980	5138180	You don't want any of my stuff?
5139220	5139620	What?
5139620	5141540	You don't want any of my stuff, Cody?
5143140	5144100	Nothing need I.
5145380	5146900	I am completed every moment.
5148500	5153380	I throw my sack over Chris.
5154340	5155620	It lands over Chris.
5157060	5158420	And I yank him out.
5160260	5161060	I try.
5161060	5162500	I attempt to yank him out.
5163300	5164500	Fuck Cody.
5164500	5165380	Let's see here.
5165380	5167540	That's a that's a weird thing to have happen.
5169940	5171300	His neck doesn't snap.
5174100	5177380	The bag slides off his head and you know, it doesn't nothing happens.
5179780	5180340	Sharpie.
5180340	5182980	So you are you at the gate, right?
5182980	5184420	Yeah, I go to that gate.
5184420	5188660	So now I was thinking of casting knock, but I can't tell because I think I lost
5188660	5189780	one of my spell sheets.
5189780	5191140	Yeah, I just lost it.
5191140	5195860	I can't tell if knock is a level two knocks a level two to spell.
5195860	5196340	Okay.
5196340	5199540	I was going to try to cast knock on it without touching it.
5199540	5201140	I don't want to touch this stuff.
5201140	5202420	Does it knock open?
5202420	5202900	Yeah.
5202900	5203620	Yeah.
5203620	5207220	With a loud knocking sound, knocking with a loud sound.
5208420	5210020	The gate is blasted open.
5211060	5211620	Immediately.
5211620	5214660	Your binds are dissolved and you can free your limbs again.
5214660	5215380	Thank God.
5216420	5217940	But you hear a sound behind you.
5217940	5221060	Sharpie coming out of the you know, the sound behind you.
5222100	5224180	Words, words are a thing.
5225300	5228900	I turn around and examine my surrounded bit behind me.
5228900	5231780	You see six shadow humanoids approaching.
5233460	5236180	I hold my hand up in friendly greeting.
5236180	5237620	One of them holds their hand up.
5238500	5240260	It appears to be the shape of a blade.
5240900	5241700	Wait, what?
5241700	5243380	One of them holds their hand up.
5243380	5245220	It appears to be the shape of a blade.
5245220	5247300	One of them holds their hand up.
5247300	5247540	Yeah.
5247540	5248420	What's your armor class?
5248740	5249540	Their their hand.
5250420	5251860	I'll answer that in one second.
5253460	5255860	You said their hand is the shape of a blade like
5257860	5260180	Ryan Reynolds character from the Wolverine movie.
5260980	5263060	Like, yeah.
5265060	5266340	Or they're just holding a sword.
5266900	5268260	No, it's the shape of a blade.
5268260	5269780	It's like muted into a blade.
5270740	5272420	Definitely muted into a blade.
5273300	5275460	And it strikes you dealing 12 damage.
5275940	5276660	Jesus.
5277620	5279620	My armor class, by the way, is a million.
5280820	5282900	I can cure medium wounds.
5282900	5283540	That's true.
5283540	5284580	Definitely you can.
5284580	5287460	Can I, am I able to hide in the shadows?
5289380	5290740	You can try, definitely.
5290740	5291860	Only Stevie Nicks is.
5298580	5300820	You attempt to conceal yourselves in the shadows.
5300820	5301860	Hopefully the shadowy footage will see you.
5301860	5307780	I will cure you with my medium healing wound healing powers.
5310500	5312180	Let me squat upon thine face.
5315460	5320100	And dispense the mucus that does make one whole again.
5321220	5323860	Healing 19 hit points of damage.
5323860	5325060	Whoa, to me?
5325060	5326980	Yeah, that brings you back to full health.
5326980	5327780	Oh, oh, you can.
5327780	5328340	Oh, okay.
5328340	5328900	Thank you.
5328900	5329540	Welcome back.
5329540	5331140	Your dreams where you're taken out.
5331140	5335860	Does anyone have a sheet in their stuff that has level two spells on it?
5335860	5340180	Are you fucking joking or I have a piece of fucking graphite paper here with me?
5340180	5340660	Not me.
5340660	5343300	How many of these shadow warriors are there?
5344100	5344980	There's six of them.
5345780	5348740	I fire two arrows.
5353380	5355380	You know, now you can fire three arrows.
5355380	5356260	Oh, really?
5356260	5356500	Yeah.
5356500	5357780	What did that happen?
5357780	5359140	You got a magic bow.
5359140	5359620	Whoa!
5360500	5362500	I fire three arrows.
5368820	5370820	It's not going to have been two arrows for so long.
5370820	5377540	Wait, while she fires the arrows, I quickly use my knife to pry off three of my fingernails.
5378260	5383220	And then I try to do a backstab on one of the shadow beings.
5383220	5384900	Do you hate Kameel Nanjiani?
5384900	5386020	I love Kameel.
5386020	5387380	I don't like his character.
5390580	5392420	Oh, it'd be so funny if you hate Kameel.
5392420	5395860	Two of the arrows plant themselves in the figure dealing nine damage.
5397300	5400020	At the same time, you attempt your backstab maneuver.
5401460	5403380	But it doesn't seem to go as planned.
5403380	5405140	They smile in your face.
5406260	5407540	All the time they won't take your place.
5407540	5410180	All right, so what is the arrangement of these figures?
5410180	5411860	Where are they standing in relationship to us?
5411860	5416580	There's about three that are up on Sharpie and he's inside this gate.
5416580	5418180	And you guys are outside this gate.
5418260	5420180	And then there's three farther back.
5420180	5421460	Didn't he bust the gate open?
5421460	5424500	He did from the inside, but they're farther inside.
5424500	5426100	So can I come through the gate?
5426100	5426660	Definitely.
5426660	5433220	Okay, I jump through the gate and I do a flaming sword attack on the nearest figure.
5434020	5434740	That happens.
5437140	5442660	With your flaming sword, you charge directly towards the most menacing of the shadow shapes
5442660	5449540	and the slice, an incredible slice across the dark foe dealing some damage.
5450180	5452180	Oh, that was almost off the table.
5456020	5457780	Dealing 16 damage.
5457780	5462580	Yeah, I can't wait to find out what the non-conflict resolution of this encounter would have been.
5464260	5465620	We brought you a shadow cake.
5467780	5469940	The guy had a sword for a hand, right?
5469940	5471620	The lead shadow falls.
5471620	5476820	All I did was jump over his tendril having shadow fence and open the door.
5476820	5478580	The rest of the shadows pour out.
5478580	5482100	They actually flow past Sharpie and directly towards Moraine and Chris.
5482900	5484580	May I summon a magical beast?
5485140	5486260	After this, you can.
5487700	5489060	Can I apologize?
5491060	5493060	Can I kick some mighty fucking dick?
5495700	5498420	All of those things can happen in due time, ladies and gentlemen.
5498420	5501700	Let me get some attack rolls out of the way.
5501700	5502660	It'll be a blast.
5505380	5506020	Are you okay?
5507380	5507860	No.
5510020	5511300	Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
5511300	5514500	I'm having the best time, objectively.
5517380	5523060	Anyway, two of the shadow creatures approach Moraine and Chris and strike deadly blows on
5523060	5527860	their arms and legs with their bladed limbs, dealing some damage.
5528900	5529540	Oh, shit.
5530500	5534180	Moraine takes 15 damage and Christoperg takes nine.
5535300	5540900	The other two shadows, one of their limbs become hazy and smoky like hazy and smoke.
5542020	5549700	And the smoke that they have for their now limbs flows directly into the throat of a quark,
5549700	5551140	as if attempting to strangle him.
5551140	5553540	You feel a dark presence invade your body.
5554740	5556100	Won't be the last time.
5557300	5558020	Oh, shit.
5558580	5560180	Not with that costume on.
5560180	5562980	You feel yourself choking and like it's getting harder to move,
5562980	5564420	but otherwise you're not affected.
5565140	5566740	And I mean, you're choking, but yeah.
5567540	5567940	All right.
5568900	5569620	Can I respond to that?
5570820	5571860	Who moved first?
5571860	5572820	I think it was.
5572820	5574420	I think this is Moraine's turn now.
5575540	5577620	I summon magical beast.
5577620	5582260	Okay, so you can summon some sort of magical beast with that shadow eater.
5583060	5585220	No, close, close.
5585940	5587060	Let's edit this out.
5587060	5587700	This whole thing.
5589220	5590420	She can't summon a squid.
5590420	5590900	That's the thing.
5590900	5594820	Dire rat, eagle, monkey, octopus, owl, porpoise, snake, wolf.
5595700	5596580	Porpoise.
5596580	5597780	Porpoise.
5597780	5598900	Summon the porpoise.
5600100	5601540	Summon the porpoise.
5604420	5608660	You guys always want aquatic creatures to be summoned to terrestrial space.
5609380	5611540	You really got a 4chan message board.
5612420	5614180	You just want to see suffering.
5614820	5617300	You just want to watch a creature die in front of it.
5617300	5619860	You can imagine that without us doing anything.
5621060	5622660	It's not visually happening.
5624820	5625540	I'm just explaining.
5625540	5634820	Because this creature reads to me as the most fearless and maniacal, I summon the monkey.
5637060	5637380	Nice.
5638180	5642500	With a snap of your fingers and a wave of your arms, a monkey leaps into existence.
5647780	5651060	Cover me when I sleep.
5652180	5653300	Cover me.
5654260	5654740	Nobody.
5654740	5655540	Peter Gabriel.
5655540	5656980	Don't you know any of that?
5658500	5660660	He appears as he's jumping through the air.
5660660	5666980	Yeah, he jumps like he dissolves into existence, jumping directly onto one of the shadow creatures
5666980	5670820	and is now on his head, trying to beat him or pummel him or rip his hair out.
5670820	5672420	But it's not going so well.
5672420	5673540	It's not doing any damage.
5673540	5679220	Is it tickles me?
5679220	5680980	I remember my first time summoning a monkey.
5684660	5686660	I was 13 the first time I summoned the monkey.
5688820	5689540	Oh, boy.
5691860	5692580	I was in the bathroom.
5692580	5693700	My mom was like, get out of there.
5694660	5695300	What are you doing?
5696020	5700100	I yell out encouragingly, uh, go marbles, go!
5701860	5702500	Marbles?
5704100	5705620	That happens, yeah, that happens.
5708660	5709860	It's Chris's turn.
5711620	5713300	Go marbles, go.
5716580	5717220	Marbles?
5718500	5721220	Is there a goal to delight these foes into submission?
5725860	5726980	Does he have a little hat on?
5729540	5731940	Yeah, put a birthday hat on him.
5733700	5735380	Just have him dance around, maybe a little.
5737380	5744580	I just love the juxtaposition of Spencer in a bad mood so serious and having to say,
5744580	5746420	you summon a monkey, he appears.
5748740	5749220	Sorry.
5749220	5750980	I'm not in a bad mood, you guys.
5752020	5752580	No, I know.
5752580	5753380	I'm sorry, Spencer.
5754020	5755060	I'm sorry.
5755060	5756020	No, don't be sorry.
5756660	5757620	It's okay.
5757620	5759620	What did the monkey do to the shadow things?
5759620	5761140	He didn't do any damage.
5761140	5762260	Well, you delighted them.
5762260	5763220	He delighted them.
5763540	5765540	Yeah, it certainly, it certainly was an entertaining problem.
5765540	5767940	They called their wives and told them that they love their wives,
5767940	5769540	their shadow wives is what happened.
5771060	5774420	I'm watching an ape named marbles, uh, try to attack me.
5774420	5776340	I just wanted to make sure you're okay, darling.
5777220	5778900	I'll be home, I'll be home after eight.
5782660	5784180	Uh, so it's Chris's turn.
5786260	5787060	That's Duncan.
5787060	5787460	Oh, sorry.
5789220	5790820	Well, um...
5790820	5792500	I eat a high cholesterol breakfast.
5794500	5795380	So, uh...
5795380	5796420	I burned my bridges.
5796420	5799780	Have we, have we hurt any of these things, any of these things at all?
5799780	5801140	Like, how, how are...
5801140	5802180	I knocked one down, right?
5802180	5802660	So one...
5802660	5803940	Yeah, you cut one down.
5803940	5804980	It's not moving.
5804980	5805620	It's not moving.
5805620	5810580	So I go to that being and try to give him CPR.
5810580	5811220	No, I'm just kidding.
5811220	5812260	I don't do that.
5812260	5816340	Do, do we have, um, maybe we should run.
5817140	5819220	Is that, does it seem like we can run you, you guys?
5819220	5820180	Why don't we just run?
5820180	5822420	Jump upon my back, all of you.
5822660	5824740	Yeah, and you on Coco and whatnot.
5824740	5829780	And I, I could throw my blinding bombs at the shadow beasts
5829780	5831620	and then we'll just get the fuck out of here.
5832820	5835140	Most of that plan is good other than the fact that, like,
5835140	5836580	only two people can fit on, uh...
5837620	5838580	I'm not running.
5838580	5839620	I've been running my whole life.
5839620	5840580	I'll, no, you...
5842340	5845540	I'll stay behind as a distraction, you guys go.
5847540	5851780	Leave him, he is too slow, for he is Kamal's character
5851780	5853540	and shall live to die another day.
5853540	5855620	Well, we have, we have shadow Coco too, right?
5855620	5856260	Oh, yeah.
5856260	5859460	So that's four people.
5860180	5860820	Yes.
5860820	5861860	Fucking, let's do it.
5861860	5862500	Not running.
5863700	5864020	Why?
5868180	5868980	I feel a monologue.
5868980	5870180	Why didn't you expect me to be asked last?
5870180	5872180	I feel, I feel a monologue coming on.
5872820	5875460	Jump upon my back, be not shy.
5875460	5877220	What if Hitler had run from...
5878740	5880580	World War II would have been six months
5880580	5882420	instead of five and a half years.
5882420	5883540	He did, he killed himself.
5884180	5886660	First example off the top of my head, wrong one to grab.
5886660	5887780	Okay, shitty example.
5887780	5891300	What if, what if everyone Hitler fought had run?
5894500	5895300	Then there would have been...
5895300	5897380	What if George Washington ran from the Delaware?
5898820	5899460	The Neheshian...
5899460	5902820	What if dirt ran from, from, from, from, from itself?
5904740	5906500	The sky would be made of dirt.
5906500	5907300	Here, he's right.
5909220	5910500	He's right, he's right.
5910580	5914820	We should stay and fight these invincible shadow beings.
5914820	5915540	He's right.
5915540	5917140	Marbles the monkey out.
5917860	5921860	After Marbles, do I have any fucking powers here that I can...
5922580	5926020	You can, you can stomp on people, you can stab people with your heart.
5926020	5927460	Watch me fucking work.
5929860	5931780	Let's go rodeo on these dicks.
5933780	5934260	All right.
5935060	5936100	So you want to stab him?
5937220	5939700	Honey, I want to do everything I can to get out of this.
5941540	5942740	Great groups, everybody.
5942740	5944660	If he ain't gonna run, then I'm gonna kick ass.
5948020	5948500	Spencer.
5949300	5949700	What's up?
5949700	5952020	Oh, I'm just resolving an attack real quick.
5952020	5952820	Hold up, you guys.
5953380	5954420	Terrific.
5954420	5955380	You deal.
5955380	5958500	No, no, you're charging towards one of the shadowy foes.
5958500	5962340	You strike him directly with your horn, dealing 16 damage.
5964340	5966660	That is precisely what I'm talking about.
5968820	5969320	What?
5970660	5971160	Mic bump.
5972820	5973620	Was there a question?
5974900	5976020	So how many foes are left now?
5976020	5977380	Let me know when it's my turn.
5977380	5978500	There's still five.
5978500	5979140	Jesus Christ.
5979140	5981380	Wait, I didn't get to throw my blinding bombs.
5981380	5981860	That's true.
5981860	5983460	I thought you changed your mind up.
5983460	5983780	I did.
5983780	5985140	I could still throw the...
5985140	5986820	You could throw all sorts of stuff, man.
5986820	5987300	Oh, okay.
5987300	5989380	Throw the blinding bombs and then let's kick ass.
5989380	5991780	So I throw to create a distraction.
5993220	6000180	I take just like one small hit from one of my vials of acid and throw three smoke bombs.
6000980	6002980	Do I...
6002980	6006660	I throw three blinding bombs at the shadow beasts.
6006660	6009780	Throwing three blinding bombs at the feet of the shadow of beasts.
6009780	6012820	Just sounds like a euphemism that a drunk uncle would use at Thanksgiving.
6014100	6016260	Let me throw one of my blinding bombs on you.
6018020	6019700	This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.
6019700	6020500	I feel hurty.
6021940	6024100	That's just the blinding bombs.
6028580	6029620	I don't know what's happening.
6030820	6032260	Spencer, if we lose you, we're fucked.
6033540	6034660	What is happening?
6034660	6035620	Blinding bombs.
6035620	6036900	Yeah, no, they work.
6036900	6038020	The people are blind now.
6039620	6042820	Jump upon my back and Kego's back and let's fucketh off.
6044100	6045060	I'm not running.
6046580	6047460	It's not running.
6047460	6048260	It's called...
6052340	6053140	Galla-bang.
6055300	6057460	Discretion is the better part of valor.
6057460	6058740	Be not thy so proud.
6058740	6060660	Love hath no pride when I call out your name.
6060660	6061460	And where will we go?
6062100	6065300	To a place where there's no more shadow people with swords for hands?
6066180	6068980	Jesus fuck, you burned my forest to the ground, you cocksucker.
6068980	6071380	Can't you fucking jump on my back and run with me for a while?
6075620	6077780	Is it possible, though, that these shadows...
6077780	6081300	If we vanquish these shadow people, that we'll get our shadows back.
6081300	6084020	Maybe they're the embodiments of our shadows in some way?
6084020	6086100	Or no, are they just guardians of...
6086100	6086980	Makes sense to me.
6087300	6088660	Lazy Katzenbergian one.
6089700	6092820	Looking at them, they don't seem like they look like your shadows,
6092820	6094500	but that still might be the case.
6094500	6096980	Can I give marbles some of my arrows?
6098900	6100340	Would you toss them to her?
6101060	6101940	Oh, it's a she.
6105380	6106900	You thought marbles was a guy?
6108020	6108820	I did.
6108820	6112180	I thought he was a plucky little fellow.
6112740	6120500	I give madam marbles five of my arrows, and I say,
6121460	6122500	you know what to do with these.
6123860	6127780	The idea being that marbles is going to take those arrows
6127780	6130420	and stab the shadows in the head.
6132100	6135940	Because marbles is very agile, and he's a monkey.
6135940	6136980	She's a monkey.
6136980	6137780	She's a monkey.
6137780	6138900	That's true.
6139460	6145220	She identifies as male gender-wise, but her sexuality, female.
6146180	6146900	What's happening?
6148500	6148980	Arrows?
6150820	6154420	Marbles is going to try to stab five shadows with five arrows.
6154420	6155700	Marbles has something to prove.
6157460	6160740	As it happens, marbles doesn't have anything to prove.
6161300	6164500	Anyway, you give her the arrows, but she doesn't seem very confused.
6164500	6169860	What is happening?
6174580	6176340	So marbles doesn't have anything to prove.
6176340	6178260	So side question, with these magical beasts,
6179700	6184100	they have no wants, or they're just fucking animals?
6185060	6185380	Ask them.
6185380	6186660	Or do they have personalities?
6186660	6187380	I don't know.
6187380	6188100	You can't like...
6188100	6190500	You just told me how marbles felt.
6190500	6192100	I said she didn't have anything to prove.
6193460	6193780	Yeah.
6194660	6195860	That's a possession.
6197620	6199220	Something to prove, right?
6200820	6203780	Well, I was thinking, I don't know, marbles' parents said,
6203780	6206100	hey, marbles, you'll never amount to anything.
6207380	6209060	You'll never murder a shadow creature.
6209060	6210500	Well, it brings up an interesting question.
6210500	6212500	When we summon these beasts, where do they come from?
6212500	6214900	They come from an alternate plane, actually, yeah.
6214900	6216100	Where they're just hanging out?
6216100	6216420	Yeah.
6216420	6218020	So they have lives of their own?
6218020	6218500	Well, yeah.
6218500	6220340	They have it, and then they get pulled through,
6220340	6223460	and then they're confused, and they attack whatever looks the most threatening.
6223460	6226180	So marbles might have had something to prove, maybe.
6226180	6228180	But you're saying that marbles doesn't.
6228180	6232260	I'm saying, you know, I'll redact that and say that there's no way of knowing.
6232260	6233300	Should I fuck marbles?
6234820	6235300	Yes.
6235300	6235860	God, no!
6237780	6240100	Let's make sure that marbles has something to prove.
6240100	6242180	I'm only asking, unless I'm going to.
6242180	6244660	I'm saying, should I or should I not fuck marbles?
6244660	6246820	I can't say what you should or shouldn't do.
6246820	6248340	Can I say something?
6248340	6248740	Yes.
6248740	6252100	If you're gonna fuck the monkey, will you fuck me first?
6253940	6254420	Yes!
6255940	6256420	All right.
6260420	6262660	I will cover my emotional ties with marbles.
6262660	6263300	You know what?
6263300	6266100	Actually, fuck me after you fuck the monkey.
6269540	6273620	Why waste a chance to get extra dimensional aids?
6273620	6273940	Well, yeah.
6279540	6281860	Right now, Christopher, I like where you're going with this,
6281860	6284900	but right now, we dazzled these shadow figures.
6284900	6286020	They're blinded right now.
6287140	6289380	That's the time to fuck, my man.
6291700	6294180	Look, I'm hard as a fucking diamond right now.
6294180	6294820	Me too.
6296740	6301140	I would like to cast charm person on one of the shadow creatures when it's my turn,
6301140	6302820	because it's a level one spell.
6302820	6303700	Charm person.
6304980	6306020	It has no effect.
6306820	6313140	I go into a barbarian rage, I go into a berserk rage.
6313140	6320420	I jump astride marbles, and I take out my far sword, and I go on marbles,
6320420	6323860	and we run towards him, and taking out my far sword,
6323860	6328180	I hold it out like a clothesline and try to slice through all of them like I'm cutting
6328180	6329700	down them all like a bunch of trees.
6329700	6332020	How big do you think marbles is?
6336020	6338660	I was five fives.
6341060	6342100	Make Ryan size.
6343620	6344980	I guess I could have done a better job.
6344980	6348020	I was always thinking of marbles as like a marmoset size.
6348020	6349540	Like, so even for a melee.
6349540	6349940	Okay, okay, okay.
6349940	6351220	First off, forget marbles.
6351220	6352420	I jump astride Tylenol.
6352420	6354660	I go, Tylenol, it's you and me, baby.
6354660	6355860	Let's roll.
6355860	6359860	I jump astride Tylenol's back in a berserker rage,
6359860	6365940	and I grab a fistful of mane, and I pull marbles toward me, and I go,
6366260	6367220	we're going to go in there.
6372420	6374820	Two separate people, but we're coming out.
6376260	6379780	One fucked monkey.
6382420	6386740	And I give him a little spur, a little boot into his haunches, and I go,
6386740	6393620	oh, and I unwield, unsheathe my far sword, and try to slice down the shadow of figures.
6393620	6395460	Okay, so all of this is happening,
6395460	6398980	but you're still being, like, strangulated by that shadow.
6398980	6400180	Oh, fuck, I forgot about that.
6400180	6403540	That's still, you know, you're choking, but this stuff can still be happening.
6403540	6406020	Okay, so with your far sword strike,
6406020	6409940	you attempt to attack as many of the shadow creatures as you possibly can.
6409940	6412260	At a full gallop, astride Tylenol with codeine.
6412260	6414740	At a full gallop, astride Tylenol with codeine.
6414740	6418580	You unleash a far sword blast directly towards the shadow creatures,
6421300	6423060	hitting merely two of them.
6423060	6423940	Oh, cock.
6423940	6425300	That's still good, that's still good.
6425300	6426500	I don't know why I framed it that way.
6426500	6427700	Yeah, two is good.
6427700	6428980	Two is great, you guys.
6428980	6432980	Dealing 11 damage and 17 damage.
6435220	6439140	One of the shadows falls slain, the other is still standing.
6439140	6440820	You're faced with four.
6440820	6443060	You might want to cover time there.
6445060	6445540	Three.
6446420	6447060	Might want to what?
6447060	6450180	Oh, he's saying we're never going to finish this fight.
6450980	6451860	Let's get out of here.
6452980	6454420	I say we end on a bang.
6454660	6457860	We take, let's pick one of them and not talk about it.
6457860	6459220	Well done, Barbarian.
6459220	6462580	Look at those that you have slain and the others that are still standing.
6463940	6466020	Wait, does this mean the game's about to end?
6466020	6466740	I hope so.
6466740	6467940	Chris, do you have a sword I can have?
6469780	6470900	Do I have hair?
6470900	6472580	Yeah, you have hair.
6472580	6478180	Okay, before the game ends with my dagger, I cut all my hair off.
6478980	6484260	All of it is, all of it's got to take swipe trunks with my dagger.
6484260	6484740	Do you want it?
6484740	6488580	And then I give you my, take my hair cutting dagger.
6488580	6490180	Oh, well, thank you.
6490180	6491380	I was just kidding, but.
6491380	6493380	I freeze time and do a crazy rap.
6494900	6508100	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6508660	6511460	Super fly, honey, to the money, motherfucker.
6512260	6515060	Put your mama down and I started to pucker.
6515060	6517380	Put her in the field and in the sky.
6517380	6518980	Fuck your mama so low.
6518980	6520500	Fuck your mama high.
6520500	6521300	I'm sorry.
6521300	6523700	In the background of this rap, keep going, keep rapping.
6523700	6528980	In the background, I take Christopher's hand and pull them off into the shadows.
6528980	6530500	Yes, take me.
6531220	6541940	Yeah, I rap over them as they conjugate like Richard Gere and Guinevere in First Night.
6541940	6545540	And I pull him out of the shadows so everyone can watch.
6547220	6551380	Except instead of Sean Connery, instead of stabbing a sword into the dirt,
6551380	6554100	am I getting my Arthurian movies mixed?
6555060	6559860	I just watch them fuck and I rap over them, which is what King Arthur didn't do.
6560660	6563700	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6563700	6566820	I like the shape of your ass thrusting in and out.
6566820	6570260	I like the way your dimples like to pout.
6570260	6573540	Like to look at your manly calves.
6573540	6579700	Like to look at both male halves coming together to form androgyny.
6579700	6583140	I like to witness sexual heterogeneity.
6583140	6586100	I like to see a wiener go into a butt.
6586100	6592180	I like to look at it, but I like to also participate.
6592180	6595780	So I'm going to drop my pants and masturbate.
6595780	6598820	I'm going to spread my seat onto the dirt.
6598820	6602020	And where I come from, that's called starting to flirt.
6602020	6603940	Thank you for coming to Harman Town, everybody.
6607540	6608180	We did it.
6608180	6609940	That was a rapping closer.
6610500	6613940	Thanks for, that was a bit of an epic.
6614420	6616820	How about a round of applause for Greg Primps, everyone.
6620340	6621300	Duncan Trussell.
6623700	6624660	Aaron McGathey.
6626900	6628020	Spencer Crittenden.
6630340	6634980	And of course, everybody here at Meltdown Comics are making this the best place to do a podcast
6634980	6635700	in the world.
6635700	6637300	I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis.
6637300	6638100	Thank you very much.
6640420	6642340	One more time for your mayor, Dan Harman.
6643940	6652340	We will try and watch the abominable Dr. Fives this week and get back to you, Marcy.
6654340	6659140	And we're still Monday nights until further notice, until we move to Sunday.
6659140	6661060	Someone put their character sheet in the ice bucket?
6662420	6663060	What the fuck?
6663060	6663940	Thank you for coming, everybody.
6663940	6664980	We love you all dearly.
