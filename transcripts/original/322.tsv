0	7000	Ladies and gentlemen, how are you tonight?
7000	12000	I know you can make so much more noise than that.
12000	13000	How are you tonight?
13000	14000	Yeah!
14000	17000	Harbin Town is now in session.
17000	19000	Just in at the time of the night,
19000	21000	I'm sitting in for a minute and waiting for a second.
21000	23000	Let's get what the fuck to it and bring out
23000	25000	the mayor of Harbin Town,
25000	29000	Mr. Dan Harbin!
29000	33000	It's been the same since we've been here.
33000	36000	You're the person who's gone.
36000	38000	I'll win.
38000	40000	I keep on losing.
40000	44000	Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Waw for first.

48000	49000	I'll win.
49000	51000	I'll try, ladies and gentlemen.

54000	55000	I'll win.
55000	56000	I'll win.
56000	57000	I'll win.
57000	60000	Thanks, everybody, for coming on a Monday night.
60000	63000	Boy, we've got a lot of show for you.
63000	64000	Oh, my gosh.
64000	66000	Spencer, we've got Jeff, but we've got...
66000	67000	I mean, come on.
67000	68000	We've got the dream team.
68000	71000	Four empty seats.
71000	74000	Yeah, we've got a provocative guest.
74000	75000	We've got...
75000	76000	Topics.
76000	79000	We've got topics.
79000	81000	I'm just going off of what Shrob's been telling me
81000	83000	over drinks before the show.
83000	84000	I'm filling them in, people.
84000	86000	Here's the bullet points.
86000	89000	There's a megastorm coming to California
89000	91000	that's going to kill us all.
91000	93000	Bigger than a big earthquake.
93000	97000	I thought we just went through that shit.
97000	101000	There's a man named Ingersoll Lockwood,
101000	107000	who in 1896 wrote a book about how the Trump family
107000	109000	is time-traveling through...
109000	110000	All true.
110000	113000	Through Tesla energies that exploded
113000	114000	in the center of the earth.
114000	117000	1900, or the last president?
117000	118000	The magical journeys...
118000	120000	There's a YouTube video, and yeah.
120000	121000	I mean, we've got to talk about that,
121000	123000	but we'll wait for our guests to come out.
123000	124000	We'll save it.
124000	127000	We're just giving you a table of contents right now.
127000	129000	What else is going on?
129000	134000	Look, I asked Spencer for permission.
134000	137000	I've been in a terrible mood lately.
137000	138000	I've been very depressed.
138000	141000	I say that assuming that that resonates
142000	143000	with a lot of people.
143000	145000	I don't know if it's the weather
145000	148000	or if it's like the apocalypse,
148000	151000	but in my case, I mean, it might even be...
151000	155000	It's just like my therapist has been warning me.
155000	157000	You're arriving at happiness.
157000	160000	It's not going to feel like what you're used to calling happiness.
160000	163000	It's going to feel like the misplacement of something valuable,
163000	166000	which is your fucking sadness you're addicted to.
166000	170000	Don't succumb to the urge to find it.
170000	171000	Let it be missing.
171000	173000	It's your sadness.
173000	177000	What you're experiencing is going to be this like banal limbo
177000	181000	that's going to be like starting this happiness diet.
181000	184000	Like you know, you're miserable.
184000	189000	I cried through my smile.
193000	194000	Do you get depressed?
194000	196000	You're always in such a great mood.
196000	198000	As a black man in America, no!
199000	200000	Why would you?
201000	204000	Oh, just think about cotton.
205000	207000	Happy February, by the way.
207000	209000	Thank you so much.
209000	210000	Thank you so much.
210000	212000	Congratulations. What a month.
212000	216000	You know, we're so happy with all the new developments.
216000	219000	We like to say we're creating black history right now.
219000	220000	Yeah.
220000	222000	I'm sure you don't watch my Instagram workout,
222000	226000	but I'm like fucking like really bringing the black history thunder.
226000	228000	Yeah, you're like Sojourner Truth.
228000	230000	I mean, I know you're mocking me.
230000	232000	This motherfucker don't know what Eddie is.
233000	234000	Is that black?
234000	235000	Damn it.
235000	236000	Is it historical?
236000	237000	Yes.
237000	239000	Oh, then I'll learn about it then tomorrow.
239000	242000	You can't keep anything from me.
242000	246000	Yeah, I'm like, we're like a little past halfway through,
246000	248000	and I work out every other day.
248000	253000	So I'm like, I know like five of the amendments now.
253000	256000	I know that our entire hit.
256000	259000	I know that, you know, this is going to sound corny and like white nighty
259000	261000	or whatever you call it, virtue signaling.
261000	264000	But like the profound thing I'm learning as a middle aged man,
264000	266000	like taking black history seriously,
266000	268000	but I'm reading an hour a morning going like,
268000	270000	okay, what the fuck is Plessy versus Ferguson?
270000	271000	Here we go.
271000	272000	Okay.
272000	275000	And I don't mean to make that front sound like the truth.
276000	279000	I mean, I mean Plessy versus Ferguson deserves that front sound,
279000	282000	but black history, of course, does not.
283000	287000	If anything, it deserves a choir of angels.
287000	291000	The black history is US history and vice versa.
291000	294000	I mean, the country is like, it's so, I mean,
294000	297000	I know that we know that intellectually, but I'm just sort of like,
297000	299000	God damn, this is, everything comes out of this.
299000	303000	It's like this weird experiment that we've done where we were the,
303000	305000	we were kind of the, we were the worst.
305000	308000	I grew up being taught that we were like,
308000	312000	that the US was just like playing ball with this global thing called slavery
312000	315000	and that the US was like, okay, I guess we'll do it too.
315000	320000	We were, we were, no, we were like really into it.
320000	322000	And I honestly did not know that.
322000	327000	And I thought, and that like, and that then this young country,
327000	330000	like spent most of its life engaged in that concept.
330000	334000	Like this, like this God of capitalism that we worship,
334000	336000	where we're like, there's no kings here.
336000	338000	You can't be born special.
338000	341000	You could, as long as you work hard,
341000	343000	you could take over the country.
343000	345000	Anyways, get back to work for free.
345000	346000	Uh, here you hear you.
346000	349000	Those guys should be able to vote and not be owned.
349000	352000	You're like, yeah, I agree.
352000	355000	Oh, what are we going to do?
355000	356000	True.
356000	361000	It's amazing how much shit we got done despite all the people trying to stop us.
361000	362000	I know.
362000	364000	Like we really were like, sort of like, damn,
364000	366000	we got to build this shit anyway.
366000	368000	I keep putting my other hand.
368000	369000	I put two different hats.
369000	372000	I put on my 1800s racist hat.
372000	373000	It's not that hard for me.
373000	375000	I'm like, I should be really heavy.
375000	383000	I'm like, it's made of wood and like Danish bones straw.
383000	384000	You're not very good at it.
384000	385000	It's the 1800s.
385000	387000	You're not very good at hat making, but you've got a hat.
387000	388000	And I keep up.
388000	391000	I'm like, well, these people in the past,
391000	396000	they didn't know the future that they could either service or undercut every
397000	398000	step of the way.
398000	402000	I I'm, I'm a little comfortable supposing that there's probably,
402000	404000	there's like these, we, we got,
404000	407000	we got genuine eugenics style racists in the world.
407000	410000	Like people who are genuinely like for real,
410000	413000	let me measure your skull, like fucking like count, like,
413000	414000	like, like, like, like no really,
414000	418000	like they're into like the whole like biological aspect of it.
418000	421000	Those people are, are like, like,
421000	424000	we, what we have much in a much larger group is like a lot of like
424000	428000	conservative people, maybe who are like, don't tell me I owe anybody
428000	429000	anything.
429000	430000	And I just got here.
430000	432000	I don't have to feel guilty about anything.
432000	433000	I don't want to share my money.
433000	434000	I don't know about, you know, and that kind of shit.
434000	438000	Not so much like, I think a vast majority of us would agree actually
438000	442000	that given what we're dealing with today,
442000	446000	we can all look back with hindsight a hundred short years ago and go,
446000	447000	oops,
447000	450000	that was dumb because what that did is it fucked up for everything for
450000	452000	everybody right now.
452000	453000	You know what I mean?
453000	456000	Do you agree or disagree with that dumb white explanation?
456000	460000	Um, it's interesting.
460000	461000	Okay.
461000	462000	All right.
462000	464000	That's so that's as much as I'm going to get at.
464000	465000	Yeah.
465000	467000	There's a lot there.
467000	470000	I'm just saying like, like the great migration like lately,
470000	471000	like where it's like, okay,
471000	474000	the civil war is over and the emancipation has happened.
474000	475000	And it's like,
475000	477000	people are just like doing what you'd expect them to do,
477000	479000	which is just like start to fill the rest of the,
479000	480000	just get the fuck out of here.
480000	482000	Half of them can't get out of here.
482000	483000	Right.
483000	484000	And then half of them are like, where do I go?
484000	485000	What do I do?
485000	486000	What do I dress like?
486000	487000	What should my name be?
487000	489000	What is my fucking role in this country?
489000	493000	They hid in the woods for decades.
493000	494000	They hid in the woods.
494000	497000	They hid in the woods and then they started to form towns.
497000	503000	So it got as far as Oklahoma and then some people got here and there.
503000	504000	The smartest thing you could do is go north,
504000	507000	which is why you have cities like Detroit.
507000	509000	Um, but they didn't get that far out west,
509000	512000	but for the most part they would have to clump together in groups
512000	513000	and hide in the woods.
513000	519000	So the like first three, four years after slavery ends,
519000	522000	people are just out in the woods, which is crazy.
522000	527000	It's like, it's very, uh, seems like cartoonishly simple.
527000	528000	It's tragic.
528000	532000	There are cartoons that are tragic, but, um,
532000	534000	they're just living in the woods.
534000	536000	It literally, here's the thing.
536000	540000	And this piece of history is they didn't know what to do.
540000	541000	Right.
541000	542000	Like they just let people go.
542000	544000	This is what I'm, that's what I'm saying.
544000	548000	Back at that period and we go like, so as a running,
548000	553000	like the white kind of like, uh, like panic simulator in my head,
553000	557000	when I go back in time and I don't have the privilege of being like,
557000	559000	oh, I'm like living in the future and I'm like, oh, well,
559000	561000	of course everybody should blah, blah, blah.
561000	565000	Like who knows what I would have called self care, uh, back then,
565000	567000	as far as I'm not getting into trouble.
567000	568000	You know what it is?
568000	570000	Grease and a little bit of methylate them.
570000	574000	The, uh, but like no, everybody was like having arguments about like,
574000	576000	well, you're free.
576000	580000	You should go away now or, uh, you're free.
580000	583000	Everyone should give you a bunch of money now or you're free.
583000	584000	I hate you.
584000	586000	I got to figure out how to make you hate yourself.
586000	591000	Like nobody was thinking about everybody was like wondering what was
591000	593000	going to happen tomorrow.
593000	597000	And 80% of it was like trying to avoid something that they didn't even
597000	599000	know what they were trying to avoid.
599000	600000	They just were scared.
600000	603000	No, all those three thoughts that you just had were actual thoughts that
603000	604000	those people had.
604000	608000	So self hate making a black people hate themselves for sure.
608000	610000	Go, go away.
610000	613000	It was certainly part of plan.
613000	618000	Um, I mean, there were abolitionists who, who, who were like, yeah,
618000	620000	I'm, I hate slavery.
620000	622000	We got to get these people out of here.
622000	624000	That, that was what blew my mind.
624000	629000	It was like, like, like the people that were there, it wasn't like people
629000	634000	were like looking at this room today and going like, so what can we do to
634000	635000	make their life?
635000	639000	Like, uh, how can we, how can we, how can we lead to that in a right way so
639000	643000	that everyone there doesn't have a bunch of like disproportionate
643000	647000	disenfranchisement and everything's like kinda like confusing and in
647000	651000	turmoil with a lot of weird debates and uh, uh, scary, awkward podcast
651000	652000	conversations.
652000	654000	No, no, it's not scary.
654000	656000	They weren't thinking about us.
656000	659000	They were thinking about, they were definitely thinking about
659000	662000	maintaining power for at least a thousand years.
662000	663000	There is a thousand year plan.
663000	664000	That's what those things are.
664000	668000	Like the Marshall plan and all these manifest destinies is like when a
668000	670000	bunch of guys get together and say, what are we going to do for the next
670000	672000	four or 500 years?
672000	675000	People are thinking like dynasty for real.
675000	679000	It's, it's crazy because we don't think like that, but there are legit
679000	682000	dudes that are like, yeah.
682000	683000	I don't even know what I think.
683000	684000	Like I want to know what the equipment is.
684000	687000	Like when I think about the future, I picture a bunch of people on a space
687000	691000	station, like harvesting soy out of a hydroponic garden and every,
691000	693000	everyone looks vaguely like tiger woods.
693000	696000	Probably like, like, like, because, because we're never going to stop
696000	698000	being racist.
698000	700000	You're never going to eliminate racism.
700000	701000	You're going to eliminate race.
701000	703000	That's the first thing that's going to happen.
703000	705000	You always say that you always say you're never going to eliminate
705000	709000	racism, but remember that the thing that racism is attacking is stronger
709000	711000	than racism.
711000	713000	So I don't know how that's possible.
713000	716000	It's almost like you really cannot beat women.
716000	721000	You think you can, but the, the, the initial like attempt at starting that
721000	724000	war has you fucked already.
724000	726000	Like that's just a bad idea to begin with.
726000	727000	Yeah.
727000	731000	And if you look at where we're at right now, um, they didn't re we didn't
731000	735000	really respond the way we were supposed to respond necessarily voting wise.
735000	739000	And we have more women in Congress, so women still figured out a way to get
739000	740000	past us.
740000	741000	Yeah.
741000	742000	You know what I'm saying?
742000	743000	No, that's the same thing goes for.
743000	747000	The same thing goes for race is that you, you will wear yourself out trying to
747000	748000	oppress.
748000	749000	Yeah.
749000	751000	That's a big theme of black history that I'm getting into is like noticing
751000	755000	that basically like you have lots of people that I like narcissistically,
755000	759000	I go like, oh, this person is more of a Dan Harmon because they just want to
759000	760000	be left alone.
760000	765000	They are actually born kind of privileged relative to other people that, that
765000	766000	may have that complexion.
766000	769000	And actually the war came to them because they couldn't, there was these
769000	773000	policies like, uh, the, the, this morning's lesson was about Mamie, Mamie
773000	778000	Phipps, Clark, you know, the, the, the, the, who did the, the doll test that
778000	781000	was like a part of the Brown versus education.
781000	786000	The doll test is taking the dolls and you, you got, you got dolls that have
786000	790000	blonde hair and white faces and dolls that are Brown skin and black hair.
790000	791000	Fight.
791000	794000	And you say to kids that are like welcome soccer robots, gather a bunch of
794000	798000	kids that are two to five years old from segregated schools and from
798000	800000	desegregated schools.
800000	804000	And you sit them down and white kids and black kids and girls and boys and you
804000	805000	all these control groups and whatever.
805000	811000	And you say to the kids, which one is, uh, which one's the bad kid, which
811000	814000	one's the kid you wish you were, which, et cetera, et cetera, these kind of
814000	815000	questions.
815000	821000	And like realizing that racial identity is bored into you by the age of four.
821000	823000	And then it's just fucking soldered in place.
823000	828000	Like, which isn't necessarily a bad thing except when you, when race is
828000	833000	connected to class and, and, and worth and stuff like it's okay for a kid to
833000	836000	know, I guess that there's such a thing as raised by the age of four.
836000	838000	It's really not that mature a concept.
838000	839000	It's kind of dopey.
839000	842000	You could, you could teach your kid to celebrate it too.
842000	843000	Right.
843000	845000	This is the deal with black history month.
845000	847000	We don't focus on the trauma necessarily.
847000	848000	We focus on all the fun shit.
848000	854000	Like stop lights, you know, great shit.
854000	856000	Like peanut butter, peanut butter.
856000	858000	No, there was, that's a big misconception.
858000	859000	Okay.
859000	862000	Tell me what, what, what is George watching coverage?
862000	866000	He just wanted to be left alone of all the things he did not know.
866000	867000	He did.
867000	871000	He did 1100 things with peanuts, but the peanut butter, peanut butter,
871000	874000	peanut butter, peanut butter, peanut butter, peanut butter, peanut butter,
874000	878000	peanut butter, peanut butter, peanut butter, peanut butter.
878000	880000	You know, that fucking passive aggression.
880000	882000	Who, who did?
882000	884000	It was according to Eddie Murphy.
884000	886000	It was a guy named Thomas Jeff.
886000	887000	Right.
887000	888000	Right.
888000	893000	That's the spin is you maybe look at black history month as a time to
893000	895000	celebrate all of your great bike heroes.
895000	897000	No, I want the trauma that they went through.
897000	898000	I know.
898000	899000	Believe me.
899000	904000	I don't, I don't want this to be a history of racism, but then I was like,
904000	907000	it is, and I'm that's better for me.
907000	910000	Like I am following the trauma actually.
910000	913000	And point of fact, like I'm, I'm going to be obscure.
913000	917000	I'm not going to look, I'm not going to forget Rosa parks because it's like,
917000	920000	that's curated and all this stuff, but it's like, I don't know shit about,
920000	922000	you know, the details of Rosa parks and stuff.
922000	927000	So I'm actually just going in order from Nat Turner revolt to by the end of
927000	928000	the month, I think I'm going to be,
928000	932000	I'm going to fucking bring this thing into the station with like, you know,
932000	936000	I don't know who Bobby seal or, uh, uh,
936000	939000	there's also Gerald Lowen though.
939000	941000	W it's double L E W Y N.
941000	943000	I'm not sure if I'm saying his name right, but he's like,
943000	945000	he ran time for the longest time.
945000	947000	He's like huge black time.
947000	950000	It's not the magazine, the whole corporation.
953000	955000	I was like, somebody tell him like,
957000	959000	black man ran time.
959000	962000	White man stole it from him.
962000	966000	Don't let them pacify you with shit like that, man.
966000	970000	Time isn't run by a black man.
971000	974000	Is that that guy in the hood sucker proxy?
974000	976000	Is there a old black janitor in the hood sucker proxy?
976000	978000	He was basically God.
978000	982000	He kind of likes is like the janitor in the clock, the clock building.
982000	984000	Oh, it's a hood sucker proxy.
984000	986000	So do you have any, do you have any heroes?
986000	987000	Was there anybody that you learned about that?
987000	988000	You were like, and then we got to go,
988000	991000	but do you have anybody that you like were like, I didn't know this dude.
991000	992000	This is incredible.
992000	995000	Like GPS is a black woman.
995000	998000	Well, style wise, I like Langston Hughes,
998000	1001000	but he's got to be a person who I learned the least amount about
1001000	1004000	because he's a poet and I didn't like read any of his poetry.
1004000	1007000	But, uh, um, I like that.
1007000	1011000	I like that there's debate about his sexuality and like that.
1011000	1014000	It's like, it's none of your business, you know?
1014000	1018000	And then he like, he dressed fancy and he was just like, he was positive.
1018000	1022000	He's, his quotes were like, like, hey,
1022000	1025000	if the white man is happy with the colored man,
1025000	1032000	sorry for my own fashionable language, uh, the, uh, uh, that's great.
1032000	1034000	Uh, if he's not, can't do nothing about that.
1034000	1038000	Like don't, you know, if the black man is happy with the black man,
1038000	1040000	terrific bonus gravy.
1040000	1043000	If he's not, Hey, well, you know, it's like this kind of like that.
1043000	1048000	It was, I like, I like that guy because it was like, he, he, like,
1048000	1054000	that's what I, I needed my life right now is like overcoming approval addiction.
1054000	1058000	And like the Harlem Renaissance was like, like about like,
1058000	1062000	I think I'm in my own Harlem Renaissance right now. Brandon is what I'm saying.
1062000	1067000	Okay. Okay. I will fuck with this.
1067000	1071000	I've got, I've been emancipated from a certain tax bracket and I've like done
1071000	1077000	a great migration up to the urban centers of, so all you need now is a gold
1077000	1083000	chain. Yeah, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to invent new ways to walk.
1083000	1087000	I'm going to write poems about nothing but rivers.
1087000	1091000	I'm going to give a shit if anyone gets it and people can just speculate about
1091000	1098000	where I put my dick.
1098000	1100000	I like that people are like, Oh, he's clearly gay,
1100000	1102000	which is pretty important. It's important to the gay people.
1102000	1105000	If he was gay and he was in the closet, then it's important that he was in the
1105000	1109000	closet. Why was he in the closet, et cetera? That's important to current things.
1109000	1112000	So, you know, you don't detract from that, but it's,
1112000	1115000	it's also just kind of funny. You go like, like, you, you, well,
1115000	1118000	you say because he really, really, really respected black men.
1118000	1120000	So he was, there's like, come on, look at this.
1120000	1124000	Look at, look at this thing he wrote about, about the, the, the, the, the,
1124000	1128000	the regalness of the black man or whatever. Like, like, wow,
1128000	1134000	that's some gay stuff. Like kind of like that's, that's fucked up though.
1134000	1137000	You know, you can't, you like, you're right there. It's like interesting.
1137000	1140000	He's like, like, uh, yeah. So, so yeah, I think, uh,
1140000	1144000	I guess that's my hero right now. All right. Langston Hughes,
1144000	1149000	but I really should read something he wrote. You'd love it. You'd love it.
1149000	1152000	Yeah. And, uh, dust off a little James Baldwin as well.
1152000	1157000	Cause you would love James Baldwin, James Baldwin, two L's, one L,
1157000	1162000	one D, Baldwin. You would love James Baldwin.
1162000	1167000	All right. Well, let's, I mean, like as, as if by magic, Rob,
1167000	1173000	what do you have to say about black history?
1173000	1178000	Uh, I like candy man.
1178000	1183000	Now there's a great, uh, documentary call on shutter called horror noir
1183000	1188000	that goes through like the history of a black cinema in the horror genre.
1188000	1192000	That's actually really, really good. Keith David's in it. He's fantastic.
1192000	1198000	Tony Todd. Candy man is in it. What is the, what is the, the, what's the,
1198000	1204000	the, what do we glean about the connection between blackness and horror?
1204000	1209000	Like, what's the special relationship? Well, well,
1213000	1218000	when they start off with like the, the, like the black, the horrible shit.
1218000	1221000	Well, well, they start off with like birth of a nation is like,
1221000	1224000	is like a horror film for black people. It's just like,
1224000	1228000	this is terrifying because it was incredibly popular and it just,
1228000	1231000	it was shown for that.
1231000	1235000	It's kind of started all these horrible stereotypes that we still see to this
1235000	1237000	day. Well, the idea of being,
1237000	1240000	what is the deal with the idea of being scared of ghosts and stuff?
1240000	1243000	Like what's that? Who isn't afraid of ghosts?
1243000	1248000	I guess, I guess white people think it's hilarious that black people are also
1248000	1250000	afraid of ghosts.
1250000	1252000	Do you think it's like Doth protest too much?
1252000	1256000	Like we're scared of black power and so we're like,
1256000	1259000	make them scared, make them more scared of ghosts.
1259000	1263000	I do think there's this thing about scaring the thing that scares you.
1263000	1266000	Well, that they touch on that in this documentary is like they go through like,
1266000	1269000	well, first it was like birth of a nation where it was vilified.
1269000	1274000	And then, then the black, uh, the black actor in like, I don't know,
1274000	1277000	like Bella Lugosi meets a Brooklyn gorilla or whatever.
1277000	1279000	And then like, there's the, who is it?
1279000	1282000	The terrible stereotype of that.
1282000	1285000	He's a fool and idiot to somebody that you laugh at.
1285000	1287000	And then as we go through into the eighties,
1287000	1290000	when we get to like from beyond and Ken Forey going,
1290000	1292000	I used to play pro football.
1292000	1295000	We were all crazy back then, you know, like he set up to be like this
1295000	1299000	unstoppable ex linebacker cop that when the bat,
1299000	1303000	when the monster takes that guy down, now we know it's for real.
1303000	1304000	And there's, they go through that.
1304000	1308000	Like that, that it's always to serve the,
1308000	1311000	the white protagonist to be the magic.
1311000	1312000	Hold on a second.
1312000	1313000	Doc.
1313000	1314000	Yeah.
1314000	1318000	Are you telling me these wombats from outer space or some kind of vampire?
1318000	1319000	Yeah.
1319000	1320000	Yeah.
1320000	1321000	Real good.
1321000	1324000	But they even, they even skirted, skirted a problematic line there,
1324000	1325000	but I think I nailed it.
1325000	1328000	But there was like, when there was like a big shift.
1328000	1330000	I think we're all afraid of vampire wombat.
1330000	1334000	But that role of the black, the black, uh, the black,
1334000	1338000	the black, the black man stepping out from the corner during the
1338000	1341000	explainer scene in a horror movie of like what we're up against.
1341000	1345000	Like the scientist is like, so basically an atomic,
1345000	1349000	uh, chain reaction will happen. So now hold on doc in English,
1349000	1353000	are you saying the more of these boogins attack us,
1353000	1355000	the stronger they get?
1355000	1357000	That's exactly it, Tyler.
1357000	1359000	And then Tyler just recedes into shadow.
1359000	1361000	His job finished.
1361000	1363000	Uh, uh, boogins.
1363000	1364000	Okay. Sorry about that.
1364000	1366000	We got a fucking, we got to script that.
1366000	1368000	There's a horror movie called the book.
1368000	1369000	It's called the book.
1369000	1372000	If not, we should, we got to make that.
1372000	1374000	Um, and that's what you would get.
1374000	1377000	If you would be underground too long, you get the book.
1377000	1380000	Ain't no, ain't no tissue underground.
1380000	1382000	But you know,
1382000	1384000	we skipped over a course night of the living dead,
1384000	1386000	which is like the more like so far.
1386000	1389000	It's like not only ahead of its time, but then not repeated where it's
1389000	1392000	like this low budget horror movie, just like,
1392000	1393000	I don't know,
1393000	1394000	I don't know.
1394000	1395000	I don't know.
1395000	1396000	I don't know.
1397000	1400000	This low budget horror movie just like stakes its claim and goes like,
1400000	1402000	they talk about night of the living dead a lot.
1402000	1403000	And it's like this.
1403000	1404000	They said, well, that movie came out.
1404000	1407000	That must've been a racist nightmare because you have Dwayne,
1407000	1410000	Dwayne Jones is like slapping the shit out of white people,
1410000	1412000	killing white zombies.
1412000	1414000	Just like, he's just telling like,
1414000	1417000	it was just, it was, it's our highly recommended.
1417000	1418000	It's really, really good.
1418000	1419000	But it's such resonant horror.
1419000	1420000	That's the thing.
1420000	1423000	That's why we continue to do that with the zombie, uh, uh, medium,
1423000	1428000	not necessarily being kind of a honestly aggressive about racial
1428000	1429000	politics.
1429000	1431000	For instance, we don't necessarily carry that tradition,
1431000	1434000	but what we've identified as the attraction of the zombie,
1434000	1439000	uh, uh, medium is that it traps the living under a microscope.
1439000	1444000	And it makes them have to deal with shit that we are already dealing
1444000	1446000	with, but are refusing to confront.
1446000	1449000	And uh, but you know, it anyways, all right,
1449000	1451000	let's uh, we've made our guest way too long.
1451000	1455000	He's a professor of African-American women's poetry at a Howard university.
1455000	1456000	No, he's not.
1462000	1465000	He's just a gangly white kid with a show on adult swim.
1465000	1467000	Please welcome Brian Weissel-Mirski.
1471000	1474000	Happy February, Weissel.
1478000	1480000	This couch looks so comfortable.
1480000	1483000	I love it that this, that you're using like the comfortable
1483000	1488000	furniture as decoration and a guest comes out and sits on this.
1489000	1490000	That is a nice couch.
1490000	1491000	Yeah.
1491000	1493000	You're looking real sharp, man.
1493000	1494000	Looking real good.
1494000	1496000	I'm not Justin Roiland.
1496000	1497000	No.
1497000	1500000	Well, did anyone promote that Justin was going to be on the show?
1500000	1502000	Oh, that was their mistake.
1502000	1504000	I saw that coming.
1504000	1508000	Justin, Justin texted me at like fucking, uh, three 30.
1508000	1511000	Like I, I ate an edible at one.
1512000	1513000	What's happening?
1513000	1516000	I thought it would be, I thought it would be over by now.
1516000	1517000	What's going on?
1518000	1520000	My hands are getting so big.
1520000	1523000	I can't understand what, what am I?
1523000	1524000	Who are you?
1524000	1525000	What's going on?
1525000	1529000	I called postmates and they came and I just let them drive away.
1529000	1531000	That's how high I am.
1532000	1537000	Like he's like, like, like, this is a sympathetic, the old baby.
1538000	1539000	Are you okay?
1539000	1540000	I'm in somebody's house.
1540000	1542000	I don't know how I got here.
1544000	1546000	I, I was, I was just sitting in the green room.
1546000	1551000	I was like, like, you know, like, uh, like, like you ever, like you have,
1551000	1555000	you have friends and like you predict their bad behavior and then if you
1555000	1559000	predict it, you could get like super pissed at them.
1559000	1563000	And it just struck me today while texting with Justin who I knew two weeks
1563000	1565000	ago was not going to show up tonight.
1566000	1570000	And I only didn't know the excuse would be eating an edible.
1571000	1577000	I didn't text him today because I feared that, but, uh, I'm, I'm,
1577000	1578000	I'm happy to be here.
1578000	1579000	I'm excited.
1579000	1580000	I mean, you're a swell guy.
1583000	1584000	Right.
1585000	1587000	Imagine being him right now.
1587000	1591000	So, you know, but that's, we were getting them on your side a little bit.
1591000	1595000	I, I pounded a drink backstage when I found out just, well, you should quit
1595000	1597000	the show then you should just bail entirely.
1598000	1599000	You took that chemical.
1599000	1600000	Get out of here.
1602000	1604000	That's the responsible thing to do.
1606000	1610000	Now, why till is like a genius that started agenda one on one and did like
1610000	1615000	the most amazing, uh, cartoons, just some of the funniest, most messed up
1615000	1616000	stuff.
1616000	1617000	I always loved it.
1617000	1619000	And, uh, is that my popcorn?
1619000	1620000	No.
1620000	1621000	Okay.
1621000	1624000	Uh, Steve Levy, ladies and gentlemen, Steve Levy.
1625000	1628000	And now you're on your second season of hot streets.
1629000	1630000	Fuck.
1630000	1631000	I'm so sorry.
1631000	1633000	Fuck having a goddamn panic attack.
1634000	1635000	I can't breathe.
1635000	1637000	Nobody's ever died from weed.
1637000	1638000	Don't worry.
1638000	1639000	I'm so itchy.
1639000	1641000	Why Saul is going to be so bummed too.
1641000	1642000	This is a mess.
1642000	1646000	I never usually do weed anymore, but I thought just felt so uncreative and
1646000	1648000	usually it helps me with that.
1648000	1650000	But I guess not this stuff.
1650000	1651000	What can I do to help?
1659000	1660000	You don't have to do anything.
1660000	1663000	That's why you texted to get permission to bail.
1663000	1664000	You got it.
1664000	1667000	You don't have to feel bad about it, but I'm not going to figure out how to
1667000	1668000	make you feel great.
1670000	1671000	I understand.
1673000	1676000	I feel like Mike Tyson is punching my heart.
1678000	1679000	I'm sorry for letting you down.
1679000	1680000	Harmon.
1680000	1681000	I'm sorry.
1683000	1686000	I can't, I can't believe I have to talk to Weiss all by himself.
1688000	1689000	I am.
1689000	1690000	Yes.
1690000	1691000	So we were at channel one on one.
1691000	1692000	That's where you started this.
1692000	1693000	Please tell us more about it.
1694000	1695000	Yeah.
1695000	1700000	Well, I feel actually nostalgic sitting here with, uh, Dan and Rob because I,
1700000	1704000	I, uh, I think a lot of people's stories that got involved with channel one
1704000	1708000	on one, I think a lot of people were in some sort of a personal despair.
1709000	1715000	So I was, uh, I was very, uh, at a, at a place, a breaking point in my life
1715000	1718000	where I wasn't getting where I wanted to be.
1718000	1720000	Can we just have two details?
1720000	1721000	Two details.
1721000	1723000	Wait your ass with a t-shirt.
1723000	1726000	Well, one detail is first I lived in Irvine.
1726000	1728000	That's not a good detail.
1728000	1731000	I mean, if you live in Irvine, that's not a good detail.
1732000	1733000	Shout out.
1733000	1734000	Shout out to Irvine.
1734000	1735000	Shout out to Irvine company.
1736000	1737000	Is that inland?
1738000	1741000	Uh, Jesus, it's Orange County.
1741000	1743000	It's like, like, like juggaloos.
1743000	1744000	Yeah.
1744000	1745000	Yeah.
1746000	1750000	Why would you add like, that's going to really make the story better.
1750000	1751000	Is it inland?
1751000	1752000	Yes.
1756000	1757000	Oh my God.
1758000	1759000	Wow.
1759000	1763000	So many colors and music.
1763000	1765000	It's inland.
1765000	1766000	Oh my God.
1766000	1771000	If I take a flyer on the idea that I don't belong up here,
1771000	1773000	can we stop investigating that?
1773000	1775000	I know I'm a bad interviewer.
1775000	1776000	Is it inland?
1776000	1777000	Is it inland?
1777000	1779000	Did anybody think that?
1779000	1780000	Is that inland?
1780000	1781000	Nobody.
1781000	1786000	Nobody was questioning, ah, is it, is it?
1786000	1787000	Outlander, inland.
1787000	1788000	I guess what I meant was.
1788000	1789000	You got to give me some more, buddy.
1789000	1791000	I don't know what planet I'm on.
1791000	1792000	What year is it?
1792000	1794000	I mean, Jesus Christ.
1794000	1795000	I mean, come on.
1795000	1796000	Is it Tuesday?
1796000	1797000	Huh?
1797000	1798000	Can I get fries with that?
1798000	1799000	Come on.
1799000	1800000	Is it inland or what?
1800000	1803000	I mentioned Grand Theft Auto 5.
1803000	1805000	Is it, is it in the neighborhood that what's his name is in?
1805000	1809000	The guy that stops the guy's head, the, the, the, you know, there's like,
1809000	1814000	you're the, the GTA game where you're the three guys, you know, one of them,
1814000	1815000	one of them.
1815000	1816000	What's the second detail?
1816000	1819000	Like the bald guy, the creepy guy.
1819000	1820000	Yeah.
1820000	1821000	Hey, come on.
1821000	1822000	Hey, what the fuck?
1822000	1823000	Hey, I'm getting there.
1823000	1824000	I'm getting there.
1824000	1827000	So what's detail number two?
1827000	1828000	Oh, geez.
1828000	1832000	Well, watch me make this podcast great by not interrupting.
1832000	1838000	Well, this detail for me was bad, but it was not necessarily like, I feel bad
1838000	1842000	because like I was working in property management for me.
1842000	1844000	It's not the job for me.
1844000	1847000	So like, I'm not putting down the job.
1847000	1850000	It's just like, I hated my job and I hated my life.
1850000	1856000	I was living in Irvine and I did not feel like I was surrounded by similar types
1856000	1858000	of people, creative people.
1858000	1861000	And I wanted to be a writer that wasn't working out.
1861000	1865000	I wanted to get into MFA programs that wasn't working out.
1865000	1871000	So I, one day I got really high and I was watching Adult Swim and I've always
1871000	1873000	been a fan of Adult Swim.
1873000	1883000	And I saw that only two people had animated Aquatine Hunger Force.
1883000	1889000	So then I researched animation software and I just taught myself how to animate.
1889000	1894000	And when I found Channel 101, I became a fan of a lot of the creators,
1894000	1898000	like Twiggers and...
1898000	1900000	And the old baby fucker over here.
1900000	1901000	Oh, Daryl.
1901000	1902000	Come on.
1902000	1904000	We just got out of that drama.
1904000	1905000	Can we just...
1905000	1906000	There's no out of it.
1906000	1908000	So you taught yourself how to animate.
1908000	1909000	Yes.
1909000	1913000	I taught myself how to animate by kind of tracing old cartoons.
1913000	1914000	What was your first software?
1914000	1916000	It was called Digisale.
1916000	1917000	It was really bad.
1917000	1919000	It was really unintuitive.
1919000	1921000	And I was watching Channel 101.
1921000	1923000	I was a fan of the content.
1923000	1928000	And I wanted to be a writer, but I was a fiction writer.
1928000	1936000	And the thing that sucks about being a writer is nobody wants to read what you're writing.
1936000	1942000	So if you make something that you can watch, that is a lot more entertaining.
1942000	1945000	So I taught myself how to animate.
1945000	1952000	And what was cool is I was living in Orange County and I felt a bit lonely.
1952000	1956000	And I began submitting to Channel 101.
1957000	1958000	What was your first show?
1958000	1959000	Do you remember?
1959000	1960000	Oh, my God.
1960000	1961000	It's terrible.
1961000	1962000	It's called Space Goblins.
1962000	1963000	Oh, yes.
1963000	1964000	And I think...
1964000	1969000	Am I mistaken in that people, when that came out, people were like, this is the downfall
1969000	1970000	of Channel 101.
1970000	1973000	I think we said that a lot about a lot of stuff.
1973000	1975000	There's been a lot of downfalls.
1975000	1976000	Channel 101 was like...
1976000	1978000	I mean, I always liken it to punk rock.
1978000	1980000	I mean, that's probably flattering us culturally.
1980000	1985500	But relative to what we were doing, a bunch of nerds making short films, it was always
1985500	1986500	punk rock.
1986500	1987500	So that meant that people...
1987500	1989300	It's like, well, who's doing what next?
1989300	1992860	Oh, this guy just threw his own shit at the audience.
1992860	1997700	And so every single month it was like, well, that's it then.
1997700	2000140	Then now Channel 101 has jumped the shark.
2000140	2003700	And then someone else would say, no, it's just beginning.
2003700	2006300	Everyone was wrong.
2006300	2007700	It was just a great place for people to...
2007700	2009660	How many shows did you do at 101?
2009660	2010660	Can you name them all?
2010660	2011660	Oh, my God.
2011660	2015860	Probably about, I think probably at least 10 to 15, I think.
2015860	2020060	How many of those got picked up for more than one episode?
2020060	2022900	It's funny because like Channel 101, there's a trajectory.
2022900	2027980	Usually you begin submitting, you get rejected, you get better.
2027980	2031940	I felt that I was getting better.
2031940	2035780	And what was cool is because you're competing against your friends, which is cool about
2035780	2041380	Channel 101 is you respect the people that you're up against and you want to make something
2041380	2043380	really good.
2043380	2047140	And I kept trying to make something better, but I think I became...
2047140	2049820	It was always a win-win.
2049820	2053620	Also like you, I'm sure all animation shared this.
2053620	2063380	You and Justin and Sivan and the guys, the animation crews, they suffered always the
2063380	2070900	same kind of curse, which was that you guys are animators, so you're weirder.
2070900	2076540	And so you're making shit that's even more like off the hinge a little bit and people
2076540	2083820	would tend to purposely not vote for stuff because they could tell from watching something,
2083820	2085460	that guy's not going anywhere.
2085460	2088660	He's going to be back here with a new pilot next month.
2088660	2090020	I always voted like that.
2090020	2093140	I don't know if I ever voted for anything you did.
2093140	2094780	And Justin too.
2094780	2095780	Justin would come in with something.
2095780	2097540	It would just be called Skin Scrapers.
2097540	2099860	Hi, I'm Johnny Skin Scrape.
2099860	2103220	Uh-oh, I'm going to scrape my skin now.
2103220	2105220	Oh, the skin's off.
2105220	2108380	Oh, hey, what are you doing with that skin?
2108380	2109380	I'm going to eat it.
2109380	2111220	Oh, no, he's eating my skin.
2111220	2114020	Oh, no, oh, no.
2114020	2116780	And the audience would just be like, this is the fucking best.
2116780	2119300	Fuck you, mom and dad.
2119300	2120580	Fuck you, gym teacher.
2120580	2123340	Fuck you, Jimmy Carter, whoever was president.
2123340	2125340	Jimmy Carter.
2125900	2127900	Shout out to Sprinkles.
2127900	2133180	But it was really like, it was like fuck you, CAA, fuck you, UTA, fuck you, casting directors,
2133180	2135860	fuck you, system.
2135860	2143500	I came out here with a steamer trunk from the Midwest or Irvine, and I'm ready to work.
2143500	2147820	And you would have me just sit out here and put a gun in my mouth.
2147820	2152460	And you deserve what you're seeing on screen right now.
2152460	2154580	That was the real joy.
2155340	2158100	I would never vote for Justin's stuff.
2158100	2159460	I wanted him to make a new pilot.
2159460	2163860	Weisel, how many shows did you make by yourself?
2163860	2170220	How many shows did you make before you got picked up?
2170220	2171620	How many pilots did you make before you?
2171620	2175380	Not very many, because a lot of people's trajectory was that they would start at Channel 101,
2175380	2176380	they would get better.
2176380	2180340	And I felt that I was getting better, but not getting voted in.
2180340	2183100	I was playing a little bit.
2183100	2184340	Past the Pigs?
2184340	2185340	That was, yes.
2185340	2187380	That was like your first, that was your House of Cosby's.
2187380	2190860	I mean, House of Cosby's was successful.
2190860	2194460	No, Past the Pigs got voted back like several times.
2194460	2195460	Was that the first one?
2195460	2196460	No, it got invited back once.
2196460	2197460	Okay.
2197460	2202220	Was that Hot Cross Buns?
2202220	2204620	That didn't get voted back, but I thought that was a really good one.
2204620	2205620	I really like that one.
2205620	2210860	I made this video called Hot Cross Buns, and I thought that it was really good, but I
2210860	2211860	didn't vote for it.
2212620	2213620	Well, let's talk about that.
2213620	2219180	Talk about the relationship between this kind of like willful stupidity, like what I like
2219180	2226300	about you and Justin, it's like somehow, it's like I get caught in like spirals of overthought.
2226300	2229500	It's the death of all fun things and stuff.
2229500	2235580	And then there's like, so my heroes, like Schwab, Roiland, you know, you're carrying
2235580	2236580	that torch.
2236580	2241340	Like, it's like, I'm fascinated by you guys and therefore never want to ask you questions
2241340	2245740	because I feel like I'll just soil you with overthought about like, well, wait, are you,
2245740	2249660	is that bad on purpose or?
2249660	2250660	Like what is it?
2250660	2251660	Don't ask that question.
2251660	2255340	What is the difference for you of like, like, wait, do you make decisions and go like, I'm
2255340	2256900	going to make this a little shittier?
2256900	2262740	Well, I think that's, that's, that's funny because that's, that's never quite my purpose
2262740	2263740	is to make something shitty.
2263740	2267900	He's trying to do is get him a job, high road me in front of these people.
2267900	2271260	You know, your style is obviously like very organic.
2271980	2275540	So when you made this macaroni cheese, you thought, I'll just add these fucking raisins.
2275540	2280220	Is that what you were like, I'm gonna paint this wall and then I'll just smear some shit
2280220	2281220	on it.
2281220	2283060	What is how you do it?
2283060	2287740	What I think it's funny because the hot street season one came out and people were saying
2287740	2294860	that the animation's bad on purpose, but like I was really working hard on a small budget.
2294860	2299660	So it's, it's, it's funny, but you know, they're talking, they're not talking about the quality
2299660	2300660	of the animation.
2300660	2305980	They're talking about the blocking, the choreography, you, you surely must.
2305980	2306980	Maybe you're not.
2306980	2307980	Maybe you're David Lynch.
2307980	2309060	Like, you don't know that you're weird.
2309060	2310580	Is that what we're learning?
2310580	2311660	You don't know you're weird.
2311660	2314100	I, I don't know that I'm weird.
2314100	2315100	All right.
2315100	2316100	Well, that's, I'm glad I asked.
2316100	2317100	I'm a good interviewer.
2317100	2318100	I'm glad I interrupted.
2318100	2319100	All right.
2319100	2320100	Okay.
2320100	2321500	But it's like, I remember like space problems.
2321500	2323980	It was like, I mean, we were rolling on the floor.
2323980	2328440	There was like a process where we watch the submissions and it would be like everybody
2328440	2333440	who won from last month would be in charge of like who their competitors were basically.
2333440	2339040	And so we'd screen all these analog tapes that would be dropped in our mailbox.
2339040	2341000	And I remember space goblins.
2341000	2346480	I remember the introduction to your style, which was like characters that are going like,
2346480	2352400	like they're walking into frame and you use the, the tinkle toes sound effect from Hannah
2352400	2353400	Barbera.
2353400	2358320	And then someone goes, my name is John spaceman.
2358320	2360440	I'm going to go do this now.
2360440	2364240	And then like, and then, yeah, like I kind of like, I would call it like the Doug Lucent
2364240	2365240	Hope camp.
2365240	2369400	Like that, you know, the, the editor from Tim and Eric, who was like, like, that, that,
2369400	2377680	that, that, uh, just pre-millennial, like fucking like late beastie boys, lateral absurdity.
2377680	2382360	See I overanalyzed shit and you're like, Oh, I'm just trying to, my heart, my heart is
2382360	2383720	to do something from the heart.
2383720	2386000	And then everyone's like Harman's fucking evil.
2386000	2391320	He called that guy weird, but you're, you know, you're making, you know, it's funny
2391320	2395840	that the guys like that, that, that, that's not that the, the, the, the, the guys like,
2395840	2397600	what was the name of the show?
2397600	2398680	Give me back my baby.
2398680	2403840	What was the, oh, uh, bearded traveler, bearded traveler, but it was, it was, it was, it was
2403840	2408760	like, it was like the title sequence was like, and then he would say, give me back my baby.
2408760	2409760	Yeah.
2410200	2414120	And it was like a show about a guy who just wanted his baby back bearded.
2414120	2415120	Travelers.
2415120	2416120	My favorite.
2416120	2417120	Give me back my baby.
2417120	2422040	What was nice is like when I made, uh, I made the, I made that show and actually, uh, Justin
2422040	2424520	emailed me on the channel one-on-one forums.
2424520	2429800	I had never met him before to animate, uh, doc and Marty, but I was working on the, on
2429800	2437320	that show and that channel one-on-one show, um, you're kicking yourself, bet you're kicking
2437320	2438320	yourself.
2438320	2440560	Because the guys that animate for him are weird.
2440560	2442720	And look at the bearded traveler now.
2442720	2443720	Bearded Traveler is amazing.
2443720	2444720	Yeah.
2444720	2445720	Give me back my baby.
2445720	2446720	Give me back my baby.
2446720	2450760	And you were very nice to me because I, I, what's that like?
2450760	2458440	I met the, after I met, I met, I think I met Dan before I met Rob, uh, but after the bearded
2458440	2463400	traveler screen screened, you came up to me and you said that you, you thought that like
2463400	2465320	I had a unique style and it meant a lot to me.
2466320	2467320	I swear.
2467320	2468760	You've got a unique style.
2468760	2473160	No, I think, well, you, I mean, you said that you thought that I could eventually have a
2473160	2474160	TV show.
2474160	2475160	I was right.
2475160	2476160	What are you laughing at?
2476160	2477160	I know.
2477160	2478160	I know.
2478160	2479160	I know.
2479160	2480160	I'm laughing at.
2480160	2481160	This dude comes off.
2481160	2482160	He's trying to, he's trying to.
2482160	2483160	I got a unique style.
2483160	2484160	He's trying to, he's trying to.
2484160	2486160	I'm just picturing me in like a crown and a robe.
2486160	2489360	He's like, you have a unique style, boy.
2489360	2493880	He's saying, he said it meant a lot to him.
2493880	2494880	Just take it.
2494880	2495880	I know.
2495880	2501240	No, I wasn't taking away from by, by making.
2501240	2502520	He doesn't even know.
2502520	2504520	He doesn't even know what you think he's got.
2504520	2508960	What you think he's going to say now, of course, of course, he's going to be like, I'm fine.
2508960	2509960	Mr. Harmon.
2509960	2514880	It's like, you just threw me and Joe Green's Jersey back at him.
2514880	2522080	This dude comes and he says, you said something nice to me and you go, I was right.
2523080	2529200	Did I mention my dick?
2529200	2533960	We're probably not, by the way, like, by the way, this is, uh, Weissol.
2533960	2534960	Do you go by Weissol now?
2534960	2536160	Is that like your prince name?
2536160	2542760	Well, that's a good question because all throughout, I mean, no, I've always introduced myself
2542760	2547880	as Brian and people call me Weissol, which is, uh, which is fine.
2547880	2553200	And when I was a childhood, when I was a kid, people would call me Weissol, uh, and
2553200	2556160	in the Rick and Morty's writer's room, I would be called Weissol.
2556160	2562560	And, uh, I think, I think what it was is that, uh, Cass, which was my friend and my channel
2562560	2567280	one on one, the guy who had cast in all of my shows in the early channel, one on one
2567280	2570720	days called me Weissol introduced me to everybody as Weissol.
2570720	2575840	But I always feel really self-conscious about that because like, it feels like branding.
2575840	2576840	Yeah.
2576840	2582040	I mean, Speed Demon Johnson, like I prefer, my name is Brian, but please call me Speed
2582040	2583040	Demon.
2583040	2584040	Right.
2584040	2585040	Right.
2585040	2589000	I always feel really uncomfortable about that, but, uh, I, if you call me Weissol, I like
2589000	2590000	it.
2590000	2591000	It's fine.
2591000	2598520	But like I also go by Brian and, uh, and the, the, the show we're plugging is hot streets
2598520	2599520	on adult swim.
2599520	2601080	It already had a first season.
2601080	2602240	It had a first season.
2602240	2603240	Jesus Christ.
2603240	2606240	Don't run anything.
2606240	2609040	I haven't even seen this fucking thing, but I know one thing for sure.
2609040	2613180	It's got a guy doing tinkle toes and, and like something you, you're going to pretend
2613180	2615800	isn't weird on purpose.
2615800	2622080	It's a good show, but it's like, so you got picked up for a second season.
2622080	2623080	Yes.
2623080	2625920	You got picked up for a second season.
2625920	2630280	I'll really have to, I'll have to sit down and watch Atlanta and then watch this.
2630280	2632160	I used your story circle.
2632160	2633160	Yeah.
2633160	2634160	Yeah.
2634160	2637520	It's just so evident.
2637520	2640580	I'm really proud of the second season of the show.
2640580	2647960	So how do you get it from a channel one, one to adults when, uh, yeah, show us that, uh,
2647960	2648960	show us that ladder.
2648960	2654360	Kate Freund, who is, who is married to Rob shrub, uh, shout out to Kate.
2654360	2657480	Shout out to Kate brave, brave woman.
2657480	2661600	Uh, she, we wish her luck tonight.
2661600	2669880	She passed my name to some people that, uh, that was able to get me.
2669880	2675440	This is really weird because like, I got my break on Smosh, choke up just a little bit.
2675440	2676440	I'm sorry.
2676440	2677440	Thank you.
2677440	2678440	Oh yeah.
2678440	2679440	Got it.
2679440	2680440	Thank you.
2680440	2681440	Yes.
2681440	2684960	Smosh, Smosh, uh, Kate, uh, gave my name to some producers and I got the attention of
2684960	2685960	Smosh.
2685960	2686960	Do you know what Smosh is?
2686960	2687960	What is Smosh?
2687960	2691280	Like, what's it called?
2691280	2694960	It's getting more marketing than, than adult swim tonight.
2694960	2703520	Well like Smosh, Smosh, 10 years ago, it was like the premiere destination for like teen
2703520	2706240	and tween entertainment.
2706240	2711960	And I honestly, I hadn't made fun of them like for a long time because like, I didn't
2711960	2714800	think they were funny at all.
2714800	2725240	And uh, they gave me my break and it turns out that they were really cool, nice people.
2725240	2730000	And I feel really bad, but uh, uh, so I, I, uh, yeah.
2730000	2731000	All right.
2731000	2734720	So we go, uh, we get, we meet people at Smosh, they, they love you.
2734720	2736960	And then how does that go to adult swim?
2736960	2744320	It went from, uh, the, the people at Smosh got me a management and all that kind of thing.
2744320	2752560	And then, um, I was already friends with, with Justin of course, uh, so my management
2752560	2758080	team connected me with Stupid Buddy with, who makes robot chicken.
2758080	2764840	And um, and then we flew, Justin, Seth Green and all of the robot chicken people, we all
2764840	2769720	flew out to Atlanta and pitched it directly to adult swim, which is pretty cool.
2769720	2770720	Incredible.
2770720	2771720	The wrecking crew.
2771720	2773120	That's what I call you guys.
2773120	2774600	Who's Seth Green and Justin?
2774600	2775800	There goes the wrecking crew.
2775800	2776800	The wrecking crew.
2776800	2786040	Why, why so, have you heard about this, uh, um, this, uh, conspiracy theory that Donald
2786040	2787760	Trump is a time traveler?
2787760	2788840	I have not.
2788840	2790440	And I really want to hear about this.
2790440	2793880	Dan, you just, this is fresh in your palette and it's your show.
2793880	2795880	Why don't you explain?
2795880	2796880	All right.
2796880	2802080	Well, there's this author, there's a YouTube video that's like an hour.
2802080	2805360	So you know, it's for real.
2805360	2816560	It's uh, it's called the last president, uh, uh, shit, the last, the last president, what
2816560	2823040	a 127 year old book reveals about Donald Trump time travel and Nikola Tesla.
2823040	2829320	Uh, and I'm only like 20 minutes into it and uh, but it's like, there was a book by an
2829320	2836000	author called what's his name, Ingles Sock, Humper nut, Humper nut, Ingles Sock, Humper
2836000	2837680	nut.
2837680	2840960	Some guy wrote a book in like 1896.
2840960	2848080	He wrote a series of books about a character, a bratty little kid called Baron Trump who,
2848080	2855000	uh, he's like a privileged son of like a dynasty and he, his father's name is Don.
2855000	2857080	Well his mentor is the Don.
2857080	2858080	Oh, okay.
2858080	2865600	But, uh, uh, the, the Baron Trump in, in, in his second book, which is called 1900,
2865600	2874840	the future, the last president, uh, uh, uh, Baron Trump becomes president and, uh, one
2874840	2883480	of his cabinet members is named Pence and, uh, uh, Baron Trump in the book goes to Russia
2883480	2889760	where there's caves that lead to the center of the earth where there's a secret civilization
2889760	2891240	made of silver.
2891240	2896160	Um, they got, the guy interjects in the YouTube video to talk about, by the way, it's worth
2896160	2901040	noting that in these specific caves that are cited in this story, they have found these
2901040	2906640	weird nano fibers that are like inexplicable and stuff like, I'm going to call this guy.
2906640	2910000	Like I really don't want to offend this guy because I really respect, like I'm listening
2910000	2913040	to him and I'm like, I, I, I like, I
2913040	2915120	I'm a believer, I'm a believer, man.
2915120	2921120	I like, like I, I, and I also don't want to offend, uh, uh, anyone who has any, is grappling
2921120	2926840	with any kind of, uh, chemical, uh, uh, complication, like, uh, you just insulted him.
2926840	2931200	Well, no, no, I don't want to tell him he's on smart and I don't want to insult people
2931200	2935040	with brain, but I don't think that the guy is like rat. He's not like Harrison Ford is
2935040	2938320	like coop, just like trying to melt my testicles with satellites, you know, cause I saw it
2938320	2941800	in the, uh, Amway manual, you know, like, like, like, like,
2941880	2948080	Harrison Ford, tell us this, he's not, he's not, he's not, he's not like unhealthily.
2948080	2952160	Like, like he's not, he's not diagnosable in any way. As far as this YouTube video is
2952160	2955360	concerned, he's like, this guy is like clearly like kind of a hobbyist who's like into this
2955360	2960800	thing and like, okay, you're saying no, he's a cuckoo bird, but no, no, no, no, I'm saying
2960800	2965760	move, go on, continue. Well, I just, I just wanted to say, cause I feel, I feel weird
2965760	2970120	when I talk about people that I haven't met and I always want to say to those people,
2970120	2973400	like, if I'm offending you, if this gets back to you, you know, like, and you'd like
2973400	2980160	to come on the show. So it's like, like, like, like, like, like, get to the test, like whoever
2980160	2983600	this guy is, if it somehow gets back to you as it, as it tends to in the most negative
2983600	2987720	of ways, I'm really, I'm not dogging on you and not making fun of you. Like we're very
2987720	2994240	interested in your YouTube video. Um, it is crazy. I hope that's not offensive to you.
2994240	3000960	But this book exists, apparently. I'm not going to read it, but it, I'm sure it apparently,
3000960	3007480	it exists that it was all this stuff. The, the, the Don lives in an, in a, an apartment
3007480	3011880	on fifth Avenue in New York. Well, so Baron Trump goes into the center of the earth tunnels
3011880	3021000	in Russia and he accidentally time travels through time as one does. Yeah. Um, the, then
3021000	3027880	that ties into a story that may be apocryphal or not about Nikola Tesla, who, uh, one day
3027880	3032040	walked into a tavern. Yeah, he walks into a tavern and he's all messed up. His hair's
3032040	3038720	like crooked and he's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, and a friend's like, no test man was Tessie
3038720	3045280	test. What's going on? I said, Oh, there was an accident. And the machine, I was able to
3045280	3051080	see past, present, and future all at the same time. I think I created a time machine.
3051080	3057160	And they went, Oh, okay. So there's that story that's out there somewhere. But, but later
3057160	3066080	on when, uh, Tesla died, the FBI came in and just took all of his stuff, all of his notes,
3066080	3070920	all of his stuff. They just came in and took it. And apparently this is the, the legend
3070920	3073920	or whatever the conspiracy or whatever it was like, they looked through all this stuff
3073920	3079560	and they go, Bill, do you know what this means? No, I don't know what that means. Nigel.
3079560	3083880	And then Bill and Nigel were two guys there. I love it. Yeah. And they didn't know, they
3083880	3087000	couldn't decipher what it was. They weren't, they said, well, let's get some smart, the
3087000	3092520	smart guy to come in here and take a look at this. And the guy they hired was Trump's
3092520	3103640	uncle. As the, as the legend goes. And so, so do they have this machine? Uh, yeah. Well,
3103640	3110160	the proof is they said that the guy eventually says, I think it's that video who says, well,
3110160	3117760	time travel affects your mind. It screws you up. It makes you, it deteriorates your brain.
3117760	3123000	And that's why Trump talks the way he does. It's because of time, time travel. And that's
3123000	3129920	why he misspelled, uh, a Baron Trump's name. Cause there's two R's in the book. And so,
3130840	3136640	I'm sure it's like Donald Trump. We're just watching. We're at the, we're at the end of
3136640	3147120	a world that has been, uh, retro, uh, uh, pre, uh, retro, pre destroyed by a time traveling
3147120	3153360	nincompoop who, and, and he, he, he probably doesn't even remember how to time travel anymore.
3153360	3159440	So now he's just, he was an idiot and didn't care about not fucking up time. This is the
3159440	3166800	world we would be living in. Cause he's, and it kind of explains a lot more than if, if, if the
3166800	3173600	stuff didn't exist, I can now, it reminds me of the Ford and the, the Lincoln and the Kennedy
3173600	3182160	thing, which is Kennedy was killed in a Lincoln. Lincoln was killed in Ford's theater. Right. Both
3182240	3186640	had shots to the head. Um, both fucked Marilyn Monroe.
3188720	3193840	Second, someone had a secretary named Johnson. One had a Johnson named secretary.
3195520	3201280	Well, this is what the conspiracy theorists say that the Illuminati or the powers of B or whatever,
3201280	3207840	that they're, they're, they're putting all these clues being out, out in the open because they're
3207840	3213200	arrogant. They're like going here. Look, doesn't Biff Tannen that's like the spackle on the logic
3213200	3216720	of conspiracy theories. It's like, well, why would they, cause they're fucking with us.
3218320	3223840	Thank God the Illuminati are always just fucking with him or we wouldn't be able to explain quite
3223840	3228800	all of this. Yeah. Yeah. Covers a lot of plot holes. Yeah. I liked, I liked, I watched the
3228800	3235760	Illuminati videos where they show like, um, like just a montage of like celebrities, uh,
3235760	3241280	in moments of like mind lapse or whatever. When the reptilian eyes show or, or just like,
3241280	3245040	just like the craziness though, like the, like, like, like, like Will Smith's talking and then he,
3245040	3248480	and then like to go like, yeah, but so when's your next movie coming out? And he just goes like,
3252720	3257120	anyway, and then they just do that. You just watch 45 minutes of that. Cause,
3258160	3262400	but it's like, it's like, like, I like, I like, it's like, like, I think that's this,
3262400	3266320	that might be a healthier hobby for a middle-aged man than toy trains.
3268080	3275040	Like, yeah, think about how the world might be fucked up and engineered to manipulate you. Like,
3275040	3281040	like, like don't, don't just recede into a, a, a, a, a digital app and like try to make a squiggly
3281040	3285840	cartoon. All right. Let's, let's get to know you a little bit. What do you think? What do you think?
3286560	3287680	What's your take on all this?
3292320	3297280	I'm going to a new area. I'm going to talk about weezer because like I find myself,
3299120	3304080	I find myself like, do you find yourself just getting really mad? And you're like,
3304080	3309280	I'm online and I'm like, I'm listening to this really bad Africa cover and I get really bad.
3309280	3313760	That is some bullshit. Can we say that? That is some bullshit. Yeah, it's some bullshit.
3313760	3321280	Don't fucking remake it and take out all the fun. So yes, it's like, but also at the same time,
3321280	3327360	like I get really mad at the internet. I get real, I just want to rage and, and, and like,
3327360	3335520	I fucking hate this Africa remake and I hate the Rosanna one is even worse. And, uh, and I just
3335520	3342240	want to go on the internet and just, just talk about it. But at the same time, like everything
3342240	3349040	has become so black and white that like, it's like weezer fucking sucks. They've never been
3349040	3352960	good. And then I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3352960	3355600	Can you go back to talking about the baby stuff?
3356560	3360240	I'm trying to get away from there. They're going to fucking burn the building down.
3362800	3367600	And then like, you're watching and then like, I was in my car and then the sweater saying,
3367680	3372160	came on and I was like, this sounds pretty good. They're not like complete shit, you know?
3372880	3378560	So like, nothing's great anymore. Everything's just like attack or defense. Nothing is kind of.
3378560	3386640	And also like 15 years from now, like it, it, you just don't know, like somehow, some way
3386640	3394960	your opinion about weezer, it may somehow like dent you, right? Or am I, that's not what you
3395040	3399440	were leading to at all. And I'm just like stuck in my own like fucking weird world over here.
3399440	3406480	Well, I mean, I think I'll continue to dislike weezer, but it's not that they're completely
3406480	3411920	evil, horrible people that need to be destroyed. It's just, they made, they made a song that's
3411920	3418400	and maybe an album or several albums that suck really bad, but they're not like evil people.
3418400	3423360	Right. Okay. What is the biggest change for you since this is a weird question,
3423360	3429360	but since you did sort of quickly move up the ranks, what was the hardest thing to get used to
3429360	3435760	for Dan? For Dan, it was being famous for you. What is it? He's 48 by the way. And, uh,
3436320	3440240	okay, I'm sorry. I'm pretty close to that because we just found out that's feasible,
3441680	3446560	but it took, it took a little while. It took a while, but then once it started, it,
3446560	3452640	I'll say like, when I got my first job as a writer, I was 37 and I was Rick.
3452640	3457760	Jesus Christ. You really are really old. Yes. Yeah. So like, that was my first job
3457760	3465360	was my first professional writing job was Rick and Morty. Uh, and I was 37 and I think my, the,
3465360	3471600	the, no matter what age you are, when you go into a writer's room and you're brand new,
3472480	3478080	you're inside of your head. So I think like, uh, you're in the writer's room and you're like,
3478080	3485280	I haven't talked enough today. Or you get kind of get inside your head too much. And now, uh,
3486400	3489920	toward the end of the season, I felt like, all right, I know how to contribute to the show.
3489920	3494880	And now I'm on a show and I worked on a couple of other shows after that. And then hot streets,
3494880	3501120	I'm running the writer's room and now I see all the bad habits that I was doing. Like,
3501120	3507280	give me one. Like, uh, it's like you're waiting for your turn. You're like, somebody is, is talk,
3507280	3512400	is, is giving an idea. And, and they stopped talking. You're like, and then you go backwards
3512400	3517440	five minutes ago. Cause you're in your head. You're like, all right, if Rick and Morty, like, if,
3518480	3524880	if they, if they did this, then, um, that was a great pitch, right? Um,
3526080	3531680	you get inside your own head, I think is the problem. And so when, when I became, uh,
3531680	3538880	uh, the show runner for my show, I saw that happening with, with, I've seen that happen
3538880	3544160	with other and others, not just hot. I mean, Jesus, the writers and hot streets are incredible.
3544160	3548960	So I'm not, I'm not talking bad about them. Um, but I've worked on other shows since Rick and
3548960	3556080	Morty were like, you see that happening and you want to, I think the key is to just succumb
3556080	3563040	yourself to the show and to, uh, embrace what is happening and to build up what is happening
3563040	3567760	from other writers. You want to help them because the greater good is the show. But when you're a
3567760	3571360	new writer, I think the problem is you get inside your own head and just want to like,
3571360	3579200	I've got my own ideas. I want to put my own voice in the show. I think that's okay. I, I, I, I, I
3579200	3584240	envy you if what you are achieving is like an actual exercise where people are just keeping
3584240	3591600	the shuttlecock in the air. And so you're not even bothering to like, but, but, um, if that
3591600	3596320	is one extreme and the other extreme is nobody listening to anybody and they just have their own
3596320	3603360	ideas somewhere in the middle is kind of like, yeah, as long as you don't shoot down other
3603360	3608400	people's ideas, that's what makes me just go, fuck you. Like, like, like, like, like, like,
3609200	3613360	you're sitting there listening to other people's ideas and trying to figure out why they won't
3613360	3622240	work. Dude, I ideas don't work because God hates us. We're here to beat him like, like, like, like,
3622240	3626080	don't you're on the wrong side of the law. If you're sitting here trying to figure out how that
3626080	3630240	person's pitch isn't going to work. I don't care if it's about boogers or fucking whatever, like
3630240	3637520	support it until it dies of overindulgence. Um, but ideas are a gift, but I think it's okay. I mean,
3637520	3643120	I've done well for my money and my shitty writer's room that probably works much slower than yours
3643360	3647600	is like, I don't mind people ratcheting back a little bit and going like, well, listen to that
3647600	3654720	person talk for four minutes trying to get their idea out. And I, but what I wanted to say about
3654720	3659280	what we were talking about is this other thing. Like, I don't, I just, so you know, I don't,
3659280	3664560	I never saw that as a sin. I would expect that. I don't, I don't, I wouldn't want people to leave
3664560	3670080	shit behind in a ditch just because Timothy like decided to make everything about Wizard of Oz.
3670080	3674240	I agree with you. And I would say like ideas are a gift, but I felt like when I was working
3674240	3679680	at Rick and Morty, I felt that I was too inside my head. Right. You, you caught yourself not
3679680	3685040	listening to other people enough is what you're saying. Right. And when, um, I've worked with
3685040	3693280	people, not just writing, but like I, uh, season two, we were able to kind of, uh, I guess the
3693280	3698880	problem going from season one to season two is season one, as I don't quite know how to be,
3698880	3706560	how to run the show. So I've got certain lieutenants that I'm listening to and, um,
3706560	3711360	and they're just going to stab you in the back and go do a fucking Marvel show. Okay. All right.
3712480	3717760	All right. Oh my God. You happy for your friends for once.
3718880	3725760	Be happy. We're all fucking trying to figure it out. Somebody did something nice happens to
3725760	3733760	somebody and you, you got to tear them down. You got to tear them apart. Jesus Christ. What's
3733760	3740560	wrong with you? I just said, Waldron was there for two weeks. I like, I got to, I got to, I got to,
3740560	3748320	I got to train people slower. Oh my God. I got the fire. He did the work. He got the job.
3748320	3754240	Be happy for him. What don't high road me. What are you doing? How dare you? No one's happier
3754240	3757440	for him than me. You, uh, you know, a little bit because you're running your second season,
3757440	3761040	right? That's, that's going to be your show running. Do you, what would you tell him? Because it's,
3761040	3767280	uh, what would I tell who low low key? Oh, what would you tell Brian? Because he took
3767280	3771840	sense. I can't tell him anything. Well, he just said he's not so sure. Is there a piece? Because
3771840	3776320	I like, it's cool about this show is that you do talk about the process and I do think people
3776320	3782560	want to know how it all gets made sometimes. Yeah. But it's, I mean, it's a goddamn nightmare.
3782560	3789520	I, I, I, I, for me, the central thing about it is always, uh, the, uh, wondering when you're
3789520	3793440	supposed to be overthinking and when you're supposed to be underthinking, uh, especially
3793440	3799040	in a show like Rick and Morty, where it's like, you know, to me very clear that it's the, the,
3799040	3804960	the, the, the key recipe is that it's a swirl of two things that don't usually work well together,
3804960	3813280	which is like willful stupidity, uh, and, uh, and, and absolute, like passionate, like over
3813280	3820640	thought. And I, and I, so we sit in the writer's room and we, we, I don't know, we try to break
3820640	3825440	stories, but we also like have these at the top of every season. We go, let's do things real
3825440	3830240	differently this time around, you know, let's, let's, let's escape this process and let's do
3830240	3836400	another one. And it's just this two to three was a whole different room. Yeah. I mean, they're
3836400	3840560	always, they're always, they're always real different rooms and you're, it's everything's,
3840560	3845840	the experiment is never over. You're never comfortable. You're never nailing it. You
3845840	3850160	never, it's like, you just dream of this day. It's like the myth of retirement,
3850160	3854560	like the myth of the writer's room that like ha like has its shit together where you're like,
3854560	3858240	okay, well we know what our job is. We make pizza, right? People like the cheese,
3858560	3863520	tomato sauce. Oh shit. All of the unexpected things have to do with our babies and medical
3863520	3869280	emergencies. I gotta go home at four instead of five. It never happens. It's always like,
3869280	3876720	okay, you're, you're behind schedule. And, and why did this story about a banana peel turn out to be
3876720	3883680	our citizen Kane or Ishtar? Like, what, what are we doing wrong? It's funny because like,
3883680	3890080	whatever brings you like joy in the room, like for us, we were in our writer's room.
3891360	3893200	Man, I don't know how to talk about this, but like,
3895280	3902640	uh, I guess there's this, there's this, uh, sexual fetish of people liking, uh,
3902640	3908560	like cartoon horses, like partying, partying on people's faces.
3908560	3914000	Well, hanging out every word waiting for you to the joke is bringing it back to the
3914000	3918880	thing that everybody, what's that? What's the term? What's the term? What's that? What'd you
3918880	3924160	like? If I wanted to Google, I don't know. It's not what, I mean, like I was just like,
3924160	3929280	you know, we, we, in our, in our room we were watching, like for us, like you just follow
3929280	3937520	whatever the joy is of the moment. And for us, and I like horses. Yeah. But cartoon horses are
3937520	3945200	even better. If you like, you know, if you are aroused by my little pony's farting in faces,
3945200	3951120	that's totally cool. But like it's some fetishes are kind of amusing at the same time. Like what?
3952960	3960880	Like the pony's farting in faces. Also, Pokemon is a big on the farting on people.
3960880	3969040	So like the videos start with like either the My Little Pony or, or the Pokemon slowly approaching
3969040	3975040	backwards to the create to the character. Right. And I feel like they, I feel like they start with
3975040	3984160	a lot of self hate. Um, so get up on that mic. So tell us about that room. Tell us about that room.
3984160	3989920	So we were like, we have to write an episode, but it has to be serious. Like if the pony farts in
3989920	3996000	your face, you die. So it's like the things that make you laugh in the room oftentimes will, uh,
3997520	4004480	help create that story. Yeah. I don't know. That completely went away from what we were talking
4004480	4010800	about. Yeah. I don't, I mean, look, I, it's a conversation about a thing that is so frustrating
4010800	4016960	for the same reason that it's like the conversation about it is almost tedious, let alone inaccessible.
4016960	4021200	Cause it's like, that's the problem. And I've always agonized about this cause I'm like,
4022000	4029440	hopefully going to retire soon. And, um, I spent my life, um, working,
4029440	4035680	I'm going to go ahead and say it as hard as a carpenter works with wood, but with stories.
4037120	4042640	Oh, fuck you people. No, but I mean, like I've said it over and over again. It's like the fucked
4042640	4047600	up thing is that from the, from the beginning of the first moment, when two people got to two
4047600	4055520	pieces of wood and said, let's make a porch. Like the first time don't, don't act like I don't know
4055520	4064240	architecture. Uh, the first time that they figured out just two pieces, they start on the porch,
4064240	4072720	Brandon, you don't, that's the fucking steps. The first, how did they know what it is? They've
4072720	4079040	never made it before. That's my point. What's a porch? Well, do you got a piece of wood? That's
4079040	4084320	my point. Well, those will be the steps. So we got to get some more wood to make the porch. You
4084320	4092800	can get online right now and type. I need to make a porch into Googlepedia and you will be able to
4092800	4102400	draw on 5,000 years of people making shit with wood, right? Because every time a joist gets
4102400	4107840	invented or discovered, there's like racks of shit at home depot and there's time life books
4107840	4112800	and there's people sharing notes and, and when things don't work, they don't make the cut and
4112800	4116720	they, and they, and they evaporate. So when you have something as simple as like making a house
4116720	4121040	that people live in or making a porch swing, you have this like mimetic evolution where people
4121040	4126400	compare notes and share what they've learned and with breaking stories, which to me is agonizing
4126400	4132960	and no one wants to do it. I don't want to spend eight hours a day knowing only one thing, which
4132960	4140400	is that I don't know what to do next. It's like, what, fuck you, man. I'm entitled to more than that.
4141680	4148400	I want a Sunday and a hand job right now. Okay. Like, like, like, like, when his story, like,
4148480	4153600	like my, my, my, my career is like propelled by this like will to laziness. Like, and then I
4153600	4158320	never, I'm like, there's gotta be an easy way to do this. Joseph Campbell must know. Okay. Jesus
4158320	4163760	Christ. This guy talks a lot. Oh fuck. God damn it. Okay. Maybe if I break it down, it's like,
4163760	4171040	I never like, like I can never figure it out. I can never work smarter, not harder. It might,
4171040	4174640	that's why I'm so frustrated also by the technology involving interactive whiteboards,
4174640	4178560	which I know we have, but we don't have because there's no demand for it.
4178560	4184080	Like we, there's, we're in the golden age of television. 144 pieces of wood
4187200	4188640	is what it takes to make a porch.
4192080	4199680	No, to run a writer's room. What do you think? What were we talking? Yeah. All right.
4199760	4207120	All right. We should be able to know like how, like I, I, I, like if, if I, if I could go back
4207120	4216880	in time through a Russian tunnel and, and simply just be able to access from 2009 onward, all of
4216880	4221280	the work on every single community episode and Rick and Morty episode, like just be able to look
4221280	4227600	at just the strokes on the whiteboard in order and all that stuff and be able to like pour over that
4227600	4232560	with the same amount of facility that we can pour over our baby's photos, our, our weddings
4232560	4237360	and stuff like that. Like we have the digital technology, but we don't, we, we, we somehow
4237360	4242320	regard this idea that writers work in writers rooms. We regarded as if it's some kind of like,
4242960	4246240	there's like this blind spot there where we're like, well, that's none of your business,
4246240	4251040	how we get our shit done. But it's like, wait a minute, man, we're all working towards like
4251840	4256720	a common goal here. If you figured it out, how you can do it in two minutes, then we could start
4256720	4262320	accelerating our, our television culture, right? Like, like true, but all artists do that. All
4262320	4266480	artists hide their process, which is interesting that you let us in. That's why I was always trying
4266480	4271680	to push because if you, you use joists, but the truth of the matter is with carpentry, the joinery
4271680	4277120	is hidden. So like some dudes are not using metal at all. Some dudes are using just pegs.
4277120	4281520	Some dudes are just using a dowel. There's always this thing of like, if you look at this stage
4281520	4286320	right now, you don't see a nail because carpenters don't show you how they make stuff. That's the
4286320	4291680	game. That's what the masons are built on is the, well, the masons, that was their first impulse.
4291680	4295600	I was like, wait, oh, are you thinking around? I'm thinking, yeah, we know how to make a doorway,
4295600	4301280	not fall on your head when you over the door. Well, fucking how about we keep this from people
4301280	4305920	until the next election? Yeah, you're right. That's where's first instinct. And to be honest,
4305920	4309360	even when you're painting, you're trying to use paints that nobody else can get their hands on.
4309360	4313520	If you don't like that impulse, I don't like it. And I don't think it's because I'm a noble person.
4313520	4317200	I think it's because I'm so fucking much more narcissistic than other creatives.
4317200	4322080	I actually, like in my head, and I think this is changing now. I'm 46, but I think I'm like,
4322080	4328960	I think in my 25 year old, like max land to see brain, I think that weekend, not this weekend.
4330880	4336800	The, I think that like my goal has always been like, let's just eliminate all this fucking shit
4336800	4341200	that has nothing to do with talent and then just have a fucking dick measuring contest.
4341520	4348800	It's like, who came out of the womb more special? What's with all this Michigan getting in the way,
4348800	4352960	you know, like, like how hard it is to figure this and that out. Like, I don't think that way
4352960	4357280	anymore because it's like, it's like, it's like digging through a cotton candy mountain,
4357280	4363440	like looking for a, you know what, bad writer. Like, where was that going to go?
4364960	4370160	What I could use is a good room full of talented collaborators that I wish I knew how to use.
4371120	4376320	Did you go through a process why Saul or speed demon is where we've come to call you. Like,
4377040	4383840	my big lesson on community was that I threw this like idea of, well, I don't want to be an asshole.
4383840	4389760	So I'm not going to make them do anything, which is abusing them. Like, did you, I don't know how
4389760	4395600	big your writing staff is. He had a pretty small writers room. We had, I think like five writers
4395600	4400000	and all. So did you ever do this thing where you're like, hold up and going like, I'll just
4400000	4409680	write the script. You guys eat some M&Ms. It would, it was usually, I mean, like even on Rick
4409680	4414480	and Morty, I think I felt like the first couple of hours is just kind of like dicking around,
4414480	4421520	you know? And then you just eventually, actually, like I used to, I was listening to Armantown and
4421520	4428640	then when I got to Rick and Morty, it was just kind of like dicking. It was kind of like, you know,
4428640	4434160	what happens on the show? Yeah. I think there's a little bit of warmup that occurs.
4435040	4442560	Yeah. Yeah. So you're just kind of having fun as a, as a group. And sometimes you'll find something
4442560	4448480	that sparks pleasure and you try to find what that pleasure is and how to get to it and how to like,
4449440	4453120	I think in season two was a get schwifty song. We all thought it was funny.
4453680	4460320	Like, how do we write a story for that? Because that brings us a lot of pleasure. Yeah. Yeah.
4464000	4469760	Yeah. Never nailed it. There's no formula. Don't know how to do it. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that's
4469760	4477600	why artists and carpenters try to hide what they do? Because if we knew, if we saw, like to me,
4477600	4482160	like I always tell my parents or people who aren't in the business, if you saw what I did,
4482800	4487280	if you looked at what I would do, you would go, you're doing nothing. You're just fucking around
4487280	4492080	all day. But it's not true. I mean, like when you're not writing, you're thinking about writing
4492080	4497040	or you're outlining or you're writing or whatever, or you're, you're, you're doing a lot of, you're
4497040	4503440	basically doing it wrong until you do it right. And you do it wrong. I mean, the funny thing is,
4503440	4508160	yeah, I know that, I know that like hat, like, like I have my older brother's voice in my head
4508160	4513760	when we're taking two hours to get started. Cause we have so much to talk about and it's like, wait,
4513760	4517520	when are you guys going to ever do anything for a living except sitting there and fucking
4517520	4523200	jerking each other off. And then, but then I also, the same voice in my head, as soon as we get
4523200	4529520	started for the next four hours, it's like 20 minutes into it. I know every ghost in my head,
4529520	4537360	like I feel all of them snap. And they go like, this is ridiculous. Why are you thinking about
4537360	4545280	this for so long? Just have fun. It's just a good show. He has a booger ray. Every lesson you've
4545280	4551360	ever learned is about having fun. Why aren't you ruining it? Stop ruining it. You're ruining it.
4551360	4555280	Stop. You're overthinking it. And then, and then you go like, I'm not going to overthink it
4555280	4558560	anywhere. I'm like, what if he just had a booger ray? And then you're just like, okay, he's got a
4558560	4562480	booger ray. Like, oh, he's right there. Write the scene. He's got a booger ray and he's got a booger
4562480	4566960	ray and he just read it. And everyone goes, and maybe sometimes you even just go all the way
4566960	4571360	through therapy and you go like, fucking just keep it moving. He's got a booger ray. Draw it.
4571360	4578400	Draw it. Draw the booger ray. And then they like draw it. And the musician goes like booger ray
4578400	4584320	theme. Here comes the booger ray. And then the editor like pieces it together and everyone's
4584320	4588720	got bloodshot eyes in there. I was like, here it is. And they press play. And it's like, hey,
4588720	4595760	Rick, Morty, whoever you are, I got a booger ray. I'm going to pull it out. Here's the booger ray.
4595760	4600560	Zap, zap, zap. Oh, geez, Rick, you really shot good with that booger ray. Yeah, I did, Morty.
4600560	4606400	Didn't I? I really did. I really shot good with that booger ray. I always do it. 100%. 100% with
4606400	4611360	that booger ray. 100% booger ray. 100years.com booger ray. Oh, that's great. Yeah, that's great,
4611360	4616800	Morty. That's great. That's great. Three minutes later. And then they press pause. And now you got
4616800	4627680	two EPs at the top going like, oh, seems to lack a little something. Yeah, but they don't want to
4627680	4635120	call it the part where we agonize in the writer's room because that makes everyone mad too.
4635120	4644000	Uh, let's figure out how to fix it. I don't, I haven't figured it out. Well, I think because
4644000	4650160	I'm working on a like 11 minute show, I can, we can do the book booger ray episode, you know,
4650160	4656320	and it's not, it's not the 22 minute word. Man, he's stealing your idea. Yeah. Season two,
4656320	4662880	episode one is the booger ray episode. We stole it and it's coming out. Well, let's punish Justin
4663440	4670480	like, because we got, we, we, we'll, we got Golden Folds voice here. I'll do Rick and Morty.
4671520	4682480	Um, you can be the voice of, uh, Celestra, the ice queen. Um, and, uh, Weissol, you do, uh, uh, uh,
4683920	4692240	Rubik, the amazing cube. And we'll improvise an episode of Rick and Morty. Okay. Okay. Here we go.
4693040	4699520	Oh shit. We lost our Golden Fold. Hold on. Let's get him, get him lubricated. Just like at work.
4704720	4711200	Yeah. Is there as much drinking going on in the writer's room? Uh, not at hot streets.
4715520	4716480	I don't drink at work.
4716480	4723760	Before two.
4727760	4731120	Sorry. Before we start was, uh, Rubik kind of like the, uh,
4731680	4735840	he was an amazing kid. Did he sound like Howie Mandel from gremlins? He kind of did. Yeah,
4735840	4739040	but you don't have to do that. He's more of an Emmanuel Lewis kind of, uh,
4739760	4747920	character, a connoisseur. I mean, I was just ripping something, but you like, uh, okay. Fade
4747920	4756720	in interior, uh, Rick's garage, uh, date. Uh, gotta put this, uh, transistor inside this, uh,
4756720	4763520	compactor. Hey, Rick, uh, do you think he could give me a new prom suit for the prom tonight?
4763520	4768800	Morty, I'd rather eat glass than ever indulge in your adolescent fucking rituals. You piece
4768880	4776160	of shit. Everything you believe is a lie. Uh, okay. Well, his mom said, uh, uh, that you,
4776160	4780640	your mom says a lot of things, Morty. Uh, she said yes. When your father said, would you like
4780640	4787360	this in you? Uh, I think that says enough about her. Um, if I, if I ever dabbled in time travel,
4787360	4791920	believe me, uh, a lot of problems would be solved. We wouldn't be having this conversation.
4791920	4798480	Rick, are you extra drunk? Yes. Uh, I just, all I wanted was an extra, uh, prom, prom suit.
4800320	4805440	All right, Morty, look, fine here. This serum, if you pour it on yourself,
4805440	4811520	it'll turn your clothes into whatever your mind thinks is important. That's the bee story.
4815600	4819920	It's low stakes. Hopefully it'll generate a lot of bits with, I'm saying summer.
4819920	4826160	Uh, you know, she's on the payroll. I got to use her. Go, go, go. Go talk to your sister about
4826160	4833360	clothes while I deal with what I'm working on on this bench. Uh, Golden Fold enters the open garage.
4837600	4844400	I smell poop. Hey, uh, Golden Fold, uh, can you, can I use your finger for a second?
4844960	4849440	I need an extra hand. I, I, I was just extra mean to Morty and I, I needed some assistance.
4849920	4855440	Sure, but you're not going to pull my finger, are you? No, no, no, no. I have a flatulence
4855440	4860640	problem. I'm way more sophisticated than that. Just put your finger here and hold down that
4860640	4869280	button. And no matter what you do, don't wish, uh, uh, uh, that wishing was impossible.
4870560	4877760	I was just wishing that wishing was impossible. What have you done? You created a new story.
4880800	4891120	Wow. Welcome to my domain. What the fuck? Shit. My portal gun. I left it on the toilet again.
4891120	4892720	There's no need for portals
4895840	4899200	or guns here in my domain. Please have a seat.
4901840	4907760	Two chairs out of nowhere. How did I do that? Please tell me that you want to probe me.
4907760	4915920	I want to probe you. Is that how you say hello? Meanwhile at the Smith house in the bee story.
4916800	4920960	Hey, uh, summer, uh, Rick told me to, uh,
4920960	4925920	occupy you in a scene that has to do with me pouring a serum on my clothes.
4925920	4932000	Hi, I'm Rubix.
4935360	4938800	When you poured that serum on you, it created me.
4942400	4950400	And I am here to stay and Rick and Morty. Oh geez, Rick must have given me a serum.
4950400	4958800	They must have mixed them up and, and, uh, now I gotta, now I got a Rubik.
4958800	4963280	If you put me to shape correctly, I'll grant you a wish.
4964000	4969920	Well, that's no problem at all. I can do that for sure. I saw, I watched PewDiePie do this all the
4969920	4976400	time. I think my generation, I watched, I watched videos about people reacting to videos about Rubik's
4976400	4983200	cubes. So here we go. I did it. I made you the same color on all sides. I grant you one wish.
4986800	4995680	Jessica cut to back to Narnia planet. So that's when I found out I was adopted. That's,
4996800	5001520	that's such a, I'm thank you for sharing that. That was a wonderful story.
5001520	5005520	That was really great. Here, have some more ice muffins. Oh, delicious.
5007120	5013760	Hey, ice queen. How come my, my, my body is turning into, uh, uh, uh, ice? That's because
5013760	5020000	you're sweating too much. Are you, are you hiding something? Is he hiding something? Oh,
5021680	5024720	I think you're hiding something. Why don't you, why don't you have a seat
5025520	5030240	before you completely freeze and kind of just let something off of your chest, just like,
5030240	5034880	just like your friend did here. Just, just let something off of your chest. Let it off.
5034880	5041200	We really gotta get out of here. Oh, oh, there's something about this Narnia mushroom. That's
5041200	5048480	making it easy to release my thoughts. Oh, my father. Oh, my father. You just said something
5048480	5055280	about your father. Let's, let's, let's probe that. My father took me on a fishing trip.
5056240	5059840	Oh, he threw me out of a boat.
5062880	5070960	I didn't know how to swim. Oh, I was sucked down into the muck. Uh, I had a regular eyebrow
5075360	5082320	and regular hair. And then a caterpillar climbed onto my forehead at the bottom of the lake.
5082960	5092240	Gave me my trademark unibrow. And then my hair became spiky as I moved up through the water,
5093360	5099200	which was next to an alcohol plant. And so I became an alcoholic. That's why I drink.
5100000	5106320	And my clothes, the color was bleached out of them by the alcohol and the water. So I came out
5106320	5112240	of the lake, uh, looking like, uh, all of the qualities that my character has.
5114960	5118000	That's, that's fascinating. We'll be right back.
5120720	5123600	Ben gay foot cream makes your foot less
5124720	5131760	hurty. Hey, my name's Ben. Let me cream on your foot. Uh, oh, fuck.
5131760	5136560	Reach for the solution that counts. Reach for Ben gay. Oh, oh, that pony.
5136560	5142480	This Sunday at the Toronto truck show, all trucks all the time in Toronto. There's the
5142480	5149440	Daisy plus 40 foot yacht. Come meet David Hasselhoff and the cast of, and I'll be seeing you at the park.
5154080	5157120	Do you have doing my own taxes?
5157120	5165680	My name is tax Johnson. I'll do all your taxes. Call me. I'm Spanish. Abrigado.
5169920	5175680	We now return to rig and Morty. Oh, shit. Fuck. Oh, ice queen. This is so good.
5176400	5180480	God damn fucking me in the butt with that icicle strap on.
5187360	5191120	Meanwhile, in the story,
5194720	5198800	Oh geez, summer. Oh God. All right. All right. Let's put a little wrapped up there.
5202320	5206720	That's just a, we just started to punish Justin for not coming. Like he thinks, he thinks,
5206720	5214000	you know, having too much edible is a bad. Yeah. This is, is this cannon is this? Yeah. I mean,
5214320	5221200	I have at least 50% of the right to say that's it. Now we know how Rick got his eyebrows.
5223040	5228000	Actually, there's one thing I wanted to talk to you about. Like, oh, shit. Real behind the
5228000	5235040	secret secret. Here we go. Do you think like, cause I've, I've been getting into like anime lately
5235040	5241840	and like, I know, I know. And then giggled and giggled at the same time.
5242640	5249920	But like, what do you think about like giving too much information about a character? Like,
5249920	5261680	cause like I've been, I've been re tired. I've been tired. But, but what do you think about this?
5261680	5266160	I think it's a terrible idea. I don't, I'm not being glib. I don't think I, because I think that,
5266240	5275040	that's a, our, our friends don't have origin stories. I like, we learn things about them
5275040	5280000	that makes sense when we look at them as a whole, but we don't, we don't learn the, as much as we
5280000	5286960	enjoyed the river Phoenix opening to Indiana Jones, the third movie, it also simultaneously,
5286960	5292800	we were watching Indiana Jones die. Like we were getting too much information. It, it,
5292800	5298240	that's how I feel about that stuff. When I was watching season three, episode one, what I was,
5298240	5306720	what I was feeling is that because there had been so much, so much talk about
5309600	5317440	what had happened to Beth's mom, that it had become a bigger mystery than it maybe is because it
5317440	5324480	ended on a cliffhanger. Uh, to me, like when episode three or season three came out episode
5324480	5331360	one and you're like, it's all about Szechuan sauce, which I thought was hilarious. But like,
5332000	5338960	was that to diffuse that whole, like, cause like people are wanting, uh, I thought, yeah,
5338960	5344000	you have to undercut any efforts made in that area. I think you provide both. You give people
5344000	5349760	the option. I think there's like 35 different categories of TV viewer. There are people who
5349760	5356560	relentlessly, uh, catalog. There are people who, who, who hate what they love. There are people
5356560	5363280	who ship. There are people who hate shippers. There, there, there are you, but all of them represent
5363280	5367680	like some small part of what you experience when you watch a TV show. And I think that the
5367680	5375920	responsible thing in terms of craft person ship, you're welcome ladies, uh, mid-word, mid-word
5375920	5381040	inclusive 90 degree fucking move. Didn't even, and didn't stop the show and point it out.
5381040	5386240	Don't break your arm. Happy February. Don't break your arm. Pat yourself on the back.
5386960	5393920	Fucking woke, woke AF hashtag. Um. Oh my God.
5394560	5397280	I love that your hashtag is backwards.
5398880	5404080	I put the, put the hashtag on the end. Motherfuckers gonna die. Hashtag. Wait,
5405600	5411680	wait a minute. Um, what the fuck was I babbling about? I don't know. Oh God. We're in the black
5411680	5416800	house. Giving it a too much, giving too much backstory to a character. It's not about willful
5416880	5422880	denial of it either. I don't, it's just, it's, it's about respecting everyone's right.
5423760	5429120	Right is a strong word because I hate everyone and they don't have rights to material, but.
5429120	5434000	Well, you've said this before and maybe I've read this other place in other books I've read
5434000	5440880	about writing is like start the story as far into the story as, and let it be Doctor Who,
5440880	5445760	which Doctor Who evolved naturally, but they accidentally found what I think is the way
5445760	5452240	to survive post golden age TV with a franchise, a modular franchise. Now look, serial TV is great.
5452240	5455920	I love, I love Russian doll. I love, I love it. I love it all. I love that Groundhog Day is a
5455920	5462800	genre now. It's fine. Um, like, like I, I will, I'm, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna end up being
5462800	5468960	serious. I'm too old. It's too late for me. Like, like modularity is like that feeling of like,
5468960	5472800	that's my family. I can come home to them anytime I want. They're always there.
5472800	5477760	Aunt Jackie's always a fucking drunk. Maybe there could be an episode where she's not a drunk.
5479120	5483280	If that fucks up your show, it's because you didn't design aunt Jackie's character, right?
5483280	5491440	Like, cause nobody's character is that they're drunk. He said, uh, whatever. But, but like,
5491440	5495200	I mean, I, yeah, I mean, I, like you triggered a thing that could make me talk for three hours.
5495200	5501040	I actually want to talk, what do you think? Cause I think like one of the greatest black holes of
5501040	5507760	drama right now is the mystery box theory of storytelling where you keep teasing the audience
5507760	5514880	and then you at the end, it's just a bigger mystery. It's kind of like lost. It's lost.
5514880	5518560	But that we see where that goes. They say, I think that's like painting yourself in a corner.
5518560	5524000	There's a, there's a tweaked version of mystery box, which is mystery buffet or where you keep
5524000	5529360	opening it up more and more. You keep giving people more and more options. You don't, you never deny
5529360	5534320	anything. The first rule is that if it's canon, it's canon, you can't, you don't move back on it.
5534320	5540080	You never say, well, you, you perceived that wrong. We didn't, you know, you just keep adding more
5540080	5545920	things. You're like a, you're, you're hosting a party. You go, you go like, Hey, who wants to get
5545920	5551840	high? They just invented ketamine. So I have it now. Like you, you always stay on top of everything
5551840	5557760	and just like, like there's a room in every house for every type of person. There's a room in your
5557760	5562960	party for people who hate parties. That's when you're, that's like, like, that's if you're a good
5562960	5568560	host, like, like, like, there's just plants and a dog in here, man. Just relax. Like I, I, I hate
5568560	5577680	everyone else too. That's cool. Like, and yeah, I, I said, like, it, it, it, that's no, no, like,
5577680	5582720	oh, this is going to pay off one day. Like I would hate to make that promise. You know,
5582720	5590320	hang on everybody. There's the one, our man again. It's going to hang on. That's why you
5590320	5594400	should enjoy the show. You don't, you don't want to cross that threshold of like, this is why
5594960	5600320	it seems like it's a little disingenuous. It's its own trick, which is to trick people. I think
5600320	5603360	when people sit down and they want to hear a story, they want to hear a story and they want you to
5603360	5609200	go from A to B. If you go, I can't, I feel like that's like the equivalent of throwing sand in
5609200	5615760	a fight. Like I feel like when, when, when broadcast television started competing with cable
5615760	5620080	television, that's when serialization and cliffhangers started happening. That's when event
5620080	5624880	television started happening and there's good, good stories that emerge from it. And there,
5624880	5632080	but overall it's like, how can I compete with American Idol if I'm just Knight Rider? Well,
5632080	5640320	the answer is Knight Rider has to go, I just committed incest with to be continued. It's like,
5640320	5644080	like, you have to tune in. You have to, you have to, we're not even going to finish making
5644080	5649520	television until you tune in, which I think is like not, but I think, I think like, like Breaking
5649520	5656000	Bad did it like really well. Like that's like, like that to me was like binge TV before Netflix
5656000	5663440	made it a thing. I hated the ending. Well, well, I mean, I would, I would say like shows,
5663440	5669360	you know, I guess I like shows that in the finale of that season, they kind of tie up the mysteries,
5669360	5673840	like the, the wire, like when you get to the end, it's like, that's the season, right? You,
5673840	5678800	you feel nourished. Like that's the story and it goes down and feels good. I like that they both
5678800	5686400	law and order and X-Files where they intersect is that both shows delineated between mythology
5687520	5693520	energy and modular energy. So law and order was the extreme of it. Cause it's like, they don't
5693520	5697440	want to lose a single viewer to the idea that you have to know who these people are. So they just
5697440	5702080	let you get addicted to Jerry Orbach. Like, of course you should. He's a, what is it? What is
5702080	5707280	a character? He's a raincoat. He's an eyebrow. He, he give the actor some credit, you know,
5707280	5710720	like, like, like that's where they're going to fall in love with. So just let him like rate
5710720	5716000	your stories. You're a writer. Like, like, like give these people something to do so that if
5716000	5721200	you watch one episode, it's like smoking a crack rock, which is yes, connected to all other crack
5721200	5727600	rocks, but not necessary to smoke that crack rock before that crack rock. That's the difference is
5727600	5736640	like crack is the goal. So, uh, and I, and I love, like, I always, like, I watch, I watch law and
5736640	5742000	order and syndication on TBS and I was like, I was like, I got so fucking hooked after like five of
5742000	5746400	them. And I'm just like, God damn, I love Jerry Orbach. God damn, I love this and that. And like,
5746400	5752160	never anything, no plot, nothing except for the one self contained plot of the homicide that
5752160	5758960	happened and the solving of it. And then at the end of the season, um, the Lieutenant, uh,
5758960	5766400	like Jerry Orbach's like, uh, well, uh, guess, I guess, uh, I guess that crowbar murderer found out
5767360	5778960	not to pry. Uh, and, uh, I made it up and it's like, and then, and then the Lieutenant like stops
5779040	5783760	him as he's about to leave the door, but he goes like, Hey, and he turns around and she goes,
5784640	5793600	how's the drinking going? And he goes, yeah, one day at a time. And then he walks out, dick wolf.
5793600	5800640	Yep. That was an entire season. That was all you learned about Jerry Orbach, unless you like,
5800640	5804480	but then it like makes you go, you gobble it up. Sorry, I'm babbling, whatever.
5804560	5809840	No, no, it's a good point. But, but X files did this, a similar thing with the smoking man stuff
5809840	5815680	where it was like, like if they had been able to hold that line, which I'm not, like just that
5815680	5820880	idea of like, you know, every time it's like, all we wanted was give me more about smoking man and
5820880	5825200	what happened to Fox's sister and all this stuff. And it was like, how could they ever resist
5826000	5829840	like giving us more and more of that? But every time they gave you more of that, you're like,
5829840	5833120	you're losing something. It's like ballast or something. And it's like,
5833120	5836400	you want to like keep that shit up there. Um,
5836400	5841200	is that how you play event centered versus character driven against each other in the
5841200	5845040	course of a season? I think I could just say yes to that question, but I don't,
5845040	5849040	I don't know. I'm not sure I understand that. It was like Twin Peaks. The minute, the minute
5849040	5853360	they said, okay, this is what happened with Laura Palmer. The show was over with, but they went on
5853360	5859920	another season. Like you want to keep, you want to keep the stuff that's it's not the destination.
5859920	5864080	It's the journey, you know, with any of these shows. I mean, Nick, I can't,
5864960	5868560	you want to entertain that fantasy that you can do something else, but that's why I was obsessive.
5868560	5874560	That was my big rift with Sony for the three years it took to fire me on community was that I was
5874560	5879760	like, yes, this is a great show. Yes. My goal is to make it fucking amazing in a way that would
5879760	5884960	make you want to watch a thousand episodes of it. But in order to do that, we have to acknowledge
5884960	5890560	that we, we made a deal with a certain chronological devil. We said that Annie Edison
5890560	5895680	is a child and that she's growing up. We said that Jeff winger is paying a four years price for,
5895680	5901920	for who he was. We're telling a story here. Like we have to get out in front of this thing so far,
5901920	5908640	so fast that no one notices that we stopped having to go to community college because at some point
5908640	5913840	we're going to have to. Uh, we, we, we, we, and like Sony would get so mad. They'd be like,
5913840	5918720	what are you talking about? Watch fucking welcome back Cotter and shut the fuck up.
5919600	5925760	Watch mass. You dumb asshole. The show was 11 years longer than the war and everyone's rich.
5926320	5932000	Why are you burning our money? Stop making television for Reddit.
5934480	5938320	And I was like, it's not going to work, man. We're not going to be able to say it's Halloween for the
5938320	5946400	90th time in a row. And Alison breeze, like, oh, the forbidden fruits again. Like it's,
5946400	5950880	it's a four year story, but yeah. Anyway, I'm sorry. I got like, let's get out of here.
5952240	5954880	You triggered fucking your Vietnam vet dad.
5957840	5963680	I pretended to be dead. They mounted a tripod on me. All this because somebody dropped a plate.
5963760	5971920	Calm down. Why Saul, uh, hot streets, uh, every mystery that is introduced
5972720	5978640	will get revealed in the, by the end of the season. Remember when they were not be tricked,
5978640	5983200	the history of television, someone will note that like, like NBC like peaked at this point where it
5983200	5990480	was like really literally at a show called the event. It was, I was like right before
5990960	5996000	80% of you were like even invested in anything because it was like you were born on Netflix.
5996000	6000800	And so you're kind of like, but like there was this point where it was like the squeezing of
6000800	6006400	the sponge before everyone was like, fuck it. Who's on shark tank? Like, like the, uh, they were
6006400	6010320	like, they were like green lighting these crazy series. Cause it was like the idea of event
6010320	6016720	television. And that's so what an NBC God bless their sincere dopey heart was just like, well,
6016720	6023680	then literally let's just make a show called the event. And there's like, if you go to the
6023680	6027600	commercials, cause they had this like a whole teaser campaign with, they, they, the teaser
6027600	6034320	campaign was them explaining to you what the show wasn't because it was about payoffs. So they would
6034320	6045760	go, the president getting assassinated is not the event. Why am I leaving the white house?
6045760	6055440	I'll tell you on the way. The concert exploding is not the event. You were supposed to tune into
6055440	6061600	the show to find out what the event was like television reduced to breakfast. What was the
6061600	6070240	event? What was the event cancellation after six episodes? The event was a lot of guys that work a
6070240	6075600	lot less harder than I do getting a lot more money. I don't want to be bitter. They smack this
6075600	6083360	kid at a backyard barbecue and told the slap. Yeah. And it's told the slap is the event. Yeah.
6084400	6090240	It's told from everybody's point of view to find out whether or not Betty is ugly.
6093040	6099840	Uh yeah. What am I doing? Like, am I job is to know what to say next? Everyone knows I don't
6099840	6108480	February 24th and midnight hot street. Who are you having on the season? Any major super
6108480	6117280	celebrities? This is Hollywood. We've got, oh, we've got Ernie Hudson. Yeah. I like the black one.
6117280	6121360	You know, when you watch season one of always, it's always sunny. Like I remember watching,
6121360	6125200	I think this show's really funny. And then Danny DeVito, Jen's a cast and they're like,
6125200	6130480	holy shit, the show. It's weird to watch the first season. That's how I feel like with Ernie
6130480	6135600	Hudson. Why, why? So I heard this story. Um, maybe you can confirm this and share an animation
6135600	6143200	buff and your friends with Ernest Hudson. Uh, I heard during that when they did the real
6143200	6149600	Ghostbusters animated series that Ernie Hudson auditioned for Winston, but lost it to our
6149600	6154480	Senua hall. Is this true? That is true. But I mean, I'm speaking for him, but I've read, I've
6154480	6160560	read interviews with him where he, he auditioned for the part. But wouldn't we cast him? His voice
6160560	6166640	is so powerful that I think what happened was like, you had all these voice actors that are
6166640	6173520	really funny and talented, but Winston would be the head lead character because he's so, his voice
6173520	6180880	is so fucking powerful that you can't ignore it. So I think they, I feel like in the movies,
6180880	6186000	what Winston was kind of something weird happened. Yeah, it's kind of weird. Like he's not really in
6186000	6191280	the movie. It's almost like he was over empowered maybe by virtue of like a latent racism. I'm not
6191280	6195280	trying to high road anybody. It was the eighties, but it was like, I remember being a 10 year old
6195280	6199600	kid, a 12 year old kid watching Ghostbusters. It's like he had a flannel shirt on, he smoked cigarettes
6199600	6204320	and his first line is like, look, as long as there's a steady paycheck involved, I'll believe
6204320	6211760	anything you say. And he was like very, did that skirt the line? Until we get shut down.
6213840	6222240	The month of February has shut you down. But he had that kind of like, albeit maybe equally
6222240	6226240	problematic, but from a completely different direction where he was the empowered, he was
6226240	6231520	powerful. And then Ghostbusters two, in addition to all the other weird things about it. Also,
6231520	6236080	cause I just, he just did an interview recently where he was talking about Ghostbusters dude,
6236080	6240640	I didn't realize this, but in Ghostbusters two, they do this thing where they catch up with all
6240640	6246640	the characters, but they don't catch up with Winston. Like they just, he just comes back in
6246640	6250640	the middle of the movie. Like everybody has their own like business and stuff like, and then
6251600	6260320	yeah, I, yeah, I, that's documentary worthy. Okay. All right. Anybody watching that
6260320	6266160	Lorena Bobbitt documentary? No, I do remember it though. I am with it. I got, I got started,
6266160	6270400	I started to get that's the name of the documentary stick with it. Stick with it.
6271840	6278000	Stick it back on. I swear. Like, like, like, if you're like, you get to a point where you're
6278000	6282640	like, this is the 90th time they've explained to us that these people have backstories and I don't
6282640	6289200	care, but like toward the end of that thing, like it gets so deep and intense. Like, uh,
6289200	6295520	it's, it's really weird for me, especially like, uh, because your dick was cut off. I just remember
6295520	6300720	being, uh, uh, working in a blue collar city and doing improv. Like we're familiar with the Bobbitts
6300720	6305600	as a word that everyone would shout out as a suggestion for a comedy show that we wished
6305600	6312000	that they would not because we were feminists because we were snobs. We're like, shut the fuck
6312000	6317200	up. We're not doing another goddamn sketch where I mime a dick getting cut off. Fuck you. Fuck you.
6317200	6323600	Fuck you. So that's all I ever knew about the Bobbitt thing. And it, you know, it's very
6323600	6329760	interesting. Like, uh, it's a, there's a documentary series that they, they unpack it for like 10 hours
6329840	6335840	of, uh, it's worth it. By, by the end of it, I'm telling you, you'll have like synapses that are
6335840	6340640	like, uh, reformed. What is the takeaway? What's the craziest thing that you learned that you didn't
6340640	6349360	know back then? Uh, how our facility to ignore abuse. I mean, I, I really don't, it, it, it,
6349360	6354800	both like it as a culture, like, like the way that we can like focus on the things that are like,
6355680	6363680	fuck it. Now the women are shutting us down. The patriarchy I think is now the, like, like,
6363680	6367520	it's just like, it's like, oh, she cut his dick off. So that's interesting. You got our attention.
6367520	6371760	Yes. You, you cut a dick off. So you have her attention. Excuse me. What, what? She cut her
6371760	6376320	dick off. Okay. Uh, uh, and, and then it's like, and then it's like, this sort of like, this like,
6376320	6382000	you, you really come away with it with a, with a, with a complete feeling of like, look, there's
6382160	6388800	a lot more to it than just the dick getting cut off. The unfortunate people who long since before
6388800	6395120	that were like, does anyone want to talk about equal rights and the, uh, spousal abuse problem
6395120	6399600	and all this things like, and then this weird portal happens where it's like a woman cut a
6399600	6407040	guy's dick off. Everyone wants to talk about penises and abuse and battery and rape. And then
6407040	6412880	these, these well-minded people who are like, okay, great. So now let's talk about this and like
6412880	6419200	the kind of tragedy of like, well, no, I mean, we want to talk about dicks and cutting off and
6419840	6425920	like, we want to, we like tablet celebrities. We don't, but it's not a downer. I think it's a,
6425920	6429040	it is the beginning though. Right. Of sort of like that celebrity.
6429040	6433120	Well, it's time it's, it's, it starts, it starts a con, you know, it's like,
6433120	6437440	before that you literally couldn't say the word penis in a, in media. You couldn't say the word
6437440	6442240	penis in New York times, like things like that. Like, uh, uh, so it starts, it starts a thing.
6442240	6446480	It's, it's, it's worth watching. Uh, anyways, I don't know how to end a show. So I thought I'd
6446480	6452080	like recommend a Netflix thing. Uh, we saw, uh, what do you recommend? Better be fucking not
6452080	6456960	self-indulgent. Better be high-minded. Uh, I'm going to recommend JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,
6456960	6462640	the anime that I'm currently, uh, infatuated with. It's really funny and cool and, uh, it's crazy.
6462640	6467600	I remember you recommended to me, what was that Titan fucking like giant star fighting Titans?
6467600	6470240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I recommended the first season of Attack on Titan,
6470240	6477200	but Dan watched it without the subtitles. You know what I mean? It's not the same show,
6478960	6482240	but the second season, you know, they kind of blew it a little bit.
6482240	6485040	I just want, first season's amazing. First season's nice.
6485040	6489280	Your pitch was too good. You were like, there's, for some unknown reason,
6489280	6493280	there's naked giants attacking the world. And I was like, I wanted that show.
6494720	6498400	Yeah. You don't know how to trust a dude who was looking for like unicorn fart videos.
6501280	6505040	All right. Well, uh, uh, it's, it's, it's about that time.
6505040	6510160	It's time for everybody to start dreading Tuesday. And so we end with our, our traditional song.
6510160	6520640	It's been a good show. You've got your voice, a voice thing next to you.
6521680	6522480	What the voice.
6526000	6527840	It's been a pretty good show.
6531440	6532160	What you pay for.
6534720	6536640	Don't know what the tickets cost.
6540720	6545600	God knows it wasn't as much as you'd pay for a bottle of cologne,
6547280	6554960	which will just make you feel more alone. Sure. You smell great, but for him. And so
6560720	6561600	what a great show.
6570160	6577600	Yeah.
6585440	6586800	More than just a suggestion.
6589040	6590640	Literally told you what to do.
6590640	6592000	It was MC generic.
6593600	6595360	I mean, he did have a point. Like you said,
6600320	6601680	show me all the blueprints.
6604560	6607280	I'm upset with how we do it. I want to know.
6607280	6610240	I got to control everything. It's how I live and grow.
6610240	6615600	I'm a control freak obsessive compulsive. I fucked up. I was so hard. My dick was repulsive.
6615600	6621600	Oh, it came out to form John Wayne. That's what we were talking about before.
6621600	6626320	Yeah. Stitching back on. Then I got a career in porn. Then the abuse is back on.
6626880	6631760	I turned into a woman in a small theater.
6632880	6636400	Just rhyme any word. It's okay. Let's end the show.
6638480	6639600	Black history
6643920	6646480	is the history for me.
6649360	6653040	I prefer black history.
6653040	6657200	I'm going out on that limb.
6659920	6662800	If you take me to a history store.
6664080	6664960	Oh, sorry. Sorry.
6667280	6669600	Oh, sorry. Okay. All right. Good night, everybody.
6671600	6672880	That has been harm in town.
6673920	6676240	Brian, why saw why saw speed?
6676240	6678640	David drop Zack McKeever.
6678640	6682240	The lovely church. Sarah Hill.
6683600	6686080	No, I'm for because who am I forgetting?
6687360	6687840	That's it.
6690080	6693200	Good night, everybody. I've been Brandon Johnson.
6693200	6697280	Drive fast. Take chances. We'll see you next week. Good night.
6708640	6716320	Did you get any of that?
6718000	6722080	It's a good show.
