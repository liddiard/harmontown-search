57000	65000	Gonna rap downtown, gotta, I fucked your mama.
65000	70000	I was trying really hard, I was just explaining to the cameras in the green room.
70000	75000	I was like, okay, I got nothing, I'm not gonna say fuck your mama.
75000	80000	I want to scrape my brain like dry toast and just like, yeah, well, it didn't happen.
80000	83000	I just rapped about rapping better.
83000	85000	But that's a good first step.
85000	89000	Like they say, if you want to quit drinking, first step is to go, I drink too much.
89000	90000	Was it the beat?
90000	93000	So I'm saying right now, I rap a lot about fucking your mama.
93000	95000	Maybe next week it'll change.
95000	96000	Do you think the relation...
96000	98000	No, that beat was badass.
98000	99000	No, you liked that one. I was worried.
99000	101000	Yeah, no, that one was really good.
101000	102000	Yeah.
102000	103000	I really liked it.
103000	104000	Was there like a banjo in there?
104000	107000	I don't know if there was a banjo in there.
107000	112000	I felt like I kept picturing Kermit the Frog on a log, like fucking...
112000	115000	Yo, yo, yo, yep, Kermit, yep.
115000	118000	Gonna catch the flies, I'm in a swamp now.
118000	120000	Gonna muppet fries.
120000	122000	I can't do it.
122000	126000	I'm thinking too much about fucking people's mamas and like...
126000	128000	I won't be able to do it.
128000	133000	Let's not start the show cataloging my inadequacies.
133000	137000	Let's talk about Christmas.
137000	140000	Woo!
140000	144000	Santa Claus is here tonight.
144000	146000	We got gay Santa Claus in the house.
146000	151000	Look over, you see a very tired Cupid.
151000	154000	I thought it would never end.
154000	156000	Wait, no, that comes after Christmas.
156000	157000	God damn it.
157000	160000	You mean Cupid from Valentine's Day or Cupid the reindeer?
160000	164000	Yeah, I was further confusing.
164000	168000	I meant from Valentine's Day.
168000	171000	Just edit it all out.
171000	177000	This will probably be our Christmas show because we're like seven weeks behind
177000	179000	in terms of when we record and when we broadcast.
179000	183000	I don't listen to him.
183000	186000	The master does his work and then steps away from it.
186000	187000	That's nice.
187000	195000	It seems like a bigger crowd tonight.
195000	197000	Maybe it's because Chevy Chase.
197000	202000	No, I'm kidding.
202000	203000	That was mean.
203000	205000	That was just mean.
205000	209000	I told you guys he called back and he wanted to do it, but he couldn't do it.
209000	210000	Did you call him today?
210000	211000	You said you were going to call him.
211000	212000	I texted him.
212000	214000	He couldn't do it.
214000	217000	I also, hey, while we're at it, I also texted Bob Odenkirk.
217000	220000	Also, cannot do it.
220000	223000	Also, Sid Caesar couldn't make it tonight.
223000	225000	But hey, I fucked your mama.
225000	226000	I got a fucking mama.
226000	228000	I fucked your mama.
228000	230000	I fucked your mama Godzilla style.
230000	234000	I fucked your mama all the while in the Sherman town.
234000	235000	I got a fucking mama.
235000	237000	I got a super tie.
237000	240000	I got a fucking mama all the living time.
240000	242000	You got a new dance.
242000	243000	There's a new dance.
243000	244000	It's not just side to side.
244000	248000	Now you got a front to back little kicky thing going on.
248000	253000	It's the, I'm afraid to look at the audience dance.
253000	260000	I think I might have, here's the thing, like at the pikey, I rarely do this, but I over,
260000	266000	underestimated, I ordered too many drinks.
266000	269000	I didn't calculate it right.
269000	275000	So if I were a pilot and this were an airline, you would, you should get off the plane, but
275000	276000	you only paid $10.
276000	280000	So I promise I will try not to make it awkward, but drink more than you would normally drink.
280000	281000	You just did it too quickly.
281000	282000	Yeah.
282000	283000	I think that's what it was.
283000	284000	Yeah.
284000	288000	Because the service there was, uh, was so bad glacial, so bad that I, when the guy came
288000	292000	out, it was, it was so bad that I kind of passive aggressive.
292000	296000	It was like, yeah, I'll have two more and the bill.
296000	300000	You ever do that when you're like, well, these things take so long.
300000	302000	Give me three now.
302000	306000	And then they'll come like when I want them.
306000	313000	And then they all came and I was like, but I have to admire the fortitude that you've
313000	317000	showed by pouring yourself another one in the green room right before you walked out
317000	318000	on stage.
318000	319000	That's just habit.
319000	320000	You know why?
320000	321000	That's why.
321000	322000	Yeah.
322000	324000	I mean, really that's habit.
325000	326000	It's not funny.
329000	335000	I've been, I've been kind of stressed out by, uh, it's, uh, six days before Christmas
336000	343000	for me on the, uh, 17th of December, uh, Aaron McGathey and Rob shrub and his girlfriend,
343000	347000	wife, Kate Freund and I, uh, leave for London.
347000	351000	So December 17th, that's well after everybody shuts down in Los Angeles.
351000	353000	And so I, it's December 10th right now.
353000	354000	Something around there.
354000	364000	I, uh, I have six days to write a pilot for CBS, a pilot for Fox and, uh, pack.
365000	370000	Got to pack, got to pack some fingerless gloves and, uh, and, and research figgy pudding.
370000	374000	Aren't you the guy that was just boasting that you wrote heat vision and Jack in 36
374000	375000	hours?
375000	378000	Yeah, that was a different, much more joyful time in my life.
378000	381000	That was when I didn't know the rules of television.
381000	382000	I don't know.
382000	383000	I don't know.
383000	384000	Whatever.
384000	385000	I'm not, I'm not.
385000	387000	What are the rules of television, Dan?
387000	389000	Uh, always be closing.
389000	390000	Right.
392000	395000	Uh, uh, think dog.
395000	397000	Could there be a dog in it?
400000	406000	Uh, and, and, and when possible, ask yourself like, like, what would this be like according
406000	408000	to Jim?
409000	412000	I don't, I don't know what the rule, you called my bluff.
413000	414000	Congratulations.
414000	415000	Call.
415000	417000	I don't know how to write television.
417000	418000	I never have.
419000	422000	Uh, but, uh, you got six days to write.
422000	424000	Six days to write two pilots.
424000	426000	Oh, there's a TV show.
426000	428000	Dan Harmon's got six days.
428000	429000	That's a movie.
429000	430000	That's a movie.
430000	431000	But that's more of a Bravo.
431000	432000	Yeah.
432000	433000	Yeah.
433000	434000	Like, maybe it'll be fun, but.
434000	435000	Don't look down at Bravo.
435000	437000	You're going to be writing for Bravo one day.
437000	440000	I'm going to be writing for Bravo January.
440000	445000	Right when I come back and, and, and Fox and CBS are going, hey, welcome back from London.
445000	446000	What the fuck?
447000	449000	And I go, sorry, I got to go on tour.
450000	451000	Okay.
451000	452000	What I, we have two notes.
452000	454000	You're fired and you're never hired again.
455000	456000	Okay.
456000	459000	I'll address that in Minnesota.
460000	461000	Doesn't matter.
461000	462000	I don't care.
465000	467000	Christmas.
468000	469000	I'm stalling.
472000	477000	Saw the Avengers movie for the second time, but actually for the first time, because I kept sleeping through it.
477000	479000	Actually, I liked it a lot.
479000	481000	I don't know who I'm talking to.
483000	489000	Maybe not 92% rotten tomatoes liked it, but I like the Avengers.
489000	490000	Okay.
490000	491000	Done.
492000	495000	Also, I'm not going to roll into one.
495000	498000	That's going to, that's going to put a barrier between us.
498000	500000	He's the second of three.
500000	503000	Also, I was quite fond of the total recall remake.
503000	507000	I thought I was a, I don't know if you call it a remake or not, but whatever.
507000	513000	I was starting to, starting to ruffle feathers, but I think it can coexist with the Verhoeven classic.
513000	515000	I thought they were both good.
515000	520000	Like, uh, I liked watching Arnold run around Mars with the women with the three titties and the,
520000	521000	give the people their air.
521000	523000	And I, I also like watching what's his name.
523000	528000	Uh, not know that what's his name was not his wife and what's her name actually was.
528000	532000	Uh, that's why my one note is all the women look the same.
532000	538000	Uh, but I have what used to be called Asperger's and which has now been removed from the diagnostic manual.
538000	541000	I'm, I'm slightly autistic.
541000	544000	So make one a redhead.
544000	549000	If you're, if your movie has two women in it, always make one a redhead or make a Maria Conchita.
549000	551000	Maria Conchita Alonso something.
551000	560000	Um, the, uh, uh, now here's, here's the point where we just, you know, we, we reach an impasse and we'll work through it.
560000	565000	I liked cloud Atlas.
565000	568000	I would say, I would say Harman town 50 50 on that one.
568000	569000	Yeah. Okay.
569000	573000	So a total recall that kind of was, okay, I put that in the wrong order.
573000	574000	I like to call it Atlas.
574000	575000	It was, it's, it's, it's weird.
575000	578000	Like every, you're never more than five minutes in cloud Atlas.
578000	581000	Cause there's a lot of, for those of you who haven't seen it and I won't spoil anything.
581000	583000	I don't know if it's possible to spoil anything.
583000	587000	It's the, it ends revealing humanity is amazing.
587000	591000	Uh, and goes on forever into the stars.
591000	596000	But, uh, uh, if you think about it, that's what green eggs and ham revealed.
596000	605000	So, uh, no, no, no big road to ho there, but, uh, I, I, the cloud, cloud atlas and because their whole shtick is reincarnation,
605000	609000	I'm assuming it's based on some book series that made, made a better meal out of this.
609000	613000	So then it's time to commit it to film and you know, like, well, we gotta, we want to create the sense.
613000	620000	So there's all, there's all these people are being reincarnated and that we're all kind of intersecting with each other and playing different roles in our lives.
620000	625000	There's a lot of prosthesis, a lot of, a lot of like, a lot of like six actors.
625000	631000	And then there's like, you know, Tom Hanks will be like hanging out as a fisherman going like, it's hard to catch this fish.
631000	639000	And then like, it'll go like, uh, uh, Geneva 1814 and he's like playing a piano, but he's got like a weird nose.
639000	643000	And, um, but, but then Holly Berry comes in, even though she worked on the fishing dock.
643000	645000	But now she's like, you better compose that concert.
645000	658000	All right. Um, every time, every time they come in, they have a different forehead, a different, like, like, they have like, like zany zappers on or like, uh, like a, like a weird chin.
658000	666000	You're, you're never more than five minutes in cloud Atlas from going, and that's not what you're supposed to do.
666000	675000	The cloud Atlas, you're supposed to spend the whole time going, oh, but you're constantly going.
675000	682000	Would it have been more or less jarring to just cast different people in those roles for us to catch on that that was the reincarnated?
682000	685000	Well, you never would catch on because there's too much to tell about.
685000	695000	I bet in the, in the move, in the book, I'm sure you don't need rubber noses and the same actor to indicate to you that this person, I have no idea.
695000	700000	Did anyone read the book or book series? We got it. We got a, we got a, we got one hand.
700000	705000	We have two, two gals here have read the book. All right. Is it? I don't know what to ask.
705000	708000	Somebody gave me that book years ago and I feel like it's true.
708000	718000	I liked not reading the book more than not seeing the movie.
718000	728000	I made a joke. I joke about a book.
728000	732000	Please resume, Dan. No problem.
732000	737000	If you want to say where I have nothing to say, that counts out of the bag.
737000	744000	Sorry, I got you drunk tonight. I'm going to make it up to you. You seem exactly as drunk as you are every harm in town.
744000	750000	I guess I can tell. I don't know. I always like, I always, I have nights where I'm like, they can tell.
750000	756000	Like I, and I, and then I project that on to like, if I'm talking and I go like, hey, come on, it's Christmas.
756000	762000	Hey, what's the deal with ornaments? And then I'll hear like, oh, and then I'll go, she knows I'm drunk.
762000	769000	She knows I'm too drunk. So I'm not going to look at her. But that was a guy.
769000	778000	You pointed to the guy. Drunk. Can't see anybody.
778000	787000	It's all because of the waiter at the pikey. Another interesting thing about the pikey, if you're a local, we can edit this out because who in Boston is going to care about this.
787000	793000	But go over to the pikey. It's Kinney Corner-ish from here.
794000	798000	He used to be the Coaching Horses and then it turned into this place.
798000	804000	The big highlight for me is alternate timelines. Geevy Jeff Davis works there.
804000	812000	There's like a guy, if you ever go in, he wears like these beige suits and he looks a lot like Jeff.
812000	818000	He kind of like spends too much time on making his hair look like he didn't spend any time on it.
818000	822000	But if he was from like 10 years, he's from like 85.
822000	827000	Yeah, he's vaguely, very vaguely multi-ethnic. Like you don't know where from where.
827000	831000	Like his mom worked on the docks. His dad was a minister.
831000	834000	Mama used to work on the docks.
834000	838000	But yeah, he's a very creepy, very creepy version of Jeff Davis.
838000	843000	There's also a very lovely guy up front. There's a black dude named Hallelujah, which is an awesome name.
843000	845000	Yeah, Hallelujah is a good name.
845000	849000	This seems like cheating in the name.
849000	856000	I mean, okay, my name's awesome. Let's all just go fuck ourselves.
856000	862000	My name is Butterfly. Like some of us have to hunker down and be John or Hallelujah is not cool.
862000	870000	But I don't want to jump all over this guy. Never met him. Already jealous.
871000	874000	Oh shit, you're fucked up.
878000	881000	Should I pick you a slower beat to rap to?
881000	886000	A slow beat to rap. Like a slow regretful rap?
893000	899000	I feel like maybe would, you know, I usually go with the stationary mic stand,
899000	903000	but maybe I should loosen up so that you can't tell.
903000	908000	I think the mic stand helps you know how drunk I am.
908000	912000	But if the whole thing's moving, then you can't tell.
912000	915000	Right? I seem sober now.
915000	922000	Give it some of that Dane Cook karate moves, you know. Dane Cook it up.
925000	928000	Let's try the slower beat.
929000	931000	Yo.
931000	934000	Yo. Slow rap.
934000	937000	Yo. A slow rap.
937000	940000	Yo. A slow rap.
940000	943000	No, that didn't work.
943000	945000	You just kept saying slow rap a lot.
945000	947000	Well, I worked my way into it.
947000	950000	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
950000	952000	Slow rap.
952000	958000	Look, if you're just going to keep saying slow rap, I will clear this room.
958000	960000	All right. I need to start a meeting.
960000	964000	Okay. No, no, no, no. Ease into it. Ease into it.
965000	967000	Slow rap.
967000	969000	You've made that quite clear.
969000	970000	Am I allowed?
970000	971000	Yeah, yeah.
971000	972000	Slow rap.
972000	974000	Yeah, go.
974000	976000	Slow rap.
976000	978000	Cities coast to coast.
978000	981000	Gotta motherfucker knows the most.
981000	984000	Gotta put your mama on some toast.
984000	987000	I gotta go to fuck your mama's ghost.
987000	991000	I gotta because I fucked you to death.
991000	994000	I gotta did too much crystal meth.
994000	996000	I fucked you.
996000	999000	I fucked your mama to death and then I fucked her.
999000	1001000	I fucked her harder to death.
1001000	1004000	I gotta fuck your mama in a slow rap.
1004000	1008000	I gotta fuck your mama slow as crap.
1008000	1011000	I gotta fuck your mama all over the stage.
1011000	1014000	I gotta fuck your mama I'm a third level mage.
1014000	1018000	I gotta put your mama crystal cast in a spell.
1018000	1021000	I fucked your mama up from heaven to hell.
1021000	1024000	I fucked your mama like my name was Snoop.
1024000	1028000	I fucked your mama in the butt and felt poop.
1033000	1034000	No.
1035000	1038000	Weird. There's a disconnect here.
1038000	1039000	No, no, no.
1039000	1041000	You're not supposed to rap about that.
1041000	1043000	We found your tempo and also...
1043000	1045000	Found your audience.
1045000	1047000	Who are you guys?
1047000	1050000	Did all the colleges get off for Christmas?
1050000	1052000	Like all the sudden...
1052000	1056000	Fucking, this is amazing. You felt her poop when you fucked her?
1056000	1058000	Where have you guys been?
1058000	1061000	Dan, they've been at college and they miss their mothers.
1061000	1063000	You brought them back home.
1063000	1065000	Sick of hearing about Kierkegaard.
1065000	1067000	Feel someone's poop.
1067000	1071000	There's no place like home for the holidays.
1072000	1076000	So I guess the Hobbit's gonna be three movies.
1080000	1083000	Someone said okay. Who said okay? You're into it.
1083000	1085000	All right. Can you come up?
1085000	1088000	I can take like 9 hours, 12 hours. I'm cool with anything.
1088000	1090000	Will you come up and talk about it?
1090000	1093000	I don't know. I don't know what they're gonna do with it.
1093000	1094000	It's one book.
1094000	1096000	He asked you, would you get up on stage?
1096000	1099000	Because the audience isn't mics for the podcast.
1099000	1103000	We don't bully people here.
1104000	1106000	We don't make fun of people for coming up.
1106000	1109000	I just like to hear people and meet people.
1109000	1110000	Have you been here before?
1110000	1111000	Last week.
1111000	1112000	Oh, okay.
1112000	1113000	Does this work?
1113000	1114000	Yeah.
1114000	1115000	Yeah.
1115000	1118000	I know I'm not that tall.
1118000	1119000	Yeah, you are.
1119000	1121000	I'm as tall as you.
1121000	1123000	Are you like a hyterexic?
1123000	1124000	You are exactly that tall.
1124000	1126000	It's pointed at your mouth.
1126000	1128000	Wait, Dan, Dan.
1128000	1131000	I used to work at a rehab center,
1131000	1136000	and in the eating disorder unit, they told me this.
1136000	1140000	For anorexic women, they had this therapy technique
1140000	1144000	where they would have them draw how big they thought their body was
1144000	1147000	and then lay them down in it and take a picture of it.
1147000	1149000	I'm like, what is this, Sesame Street?
1149000	1151000	Is that how anorexia works? Really?
1151000	1154000	You can actually just think that your physical body is...
1154000	1156000	Anyways, I don't know.
1156000	1158000	Who's the hero and who's the villain?
1158000	1159000	What's your name?
1159000	1161000	Oh, I'm Phil.
1161000	1163000	That's okay.
1163000	1166000	You don't have to be Thor.
1166000	1168000	Phil, I'm going to have to do this,
1168000	1170000	because tonight is a no mic stand night.
1170000	1172000	You're going to have to Dan Cook this.
1172000	1174000	There you go. Put that mic stand away.
1174000	1175000	Oh, you just...
1175000	1177000	Yeah, I'm enforcing the no mic stand rule.
1177000	1178000	All right.
1178000	1180000	We're all...
1180000	1182000	There's not much to talk about with The Hobbit.
1182000	1185000	It's probably going to be nine hours
1185000	1188000	and it's probably going to be extended to 12 hours.
1188000	1190000	But okay, I read The Hobbit.
1190000	1192000	I did not so much read The Lord of the Rings trilogy,
1192000	1196000	but The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a trilogy in book form.
1196000	1198000	So they made a movie for each book.
1198000	1200000	The Hobbit was one book.
1200000	1204000	So if they make it where the Red Fern grows movie
1204000	1206000	and they make it three movies,
1206000	1207000	we get to go,
1207000	1211000	what is the first movie going to be about the Red Fern growing?
1211000	1213000	Are they never going to get to the Coonhounds dying?
1213000	1215000	I mean, they kind of stretch it.
1215000	1218000	Spoiler, sorry.
1218000	1222000	The Coonhounds die.
1222000	1225000	I mean, there's a lot to stretch with that movie.
1225000	1229000	There's a war that just happens to be only like 50 pages,
1229000	1231000	from what I remember.
1231000	1233000	Yeah, and they're making Anna Karenina one movie.
1233000	1235000	That book is long.
1236000	1238000	That's like a 900 page book, 1200 page book.
1238000	1239000	I read that thing.
1239000	1241000	You could make 18 movies out of that.
1241000	1243000	Oh, it's true.
1243000	1246000	Will you accept that you're up here in defense
1246000	1248000	of The Hobbit being three movies
1248000	1250000	in the face of a society that is crying out?
1250000	1256000	Why not merge these kill bills into one 90 minute thing?
1256000	1258000	Kill bill bills.
1258000	1261000	And you're saying the reason why...
1261000	1263000	That's what you'd be calling it.
1264000	1266000	I just found out five minutes ago,
1266000	1268000	and I'm already defending this.
1268000	1269000	I told you?
1269000	1270000	Yeah.
1270000	1272000	You found out from me that The Hobbit's three movies?
1272000	1273000	Yes.
1273000	1275000	I thought it was two movies.
1275000	1276000	Yo.
1276000	1277000	Yo.
1277000	1278000	Yo.
1278000	1280000	I'm Nicky Fink, yo.
1280000	1281000	Yo.
1281000	1282000	Yo.
1282000	1283000	Yo.
1283000	1286000	Deadline Hollywood news comes.
1286000	1289000	From me to your neighborhood,
1289000	1292000	I got to ear to the Hollywood ground.
1292000	1295000	I got some new scoops from The Hobbit I found.
1295000	1299000	I heard the Dateline L.A. is three movies.
1299000	1302000	Oh shit, some people think it's not groovy,
1302000	1306000	but motherfucker MC Phil's all right with it.
1306000	1309000	Now we're gonna fight with it.
1309000	1310000	Stupid.
1310000	1312000	But you could have told me it was four movies
1312000	1313000	and I would have been okay with it.
1313000	1315000	Okay, so your point being,
1315000	1317000	prolong the enjoyment.
1317000	1319000	Rather than have to sit...
1319000	1322000	They make 50,000 shitty movies a year
1322000	1324000	when Peter Jackson's behind the camera
1324000	1326000	and the content is...
1326000	1327000	Is he directing them?
1327000	1328000	Yes, I hope so.
1328000	1330000	Certainly not gonna ask you.
1330000	1332000	I know where you get your news.
1332000	1334000	Are you directing them at home?
1334000	1337000	You're saying as long as Peter Jackson's behind the camera
1337000	1339000	and they're in New Zealand
1339000	1344000	and they're dealing with that awesome original material,
1344000	1346000	you'll watch it forever.
1346000	1348000	You hope that every movie is eight hours long
1348000	1349000	and there's more a week.
1349000	1351000	I saw King Kong in theaters.
1351000	1353000	I may have thought that was a half hour long,
1353000	1356000	like maybe two and a half hours too long,
1356000	1357000	but I still saw it.
1357000	1358000	Right.
1358000	1359000	All right.
1359000	1361000	Well, all right.
1361000	1363000	I mean, it's hard to tell them to fuck off.
1363000	1365000	I've never read Tolkien,
1365000	1367000	but I really like the Lord of the Rings films
1367000	1371000	and I don't mind it being prolonged entertainment
1371000	1372000	if they're all good.
1372000	1375000	Well, certainly the appeal of the Tolkien-averse,
1375000	1376000	if I can call it that.
1376000	1377000	No, you may not, sir.
1378000	1380000	Let's ask Janet Tolkien.
1382000	1383000	Absolutely not.
1385000	1387000	Yeah, I heard she's the black sheep of the family.
1390000	1394000	I heard half of the Silmarillion went upper nose.
1397000	1398000	Half of the money.
1399000	1400000	Not this half.
1400000	1402000	That was a deep cut Tolkien reference.
1403000	1406000	All right.
1406000	1407000	Well, okay.
1407000	1412000	I mean, yeah, the appeal of the Tolkien-averse is the texture.
1412000	1416000	It's like the feel that you're there,
1416000	1417000	but I'm serious.
1417000	1418000	Like, let's see.
1418000	1419000	Have you read The Hobbit?
1419000	1420000	Yes.
1420000	1421000	How many times?
1421000	1424000	So let's break The Hobbit up into three parts.
1424000	1426000	Breaking The Hobbit up into three parts.
1426000	1428000	Where do you think the first movie is going to end?
1428000	1431000	Like probably when they reach the dragon, probably.
1431000	1432000	No.
1432000	1433000	No.
1433000	1434000	No.
1434000	1435000	Wait.
1435000	1437000	Dinner is when it will end at dinner.
1438000	1442000	And the second movie will begin with Jesus Christ, so many dishes.
1442000	1445000	I can't believe we ate all of that lasagna.
1445000	1447000	Well, we should think about fighting a dragon.
1447000	1451000	And so it came to pass that they thought about fighting a dragon.
1451000	1453000	Dan, this guy over here has a pretty good opinion
1453000	1455000	about where he thinks the first break.
1455000	1456000	Oh, Jesus, this guy?
1456000	1457000	Yeah.
1457000	1458000	All right.
1458000	1460000	You told me you were going to rape my soul last week.
1460000	1461000	Yeah, yeah.
1461000	1462000	We did a bit.
1462000	1463000	You were very good.
1463000	1464000	Thank you.
1464000	1465000	Remind us of your name, please.
1465000	1466000	Ben.
1466000	1467000	My name's Ben.
1467000	1468000	Ben.
1468000	1469000	Welcome back.
1469000	1470000	Ben.
1470000	1471000	Thank you.
1471000	1472000	Last week we kept pretending he was Greg Barrett
1472000	1474000	and that he was at the show.
1474000	1475000	All right.
1475000	1476000	Ben.
1476000	1479000	From my understanding of it, which is fairly limited as well,
1479000	1482000	it's that the third movie is actually going to be another book
1482000	1486000	that comes between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series.
1486000	1487000	No?
1487000	1488000	Am I wrong?
1488000	1489000	All right.
1489000	1490000	Get up here.
1490000	1491000	Get up here.
1491000	1492000	Come on.
1492000	1493000	No.
1493000	1494000	You stay.
1494000	1495000	You stay.
1495000	1498000	Because this is how the first Hobbit movie's going to be.
1498000	1501000	As far as I understand the book, it's just a bunch of fucking dwarves
1501000	1503000	like, you're like, drowning into a Hobbit.
1503000	1504000	Hey, I'm here.
1504000	1505000	What's going on?
1505000	1507000	That's going to be the whole movie.
1507000	1509000	We're halfway through the first movie.
1509000	1512000	Is the first movie just going to be a Tom Bombadil movie?
1512000	1513000	I don't know.
1513000	1514000	I don't know.
1514000	1515000	I get it.
1515000	1516000	I get it.
1517000	1519000	Tom Bombadil was cut out of the first Lord of the Rings
1519000	1522000	and a lot of fanboys got very upset when this character was cut out.
1522000	1523000	All right.
1523000	1526000	The original plan for The Hobbit movie was there was going to be
1526000	1528000	The Hobbit was going to be one movie
1528000	1530000	and then there was going to be a second movie
1530000	1533000	which was going to bridge The Hobbit with the Lord of the Rings,
1533000	1537000	which people got upset about because there's no literary reference
1537000	1539000	to bridge that.
1539000	1540000	Fight.
1540000	1541000	Fight.
1541000	1542000	I don't remember the name of it.
1542000	1543000	Fight.
1543000	1544000	Fight.
1544000	1546000	I don't remember the name of it, but there is a book that...
1546000	1547000	What's it called?
1547000	1549000	It's all the appendices.
1549000	1550000	Get up here.
1550000	1551000	Get on stage.
1551000	1552000	Get on stage.
1554000	1557000	Somebody Instagram this immediately.
1558000	1562000	This is Falcom and Malcolm and Tukin and Pukin.
1563000	1565000	Are you guys talking about The Lost Tales?
1565000	1566000	Is that what you're talking about?
1566000	1567000	No.
1567000	1571000	There was that compendium of that Christopher Tolkien found in...
1571000	1572000	I'll shut up.
1572000	1573000	That's Mormon.
1573000	1574000	All right.
1574000	1575000	Unrelated.
1576000	1577000	Again, my...
1577000	1578000	All right.
1578000	1581000	My knowledge is as limited as these gentlemen, but there's a bunch of...
1581000	1584000	Everyone keeps saying that, but...
1584000	1585000	Jerry.
1585000	1586000	Jerry.
1587000	1588000	Get up here.
1588000	1589000	Get on stage.
1589000	1590000	All right.
1592000	1594000	We're going to need a bigger stage.
1596000	1597000	Okay.
1597000	1599000	They're breaking The Hobbit into three movies.
1599000	1600000	The first...
1600000	1601000	Wait a second.
1601000	1602000	This guy shouldn't know.
1602000	1603000	What?
1603000	1604000	No.
1604000	1605000	Okay.
1605000	1608000	The first movie is the travel to Smog the dragon.
1608000	1610000	And then the second movie is all about fighting the dragon.
1610000	1614000	And then the third movie is about Dale and the Battle of the Five Armies.
1614000	1619000	And they're taking additional information from the Cimarillion to fill in when Gandalf left
1619000	1621000	for 90 pages and then came back.
1621000	1625000	And they're just making it up based off of 20 minutes or 20 pages of him being like,
1625000	1626000	Oh, I fought Sauron.
1626000	1627000	Blah, blah, blah.
1627000	1628000	That might be kind of cool.
1628000	1629000	Yeah.
1630000	1631000	You say fought or fought?
1631000	1632000	Fights Sauron.
1632000	1637000	When he fights Sauron, the wizard or whatever, they fill that in and they're going to show
1637000	1638000	it instead.
1638000	1641000	So they get all the way to the precipice of fighting Smog.
1641000	1642000	But they don't actually do it.
1642000	1643000	Right.
1643000	1648000	But you know, the first Lord of the Rings movie, they didn't get a lot done, but it was very
1648000	1649000	exciting.
1649000	1650000	Yeah.
1650000	1651000	It's mostly walking.
1651000	1652000	Yeah.
1652000	1654000	So then they fight Smog the whole second movie, which would be pretty badass.
1654000	1655000	I guess.
1655000	1656000	I've actually never read the book, so...
1656000	1657000	That guarantees you Empire Strikes Back.
1658000	1659000	He's never read it.
1660000	1661000	That's all right.
1661000	1662000	He doesn't have to...
1662000	1667000	If this was about literature, this wouldn't be a billion dollar industry.
1668000	1671000	How much have you guys read today?
1672000	1673000	But all right.
1673000	1674000	So...
1675000	1679000	What's your name, hero, from the middle audience?
1680000	1681000	My name is Tyler.
1681000	1682000	Tyler.
1682000	1685000	So you've never read the books, but you know more than these guys who have clearly read
1685000	1686000	these books.
1686000	1688000	Well, I saw that like 1988 cartoon.
1688000	1689000	Yeah.
1689000	1692000	That has The Hobbit back then.
1693000	1694000	Was that...
1694000	1696000	Did Ralph Bakshi direct that?
1696000	1697000	Yes.
1698000	1700000	See, that's all I know about talking.
1700000	1703000	You guys get so mad when you agree with things.
1704000	1707000	I grew up on that stuff, like seeing it and not knowing it from...
1707000	1709000	I was just like being disturbed by it.
1709000	1711000	Like that and Watership Down.
1712000	1714000	I'm afraid to watch it again in adulthood.
1714000	1715000	All right.
1716000	1722000	It's cool that you wore a newsy cap because you really brought extra and made us know
1722000	1724000	all about it.
1725000	1726000	There are fanboys that are here.
1726000	1728000	I just had to come represent, I guess.
1728000	1729000	All right.
1729000	1735000	Well, I guess let's have a hand for the fellowship of looking forward to The Hobbit.
1740000	1743000	Next week is going to be Jane Austen, ladies.
1744000	1747000	Yeah, sharpen your corrections.
1754000	1755000	That was exciting.
1755000	1758000	It gets exciting fast here.
1758000	1760000	You never know what's going to happen.
1760000	1761000	Oh my God.
1761000	1762000	I can't believe this does.
1762000	1765000	There are guys shaking each other's hands.
1768000	1772000	The newsy guy went and sat down and then the guy in front of him turned around and was
1772000	1776000	like, thank you for whatever you did.
1776000	1778000	You represent something up there.
1778000	1780000	I don't know what you said.
1781000	1783000	They might work together.
1783000	1787000	But I want to think that he was like, thank you so much for what you said.
1787000	1789000	It was so brave.
1790000	1792000	It reminds me of my jury duty story.
1792000	1795000	Did I ever tell my jury duty story up here when I was at the end of the walk?
1795000	1798000	If you did it way before podcast time and probably before...
1798000	1799000	I'm going to breeze through it really fast.
1799000	1802000	I tell the story as much as you do, probably.
1802000	1804000	It was the greatest, greatest day of my life.
1804000	1808000	It was the only day when I was as much a hero as the hobbitses and the bobbitses.
1808000	1809000	Will you do me a favor?
1809000	1813000	Will you take this five minute story and break it up over three podcasts?
1814000	1817000	Get us into your car and drive into jury duty.
1817000	1822000	The first one takes you to me showing up at the courthouse and then I insert a whole scene
1822000	1827000	where, you know, yeah, Sean Astin says, think about it this way.
1829000	1830000	You're right.
1830000	1832000	This is a good ending.
1836000	1837000	I went to jury duty.
1837000	1839000	The year is 1972.
1839000	1840000	Close.
1840000	1841000	It was like 90-something.
1841000	1842000	I was still in Milwaukee.
1842000	1848000	It was a very young, spry little child, little writer and improviser living in Milwaukee.
1848000	1849000	And I went to jury duty.
1849000	1851000	Never gone to jury duty before.
1851000	1855000	And you spend the whole time, you get quickly indoctrinated into the culture of,
1855000	1856000	I got to get out of here.
1856000	1858000	Like, we're the suckers.
1858000	1859000	We got to get out of here.
1859000	1861000	Like, are the people explaining it to you?
1861000	1864000	No one's going like, congratulations on jury duty.
1864000	1867000	Like, they know that they need to ingratiate themselves to you by saying,
1867000	1869000	sorry, you're at jury duty.
1869000	1871000	And they're right to do that.
1871000	1875000	It's a drag if you're over 12.
1875000	1880000	It might be exciting for someone who still thinks pencils might be spaceships.
1880000	1882000	You could maybe occupy yourself.
1882000	1884000	Everyone else wants to kill themselves.
1884000	1891000	So you spend the whole time getting called and not called.
1891000	1895000	And you're told, oh, you're on the precipice of getting dismissed.
1895000	1900000	And then we were so close to, me and my group, we were so close to getting out.
1900000	1902000	And then we got called for this case.
1902000	1904000	And we're like, fuck you.
1904000	1908000	At that point, you go through phases where you go, I kind of actually,
1908000	1911000	I don't want to seem uncool to my peers here.
1911000	1915000	But I actually kind of think it would be cool if I got called in and someone
1915000	1918000	murdered someone and I had to decide who murdered someone.
1918000	1919000	You have these thoughts in your head.
1919000	1920000	Like, I'm going to be a juror.
1920000	1921000	It's going to be amazing.
1921000	1923000	But then that quickly fades.
1923000	1925000	And you go, I got to get out of here.
1925000	1926000	Please let me.
1926000	1927000	I'm so close.
1927000	1928000	And then they call you.
1928000	1929000	And you have to go.
1929000	1931000	And you shuffle into the courtroom.
1931000	1933000	And we end up in the jury box.
1933000	1934000	And it's all kind of random.
1934000	1937000	And I ended up the juror number one.
1937000	1938000	I was sitting in the front.
1938000	1941000	It's kind of randomly arranged.
1941000	1944000	And there's this kid sitting there.
1944000	1946000	Looked like he was like 16 years old.
1946000	1948000	No idea how old he was.
1948000	1949000	The defendant?
1949000	1950000	Yes.
1950000	1951000	The defendant.
1951000	1952000	Yeah, OK.
1952000	1953000	I checked that one.
1953000	1954000	The judge.
1954000	1955000	Sorry.
1955000	1959000	No, we'll edit out whatever bored you.
1959000	1963000	I just, yeah.
1963000	1965000	Slow rap.
1965000	1966000	Slow story.
1966000	1967000	Sorry.
1967000	1968000	I know.
1968000	1969000	It's not a slow story.
1969000	1970000	I just was.
1970000	1971000	Go ahead.
1971000	1976000	Turns out the kid was like a pot possession thing.
1976000	1979000	This kid lived in the outskirts of Wisconsin.
1979000	1982000	And he was walking down a highway.
1982000	1984000	They give you all the details of the case.
1984000	1988000	And he was walking down a county highway
1988000	1995000	in his little rural area of the free fire zone,
1995000	1998000	Sector 7, where there's probably nothing
1998000	2000000	to do but smoke pot.
2000000	2003000	And a cop started coming, probably the only cop
2003000	2004000	where he lives.
2004000	2007000	And the kid had a pipe.
2007000	2009000	And it had a little bit of resin in it.
2009000	2013000	And he chucked his pipe into a bunch of corn.
2013000	2015000	He was just like, oh, fuck.
2015000	2016000	There's a cop coming.
2016000	2017000	It kind of went like this.
2017000	2021000	Cop stopped and got out and went through the corn
2021000	2024000	and found the pipe and took the kid in.
2024000	2027000	And at some point, the kid apparently,
2027000	2029000	this is why he's my hero, must have exercised
2029000	2032000	his right to trial by jury for this thing.
2032000	2037000	Because here I am now and these other people.
2037000	2040000	And so they explain the details of the case.
2040000	2041000	And then they go.
2041000	2043000	They say the thing that's like, I'm sure most of you
2043000	2044000	have been on jury duty.
2044000	2047000	There's like that moment where they go,
2047000	2051000	does anyone feel like they wouldn't be able to be
2051000	2052000	impartial in this case?
2052000	2056000	And then you see the Jehovah's Witness lady raise her hand.
2056000	2058000	And you watch her get to walk the fuck out.
2058000	2060000	And you're like, well, it's Jehovah Witness.
2060000	2062000	Like you're trying.
2062000	2064000	And then the person was a victim of a.
2064000	2067000	Because they have a witness in the name.
2067000	2068000	It used to be.
2068000	2070000	This has changed now, by the way, because I just recently
2070000	2071000	did jury duty in LA.
2071000	2073000	And they were like, fuck you.
2073000	2074000	Fuck all of that.
2074000	2076000	There's a portcullis comes down.
2076000	2079000	And they're like, nice try, asshole.
2079000	2081000	But back then it was like, someone went, I'm a Jehovah's
2081000	2082000	Witness.
2082000	2083000	Get the fuck out.
2083000	2084000	I can't sit in judgment of others.
2084000	2086000	And then someone else, I was a victim of a violent crime.
2086000	2087000	Fuck you.
2087000	2088000	My friend's a cop.
2088000	2089000	Go fuck yourself.
2089000	2090000	Get out.
2090000	2091000	Go home.
2091000	2092000	Go play Nintendo.
2092000	2093000	And you're like, well.
2093000	2096000	And so this one was like handed to me on a silver platter.
2096000	2100000	Because the truth is like, of course I'm not going to judge
2100000	2101000	this impartially.
2101000	2102000	Like leave the kid alone.
2102000	2105000	It's like he might end up being a senator if you don't bust him
2105000	2109000	now for a fucking dumbass pipe full of a stupid thing that
2109000	2110000	goes out of the ground.
2110000	2112000	It's like, a rest of the cop.
2112000	2113000	Throw him off a cliff.
2113000	2117000	I'm sure neither choice will measurably improve society.
2117000	2124000	But there's a better chance that if the cop exploded, I'm not
2124000	2125000	impartial.
2125000	2126000	That's my point.
2126000	2127000	I'm partial.
2127000	2128000	I have a feeling.
2128000	2130000	And a cop killer.
2130000	2131000	I don't mean that.
2131000	2133000	I just mean that they exploded.
2134000	2141000	If you're a police officer, I don't drive a silver Prius.
2141000	2142000	I don't really.
2142000	2145000	There's a lot of great people who are cops and whatever.
2145000	2148000	And you would like to see them explode apparently.
2148000	2152000	I meant biologically, like sci-fi wise.
2152000	2157000	I didn't mean like Al Qaeda.
2157000	2158000	See what society's become.
2158000	2162000	This story takes place in a different universe before a lot of
2162000	2163000	things went down.
2165000	2167000	The judge goes, does anyone think that they wouldn't be
2167000	2169000	able to be impartial about this?
2169000	2171000	My hand shot up like a rocket.
2171000	2174000	Because I was like, holy shit, I actually can't be impartial.
2174000	2176000	I'm going to get out of jury duty.
2176000	2177000	I raised it.
2177000	2179000	And everyone kind of chuckled.
2179000	2181000	This young man's hand sure went up fast.
2184000	2187000	And I was juror number one, which made me the jury foreman
2187000	2189000	should it actually go to the thing.
2189000	2192000	And then they were like, OK, sir, what's your problem?
2192000	2196000	And I said, well, I don't think that this law should be a law.
2196000	2198000	So I think that any kind of legal proceeding about it the
2198000	2200000	whole time, I'm going to be thinking like, well,
2200000	2202000	let's just get out of here.
2202000	2205000	That makes me like I'm not going to be able to be impartial
2205000	2210000	because I don't see the crime here.
2210000	2213000	And they're like, well, no, but it is a crime.
2213000	2215000	We didn't ask you if you think it should be a crime.
2215000	2218000	We asked you if you think you could judge him.
2218000	2220000	They started really, really laying into me.
2220000	2223000	And I was like, well, yeah, but I'm telling you,
2223000	2224000	the customer is always right.
2224000	2229000	You asked the question, do you think that I would be able to
2229000	2230000	judge it impartially?
2230000	2235000	Like, who are you going to believe over me when I say no?
2235000	2239000	And what better answer than because I think this is a plant
2239000	2241000	that grows out of the ground and I don't think he was
2241000	2242000	hurting anybody.
2242000	2245000	And I think that it's your business.
2245000	2248000	The larger society wants to have a big war on some kind of
2248000	2249000	controlled substance.
2249000	2251000	And I can't step into that because that's a big mess.
2251000	2255000	But I see a kid and I see a dumb pipe and I see a lot of wasted
2255000	2257000	time and I want to get out of here.
2257000	2259000	And I think it's like, you know, I just kind of answered
2259000	2260000	honestly.
2260000	2265000	But then the prosecutor got up and was like, no,
2265000	2267000	I want to ask him a question.
2267000	2269000	But don't you understand that it's illegal?
2269000	2270000	Yes, but I don't think it should be.
2270000	2271000	I don't think it should be.
2271000	2273000	I don't know how many times to say this.
2273000	2276000	And so we went back and forth for like 10 minutes.
2276000	2277000	It was crazy.
2277000	2279000	And I'm not exaggerating.
2279000	2285000	I hope you can trust me by now to know that I wouldn't exaggerate.
2285000	2288000	I told you to shove the Sharpie pen up my ass.
2288000	2292000	If this story involved me being less than amazing,
2292000	2293000	I would tell you.
2293000	2296000	The weird thing is I was awesome in this story.
2296000	2298000	It was an accident.
2298000	2299000	They made me awesome.
2299000	2301000	I just went back and forth with them.
2301000	2304000	And so then they're like, oh, fine, whatever.
2304000	2307000	And then because I was juror number one
2307000	2313000	and everyone watched that happen, then they go, OK, let's move on.
2313000	2317000	Does anyone else feel that they would not be able to be impartial?
2317000	2322000	And eight hands went up, including, and I'm not kidding,
2322000	2327000	it was like a fucking rom-com, like an old, old woman,
2327000	2330000	really old, like brought knitting to jury duty,
2330000	2333000	like not ironically Winota Ryder, woo, knitting,
2333000	2338000	but like knitting her clothes for things, like for her cat,
2338000	2341000	like raised her hand, like everybody.
2341000	2345000	And they went down a lot like, OK, now what about you?
2345000	2348000	Well, I think it's, you know, I guess like the young man said,
2348000	2350000	like, and then everybody, they went down a lot.
2350000	2353000	I was like, well, I guess it's like he said.
2353000	2358000	And the judge was like this, he's like clapping his hand.
2358000	2360000	Because humanity is a resource.
2360000	2362000	It's like Soylent Green in the courthouse.
2362000	2367000	They need to flood these channels with human fucking bodies.
2367000	2373000	And you can revolt and go, no, you need us to technically make the courthouses work.
2373000	2374000	We don't want to be here.
2374000	2376000	We want to poop on you.
2376000	2379000	In the Constitution, they tell you when you go to jury duty
2379000	2381000	that you're only there to judge the evidence.
2381000	2383000	But in the Constitution, it actually says no.
2383000	2385000	You're also there to judge the validity of the law itself.
2385000	2389000	Yeah, you're there because you are the law. You're Judge Dred.
2389000	2391000	You are allowed to say, what if I don't like the law?
2391000	2392000	They go, that's not what we're doing.
2392000	2394000	They go, well, the Constitution says otherwise.
2394000	2398000	And if you say, by the way, if you want to get out of jury duty,
2398000	2401000	stand up and go, what's the court's stance on jury veto?
2401000	2404000	They go, see you later.
2404000	2408000	They will validate your parking and give you a fucking bean burrito.
2408000	2411000	It was late in the day, and everyone's going,
2411000	2415000	oh, I think what the young man said, I was like, he wasn't hurting anyone.
2415000	2419000	And the judge went, guys, and the two lawyers came up,
2419000	2422000	and they went, how's your man coming?
2422000	2426000	And they all walked away. They all left.
2426000	2431000	And then they went to the kid who was sitting there.
2431000	2436000	Now, nobody but the jury, the jury just sitting there.
2436000	2439000	Are you smoking a big cigar at this point?
2439000	2442000	Not quite. Well, yeah, I guess in my head I am.
2442000	2445000	But this is the thing that reminded me of that moment
2445000	2447000	when the guy turned and congratulated me.
2447000	2449000	Because the old woman who was sitting in front of me,
2449000	2454000	she turned in her chair, and she put her ginger paper,
2454000	2459000	wonderful Hallmark hand on my thigh, and said,
2459000	2465000	I just want to tell you, I think what you did was very brave.
2466000	2472000	I love getting high, and I want to get out of jury duty.
2472000	2478000	And I'm also brave, amazing, jackpot.
2478000	2481000	And everyone was like, yeah, yeah, I was afraid to say something
2481000	2483000	because I was, you know, it's like, it's a courthouse.
2483000	2485000	Then they're going to come to your house.
2485000	2488000	You guys comfortable living in that society?
2488000	2490000	You really think that if you were in jury duty and said,
2490000	2492000	well, I've got a problem with this, that you'd go home,
2492000	2495000	and there'd be a cop going, well, smarty pants,
2495000	2498000	sounds like you like the reefer.
2498000	2501000	But now we got your name and number.
2501000	2503000	We'll shut you down, Harmon.
2503000	2506000	Stay away from the pool hall.
2506000	2510000	Make that happen sooner than later if you think that's possible.
2510000	2513000	But now that's what's closer to the world we live in now,
2513000	2514000	for certain.
2514000	2515000	Probably, yeah.
2515000	2517000	Well, because you sure can't get out of jury duty anymore.
2518000	2523000	So the judge comes back with the lawyers.
2523000	2529000	Everybody, the kid is going, get a big giant smile on his face.
2529000	2536000	And the judge says, so what happened is, it's late in the day,
2536000	2543000	and we just sort of settled the matter in chambers.
2543000	2545000	And so there's no more case.
2545000	2549000	And you guys are free to go, but I would like to talk to you
2549000	2552000	in the hallway, the judge said, to you, the jurors.
2552000	2553000	Yeah.
2553000	2555000	Well, could you please meet me around front?
2555000	2557000	I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
2557000	2558000	So you're all free to go.
2558000	2560000	And we all get up out of the jury box
2560000	2563000	and we all walk over to the doorway where the judge,
2563000	2570000	in his little robe, big robe, sorry, society, and his crown,
2570000	2572000	came over, and he's like, you guys are free to go.
2572000	2574000	I just want to let you know, you know,
2574000	2577000	I don't approve of what you did in there,
2577000	2580000	but I approve of the system that let you do it.
2585000	2587000	I think it's amazing that you're able to do it,
2587000	2589000	and that's, you know, a lot of people don't understand
2589000	2591000	that's what the justice system is based on,
2591000	2593000	is your ability to do what you did.
2593000	2596000	And I don't, you know, I think something bad happened in there,
2596000	2599000	technically, but that's my own personal point of view.
2599000	2603000	As a legal person, I admire what happened in there.
2603000	2605000	I mean, I don't, but I do.
2605000	2607000	And it was like, shut up.
2607000	2612000	I mean, he was basically saying, as far as I could understand.
2612000	2613000	I never want to be illegal,
2613000	2616000	but you guys are legally allowed to override it.
2616000	2617000	Yeah, exactly.
2617000	2620000	Like, why don't you take that 15-year-old kid
2620000	2623000	and ruin his life for smoking weed?
2623000	2627000	Because Thomas Jefferson said you could fuck off.
2627000	2630000	Like, he was mad,
2630000	2633000	but also didn't want to make his forefathers mad.
2633000	2634000	Like, so weird.
2634000	2636000	Well, he was a guy that actually read the Constitution.
2636000	2638000	And when you go to the, I went to jury duty.
2638000	2639000	I've been there a couple times,
2639000	2642000	and the first time I was there, I was like, I don't know,
2642000	2644000	I was in college, so I'm maybe 18 years old.
2644000	2646000	And I was sitting there,
2646000	2648000	and at the LA courthouse down there,
2648000	2651000	I don't know if you guys have been there, but it's a bummer.
2651000	2654000	And I was sitting there, and there was this bunch of people
2654000	2655000	just sitting there.
2655000	2656000	Some people are really happy about it.
2656000	2657000	They got their juror badges on,
2657000	2659000	and they're really excited about it.
2659000	2660000	This is my civic duty.
2660000	2661000	I get to be involved.
2661000	2663000	Like, that's totally fine.
2663000	2665000	If you want to be there, that's a good juror, probably.
2665000	2668000	Someone that wants to be there says, I really am interested.
2668000	2671000	I would like to check this out, and I hope I get a good case.
2671000	2672000	A lot of people are like, I got a kid.
2672000	2673000	I got a babysit later on.
2673000	2674000	I got to go to school.
2674000	2676000	And, like, how do I get out of this thing?
2676000	2679000	Well, there was a silent radio going by at the speed of sound.
2679000	2682000	Like, a little red, you know, digital thing going by.
2682000	2685000	And it was all in mumbo-jumbo legalese, saying, like,
2685000	2687000	in the event that you,
2687000	2690000	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
2690000	2691000	and stuff like that.
2691000	2693000	And I read it once, and I waited for it to cycle through again.
2693000	2696000	It's also where the snack bar is and where the restrooms are.
2696000	2698000	And I grabbed this woman next to me,
2698000	2700000	this, like, you know, housewifey lady next to me.
2700000	2702000	I'm like, read this with me.
2702000	2704000	And tell me if you think this is what it's saying.
2704000	2706000	And what it said is, if you don't feel like you should be here,
2706000	2708000	you can walk up Hill Street.
2708000	2711000	And if you have the blues by being here right now,
2711000	2713000	you can walk up Hill Street.
2713000	2715000	And you go to the fourth floor of a thing,
2715000	2717000	and you can say, and you can fill out a form.
2717000	2719000	And I read it three or four times,
2719000	2721000	and I just got up and walked out.
2721000	2724000	And, like, some guy's like, whoa.
2724000	2726000	Where you going, man?
2726000	2728000	I'm like, read that thing.
2728000	2731000	He's like, I've been trying to read that thing for half hour.
2731000	2732000	I'm like, me too.
2732000	2733000	I was like...
2733000	2736000	It's like, I pictured as, like, green Matrix characters.
2736000	2740000	You can read that? Yeah.
2740000	2742000	But, yeah, but, like, the salad ready, like,
2742000	2744000	it goes by and says pizza.
2744000	2746000	Our number is, like, it goes by too fast.
2746000	2748000	Like, no one's going to get your delivery number
2748000	2750000	on the silent radio out in front of Hard Times Pizza.
2750000	2752000	It goes by too fast.
2752000	2754000	And so I got in the elevator,
2754000	2756000	and then there was really, like, a hand stop
2756000	2758000	the elevator from closing, and there were, like,
2758000	2761000	seven people that were like, we're coming with you.
2761000	2763000	And then, like, other people saw that.
2763000	2765000	We all got in, and there was people getting out,
2765000	2767000	and they were coming toward us.
2767000	2769000	So we walk up a block across, like, Hill
2769000	2771000	and whatever that is, Hope or something like that,
2771000	2773000	and we walk up the street, and then we go in a thing
2773000	2775000	and we go in the elevator, and we look behind us,
2775000	2777000	and there's 15, 20 other people coming.
2777000	2779000	And they're like, what's that?
2779000	2781000	And we're going, where are you going?
2781000	2783000	Where are you going?
2783000	2785000	And I was so, I didn't want to be there.
2785000	2787000	Oh, I didn't want to get out of there.
2787000	2789000	And so we go up to the fourth floor of the place,
2789000	2793000	and an elevator door opens, and a bunch of, like, women,
2793000	2795000	mostly that worked there in the little cubicles,
2795000	2798000	saw the elevator open, and they saw 20 people come out.
2798000	2801000	And they was like, oh, God.
2802000	2804000	Once a month, somebody reads that fucker.
2806000	2808000	Another Pied Piper.
2809000	2810000	So they give you a form that says,
2810000	2811000	why don't you want to be here?
2811000	2814000	And you can say this, you can say that.
2814000	2817000	And so there's, like, two lines, if it's not one of the four
2817000	2820000	things they give you as reasons, you can say why.
2820000	2823000	And I was like, I don't believe the way the criminal justice,
2823000	2825000	like, operate, system operates.
2825000	2828000	I went in this big, like, you know, Emma Goldman thing,
2828000	2830000	like, the system's on trial.
2830000	2834000	And I was like, I wrote on the back of it and filled it up.
2834000	2837000	And I go, OK, this guy's going to be a bad juror.
2837000	2839000	So I get there, and they read through your stuff.
2839000	2841000	And this woman, she was this black lady,
2841000	2843000	she had, like, you know, crosses,
2843000	2846000	a very Christian black lady, very nice
2846000	2848000	and very tired of her job.
2848000	2851000	And I sit there, she goes, all right, Jeff.
2851000	2852000	And she's looking at it.
2852000	2853000	She's reading.
2853000	2855000	She's like, she's reading the front.
2856000	2858000	And she turns over to the other side,
2858000	2861000	and she sees the other side, just dents writing,
2861000	2862000	like, Chaucer on the back.
2862000	2865000	And then she's like, and she reads.
2865000	2866000	She gets, like, halfway through.
2866000	2869000	And she goes, Jeff, I can't give them this.
2869000	2870000	They're going to make you be a juror.
2870000	2872000	Just go in there, tell them you don't want to be there.
2872000	2874000	They'll probably let you out of it.
2874000	2876000	I don't want to spend the rest of my week,
2876000	2878000	like, going through juror selection
2878000	2880000	and doing, like, I don't want to be here.
2880000	2882000	And they're like, I can't say that.
2882000	2884000	And I go, what can I say?
2884000	2887000	What can I write on this piece of paper that gets me out of it?
2887000	2891000	And she goes, and she stands up a little bit
2891000	2893000	and looks over at me.
2895000	2898000	Because she's so sick of me and the job.
2898000	2899000	And she looks back down.
2899000	2901000	Like, she makes sure no one's listening.
2901000	2905000	She goes, say religious.
2905000	2906000	I'm like, religious.
2906000	2912000	She goes, right, religious on the carding line.
2912000	2915000	I thought, religious.
2915000	2917000	Jeff Davis.
2917000	2918000	She goes, sign it.
2918000	2920000	And so I had John Hancocked it.
2920000	2922000	And she goes, you're free to go.
2922000	2924000	I'm like, tell everybody that.
2924000	2926000	And she's like, if we told everybody that,
2926000	2928000	there wouldn't be any juries anymore.
2928000	2929000	Now you can't.
2929000	2931000	So I got another sentence 10 years later.
2931000	2934000	I thought I was off to the books forever.
2934000	2937000	I thought that was, you know, like, I was done with that.
2937000	2939000	No, they changed the system.
2939000	2940000	I got the jury thing again.
2940000	2942000	And I wrote religious this and that.
2942000	2944000	And then you got another thing back that said,
2944000	2946000	get your ass in here, boy.
2946000	2947000	It's a nice try.
2947000	2948000	You'll go to jail.
2948000	2951000	So I went online and I read about Jura Vito.
2951000	2953000	And I was prepared for that one.
2953000	2956000	But fortunately, I actually had a thing.
2956000	2958000	I went in this last time.
2958000	2960000	By the way, I would do jury duty now.
2960000	2961000	I'm not that busy anymore.
2961000	2962000	I would do it.
2962000	2963000	I'd be interested.
2963000	2964000	That's how I felt.
2964000	2966000	It's the same way I feel about software piracy.
2966000	2968000	Like, I stole my ass a lot of Adobe shit.
2968000	2972000	So if I need Photoshop, I made enough money off of using
2972000	2974000	Photoshop for free.
2974000	2976000	And if I have it, they get it.
2976000	2979000	And it all worked out for all of us in the end.
2979000	2986000	When that $5 a day wasn't going to cover my rent,
2986000	2987000	I was like, fuck jury duty.
2987000	2989000	But now I'm like, OK, I'll go in.
2989000	2990000	I'll do my duty.
2990000	2991000	It's a duty.
2991000	2993000	If nobody did it, what the fuck are you going to do?
2993000	2997000	What about that kid who got caught smoking pop by a dick cop?
2997000	2998000	There's a kid out there.
2998000	2999000	You could make a difference.
2999000	3001000	So I went into the LA Superior Court,
3001000	3004000	and I went through two days of this business.
3004000	3009000	And it was just funny because I went through all this thing.
3009000	3011000	And my heart was pumping.
3011000	3013000	I'm like, am I going to try to get out of it?
3013000	3016000	Am I going to try to say I won't be impartial?
3016000	3018000	But I watched them pick off one by one.
3018000	3020000	And by pick off, I mean not pick off.
3020000	3022000	Like, people tried to get out of jury duty.
3022000	3027000	It just said, no, it's so religious.
3027000	3028000	And they're like, fuck you.
3028000	3029000	Sit down.
3029000	3031000	Welcome to the jury.
3031000	3033000	And how about you, ma'am?
3033000	3037000	But it got disturbing because there was a woman who stood up
3037000	3043000	and said, like, I'm a writer and sometime an actor.
3043000	3044000	I've even dabbled in directing.
3044000	3046000	I think I can tell a lady faking,
3046000	3048000	being the victim of a violent crime
3048000	3051000	and not wanting to be a part of this
3051000	3053000	and being emotionally traumatized by it.
3053000	3058000	And she was either Meryl Streep or was out.
3058000	3062000	I watched a woman get abused a second time by the system
3062000	3064000	because she was like, I just can't.
3064000	3066000	And she was fucked up about it because they tell you
3066000	3068000	the details of the crime.
3068000	3070000	They go, this guy stabbed this guy and then this thing happened
3070000	3071000	and this and this.
3071000	3072000	And she's like, I can't do this.
3072000	3074000	I've been through this before.
3074000	3076000	This is not when she's already been on the panel
3076000	3078000	when they're saying they're really like she's on the panel.
3078000	3080000	Oh, so this is real juris selection.
3081000	3083000	And it was, OK, good.
3083000	3084000	Sit back down.
3084000	3086000	And it was like nobody got let go.
3086000	3088000	They did not do any of that business.
3088000	3090000	And I was in the elevator with her.
3090000	3091000	And I turned to her.
3091000	3094000	It was such an awkward moment because I turned to her
3094000	3097000	and I said, I can't believe they didn't let you go.
3097000	3101000	And she responded to me like really emotionally.
3101000	3104000	So I wasn't trying to get let go.
3104000	3106000	I was just being honest.
3106000	3109000	She thought that I was saying, yeah, jury duty, right?
3109000	3110000	Fuck this shit.
3110000	3112000	I can't believe they didn't buy that.
3112000	3113000	You know what I mean?
3113000	3115000	Like I felt like I was part of the.
3115000	3118000	I was like, no, I just meant like I can't believe the government
3118000	3121000	is terrible and raped you in there.
3121000	3123000	But it felt like I was.
3123000	3124000	Oh, God, it was the worst.
3124000	3125000	But at the end of it.
3125000	3127000	So I'm like, OK, I'm doing jury duty
3127000	3129000	because I just watched this lady get trounced.
3129000	3131000	Like I'm not going to go up there and go, nanu, nanu,
3131000	3132000	I'm racist.
3137000	3138000	I'm not doing it.
3140000	3142000	Just so I can tweet it.
3142000	3144000	Because that lady is going to be haunting me
3144000	3145000	for the rest of my life.
3145000	3148000	That jury duty is duty.
3148000	3151000	That better be the name of this podcast.
3152000	3154000	Nanu, nanu, I'm racist.
3156000	3159000	So I hunker down for the due diligence
3159000	3162000	and we end the whole day and then I go home.
3162000	3163000	I'm busy as fuck.
3163000	3164000	I'm like, I got to go back.
3164000	3166000	It's a bummer to have to go downtown.
3166000	3168000	It's blah, blah, blah, you know, first world problems.
3168000	3170000	But I go back and I'm there.
3170000	3173000	And we show up and we're waiting outside the courtroom
3173000	3175000	and we wait and we wait and we wait.
3175000	3177000	And then a guy comes out at a certain point and goes like,
3177000	3183000	there's been a development and you can go to lunch.
3183000	3184000	So I went to lunch.
3184000	3186000	This was the day that the space shuttle
3186000	3188000	was being flown all around LA.
3188000	3190000	I don't know if this is an important part of the story,
3190000	3193000	but it was an odd experience for me because I had no idea.
3193000	3194000	I was on jury duty.
3194000	3196000	It was just like, I got to get a drink.
3196000	3197000	It's 11 a.m.
3197000	3200000	And I'd never hang out downtown.
3200000	3202000	So I'm just like walking.
3202000	3205000	You walk down Ferris Street and you have a margarita.
3205000	3208000	I looked on my phone for martini icons
3208000	3210000	and was like following it.
3210000	3212000	And as I'm walking across this park,
3212000	3215000	there's like this industrial park downtown.
3215000	3217000	It was like a zombie movie.
3217000	3222000	Like everyone was like looking at a fixed point in the sky.
3222000	3224000	And I kept like nine times,
3224000	3227000	I kept looking for like a suicide jumper.
3227000	3228000	And there was never anything.
3228000	3229000	I just kept walking.
3229000	3231000	I was like, maybe this is what happens to people
3231000	3232000	when they work downtown.
3232000	3234000	Like maybe they're like cattle.
3234000	3236000	Maybe they're just grazing freedom.
3236000	3239000	Like they're just looking at the moon.
3239000	3241000	Like, what would it be like there?
3241000	3247000	You could live in a crater and no one would ever fuck with you.
3247000	3248000	Just keep looking at it.
3248000	3250000	Just suck it up into my eyeballs
3250000	3253000	for another six hours of data entry.
3253000	3255000	And I finally couldn't stand it.
3255000	3256000	I was like, what?
3256000	3257000	I just stopped this one lady.
3257000	3259000	I was like, it didn't stop her.
3259000	3260000	She stopped me.
3260000	3262000	Whatever, Harmon.
3262000	3264000	There was a footnote session.
3264000	3266000	I said, what is everybody looking at?
3266000	3267000	I'm really sorry.
3267000	3269000	And she's like, you don't know?
3269000	3273000	And I was like, I don't know.
3273000	3276000	She's like, the space shuttle's coming.
3276000	3278000	I was like, what do you mean it's coming?
3278000	3281000	Like, what do you mean?
3282000	3283000	I still didn't understand.
3283000	3286000	The Wells Fargo wagons are coming.
3286000	3287000	They got honey.
3287000	3289000	They got scarves.
3289000	3291000	I didn't do scarf from Neptune.
3291000	3294000	I thought, did they decommission that fucking thing?
3294000	3295000	What do you mean?
3295000	3298000	Why is it coming to Los Angeles?
3298000	3300000	What is it doing here?
3300000	3303000	Looks like space shuttle's coming.
3303000	3306000	I just kept walking between people
3306000	3309000	and went into an empty PF Changs or something.
3309000	3312000	And it was like, give me everything you have behind the bar,
3312000	3314000	because I had to go back to jury duty, watch that,
3314000	3315000	figured it out on the TV.
3315000	3317000	And they're like, oh, they're taking the space shuttle
3317000	3318000	everywhere.
3318000	3320000	They're flying it all around all over the goddamn place
3320000	3322000	for some reason, some weird.
3322000	3325000	While you were there, I got a text
3325000	3328000	from Dino and you saying the space shuttle's flying around.
3328000	3329000	Right.
3329000	3331000	And Dino was saying he was at the drawing room,
3331000	3332000	our little local bar.
3332000	3333000	And it flew right over the drawing room.
3333000	3334000	And I was like, what?
3334000	3338000	As I lived half a mile, quarter of a mile from there,
3338000	3339000	I didn't hear it go by.
3339000	3342000	And so I was sitting on my toilet, taking a shit, as one does.
3342000	3346000	And I hear, oh.
3346000	3348000	And I was like, please let my phone be here.
3348000	3350000	And I grabbed my phone, pulled the blinds up,
3350000	3352000	and I have a shot that I put on Instagram
3352000	3356000	of the space shuttle flying over my bathroom window.
3356000	3358000	I just watched it on the news.
3358000	3359000	That's awesome.
3359000	3361000	Everyone in the bar was watching on the TV, and they were going,
3361000	3362000	it's coming, it's coming.
3362000	3365000	And then they kept running out.
3366000	3370000	I was like, it looks better on the TV, way better.
3370000	3371000	I don't know.
3371000	3372000	No, it looked pretty cool.
3372000	3374000	I have friends that were like, oh, downtown.
3374000	3375000	Also, there's a cash register here now.
3375000	3376000	It was really low.
3376000	3378000	They flew that thing incredibly low.
3378000	3380000	So I go, because they were tooling it.
3380000	3383000	I guess that's kind of cool that they were just showing it off.
3383000	3385000	I would say fuck you to the rest of the cities that bid to have it
3385000	3386000	in their museum.
3386000	3388000	And it was like, we've got your space shuttle, fucker.
3388000	3391000	It was like, LA going, yeah, it's cool to be in LA.
3391000	3394000	There's more here than just riots.
3394000	3398000	There's outer space.
3398000	3400000	Hey, hey, hey, black people.
3400000	3406000	We may expand out so much that you stop being the victims of crime.
3406000	3407000	Wow.
3407000	3408000	Nanoo.
3408000	3409000	Nanoo.
3409000	3410000	That was reverse rate.
3410000	3414000	I was being Alan Alda about that.
3414000	3418000	So I traipsed my corpse back to the courthouse.
3418000	3421000	And we wait again for another hour and a half.
3421000	3428000	So to recap here, from morning to lunch, we were just waiting.
3428000	3430000	And something weird happened.
3430000	3432000	And then the bailiff just told us to fuck off and go have lunch
3432000	3433000	and come back.
3433000	3434000	So we all come back.
3434000	3436000	So now I've been downtown all day.
3436000	3437000	I come back.
3437000	3438000	We wait another hour.
3438000	3441000	The bailiff comes out and goes like, oh, I'm sorry.
3441000	3442000	He goes, come on in, guys.
3442000	3443000	We all shuffle in.
3443000	3447000	And we knew something was fishy because he didn't tell us,
3447000	3450000	six, seven, four, go to the left.
3450000	3452000	It was just like, get in here, assholes.
3452000	3454000	And so we all shuffled in and sat down.
3454000	3459000	And the judge was like, well, uh, uh, uh.
3459000	3460000	Johnny Carson.
3460000	3462000	This is weird, wild stuff.
3462000	3465000	But you're free to go.
3465000	3467000	And he didn't explain anything.
3467000	3469000	He's like, you're free to go.
3469000	3470000	OK.
3470000	3471000	All right.
3471000	3473000	I was like, what happened yesterday at the elevators?
3473000	3475000	And I saw one of the attorneys.
3475000	3479000	And they tell you, don't talk to the attorneys until after the case.
3479000	3482000	And so as I said, one of them waiting for the elevator,
3482000	3484000	the case is over, right?
3484000	3486000	So can I ask you what happened?
3486000	3489000	And the prosecutor looked at the DA.
3489000	3491000	Am I getting those terms right?
3491000	3493000	Probably assisted DA.
3493000	3494000	Well, yeah.
3494000	3495000	I'm sure I wasn't.
3495000	3496000	Yeah.
3496000	3498000	Sam Waterston wasn't there.
3498000	3501000	But I just mean, they were the two opposing attorneys.
3501000	3503000	And they kind of looked at each other as if to ask themselves,
3503000	3505000	like, is it OK to answer the question?
3505000	3510000	And then said, yeah, he didn't show up.
3510000	3514000	So this kid who needed a translator in court because he was like,
3514000	3515000	it was a gang thing.
3515000	3517000	Like, he stabbed somebody.
3517000	3519000	And I'm assuming I'm allowed to talk about this now.
3519000	3521000	I'm not blowing the roof off of this thing.
3521000	3524000	There was a stabbing and blah, blah, blah.
3524000	3526000	And he had a translator in the courtroom.
3526000	3528000	And the translators could only work in shifts.
3528000	3530000	So there was always some James Carville guy walking in
3530000	3532000	and training on it, tagging out.
3532000	3534000	It was the weirdest thing in the world.
3534000	3537000	This kid just sat there for a day, wasted my fucking time.
3537000	3540000	Don't stab me, kid, if you're listening.
3540000	3543000	And then the next day, he was like, fuck this.
3543000	3544000	He just left.
3544000	3545000	He just boned out.
3545000	3547000	Yeah.
3547000	3549000	I guess it's what I do.
3549000	3553000	If I stabbed someone or didn't, and everyone thought I did.
3553000	3555000	Maybe he stole the space shuttle.
3555000	3557000	It might have been him in the space shuttle.
3557000	3559000	All right, stupid jury duty.
3559000	3561000	We spent the whole night talking about jury duty.
3561000	3563000	Real quick, when I was sitting in the big,
3563000	3565000	like when you sit out in the gallery out there,
3565000	3566000	and they're saying, like, who has conflicts?
3566000	3567000	Who has this?
3567000	3568000	And you all write it down.
3568000	3569000	You hope you get kicked out.
3569000	3570000	And they're going to, I have a thing.
3570000	3571000	I'm going out of town.
3571000	3572000	There's a vacation.
3572000	3573000	Yeah.
3573000	3574000	When you're going, OK, I'll keep that in mind.
3574000	3575000	Stay.
3575000	3577000	Oh, you can go.
3577000	3579000	You're taking care of an elderly woman.
3579000	3581000	You can leave.
3581000	3583000	Some people were kind of on hold.
3583000	3584000	And she comes to me.
3584000	3586000	And I had all these improv show dates,
3586000	3589000	like traveling around during improv comedy.
3589000	3590000	I wrote them all down.
3590000	3591000	I was already contracted to go.
3591000	3593000	And so this judge, and she was kind of this tough lady.
3593000	3596000	And she's like, all right, Jeff Davis says,
3596000	3598000	you're going to be out of town through January, this
3598000	3599000	and that and that.
3599000	3600000	Then in February, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3600000	3602000	And that's about half of the dates and things.
3602000	3604000	She says, what do you do?
3604000	3606000	I go, I just do comedy shows.
3606000	3608000	And she's like, what kind of comedy shows?
3608000	3610000	Like improvisation.
3610000	3613000	There's like 100 people in there who have interesting lives
3613000	3615000	or mundane lives or whatever.
3615000	3618000	Like, you heard a lot of very specific shit.
3618000	3619000	This is a new one.
3619000	3620000	Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
3620000	3622000	I kept recording it because I was like, shit.
3622000	3626000	I work like for hours coming up with people are standing up
3626000	3628000	like we're just so specific.
3628000	3629000	You can't write it.
3629000	3633000	And so she goes, and she was like, are you an actor?
3633000	3634000	And I go, yeah.
3634000	3639000	And she goes, are you going to be famous, Mr. Davis?
3639000	3642000	And I said, yes, Your Honor.
3642000	3646000	And she goes, get out of here.
3646000	3648000	Get out of here.
3649000	3650000	All right.
3650000	3651000	All right.
3651000	3652000	That's it.
3652000	3653000	Good night, folks.
3653000	3654000	Good night.
3654000	3655000	All right.
3655000	3656000	One more.
3656000	3657000	All right.
3657000	3658000	Before we bring Spencer up.
3658000	3659000	I brought my roommate.
3659000	3660000	You asked for her.
3660000	3661000	Adam, we were not talking to you.
3661000	3662000	Bring her up.
3662000	3663000	All right.
3663000	3664000	Adam, no.
3664000	3666000	Well, I asked Adam to bring his roommate here.
3666000	3667000	Oh, OK.
3667000	3668000	I'm sorry, Adam.
3668000	3669000	That was precious.
3669000	3670000	Adam has a weird relationship with his roommate
3670000	3671000	that I want to explore up there.
3671000	3674000	Adam has a weird relationship with me.
3674000	3677000	Adam is going to bring humanity up his roommate.
3677000	3680000	And we're going to get to the bottom of why things are so
3680000	3685000	uncomfortable between us in the apartment called Earth.
3688000	3704000	I was in the green room with our friend that does not exist,
3705000	3707000	documentarian Neil Berkeley.
3707000	3708000	Yes.
3708000	3710000	World famous who is a fly on the wall.
3710000	3711000	He does not exist.
3711000	3713000	He's not making a movie about us going on tour.
3713000	3714000	He does not exist.
3714000	3716000	He's not a person that is going to be in the movie.
3716000	3717000	So everything I say about it.
3717000	3722000	But I wanted to talk like he was shooting me and he asked questions.
3722000	3723000	You know, he wants information.
3723000	3726000	He says, like, so what do you what do you what do you think?
3726000	3728000	What do you think you're going to do tonight or somebody?
3728000	3729000	He's not that lame.
3729000	3732000	I don't remember what he's asking me.
3732000	3735000	But I was going like, yeah, well, the thing is, we're doing this.
3735000	3737000	And I've always thought that you should do this.
3737000	3738000	And I want to try this.
3738000	3743000	And there was a point where he said I may be mischaracterizing it,
3743000	3744000	but this is how I perceived it.
3744000	3750000	He went like, so is this how you really talk?
3750000	3752000	Is this who you really are?
3752000	3754000	Like he was kind of like he's like a documentarian.
3754000	3756000	He was going like, wait a minute.
3756000	3758000	What the fuck's going on?
3758000	3760000	Are you are you always this retarded?
3760000	3761000	No, he didn't say that.
3761000	3765000	That's how I was like, is this how you talk?
3765000	3769000	And I was like, I think I think so.
3769000	3770000	I don't know.
3770000	3771000	I don't know.
3771000	3773000	I'm perfectly willing to accept that it's not.
3773000	3774000	I don't know.
3774000	3775000	There's a camera on me and I'm talking.
3775000	3780000	I'm like, I just want to, you know, you're very, very loquacious.
3780000	3782000	That's all.
3782000	3784000	I didn't want to throw him into the bus.
3784000	3786000	I want to I wanted to talk about my anxieties that that causes.
3786000	3787000	Right.
3787000	3789000	About what do you do when someone asks you that?
3789000	3790000	Is this how you really talk?
3790000	3792000	I thought I couldn't tell what you were going to say.
3792000	3795000	Like he was making fun of a stammer or no, no, no, no.
3795000	3799000	I think he meant like I was always on.
3799000	3801000	Oh, who's who said that?
3801000	3802000	Fuck you.
3802000	3803000	No, I'm kidding.
3803000	3804000	Not fuck you.
3804000	3805000	Who said that though?
3805000	3807000	Oh, oh, Jesus said that.
3807000	3808000	I that's what I thought he meant.
3808000	3810000	The Jesus called out always on.
3810000	3812000	That's what I thought he meant.
3812000	3813000	Like that's what I was like.
3813000	3814000	I guess it's possible.
3814000	3816000	I may be overly conscious of the camera.
3816000	3818000	I am talking after all to a camera.
3818000	3822000	So I'm probably not acting completely like I normally would.
3822000	3823000	So that's what I know.
3823000	3828000	But I was it threw me and it made me wonder if I'm a human being or not.
3828000	3830000	Right.
3830000	3831000	What was the verdict?
3831000	3832000	I don't know.
3832000	3833000	I don't have no idea.
3833000	3834000	How am I supposed to know?
3834000	3837000	You think I mean, eventually we're going to be that camera is going to be up
3837000	3839000	your nose for almost three weeks.
3839000	3840000	Yeah, and I'll get used to it.
3840000	3841000	Yeah.
3841000	3842000	But I don't think that was his issue.
3842000	3843000	He wasn't.
3843000	3844000	He because we talked about it.
3844000	3845000	I was like, what the fuck?
3845000	3846000	Because I'm self obsessed.
3846000	3847000	What did you mean?
3847000	3848000	Tell me everything.
3848000	3849000	What did you mean?
3849000	3853000	And he said, no, it's just that, you know, you're very he said loquacious,
3853000	3855000	which is only when mom always used to call me.
3855000	3858000	How did I segue out of Adam and his roommate?
3858000	3859000	I just wanted to say I talk.
3859000	3860000	OK.
3860000	3861000	That was Adam.
3861000	3862000	Fuck Adam.
3862000	3866000	I was just saying before we bring Spencer up because it's nine nine 20.
3866000	3870000	I just I was just thinking of this thing that happened before the show.
3870000	3871000	Well, what are you now?
3871000	3872000	What are you saying that I'm not normal?
3872000	3876000	No, no, I think you're very normal.
3876000	3879000	I mean, I don't know.
3879000	3880000	I talk how I talk.
3880000	3882000	It's not.
3882000	3883000	So I'm just trying.
3883000	3885000	I'm just trying to express myself.
3885000	3886000	And you do.
3886000	3889000	I was funny.
3889000	3891000	But like everybody.
3891000	3894000	Like I'm nervous about the way I talk because I talk way too fast.
3894000	3895000	I would love to talk slower.
3895000	3900000	And when I listen to the podcast, you're way more articulate than I am
3900000	3903000	because I'm talking at a mile a minute.
3903000	3904000	Yeah.
3904000	3907000	We both have our little modulations of when we're talking well and talking poorly.
3907000	3908000	Yeah.
3908000	3910000	Tonight's a bad night for me, but that's that's beside the point.
3910000	3911000	I just agree.
3911000	3915000	I was just I just it made me wonder.
3915000	3916000	Yeah.
3916000	3917000	I'm just obsessed with myself.
3917000	3922000	And like I was like, oh, do I am I what was I?
3922000	3923000	That's not important.
3923000	3925000	I think he's just a really good documentarian.
3925000	3926000	He's got under your skin.
3926000	3927000	Well, yeah.
3927000	3928000	Is that what they're supposed to do?
3928000	3929000	He's going to break you down.
3929000	3932000	He's going to turn you inside out like a sock.
3933000	3934000	I he's really great.
3934000	3937000	He's really great at that.
3937000	3938000	Yeah.
3938000	3939000	He's a powerful presence to have.
3939000	3941000	I like I like I like him.
3941000	3943000	It's interesting because he's not just a guy with a camera.
3943000	3944000	He's like he knows what he's doing.
3944000	3946000	Like he's he has opinions about something.
3946000	3948000	He's up your ass.
3948000	3949000	He doesn't.
3949000	3954000	He's not going to give no quarter to your ass.
3954000	3956000	He raped you, didn't he?
3956000	3957000	He touched me.
3957000	3958000	He started touching me.
3958000	3959000	And I was like, what are you doing?
3959000	3961000	And he's like, no, did you get in the light?
3961000	3963000	And he's like touching my cheek.
3963000	3964000	And he kind of pushed it.
3964000	3967000	He's like, you look beautiful that way.
3967000	3968000	And I was like, I don't know.
3968000	3969000	Is this a documentary?
3969000	3971000	This is Neil Berkeley, famous documentarian.
3971000	3972000	Yeah.
3972000	3973000	Yeah.
3973000	3974000	I mean, he does it.
3974000	3975000	He's not shooting this thing.
3975000	3976000	He's not a character in it.
3976000	3979000	But he was like, he's like, and then he's like, take your shirt off.
3979000	3980000	And I was crying.
3980000	3981000	I was like, do you understand?
3981000	3982000	I'm crying because you're doing this.
3982000	3986000	And he's like, yeah, you're beautiful when you cry.
3986000	3989000	And then out of nowhere, I said, I have no idea.
3989000	3990000	Like, he had a beach ball.
3990000	3994000	Like, how do you fully inflate it?
3994000	3995000	Handed me a beach ball.
3995000	3996000	I was just like, no, no, no.
3996000	3997000	Play with it.
3997000	3998000	Play with it.
3998000	4000000	Like, what do you what do you what do you fuck around at the beach?
4000000	4001000	Play with it.
4001000	4003000	I it was fucked up.
4003000	4005000	I just wanted to talk to you about it because I'll.
4005000	4006000	Was he holding a camera?
4006000	4007000	Yeah.
4007000	4008000	OK.
4008000	4014000	I mean, it was a pink camera with like no lens and like ridges.
4014000	4015000	Damn, that's a dildo.
4020000	4021000	Why?
4021000	4023000	Why is that too far?
4023000	4024000	I don't know.
4024000	4026000	You guys are customers always right.
4026000	4029000	Whatever you guys think is entertainment is up to you.
4029000	4034000	But earlier, I will remind you that I said I felt someone's poop by fucking them
4034000	4039000	in the butt and you were you acted like Dean Cook was out here and that you were
4039000	4040000	fans of Dean Cook.
4040000	4045000	Anyways, Spencer time, Spencer time.
4046000	4047000	Spencer.
4047000	4050000	Our dungeon master extraordinaire.
4051000	4056000	Saunters towards his throne with a satchel.
4056000	4062000	His satchel is unfurled with the power of a million prem locks.
4063000	4064000	I like that you're rapidly.
4064000	4066000	You said that you were a level three mage.
4066000	4067000	What was that?
4067000	4068000	Yeah, which we are.
4068000	4069000	We leveled up.
4069000	4070000	We leveled up.
4070000	4072000	So can I talk to more than one squirrel a day now, Spencer?
4072000	4074000	No, that's a racial.
4074000	4077000	It doesn't go by level.
4083000	4086000	So Spencer, did you get off of work?
4086000	4087000	Yeah.
4087000	4088000	Okay.
4088000	4090000	I got I got the 10th from the 31st off.
4090000	4092000	So if we're within those dates, I'm good.
4092000	4094000	Otherwise, I might like have to dive out earlier.
4094000	4095000	No.
4095000	4096000	Ten to the 31st puts you right.
4096000	4097000	Well, there you go.
4097000	4098000	Thicker things.
4100000	4103000	Spencer will be joining us on Harmontown tour.
4103000	4104000	Exciting.
4105000	4110000	Justin Marshall, our podcast producer is going to endeavor to release our podcast daily.
4110000	4111000	Right.
4111000	4112000	So that people might follow the.
4112000	4113000	So you guys won't be left out.
4113000	4117000	And then we're going to try to make a big party happen when we come back.
4118000	4120000	So we're in on the 31st of January.
4120000	4121000	We're in.
4121000	4125000	We're at Sketchfest in San Francisco, which is our no offense, Los Angeles.
4125000	4129000	But you'll probably all agree because you're from Los Angeles, our favorite city, San Francisco.
4129000	4130000	We love it.
4130000	4136000	And we're going to be there for a sketch fest and do do our final tour show there.
4136000	4139000	But then then we'll be back here in L.A.
4139000	4141000	And we're going to try to put together like a big thing.
4141000	4144000	We should have a big like homecoming at the Wiltern.
4144000	4145000	Yeah, sure.
4145000	4146000	I don't know.
4146000	4147000	Whatever.
4147000	4152000	We'll just stack homeless people and make a make a stage out of them.
4153000	4157000	And just walk all over them and just go, it's good to be back.
4161000	4164000	There were less of these in Montana.
4166000	4167000	Squishy here.
4169000	4175000	But at any rate, I mean, I think we will talk about what we learned and what we what we didn't learn.
4175000	4177000	Also, I mean, I don't imagine anybody would.
4177000	4182000	But should anybody happen to see us at a gig that's here tonight or comes to our shows here?
4182000	4184000	If we're out on the road, come in or dish yourselves.
4184000	4185000	It'd be nice to see you.
4185000	4186000	Oh, absolutely.
4186000	4190000	It'd be nice to meet any like traveling Armenians that come meet us.
4190000	4194000	Speaking of speaking of Armenians, I saw the Armenian you the other day.
4194000	4196000	I saw Armenian Dan Harmon.
4196000	4198000	And I sang a whole song about Armenian Harmon.
4198000	4200000	Armenian Harmon.
4200000	4202000	Stay away from me.
4203000	4205000	But he looked an awful lot like you.
4205000	4207000	And he was almost definitely Armenian.
4208000	4212000	I can't imagine there's much of a line between me and Armenian me.
4212000	4215000	I think I could pass pretty easily for Armenian.
4215000	4217000	No, it's a hair's breadth.
4218000	4220000	Spencer, how are you doing over there?
4220000	4223000	I'm doing doing pretty, pretty good.
4223000	4225000	Yeah, you look like it.
4225000	4226000	Thanks.
4226000	4227000	Thanks.
4227000	4228000	I'm always happy to see you, Spencer.
4228000	4230000	You're a welcome addition here.
4230000	4231000	It's good to have you.
4231000	4233000	I'm glad to be enjoyed by you guys.
4235000	4238000	Are you ready to be in a tour bus with us for God knows how long?
4238000	4241000	Yeah, I don't usually do things.
4241000	4243000	And that sounds like a thing.
4244000	4246000	A tour bus is a great place to do it.
4246000	4248000	Yeah, this is almost certainly a thing.
4248000	4250000	So it's going to be very exciting for you.
4250000	4252000	Yeah, it's a change of pace.
4252000	4254000	An addition of things.
4255000	4259000	You'll be doing what you normally do at 70 extra miles per hour.
4259000	4261000	Master baiting.
4262000	4264000	Oh, the plot thickens.
4267000	4269000	Dress for movement, Spencer.
4270000	4272000	That is going to be a thing, isn't it?
4272000	4274000	We're going to be together for, I didn't even thought about that.
4274000	4275000	I know.
4276000	4279000	We're all going to be fucking and sucking on that trip.
4280000	4282000	It doesn't take long, yeah.
4282000	4285000	Spencer, I'm going to wear your ass like a hat, Spencer.
4287000	4289000	I've seen enough movies to know.
4289000	4292000	Some shawls are going to get shanked.
4292000	4300000	Oh, wait, what did Goldberg want?
4300000	4302000	Goldberg brought his roommate, I feel.
4302000	4304000	Can we sneak him up real quick?
4304000	4307000	Sure, if that were possible.
4307000	4308000	Is that an oxymoron?
4308000	4309000	Can we sneak Adam Goldberg?
4309000	4310000	Adam Goldberg, everyone.
4310000	4312000	Welcome him back, would you?
4312000	4315000	A measured applause for the return of Adam Goldberg.
4315000	4317000	I asked you to bring your roommate.
4317000	4319000	And I asked you to bring back that plate I gave you last night.
4319000	4320000	Do you have the plate?
4321000	4325000	I don't, but in my defense, it's a very passive-aggressive move
4325000	4327000	to hand someone a big, heavy plate full of baked goods
4327000	4329000	and then ask for the plate back
4329000	4333000	when they're nowhere near their plate holding device.
4333000	4337000	I actually gleefully left it in a public restroom.
4339000	4341000	I couldn't wait for you to ask for it back
4341000	4344000	so I could explain to you, you're a 24-year-old ass.
4344000	4345000	No, you don't do that, Adam.
4345000	4348000	You don't hand someone a big, heavy plate full of baked things
4348000	4349000	unless you want to kiss the plate goodbye.
4349000	4353000	In his defense, you gleefully leave lots of things in public restrooms.
4353000	4356000	But also, not a valuable plate.
4356000	4358000	Is there a plate? I don't care.
4358000	4359000	I have my own plate.
4359000	4361000	I should have taken a picture of it.
4361000	4364000	A bunch of half-eaten cookies
4364000	4367000	and just like two brownies like upside down.
4367000	4372000	That dessert tray traveled over 80 miles by the time it got to you
4372000	4375000	from beautiful Agora Hills, California.
4375000	4377000	You're a diabolical person.
4377000	4379000	I brought you snacks.
4379000	4382000	That's a weird way to bring the diabolical into it.
4382000	4388000	But you didn't bring like a hot, wonderful tray of home-booked things.
4388000	4393000	Adam, you're mad at me because I didn't bring you home-cooked snacks?
4393000	4394000	No, Adam.
4394000	4396000	Then talk to my roommate who's a chef.
4396000	4399000	Can we get a round of applause for my roommate?
4403000	4405000	All right.
4407000	4410000	Did you just throw to an audience intro?
4410000	4413000	All right.
4413000	4415000	All right.
4415000	4417000	Wait, he's physically leaving this place.
4417000	4420000	All right. Adam Goldberg's roommate.
4420000	4423000	What?
4423000	4426000	He just walked out the back door.
4426000	4429000	Do you need help pushing that down?
4429000	4432000	Adam's been given a terrible latitude in Harman Town.
4432000	4434000	I'm not sure I'm crazy about it.
4434000	4436000	All right. Adam Goldberg's roommate.
4436000	4438000	I do have a name.
4438000	4441000	But I just want to say, from that title alone,
4441000	4445000	everyone's already on your side.
4445000	4447000	You're like Joan of Arc.
4447000	4450000	Please welcome Hitler's therapist.
4462000	4463000	What is your name?
4463000	4464000	Anastasia.
4464000	4465000	Anastasia?
4465000	4467000	Ooh, prettiest name ever.
4467000	4468000	Thank you.
4468000	4469000	I've used that a lot.
4469000	4472000	It's people's middle names, like in comedy writing.
4472000	4474000	Sarah Silverman's middle name and the Sarah Silverman program
4474000	4475000	was Anastasia.
4475000	4480000	And Pierce Hawthorne on community's middle name was Pierce Anastasia Hawthorne.
4480000	4483000	Doesn't that mean something like resurrection or something like that?
4483000	4486000	You know, you're one of the first people to just point that out.
4486000	4487000	It's true.
4487000	4488000	Oh, I've read Anna Karina.
4488000	4489000	Okay.
4489000	4490000	So you know.
4490000	4493000	What's the origin of Anastasia?
4493000	4497000	It's actually from two Greek words that mean resurrection.
4497000	4500000	It's a pretty common Greek and Russian name, just not here.
4500000	4503000	I don't know why I keep looking at my Dungeons and Dragons character sheet
4503000	4504000	while I'm...
4504000	4507000	And it says you have a bag of holding.
4509000	4511000	We'll be right back.
4511000	4512000	Not a good interviewer.
4512000	4514000	I'm not good.
4514000	4517000	If there's an edge of the pool within reach, I will grab it.
4520000	4522000	What's on your mind, Anastasia?
4523000	4525000	What brings you up here?
4525000	4527000	What brings you up on stage?
4527000	4529000	It seems to have disappeared.
4529000	4532000	No, let's ask her.
4532000	4535000	You have Adam Goldberg's roommate on stage.
4535000	4538000	What do we have a weird relationship with and I didn't know?
4538000	4540000	Well, I just assumed.
4540000	4542000	You know why I thought it was weird?
4542000	4545000	Because you'd never been here before and Adam is like a regular.
4545000	4546000	That's an understatement.
4546000	4548000	So you would never come here.
4548000	4550000	So what's that about?
4550000	4553000	That's not a judgment of us, right?
4553000	4555000	No, no, I can't stand you guys.
4555000	4557000	No, it's not that.
4557000	4560000	No, my schedule is fucked up.
4560000	4565000	I'm a cook, so I work when other people play and this is usually an issue.
4565000	4567000	Like, I work on Fridays.
4567000	4568000	I work on Saturdays.
4568000	4570000	Can we ask where you work?
4570000	4571000	Yeah.
4571000	4573000	We don't have to, if you don't want to say it.
4573000	4574000	No, no, no, it's cool.
4574000	4576000	I used to crow about it.
4576000	4580000	I worked for Wolfgang Puck Catering until about a month ago,
4580000	4583000	and I now work at the USC Radisson.
4583000	4584000	Hmm.
4584000	4587000	There's an upscale sports bar there called McKay's.
4587000	4590000	Wait, USC meeting University of Southern California?
4590000	4592000	Stay at the USC Radisson.
4592000	4593000	Yes.
4593000	4594000	They do many things well.
4594000	4596000	I don't think they should be managing hotels.
4596000	4597000	Yeah, I thought it seems weird.
4597000	4598000	I used to be that way.
4598000	4601000	That's a weird amalgam of higher education and luxury comfort.
4601000	4602000	Are you a cook, a chef?
4602000	4605000	Have you studied?
4605000	4606000	Technically, I'm a cook.
4606000	4610000	You're not a chef unless you manage, you know, a staff.
4610000	4611000	Right.
4611000	4614000	Technically, chefs don't really do a whole lot of cooking as a result,
4614000	4615000	but go on.
4615000	4619000	What's the weirdest thing you've ever caught Adam Goldberg wearing?
4619000	4622000	He should probably be asking me that question.
4622000	4623000	All right.
4623000	4630000	What's the word he's saying you've been caught wearing by Adam Goldberg?
4630000	4633000	You brought it up on a session.
4633000	4636000	I assumed that that's why I was here.
4636000	4637000	Um, okay.
4637000	4641000	No, you are here purely to embarrass Adam Goldberg, in my opinion.
4641000	4642000	We went, we went, we went.
4642000	4643000	All right.
4643000	4644000	It's a good story.
4644000	4645000	It's a good story.
4645000	4646000	No, what was it?
4646000	4647000	Yeah.
4647000	4648000	What, uh, what?
4648000	4649000	All right.
4649000	4653000	Um, at the risk of, I don't know, I'm just trying to feel kind of naked
4653000	4654000	right now.
4654000	4655000	So give me a moment.
4655000	4656000	Give me a moment.
4656000	4657000	Do you want me to, let me throw something.
4657000	4660000	I haven't ingested enough booze to be social right now or.
4660000	4661000	Pour a drink, Dan.
4661000	4663000	Do you drink vodka?
4663000	4665000	Do you want, do you want vodka?
4665000	4666000	Oh, sure.
4666000	4672000	Dude, after today, I could use a drink.
4672000	4674000	Today was fucked up.
4674000	4678000	You haven't been here to the show before, but I put a Sharpie pen up my butt once.
4678000	4684000	Like, and I'm not, not recently I'm getting your ice, but I just mean like the bar is
4684000	4686000	low as far as like human dignity.
4686000	4688000	Like it doesn't, you don't need to.
4688000	4689000	I don't, don't stick your finger in that cup.
4689000	4690000	I'm good.
4690000	4694000	Oh, because you're a cook, you know that I'm in the red zone with my bacteria.
4694000	4696000	No, you just talked about your phone.
4696000	4697000	No, no, no.
4697000	4698000	I can get you a fresh cup and.
4698000	4699000	It's cool.
4699000	4700000	I've seen worse.
4700000	4701000	I know how cooks are.
4701000	4702000	I've dealt with worse.
4702000	4703000	Don't worry about it.
4703000	4705000	Here's your ice cup.
4705000	4708000	Thank you.
4708000	4711000	Spencer.
4711000	4714000	Wow.
4714000	4721000	Dan Porter is seven ounces of vodka over my finger.
4721000	4723000	All right.
4723000	4726000	There must be an embarrassing thing I could tell you to put you at ease.
4726000	4727000	Okay.
4727000	4732000	It's not really embarrassing, at least not to me, but it was probably so for Adam.
4732000	4737000	Anyway, um, I'm kind of hesitant to call this a kink.
4737000	4738000	It's not really a kink.
4738000	4741000	It's not really a fetish.
4741000	4745000	No, I don't get off on it.
4745000	4746000	That's the thing.
4746000	4754000	But, um, but I may, I can't believe you don't come here every week.
4754000	4755000	This is your home.
4755000	4757000	This is where you belong.
4757000	4759000	I'm starting to feel that way now.
4759000	4760000	I'm glad.
4760000	4761000	Um, okay.
4761000	4766000	So I've been into, I guess you, well, okay.
4766000	4768000	Does that tie for a while?
4768000	4770000	Um, some of you might already know what that is.
4770000	4771000	Wait, what?
4771000	4772000	Really?
4772000	4773000	Oh my God.
4773000	4774000	Zen tie?
4774000	4775000	Zen tie.
4775000	4776000	Zen tie.
4776000	4777000	Yes.
4777000	4778000	Is that related to hentai?
4778000	4779000	No, it's not.
4779000	4780000	Okay.
4780000	4781000	There are a lot of sound-alike words in Japanese.
4781000	4782000	This is.
4782000	4783000	I'll say.
4783000	4785000	Clean up your act, Asians.
4785000	4787000	You've been warned.
4787000	4790000	Like, are you actually pointing at any?
4790000	4791000	Hey, maybe.
4791000	4792000	Who knows?
4792000	4793000	Um.
4793000	4796000	Can't, can't, can't throw a cat without hitting one on this side of town.
4796000	4797000	Misha, you here?
4797000	4798000	Misha?
4798000	4799000	Hey, Misha.
4799000	4800000	Oh, shit.
4800000	4801000	I miss Misha.
4801000	4802000	Anyways.
4802000	4803000	What is it?
4803000	4804000	What is it?
4804000	4805000	All right.
4805000	4807000	So they're basically head-to-toe spandex suits.
4807000	4808000	Oh.
4808000	4809000	Awesome.
4809000	4810000	Okay.
4810000	4811000	Well, that's a cousin of, I, I, okay.
4811000	4812000	I know.
4812000	4814000	You want to come on the Harman Town tour too?
4814000	4818000	If I could get off work for long enough, I would love to.
4818000	4819000	That's the thing.
4819000	4820000	I can't.
4820000	4821000	I'm like, I.
4821000	4822000	Whatever they're paying, we'll double it.
4822000	4823000	What's that?
4823000	4825000	Whenever they're paying you, we'll double it.
4825000	4826000	Hmm.
4826000	4828000	I might have to take you up on that offer.
4828000	4830000	I didn't, I didn't think it was going to go that well.
4830000	4831000	No, seriously.
4831000	4835000	I'm like, I, I work in a restaurant where they're trying to make magic with, uh, seven
4835000	4836000	people.
4836000	4840480	Now, when you put on these little, uh, uh, spandexy suits, do you, do you go about town
4840480	4841480	and you wander out on the highway?
4841480	4842480	Yeah, I do.
4842480	4843480	Yeah?
4843480	4844480	Wait.
4844480	4846360	Under your clothes or just like, like, you mean like?
4846360	4849000	Not, not, well, yeah, I'm wearing clothes over them.
4849000	4850000	Oh, okay.
4850000	4851000	So that's your little secret.
4851000	4853160	You've got a little sexy spandexy outfit on.
4853160	4855200	It's not really a secret if your head is covered.
4855200	4856200	Yeah.
4856200	4857200	It's over your face.
4858200	4859200	Wait.
4860200	4861200	So do you rob banks?
4863200	4864200	No, actually.
4865200	4869200	Well, you go out of the house in a, in a full spandex, head to toe suit.
4869200	4870200	I do.
4870200	4877200	And just go, just hit kookaroo and, uh, just, just walk around.
4877200	4878200	Just because I feel like it.
4878200	4879200	Oh yeah, cool.
4879200	4880200	Just go about your business.
4880200	4881200	Pretty much.
4881200	4882200	That's awesome.
4882200	4884200	And what's the reaction to people that you run into?
4884200	4888200	Strangely enough I don't make a huge deal about it.
4888200	4890200	No one else does either.
4890200	4895200	There are occasionally, uh, like, I don't know, there is occasionally genuine alarm,
4895200	4897200	like, I, I, I.
4898200	4899200	Ninja, ninja.
4902200	4906200	Like I remember ordering a couple weeks ago.
4906200	4909200	I ordered a pumpkin spice latte from the Starbucks.
4910200	4912200	So, so you go, so not just a little stroll around the block.
4912200	4914200	Like you go, okay, you go in.
4914200	4915200	I have shit to do.
4915200	4916200	I run errands.
4916200	4917200	Are you wearing anything else?
4917200	4918200	Just, just the head to toe spandex.
4918200	4921200	Well, this is a mesh suit, so I have to wear shit under it.
4921200	4922200	I mean, over it.
4922200	4923200	It's mesh.
4923200	4924200	Yes.
4924200	4925200	Okay.
4925200	4927200	So you got, you got some knickers on underneath it.
4927200	4928200	Something.
4929200	4930200	Fill me in here, Anastasia.
4930200	4931200	This is new.
4931200	4932200	I'm not, okay.
4932200	4933200	Okay.
4933200	4934200	So you dressed up like.
4934200	4935200	I didn't mention that.
4935200	4937200	I mean, I was like, I'm not going there, but.
4938200	4940200	So you went to Starbucks and.
4940200	4941200	Yeah, I'm not answering that.
4941200	4943200	I got some serious Googling to do tonight.
4945200	4947200	But I wear clothes over it.
4947200	4948200	So I'm not like.
4948200	4949200	I'm not.
4951200	4952200	Well, yeah.
4952200	4953200	What is it?
4953200	4954200	Really?
4954200	4955200	I wouldn't know what it's called because the amazing thing about that.
4955200	4956200	I love the internet.
4956200	4961200	Like, like, like it, like you encounter people now.
4961200	4962200	You get to go.
4962200	4967200	There's, there's going to be like 500 people that listen to you and 40 of
4967200	4969200	them are going to go, wait, me too.
4969200	4971200	And like, what, how do I look like?
4971200	4972200	There's a thing.
4972200	4973200	There's a subreddit.
4973200	4976200	So yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
4976200	4979200	What's the, what's the, what'd you say it's called?
4979200	4980200	Zentai.
4980200	4981200	And it's look at the Z.
4981200	4982200	Yes.
4983200	4986200	And you're saying it's not necessarily a sexual thing for you.
4986200	4987200	Not for me.
4987200	4989200	It seems to be for a lot of people, but it's.
4989200	4991200	Like comfort, like, like maybe like a.
4991200	4992200	More or less.
4992200	4995200	What's the, what's the fulfillment of that for you?
4995200	4996200	Like, what is that?
4996200	4997200	What itch does that scratch?
4998200	5006200	Um, it's basically a, it's either a meditative thing for me or it's.
5006200	5010200	I used to call them hug suits because I'm like, if I'm feeling like shit,
5010200	5011200	I don't know.
5011200	5014200	Just feeling tightly enclosed.
5014200	5015200	Yeah.
5015200	5016200	There's a thing.
5016200	5017200	I have a big nylon fetish.
5017200	5019200	I like, I, you haven't been here.
5019200	5020200	Welcome aboard.
5022200	5024200	So you're familiar with encasement.
5024200	5025200	Yes.
5025200	5026200	Encasement.
5026200	5027200	It's related.
5027200	5028200	Yes.
5028200	5029200	It's like, like, if you take.
5029200	5030200	Spencer, take five.
5030200	5033200	If you, if you, if you take, if you take nylon.
5040200	5044200	If you, if you take nylon, uh, fetish re to, to, yeah, it's like,
5044200	5050200	like you, like, yeah, there's people who want the whole body encased in it.
5050200	5055200	And I remember when I was a kid, uh, when I was watching a Batman and I,
5055200	5059200	I'm pretty convinced that Yvonne Craig, who played the Batgirl and the Adam
5059200	5062200	West Batman series, I'm pretty sure she has everything to do with everything
5062200	5067200	for me, uh, because she had this red wig and she, she was like, she looked
5067200	5068200	good.
5068200	5072200	And, and, and everyone on that show was wearing a nylon something or spandex
5072200	5073200	something.
5073200	5078200	And, uh, there was also a lot of like, like, like, oh, Batman, I've tied you
5078200	5080200	to Robin and Batgirl again.
5080200	5084200	Uh, like, yeah, I'm going to put you in this sausage machine and you're
5084200	5088200	going to have to, I bet you'll never get out no matter how hard you wriggle.
5088200	5093200	And like, I, I, like, I remember being a really little kid and like watching
5093200	5097200	Batman and like, like putting myself in between a bunch of pillows and like,
5097200	5100200	like, like kind of like, like wriggling around and like, like feeling the
5100200	5101200	comfort.
5101200	5106200	And then I saw that Temple Grandin movie on HBO where she, she made herself a
5106200	5107200	squeeze machine.
5107200	5108200	Yes.
5108200	5110200	How about this?
5110200	5112200	Oh dude, that Temple Grandin movie is fucking bad ass.
5113200	5114200	Like it's amazing.
5114200	5117200	Uh, uh, it's, you got, everyone has to see it.
5117200	5120200	It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life.
5120200	5121200	Period.
5121200	5124200	Not as good as Batman Rising.
5125200	5129200	So Batman, there's a new squeeze machine.
5132200	5135200	I was wondering what it would break first.
5135200	5139200	Your spirit or your body.
5140200	5141200	All right.
5141200	5142200	Sorry.
5142200	5143200	Uh.
5143200	5145200	So have we cured you of Zentai yet down the stairs yet?
5145200	5146200	No.
5146200	5149200	But like the, the idea of like, like tight, like, uh, yeah.
5149200	5150200	Yeah.
5150200	5151200	I know.
5151200	5154200	And I, there's, I think there's like people who like, oh, I like to wear tube
5154200	5158200	socks, like, like really tight, like people like, like I want things squeezing
5158200	5160200	me and putting pressure on me.
5160200	5162200	Like, like, like relaxes you.
5162200	5164200	It's weird, but it does.
5164200	5167200	I think my, I mean, I'm not, I'm not saying it's to be glib or, or, or,
5167200	5168200	right.
5168200	5171200	I feel like suits for me, there's a kind of an encasement kind of thing.
5171200	5174200	Like I love the feeling of being like wrapped up in a suit.
5174200	5176200	It's like pajamas and it's like, it's kind of like armor in a way.
5176200	5179200	I feel very safe and secure in a suit.
5179200	5181200	Molly fit you pretty well, actually.
5182200	5184200	Don't take that the wrong way.
5184200	5185200	All right.
5185200	5186200	Uh.
5186200	5188200	Well, my pants just leveled up.
5190200	5193200	Trying to be expensive back in this matter.
5193200	5194200	All right.
5194200	5196200	I've been told I have that effect.
5196200	5197200	All right.
5197200	5198200	What is it?
5198200	5199200	What is it?
5199200	5200200	What does Adam eat by default?
5200200	5202200	Like, what's on his side of the fridge?
5202200	5203200	Yeah.
5203200	5204200	No, no.
5204200	5205200	What's on the coffee table?
5205200	5207200	Like, like, like, like, like just empty blank wrappers.
5207200	5208200	What?
5208200	5210200	Like, like, what does he always just eat?
5210200	5211200	Oh, God.
5213200	5215200	I can't even answer this one.
5215200	5216200	If only because.
5216200	5217200	It's wood.
5218200	5221200	And you're, you're afraid he'll be outed as like some kind of.
5221200	5222200	No, no.
5222200	5223200	No.
5223200	5224200	All right.
5224200	5225200	Nothing but neighbors.
5225200	5226200	This is like, I mean, that's all right.
5226200	5228200	We got Adam Goldberg's roommate up here.
5228200	5229200	I don't know.
5229200	5230200	I don't know.
5230200	5231200	Very good.
5231200	5232200	She's being more soft revelatory than then.
5232200	5233200	No, that's great.
5233200	5234200	Yeah.
5234200	5235200	It's very noble of you.
5235200	5237200	But, but also I want to like, what, what does he do?
5237200	5238200	There's got to be something like one thing.
5238200	5239200	What can we do?
5240200	5242200	That's never going to happen.
5243200	5245200	Should I bring Eric Idol over?
5245200	5250200	And no, I, I just want to, we want to tease him about one thing.
5250200	5252200	Like, like, like one specific thing.
5252200	5255200	Does he have like a porcelain bulldog that sits on his desk or?
5255200	5257200	Hey, Skyfall, take it easy.
5260200	5262200	What does he, what does he watch?
5262200	5263200	What's his favorite?
5263200	5265200	I'm actually the weirder one here.
5265200	5266200	I, I'm just.
5266200	5267200	That's almost impossible.
5270200	5274200	I mean, I'm, I'm, for God's sake, I'm a cook and I hardly ever cook.
5274200	5277200	So whatever food is in the fridge is usually his.
5278200	5282200	He eats, at this point he eats a much more varied diet than I do.
5282200	5286200	I'm like, I subsist on whatever leftovers I can get from the restaurant,
5286200	5288200	despite being able to afford more than that.
5288200	5289200	I just don't have time.
5289200	5291200	Goldberg continues to elude us.
5293200	5294200	He's normal.
5294200	5295200	Oh my God.
5295200	5296200	We're going to get you.
5296200	5297200	He's not normal.
5297200	5298200	We're going to get you Goldberg.
5298200	5299200	We're going to bring his mother up next week and she's going to be like,
5299200	5300200	I don't know.
5300200	5301200	I felt something down there.
5301200	5303200	And then it was just, I heard a skateboard and he was gone.
5304200	5305200	God damn it.
5305200	5306200	I want deal.
5308200	5309200	Wow.
5309200	5310200	Is he, is he Soviet?
5310200	5311200	What?
5311200	5313200	What does he want from us?
5314200	5315200	All right.
5315200	5316200	Well, anything, anything.
5316200	5317200	I'm about to say this.
5317200	5319200	Anything you want to plug while you're up here?
5320200	5323200	You get to, you get to, you've been very gracious and very revelatory.
5323200	5325200	Anything you want to say to America?
5325200	5327200	Not America.
5327200	5328200	That was, that's presumptuous.
5328200	5331200	Anything you want to say to the thousand people who listen to the show?
5332200	5333200	350.
5335200	5337200	That would have been my college radio DJ days.
5337200	5340200	Tell your dad you're sorry you didn't call him on Father's Day or anything.
5342200	5343200	Oh God.
5345200	5346200	God.
5348200	5349200	I put you on the spot.
5349200	5350200	I do.
5350200	5351200	I'm a bad interviewer.
5351200	5352200	No, hardly.
5352200	5355200	It's just, I, it's something I don't really have an answer to.
5355200	5358200	I'm like, anything I want America to know?
5358200	5361200	I mean, if you had needs, you couldn't live with Adam Goldberg.
5366200	5367200	That was mean.
5368200	5371200	I go, I go where the, I go where the, you know, the pellet gives me the honey.
5371200	5374200	You know, I find that making fun of Adam gets me laughs.
5374200	5376200	So do you, do you owe him money?
5376200	5377200	Does he have something on you?
5377200	5380200	Is there some sort of weird blackmail thing going on right now?
5380200	5383200	Besides what I told you about now, everyone else knows about.
5383200	5384200	Not really.
5384200	5385200	And Starbucks.
5385200	5386200	You just went into Starbucks.
5386200	5387200	You don't care.
5387200	5388200	No, not, not just Starbucks.
5388200	5389200	The hardware.
5389200	5392200	Have you and Adam ever, have you and Adam ever made out?
5392200	5393200	No.
5398200	5399200	Will they?
5399200	5401200	Oh, I know you were entertaining thoughts at one point.
5401200	5402200	Yeah.
5402200	5403200	Oh, here we go.
5404200	5406200	Does he, does he, does he play video games?
5406200	5407200	Does he?
5407200	5408200	Yeah.
5408200	5409200	But how is that strange?
5409200	5410200	I'm like, no, I just want to details.
5410200	5412200	Does he throw knives at a board?
5412200	5413200	Like, like.
5413200	5415200	He's home all day.
5416200	5419200	I'm like the perfect roommate because I'm never home.
5419200	5420200	All right.
5420200	5421200	Well, thanks.
5421200	5422200	Thanks, Adam.
5422200	5423200	That was fascinating.
5423200	5424200	Anastasia.
5424200	5425200	Anastasia.
5425200	5426200	Anastasia.
5426200	5427200	Anastasia.
5427200	5433200	Thank you so much for coming up and bearing your humanity to us.
5433200	5437200	And resurrecting Adam's character on this show.
5437200	5438200	Once again.
5438200	5439200	Oh, you're pretty welcome.
5439200	5440200	Once you have eyes in.
5440200	5441200	Okay.
5441200	5442200	God damn it.
5442200	5443200	We really fucked up.
5443200	5444200	We went too long.
5444200	5445200	No problem.
5445200	5446200	Spencer.
5446200	5447200	Spencer.
5447200	5448200	Spencer.
5448200	5449200	Spencer.
5449200	5450200	All right, Spencer.
5450200	5451200	Dungeons and Dragons speed round.
5451200	5453200	Time for Dungeons and Dragons.
5453200	5455200	Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
5455200	5458200	It's a special segment.
5459200	5463200	Where we play Dungeons and Dragons in 10 minutes and get the fuck out of here.
5463200	5464200	Sorry.
5464200	5465200	Dungeons and Dragons.
5465200	5466200	The introduction segment.
5466200	5469200	After tussling with a gelatinous cube in a pit.
5469200	5470200	No.
5470200	5472200	Our heroes came upon a horrendous scene.
5472200	5475200	A vicious barbarian raid on the White Skull Knoll Village.
5475200	5480200	It was here that Sharpie's father, Lord Mango Butzalot, revealed himself.
5480200	5482200	Hurdling headlong at the party.
5482200	5486200	Swords and spells flew as the forces clashed.
5486200	5490200	But when the dust settled, the barbarian Lord lies sleeping on the floor.
5490200	5492200	Suffering from a face full of magic.
5492200	5496200	There, our adventurers stand in the wreckage of the White Skull camp.
5496200	5499200	As dawn breaks on the grassy hills of the Butz Peninsula.
5500200	5504200	So if you recall, you're standing in the wreckage of this Knoll village, right?
5504200	5506200	And he, like, you knocked him out.
5506200	5509200	Yeah, you were, like, going to drive by on his head or something.
5509200	5511200	And we took him out systematically.
5511200	5513200	And now he's sleeping it off.
5513200	5517200	And you're figuring, you're thinking about taking his anchor.
5517200	5518200	I remember that.
5518200	5519200	And we leveled up.
5519200	5521200	He was wielding an anchor, which is awesome.
5521200	5523200	Yeah, go.
5523200	5524200	Speed round.
5524200	5526200	Level three.
5526200	5528200	Yeah, I got a new thing called Power Attack.
5528200	5530200	I'm excited about that.
5530200	5531200	Power Attack.
5531200	5532200	No, no, no, no, no.
5532200	5535200	I didn't say I want a Power Attack.
5535200	5537200	Are you describing Power Attack for me?
5537200	5539200	I would have if you didn't stop me.
5539200	5545200	I thought just by mentioning I was going to kill Sharpie Butzalot in my accident.
5545200	5546200	Please tell me.
5546200	5547200	No, it's fine.
5547200	5548200	The moment's gone.
5548200	5549200	We'll come back to it.
5549200	5551200	Oh, shit.
5551200	5557200	As Lord Butzalot sleeps on the floor, you notice several barbarian warriors suddenly creep out of hiding.
5557200	5558200	Oh, shit.
5558200	5559200	Power Attack.
5559200	5561200	They seem weary.
5561200	5562200	Oh, wait.
5562200	5564200	McGathey's...
5564200	5567200	Frimmin' Sominant.
5567200	5569200	Cinnamon Mustache.
5569200	5571200	Cinnamon Mustache.
5571200	5572200	Sorry, Erin.
5572200	5575200	Can you play your character?
5575200	5576200	Speed come up here.
5576200	5577200	I'm sorry.
5577200	5581200	Erin McGathey, everybody.
5582200	5588200	As Mallory in Sedana, which Vache Panos tells me, Sedana is Armenian for Satan.
5588200	5589200	For real.
5589200	5592200	I love Cinnamon Mustache.
5592200	5593200	All right, sorry, sorry.
5593200	5597200	So is that where somebody shits in your chest?
5597200	5600200	There's barbarians coming out of the bushes?
5600200	5602200	They seem weary and relieved.
5602200	5604200	They approach you, calling out.
5604200	5607200	Hey, hey.
5607200	5608200	Hey.
5608200	5610200	Easy with the magic.
5610200	5611200	Hey, man.
5611200	5613200	Only using as much as I have to.
5613200	5615200	Thanks for knocking out our warchief.
5615200	5617200	He gets kind of crazy, you know, when he's raging.
5617200	5618200	Hey, listen.
5618200	5619200	How's it going?
5619200	5621200	Hey, you should have been to dinner on Tuesday nights.
5621200	5625200	I'm his son.
5625200	5627200	Sharpie, Sharpie Butzalot.
5627200	5628200	Nice to meet you.
5628200	5629200	Hi, I'm Levi Leonard.
5629200	5630200	We've actually met before.
5630200	5631200	Oh, right, yeah.
5631200	5632200	He just made his pass.
5632200	5635200	Well, I was a little drunk.
5635200	5637200	Well, so you guys...
5637200	5638200	Yeah.
5639200	5641200	Oh, I'm talking to the barbarians.
5641200	5643200	There you go.
5643200	5644200	So you're...
5644200	5648200	I came to stop you because you're headed for the...
5648200	5652200	You're headed to talk to the dwarves, right?
5652200	5656200	No, see, that was just a clever ruse to throw them off our trail.
5656200	5661200	We really came here to this null village to wipe it out.
5661200	5662200	Whoa.
5662200	5663200	Yeah.
5663200	5664200	The plot thickens.
5664200	5665200	God damn it.
5665200	5667200	I can't keep up with this shit.
5667200	5672200	And I also have to confess, I've never read a single thing out of any of these.
5672200	5674200	Never, ever.
5674200	5677200	Like, sometimes we're up against the wall and I'll go like,
5677200	5680200	Snake handler.
5680200	5682200	You want to cast snake handler?
5682200	5683200	Yeah.
5683200	5686200	And I get lucky.
5686200	5688200	But we're level three now, so I'm going to try to...
5688200	5691200	But these are ostensibly people who were on their side
5691200	5694200	because these are friends of your sleeping father, right?
5694200	5695200	These are my peeps.
5695200	5696200	Yeah, those are your peeps.
5696200	5697200	Ostensibly.
5697200	5698200	Ostensibly.
5698200	5702200	I ask these barbarians as a barbarian myself.
5702200	5706200	I greet them with the old barbarian handshake.
5706200	5707200	All right.
5707200	5711200	For the podcast listeners, Jeff is giving a very elaborate handshake.
5711200	5714200	For the podcast listeners specifically,
5714200	5718200	the first person on the left holds their hands together as if in prayer.
5718200	5722200	The other person does the same and holds their hands 90 degrees.
5722200	5726200	And they bisect each other's fingers
5726200	5734200	and then look through each other's hands and chuckle.
5734200	5735200	It's a goodie.
5735200	5736200	Yes, yes.
5736200	5737200	We did expect you.
5737200	5739200	You see, Yurch, he was here before.
5739200	5740200	He told us you'd be coming.
5740200	5742200	Aha.
5742200	5748200	Well, we're here.
5748200	5752200	Again, thank you for not killing our barbarian lord.
5752200	5753200	Please don't loot his body.
5753200	5754200	It's important to us.
5754200	5757200	So, hey, it couldn't be more important to me.
5757200	5762200	I mean, he came me.
5762200	5766200	Now, when he wakes up, how do we get him on our side?
5766200	5767200	Will he wake up in a better mood?
5767200	5768200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5768200	5769200	He was raging.
5769200	5770200	You know, he was just drunk.
5770200	5771200	He can't seize.
5771200	5772200	Yeah, yeah.
5772200	5773200	I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it.
5773200	5774200	I'm so sorry.
5774200	5776200	I ask questions.
5777200	5778200	It's fine.
5778200	5782200	You guys weren't headed towards any dwarves at all?
5782200	5785200	No, you see, the dwarves are our enemies,
5785200	5788200	but that was not the intention of this mission.
5788200	5790200	Oh, that's what you told everyone you were going to go do
5790200	5793200	and then you were going to go on a secret assassination mission.
5793200	5794200	We were really looking for something.
5794200	5796200	Well, what's going down with the dwarves?
5796200	5797200	I'm distressed by all this talk.
5797200	5801200	I mean, forever, human and dwarf have been inextricably bound
5801200	5803200	by human noidness.
5803200	5805200	I have no problems with dwarves, per se.
5805200	5812200	But the Hammerbeard tribe themselves, they're very warlike.
5812200	5813200	They're martial.
5813200	5815200	They're not normal dwarves.
5815200	5818200	They've been trying to overtake this plains for years.
5818200	5820200	You said they're bad dwarves.
5820200	5822200	Yeah, I'd say so.
5822200	5824200	Take your word for it.
5824200	5826200	No, you said you were here to find something.
5826200	5828200	What were you specifically here to find?
5828200	5830200	You see, that's actually classified.
5830200	5832200	I think only Mango knows.
5832200	5833200	Let's wake him up.
5833200	5834200	You want to wake him up?
5834200	5838200	I grab some water from a nearby well and splash it on his face.
5838200	5839200	You splash it on his face.
5839200	5841200	He wakes up with a start.
5845200	5847200	Sharpie, Sharpie, it's you.
5847200	5848200	What are you doing here?
5848200	5850200	Happy Father's Day.
5854200	5856200	I want my cake.
5859200	5861200	What are you doing here?
5861200	5863200	I came to visit you.
5863200	5867200	I was out in the field and I was trying to work up my mage powers
5867200	5870200	and I had an epiphany that I should come in a tone with you.
5870200	5873200	Finally come to take a run at your old man, hey?
5873200	5874200	That's very brave.
5874200	5876200	No, brah, no.
5877200	5879200	Dad, I'm not going to take a run at you.
5879200	5880200	You're a barbarian.
5880200	5882200	I just wanted to be a wizard.
5882200	5886200	Like I came to take a run at your feelings.
5890200	5892200	Your words strike a chord and his face softens.
5892200	5896200	He says, you know, back when I used to beat you.
5899200	5902200	It was because I thought magic would make you weak.
5902200	5906200	But now I realize magic is strength.
5906200	5909200	Magic is the universe.
5909200	5911200	I shunned magic.
5911200	5914200	But now I realize magic is power.
5914200	5918200	It binds my tribe and crushes my enemies underfoot.
5918200	5921200	And that's why I've been pursuing these fragments.
5921200	5922200	Perhaps you've heard of them.
5922200	5924200	They're called the fragments of power.
5924200	5926200	Don't we have one of those fragments?
5929200	5931200	I whisper to Sharpie.
5935200	5939200	And kind of an Abbott and Costello kind of.
5939200	5941200	I think we have two of them.
5941200	5944200	Look at my two of those fragments here.
5944200	5947200	Dad, I think we have two of them.
5947200	5948200	You think?
5948200	5949200	Two fragments.
5950200	5952200	Don't lie to your father, Sharpie.
5952200	5954200	Well, I just can't keep track.
5954200	5956200	Dad, I'm an alcoholic.
5958200	5962200	And often our adventures occur late in the evening
5962200	5964200	when I've crossed a threshold.
5964200	5966200	Well, show them to me.
5966200	5969200	I pull out my dick and balls.
5969200	5971200	And then I say, just kidding.
5971200	5974200	Not those fragments.
5975200	5977200	We had two fragments, right?
5978200	5981200	The one that you had and the one you stole from Darkstar, yeah.
5981200	5982200	Aha.
5982200	5985200	I pull them out.
5985200	5987200	You whip them out.
5987200	5989200	He inspects the dazzling crystals.
5989200	5991200	He says, yes, yes, these will do nicely.
5991200	5993200	And he takes them from you.
5993200	5994200	Dad?
5994200	5995200	Okay, I'm sorry.
5995200	5996200	He attempts to take them from you.
5996200	5998200	And I go, ah, whoa.
6001200	6003200	He just rolled the dice?
6003200	6004200	You're much quicker than him.
6004200	6006200	And pull the stones back.
6006200	6008200	His face contorts with rage.
6008200	6010200	I jump in front of Sharpie and say, listen.
6010200	6011200	We just met you.
6011200	6012200	And I know you're his father.
6012200	6014200	But if you want what we fought so hard to gain,
6014200	6017200	we will exact a price for them.
6017200	6019200	Jesus.
6019200	6021200	He looks at you with a new understanding.
6021200	6023200	And then you see behind him approaching.
6023200	6025200	Yurch, the gnoll.
6025200	6026200	He's slinking up.
6026200	6027200	He's holding a hunch of meat.
6027200	6028200	And he's munching on it.
6028200	6029200	A hunch at what?
6029200	6030200	Of meat.
6030200	6031200	A hunch of meat.
6031200	6035200	I ask him if he likes what he's eating.
6035200	6036200	Yes.
6036200	6037200	Yes.
6037200	6038200	He does.
6038200	6042200	On closer inspection, you realize it's the leg of a gnoll.
6042200	6043200	Ooh.
6043200	6044200	I take an arrow.
6044200	6046200	And I shoot it at his shoe.
6046200	6050200	So it just hits the shoe into the ground, but not his foot.
6050200	6053200	The severed foot or his personal foot?
6053200	6055200	The one he owned.
6055200	6056200	His personal foot.
6056200	6057200	But I don't hurt him.
6057200	6061200	I just keep him like a bug that I'm taxidering.
6062200	6065200	Did you give me power attack to use on Mulrains Adana?
6065200	6067200	Because I'm fucking this close.
6067200	6068200	You guys make the action.
6068200	6069200	I mean, OK.
6069200	6073200	So you shoot at his foot, at his foot, or near his foot?
6073200	6074200	Just to keep him.
6074200	6077200	It seems like the right thing to do.
6077200	6079200	Well, it does miss.
6079200	6081200	He looks at you with anger.
6081200	6082200	All right.
6082200	6084200	Everybody approaches mango without you guys talking.
6084200	6086200	He approaches mango, and they turn their backs to you
6086200	6087200	and whisper to one another.
6087200	6089200	You see him pull something out of his pocket.
6089200	6092200	It looks kind of like your crystal, but it's a deep blood red.
6092200	6094200	He hands it to him.
6094200	6096200	Dad, listen.
6096200	6099200	You said that you have a newfound respect for magic.
6099200	6103200	So I would hope that that would be an entree into a newfound
6103200	6106200	respect for your son's vocation and a newfound respect
6106200	6110200	for the potential destruction that magic can cause.
6110200	6113200	These two shards that we've uncovered,
6113200	6118200	we got them from shitty people who were corrupted by their power.
6118200	6120200	So we just need to make sure.
6120200	6123200	I'm all for gathering all of them to keep them out
6123200	6126200	of the hands of the shitty.
6126200	6130200	So let's not get all grabby.
6130200	6132200	He seems a bit calmed by your speech.
6132200	6135200	You always had a way to convince him sometimes.
6135200	6138200	What happens if you combine all these shards together?
6138200	6140200	What is the force that that creates?
6140200	6143200	You see, the fragments of power are about fragments
6143200	6146200	of the tapestry of fate.
6146200	6152200	You can imagine the universe as the reflection of the light.
6152200	6153200	That light is magic.
6153200	6155200	The light comes through the tapestry of fate
6155200	6157200	and projects our reality.
6157200	6158200	But these forge.
6158200	6161200	They determine what the reality is.
6161200	6163200	With the fragments in hand, one can determine whatever
6163200	6166200	reality they wish and will it into being.
6166200	6169200	You can change the tapestry with the shards?
6169200	6173200	With the fragments of power, you are the tapestry.
6173200	6176200	Now do we have three of the four or all four now?
6176200	6177200	You guys personally have two.
6177200	6179200	One of them is the one you found and one of them
6179200	6181200	is a pretty large one that you purified
6181200	6183200	from the Admiral Darkstar.
6183200	6184200	You saw that red one, maybe.
6184200	6186200	So that's probably number three.
6186200	6188200	Yeah, he might have other ones he hasn't told you about.
6188200	6190200	I'll carry it because I'm very strong.
6190200	6191200	Which one?
6191200	6193200	The large one.
6193200	6194200	You'd have to ask Sharpie for that.
6194200	6196200	He owns it right now.
6196200	6197200	You can carry it.
6197200	6198200	Everybody cool it.
6198200	6199200	I knew I was just trying to help.
6199200	6200200	Yeah, that's fine.
6200200	6202200	I say that we combine these three.
6202200	6204200	Look, Sharpie, if I pull Sharpie and Mulrain aside
6204200	6205200	and say, like, here's the deal.
6205200	6207200	We don't know what's going to happen when all four of these
6207200	6209200	are together and who's going to control them,
6209200	6212200	but I say at least let's make sure that we as good people
6212200	6214200	are involved when the four are united
6214200	6216200	that we can cross that bridge and we come to it.
6216200	6218200	Let's unite these three and then go after the fourth one
6218200	6219200	together.
6219200	6222200	All right, but first we've got to purify this red one.
6222200	6227200	All right, Dad, you know, your crystal, your shards red.
6227200	6229200	I don't think it's supposed to be.
6229200	6231200	What do you know of these stones?
6231200	6233200	Have you studied them?
6233200	6236200	Well, I've, you know, I got some hands-on experience.
6236200	6239200	I've taken two of them, and I, you know,
6239200	6241200	I think I purified one of them.
6241200	6244200	I was, again, very drunk.
6244200	6247200	I'm not coming to you as a proud man, Dad.
6247200	6251200	I'm coming to you as a guy with two shards.
6251200	6254200	And I'm saying yours is red, and I think that, you know,
6254200	6257200	when there are different colors, they should be purified.
6258200	6260200	Naniu, naniu.
6260200	6261200	Okay, all right.
6261200	6264200	All right, take it easy.
6264200	6268200	If I've learned one thing on this adventure,
6268200	6271200	different colors should be purified.
6271200	6276200	Can I try to purify your red crystal, Dad?
6276200	6280200	I don't know what this purification process might do.
6280200	6282200	Do you know what this is?
6282200	6284200	Well, it ain't going to make them less magical.
6284200	6286200	Do you know that?
6286200	6288200	Yes?
6288200	6293200	You say reasonably unconvincingly.
6293200	6296200	Oh, you convince them.
6296200	6299200	Okay.
6299200	6303200	That was climactic and unclimactic at the same time.
6303200	6305200	Oh, yeah, you fucking nailed it.
6305200	6307200	Try to go.
6307200	6310200	Okay.
6310200	6312200	That's how it goes.
6312200	6314200	He hands you the red crystal.
6314200	6316200	Did I purify the last one?
6316200	6318200	Yeah, but you don't know what that means.
6318200	6321200	I mean, you haven't like done tests on an unpurified
6321200	6322200	versus a purified.
6322200	6326200	Yeah, but what did I do last time to remember when we got the one?
6326200	6328200	You touched them together, and one of them turned from like
6328200	6330200	dark colored to like bright dad.
6330200	6331200	Oh, okay.
6331200	6332200	That's really all you know.
6332200	6333200	I turned my back and I go,
6333200	6335200	but I just put the three together.
6335200	6337200	Is that from temple of doom?
6337200	6339200	No, it's from gibberish.
6339200	6340200	Okay.
6340200	6343200	You notice the red one glows and it actually turns the larger one red.
6343200	6345200	Oh, shit.
6345200	6347200	Let's just hope that red is good.
6347200	6349200	Let's commit to this.
6349200	6351200	Maybe red's good.
6351200	6353200	Doesn't sound like red.
6353200	6354200	Oh, yeah.
6354200	6355200	Oh, yeah.
6355200	6356200	Oh, yeah.
6356200	6357200	Oh, yeah.
6357200	6358200	Oh, yeah.
6358200	6359200	Oh, yeah.
6359200	6360200	Maybe red's good.
6360200	6363200	Doesn't sound good.
6363200	6369200	May I use alchemists fire to examine the color of the stones?
6369200	6372200	Alchemists fire is a magical bag containing reagents
6372200	6375200	that when exposed to air burst into flame.
6375200	6377200	It's essentially an incendiary device.
6377200	6378200	All right.
6378200	6379200	Sorry.
6379200	6382200	Why don't you shoot more arrows at people's feet?
6382200	6383200	Why did you do that?
6383200	6388200	Did you think he was going to eat a chicken leg against us?
6388200	6389200	Against us?
6389200	6392200	She just knows she has arrows and she keeps shooting them all the time with people.
6392200	6394200	No, I thought he was going to run away.
6394200	6397200	So I just wanted to keep him still.
6397200	6398200	I'm sorry.
6398200	6400200	I'm sorry.
6400200	6403200	Adventure.
6403200	6405200	Sure don't tell.
6405200	6406200	Mango calls.
6406200	6407200	Well, what's going on?
6407200	6409200	You took my thing.
6409200	6411200	I was just doing a thing.
6411200	6412200	So what happened?
6412200	6413200	You were chanting an arrow.
6413200	6415200	The red one turned another one red?
6415200	6416200	Yeah.
6416200	6418200	One purified one and two red ones?
6418200	6419200	Yes.
6419200	6421200	So I think it's probably dangerous to combine all three of these together, right?
6421200	6422200	It might very well be.
6422200	6425200	I said we find the fourth one and maybe...
6425200	6428200	There might very well be more than four.
6428200	6430200	Can I ranger for the fourth one?
6430200	6433200	Ranger.
6433200	6437200	You range unsuccessfully.
6437200	6438200	Can you ranger?
6438200	6440200	I'm sorry, you guys.
6440200	6441200	I'm sorry.
6441200	6445200	I throw one of my seven knives at the moon.
6446200	6454200	It can't hurt to try.
6454200	6457200	All right.
6457200	6458200	Dad.
6458200	6459200	Yes.
6459200	6465200	What would you think about taking these things to someone that would know better than us,
6465200	6469200	you know, what their potential and dangers are?
6469200	6472200	You want to know what their potential dangers are?
6472200	6474200	Check this out.
6475200	6476200	Sit.
6476200	6480200	He grabs his red crystal from your hand and he swallows it.
6480200	6481200	What?
6481200	6483200	Oh, okay.
6483200	6484200	Nothing happens.
6484200	6485200	Nothing happens.
6485200	6487200	This is true power.
6487200	6491200	All right.
6491200	6494200	Swallow your red one then.
6494200	6498200	This is why I left home.
6498200	6500200	I never said he was sane.
6500200	6505200	He might be crazy.
6505200	6509200	Dad, is that the first time you've ever done that?
6509200	6510200	No, no.
6510200	6512200	This is my third.
6512200	6515200	You've swallowed the second one's the hardest.
6515200	6517200	Oh, so he's got one more inside him already.
6517200	6518200	He's two more.
6518200	6519200	Two more?
6519200	6520200	You got two more?
6520200	6521200	This is the third one he swallowed.
6521200	6526200	Okay, so Dad, what can you do having swallowed this?
6526200	6527200	Soon.
6527200	6529200	Soon you'll see.
6529200	6531200	Are we supposed to cut him open and get those things?
6531200	6532200	Yeah, that's a lot.
6532200	6533200	How much do you care?
6533200	6534200	He presents his belly.
6534200	6535200	He presents his belly.
6535200	6536200	No, that's a joke.
6536200	6541200	I could use, could I use my arrow to do surgery that's painless and then?
6541200	6542200	Yeah, yeah, totally.
6542200	6547200	That's, I don't, what's your surgery rating?
6547200	6548200	That's heel skill.
6548200	6549200	Heel skill?
6549200	6552200	I think you're like a plus nine to heel.
6552200	6557200	Dad, I'm really taken aback by your behavior.
6557200	6561200	I'm not surprised, you know nothing of the fragments, you know nothing of the tapestry,
6561200	6562200	you know nothing of true magic.
6562200	6566200	Can we get the fellowship of the nerds up here to help us out and tell us what to do?
6566200	6569200	Yeah, I know, I know a corruptive magic when I see it.
6569200	6572200	So, but he's not trying to go for my fragments, right?
6572200	6573200	I still have my two.
6573200	6576200	Not yet, although he does occasionally eye them, yes.
6576200	6578200	Jesus, I've seen this before.
6578200	6581200	Sharpie, swallow yours too and then you'll be his equal.
6581200	6583200	It'll be like a toning with him.
6583200	6587200	No, I'll just have two fucking unused fragments and he'll kill me.
6587200	6589200	I don't know what to do.
6589200	6590200	This seems like a great.
6590200	6592200	Oh, he said detect magic.
6592200	6593200	Detect magic.
6593200	6598200	You have two stones, one that's purified and one that's not purified.
6598200	6602200	So why don't you detect magic, see which is stronger.
6602200	6607200	Oh, wow.
6607200	6610200	It's in the way that she uses it.
6611200	6613200	What does detect magic detect?
6613200	6617200	Detect magic allows you to see auras emanating out of things that are magical.
6617200	6622200	As you focus harder, those auras become more distinct and determine the nature of such magic.
6622200	6626200	Can I tell something that's more magical or something that's less magical?
6626200	6627200	Yes.
6627200	6629200	Okay, because this guy's a hero.
6629200	6630200	Listen to that guy.
6630200	6636200	I will detect, cast detect magic on my dead stomach.
6637200	6639200	And on the shards in my hand.
6639200	6642200	You sense several auras of magic.
6642200	6645200	Ones coming from the stone in your hand.
6645200	6650200	Ones coming from the larger stone that's been turned red now.
6650200	6653200	A huge auras emanating out of Lord Butz a lot.
6653200	6657200	And a sizable auras emanating from Jeff's pocket.
6661200	6664200	Well, that we knew about.
6665200	6670200	You know what they say about a gnome with a big sword.
6670200	6676200	You notice Lord Butz a lot is emanating a magic of intense chaos and anger and power.
6676200	6678200	Wait, I have magic too?
6678200	6680200	Yeah, you can't see it though, Sue.
6680200	6683200	I mean, unless he says something to you, you have no idea this is happening.
6683200	6685200	All right.
6685200	6688200	I'm going into panic mode.
6688200	6690200	So what's next, Dad?
6690200	6692200	Where were you headed next?
6692200	6694200	We take this fight to the dwarves.
6694200	6696200	You see, the dwarves have fragments too.
6696200	6698200	They want ours.
6698200	6703200	We need to wipe them out before they finish their war plans and decimate my lands.
6703200	6704200	Where do you think they are?
6704200	6705200	The dwarves.
6705200	6708200	The mountains that they live in.
6708200	6711200	You see, they're using...
6712200	6714200	Dwarves like mountains.
6714200	6715200	Yeah, no, I know they do.
6715200	6716200	Could we establish a...
6716200	6718200	Do I know that I have an emanating...
6718200	6719200	No, you don't.
6719200	6720200	Okay.
6720200	6721200	Sorry, Jeff.
6721200	6722200	That's all right.
6724200	6725200	Shit.
6725200	6727200	Well, I mean, the show's way too late.
6727200	6729200	We're missing a piece.
6729200	6730200	What?
6730200	6731200	Sorry.
6731200	6732200	There are pieces in existence.
6732200	6734200	You have a few of them.
6734200	6735200	There might be many more.
6735200	6739200	Are we trying to find a missing piece or are we trying to figure out what's happening?
6739200	6741200	You're talking to his dad.
6741200	6745200	He seems to want to get the ones from the dwarves or maybe just kill the dwarves.
6745200	6748200	Let's unite forces and kill the dwarves and combine these shards together.
6748200	6751200	Yes, a barbarian after my own heart.
6752200	6754200	Two arrows.
6754200	6756200	Two arrows at the dwarves.
6756200	6759200	Two arrows, well served.
6760200	6762200	Wait, is she just trying to kill me?
6762200	6763200	No, no, no.
6763200	6764200	At the dwarves.
6764200	6765200	At the dwarves.
6765200	6767200	You keep shooting arrows at everything.
6767200	6772200	You just said kill the dwarves and I yes-handed you and said, yeah, let's kill the dwarves.
6772200	6773200	Okay.
6773200	6775200	How do I please you?
6779200	6780200	You say jump.
6780200	6781200	It's a very good question.
6781200	6782200	How many arrows?
6782200	6783200	Hi.
6783200	6784200	Okay.
6784200	6785200	All right.
6785200	6786200	One's bitten twice shy.
6786200	6787200	We've never gone this late.
6787200	6790200	We have to find a place to stop the show.
6790200	6798200	I say that you make a big proclamation to me, to Mulrane and to Lord Butzalot about what's
6798200	6799200	about.
6799200	6805200	Just like Peter Jackson's breaking up the hobbit into three acts, I say you find a way
6805200	6811360	to end this non-act break in a great flourish in a way that you would break up the hobbit
6811360	6812360	to one third.
6812360	6813360	Right.
6813360	6818040	And then as I recall for the Lord of the Rings, the thing that one character did was, did
6818040	6824000	you ever notice when it seems like a story is bad that it actually turns out it's good
6824000	6825400	because there'll be another story?
6825400	6828680	And then the other guy was like, yeah, I guess you're right.
6828680	6830360	And then they ended the movie.
6830360	6832800	That was how the, but we can't do that here.
6832800	6834400	We have more craftsmanship.
6834400	6835400	I just did it.
6835400	6836400	It didn't work.
6836400	6837400	Yeah.
6837400	6838400	Yeah.
6838400	6839400	Yeah.
6839400	6840400	Yeah.
6840400	6841400	Yeah.
6841400	6842400	Yeah.
6842400	6843400	Yeah.
6843400	6853560	We want to thank Spencer all for being up here.
6853560	6854560	Thank you, Spencer.
6854560	6855560	Yeah.

6861560	6862560	Thank you for being here.
6862560	6863560	Yeah.
6863560	6864560	All right.
6864560	6865560	Crystal Stars got power.
6865560	6867680	Power going down to the hour.
6867680	6872040	Got a fragment of this, got a fragment of that, fucked your mama's dog, fucked your
6872040	6878120	mama's cat, fucked your mama in a gnome village, fucked your mama in a pussy-eyed pillage,
6878120	6882320	fucked your mama with an axe, fucked your mama with a hammer, fucked your mama and made
6882320	6883320	her start to stammer.
6883320	6886520	She was like, oh, that's good.
6886520	6889200	Fucked your mama with a sword made of wood.
6889200	6894440	Fucked your mama in the fire, high plains, fucked your mama in the grains.
6894440	6898960	Thank you for coming to Harbin Town, everybody.
6898960	6899960	Sorry.
6899960	6900960	Sorry.
6900960	6902960	A little, kind of the long one.
6902960	6910240	But hey, hey, do you ever have a really big pizza?
6910240	6914680	Sometimes the pizza's really big, because it makes you sick the next day.
6914680	6915680	That's good.
6915680	6916680	That was all pizza.
6917680	6919680	Thank you so much for coming down to Nerd Mel Theater.
