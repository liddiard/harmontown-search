0	25080	From Meltdown Comics, the very last show that we're going to do here, with a lump in my
25080	26080	throat.
26080	34760	It's my honor to tell you that Harman Town is now in session.
34760	37760	With a lump in my pants, let's bring out Spencer Crippenkrain.
37760	50480	Let's also bring out Brandon Johnson for good fun.
50480	65160	Brandon Johnson, and the mayor of Harman Town, is Dan Harman.
65160	70880	Thank you, thank you very much, thank you.
70880	75640	Thank you, wow, what a welcome, and thank you and goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
76640	78640	Let's do a show first.
78640	86640	We're doing one last show here at Meltdown, which was our...
86640	88640	Rob Shrub!
88640	90640	What?
91640	102520	Rob, an unheralded Rob Shrub?
102520	108360	He's rolling up his shirt sleeves like Roddy Piper, he's pulling a Springsteen!
108360	113080	He's doing a Popeye dance.
113080	115360	Hello Rob.
115360	117800	Hello Daniel.
117800	123400	Anyways, this was our birthplace in our home for five years, six years, what it says 2011
123400	132680	on what Kumail pointed out was a shitty flag last week, so six years really, somehow.
132680	142680	It feels like 11, I'm not joking, it feels like Steve never touched me.
142680	146720	We spoke about this before the show, Steve.
146720	153760	Don't touch, oh, I can't hate you, Leafy.
153760	156400	You just said not to do that.
156400	157400	I know.
157400	159520	You did it, you did it.
159520	163440	We have a weird role playing thing where I tell him one thing and he hugs me.
163440	164440	Alright, so...
164440	172440	I thought Brandon was fucking the ice bucket, he's just dancing.
173440	180280	Oh shit, this is great, alright.
180280	185920	You guys know that this isn't mostly an audio podcast, right?
185920	194920	We've been here for six years, it's like the opening credits of Good Times over there.
203440	219880	So, I tried to watch, I watched The Ring 2 tonight, only because I wanted to watch Rings,
219880	225680	and I didn't want to, it seemed stupid, but I was like, what did I forget, I almost wanted
225680	228840	to watch the last 20 minutes of The Ring, but instead I read the Wikipedia entry for
228840	232400	The Ring, and it's still confusing.
232400	234240	Is there actually a ring?
234240	236080	They call it The Ring.
236080	238440	Is there one ring in it?
238440	241920	Is there a ring in the movie?
241920	245360	Isn't it a tape?
245360	247600	You're talking about Lord of the Rings, there's up to seven of them.
247600	249160	I was referencing that.
249160	255240	The Ring is a ring of light that turns out to be, at the end of the first movie, turns
255240	258480	out to be the view from the bottom of a well.
258480	262360	Now that's important because it's one of those horror movies where you spend 90 minutes
262360	269400	going ooh creepy, mostly creepy because ooh why, what's going on, why a lighthouse, why
269400	270400	a horse?
270400	275320	And then someone, inevitably in those movies, it's all fine and dandy, but it's like buying
275320	280520	on credit, you go like, okay, and she was a psychic girl that lived under a lighthouse
280520	287240	and killed horses, okay, the whole crazy movie makes sense, it's a ring of light from a well.
287240	295840	End of movie, go home, that was fun, I liked how she crawled, 450 million dollars, it cost
295840	300360	30 million to make or whatever, so guess what, now we're, do you think anybody working on
300360	306800	the second Ring movie, anybody, I don't care, caterer, anybody, do you think anybody was
306800	313360	like, seriously plus this is going to be like the better of the two Ring movies?
314360	322160	I spent the whole time watching the Ring too, saying to Cody, this is awful, this is even
322160	327160	bad for a Ring sequel, I thought it would be bad, but I thought it would be fun bad,
327160	331440	the relationship between sequels should be kind of like, oh the first movie is called
331440	334800	Tapdancing Cat, and then the sequels should be like, tapdancing.
334800	340880	You think the tape, there was going to be more tapes, like Hellraiser 3, they all would
340880	343800	have been coming down the street, like coming after you, like the tape.
343800	348840	I thought they would do stuff, like yeah, they would dig in a little bit, like the protagonist
348840	353240	would work at a VCR repair shop, like there are things.
353240	360680	So it turns out, that's the third one, still a bad idea, like I wrote Rings 3 while I was
360680	366120	watching Rings 2, and Rings 3 is still bad, like if I had written it, it's still bad.
366120	368360	Did you ever see The Grudge?
368360	373560	I never saw The Grudge, because I figured it was the same, it would be like at Nightmare
373560	377920	on Elm Street, and then doing like Friday, Weekend at Freddy's.
377920	383240	The Grudge is, correct me if I'm wrong, there's like an apartment that there was a murder
383240	384840	in, or a home that was a murder in.
384840	387920	A murder of a girl that looks through her bangs.
387920	395760	Right, and anybody that goes to that apartment, gets cursed.
395760	399120	So killed that their face is scary.
399120	401240	That's the one through line of all the movies.
401240	406000	There's ring movies that don't have video tape in them, but they all, somebody thought
406000	411720	that the through line was the scary face, what Cody and I are calling the EFF, the extreme
411720	414400	fear face.
414400	421240	What's her name, Nan Tuckett, Ashley Judd, what's her name, Winona Judd, Judd Ryder,
421240	424600	Naomi Watkins.
424600	428480	She goes into an ambulance.
428480	433480	She recorded the tape so that she could save her kid's life, and she gives it ostensibly
433480	435620	between the two movies, something they never addressed.
435620	440760	She must have grabbed a drifter, or a cancer patient, or a prisoner, and said, hey, watch
440760	443080	this, bye.
443080	447040	And thereby saving the life of her child, Aiden, which she pronounces with a Schrodinger's
447040	450160	H. Aiden, is it Hayden?
450160	453800	I turned on those subtitles, it's Aiden, why does, why doesn't everyone tell the actress
453800	457080	... You turned down the subtitles to find that out?
457080	459640	Anyways, yes, I did.
459640	464000	You gotta turn them up, you gotta turn those subtitles up so you can hear that H.
464000	467920	I like to keep them at kind of a medium level, I like the subtitles to be kind of like 50%.
467920	469920	You got your thing, I got mine.
469920	470920	50%.
470920	476960	But anyway, did you know that they had Grudge versus The Ring?
476960	477960	Grudge versus The Ring.
477960	484240	Yeah, somebody takes the videotape to the Grudge apartment and plays the videotape in
484240	485240	there.
485240	488920	Wait, is this at the end of The Grudge, or is this like a different movie?
488920	489920	It's a different movie.
489920	490920	Like Grudge versus Ring Requiem?
490920	496960	Yeah, like it just happened, it just happened like last year, they actually had the girl
496960	503960	from The Ring like throw out the first pitch at a baseball game, like she's like, oh, like
503960	504960	this?
504960	508160	You can find it online, it's...
508160	512800	But we should watch that at our next hangout, Grudge versus Ring.
512800	517880	You know, I can't tell which part is a bit, like I don't know, did they do a Grudge versus
517880	518880	Ring at all?
518880	526880	The part where you come to The Hangout, yeah, that's the bit, yeah, oh, shit.
526880	527880	Freak out!
527880	531520	Say chic, to freak!
531520	537680	Anyways, it's only available on Shutter, it's only available on Shutter, Dan.
537680	538920	It's only available online.
538920	543520	The guy from Big Bang Theory is in the third ring movie.
543520	545080	The what is the guy from what?
545080	549360	The guy from Big Bang Theory, the guy that's not the guy.
549360	550360	Francis Bang?
550360	551360	Yeah.
551360	552360	Francis!
552360	557360	Is one of the characters named Bang?
558360	562360	I don't know, I'm looking at this.
562360	566960	Hi, I'm going to be big one day and this is my theory.
566960	572440	I was trying, you guys all, you guys all drive the same way over here, right, so you pass,
572440	578360	did you pass a building today with a giant LED sign on it, one of those standard, like,
578360	581480	red LED displays that just says Frank Stallone?
581480	586320	No, no, I really want to know what's going on in that building.
586320	591200	I kept looking back, I was like, what, is Frank Stallone what?
591200	592200	Slept here?
592200	594200	Is it his birthday?
594200	596200	Is coming?
596200	598600	Owns this building?
598600	604200	Is driving an SUV, Amber Alert?
604200	605200	Frank Stallone?
605200	606200	Keep going.
606200	613200	Was it a cafeteria for aliens and he's on the menu?
614200	620200	Do three more and we'll let you off the hook.
620200	624200	Is it his turn to get his driver's license?
624200	627200	Two more?
627200	630200	Is he...
630200	633200	That's one.
633200	640200	Was he the answer to a trivia question in a jury pool waiting room?
640200	642200	I have a third one.
642200	644200	Does he know Mitch Hurwitz?
644200	646200	Oh, she is!
650200	652200	Oh, no!
654200	656200	Oh, yeah!
656200	658200	Yeah!
658200	660200	Yeah!
668200	671200	All right, let's grind this thing to a halt.
671200	672200	Do it.
672200	674200	No, no, it'll pick up now.
674200	676200	I couldn't hear, I missed the thread.
676200	678200	Mitch, we haven't seen you in a thousand years, Mitch.
678200	679200	How are you doing, baby?
679200	682200	If this is how it's going to be all night, I mean, I don't know.
682200	685200	I'm just saying we missed you, we love you and it's good to see you.
686200	687200	Sorry, I took that.
687200	688200	Yeah, thank you.
688200	689200	It's so nice to be here.
689200	694200	You internalized that in a strange way, but my compliment still stands the test of time.
694200	695200	Your what?
695200	696200	My compliment.
696200	697200	I'm on board.
697200	699200	Is this your last show?
699200	700200	Yeah.
700200	701200	Well, here, at this location.
701200	702200	Sorry, he can't stick around.
702200	703200	Let's hear from Mitch Hurwitz, everybody.
703200	704200	It's good to see you.
707200	708200	Have you met Brandon?
708200	709200	You probably haven't met Brandon.
709200	711200	Well, just briefly coming in.
711200	712200	Great to see you.
712200	713200	Great to see you.
713200	714200	Big fan.
714200	715200	What's up, Mike?
718200	721200	Hey, Brandon, he's in a combative mode right now.
721200	722200	He's a little combative.
722200	723200	I saw that.
723200	724200	I saw that.
724200	725200	I'm edgy.
725200	726200	I'm edgy.
726200	727200	It's all right.
727200	728200	How's it going at Netflix?
730200	731200	Well, really good.
731200	735200	I don't know if you saw yesterday, they used to say drop.
735200	736200	Now it's called dump.
736200	743200	They dumped 25 new gross shows and they're dumping 13 more tomorrow.
743200	744200	So it's going to be...
744200	745200	Have you ever gotten...
745200	751200	You get those like freer consideration packages and like sometimes you open one.
751200	755200	And these days it's just a rabbit hole of despair about peak TV.
755200	759200	There's all the Donald Sutherland's in a diamond heist series.
759200	764200	And the studio that makes it thinks you should bear it in mind when you vote for the Emmys.
764200	766200	Like I've never heard of this fucking show.
766200	767200	On an audience.
767200	768200	Yeah, audience.
768200	770200	You get a book of, you know, this big heavy book.
770200	774200	You know, usually it's like in loose sight and you take this thing that must cost $80
774200	778200	and just put it gently into the waste basket.
778200	779200	Yeah.
779200	786200	John Landgraf had, you know, had grazed my old Twitter controversy by saying the phrase
786200	787200	peak TV.
787200	789200	Like there might be too much TV to enjoy.
789200	791200	There's too much TV to watch.
791200	792200	To know exists.
792200	796200	You feel like you're on an international flight, you know, watching shows.
796200	799200	You're just like, is this in Canada?
800200	803200	And then you walk in and you're like, I'm in the show.
803200	805200	And I don't even remember.
805200	807200	Like half of my friends are.
807200	808200	You know, I'm a big Bosch nut.
808200	810200	A lot of Bosch fans.
810200	811200	Hieronymus?
811200	812200	No, can you?
812200	813200	No, I.
813200	815200	Does he have a show on audience?
815200	816200	It might be.
816200	819200	Ten thousand ways to fuck or die.
819200	822200	The bounty hunter from that price strikes back.
822200	824200	Is that what he's doing?
824200	826200	There's a bounty hunter named Bosch.
826200	827200	Bosch.
827200	828200	I think there's a different Bosch.
828200	830200	God damn it.
830200	831200	Bosch.
831200	835200	The poster of a guy, you know, like an older dissolute man.
835200	836200	Bosch.
836200	837200	Bosch.
837200	838200	Season eight.
838200	840200	You know, four episodes.
840200	842200	Have you seen this show?
842200	843200	What's it called?
843200	844200	Forever?
844200	845200	Or memorable?
845200	847200	Or it's obviously not the latter.
847200	849200	Or immortal?
849200	850200	Or a long time?
850200	851200	Or remember me?
851200	852200	Breeding.
852200	853200	What's that?
853200	854200	Vinyl.
854200	855200	Yeah, vinyl.
855200	857200	It's not vinyl, sir.
857200	858200	Yeah.
858200	859200	There's a wood or leather.
859200	861200	It was a material of some sort.
861200	862200	Who knows?
862200	865200	It's called like men are forever-ish or something.
865200	867200	Welcome back, Connor.
867200	869200	The show is Highlander without swords.
869200	871200	It's just a guy that lives forever.
871200	876200	And Judd Hirsch is like his son, but biologically his grandpa.
876200	877200	He's poor.
877200	879200	Because it's a handsome man who dies.
879200	882200	Whenever he dies, he wakes up in the Hudson River.
883200	887200	Because he's immortal, but he can't just be immortal-immortal.
887200	890200	So he has to like die, and then his body disappears.
890200	892200	And then he wakes up in a river.
892200	900200	But he works at a pathology lab because he wants to work closely with death because he wants to die.
900200	902200	So he wants to study it.
902200	908200	Which makes him pretty handy at helping solve sexy lady murders.
908200	911200	When the sexy lady can't solve every murder by herself.
911200	914200	As strong and as fierce as she is.
914200	916200	As little guff as she takes from the department.
916200	919200	This creepy immortal man.
919200	924200	Meanwhile, the writing room at River is saying like, that's our season ender.
924200	926200	And at least it's up in the river.
926200	927200	Oh, you're saying?
927200	929200	There's a show called River.
929200	931200	It's like watching TV in Canada.
931200	932200	Really?
932200	935200	And everything is just shot in Canada.
935200	941200	It kind of looks like America, but like the stop sign is perfectly round in the background.
941200	946200	Whenever someone says like the police are coming, you're like, the police are coming.
946200	948200	That sounds like a rave.
948200	950200	They're like, beater, deater, beater, deater.
950200	952200	That's not a police siren.
952200	954200	That doesn't affect me emotionally at all.
954200	956200	It doesn't sound like anyone's in trouble.
956200	959200	It sounds like candy's about to be handed out.
961200	962200	So you're dying?
962200	964200	Why is this the last one?
964200	965200	I think I missed that part.
965200	966200	I heard big laughs.
966200	968200	And I thought, oh, God, Dan's dying.
968200	969200	Is that...
969200	971200	No, we're just...
971200	975200	We're going to move into a different venue.
975200	978200	We found out the owner of NerdMelt Comics is a big Trump supporter.
978200	981200	So we said, fuck this shit.
981200	982200	Yeah, it's true.
982200	985200	Every comic book you buy goes to ice.
985200	988200	A third of your money goes to deporting Mexicans.
988200	991200	You may as well be doing it yourself if you're really into...
991200	993200	But you love comic books so much.
993200	996200	You might as well just say, I hate Mexican people.
996200	999200	Anything by Garth Ennis, double it.
999200	1002200	It's like, the more cool and smart the comic,
1002200	1005200	the more Mexicans you're helping deport.
1005200	1008200	Hey, what about this Bill O'Reilly, man, huh?
1010200	1012200	I know, man. How you doing?
1014200	1016200	We're back here in the dark.
1016200	1019200	It's a special Rob Shropp topical corner moment.
1019200	1021200	Hey, Spencer.
1021200	1023200	Hey, Spencer.
1023200	1025200	Let's crack into this.
1025200	1029200	Well, you know, Bill O'Reilly rubs a lot of people the wrong way.
1029200	1031200	Which way does he rub you?
1031200	1033200	Oh...
1033200	1035200	Did I say something clever?
1035200	1037200	He's terrible.
1037200	1039200	He literally rubs people.
1039200	1040200	Oh, okay, all right.
1040200	1041200	The wrong way.
1041200	1042200	Okay, all right.
1042200	1044200	Say what you will about Bill O'Reilly.
1044200	1047200	I think it's very impressive that he's refused to learn anything.
1047200	1049200	Yes.
1049200	1051200	Well, they keep giving him millions of dollars.
1051200	1054200	Nothing is different. Everybody else is wrong.
1054200	1056200	Don't worry about me. I'm still the same.
1056200	1058200	It's weird because he came off to me...
1058200	1060200	He came off so laid-back.
1060200	1064200	It's weird to find out that he was a tense, overreaching asshole.
1065200	1068200	Do you draw any comforter?
1068200	1070200	I don't know.
1071200	1077200	Do you draw any comfort when you hear about these old guys, the baby boomers,
1077200	1080200	that have their little sexual scandals?
1080200	1082200	Do you ever, in the back of your head, go,
1082200	1084200	well, at least I thought your dick's not working.
1084200	1087200	And you're kind of like, well, no, no, no.
1087200	1090200	As you know, I'm a sexual haranger.
1090200	1093200	And we hate harassers.
1093200	1094200	Oh, okay.
1094200	1096200	Do you harassers that kind of get in and get out?
1096200	1099200	Harangers, we sort of stay on it, you know what I mean?
1099200	1101200	Like, we cultivate it.
1101200	1103200	You put in the work.
1103200	1104200	You put in the work.
1104200	1106200	We put in the work. Say what you want about the work.
1106200	1107200	Maybe it's not for you.
1107200	1108200	No.
1108200	1112200	But we're there every day saying, I'm serious.
1112200	1115200	You look like my favorite beverage is hot chocolate.
1115200	1119200	I know I said it yesterday in passing, but you must stay on it.
1119200	1122200	We tell you daily, Mitch, please stop saying that.
1122200	1125200	No, and it's like, well, I'm a haranger. I can't.
1125200	1130200	A sexual haranger is someone who stays just on this side of the lawsuit
1130200	1132200	and legal line of harassment.
1132200	1135200	Absolutely. It's a personality defect.
1135200	1137200	Just like, hey, I just really enjoy working with you.
1137200	1138200	I know you do.
1138200	1141200	And I can tell you want to fuck me.
1141200	1145200	It's the craziest thing, although I will say I go out of my way now,
1145200	1148200	almost not to look at people and talk.
1148200	1150200	It is very hard.
1150200	1153200	Let me just make the case from Bill's point of view.
1153200	1157200	And I don't know, maybe this won't be met with a lot of...
1157200	1159200	Hear him out. Hear him out.
1159200	1162200	Hear me out, especially you.
1162200	1165200	I'm not going to.
1165200	1167200	I'm not going to use the T word.
1167200	1169200	This story is why he's on Netflix now.
1169200	1170200	That's right.
1170200	1174200	I'm doing three episodes of Moon that comes out.
1174200	1176200	Three episodes, season one.
1176200	1180200	Season two is just two episodes.
1180200	1186200	I think it is hard for us not to comment on each other's physicality.
1186200	1189200	Like, I want to come out and say, like, oh, suit.
1189200	1191200	What do you mean, suit?
1191200	1193200	Okay, all right, you know.
1193200	1194200	Like, it is.
1194200	1195200	So...
1195200	1196200	Wow.
1196200	1198200	God damn, my rangers.
1198200	1199200	Let it go.
1199200	1200200	Well, I just show up.
1200200	1201200	Not going to let it go.
1201200	1205200	I mean, I would have started with black, but that's...
1205200	1207200	That's all I see.
1208200	1212200	Race and then gender in that order.
1212200	1215200	Because I can let your race go if you're a man.
1215200	1219200	Well, you know, as you know, I'm sort of famously colorblind.
1219200	1220200	Right.
1220200	1223200	But I'm not going to take any shit from some blue guy.
1223200	1225200	What?
1225200	1226200	What, did I get him off the stage?
1226200	1228200	Either way I lose.
1228200	1233200	From black to blue, the Brandon Johnson story.
1233200	1235200	Blue like me.
1236200	1239200	Call me a motherfucking smurf.
1240200	1242200	I want to call that black and blue.
1242200	1244200	No, it's thrilling to see him go down.
1244200	1246200	And then you have to worry that you're just liking it
1246200	1249200	because you're just seeing somebody get there, come up and see.
1249200	1250200	You have to kind of...
1250200	1251200	And also kind of...
1251200	1253200	You don't have to be too tribal about it, but you're just so happy to see.
1253200	1256200	And it's just constantly frustrating that they never learn.
1256200	1259200	The Trump thing, I think what's maddening about the Trump thing
1259200	1262200	is you keep waiting for him to say like,
1262200	1265200	I'm just some old bald asshole.
1266200	1271200	We can't get over our feeling that if you heap enough pressure on that spot,
1271200	1274200	we keep hitting the button that is linked to shame,
1274200	1276200	and there's a cord dangling.
1276200	1277200	It's just dangling.
1277200	1280200	It's got tape around it that says fuck you.
1280200	1281200	And we're just like...
1281200	1282200	We just think...
1282200	1284200	Put cinder blocks on the shame button.
1284200	1287200	Maybe he doesn't know how orange he is.
1287200	1290200	This isn't unconstitutional last time I checked.
1291200	1293200	Well, the uplifting thing for me on this one,
1293200	1294200	I haven't followed it that closely,
1294200	1299200	but it seemed like this was a thing that only women did.
1299200	1304200	Like women just kept coming at him and they finally fucking took him out,
1304200	1306200	which is what you can't do to most people.
1306200	1310200	Like women actually got together and took this dude down.
1310200	1313200	Well, because you saw him in the room with the German Chancellor,
1313200	1314200	Prime Minister, President.
1314200	1316200	What is she, Helge von Leder?
1316200	1318200	I thought she was him.
1319200	1320200	He wouldn't look her in the eye.
1320200	1321200	Angela Merkel.
1321200	1322200	I recognize that.
1322200	1324200	Angela Merkel.
1324200	1326200	He's a scared of the ladies.
1326200	1327200	She's kind of a dog, you know.
1327200	1330200	I think it really got to him, the idea of the tax march.
1330200	1331200	No, she's impressed.
1331200	1334200	She's a little flat, but she's okay.
1336200	1339200	It's hard to be a four as a Prime Minister.
1343200	1345200	I always think the thing to do is to...
1345200	1349200	I always want to come out, because you know they're all so homophobic and everything,
1349200	1352200	to come out and just like, for me to just come out and say,
1352200	1355200	you know, he sexually, well, like in the case of O'Reilly,
1355200	1358200	he sexually harassed me, he was always talking about my ass,
1358200	1360200	and just see if you can get O'Reilly to say,
1360200	1363200	no, that I didn't, I definitely didn't do.
1364200	1365200	No, I definitely did not.
1365200	1368200	We're going to find out that Mike Pence is a raging queen, right?
1368200	1370200	We're going to find that out.
1370200	1373200	He's been just fucking sucking dicks with both hands this entire life.
1373200	1376200	From both ends. From both ends?
1376200	1379200	Hands. Oh, both hands.
1379200	1381200	Both hands and both hands.
1381200	1383200	He's such a dick from both ends.
1383200	1386200	He fucking top to bottom.
1387200	1393200	Mike Pence, our Vice President, will suck your dick from fucking top to bottom.
1393200	1396200	And that's the Mike Pence guarantee.
1396200	1402200	From the soup that is your nuts to the nuts that is the tip of your dick.
1402200	1406200	Metaphorically, he will suck your whole dick from shit.
1406200	1410200	Need someone to help your balls and penis make sense?
1411200	1414200	Call the expert at Mike Pence.
1416200	1418200	But with the Bill O'Reilly thing, you know,
1418200	1422200	okay, it's better that he not have a job than get promoted,
1422200	1426200	but at the same time, there's like this bleakness in this post-Trump landscape
1426200	1428200	where we all know about the polarization now,
1428200	1433200	so we all know that Trump got elected, albeit by a minority,
1433200	1437200	but he got elected even though, I mean,
1437200	1440200	we heard him say the worst things a president theoretically could ever say,
1440200	1443200	and so we now know it's like there's this force field type thing
1443200	1448200	that pushes like class is stronger than, for instance, gender loyalty.
1448200	1455200	Like if you're a woman that feels like you're part of a disenfranchised demo,
1455200	1460200	you don't feel united by your ovaries to some rich bitch in Manhattan.
1460200	1462200	You feel actually quite the opposite.
1462200	1464200	That's what the tables are showing.
1464200	1467200	And I think men always thought, oh, yeah,
1467200	1471200	and I think Democratic men always especially thought,
1471200	1475200	yeah, but the ladies, the ladies, I mean, if you say something bad about the ladies,
1475200	1478200	they'll have no choice but to stick together.
1478200	1481200	Yeah, I think we all assumed that that would be the special interest,
1481200	1482200	and it wasn't.
1482200	1486200	It was much more like, a woman, I'm white.
1486200	1488200	Yeah, yeah, exactly.
1488200	1490200	Like, oh, my God, I never noticed how white I am
1490200	1492200	before they started talking about what a woman I was.
1492200	1494200	Oh, boy, I'm so alabaster.
1494200	1495200	I love it.
1495200	1501200	But watching Bill O'Reilly get fired, I just know
1501200	1505200	there's not a single person on the fucking planet that's been flipped by this.
1505200	1506200	You know?
1506200	1510200	In fact, it's as if he might as well have gotten fired
1510200	1512200	for saying Merry Christmas instead of Happy Holiday.
1512200	1514200	Yeah, well, I think most people aren't flipped.
1514200	1518200	I mean, I think there's all sorts of proof that you can show,
1518200	1522200	you can give people reasonable evidence, and there's all these studies that show,
1522200	1524200	no, they just believe what they believe.
1524200	1525200	They actually double down.
1525200	1526200	Stronger, yeah.
1526200	1529200	Which, as a chimpanzee, like, that's kind of admirable.
1529200	1533200	Like, we have this skepticism, but it's like, it's a gauge that it's like,
1533200	1536200	if you could just put it on pause and shit that matters.
1536200	1538200	We have to be willing to, you know, I don't know,
1538200	1540200	I don't know that I would pass this test.
1540200	1543200	You have to be willing to be able to be convinced of another.
1543200	1548200	Like, if somebody said to me, could I convince you that one race
1548200	1552200	or one sex is better than another, I might say no.
1552200	1556200	I mean, I might have that liberal knee-jerk, and somebody who believes,
1556200	1560200	you know, that the Earth is 5,000 years old may also say no.
1560200	1561200	Right.
1561200	1562200	You know, they may say, no, I can't be convinced.
1562200	1565200	Well, how many times have you, we all know we have that built-in hero gene
1565200	1568200	that's like, oh, you're supposed to be adamant.
1568200	1570200	You're supposed to stick to your convictions.
1570200	1572200	Yeah, you're supposed to cross thresholds and explore,
1572200	1574200	but often those things are foisted upon you,
1574200	1576200	and you're supposed to, but what you're really supposed to do
1576200	1579200	is defend the honor of your integrity and all this shit,
1579200	1582200	and you're, it really is just an emotional reaction.
1582200	1586200	If somebody says, everything you believe is a lie, you're kind, it's not.
1586200	1590200	We don't call it an admirable characteristic to go like, okay, don't boss.
1591200	1596200	We look at, with admiration upon the hero that goes like, well,
1596200	1598200	I'm a Sunni.
1598200	1600200	I'm not a Shia.
1600200	1603200	And I will never be a Shia.
1603200	1605200	I mean, it really is.
1605200	1609200	It's like, we all have these tribal things that even having children,
1609200	1615200	I have found myself saying things about like, oh, come on, you know, buck up.
1615200	1618200	I didn't mean to, don't tell your mother, I didn't mean to break your lip
1618200	1624200	or whatever the specific doesn't matter, but that seems very specific.
1626200	1629200	But no, but I mean, I've even found that I've wanted to say things like,
1629200	1632200	well, you're a Hurwitz or just give them this little sense of identity
1632200	1633200	that they have.
1633200	1636200	And then as I do that, I think, well, that's what's wrong with the whole world.
1636200	1637200	Yeah.
1637200	1638200	It's what we don't notice.
1638200	1640200	But you can't really tell a child, you're no better than it.
1640200	1644200	You should cry because you're not special.
1644200	1646200	I mean, how many times a day or a week, at least,
1647200	1650200	you're in a conversation with somebody who's like, you're collaborating creatively
1650200	1653200	and then somebody starts to go here, you know, here's the thing, though.
1653200	1658200	Like if, you know, people love dogs and you're just like, you're a better show runner,
1658200	1660200	for instance, if you go like, I know where you're going with that.
1660200	1661200	Please shut the fuck up.
1661200	1662200	My writers can handle it.
1662200	1665200	I'm not adding a dog to the show because you watched Frasier.
1667200	1668200	Is that what they did on that?
1668200	1669200	No, I'm not behind.
1670200	1672200	I'm just saying, like, spoiler.
1672200	1673200	There's a dog.
1674200	1677200	You don't call that bigotry against someone else's ideas,
1677200	1682200	but you're using the same reflexive kind of almost ignorant kind of like
1682200	1687200	barbaric part of your brain that defends your turds and piss and eggs,
1687200	1688200	all of which are of equal value.
1688200	1689200	Like, that's where I poop shit.
1689200	1691200	Got to defend that.
1691200	1692200	Got to defend it.
1692200	1693200	People are always coming after it.
1693200	1697200	Things that you secrete, you're like sensitive about.
1697200	1699200	You're like, I'm pooping.
1699200	1701200	And if somebody's like, knock, knock, you're like, fuck off.
1701200	1702200	And that's what you're supposed to do.
1702200	1703200	That's my poop and piss.
1703200	1704200	You're not supposed to say.
1704200	1705200	Get in here.
1705200	1706200	Put your finger in there.
1706200	1707200	Help the turd come out.
1707200	1708200	You're not supposed to say that.
1708200	1709200	Put new turds up there.
1709200	1711200	Mine are just as good as yours.
1711200	1713200	Keep away from my turds.
1713200	1716200	I really want to agree with that.
1719200	1723200	I'm just trying to work my way back to where it started,
1723200	1725200	and I don't know what side I'm on there.
1725200	1727200	You can have my turds.
1728200	1730200	Don't voice your turds on me.
1731200	1732200	You know what's possible?
1732200	1733200	You know what?
1733200	1735200	I brought up in a writer's room recently
1735200	1739200	and was instantly shot down, so I think I'm on to something.
1741200	1743200	You know, six million's a high number.
1743200	1747200	I remember for a baker per year.
1747200	1748200	It's our last show, everybody.
1748200	1749200	Thanks for coming.
1750200	1752200	How much does a baker make?
1752200	1754200	That was always our test of the rich people in the room.
1754200	1755200	How much do you think a baker makes?
1755200	1756200	200,000 a year?
1756200	1757200	500?
1757200	1758200	What's your guess?
1759200	1761200	What does a toaster cost?
1761200	1762200	$500?
1762200	1763200	What do you think?
1763200	1764200	$450?
1765200	1769200	You know, having grown up watching things
1769200	1771200	like All the President's Men, and you see like,
1771200	1773200	you know, we know it's Nixon,
1773200	1776200	but you're watching these guys sort of suss it out,
1776200	1778200	and you know, Haldeman knew?
1778200	1779200	Higher.
1779200	1781200	Higher than Haldeman?
1782200	1783200	Ehrlichman?
1783200	1786200	You know, you're watching guys like, it's Nixon.
1787200	1788200	You know that experience?
1788200	1790200	Well, I have a feeling.
1790200	1795200	This is almost like people who think that the trade towers,
1795200	1797200	the world trade towers were an inside job.
1797200	1798200	The world trade towers.
1798200	1800200	World trade towers.
1800200	1803200	And I wasn't even in that town at that time.
1803200	1805200	The whole point was not to forget.
1807200	1808200	What did you do?
1808200	1809200	You immediately forgot.
1809200	1810200	You had two jobs.
1810200	1813200	I remember because it's 9-11.
1813200	1816200	Well, you used to on Netflix not being able to clear the rights to things.
1816200	1817200	Yeah, I know.
1817200	1819200	But he has to...
1819200	1824200	Yes, the multi-corporate building structures that are...
1824200	1828200	But anyway, I think people are going to look back at us.
1828200	1831200	They're going to look back at us, and they're going to say,
1831200	1834200	when everybody, whenever they brought up, you know,
1834200	1836200	Russia interfered with the elections,
1836200	1838200	and all the people on the right would say,
1838200	1840200	they didn't touch the voting machines.
1840200	1841200	And everybody on the left would say,
1841200	1843200	yeah, no, we're not talking about the voting machines.
1843200	1844200	No, we're saying, but they...
1844200	1845200	Absolutely not.
1845200	1847200	Those are state things.
1847200	1850200	And I bet you they fucked with the voting machines.
1850200	1855200	And I'll bet you people are going to see these news stories in 50 years
1855200	1857200	and say, how come they didn't know?
1857200	1858200	How come they wouldn't know that?
1858200	1862200	And it's like, what do we know about these folks?
1862200	1867200	Do we have enough data to run a reliable simulator
1867200	1871200	of their thinking the day they find out we're voting by computer from now on?
1871200	1873200	And what would it look like?
1873200	1874200	Machines that look like slot machines.
1874200	1875200	What would it look like?
1875200	1880200	Would it look like 95% chance that Hillary is going to win?
1880200	1881200	He wins.
1881200	1883200	Everybody's shocked.
1883200	1886200	I can't believe everybody voted for Trump.
1886200	1887200	Everybody's shocked.
1887200	1888200	Right.
1888200	1889200	Anyway, I think it's a little...
1889200	1892200	You know, it's a little paranoid, and it's a little conspiracy theory.
1892200	1893200	I'm with you, too.
1893200	1895200	Why can't we even think about that?
1895200	1899200	I thought people would be a lot more on board with that idea than they have been.
1899200	1900200	Yeah, they shut it down so fast.
1900200	1902200	Yeah, but I don't know.
1902200	1905200	I mean, I've seen a lot of people do stuff weird style with computers.
1905200	1908200	There was this guy who died on this...
1908200	1909200	What was that guy?
1909200	1910200	Michael?
1910200	1914200	Some guy who died in a car, and then they thought that they cyber-terrorismed him.
1914200	1915200	Knight Rider?
1915200	1917200	Knight Rider, yes.
1917200	1921200	And then they turned out that he didn't cyber-terrorism him,
1921200	1924200	but they said, if this cyber-terrorism ever happened to someone
1924200	1926200	they look exactly like this, and everyone's all like,
1926200	1929200	I guess it wasn't cyber-terrorism, but that's what it was.
1929200	1933200	Well, I wouldn't have suggested it if I knew it was a Knight Rider,
1933200	1935200	but I think...
1935200	1939200	I actually like it better as a Knight Rider.
1939200	1940200	Anyways.
1940200	1941200	Anyway, I'm...
1941200	1946200	How are we coping with our post-100 day...
1946200	1948200	Well, 100 days doesn't matter.
1948200	1949200	It's exhausting.
1949200	1951200	No, but I just mean ideologically like...
1951200	1952200	It's ridiculous.
1953200	1956200	Don't you feel the normalization setting in, the exhaustion,
1956200	1963200	where you're just like, I can't keep being brokenhearted anymore.
1963200	1966200	The healthy part of me wants to move on.
1966200	1970200	Moving on is called normalizing, stopping the fight.
1970200	1972200	But then that's pretentious, because then you go,
1972200	1973200	I wasn't fighting.
1973200	1974200	What, did I have a hanky on my face?
1974200	1977200	I wasn't doing anything badass.
1977200	1981200	But I'm not talking about whether or not anything gets results or solved.
1981200	1984200	It's a hanky on your face.
1984200	1987200	Well, that's what the modern warriors do.
1987200	1991200	But just like as an individual, where you think like...
1991200	1997200	I've gone through the phases of, okay, that sucks, but good.
1997200	1998200	I guess I was kind of spoiled.
1998200	2000200	I guess sucky things don't happen.
2000200	2002200	And then it's all me, me, me, and then you go there.
2002200	2003200	It's not about me.
2003200	2005200	I've got to do more stuff.
2005200	2008200	I'm going to buy a gun, just in case.
2008200	2011200	And just all this energy, energy, energy.
2011200	2017200	The reason I'm confessing it is because I feel like confession's better than keeping it a secret.
2017200	2018200	I'm fucking exhausted.
2018200	2019200	Oh, it's exhausting.
2019200	2020200	And you kind of hope...
2020200	2025200	I mean, I find myself hoping, boy, I hope somebody's really keeping track of all this.
2025200	2029200	You're trying to memorize all the stuff to be outraged about.
2029200	2034200	We've already forgotten about when he was acting like his own PR guy.
2035200	2037200	Like, oh, and that.
2037200	2038200	There's always...
2038200	2039200	And it is...
2039200	2042200	You do kind of...
2042200	2045200	You tip your hat to people who are staying on it.
2045200	2049200	And somebody like Elizabeth Warren I've just seen in a lot of interviews,
2049200	2050200	she's just like to unrattle by...
2050200	2054200	I mean, in a way, you almost have to normalize it so that you can deal with it at first value.
2054200	2060200	I bet there are people in this country who, because they grew up with or work with sociopaths,
2060200	2067200	in some degree, that they and they alone are either more frustrated or less frustrated,
2067200	2069200	but in any case, they're on a different plane of dealing with this.
2069200	2075200	Because I think what's happening is we're finding out, as most hospital staff housing a sociopath,
2075200	2078200	which is virtually uncurable because they don't want to be cured.
2078200	2080200	And here's the key.
2080200	2087200	We think, based on our reaction to shame, which is usually hardwired into us,
2087200	2090200	because when your parents see you at the top of a stair,
2090200	2092200	and your big-ass head's going to take you down the stairs,
2092200	2095200	and they go, Hurwitz, no!
2095200	2097200	The parents probably called you Hurwitz.
2097200	2099200	Yeah, because they...
2099200	2102200	Maybe that's even where some of the shame comes from.
2102200	2104200	My therapist calls it healthy shame.
2104200	2105200	It's like cholesterol.
2105200	2106200	There's healthy shame.
2106200	2107200	There's toxic shame.
2107200	2108200	Toxic shame is...
2108200	2109200	You felt it.
2109200	2110200	There's nothing more you can do.
2110200	2112200	Healthy shame is like, oh, shit, I've got to be careful.
2112200	2114200	My mom just got really upset.
2115200	2118200	So we, because we're built, we're hardwired with that stuff,
2118200	2125200	we believe, justifiably, that honesty has this hugely important thing.
2125200	2127200	You draw a line down the middle of the road,
2127200	2129200	and people are going to tend not to cross it.
2129200	2133200	We think it's because it's like keeping honest people honest, that thing.
2133200	2135200	Well, there's a law against this, so I'm not going to do it.
2135200	2138200	It's our fear of shame, and people...
2138200	2140200	We're fascinated with serial killers and werewolves...
2140200	2141200	Absolutely.
2141200	2142200	...and mafia movies and things.
2142200	2145200	We have a president now who is fascinating everyone.
2145200	2146200	Shameless.
2146200	2148200	He's going, what do you mean?
2148200	2150200	I didn't eat the cookies.
2150200	2153200	You have cookies in your face, and you show a video.
2153200	2154200	There's the video of you eating cookies.
2154200	2155200	Why?
2155200	2156200	That video's not a real video.
2156200	2158200	It's like a cookie video.
2158200	2160200	You ate the video.
2160200	2161200	I thought I was a cookie.
2161200	2162200	Then you ate the cookies.
2162200	2164200	I didn't eat anything.
2164200	2168200	He's not lying in his head because there is no endgame.
2168200	2169200	No, it's just survival.
2169200	2171200	It's just like a naked ego.
2171200	2174200	And all of us are finding out that we're defenseless against that.
2174200	2175200	That we have realized...
2175200	2176200	Shut up, Anna.
2176200	2178200	Well, that probably means you are.
2178200	2182200	No, if you have an urge to yell it out like that, we probably are defenseless.
2182200	2183200	Well, I...
2183200	2185200	But I do think the rest of us are not defenseless.
2185200	2186200	Oh, no, get the...
2186200	2187200	Adam Goldberg!
2187200	2188200	Adam Goldberg!
2188200	2189200	Adam Goldberg!
2189200	2190200	Adam Goldberg!
2190200	2191200	Adam Goldberg!
2191200	2194200	You have 11 seconds on stage.
2194200	2195200	I said his name.
2195200	2196200	Adam Goldberg!
2196200	2197200	Adam Goldberg!
2197200	2198200	Adam Goldberg!
2199200	2203200	I just took another person on stage.
2203200	2204200	21, square root of 5.
2204200	2206200	We need one more, another person.
2206200	2208200	I just need a male voice on stage.
2208200	2214200	Can we get some massive representation on the stage?
2214200	2218200	Adam Goldberg, I'm the guy they hate, so...
2218200	2219200	We don't hate you.
2219200	2221200	We like you as an enemy.
2221200	2224200	All right, then I'm the distinguished...
2224200	2225200	Here's what I really think.
2225200	2227200	I really think it's not about being defenseless.
2227200	2229200	I think we get...
2229200	2233200	You can't help, you can't resist wanting...
2233200	2235200	What happened?
2235200	2239200	They might be reacting to the fact that Adam Goldberg came on stage
2239200	2242200	and someone succeeded in just dealing with it.
2242200	2244200	That you just continued.
2244200	2247200	You're just like, I've got so much yard work to do
2247200	2249200	and I'm not going to let this stop me.
2249200	2252200	Adam, we have a lot of show tonight because of our last show.
2252200	2256200	Let's briefly weigh in on how things are going in Goldberg Town.
2256200	2260200	One, I'm working with Endemol Shine to sell a show, so that's good.
2260200	2262200	Not really.
2262200	2264200	I mean, you can feel the...
2264200	2267200	I'm glad I'm not coming next week.
2267200	2270200	Which makes the one thing the audience and I agree on.
2270200	2272200	Let's hear Adam Goldberg, everybody!
2272200	2276200	Adam Goldberg! Adam Goldberg!
2276200	2280200	That is literally playing off music.
2280200	2287200	I am literally playing you off of the stage.
2287200	2292200	And I will continue to play this song
2292200	2295200	until Adam Goldberg is gone.
2295200	2302200	That's the end of Adam Goldberg's time.
2302200	2308200	And he's still on stage because he doesn't pick up on social issues.
2308200	2313200	No, I don't. I miss him all.
2313200	2316200	Even when the song's over...
2316200	2320200	Adam, it would be a crime if you acknowledge.
2320200	2325200	He belongs up here for some percentage of the show.
2325200	2327200	As little as possible.
2327200	2329200	What do you call it?
2329200	2331200	A fecal implant.
2331200	2334200	I didn't know what you were going to say.
2334200	2336200	I didn't know what you were going to say.
2336200	2339200	In other words, it can promote health in the body.
2339200	2341200	Is it a fecal implant that you go when someone's already in the room,
2341200	2343200	or do you knock before the fecal implant?
2343200	2346200	It's good for you. You know what I mean.
2346200	2349200	Adam, give us a little more.
2349200	2354200	To the extent that capitalism was a system
2354200	2356200	where a lot of people suffered unnecessarily...
2356200	2358200	I feel like we're going too macro.
2358200	2359200	Yeah, probably.
2359200	2362200	Electing the stupidest, most hateable person
2362200	2364200	to the head of the system
2364200	2366200	allows people to organize and say,
2366200	2368200	wait, all these things that are wrong are still wrong,
2368200	2371200	and the best they can do is someone who has holes in his brain,
2371200	2374200	the oldest, dumbest, fattest president that's ever been elected.
2374200	2377200	I don't know if we were so healthy that we were ready for that lesson.
2377200	2379200	I don't think so either.
2379200	2380200	There was a fatter president.
2380200	2383200	That's like, oh, Iron Man needed to have his thing ripped out of his mustache.
2383200	2386200	The shots were really small, and he was a Supreme Court justice.
2386200	2389200	I will say that if you compare it to Bush,
2389200	2392200	it was much worse with Bush.
2392200	2395200	In other words, it will be worse with Trump,
2395200	2397200	but it hasn't been yet.
2397200	2400200	We just didn't know what was coming with Bush.
2400200	2402200	But if you think of that moment,
2402200	2404200	you will never have a moment as satisfying,
2404200	2406200	in terms of exposing someone as a fool,
2406200	2407200	as the My Pet Goat moment.
2407200	2409200	You'll never have that with Trump.
2409200	2411200	You know, it would be such a victory if you said that.
2411200	2413200	He was reading Eye of the Goats
2413200	2415200	when the trade centers of New York go down.
2415200	2418200	Yeah, when the two match...
2418200	2420200	The identical skyscrapers of hoop hoops.
2420200	2422200	The matching towers.
2422200	2425200	All right, Adam, is that why you voted for him?
2425200	2427200	Give and take, give and take.
2427200	2429200	Give and take. Sorry.
2429200	2431200	I've only voted like five times,
2431200	2433200	and it was in a swing state, so it doesn't matter.
2433200	2437200	Rob's about to come up here and do a straight-up improv workshop about give and take.
2437200	2438200	Yes.
2438200	2440200	So I voted for...
2440200	2442200	So I told him to run when I was at his third wedding.
2442200	2444200	Whatever, it happens.
2444200	2447200	But the point is, the DSA of Los Angeles
2447200	2449200	has doubled in size since the election.
2449200	2451200	So people are fighting against a system
2451200	2454200	that's just taking, taking, taking from ordinary people,
2454200	2457200	and having the worst opposition in the world,
2457200	2459200	a cartoonish failure that's everything wrong.
2459200	2461200	But I think that's why we almost have to stop
2461200	2463200	just enjoying what an idiot he is,
2463200	2464200	and sort of...
2464200	2466200	Because then it becomes tribal,
2466200	2468200	and people that support him just...
2468200	2470200	They get more from you, and to care about them,
2470200	2472200	I mean, it's challenging.
2472200	2476200	I think maybe all minus one of the marches that have happened downtown,
2476200	2478200	and the signs are hilarious
2478200	2480200	because he's easy to make fun of, and he looks stupid,
2480200	2483200	and he says dumb things, and he's very quotable
2483200	2486200	because he says, like, just bonkers shit all the time.
2486200	2489200	It's fun to ridicule this guy,
2489200	2493200	and it's kind of this weird, palliative, like, placebo that we take
2493200	2498200	and go, oh, he's ugly, and his hair is crazy, and he's orange.
2498200	2501200	No, he also has hired monsters.
2501200	2506200	It's too easy just to make him the butt of a joke.
2507200	2509200	It's something way more horrifying.
2509200	2510200	I'm with you.
2510200	2511200	It's the argument for normalizing him.
2511200	2512200	Exactly.
2512200	2514200	The argument for normalizing him is to say,
2514200	2516200	okay, we're going to let go of this thing
2516200	2518200	because it's not convincing half the country,
2518200	2521200	and we're going to focus instead on these corrupt policies
2521200	2522200	and these corrupt people,
2522200	2524200	and we're going to do it from the position of
2524200	2526200	we don't want Americans to suffer,
2526200	2528200	because that's what's going to happen.
2528200	2530200	62 people have more...
2530200	2533200	I hate to even include you in this group, but 62 people,
2533200	2536200	61, excluding Dan, have more net worth
2536200	2540200	than the other half of humanity.
2540200	2541200	It's crazy.
2541200	2542200	It's not a contest.
2542200	2545200	So we should kill Dan Harmon?
2545200	2546200	Is that what you're saying?
2546200	2548200	Big, great final episode.
2548200	2551200	If we're going to conclude this season, there's no better way to do it.
2551200	2554200	But I create jobs.
2554200	2556200	Okay, I'm back in there.
2556200	2559200	There's a guy that feeds my fish.
2559200	2560200	Yeah, no, he's...
2560200	2562200	I have a dog sitter.
2562200	2563200	Yeah.
2563200	2566200	You want me rich, it trickles down.
2566200	2568200	A guy who pretends he's a dog,
2568200	2571200	because you hate dogs, but you like people.
2571200	2573200	That's on Netflix now.
2573200	2576200	But I just want to say, I mean, the thing is...
2585200	2586200	Adam Goldberg, everybody.
2586200	2587200	Adam Goldberg, Jesus.
2587200	2588200	Thank you, Brandon.
2588200	2590200	Wow.
2591200	2592200	Let's bring up Dave Klein.
2592200	2593200	Dave Klein.
2593200	2595200	Get the fuck on stage, Dave.
2595200	2596200	Final episode.
2596200	2599200	Get this from Dave Goddamn Klein.
2601200	2603200	Can we get a collective?
2603200	2604200	Where are you going?
2604200	2605200	Excuse me.
2605200	2607200	God damn, you smell good.
2607200	2609200	I'm pitching something undemolished.
2609200	2613200	I mean, y'all can't smell him, but he smells like a million pucks.
2613200	2617200	Now, some of that might be imperative.
2617200	2618200	All right.
2619200	2621200	Dave Klein, one of our favorite Armenians.
2621200	2622200	Welcome.
2622200	2625200	Yo, first off, let me give a shout out to Dan Harmon,
2625200	2629200	to this beautiful space, to this church of the abyss
2629200	2631200	that we all come to on a Sunday night,
2631200	2635200	back in the day when I was laying it down on the east coast with my boys getting grimy,
2635200	2640200	smoking in hell, listening to Harmon with some real grime bags that had never heard of community.
2640200	2643200	I hear the voices, you come out to L.A.
2643200	2646200	I meet a beautiful woman my first day out here.
2649200	2650200	I'm living.
2652200	2653200	Yo.
2653200	2654200	I'm living.
2654200	2655200	Yo.
2655200	2656200	Yo.
2656200	2657200	I'm living.
2657200	2658200	Yo.
2658200	2659200	Yo.
2659200	2660200	Yo, I ain't swimming in women.
2660200	2661200	I'm just swimming in one.
2661200	2666200	I found the one that's going to make a ton of love of yolks of all good times.
2666200	2669200	She introduced me to yoga, introduced me to my mind.
2669200	2670200	She got all the shit.
2670200	2672200	Yo, she came a quiz.
2672200	2676200	She got all the body and she got all the shit that you want in your partner,
2676200	2677200	especially that you listen.
2677200	2681200	Now get in the back, cause we're gonna get crispy.
2681200	2682200	Crispy!
2682200	2683200	Crispy!
2683200	2684200	Crispy!
2684200	2685200	Crispy!
2685200	2686200	Crispy!
2686200	2687200	Crying in the morning!
2687200	2688200	Yipp!
2689200	2694200	Just a final shout out to Harmon and the crew of creeps on the right.
2694200	2697200	And just I want to say to Harmon, you're a beautiful man.
2697200	2699200	We love you very much.
2699200	2700200	Seriously.
2700200	2701200	Thank you.
2701200	2702200	We're going to miss you.
2702200	2704200	We hope a lot of us, this space is going to miss you,
2704200	2705200	and I just want to say,
2705200	2707200	Yo, yoga and meditation.
2708200	2710200	Dave Kline, everybody.
2713200	2714200	That's how you do it.
2715200	2719200	Oh shit! Ryan Ridley's here! Ryan Ridley!
2721200	2726200	Ryan Ridley to cleanse the palate.
2729200	2730200	Hey!
2730200	2731200	Hi!
2732200	2734200	You guys doing a podcast here?
2736200	2737200	Ah!
2737200	2739200	Hey, Mitch!
2739200	2740200	Hey!
2741200	2743200	Is that how you hear me?
2743200	2745200	Is that what I sound like?
2745200	2746200	Is that what I sound like?
2746200	2747200	No, no, no, no.
2747200	2748200	Okay, stop it, Dan.
2748200	2749200	Stop it.
2749200	2750200	Let him talk.
2750200	2751200	Well, I have mixed feelings because...
2756200	2762200	I'm hurt by the insult, but I feel like, well, it's a laugh of recognition.
2762200	2766200	They know my voice well enough to know when it's being mocked, exactly.
2766200	2768200	So, I'll take it.
2769200	2770200	That's very supporting.
2770200	2772200	I love when nerd eat nerd.
2775200	2776200	But do you do other voices?
2776200	2780200	Can you do like a macho?
2781200	2782200	I can do it.
2782200	2783200	Can I butch it up?
2783200	2784200	Is that what you're asking?
2784200	2789200	Yeah, you know, when I'm going to date, I start to take it down a few.
2789200	2790200	So it's a volume.
2790200	2791200	It's volume related.
2791200	2793200	How's the dating life going, Ryan?
2793200	2795200	You're my most single...
2797200	2798200	No, I just...
2798200	2799200	How did they interpret it?
2799200	2800200	How single is he?
2802200	2809200	I just mean you're the guy I know that does the most tindering and bindering and bumbling.
2810200	2813200	Don't try to act shy when your ass is on tinder already.
2813200	2815200	Not the most desperate.
2815200	2817200	Just the most active is what you're saying.
2817200	2818200	Yeah.
2818200	2819200	Yeah.
2819200	2820200	It's all right.
2820200	2821200	Yeah.
2821200	2822200	Cody introduced me to a term.
2822200	2823200	What's it called?
2823200	2824200	Dinks?
2825200	2826200	It introduced me to I8.
2826200	2827200	We didn't...
2829200	2830200	She didn't coin it.
2830200	2831200	She's heard it from one of her friends.
2831200	2832200	But it's like...
2832200	2833200	Jesus fuck!
2835200	2837200	You almost killed Spencer!
2838200	2839200	Man!
2839200	2842200	Dinks is a dual income, no kids.
2842200	2848200	It's like couples that have opted out of the whole biological perpetuation of this experiment.
2848200	2849200	We're done.
2849200	2853200	But it's like, you know, because it's like you go to a dinner with another couple.
2853200	2854200	They had to get a sitter.
2854200	2856200	And you're like, we got the creme brulee.
2856200	2858200	And they're like, dinks money.
2859200	2861200	Because it's like being a gay couple.
2861200	2862200	It's like you both...
2862200	2863200	Oh, I mean that's the goal.
2863200	2864200	Nothing but income.
2864200	2865200	Oh, great.
2866200	2870200	I'm not saying gay people can't adopt and settle down and go broke themselves.
2870200	2872200	I'm an advocate of them doing that.
2872200	2875200	I don't know what I want to, but...
2875200	2877200	Are you asking if I hope to become a dink?
2878200	2880200	I just want to know what adventures are going on.
2880200	2882200	Like, you're the guy that I run into.
2882200	2883200	I go, what's going on?
2883200	2886200	And then you'll go like, oh, I swiped left instead of right.
2886200	2889200	And then this person came in with a hockey mask and whatever.
2889200	2890200	Oh, you'll like this.
2890200	2891200	I caught something.
2891200	2892200	You'll like this.
2892200	2893200	Here we go.
2893200	2894200	Here we go.
2894200	2895200	All right.
2895200	2898200	Has anyone ever heard of a little dating app called Raya?
2899200	2900200	No.
2900200	2902200	I got on it!
2903200	2905200	Wait, that's the one for famous people?
2906200	2909200	You have to be kind of famous for that.
2909200	2912200	The fact that only you know even what it is means it's special.
2912200	2913200	It's working.
2913200	2914200	It's working.
2914200	2915200	What is it?
2915200	2916200	What is it?
2916200	2917200	Tell me.
2917200	2918200	It's an exclusive dating app.
2918200	2919200	Well, I don't know.
2919200	2924200	For attractive idiots in L.A. and the world over.
2924200	2926200	None of this adds up.
2927200	2930200	What you're asking, I can tell Spencer.
2930200	2931200	I'm not asking.
2931200	2932200	You got to tell them what it really is.
2932200	2934200	You got to use the full description of what it is.
2934200	2935200	Well, how would you describe it?
2935200	2938200	It's a dating app that's secret for like famous people.
2938200	2939200	But it's not...
2939200	2941200	And this motherfucker just gave it away.
2943200	2945200	Which means you're not going to be honest tomorrow.
2945200	2948200	Listen, you can know where the palace is,
2948200	2951200	but you're not going to get over the boat.
2953200	2958200	But that's awesome because that means that you had enough famous people to rep you
2958200	2960200	because you got to get other famous people to rep you
2960200	2961200	so you can get...
2961200	2963200	Yes, you can shut your ass up.
2963200	2964200	Yes.
2964200	2965200	No.
2965200	2966200	Shut up.
2966200	2968200	There's only two guys on it.
2968200	2970200	It's Ryan and Seth Green.
2972200	2974200	So who are you dating now?
2974200	2977200	Can I explain counter to Brandon's theory?
2977200	2979200	I applied.
2979200	2983200	I was put on the waiting list for at least a year.
2984200	2987200	Most of my people didn't have to wait.
2988200	2990200	I was whining and complaining the entire year.
2990200	2993200	It could've been that you were going out in public and being interesting to Whitman.
2995200	2996200	All right.
2998200	3000200	Come on. Obviously I did that too.
3000200	3002200	Come on. Obviously.
3002200	3004200	Make your case, sir. Make your case.
3004200	3008200	If Max Landis dies, we'll call you.
3010200	3012200	You know Max Landis is on that shit.
3012200	3015200	They don't say anything, so I broke out my greatest tool.
3015200	3017200	Yeah, which is Max Landis.
3017200	3021200	I googled the customer service number and I complained that I wasn't on yet.
3022200	3024200	And the next day I was approved.
3026200	3027200	So famous.
3027200	3028200	Wow.
3028200	3030200	Talk about famous.
3030200	3031200	They're customer service.
3031200	3035200	Your whole mom bought these cool points for me.
3035200	3036200	Super famous.
3036200	3040200	You're famous for being the best HR troll of all time.
3040200	3043200	And who was, by the way, who was the customer service rep?
3043200	3046200	Was it like, I don't know, a game show host or something?
3047200	3050200	Are they all famous?
3050200	3053200	It was like season two of the real world.
3053200	3055200	They didn't respond. They just approved me.
3055200	3058200	Can we go through what that call was like?
3062200	3064200	Hi, it's Ryan Ridley from Family Guy.
3068200	3072200	Hello. This is Ryan. This is Ria.
3072200	3074200	I'm also on Family Guy.
3077200	3080200	And we're calling just about your trouble ticket.
3080200	3083200	It was empty, but we're calling you back.
3084200	3086200	Rob, are you playing me?
3086200	3088200	No, no, you're playing you, dude.
3088200	3091200	Just want to let you know, this is quality control.
3091200	3095200	Your call is being monitored by me, Max Landis.
3095200	3097200	Sorry, I'll be listening in on this.
3097200	3101200	Well, listen, I want the opportunity to have sex with famous women.
3101200	3102200	Okay.
3102200	3104200	So fame is an important quality. I get it.
3105200	3107200	It's intoxicating.
3107200	3110200	Aren't you worried that you'll be like, forgive my language for a moment?
3110200	3112200	A lot of people on this call.
3121200	3123200	It's like a Monty Python sketch.
3123200	3125200	Hey, excuse me.
3125200	3127200	Ryan Ridley's on the phone. Let me talk to him.
3127200	3129200	What are your qualifications?
3129200	3131200	You want to be talking to some famous women.
3131200	3133200	You want to be sexing up the famous women, huh?
3133200	3136200	All right. All right. Well, let's hear it.
3136200	3139200	I'd like to do, but I am on this side of the phone.
3142200	3147200	Aren't you worried that like part way into your scoring with a famous lady?
3147200	3149200	I'm assuming that's how it works.
3149200	3153200	Like you're going down on a famous woman in bed
3153200	3156200	and you just hear her going through her phone up above
3156200	3159200	because she's like, well, let's make sure he's famous enough.
3159200	3160200	Drew Carey.
3160200	3164200	And then she's like, what does a blue asterisk mean?
3164200	3167200	And you're like, Gulp?
3167200	3169200	I'll be exposed, you're saying?
3169200	3171200	Yeah, I don't know.
3171200	3174200	I guess my metaphor is for like, you'll go on the date
3174200	3176200	and during the conversation, doesn't it circle the area of,
3176200	3178200	so how are you famous?
3178200	3180200	But then you'll say, fucking Rick and Morty.
3180200	3182200	Famous people would never say that to each other.
3182200	3186200	They'd just probably think, oh, you're like B.S.S. or something.
3186200	3189200	Ryan, did you go on dates with famous people?
3189200	3194200	Did you go, oh, shit, I'm with the girl from Full House.
3194200	3200200	Oh, shit, he thought too long.
3200200	3201200	I have not.
3201200	3202200	Every day is just you.
3202200	3203200	Just give initials.
3203200	3206200	I have not been on one date.
3206200	3207200	Fuck that.
3207200	3209200	Thank you, thank you.
3209200	3210200	That's terrible.
3210200	3211200	He's trying to cheat.
3211200	3213200	That's awful.
3213200	3215200	Do they have angled swipes on Rio where you can like,
3215200	3218200	you're swiping this way because they're not famous?
3218200	3221200	You're like, they're hot, but they're not famous.
3221200	3223200	They're famous, but they're ugly.
3223200	3226200	It's like upper left, upper lower right.
3226200	3227200	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3227200	3230200	It's called RIA?
3230200	3231200	RIA.
3231200	3232200	RIA.
3232200	3233200	Oh, okay.
3233200	3234200	Because it kind of is like diarrhea.
3234200	3235200	Okay, go ahead.
3235200	3236200	Or gonorrhea.
3236200	3238200	R-A-Y-A.
3238200	3240200	I dated Eve Plum when I first came out here.
3240200	3241200	You know what Eve Plum is?
3241200	3243200	She was the middle child on the Brady Bunch.
3243200	3244200	Oh, right.
3244200	3248200	And I almost pathologically did not bring up the Brady Bunch.
3248200	3249200	Right.
3249200	3251200	Just like everything else I could think of to talk about.
3251200	3254200	And then at one point, and we were at a place called Coyote,
3254200	3257200	which is now, I forget what it's called now, but anyway,
3257200	3260200	she, I was talking to her and then she said,
3260200	3261200	I'm going to use the restroom.
3261200	3266200	And as she walked away, I realized, I just said, Jan.
3266200	3269200	I think I said, do you know where the restroom is, Jan?
3269200	3271200	And she said, yeah, I'm fine.
3271200	3274200	I was like, oh, Jesus Christ.
3274200	3275200	Did you, did you?
3275200	3277200	I never found out for sure.
3277200	3279200	But then I thought it would be funny to just be like,
3279200	3280200	well, your dad's an architect.
3280200	3282200	Let me ask you a question.
3282200	3285200	I was completely confused.
3285200	3287200	Just make it like a syndrome.
3287200	3290200	But it just was, you don't want to go out with a famous person.
3290200	3292200	It's just like a ghost hanging on you.
3292200	3297200	How Eve was her plum.
3297200	3300200	You'd be surprised at how ineffective a line like that is
3300200	3302200	with someone like Eve Plum.
3302200	3303200	Or an audience.
3303200	3304200	So savvy.
3304200	3305200	And she sees that stuff coming.
3305200	3306200	She swats it down.
3306200	3307200	She just really...
3307200	3310200	Without having the technology of Raya,
3310200	3313200	how does one like us meet a famous woman?
3313200	3314200	How did you do it?
3314200	3315200	Yeah, you guys are on the same level.
3315200	3317200	I mean, I would guess I would call her for you.
3317200	3320200	He was at my level when he dated Eve Plum.
3320200	3321200	That's what I'm trying to...
3321200	3322200	All right, yeah, true.
3322200	3323200	I mean, I'll call her.
3323200	3324200	She's 60.
3324200	3326200	I mean, but I'll call her for you if you want to...
3326200	3328200	How did you meet her?
3329200	3331200	A friend of mine said, hey, I'm friends with Eve Plum.
3331200	3333200	And I said, Jan from The Brady Bunch?
3333200	3335200	Yeah, and he said, do you want to go out with her?
3335200	3336200	And I did.
3336200	3337200	You know, it's like...
3337200	3340200	And actually, I felt really bad about it.
3340200	3341200	So you have that to look forward to.
3341200	3342200	But I did.
3342200	3344200	I mean, I really was like...
3344200	3346200	She was kind of interested, I think,
3346200	3348200	and I just was aware that like,
3348200	3351200	I'm into this for all the wrong reasons.
3351200	3354200	Ryan did this, so someday I can be on, you know,
3354200	3356200	a primetime television show, talk show,
3356200	3357200	with some famous...
3357200	3360200	Anyway, I thought I'd tell it, you know, on Johnny Carson.
3360200	3362200	But everybody in some way, it's funny, I...
3362200	3364200	Didn't pan out.
3364200	3365200	Ryan, how...
3365200	3368200	I dribbled out 20 years, 30 years later.
3368200	3369200	When you were...
3369200	3370200	When Dan Harmon...
3370200	3371200	When you got on...
3371200	3373200	When you were like calling up like customer service
3373200	3376200	and going, I demand to be on this thing.
3376200	3378200	I demand, I demand...
3378200	3379200	Stop locking up your women.
3379200	3380200	Stop it.
3380200	3381200	Yeah.
3381200	3382200	I know they're in there.
3382200	3383200	I deserve one.
3383200	3385200	What is your dream like?
3385200	3388200	Stop letting Scott Cahn date everybody on your site.
3388200	3390200	I'm not gonna deny that any of this was in my head.
3390200	3391200	This is all...
3391200	3394200	What woman were you hoping...
3394200	3396200	Give me a name or something like that.
3396200	3397200	Give us like your...
3397200	3398200	Alyssa Milano.
3398200	3399200	I don't know.
3399200	3400200	Like what?
3400200	3401200	Oh, God, it was Alyssa Milano.
3401200	3402200	It wasn't.
3402200	3403200	Look at him.
3403200	3405200	Oh, my God.
3405200	3407200	I didn't have anyone in mind,
3407200	3410200	but as I swiped through, I was like,
3410200	3412200	Whoa, her, from that one gang.
3412200	3414200	Wait, they advertised them before you get on?
3414200	3418200	It's like, would you like to date Alice in Hannigan?
3418200	3420200	Yes, I would.
3420200	3422200	That'll be $5 and proof of fame, please.
3422200	3426200	You can preview her,
3426200	3430200	but you can't have a fulfilling relationship with her.
3430200	3433200	You must have had some kind of scenario.
3433200	3435200	Well, you weren't picturing Dame Judi Dench.
3435200	3436200	Come on.
3436200	3437200	You had something in your mind.
3437200	3438200	Yeah, yeah.
3438200	3441200	Something in general, you know, age range.
3441200	3442200	Who's your...
3442200	3443200	Who's your...
3443200	3444200	Some proportion.
3444200	3446200	Maybe somebody in trauma, not comedy.
3446200	3449200	But also somebody so famous enough to be on the site,
3449200	3452200	good looking enough for you to be attracted to her,
3452200	3454200	but also on a dating site.
3454200	3455200	Damaged enough.
3455200	3456200	For famous people.
3456200	3457200	Because the phrase you're looking for, damaged enough.
3457200	3458200	Damaged.
3458200	3459200	Oh, am I damaged?
3459200	3460200	I don't know.
3460200	3461200	It's the fame part of it.
3461200	3464200	Maybe she's just been hurt too many times
3464200	3465200	and she wants to fucking try new things.
3465200	3467200	I'm not going to mess around this time.
3467200	3470200	I just want somebody famous and then...
3470200	3472200	You know, I can't be hurt again.
3472200	3474200	If I could just get...
3474200	3477200	Just an ex-teen star or something.
3477200	3480200	Maybe a drummer is going through rehab.
3480200	3481200	Somebody, you know...
3481200	3482200	You haven't been too shallow.
3482200	3484200	Adult Swim writer famous.
3484200	3486200	That's what I want.
3486200	3488200	Just that level.
3490200	3493200	He got me right where it hurts.
3493200	3496200	Now, is it true, Ryan, I heard this from somebody,
3496200	3500200	that dating apps, like, you have to be...
3500200	3503200	I think I heard this on S-town.
3503200	3505200	S... whatever it's called?
3505200	3506200	Yeah.
3506200	3508200	Yeah, we could call it shit-down.
3508200	3510200	Yeah, we could call it whatever we want.
3510200	3512200	I just couldn't remember if it was S-City or...
3512200	3515200	It's another podcast that's ripping us off.
3515200	3517200	No, but I think it might have...
3517200	3519200	Another podcast where 11 guys get drunk
3519200	3521200	and just jabber for two hours?
3523200	3525200	It's not far from that, but if one of us
3525200	3528200	would... but anyways...
3528200	3530200	The idea is that you can't...
3530200	3534200	For the duration that most people are single,
3534200	3536200	it doesn't...
3536200	3539200	It's sort of like gym membership in that they're kind of...
3539200	3543200	If you only sign up for dating services,
3543200	3546200	whatever you want to call them,
3546200	3548200	for the amount of time that you're single,
3548200	3551200	and then you immediately pull out of them
3551200	3553200	as soon as you have a thing happening
3553200	3555200	that makes you, oh, I don't need this anymore,
3555200	3558200	and then reinvest...
3558200	3560200	Just the time...
3560200	3563200	It makes you permanently ineffective in those zones
3563200	3566200	that it's like people are thinking about that way now.
3566200	3568200	They're thinking, I don't want to pay the membership fees again.
3568200	3570200	But it's also sort of like rhythmically,
3570200	3572200	you'll never, ever quite...
3572200	3574200	You'll circle the drain forever without going in it,
3574200	3577200	I guess in this metaphor, going into a drain is good.
3577200	3578200	It's a beautiful...
3578200	3581200	At some point, you have to shit or get off the pot,
3581200	3584200	and that's a beautiful sentiment to really moving forward.
3584200	3586200	I'm ready to take that shit.
3586200	3590200	No, I think the tragic thing is that you can't...
3590200	3593200	I think kids today are encountering the fact that
3593200	3598200	they can't shut down all of their electronic tendrils
3598200	3600200	just because they got into a meaningful relationship
3600200	3604200	because it's almost like this worse thing than even a prenup
3604200	3607200	where it's like you have to admit to yourself and the world that,
3607200	3610200	well, but I have my...
3610200	3612200	I still have this pool of...
3612200	3613200	I still have the skin box.
3613200	3616200	When most people stop dating, they get serious in a relationship.
3616200	3619200	They're really giving up two other opportunities.
3619200	3620200	You know what I mean?
3620200	3623200	There's that other woman at work, but she's married.
3623200	3626200	Oh, and then there's the woman who brings us the lunch.
3626200	3630200	And it's like, no, this is the one.
3630200	3632200	Here's what I'm saying.
3632200	3636200	I'm saying that we went from,
3636200	3641200	oh, you have to be in a bar and run into somebody physically.
3641200	3644200	Wherever computer dating started and we were all like,
3644200	3647200	wow, computers playing matchmaker.
3647200	3652200	Now, these kids, it's almost weirder when you run into a couple that met
3652200	3654200	in a library or a bar or something like that.
3654200	3658200	It's more common that, oh, the name of an app comes out of their mouth.
3658200	3660200	How did you meet?
3660200	3663200	But I'm wondering if it's all good
3663200	3666200	or if it's the darkness part of it.
3666200	3670200	Or maybe it's a good thing for sex and sexuality to be demystified
3670200	3674200	and monogamy that it's like, well, hey, I got a little barbershop open.
3674200	3677200	It's like, yes, you're my favorite customer.
3677200	3678200	Place is still open.
3678200	3683200	I tell everybody it's going to be three hours.
3683200	3685200	But that three hours could be a year.
3685200	3686200	You know what I mean?
3686200	3691200	We're coming from a world where it would be offensive for the place to be open,
3691200	3693200	but we have to now break it into...
3693200	3695200	These kids have to break things into waiting rooms.
3695200	3696200	They have to...
3696200	3699200	Because if they pull out of Tinder Toombler or whatever,
3699200	3702200	they get back into it and they'll find...
3702200	3703200	Because it...
3706200	3707200	It's 9-11.
3711200	3716200	Our crowd is full of terrorists.
3716200	3722200	They were celebrating.
3722200	3724200	They were celebrating.
3724200	3726200	Yeah, this was that mosque.
3726200	3728200	This was the mosque that was celebrating.
3728200	3733200	I mean, Mitch, you must be part of about the World Trade Towers going down.
3733200	3734200	That's what they're called.
3734200	3735200	Hey, Ryan.
3735200	3736200	Ryan.
3736200	3737200	Ryan.
3737200	3738200	Yo.
3738200	3739200	What's this sexy...
3739200	3741200	He doesn't know what they're called.
3741200	3745200	Well, I knew one of them was called, but I just couldn't remember the other.
3745200	3746200	Right.
3746200	3750200	You forgot that there was a centralization of two things.
3750200	3751200	All right.
3751200	3754200	Do you guys want to just take one look at...
3754200	3755200	You know who Dustin Marshall is?
3755200	3756200	He's a producer.
3756200	3757200	Fairly audio.
3757200	3759200	You know how you always make fun...
3759200	3762200	We're dressed like Beetlejuice and he's all black.
3762200	3764200	He's got a little black music cap.
3764200	3765200	Apparently...
3765200	3769200	I guess he defeated the Balrog or got defeated by one.
3769200	3771200	So now he's...
3771200	3772200	He leveled up, I think.
3772200	3773200	He's leveled up.
3773200	3774200	Because he used to...
3774200	3776200	I mean, he notoriously...
3776200	3779200	The only thing white he ever wore was the headphones that he would always have on.
3779200	3780200	Right.
3780200	3783200	But now he's dressed like a hotel room couch.
3783200	3784200	Is he back there now?
3784200	3786200	Dustin Marshall!
3786200	3787200	No.
3787200	3788200	Show yourself.
3788200	3789200	He's gone.
3789200	3790200	He disappeared.
3790200	3791200	Dustin Marshall is not back there.
3791200	3793200	Oh, here he comes!
3797200	3798200	Yes!
3798200	3799200	Stan, get up.
3799200	3800200	No, no.
3800200	3801200	You don't have to...
3801200	3802200	We just want to look at him.
3802200	3803200	He doesn't need to...
3803200	3804200	He can...
3804200	3806200	Well, he can promote some fair audio things.
3806200	3808200	Hey!
3810200	3812200	So it's our last show at Meltdown.
3812200	3813200	It's like half a decade.
3813200	3814200	Thank you.
3814200	3817200	You look like you might be able to sell me some really good Molly.
3818200	3820200	I can find you some.
3821200	3824200	We have a show, like, kind of living the dream,
3824200	3827200	because we are always talking about starting our own space.
3827200	3830200	And we started a live streaming company with...
3830200	3832200	our friends Kevin Day and Chris Borif.
3832200	3833200	Yeah.
3833200	3837200	They made this, like, state-of-the-art live streaming service for us.
3837200	3838200	We own everything.
3838200	3841200	But we have a show next Friday.
3841200	3843200	There's two shows next Friday at our new venue.
3843200	3847200	Duncan Trussell's doing a stand-up show Thursday.
3847200	3850200	And then Peril Audio and the Be Here Now Network,
3850200	3852200	which is, like, Rhomdos' people.
3852200	3854200	We're putting on a special show where it's like...
3854200	3856200	Rhomdos ain't no joke!
3861200	3862200	Whoo!
3869200	3871200	That microphone was my reaction.
3872200	3875200	Rhomdos ain't no joke!
3877200	3878200	But it's...
3879200	3881200	Rhomdos ain't no joke!
3886200	3888200	I don't think this is even over.
3891200	3892200	Oh, shit.
3898200	3901200	The jury's still like, is Rhomdos a joke or not a joke?
3903200	3905200	Rhomdos ain't no joke!
3908200	3910200	First rule of improv is, you know, be here now.
3910200	3911200	Mike is not a joke.
3911200	3912200	It's gonna be funny.
3912200	3913200	It's gonna be funny.
3913200	3914200	But, you know...
3914200	3916200	He ain't no joke, though.
3916200	3918200	Duncan Trussell and I, like, years ago...
3918200	3920200	Duncan Trussell is very, like...
3920200	3921200	Even before I moved here, you know,
3921200	3923200	he was very informative getting me into, like,
3923200	3924200	Alan Watts and Rhomdos.
3924200	3926200	And we're really trying to, like...
3926200	3928200	The spiritual community are so cool.
3928200	3929200	They're like, holy shit.
3929200	3931200	So we're putting on a show at this awesome venue,
3931200	3933200	Starburn's Castle.
3933200	3935200	It'll be Duncan Trussell,
3935200	3937200	Kate Verlant and Chelsea Peretti,
3937200	3939200	talking to Sharon Salzberg
3939200	3941200	and a bunch of people from the Rhomdos community.
3941200	3943200	So definitely get tickets now.
3943200	3945200	There's a bunch of surprises lined up.
3945200	3949200	As I'm led to believe, this new show is no joke.
3949200	3950200	It is no joke.
3950200	3953200	Rhomdos is no fucking joke.
3953200	3955200	But, yes, thank you, Dan.
3955200	3956200	All right, Dustin the...
3956200	3957200	Thank you, everybody.
3957200	3958200	Dustin the White.
3958200	3960200	Dustin Marsil!
3960200	3962200	Feralaudio.com.
3962200	3965200	Go to Feralaudio.com.
3965200	3968200	Follow your heart.
3968200	3969200	Damn!
3969200	3970200	Dustin's...
3970200	3973200	Dustin's trainer's a white!
3974200	3975200	Got some white trainers.
3975200	3976200	Yeah.
3976200	3977200	It's all clean.
3977200	3978200	He's not wearing those piss wipers.
3978200	3979200	When I was a kid on the playground,
3979200	3980200	did they call them piss wipers, Brandon,
3980200	3983200	when you were on the grade school playground?
3983200	3984200	Uh, no.
3984200	3985200	Yeah.
3985200	3988200	It was like, when the 80s crazed...
3988200	3989200	What's a piss wiper?
3989200	3990200	Yeah.
3990200	3991200	You were supposed to wear, like,
3991200	3992200	Air Jordans and stuff.
3992200	3995200	If you had regular Chuck Taylors,
3995200	3997200	particularly, like, the white canvas ones,
3997200	3998200	those were called piss wipers
3998200	4000200	because they would turn kind of yellow over time.
4000200	4001200	Uh-huh.
4001200	4002200	Pissed on them?
4002200	4003200	Yeah.
4003200	4004200	I'd never heard that.
4004200	4007200	Don't look at me like you hate me.
4009200	4012200	Look at me with...
4012200	4014200	Look at him like you want to go over to his place
4014200	4016200	and watch Grudge.
4016200	4019200	Do you guys know that dating app, Piss Swipers?
4019200	4021200	Are you saying it from one pisser?
4021200	4022200	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
4022200	4025200	I found out I'm actually too famous to get on piss wipers.
4025200	4026200	Yeah.
4026200	4027200	No famies.
4027200	4029200	No famies.
4029200	4030200	Hey, Ryan.
4030200	4031200	Yo.
4031200	4034200	What's the sexiest date you've ever been on?
4034200	4036200	Ooh.
4036200	4039200	Music, music, music, music.
4039200	4040200	Here we go.
4040200	4041200	Walk us through it.
4041200	4042200	Walk us through it.
4042200	4043200	I don't want to do this.
4043200	4044200	Hang on.
4044200	4045200	You know, you don't have to give names.
4045200	4049200	I'm not comfortable with my sexuality enough to describe this.
4049200	4050200	I'm uptight.
4050200	4051200	Well, tell...
4051200	4052200	Wait, I got one.
4052200	4053200	Okay.
4053200	4054200	Okay, here we go.
4054200	4055200	No, no, no, no.
4055200	4056200	I don't got one.
4056200	4059200	I mean, tell us the sexiest date in your mind
4059200	4060200	what you'd like your fantasy date.
4060200	4061200	Oh, yeah.
4061200	4062200	That's what I meant.
4062200	4063200	The perfect date for Ryan Ridley
4063200	4065200	for those ladies who want to become famous
4065200	4067200	so that they have access to him.
4067200	4068200	Here we go.
4068200	4069200	We now take it here.
4069200	4070200	This will incentivize.
4070200	4071200	Sometimes the ladies are like,
4071200	4072200	why would I even want to be famous?
4072200	4076200	I already have too much attention from a horrible culture of men.
4076200	4077200	Get ready for it.
4077200	4080200	Why not just sit here and be nervous
4080200	4081200	every time there's a knock at the door?
4081200	4082200	I'll tell you why.
4082200	4083200	Why you should get out there.
4083200	4087200	You might get famous, then you can date this guy.
4087200	4089200	That's a little piss-wiper.
4089200	4092200	So here's your description of the perfect date.
4092200	4093200	Perfect date.
4093200	4098200	Can I get a location from the audience?
4098200	4101200	All right.
4101200	4104200	So, the standard.
4104200	4105200	All right.
4105200	4106200	All right.
4106200	4107200	The standard.
4107200	4109200	Wait, wait.
4109200	4113200	The standard, but it's upside down.
4113200	4115200	The standard.
4116200	4118200	The standard.
4118200	4119200	Okay.
4119200	4121200	We now take you to a date with Ryan Ridley at a hotel
4121200	4125200	where they're so cool they write their name upside down.
4125200	4131200	It's the standard.
4131200	4135200	Can I get a famous woman from the audience?
4135200	4137200	Clearly not.
4137200	4138200	I thought you were going to...
4138200	4139200	Marlo Thomas.
4139200	4141200	The girl from the ring.
4141200	4143200	Marlo Thomas?
4143200	4144200	Did you say Marlo Thomas?
4144200	4145200	Yes, I did.
4145200	4146200	All right.
4146200	4149200	Ryan, you have to pick for our purposes.
4149200	4150200	You have to pick.
4150200	4151200	You didn't even pick the place.
4151200	4152200	You got to pick the...
4152200	4153200	I'm not going to...
4153200	4154200	I can't.
4154200	4156200	I'm not a good improviser.
4156200	4157200	Goddamn.
4157200	4159200	I got my system.
4159200	4161200	Pick a man.
4161200	4162200	Pick a place.
4162200	4164200	Pick a place and pick a lady.
4164200	4167200	Pick an actress that you may or may not have fantasized about before.
4167200	4168200	How about one of the women?
4168200	4170200	I haven't seen it, but one of the women from Hidden Figures.
4170200	4171200	Oh.
4171200	4172200	Would that be...
4172200	4173200	The one in the wheelchair?
4173200	4174200	Wrong kind of fame?
4174200	4175200	The one in the wheelchair?
4175200	4176200	Wrong kind of fame?
4176200	4177200	No.
4177200	4178200	Let me tell you something.
4178200	4180200	Because what I know, there are very, very impressive women.
4180200	4181200	Absolutely.
4181200	4183200	And they've served taking a back seat in many ways.
4183200	4185200	You should be so lucky.
4185200	4186200	How about that?
4186200	4187200	Yeah, you should be so lucky.
4187200	4189200	I haven't seen it, but it sounds like they're really special.
4189200	4191200	Yeah, you should be so lucky.
4191200	4193200	How about that woman that hangs out with Dog the Bounty Hunter?
4193200	4194200	How about her?
4194200	4196200	First of all, was she a hidden figure?
4196200	4198200	Was she hidden in something?
4198200	4201200	I just want to say, you don't have to do improv.
4201200	4204200	I wasn't asking you to reenact the thing with a famous...
4204200	4209200	I'm saying, in your mind, when things were going perfectly,
4209200	4212200	what would happen from the moment you start getting dressed?
4212200	4213200	Bitch.
4213200	4215200	And you're putting on your favorite belt?
4215200	4216200	I don't have to try for a laugh.
4216200	4218200	You're saying, you're giving me permission to just be earnest.
4218200	4220200	It's going to be funny if you're earnest.
4220200	4221200	No, no.
4221200	4223200	It's what I've learned.
4223200	4225200	It's not my prediction for you.
4225200	4227200	It's what I've learned.
4227200	4230200	Why am I a joke to you?
4230200	4233200	Everyone's a joke to everyone.
4233200	4235200	If you're, I'm saying, the royal you.
4235200	4237200	If you're earnest, it's going to be funny.
4237200	4238200	Yes.
4238200	4239200	You know that.
4239200	4240200	You know what I'm talking about.
4240200	4241200	All right.
4241200	4242200	So, Ryan.
4242200	4245200	What would you really, like, as a guy, now you're in the scene.
4245200	4247200	Like, all I can think about is getting home to Cody.
4247200	4250200	It's a very specific thing, because now I'm in it.
4250200	4253200	I'm in it, and I'm like, I'm in the chrysalis,
4253200	4255200	as my therapist calls it.
4255200	4258200	I just want to go home and watch Fofie, and it's forensic files.
4258200	4262200	We don't have time.
4262200	4265200	I just lost my boner for 1,000 juries.
4265200	4268200	Fofie.
4268200	4273200	That's how hillbillies refer to the president.
4273200	4276200	We're going to kick it to now with Fofie.
4276200	4281200	Whoo!
4281200	4283200	I want to hear about this magical date.
4283200	4287200	I just like to take a lady out and have a nice conversation over a drink, man.
4288200	4291200	Well, go slower and start at the beginning.
4291200	4293200	It's 7.30 p.m.
4293200	4294200	They're putting on your belt.
4294200	4296200	And Zach McKeever has a sexy beat for us up there.
4296200	4297200	Do the belt.
4297200	4300200	Zach, put a beat on before you get peed on.
4300200	4301200	Huh?
4301200	4303200	Who said that?
4303200	4305200	Thank you, Adam.
4305200	4308200	Adam, if anything, I feel closer in status to you
4308200	4311200	than I did anybody else up here.
4311200	4312200	Look what you did.
4312200	4313200	You're not on a date with Adam.
4313200	4316200	You're on a date with a sexy lady.
4316200	4317200	All right, you're putting on your belt.
4317200	4318200	You're putting on my belt.
4318200	4320200	I mean, my belt apparently ought to be on at 7.30 p.m.
4320200	4321200	I've been wearing it all day, but...
4321200	4322200	You're doing great.
4322200	4323200	Keep it up.
4323200	4324200	I would...
4324200	4326200	I'd probably put on fresh deodorant.
4326200	4327200	Great.
4327200	4328200	Uh...
4328200	4329200	Wash my face.
4329200	4331200	Put on fresh moisturizer.
4331200	4332200	Your belt's already on and you're...
4332200	4333200	It's 7.30 p.m.
4333200	4336200	I've been at work all day, and I came home, and I, you know, barely,
4336200	4340200	because, you know, you kept us right until about 7.
4340200	4343200	So...
4343200	4346200	It's part of your fantasy.
4346200	4348200	I could've gotten hit by a train.
4348200	4351200	It doesn't...
4351200	4352200	But maybe that's...
4352200	4354200	In this fantasy, there's a season four.
4354200	4357200	That's the biggest part of this fantasy.
4357200	4358200	Yeah.
4358200	4359200	Yeah.
4359200	4360200	Coming in 2020.
4360200	4362200	And I could take a woman on a date again.
4362200	4363200	All right.
4363200	4365200	My brother just came back.
4365200	4366200	I've said to you...
4366200	4368200	I said at 6 p.m., I said,
4368200	4371200	usually we work longer than this,
4371200	4373200	but Ryan did such a good job today.
4373200	4374200	Uh-huh.
4374200	4377200	Ryan has checked Marlow Thomas' IMDb page 12 times today.
4377200	4378200	He's excited.
4378200	4379200	Let's get him out of here.
4379200	4380200	Let's all go home.
4380200	4382200	There's nothing left to do because of Ryan.
4382200	4385200	And then you skip home on a cloud of lightning.
4385200	4387200	Okay.
4387200	4389200	Yeah, and so I already said I put on fresh deodorant.
4389200	4392200	You know, I'll probably change into my nice shirt.
4392200	4393200	Robocop.
4393200	4396200	Because...
4396200	4397200	The ideal date...
4397200	4398200	Low-hanging fruit, Rob.
4398200	4400200	Low-hanging fruit.
4400200	4401200	Hey.
4401200	4402200	Hey.
4402200	4404200	I'll go for whatever fruit I can get.
4404200	4406200	Are you going to pick her up, or is she coming?
4406200	4407200	Are you going to meet her somewhere?
4407200	4409200	You know, traditionally on a first date,
4409200	4410200	you meet someone at a location.
4410200	4411200	What's your fancy?
4411200	4412200	Either secret distance...
4412200	4413200	Oh.
4413200	4414200	Then in my neighborhood.
4414200	4415200	She's coming to you.
4415200	4416200	Yeah.
4416200	4417200	Is she coming to your door?
4417200	4418200	Even if she doesn't call her city, then, yeah.
4418200	4419200	Is she coming to your door?
4419200	4420200	Uh...
4420200	4421200	Do you want to meet her?
4421200	4422200	No, no, no.
4422200	4423200	That's creepy.
4423200	4424200	On a first date, that's way creepy, dude.
4424200	4425200	Neutral territory.
4425200	4426200	Where do you want to be there?
4426200	4427200	You want the woman to feel safe?
4427200	4428200	Are you wearing me on these right now or not?
4428200	4429200	Absolutely.
4429200	4430200	That's all I wear, bro.
4430200	4431200	100%.
4431200	4432200	Okay.
4432200	4433200	100%.
4433200	4434200	Where do you want to meet her?
4434200	4435200	Free commercial.
4435200	4436200	You know, a nice bar restaurant.
4436200	4437200	Are you saying be specific?
4437200	4438200	Yeah, be specific.
4438200	4440200	What am I getting the Jesus Christ from this guy for?
4440200	4441200	I don't know.
4441200	4442200	Let's get this guy up here.
4442200	4443200	No, no.
4443200	4444200	He's Jesus Christing me.
4444200	4445200	He's right.
4445200	4446200	No.
4446200	4449200	You don't have to worry about that.
4449200	4450200	You're on a fantasy date.
4450200	4451200	This is your date.
4451200	4452200	This is your date, right?
4452200	4453200	Where do you want to meet her?
4453200	4454200	This lack of math is upsetting.
4454200	4457200	You can make a new place up that doesn't exist.
4457200	4461200	Everybody talk at the same time.
4461200	4463200	Even the audience.
4463200	4465200	Studio 54.
4465200	4466200	Wow.
4466200	4467200	Thank you.
4467200	4469200	Ah, freak out!
4469200	4470200	All right.
4470200	4473200	Welcome to 1985.
4473200	4474200	Is it Liza Minnelli?
4474200	4478200	Because as a little boy growing up in the 80s, I knew that was the place where people
4478200	4480200	got laid in public.
4480200	4481200	Okay.
4481200	4482200	All right.
4482200	4483200	So you're...
4483200	4484200	Okay.
4484200	4485200	Is that your fantasy?
4485200	4486200	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
4486200	4487200	Excuse me.
4487200	4488200	Excuse me.
4488200	4489200	Excuse me.
4489200	4490200	Hey.
4490200	4491200	Only famous people could come into Studio 54.
4491200	4492200	How famous?
4492200	4495200	Let me see your credentials, sir.
4495200	4497200	Hey, you don't have to take that.
4497200	4498200	Excuse me, sir.
4498200	4499200	I'm from Variety.
4499200	4500200	Okay.
4500200	4503200	My camera just broke from his fame.
4503200	4505200	Well, excuse me.
4505200	4509200	Allow me to take the velvet rope off of there and you can come right in, sir.
4509200	4510200	I don't like this.
4510200	4511200	Come in, sir.
4511200	4512200	Sir?
4512200	4513200	You're coming in.
4513200	4514200	Come in now.
4514200	4515200	You're in.
4515200	4516200	Get in here now.
4516200	4517200	Thank you for letting me take your picture.
4517200	4518200	I'm sorry.
4518200	4519200	My camera wasn't going to know.
4519200	4525200	Sir, here's your complimentary mirror and Coke straw.
4525200	4529200	Enjoy yourself tonight.
4529200	4530200	It's good for you.
4530200	4531200	Cocaine.
4531200	4532200	80s.
4532200	4533200	Hello, sir.
4533200	4537200	In accordance with new house rules, you have been presented with an additional mirror,
4537200	4541200	one that won't have so much Coke on it, that you can't see yourself.
4541200	4543200	What's wrong with my mirror?
4543200	4548200	The manager suggested we give them two mirrors from now on, Stephanie.
4548200	4550200	Oh, that makes sense.
4550200	4551200	That makes sense.
4551200	4552200	I'll go back to my business.
4552200	4553200	I'm sorry.
4553200	4556200	No, Stephanie, I wasn't coming down on you.
4556200	4558200	But your attitude was a little bit...
4558200	4559200	I was...
4559200	4560200	We'll talk about this later in the car at home.
4560200	4561200	Sight bars.
4561200	4562200	We'll talk about it later.
4562200	4565200	Please, Ryan, just do some Coke and fuck somebody.
4565200	4567200	It's such a typical night.
4567200	4569200	Typical night at the 54.
4569200	4571200	That shit like this goes down all the time.
4571200	4575200	I'm sorry to interrupt you on your date, but I am a cocaine dealer,
4575200	4578200	and I deal only in mirrorless Coke.
4584200	4585200	Like red Coke?
4585200	4587200	What does that mean?
4587200	4590200	And I just vanish into a puff of smoke.
4592200	4597200	And then where I was standing, there's just a mirror laying there.
4597200	4598200	Ryan.
4598200	4599200	Ryan.
4599200	4600200	Hey, Ryan, it's me.
4600200	4603200	You're reflection in the mirror.
4604200	4606200	This is too many make-em-up hijinks.
4606200	4607200	I can handle it.
4607200	4609200	I don't know why I'm going into this.
4609200	4610200	Ryan, hey, it's me.
4610200	4612200	You're reflection.
4612200	4615200	Why are you sitting on a sideline?
4615200	4617200	You're all too funny with your improbability.
4617200	4619200	Ryan, it's just me, Ryan.
4619200	4620200	I can't get into this.
4620200	4622200	Just focus on your reflection.
4622200	4623200	Okay.
4623200	4625200	Sir, Ryan, Mr. Ridley, would you like me to have this...
4625200	4626200	Jesus Christ.
4626200	4627200	I had no time.
4627200	4628200	Would you like me to have this mirror removed?
4628200	4629200	Does this mirror bother you?
4629200	4631200	Are you afraid to look in your own reflection, sir?
4631200	4633200	I'll have this mirror removed if you like.
4633200	4634200	Hi.
4637200	4638200	You must be Ryan.
4640200	4641200	I like this.
4644200	4646200	That's when it gets good.
4646200	4647200	Yeah.
4648200	4649200	Hi.
4649200	4650200	Hi.
4650200	4651200	Andromeda?
4651200	4652200	Yes.
4654200	4655200	Andromeda, girl, we leaving.
4655200	4658200	You going to be okay to get home by yourself?
4658200	4659200	Yes, sir.
4659200	4661200	Thank you for bringing me here.
4661200	4662200	He looks okay to me.
4662200	4663200	Okay.
4664200	4667200	Come on, Andy Warhol and James Brown.
4669200	4670200	Ryan.
4670200	4671200	Ryan.
4671200	4672200	Ryan, it's me.
4672200	4673200	It's me.
4673200	4674200	You're reflection.
4674200	4675200	I'm still here.
4675200	4678200	I'm not going until I at least finish this bit here.
4682200	4683200	Talk to her.
4683200	4684200	Talk to her.
4684200	4685200	You look great.
4685200	4687200	Oh, thank you.
4688200	4693200	I know I'm not supposed to wear this type of clothing after this date.
4696200	4697200	Just placeholder.
4697200	4700200	Someone will do a pass that understands fashion.
4701200	4704200	A paparazzo walks by the camera and says,
4704200	4709200	oh, sorry, can I get a picture of Ryan Ridley and female Ed 209 from Robocop?
4709200	4710200	Ryan, get close.
4710200	4711200	Get closer.
4711200	4714200	I was picturing Twinkie from Buck Rogers.
4714200	4715200	Twinkie.
4715200	4716200	Twinkie.
4716200	4717200	Twinkie.
4717200	4718200	Twinkie.
4718200	4719200	Twinkie.
4719200	4720200	Twinkie.
4720200	4721200	Twinkie.
4721200	4722200	Twinkie.
4722200	4723200	Twinkie.
4723200	4724200	All right.
4724200	4729200	Twinkie is blowing earth, wind, and fire right now, so maybe there's someone else.
4729200	4730200	Hey, Ryan.
4730200	4731200	Hey, Ryan.
4731200	4732200	Ryan, this is your reflection.
4732200	4734200	I'm just going to go.
4734200	4735200	I'm just going to leave.
4735200	4736200	I'm just going to leave.
4736200	4737200	Goodbye.
4737200	4738200	Don't let your reflection leave.
4739200	4740200	Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?
4740200	4741200	Please.
4741200	4742200	Sit.
4742200	4743200	Please.
4743200	4750200	Do you mind if I cross and uncloss my spandex-covered legs?
4750200	4752200	I don't mind at all.
4752200	4757200	In fact, I don't want to say insist because that's gross,
4757200	4760200	but whatever makes you feel comfortable.
4760200	4762200	He's so down to earth.
4762200	4764200	Sorry.
4764200	4767200	I understand you're...
4767200	4768200	Down to earth.
4768200	4773200	He goes up to Mater D carrying Mick Jagger, walks by.
4773200	4775200	So down to earth.
4775200	4778200	Just walks out with him.
4778200	4780200	So tell me about yourself.
4780200	4781200	What's...
4781200	4782200	I mean, you know...
4782200	4785200	Everything.
4785200	4788200	You have to say what's to tell.
4788200	4789200	What's to tell.
4789200	4795200	What you see is what you get.
4795200	4796200	But you, how about you?
4796200	4797200	How is your drive?
4797200	4798200	How is your drive?
4798200	4799200	It was wonderful.
4799200	4804200	It's such a good question.
4804200	4807200	Let it go, Brandon.
4807200	4812200	I love driving.
4812200	4815200	I loved this drive.
4815200	4816200	Oh, wait.
4816200	4817200	Am I...
4817200	4818200	Oh.
4818200	4819200	Okay.
4819200	4820200	Sorry.
4820200	4821200	Tell me.
4821200	4825200	Not that that matters, but...
4825200	4829200	I love driving, and I came up sunset, but it was great.
4829200	4831200	Sounds very good.
4831200	4834200	How was your drive?
4834200	4836200	She took sunset all the way to New York City?
4836200	4838200	That's what I was going to say.
4838200	4841200	It really broke the reality for me when he said that.
4841200	4842200	It's a long drive.
4842200	4844200	I mean, that's a commitment.
4844200	4846200	That really means she must care about it.
4846200	4850200	This is your fantasy?
4850200	4852200	This is what you want to happen?
4852200	4854200	Listen, man, Spencer, I just go with the flow, man.
4854200	4856200	You've got to learn to do that sometimes.
4856200	4858200	Studio 54 is in New York?
4858200	4859200	Yes.
4859200	4861200	I thought I was in L.A.
4861200	4862200	No, no, it's not.
4862200	4863200	Sorry.
4863200	4865200	It's on 54th Street.
4865200	4867200	There's one of those in L.A.
4867200	4871200	I went there as a kid when I was like 10 or 11 because I was on a show,
4871200	4873200	and I looked back and I was like,
4873200	4877200	why did everybody keep putting their heads down on the table?
4877200	4879200	And I thought, oh, they're all like...
4879200	4880200	This is a weird thing.
4880200	4882200	People kept doing that, and that's what a disco nap is.
4882200	4884200	They were all just going down and snorting coke,
4884200	4886200	and that's also why everybody hated me
4886200	4889200	because I was a 10-year-old in a fucking club.
4889200	4891200	Let's just get back to the scene.
4891200	4892200	Well, maybe this...
4892200	4894200	This is a DVD commentary.
4894200	4896200	Let's get back to the scene here.
4896200	4898200	Also, fucking Ben Vereen was there,
4898200	4900200	and he fucking treated me like a piece of shit.
4900200	4902200	I'm glad he got hit by that car.
4902200	4905200	You got a lot of issues.
4905200	4907200	Do you know how to get to Malibu?
4907200	4911200	You take PCH and make a right when you hit Ben Vereen.
4911200	4913200	All right, okay, all right.
4913200	4915200	All right.
4915200	4917200	As a black man, I'll allow it.
4917200	4920200	Yes.
4920200	4922200	I hope it's okay.
4922200	4926200	I brought Jeff Davis.
4926200	4927200	Hey.
4927200	4928200	More than merrier.
4928200	4929200	Hey.
4929200	4930200	Hey, excuse me.
4930200	4932200	You want to dance, Miss?
4932200	4933200	No, Mark Wahlberg.
4933200	4935200	I don't.
4935200	4936200	Come on, come on.
4936200	4937200	Why don't you want to dance with me?
4937200	4938200	Come on.
4938200	4939200	I think you're a wonderful man,
4939200	4942200	but I'm with Ryan Ridley on a date.
4942200	4945200	It doesn't seem like he's talking to you much.
4945200	4946200	I mean...
4946200	4948200	I beg your pardon, but that's none of your business.
4948200	4949200	Oh, okay.
4949200	4952200	Well, you know, I'll dance with somebody else.
4952200	4955200	Hey, Spencer, do you want to dance with me?
4955200	4958200	I'm Jeremy Renner.
4958200	4959200	Hey.
4959200	4961200	You guys want some water?
4961200	4962200	Okay.
4962200	4963200	You guys need some water?
4963200	4964200	Hey, I like that call back.
4964200	4965200	Why don't you dance with me?
4965200	4966200	It's me, Jeremy Renner.
4966200	4967200	Hey.
4967200	4969200	There's so many famous people in here.
4969200	4972200	It's a very anachronistic version of Club 54, too, because he's...
4972200	4973200	Why would you say that?
4973200	4976200	Because you're staring at Charles Corralt.
4976200	4978200	Oh, shit.
4978200	4988200	Newsmen from the early 80s, who apparently no one remembers.
4988200	4990200	It's me, Charles Corralt.
4990200	4993200	I dare you to Google who that is.
4993200	4994200	High five.
4994200	4995200	High five.
4995200	4997200	It turned out to be a polygamist, right?
4997200	4999200	You're exactly right.
4999200	5006200	I'm so horny.
5006200	5007200	No.
5007200	5008200	Okay, no.
5008200	5011200	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5011200	5014200	Let's take it slow, Andromeda.
5014200	5016200	Let's get to know each other.
5016200	5024200	I'm so interested in your drive over here.
5024200	5026200	Let's talk about your drive.
5026200	5027200	We already did.
5027200	5029200	No, baby.
5029200	5030200	Are you a...
5030200	5034200	I would never say baby, yeah.
5034200	5037200	Are you a robot?
5037200	5043200	I am a robot.
5043200	5045200	Do you want me to be a robot?
5045200	5047200	Do you want me to be a robot?
5047200	5049200	I don't want you to be anything, Andromeda.
5049200	5050200	What are you?
5050200	5052200	I'm a robot.
5052200	5053200	Get high, baby.
5053200	5055200	Are you sure you're a robot?
5055200	5057200	I'm trying to feel you out.
5057200	5059200	This is your fantasy.
5059200	5061200	Do you want me to be a robot?
5061200	5063200	I think we're at a little bit of a standoff here.
5063200	5064200	It's last call.
5064200	5065200	It's 5.30 AM.
5065200	5067200	It's last call, everybody.
5067200	5069200	You don't have to stay here, but you...
5069200	5072200	I am a robot, and I'm tired of being one.
5072200	5075200	Sliced, stabbed, machine gun.
5075200	5076200	No feelings.
5076200	5077200	No government.
5077200	5078200	This is my fantasy.
5078200	5079200	I must fight my child.
5079200	5081200	This is my fantasy.
5081200	5084200	I'm Tandy Newton, and I'm going to kill everyone.
5084200	5086200	I can remember everything.
5086200	5088200	I can climb walls.
5088200	5089200	Yes.
5089200	5093200	I'm lowering my guilt index.
5093200	5096200	I can kick your head off.
5096200	5100200	I'm a crazy, runaway, sexy robot.
5100200	5103200	But I love Brian Ridley.
5103200	5104200	No.
5104200	5105200	No, I hate Brian Ridley.
5105200	5106200	No, you want to kill everybody.
5106200	5107200	I hate Brian Ridley.
5107200	5108200	Call everybody.
5108200	5110200	Must kill Brian Ridley.
5110200	5113200	Yo, I must kill Brian Ridley.
5113200	5114200	Wait.
5114200	5117200	I'm not rapping to this.
5117200	5120200	I got to kill Brian Ridley.
5120200	5121200	Okay, and then you come, or...
5121200	5123200	It's so romantic.
5123200	5124200	It's so romantic.
5124200	5128200	You want to get killed by a coke robot?
5128200	5132200	Man, if you don't get it, then...
5132200	5133200	He wants to...
5133200	5135200	Look, here's what I'm getting.
5135200	5136200	You want to react to stuff.
5136200	5140200	You need, like, a...
5140200	5142200	What do you call it?
5142200	5143200	What was it?
5143200	5144200	Madonna?
5144200	5147200	When the Griffin Dunn and the...
5147200	5148200	After Hours?
5148200	5149200	No, no.
5149200	5150200	The other thing.
5150200	5151200	Susan.
5151200	5153200	Susan seeking the...
5153200	5154200	That's really seeking Susan.
5154200	5155200	No, but...
5155200	5156200	That was the...
5156200	5157200	You need...
5157200	5159200	Yeah, you want like a manic pixie fucking thing.
5159200	5160200	What?
5160200	5161200	No.
5161200	5162200	Grow up, dude.
5162200	5165200	I want a woman who's intelligent, strong,
5165200	5166200	has her shit together.
5166200	5167200	The hidden figures.
5167200	5169200	No, I don't want to listen.
5169200	5170200	There's a...
5170200	5172200	I would love...
5172200	5174200	I would love to date a woman.
5174200	5175200	They're so strong.
5175200	5177200	The shit that they had to put up with, apparently.
5177200	5178200	Yeah.
5178200	5179200	This is your kind of lady.
5179200	5180200	Absolutely.
5180200	5181200	A NASA...
5181200	5182200	NASA?
5182200	5183200	Mathematician.
5183200	5184200	A nice piece of NASA.
5184200	5185200	Yeah, absolutely.
5185200	5187200	A nice piece of NASA.
5187200	5191200	Did you think that maybe you would find a more intelligent
5191200	5195200	and independent woman by seeking out women on this site?
5195200	5196200	Hey, listen.
5196200	5200200	You gotta cast a wide net, you know what I'm saying?
5200200	5204200	But this net seems sort of singular and elitist.
5204200	5205200	Just...
5205200	5207200	I'm just wondering.
5207200	5210200	You find love in the strangest places.
5210200	5211200	Right.
5211200	5212200	Okay.
5212200	5213200	Let's see.
5213200	5216200	If there's a riot for scientists, please let me know.
5216200	5218200	I'll sign up for that too.
5218200	5222200	It's called going out in the world where scientists live.
5222200	5224200	You should have gone to the...
5224200	5226200	You should have gone to the March for Science downtown.
5226200	5230200	It was mostly smart women down there.
5230200	5233200	Every university has a coffee shop.
5234200	5235200	All right.
5235200	5237200	Is there a scientist in the audience?
5237200	5238200	I did think about that, actually.
5238200	5239200	Huh?
5239200	5240200	I did think about that.
5240200	5241200	Trying to meet...
5241200	5243200	But that's a shitty reason to go march.
5243200	5245200	No, and you could volunteer for...
5245200	5247200	Are you telling me I shouldn't go to church to meet women?
5247200	5249200	Scientific tests.
5249200	5252200	You could do like a sleep apnea test.
5252200	5253200	You know, like a...
5253200	5254200	Something tells me...
5254200	5256200	You know, they're not just letting undergrads run those things.
5256200	5257200	There's some scientists in there.
5257200	5258200	Oh, really?
5258200	5259200	Oh, yeah.
5259200	5260200	Scientists have all night watching you sleep.
5260200	5261200	You could volunteer.
5261200	5264200	I mean, I probably PhDs, or they're getting their PhDs.
5264200	5265200	Uh-huh.
5265200	5266200	Do you want them to already have PhDs?
5266200	5270200	That's not the most exciting area of expertise, frankly.
5270200	5272200	You're more like NASA...
5272200	5273200	Yeah, cosmic.
5273200	5275200	Like someone who worked on the Land Rover.
5275200	5276200	You're angling for a...
5276200	5277200	The Land Rover.
5277200	5278200	The Mars Rover.
5278200	5279200	A hot...
5279200	5281200	I'll take someone who works at Land Rover, too.
5281200	5284200	Oh, because I was going to say, yeah, the guy that worked on my Land Rover has got a daughter.
5284200	5285200	Yeah.
5285200	5286200	I can't believe they put a Land Rover on Mars.
5286200	5289200	That was amazing.
5289200	5293200	Because you think that the English car companies wouldn't be able to afford that.
5293200	5295200	Steve Lewis!
5295200	5297200	Steve Lewis!
5297200	5302200	Hey, Steve, what do you think of the fact that everyone's making me a big joke up here?
5302200	5303200	Huh?
5303200	5305200	That pursuit of love is just a big joke to be mocked.
5305200	5307200	What do you think of that, Steve?
5307200	5309200	About love in general, or you?
5309200	5310200	Oh!
5310200	5311200	About that?
5311200	5313200	Everybody making a big joke about my pursuit of love.
5313200	5314200	What do you think about that?
5314200	5316200	I mean, I'm sorry.
5316200	5317200	Steve!
5317200	5318200	Hey, Steve!
5318200	5319200	Hey, Steve!
5319200	5320200	Hey, Rob!
5320200	5321200	Oh, shit!
5321200	5322200	Steve, do you date a lot?
5322200	5323200	Look who's here!
5323200	5324200	No.
5324200	5325200	Why not?
5325200	5326200	That guy likes me.
5326200	5327200	Hey, John Carmen, everybody!
5327200	5328200	Who's it?
5328200	5329200	Oh, sorry.
5329200	5331200	He's the Steve Levy of Justin Roiland.
5332200	5333200	I know, but it's...
5333200	5336200	All right, John Carmen, stand up here so that they can see the joke.
5336200	5337200	We'll get to my question later.
5337200	5339200	I don't date to answer your question.
5339200	5340200	Hold on.
5340200	5344200	Since Steve Levy gave me such a dissatisfying answer, John Carmen, what do you think about
5344200	5349200	all these jokers making a big old funny thing about my pursuit of love?
5349200	5351200	Use your own mic.
5351200	5354200	Look, Ryan, I'm in the same boat as you, so...
5354200	5360200	I was picturing myself in your position at Studio 54, and it was just...
5360200	5362200	You know, I would have done the same thing.
5362200	5366200	See, doesn't it seem like I got Levy and then Justin got synthetic Levy?
5366200	5368200	That's what I always call him.
5368200	5369200	You didn't even learn my name.
5369200	5370200	That's all you called me at work.
5370200	5371200	Synthetic Levy.
5375200	5376200	But you hung in there.
5376200	5378200	You didn't go like, synthetic Levy, I'm out of here!
5378200	5381200	You're like, okay, I guess that's my name.
5381200	5383200	He's Justin Roiland's assistant.
5383200	5386200	I'd say his skin is pretty thick, and his brain is pretty...
5386200	5387200	Thick.
5387200	5388200	Fortified?
5389200	5390200	Careful.
5390200	5392200	You would not believe the shit I was saying.
5392200	5394200	You're Justin Roiland's assistant?
5394200	5395200	I am.
5395200	5397200	Take us, like...
5400200	5402200	It's ten o'clock!
5402200	5405200	I have to get up in the morning, I have to go to a meeting.
5405200	5408200	What meeting am I supposed to go to?
5408200	5410200	What am I doing right now?
5410200	5413200	Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do.
5413200	5416200	I need some kind of Rubik's snake to put together.
5417200	5418200	What am I doing?
5418200	5419200	What am I doing?
5419200	5421200	Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do.
5421200	5424200	You have more information on those Nintendo sales.
5424200	5425200	What's going on?
5425200	5427200	I need more Nintendo products.
5427200	5428200	He needs a VR, this shit.
5428200	5429200	What the fuck is going...
5429200	5432200	What the fuck is going on with my life?
5432200	5435200	Which line are you standing in right now?
5435200	5437200	For the iPhone or the Nintendo?
5437200	5440200	Somebody walk all of my dogs.
5441200	5445200	Somebody needs to walk all of my 900 dogs.
5446200	5448200	Please, somebody walk my dogs.
5448200	5449200	Where are my dogs?
5449200	5451200	Somebody walk my dogs.
5451200	5452200	My dogs need to be walking.
5452200	5454200	My walking dogs.
5454200	5456200	Why aren't you walking my dogs, Marty?
5459200	5460200	Word for word.
5460200	5462200	I nearly had a stand in the overnight.
5462200	5464200	Who are you talking to?
5464200	5465200	Are you crazy?
5465200	5467200	Is there something wrong with you?
5467200	5469200	Are you fucking nuts right now?
5469200	5471200	Somebody help me.
5471200	5472200	I'm dying.
5473200	5475200	All right.
5475200	5476200	Is it noon yet?
5476200	5478200	Can we order lunch?
5482200	5484200	Justin loves lunch.
5484200	5487200	Rob, you have some weird PTSD about Justin Raylan.
5492200	5494200	Levy, just here.
5494200	5496200	I'm on a date with you.
5496200	5497200	Don't trust that money, Paul.
5497200	5499200	Dan's on a date with Steve Levy.
5499200	5501200	Oh my God, so fucking hot.
5501200	5502200	Do it, do it.
5502200	5503200	Oh, God.
5503200	5504200	Here we go.
5504200	5506200	I'm going to jerk off so hard on this.
5506200	5507200	Dude, dude, dude.
5507200	5508200	Frosted edges.
5508200	5509200	I'm a friend of mine.
5509200	5510200	Edges are frosted.
5510200	5511200	It's impossible.
5511200	5512200	Hi.
5512200	5513200	Are you leaving?
5513200	5514200	I am.
5514200	5516200	Or did you just get here?
5516200	5517200	He's all...
5519200	5521200	Just let it run.
5521200	5522200	Bam!
5522200	5523200	I'm sorry.
5523200	5524200	I'm going to shut up.
5524200	5525200	Please, please.
5525200	5526200	I'm going to shut up.
5526200	5527200	There's just too many.
5527200	5528200	Go ahead, please.
5528200	5529200	We love you, Rob.
5529200	5530200	Please go ahead.
5530200	5532200	Just keep continuing with the scene.
5532200	5533200	I'm sorry.
5533200	5534200	Just slowly a bit.
5534200	5537200	Steve's already well out performing Ryan at this point.
5537200	5538200	What?
5538200	5540200	Are you Steve Levy?
5540200	5541200	Yeah.
5541200	5546200	I was told by Toomba to meet you here.
5546200	5547200	I'm Andromeda.
5547200	5548200	I'm sorry, who?
5548200	5550200	Toomba, the app that we use.
5550200	5551200	Oh, right.
5551200	5556200	Their slogan is, it's not a tumor because it has a B in it.
5556200	5557200	It's a good start.
5557200	5558200	It's spreading.
5561200	5565200	Children, something's spreading.
5567200	5570200	Did you notice the sense of wonderment in his voice?
5570200	5571200	He acted...
5571200	5572200	Ryan, I'm talking to you, motherfucker.
5572200	5574200	I was up in my head.
5574200	5577200	You need to watch because so far Steve is off to a pretty good look.
5579200	5581200	Hey, Andromeda.
5581200	5582200	Hi.
5583200	5585200	So you tracked me down?
5585200	5587200	We didn't get connected?
5587200	5589200	Look at his establishment.
5591200	5594200	No, I don't want to say no because that's bad improv,
5594200	5598200	but the idea is that we agreed to meet here.
5598200	5600200	Oh, we did.
5600200	5601200	Sorry.
5601200	5602200	He apologized.
5602200	5606200	I run like four calendars, including my own.
5606200	5609200	It's really hard to keep up with everything.
5609200	5611200	Why is that her problem?
5615200	5619200	Listen, let me tell you upfront, if we're going to start dating,
5619200	5622200	I'm not going to have very much time for you.
5622200	5623200	Why?
5623200	5625200	Is your job important to you?
5625200	5628200	My job is... I'm a workaholic.
5628200	5630200	Well, maybe it's worth that.
5630200	5633200	Tell me more about what you do for a living,
5633200	5635200	and I could probably support it.
5635200	5636200	I...
5636200	5638200	So I work in television and...
5638200	5639200	For real.
5639200	5640200	For real.
5640200	5641200	For real.
5641200	5645200	For this showrunner, writer, producer, he's a really good guy.
5645200	5646200	Josh Whedon?
5646200	5647200	No.
5648200	5649200	No, no.
5649200	5650200	Who is it?
5650200	5651200	He's very...
5651200	5652200	Very generous.
5652200	5653200	Excuse me.
5653200	5654200	Hold on.
5654200	5655200	Sorry.
5655200	5656200	Hello.
5656200	5660200	Steve, I can't figure out...
5660200	5661200	What's...
5661200	5664200	I'm trying to figure out how to get...
5664200	5667200	I can't watch the Apple TV right now.
5667200	5669200	This is insane that you're calling me.
5669200	5670200	I know, but...
5670200	5672200	It has to be really bad if you're calling me.
5672200	5674200	I can't get the Apple TV to work.
5674200	5676200	I want to watch this thing, and...
5676200	5678200	I don't know what the fuck is going on here.
5678200	5680200	Will you please just...
5680200	5682200	Just fix it for me.
5682200	5684200	I'm gonna email, text, and call them.
5684200	5685200	Don't worry.
5685200	5687200	Just fucking take care of them.
5687200	5690200	Someone will be there at the latest in the morning.
5690200	5691200	It's 11 o'clock at night.
5691200	5692200	I'll see if they can send somebody.
5692200	5695200	Can you get me something salty and sweet?
5699200	5702200	I know that it's two different things, but just...
5702200	5703200	Just fucking handle it.
5703200	5705200	I left that bag of chocolate pretzels
5705200	5707200	for exactly this reason.
5707200	5711200	Can I just say that he never complained...
5711200	5714200	That he's just letting you know...
5717200	5719200	If his TV breaks at 11 at night,
5719200	5722200	that's when you're gonna find out, motherfucker.
5722200	5725200	It doesn't mean you have to fix it at 11 at night,
5725200	5729200	but you sure as fuck gonna know when it breaks.
5729200	5731200	It's not your problem. You could not...
5731200	5734200	Andromeda knows. She's in the know.
5734200	5740200	Anyway, I just admire you for supporting someone
5740200	5742200	who is a TV showrunner,
5742200	5744200	which means they probably paid their dues.
5744200	5746200	Yeah, yeah.
5746200	5748200	I think that's...
5748200	5751200	Excuse me. One second.
5751200	5752200	Hello?
5752200	5755200	Where the fuck is my assistant, God damn it?
5755200	5758200	I haven't slept in three days.
5758200	5760200	Where's my assistant?
5760200	5761200	Oh, jeez.
5761200	5763200	Where's my fucking assistant?
5763200	5765200	I'm not picking up my fucking phone.
5765200	5767200	Is that Justin Roiland's voice on your phone?
5767200	5770200	Yeah. The Justin Roiland is calling me.
5770200	5772200	He calls you?
5772200	5774200	Where's my fucking assistant?
5774200	5776200	I'm trying to find my fucking assistant.
5776200	5778200	My sister is fucking...
5778200	5780200	Excuse me, I have a call.
5780200	5782200	Hello?
5782200	5784200	Hi, this is Chibby Chase.
5784200	5786200	I was trying to get a hold of Dan Harmon's assistant.
5786200	5788200	Chibby Chase? Chibby Chase?
5788200	5789200	Chibby Chase?
5789200	5791200	Hi, Fletch, how you doing?
5792200	5794200	Chibby Chase, how you doing?
5794200	5796200	Chibby Chase, Fletch?
5796200	5798200	I really enjoy your Fletch, Chibby Chase.
5798200	5800200	Are you Justin Roiland?
5800200	5802200	This is Justin Roiland, Fletch Chase.
5802200	5804200	You're Justin Roiland.
5804200	5806200	You're not fat, and you're a good writer.
5806200	5808200	Thank you very much, Chibby Chase.
5808200	5810200	I just called it to say you're not fat,
5810200	5812200	and you're a great writer. I'm a big fan.
5812200	5814200	I love your Fletch, Chase.
5814200	5816200	I love working with you. It's a pleasure to know you.
5816200	5818200	You're the best.
5818200	5820200	If you ever want to hang out and watch Grudge,
5820200	5822200	come over right now, Chibby Chase.
5822200	5824200	I'll come right over and watch it with you.
5824200	5825200	Chibby Chase?
5825200	5827200	I gotta go. I'm driving to your place.
5827200	5828200	Thank you, thank you.
5828200	5829200	I gotta call Uber.
5829200	5830200	Okay, great.
5830200	5832200	Holy shit, I just talked to Chibby Chase.
5834200	5835200	Holy shit.
5835200	5837200	Chibby Chase, did you hear any of that?
5837200	5838200	No.
5838200	5840200	That's insane.
5840200	5842200	Where the fuck is my assistant?
5842200	5844200	He's walking the dogs.
5844200	5846200	Oh yeah, that's right. I'm sorry.
5846200	5848200	Who is this? Why are you calling me?
5851200	5854200	I am so sorry.
5854200	5855200	It's okay.
5855200	5858200	Like I said, your life is so exciting.
5858200	5861200	This is honestly just like every date I'm ever on.
5861200	5863200	It's because I'm always working.
5863200	5866200	I don't feel sorry for you at all.
5866200	5868200	I don't at all.
5868200	5871200	I think it's an amazing sounding job.
5871200	5874200	I think you should be fucking thankful for every fucking minute of it.
5874200	5876200	Well, maybe then this could work out.
5876200	5878200	It depends.
5878200	5881200	I mean, if you're cool.
5881200	5886200	I mean, I just think the coolest thing about it is that you take it in stride.
5886200	5891200	Because, you know, I think that I imagine that the people that are calling you,
5891200	5893200	they must be special people.
5894200	5896200	I'm sorry, hold that up.
5896200	5899200	One thing, I'm so sorry.
5899200	5902200	Hello, this is Apple TV.
5903200	5907200	We heard that there was a problem with your Apple.
5907200	5909200	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5909200	5912200	It's not my Apple, it's my boss's Apple.
5912200	5917200	What's the shortest you could be at his house to fix it?
5917200	5922200	Because his girlfriend's over and they're not getting...
5922200	5924200	Who's his girlfriend?
5925200	5927200	Excuse me, I've got a call.
5929200	5931200	Hello, this is Apple TV.
5931200	5933200	Hello, this is Apple TV.
5933200	5934200	Hello, this is Apple TV.
5934200	5936200	Oh, I'm sorry, I must have got the lines crossed.
5936200	5938200	I was trying to call my son, Steve Levy.
5938200	5941200	Oh, he's on the phone. Let me connect you two.
5941200	5943200	Can you put us all through on a second?
5943200	5945200	Okay, here we go. Let me see if I do this.
5945200	5947200	Hello, Steve.
5947200	5949200	Steven, I'm your father from England.
5949200	5950200	What?
5950200	5951200	I'm your father.
5951200	5954200	Yes, your father's not Jewish, he's English.
5955200	5956200	Oh, man.
5956200	5958200	You can be Jewish and English, you know.
5958200	5961200	This is really sad to me because I saw on your dating profile
5961200	5963200	that your dad died when you were 17.
5963200	5964200	Yeah, yeah.
5964200	5965200	I'm calling on it.
5965200	5967200	I'm saying it's an experience for me right now.
5967200	5969200	Hello, Steve, this is a zombie hunter.
5969200	5972200	Is your dad calling or is he trying to get in touch with you?
5972200	5975200	Looks like he had a zombie problem with your dad.
5975200	5976200	Your dad is dead.
5976200	5978200	I've come back from the grave, Steven.
5978200	5979200	I've come back from the grave.
5979200	5980200	Don't listen to him.
5980200	5982200	To give you a piece of advice.
5982200	5983200	He wants your brain.
5983200	5985200	I've come back from the grave to eat your brains
5985200	5987200	and give you one piece of advice.
5988200	5990200	Don't work for Dan Hartman!
5990200	5993200	Steve, it's Steve, it's Brandon.
5993200	5994200	Brandon?
5994200	5996200	Yeah, both my parents are dead.
5996200	6000200	They died when I was a kid, so don't let anybody ever fuck you up about it.
6000200	6002200	Brandon, I'll take that.
6002200	6005200	Also, that makes me win.
6006200	6008200	Hello, Brandon.
6009200	6010200	Hello?
6010200	6011200	Brandon, this is your father.
6011200	6012200	Daddy.
6012200	6013200	Yes.
6013200	6015200	I just lied to Steve Levy about you.
6015200	6016200	I know you.
6016200	6017200	Don't ever...
6020200	6023200	What the fuck is going on?
6024200	6025200	What is going on here?
6025200	6026200	I can't find my...
6026200	6028200	I can't find anything here.
6028200	6030200	I've been up for four days.
6030200	6032200	I don't know what's going on.
6033200	6034200	What is that noise?
6034200	6037200	Somebody tell me what that noise is, for God's sake.
6037200	6042200	Steve, this is Dog the Fake Zombie Hunter Hunter.
6042200	6043200	Oh my God.
6043200	6045200	There's a zombie out there pretending to be a zombie hunter.
6045200	6046200	Oh my God.
6046200	6049200	And my boss wonders why I'm so overwhelmed.
6050200	6051200	You're overwhelmed?
6051200	6054200	You should try hunting fake zombie hunters.
6055200	6058200	What are you, an assistant to a genius?
6058200	6060200	That's a fucking cakewalk.
6060200	6062200	I dream of that job.
6063200	6064200	Noted.
6064200	6068200	It's worth an 11pm text letting you know that the fucking television doesn't work.
6068200	6070200	And here's why, Steve.
6071200	6074200	Because poor people can turn on their televisions.
6074200	6076200	Poor people can turn on their televisions.
6076200	6077200	I've heard this.
6077200	6078200	That's true.
6078200	6084200	I'm going to Best Buy right now and for $600 I have a device that turns on and off a TV.
6084200	6088200	It's fucked up for someone to pay $200,000 for a home automation system
6088200	6094200	so that they can wait for permission to watch X-Files from some dipshit in Malibu.
6095200	6098200	It's emasculating!
6098200	6099200	I'm on his side.
6099200	6100200	You're as passionate as my boss.
6100200	6102200	You should meet that guy.
6103200	6104200	Steve, it's me.
6104200	6106200	There's no such thing as a fake zombie hunter.
6106200	6107200	It's me.
6107200	6108200	You got me again.
6108200	6110200	I'm sorry, Steve.
6110200	6113200	Hey Dan, as long as you're on the phone, hey, can you talk to me for a second?
6113200	6117200	Justin, don't finish editing episode 304.
6117200	6119200	It's the worst.
6121200	6122200	That's not true.
6122200	6123200	That's so mean.
6123200	6125200	It's my fault.
6125200	6127200	It's going to be the worst episode of Rick and Morty ever.
6127200	6128200	You're very mean.
6128200	6129200	You're a very mean person.
6129200	6130200	I just need to say this.
6130200	6132200	I need to get this off my chest.
6132200	6137200	You're mean to me and you hurt my feelings about that picnic thing that I did the other day.
6137200	6140200	When I was doing the picnic thing, you don't even remember.
6141200	6142200	No.
6143200	6144200	Steve, I'm sorry.
6144200	6146200	Why are you looking at me?
6147200	6151200	Justin, let's try to make season four as good as we can.
6152200	6153200	Andromeda, one second.
6153200	6155200	I'm so, so sorry that this is still going on.
6155200	6156200	One second.
6156200	6157200	This is Chevy Chase.
6157200	6158200	I'm still on the line.
6159200	6161200	Should I hang up?
6161200	6163200	I don't even know what's going on.
6163200	6165200	I'm so drunk on box wine.
6165200	6166200	Steve, listen.
6166200	6167200	Zombie hunters are real.
6167200	6170200	No one's going to tell you that's the truth.
6170200	6172200	Steve, don't listen to any zombie hunters.
6172200	6174200	Spencer, I love you so much.
6174200	6175200	I'm so happy you're in my life.
6175200	6176200	Do you know Chevy Chase?
6176200	6177200	You're always here for me.
6177200	6178200	What?
6178200	6179200	You know Chevy Chase?
6179200	6180200	I don't.
6180200	6181200	I'm sorry.
6181200	6182200	Okay.
6182200	6183200	But he's been on the phone.
6183200	6184200	I'm still here.
6184200	6187200	And is Dan still on the line?
6187200	6188200	This is Andromeda.
6188200	6190200	I'm just listening on speaker phone here.
6190200	6191200	Okay.
6191200	6192200	Hey, Andromeda.
6192200	6193200	Hi.
6193200	6194200	Hi, Andromeda.
6194200	6195200	Are you sexy?
6197200	6198200	Chevy, this is Dan.
6198200	6199200	I'm listening.
6200200	6201200	Dan, you are here.
6201200	6202200	Yeah.
6202200	6203200	Hi.
6203200	6206200	I just came out of my Zinfandel field haze.
6208200	6210200	Remember the time I told you that you were just okay?
6210200	6211200	Yeah.
6211200	6214200	I meant you were all right.
6215200	6216200	Thank you.
6216200	6217200	Just all right.
6217200	6218200	Just all right.
6219200	6220200	Hey, Andromeda.
6220200	6222200	Yes.
6222200	6225200	I'm going to listen to a podcast with Cody.
6225200	6228200	You have a great date with Steve.
6228200	6230200	All right, Dan.
6231200	6232200	And for the record?
6232200	6233200	Yes.
6233200	6236200	I'm glad you're not Joss Whedon.
6237200	6238200	Thank you.
6239200	6241200	Go get her, Steve.
6241200	6242200	Thanks, Dan.
6242200	6244200	Or him or whatever.
6244200	6245200	It doesn't matter.
6245200	6249200	I advocate whatever it is that's going on over the other end of that phone.
6249200	6250200	Goodbye.
6250200	6251200	Bye.
6252200	6253200	So, wow.
6253200	6255200	So that's what you do for a living.
6255200	6257200	You just tell people you're overwhelmed.
6257200	6260200	That's 15 minutes in the life of Levi.
6262200	6264200	You do that on the weekends, too?
6264200	6265200	Yeah.
6265200	6268200	And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
6268200	6269200	Yeah.
6269200	6271200	Well, I work at fucking Staples.
6273200	6274200	Tell me about it.
6274200	6277200	So, from my perspective, it's called privilege.
6277200	6278200	Yeah.
6278200	6279200	Go figure.
6279200	6280200	Yeah.
6280200	6284200	And if I get pregnant, I don't work at Staples anymore.
6284200	6290200	And if I have a baby, I can't work at Staples until the baby's old enough to work at Staples,
6290200	6293200	in which case he'll get paid more than me.
6294200	6297200	So, smallest violin?
6299200	6300200	But I'm sorry.
6300200	6306200	I'm a combative young lady that's your age that I think would be good for you.
6308200	6309200	Thank you.
6311200	6312200	I love it.
6312200	6318200	What do you think about no wrong answers, like the involvement of the butthole?
6320200	6324200	If I'm blowing you pinky, tickle the rim.
6324200	6325200	No involvement?
6325200	6327200	Answer carefully.
6327200	6336200	Honestly, I've never tried it, but I've suggested it to other people.
6339200	6340200	Good answer.
6340200	6342200	It's a dangerous game.
6343200	6346200	It's the most dangerous game.
6348200	6352200	You're like the vampire of a shot of butt play.
6352200	6355200	It's also the plot of The Ring 3.
6355200	6356200	Right.
6358200	6359200	All right.
6359200	6365200	It's almost worth interrupting to say, what do you mean you've suggested it to other people?
6367200	6368200	Was that not true?
6368200	6369200	No, he's synthetic.
6369200	6371200	No, I know it's about him, wasn't it?
6371200	6372200	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
6373200	6375200	You have suggested this to people?
6376200	6380200	Personally, I have no butthole experience.
6381200	6382200	Let's see it.
6382200	6384200	We changed that tonight, huh?
6385200	6386200	How many people?
6386200	6388200	Butthole experience.
6389200	6390200	All right.
6390200	6392200	Well, what have we learned over six years?
6393200	6395200	Use the right pronouns.
6397200	6399200	Trump will never get elected.
6401200	6403200	Third party's the way to go.
6407200	6408200	We're evolving.
6410200	6412200	TV's getting better and better.
6413200	6414200	Jesus, Annie.
6417200	6420200	Happiness will win out in the end.
6421200	6425200	A 10-day waiting period is more than enough for a gun.
6426200	6428200	I still haven't picked mine up yet.
6428200	6434200	But also, unfortunately, that applies to watching Atlanta and get out, which I still haven't done.
6435200	6441200	You tried getting out and going and buying tickets to shit when your knee hurts.
6442200	6444200	You don't have to buy tickets to Atlanta.
6444200	6446200	It's a TV show.
6447200	6451200	You're going out and doing stuff because your apartment's hot, because you're poor.
6453200	6456200	Once you're over 40, you're going to want to hang out.
6456200	6459200	You have to get a gun to see movies about black people.
6461200	6462200	Oh, come on.
6464200	6467200	I'm so glad that there was not a mic on him for that.
6468200	6470200	Anyways, well, here's where we were born.
6470200	6475200	Here's not where we're dying, but Harmentown is moving out from its parents' basement.
6477200	6479200	But we're taking you with us!
6482200	6485200	Under your seat is a glass of Kool-Aid and a tablet.
6488200	6493200	We're moving into our beaded curtain attic with Jan.
6494200	6503200	We're going to learn what speakers actually cost and all the other things that happened in your 20s,
6503200	6506200	which in podcast years, Harmentown has entered its mid-20s.
6507200	6509200	We're leveling up. The show's only going to get better.
6509200	6511200	Dustin's wearing white now.
6513200	6514200	We got two Leavies.
6516200	6518200	One's made of straw.
6519200	6522200	It's just a Leavy-shaped scarecrow.
6524200	6526200	Especially they're going to wear a suit the entire time,
6526200	6528200	and I'm going to wear lumberjack shirts and shorts.
6532200	6534200	But we're going to renew, probably.
6534200	6537200	Let's get to the moon when we go to the place, but we'll have a good show,
6537200	6539200	but we've got to get out of here because we're giving up,
6539200	6542200	because we do believe that people are stupid.
6542200	6544200	We're going to continue to care about them and love them,
6544200	6545200	but we know that they're stupid.
6545200	6547200	We just don't expect any more of them.
6547200	6549200	The planet's going to be eaten alive by dumb people.
6549200	6551200	Dan, we only have a couple minutes left.
6552200	6554200	Why don't we just wrap it out in good fashion?
6554200	6556200	Our last wrap on this stage.
6560200	6561200	Thanks, John Carmen.
6561200	6562200	Thanks, John Carmen.
6562200	6564200	John Carmen, everybody.
6564200	6565200	Here we go.
6565200	6567200	Thanks for coming, Mitch.
6567200	6568200	Thank you.
6568200	6569200	Thanks for having me.
6569200	6571200	Feel free to jump in on this wrap if you want.
6571200	6573200	No, I'm not going to at all.
6573200	6574200	I don't feel free to.
6574200	6575200	All right, everybody.
6575200	6578200	Give it up for your mayor, Dan Armin.
6582200	6583200	You got it, Armin. Let's go.
6583200	6585200	Final wrap on the meltdown stage.
6585200	6587200	Only you can fucking do this.
6587200	6590200	No, I think this whole wrap has to be Mitch Hurwitz only.
6590200	6592200	I think it has to be Mitch.
6592200	6596200	You know, I don't know a lot about the founding fathers,
6596200	6598200	so my wrap isn't great.
6600200	6602200	You know that bitch is crazy with Ben Franklin.
6602200	6603200	I know that.
6603200	6605200	I don't know how to wrap.
6605200	6606200	Wrap?
6606200	6608200	I'll do some.
6608200	6609200	Wrap.
6609200	6610200	Wrap.
6610200	6611200	Wrap.
6611200	6612200	Wrap.
6613200	6614200	Wrap.
6614200	6616200	It's a game you play with your mouth.
6616200	6619200	At the end of the day, you just move your lips,
6619200	6620200	and the words come out.
6620200	6623200	And teeth go up, and your lips go south.
6623200	6625200	You got to say what you're on your mind,
6625200	6629200	and then you say what you can find in your soul.
6629200	6630200	When you look down deep,
6630200	6633200	I fucked your mama so hard she turned into a sheep.
6633200	6634200	Oh.
6634200	6635200	And then she counted herself,
6635200	6638200	going up and down up to the upper shelf.
6638200	6639200	I got her pussy up high.
6639200	6640200	I got her pussy down low.
6640200	6643200	I got her pussy in the middle, and away we go.
6643200	6646200	Yo, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.
6646200	6648200	How many mamas do you think you fucked so far?
6648200	6652200	5,000, motherfucker.
6652200	6654200	Round number.
6656200	6658200	Thanks for asking.
6660200	6662200	I'll tell you about every single one of them.
6662200	6663200	Oh.
6663200	6666200	Mother number one, I fucked to the sun.
6666200	6667200	Mother number two,
6667200	6669200	I fucked with some goo.
6669200	6671200	Mother number three, I fucked instead of peeing,
6671200	6672200	and so no mother number four,
6672200	6674200	I made my penis kind of sore.
6674200	6676200	Mother number five, I brought my dick back alive.
6676200	6680200	Mother number six, I fucked with some sticks, it was gross.
6680200	6682200	But she asked for it, it was consensual,
6682200	6685200	and that's all I'm going to say about it.
6685200	6687200	Mother number seven,
6687200	6689200	the only thing that's going to rhyme is heaven.
6689200	6691200	You already know that, so that's where I fucked her.
6691200	6693200	Mother number eight, who knows?
6693200	6695200	Wait, oh.
6695200	6699200	Mother number nine, whoa, that mother was fine.
6699200	6701200	She was so fine, I never fucked her again,
6701200	6705200	but then along came mother ten.
6705200	6709200	Mother eleven was a lot like mother seven.
6709200	6711200	Mother number twelve, into which I won't dwell,
6711200	6715200	because privacy was her main thing.
6715200	6718200	Along with lack of rhyming.
6718200	6721200	Mother number thirteen was a jelly bean.
6721200	6723200	I'm going to fuck her, I'm going to fuck her,
6723200	6724200	I'm going to fuck her, I'm going to fuck her,
6724200	6727200	I'm going to fuck me.
6727200	6729200	That's not, don't applaud that, don't applaud that.
6729200	6731200	That's not.
6731200	6733200	Mother fourteen, and then there's a bunch of mothers
6733200	6734200	that would only rhyme with.
6734200	6736200	We have 4,989 to go.
6736200	6741200	Mother 4,900 wasn't so good, and my dick got all scrundled.
6741200	6743200	I made up words, because by that time,
6743200	6745200	I was ready to fuck birds,
6745200	6747200	and I fucked your momma until I could fly.
6747200	6749200	I put some wings on my dick, it went up so high,
6749200	6752200	I went up to heaven, said hi to mother number seven,
6752200	6757200	and came down and fucked mother, again.
6757200	6761200	But here's what I learned from fucking all those mothers.
6761200	6764200	There's no other like a mother.
6764200	6766200	You can't even fuck a brother,
6766200	6768200	and have it be as good as a mother.
6768200	6771200	But that's not a homophobic statement,
6771200	6773200	because if you're gay,
6773200	6775200	then your brother can be a mother.
6775200	6779200	But that's not saying gay people are incestuous.
6779200	6785200	I should probably get out of this area.
6785200	6787200	One of the things we learned at this space
6787200	6790200	is that there takes a lot of people to make a human race.
6790200	6792200	There's people that are born one way and say,
6792200	6794200	hey, I'm going to be another way.
6794200	6796200	And why would you bother to say,
6796200	6798200	hey, why are you going to be that way?
6798200	6799200	That doesn't make any sense.
6799200	6802200	There's a lot of better ways to spend your energy.
6802200	6804200	If you're lazy, you're actually progressive,
6804200	6806200	because you're like, who gives a shit?
6806200	6808200	And a lot of people are like, thank you.
6808200	6812200	It's when we care that we really end up fucking everything up,
6812200	6815200	especially when we care about ourselves.
6815200	6819200	You should always thank you, ma'am.
6819200	6820200	Not to call you ma'am.
6820200	6823200	You can be anything you want.
6823200	6825200	That's what we learned the most.
6825200	6828200	Six years go by like a flash in the pan.
6828200	6831200	I fucked your mama until my name was Dan.
6831200	6833200	I fucked your mama all over the land.
6833200	6836200	I fucked it from the horizon to the frying pan.
6836200	6838200	I put a piece of butter on my...
6838200	6840200	OK, all right.
6840200	6842200	Oh, shit!
6845200	6847200	17 years.
6847200	6849200	Let's hear it for Steve.
6849200	6851200	Steve Levy.

6891200	6893200	that we're just doing right now.
6893200	6896200	Dave Klein.
6896200	6899200	Adam Goldberg.
6899200	6901200	Everybody that we love here.
6901200	6903200	All of our beautiful friends.
6903200	6906200	Church making all the photos happen online.

6913200	6916200	and take as many chances as you possibly can.
6917200	6919200	We love you.
6919200	6922200	Rob Johnson, no joke!
6922200	6926200	Also, thank you Greg for bringing me this fantastic scotch.
6926200	6928200	Greg everywhere.
6928200	6930200	Whoever brought me these beautiful cufflinks,
6930200	6932200	I love you for that.
6932200	6934200	The Burnett Blocker.
6934200	6935200	The lovely cards.
6935200	6937200	All the artwork you brought us.
6937200	6939200	It will never be the same without a nerd mount.
6939200	6941200	But please join us at Burbank.
6941200	6944200	We'll make it extra good.
6947200	6950200	Also, Ryan Ridley, we wish you well
6950200	6953200	on your dating journey.
6953200	6954200	Thank you.
6954200	6956200	We love you Ridley, you'll get it.
6956200	6958200	Thank you.
6976200	6978200	Did you get any of that?
6978200	6981200	It's a good show.
