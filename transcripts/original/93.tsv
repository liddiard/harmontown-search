0	26640	Hello, everybody. Welcome to Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California, from the Kodak Theater
26640	33840	in Hollywood, and the 174th Annual Academy Awards. This is Harbin Town. Harbin Town is
33840	41600	once again a session. Please welcome the chairman of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,
41600	52720	and the mayor of Harbin Town, Dan Harbin. Thank you. Thanks for coming out. It's Oscar night.
52800	58720	It's not, you shouldn't be expected to be here, and you're heroic for being here. We have a
58720	67200	heroically medium-sized audience. Are the Oscars still going on right now? I saw 17 fat guys in
67200	72960	tuxedos walking down the road, which means it just let out, or they just said, fuck it. Well, those
72960	81120	guys, yeah, they're done. The award for best fat guy, they're like, fuck it. But there's probably
81120	88080	still a couple as we're up here on stage right now. Are they currently running right now? Yeah.
88080	95920	Do we know any biggies? I won't watch it. Who wants to be our live... All right, Tyler. Tyler's
95920	102880	put up with his fair share of shit. He's always got his iPhone. Tyler, get out your Oscar app,
104240	108560	and let us know when the best director, best movie, yeah, as they come in.
111840	119280	What a fucking... I'm glad, I'm so glad I missed the in memoriam this year. That's something I
119280	125440	missed, because what a fucking... Okay, so let's start with that. Let's start with this really sad
125440	136000	shit. Harold Ramis has shuffled... Yeah, well, you guys didn't do anything wrong. I just think
136000	144000	that's a funny way to mourn. I think that was just polite. No, I know, I know, I know. They didn't
144000	149920	do anything wrong. It's just funny how we sound. It's funny how we behave. I never met Harold
149920	157120	Ramis. I don't... This is nothing... Family members of mine have died, that I have not...
157680	165520	I just Asperger it out. I don't fucking care. I have talked to grandfathers on the phone,
165520	172240	the night before they went into surgery, that they may or may not survive. And I have talked
172240	176480	to them and gone, good luck in that surgery, and found out they didn't make it, and was like,
179120	186080	and that's just a fact. Laid up against the fact that I was... When I found out through Twitter
186080	195440	that Harold Ramis died, my knees buckled and I sat on a piece of flagstone on a sidewalk in Burbank
195600	201920	and I know that this is all about me. I'm not... I know because I don't know this person. He's a
201920	210080	celebrity. He's a stranger, but he was an important celebrity to me and to so many people. And I
211520	221360	wept publicly, not publicly like I was performing. I wept in public. I wept on a sidewalk in Burbank,
221360	227840	tears running down my face for about 15 minutes. I was late to my next appointment. You hear that,
227840	234160	Harold Ramis? So you felt more connected to a person that you never met than than to
234160	238800	grandfathers. Yeah, I don't know. I think it's important. What the important thing about that
238800	244000	is that when people die, when celebrities die especially, they're symbolic. They spend their
244000	250720	lives symbolically. Their deaths are symbolic too. As a writer, most of my heroes I choose very well
250720	256800	because they commit suicide and you don't mourn them. They mourn themselves and then they kill
256800	263440	themselves. My heroes, Spalding Grey, Hunter Thompson, they do themselves in one way or another.
263440	268480	And in fact, Philip Seymour Hoffman fits into that category in a small way. People that are
268480	275520	really passionate, people that really... they're incredible. Yeah, they leave too soon, but there's
275520	282720	something comforting about or something that you don't have to deal with because if they pursue
282720	290960	this sort of brightly lit path. Harold Ramis was not going down that path. 69 is too young to die
290960	300240	for a man who wrote truly like every comedy. I remember being in the theater for Ghostbusters.
300240	305280	Do you remember where you were? Yes, yes, yes. Mike Ollenberg's 12th birthday. We went to see
305280	312000	Ghostbusters and I had no idea. Back then, in Milwaukee, there was no internet or anything.
312000	316400	But you were what, 10, 11? You must have been here. Yeah, 11 or something like that. You'd go to see
316400	320880	a poster outside to see a bunch of guys with some Ghostbusters clothes on. You go in, you
320880	327760	pay your ticket, you sit there. Unbelievable. But I mean, talk about Groundhog Day, Caddyshack.
327760	342000	Caddyshack, motherfucker. The list evolves. You don't want to defile anybody's memory by
342000	348800	comparing them to people. But the extent to which we mourned John Hughes, that means that we have to
348800	356560	really observe the incredible vacuum that is left by Harold Ramis because his movies were
358080	368960	... we quote them always. All of his jokes, all of his dialogue, and yet you can't find a movie that
368960	379120	he ever wrote that had any toxicity to it. Some of them were sillier than others. Some of them were
379120	383840	dumb. But in every single one of them, the people that were heroes were the people that were
383840	391040	underestimated. They were people versus the system. And I think the thing that made me really
391040	398880	start weeping on a sidewalk in Burbank was it was totally narcissistic because I never even
398880	403920	thought about it. And I think that's a beauty. It's such a testament to his work is that he just
403920	410960	fit like a brick into a wall of all of our lives. And then only when it comes out do you realize
410960	416000	what's missing. And only when you think about what that means to you, do you realize something
416000	424160	that you were holding on to. In my case, I was holding on to this idea that the good guys could
424160	431120	live forever. And I didn't count myself among them. I figured I would be one of those other guys.
431120	438080	But I also thought that the good guys could live for at least 100 years, if not forever. I thought
439040	444960	that the guys that just made you feel good, I thought that they could earn their way to some
444960	452240	form of immortality or super mortality. And it's weird at 69 for somebody of that caliber to die.
453440	459680	Anyway, so I sat on a fucking sidewalk. I don't know of any celebrity that ever died that I ever
459680	465600	wept for. And I'm crying now talking about it. And it's all personal. It's all weird.
466560	473920	For some cosmic mother to come to you and say to you, you can't have that blanket anymore
473920	478240	and take it away. And for you to suddenly realize there was a blanket there, I never knew I had it.
478240	484320	I didn't know that I thought that you could write your way around death. I didn't know that I
484320	492560	thought that Harold Ramis was going to live forever. And then he was gone. It was a gust
492880	498640	of air, horrible, weird, narcissistic fit that I had outside some hat shop.
498640	504720	I'm afraid that even like you, your eyes are red and watery. If I start talking about it,
504720	510480	I may cry for the same reason just saying. And also people that I look up to,
511440	520080	I didn't realize like you looked up to him, the eulogies he got are unlike anybody's I've ever
520080	525440	like, there was a certain kind of eulogizing that went on for Harold where people were like,
527680	534880	he affected people in a very specific way that gets really, really sad. But that he did achieve
534880	543040	immortality in that sense. Well, of course. Yeah. But we want him to taste waffles for 40 extra
543040	548960	years. I thought that he would outlive me. I didn't know that I thought that. I thought that
548960	555120	when I died, the world I left would have an old Harold Ramis in it. I really did. I didn't
555120	561520	know that I thought that, but I really thought that. And it's an odd, strange thing. You guys
561520	571040	are 25. You've got your Jared Leto and you should hang on to him. But what if the world takes him
571040	581680	tomorrow? What if the world did? And this podcast drops some moments before. Jared Leto
581680	589360	began tonight's Oscars in an amazing fashion. I went to an Academy Awards once. If I told the
589360	595200	story, I was getting my hair cut like years ago. It would have been the one where Halle Berry won
595200	600880	Best Actress and Sidney Poitier was there. And I think it was right after 9-11. Yeah. She doesn't
601040	607680	want it. Yeah. Whatever the one the Academy Awards right after the planes hit the buildings and
607680	617760	that was 9-11. The Academy Awards weren't on 9-11. Oh, sorry. You were trying to remember a date
617760	624880	and you were. Can I help? I hope I haven't told the story before. I was going to get my hair cut.
624880	630400	And as I'm walking up to the back door of the of the place, I get my haircut for many years.
630400	634560	I realize, oh, it's Sunday. Like this guy's not even open on Sunday. What the fuck am I thinking?
634560	639760	And also why am I walking up without without an appointment? And I walk in and as I'm walking
639760	643600	through, oh, it's Sunday. He won't be open, but the door is open. And it's my friend, Bob,
644480	649120	stylist, and he's there and he's cutting one woman's hair and she has two gowns
649120	655360	hung next to her where she's getting her haircut. One beautiful white gown, one beautiful black gown
655360	658880	and she's getting a haircut. And I've never seen these two before. I've never seen this woman
658880	666000	before. And I go, oh, Bob, I'm sorry. Like it's not only Sunday, it's Academy Awards Sunday.
666000	670400	Like, I don't know what I was thinking. He goes, Jeff, hang on. And the woman whispers something
670400	677360	in his ear and he goes, Jeff, what are you doing tonight? And I go, nothing. He goes,
677360	684640	do you want to go to the Academy Awards? I was like, what? Because her date just backed out.
684640	693040	She has no date. And she was, I won't get the specifics. She had been nominated for an award
693040	700240	as a technical Academy Award for a film in the 90s. So she's allowed to go to the Academy Awards.
700240	704800	If I say the movie, you'll be able to triangulate who she is and I won't be able to talk shit about
704800	708560	her for the rest of the story. She did all the props for nine and a half weeks.
708560	714240	She was the reason why you feel like that's Mickey Rooney's come.
717200	724880	Mickey Rooney. Mickey Rourke. Yeah. The reason why you feel like Mickey Rourke's come is Mickey
724880	729280	Rooney. Mickey Rooney. Because it's actually Mickey Rooney. There was a woman. This woman
729280	734720	was in charge of milking him, milking Mickey Rooney. Coaxing Mickey Rooney's 80 year old
734720	739920	come out of him. That was an important part of that film. It was like, oh yeah, Mickey Rourke.
739920	747600	I'm sure it's going to be white and frothy. It had been so jaundiced. It had to be like semi
747600	752720	transparent. It had to be Mickey Rooney's come because only Mickey Rooney's come sparkles like
752720	758640	that. With the sparkles of showbiz. Yeah. 35 millimeter, no come sparkles like old Mickey
758640	765200	Rooney, 80 year old come. I went with her and she got drunk. She got so drunk, I was embarrassed
765200	769360	and she tried to schmooze everybody. It was the fucking worst night. However, it was the Oscars
769360	775600	where Woody Allen was there and Sidney Poitier was there. I just cried the whole goddamn time
775600	781040	because it was so amazing. Also, the in memoriam thing always gets you. But like you said, this
781040	786480	one would have been a real railroad train for two reasons I can name. I don't know about these
786480	792400	electricians that died, but I know that. Anyone in the crowd know who else would have been like
793760	800800	Shirley Temple? Shirley Temple died this year? Since Caesar died? Yes. Jesus Christ on a cracker.
802000	805680	Okay. So I wanted to do this thing tonight. I was just thinking the green right before we went on.
805680	809680	I don't know how this will work, but well, let me, let me explain that later actually. Because once I
809680	814080	explained it, we'll start doing it. But let me, let me see if you guys ever watched the youngsters
814080	819200	in the crowd. Have you guys watched Sid Caesar's, your show of shows? Yes. Yeah. Like that to me,
819760	823440	like I was on a tour bus. The guy that said yes was so old. You could tell from his voice.
824560	830720	At least 29. Yes. That was Carl Reiner. I drink wine out of a box.
832800	839440	But that shit is funny. Like Sid Caesar, oh my lord. And also people ask like who the funniest
839440	844480	women you know? Like for me, imaging coca. I don't know if you guys don't know her. We know her as the,
844480	852800	as a grandma on vacation with, with, with your pal Chevy. But, uh, Sid Caesar, your show of shows.
852800	859040	Holy smokes. Yeah. Everybody watch it. Download the holotapes and watch it. All right. So here
859040	863360	comes the, uh, I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't, I wasn't, you got better things to do. Yeah. Well,
863360	867040	well I want to, I do. You're still crying. You're still crying. I'm still crying about Harold Remus
867040	874240	and you're fucking talking about imaging coca. You've never cried about another star passing
874240	881120	before Harold Remus? No, I was, I, I got bent out of shape about, uh, uh, Spalding Gray and I got
881120	885840	bent out of shape about Hunter S. Thompson. But the reason I got bent out of shape is that I felt
885840	892240	like at the risk of sounding incredibly presumptuous. I, not because I equate myself with these men,
892560	899360	uh, but because I feel a certain relationship to them. I feel like maybe I'm a certain sub breed
899360	904560	of the human species. I feel like there's a confirmation there when these guys do,
905440	909520	there's just a part of you that thinks like, what is this sickness called life? And how do you,
909520	914080	how do you get out of it? How do you cure it? And I, the, the, the guys that you really look up to
914080	919280	when they, when they take that way out, I just, you know, I don't want to hear, you know, bums me out.
919360	926080	All right. Uh, but, but you don't have to mourn because they fucking took off. They said goodbye.
926080	931600	Like those are the friends I like, I like an Irish goodbye, but, but, but Harold Remus too young,
931600	935360	too, too friendly. Hunter did the thing where he killed himself, but also like in the kitchen
935360	939760	where his family had to fucking scoop him up and shit. Like, like, don't do that. If you're going
939760	945360	to blow your brains out, like do it in a fucking, like in a plastic lined room with a team, a team
945360	950560	of professionals get to clean you up before your fucking daughter comes. All right. Anyways. Uh,
950560	954880	all right. So a couple of quick things before I, I want to do an experiment tonight. I don't know if
954880	960080	it'll work at all, but it's Oscar night. Uh, I did, I did this. I went in, did I tell you guys,
960080	964320	I was going to, I'm going to, I did this. I went in and did the D and D book on tape thing.
967440	971520	I went into a little booth and I read a story from the point of view of
971520	979200	Diz Dorden, a famous dark elf from the underworld who walks the surface world. Uh, uh, and who,
979200	984640	and who, uh, doesn't want to be like other drow and, and is like, seems like kind of a Vulcan
984640	990160	character and he has little adventures and I'm him reading the story. And then, and then part
990160	994080	of the story, he runs into a goblin and the engineer told me, he's like, you just go in and
994080	998320	the engineer goes, look, here's, if you run into a word, you don't know how to say it. I'll, I'll
998320	1004000	pull up a thing that is like a recording of a guy. So you go like, I, I went through the halls
1004000	1008080	of myth. All right, fuck it. And then the, and then you're just hearing your headphones.
1008080	1015440	Mithraler door. I went through the halls of Mithraler door and I did the thing. Uh, but then,
1015440	1020320	but then the guy also said like, you know, you might encounter a goblin or two. Uh,
1020320	1025680	do you not have to get too fancy? I know, I know what he meant. I, I knew, I knew that
1025680	1030000	Ice-T and David Duchovny probably fucking put too much mustard on it when they ran into a goblin.
1030000	1034400	I knew what he meant. I was like, I don't want to do that. I can imagine David Duchovny like
1035040	1040080	mustering a fucking goblin, but I'm, you mean David Duchovny, right? David Duchovny motherfucking
1040080	1047600	nobody. Uh, who we still, I mean, maybe, who knows? Can we get him over here? Uh, but I, uh, uh,
1047600	1051200	Duchovny on Harmon town, but I just found myself naturally, I was reading the story and I was into
1051200	1055760	the story and it was like, I, I pulled my bow string back tight. The goblin looked at me,
1055760	1066880	his leathery lips hissing and the white middle earth sun. Please old master. Like that's the voice
1066880	1071040	I did. I did kind of a, what do you, I mean, what are you going to do? And the engineer was like,
1071040	1077360	nice. He was into it and I, I went through the whole thing. It was like 52 pages. I did it in
1077360	1087920	a couple of hours, probably buck 20. And, uh, he said I was the best. He said, because I understood
1087920	1095200	the story. So I just picture, I used to be like, I was, oh, all right. So go across the river. The,
1095200	1103680	my spirit animal followed me. I don't know. Fucking this shit doesn't track. But I was like,
1103680	1110240	into it. Cause I, I attacked the felled ogre and then I, and then I would go back and he was like,
1110240	1114000	no, it was fine. I said, no, but the felled ogre is a different ogre. I should have stressed felt
1114960	1119200	what was the fellow ogre I can see in my head. I know where, which ogre is where.
1119760	1125280	So when you, so when you buy that story from audible.com, was the story called
1125280	1135680	days and nights of a fucking dark alpha, the white middle earth sun. I don't know.
1137120	1143760	This character drizzed, drizzed door. And he's like, apparently the most written about D and D
1143760	1148720	character. I don't know. And, and there, I, well, we talked about this, like will Wheaton and David
1148720	1153760	Duchovny do all this shit. Any chance that they would have to do pickups where you and ice tea
1153760	1157920	and Duchovny would be in the same booth? We all have to come in. That would be the amazing thing.
1157920	1162480	If ice tea would play some of the ogres or the farmers, they're like, hey, man, we're looking
1162480	1169440	for these ogres. And I drew my bowstring back. Why are you drawing it back now? Uh, cause I,
1169440	1174000	it's cause it's got a plus two under normal conditions or do you have to save versus
1174000	1184960	ogre enchantment? Good point. Good point. Uh, in my, in my largest fantasies, uh,
1184960	1190560	Spencer is the dungeon master and you Duchovny and ice tea are on a campaign together. That,
1190560	1195440	that would be, yeah, I mean, that would be a fucking doozy because ice tea would be like,
1195440	1200160	I dropped my bowstring back and especially, well, you don't have a bow. Well, you, what the fuck?
1200160	1207280	Well, like Spencer would just dispense. He'd like start rifling through my shit. Like it'd be
1207280	1210880	like, I, and then I'd go like catch him and he'd go, it's not, you know, it's not business. It's
1210880	1216800	personal or whatever. All right. All right. So one more piece of celebrity gossip. Stephen Colbert
1216800	1222800	loves community. I just wanted to tell you that. All right. Who cares? He didn't say he loves
1222800	1226560	harm in town. So what are we, what are we going to do? Fuck him. Dino went to New York. He hung
1226560	1230720	out with his old buddies, Louis CK and Stephen Colbert. I texted Dino Stamatopoulos and I said,
1230720	1234480	are you back in town yet? He goes, no, he goes, but I am going to the Russian tea room right now
1234480	1239600	to have a dinner with Colbert. And it was right at the time. Like it was mid afternoon here,
1239600	1245920	which means Colbert had just taped and they met at the, at the Russian tea room and sat down like
1245920	1251200	my dinner was on. Dino got to have a real Liam Neeson taken father fantasy because his daughter,
1251200	1257760	who is now what, 15, 16, which is weird that she's old enough now to be a Colbert fan that
1257760	1264720	he took her to see Colbert. And then during the warmup, Colbert, somebody, some, some snarky
1264720	1269280	gentleman said like, do you love me more than anything or something? Colbert said, no, I love
1269280	1273200	this guy more than anything. And pointed at Dino and then started telling stories about Dino in
1273200	1278160	front of his daughter who clearly, who was obligated to hate him, you know, but, but who
1278160	1282640	is a big fan of Colbert. And it's, you know, that's a, that's a cool story for a dad of a
1282640	1287760	teenage daughter. All right. Anyways. What do you guys care? What the fuck do you care? So,
1287760	1292400	so it's Oscar night. It's Oscar night. Tyler. Yeah. Tyler Oscar update.
1296160	1298160	All right. Best screenplay, but 12 years a slave.
1301280	1302160	Sweet.
1302480	1302960	That's great.
1302960	1308640	It's Pat Jones, Swake Jones for her. I haven't seen but half of the, of the nominated,
1308640	1312400	like major features. I really liked her. I thought that was fantastic. Cause you know,
1312400	1316240	the great thing, the fucking Oscars, they let you down every year. It's just a pageant,
1316240	1322080	a goddamn garbage bullshit, but the category of best original screenplay, like it's never,
1323520	1328000	I have never had a problem with it. Like, like, like it always is actually the best original
1328000	1330960	screenplay because that's the one that was nominated because that's the award that you're
1331840	1336000	only going to win probably. No, I'm going to adapt. I'm going to adapt your, your life.
1337680	1341200	But I haven't written my life. It's going to be called 12 years of fuck face.
1347920	1354800	I don't know when we became an old, such an old school comedy team, 12 years of fuck face.
1355200	1362240	All right. We, we were having drinks and drawing them earlier. Yes, we were. That's part of the
1362240	1367200	thing is that it's Oscar day and we were, we were drinking since I took a big nap. So I'm
1367200	1374160	fine now, but I was always awakened from my slumber by Jared Leto in the house.
1375760	1379840	Well, basically like I passed out on my bed. Aaron was having a couple of people over for
1379840	1386880	Oscars. So it's playing in the other room. Jared Leto wins for best whatever, an adaptation
1386880	1395760	of a person. Okay. Best adaptation of an actor. So his speech, like very, it's a very tempered
1395760	1401040	sapphire eyes. It was beautifully sculpted eyebrows. It's wonderful flowing long river
1401040	1405680	runs through it. Were you awake during this? No, I just, well, this is what I see in my dreams,
1405680	1411040	but I was stirred because I was laying, I'm just, I'm just hearing Oscar tripe. I don't care.
1411040	1416880	And then he goes, because he goes like, thank you so much. This award is important. And it's heavy
1416880	1424240	in my hand and it's great. Wonderful award. And then he changes gears. He shifts out his pelvis
1424240	1430640	and he goes, you know, in 1971, there was a thing that happened. And I'm like, my ears perk up in
1430640	1434240	my sleep because I'm like, okay, here comes the age. Here comes the, here comes the Argentina.
1434240	1439440	I don't know what something worthwhile. I'm sure 1971, this thing I'm talking about, blah, blah,
1439440	1444240	blah. He keeps talking and talking and talking. And I slowly realized 1971, he's talking about
1444240	1451520	himself, the creation of himself, his own birth. I'm not kidding. In 1971, a woman was, a woman
1451520	1456640	was admitted to the hospital. She had pains in her stomach and the contractions were getting
1456640	1463920	more and more severe. And she slowly, her vagina thrusts a naked young man into the world. He
1463920	1468480	didn't know what befell him. Are you fucking kidding me? He didn't know what was along his path.
1469040	1474320	But tonight is the end of that path. And I hold the gold and I'm wallaboo. Now I'm making all of
1474320	1483440	that up, but I'm not, I'm not, I'm just saying for real, he, he shifted gears in 1971. And he wasn't,
1483440	1489760	he didn't then go on to talk about the Spanish civil war or something. He didn't go on to talk
1489760	1493600	about, which was 30 years before that. I knew, I knew you'd call me on that.
1494560	1499600	He started on his own birth. So I was like, I bolted up because it was like, and, and at some
1499600	1503520	point he was like, and then it's good to win this Oscar and it's great. And my brother's out there
1503520	1509520	in 30 seconds to Mars and it's great. He plugged his band. No, he plugged his band.
1510240	1513920	I, there's only one thing I like about this story is that he's older than me.
1516160	1519760	No, that's the other thing. I bolted up. I was like, he's 43.
1519760	1526480	Fuck it. The world's my oyster. This guy's handsome. And Aaron, Aaron, but keep putting
1526480	1530720	your hand in my arm and drink more water. Like, like, like, like, just like you could view that.
1530720	1537120	You can take it. Yeah, you can still do it. Do some crunches. Holy fuck.
1537920	1544640	But he, it was like, like, as far as Oscar speeches, you know, you got Jared Leto was the opener.
1544640	1548720	They've, they've done a healthy restructuring where they, they throw you a bone. They give you
1548720	1552480	the actors at the top of the show. Now they start off with the biggies. And then at the end,
1552480	1556160	toward the end of the show, right before I got in my car, what's her name from 12 years,
1556160	1560480	a slave, the girl who played Patsy. I don't know her at the actor's Tyler. What's her name?
1562480	1567440	Hard name. Crazy name. It's got an ad loop.
1569760	1572160	For net, for net Baraka one for best supporting actress.
1573280	1577600	It was, it was an intensely beautiful, perfect four point landing speech.
1578240	1580400	Can we, can we, can we hear your impression of her speech?
1580400	1584880	She said something like she, I mean, honestly, more way more articulately than I could have
1584880	1595360	ever put it. She said something to the effect of we win these awards for portraying people who
1595360	1601840	went through a lot of fucking pain. I actually, she said it really beautifully. And, and just,
1601840	1610080	it was a really, really good speech. It didn't go egregiously. Actory, let's, let's think about
1610080	1615120	what's going on in the Sudan or anything like that. But it was absolutely about, you know, like,
1615120	1620320	like, like, like if it was, it was good. It was a nice sandwich of like, there's a good accepted
1620320	1624720	speeches. Whatever you think about like, like these movies, whatever you think about this pageantry
1624720	1628720	and who know, like, like I'm on your side. If you think it's all a bunch of horseshit. However,
1629120	1635360	we, we, we all have this fantasy of, of, because we really do. And that's what propels this thing,
1635360	1641760	like this, this telecast, this idea, this idea that we're one day going to actually be called
1641760	1646400	up onto a stage and be given award and get to do this thing called an acceptance speech and that
1646400	1651280	we're going to either nail it or, or not nail it. Have you fantasized of it? You gave an Emmy
1651280	1654560	acceptance speech. Have you fantasized about it? Yeah. And I kind of harmed it. You know, like,
1655520	1658480	I, for those of you who don't know, I won an Emmy for writing the Oscars.
1662320	1670880	He wrote the whole Oscars. Yeah. Yeah. Never make the mistake of asking me if I've ever been to the
1670880	1675760	Oscars. Cause I'll get to say, Oh yeah. Yeah. I've been to the Oscars so much. I won an Emmy for it.
1678400	1683760	And my favorite thing about that is you saying like Dan went and he won an Oscar.
1683760	1689440	I won an Emmy for writing the opening to the Oscars for Hugh Jackman. And he accepted the
1689440	1696560	word and he said, my acceptance speech for the, the Emmy for writing the Oscars is nominated for a
1696560	1704000	Tony. Cause it's a live performance. People liked it a lot. If the governor's ball is any indication,
1704000	1707360	I had a lot of famous people coming up to me and going, you're fucking awesome. I was like,
1707600	1715600	thanks famous guy. I still got it. Or I now have it. I don't know. Anyways, I was, I don't know. I
1715600	1720000	don't know what we can do with this, but we, we obviously have a lot of like wonderful people
1720000	1726640	here and they all came here instead of watching the end of the Oscars. I, I, I, I, I don't know
1726640	1730880	how to turn this into a game or a contest or something, but I thought we could do something
1730880	1736640	where we could have people come up and, and I'm, and not try to be funny, like not try to be ironic,
1736640	1743920	but really actually try as hard as they can to give a real, like, like a really good acceptance
1743920	1750800	speech. What, what if you came up with categories and see if you named a category and see if somebody
1750800	1755680	would like to win the award for that category or ask somebody what category they would like to win.
1755680	1760080	Right. Ask them what I think. So we'll start with that. Like what, we'll ask people what category
1760080	1766400	they'd like to win an award for an Academy award and then we'll, yeah, right. Yeah, sure. Okay.
1766480	1771120	So let's go. We got our usual suspects up here. I don't think we should exclude them, but also
1772240	1776000	I don't know how to do this. How do you, how do you initiate this? I would say you open the
1776000	1779840	bidding with a certain category and start not with, not with the, like the big, you know,
1779840	1786240	five or six categories, maybe like, you know, best foreign feature animated. Do you think that's
1786240	1793200	someone's ambition? Does anybody here have a weird category that they, like, like other than best
1793200	1800720	actor? I almost feel like you have to foist it on people. Best, best boy. Sound design. You really
1800720	1806240	want to win for best sound design sometime. Okay. And the winner for best. Oh, wait, wait, wait,
1806240	1814000	okay. Well, let's give them a little bit of lead up. What's your name? Sam. Can I, can I get your
1814000	1821840	last name? Sam Botstein. Okay. Sam Botstein. So we'll, we'll, we'll make up some other nominees
1821840	1826960	and uh, okay. And then you're, so then you come up and like, really honestly, like your job isn't
1826960	1831600	to be funny if they're not laughing. Like, like, like, like, like honestly, just, just like really
1831600	1835920	from the heart, like what you think like a good acceptance speech would be. We're not going to,
1835920	1839680	yeah, that's it. That's, we're going to do a bunch of them and you'll be the first and you'll be,
1839680	1848480	you'll be great. Uh, all right. So, uh, so, uh, here presenting the, hello, uh, Jared Leto.
1848480	1856960	Hi. We're doing, we're doing the celebrity, celebrity manager. Who am I? Oh, hey, Dudley.
1860400	1861440	Dudley Moore's ghost.
1864000	1870960	Yes, it's good to not be dead. Uh, you know, Jared, I liked your speech earlier. It's very
1870960	1876880	interesting about your passage through your mother's birth canal. Thank you. Sound design is
1876880	1886240	a crap. Wait, what was it? Sound without sound design. Sound would be undesigned. I just made a
1886240	1892560	fart sound right there. But that fart sound was designed by some of the wizards, electricians,
1892560	1899840	and sorcerers. The nominees for best sound design in a motion picture are, uh, Franklin
1900240	1904240	Johansson for 1200 feet above the sea.

1971680	1976400	Yeah, you did it. And the winner and the winner for best sound design in a motion picture is,
1977360	1995600	oh, my God, Sam Botstein for plywood memories. Wow. Wow, it's really an honor to be chosen from
1995600	2002160	such amazing nominees, working on such amazing movies like space nugget. And, uh, um, you know,
2002240	2008560	I really have to thank everyone for giving me the opportunity to, um, work on this, uh, plywood
2008560	2015360	memories, plywood memories, um, you know, in a world where we're used to just hearing the same
2015360	2021280	thing over and over again, especially when you're watching something about plywood, um, you know,
2021280	2025920	it's just really an honor to, you know, have anyone trust me with their film about plywood
2025920	2031840	and just, you know, trust me to make it come to life. And, uh, thank you everyone for giving me
2031840	2036960	this opportunity and my parents, my mother and father, and everyone for really believing in me.
2036960	2042320	Thank you. Good night. It's good. You can keep, you know what? Keep it.
2047360	2052560	Let's do another one. Yeah. Mostly I think, I think we're going to delight in your, uh,
2054720	2059920	I don't want to overshadow with my amazing improv, but in your fake nominees,
2059920	2068320	but, uh, I may have a few, uh, surprises for us. Uh, all right. And now name a category. Like,
2069360	2073360	should we, should we open the, should we say, does anybody else want to, uh, like if they're pie in
2073360	2080160	the sky dream would be to win for a more like, I feel like we should make them up to a specific
2080160	2084240	category. Like, like, like, I want to know what, I want to know what beefcake, beefcake bill,
2084240	2091520	beefcake bill. He's gotten a beefcake. Yeah. He's endured a lot. He's beefcake bill now.
2091520	2093840	If we do enough shows, I'll end up as Spongebob bill.
2094720	2100000	Beefcake bill. What category would you dream of? It can be an existing one, but special effects.
2100000	2104640	Special effects. Okay. All right. Let's give them as due. All right. All right. Could you,
2104640	2108560	could you fantasize about giving an acceptance speech for a special effects award
2108560	2115360	against such illustrious nominees as, as well. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen,

2155840	2160080	the new season of, uh, true detective. Thank you.

2300080	2306080	We exploded every day on when working in, uh, for blue jeans and blue jeans and sex

2326400	2333040	I want to do one, like somebody, I want somebody to, uh, I wish there was a way to like randomly
2333040	2336560	just select people, but you can just point a finger at something. Well, but yeah, but I want
2336560	2340400	to make people, I don't want to abuse people by making them come up, but I want somebody to come
2340400	2345680	up and do like their, their version of the most controversial, like the one that everyone will
2345680	2351360	talk about the next day. Like, like, like, like, like, you know, the egregious speech. You went too
2351360	2357040	far. It could be like, you love me or you like me, you really like me, or it could be like, could be
2357040	2362480	anything political as a native American. Why don't we just have Adam Goldberg do that one?
2365840	2370560	Are you willing to do this, Adam? Assuming you're here. What, what, what award category would you,
2370560	2376640	would you like to win for? Adapted screenplay. Adapted screenplay. Okay. All right. Please,

2386480	2392160	Oh, I see. That's a nice, nice hat you got there. I,
2394720	2398880	the words we use are often less valuable than the ones we
2398960	2401200	use from other people that have used them.
2408080	2408880	You sure said it.
2414080	2416800	The nominees for best adopted screenplay.

2472640	2476480	You, you, you gotta give me your hands. I'm going to go into space.
2476480	2480640	But I, I have a kid who died. I shouldn't, I shouldn't have been on a NASA mission in
2480640	2485840	the first place. I'm an, I'm an emotional wreck. Also Hubble is way farther outside of, of, of
2485840	2490320	orbits than, than any other Russian satellite. This is, this scientifically makes no sense.
2492800	2496800	Axe grinder, the Jeff Davis story.
2501040	2508400	Gravity is not enjoyable. I demand that it adhere to my understanding of aeronautics.

2530560	2533040	How's the winner? And the winner. Wait a minute. Oh, sorry.
2534160	2535200	Axe grinder 3.
2538240	2543120	Plaster, plaster face. Uh, story from the spectrum.
2545920	2551280	Adapted from the novelization of his own work, Adam Goldberg. Uh,
2552240	2555920	do you see me? Do you understand who I am? You haven't won yet, motherfucker.
2558800	2559520	What does he know?
2561360	2565520	Oh, shit. Yeah. We have a guy who thinks he's already won. It's, uh, it's weird.
2565520	2569520	Motherfuckers coming up, storming the stage. What a weird thing to do to get up and think
2569520	2574160	you won the, the door to the ward already. Never wanted to control the contents of an
2574160	2578080	envelope more than my life. I kind of hope he doesn't win because he's already come up.
2578800	2583040	Bad news. Bad news. Uh-oh. You've already read the envelope? Yeah. It ain't personal. We
2583040	2586080	haven't even opened the envelope. You can see through the envelope with your laser eyes.
2586080	2592240	I know. Listen, I hang with, with Smith, Wesson and Price Waterhouse.
2593600	2597600	The makers of guns and manhays. Manhays?
2597680	2602640	I don't know. Shit, man. Who are you again? I'm Bill Murray. Bill Murray.
2604240	2611120	And you're Vincent Price, right? That's fucked up, man. All right. So all those people are
2611120	2616240	incredibly important in the work they do. Oh, they all adapted screenplays. Do you want to
2616240	2621520	recap the names of the films? Seasons of Winter, Plasterface, Space Dick.
2621760	2627840	Musterhouse 3, the adaptation of Musterhouse 4. Nugget Train. The, then the outstanding
2627840	2634800	nominee winner goes to, I heard about this motherfucker, but I've always wanted to work
2634800	2647440	with him, Adam Goldberg. I brought my own award. I have to tell people of the academy something,
2648400	2655360	which is that heavily, heavily plagiarized was my story from Plasterface.
2658960	2664880	I didn't see the king. I wasn't in the king and I. I'm not six foot three. Girlfriend is
2664880	2669760	a Scottish and I'm a loser. Guess what, America? I'm a loser and I won the award and you didn't.
2669760	2675760	You got to work tomorrow. I don't. I have an e-business. You're all probably poor and I don't
2675840	2681360	care what state you're in unless it's Massachusetts, Hawaii, in some parts of New York, but not New York
2681360	2699680	City. That went well. Well, I thought we fucked him over because our comedy went over. His job was
2699680	2705920	to do the most controversial, uh, acceptance speech. He got, you remember? Spike, Spike
2705920	2708720	Jones won best screenplay. We knew that Matthew McConaughey won best actor.
2711360	2724800	Best actor. Best actor. Best director gravity. Okay. Gravity. Yeah. Well shot. Well directed.
2724800	2734400	Bad story. Stupid and boring. Fuck it. Fuck it. Super duper dumb. All right. Stupid movie.
2734400	2740400	Stupid movie. You don't send, you don't send a crazy lady up who just recently had a child die.
2741280	2746080	You don't put her in charge of the goddamn Hubble fucking space telescope. It's not, it's not,
2746080	2751200	it's not, and George Clooney, he's fucking, look, I love George Clooney. He's great,
2751200	2755760	but so many accidents happen in that fucking movie. And then at the end when his toe is hanging
2755760	2761600	by a rope that accidentally tied around his foot and he's there and he's like, just let go. Just
2761600	2766160	let me just do it on your own. So at that point, there's so many fucking accidents that have
2766160	2770320	happened. Why not just say, fuck it, stick with me. I'm an accident lady and everything's gonna be
2770320	2775920	fine. And then she plummets to earth and she was not, she's not going to live and she lands 15
2775920	2783680	fucking feet from the fucking coastline. And where is she? Cancun? It's not bad weather. It's
2783680	2790800	gorgeous. 15 feet further inland, plunk into the sand, dead. 15 feet further out, eaten by a shark
2790800	2796800	because the seaweed almost killed her. She almost dies by seaweed at the end. Stupid. And then my
2796800	2802160	biggest beef with the whole fucking movie, forget all the bad science. She gets up and this is a
2802160	2806960	glamour shot from the toes up and he's standing there, perfectly shaved legs. She's been in space
2806960	2812880	as far as we're told for weeks and she just came back from fucking the waxing. That's Jeff's
2812880	2819200	biggest beef. Oh no, I've got bigger beef. Scientifically, her hair does not move in
2819200	2824320	outer space. Everything else moves. Everything else moves. Her hair doesn't move. Why? Hard to do.
2825280	2829360	Also, apparently hard to do, write some fucking dialogue or fucking dumb.
2831920	2836960	Oh, I had a dream that George Clooney, I am alive. I'm here again. I came back because the story is
2836960	2841120	only about a person that we don't care about that much. I'm about another person you don't care about
2841120	2846000	that much. I'm back. Oh, I woke up. Oh, he's not there anymore. Oh, my baby died. And she fucking
2846000	2854480	boo. Fuck that movie. Fuck it. Stupid movie. Also, if a thing blows up in orbit,
2857680	2860800	it's going to move in a bunch of different directions. The debris field does not move
2860800	2868560	counter to the fake orbit of Hubble, which is so far out in space that it's the farthest the fucking
2870000	2875520	space shuttle mission has ever gone. The Russian satellite's not going to come at it. So dumb.
2875600	2879120	And also, when the Russian guy, their Russian fucking counterpart gets a bullet through the
2879120	2883360	fucking helmet, and it's just his head, no, he would fucking disintegrate and evaporate in the
2883360	2887600	fucking space. He's just a Russian guy with a bullet in his head. Stupid. Fuck it. Dumb.
2888880	2895280	Make a movie about two people. Make a movie about two people who go to fix the Hubble space telescope
2896400	2902160	and make it, call it lost in fucking space, and then make a movie about two people who have to
2902160	2906960	actually go through what it's like to be lost in space. Don't bore the fuck out of me with,
2906960	2916720	oh, God, fuck it, everybody. Oh, my baby died. Really. I'm surprised a mission specialist was
2916720	2921920	allowed out of the fucking vehicle with that much emotional trauma. Fucking dumb.
2921920	2929200	All right, all right. Game of self is own music, kid.
2931200	2935040	I'm the winner for most self-righteous. Tyler, why don't you, let's let Tyler do
2935040	2940160	the honors. Come on up. This picture goes to 12 years of slave. No. All right, Dan,
2940160	2946480	want to weigh in on that one? We've got a slave man. Well, you guys booing? I don't want to shame
2946480	2952800	you for booing. At least I did not see, what was it called, American Hustle? Didn't see it.
2952800	2959600	American Hustle can go fuck itself. Gravity, as I said, can go fuck everything. Gravity
2959600	2963360	should not have beaten 12 years of slaves. Gravity can go figure out what angular momentum
2963360	2970160	is and have angular momentum fuck it up the fake space hole. Does anyone have a list of
2970160	2973920	the nominees? Can we go down and get the consensus of the crowd? What should have won?
2974880	2981520	Her was nominated, right? Yeah, let's let Tyler pull it up. He'll be our Oscar
2982400	2987680	curator. Get him a mic. It's very, very, very, very interesting though. I mean, I,
2988640	2991680	yeah, yeah. Could you come up and grab a mic so that we can, I don't have to,
2993600	2995520	yeah, so I don't have to move. Tyler, everybody.
2996480	3002560	Hi. All right. The list, the list of movies for were nominated for best picture were American
3002640	3013920	Hustle. Okay. Captain Phillips. All right. Yeah. Dallas Buyers Club. Gravity. Yeah. Her.
3015200	3020320	Good movie. Nebraska. I didn't see it. I didn't see it. She was nominated,
3020320	3026480	actress in that, the 84 year old lady. She was awesome. Philomena. Didn't see it. 12 years of
3026480	3033120	Slave and the Wolf of Wall Street. Oh yeah. I didn't see Nebraska or the other one. Uh,
3033120	3038320	I don't know, man. I saw 12 years of Slave. I didn't, I didn't see most of them. I thought
3038320	3042720	it was good, but not great. I thought, I thought it was a good film, but not like not a spectacular
3042720	3046960	film. But how good does it need? Why is Brad Pitt all of a sudden in the movie at the end?
3047920	3052320	That was very silly and egregious, but he was a producer on it and that helps get a movie made
3052320	3056560	in this day and age. It was, it wasn't the fucked up thing about that. Well, I, I'm curious to,
3056560	3063920	I want to read that guy's actual memoirs because is there a, is there an angelic, like handsome,
3063920	3068000	like a guy from some guy. It's just like all of a sudden after all of this betrayal
3068000	3073200	and you knew when the guy from Deadwood is like in the barracks, I'm like, Oh, he's from Deadwood.
3073200	3078320	Don't like, like he, he played two different guys in Deadwood and they're all bad guys. Like,
3078640	3083200	don't trust him. He's white. He's white. Don't get out of there. Uh, it's such a heartbreaker.
3083200	3087520	Like it's so funny watching that movie in bed while you're eating fucking hot wings and
3087520	3093120	things like just the thing, like Aaron, Aaron's comments included, uh, this guy can't get a break.
3097440	3102480	And my 12 years, no breaks. And my personal favorite, which I'd actually like to talk about,
3102480	3107520	which is like after watching a little bit of fast bender in his ways, this guy loves having
3107520	3112800	slaves, which is, which is actually important to talk about because that was, uh, I think that's
3112800	3117200	why that movie was very interesting. Um, I don't know if it's because of how it was written or
3117200	3122560	directed or, or act as certainly the actors are doing a fantastic job. Another question we both
3122560	3127200	had while watching it is what is it? What is that set like when they call it cut? What the fuck
3127200	3132560	happens when you call it cut on a set like that? What I unlike any other set, like what the fuck
3132560	3136960	do you do? I mean, it's probably not a spoiler. Maybe everybody's seen it, but the, uh, well,
3136960	3145360	slavery is abolished. Eventually slavery loses. But the, uh, the lashing scene when he, when,
3145360	3151120	when, when she gets, when she gets lash and like the most, most movies in my experience, like,
3151120	3156240	like Denzel and the glory, when he's getting lashes, usually the camera's facing the person
3156240	3162240	getting, like getting whipped. Yeah. And, and there's a lot of like horrible, I think for no
3162240	3165920	other reason, when they, when they, when they, when they turn the camera around and the, uh, the
3165920	3173680	effects that the most brutal, the most brutal visuals weren't the CG flesh openings on the
3173680	3181520	ends of the whip, but actually right before that, the aerosol mist of blood coming off of backs.
3182320	3188880	The, the, the, the thing that was most striking to me about that movie, which has nothing to do with
3188880	3193840	how it was written, directed, acted, whatever. But the important thing that sunk into my 41
3193840	3202400	year old brain about American slavery, which was fucking a minute ago, uh, was it was commercial
3202400	3208400	and on top of it, it was like untenable that it was, it was so psychotic, the whole thing. Like
3208400	3215680	every character in that movie is protesting too much. And like, I always, my, my image as a child
3215760	3221440	of the seventies is always a guy in a horse with a whip, having the time of his life while a bunch
3221440	3226720	of people ruthlessly, like, you know, just do things that machines will one day be able to do.
3227280	3233280	Uh, and, and it's horrible and they, but the, the, the, the psychology of all of it, it was like,
3233280	3237920	I kept, I kept thinking throughout the entire movie, like, uh, Jesus Christ, who the fuck
3237920	3242560	thought this was a good idea? Like everybody that's doing it, the people that are profiting
3242560	3248480	the most are all tangled up in it. Like they, they really need to say things to themselves
3248480	3252880	and to each other over and over and over again to make this all right. And more importantly,
3252880	3259680	like the, the emphasis on commerce, the idea of debt, the idea that this person, it wasn't just
3259680	3266880	a choice between is this right or is this wrong? Because we as a 25 year old hipsters, uh, we all
3266880	3273280	go, well, the fuck's fun about having a slave. That's not cool. That's not cool. I didn't see any
3273280	3277200	of the nominated films, but as far as that's concerned, was there a dissenting voice at all
3277200	3281360	among in the movie at all among the people who were like, just keep your head down. Don't do this.
3281360	3285840	Was there any sort of, what was everybody? What do you mean? Like, like, amongst, amongst the,
3285840	3289840	the titular slaves in the film, were there any, what are any of them? There's people saying like,
3289840	3294800	like, keep your head down. Like it's, it's, it's easier. Well, they tell the guy, you can't forget,
3294800	3298720	you know how to read or write. Yeah. He can't even, you don't tell anybody that you're literate
3298720	3303520	because you'll actually end up getting killed, which is a terrifying belly of the whale realization
3303520	3309200	that he actually, the, the key to his freedom that he thought was actually in his hand that,
3309200	3313520	that he thought couldn't be taken away from him. That doesn't mean anything compared to the color
3313520	3318240	of his skin or the circumstances in which he was born. So, so in fact, the fact that he's literate
3318240	3323520	actually puts him in great peril. Uh, and, and he walks this weird tightrope between it. The,
3324000	3328880	but the amazing, like, like, like, I, I just, I was blown away by, oh shit, this was commerce.
3328880	3335760	This was buying a Snickers bar. This was, this was the people kept saying, I owe the, the Shawshank
3335760	3344880	farm. I owe them 50 redemptions. I have to, I, my crops aren't, it's the emphasis on capitalism
3344880	3349520	because that's what it fucking is. And that's the thing. Like we, we pat ourselves on the back so
3349520	3357600	much for like outgrowing this concept, but it's not, it's just, it's just barbarism combined with
3358160	3363920	rampant capitalism. If you, if you, if you're allowed to, you will abuse people. There were,
3363920	3369600	there, I, I, I, I, this move is nothing to do with the movie, but I, I experienced that epiphany
3369600	3374240	while watching the movie, even though I, I thought I understood that we had slavery and what that meant
3374240	3379440	and why I should feel bad about it. And I, but I, I kind of didn't. And that, and that movie made
3379440	3383760	me kind of think about it on a different level. Yeah. I sort of get where you're coming from in,
3383760	3388720	in that, I mean, the, the stakes are different, but sort of the, the, the capitalism involved in
3388720	3394320	the machine is no different than what it is now. Except I, do you think that people at some one of
3394320	3398240	them went to the numbers and went, if we know actually pay these people and give them wages,
3398240	3402400	they'll last longer. I'm sure that's one of the time there was a cost analysis done when,
3402400	3406880	wait, we can make more money and these are, you know, our slaves or our, our people working for
3406880	3412400	us will last longer if we help them kind of along with, you know, we don't have to keep the bottom
3412400	3416960	line. It doesn't go up that much. More importantly, if you were allowed to, if the law said that you
3416960	3423280	were allowed to, as, as the, as the superhuman Amish Brad Pitt, who comes in at the end of the,
3423280	3427920	at the end of the story comes in with this message and says to this character,
3427920	3435440	if, if tomorrow the law said that I was allowed to treat you this way, would that make it right?
3435440	3440960	And he can't, he can't wrap his brain around it because it's so, it's so based on hatred.
3440960	3446800	I, I, I just, the, I was stricken by the amount of work. I don't know how much of it is based
3446800	3452800	on reality, but the amount of work that went into, for instance, taking a lantern and going out to
3452800	3457280	your slave hut and having all of your slaves come into your house and do a dance for you,
3457600	3462880	that seems so much harder than just having slaves. There's so, so much work. I would like,
3462880	3467600	it was insane how fucking like what there was, there wasn't about saving work. He had a lot of
3467600	3473280	free time. Come in, come in, come in the house. Everybody dance, come dance. Then they're doing
3473280	3479200	a dance. The dance has to be taught to them. You have to have a choreographer teach everybody. And
3479200	3483280	then there's all this anger that you're fucking that slave. Oh, I'm not fucking that slave. I'm
3483280	3486480	going to throw a vase at her. It's like, like Jesus Christ, they put a lot of work into having
3486480	3492320	slaves, these people. All right. Anyways, uh, it was, I thought it was a good movie. I, I, I, I,
3492320	3498400	I think it's really interesting. Like my first, my first thought as everyone's is, is, oh, well,
3498400	3504560	if you make a movie set in this world, you're not allowed to not be nominated for an Oscar,
3504560	3509920	much less win one perhaps. But I think it's, but I think it's interesting. Yes, of course.
3509920	3514080	But I think it's very interesting at what you do with that thought. Do you then like,
3514080	3518720	but you've, if you go to Rotten Tomatoes and you look at the scores and you sort them by lowest to
3518720	3524720	highest, like the people that I, I, out of morbid curiosity, I went and looked at the reviews of
3524720	3531600	that movie. Like what are, what are the big detractors of this movie's, uh, prestige saying?
3531600	3538720	And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's very strange. I, I saw, I saw a guy with a one star review of
3538720	3547200	the movie saying, this is, this is pornography for racists and softhearted lemmings. And I don't,
3547200	3550320	I don't know if that's the most profound thing in the world you could ever say, or the most
3550320	3554960	idiotic. I don't know what that is. I think that person is generally saying, oh, this is,
3554960	3559360	this is race bait. I don't know. I guess if you were trying to, if you were to endow that person
3559360	3563520	with an IQ, that's what they would be saying. I'd have to watch it again. It's just, it's just
3563520	3567680	a clinically shot fucking exploration. It's an adaptation of the memoir. It doesn't, the,
3567760	3572240	the camera doesn't push down a bar while the Rolling Stones play. It's not anybody here.
3572240	3575920	First of all, black or feel strongly about that film. Like for, for better, for worse. Anybody
3575920	3580960	here? We don't have, there's no black people that come to this podcast. Where's NT when we need him?
3580960	3585120	Oh, he's, he's having an Oscar party. Are you kidding me? Tonight's his night, man.
3586560	3592240	Uh, the, I, I, yeah, I just think, I just think it's weird. Like, like, like the conversation
3592240	3601360	that you have between somebody that would bother to insist that that movie not be regarded well,
3601360	3606720	like at least, at least a film that, that deals with important stuff, like an actual
3606720	3611440	like heavy matter, like wins and not some of the pitfall that was nominated. Like,
3611440	3617200	yeah, I'd rather, it's the only movie that's about class systems. It's, it's the only movie.
3617200	3621360	Why aren't the other movies, why aren't the other movies dealing with the fact that there are poor
3621360	3624800	people being told what to do by rich people? Isn't, isn't that sort of the point of the Oscar
3624800	3629200	bait movie though, is to sort of specifically go for the things that are the hot button issues? Not
3629200	3633520	to say that they did it just for the purpose of the Oscar bait, but that's sort of what that's,
3633520	3637920	that's film's wheelhouse is you want to kind of tackle big issues and bring to light it, you know,
3637920	3641840	things like that. What was the film? I'm really ignorant about it. The, uh, the documentary about
3641840	3648320	Egypt and the, uh, the, uh, did that, did that win? No, no. What, what, oh, the act of killing
3648320	3654080	didn't win 20 feet from 20, 20 feet from the start of one. Yeah. There are a lot of, a lot of
3654080	3660000	great documentaries. All the time was a good day. The 23rd start was great, but I'm sorry. I, I,
3660000	3666400	the act of killing is I, I, I, I, I just, I, I threw a shoe at the TV. I, I, I, how,
3667360	3673040	give, give, give 20 feet from stardom, remake it next year. It's two hours of people saying over
3673040	3677200	and over again that it's hard to be a backup singer. I'm sorry. It's the act of killing is
3677200	3682640	a fucking exploration of, of, of the definition of good and evil and the human condition and our
3682640	3688960	capacity to lie to ourselves and each other. 20 feet from stardom is fun. During an acceptance
3688960	3692400	speech for 20 feet of stardom, they brought one of the backup singer speech and the last half of the
3692400	3696640	acceptance speech was her singing about how happy she was. Yeah, she kept saying it. Yeah. I don't
3696640	3700800	want to take anything away from, no, I mean, it was a good documentary. Yeah. It was fine. All
3700800	3704720	of those documentaries were great. I think I saw most of them, but boy God, the act of killing,
3704720	3708000	I felt like I wanted to run out to the street and say, this is the most important film I've
3708000	3712400	ever seen in my life because it's, it's, it's beyond Indonesia. It's beyond, it's beyond
3712400	3718960	killing. It's, it's, it goes into like, what the fuck? Who are we? We are insane. We are insane.
3718960	3726320	We are a species of fucking liars and, and, and, and just like we, we swallow it down and it comes
3726320	3735280	up through vomit. You come to the point of the, you know, strong issues documentary versus the
3735280	3738800	interesting thing documentary. It's like, is, I don't think that necessarily one is patently
3738800	3743600	better than the other. Did you, you saw both of them. Did you think that the, the, the, the, the
3743600	3747200	square was patently a better, I didn't see the square. I didn't see it. Okay.
3748160	3752240	Uh, someone's raising your hand. That's always good. What's your name?
3760640	3763760	Strike one. He said, I'm not black.
3766400	3772560	But isn't 12 years of slave pornographic? Like wouldn't you agree with that?
3773520	3778880	Grab a mic and come on stage. Sam or if you want to, if you want to get over Sam,
3778880	3782400	then we can hear you. If we have to proceed, then we can, we can hear you for the podcast.
3782400	3788160	Oh yeah. Take, taking the very difficult position of, yeah, it would be easy to say,
3788160	3791600	okay, 12 years of slave is a great movie, but you're saying like intellectually.
3791600	3795360	Yeah. It's just, I mean, slavery is pretty bad, but
3795360	3806000	but showing how bad it is. Yeah. It's, I mean, that was the for me was the most
3808160	3813360	like the, the, the, the bad stuff, the pornographic stuff was the stuff that was like,
3813360	3820480	oh shit, this is really good. But other than that, that's it. That's like, it's, I mean,
3820480	3825600	that's like in Korea, like you, you put a film about the Korean war and like
3825600	3830320	North Korea and the shit that North Korea is doing that's going to win the equivalent of
3830320	3836400	the Korean Oscars, which is what, by the way, I want to know. It's called the squeegee.
3839280	3843520	It doesn't, it doesn't, are you, I'm sorry. Was it racist for me to assume you knew?
3847120	3849760	Sam, are you Korean? Yeah.
3850800	3853280	It was a bad movie. But did you, how old are you? Can I ask,
3853280	3856080	you seem young enough. I can ask how old you are. That's racism. Third day.
3859120	3866560	All right. Yes. No, because congratulations. Thank you. American hustle talked about class
3866560	3872240	in a way. I mean, it wasn't the house. Speaking of class, somebody in the crowd went.
3874880	3879440	Did you talk about black people better than I think 12 years of slave because I feel like it was
3880640	3885440	a, okay. I think I understand the point he's trying to make in that, in that a lot of these
3885440	3890240	films that are these sort of the ones that are going after the heavy issues choose to
3890240	3895920	depict these scenes that are very real, that were actual parts of, of, you know, violent parts of
3895920	3900560	our history, you know, dark parts of our history, just to sort of, to get the reaction of people,
3900560	3904720	to, to get them to think this is something we need to consider. This is something we need to
3904720	3908560	think about. And that I would say, I would say that that's sort of the point of those films,
3908560	3911760	isn't it? I sort of, I think of a lot of the films in the past, like they show those scenes
3911760	3916800	that are uncomfortable for the purpose of like getting the viewer to sort of think about it and
3916800	3923840	go, look, but Django did a better job of that. But Django obviously is like cartoon. Yeah. It
3923840	3928160	takes place in a mythical universe. That's the danger. I think that, I mean, you're 30, I'm 41.
3928160	3934480	I think that when I think about the concept of slavery in America and the fact that the
3934480	3938320	country's built on it and all this stuff, it's like, this is, this is right back around the corner, but
3938400	3943680	the fact that I'm able to actually like in a post roots, post fucking everything world,
3943680	3951360	like I was raised in the 70s on an awareness of, of this shit. And yet I, when I watched that movie,
3951360	3957600	I'm still, I, there is something about the aerosol mist of blood coming off of someone's back
3957600	3964400	that I didn't receive through the movie glory with Matthew Broderick. I didn't, I didn't, I, I
3964400	3970960	needed to, I needed to be brutalized. I needed to watch more pornography about slavery. I did. I
3970960	3974880	don't know if that makes it a good movie or not, but I don't, I don't know. It doesn't make a best
3974880	3978800	picture though. I, but compared to these other ones, I'm not sure. I didn't see two of them,
3978800	3983680	but I'm not sure. Yeah. I don't know. I thought, I mean, the guy's putting the camera in the right
3983680	3988880	places as far as I'm concerned. He didn't do anything like, you know, yeah. I mean, it wasn't,
3988880	3993760	it wasn't like, holy shit. What a, what a rock star. Is that the point is that some of these
3993760	3998640	films then, like I was saying, to use that depiction, uh, like to, to sort of jog the,
3998640	4002960	oh wait, this is something I need to pay attention to. So to, so they can get their message across
4002960	4006480	that sort of seems to be a common theme. But with that hot button going around you,
4006480	4010400	if you show up to that set and you put your styrofoam cup of coffee down and you're ready to
4010400	4015280	do the scene with fast bender and these other actors, uh, pick up the whip. Okay. All right.
4015280	4018400	This scene, you're going to do this and that. Isn't that a good director? Isn't that a good
4018400	4025440	movie? If, if, if, if those people are, but Jango, he should have won. But Jango, it's a comic book.
4025440	4032480	Jango's, Jango's just silly and gross. Like, I, like that, that, that, that, that, that, that
4032480	4036480	comic book idea of the, of the big, well, I think this comes down, but this comes into a very
4036480	4043120	interesting concept because it, it, it creates a dichotomy between good movie versus these things
4043120	4047840	that often the Oscars are celebrating, which is good and conscientious. For me, if you're going to
4047840	4052880	be conscientious and make important films, uh, like not documentaries, but like, but, but
4052880	4057360	fictional or in this case, you know, an adaptation of a real memoir, like, like really, like serious,
4057360	4062160	heavy stuff, like for me, and I'd have to watch it again to talk intelligently about it. I just
4062160	4067040	feel like it missed for me in some ways. And I don't know what it was Jango or no, no, fuck Jango,
4067040	4072960	the, uh, 12 years a slave and, and, and, and, and like lots of films, like they, they, you can deal
4072960	4078560	with, uh, heavy stuff, but I, I don't think it elevates itself to the, to the level of like,
4078560	4084800	like artistic, like, like achievement in film. Like, uh, uh, even if, even if 12 years a slave
4084800	4089040	was a really good adaptation of that, of that memoir, which I've not read, which I'm hoping
4089040	4094000	and assuming is, is, you know, riveting and better. Um, I think it misses on certain levels
4094000	4099360	of like, in terms of making a great film. Um, but then what are we replacing it with frozen?
4100160	4105120	Exactly. What's, what is a good movie? Forrest Gump? What the fuck? Yeah. What are we talking
4105120	4109920	about? I don't know. I mean, like, like, like these movies that win every year and the notable
4109920	4113680	exception is the category of best screenplay, which I truly feel. But now the question is like, like,
4113680	4118480	like what, you know, her, I thought was, it was, it was a pretty moving, important movie. I don't,
4118480	4124640	I don't know that that's best picture material either, but like, would it, would it film that
4124640	4128880	one best picture? Like some of the great ones of all time, like what an all about Eve or what a
4128960	4134400	Casablanca be recognized as even a movie anymore. Like would people see it? Would people recognize
4134400	4139040	it? Would the academy look at it? Um, like, yeah, I don't know what their job is anymore. I mean,
4139040	4143600	it's an institution. It's this idea of this like prestigious thing. They did this thing tonight
4143600	4149040	where they paraded out these, this Benetton kids where they were like, they called them team Oscar
4149040	4155120	or something. Did you see what I'm talking about? They had like a decidedly multicultural,
4155680	4161040	multi-ethnic, like group of 25 year old kids, 20 year old kids that they, they taught. I didn't
4161040	4164400	even understand what it was. So there was like during a dub soap commercial, they started teeing
4164400	4168880	it up. And then, and then during this Oscars, they brought them out. There was like seven kids. They
4168880	4172800	were like helping with the production or something. I was, I was at the, the kind of gesture to them.
4172800	4177520	It was such, such, such proud of station. It was like, we're not, we're not an oligarchy. Look,
4177520	4183040	look at this, look at this band of, of proletariat. No, it was weird. It was like, it was like two,
4183040	4187200	during the pre-show was like these two, the two old white producers who throw the Oscars being
4187200	4190720	like talking to all these people over webcam, like we're going to have you and pick you and
4190720	4194320	pick you. And you're working on the Oscars. Yeah. And they showed, they showed them like crying.
4194320	4199040	Yeah. Like, Oh my God, I'm on Skype. And the Oscars want me to be relevant by being on
4199040	4202880	broadcast television, which gets less viewers than the YouTube guy who does the history of dance.
4203760	4208160	Also, this podcast will air after everybody's seen the Oscars and heard about the results
4208160	4211440	and people here clearly don't give a fuck cause they're here instead of being out watching.
4212400	4218960	Uh, so hooray for us, first off, uh, for not giving a shit about, uh, fake pageantry or, or just,
4218960	4230480	or a pageantry, which is fake. Uh, but, uh, sorry, really uncomfortable speech about how Palestine
4230480	4238160	shouldn't be a state. I know that. Look, I don't know. I just like, I think the bummer is that
4238240	4242240	none of us clearly here have a real horse in the race and we don't feel like nobody feels,
4242240	4246560	you're right. I went to a wrong path. A great, a great movie. One more. A great movie lost. I,
4246560	4251040	I just, I feel like it's just a case of a bunch of movies that nobody gives much of his shit about.
4251040	4255360	We're all in the running for a prize. That means nothing when the Victor doesn't like who gives a
4255360	4259920	fuck. You're right. I shouldn't, I shouldn't have mentioned him. I shouldn't have mentioned that.
4260720	4267760	I don't know. I mean, Harold Ramis is dead. If, if, if, if, if, if, if Caddyshack
4267760	4271760	rep against these movies, fucking Caddyshack, man, that's a great movie. That movie stinks.
4272960	4281280	Caddyshack sucks. God bless you, Harold. You know Caddyshack sucks. That's a shitty movie.
4283120	4287360	Everybody who has a line for that movie memorizes a fratty fucking fuckface.
4288160	4294800	Caddyshack is dead funny, man. It's dead. Nope. Yes. Noop. Noop. That's just,
4294800	4302880	Caddyshack is like a weird fucking Bible for fratty fuckfaces. No. It's garbage. So what,
4302880	4308880	so let's get laid. Rodney Dangerfield is wearing plaid pants. Sounds great. Sounds like a great
4308880	4318080	movie. It's, it's, it's a string of fucking like couplets. Do you like meatballs? I do love
4318080	4323680	meatballs. Caddyshack is better than meatballs. But, but, but, but, but I have the courage to
4323680	4328480	acknowledge that meatballs is not a good movie. Caddyshack is fucking funny. What was your name
4328480	4334560	again, sir? Sorry, was Scott? Sam. Sam. Let's, let's let Sam accept an award before he sits down.
4334560	4338560	Let's give Sam an award. Sam, do you want to pick a category or do you want us to foist one

4597280	4600560	The nominees for best costume design are
4604080	4612720	some Victorians, uh, sunsets by Leo and Mario and Sanjay Pute.

4626160	4633280	Extra. Would you like a paper, sir? I couldn't possibly think of it. My double-fested jackets too.
4634320	4638400	Fested. Sonya fuckface and Tony who gives a shit for gravity.
4642560	4645840	I can't move in the suit. Oh, hold on to my leg.
4647040	4649840	The stakes have never been higher. Jeff Davis is watching.
4655920	4662240	He's got a notepad and a fucking like trapper keeper with a rocket ship on it out.
4662240	4666720	Jesus Christ, who would have ever thought? It's a bad movie.

4680800	4686720	Tyler Giffen. Get this canal moving. I'm British. I've got a pith helmet on and I've got to make
4686720	4692720	it to the dance. I'm a masquerade person. That's a lot of costumes, isn't it? Just imagine a lot of
4692720	4709920	costumes. And the... Tyler Giffen! Oh, thank you very much. Wow. You know, when I came in,
4709920	4714880	the first thing I wanted to say, wow, I'm all over the place. Thank you guys.
4714880	4718960	It's really great to be here. It's my first time being here. There's a lot of people here.
4718960	4724400	That's a little uncomfortable. I just wanted to say that when we were in England, we noticed that
4724400	4728560	a lot of people were wearing clothes, lots of clothes. So we thought if we could put as many
4728560	4733360	clothes as possible on these people, that I think that would well represent the era. So we just
4733360	4739040	kept putting clothes on people until we couldn't actually see the actors anymore. And it worked.
4739040	4751600	Thank you. Thank you very much. Music is an important part of the cinema landscape.
4753120	4761760	Every movie has a song and every movie with a song has a song in it. Here, presenting all of

4774480	4777680	in a beautiful homage to all of the songs.
4791760	4798720	The American hustle. What else?

4806560	4810240	in the 12 years of slave and gravity.
4812880	4818480	Here presenting the best critique of that presentation is Kumail Nanjiani.
4821760	4831280	Hello, hello, geez, did you get here by bus? Huh? Jesus Christ, where were you?
4832000	4837840	Dying up here. Oh, was it? No, I was just complimenting him saying we missed you.
4837840	4843680	Oh, no, I ran soon as the Oscars were over. I wanted to see. Well, some of us came before
4843680	4849200	they were over. Yeah, I'm here to tell you, you can have your cake and eat it too. You could do
4849200	4854800	both. You don't have to choose. You could do both. Well, yeah, you can record it. Here's a
4854800	4858800	highlight from the Oscars that Aaron notified me of Matthew McConaughey while accepting his award.
4860000	4867200	Said his hero was him 10 years older. Yeah. No, I didn't get that right. It makes perfect sense.
4868240	4874560	Like who's your hero? Me. Have you seen me? First of all, why did he think that then was a time
4874560	4879760	to answer that question? Yeah. You're accepting a word. You're not being interviewed. He liked that
4879760	4883680	philosophy so much that he was like tearing up talking about how he's his own hero.
4884720	4889600	That was his acceptance pitch? Yeah, he won best actor. Good heavens. Where were we fucking
4889600	4895360	gone as a people? Well, but kind of he's fucking rocking it. He's on fire. If you, if you say
4895360	4903200	McConaughey sounds, I'm gonna fucking stab everybody. You know, we're in the middle of a
4903360	4909040	McConaughey. Speaking of McConaughey, Camille, I watched two and a half episodes of fucking True
4909040	4913840	Detective because of you. You don't like it? Two and a half episodes in, I don't know yet.
4913840	4918000	I don't know that I would continue watching if everyone I keep watching, it gets good.
4918560	4923920	It's the best show on TV. Okay. You know why? Because we're in the middle of a fucking
4923920	4931200	McConaughey. Yeah, it's a reconnaissance. It's a McConaughey. Matthew. It's not Matthew
4931280	4940960	reconnaissance. Matthew McConaughey. Matthew McConaughey. Matthew McConaughey is quite good
4940960	4946080	in that show. Woody Harrelson can go fuck himself with a dumb accent. My girlfriend and I were
4946080	4954080	watching it and we actually were Googling, uh, Woody Harrelson jaw injury? Woody Harrelson car
4954080	4961920	accident? Like, why is he? I was making fun of your, uh, can I ask you a question? That's pretty
4961920	4967760	good. You're the mistake of the award. You're right. I'd make a situations about the way I speak on
4967760	4973040	camera. Okay. Can I be, can I be McConaughey or McConaughey as you go? I don't know. Can you? Yes.
4974800	4979040	Let's do a scene. I've only seen two and a half episodes of, uh, of True Detective. Let's do a
4979040	4984080	scene where we're in a, we're driving in a car. Oh, that is how they drive. Like, like children.
4986240	4989200	All right. For the podcast listeners, I was driving like a normal person.
4990160	4995040	Left, right, left, right, left, right. That's the street you're on. Oh, wavy road.
4996560	5001440	So I'm assuming we're, we just, we're at the scene of a murder. If you, if you like. And now we're
5001440	5006960	going to another murder. Okay. So I'm going to do my best Matthew Rick McConaughey and you do your
5007040	5011280	Woody Harrelson scene. And if you're going from a murder to another murder, you're between murder.
5011280	5015040	Camille, you, you, you love the show. Direct this and give us a scene. Like, like, like,
5015040	5018960	tell us what's going on in the scene and we'll, we'll, we'll portray that scene. Okay. You have
5018960	5023840	just seen some horrific shit and you're, you're, you're, you're McConaughey. Okay. So you're a little
5023840	5030480	shaken by it. And he's like, this is what it's about. This is how, like, this is how life is,
5030560	5037120	you know? Yeah. I'm driving, right? I'm driving. Yeah, you're driving.
5044320	5046080	He does have permanent duck face.
5046080	5053920	I don't know what kind of sick son of a bitch does something like that.
5062960	5064720	You saw two and a half episodes.
5066240	5069920	Speak up motherfucker. There's mumble town, mumble towns.
5069920	5073200	All right. Wait, no mumbles. That's not fair.
5073280	5077520	You be Woody Harrelson and Kumail be McConaughey. You guys, you guys like to show.
5077520	5083040	I want, I want Kumail to be McConaughey. No, I can't do it. I can't do an accent. All right.
5083040	5094560	I'll do it, but I can't do a, this is the one I can do. I can't do his. I'm locked into this one,
5094560	5100960	man. You think I got a choice about this shit? If I could talk like McConaughey, wouldn't I talk
5101040	5109760	like McConaughey all the time? All right. I can't do an accent. Be Matthew Pakistani.
5112800	5118320	All right. So you want to be McConaughey or Woody Harrelson? Well, Woody Harrelson is unimpeachable.
5118320	5124160	I don't know. Well, I guess their silence was deference. Yeah. I don't know. Silence is consensus.
5124160	5133200	Okay. You were the silent ones. You consented to what's about to happen. That's all I'm saying.
5133200	5137760	I think they heard the word consent and assumed that that meant that said people want to be raped
5137760	5144000	or I don't know what. That's on you. Silence is consent is a phrase. It's an actual, your own
5144000	5150640	weird fetishism perversions. All right. I'll be Woody Harrelson. Okay. Are you going to be
5150800	5156960	McConaughey? Do you need time? Do you want to? No, I could go. But you set the scene. Okay. You just
5156960	5167280	left a shack and there's another little dream catcher weird wicker statue thing. And the audience
5167280	5170480	will probably wonder who gives a shit, but you guys are going to explain why we should give a
5170480	5178000	shit about more dream catcher wicker statues. Okay. Also, you're in a car and you're driving
5178000	5183600	really hard, like steering wheel. Okay. He's driving hard. Yeah. I don't drive. I look out.
5183600	5195760	I look out. Yeah. You're going to Matthew. Yes. Look, look, I want, guys, can we hold the roll?
5195760	5200400	Can we keep rolling? Keep rolling. I was one word with the actors. Matthew, I want you to look
5200400	5207120	vacantly into the middle distance. And, uh, Woody, Woody, I want you to mumble and overact
5207120	5216560	with your face and lips. So do what you do. Do your thing, would
5216560	5244640	you? And action. Sorry, that's my bad. That's my bad. And cut. Okay, good.
5246560	5253120	Let's, uh, moving on. We're moving on. Okay. Let's just, let's just turn it around. Reverse
5253120	5262240	angle. Same scene. Reverse angle. Okay. Just do the same thing. Woody, I want you to mumble
5262240	5269200	and overact. Uh, uh, but gonna hate. Do your thing. You ain't got no notes. Pardon me. What?
5269200	5276720	Notes? Sorry, I can't speak up. And action. Notes? Sorry, that's my bad.
5278960	5283920	What kind of sick son of a bitch tics a little girl puts his dick in her butt
5287280	5291360	and puts antlers on her hand and leaves her in the middle of a swimming pool?
5291360	5296160	You know, uh, we never looked at the girl's butt.
5299920	5302560	Oh, excuse me. If you have some kind of
5302560	5308880	assertation about the way I conduct my business, I consider you keep it to your goddamn self.
5308880	5321360	Can I tell you something? Yeah. What is it? I would like you to shut the fuck up.
5323200	5328960	I really haven't spoken very much. Keep, keep rolling. Keep rolling. This is the, this is the
5328960	5332560	monologue. This is the big Woody Harrelson monologue. But if you want to go off book,
5332560	5338480	off script, just do your Woody thing and give me the full Woody Harrelson take on life. Yeah.
5338560	5342000	Whatever your character, what's your character's name? Flash Gordon, Rusty McTavish,
5343200	5348160	Scoopy McDoubles. It's Marty, right? Marty. All right. Marty. I think it's Marty, right?
5348800	5354960	Yeah. And I'm gonna just like sort of scoff at his philosophy without really saying it. Okay.
5354960	5357200	And that's good because your monologue is right after his. Okay.
5359760	5362560	Tell you, there's a big world full of pussy out there.
5362560	5370480	There's three different kinds. The kind that gives you a highway, kind of gives you a byway.
5372560	5380880	The third kind, that's the kind you want. It's the rest stop. That's where you get love.
5380880	5390960	Love don't exist.
5396320	5403680	It's a mistake, man-made. Now hold on a second. You telling me love don't exist?
5404400	5407200	You finding any science textbook you ever read?
5409600	5414720	I don't know if you've ever read a book, but if you had, you might find
5415440	5422080	it's not on the periodic table of elements, so to speak.
5422080	5434000	Well, I got a problem with the way you talk to me. You got a certain condescension about you,
5435120	5441920	certain airs you take with me that I won't abide. Do me a favor. Sorry. No, go ahead.
5442960	5446720	No, I want to respect you because clearly that's an issue here.
5447680	5453120	Listen, the only issues I have are women, dick, pussy.
5456640	5458960	You could collapse two of those if you're the same.
5466000	5472000	I'm not condescending. Seems to me like- I was going to explain why I'm condescending,
5472080	5473440	but I don't think you'd understand.
5477760	5482160	Seems to me like this killer is doing things because he's some kind of pervert.
5485200	5488640	He's not a pervert, Marty. If anything, he's a messiah.
5491360	5495840	At least that's how he sees himself. This wasn't about sex.
5495840	5502160	Oh, excuse me for missing the part of the Bible where Jesus come down from the cross
5502160	5508720	and diddle a little girl with a corncob. I don't want to be weird, but right now
5508720	5514960	it looks like you're milking two cows. Don't question my space work.
5517200	5523920	Graduated third level UCB. I got a giant steering wheel in my hand.
5524640	5529120	Later. You two, get in my office now. I want some movement on this case,
5529120	5532000	so I'm going to get some professionals in here to solve these murders.
5532000	5536080	How are these two murders even related? Why are we following you around one murder and then
5536080	5541440	another murder and you guys seem to have no leads at all. For two and a half episodes, no leads at
5541440	5547760	all. I'll tell you something. We're six episodes in now and we still don't got no leads.
5547760	5556160	If I was, you put your spoilers on your badge and your gun on my desk right now.
5556160	5558000	Literally the opposite of a spoiler.
5562880	5570240	So nothing happens in that show? Oh, stuff happens. They're just terrible policemen.
5571200	5575920	One guy's really good at being a policeman, but terrible at like not doing drugs.
5575920	5580000	One more question for both of you before I kick you out of my office. Oh, okay. And this time
5580000	5590240	for good. Why is it in Texas when we see all sorts of weird shit where every other cop in the
5590240	5595680	bullpen and every other actor standing behind you and everybody, every extra in this seems to look
5595680	5601840	more like a policeman than both of you two. What makes you think you can be this good looking and
5601840	5608800	mumble that much? I look like a policeman who had to lose a lot of weight for a role in Hollywood
5608800	5616320	and has just gained a little bit of it back. What role was that? Dallas Buyers Club. Oh, I'm sorry.
5617280	5627840	I love that movie. You're back on the case. Woody, I loved you on Cheers. Or Marty.
5628080	5634160	What is your name, officer? Chief.
5637200	5645600	I've never hit a woman. Well, that wasn't the question. Jesus Christ. Are you the murderer?
5645600	5650960	Are we going to find out in episode seven that you're the murderer? You did it, right? No,
5650960	5657840	he did it. I'm the chief of police. He did it. I sent you to lunatics out there to sell a case
5657840	5662560	that anybody can solve. He clearly killed the ladies. No, the night the murder happened,
5662560	5669680	we were hanging out and then he had to go do laundry, you said. So he was doing a lot.
5669680	5673200	What kind of alibi is this? So special.
5674000	5679360	Goddamn it, Pakistani. Hey, if you weren't so good looking.
5689280	5690640	It's a Pakistani sauce.
5693440	5696880	All right. Well, it's a good show. I'm looking forward to everything.
5696880	5701040	I'm going to stick it. It's a golden age of television. The new thing about TV is it's not,
5701120	5706960	it doesn't, it's now, they're owning up to the fact that these are just mini series.
5707680	5710960	This thing's going to have an ending. Yeah, it's great. And if it's a bad ending,
5710960	5716800	then he'll own up to it. I'm Twitter buddies with the creator. I don't want to suffocate him.
5716800	5723840	We're friends. He's a big fan of my work. I don't want to suffocate him. You're a fan of his show?
5724960	5730240	No, I hate his show. What the fuck? I was going to say Mumblebrag.
5731040	5737360	Oh, because they mumble a lot in that shit. I asked him, I asked, I said,
5737360	5740800	because I noticed he was following me. So I started following him and then I direct message him.
5740800	5746240	Is this Nick Pizzolato? Yeah. And I said, uh, Hey, do you want, do you ever want to, uh,
5746240	5751120	hang out, have a drink and, or come on Harbin Town and talk about that? And he said,
5751120	5757120	and his response was I'd love to have a drink sometime. So he won't be coming on the show.
5757760	5763520	Have you met him in person? No. Okay. But you will best friends. It's a great show.
5763520	5767600	It really is. I was hooked from the beginning. It didn't take me two and a half episodes.
5767600	5771040	I was, I was into it. I was two and a half back to back. I would have made it to three,
5771040	5774640	but I felt sick because it was, you know, like 3am. So I finally just like dozed off.
5775200	5779760	Something strange about a man that refuses to enjoy a TV show.
5779760	5788240	A lot of bad ones out there. A lot of good ones.
5789600	5794000	So what's the difference between one you choose to accept?
5794000	5797360	Why is he talking like that? Is he, is that him doing an accent? Like he's trying to be
5797360	5800080	more Texan than what he also did. Did he get in a horrible accident?
5801120	5804800	Is it me or is his nose broken? He's not from nose is broken too. Like he has like a weird
5804800	5811040	scar across his nose and his nose. He's making his bid for iconography. I think he wants a,
5811040	5815520	somebody to start doing impressions of him. He's overacting it and all the, all the,
5815520	5819600	I really like him in it. I fucking, I think you're a son of a bitch, Jeff. You're a son of a bitch.
5820640	5826240	You've, you've become a curmudgeon. He's the gravity of actors. You're a curmudgeon.
5827040	5831040	You don't like gravity. I fucking hate. Oh, you were like gravity. He went off on it for
5831040	5834240	a million minutes. Gravity sucks. Gravity sucks. It was all from,
5834240	5839440	Watch it again. Make him, Dan, you're a writer. It's not, I'm a reader. I'm not an aerospace
5839440	5847280	engineer. No, dammit, Jim. The science flaws in it are totally like, who gives a fuck? What's
5847280	5851440	a lightsaber? I don't give a fuck. Tell me the rules. Make them up. Yeah. The sound in space.
5851440	5855840	If you say so, George Lucas, like it would tell a story. There's no fucking movie in that movie.
5855840	5860640	It's just a bunch of stupid. It could have been called, it could have been called a
5861120	5865840	driveway. But then they could have made a driveway movie. I don't understand why that makes sense.
5865840	5868640	They could have made a driveway movie. It would have been just as good or bad. No,
5868640	5874080	it wouldn't have been. It would have been worse. You're right. It would have been worse only
5874080	5877840	because the only thing good about that movie is that it happens in space. But that's a lot of
5877840	5882640	great thing to happen in a movie. Certainly. Then give the cinematographer an award. They did.
5882640	5889760	It's good. But don't give anybody else a word in that fucking movie because the movie fucking
5889760	5894480	stinks. It stinks. Nothing happens. Make a movie about lost in space. It's exciting material.
5894480	5898560	And Aaron keeps telling me I'm not a feminist just because I keep saying Sandra Bullock's
5898560	5903440	ass looks great at 50. Listen, they knew that her ass looked great. That's why.
5905680	5910320	Yeah. Her ass was. But not her whole ass. That's, that's, that's, that's like, I just,
5911040	5915120	no, they didn't completely generate her ass. You get the end of the movie.
5916560	5922240	You can hear it. You can airbrush cellulite and stuff or whatever. But, but, but she, I'm saying,
5922240	5926480	I don't know, I'm making a joke now as it irritates Aaron because I keep saying like,
5926480	5933120	I'm a feminist because I'm like, you go girl. It's funny to me. I don't know. I think the
5933120	5937760	definition of feminism has become very funny because it's about you consume media along with
5937760	5942160	everyone else. And then based on whether you think the frozen lady should have like worn one
5942160	5947600	outfit or another, you can call yourself a feminist. People on tumblr, right, right, right.
5947600	5952480	Things. And they go like, Oh, Britta's the betrayal of, but I just think it's funny that
5952480	5959600	we all consume media, like a bunch of fucking disgusting, uh, uh, larva, uh, like sucking on
5959600	5963760	these tubes that come from the ministry of propaganda. And the difference between a so
5963760	5970000	and so and such and such is people who go, let's taste like vanilla. I got a shamrock one.
5970720	5978800	I think it's silly. I don't think it's revolutionary to, uh, to post an emoji of an eye roll
5978800	5984800	after something that you didn't like on deadwood. I don't think that that counts as a progress as
5984800	5992640	contributing. Yeah, but gravity is not a good movie. Did you float away in space?
5994160	6000240	Wood that I had. I did like it. I did. I had a great time at the movies watching it. I thought
6000240	6004640	it was gorgeously shot and it was very sexy and good looking and technically wonderful. I just
6004640	6010240	think that they wasted an awesome opportunity to tell the story about what that might be like.
6011040	6015440	Thank you. Beefsteak bills on my side. All right. The, the elephant in the room is Spencer once
6015440	6020240	again, taking the week off. He's got Kumeil status now. He comes and goes as he pleases.
6020240	6024080	We have a chair over there. Like, like, like the, it seems like a, there's a rule of packing tape
6024080	6028960	on it. No blank diet. And there's that photo of the microphone. Was nobody there? I don't want to,
6028960	6033760	I don't want to, I mean, should, should ice tea, uh, take you guys through a little two person
6033760	6038880	adventure? Well, we have, we, it's, it's 9 49 right now. I can do it in nine minutes. All right.
6038880	6043040	Let's do a quick, uh, side thing. Unless you have a better idea. No, I think we should. Let's do a
6043040	6047520	little, if anyone wants some ice tea D and D real quick, before we get out here, I could do an Oscar
6047520	6055440	rap. I could do Oscar rap. Well, why not do both? Let's see. Let's see if an Oscar rap goes anywhere.
6055440	6060080	Okay. All right. Do you want to be here? Shouldn't you do that to close the show? Oscar? Let's see
6060080	6064240	if it closes the show. All right. Go for it. Look, look, if we close the show here, then we all,
6065120	6070640	the sooner we get to go back and rent, uh, gravity on DVD or Blu-ray. Let's see if the Oscar rap can
6070640	6080960	close the show. But if it doesn't, then we'll ice tea. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, Oscar rap. Yo, yo, yo,
6080960	6086560	chamomile. Get those hands together, everybody. The man who wrote Hugh Jackman's and the award
6086560	6095680	winning, uh, Oscar winning songs. Get your faces on fun. Sandra Pollock sits stranded in space.
