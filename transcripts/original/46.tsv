0	14680	You seem like an audience that doesn't give a shit about false starts.
14680	16960	Well, guess what?
16960	21360	You've come to a magical place where anything can happen and I always will.
21360	26360	Welcome to the stage for the second time, Dan Hermit.
26360	28360	It's magical!
28360	31360	You know it, you know it!
31360	33360	Never be me!
33360	36360	Black shower in the floor!
36360	39360	The devil!
39360	41360	Uh, yes.
41360	42360	We did it.
42360	48360	We did it from Goldberg, a little satanic Goldberg in the front.
48360	51360	Tonight's about being comfortable with chaos.
51360	55360	I was sitting in the back room and I was thinking like, I don't have anything.
55360	58360	I'm going to run out like a dish rack from the Oscars.
58360	61360	This will be broadcasting a little bit after it's relevant.
61360	66360	We don't have to talk about Seth MacFarlane all night because then it will air like later
66360	70360	and people will be like, oh, I'm fresh.
70360	75360	Real quick, because I watched 45 minutes of it and that was quite enough for me.
75360	77360	What is your take away from the Oscars?
77360	82360	I didn't look up and see what the zeitgeist or the gestalt or the...
82360	84360	The Hormenheit?
84360	86360	Yeah, the Hormenhammer.
86360	90360	Was about the whole thing, but I assume, I'm going to go ahead and guess if I was a betting man
90360	93360	that it would be mixed bag.
93360	97360	Which I think is what Ryan Ridley said this morning when he came into Rick and Morty.
97360	98360	Mixed bag?
98360	102360	Yeah, it seemed like, I mean in the world of Oscars, you really have to close your eyes
102360	104360	and ask yourself, what's the ultimate Oscars?
104360	110360	Aside from the one Hugh Jackman hosted that I wrote.
110360	111360	You wrote the whole Oscars?
111360	114360	Well, I wrote the opening thing.
114360	117360	You know what Schwab just told me a couple of days ago?
117360	122360	I never told you this because it was going down during the whole Chevy debacle
122360	125360	and I figured I didn't want to put another nickel in you or give you any reason
125360	128360	to get in any embarrassing public shenanigans.
128360	132360	But there was this article after the Billy Crystal Oscars
132360	136360	where some snarky blog printed an article that said,
136360	139360	here's the 10 things you have to do to save the Oscars.
139360	142360	Number one, get rid of Bruce Valanche
142360	147360	and bring the guys back that wrote that Hugh Jackman opening.
147360	149360	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
149360	151360	Not a hero, the person doing this.
151360	154360	I mean, who cares what his opinion is?
154360	157360	And what are good Oscars? Who cares?
157360	160360	But in the comment section under it, Schwab tells me,
160360	166360	Bruce Valanche signs in and says, according to Schwab,
166360	168360	this is kind of urban legend because I'm quoting Schwab,
168360	171360	who's giving me here, say, from this comment section.
171360	176360	Something akin to, I'm very sorry that you feel I'm past my prime.
176360	177360	I did my best.
177360	180360	You know, those guys, we all worked on that opening together
180360	183360	and they're the only ones that won the Emmy
183360	186360	because they were the ones that were credited for it.
186360	190360	But lie, lie, like lie.
190360	193360	180 degrees from the truth, lie.
193360	196360	Now, do people know who Bruce Valanche is in the audience?
196360	198360	Yeah, I think he's kind of famous.
198360	200360	Are you clapping because you know who he is
200360	203360	or clapping because you're fans of Bruce Valanche?
203360	206360	Clap if you're a big Bruce Valanche fan.
206360	211360	I mean, he's on Hollywood Squares or was at one point.
211360	213360	He was drawn in The Simpsons.
213360	217360	I mean, he's an iconic non-icon, you know?
217360	220360	Like for 15, 20 years, God knows what,
220360	222360	he's been writing on the Oscars.
222360	224360	I just thought that was a weird, that's a weird thing
224360	227360	because it's like in the world of writing and TV and stuff,
227360	231360	there's always room for all kinds of revisionist kind of like,
231360	234360	well, you know, Chris McKenna came up with that joke,
234360	236360	but really it was my idea kind of thing.
236360	238360	It's like you forget, you work in collaborative environments.
238360	240360	It's like, it's very easy to forget.
240360	243360	There's a lot of like, especially if you're actually really good
243360	245360	and collaborative, you totally forget what you wrote
245360	247360	and what someone else wrote.
247360	252360	But that is not, we walked into the first day of working with that guy
252360	255360	with a finished thing because it was songs and stuff
255360	258360	and there were sets built that Rob made out of cardboard.
258360	261360	So for him to say that in a comment section,
261360	262360	like I thought...
262360	265360	Dan, if you could say one word to Bruce Valanche.
265360	267360	Liar.
267360	269360	Like weird liar.
269360	272360	If I get two, I get two, weird liar.
272360	276360	Three, like weird, weird liar.
276360	278360	Weird, lying, weird liar.
278360	281360	I would build out from there until it was a bucky ball
281360	283360	of just calling him a fucking liar.
283360	285360	Like just weird.
285360	288360	Like with question marks all over it going like,
288360	290360	like why?
290360	292360	I want to know.
292360	298360	Like if you're a sociopath, then dress differently.
298360	302360	If you're just an automaton that's only like this Machiavellian,
302360	305360	the ends justifies the means, then why?
305360	308360	Well, where did you arrive at Bruce Valanche as a persona?
308360	310360	Like, well, how is that effective?
310360	313360	And I just like, honestly, man, that...
313360	315360	Was he cool to work with? Was he a good guy?
315360	317360	No, no.
317360	318360	No.
318360	321360	Like, and I'm not, you know, hey, look, I'm notoriously apparently
321360	323360	not cool to work with.
323360	326360	I have all kinds of stuff to argue with about that.
326360	329360	But I mean, I think that the people that say that I'm hard to work with
329360	331360	are themselves hard to work with.
331360	334360	I think that they're just bummed out
334360	336360	and they grab for the edge of the pool that's there,
336360	338360	which is like, oh, you know, there's a bunch of people over here
338360	342360	that also were made to feel stupid and untalented.
342360	344360	You know what? He's crazy.
344360	345360	Oh, it's crazy? He's crazy.
345360	347360	Hey, everybody, he's crazy.
347360	349360	You know, there's a bunch of really awesome people
349360	351360	in the middle of that pool hanging out
351360	357360	and crushing Bruce and broing down.
357360	360360	Is that how they talk in the middle of the pool?
360360	363360	Yeah, that's where you have the inflatable bunker,
363360	365360	you know, the squirt gun mounted in it.
365360	367360	It's like, we're having fun out there playing chicken and...
367360	369360	Crushing Bruce?
369360	370360	Yeah.
370360	372360	Anyway, it's just weird, just weird.
372360	376360	I don't know. Bruce Vellanche, somehow, if you receive this message somehow.
376360	379360	And he will, apparently, because he reads comment sections on...
379360	381360	Yeah, yeah.
381360	383360	I mean, I think he's a...
383360	386360	I put the word image-conscious in giant quotes.
386360	388360	Everybody hashtag Bruce Vellanche.
388360	390360	Like, let's try to...
390360	394360	I'm inviting you down, Bruce, to explain yourself.
394360	396360	Defend yourself, sir.
396360	401360	Granted, I will say this in his defense right now, preemptively,
401360	404360	that I did not read the source material that Rob was referring to.
404360	406360	But, I mean...
406360	409360	And I don't really want to go digging back for conflict, but...
409360	410360	Let's do it.
410360	412360	Bruce, come down.
412360	416360	Bruce, come down and let's talk about your lying-liarness.
416360	418360	Speaking of which, do we ever get...
418360	423360	There was a chance that Chevy was going to show up on the tour at some point.
423360	424360	He never did.
424360	425360	Yeah, I guess.
425360	427360	There's always a chance Chevy will show up,
427360	429360	but that was the same as on Community.
429360	430360	Like...
434360	436360	That was the whole point.
436360	441360	It was always a flip of a coin, whether he emerged from the trailer,
441360	444360	or what his hair would look like,
445360	447360	or what would be on his face,
447360	450360	and sometimes he'd be happy, and sometimes he'd be sad,
450360	451360	and sometimes he'd be angry.
451360	452360	Can we call it by then?
452360	453360	Yeah.
453360	456360	Every time we do that stuff, and it's like...
456360	460360	Vulture, HuffPo, TMZ, they extract without context,
460360	462360	and it's like... I don't know.
462360	464360	I saw world-weary. I have no reason to be world-weary.
464360	466360	The world gave me a blowjob.
466360	468360	Was there any fallout...
468360	473360	I mean, not fallout, or any reaction to when Jason Zudakis
473360	474360	called him as Joe Biden.
474360	475360	He called back.
475360	477360	He left a message saying,
477360	479360	What was that? Was that Danny Pooty?
479360	480360	What was that?
480360	482360	And then I explained to him.
482360	483360	I said,
483360	485360	No, that was Jason Zudakis from SNL,
485360	488360	and SNL, Saturday Night Live.
488360	490360	No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
490360	492360	But I wouldn't be surprised.
492360	493360	That would be to his credit.
493360	496360	I mean, SNL, they adopted that sometime during my life.
496360	497360	Like, he would remember it.
497360	498360	Like KFC.
498360	499360	Yeah.
500360	502360	But he...
502360	505360	And then he pitched me a TV show idea.
505360	507360	But we talked about this.
508360	509360	I'm world-weary, man.
509360	511360	Why are you so weary?
511360	512360	Well, it's Sunday.
512360	515360	It's after the Oscars, as we record this.
515360	517360	You just hung over?
517360	518360	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
518360	520360	We tied one on that night.
520360	523360	We played catchphrase till like 5 in the morning.
524360	525360	How'd that go?
525360	527360	I think I won.
528360	529360	Aaron just kept saying like,
529360	530360	Oh, we're playing to 20.
530360	531360	We're playing to 30.
531360	532360	We're playing to 40.
532360	533360	Like, she just likes to play.
533360	536360	And she just likes to play until I get mad.
537360	539360	She's playing a larger game.
542360	544360	Catch fight.
545360	547360	She's catching fights in a little jar.
547360	549360	No, it's a fun game.
549360	551360	But, you know, it's 5 in the morning.
551360	553360	And, you know,
553360	555360	it's like that game in Indiana Jones
556360	558360	that the what's-her-name is playing with the shot glasses,
558360	559360	you know?
559360	560360	Catchphrase.
560360	561360	Yeah, yeah.
561360	562360	Catchphrase is like that.
562360	564360	Because it's like four people around a table
564360	566360	and there's always the first person that's like,
566360	567360	that just stops.
567360	570360	Their brain stops being able to participate in catchphrase.
570360	573360	Like, they can't figure out what the things are.
573360	574360	They just go,
574360	576360	Okay, umpire.
576360	578360	The word is umpire.
578360	579360	The other person says,
579360	580360	You lose.
580360	581360	It's dumb.
581360	582360	Catchphrase stories.
582360	583360	Tonight at 11.
583360	584360	You won't believe it.
584360	585360	Dan tells all.
588360	590360	Bruce Elijah's right.
594360	595360	Anyways.
595360	597360	Is Ryan Ridley here in the audience?
597360	598360	Yeah.
598360	599360	All right.
599360	600360	Hey, come up here.
600360	601360	Our next guest is Ryan Ridley.
601360	602360	Oh, shit.
602360	603360	Ryan Ridley.
603360	623360	Ryan is a long time collaborator of mine and he works over at the Rick and Morty offices
623360	624360	right now, our Adult Swim show.
624360	626360	We're about halfway through the run here, script-wise.
626360	627360	Yeah.
627360	630360	And I told you if you came to the show, you could come up on stage.
630360	633360	It's the only way I can get people to come.
633360	636360	So, justify it.
636360	639360	You got a tarantula or something?
639360	641360	I was thinking about what my angle would be.
641360	642360	I don't really know.
642360	646360	I guess because you said that there's not enough neurosis on stage.
646360	647360	I was being sarcastic.
647360	649360	So, I decided I'm going to not be neurotic.
649360	650360	Oh, okay.
650360	651360	Be suave.
651360	652360	Good luck.
652360	654360	You kind of look like Freddie Prinze Jr.
654360	655360	Thank you.
656360	657360	Some people say.
657360	658360	Uh-huh.
659360	663360	I'm bad with faces, but you don't have any warts or anything, so that makes you handsome
663360	664360	compared to this.
664360	665360	I have brown hair and brown eyes.
665360	666360	Yeah.
666360	667360	Yeah.
667360	668360	Beautiful, dreamy, endless brown eyes.
668360	669360	Yeah.
669360	670360	I noticed you're staring into them a lot at work.
670360	671360	Yeah.
671360	673360	I got, Dan, what were you going to say about the story?
673360	677360	I was kissing you by a crystal blue Italian stream.
680360	682360	How's it going working for me?
682360	684360	How hard am I to work with?
689360	693360	You know, we had a little dust up, but other than that, it's pretty good.
693360	694360	You had a dust up?
694360	695360	Yeah.
695360	701360	Well, I went on tour and I came back and I was saying a couple of outlines needed more
701360	702360	work.
702360	707360	And then Ryan, who had kind of like, Ryan started the Chris McKenna over at Rick and
707360	708360	Morty.
708360	709360	What's that mean?
709360	713360	Well, Chris McKenna was like my right hand, the heart of the show, I would say.
713360	715360	I wasn't saying that out of neurosis.
715360	716360	Okay.
716360	717360	Yeah.
719360	725360	And so, you know, he's like Chris was the guy that was responsible in the absence of
725360	726360	responsibility.
726360	730360	You know, Justin Roiland, who co-created the show with me, he's as crazy as I am in
730360	731360	different ways.
731360	732360	Yeah.
732360	733360	And you're the point man.
733360	735360	You got to batten down the hatches.
735360	736360	I'm the wonder bread.
736360	737360	Yeah.
737360	738360	You guys are the peanut butter and jelly.
738360	739360	You got to churn out that stuff.
739360	740360	Great job.
740360	744360	So you put a lot of work into an outline while I was on the road and I came back and
744360	749360	I was like, the outline, you know, I think I think I think we need to take a step back
749360	750360	on this one.
750360	753360	And you went, well, I wish you would have said that a month ago.
753360	757360	And you and you and then you started punching a black baby.
757360	758360	Yeah.
758360	759360	Is that true, Ryan?
759360	760360	Yeah.
760360	761360	Is that true?
761360	762360	I wasn't punching it.
762360	763360	Yeah.
763360	765360	Just throttling it.
765360	767360	Not a monster.
767360	771360	But yeah, he's spinning it a little in his direction.
771360	772360	Yeah.
772360	773360	Should I elaborate?
773360	775360	I don't know.
775360	776360	If you want to.
776360	778360	I mean, you're the one who brought up the dust up.
778360	779360	Yeah.
779360	780360	I don't know.
780360	781360	I thought that would be something, you know, I don't know.
781360	782360	That's a good angle, right?
782360	783360	Yeah, I guess.
783360	784360	All right.
784360	785360	Dan.
785360	786360	Hey, there's Abed.
786360	787360	Oh, no.
787360	788360	Oh, real Abed's here.
788360	789360	Yeah.
789360	790360	Yeah.
790360	791360	Real Abed's here.
791360	792360	We'll get with him in a minute, I think.
792360	793360	And he'd come up here too.
793360	794360	Yeah.
794360	795360	Yeah.
795360	798360	Dan, do you respect Ryan as an employee, as a co-worker?
798360	799360	Not that I care.
799360	800360	Yeah.
800360	802360	I'm confident enough in myself.
802360	806360	I did Water and Power, Channel 101's best series in the history of Channel 101.
806360	807360	Right.
807360	808360	With Ryan.
808360	809360	Yeah.
809360	813360	You know, we wrote many things together in front of an open laptop.
813360	818360	Like, I don't let a lot of people come around when I'm actually typing something on a screen.
818360	819360	That's a big thing for me.
819360	820360	Yeah.
820360	821360	It's like pooping.
821360	822360	I felt good.
822360	823360	I felt good to hear that.
823360	824360	Yeah.
824360	825360	Yeah.
825360	829360	I mean, you're very insecure, very conscious of how other people perceive you.
829360	831360	Who here isn't, right?
831360	842360	I think maybe I am the Adam Goldberg, if maybe just a couple of things different in my life
842360	843360	happened.
843360	845360	And, you know, because I was a big fan of Dan's.
845360	847360	Like, I want to meet Dan and work with Dan.
847360	849360	And, you know, I don't know.
849360	850360	Makes sense to me.
850360	851360	Yeah.
851360	855360	Ryan Ridley is a legacy comedy personality.
855360	861360	His dad, Mark Ridley, founded and runs the Chicago Comedy Castle.
861360	862360	Detroit.
862360	863360	Detroit.
863360	864360	Yeah.
864360	865360	Yeah.
865360	866360	Yeah.
866360	869360	Mark Ridley's Comedy Castle.
869360	873360	So when you were growing up, you would, you know, Tim Allen would be like, you know.
873360	874360	Oh, yeah.
874360	875360	You saw a tiger game with him?
875360	881360	Crashed on the couch after a, you know, weekend-long coke bender.
881360	887360	We had a lot of tools at the house.
887360	888360	Yeah.
888360	889360	Yeah.
889360	895360	Like little straws and razor blades and those kind of tools.
895360	897360	That's what tool time was back then.
897360	900360	There was always a guy peering over something.
900360	902360	You know, he saw from your house.
902360	906360	There's this dealer, like, hey, what's going on?
906360	910360	That's the inside joke of that gag is that you never see his nose.
910360	911360	It's his deviated septum.
911360	914360	It's sort of a life of cocaine.
914360	921360	It's based on a guy from Detroit named Sniffer.
921360	922360	Uncle Sniffer.
922360	924360	Uncle Sniffer is a coke dealer.
924360	925360	Yeah.
925360	928360	No one's uncle, really.
928360	935360	So, Ryan, your podcast with Justin.
935360	936360	Thank you.
936360	937360	Thank you.
937360	938360	Why are they laughing?
939360	945360	I would actually recommend people listen to Ryan's podcast with Justin Roiland, the Rick and Morty creator.
945360	947360	Was that a laugh of recognition because of the podcast?
947360	948360	Oh, no.
948360	949360	God damn it.
950360	952360	Somebody clapped in the back or something.
952360	954360	Oh, anybody?
954360	955360	Do I know you?
955360	956360	Are we friends?
956360	957360	Oh, all right.
957360	958360	All right.
959360	963360	It's very addictive and very funny little personalities you guys have.
963360	964360	Yeah.
964360	966360	Well, you said you're inspired by it and that's why you did this podcast.
966360	967360	Yeah, I probably stole the idea.
967360	968360	Yeah.
968360	970360	But, yeah, yeah.
970360	976360	From you and seeing Proops at Sketchfest that first year we went, I think I was like, okay, let's just start podcasting.
976360	977360	Whatever.
977360	979360	He had to throw Proops into it.
979360	980360	He couldn't just gone with us.
982360	983360	You said no neurosis.
983360	985360	I know, Jeff.
985360	986360	It's hard.
988360	989360	All right.
989360	991360	So, should we bring Real Abbot up?
991360	992360	Yeah.
992360	993360	Real Abbot.
993360	994360	He's never been brought up before?
994360	995360	I don't think he's ever been up.
995360	996360	No.
996360	997360	Yeah.
1001360	1002360	Real Abbot.
1002360	1003360	Is this like it's nice that I moved down?
1003360	1004360	Is this an Abbot game?
1004360	1005360	No, Abbot.
1006360	1010360	The man who the character Abbot on the community was based upon.
1010360	1011360	You were sitting here, right?
1011360	1014360	Wait, you stand here for me.
1017360	1018360	Hello, everybody.
1018360	1019360	Hey.
1019360	1020360	Thanks for being here.
1020360	1022360	I didn't expect to come on stage, but that's fine.
1022360	1023360	It's all right.
1023360	1025360	You shouldn't have sat in the exact center of the audience.
1025360	1026360	That was counting.
1026360	1027360	My eyes.
1027360	1028360	I mean, you almost sat like the...
1028360	1029360	I can't see that way.
1029360	1030360	I was like so worried.
1030360	1032360	I was like trying to avoid your gaze.
1032360	1035360	And I knew in a minute, the minute you looked at me, you would say something.
1035360	1036360	Yeah.
1036360	1037360	All right.
1037360	1038360	I feel like I should sit down.
1038360	1039360	No, no, no, no.
1039360	1040360	Stand.
1040360	1041360	Is that a table?
1041360	1042360	No.
1042360	1043360	It's not sturdy.
1043360	1044360	No, you can't.
1044360	1045360	Stop that.
1045360	1046360	Sorry, sorry.
1046360	1047360	I feel like I'm doing stand-up.
1047360	1048360	Yeah.
1048360	1049360	Well, no.
1049360	1050360	It's like this is the Freudian thing.
1050360	1051360	Like he developed this...
1051360	1054360	Like when you face away, that's the development of that couch.
1054360	1056360	Look at the audience and listen to us.
1056360	1057360	Oh, okay.
1057360	1058360	We're going to counsel you.
1058360	1059360	Straight ahead, yeah.
1059360	1060360	So Abed...
1060360	1061360	Abed's name is Abed.
1061360	1065760	That's where I got the idea for the name Abed.
1065760	1067000	He's also a bit of a...
1067000	1074080	I would call you a pop-cultural savant kind of, but really it's more music for you.
1074080	1075080	I think when you...
1075080	1076920	No, actually more like television.
1076920	1077920	Really?
1077920	1081440	I think more in television and film than music.
1081440	1084160	Music was like something I dabbled in, just like I was bored.
1084160	1085560	And he knows a ton about it.
1085560	1086560	So that's just dabbling.
1086560	1091480	I learned everything and I moved on, kind of, it's like I've heard enough music.
1091480	1093920	You can only take so much music, you know.
1093920	1098120	All right, Abed, Abed, who wrote or who sings this song?
1098120	1099120	Uh-oh.
1099120	1104360	I'm bad at this.
1104360	1105840	Don't help him.
1105840	1108680	Don't help him.
1108680	1112800	I want to say this is...
1112800	1114720	It feels like Led Zeppelin.
1114720	1115720	Nope.
1115720	1116720	Deep Purple.
1116720	1117720	Deep Purple, yeah.
1117720	1118720	Adam Goldberg got it.
1118720	1119720	Adam Goldberg got it.
1119720	1122720	I see I was close because of Almost Famous.
1122720	1123720	Aren't they both in that movie?
1123720	1124720	I don't know.
1124720	1125720	Yeah.
1125720	1127320	Close enough, I think.
1127320	1128320	All right.
1128320	1130520	So by now you're saying real Abed?
1130520	1133680	Well, that wasn't fair.
1133680	1135400	That was like so wildcard.
1135400	1136560	Well, do you want to...
1136560	1137560	That's my next question.
1137560	1138560	Do you want...
1139560	1147680	To what extent do you want to think that the character community is congruous with you?
1147680	1151520	What would make you more outraged or uncomfortable?
1151520	1154960	The idea that he's nothing like you or the idea that he's exactly like you and therefore
1154960	1158000	I have somehow exploited you?
1158000	1159640	You know, everyone gets exploited though.
1159640	1160640	That's the thing.
1160640	1161640	I mean, that's nothing new.
1161640	1162640	It's the American dream.
1162640	1163640	Yeah.
1163640	1164640	I mean, it's been happening since...
1164640	1166280	And my people were exploited, basically.
1166280	1167280	By mine.
1167280	1168280	Yeah, by his.
1169000	1170640	I didn't think we could get along so well.
1170640	1172640	Ryan's half Jewish and Abed's half Palestinian.
1172640	1175720	That's just how it goes with friends.
1175720	1179520	But no, like, I honestly...
1179520	1184160	So half of you exploited half of him, but half of both of you just sit and eat Twinkies
1184160	1185160	and don't care.
1185160	1186160	I like...
1186160	1187800	Half of them is fine.
1187800	1190760	The other half I got a problem with.
1190760	1191760	Not really.
1191760	1192760	But you know...
1192760	1198180	Yeah, like, I wrote the part and I really wrote the part with the idea in my head that
1198180	1202460	you would come in and audition for the part, which you did.
1202460	1204860	Which that was an amazing time of my life, by the way.
1204860	1205860	Yeah, yeah.
1205860	1208620	I grew from like, you know, a boy to a close.
1208620	1210020	Do you remember who else auditioned?
1210020	1211620	Like who made it to the final round?
1211620	1212620	It was Kumail.
1212620	1213620	Kumail Nanjiani.
1213620	1215580	We were both in the same room and then also...
1215580	1218460	Which I knew him, which was crazy because I was like, I hope you get it, buddy.
1218460	1219820	And the guy from 30 Rock?
1219820	1220820	Yeah.
1220820	1221820	And then Danny Pooty was there too.
1221820	1224660	But I don't at the time didn't know he was Danny Pooty.
1224660	1225660	Yeah.
1225660	1226660	Well, he wasn't Danny Pooty at that time.
1226660	1228660	He shook his hand and he was Danny.
1228660	1230660	No, I actually...
1230660	1234180	Here's the guy from movietickets.com ad up until that point.
1234180	1235180	Yeah.
1235180	1237860	No, I remember something now when I was leaving.
1237860	1242620	I remember leaving and I think it was when I was kind of doing good and I saw him coming
1242620	1243620	out.
1243620	1245620	It was Danny Pooty because I remembered his face.
1245620	1249940	And also you said he looked like a peanut at one point.
1249940	1251860	Sorry, but you did.
1251860	1254100	And then so I was coming out and...
1254100	1255300	I won't take it back.
1255300	1256940	I saw him on the phone.
1256940	1258020	I don't know where this is going.
1258020	1261900	I saw him on the phone and he looked like so happy.
1261900	1267980	Like he was ecstatic and he was just like, I wasn't that happy.
1267980	1270500	And so I felt like, yeah, I mean, I guess he's going to get it.
1270500	1272020	I mean, everybody kind of nailed it.
1272020	1275300	After you walked out, everyone was like, holy shit, that guy is like, like, like, I can
1275300	1280100	see now where you got the idea for like the personality, like some of this stuff on paper
1280100	1281100	now makes sense.
1281100	1282980	But they said the same thing after Camille.
1282980	1284340	They said the same thing after...
1284340	1287540	I can't really remember his name, the guy that plays the assistant in 30 Rock.
1287540	1289620	Like Johnny Arbin or something.
1289620	1290620	Johnny Arbin.
1290620	1291620	That's got to be it.
1291620	1296580	I feel bad now because that guy's going to get mad, right?
1296580	1297580	I'm sure.
1297580	1298580	Yeah.
1298580	1300820	He was a long time listener and tonight's the night finally we talked about him and
1300820	1301820	we couldn't get his name.
1301820	1302820	Oh, no.
1302820	1304580	He's going to beat me up after the show.
1304580	1307780	But yeah, I mean, but Pooty was just the different...
1307780	1311060	All he came in and it was just like, okay, after he walked out, it was like, okay, so
1311060	1314220	are we going to have a show with that guy in it or not?
1314220	1318380	And so it had nothing to do with being right for the character as it was like, like, now
1318380	1321580	let's make the character right for that guy because he's like a superstar.
1321580	1322580	Well, that's how I feel.
1322580	1323980	I mean, he did these amazing things when he came in.
1323980	1325420	No, but see, I see that.
1325420	1329580	I see that I inspired the character, but then you took it into a really cool direction and
1329580	1331060	it became its own thing.
1331060	1332980	And so Danny brought a lot of himself to it.
1332980	1333980	Yeah.
1333980	1334980	And that's how it happened.
1334980	1335980	Guess what, Abed?
1335980	1336980	They can't fire your creator.
1336980	1340820	You're going to be the same Abed the rest of your life.
1340820	1341820	That's right.
1341820	1342820	I'm in it for life, actually.
1342820	1343820	Yeah.
1344420	1349820	In a sense, half of your people are like changing it to a different time slot.
1349820	1350820	We have some notes.
1350820	1351820	Yeah.
1351820	1352820	Yeah.
1352820	1353820	Yeah.
1353820	1355820	You've tried to fire his creator.
1355820	1356820	Clearly.
1356820	1357820	Yeah.
1357820	1358820	Come on.
1358820	1359820	All right.
1359820	1360820	I don't want to go there.
1360820	1362820	That's a whole other can.
1362820	1364820	That's a whole other show.
1364820	1366820	Do you think Palestine should be a state, Abed?
1366820	1369820	Well, it is Dan, actually.
1369820	1371820	I mean, he calls it Israel.
1371820	1372820	I call it Palestine.
1372820	1375820	It's like apples and potatoes and patatas kind of thing.
1375820	1376820	Right.
1376820	1377820	Latkes and clumps of dirt.
1377820	1378820	Latkes and patatkes?
1378820	1379820	Yeah.
1379820	1381820	I don't even know what they have.
1381820	1382820	Patatkes?
1382820	1383820	I don't know what the...
1383820	1384820	Do you say latkes?
1384820	1385820	I say patatkes?
1385820	1389820	They have some food that's like blah, blah, blah.
1389820	1390820	Whatever.
1390820	1391820	I can't say it.
1391820	1392820	I don't remember.
1392820	1393820	I ate it.
1393820	1394820	It was good.
1394820	1395820	I don't remember what it was called.
1395820	1396820	It's not called patatkes.
1396820	1397820	Yeah, patatkes.
1397820	1401820	If Dan had said that, he hates and blah, blah, blah.
1401820	1406820	Abed, before you go, will you tell everybody your idea for a restaurant?
1406820	1407820	Oh, no.
1407820	1408820	This again.
1408820	1409820	How many times have we...
1409820	1410820	Okay.
1410820	1411820	Well, this is like...
1411820	1414820	I came up with this so long ago, and it was like...
1414820	1415820	I don't know why...
1415820	1416820	But it was a real idea for a restaurant.
1416820	1417820	Yeah, it was a real idea.
1417820	1421820	And for some reason, you attach to it so tenaciously, like over the years.
1421820	1422820	Because it's insane.
1422820	1424820	It's not insane, though.
1424820	1425820	It's totally...
1425820	1426820	It should happen, basically.
1426820	1427820	Well, I'm sure they'll agree.
1427820	1428820	Just tell them.
1428820	1429820	Tell them.
1429820	1430820	Okay.
1430820	1433820	Don't forget the specifics, like when I tell you the story every time.
1433820	1434820	Right.
1434820	1436820	So, like, you have...
1436820	1439820	Now, we all realize that little foods are taking over, right?
1439820	1440820	Foods are getting smaller.
1440820	1441820	I mean, that's...
1441820	1442820	Yeah.
1442820	1443820	And, like, health...
1443820	1444820	We all agree on this, right?
1444820	1445820	Yes, I mean...
1445820	1446820	We all agree.
1446820	1447820	It's as simple as...
1447820	1448820	As a premise.
1448820	1449820	Just...
1449820	1454820	Let's all agree as a premise before he goes any further, that little foods are taking over.
1454820	1457820	Just as the Wright brothers had to accept gravity.
1457820	1458820	Yeah, yeah.
1458820	1460820	I mean, I didn't write the rules.
1460820	1461820	There's just fundamentals.
1461820	1462820	Wake up, you guys.
1462820	1463820	Okay, fact number one.
1463820	1464820	Shake off the idea of art.
1464820	1466820	Little foods are taking over.
1466820	1468820	For one time in your life.
1468820	1469820	I mean, okay.
1469820	1470820	You're in a restaurant.
1470820	1473820	You see a plate of little burgers and a plate of a normal burger.
1473820	1475820	I think you'll go to the little burgers.
1475820	1477820	Fact number two.
1477820	1479820	You could have, like...
1479820	1481820	You could have, like, one little burger and be like,
1481820	1482820	Oh, man, I gotta taste it.
1482820	1483820	I don't feel guilty.
1483820	1484820	It's great.
1484820	1487820	The whole hamburger, if you eat, like, some of it and you just put it down, you're like,
1487820	1488820	That guy's wasting food.
1488820	1489820	Fuck him.
1489820	1492820	You can't save it for later because it's weird.
1492820	1493820	I don't know.
1493820	1494820	So anyway...
1494820	1495820	I'm with you, baby.
1495820	1498820	Where can you go to get food that's all small?
1498820	1499820	You know?
1499820	1500820	There's no place.
1500820	1503820	You could go to the Smurfs Village.
1503820	1505820	That doesn't exist, though.
1505820	1506820	A tapas restaurant?
1506820	1507820	I think we've looked for that.
1507820	1508820	What?
1508820	1509820	Tapas.
1509820	1510820	A tapas restaurant?
1510820	1512820	The Spanish have been doing this for centuries.
1512820	1515820	Oh, so they make small, like, burritos and tacos and stuff?
1515820	1516820	They make little...
1517820	1518820	No, no, no.
1518820	1519820	I mean, like...
1519820	1520820	No, no.
1520820	1521820	That's Mexico.
1521820	1525820	The Spanish don't make burritos.
1525820	1526820	Describe your restaurant, Abba.
1526820	1527820	Describe your restaurant.
1527820	1529820	So the restaurant's called Bytes.
1529820	1530820	Bytes?
1530820	1533820	And at the time, I thought it was clever to spell it with a Y.
1533820	1534820	Right.
1534820	1536820	Because then everyone would think it was a computer store.
1536820	1540820	Yeah, the computer age was starting to, like, jump into the... when I came up with the idea.
1540820	1542820	And then I was like, this idea...
1542820	1543820	Okay, okay.
1543820	1544820	You just go in...
1544820	1546820	Okay, let's say I'm with someone, like, a girlfriend.
1546820	1550820	If I had a girlfriend and she's like, oh, my God, I don't want pizza again, you asshole.
1550820	1551820	I want burgers.
1551820	1553820	And you're like, fuck you, I want burgers.
1553820	1555820	You know, that happens all the time.
1555820	1558820	At Bytes, she can have her, you know...
1558820	1560820	What kind of relationship is this?
1560820	1561820	No, I just...
1561820	1562820	I just generalize.
1562820	1564820	It sounds like a terrible relationship.
1564820	1565820	I'm saying...
1565820	1569820	You're, like, thinking fuck you, but you're saying, like, oh, I would like something else.
1569820	1570820	Okay.
1570820	1571820	All right.
1571820	1573820	That's like that Louis Armstrong song, right?
1573820	1575820	Talk to her nicely.
1575820	1576820	Treat her like a lady.
1576820	1578820	Okay, well, fuck you, lady.
1578820	1579820	Okay.
1579820	1580820	Fuck you, lady.
1580820	1583820	But, no, I mean, you know, okay.
1583820	1584820	So, that's the thing is, like...
1584820	1585820	So, you walk into Bytes.
1585820	1586820	Yeah.
1586820	1589820	And the maitre d' is that he sits you?
1589820	1591820	Well, he's small, too, actually.
1591820	1595820	The whole thing is gonna be, like, yeah, I have it all.
1595820	1596820	Wait.
1596820	1597820	I mean, okay, okay.
1597820	1598820	You guys are all laughing, but...
1598820	1601820	He's just talking about a tiny little village.
1601820	1606820	You guys are laughing, but if he's a little person and you order...
1606820	1610820	It intensifies the experience, because you're like, everything's small, it's so cool.
1610820	1611820	No, no, no.
1611820	1612820	The waiter should be giant.
1612820	1613820	They should be giant.
1613820	1617820	They should cast high relief on how small the bite of your food is.
1617820	1619820	Well, I don't know what the restaurant here has in there.
1619820	1621820	If your waiter's tiny, he gives you a tiny piece of pizza.
1621820	1623820	It looks like a real pizza.
1623820	1627820	But that's what's cool, because in his world, it's like, oh, normal pizza, but then he gives
1627820	1630820	it to you and you're like, whoa, small pizza from small guy.
1630820	1632820	Is he like a character when you come in?
1632820	1637820	He says, hey, can I get you some normal-sized food?
1637820	1644820	And there's a sign that says, don't tell him.
1644820	1645820	You should be a co-partner.
1645820	1647820	I mean...
1647820	1650820	I'm invested in worse, I believe it.
1650820	1651820	I couldn't have thought of that.
1651820	1654820	Abed, what is on the menu at Bites?
1654820	1656820	Take me through the...
1656820	1658820	What are the appetizers?
1658820	1660820	Well, the whole thing is appetizers, right?
1660820	1663820	Yeah, it's every kind of food there.
1663820	1666820	So you come in and you're like, man, I just love kabobs.
1666820	1667820	Oh, they're so good.
1667820	1670820	And McDonald's is like, kabob what?
1670820	1671820	What the fuck? Get out.
1671820	1675820	But you go to Bites, and you just go to the section of the map where the Middle East is,
1675820	1677820	and you got your kabobs right there, baby.
1677820	1680820	So what does a kabob at Bites look like?
1681820	1683820	Like a toothpick with a cherry tomato on it?
1683820	1687820	It's like a tiny, like, gyro or kabob or whatever.
1687820	1688820	It's just miniaturized.
1688820	1690820	Yeah, it's supposed to be a little poop or something.
1690820	1691820	Is that a kabob?
1691820	1692820	A little poop?
1692820	1693820	Kabobs look like poop.
1693820	1694820	Am I the only one that knows that?
1694820	1695820	Kabobs do not look like poop.
1695820	1696820	Yes, they do.
1696820	1697820	They look like a giant turd.
1697820	1698820	By applause, ladies.
1698820	1699820	Not if you're doing it right.
1699820	1701820	I see a kabob and I go, giant turd.
1701820	1702820	It's not a food.
1702820	1703820	Okay.
1703820	1704820	And you want to say little turd.
1704820	1705820	Let's say...
1705820	1706820	Well, yeah, little turd in here.
1706820	1707820	That's the name of the special.
1707820	1709820	I walk into Bites with my girlfriend, whom I love.
1709820	1710820	Okay.
1710820	1712820	And I walk in there and I say, you know, honey,
1712820	1713820	what are you in the mood for?
1713820	1715820	She goes, I'm in the mood for soup.
1715820	1716820	Wow.
1716820	1721820	I would like a Vietnamese pho.
1721820	1724820	That's so fascinating because he had the same thing back in the day,
1724820	1727820	but his question was like, what about if I want soda?
1727820	1728820	Do I get a little drop of soda?
1728820	1729820	Right.
1729820	1730820	What do I get?
1730820	1731820	You know, like, what's the deal with that?
1731820	1734820	And then I had to say, which I think I was like mentally like,
1734820	1735820	fuck, what do I say?
1735820	1736820	He's got me.
1736820	1737820	I was like, all right.
1737820	1738820	Normal sized soda.
1738820	1739820	Because let's face it.
1739820	1742820	No one's going to be like excited about a drop of soda.
1742820	1747820	So I think with the soup, I'm not excited about midget waiters.
1747820	1748820	Well.
1748820	1751820	Yeah, that's going to freak me out too.
1751820	1752820	What?
1752820	1753820	Okay.
1753820	1754820	Well, then you guys are...
1754820	1755820	There was a guy at the...
1755820	1756820	There was a guy at the...
1756820	1760820	I mean, we're just trying to talk you through your business model here.
1760820	1761820	Can I tell you real quick?
1761820	1762820	Clearly I'm not a businessman.
1762820	1763820	I just want to interject.
1763820	1767820	When I was like 10 years old for a time, my parents separated and I lived with my mom
1767820	1769820	in South Milwaukee, as we called it.
1769820	1770820	South Milwaukee.
1770820	1775820	And there was a McDonald's there that my grandma always recommended because it had Billy the
1775820	1776820	Brownie.
1776820	1777820	And I always...
1777820	1782820	I grew up thinking Billy the Brownie was a legitimate McDonaldland character.
1782820	1787820	Little did I know I was going to a South Milwaukee McDonald's where some like homeless little
1787820	1792820	person dressed up like an elf and just hung out at McDonald's.
1792820	1794820	And would just talk to children and old people.
1794820	1795820	That was his name, Billy Brownie?
1795820	1796820	Yeah, Billy the Brownie.
1796820	1797820	Like a walk-on character?
1797820	1798820	Yeah.
1798820	1799820	And this was the...
1799820	1800820	Wait, it's like from Willow.
1800820	1801820	Remember the Brownie?
1801820	1802820	Hell yeah.
1802820	1807820	This was the early 80s and I had seen that Donald Sutherland movie, Don't Look Now.
1807820	1808820	Oh.
1808820	1809820	Yeah.
1809820	1812820	And a deafening silence from our 25-year-old peanut gallery.
1812820	1816820	Let me tell you, that'll put the midget fury in you in that movie.
1816820	1818820	Well, look, I mean, I can't control your...
1818820	1820820	You know, whatever your psychosis is.
1820820	1821820	I mean...
1821820	1822820	Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not...
1822820	1823820	No, I'm just...
1823820	1827940	Well, I'm just saying, like, that's the one experience I have with being in a restaurant
1827940	1828940	and having a little person be...
1828940	1829940	Okay.
1829940	1832100	I thought you were attacking the restaurant with that psychosis story.
1832100	1833100	I get...
1833100	1837620	Well, I think Jeff and I were both suggesting to you that with all due respect to all humanity,
1837620	1841660	like the idea of institutionalized, like, genetic...
1841660	1843100	It's a eugenic kind of thing you're doing.
1843100	1844100	Like you're going like...
1844100	1846940	It's like a dachshund that you've bred to work at your restaurant.
1846940	1849820	You're opening a lot of doors for me here because now I'm thinking of an Oompa Loompa
1849820	1850820	situation.
1851820	1854820	You can find a special kind of little person who exists.
1854820	1855820	It's like Hooters for little people.
1855820	1859820	Who really exists in one land and their skin is like blue and they're like...
1859820	1860820	Or not blue stars.
1860820	1861820	What about the animals?
1861820	1862820	Are you going to breed little animals?
1862820	1867820	I just feel like Community would have had a better show with this Abed.
1867820	1868820	I do, yeah.
1868820	1869820	We've been a way different show, yeah.
1869820	1871820	I would have drove them nuts.
1871820	1878260	Okay, so now I don't want to bend your mind, but take me into the kitchen at Bites because
1878260	1884820	this is where my investment is hesitant because I feel like the overhead is maximized in
1884820	1891300	a kitchen where, okay, so three tiny pizzas, one half anchovies, one half mushroom, and
1891300	1896700	two tiny tacos, and one tiny chicken shish kebab.
1896700	1897700	They have to...
1897700	1899460	I think the way to do it is you make a real pizza in the kitchen.
1899460	1900460	Here's my pitch.
1900460	1905020	You make a real pizza in the kitchen and then you have a little like a cookie cutter that's
1905020	1909580	shaped like teeth, like a little Bites, and so it looks like somebody already bit out
1909580	1910580	of the pizza.
1910580	1911580	That is awesome.
1911580	1912580	Wow.
1912580	1913580	No, I'm like...
1913580	1914580	It's gross.
1914580	1915580	It's totally gross.
1915580	1916580	You guys are opening so many new doors here.
1916580	1917580	Yeah.
1917580	1918580	So you have a bite of a burger.
1918580	1923660	The teeth have already incised the burger and you have that on the bed.
1923660	1932420	And then you put crumbs on the little person's cheek that meets you, and let me finish.
1932420	1940580	And he's the spokesmodel for the restaurant, and his catchphrase is, I'm full.
1940580	1948220	You can finish it at over five locations now on Hollywood and Layton.
1948220	1950340	You can finish it.
1950340	1951540	There's our commercial, man.
1951540	1955700	Because his tiny tummy, his stomach is extra small.
1955700	1959500	Well, like, no, but that's cool because it's like a Chuck E. Cheese thing.
1959500	1961980	Everything looks like the one thing, the one guy, you know?
1961980	1965100	It's like if I had a ton of Chuck E. Cheese's at Chuck E. Cheese.
1965100	1966100	Yeah, yeah.
1966100	1967100	It's like that.
1967100	1968100	It's like they're all...
1968100	1970700	They all kind of look the same Oompa Loompas things, and yeah, and they're like, they take
1970700	1974020	bites out of the food, but, you know, they don't actually do that.
1974020	1976020	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
1976020	1978020	One more thing, and then we've got to keep the train moving.
1978020	1979020	But you didn't finish the kitchen.
1979020	1980020	I wanted to give you that kitchen update.
1980020	1981020	Well, I just think...
1981020	1983580	I just think, honestly, it's a non-solvent business because I...
1983580	1984580	You know what he always...
1984580	1988420	And I don't think you've thought it through because I think that the reason why Mexican
1988420	1992140	restaurants don't bother to go, fuck it, you can also get a fish sandwich here and
1992140	1996500	plus a pizza, is because they would have to then, like, it wouldn't be worth it for them.
1996500	1998620	You have to kind of like focus your menu.
1998620	2000700	Well, it's Little Cheesecake Factory, basically.
2000700	2001700	Right.
2001700	2002700	Well, you know, I feel like...
2002700	2004300	I mean, there's 50 things in that menu, right?
2004300	2008580	I feel like compromise, though, because what if now we make like a special food land.
2008580	2013220	So you enter food land, and there's like every restaurant in food land, kind of like the
2013220	2015180	Disney of dirt restaurants.
2015180	2019540	Because my dream was like, I wanted people to have whatever they wanted in one place.
2019540	2020540	Oh, right, right.
2020540	2021540	That was the dream.
2021540	2025260	And that's what Goldberg says, it's called the food court.
2025260	2028460	But food courts suck, and like, they don't have any good food.
2028460	2029460	And it's too big.
2029460	2031660	Yeah, I'm like, what the fuck do I get?
2031660	2034580	I'm going to eat a whole bowl of noodles?
2034580	2035580	Imagine entering...
2035580	2036660	What am I, a monster?
2036660	2040420	Imagine a glorious theme park where it's like, you know what I mean?
2040420	2043180	It's like you're visiting France, but you're actually eating French, you know?
2043180	2046700	So you're talking about Epcot Center.
2046700	2049860	You're talking about a miniaturized Legoland Epcot Center.
2049860	2050860	Wow.
2050860	2055420	Yeah, I guess I haven't been there, so that's probably what it's like.
2055420	2058820	All right, you look a good real Abbot, let's have a hand for real Abbot.
2058820	2059820	Thank you.
2059820	2060820	Thanks, everybody.
2060820	2061820	Thank you.
2061820	2062820	You can...
2062820	2063820	Come on.
2063820	2064820	Come on.
2064820	2065820	Come on.
2065820	2066820	Come on.
2066820	2067820	Come on.
2067820	2068820	Come on.
2068820	2069820	Me too.
2069820	2070820	It's nice.
2070820	2071820	I think...
2071820	2075140	Yeah, yeah, I guess why don't you take a hike too, Ridley?
2075140	2077500	Thank you for coming, Ryan Ridley.
2077500	2084300	That's how you get Ryan Ridley to come to your show, you give him some stage time.
2084300	2085300	It's nice.
2085300	2088540	I think everyone should create TV shows with their friends in them, because then who is
2088540	2092700	normally just normal Abbot becomes real Abbot.
2092700	2095900	And he was kind of an unreal guy before, and now whenever I see him, I go, hey, it's real
2095900	2096900	Abbot, man.
2096900	2097900	It's groovy.
2097900	2098900	I'm more really.
2098900	2099900	Yeah, exactly.
2099900	2100900	It's nice.
2100980	2101980	It's a nice...
2101980	2106060	You're welcome, Abbot, for the favor I did you, but...
2106060	2108900	Is there any part of you, Dan, that feels like...
2108900	2112540	What's your feeling about creating a character based on him?
2112540	2114900	Which version of that is your favorite?
2114900	2116900	Well, I mean, I...
2116900	2117900	What do you mean?
2117900	2118900	Do you like your creation?
2118900	2120500	Which Abbot do I like more?
2120500	2121500	Yeah.
2121500	2124100	Do you like your creation or do you like the inspiration?
2124100	2125100	No, come on.
2125100	2126100	Of course I like real Abbot.
2126100	2127100	He's real.
2127100	2128100	Oh, good.
2128100	2129100	Yeah.
2129100	2130100	Me too.
2131100	2138180	My favorite thing, we were at a party one time at Rob Shrobs' place, and Abbot was talking
2138180	2139580	to a person that had passed out.
2139580	2140580	Oh, god damn it.
2140580	2147180	There was a person that had completely fallen asleep and was like, head back, and Abbot,
2147180	2148180	you were breaking it down.
2148180	2152180	I didn't know he fell asleep.
2152180	2153180	Exactly.
2153180	2155980	Abbot just called out, I didn't know he fell asleep.
2155980	2156980	Exactly.
2156980	2158980	He was cutting the silhouette of a person sleeping.
2158980	2159980	He did look away.
2160860	2165260	He only lacked the disease coming out of his head.
2165260	2168860	The entire party started, so at a certain point we went like, look what's happening
2168860	2170820	over there.
2170820	2174540	And Abbot was just talking, there was just music playing, and he was talking to our friend
2174540	2177500	Rod, who was full on asleep.
2177500	2179060	And for real, like, not only...
2179060	2183700	This won't translate to the podcast, but seriously, not only talking to him, like, I guess you
2183700	2187300	could see, you're talking, you're lost in thought, so you don't notice every person listening.
2187300	2193420	But Abbot was making these expressions, he was going like...
2193420	2201460	He was somehow getting feedback from our unconscious friend, as Rod slowly slumped, like, before
2201460	2205940	he hit the floor, like, his head was like...
2205940	2210300	He looked like he was dead, his head was dangling, and Abbot was just talking to him like he
2210300	2212980	was on The View or something.
2212980	2213980	But the reason...
2213980	2214980	They were talking about work, I worked with them.
2214980	2216980	And it bored him, they were talking about work.
2216980	2221340	And the beauty of that thing, what was great about that moment is not that that was funny
2221340	2226460	and hilarious, I mean, it was, but like, I like the sound of my own voice, too, like,
2226460	2229740	I would love the freedom just to talk to a purpose for a while.
2229740	2235820	Or to, yeah, to not care that much, like, I repeat my story, we tell the same stories
2235820	2239940	in Harman Town a million times over, it'd be great just if you guys were all just mannequins.
2239940	2244300	We could tell the big jello story again, it'd be great.
2244300	2246300	It's like a superpower.
2247300	2250300	Let's keep the people that auditioned for the part of Abbot on Community Train rolling
2250300	2252300	and bring up Kumail Nanjiani.
2256300	2258300	It's a theme tonight.
2260300	2261300	I didn't know you auditioned for that.
2261300	2262300	Huh?
2262300	2263300	I didn't know you auditioned for that.
2263300	2266300	Yeah, I auditioned to be that guy.
2266300	2267300	How'd it go?
2267300	2270300	Well, I didn't get it, but I got pretty close.
2270300	2272300	Oh, yeah, for sure, man.
2272300	2274300	I would stay up at night going, fuck, did I...
2274300	2277300	Fuck, I mean, if it weren't for Danny Pudi and for real Abbot sitting in the audience
2277300	2280300	right now, I would tell you, like, man, second place.
2280300	2281300	I'd never...
2283300	2284300	Thank you.
2286300	2289300	I had never acted at that point, by the way.
2289300	2290300	That was my first...
2290300	2292300	When I auditioned for that, I had no fucking idea what I was doing.
2292300	2294300	And you were really nice.
2294300	2297300	I'd met you before a little bit and you came out to all of us and you were like, you know,
2297300	2299300	it's a really awkward, weird fucking process.
2299300	2300300	Sorry, we have to go through it.
2300300	2303300	You, like, apologize for the process, which nobody does.
2303300	2304300	Yeah.
2304300	2306300	That was very hard to work with.
2307300	2310300	Well, you gave me the wrong impression that day because I was like, oh, he's such an easygoing,
2310300	2311300	nice guy.
2311300	2312300	It's weird.
2312300	2313300	It's weird.
2313300	2314300	Yeah.
2314300	2320300	I can't decide if Abbot is Adam Goldberg light or if Adam Goldberg is Abbot light.
2320300	2321300	I don't know.
2321300	2322300	I don't know.
2322300	2326300	Like, there's a whole Rubik's Cube of humanity in our McDonald land.
2326300	2327300	It's crazy.
2328300	2330300	I'm going to open your...
2330300	2332300	You know Adam Goldberg's been playing hard to get.
2332300	2333300	Like, that's his new strategy.
2333300	2334300	No, he's not.
2334300	2339300	He retired from being a character at the Egyptian show and, like, he's playing it cool.
2339300	2340300	He's reverse psychology.
2340300	2342300	He's the gaming us.
2343300	2344300	Oh, yeah.
2344300	2347300	Next time he wears, like, a huge hat to Peacock.
2347300	2348300	Like, oh.
2348300	2349300	Ignore me.
2349300	2354300	I have noticed from Adam's behavior that he's obviously read weird, like, men's guides to
2354300	2358300	dating because he does things like he'll give you a gift.
2358300	2361300	But then two weeks later, he'll go, can I have that back?
2361300	2362300	And it's like, come on.
2362300	2368300	That had to come from some creepy, like, FHM, like, guide to getting her.
2368300	2371300	FHM.com slash approximate human behavior.
2371300	2374300	Like, yeah.
2378300	2379300	But now, yeah.
2379300	2380300	And he's just, he's cold-sholdering us.
2380300	2382300	I mean, no, he's sitting in the front.
2382300	2383300	He's in the second row.
2383300	2385300	He's the second row now, yeah.
2385300	2388300	No, I shouldn't say cold-sholdering us because he's not armed.
2388300	2389300	He's still piping up.
2389300	2390300	But, no, look at him.
2390300	2391300	He's got a healthy glow.
2391300	2392300	He's smiling.
2392300	2393300	He's having a good time.
2393300	2394300	He's making us jealous.
2394300	2399300	Like, he's showing up at the ex-girlfriend's party and being like, hey, what's up?
2399300	2403300	He just lifted up his sweater and showed us a Harman Town shirt underneath it.
2403300	2406300	There's something terrible about to happen.
2406300	2407300	You should listen to...
2407300	2411300	And underneath that shirt is clearly a bomb.
2411300	2418300	When you listen to his interview on the podcast cast, he gets deeply...
2419300	2424300	Aaron said she heard it and she was crying because it gets so personally revelatory.
2424300	2425300	I listened to him.
2425300	2426300	I was like, well, that's no.
2426300	2430300	It's like, Adam's like, you know, he's got a lot of my DNA.
2430300	2433300	Maybe 50 percent.
2433300	2434300	Abed or Adam?
2434300	2435300	Adam.
2435300	2436300	Adam, right.
2436300	2440300	He was like, you know, he's got one foot in, one foot out.
2440300	2441300	Like, when's he being self-deprecating?
2441300	2442300	Is he a narcissist?
2442300	2443300	Does he hate himself?
2443300	2444300	Blah, blah, blah.
2444300	2448300	He's telling the story of how Adam's a dungeon master.
2448300	2454300	Adam's origin story, when you peel back the comic book characters' lairs,
2454300	2457300	the night that Spencer came, that fateful night.
2457300	2460300	And Spencer raised his hand when we said, is there a dungeon master here?
2460300	2462300	Adam's a dungeon master.
2462300	2463300	And Adam wasn't here that night.
2463300	2464300	Oh, no.
2464300	2465300	There's always a Spencer.
2465300	2466300	For real?
2466300	2472300	And he has had to live with the agony of some hypothetical alternate timeline
2472300	2475300	where he is Spencer ever since.
2475300	2478300	The Phantom of the Opera.
2478300	2482300	Which includes him coming on tour with us.
2482300	2484300	The poster has his face on it.
2484300	2486300	Adam, you're a dungeon master?
2486300	2487300	Yep.
2487300	2490300	I have a story about it, but I'm playing hard to get, so I don't know.
2490300	2491300	Yeah, yeah.
2491300	2492300	That's not how you do it.
2492300	2494300	You can't say...
2494300	2497300	You can't reveal your strategy.
2497300	2498300	That kills it.
2498300	2500300	That should be rule number one.
2501300	2503300	Don't tell anyone you read this article.
2503300	2504300	Step two.
2504300	2508300	Because Camille, you played hard to get for a year and a half.
2508300	2510300	We had to ask you to come up on stage.
2510300	2511300	No, I didn't play hard to get.
2511300	2514300	I came because my wife started off producing the show.
2514300	2516300	It was her idea.
2516300	2517300	Yeah, it was her idea.
2517300	2519300	Dan Harmon, you should do a podcast.
2519300	2520300	Yeah.
2520300	2522300	It's not the light bulb.
2522300	2524300	I mean, everyone had a podcast already.
2524300	2526300	I was the last person to not have one.
2526300	2528300	She was like, come on, I feel bad for you.
2528300	2529300	She did.
2529300	2530300	Yeah.
2530300	2532300	Where is this going?
2532300	2533300	So I used to come and watch with her.
2533300	2535300	Because, you know, I really liked watching the show.
2535300	2537300	So I would come and hang out and watch the show for like a year.
2537300	2539300	But you had never played D&D before.
2539300	2540300	No.
2540300	2541300	But you're a gamer.
2541300	2542300	You love games, right?
2542300	2543300	Yeah.
2543300	2544300	You know, I grew up in Pakistan.
2544300	2545300	We didn't really have...
2545300	2547300	D&D wasn't really a thing.
2547300	2548300	Nobody I knew ever did.
2548300	2549300	Too close to home.
2554300	2557300	What do you think Pakistan is like?
2557300	2558300	Dragons?
2558300	2559300	Well, Dan Harmon.
2559300	2562300	I mean, you don't have first world problems, right?
2566300	2569300	By definition, we don't.
2570300	2571300	I thought...
2571300	2572300	Hey, listen.
2572300	2574300	All I know is what I read in my Noam Chomsky books.
2574300	2583300	I thought we had institutionalized a system of enforced, you know, like medieval, like
2583300	2586300	theocracy over there, like playing one end against the other and kind of...
2586300	2587300	Oh, yeah.
2587300	2591300	Keeping everyone east of a certain line in a place where...
2591300	2596300	Listen, now that you say, I guess Pakistan is closer to D&D land than Minnesota.
2596300	2597300	Yes.
2597300	2598300	Yes.
2598300	2599300	Less mitten spectrum.
2599300	2600300	Yeah, more caves.
2600300	2601300	Yeah, we have...
2601300	2602300	I'm not saying there's ogres there.
2602300	2603300	You're on the line.
2603300	2605300	Caves is right on the line.
2608300	2612300	I feel like I really want to argue with you guys, but I can't really find an argument
2612300	2613300	right now.
2614300	2615300	Well, it's an interesting...
2615300	2616300	It is.
2616300	2622300	Any obligation as a first world or privileged guy growing up in Wisconsin, am I a better
2622300	2631300	person if I acknowledge that the Middle East is a kind of artificially enforced kind of
2631300	2632300	medieval territory?
2632300	2633300	Well, I will...
2633300	2636300	Or am I a better person if I go, they're people too.
2636300	2637300	That's a great...
2637300	2638300	Oh, that's for the Fertile Crescent.
2638300	2639300	What a wonderful place.
2639300	2641300	The Paris of the planet.
2641300	2644300	I think there's a happy medium between those two.
2644300	2650300	The happy medium being that it's not medieval, and also it's not the Paris of the planet.
2650300	2654300	I think the happy medium would be, you know...
2654300	2659300	You and I grew up in a culture where we have so much free time that we can pretend to live
2659300	2660300	where life...
2660300	2664300	In a world where every corner you walk around, like a guy might chop you up with an axe.
2664300	2665300	Exactly.
2665300	2666300	Yeah.
2666300	2667300	Again, that's our fantasy.
2667300	2672300	I don't know how accurate that is per se.
2672300	2675300	I mean, I do have axe wounds all over me.
2675300	2679300	But if you're good at dodging, you can live to be, you know...
2679300	2682300	The average age is 19.
2682300	2684300	But that's including in foot mortality.
2684300	2685300	We all saw Argo.
2685300	2688300	We all know everything.
2688300	2694300	Dan, do you think Pakistan is more magical than Wisconsin?
2694300	2697300	It's more of all the territories over there.
2697300	2698300	Territories?
2698300	2701300	You mean countries?
2701300	2704300	Of all the territories?
2704300	2705300	Your tribes?
2705300	2707300	Of all the airstrips?
2707300	2708300	You mean my family?
2708300	2715300	And of all the military bases that we have over there, it is one of the more westernized
2715300	2719300	and has had a tradition of collaboration with...
2719300	2720300	Yeah, it's sort of...
2720300	2721300	The Great White Satan.
2721300	2724300	I would term it a frenemy of America.
2724300	2725300	A frenemy, yeah.
2725300	2727300	Yeah, frenemies.
2728300	2733300	It really is because a lot of the country, obviously, is against the west because it
2733300	2735300	sort of stands for everything.
2735300	2738300	The opposite of what sort of Islam stands for in a lot of ways.
2738300	2741300	But then also there's a big seduction of the west, you know.
2741300	2744300	So once we got MTV, like boys started wearing shorts.
2744300	2746300	So it's sort of a weird tussle.
2746300	2747300	It really is.
2747300	2750300	You saw the country change once MTV happened.
2750300	2751300	I saw it, yeah.
2751300	2755300	It was all over MTV.
2756300	2759300	Kurt Loder, you had the Pakistan transformation hour.
2763300	2765300	When 9-11 happened, there was like...
2765300	2768300	I really honestly can't recall the details, but I remember Pakistan was sort of front
2768300	2769300	and center in the headlines.
2769300	2770300	I think it had something to do with...
2770300	2771300	I could see that.
2771300	2772300	We needed...
2772300	2778300	You know, there's always like some country like Libya or like...
2778300	2784300	Something happens and America wants to maneuver something and then there's like some character
2784300	2786300	that no one's thought about for 10 years.
2786300	2787300	No one's used the word.
2787300	2790300	And I remember when 9-11 happened, it was like Pakistan, Pakistan, Pakistan.
2790300	2794300	Not for anything relating to anything other than like airspace or like something.
2794300	2795300	Wow.
2795300	2797300	So it's sort of like when I watched...
2797300	2798300	I know what you did last summer.
2798300	2800300	It kind of pissed me off that they were...
2800300	2804300	The murder was some fishermen that they wronged a year ago that you never saw.
2804300	2807300	So to you, Pakistan, is that fishermen.
2807300	2808300	Yeah, yeah.
2808300	2809300	Sorry, I haven't heard about this guy.
2809300	2812300	You were like, that fucking country, why?
2812300	2813300	But there was some kind of thing.
2813300	2815300	It was like, yeah, Pakistan was...
2815300	2816300	That was a safe house.
2816300	2819300	They were harboring Al-Qaeda or something like that, right?
2819300	2821300	And or helping us.
2821300	2823300	Like, you know, caught in between.
2823300	2825300	Was it Pakistan that had the...
2825300	2826300	No, that's Jordan.
2826300	2828300	Jordan was also like came to the forefront.
2828300	2829300	Jordan's gone.
2829300	2832300	Pakistan, we're still hanging on to our 15 minutes.
2832300	2835300	Remember the wake of 9-11?
2835300	2842300	Like this is like just speaks to like the first world like kind of like, I don't know.
2842300	2843300	God damn it.
2843300	2844300	What's the word?
2844300	2845300	What's the word?
2845300	2846300	Ethnocentrism?
2846300	2847300	Decadence.
2847300	2848300	Decadence.
2848300	2849300	Yeah.
2849300	2856300	I remember sitting in a restaurant and like in the wake of 9-11 and everything, what are
2856300	2857300	we going to do?
2857300	2861300	A lot of Middle Eastern talk and a lot of officials coming forward, presidents, prime ministers,
2862300	2865300	all of a sudden people who haven't thought about the Middle East in 10 years are watching
2865300	2867300	it on CNN and looking at like...
2867300	2872300	And the king of Jordan comes out and like he's got this wife and just like sitting there
2872300	2874300	eating a cheeseburger going like, she's hot.
2874300	2875300	Remember the...
2875300	2876300	Oh, yeah.
2876300	2878300	Queen of Jordan was like, oh, she's hot.
2878300	2879300	She was hot.
2879300	2880300	I don't know.
2880300	2882300	I thought that would get a bigger laugh.
2882300	2883300	No, I know.
2883300	2887300	Like this terrorist attack happened and there's like all of this like shit bubbling up, but
2887300	2888300	it was like, I couldn't even...
2888300	2890300	Well, what you do is you take something...
2891300	2894300	You take something big and you try and like digest it in the way you can.
2894300	2896300	Yeah, you're trying to turn it into an HBO mini-series.
2896300	2897300	Something that can make sense.
2897300	2898300	Do you remember...
2899300	2900300	Bites.
2904300	2906300	Do you remember when Saddam died?
2906300	2911300	When they killed Saddam, right before that they were like, oh, he really liked Doritos.
2912300	2914300	Why are you telling us that?
2914300	2916300	You already killed him.
2916300	2918300	If you want us to like him, don't...
2919300	2922300	You'd be like, turns out he likes Doritos, so stay of execution.
2922300	2924300	He's not so different.
2924300	2925300	They're like, we killed him, bad news.
2925300	2927300	He liked Doritos, just like you do.
2927300	2928300	Fuck.
2930300	2937300	While we're in this ticklish, sensitive, fun area, I remember you and I having a conversation
2937300	2942300	because you're an actor and you said you weren't back then, like that was your first audition
2942300	2943300	as an actor, but...
2943300	2947300	And since then, now you get a little acting career and a little, little.
2947300	2949300	Yeah, no, I heard the first little.
2951300	2955300	I like that it goes from the big, like making fun of where I'm from and my tribes to now
2955300	2957300	also the personal.
2957300	2958300	Yeah, now we're gonna go.
2958300	2959300	It's very thorough.
2959300	2960300	I've seen your bed where you sleep.
2960300	2961300	It's weird.
2962300	2963300	It's a straw.
2964300	2966300	It reminds me of home, Dan.
2967300	2975300	I remember we had a conversation about like the weird, like how, like, okay, a white actor
2976300	2978300	in America gets sides, gets an audition.
2978300	2983300	Hey, they need a guy to play the male lead's best friend.
2983300	2987300	He kind of wants to fuck his girlfriend, but he's half gay and he loves basketball.
2987300	2992300	So you come in and you go like the biggest struggle an American white actor has is you
2992300	2997300	go like, oh, this guy's kind of fratty, so I'm gonna put my spin on it, but whatever.
2997300	2998300	It's not written for me.
2998300	3000300	But then there's this whole other component happens.
3000300	3004300	If you're Asian, if you're Latin, if you're Middle Eastern, if you're whatever the other
3004300	3005300	things are.
3006300	3007300	Mordor.
3008300	3011300	Yeah, if you're an elf, if you're a dwarf, if you're, yeah.
3013300	3016300	I remember having a conversation that was kind of provocative and interesting, like
3016300	3020300	when we were talking about like you being like through no choice of your own, you're
3020300	3023300	at the forefront of that because you have to ask yourself as a person, obviously with
3023300	3030300	like a 350 IQ comes from comes from like, actually not a metric system, though.
3031300	3038300	Not only ethnically like having this cross to bear, but actually like you moved here
3038300	3042300	and are acting over here and now you get auditions.
3042300	3047300	So you go in and it's like, you know, you imagine the kinds of things like we all know.
3047300	3049300	Like it's like, oh, this guy is a quirky guy.
3049300	3052300	Like, yeah, we had a conversation about it, but I was drunk.
3052300	3055300	So like, I don't remember it, but I remember it being fascinating.
3055300	3056300	Maybe we could dig it up.
3056300	3059300	And I'm like, Dr. Frankenstein was just so in parts together.
3061300	3063300	I feel OK, so a long time.
3063300	3067300	First of all, when I first started auditioning, it was I was auditioning for a lot of parts
3067300	3073300	clearly that Aziz had gotten to before they were clearly written in his voice.
3073300	3075300	And I read like three cab drivers named Aziz.
3075300	3077300	I fucking swear that happened.
3077300	3078300	It's a fun name.
3078300	3079300	Yeah.
3080300	3081300	Yeah.
3081300	3083300	You imagine him swinging tree to tree then.
3086300	3087300	I'm sorry.
3087300	3088300	Cave to cave.
3090300	3091300	Thank you.
3091300	3092300	No.
3092300	3094300	Well, I think what it was.
3094300	3095300	Yeah.
3095300	3098300	So I do a lot of auditions now where it's still it's getting better.
3098300	3104300	But a lot of people sort of basically tell me to up my accent without saying it.
3104300	3105300	So I'll like do the auditions.
3105300	3106300	They're like, oh, that was great.
3106300	3107300	That was great.
3107300	3113300	Could you do it a little like even more like even more exaggerated?
3113300	3115300	I'm like, first of all, I'm not doing anything.
3115300	3116300	This is how I talk.
3117300	3123300	And I made a decision like two years ago where I was like, I'm not going to change my accent
3123300	3124300	for any of these auditions.
3124300	3127300	I've had a lot of auditions go well and they're like, all right, now try it this way.
3127300	3131300	And I get sort of upset and it becomes kind of obvious.
3131300	3132300	And so I have it.
3132300	3133300	But then I see fucking there's so many people.
3133300	3137300	I don't want to name names, but there's people that you know who are brown actors
3137300	3141300	who I'll audition with and I can fucking hear them in there.
3141300	3146300	They're like pissing on their legacy, like all doing all that shit.
3146300	3148300	It fucking pisses me off so much.
3148300	3151300	We're talking about Danny Pudi, right?
3151300	3154300	Fucking Danny Pudi.
3154300	3156300	But it always gets me that really angers me.
3156300	3159300	It's like it's like sort of like they're like scabs, you know, like, come on.
3159300	3160300	We're all in this together.
3160300	3161300	Don't fuck it.
3161300	3162300	And then they get the part.
3162300	3163300	Right.
3163300	3164300	Wow.
3164300	3169300	My ex-girlfriend, Erin Hill, when I was dating her, she was a media studies, getting her
3169300	3171300	master's degree, going for a PhD.
3171300	3173300	And she would spend all this time going through these archives.
3173300	3179300	And she uncovered this thing from probably the 40s or 50s, this Native American actor
3179300	3183300	who his headshot was like it was signed.
3183300	3186300	And he had a bowler hat with a feather in it.
3186300	3188300	One tear running down his face.
3188300	3189300	Well, that was the 70s.
3189300	3194300	That was when we actually started to go like, hey, these guys have clout now that they're
3194300	3195300	all dead.
3195300	3198300	Like, what if you made them cry?
3199300	3203300	Back then, it was still like, hey, they're funny.
3203300	3207300	Their houses are pointy.
3207300	3213300	His headshot was like signed, like, me want them commission for agentum.
3213300	3214300	Oh, God.
3214300	3220300	Much good wampum for, you know, obviously you could tell the guy was like a good guy.
3220300	3221300	Yeah.
3221300	3224300	He's like, how do I get the part?
3224300	3230300	And it's like hero or villain or the whole Hollywood shuffle thing.
3230300	3236300	But the interesting thing about it is the lack of like easy empirical truth.
3236300	3243300	Because if I'm an African American actor, like why don't I, for instance, have the right,
3243300	3249300	the same right that a Caucasian actor would have to affect a Brooklyn accent or take
3249300	3254300	advantage of the fact that I'm from Jersey or that I know what a southern person sounds
3254300	3261300	like in order to try to get some part according to Francis or whatever they're doing.
3261300	3266300	Now you're a black person and you're going in as an actor and it's like, well, this guy,
3266300	3269300	he's a little groovier, he's a little blacker than you're doing it and that's not how you
3269300	3271300	talk, but you're an actor.
3271300	3275300	It's a terrible thing to put someone in the position of.
3275300	3277300	Your craft is supposed to be pretending.
3277300	3281300	You're supposed to be able to pin medals to your chest to the extent that you're able
3281300	3288300	to portray different aspects of yourself and other people, imaginary people.
3288300	3293300	We give awards to people who do it, who remove us from reality more.
3293300	3298300	And so now, even though you didn't buy a ticket to that ride, here you are as an actor,
3298300	3303300	when all the other actors get to just go, I either get the part or I don't, you have to
3303300	3308300	tweak it in your head and go, well, I either get the part or I don't and there's way less
3308300	3309300	parts.
3309300	3315300	And on top of that, I have to fucking act like the one brown guy that people are comfortable
3315300	3316300	with.
3316300	3318300	Although a couple of things, one, I feel it changing.
3318300	3322300	I've been getting parts that were written for white guys and stuff, so it's changing.
3322300	3328300	And I do think, honestly, that the character Abad on Community did sort of change things
3328300	3332300	because it was a kind of brown guy that we hadn't seen on TV before.
3332300	3336300	And so when I read that, I was like, oh, when I watched the show, I was like, well, this
3336300	3337300	is great.
3337300	3338300	This is, you know, a new kind of brown guy that's going to change.
3338300	3342300	And then I read, like, the next pilot season, I read, like, five scripts that had, like,
3342300	3344300	basically Abad with different names.
3344300	3348300	A friend of mine that I won't name because I don't want to get in trouble, read a pilot
3348300	3355300	and it's, I don't even want to describe it because I don't want anyone to get in trouble.
3355300	3360300	But, like, there's a, according to this friend of mine, there's literally a point in the
3361300	3365300	script where the other characters are introduced to this kind of wacky ensemble.
3365300	3370300	And literally the names of the characters are Asian Lady and Fat Guy and, like, they
3370300	3371300	didn't do it.
3371300	3374300	It's like, whoa, it got home by three today, huh?
3374300	3375300	Crazy.
3375300	3379300	And I really think that if you're, you know, since the Harman Town audience I assume is
3379300	3383300	90 percent writers and 85 percent 25-year-old writers.
3383300	3389300	Like, I think that the way to break the cycle starts at the, starts at what I used to call
3390300	3391300	the typewriter.
3391300	3396300	Like, you, I think the key to it is, like, you have to avoid the temptation.
3396300	3401300	Like, with the Abad character in Community, that was the one exception in that script
3401300	3407300	where you actually bothered to explicitly say he says he's half Palestinian or something
3407300	3408300	like that.
3408300	3412300	Like, it was, it was in part, real Abad is half Palestinian and felt important to the
3412300	3414300	character to me for some reason.
3414300	3415300	Maybe I was right, maybe I was wrong.
3415300	3419300	It makes sense because he's a guy who's half, he's sort of obsessed with pop culture, but
3419300	3423300	then there's also this other part of him that sort of, it sort of makes him an observer,
3423300	3427300	even though it's not specifically a racial thing, but somebody who's sort of straddling
3427300	3428300	two cultures like that.
3428300	3429300	Maybe.
3429300	3430300	I mean, in retrospect.
3430300	3434300	But not, I mean, he could have been a white guy and it wouldn't have been, there was
3434300	3437300	one storyline with his dad that was a little specific to that.
3437300	3440300	In retrospect, he definitely could have been a white guy and he surely could have been
3440300	3444300	half Indian, half Polish, as which Diddy Pooty is, but at the time there was this whole,
3444300	3448300	not the whole brouhaha, but it's just like, I'm on Twitter and it's like, there's all
3448300	3451300	kinds of different viewpoints that come in and some, you know, justifiably some come
3451300	3455300	in and go, why, why do you have an Indian guy playing a half Indian guy playing a half
3455300	3456300	Arabic guy?
3456300	3457300	Like, like, what are you doing?
3457300	3459300	So all brown people, blah, blah, blah.
3459300	3460300	Very justifiable.
3460300	3461300	Absolutely.
3461300	3462300	But it didn't shake down that way.
3462300	3468300	You create a character, you say, okay, this is based on my friend, real Abad, whose dad
3468300	3471300	was Palestinian and whose mom was whatever Nordic or something.
3471300	3477300	And who had this very specific backstory to him, you know, his dad was like, like,
3477300	3481300	like it had really a lot to do with the relationship with his dad, which we did explore.
3481300	3488300	It was like his dad was not a fundamentalist Muslim, but a passionate one, a stern guy,
3488300	3491300	a kind of great Santini type in my head.
3491300	3496300	And that would be because father and son stories are very important to male characters that
3496300	3497300	that was important.
3497300	3500300	And it was like race isn't important.
3500300	3501300	That's an artificial construct.
3501300	3506300	But nationality of your parents could be called an important thing.
3506300	3510300	So then Danny Pooty walks in, fucking blows the roof off the room.
3510300	3511300	Okay.
3511300	3516300	Can we stop talking about how good he was in the audition?
3516300	3517300	We get it.
3517300	3519300	He got the part, Dan.
3519300	3520300	You know what?
3520300	3522300	I was really upset when I didn't get it.
3522300	3524300	But when I saw the show, I was like, oh, the right guy got it.
3524300	3525300	Anyway, go ahead.
3525300	3526300	No, I think that's the great thing about casting.
3526300	3527300	Yeah.
3527300	3528300	It's like, it's like, no one's going to feel bad about this.
3529300	3530300	It's like, let's all watch the fireworks.
3530300	3537300	But then, so later on, it's like the tweets coming in, it really vexed me because I'm
3537300	3540300	like, I've got all this white guilt and like, I want to be Norman Lear.
3540300	3542300	I don't want to be a bad person.
3542300	3545300	I want to use my talent right.
3545300	3546300	I want to contribute.
3546300	3548300	I want to make people happy.
3548300	3553300	And people are going like, why is this brown guy playing a different kind of brown guy
3553300	3556300	so torn between like, this is a slippery slope.
3557300	3559300	By the way, that's not an issue to me or anybody.
3559300	3561300	I mean, they're really, really...
3561300	3564300	I think it's a justifiable issue to some people, but it all depends on where you...
3564300	3566300	It all depends on the context.
3566300	3568300	Like, it really is...
3568300	3572300	It's such a strange time to be alive.
3572300	3576300	And I think that there is no magic wand to wave over it, no rule.
3576300	3581300	But I definitely think it starts with people writing scripts where you've got to detach
3581300	3583300	yourself from...
3583300	3587300	It's like, you're just going, oh, this character is amazing.
3587300	3589300	He's this big fat black guy.
3589300	3592300	But he talks like a little girl.
3592300	3593300	Isn't that a great character?
3593300	3594300	No, it's not.
3594300	3599300	Like, that's a great actor if that guy comes in and plays the character of...
3599300	3603300	Well, how important would it be to you if you changed the gender of people?
3603300	3605300	Well, that's where, yeah, where do you stop?
3605300	3610300	And it's like, do we progress to a weird Gene Roddenberry age where screenplays
3610300	3615300	are like ones and zeroes and you're kind of like, the rook has a problem with the pawn,
3615300	3617300	and they say, I don't know.
3617300	3619300	And does that mitigate creativity?
3619300	3620300	Does that mitigate passion?
3620300	3623300	Obviously, the answer is yes, because to the extent that you do that, then some punk rock writer
3623300	3630300	is going to go, two black dudes walk in, fucking script rules, whatever.
3630300	3632300	So we don't have to keep talking about that.
3632300	3635300	There is no finish line for that.
3635300	3638300	I think the discourse is the valuable thing.
3639300	3642300	I think that people talking about it is the only place that...
3642300	3646300	I think as long as you're aware of that, I think a lot of times, a lot of scripts I read,
3646300	3647300	it's just funny.
3647300	3648300	I can read it.
3648300	3649300	I'm like, oh, the line isn't funny.
3649300	3654300	It's funny because whoever wrote it in his head, heard it in an Appu accent or whatever.
3654300	3655300	That happens a lot.
3655300	3656300	And I've gone into...
3656300	3657300	I don't want to...
3657300	3659300	Ah, this is too specific.
3659300	3660300	We won't tell anybody.
3660300	3661300	All right, okay.
3661300	3665300	So this is very specific.
3665300	3668300	Can I tell you later to take it out if I decide...
3668300	3669300	is that okay?
3669300	3670300	I had this one...
3670300	3671300	You raped a baby.
3671300	3672300	I did this one movie.
3672300	3673300	What did you say?
3673300	3676300	You raped a baby.
3676300	3678300	TL, DR, something called it and whatever.
3678300	3682300	I wanted to rape a black baby, but then I was like, wait, who doesn't matter?
3682300	3683300	Gross.
3683300	3685300	He's Hispanic or whatever.
3685300	3686300	Some kind of...
3686300	3689300	Snickers.
3689300	3690300	It's a spot.
3690300	3691300	I'm sorry, we can't edit it out.
3691300	3694300	That's why we did our snickers spot.
3695300	3697300	They pay us a lot of money.
3697300	3698300	Sure design t-shirts.
3698300	3700300	So soft.
3700300	3705300	This thing we brought to you by Nabisco.
3705300	3708300	I had this movie that I didn't audition for.
3708300	3709300	They'd seen my stuff.
3709300	3710300	They liked it and it wasn't a huge part.
3710300	3712300	So I went in and the first day of shooting, they were like,
3712300	3714300	so how thick are you going to do your accent?
3714300	3716300	And I was like, well, I'm not going to do it thick at all.
3716300	3717300	And they were like, what do you mean?
3717300	3718300	It's written...
3718300	3720300	It's supposed to be a thick Indian accent.
3720300	3723300	I was like, well, I sort of have the 10-year-out-of-Pakistan accent
3723300	3724300	and that's what it's going to be.
3724300	3726300	So it became this huge thing.
3726300	3729300	Producers were calling it and stuff and I called my agent
3729300	3732300	and I was like, you know, I think they're going to fire me off this movie.
3732300	3737300	And I was like, I know I can make this part funny being myself with the lines,
3737300	3741300	but I don't know if I can make it funny if you want me to do like a crazy accent.
3741300	3742300	And then I just...
3742300	3745300	I was like, just let me do one the way I talk and then we can talk after that.
3745300	3747300	And it worked and it worked great and they were like, all right,
3747300	3748300	just do what you're doing.
3748300	3751300	So I think a lot of people are just scared of writing parts
3751300	3755300	or imagining parts that don't fit into whatever, you know,
3755300	3756300	their little boxes or whatever.
3756300	3757300	It's hard to see.
3757300	3758300	As we get...
3758300	3760300	You know, in the beginning, like there was a...
3760300	3762300	Now there are a lot of black characters on TV
3762300	3764300	and they're all sort of varied and different.
3764300	3766300	And I'm sure there's still strides to be made,
3766300	3767300	but there was an actor...
3767300	3768300	Emily was telling me about this.
3768300	3769300	There was an actor in...
3769300	3771300	When was it, Emily?
3771300	3774300	His name was Sleep and Eat is what he went by.
3774300	3775300	And his whole mythology...
3775300	3776300	Sleep and Eat.
3776300	3777300	Sleep and Eat.
3777300	3778300	Like Sleep and Eat.
3778300	3779300	Oh, Sleep and Eat.
3779300	3780300	He was an actor.
3780300	3782300	And his whole thing was just give me a place to sleep
3782300	3784300	and something to eat and I'll work for you.
3784300	3786300	Like he totally played up that hole.
3786300	3788300	He could step or fetch it.
3788300	3789300	Yeah.
3789300	3790300	It really was like that.
3790300	3791300	It was like that.
3791300	3792300	And so...
3792300	3793300	And that wasn't...
3793300	3794300	He wanted Wampum for his...
3794300	3795300	Yeah.
3795300	3798300	That wasn't that long ago, you know, and it's changed.
3798300	3799300	Yeah.
3799300	3801300	So on one side of it, yeah, you got writers.
3801300	3803300	Writers have got to do everything they can to go like,
3803300	3806300	okay, I'm going to create a character that's based on an emotional component.
3806300	3808300	And if there's biographical components, then that comes out of the watch.
3808300	3812300	And then on the actor's side, it's like, I think if you're the Meryl Streep of Pakistani actors,
3812300	3814300	then you could maybe fuck around with it.
3814300	3817300	They go like, could you lay the accent on a little more thick?
3817300	3819300	You go like, okay, I'm going to do that in a...
3819300	3823300	Based on my decades of studying all of these different kinds of...
3823300	3824300	You know what I mean?
3824300	3825300	Yeah.
3825300	3826300	For me, it was...
3826300	3828300	I decided not to do it because it was hard for me to parse
3828300	3831300	which parts were the guy had a thick accent and it made sense
3831300	3833300	and the story made sense for the character and which parts were...
3833300	3835300	Because that was going mostly for comedies.
3835300	3837300	Which parts were thick accent just because the guy thought
3837300	3842300	it would be funnier for a thick accent Indian guy to stay a motherfucker or whatever.
3842300	3845300	Or talk about Star Wars, which was like a big thing before.
3845300	3848300	That was why Abed was like an important thing to me was because it was like,
3848300	3851300	I want him to be the foremost expert.
3851300	3853300	Yes, he's going to be talking about pop culture.
3853300	3855300	It's not funny because he doesn't have an accent.
3855300	3856300	He's...
3856300	3858300	It's like before that...
3858300	3860300	He has an accent, it's the American accent.
3860300	3861300	Let me ask you a question.
3861300	3865300	When Batman fights Bob the Goon in issue number three, it's funny.
3865300	3868300	Listen to how he talks to you, he's not supposed to know about Star Wars.
3868300	3872300	That to me is kind of like a black guy in a dress.
3872300	3874300	It's all a part of the same tree.
3874300	3877300	It's like, okay, the character's not real.
3877300	3880300	But then also when you think of something like nerd,
3880300	3883300	the way that nerds are written a lot of times are also in a box.
3883300	3886300	So Star Wars is a good example.
3886300	3889300	I read so many scripts where someone is talking about Star Wars.
3889300	3891300	That's like, oh, they're a nerd, they're a nerd.
3891300	3892300	And I would always...
3892300	3894300	If I'm working on something and there's a Star Wars reference,
3894300	3896300	I'm like, that feels so generic.
3896300	3898300	That feels like you're just saying sci-fi.
3898300	3902300	Make it more specific, make it, you know, Lord of the Rings or something.
3902300	3905300	So for everything you do, there's these sort of pointers,
3905300	3909300	like little ways that you put people in boxes.
3909300	3912300	I believe you guys are here still.
3914300	3916300	Be a better writer and be a better actor,
3916300	3918300	and we'll all meet somewhere in between.
3918300	3921300	Speaking of characters and the unknown...
3921300	3923300	Let's pull my pants down.
3923300	3926300	Dan, whip that dick out on these people.
3926300	3930300	I want to show you these two characters, Clifford and Northumberland.
3931300	3933300	They're classics, they're classics.
3933300	3935300	Spencer, Spencer, will you come to the stage?
3935300	3937300	Spencer Crittenden is in...
3943300	3947300	Spencer Crittenden, Dragon Master extraordinaire.
3947300	3950300	Hey, I have something to ask Kumail while Spencer sets up.
3951300	3953300	We don't do anything very...
3953300	3956300	We're not a big plan-y podcast.
3956300	3960300	As a person, I don't make a lot of plans and contact a lot of people,
3960300	3963300	but this is your third time up here.
3965300	3968300	Are you bummed out that you have to keep coming up, or are you...?
3968300	3970300	No, I love being on stage with you guys.
3970300	3971300	It's always super fun.
3971300	3973300	Okay, because your character could fall off a cliff.
3973300	3976300	You don't have to... There's no pressure.
3976300	3980300	I would actually prefer if your character had maybe a little bit more...
3983300	3986300	What's the word I'm looking for, Dan?
3987300	3988300	I don't know.
3988300	3989300	Spice.
3989300	3990300	A little more...
3992300	3993300	You know what's funny?
3993300	3995300	Could you cave it up a little more?
3995300	3997300	Cave it up?
3998300	3999300	What's funny is...
3999300	4002300	For black actors, there is a phrase that always says,
4002300	4003300	Be more street.
4003300	4005300	That's what they say, or more urban.
4005300	4007300	For my people, there isn't that word yet.
4007300	4009300	Give us more attitude, attitude, black people here a lot.
4009300	4015300	For us, there isn't a set number of adjectives that you can use to really...
4015300	4017300	There must be some, certainly in casting offices.
4017300	4019300	They'll say even more...
4019300	4022300	Some people are stereotypical, obviously.
4022300	4024300	They say, yeah, that one's harsh.
4024300	4028300	One woman was like, all right, that's good, but even more funny.
4028300	4031300	But the way she said it was like, you know what I mean?
4032300	4033300	You know, like you people.
4033300	4034300	Could you be less...
4034300	4035300	They want me to do...
4035300	4040300	Could you be less 6, 10, and more, I don't know, 7, 11?
4043300	4046300	You're at an 8, need you at a 7, 11.
4046300	4049300	What I'm getting right now is like a B plus poo.
4049300	4050300	Yeah.
4051300	4053300	They really want you to do...
4053300	4057300	They really want you to do the Apu accent, which is voiced by a white guy.
4057300	4058300	Hilarious.
4058300	4062300	Their idea of an Indian accent is literally a white guy.
4063300	4064300	Anyway...
4065300	4067300	What did you think about...
4067300	4068300	God damn it, what's his name?
4068300	4070300	He's an awesome actor, monk.
4071300	4072300	Tony Shalhoub.
4072300	4074300	Did you see a quick change with Bill Murray?
4074300	4075300	I don't remember.
4075300	4076300	I saw it when I was a little kid.
4076300	4078300	He plays a cab driver in it.
4079300	4081300	Bad first impression.
4081300	4084300	And he plays a cab driver who doesn't speak English.
4084300	4085300	And he's like...
4085300	4086300	It's this farce.
4086300	4088300	Bill Murray's trying to get out of town.
4088300	4091300	He robbed a bank and now he just can't get out of New York.
4091300	4095300	And one of the complications is like...
4095300	4099300	Jason Robards plays this detective who's one step behind Bill Murray and he's trying to pick up his trail.
4099300	4101300	Tony Shalhoub played this...
4101300	4106300	Just on paper, he's a Middle Eastern cab driver.
4106300	4111300	He's one of the many things about New York that prevents you from getting out after a bank robbery.
4112300	4117300	And so he's witness to the fact that Randy Quaid fell out of the cab.
4118300	4121300	So Jason Robards is interrogating him.
4121300	4122300	Where did they go?
4122300	4123300	Where did they go?
4123300	4124300	And he's doing this mime stick.
4124300	4127300	On paper, it couldn't be more like...
4127300	4128300	He's going...
4128300	4129300	Bluff Tony!
4129300	4130300	Bluff Tony!
4130300	4131300	And he's miming honking a horn.
4131300	4134300	He's trying to tell them through his...
4134300	4138300	How is he a cab driver if we can't understand English?
4140300	4145300	I remember the first time realizing, watching Short Circuit, Fisher Stevens.
4145300	4147300	And being like, that's not...
4147300	4150300	I know what we look like and it's not that.
4155300	4158300	If you watch it, go rent Quick Change.
4158300	4164300	It's an amazing little 3 in the morning movie, snuggle up with your girlfriend or boyfriend.
4164300	4166300	Open-minded night.
4167300	4170300	Or your dog, but not... whatever.
4170300	4171300	It doesn't...
4171300	4173300	Don't fuck your dog.
4174300	4177300	And also, I'm not equating bestiality with homosexuality or with heterosexuality.
4177300	4180300	No, no, no, those were three distinct types of people.
4180300	4183300	Cuddle up with whatever you want to cuddle up with.
4183300	4184300	Or don't cuddle.
4184300	4187300	Hang upside down like a bat from a pool.
4187300	4190300	The point is not what you're doing, the point is the movie.
4190300	4194300	There's no wrong way to watch Quick Change is what you said.
4194300	4195300	I don't know.
4195300	4198300	I think fucking your dog and watching it might be...
4198300	4202300	I think that's bigger to the view, to say that.
4202300	4203300	Yeah, what if the dog's into it?
4203300	4204300	There are people...
4204300	4205300	Why is that a crime?
4205300	4207300	We have a lot of people that are going to hear this podcast,
4207300	4210300	and some of them may want to rape an animal while they watch Quick Change, and I say...
4210300	4211300	Well, rape is...
4211300	4213300	I say good for you.
4213300	4215300	No, rape, but consensual.
4215300	4216300	Rape, sensual, and what...
4216300	4219300	The important thing is that you watch Quick Change.
4220300	4221300	The animals aren't important here.
4221300	4223300	Different people are different priorities.
4223300	4226300	Right, a stereotypical Middle Eastern character while watching Quick Change.
4226300	4228300	Just watch Quick Change.
4228300	4235300	Tony Shalhoub walks into this character that is written as a sand trap of stereotypicality.
4235300	4236300	Sand trap.
4236300	4237300	He's no punny.
4237300	4238300	Wow.
4238300	4239300	I love that blue word.
4239300	4240300	All right.
4240300	4241300	Jesus Christ.
4241300	4245300	Okay, the reason I said that is because I didn't see it as a thing because I'm...
4245300	4246300	I don't think it was.
4246300	4247300	Three late golfs.
4247300	4248300	Parts of you saw it.
4248300	4249300	You're a big golfer.
4249300	4254300	Dan, this is the first golf finale you used in the entire run of the show.
4255300	4258300	Well, if racism is that unconscious, then hey...
4258300	4262300	He's trying to curry favor with the police officer.
4271300	4273300	Tony Shalhoub, who is...
4276300	4278300	Dan, you can salvage this.
4279300	4281300	Go watch it.
4281300	4282300	It's the scene.
4282300	4287300	Jason Robards is talking to this guy, this character that may as well be Mickey Rooney
4287300	4289300	in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
4289300	4290300	Oh, dear.
4290300	4294300	But Tony Shalhoub, who didn't say no to that audition...
4294300	4298300	I'm not at all flying in the face of anything that we've said.
4298300	4302300	But it's an interesting thing to look at because Tony Shalhoub...
4302300	4310300	He made some decision walking onto the set that,
4310300	4317300	look, I'm an actor and I'm going to make people feel this character's pain and frustration.
4317300	4321300	I'm not going to make them hear his funny accent and hear...
4321300	4325300	The only thing I can remember from that scene is,
4325300	4327300	Jesus Christ, this guy is so scared.
4327300	4332300	And so, like, he's alone and he doesn't watch out.
4332300	4335300	Like, it brings you to the brink of tears.
4335300	4339300	It's just supposed to be this stupid gag about this guy that talks funny.
4339300	4341300	But I'm telling you, like, take a look at it. Tell me if I'm wrong.
4341300	4342300	Email me, whatever.
4342300	4346300	Next time we just screen Quick Change.
4347300	4351300	And I can guarantee you, we'll get Tony Shalhoub for that one.
4351300	4353300	Oh, my God, that would be amazing.
4353300	4356300	Another thing I remember the first time being, like, watching this...
4356300	4359300	And as a kid, and being like, that's not right,
4359300	4362300	I think it was Bad Boys where there's a part where they're talking to, like,
4362300	4365300	a clerk at basically a 7-Eleven, whatever.
4365300	4368300	Do you remember that scene? And the guy calls him a mother bitch.
4368300	4373300	And I was like, oh, we know, everybody, if you know enough to know that bitch is a swear word
4373300	4377300	and that mother something is a swear word, you know it's motherfucker.
4377300	4380300	Mother bitch, nobody's ever said that.
4380300	4381300	It's funny, it's funny.
4381300	4385300	You guys are like Mad Libs. You don't know what you're doing.
4385300	4386300	Yeah.
4386300	4387300	Oh, you pussy.
4387300	4389300	Oh, my goodness, chicken hybrid.
4389300	4391300	Oh, you motherless dog.
4391300	4392300	I put a goat in your foot.
4392300	4395300	You chode punter.
4397300	4400300	Spencer, keep it the fuck down, would you?
4400300	4401300	Enough.
4401300	4402300	All right, we need enough.
4402300	4403300	Sorry.
4403300	4409300	We need a stool and a mic for Sadana Mulre.
4409300	4411300	Aaron McGathey for the stage, would you?
4411300	4418300	Spencer, get us up to date in our campaign, would you please?
4418300	4420300	Yeah, did anything happen last time?
4420300	4422300	Can you guys?
4425300	4428300	Did anything happen last time?
4428300	4431300	I have a vague memory.
4431300	4435300	I was in bed knitting Jeff a scarf, did anything happen?
4435300	4439300	Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, fuck your horse.
4440300	4442300	But also, I fucked Dan's bird and I fucked a squirrel.
4442300	4443300	I fucked a lot of things.
4443300	4445300	You fucked a half a dead zombie?
4445300	4447300	I fucked, yeah, I was...
4447300	4449300	I don't know if you fucked it in the appropriate part
4449300	4452300	or if you just fucked the way it got sliced.
4452300	4453300	It was unclear.
4453300	4456300	Madam Goldberg was texting me last week during the show,
4456300	4459300	live texting Jeff just fucked your horse.
4459300	4460300	And then Dustin Marshall was like...
4460300	4462300	Not a real horse, you know.
4465300	4466300	Spencer, take it away.
4466300	4468300	The horse is as real as the fucking it got.
4468300	4471300	I mean, yeah, relatively speaking.
4471300	4475300	When we last met, our heroes had been following Christoperk
4475300	4478300	the bard to the fabled ruins of Merchul,
4478300	4480300	home of the soul of growth.
4480300	4483300	After traveling for a time, day shifted tonight
4483300	4486300	and before long, the sound of unsettling moans and wails
4486300	4488300	echoed throughout the forest.
4488300	4491300	Less than cognizant of the impending threat,
4491300	4495300	our heroes took a rest break discussing music,
4495300	4498300	studying ancient tomes and fucking wildlife
4498300	4502300	until a grip of zombies were all but upon them.
4504300	4506300	Mulrain, who in a fey mood,
4506300	4509300	bargained with the party over her use of the Entangle spell,
4509300	4513300	eventually decided to use it and captured several zombies.
4513300	4516300	After making several concessions,
4516300	4519300	the party waited for the forest to do its bidding.
4519300	4521300	After entangling their foes,
4521300	4525300	the barbarian with the help of the new blood spell
4525300	4528300	cast by Sharpie made quick work
4528300	4530300	of the remaining zombie stranglers.
4530300	4532300	This is all going to shit.
4533300	4535300	The party pressed on before arriving
4535300	4539300	at an ancient crumbling ruin deep within the forests of Twyla.
4539300	4542300	So if you can see, I'm not even on the music.
4542300	4544300	I'm so sorry, everybody.
4544300	4546300	You got 26 seconds.
4547300	4548300	How are you feeling?
4548300	4549300	To say how you're feeling?
4549300	4553300	Walking through the ruins, you notice several stone statues
4553300	4557300	before you, lurking and guarding the ruins within.
4557300	4559300	Spencer, everybody.
4566300	4568300	Thanks, audience.
4569300	4572300	Okay, so it's Quark, Sharpie, Mulrain, and Krista Berg,
4572300	4578300	who he wrote and performed.
4578300	4579300	The Lady in Red.
4579300	4580300	Yeah, huge hit.
4580300	4581300	Yeah.
4582300	4585300	Career's kind of fallen on, you know, maybe a bit of a lull.
4585300	4587300	I would say so.
4588300	4590300	You certainly didn't expect that you'd find yourself here.
4590300	4591300	No, no, no.
4591300	4593300	I thought once I had Lady in Red, I was like,
4593300	4594300	oh, the world is more...
4594300	4596300	Like, I looked in the mirror and I was like,
4596300	4598300	this shit's too easy.
4598300	4600300	So now here you are.
4601300	4603300	You're standing outside of a stone ruin.
4603300	4605300	Who knows what's going to happen?
4605300	4608300	Yeah, I've heard horses being fucked.
4609300	4612300	Yeah, shit's gone off track.
4613300	4616300	All right, so I examine surroundings, Spencer.
4616300	4617300	The masonry appears ancient,
4617300	4620300	part of some long past ruined civilization.
4620300	4622300	Most prominent are worn and crumbling statues
4622300	4624300	stood on stone pedestals,
4624300	4627300	bearing the likeness of humanoids with bestial heads.
4627300	4629300	They appear to be dragon heads.
4629300	4631300	The statues flank a well-worn stone floor
4631300	4633300	that leads about 60 feet down
4633300	4635300	to a thick stand of tightly knit trees.
4635300	4637300	Between the trees is a small crevice
4637300	4640300	in the dead center of the clump of trees.
4640300	4641300	I find...
4641300	4642300	Sorry.
4642300	4644300	No, I was just saying go.
4644300	4645300	Sorry, everybody.
4645300	4646300	It's okay, Spencer.
4646300	4647300	Are we cool?
4647300	4649300	My self-esteem is just...
4649300	4652300	Spencer, you're a true dungeon master.
4652300	4653300	What's going on, Spencer?
4653300	4654300	You're the best.
4654300	4655300	What are you talking about?
4655300	4656300	People come for you.
4656300	4657300	I couldn't tell you.
4657300	4658300	I couldn't tell you.
4658300	4659300	What's going on?
4659300	4661300	I had a great day with Nolan.
4661300	4662300	Christopher?
4662300	4663300	I wish.
4663300	4666300	Yeah, what a name drop that would be.
4666300	4668300	He's just out there fucking hanging.
4668300	4669300	With Nolan?
4669300	4670300	Sitting on top of the Hollywood sign.
4670300	4672300	We're in talks for a forced Batman.
4672300	4674300	What if this H was in another H?
4674300	4676300	Oh, Christopher, you're amazing.
4682300	4683300	Yeah.
4683300	4684300	What was the question?
4684300	4685300	Who is Nolan?
4685300	4686300	Uh-huh.
4687300	4688300	He's there.
4688300	4690300	Spencer, you don't see yourself tonight.
4690300	4691300	What's going on?
4691300	4692300	Yeah, no.
4692300	4694300	We ate at Pink's Hot Dogs.
4696300	4699300	Did you get the Andouille dog?
4699300	4701300	I couldn't even tell you what I got.
4701300	4703300	It was like I thought I was going to get something,
4703300	4706300	and then I saw these little squares that said try these other things,
4706300	4707300	and I tried one of the other things.
4707300	4708300	You mean menus?
4708300	4709300	Spencer?
4709300	4711300	No, menus are lists.
4711300	4712300	What's the problem?
4712300	4715300	Was the problem that the hot dog was too big?
4717300	4721300	You might have just wanted a bite of the hot dog.
4723300	4724300	I'm still...
4724300	4725300	What?
4727300	4730300	So are you saying that your stomach's in little turmoil right now?
4730300	4731300	No, not at all.
4731300	4733300	Are you shit like a goose right now?
4733300	4735300	I'm past that phase.
4735300	4736300	Right.
4736300	4737300	That's done.
4737300	4741300	Spencer, did you have a good time at Dan and my Oscar party?
4741300	4742300	Oh, yeah.
4742300	4744300	You know how to throw a party, Aaron.
4747300	4748300	All right.
4748300	4749300	Well, noted.
4749300	4750300	I guess I'm...
4750300	4753300	Spencer, that was a good line reading.
4753300	4754300	Let's try it again.
4754300	4755300	Yeah.
4756300	4758300	This time, could you be a little more...
4760300	4763300	He's been to the same websites that Adam Goldberg's going to.
4763300	4764300	I wasn't fishing.
4764300	4766300	I really enjoyed the peanut butter cake.
4766300	4767300	It was good.
4767300	4768300	Yeah, I made peanut butter cake.
4768300	4770300	You know, you can make peanut butter cake.
4770300	4775300	Yeah, they don't have to be separate things that make you equally happy.
4775300	4778300	Like, you can actually have peanut butter and cake at the same time.
4778300	4779300	It was our tea day.
4779300	4780300	And I was like, Dan, what do you want?
4780300	4782300	And he was like, nah, peanut butter cake.
4782300	4783300	I was like, that's not real.
4784300	4785300	And then I googled it.
4785300	4787300	It was very real.
4787300	4790300	And I do admit I made it up, but I knew if you googled it, you...
4791300	4793300	I know there's going to be a thing.
4793300	4796300	Next week, it's going to be blowjob lollipop or something.
4796300	4798300	Well, I mean, that's already a real thing.
4798300	4800300	Every lollipop supports lollipop.
4800300	4801300	40 years of chronic masturbation.
4801300	4803300	If you Google it, it is there.
4804300	4808300	I knew peanut butter cake would be there if, like, cake farts is there.
4810300	4811300	Oh, man.
4811300	4815300	I find my horse, Coco, sitting at the bottom of a shower.
4818300	4819300	Wait.
4819300	4824300	My memory's a little foggy, but I'm pretty sure at some point it became consensual with Coco, right?
4824300	4825300	It became consensual.
4825300	4828300	This is the craziest thing anyone has ever said.
4828300	4829300	No, no.
4829300	4831300	She stopped resisting.
4832300	4833300	I never...
4833300	4834300	It became consensual.
4834300	4835300	She stopped crying.
4835300	4836300	I did not rape Coco.
4836300	4839300	I fucked Coco, and Coco dug it.
4839300	4840300	Did she? Okay.
4840300	4841300	Spencer?
4841300	4842300	What was Coco's stance on this?
4842300	4845300	If I recall, Coco, her Winnie's...
4849300	4850300	Nay means yay.
4856300	4859300	That is the best horse rape joke I've ever heard.
4859300	4860300	Oh, my God.
4860300	4861300	Oh, my God.
4863300	4864300	Show's over.
4865300	4867300	Best horse rape joke ever.
4867300	4868300	Yeah.
4869300	4870300	Nay means yay.
4870300	4871300	Nay means yay.
4872300	4873300	That's pretty good.
4873300	4876300	Meanwhile, statistically, 11 people in this room have been raped.
4877300	4878300	By Jeff.
4878300	4881300	By me, last week, and they fucking loved it.
4882300	4885300	Halfway through, they all started liking it.
4885300	4886300	The horse...
4886300	4888300	This is important.
4889300	4890300	Was it consensual?
4891300	4892300	The horse did orgasm.
4892300	4893300	Call the episode nay means yay?
4893300	4895300	Can we make that the name of the episode?
4895300	4896300	I'm in favor of that, yeah.
4896300	4897300	I don't know.
4897300	4898300	I don't know.
4898300	4899300	Are you rolling a dice to sleep with?
4899300	4901300	I randomly determined that it was consensual.
4901300	4903300	It was consensual, he says.
4903300	4904300	It was consensual?
4904300	4905300	Yeah.
4905300	4906300	See, one through three would have been non-consensual.
4906300	4907300	Oh, great.
4907300	4908300	I rolled a four through six.
4908300	4909300	So it was barely...
4909300	4911300	Yeah, barely consensual.
4911300	4914300	It wasn't critical consensuality.
4914300	4916300	She's had better.
4917300	4919300	I'm a gnome.
4921300	4924300	It's not the size of the barbarian.
4925300	4927300	It's the motion of the sword?
4927300	4929300	It's the motion of the potion.
4929300	4932300	She thought the wind was blowing strong.
4933300	4934300	Okay.
4934300	4935300	Well, no, that's good news.
4935300	4936300	That's good news.
4936300	4937300	Yeah.
4937300	4938300	No, Coco had a great time.
4938300	4939300	Fine.
4939300	4940300	Jesus, apparently.
4940300	4941300	Well, fantastic.
4941300	4943300	Look, I don't remember.
4943300	4944300	You don't remember?
4944300	4945300	Right, right, right, right.
4945300	4946300	So I led them here, right?
4946300	4947300	Yeah, yeah.
4947300	4949300	You were leading them here.
4949300	4950300	Zombies happened.
4950300	4951300	You took care of those.
4951300	4952300	Then you came around this room.
4952300	4953300	Yeah, I killed...
4953300	4954300	I hit a zombie.
4954300	4955300	Yeah.
4955300	4957300	It was my first hit in many years.
4960300	4961300	Hey, Chris.
4961300	4962300	Chris, let it go, man.
4962300	4964300	You're hung up on this.
4964300	4967300	Chris, as you're traveling on this journey,
4967300	4969300	do you have a soundtrack running in your mind?
4969300	4970300	Yeah.
4970300	4971300	Yeah?
4971300	4972300	What's happening right now?
4972300	4973300	It's Lady in Red.
4974300	4977300	All right, we're looking down a flight of stairs.
4977300	4978300	What?
4978300	4979300	It's down a flight of stairs.
4979300	4980300	Like, I'm not a visual thinker.
4980300	4981300	So, okay.
4981300	4985300	There's four statues, two on either side of this path.
4985300	4990300	The path goes to, like, what seems to be an unusually thick clump of trees.
4990300	4996300	And in this thick clump of trees, you can see, like, maybe a man-sized hole, like, in the trees.
4996300	4997300	Okay.
4997300	4998300	Which man?
4999300	5000300	Many different sizes.
5000300	5001300	Man.
5001300	5002300	Never mind.
5003300	5006300	So, that's in there is where the soul of growth is.
5006300	5008300	Yeah, you know that for sure, Christoperg?
5008300	5009300	Yeah.
5009300	5010300	Yeah.
5010300	5011300	Yeah.
5011300	5012300	I led you guys here.
5012300	5013300	I haven't led you astray yet.
5013300	5014300	It's in there.
5014300	5015300	All right.
5015300	5017300	Christoperg, why do you keep on signing all these trees
5017300	5019300	and you're putting your autograph on everything?
5019300	5020300	Dumb.
5020300	5021300	I'm sorry.
5021300	5022300	No.
5022300	5025300	Because I'm practicing for my, you know, inevitable second hit.
5025300	5026300	That was a bad setup.
5026300	5027300	I'm sorry.
5027300	5032300	Would you Willem Dafoe into this hole in kind of, like, platoon style?
5032300	5033300	Okay.
5033300	5040300	So, I do my best Willem Dafoe impression from platoon, and I go, see you in a week.
5040300	5042300	And that's from platoon.
5044300	5049300	And I turn a little, one of those Vietnam bendy flashlights that have a little red light,
5049300	5051300	and I jump down the hole.
5052300	5053300	Well, do you want to learn that?
5053300	5056300	Can I look for Vietnam bendy flashlight on Amazon?
5056300	5057300	I've got one.
5057300	5058300	Okay.
5058300	5059300	Yeah.
5059300	5060300	Do you want to light an actual torch?
5060300	5061300	Yes.
5061300	5062300	Okay.
5062300	5063300	I light an actual torch.
5063300	5066300	But he hates it.
5066300	5073300	Slipping through the hollow, you fall about 20 feet, landing at about three feet of thick
5073300	5075300	foul mud.
5075300	5079300	Below the mud is hard stone, and you can't see in the pitch black conditions.
5079300	5080300	Where's my torch?
5080300	5083300	It just plunged into this thick mud and went out.
5083300	5087300	I walk over, light a torch, and I want to throw it to him.
5087300	5088300	That happens.
5088300	5089300	Okay.
5089300	5092300	You see a torch falling from above.
5092300	5093300	Hey, torch!
5093300	5094300	Got it!
5094300	5095300	All right.
5095300	5098300	You grab the torch and hold it aloft.
5098300	5099300	Thanks, Christoper.
5099300	5100300	Yep.
5101300	5108300	The room is pretty narrow, but you can make out what seems to be a square in the far wall.
5108300	5110300	Try not to fuck it.
5114300	5117300	You know square peg, round hole, that kind of thing?
5117300	5118300	I should mention...
5118300	5121300	Look, I'm all fucked out from last week.
5121300	5126300	You also see several perfectly spherical fist-sized holes perforating the wall.
5126300	5128300	I fuck one of those holes.
5129300	5131300	The first one feels good.
5131300	5132300	No, it's...
5132300	5134300	The second one feels...
5134300	5137300	Slightly bitey.
5138300	5140300	It's too loose, ma'am.
5140300	5142300	You're not that big.
5143300	5144300	You can fist it.
5144300	5145300	I said fist-sized holes, man.
5145300	5146300	Okay.
5146300	5147300	I put my fist in the...
5147300	5148300	I fist a hole?
5148300	5149300	I'm not suggesting that hole.
5149300	5150300	What?
5150300	5151300	What am I, gross?
5151300	5154300	What is happening?
5154300	5155300	I...
5155300	5158300	Look, I see a hole shaped like a fist.
5158300	5161300	I put my fist in the hole.
5161300	5162300	Okay.
5162300	5163300	Yeah.
5163300	5165300	Fists in a hole, dude.
5166300	5173300	And then I rotate it 30 degrees to the right, then 40 degrees to the left.
5173300	5174300	I don't know.
5174300	5175300	You hear the far-off sound.
5175300	5177300	No, nothing happens.
5179300	5181300	Okay, I take my fist out of the hole.
5181300	5182300	Okay.
5182300	5183300	Hey, guys, come on down here.
5183300	5185300	There's a bunch of fist holes down here.
5185300	5187300	I think you might have rope.
5187300	5188300	Yeah, I mean...
5188300	5189300	I have a rope, guys.
5189300	5190300	We could use it to climb down.
5190300	5191300	Yeah.
5191300	5192300	You want to climb down?
5192300	5193300	Yeah.
5193300	5194300	Climb down the rope.
5194300	5196300	Climb into the darkness below.
5196300	5198300	You meet with Quark in the mud.
5198300	5200300	I use that staff with the button on it.
5200300	5202300	Using that staff with the button on it.
5202300	5205300	You climb into the hole where the people are.
5205300	5206300	Hey, guys.
5206300	5207300	I...
5207300	5209300	Did you use the staff with the button on it?
5209300	5213300	I pressed the button on Stick It, you know.
5213300	5215300	That's the trick.
5216300	5219300	I use...
5219300	5222300	I take one of my sacks,
5222300	5224300	and I throw it at the bottom of the hole,
5224300	5226300	and then I jump on the sack.
5226300	5227300	Like a landing pad.
5227300	5228300	Okay.
5228300	5229300	Is the dirt an issue here?
5229300	5230300	I had rope.
5230300	5231300	You could climb down.
5231300	5232300	Oh, okay.
5232300	5233300	And I uphold.
5233300	5235300	I realize I could use...
5235300	5237300	Can I use Chris's rope?
5237300	5238300	Yeah.
5238300	5239300	Oh, thank you so much.
5239300	5240300	Yeah, of course.
5240300	5241300	Thank you.
5241300	5243300	The rope's for everyone.
5244300	5246300	Also, there's three feet of mud down here.
5246300	5247300	I landed pretty softly.
5247300	5250300	You can kind of just hop on in here.
5250300	5252300	But, I mean, I have rope.
5254300	5255300	I will happily use your rope.
5255300	5258300	Guys, I examine the square at the end of the thing.
5258300	5261300	It appears to be some sort of wooden board.
5261300	5264300	It's caked with mud and is stuck fast to the wall.
5264300	5266300	I detect magic on it.
5266300	5267300	It is non-magic.
5267300	5269300	Oh, this isn't magic.
5270300	5273300	Does anybody have any thiefy, like, detect traps?
5273300	5274300	How much will it be?
5274300	5275300	Detect traps.
5275300	5276300	Should I do detect traps?
5276300	5279300	I mean, you can look for traps, totally.
5279300	5280300	All right.
5280300	5282300	I look for traps.
5282300	5284300	Totally.
5284300	5285300	Looking for traps.
5285300	5287300	You fail to find anything.
5287300	5289300	Those holes are kind of suspicious,
5289300	5291300	but you don't think they're traps.
5291300	5292300	How many holes are there?
5292300	5293300	There's several.
5293300	5295300	I mean, if you counted them,
5295300	5298300	you'd think it would be a waste of time.
5300300	5302300	I count the holes.
5306300	5309300	Never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight.
5309300	5311300	There are 76 holes.
5311300	5312300	Guys?
5312300	5313300	76?
5313300	5315300	Fist holes led the victim.
5317300	5319300	I think a bunch of people just came down here.
5319300	5321300	I think the first guy saw the wooden board,
5321300	5323300	detected traps and magic on it, and nothing happened.
5323300	5325300	And he was like, fuck, what do I do?
5325300	5326300	And he punched.
5326300	5328300	And then whatever happened to him happened.
5328300	5329300	And the next guy came down and said,
5329300	5330300	why is there a fist-sized hole?
5330300	5331300	It's got to be significant.
5331300	5332300	And then he punched like a bunch.
5332300	5333300	And then that kept happening.
5333300	5335300	76 guys.
5339300	5341300	So I kick the wooden square.
5341300	5343300	I kick it.
5343300	5345300	What's your strength?
5345300	5348300	Two million.
5348300	5349300	Nine.
5349300	5350300	I disagree.
5350300	5352300	It says minus one ability modifier.
5352300	5354300	Yeah, nine is a negative modifier.
5354300	5357300	Kicking the board, you feel it give a little bit,
5357300	5358300	but it doesn't budge.
5358300	5360300	I kick it, too.
5360300	5361300	What's your strength?
5361300	5364300	I'm 18 with a plus four ability modifier.
5364300	5366300	You kick it, too.
5366300	5368300	It bends it a bit better, but not much.
5368300	5371300	Can I call down Coco?
5371300	5372300	She is a horse.
5372300	5373300	Oh, yeah.
5373300	5376300	Can I fortify the wood?
5376300	5378300	What are you going to fight?
5378300	5379300	We're trying to break it.
5379300	5381300	Oh, I'm sorry.
5381300	5383300	I don't think Coco can fit down here.
5383300	5384300	I summon.
5384300	5385300	Really?
5385300	5388300	Because she kicked so hard.
5388300	5389300	Yeah.
5389300	5390300	Tell me about it.
5390300	5391300	It's fine.
5391300	5392300	She liked it.
5392300	5393300	It's fine.
5398300	5400300	She was trying to kick you off.
5400300	5403300	That's nothing to be proud of.
5403300	5405300	I like it and empowered.
5405300	5406300	It's fine.
5406300	5407300	I have a pretty high strength thing.
5407300	5409300	I have 13 plus one.
5409300	5410300	Okay.
5410300	5412300	Do you want to try and also kick it?
5412300	5414300	Do I have some sort of battering ram?
5414300	5415300	I mean, you don't.
5415300	5416300	You have, let's see.
5416300	5418300	I have an open lock thing.
5418300	5420300	Is it a lock of some sort?
5420300	5422300	You could look for a lock.
5422300	5423300	You fail to see a lock.
5423300	5426300	It just appears to be sealed with some sort of wax
5426300	5428300	or maybe glue to this wall.
5431300	5433300	I listen very carefully to the wood.
5433300	5435300	I can put my ear to it.
5435300	5437300	I can disable device.
5437300	5438300	Go first.
5438300	5439300	Go ahead.
5439300	5443300	You hear the faint sounds of hissing coming from some other floor far off.
5443300	5446300	Oh, snakes.
5446300	5449300	Why did it have to be snakes?
5449300	5452300	Spencer, I have no idea.
5452300	5455300	You know, I saw the first Indiana Jones one.
5455300	5456300	Oh, what did you think?
5456300	5457300	It was good.
5457300	5459300	It was good.
5459300	5461300	It wasn't like original.
5461300	5462300	And I mean, it was.
5462300	5463300	It wasn't that original?
5463300	5467300	Well, after seeing all of television biting it off for like years,
5467300	5471300	like you've seen literally every element represented in other things.
5472300	5473300	That's what I watch.
5473300	5474300	Easy Rider.
5474300	5475300	I'm like, what the fuck is?
5475300	5476300	Yeah.
5476300	5477300	Or like awesome.
5477300	5480300	But it was like it was like it was seeing all of it like throughout time.
5480300	5481300	I don't know.
5481300	5486300	Spencer, you know, you saw the movie Where I Live.
5486300	5490300	What did you think of my hosting when you were watching the movie?
5490300	5492300	Did you like it when you was my hosting?
5492300	5493300	Good.
5493300	5494300	It was great.
5497300	5499300	Can I love the party, Aaron?
5499300	5500300	That didn't sound good either.
5500300	5501300	I don't know how to.
5501300	5502300	You know what?
5502300	5503300	Spencer, just throw it away.
5503300	5505300	Just you're putting too much into it.
5505300	5507300	I really like the party.
5507300	5508300	Wait, what?
5508300	5510300	Just just throw it away.
5510300	5511300	You're thinking about it too much.
5511300	5512300	I had a party.
5512300	5513300	No.
5513300	5514300	I had a party.
5514300	5516300	I actually tried.
5516300	5518300	This is not going to work.
5518300	5519300	Fine.
5519300	5520300	I think we're doing two different bits.
5520300	5521300	I kick it also.
5521300	5523300	And I have 13 plus one strength.
5523300	5524300	OK, sorry.
5524300	5525300	I forgot everything.
5525300	5527300	We're just kicking a wood thing right now.
5527300	5528300	You kick it.
5528300	5529300	You see a few splinters.
5529300	5531300	You think it's almost broken.
5531300	5532300	Guys, it's almost broken.
5532300	5535300	By the way, I heard hissing on the other side of it.
5535300	5537300	Shit.
5537300	5541300	I use a rapid fire shot.
5541300	5547300	And I shoot two arrows at the burning hands.
5547300	5548300	Just don't.
5548300	5551300	My mom's here.
5551300	5554300	He's broken hearted over wanting you to use something.
5554300	5555300	I used two arrows.
5555300	5558300	I shoot them at either side of the frame.
5558300	5561300	They strike the board and plant fast in the board.
5561300	5563300	I think you just made the board stronger.
5563300	5564300	Yeah, sorry.
5564300	5565300	All right.
5565300	5567300	I got yelled at burning hands.
5567300	5569300	Can I cast burning hands on the board?
5569300	5571300	Casting burning hands on the board.
5571300	5572300	It is consumed in flames.
5572300	5575300	Hot shaw.
5575300	5578300	You see a hole about three feet in diameter.
5578300	5581300	It looks like it goes some distance.
5581300	5583300	Does my light spell have a range to it?
5583300	5585300	Can I cast a light?
5585300	5589300	You cast it on an object and it will make it glow like a torch.
5589300	5594300	I take one of my arrows, put a light on it, and I'll shoot it.
5594300	5595300	Nicely done.
5595300	5600300	You have arrows.
5600300	5602300	Yeah, I mean, I have arrows.
5602300	5603300	I have a hit song.
5603300	5606300	I've got a couple.
5606300	5611300	The hit song sort of arrowed to the top of the charts back in the day.
5611300	5615300	But I cast light on the tip of one of Krista Berg's arrows.
5615300	5618300	And I then in turn shoot that arrow.
5618300	5619300	Through the hole, right?
5619300	5621300	Through the hole, yeah.
5621300	5625300	Behind him, I like mime it.
5625300	5626300	Very sadly.
5626300	5630300	That was me that did it, not her.
5630300	5633300	But I mean through my mime encouragement.
5633300	5634300	Yeah, awesome.
5634300	5640300	I watched this all happen into a camera take and go.
5640300	5645300	And then Coco looks at him and takes her hoof and goes, down.
5645300	5647300	I fuck Coco again.
5647300	5648300	No, you're in the hole.
5648300	5649300	Coco's up there.
5649300	5652300	I climb the rope and fuck Coco.
5652300	5653300	No, I took the rope down.
5653300	5654300	It's my rope.
5654300	5657300	I take your Sharpie staff and I climb the staff.
5657300	5658300	Why do you need it?
5658300	5659300	He's just jangling for the ropes.
5659300	5663300	Sanctuary.
5663300	5666300	I shit on the ground for no reason.
5666300	5669300	Hey, how about the lighted arrow that I shot?
5669300	5671300	Firing the lighted arrow through the hole.
5671300	5672300	Let's focus.
5672300	5674300	Me fucking Coco's a B story.
5674300	5675300	Let's get back to the A story.
5675300	5679300	For a brief moment, you can see the floor being lit up.
5679300	5681300	There seems to be a mosaic scrawled across the floor.
5681300	5684300	It's big and green, but you're not sure what it's representing.
5684300	5688300	Because, you know, it glows and you're shooting it and then it plants in the wall.
5688300	5692300	So it plants in the far wall and you can see what appears to be a wooden door.
5692300	5695300	As well as a stone lever jetting out of the wall.
5695300	5697300	Do we see any snakes?
5697300	5698300	You don't see any snakes.
5698300	5702300	I pull the stone lever.
5702300	5704300	You are in a different room.
5704300	5706300	We're going to walk in.
5706300	5711300	As a gnome, am I small enough to squeeze through that small hole?
5711300	5712300	I think all of us can.
5712300	5715300	You can all go through, but not at the same time.
5715300	5718300	But Christoper has the power to detect traps.
5718300	5719300	Yeah.
5719300	5720300	I'll go in.
5720300	5721300	Not in a four chance sense.
5721300	5725300	I go in.
5725300	5731300	I go in and I detect traps.
5731300	5733300	That was a low roll, wasn't it?
5733300	5735300	It was actually you rolled an 18.
5735300	5737300	So that's a pretty good.
5737300	5738300	I don't know.
5738300	5741300	What's your do you see you should have a search check.
5741300	5743300	Do you have like on the skills?
5743300	5744300	Is there a number there?
5744300	5745300	Yeah, nine.
5745300	5746300	Awesome.
5746300	5747300	Okay.
5747300	5748300	It's nine.
5748300	5749300	It's nine.
5749300	5752300	It's still pretty good surveying the landscape.
5752300	5754300	You see a few oddities.
5754300	5756300	There's some scrape marks on the walls,
5756300	5761300	and you could see a few cracks in the ruins where roots poke out of the walls,
5761300	5763300	but they seem to be cut off.
5763300	5766300	It definitely seems like there might be some trap about,
5766300	5768300	but you can't determine its true nature.
5768300	5771300	Guys, I'm getting a weird vibe here.
5771300	5773300	There's vines that are out of the walls.
5773300	5776300	Somebody did cut the vines, but it seemed like they were attack vines.
5776300	5780300	Well, look where the vines are cut and see if there's like openings like,
5780300	5784300	you know, that penitent man will kneel shit from India to judge three.
5784300	5786300	I guess there's something that comes.
5786300	5789300	Are they cut because something comes out of the walls?
5789300	5791300	I'm just saying.
5791300	5795300	You could just see only the very like bits of them come out of the walls.
5795300	5798300	Like almost as soon as they come out of the walls,
5798300	5799300	that's where they're shorn off.
5799300	5800300	Right.
5800300	5801300	So something comes through here like a dick.
5801300	5803300	I have a trap sense too.
5803300	5805300	Can I add onto that?
5805300	5807300	You can search for trap.
5807300	5808300	I searched for traps.
5808300	5811300	You don't find a new trap.
5811300	5813300	Why don't you go fuck a horse?
5813300	5814300	Why don't you go fuck a horse?
5814300	5815300	You know what?
5815300	5819300	I don't mind if I do.
5819300	5820300	All right.
5820300	5821300	Well, let me see if I have a spelling.
5821300	5823300	Everybody back up out of here.
5823300	5828300	I think I have a spell that I can pull that lever from a remote distance.
5828300	5832300	And if I if I'm wrong about that, then I will have wasted your time.
5832300	5835300	So, Chris, do you have a lot of arrows?
5835300	5838300	I mean, I got, you know, mage hand, right?
5838300	5839300	Yeah.
5839300	5840300	Okay.
5840300	5841300	Everybody back up.
5841300	5842300	Back up.
5842300	5843300	If you have to take a shit, go take a shit.
5843300	5844300	Smoke them if you got them.
5844300	5845300	All right.
5845300	5848300	Everybody get out of the line of fire of this hole.
5848300	5852300	I'm going to I'm going to cast mage hand on the lever from safely outside the entrance
5852300	5856300	to the hole that whole tunnel and pull that lever.
5856300	5859300	You pull the lever at first nothing happens,
5859300	5863300	but then you see movement on the wooden door far down the hall.
5863300	5867300	It rumbles and then falls forward.
5867300	5870300	It hits the ground and shatters part of the mosaic,
5870300	5872300	causing a few cracks to run down its length.
5872300	5873300	Do you see behind the wall?
5873300	5877300	There is no doorway, but instead just a dead end.
5877300	5881300	Well, that's confusing.
5881300	5885300	This lever was a decoy lever, I think.
5885300	5887300	We're back in puzzle world.
5887300	5888300	Yeah.
5888300	5889300	We're running along.
5889300	5892300	Can we examine the mosaic before we do it?
5892300	5893300	Yeah.
5893300	5894300	Yeah.
5894300	5895300	We look at the mosaic.
5895300	5896300	Let's examine the mosaic at this point.
5896300	5897300	Only kumels in this room.
5897300	5898300	Oh, fuck.
5898300	5902300	You didn't wait for me to leave until you pull the lever and everybody get back.
5902300	5903300	Everybody get back.
5903300	5904300	Oh, I didn't hear you.
5904300	5905300	Okay.
5905300	5908300	So wait, you are now back in the room that you guys are in.
5908300	5909300	Yeah.
5909300	5910300	Yeah.
5910300	5911300	When he was like, get everyone, everyone get back.
5911300	5914300	I went back into this main standard room.
5914300	5915300	All right.
5915300	5917300	Well, I can go back in and look at the mosaic.
5917300	5918300	Okay.
5918300	5919300	So now you want to go back in and look at the mosaic.
5919300	5920300	Yeah.
5920300	5921300	I just want to see what it looks like.
5921300	5927300	It looks like there's a giant green serpentine, like perhaps a dragon.
5927300	5928300	Definitely a dragon.
5928300	5929300	I should take that back.
5929300	5930300	Guys.
5930300	5931300	It's definitely a dragon.
5931300	5937860	At first I thought it was like a snake kind of thing, but it's definitely a dragon.
5937860	5942580	Its mouth is open wide in aggression and you can see its mouth is just an entire slab of
5942580	5943980	ruby crystal.
5943980	5945860	Quirk should fuck it.
5945860	5948800	There's a ruby crystal.
5948800	5950180	Can I remove the ruby crystal?
5950180	5956940	I mean, do you want to, at this point you're still like near these guys, right?
5956940	5957940	I think we're running along.
5957940	5958940	Yeah.
5958940	5959940	We should come to a cliffhanger here.
5959940	5962100	Well, let's let this play out.
5962100	5964260	We came out at eight, 10.
5964260	5966020	It's 10 now.
5966020	5969100	That means, you know, we've put these people through worse.
5969100	5972260	What are they going to do?
5972260	5973260	Complain?
5973260	5977300	I can't, you know, yeah, that is exactly what they could do here.
5977300	5978300	I'll fix it.
5978300	5979300	Ladies and gentlemen.
5979420	5980420	Eric Idle's here.
5980420	5981420	No, he's not.
5981420	5982420	He's not.
5982420	5983420	He's not.
5983420	5984420	Sorry.
5984420	5986420	I thought that would bolster them for a second.
5986420	5990460	Well, that would be really funny if Eric Idle did come out then and he was just sitting
5990460	5993500	on it like, we're going to go really long.
5993500	5996820	But he's been here every week just in case we went too long.
5996820	5997820	Yeah.
5997820	5998820	He just comes with me.
5998820	6000820	He's the new me.
6000820	6003860	He comes up to me when I'm like three in the morning, I'm at Del Taco and they're like,
6003860	6005100	sir, could you please make up your mind?
6005100	6006100	I'm like, you know what?
6006100	6007100	Eric Idle's here.
6007100	6008100	He comes up.
6008100	6009100	Hello.
6009100	6010100	He's like, I don't.
6010100	6011100	Dan wants a taco.
6011100	6012100	Dan wants a taco.
6012100	6013100	Dan wants a taco.
6013100	6014100	No.
6014100	6020260	That was an homagi and mocking at the same time.
6020260	6023980	So can I remove, should I try and remove the ruby?
6023980	6024980	You don't.
6024980	6025980	Christopher.
6025980	6026980	Remove it.
6026980	6027980	Oh, it's a red ruby.
6027980	6028980	This is my specialty.
6028980	6032020	Ruby in red.
6032020	6034620	Who's that?
6034620	6037600	Looking at the ruby, you pry with all your might.
6037600	6046740	At the second you begin prying, you hear a rumbling sound behind you guys, guys.
6046740	6054620	You're the only one in the room at this point, guys, turning around behind you.
6054620	6062060	You see that a large stone wall is rumbled down, blocking your exit.
6062060	6066540	At the same time, you feel the giant ruby you've been grabbing move and jiggle a little
6066540	6069780	bit as if it's trying to pull itself free.
6069780	6074180	As if it's trying to pull itself free from my hands or it's from the thing it said.
6074180	6075180	From what you're doing.
6075180	6076500	I spoke dumb.
6076500	6081760	So it's, it's trying to re you're making progress, pulling the ruby out of the thing, but it's
6081760	6082760	not out yet.
6082760	6087180	I dive through the into the room with him as no, it's blocked.
6087180	6089820	I was slashing with my sword in a barbarian rage.
6089820	6091780	I tried to make it through to the room with Christopher.
6091780	6092780	Um, okay.
6092780	6097780	So you strike the rock surface with your sword, right?
6097780	6098780	Feels useless.
6098780	6101220	I'm like, I'm digging through.
6101220	6107220	I'm trying to get my, I try tunnel with my sword and make the lightest of scratches.
6107220	6111300	If I cast knock on it, does knock work on this knock wouldn't work on this is far too
6111300	6114900	heavy and I couldn't work on you openable.
6114900	6118600	Uh, so slowly.
6118600	6123720	The wall starts rumbling towards you threatening to crush you against the farmer's to get out
6123720	6124720	of there.
6124720	6125720	You son of a bitch.
6125720	6127440	Oh God.
6127440	6128440	Can they hear me?
6128440	6129440	Um, sure.
6129440	6130440	Guys.
6130440	6133440	These are my last words.
6133440	6134440	Lady.
6134440	6135440	Cliffhanger.
6135440	6136440	Okay.
6136440	6137440	Oh no.
6137440	6138440	Okay.
6138440	6153780	Thank you, Aaron.
6153780	6154780	Thank you.
6154780	6155780	Thank you.
6155780	6156780	Thank you.
6156780	6157780	Thank you.
6157780	6158780	Thank you.
6158780	6159780	Thank you.
6159780	6160780	Thank you.
6160780	6161780	Thank you.
6161780	6162780	Eric McGathey and Spencer.
6162780	6171100	That's a cliffhanger because now Christopher is just trapped in a crumbling room and we
6171100	6172900	were helpless to save him.
6172900	6173900	It's crazy.
6173900	6177060	I mean, it's Joseph Campbell would be very proud of us.
6177060	6179300	I think what stage would that be in a story you think?
6179300	6184300	I don't know the belly of the thing about what you're doing.
6184300	6186340	I'm just trying to get tangle free.
6186340	6191220	All right, Dan, let's, let's, let's, uh, what, what do you, uh, let's bring this ship into
6191220	6192220	the station.
6192220	6193220	Absolutely.
6193220	6194220	Talk about what we learned.
6194220	6197220	What did you learn?
6197220	6200900	I don't know, uh, go with the flow.
6200900	6203340	That's kind of easy to learn.
6203340	6208660	I learned that every week by having a show that pays nothing and that I don't care if
6208660	6209780	it goes good or bad.
6209780	6214340	Like I think that lesson just kind of continues.
6214340	6218340	It's like, like DC Pearson said, this is the reason movies don't continue past the end.
6218340	6221220	Like as a hero, I'm kind of done.
6221220	6222220	Yeah.
6222220	6223220	Yeah.
6223220	6224220	I liked it.
6224220	6225220	I like these guys.
6225220	6228180	I mean, if you were, if you were really courageous, you would just gently put the mic back in
6228180	6240420	a stand and walk off the stage and allow that to be the end of the show.
6240420	6253620	But let me ask you one thing.
6253620	6260460	No, no, no, that's not part you were supposed to just say you were supposed to just like
6260460	6261460	the master walks away.
6261460	6264460	It's not allowed suits that the master does his job and walks away from it.
6264460	6268980	You should just walk, walk away and leave these people with a confidence of knowing
6268980	6270620	that you've done your job.
6270620	6278780	What were you going to ask them?
6278780	6281300	What if it feels awkward?
6281300	6284300	It'll feel awkward if you let them know it's awkward.
6284300	6291460	You know, in the old days, the term break a leg comes from not from like, like, like
6291460	6292460	actor superstition.
6292460	6296660	It comes from make it to the end because bowing, where you break your back leg, like you kind
6296660	6297660	of bend your leg.
6297660	6301820	You make it to the end and it's lowering yourself to the audience and saying, thank
6301820	6302820	you for coming.
6302820	6305660	So like, if you just did a deep bow to the audience, like, thank you.
6305660	6309060	I thought it came from John Wilkes Booth breaking his leg after shooting the president in the
6309060	6310060	head.
6310060	6314060	No, he only, he broke an ankle.
6314060	6318060	That's like your leg.
6318060	6324420	I mean, the alternative is that you have to leave these people with some sort of special
6324420	6325420	message.
6326420	6327420	It's difficult.
6329420	6330420	It's lonely.
6332420	6335420	You're all by yourself out there.
6335420	6337420	These people paid $10.
6338420	6341420	Spencer drove from Simi Valley to be here.
6342420	6345420	There's a woman here from Estonia tonight.
6346420	6347420	Is that true?
6347420	6348420	No.
6348420	6354420	It's a lady.
6357420	6362420	In the beginning, there was nothing.
6362420	6367420	Nothing had an eternity to decide that nothing was worse than something.
6367420	6372420	Nothing split into a million somethings, AKA everything.
6372420	6375420	You were part of that everything.
6375420	6377420	So was the person next to you.
6379420	6394420	No matter who fires you, no matter whose laundry is left in your apartment complex is drier,
6394420	6396420	half dry.
6397420	6403420	No matter who writes notes on your company's refrigerators, Grey Poupon saying touch and
6403420	6409420	die, and then writes notes on the door of the fridge saying everything in here after
6409420	6412420	Friday will be thrown away.
6413420	6417420	No matter how many recycling bins you can't tell from regular bins.
6418420	6422420	No matter how many panes and your nuts and your kidney and your forehead and the back
6422420	6426420	of your neck, no matter how much hair you see in your shower drain.
6427420	6432420	No matter what you look like from the side in the mirror after you take a shit.
6438420	6443420	No matter what some crazy lady said about you that came back to you after you went out with her
6443420	6448420	for a week and then you found out she said something weird about you because you ran into someone at Kmart.
6457420	6460420	You are a citizen of Harmontown.
6461420	6463420	You belong.
6463420	6465420	You belong if you're human.
6466420	6472420	You belong if you leave your isms and your itises at the door.
6480420	6483420	Thank you for coming to Harmontown tonight.
6486420	6494420	Abed Gaeth, Ryan Ridley, Aaron McGathey, Camille Nantiani, Spencer Kretner.
6496420	6500420	Once again I'm Jeff Davis and your mayor Dan Harmon everyone.
6507420	6511420	And Lee Marvin everybody singing our new closing.
6516420	6525420	I was born under a modern star.
