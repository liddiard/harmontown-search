64880	71520	Dungeon master game blaster! He doesn't say pasta pasta!
71520	92160	Mr. Brandon Johnson! He's looking fresh tonight. So much show, so let's get down. You know the man's name, god damn it. Put your hands together for the mayor, Dan Holmer!
92160	112000	October Boo! Spooky, spooky show. Welcome to the spookiest show. October is the scariest month, you know.
112960	124640	I remember a ghost. I like to eat toast. It's a boring song. All right, let's uh...
124640	133440	What's going on everybody? You guys have a good weekend? Okay. Oh yeah. Yeah! I don't
133440	137600	have, I don't really have anything to talk about, so thanks for coming. But we
137600	141040	have some guests. We can we can chat with them. All kinds of stuff. You guys hear
141040	149040	about that Adams family? I mean I've heard about them. Yeah, those guys are crazy.
149040	156720	Like you mean, oh cuz it's October. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're nuts, man.
156720	162320	Oh yeah, they're all together ooky. Yeah. Yeah. They like attack each other.
162320	168320	We can't, so the Munsters came second, right? Like the Adams family was first. I'm pretty sure. And then the Munsters was like a go box.
168320	173120	The Adams family was like a comic strip. Yeah. And then they turned it into... And then Munsters were like,
173120	176240	anybody can do that. Yeah. You're doing it wrong. Who's the Frankenstein?
176960	182480	Lurch. That was the scientist's name. You see, that's the kind of snobby shit that's
182480	186400	gonna get all of those Adams family ex-pates from coming over to the Munster side. Well,
186400	188960	his name is Herman. Yeah.
188960	198560	I can make my own cable now. Like it doesn't even matter what kind.
198560	202080	Why are you doing that? What channels can you make?
206640	218240	Stupid. You're splicing cables? Yeah. Can you splice the Food Network with Comedy Central? Go.
218960	230240	Can you splice the History Channel with Nickelodeons? Nickelodeons. Go.
232080	244720	Can you splice, um, I don't know. I got it. I got it. Can you splice Spike TV with, uh, yeah, I'm done.
245680	250240	The reason for making your own cable is for cable management. You don't want to have a bunch of extra
250240	254000	loopy loops. You get a hundred feet of cable. What are the odds that you need to go a hundred feet
254000	259520	away? You know, you probably usually need 71 feet of cable. Right. You know, I got one 100 foot
259520	264400	cable. It had a bunch of extra going to the monitor I needed. Then I took all the extra,
264400	270880	and I just cut it through another connector on there. Took the extra slack that I cut off,
270880	275440	used that to keep the chain going to another monitor. It was really satisfying. I got, I, I
275440	281200	took that hundred foot, uh, cable and I, I turned it into a feed for three different monitors in my,
281200	290880	in my gym. Can you rewire my sound system? No. Oh, so you don't know how to. Well, I don't,
290880	294960	I actually don't know how to make audio cable yet. Yeah, that's true. Okay. I can't like,
295040	297280	I can only make coax. Well, call me when you're ready.
300160	302960	I think all music is just streamed now. I think you can just stream it.
304960	310400	Not, not when I'm watching a movie and the sounds coming through the speakers,
310400	317360	you can't stream that. Can you fix my sound system? I thought you did a great job when
317360	321840	I worked in Morty draft. Uh, good job. Thank you very much. I'm very proud of that.
322160	327680	Um, I'm glad you liked it. It was a pleasure to read. Thank you. Thank you. Reminding you that
327680	335120	I'm your boss. Um, uh, I don't know. Yeah. I got, I don't have to make up things to talk about.
335120	340880	It seems like I'd have a lot to talk about. We can talk about creep show. Uh, okay. Let's
340880	347840	talk about creep show. Rob's, Rob's creep show show called creep show on shutter, which is an app.
348800	352720	It's a streaming service here. A streaming, so who, who la la
355440	360240	a streaming service. Just let me have a fucking wind for two seconds.
361280	366320	You're like a fucking xenomorph. You let the compliment comes out and then you suck it back
366320	372480	in. I love when nerds fight because they say xenomorph. He could have just been like, you like
372480	377600	an asshole. You're a real dick right now. But you were like, man, you like Clark flap to the
377600	386320	fourth power bitch. All right. Thank you for standing up for me. I, I gave you props for
386320	392720	what could have been a basic put down, but was really extra. I was on your side. Good job. Until
392720	398960	now streaming service premiere. It's not my streaming service and the streaming service
398960	404000	didn't premiere my episode of the new show. All right. Yeah. It was a premiere on a streaming
404000	411520	service. Subscribe to shutter if you'd like. Yes. Spelled with D's not, not T's. It's not,
411520	418320	Oh my God, you can't. It's so difficult for you to compliment me. What the fuck? You're trying to
418320	427040	help them find it. Shutter. We've been talking about this since February. Go ahead. What?
427840	436880	What the fuck man? Keep, keep, keep my man made a spooky. Um, it's on this app streamer. It's called
436880	442240	shutter. It's spelled. I mean, I won't tell them how to spell it. Go to the app store,
442240	448560	download that shit. You probably get a free preview. Maybe you got a big promise. Some of
448560	454480	you pay them $5 a month later or something, but you probably time enough to watch shrubs episode.
455440	464640	It's pretty good. I liked it. You know what? He got to, he got to work with a bunch of his heroes,
464640	475040	Tom Savini. Yeah. Greg Nicotero, Jeffrey Combs, Kid Cudi, Kid Cudi. Tom Savini you'll, you'll,
475040	480960	you'll, you'll know from, I mean, that's the guy did all the, all the makeup for all the George Romero,
481920	486560	dead movies. And he also played in Dawn of the dead. He was like the leader
487760	493680	of the biker gang. He gets his sex machine and dust still done. Yeah. Sex machine and dust
493680	497120	still done. That's right. The guy with the little, the little gatling gun belt buckle. Yeah. That's
497120	503440	Tom Savini. Yeah. It's kind of cool. Pretty cool. It was really cool. It was amazing. Yeah. And he
503440	509120	was very nice. And his wife was very nice too. And we had a great time. Yeah. Kate was out.
509600	513280	That's what I was going to say. Speaking of wives. Kate, go ahead. No, that was it.
514720	521600	Kate, my, my, my wonderful, brilliant wife, uh, played the, the French. Yeah. She's all
521600	528720	over that thing. Yeah. She's did a tremendous job. I guess. Oh, okay. Very good. So take a look.
528720	536320	I hope you like it. And, uh, yeah, it, uh, I was, uh, pretty excited. I had a great time at your
536400	543360	older place. Did you get to meet Stephen King? Now, uh, met his son, Joe Hill, who wrote,
543360	548800	uh, Tom Savini's episode. Yeah. I met him. I didn't have to do that. I met him too.
549840	555840	He was in the original creep show. Yeah. He played a little boy that got slapped by Tom Atkins.
555840	563920	Wait, in what, which? Remember when the, the, the inst, the installment, the bookend where
563920	569280	Tom Atkins finds the comic book, he's the little boy. Oh, wow. Yeah. Wow. That's Joe Hill. Yeah.
569280	574640	Yeah. Huh. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. That's funny. Yeah, it is funny. Yeah. I mean, it's striking,
574640	579520	isn't it? I mean, sure. Joe Hill doesn't want us to, to, but you, you, you met him and you thought
579520	584000	the same thing I did, which is like, God damn though, Stephen King jeans are potent. Yeah.
585360	593440	Like, like what does, do you get 50% from each like parent or, or what, what in the hell,
593520	599040	looks and sounds a lot like. And I met his kids. Did you meet Joe's kids?
599040	603440	Cause it's like, you can see, it's like, oh, finally nature's getting a crowbar in there.
603440	609600	Like his kids only look like half Stephen King. Yeah. Uh, it's just striking. Like,
609600	615600	like, like how much, uh, I'm sure, I'm sure no, nobody wants to really hear that that much.
615600	620160	Although I don't mind. I look a lot like my dad and people would tell me that as I was growing up,
620160	624240	like, God damn, you look like your dad. And I would, I never took offense. Yeah. I look like my dad.
625120	630640	And Stephen King wrote, like, uh, if only I knew my dad. Damn.
633120	634560	Saint. I would enjoy your privilege.
640400	644480	Brandon, would it make you feel better if I brought out three white men? Yes.
644800	652400	All right. Our next guests are the founding fathers and hosts of the, uh, of I heart radios
652400	658000	stuff, stuff you should know networks. There's a lot of apostrophes in their chain. Um, uh,
658000	662480	but their podcast is stuff they don't want you to know. Please welcome Matt, Ben and Noel
663520	671200	from that podcast. You guys held your applause for last names. And I'm like, no,
672160	674560	hi guys. No problem.
677760	682880	I'm a bad, I'm a bad introducer. I said, please welcome Matt, Ben and Noel. And,
682880	686640	and they waited because they thought I was going to say it was just much farther away than we
686640	692560	realized farther away. Yeah. I thought, I thought you nailed it. Okay. Thank you. I don't.
693280	702320	I'm waiting to decide. So when I was much younger, Art Bell was still on the air with coast to coast
702320	708640	and, uh, he would, he would open up his lines to like alien abductees, time travelers,
708640	716320	and he'd talk about all the usual stuff and, uh, reptoids, uh, Hollerworth, Holla back.
716320	721120	There was typically, I think we were in a kind of a Camelot for a while, even when there were
721120	725840	Republican presidents is like, life was not so politically mired. It really didn't matter.
726480	732480	And Art Bell was so long ago and then his, his, uh, his, the, the throne's been handed
732480	738240	off and stuff. And it was just, I just recently listened to, this is my opening question. Uh,
738240	742000	I just recently listened to whoever, who's, who's the guy that took over for art?
742000	742720	George Norrie.
742720	747360	George. Yeah. I was listening to, I just happened across an episode of his show
747360	749920	maybe a couple of years ago and there was some guy that was like talking about,
750560	754320	you know, carnivorous plants or something and how they're, they're, they're still hiding their
754320	758080	existence in the Hollerworth or whatever he was talking about. And the guy was just going on and
758080	762000	on on the phone. And then he was like, and that's why they don't want you to believe in Donald Trump.
762000	766560	That's the thing. And he started because he's not part of the system and they're trying to
766560	772080	hold them back. And he got like, he got a couple sentences out and then George eventually, he's
772080	776560	just like, uh, Tom, Tom, Tom, I got to cut you off there. That's, I'm sorry, but that is the
776560	782160	one topic, the one topic we just can't talk about on this show. And I thought that was so striking
782160	788480	conspiracy theory culture. Like you got the, the, the, the, we are now living in this time when it's
788480	795680	like, uh, there's like eight ironies there that I can't describe. But anyways, I, you guys have
795680	801200	like this super intelligent kind of approach to talking about conspiracy theories. You, you,
801920	807040	you're, and, and that's what impresses me about your show. You keep it, you keep it, uh,
807040	812080	unmyered. You don't lose your wigs and you don't have call-ins from people that are like,
812080	816960	Hey, I just talked to him. We have a hotline. We do, we do, do call-in episodes or we play back the,
816960	822000	the most bad shit ones. It's just not live, just in case. And I guess that's just kind of how we
822000	827040	met is that I was commenting to Spencer. We were talking about that NPR, uh, the radio lab episode
827040	832320	where you and I were disagreeing. Yeah. And I brought these guys up. I just mentioned them
832320	836960	and said, uh, uh, you know, I've been, uh, as a hobbyist, I've been getting into
838320	844400	centrisms. No offense. I was always, I was just like, wow, these guys have been talking about this
844400	848160	topic for an hour and they haven't like, and then, and then you might, somebody must've told you guys
848160	852320	as they do on the internet, Dan Harmon talked about you or whatever. Then we, then now we met. Now
852320	856480	you're on the show. Um, Dan, ask them a question. Um, the, uh, how are you guys?
857360	864480	Well, pretty great. Yeah. This is, this is absurdly surreal. What is it like to be smart
864480	870560	and into conspiracy theories? Huh? Well loaded question. Yeah. Yeah. That's a,
870560	876640	you definitely framed us up there. Uh, yeah. I, uh, I, I, I can't think wrong. What do we call it?
876640	880800	We call it a critical thinking approach to conspiracy. Yeah. Which is an important distinction.
880800	887680	Yeah. Because so there's, uh, when I think any of us hear the term conspiracy theory,
887680	893280	especially now, and I appreciate that you pointed out this like schism that's occurring where the,
893280	897760	there are a bunch of very far right people who are now into conspiracy theories.
898320	901440	Yeah. Well, they always were, but they were never, I think it's the other way around it,
901440	904640	not to get derailed by this, but I almost feel like people that were fringe,
905680	909120	it was the same on the, on the left with the Bernie Sanders phenomenon. Is it people that
909120	914640	considered themselves fringe in the Camelot of the bipartisan days, people that were like,
914640	919520	what's with this election shit? And it was like, like the fringe got drawn into the,
920160	924960	to the process. And I think that like people that didn't know they were right wing 15 years ago,
925520	929360	figured out that they were, which was really disconcerting for me. Cause I'm like, Hey,
929360	933680	I wanted to talk about hollow earth and flat earth and anything, but I can't do it anymore.
933680	937520	When it's now it's connected directly to. Yeah. And that's why women should know.
937520	943600	Yeah. Cause there's always that plot twist and it happens to us a lot too. We'll be reading what,
943600	948080	what I think we all agree is a, like a fascinating correspondence or something
948080	951440	where someone has this really out there idea, but they've thought it through,
951440	957040	they have internal logic and we, we get into like paragraph four page four and they go,
957040	963120	and that's why Donald Trump, just like, just like George Nori runs into, um, we,
963120	968880	we prefer the term, uh, conspiracy realists because there's, there's insidious language
968880	973840	that happens. Uh, if you are on the new, or you're watching a new show a few years ago,
973840	980560	uh, someone would say the idea that international banks are laundering money for drug cartels
980560	985280	is a conspiracy theory. Uh, and then they would say that because it's sort of a thought
985280	991600	terminating cliche. And now all of a sudden saying, uh, that drug cartels are working with
991600	996160	banks to launder dirty money is the same thing as saying that the queen of England is somehow
996160	1001760	a half reptilian alien. And the difference is that one of those things is fucking true.
1001760	1008640	You know, see an alien. Yeah. I like the poutiness of it.
1011200	1017120	I knew it. Um, the, uh, yeah, no, that's a really good point. Um, the, uh, and you guys always
1017120	1022640	parse out your, your things, the structure of your show is that you, you kind of announce
1022640	1028960	the topic and then you, you, you say, here are the facts and you, you, you lay them all out.
1030080	1034800	And it is, it, I always find it kind of important to go like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It is, it is
1034800	1039680	important to keep those things separated that I can't, I can't think of a good example of a topic
1039680	1043680	where you're kind of like, yeah, I thought I knew the facts, but actually what's important is to
1043680	1048320	build a little box around what you know to be the case because it often contains a bunch of crazy
1048320	1054800	shit. And then you, you, you'll typically take a little break. Um, and then you usually will then
1054800	1060800	come back from that break and say, here's where it gets crazy. And then talk about the, the, the more,
1063040	1070960	unproven assertions that may be associated with those things. And, uh, so is that why you guys
1070960	1076560	got into it in the first place or is it among this, among this trio, is there a, are there
1076560	1082240	differing philosophies on this is, is, is, is Noel like a dude, there's a Bigfoot for real. And I have
1082240	1087040	to hang out with these fucking nerds just to get them to talk about it. Um, I don't know. Like,
1087040	1091120	I guess there's sort of, we do have kind of like different roles. I guess I'm sort of maybe more of
1091120	1096560	the skeptic. Matt's a bit more of a true believer about some of these things. I don't want to like
1096560	1101520	put words in your mouth. It has a lot to do with our background. Um, I grew up in, in the church
1101520	1108000	very heavily, uh, when I was growing up and, um, it was the United Methodist church. That's, uh,
1108000	1112320	where, how I got my start and I did too, but I think yours was a little more hardcore than mine.
1112320	1122640	Yeah, sure. Um, but core Methodist methodist, dude, um, those wafers. Um, so we, I, I lost my
1122640	1128080	religion as you know, many of us probably have a little bit at least when you get to college or
1128080	1133200	you're, you're really like, uh, getting more academic and, uh, you listen to pink fluid and
1133200	1138880	you're like, there's no way it got as well. I was honestly, I was listening to jars of clay
1138880	1142880	right up into college. Uh, like that kind of music, that record fucking slapped her, dude.
1145280	1149040	Yeah, no, it's all good. Yeah. That's just, that's just where I was. I mean, that's where I grew up
1149040	1154640	was in an isolated town in, uh, in Georgia called coming. It was literally called coming.
1154640	1161040	How's it spelled? It's U M M I N G it's for scythe county. It's one of the, uh, it was the most,
1161680	1168320	uh, I think it was, yeah, it was lightest. Well, certainly, but it was one of, it was one of the
1168320	1174800	most, um, conservative towns in all of America is, is where I grew up. It's, it's changed a little
1174800	1181200	bit at this point. Um, I'm not there anymore, but it, it shaped the way that I viewed the world,
1181200	1187120	all of just all of that. And it's just most of us where we're born and, um, the economic strata in
1187120	1192640	which we're born, it shapes us a lot. And the, the struggles that we go through, um, for me,
1192640	1199040	it was all internal because I was very privileged in, in my position. And the struggle was learning
1199040	1205840	that my worldview was not necessarily correct. And the things that I had based my entire life
1205840	1211440	on were not necessarily correct. And you came to conspiracy theory because you had been brainwashed
1211440	1218800	potentially. Well, I, I think I, yeah, I knew that there that had been pulled over my eyes and it
1218800	1224240	wasn't necessarily my fault. It was other people trying to shape me because they believed a certain
1224320	1229280	thing. Right. Um, at least that's how I ended up getting there. And I also spent a long,
1229280	1234960	a long, I felt five summers working at a private club in Atlanta where it was the most wealthy
1234960	1241680	people in all of Atlanta going to hang out and eat. She grabbed soup by the pool. And I really
1241680	1247520	didn't like what I felt there. I bet you heard the pool though. Did you not like, come on. You
1247520	1252160	had to have heard some, it was mostly griping about Pinot Grigio, but it was, um, I mean,
1252160	1256320	really influential, cool people, I'm sure. But, but it was, it shaped, it also shaped my worldview.
1256320	1263040	Anyway, I'm talking for too long. Uh, it can, conspiracy theories were this, uh, this window
1263040	1267840	that I could view the world through that, um, felt like there might be something there because
1267840	1272960	I couldn't trust what I believed in for so long that I should at least examine it. But that's the
1272960	1276720	thing too. Like with a lot of the things we look into, it's like, even as, as bonkers as they get,
1276720	1281440	there's usually a nugget of truth, like buried somewhere in there. And that's the part that's fun
1281440	1285440	about like, I consider it almost like a thought experiment. What we do sometimes when we talk
1285440	1290240	about this stuff, as opposed to being like a true believer, like a tin foil hat type. It's more like,
1290240	1294880	this is interesting. What do people think? What does the internet say? What's the science? How do
1294880	1299120	we get through all that to something that's real? And I think that's what we attempt to do anyway.
1299120	1303520	And it's sort of a false dichotomy too, to say that something has to be absolutely true
1303520	1309920	or absolutely false, right? It's, it's easy to say that it's comforting to say that, but it's
1309920	1317360	usually not the case, you know? Yeah. I mean, we look for, we look for meaning in chaos. I can do
1317360	1322400	the conspiracy theories are kind of, there's a conspiracy theory. If you call it something
1322400	1327920	different, it's a religion. I, you, you, you know, God conspired to, you know, this unseen forces
1327920	1332240	controlling the world. Like we, we fall back on the positive version of a conspiracy theory when
1332240	1338560	we lose a friend. And, uh, uh, and we, because the, the alternative is to stand there throwing dirt
1338560	1343680	onto somebody's box that should still be standing there. And, uh, what else are you going to do?
1343680	1349680	Is that the only reason why conspiracy theories get, get, get, get created? Uh, is it, is it,
1349680	1356000	is it just that like, uh, uh, need for control? I don't want to discount the other reason, which
1356000	1362160	would be that they're true. I, I don't, I don't want to, but I mean like the ones that like kind
1362160	1369360	of just blossom organically. Do they, do you, is that the, have you guys noticed anything in
1369360	1374480	your studies? Cause you've been doing this for over a decade, right? Um, like, do you have a
1374480	1381840	kind of unifying theory about how conspiracy theories get born? Uh, that's so that's, that's
1381840	1387680	a big one. Uh, yeah. So, uh, two things I really like that you pointed out that sometimes they are
1387680	1394640	true, right? Uh, not often, not near as often as the people calling coast to coast may want to
1394640	1402800	believe. Uh, but we see, we see two interesting things. First, uh, some conspiracy theory stuff
1402800	1409280	is ultimately classification and categorization, which are things that our species is brilliant
1409280	1416400	at. You know, we, we are hardwired to connect dots because, uh, back in the day that kept us alive.
1416720	1423120	And nothing really has changed with our neurochemistry. But the, uh, the second thing, uh,
1423120	1430640	you know, sometimes let's real quick. Sure. The reason we all know the term conspiracy theory
1430640	1438080	today is because the U S government sent out a memo after the assassination of Kennedy,
1438080	1443200	after the assassination of, uh, then president Kennedy and the memo sent to papers of note and
1443200	1448880	to broadcast radio said the following, they said, okay, this is the official story. This is what we
1448880	1454720	figured out. No, we're not, we don't have any secret smoky back rooms. Lyndon Johnson is
1455760	1461520	just a Dick. He's not some mastermind. And if you hear anything else other than this official
1461520	1466880	narrative, you are to call it a conspiracy theory. It's a term of abuse from the start. Like it's,
1466880	1471360	it's meant to discount everything that comes after, you know, that's, that's the whole point.
1471520	1476480	We sometimes say on the show, like, this isn't a conspiracy theory. This is a fucking conspiracy.
1476480	1480800	Yeah. That one's a thing. Sometimes you have to throw up our hands and say, well,
1480800	1483680	that one's true. What did happen to JFK?
1485280	1490400	May as well. While we're here. Yeah. I listened to, I listened to, can we do that? Can we throw
1490400	1496400	out conspiracy? I just did. Yeah. I'm saying we should do that. And then, and then Brandon should
1496400	1504560	do one. And then I can do one. I listened to none of you can do that because the Jews won't let you.
1505600	1512400	All right. So Dan, you started. I listened to a podcast where a guy said, like, his dad was
1512400	1518000	involved in like the state department and stuff. And he mentioned like, like stuff happened to
1518000	1522560	Kennedy. And I was like, I'm sure this is a lie, but it was just crazy. And obviously there's tons
1522560	1526720	and tons of conspiracies theories about, but this was someone purporting that to that their
1526720	1532480	family member was like talking some shit about shit he did to JFK. And that's just crazy.
1532480	1539840	Well, there's a, um, we can confirm he is dead. He did get shot. Sure. I agree with that. Those
1539840	1545280	are the facts. Those are, yeah, those are the facts. Uh, the facts are assassinations have happened.
1545280	1551440	Yeah. The fact is America has ordered them. Yeah. And the fact is there are, there are factions in
1551440	1557200	both, uh, the private industry and in the criminal industry, which is also private, I guess. And in
1557200	1563200	our own state supported at times, criminal industry that very much wanted, uh, that president out of
1563200	1568800	the picture, those things are true. But you know, one thing you have to be careful about when we put
1568800	1575600	all these puzzle pieces together is we have to remember that, um, in addition to being brilliant
1575600	1581840	at creating pattern or seeing some where none might actually exist, our species really,
1583440	1588640	really shits the bed when it comes to working together. So the idea that there would be,
1588640	1595520	there would be a nefarious shadowy empire that somehow, even though they're loggerheads,
1595520	1600480	every other goddamn day of the week, the fact that they would have some sort of Avengers level team
1600480	1608720	up is, uh, it asked for us to believe in a lot of good things about humanity that are, unfortunately,
1609440	1613760	that would be anomalous. It is especially funny now. Like I remember when I saw Oliver Stone's
1613760	1618880	movie, how terrified I was and how anti-government the whole thing made me. Cause I was just like,
1618880	1624640	he, it was, it was Camelot back then when that movie was made. And it was talking about a time
1624640	1631280	in which, uh, from the standpoint of that, that movie's production, it was like, uh, God damn,
1631280	1635920	can you imagine? Oh, the people that did this, they're, they're still watching there. They've
1635920	1641680	only gotten more powerful, but it's funny now I'm 46 and I live in this world where I'm thinking
1641680	1646800	about the idea of JFK getting assassinated. And I, I don't think this will offend anybody,
1646800	1650800	but I also don't want people to take this the wrong way, but it's almost like I'm, uh, I'm like,
1650800	1660000	God, how great that would be if our government was that powerful. Um, cause what, what have we
1660000	1664480	learned in the last two, three years? It's like, we've, we, we, we've been dissecting a pickled
1664480	1670880	frog. Um, we, we, we, we've been uncovering these things that, uh, that we're like, well,
1670880	1676240	that's impressive. That's complicated, but we're certainly learning. No one can start this thing's
1676240	1681040	heart. It's been soaked in formaldehyde. The fact that I'm looking inside of it is because
1681040	1688960	this frog is destroyed. It cannot hop. It cannot do anything. Um, it, it, it, we are,
1688960	1694320	we used to have three branches of government and right now, as of three years, look like, like,
1694320	1700720	we now have like 12 to 25, just like Game of Thrones factions. I'm, I'm sure it's temporary.
1700720	1706000	I hope it is. I hope the constitution holds up, but it's just amazing how, how quickly
1706000	1712320	you're reading headlines that say White House decision to pull out of this flummoxes the
1712320	1720000	Pentagon while the CIA accuses the FBI whistleblower of co-co-cooperating with the attorney general
1720000	1724160	who was doing this all for the Supreme court. I was like, God damn, I used, I used to panic
1724160	1728880	that all these dudes were out to get me together. I got out to get each other. They're too fucking
1728880	1732240	busy. I should knock over a bank. I think we're missing the, I think we're missing the big
1732240	1737440	question here. I stopped using my tour browser. Oh shit. I just want to know. I just want to
1737440	1742560	know what Moby knows. Okay. Cause he's got his finger on the pulse of all this shit. Like there
1742560	1746240	was a story that came out a year or so ago or Moby like talked some shit about how he was friends
1746240	1752160	with an NSA guy and knew that the Trump P tape was real and knew all this stuff. And then it just
1752160	1757360	came out as like a very buried lead in like a Rolling Stone article that in fact Moby is friends
1757360	1762640	with some deep leveled CIA types. And he was telling the truth. But it'll be funny if the guy
1762640	1769760	like tweeted those like, uh, friends, uh, we fucked. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't call it friends.
1770720	1776400	He gets reverse, uh, I wonder, you know, because that's, that goes, that's excellent point goes
1776400	1781840	back to, you know, the, the, the JFK question, which, uh, the thing that's so fascinating about
1781840	1787760	it is every time they think, ah, this is crazy. Then a little bit of something that actually
1787760	1792160	happened turns out to be true. Right? Like there's, there are always these, you know,
1792160	1797120	you could think of them as breadcrumbs. Uh, but I think that's why it remains one of the most
1797120	1804720	popular in any poll. How come you did not tell us what happened though? Moby, huh? No. What happened
1804720	1810240	to Kennedy? Yeah. Well, do you guys have any kind of like, this is their trick, man. You
1810240	1814080	are a harm in town, bro. You ain't going to be able to fudge your way out. Well, here's,
1814080	1817200	here's the deal with a lot of the things that we end up researching like this.
1817200	1821280	What you know, you get to the here's where, where it gets crazy part of our show and we have to
1821280	1826000	analyze 12 things that are, that are the possibilities of the theories that have been
1826000	1830720	approached with something like JFK being shot. And you, you kind of have to just weigh
1830720	1835280	what feels the most plausible, what feels the most possible. And that's generally what we do.
1835280	1838400	We have discussion about that, but you guys are myth busters. There's not a point at the end of
1838400	1843760	each episode where you go, Kennedy, boom, assassinated. We also don't agree actually on
1843760	1849520	this, this particular one. Okay. Well, now, all right. Okay. Power round. Go down the line. All
1849520	1858000	right. Tell us, tell us, tell us just cause myth to make you feel good. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well,
1858000	1862560	I'll just, okay. So what we're talking about overall is the compartmentalization of intelligence
1862560	1867280	agencies and you, you never want the left hand to know what the right hand is doing. If you're
1867280	1872240	going to do something in secret and that is, that's something that people who have been
1872240	1877760	creating intelligence agencies for a long time have been doing since the world wars, that's just
1877760	1885760	the way they run. And I believe that JFK was taken out for a lot of reasons. And I believe
1885760	1891840	personally, this does not mean it's true that it, that he was taken out by some small group of people
1892800	1897920	within, I'm just going to be as broad as I can within the deep state that took him out for reasons
1897920	1902000	that perhaps we don't even know. I think that makes a hundred percent sense, but I also don't
1902000	1908960	fucking know. I think it's really, I think it's really, really weird. It beggars belief to say
1908960	1915360	that Lee Harvey Oswald given connections with Russia and given his international passage
1915360	1922720	back and forth could have been a lone person. It's, it's also like, think about,
1924400	1930160	think about first off the fact that his records show he was a piss poor shot. Like that is,
1930160	1935680	that is clear. It's been confirmed by multiple sources. He's not some kind of, you know,
1935680	1941440	born candidate who, you know, he, or Manchurian candidate born identity Manchurian candidate.
1941440	1946880	Thank you. That's the one. Yeah. You know, I got the main words in there, but the, but the,
1946880	1957920	the idea I am of the belief that as much as we want to believe in state actors, often what purports
1957920	1965840	to be a state action is ultimately just like the state is the finger on the hand of a larger
1965840	1972400	private industry. And you know, wars are about resource extraction. Fuck idealism, honestly.
1972400	1977120	And when it gets to the back room, when the rubber hits the road. So I believe that there were
1977120	1986080	heavy private interests that were, let's say, if not directly, if not directly, like sending some,
1987040	1992000	you know, bank hit man or whatever to do some, some shady stuff. I believe that there were
1992000	1997920	private interests that were heavily involved and had the wherewithal to at least produce
1997920	2002480	an assassination really fast. Can we get into your background a little bit, Ben? Because this,
2002480	2007360	I think this is one of the reasons why our show is so interesting because Ben,
2007360	2012960	Ben was studying to perhaps, you know, do this kind to understand at least the way these things
2012960	2016240	function in the matter. We're going to be an assassin. Yeah. Yeah. He was going to be an
2016240	2025440	assassin. He's a great shot too. No, just book depository management. Yeah. Ben, you have a
2025440	2031600	working understanding of the way states function. So when Ben is telling you things like this,
2031600	2036000	a lot of times, you know, you may be a little skeptical listening to the things and take them
2036000	2040080	as fact, but Ben knows what he's talking about is what I'm trying to say. Throw me under the grass.
2040800	2045680	Well, I did. I got to say, I was listening to the Odessa episode just this morning,
2045680	2050960	and there was this like weird thing dropped in there about like, Ben, how many times have you
2050960	2057280	had to escape a country? And there was no laughter. And you just went, uh, uh, uh, seven, eight.
2062480	2070160	That is, that is, uh, primarily due to, uh, my, my poor planning skills, perhaps is the best way
2070160	2075280	to say it. Uh, I was originally, you know, in some universe to the left of ours, I'm,
2075280	2083360	I'm working for the state department, but in the course of, um, pursuing that as, as a career or
2083360	2091280	whatever, I mean, I, I, um, I quickly became disillusioned because I do not, I believe there
2091280	2097360	many great, it sounds great. This motherfucker is about to be like, we killed some people.
2098080	2104560	I know that we did. It's a good job if you want it. I think it's, I mean, podcasting, am I right?
2104560	2108800	Right. Right. That's where that's awesome. Shit that made you be like, this might not be the
2108800	2113680	job for me. Yeah. It's not, I mean, it's not, um, can't even talk about it right now. It's just not,
2115040	2118800	I'm, I'm torn. I'm torn Brandon, because I don't want to say,
2118800	2123680	I don't want to say that everyone who works in the state department or any of the alphabet
2123680	2128560	soups of agencies here. I don't want to say that they're automatically villains,
2128560	2133120	but I do want to say like, when you have a monolith, it's a banality of evil. When you
2133120	2139440	have this monolithic entity with such power and such influence and such reach, uh, then very
2139440	2144560	quickly, uh, morality becomes a matter of convenience and performance. Sure. And I,
2144560	2150000	I couldn't, I can't hang with that. It's gotta be a crazy, weird dental floss,
2150000	2157600	mobius floss thing. The idea that if you love America enough, undoubtedly what you probably
2157600	2163360	love is the idea of the democratic Republic, the idea of the thing that you're protecting.
2163360	2168800	Then I could see like crossing that threshold of like, I love that so much. I'm going to separate
2168800	2175280	myself from that in what I know and what I'm able to share. And I'm in even maybe some of what I do,
2175280	2180560	because Hey, that's how the sausage is made internationally and all these things. But then
2180560	2188000	it's like, I can only imagine like w where the deal breakers are. The greater good is the greater
2188000	2194320	good is like jam tomorrow. It's always a moving goalpost, you know, and people like no one thinks,
2194880	2200960	no one thinks, yeah, I'm the bad guy. History is going to hate me, man. I'm just going to go all
2200960	2209680	out. Everybody who, not everybody, but people who often do terrible, horrific, atrocious things
2209680	2215120	tend to think that they are doing it for a greater good. They feel like they're, you know, rust coal.
2215120	2219840	They're like the bad men who keep the other bad men from the door. And that's just not true.
2219840	2224960	They're regular people doing bad things, you know? And, and when you're just like you said,
2225360	2227280	does Trump have a time machine?
2232560	2238640	Yeah. Trump's uncle still leaving. Where's the booze? Is it?
2239920	2246880	Yeah. Was it Trump's uncle? Like was, was like deciphering Tesla's
2248000	2251840	like notes and stuff like that. And, and he found the secret said,
2251840	2256320	yeah, hell yeah. Steve, leave me, leave me ladies and gentlemen, Steve,
2256320	2260640	secret of time travel. Do you know what I'm talking about? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Buckle up.
2261360	2264880	All right. So I actually do want to get on into something that we've, we've talked about
2264880	2271280	before on the show. And that is the concept of gaming out what could possibly happen using
2271280	2279760	simulations on a global scale of governments of populations and the way a certain what X factor.
2279760	2282080	We're going to hear about time machines. No, but this is what I'm telling. We're
2282080	2287440	talking about time machines. This is the setup. This is almost a time machine where if, imagine
2287440	2292560	you had a simulator of the world and global politics where you could, you could see what
2292560	2298720	happens if you could run a simulation. If there's unrest in Nicaragua or something for some reason,
2298720	2304320	or if we happen to invade Iran next week, what would occur? What, what all the, what would the
2304320	2308080	puzzle pieces look like from that point forward? If you could do that effectively enough and
2308080	2312960	accurately enough, you could essentially have a time machine or at least a crystal ball. Yeah.
2312960	2319200	A version of it to where you could decide precisely which actions you could take. And then,
2319200	2323280	you know, a through Z. Certainly even the public information that we have about Cambridge
2323280	2329120	Analytica, like, like, like that's only what we know that, that, that AI is already getting to
2329120	2333520	that point to the extent that we are online, to the extent that we behave in swarms, the extent that.
2334080	2340320	But, but, but, but he's talking about a specific, you're right. You're right. Come on, man. You can't
2340320	2346320	go. It's kind of a time machine. So are you talking about basically, you know what I'm talking
2346320	2352720	about? You're talking about physically transporting someone through. Have you heard this? I heard it,
2352720	2357040	but there's, if that kind of thing exists, there's no fucking way that guy could figure out how to
2357040	2363440	operate. But the theory is the reason his brain is melting is because time travel is cancer.
2363520	2376640	I mean, he's losing his fucking mind. Well, okay. So first off, I would watch that fringe episode,
2376640	2379680	but so what end like, how is this like helping him out? Like, how is this time?
2381840	2386880	He would look like Biff from back of the future too. I mean, he would be a pawn. That's the scary
2386880	2390800	thing about this morning's headline where he, I don't even fucking understand enough about the
2390800	2395600	reason to know that he, that he pulled troops out of this and the, the, some people are going,
2395600	2400400	why'd you do that? And it's just like flashed over this time travel theory where it's like,
2400400	2406160	this guy's just some Biff Tannen that's been like fucking thrust into the gearworks by,
2406160	2412560	it's like, it's not by his design. If he had a time machine, he would have just invented cocaine.
2414560	2419120	He would just be hanging out. He'd be, he'd have a successful hot tub company and he'd be like
2419120	2423680	blowing David Hasselhoff. He'd be fine. And he'd have the dog track numbers or something. Yeah.
2423680	2431600	Or he'd be like part of some island. Yeah. But, but, but he's not, it's like, he's, he's very like,
2431600	2440320	he, like it is easy to believe in him as like a fucking crazy, like monkey wrench that an alien
2440320	2445840	or a time traveler would just blue casually knock in, not, not throughout just random,
2445840	2450720	like rhinestone cowboy, like the next guy that walks in the door and like, I've got to bet the
2450720	2455680	like, but big by virtue of his sheer proximity, as Spencer's pointed out many times, Donald Trump
2455680	2461200	had been running for president for 25 years. There's like, we, he constantly was running for
2461200	2467600	president. He, and then, and then finally like these, like he did, it's like if you look at the
2467600	2473840	swarming behaviors and things like, but him winning and the way he won and things and then,
2473840	2479600	and now the things he's doing, it's just like, it does lend itself to a crazy cosmic theory. Like
2479600	2487120	you can't imagine anyone, but a fallen angel or a robot profiting. So it's like evil Promethean
2487120	2491280	figure bringing, and the way that we're all kind of going like, like, like you remember minority
2491280	2497280	report when she's like walking Tom Cruise through the mall and she's like, duck now get an ice cream
2497280	2502720	now all these things, because she can see a little bit into the future. And when you, so if you look
2502720	2511600	at Tom Cruise's behavior as he's being Cyrano'd by this precog, his behavior per our observation
2511600	2516960	is crazy, right? Because it's like, now browse this magazine, now do this, now be random, put
2516960	2524480	on this hat, duck, buy a balloon, hold this, pause three seconds, now move forward. That's Donald
2524480	2530320	Trump. Like, like, and it's also our reaction. Like, like, the way that we're reacting to him
2530320	2535520	being president reminds me of all of the people in the mall and minority report that we're, we're
2535520	2542640	always just, just shy of going like, wait a minute. What the fuck? You can't spell every time. We're
2542640	2546560	always just like, like, well, he can't, he could never spell. I don't know. I've got to get a
2546560	2551120	greeting card. It's always been true, right? It's just like, there's never, the swarm never
2552080	2556320	works. And it's almost like there's been this tipping point now, which scares me more. That's
2556320	2564720	like, we're seeing this shift. It feels like time's up. Like, which makes me think the bomb
2564720	2569120	is armed. So the Russians have a time machine, right? That they use to influence the election.
2569120	2574000	That Baron Trump. Yeah. And Nikola Tesla somehow is involved. And the tweets are code. You know
2574000	2578400	what I'm talking about? I know who he is. There's this book in the 1900s, early 1900s,
2578400	2583600	that talks about this character who's a Trump and he meets a grand master who calls himself the Don
2583600	2589520	and he takes him through time and he has a son. No, it was Baron Trump was the Trump, right? And
2589520	2594800	there's just these similarities in the book. And then it's in a YouTube video, but the YouTube
2594800	2599280	video is kind of the thing where they kind of put their finger on the scale where they make it feel
2599280	2603520	a bit closer. And then they use them things that aren't true to kind of connect the dots a little
2603520	2607680	harder than they're connecting. But the end result is there's this book in the 1900s. That's like,
2607680	2611600	there's this Trump guy and he becomes the president of the world. And it's in this place.
2611600	2616480	It's like he has a mansion on, on whatever the place the actual Trump tower is. And so there's
2616480	2620960	these weird connections, right? So Trump, so we're talking about, yeah, yeah, yeah. Is that book real?
2620960	2626720	I mean, the book's real. It's a book, a book is called the last president. Wow. Well, you guys
2626720	2632720	remember when the last president, like all of the, all of the rumors and things that were going on
2632720	2638160	where people were like, Oh, that guy's definitely the antichrist. Oh, that guy's definitely, you know,
2638160	2644800	so much more about Clinton and Obama than they should about the guy. Yeah. I read revelations.
2645360	2652720	Trump has a wound on his head that he survived scalp surgery. Anyways. I remember. Yeah. I
2652720	2656880	guess what I'm trying to get at is anytime there's somebody in power, we, we tend to distrust
2658400	2662960	enough. It's just how we view authority a lot of times. And I'm not speaking for everyone,
2662960	2668000	of course, but a lot of us just have that in us, uh, where we don't want to necessarily agree
2668000	2671840	with everything. The person who's telling us what to do says, but this guy just lays it all out,
2671840	2677520	man, in such a brazen way. And I'm not excusing his insanity, like in what we're going through
2677520	2682880	right now, my wife and I have a running joke that we feel like we did jump timelines around 2016
2682880	2687440	because something feels off. Something feels time travel, time travel machine,
2688320	2693920	Berenstain Mandela effect, right? Yeah. Baron Trump. I mean, and then that's just a Berenstain
2693920	2700960	Trump shit. I don't know. I'm glad that you still feel it's like a joke though. You know,
2700960	2708320	that's gotta be comfortable. No, it's not a joke. The whole situation. Did you just,
2708320	2714480	yes. No, not at all. No, it really is. No, I'm continual and that's very bothered by this.
2714880	2721520	And I am, I'm bothered as well. Like I, I, I, I'm to the point where someone makes a Trump joke
2721520	2728560	and I think, yeah, but he's still fucking somehow up there. You know what I mean? And then it also
2728560	2734000	as a cheap skate, it bothers the shit out of me that every time I get a check from somewhere
2734000	2737840	that guy's getting some of the money. I don't know what he's going to do with it. He's an unhinged
2737840	2744320	lunatic. And, uh, and yeah, like I, it's not funny to me anymore. We are in the wrong timeline.
2744320	2749280	I feel like I, I'm so, I go up and down. I go to his sheer panic. Cause I feel like I'm always
2749280	2755200	in a good mood when he's in a bad mood. And then I'm like, why is it? What is that? I didn't have
2755200	2761840	that relationship with Obama. Why am I, why do I care? Like I'm so happy that the president's upset.
2761840	2765760	When is he not in a bad mood? Uh, well, he's, you know, he's not a jolly guy, but I like,
2765760	2772960	I like watching him. I like, I like waking up in the morning to a bunch of fake headlines in my feed
2773840	2780880	that even the fucking cynics and the, uh, uh, uh, what do you, what do you call them? Contrarian
2780880	2785840	is like, they can't even muster the point of view that you're underestimating him again. He's,
2785840	2790560	he's trolling you. Like, I like those weeks where it's just like, damn, this dude fucking up.
2790560	2794800	Like, like, and, and then he's not taking it well. And then like his tweets are like,
2794800	2799760	wins an egg, not an egg. I got a horseshoe. And everyone's like, what the fuck? He spelled
2799760	2807120	horseshoe wrong. And I liked those moments because it feels like a resolution as a writer.
2807120	2813840	I feel like the mad king is like on the pyre and like dousing himself, but I should know by now
2813840	2819440	that that doesn't happen. You know, it's like, like, like, like, like, so, so then I, and then
2819440	2825760	I go into this panic where I'm like, this whole thing is like beyond my control. That's the reason
2825760	2830800	why it's bad in the first place. So in these moments when he's sweating and the CIA is yelling
2830800	2834800	at the FBI and the FBI is yelling at the Supreme progress, like I should be in a higher state of
2834800	2839600	panic than when everything is running smoothly, but we're just torturing children at the border.
2840240	2844960	Yeah. That's the thing that sadly has occurred to us. I remember a while back,
2846400	2852000	Matt, you and Noel and I were hanging out and we were, we were talking about something. We had
2852000	2858720	lost some of the vim and vigor about this fucking guy, which is how we were phrased. And then, and
2858720	2865440	then we said, like, we had this moment where we, we went back at an arms remove and thought about
2865440	2870640	what future historians would think. And then it hit us, you know, just how going back to your
2870640	2876240	frog example, like there's that old cliche about slowly boiling. Yeah, I know. I know. It's lazy
2876240	2882560	writing, but it's real. And we also had this, we had this moment where we're like, it is stunning
2882560	2888400	and astonishing and terrifying how quickly things become normal. We're watching this guy
2888400	2894560	publicly and hilariously fall down a set of stairs and everybody's like, Oh, that's the
2894560	2899520	bottom stair. Yeah, that's the last. I'm just really pumped for the biopic when Gary Busey
2899520	2904000	plays him. I think that's going to be a lot of fun. I want to talk about something really
2904000	2909200	uncomfortable. You're hitting on something that really resonates with me, Dan, like that,
2910000	2913280	the reveling in somebody else's misery because you dislike them.
2914000	2921600	Oh, you're speaking up. But, but isn't it uncomfortable to think that this man leads
2921600	2931520	our country and we're happy that the leader of our country is doing the wrong thing? What's the
2931520	2936960	alternative? I was going to counter that. What I would say is I, the part of what upsets me about
2936960	2942400	the guy that makes me afraid of him when I'm in serious mode is that he represents this,
2942400	2948880	everything that he says, oh, he's joking about it. He's, uh, oh, or he's got the heart of America in
2948880	2953760	his hand, whatever. But everything that comes out of his mouth is about an end to free press is
2953760	2960480	about, is about, I, I am the only kind of patriot I could ever possibly be is the kind of patriot
2960480	2965200	that says, I have a right to hate America, et cetera, that whole flim flam. Like, like this idea
2965200	2969680	that the reason this country is great is because you don't have to love it for God's fucking sake.
2969680	2972800	What kind of codependent relationship was that? And everything out of his big,
2972800	2978560	blithery fucking syphilitic mouth is about how, if I had it my way, I wish it was like Korea,
2978560	2981680	I just go back from Korea. It's great over there. You can, they can turn you into soup
2981680	2985680	if you don't like things. And I'm just like, I don't care that you're joking or that you're
2985680	2990720	stupid. That's fucking dangerous because it doesn't take intelligence to overthrow what we have,
2990720	2996800	which is Jesus Christ. It's a fucking luxury that we, like a whole engine is driven by
2996800	3003120	a patriotic derision, a cynicism. Like we constantly going, I don't like the way this
3003120	3009440	country is being run right now. So I, I, on one hand, I, you're, what you're saying is
3010400	3015280	shouldn't it, shouldn't it, shouldn't it drive us all into the streets in our underwear that we,
3015280	3021840	we can derive pleasure from the president's misery for me in those moments, I think because
3021840	3028240	I'm so deprived of them in an extreme way in, in all of his other days, to me, I'm just like,
3028240	3034800	it feels like a brief suspension of a migraine. It's, and that registers as pleasure. If you
3034800	3038880	suffer from chronic migraines, it's like, oh, there's not a nail being driven into my temple
3038880	3046080	right now. Trump, like any fucking person who occupies that office is sweating bullets.
3046080	3050560	That's what you should be doing because part of your job is you're allowed to invade countries
3050560	3054320	at your whim. You're allowed to like launch missiles. You're allowed to do whatever the
3054320	3061280	fuck you want. But I mean, like if it doesn't just devolve into total like totalitarianism,
3061280	3065600	Mad Max kind of situation, at least it showed us the holes in the system in a way
3065600	3069040	we haven't quite seen in this has been refreshing, but I do also worry about it.
3069040	3075440	Cause it's like what we've been seeing in this cow stomach window for those who have state
3075440	3080160	fairs and then from their hometowns, the four H fans. What we've been, what we've been gazing
3080160	3086160	into is that there's this constant fear of like, God damn it. This guy was six IQ points from
3086160	3091760	successfully being Hitler. Like, like he was always, every time he fucks up, every time he
3091760	3097440	gets on a phone call, it's being recorded or transcribed. Every time he, every time he decides
3097440	3102160	that, I mean, what if the next guy, it doesn't matter what his political leanings are.
3102160	3106000	Our definition of insanity has been forever changed.
3106000	3113040	And the envelope is too loose now. They're the checks and balances have been eroded.
3113040	3120880	But a gig becomes president and wears a burgundy jumper that with a logo on it,
3120880	3125840	that is the earth with a, with a heart above it that represents like no more fucking bullshit,
3125840	3130800	no more hatred. And we're like, yay. And then he tweets every once in a while,
3130800	3136800	Hey, Betty Crocker got her spoon in my ass and he misspells ass. We're going to be like, well,
3137520	3142560	try to misspelled his own name. Well, that's Pete. Yeah. That's like, we're gonna, we're,
3142560	3148240	it's like, we shouldn't, we shouldn't tolerate that much insanity. It scares me that forever now
3148240	3155920	the office of the president is just like, it used to be steeped in starch that I think kept me safe.
3155920	3160000	But is there a course correction? Well, that's, I don't think so. That's the thing that I love
3160080	3165520	that you said forever. That's a, that's a fascinating word in this conversation because
3165520	3172640	what we keep forgetting, I think in, in national discourse and any conversation about this is that
3172640	3177440	this is a, you know, you'll see that shit around July 4th when people are like,
3177440	3181840	what a bold experiment by the American experiment. It's great, but it's true.
3181840	3190320	200 years is not a long time at all. Really, right now, if this, if this shit collapses,
3190320	3195600	right? And we're all just running around, having that conversation about when we have to eat a dead
3195600	3202080	body, then what, what's going to happen is that in the future, people will say a bunch of folks got
3202080	3209360	together in this one part of the world. And for a little like for around 200 years worked. Okay.
3209840	3215920	Yeah. But everybody saw the signs, right? But the unspoken part of that is that, whoa. And the
3215920	3222400	people before them had, they had it right because that lasted 1500 years where, uh, whoever was the
3222400	3228400	son of whoever was, had the crown on last. It's like time moves more slowly underneath those
3228400	3233440	crowns because those people were even dumber. And we sped up time because we fucking rule.
3233840	3239840	And we, we, we, we took capitalism and democracy to an extreme. We did the most bad and we're on
3239840	3245520	the most on record and we opened our books and we add fucking things to the constitution. It's like,
3245520	3253040	it's our, we're the best of a bad lot as one of our guests once said, I would disagree on two points.
3253040	3259360	First off, I would disagree on two points. Um, and the, the first point is that while this
3259360	3266320	purports to be a meritocracy, uh, anyone here would have a very difficult time explaining to
3266320	3271440	someone from another place, like, yeah, we elect people cause they're the best. They just happen
3271440	3275440	to be fucking related to each other. What a coincidence, right? That's like winning the
3275440	3283040	lottery 12 times that that, that kind of hierarchy, that kind of, uh, a risk aristocratic approach to
3283040	3289440	things happens. And you know, like, uh, like, okay, if the president is the, um, the best
3289440	3298320	compromise, right? The way the system was designed, then why are so many related? I always hated that.
3298320	3305520	And that's the thing that's like fucking just winded me is that I, everything that got this guy
3305520	3310080	elected or things that I felt like, like in an objective sense, in terms of a view of the
3310080	3314960	bipartisan system, I was like, people would say, I'm afraid Trump's going to win. And I would say,
3314960	3320240	Trump's not going to win because there's no difference between Democrats and Republicans
3320240	3324160	and the whole system's rigged in there. It doesn't even matter if you vote. And everything
3324160	3330480	that I said when I went into that glockenspiel routine is how and why he got elected. And it's
3330480	3335280	also like, he could be standing here and he'd be like, doing the same thing and saying the same
3335280	3339120	thing that I was saying. And it like, it is a bummer cause I was like, it's like, why so many
3339120	3343920	Clintons? Why so many bushes? Why do we have dynasties? If this, if this job has anything to
3343920	3349840	do with anything. And now here, here he is the first guy to break a streak. And, uh, well, not the
3349840	3354240	first guy there was just black guy for eight years, by the way, because he has to broken a streak
3354240	3360240	because it's Harvard. It's, it's that it's basically that these clans set up a hierarchy
3360240	3365120	and then they dominate for, for more than 200 years. True. I'm getting into another year.
3365600	3371360	The other issue is that this is the conspiracy is that the presidency is what's causing this.
3371920	3378400	It's not one individual or one, one government or branch of government. It's a group of individuals
3378400	3385360	that are half elected, half not elected. You know, we're, we are where we are because we allowed some
3385360	3391760	of our power to be given up into politics instead of just basic daily maintenance. So there's the,
3391760	3399440	the larger lie is that it's Trump. Because the truth of the matter is it's us. We saw it.
3400080	3402960	We were told it was coming and we did not believe it.
3404000	3407840	Wow. This is Harmon town. You guys, this is like, I love this.
3410720	3412560	All right. Moving on to our next segment.
3412560	3421280	I didn't want to get bogged down to this guy, but I just think it's so amazing that part of
3421280	3425680	his culture is literally is all the conspiracy stuff. And it's so funny that he's taken all the
3425680	3430960	joy out of it too. Oh yeah. Yeah. So like sucked all the meaning out of this. Like words, you know,
3430960	3438480	I remember I was into Alex Jones. Like I didn't know Alex Jones for his politics was the guy who
3438480	3442560	thought everyone was a lizard. I thought he was the guy in waking life. And then I was like,
3442560	3448240	that guy has a show. And he was the guy that broke into the bohemian grove.
3448240	3453200	That part was true. They do that. That's creepy. They do do that. Have you ever been there, Dan?
3453200	3457920	Go say what? Have you ever been to the, I don't think I'm, I may be a one percenter, but I think
3457920	3465840	part one of the greatest tricks, the 1% plays on you guys is, uh, it's like stock. Uh,
3466320	3470800	the 1% is there's a hundred percent of a one, the 1% and there's a 1% of them.
3471360	3478160	Like I, I just have a pool. Oh yeah. But it's a nice pool. Yeah. It's amazing to me when I look
3478160	3483120	on Google, I go like, wait, where, what is the 1% of the stuff that I look, depending on how you
3483120	3487760	define it, it's kind of like trying to define generation acts and, uh, generation, uh, the
3487760	3494160	millennial or whatever. But I, unless my, unless I'm Googling wrong or something, I'm like, what?
3494240	3499680	I'm a one percenter, but then I'm like, oh yeah, I get, well, yeah. Who the fuck else like lives
3499680	3504880	like this? Okay. What really? One percent. I think maybe I'm like, what? And then I go,
3504880	3509680	yeah, I think I'm a one percenter. That's how fucked up it is out there. That, uh, that there's
3509680	3515920	like 21 percenters, but the rest, the other 200 million of us are 99 percenters. I hate to be
3515920	3521920	really Pollyanna, but they truly believe that my life is not that like, like, I feel like everyone
3521920	3527920	should live like I live. I know that sounds so fucking like not even sad. And I also do feel this
3527920	3532640	is, I guess why I, you know, I tend to, I lean in the, you know, the more liberal direction is
3532640	3541120	because I do, I do feel like I'm like, yeah, I'm, I'm clearly not holding like, like I, I got a lot
3541120	3547680	of luck going on here and I'm only falling back on the fact that I'm not forced to share, but like,
3547680	3553040	I do feel like, like I look at my house and I go, if I had to give up like 12 square feet,
3553040	3559520	you know, that in the, like I look at it like a video game, I go like, I'm pretty sure everyone
3559520	3568880	could have a modest hacienda. A modest hacienda. With a pool. Yeah. Dan Harmon. I really do feel,
3568880	3574880	I mean, I don't, I like, like, like when we have these giant urban centers, like we stack people
3574880	3582320	up in these tenements, but are we like those, as we know, they can have neighbors who are living
3582320	3587360	very comfortably. So we know that there's nothing necessarily about stacking people up in a giant
3587360	3593280	urban center that necessarily means you have to live in squalor. We just use that as an excuse.
3593280	3599440	And then like, I just feel like people could live, everyone could live pretty comfortably. I mean,
3599520	3605360	the math is there. That is correct. Logistically, if you look at it, logistically, everybody,
3606000	3614320	all the billions could have something like an, uh, an equitable, I don't want to say worry free
3614320	3619680	because there's no worry free life, but could have some kind of situation where we are not,
3621280	3627120	I want to be careful, but we're not, we're not having people who are starving. We're not having
3627200	3631760	people who are dying of preventable disease. Well, there's a conspiracy theory that I'm sure
3631760	3637920	you guys have explored in various parts of various episodes. That's a classic conspiracy theory
3637920	3646400	that is absolutely true, which is that the, the, the more rich people you get getting like access
3646400	3652640	to technology and a, and a, and free time and a larger view of things, the more they are going to
3652640	3660400	tend to use their power, influence and wealth to create a situation where they're not going to do
3660400	3665760	what you do with weed. They're not going to go, holy shit, I'm really high. How can I get more of
3665760	3670000	this and share it with more people? They're going to do what you do with cocaine, which is like,
3670000	3675440	holy shit, this is really good. Who saw me go in the bathroom? Um, there, there you're, you're,
3675440	3681840	you're going to be like, I gotta get this shit on lockdown or like, like there's just an instinct
3681840	3688960	about it. And it's all like, it, you don't even need guys in a cigar smoke room. It's money itself
3688960	3696080	will create that system. It will, if you don't, and here's where I say dirty words that I don't
3696080	3705280	want to be associated with, if you don't regulate, um, it unmitigated, unregulated, rampant fucking
3705280	3715040	high noon capitalism is going to go and tear the middle class in half and not, not in half,
3715040	3720640	it's going to tear the top 1% of the middle class and shove it up. And it's going to tear the bottom
3720640	3727760	99% of the middle class and shove it down. It's going to, capitalism unregulated doesn't become
3727760	3736880	this perfect pyramid of money. It becomes, uh, well, it becomes feudal. It becomes, it becomes
3736880	3744400	monarchs, uh, overseeing potato people. Like the Coke industry, uh, is actively working toward
3744400	3751200	what I would argue is neo-feudalism. Also, you know, I find it very optimistic that we're speaking
3751280	3760160	in the conditional at this point, you know, like this, this, this idea, uh, it's what an ADU is.
3761120	3766640	Yes. An ADU is you can build a poor person's shack on your huge fucking piece of land and charge
3766640	3771440	them for it. Just like we did during the feudal shit where you might have two, three people who
3771440	3775760	are paying you rent to live on your manner. So you don't have to sell your manner. It is,
3775760	3780640	it isn't conditional. It's where we are. And should they not be able to afford that rent?
3780640	3789520	Maybe there's things they could do to keep the land of direct deposit for their paycheck. Like,
3789520	3793120	Hey, thank you. You trimmed a Bush. Now you can live here for another month. What if there were
3793120	3799520	a specific form of currency that only applied right to that manner, right? To that land. Uh,
3799520	3809760	and this, this is something that we write with your face on it. So this is something that we
3809760	3816080	talked about that we had a difficult time cracking. The three of us, uh, Matt, Nolan, I were thinking
3816080	3822240	we, we posed this question. Um, we're, we're kind of, we're kind of shitty to each other in
3822240	3826720	conversation. I don't know if you picked that up because, because we're like, we post questions
3826720	3831120	that we don't have answers to. Right. And one of the questions to do with us, that's just the nature
3831120	3836240	of this kind of discourse. That is shitty though. Well, you're right. Do you mean on this show or
3836240	3840160	on your podcast or what are you, what are you saying? More in our personal alone. Yeah. Like,
3840160	3844800	when we're at Dave and busters or something, I think it's inspiring how kind you guys are to
3844800	3848960	each other on the podcast. Like, like, I don't know how much you edit. If like you guys are dicks to
3848960	3853040	each other, then you edit out. Yeah. But I think it's right. You guys take great pains or maybe
3853040	3857280	you don't take great pains. Maybe that's me projecting almost hurt, um, to be nice, but you
3857280	3862160	guys like, like one of you will say something and then like, like, like you guys have like an almost
3862160	3866960	tick of going, like, even if it's absolutely not what you were talking about, you'll, you'll,
3866960	3871040	you'll go like that. You know what? That's a good way of putting it. And then you'll continue.
3871680	3876400	Well, we mean it, uh, or at least, oh shit. Am I the only one who means it when I say that?
3876400	3880000	No, I did. No, we all mean it. It's all good. You guys are really nice to each other.
3880720	3883920	What a, what a really cool thing to do.
3883920	3896640	Whoa. It sounds like, whoa, whoa, shots, fucking fire. You enjoy that behavior and you understand
3896640	3906080	that it's good and right to do to people that you work with or been friends with since you were 19.
3906080	3913120	You know, like it, it seems, I think that's a, that's really cool too.
3914320	3919360	Well, it, it took us a while to get there. Yeah, you guys have known each other for how long?
3919920	3925920	A couple of weeks. Yeah, a couple of weeks. Yeah, it's gonna, it takes a while. It takes a while.
3926720	3934800	It takes a while. You did a good job on the draft. It was a good thing you did. Hey, congrats on the
3934800	3939840	show by the way. Yeah, congratulations. Thank you. Good job on your creep show. God damn.
3940720	3946720	The deal for me. Yeah. And Rob and Rob's the only person on this stage who has a premiering show.
3947600	3954000	It's going to say congrats on the trailer too. Oh yeah. What are we congratulating each other?
3954000	3958960	Yeah. Congrats on the Rick and Morty season four trailer. Yeah. Oh yes. Oh yeah. I did that.
3959920	3966000	And Harmon quest is coming in. Yeah. Harmon quest. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, it's great. Yeah. Watch
3966000	3975280	Harmon quest only on verb. What is that an app? Is that an app? You did it. How do you spell it?
3980800	3988000	That's nice. That's nice. Hey, hey you guys, uh, seriously, do you think there's anything
3988000	3993840	to magic? I don't, I don't mean illusion. Do you mean the gathering? No, no. I mean,
3993840	4000800	I mean like spell casting from the dark ages, like this kind of made its way all the way to
4000800	4006800	2019. Do you think there's anything to any of like ritual ritualized versions of that? Literally
4006800	4012160	anything to it? Yeah. Yes. Because whether, even if it's just the intention of wanting something
4012160	4017280	so badly and then ritualizing the, uh, the act of saying that this is what I want, even if it's
4017360	4022480	silly, even if it's silly. Okay. Well, I mean, no, yeah, I'm sorry. I believe in it on a subjective
4022480	4028880	level. Like I think that there's, uh, there's almost no, uh, limit on what you can accomplish
4028880	4034800	ritualistically with yourself. Like, like it's, you know, and that's the boring answer. It's like
4034800	4041440	the miracle in 24th street. Well, he thinks he's Santa. Um, but I think you could, I think you
4041440	4046320	can't, you can convince yourself, anyone that's in the room with you, when you cast a spell,
4046960	4053120	I, I don't think there's any limit on what you can like make those people do. So you, so you're
4053120	4058320	talking in terms of practical effect, right? If, yeah, I'm saying like, like the human capacity
4058320	4064640	to believe in, well, I would use the word bullshit, but like that makes that's pejorative, but like,
4064640	4070880	like to, to believe in shit that has no corporeal, like, like, like cause effect relationship. Like
4070880	4075680	you, you could draw a circle of chalk on the ground and say the reason I'm drawing the circle
4075680	4080880	of chalk on the ground is because you're a winner and you're a loser. And I'm going to flip that
4080880	4086400	right now by saying Chaka Chaka, Mooka Mooka. Oh no, I said it backwards. Oh no. Freaky Friday.
4086400	4091280	Like, like, like, like I, I mean, though I believe that we've seen, we see all the time,
4091280	4096960	like people will drop down on the floor, speak in tongues though. Uh, people regress in their
4096960	4101040	hypnotic sessions. It really, it's almost a moot point, whether or not it's real or not.
4101040	4107440	Could a Hulk exist? Could, could a Hulk exist? That'd be incredible. Yeah. Like an incredible
4107440	4117920	Hulk. Totally. Maybe not a fair to mid lead. You know, I'm glad you say that because I, uh,
4117920	4122800	I think, you know, uh, I was again, I, best definition, I heard of magic by the way,
4122800	4127200	Matt, I think we talked about this weaponized psychology, which I think is in line with what
4127200	4132720	you were saying. Um, hold back to back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yeah, of course. Um,
4132720	4137520	thank you for considering me. You picked up on how interrupted I was. And okay. Yeah.
4138320	4144080	I want you to feel safe. Grease that wheel. I'm just going to sit here. No, you'll be rewarded.
4144080	4149040	Grease them, grease them up. So you're going to fly through the grocery store. It was pay
4149040	4154080	attention to him. See at the finish line. Well, this is something I want everybody's opinion on
4154080	4158720	because like, so, so there's this, there's this thing with, um, with the Olympics, right?
4158720	4163760	The Olympics are always like, ah, there's the peak of human ability, right? And, uh, drugs,
4163760	4167360	everyone's on drugs now. Everyone's on drugs. Well, they're on like, it's not a lot of green
4167360	4172080	people. It's so loophole-y. Okay. So you're married to the color idea of it. Uh, it wouldn't be
4173440	4177760	like that's a Hulk. He didn't say it. And are you pulling a time machine thing? He was originally
4177760	4185280	great. Thank you. Yeah. And red for a time. Oh, what? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. And then also
4185280	4191520	thunderbolt, uh, whatever. There's different, we could go on, but, uh, but the idea is like,
4191520	4198000	why so baseball, when baseball first started, it was considered cheating to use a black people
4198000	4205280	to catch the ball. Oh, I mean, I, I thought, I thought we were getting real episodes left.
4208160	4214640	And then I'll be meeting meetings about it and going, okay, if this guy plays baseball,
4214640	4218640	right? Right. I think they're saying the idea of like it being like an unfair advantage or like
4218640	4221920	corking your bat or something like that, or like greasing, you know, like spinning on the
4221920	4225760	ball or whatever. That was a thing. And now it's like, you know, without the racism, which was
4225760	4231760	fucking terrible and huge, uh, there, there's still this idea that like Lance Armstrong,
4231760	4239840	an amazing cyclist got in trouble, right? Uh, boo hoo. He used drugs. He got some blood. Yeah.
4239840	4245520	And so, so I want to see, I think our best chance to see a fair to middling Hulk as you describe
4245520	4252240	it is to have an Olympic event of some sort. People sign a release like, yeah, I might die,
4252240	4256640	whatever. And they can do what the, whatever the fuck they want. You know what I mean? Oh,
4256640	4261840	yeah. What caliber engineered Olympics? Holy shit. Yeah. You should have a separate fucking
4261840	4269760	police for it. Delete this podcast. We've got to go to the government or something. Holy shit.
4270720	4276560	Different thing. But I'm thinking like the, the idea, like the, the idea of people doping,
4276560	4283200	it's a lost battle. It's going to happen. The, the, uh, lid of Pandora's jar is unscrewed and
4283200	4287680	everybody's lying to themselves. Yeah. If they think they can screw it back, the reporter's
4287680	4294160	covering it. How many cups of coffee? It was a jar. It was a jar. It was always a jar. It sounds
4294160	4300480	dumb. Just sounds dumb. It sounds dumb, but it was a jar. What caliber of Hulk was, was Hogan.
4300480	4310640	Was he a middling Hulk or was he legit? Did you guys see the video by any chance of the, uh,
4310640	4319280	uh, I think quadriplegic is the word that he's paralyzed from below his neck and, uh,
4319280	4326800	he's operating a full, uh, body exoskeleton. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool.
4326800	4331120	That's awesome. I tell that guy that the Olympics should eliminate drugs.
4332080	4336400	Whoa. You know what I mean? That's, that's a good point. And he's like, Oh yeah. Cause like, well,
4336880	4344640	you eliminate drugs. There should be max in the genetic engineered Olympics. That sounds great.
4344640	4349120	Yeah. There should, there should be one category that I think would quickly lose
4349120	4356000	its luster if it, because it was javelin. No, I'm saying the league, I'm saying like,
4356000	4360320	everyone could have their purest Olympics and there wouldn't even, it would, the problem would
4360320	4364000	solve itself. People wouldn't be incentivized to cheat in those. They wouldn't like go into the
4364000	4370320	purest Olympics and like sneak steroids. They'd be like, I want to go into the steroids Olympics
4370320	4376000	and, and then just have this like crazy fucking like weird, like just dark future thing where
4376000	4381600	it's like, and coming to the corner, using the latest in cybernetic augmentation, Andre,
4381600	4386640	on drop off the blood dope robot from Mars. And it's the guys just like,
4386640	4396000	30% humans, according to some experts, he is mostly pickup truck, but all Russian.
4397920	4404240	I just have a race around a circle. Everyone's going to watch that. You'd want, I'd watch it.
4404240	4408720	Yeah. Like I'm not going to watch it. People in Vegas would go crazy. I'm going to watch the
4408720	4414320	swimming competition. They were the guy that was born with long feet wins the organic Olympics.
4414800	4419440	Oh, you did it again with your weird long feet.
4420480	4425280	It's all about the human interest story there. So this is a perfect transition to like Boston
4425280	4430320	dynamics and DARPA and some of the robots and androids that are being created. Some of them
4430320	4435680	are very humanoid. Like, uh, what do you guys think about all of that stuff? Oh, that's real.
4435680	4439840	Yeah. Yeah. Completely real. But what do you, where do you think we're headed with all of that?
4439840	4444800	Is it just, we're headed toward yikes. Yeah. Shit. We're all definitely,
4445760	4450000	the question is in our lifetime, you guys look younger than me. You have most of your hair. I,
4450000	4458160	I, am I going to see like an actual like fucking like just like wake up one morning and it's like,
4458160	4465440	everything's just like just converted to AI algorithm thing. Uh, or will I just be like
4465440	4470640	a 70 year old guy going like, I don't like these new fangled USB ports on your forehead.
4472960	4476720	I need that like a hole in my head. Write that down Cody.
4477680	4487040	And Cody will be like, I'm 40. Uh, yeah, I don't, uh, you know, it's, uh, it's, it's, uh,
4487040	4492400	more and more. I went back and I rewatched, uh, the Terminator franchise will parts of it.
4492400	4497360	And I was like, yeah, the, uh, the robots, when they started out, people would talk about it in
4497360	4501680	hindsight. And they were like, we could tell the difference between those. Right. And it's a fit.
4501680	4506880	It's a story about a physical analog, but now we're at the point where in terms of software,
4506880	4512720	in terms of like online non corporeal conversation, it can be difficult to tell to discern the
4512720	4518560	difference. And it's also becoming increasingly apparent that our biggest sins are original ones.
4518560	4525120	Like we, we have rounded a corner. Uh, uh, our friend Asperger detective, uh, that's our
4525120	4530640	horrible word for him. Uh, his name is Ryan Krause, the host of, uh, uh, cold case murder mystery,
4530640	4538720	uh, files. Uh, he, he constantly, he's talking about just like, look, talk about the shit all
4538720	4542480	you want. We're all going to become AI. And then our problems are going to be solved and all,
4542480	4545920	and he talks about the Terminator franchise and our relationship with it
4546720	4554800	as a sort of measuring that that the, you've got your 1981, 83 movie, um, where the, you know,
4554800	4560560	the robot is unquestionably the bad guy. The whole premise is set up. It's based on our fetishization
4560560	4567760	of fearing technology. It's classic, beautiful, wonderful, modern, uh, myth. That's just like
4569120	4572800	before the words algorithm and AI were household words. It was just sort of like,
4573440	4577600	they put, they put this thing in charge of defending the country. And then this thing
4577600	4582640	decided that the best way to defend it was to get rid of all the people. Beautiful. Perfect.
4582640	4588640	It set this thing back in time. If you blow its fake skin off, what's underneath death,
4588640	4594560	but Chrome, it comes for you. The sequel comes years later and immediately. What are we doing?
4594560	4599680	And why did we love that movie? Our, our, our, our love affair with our villains. We love our Jason
4599680	4604560	Voorhees, our Freddy Krueger. Like we don't love the screen Queens that run from them. Um, we love
4604560	4609200	this metal robot. And then he's the good guy in the next movie. We love the guy that said,
4609200	4614560	I'll be back. We love the guy that is the robot, the robot in that movie that peop,
4614560	4619280	a lot of people say that movie is why I know about the first movie. I fucking love that
4619280	4628240	new Testament where now the robots, the good guy, the, as that franchise continues and as our sci-fi
4628320	4634560	kind of relationship continues, like we're, we're getting increasingly more like, um,
4634560	4641280	we're doing a mating dance with technology. We are, we, we used to simply, Rod Serling would simply
4641280	4647360	come out and basically say, um, imagine a world where we get so automated, we basically become
4647360	4654000	Russian and a garage door that opens when your car pulls up, but where are the limits? And if that
4654000	4659760	garage door knew you murdered someone, should it? Um, and, and, and it was like technology. It was
4659760	4664800	like, like, like, wait, where will it end? And you proceed forward along those lines. We're like,
4664800	4669040	cautious, we're cautious, we're cautious, but that's how a tango begins. That's how a mating
4669040	4675360	dance. He got movies like her, like X Machina, which literally about like a relationship with
4675360	4680800	an AI that's better than a relationship with someone that, you know, he has to, he has to
4680800	4685280	accept that because, yeah, I mean, exactly. That's why that we're, we're getting increasingly
4685280	4692400	comfortable with those stories. We're, we're, we're becoming aware that, uh, not that we're
4692400	4698720	shaking, uh, it's ironic because we're shaking our xenophobia when it comes to the difference
4698720	4704080	between human and nonhuman, we're getting increasingly racist. We're getting increasingly
4704080	4707680	like heightened about like your cheekbones are different. What's with your identity politics?
4707680	4712720	Just because a woman did this doesn't mean, like, it's like we're regressing in our flesh,
4712720	4719600	but we're worshiping the idea of we got it. And it's almost like you wonder what a crayfish or
4719600	4725840	a dragonfly or anything it sheds its skin feels about itself as it starts to evolve. Does it start
4725840	4732080	to just pick at itself? Is it like, oh, well, it does that, is that a metaphor for like what we're
4732080	4736720	doing? It was like this war between the genders and the races and the cultures and the classes,
4736720	4743280	and we're just like shredding ourselves. Is it because what's underneath is we gotta like,
4743280	4749280	we gotta just become an algorithm or we're going to die where we, it's like, like we're,
4749280	4754720	it's, it's not going to work. This plan where there's just like an eight billion barrel of
4754720	4759840	monkeys like sitting on top of a planet that needs to give up its oil or fucking die. Well,
4759840	4767280	I think where we, we, we have messed up often is this assumption that what's going on now is the
4767280	4773920	end point. You know what I mean? Like some species of life sort of exist in this, in this state where
4773920	4778160	they have, you know, they have like the origin point, right? And then they create the other,
4778160	4783280	the other animal that is or life form that's midway point. And the thing at the end, just
4783280	4788880	to your, your idea about shedding skin or I would say entering a chrysalis as well, it is something
4788880	4797280	different, fundamentally alien, unrecognizable. It's it's preposterously self-centered for us
4797280	4806480	here now to assume that in a thousand or maybe even 600 years, the, the people that call themselves
4806480	4813040	people are also going to refer to us as people. Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous. I, I feel like it's
4813040	4819600	optimistic. They're gonna, we're going to be not their species. That is like a fundamental,
4819600	4823120	like, like cup of coffee, like, like you're thinking about it. Like there is absolute,
4823840	4828880	should we survive 600 years from now, there's absolutely no way that what we are 600 years
4828880	4834000	from now is going to refer to us as the same species. That's, that is, well, there's one,
4834640	4840240	one scenario in which they will, it's the Cormac McCarthy, the road. Yeah. Oh yeah. Like they'll,
4840240	4845520	they'll, they'll go like, oh, the progenitors, the people that had computers. Fall out shit,
4845520	4850400	you know, they'll be in like bunkers. They won't go outside. We don't care about their opinion. Yeah.
4850400	4858640	Assuming we continue to evolve, we along even the slowest lines, 600 years, which anthropologically
4858640	4867360	is a, is nothing. We are, we are at the point where we are either going to change so much
4867360	4875600	that what we are now it will be forgotten, historical, Neanderthalic. Like we will,
4875600	4879680	we will simply, there will be people that will study how we thought. There will be people who
4879680	4884480	will, I hope they'll listen to this podcast and they'll go, what's it, weren't they cute?
4885680	4892320	Like they, their skulls were separated and they just kept blithering and blabbering and like they
4892320	4896800	self-medicated and they coped with all this shit. They had a whole internet and they just
4896800	4901520	used it to be racist. They had these things called hands and they had to use their hands.
4901520	4905040	Everything was fingers and typing and they're just like, they, they kept talking about holograms.
4905040	4909920	Like that was the future. They didn't understand that like intelligence was a field and that they
4909920	4918320	were a proxy. Um, and that what we became was it or I or they or zem. Um, and yeah, we will,
4918320	4922720	yeah, that's for sure. That kind of takes the pressure off, doesn't it? Totally. Like who
4922800	4928960	cares? Nukes, uh, like fucking Bay of pigs. Who cares how we go out? Is there a, is there a way
4928960	4935200	to spot a conspiracy that has legs versus a way that like classic lying conspiracies follow this
4935200	4943760	pattern? Absolutely. Yeah. You can, you can just see it. Like there's a trick to see it. Uh,
4943760	4948080	like do you check for like three or four things where you're like, all right, that's, yeah, like
4948080	4953360	that's worth researching. Like it's how, well, I would just say generally, and sorry, Ben to step
4953360	4960720	on you here. Um, if we can go back and say historically, there are, there's more than one
4960720	4966160	version of this kind of conspiracy that has occurred. That's generally the first step to
4966160	4970880	going, okay, well there's at least a precedent to something like this happening, which means it's
4970880	4977840	not completely implausible. Um, and generally that's syphilis. Sure. Like syphilis, just like that.
4978240	4984160	But like syphilis testing has happened. Oh, for sure. Like the Tuskegee. Yes. Oh my God. Yeah.
4984160	4991520	Human, human testing. Uh, that's not a theory. That shit happens a lot. And over the years,
4991520	4997520	it has an age. It's really hard to even detect. Oh God, I'll go down a rabbit hole. Let's not do
4997520	5004400	that. Uh, do it. Okay. You got it. Experimenting with humans. I mean, some of the most brilliant
5004400	5009840	people on this planet have been really fucked up and wanted to see what things happen. Like
5009840	5015920	if you think about anatomy, Ben Franklin had a tool shed. Uh, oh no, you pointed at me like,
5015920	5029280	I was, I was making a joke. No, he had a, he had a, he had a tool shed. I think he dissected
5029280	5033680	corpses or something, right? No, they found somebody for sure. They found a bunch of bodies.
5033920	5040320	What? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Ben Franklin was, he had a tool shed. It was a, what they call a resurrection
5040320	5045440	man, right? Yeah. Well, he was resurrection adjacent, resurrection man adjacent. He, uh,
5045440	5052720	his landlords, uh, is one of his landlord's children was a resurrection man. The, the, uh,
5052720	5058720	house he was living in at the time, uh, was like the next place over was where they publicly
5058720	5066240	hanged people. So they would hang someone. And then, uh, long story short, he may not have been
5066240	5071280	dissecting people, but he fucking knew the smell. Think about the smell. He knew there was no way.
5072480	5077680	Live next door to a place where they hang people and he liked it. And he was like, like hauling
5077680	5083200	people into his tool shed. What's a resurrection man? It's like, uh, when you dig up bodies and
5083200	5088800	use it to for, for experiments, because think about it, you had to, we didn't know much about
5088800	5092960	what was inside of these things that we walk around in. And the only way to figure it out was
5092960	5099600	to cut them open after they were dead and just pull all the bits out and CEO women had fewer teeth.
5099600	5104720	Yeah. Yeah. Which is weird. Cause he was around so many mouths. He could have just looked. And
5104720	5108880	you would think it wasn't the life expectancy 17 back then you think there would be a bunch of dead
5108880	5113840	women. You could just like same number of teeth, but I don't think it's just that you just didn't
5113840	5117520	want to talk to people. I guess he was born to the theory side of it. I don't know. It just probably
5117520	5121600	felt right. And he probably died at 19. Like he just was right. One of these days I should count
5121600	5125920	women's teeth. I'll get to it. I'll get to it. In the meantime, give me a lever and a place to
5125920	5130240	stand and I'll move the world. Um, that's Archimedes. That's Archimedes, but he was probably
5130240	5135280	always in there. Sorry. I derailed you. Please continue. I'm not going anywhere anymore. Human
5135360	5142000	experimentation, resurrection, resurrection, man. There was a loophole in European law at the time,
5142000	5149120	which said that it was okay to dissect dead bodies, human bodies, cadavers. Uh, but it was,
5149120	5155760	there was no legal way to procure them. It was like a grizzly version of, uh, how marijuana
5155760	5161360	has worked in some parts of this country. Like you can own it, but if we catch you buying it,
5161360	5165840	if it gets you digging it up, yeah, if we catch you digging it up, uh, and then, uh, that goes
5165840	5171120	back. I think what you're building toward is this idea of human experimentation. Yeah. Okay. This is,
5171120	5175280	this is the point I want to make talking about this and it's, it's only tangential, but we've
5175280	5179600	had a couple of thought experiments on our show before, when you think about world war two and
5179600	5185520	unit 731 in Japan and, uh, both the Nazis were doing in several places, they were experimenting
5185520	5192800	on humans and they were taking humans to, to, to see the limits of what a person can withstand.
5192800	5197200	Right. And they wrote all of this shit down after they tortured people this way
5197200	5201920	and they took a ton of data and we've had a discussions about, well, what do you do
5201920	5206160	at the end of that conflict where you stop those evil people from doing terrible things to other
5206160	5211200	humans, but they've got all of these pieces of paper written down. So filing cabinets full of
5211200	5218880	data, data that could possibly be useful for, for us to know about what humanity can withstand.
5218880	5223920	Just ergonomic desk chair industry stuff. Like, like, wow, wow. I didn't know you could make
5223920	5229040	someone's slouch for 90 hours. Herman Miller was really into all this, uh, it's not too
5229040	5233840	dangerous. Because you can't repeat the experiments. Yes. In a perfect world one would not.
5233840	5239360	Should you talk it out? Do you discard to the, to the data? Well, and that's what we've been doing.
5239360	5244000	It's the, the palimpsest thing that Ben, you're really great about talking about with history.
5244000	5248720	We've been doing that to each other, that kind of thing where we're, we do terrible things to
5248720	5252880	each other, but we figure out something. And then we know for the future that that is something we
5252880	5257520	can or cannot do. There's always someone saying, I'm not the bad guy. It's the greater good
5258240	5264800	serious. You know, uh, think about the origins of gynecology, which are barbaric. The vagina.
5265600	5271920	The, uh, the, the, just so, just so. I mean, yeah, it's definitely, you're in that origin,
5271920	5278800	but you're in the ballpark. Yeah. Uh, it was the doctor who performed on slaves. Yeah, exactly.
5278800	5282800	Recently ripped his, uh, statue down in New York. Thank God. Finally. Thank you.
5284880	5286880	Uh, I honestly don't know where you were going with this whole thing,
5286880	5290880	but we were talking about conspiracies and how to rat as well as we have legs trying to figure out
5290880	5295040	if there's, yeah, if there's a, if there's like, oh, we have four things, we're definitely on the
5295040	5300000	right path. Or if you're like, you know, it's missing these four things. It's probably just
5300000	5304400	the ones with the ones with ghosts are usually bullshit. I'll put that on out there. It's like
5304400	5310640	a guarantee. Well, there's ghost conspiracies. Oh yeah. Dones. All right. Namely by ghost for
5310640	5317600	ghost episodes a week, dude. We gotta, we gotta dig. I mean, I was just talking to, um, uh, Kate,
5317600	5323840	the star of that shuttered show that Rob does, um, you know, she's a producer and stuff. And she
5323840	5330720	said that two different psychics told her she had, uh, an Italian speaking evil spirit. And then she
5330720	5336720	also had in the same spot, she was diagnosed to spirit. She had an aura photographer take a photo
5336720	5344080	of her aura and had a spot right in that same spot. But that's crazy. Not like a, she didn't have a
5344080	5349520	proper or I understand. She just had this, you know, spirit spot above her head. I'm also like,
5349520	5354560	I'm being a cynic, but like I, I'm not saying that spiritual stuff and ghosts aren't real, but, uh,
5354560	5361360	it's that, that I tend to gravitate more towards the provable kind of government. That's proof.
5361360	5367360	There's a photo, you know, seriously, what happens when we die guys? Can we come to a consensus
5367360	5373440	right here on the stage right now? What I'm saying is they're, they're, we, we don't know
5374160	5378720	really, I want spirits to exist in demons and shit. I haven't seen anything, but man,
5378720	5383920	that would be so cool. It would be live it up. Mine. I know. I just heard people keep sending
5383920	5389760	me links to this Navy, uh, UFO thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It might. People might yell
5389760	5394160	at me for having you guys on stage and not bringing that up. Right. Okay. Because I live
5394160	5399120	in gravel. Like I'm separated from the earth and I've gotten from more than one person. Like,
5399120	5402960	have you seen this? So that must mean everyone's talking about it. The little flippy crafts where
5403840	5409840	the Tom DeLong thing to me, it just reminds me, it's like the same old shit. It's like,
5409840	5416400	but it's, it's funny to watch like a new generation saying the exact same things about the exact same
5416400	5421520	amount of obfuscation. And like, it's just sort of like they, they're like, there's articles about
5421520	5426960	people going like, yeah, there's three categories of these things. There's the diamond shaped ones.
5426960	5431760	I'm like, yeah, this is all the same stuff from the seventies. Have you guys been following this
5431760	5438800	like Navy footage? Yeah. So this, this ties into the way to, uh, the way to identify
5439520	5443920	something that might have some sand to it versus something that's sort of, uh, you know,
5443920	5451280	a creepy pasta. Cause we're also like conspiracy theory, uh, itself is a genre of folklore.
5451280	5456560	That is like, that is an accurate question was asking, which maybe we don't have an answer to
5456560	5463440	is can you tell one that has like a political weaponized stinger on it? Like, oh, Jenny McCarthy
5463440	5468960	wants you to not vaccinate your children. So she reverse engineered a story about Ben Franklin
5468960	5475680	vaccinating his kid. Yeah. Yes. The, that's exactly it. So, uh, quick way to identify something that
5475680	5479920	might have some sand with it is usually it's people who have some sort of power, whether financial
5479920	5485680	right. Or socio political who want more of it and have figured out, don't want to lose what they
5485840	5490480	don't want to lose what they have to that conversation. The thing that's interesting
5490480	5498000	about UFO, uh, calm, uh, common ideas is that we conflate the idea that there's something in
5498000	5505920	the sky, which most people don't understand. We conflate that with the idea that extraterrestrials
5505920	5512320	a give a shit enough about this planet that they would, they would span the vast chasms
5512320	5518080	of time and space to show up and like stick things up people's butts. It's the, that's a weird,
5518080	5523200	uh, that's, you know, let's say you're being reductive there. I am being, I am being reductive.
5523200	5527520	I am being reductive because we don't know what they do when they get here. We might perceive it
5527520	5533360	as they stuck something up my butt because of our tendency to like, that's, that's our takeaway.
5533360	5536640	We're very butt centric. We're like, then they put something in my butt and the aliens are
5536640	5540800	like watching the news and going like, what we did more than that. Yeah. They're like,
5540800	5545280	we taught them agriculture. It's technically the way it's like if our dogs described,
5545280	5549520	like the, I was taking them for a walk and like, oh, he fucking choked me and he's going to string
5549520	5554480	him and I was like, well, come on. You were wagging your tail. I don't know. That's a,
5554480	5560160	that's a really good point. And the, the thing is though, like, uh, we're also, I would, I would
5560160	5564880	further add to that point that we are, we are operating from our understanding of physics,
5564880	5568960	right? We are operating from our understanding as reality in the world as we perceive it,
5568960	5575280	which is at best kind of a shitty flashlight in a very big, very dark room. But, uh, we,
5575920	5581200	what we know and what we can prove we know, uh, what we can all agree on is that, yeah,
5581200	5588000	we see shit in the sky. We don't know what it is. It is literally an unidentified flying object.
5588000	5592800	Yeah. And that doesn't, that doesn't mean that it's anything other. Uh, also, uh, we have a
5592800	5600000	government that spends billions and billions and billions of undocumented money making shit
5600000	5605760	that is now real. This is true that we're not going to see for 10, 15. Yeah. There is an area
5605760	5613200	51. That's just a thing. Yes. And they're always the shit out of it. Did you see that guy who did
5613200	5619600	the Naruto on? Holy shit. Yeah. Like, no, it's, it's not good for a first world empire that's
5619600	5625280	in charge of everything. And it has unlimited spending to have a place, uh, where, uh, cameras
5625280	5630000	can watch them do the equivalent of all the black and white footage of the guys, uh, trying to
5630000	5636960	invent the helicopter. Like groom link is right. It's just like that. It's the area 51 is just a
5636960	5643840	place where the air force is constantly trying and failing to make like diamond shaped helicopters.
5644560	5648320	And then, and then people are like, whoa, look at that. And it's like, yeah, that's a,
5648320	5653840	it's gotta be, it's, I mean, I'm not a guy that doesn't believe in aliens. I just, uh,
5654560	5662080	I just, yeah, I think that any, any, anybody that was ever visiting us, I, why would they send,
5663680	5669040	it's not going to, I just, yeah. Is there a little dude in a thing going like,
5669040	5676000	man, humans, I'm watching them with my sports car that I fly. It's like, obviously no, they would,
5676000	5680800	they'd probably poke a hole in space and time. And the thing that popped out would likely not
5680800	5685920	be visible to us. It'd be the equivalent of a drone or something, right? What's the conspiracy
5685920	5694320	we should have paid attention to, but did not that we white water is milk. David Copperfield.
5695200	5700720	We might have, we might have three different answers. Yeah. What do you think that, um,
5700720	5705440	just before we get there, the important thing with you, that's just milk.
5705600	5713200	It was an inside job. Milk was an inside job. The important thing with the, with the UFO
5713200	5716880	story was that we know about project blue book and a bunch of these projects that occurred from
5716880	5722560	the forties onward up that we're studying the government studying UFOs. What is it? What could
5722560	5726640	it possibly be? Uh, it had to do with the cold war as well as we got into that era, just trying
5726640	5731280	to figure out which country maybe is outclassing us with technology. Should be worried about that.
5731280	5735840	Well, agreed at that time. But then the official story was that it went away. We don't, we're not
5735840	5740000	worried about anything like that anymore. That's that stuff is hogwash. There's no extra terrestrials.
5740000	5745040	Everything's fine. Then this footage gets leaked and then we find out that, wait, in fact, our
5745040	5750240	government has been studying unidentified flying objects this whole time. And there's a lot of data
5750240	5755040	there. And there are people that you know about like names within our government that were actually
5755040	5759840	Tom DeLong. No, it wasn't Tom DeLong. There are, there are people in the Senate that were running
5759840	5764800	stuff. I mean, how did, how did it make you guys feel when, cause the big headline of that
5764800	5772640	thing seems to be that the Navy said in an uncharacteristic, like they were like, yes,
5772640	5777440	that's legit. They tried to get in front of it. We didn't want you to see it. I found it weirdly
5777440	5782240	underwhelming. Why is that? Isn't that sad that I found it so underwhelming? I couldn't tell. In
5782240	5786320	this day and age, when everything's been so stirred up, I was sort of like, my, I guess my,
5786320	5792720	my gut was sort of like, ah, is everybody just so scared right now that, that like we're just
5792720	5798640	being gentle people now? Like, like, like, like, like that, that the Navy's like, like some guy
5798640	5802880	who's in charge, he's like, you know, I'm probably going to get fired tomorrow for like saying the
5802880	5808480	wrong thing about a haircut. So like, what is my job for real? Like, am I going to be an admiral
5808480	5812640	tomorrow? Am I going to end up the secretary of state? Probably I get like, like I've, I've had
5812640	5817200	this conversation with my fiance. I'm going to fucking play it as it lays. And it came across
5817200	5821680	his desk and he's like, just tell him the truth, Henderson. And Henderson's like the truth, sir.
5821680	5826400	He's like, you heard me at ease, do whatever. It's like, like, tell him what's it like. Yeah,
5826400	5832560	it leaked. It's not footage that the Navy hands out. We don't know if it's a fucking alien,
5832560	5838640	but like, fuck it. Things are like operating bureaucratically. That was just like the Navy
5838640	5845840	says real footage of a real UFO. Don't know if it's an alien. Yes. Those bros you hear flying
5845840	5851440	those top gun planes. That's them going like, what the fuck, bro? That is then as opposed to
5851440	5855600	the traditional thing of like, we can either confirm or deny those are you and you who got to
5855600	5860720	me? Yeah. And it was like, I, that was my, that was what my heart said. But then I had to follow
5860720	5865200	it up with like panic of like, ah, that's what they know. This is what they want you to think.
5865280	5870240	But disinformation within that realm is just the norm. I mean, if you think about the Vietnam War,
5870240	5874480	what was allowed to actually be reported within the United States of what's going on for strategic
5874480	5879840	advantage, something like that. If we're, if there are actually extraterrestrial species of some sort
5879840	5886800	or some faction visiting us, then why on earth would anyone who knows about it, who's afraid
5886800	5891600	for national security purposes, for humanities purposes, why would they ever come out on any
5891600	5897200	news source anywhere and say, yes, this is a thing. Like they, I can't imagine that ever occurring,
5897200	5902080	but also people are very terrible at keeping secrets, like super shitty. That's certainly
5902080	5907760	what we've learned. Yeah. Like, I mean, we, and we've pitted the height of like,
5907760	5914320	this could profit you against it. Like we have seen people definitely facing, like we've been
5914320	5921600	so cynical about the, the supposed incentive of like, well, nobody wants to get fired and
5921600	5927120	everyone just does what they're supposed to do. And it's like a jumper cable has been attached
5927120	5931280	to the wrong post of a, of a, of a system. And I'm not saying it's perfect and has any
5931280	5936960	kind of inherent like integrity to it, but it's just like, like this weird fucking rando dude,
5936960	5943440	like has, has revealed that most human beings, even if they work on a government payroll are
5943520	5950000	kind of like, uh, cool. Yes, sir. I'll do that. God damn it. Do you diary? This motherfucker made
5950000	5955840	me do some fucked up shit. Hey, Stacy, if I get shot tomorrow, tell him Stacy's like, what did
5955840	5959760	you just tell me what I think you do? I gotta, you know, I gotta tell Marshall, tell Marshall,
5959760	5963920	fuck you. I was like, like, I'm finished with my job. This motherfucker told me to do some crazy
5963920	5968160	shit. Yeah. I quit. Well, you should quit. Well, then I did quit. You're a whistleblower. So are
5968160	5972240	you who you should quit. And meanwhile, he's like, you're fired. You're fired. You're fired. And
5972240	5977920	everybody it's, it's working the same way as Starbucks does. And I find that refreshing that
5977920	5983040	they're not so different. I, I, that's the one layer of it that I'm like, this is all working the
5983040	5989920	exact way I would think human beings that are, that they're on, they're not all, uh, weird people in
5989920	5995680	warehouses, keeping the Illuminati secrets from us that that it's been exposed that they're mostly
5995680	6002240	just Dunder Mifflin. Right. And, and to, to, to what you're saying, like there's this paradigm shift
6002240	6008000	and it goes to like the cost of information, right? Uh, in the fifties, for instance,
6008000	6014160	people would say, you know, if, if we're a G person, we're a government agent, we would say,
6014160	6020320	well, the truth can't get out. People learn about shit through, you know, one of the following 16
6020320	6027680	ways. We'll shut those 16 ways down. And now that there are billions, uh, I, I always think about like,
6027680	6033520	if you guys ever growing up and your parents did something fallible and human and you were like,
6033520	6040160	what the fuck? Yeah, someone's supposed to be in charge. You know what I mean? And, uh, and like,
6040160	6048640	I can't believe mom just threw my birthday cake at my dad. Yeah. Did I turn 10 or not? Yeah, right.
6048640	6054640	Exactly. And so seeing, seeing that fuck it moment from the Navy or from people who are
6054640	6060640	supposed to be kind of psychologically a fill in for an authoritarian figure, it's a lot like the
6060640	6064480	cake throwing, not to mention what you said at the top of the show about how like that level of
6064480	6069680	cooperation just doesn't happen. I mean, it really doesn't. I mean, I think Matt is.
6069920	6083200	Unless it's an internment camp. Yep. Ah, unless it's a Grenada invasion or a government toppling,
6083200	6091120	say the Panama now, then you have multi levels of agencies coming together, trading information
6091120	6097040	between each other, sending agents in. Well, you can count on, you can count on America. Sorry to
6097040	6100880	interrupt you, but yeah, which is, it's like, it's like, yeah, you look at a black box and it's like
6100880	6110080	you, it's, it's, it's effortless. The silence. If, uh, everyone's on the same page, it's, uh,
6110720	6119200	it that that's, it's like relative, like outside the box of America, uh, conspiracies abound
6119200	6126880	because it with lots of cooperation because it's, it's all dead man switches where if no one hits a
6126960	6135120	button, nothing happens. And, uh, yeah, I'm I would, I would counter though. I would counter though.
6135840	6140800	How did everybody in this room immediately know the three to four things you named?
6140800	6144560	Because I didn't. Oh, okay. Well, I just recognized them as problematic.
6145760	6151040	I'm just like, Oh yeah, no, for sure. Like honestly, but I, I only point that out actually
6151040	6156240	because that's part of how it works is that there is no point to understanding what's happening in
6156240	6162720	Nicaragua, Granada. There's no point in understanding these sort of boring details. And,
6162720	6169440	and that part of politics is to try to put things in that box. Like healthcare is it like the forces
6169440	6174800	that be like, they, they try to put health, they try to make healthcare feel like the invasion of
6174800	6180960	a foreign country in central America. They, they try it like whatever I'm derailing it, but, but like
6180960	6187520	it is interesting point you're making, which is actually 250 million people can effectively
6187520	6194080	relative to Ethiopia. They can, they could keep a real big secret. Yeah. Like no one blows any
6194080	6200000	whistles on Cambodia. No one blows any whistles on anybody in a third world country. Like, like,
6200000	6202960	like from their perspective, you wonder how those people feel. They go like, God damn,
6202960	6208720	you people work together pretty, pretty nicely. I mean, absolutely. It's not, it's even more,
6209520	6215440	from where I'm sitting, there's incredible, incredible cooperation. There's, and that's the
6215440	6220160	interesting thing about conspiracy theories. And just real quick is that it depends on what side
6220160	6224000	of the coin you're on, whether or not you believe in them. If you have, if you have seen a system
6224000	6231200	actively hunt, kill, find, maim, destroy entire communities, then when somebody drops a conspiracy
6231200	6236000	theory on you, you're like, yeah, that sounds probable. But if you have lived in a privileged
6236080	6241120	society and you've been a beneficiary of that privilege, you're like, why the fuck would anybody
6241120	6245760	coordinate Tony and marketing? You ever try to get Tony and marketing to do something? Right.
6245760	6249440	Yeah. Right. So from definitely from where you're sitting there, it looks like people aren't that
6249440	6255200	fucking smart, but I really can tell you how smart they get. Well, CIA, uh, crack cocaine.
6255200	6261200	That's a great example of an actively thing. That's a great example of an actively perpetrated
6261200	6266240	and relatively easy to prove conspiracy. But here's the perfidious insidious part.
6266240	6273280	It's not so much about keeping a secret as it is about devaluing the truth. Right. So, so again,
6273280	6279120	the things you name, sure, people can black box, as you said, Dan, a secret for some, some set
6279120	6285040	amount of time. Eventually the truth outs, right? Well, eventually the truth becomes more valuable
6285040	6292480	than the crack. Right. And so then we have to ask ourselves, what crack are we smoking
6293280	6298640	that like what that gets you high for that is worth money for 60 years. That's worth more than
6298640	6306000	the truth. I see what you're saying. What defeats conspiracy is a transparency and a ground game.
6306000	6310880	That is people talking amongst each other. So that is one of the reasons I feel like
6310880	6315280	certain communities are able to survive those conspiracies, no matter what the cooperation is
6315280	6320720	on the other end. It's because of the price of this particular item in this neighborhood
6320720	6326160	has changed or has not changed. You can't talk to me about global markets. Do you know what I'm
6326160	6331840	saying? Yes. Okay. Absolutely. Because it's the, the, the, the question here, it also becomes a
6331840	6340080	question of, um, I love that you said transparency because what people dismiss as conspiracies,
6340560	6348800	whether, whether it might be demonstrably untrue or very provably a fact, uh, the, the one thing
6348800	6355600	those have in common is that speculation thrives in the absence of transparency. And then also
6355600	6361440	people are, you know, people are inherently narcissistic, which is not necessarily a bad
6361440	6367920	thing. People are explaining the story of themselves to a worldview. So like these, uh,
6367920	6373040	like the far right deep state people are always there. They're not looking at stuff that makes
6373040	6379680	them go, Oh, I should change the way I approach it. They're not like, I have a teaching moment
6379680	6384560	or a learning thing here. They're always like, Oh yeah, I was fucking more right than I thought it
6384560	6390880	was on multiple levels. And so what I appreciate here is, uh, the point that you're raising that
6390880	6396640	we have to emphasize, it is, we have to emphasize that, highlight it, italicize it. I don't give a
6396640	6402080	fight. The important part here, but just put apostrophes everywhere. Let's just put apostrophes.
6402080	6405600	I'm sure it'll, you know, yeah. And if the, if the New York times remove them,
6405600	6409520	then they're trying to make us look stupid and then they're in on it. But the, the thing is that
6410080	6421440	that the people are not idiots. People are not stupid. Whenever we run into a, um, a community
6421440	6428480	that has something that is demonstrably, uh, from the first approach seems untrue or seems crazy.
6429120	6434400	You have to listen to those people because they're not making it up for shits and giggles.
6434400	6442560	Nobody's serious. Like nobody woke up one day and said, uh, Hey, I think, uh, the, I think this
6442560	6449280	law enforcement department and this part of this community is actively hunting these people.
6449280	6454240	Nobody said, you know, what would be funny? You know, it would be a real, like just a great bit,
6454240	6458320	right? That, that comes from a real place. Women didn't come together and go, let's fuck with
6458320	6463440	them on equal pay. Let's see what happens. We'll lie about how much we make on the dollar. We'll
6463440	6468720	keep it to see what we actually get paid more. Right, right. Well, fair enough. Prisons are
6468720	6473760	great. All those secrets. So let's amend it to say let's, if we want to be completely clear,
6473760	6480880	let's amend it to say that, um, groups of people or institutions or, you know, organizations,
6480880	6485280	religious groups, whatever you want to, however people get together and hang out,
6485280	6491120	they are capable of cooperating when as Noel said, they are either preserving what they see
6491120	6497920	as their status quo, or they are increasing what they see is like the share of whatever pie they
6497920	6503200	have made in their head. Going back to your idea of non corporeal, I mean, articles of faith, right?
6503200	6506480	Yeah. That's ultimately what it is. Well, I think that's a really interesting thought to,
6506480	6511680	to, to, to arrive at is the, because I certainly, I never parsed conspiracy theory in that sense,
6511680	6518000	that actually, if you, if you unhitch from the stigma that the historical stigma that says
6518000	6523120	conspiracy theory is a term of abuse, like you said, um, and then you start to ask, well,
6523120	6527920	what is a conspiracy and what is a theory? And then start to actually probably the most valuable
6527920	6534720	way we can like, uh, digest conspiracy theories and start to ask ourselves, in what way am I
6534720	6541440	a Bilderberg and what, in what way am I like someone else's conspiracy? Because that's like,
6541440	6548960	why was I, why do I have this, uh, life and who doesn't have this life? And from their perspective,
6550400	6556240	is it possible? I'm in cahoots with my neighbor, even though I don't like him, uh, as a, but like
6556240	6560960	from someone else's perspective, couldn't you say I'm in cahoots with them and like to kind of
6560960	6564800	like actually look at life in terms of those connections, which is really just another way
6564800	6570880	of saying problematization. Like you're looking at who's benefiting and who's not. Uh, what a drag.
6570880	6576640	But, uh, I mean, for me anyway, it's true. Uh, I have nothing to gain from it. So I'm probably
6576640	6581920	just going to convince everybody that the Jews are controlling them. Oh, that didn't get a big
6581920	6588160	enough laugh. It's too real. God, it's too close to the holidays. My fiance is one. Come on. I'm not
6588160	6592960	anti-Semitic. It's impossible. Yeah, that's right out there with some of my best friends. You can't
6592960	6599520	have sex with people you hate. When does that ever happen? No, never. There's a billion of us.
6599520	6602720	I, my girlfriend's probably watching this, so I didn't say anything.
6604800	6608960	Sometimes I say things that I think, I'm like, wow, this will get a great, big laugh.
6608960	6612480	Because the joke is I could never be that shitty a person. And everyone's like,
6612480	6618480	huh. And the worst part, the worst part is if you see someone in the back going, yeah,
6620720	6626480	hopefully you're not back there. Oh boy. In my dream. I mean, that would, I'd take that over
6626480	6634960	the judgment. But these Adams, they got a guy that's just a hand. He's just like a hand. He's
6634960	6642800	walking around. Yeah. It's Armand down. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.
6645920	6652880	Rob's Rob, Spencer, Grendan, once again, Matt, and Darren Harmon, of course. I've been Brandon
6652880	6658160	Johnson. We wish you a happy birthday. Jeff Davis. We miss you so much. Watch creep show.
6658160	6663040	Rob Schwab in the house, downtown dynasty theater, Sarah Hill,
6663040	6668240	Nolan Fabricas, Zach McKeever up in the booth. You know how we get down. Good night.
6669600	6673760	Listen to stuff they don't want you to know on the stuff you should know network.
6675280	6680720	Shout out to Matt Riddle right there in the front. He's the reason we were able to be here tonight.
6680720	6685120	Fantastic. Thank you, other man. Good. Good to meet you. All right. And I'm going to be on their
6685120	6696160	podcast. Well, we're recording tomorrow, but thanks for coming out.
6708640	6709600	Did you get any of that?
6709600	6715280	It's a good show.
