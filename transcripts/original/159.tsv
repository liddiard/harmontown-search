0	17200	From Hollywood, California, the nexus of entertainment and sexiness, to the Meltdown Theater at Meltdown Comics and Nerdmelt and Melty Melts,
17700	20200	Hermitown is now in session.
26200	27200	Wow.
30200	33200	Tonight's attendance, 72,000 people.
38200	42200	Let's bring out the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden.
48200	54200	And just for old time's sake, let's bring out the mayor of Hermitown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
58200	59200	Thank you.
60200	61200	Thank you very much.
63200	66200	It's a bigger crowd. We're always sold out, but it's a...
67200	68200	Is it big? It sounds big.
69200	70200	We're always sold out.
72200	74200	But this is extra sold out.
75200	80200	I don't think we're more sold out. I think these people are just more vigorous, more exciting.
81200	87200	Let's not kid ourselves, Jeff. The reason they're packed to the rafters tonight is not because of you or me or Spencer.
88200	92200	It's because last week we pointed out there was no ice scooper.
93200	96200	Oh, shit!
96200	103200	And they wanted to be here for the big unveiling.
104200	108200	Dan, kick it off and scoop me some motherfucking ice out of that thing.
111200	113200	Spencer, talk to Jeff while I make Jeff a drink.
114200	115200	All right. Hey, how's it been going, Jeff?
116200	120200	It's been good. I've been traveling. I'm a little travel-weary, but I'm very good.
121200	122200	When did you get back in, Jeff?
122200	125200	I just got back in a couple of days ago, but it was a...
128200	130200	They love a couple of days.
142200	147200	That was a parody of when they do that, right?
148200	151200	It's like the movie Cocktail. You're Tom Cruise in here right now.
152200	153200	It was a parody.
156200	157200	Thank you, Mr. Harmon.
160200	162200	Okay, so Spencer...
163200	164200	Yeah, man.
165200	170200	What did you think about... I have to get a car, right? Spencer's been driving me around. I love it. You love it, kind of.
171200	172200	I love it. No, I love it.
173200	182200	But when you drove me... Did you register the anxiety level at UTA when we went there last week?
183200	190200	This happens... Spencer and I walk into a place together, because he drives me, and then I go, and then I'll have a meeting.
191200	194200	It's not a natural thing to have a chauffeur.
195200	200200	Well, I think it's the way of the land.
201200	206200	It's not, though. It's not the way of the waiting rooms where we go into.
207200	210200	So the person at the desk is always like, hello?
211200	218200	Spencer... Because he's like a squire. He's like an erstwhile squire. He drove me. He opened the doors.
219200	223200	He knew exactly where to go. I was just babbling about not wanting to tie my shoes the whole time.
224200	227200	Spencer gets to the desk, and then the person goes, can I help you?
227200	234200	And Spencer goes, Dan Harmon, to see whoever. Like, he announces me, which is amazing.
235200	237200	Well, I do that anywhere we go, though.
238200	244200	But then the receptionist goes, like, you're a dancer, and who's he? And he goes, no, this is Dan Harmon.
245200	247200	And then she goes, well, who are you? And he goes, I'm Spencer.
250200	253200	And then she's like, okay, do you guys want to water or Diet Coke or anything?
253200	259200	We'll take waters. And we go sit down. And then she's like, Dan and Spencer are here for the three o'clock meeting.
260200	268200	And then you just have to let it go. You're like, it would be weird at any point to, like, stop the momentum and go, like, let me explain something here.
269200	271200	That's weird and takes really long to explain.
272200	277200	Well, I think that I generally try to say, oh, don't worry about me when they ask what my deal is.
278200	286200	Well, don't you worry. I'll just be over here six feet tall with a two foot long beard.
287200	290200	I'll just be hiding over here the most interesting looking guy in the universe.
291200	294200	Don't worry about me, like, needs more context than that.
295200	302200	It shouldn't. I mean, those people, they're all about hospitality, so they just want to make sure we're adequately respected,
302200	306200	which is, you know, it comes to odds because I don't need that in those situations.
307200	311200	That's the last thing I need is validation from, you know, secretarial staff.
314200	321200	Is there a validation Spencer that you do, like, want or crave? Is there something you would like to hear from staff or anything?
322200	323200	From staff?
323200	324200	From strangers?
325200	330200	Well, I just want to just don't walk slowly, I think.
331200	332200	That'd be good enough.
333200	340200	What do you like to hear from people secretly, even if it's a little selfish and juvenile and not mentally healthy to want it?
341200	343200	What's something that really puts a wind in your face?
344200	348200	A secret thing you wish strangers said or thought about you as you walked into a building?
348200	361200	I like things that are useful or being useful to people. So that my manifest is I'll be all like, hey, man, did you know if you're gagging, you can put your thumb through your hand like that Buzzfeed article said, not gag.
362200	365200	And then that people will be like, that helps me. And then I'll be like, that's good.
366200	369200	But yeah, I want to. Yeah, I want to. You want to be useful.
370200	374200	I want to increase the the satisfaction of people's lives.
374200	383200	Wait. Oh, I'm sorry. You you wish people would say, give you life saving tips or you wish you wish people would say, oh, you're used.
384200	387200	I wish they'd appreciate the utility that I offer.
388200	392200	Well, you're in a good position because you have a lot of utility.
393200	400200	You're a healthy example of somebody who knows what they knows their needs and gets their needs met. That's what my therapist would say.
401200	414200	Yeah, Dan, if you walked into an office building and like in a like in a busy office corporate setting, what would you wish like the gatekeeper is like the security person or like the people that you have to walk past?
415200	417200	What do you wish they thought about you on site?
418200	419200	Whoa.
426200	427200	It is he.
428200	429200	The chosen one.
431200	440200	We better get our shit together. Like, I mean, for real, like, no, I am being for real. I mean, we're we're living in a fantasy world where let's let's let's make a fantasy.
441200	452200	You go into a corporate building like Century City Plaza, like to go like a business meeting, you get into an elevator, everybody in the elevator.
453200	468200	There's men, there's women, they're well dressed. You don't know what they do for a living. They could be high, low status, comparatively. What do you wish in your fantasy, selfish, egotistical brain? What do you wish everybody in that elevator was thinking?
469200	473200	Well, I had something teed up, but then you asked the wrong question.
474200	485200	Because I like my fantasy was that one of the one of the people in the whole elevator would go, oh, Mr. Harmon, no, I'm sorry. And then press a secret button on the elevator.
486200	497200	And then the side of the elevator would open. And it would be like there would be like fog and lights and I would just be like in my hoodie, like Mark Zuckerberg and I'd go to the other people.
498200	512200	So I guess the answer to your question is I wish everyone on the elevator thought, what is he doing on this elevator?
513200	520200	Pick the person on that on the elevator that you hate the most. What do you wish that person was thinking when that happened, when you went out the side door?
521200	522200	Wait, sorry, I didn't miss the time of that.
523200	531200	So you get secret side elevator door status and you have your Zuckerberg hoodie on and you leave and you're like, sorry.
532200	542200	The person that you hated the most on site when you went in the elevator, what do you wish he or she were thinking as that happened, like to make you the most happy?
543200	547200	Oh, I was wrong about football.
553200	561200	Or all the crunches in the world couldn't lift my spirit right now.
561200	576200	I had pizza for breakfast. I've eaten nothing but almonds for six weeks and he gets to go through the side of an elevator.
577200	585200	What happens? I mean, like, let's fantasize. What happens at the side of the elevator? Does it get you to the floor that you're going to faster?
585200	590200	Or does it take you to another realm?
591200	595200	Well, I mean, people go into a building and they go up and down. That's like, that's like people's shit.
596200	599200	And you'll be in a world of pure imagination.
600200	607200	The truth is that way. This is a fucking lie. This is a rat race. Oh, I hope I get to the 35th floor.
608200	614200	Psych. The real people go this way. Me and D.L. Hughley.
615200	619200	Isn't he the one with the special purple door at the airport?
620200	622200	Harman Town Deep Cut.
625200	630200	Well, I think that's, I mean, you know, we have special friends here tonight. That's probably why it's really packed.
631200	637200	I just wanted to tell you guys that I have a lot of paralysis when I when I talk to people in person.
638200	639200	But I could get into that later.
641200	643200	Like, I don't really know how to talk to people. And that's and that's that's the.
644200	648200	But I think in the last few shows you've gone through leaps and bounds where you have done very good interviews.
649200	656200	No, but you but you're talking about this is a lie up here. I'm talking about like actual like riding in the Uber when the Uber driver goes,
656200	658200	I'm going to go to Fountain.
660200	666200	He's shorter. He's shorter. You could go. You could go down Holly. We can keep going down Hollywood.
669200	673200	No, no, no. Fountain. Fountain. And then I just go.
676200	681200	I don't want because I don't want to I don't want to talk. I don't want to talk to you. And it's not even about the conflict.
681200	687200	It's like, I don't know how it hurts to talk to people. It makes it's like showering. It's like hurts my skin.
688200	698200	And like when we were in New York and I like like like when I was I was walking outside that restaurant and the waitress because it was Dino's favorite restaurant.
699200	706200	Everyone knows Dino's. Everyone knows us. And and the waitress runs into me out there and she goes, hey, how are you?
706200	713200	Hey, have you met Wes Anderson and Spike Jones? And I'm like, and she points to the window of the restaurant and there they are.
714200	719200	And I'm like, no. She's like, you should meet him. And I'm like, no, I shouldn't.
722200	732200	That's like royalty, first of all. And like I'm like, you're royalty. And I'm like, that's the problem right there is that you saying that and that whole thing being there.
732200	743200	Like I there's tears and I know what nothing to do with this. Like I if I was dragged me in and she said, Wes, Spike, do you know Dan Harmon?
744200	756200	OK, that's a nightmare. And they're like, no. And I'm like, hi. Nice to meet you. Also, I'm going to go in the back. And I could have done that anyway.
756200	761200	I don't think I would know if I sat down next to them, which one was which. I don't know. I didn't know which one was which either.
763200	770200	And I'm happy about this. We Wikipedia it later and my guess would have been wrong because they look very different.
770200	780200	But I thought I thought, you know what? These guys are masters of the lateral. I bet the guy you think is Spike Jones looks like Wes Anderson.
781200	787200	And I was right, except I was wrong. So I would have made an ass of myself.
787200	792200	So how did that cover? Did you sit with him or just walk by like like like meeting the queen?
792200	798200	I just I just I just I'm forty two. So it wasn't like I didn't I didn't like fuck. My whole goal is just leave only footprints.
798200	806200	I just I just said, I just said, hello. Nice to meet you. I made eye contact. I breathed regularly and I just I just shook their hands and I made eye contact.
806200	813200	I didn't I didn't go in for the double cup weird like sexy handshake. I just I just shook their hands. I said, hi. Nice to meet you.
813200	821200	Hi. Nice to meet you. It's very, very, very exciting and weird to meet you guys. And I and I walked away and I feel like I won by doing that.
821200	831200	Do you think that they knew who you were? No, no. I hate the question. I mean, I wonder is that you're not not a celebrity, but I wonder if you are on their radar or not.
831200	839200	But I but I well, I could have I could have like like through work, you know, having a studio and stuff like there was if I had known which one was Spike for sure by looking at him.
839200	845200	I could have there was like an in road there. I could have said, oh, we have mutual friends boobity boobity booboo.
845200	852200	But I just boned out and I think I'm a better person for it. But it wasn't but it wasn't about it wasn't about politics.
852200	858200	It wasn't about it wasn't about it wasn't about star fucking versus like nervousness or anything like that. I'm talking about like that could happen with anybody.
858200	878200	I don't like talking to anybody like like I like I've just gotten able to like do the thing like like, you know, when people with somebody says like, like, it's like I forged this world like I'm like Sauron like I like I like I created this dumb, like weird world for myself where I could be comfortable.
878200	895200	And it's like, like, every little every little aspect of it is engineered, including the fact that like, the only physical social interactions that I can handle are people like, like, like on a sidewalk going like getting excited when they see me and pointing at me.
895200	900200	So so that I know, like, it's done where there is no, we don't have to worry about anything.
900200	907200	If you meet somebody like at a restaurant or anywhere, Uber driver that doesn't know who you are, that's, that's never fun for you.
907200	911200	No, God, no, no. It's physical pain.
911200	922200	But I've been around you when I've like, when you stumble on to common ground with a stranger, and you can go Oh, you get really excited about that. But that's always when I'm being introduced to them through a friend or something like that.
922200	931200	Like when you're hanging out, you know, having drinks and some of this. Oh, this is Molly and she's a friend of someone's house. It's like, Oh, what do you do? I'm an astronaut. Oh, Jesus Christ.
931200	940200	I have like 90 astronaut questions. And then, yeah, it's it's I mean, those that that yeah, that's that's good. That's fine.
940200	949200	So that's not 90% of like how you have to talk to people like you have to talk to people who are scooping ice cream. If you like ice cream, you have to talk to the ice cream person.
949200	957200	They're like, well, how many scoops do you want? And you're just like, I can just fucking like my brain just explodes.
957200	968200	That's so funny. Because like, that's my favorite thing is what are you doing? Is that your phone? What's back here?
968200	978200	I'm like infatuated with strangers like and the the the person sitting next to you is the most interesting thing in the world to me.
978200	986200	Because of the the freefall, the chaos of that moment, when you're talking to somebody and you go, I don't know if we have anything in common at all.
986200	995200	Sometimes you find out, okay, this person is kind of a bummer or you go, Oh, this person worked on the fucking Saturn five rocket like that. That's fucking amazing.
995200	1007200	But that moment for you is more torture for. Yeah, I think we both agree that it's like falling off something and and you're just like, I love that.
1008200	1018200	I hate that. But I feel like I'm I'm honest. And you're like a Patrick Swayze thrill seeker or something.
1018200	1029200	I mean, I like it because you can find out. I can be very misanthropic and very philanthropic from moment to moment, depending on the quality of the person sitting next to you.
1029200	1039200	But it's time when like I get really endlessly fascinated by a stranger. You do, too. But you're you come at it from a very like, Holy shit.
1039200	1049200	I just got fit, fill and thropic versus misanthropic fill as like file like like pedophile like children. Yeah. Yeah.
1049200	1055200	Like like like like that's not the file word that you like are the most familiar with.
1055200	1062200	God damn it. How about you guys are always catching me. You could have started Philadelphia.
1062200	1067200	Well, I know. Well, I've done. Yeah. Philadelphia. Yeah. I'm just getting that now, though. That's what I'm saying.
1067200	1075200	Like Miss Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss Anthropy versus philanthropy. I didn't get the fill misogyny.
1075200	1088200	Well, philogeny. I love Chinese. I love those Chinese up and down Fifth Street, Fourth Avenue.
1088200	1100200	How you do, young lady? See, you got a hole where your wiener should be. Got a tiny. I love your Chinese because I'm a feminist and I'm a town.
1100200	1115200	All right. Thank you. Thanks, kids. Our next guest is no stranger to Chinese. Andrew Lloyd Webber.
1115200	1124200	I do want to bring him out because we're it's hot up here. And I want you to see that I'm not the only one that sweats this much.
1124200	1131200	And I guess I always feel like I think you guys know it's hot in this room, but it's six degrees cooler where you're sitting.
1131200	1142200	I'm telling you. And then you look at me and you go, he's so disgusting. I'm hotter than you. Just a little hotter.
1143200	1158200	There's people sitting out there fanning themselves right now. It's like the like to kill a mockingbird, you know, it's I just come to bust up a ship a rope.
1158200	1166200	It's so hot in here that that civil rights are being like are back on the table.
1166200	1172200	It's automatically when it gets hot enough, every play, every room becomes a southern courtroom.
1172200	1179200	Tech textbooks may not be allowed in science class tomorrow, depending on what happens tonight, because it's so hot.
1179200	1184200	It's the next guest is Gregory Peck, everybody.
1184200	1193200	Old friend of the show. We miss him very much, but we're so glad he spent some time away because he's been busy and has done something really incredible.
1193200	1199200	Not that he had not done all kinds of incredible things. We were we were happy with him quite the way he was.
1199200	1207200	But he kind of if you're talking about the person I think you're talking about, he just deals in incredible humanity all the time.
1207200	1212200	That's what he does. He does it. And he does it for no reason. He does it because it's what he does.
1212200	1218200	It's he he's a magical like magic person. He's a magical magic person.
1218200	1223200	He's our friend. And let's talk about his new project, which everybody is going to be really excited to see.
1223200	1239200	Please welcome back Bobcat Goldthwaite.
1239200	1243200	Thank you.
1243200	1251200	That's really nice. You're what you the idea that people would be excited and happy to see that.
1251200	1258200	That's the worst thing that could happen to me. Oh, when people when people go, oh, well, people are happy and excited to see me.
1258200	1268200	I just don't want them to to I just want them to be normal. Well, you you're you're you're you're an actor turned director probably for the same reason.
1268200	1279200	And like your circumstances are so different. Like the idea that anybody would ever see me and point is is like kind of like it's for me.
1279200	1286200	That's the same as saying you should be prom king. But for what you're probably perceiving, that moment is like, oh, that's the guy from Police Academy.
1286200	1291200	This comes. Yeah. Yeah. I was in Detroit at a film festival and this guy's like, I'm your biggest fan.
1291200	1301200	And I took a picture with him and he's like, what do you do now?
1301200	1307200	You can. My biggest fan does not have access to IMDB. That's what I learned there.
1307200	1313200	And then but it was a good question. What would you want people to say, though, because they still have a big ego.
1313200	1320200	Like if they had I want them after I left that was him. I blew it. You know, so I do have a big ego.
1320200	1337200	I just kind of sad. But you're I mean, one of the things that's amazing about you now is that you're you you you you accomplish things psychologically that other people think are just kind of theories from from from from therapy and stuff.
1337200	1346200	Well, fuck you, Harmon, just talk. You had you've had to have a breach birth career wise in terms of because I had the game out first. Yeah.
1346200	1354200	I had the career most people have at the beginning at the end. Like I sold out at the beginning. Well, maybe I mean, it's just like you can use those words.
1354200	1363200	But but just more more to more to the objective point, like like you're you were first to famous for your hair and your voice and your face.
1363200	1368200	Yes. And I mean, you're not that you were not that that is not to say that your stand up wasn't awesome.
1368200	1375200	The but but people were like, my mom was like, that's the guy. That's the screechy screechy guy with the hair.
1375200	1382200	And then and then you. Yeah. And then you. But now I'm the mumbling bald guy who's making these amazing things.
1382200	1386200	And yeah, I would imagine that. Yeah. You're in disguise when you're at the mall. You're like, God damn it.
1386200	1395200	Nobody know when somebody wins. I got I got hit by TMZ, which I was shocked. It was in New York because in L.A. no one cares.
1395200	1403200	And and they were trying to agitate me. And the guy goes, they're making another police can be the rebooting.
1403200	1410200	Don't you think they should use the original cast? And I was like, no. And they go, why not?
1410200	1419200	I go, because a lot of us are dead. And then I said, if they're going to reboot it, they should do it.
1419200	1426200	They did the 21 Jones Street. They should make it a comedy this time. And that made the broadcast.
1426200	1434200	But then I said, this is what didn't make the broadcast. I said, it's not really the right time to be doing wacky police comedies.
1435200	1445200	I was like, the police are killing civilians. You know that. Police Academy Five, Ferguson.
1449200	1454200	Oh, Mahoney. That first movie in the 80s, it was like the central point of the irony, that crawl in the beginning.
1454200	1461200	It was like, oh, this crazy government. Now they're going to let it just anybody be a police and the you know, the and then it happened.
1462200	1467200	I'm scratching my head with my gun and I'm I don't know what to do with my gun. Bang, bang, bang, bang.
1467200	1477200	And it was like a joke that and now it's like a horrible reality. I get sometimes I'll be doing shows and I'll get someone will give me the police Academy DVD.
1477200	1488200	The first one. And I wasn't in that. And I just I just I'm not in this movie. Both the way you're not you're not in the first one.
1488200	1491200	You're in this. No, I didn't think the quality of the script was there. Yeah.
1493200	1502200	We're holding out for more of a story structure. Yeah. I said, this is shit. Come back to me when there's back to me when Winslow has more of an arc.
1502200	1510200	Yeah. When when when his when his when his entire squiggle doesn't sound exactly like his Nintendo squiggle.
1510200	1518200	Well, you know, he he he's he's that is a talent. I'm not going to just diminish what he does.
1518200	1523200	But, you know, he does that all day long. Those noises like he really does.
1523200	1533200	Like if we're talking, that's his, you know, you know, and one day it was really cold and miserable and reshooting a scene for the third time.
1533200	1541200	And we're in the basement of this building, avoiding the weather. And he found the you know, the doll, the inside of a paper towel, the tube.
1541200	1553200	And so that was, you know, it was like backlit when he found it because he could just, you know, you know, and it's like Perlman with a fucking shot.
1553200	1564200	Yeah. So he, you know, he's making his helicopter farts and just we're all trying to eat.
1564200	1574200	And I and I really feel bad. So this is a public apology to him. And I just finally go, Michael, no, no, no.
1574200	1587200	Swear to God. Slow clap in the cafeteria. Slow clap. I feel really bad in my mind when I think of that story and then a marching band came out.
1587200	1594200	Riptile it from confetti around. But but they're all playing toilet paper tubes.
1594200	1601200	All right. So since the last time we saw you, I think you were talking about this early on.
1601200	1609200	You were you were shooting footage back when we first made friends. I even think you've been working on this for a little while, calling it together.
1609200	1617200	You have this. Should we call him a mentor? Very definitely a mentor. The movies is a documentary I made. It's out now called Call Me Lucky.
1617200	1628200	And I started doing comedy when I was 16. Tom Kenny was 15 in Syracuse in this town. Next door, there is an ad that said they were looking for comedians.
1628200	1635200	And so because Tommy's always been amazing with voices, he called up as like a dude, you know, like he was an adult, not a teenager.
1635200	1643200	It's like, yeah, we're a couple of comedians. I swear to God. I think Wilford Brimley is coming in to do a set tonight.
1643200	1652200	And we showed up and there's Barry, you know, he's just such a character even back then, you know, he just looked up and he said,
1653200	1663200	is your parents driving? So so he, you know, if folks aren't aware of him, he's a political sadder still is.
1663200	1668200	And like my favorite Barry Cremins joke is, people say if you don't love this country, why don't you leave it?
1668200	1674200	He says, because I don't want to be victim by victimized by its foreign policies.
1675200	1685200	So a real sharp guy. And he started a club in Boston that that a lot of folks like Stephen Wright and Paula Poundstone, myself, a lot of people got their start in this room.
1685200	1690200	And he was he was definitely a mentor and the gatekeeper. Like if he thought you were derivative of anyone else, you didn't get on stage.
1690200	1696200	And so is Kevin Meaney and Steve Sweeney and Lenny Clark. All these comics came out of that scene and he he drove it.
1697200	1703200	I don't feel like the movie isn't it's about him. I think it's important people need him and stuff.
1703200	1710200	But what it's really about is is he during a performance disclosed on stage about his rapes when he was four.
1711200	1721200	And and he went, you know, then he he tried to process this. So so in the course of him processing it, he went online.
1721200	1730200	This is in the early 90s, mid 90s and AOL just started. So there was people exchanging child pornography in chat rooms and he complained to AOL and they didn't do anything.
1730200	1735200	And then he then he went to the cops and the cops in the movie say, you know, we didn't even have computers then.
1735200	1742200	So he poses kids, got all this evidence against AOL and then took AOL to the floor of the Senate during a judiciary hearing.
1742200	1748200	And it's it was like a camper story. This like, you know, nightclub comedian embarrassing this giant corporation.
1748200	1754200	And then afterwards there was a shift in him. What was the process for him? Like, like, how did he go? By the way, the movie's funny.
1754200	1765200	I know it sounds the movie's amazing. I mean, which is a story in and of itself is the fact that this is like you've made these movies that people adore because they're so punk rock.
1765200	1771200	They're so you there. And they're so there's some sort of just like if they're nothing else, they are.
1771200	1777200	They are you just trying to steer off of any conceivable road in front of you. Shakes a clown.
1777200	1784200	And like there's people there's people who like like and there's an there's an anger to that stuff, too.
1784200	1790200	So the irony is I don't see it. But yeah, I mean, you're laughing the whole time. But you're like, God bless America.
1790200	1801200	God bless America. When we shot a baby, I really thought I really it was like I wrote it, you know, she was don't you have a baby and he pumps a shotgun.
1801200	1810200	She throws it near and we shoot the baby. That was the only thing I've ever written that I thought some point someone is going to say, hey, man, you can't do this.
1810200	1817200	It never happened. I guess we're shooting a baby today. And I said, I will give me a baby that looks really ugly.
1817200	1825200	Like I wanted to look like someone shaved a pug, you know, and the baby came and it was really cute and it didn't cry.
1825200	1834200	And it would just sit there like, you know, and I feel bad about this, too. This is my men's stories.
1834200	1838200	This is a good place to do it. It's 25 years old. They love apologies and punishment.
1838200	1849200	So so so the baby didn't cry. The parents go. They come in. They go, what are we shooting today? I'm like your baby.
1849200	1858200	And then I realize nobody told him what this thing was about. So so we gave him some more money. And then that's true.
1858200	1866200	There's a stunt bump, I guess. So the baby just sat there just like this. So I have the parents with the dad.
1866200	1876200	I haven't walked off the set and the kid didn't give a shit. And then nothing took its biscuit out of its mouth.
1876200	1882200	Nothing just sat there. So then I'd love to tell you I'm a better man than this. But I got down on all fours and I put keys over the lens.
1882200	1890200	So it'd be looking in the right direction. And then I got right in the baby's face and I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
1890200	1901200	And the baby go. And whenever I would duck out of the way, the baby shut up immediately.
1901200	1906200	The keys were to get the attention. And then you were there to horrify the baby. Correct.
1906200	1913200	But as soon as my face wasn't there, it would just shut down. It was like that Michigan J frog, you know, like, hello, my baby.
1914200	1923200	You're running and getting the DP. You're like, I swear to God. He was crying. Sure he was, Bobcat. Free beer.
1923200	1931200	So I imagine like someday that it will be 10 and a police academy will come on and be like, ha!
1931200	1937200	And then you'll have your shot. I finally got it.
1937200	1947200	But anyways, so to whack schmaltzy about it or just at least kind of mythical, I mean, well, all of that, all of that awesome punk rock, anger, energy, whatever you call it.
1947200	1961200	You don't call it anger, but like cynical, whatever, like a non-establishment. And you had this father figure early on in your comedy career who had this scar in his life.
1962200	1971200	And then one of your, you know, you made all these different kinds of movies, like your most recent one before that is this, you know, is another weird turn for you that found footage like a Bigfoot movie.
1971200	1978200	Yeah. Yeah. Like that does not resemble Shakes the Clown that much. It's not like you're Rob Zombie trying to like, you're like, no, you don't get it yet.
1978200	1985200	No, I just like Bigfoot. The cheerleaders are dumb and they should be tortured. One more movie and I swear you're going to get it.
1986200	1995200	No, I just wanted to make a Bigfoot movie because I like Bigfoot and you cradle this guy with your, with your first documentary.
1995200	2006200	So yeah, so Barry, it's funny you say anti-establishment because I met him as a teenager and here's this guy who was totally anti-establishment and he didn't, he wasn't condescending to us. He actually encouraged it.
2006200	2015200	So, you know, that was that really, uh, how did he come out of it? Like, like, what's his, like, is he happy with what's what happened? Is that satisfying for him?
2015200	2016200	I don't think he is happy.
2016200	2021200	I mean, that's not happy, but he's the first one to make those jokes.
2021200	2037200	There's a scene in the movie where, uh, he actually goes into the basement that this happened in and I was just filming the basement because I thought that was way more powerful just to show these spaces, but I did not want him to go in there.
2037200	2047200	And he goes, you go through a problem, you know, you don't go around it. This isn't, there's no demons. I'm demystifying this space. I'm going down there. You can film it or not.
2047200	2048200	Had he been back there since?
2048200	2051200	No, no. He says it's not a place I like to hang out.
2051200	2052200	This is the first time when you read.
2052200	2064200	Yeah. So he, he was like, um, so we had a huge argument and, and, and, and I said, well, we just give me five minutes so I can roll and it's in the movie and it's very powerful.
2064200	2070200	And there was a reason I was trying to remember it, but, but one of the things happened is he's very eloquent in the basement.
2070200	2076200	And then afterwards, cause I knew it would happen. He went into shock, you know, he does this weird thing when he's going into shock and I knew that it was in shock.
2077200	2082200	And he goes, I can't remember what I said. Is any of it usable? And I said, oh, it doesn't matter. I'm going to play yakety sacks.
2088200	2096200	He said, um, and we were doing a Q and a and I said, you know, and I wanted to film the spaces and I didn't, I didn't want to do reenactments.
2096200	2098200	And he goes, you didn't want to do reenactments.
2098200	2110200	It works every time. But, but, but Bob, this, this, uh, this very emerge from this, like, is that more healing for him?
2110200	2121200	Yeah. Yeah. And at the, you know, the, the point of the movie for me was to show he comes out through the other side and not only he's not a person, a victim of this, as he says, I'm not a victim anymore.
2121200	2134200	It is about coming all the way through the other side. And, and, um, you know, he starts off the movies just full of rage and he's still angry, but you know, his targets are now, you know, more directed at people.
2134200	2139200	That's what that's, that's the thing that I want people listening to this for, as far as plugging the movie is concerned.
2139200	2146200	If you're, you know, because like the tough thing about good movies, especially ones that are profound that have to do with like insights into human darkness.
2146200	2154200	Like they're not always at the top of your list, like no matter how good you know, they'll be in the act of killing and everyone says it's a great movie.
2154200	2160200	I mean, it's the most important movie you'll ever see because, but, but, but, but the thing about that is that I keep saying to people like, yeah, but don't, don't worry about it.
2160200	2167200	It will not challenge you that way at the beginning. It's, it's, it's colorful and whimsical and ironic.
2167200	2172200	It's, it's, it's that's, and your movie is similar in that sense.
2172200	2179200	It's why I texted you halfway through it and was like, this is, this is really genius because there is, and it's something about Barry too.
2179200	2190200	And I think there's, I don't think I have the IQ or the vocabulary to articulate what, what the, what the real important thing about, about what's on the microscope slide there.
2190200	2207200	It has something to do with the fact that he's really smart and really funny and really autonomous and really unafraid of the entire United States government and all of mainstream society and anyone that could ever tell him that he's gross or fat or dirty or stupid.
2207200	2225200	He, he's, but, and, and, and that he's doesn't cut the silhouette therefore of somebody who is capable of having something so just, just so that's, this is where my vocabulary breaks down.
2225200	2242200	It's just the dichotomy is very interesting to me because he's not, it's like, we're used to breaking up the world into guys like that, that are like, he, he didn't, he didn't, he didn't say, oh my God, I was molested on stage and then, and then curl up in a ball and start sucking his thumb and then become really unfunny.
2242200	2254200	He became even funnier and even smarter and even stronger, but in a process though, he had to ask himself questions about like everything that he had ever thought are done and every formation of all.
2254200	2269200	And how do you know, even those of us who don't, can't point to a big red trauma on a map, we have to go to therapy and wonder how much of what, how much of what makes people chuckle when I talk has, is unhealthy and how much of it is like, I don't know.
2269200	2281200	It's, it's, it's a really, it's an important movie for that reason. It's just a, I, this is the, here, put this on the poster. I'm gonna give you a great quote. Even if he hadn't been molested, this would be a great documentary.
2281200	2293200	Well, because he's a really, really incredible, like, like, like people go, well, you know, did you pitch this movie? It's like, where?
2293200	2299200	Bob, hey, here's a comedian that you're not familiar with. No, wait, he gets raped as a kid.
2299200	2302200	Hear me out. Hear me out.
2303200	2306200	$10 million, Mr. Goldfarb.
2306200	2323200	What was it like? Like, did you get like, what was it like the journey for you on that movie? Like, did you think that you were going to get through that without it being hard? Did you know how hard it would be for you? Like, like, what was your journey through all that darkness and all that sadness?
2323200	2339200	Yeah, there was a, it was, you know, to, you know, I was very concerned for my friend and Barry says that whenever the movie would have come first, his, his wellbeing was always more important than making a movie, even if it was a movie about it.
2339200	2343200	But it was, it's been very hard, you know, and it's weird.
2343200	2346200	What did you, what did you go through? Like, what was your journey on that?
2346200	2359200	Well, it's now, you know, we've had a lot of success with the movie and we show screenings and people, you know, really like it. So I have to deal with that. I don't like success. And then there's no,
2359200	2368200	but there's, there's often after the movie, you know, adult survivors come out when they disclose and often they're telling me this is the first time they ever did this.
2368200	2372200	So you get a full portion of that every time you show the movie.
2372200	2390200	Yeah, yeah. It's been, it's, I'm glad the movie's helping people. I'm glad it's been doing so well and people are receiving it, but you know, it's, it's, you know, the birth of the movie, and I'll talk about it here because the last time we worked together was, was here.
2390200	2403200	You know, you know, Robin Williams is my best friend and he, he knew, I wanted to do Barry's story all the way in the mid nineties. I thought, you know, we took a swipe at scripts and everything because I thought I'd want to have someone play him.
2403200	2417200	And it was Robin that's kind of suggested that I jettison that idea. I'm smiling because he was like, he's like, I'm too old to play that role anymore. He's like, he said, why don't you do it as a documentary? So, so.
2417200	2427200	Last time we talked about this was Tasha's, your daughter's birthday. And you sat down and said, how are you doing? He said, well, I had a breakup. My best friend died and I'm making a movie about child rape.
2427200	2443200	Child rape. Yeah, it was, it was even better than that. It was divorce, broke up, decorating the Christmas tree with another woman. My best friend passed away. And then yeah, for about eight to 12 hours a day, I would edit a child rape documentary.
2443200	2462200	So it was, I'm really ready to do like a talking duck movie. Just something really acid. Well, that's, I mean, here comes crackers. They were letting you shoot babies before, but now you're like, do you feel like there's like, you get the karma holsters off the leg full and you could like, you could shoot 11 babies.
2462200	2479200	Well, yeah. And everyone was like, at least there wasn't like that doc. So, but Barry wants to do a sequel. He called it, call me greedy. But so Robin was the one he said, you know, shoot as a doc. And he said, I don't have any money. And he actually gave me some money to start filming.
2479200	2491200	And that's how the whole movie got made was that you wanted him to do a live action version of him as Barry. Yeah. Yeah. That was really what I was thinking. And then, and then, and then we still were thinking about making it with someone else playing.
2491200	2507200	And Barry wrote a script that was about 350 pages long. And, and then I took a stab at a script, which actually helped the doc because I kind of had the structure in my head. And I didn't do that as a bait and switch how, how, how his disclosures reveal.
2507200	2520200	I just wanted the audience to feel exactly how I felt, knowing this guy, knowing this guy really well. And, and then learning. Oh, now it makes sense. You know, I think the 48 hours version would have been.
2521200	2538200	Raped at four comedian. And then nothing would have been funny for 45 minutes. Well, it's also like, like, like, like, I want to, I want to bring our other friend up. But I like that. That's the other powerful thing about it. Maybe this is what I was trying to articulate is the, is the fact that you do it that way.
2539200	2567200	It's an, because I feel like sickness, abuse, death, like the things that we fear, the things that we know that are the worst things that can happen to us, we tend to relate to them emotionally as diseases. And when our friends are afflicted with them, like we, we have this temptation to, like, we, it's, it's this, it's this terrible syndrome of shame and guilt and, and, and stuff that we, we go like,
2567200	2585200	Oh God, that well, this person, if this terrible thing happened to them, then, then that makes them a different kind of action figure. They need, they need special tools and backpacks and things. And they're not, it's like, but the, the, nobody is more human and more dimensionalized than Barry Clements.
2586200	2591200	Nobody has more tools to deal with any Manticore that would cross his path.
2594200	2607200	And then, and then this, this, this thing is placed in his path and we watch him eat it and watch him digest it. And we do it with him and that's, it humanizes it and it makes it a real thing, which is really,
2608200	2627200	I often wonder because if Barry, if, because he, he almost, in my mind may have been that kid at four because, because his friends were talking about some preschool revolt that he led, you know, he, they handed out books and then he threw them out the window.
2628200	2643200	They're like, we're not going to need books. So, you know, he said that when I, when he disclosed to me that my reaction wasn't, you know, someone says this to you, now it's on your lap, you know, you're re seeing this person.
2643200	2658200	And when it found, and when he told me, I was just, he said that it was almost if, you know, I, he talks very affectionately about how I reacted. I was just like, oh, you know, I was kind of not happy, but I was just like, oh, well, that makes sense.
2659200	2668200	Where did you first see him or hear him? Like, do you have any favorite jokes? Like the first jokes that like you, like, you remember like when you, when you first thought he was funny?
2668200	2682200	Oh yeah. I mean, the first time I saw him, you know, he was just the first thing I remember was just the first time I saw him walk on stage. He's, he's swilling a beer that he pulled out of his jacket and he's smoking and he's like, I'm on a health kick lately.
2682200	2697200	We've kept one of our other dear friends, a pent up in there who's like you has been, has been out in the world and we want to hear what he's been up to. Let's bring Curtis Armstrong out.
2709200	2710200	What a pleasure.
2712200	2715200	Thank you. Thank you.
2716200	2717200	Hey, buddy.
2718200	2733200	I have these, I have these friendships that I only, that literally only exist on stage and it's very unhealthy. Like, it's a very, like, like, like, but yeah, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just explaining that I'm not a healthy person and that, that, like, that's what I was talking about earlier.
2733200	2749200	Well, that, that, that goes without saying, but what was interesting for me is that I, you know, was, I'm here because I've been away for a while and I, I asked if I could come by and he said, yeah, but of course he doesn't tell me.
2750200	2751200	Oh, that I'm here?
2751200	2758200	That you're here. So I show up just as you come out and it's the first time I think I've been in a room with him in about 30 years.
2758200	2760200	Oh, I didn't know you guys crossed paths.
2760200	2762200	We did a little, we did a movie called One Crazy Summer.
2762200	2763200	Oh, yeah.
2764200	2765200	She's just fucking crying.
2766200	2767200	She's my brain.
2767200	2769200	That was rotting away.
2769200	2770200	We keep missing each other.
2770200	2771200	That was Joel Murray, too, right?
2771200	2772200	Joel Murray, yeah, who was the guy.
2772200	2773200	Joel Murray, right.
2773200	2775200	God bless America, whom we love and adore.
2775200	2776200	John Cusack.
2777200	2779200	Why did they not make that fucking connection?
2779200	2781200	Well, that's how we met.
2781200	2794200	We were, we were in our 20s and we made that movie and it was, I, I'm a big indoor BB gun enthusiast, but at the time, at the time we made that movie, I was a big indoor model rocketry enthusiast.
2794200	2795200	Yes.
2795200	2801200	So every night I'd go back into my room and build a big rocket and then shoot it down the hallway at the hotel.
2801200	2805200	Because there was this security guard who was like, you guys are making too much noise.
2805200	2807200	And I was like, oh, I'll give you noise.
2807200	2816200	So we would sit there at lawn chairs for this poor guy to come around the corner and go, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
2816200	2818200	Just rocket at him.
2818200	2820200	Yeah, that was a lot of stuff like that when we made that movie.
2820200	2821200	It was great.
2821200	2826200	And what was really great about that movie is if you see it now, there's Bill Murray, there's Joel.
2826200	2827200	Joel Murray, Joel.
2827200	2828200	Joel Murray.
2828200	2829200	Now I feel better.
2829200	2834200	Joel Murray and, and Bill and John Cusack and Demi Moore.
2834200	2835200	Demi Moore.
2835200	2843200	And what's really funny about it is he so completely took over this movie.
2843200	2844200	Wow.
2844200	2845200	No, wait, finish.
2845200	2846200	Let me finish what I'm saying.
2846200	2857200	So what happens is we all show up and we all think that we have our thing going and we know what we're doing and we have our bit.
2857200	2861200	And, you know, Cusack's got a name already and Demi's got a name already.
2861200	2869200	But after about a week on the set, they're all talking like him on camera.
2869200	2875200	Not just off camera where we're off going, you know, but on camera.
2875200	2879200	And it started like with Cusack doing it.
2879200	2881200	Remember this?
2881200	2882200	Yeah, he did a little bit.
2882200	2885200	And Joel and then Demi started doing it.
2885200	2889200	So they would be on camera doing scenes that had nothing to do with him.
2889200	2893200	And Savage Steve is like, you know, this wasn't supposed to be about Grover's family.
2893200	2898200	That's right.
2898200	2901200	So Demi was on General Hospital.
2901200	2905200	Cusack had done that Rob Reiner movie, A Sure Thing.
2905200	2908200	Everybody was coming up.
2908200	2910200	Everybody had a Haikyuu.
2910200	2915200	But Curtis, so we'd all got the dinner and nobody would recognize anybody.
2915200	2919200	And they'd always be, Booger! It's fucking Booger!
2919200	2923200	Booger! Booger, come over here!
2923200	2928200	Occasionally they'd be, Jackie Templeton, which was Demi's character on that movie.
2928200	2931200	No, it was great. It was such a great scene.
2931200	2932200	I can't believe you.
2932200	2938200	There's a scene where Steve told me later, that scene where it's with you and I.
2938200	2941200	And I say, talk about a little fat kid who was growing up.
2941200	2942200	Yes, oh God, yes.
2942200	2947200	And he goes, were you that fat kid? And I was like, no, I used to punch the shit out of him.
2947200	2949200	And I'm almost in tears telling that story.
2949200	2953200	But I didn't remember. Steve said that that was something I pitched.
2953200	2956200	You didn't pitch it. I'll tell you exactly what happened.
2956200	2962200	I'm gonna fucking die over here. I'm so happy.
2962200	2967200	I have never forgotten this because I honestly didn't know Bobcat at that point.
2967200	2973200	He was just this godlike thing that showed up on the set one day.
2973200	2976200	And you couldn't stop, you couldn't speak.
2976200	2979200	You weren't familiar with anything that you hadn't seen him.
2979200	2982200	I don't know if I'd seen him. I'd never seen him live.
2982200	2984200	So I don't think, I saw him live a lot after.
2984200	2986200	But at that time I hadn't seen him.
2986200	2990200	So, but he shows up and there's just nobody like this man in the world.
2990200	2995200	And it wasn't like he was on in that sort of Bobcat character all the time.
2995200	3001200	He wasn't doing that. But he was so interesting and so funny and so smart.
3001200	3003200	And everything, all this great stuff was coming out of him.
3003200	3006200	And you just wanted to sit and listen to him.
3006200	3011200	And so we're at lunch one day. He comes over to me and says, come here.
3011200	3014200	And he takes me into a garage.
3019200	3021200	I'm not falling for that again.
3022200	3028200	And he says, I have this idea for a scene.
3028200	3031200	And I want to run through it with you before I show Savage.
3031200	3033200	This is what happened.
3033200	3037200	So we sit down and I'm just looking at you waiting for you to start.
3037200	3043200	And you start in on that speech where you say, you know, there was this little fat kid once.
3043200	3048200	And you go through the whole thing and it's very funny if you know the movie and if you see the movie.
3048200	3050200	He's really funny.
3050200	3056200	And he tells this whole sad story about the little fat boy like he's confessing.
3056200	3063200	And I say, and I just said to him as a person, were you that little fat boy?
3065200	3069200	And he said, nobody used to beat the shit out of him.
3069200	3072200	And I thought it was the best thing I'd ever seen.
3072200	3077200	So we got Savage from lunch and we ran through it again for Savage.
3077200	3080200	And it's the big scene that he has in the movie.
3080200	3082200	And he just came up with it.
3082200	3086200	But I didn't. Yeah, I was naive about how things work.
3087200	3088200	Apparently not.
3088200	3089200	Yeah.
3089200	3090200	Apparently you could just put a scene in a movie.
3090200	3091200	Well, I wouldn't.
3091200	3092200	Yeah, I know.
3092200	3093200	You were right.
3093200	3098200	When you had me during community, I didn't do any of that shit.
3098200	3102200	You didn't come down and go, what the fuck is going on?
3102200	3105200	Goldwaite's in a scene now?
3105200	3106200	All right.
3106200	3110200	So for real, Curtis, that whole scene, that monologue is all at risk.
3110200	3113200	Improvised entirely by him in a garage.
3113200	3115200	Because that's one of the memorable...
3115200	3116200	I know.
3116200	3117200	That's why I'm bringing it up.
3117200	3118200	It's one of the big scenes in the movie.
3118200	3119200	I do remember it.
3119200	3122200	And I have the best memory in the world.
3123200	3126200	Because I forgot that they were in that movie together.
3126200	3131200	I mean, I get to travel around a lot with Joel Murray and whom I love and adore,
3131200	3134200	who's one of the most delightful people there is.
3134200	3137200	And he's told stories about working on One Crazy Summer
3137200	3139200	about how much fun you guys had.
3139200	3140200	Yeah, it really was fun.
3140200	3143200	Like all the partying, because it was the 80s and it was groove-tastic.
3143200	3144200	It was insane.
3144200	3146200	And it was like really sexy and fun.
3146200	3147200	I remember the...
3147200	3152200	Q's like, I got this friend and he's going to put him in the movie and it was Piven.
3152200	3157200	And Piven shows up, gets hammered, jumps in the pool, cracks his face open on the bottom of the pool.
3157200	3159200	It hasn't been on camera yet.
3159200	3162200	And they had a putty in his face with mortician's wax.
3162200	3163200	That's right.
3163200	3165200	He had a big cut in his head.
3165200	3166200	Aw, Pivvy.
3166200	3167200	Aw, the Piv.
3167200	3168200	A little Pivvy.
3168200	3169200	Poor Pivvy.
3169200	3171200	Mr. Sulfridge.
3174200	3176200	Okay, enough One Crazy Summer.
3176200	3180200	But that must have been an awesome time to be young comics in...
3180200	3181200	Yeah.
3181200	3184200	When they were making big comedy films like...
3184200	3185200	Well, I remember that...
3185200	3187200	The name of it was called...
3187200	3189200	What was it? My Summer Vacation or Greedy?
3189200	3190200	My Summer Vacation.
3190200	3191200	Yeah, yeah.
3191200	3192200	They were saying...
3192200	3195200	Warner Brothers said, you can't call that because they had vacation.
3195200	3199200	And so they said, we're going to call it One Crazy Summer.
3199200	3203200	And he goes, if they put out Woody Allen movies, it'd be One Neurotic Jewish Guy.
3206200	3207200	Yeah, that's what...
3207200	3213200	I mean, well, to counter what Jeff said, I think the further back you go,
3213200	3217200	and we think in this desolate landscape of where it's catch-as-catch-can
3217200	3222200	and we just get a little giggled here and my podcast got 600 hits and I'm so happy.
3222200	3227200	And I think you talk to the Fairly Brothers about Kingpin, for example,
3227200	3232200	and you hear this story about how they almost killed themselves.
3232200	3236200	I thought Kingpin was the best Fairly Brothers movie that has ever been made,
3236200	3239200	but because the world was older than...
3239200	3241200	Like, the rules are different about...
3241200	3245200	Who's telling you what about whether or not you're being successful?
3245200	3247200	Whether or not your movie succeeded.
3247200	3252200	And the disparity between when you're supposed to celebrate...
3252200	3256200	Remember when the Sony leaks came out and it was just like...
3256200	3260200	One of the most delightful parts of the Sony leaks was Channing Tatum's email
3260200	3264200	to everybody at Sony going, yeah, bitches, we did it!
3266200	3270200	Because they just made like $740 billion in an hour for...
3270200	3271200	I don't even know which movie it was.
3271200	3274200	Godzilla vs. Men in Black or whatever, I don't know.
3274200	3276200	It doesn't matter.
3276200	3280200	But Channing Tatum was involved and he was like, yeah, bitches!
3280200	3282200	He was using Zs and exclamation points.
3282200	3285200	There's got to be a high-five emoticon.
3285200	3288200	But it really has nothing to do with whether or not...
3288200	3291200	I'm not saying whatever he was talking about was a bad movie.
3291200	3295200	I'm saying it was completely disconnected from whether it was a good or bad movie.
3295200	3300200	Because Jeff is saying, oh, that must have been a great time to be alive,
3300200	3301200	all these comedy movies.
3301200	3303200	I'm going to assume, God, no.
3303200	3310200	I'm assuming that just meant that more hilarious people were being told more times per minute.
3310200	3311200	You really fucked up.
3311200	3313200	I can't believe you were in that piece of shit.
3313200	3315200	But you told me to be in it!
3315200	3317200	That was a piece of shit, I never said that.
3317200	3319200	Why would I do that?
3319200	3321200	I worked for Mike Ovitz, God damn it.
3321200	3322200	I was recently...
3322200	3326200	I just did coke off of the small world ride.
3332200	3337200	I was in a Talking Horse movie that put me in comedy jail.
3337200	3339200	And in my career.
3339200	3340200	Comedy jail.
3340200	3341200	And I look at the...
3341200	3344200	I was just recently moving and I found the script.
3344200	3347200	And I scribbled on it and sent it back to my manager.
3347200	3349200	I go, why would I do this?
3349200	3352200	And then he had written a dollar sign on it.
3355200	3357200	I'm shameful telling this.
3357200	3359200	Well, they're the opposite of therapists.
3359200	3364200	The agents tell you that you should worry about everything and money matters.
3364200	3369200	And then you go to therapy and it's like, no.
3369200	3371200	It's true.
3371200	3376200	I just make my movies so far out of the system.
3376200	3379200	And I love working on community.
3379200	3383200	I love working on people's shows that I respect and have fun.
3383200	3384200	And that's great.
3384200	3386200	And then I go make these movies.
3386200	3389200	And I don't mean to throw my agent under the bus.
3389200	3391200	I'm not going to be specific.
3391200	3392200	One of my agents.
3392200	3394200	That way I can get him off the hook.
3396200	3399200	He called me up and he said...
3399200	3400200	Because it was in the trades.
3400200	3403200	And he goes, hey, Sundance.
3403200	3405200	And I go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3405200	3407200	You made another movie.
3409200	3411200	It's an actual quote.
3411200	3413200	I was like...
3414200	3417200	He wasn't along to the right...
3417200	3421200	I just go do them and let them catch up, you know?
3421200	3422200	Wow.
3422200	3423200	I don't know.
3423200	3425200	What's your agency?
3425200	3427200	Is that a personal question?
3427200	3431200	At this point, I was just wondering if you're UTA or not.
3431200	3433200	But I was a...
3433200	3434200	I didn't...
3434200	3436200	This is an age thing.
3436200	3438200	And I think I regard it as like...
3438200	3440200	Oh, I guess I made it.
3440200	3443200	I'm a character in a movie about people that make things because...
3443200	3447200	I had a meeting at my agency and I went to the wrong building.
3447200	3450200	They had moved four years ago.
3450200	3452200	Because I don't...
3452200	3453200	I'm an autopilot.
3453200	3457200	Somebody goes, what's that dumb fuck doing?
3457200	3459200	If they want to be in business with a dumb fuck, they...
3459200	3463200	Do they ever send you things for you to...
3463200	3464200	You know what I mean?
3464200	3465200	That you didn't create?
3465200	3466200	Yeah.
3466200	3468200	Especially now that I'm trying to do this studio thing.
3468200	3472200	I'm trying to become a suit because I'm a fucking horrible self-destructive person.
3472200	3474200	And really insecure.
3474200	3476200	But I'm trying to...
3476200	3479200	Because I get scripts, which is new for me.
3479200	3480200	And then...
3480200	3482200	I should just read my emails.
3482200	3484200	This is a very well-written script.
3484200	3488200	And I hate everyone who wrote it.
3488200	3494200	If I ever see them, I'm going to punch them all in the throat.
3494200	3495200	It's a pass.
3495200	3497200	And then I wrote, P.S.
3497200	3499200	If this email does get hacked by the North Koreans,
3499200	3503200	I'm a really big fan of their irreverent brand of humor.
3503200	3506200	And I wish them more continued success.
3506200	3507200	Yeah.
3507200	3509200	I mean, I think at a certain point, don't you...
3509200	3511200	Because I think...
3511200	3516200	It's that movie archetype of your agent should just have the pork pie hat.
3516200	3519200	He's just like a really old guy that's just like...
3519200	3521200	You can't leave him now.
3521200	3523200	And he's just like, I'll tell him what they call you.
3523200	3524200	You know the Bobcat deal.
3524200	3527200	The Bobcat deal is a million prescriptions.
3527200	3528200	You're just kind of like...
3528200	3533200	Well, at a certain point, you're just out there,
3533200	3536200	like a log floating on a lake.
3536200	3541200	The importance of representation becomes slightly diminished.
3541200	3547200	Well, it certainly doesn't help in the types of movies I'm trying to make.
3547200	3550200	So I just don't waste their time with that stuff.
3550200	3551200	Right.
3551200	3552200	I don't resent them.
3552200	3554200	And they'll probably try to talk you out of it.
3554200	3556200	Hey Bob, are you still doing the kinks thing or can we talk about that?
3556200	3557200	Yeah.
3557200	3560200	I mean, that's my dream project is that I wrote a screenplay
3560200	3562200	based on Schoolboys in Disgrace.
3562200	3566200	And Ray Davis has been very involved and encouraging.
3566200	3568200	That's one I hope you make.
3568200	3569200	I hope so too.
3569200	3574200	Well, you know, it's frustrating because it's, you know...
3574200	3576200	Dudes in a high school basically singing.
3576200	3579200	It seems like that formula has worked before.
3579200	3582200	I don't know why people are really so skittish around it,
3582200	3583200	but I don't know.
3583200	3586200	It's not like I'm coming to them with, you know...
3586200	3587200	What's your relationship?
3587200	3589200	It's like, hey, did he do a musical?
3589200	3594200	No, but he did that baby rape doc and he did a Bigfoot movie.
3594200	3595200	He's your man.
3595200	3596200	He's your man.
3596200	3599200	Of course he should do a musical.
3599200	3600200	I don't know what's going to go next.
3600200	3603200	I also wrote this gay Billy Jack movie, which is...
3603200	3604200	Gay Billy Jack?
3604200	3605200	Well, he's not like...
3605200	3608200	I just watched Billy Jack again a couple of days ago, like two days ago.
3608200	3610200	Cried at the end because when...
3610200	3612200	Tinsel just starts playing at the end of that.
3612200	3613200	You return to Billy Jack.
3613200	3615200	Well, the first one.
3615200	3617200	Well, there's born losers.
3617200	3619200	I'm a big Billy Jack fan.
3619200	3622200	If you guys have not seen Billy Jack, it's a great...
3622200	3625200	It's all that's great about the 70s.
3625200	3627200	But he kicks ass.
3627200	3630200	It's left to be politics, but really violent.
3630200	3635200	It's about civil rights and it's about anti-establishmentism,
3635200	3639200	Arianism, and not Arianism.
3639200	3640200	It's not about Arianism.
3640200	3641200	Yeah, you lost me.
3641200	3647200	Anti-establishmentism, Arianism, and a little bit of Nazis.
3647200	3652200	In the 70s, there had to be Kung Fu and Karate at all times.
3652200	3654200	It's so fucking good.
3654200	3657200	It's progressive politics with violence.
3657200	3659200	It's such a beautiful mixture.
3659200	3662200	I'm really proud of Jeff for resisting the urge
3662200	3664200	because what he really wants to do, because I know he knows it by heart,
3664200	3666200	he wants to do the Billy Jack.
3666200	3667200	The speech?
3667200	3668200	The Billy Jack of my life.
3668200	3669200	You know, Bernard.
3669200	3672200	You know, Bernard.
3672200	3676200	When Jill and the kids up at the school tell me not to be violent
3676200	3679200	and to be non-violent, I try.
3679200	3681200	I really try.
3681200	3682200	I'll do the whole thing.
3682200	3683200	No, keep going.
3683200	3684200	Come on, just do it.
3684200	3685200	Oh, no, no, come on.
3685200	3687200	That's just the truth.
3687200	3689200	Do it.
3689200	3690200	You can't stop now.
3690200	3691200	Bobcat, you know what I'm talking about?
3691200	3692200	The ice cream shop scene.
3692200	3693200	Of course.
3693200	3694200	But when I see...
3694200	3696200	When I see what you did with this flower...
3696200	3697200	When I see this girl...
3697200	3698200	You know what we call her back at the...
3698200	3701200	We call her God's little gift of sunshine.
3701200	3704200	And when I see this boy so degraded,
3704200	3707200	and when I think of a number of years,
3707200	3711200	he's going to have to live in his memory
3711200	3718200	this idiotic moment of yours.
3718200	3721200	I just go berserk.
3722200	3724200	Now, I'm not Jeff's agent,
3724200	3727200	and he's not auditioning for gay Billy Jack, but...
3727200	3729200	Yeah, so...
3729200	3734200	Please, everybody, YouTube, that fucking scene is so good.
3734200	3739200	So, my ex-wife, I said to her, I was like,
3739200	3742200	dude, I can't do this anymore.
3742200	3745200	I'm so tired of being broke.
3745200	3748200	I'm going to write a genre picture.
3748200	3750200	And I go, I love Billy Jack.
3750200	3751200	I'm going to write a genre picture.
3751200	3752200	I'm going to write a Billy Jack movie.
3752200	3755200	So, I'm down there writing and...
3755200	3756200	She goes, how's it going?
3756200	3758200	I go, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
3758200	3759200	She goes, how long are you?
3759200	3761200	And I go, about 50 pages.
3761200	3765200	He's gay now.
3765200	3771200	And she goes, so we're just going to keep renting, huh?
3771200	3774200	Go ahead and hate your neighbor.
3774200	3775200	Go ahead and cheat.
3775200	3777200	That's the whole thing.
3777200	3779200	He goes into this town, he's trying to drink his whiskey,
3779200	3781200	and someone calls him fag, and he says,
3781200	3784200	I'm going to have to ask you to stop using that word.
3784200	3786200	Yes.
3786200	3787200	Bobcat?
3787200	3788200	And he's like, what are you going to do about it?
3788200	3789200	Fag.
3789200	3791200	He goes, well, I'm going to dislocate his shoulder.
3791200	3793200	I'm going to fracture his kneecap.
3793200	3794200	I'm going to shatter...
3794200	3796200	I fucked up.
3796200	3798200	And he goes, I'm going to shatter your windpipe.
3798200	3799200	And you want to know something?
3799200	3800200	That's not a goddamn thing you do.
3800200	3804200	That's not a goddamn thing you do about it.
3804200	3807200	And then in the script it says,
3807200	3809200	it's the simplest direction I've ever written.
3809200	3813200	It just says, and he does.
3813200	3818200	So then he walks back over to the bartender,
3818200	3821200	and he finally finishes his whiskey, and he throws it down.
3821200	3824200	He says, is there a decent place for a man to stay in this town?
3824200	3832200	And then it smash cuts to him waking up in bed with the bartender.
3833200	3835200	But I've got to say, this scene sounds funny.
3835200	3837200	Make this movie.
3837200	3839200	Jeff!
3839200	3841200	If I'm not a fucking Billy Jack...
3841200	3845200	I know this sounds like it's a joke,
3845200	3851200	but I really do kind of explore all this stuff about what's it like being a gay man
3851200	3855200	and what defines sexuality.
3855200	3856200	What the fuck is wrong with me?
3856200	3857200	I'm so uncommercial.
3857200	3859200	I have no idea.
3859200	3861200	Well, yeah, I don't think you have to tell you.
3861200	3865200	Yeah, I would assume when you told me that you weren't like,
3865200	3868200	this is hilarious, these faggots are going to hate this.
3868200	3870200	Right, right. Exactly.
3870200	3873200	I'm finally letting them have it, see?
3873200	3876200	In a studio picture it would have been like, hello!
3876200	3878200	Oh God, Boat Trip?
3878200	3879200	Boat Trip.
3879200	3882200	Boat Trip is like a goddamn fucking psychedelic,
3882200	3886200	ayahuasca spirit vision.
3886200	3888200	Boat Trip is one of the most amazing...
3888200	3889200	I don't know.
3889200	3891200	If you've not seen Boat Trip,
3891200	3897200	Cuba Gooding Jr. and a series of other culprits make a movie.
3897200	3900200	It's two guys...
3900200	3906200	I think what happened is somebody was getting fired
3906200	3909200	at one of the oldest agencies in the world
3909200	3912200	and their fingers locked on their filing cabinet,
3912200	3916200	which tipped over so there was finally the script visible underneath it
3916200	3920200	and the cleaning lady at the...
3920200	3923200	or cleaning man at the agency.
3923200	3925200	Or, you know, cleaning person.
3925200	3927200	Nice save, nice save.
3927200	3931200	They put it on top of the pile so the bottom was like this Brazil thing
3931200	3933200	and the movie got green lit.
3933200	3936200	Are you sure this is the movie that was supposed to be green lit?
3936200	3939200	Two guys, it was on the top of the deck.
3939200	3943200	They go on a boat and then they find out that it's a gay boat.
3943200	3945200	We're on a gay boat.
3945200	3948200	And then they have to pretend to be gay or they got kicked off the boat
3948200	3951200	and the gay guys get to look at six tits if they want
3951200	3953200	because six don't care if gay guys look at their tits.
3953200	3956200	Those aren't some real high stakes.
3956200	3958200	The movie is like...
3958200	3963200	The movie includes Cuba Gooding Jr. coming out of a porthole
3963200	3965200	into the open air...
3965200	3966200	It's his Oscar.
3966200	3969200	And his cum splatters on someone's face.
3969200	3974200	He had won an Oscar like 30 seconds before this movie was made.
3974200	3976200	And then there were like nine movies.
3976200	3979200	Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar and then had nine movies
3979200	3982200	with talking dogs and gay jokes in them.
3982200	3984200	What does the cum land on?
3984200	3985200	The cum goes out the porthole.
3985200	3987200	The cum just lands on a person.
3987200	3989200	And then you go like, oh, what about something about me?
3989200	3991200	See, in one crazy summer, that was a chili dog.
3991200	3992200	That's right.
3992200	3994200	And it landed on my friend Tony V.
3994200	3996200	And his famous line was, you kids?
3996200	3998200	Yeah, that's right.
3998200	4000200	Tony V?
4000200	4003200	Here's one of the weirdest things to look for in Boat Trip
4003200	4006200	when you rent it tonight, kids.
4006200	4009200	I'd like to mention that all my movies are available
4009200	4012200	on digital platforms.
4012200	4014200	You don't necessarily have to watch Boat Trip.
4014200	4015200	But you'll only be encouraging him.
4015200	4017200	He's a documentary filmmaker now.
4017200	4020200	Watch him after Boat Trip.
4020200	4021200	Watch Boat Trip first.
4021200	4025200	Don't encourage his faze of like, I hate America.
4025200	4026200	I'm going to tour.
4026200	4028200	I hate America.
4028200	4031200	I'm going to go to France.
4032200	4036200	There's a scene in Boat Trip where Kuma Gooding Jr.,
4036200	4039200	who is in love with the woman who thinks that he's gay,
4039200	4042200	because that's what he has had to do to survive on the boat,
4042200	4045200	the gay man, which affords him the ironic chance
4045200	4047200	to be in close quarters with her.
4047200	4050200	She's confiding with him about her single life
4050200	4052200	and how she wishes she could find a man.
4052200	4055200	And if he just keeps lisping enough,
4055200	4057200	then he gets to be with her.
4057200	4059200	And so it's very uncomfortable for him.
4059200	4065200	And at one point, the topic of conversation somehow comes to,
4065200	4069200	it either comes to how are you supposed to eat a banana
4069200	4070200	or how are you supposed to suck a dick.
4070200	4072200	But in any case, she picks up a banana,
4072200	4076200	peels the banana to show him how she sucks dick.
4076200	4079200	And so the joke is that he's going like,
4079200	4081200	ha, ha, I can't believe it.
4081200	4086200	Oh, she's sucking a banana dick in front of me.
4087200	4091200	The crazy thing, the crazy thing about it,
4091200	4094200	if you watch the movie in high def,
4097200	4101200	you can see his credibility leave the back of his head
4101200	4104200	of her licking the tip of the banana.
4104200	4106200	It's unmistakable.
4106200	4109200	The prop master, for some reason,
4109200	4112200	has like, well, not for some reason,
4112200	4116200	but for some disconnect between industry and government
4116200	4118200	and society.
4118200	4121200	The prop master has taken like a tool
4121200	4126200	and shaped like a visible penis head
4126200	4129200	into the tip of the banana.
4129200	4133200	And I love all prop masters that have ever worked with me.
4133200	4134200	You're the fucking best.
4134200	4135200	You're wizards.
4135200	4136200	You collaborate well.
4136200	4138200	I have respect for your craft.
4138200	4140200	But this is exactly the kind of thing that, you know,
4140200	4144200	if you were to take a late lunch,
4144200	4146200	you might find out that someone was like, yeah,
4146200	4149200	well, then it says in the script, it's like a dick.
4149200	4151200	So what do I do?
4151200	4153200	I fucking I'm going to get a raise today.
4153200	4155200	I'm going to make it like a dick.
4155200	4157200	And then you go, why are you making a banana like a dick?
4157200	4158200	That makes no sense.
4158200	4161200	That's so sense.
4161200	4163200	But it's like everyone on the set must have been like,
4163200	4165200	it looks like a dick.
4165200	4168200	Johnny, Johnny, get back to the set.
4168200	4171200	We're making a hit.
4171200	4174200	The banana.
4174200	4176200	The banana looks like a dick.
4176200	4177200	Get back here.
4177200	4181200	And Universal and Fox and Rupert Murdoch.
4181200	4183200	And she's like, oh, it looks like a dick.
4183200	4184200	And she's like licking it.
4184200	4185200	It looks like a dick.
4185200	4188200	They carved a dick out of a banana.
4188200	4190200	But it's so insane.
4190200	4195200	Do you think somebody just looked at the banana and was like,
4195200	4197200	I don't know if this reads like a dick.
4197200	4200200	It doesn't.
4200200	4201200	It could have just been one voice.
4201200	4202200	Do you think it was a studio note?
4202200	4203200	I don't know.
4203200	4205200	It's like, I hate bananas like that.
4205200	4206200	And I'm kind of horny.
4206200	4207200	Can we make it?
4207200	4208200	Can she be?
4208200	4211200	I feel like the banana doesn't read as a cock.
4211200	4214200	Can she be holding some kiwis?
4214200	4215200	Yeah.
4215200	4217200	It's the same guy who kept saying, I'm telling you,
4217200	4220200	this should be called gay boat trip.
4220200	4224200	I don't know why you're PC-ing the title.
4224200	4226200	It should be called gay boat trip.
4226200	4228200	We did tests on the title.
4228200	4230200	People don't care about boats.
4230200	4231200	We said gay boat trip.
4231200	4233200	They know the movie we're talking about.
4233200	4236200	It's Kuba Gooding Jr. and Carlos.
4236200	4237200	Carlos?
4237200	4238200	Who is it?
4238200	4239200	Carlos?
4239200	4240200	No, no, no, no.
4240200	4242200	It was Horatio Sands.
4242200	4244200	Horatio Sands.
4244200	4245200	Whom we loving it for.
4245200	4250200	I don't think everybody has to go home and watch it.
4250200	4251200	They already did.
4251200	4254200	Have you gone off on a boat trip rant before?
4254200	4255200	No.
4255200	4256200	I don't think so.
4256200	4257200	It's possible.
4257200	4258200	It's possible.
4258200	4259200	I mean, it's not busting your chops.
4259200	4262200	I didn't know if that was like what frosted your cake.
4262200	4263200	You know what I mean?
4263200	4267200	Like it's like, if I see that boat trip one more time.
4267200	4268200	No, I mean, I just.
4268200	4270200	I'm going to come so hard.
4270200	4273200	What frosted my cake is inscrutability.
4273200	4279200	Like when you look into it, you can't find even the most coarse,
4279200	4282200	crass, cynical explanation for it.
4282200	4283200	Yeah.
4283200	4286200	But I think movies like that make it like, you know, like I did
4286200	4287200	Sleeping Dogs Lie.
4287200	4288200	It was called Stay, originally.
4288200	4291200	But it's a rom-com.
4291200	4292200	Not a rom-com.
4292200	4295200	It's kind of a little bit more my stab at trying to do a Woody Allen movie.
4295200	4298200	But with a tiny bit of bestiality in it.
4298200	4300200	Just a little bit of bestiality.
4300200	4301200	Just a hint?
4301200	4302200	Yeah.
4302200	4303200	Just a whisper of bestiality.
4303200	4304200	That's a backstory.
4304200	4305200	That's just so.
4305200	4306200	But I think when people.
4306200	4307200	That's just so.
4307200	4308200	That's just so.
4308200	4312200	But I think when people hear about it, they think that's what they're
4312200	4313200	going to see.
4313200	4316200	You know, an actual shot of her spitting dog semen out and all this stuff.
4316200	4320200	You know, and the joke isn't like making fun of her character.
4320200	4325200	It's actually about, you know, how there's things in our past that other
4325200	4326200	people can't get past.
4326200	4328200	And she learns in that movie at the end.
4328200	4331200	She says, you know, I learned it's the living up to the lies that we tell
4331200	4333200	about ourselves that make us better people.
4333200	4334200	Yeah.
4334200	4337200	By the way, they made the same movie with an avalanche.
4337200	4340200	And everyone's like, now I accept it.
4340200	4341200	Yeah.
4341200	4345200	And they're like, in your movie, she fucks a dog.
4345200	4346200	Yeah.
4346200	4347200	But yeah.
4347200	4348200	But it's all off camera.
4348200	4350200	And it's, I remember getting this note.
4350200	4351200	Oh, the avalanche never kills him.
4351200	4354200	I got a note that was.
4354200	4359200	Could she just jerk the dog off?
4359200	4361200	Swear to God.
4361200	4364200	I was like, what the fuck?
4364200	4366200	Which is actually weirder, right?
4366200	4367200	Yeah.
4367200	4369200	Then you'd be like looking at the dog.
4369200	4373200	Like, why would you?
4373200	4374200	You're invested in the.
4374200	4376200	The doc doesn't need that.
4376200	4377200	That's just about.
4377200	4378200	Yeah.
4378200	4381200	You know, she says it's like something weird, you know, that's like touching
4381200	4382200	a toaster that, you know, is hot.
4382200	4385200	It was, you know, she's not in the bestiality.
4385200	4386200	It was just this weird thing.
4386200	4388200	It's about something that happened in the course of life.
4388200	4389200	Yeah.
4389200	4390200	And I needed something that people couldn't get past.
4390200	4393200	And jerking off a dog can only happen as the result of planting.
4393200	4396200	Plus if you told somebody else, it's like, you know, once I jerked off a
4396200	4398200	dog, you go, yeah, that's fucking weird.
4399200	4401200	You went like 40 percent of the people do.
4401200	4402200	I did, too.
4402200	4404200	I in a barn on a bed.
4404200	4405200	That's what it is.
4405200	4408200	So and that, by the way, when that movie came out.
4408200	4409200	Oh, my God.
4409200	4410200	People would be like that.
4410200	4413200	You know, the point of that movie was, you know, it's OK to lie.
4413200	4414200	And right.
4414200	4419200	And because sometimes people tell the truth and they're not being kind.
4419200	4424200	And but man, as soon as that movie, like the lights go up, people go.
4424200	4425200	I'll tell you what.
4425200	4426200	I go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
4426200	4428200	People just started telling me their bestiality.
4430200	4434200	I don't know if you've ever felt the lamb's mouth.
4434200	4435200	I'm like, whoa.
4438200	4440200	That's not what the movie is about.
4440200	4442200	I tell one more story about this movie.
4442200	4448200	My daughter was 18 or 19 and the movie starts and that's right out of the gate.
4448200	4449200	That scene happens.
4449200	4453200	And there's this woman is at Sundance and people, you know, and it's not me
4453200	4454200	self-loathing.
4454200	4456200	Everything sells out at Sundance.
4456200	4459200	So I knew I was like the third or fourth choice.
4459200	4462200	You know, I mean, it's like, hey, you know, some already farty movie.
4462200	4464200	I got a Bobcat Golding movie ticket.
4464200	4465200	You want it?
4465200	4466200	So it was packed.
4466200	4468200	I was glad people were there, but they did not know what they're going to get.
4468200	4472200	So this scene starts in this woman's like four rows behind us and she's like,
4472200	4476200	she's going to leave and she's gathering up her coat and stuff and her friend
4476200	4481200	talks her into staying and and about 50 minutes into the movie, that same woman
4481200	4483200	was crying watching the movie.
4483200	4485200	And my daughter goes, look at your friend now.
4485200	4487200	And I look at my daughter goes, yeah, you cry, bitch.
4487200	4488200	You cry.
4494200	4495200	For real.
4499200	4500200	Oh, my God.
4500200	4501200	Now I'm terrified.
4501200	4502200	Jeff knows.
4502200	4503200	I'm terrified.
4503200	4506200	Children know because if my child makes me that proud, I would be like,
4506200	4508200	can you marry your daughter?
4508200	4510200	You know, you know what?
4511200	4514200	Your relationship with your daughter is amazing.
4514200	4517200	And Curtis, I've never met your daughter, but you seem to have a great.
4517200	4518200	I have yours, too.
4518200	4519200	I have one of those.
4521200	4526200	But Bob's daughter, Tasha, like she loves you and like she's your best friend.
4526200	4527200	And she like.
4527200	4532200	But and I know and the queen of the ball busting like like like at Sundance
4532200	4536200	this year, she's like, Dad, I have to come over here.
4536200	4537200	I go, what?
4537200	4540200	She goes, I, I want I got you this.
4540200	4541200	It means a lot to me.
4541200	4544200	And I need you to wear this.
4544200	4547200	And it's a it was a police academy to crew jacket.
4550200	4552200	And I fucking wore it.
4553200	4554200	She knew you.
4554200	4555200	She knows you're not in the first one.
4555200	4556200	That's sweet.
4556200	4557200	That's smart. Yeah.
4557200	4558200	Yeah.
4558200	4559200	Yeah.
4559200	4560200	Yeah.
4560200	4561200	Yeah.
4561200	4563200	So that's why I wanted the premier of my series.
4563200	4572200	Tasha is so cool and it's so cool to see like a father that like like I grew up in Los Angeles where most of my friends,
4572200	4576200	they don't have a great relationship with their parents or they hate their brother or they hate their sister.
4576200	4579200	And there's not a lot of great stories of families that love each other.
4579200	4581200	There are plenty, but there's also lots that don't.
4581200	4591200	It's very cool to see like Tasha worships you and also treats you like a buddy because I think you treat her like a buddy.
4591200	4592200	And like that, that's a very rare thing.
4592200	4597200	And Curtis, like I feel like you have the same relationship with her, although I don't know her.
4597200	4598200	It's always.
4598200	4600200	But well, you have to take my word for it.
4600200	4601200	I will.
4601200	4604200	But I mean, I think we take your word for everything because you deal in sincerity.
4604200	4608200	And I don't think you would ever dissemble about something like that.
4608200	4609200	No.
4610200	4614200	That's everything that we like about you two as individuals.
4614200	4619200	The fact that you have a great relationship with your daughter is really remarkable.
4619200	4637200	Well, you know, I have to I have to tell you when I when I met Bob, he was the first the first actor I think I'd worked with in Hollywood whose politics and particularly gender politics mirrored mine.
4637200	4641200	I thought that was so cool because there were not many.
4641200	4642200	Hating women.
4642200	4643200	Yeah, exactly.
4643200	4644200	And no.
4644200	4648200	And and and not because this is like a movie.
4648200	4649200	It's like, you know what?
4649200	4651200	This might be less Jimmy Moore.
4651200	4660200	I just I think more and more I am.
4660200	4661200	No.
4661200	4663200	And I met here and I just assumed, oh, everybody in Hollywood is chill.
4663200	4664200	Yeah.
4664200	4665200	Yeah.
4665200	4666200	One of my first.
4666200	4667200	Yeah.
4667200	4668200	Yeah.
4668200	4669200	I was quite naive about the thing.
4669200	4677200	But so you so we all know each other because because Eric Idol and his wife Tanya and they have a daughter Lily and my daughter grew up with with Lily.
4677200	4679200	I know as as as a friend.
4679200	4685200	So I was on Arsenio Hall when when he got fired.
4685200	4691200	And so I walked out and I spray painted Paramount sucks on the backdrop of the set.
4691200	4695200	And then I took the monitor, which cost three grand.
4695200	4701200	I found out later on and smashed it and put my feet through it with my Doc Martens.
4701200	4704200	It was totally premeditated because I was like, my Chuck Taylor's are going to.
4704200	4705200	Yeah.
4705200	4706200	Yeah.
4706200	4707200	I need to wear my fucking steel toed docs.
4707200	4708200	Yes.
4708200	4709200	A fucking steel toed monitors.
4709200	4710200	Get 12 holes.
4710200	4711200	12 holes.
4711200	4712200	Yeah.
4712200	4713200	Yeah.
4713200	4714200	Yeah.
4714200	4715200	When I'm a baby.
4715200	4719200	So so you know, if we're making the movie, it's the guy getting ready for war.
4719200	4723200	You know, I mean, when he needs, you know, the weaponry, you know, so I got my Doc Martens.
4723200	4725200	I'm ready to go smash up the Arsenio Hall show.
4725200	4731200	And I throw the mattresses into the audience and and why were there mattresses?
4732200	4734200	The cushions from the couch.
4734200	4739200	And then the producers like saying get him and Arsenio tackles me.
4739200	4744200	And as we're going to commercial, he whispers in my ear, he goes, thank you.
4744200	4750200	And so I leave the show acting like no big deal.
4750200	4754200	And I'm now coloring with my daughter and she's eight and we're coloring.
4754200	4755200	Oh my God.
4755200	4756200	And then the news comes on.
4756200	4760200	It goes, comedian goes berserk on the Arsenio Hall show.
4760200	4764200	And Tasha goes, I go, what?
4764200	4769200	She goes, sometimes you act like you don't have a brain in your head.
4769200	4771200	And I go, but it was just a bit.
4771200	4772200	It's just comedy.
4772200	4776200	She goes, if it was comedy, it wouldn't be on the news.
4776200	4784200	And then she goes, then she goes, Lily's dad's not on the news.
4784200	4785200	Eight years old.
4785200	4786200	Yeah.
4786200	4787200	Yeah.
4787200	4789200	Tasha is smarter than all of us, right?
4789200	4790200	She totally is.
4790200	4792200	I like that she was doing the math.
4792200	4793200	She goes, well, wait.
4793200	4795200	No, her dad's in dresses.
4795200	4800200	But I used to always ever since high school, I used to wear dresses, you know, like skirts.
4800200	4802200	And it wasn't it was not.
4802200	4803200	And I didn't do it for camp.
4803200	4809200	It was my way of saying, you know, if you go to a football party and you show up in some smart looking cool.
4809200	4813200	It fucks up the football team harder than anything.
4813200	4815200	You know, I like that you had smart cool.
4815200	4816200	I had very smart.
4816200	4818200	So I was always like wearing skirts and stuff.
4818200	4820200	And when Tasha was little, I'd always be in a skirt.
4820200	4825200	And then one day I woke her up for school and she goes, dad, I've never seen that sweater.
4825200	4830200	She goes, that would go so well with your brown skirt.
4830200	4833200	I was like, yeah, you're right.
4833200	4836200	Can we can we do a show where we bring Tasha and you out?
4836200	4837200	I wonder if she would do it.
4837200	4838200	That's pretty funny.
4838200	4840200	She must because she's fucking groovy.
4840200	4841200	Yeah.
4841200	4842200	Well, now that's all built up.
4842200	4846200	I don't know if she's really smart, she'll stay away.
4846200	4847200	She sounds like the kind of person.
4847200	4848200	Yeah.
4848200	4849200	Yeah.
4849200	4850200	Curtis, how's your daughter doing?
4850200	4851200	She's out in Europe still.
4851200	4852200	Yeah.
4852200	4853200	She's in London.
4853200	4854200	Yeah.
4854200	4859200	She just she just produced her first night of music at Shacklewell Arms.
4859200	4861200	Three bands.
4861200	4865200	She is now going places.
4865200	4866200	So cool.
4866200	4867200	Nineteen.
4867200	4870200	I wish I had a daughter that was a genius.
4870200	4871200	That'd be so cool.
4871200	4872200	I know.
4872200	4873200	It's fun.
4873200	4874200	You may.
4875200	4879200	You mean, I might already.
4879200	4880200	Yeah, man.
4880200	4885200	You're a you're a randy little goat.
4885200	4888200	That tour and nom we did, man.
4888200	4893200	It's not like we were being careful about anything but protecting democracy.
4893200	4894200	Let me rewrite that.
4894200	4896200	Let me rewrite that.
4896200	4900200	It's not like we were protecting anything but democracy.
4900200	4904200	Obviously less of a laugh, but you've spliced it together in a little.
4904200	4907200	It's not that important.
4907200	4916040	I mean, in the realm of like male comedians, especially the amount of misogyny, like there's
4916040	4921480	so much women hating in male comics, like it's it's kind of axiomatic.
4921480	4928960	It's very cool and like very respectful, respectable that there's two guys that you guys been doing
4928960	4933960	comedy for so long and you have a female daughter that you look up to and like like
4933960	4934960	that.
4934960	4940960	That takes a lot of balls to have a female daughter.
4940960	4942560	I think we just have a daughter.
4942560	4943560	Nope.
4943560	4946800	She's going to be a female daughter.
4946800	4947800	You know what I'm fucking saying.
4947800	4948800	But thank you.
4948800	4953440	That's like it's a there's there's so much massage and it also just also in comedians
4953440	4958040	misanthropy like across the board, like the fact that you like you look up to the women
4958040	4960520	in your life like makes me very, very happy.
4960520	4965600	And I've met Tasha and Tasha couldn't be cooler and couldn't love you more.
4965600	4970800	Like she she speaks of you so highly Bob that it's like I think she she doesn't see your
4970800	4971800	face too.
4971800	4975600	I don't think it's like a secret that she tells people that she barely knows like me
4975600	4978560	that how much she like looks up to you and worships you.
4978560	4979960	But also she gives you shit.
4979960	4986000	She is fucking cool because she really is like, yeah, like she's high.
4986200	4993360	Yeah, like I mean, yeah, we always got a pet name is a jerk, but she she loves to, you
4993360	4999280	know, like if I'm in a mall, so the Bobcat Bobcat golf weight.
4999280	5002200	Yeah, shit chills.
5002200	5008000	So I thought the story once Tony V. It was at the Riviera as a comedian, buddy of mine.
5008000	5015640	And it was my birthday and and Robin was playing the MGM and we were all hanging out that weekend.
5015640	5018560	And I hadn't been on stage in five years because I've been directing the Kimmel show
5018560	5020440	and doing other stuff.
5020440	5024800	And Tony's having a, you know, it wasn't the greatest crowd and I go, Tony, bring me up.
5024800	5025800	And he's like, really?
5025800	5026800	I go.
5026800	5027800	Yeah.
5027800	5029720	And I went up and I started performing and my daughter's like, do the voice.
5029720	5035080	And fucking relentless.
5035080	5038720	And then and then Robin was like, bring me up, you know, and I was like, all right.
5038720	5039720	And then he came up.
5039720	5042480	It was just, yeah, I know.
5042480	5045360	And Tony, we had so much fun.
5045360	5047200	This is not that long ago.
5047200	5051640	And you would be amazed how many people would be like, you know, you know, more to the,
5051640	5053400	you know, I mean, this is that long.
5053400	5054400	Yeah.
5054400	5058160	So we're we're playing blackjack and Tony's a really big guy and this guy goes, hey, Mark,
5058160	5059400	where's Mindy?
5059400	5066840	And Tony goes, she's over at fuck off and asked you to join her.
5066840	5068560	I remember, too, is just so many.
5068560	5073080	It was age appropriate women would go nuts for Robin.
5073080	5079280	Like we had to like, that's a weird way to back into that story.
5079280	5084960	No, I just never seen like these cougars, saber-toothed tigers, they were going mental.
5084960	5089600	They were like, they like it was like the Beatles, but these women were menopausal.
5089600	5091520	They were like chasing him.
5091520	5092520	It was harder.
5092520	5093520	It's a harder get.
5093520	5097920	It's a it's a it's a more respectable, like, and it's funny you say that I'm not sexist.
5098280	5100680	These menopausal women that were age appropriate.
5100680	5101680	But that's really what happened.
5101680	5102680	I'm listening.
5102680	5103680	You weren't.
5103680	5104680	I'm saying your daughter's not.
5104680	5105680	Yeah.
5105680	5113480	I was like, I was like, dude, you could pull so much steel wool if you want to see I'm
5113480	5114480	not sexist.
5114480	5119720	I just wanted to crush any goodwill that you had developed for me.
5119720	5121600	Still hurts.
5121600	5122600	Still hurts.
5123600	5127120	But it gets, it polishes you really clean.
5129120	5133920	You know, I mentioned that earlier, though, the last time he and I went on stage was at
5133920	5134920	your show.
5134920	5138440	And I remember he was just here at the at Mountaine, he goes, what are you doing?
5138440	5139880	I go, I'm about to do a podcast.
5139880	5140880	So he just stayed.
5140880	5141880	Yeah.
5141880	5142880	And I was like, I go, you want to go?
5142880	5143880	He's like, no, I don't want to go.
5143880	5144880	I was like, you don't have to go up.
5144880	5151880	And then I remember him just like, like, he's like, you know, put me in coach and he came
5151880	5152880	out.
5152880	5153880	He was sitting where Curtis is sitting.
5153880	5155160	He was wearing his little windbreaker.
5155160	5158640	And he was I never he was so shy.
5158640	5163160	And so he came out here and you did the bit, Dan, where like, you're like, like, fuck these
5163160	5164160	people don't deserve us.
5164160	5167480	Like Bobcat goes away and you came out and you told Bobcat to fuck off.
5167480	5171080	And then you got Robin Williams and Robin came out and I'm sitting here.
5171080	5172560	So I don't know that that's a joke.
5172560	5173560	I didn't.
5173560	5177760	And Robin came out and gave me like a niggy and like a headlock because I just met at
5177760	5181240	Eric's house like two nights before we sang songs.
5181240	5184080	Like when you go to Eric's house, like you sing.
5184080	5189120	And and when he left the stage, he hugged me and I held him and I said, like, thank you
5189120	5191840	for making everyone think that you and I are great friends.
5191840	5199160	Well, I have a good story about once in my act is a shaggy dog joke that I tell.
5199160	5200160	But it's a true story.
5200160	5201160	And I won't go into the whole story.
5201160	5202560	I'll try to do a truncated version.
5202560	5203560	Tell the whole thing.
5203560	5204560	All right.
5205360	5207080	I don't know if you ever the airplane story.
5207080	5208080	It is a true story.
5208080	5213280	I was on a flight going from Los Angeles to New York and midway through the engine blew
5213280	5215400	up and it was terrifying.
5215400	5217680	It was really and I've had enough turbulence and stuff.
5217680	5223800	The plane just suddenly was just dumping and and it was like G-force kind of stuff.
5223800	5225640	You know, it was really scary.
5225640	5226640	People were screaming.
5226640	5230480	I was like staying calm, check out the flight attendants, flight attendants are looking
5230480	5236480	out the window, turn around sobbing, sobbing flight attendants.
5236480	5237480	I'm not exaggerating.
5237480	5241480	And they're holding each other's hands like I always thought you were professional, Karen.
5241480	5249480	And I got to say, I was like completely out of my body and I'm like, all right.
5249480	5253080	And the pilot's like, hello, ladies and gentlemen, this is your pilot.
5253080	5254320	There's no reason to be alarmed.
5254320	5257640	You know, the placating tone in his voice.
5257640	5262640	This one's for the black box on the black box alone.
5262640	5267160	I just want to say, they told me in the event this isn't a suicide.
5267160	5271240	My insurance is valid.
5271240	5277960	And I am of sound body and mind when we got a Demetri Martin was on the flight and we
5277960	5282520	were just we were dying because we're sitting there and Demetri's looking out the window
5282520	5288840	going, if a landscape is a horizon, then our horizon forms the letter H.
5288840	5293440	But he says, no, we both, after we survived this, we both kept going, there's no reason
5293440	5296600	to be alarmed because the guy kept saying that every time.
5296600	5297600	Don't be afraid.
5297600	5298600	There's no reason to be alarmed.
5298600	5302240	So, and I'm like, this is the time to, you know, that's not comforting.
5302240	5305640	If the guy was like going, holy fuck, you know, I go, oh, this guy's in it.
5305640	5306640	You know, he's in it.
5306760	5313120	You know, if he was if he said, like, OK, this is fucked up for me too, but I got this.
5313120	5314120	Yeah.
5314120	5315960	Or look, I'm going to try some shit.
5315960	5318000	I learned in pilot school.
5318000	5319000	Yeah.
5319000	5321080	I'm not making any promises.
5321080	5322080	Yeah.
5322080	5323080	Yeah.
5323080	5324080	Yeah.
5324080	5326080	Everybody get up, move to the left of the plane.
5326080	5327080	Wherever you are.
5327080	5328080	I'm going to fuck.
5328080	5329080	I'm going to freestyle.
5329080	5330080	OK.
5330080	5333000	Or if he said, OK, here's the final refinement on that.
5333520	5340920	He goes, the bad news is all bets are off in terms of like FAA and everything.
5340920	5345000	The good news is that means I get to do whatever the fuck I want.
5345000	5350320	And ladies and gentlemen, I'm fucking good.
5350320	5359200	Or if he's just like, smoke, smoke them if you fucking got them, kiss, light it up.
5359200	5360200	Kiss a stranger.
5360200	5361200	Rub him out in your seat.
5361200	5366080	And everybody turn to your neighbor and just go down.
5366080	5372960	So if you're an atheist and you've ever fantasized about throwing your baby like a football,
5372960	5375000	now would be the time to do it.
5375000	5376000	No one will ever know.
5376000	5377000	No reason to be alarmed.
5377000	5383680	You got a 15 second window to spike that baby and do this.
5383680	5386240	Think about all the times it kept you up at 3 a.m.
5386240	5390560	All I can say is this is 100% true.
5390560	5395520	Other people on the flight was a good portion of the United States Special Olympics team.
5395520	5397040	This is a relax.
5397040	5400920	Just let me finish the story.
5400920	5404260	It was 45 men and women in red, white, and blue running suits with metal.
5404260	5409200	So if it wasn't the Special Olympics team, it was a really big hip hop group with down
5409200	5410200	syndrome.
5410200	5413240	So this isn't very delayed.
5413240	5414240	Yeah.
5414240	5415240	This isn't.
5415240	5417080	That's the title of this episode, by the way.
5417080	5427000	So the plane's craning towards the earth.
5427000	5429800	And I'm thinking, oh, I'm dying.
5429800	5430800	And I thought of Tasha.
5430800	5433080	And I thought of my friends.
5433080	5437720	And then Claire Isabelle, the guy's back on, he's like, there's no reason to be alarmed.
5437720	5442160	Because he's like, oh, that was the first announcement was, we're going to land in Cleveland
5442160	5446120	in two to two and a half minutes.
5446120	5453000	Was that the scheduled stop, or is he just saying, no, no, we're going to New York.
5453000	5454800	It's like a Sucker Brothers movie.
5454800	5455800	He's like, OK.
5455800	5459800	The gate is 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H.
5459800	5460800	Cleveland.
5460800	5461800	Cleveland.
5461800	5466120	No, so we're dumping the plane in Cleveland.
5466120	5471160	And then he goes, when we land, the runway will be covered entirely in foam.
5471160	5473040	Swear to God.
5474040	5478320	At the very end of the runway will be a fire truck.
5478320	5483280	And I'm sitting there, I'm like, this is it, you know?
5483280	5488240	And Claire Isabelle, and Dimitri can back this up, Claire Isabelle, a voice in the back
5488240	5492040	of the plane went, fire truck!
5492040	5494040	True.
5494040	5498040	Swear to God.
5498040	5499040	OK.
5499040	5500040	And he was excited.
5500040	5501040	And I laughed.
5502040	5503040	And nobody else.
5503040	5504040	I'm like, fire truck?
5504040	5506040	You didn't hear fire truck?
5511040	5515040	I went, that was the moment I went from atheist agnostic.
5515040	5517040	I was like, you know what?
5517040	5520040	There really might be some sort of higher duty in this world.
5520040	5521040	There's a possibility.
5521040	5525040	Yeah, there's a higher power.
5525040	5526040	And I know.
5526040	5528040	There might also be some apples.
5528040	5529040	Apples?
5529040	5534040	And I know people that go, you know, they are like, and when I tell this story, people,
5534040	5536040	of course, come up to me.
5536040	5540040	But the thing is, I know plenty of people have mentally challenged folks in their family,
5540040	5541040	or they work with them.
5541040	5545040	But if you don't think they say or do anything funny, you're denying that they're human beings.
5545040	5549040	Because that's the funniest fucking thing I've ever heard another human being say.
5549040	5551040	Fire truck!
5551040	5554040	And the tag is, I was always trying to figure out who was going to get top billing if the
5554040	5555040	plane crashed.
5555040	5559040	I was going to say, Special Olympics team dies in fiery crash, also on board 80s comedian
5559040	5561040	Bobcat Goldlight.
5561040	5565040	Or Bobcat Goldlight Special Olympics team, and you go, yeah.
5565040	5566040	I was right.
5566040	5575040	So, so, the second time I tell that story, which is, it is a hundred percent true story.
5575040	5579040	The second time I tell that story, I'm into my act about 10 to 15 minutes, and this woman
5579040	5586040	gets up and she's, because I didn't have that tag that deflected, she goes, my son is,
5586040	5591040	you know, and she's all upset because she storms out and she makes a point and then goes to
5591040	5592040	the door and that door is locked.
5592040	5595040	And then she has to come back through.
5595040	5596040	And it's horrible.
5596040	5597040	And she's got a table full of friends.
5597040	5600040	And this, I was really into my act, seriously, 10, 15 minutes.
5600040	5602040	And I go, is that lady gone?
5602040	5603040	I go, is she really gone?
5603040	5604040	Is she out of the building?
5604040	5605040	They go, yeah.
5605040	5606040	I go, all right.
5607040	5610040	He, I'm not going to do my act.
5610040	5613040	And he doesn't know this, but here's my friend Robin Williams.
5613040	5615040	Robin, come up here and finish this act.
5615040	5619040	And so he comes up and he does like an hour of stand up.
5619040	5621040	Was she gone or was she not gone?
5621040	5622040	Yes, she was gone.
5622040	5628040	So then I come back and I go, all right, text your friend right now.
5628040	5630040	Let her know what happened.
5630040	5633040	So, you know, because she's like, oh, what happened after I left?
5633040	5636040	Well, he left and Robin Williams did an hour.
5639040	5641040	I hope you made your point.
5645040	5648040	All my stories about Robin aren't like, like people are like, oh,
5648040	5650040	and then he said this and it was wonderful.
5650040	5653040	It's always about me throwing him under the bus.
5653040	5654040	They really are.
5654040	5657040	Using him as a get out of jail freak.
5657040	5660040	We were in the Caribbean and this barracuda was snorkeling.
5660040	5663040	It comes up and it just jerks up and it's right eye to eye with us.
5663040	5665040	And I'd love to tell you I'm a better man than this.
5665040	5668040	I grabbed him, put him right between me and the barracuda.
5668040	5669040	Not for a laugh.
5672040	5674040	It's just pure instinct.
5674040	5675040	Wait a minute.
5675040	5677040	You grabbed Robin as a human shield?
5677040	5678040	Yeah.
5678040	5679040	Yeah.
5679040	5681040	You're like Martin Sheen in the dead zone.
5681040	5684040	I'm ashamed.
5684040	5686040	And I even could have got out of it because we both started laughing
5686040	5688040	when we run out of the water.
5688040	5690040	And he goes, you did that on purpose, didn't you?
5690040	5695040	I was like, yeah, I did.
5695040	5699040	You've had a good run, you know.
5699040	5705040	It would be Robin Williams and other attack by barracuda.
5705040	5706040	But yeah.
5706040	5708040	I've been on lots of planes where I was like, oh shit,
5708040	5711040	I'll be a footnote on this plane because George Takai is on the plane.
5711040	5714040	But like Sulu is on the plane.
5714040	5717040	I will not be mentioned on that plane crash.
5718040	5719040	Sulu was great.
5719040	5721040	Sulu got on the plane before me and Greg Proops,
5721040	5722040	and he got on the plane.
5722040	5726040	And he's walking up, and there's a guy like, hello, Mr. Proops.
5726040	5727040	Hello, Mr. Sonza.
5727040	5730040	Oh, Mr. Takei.
5730040	5732040	And there's the guy working the gate.
5732040	5737040	He's, I just saw you on an episode of like fucking,
5737040	5741040	what's the fucking show, fucking some sitcom, the Big Bang Theory.
5741040	5744040	He goes, I just saw you on an episode of Big Bang Theory.
5744040	5747040	And George Takei goes, oh, that's very good news.
5747040	5749040	I can expect a residual.
5753040	5755040	He was so good.
5756040	5758040	You're never going to worry about crashing
5758040	5760040	when fucking Sulu is on your fucking plane.
5760040	5761040	That's very good news.
5761040	5763040	Well, come on.
5765040	5767040	In the show, he's sitting in front of a prop.
5767040	5769040	He's not able to control.
5769040	5771040	The ship's not in space.
5771040	5772040	I feel like just psychologically,
5772040	5775040	we all feel like this is the best plane you're ever going to be on,
5775040	5778040	because he sat in front of a spaceship that never died.
5780040	5781040	Well, I don't know.
5781040	5782040	No, I don't care.
5782040	5785040	I'm being an asshole.
5786040	5788040	Big Bang Theory.
5788040	5790040	Yeah, Big Bang Theory.
5790040	5792040	You're just mad that I said Big Bang Theory.
5792040	5793040	Yes, yes.
5793040	5795040	No, no, you've told that story before.
5795040	5796040	He's heard this story.
5796040	5798040	George Takei, that's all.
5799040	5803040	And I'm preoccupied about the show.
5803040	5805040	We've got to wrap the show up.
5805040	5807040	We've been doing a lot of talking.
5807040	5808040	Yeah, but you don't get to leave.
5808040	5809040	All right.
5809040	5816040	Can I make you guys play the game with us for five minutes?
5816040	5818040	I was so good at Dungeons and Dragons.
5818040	5819040	Sure.
5820040	5826040	Let's play a fast and furious combat riddled Shadowrun right now.
5826040	5829040	We've got an Eve Libertine and a Dr. Friend,
5829040	5831040	so we need to bring Demorge out here.
5831040	5832040	Demorge Brown?
5832040	5833040	Shit.
5843040	5844040	Hello, Demarge.
5844040	5845040	Hello, hello, hello.
5845040	5850040	We're bringing you in the dying embers of a soccer game right now.
5850040	5852040	Do I have a bad count?
5852040	5854040	Do you have a better bird's eye?
5854040	5855040	No, we're all good, man.
5855040	5856040	They can be living embers.
5856040	5857040	Okay.
5857040	5858040	Curtis is going to hand them out,
5858040	5861040	because I usually do that pretty badly.
5861040	5867040	So in the post-feminist progression of the show,
5867040	5869040	we're bringing no women up.
5871040	5872040	Because you know why?
5872040	5875040	Because they can take care of themselves.
5879040	5881040	Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
5881040	5884040	And if you don't believe that, maybe you hate women.
5884040	5889040	See you next week.
5889040	5892040	Yeah, I know.
5894040	5896040	All right, so we're...
5896040	5899040	Spencer, as I recall last time,
5899040	5900040	you guys fought a bunch of ghouls.
5900040	5903040	There was a ghoul magnet in a briefcase.
5903040	5904040	Ghoul magnet?
5904040	5906040	You guys beat up a bunch of ghouls.
5906040	5908040	What was happening after that, Spencer?
5908040	5909040	Should we get a recap for that?
5909040	5912040	Well, I mean, that was basically the whole recap,
5913040	5914040	but I mean, I could do it.
5914040	5916040	But no, nothing happened after that.
5916040	5918040	Okay, let's skip the recap just for time's sake.
5918040	5919040	Jump in.
5919040	5923040	Okay, so right now, we have a briefcase full of a ghoul magnet.
5923040	5925040	We got fucked over.
5925040	5927040	We didn't get the money, right?
5927040	5928040	You did not.
5928040	5930040	We were supposed to get paid by R. Johnson.
5930040	5931040	He fucking boned out.
5931040	5933040	And now we're standing in a parking lot,
5933040	5936040	and we have a lot of questions.
5936040	5938040	We're inside a chain-linked...
5938040	5941040	You're outside of a chain-linked parking lot.
5941040	5942040	All right.
5942040	5944040	Nearby a dead gas station.
5944040	5946040	I'm holding the ghoul magnet briefcase?
5946040	5948040	Yeah, it's beeping.
5948040	5950040	They gave us a fucking ghoul magnet,
5950040	5952040	and I throw it.
5954040	5956040	All right.
5956040	5958040	Nightblade, what was the name of R. Johnson?
5958040	5961040	What was that guy's name that fucking just screwed us over?
5961040	5963040	I tell him.
5963040	5964040	Spencer?
5964040	5967040	He tells you that he didn't ask,
5967040	5969040	because he didn't do due diligence.
5969040	5971040	We didn't get the name of that guy?
5971040	5972040	No, you sure didn't.
5972040	5974040	Well, the point of a shadow run, really,
5974040	5977040	is more about not leaving a paper chart.
5977040	5978040	Can I...
5978040	5980040	Has enough time passed where I...
5980040	5983040	As Eve Libertine, can I cast as kind of a spirit
5983040	5986040	or like an eagle to like fly off
5986040	5989040	and follow the car of the person that drove away from us
5989040	5990040	and follow that guy?
5990040	5992040	It's been far too long for that.
5992040	5994040	You can send him to search,
5994040	5996040	but it'll be some time before he...
5996040	6001040	Okay, I send off a search eagle
6001040	6003040	to follow that guy,
6003040	6006040	because there will be comeuppance for that guy, for sure.
6006040	6008040	How strong...
6008040	6009040	Sick.
6009040	6015040	Hey, can I use my agony spell on the guy,
6015040	6018040	even though he's getting away,
6018040	6020040	but it's a long-distance agony spell?
6020040	6021040	Can I do one of those?
6021040	6023040	You don't have line of sight to him.
6023040	6025040	He's far, far off, so...
6025040	6028040	But my mother could do that without seeing me.
6031040	6033040	But even if you were just going to try, Curtis...
6033040	6035040	I could try.
6035040	6036040	Even if you were just going to try,
6036040	6038040	I'd probably sound like...
6042040	6046040	Agony!
6046040	6050040	Wait, Spencer, is there a way that I can send my eagle
6050040	6052040	that goes off to search for him
6052040	6055040	and carry that agony along with...
6055040	6057040	Can we team up?
6057040	6061040	Can we team up his agony spell on my spiritual eagle to fly...
6061040	6064040	I'm trying to get us out of here in time!
6064040	6066040	Yeah, yeah.
6066040	6067040	Is that a possibility?
6067040	6069040	Yeah, but it'll take some special doings.
6069040	6070040	All right.
6070040	6071040	What kind?
6071040	6072040	It's a lot harder.
6072040	6073040	You could pass out.
6073040	6074040	You could even die.
6074040	6075040	Oh, shit.
6075040	6076040	What, the eagle?
6076040	6078040	No.
6078040	6081040	Spencer, I'm willing to try it.
6081040	6083040	I'm willing to sacrifice it.
6083040	6087040	If you put the agony on my spiritual eagle...
6087040	6090040	But also, I have a lot of spirit sense.
6090040	6094040	I touch my red feather earring on my right ear
6094040	6098040	that gives me special spiritual power with spirits of air.
6098040	6100040	That should protect me more.
6100040	6101040	That should protect me more.
6101040	6104040	And I go, Dr. Friend, hold my hand.
6104040	6106040	Hold my hand.
6106040	6108040	Well, let's all hold hands just in case.
6108040	6109040	Let's all hold hands.
6109040	6110040	Everybody!
6110040	6113040	If we all hold hands, if we all hold hands together...
6113040	6114040	All right.
6117040	6120040	I'm holding my spiritual eagle to go...
6120040	6121040	Yes!
6121040	6125040	To go find this motherfucker who gave us a fucking...
6125040	6127040	Who gave us a cool magnet instead of money.
6127040	6130040	There is a swirling combination of spirits
6130040	6133040	following through Hautegard's body.
6133040	6136040	I'm elevating it with my own volumizer
6136040	6138040	and sending it back through to the doctor
6138040	6141040	and circling it back through to the eagle.
6141040	6143040	Agony!
6146040	6148040	Fly, eagle!
6148040	6149040	Fly!
6149040	6152040	Go as he know you, the Hayaku!
6154040	6157040	I sense that the only thing that could possibly be holding this back
6157040	6160040	is the psychic blockage in my own body.
6160040	6162040	So I lock eyes with Dr. Friend
6162040	6166040	and continuing an arc that was established five episodes ago,
6166040	6169040	I say, I'm gay too!
6170040	6173040	I'm gay too!
6176040	6179040	Cliffhanger!
6180040	6182040	All right.
6183040	6185040	See, role-playing is easy.
6187040	6190040	People act like it has to do with numbers and...
6190040	6192040	Demarj Brown!
6193040	6195040	I'm Jeff Davis.
6195040	6198040	We've also had Spencer Crittenden.
6200040	6202040	Curtis Armstrong.
6203040	6205040	Bobcat Goldthwaite.
6207040	6209040	Dan Harmon.
6212040	6216040	I demand, as comptroller of Harmon Town,
6216040	6220040	that Curtis and Bob come back to finish what we started
6220040	6223040	on this fucking Shadow Run.
6223040	6224040	Thank you so much, everybody.
6224040	6226040	Drive fast and take chances.
6228040	6230040	Keep your eyes peeled for Call Me Lucky
6230040	6235040	and it'll be on your God Knows What medium soon.
6242040	6244040	Did you get any of that?
6244040	6247040	It's a good show!
