0	15520	Welcome, team. Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, shall we? Harmanstown is now in session.
15520	27520	Let's also bring out Brandon Johnson. Brandon Johnson's here, too. And just for good measure
27520	30160	at Harmanstown, let's bring out the mayor of Harmanstown, Dan Harman.
38160	45600	Rockin' to the beat, going downstairs, saw your mama, said, hey, okay. I got excited,
45600	52720	but then I got just, something happened. I don't know. I got terrified. I didn't want to
53440	57840	rap all of a sudden, really fast. I went from wanting to rap really bad to not wanting to
57840	62960	rap really fast. Because you didn't feel the flow? Yeah, I think the flow got a little clogged,
62960	69600	and then I just panicked. How do we unclog that flow? I mean, I'm being for real right now.
69600	76720	A hot towel. Is there a flow? A hot towel? Yeah. Welcome back, Spencer. Thanks, man.
76800	84800	Spencer is back. Oh, I got a couch. I see you've accepted my demands for
85600	93360	one couch and one pointed polished pyramid. Yeah, we don't, we don't, we typically don't air
93360	98640	our contract renegotiations here at Harmanstown. You know, the grievances and what we keep,
98640	104320	we keep a line there. Everything else is transparency and stuff, but it is rough. His
104320	109040	contract was up, you know, and it was like, I should have never signed you to a one plus one.
110560	115280	It was weird because like I wanted to agree, but like the Spencer's Guild was like, no.
118000	120320	He's got his own guild. I had to authorize the strike.
121840	129120	How are the Spencer's Guild and Producer Guild negotiations going?
129120	134080	It's hard to tell who's talking about anything. Like what stance anyone's taking.
134080	138160	Because you're also a producer. Well, yeah, I mean, I'm both sides of the table.
138160	142480	I'm on both sides of the table and like, it's hard. Yeah, exactly. So it's always in my own
142480	149360	benefit. How's HarmanQuest? Oh, it's so good. I know. I don't know. Sometimes I'm getting
149360	155360	real mad and then I'm like, this is bad. It's the best job in the world. It's like,
155360	159440	you should be getting mad. What are you getting mad at? Just like at the boards,
159440	164560	all these boards. I'm like, oh, just like things that need a job. Yeah. It's just, yeah,
164560	168800	but it's so fun. Holy shit. I mean, you talked about it in the last episode. I heard, I was like,
168800	175280	hell yeah. He's lying about the show. Yeah. And you know, Cody, like not only has never
175280	180400	seen it before, but she's watching an animatic. She's watching a thing with her fiance's ex wife
180400	185040	in it. Not that she has any, she doesn't have any pettiness there, but I'm just saying like,
185040	188720	there's a lot of English on that ball. It's not predisposed to like it. But she was like,
189440	194640	and she's never seen the first season. So all of these things, she was like, oh my God,
194640	199520	that's so like great. She was like really into it. Like she's like, I understood all the jokes.
199520	204560	I don't care about no D and D, but it was like, like, Aaron's really funny and everything's like
204560	210640	working really good. And yeah, it's the only, the only, the only thing is I, I just like,
211360	219840	I'm not going to like assess over it, but like, I just, I can't believe the lethargy on my face,
219840	224000	like in the beginning, it's like crazy. The first season, I guess, cause we're like,
224000	227680	oh, how do we do it? And then I, so then we did like a bunch of takes where I was like,
228400	234960	John Oliver, oh, you know, like, which you do need to do because the camera takes away
234960	239520	10 pounds of energy. So this time around, which is really light in the first place.
239600	243200	I just remember being like, oh, I'm, I'm real chill. It's like, let's just harm a quest. It's
243200	247040	like this. Let's just have some fun. And I'm watching. I'm like, am I blind? I look like
247040	251680	I'm blind. That's true. Yeah. You're not like looking, you're like not looking at any single
251680	256240	thing and it's really off putting. So here's the thing. Yeah, it is. Everyone hated it.
256240	260720	Like, like, I just, I wish somebody would have hit me with a stick and said that we're doing
260720	265600	another take you gotta, but here's the thing about those cameras. Like it's one thing to,
266400	270480	you know, if you had stage fright versus like, oh, I'm comfortable, people looking at me,
270480	275280	I'll be fine. And then there's, there is another layer where you do like a single camera work
275280	280720	or it's like, okay, there's a camera over here or right here or whatever, but it's one camera.
281440	285360	And my job is to ignore it. My job is to focus on the cookies. Cause my
285360	289120	right. You can never look at it. And then there's this, that, that live
289920	295600	uh, for before where your solo cam is the tally light comes on in your camera too.
295600	299280	That's your, that's your camera, but it's not even like, cause we're not doing it live. So it's not
299280	304880	even like the, the, the, the, the red light comes on. It's more like, the director says to you,
304880	309840	Hey, Dan, if you, when you're going to look at the camera, that's the, that's your camera and
309840	316640	points at one of the cameras. And so the thing that freaks me out is I go, okay, so I know it's
316640	323200	not live. They're not editing in board. So that like, it's sort of like, it puts it in my head
323200	329920	that it's like, I have control over whether the, it cuts to me. And so then I'm like, well, I'm
329920	334080	never going to make the decision for it to cut to me. So then I'm like, yeah, that's how I feel.
334800	338880	It's just a weird thing that it doesn't matter how talented a performer or how comfortable in
338880	342560	your own skin you might be. It's a totally different talent. I think section of the idea
342560	347920	that not being thrown by this idea, like on whose line there's tally lights where the red
347920	355040	light comes on. They're just doing it like in a fake, like live edit. And then they, seven or
355040	359280	eight cameras are all rolling at the same time. So they're, they're all good to go. No matter where
359280	365760	you're looking, that camera is rolling. But on, on Herman quest, there's no tally light. The light,
365760	369920	the red light doesn't come on and says, this is the one that's on you right now. But you can take
369920	375760	a camera take to any camera at any time. And that can be in the edit. Yeah. You can also get
375760	380560	the fuck out of there the same way. So if you know that a camera's covering you that you don't
380560	385440	particularly agree with the take on, you can throw the take. Thus, like when you're the camera that's
385440	389840	on you, like this take is going to suck. Cause I fucked up the line straight to camera. Yeah.
389840	394480	But all this, this is showmanship. You guys are talking about, you guys, that's the, that's the,
394480	398480	that's the membrane I'm talking about. I'm like, Spencer and I are over here on this side of like,
399440	404160	our top, the top of our game is like, I'm the world's most comfortable nerd. Like I,
404160	410640	I'm no longer going to vomit by being in front of people or even a camera. But then on the other
410640	416720	side of that line is just like, Oh, while you're playing make believes ease, you're also like,
416720	420480	boy, Karen's hogging the spotlight tonight. Like just sort of like, you're, there's like
420480	425360	calculations going on. And, you know, I was never good at like the long form improv cause
426080	432480	I was just a bad listener. I would just be like, why I just sort of start thinking about like,
432480	436880	Oh, I should, I should come in as a crab or something. And like, like, then I'm like,
436880	441440	I'm writing a crab thing in my head that the other people are going to fuck up when I come in.
442880	448400	Cause it's the improv you moron. And, and the, and for the 30 seconds that I'm sitting there going
448400	452400	like, Oh, and the crabs going to come in and it's, this is what I'm going to do. Like there,
452400	456320	there's things I'm supposed to be listening to. Yeah. For me, like Harmon quest, I, I mean,
456320	460800	I take it like copious notes and I'm writing things down. Cause I want to remember the name
460800	465040	of the thing that Spencer said, the name of the town, all the names, but then while you're
465680	470320	Spencer's laying down all this detail and I'm writing that down, but while it's happening,
470320	475360	something improv is happening and I'm not listening to that. So I've got the detail,
475360	480800	but not the, the moment that just happened. And so it's a hard line to walk. Yeah.
481600	486720	Yeah, baby. Well, let's, let's refine some of our chops tonight. We could do some drills.
487600	493600	All right. All right. Um, why don't we just play some good old fashioned D and D with
493600	500720	Spencer right now? Oh shit. Is that what you meant? The audience wasn't that enthused.
501920	507200	No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh God. I didn't mean like that. And the crowd goes,
507200	513360	I'm trying to get to know you guys. What did you mean precisely, Dan? I was, I was just high.
513360	518160	He wanted to sit. I was going like, well, let's do some dumb improv bits, but.
518160	524960	All right. Let's do dumb improv, but, uh, let's walk the line between thinking ahead and being
524960	529360	in the moment. I'm not going to, uh, I'm only going to be in the moment. You're only in the moment.
529360	532320	You're not going to think about the crab character that's going to come in later on.
533120	538080	Right. All right. So Spencer, like be dungeon master for us and give us like, like, lay a,
538080	543760	lay a, like a scene on us. All right. Uh, uh, can I get a suggestion?
546240	552000	You're on a spaceship. Okay. Snip, snip. I'm a crab. No,
552000	554480	I hope no one's to the left. The direction I move.
554480	568640	Well, captain, uh, friend tester, uh, why did you let your crab out of the tank? You know that
568640	574240	it's against academy regulations to leave, uh, wild animals, uh, on the spaceship.
574240	578400	The academy had it their way. This ship would be made of regulations.
578400	584240	As far as whether Herman is allowed to roam the cabin,
584240	587040	I think he's been on a few more missions than you nurse Falco.
593680	595120	But away he goes.
595120	604800	Oh, damn crab alert. Crab alert.
607360	611440	There's a crab alert installed on the ship. Destroying crab.
614240	616400	No, Herman destroyed.
617760	621280	You don't remember last week when you asked me to put in that crab software.
621440	627920	Cause you told me, uh, you need all these lasers and some of these drinks to be poured on crabs.
628720	634800	Marcus, what are you, are you, uh, I'm, I'm talking to you over the, uh,
634800	642000	telescreen, right? You just, I captain, I you're, you're, you're, you're down in the,
642000	645440	in the mechanic bay. That's where I smoke weed. Yeah.
645440	651840	You can, you can do just about anything with those, uh, computer tools. Can't you Marcus?
651840	656480	Oh man. Dental hygiene, air conditioning. I can tune up a cat.
658080	661360	Anyway, I'm going back to what you were doing. I just wanted to know,
661360	665200	was it successful? Was my crab thing like invention? Was it good? Do you like it?
665200	668640	Yes, it killed my crab. I'm distraught.
670560	673120	I better, uh, I'm going to come down and see you Marcus.
673120	678240	Oh man. I gotta clean this place up first. Okay. Hey, please come down captain, please.
679600	686160	Over and out nurse Falco. Yes. Uh, I'm going to find it hard to believe you didn't know
686160	692320	that was going to happen. I'd be lying if I said I didn't. I tend to know exactly what's
692320	695840	going on aboard the ship. It is my job as the spaceship nurse.
695840	708000	Well, uh, I have a, uh, a little bit of a scrape on one of my fingers. Okay. Uh,
708000	712960	let me attend to that. Oh, oh, it's my middle one. I'm holding up my middle one.
712960	716400	Are you, are you being ironic or are you, are you just telling me to fuck off?
716400	719760	Man the helm, Falco. I'm going to talk to Marcus.
719760	726560	Falco. Falco, pick up. Falco, it's Marcus. Pick up. Falco.
727600	732080	Falco. Yes. Look, uh, captain's on his way down and, uh, I'm not going to be able to see you
732080	738880	tonight. So, um, look, uh, as far as he's concerned, we've never met. We, we don't ever,
739600	745040	we don't ever have anything going on. Okay. Okay. I just, I was, I was gonna,
745040	748560	you know, I was going to put the good shoes on just so you know. All right. Okay.
749920	753600	I'll call you back. What? Jesus. It smells like a skunk down here.
755520	761200	Boy, you can take the city out of the astronauts or wait, you can't.
763120	769840	You can't. You can take the astronaut, astronaut out of the city. That's what you can do.
770800	778800	And what we did do, what we failed to realize we could never do was remove the city from your bones.
779920	788240	You urban magical. Whoa. Look, just sit down, man. All right. I'm glad you're here, captain.
788240	792720	You know, I don't really get a lot of time to do a chance to spend with the higher up. So I'm glad
792720	798960	you came down. Yeah. Did I offend you? No, no, no, no. You want a couple of noodles? Uh, well,
798960	805120	tell you the truth. Wouldn't mind a little of that sticky wicky that I'm smelling everywhere.
805120	809600	I have no idea what you're talking about, officer, but it's right here.
811440	813680	Do you have to press the button five times or?
815840	819040	You can shake it back and forth just to make the setting for yourself if you want.
820480	820960	Right.
820960	829040	It sounds like Cheetos. Fuck. I probably got too high.
833840	837200	That's a signal three. Uh, captain. We have, uh,
837200	846800	we have an incoming message from your arch enemy. Uh, put the weapons on standby,
846800	853600	charge the shields. I'll be right up. Okay. Oh, fuck. Shields charged. Oh, I can't see.
853600	861840	Are you, is anyone there? Johnson, are they on? Oh, wait. It's me. Diablos. Uh, surrender your
861840	874320	spaceship. No. Yes. Johnson. I can't see. Oh, I'm sorry, man. Uh, let me raise up the hailing
874320	879840	shields. No, no. What? No. Oh God. What? Put those back down. Okay.
880800	886000	Use it. Wait, wait. Why can't you see? Those are shields. Yes. But you want to be able to see,
886000	895760	right? Yeah. Okay. So, uh, putting on vision, uh, mode. What? Vision mode enhanced. Marcus,
895760	901360	you have to be the captain. I'm too high. Where, where am I at? No, no. Just do it. Just do it.
902080	908240	I'll tell everyone. I'll tell everyone you got me high. Okay. Okay. Okay. Snark ass, snitch ass
908240	913840	snark. All right. Shields up. We need to get ready for evasive procedures.
916400	926480	Diablo. It is I captain. What exactly do you want from us? Spaceship. What? I want it. Okay. Hold
926480	932240	on for a second. I got you. Hold him on for a second. What are you saying? He wants a spaceship.
932880	939600	Do it's a whole thing. Yeah, we're in it. Sorry. I'm nurse Falco. I think that we should, we,
939600	943680	we shouldn't put the shields up. We should put the, we put the shields back down too.
944240	948480	Like he just did. I think we should, there should be a shields down situation. Are they
948480	955360	on when they're up or down? I thought down was up. Yeah. Well, what? Shields down.
956480	962560	You're the captain Marcus. God damn it. I leave the shields halfway up, halfway down so we can
962560	969200	peer over them and see the enemy Diablo. Do you think the vernacular of the shield technicians
969200	976240	is more rooted in the handheld shields being raised for infantry or the old haggard, the horrible
976240	981280	thing coming down over the, the, the head. I think it's like an engineering thing. Like cuts the
981280	987360	lights or, or is it, does it come down like, like up and down together? What are the states
987360	993040	of the shield that are available? Uh, we have shields up. We have weapon shields and we have
993040	999760	vision shields that you see through a, through a shield. It's not a perfect system here.
1000720	1004880	It looks like their shields are down. I could see the button. Maybe we should just fire on them.
1004880	1010560	Fire Diablo. Oh fuck. See, oh, we're hit. God damn it. And I was looking at these
1010560	1017040	Cheetos. All right. Look, we've been hit under my leadership, which is some bullshit by the way.
1017920	1023520	Thank you. Fucking the worst time to make me captain. Diablo. There are two ships.
1024960	1032720	There are two ships. Oh shit. That's right. And this one is injured. So you will have our other
1032720	1042800	ship. That sounds perfect. Now let us pass and get to safety so we can tell you about that other
1042800	1052880	ship. All right. I'll do that. And then I'll monologue. Excellent. I became Diablo 2000 years
1052960	1063520	ago at the peaks of Mount Olympus on earth. Dot, dot, dot. Oh no.
1067120	1070080	Oh, he's in the background now. He put himself in the background.
1071760	1082400	He became the baby captain. Look next to you. Oh, Red Bull. Oh, drink it.
1082960	1086880	Okay. Drink the Red Bull captain. I just don't think, I mean, it's not like I'm.
1090080	1098240	It gives me heartburn. No, it'll make you come back. Okay. We need your sage leadership.
1098240	1102640	I tried to lead the ship, but I was too high. You did great. You got rid of the guy. What are
1102640	1112080	you talking about? They blew the West Wing off. They did. And I cried. Anyway, get back upstairs
1112160	1117280	and show us why you're the captain. Captain. Okay. Then I went back in there and I said,
1117280	1126640	I'd like my job back. There's Falco. I'm back for the mechanic day. Diablo's monologue completed.
1127840	1134400	Lower all shields. I know it. Lower all shields. Captain, that puts us in a very vulnerable
1134400	1144720	situation. Does it? Yes. That's how ships work. All shields lowered.
1149440	1156480	Diablo's. Yeah, yeah. As you can see, we are quite vulnerable over here. Right.
1156480	1165040	We have no other ship to give you. What? Why was I just monologuing all this time?
1166320	1174880	Cause you're a fool. Oh, a damn fool. No, no. You floated over to a section of space. What?
1174880	1180400	Called the fantabulon zone. But that would mean that I'm getting fantabulous.
1180400	1187760	If you thrust your engines, your entire ship will explode from the chain reaction
1187760	1195760	from the anti dark matter. No one tells Diablo's how to fly. No, boom. Oh,
1197600	1203360	really happened. It actually happened. Captain Francesca. I can't believe that worked. Yeah.
1203360	1208240	I, he, he really, he really fell for that hook line and sinker. I mean, it kind of didn't work
1208240	1214080	because I was bluffing. So my bluff failed miserably because it turns out he was actually
1214080	1220480	in the anti-matter space and really blew up. I thought you knew that. That was your point.
1220480	1226960	No, I was making it up. Couldn't tell. Snap, snap. I'm a ghost. Oh no, it's Diablo's ghost.
1226960	1237040	Diablo's ghost. It's the crab, Marcus. Yes. That's, I'm a crab. Oh, he came back as a crab.
1238240	1248480	All right. Everyone loves us. Dan, you, you were very in the moment there. I kind of, I
1248480	1254800	listen, I spent more time listening than usual. I usually don't listen as much as I was.
1256480	1262400	Cause you're what you're thinking about the next 10 seconds ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I tried not
1262400	1270160	to do that this time. Happy? Yeah. Very, very happy. We, we had a good time. I had a good time.
1272320	1278000	Right. Are you, are you happy? Spencer is back with us. Yeah. Oh yeah. Everyone loves it.
1278800	1283520	Uh, I had to come back cause you said you could do the show without me. So I was like, oh, okay.
1283520	1288560	Yeah. Well explain yourself now. Was it, were you just busy? You said you were bummed out at one
1288560	1293920	point. Yeah. I've been depressed. I've been not feeling great. Uh, I also, I talked about this a
1293920	1299440	little bit, but I have a hip thing. Um, this couch is great actually, but it had been not great to sit
1299440	1304000	for a long time and you know, to drive and then sit and then drive. And then also just as all
1304000	1311360	snowballs, I don't do things for one reason. I do them for 30, but yeah, no, I don't know. It was just,
1311840	1318720	how are you feeling now? Oh yeah. I resigned to my life. No, I'm kidding. Um, are you still in
1318720	1324240	pain? Yeah. Yeah. No, but this couch is actually really nice. I think I'm going to get surgery.
1324240	1330320	It'll be great. People love it. Oh boy. I hope my leg doesn't fall out. I feel if I was sitting
1330320	1336720	in that position, I would, my back would start to get sore. I, my back could take it. It's doing
1336720	1342320	a lot of work lately. You know, when your body's messed up, the rest of your body gets messed up
1342320	1349520	trying to help. Brandon, do you have back pain or anything like that? No, not yet. That's great.
1349520	1355680	Have you guys been to lumbar and silver lake? Oh yeah. Oh, lumbar. Well, uh, you get, you get, uh,
1355680	1362160	uh, I, I like the, uh, synovial fluid, um, teeny. It's great. It's a, yeah, it's, it's part of a new
1362160	1370800	fad. It's like, uh, ergonomic, uh, cocktail culture. Do you, uh, does it have things like
1370800	1375200	anise root in it and like, it's very healthy. It's sort of there. They're like mind drugs
1375200	1379040	because they're all natural elixirs. Is that the sort of situation? No, it's just the furniture is
1379040	1386400	designed by like chiropractors. And then the drinks are normal pretty much. They have dumb names,
1386400	1396880	like lumbar. Yeah. Nice. The list goes on and on. The, uh, a lot of their drinks are just named
1396880	1405600	like S one, S two, S three, S four. Well, a chiropractor. Uh, yeah. What the hell are they
1405600	1411520	doing back there? I'm sure your chiropractors are different. All of them are voodoo people. Um,
1411520	1416560	they, but the weird thing is like, which, how much voodoo did they get from the latest
1416560	1421520	chiropractor convention where it's like high tech voodoo. And then how many of them are like DIY
1421520	1426160	voodoo. And they're like, which like you, you, you mentioned a guy was like, Oh yeah. My parents used
1426160	1430640	to go to a chiropractor who thought like he could tell if you had allergies or something. And what
1430640	1435440	he did is he had a little pack, like a suitcase, little thing that you open up and had all these
1435440	1439840	little vials of, I think, uh, what do you call it? Like homeopathic water that was charged with
1439840	1445680	essences or whatever the fuck. And so presumably these vials had allergens in them and he would
1445680	1452160	hold the allergen near you. And then he would do this with his fingers. Like you're, you're doing
1452160	1457360	like a, give me some change kind of hand sign with your fingers. And he would say that he was
1457360	1463680	tracking, um, the resistance on his fingers because when you would sweat, his hands would cause
1463680	1469600	resistance in his hands. So if the, the allergen was, was close to you and you were allergic,
1469600	1474240	it would make him sweat more, which meant you were allergic. It sounds like the first act of
1474240	1481760	Wizard of Oz. Oh, it is. And then the tornado came. It's, it's all in the high tech stuff is just that
1481760	1487280	except it's like plastic crap that they bought at a booth. So it's like, like, like, my guy would like
1487280	1494000	scan my back with a, uh, a thing that was like basically like, it looked like a handheld paper
1494000	1498160	scanner. Yeah. And I was like, and you would hear, and he would like press a foot pedal and a, and a
1498160	1505520	voice would go as one as to as three. And he was like, like measuring, but then he'd like to do
1505520	1511280	these, but it's all, it's all like muscle tension and, and sweat and stuff. And like, you put your
1511280	1518880	fingers in here. It's all, uh, it's this is what Scientologists use. It is dumb. Oh yeah. It's
1518880	1523600	incredibly dumb. I don't think it's real. I don't think it's accredited science or anything. You
1523600	1530480	know, I think they're just like, Hey, I put a bunch of wires in a box. I went, I, I, I absolutely
1530480	1536080	screwed my back, uh, playing terrible golf in Florida once. And I couldn't even lift up a pencil
1536080	1541840	off the table without like, like weeping in pain. And I went to, uh, a cat that, uh, church has gone
1541840	1547360	to, and he just like instantly fixed me. Like, like he's a bad motherfucker. Yeah. I'll tell you
1547360	1552560	what these guys are good at relieving back pain. Well, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're
1552560	1559040	bad at being content with that station. So like physiotherapy, there are real things. And so I
1559040	1564240	assume all chiropractors have like cobbled together collections of real and fake tools.
1564240	1568320	They're just, they're just so some of them work. They're like, God damn it. They're like, uh,
1568320	1576000	Siri, uh, how often does the average American want their back cracked? Uh, I'm looking that up,
1576000	1582160	uh, six months to three years. God damn it. I'm going to go broken this motherfucker. Um,
1582160	1587200	and then they, so then they just have to, they put up posters. It's like Siri, can you say s one
1587200	1596080	flu as to flu seasons coming. And remember all immuno deficiencies originate in the spinal
1596080	1600640	column. Like, you know, it's just like this whole culture. It's every, everything that a chiropractor
1600640	1609200	can possibly do that will, that the AMA won't like find them for. Um, uh, I don't, I know not of what
1609200	1612480	I speak of how that works, but I don't know if it works like fines or if they just jump in your
1612480	1619120	window. Like, uh, I remember the, the Simpsons, the, uh, the chiropractor guild like coming over
1619120	1626320	and trashing his trash can and then he hits the garage door closes. And then they, like, they,
1626320	1631040	because they're chiropractors, they bend backwards and keep running out the garage. So great.
1631040	1638720	Just peak Simpsons. Um, anyways, uh, boy, what a joyful, that's not like, like, like, what a,
1638720	1642960	what a great time to be in a writer's room. That must've been like, uh, this is like, like, like,
1642960	1647840	oh, Homer, Homer has a dented trash can and it turns out to be like a chiropractic miracle.
1647840	1652880	Like people are coming over to get their bags. That's such a crazy like just episode. It's so
1652880	1658720	satisfying. What season was that? Like, I don't know. I don't know. I didn't really start watching
1658720	1662960	the Simpsons until I moved to LA in, uh, syndication. I would watch the Simpsons and
1662960	1668640	X-Files back to back. Uh, and then I found some naval lint the other day. What is this show?
1669600	1672720	Well, no one's, no one's waiting for me to bring out a parrot.
1675920	1681280	I've been doing a lot of composing in a garage band. Fucking poop song on Instagram.
1681840	1686320	Yeah. You're Saturday, Sunday poop and song was pretty good. Yeah. It's pretty good, man.
1686320	1690800	I just threw that one away. Uh, okay. Kenny logins. Don't brag too much.
1690800	1697600	But I have, I have a couple of garage band, uh, compositions that aren't, they're too
1697600	1703040	soulful to be funny. So I just listened to them on a loop. Can we, can we hear one? We should
1703040	1709920	laugh at those. Yes. We'll be the judge of whether or not I live right now. I can come
1709920	1714320	over and do backup harmonies. Now don't make fun of me. I mean, I guess on one hand, it's like,
1714320	1719200	okay, the reason why I like doing music is because I'm not supposed to be good at it so I can relax
1719200	1723840	and just put myself into it, but I'm getting to a stage now where I'm going to get my feelings
1723840	1729600	heard. If people make fun of me, that's like when Vin Diesel does his kind of like karaoke videos.
1730640	1733040	It's like everyone's loving it, but we can't tell him what we think.
1734640	1738080	I don't, I don't know anything about that, but well, it's easy. He's a delight.
1738960	1744160	Wait, say again. Vin Diesel like sings and he, and he's tender about his, uh, he's loving it.
1744160	1747440	Oh, he's loving it. He's loving it. But is he good or is he terrible? No, he's not.
1748400	1750720	But, but as far as he's concerned, he's rocking it out.
1750720	1752960	Right. Who's going to tell him that?
1752960	1755680	That's why I like karaoke. I go into karaoke.
1755680	1756560	That's a good thing.
1756560	1761600	I want you to place in, uh, in Nashville, Tennessee with Chip Esten and, uh, it's called
1761600	1768960	Santa's pub and it's a, uh, Christmas decorated double wide trailer. As far as I remember,
1768960	1773280	in the middle of fucking nowhere. It's like a perfect place to get a divorce.
1773440	1780480	It's beer only and you cannot bring your drink up on stage. And there's a sign that says no
1780480	1786000	swearing on stage, no cursing on stage. And after I sing my second or third song, I, uh,
1786960	1792560	I believe I brought the house down, uh, or the trailer down and, uh, and I went,
1792560	1796800	I fucking love this place. And he goes, yo, yo, whoa, whoa, whoa, no swearing on stage, man.
1797840	1802320	But he wasn't being a jerk about it. It was the greatest place. It was like, it was the most like
1802400	1804800	Tennessee shit I've ever seen. It was so good.
1805680	1807600	Okay. Here's, here's one of my songs.
1808320	1821600	Yeah. We got, we got mics on this. Yeah. Oh yeah.
1832320	1835600	Oh, the great strings.
1838720	1851600	I rubbed the screen myself for the strings.
1852560	1853360	A little bit of lunacy.
1859440	1862880	Sounds like somebody just scored in another Alan ball movie, huh?
1863840	1869120	That's great. Well, it's good. It's great. It's great. Yeah. Now I'm not making funny here.
1869920	1873280	Are you playing keys on that? Like, are you actually putting down the real time?
1873280	1878640	Because I wouldn't know how to play, but I, uh, like, no, there's like various apps that,
1878640	1885840	that let you like, uh, map out melodies in a, I found this really cool app that you're playing
1885840	1889200	cordial stuff in there too. Right. There's a couple of clams in there. There's a couple
1889200	1894000	of notes. It's a combination of apps. Now, why don't let's play it again and let's put,
1894000	1899040	let's put some words to that. Let's, uh, do you want to sing a song of that then?
1899040	1902160	Because you know, you, you know, the movement or do you want to do Brandon? No, no, we're good.
1902160	1906320	I wonder if there's, should we, should we pick from two? Cause he's, you know,
1907200	1911040	did you say oof in the beginning when that first like sour note happened
1911040	1915760	because that sour note was part of my style. Yeah. It was like, uh,
1915760	1919360	you're, you're Tom Waits. The piano has been drinking. You're fucking out there.
1919360	1925440	I liked that sound. I like, I was, I was like, uh, it's like, um, uh, a simple plan, uh, score.
1926160	1932000	All right. Do you have, let's, uh, you want to go to the cats in trouble. Okay. How many more do
1932000	1936800	you have? What? Oh, I have one more. Let's hear both. And then I think then now we start,
1936800	1942800	we start putting the book to those, uh, to those musics. Okay. No lyrics for this one either,
1942800	1953600	but yet, but here we go. This one's more delightful.
1953600	1978400	This is like some Forrest Gump shit.
1983920	1994240	Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, who knew, who knew that you had all that joy inside of you?
1995200	1999440	That's all from scratch. It's fucking great. That is like, oh, you hit this button and it
1999440	2002960	gives you like a thing. That's like all from scratch. How does the app work? Were you making
2002960	2007360	chords? You just, you just, you, you poke the screen at the spot or you want it. It's different
2007360	2012400	from playing piano. You just, you put a note in a grid and then it gives you the little fill in
2012400	2018320	notes and the, uh, the pass. No, don't say that. I don't know. I'm asking. I'm just saying like,
2018320	2024960	there's no, on that there's no, all those chords are, that's all from scratch. That's, that's all
2024960	2028480	you did all that in a MIDI. Now let's go back to the first one because I'm putting the guitar,
2028480	2033600	like I'm playing a MIDI, I'm playing an iPad guitar in there. The first one to me is the more
2035440	2039360	the first one to me is the more interesting musically one. Uh, like it's got that kind of
2039440	2043040	that's my favorite one too. It's got strings and it's got that weird kind of out there kind of
2043040	2047520	quality. Yeah. And it's like, it sounds a little like, like maybe it would, like the, the second
2047520	2056160	one is like, it's going straight to like aviation museums, like a tour video. I mean that I, I
2056160	2060320	flatter myself, but, but like, like that it would be used professionally. But I'm saying like, it's
2060320	2066800	not, it's not a, nobody, nobody, nobody started crying during the second one. But during the
2066800	2070480	first one, if you listened to it a bunch and if you made it, I think you have to have made it.
2072160	2077760	All right. Now play the second one, but I want you to do voiceover at the aviation museum,
2077760	2080240	even though I, you probably don't know a whole lot about aviation.
2080240	2086320	Wait, you want the second one played again with that. Uh, okay. Yeah. So like, like we're
2086320	2091040	walking under the tour of the vintage aviation museum and this is the music and then you're
2091120	2093120	doing a voiceover. Welcome aboard.
2096800	2103920	Whether you got here by car, boat, foot, or our preferred mode of travel,
2106160	2114000	you just found a second home. For the next three hours, the blinking lights on the floor
2114000	2119360	will lead you through a labyrinth of educational and sometimes amusing exhibits.
2121040	2128720	Yeah. I love exhibits. Morgan Freeman, what are you doing here?
2133120	2137520	Our lawyers require us to tell you that there are no such thing as ghosts.
2141920	2147760	If you see a pilot with unfinished business, he's probably a rapist.
2151920	2157680	Exhibit one, Kitty Hawk, 1911.
2159200	2165600	If you were getting pasta in Nebraska in 1911, you probably weren't thinking about
2165600	2171600	Orville and Wilbur Wright. Even though their father was the pesto king of
2172400	2180320	Nebraska, I think I said, those two boys had their eyes on a, whoa, a bigger prize.
2180320	2185840	Hey, excuse me. Oh, is this a tour or a fossil?
2187840	2193920	Proppy, get out of here. I'm trying to give the tour. You need to blow away.
2196960	2200560	I'll be back in exhibit three. Proppy, behave yourself.
2201760	2207280	Hi, folks. We're going to take a different form of the tour. I'm changing the blinking lights to
2207280	2216480	Proppy color. Don't follow the same old tour. You're going to follow mine. We're going to have
2216480	2228800	fun. Pizza, rock and roll, aviation history. Pregnant women should follow the emergency exit
2229520	2236800	in an emergency along with non-pregnant women and men.
2239440	2245120	Sorry, my wife is currently pregnant and I, at the time of recording this, by the time you're
2245120	2249760	hearing it, my kid's probably eight years old. I'm not even part of the tour. I'm just the
2249760	2265120	emergency exit speaker. Exhibit two. Oh, Cloris, pass me that butter, Chan. No, Einstein.
2266800	2277840	What are you going to do with it? More mathematics? Oh, it's a living in the 1936s.
2280400	2287600	Gravity was only on a few people's mind, even though the planes that were working.
2288880	2290480	You know what? Sorry, I got to go.
2294160	2302800	Hey, man. Hey. Hey. Yeah. What? What? Wait. Come over here, man. I'm over here. I was sleeping over
2302800	2318320	here. Touch this. Touch this. I'm Amelia Earhart. Touch it. Touch my dick. Okay. You were warned.
2319120	2326960	Yeah. Before you put it away, are we going to do that second thing?
2327840	2332400	Oh, yeah. The second thing, we're going to do the first one, but that one needs like some
2332400	2337600	Leonard Cohen lyrics to it. That's got some, that's got some angular like soul to it.
2337600	2341440	Yeah. I really feel like I could, yeah. That should be the album title.
2341440	2346560	Angular Soul. Angular Soul. On Fantabulon Records.
2348160	2351680	Well, you know, I don't, I don't know if I have the lyrical gumption. You're going to make up lyrics
2351680	2357920	for it. No, you're going to. I mean, we can all do it, but let me hear it through.
2362400	2367360	Yeah, that word. That's what I want.
2370160	2372480	I adjusted the velocity of some of the things like,
2373520	2375760	you're laying it down, you know, because you're mad at your dad.
2377760	2380080	All right. That's, that's the title of the song.
2381920	2385920	So mad at my dad. So mad at my dad.
2386800	2390640	So mad at my dad. My mom too.
2392320	2398320	I also have that entire pedal next to you. Oh, yeah. The robot voice.
2398320	2402640	Oh, yeah. Well, I don't know. I think I want to do the heavy lifting. I can't,
2402640	2406080	I don't know. Let's let's play again. And now that, yeah, yeah, let's let's,
2406080	2409280	we're not familiar with what you're going to take a first pass. Yeah. Like what's,
2409360	2414000	what's it about though? Like, what's, what's Liz do it? Do you want me to give you a suggestion
2414000	2419360	and you're going to improvise lyrics? No, I know. I have written down lyrics to your song.
2419360	2423760	Whoa. Why don't you just read them? Do you want me to give you a silly suggestion or like,
2423760	2428160	uh, like, uh, tell me what you think that music like lends itself to
2429280	2433440	titually. And I'll, and I'll try my worst to, uh, to make it good.
2433440	2436880	All right. When I, when I hear this song, I think about,
2437040	2451040	uh, concrete, uh, uh, dead leaves. Okay. Uh,
2457040	2459760	they agrees. It's official.
2459760	2464000	So far the dry, the dry, the dry leave, uh, dry, dry leave lobby is here.
2464960	2466880	A concrete and dead leaves so far, right?
2469040	2471520	To me, it's like nervous that I was going to have to come up there.
2471520	2476400	It's like someone angry who's like, uh, on a, on going on a tear, like someone who's going on a
2476400	2482720	rant. This is the song. Yeah. Because it's like, it has this driving like kind of bounciness to it,
2482720	2487760	but then the discord that notes and stuff kind of like, they imply like a anger.
2487760	2490800	Spencer, I don't want to put you on the spot. Would you, would you, would you try singing one?
2490800	2494640	Oh, okay. No. I mean, I'll do some of it, but you guys have to help.
2494640	2497760	No, I mean, it's like, you, you, you, you're coming in with more like,
2497760	2501840	Oh yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm the master. Let's do it.
2501840	2504640	So we got concrete and dead leaves. Anything else, Harmon? Like, what, what,
2504640	2509760	what else does it, does it talk to you? Uh, you know, just down a little, I think.
2509760	2512240	All right. We've got to rob shrub in the house.
2512240	2515520	It's good. This is good. No, I don't want to over labor it. Let's, uh,
2515520	2519520	let's see what we got. Concrete and dead leaves. Oh, Spencer, why don't you, why don't you drive?
2519520	2521520	Okay.
2526400	2534640	I can't take this anymore. My dad, he is killing me.
2536560	2548640	Concrete dry leaves. I can't break any of these. I will not do this chore.
2549600	2565440	My dad will ask me no more. These damn leaves and my goddamn father leaves.
2565440	2566960	Yeah. I don't know.
2570800	2575360	See, you see how I had something for a little bit and then if someone really took it,
2575360	2577520	it would have just seemed like I was a real genius.
2578240	2581360	Well, no, but then you started to say that Brandon and I should,
2581360	2585360	Brandon and I should have come in on a harmonic and a harmonic kind of backup vocal.
2585360	2588320	I didn't mean that as a, no, I just meant as like how good I did.
2588320	2592480	No, you killed, you fucking, you destroyed it. It was, oh yeah. No, everyone loves me.
2592480	2597760	I heard the part where you, you knew you were killing it and then you had to wonder like, oh,
2598720	2602160	am I supposed to bring it into the station? Like, like, as far as like, like,
2602160	2606080	is it going to end soon? And then that, that had that through you.
2606080	2609680	I certainly was done at a point and yet the music played.
2611200	2614320	Wow. That was, that was, that was good. I never, I mean, that's, that's,
2614320	2615600	that's the magic of collaboration.
2615600	2617520	Do you want to, do you want to try one of them? Like the same song,
2617520	2621520	but I'll give you a suggestion that like, I'll like kind of give you a poetical
2622960	2625840	idea for you to sing to that melody.
2625840	2626240	Okay.
2626880	2628880	All right. Make your cocktail.
2629840	2630720	What are you drinking there?
2630720	2636000	You get two guesses, audience.
2641520	2642320	I think it's kettle.
2642320	2645680	All right. So Dan, same melody. Let's do,
2648800	2655360	I've been on the road a lot and there's this repetition that happens of going
2655360	2659600	from hotel to hotel to theater to hotel to hotel to theater to hotel.
2659600	2665680	And there's a moment of amnesia that happens where you wake up
2666240	2671280	and your eyes are still closed and you're not totally sure what room you're in.
2671280	2674480	Are you at home? Are you on the road? And if you're on the road,
2674480	2676800	what possibly, when you opened your eyes, would you see?
2677760	2678800	Okay. Okay.
2678800	2679600	Right. Yeah.
2680640	2687040	That's cool.
2689600	2696000	I don't know what room I'm in.
2697360	2702640	I don't know what state I'm living in.
2702640	2711680	I wanted to do more improv on airplanes, hotels, theaters, theaters, hotels, airplanes, airplanes.
2711680	2720800	I just want my mommy back. I just want my lover in me.
2729200	2730800	These are the struggles on the road.
2730800	2731760	Jeff.
2732080	2732720	Jeff.
2739360	2742160	You just miss me when I'm on the road because you want me inside you.
2742160	2742400	Yeah.
2744160	2745360	All right, Brandon, your turn.
2745360	2746080	Oh, brother.
2747360	2751840	Dan, lay a title on Brandon. Church, you want to do one too? You're a singer.
2752800	2753600	Church loves you.
2755120	2755600	Nope.
2758000	2760640	Well, all right. Yeah. You want a suggestion?
2760960	2761440	Sure.
2766080	2766800	Thanksgiving.
2767600	2767920	Okay.
2769280	2770160	You ready?
2770160	2771440	People like that suggestion.
2771440	2773440	Yeah.
2790640	2795920	Oh, grandpa dead at the foot of the table.
2797440	2798640	Gravy hot.
2798640	2799600	Nothing. I'm big.
2799600	2801440	White able.
2816880	2818960	Did grandpa leave a foot at the table?
2819680	2822800	He was dead. He was dead. He was dead at the foot of the table.
2822800	2827040	At the foot. I thought he left a foot. I was like, well, did he die last year?
2827040	2831360	And there's just, I thought it was like a Thanksgiving, not your Thanksgiving.
2833920	2834880	Davis, bring us home.
2834880	2837120	We're all going to, we're going to go around the room and all of us are going to do one.
2837920	2838640	That could be good.
2839920	2840800	I'll try one.
2840800	2841520	Okay, Jeff.
2845520	2846800	I can't follow Turkey soon.
2847760	2848880	And yet you must.
2851200	2852880	Spencer, give Jeff a suggestion.
2852880	2854160	Spencer, you like.
2854160	2857120	Um, like if you go to the Google headquarters and stuff,
2857120	2861600	they have like all these cafeterias that have private chefs and it's just awesome.
2861600	2862640	It's like a wonderland.
2864000	2865120	Does that, is that something?
2867360	2868560	It's something.
2872000	2874240	Google office catering wonderland.
2874240	2876480	Over in Venice and you know how the traffic is.
2877120	2878640	This is an actual thing in Venice.
2878640	2880000	Oh, yeah.
2880000	2880320	Okay.
2881120	2883680	I've been there. I've had omelets.
2883680	2884160	All right.
2885360	2889120	Are you, do you go there to, wait, you just go to the Google office to.
2889120	2891680	Oh yeah. Best omelets in the house.
2892640	2896000	No, no, I had a friend who worked there and it's like a, it's, it's,
2896000	2897440	it's kind of like a clubhouse.
2898080	2900320	They got surfboards.
2901360	2905600	The Google, I went to speak at Google and they told me a story about somebody that had been,
2906320	2907760	there's just sort of living there for a while.
2907760	2908480	That was me.
2908480	2908720	Yeah.
2909520	2912800	They got sleep pods and healthy snacks.
2912800	2915440	Okay. Jeff, are you ready for your song?
2916720	2917440	Yeah.
2917440	2917940	Okay.
2919120	2919760	Here we go.
2920880	2924800	I mean, also let me know if you want like a metronome so that you can take advantage of that
2924800	2926480	wasted real estate in the beginning of the song.
2926480	2928720	Everyone has to, I'm going to dive right in.
2928720	2929360	All right. Here we go.
2930240	2934400	One, two, one, two, I can't count it off because I don't know the tempo.
2934400	2936320	It's just starting to spell for it.
2936320	2937600	One, two, one, two, three, five.
2939760	2940560	Okay.
2940560	2941200	We've heard it enough.
2941200	2942240	Here we go.
2942240	2943120	We've heard it enough.
2944320	2947600	What am I going to get the omelette?
2948640	2953680	I'm hungry and still yet I don't know why am I
2956240	2957920	Thursday's still wet
2957920	2963920	download tasty treats
2965040	2966080	Google style
2968080	2975120	I want a gigabyte of sandwiches to make me smile
2979120	2980880	right inside my office.
2980880	2982000	I want something
2984000	2985520	farmed a table.
2985520	2995360	No farm to orifice almond butter.
2997360	2997840	All right.
2998640	3001920	A little bit of Jeff Bowie in this motherfucker church.
3001920	3003600	Get up here and do when you come back.
3003600	3004240	No, I'm sorry.
3004240	3007200	That was that's fair.
3007200	3008720	It's hard to argue with that logic.
3009440	3011600	It's really scary because you got to destroy yourself.
3011600	3012400	Like right.
3012400	3013520	It's hard to sing.
3013520	3013920	All right.
3014000	3014640	Now we do one.
3014640	3019280	But the four of us, we do like a like a boys to men kind of full on like we.
3019280	3020400	Yeah.
3020400	3023600	People are saying that we're going to be real simple so that we can.
3023600	3025840	Yeah, pretty much know what we're doing.
3025840	3026240	All right.
3026240	3028000	We'll have to look at each other's mouths.
3028000	3031600	Yeah, but I would say the lights on.
3031600	3036000	Dan, you'd be like the lead OJ and the rest of us would be like the other OJ.
3036000	3038720	So you'd be the I see what's going on.
3039360	3041440	You'd be the Gladys Knight to our pips or whatever.
3041440	3043680	Like we'll fill in on this on the side.
3043680	3044400	I will do.
3044400	3046720	I will do sonic augmentation.
3046720	3048240	I want to be the Yoko Oh, no.
3049680	3050640	Oh, no.
3050640	3051200	Oh, yeah.
3051200	3051840	That works.
3051840	3052800	I'll be the Shakira.
3054800	3055600	This is going to be good.
3055600	3058560	Wait, but I'm like, wait, you'll do all the hard work.
3058560	3061760	No, no, I thought we were just we were like a group that kind of works together.
3061760	3062800	Yeah, no, we all work together.
3062800	3065360	No, no, I say we all we all help, but the same.
3065360	3067840	Okay, like it's like it's like a belt of devo.
3067840	3070160	Like, like, you know, somebody's got to do a little bit.
3070800	3071600	We could do it.
3071600	3073520	They don't just sing in unison the whole time.
3074240	3075680	A, B, A, B.
3075680	3076640	That could be easier.
3077200	3078880	Well, no, I mean, just throw to each other.
3078880	3081920	I like I like the idea of you guys harmonizing and stuff.
3081920	3086240	I mean, I say we just I just anybody wants to take the wheel.
3086240	3087040	You take the wheel.
3087040	3087600	It does.
3087600	3088080	Let's not.
3088080	3088720	Let's not.
3088720	3089200	Okay.
3089200	3091200	Let's not take it in.
3091920	3092400	Okay.
3092400	3093040	What's it about?
3093040	3093680	What's it about?
3093680	3096320	Oh, it's about let's just go from the audience.
3097920	3099120	Human man.
3099120	3100000	I like that.
3100000	3100240	Okay.
3100960	3101280	What?
3101280	3102640	Pyramid man.
3102640	3103280	Pyramid man.
3103280	3104400	Shout out to Rob Shropp.
3104400	3105360	Pyramid man.
3105360	3106000	Pyramid man.
3106000	3107600	Oh, he was the reference for last.
3107600	3107920	Oh, yeah.
3107920	3108960	Pyramid man.
3108960	3109440	Here we go.
3110240	3113600	I just want my pyramid.
3113600	3115360	Pyramid man.
3115360	3118560	I just want my slaves to build.
3118560	3120160	He's from CHOPs.
3120160	3123120	I just want my pyramid.
3123120	3124480	Pyramid man.
3124480	3128640	I just need my slaves to build it.
3129600	3131760	Took a million slaves to build the pyramid.
3131760	3132800	Dogs on top.
3134800	3135840	We got to start over.
3135840	3136080	Yeah.
3138560	3141360	First of all, I put the phone away from the mic.
3141360	3142400	Can we give you another one?
3142400	3143520	I can't do two things at once.
3143520	3143600	Okay.
3143600	3144480	New suggestion.
3144480	3146480	And then Brandon handed me a microphone.
3146480	3147760	Church, if you're not going to sing.
3147760	3150240	Church, if you're not going to sing, give us a title.
3152000	3153600	Like something kind of Nick Cavey.
3158960	3160000	Or Warren Ellissey.
3163200	3167440	How about hot dog water like a Limp Biscuit?
3169280	3169680	Really?
3169680	3170560	Trigger word.
3170560	3171440	Limp Biscuit.
3171440	3172400	Church, you got something I know.
3173280	3174080	Hot dog water?
3174080	3174560	All right.
3174560	3175600	You know, I'm just trying to help.
3175600	3176320	Hot dog water.
3176320	3177760	I'm just trying to help.
3177760	3178800	Hot dog water is exactly-
3178800	3180320	This is exactly why I left.
3180320	3181360	Hot dog water.
3185120	3186880	Gotta cook those dogs.
3189200	3191440	Hot dog water.
3191440	3192880	Full of nitrates and salt.
3195600	3196880	Basically, you brought it.
3196880	3197600	That's what you had.
3197600	3198960	That's what you first did.
3198960	3201040	But I thought we were-
3201040	3202480	The methodology is the problem.
3202480	3205600	What was pitched to me was everybody was like doing a thing at the same time.
3205600	3206800	Otherwise, why would I do a six song?
3206800	3208880	Subtly what was pitched to was you doing all the work.
3208880	3212000	Let's all try to watch each other's mouths and actually harmonize on what Dan is singing.
3212000	3214000	Dude, would you get here by bus?
3214000	3214320	All right.
3216800	3217760	It was your idea.
3218240	3220080	I mean, I thought that was more complicated.
3220880	3224080	Yeah, that's why we already did the other stuff.
3224080	3225360	We've tried the easy stuff.
3227120	3227760	We need a new title.
3229040	3229600	Australia?
3229600	3231200	No, we did too much Australia.
3232160	3232960	Capital is-
3232960	3233840	Capital is perfect.
3233840	3234160	Okay.
3234160	3234320	All right.
3234320	3236080	So we're going to watch Dan and we're going to harmonize.
3236080	3236880	Okay, here we go.
3240080	3241200	The cutest thing ever.
3242000	3246560	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
3247520	3253360	Dollar sense.
3256400	3259680	There is nothing better than an unplanned harmonization.
3263200	3266560	The music is hard because we are comedians.
3266560	3267520	Can we play anything?
3267520	3269280	I can't blame the methodology.
3269280	3270480	I don't know but that's going to help.
3270480	3273180	I pitched to an A B or no jump brand.
3273180	3275880	And then I jumped on Brandon's pitch of A B A B.
3275880	3278120	I think that might have been a bit more.
3278120	3280720	I don't we don't need to do those right now.
3280720	3282020	I think Dan was right.
3282020	3283420	And I misunderstood him.
3283420	3286480	I think it's better that we all try to really fucking.
3286480	3288420	Isn't that what we just were trying to do?
3288420	3291020	But once we're all singing, we're louder than the music
3291020	3293420	and then we can't hear the tempo or the fucking root is.
3293420	3295020	It's all over. All right. Well, I can air.
3295020	3298160	I can text you the song. Oh, hell.
3298320	3300960	Thank you. That'll fix everything. Thank you.
3301880	3304720	Thank you. There's probably no signal in here.
3304720	3307520	We should just move on to the other thing that I have.
3307520	3309720	No, we could do it.
3310720	3312660	It'll be why it'll be Bluetooth.
3312660	3314260	So it should work. Davis.
3314260	3316560	Well, I didn't air drop it yet, but I'll try that next.
3316560	3321300	I just kind of I'm like a I'm like a Gen X pre air drop baby.
3321300	3322400	It's hard to use air drop.
3322400	3324360	It really doesn't work as supposed to be.
3324360	3326500	You know, it's like it doesn't always it's not always there.
3326500	3329460	You know, that's what I'm saying. Brandon, what you're drinking?
3330260	3334300	I'm doing. I'm drinking on in the quakes. Oh, yeah.
3334300	3336360	What flavor is that tangerine? All day.
3337300	3339300	Hell, yeah. All day.
3339300	3342060	I got I got my air drops on. Do you want to? No, no, no.
3342060	3344060	No, that's not essential oils. Get the text.
3345020	3347800	There is supposed to be a. Oh, it hasn't hasn't sent already.
3347800	3350260	I'll try. I can in the meantime, I can try air drop
3350260	3352700	and there's no harm in that. Huh? Wow.
3352700	3355900	All right. If you're just joining us, it's the best podcast ever.
3355900	3357100	We can plug it in.
3357100	3359100	We can plug it in with this thing that Zach dropped off, right?
3359100	3360260	Yeah. You just give me your phone.
3360260	3362900	I can just I can just plug it in.
3362900	3366440	You got to. Oh, you can stretch the idea to Dan
3366440	3368160	or you could like pass it.
3368160	3370160	Is it an audio or is it a lightning?
3370160	3372400	Because these are one of these lightning on here.
3372400	3376500	If you need the adapter, you want the adapter, then I don't know.
3376540	3378740	We should cut this out of the podcast.
3378740	3382540	No, we leave it in the space. OK, I just just the thought.
3383020	3385720	Um, how's everyone doing? I'm doing good.
3386560	3388160	I'm thinking it's thirsty and parched.
3388160	3389560	I'm going to go backstage and grab a water.
3389560	3392020	I am a thirsty fucker right now.
3392360	3395060	Can you get me my half drinking coke?
3395060	3396060	You want to drink?
3396060	3398540	Oh, yeah, the half drinking coke of it's still out there.
3399040	3401200	I drank in half of it.
3401200	3403540	When how so when are we going to see
3403540	3405180	when are we going to see the end of your process?
3405180	3407140	Like how much longer do you have on Harmon Quest?
3407140	3411780	Why? Oh, uh, where we got two episodes left to cut
3411780	3414820	and the animation happens, I expect it by the end of the year.
3414820	3416920	I don't know if we have a date or anything,
3416920	3418960	but it should be before the next year.
3418960	3420460	I know that they are all your favorite children.
3420460	3422460	Do you have any favorite episodes?
3422460	3425260	Right. We just cut episode eight that had Jess McKenna
3425260	3428100	from Off Book the musical podcast. She's so funny.
3428140	3430240	She's so good. She was a lawyer.
3430240	3432800	We wanted to have an episode that was kind of like the episode.
3432800	3433500	Thank you so much.
3433500	3436680	We're Matt Gorley came on our podcast and was the skeleton.
3436680	3437880	Gary, the lawyer.
3437880	3439780	But we couldn't get him for that episode.
3439780	3443180	So we had a different court case episode and I was really worried
3443180	3446760	because if you guys listen to the podcast, Matt Gorley really killed
3446760	3448460	that episode and he really nailed it.
3448460	3450720	Just throw it. Is he from Orange is the New Black?
3450720	3451960	Matt Gorley. Uh huh.
3451960	3455820	No, he's from UCB.
3455820	3456800	Awesome.
3456800	3458460	I don't know exactly what he's perfect.
3458460	3459700	Matt Gorley. Yeah.
3459700	3463300	But he was he played skeleton Gary and he did an awesome job
3463300	3465580	on this on on Harmon town, the podcast.
3465580	3467680	And so we wanted to recreate that.
3467680	3470180	And then we couldn't get him booked for that episode
3470180	3472080	because I think he was doing cool stuff.
3472080	3475580	And so we got Jess McKenna and I was really worried because it's like,
3475580	3478620	well, Matt Gorley did something unique, unique.
3478620	3479960	That's unreplicatable.
3479960	3481480	How could anyone else do this?
3481480	3484560	And Jess did, if anything, like a way, a way better job.
3484560	3487160	It was she just was a tour de force and knocked it out of the park.
3487420	3488760	Holy shit. That one's great.
3488760	3490800	They're all great. But that one is the one I just did.
3490800	3492000	That's awesome. Fantastic.
3492000	3494240	Matt Gorley is my friend since seventh grade.
3494240	3496900	Oh, sorry. I interrupted applause on what you're doing.
3497420	3500900	Yeah. Matt Gorley, the best buddy from seventh grade.
3500900	3502600	Yeah. And we have him in episode one.
3502600	3504460	He kicks the season off in style.
3504460	3506500	And he was the end of the season two, right?
3506500	3508460	In the end of season one. Season one.
3508460	3509800	Oh, yeah. He's the best.
3509800	3513040	A classic season. Matt Gorley, Matt Gorley.
3513340	3516420	I walk around the house and I met Gorley and I
3516420	3518520	because we went to high school together and junior high school together.
3518520	3520840	I walk around talking like Matt Gorley.
3520840	3523280	Like I speak a certain Matt Gorley language.
3523880	3526220	Or you just try to say the stupidest thing.
3527060	3529960	But we need a demonstration before you lose your friendship.
3531160	3533460	I it's hard. It's hard to do.
3533700	3535760	But I just walk around and just think of names
3535760	3538860	because if you listen to Super Ego, any Super Ego fans out there
3539000	3541040	or pistol shrimps. Yeah. Pistol shrimps.
3541040	3542600	God damn, it's so funny.
3542600	3543840	I'm not going to try to do it.
3543840	3546800	Him and Jeremy Carter and Mark Mark McConville.
3547140	3548740	Fucking absolutely hilarious.
3548740	3550840	He's hanging out with Michelle Obama now.
3550840	3553840	He's now. Oh, yeah, he's in Milwaukee, right?
3553860	3556660	He's doing Conan O'Brien's.
3556660	3557960	Conan needs a friend or what's it called?
3557960	3559760	Yeah, Conan needs a friend.
3559760	3562000	Yeah. A co-production with earwolf.
3562460	3564360	It's not by earwolf. It's a co-production.
3564360	3566160	All right. Do we need to?
3566160	3567300	We do need to. We're doing this.
3567300	3568500	We're going to fucking make this work.
3568500	3571340	So what's the methodology if you need to get levels or something?
3571340	3572800	Yeah, exactly. We get those up.
3572800	3575640	Let's do a sound check on this so we can get this right.
3575640	3577640	That's better. A little more.
3577800	3578840	What's the methodology?
3578840	3580160	Are we going to get it in the mind?
3580160	3582500	All this. I don't know what's good for the house, but more in the monitor.
3584760	3588560	I can't take this anymore.
3588860	3590460	There we go. Yeah.
3590460	3592260	What was it? Is that good for you guys?
3594360	3595900	All right. Human man.
3595900	3597900	No, it was pyramid man. What was the suggestion?
3597900	3600100	We're going to get a new one because we're going to start afresh.
3600760	3602160	Thank thank you. All right.
3602160	3603240	So we got our levels right.
3603240	3605100	We did our sound check and now we're ready to go.
3605100	3606140	And we're going to do a harm.
3606140	3607200	We're going to.
3607200	3610100	Are we doing Brandon's idea of the ABAB kind of thing?
3610100	3611400	Are we? Well, whatever.
3611400	3612400	Well, let's just agree on it.
3612400	3617080	Meaning like so like a who's lying hoedown where I do a thing.
3617080	3620420	All right. Let's get that out of our system.
3620420	3623180	I would like to create something magical after that.
3623180	3624120	Well, we don't have to.
3624120	3625980	I just want to know on a good process.
3625980	3628520	That's all. Let's get let's do this thing.
3628520	3632020	OK. It'll help us demystify the audio.
3632020	3633560	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3633560	3635800	A blah, blah, blah, blah.
3635800	3638160	B blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3638160	3640660	I think we just point probably when we're done.
3641060	3642900	OK. All right. OK.
3642900	3644260	All right. Here we go. Easy peasy.
3644260	3646000	We'll set each other up beautifully. All right.
3646000	3648640	Oh, yeah. Hey, we need a suggestion.
3648640	3651900	Suggestion. Oh, self care. Self care.
3652740	3655380	What was yours, Madam? Self care and BDSM.
3655380	3658180	I heard BDSM.
3658180	3658940	That's what I heard.
3658940	3660480	The same thing bondage.
3660480	3661380	Domination. Yeah.
3661380	3663080	Yeah. That's that's the acronym.
3663080	3664920	Initialism. OK, you ready?
3665860	3667660	Start again, because I want to start right off the bat.
3667660	3671720	Can I give you a let me give you a little count in the just just start it and I'll go.
3671720	3673560	Give the count in.
3673560	3677460	All right. Well, but you won't know what he's earning it here.
3677460	3679860	Maybe if there's a metronome, let me just give you a little count in.
3679860	3681560	You know, I had to do it to him.
3682560	3684100	That is to say, give him a count.
3684100	3685640	You got to write me.
3685640	3687440	Thanks, Brandon. You got to write Brandon.
3687440	3690580	Yeah. And then and then we're going to keep going like round robin.
3690580	3691040	Yeah.
3691040	3693040	And then we're going to keep going like round robin.
3693040	3695040	And we're going to keep going like round robin here.
3695040	3697700	We'll just try and see what then we'll get out of our system.
3697700	3698880	Yeah. OK.
3698880	3700640	I don't know if you'll get a count in right now.
3700640	3701880	Just start.
3704220	3706580	Stop. Just no count in size started.
3708020	3711080	I I've heard it 40 times now.
3711080	3713960	I'm a professional musician.
3715660	3718160	The comedic timing.
3718160	3719660	Just start the fucker over.
3719660	3722260	I love the metronome sound great, though, huh?
3722760	3724060	That was really funny, though.
3724060	3726220	That was so good.
3726220	3727560	It's like a Smothers Brothers bit.
3727560	3729300	Yeah, for sure.
3731300	3732300	But I really meant it.
3732300	3734660	I mean, I was. I'm certain of it.
3735600	3737760	I'm a Smothers.
3737760	3739100	OK. All right.
3739100	3740740	Here we go. Jeff, are you ready?
3740740	3743240	I am one or two.
3743240	3745780	Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
3745780	3748440	I'm holding it up to the mic, but it's plugged into the box.
3748440	3750220	OK. Oh, yeah, that's true.
3750220	3751940	You did it the last time, too. All right.
3751960	3755260	OK, here we go. And.
3756260	3760400	Strapped in latex upside down.
3760400	3763900	It's the best thing I can do for myself.
3765740	3767780	This ain't no circus.
3767780	3770740	Where are the clowns?
3770740	3774680	I'm just a dominatrix dark elf.
3776480	3779800	Casting spells on you.
3780420	3783920	Hope they make you feel so good.
3786120	3789960	Discount on Elmer's Glue.
3789960	3793560	I'll inflict the pain that I should
3794200	3798400	be to the D to the S to the M self care.
3799300	3803600	Hurt myself and it ain't fair.
3803740	3807540	Follicles, follicles, follicles, follicles, make hair.
3808320	3811320	Yeah. Follicles.
3814660	3816460	All right. All right.
3816460	3820500	That was the that was the what we just did was the like the
3822500	3825600	the Leonard Cohen version of whose lines I was drinking song.
3825640	3829040	Oh, yeah. All right.
3829240	3830640	Right now, we worked it out.
3830640	3831940	Now we're warmed up. Right.
3831940	3832940	Now we're fucking warm.
3832940	3835540	And now we're going to take the full nasty plunge
3835680	3837720	into the deep end of the musical.
3837720	3839480	And I want us to sound like Bell Biv Devoe.
3839480	3840520	Yeah. OK.
3840520	3845780	We are using a track that is not reminiscent of the famous BBB DDD.
3845780	3846480	It shouldn't matter.
3846480	3849680	I mean, we've had we've had 30 more years than them to think about this.
3850080	3851520	Or we have.
3851520	3852120	What's that?
3852120	3852680	What's that?
3852680	3854880	Devo song. It's like it's just a cappella.
3854880	3856080	And they're just like the whole time.
3856080	3857080	They're like, well,
3857080	3864480	there's a thing of it if I swear I could care
3864480	3867880	because I know he told his head.
3868620	3871080	It's not going to sound familiar me doing it.
3871080	3873060	Are you thinking of boys to men?
3873060	3874260	The boys to men.
3874260	3876860	Yeah. Oh, like like what was it?
3877220	3878820	What's the song? How's it go?
3881500	3883260	God damn it. I ain't helping nobody.
3883260	3884860	No, no, no.
3885380	3888480	The end of the road is what you're thinking.
3889020	3891960	What is that?
3891960	3893360	Now we've come to the end of the road.
3893360	3894560	I will be sure.
3894560	3896300	Something with a friend.
3896300	3898800	Yeah, something about a friend.
3898800	3902700	That's actually a friend for yesterday.
3902700	3905500	What is that for yesterday?
3905500	3906600	That is shy.
3906600	3909000	It's what? That's shy.
3909000	3911840	It's all for one. It's all for one.
3911840	3913740	Oh, right.
3913760	3916300	Is that wait, you're saying that's not Belvedevo
3916300	3917460	or boys to men.
3917460	3920540	So we're we're as racist as I thought I was
3921200	3922840	on the first leg of this track.
3922840	3925900	I fucking finished photo finish with all of my honky homies.
3925900	3928600	All right. To say goodbye.
3928600	3931000	I guess today, shy.
3931000	3932840	I don't even remember that name.
3932840	3934240	That's I'm doing well.
3934240	3936540	But really, that's somebody before the boys to men do.
3936540	3938300	You are not alone at all.
3938300	3940800	I don't think they made that song, but they do a version of it.
3940800	3941800	Let's do Oak Ridge Boys.
3941800	3944840	No, that's not just play a little penis.
3944840	3948140	Play a little penis, put a lemonade on the camel's back.
3948140	3949640	I'm rocking and rolling.
3949640	3950640	Put another straw.
3950640	3952760	Incredible Hulk and a Lafferjack.
3955060	3957900	Play the music. Play the music.
3957900	3960400	All right. So we do what we're doing.
3960400	3962240	We're going to we're going to we're going to we're going to
3962240	3964140	Belvive it or we're going to.
3964140	3966000	Elvira, Elvira.
3966000	3967400	Oh, yeah, Oak Ridge Boys.
3967400	3969300	We're going to we're going to we're going to Missouri.
3969300	3972000	We're going to we're going to we're going to sound like that band
3972000	3974340	that I never heard of shy.
3974340	3975580	Yeah. OK. All right.
3975580	3976400	That's what we're going to do.
3976400	3977400	We're going to do that.
3977400	3979080	What they do in that song.
3979080	3981320	OK. But to this music.
3981320	3983820	Yes. Oh, I keep holding it up to the microphone.
3983820	3986320	And yeah, and we're going to and we're improvising.
3986320	3988560	OK. OK. So new suggestion.
3988560	3990760	Brandon. Yeah.
3990760	3992520	Well, oh, yeah, the new topic.
3992520	3997700	That's not a topic, a title, a title of a song that you factory.
3998360	4000600	Reach, reject, dildos.
4000600	4002240	No, let's get that.
4002240	4003400	We're close. We're close.
4003400	4006980	Look, it's because it's going to be this is about this is about harmony.
4006980	4008100	So who cares about a suggestion?
4008100	4009640	OK, no factory.
4009640	4012780	Thank you, madam, for having the courage to yell that out in a public.
4012780	4014880	Yes, it's fine. Thank you.
4014880	4017040	It's OK. Here we go. All right.
4017040	4018480	Factory.
4018480	4020660	But don't let me get more than three syllables out before you.
4020660	4021860	No, no, we're going to fucking be in.
4021860	4023160	We're going to be all over your thing.
4023160	4024120	Yeah, we're going to be on.
4024120	4026000	I'm not hanging out here to draw.
4026000	4029000	I don't know what you guys are talking about musical styling.
4029000	4031860	So if you were just to say like potato, what would that sound like?
4031860	4035240	Translated through the sound so I could hope to replicate it along with that.
4035240	4036680	Let's show them our R&B.
4036680	4037500	Oh, T.
4037500	4039740	Potato.
4040880	4042440	OK, yeah, I got to fuck you.
4042440	4044380	You see how good we are. Yeah.
4044380	4046940	Yeah, I just want to.
4046940	4048380	Yeah, I don't like that.
4048380	4050420	We just all. Yes.
4050420	4051920	Barry Gordy is about to come out.
4051920	4053120	Yeah. All right. Be fucking big.
4053120	4054920	No word. This is good.
4054940	4056040	OK, here we go.
4056040	4057440	Here we go. Factory reject.
4057440	4061660	Yeah. Oh, factory reject.
4061660	4063020	F.I.D.
4063020	4066420	F.I.D.
4066420	4069360	F.I.D.
4069360	4074100	F.I.D.
4074100	4075360	F.I.D.
4075360	4077200	The kind that you put inside your clothes.
4077200	4079860	I want pussy fast.
4079860	4082140	Fuck my little ass.
4082140	4083440	Stick it in.
4083440	4087060	Start slow then go fast, fast, fast.
4087060	4089360	Factory reject.
4089360	4091860	I'm getting erect.
4091860	4094000	Stick it inside me.
4094000	4097700	I don't know why somebody tried to hide me in your butthole,
4097700	4103340	but I want to come out again and go back in and go back out and go back in again
4103340	4106480	and again and again and again.
4106480	4108180	OK. Yeah, we fucking did it.
4108180	4111280	We fucking did it.
4111280	4113020	Very much like Belvedevo.
4113020	4115120	That could be a fucking record.
4115120	4116460	Very much.
4116460	4118000	God damn it. Where's Jack White?
4118000	4120500	We need Jack White or fucking Rick Rubin.
4120500	4122500	If Rick Rubin were here right now, he'd fucking go.
4122500	4125500	Imagine how many takes that shy group did to do that song.
4125500	4128080	And then at the end of it, no one knows their name.
4128080	4129540	No.
4129540	4135960	People that mistake them for Belvedevo are mistaking them for boys demand.
4135960	4137920	I don't know. Yeah. That's obscure.
4137920	4140960	Also, the fact that right now, because we're live streaming,
4141000	4145280	that somebody's already taken this into a fucking like to AMI or fucking like
4145280	4148180	Capitol Records and already stolen our song.
4148180	4150840	But, you know, I don't care because we can do this.
4150840	4153240	We could do 100 days. No, I should just step out.
4153240	4155480	Brandon's got the flavor right now.
4156680	4158320	That song.
4158320	4166160	Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
4169160	4171760	The sister is down.
4171760	4175440	The sister is down.
4175440	4178840	That that was the song you were thinking of.
4178840	4181240	Oh, my God.
4181240	4184340	I forgot were the best podcasts of all podcasts. Yeah.
4184340	4189340	I've been house hunting with Cody,
4190860	4194580	looking for an upgrade, taking my time.
4196040	4198100	That's it, that's all there is to that.
4198100	4201180	I went to another house that makes you wear booties.
4202400	4203780	But I kinda got over it this time.
4203780	4204620	Is it like JPL?
4204620	4206540	Like they were making a spaceship or something?
4206540	4208660	Yeah, I know, well I don't, yeah,
4208660	4209980	I was offended by it the first time,
4209980	4210820	but this time I was like whatever.
4210820	4212580	Why don't you bring your own booties?
4212580	4215180	You got to bring your own booties, man.
4215180	4218100	Here's the thing, so we went house hunting before?
4218100	4222700	You can't just roll up with no booties at a house hunt?
4222700	4224020	Here's the thing about it. Come on, man.
4224020	4225340	What the fuck are you doing?
4225340	4228220	You think you're going for a fucking house hunt?
4229460	4231860	No booties havin', motherfucker.
4231860	4235340	Yeah, you gotta fuckin', you don't show up booty-less.
4235340	4236900	Be like, that's our next song.
4236900	4238900	You gotta bring that booty.
4238900	4240140	I'm gonna tell you guys a couple things
4240420	4242900	about open house booties.
4242900	4246740	They're filthy, they're tattered.
4246740	4250140	That's why you got to bring your own booties, Jackson.
4250140	4254660	And 40% of the house touring consumer
4254660	4258420	is gonna put on those booties under fucking duress,
4258420	4261220	shuffle around your already dirty-ass house,
4261220	4262220	who you kiddin'?
4263420	4267700	And like, by the way, by the way,
4267700	4270300	I wanna see your backyard, bitch.
4271140	4273940	What do I gotta schedule my feet for?
4273940	4276580	I'm trying to give you millions of dollars.
4276580	4278900	I wanna flow around.
4278900	4280620	That's part of the whole house experience.
4280620	4281460	That's why you got to bring your-
4281460	4283300	When I go into the living room-
4283300	4285140	You gotta bring your own booties, you gotta bring them.
4285140	4288260	No, it doesn't, you're not hearing me.
4288260	4290820	Booties don't matter, they're called shoes.
4290820	4292900	Your feet go where your heart goes,
4292900	4295140	or you're not buying a house.
4295860	4299020	Like, they had two baskets of booties at this place.
4299020	4300780	The front door and the back door.
4300780	4304020	I went in the backyard, it was a saltwater pool.
4304020	4305540	Oh, I got the booties on.
4305540	4309340	I'm not gonna walk out to see the pool.
4309340	4312660	Oh, lest I forget, the most important thing
4312660	4316780	that you'd wanna be on my mind is my feet and my booties.
4316780	4319220	So I can put them in the outgoing basket.
4320220	4323780	I have my freedom around the backyard,
4323780	4328100	collecting all kinds of AIDS grass and dog shit.
4328100	4333100	Oh, oh no, a dirty, dirty human society feet.
4333460	4336820	Oh, your backyard's all over my feet.
4336820	4338860	Oh, and then you're supposed to go like,
4338860	4340340	oh, I'm gonna go, let's go back in
4340340	4341660	and let's look at that laundry room again.
4341660	4344460	Don't forget to scrub up for surgery.
4345820	4347060	Of course I did it wrong.
4347060	4349380	I went all around the backyard in the booties.
4349380	4351420	Everyone does that, or I was gonna say
4351420	4352860	half of the people do that.
4352860	4356300	And by the way, the other half of the people,
4356300	4358260	why are you so experienced at house hunting?
4358260	4359660	Just buy a fucking house.
4361420	4363820	Like, not the most valued customers.
4363820	4368100	You know who you want coming to your open house?
4368100	4370740	Someone who goes to so few open houses,
4370740	4372140	they don't know what the fuck they're doing.
4372140	4373100	Because you know why?
4373100	4375100	Because that motherfucker buys houses
4376060	4378900	so he don't go to a lot open once.
4378900	4379740	I wanna know.
4379740	4383740	He too busy living in them, and buying them.
4383740	4386620	Yeah, so he ain't got no booty etiquette.
4388540	4390420	That's my favorite Sir Mix-A-Lot song.
4391380	4393500	You gotta put some papers down for that booty brown,
4393500	4396300	that booty brown, booty etiquette.
4396300	4399060	I like to put that tissue cover on my shoes.
4400060	4402020	What's the dopest thing you've seen in a house?
4402020	4404540	And what's the shittiest, like, most low budget shit
4404540	4406580	that you've seen somebody try to ask for?
4406580	4411580	Uh, I haven't, I've just seen some, like, stuff
4412660	4414780	where I thought, like, we looked at a house today
4414780	4419780	and I was like, this man is gay and Hispanic.
4421580	4423380	And there was no photos or anything.
4423380	4427420	I just, like, upper, like, super upper class,
4427420	4432420	like, I was just like, it's amazing how your house
4433420	4436500	can express the amount of anxiety you're under,
4436500	4439300	even while being, like, incredible.
4439300	4442300	Like, the expression of, like, floor space
4442300	4444500	and, like, the work you've had done in your house and stuff.
4444500	4447500	I don't know, I can't, but, like, when you open the door
4447500	4449020	and going straight back to a pool
4449020	4451540	that has, like, a waterfall, like, pouring,
4451540	4453460	you know, like, one of those, like, waterfall things,
4453460	4456820	it's just sort of like, like, uh...
4456820	4458820	It just screams Hispanic.
4458820	4462260	Well, well, no, that wasn't, I'm sorry,
4462980	4466140	I hit that hot button by identifying people.
4466140	4468620	My point was that I was, like, conjuring this person
4468620	4471100	in my head because I was, like, the neighborhood
4471100	4474500	that we're in is so stressful.
4474500	4476700	If you, it's, like, these beautiful houses,
4476700	4478660	but then you're, like, on Hollywood Boulevard,
4478660	4481220	so imagine going to work every day and, like,
4481220	4486220	you're, like, 15 minutes, oh, it takes me 15 minutes
4486620	4488340	to get to Burbank or whatever, and then you, like,
4488340	4491820	your first stop is Hollywood Boulevard
4491820	4493940	where you're just, like, it could be seven minutes
4493940	4495700	before you can make a left turn.
4495700	4498180	I just, and then, so then the houses
4498180	4500620	that are in some of these places, you're like,
4500620	4504220	oh, okay, so that's, all that stress is manifesting itself,
4504220	4506660	it's, like, popping, like, popcorn inside of here,
4506660	4508660	and then I, and then I project a few things,
4508660	4511300	like, I, yes, I went ethnic,
4511300	4513700	because I was thinking, like, Catholic,
4513700	4515140	and, like, I was just thinking, like,
4515140	4517060	this person's exploding inside,
4517060	4518540	and I wonder where they're moving to,
4518540	4519540	and I don't want their house,
4519540	4521300	because I don't want to wear no booties.
4521300	4523460	Wait, this is a booty house?
4523460	4525300	That wasn't actually a booty house.
4525300	4526940	What's the, have you seen somebody
4526940	4528260	who's been trying to patch up shit?
4528260	4529580	Have you seen any houses where they're, like,
4529580	4531620	clearly off asking for too much money,
4531620	4534580	and they've duct taped, like, a jacuzzi to a back wall?
4534580	4535660	Nah.
4535660	4536500	No.
4536500	4537340	No, but.
4537340	4539260	Are people out there fairly, are they being fair,
4539260	4540420	or are they being, like,
4540420	4541900	just trying to get this money right now?
4541900	4543220	Our favorite place is, like,
4543220	4545220	has been on the market for hundreds of days,
4545220	4548940	so we keep on going, like, well, who got murdered there?
4548940	4550900	Like, what's the ghost, you know?
4550900	4553140	Like, and, yeah.
4553140	4555780	But that's, there's nothing apparent.
4555780	4558860	My house, the last one,
4558860	4560980	you bring inspectors in, and they don't find anything,
4560980	4563940	but then you still find out you're fucked.
4567100	4569740	Termites, and, I mean, inspectors can find that shit,
4569740	4571540	but, like, whatever.
4571540	4572380	Why are you-
4572380	4576180	How close, how close are you to, are you tired yet?
4576180	4577020	Are you, like, fucked up?
4577020	4578300	No, I would look for a house forever,
4578540	4580580	because I'm like, I like the house I have now,
4580580	4582180	and I keep going, like,
4582180	4583780	no, I'm counting on my fingers.
4583780	4585340	I want to get mad at my house.
4585340	4588420	If I move into a house from where I'm 46 years old,
4588420	4589900	the next house I move into,
4591260	4592540	it's not, you know, it's not, like,
4592540	4594500	overwhelmingly possible I'm gonna die in it,
4594500	4598260	but, like, if it's cool enough, like,
4599500	4600780	maybe I could.
4600780	4604340	Like, and I would like to get, like, mad at my house.
4604340	4605900	Like, I would like to experience, like,
4605900	4607060	what the fuck?
4607060	4610540	Where the fuck did I put the goddamn scissors?
4611580	4615180	How many goddamn hallways are there in this goddamn,
4615180	4616820	you know, I just want to feel a little bit of, like,
4616820	4619820	over, oh, I got too much house.
4619820	4621380	Like, a little too much house.
4622500	4623340	Right.
4623340	4625100	Do you want rooms that you don't even use?
4625100	4626460	They just, like, just-
4626460	4628420	I'm gonna use them, you know?
4628420	4629900	With VR being a thing.
4631980	4632820	You know?
4632820	4635100	You're gonna end up, that's a room right there.
4635100	4636100	You know?
4636100	4638220	Burn a room, everybody.
4638220	4639940	Your next house needs an extra room.
4639940	4642260	VR's coming, coming strong.
4646500	4647740	No, by my count,
4647740	4650940	because here, Cody and I, we,
4650940	4652740	here's our dream, this is what we want.
4652740	4655940	We want a master bedroom that we're gonna,
4655940	4659220	it's gonna be like a, it's just for us.
4660340	4661180	Right.
4662540	4663380	It's a-
4663380	4664220	So, so far, this tracks.
4664220	4665060	Yeah.
4665060	4667580	But it's not our personal bedrooms.
4667580	4669780	It's our hotel room,
4669780	4672220	where we spend all of our time as a couple.
4672220	4674140	You know, we watch Netflix in there.
4674140	4675620	We do everything that we're doing
4675620	4677820	in our master bedroom right now.
4677820	4681020	But, like, because Cody will now be moving in
4681020	4684900	with me officially, like, we want to weatherproof
4684900	4688740	that concept.
4688740	4693260	So, we'll each have bedrooms that contain all our clothes.
4693260	4695460	And I, and it has to have a bed,
4696380	4698220	because otherwise it's not a bedroom.
4698220	4700980	Like, like, like, because the master bedroom
4700980	4705460	has to be, like, a place that you're not necessarily,
4705460	4708100	you don't necessarily have to be.
4708100	4708940	And then-
4708940	4710580	Super dope to devote a part of your house
4710580	4713220	to straight intimacy and togetherness is great.
4713220	4714220	Because then if Cody's like,
4714220	4717380	oh, there's a wrapper from your protein bar or whatever,
4717380	4721460	I, like, I won't be like, oh, god damn it, mom.
4721540	4724780	Like, it's like, because when you're staying in a hotel,
4724780	4729060	it's easier to just feel like you're both on the same team.
4729060	4731060	Like, no, neither person is like,
4731060	4733580	well, I'm gonna work some shit out now.
4733580	4736260	You know, it's like you're both in this space
4736260	4737700	that's like designed for your comfort.
4737700	4740100	If I had my way, I'd be like Jackie Gleason
4740100	4741300	and all the honeymooners.
4741300	4743900	They all lived in penthouses in New York hotels
4743900	4745980	where they were making the honeymooners.
4745980	4747900	And they just lived in hotels.
4747900	4749980	And the whole top floor was their crib.
4749980	4752100	And every day they go to work,
4752100	4753940	they come back, sheets are clean,
4753940	4755180	everything's good to go.
4755180	4756020	I would love that.
4756020	4758800	Like, just a hotel living, because I'm never home.
4758800	4760380	I have an apartment that I pay a fortune for
4760380	4761340	and I'm never there.
4762420	4763260	Burglars.
4763260	4764080	Is that right?
4764080	4764920	Oh, god damn it.
4764920	4765740	Oh, Jesus.
4765740	4766580	Yeah, it's pretty fun.
4766580	4767660	Back doors always unlocked.
4767660	4769020	Just get right in there.
4769020	4771300	When that guy, like, drove through my garage
4771300	4773540	and my insurance company put me up in a hotel
4773540	4775340	for a couple of weeks, it was like,
4776420	4777300	yeah, it was fun.
4777300	4779660	I got a taste of that life.
4779660	4783140	Like, we left with a couple days available, though.
4783140	4785180	We were kind of like, okay, we can go home now.
4785180	4786660	They fixed the garage.
4786660	4789060	We were like, should we just stay here?
4789060	4791500	I guess it would be weird if we stayed here, but.
4792780	4795180	That's what we did, the Rob Shrob,
4796980	4800980	Mike Ravello's photography song.
4800980	4805980	And if I haul all of my bags up the stairs
4809980	4814100	I will bring them to you.
4814100	4819100	And if you call, you call on my bag service
4820340	4825340	because I am bringing those bags to you.
4825420	4827700	All right, all right, we're close, we had.
4827700	4828780	I'll take it.
4828780	4829620	I'll take it.
4829620	4830460	We'll get there.
4830460	4831980	It'll be so crazy when we actually learn the words
4831980	4833140	to these songs.
4833140	4835100	It's the bag service.
4835100	4836420	We can't afford that shit.
4836420	4837580	The bag service.
4837580	4839420	They're called bellhops.
4839500	4840540	Bellman.
4840540	4842780	Okay, well.
4842780	4843620	Bag service.
4843620	4845820	Look, global warming.
4846740	4847940	I think it's a lie.
4851100	4852860	This is terrible times we live in.
4852860	4856900	People are just too tired to laugh.
4856900	4858460	They're like, that might be true.
4858460	4861260	I give up.
4863620	4865900	If I talked about my beefs about hotel rooms
4865900	4867620	and little things that I say in a lot of hotels,
4867620	4869300	have I talked about the toilet paper thing?
4869820	4871980	You don't like the folding the little arrow.
4871980	4873420	And now they got the thing where you go
4873420	4875940	into the fucking tissue paper and they put a million things
4875940	4878820	and make a big like magnolia blossom.
4878820	4882380	Like there's 11 tissues that you've just handled
4882380	4884620	after cleaning somebody else's poop.
4884620	4886420	But I'm not gonna use any of these.
4886420	4887740	They're always just wasting them.
4887740	4889300	I'm sure there's a difference that could be split.
4889300	4892660	But if the alternative is that new role
4892660	4897260	where you're in charge of unshucking the fucking,
4897260	4899220	you know what I'm talking about, girls.
4899220	4900540	Then you take that off and get thrown out.
4900540	4903300	You gotta fucking claw that shit like a cat.
4903300	4904540	Have I talked about the fucking
4904540	4906380	do not disturb thing that falls off?
4907460	4910500	Most doors and hotels have this fucking smooth,
4910500	4912140	curvilinear kind of thing.
4912140	4913700	And you put the do not disturb on,
4913700	4914580	because I don't want,
4914580	4916460	I don't need the housekeeping to come.
4916460	4917980	If I'm there for two or three days,
4917980	4919420	I don't need new towels, I'm fine.
4919420	4920540	Like I need one or two.
4920540	4922060	Disgusting.
4922060	4923300	Gross, you're a gross person.
4923300	4924140	Disgusting.
4924140	4926300	Why don't you sleep in the street like the other trash?
4926340	4927540	Fucking tidy.
4927540	4930060	I'm tidy and it's called being green, by the way.
4930060	4930980	It's called being homeless.
4930980	4932940	You're a fucking monster.
4932940	4935140	And you fucking put the do not disturb thing on,
4935140	4937140	so you don't have to waste anybody's time or energy
4937140	4939300	and cleansers and water to wash the things
4939300	4940140	and all the shit.
4940140	4941460	And then you leave.
4941460	4942380	Who has ever been like,
4942380	4945260	all the hotel waters was making this drought?
4945260	4946100	Oh, for real.
4946100	4947860	The hotel's waste tons of water.
4947860	4948700	Okay.
4948700	4949540	Oh yeah.
4949540	4950380	They can't get enough.
4950380	4951700	Yeah, they fucking love water.
4952740	4953580	And you close.
4953580	4954420	They thirsty.
4954420	4955420	And you close the door.
4955580	4957820	You put the fucking do not disturb thing on the thing,
4957820	4961300	which is a round little hole on a curvy thing handle.
4961300	4963660	And you'd leave and the door shuts
4963660	4965580	and it falls off every fucking time.
4965580	4966420	Yeah, it really does.
4966420	4967260	And then when you shut the door,
4967260	4969380	it's like, is the do not disturb thing on the ground
4969380	4971180	saying please come in?
4971180	4973380	You gotta fucking check it, it fucking is.
4973380	4974940	Like just make a do not disturb thing
4974940	4976860	that hangs on the goddamn door.
4976860	4978140	Yeah, a lot of times they do,
4978140	4980420	but like then the handle designs aren't like,
4980420	4981740	they aren't like, yeah, this is good.
4981740	4985380	Also, fucking hotel TV remotes can go fuck themselves.
4985380	4988340	Forever in a day, they don't work.
4988340	4990060	It's a travel hack that you could bring
4990060	4992540	your own remote sometimes.
4992540	4994500	And then just use it your own remote,
4994500	4995620	which is a weird thing.
4995620	4996980	If I know I'm going to a Marriott,
4996980	4998020	I bring my Marriott remote?
4998020	4999140	Oh yeah.
4999140	4999980	Okay.
4999980	5001540	That's the fix.
5001540	5002380	Yeah.
5002380	5004100	I wish I could go back to that one city
5004100	5006940	that had the vending machines that were all linked
5006940	5010780	by a Tony Stark credit network.
5010780	5011620	What was that called?
5011620	5012460	Do you remember?
5012460	5013380	Denver, where was it?
5013380	5014220	It wasn't PayPal.
5014380	5016860	You could buy an account to an app
5016860	5018780	and you were just like subscribed
5018780	5021380	to all vending machines in the city.
5021380	5023140	You're like snack Tarzan.
5023140	5026340	You could just walk around and vending machines would be like.
5026340	5027180	Was it pay range?
5027180	5028300	You want some candy?
5028300	5030020	Like you can have it.
5030940	5033100	Like no transaction necessary.
5033100	5035060	Just like it's on your tab.
5035060	5036820	Was it pay range?
5036820	5037860	That sounds familiar.
5037860	5041020	Cause there's this one soda machine in Griffith Park
5041020	5043780	that uses pay range and it's, oh boy.
5043780	5044940	Sometimes I'll drive out there
5044940	5046660	just to get myself a nice Pepsi.
5048140	5050060	It's a beautiful drive.
5050060	5051700	I see a coyote.
5051700	5052700	Just to get a Pepsi.
5052700	5053540	I kick its ass.
5053540	5057860	Also, there's a new culture and hotels in my experience
5057860	5059780	is that everyone you walk through
5059780	5061980	and there's 11 valet guys.
5061980	5063020	There's 11 Bellman.
5063020	5066900	There's 11 hotel like receptionists.
5066900	5069500	There's 3000 people standing by the elevator.
5069500	5072060	And every one of them, every time you walk by,
5072060	5074260	even if you just went past them a second ago,
5074260	5076460	they all have to say good morning or good afternoon
5076460	5077860	or hello to you.
5077860	5079940	And it's like, can we just dispense with that?
5079940	5082820	Like I don't need to have to have to touch base
5082820	5086900	with 40 people every time I go this way or that way.
5086900	5088300	These are my problems.
5088300	5089340	I like it.
5089340	5092180	Meanwhile, the world is on fire.
5093940	5098300	I think that all hotels, bars should be open
5098300	5103140	from ever 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.
5103140	5103980	Yeah.
5103980	5105300	Not in Tennessee.
5105300	5107020	Tennessee, they don't even fucking,
5107020	5110020	they don't open until like never on Sunday.
5110020	5111900	Like you can't get a bloody drink.
5111900	5116740	They're like going, you're selling me a bed.
5116740	5119900	So if you're gonna have a bar in your place,
5119900	5121540	then it would stand to reason
5121540	5124980	that it shouldn't be like baker's hours.
5125820	5128700	Like your bar should be like part of the,
5128700	5130500	like you're in the pillowcase business.
5130500	5132420	You're in the toilet paper business.
5132420	5135540	You touch the stuff that touches my butthole.
5135540	5137900	Your bar should be open.
5137900	5141980	It should be the reason I don't go out in Denver tonight.
5141980	5145220	I got a hotel to come back to.
5145220	5147140	And I totally approve.
5147140	5151060	Make it all fucking card only, swipey swipe.
5151060	5152840	No one's gonna come to your fucking hotel's bar
5152840	5154920	to get drunk when they live in your city.
5154920	5157840	Stop trying to make that business happen.
5157840	5159120	It's like when you go to a Starbucks
5159120	5160360	and they don't have a bathroom.
5160360	5161800	And you're like, you sell something
5161800	5163680	that makes people piss and shit.
5163680	5164520	Have you lost your minds?
5164520	5168440	Just always have one guy or lady,
5168440	5171240	or whatever, it doesn't matter, anything.
5171240	5172080	And.
5172080	5172920	That was great, it was very welcome.
5172920	5174400	Thank you, thank you.
5174400	5175680	You're welcome is what I should be saying.
5175680	5176560	Why am I saying thank you?
5176560	5177760	You're welcome.
5177760	5178760	Look what I did.
5179200	5183960	Have a person who is there.
5183960	5188520	Like, hotels are the darkest part of your life.
5188520	5193160	They're transitory, you wake up with a head wound.
5193160	5195320	You don't know where you're going.
5195320	5196360	You don't know where you've been.
5196360	5197880	You might have scabies the next day.
5197880	5201360	Like, you're only in a hotel
5201360	5204000	because your life is like, it's moving.
5204000	5205400	It's moving, baby.
5205400	5210360	And like, the bar, like every bar needs to be open.
5210360	5212720	You need to be able to sidle up to it.
5212720	5215200	It's like, it's just a living wage.
5215200	5218680	Give the one person a living wage for two shifts
5218680	5220320	so that there's always a person there.
5220320	5221800	Yes, it's true.
5221800	5224400	Sometimes for hours on end,
5224400	5227200	no one will be there wanting to drink.
5227200	5230880	That's what's cool about a bar is when you get to it,
5230880	5233560	it's empty, but it's already open.
5233560	5236400	And there's just a creepy dude washing a glass.
5236400	5239640	And it's like the open bar and you walk up to it.
5239640	5241520	You've become Dennis Wolfberg right now.
5241520	5243200	I don't know if no one's gonna get that reference,
5243200	5247040	but Google Dennis Wolfberg or YouTube would rather.
5247040	5247880	Yeah, I agree.
5247880	5248720	Also, airports.
5248720	5252400	Airports, your bar should be open 24 motherfucking hours
5252400	5253240	a day for that.
5253240	5255840	Wait, aren't they on the VIPs?
5255840	5256680	Aren't the VIP bars on?
5256680	5257680	No, no, no, usually.
5257680	5260240	The VIP lounge is, Brandon.
5260560	5264040	Let me tell you what a VIP lounge is.
5264040	5267360	You walk into a fucking bear trap here, Brandon.
5267360	5270640	A VIP lounge is three Canadian flight attendants
5272720	5274960	asking you for eight forms of ID
5274960	5278160	so that you can maybe have some pop off vodka
5278160	5281680	with your olives six hours from now
5281680	5284080	when the fucking bar opens.
5284080	5286680	And it's not a bar, it's a salad bar.
5286680	5291680	But VIP lounges can orally minister my privates.
5300240	5302520	Can I get an amen?
5302520	5303360	We'll get back to that.
5303360	5304520	Can I get an amen?
5304520	5308200	If any of you all hear in the crowd
5308200	5312280	or anyone that listens to us over the listener thingies,
5313400	5316240	if you ever fly out of Burbank and it's an early flight,
5316240	5319440	I almost hate to tell you this.
5319440	5321400	The only thing I like about Guy Fieri
5321400	5324280	is that his fucking bar burp.
5325280	5327800	Sorry, La Croix burp there.
5327800	5329880	La Croix, how do you say it?
5329880	5331600	Sure.
5331600	5333080	Or is it Guy Fieri?
5333080	5333920	Is he French at the time?
5333920	5336280	Oh, it's Guy Fieri or Fieri.
5336280	5337880	Right, because it's Guy de Maupassant,
5337880	5339920	but it's Guy Fieri.
5339920	5340840	This one is.
5340840	5344760	So the guys, both terminals
5344760	5348320	and the two little tiny terminals at the Burbank Airport
5348320	5351240	have guys, they're open at seven
5351240	5353480	and they fucking serve booze.
5353480	5355160	And they have Fernet Branca.
5355160	5358200	And if you get a Bloody Mary, say no garnish.
5358200	5359320	Because if you get it with garnish,
5359320	5360200	there's no alcohol in it
5360200	5362880	because there's 9,000 things inside it.
5362880	5366400	So that's what I will give to you or Harmontown listeners.
5366400	5368560	If you fly out of Burbank, go straight to Guy's,
5368560	5372280	crack a don, it's open and you can get fucking wasted.
5372280	5373840	And I wouldn't eat the food
5373840	5375640	because you're probably going to have popcorn shrimp
5375640	5376920	and someone's going to yell at you
5376920	5379080	and have spiky blonde hair.
5379080	5379920	That's great fun.
5379920	5382600	Some people don't understand the point of a bar.
5382600	5384080	If you watch The Shining.
5387360	5389400	Hear him out, everybody.
5389400	5390240	Let the man talk.
5390240	5393000	When Mr. Shining.
5394640	5395600	JL Shining.
5395600	5399880	Jack Torrance goes to the bar.
5400760	5404400	That's the, and he has a conversation with the British guy
5404400	5407400	and then he's like, I don't know where that is.
5407400	5410280	And the British guy's like, but you've always been here
5410280	5411120	and you'll always be.
5411120	5413680	It's like, that's, I always, when I watch that,
5413680	5415720	I'm like, I'm thirsty.
5415720	5417400	Yeah, I know it's supposed to be creepy,
5417400	5419240	but it's like, that's the, you know,
5419240	5423000	the bars are supposed to be, it's supposed to be about,
5424720	5428920	it's like a self-imposed,
5428920	5430880	one of those things,
5430880	5432480	what do they call those things in the center
5432480	5434920	of like a Puritan town where you put your hands
5434920	5435760	and your head stuck.
5435760	5437120	A stock of pillory.
5437120	5442120	It's like a, yeah, it's like a self-imposed stock.
5442160	5443000	Pillory.
5443000	5444520	Pillory, yeah.
5444520	5449520	You go like, I'm gonna, I'm a bad person.
5449720	5450960	I'm in a dark place.
5450960	5453360	I'm never going to be in a light place.
5453360	5457640	And then you go to the bar and then you park it
5457680	5461760	and then you like, you wind down the gears
5461760	5465240	that would otherwise, you know, who knows what they would do.
5465240	5466760	We don't even know.
5466760	5468200	Thank God for bars.
5468200	5469040	There's none.
5470160	5471320	We're all doomed.
5471320	5473640	I feel like the rustic and you rustic
5473640	5477400	in the old drawing room, like that's the bar from,
5477400	5478240	we don't shut them out.
5478240	5479080	Do we not shut them out?
5479080	5480760	No, rustic is dumb.
5480760	5481600	Okay.
5481600	5482440	Damn.
5482440	5484520	They got good wings though.
5484520	5485760	You guys have those wings?
5485760	5487680	But I feel like those places are like,
5487680	5491360	that is kind of the creepy bar where you feel at home.
5491360	5492960	What's going on with this place next door?
5492960	5494840	Are they going to be, they were open before the show.
5494840	5496840	Are they going to be open after the show?
5499240	5500080	I'm sure they are.
5500080	5500920	It's too bright.
5500920	5502640	It's catching them when they're open.
5502640	5505040	We've been trying to coordinate a thing where,
5505040	5506800	I know it was like, there was a, is it,
5506800	5509000	but do you know if they're going to be open?
5509000	5510280	Okay.
5510280	5511120	God dammit.
5511120	5512680	Steve might know.
5512680	5513800	Steve Levy might know.
5513800	5515120	Why are you so happy?
5515160	5517960	So you're so happy that you're excited to.
5519960	5520800	Yeah.
5520800	5522160	Cause I know in the past,
5522160	5523720	they've been trying to coordinate a thing
5523720	5526920	where we all go over there afterwards or whatever.
5526920	5527760	Yeah.
5527760	5529240	Cause now we're not drawing room adjacent anymore.
5529240	5531080	Cause there's no place to go over here.
5531080	5532800	Anyone ever goes to Vegas and people talk shit
5532800	5534680	about going to Vegas because it's,
5534680	5536360	Vegas can be a nightmare.
5536360	5538600	There's a little bar way off this trip
5538600	5540560	called Champagne's Cafe.
5540560	5542320	It used to be called Tony's Champagne's Cafe.
5542320	5543640	I think it's just called Champagne's.
5543640	5547760	And it's like the drawing room and it's 24 hours a day.
5547760	5551120	And it's always just chill and it's fucking great.
5551120	5552680	It's like, like you walk in there,
5552680	5554000	you can go in there at 4 a.m.
5554000	5557600	And it's just like, there's eight people there.
5557600	5559040	It's not ever crazy.
5559040	5559880	I love it.
5562040	5564480	Or the double down if you want to really get it on.
5565480	5566320	The double down,
5566320	5568320	tell the story about going into the double down saloon
5568320	5569160	in Vegas.
5569160	5570560	Anybody?
5570560	5572040	One person raised their hand.
5572040	5572880	Yeah.
5573000	5574000	Instead of clapping.
5574000	5574840	I like that choice.
5574840	5577400	It's a 24 hour dive bar.
5577400	5580240	I went in there one time like at like 3 or 4 a.m.
5580240	5583080	by myself in a suit, sat down at the bar.
5583080	5584120	I'm like, this is gonna be a bummer.
5584120	5585160	I've been here a hundred times.
5585160	5586320	It's always been fun.
5586320	5588320	This is gonna be the one night where it's gonna just
5588320	5589160	like suck ass.
5589160	5591360	It's graffiti and there's like punk rock music
5591360	5594120	and it's, the men's room is really just terrible.
5594120	5595440	It's like, we're being like,
5595440	5597720	like episode of like locked up abroad.
5598720	5602920	And a dude comes in and he's driven in a Bentley.
5602920	5606280	He looked like Daniel Craig, but like a little heftier.
5606280	5607240	Oh, Robert Kraft.
5609840	5610760	Too soon.
5610760	5615040	And he comes in with a bunch of great looking girls.
5616000	5618760	Puts a bunch of hundreds on the bar.
5618760	5621720	Bag of, a sandwich bag of cocaine.
5621720	5623720	A Ziploc bag of coke.
5623720	5626960	And just passes out.
5627120	5627960	What?
5629280	5630680	He thought it was the police station.
5630680	5631680	No, no, no.
5631680	5633080	He walked in and he goes like,
5633080	5634080	this is money for them.
5634080	5634920	Here's all the coke.
5634920	5637560	I'm gonna fucking take a little nappy time.
5637560	5638720	And he's like, boom.
5638720	5641040	And he's wearing a fucking bitching suit.
5641040	5644240	And outside he had like a Bugatti or a Bentley.
5644240	5645600	Something awesome outside.
5645600	5647000	And there's like, with four or five,
5647000	5648720	just like screaming hot girls.
5648720	5651520	And the bartender very casually just took the coke
5651520	5652600	and put it behind the bar.
5652600	5653440	Took the money.
5653440	5654280	He's like, what would you like?
5654280	5655120	And they all ordered drinks.
5655120	5655960	There's a corking fee.
5656440	5657520	Exactly.
5657520	5659800	And then there was only like maybe
5659800	5661400	before they had all walked in,
5661400	5663480	there was probably six other people at the bar.
5663480	5667280	It's a kind of like a square kind of horseshoe shaped bar.
5667280	5668920	And if that makes sense.
5668920	5672280	And he, a few minutes later,
5672280	5673960	poured all the drinks and then gave everybody
5673960	5678080	a black cocktail napkin with a giant rail of coke on it.
5678080	5680280	And put it all out for everybody at the bar.
5680280	5685280	Me, that guy over there, that lady over there.
5685360	5686400	All the girls.
5686400	5688800	And like, I'm talking about like
5688800	5691800	a golf pencil size rail of coke.
5693240	5694520	And it was for everybody.
5694520	5695360	Yeah, I'm sure.
5695360	5697800	So the guy's just fucking fast asleep right next to me.
5697800	5698680	And we have a good time.
5698680	5700400	And he wakes up about like two hours later.
5700400	5702320	We're all having the time of our lives.
5702320	5705800	And he goes, all right, let's go back to my place then.
5705800	5707280	And we all get into cars.
5707280	5709520	Wait, now you're with the guy?
5709520	5712000	He went with, you're with Rip and Winkle?
5712000	5716520	He needed his fucking Daniel Craig, James Bond.
5716520	5719280	You like inserted yourself into his memento movies.
5719280	5722480	I was simply sitting at the seat next to where he sat down.
5722480	5724400	And this all played out.
5724400	5725560	And then we went to his crib.
5725560	5726400	Did you?
5726400	5727240	Yeah, but that's the part that I'm saying.
5727240	5728560	Like, yeah, you would.
5728560	5730120	He invited everybody there.
5730120	5731200	Because there was like eight of us.
5731200	5732160	And he goes like, all right, fucking,
5732160	5733240	we're going back to my place.
5733240	5734600	Let's have a good time.
5734600	5735440	And you're like.
5735440	5736280	And he gets it as Bentley.
5736280	5737400	That's when I realized he's driving
5737400	5740360	like a $400,000 car outside.
5740360	5741560	You had me at driving.
5742560	5743600	What does he do?
5743600	5745000	He's the guy that was asleep.
5745000	5745800	He took a nap.
5745800	5747320	He's too drunk to be awake.
5747320	5749080	No, he was tired, Dan.
5749080	5749880	And now he's awake.
5749880	5750720	And now he's ready to drive.
5750720	5751920	So now we all fuck off to his place.
5751920	5752880	It's like a respawn.
5752880	5755720	And it's like, I don't know, like five or six minutes
5755720	5756920	off the strip.
5756920	5758080	We get into the place.
5758080	5759480	It's a penthouse.
5759480	5760400	And I'm not joking.
5760400	5761880	This sounds like one of those Jeff Davis stories
5761880	5764040	that people are going to say didn't happen.
5764040	5765960	Oh, does it?
5765960	5768720	He had an indoor pool and an outdoor pool
5768720	5770680	on the roof of the goddamn building.
5770760	5772960	His place was the entire roof of a building.
5772960	5776760	And there was a pool the size of the stage.
5776760	5778400	And then an outdoor pool.
5778400	5783400	And we just fucking did blow and drank until noon.
5783400	5786920	And I don't know his name.
5786920	5787960	Why didn't you ask?
5792960	5795200	I think he composed for Black Panther.
5795200	5796680	No.
5796680	5799400	He was certainly wealthy.
5799400	5801280	But I'm saying, that's a good bar.
5801280	5803960	The drawing room at 3 AM.
5803960	5806240	The drawing room just, I went another time to the drawing
5806240	5806760	room.
5806760	5807680	Another drawing room.
5807680	5808560	Double down, I mean.
5808560	5809560	The double down in Vegas.
5809560	5810560	I went in there again.
5810560	5811080	3 AM.
5811080	5812840	You want to let the bar marinate.
5812840	5814440	Don't go there before midnight.
5814440	5817680	Go there after 2 o'clock after the bands are done.
5817680	5819120	I went in there, sat alone.
5819120	5821160	Again, this is not going to be fun.
5821160	5824920	Like 20 roller derby lesbians came in.
5824920	5826280	And they were selling t-shirts.
5826280	5828760	And they just were harassing me and mad at me.
5828760	5831160	Because I was like a straight guy.
5831160	5833960	And they were just talking shit and just throwing ice cubes
5833960	5834760	at me, whatever.
5834760	5835840	This is in Nevada?
5835840	5837200	Yeah, this is Las Vegas.
5837200	5840560	It's a town in Nevada.
5840560	5841520	I don't know why.
5841520	5842880	I'm a fed.
5842880	5843840	Was this in Nevada?
5843840	5844360	No.
5844360	5844840	No.
5847840	5850960	Weenie is snitching, though.
5850960	5851560	It's important.
5851560	5853720	Was it in Nevada?
5853720	5856600	All we have to do is track down a house with two pools in it.
5856600	5859360	And this motherfucker going to jail.
5859360	5860760	It's a bar in Logan, Utah.
5860760	5865240	No, it's a bar in between the hard rock and the airport.
5865240	5866360	You could walk to either.
5866360	5868200	I thought it might have been a drawing group.
5868200	5869000	Yeah, the double down.
5869000	5871040	We lost Dino for two days there once.
5871040	5871880	We didn't lose him.
5871880	5873560	We went somewhere other than there.
5873560	5875000	And when we came back, he was there.
5875000	5876760	We called up Dino like, Dino, where are you?
5876760	5879320	And he goes, I'm still here.
5879320	5881240	I'm ugly.
5881240	5884360	And he was just crying at the bar because he was ugly.
5885240	5890080	You've been at a bar for 48 hours.
5890080	5893160	So all these roller derby lesbians
5893160	5895880	from whatever Vegas team, maybe they're from out of town.
5895880	5898480	There was a tournament, whatever.
5898480	5899520	I bought a t-shirt.
5899520	5901120	Then we were friends.
5901120	5907000	I woke up at the fucking Mandalay Bay, or where the fuck
5907000	5907640	was I standing?
5907640	5908880	In the shark tank.
5908880	5913080	I woke up at the Mandalay Bay, and they were all there.
5913080	5916480	I was covered in roller derby lesbians.
5916480	5917240	I was Hugh Hefner.
5917240	5919960	If Hugh Hefner was into not getting laid,
5919960	5922520	there was just a bunch of drunk lesbians on top of me.
5922520	5923840	And they got up in the morning.
5923840	5925720	We all had breakfast together, and it was the fucking best
5925720	5926240	time.
5926240	5928720	Again, double down saloon.
5928720	5931440	Best bar in the world.
5931440	5935840	Why did we not put all of that in the song?
5935840	5938080	I went into the fucking men's room one time,
5938080	5939720	and it was bad.
5939720	5941960	I'll just start the story by saying, in the men's room,
5942000	5946400	it was exceptionally unclean.
5946400	5948560	And I used the ladies' room instead.
5948560	5951360	And I come out, and a tough little punk rock chick
5951360	5954920	with a wife beater on, half my height, she's like,
5954920	5956880	you motherfucker, you don't get to fucking use
5956880	5957640	the ladies' room.
5957640	5959080	You get your own fucking ladies' room.
5959080	5960760	And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
5960760	5961640	She's screaming at me.
5961640	5963360	She wants to fucking punch me.
5963360	5965080	And I said, hang on, hang on.
5965080	5967240	And I open up the men's room, and there
5967240	5972160	is an inch and a half of brown poop water on the floor.
5972160	5974960	And she goes, oh, I'm so sorry.
5974960	5977960	Can I buy you a drink?
5977960	5979880	She thought you were just like, I mean,
5979880	5983160	did she think your threshold was just not high enough?
5983160	5985680	Or just taking advantage of a, like, the women's rooms
5985680	5987000	are normally nicer than the women's rooms.
5987000	5988560	Yeah, like someone was in there, and you just
5988560	5989720	hopped into the women's room.
5989720	5992480	Yeah, I know, I'm just kind of wondering what her,
5992480	5995440	if you open the door, and it was like a regular men's room,
5995440	5998800	which is also disgusting, if she would have been like, no,
5998800	5999480	that's the point.
5999480	6002360	I know why you used the women's room, and you're cheating.
6002360	6006400	But because there was actual doo-doo, she's like, oh.
6006400	6008720	But that's sort of a fascinating thing,
6008720	6011840	because it's kind of like, if we have any deal breakers,
6011840	6014160	can we get some bathroom police in this place?
6014160	6016400	I was sitting there playing pool, and the pool tables,
6016400	6018560	they have sand traps and water hazards on them.
6018560	6021840	They're the worst pool tables of all time.
6021840	6024520	They're the most lopsided pool tables of all time.
6024600	6027080	And I was playing with these two gals and friends of mine,
6027080	6029520	and there was these big biker dudes at the bar,
6029520	6031760	like Hell's Angels looking guys.
6031760	6036280	And there was four or five people, like three girls,
6036280	6037440	two guys, or vice versa.
6037440	6038800	And they were sitting at a table,
6038800	6040720	and about as far as I am from Spencer, which
6040720	6046560	is like 15 feet, like 18 feet, there was a trash can,
6046560	6051120	and they had a table with like 20 corona empties on it.
6051120	6053120	And they were just throwing them into the trash can
6053120	6056160	and trying to bank them off the wall and make a bank shot.
6056160	6060240	And just bing, like this is all so loud.
6060240	6061240	Just clang.
6061240	6062520	And then someone missed, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
6062520	6064360	bop, clang, clang, clang, clang, go all over the floor.
6064360	6066160	Now there's just bottles everywhere.
6066160	6067800	And the bouncer is a big tough guy,
6067800	6070640	and all the bikers just keep looking over the shoulder,
6070640	6071600	kind of rolling their eyes.
6071600	6075800	And they're just throwing glass, like across the room,
6075800	6079080	and missing half the time, and making a ton of noise.
6079080	6080640	And finally, one breaks.
6081600	6087760	And the big old gray bearded duck dynasty looking bouncer.
6087760	6093600	The biker whose street name is Caveman.
6093600	6094600	Or duty.
6094600	6095880	Socrates.
6095880	6101400	So yeah, he gets up and he just kind of reluctantly walks over
6101400	6104800	and he goes, your taxi's outside.
6104800	6107520	Oh, shit, Socrates.
6107520	6109480	Like not fuck you, you're thrown out.
6109520	6111120	We called you a car.
6111120	6112720	And the people were like, thank you.
6112720	6114560	We've been throwing bottles for 20 minutes.
6114560	6115680	That's very nice of you.
6120480	6124760	It's hard to get thrown out of the double down.
6124760	6127720	And just when they're about to throw you out,
6127720	6128960	all you got to do is double down.
6128960	6131800	Yeah, there's a bunch of signs.
6131800	6136000	One sign says, you puke, you clean.
6136000	6139120	And if you puke, they give you the fucking mop
6139240	6141040	and the rag and the thing, and you got to clean it up.
6141040	6144880	But at the sign next to it, it says, $20 puke insurance.
6144880	6146600	Which if you think you're going to puke,
6146600	6148360	or you think your friend's going to puke,
6148360	6150880	you can buy $20 insurance.
6150880	6154800	And if your friend pukes or you puke, the bar cleans.
6154800	6157400	Does the price go up if you didn't buy it before?
6157400	6160520	No, it's like insurance on a bet in blackjack.
6160520	6164080	Well, I'm saying, if it's the same price after you puke,
6164080	6165200	then insurance is good.
6165200	6168040	If you've just tuned in, this is Shark Tank.
6168040	6171040	They should charge $60 if you didn't buy it before the puke.
6171040	6172480	I think you can't buy it at the point.
6172480	6173680	You just got to clean it.
6173680	6177400	Insurance, it's you puke, you clean, as before,
6177400	6178720	if you didn't pay insurance.
6178720	6180360	$20 buys you puke insurance.
6180360	6181960	The bar will clean up after you.
6181960	6182600	Before?
6182600	6183600	I know.
6183600	6185400	But what if you puke and then pay $20?
6185400	6188360	Is that legal?
6188360	6189760	No, I think you have to clean it.
6189760	6190520	Yeah, that's what I'd imagine.
6190520	6192840	There used to be Ask Juice.
6192840	6193360	Ask Juice?
6193360	6193960	I'm sorry, what?
6193960	6194760	Stop right there.
6194760	6195960	Let's just stop right there.
6195960	6197800	There used to be Ask Juice.
6198440	6201920	There used to be dreams in the sky.
6201920	6204160	Pour me a cup of Ask Juice.
6204160	6205680	I will not.
6205680	6206680	Play the song.
6206680	6207280	Play the song.
6207280	6208680	Play the song.
6208680	6209160	Almost.
6211680	6213400	They used to do a thing.
6213400	6214360	You didn't even mean it.
6214360	6217120	I think it used to be the bar mat, the little bar mat.
6217120	6221000	Whatever spilled in there, you could, for like whatever,
6221000	6222880	I don't know if they've even charged you for it.
6222880	6224040	You had to pay $5 for it.
6224040	6226280	They would just empty the bar mat into a glass, and you drank.
6226320	6228320	Oh.
6228320	6233560	But now I think it's any bottle that gets below a shot,
6233560	6235440	like the drag of any bottle.
6235440	6237120	It could be vodka, whiskey, Kahlua.
6237120	6238080	That's way better.
6238080	6239680	Grenadine, whatever.
6239680	6242080	They just marry it into this opaque bottle,
6242080	6244280	so you have no idea what's in there.
6244280	6246280	And they also have bacon martini,
6246280	6248240	which is just bacon fat floating in vodka,
6248240	6252440	which I think breaks five laws, like from the FDA.
6252440	6253840	I've had a couple of those.
6253840	6255640	You've had the bacon martini there.
6255640	6259400	I think if you do an asked you shot a bacon martini
6259400	6263640	and eat a Slim Jim, you get a free t-shirt.
6263640	6265040	Whoa.
6265040	6267120	What a deal.
6267120	6270240	But if you have just one for losing.
6270240	6271720	Right.
6271720	6276280	But the t-shirt just says, the t-shirt definitely
6276280	6278480	doesn't get you anything.
6278480	6279480	I want a t-shirt.
6279480	6282120	Even people who know what the t-shirt represents are like.
6282120	6284520	I think it said something like, I drink asked you stuff
6284520	6285000	at Dublin.
6285360	6288920	I did the following three things.
6288920	6292120	What are you doing?
6292120	6296360	Yeah, I was playing pool with these two gals.
6296360	6298920	They were good looking, and they're not great at pool.
6298920	6301120	And neither am I, but I'm better than they were.
6301120	6303280	And we were playing for drinks.
6303280	6304200	She's shit talking.
6304200	6307800	And then they weren't that good.
6307800	6309160	I mean, I'm not that great either,
6309160	6310760	but I was a little better than they were.
6310760	6311680	So I'm beating them.
6311680	6313680	And there's all these tough biker dudes at the bar,
6313680	6315600	and they're the only two gals in the bar.
6315600	6317600	And all these big, tough house angels looking dudes
6317600	6319720	are up there like Mongols or whatever.
6319720	6324400	And so I go to the bar to get a drink,
6324400	6328080	and I say, and then the toughest looking dude there goes,
6328080	6331360	hey, man, what's the stakes over there?
6331360	6332640	I said, the stakes are high.
6332640	6333360	And he goes, what are you playing for?
6333360	6335080	I go, if I win, I get a kiss.
6335080	6338280	And he goes, win one for us.
6338280	6338780	Oh.
6338780	6339280	Oh.
6339280	6341640	Oh.
6341640	6343080	He was on my side.
6343680	6346400	They're like lost boys.
6346400	6347840	They're adorable.
6347840	6350040	Let's all just get in a big bus and go there right now.
6350040	6351600	All right.
6351600	6352760	OK.
6352760	6354440	Spencer, have you ever been there?
6354440	6355800	Oh, yeah.
6355800	6359000	When I was there, I ordered a drink.
6359000	6361640	And then a girl came in and was like, whoa, what are you drinking?
6361640	6363280	And I was like, that's a weird question.
6363280	6365240	And she was like, yeah, that is.
6365240	6368360	And then I told her I was drinking.
6368360	6369760	I thought I could do a Jeff story.
6369760	6372200	Wait for it.
6372840	6375680	And then she said, thank you.
6375680	6378360	Right?
6378360	6380680	Did anybody on my recommendation start
6380680	6383400	watching Love After Lockup?
6383400	6384640	Fuck you guys.
6384640	6387880	I'm sure plenty of people did, but not here today.
6387880	6389480	I listened back to my recommendation.
6389480	6391160	I was like, what are you doing?
6391160	6392840	You sound like a crackhead.
6392840	6395280	I guess I was just extra stammery that night.
6395280	6396280	I don't know what.
6396280	6400120	It wasn't really a sales pitch that should be successful.
6400120	6400880	Tell me about it.
6400880	6401520	I have no idea what you're talking about.
6401520	6402960	It's just a great reality show.
6402960	6406360	It's people who are pen pals with prisoners,
6406360	6408520	and then they're getting out, and they're going to marry them.
6408520	6411600	And it's just insane, man.
6411600	6412600	Does it often work out?
6412600	6415560	Or what's the batting average on that?
6415560	6416600	No, it's chaos.
6416600	6417440	It's just chaos.
6417440	6419000	Because even the people that work out,
6419000	6421520	you're like, that's not working out.
6421520	6424720	And then most of the time, you're like, get out of there, girl.
6424720	6425840	Get out of there.
6425840	6428320	And then the girl will just get out of there.
6428320	6431120	You're just like, get that chyron.
6431640	6435400	Give me that chyron that says that you are out of there,
6435400	6437480	that you didn't go back.
6437480	6440160	But it's various combinations.
6440160	6441560	Very interesting.
6441560	6444600	It's a very slim amount of people that actually,
6444600	6446760	the population that goes to jail over and over again
6446760	6448200	is something like 3% to 5%.
6448200	6449920	So you're watching something of like,
6449920	6452640	it is truly just a slice of life.
6452640	6456240	You will not see that sort of relationship dynamic again.
6456240	6458240	The big headline of the show seems
6458240	6461000	to be that even the sociopaths, because you're like, boy,
6461200	6463600	you're going to be knee deep in sociopaths on this show.
6463600	6466920	Really on both sides of the prison yard,
6466920	6470800	like the people who are going to subscribe to lovers
6470800	6472880	from prison, et cetera.
6472880	6476080	No wrong answers, no heroes, no villains.
6476080	6477200	But you're getting it.
6477200	6478200	Couple villains.
6478200	6480200	You're, yeah.
6480200	6483040	Well, you're, yeah, depending on your definition of crime,
6483040	6484200	I mean, because it's not a show about what
6484200	6485280	they did to go in prison.
6485280	6487200	But you're definitely watching them like, oh, OK.
6487200	6489200	You're a bad, bad boy.
6489200	6491280	The dude that shot up a house full of cocaine
6491280	6493440	and then asked his girlfriend to put a knife in her vagina
6493440	6494480	is a villain.
6494480	6496840	But the interesting thing.
6496840	6500120	That was strangely specific.
6500120	6506840	The interesting thing is just that it's just interesting
6506840	6514000	to me that the big elephant in the room on the show is OK.
6514000	6517520	None of the people, including the prisoners who
6517520	6520960	claim to understand that this happens all the time,
6520960	6524520	but they still feel this emotional attachment.
6524520	6527640	Like, if people, no one in the show
6527640	6530920	seems to understand that if you're in prison,
6530920	6532760	your entire world is a different context
6532760	6535440	and that your value system is different
6535440	6540320	and that therefore the people to whom you say I love you
6540320	6542960	and let's make all these plans for the future,
6542960	6549680	like, you're not necessarily a liar or a Superman.
6549680	6553120	What you are as a person whose understanding of life
6553120	6555620	is completely different from when you're going to get out.
6555620	6558160	They just keep repeating.
6558160	6560160	It's just people over and over again going out.
6560160	6563240	Well, think how important and how good or terrible
6563240	6566680	your love letters would be if you had 24 hours a day
6566680	6569920	for six years to think about writing a love letter to somebody.
6569920	6571760	They also very typically, they all
6571760	6577320	talk about how, well, look, they do 10 of these at a time.
6577320	6583480	And they don't necessarily equate that with dishonesty.
6583480	6587620	Like, the people on the outside are familiar with the idea,
6587620	6589120	well, I met this person on this site,
6589120	6594320	so the idea that I was the only one is not a realistic
6594320	6597400	expectation, but more importantly, oh,
6597400	6600400	that was the courting process, was winnowing it down
6600400	6602120	allegedly to just you.
6602120	6604120	But then the person will say in a talking head, well,
6604120	6607160	I got two over here and one.
6607160	6609080	It's like the interesting thing to me
6609080	6611240	is just picturing people as like vegetation.
6611240	6614240	Like, if you're a human and you're placed in prison,
6614240	6621880	and then these roots come out, these cilia, these little hairs,
6621880	6625320	and they're just looking for any kind of water
6625320	6627320	because then these stories will end up
6627320	6629240	with a lot of people going back into the joint
6629240	6631240	because they'll violate their parole or something.
6631240	6634200	And as soon as they get in there, they're calling again.
6634200	6636200	And it's really hard for the codependent people
6636200	6638120	on the way out because on the outside,
6638120	6640400	because they just went through this whole reality show
6640400	6644680	relationship where they finally figured out that, oh,
6644680	6646240	that relationship was it.
6646240	6648680	But then as soon as they figure it out,
6648680	6652480	the person's back in prison and giving them exactly the sugar
6652480	6657280	they need, which is calling them collect and asking for money.
6657280	6661280	And it's like this siren call to them,
6661280	6664120	not because they love the person that much,
6664120	6669280	but because they love the minimization of risk
6669280	6672200	that prison represents for them.
6672200	6675600	And I'm so fascinated by that, that they're outside
6675600	6679840	and they're less free romantically.
6679840	6682600	They're so scared of being hurt and left
6682600	6685800	that they have at one point.
6685800	6687440	They need barbed wire and walls.
6687440	6690200	They need barbed wires around the other person,
6690200	6692280	not because they're sadists, but because they're
6692280	6694600	that terrified of getting hurt.
6694600	6695880	And it's like, oh, you're terrified.
6695880	6697200	And everyone's always scratching.
6697200	6699200	They're like, oh, you're terrified of getting hurt
6699200	6701280	so you're with a convicted felon.
6701280	6705760	But that's how terrified you can be of rejection.
6705760	6707480	If you went to prison, Dan, let's say
6707480	6710200	you were doing a big federal stint.
6710200	6713400	And what would your role in prison be?
6713400	6715520	What click would you run with?
6715560	6716920	I'd be the fixer.
6716920	6717680	The fixer?
6717680	6721440	No, I'd be a screaming lipstick man.
6721440	6726280	Like, we all know what we would be in prison.
6726280	6730200	We're the 60% of the population that will never go to prison.
6730200	6731960	We're terrified of the idea.
6731960	6734680	We celebrate in our jokes and comedy and movies
6734680	6736880	how everyone on the inside is getting raped
6736880	6740480	and the institution likes it that way,
6740480	6743520	because we're all thinking, oh, my god.
6744240	6746800	There was a woman who got out and there's
6746800	6748480	a scene where she just got married
6748480	6753040	and she pulls up outside the prison that she was in.
6753040	6756080	And they're taking pictures of her flipping the prison off.
6756080	6758480	And there's a guard out on the perimeter.
6758480	6761480	And he's like, what are you doing?
6761480	6763280	And she's like, just taking pictures.
6763280	6766120	And he's like, don't get my face in it or something like that.
6766120	6768760	It's sort of like the prison equivalent
6768760	6773920	of trying to shoot a movie inside a Brookstone.
6773920	6775520	But it's like, he's 500 guards away.
6775520	6778880	And he's like, just keep your camera.
6778880	6779960	He said some bibble babble.
6779960	6780840	And she's like, what?
6780840	6781640	I can't hear you.
6781640	6785400	He goes, I assume you're an ex-felon, so take your pictures
6785400	6787680	and get out of here.
6787680	6792000	He's familiar with the fact that this road that he stands there
6792000	6794960	and watches, basically, it's just a regular thing
6794960	6798200	that a Camaro pulls up and a man and a woman
6798200	6803280	get out with a six-pack and pose flipping off this place.
6803280	6805800	So here's the thing.
6805800	6809520	I'm watching that and going, honey, don't.
6809520	6812440	Like, I wouldn't flip the place off.
6812440	6815920	I wouldn't be shocked to find out through the mail
6815920	6818600	a week later that I violated a finger law.
6821600	6824800	The way that we employ our penal system
6824800	6828680	is simply to say, are you capable of fear?
6828680	6831440	If so, fear this.
6831440	6833240	And then we're all afraid.
6833240	6836040	And then we have no respect for the people on the inside.
6836040	6837680	And the people on the inside are treated
6837680	6839480	like animals and whatever.
6839480	6842720	Sorry, it's the end of the show.
6842720	6843720	It's a love after lock up.
6843720	6846320	This time, watch it.
6846320	6849520	My recommendation was good this time.
6849520	6851640	It was 20% more fluid.
6851640	6855080	I'm telling you, watch one episode of season one
6855080	6858440	of Love After Lock Up and tell me
6858440	6860720	that you didn't want to watch the second episode,
6860720	6861640	and I'll be fine.
6861640	6862960	Then I'll accept that.
6862960	6868040	My new favorite thing is I got screwed on a flight
6868040	6869400	two days ago yesterday.
6869400	6871680	God, I'm so lost.
6871680	6874040	We got like five hours of delays and stuff like that.
6874040	6877520	Watching over the shoulder of whatever the person next to you
6877520	6879840	is watching on a plane.
6879840	6881320	Through the seats.
6882240	6885880	This lady next to me was watching some sort of like low
6885880	6887040	rent Game of Thrones stuff.
6887040	6889080	It was good.
6889080	6890680	It's probably better without the sound.
6890680	6892880	I'm just watching these people fucking fight.
6892880	6895400	It was great.
6895400	6896400	Damn.
6896400	6897400	So that's my recommendation.
6897400	6900440	Watch the lady up next to you on the plane.
6900440	6905000	It's called low level fucking fights.
6905000	6906880	I always get sucked into that shit.
6906880	6908320	Somebody will be eight seats away,
6908320	6910280	and they'll be watching some piece of shit
6910280	6914320	like a millennial slapstick that I saw a billboard for.
6914320	6918640	And I was like, I'm not watching fucking Bad Dog.
6918640	6920200	I don't care how many celebrities
6920200	6922480	are the voice of the dog.
6922480	6925520	But then precisely for that reason,
6925520	6927920	it's definitely a movie you were never going to see.
6927920	6929680	You keep seeing scenes, and you're like,
6929680	6932800	is Jason Sudeikis in that?
6932800	6935160	You're like, god damn it.
6935160	6937080	Because you're watching a movie in order,
6937080	6938000	you got nothing to do.
6938000	6940240	And then you're like, well, why is she doing aerobics?
6940240	6942320	Is the dog evil?
6942320	6943040	You're waiting.
6943040	6946080	What's the animated one where it's kind of like Mexico?
6946080	6948480	It's kind of Day of the Dead kind of stuff.
6948480	6953280	Yeah, I watched that over on the seat next to me with no sound
6953280	6955120	on, the person next to me watching it.
6955120	6957520	It fucking, the story.
6957520	6958360	Did you cry?
6958360	6959880	Yeah.
6959880	6961000	The story is great.
6961000	6962960	I knew exactly what was going on,
6962960	6964440	and I didn't need to hear the words.
6964720	6968720	It was like a beautiful, silent, tragedy comedy.
6968720	6970040	It was gorgeous.
6970040	6974400	You have always told me that you like your Mexicans to shut up.
6974400	6978320	That's the show, ladies and gentlemen.
6978320	6981320	What's Spanish for cliffhanger?
6981320	6983280	Yeah, I don't think I made myself very clear when I
6983280	6984720	earlier alluded to.
6984720	6985960	Oh, you know, it was fun in the house.
6985960	6988480	I could tell someone was gay and Hispanic.
6988480	6990760	I'm still going over there going, what did you mean?
6991600	6995480	It wasn't what you think.
6995480	6996400	Yeah.
6996400	6998280	And I was trying to think of who's
6998280	7000480	the funniest gay Hispanic I know to say,
7000480	7003640	but then I'm helping.
7003640	7007120	My story was me being like this Angela Lansbury and feeling
7007120	7008880	like I felt like I knew the person.
7008880	7009960	Yeah, yeah.
7009960	7012000	And that person was gay.
7012000	7012880	And Latino.
7012880	7014840	And Latino.
7014840	7016960	Because they had a waterfall?
7016960	7017520	That's the thing.
7017520	7018880	That's where I ran into trouble, because then
7018880	7020880	by the time I stopped talking, I was like, oh boy,
7020880	7025000	you just really, you really did a number on yourself.
7025000	7029640	Because all you did was say, I know a person by something
7029640	7031520	other than knowing them.
7031520	7033400	Bad move, brother.
7033400	7035280	What a dumb move.
7035280	7037960	Fortunately, we're in the middle of a podcast civil war
7037960	7042320	between the, yeah, the shit's going down.
7042320	7043560	That's car bros.
7043560	7046480	There's some crazy shit going down in the true crime
7046480	7048120	community, I'll tell you that.
7048120	7049160	True crime.
7049160	7049880	Yeah.
7049880	7051480	I mean, that's kind of the epicenter.
7051480	7054920	I don't want to dip my tender paw into it.
7054920	7058120	Wait, there's people beefing on true crime.
7058120	7059360	There's just some shit that.
7059360	7060760	Weren't there mergers last week?
7060760	7061240	Murders.
7061240	7063960	Didn't somebody get purchased for like $230 million?
7063960	7066760	Nah, I don't know about nothing about that.
7066760	7071240	Somebody in the true crime community
7071240	7075720	posted an Instagram on International Women's Day
7075800	7082720	that had this crazy kind of just white text on black meme.
7082720	7086000	That was just sort of like, what?
7086000	7087560	I don't want to editorialize any of it.
7087560	7090520	I just want to be objective and say somebody posted.
7090520	7092800	It was just such a strange thing to post,
7092800	7096280	particularly at International Women's Day.
7096280	7100520	And then there were people that, luminaries,
7100520	7105000	our friends among them going like, hey,
7105080	7108080	this podcast network, like, is this really?
7108080	7108960	Are you proud of this?
7108960	7112240	And then so then the person in particular got shit canned.
7112240	7115680	So it's just the age old now within the true crime
7115680	7118800	community, the same schism that's everywhere
7118800	7122600	all the time, which is on one side, you got what the fuck,
7122600	7123080	dude?
7123080	7124080	It's called freedom of speech.
7124080	7125520	It's called due process, all that stuff.
7125520	7127440	And on the other side, you have what the fuck.
7127440	7129640	It's called empathy, what the fuck is happening.
7129640	7132800	And never the twain shall meet, and everyone
7132800	7136600	shall be unhappy, and angry, and interesting.
7136600	7139960	Where would I go to find this all play out?
7139960	7142640	I don't know.
7142640	7144040	You can't say it, because you don't want to be involved.
7144040	7146920	You can probably Google true crime podcast,
7146920	7149680	International Women's Day, and probably find something.
7149680	7151480	Well, here's the thing.
7151480	7157680	I think that I've, my point is that I didn't want to,
7157680	7160480	I don't want to get involved as far as like,
7160480	7164640	but it doesn't mean, it's the guy, the sword and scale guy,
7164640	7166680	the Mike, the day.
7166680	7168600	Reserve, though, clap.
7168600	7170400	Reserve it.
7170400	7174080	So if you want to go look at what I'm talking about,
7174080	7176120	I'm not like, oh, I don't want you to know about it.
7176120	7180040	I don't want to stir anything.
7180040	7183080	I don't want my presence to affect anything.
7183080	7186920	Other than people to watch locked or love it up.
7186920	7188080	I want everyone to watch that.
7188080	7189160	So we'll talk to people about something.
7189160	7193640	What if shit got so wild between rival true crime
7193640	7196880	podcasts that somebody killed somebody else in a true crime
7196880	7197360	podcast?
7197360	7199480	It's absolutely going to happen.
7199480	7204240	That's the Harmon Town guarantee.
7204240	7207560	There's as many true crime podcasts as there are people.
7207560	7209120	So somebody's going to get whacked.
7209120	7213640	And it's going to be this last podcast on the left, I think.
7213640	7214640	Last podcast on the left?
7214640	7215760	Or whatever the fuck it's called.
7215760	7218520	Is it next week now that our English friends will be here?
7219000	7220480	I'm sorry.
7220480	7223680	I've mis-cued that before.
7223680	7226680	But yeah, OK, so next week, Saruti and Hannah
7226680	7230000	from the Red Handed podcast are going to be here.
7230000	7233760	I'm actually a little nervous because I'm starstruck
7233760	7236280	and I want to do a good job.
7236280	7241360	So I'll be sober and we'll just talk about true crime.
7241360	7244120	I've got a couple of cases that I don't
7244120	7245720	hear anybody covering enough.
7245720	7252000	The case of the smashed garage, the case of the drunken door
7252000	7255360	dialer, the case of the dying tree.
7255360	7258000	So next week, those ladies will be here.
7258000	7264160	And until then, keep your hair on a dish
7264160	7267600	and keep your spoons from the help.
7267600	7269440	You want to try one last go at the song?
7269440	7273000	You want to close it out with one last try?
7273000	7274800	But let's do the other one, the fun one,
7274880	7278840	the more, OK, the more poppy one.
7278840	7280360	OK.
7280360	7285200	And Dan, I want you to make it about what
7285200	7289600	you feel like the audience walks away from the show with.
7289600	7290120	OK.
7292800	7300800	Thank you for joining us here at the Harman Town podcast.
7304800	7313800	Are we ever going to play D&D again?
7313800	7314600	Cliffhanger!
7320080	7320920	Zach, put a beat on.
7320920	7321840	I'm not plugged in.
7321840	7323720	Thank you all for coming tonight.
7323720	7326040	Let's give it up for the return of Spencer Crittenden
7326040	7326800	and everybody.
7326800	7328800	Yeah!
7328800	7330040	And the answer is yes, Spencer.
7330040	7331240	We're going to play D&D soon.
7331240	7331840	I miss it.
7331840	7333960	That's all you said last time.
7333960	7335600	How about Brandon Johnson?
7335600	7336880	Thanks for having me, guys.
7339800	7341560	Mic drop.
7341560	7343840	How about the mic technique of your mayor, Dan Harman?
7348160	7349760	Zach McKeever's got the beats on.
7349760	7351120	I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis.
7351120	7351640	Drive fast.
7351640	7352240	Take chances.
7352240	7352840	We love you all.
7352840	7354800	We'll see you soon.
7363960	7372960	Did you get any of that?
7372960	7375480	It's a good show.
