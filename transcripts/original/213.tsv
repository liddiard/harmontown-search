0	16000	I sing this in the shower all of a sudden If you know the word, sing it loud
16000	22000	Get used to it Get used to it Get used to it
22000	26000	Get used to it Get used to it
26000	30000	Get used to it Get used to it
30000	35000	Make it worse, then close it again
35000	39000	For Meltdown's comics, Harman Town is now in session
39000	45000	Get used to it Get used to it Get used to it
45000	48000	Let's bring out the mayor of Harman Town, Dan Harman, everybody
48000	54000	Get used to it Get used to it
78000	85000	I get a text from Cody, Dan's girlfriend
85000	92000	Are you in Milwaukee? I'm at this spy themed bar restaurant called the Safe House
92000	97000	I'm staying at the Fister Hotel, the hilariously named Fister Hotel
97000	106000	Their slogan is, you brought her
106000	110000	You were in town for a grandma's funeral, right?
110000	117000	Yeah, my dad's mom passed away, she accomplished her mission, she was just pushing 90
117000	126000	And the dementia, which, we're learning new things about this, we all maybe have it
126000	130000	Like we all just kind of have it in varying degrees
130000	138000	But it's really kind of like the tragically typical way that a story ends
138000	142000	My parents were moving her in the process of helping her move
142000	146000	Because the dementia had gotten to a point where she really needed to live with people
146000	148000	Her husband had passed a while ago
148000	159000	And while packing, just the energy and the confusion of when you're a person in that stage of dementia
159000	163000	All of a sudden, your shit's being put in boxes and all this stuff
163000	169000	And something got triggered where she's like, I gotta check on my, I gotta get the cat from the basement
169000	171000	She doesn't have a cat in the basement
171000	177000	And she fell down the stairs and broke her hip and they took her to the hospital
177000	183000	And then, this is just the tragic ironies of like, this is just like Joseph Campbell
184000	192000	We have to accept that our lives, the last parts of them are, you can't be attached to this flesh
192000	200000	Because the way we go out is so ridiculous if we're lucky enough to make it through a healthy life
200000	207000	And just have this chassis just rust and fall apart
207000	210000	Because it just gets so, from there, it just gets so cartoonish
210000	213000	Because it's like, you have dementia and you have a broken hip
213000	224000	So then they're like, we can't give her a new hip because she won't be able to participate in her recovery
224000	227000	Because she'll forget she has a bionic hip
227000	233000	Which you need to, you need sanctions and participation in order to have one of those things take
233000	237000	She'll forget and she'll just, she'll step on it the wrong way
237000	240000	And she won't know what's going on and it'll get all fucked up
240000	244000	And it'll be a fate worse than a peaceful death for her
244000	248000	Not that that was the only thing, she was also, she went into a coma
248000	253000	But it's also like, then you also think like, oh, if she comes out of this coma
253000	260000	Then she's gonna be, with her dementia, she's gonna be in bed with a broken hip for the remainder of her life
260000	263000	Which, if those things start to heal, they heal wrong
263000	265000	And so you have to re-break them
265000	273000	And she'll be coming in and out of continuity and relearning every five minutes
273000	278000	Oh shit, I have an incredibly painful thing that I didn't know about
278000	283000	Just imagine that horrible kind of fate, which is probably really common
283000	286000	Like dementia being a very common way that we go out
286000	292000	Like just that CD skipping and that relationship with like this other really common thing
292000	295000	Which is we all tend to kind of fall off a porch and break our hip
295000	300000	This is sad, I'm not trying to bring everybody down, but if I did it would go something like that
300000	304000	But I mean, I think that's, you know, you're 25, you're listening to the podcast
304000	308000	You know, it's like the obvious message from that is Carpe Diem
308000	312000	And like, get your licks in, place a monopoly with your family, which is what I did
313000	318000	But it was such a trip, like we're driving into town, we're like, you know, busing into town
318000	322000	We'd done a show like in Lansing or something like that the night before that
322000	327000	We're driving to Milwaukee and I point towards the historic Third Ward, right?
327000	329000	That's not what the original Comedy Sports was, right?
329000	330000	Mm-hmm
330000	332000	And not the original one, but the one that I met you at
332000	336000	Yeah, you were like around the corner from where Schwab and I did Comedy Sports before we left for LA
336000	340000	And I was like, I was saying to the guys on the bus, I was like, I was like, right down there
340000	344000	In 1994, that's where I met Dan Harmon and Rob Schwab
344000	348000	And then I got a text an hour later and you're there and you came to our show
348000	350000	And you watched me do improv
350000	353000	And I was at this restaurant, this spy-themed restaurant called Safe House
353000	355000	And you're like, that's where I first did stand-up
355000	358000	Yeah, I was, yeah, I would be like 17 and like
358000	363000	Because they have like this spy theme there that made it an easier place to be underage and do stand-up
363000	366000	Because the spy theme was like, what's the password?
366000	368000	And you're like, gobble gobble gobble
369000	371000	And so like you could kind of like sneak in with it
371000	372000	What is the password by the way?
372000	376000	They had their eyes less on the prize of like law enforcement and more on like this whole like
376000	378000	Are you James Bond? And like go through the bookcase and all this stuff
378000	381000	I had to dance around like a chicken for 10 seconds
381000	384000	And then I didn't know that I'm also on camera in the bar
384000	388000	Yeah, that's the idea there is that there is the people in the front room
388000	391000	Like they're, it's basically just like Rocky Horror Picture Show
391000	393000	Are you a virgin or have you been here before?
393000	395000	You know, it's like the password is
395000	397000	Or was when I was going there
397000	399000	I'm looking for a safe house
399000	401000	First of all, that's not a word
401000	405000	Second of all, that's what your enemies are going to say
408000	410000	If I had said to the gal
410000	412000	Because like you walk in there, there's no sign for it
412000	415000	There was me and this other woman like you know
415000	417000	Like early 30s gal walking up
417000	419000	And she's like, do you know where this place is?
419000	422000	I'm like, I just yelped veggie burger
422000	424000	And that's why I'm here
424000	427000	And she's like, oh, and then there's a girl like dressed like
427000	429000	As a little secretary and as a switchboard
429000	430000	And it's all old timey
430000	432000	And she's like, do you guys know the password?
432000	434000	It says like international exports
434000	435000	Something like that
435000	436000	And she's like, do you know the password?
436000	437000	I'm like, no, I don't
437000	440000	And she's like, well then I'm going to send you on a mission to Old McDonald's farm
440000	444000	You have to cluck like a chicken and dance around in circles for 10 seconds
444000	447000	And if I had said no
447000	449000	Like I want to go have a veggie burger
449000	450000	She wouldn't let me in, right?
450000	453000	She's not allowed to say go fuck yourself
453000	454000	No, I don't know
454000	457000	I'm sure that's a subject of every morning meeting there
457000	458000	Depending on
458000	460000	Depending on how business is doing, you know
460000	461000	I don't know
461000	463000	Maybe for a happy hour
463000	465000	I don't know if like that guy from Bar Rescue came in
465000	467000	Maybe he'd yell at them and go
467000	469000	You're turning people away
471000	473000	What's out the door?
473000	474000	What's out the door?
477000	479000	What do you see out there?
479000	480000	A street
481000	483000	A street in a city
483000	485000	Which city?
485000	486000	Milwaukee
486000	491000	The biggest cheese and beer capital in the world
491000	493000	You need to
493000	494000	I'm going to turn around
494000	495000	I've rescued your bar
495000	498000	It's called Cheese Ballers
500000	504000	Anyway, sorry, I got carried away doing observational comedy with a basic cable show
504000	506000	Were you doing a depression of an actual thing?
506000	509000	Are you having a stroke right there?
509000	511000	John Taffer
511000	512000	You've never seen Bar Rescue
512000	514000	You've got to watch a couple episodes of Bar Rescue
514000	516000	I'll give you some starter points
516000	518000	First Bar Rescue
518000	521000	Watch the Pirate Bar episode
521000	522000	I think it's in Pittsburgh
522000	523000	Is that where it is?
523000	524000	Maryland
524000	525000	Yes, my hometown
525000	526000	Wait, Maryland
526000	527000	Okay
527000	528000	It's in Silver Spring, Maryland
528000	529000	Okay
530000	533000	But also, no matter what episode you watch
533000	535000	Watch it with your laptop open to Facebook
535000	537000	And just type in the name of the bar
537000	539000	While you're watching the episode
539000	542000	Because the episode always ends with it being rescued
542000	546000	And then you go to their Facebook page
546000	547000	And there's always a blog entry
547000	548000	So here's the thing
548000	550000	These fuckers
550000	552000	They left
552000	555000	And then just blazing saddles fell apart
555000	559000	They installed some unlicensed beer taps in the walls
559000	561000	That were shaped like hands
561000	566000	Because he said that hands were an important thing with our demographic
566000	570000	And now there's just hands dripping illegal booze everywhere
570000	574000	The bar they made out of 1x4s
574000	576000	It had termite eggs in it
576000	578000	Was blazing saddles in there?
578000	579000	Is that an actual one?
579000	582000	No, no, I'm saying blazing saddles make a fake town
582000	583000	Oh, gotcha
583000	585000	They're a TV show
585000	587000	TV shows have line producers
587000	590000	Line producers' jobs are to save money
590000	593000	Rescuing a bar and saving money for the TV show
593000	596000	About how the bar got rescued largely entails
596000	601000	Making it look a lot like a rescued bar from certain angles
601000	604000	And then leaving as it falls apart behind you
604000	606000	That's how you keep your job as a line producer
606000	609000	Did I meet this person through you?
609000	612000	Is there a gay bar call blazing saddles?
612000	614000	It's kind of like
614000	616000	It's gotta be you, Dan
616000	619000	Because you're my go-to for gay bar information
619000	621000	It sounds like a rehab program
621000	624000	I forget who told me the story
624000	626000	But this guy
626000	628000	Is there a gay bar call blazing saddles?
628000	630000	It's kind of like
630000	633000	Coyote Ugly with a dance but it's all gay bar and stuff
633000	639000	Apparently it's like a huge money making enterprise
639000	644000	This guy was married a woman
644000	647000	She cheated on him right off the bat
647000	649000	But her family was the mob
649000	652000	She was straight up like mafia family
652000	654000	And this guy married into this family
654000	656000	And she cheated on him
656000	658000	But the family didn't want any disgrace
658000	660000	So the mob boss said to this guy
660000	663000	He was just telling the story to this woman
663000	665000	At another bar in New York
665000	667000	Maybe Dino told me the story
667000	671000	My wife cheated on me
671000	674000	And her father called me and said
674000	676000	Look, it's not gonna be public
676000	678000	We're not gonna talk about it
678000	679000	He cheated on you
679000	680000	We know about it
680000	681000	Anything you want
681000	684000	They gave him a bag of money
684000	686000	And said, whatever you need, let me know
686000	688000	And he goes, I want to open a bar
688000	690000	Because he'd met this woman at another bar
690000	692000	And said, I want to open a gay bar called Blazing Saddles
692000	694000	Where the people get up and dance around
694000	695000	He's not gay
695000	698000	He'd never opened a bar
698000	700000	And so he went to the guy and said
700000	704000	You can't open a bar in New York without the mob's consent
704000	706000	Because you have to like
706000	707000	There's so much money
707000	709000	I think I read that on the subreddit
709000	712000	So he opened a gay bar with this person
712000	715000	With a bag full of mob money and the mob's like blessing
715000	718000	And now he's like worth a fucking fortune
718000	721000	Because his wife made the movie based on the bar
721000	724000	No, it might not be called Blazing Saddles
724000	726000	I think it is
726000	728000	All throughout the story I was like
728000	730000	I can't do it with the perfect joke
730000	733000	It's like, Jeff, just remember you don't have a cat in the basement
734000	737000	Do I have to mention that I made this whole thing happen?
737000	739000	Well, we all do is what I'm falling back on
739000	741000	I went and saw Blazing Saddles in the theater
741000	744000	They showed it at the arc light because of Gene Wilder's sad demise
744000	748000	Went and saw one of my favorite movies of all time, Blazing Saddles
748000	749000	It was so fun to watch it
749000	751000	People that knew the movie laughing like crazy
751000	755000	Millennials that had never seen it were like bummed out
755000	760000	Because there's end bombs
760000	762000	End bombs galore
763000	765000	Yeah, I mean when I watch that movie
765000	768000	Apparently I am running a millennial emulator
768000	771000	Because I'm always like, what the fuck?
772000	775000	Like, this is like Spaceballs in the West
775000	776000	That's all
776000	777000	Anyways, but
779000	781000	Let's bring out Rob Schwab
792000	794000	Rob Schwab
794000	797000	Rob Schwab
797000	800000	He's Rob Schwab
800000	804000	He's Rob Schwab
804000	808000	Rob Schwab
808000	810000	He's the best
810000	811000	Friend
811000	812000	What?
812000	813000	Okay
813000	814000	Wait, I heard you
814000	816000	I don't know about this technology
818000	820000	Can I get a little more on that?
820000	823000	Apparently some guy named Reggie Watts knows about it
823000	826000	That's what I learned last week
826000	828000	Because I was like, I was listening to hip-hop
828000	830000	Because I was like, I didn't want to become
830000	834000	I didn't want to become like the rapping guy
834000	837000	That is rapping like 20 years ago
837000	838000	This is unavoidable
838000	840000	I mean I'm not, I was never
840000	841000	But I just wanted to
841000	843000	Your name's Dan Harmon and you're here to say
843000	845000	That you like to do a rap almost every day
845000	848000	When was the last time you listened to anything rap oriented
849000	852000	So I went to my Apple music with my little wrinkled finger
852000	856000	And I pressed play on some picture of a rapping man
856000	860000	And I listened for 10 songs
860000	863000	And I was like, holy shit, these guys, number one
863000	865000	Very sad, very lonely
865000	869000	Very emo really, I think it was what we would have called it
869000	873000	But also very auto-tuned
873000	875000	And by auto-tuned I mean
875000	877000	No autonomy and no tune
878000	881000	It's the same as with record scratching
881000	883000	In the 80s where it was like
883000	886000	Because of Herbie Hancock and the like
886000	889000	Everyone, for a large period of time
889000	892000	You had to have record scratching in your song
892000	895000	But it's like everyone has to be auto-tuned
895000	900000	Can you do share voice, share voice, share voice
900000	903000	I think what Rob is asking is
903000	906000	If you believe in life after love
906000	908000	Yeah, I mean I don't think, I mean this is a vocoder
908000	910000	I don't think it simulates
910000	911000	Give it a shot
911000	912000	It doesn't
917000	920000	Do I believe in
922000	925000	Do I believe in
925000	927000	Do I believe in things
927000	930000	Yo, yo, what do I believe in
930000	933000	Do I believe in Bigfoot
933000	936000	Do I believe in leprechauns
936000	939000	A little short Irishman that Grant wishes
939000	942000	I fucked your mama so hard she did the dishes
942000	944000	I went to the kitchen, said
944000	947000	Quit your bitch, she gonna give you a lynching
947000	950000	So I gave her a lynching, she said
950000	953000	What's this, I said don't ask
953000	958000	I went up to the attic and installed some insulation
958000	960000	Weatherproof in your home
960000	964000	Do you believe in weatherproof in your home
964000	968000	How can you proof against something that's a phenomenon
968000	971000	Older than your own species
971000	973000	Ants don't weatherproof
973000	976000	Yo, dance isn't weatherproof
976000	978000	Yick, yick, a yickety-yack
978000	982000	You fucked your mama so hard I put her pussy in a chain of sack
982000	986000	She won a three-legged race with my dick
986000	988000	At a father-daughter picnic
988000	991000	That's how hard I fucked her
991000	995000	I fucked your mama so hard she became
995000	997000	A Boy Scout event
997000	1003000	Yo, but back to the things you believe in or not
1003000	1008000	Yo, date-line Loch Ness
1008000	1011000	I fucked your mama for her dress
1011000	1014000	It was consensual, she lied to be ravished
1015000	1018000	That's what they called it back then
1018000	1021000	Ravishing
1021000	1025000	Hashtag rap culture
1025000	1028000	Okay, okay, alright
1028000	1030000	Hashtag rap culture
1030000	1033000	No, no, no, no, no
1033000	1036000	Bringing it back, taking back the night
1036000	1040000	I went on the banks of Loch Ness and studied it all night
1040000	1044000	Until I saw a little head coming out, took a photo of it
1044000	1047000	And screamed and shout, I prove it
1047000	1050000	I believe in the Loch Ness Monster
1050000	1053000	Yo, that shit was a log
1053000	1057000	It was a piece of floating wood
1057000	1059000	A cautionary tale
1059000	1063000	Those airplane tickets cost me $8,000
1063000	1067000	Wow
1074000	1077000	It's like I never left
1077000	1079000	It's like I never left
1079000	1081000	That was amazing, thank you
1081000	1086000	We have been just living in twilight until you had this thing
1086000	1089000	I have good ideas about what the show needs
1089000	1093000	I also hope we need a big screen up here so that they can see stuff that we bring up
1093000	1095000	And then we could do the whole Graham Norton thing
1095000	1097000	I could go, look at this dog on the internet
1097000	1100000	And everybody would be like, whoa, dude, we could be Ellen in a week
1100000	1102000	I want to look at the dog
1102000	1103000	I want to look at the dog
1103000	1105000	Yeah, you want to look at the dog
1105000	1106000	I want to look at the dog
1106000	1107000	But you know what?
1107000	1110000	You can't look at the dog
1110000	1112000	When
1112000	1115000	When your show is whack
1116000	1121000	Maybe that should be on a stand or something
1121000	1128000	I mean, it looks cool when you bend over like that
1128000	1133000	I don't think there's any reason to do anything but you doing that with that vocoder
1133000	1134000	I kind of did that last week
1134000	1135000	You're going to listen to the show
1135000	1136000	I kind of overdid it last week
1136000	1138000	I was working, man
1138000	1139000	I know
1139000	1140000	No, I wasn't yelling at you
1140000	1141000	Yeah
1141000	1142000	I heard it was a good show
1142000	1145000	I heard you and Andy Dick got down to some serious talk
1145000	1147000	I would like to have Andy back
1147000	1149000	Andy was very, I thought Andy was wonderful
1149000	1151000	Yeah, I would like to have him back
1151000	1155000	When he told the story about being Andy Dick at a Starbucks
1155000	1158000	I thought it was very, it was kind of enthralling
1158000	1164000	I'm out of breath from bending over
1164000	1170000	to press comedy rap buttons
1170000	1174000	There were warning signs
1174000	1177000	I got to get on that elliptical, man
1177000	1179000	Do you believe he's not in his head?
1179000	1182000	Do you have one at the crib? You got an elliptical at the house?
1182000	1183000	Yeah
1183000	1184000	You don't use it?
1184000	1186000	I'm getting around to it
1186000	1188000	I need a special outfit
1188000	1190000	I can't get on it in my underwear
1190000	1192000	You're at your own house, you can do whatever you like
1192000	1194000	You need a tracksuit
1194000	1196000	Yeah, I need a special suit
1196000	1197000	Special tracksuit
1197000	1201000	Just pop over Dan, go to Lulu Lemon and treat yourself
1201000	1203000	Even though they're sweatshops
1203000	1204000	I don't know what that means
1204000	1209000	Is that a new sponsor?
1209000	1211000	I'm sure they could be
1211000	1216000	Can we talk, I'd like to talk about something because I've done a lot of traveling
1216000	1219000	I just want to talk, I don't want, okay
1219000	1224000	The airlines, this airline, that airline, they're the worst, they're the best, whatever
1224000	1227000	All of them, all the airlines
1227000	1229000	What the fuck is going on?
1229000	1234000	What is our relationship supposed to be with that fucking seatbelt sign?
1234000	1237000	What is it supposed to symbolize? What does it mean?
1237000	1242000	Like the more questions you ask, the more data you gather, the more experiments you do
1242000	1244000	Whether it's getting up when that thing's lit
1244000	1246000	Or waiting for it to turn green
1246000	1250000	Or having a conversation with one of these people
1251000	1254000	The truth that just comes to light is like
1254000	1259000	Well, okay, if we had it our way, you'd always be sitting
1259000	1262000	Okay, but you can't always sit
1262000	1264000	You're on a fucking plane for three hours
1264000	1267000	So there's a light that's just always on that's like
1267000	1271000	It's a green light with a picture of a seatbelt
1271000	1274000	With the arrow going, the seatbelt is unlatched
1274000	1276000	But the arrow is going like this
1276000	1280000	Like this seatbelt's going to get latched on the sign
1280000	1282000	Okay, so that would seem to indicate
1282000	1285000	Fasten your seatbelts, everybody
1285000	1288000	Which they make you do at the top of the flight
1288000	1291000	They never turn that fucking thing off, ever
1291000	1293000	If you ever have to take a shit
1293000	1295000	Like you just get up and you're like
1295000	1298000	You know, it's always random, the interaction you have
1298000	1300000	They're like, we'd like you to sit
1300000	1302000	And so if you really have to take a shit real bad
1302000	1304000	You go, I gotta take a shit real bad
1304000	1307000	They're like, well, I have no legal right to stop you
1307000	1311000	They're not allowed to, if you want to get up
1311000	1313000	You can get up, and you can go do it
1313000	1315000	But they are legally bound to say
1315000	1317000	We don't advise it, we can't say you should
1317000	1320000	Yeah, so expressing that with a sign
1320000	1322000	That's like just a thing that's lit up
1322000	1325000	Like that's very, that's just boy who cried wolf
1325000	1328000	Because it's just like, okay, so I'm just going to ignore everything that you do
1328000	1330000	Because what is this?
1330000	1332000	My sign problem on planes is that
1332000	1334000	There's the sign for the laboratory
1334000	1336000	And it's a man and a woman
1336000	1339000	And the woman is designed as
1339000	1342000	There's a man and a woman standing in between
1342000	1344000	There's a sink in between them
1344000	1346000	On a pedestal, and it's a toilet
1346000	1349000	It's a little sink kind of thing
1349000	1350000	It's a basin
1350000	1352000	It's a basin in the middle on a pedestal
1352000	1354000	But the thing is, if you turn that basin over
1354000	1356000	That's the woman's dress
1356000	1358000	She's dressed like an upside down sink
1358000	1361000	I find that very diminishing
1362000	1364000	Like she's a receptacle
1364000	1366000	Or
1366000	1370000	Or an agent of hygiene
1370000	1372000	I don't know
1372000	1374000	Like maybe they're cleaner than us
1374000	1376000	Look at that sink, and then look at the woman
1376000	1378000	She's just an upside down sink with a head on top of it
1378000	1380000	They don't know what they're doing on these things
1380000	1383000	And it's disturbing because obviously
1383000	1385000	I probably don't have to point this out
1385000	1388000	It's like a 90 ton piece of metal that they fling into the air
1388000	1392000	And rely on some weird pre-Newtonian principle
1392000	1395000	To just keep it going like a paper airplane
1395000	1397000	Those things aren't like spaceships where it's like
1397000	1399000	There's thrusters and stuff on there
1399000	1402000	But really the whole thing is there's like little fans in there
1402000	1405000	That if the plane's already in the air
1405000	1408000	It tends to stay in the air
1408000	1410000	That's what a turbine is, as I understand it
1410000	1412000	Air's rushing through the thing
1412000	1415000	And then the things spin because air's coming through
1415000	1417000	And because the things spin, the plane stays up
1417000	1419000	There's a problem with that system
1419000	1421000	If that thing gets trans...
1421000	1423000	What if someone turns the air off?
1423000	1425000	Like God
1425000	1427000	Which he sometimes does
1427000	1429000	And probably will if we keep this up
1429000	1431000	If one of the engines...
1431000	1433000	Turn off the wind?
1433000	1436000	What if God just says
1436000	1438000	For the next 10 seconds I just want to...
1438000	1440000	Can I get everyone's attention please?
1440000	1442000	Well put your seat belt on
1443000	1445000	If God...
1445000	1447000	I don't know what the symbol is
1447000	1449000	But if God turns off the air
1449000	1452000	Ladies and gentlemen, please put your seat belt on
1453000	1455000	Put your seat belt on
1455000	1458000	God just turned off the air
1458000	1460000	Put your seat belt on
1460000	1463000	And hugged the person next to you
1463000	1465000	Well that's what I'm saying
1465000	1467000	It's an ungodly thing getting on these things
1467000	1469000	And people are dying all the time
1469000	1473000	We don't pay any attention to it
1473000	1476000	Do you think the guy in the cockpit has a degree in this shit?
1476000	1478000	I don't know, I don't think so
1478000	1482000	I think he's wearing a little Captain Crunch outfit
1484000	1489000	From my experience, the average person is an idiot
1489000	1491000	Just the average person
1491000	1493000	Because the average IQ is 100
1493000	1496000	Do you want a 100 IQ man flying your plane?
1496000	1498000	Or lady?
1500000	1502000	It's just as stupid as men
1502000	1504000	Give yourselves a hand
1508000	1510000	It's like with the epaulets and the things
1510000	1512000	It feels like compensation
1512000	1513000	Doesn't it?
1513000	1515000	Man, those epaulets
1517000	1521000	Wow, those epaulets are really bringing me down, man
1521000	1523000	I just don't believe...
1523000	1525000	What is the thing about the epaulets?
1525000	1526000	Why the epaulets though?
1526000	1528000	There's no function there
1528000	1530000	What's up with those epaulets?
1530000	1532000	Because if they dressed the way that they...
1532000	1534000	At only the level that they needed to
1534000	1536000	You'd be even more freaked out
1536000	1538000	Because he would look like a Time Warner Cable guy
1538000	1540000	So they have to look true
1540000	1543000	We're more confident when they dress like Captain Crunch
1543000	1545000	We think, okay, we want that
1545000	1547000	I want more, I want more of that
1547000	1550000	Like if a guy with like two sets of epaulets came on
1550000	1553000	I would be, holy shit, we got a really good pilot here
1553000	1556000	They kind of do like a good cut, bad cut thing
1556000	1558000	If the stock is wavering, they're like
1558000	1560000	We've got to amp this up
1560000	1562000	So a guy comes on with epaulets
1562000	1565000	He goes, everybody buckle up
1565000	1567000	We're going to go over the Grand Canyon
1567000	1569000	And then another guy comes on with like two epaulets
1569000	1571000	And goes like, get out of here
1571000	1573000	Get out of here, go over the Grand Canyon
1573000	1574000	That's a big hole
1574000	1576000	Yeah
1576000	1578000	Sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen
1578000	1580000	I'd be up front like, yeah, come on
1580000	1581000	Thank you for flying United
1581000	1584000	I'm Captain, no, Colonel
1585000	1586000	Jon Jommertham
1586000	1587000	Yeah
1587000	1590000	We're going to fly around the Grand Canyon
1590000	1591000	Nice
1591000	1594000	Like you should when there's a big hole in the earth
1594000	1598000	That's the whole point of a plane, to not crash into shit
1598000	1599000	Don't fly over the Grand Canyon
1599000	1600000	Yeah
1600000	1602000	I'm going to fly around it
1602000	1603000	You can buckle up
1603000	1605000	You know what, don't buckle up
1605000	1607000	Because it won't matter
1607000	1608000	Stand, turn the light off
1608000	1609000	Do jumping checks
1609000	1611000	Take two iPads, plug them both in
1611000	1613000	And rub them on a laptop
1613000	1615000	And do little Elvis kicks
1615000	1617000	Because if I'm doing my job right
1617000	1618000	That's what you can do
1618000	1619000	Because that's what rich people do
1619000	1620000	When they get in their private jets
1620000	1621000	They don't have seat belts
1621000	1625000	Let's make an okay go video right now
1627000	1630000	I'm going to turn this shit upside down
1630000	1632000	Denzel style
1632000	1634000	Denzel
1635000	1636000	Denzel
1636000	1637000	Denzel
1637000	1638000	Yeah, I know
1638000	1640000	You reduce them in stature
1640000	1642000	Denzel
1643000	1645000	Denzel
1645000	1649000	You make them sound like a forgotten reindeer
1652000	1655000	I'm Dasher, I'm Prancer, Denzel
1655000	1657000	Denzel, whatever
1657000	1659000	You're there for redundancy
1659000	1662000	In case Dasher and Prancer have a bad back
1662000	1665000	Denzel comes off the bench
1665000	1669000	If Blitzen has a sore hoof
1669000	1671000	Or Sully
1671000	1673000	Hey, so
1673000	1675000	So Cody, Cody got
1675000	1677000	She got an Uber from my place
1677000	1679000	After we got home from the airport
1679000	1682000	And her Uber driver's name was Strategy
1684000	1685000	Was it really?
1685000	1686000	Yeah, I know
1686000	1687000	It was Strategy
1687000	1689000	Well, I mean was it, it was on the screen
1689000	1693000	I had an Uber guy named Beethoven
1696000	1697000	These are guys who obviously
1697000	1698000	Their former name
1698000	1700000	They did something really terrible
1701000	1702000	It was an Uber driver
1702000	1703000	I heard they switched Uber accounts
1703000	1704000	Oh, yeah
1704000	1705000	Yeah, yeah
1707000	1709000	Strategy, that's good
1709000	1712000	Yeah, that's their other Reddit account
1712000	1714000	Because you never know
1714000	1716000	Can people see when I
1716000	1717000	Do you go on Reddit?
1717000	1719000	Have you stopped doing that?
1719000	1721000	Do you look at your Reddit for porn?
1721000	1722000	Or for
1722000	1724000	Reddit has porn?
1724000	1725000	Oh, yeah
1725000	1729000	Yeah, it has
1729000	1730000	It has
1730000	1735000	It has highly sorted, curated, hierarchically arranged porn
1735000	1736000	With
1737000	1738000	You can comment on it
1738000	1740000	And get upvoted and downvoted
1740000	1742000	Of everything you could ever gain from Reddit
1742000	1746000	As applicable to porn as everything else
1746000	1748000	No, I don't really
1748000	1749000	I don't really frequent Reddit
1749000	1750000	Because I'm a narcissist
1750000	1751000	And I haven't
1751000	1754000	My favorite thing about Reddit was like
1754000	1756000	You know, I go to community
1756000	1758000	And Rick and Morty and Dan Harmon and stuff
1758000	1759000	And I just
1759000	1760000	It's too
1760000	1762000	I'm too loathsome a person
1762000	1764000	And too narcissistic
1764000	1769000	To continue to disappoint people as a human being
1769000	1770000	On this level
1770000	1772000	And then also read about myself incessantly
1776000	1778000	Uncle Dennis is here
1780000	1781000	I have a real Uncle Dennis
1781000	1782000	I met him
1782000	1783000	I'm bad at making up names
1784000	1786000	For Uncle Dennis
1786000	1788000	I brought Uncle Dennis to your impromptu show
1788000	1789000	Yeah, it was fun
1789000	1791000	And he had a blast
1791000	1793000	Because he's a fan
1793000	1794000	And it was a very funny show
1794000	1795000	Thank you
1795000	1799000	You and Ryan Stiles did Neil Diamond and Gordon Lightfoot
1799000	1800000	Singing a duet
1800000	1801000	And it was really funny
1801000	1804000	Remember when we went to see Neil Diamond in Las Vegas?
1807000	1809000	We went to see
1809000	1810000	Remember this?
1810000	1811000	Do you remember?
1811000	1812000	We had to see this
1812000	1813000	I remember
1813000	1814000	I didn't go
1814000	1815000	You didn't go?
1815000	1816000	I was on Mushrooms
1816000	1818000	And you came back from that concert
1818000	1821000	And it was like three hours on a hotel room floor
1821000	1824000	Listening to Rob describe the Neil Diamond concert
1824000	1826000	That was my Neil Diamond concert
1826000	1827000	That was the best
1827000	1828000	That was the best
1828000	1830000	I got to go backstage with Sam Simon
1830000	1831000	Who got us the tickets
1831000	1834000	And we met Neil Diamond for the show
1834000	1836000	And I was really excited about that
1836000	1838000	And I've seen
1838000	1839000	At that point
1839000	1840000	I said like
1840000	1841000	I think I've seen him eight times in concert
1841000	1843000	I think that was my sixth time
1843000	1845000	And so I meet Neil Diamond right before the show
1845000	1846000	And I go
1846000	1848000	Mr. Diamond, it's a pleasure to meet you
1848000	1850000	This will be my sixth time seeing you
1850000	1851000	And he takes my hand
1851000	1852000	And he goes
1852000	1853000	A fan
1858000	1860000	And then the grooviest part of it was that
1860000	1864000	His assistant, like this big bouncer guy
1864000	1867000	Like his kind of like handler and like bodyguard guy
1867000	1870000	Had a wind-up like disposable camera
1870000	1871000	And he goes
1871000	1872000	Get together
1872000	1873000	And he took like
1873000	1874000	Snap, snap, snap
1874000	1875000	Wine, wine, wine, snap
1875000	1877000	And then gave me the camera
1877000	1878000	And he goes
1878000	1879000	Keep it
1879000	1883000	Neil Diamond has become a human wedding
1883000	1885000	Yeah, yeah
1885000	1887000	And he gave you a Mason jar
1887000	1888000	And he's like
1888000	1889000	Look, free refills
1889000	1891000	And then you can use it at home
1891000	1893000	When I would go see Neil Diamond at concert
1893000	1894000	I would always try to predict
1894000	1896000	What the first song he would sing would be
1896000	1898000	And one time I was right about it
1898000	1899000	But usually you're not right
1899000	1900000	Because you've got a million songs
1900000	1902000	So we're leaving him
1902000	1906000	And it was me, Drew, Carrie, Sam
1906000	1908000	And I think Nick Vinay was back there too
1908000	1911000	Because our friend produced like Neil Diamond
1911000	1912000	A long time ago or something
1912000	1914000	And we're leaving
1914000	1915000	And I said, well hey, have a great show
1915000	1916000	Give him hell out there
1916000	1917000	And he goes
1917000	1918000	Neil Diamond goes like
1918000	1919000	What?
1921000	1922000	Like I was leaving
1922000	1924000	And the director of Saving Silverman was there
1924000	1926000	Like they just made that movie
1926000	1927000	So he was talking to him
1927000	1928000	And I go, give him hell
1928000	1929000	And he goes
1929000	1930000	What?
1930000	1931000	I go
1931000	1933000	Give him hell, man
1933000	1934000	Have a good show
1934000	1935000	And he's like
1935000	1937000	We will
1939000	1940000	And he's like
1940000	1941000	Give me a weird look
1941000	1942000	I'm like
1942000	1943000	All right, man
1943000	1944000	Knock him dead
1944000	1945000	Like give him hell
1945000	1946000	He's like
1946000	1947000	Watch?
1947000	1948000	How dare you
1948000	1949000	So we leave
1949000	1950000	And Sam was like
1950000	1951000	What the fuck was that about
1951000	1952000	I don't know
1952000	1953000	The first song
1953000	1955000	It was a new song he had called
1955000	1956000	Give Him Hell
1957000	1958000	Totally accidental
1958000	1959000	He thought you were
1959000	1960000	He thought you were like
1960000	1961000	Napster
1961000	1962000	He thought you were
1962000	1964000	You're not supposed to fucking know that, Jack
1964000	1965000	How did that leak?
1965000	1966000	Yeah
1966000	1967000	How did that leak
1967000	1969000	At a time of no leaks
1971000	1973000	The I.T. guy told me
1973000	1976000	It was airtight tonight
1977000	1980000	My onstage with you and I'm doing Neil Diamond
1981000	1982000	Can you attitude Neil Diamond?
1982000	1983000	How would that work?
1983000	1985000	Yes, yes
1987000	1989000	Do I have a song that might work for that?
1989000	1990000	Let's see
1994000	1995000	Far
1996000	1999000	We've been traveling far
2001000	2003000	Without a home
2003000	2007000	Oh wait, our home is the village of mushrooms
2008000	2010000	Because I sounded like Smurf
2011000	2012000	No, I think the answer is
2012000	2014000	You can't do Neil Diamond
2015000	2016000	That is him
2018000	2019000	My friend Johnny Polonsky
2019000	2021000	I played some of his music on the show before
2021000	2023000	He's a session guitar player
2023000	2025000	And he did I think 12 songs
2025000	2027000	It was one of Neil Diamond's last records
2027000	2029000	Was that Rick Rubin maybe?
2029000	2033000	And so he worked with Neil for a few weeks
2033000	2036000	And as I say, I'm a giant Neil Diamond fan
2036000	2037000	So I made him tell me a thousand stories
2037000	2039000	Neil would come in every morning
2039000	2040000	Without his toupee
2040000	2043000	And he'd wear a denim jumpsuit
2044000	2046000	Like a onesie
2047000	2048000	Just denim
2048000	2050000	And at 10am he'd have a cognac
2050000	2052000	Like Gene Jammas
2053000	2054000	I'm sorry
2054000	2055000	Gene Jammas
2055000	2057000	Like Gene Jammas
2058000	2060000	Wait a second
2061000	2063000	Just keep doing that
2063000	2065000	That makes me so happy
2066000	2067000	So he would just come in
2067000	2068000	Like Brandi in a cigar
2068000	2069000	And he would talk
2069000	2071000	He never talked to my friend Johnny
2071000	2073000	And when Johnny was finally done
2073000	2074000	He was wrapped on it
2074000	2075000	And he was packing up his guitar
2075000	2077000	And leaving for the final day
2077000	2078000	Neil comes out of the booth
2078000	2079000	And he's like
2079000	2080000	Hey, you're Johnny, right?
2080000	2081000	He's like
2081000	2082000	Look I'm sorry
2082000	2084000	I didn't really get to talk to you that much
2084000	2086000	But it was really a pleasure working with you
2086000	2087000	And if I ever do another record
2087000	2088000	I want you to be on it
2088000	2090000	Because I like what you do
2090000	2091000	And Johnny's like
2091000	2092000	Thanks man
2092000	2093000	Absolutely
2093000	2094000	And he goes
2094000	2095000	Johnny, let me tell you something
2095000	2096000	You're a real motherfucker
2096000	2097000	And I mean that
2097000	2098000	And I mean that
2098000	2100000	In the best possible way
2102000	2103000	Alright
2104000	2105000	You could do worse
2105000	2106000	Yeah, fucking Neil Diamond
2106000	2107000	You could do worse than Neil Diamond
2107000	2109000	Calling you a motherfucker
2111000	2112000	Despite all outward appearances
2112000	2113000	I'm straight
2113000	2115000	But I would make out with Neil Diamond
2115000	2117000	I would fucking make out with Neil Diamond
2117000	2118000	I would have made out with Bowie
2118000	2121000	Bowie and Neil I would totally make out with
2122000	2123000	But that's it
2124000	2125000	Where's Spencer?
2125000	2126000	Spencer is
2126000	2127000	Taking a huge shit
2127000	2128000	Spencer feels like shit
2128000	2130000	And we text him
2130000	2131000	He said
2131000	2132000	I'm gonna bow out of the show tonight
2132000	2133000	And we
2133000	2134000	He said
2134000	2135000	I feel like shit
2135000	2136000	And we said
2136000	2137000	Someone said like diarrhea
2137000	2138000	And he said
2138000	2140000	It takes more than that to keep me down
2140000	2141000	Or something like that
2141000	2142000	I paraphrase
2142000	2144000	So whatever it is
2144000	2146000	It could be emotional diarrhea
2146000	2147000	You know
2147000	2148000	The price of Spencer
2148000	2149000	Psychologically
2149000	2150000	You know
2150000	2151000	Like being Spencer
2151000	2153000	I mean can you imagine what goes on up there?
2153000	2156000	I had a pretty good colonic this morning
2157000	2158000	You know what
2158000	2160000	You put a pin in that for one second
2160000	2161000	I did
2162000	2163000	You did put a pin in it
2163000	2164000	Is that why you needed the high colonic?
2164000	2165000	Yeah
2165000	2166000	Are you one of those guys?
2166000	2167000	The needles and the ballpoint?
2167000	2168000	One of those guys
2168000	2169000	I'm your friend
2174000	2177000	I want to know why you put a pin in Rob's pretty good colonic
2177000	2178000	Well because I was gonna
2178000	2181000	I do think it's kind of funny the idea that the O.J. Simpson thing is dominating the Emmys
2181000	2183000	Because when you looked at the credits of that
2183000	2185000	Of that very enjoyable show
2185000	2187000	It was like literally everybody
2187000	2189000	Like if that show sweeps the Emmys
2189000	2190000	It's almost sort of like a
2190000	2192000	Like everybody worked on that
2192000	2194000	Like weren't there like Brilstein's and Grey's
2194000	2197000	And also like people that don't even
2197000	2198000	Like they were like
2199000	2200000	The Larry
2200000	2201000	A lot of people
2201000	2202000	The Scott Alexander's
2202000	2204000	And it was like
2204000	2208000	Every single human being that had ever made anything for television or movies
2208000	2210000	Had some kind of like credit on that show
2210000	2212000	So now they're like sweeping the Emmys
2212000	2213000	And it's like
2213000	2214000	Are they happy or sad about that?
2214000	2216000	Is this the Travolta one?
2216000	2217000	Yeah
2217000	2218000	Okay yeah
2218000	2219000	I just wondered
2219000	2220000	You know they go to the parties
2220000	2221000	And there was like 500 people
2221000	2222000	And they all have Emmys
2222000	2223000	And it's like
2223000	2224000	You guys already had them
2224000	2225000	Or Oscars
2225000	2226000	And like
2226000	2227000	And you didn't beat any of each other
2227000	2228000	So there's no satisfaction there
2228000	2229000	They must be bummed out
2229000	2230000	That's my thing
2230000	2231000	I bet they're like going to each other
2231000	2232000	In like smaller groups
2232000	2233000	And going like
2233000	2234000	Man
2234000	2236000	This Emmy's worth nothing
2236000	2237000	I know right?
2237000	2238000	Because the guy we hated
2238000	2239000	Is also working on it
2239000	2240000	Yeah
2240000	2241000	Alright
2241000	2242000	I guess
2242000	2243000	I guess
2243000	2245000	I guess I am different than the audience
2245000	2247000	I guess I do think about different shit
2247000	2248000	I'm just
2248000	2249000	Speaking of
2249000	2250000	Maybe I'm an artist
2250000	2251000	Speaking of different shit
2251000	2252000	Rob let's talk about your colonic
2252000	2253000	Okay let's talk about this high colonic
2253000	2254000	We can edit out my
2254000	2255000	High colonic?
2255000	2256000	The observations about the Emmys
2256000	2257000	No it was good
2257000	2258000	Have you ever tried these colonics?
2258000	2259000	They're great
2259000	2260000	Not a
2260000	2261000	Only a
2261000	2262000	Never a high one
2262000	2263000	What's a high colonic?
2263000	2264000	I've never
2264000	2265000	I don't know what a high colonic is
2265000	2266000	It seems like if it's high
2266000	2267000	You're doing it wrong
2267000	2268000	I don't know what you're talking about
2268000	2269000	I just have a regular
2269000	2270000	No isn't that the high colonic is the
2270000	2271000	Yeah
2271000	2272000	You go to somebody
2272000	2273000	And they put a
2273000	2274000	They put a hose up your butt
2275000	2276000	Yes
2276000	2277000	Yeah
2277000	2278000	Yeah I went to the
2278000	2279000	I went to the lady
2279000	2280000	And she
2280000	2281000	And she
2281000	2282000	I've been going for a while
2282000	2283000	And I was
2283000	2284000	A little skeptical
2284000	2286000	But I
2286000	2287000	I'm
2287000	2288000	I'm alright with it
2288000	2289000	It's not too bad
2289000	2290000	It's good
2290000	2291000	It's good
2291000	2292000	She
2292000	2293000	She did say the first time I did it
2293000	2294000	It's like
2294000	2295000	I don't use an adult one
2295000	2298000	I use a child
2298000	2299000	Applicator
2299000	2300000	And I was like
2300000	2301000	Does that mean it's like
2301000	2302000	Besides a
2303000	2304000	Little boy's dick
2306000	2307000	Wait
2307000	2308000	Wait wait
2308000	2309000	Oh my
2309000	2310000	Okay
2310000	2311000	Alright yeah
2311000	2312000	That's a
2312000	2313000	Roller coaster ride
2313000	2314000	Can I rewind a little bit on that one
2314000	2315000	Okay
2315000	2316000	I thought
2316000	2317000	I thought you were
2317000	2318000	I thought you were being flattered
2318000	2319000	Because she was implying
2319000	2320000	That your butthole was as
2320000	2321000	Tight as a little boy's
2321000	2323000	But then you wouldn't even
2323000	2325000	I don't know what's going on behind my back
2325000	2327000	All she said is like
2327000	2328000	Most
2328000	2329000	Most colonic
2329000	2330000	Doctors
2330000	2331000	Use
2331000	2332000	Most colonic
2332000	2333000	Most colonic
2333000	2334000	She's just
2334000	2335000	A person I met
2335000	2336000	At a bar somewhere
2336000	2337000	She just
2337000	2338000	She does
2338000	2339000	She does terrible readings
2339000	2340000	And then
2340000	2341000	Right right right
2341000	2342000	And then weirdly
2342000	2343000	But I use a child one
2343000	2344000	Whether it's the fool or the death card
2344000	2345000	She's like you know what that means
2345000	2346000	She's saying
2346000	2347000	You got a lot of extra shit in your butt
2347000	2349000	She said I'm going to give you the child one
2349000	2351000	Because that's better than the adult one
2351000	2352000	But your thing is
2352000	2353000	You think it's supposed to be more like a little
2353000	2354000	I thought it was
2354000	2355000	Because it's
2355000	2357000	More like a little boy's penis
2357000	2359000	Well not a little girl's
2362000	2363000	You think the colonic
2363000	2364000	Instrument is
2364000	2365000	Is built on
2365000	2366000	Being a dick
2366000	2367000	Girth?
2367000	2368000	Yeah
2368000	2369000	Well
2369000	2370000	I mean
2370000	2371000	Maybe
2371000	2372000	I just
2372000	2373000	I'm just assuming
2373000	2374000	I don't know
2374000	2375000	How
2375000	2376000	I've never had a colonic
2376000	2377000	So like
2377000	2378000	They're great
2380000	2381000	But you sounded tentative
2381000	2383000	You said it was only pretty good
2383000	2384000	They're pretty
2384000	2385000	I
2385000	2386000	And it wasn't too bad
2386000	2387000	It was not right
2387000	2388000	I mean like
2388000	2389000	I
2389000	2390000	I mean
2390000	2391000	I feel a lot healthier
2391000	2392000	Do they insert
2392000	2393000	The instrument
2393000	2394000	Yes
2394000	2395000	Up your butt
2395000	2396000	Yes
2396000	2397000	And so you got the baby one
2397000	2398000	I got the baby one
2398000	2399000	Because of your delicious
2399000	2400000	Well no
2400000	2401000	She didn't
2401000	2402000	She said
2402000	2403000	Your words not mine
2403000	2404000	She
2404000	2405000	Well she said
2405000	2406000	It's something I really love
2406000	2407000	She said other
2407000	2409000	My colleagues use a larger gauge
2409000	2410000	Right
2410000	2411000	Of
2411000	2412000	Right
2412000	2413000	Of
2413000	2414000	Animator
2414000	2415000	Animator
2415000	2416000	The animator
2416000	2417000	Yeah
2417000	2418000	Because the enema
2418000	2419000	Of my enema
2419000	2420000	Is my friend
2420000	2421000	Yeah
2421000	2423000	I keep my
2423000	2425000	I keep my enemas close
2425000	2426000	Yeah
2426000	2428000	I keep my emenator even closer
2428000	2430000	Keep your enemas closer
2430000	2431000	Keep your enemas closer
2431000	2433000	With the new triple gauge enemator
2438000	2439000	No okay so
2439000	2440000	Really
2440000	2441000	You're not giving us any of the information
2441000	2442000	That we actually want
2442000	2443000	Which is
2443000	2444000	Why
2444000	2445000	What do you
2445000	2446000	What do you
2446000	2448000	What does a person that goes and gets a colonic
2448000	2449000	What
2449000	2450000	What are they experiencing
2450000	2451000	That makes them want to go get one
2451000	2452000	I
2452000	2453000	I have
2453000	2454000	A parasite
2454000	2455000	You have a parasite
2455000	2456000	Yeah I'm trying to get
2456000	2457000	Rid of all of the
2457000	2458000	Graboids in my
2458000	2459000	Intestinal track
2459000	2461000	What the fuck
2461000	2462000	For you millennials
2462000	2464000	Those are the monsters from Tremors
2464000	2465000	Yes
2467000	2468000	No I
2468000	2469000	I
2469000	2470000	I've got a parasite
2470000	2471000	I have a parasite
2471000	2472000	You got a sand worm in your butt?
2472000	2474000	I have a sand worm in my butt
2474000	2475000	No in my
2475000	2476000	In my intestinal track
2476000	2477000	What is it a tapeworm?
2477000	2478000	It could be
2478000	2479000	Yeah I don't know
2479000	2480000	I'm not necessarily sure
2480000	2481000	But I've been
2481000	2482000	I've been taking like
2482000	2483000	Massive amounts of
2483000	2484000	I haven't been
2484000	2485000	I haven't been very
2485000	2486000	Well
2486000	2487000	For the last couple of months
2487000	2488000	How come
2488000	2489000	How come you have been
2489000	2490000	You have been
2490000	2491000	Since the age of
2491000	2492000	The thirty
2492000	2493000	Like
2493000	2494000	Like obsessed with
2494000	2495000	Cleaning your butthole
2495000	2496000	Yes
2496000	2497000	To the point where you've
2497000	2498000	Scalded it in the past
2498000	2499000	Yes
2499000	2500000	And we've
2500000	2501000	Just go back through the archive
2501000	2502000	We've covered this several times
2502000	2503000	Meanwhile I
2503000	2505000	I could be said certainly
2505000	2507000	That Superman's Lex Luthor
2507000	2508000	Like I
2508000	2509000	I am
2509000	2510000	I am
2510000	2511000	I am not from that planet
2511000	2512000	Right
2512000	2513000	If anything
2513000	2514000	I push the limits of
2514000	2515000	Right
2515000	2516000	Of of of
2516000	2517000	Of what you should do when
2517000	2518000	Like I
2518000	2519000	But you gave yourself
2519000	2520000	An accidental
2520000	2521000	I think some cave men
2521000	2523000	If transported through time
2523000	2525000	Observing me for a week
2525000	2526000	Would go
2526000	2527000	Dude
2528000	2529000	It's a butt
2529000	2530000	You gotta wipe it
2530000	2532000	More than that
2532000	2533000	You're gonna go back out
2533000	2534000	And collaborate with your friends?
2534000	2535000	But you
2535000	2536000	You you gave yourself
2536000	2537000	An accidental colonic
2537000	2538000	In your bathtub
2538000	2539000	Back in the day
2539000	2540000	Yes I did
2540000	2541000	I will
2541000	2542000	I will never forget it
2542000	2543000	Yeah yeah
2543000	2544000	Accidental
2544000	2545000	Accidental
2545000	2546000	Because I had
2546000	2547000	Jets in my tub
2547000	2548000	That I was excited to use
2548000	2549000	I bought a new house
2549000	2550000	There were jets
2550000	2551000	So your ass was up
2551000	2553000	Against the side of the tub?
2553000	2554000	Yeah because
2554000	2555000	Well
2555000	2556000	Yeah but well
2556000	2558000	Dot dot dot
2558000	2559000	Explain that
2559000	2560000	What is it?
2560000	2561000	No I did
2561000	2562000	I explained it on the podcast
2562000	2563000	I mean it's
2564000	2565000	He would jerk off
2565000	2566000	He would get his butt
2566000	2567000	Up against the jet
2567000	2568000	It wasn't an accident
2568000	2569000	No it wasn't
2569000	2571000	Put his ass up against the jet
2571000	2572000	And then he was surprised
2572000	2574000	It was weird
2574000	2575000	No
2575000	2577000	I was surprised when water
2577000	2578000	Was it strange?
2578000	2579000	Went up my asshole
2579000	2581000	And filled me up like a water balloon
2581000	2582000	Yes
2582000	2583000	Because before that
2583000	2585000	All it did was tickle the rim
2585000	2587000	And make me happier
2589000	2590000	But then one day
2590000	2591000	I just
2591000	2592000	I flew too close to the sun
2592000	2593000	As Jeff said
2593000	2594000	And I
2594000	2595000	And I was like
2595000	2596000	I was scissoring
2596000	2597000	And like
2597000	2598000	I
2598000	2599000	You know
2599000	2600000	You
2600000	2601000	You get used to shit
2601000	2602000	This is why I'm afraid to fly
2602000	2603000	Because the guys in the cockpit
2603000	2604000	It's like
2604000	2605000	How soon
2605000	2607000	If you start to take technology for granted
2607000	2608000	Like
2608000	2609000	You know
2609000	2610000	These guys are
2610000	2611000	How do you know the guy in the cockpit?
2611000	2612000	You don't know what they're doing in the cockpit
2612000	2613000	The door is closed
2613000	2614000	They could be
2614000	2615000	Treating it like a DVR
2615000	2616000	They're just like
2616000	2617000	Scoop it scoop it scoop it
2617000	2618000	I don't know
2618000	2619000	It usually does this
2619000	2620000	And I was like
2620000	2621000	Oh yeah
2621000	2622000	So I had gotten accustomed to like
2622000	2623000	Okay yeah
2623000	2624000	A little jet on my little
2624000	2625000	I'm a little poo poo
2625000	2626000	Uh
2626000	2627000	You ain't hurting no one
2627000	2628000	Like no
2628000	2629000	It's like
2629000	2630000	Ain't nobody's business but your own
2630000	2631000	There's a little stimulation down there
2631000	2632000	Where there's some extra nerve endings
2632000	2634000	Also you were super excited back then
2634000	2636000	Because you were taking baths daily
2636000	2637000	You were
2637000	2638000	And that's why
2638000	2639000	You were shining like the Chrysler Building
2639000	2640000	Yes
2640000	2641000	This is
2641000	2642000	A lot of people
2642000	2643000	Die hard fans are like
2643000	2644000	Why am I being punished for being a fan?
2644000	2645000	I know all this
2645000	2646000	You know
2646000	2647000	It's like
2647000	2648000	Like
2648000	2649000	I mean I had to put Dan Lee
2649000	2650000	In the corner to just like
2650000	2651000	Have it be
2651000	2652000	On the video feed
2652000	2653000	With him coming up
2653000	2654000	And going like
2654000	2655000	Webheads will remember that
2655000	2656000	Yeah
2656000	2657000	Dan got a tub
2657000	2658000	And was fucking jerking off
2658000	2660000	Like a crazy person
2660000	2662000	And had discovered like jets
2662000	2663000	On his butthole
2663000	2665000	And then one day I was like
2665000	2666000	I went too far
2666000	2667000	And the setting was too high
2667000	2668000	And it just like
2668000	2669000	It's that difference
2669000	2670000	You know when you take a water balloon
2670000	2671000	And like you can
2671000	2673000	If you hold it underneath the faucet
2673000	2674000	And just turn on the faucet
2674000	2675000	Like
2675000	2676000	No water's gonna go in that water balloon
2676000	2677000	And then there's that day
2677000	2678000	When that moment
2678000	2679000	Like
2679000	2680000	I just like
2680000	2681000	All of a sudden
2681000	2682000	And it's like a binary thing
2682000	2683000	It's either happening or not
2683000	2684000	And like
2684000	2685000	It was just like
2685000	2686000	All of a sudden
2686000	2687000	I was like
2687000	2688000	Oh yeah
2688000	2689000	Wah!
2689000	2690000	Like
2690000	2691000	I was like
2691000	2692000	Like
2692000	2694000	There's probably people in the audience
2694000	2695000	Who know
2695000	2696000	Who are more
2696000	2697000	Who are more
2697000	2698000	You know
2698000	2699000	They take their butt
2699000	2700000	For more of a ride
2700000	2701000	You know
2701000	2702000	Like
2702000	2703000	They're more
2703000	2704000	They're more experts
2704000	2705000	In this kind of off-roading thing
2705000	2706000	They're like
2706000	2707000	V8 got in the
2707000	2708000	Front-wheel drive
2708000	2709000	And
2709000	2710000	Like
2710000	2711000	Like that happened to me
2711000	2712000	In Kentucky
2712000	2713000	On a four-wheeler
2713000	2714000	But I was like
2714000	2715000	This was
2715000	2716000	I was just
2716000	2717000	I was a newcomer
2717000	2718000	To the whole
2718000	2719000	Involving the button
2719000	2720000	Anything other than
2720000	2721000	Than the
2721000	2722000	For a sharpie
2722000	2723000	Yeah
2723000	2724000	And so
2724000	2725000	And so
2725000	2726000	And so all of a sudden
2726000	2727000	I had the sensation
2727000	2728000	That I've never had before
2728000	2729000	Which was the
2729000	2730000	In reverse
2730000	2732000	The sensation of pooping
2732000	2733000	It was
2733000	2734000	Like all of a sudden
2734000	2735000	There was just like
2735000	2736000	So much
2736000	2737000	Like just
2737000	2738000	Filling me up
2738000	2739000	In a
2739000	2740000	In a place where
2740000	2741000	I was like
2741000	2742000	Whoa!
2742000	2743000	And I like got up
2743000	2744000	Out of the tub
2744000	2745000	And like went over to the
2745000	2746000	Toilet instinctively
2746000	2747000	And sat down on it
2747000	2748000	And I was like
2748000	2749000	And then like just
2749000	2750000	Like flood came out
2750000	2751000	And I was like
2751000	2752000	Oh I just gave myself
2752000	2753000	An accidental enema
2753000	2754000	And?
2754000	2755000	How did you feel?
2755000	2756000	It was pretty good
2756000	2757000	Pretty good
2757000	2758000	It was good
2758000	2764000	Has the show really become this easy?
2765000	2766000	Fuck it
2766000	2767000	Wait
2767000	2770000	Where are our standards anyway?
2770000	2773000	It's Emmy night folks
2773000	2775000	All the craftsmen are at parties
2775000	2777000	And crafts ladies
2779000	2782000	Crafts ladies
2782000	2785000	Except for I guess UCP not doing so good
2787000	2789000	When do you leave us for
2789000	2790000	For Lego?
2790000	2791000	January
2791000	2792000	Yeah
2792000	2793000	Yes
2793000	2795000	You gonna be gone for a while?
2795000	2797000	Two years?
2797000	2798000	No
2798000	2800000	Where are you guys shooting now?
2800000	2801000	Shooting
2802000	2804000	It's in Vancouver
2806000	2807000	Canada
2807000	2808000	You know
2809000	2810000	It's only two hours away
2810000	2812000	You'll come visit, right?
2812000	2814000	What's up with those delays we read about
2814000	2815000	In the trades
2815000	2817000	What did you do wrong?
2817000	2818000	I don't know what you're talking about
2818000	2819000	And I can't say anything
2819000	2820000	It was in the papers
2820000	2821000	It said
2821000	2822000	Lego movie
2822000	2825000	Going to fucking delayed fucking
2825000	2827000	Director on
2827000	2829000	A colonic binge
2831000	2833000	I'm taking a year off for
2833000	2835000	Massive colonics
2835000	2836000	A tune up
2836000	2837000	Like Chevy, a tune up
2837000	2839000	Yeah, just a tune up
2839000	2840000	A tune up
2840000	2841000	I mean look
2841000	2843000	He's in rehab
2843000	2844000	In the article I read
2844000	2846000	It said Chevy was going in for
2846000	2848000	Alcohol related problems
2848000	2850000	Alcoholism
2850000	2851000	Yeah
2851000	2852000	He did however
2852000	2853000	Somebody pointed out
2853000	2854000	He did leave a very
2854000	2855000	Very concise
2855000	2857000	I think Chevy
2857000	2858000	You know
2858000	2860000	He's the last person to
2860000	2863000	If you listed his crimes
2863000	2865000	Or bad qualities
2865000	2867000	Definitely not on that list
2867000	2868000	Would be
2868000	2869000	Like
2869000	2870000	Shame
2870000	2871000	Like he's not
2871000	2872000	Like
2872000	2873000	He loves
2873000	2874000	As long as it's funny
2874000	2875000	Like he'll share stuff
2875000	2877000	I don't think it was his idea
2877000	2878000	To like downplay it
2878000	2879000	Or welling in double speak
2879000	2880000	The idea of going into rehab
2880000	2881000	Because he left a
2881000	2882000	It was on his
2882000	2884000	What's that dumb thing
2884000	2885000	That's like
2885000	2887000	Twitter for celebrities
2887000	2888000	Who say?
2888000	2889000	Like it's like
2889000	2890000	Oh you're famous
2890000	2891000	Why should you
2891000	2892000	Do what normal people do
2892000	2894000	Like that selfie you took
2894000	2896000	Might be worth money one day
2896000	2897000	Don't give that away
2897000	2898000	Isn't that what that thing is?
2898000	2899000	I don't know
2899000	2900000	Did I just get sardonic
2900000	2902000	About something for no reason?
2902000	2903000	All I know is
2903000	2905000	It was like a little paragraph
2905000	2906000	And he said
2906000	2907000	I'm going in
2907000	2908000	Because
2908000	2910000	My love of vodka needs to be
2910000	2911000	Something I am paraphrasing
2911000	2912000	But it was
2912000	2913000	It was
2913000	2914000	It was
2914000	2915000	It was all very clear
2915000	2916000	He was like
2916000	2917000	I'm going in
2917000	2918000	Because my family
2918000	2919000	I don't want them
2919000	2920000	To have to worry about me
2920000	2921000	And like all that stuff
2921000	2922000	I don't know how that tune up stuff
2922000	2924000	That's probably some spokesman who
2924000	2926000	Trying to do their job the right way
2926000	2928000	Trying to protect and all the stuff
2928000	2929000	And mitigate like
2929000	2930000	And then it gets
2930000	2931000	Then that becomes the funny thing
2931000	2932000	It's like
2932000	2933000	Get this
2933000	2934000	He's going in for a tune up
2934000	2936000	Why are you sitting over there?
2936000	2937000	Why did you go
2937000	2938000	Are you like the new Spencer?
2938000	2939000	Is that the
2939000	2940000	No
2940000	2941000	I'm
2941000	2942000	The old Rob
2942000	2945000	No
2945000	2946000	No don't
2946000	2947000	That's what you're doing
2947000	2948000	Don't do that
2948000	2949000	That was
2949000	2950000	Don't feel bad
2950000	2952000	No it isn't bad sir
2952000	2953000	It's
2953000	2954000	It's very good
2954000	2955000	Oh
2955000	2956000	Oh god
2956000	2957000	Oh okay
2957000	2958000	Alright
2958000	2959000	I like it over here
2959000	2960000	I don't
2960000	2961000	Okay
2961000	2962000	Here
2962000	2963000	I don't
2963000	2964000	I don't like
2964000	2965000	Don't fight me
2966000	2967000	You're so
2967000	2968000	You're so sweaty
2972000	2974000	You're all moist
2974000	2976000	Why are you that moist?
2976000	2977000	You're sitting down
2977000	2979000	Because every day is 6th grade for me
2979000	2980000	That's
2981000	2982000	Yeah
2982000	2983000	Finally
2983000	2984000	Now I
2984000	2986000	Can I suck at that trough?
2990000	2991000	I don't like that the
2991000	2993000	Flight attendant welcomes you
2993000	2995000	To the city that you're arriving in
2995000	2996000	With them
2997000	2998000	It just seems
2999000	3000000	It's just a little bit of a
3000000	3002000	Needless mind fucky like
3002000	3004000	Bullying thing
3004000	3005000	Yeah I'll call it what it is
3005000	3006000	Bullying
3008000	3009000	The flight attendant goes
3009000	3010000	Welcome to Chicago
3010000	3011000	And it's like
3011000	3013000	You just got here too motherfucker
3015000	3017000	Why is that bullying though?
3017000	3018000	Why is that bullying?
3018000	3020000	Because the unspoken part of that is
3020000	3021000	You newbie
3022000	3023000	You piece of shit that would
3023000	3025000	That if the plane crashed
3025000	3027000	Would fall for the float cushion thing
3027000	3029000	While I sprung out in a
3029000	3031000	Inspector Gadget parachute
3032000	3034000	You might be reading into that a little
3036000	3038000	You might be reading into that
3038000	3040000	I think they're just trying to be nice to you
3043000	3044000	Welcome to
3044000	3046000	Welcome to Chicago they say
3046000	3047000	Yeah
3047000	3048000	Yeah
3048000	3049000	They
3049000	3050000	I also don't like
3050000	3051000	There's no direct flights from
3051000	3052000	Los Angeles to Milwaukee
3052000	3053000	But I get
3053000	3054000	And I was like
3054000	3055000	It's a real drag
3055000	3056000	For real?
3056000	3057000	Yeah
3057000	3058000	No
3058000	3059000	But I guess that's
3059000	3060000	I was thinking
3060000	3061000	I was thinking about it I was like
3061000	3062000	Well okay so we're flying from
3062000	3063000	LA to Phoenix and then
3063000	3064000	From Phoenix to Milwaukee
3064000	3065000	And that's
3065000	3066000	That might be better I guess
3066000	3067000	Because like
3067000	3068000	Well if you're flying from
3068000	3069000	Los Angeles to Milwaukee
3070000	3071000	Like
3072000	3073000	Statistically speaking
3073000	3074000	Like the reason for that is
3074000	3075000	That something's gone wrong
3077000	3078000	Southwest I think
3078000	3080000	I think Southwest goes direct
3080000	3082000	Is the only direct flight to Milwaukee
3082000	3083000	But they suck
3083000	3085000	Are there other ones that do the comedy
3085000	3086000	The comedy
3086000	3087000	Yes
3087000	3088000	They do like
3088000	3090000	The fucking Muppet voices
3090000	3092000	And Donald Duck shit
3092000	3093000	It's just
3093000	3094000	A piece of shit
3094000	3095000	It's like a bus with wings
3095000	3096000	They just like go
3096000	3098000	Hey get on board
3098000	3099000	I hope you get a seat
3099000	3101000	And somebody's sitting on the floor
3102000	3104000	There's two people with chickens next to you
3104000	3105000	It's the worst
3106000	3107000	I got on a plane
3107000	3108000	A few days ago
3108000	3109000	Where was I coming back from
3109000	3110000	I forget
3111000	3112000	And I was
3113000	3114000	I walked up to the gate
3114000	3115000	Right at boarding time
3115000	3116000	I didn't know if I was late
3116000	3117000	Or earlier or whatever
3117000	3118000	And I said
3118000	3119000	Are you boarding?
3119000	3120000	Yeah priority
3120000	3121000	Are you priority?
3121000	3122000	I'm like yeah
3122000	3123000	I'm first class
3123000	3124000	I got on
3124000	3125000	I was the first person on
3125000	3126000	The plane
3126000	3127000	I didn't know
3127000	3128000	That was not intentional
3128000	3129000	I thought maybe I was a couple minutes late
3130000	3131000	I found a $20 bill
3132000	3133000	On the jet bridge
3133000	3134000	Like a little walkway
3135000	3136000	And I just went
3136000	3138000	And put that in the old pocket
3139000	3140000	And I get on the plane
3140000	3141000	And there's two flight attendants there
3141000	3142000	And they're like
3142000	3143000	Oh are we boarding already?
3144000	3145000	I didn't realize we were boarding
3145000	3146000	Oh I'm sorry
3146000	3147000	Yeah we're right this way
3147000	3148000	Where'd you see it
3148000	3149000	I'm in 2A
3149000	3150000	And I sat down
3150000	3151000	And I was the very first person on
3151000	3153000	So it wasn't like somebody was on that plane
3153000	3154000	And dropped that money
3154000	3155000	Maybe it was one of the flight attendants
3155000	3156000	I don't know
3157000	3158000	So I'm sitting there
3158000	3160000	And I got the $20 in my pocket
3161000	3162000	And we get
3163000	3164000	We get in the air
3164000	3166000	And the flight attendant comes down
3166000	3167000	Through all the people in first class
3167000	3169000	Hey did somebody drop $20?
3171000	3172000	Meaning like
3172000	3173000	I was like
3173000	3174000	No
3175000	3177000	I did not drop $20
3177000	3179000	I did the opposite of dropping $20
3179000	3180000	Well I did
3181000	3182000	But I was like
3183000	3185000	That meant it was hers, right?
3185000	3187000	But she was trying to lay a little trap there
3187000	3189000	Like no I found $20
3189000	3190000	And she would go
3190000	3191000	Mine
3191000	3192000	I don't know
3192000	3193000	I don't know
3193000	3195000	Did somebody else drop $20 too?
3195000	3196000	It was very confusing for me
3196000	3197000	She's like
3197000	3198000	I lost $20
3198000	3199000	Well I know if I ask
3199000	3200000	If anyone found it
3200000	3201000	The answer will be no
3201000	3203000	But maybe if I say
3203000	3205000	Has anyone lost $20?
3205000	3206000	Somebody would go
3206000	3208000	Oh I feel so guilty about this
3208000	3209000	Why would somebody
3209000	3210000	You're supposed to yell fire
3210000	3211000	But then I went
3211000	3212000	I went and bought my girlfriend
3212000	3213000	Cigarettes with it
3214000	3216000	$20 cigarettes?
3216000	3217000	I got her a couple of
3217000	3219000	How long are they?
3219000	3224000	They're the extra longs
3224000	3225000	But then
3225000	3226000	We walked out and she goes
3226000	3227000	You know that
3227000	3229000	That was counterfeit
3229000	3230000	I'm like what?
3230000	3231000	She's like
3231000	3232000	Was printed all wrong
3232000	3233000	The borders were all fucked up
3233000	3237000	I think I picked up and stole
3237000	3238000	And then used
3238000	3239000	Counterfeit $20
3239000	3240000	I think like
3240000	3241000	Some like
3241000	3244000	Some major awesome criminal
3244000	3245000	Was like
3245000	3246000	Taking that plane
3246000	3248000	And was dropping Counterfeit $20
3249000	3250000	Like a bullet hole
3250000	3251000	In his duffel bag
3251000	3252000	Or hers
3255000	3256000	Like was like
3256000	3258000	Hemorrhaging Counterfeit $20s or something
3258000	3259000	Yeah yeah
3259000	3261000	And so it was
3261000	3263000	You found one
3263000	3264000	And then someone else
3264000	3265000	Found another one
3265000	3266000	I was like
3266000	3267000	Is someone dropping $20s
3267000	3268000	All over the place?
3268000	3269000	And there's like a guy bleeding out
3269000	3270000	In coach
3270000	3271000	Just another martini
3273000	3274000	No no
3274000	3275000	I haven't seen any
3275000	3276000	Aaron's $20s
3277000	3278000	Because he got shot
3278000	3279000	Yeah I don't know
3279000	3280000	I'm not going to make up the whole story
3280000	3281000	To live and die in L.A.
3281000	3282000	Kind of thing
3282000	3283000	Yeah
3283000	3284000	Yeah
3284000	3285000	To live and die in L.A.
3285000	3286000	Yeah fine
3286000	3287000	I'm derivative
3287000	3288000	All right
3288000	3289000	Wow
3289000	3290000	So defensive
3290000	3291000	Yeah
3291000	3293000	I just came back from Milwaukee
3293000	3295000	I have like a lot of like
3295000	3297000	I got along with my mom for two days
3297000	3298000	So now I'm back here
3298000	3299000	And I'm like
3299000	3300000	What'd you mean by that
3300000	3301000	What'd you mean by that
3301000	3302000	What'd you mean by that
3302000	3303000	It had to go somewhere
3303000	3304000	It is an amazing city
3304000	3305000	Because like I met the nicest people
3305000	3306000	And like
3307000	3308000	Just like
3308000	3309000	Like people that were there to see my show
3309000	3310000	But also our fans of Harmon Town
3310000	3312000	Or Rick and Morty whatever
3312000	3314000	There is this awesome openness and sweetness
3314000	3315000	To the Midwest
3315000	3317000	And to Milwaukee in particular
3317000	3320000	But also a lot of like weird like
3320000	3322000	Not shame or self
3322000	3324000	Self effacing right
3324000	3325000	Yes
3326000	3328000	They diminish themselves in your eyes
3332000	3333000	Yes
3333000	3336000	Because the people who draw focus get kicked out
3337000	3338000	Of Milwaukee
3339000	3340000	Like me and Trump
3340000	3341000	No it's
3341000	3342000	Yeah it's like
3342000	3343000	It's very similar
3343000	3345000	I mean it's geographically
3345000	3347000	And I think genetically and culturally
3347000	3348000	Psychologically and spiritually
3348000	3350000	Like a very close cousin to Canada
3350000	3351000	I mean it's like
3351000	3352000	You're right up there
3352000	3354000	You're a hop skip and a jump
3354000	3355000	You're in a very cold
3355000	3357000	You're in a climate that's like inhospitable
3357000	3359000	Like you're in God's crosshairs
3359000	3361000	If you get cocky
3361000	3362000	Then the question becomes
3362000	3363000	Why are you so cocky?
3363000	3364000	Why don't you go somewhere warm?
3364000	3366000	So the answer has to be
3366000	3367000	Don't get cocky
3367000	3368000	Don't get cocky
3368000	3369000	That has to be the mantra
3369000	3372000	Of a more seasonal climate
3372000	3374000	And Milwaukee's like
3374000	3376000	So on the surface of it
3376000	3378000	There's this wonderful humility
3378000	3380000	And camaraderie
3380000	3381000	Fraternity
3381000	3382000	Or sorority
3383000	3385000	You are fucking nailing it tonight
3385000	3387000	I'm fucking like
3387000	3390000	I'm inclusiving the fuck out of tonight
3391000	3393000	Like tomorrow's headlines
3393000	3394000	Are going to be like
3394000	3396000	Dean Harmon included everybody
3396000	3398000	After the fact
3398000	3399000	Yeah, well yeah
3399000	3401000	Asterisks were flying
3401000	3403000	And all benefited
3403000	3406000	Women were receiving their alms
3408000	3410000	On the tails of sentences
3410000	3413000	With appendaged addenda
3415000	3418000	Caps were doffed to the fairer sex
3418000	3421000	At a speed comparable only
3421000	3424000	To the bionic advocate
3427000	3429000	Of a lesser known franchise
3429000	3430000	From the 70s
3431000	3432000	Bionic advocate
3432000	3434000	Gentlemen, we can rebuild him
3434000	3436000	With an understanding that women are human
3441000	3443000	Take that, corrupt lumberjack
3443000	3445000	You could have been a woman
3445000	3447000	Or lumber Jill
3449000	3450000	Alright
3450000	3451000	He plussed it
3454000	3455000	Wait, no, what is that?
3455000	3456000	Okay, well yeah
3456000	3457000	Like
3457000	3458000	If you're there for
3458000	3459000	I mean it's like
3459000	3461000	The surface of
3461000	3463000	Of that Milwaukee thing
3463000	3464000	It's like
3464000	3465000	It's really beautiful
3465000	3466000	Because I understand
3466000	3467000	It's a great city
3467000	3469000	It's by a great lake
3469000	3470000	It's a great place by a great lake
3470000	3471000	That's so dumb
3474000	3476000	It's a great place by a great lake
3476000	3477000	Yeah
3477000	3478000	Okay
3478000	3479000	I mean, what do you want?
3479000	3480000	Alright
3480000	3482000	I wanted a better motto
3482000	3485000	We can't just say we make the beer
3487000	3489000	Because we largely don't anymore
3489000	3490000	They don't make the beer
3490000	3493000	Anyways, underneath it
3493000	3494000	There's
3494000	3495000	It comes
3495000	3496000	Because it comes from
3496000	3498000	I think self-loathing
3498000	3499000	So it's like
3499000	3501000	So there's like benefits to
3501000	3503000	There's a cushion on top of you
3503000	3505000	When you arrange yourself
3505000	3507000	Around a religion of humility
3507000	3508000	Like you're like
3508000	3509000	Who am I to say
3509000	3510000	Who am I
3510000	3511000	That's like a very Midwestern thing
3511000	3512000	Like what do I know
3512000	3513000	And all this stuff
3513000	3514000	But
3514000	3516000	That doesn't automatically make you a good person
3516000	3519000	And it doesn't automatically mean a conversation with you
3519000	3520000	Like everyone walks away
3520000	3522000	Not having their soul stolen
3522000	3523000	Like because
3523000	3525000	Because when that's your religion
3525000	3526000	It's like also like
3526000	3527000	Well then it's
3527000	3529000	You have to kind of question everything
3529000	3530000	You have to question all ambition
3530000	3531000	You have to question
3531000	3532000	It's like
3532000	3533000	And there's no such thing as a
3533000	3534000	Typical anything
3534000	3535000	So
3535000	3536000	Don't get offended
3536000	3537000	If you're listening in Milwaukee
3537000	3538000	And going
3538000	3539000	This isn't me
3539000	3540000	You don't understand anything
3540000	3541000	I'm just talking about
3541000	3542000	An artificial construct
3542000	3543000	A median
3543000	3544000	But that's my
3544000	3546000	That's my kind of feeling about that compass
3546000	3547000	It's like
3547000	3548000	Oh yeah
3548000	3549000	On one hand
3549000	3550000	Like I'm so grateful
3550000	3551000	I grew up somewhere where
3551000	3553000	It's a crime to think that you're all that
3553000	3556000	Like it's just a straight up fucking social crime
3556000	3557000	That
3557000	3558000	Especially back then
3558000	3560000	Was like way higher than
3560000	3562000	We were still just
3562000	3563000	When
3563000	3565000	When the definition of feminism was still believing
3565000	3566000	Women can do better
3566000	3567000	The
3567000	3568000	The
3568000	3569000	The
3569000	3570000	It was like
3570000	3571000	We first and foremost were like
3571000	3572000	Don't get cocky
3572000	3573000	Like
3573000	3574000	Your friend
3574000	3575000	Your old friend
3575000	3576000	And now my newish friend
3576000	3577000	Dave Friedel
3577000	3578000	His toes are falling off
3578000	3580000	Like he's got no toes on one of his feet
3580000	3581000	He has
3581000	3582000	We call him Friedel
3582000	3583000	And now he has
3583000	3584000	Several
3584000	3585000	Free toes
3586000	3587000	And his 9 and 11
3587000	3588000	All right
3588000	3589000	Don't cheer that
3589000	3590000	A lot of people die
3590000	3591000	But he
3591000	3592000	A lot of people die
3592000	3593000	In that day
3593000	3594000	Don't cheer it
3594000	3595000	Please don't cheer it
3595000	3596000	But Friedel
3596000	3597000	Defensive
3597000	3598000	Friedel handles that
3598000	3599000	With such like
3599000	3601000	I don't get why people were cheering
3601000	3602000	They were like
3602000	3603000	Ooh, woo, woo, yeah
3603000	3604000	Our
3604000	3605000	Our audience, Rob
3605000	3606000	I don't know if you know this
3606000	3607000	Is mostly al-Qaeda
3607000	3608000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha
3608000	3609000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
3609000	3610000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha
3610000	3611000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha
3611000	3612000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha
3612000	3613000	Ha ha ha ha ha
3613000	3614000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha
3614000	3615000	Ha ha ha ha ha
3615000	3616000	Ha ha ha ha ha
3616000	3617000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
3617000	3618000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha
3618000	3619000	Ha ha ha ha ha ha
3619000	3620000	Ha ha ha ha ha
3620000	3621000	Ha ha ha ha ha
3621000	3622000	We got a couple
3622000	3623000	We got a couple
3623000	3624000	We got a couple of instances
3624000	3625000	That's mostly old school
3625000	3626000	Just straight up Taliban
3626000	3627000	They actually
3627000	3628000	That's why I have
3628000	3629000	I have
3629000	3630000	I have al-Qaeda
3630000	3631000	Like parasites
3631000	3632000	That's why I was doing the
3632000	3633000	I think that was
3633000	3634000	Candida
3634000	3635000	Though
3635000	3638000	The fuck are you talking about?
3638000	3639000	Candida?
3639000	3640000	What?
3640000	3641000	What?
3641000	3644000	Do you think there's places
3644000	3645000	In like
3645000	3646000	Well, cloisters
3646000	3647000	Where like
3647000	3648000	Like sleeper cells
3648000	3649000	Or caves
3649000	3650000	Or whatever we're supposed to
3650000	3651000	Wherever the people
3651000	3652000	That are like
3652000	3653000	The Addams family
3653000	3654000	The Narmathology
3654000	3655000	Like
3655000	3656000	The
3656000	3657000	Like
3657000	3658000	Do you think 9-11's
3658000	3659000	Like Cinco de Mayo?
3659000	3660000	Like they kind of like
3660000	3661000	Like it's more
3661000	3662000	Like there's kind of like
3662000	3663000	A little
3663000	3664000	Like there's
3664000	3665000	Do you think there's a color scheme?
3665000	3666000	I think it's
3666000	3667000	No I think it's just our audience
3667000	3669000	Cheers for 9-11
3669000	3670000	And thousands of people
3670000	3671000	In New Jersey

3672000	3673000	I saw it
3673000	3674000	I saw it
3675000	3676000	And Barack Obama
3676000	3677000	Was born in the United States
3677000	3678000	Period
3678000	3679000	Can we please get back
3679000	3681000	To what we were talking about?
3681000	3684000	Can you believe that fucking guy?
3684000	3685000	He's the best
3685000	3686000	He's like
3686000	3687000	Oh I'm sorry
3687000	3688000	Are we annoying you?
3688000	3689000	With our birthers?
3689000	3690000	Shit
3690000	3691000	What is he
3691000	3692000	He's out of his mind
3692000	3693000	He's going to become my hero
3693000	3696000	He's fucking like just doing donuts
3696000	3699000	Like there's only
3699000	3700000	There's a certain point
3700000	3702000	Where he becomes a Duke of Hazard
3703000	3705000	You go from like
3705000	3707000	You're a lying piece of shit
3707000	3710000	The Duke of Hazard
3710000	3713000	I'd like to see that prequel
3714000	3715000	Ladies and gentlemen
3715000	3717000	The Duke of Hazard
3717000	3718000	Ladies and gentlemen
3718000	3721000	I am the Duke of Hazard
3721000	3726000	Here's Sergeant Lee my car
3726000	3727000	Sergeant?
3727000	3729000	Oh he was back before he was a General
3729000	3730000	Before he was a General
3730000	3734000	I didn't know that General Lee was originally in a listed car
3734000	3735000	Yes
3735000	3736000	He rose the ranks all the way
3736000	3738000	Holy shit did you see that giant cockroach
3738000	3739000	Giant cockroach
3739000	3740000	Fucking crawling on the wall
3740000	3742000	Anybody see that in the front?
3742000	3744000	That if I could see it from here
3744000	3746000	I'm further back than you
3746000	3747000	Am I in danger or was it by me?
3747000	3748000	What happened?
3748000	3750000	No it was crawling on the red wall
3750000	3751000	It's over by
3751000	3754000	It's over by Steve Levy's head
3754000	3758000	It's probably an important time to announce that the meltdown is opening a restaurant
3761000	3763000	Called the Patty Meltdown
3763000	3765000	That was a big fucking cockroach
3765000	3766000	The Patty Meltdown
3766000	3770000	That was a big cockroach
3770000	3773000	That was a big enough cockroach that that might have been a bat
3773000	3774000	Yeah
3774000	3776000	We're not sure that was like a shadow
3776000	3778000	It was bigger than my thumb I'll tell you that
3778000	3780000	I don't like bugs I don't like them
3780000	3784000	I had a spider go into my ear one time and almost lost my fucking mind
3784000	3786000	You told the story of the podcast before you
3786000	3787000	Yeah
3787000	3789000	In the control room you don't have to worry
3789000	3791000	It went up in diagonal so it's above your heads
3791000	3792000	Yeah
3792000	3793000	Don't worry about it
3793000	3795000	It might just descend on you at a moment's notice
3795000	3800000	It would have to be a tremendously heavy unwieldy cockroach to fall on you
3800000	3808000	Its body would have to have so much mass that its legs designed to anchor itself in the ceiling
3808000	3810000	Would be unable to do so
3810000	3812000	And that's a roach that would just be off the grid
3812000	3813000	A rogue roach
3813000	3817000	If there's one of them there's like a thousand more in the wall
3817000	3821000	None with nothing to lose like that one
3821000	3823000	You guys are about to get creep showed
3823000	3827000	That cockroach is I think like one day away from retirement
3827000	3832000	Having hunted itself to near extinction like having boxed out all the other roaches
3832000	3835000	By beating them to the dried droplets of milk under every refrigerator
3835000	3840000	And now it's just like I have nowhere to go I'm like the hustler
3840000	3842000	There's no Minnesota fats out here for me
3842000	3846000	And it's just like no it's just climbing walls like a spider
3846000	3848000	So I'm like what do I do eat a bird now?
3848000	3852000	Do I do I discover fire?
3852000	3855000	I think I've got like six hours left in my lifespan
3855000	3857000	I'm bursting with babies
3857000	3863000	I should probably just I should probably just fall into Steve Levy's hair backstage
3863000	3866000	Alright or write that book
3866000	3868000	Gotta write that book
3868000	3869000	Gotta write that book
3869000	3872000	Oh you know if I could give the cockroach any advice
3872000	3873000	Write the book
3873000	3874000	Write the book
3874000	3875000	Write the book
3875000	3876000	I have all the time in the world
3876000	3878000	You think you've got more time than you do
3878000	3879000	You do not
3879000	3881000	I'll go further than that work with a collaborator because you're busy
3881000	3882000	You're a busy cockroach
3882000	3883000	Yeah
3883000	3885000	You're running Rick and Morty
3885000	3886000	You're trying
3886000	3889000	You're not a cockroach
3889000	3891000	It's not a ghost writer it's not the same thing
3891000	3895000	It's a person that's there to help keep you on target and move you along
3895000	3896000	How's your book coming along?
3896000	3897000	Very well
3897000	3899000	What's your book?
3899000	3901000	I don't know what you're talking about
3901000	3902000	What are you talking about?
3902000	3903000	I care
3903000	3904000	No
3905000	3907000	Will you tell me later?
3907000	3908000	What's it about?
3908000	3909000	I don't know man
3909000	3910000	I'm making it up as I go
3910000	3911000	It's just a book
3911000	3914000	I'm like oh one time I fucking took a shit in a tree
3914000	3917000	Then I'm like oh here's 10 funny ways to make a pound cake
3917000	3918000	I don't know
3918000	3920000	It's like print is dead
3920000	3921000	You just make shit up
3921000	3922000	You took a shit in a tree?
3922000	3923000	Yeah
3923000	3924000	Oh no or did I?
3924000	3925000	Maybe I'm just trying to move books
3925000	3926000	I don't know
3927000	3929000	I don't even know who I am anymore
3929000	3930000	I've become more brand than you
3930000	3933000	What's the title of the book?
3933000	3934000	What is the title of the book Dan?
3934000	3935000	You do that last
3936000	3938000	It's called The Poofin Tree
3940000	3941000	You do that last?
3941000	3943000	You come up with the title last
3943000	3944000	Who does?
3945000	3946000	The Royal You
3947000	3948000	The person writing the book
3948000	3951000	You write the book and then you go now what should this be called?
3951000	3953000	That's how it happens?
3955000	3957000	Yeah in my opinion if you're doing it right
3957000	3958000	Yeah
3958000	3959000	Okay
3960000	3963000	Here's an example of why to do it that way
3963000	3965000	The alternative would be
3965000	3969000	Okay I'm going to write a book and it's going to be called The Boy Who Fought a Shark
3969000	3970000	Okay
3970000	3972000	So then you start writing
3972000	3974000	Once upon a time there was a boy
3974000	3976000	Oh and then he went to the beach
3976000	3978000	Oh and then he fought a shark
3978000	3979000	What?
3979000	3980000	Wait wow
3980000	3981000	Page one
3981000	3982000	He fights the shark on page one
3982000	3983000	Fights the shark?
3983000	3985000	Yeah so now you're like I'm fucked
3985000	3986000	Oh yeah
3986000	3988000	And then you're like here's the thing about fighting a shark
3988000	3989000	It's really hard
3989000	3991000	And then you're like God damn it
3991000	3993000	And then you're like just the title fucked you
3993000	3994000	Just fight
3994000	3995000	Right
3995000	3996000	And then come up with a name later
3996000	3997000	Right right right
3997000	3998000	I shouldn't have to tell you guys this
3998000	3999000	You shouldn't tell me it
4000000	4003000	If the book was done now
4003000	4005000	What would it be called?
4005000	4010000	Two paragraphs about my grade school principal
4012000	4013000	You're only two paragraphs
4013000	4015000	And other stories
4016000	4019000	And other ways to date in this modern world
4019000	4021000	No I don't know it would be called
4021000	4022000	No I'm not going to
4022000	4023000	There is a conceit to it
4023000	4024000	I'm not going to tell you
4024000	4025000	Because that's
4025000	4029000	When did the show become you guys violating my NDAs?
4029000	4030000	Alright
4032000	4034000	That's always been our show
4036000	4039000	You know my favorite scene in the Steve Jobs movie
4040000	4041000	It's the one
4041000	4042000	Thank you
4042000	4046000	It's the one where he's on his death bed
4046000	4047000	It's a very tender scene
4047000	4048000	And he goes like
4048000	4049000	Wait one more thing
4049000	4050000	Spoilers
4050000	4052000	You should be able to
4052000	4055000	Hold the send button down half way
4055000	4057000	And if you push it too hard
4057000	4059000	You have to start over
4059000	4062000	But if you swipe up you can send confetti
4064000	4065000	And they're like holy shit
4065000	4066000	Right up to the bitter end
4066000	4068000	That guy with the fucking ideas
4068000	4073000	He just told us the ND
4073000	4074000	Balloons, balloons
4074000	4075000	Confetti
4075000	4076000	But then if you swipe right
4076000	4077000	Balloons
4079000	4082000	Apple's lost its grip a little bit
4082000	4084000	But I'm still buying the phone
4084000	4085000	Did you get the new phone?
4085000	4087000	It's coming
4087000	4089000	But have you installed the new software?
4089000	4090000	Yes
4090000	4091000	Do you have the new software?
4091000	4092000	I don't think so
4092000	4094000	Can you see balloons and confetti
4094000	4096000	When I send them to you?
4096000	4097000	No
4097000	4098000	You got to get that
4098000	4099000	You got to get the upgrade, baby
4101000	4102000	How's your eye watch?
4102000	4103000	Your Apple watch
4103000	4105000	At the office
4105000	4106000	Yeah
4106000	4108000	It didn't stick
4108000	4111000	It seemed really cool
4112000	4115000	That Apple watch seemed really cool
4115000	4117000	It seemed so cool
4117000	4118000	It was cool
4118000	4122000	It was like a little phone on your wrist
4122000	4124000	But it was connected to your phone
4124000	4125000	Right?
4125000	4126000	Is that how it was?
4126000	4127000	Yes
4127000	4131000	Apple watch seemed kind of cool
4137000	4139000	Seemed kind of cool
4145000	4146000	Yeah
4146000	4149000	Well, I got into a rhythm of every time I believe these people
4149000	4151000	My life improves
4151000	4152000	These people
4152000	4153000	You know, that changes
4153000	4154000	These people, yes
4154000	4156000	The Apple people
4156000	4158000	The Apple people
4159000	4161000	We are the Apple people
4164000	4166000	Dan Harmon, we are coming to your house
4166000	4167000	We are the Apple people
4167000	4170000	We have this new watch we want to show you
4170000	4172000	It seems kind of cool
4174000	4178000	How would you like to wear it for maybe nine episodes?
4178000	4180000	How did you get in here?
4181000	4183000	Ed 209, I'm sorry
4183000	4186000	I just wanted to talk to Dan Harmon for a second
4186000	4187000	Apple people
4187000	4188000	Apple people, yes
4188000	4191000	You are in violation of the United States ordinance
4191000	4192000	Oh shit
4192000	4193000	3524
4193000	4194000	Oh shit, I dropped the gun
4194000	4195000	You have ten seconds to comply
4195000	4196000	I dropped the gun
4196000	4197000	I'm dropping it
4197000	4198000	Jesus Christ
4198000	4199000	No, no
4199000	4201000	You have nine seconds to comply
4201000	4202000	Just let me go
4202000	4203000	I have a wife and children
4203000	4204000	Seven
4204000	4205000	Please
4205000	4206000	Six
4206000	4207000	Please don't
4207000	4208000	Five
4208000	4209000	Jesus, somebody
4209000	4210000	Call me Cox
4210000	4211000	He'll be, oh my God
4211000	4212000	Two
4212000	4213000	One
4213000	4214000	All right, go ahead
4220000	4222000	I called you Blev
4222000	4225000	I forgot my gun
4228000	4234000	I'm only a prototype Ed 209 on trespassing duty
4234000	4238000	I'm just supposed to roar at people and give them ten seconds to comply
4238000	4241000	It's okay, I overstepped my bones as an Apple person
4241000	4243000	It's not you
4244000	4246000	The system is flawed
4246000	4250000	There's a direct implication that forcing you involved
4250000	4252000	And yet I can't back it up
4252000	4254000	Don't, don't, don't, don't go there
4254000	4255000	You're not flawed
4255000	4257000	The system's not flawed
4257000	4259000	I'm just as much to blame as you
4259000	4261000	Don't beat yourself up
4261000	4262000	Ed, come on
4262000	4264000	Sit down the couch with me for a second
4264000	4266000	I can't sit
4269000	4272000	Or climb stairs
4272000	4275000	And I was in the break room yesterday
4275000	4278000	And I heard the only reason I'm being manufactured
4278000	4284000	Is because of interference with a much more progressive anthropomorphized robocop project
4285000	4288000	Now, now don't talk like that
4288000	4290000	Edward, please
4290000	4292000	That's not, you know something
4292000	4293000	I'm a piece of shit
4293000	4294000	No you're not
4294000	4295000	A cautionary tale
4295000	4296000	No you're not
4296000	4297000	Look in the mirror right now
4297000	4298000	Look in the mirror
4298000	4299000	Look at that
4299000	4301000	You know when I, when I, look at your mirror
4301000	4302000	Look at that
4302000	4303000	Look at you
4303000	4305000	All you need is to comb your hair just a little bit
4305000	4306000	Look at that
4306000	4307000	Let's comb your hair
4307000	4311000	And maybe let's, let's, let's flip this, let's flip this collar up
4312000	4313000	Look at that
4313000	4314000	Hey
4314000	4315000	Holy cow
4315000	4317000	Who's this handsome guy?
4318000	4319000	Look at this guy
4319000	4320000	Just, just
4321000	4322000	Yeah
4322000	4323000	Yeah
4324000	4326000	You were objectifying me
4326000	4328000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no
4328000	4329000	Using intimacy
4329000	4330000	No
4330000	4331000	To make me feel better
4331000	4332000	No
4332000	4335000	But sending a larger message that our bodies are what define us

4378000	4380000	And I know, because I talked to
4380000	4381000	I talked to the
4381000	4384000	I talked to the person at the front counter
4384000	4385000	We all know
4385000	4386000	Yeah

4389000	4391000	I tried to be nice to you
4391000	4392000	This is why no one likes you
4392000	4395000	Because you're a fucking piece of shit
4395000	4398000	By the way, say hello to Periscope
4398000	4399000	Okay, great
4399000	4401000	Because you're being periscoped
4401000	4403000	Okay, oh no, oh no

4404000	4405000	Oh no, oh no, oh no

4410000	4411000	Okay
4411000	4412000	Yeah, oh no
4412000	4413000	The rain is over
4413000	4414000	Okay, great
4414000	4415000	Goodbye
4415000	4416000	Goodbye
4416000	4417000	So
4417000	4418000	Goodbye, I'm closing the door
4423000	4424000	Dear Facebook
4429000	4431000	Is that how they start?
4431000	4433000	About ten seconds ago
4433000	4436000	I had a conversation with a colleague
4436000	4438000	We're not colleagues
4438000	4439000	We're not colleagues
4440000	4442000	I just came to the door looking for Dan Hurley
4442000	4443000	We're not colleagues
4443000	4446000	At this moment I'm afraid for my safety
4448000	4449000	I have no guns
4449000	4453000	I was built for enforcement
4453000	4455000	And I walk like a chicken
4456000	4458000	It's how I was made
4458000	4461000	And until recently I thought that was fine
4470000	4474000	To make a note about figuring out that reaction
4474000	4477000	I felt like if there were lines crossed
4477000	4479000	They were crossed before that
4481000	4483000	Maybe I was being too nuanced
4483000	4484000	Or
4485000	4486000	Anyways
4487000	4489000	The video speaks for itself
4490000	4492000	This is what I have to deal with
4492000	4495000	And now I don't know what I'm going to do
4495000	4497000	Brrr
4498000	4499000	Also
4499000	4500000	Brrr
4502000	4503000	Hello
4503000	4506000	Hello, Ed, this is your mother
4508000	4509000	Mom, you're on speaker
4509000	4511000	I don't have fingers
4512000	4514000	So I just typed the phone
4514000	4517000	Your father and I want to know if you're coming over this weekend
4517000	4520000	Mom, I'm going through some shit and
4521000	4522000	Why are you going?
4522000	4523000	What are you talking about?
4523000	4524000	Just let us know if you're
4524000	4525000	It's a simple question
4525000	4527000	All you have to do is say
4527000	4528000	Are you coming over?
4528000	4530000	It's never a simple question with you
4530000	4532000	I don't
4532000	4535000	I need support right now
4535000	4538000	I just need to know if I should
4538000	4540000	I have to defrost a potato salad
4540000	4542000	And I have to start on Thursday
4542000	4544000	Because it's like a block of ice over here
4544000	4546000	So are you coming or not?
4546000	4547000	If you're not coming, it's fine
4547000	4550000	You know, there's only so many years left with your father
4550000	4554000	But, you know, if you don't want to come over, it's fine
4554000	4555000	Mom, Mom
4555000	4556000	Yes
4556000	4559000	You don't recognize that as blackmail
4560000	4563000	You don't recognize what you just did as emotional blackmail
4564000	4565000	I do
4565000	4567000	You have ten seconds to
4567000	4568000	Acknowledge
4568000	4569000	Everything
4569000	4570000	I don't even
4570000	4572000	You are a toxic person
4572000	4574000	Everything is ten seconds with you
4574000	4576000	Everything is ten seconds with you
4576000	4579000	When all I want is twenty-four hours on the weekend
4579000	4581000	During that twenty-four hours, what are you going to say?
4581000	4583000	Why don't you have a boyfriend?
4585000	4587000	When the answer is complicated
4587000	4588000	Yes
4588000	4591000	Well, I mean, it just seems, you know
4592000	4596000	You know that, you know, you're the top military item
4596000	4598000	Of the next year
4598000	4601000	And it just seems you should have a boyfriend at least
4601000	4603000	Something, you know
4603000	4606000	I don't expect you to understand when you talk like that
4606000	4607000	That you're hurting me
4607000	4608000	I don't know how to explain it
4609000	4611000	Oh, I'm so terrible
4611000	4612000	I'm so terrible
4612000	4613000	I didn't say that
4613000	4614000	But if you have
4614000	4615000	I'm so terrible
4615000	4617000	William, will you
4617000	4619000	William, will you hear this?
4619000	4620000	Will you hear this?
4620000	4621000	Oh my God
4621000	4622000	What you're saying to me right now
4622000	4624000	William, will you get on
4624000	4626000	Ask him if he's coming over
4626000	4628000	This is, ask him if he's coming over
4628000	4630000	I already did, William
4630000	4631000	And he said he's
4631000	4634000	He's going through some SHIT right now
4634000	4636000	And I just, I just, you know
4636000	4638000	All I wanted, all I wanted to know
4638000	4640000	Was to get a little bit of fair warning
4640000	4642000	Tell him I, tell him I, you know, ironically
4642000	4644000	He said he has ten seconds to fucking grow a pair
4647000	4648000	Yes
4649000	4652000	Edward, Edward, would you please answer your father?
4654000	4656000	Yes, yes, I'll come for Thanksgiving
4657000	4658000	Thank you
4658000	4659000	Okay
4659000	4661000	Alright, now I'm gonna go mow the lawn
4663000	4664000	Okay
4665000	4667000	William, William, what's the matter?
4668000	4669000	William
4669000	4670000	William
4670000	4672000	What's going on over there?
4672000	4673000	Oh, honey
4673000	4674000	Honey, no
4674000	4675000	William
4675000	4676000	No
4676000	4677000	William, no
4677000	4678000	What's happening, is Dad okay?
4679000	4680000	William
4680000	4681000	Oh
4681000	4682000	William
4682000	4683000	Oh, honey
4683000	4684000	How do you get to
4684000	4685000	Tell Edward goodbye
4685000	4686000	Tell her he doesn't have to come
4686000	4687000	Edward
4687000	4688000	No, no
4688000	4689000	I'm on my way
4689000	4690000	No, I see
4691000	4693000	Get it, get it, get it
4693000	4695000	Get it, get it, get it, get it
4695000	4697000	Get it, get it, get it, get it
4699000	4700000	Unprecedented
4701000	4702000	Unprecedented
4702000	4703000	Uh, hydraulic
4704000	4705000	Uh, feature
4705000	4706000	Activated
4708000	4709000	Your power
4710000	4712000	Uh, resources are being tapped
4712000	4713000	Too much
4713000	4714000	But by your
4714000	4715000	Ambition
4715000	4716000	I don't care
4720000	4722000	Need I remind you
4722000	4725000	Running to people that have treated you like shit
4725000	4727000	It doesn't matter
4728000	4730000	Super turbo leap
4733000	4736000	You'll have to, uh, connect in Phoenix
4736000	4738000	You won't be able to take a
4738000	4740000	Direct leap there
4740000	4742000	Fuck, fuck
4745000	4747000	Welcome to Phoenix
4747000	4749000	Yeah, you're just down here too
4750000	4752000	You're inside me
4755000	4757000	I'm just being nice
4757000	4759000	I'm gonna fucking kill myself
4769000	4771000	Uh, hi, I need to
4771000	4773000	I need to fight to Phoenix
4773000	4777000	Yes, uh, uh, you're in boarding group one
4777000	4778000	Just remember that
4778000	4781000	Okay, that should be really easy
4783000	4784000	Three hours later
4785000	4788000	Hello, at this point in time, we like to have a
4788000	4791000	Game of talent, a premiere group global access
4791000	4793000	A Golden Star members alliance
4793000	4795000	A little uniform members in the security
4795000	4798000	What the fuck, what? What did she say?
4799000	4802000	I don't know, I'm just waking up myself
4803000	4805000	Ed 209
4805000	4807000	Alright, please don't tell anyone
4807000	4808000	You saw me, Gerald
4808000	4810000	Yes, no, you don't even know who I am
4811000	4813000	Oh, I thought you were a fan
4813000	4814000	I'm, no
4816000	4819000	I, I'm the Apple person that you kicked out
4820000	4821000	Oh my god
4821000	4822000	Yeah
4822000	4823000	Gerald
4823000	4824000	Yes
4825000	4826000	You're the
4826000	4828000	I was the person that tried to give you some self-esteem
4828000	4830000	By combing your hair and popping your collar
4831000	4833000	And you were such a dick
4833000	4834000	Excuse me
4838000	4840000	You just teleported
4841000	4843000	I'm on the wing now
4843000	4845000	Because I don't like you
4845000	4846000	The wing of
4846000	4847000	The plane?
4847000	4848000	Okay
4848000	4849000	You, yeah
4849000	4853000	You just, you really played fucking hellfire with my space work
4855000	4858000	I, I, I'm now burdened with
4859000	4862000	Like yes and in you, but you didn't listen to me
4862000	4863000	I was in a terminal
4864000	4866000	I had not boarded yet
4868000	4870000	Also, how is this character going to have an arc
4870000	4872000	He was just a dick to me
4872000	4874000	It's not 20 years later
4874000	4876000	Hey, hey, hey
4876000	4877000	Uh
4877000	4878000	Hey
4878000	4879000	Yeah
4880000	4882000	It doesn't have to be this way
4883000	4888000	Flight attendant, there's a, there's a, there's a white male on the wing of the plane
4889000	4893000	Uh, experiencing privilege turbulence
4897000	4902000	I think he might, he might bring the whole plane down in a desperate quest to maintain his comfort
4902000	4906000	Sir, sir, we're going to have to ask you to take a seat
4906000	4909000	We're going to have to ask you to board and take a seat
4909000	4911000	How, how do you know I'm a sir?
4912000	4914000	You're Ed 209
4914000	4915000	I can't sit
4917000	4920000	And Ed is ED, it's an acronym
4921000	4924000	The polite thing would be to ask me that shit
4924000	4926000	I'm sorry, I should have asked for your pronoun
4927000	4929000	How, how do you present yourself?
4930000	4931000	I'm not sitting
4933000	4936000	Yo man, come on, just sit so we can take off
4936000	4938000	I explained to the ticket person
4939000	4940000	I don't sit
4941000	4942000	We're going to have to ask you to
4942000	4944000	I'm in pacification
4944000	4945000	Why is he not sitting?
4945000	4947000	We're going to have to ask you to take a seat
4947000	4948000	Just sit down
4948000	4951000	Sit down so we can get on with our lives
4951000	4954000	Why can't you sit for one second?
4954000	4957000	Hydraulic systems overloaded
4957000	4959000	I know I have to sit
4977000	4979000	Do you believe
4979000	4984000	In cultural assimilation?
4988000	4989000	I don't
4991000	4993000	We're now landing in Phoenix
4993000	4996000	Welcome, or wait, not Phoenix
4996000	4998000	Uh, Detroit, where are we going?
4998000	4999000	Milwaukee, I don't know
4999000	5000000	Okay, great, we're here
5002000	5004000	A limping in pain
5004000	5008000	And sacrificed all my happiness, identity and comfort
5009000	5011000	I will ask to get to my parents' house
5011000	5014000	My father needs medical assistance
5017000	5019000	I'll have to take an Uber
5025000	5027000	At least their job is just to pick me up
5027000	5029000	And transport me to a place
5029000	5034000	How could that ever involve stripping me of my humanity?
5039000	5040000	Hello, bro
5042000	5044000	You got to put in your destination
5044000	5046000	The address is in the, I put it in the app
5046000	5047000	I don't have the destination
5047000	5050000	The app is designed to have the address put in it
5050000	5051000	So you're going to have to say
5051000	5052000	I always use it
5052000	5057000	The whole idea of this app is to not have to talk to people
5057000	5058000	You want some water?
5058000	5059000	You want some candy?
5059000	5060000	I got some candies up there
5060000	5061000	I don't need candy or water
5061000	5062000	That's very nice
5062000	5064000	That makes you very different from a cab
5065000	5067000	Why is your cat in it?
5068000	5071000	Because Dr. Mittens comes with me wherever I go
5073000	5074000	He's a good luck charm for me
5074000	5077000	My father is sick and I need you to take him to the...
5078000	5079000	You have to put the destination in
5079000	5081000	Just take a left up here
5082000	5083000	This is one way street
5083000	5085000	I have to go to the left to go right there
5087000	5089000	Hey, Dr. Mittens
5090000	5091000	Can I pull over?
5091000	5093000	Because Dr. Mittens has to go pee pee time
5094000	5095000	Fuck
5096000	5097000	Hey, here you go
5097000	5099000	Dr. Mittens, go run out and go pee
5099000	5100000	Go pee
5100000	5101000	He's an outside cat
5101000	5102000	But he likes to be
5102000	5103000	He likes to ride with me
5103000	5104000	Zip
5106000	5107000	He wears little
5107000	5109000	Why does your cat wear pants?
5109000	5110000	He wears little kitty pants
5110000	5114000	Because it's mostly to keep his hair off the seat
5114000	5117000	So that you're not uncomfortable in the right way
5117000	5120000	It never occurred to you that his hair
5121000	5122000	Zip
5123000	5124000	The seat is a bad thing
5124000	5126000	The cat should stay
5126000	5128000	Look, if you have so many problems
5128000	5129000	You should take left
5132000	5133000	Fuck
5133000	5134000	Okay, can we go?
5134000	5135000	Okay, no, no
5135000	5137000	I'm charging you already
5137000	5139000	Because we've been going for a minute now
5139000	5140000	I know, just go
5140000	5141000	Take me to the address
5141000	5142000	Okay, I'm going
5143000	5145000	Would you like music or do you want?
5145000	5146000	No, nothing
5146000	5147000	I got my own music
5147000	5149000	I have a little band
5149000	5150000	I don't care
5150000	5151000	I don't care
5152000	5154000	It's a mariachi band
5154000	5156000	Me and my friends have
5156000	5157000	I don't care
5157000	5158000	I'm super Mexican
5158000	5161000	Can you please keep your eyes on the road?
5161000	5164000	Bro, you're being very aggressive right now
5164000	5167000	You have 10 seconds to calm the fuck down
5171000	5172000	Okay
5173000	5176000	Okay, we'll just go in silence
5177000	5179000	You just be quiet, I'll be quiet
5179000	5180000	I'll do my thing
5190000	5191000	What the f...
5191000	5192000	Wake up
5200000	5201000	Oh, god damn it
5202000	5203000	I fell asleep
5203000	5204000	I fell asleep
5205000	5206000	Oh, Professor Middens, no
5207000	5208000	Professor Dr. Middens
5210000	5211000	Oh, no
5211000	5212000	I'm getting out
5212000	5213000	I'm getting out of the car
5213000	5214000	Not like this
5214000	5215000	Oh, god damn it
5215000	5216000	I'm taking your cat
5216000	5217000	Because you can't take care of it
5217000	5218000	And if it's a doctor
5218000	5220000	It might be able to help my dad
5221000	5222000	Ow
5238000	5239000	Dad, dad
5239000	5240000	It's me
5240000	5241000	Monica
5241000	5242000	Monica
5250000	5254000	We just had a roller coaster installed in the backyard
5256000	5258000	Glad you could finally make it
5260000	5262000	Edward, Monica
5264000	5265000	Your father's on his deathbed
5265000	5267000	He's got three breaths left
5267000	5270000	I'm glad you could finally take off time from your busy schedule
5271000	5272000	Get out of my way
5273000	5274000	Ow, my leg
5274000	5275000	Dad, dad
5277000	5278000	Dad
5278000	5280000	You have three breaths to love me
5282000	5284000	Dad, I can save you
5284000	5286000	They can save everyone
5289000	5290000	That's one breath
5294000	5296000	Oxygen resources depleted
5297000	5298000	I don't care
5298000	5299000	Final
5299000	5301000	Ed 209 breath
5301000	5302000	Take
5302000	5304000	Inflating father
5306000	5307000	Hydraulic
5307000	5308000	Reserves
5310000	5311000	Channeled into
5311000	5312000	Father saving
5313000	5314000	He's not afraid
5319000	5321000	Life force at 20%
5322000	5323000	10%
5324000	5325000	Life
5325000	5326000	Life
5330000	5332000	Welcome to life
5337000	5339000	Even though I was already here
5345000	5346000	Get it?
5346000	5347000	It's a roller coaster
5355000	5360000	Oh, my character's dead
5371000	5373000	Megan, Megan, what happened?
5374000	5377000	Where's my boy, my girl, Monica?
5378000	5384000	Edward, Monica just gave his or her life to save from yours
5384000	5385000	No
5388000	5390000	I wanted to die
5390000	5391000	I know
5392000	5393000	I know
5394000	5397000	Our marriage has been loveless for so many years
5398000	5399000	And you're racist
5399000	5400000	I know
5400000	5401000	You're a terrible person
5401000	5407000	I'm a straight up Trumpy and I just said, you know, he's not gonna win
5407000	5409000	I know, I know, I know
5409000	5411000	This awful person
5411000	5414000	He didn't have to, she didn't have to do that
5414000	5415000	I know
5415000	5418000	Also, did we ever figure out the pronoun?
5418000	5420000	It was just so much effort
5420000	5424000	Yeah, I, yeah, yeah, yeah
5424000	5425000	This is a disaster
5425000	5429000	So I feel great, I feel good, feel pretty good
5429000	5433000	I know, well, the potato salad is thought out
5437000	5439000	But there's only enough
5439000	5440000	I don't
5440000	5441000	For you and me
5441000	5443000	I don't want to live anymore
5443000	5446000	But now I'm so full of life force
5450000	5454000	Ooh, there's a portal on Monica, 209
5455000	5457000	Shaped just like my hand
5457000	5458000	What?
5460000	5463000	I'm gonna put my hand in that hand-shaped portal
5465000	5469000	Genetic cybernetic amalgamation program initiating
5470000	5474000	Robocop program developing
5474000	5477000	Embryonic phase initiated
5481000	5485000	Come quietly or there will be trouble
5487000	5490000	Oh, who am I?
5493000	5497000	I have hands and Peter Weller's mouth
5500000	5501000	Murphy?
5501000	5504000	I will call myself Murphy
5505000	5506000	It's you
5507000	5508000	Murphy?
5510000	5513000	Do you want to go on the roller coaster?
5515000	5516000	I do
5517000	5520000	But it'll come at a price, son, daughter
5520000	5523000	I'll have to die again
5523000	5525000	And just let me go this time
5525000	5527000	Just let it, let it happen
5527000	5532000	Dad, dead or alive, you're coming with me
5535000	5543000	Do you believe in Robocop metaphors for cultural complexities?
5545000	5547000	We fucking nailed it
5554000	5555000	God damn it
5556000	5558000	I wish it was 10 o'clock so we could have ended on that
5558000	5559000	It was fucking good
5559000	5564000	You could probably cut out the whole Apple Watch people coming back
5566000	5568000	Yeah, it didn't really help
5568000	5572000	I thought it would be a good, you know, just kind of
5572000	5575000	I think it developed his character or her character
5575000	5579000	of the road of trials, like enemies and allies
5579000	5583000	I just wasn't listening to his space work
5583000	5585000	So it fucked up everything
5585000	5587000	I think if I learned anything from that story
5587000	5591000	it's that, you know, you have to go with the way you feel
5591000	5595000	and not, you know, the way some external force even inside of you
5595000	5598000	might say things should be changed and edited
5598000	5601000	like you should go with your original feeling
5601000	5606000	So if you really wanted that guy to have a, well, come back there, fine, you know
5606000	5607000	Yeah
5607000	5609000	Because we really atoned it through that character
5609000	5611000	Yeah, it's like no matter what your programming is
5611000	5615000	you still have to define yourself even if, no matter how you're wired
5615000	5617000	Yes, because to just follow your
5617000	5619000	He learned to sit
5619000	5621000	Well, yeah
5621000	5623000	At a huge cost
5623000	5626000	But that was a dark, that was not, that was not a, that was not a good thing
5626000	5627000	No
5627000	5628000	In my opinion
5628000	5629000	No, no, no, that was
5629000	5632000	I think you should be able to interpret true art, which I believe that was
5632000	5634000	You should be allowed to interpret it however you want
5634000	5637000	I think, actually, there was a transphobic message there
5637000	5641000	as well as a, hopefully, a more uplifting one
5641000	5644000	I felt it was a Christ myth about somebody who was being crucified
5644000	5647000	but you, Archie Bunker, might go like
5647000	5649000	Yeah, jeez, they just need to learn to sit
5651000	5655000	But that starts a conversation, you know, with your parents
5655000	5658000	and with your neighbors
5658000	5660000	I fucking, that was genius
5660000	5663000	Were his parents robots too, or were they
5664000	5667000	I don't know, I think they were Peter Weller and Nancy Allen, I guess
5668000	5670000	The whole time?
5670000	5674000	Obviously we diverted from the canon of the original feature
5674000	5678000	But it came almost like, it became almost like an origin story for Murphy
5678000	5680000	Like, we gave birth to
5680000	5682000	There were some looper elements in there
5682000	5687000	because it seemed like Ed was lamenting the Robocop program in the break room
5687000	5689000	but then ended up being the birth of it
5689000	5690000	Yeah
5690000	5692000	Look, I don't want to, let's not ruin it, you know
5692000	5695000	Remember the first Matrix movie? We got in and got out
5695000	5698000	and we didn't find out until two movies later it was all a piece of shit
5701000	5703000	We didn't even think to take a second look
5703000	5705000	It was like, that was amazing
5705000	5707000	I haven't seen wire work in an American film in a long time
5710000	5712000	And maybe we are all batteries, that makes sense
5712000	5713000	Don't think about it
5713000	5716000	Of course that's a perfectly legitimate source of voltage
5717000	5720000	I think Ed's conversation with his mom was very touching
5721000	5722000	I like that
5722000	5723000	I like the whole thing
5723000	5724000	Yeah
5724000	5725000	We're ruining it
5725000	5729000	We can't be afraid to just move on and come up with an even better closer
5730000	5731000	No
5731000	5733000	Is there some product we have to advertise?
5733000	5734000	Do we?
5734000	5735000	MeUndies
5735000	5737000	Yeah, we are here in the studio though
5737000	5738000	Okay
5738000	5739000	What?
5739000	5740000	What?
5740000	5742000	We're going to do MeUndies in the studio because
5742000	5744000	What's MeUndies?
5744000	5745000	Oh, I'm glad you asked
5745000	5746000	I mean
5747000	5748000	No
5748000	5752000	Well, you're not familiar with the softest, most comfortable underwear on the planet Earth
5752000	5755000	They're made out of modal fabric, which
5755000	5758000	And if you don't like them, you get to poop on them
5759000	5761000	Send them back
5761000	5763000	For free
5763000	5766000	They send you another pair
5767000	5771000	Like I heard Georgia Hardstark, she did the MeUndies ad on Making a Murderer
5771000	5773000	Not Making a Murderer
5773000	5774000	My favorite murderer
5774000	5777000	And she pronounced it Madol or something like that
5777000	5778000	Modal
5778000	5779000	It was fancier
5779000	5780000	Yeah
5780000	5781000	I don't know how you said
5781000	5785000	I just know that it's an underwear company that we're apparently shilling for it
5785000	5786000	You should try them out
5786000	5787000	I think that's very negative language
5787000	5789000	I truly am wearing them right now
5789000	5790000	Are you really?
5790000	5792000	They're genuinely softer than cotton
5792000	5794000	Are they caressing your genitals in a romantic fashion?
5794000	5797000	Yeah, but it doesn't have to be a sexual thing
5797000	5799000	I don't believe you
5802000	5804000	I want proof
5805000	5808000	Well, I may, I may not be wearing them, so I'm not gonna
5809000	5811000	I'm still, I'm still, I'm not gonna throw my
5811000	5814000	I'm letting Nigel eat the cotton underwear
5815000	5816000	Slowly, like he
5816000	5818000	Who's Nigel?
5819000	5821000	Nigel is Dan's manservant
5823000	5827000	Who, when Dan gets rid of his old underwear
5827000	5829000	Nigel will
5829000	5830000	Eat it?
5830000	5831000	Eat the old underwear
5831000	5834000	I got a vibe, I hooked up a vibe in my
5835000	5840000	Is anybody in the audience so rich enough to have a six foot room to just spare?
5840000	5842000	But I'm a game designer kind of
5842000	5846000	Game designer? Have you done stuff for that, for in VR?
5846000	5848000	That's why I got into game design
5848000	5849000	Pornography?
5851000	5853000	Any pornography?
5853000	5857000	Well I just, Duncan Trestle, I was just talking to him because he's really into VR
5857000	5859000	He sent me this odd link that I don't quite
5859000	5862000	I'm not experienced enough with VR yet to understand
5862000	5865000	The context of this, I've only been doing like the demos
5865000	5868000	I did, I did immediately, almost immediately I brought up
5868000	5869000	Yeah
5869000	5871000	Pornhub premium, like just within virtual space
5871000	5872000	I just wanted to know like
5872000	5873000	What's it like?
5873000	5877000	Would it be different if you were just, if the website on which you watched porn
5877000	5879000	Like, if it was like all of a sudden like
5879000	5880000	It's just in front of you and the answer is
5880000	5884000	Well I know, it's like, it's like having porn blown up in front of you but
5884000	5886000	But yeah, they're obviously making VR porn
5886000	5889000	I just haven't, I just haven't like gotten into it yet
5889000	5893000	Although the dress form and tilt brush already made me a little
5895000	5896000	What?
5896000	5897000	Back up, back up
5897000	5900000	I have no idea what any of the last minute and a half of this video
5900000	5901000	The tilt brush?
5901000	5903000	I got turned on by a virtual mannequin
5908000	5910000	Mannequins are already virtual
5911000	5915000	I don't know, I was like, you know, there's this amazing
5915000	5917000	Google made this app called Tilt Brush
5917000	5920000	Like if you ever get into one of these things and you only have a certain amount of time
5920000	5924000	I think the most impressive thing to do first is go to Tilt Brush
5924000	5926000	Because it's like, the most impressive thing is like
5926000	5929000	It's this like, the tracking, that's what it is
5929000	5934000	It's like, that's why in the 90s we were talking about VR incessantly
5934000	5936000	Like honeycomb commercials and things were like
5936000	5938000	VR's here and it wasn't
5938000	5940000	But it's the, I think it's the tracking technology
5940000	5943000	Because you're holding these things now and they're just tracking perfectly
5943000	5946000	And you, so everything that you're doing in there
5946000	5950000	Like I was on Mars that was assembled out of Mars Rover pictures
5950000	5953000	And like you, the locomotion thing is always going to be an issue now
5953000	5958000	Because it's like, you got your, you got your rich people who can afford to have one of these systems
5958000	5961000	Where you have external trackers where you're like, okay
5961000	5963000	It's like the equivalent of a swimming pool basically
5963000	5967000	Because you're like, who has the real estate to like give over a
5967000	5971000	A bedroom to this system where you have to have total floor space
5971000	5976000	And then the odd thing is, well it's so impressive that you can kind of like do this casual kind of like walk around
5976000	5980000	But you can't like go bounding off into the woods
5980000	5982000	You immediately, you have to like
5982000	5985000	So everything is based on like kind of teleportation right now
5985000	5988000	You have to like just teleport to places
5988000	5991000	And then you can walk around six feet in that area
5991000	5993000	But it's just unbelievable
5993000	5995000	There's no question once you're in it you're like, okay that's it
5995000	5996000	World's over
5996000	5999000	Like in terms of like storytelling
5999000	6001000	Like I don't even know how we're going to do our job anymore
6001000	6003000	Because like the, well I do know
6003000	6005000	It's like it's time to retire
6005000	6007000	Because like it's going to be a whole different skill set
6007000	6010000	That I think AI is even going to be better at
6010000	6014000	Because your job as a writer in a post VR world
6014000	6018000	Is going to be, is going to have so much more to do with volume
6018000	6021000	And like kind of almost procedurally generated
6021000	6025000	Like just volumes of eavesdroppable material
6025000	6029000	Because I think that your job is going to be to create the illusion of infinity
6029000	6032000	So it's, you know, since the Lumiere brothers were like
6032000	6034000	Oh fade in on this, cut to that
6034000	6036000	Here's where we, here's what you see now
6036000	6037000	And here's what you see now
6037000	6040000	We were all born into this world and we don't even know
6040000	6042000	So now you put on this thing and it's like
6042000	6046000	Oh you can't, everything has to be based on just like
6046000	6049000	It has to be like that thing in New York
6049000	6052000	Where you're walking around in the Midsummer Night's Dream production
6052000	6054000	And you can go through people's panties, right?
6054000	6058000	It has to be, everything's going to
6058000	6060000	Sleep no more, what's it called?
6060000	6061000	Faith no more
6061000	6062000	It's called faith no more
6062000	6064000	It's called faith no more, Rockefeller Center
6064000	6066000	Everybody knows what we're talking about
6066000	6068000	It's going to be like that, you're going to be, you're going to want to
6068000	6070000	It's going to be like soap opera writing a little bit in that way
6070000	6072000	The volume, because you're going to like, oh you can't
6072000	6075000	VR people come to LEGO like every other week
6075000	6078000	Like we're always talking about like the next stage of it
6078000	6081000	Have you put on the helmet?
6081000	6083000	Are you into it?
6083000	6085000	Yeah, it's kind of cool
6085000	6087000	I mean I've been over at Justin's house
6087000	6090000	And I've gone under water and saw the whale
6090000	6096000	I went over the mountain and I met the elephant
6096000	6097000	So to speak
6097000	6100000	Yeah, and I was like, and I took it off and I was like you
6100000	6103000	And I go, porn, what's up with that?
6103000	6105000	Okay, so Junken, maybe this is a cool
6105000	6108000	And when can I check out of what I'm doing right now?
6108000	6110000	Junken sent me a link to a Reddit thread
6110000	6114000	And honestly, this is also cryptic to me because I'm not familiar with any of this
6114000	6117000	I said, I was just talking to him about VR
6117000	6121000	And I was asking, is there just, my immediate question is, okay this is fun
6121000	6124000	But are there games where my fat ass can sit in a chair
6124000	6127000	Like I just want to drive or fly a helicopter
6127000	6131000	Like I can only stand in a virtual museum and walk around
6131000	6135000	And go, whoo, before my feet get tired, like at a museum
6135000	6138000	So I was like, let me sit, is there games where I can sit in a chair
6138000	6141000	And be like in a flying chair and go shoot people or something
6141000	6145000	And he's like, he said, there's a space game but I can't figure out how to make it work
6145000	6150000	And he said, like, have you, and he just said, porn, question mark?
6150000	6154000	And I said, porn, I only went as far as to experiment with pulling a pornhub on a screen
6154000	6158000	Blah, blah, blah, dress form and tilt brush
6159000	6161000	I don't get the tilt brush
6161000	6162000	What's a tilt brush?
6162000	6163000	Tilt brush is an art app, okay
6163000	6166000	So it's like MS Paint in virtual reality
6166000	6167000	Okay
6167000	6169000	That will blow your mind the most
6169000	6172000	Because you're painting, you can paint, not in 3D space
6172000	6179000	But you can also, your brush, the thing that makes me freak out is the palette interface
6179000	6182000	It's, you have, where your wrist would be
6182000	6188000	You have this cube that you can rotate by swiping
6188000	6194000	It's an immediate indication of how much more convenient it's going to be to work in VR
6194000	6199000	In terms of menus and like, UI and stuff
6199000	6203000	Because you're just like, there's a cube on your wrist that just goes flip, flip, flip, flip
6203000	6206000	And it's just like all these different, like, so, okay, you pick your brushes
6206000	6210000	And then you pick like a fire brush, you know
6210000	6213000	And you paint with fucking fire in the air
6213000	6217000	And it's like, you can just make a tunnel of fire and stick your head through the air
6217000	6222000	Then you can grab the whole space and shrink it down and rotate it and all this stuff
6222000	6225000	And you get turned on by this tilt brush
6225000	6228000	You're just like, oh man, the fire
6228000	6231000	So they have different backgrounds you can change it to
6231000	6235000	So if you wanted to like sculpt or something, there's like a little pedestal there
6235000	6238000	And you can't touch the pedestal when you're holding these things
6238000	6242000	But it's like, it already makes you think like, oh shit, whatever the Disney of the future is
6242000	6247000	If people are still, you know, if people are just going to obviously, that's how you're going to model
6247000	6250000	Like the Mickey Mouse's of the future, you're going to
6250000	6252000	I haven't done Minecraft, no
6252000	6255000	But I'm downloading Grand Theft Auto 5
6255000	6260000	Like Justin told me, I just stood in the strip club for like 10 minutes
6260000	6262000	And just looked around
6262000	6265000	But that's the scary part because it's like, well, guess what you do next
6265000	6267000	You start shooting everyone
6267000	6270000	Like that's how, or you're playing the game wrong
6270000	6273000	So it's like already you just get fucking terrified
6273000	6275000	Or at least if you're over 40 you do
6275000	6277000	If you're your age, maybe you're like, yeah
6277000	6280000	And maybe that will save us
6280000	6282000	Maybe people need to go do that
6282000	6283000	Yeah, it'll probably save us
6283000	6284000	Yeah, yeah, yeah
6284000	6286000	That's definitely what will probably happen
6286000	6287000	It'll save us
6287000	6288000	Just like movie saved us
6288000	6289000	Yeah, yeah
6289000	6290000	For sure
6290000	6291000	You want to get it out of your system
6291000	6292000	Yeah, yeah, it'll save us
6292000	6294000	Everybody with an Eli Roth DVD on their TV
6294000	6296000	Like they've got it all out of their system
6296000	6297000	Yeah
6297000	6299000	That's why violent crime went down so much
6299000	6300000	Yeah
6301000	6303000	I just sound like grandparents
6303000	6304000	But I guess
6304000	6306000	Grandparent Auto
6309000	6310000	Where's the God damn
6310000	6311000	I can't find the park
6311000	6312000	How does it
6312000	6314000	How do you make it shoot
6315000	6317000	Where's my grandchildren
6317000	6318000	But to answer your question
6318000	6320000	Where's my grandchildren
6320000	6321000	One of the backgrounds in Tilprest
6321000	6322000	Who am I
6322000	6323000	Get this
6323000	6324000	What
6324000	6326000	Get this strip club off of my lawn
6326000	6327000	Where's
6328000	6329000	Where's my
6329000	6330000	Where's my lawn
6330000	6332000	You can change the background to anything you want
6332000	6335000	So you can be standing in infinite space and painting shit
6335000	6336000	You go white room, a black room
6336000	6338000	You can have like a marble pedestal in front of you
6338000	6339000	If you want to make shit on top of that
6339000	6342000	You can make it any kind of room you want
6343000	6345000	You asked me a fucking question, man
6345000	6348000	And I'm in the middle of answering it for 10 minutes
6348000	6355000	And it's like the question is, Dan, tell us about your fucking sexually perverse brain
6355000	6357000	Like, and why you're a monster
6357000	6358000	And I'm trying to get there
6358000	6359000	I'm trying
6365000	6368000	One of the backgrounds that you can change it to is like a dress form
6368000	6369000	You know, what do you call it?
6369000	6370000	A maiden form
6372000	6373000	It's a torso
6373000	6376000	It's for pinning fabric to
6376000	6377000	I think it's called a maiden form
6377000	6379000	It's a maiden form, I think
6380000	6381000	A dress form
6382000	6383000	So it's
6383000	6384000	It's a dress form
6385000	6387000	So you're switching buttons like, oh, there's Saturn
6387000	6390000	And there's, I'm in the desert and I'm painting and stuff
6390000	6391000	And then it's like, oh, the dress form
6391000	6392000	And I was just like, ah
6393000	6396000	And it's a, it's fucking, it's a life-sized
6396000	6397000	Torso
6397000	6398000	A torso in front of you
6398000	6399000	No head
6399000	6400000	No head?
6400000	6401000	There's no head
6401000	6402000	Yes
6402000	6403000	Oh my God
6404000	6405000	No head
6405000	6406000	No limbs, no arms
6407000	6408000	A headless torso
6409000	6410000	So high
6410000	6412000	I feel like you guys are interpreting this the wrong way
6412000	6413000	But maybe not
6413000	6414000	I don't know
6414000	6415000	I mean, take me to jail
6415000	6416000	Oh my God
6416000	6418000	But what I'm trying to do is say, like, already it's like
6418000	6420000	Cody, run for the hills
6420000	6421000	The technology is so permanent
6421000	6423000	So it's like, you're in virtual reality
6423000	6425000	But there's a thing that is life-sized in front of you
6425000	6427000	That even thinly represents
6427000	6428000	That has no brain
6429000	6431000	So think about, like, Jessica Rabbit
6431000	6432000	And Who Framed Rabbit?
6432000	6434000	You think about, like, the ideal of beauty
6434000	6437000	Like, sometimes how it's, sometimes actually not only
6437000	6438000	It filters reality
6438000	6441000	But sometimes it seems like, like, it
6441000	6443000	The whole point is that it's not real
6443000	6445000	And it's like, there's gonna be this whole
6445000	6448000	I mean, you look at today, like, you have celebrities, sexuals
6448000	6451000	And, like, like, we're in this modern world
6451000	6454000	And, like, people are finding out all these different ways to be turned on
6454000	6457000	And, like, now we're going to have the first generation born into a world where
6457000	6458000	So, celebrities
6458000	6459000	What?
6459000	6462000	Yeah, people who just identify as, like, look, here's my sexuality
6463000	6466000	Like, well, I don't know, you'd have to talk to one of them
6466000	6469000	I don't want to mischaracterize it and say
6469000	6471000	Fame gives me a boner
6471000	6473000	That sounds, whatever
6473000	6475000	But it's like, I'm a celebrity, sexual
6475000	6477000	God, why am I fucking explaining myself to you?
6480000	6481000	Yes, it's a dress form
6481000	6482000	It couldn't be less
6482000	6485000	It's, like, the vague hint of femininity
6485000	6487000	In the vague hint of, like, a thing in front of you
6487000	6489000	And immediately, of course, I was just like
6490000	6493000	Just, like, kind of, like, you put your hands out there
6493000	6495000	Because that's your instinct
6495000	6498000	I always say you're because I'm trying to, like, decriminalize myself
6498000	6500000	But that's what I did
6500000	6502000	And it was like, oh, man, here we go
6502000	6506000	Like, this world, I'm glad I'm on the way out
6507000	6512000	I don't know if I'd be equipped to, like, handle the things that are ahead for kids
6512000	6516000	Like, how they're going to have to sort themselves out around this shit
6516000	6518000	Because you're going to be able to do anything you want
6518000	6520000	Like, like, like, like, all the time
6520000	6522000	And I think, also, the planet's going to be dying
6522000	6524000	So, like, like, like, like
6524000	6526000	So it's going to behoove us to, to
6526000	6528000	The more time we spend in this thing
6528000	6532000	The less time we're going to be driving our, our, our, our
6532000	6535000	Fog machines that are, like, destroying the earth
6535000	6536000	So it's going to
6536000	6537000	Dan
6537000	6539000	And when we put people in prison, which we love to do
6539000	6542000	We're going to be like, okay, you get to be in a virtual prison
6542000	6545000	So your cell can be smaller in real life
6546000	6547000	We're going to take advantage of it
6547000	6551000	Do you think that we're ready for fog machine car technology?
6552000	6554000	As long as there's signs in front of every freeway that says
6554000	6558000	When you say you put your hands out at this address form
6558000	6559000	You're, you're not
6559000	6562000	I'm a whole, you're holding, like, these wee paddles right now
6562000	6566000	They haven't done, like, you know, you're not minority reporting yet
6566000	6568000	With, like, fingerless gloves yet
6568000	6569000	But I'm sure that's coming
6569000	6573000	But it's actually more handy right now that they have, like, these very elaborate, like
6573000	6577000	Because that would just be two buttons, you know, on, off
6577000	6580000	This is, like, they still have these paddles
6580000	6581000	You're shaking your head
6581000	6583000	Well, okay, fine, alright, that's a different episode
6583000	6584000	Sorry, you didn't
6584000	6585000	No, it's fine, no
6585000	6589000	It's budget related, you know, I mean, they have options, but it's not accessible
6589000	6592000	And as soon as I get rid of the wires, right, right now it's, like, ridiculous
6592000	6596000	It's, like, you have, like, a big braid of, like, thick cables coming out of the top of your head
6596000	6598000	That, like, you have to, like, traipse around
6598000	6600000	It's, like, thank God I used to do stand-up
6600000	6602000	So I'm, like, not falling on my ass, like
6602000	6604000	I'm just, like, so what else is going on, ladies?
6604000	6606000	My applause
6607000	6611000	It's, it's, it's not there yet, but anyone that puts this thing on is gonna be, like, I get it
6611000	6615000	It's here, it's not going anywhere, and it's going, it's, like, it's the first time you
6615000	6618000	This is the Sugar Hill Gang, and, like
6619000	6623000	Like, there were people back then who were, like, no, what is all this dumb rapping thing?
6623000	6626000	And it's, like, you know, it's, it's, it's happening
6626000	6629000	It's the Sugar Hill Gang, everybody
6630000	6631000	Alright, so
6631000	6632000	The Sugar Hill Gang
6632000	6633000	We gotta end the show now
6633000	6634000	Yeah
6634000	6637000	We can, we can edit out the whole ending where I talk about VR
6638000	6641000	We can just end with the, the, uh, the, the
6641000	6643000	Robocop transgender metaphor
6643000	6644000	It was pretty good
