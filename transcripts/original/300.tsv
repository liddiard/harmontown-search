0	21280	What's up Dumbledore, Flimflammers, how you doing tonight?
21280	25800	As you can see we got a lot of chairs up here because we got a whole lot of show.
25800	43160	Are you excited for, number 300 everybody?
43160	47800	We should get everybody up on stage and do the Spencer dance.
47800	54720	All right, the Dynasty typewriter, the Hayworth and beautiful MacArthur Park Los Angeles.
54720	64920	The 300th harm in town is now in session.
64920	69920	Spencer Crittenden everybody.
69920	80960	What's up Spencer?
80960	81960	Why do we have bells?
81960	83480	Do we know about this?
83480	84480	The buzz in.
84480	85480	All right.
85480	88800	You got more candles, more candles.
88800	93000	I got subtle accessories.
93000	101400	Speaking of accessories, let's bring out the mayor of harm in town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
101400	117920	All right, let's bring it back from there.
117920	122800	We don't want to do that until like the end of the concert.
122800	127320	If anything, I mean isn't it ironic that I tried to telegraph to you for a teachable
127320	128320	moment.
128320	132440	It's an act of cowardice to kick over a chair that you've tripped over.
132440	136240	It would have been brave for me to say, I tripped over a chair.
136240	142840	That would have been the machismo move, but I did what a rock and roller sometimes does,
142840	145440	cornered by their own glory.
145440	149040	I was like, yeah, I hate chairs.
149040	152640	Oh boy.
152640	156280	I threw it on the ground.
156280	166040	Speaking of irony, paradoxes, is the plural of paradox, paradoxes, what is it, paradoxes?
166040	167040	Okay.
167040	174000	Welcome to the 300th episode of a thing that we never planned and we knew.
174000	176880	And you would be the only person that has been for all 300.
176880	178600	I would say that's probably inaccurate.
178600	179600	Yeah.
179600	181080	I never really thought about that.
181080	183280	I'm sure I missed 50 or so, I don't know.
183280	187600	Carson could not show up for a couple, but it wasn't called Carson Town.
187600	188600	You have no John Rivers.
188600	190600	But it was called The Late Show with Johnny Carson.
190600	196960	So and he did, but you know what, I can't either, maybe, I just can't fill these shoes.
196960	198280	Can't do it.
198280	200240	The subscribers would revolt.
200240	201240	Yeah.
201240	204880	We still have some?
204880	205880	Some shoes?
205880	206880	Subscribers.
206880	207880	Oh yeah.
207880	211080	Yeah, I'm sure we do.
211080	218680	I thank you for those of you who are newcomers, those of you who have been here with us and
218680	221520	followed us through all our venues.
221520	229280	I guess tonight's going to be a night of probably remembrance, unavoidably.
229280	232600	One of the weird ironies of the show is that we probably do a little too much recapping
232600	238000	anyway by accident because we're like middle-aged alcoholics that are casually repeating ourselves.
238000	239640	Let's do a clip show.
239640	241040	You guys did that last week.
241040	243440	Do you mean you'd retell that story about fucking...
243440	249080	We definitely complained about just listening to podcasts last week.
249080	253520	Like, Shrav made a big deal about that being a bad thing to do.
253520	254520	Right.
254520	257760	And we do actually, for his enjoyment, we have some clips of our own show tonight to
257760	258760	play for him.
258760	260760	He'll love it.
260760	265280	He probably won't disrupt it at all.
265280	267480	I didn't want to go overboard with the guests.
268480	271640	Like, let's get Doug Henning out here.
271640	277640	That was a magician, whatever.
277640	281720	I think probably on our 200th or our 100th, we probably had the same...
281720	289400	I'm always like, well, get us our progenitor, the person without whom I wouldn't have started
289400	295520	doing the podcast and we'll bring her and her husband kind of comes along with her wherever
295520	296520	she goes.
296520	297520	That's kind of a tag along.
297520	298800	We'll bring her out in a second.
298800	304720	But I first wanted to, before she comes out, I wanted to keep it classy and talk to you
304720	310440	about the fact that I'm shitting my brains out right now.
310440	311440	Right now?
311440	314800	Well, something is happening to me.
314800	315800	Classy?
315800	316800	Something beautiful.
316800	325400	I think I might be dying only because I'm experiencing, for the first time in my life,
325760	330680	pure diarrhea without any other symptoms.
330680	335480	So it's like, your ass is just a faucet.
335480	338240	I don't have a fever.
338240	341440	I don't have a tummy ache even.
341440	348360	I'll eat a cracker and my body will go, you want to turn that into four ounces of water?
348360	350520	And then the irony is I drink anything.
350520	352000	I'm even testing the theory.
352000	353000	I can drink anything.
353000	355480	I'm drinking a Coors Light right now.
355480	357280	It doesn't do anything with that.
357280	361960	But there's pizza backstage and I was like, I can't nibble that or my body will go into
361960	363480	this juicer mode.
363480	365560	I have no idea what's happening.
365560	373120	It's been happening all weekend and then it was, I'm surviving on Imodium and what's
373120	374120	that?
374120	375120	You know what it means?
375120	376120	You're in love.
376120	386520	That's more plausible than Dave Klein's theory, which is that my body is shitting out all
386520	387520	its fat.
387520	397520	And I'm like, Dave, okay, if it's possible to do that, why, I don't gazelle do that while
397520	399000	they're running from a tiger.
399000	402880	I adore Dave Klein, he's sitting right near me.
402880	407600	I think last week we proved that he has no actual qualification as a trainer.
407600	415400	A bunch of drug addicts came on stage and you were the most fit person on the whole.
415400	417560	Well, that sounds like a qualification right there.
417560	421360	He's getting the job done and I would never work with whatever you think in your head
421360	422680	is a legitimate trainer.
422680	423680	Fuck that guy.
423680	424680	I wouldn't work with him.
424680	430880	So like I'm working with the only guy that I would ever be this long into working out
430880	435000	and still show up every time.
435000	441560	I would have bailed so long ago on any kind of, I don't want to say real because it makes
441560	444480	you sound unreal.
444480	450840	Although sometimes I believe that I'm the only one that can see you, but there's absolutely
450840	451840	no way.
451840	459520	There's no way I would ever do the fucking trainer that's supposedly the real thing.
459520	460960	I had to go with Dave Klein.
460960	461960	All right.
461960	466320	Anyways, and I'm going to live like five years longer at least because of it, unless I shit
466320	467320	out my soul tonight.
467320	470880	I don't know if I did I run over a gypsy baby.
470880	471880	Yeah.
471880	472880	You don't remember that?
472880	473880	Oh, don't do that.
473880	474880	Don't do that.
474880	476960	That'll give you the diarrhea right away.
476960	477960	Yeah.
477960	482440	It's just, I think Spencer and I, our theory is just so you don't panic at home tonight.
482440	487360	My theory is his butt thinks it's his dick.
487360	489640	He keeps peeing out his butt.
489640	490920	Sorry.
490920	492720	What was our theory?
492720	494200	You've made up that theory.
494200	497960	You're trying to appeal to a demographic.
497960	502520	Which demographic would that be?
502520	506600	Our theory was that because I've been eating on these protein bars, like I get these, oh
506600	511120	yeah, I just like these peanut butter protein bars and I think there's like, there's so
511120	518440	my body has taken in so much like fake alcohol based sugar, like substitute that it finally
518440	522120	got to a tipping point where our body's like, so we live on the moon now.
522120	525200	Like, like, like, so you're just going to shit in a funnel, right?
525200	528000	Like, like, maybe I'll help you propel.
528000	532040	Like, like, like, I think, I think, I think your body, like if you starve it, your body
532040	535960	goes into ketosis, if you, you know, your body reacts to certain things it's taking
535960	539400	in your body goes, okay, so we're obviously being hunted right now.
539400	541160	So here's how I'll react.
541160	542160	Right.
542160	546680	And but when you're on the moon, if you, I think if you eat enough of this like synthetic
546680	550920	like protein bar, your body eventually goes, so we're moonrakers, like, like, let's just
550920	551920	poop liquid.
551920	552920	I don't know.
552920	558080	I thought you guys would enjoy that theory, but like, but I don't want to, you know, like
558080	562400	part of our 300th episode is going to be a recalibration of our social contract.
562400	567120	I'm sorry if sometimes I let you know after you don't react to something that you should
567120	568120	have reacted to it.
568120	570000	I never mean to do that to you.
570000	575360	You know, Tolstoy, towards the end of his life, he, he kept a diary.
575360	578200	And towards the end of his life, a lot of his entry is just about pooping.
578200	579200	All right.
579200	580200	So you're turning into Tolstoy.
580200	582640	So you're in good literary company, though.
582640	583640	Right.
583640	586320	I'm not going to connect the dots between diary and diarrhea.
586320	589080	I'm not going to do it because I'm like a craftsman.
589080	592120	Like I don't, I don't just connect whatever dots there.
592120	594120	Yeah, that would be dumb.
594120	595120	Yeah.
595840	600520	I don't think there's anything else before we start bringing out friends and just looking
600520	601520	back.
601520	605840	Oh, here's a boy.
605840	612040	If you didn't like the last thing I thought you'd laugh at, you'll love not laughing
612040	615000	at this.
615000	618640	Here we go.
618640	624960	The ultimate paradox, I thought, as I was getting dressed this morning, the more slimming
624960	628640	your shirt color, the more dandruff enhancing.
628640	632480	This is like driving to work.
632480	634600	I'm like, Jesus, fucking dog hair and dandruff.
634600	637360	I'm like, why did you, why do you, why do you have so many black shirts?
637360	639880	Oh, because you don't want to look like you're fat.
639880	645480	You're trying to like be like the venom suit and like you, you, you, you've fallen for
645480	650320	that theory that if there's no color, you could like the people won't see your body.
650320	651320	You'll be a shadow.
651320	652320	Is it me?
652800	653800	Is it me?
653800	655920	I like, I like what's going on with your hair and your beard right now.
655920	657560	I like, I like, I like the whole design right now.
657560	661160	I put a little shampoo this morning and I, so you got to give it a couple of days to
661160	662160	oil back down.
662160	666280	But, but you, but you, but you, you crossed over recently into being almost completely
666280	667280	gray haired.
667280	672000	Like the use, like that happened pretty fast for me or maybe I just haven't seen you that
672000	673000	much.
673000	674000	Yeah.
674000	675000	I like it.
675000	676000	You look great.
676000	677000	That's great.
677000	679000	You look like the, like you look like one of the captains of like the deadliest catch.
680000	681000	Yeah.
681000	694640	Uh, the deadliest catch of all life, uh, so you, you, you know, that crab trap comes up.
694640	697920	Oh, it's full of death.
697920	703120	It's full of, it's full of sands of time, 300 miles off the Bering sea.
703120	706400	I can't remember what the fuck it, uh, all right.
706400	708000	And it's actually sponsored by Coors Light.
708000	712240	So you're fricking right in it right now, you're going to roll into our other unofficial
712240	713240	sponsor.
713240	715240	Some of our illustrious alumnus.
715240	716240	Yeah.
716240	722840	Uh, yeah, honestly for real, like, like I, I've never, I never would have, uh, the podcast
722840	723840	thing.
723840	724840	I never would have done it.
724840	728640	She said one night at the roost, uh, you should do a podcast and then I kind of resisted it
728640	734320	for awhile and did a show at nerd melt and, uh, and then, uh, started doing it and, um,
734320	743320	and she's also the reason why your favorite person in the world that you miss so much
743320	749880	all the time is, uh, what used to be on the show before he became so valuable to you that
749880	755000	he had to go away and serve you from a different tier of reality.
755000	761360	Uh, let's, let's, what, what, what a charming intro.
761360	768800	I just want the audience to know we're, I don't hate him.
768800	770560	I hate the audience for loving him.
770560	771560	Oh, okay.
771560	772560	So you, okay.
772560	774960	So you, instead of hating one person, now you hate a hundred people.
774960	779640	We all know if you watch the show or if you've ever been to the Reddit, the, the, the, the
779640	786280	dog whistle for I hate harm in town is I miss Kumail like, let's bring out command on Johnny
786280	787280	and Emily Gordon, everybody.
787280	788280	Hello everybody.
788280	789280	Hi.
789280	790280	Hi.
790280	791280	Hi.
791280	792280	Kumail, did you hear that Dan hates you?
792280	793280	Yeah.
793280	794280	Yeah.
794280	795280	Yeah.
795280	796280	Yeah.
796280	797280	Yeah.
797280	798280	Yeah.
798280	799280	Yeah.
799280	800280	Yeah.
800280	801280	Yeah.
801280	802280	Yeah.
802280	803280	Yeah.
803280	804280	Yeah.
804280	805280	Yeah.
805280	806280	Yeah.
806280	807280	Yeah.
807280	808280	Yeah.
808280	809280	Yeah.
809280	810280	Yeah.
810280	811280	Yeah.
811280	812280	Yeah.
812280	813280	Yeah.
813280	814280	Yeah.
815280	816480	Kumail, did you hear that Dan hates you?
816480	817480	Yeah.
817480	818480	No, I heard.
818480	819480	He knew.
819480	820480	I think he resents you.
820480	821480	It's different.
821480	823080	He resents is a compliment.
823080	827440	Hates you is like, fuck this guy resents is like Lucifer and talking about God.
827440	828440	Wow.
828440	829440	Wow.
829440	830640	That's crazy.
830640	831640	You really?
831640	833040	That's like the highest form of flattery.
833040	834520	I resent him.
834520	835840	Uh, why?
835840	838360	Oh, the audience misses him.
838360	840960	That's, that's a fucking, come on.
840960	841960	That's good.
841960	842960	No, I'm in, I'm into it.
842960	844200	He does like it quite a bit.
844720	846440	I'm changing microphones.
846440	850840	That one has a dent in it and I feel like I'm better than that now.
850840	852280	Old Kumail would have kept that microphone.
852280	854920	I'm not going to have a fucking dented microphone.
854920	855920	I'm God.
855920	856920	Look at mine.
856920	857920	Yeah.
857920	858920	Well, good luck with that.
858920	859920	Like a cone head.
859920	863200	Do either of you guys like, uh, back on the rocks?
863200	864200	I'm gonna kill.
864200	865200	All microphones are like cone heads.
865200	866200	What do you, what do you mean?
866200	867200	They look like ice cream cones.
867200	872200	A point, like a freak show cone head, old school freak show, um, pin head.
872200	876680	We've really gotten into unrelatable comedy now where we just talk about the lumpiness
876680	878480	of the microphones we're talking into.
878480	882840	Well, don't do relatable because I tried to, I was trying to make them laugh by doing the
882840	887600	meme of like, I miss Kumail and it just, I guess people like think that these guys are
887600	888600	on the Reddit.
888600	889600	Yeah.
889600	891200	I guess maybe they were.
891200	892440	I used to be on the Reddit.
892440	896240	Oh, no, don't be that Emily, are you proud or are you ashamed of what you've created
896240	897240	over 300 episodes?
897240	898240	Both.
898240	899240	It's both an option.
899240	900240	Always.
900280	902240	I mean, what a crazy thing.
902240	903240	Happy 300 episodes.
903240	904240	Thank you.
904240	905240	Thank you.
905240	906240	What an amazing thing.
906240	917680	And the show you started out doing was we're all going to go to the moon, right?
917680	919200	How will we survive there?
919200	920200	Right.
920200	921760	And every week explored that topic.
921760	922760	Right.
922760	923760	That was the original conceit.
923760	924760	Right.
924760	925760	For the first couple of episodes.
925760	927760	It's just nice to go back and look at like, that's where we started.
927760	928760	Right.
928760	929760	Yeah.
930280	935880	And now it's 300 episodes later and Trump is going to the moon.
935880	936880	Space Force.
936880	939000	Space Force.
939000	942280	And I want to dig a hole and hide and die.
942280	944000	Which that is easier than going to the moon.
944000	945000	Yeah.
945000	946000	Yeah.
946000	950400	I like, I listen, I don't want to be the odd one out, but I, I like Spencer's theory
950400	953360	that your butt has become a dick.
953360	954720	It just thinks it's a dick.
954720	955720	And it thinks it's a dick.
955720	956720	Are you pooping out of your penis?
956720	959640	Because then we can be sure that he happened.
959640	963000	That sounds oddly like satisfying.
963000	964000	I know.
964000	965240	I'm genuinely sad.
965240	967160	I'll never poop out my penis.
967160	969080	Well, because I never know what that feels like.
969080	974880	Aren't you picturing like a, like, like, um, um, what's it the, um, the soft serve, the
974880	979680	Carmex or what's the thing that like the, the Carmex, the lip, the lip balm, like it's
979680	985720	got the little tiny hole and then it has like that really satisfying, narrow, like, like
985720	990240	worm that comes out, like it's like really consistent and like, you can like write with
990240	995160	it if you were a chef, like, I just, I mean, obviously you wouldn't need to wipe, you just
995160	999720	got a Q-tip and you're good to go.
999720	1000720	Carmex.
1000720	1005000	Would you have to squat for that or you think you could do it standing?
1005000	1006800	Oh, you could do it standing.
1006800	1010560	These are questions I can't answer.
1010560	1015960	Speaking of Dan, Dan Poopens, uh, there's something that you said, like sometimes things
1015960	1016960	stick with you.
1016960	1020520	Like when I'm shaving, I remember comments about shaving because it's a kind of a quiet
1020520	1021760	moment or I'm washing my hair.
1021760	1027240	I'll remember a line or a joke about washing air, but you have haunted me with the thing
1027240	1031400	that you said that you can never wipe enough.
1031400	1036960	Like it's never done because you said my, my, my butt is like an endless can of shoe
1036960	1041800	polish.
1041800	1047120	That has stuck with me and it will stay with me until I have Alzheimer's.
1047120	1050760	Well then someone sent me that meme that was like I got from Parks and Rec, like Chris
1050760	1053920	Pratt did the thing where he's like, it's like, it's like wiping a magic marker.
1053920	1057160	And I felt so, so much, seen, you felt seen.
1057160	1058160	Yes.
1058160	1061240	Like, thank you.
1061240	1063000	And he, and he was like, thank you.
1063000	1064000	You stole that.
1064000	1066440	And I was like, no, you probably still, I don't, who knows who stole what?
1066440	1070840	I mean, when I wipe my ass, it never stops.
1070840	1073960	Great minds think alike.
1073960	1077080	Great asses wipe alike.
1077080	1082120	Speaking of great minds, we've had some wonderful ones on this show.
1082120	1083880	I thought that's what Jeff was doing.
1083880	1088720	I thought he was setting up a clip and, you know, we could, we have a bunch of clips right
1088720	1091000	now that we can play up on the screen and you'll be able to hear them.
1091000	1095920	If you're an audio listener, uh, as opposed to a video listener.
1096640	1097640	Haha.
1097640	1099640	Burn.
1099640	1100640	Yeah.
1100640	1102880	Let's just test it.
1102880	1107760	I just want to test, see how it goes, computers on and the sound down for this next one.
1107760	1114880	Uh, here's a, here's a little clip, uh, uh, of our friend, uh, of the podcast, Rob shrub
1114880	1119000	wondering, uh, about space exploration.
1119000	1120840	Why don't we ever go down?
1120840	1125840	That's not shrub celebrating 300 episodes.
1125840	1137920	And that was that clip, that was why don't we go down?
1137920	1141240	That's weird because watch their mouths moving.
1141240	1143560	That clip was longer than I remember it.
1143560	1144560	Yeah.
1144560	1145560	All right.
1145560	1153040	Well, we've, we've, we've, here's something I've always wanted to know how come when we,
1153680	1157160	when we go into space, how come we've never gone down?
1157160	1162160	We're always going to the moon.
1162160	1164960	I was going there.
1164960	1170600	I always send and step out past my, how come we don't go down into the earth?
1170600	1171600	Somebody what?
1171600	1172600	Into the center of the earth.
1172600	1173600	No, no, no.
1173600	1174600	No, he's gone.
1174600	1175600	How come we're always on this two-dimensional plane?
1175600	1176600	Go to Mars.
1176600	1177600	The planets.
1178440	1179440	The planets.
1179440	1182360	Why don't we go down?
1182360	1186160	We never go down.
1186160	1187160	Yeah.
1187160	1190280	We always go.
1190280	1191680	Why do we always go?
1191680	1192680	Why do we always go?
1192680	1193680	We're going to go.
1193680	1198800	We're going to go to the moon and do we go to Mars and then maybe we'll go this way right
1198800	1199800	under us.
1199800	1200800	We could,
1200800	1202920	a whole other solar system right under us.
1202920	1203920	We never,
1203920	1205400	what am I going to apartment complex?
1205400	1207420	Don't be a son under this.
1207420	1213380	sun even in such an it is like everybody you see some a rocket takes off it just
1213380	1219660	goes left it doesn't go we never go down you know and I think is it why the South
1219660	1224520	Pole needs a like like a rocket they teach you when you when you're making
1224520	1228420	this like those little like mobiles of the solar system is just a flat thing
1228420	1234960	yeah why don't they ever go down because then then you'd hit a baby with them
1234960	1243040	that's it cuz it's based on a mobile mobile oh shit we're I say hey let's
1243040	1247000	bring out Rob Schwab everybody Rob Schwab

1293960	1297880	by the way in case we play any more clips I did not want to create the false

1302880	1308520	out like that's not true at all we are absolutely tapped that's it that's the
1308520	1313080	end of that we did not reach out with like no one's coming that's not we're

1449400	1457280	shops doing it I dropped my phone maybe the chair is not a great idea yeah this
1457280	1461800	is also a man who takes his shirt off when he goes to the bathroom in a large
1461800	1467560	way do you take your pants off sometimes I take my pants off I leave my pants on
1467560	1472440	and shit into them shirtless oh well that's why you change your underwear
1472440	1478780	before you go to bed that's right because by then I've already peed in it
1478780	1488280	multiple times and if I'm lucky pooped in it twice or thrice oh shit Jeff just
1488280	1499160	pulled rank so did shrub Emily did you just announced that Kumail Nanjiani

1554060	1559300	other do you do you has and I'm sorry to do this but this is a question that
1559300	1567180	affects me hey do you get mad if Camille forgets the flesh like I don't
1567180	1572740	forget okay okay how can you forget I thought it was there's something in
1572740	1578860	there this is a guy that changes outfits to go poo he's not gonna forget the
1578860	1584940	no no yeah okay he goes to Narnia to poop all right oh what did I forget okay
1584940	1592940	okay all right everybody just settle the fuck down all right so and I've discussed
1592940	1598060	this on the show before the last five years I've been getting forgetting to
1598060	1604220	flush the toilet oh it just started the last five years it just started I blame
1604220	1611660	Wi-Fi I think there's something in the air that is affecting my brain also like
1611660	1619140	the bees were getting lost yeah I read a science paper it said that bees are
1619140	1622260	getting lost and then some people are forgetting to flush I think that Wi-Fi
1622260	1626580	kills ghosts I think that's why we don't see ghosts anymore I think you're
1626580	1630040	right because there were ghosts and then they got pulverized by all this
1630040	1634300	electromagnetic radiation without a bodies to protect themselves you were
1634300	1638820	saying there were ghosts until the late 90s yeah absolutely there were you saw
1638820	1645100	no I just know you know why I think there's ghosts why because it's it is
1645100	1650180	because of Wi-Fi but here's why hi ghosts ghosts can only walk around and
1650180	1653660	they can't touch anything but think about it we're all on our phones and
1653660	1658260	iPads now so ghosts are like set they're like oh I'm just gonna watch ABC News
1658260	1662580	with this guy oh like they're ghosts are like they don't have to be poltergeists
1662580	1665460	they're like what's this tea kettle doing here this isn't my wife's tea
1665460	1673100	kettle they're they're like Jesus Christ that's a great tweet yeah what do we
1673100	1677540	know about ghosts they love petty yeah they get hooked in by petty shit
1677780	1682740	go to fucking heaven when you die there's a gateway that goes like rise
1682740	1687460	above it and they're like no I'll do the Twitter of fucking supernatural activity
1687460	1691140	which is hang out here and fucking monitor everything otherwise I might
1691140	1694660	miss something who's living in my apartment and then and then for everybody
1694660	1698380	to be like hey look it's my dick and balls and the ghost is like fuck yeah
1698380	1703460	okay that's a pretty good theory that's not a bad theory so you're saying they're
1703460	1708380	still around they're just happy they're happy they're more like us now they're
1708380	1712340	not like who is this living in my house they're like oh it's one of me oh yeah
1712340	1718900	it's another floating yeah non-person just like drifting through the fucking
1718900	1723180	earth like not knowing where to go so I have a question is it possible that you
1723180	1729100	just flushed it and it's not enough great question great that that that's
1729220	1734780	sorry sorry I wanted to go back to a very good question so lately in order
1734780	1740780	I've been trying really hard to flush to flush so hard it's been it's a lot like
1740780	1746660	a dream of getting in the way forgetting forgetting forgetting is getting in the
1746660	1752260	way and and but it's like I have so much anxiety to the point that I'll be like
1752260	1756980	like this morning I'll be driving to work and then I'll stop at a stop sign
1756980	1762060	I went oh shit and I'll text Kate going hey just in case flush the toilet
1762060	1769140	before you open open the lid or you close the lid there's your fucking
1769140	1771580	problem
1771580	1776340	keep the lid open and you'll be brush particles get on your toothbrush oh yeah
1776340	1780980	good call good but the dude stays in the toilet oh so other way that's a great
1780980	1786700	reason of you're you're remembering yes you're remembering poop particles
1786700	1791660	enough to close it in like a fucking mug why are you gonna get a window
1791660	1797140	installed in the lid of the toilet oh that could be good oh yeah there you go
1797140	1802260	that's it do those fancy glass top toilet hi yeah like a fat glass top
1802260	1805660	toilet or you can remember to flush like every other fucking human being in the
1805660	1809380	world you know what you think you know I bet you there's a lot of people out
1809380	1814540	there that forget to flush and I it's your anxiety about it is now the big
1815300	1821060	deal because because I'll at the stoplight I'll text and I'll go and it
1821060	1825980	and there's not even an ellipses of like too late
1827980	1836540	that was the prices right people forget like oh did I leave the oven on or
1836540	1843100	whatever you're like yeah except I just yeah that happens to me where I think
1843100	1846820	I've left a straightening iron on but all every time we leave the house okay
1846820	1850540	that's true but I'd never leave it on but you actually are leaving poop in
1850540	1855940	that toilet maybe an auto flusher like I air airport that could be but Rob also
1855940	1859660	you have one of the most exotic toilets I've ever seen yes a great toilet one of
1859660	1862740	those Japanese things that talks to you I've got like a little water fountain
1862740	1866660	dances I need an upgrade I need to upgrade yeah you hear here I have an
1866660	1870340	idea upgrade no don't upgrade no here's an idea
1870460	1873980	you're saying Wi-Fi so you're on your phone and that's the problem right you
1873980	1877060	know about how long it's taking you to poop five minutes ten minutes what is it
1877060	1882620	what is it when you have to pool before you start set an alarm and then go whoo
1882620	1886220	and then when the alarm goes off remember to do that he can't remember to
1886220	1890940	flip he's remember to poop I bet when you have to go poop at that moment you're
1890940	1896220	like I have a flush afterwards and then you forget in the interim right yes I'm
1896220	1900660	just glad I got an alarm I've been feeling bad because as I think your
1900660	1904620	brain just degenerates and there's like pixels that get removed from the JPEG
1904620	1909260	you know for me it's I keep forgetting Jeff Bridges name and like like stuff
1909260	1912620	like that like I'm like who the fuck was that wait it's like just random people
1912620	1918420	that you should like I'll spend I'll be going it's not like and everyone's just
1918420	1923060	waiting for me and I'm like yeah no and I don't I know that all I have to say is
1923060	1928380	the bad guy from seven but I won't say it cuz that'll be weakness like I like
1928380	1932820	cuz then they'll go Kevin Spacey I'm like I'm not old like like so I'll just
1932820	1937340	sit there I forgot the name of the bad guy from seven everyone has to wait
1937340	1943820	until I forge my neural pathway back but I'd rather I'd rather forget
1943820	1948420	celebrities names and forget that my I don't know his only has one victim this
1948420	1953020	is really really I mean I thought I'd share something with you that you know
1953020	1959500	I mean with with the audience but I mean like my real question is does Kate
1959500	1967740	have a right to be mad at me yeah yeah only because you're a grown-up okay well
1967740	1972420	new problem well she has a right to be mad but it's gonna do about as much good
1972420	1977140	as being mad at the weather all right well no here's the issue is Emily
1977140	1980140	brought up something that's interesting if this was the thing from the very
1980140	1983500	beginning when you guys met she's like this guy's great I think I'm very fine
1983500	1987180	for him he never flushes right he could get past that then she should be then
1987180	1990220	that's part of the equation but now she's with you and you spring this honor
1990220	1993700	many years into the relationship you can't even do that you knew I was like
1993700	1997380	this when you met me you can't even do that you can say you changed you used to
1997380	2001620	flush but we're all changing we're all dying and ideally we're dying together
2001620	2004340	and partner
2005340	2011980	there is carbon-based life forms we're melting but you can't make fun of that
2011980	2024500	yeah you can watch we've been doing it for a while great for a while he walked
2024500	2030060	around with a little box of Captain Crunch yeah that was a bathrobe thing
2030060	2035180	and I don't like we've established that Rob doesn't flush Dan is pooping his
2035180	2040060	pants currently Kumail takes his shirt off like a fucking lunatic I take my
2040060	2045180	stuff everyone does it which is thank you for validating back to that I was
2045180	2049260	done to find out everyone doesn't do it it's just it's just it's because it's
2049260	2052860	like for me it's like like I've never done it but I always think about it when
2052860	2055380	it's too late when I'm sitting down I'm like damn I should have taken my shirt
2055380	2058520	up so I love the idea of you're watching forensic files and you're like I love
2058520	2065080	you I love you too and then and then Kumail's like like a couple of
2065080	2072600	minutes later he's like he stands up he pauses forensic files he takes his shirt
2072600	2078040	off like a Mountain Dew commercial and Emily just knows he just walks off it's
2078040	2081480	like I guess it's I guess it's gonna be three minutes yeah and I did find out
2081480	2086480	because he would walk back into the room putting on his shirt I love that he's
2086480	2090160	like John Henry he's like I'm gonna go beat a steam engine I don't want to
2090160	2095320	bring any any of that battle back with me true because I'm a human being I'm
2095320	2099440	civilized but when I'm sitting on the toilet I'm a fucking animal I'm gonna go
2099440	2104000	slay a dragon and I when I come back I'm still gonna be a white knight like blood
2104000	2108680	all over you do that in public I don't poop in public well no but like at work
2108680	2115360	and stuff sure you you pooped at work right oh no I if if it's a trailer yeah
2115360	2118760	yeah I take everything off you take everything off in your trailer at work
2118760	2125840	yeah you strip down you take off your socks like you're a clone like you're a
2125840	2129840	clone a Logan's run clone or something like here yeah Logan's run isn't like
2129840	2134520	you get totally nude even if you're in it on a shoot in a trailer yeah you get
2134520	2139840	down to the fucking nitty-gritty what about an airplane now great question I've
2139840	2145200	never pooped in an airplane yeah it's great no it's not good what theoretically
2145200	2149560	you've taken some very long flights you never had this although I do go into a
2149560	2153720	plane and the first thing I do is I go and change my underwear in the airplane
2153720	2159680	back I go and check that's a good this is why you're so fucked like this is all
2159680	2165300	genius level move this is all amazing shit you must like you have the best you
2165300	2171240	must love it every day of your life this is all optimized it's all good he
2171240	2175360	doesn't have a fucking sweaty underwear going to bed what do you do with the
2175360	2180640	dirty underwear what do you do with this dirty underwear so now you I donate it
2180640	2188600	to the orphans no I what day is it my boy
2188600	2205560	it's Christmas with this with Delta miles I've only worn it for four hours
2205560	2210800	also doesn't sleep in underwear wears specific I don't I cannot sleep in
2210800	2213800	underwear so if I'm on a plane and I have to take a nap I'm going into the
2213800	2217880	bathroom taking off my underwear not putting on another underwear coming back
2217880	2221320	and sitting in my seat to take a nap then when before it's time to land I'm
2221320	2224600	going into the bathroom I'm putting on underwear because now I'm ready for the
2224600	2231380	day like I have a hidden superpower because I feel like well you have a
2231380	2237680	superpower which is like super sensitivity to your underwear being used
2237680	2242080	I hate I have the opposite I'm like juggernaut and you're like that that the
2242080	2246000	girl with the has to wear the gloves and the X-Men are there otherwise she'll
2246000	2251360	kill people that's right we're both powerful but like I'm like it's been six
2251360	2259760	days I should change my underwear because I read an article about someone
2259760	2265640	just remind I saw a zeppelin in the sky that was a certain I don't know I hate
2265640	2269720	I've always hated underwear I probably didn't start wearing underwear till I
2269720	2274720	was probably about 14 I delayed it as long as I could I probably have 50 pairs
2274720	2278160	of underwear that are currently in rotation well and this is a good
2278160	2282080	question I think for the board what is the oldest pair of underwear you own
2282080	2288480	oh cuz it's a decent thing to think about Nathan I don't know I don't know
2288480	2293280	you do you name your underwear not name it but like no no the longest like the
2293280	2298680	oldest pair she didn't say name them she said I don't know they're all kind of
2298680	2306040	they look the same to me well that's so racist we're lucky in it while we think
2306040	2310840	about it should we bring up Brandon Johnson and find out what his underwear
2328680	2341080	my pants okay hey how I like what's your what's your what's your problem
2341080	2355320	buddy night pants I'm just I love this idea of such elegance of changing your
2355320	2359600	underwear throughout the day like that yeah right so you agree with the rest of
2359600	2364200	us in the middle of the belt curve that he's like Downton Abbey style why is it
2364200	2371120	not good I will tell you it's just a lot of it's a lot of laundry to man doesn't
2371120	2375720	matter you're worth it yeah goddamn you're worth it it's on some Rick Ross
2375720	2380920	shit for real yeah I just it is some rapper baller type like I only wear this
2380920	2388960	white t-shirt and I throw that shit away you know I did some math for the
2388960	2392840	price that most people spend on like coffee weekly you could definitely have
2392840	2397000	brand-new socks every day of the week that sounds like a horrible infomercial
2397000	2403400	and that's why I've come up with sock a day are you telling me all I have to do
2403400	2407200	is fill out paperwork and socks will come to my house I'm telling you I'll
2407200	2413000	fill out half of it oh I will never be alone again you will never be alone
2413000	2432280	again well what have we learned over 300 episodes that it's okay if I forget to
2432280	2439280	fly no no that's not been the takeaway but the texting and saying honey I'm
2439280	2446000	sorry I don't remember how often when you're texting or how often is it what
2446000	2449560	percentage of the time have you not flushed and what percentage have you
2449560	2455160	flushed and you're almost a hundred yeah it's all almost a hundred almost a
2455160	2459800	hundred so what if you take like a golden string right you tie it to the to
2459800	2464040	the flusher and you will put a loop on the other end when you sit down on the
2464040	2468360	toilet you put the looped end if you remember if he could remember to put a
2468360	2472160	string on his finger he could remember to remove poop if you see a golden
2472160	2476040	string on your toilet you will remember to put a string on your thing right
2476040	2480120	let's string on your let's not shoot let's not shoot from the makers of
2480120	2484680	socket is let's yes string on your thing string anything's good you could also
2484680	2488680	say it as you do it that helps me when I like I'm unplugging stuff I go I have
2488680	2493280	unplugged the flat iron you're like me oh yeah now that's a good idea I think
2493280	2498840	I so that's a good that's a helpful thing to say a rope coming down from a
2498840	2504560	really well anchored thing in your soles when it's it's a like you shape it
2504560	2508600	into a thing that slips over your neck like right so it's hanging you're not
2508600	2512400	gonna forget you it's gonna be in your way the way to get it out of your way is
2512400	2517120	you slip it over your neck you take a poop yeah you get up if you you could
2517120	2523360	forget everything you could forget to wipe you start walking away oh I forgot
2523360	2527320	oh what am I oh what was I I must have been so preoccupied with the events of
2527320	2532560	the day oh look at this there's a toilet full of shit here I'm naked my wedding
2532560	2538080	rings gone how can you not write as you get up from the toilet go for the flush
2538080	2540840	is that not part of muscle memory here's what I've learned here's where I'm
2540840	2544080	gonna take away from this conversation as you're putting your shirt back on
2544080	2549080	just flush the toilet from now on I'm gonna get totally nude every time I
2549080	2552200	poop no matter where I am it's freeing you're gonna love it but I'm also gonna
2552200	2559160	stop flushing Emily what's your what's your weird poop stories ladies don't
2559160	2565800	have those um I did okay I did dumping a ziploc bag once when we lived in
2565800	2574680	Brooklyn yeah whoa that's legit that's some Iceland shit hurricane sandy what
2574680	2584440	happened or weirdest charity event ever probably like New Year's Eve that's why
2584440	2590880	that $75 came from I didn't know I'd be Oscar-nominated one day I thought it was
2590880	2600480	the top of my game I ever spent was this a deleted scene from the big sick
2602480	2606160	no I don't our toilet was just out and they were like we're not getting to you
2606160	2608920	for days and we lived in a dangerous neighborhood and it was late at night
2608920	2612800	and I couldn't leave so I thought ziploc bag
2612800	2618000	what size like the court size like this I'm talking gallon sandwich size or the
2618000	2631360	big daddy little coke bag I did a dime bag she did a dime bag of shit a little
2631360	2637240	logo on him from her cartel the cops are like who's the scorpion person her poop
2637240	2642680	actually has a blue hue to it yeah did you make sure the the air was all out of
2642680	2648160	it before you close it I did a pretty good why are you trying to keep it fresh
2648160	2654360	no but I did the instinct was there why oh just get all the air out why because
2654360	2658760	I didn't want it to pop that's fair right well you're not like blowing into
2658760	2663840	it are you sure you take your shirt off let me have my thing wait did you did
2663840	2669160	you save it until you found a toilet to flush it no here's what I did I put the
2669160	2676400	bag woke me up I double bagged it three times I do another bag and then only
2676400	2680840	know the word that met twice but three times you are so high and mighty for a
2680840	2687120	man who has to get naked to shit that's the yeah of what you did I am clean the
2687120	2691680	clothes are far away from the shit you're sitting into a bag
2694080	2697760	and then I went down to our dumpster which is behind the building and got
2697760	2700720	rid of the evidence you were living together oh yeah we were married so
2700720	2705080	during during this period where the toilet was at what on earth was Kumeil
2705080	2709920	pooping in oh I think you were at work or something you weren't there he just
2709920	2715240	bought a first-class ticket on United jeez yeah do his biz yeah you weren't
2715240	2719200	there for whatever reason you were not home and it was just not the kind of
2719200	2722800	neighborhood you could like walk to the closest as a guy who listens to too many
2722800	2727600	true crime podcasts with Cody like I if I get a text if I ever got a text from
2727600	2734840	Cody that said had to take a shit waters out shit in a bag actually shit on the
2734840	2741320	floor like instead of leaving the house ever I'd be like good good yeah I don't
2741320	2745040	think that's healthy but I know that would be right good good yeah next time
2745040	2749320	don't leave the bedroom yeah no it was a bad neighborhood it was pretty common if
2749320	2753000	you open the dumpster it was full of bags of shit just bags and bags of shit
2753000	2756720	everybody was doing that over there so somehow it's okay to leave the house and
2756720	2759600	go behind the building the building you remember the back door was like that
2759600	2766800	enclosed yeah dumpster space I know what I was doing yeah no way I have more
2766800	2770440	questions I thought of more questions but you wiped I assume of course and
2770440	2774680	where did the toilet it went in the back with it yeah yeah I got rid of all the
2774680	2780560	evidence so you would wipe and put it into the bag yeah of shit or a separate
2780560	2785160	bag same bag so it was just one bag with the poop someone who found that was like
2785160	2791400	oh I know what happened here this is act one and two and three you ever see like
2791400	2794200	a public toilet or like a workplace toilet where there's like a
2794200	2797680	conversation going on because there's something going wrong with the toilet or
2797680	2802480	so somebody will put up a sign they put all the effort into an aerial true type
2802480	2807040	font a piece of typing paper above the thing it says like but they just it's
2807040	2812360	like don't flush tampons it was they would that they would be that specific
2812360	2815840	because you'd know exactly what not to flush but I'm saying like when they get
2815840	2821760	amorphous and they're like don't flush non waste or something like that and
2821760	2825560	then there's like so then people get ball pipelines ago you you so you mean
2825560	2830000	like toilet paper like everyone turns into a reddit forum like like that it's
2830000	2832880	like people are like no idiot they mean whether they're like well what do you
2832880	2836160	mean like like like but it's legitimate questions I'm like what do you what is
2836160	2840440	this a time bomb like what am I shitting in yeah that's tough that's a
2840440	2844560	tough one we have if you're flushing something that has become waste like no
2844560	2848120	matter what it is that's that's what you would write on this side if I am
2848120	2853640	flushing this baby shark in the toilet and yeah I worked in an office in
2853640	2859360	Chicago of all therapists and for whatever reason random turds kept
2859360	2863880	showing up on the on the women's bathroom floor for weeks at a time how
2863880	2870440	do you know they were random they were different people each time figure out
2870440	2873280	we just call it a phantom shitter we couldn't figure out if it was like
2873280	2878760	falling out of a pant leg or if it was intentional it was not a happy workplace
2878760	2882160	I'm really fascinated with that stuff like I because I think it's like an
2882160	2886920	eruption of like it's sort of like shoplifting yeah it's like an urban
2886920	2891360	phenomenon like among people who are like like like there's one thing it's
2891360	2894440	like oh you saw that Canadian video where the woman just shits on the floor
2894440	2898200	of the restaurant there's it but I was I saw that I was like there's no mystery
2898200	2901560	to this she's asking to go to the bathroom she's infuriated she had she
2901560	2905320	and then she died then I found out later I was totally right totally nailed it I
2905320	2910240	know my shitting people and but but it fascinates me when people are like I
2910240	2917080	lived in an apartment complex and for six weeks every three days like in the
2917080	2923080	dryer yeah and it was like it's some cereal yeah like person that's like
2923080	2928280	there it's that's so fascinating to me either I think some form of rage that
2928280	2932600	you can only really express through your shit that's a targeted because I have
2932600	2937640	you know when you get you're so angry you can only shit it out I don't but I'm
2937640	2941000	clearly someone that I were and I we all kept being like oh I hope no one
2941000	2945880	thinks it's me I mean like I left that job and I was like please let the phantom
2945880	2950320	shitter continue it's on me and the phantom shitter did oh that would be
2950320	2956520	great right and then that person stopped it was just an elaborate revenge on you
2956520	2960960	35 people who just like oh Emily yeah I saw that movie was pretty good she shit
2960960	2965200	on the floor at that one place when the killer when they arrest the wrong guy
2965200	2968320	and then the and then the kid there's like that period of time where the real
2968320	2973400	killer is like I could hang up my jersey and I'm like no I gotta kill more
2973400	2977200	people all right you can leave jail guy but there is some kind of like modern
2977200	2980480	like it's like getting your hands dirty in a world where we don't really do that
2980480	2985200	anymore I'm starting to kind of get it I guess I mean I say that's what's because
2985200	2988440	you know that the person who takes a shit in their apartment buildings dryer
2988440	2993440	every Wednesday is not also a serial killer yes like they're not they're
2993440	2997240	probably not torturing animals or something it's like it's such a weird
2997240	3003640	pinprick like magma eruption I that's what I picture this person like going
3003640	3007360	like the Ally McBeal you know like going to work as a legal clerk and being like
3007360	3011800	and in conclusion my PowerPoint and she's like good job Daphne and she's
3011800	3016240	like you got it moving on up over and then the full moon comes up and she's
3016240	3021120	like I have to do this or else I can't succeed and it's like all of her the
3021120	3024520	ghost of her father going like women mean nothing and she's like I'll shit
3024520	3029320	you into a dryer turn you on high heat and then you just hear the thudding
3029320	3033120	going don't don't don't is it weird that I always picture a woman when it's like
3033120	3036920	the phantom pooping because we're not allowed to express our anger any other
3036920	3042560	way again I was shoplifting a female thing you can let me off the hook like
3042560	3046280	only no if you weren't here and I said that I would get that's right yeah that's
3046280	3050280	right women but also that woman remembers to do it once a week yeah it's
3050280	3057440	self-getter in a way what are you doing oh you know I take five minutes every
3057440	3064840	morning you know just sort of hang out with friends I'm bad and I'll have like a
3064840	3074960	bagel all right I feel like I feel like everybody everybody's like oh you you
3074960	3081800	talk too much about shit just a little too much like I have a gripe I have an
3081800	3089680	issue what is it you guys have this gripe no okay listen up just lift what's
3089680	3094280	up with the air conditioning you know what's up with the AC really you get in
3094280	3101560	the car and it's fucking summer hot summer hottest summer in record here you
3101560	3107480	get in there and it's a hotbox it's fucking hot hot hot and the first thing

3319560	3326360	she was slowly turning it off like slowly yeah and I went okay and I rolled
3326360	3331880	down my window and then she turns around and goes what's going on do we want AC
3331880	3339560	or fresh air yeah you shouldn't turn on you shouldn't open the window when the
3339560	3344880	AC's on that's an insane person thing to do if it's not cold enough it's
3344880	3350120	actually like maybe use your mouth then like request things like a human here
3350120	3356720	when somebody says hey do you want AC and I go yes and you slowly turn it off
3356720	3361520	what she was that she was old she gets too cold also I'll say that people who
3361520	3365160	drive left and over don't make them know they don't make the money little money
3365160	3381920	from AC's that helps them pay the rent and it's the hottest summer in record
3381920	3385600	how I change your underwear half it through the day how much fucking money
3385600	3389560	do you save by not using AC I know I see the spreadsheet of it that's what I'm
3389560	3392940	saying I want to see at the end of everyone's there how much hound through
3392940	3397460	town you actually do spend a lot of money is it $30 a week but what is it
3397460	3403860	highway it doesn't make a bit of it depends on how much is it $4 a month use
3403860	3408540	your mouth like a human being yeah use your mouth like a human most of your
3408540	3413980	complaint is I shouldn't have to ask for AC yes yeah we'll ask for it I never I
3413980	3418460	shouldn't have to ask for AC I'm the hottest summer in the history of the
3418460	3422980	world but it's not a problem when you have a mouth you can use and you do yes
3422980	3428100	it is a problem no it's not yes it is it is a problem it's just a thing that
3428100	3431860	happens you know you do it's a problem Rob when you get in the car if it's too
3431860	3436380	hot inside you do a chameleon get naked okay

3518820	3527520	ziplock crap sack it's got a pocket for toilet paper yeah anybody in our
3527520	3532860	audience we can crowdsource this like try to try to restrain yourself like if
3532860	3536900	you really feel like you have something concise and from an expert place that we
3536900	3543820	can defer to that like like like I really want to know the data on the cost
3543820	3555700	of air conditioning it's it's been myth bust yes you save money by not using the
3555700	3559940	AC yeah I know you save more money by not air conditioning the car than if you
3559940	3564100	don't but I just want to know what the scale of it is yeah like if is it is if
3564100	3571900	you save five dollars worth of gas how often like just driving me from one side
3571900	3577040	of the town well it's not gonna be fun yeah so get a five-dollar tip it's an
3577040	3583120	option I don't they don't say they don't get the tip they don't see who tips yeah
3583120	3596220	how would let no pre that you're gonna tip before they just come up here and
3596220	3599660	give us a little bit of information from your perspective we want we won't we
3599660	3617940	won't attack or what's your name sir I'm Christian Christian okay you don't
3617940	3621500	have to tell us anything about yourself that you don't want us to know but stop
3621500	3625820	it you fuck you're right give us your love you give us your background why why
3625820	3635460	you might have knowledge about this so I went to UC San Diego oh it's very hot
3635460	3639740	there yeah it's hot there and I got a degree in computer engineering and now
3639740	3645900	I'm an uber driver how many degrees intersection of expertise okay yeah yeah
3645900	3653100	so yeah you can you can see who tips you thank you I've been wanting to know
3653100	3660420	this thank you hey I don't know are you doing did you just do the world's most
3660420	3667660	perfect joke or are you do you how much money does AC for the AC I mean I guess
3667660	3671540	you can you can save a little bit of cash see so you were actually here to
3671540	3678540	answer the other questions sit around in a car that's hot and be an animal this
3678540	3683940	was not why you were brought up yes it is yes it is he's a opinion on whether
3683940	3688860	or not it's good to be in heat we all agree it's bad to be in heat he's he's
3688860	3695460	acquitting it there's nine people up here he's he's saying if I could talk
3695460	3704700	over you for a second let him talk for fuck's sake all right go ahead okay well
3704700	3709300	here's what I heard you say it's what shrab is saying which is basically like
3709300	3715700	I like the savings on air conditioning are probably in comparison to the
3715700	3719620	jeopardy you know that you're just saying that because now you're on the
3719620	3722140	spot and we are a different question than the one you thought you were
3722140	3728780	answering no all right he went to he was doing a funny joke to open he gained
3728780	3733660	everyone's esteem and I don't think he was doing a joke I think he thought that
3733660	3739500	was the question whether or not I wish we could someone find out what his
3739500	3744020	intentions were all right thank you Christian
3744020	3753740	it does anyone know how much money it doesn't save a lot of money but these
3753740	3758300	are people who don't make a lot of money and a lot of the money they make goes to
3758300	3763540	pay the costs of them doing their job yep which is what which is paying for
3763540	3767300	the car paying for the gas for the car paint for me that's their job that's a
3767300	3772460	big part of their job job is to pay for the car what what their offices do you
3772460	3778180	think this is funny job Spencer if we fill driving with our awareness that
3778180	3783180	people who work everyday jobs are unfairly paid can we do we have to be so
3783180	3787020	distracted by that when we're discussing this other thing well that's the reason
3787020	3790460	why you're uncomfortable though and I agree that being uncomfortable is not a
3790460	3794820	good thing but it's just the thing that has a reason right but I understand the
3794820	3799020	reason we have any air conditioning cost does anyone driver out of their
3799020	3805140	overhead I would know that if it's my biggest problem the surprise oh you want
3805140	3811260	the air conditioning on as sweat is just dripping off everybody's face it's like
3811260	3815300	if you're a restaurant and you get water because people are usually thirsty when
3815300	3818860	they're eating their friends so for you it's a water if she had been like hey I
3818860	3823020	know it's very hot I didn't have it on because I'm saving money because I'm not
3823020	3827660	super rich you'd be okay is it okay do you want the AC or not so she does a
3827660	3834060	little guilt trip to you before before you know that would be awesome right I
3834060	3841580	I'm Kevin ten percent Kevin day just came down with the day thanks Kevin it's
3841580	3849180	ten with Kevin day everybody ten percent ten percent fuel efficiency is
3849180	3853980	lost Kevin by having the air on that's ten percent fuel of ten percent of
3853980	3858940	anything is significant yeah literally on the way here we're low on gas and you
3858940	3870580	were like let's turn off the AC I had a friend it's so stupid when we were 16
3870580	3876260	that he was like we wanted out of gas we got to turn off the radio I've done
3876260	3882740	that I've done that well depends on what songs playing all right so ride share
3882740	3887700	operators within the sound of our voice we're in desert cities where it gets to
3887700	3892820	120 degrees Fahrenheit like we need to have this conversation among the many
3892820	3897460	things that are unfair to drivers they're ten percent of their overhead as
3897460	3901700	opposed to someone in Minnesota is like it's an important thing and we're
3901700	3907460	feeling at first here having the conversation and I'm sure it'll be fixed
3907460	3912900	by next week yeah solve that but ten percent so fucking lots so much ever I
3912900	3916420	would have always assumed when I heard my parents talking about like oh we're
3916420	3919900	gonna get you know don't don't turn up that I was in my head I was always like
3919900	3923100	yeah and we should always eat generic peanut butter cuz the hospital bills
3923100	3926940	lately like I was like I bet this doesn't add up to anything ten percent
3926940	3935660	a lot there's a hundred percent there's also this thing where people who are
3935660	3940780	doing the share sort of in the share movement are compromising themselves so
3940780	3945260	when you hear somebody asked for them to compromise themselves a little bit more
3945260	3951820	it kind of sparks a nerve well at the same time if you're gonna do the job you
3951820	3956060	should probably have a cool cabin I get that but I also get the like we can't
3956060	3961180	ask these slaves to fry our burgers well to be clear we should definitely ask for
3961180	3965620	it to be cold we should want it to be cold but while doing that just understand
3965620	3971740	why it is the way it is I mean all the feelings are completely great yes it's
3971740	3977300	good this is good let's roll the clip that's great yeah should we shut you a
3977300	3984780	clip of us having this exact conversation a year ago what we haven't
3984780	3987820	solved it oh my god I mean part of the reason they have the conversation is
3987820	3993540	because maybe a ride service would say hey we're adding a button that for three
3993540	3999260	dollars extra for ten percent of the thing you the the driver will receive an
3999260	4004380	alert that says please cool down your cabin as you roll up if I was a driver I
4004380	4008060	would never pick that person up I would be like that guy's an asshole you're
4008060	4013380	telling me ahead of time like I get a certain way so come correct when you come
4013380	4018780	to me I'd be like bye come that must be nice I like that you'd be that picky but
4018780	4023200	like if people really wanted it that badly if you live in Arizona and every
4023200	4026860	time you take a rideshare service your big fucking problem is that unlike a cab
4026860	4031500	which runs on a medallion service you climb in and it's fucking overhead paid
4031500	4037500	by the corrupt you know medallion service do this it's cool as hell and
4037500	4040260	then every time a lift comes it's like hot you have to have the conversation
4040260	4043660	like if I don't know what the statistics are the next thing Kevin Day needs to
4043660	4047980	come down and go like here's how many people have a problem with like being I
4047980	4052340	I've always noticed it I've always noticed that conversation I've always
4052340	4056580	found it like kind of like crazy and absurd I find it way less absurd and
4056580	4065380	like the 10% of anything is like huge so now that can reduce my outrage by at
4065380	4071340	least 10% if not 90 because if I get in I'm like it's hot it feels like empathy
4071340	4078640	for the poor like like like now I can now I can fucking use that heat to make
4078640	4085820	me stronger as a liberal great now I have everything plus I have a Tesla so
4086540	4092100	unless I'm super drunk I don't need your hot-ass car I learned about this from
4092100	4095780	cabs I got in like four cabs in a row and that's what they were doing and I
4095780	4098700	was like what the fuck and then I looked it up and they're like saves a lot of
4098700	4103500	money and I was like I guess if that's your job and then I never did this did
4103500	4107140	this issue I remember in the Milwaukee days like you know when we would like
4107140	4111020	fill up our tank a dollar at a time and yeah we're not gonna make it to Dale's
4111020	4113860	house in time to get drunk and they'll be like I'm gonna turn off the air
4113860	4117940	conditioner and I was up but I always wondered like what does that mean per
4117940	4124980	mile now we know hey who wants to listen to the time that open mic Eagle taught
4124980	4133380	me to drop my mama fucking crutch okay nobody I do fuck you or we also have we
4133380	4139620	have some hits on here there's there's Rob shrubs all she at she apps all right
4139620	4143900	have fun for a minute and 35 seconds
4169620	4182980	shit fucking shit man ha shit oh my ass let's let's let's bring game master
4182980	4198440	spencer clicking it out
4212980	4216980	My thumbs are greasy from all those chiaps that I eat.
4218980	4220980	I eat a lot of chiaps.
4220980	4222980	Alright, I don't have anything else.
4222980	4224980	Chiaps are delicious.
4224980	4227980	I had some chiaps before I came here.
4227980	4230980	Alright, so I think we'll do things in here.
4230980	4232980	Hashtag chiaps.
4238980	4240980	Why would you hashtag chiaps?
4242980	4251980	I think the frustrating thing is that if you back it up and you play it really slowly,
4251980	4253980	you can hear as I'm getting interrupted.
4253980	4258980	I was like, that was 2011, and I'm like, I think we should do more for women's rights.
4258980	4263980	Like, I'm getting interrupted in the corner with great things.
4263980	4266980	I'm like, I have an idea for a show called Rick and Morty at one point,
4266980	4269980	but it got delayed by three years because of that bit.
4269980	4271980	It's all chiaps-folk.
4271980	4274980	Chris, can we play Cheepy Peepy Gates?
4280980	4282980	There we go, Cheepy Peepy Gates.
4283980	4286980	This is of course with the sweet switch-up.
4287980	4293980	I came over today to test drive my iPad Pro to see if he wants to get one himself.
4293980	4296980	I have two of them too.
4296980	4300980	I got the big one and decided it was too heavy, and I like the smaller one.
4300980	4303980	Maybe if I like it, I could buy one of yours off of you.
4303980	4304980	I could buy one.
4304980	4305980	He needs both of them.
4305980	4307980	I don't have enough respect for my money.
4307980	4312980	I'd rather have my iPad Pro back and just you go get your own.
4312980	4320980	What am I going to do with that fair market price for a 12.9 inch iPad Pro that I charge my friend?
4320980	4326980	Just give me the blue book value, and then I'm going to have a stack of $20 bills
4326980	4330980	that I do what with that's not going to be karmically damaging to me.
4330980	4331980	Yeah, come on.
4331980	4332980	What the fuck are you thinking?
4332980	4334980	It's a choice between giving it to you as a gift.
4334980	4336980	What could somebody do with a stack of money?
4336980	4340980	Think you're going to buy him his own iPad Pro or you're going to make him buy his own rock?
4340980	4342980	I don't need him to buy me anything.
4342980	4344980	I'd probably do that before.
4344980	4347980	I don't want your gifts.
4347980	4352980	He's a little Cheepy Peepy, so he's going to test drive.
4352980	4355980	He's a little Cheepy Peepy, as you call me.
4355980	4357980	I'm not a Cheepy Peepy, Dan.
4357980	4358980	Fucking take it back.
4358980	4360980	You're kind of a Cheepy Peepy.
4360980	4361980	I'm not a Cheepy Peepy.
4361980	4363980	I wanted to know if it worked.
4363980	4370980	We were talking on the plane, and you said, well, I could let me try it out, and I'll give it back,
4370980	4372980	and I'll buy my own.
4372980	4375980	That's not a Cheepy Peepy that's being smart.
4375980	4387980	I'm not a Cheepy Peepy, Dan, Dan, Dan.
4392980	4394980	There was some editing there.
4396980	4398980	Can we see the Open Mic Eagle one, too?
4398980	4400980	Now I'm curious what that is.
4400980	4402980	Let's say Open Mic Eagle.
4402980	4404980	Let's do the Open Mic Eagle one.
4404980	4406980	That's a good one, too.
4406980	4408980	Can you all see okay?
4408980	4409980	Probably not.
4409980	4410980	Wait, did you want to talk about something?
4410980	4411980	No, no.
4411980	4414980	I'm just experiencing anxiety for...
4433980	4434980	Thank you.
4434980	4438980	It's called having a crutch, but mine used to be when I'm on the mic.
4438980	4440980	I love that.
4440980	4441980	It'd be like, my name's Mike Eagle.
4441980	4443980	When I'm on the mic, I say hi to people.
4443980	4444980	You know what I mean?
4444980	4446980	So how do you deal with crutches?
4446980	4448980	Did you take a hacksaw to them?
4448980	4450980	Yeah, you become conscious of them, and you just try not to.
4450980	4457980	But it's there for a reason, because we do that to help us fill the time between what we said
4457980	4459980	and where we have to get to.
4459980	4461980	And the enemy is starting to think...
4461980	4462980	No.
4462980	4464980	The enemy is stopping.
4464980	4466980	That's the only enemy is stopping.
4466980	4467980	You just keep going.
4467980	4468980	Just like...
4468980	4470980	Oh, rapid.
4474980	4477980	Oh, rapid.
4477980	4478980	It's not easy, people.
4478980	4480980	It's not easy.
4480980	4482980	Salt, pepper, fork, spoon.
4482980	4485980	Oh, sun and the moon.
4485980	4487980	I got a solar system that's going round and round.
4487980	4490980	I got my voice in my brain, and the brain is the sound.
4490980	4491980	I got to flow through the rap.
4491980	4493980	I got to flow through the people.
4493980	4495980	Here's the motherfucking church, and I don't go to the steeple,
4495980	4498980	because I go to the altar, and I pray to God.
4498980	4501980	I drop down to my knees, and I let him through my body.
4501980	4506980	I want to get down with you to the break of dawn.
4510980	4511980	Go, Mike.
4511980	4512980	Go, Mike.
4512980	4515980	Hey, he didn't fuck one mother in that at all.
4516980	4519980	You don't do much, and you don't do such.
4519980	4521980	If you don't do what you're supposed to do,
4521980	4522980	then you do what you're going to do.
4522980	4524980	If you don't do what you're going to do,
4524980	4525980	you do what you've always done.
4525980	4527980	I'm going to have fun and run in the sun.
4527980	4530980	I'm going to be on the beach and make another one of my buns
4530980	4532980	by cooking it in an oven,
4532980	4535980	and putting in the shoving with my dick.
4535980	4536980	Okay.
4536980	4537980	Yeah.
4537980	4539980	You put your dick in the muffin if you want to.
4539980	4541980	Fuck the bread impromptu.
4541980	4542980	Yeah.
4546980	4547980	Wow.
4548980	4549980	Wow.
4549980	4552980	That was some great rapping I learned to do that episode
4552980	4554980	and then never went back.
4555980	4558980	I think that is truly one of the things that I'm most ashamed of,
4558980	4560980	like, I kind of cry, because, like,
4560980	4562980	Open Mic came in the show.
4562980	4563980	You felt that.
4563980	4564980	That was like a...
4564980	4565980	It was real.
4565980	4567980	It's funny, but it was also real.
4567980	4570980	It was like, yeah, you got to get up the fuck your mama thing,
4570980	4572980	because it has nothing to do with mamas or fucking,
4572980	4574980	but it's like this cadence thing.
4574980	4576980	And then I was like, oh, you got to ditch that,
4576980	4577980	and then that happened.
4577980	4579980	But I never, ever, like...
4579980	4580980	It sucks.
4580980	4581980	I never went back.
4581980	4582980	I never...
4582980	4583980	I was never able to...
4583980	4585980	I just went right back to the crutches.
4585980	4586980	I'm ashamed.
4586980	4587980	I'm ashamed of it.
4587980	4588980	And that's why we never...
4588980	4589980	Let's fix that right now.
4589980	4590980	We never brought Open Mic back.
4590980	4591980	Yeah.
4591980	4592980	Open Mic keeps saying, can I come back on the show?
4592980	4593980	I'm like, no, you can't.
4593980	4594980	I'm ashamed of myself.
4594980	4595980	No, I'm kidding.
4595980	4596980	He's busy.
4599980	4601980	Oh, shit.
4604980	4605980	Toast.
4605980	4606980	Bread.
4606980	4607980	Go in the head.
4607980	4609980	I didn't fuck your mama instead.
4611980	4612980	All right.
4612980	4613980	All right.
4614980	4615980	Wrap!
4617980	4618980	Hold up.
4618980	4620980	Zach, you got one of those new beats?
4623980	4624980	Zach, are you with us?
4625980	4626980	You have that?
4627980	4628980	I've got all this on the phone.
4628980	4630980	I like the idea that it's like sod.
4630980	4631980	You get into that new...
4632980	4634980	That'll make the Golden Retriever shit in the right spot.
4638980	4640980	This is a little more contemplative, Dan.
4640980	4642980	So I'm like, dig deep here.
4642980	4643980	Yeah.
4643980	4644980	Yeah.
4644980	4645980	Yeah.
4645980	4646980	Yeah.
4646980	4647980	Yeah.
4647980	4648980	Yeah.
4648980	4649980	Yeah.
4649980	4650980	Yeah.
4650980	4651980	Oh.
4651980	4652980	Yeah.
4652980	4653980	Oh.
4653980	4654980	Yeah.
4654980	4655980	Oh.
4655980	4656980	Oh.
4656980	4657980	Oh.
4657980	4658980	Yeah.
4658980	4659980	Oh.
4659980	4660980	The wind.
4660980	4661980	And the spirit.
4661980	4662980	And the tent.
4662980	4664980	You never fear it.
4664980	4665980	Ow.
4665980	4666980	Ow.
4666980	4667980	Ow.
4667980	4668980	Ow.
4668980	4669980	And the Irish.
4669980	4670980	Ow.
4670980	4671980	Ow.
4671980	4672980	Ow.

4674980	4675980	And the Scottish.
4675980	4676980	Trines.
4676980	4681980	Need to be respected by the Pope.
4681980	4682980	Ow.
4682980	4683980	Cranberries.
4683980	4684980	Sinead O'Connor.
4684980	4685980	Michael Stipe.
4685980	4686980	What?
4686980	4687980	Break it down.
4687980	4693980	My name is M.C. Dick.
4694980	4695980	Break it down.
4695980	4699980	My name is M.C. Dick.
4699980	4701980	I'm here to give your balls a lick.
4701980	4708980	I'm gonna slather my tongue upon the shaft and go and take a run at your anus.
4708980	4710980	Give you a rim job.
4710980	4711980	I'm not here to be neat.
4711980	4713980	I'm gonna be a slob.
4713980	4720980	I'm gonna slather all my saliva all over your privates.
4720980	4729980	That's not what open mic taught me.
4729980	4733980	I see his Jedi ghost shaking his head.
4733980	4735980	That's not.
4735980	4739980	Just because you're not fucking your mama doesn't mean you're not crutching.
4739980	4740980	Yo.
4740980	4743980	I feel the spirit.
4743980	4745980	Do you hear it?
4745980	4749980	I'm gonna rap inside my mind and share it.
4749980	4757980	I'm gonna flow from my brain to my mouth and not rhyme anything with south.
4757980	4758980	It's over.
4758980	4759980	It's over.
4759980	4760980	Oh, damn.
4760980	4761980	Oh, damn.
4761980	4768980	I mean, I was very impressed by that.
4768980	4773980	You know, it's a good show because we've been through a lot on stage.
4773980	4777980	That was interesting because there were clips in there where we didn't have the audience
4777980	4778980	and then we did have the audience.
4778980	4780980	Like the cheapy peepy thing, there was no audience, right?
4780980	4781980	Yeah.
4781980	4783980	I mean, I wonder...
4783980	4784980	They didn't like it.
4784980	4785980	They couldn't afford it.
4785980	4787980	They didn't like it.
4787980	4791980	Yeah, we had a lot of good times, but you know, we had some bad times too.
4791980	4793980	Oh, we also had some bad times.
4793980	4799980	No, I'm just making that up.
4799980	4801980	It's 11 seconds long.
4801980	4805980	Can we do Jim Belushi impression?
4805980	4806980	Tipping that a bit.
4806980	4808980	Yeah, it was.
4808980	4811980	Well, he didn't say we could.
4811980	4812980	Oh.
4812980	4813980	I do like...
4813980	4816980	Mitch, have you got a Jim Belushi impression for me?
4816980	4817980	No video.
4817980	4818980	Why are we looking?
4818980	4821980	Jim Belushi impression is not very good, so yes.
4821980	4822980	There you go.
4822980	4824980	There it is.
4824980	4826980	You're number one.
4826980	4829980	That was your 11 second clip.
4829980	4834980	We asked him, do you do a John Belushi impression because I can do a bad Jim Belushi impression.
4834980	4835980	No.
4835980	4838980	You do a Jim Belushi impression, but it's not that good, so yes.
4838980	4839980	Yeah, that's agreed.
4839980	4841980	Yeah, that one's too long.
4841980	4843980	What's Ryan Ridley impression?
4843980	4845980	I don't know what that is.
4845980	4847980	Well, Emily loves that one.
4847980	4848980	What is Ryan Ridley impression?
4848980	4851980	No, let's do Curtis Armstrong's scream spells.
4851980	4853980	That one's good.
4853980	4856980	This is some good D&D.
4856980	4857980	I love Curtis.
4857980	4860980	Is this one a video?
4860980	4868980	Hey, Doc, I remember what you said back there about me maybe...
4868980	4869980	But you could have done better.
4869980	4871980	I could have done better.
4871980	4874980	It's hard because we live in this world.
4874980	4879980	It just reinforces the fact that you're not supposed to be free, you're not supposed to be happy.
4879980	4882980	I've never felt like I deserve happiness.
4882980	4885980	It's not true.
4885980	4889980	You're a decent girl.
4889980	4891980	You could have anything.
4891980	4894980	I just don't want your life to be like mine.
4894980	4903980	And if you need some more convincing, why don't I show you what my old friend, Dr. Friend, can do spell-wise.
4903980	4905980	Take it away, Dr. Friend.
4905980	4907980	Agony! Agony spells!
4907980	4910980	Jesus!
4910980	4913980	Agony!
4913980	4915980	Agony!
4915980	4918980	It induces terrible pain!
4918980	4920980	Same team! Same team!
4920980	4921980	In the target!
4921980	4922980	He's the guy that pays us!
4922980	4924980	Until it is deactivated!
4924980	4926980	Jesus Christ!
4926980	4943980	There, I've created a dome or wall of magical energy.
4943980	4951980	Ramagam!
4951980	4954980	Osama!
4954980	4958980	Physical barrier!
4958980	4968980	Can I use my agony spell on the guy, even though he's getting away, but it's a long distance agony spell?
4968980	4969980	Can I do one of those?
4969980	4973980	You don't have line of sight to him. He's far, far off.
4973980	4982980	But my mother could do that without seeing me.
4982980	4991980	Agony! Agony!
4991980	4994980	Fly, Eagle!
4995980	4998980	Wow.
4998980	5002980	Wow.
5002980	5004980	We're gonna get that guy back.
5004980	5005980	We're gonna get Curtis back.
5005980	5007980	He was really into it.
5007980	5008980	He was really into it.
5008980	5012980	I look like halfway through that sequence there's like this crazy Easter show.
5012980	5013980	Easter?
5013980	5014980	What was that?
5014980	5018980	That's the blessing of 300 episodes is that you're like, what the fuck happened?
5018980	5019980	What?
5019980	5022980	Also, a series of horrible haircuts by me.
5023980	5026980	Yeah, well, look.
5026980	5028980	Oh, okay.
5028980	5030980	Emily, how are your freestyle rapping skills?
5030980	5033980	Not worthy.
5033980	5035980	Not even, no, no.
5035980	5037980	Let's see, not worthy.
5037980	5038980	Let's try it.
5038980	5041980	Get a beat. Emily will do it.
5041980	5043980	Yeah.
5043980	5044980	Go ahead.
5044980	5045980	It's like pooping in a bag.
5045980	5047980	Yeah.
5047980	5051980	You and Kamal, Kamal and both of you together know.
5051980	5052980	Yes, you fucking can.
5052980	5054980	Well, then you just goaded me into doing it, so now you have to do it, too.
5054980	5055980	I got to do it.
5055980	5056980	Look at me, turn and face me.
5056980	5057980	Look at me.
5057980	5058980	We got this.
5058980	5059980	Steve, do it.
5059980	5060980	I'm not gonna do it.
5060980	5061980	Tell me.
5061980	5063980	We are...
5063980	5065980	That's really hard.
5065980	5066980	That's really hard.
5066980	5067980	Let's keep trying.
5067980	5068980	Let's keep trying.
5068980	5069980	Oh, yeah.
5069980	5070980	Let's keep trying.
5070980	5072980	That was just the first take.
5072980	5073980	Let's try again.
5073980	5074980	Let's try again.
5074980	5075980	Make Steve rap.
5075980	5076980	Steve rap.
5076980	5077980	Steve should rap.
5077980	5078980	Steve rap.
5078980	5079980	Face each other.
5079980	5080980	Let's try this one more time.
5080980	5081980	Kamal and Emily go.
5081980	5082980	Come on, let's go.
5082980	5083980	You got this.
5083980	5084980	No, I can't do it.
5084980	5085980	Okay.
5085980	5086980	You got this.
5086980	5087980	Let's go.
5087980	5088980	It's like change and draw.
5088980	5089980	I'll do the start and then you fill in the word that'll rhyme, okay?
5089980	5090980	Okay.
5090980	5091980	This is impossible.
5091980	5092980	Just do it any single time.
5092980	5093980	Hell, yeah.
5093980	5094980	I think I can...
5094980	5095980	Okay.
5095980	5096980	It's hard.
5096980	5097980	It's hard.
5097980	5098980	How can you have a word that...
5098980	5100980	How can you have a word that...
5100980	5101980	No, no.
5101980	5102980	No, but there wasn't a rhyming.
5102980	5103980	There was no word to rhyme it with.
5103980	5104980	No, you're supposed to pick the word.
5104980	5105980	Okay, all right.
5105980	5106980	Start it.
5106980	5109980	Yeah, do it.
5109980	5110980	First day of rap camp.
5110980	5111980	Let's go.
5111980	5112980	Let's go.
5112980	5115980	First day of rap camp and I opened up my locker.
5115980	5116980	Locker.
5116980	5117980	Locker.
5117980	5118980	That was the word.
5118980	5119980	That was the whole sentence.
5119980	5120980	Out the gate, locker is a hard word.
5120980	5121980	No.
5121980	5122980	Locker is a hard word.
5122980	5123980	No, you are going to give me...
5123980	5124980	No, you are going to...
5124980	5125980	Okay.
5125980	5126980	You give me...
5126980	5127980	This is good.
5127980	5128980	It's good.
5128980	5130980	Don't do the last word and I'll do the last word.
5130980	5131980	Let's start with the A's.
5131980	5134980	My crutches are just going to be like pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy.
5134980	5135980	Go ahead.
5135980	5136980	Hell, yeah.
5136980	5138980	Let's just start with the A's.
5138980	5139980	A's.
5139980	5140980	Work our way through the E's.
5140980	5141980	I've got A's.
5141980	5142980	What?
5142980	5143980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5143980	5144980	Oh, no.
5144980	5151980	This is the way of all the clips for our 400th episode.
5151980	5156980	Go ahead and don't say the last word at the line and I'll say the word.
5156980	5158980	I wake up in the morning and I go to...
5158980	5159980	Bathroom.
5159980	5160980	Keep going.
5160980	5161980	Keep going.
5161980	5162980	Keep going.
5162980	5167980	I never even know what I'm going to do.
5167980	5168980	Go ahead.
5168980	5169980	I didn't hear.
5169980	5173980	I never really know when I'm going to go...
5173980	5174980	Bathroom.
5174980	5178980	I think we're done here.
5178980	5181980	Is that...
5181980	5182980	Incredible.
5182980	5185980	Run DM passive aggressive.
5185980	5190980	What a dang name of duo.
5190980	5191980	Bathroom.
5191980	5192980	Thank you.
5192980	5195980	That is awful.
5196980	5205980	I don't think that you should be learning from me, but a trade secret is you come up
5205980	5211980	with a word and then while you think of the rhyme for that word, you say, I fucked your
5211980	5213980	mama so hard that I...
5213980	5215980	That gives you just enough time.
5215980	5219980	So you're just like, went to the kitchen and had some milk.
5219980	5221980	Fucked your mama so hard I felt like...
5221980	5224980	Silk, silk, silk.
5224980	5226980	That's where the crutch comes in.
5226980	5227980	Okay.
5227980	5230980	So it would be like, I woke up in the morning, go to the bathroom, fucked your mama so hard
5230980	5232980	in that bathroom.
5232980	5233980	Yeah.
5233980	5234980	Yeah.
5234980	5235980	Dreaming.
5235980	5236980	Go Camille.
5236980	5237980	Keep it up.
5237980	5238980	Keep that rhyme scheme going.
5238980	5240980	Took off my shirt because I was in the bathroom.
5240980	5241980	Bathroom.
5241980	5244980	Flushed the toilet because I'm a grown man in a bathroom.
5244980	5245980	Bathroom.
5245980	5250980	Put up the A.T. because it's hot in this bathroom.
5250980	5251980	Bathroom.
5251980	5252980	Okay.
5252980	5253980	10% of your overhead.
5253980	5254980	10% of your overhead.
5254980	5255980	10% of your bathroom.
5255980	5256980	In the bathroom.
5256980	5257980	10% of your overhead.
5257980	5258980	In the bathroom.
5258980	5259980	10% of your overhead.
5259980	5267980	Yo, M.C. air conditioning is in the house.
5267980	5271980	Be aware of it.
5271980	5273980	Don't know what side I'm on.
5273980	5276980	Keep the air conditioning on.
5276980	5278980	I don't know if you should or shouldn't.
5278980	5281980	Fucked your mama so hard it wasn't pregnant.
5281980	5285980	I'm going to pick you up.
5285980	5288980	It's going to be 900 degrees.
5288980	5289980	Fuck you.
5289980	5293980	Ooh, I'm part of the hoi poi.
5293980	5295980	So I ironically have the high road.
5295980	5298980	It doesn't make a ton of sense.
5298980	5303980	But it'll shut you up if you're thinking about complaining about it.
5303980	5306980	In the bathroom.
5306980	5309980	I want to hear Emily on that vocal thing.
5309980	5311980	Can you pass it up, Mike, then?
5311980	5312980	Wait.
5312980	5313980	Put Emily on that mic.
5313980	5314980	I want to hear her vocal.
5314980	5315980	Go ahead, Mike.
5315980	5316980	Yeah.
5316980	5317980	Okay.
5317980	5318980	Hi.
5318980	5319980	Hi.
5319980	5320980	Hi.
5320980	5321980	In the bathroom.
5321980	5324980	I'm here to take your mom to prom.
5324980	5327980	I'm a fucking whore in the bathroom.
5327980	5328980	Wrong?
5328980	5329980	Yeah, yeah.
5329980	5330980	Yeah?
5330980	5331980	Yeah.
5331980	5332980	Yeah.
5332980	5333980	Then what?
5333980	5335980	And I eat cereal every day.
5335980	5338980	I get it on the carpet and I say, okay.
5338980	5345980	And then I go into the bathroom.
5345980	5346980	The bathroom.
5346980	5347980	Thank you.
5347980	5348980	Thank you.
5348980	5349980	All right.
5349980	5350980	Give Camille that mic.
5350980	5353980	Give Camille the mic.
5353980	5354980	You have to partake.
5354980	5355980	No.
5355980	5356980	Oh, that's so great.
5356980	5358980	It's fun.
5358980	5361980	You can do a little alien route if you want to.
5361980	5362980	Everybody don't do it.
5362980	5366980	All the spirits won't come off.
5367980	5368980	Yeah.
5368980	5370980	You're in the flow.
5370980	5371980	Emily, please.
5371980	5374980	You're in the flow.
5374980	5381980	If that's a joke about my period, I don't appreciate it.
5381980	5382980	That's my crunch.
5382980	5383980	Okay, go.
5383980	5386980	I don't know how to rap at all.
5386980	5394980	Here I am, fucking your mom in the stall.
5394980	5395980	In the bathroom.
5395980	5396980	In the bathroom.
5396980	5398980	Have a take your friend out one night.
5398980	5401980	Have a real good time in the bathroom.
5401980	5404980	In the bathroom.
5404980	5407980	That was good.
5407980	5410980	All right, we did it.
5410980	5413980	I have no rhythm at all.
5413980	5414980	That's the problem.
5414980	5416980	And the solution.
5416980	5417980	Yeah.
5417980	5419980	In the bathroom.
5419980	5425980	It reminds me of the time that John Muir rapped on our show.
5425980	5428980	For one minute and 24 seconds.
5428980	5432980	I like that we're having a brilliant 1980s clip show.
5432980	5433980	I love this.
5433980	5437980	John Muir's flow was fucking like crazy.
5437980	5442980	Should have been a roast.
5442980	5443980	I'm going to drive home.
5443980	5445980	Your body is a wonderland.
5445980	5446980	It's going to get in my head.
5446980	5447980	It's going to corkscrew.
5447980	5449980	It's going to say, John, fuck you.
5449980	5451980	There's some things you just shouldn't do.
5451980	5453980	You're going to run the whole transcript through the brick.
5453980	5455980	You call the brain and then you're going to complain.
5455980	5457980	You're going to ask if you can take it out.
5457980	5459980	The next time they put it up on the net, you're going to say,
5459980	5461980	uh, that thing I'd rather forget.
5461980	5462980	Can we take the rap out?
5462980	5463980	Do we do it yet?
5463980	5465980	I just don't want to hear from people telling me that there was
5465980	5467980	something I said that they could get the smell on me,
5467980	5469980	that I was trying too hard in the backyard.
5469980	5471980	I bought the milkshake, put it that lard,
5471980	5473980	and it was all curdled.
5473980	5474980	Yeah.
5474980	5475980	I don't want to be that way.
5475980	5476980	So I think I did it right.
5476980	5478980	But now that I did, that's why I kept rapping tonight.
5478980	5480980	So when I get in the car, I think about the rap.
5480980	5483980	This is the thing that I did that's crap,
5483980	5486980	to make it off balance, to make it strange.
5486980	5487980	It's got to be strange.
5487980	5490980	So tomorrow is a new day, a new direction, a new way.
5490980	5491980	I got to improve.
5491980	5492980	I got to change.
5492980	5493980	I did it too well tonight.
5493980	5494980	That raps my brain.
5494980	5497980	I got to get in the tub and wonder what I can write to tell you.
5497980	5498980	Can you take a couple things out tonight?
5498980	5500980	Because I don't like two legs.
5500980	5501980	I don't like four legs.
5501980	5503980	I don't like even pegs.
5503980	5504980	I like shit missing.
5505980	5507980	That's when my brain goes blissin' out.
5507980	5509980	Ooh, opioid love, uh.
5509980	5511980	Up there in the tub, uh.
5511980	5513980	Holy fuck, John.
5513980	5515980	You just blew our fucking mind.
5515980	5517980	You buried the lead.
5517980	5520980	You fucking rap good.
5520980	5523980	I'm embarrassed that I did it in front of you.
5523980	5525980	You can never come back again.
5528980	5529980	Wow.
5529980	5531980	That was good.
5531980	5534980	Apparently the key is looking up to the right.
5534980	5536980	And like doing this with your fingers?
5536980	5537980	Yeah, he was doing that.
5537980	5538980	That was something.
5538980	5539980	That's all you got to do.
5539980	5540980	Yeah.
5540980	5543980	What were those keys for around his neck?
5543980	5544980	What were those keys for?
5544980	5545980	I don't know.
5545980	5551980	He drives an Uber, so he has to have keys to get in.
5551980	5552980	So much hate.
5552980	5553980	So much hate.
5553980	5555980	They were keys to the bathroom.
5555980	5557980	Keys to the bathroom.
5557980	5558980	In the bathroom.
5562980	5563980	All right.
5563980	5564980	You know what?
5564980	5565980	What I never mentioned.
5565980	5566980	Fucking dick.
5566980	5568980	Pick it up.
5571980	5573980	You should be in the kneecap with a microphone.
5573980	5574980	That does hurt.
5574980	5576980	Children, please.
5576980	5577980	You like that noise, Rob?
5577980	5578980	You like that?
5578980	5579980	Shit!
5579980	5580980	Shit!
5586980	5587980	Shit!
5587980	5588980	What are you doing?
5588980	5589980	What are you doing?
5589980	5590980	What are you doing?
5590980	5591980	What are you doing?
5591980	5592980	He's just getting ice.
5594980	5595980	Sorry.
5595980	5601980	The majority of those clips are at Meltdown, which is now gone.
5601980	5605980	And I think we always knew how special that place was.
5605980	5608980	And of course, when it closed down, we were all able to eulogize it.
5608980	5614980	But the thing, like, I always thought, oh, this is a good place because of the crowd
5614980	5617980	that it draws and the simplicity of all this stuff.
5618980	5624980	Like, we moved out of there and tried to do this show at my stage at Starburns with an
5624980	5625980	audience, without an audience.
5625980	5628980	We tried to do this show in a VO booth.
5628980	5629980	Now we've moved here.
5629980	5631980	This place is great.
5631980	5632980	No disrespect.
5632980	5640980	But the crazy thing is to realize that, oh, Meltdown was more than actually the absence
5640980	5641980	of a bunch of stuff.
5641980	5644980	It was actually, like, inimitable.
5644980	5649980	Like, I always thought of it as, like, oh, if we could just get these pillars out of
5649980	5651980	here, we'd be great.
5651980	5653980	But there was something secret about it.
5653980	5655980	And I don't know what it is.
5655980	5664980	Do you think it was as true, like, natives of that place and founding parents of it?
5664980	5668980	I'll start you off with one thing that people have said over and over again.
5668980	5670980	Was it simple altitude?
5670980	5675980	Is it just that the audience and the performer are, like, down at the same level?
5675980	5676980	I think that's part of it.
5676980	5678980	It always felt like a basement to me.
5678980	5683980	Like, your coolest friend's, like, parents' basement that you got to hang out in and do
5683980	5685980	whatever you wanted in and everybody left you alone.
5685980	5687980	They say low ceilings are important for comedy.
5687980	5688980	Yeah, I think they are.
5688980	5690980	High ceilings are good for music.
5690980	5694980	It just had, like, the opposite of an Indian burial ground.
5694980	5696980	Whatever that is.
5696980	5697980	It's just, yeah.
5697980	5699980	Indian living air.
5699980	5701980	But was that place a fluke?
5701980	5703980	Was that an accidental discovery?
5703980	5709980	Or did someone have to stand in that space and go, this would be perfect for performance?
5709980	5713980	I think Gaston, the owner of Meltdown Comics, always wanted it to be a performance space.
5713980	5718980	But I think he wasn't ever going to put in time to, like, he didn't have the ability
5718980	5720980	to put in time to, like, make it one.
5720980	5723980	So that was kind of, it was kind of loosely, like, random shows were there.
5723980	5726980	And then, yeah, and then we started doing Meltdown there.
5726980	5730980	And then I got hired to, like, do all the other shows there, which is how,
5730980	5734980	which is how Harbin Town, because I was like, I need shows so bad.
5734980	5735980	And there was nothing happening.
5735980	5737980	But it just always felt magical.
5737980	5740980	Yeah, it's like, you know, you say all those things about the high ceilings
5740980	5742980	and that it was a pretty small space.
5742980	5746980	Whatever it is, whatever the physical dimensions of a great comedy theater are,
5746980	5747980	it had that.
5747980	5751980	But it also had, I don't know, the fact that you had to go through a comic book store
5751980	5752980	to get there.
5753980	5757980	You know, it was, as you said, an Indian living air about that place.
5757980	5760980	There was something magical about it, you know?
5760980	5765980	I understood the, that's the thing, is that I understood the comic going through it.
5765980	5767980	I understood the factual information.
5767980	5768980	Oh, it's hip.
5768980	5769980	Yeah.
5769980	5770980	It's the new Largo.
5770980	5772980	It's LA.
5772980	5773980	It's underground.
5773980	5779980	It's, like, understanding that as a matter of fashion, which makes it, like,
5779980	5784980	actually artificial, where you go, like, oh, the reason this is successful
5784980	5788980	is actually because of mass hysteria is actually a disservice.
5788980	5789980	Yeah.
5789980	5792980	Because that room is inimitable.
5792980	5796980	Like, we sit here in this room, for instance, and we, like, try to, like,
5796980	5798980	we're like, goddamn it, now that we're in a different room,
5798980	5800980	how do we get that fucking meltdown sound?
5800980	5801980	And it's crazy.
5801980	5805980	Like, if I were going to record an album, whatever that is anymore,
5805980	5809980	I would be like, can we buy the meltdown space?
5809980	5810980	Like, because what is it?
5810980	5811980	It's mysterious.
5811980	5812980	Yeah, it's mysterious.
5812980	5814980	There's also a whole community around it.
5814980	5817980	I mean, we would see people come to our show and then they would become friends
5817980	5821980	and people, like, met there and got engaged and married and divorced.
5821980	5822980	And, you know, it was...
5822980	5824980	And they went on to work here and went on to work at other places.
5824980	5825980	It felt more appropriate.
5825980	5828980	Like, if you guys got married after tonight, you'd be monsters.
5828980	5831980	Like, why did you marry him?
5831980	5832980	I will say, your audience...
5832980	5836980	Oh, we were sitting next to each other in a fucking auditorium downtown.
5836980	5837980	It'd be like, you monster.
5837980	5840980	You deserved this divorce.
5840980	5841980	I'm kidding.
5841980	5842980	I'm kidding.
5842980	5845980	Your audience has always been the most special of all the audiences,
5845980	5848980	I will say, that Mel Donne ever had.
5848980	5852980	The most, like, literally people saying, bringing in their own chairs,
5852980	5856980	because I told a guy once, will you pay the money for the chair?
5856980	5859980	Like, jokingly, and he brought his own chair the next week.
5859980	5860980	You'd be like, now I get it free.
5860980	5861980	You can guess who that was.
5862980	5866980	And I had no choice but to be like, you have bested me.
5866980	5867980	Please come on in.
5867980	5869980	Does it rhyme with thratum flog?
5869980	5871980	Fl...
5871980	5872980	Flodberg?
5872980	5873980	100%, yeah.
5873980	5874980	Yeah, it does rhyme with that.
5874980	5875980	Yeah.
5876980	5877980	Yeah, I didn't...
5877980	5879980	Sorry, sorry.
5879980	5883980	I knew our audience was special, but I always thought that place was so special.
5883980	5886980	And we'll be fine here, too.
5886980	5889980	But also, it's been 300 episodes, so why not stop, you know?
5889980	5890980	Let's just stop.
5890980	5891980	Just stop.
5891980	5892980	Are you netting this thing right now?
5892980	5893980	Just stop it.
5893980	5894980	Stop it.
5894980	5895980	Oh, bro, are you netting this thing?
5895980	5896980	Stop making the podcast.
5896980	5897980	Stop making it.
5898980	5899980	I'm not fishing for that.
5901980	5903980	Is this the last episode?
5903980	5904980	Could you swear to that?
5904980	5906980	Jesus, you're the one pushing it.
5906980	5908980	I want to see what happens.
5908980	5910980	No, I'm too drunk to make decisions.
5910980	5911980	I...
5911980	5912980	That's fair.
5912980	5913980	I'm just tired.
5913980	5915980	I'm tired of being me.
5915980	5916980	Tired of being famous.
5916980	5919980	Stopping doing the podcast won't stop you from being you.
5919980	5920980	Will it, though?
5920980	5925980	Yeah, no, but I could be me in a dark room where no one can hurt me anymore.
5925980	5926980	Like...
5926980	5927980	You can hurt yourself.
5927980	5930980	Who's the one person who hurts you the most?
5930980	5931980	What?
5931980	5932980	No, I...
5933980	5936980	No one has ever given me more pleasure than myself.
5937980	5940980	Believe me, you lock me in a room with me.
5941980	5944980	I'm gonna experience a lot of pleasure.
5945980	5948980	That's the one thing I know for sure.
5948980	5949980	There will be no pain.
5949980	5953980	You come back in a year and there will be, like, a lot of blogs on the wall and...
5954980	5956980	It won't be written in ink.
5958980	5959980	Anyways...
5960980	5962980	I can use some Ziploc bags if you need them.
5962980	5963980	What else is on the docket?
5963980	5964980	Look, wait, wait.
5964980	5965980	We didn't even...
5965980	5967980	Like, if I was a Martian and I was listening to the podcast, I was like,
5967980	5968980	oh, who's Kumail and Emily?
5968980	5969980	Who the fuck are you guys?
5969980	5970980	Like, last...
5970980	5973980	We bid you guys kind of farewell.
5973980	5979980	There was never an official thing, but, like, our ships drifted apart.
5979980	5982980	We haven't spoken to you guys.
5982980	5984980	What has changed about life?
5984980	5986980	Like, is there anything to...
5986980	5989980	We got some fake grass in our lawn instead of real grass.
5989980	5990980	Did you guys move?
5990980	5991980	You got a nice house?
5991980	5992980	Yeah, a nice house.
5992980	5996980	Are you still living in the same place as when you were non-Oscar nominated?
5996980	5998980	Yeah, well, when you get nominated, you get a house.
5998980	5999980	They instantly give you a new house.
5999980	6002980	Your Oscar nomination doesn't come with a deed to a new house.
6002980	6005980	Yeah, and they take it away from someone.
6005980	6007980	Just a normal person.
6007980	6010980	It's actually all the nominees of your category move into the same house,
6010980	6011980	and the winner gets to keep it.
6011980	6012980	That's unfortunate.
6012980	6014980	So we got to live there and Jordan's there now.
6014980	6016980	Yeah, we call it our house.
6016980	6017980	I mean, yeah.
6017980	6018980	No, we're in the same place.
6018980	6019980	We're in the same place, yeah.
6019980	6020980	All right.
6020980	6026980	In terms of career, both as actors, writers, like, so...
6026980	6030980	Like, to the extent that you can remember, so imagine this path
6030980	6034980	before the big sick, and now then the big sick is this big black box
6034980	6038980	that's like, we can't analyze that, but imagine that as a black box
6038980	6040980	for the purpose of the equation.
6040980	6045980	So can you compare, like, what has, like, really empirically shifted?
6045980	6046980	Everything.
6046980	6048980	It's very different.
6048980	6049980	Good and bad.
6049980	6050980	Sure, but mostly good.
6050980	6052980	Yeah, more good than bad, yeah.
6052980	6055980	We get to choose what we want to work on rather than being like,
6055980	6058980	oh, it'd be cool if we got this job, either one of us.
6058980	6060980	People think we know what we're doing, so...
6060980	6061980	Oh, my God, that's the best part.
6061980	6062980	Very scary.
6062980	6063980	Yeah.
6063980	6064980	Very scary.
6064980	6068980	The thing that's mostly is that, like, it's because the...
6068980	6070980	Obviously, the agents, like, are able to now...
6070980	6072980	It's like, they're able to...
6072980	6074980	People are able to say, can I meet with them?
6074980	6075980	And the answer is yes.
6075980	6077980	And, like, you get to, like, have these meetings
6077980	6079980	that you never thought you'd have.
6079980	6082980	And so it's mostly positive, right?
6082980	6083980	Yeah.
6083980	6086980	Well, the greatest thing really is the thing that we've wanted to do
6086980	6089980	for years and years and years, we...
6089980	6091980	For a little brief window right now,
6091980	6093980	we're in a position where we can do them.
6093980	6094980	Right.
6094980	6096980	It can go away very quickly.
6096980	6097980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6097980	6098980	Like, if I...
6098980	6099980	If, like, my next...
6099980	6101980	The next movie, I mean, if it comes out, it doesn't do well,
6101980	6102980	it could go away right then.
6102980	6104980	You see it all the time.
6104980	6106980	So we're trying to...
6106980	6108980	Well, we're very aware of that.
6108980	6109980	It's a little bit scary.
6109980	6112980	Yeah, that raise your anxiety,
6112980	6114980	which is a terrible thing to happen to you
6114980	6118980	that wouldn't have been the case before you hit the moon with a steam shot.
6118980	6121980	Well, because now it's like the expectations are high.
6121980	6122980	I mean, I'm sure you're aware of this.
6122980	6124980	And so everybody keeps telling us,
6124980	6126980	don't write your second thing, write your third thing.
6126980	6127980	Right.
6127980	6128980	Like, don't skip past it.
6128980	6129980	Well, first of all, I've actually never heard that,
6129980	6131980	and that, like, that's fucking...
6131980	6132980	That's great, right?
6132980	6134980	That sounds awful.
6134980	6137980	And accurate and, like, horrifying.
6137980	6138980	Yeah.
6138980	6139980	That sounds awful.
6139980	6140980	Because there's so much pressure on you to, like, recreate.
6140980	6141980	What does that mean?
6141980	6142980	I don't quite understand that.
6142980	6143980	Just the second thing,
6143980	6145980	just because you put so much pressure on yourself,
6145980	6146980	what are you going to write next?
6146980	6148980	Everybody's like, oh, my God, what will you guys be doing next?
6148980	6149980	They're like, skip it.
6149980	6150980	Just go to the next thing.
6150980	6151980	We would literally be doing press...
6151980	6153980	But everyone else knows this is your second thing.
6153980	6154980	Yeah.
6154980	6155980	It's not as good.
6155980	6156980	No.
6156980	6157980	We would be doing press for...
6157980	6159980	This idea that there would be pressure on you,
6159980	6161980	that you would go, say you loved Poodles,
6161980	6163980	and you're like, and then you made The Big Sick,
6163980	6164980	and then you're like,
6164980	6166980	The Big Sick made everybody like,
6166980	6169980	J.J. Abrams wants to meet with you,
6169980	6170980	and then you're like,
6170980	6172980	I'm going to pitch him the Poodle movie,
6172980	6177980	or do we, like, pitch him a fucking Star Trek Poodle thing?
6177980	6180980	Or like, you have an anxiety that didn't exist
6180980	6182980	when you were just like,
6182980	6184980	I'll fucking do anything I want.
6184980	6186980	There's a fear when you actually get the freedom
6186980	6187980	to do whatever you want of like,
6187980	6189980	oh, shit, now I have to do whatever I want.
6189980	6190980	Now I have to bet right.
6190980	6191980	Yeah, now I have to.
6191980	6192980	Or the house wins.
6192980	6193980	Yes, exactly.
6193980	6194980	That's exactly right.
6194980	6195980	That is definitely it.
6195980	6198980	We've done a good job of only doing what we...
6198980	6200980	so that what we want to do has not changed
6200980	6202980	and where we've been able to do that.
6202980	6204980	We haven't like...
6204980	6205980	What do you say?
6205980	6207980	Like the stuff that we like before our movie
6207980	6209980	that we were like, we want to make stuff like this.
6209980	6210980	Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6210980	6211980	Is the kind of stuff that...
6211980	6212980	That's the stuff that we're both doing
6212980	6213980	individually and together.
6213980	6214980	So it's like, that part's good,
6214980	6215980	but then it's also like,
6215980	6217980	when you get the freedom to do whatever,
6217980	6218980	there's like a certain terror
6218980	6220980	in the freedom to do whatever.
6220980	6222980	Here's my most sensitive, crazy question,
6222980	6223980	because I don't even...
6223980	6227980	Like, you guys are life partners and writing partners.
6227980	6229980	What does that do to a relationship?
6229980	6231980	Like, to be under...
6231980	6233980	It makes you take all your clothes off
6233980	6234980	when you take a shit.
6234980	6236980	Yeah, and I put all of his clothes on
6236980	6237980	when I take a shit.
6237980	6239980	So that's what's changed.
6239980	6241980	You guys have been very candid,
6241980	6242980	so I would have sounded like,
6242980	6246980	have you had fights that have been brought on by...?
6246980	6247980	Monstrous fights, absolutely.
6247980	6249980	Yeah, absolutely.
6249980	6250980	You don't have to share them,
6250980	6252980	because I think that's cheap.
6252980	6254980	Well, we live in too gossipy a world, so...
6254980	6256980	Well, it's not gossipy, so...
6256980	6258980	We have had fights, because the thing is,
6258980	6260980	if you have a fight with a co-worker,
6260980	6262980	there's a ceiling to where that fight can go.
6262980	6263980	Yep.
6263980	6264980	But if you're having a fight with a co-worker
6264980	6266980	who's also the person you're in love with,
6266980	6268980	the ceiling is much higher.
6268980	6269980	So you can start on a fight...
6269980	6270980	Or lower, really.
6270980	6271980	The basement's much lower.
6271980	6272980	Yes, the basement's lower.
6272980	6274980	So you're starting on, like,
6274980	6276980	hey, I disagree, it should be like this.
6276980	6278980	With a co-worker, you're like,
6278980	6282980	it can't really get as personal as it can with this.
6282980	6284980	So we really had to have rules.
6284980	6287980	We had to figure out how to be able to write together.
6287980	6289980	I think if you shared a couple of those,
6289980	6291980	it would be valuable, first of all, to me.
6291980	6293980	I have a girlfriend who's a writer.
6293980	6294980	Very talented writer.
6294980	6296980	We get by okay.
6296980	6297980	It's fucking ho...
6297980	6300980	It's a challenge to approach the area.
6300980	6301980	Yeah.
6301980	6302980	Because...
6302980	6303980	And we're not partners.
6303980	6305980	We don't work on stuff together.
6305980	6308980	So if you guys figured out how to not kill each other...
6308980	6310980	We just have a couple rules of, like, you can't...
6310980	6312980	You have to find the specific...
6312980	6314980	We literally book time to work with each other,
6314980	6316980	rather than assuming that the other person's available.
6316980	6317980	I think that's a big one.
6317980	6318980	You have to have those lines,
6318980	6320980	otherwise just hanging out at home can be worse.
6320980	6323980	So to be clear about that, if you guys are like,
6323980	6326980	hey, as lovers, let's go stay at this hotel
6326980	6329980	and have piña coladas if Kumail's like,
6329980	6330980	hmm, that's a good piña colada.
6330980	6332980	I think the protagonist should...
6332980	6335980	Emily's like, knock it off, fuck face.
6335980	6336980	No, thank you, yeah.
6336980	6338980	Literally in the shower before you came here,
6338980	6340980	you were like, can I ask you a word question?
6340980	6341980	And I said no.
6341980	6344980	Hey, I'm in here taking a shit, I'm not showering.
6344980	6348980	I can understand your confusion, I'm naked.
6348980	6352980	Let's turn the air conditioner off on the right over to the thing.
6352980	6353980	In the bathroom.
6353980	6356980	Well, we have specific work times,
6356980	6359980	and then, as you said, if we're, like, just hanging out,
6359980	6360980	we have to get the other person's...
6360980	6363980	If I was like, if she thinks of something for the movie
6363980	6364980	or whatever we're working on,
6364980	6367980	she has to be like, hey, can we switch gears?
6367980	6369980	And the other person has to give you permission.
6369980	6372980	And that makes a huge difference.
6372980	6375980	Is there a safe word to get out?
6375980	6377980	No, that's actually probably a good idea.
6377980	6378980	That's a real question.
6378980	6381980	Like, it would be like, look, fucking too much.
6381980	6382980	Ruining the honeymoon.
6382980	6383980	Yeah, and don't do it in bed.
6383980	6384980	No talking about work stuff in bed.
6384980	6385980	That's a big one.
6385980	6386980	That's true.
6386980	6387980	Yeah.
6387980	6388980	And yeah.
6388980	6389980	And we also don't...
6389980	6392980	Like, the way we write together is when we're breaking a story
6392980	6393980	or something, we're together,
6393980	6397980	but then we don't actually write in the same room.
6397980	6398980	That would destroy...
6398980	6401980	We know drafts back and forth.
6401980	6403980	But you know, it's really...
6403980	6404980	It's great.
6404980	6407980	So we're working on something right now together.
6407980	6409980	And it's really exciting because we'll talk about it.
6409980	6411980	And then later in the day, I'm like,
6411980	6413980	I only started that one thing.
6413980	6415980	I don't think anybody in the world but her could have thought of that.
6415980	6417980	And it's really exciting.
6417980	6419980	And it's also like she'll write something
6419980	6422980	and I'll be the first person in the world to read it.
6422980	6423980	And that's very exciting.
6423980	6426980	It's like I get to look inside her brain.
6426980	6428980	So the positive is far off the way.
6428980	6429980	It's so sweet.
6429980	6430980	I can't even handle that.
6430980	6431980	It's so sweet.
6431980	6433980	No, you don't have to clap for it.
6433980	6435980	I'm just saying, like, it is very sweet.
6435980	6437980	And I feel the same way about you.
6437980	6440980	And I think that part of it is starting with that respect of like,
6440980	6442980	oh, I really like what he does
6442980	6445980	and what a cool thing that I get to have access to it before anybody else.
6445980	6447980	And you have to kind of start on that foot of like,
6447980	6449980	I'm a big fan of this person.
6449980	6451980	Because if not, if you're coming at it from like,
6451980	6453980	how can I fix what they've done, then you're already losing.
6453980	6454980	Right.
6454980	6455980	Yeah.
6455980	6457980	I am never going to find love.
6460980	6462980	Well, you don't have to start there.
6462980	6463980	You don't have to start here.
6463980	6467980	You can just be at Rite Aid and be like,
6467980	6470980	she shares my interest in these knit socks.
6470980	6472980	I think you're the best boyfriend.
6472980	6473980	I've thought about this.
6473980	6475980	I thought you were the best boyfriend.
6475980	6476980	You've thought about this.
6476980	6478980	I have.
6478980	6481980	Did you think about it in the bathroom?
6481980	6484980	Can't you see it in her drafts?
6484980	6485980	Yeah.
6485980	6488980	Why is everyone named Steve A.G.?
6490980	6492980	I do think that's amazing.
6492980	6494980	I don't want to lose that, if only for myself,
6494980	6497980	just that idea because you know how magnets,
6497980	6498980	like they have fields,
6498980	6501980	so like they can propel each other as easily as they can.
6501980	6503980	Like magnets are out of fucking control.
6503980	6505980	They get in the presence of each other
6505980	6507980	and they do shit beyond your control.
6507980	6510980	I'm not being insane clown posse.
6511980	6514980	I also don't understand magnets,
6514980	6516980	but I'm not pretending I do,
6516980	6521980	but it's like because Cody and I aren't writing partners.
6521980	6523980	We don't write together,
6523980	6526980	but she's the first writer I've ever been with.
6526980	6531980	And like when the truth is like for her to say,
6531980	6533980	hey, would you read my script?
6533980	6538980	Like it sends fucking spasms of panic through me.
6538980	6539980	Really?
6539980	6542980	Yes, because what you guys have achieved is you're like,
6542980	6544980	oh, I'm a big fan and all this stuff.
6544980	6547980	Well, you've worked together and done this stuff.
6547980	6553980	And it's like, I freak out because I'm like,
6553980	6555980	what if I fuck up?
6555980	6557980	What if you fuck up while reading her stuff?
6557980	6561980	Well, what if anything about this perfect stasis?
6561980	6563980	You're like, what if I don't like it?
6563980	6567980	It's like you guys, to put it in Star Wars terms,
6567980	6571980	what you guys are kind of describing to me is like,
6571980	6575980	hey, we're Luke and Han,
6575980	6578980	but people change roles.
6578980	6580980	And then I'm like,
6580980	6584980	but if you see a writer from across a bar
6584980	6586980	and then you start talking and then you start dating
6586980	6588980	and then you hook up and you're in a relationship with a writer,
6588980	6590980	it's like you're Han and Han.
6590980	6593980	And who's going to shoot first?
6593980	6596980	Like, like, like, like, like, like, like Han.
6596980	6599980	Clearly Han.
6599980	6601980	You don't, you don't want to fuck with that.
6601980	6603980	Yeah, baby.
6603980	6605980	Oh, she just wants another drink.
6605980	6610980	Cody, Cody Heller, everybody.
6610980	6612980	Cody, have a seat.
6612980	6614980	No, no, no.
6614980	6617980	I'm really just going to remind you to shut the fuck up.
6617980	6618980	I'm listening.
6618980	6622980	I'm listening from back there.
6622980	6628980	But yeah, it is work.
6628980	6633980	I'm not saying that this, the way that we work together is,
6633980	6635980	it's still work.
6635980	6637980	You have to sort of figure out and there's still bumps.
6637980	6641980	We both think we're alpha still.
6641980	6643980	That's not, like, that doesn't go away.
6643980	6645980	You just have to kind of like realize like, oh,
6645980	6647980	maybe sometimes there's two alphas or two betas.
6647980	6649980	Like, it doesn't go away.
6649980	6650980	I have achieved that.
6650980	6653980	I have achieved that with Rob a little bit.
6653980	6657980	Like, like, like when we write together.
6657980	6660980	Like, like Rob and I have written stuff together for 20 years and then
6660980	6662980	like Justin, Rick and Morty.
6662980	6666980	Like, you find partnerships with people where you're like, okay,
6666980	6668980	this works.
6668980	6670980	And it doesn't always work.
6670980	6674980	But I just, you're talking about like,
6674980	6678980	when you think about the math of it, like the, the,
6678980	6680980	the math of it, like, the math of it.
6680980	6682980	And then you're like, oh,
6682980	6684980	I'm like, oh,
6684980	6686980	I get together on Wednesdays and I write with my friend and we're
6686980	6689980	trying to write a screenplay together and they're my writing partner.
6689980	6692980	Take the difficulty, the challenge of that relationship.
6692980	6694980	Multiply times.
6694980	6697980	Oh, unrelated to anything that I do.
6697980	6699980	Like, oh, I'm dating this person.
6699980	6700980	I'm trying to make that work.
6700980	6702980	And then you multiply those two things.
6702980	6704980	That's why I'm like, what?
6704980	6705980	How are you guys?
6705980	6707980	How do we get together and not write together?
6707980	6709980	Because writing is a sort of a very personal thing.
6709980	6710980	Very vulnerable.
6710980	6711980	Yeah.
6711980	6712980	Very vulnerable thing.
6712980	6714980	So we sort of, you know, with Meltdown,
6714980	6717980	I was performing and she was producing the show and then we
6717980	6718980	hosted a podcast together.
6718980	6723980	So we slowly worked up to figuring out how to write
6723980	6724980	together because that is.
6724980	6726980	You guys had a precedent of not punishing each other for
6726980	6728980	vulnerability, things like that.
6728980	6729980	I think that's important.
6729980	6731980	Or at least forgiving each other for doing that.
6731980	6734980	As a, as a mental health professional, maybe not to.
6734980	6735980	There you go.
6735980	6736980	I don't think that hurts.
6736980	6737980	No.
6737980	6740980	If you're going to write with a lover, find a shrink.
6740980	6741980	Maybe it's the lesson.
6741980	6742980	No.
6742980	6743980	All right.
6743980	6745980	Well, thank you for answering that stuff, frankly.
6745980	6748980	Well, the other thing that's great is that we do,
6748980	6750980	we're very similar in the things we like,
6750980	6753980	I think for different reasons.
6753980	6755980	And so we're able to write together because we have the
6755980	6761980	same aesthetic, the same taste, but we sort of focus on
6761980	6762980	different things of it.
6762980	6765980	So we kind of have different strengths that work well
6765980	6766980	together.
6766980	6768980	Is one of you the better dialogue or story person or is
6768980	6770980	it like, or are you kind of both equally strong there or
6770980	6772980	like, do you guys kind of share roles?
6772980	6774980	Well, Emily is very good at character stuff because
6774980	6775980	she's a therapist.
6775980	6778980	And tell him about your thing about how you sort of,
6778980	6780980	well, when you're like,
6780980	6782980	Therapizing someone, you're, you're, you're,
6782980	6784980	you're telling about how you accidentally caught that
6784980	6787980	murderer while we were writing that Nash Bridges spec.
6787980	6788980	Yeah.
6788980	6790980	I mean, we both have, and he's also very good at that too.
6790980	6793980	Like, and yeah, we both have, we're both kind of good at
6793980	6794980	the same stuff.
6794980	6796980	I would say we don't need to like get ready.
6796980	6797980	Yeah.
6797980	6798980	We're both good at the same stuff.
6798980	6799980	I would say.
6799980	6800980	Yeah.
6800980	6801980	It's awesome.
6801980	6802980	Yeah.
6802980	6803980	I watched your movie way too late,
6803980	6804980	but I watched it on a plane and it was like,
6804980	6805980	I thought I just adored it.
6805980	6806980	I love it so much.
6806980	6807980	Oh, thank you.
6807980	6808980	Yeah.
6808980	6811980	Were you wearing underwear?
6811980	6812980	Fuck.
6812980	6813980	Yeah.
6813980	6814980	Me undies, baby.
6814980	6816980	Me undies all the way.
6816980	6818980	It kind of reminds me.
6818980	6819980	Yeah.
6819980	6821980	Dan, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to jump in here because
6821980	6823980	you guys are talking about being a married couple and we're,
6823980	6825980	we're all, we're all kind of a unit.
6825980	6826980	We're all kind of a family.
6826980	6831980	Can we play the family rap and MC John?
6831980	6833980	And thank you so much for listening to shows.
6833980	6836980	I don't know how many you all have listened to, but thank you for,
6836980	6838980	thank you for putting up with our nonsense.
6838980	6842980	Let's, let's play a family MC John rap and then let's fuck off
6842980	6843980	into the night.
6844980	6849980	When you move, move, move your body to the beat.
6852980	6857980	When you see, see, see everybody in the street.
6861980	6863980	You got the action.
6863980	6865980	I got the water.
6865980	6869980	We'll put them both in a cup with our daughter,
6869980	6875980	family, family on the street with a bucket and a cup.
6875980	6876980	Doing everything.
6876980	6882980	What's up, family, family on the street tonight with a bucket
6882980	6883980	and a cup.
6883980	6885980	What's up, bucket, bucket.
6885980	6886980	Yo, yo, yo.
6886980	6888980	My name is MC John.
6888980	6890980	I'm here to mow the lawn.
6890980	6893980	I'd like to use a rake, but that grass will not take.
6893980	6896980	I got to get up on the riding mower.
6896980	6897980	Go faster.
6897980	6898980	Don't go slower.
6898980	6900980	Mow around the trees and yard.
6900980	6902980	I fucked your mama hard.
6902980	6906980	I want to see you next big day night.
6910980	6915980	I don't want to get into a fight.
6915980	6918980	Yeah, don't get in a fight baby.
6918980	6923980	Cause you are my family and I love you.
6923980	6926980	So you what?
6927980	6932980	I won't steal your socks or your shoes.
6932980	6934980	Family.
6934980	6938980	Cause you got what I need.
6943980	6944980	Family.
6947980	6950980	Thank you for coming to Harman's Town, everybody.
6950980	6960980	Give it up for Rob Schwab, Steve Agee, Brandon Johnson,

7360980	7361980	Number five.
7361980	7362980	Number five.
7362980	7369980	Guy walks into a shoe store with a bottle of champagne and his cock hanging out of his
7369980	7370980	pants.
7370980	7377980	The shoe woman says, can I help you, sir?
7377980	7382980	And he says, what do you have in an 11 and a half?
7382980	7384980	She takes him in back.
7384980	7392980	There's a sheep there wearing beautiful pair of Ruby slippers on its front hooves and these
7392980	7398980	amazing Air Jordan cross trainers on its rear hooves.
7398980	7404980	But it's got this gaping mouth for a butthole.
7404980	7412980	A human mouth with teeth and lipstick and a tongue.
7413980	7416980	She says, have at it and goes back to the front of the store.
7416980	7420980	He's left holding the champagne and his cock.
7420980	7422980	She's sweeping up later.
7422980	7429980	He comes out with an empty bottle and no cock.
7429980	7433980	She says, did you enjoy the 11 and a half?
7433980	7438980	He says, at these prices, I'm going to need more champagne.
7438980	7443980	Now, we'll be back with joke number four.
7443980	7447980	What do you call a shoe with no sole?
7447980	7450980	The top of a sock.
7455980	7458980	That was a little more cerebral than number five.
7458980	7460980	He's going to keep it moving.
7460980	7463980	He's making us think.
7468980	7497980	Why did the Asian shoe in a racist society go to the horses stable when he felt
7497980	7500980	untied?
7500980	7506980	He wanted to find the laces.
7506980	7508980	He was looking for the laces.
7508980	7510980	This is a racist society.
7510980	7513980	Here comes Dan Armin.

7535980	7537980	It has to top the converse joke.
7537980	7542980	The converse joke is a fucking 24 carat goddamn piece of genius.
7542980	7546980	All he has to do is tell one more joke.
