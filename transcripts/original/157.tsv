321040	327760	days, you're already that street? Yeah, the city invented streets, bitch, I keep wanting to say the
327760	332640	n-word, like to be authentic, like, just fucking do it, what's the worst thing that can happen? Yeah,
332640	338720	who could be listening and who could ever profit from such a thing? Who would ever want to humiliate
338720	346560	me or make me seem like a bad person? There's no way to dip a paddle in that stream, I've never,
346560	350720	I can't even conceive of it, little old me. You don't work for Sony anymore, NBC, you're a
350720	356960	freestyler, man. Yeah, I'm a free fucking, like, yeah, antenna for horrible clickbait. Drop a
356960	363280	couple end bombs, man, use this beautiful moment in time to just spread your wings and just be
363280	368800	really racist. I feel like you'd love it if I did that and I feel like you're a bad person,
369520	380000	but we're Goi, so. Would you call me? Hello, New York, welcome. That was all the cold open of the
380000	391840	show. We're here at the, we're here at the, we're in the East Village. Yeah, in the prestigious
391840	402320	heroin district. Yeah, I walked around here and I look at the bricks and I really understand
402320	407520	everything about the city. Could you live here, Dan? Let's say work took you here and you had to
407520	415440	work on a show for two years. Could you enjoy living in the city here? Yeah, I could. I don't
415440	421520	think I would be functional. Like I, I get lost in LA and I, and I've lived there for forever. I
421520	426480	got lost in Milwaukee before that. And I just, I, I don't, I, everything. I don't want to give myself
426480	430240	excuses, but I believe I don't have a sense of direction. You're not supposed to define yourself
430240	434240	by your limitations. You're not supposed to say I'm bad at math. You're supposed to, supposed to
434240	442400	open a textbook and word. It's just another, but I just, I feel like I breathe that New York air
442480	447360	and I just want to fucking like, say it. I want to put a fucking flourish on this shit. It's like,
447360	453920	and you know, I don't mean a dehumanized black person when I say it. It's like, I mean, you
453920	460480	and you and, and the statue of Liberty and the, and the, and the pretzel maker.
462000	468560	You're one of your New York salty pretzel makers and your, and your, and your water that you have
468560	473280	flown in from Chicago. So your pizza could taste right. I don't know what to do. You're, you're,
473280	476560	you're, you're, you're, you're, oh, and you're, someone said, no.
479040	483120	You're, you're, you're bridge, you're bridges and tunnels and the crowds that come through them and
483760	488480	and across them and how wonderful they all are. What a, what a great city. Are you, you're kind
488480	494640	of a little bit xenophobic. You're not crazy about the outside world. Well, I liked Hercules better.
498560	513520	Comedy show. I got some, I got some jokes. I can float. If you say Zeno. No, I think a Zeno. No.
516320	521280	That was great. That was like, we were like Nichols and may or pickles and pickles and puberty.
522720	525600	We were just like pickles and puberty. Oh, they were great. They were, they were,
525600	530080	they were, they were the first, there used to be two center squares in Hollywood squares and pickles
530080	536480	and puberty. Uh, but that's when pickles died syphilis, they, uh, they, they, they, they changed
536480	542560	it. This is one square now. How could there be two center squares? It was, uh, it was like
542560	546640	geometrically, how does that lay out? It doesn't, because it was, it was radio. There was no TV yet.
546640	552800	So you just, it was the idea that there was two Hollywood squares was an idea. It was on radio
552800	557840	first. Yeah. It was like a terrible pitch. We have a, we have a, we have a clip, uh, of, of that
557840	564320	right now. Do we really? Yeah. Uh, the old, the old original 1927 recording of the, of the, of the,
564320	571760	of the, uh, Hollywood squares episode. Come, come, come there.
571760	574960	Come, come, come.
581760	587680	The first question is to Thomas Edison.
590880	598560	What, uh, what, what, uh, Jack and Jill went up the hill, but Jack got a blank job
598560	610400	from Jill. Thomas Edison. Ah, blow, blow job. Whoa. That's not what we expected.
611920	618960	Well, I'm Thomas Edison, motherfucker. I, my business is, uh, uh, things you didn't expect.
618960	623600	It's called inventions. Look it up. Bleeper. Oh my God. He said it.
623920	631680	Um, Thomas Edison said the N word. He invented the N word on the radio version of Hollywood
631680	639600	squares, but he meant it hatefully. He, he, he, he, he called Tesla. He's like, Tesla, you fucking.
639600	650240	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, like at the world fair in 1921, uh, Tesla, Tesla unveiled alternating
650240	655920	current and Edison was like, this should be direct. You're a fucking electrical. He called him a,
658160	662320	yeah. He said, he looked at the stuff and he was like, this is, this is blank rigged,
662320	667120	you know? Like, wait, what are you doing? You can't electrocute an elephant with this.
670640	675600	Thomas Edison loved electrocuting elephants. Dan, now that you're quoting historical,
676560	681760	you can attribute it to history. Like Obama said it on Zach Galifianakis' show.
681760	688560	You're allowed to cook Edison calling. He's so racist. He thinks Zach Galifianakis looks like
688560	699360	Mark Maron. That is, that is the super racist. You're all, you're all the way back to not racist.
699360	705280	I think all podcasters are Greek. Uh, anyways, we're here in the East village. It's famous
705280	712560	for its, uh, pot pies and it's, uh, sidewalk, uh, uh, pieces. And, uh, it's, uh, the, the, the,
712560	721360	the fire hydrant, uh, uh, that, uh, was used to put out the original New York fire, uh, of, uh,
721360	727920	1830. I'm back there with Wikipedia. I know it's, uh, the, the New York had the first fire.
727920	732160	How did that fire start? It was, uh, it was a, there was a monkey, uh,
733120	738720	that back, back then it was legal to own them as pets and, uh, and like people would bring them and
738720	745680	they would just like the, the, uh, Ellis Island was actually like originally called, uh, yeah,
746960	750560	because it was overrun. Like they were like cats. Like you ever go to like, uh,
750560	758960	like a restaurant in Miami, like that many, uh, that many cats, like, like, like they were,
758960	764720	they were, they were the cats of their time. That many monkeys? It was a Miami cat level.
766160	771920	People didn't know how to spay or neuter them, but we didn't know where to start there. Like,
771920	775840	like, because, uh, we would look at that, look for their privates and we would just see like,
775840	781680	uh, monkey things. And we didn't know, we didn't know we could find, we could find a dog penis and
781680	789520	a cat penis, but we looked at monkeys. There was a problem. Um, because I don't know why it seems
789520	792560	like that would be the opposite. It would be the case. You'd think you would go, I know exactly
792560	796080	where to look and I know what I'm looking for. I think that's why. Cause we were looking for
796080	801760	something that looked like a human penis, but monkified. And, and, and, and instead we saw,
801760	806800	you know, what a monkey penis looks like. It's a, it's a gnarled little, uh, it looks like a claw,
807360	813040	uh, like our, it looks like a raptor claw. So how did the fire start? It's made, it's, it's
818320	824160	monkey penises are covered with, uh, uh, a cut Kaiten. I think you pronounce it like, uh, like a
824160	829760	mollusk shell or a, or a, or a, or a rhino horn. They're, they're very compacted and, and, and,
829760	833760	and like they're hard as glass. They have the texture of glass. Um, and they're, and they're,
833840	838640	and they're, and they're, they're like white and, and like they, and they curve and taper to a very
838640	844320	sharp point. And so we thought that was like a fin or a, or a knife. And we,
845280	850080	so for a long time, you couldn't, you couldn't swing a cat ironically in New York
851440	857360	without hitting a monkey. And so it was one of them. That was the fire. It was,
857360	861440	it was a politically, it was blown out of proportion because there was an anti monkey
861440	865760	sentiment in New York. Was this Tammany Hall? I got it back in the old days. It was how old the
865760	872080	boss Tweed, yeah, was mayor of New York. And, uh, he, yeah, his, his, his, they called him,
872800	878720	yeah, they called him the sugar boys. The, there's political cartoons where it's boss Tweed has got
878720	883440	a sash that says mayor, but then he's in front of a trough that says, uh, Israel and, uh,
883440	891040	and, uh, and then there's just, there's sugar, but the bags of sugar for some reason,
892800	897120	he was in late with the monkeys boss Tweed was. Well, he, yeah, because they, because he was,
897120	901760	it was all like, like, if you, if, if, if, if, if, if monkeys like, uh, were, were around,
901760	905200	then the, the, they, they shit everywhere. And then it was like all the municipal, like, like,
905200	909760	like, like, like back then municipal government was just like, so it was just, it was just your
909760	916080	standard monkey, um, grift. It was just, uh, it was someone's gotta clean this up. And I was like,
916080	921920	oh, uh, I'll do it. And it's fucking boss Tweed in a costume. I was like, I got it. Oh,
921920	926800	this is hard. I should have overtime. You can have it. Cause there was no, all of this was
926800	932720	happening on the radio. So no one could see the, it's the same guy, but how, and if you said stuff,
932720	937280	like this is literally the same guy, they'd go, what are you an anarchist? Are you like Sacco and
937280	942000	Vanzetti or let's go, you know, you could get exterminated for saying that stuff back then.
942000	943040	So how did the fire start?
945760	951920	The, the, the legend is a legend or is it news? I mean, like, that's the thing is that it was all
951920	960560	the truth is a great New York fire of 1921 or three. What was it? The 18, 18, 18. The, the,
961040	969360	the truth is the absolute truth is, or that was before Miami. I looked it up on Snopes. The truth,
969360	976000	the actual fact is it was, uh, it was, uh, it was, uh, it was native Americans started the fire.
978160	983360	That's not a popular thing to say in 18. Like, like, like,
984080	990080	you, you, you, there were native still native American, like, um, uh, cab drivers and like, uh,
991120	992880	um, like,
992880	997760	even back in 18, 18. Yeah. Well, Manhattan is a, is a native American word. That means
997760	1003440	means city of, of the Indians. Like, it's, it was there, but they, they, we discovered Manhattan.
1003440	1008960	It was like, it's like the emerald city for them was now we fucking killed them. I don't care.
1008960	1016480	I don't, I don't, who I do care about them. I, I, I can't, I'm saying I don't care. Yo. Yeah. Yeah.
1016480	1025040	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How could we do to them? How could we have been back then? We were the
1025040	1030080	savages. We were the monsters. Red skin, white skin. What's the difference? When you put a bullet
1030080	1035280	down, you're going to get some Gibbons. They're like monkeys that come from Alaska. You put them
1035280	1041680	in a boat. Don't ask me what to do about that. What have you noticed? I've gotten really bad at
1041680	1048720	rap in the last five episodes of podcast. New York used to have more cats. Rap, tap, rap, a tap,
1048720	1057760	tap, tap. Yo, yo. Okay. Come on. Let's, let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop fucking around.
1058560	1061680	This whole thing is like, like, there's people here that haven't seen the show and they're like,
1061680	1066240	this is the show. No, it's not the show. What happened to your rap? My show is an examination
1066240	1074000	of Dan. Dan, Dan, I'm sorry to interrupt. Why is your rap suffering lately? You used to be so good
1074000	1088640	at it. Don't, don't give me Jack Benny arms. Don't Rochester me. Um, the, the, I will tell you the
1089120	1094000	I will tell you the truth. And I could tell you from your shirt, from what you, your sarcasm that,
1094000	1097600	that you won't agree with this and that you'll probably be amused by it. But I'm telling you
1097600	1101520	the honest truth of my theory to answer your honest question. What is our show if not dealing
1101520	1106320	the honest truth? My actual honest answer to your question for which I will be punished.
1107280	1114720	Not by me. Well, I, I don't think so. Because you, you, you were sarcastic. You've, you've,
1114800	1120000	there's a bubble of insincerity around you. There's a bubble of, of sincerity around me.
1120000	1124800	I will, I'm going to tell you the honest answer. Why is your rap suffering? The honest answer is
1124800	1129920	because I feel too confident and comfortable doing it because I've done too many great raps.
1131680	1138080	See? And there's no, there's nothing, there's no, there's no anxiousness.
1138240	1139120	Is there a client here?
1140960	1146560	It's an art form from the, from the streets. The streets are an anxious, nervous place. Like,
1146560	1152240	like you have to be feral and, and skittish to, to, to, to rap really well. You have to feel like
1152240	1157040	if this rap doesn't work, I might not have supper tonight. I have to rap for my supper.
1157040	1162320	I don't have to rap for my supper. I can walk in here, lay a shit beat down. Not, not that,
1162320	1166560	that beats that shit. Whoever, whoever, whoever made that for free, the please don't.
1166560	1171440	That was by Joey Woodward. I, I can, I can drop the opposite of science. I can drop a,
1171440	1178720	I can drop social studies. Are you saying that? I can drop gym. I don't have to drop mad. I don't
1178720	1184400	have to drop mad science anymore. I can drop happy gym. The opposite of mad science. You're
1184400	1188560	saying you're so comfortable with rap that you're not good anymore at it? Like you, you've become
1188560	1193680	too complacent? It's just, it's, it's, it's, yes, yes, yes. How do we shake you out of that
1193680	1198880	complacency and get you back into that raw feral mode? Well, not by telling me I'm bad at it. I
1198880	1205360	didn't tell you. You said backstage that you're like, I, I, you told me backstage, I, I, I, I've
1205360	1209600	lost my, my, my mojo with the rapping. I just, I think we don't, you think we've rapped too much
1209600	1214800	already? Like, like, I just, if you just play, I'll just try as an experiment, just play a really,
1214800	1218800	really, really fast. What's your fastest beat? And just, and just, just like, I guess gotta be off
1218880	1224240	balance. I have to stop owning the art of rapping so much. I have to remember what it's like to be
1224240	1234640	a guest in rap. Yo, yo, empty, empty, empty head, empty head. Yo, yo, rapping, rapping. Yo, yo,
1234640	1239760	you're gonna, yo, yo, my microphone's a weapon. I'm a war eater. I fucked your mama so hard,
1239760	1246320	I felt even sorry for her pussy when I tenderized it with my pussy is my dick and my dick's my
1246320	1255200	pussy. What? Yo, yo, yo, my pussy is my dick and my dick is my pussy. Yo, yo, yo, I said my penis
1255200	1261360	is a dick and my dick is a penis. I fucked your mom like my name was Enos from Jukes of Hazzard. He's
1261360	1271040	phone off. You're 25. Feel it. Yo, Houston Avenue, Houston.
1275920	1284000	Houston. Yo, yo, Houston Avenue, east and west. I fucked your mama so hard, she exploded her chest
1284000	1292480	because my penis was that deep and it came out of her nipple and it was a, yeah, I agree, I agree.
1294560	1301200	So you saying, ew, doesn't make me feel nervous. That was my point. You might as well be saying,
1301200	1308880	ew, while you're watching like a bomb go off in Hurt Locker. Do you think the director would be
1308880	1321520	like, oh no, I made Hurt Locker wrong. No, that's her point. Your generation is, you don't get it.
1325440	1331600	Trust me, trust me. And you need to accept it. You always want that explained to you when an
1331600	1336880	old person says it. You guys are always walking on Houston Avenue. You're like, oh, am I in Texas?
1336880	1342720	No, it's a fucking different word. You pronounce it differently. You fucking holograms. You fucking
1342720	1353280	Pokemons. You fucking like hoverboards. You fucking, you fucking Jumanjis. You Jumanji eating
1353280	1363840	Vitamix using fucking matcha drinking, uh, fucking, uh, supplement taking, uh, uh, say it, say it, say it,
1365440	1373040	fucking say it, say it. No, no. The heart wants what it wants, Dan. The heart wants what it wants.
1373040	1376560	Why don't you guys make your stamps more expensive? What the fuck are you doing? Pick a price.
1376560	1384720	Fucking youngsters. When I was, when I was a kid, stamps were cheaper. You guys are crazy.
1386640	1391120	What do you think you're going to find a price that's going to make you a good people?
1392800	1396960	It's a sticker on an envelope. Wake up.
1400720	1402240	The laziest George Carlin.
1406560	1413760	That's funny. The idea of like a curmudgeon who's crediting like, like they're like stamps.
1413760	1418720	We don't use it. I don't have to explain what I was going for, but I, I, I, but I'm telling you,
1418720	1422080	I thought it was funny because you didn't, and I want you to know, I don't care.
1423360	1426160	I have, I have something called agency ever heard of it.
1430720	1433360	Why are you, why are you attacking the crowd so much right now?
1434000	1437600	They're coming at them. They're from New York. They respect you if you're like,
1440320	1446240	this isn't fucking la la land where we can make them applaud by coating ourselves in marshmallows.
1448560	1451600	I'm sure, I'm sure you would kind of be into that, but, but, but, but, but, but, you know,
1451600	1455600	they want, they, they, they need, you need to be salty in New York. They, they, they put it
1455600	1462480	on the streets here when it snows. It's a salty city. You know what Manhattan means in Native
1462480	1471760	American? It means the city of, uh, it needs salty city. Uh, Jack, uh, Jack Gleason was born here.
1473520	1484400	And, uh, he died, uh, on, uh, on, uh, on, on, on, on vacation, uh, um, uh, on a pier outside of, uh,
1484400	1489120	Staten Island where the ferry is. And, uh, but we'll talk about, we're going to talk about that
1489120	1494000	later, uh, and a bunch of other stuff. Um, but first let's, uh, we forgot to bring up Spencer.
1499200	1508560	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, hey guys.
1510480	1515760	That was my bad. You gotta bring this guy up, man. These guys just got cheated out of, like,
1515760	1521120	all, if Spencer could have been up here the whole time, but just Spencer is now like loaded lock,
1521120	1525920	stock and barrel. All right. Let me have it barrel. Especially late on his New York. What do you
1525920	1534640	think? I think the buildings, they're gonna fall apart in California. There's earthquakes. The
1534640	1538640	building codes are really higher and it makes me really nervous when I'm not around those
1538640	1545120	California secured buildings. No offense. It's not any of your faults, probably. Um,
1546800	1550400	so when you walk around these buildings that have been here for a long, long time,
1550400	1554320	yeah. You feel like they might crumble at any moment? Yeah. I mean, you, you know how many
1554320	1559360	like cars or like trucks or like Kool-Aid mans can like burst through a brick wall.
1560480	1565680	Just take out a city block. Do you feel that LA is more Kool-Aid man secure? Like,
1566640	1569040	you know how you never see Kool-Aid man in LA?
1570240	1575200	Well, they don't, they don't, they don't, they don't set out to, to prevent Kool-Aid mannery,
1575200	1580480	but, but by making a building earthquake proof, like Kool-Aid man bounces off of those things.
1580480	1584160	Yeah. He walks into the front door like a person. You know what his catch phrase is in LA? What?
1584160	1591600	Oh, no. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. The Kool-Aid man has to change his catch phrase
1591600	1596480	when he's in LA. These guys, like there are no Kool-Aid commercials anymore. They're like,
1596480	1599520	they're just like, they're being so nice. They're like, I'm sure I'll look it up later. And
1600240	1603840	I'm sure there's such a thing as a Kool-Aid man. And I'm sure he, I'm, I'm sure
1604880	1608720	like maybe he's going to look up what we're talking about. Kool-Aid man used to,
1608720	1614560	he was kind of a terrorist. He would, there would be thirsty children at a party and they go,
1614560	1620960	I'm thirsty. And then a giant terrorist would burst through the wall. It was a man. It wasn't
1620960	1627200	a man. It was a monster. It was, it was an anthropomorphic jug, a jar of jug, a pitcher,
1627200	1632560	an anthropomorphic pitcher of Kool-Aid with a, with a face on it. I think the kids know there's
1632560	1637600	been, there's been family guy episodes about this. Oh, okay. Family guy. All right. Go watch family
1637600	1645280	guys so you can understand my comedy. I wanted to throw the drink down, but then I was like, I'd be,
1645520	1651280	say it. Say the word, Dan. Say the word. I'm not going to say your hate-filled word.
1651920	1657360	I'm, I'm on, I'm on that absinthe right now. Oh, you drank, did you drink some of,
1657360	1661280	yeah, some of Jane's absinthe. I might've drank more than other people who drank it.
1663280	1668960	Yeah. Our friend, Jane, is it cook? Jane Cook makes a, it's so close to Dane Cook that,
1668960	1674320	that she, and Dane Cook did a bit about the Kool-Aid man. He doesn't like it when juice
1674320	1682880	wears tights. Yeah. From that album in like 19, I don't know. So I'm treading in safe water. That's
1682880	1689680	what we're saying. No, you, you took it in a whole new left field direction. His catchphrase is oh no
1689680	1695360	in LA. When you're at a party as a kid in LA and you go, I'm thirsty. And then they, like you,
1695360	1702320	sometimes you'll hear a thud. And then like a crack of glass, the shattering of glass. And someone
1702400	1711440	saying, oh no. And that's how you know that you should buy Kool-Aid. Because remember the
1711440	1718160	commercials aren't for architecture. No. If they were, the Kool-Aid corporation would be like,
1718160	1722480	let's not, let's not air this, but there are LA commercials where you hear the thud
1722480	1726000	and hear, oh no. And they say, look, it's still fucking delicious. He just can't get into your
1726000	1734640	house unless you invite him in. He's like a vampire. Yeah. Let the right Kool-Aid jug in.
1734640	1738800	Except unlike a vampire, when you do invite him in, then he goes, I'm trying. I can't fit.
1739840	1743680	Why do you think I come through the wall? I'm nine feet wide. Come around the back. We have
1743680	1748400	a backyard. Come around the gate. We have a, we have a, we have a, we have a, we have to,
1748400	1752240	we have to have my, we have to have my birthday party at a, at a, at a stadium with a dome so
1752240	1757440	that you can, so that he can, you can hear, oh yeah. And he's dropped it. But dumb. I got excited.
1757440	1760320	I got, I stuttered. And it was like, why is he, why did he stutter for that? Why,
1760320	1763120	why did that make him excited? Did he think it was going to be neat to what he said?
1765200	1769680	Honey, why do you think, what do you, what do you think causes Dan stutter? I think, I think,
1769680	1773280	I think it seems like when he gets really excited about what he's going to say next,
1773280	1776160	why, why would he be excited about that, that stadium thing?
1776640	1781600	I don't, well, he doesn't always know, sweetie. It's not, it's not a written show. He's not,
1782160	1786240	he's, he's not a proud person. It's not, the show's not called Dan Harmon's proud of himself.
1787840	1792800	And it's, and even if it was the content of the show doesn't need to prove the title, right?
1793920	1795760	There's no bondage in family ties.
1795760	1806080	Night, Night, Night Rider doesn't wear armor and they doesn't exist. There's
1806080	1813760	nobody named Night Rider in that show. There's a guy named Knight. The car's name is Kit.
1813760	1820080	Look it up. This is all New York shit. You should be into this. It should be called Kit Rider.
1821040	1821680	Thank you.
1826400	1831760	I'll be here till Thursday. Why? I think that's when I go home.
1833840	1837680	You here till Thursday? I think. I don't know. All right. Well, we're being rude to our guests.
1837680	1843520	I, so, oh, so here's the thing in introducing this, our friend, I want to explain to you why
1843520	1849120	I'm here. It's for UNICEF. There's a basket being passed. Real funny. They're crippled.
1850880	1854800	Okay, great.
1859280	1863200	Yo, yo, yo, yo, UNICEF.
1868320	1872400	They need your money real bad because some people are born with the chances you didn't have.
1873120	1877680	You were born with two arms. Some people weren't. Give them money.
1878560	1880560	Is that what UNICEF is?
1883920	1888720	UNICEF needs better PR. So give them money so you can know who they are.
1891600	1893600	Yo, yo.
1895920	1903440	Yeah, please help UNICEF tonight. We've forgotten what they are. And that is a terrible life for
1903440	1908640	a charity. UNICEF needs your help before it gets to go back to helping people.
1909440	1914240	Help them brand themselves. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, March of Dimes, who could forget them? I mean,
1914240	1921600	it's like, wow, obviously the people. What does March of Dimes do? What does March of Dimes do?
1922320	1926640	Well, they, I mean, doesn't it, doesn't it sound like a horrible horror premise, the March of Dimes?
1927680	1931040	I was, I would, it always scared me when I would hear that. Like, I'm sorry,
1931040	1934880	don't forget March of Dimes is coming. Why is that? Why is it scary?
1935520	1939600	The March of anything is scary. Okay. But Dimes are so small.
1942960	1946400	Yeah. But it's like, it's not like, it's like the March of souls. Like, it's not the things
1946400	1950560	aren't marching. The souls are terrifying. It's the March. It's the March. It's, but the thing
1950560	1956080	that's the March of is not the thing that's marching though. The, the, the, the March,
1956080	1964400	the March of, of, of genocide is not, is, is, is, is Nazis. The March of Dimes is like these,
1964400	1968720	I don't know what's coming, but it wants your dimes. And I haven't had any since 1968.
1969680	1974240	It's a, it's, it's worse than a penny because it's smaller and there's a guy on it. It looks,
1974240	1980880	it looks like a, a, a, a, a, who's on the dime, Dan? The, the dime it's, it's Michael Chiklis is on
1980880	1986080	the dime. If you really, if you really look at it, I think that from my memory, I haven't
1986080	1991600	looked at a dime since before I heard of Michael Chiklis, but based on I'm, I'm remembering Michael
1991600	1997920	Chiklis on the dime. Our next guest played the thing in the first Fantastic Four movie, Michael
1997920	2004000	Chiklis. If Michael Chiklis came out right now, that'd be the best segue of all the time. You gotta,
2004000	2009680	you gotta see, see if you can find Roger Corman's horrible, shitty, I have to hurry up and finish
2009760	2014640	making this movie or I'll lose the rights to make it a Fantastic Four movie, which Michael Chiklis
2014640	2021600	plays the thing. And, and he, and he, and because he already says it's clobberin' time in the first
2021600	2025840	half of the movie, he's left with nothing else to say. But at the end of the movie, when he comes
2025840	2033680	into the third act, he goes, it's clobberin' time for real. It's so sad. It's like a, like a, like
2033680	2042800	an alcoholic dad. We're going to the zoo and I mean it. Sorry. Sorry about the last clobberin'
2042800	2050960	time. I kind of got interrupted. I fell asleep. It's, it's the clobberin' thought that counts.
2053440	2061040	I apologize. You know, my dad hit me 10 times more than yours hits you. And that's the progress.
2061040	2069680	I consider myself a pacifist compared to him. You're welcome. So clobberin' time is terrifying
2069680	2076960	for the kids. March of Dimes, it's like, it sounds like, like, like, like, like it follows,
2076960	2081040	like that's an innocuous, but terrifying, it follows what follows March of Dimes. What do
2081040	2087360	they want? They want dimes. Well, but why? Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like,
2087360	2091440	pumpkin head. Like, that's scary because it sounds like dumb, like, like, pumpkin head. Oh,
2091440	2097920	fuck. All right. Come on. We have a guest tonight. So the reason I'm in New York
2097920	2109680	is not for UNICEF. That was all a joke. And scene. All right.
2118000	2121920	Yeah. He got, well, yeah. Well, see, touch my hair and then, and then say gross.
2123840	2126000	So now I'm, now I'm, now I'm 11 again.
2128400	2131520	I just fucked you in the butt. And then that wasn't enough for you.
2134800	2138160	That's the greatest compliment a person can give another person is to fuck them right in the butt.
2139120	2142160	Um, right. Yeah. Right. New York.
2149760	2153040	New York is a butt. They call it. They call it. Well, they call it. They call it sodomy is called
2154960	2162160	a New York salute. I couldn't think of anything better. The next guy could come up with something
2162160	2166320	better because he's our guest and he's a, he's a professional comedy writer. My
2166400	2172080	checklist. So, so, so the reason I'm here in New York is because I'm,
2172080	2179440	I'm shooting this thing for IFC ever heard of it. Uh, uh, uh, unlike these other basic cable
2179440	2184080	networks, their name still means something. It's a Rob bone documentary about monkeys starting the
2184080	2189680	fire of, uh, from 1921. I mean, because you, you, when you hear the description of the pilot,
2189680	2195280	you'll go, what does that have to do with independence or film? But, uh, if you think,
2195360	2199520	if you really think about it, you'll go, Oh, because the network is going to, is going to,
2199520	2203760	you're going to have a new slogan like TLC, you know, it's like, cause they show the things that
2203760	2210000	it's like, what duck, duck town. What is this? But then as if an apology, they go like TLC,
2210000	2217840	cause you could learn about anything. It's all, it's all animal planet. It's, it's very human,
2217840	2221840	meaning there's no fucking animals in that goddamn fucking channel. Yeah. Humans are animals too.
2222400	2225360	Why do you apologize and make different programming then? There has been,
2225360	2228000	there has been no arts or entertainment on A and E for
2228960	2232240	change your name to television station number nine.
2237520	2244880	Uh, say it, say the word, say the word here on AMC where you're watching new classics was they
2244880	2251680	happen toothpaste wars on the history channel. Cause Hey, some people might hear about this one
2251840	2263280	day. If you watch the slut, slut night on discovery channel, no, no disclaimer necessary
2263280	2270320	discover that everything's a discovery. So what night, what is, what, what happens? What do you
2270320	2275200	think is going to happen on season three of a slut night? Uh, well, they're, they're, they're,
2275280	2282800	they're kicking Maggie off. No, we love Maggie. She's a slut. She's the sluttiest one. Oh yeah.
2282800	2288480	You guys, New York hates Maggie, of course. Well, yeah. But by the way, she's from Long Island,
2289440	2294880	but she says, she says New York, but, and, and, and, and, and, and I'm sorry,
2294880	2298960	I'm not going to win any popularity contest for saying this, but she's no slut.
2299920	2309040	There. I said it. She's not a slut. She's, we've divided the crowd on that one. She has agency.
2310320	2311360	They edit it out.
2316400	2320240	More sluts, discovery channel, less fake sluts.
2320240	2329920	She's a, she's a, she's a, she's a, she's an autonomous person with, with, with, with status
2329920	2337120	and make, uh, uh, okay. Um, so the reason I'm here is, uh, we're doing IFC, uh, we're, we're
2337120	2343600	shooting a pilot. They've cast me as a host and I don't think you have to ask why have I, uh,
2343600	2350800	cause just look at what you've seen tonight. Um, uh, is it, is it a show about Asperger's,
2350800	2361120	Dan? Why are you, is it, is it a show for the blind? Uh, is it a show in which there's, there's,
2361920	2367280	uh, names of people's, uh, uh, pictures of people's faces on the floor so that what,
2367280	2370320	what normally looks like someone staring at the floor while they talk
2370880	2374800	is the new definition of a professional host.
2376640	2381360	Are current, is it, is it a show called this week's current events as floor tile?
2383120	2388560	How did you get this job? I don't know. It's a bad economy. It's like, like,
2388560	2392160	times are tough and, and, and no one's watching TV anymore. And they're just,
2392160	2397600	is there so much cachet in the Dan Harmon brand right now that we want you to host our show?
2397600	2400960	It's a, it's a two, we're meeting in the middle. Like, like, like, like,
2400960	2406800	my podcast is gaining a few listeners, TV's losing a few, uh, viewers. And so we meet in
2406800	2410000	a nice happy middle. Yeah. They're like, how about you? I don't know. We ran out of people.
2410640	2413840	Um, who do you think they passed on right before it came to you?
2413840	2415680	One of them is our next guest actually.
2419120	2422960	For real? Yeah. I know. I, you'd think we wouldn't get along because, but I really like
2422960	2425840	this guy. I've just been chatting with him for five minutes backstage, but he's, he's,
2425920	2429440	he's not better. His reputation. No, he's not. He's, he's, you know, he's, he's, yeah. Well,
2429440	2434320	well you'll find out he's a wonderful personality. He's, he's, he's from Long Island. Are you from
2434320	2439920	Long Island? Um, uh, uh, which I kind of shit on just a second ago, but I don't know anything about
2439920	2446640	it. So it doesn't matter. Um, uh, the, the, uh, anyways, so, so the thing that we're doing
2446640	2451280	is, is this, uh, well, we'll talk about it with him as a way of explaining it because otherwise
2451280	2458400	then I'm going to, you know, I think I will be like 12 and like, I won't have the title of this
2458400	2468400	episode. It will be Dan introduces and we never missed such a good episode. He talked about slavery.
2470960	2475280	Is the IFC show going to be this riveting? Is it going to be like, like this kind of
2475280	2485200	trenchant interviews? Let's bring them out. No, stop it. Um, well, if I didn't need to do a
2485200	2489280	good introduction, like a good host test. Okay. Let's take it from the top. You want,
2489280	2493040	you want like music for the, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Beat, beat Dick Cavett. Pretend
2493040	2496560	you're sitting on the couch and it's like, you know, it's, it's groovy. It's the seventies. Like,
2496560	2502000	like you're going to bring somebody out and like few television shows in recent memory have had
2502000	2513600	as much impact on the entertainer sphere as the deceptively named daily show. Uh,
2513600	2525200	for truly it is a show for the century. And although it airs daily, there's nothing daily
2525200	2529360	about it. There's a lot of daily stuff about it. Um, anyways, we all love the daily show. This guy,
2529440	2534640	this guy was, this guy was the, let's take it from the top, Dan. Let's take it from the top. Uh,
2535520	2545760	guest intro, take two. Long Island born stand up comic and comedy writer and television producer,
2546400	2551120	but you can't say his name in the middle of the introduction. Um, uh, so-and-so is,
2551120	2556160	they can't say that. That makes it sound like, take three, take three, guest intro, take three,
2556880	2562080	take three. This, this next Long Island born stand up comic and television producer. Um,
2563120	2565840	now that sounds like we have a lot of them. No, that's great. That's so good.
2567040	2572800	Dan, Dan, so good. We go live in 15 seconds. Our next guest,
2573520	2581520	Long Island birth and stand up comedy has been the talk of town in Staten Island and at the daily
2581520	2589040	show, we're over 13 years. Ladies and gentlemen, my new friend and a guy who's going to be
2589040	2595920	performing in the, uh, pilot that we're going to be telling you a little bit about UNICEF founder
2595920	2610800	and inventor of the Bechdel test, which was then given credit, the credit was given to some woman.
2615120	2617280	You're welcome. Jenny Bechdel.
2626000	2630160	You know that, you know, she came up with that test and it was a terrible breakup with a man
2630160	2640400	that defined her life. We'll be right back. We're going to go commercial. Gold bond powder,
2641360	2645840	UNICEF. We're getting better every day.
2648960	2652320	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Rory Albanese.
2656880	2662320	I think I'll sit here. Hello. I'm very sorry. I'm sorry.
2665360	2673760	What an intro. I want to watch that show. Just you introing me everybody. So Dan beat you out of
2673760	2677680	a job to host the show. He did. I didn't even think of it that way. I would never have said yes to this
2677680	2685040	shit because we're arts nemesis. Is that the right word? All I heard was that while they were singing
2685120	2688320	your praises, like there was just, there was that much of a clause in it that was like,
2688320	2692080	he actually was going to host or wanted to host. And I was like, Oh, that sounds like a,
2692080	2695280	that sounds like he'll be a real Robin to my Batman.
2697840	2701360	That's a good thing, right? Robin your Batman. Well, that's the sarcasm.
2704000	2708880	The sarcasm might be more like the scarecrow. Uh, yeah. I gotcha. I'm sorry. No, not at all.
2708880	2713040	I think it's great that you're hosting. Yeah. Cause we like each other. Cause we immediately
2713040	2717760	started talking about witcher three and video games and we did, uh, we did witcher three.
2717760	2723520	What's up ladies. Yeah. I'm talking about witcher two, like a bunch of losers.
2724560	2730560	But the third one. Yeah. It's cause we got enough money for a PS4. Yeah. Um,
2732080	2736320	wait, does it, did my mic go off or am I just less effective? I don't hear you. I think it went off.
2737040	2745280	All right. Yeah. Okay. Well, so you, you're, you're, you come from the, um, from the, from the whiplash,
2745280	2753200	uh, breakneck thrill a minute world of daily. There's a fucking intro. Yeah. Yeah, man. Now
2753200	2759920	you're doing it in the outback of pickle dick boomerang zoom, zoomery. That is the daily show.
2759920	2764800	Yes. Pickle dickery is our fucking motto, man. You don't have a pickle dick. Get off the fucking
2764800	2770640	can. That's what we say. It's on the bumper sticker guys. Daily show left no dick on pickles.
2770640	2774720	On pickles. Yeah. Every now and then a fucking Republican will come through and be like,
2774720	2778880	pickle that dick. You know, people will be like, these guys are on the fucking pulse.
2780960	2787520	They got their fucking beat on the dick on the pulse. You know what I mean? Did you, did you
2787520	2792320	start, uh, you started doing standup, I assume, and then like, like kind of branched into writing
2792320	2796880	or were you always doing standup right when I started, this is not going to be that exciting.
2796880	2802560	I was a lot. There was like, hey, that's my job. Uh, saying that it was, uh, it was right. We were
2802560	2807440	rapping before. Um, let me just say something very quickly about long Island and its defense.
2808240	2813120	All right. Surprisingly short. Yes. Surprisingly short. Also Brooklyn and Queens are on long
2813120	2817600	Island. All right. So just for the record, when some fucking ding dong from Brooklyn is like,
2817600	2820160	oh, you're going to long Island. Be like, that's where you live. All right.
2821120	2825760	That's where you fucking live. When I was a kid, you fucking live. It's on the Island. Brooklyn,
2825760	2831840	Queens. When I was 10, uh, me and my friend lit a, uh, a telephone pole on fire. It's the
2831840	2837360	opposite talking. This can't be true. For real. It was, uh, it was the fourth of July and we put
2837360	2841840	a bunch of firecrackers inside a telephone pole because there was bugs in it. Do you know what
2841840	2847360	telephone poles are? I feel like we're going to find out that it's like a coin purse or something.
2847600	2851280	No, there's a telephone post. There's those things with, with the leaves and the apples.
2851280	2854480	And they're very flammable. I also love that. You're like, you're like,
2854480	2856320	cause there were bugs in it. So we did the right thing.
2858880	2863200	We were 11 or 10 years old and we were being assholes and there was like termites inside
2863200	2868320	this telephone post. Yeah. So we put a bunch of firecrackers in it and fireworks and then it lit
2868320	2873280	on fire and the fire of the fire department. Yeah. The guys who, the guys who saved people
2873280	2877920	had fired the barber. We, uh, we boned the fuck out, but we, uh, we, we, we, we lit a telephone
2877920	2882160	pole on fire. What did it, what does it look like when it's on fire? Like a giant tree without
2882160	2888320	leaves on fire. Wow. Did they, did how long did service go down for? I don't know that it did.
2888320	2892320	Wow. That's just a poll. The telephone doesn't go through. I think that says a lot about land lines,
2892320	2896320	guys. You know what I mean? People are really against land lines these days, but that says a
2896320	2902000	lot. You can light them right up on fire. Try lighting a fucking saddle light on fire using
2902000	2905120	your cell phone. Orange County in Long Island. There's an Orange County, right? Orange County is
2905120	2909600	in New Jersey, but it doesn't matter. There's counties and shit. No, Nassau. Yeah. Spencer,
2909600	2916560	weren't you telling me that if you, that if you, somebody likes jet skis. This is, this is why I'm
2916560	2919440	a bad host because I'm still hung up on something and I haven't heard anything for the last three
2919440	2925440	minutes, but the, uh, the, the, the, didn't you tell me, Spencer, that cell phones, when you call
2925440	2930000	911 on the cell phone, it's like, uh, there, like if you call it on a land line, it's like, it's,
2930000	2933600	it's the key. Are you calling 911? You're getting connected. And then the response is like, uh,
2934800	2939440	there's like a delay or something. What you aren't telling, you look confused. I didn't say any of
2939440	2944000	that. Like we're all using cell phones now, but like, I remember when you said that shit, man,
2944000	2951920	why are you bucking out of it now? There's one thing. Shut up about it. Don't call 911 on your
2951920	2957680	cell phone. Got a t-shirt on it. Shit. I remember all of it. Dude, I'm totally, you're Robin.
2958160	2967200	Holy Robin would say shit like that. Do you feel like Dan is a better host than you? Yes.
2967200	2970240	I do. Yes. I'm at the ECB. You're supposed to say yes and to everything.
2972800	2979360	Yes. And I think his dick's bigger. So there you go. Why would I say that? I'm terrible at improv.
2980320	2986560	Yes. My dick is bigger and we're on the moon now with our giant dicks. Oh no,
2986560	2994000	there's no gravity. My giant dick is somewhere. Call the president and seen. Yes. And see how
2994000	2998240	I heightened it. You got to call the president because there's no one higher than the president.
2998240	3003200	It's called the ECB level. Fucking get it, fucking get it down. Yeah. Yeah. I was just in a really
3003200	3007840	great ass cat show. Was anybody, when are any of you there? Did anybody hit the double jackpot of
3007840	3013040	getting into that show and this one? Wow. Really? Are you just, okay. They love clap.
3013040	3016720	You improv drop it or are you fucking really there guys? There's two or three people that said yes.
3016720	3020640	Sometimes people don't, I don't want to be a dick, but he used to be. Did you host it? Like,
3020640	3025520	were you doing the monologue portion of it? He intro'd all the performers. They were there
3025520	3031840	for 16 hours. Yeah. It was, it was the only way to close out the Del Close marathon is they have Dan
3031840	3036960	intro four people and it takes up the whole 24 hours. Dan is the Michael Jordan. That's in fact,
3036960	3041280	that's how they do it. It's actually how Del Close died. I was introducing him to his doctor.
3043360	3046400	You were trying to tell his doctor what was wrong. You're like, you have to understand.
3046400	3051440	He has this thing. Let me tell you about things. And then there was blood coming out of his,
3051440	3053760	what do you call that hole? You don't want about holes. I like holes.
3054640	3056880	I've reloaded a telephone pole and fire. What's going on right now?
3057680	3062240	So the premise of this IFC thing, well, you just said, I don't want to be a dick,
3062240	3065680	but UCB East, what were you going to, I didn't want to, I didn't want to remember. Oh,
3065680	3069600	something's going to be stupid. It made sense at the moment, but now it feels weird.
3069600	3074480	I think now's the time to vent why you hate UCB so much. Yeah. Because they're so, uh,
3074480	3079040	ungenerous. It's cultish. It's cultish. That's my issue with it. Yeah. Like I had to fucking
3079040	3084160	blow Matt Walsh three times just to get here tonight. Yeah. True story. And I blew him years
3084160	3091440	ago too. And this is it. And he denied it. He still denies it. He said, no, but do it again.
3091760	3095680	What are you doing? What are you doing? You're supposed to say yes and reach under the ball.
3097200	3103120	Fucking basic shit. That's fucking BJ's one. That's level one BJ. I gave Matt Besser one of
3103120	3107280	the worst hand jobs I've ever given. Heard about that hand job. I saw his one man show bad.
3108320	3114480	Besser's bad HJ's. That's all that. Um, the, uh, show that we're doing on Wednesday,
3114480	3118720	which I think it's already, if you, if you didn't move on the tweet that I sent out,
3118720	3123360	then I just feel bad for you. Uh, I sent out a tweet today because it's, it's, it's in another
3123360	3128400	small space. So I'm sure it was like, uh, why am I being so cocky? Well, because it, because it's
3128400	3134880	not really cocky. It feels sad. And it's like watching a guy brag about the size of it. When
3134880	3139280	you're hosting the show, are they going to, if they say, when we open the show, your, your camera
3139280	3142480	is camera two, you're going to look right into camera two. Are you, are you still going to look
3142480	3146160	at the floor? I don't know. I'm not. They're not idiots. Camera two is on the floor. They know what
3146240	3149840	they're doing. Guys, it's professionally produced. They know what they're doing.
3151040	3156560	Um, the, uh, it's, it's at this, uh, I have no idea where it is. It's at 106 and park. Don't line
3156560	3161760	up now guys. You'll get in. We're sitting next to a guy. Don't spend the weekend. He's got a
3161760	3166960	great baritone voice. He makes eye contact. He's not uncomfortable getting up and walking around
3166960	3172480	and working the room. This old thing. How did, how did you listen? Because I think that, I think
3172480	3177680	that one of the guys at IFC, not the production company that's making the pilot, I think they're,
3177680	3183200	because they're always like, IFC is so excited that you're hosting. So I'm like, oh, that means
3183200	3190480	you hate me. But, but, but, um, uh, the, the, so I think maybe someone at IFC, like, uh, uh,
3190480	3196320	maybe they, maybe my dad called them and was like, listen to me. This son works hard. Wait a minute.
3196320	3200720	You're, wait, our dads are allowed to do that. Yeah. I've called my dad off for years and we're
3200720	3205120	like, don't do it. Don't do it. No, you shouldn't. Oh my God. I'm an idiot. Because if my dad calls
3205120	3209520	you, you will fucking break down after a while. Do you know that they, they are capable of driving
3209520	3214400	you all the way to McDonald's or school and you don't have to get out a block away. That's a
3214400	3218800	choice you made. I didn't know that. When you were a flawed person, because you can, you can
3218800	3224400	rekindle that. Dad, drive me all the way to McDonald's. Yeah. Wow. Take me back to the
3224400	3228800	beginning of that story. You got, you know, when your friends and see your dad, you want him to
3228800	3233040	think you disappear places. I get it. Before you can drive, you don't want your friends to know your
3233040	3237280	parents brought you. You want them to think you just fucking, maybe you're like in that awesome
3237280	3244720	movie where they jump leapers, jumpers. What's that movie where they jump? I think it's leapers.
3247680	3251760	What's that leaping movie where they jump? What the fuck is the name of that movie?
3251760	3259200	The sequel is leapers too. No, because sometimes I get loopers and jumpers confused, but you don't
3259200	3263440	want to do that shit. No, no, don't look at brainos. You don't watch those movies back to back
3263440	3268800	either. It's a bet. It's a red, it's like fucking ammonium bleach guys. If your dad's still around,
3268800	3272800	is he alive? Yeah, he's a leaper. Are you close with your dad? I was. And then he fucking leaped
3272800	3277280	away for a pack of smokes. When I was 20, when I was 20, he's like, I'm going to leap for a pack
3277280	3282800	of smokes. Yeah, we're close enough. Are you close? Are you friends? We're not friends. Did you get
3282800	3288480	along? Jesus Christ, what's going on here right now? I'm going to cry a little bit now. I don't
3288480	3298240	know. I mean, do you call them up once in a while? I call them sometimes for my mom and then help
3298240	3303440	pick up so that I got to fucking, you know, talk to him a little bit. What is it about that? I got
3303440	3307520	to run interference. You know, I got to be like, yeah, yeah, that's good. Was mom around? Because I
3307520	3310400	have something I'd like to communicate to a human. So you're close to mom.
3313520	3319680	That's basically it. I don't know. Anyway, if you guys ever seen Leapers, dude, that movie is
3319680	3324080	fucking. Leapers can't be choosers. They cannot. That's true. That is sound advice,
3324080	3327440	especially with the young people in the room. If you're looking for a leaper, don't be picky.
3327440	3331760	What is it about your dad that creates the distance? I don't know. He's a fucking Italian guy. You know
3331840	3336320	what I mean? He's Italian Italian. Yeah, he's Italian pronounces it wrong. Yeah, yeah. He's so
3336320	3341120	Italian. He gets all Italians to pronounce everything wrong. It's not, it's not per jute.
3341120	3345600	It's per juteau, but that's just New York. That's just Goombatz behavior is what that is.
3346720	3350880	I have a half Goombatz side. That's a little Goombatz. You know what I mean? You guys,
3350880	3354720	the long one lady who cheered for Nassau County is like, he fucking gets it.
3355680	3359520	So everybody else is like, well, no, Williamsburg doesn't have her.
3360320	3362960	Are you a New York Italian all the way across the board? Yeah,
3362960	3367360	no, not all the way. The other half is Jew. Yeah, I'm sorry. Don't leave.
3369360	3373040	I never say you're a Jew in a crowded theater. I learned that and I, I fucked it up.
3374720	3381200	There's a back door. So your, your mom is Jewish. My dad's Italian and I'm a therapy.
3382000	3387600	I'm actually not in there. I'm not in therapy. It's fine. It worked out fine.
3387600	3391680	You're closer to Jewish mom than Italian dad. Yeah. Just cause my mom's like, uh,
3391680	3396720	you know, like she can like talk and shit, you know, my dad's like, my dad just says like
3396720	3400960	platitudes. Like he just was like a handbook. He's like, Hey, he calls me his Hollywood son.
3400960	3404160	He's like, Hey, how's my Hollywood son? I'm like, I've never really lived in Hollywood.
3404160	3406880	You know what I mean? He's like, what are you doing? You making a movie? What are you hanging
3406880	3412000	out? Brad Pitt. I'm like, is mom around? Is mom there? Cause I just want to talk to like a fucking
3412000	3416400	normal thing. Somebody normal. I don't want to keep just everything.
3418400	3423280	Hey, look, I got a case of the Monday's already skies. I don't want to freak out,
3423280	3428400	but I'm pretty contagious. I got the Mondays. Is that, is, or is that Kathy or Ziggy? I'm sorry.
3428400	3434560	Do you ever hug Garfield? Jesus Christ. Yeah. Hug him. I mean, I hug him. You never like on
3434560	3438320	a holiday. I love your dad. No, I love him. I hug him, but you say it. Do you say, I say,
3438320	3442400	love you, but put mom on. You know what I mean? Like, I don't hate to do it. I just,
3442400	3445520	I want to fucking talk to him that much. I don't say, I don't tell my parents. I love them.
3445520	3450960	You know, I tell your mom, I'm just kidding. I stopped my, I stopped myself. That was a
3450960	3456080	fucking low. That was a real long Island moment. You're turning into your father.
3456080	3463040	I don't know what up there. Get out of here. You're not, you're not my real dad.
3463040	3466560	All of a sudden I'm just sitting here in tidy whiteys and fucking black dress socks. I'm like,
3466560	3474640	what happened? She has eyes on. I will, I will text. I love you too. Wow.
3474640	3479200	And your parents can read texts. What are they, what are they 30? My mom just,
3479200	3484160	my mom just learned like, like, like, I think she was only direct tweeting me.
3486080	3489760	I think your mom can tweet. My mom's like, explain the Twitter. I'm like,
3489760	3494160	you hate it. You'll hate it. I don't want her near. My mom has a locked, uh,
3494160	3498960	account. So I guess she, she could read my tweets and then she'll direct. She would
3499840	3504240	direct tweet me, which comes to my phone as a text message. And I would just direct
3504240	3508320	tweet her back and go, just, you can text me and we can just go back and forth. And it's,
3508320	3513200	it's, it's less advanced than what you're doing. She's gone. She's gone. She's gone.
3513200	3517440	Pass the easy thing. Yeah. She's like, I'm hearing Jimmy, like the ghost in the beginning
3517440	3524480	of 2010. The guy was like, Oh, I'm a being of energy from the first movie in 2010. Hold on.
3524480	3532560	The year we made contact. Oh, contact. No, no, no. No, it's 2010. The year we made contact is,
3532560	3537200	is not a, it's not the make of the movie. I guess I never really saw that movie,
3537200	3542160	but I did like that new McConaughey goes to space movie that just came out.
3542160	3545120	I'd really like to see 2009. The reason we made contact.
3546400	3548720	Cause I have some questions. I've seen first contact.
3548720	3553840	That's a fine Star Trek film. The, but there was a sequel to 2001 called 2010.
3553840	3558880	Wow. Is that like the whiz? It's, it's, it's, it's terrible. Oh, so it's like the whiz.
3560800	3565280	In that it's, it's based on the, they didn't pay for the rights to 2001, the movie they based it
3565280	3571360	on the original books. It's like, Oh look, it's, it's Dorothy, I guess, but it's, but the public
3571360	3578880	domain version, she's not allowed to. Um, the, uh, Utah, the fuck was a, uh, oh, my, yeah,
3578880	3584880	my pouch. How did the monkeys start that fire? Oh, well, it could be flying monkeys. I mean,
3584880	3588080	I'm not, I'm just saying we're talking about the wizard. They did. They didn't. I told you,
3588080	3591760	I looked it up on Snopes. It was, uh, it was, uh, didn't I already say something about the
3591760	3598080	great fire of 1830? Yeah, it was Dominicans. And then when it was, it was, I know it was,
3598800	3603600	exactly. Just so you get a sense of how racist America was back then. Dan, if I can be quite
3603600	3608240	honest, we deal in honesty here backstage, Dan was coming down on the Dominicans pretty hard.
3608240	3614320	Pretty hard. I just like, well, I like, what is your fucking beef with the Dominicans? Well,
3614320	3620000	are they really a Republic? Wow. You make a lot. Look, you're making a lot of sense right now,
3620000	3625760	Dan. Do you get to just throw that word around? We're the Dominican Republic. Okay. I'm, I'm the
3625840	3632080	Dan Harmon Republic. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, come on. You're just,
3632080	3635600	you're just, you're just, you're just, you're just Domenico. You know what this is guys? I don't
3635600	3639600	want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to get involved here, but he's part Puerto Rican.
3639600	3643520	That's where this anger comes from. Yeah. The Puerto Ricans, the Mincans, you know,
3643520	3648880	because it's a PRDR. There's a thing. I'm telling you, that's a real fucking, if you weren't also
3648880	3655440	fucking white, if you ever talk to the people in the neighborhoods you live in, you would learn
3655440	3659520	that there's a lot of inter-race hatred and you don't have to feel bad about it because you didn't
3659520	3665840	cause this. You're an Italian. So I'm assuming that you're a jet versus a, a shark. A shark. Oh
3665840	3671520	yeah. I'm a jet all the way, baby. From my first cigarette to my last dying day. Yeah. I don't think
3671520	3680160	you can get out. You can't get out. This just got really gay. Do you have a rocket in your pocket?
3680880	3684240	Do I have a rocket in my pockets? Yeah. We're on stage, my friend.
3685360	3690960	These are backstage. When I watch, uh, uh, what's it, what's it called? West Side Story.
3690960	3696640	I don't know. The absence just fucking kicked in. Uh, all right. Okay. So yeah, we were talking
3696640	3702080	about, let's just be clear about this. Somebody gave you a fucking Jane, what looks basically
3702080	3711120	like, all right. So somebody it's Jane Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane. All right. Whatever your name is, Jane.
3711120	3717040	Um, it's Jane. This looks like some shady olive oil in a jar and he's just drinking it. You just
3717040	3721120	fucking bought like Crisco. We're like, I made an absent. Let's see how much I'll drink. And he's
3721120	3727040	fucking pounding that shit. No, cause it could be LSD in there or something. Well, I told you
3727200	3731200	on behalf of Jane's a trusted like member of the harm and town family. She is. Yeah. Oh,
3731200	3737840	that sounds legit. I mean, if harm and down trust her, well, we're a Republican. I mean,
3739760	3746240	if she has the harm and down FDA approval, how could she not be okay? Why would she want to
3746240	3752400	see you guys strip your balls off up here? Take a big swing off that.
3752400	3762880	Fuck dude. Fucking Hey, that's like gasoline, Jane. You could, you could, you could absolutely
3762880	3771680	run a lawnmower. I'll do one little babysit. No, that's like, wow. That's like that, uh,
3771680	3775680	puts down line in the naked gun when he's like, you know, it's like drinking Drano. It'll clean
3775680	3780560	you out inside. It's exactly taking a sip of that. Yeah. I've got, I've got bad experiences with,
3780560	3784640	with Jane's concoctions, but I, and I have to write the show that we're taping on Wednesday
3784640	3791600	tonight, or I just will never be written. Oh, more. Jane's got a deep voice.
3793600	3799600	That's good. Um, so, so advice on like, because you worked with one of the great TV hosts,
3799600	3805280	that's pretty easy. Um, we have to do this thing on Wednesday. We're so drunk last night. The
3805280	3810080	premise of the pilot that we're doing is that I am the host, which is already kind of a,
3810240	3814160	no, no, first of all, Dan's a great host. So enough with this bullshit.
3814160	3819520	Second of all, the premise of the pilot is that he, is it so Rupert Murdoch's son? And then is
3819520	3823920	that fucking it up? No, I, I didn't hear it was a subplot version of the show you guys developed
3823920	3831040	before you got fired. Yeah. I'm just, I do a big tap dance number and everyone loves me.
3831040	3835600	What do you mean? I don't have the job. And there I am. Just me and the people
3836400	3843440	and I'm singing a song. It seems perfect. This is for IFC. I, I said, tap dance over.
3843440	3846800	Your deal was about to close when they found your anti-vax blog and they're like,
3846800	3852160	this isn't going to work for, okay. So I fucking, but they saw my selfies with
3852160	3857200	fucking Jenny McCarthy. Like she knows she gets it. She gets it. Well, who's second on the list?
3857200	3861200	I have a selfie stick. I'm not an idiot. I'm not going to take a selfie with Jenny McCarthy
3861200	3867280	without a selfie stick. What do we, I mean, good try Jane. Good try. Like what, when you're
3867280	3871760	doing a, are there do's and don'ts like on the daily show. So John would have, you know, he's got
3871760	3877520	a guest in every episode virtually. They're coming out. Like what, how did you, how did you prep for
3877520	3882240	like, like how, how tightly did he adhere to a plan that was done through pre interviews and stuff
3882240	3891600	like that? It depends on the guests. I mean, the thing that was interesting about the daily show,
3900320	3907200	look, I'm more of a Kilborn man myself. That's on the daily show. I love what was daily. I love
3907200	3911840	when like, he's already fucked up. I love that the crowd groans. You know, they're like, Oh dude,
3911840	3918640	he said Kilborn. Take a big one. Take it. Go, go. Big one. Oh, Jane. Muscle up. I have a feeling Jane
3918640	3923760	could be fucking Jim and I'm not going to know at the end of the night. Uh, well, funny. You should
3923760	3930320	say that. I'm just kidding guys. I know gender's not a thing anymore. I get it. I'm kidding. Jane,
3930320	3936000	John, it's all shoulders up. I get it. If you think you're a lady, you're a lady. I read the papers.
3937200	3941840	This is terrible. Jane is actually is a transgender. Uh, it's not terrible. I think
3941840	3947920	it's fantastic. I'm all for Jane being transgender. My, my only issue with transgender is they say
3947920	3950960	you're the only question you can't ask is you have a dick. And I keep saying that's the only
3950960	3956400	question I have. If I can't ask that, then let's not talk about it. Did you see our mutual friend,
3956400	3962000	John Oliver's, uh, uh, uh, this week tonight about the transgender thing? Yes. Were you kind of like,
3962000	3966880	like, like, I found myself feeling ashamed right away because already it's like, Oh, I, like,
3967120	3971680	I was patting myself on the back just for getting through the door of like, of not, you know, not
3971680	3975200	bullying and all this stuff. And I was like, and now I'm like, you know, they showed Barbara Walters
3975200	3979760	going like, so under your pants, what's going on? And it was, I was kind of like, well, that's me.
3979760	3984000	That's me. That's, I thought I was being progressive by asking all the details. I was
3984000	3988080	like, Oh no, that doesn't make any sense. Why would I do that? And it's like, I'm constantly
3988080	3992880	playing catch up. I always feel like, like, I just feel like this barbarian. I feel like this old,
3993200	3998800	like sad gorilla at the zoo. That's just like keeps crushing kittens. They bring to it
4000400	4004000	because it's replacing one that knows sign language, but I just, like, I just keep,
4004000	4008400	I just keep asking for ice cream and killing. That's okay. Every zoo needs his gorilla that
4008400	4012640	kills kittens. You know what I mean? You know how many fucking extra kittens they have at the zoo?
4012640	4017600	You have no idea. It's a real problem. Well, New York still comes out of our tax dollars,
4017600	4022560	guys, feeding those kittens. I'm not paying for that shit. That's why we were killing them.
4023520	4026240	You're already drunk on absence, aren't you? I don't know what I'm drunk on,
4026240	4030960	but that shit's fucking dangerous. I seriously feels like I could have just taken like a shot
4030960	4038240	of fucking golf, like, you know, 87, whatever. Yeah. What's a fuel? Like 88, nine. I like that
4038240	4044240	you went back to the seventies for gas station. Is golf, is golf not a thing anymore? No, golf's
4044240	4049120	a fucking thing, guys. Fuck you. Golf still exists. Fuck you. I'll tell you right now,
4049120	4055200	I don't drink from fucking BP spouts. Am I right? Huh? Yeah. Don't, don't, don't support that.
4055200	4060480	Don't support it. See, you got to get in the crowd on my side. No, yeah. Those sons of bitches.
4060480	4068640	Yeah. I'm like good gas, like Exxon. The good people over at Exxon. They don't kill fucking
4068640	4073600	dolphins and shit. They just fucking make my SUV hum. You're a standard oil guy from way back.
4073600	4078720	I'm a big standard oil man. That's why I hate these, that's why I hate these filtered cigarettes
4078720	4085360	nonsense. I wanted to filter. I wanted to fucking, you like your lucky strikes. I like my Paul moles,
4085360	4091120	my lucky strikes, my Virginia Slims wide. I like my Virginia Slims. That's hard to get.
4092800	4097520	I like my Virginia wide unfiltered. You guys too young for that shit.
4098080	4100800	How does a host move from one topic to another?
4101040	4103600	I don't know.
4106240	4112080	Music. Yo, yo, yo. Host wrap. Yo, yo, yo. I'm going to moderate discussion.
4112080	4115360	Gonna fuck your mama so hard to give her a concussion. Give us some.
4118560	4121200	That was good. You were, you were, you were. Listen, I'm going to tell you right now,
4121200	4124480	if I knew how to go from one thing to another, I might've gotten the job.
4125520	4130080	The wrong guy to ask. But you want, you, you want, I'm actually just kind of curious. I don't know.
4130160	4134160	I'm not curious. I decided at some point that I was, that the angle was going to be that I was
4134160	4138080	going to get advice from you on how to be a good host. But obviously that's not, that's not what's
4138080	4142080	organically pleasing. It's stupid. And I'm clinging to it. All you have to do is to give
4142080	4147120	me the advice to go with the flow. Just hold on. Just be yourself. If you're this dude,
4147120	4152000	so fucking likable, right? If he's just himself. Yeah. Here's the thing. And I don't, I want to
4152000	4156720	take a moment. I want to take a moment. Just, just think about 9 11 for a second. All right,
4156720	4162320	cool. Now I'm just moving on to the host thing. I like this. No, I'm saying like the balls. The
4162320	4166640	whole point is, is like, if people always make an adjustment, cause they're on TV,
4166640	4170240	people always make an adjustment. They're like, Oh, do that. Now I gotta be Dan Horman on TV. No.
4170240	4173520	If you do that, you're going to feel like a weird version of yourself. Just be you,
4173520	4177120	just be you. You know, I mean, maybe dress like a, you know, adult, but other than that,
4180240	4185840	just be you dude. I mean, don't fuck around. Don't fuck with fucking you. This is why there's
4185840	4189840	people here. Like in other words, people like you. And I feel like if you try, I learned that
4191360	4194800	back, I was doing a show back in like with Sammy Davis Jr. A couple of years ago. And
4197040	4200240	it was just a small jazz number. It was a little jazz number. You may have heard of it. It was
4200240	4208960	called white nights. Um, it was me and Gregory Hines and, um, barishikov. You were the third
4208960	4215040	white David's drop by to just check in to make sure my moves were right. Yeah. A lot of people
4215040	4220000	don't know that I played the baby. Yeah. Yeah. There's a scene where barishikov's walking
4220000	4227920	through Lincoln center and there's a lady older than a baby. That was me. Yeah. Yeah. Netflix.
4227920	4233360	It guys is grateful for one guy that knows Gregory Hines fucking that and, and, and leapers. Can you
4233360	4239360	tapers jumpers? Yeah, I can. I don't want to do it here. What? Okay. I will. All right. Now show
4239360	4244080	me one tap step. You know, I don't know any tap steps, but if you gave me tap shoes, I better crush
4244160	4249360	it for real. I don't feel like I need, I feel like tap dancing is a dance. It's just in my blood.
4250480	4256240	I feel like Italians and Jews have always dominated tap tap has been our fucking all crap. I can't
4256240	4259920	think of the times I've gone to Italian restaurant where there wasn't an Italian guy tap dancing.
4260880	4269040	Just some Italian guy with an accordion. Oh, who's got time for this? That's the most important
4269040	4276080	thing. It's a lot of people think it's about the feet. It's not Peter just tapping the fucking
4276080	4284560	arms. It was your favorite Italian tap dancer. Oh, it's gotta be Giovanni. I mean, whose feet
4284560	4291120	move like, but they called him old stone foot, which was his terrible name because he had fucking
4291120	4296560	the wonderful feet. Well, but they were referring to the strength of the tap. Okay. It wasn't about
4296560	4301280	weight for him. It was like, it was like, wow. Every time every step he takes is like permanent.
4301280	4305760	Yes. And, and, and, and, and, and heavy. That's true. They used to say in Italian,
4305760	4310240	it sounds beautiful. They said, but in Johnny, which means you know, he tapped there.
4310240	4317360	That's what that means. There's a little fucking dead in the Piazza. Every Piazza in Southern
4317360	4322640	Napoli has a little dent in it. There's an urban legend about, about, about Giovanni
4322640	4332400	that, that he, I mean, it is true that he, I see. I know you're gonna say it. I think it's,
4332400	4337040	I think this is absolutely apocryphal, but go on. Well, I mean, but it is true that he was at the
4337040	4343760	Yalta conference when he was, he's right behind stone. Well, but it was, he was there as a performer,
4343760	4347520	but they, the, the, the, the urban legend, because I don't actually believe this is possible,
4347520	4352640	but that he, he did, did a dance for them. And at the end of every Italian tap dance,
4352640	4357680	if you do it the Italian way, there's always, it's, it's called the, the final tap.
4357680	4360480	No, it's like, it's like a salad with tomatoes and mozzarella.
4361440	4364080	It's called a Cabrazio. I know what you're talking about.
4366080	4366960	I love a Cabrazio.
4366960	4372160	It's Chubacci, Cabrese, Cubacci, which is the tap, the tap to end the tap.
4372720	4378400	Um, or the tap of all taps. Right. So he went, he tapped with a tutti tapping.
4380240	4387840	The urban legend is that his was so hard that it, it vibrated, uh, Stalin, uh,
4387840	4394400	it turned him into a Democrat. That's true for 10 minutes. That's true. But then he forgot all of
4394400	4399360	Marx's teachings. He went right back and broke the, uh, the, uh, the agreement on Poland and went
4399360	4403840	right back into it for 10 minutes though. I mean, that's, that's longer than any of us can tap.
4403840	4408080	Someone's political views out of their heart. And this is, this is going to seem like a really
4408080	4413360	bad pun, but this is just a historical fact. Give it a little bit of time. That lag, that 10 minutes
4413360	4418560	of lag is where they came up with the term Google lag. That's when people go to the Google log.
4418560	4423760	Oh boy. I told you it was going to seem like a bad bun. Um, but it's not. That's just a historical
4423760	4434080	fact. Are you stalling? Are you stalling for time? I'm Hitler and then with my greatest Hitlers.
4434880	4444560	Um, these are my greatest Hitlers. Oh, you kicked me in my soul. I really, I really, I really, I,
4444560	4451600	I don't, I don't, so many Falklands, so many of just trying to do some shit. I, I, I, so many,
4451600	4458640	many, many, many fucking Rhineland where the whole war started over fucking Rhineland guys.
4459200	4463040	What is your stance over the Falklands? Yeah. You know what? Fucking take them, leave them,
4463040	4470720	I don't give a shit. You guys, you know me with the Falklands. I give a fuck. You know what I mean?
4471440	4477360	That was the Jewish, that was the Jewish mom. Maybe it's the, who needs the, who needs the worry.
4477520	4484560	Call me when it's one Falkland, like a Republic, the Falkland Republic. It's like, what is it?
4484560	4488480	Like, like, like, we would pick one and then, and then get your shit together and then we'll
4488480	4493040	invade you instead of the fucking British. By the way, 15 years ago, there was a great Peter
4493040	4498400	Fox joke to be made, but with this crowd, it'll never go. No, never. Pretend it's 1982.
4500960	4504880	Give us your Peter Fox joke. Have you guys ever take UCB 1982?
4504880	4508080	You ever take, it's fucking, it gets you really high. It's a really good class.
4509840	4517120	Yeah, that's my Harold group. Peter, Peter, they get really mad when you fuck with the UCB, man.
4517120	4520640	They're like, yo, bro, east side fucking shit. Well, we're in there. It's like, oh,
4520640	4527200	they were taking a shit out of UCB. It's like, you can't get it across town. You come here.
4527200	4533520	I get it. Don't worry about it. I take Viagra. I get it. See, uh, said I can't get a Cialis
4533520	4537360	prescription. You get, you understand. You guys know what I'm talking about. There's a lot.
4537360	4543760	Yeah. A lot, a lot of, a lot of my fan. I don't like saying my fans because it feels,
4543760	4547440	but I don't want to talk about that, but, but, uh, I don't know how to quickly say, well,
4547440	4552160	a lot of my fans are, seem to be, uh, punsters. Like they like puns and I find it very, very
4552160	4557040	uncomfortable. Really? That's the best group of fans to have people who understand horrible
4557040	4561600	things. Okay. So in other words, you know, when a comedy writer's room, and this is a weird thing,
4562080	4567920	is like in a comedy writer's room, sometimes the worst version of a joke is the funniest thing in
4567920	4571040	the room. Do you know what I'm talking about? Well, I mean, you go to that place, you would never
4571040	4575520	put it on the show. Yeah, but never a, well, I mean, you must be suggesting, I feel like,
4575520	4581120	do you have a daily show story about how a pun, I could think of one. There's loads of puns on
4581120	4584560	that. Well, you guys always connected everything on the mortise or whatever you call it over,
4584560	4588640	John shoulder, but those are technically puns. Yeah. And they're good. They're good. It's word
4588640	4593680	play. We used to do the, like the Ted Kazarinsky thing, you know what I'm talking about. Tim Kazarinsky,
4593680	4598000	remember the written to influenza that keep on knocking, but you can't come in fluenza.
4599920	4604640	I mean, once that shit opened up, once that, so, uh, there was a guy in Saturday Night Live,
4604640	4610720	he was a writer, um, Google him, seems Kazarinsky. It's Tim, right? Yeah. Okay. He was on the cast
4610720	4615120	for a while. Yeah. He was on the cast. So he cast, but he cast, we call him. But wasn't it the
4615120	4620720	Dick Ebersol years, the Dick Ebersol years? I think it might've been with, uh, yeah, like, uh,
4620720	4626880	second city guy in a very good cast. So try to explain that because once you open that wormhole
4626880	4631680	of bad jokery, you will, and it's great juke jokery in the beginning. And then it just takes.
4631680	4635200	But there's a point that the influencer one is how like, I got, I remember being a little kid,
4635200	4639680	I was a kid during the Ebersol years, Martin Short also Ebersol. And yeah. And so like,
4639680	4645040	what's his face from, uh, from, um, uh, w w all the 16 candle movies and shit. What's his name?
4645040	4652080	Uh, very good. Yeah. And, uh, and, uh, the, uh, Elaine and Robert Downey Jr.
4652080	4658400	Elaine from Seinfeld, Brad Hall, Gary Kroger, who can forget the k-rogue. Um, no, Rich Hall, Rich Hall,
4658400	4663280	Sniglets. But the weird thing is that I actually learned comedy from that season because that was
4663280	4667920	when I was sort of going through comedy puberty in that it was like all of a sudden I went to combine
4667920	4674720	comedy and puberty into one word. Um, the, well, the puberty, throw it to a room and take the
4674720	4681360	terrible one. And then, uh, that that's your process. The, the, the, the, the, it's, everybody
4681360	4685200	goes like, oh, that was, you know, the terrible, but it's like, it doesn't, did you ever hear this
4685200	4688800	about SNL that they go, everybody thinks that SNL was perfect of the year they were 10 and
4688800	4693360	everybody thinks that it's currently in some kind of slump. Yes. Except if it came up right now,
4693360	4697760	they'd be like, did you see fucking, uh, and they'd be right because it's all 12.
4697760	4701520	I always say 12. Yeah. Yeah. 12. You're like sixth grade. That's like 12, right? Sixth to eighth
4701520	4705200	grade. It's the fucking best show ever. When does he, when does your ass get rock hard?
4705200	4709360	Mine? Is that 12? Mine? I'm, I'm still waiting. I'm still waiting. Because I remember that's what
4709360	4712960	it was. I remember I was watching, I was watching Ed grimly and he was going, I must say, and I was
4712960	4717440	like, whoa, my ass is really hard. Yeah. And that's really funny. Why was your ass rock hard?
4717440	4724160	I was a non sequitur kind of weird pedophile joke. I was like, like, I, like, I have a mnemonic device
4724160	4728160	for how to remember a 12 year old. I don't think there's anything weird about talking about 12 year
4728160	4733120	old asses. Okay. Maybe I'm in the fucking minority here. I'm trying to get your back here,
4733120	4738400	bro. I don't know how to get out of this one. But that's all I did. I mean, you're a couple of years
4738400	4741600	younger than me. What do you think about the bit where I whispered with the mic to my mouth? Does
4741600	4746160	that work? I don't know. I do that. I feel like that's negating the whole whisper, the whole point
4746160	4749760	of the way. Don't ask, don't, don't, don't ask for my input. You're, you're, you're, you're, you're.
4749760	4753280	Why is he, why is he not the host? He's already a better host. He should host, he should host
4753280	4757920	Harmontown. It's just not appropriate because, you know, it's the name and time to explain the
4757920	4763200	show. There's a time machine involved. Dan's got fucking spent all of his hard earned money. Oh,
4763200	4766560	this is the premise of the show. Actually, he spent all of it. He spent all of his hard earned
4766560	4771280	money inventing a time machine. You go, wow. So we can solve the world's problems. Nope.
4771280	4775440	So we can host a talk show with people from history. That's the only thing and solve the
4775440	4779440	world's problems. Hopefully by getting, by talking to people from history, but he could go back in
4779440	4784560	time. Hey, Rich, can you, can you hear me? What if he can't, this is a terrible, terrible theater.
4784560	4789040	Terrible. But he might not be here, but he's there. Rich, can you answer me one question?
4789680	4795760	Which course is the executive producer, everybody? So is it? And, uh, well also former daily show
4795760	4799840	producer, he's sort of like run comments on the rich course and you should clap. Rich,
4799840	4804080	ladies, if you'd like, you said it was okay to talk about the show. Is it okay to, to tell him
4804080	4812400	who the cast is? Okay. So, so like Robert Smigel is playing Albert Einstein and, uh, and, and Rory
4812400	4818960	is playing, uh, Benjamin Franklin and, uh, nice dude. Fucking perfect use of the fart in order.
4818960	4824400	Somebody took UCB level four. Fart in order. That guy's seven grand into his first workshop.
4825120	4828400	His parents are in the back. They're like, worth every penny, Jared.
4828400	4833120	Totally worth it. Four classes.
4835680	4843600	He has a green belt in fart. He's not an OT yet. Just keep spending. At some point you'll be in a
4843600	4849360	movie. At the, at the end of the level five workshop, they take you to a room where Matt Besser
4849360	4854880	has written in a notebook that improv is, uh, it was created by horses. He's referencing,
4855600	4861200	he's referencing Scientology assholes. You're spending into a system that won't help you get
4861200	4867600	out while you can. Seriously though, folks, how about fucking Scientology? Seriously. I do. I
4867600	4871680	don't want to be un-inertaining Lee, uh, sycophantic, but I, I do feel like I want to add a footnote
4871680	4877760	that I don't, I, I like, like, I'm very happy that UCB had us here and I, and I do, I do their shows
4877760	4882080	all the time. I was like, I, I, I have a great time with their wonderful people. They've changed
4882080	4888560	the landscape of Los Angeles. Polar is Elrond Hubbard. So we have two different views on this.
4889120	4896560	Two different views. Polar believes aliens created improv. Better Elrond Hubbard than UNICEF, right?
4898080	4903600	Xeon. What's his name? Xenu is the gray. Have you guys been to the Xenu marathon,
4903600	4911200	the Xenu improv marathon? It's 24 hours of Xenu improv. You can't, don't miss it. Rob
4911200	4916800	Riggle just fucking crushes it. Do you think it's, they put a volcano on the cover of Dianetics. I
4916800	4920960	was just looking at one of the, in LA we have probably more billboards for, for shit than you
4920960	4926880	do. In LA people are like, that sounds good. In New York is like, get the fuck out of my way.
4927680	4934160	Today a lady tried to give me a thing. No one in LA walks. That's a fair, that's a fair observation.
4934160	4936720	But in New York, when you walk down the street, people always try to hand you shit,
4937280	4940000	right? How many people in here have ever been like, oh yes, I'd like that.
4940640	4944720	You're like, get the fuck out of my way. It always makes me think, again, an airplane,
4944720	4948000	like when you just fucking snap people's necks, you know, the guy's walking to the airport and
4948000	4951200	it's like, how are you, Christian? She's just fucking killing people. That's what I want to do.
4951200	4955760	Like, do you know that the dolphins, I'm like, crack, you know, I like dolphins. I just want to
4955760	4960400	kill that lady. You know what I mean? I will then go home and donate to the dolphin cause. I'm
4960400	4963760	all for the cause. It's just her talking to me on the streets. You wish there was a way to
4963760	4970080	accidentally eat her with a sandwich. Yes, exactly. It's really her. I, sometimes humans
4970080	4976480	ruin it for the dolphins, I guess is what I'm saying guys. Well, that's, yeah, in addition
4976480	4981520	to loving puns and generally being atheist, uh, my audience, uh, who I love very much, uh,
4981520	4986320	what you're really scared of losing them, huh? Uh, I love them. I love them. And I made a lot
4986320	4991280	of caveats. I made them dinner. They're young. They're cool. Yeah. The greatest. However,
4991920	4996080	however, now you know the answer, why he got the job. Cause he has like followers and I keep
4996080	5001520	being like, how about this? You guys are all fucking losers. And then they're like, you know
5001520	5006880	what you're doing? You're alienating the crap, but they're fucking, you're not even, you're not
5006880	5011440	developing those dots. That's developing a group of people who were interested in what you have to
5011440	5017120	say. Cause they're all, that might be an important thing to have been said to me. I didn't, I didn't
5017200	5022400	connect. Well, I'm obsessed with like not, I think cause I, I, I like, I, I have a terrible,
5022400	5027680	terrible like fear of like that at any minute, everyone's going to go like you're now you're
5027680	5031760	in, you're, you're out and it doesn't, it's not going to happen. But it's not a logic based thing.
5031760	5035360	So it's like, it's an emotional thing. So like, you know, the reason gay people don't like being
5035360	5039920	called fags is not because they're like, am I, am I up? How'd we get, how'd we get to here?
5040480	5044240	I feel like we were all with you. And then you're like, that's why fags are fags. It's like, wait,
5044240	5049280	what? I think you misheard me. You're like, that's why the Jews fucking run the economy.
5049280	5053440	You know, I was like, wow, hold on. That's, that's how they all do it. Dan, that's how we
5053440	5058240	run. We have latent like, like, like memories of like the first time we were ever genuinely
5058240	5063280	terrified that it was possible to be excommunicated basically from the, from the monkey tree, um,
5063280	5068400	and lose our figs and lose our ability to, to, to, to be, we would start fires like prime,
5068400	5073520	primates die on the 1835. You just wanted all the fires started. We never, we never got,
5073520	5077920	but you are right. It's like a little, it's like, yeah, it's an obsession with me. Like it's, it's,
5077920	5082080	it's like, like, I really always want to, like, I want to, I want to endear myself and, and it's,
5082080	5086800	it's a little wasted sometimes because like, look at me. I look like somebody that hates everybody.
5086800	5090160	But that's why you're charming. I probably do hate everybody. Can I give us, can I,
5090160	5093600	we give you a minute just for Dan. Stop sticking up for me because that makes me, uh,
5094560	5099840	I want to stick up for Dan. Dan is the fucking definition of the fucking dude.
5099840	5106640	You're like the guy, and here's the joke about it. Dan is the fucking definition of a fucking dude.
5106640	5112400	Yeah. You know what the dude is? You've seen, you know the dude. He's the dude. It's like the thing
5112400	5117760	we're like, he doesn't know he's cool, which is why we're all like, you're fucking cool. You know
5117760	5120880	what I mean? And then like, if the minute you're like, yeah, you know what, everything I do say,
5120880	5125360	it makes sense. People are like, you're a dick. You know what I mean? You're not fooling me.
5125360	5129040	Cause I know I'm going to step off stage and go like, wait, what did he say? Uh, I haven't
5129040	5132880	listened at all. He just said, I was, I mean, then I was, I was a thing. You said your man,
5132880	5139760	you may or may not hate people. I do. Yeah. I do. I hate, I hate, I hate all of them.
5139760	5145040	Yeah. I mean, I mean, it's like, like money changes that a lot because it's like, it turns
5145040	5149440	into how much money you get from a sitcom. Let me just say this late night. Fucking,
5149440	5153280	I wear the same pants a lot. You know what I mean? I said, well, did you, I mean,
5153280	5157760	did you grew up poor, right? I mean, you grew up middle class. Yeah. Like lower middle class.
5157840	5161600	I'm telling you, if I farted like that, my dad wouldn't have been like, I'm proud of him.
5162800	5169680	Get a fucking job. Um, yeah. You make more than washing a million dishes. Yeah. I just
5169680	5173040	mean, when you create a sitcom, like, did you come here and like the Dan Horman express,
5173040	5177600	like some fucking thing, no, but like zip line, do you zip line places? I guess. I don't,
5177600	5181520	I never do a place where I can zip line anywhere. I haven't gotten to the zip line phase yet.
5181520	5185200	You haven't. I, cause you know, like Chuck Laurie who created the two and a half men,
5185200	5189920	he zip lines all across America. That's a true story. No, he, could he fly?
5191920	5196960	Yes. Does he choose to apply? He has a series of, he has a series of wires and he just
5196960	5200800	series of wires. He leaves, he leaves warning, but higher than the poor people can see. He leaves
5200800	5206880	warning brothers. It's out of poor vision. Poor people can only see one mile because of
5206880	5214160	malnutrition because you guys think you don't enjoy carrots supply guys because of the food supply.
5214160	5220800	You can only see one mile into the sky. Fucking Chuck Laurie mile and a half city. It's like the
5220800	5226480	Ewok village, but it's just, it's just show creators up there guys. The late night people
5226480	5231680	we've, I once was invited to like a party at one house, but like the fucking gods who create the
5231680	5235280	shit, they like fucking zip line all over. If you say, if Chuck Laurie comes over to your house,
5235280	5238400	he said, you want to write home? He's like, no, I'm good. And he walks, he climbs a tree,
5238400	5243680	throws his belt over the fucking thing. Yeah. Here's what's weird. Why would he have to
5243680	5248480	climb a tree? You know what I mean? Like without much money, but he prefers it because he feels
5248480	5253840	like any pussy can get a fucking ride. You know what I mean? What do you mean? How would you,
5253840	5258080	how would you get up? I don't know. Fucking zip line escalator. I don't know. I don't,
5258080	5262960	that's why I don't have a fucking sitcom. You know what I mean? The late night world is just
5262960	5268160	fucking, um, a powered walkways like at the airport. Spencer, if, if you can have one zip
5268160	5272560	line from one, one location to another location, like it could be from your house to a certain
5272560	5276000	restaurant. You're like for one place to another. It could be anywhere across the planet. You can
5276000	5285280	go from dungeons to dragons. That's the most distance you're going to. Where would you zip
5285280	5290080	line from? And if you had one zip line that was always available to you. Definitely started in
5290080	5300320	Baton Rouge. A fine choice. Then you got like a fucking basket full of crawfish. You're like,
5300320	5308240	I'm zip line. I'm zip line into Canada. Okay. They'll appreciate this. Nobody, nobody will
5308240	5314400	dispute, nobody will dispute your choice to start in Baton Rouge. Where is your destination? I was,
5314400	5325520	I was going to say Toronto. You can't get, you can bring, you can bring jazz and crawfish to the
5325520	5337920	north. Hey guys, I got loads of crud daddies, but I could also use some Greek fruit and Toronto.
5337920	5343280	Everybody's so busy trying to be better than each other. No one's focused on where would I be really
5343280	5351120	useful in a way that's attainable? Be the seafood king of Toronto. Be its primary supplier of
5351120	5357040	shellfish. I also like the sub-economy of zip line, uh, wire transfer guys. We're up to sit up at the
5357040	5362000	zip lines and be like, where are you headed? You know what I mean? I think they're like Chuck
5362000	5365440	Lori. They're like Chuck Lori, you got to wait. The guys who created Cheers are ahead of you. You
5365440	5369520	know what I mean? Like they're on their way to Florida. Starting point destination. Where's your
5369520	5374080	starting point destination? How far does zip line go? It could go all the way around the world if
5374080	5378480	you'd like. The whole world. Yeah. Not the moon. It should be. But the moon's not in the world. I
5378560	5386400	don't want to be a dick. I love that. Anywhere in America except the moon. I know we put a flag in
5386400	5393920	it, but we don't own it. It could be Istanbul. It could be Saigon. It could be, uh, Brisbane. It
5393920	5401440	could be wherever you like. You just named places. Um, I would say it's, I mean, I would start in New
5401440	5406000	York just cause that's where I live. Okay. So you start here. I would go to. You only get one zip
5406000	5410880	line. You could zip any way you want. I thought I got to live there forever. No, you can zip back
5410880	5415200	and forth. Oh, but I can't like zip to multiple though. Okay. No, you get one. I'm saying you get
5415200	5420960	one zip line. Start like, that's a really good question. Spencer, very controversially picked
5420960	5429040	Baton Rouge and Toronto. Very, very pragmatically. Yeah. London, by the way, the internet's fucking
5429040	5433760	shit's trending right now. Oh, that's, that's such a Reddit answer. It's like, I figured it out.
5434720	5440560	This is the best way to use a zip line. I will have $8 million in three years.
5444240	5448160	And then 900 guys questioning it, but then just watching like a top Reddit that is just,
5448160	5452880	if the original poster is just like, chop, chop, chop all the peer review. Well, actually,
5452880	5460800	wasn't that actually, no fucking do your math. Do your math. I love the idea. I love the,
5460800	5465280	I love the trend. It would have gone good there right now that it's just like, it's like, it's
5465280	5470320	like Toronto, Spencer question mark. Like you're in a boy band. You know what I mean? So Rory,
5470320	5475440	he's starting in New York. You starting in New York, starting in New York. You get to zip to one
5475440	5481040	place. I would probably zip to like Brazil zip. That's a whole fucking country. I know. But where's
5481040	5484560	the place where all those fucking titties are mountain. You know what I mean? That's all I know
5484560	5493200	about. No, bouncy titties. The fact that you can't name a city in Brazil. I mean, you're not
5493200	5501120	qualified. You want a zip line to Rio de Janeiro. I understand that Rio is such a fucked up place
5501120	5505200	that rich people have to travel via air from building to building and shit. They can't call
5505200	5510720	it zip lines. So what I'm saying is I would fucking zip into Rio fucking zip up some Rio
5510720	5515760	titties and then I'd zip out. No, because you have a zip line, I get it guys. Pretty controversial.
5515760	5522160	So human trafficking, you'd use. Hey, hey, you know what? How the ladies get there. So I'm a
5522160	5527200	problem. I just use zip money. Don't know where it came from. You understand? I have enough money
5527200	5531200	for a zip line. You don't worry about the fucking root of the problem. I'm disturbed by the fact
5531200	5538400	zip lines, don't human traffic humans, human traffic. Exactly. Guys, you don't make enough
5538400	5542800	money to zip line to worry about your peasant problems. You know what I mean? Dan, zip line
5542800	5548320	start and destination. Well, start's tough because you guys are... It's real, Dan. You're questioning,
5548320	5553200	I mean. We make Alia. You get to pick two places. You could live in Los Angeles. You could live in
5553200	5558000	New York, but you could have a zip line between two other destinations that you have at your leisure
5558000	5562560	to zip back and forth. You just take off your belt, throw it over the wire and go zoom and you're
5562560	5567520	fucking... Why can't there be a more comfortable way to go? I don't want to be a drag. Can't there
5567520	5572960	be a first-class zip? I don't want to use my belt. I think you have a belt that you just james
5572960	5577840	by the... That's it? Yeah. Because I just want to be a dick, but bad roots, it's a rattle. That's
5577840	5581920	a lot of belt holding. Yeah. Yeah, you didn't specify that. I feel like you just get the man
5581920	5587520	in a chair. My hands are getting tired. I guarantee. There's no wrong way to zip. I feel
5587520	5593520	like by the time I'm in New Jersey, I'm dead. I can't carry a basket of crap. My fingers are
5593520	5599120	bleeding. I'm exhausted. I'm sitting on a stool right now. Let's not get hung up on how you zip
5599120	5604080	line. You're talking about a rope here. This isn't a zip line at all. You're talking about
5604080	5608960	like different... You're talking about bank robbers. That's a different kind of zip line.
5609840	5616000	Oh, the belt is... Yeah, the belt is an ad hoc zip line. Yeah, this is a comfort class kind of
5616000	5619120	a thing. This is a comfort class kind of a thing. If you want to go to one place to another easily,
5619920	5623920	starting where... This is a theme park grade zip line. I'm talking about like you're sitting in
5623920	5629040	a Shaw Walker chair. Can I ask one more question? Certainly. Before I make my decision.
5629040	5637280	Yes, the best of the furious franchise. Can we assume that there's such a thing as a
5638480	5648480	cargo capacity? Could I travel? Can I pretend he needs his dog to fly? You get 500 pounds cargo.
5649440	5653520	500 pounds. Okay. Portland. Oregon. Okay, starting or ending?
5654240	5659040	I'm going there. The question is... You get a starting location and an ending location.
5659040	5663680	It's a one-way zip line. Oh, you can't. You have to walk back. It's elevation-based.
5664560	5670800	You have to zip down. You have to take a Peter Pan bus home. That's the only caveat.
5671520	5674720	That's why I said Chuck Lauren had to climb a tree. You get a one-way zip line and then Peter Pan
5674720	5679920	home. Hey, it's called zip line, bro. I can live it or live it or don't. You know what I mean?
5679920	5682000	Hey, I'm not Chuck Laurie. I didn't invent this shit.
5684000	5685520	That's why Chuck Laurie had to climb a tree.
5685520	5690480	Blame Chuck Laurie, bro. That's why he's got a half a man on that show.
5690480	5696400	You get to start to play a zip line. Boom. You go... It's like James Bond. You're at the end of the place.
5696400	5699920	So then I'm picking a place that I want to be able to get in a hurry.
5701360	5704480	You get to communicate between two places. So Portland, is it starting or the
5704480	5708160	ending? If you're in LA, I'll give you an example. If you're in LA and you want to zip
5708160	5716320	line to Portland, it'll take you only like 37 hours holding a belt one and a half miles in the air.
5716320	5720640	So it's a pretty good way to travel to walk your dogs. Because I was just thinking,
5720640	5724160	Portland, my dogs are about Portland, but it's like, wait a minute. We just have to hold on
5724160	5731040	two sides of a belt for 32 hours and hold your body weight up with no other harnesses.
5731040	5732640	Why are you being such a pussy, Dan?
5735520	5738720	It's like you hate traveling. Why do you hate traveling so much, Dan?
5740000	5745520	You don't want to go to Portland, bro? Whatever. Hey guys, if I was the host, I'd go to Portland.
5746880	5752320	By the way, I hold my shit up for 32 hours to entertain you people, not this guy.
5754320	5758880	What? What's going on? Spencer did not hesitate. I'm Baton Rouge in Toronto.
5758880	5762720	But we praised him for that only because of the assumption about a two-way...
5762720	5766640	Oh no, that's not... I was belt traveled. He thought it was zipline.
5766640	5768640	He said, just fucking don't get hung up on the belt.
5768640	5772160	I was talking about ropes. The belt's a big factor here.
5772160	5773200	Oh, I mean, I...
5773200	5774880	From Portland to where else? Where else?
5774880	5779600	Well, I retract Portland because I wanted to have like a pieta tear there where my dogs could play.
5781360	5783920	Dude, you zipline with a couple of dogs is pretty awesome.
5783920	5788800	Does he have to hold the doors or do the dogs hold their own belt?
5788800	5789920	He's got baby thorns.
5790720	5792800	I'm allowing his zipline 500 pounds.
5792800	5798480	You put like a fucking bacon kong on the end of a belt and a dog just holds on.
5799360	5801520	But you're saying it's elevation based.
5801520	5802560	I'm not saying that. I'm saying...
5802560	5803120	I am.
5803120	5807280	You get to zipline from wherever. We might have to build a large tower so you can zipline
5807280	5808560	so the elevation works.
5808560	5810000	Wow. LA to Tokyo.
5810640	5810960	Okay.
5810960	5811600	Okay, let me finish.
5811760	5816560	I'm going to use the money I make bringing... What are they, like blue jeans?
5816560	5817200	Yeah, blue jeans.
5817200	5818800	What's their crawdad?
5818800	5821360	They love blue jeans and catalogs. You should bring a Cadillac.
5822480	5824240	You can zipline a couple of caddies.
5824240	5824880	They love cybers.
5824880	5827520	I build another zipline from Mount Flinchy to LA.
5828560	5829680	Mount Fuji.
5829680	5831600	Wait, you're going only for mercenary reasons?
5831600	5832080	Yeah.
5832080	5832720	You're going for a zipline?
5832720	5833840	You mean merchandising?
5833840	5834240	Yeah.
5834240	5836080	Mercenary would be like, he's going to kill Japanese people.
5836080	5837440	No, all right.
5837440	5839120	Oh, I'm a fucking merc!
5839120	5840480	She just comes ziplining and then kills...
5841200	5844160	I mean, back in the 40s, that was the move, you know what I mean?
5844160	5845120	But now, nobody wanted to kill the Japanese people.
5845120	5848560	I could use the word salarian, but you're going for financial interest?
5848560	5849840	Mercenary is what I meant, by the way.
5851600	5855200	Again, mercenary, I feel like that kind of tastes bloodshed.
5856080	5858000	Well, I think you're perpetuating, first of all,
5858000	5862800	the myth that it's possible to kill a Japanese person, which we found out.
5862800	5863680	Which we learned.
5863680	5864960	We fucking learned in a hard way.
5864960	5867040	Without a lot of big weapons, it is very difficult.
5867040	5869680	I think the Bataan Death March taught us a lesson or two on that.
5869920	5872480	By the way, nothing worse than the Bataan...
5872480	5874000	Don't owe me on that, fucking but...
5874000	5877600	Don't get mixed up between the Bataan Death March and the Bataan Dime March,
5877600	5878240	which is when...
5879360	5880800	Guys, it's a callback.
5880800	5882720	UNICEF, UNICEF, everybody.
5882720	5887920	I know, honestly, well, because once you guys told me about the limitations,
5887920	5890960	where it's only one way, they're asleep at this point.
5890960	5893440	And we're just like, how much were we...
5893440	5897840	Who's just pumping fucking, you know, whatever LSD into the crowd right now.
5898720	5899200	Just...
5901360	5906480	I'm obsessed with the idea that I need to overcome the limitations that I'm being fenced in by,
5906480	5910480	because I'm thinking like, isn't Mount Fuji the highest elevated point?
5911280	5912240	Somewhere outside...
5912240	5916640	The point is that you can't zipline up hills, so you could start in a Fuji, but you can't.
5916640	5917120	I can't.
5917120	5918080	But I'm saying, if my ending...
5918080	5919680	You're talking about Chuck Lorre!
5919680	5920960	He can zipline a pill!
5921760	5923440	I'm not thinking about who invented this!
5923440	5926480	Chuck Lorre uses two ziplines, one for each way.
5926560	5928800	Whatever Chuck Lorre goes, anywhere he wants to go.
5929680	5932080	You guys are putting way too many parameters on ziplining.
5932080	5935040	I am a good host, and here's proof we're moving on.
5935040	5935520	All right.
5935520	5936320	Oh, shit.
5937440	5938720	That's a perfect segue.
5941760	5944960	By the way, the crowd applauds for moving on, that means it's...
5946800	5948000	They're like, they're moving on?
5948800	5950800	Does that mean we can go home soon?
5952080	5953680	I just want to go home now.
5953680	5958320	I do just want to add that since I don't want to waste a zipline,
5958320	5962320	my starting point would be wherever atheism was invented,
5962320	5965120	and I would take it to wherever Reddit is headquartered.
5965120	5965840	Wow.
5965840	5972320	But I'm not doing that for approval.
5972320	5973200	Zipline effect.
5975280	5975840	All right.
5975840	5977840	Next topic, Jews.
5977840	5978080	Yes.
5979200	5981120	Finally, the reason I came.
5982080	5983840	Do they exist?
5983840	5984340	Yes.
5985520	5991520	Have you seen the Jew footage from Hancock Park?
5991520	5992160	I saw it.
5992160	5994160	Is that a guy in a suit?
5994160	5995120	It's blurry.
5995120	5995760	We don't know.
5997120	5998320	Also, I hate when people shoot...
5999520	6000320	Vertical.
6000320	6002400	Yeah, vertical, iPhone, on the way.
6002400	6007040	By the way, if you see someone, a policeman shooting a black guy,
6007040	6007680	please shoot it.
6007680	6009680	Landscape it, motherfuckers.
6009760	6013760	He's not going to kill another black guy above him.
6014560	6016320	That's the one place you know you don't...
6016320	6021120	Either way, I have to watch this killing on a fucking HGTV.
6021120	6021440	This is...
6021440	6022800	I'm not a pauper.
6022800	6025040	I zipline to Best Buy for my shit.
6026320	6027440	What do you think I am?
6027440	6028080	Yeah.
6028080	6028400	I'm going to have a little olive oil.
6028400	6031600	If we go to war with mole men or helicopter people...
6031600	6032960	Landscape it, fucking vertical.
6032960	6034160	Dude, landscape it, guys.
6034160	6035680	Even if it's a black.
6036960	6037840	The point is...
6038800	6040800	Say it then. Say it then.
6040800	6041280	Say it.
6041280	6042400	All right, perfect time.
6042400	6043280	Perfect time to say it.
6043840	6045280	Listen, here's the reason I said that,
6045280	6047920	because I'm not scared of one black person who's in the UCB.
6048640	6049920	There, I said it.
6049920	6052720	Now, if we were at a mother kind of improv theater,
6052720	6055040	maybe it's frightened, but I've seen UCB blacks.
6055040	6055680	I can take them.
6057280	6057600	It's all...
6057600	6058640	What is he doing?
6060000	6062000	Yes, and I can beat them up.
6064800	6067280	Did you just challenge all UCB blacks to a fight?
6067280	6067840	Here's the thing.
6067840	6068800	If you put the lights on here,
6068800	6070960	there's probably two black dudes in this whole fucking theater.
6070960	6072960	And you think they're both physically weaker.
6072960	6074960	That's your problem, not my problem.
6074960	6077040	You should hang out with more black people, assholes.
6078160	6079360	I have a lot of black friends.
6079360	6081040	You're just not here because they know that it's Sunday.
6081040	6083280	Because you keep beating them up.
6083280	6085440	Because they're zip-lined at all sorts of cool places.
6086160	6087600	Because I'm friends with really rich blacks.
6087600	6088720	You went to Costco.
6088720	6089840	They're going to somewhere fun.
6089840	6090640	Yes, exactly.
6090640	6092240	These guys might hang out with all kinds of black people
6092240	6092800	that don't want to come to the show.
6092800	6094640	By the way, this is the thing that happens...
6094720	6095520	This is like a lot...
6096160	6097440	Younger crowds grown a lot.
6097440	6099280	They get really scared when you talk about shit.
6099280	6100400	That's like controversial.
6100400	6102480	Well, they get yelled at a lot.
6102480	6103520	They do get yelled at a lot.
6103520	6105040	That's not your fault.
6105040	6107120	You come from a generation of...
6107120	6108400	You can't say anything.
6108400	6109040	Which is great.
6109040	6111280	But I think it's better that we're all exactly the same.
6111280	6112160	They have to deal with more...
6112160	6113680	I think we should kill culture.
6113680	6114160	You know what I mean?
6114160	6116400	I think Applebee's should be culture.
6116400	6117120	That's what I think.
6119280	6120400	I think that Applebee...
6120400	6122320	I think Olive Garden should be Italian food.
6122320	6123120	That's what I think.
6123120	6124240	Speaking of culture...
6124240	6125520	White wash culture, guys.
6125520	6126400	That's a good call.
6126400	6127360	How do you segue?
6127360	6128320	He's fucking drinking.
6128320	6129040	Oh, no, don't.
6129600	6131280	I mean, because I'm telling you...
6131280	6132240	He's had half of it.
6132240	6132800	He's fine.
6132800	6134880	Because it'll hit you like a 20 minutes...
6135760	6137840	It hit him right before he started talking about black people.
6138960	6140240	No, I was...
6140240	6141200	This is all written.
6141200	6141840	It's just like...
6143440	6144640	I ran about black people.
6144640	6145680	I wrote this a week ago.
6145680	6147200	I was just thrilled to have an opportunity.
6150560	6151760	This seems like a good time.
6152400	6154240	Let's bring up my beautiful wife, Erin...
6154240	6157440	Not that her beauty is the thing that makes her valuable.
6158160	6159360	caveat time!
6160960	6162320	We're going to take that intro one more time.
6162320	6162800	Take two.
6162800	6163360	Take two.
6163360	6166080	Intro of your wife, take 20 minutes.
6166080	6166640	Take two.
6166640	6170800	Let's bring up my autonomous collaborator in marital life,
6172640	6177840	who often makes decisions that have nothing to do with things.
6178640	6181360	That always seem to make sense, even after the fact.
6181840	6183360	Erin McGathey!
6193360	6194160	Alright, finish the show.
6194160	6194720	Thanks for coming.
6196160	6196960	Does that mic work?
6196960	6197600	Hello, Erin.
6197600	6197920	Hi.
6197920	6198480	Hi, guys.
6201520	6202960	I've been having a good time and have not...
6202960	6205760	I don't know what our situation is in terms of...
6205760	6206640	Usually, there's a clock.
6206640	6207680	I'm sure it's midnight.
6207680	6208160	I got the clock.
6208160	6208720	We're close.
6208800	6212160	You think we're close to having to roll into playing?
6212160	6214560	Uh, we don't serve breakfast here, so we should go...
6215600	6218160	I just wanted to say, when Dave Chappelle comes to the company,
6218160	6219600	he says he'll be three in the morning.
6220320	6223280	Well, I mean, we don't want to get back into that area.
6228320	6230640	First of all, you've been sitting there for an hour and a half.
6230640	6233280	Do you get any little zingers up your sleeve?
6234720	6236080	My ass is hard as a rock.
6236080	6238560	Yeah, like a 12-year-old.
6239280	6242080	UCB Blacks is my favorite Herald team.
6245600	6249840	And I'd zipline into the Grand Canyon,
6249840	6253760	because it sounds like the zipline's pointless for travel and commerce.
6253760	6257200	But it would be cool to fly into the Grand Canyon.
6263760	6267440	That's why the show shouldn't have always been men the entire time.
6267440	6268880	I would arrange, like...
6268880	6272160	You know how you can ride a donkey up and down the Grand Canyon?
6272160	6273200	They're human beings.
6275200	6275840	No, no, no, no.
6275840	6277600	So some are donkeys. Some are actual donkeys.
6277600	6278080	Oh, okay.
6278640	6280000	I thought you were talking about...
6280000	6281840	I would ride a park ranger.
6281840	6283200	I forgot where the Grand Canyon is.
6283840	6284320	Never mind.
6285760	6288400	If I had a zipline, I would give my zipline to a donkey,
6288400	6289280	so he'd go up and down.
6290560	6291920	You want to drink this, too?
6291920	6292720	It's good.
6292720	6293360	I just want to take that.
6293360	6294640	I know it's good, but it's dangerous.
6294640	6299520	It's just twice as strong as vodka if it's like taking two drinks of vodka.
6299520	6300560	It's not that simple.
6300560	6301920	Jeff, correct me if I'm...
6301920	6302480	Correct me if I'm...
6302480	6303040	It is not.
6303840	6307600	It feels like I had just four sips of vodka.
6307600	6309680	I don't want to fight about this, and you do.
6309680	6310480	I'd love to.
6311840	6312240	Did you guys hit me there?
6312240	6313120	I won't let you.
6313120	6313620	Okay.
6314960	6318000	Jeff, I feel like you were insisting on that question,
6318000	6320160	because you really wanted someone to ask you, and no...
6320160	6320960	No, no, I just...
6321920	6324080	Oh, where would you, Jeff?
6325200	6331040	I'm sure Jeff has an answer that's like the piazza by the coliseum that knows me.
6332480	6334640	Where they make my special drink.
6334640	6335440	I would go...
6335440	6339280	I would make a zipline from your dad's house to Dan's mom's pussy.
6339280	6339840	Come on.
6339840	6341520	Don't pout.
6341520	6342480	Wait, does that mean...
6342480	6343200	Does that mean you...
6343840	6344400	Does that mean...
6344400	6345520	I heard the traffic.
6345520	6346960	I heard the traffic on that line.
6346960	6347760	I bet you had one.
6347760	6348880	I bet it was in Venice.
6349680	6352960	And you're like, they make the perfect Negroni there.
6352960	6356320	Dan, I honestly did not...
6356320	6356720	I did not have...
6356720	6360480	Guys, I don't want to be a dick, but I just looked at fucking Waze's zipline,
6360480	6362560	and the traffic to your mom's pussy is backed up.
6364240	6368560	Yeah, but a lot of people falsely report that to see if they can hack the system.
6368560	6372240	Every time I zipline into your mom's pussy, there's Chuck Loy's right in front of me
6372240	6373120	every fucking time.
6373120	6373920	Yeah.
6373920	6376480	Boy, that guy, he takes his time.
6376480	6379440	Are you ziplining from my dad's house because you're going to fuck my dad?
6379440	6379920	Oh!
6381680	6382560	I have a joke.
6382560	6387760	I think, in my mind, I've just fucked your dad, and I could refresh myself a little bit
6387760	6388880	of Dan's mom's pussy.
6390880	6393280	I didn't follow that, but not because you were a big...
6393280	6395680	For the record, I approve of everything he just said.
6396400	6399600	And I approve of social progress at atheism.
6401520	6402160	At New York.
6402720	6403920	What a bold sense.
6403920	6407200	At IFC, at UCB, and just not UNICEF.
6407200	6408720	Boy, you're brave, man.
6410400	6411440	I take brave stances.
6411840	6415280	Joe, can we talk about them, speaking of brave stances.
6415280	6417280	Dan, this is neither the time nor the place.
6418160	6422400	Can we talk just a little bit about Jesus and what he means to everybody for a second?
6423760	6427120	Maybe to close your legs for a second, you manspreading his fucking whores.
6428400	6429280	He's so drunk.
6429280	6430240	He's so drunk right now.
6430240	6431520	You never heard about manspreading?
6431520	6432560	That's a big thing in New York.
6432560	6434400	Yeah, it's all over the subway.
6434400	6435280	Oh, no, yeah, I remember that.
6435280	6437120	I'm not allowed to have balls.
6437120	6439200	New York has literally made balls illegal.
6440160	6442000	You can't, you have to sit like this.
6442000	6445840	Regardless, I felt elephantly large your balls are.
6445840	6448480	You can't do this, because maybe you have balls.
6448480	6451200	You also can't do that if you're any gender.
6452400	6453760	It's more of a saying.
6453760	6456160	Sorry, in the summertime, my balls dangle to a place
6456160	6458000	where this is the only way I can sit.
6458560	6460720	Deal with it, assholes, okay?
6460720	6464800	I'm a cisgender straight male with large balls.
6464800	6467120	Do I not have rights anymore?
6467120	6468160	Yeah, they can't handle it.
6468400	6470560	They can't deal with it.
6470560	6471440	They're like, I don't know.
6471440	6473040	Our generation has small balls.
6473040	6474880	This show is brought to you by Absence.
6474880	6477120	Your reaction to Absence has made you
6477120	6479280	into an incredible volatile lunatic.
6479280	6480480	I love that.
6480480	6482160	It's about time we talked about my balls.
6483120	6484000	It's really great.
6484000	6484880	I read the web.
6484880	6486160	I know what people want to talk about.
6486160	6488000	It's bringing the wrong Belushi out of you.
6493360	6494400	Hold on, is there a line?
6494400	6496000	Is there a right Belushi?
6496000	6497280	Yes, there is.
6497840	6500160	Did Jim Belushi the correct Belushi to be?
6500160	6500640	No.
6500640	6501840	No, no, no, no.
6501840	6503840	No, that Jim Belushi's the one you become.
6504720	6506000	But wait, the other one's dead.
6506000	6508720	I feel like, nope, there's no good Belushi in this story.
6508720	6510640	Oh, well, if you think dead people are bad.
6510640	6511280	Yes, I do.
6511280	6513040	Well, that's not a brave stance.
6513040	6514160	They can't defend themselves.
6514160	6514960	Abraham Lincoln.
6516000	6518640	Rory, did you know that Kool-Aid used to have a different name?
6519280	6519840	That's true.
6519840	6520640	This is not a bit.
6520640	6521440	Changing or changing?
6521440	6523040	I swear I was changing or coming.
6523040	6523680	Abe Lincoln?
6524560	6525280	Kool-Aid.
6525280	6525760	Kool-Aid.
6526320	6527760	Why did I hear Abe Lincoln?
6527760	6529760	Because we're writing on the show about history.
6530560	6531760	Right now, I'm doing that?
6531760	6535040	No, I brought up Abe Lincoln and she's just Abe Lincoln.
6535040	6536320	Okay, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
6536320	6537040	Fucking absolutely.
6537040	6537520	Makes sense.
6537520	6538000	Not a bit.
6538000	6539360	Abe Lincoln freed the slaves.
6539360	6540880	Black people like Kool-Aid, I get it.
6540880	6541280	Go ahead.
6542960	6544560	It's a connection that she made.
6544560	6545760	I didn't make that connection.
6545760	6549360	I just want to say, I just want to say, I think the UCB Blacks is a great team,
6549360	6551680	but I think that their third beats are really weak.
6552800	6554000	When you're going to see them.
6556560	6557920	That's what they do to you, these people.
6557920	6559360	They love you and then they fucking hate you.
6560720	6563760	By the way, I used to have a joke about the Kool-Aid man,
6563760	6565680	you guys were talking about the Kool-Aid man in my stand-up act.
6565680	6567120	Give it a Jonestown massacre.
6568160	6569200	You did a bit about it?
6569200	6571360	Yes, but you did stand-up as a massacre?
6572080	6575760	No, because the Kool-Aid massacre, they all drank Kool-Aid flavor aid.
6575760	6578080	And then the whole point was the Kool-Aid man bust through and was like,
6578080	6579840	Oh, no.
6579840	6580640	And then you see it.
6580640	6581280	That's what he says.
6581280	6581760	Oh, no.
6581760	6581920	Yeah.
6581920	6582800	Of course, he's a masterful thing.
6583360	6584320	But at Jonestown,
6584960	6587120	yeah, people who like the history get that one.
6588480	6592320	If you don't like that joke, it's because you haven't read enough.
6594240	6596160	That's your fault, because that's a good thing.
6596160	6602320	Because reading a big, thick, but dense academic book is the only way
6602960	6607280	to know that Jonestown and Kool-Aid are dots you can connect.
6608320	6610320	Guys, take your Zipline in my stand-up act.
6612240	6613040	It's low elevation.
6613040	6614160	You'll get there very fast.
6614160	6615360	Ladies drink free.
6615360	6616880	It's right below the great gradient.
6616880	6618800	It's ground zero, comedically.
6618800	6621200	It's where the action is.
6622160	6628000	Kool-Aid was invented in 1920.
6629680	6630160	It's true.
6631040	6634160	No, this is not a bit when you guys were talking about Kool-Aid.
6634160	6635920	I got a little bored and I googled Kool-Aid.
6637280	6638080	It's a good show.
6638080	6638720	It's a good show.
6638720	6639440	It's a great show.
6639440	6640000	It's a great show.
6640000	6640480	It's a great show.
6640480	6641200	I didn't get bored.
6641200	6642720	I was just interested in Kool-Aid.
6643280	6645840	And it's funny because you said when you made the joke about like,
6645840	6646880	oh, you guys will look it up later.
6646880	6647840	I was like, what did he say?
6647840	6648560	And I was looking it up.
6648560	6650320	And as you were saying, you'll look it up later.
6650320	6650800	All right.
6650800	6654240	Anyway, it was originally called fruit smack.
6654240	6654720	Oh, wow.
6655920	6657760	And it was only changed in the 50s.
6658720	6659440	Fruit smack.
6660080	6664320	But then they found out that that's what Hitler's first Schlieffen plan was.
6664320	6668720	It's called before he changed it today.
6668720	6671520	You have to take it all the way to the turn left.
6671520	6674080	When you hit the channel, if your right foot hits the English channel,
6674080	6675120	then go down.
6675120	6675760	But they didn't.
6675760	6677120	Operation fruit smack.
6677120	6679840	Also on the Kool-Aid site, the first like when you're,
6679840	6681840	you know, when you're googling and it has like a blurb,
6681840	6683040	like the first text from the site.
6683040	6687840	And it said Kool-Aid was invented by a great, kind, wonderful man.
6689280	6689840	Who is he?
6689840	6690960	He's very defensive.
6690960	6692720	I think he may have like hit someone with his car.
6692720	6694640	That sounds like Steven Seagal's page.
6695600	6696400	Oh, my God.
6696400	6697520	Go treat yourself.
6697520	6700720	Go to Steven Seagal's IMDB page and read his biography.
6700720	6702240	It's insanity.
6702240	6704640	It's Steven Seagal comma, virile comma.
6708480	6711920	My IMDB page is so absolutely fallacious.
6711920	6715120	I think I'm dating the Grand Duchess Anastasia from 1918.
6715120	6717280	Like Jefferson Davis, probably.
6717280	6717840	No, me.
6719520	6720160	Who writes it?
6720160	6724960	That may be terrible to have people that care so much about your career that they're making up stuff.
6726480	6726980	What?
6729280	6730400	Where would you zip line?
6731680	6733920	By the way, for my Teen Wolf fans out there,
6735360	6737760	I want you to know that season five is going to be a real dizzy.
6739440	6741840	Get ready for some wolves, fucking.
6741840	6747520	And some werewolves turning into wolves and fucking wolves.
6748800	6749520	It's going to be good.
6750240	6753920	You promised at the Austin Television Festival you wouldn't go there.
6754000	6762560	Dan, look, as Jeff Davis, the not creator of Teen Wolf, the people think I am,
6762560	6764160	I'm going to give the people what they fucking want.
6764160	6766000	And what the people want is wolves fucking.
6767600	6768640	It's going to be doggy style.
6768640	6769680	Be careful of that feedback, wolf.
6769680	6773200	Mr. Davis, what do you call the show when he turns 20?
6773200	6773680	Wolf.
6776080	6777280	That's our show, everybody.
6779440	6783360	That may be your show, but mine requires a little bit more.
6784000	6785360	Now, Dan, look, we started off.
6787600	6790000	It requires my weird cigar box dick.
6790000	6793760	Dan, I don't believe in astrology as such,
6793760	6797040	but I do know that if you describe a Libra, you describe me very well.
6797040	6798320	I believe in balance.
6798320	6801440	We started off the show with you doing a very poor rap.
6802480	6805120	I think we've gone through like a couple of good ones.
6805120	6808000	And yeah, I think the only way to end the show,
6808000	6810880	because we must because we just got the we don't have time.
6811200	6811920	No, we flew.
6811920	6812560	We flew.
6812560	6814400	We flew Spencer out to.
6814400	6816240	You guys have been on stage for eight hours.
6816240	6818800	I interpreted the sign that guy gave us is more.
6818800	6819360	They love it.
6820240	6821280	He was giving a high five.
6821280	6822000	He's like, you know what?
6822000	6824560	Just drag the show across my throat.
6824560	6825280	It's so good.
6825280	6828880	It's curing my lymphatic cancer.
6828880	6829520	Don't stop.
6831200	6832000	Never stop.
6833840	6834960	Five more years.
6834960	6837040	You're massaging my throat with your great show.
6837040	6838560	My room is 555.
6838800	6841920	You're saying you're throwing the cancer out of my lungs.
6841920	6842800	I just love the innie.
6842800	6843600	Giraffe the show.
6844240	6845600	Make it an inhuman neck.
6846240	6847280	Giraffe it.
6847280	6851520	You know, in the audience right now, there are people that have never heard the podcast.
6851520	6852400	And don't go in the show.
6852400	6855120	If you're not happy with that, fucking kill yourselves.
6855120	6855920	Giraffe the show.
6856640	6858160	Giraffe the show.
6858160	6860160	Don't really go in the show.
6860160	6863440	Rory, Rory, Rory, take it.
6863440	6864080	Yeah, yeah.
6864080	6865440	No, yeah, it's that first.
6865440	6866880	Rory, no, Rory, you're first, baby.
6866880	6868240	Yeah, I'm on the clock.
6868960	6872320	Rory, Rory, Rory, get really racist.
6872320	6873840	Then you get really racist.
6873840	6875440	Don't tell me to get really racist.
6875440	6877520	East to the south, to the street, to the hat.
6877520	6878640	I fucked your mama.
6878640	6882880	Like my name was that guy that fucks your mama.
6882880	6885360	And then a camel, a llama.
6885360	6889840	Sometimes I go to easy places for a rhyme, but I won't say that I fucked your mama
6889840	6892880	and the word time because time rhymes with rhyme and everyone knows that.
6892880	6896000	But I fucked your mama so hard and she lost her hat.
6896000	6898800	Then I helped her find it in a mall.
6898800	6899680	She couldn't find it.
6899680	6901360	It was in a toilet stall.
6901360	6903600	Your mama doesn't poop, so we don't know why.
6903600	6906320	And then I fucked your daddy in his eye.
6907760	6909520	Gotta suck it for an eye.
6909520	6912160	Gonna fuck him right in the eye.
6912160	6917040	When I really fucking hold his head, I put my dick in his fucking eye hole.
6917040	6917680	Yeah, what?
6920320	6920820	What?
6922320	6924800	Just a cop who caught his name and people from Google.
6924800	6925440	Aaron, take it.
6925920	6927440	Aaron McGathey on the mic.
6927440	6928320	Break it down.
6928320	6933120	These guys are wasted on some absinthe and I've been in here like a perfect nymph
6933120	6937920	because when I spread my legs on the subway, it's a party.
6939920	6941520	Thank you for coming home, you guys.
6943920	6945200	That's been our three-hour show.
6945200	6946080	We love you so much.
6947920	6949600	Roy Albanese, am I saying that right?
6949600	6950240	How do you say it?
6950240	6950880	Albanese.
6950880	6952080	Albanese!
6952080	6952960	How nice.
6952960	6954800	Hey, Albanese!
6954800	6957360	Thank you, Jane, for the fight that Dan and I will have later.
6957360	6958800	Dan Hormon on I am sick.
6958800	6960400	It's dedicated to you!
6960400	6963040	Jane, for getting everybody absolutely murdered on Napsin.
6963040	6963680	Yeah, Jane, you're a nerd.
6963680	6966000	You're a McGathey, Spencer Creighton, and I'm Jeff Davis.
6967040	6968560	Dan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.
6973040	6973920	Go, Aaron, go!
6974480	6974960	Tabith!
6976240	6978800	Yo, yo, yo, yo.
6978800	6979840	Secret track.
6979840	6981040	Secret track.
6981040	6982080	You thought I was gone.
6982080	6982480	What?
6982480	6983200	Now I'm back.
6983200	6984160	Everybody leave.
6984160	6984800	Secret track.
6984800	6986240	You cannot leave.
6986240	6987520	You can never, ever leave.
6987520	6988560	You have to stay.
6989520	6990560	Secret track.
6990560	6991520	New podcast.
6991520	6994400	This one's just 20 minutes long, but it's like talking dead.
6995520	6997120	Yo, yo, yo.
6998160	6999600	What was that episode about?
6999600	7002240	Well, we're here live after watching that episode,
7002240	7004960	and it was pretty fucking weird, but the name is Chris hardware.
7004960	7006880	Two to the front and two to the rear.
7008240	7009520	Door prizes.
7009520	7010400	Bottle openers.
7011920	7012880	Random words.
7014400	7015200	Smaller.
7015200	7017120	This is the most exercise Dan gets, you guys.
7019840	7020480	All right, thank you.
7021680	7024160	I hope to see somebody with the taping on Wednesday,
7024160	7026160	if you were able to make it in there.
7026160	7028960	Rory Albanese, I don't know why I'm re-ending the show.

7030880	7031680	Thank you, everybody.
7032400	7034320	Sorry if I didn't get to play the game.
