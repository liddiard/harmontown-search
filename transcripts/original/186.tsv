0	12000	From Hollywood, California, just down the road from where the Oscars are happening and
12000	19000	horrible things are going down, black people are being admitted to the record.
19000	26000	Harman Town is now in session.
26000	33000	My name is Jeff Davis, and I'm happy to get back. Let's bring up Spencer Kittenman.
40000	42000	Rob Schwab!
43000	45000	Rob Schwab!
46000	50000	Rob Schwab!
54000	58000	The mayor of Harman Town, Stan Harman.
63000	65000	Hello. Hello.
68000	70000	It's weird coming out so early.
70000	72000	Yeah.
72000	74000	So we're bringing Schwab out at the top?
74000	77000	I started looking at vines and I was like, oh shit.
77000	81000	The Bible tells us, Dan, don't keep your light under a bushel.
81000	84000	Bring the Schwab out as soon as possible.
84000	86000	The kids like them.
86000	88000	You love them too, Dan.
88000	89000	Come on.
89000	95000	Historically, more often than not, but it's been a long time.
95000	97000	Yes.
97000	104000	What would that graph look like from 1991? Okay, we'll go on to yours.
104000	106000	Do it.
106000	110000	There'd be some valleys and some peaks. Same as any friendship.
110000	113000	That was the potential of that set up.
114000	117000	Are you...
117000	121000	Pretend I said this before he just said that.
121000	126000	Are you filling a Schwab peak or a Schwab valley right now?
126000	129000	I don't know. I just lost an Oscar.
129000	133000	To that fucking movie about the kid's brain.
135000	137000	The big short?
138000	141000	Let me tell you something about Pixar movies.
141000	143000	They're like eight million people making them.
143000	147000	If all of them vote for who gets an Oscar, that's how they do it.
147000	151000	Eight people worked on my fucking sweatshop movie.
151000	155000	For three years, we moved puppets a millimeter at a time.
156000	160000	That movie was about adults eating pussy in a hotel room.
160000	162000	It was about the futility of monogamy.
162000	165000	It was about our obsession with the other.
165000	168000	And in the human condition, Pixar's fine.
168000	171000	Stop giving them shit.
171000	174000	Don't encourage them. Scare them.
174000	176000	They will do better movies.
176000	179000	When they made Toy Story, they were scared.
179000	181000	They were scared it would be bad.
181000	184000	So they made it amazing.
184000	186000	Toy Story 3.
186000	189000	They were scared it was going to be as shitty as Toy Story 2.
189000	191000	So that was great.
191000	195000	Wait a minute. You thought Toy Story 2 was shitty?
196000	200000	I've never seen it. They thought it was.
201000	204000	I've obviously misread this right now.
204000	208000	Dan, I'm so sorry. You worked really, really hard on that movie.
208000	211000	I executive produced so hard on that movie.
211000	214000	You were there with your sleeves rolled up every day.
216000	219000	If there's one thing I know, when Dan's involved with anything animated,
219000	223000	he rolls up his sleeve and just is like,
223000	226000	What can I do to help? What do you need?
226000	229000	You need a sandwich? You need some water?
229000	232000	You need any kind of snacks? I know it's two o'clock.
232000	236000	I know we don't fill the refrigerator here at Star Burns, but I'm here.
236000	241000	We'll take care of it. You guys miss your wives and children?
241000	245000	What can I do? What can I do?
245000	250000	What can I do? Dan, what can I do?
250000	255000	Harmon, what can I do for you animators?
255000	261000	What can I do for you working on something that my name goes before your name?
261000	268000	Harmon, what can I help you? How can I help you work for me?
268000	271000	What can I do? What can I do?
271000	274000	Does your eyes hurt?
275000	278000	Spoken like an animator.
278000	281000	Does your eyes hurt?
281000	284000	I'm from cartoon town.
284000	287000	I don't know that everything starts with a script.
287000	292000	I was making the script better for your cartoon.
292000	295000	Yes.
295000	299000	You can't just draw a picture and have people go...
299000	301000	That's a gallery.
302000	305000	You were being very mean to me.
305000	309000	Well, that was justified. It sucks.
311000	316000	Well, anyways, you're catching me on theft night.
316000	318000	And here's the thing.
318000	319000	I...
319000	322000	Now this is going to sound like I'm concentrating.
322000	324000	Do your eyes hurt?
324000	328000	Yeah.
328000	330000	And do they hurt in the first act?
330000	333000	And do you cross a threshold into a world where they hurt in a different way?
333000	334000	You were really right.
334000	336000	This is what you were doing. Well, I...
336000	338000	Never mind. Anyway, go on.
338000	340000	You obviously wrote something there.
340000	343000	Let's see what happened. Let's see what you got.
343000	344000	Let's see what you got, writing.
344000	346000	What? What are you talking about?
346000	347000	You're looking at...
347000	351000	Oh, now, while I always look, I just have a little set list here.
351000	354000	Anyways, you wrote it. Okay. So, right.
354000	357000	What was I saying?
357000	359000	You were stolen.
359000	360000	Story structure.
360000	362000	Oh, right. Oh, so here's the thing.
362000	365000	Pixar. Racist.
365000	367000	And that's the thing.
367000	372000	I called Chris Rock, because he's sitting back there with the envelopes,
372000	375000	and I said, take us out of there. Just get us out of there.
375000	378000	Like, I don't feel comfortable...
378000	383000	In a year when too many fucking white people are...
383000	387000	And I said, give it to Pixar. They don't give a shit about black people.
387000	389000	And he was like, are you sure?
389000	394000	And I said, yeah. And so, that's the other thing about this,
394000	396000	is that, first of all, they don't deserve it.
396000	398000	Second of all, they're racist.
398000	402000	But also, I didn't realize the corruption that you could call Chris Rock up
402000	404000	and change the way the Oscars go.
404000	406000	Yeah, well, you saw those ticker tapes.
406000	409000	Everybody knows who's going to win. They had to write the ticker.
409000	411000	You guys saw that. They did the little teletype thing.
411000	414000	I thought that was kind of a... I thought that was an...
414000	416000	I hated it.
416000	420000	Nothing different is ever going to play like, oh, cool.
420000	422000	That's so cool that they did that different thing.
422000	424000	But some of the stuff, when you look at it, you go...
424000	428000	It reminded me of, like, remember MySpace when there was, like, your top five?
428000	430000	Eight.
430000	432000	Eight.
432000	434000	Back in my day, it was five.
435000	439000	Okay, whatever. Whatever number it is, the top blank, whatever.
439000	443000	So, it's like, you know, the people that get zing around there,
443000	446000	I mean, it was an argument starter, is what I'm saying,
446000	449000	back home or, like, tomorrow morning.
449000	451000	How come you didn't thank me on the mic?
451000	453000	No, that's why the teletype is genius,
453000	455000	because it's all the shitty people that will just get mad
455000	457000	if you don't thank them when you win an Oscar.
457000	460000	And the old pros are like, oh, this person did wardrobe for this thing
460000	462000	and it's like, she's been working for 30 years.
462000	464000	She gets to have a fucking huge ticker tape that goes like,
464000	468000	yes, stinky, stymie, poopy, toonie.
468000	472000	Yeah, you're so important, but honestly, they play you off in ten seconds.
472000	475000	And so, let me tell my little story and make my little sound off.
475000	478000	Oh, excuse me, it's top eight, not five.
480000	483000	Sorry, I just have to interrupt you right there, Mr. Schwab.
483000	486000	Actually, your free number's off.
486000	488000	Please continue.
489000	491000	For all of you.
491000	493000	All of them?
493000	494000	Yeah, McDonald's here.
494000	498000	Welcome to a special Axe Grinder's edition of Primantown.
498000	503000	I thought they had some cool, innovative ways to keep the Oscars shorter this year.
503000	506000	I could make a suggestion for next year, you could shorten,
506000	512000	you could take a half hour off this ceremony by having a separate Mad Max Award ceremony.
512000	515000	That's a little joke I wrote in here.
517000	519000	I didn't draw it.
520000	522000	I wrote it.
522000	525000	You know, you could really speed it up by cutting out white people.
525000	527000	It'd be fucking speed it right up.
531000	533000	Schwab loved that one.
534000	538000	Did you, what about, so here's something I will agree that they did different this year
538000	540000	that I thought was just like, don't do that.
540000	545000	Like when the people are standing and they're talking about the nominated movies,
545000	548000	the way they cut to the clips, the camera.
549000	552000	Yeah, well, oh, no, no, no, that's that.
552000	554000	Okay, we'll do we'll do my bit later.
554000	555000	Okay.
555000	559000	No, no, no, I'm talking about the steady cam thing where they have the presenters
559000	562000	and then they and then the presenters talk and then the camera move.
562000	565000	Instead of them cutting to a clip, the camera would move.
565000	567000	Oh, I like that too.
567000	568000	You liked it.
568000	570000	I thought that was horrible.
570000	571000	I like it.
571000	572000	I hated it.
572000	573000	I don't know.
573000	574000	I liked it.
574000	575000	You liked it.
575000	576000	That was cool.
576000	577000	See, okay.
577000	581000	And writer, I just thought, I just thought I was like, I just, it looks like,
581000	587000	did you love it when, when all over that, all over like that, that visual stuff,
587000	591000	they were typing the words over it, fade up.
591000	595000	Eric sips his coffee and you must've been like fucking.
595000	598000	Yeah, that's what the movie should have been like.
598000	604000	She, she smiles, looks at her keyboard and goes, oh, that's where the real art is.
604000	605000	I do.
605000	606000	I like watching.
606000	607000	Nobody else does.
607000	609000	So I never get to do it except when I'm by myself.
609000	611000	I put the closed caption on.
611000	612000	I forget.
612000	613000	I forget who the.
613000	614000	I do.
614000	616000	I forget who the presenters were, but they did say a thing about writers like
616000	619000	the backbone of all films is, are the writers.
619000	620000	Very true.
620000	621000	Very true.
621000	622000	I liked that.
622000	623000	They dealt with that nicely.
623000	624000	Very true.
624000	626000	I've never said it wasn't.
626000	630000	Well, obviously, fraudulent Oscars this year, as I said.
630000	632000	Except for Fury Road, that was pretty badass.
632000	633000	Well, I mean.
633000	634000	I like that.
634000	635000	I don't know.
635000	636000	I think discounts all those awards.
636000	639000	When you look across the board, whether or not the awards were distributed fairly, I
639000	641000	think Anomalisa should have won.
641000	644000	That's the shame is that now we have to question every single Fury Road award.
644000	645000	I agree.
645000	646000	I agree.
646000	647000	It's like, who are these people?
647000	648000	What are they thinking?
648000	651000	Yeah, but the animation people aren't voting for the other shit.
651000	656000	I like that Whoopi Goldberg dressed up as Ursula from Little Mermaid.
656000	659000	She looked like Ursula from Little Mermaid, right?
659000	661000	Did you guys, did you?
661000	662000	Okay, go for you.
662000	663000	It's your show.
663000	664000	Go ahead.
664000	666000	There's too much chatter red tooth.
666000	667000	All right.
667000	669000	That's an original Star Wars reference.
669000	670000	Red tooth?
670000	671000	Who's red tooth?
671000	672000	Red tooth.
672000	673000	Red tooth.
673000	674000	Red tooth.
674000	675000	Red tooth.
675000	677000	Got the chatter red tooth.
677000	680000	Got the chatter of Bluetooth.
680000	683000	Is it my Bluetooth or the red one?
683000	684000	Wait, what the hell?
684000	685000	What did we say before?
685000	688200	I had to be like one of those weird pirates from the show that yells at the people for
688200	689200	being bad pirates.
689200	690200	Little Mermaid.
690200	691200	Little Mermaid.
691200	692200	Whoopi Goldberg.
692200	693200	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
693200	694200	So, Benicio del Toro.
694200	695200	Benicio del Toro.
695200	696200	Did you see the bear bit and the thing?
696200	697200	Yeah.
697200	709440	And then for like a solid eight seconds, we all got to see what Benicio del Toro looks
709440	712280	like when he's amused.
712280	716680	Kind of stepped on the...
716680	717680	Not a real sneeze.
717680	718680	A real sabotage.
718680	719680	Knock, knock.
719680	720680	Who's there?
720680	721680	Dwayne.
721680	724680	Dwayne, do you want to...
724680	726680	That's great.
726680	729680	Keep going.
729680	732680	Dwayne who?
732680	737680	Anyways, Benicio del Toro.
737680	740680	Benicio del Toro.
740680	743680	Was it Dwayne the chap I'm drowning?
743680	746680	All right, moving on.
746680	750200	It's not like I have jokes on here.
750200	751200	That's the Oscars.
751200	752200	You got any Oscar opinions?
752200	753200	You don't care.
753200	754200	Oh, no.
754200	755200	I don't really watch the Oscars.
755200	756200	It's all...
756200	757200	I mean...
757200	758200	It's all white people who are racist.
758200	759200	It's...
759200	760200	They're just awards.
760200	761840	It's like, what does that mean?
761840	763400	You like what you like.
763400	765040	Isn't that the thing that matters?
765040	767640	Like who cares what other people like?
767640	768640	That's not...
768640	771640	I'm not doing it for that.
771640	773320	I just never understood it.
774320	778240	It's like, if it's great, then it lines up with your opinion, and if it's a bunch of
778240	781960	dumb idiots, then why do you care what they have to say?
781960	790320	Right, but on top of that, if someone says, hey Spencer, come take this statue.
790320	793880	We decided you're the most awesome person this year.
793880	795480	Are you going to tell them to go fuck themselves?
795480	797040	Well, I'm not in that...
797040	798040	I don't care.
798040	799040	I'm not in that world.
799040	801040	I don't make things that are going to get awards.
801040	808200	And then Whoopi Goldberg comes out, and he's like, I want to steal your voice.
808200	812680	I'm going to steal your voice, mermaid.
812680	815120	Did you watch her stuff when she was talking?
815120	818600	She was wandering around with the empty seats.
818600	819600	She's just wandering around.
819600	820600	I was like, look at here.
820600	821600	Whoopi Goldberg's here.
821600	822600	Hello, Whoopi.
822600	823600	Is it me?
823600	827760	Did they roll out every black person they could find to make it for the amount of non-black
827760	828760	nominees there were?
828760	829760	There was a lot of...
829760	833280	Lewis Gossett Jr. was out there like, Lewis Gossett Jr.
833280	836720	There was a lot of attention paid to that stuff to the point where we were all in a
836720	839160	fugue state watching it.
839160	843920	Every time we saw something, and maybe this is appropriate, we had to watch tonight's
843920	848760	Oscars through a racial lens for every single second of it.
848760	853400	So it didn't really matter whether they were actively doing a bit or actively being proactive
853400	855720	about in some ham-handed way of like...
855720	860600	But the bummer of that is that, for instance, if the guy that played Apollo Creed's kid
860600	865800	is out there and he's having a good year and he's like, wait, now I don't know.
865800	870040	I had to look at that and I was like, wait, who's who and what moves and what is part
870040	872840	of a facade and what is part of an actual honor?
872840	876960	There was certainly a dedicated apology to the lack of black nominees.
876960	881080	I couldn't tell if I...
881080	886960	All I knew is that it was oppressive, that I was supposed to have an opinion.
886960	888280	I didn't know...
888280	891480	I kind of feel like white people still haven't figured out how to respond to being called
891480	892480	racist.
892480	895480	I think that we still don't handle it quite...
895480	899920	No matter what part of the spectrum we are, we still don't handle it well.
899920	903680	You have declared Pixar racist for not making your movie with no black people in it.
903680	906240	Because calling people racist destroys them.
906240	911120	I'm being a regular person to destroy my enemies.
911120	912560	Because I don't care about race.
912560	915680	I use race to kill people.
915680	918760	See?
918760	920680	He's deposing me.
920680	922280	You're racist.
922280	923280	See?
923280	924280	If somebody...
924280	928920	If you're at dinner with somebody and you hope they pick up the tab, they don't pick
928920	935920	up the tab, tell your friends later that they're a little racist.
935920	938240	There's always a dot you can connect.
938240	939680	And it's not something you can...
939680	942680	It's not a bell you can un-ring.
942680	944760	It doesn't matter if it applies.
944760	947360	Like, lady, you're racist.
947360	950760	It's gonna stick with you for ten minutes.
950760	954600	It's just a strong, strong thing.
954600	955600	And it's a useful thing.
955600	956800	It's like a crowbar.
956800	957920	Use it to open things.
957920	959520	I lost an Oscar.
959520	960520	Pixar's racist.
960520	962720	I feel better.
962720	964320	Pixar doesn't care.
964320	968720	Black people, well, what could we do for them?
968720	970520	Pixar's racist.
970520	971520	I feel better.
971520	976600	Couldn't one of your main puppets in Anomalisa have been a black puppet?
976600	977840	You know, I've just executive produced it.
977840	979920	I didn't really work on the movie.
979920	980920	Oh!
980920	981920	Oh!
981920	982920	Interesting.
982920	983920	Very interesting.
983920	992760	So, you know, I definitely lost an Oscar tonight, but if you have a racial problem with the
992760	1002080	movie, I talked to Charlie Kaufman.
1002080	1006120	The real racist is Charlie Kaufman here, right?
1006120	1007120	It's on record.
1007120	1008120	That guy hates black people.
1008120	1009120	The real racist is everybody.
1009120	1010120	Okay.
1010120	1014800	Rob, is there gonna be any black Lego characters?
1014800	1015800	All of them.
1015800	1016800	All of them?
1016800	1017800	The whole movie?
1017800	1018800	Yeah.
1018800	1019800	Black Legos.
1019800	1020800	Yeah, yeah, all of them.
1020800	1025280	You know, a lot of money in toy manufacturing is make all the Lego pieces black pieces.
1025280	1029160	I'm not about the money.
1029160	1035240	I get paid in fun.
1035240	1044960	Like the last season of Community.
1044960	1049360	I'm saying I had a fun time doing that.
1049360	1050360	But you made no money.
1050360	1051360	No, I made.
1051360	1056400	I made plenty of money, but I got, I, I, Spencer, would you rather be paid in money
1056400	1057400	or fun?
1057400	1063320	Uh, it depends on the exchange rate, like how much fun.
1063320	1067920	Let's say it's even like, it's like Canada and the U.S. about like six years ago when
1067920	1069440	it was pretty close to even.
1069440	1070440	Wait.
1070440	1075080	I'm saying the exchange rate is like a dollar of fun equals a dollar of money.
1075080	1076080	Oh, fuck.
1076080	1084520	Don't, don't, don't examine this premise too closely, especially if you're the ghost
1084520	1085520	of Julia Child.
1085520	1086520	Yeah.
1086520	1087520	What does that mean?
1087520	1088520	Okay.
1088520	1089520	I'm just broccoli.
1089520	1090520	What does that mean?
1090520	1091520	Excuse me.
1091520	1102680	If you, for those of you listening, uh, a little red wine, she has a handkerchief and
1102680	1105680	she's, excuse me.
1106680	1107680	All right.
1107680	1108680	Talky audience tonight.
1108680	1109680	I don't know.
1109680	1113120	They're a little, they're a little chatty, but you know, that's okay.
1113120	1116000	We have an active audience that kind of bit us in the ass at the Chicago show.
1116000	1117000	I don't know, man.
1117000	1120400	We always have 800 people and then it's like, and when you go to a different city and people
1120400	1124800	in cities that aren't Los Angeles, that aren't like jaded and numbed down and like cool,
1124800	1126760	like, you know, we're all cool in LA.
1126760	1130920	Like we were used to like, so then when you go to a, you go to a different city and it's
1130920	1131920	like, holy shit.
1132920	1136720	Number one, that means you can fill in 800, like, what are you talking about?
1136720	1142720	I'm, I, I, if I put a gun to your head and asked you that question, what would you say?
1144720	1153720	What, what a Chicago show, the Chicago, I would pretend that you have to guess and you
1153720	1159720	tell me what, what, what Chicago show, Rob, or your family's going to die.
1159720	1161720	What do you think?
1161720	1162720	It's like a jigsaw.
1162720	1164720	It's a saw movie.
1164720	1165720	What Chicago show?
1165720	1166720	What Chicago show?
1166720	1168720	What am I talking about?
1168720	1170720	There's a spinning blade.
1170720	1172720	I'm about to say you did a show in Chicago.
1172720	1173720	Okay.
1173720	1174720	Yes, I did.
1174720	1176720	And you could do that in your head next time.
1176720	1178720	That whole process.
1178720	1179720	Well, you do.
1179720	1181720	You did a show Saturday.
1181720	1182720	I don't know what that is.
1182720	1183720	It doesn't matter.
1183720	1184720	You're not.
1184720	1185720	You're not Sherlock.
1185720	1187720	You don't need to know when everything happens.
1187720	1190720	Well, this is what happens when you bring me out this early.
1190720	1191720	He brought you out.
1191720	1192720	He brought you out.
1192720	1194720	And he did it to fuck with me.
1194720	1195720	Look at him.
1201720	1202720	So mean.
1202720	1203720	Anyways.
1203720	1204720	I think things are going just fine.
1204720	1208720	He's a mean, the mean person.
1208720	1209720	So mean.
1209720	1210720	Chicago show is weird.
1210720	1211720	Okay.
1211720	1212720	Moving on.
1212720	1214720	Why was it weird?
1215720	1220720	Dino told a story about the greatest dream of all time called Hot Rod Parade.
1220720	1222720	That was fucking fantastic.
1222720	1225720	And when it was over, you hadn't paid attention to it at all.
1225720	1228720	And you were like, let's just move on.
1228720	1229720	Well, that's my crap.
1229720	1230720	I mean, look, I'm not.
1230720	1231720	Yeah.
1231720	1233720	So I was too drunk and too preoccupied.
1233720	1234720	800 people.
1234720	1238720	If I feel like the show's not going well, I get too spun out.
1238720	1240720	You know, like I'm in my head.
1240720	1243720	And then we saw this in the movie, the Harman Town movie.
1243720	1246720	That's what happened on the Arizona show when we went out of the road.
1246720	1250720	I was like, if I start to think like I'm failing in my job somehow,
1250720	1251720	then I'll be thinking about that.
1251720	1253720	Ironically, I'll be like, how do I make the show good?
1253720	1254720	How do I make the show good?
1254720	1256720	And while I'm saying how do I make the show good?
1256720	1257720	Gotta work harder.
1260720	1261720	What do they need?
1261720	1263720	What do my people need?
1263720	1264720	People are under me.
1264720	1265720	They're working so hard.
1265720	1266720	How can I help them?
1269720	1271720	I feel so responsible.
1272720	1274720	I'm back on your, I'm on your side now.
1274720	1275720	I don't like what's going on.
1275720	1280720	And I'm going to give myself, I didn't get an Oscar tonight,
1280720	1281720	but I'm going to give myself an award.
1281720	1282720	You need to die.
1282720	1288720	For, my therapist told me, my problem is toxic shame.
1288720	1290720	Like I'm not going to feel shame by default.
1290720	1292720	You're trying to provoke my sense of shame.
1292720	1296720	And it's like, I work hard, but I'm not going to defend myself.
1296720	1298720	Nobody works harder than me.
1298720	1300720	You'll get Steve Levy to do it.
1300720	1301720	Steve, leave you out here.
1301720	1302720	Ask him how hard I work.
1304720	1306720	Steve, tell her to leave me.
1309720	1311720	I mean, I, hello.
1312720	1314720	It was a rhetorical suggestion.
1314720	1315720	I mean, I don't even know.
1315720	1318720	It was like saying, let's bring the Native American out here
1318720	1320720	and ask about talking about it.
1320720	1321720	Let's bring him out.
1321720	1323720	Let's bring Native American in prison.
1324720	1327720	Steve, tell, tell, tell Rob.
1327720	1331720	If I tell, tell Rob what your, your, your, your opinion of my work ethic.
1331720	1334720	He's the, he works harder than anybody I've ever met in my entire life.
1334720	1335720	That's true.
1335720	1337720	He's a fucking bargain, Hollywood.
1337720	1339720	It's crazy.
1339720	1341720	He's way better than anybody.
1341720	1343720	He's the most creative person I've ever met.
1343720	1345720	You're not doing the hype man thing right now either, right?
1345720	1346720	No.
1346720	1347720	Like this is separate.
1347720	1348720	This is actual truth.
1348720	1349720	This is passion.
1349720	1350720	You know, I love, I love you.
1350720	1351720	What felt?
1351720	1352720	What felt?
1352720	1353720	He said freestyle.
1353720	1354720	Freestyle.
1354720	1355720	Oh no.
1355720	1356720	Like a rap.
1356720	1357720	Put a pin in it.
1357720	1358720	Thank you.
1358720	1359720	Thank you.
1359720	1360720	I have, real quick.
1360720	1361720	I have a question about the Chicago show I was not at.
1361720	1362720	What was that beat?
1362720	1363720	That awesome rap beat.
1363720	1364720	Was that you Spencer that played that one?
1364720	1365720	No, no.
1365720	1366720	Who played that one?
1366720	1367720	Was that Dustin?
1367720	1368720	It was probably dusty.
1368720	1369720	Okay.
1369720	1370720	Cause we, we need to get that one back cause that was a goodie.
1370720	1371720	I don't have that beat.
1371720	1372720	It's a goodie.
1372720	1373720	I need to get that one on there.
1373720	1374720	Steve Levy.
1374720	1375720	Yeah.
1375720	1378720	Tell us about your famous buttermilk biscuits.
1378720	1379720	Oh yeah.
1379720	1380720	Wait, wait, wait.
1380720	1382720	Is it clear that I work hard?
1382720	1384720	Are you hearing that?
1384720	1385720	Does that register?
1385720	1390720	I think you work very hard Dan, because I, our friendship has fallen by the way, because
1390720	1391720	when I call you up, you're always working.
1391720	1392720	Yeah.
1392720	1395720	There are people suffering because I, because I work too hard.
1395720	1399160	Now, does that make you happy or does that feel like a burden to you?
1399160	1400360	I'm working through it.
1400360	1401360	I got to try.
1401360	1407000	I got to do more work to deal with my attitude toward work.
1407000	1409480	And this guy, this guy's the only guy.
1410480	1411480	Schwab.
1411480	1412480	It's a podcast.
1412480	1418080	He just insinuated that I don't work hard, but because I'm working in therapy very hard,
1418080	1421080	you didn't even go to therapy.
1421080	1422080	My therapist told me.
1422080	1423080	I thought you went to the same therapist.
1423080	1424080	No?
1424080	1425080	Yes, we do.
1425080	1426080	Not together.
1426080	1432200	Although that would probably be helpful.
1432200	1434880	I'm okay paying for your couples therapy.
1434880	1437880	Only, only if we can, only if we can shoot it.
1437880	1439880	Like, I want to shoot it like on video.
1439880	1442880	Be on the Harry Metz Sally couch.
1442880	1443880	For real.
1443880	1447360	If, if, if I pay for it, would you guys go to couples therapy and film it?
1447360	1451520	We're both paying for it already and our therapist, who's the same therapist, she says, if you
1451520	1455240	want to bring someone else in, like I'm going to, I'm going to go in with my new girlfriend
1455240	1460640	just because she does, just as a preemptive, it's like, whoa, let's weatherproof this thing.
1460640	1464520	And the therapist is like, yeah, bring anybody you wanted.
1464520	1466440	Bring your mailman in.
1466440	1467440	If you want to.
1467440	1469800	Should I try to go in the couples therapy just for kicks if I pay for it?
1469800	1470800	I hadn't thought of it.
1470800	1471800	You don't have to pay for it.
1471800	1472800	I want to pay for it.
1472800	1474800	I mean, I want to be involved in some way.
1474800	1476800	I would, yes, I would love to.
1476800	1479080	Will you go fund me or a kickstarter or some shit?
1479080	1483120	I know, only thing, the thing that would be perfect that won't happen is if our, if our
1483120	1488320	therapist that we see separately, that would be great to have her on the podcast.
1488320	1490880	But I know, I know that she would never, she would never do it.
1490880	1492240	That sounds really unethical.
1492240	1494240	She would never do it.
1494240	1497080	She's too professional.
1497840	1501640	I'm, I'm, I'm quite willing to write the check for you two to be filmed going to therapy
1501640	1502640	together.
1502640	1503640	All right.
1503640	1504640	Okay.
1504640	1506640	Steve, here's the thing.
1506640	1509280	Take your shirt off.
1509280	1517760	Just show the ladies, uh, uh, I get, you know, we got, we got, we got two guests that we do
1517760	1518760	bring out.
1518760	1522960	So I just, thank you for coming out and, and, and bouncing off of this guy.
1522960	1525520	You're kicking Steve Levy off the stage.
1526280	1527280	Yeah.
1527280	1531720	Because delegation is part of the fucking daily shit I have to put up with this podcast.
1531720	1540280	You know, I, uh, uh, great minds on the history channel, uh, uh, Rick and Morty is, is, is
1540280	1542320	community still happening somewhere?
1542320	1545120	Is it on C-SPAN now?
1545120	1551840	I'm probably working on that and I'm writing like 900 things, 900 things.
1552840	1556680	Do you ever spend time down just smelling the roses, swinging the hammock in the breeze?
1556680	1559200	Never just kick up your feet and just relax.
1559200	1560200	See what he's doing?
1560200	1562200	He thinks that I'm lazy.
1562200	1563200	I'm just asking.
1563200	1564200	I'm just saying.
1564200	1565200	He thinks I'm lazy.
1565200	1566200	Do you ever just like.
1566200	1567200	How insane is that?
1567200	1568200	Can you?
1568200	1569200	Can you?
1569200	1570200	Take a place in Minecraft.
1570200	1571360	He thinks I'm lazy.
1571360	1572840	You play a lot of Minecrafts.
1572840	1575320	Dude, you guys are fucking nuts, man.
1575320	1577840	Dan, I'm on your side so far.
1577840	1579160	Rob is being an antagonist right now.
1579160	1580160	I am.
1580160	1581160	I am.
1581480	1582480	I'm sorry.
1582480	1590560	I'm not proud of, uh, I'm not proud of the fact that I work hard, so I'm not defending
1590560	1596520	myself from these ridiculous, like, like allegations, transparently based on pediments.
1596520	1599080	You do kick up your feet because I asked you today, you said you were going to go have
1599080	1601320	brunch today and I said, do you want, do you want to go out and have a drink?
1601320	1603640	He said, I'm going to go home and play a little Lex box.
1603640	1605080	That's you kicking up your feet.
1605080	1608080	That's you relaxing of a Sunday afternoon.
1608080	1615960	He just needs to just turn off the brain for a bit, just like, I'm not all the buzzing.
1615960	1616960	Okay.
1616960	1617960	All right.
1617960	1621480	Well, yeah, because we did bits and fought with each other, we didn't talk about the
1621480	1626800	KKK rally in Anaheim or the, or the very important Apple FBI privacy issues.
1626800	1631200	You'll have to listen to some other podcasts with it, with it, with it has a little more
1631200	1634560	control over itself to get, to get an insight into these issues.
1634560	1636840	You'll have to Google it and educate yourself.
1636840	1637840	I don't know.
1638600	1639920	I wrote coughing and farting.
1639920	1640920	Oh, that's important.
1640920	1641920	All right.
1641920	1642920	Before we bring our guests out.
1642920	1643920	Okay.
1643920	1645640	So this is an important question because this happened to me today.
1645640	1648120	So I, I, I, I, I coughed and I farted.
1648120	1653440	I was, and I was with my girlfriend and I, I was, I was like, simultaneously like exactly
1653440	1654440	at the same time.
1654440	1655440	No, in alter.
1655440	1656440	No, no, no.
1656440	1658360	Was it like cuff art or is it exactly the same time?
1658360	1659360	Of course at the same time.
1659360	1660360	Cause it's the whole day.
1660360	1662800	So talking, talking, talking to her, I was just like, yeah.
1662800	1666960	So anyways, and it's great and it's great to be in love and have respect for each other
1666960	1672600	and to not have our opinions about each other, be affected by anything, you know, like, like
1672600	1673600	it happened at the same time.
1673600	1677480	So when you cough, your cough is loudest to you.
1677480	1680640	Your fart, you know, your, you know, you farted.
1680640	1685080	What you don't know is if the person is a foot away from you, um, if, if they heard
1685080	1687720	the cough louder than the fart.
1687720	1689400	So here's the dilemma.
1689400	1693160	So this is why I always go, first I'm going to say what I always do and then I'm going
1693160	1694160	to explain why.
1694160	1696840	I always, when that happens, I go.
1697840	1701040	And then I go, I farted when I coughed.
1701040	1706120	The reason I do that is because what if they heard it and I ignored it?
1706120	1708480	You want to get, you want to get in front of that news cycle.
1708480	1710280	What if they, yes.
1710280	1715440	What if they heard it and they thought I was coughing to cover a fart instead of leaving
1715440	1716440	the room?
1716440	1718920	It's like the truth is it was an accident.
1718920	1723320	If I had to fart, I would have left the room and farted and come back.
1723320	1729400	I would never do something like that, like be dishonest and go like, are you saying
1729400	1730640	the cough made you fart?
1730640	1733480	Like it was the course the cough made me fart.
1733480	1734480	What do you mean?
1734480	1735480	What's the alternative to that?
1735480	1737720	They could have been independent of each other.
1737720	1738720	What?
1738720	1741760	You could have coughed and farted and they had nothing to do with each other.
1741760	1743600	What are the odds of that happening?
1743600	1744800	That's insane.
1744800	1750200	Do you always, do you always, do you always cough when you fart?
1750200	1751200	No.
1751200	1755680	Or do you fart separately sometimes?
1755680	1759120	Fart separately all the time and cough separately.
1759120	1761840	But obviously, dumb of a question then.
1761840	1762840	You guys.
1762840	1763840	Okay.
1763840	1768200	I think, I think of a cough as more of a, like an upper body thoracic kind of thing and
1768200	1770200	the farts being more of a lumbar and below.
1770200	1774760	Yeah, but when you get your balls groped by the doctor, he says turn left and cough and
1774760	1777200	fart on him.
1777200	1780800	But I'm saying your balls are closer to your ass than your chest.
1780800	1781800	Right.
1781800	1782800	At least mine are.
1782800	1783800	Are you sure?
1783800	1784800	Humblebrag.
1784800	1785800	Picks or it didn't happen, Rob.
1785800	1786800	All right.
1786800	1787800	Sorry.
1787800	1798120	So when you cough, you may fart.
1798120	1802360	I can't believe this is, am I going to find out I'm weird this way?
1802360	1805080	I have a little more core strength than you, maybe.
1805080	1807200	That's probably, I won't deny that at all.
1807200	1810080	My chiropractor's all over me about my core.
1810080	1811080	That probably is a thing.
1811080	1813400	How are you and your chiropractor doing?
1813400	1818560	I'm down to once a week and I'm on a vitamin D prescription thanks to my doctor and everything's
1818560	1819560	going great.
1819560	1820560	I've lost, I've lost weight.
1820560	1824240	I know it doesn't look like that, but, and my, and everything's doing great.
1824240	1828760	My doctor's very happy about, about how my diet's going and I'm, I'm doing great.
1828760	1835400	I know I look like a big, sweaty, gross slug and I'm saying that I, when I cough, I fart.
1835400	1837680	When I cough, every time I cough, I don't fart.
1837680	1838680	Right.
1838680	1840160	I think it's insane.
1840160	1843000	Not all the glitters is gold.
1843000	1845720	All right.
1845720	1846720	Let's just, we could just.
1846720	1847720	Okay.
1847720	1848720	So you're coughing and farting.
1848720	1850800	Well, I think I'm, I guess we're done with that.
1850800	1854280	I just get, I feel like I, you know, I don't want to, I just, I.
1854280	1855280	So you cough.
1855280	1856280	I wanted to know.
1856280	1859200	You cough farted in front of your new girlfriend and what was the upshot of that?
1859200	1864080	I wanted to know because this happened today and I, and it made me, it made me remember
1864080	1868600	that regardless of how long I've been dating somebody regardless, it doesn't matter.
1868600	1873760	Regardless of who the other person is, I've always, when that happens, when I cough and
1873760	1879480	I fart, I always, I go, I just go and it's like, I have to make this decision in my head
1879480	1884680	where I go, there's a good chance that, that, that now I'm just going to be telling a person
1884680	1887360	that didn't want to know that I farted.
1887360	1891600	However, to me, it's sort of like the legal systems philosophy.
1891600	1897680	It's like, it's better to, to, to, to let 10 innocent men go go or 10 guilty men go free
1897680	1900560	than the idea of one innocent man going to prison.
1900560	1905520	It's to me, it's, it's, it's, it's better to have nine people go like, why is he always
1905520	1913480	telling us when he farts after a cough than to have one person go, do you know that fucking
1913480	1915560	guy did the other day?
1915560	1918560	He had to fart, so he faked a cough.
1918560	1920580	He didn't get up and go away.
1920580	1925240	He just fucking, he thinks I'm so stupid that he could just cover his farts and he just,
1925240	1927720	and Andy wanted me to just sit in a fart.
1927720	1933440	I don't want anyone thinking, they let 10 guilty men.
1933440	1937680	They're supposed to, they're supposed to, we don't really approach it that way.
1937680	1939960	But that's supposed to let 10.
1939960	1940960	It's better.
1940960	1941960	Guilty men.
1941960	1945200	That's a, that's an American justice philosophy that we learned in high school.
1945200	1947040	They should change that.
1947040	1952520	Dan, did you, did you find out, did you find out if, if, if you were busted on the fart
1952520	1953520	or not?
1953520	1954520	Did you know?
1954800	1960480	And I've done it before too and she said again, she's like, why do you keep telling me when
1960480	1961480	that happens?
1961480	1963240	And I said, I didn't know you farted.
1963240	1966800	And I said, well, I didn't know you didn't know, so I had to tell you.
1966800	1968160	That makes you a good person though.
1968160	1969160	That makes you a good.
1969160	1970160	That's what I told her.
1970160	1971160	Yeah.
1971160	1974160	It also makes you a guy with no core strength.
1974160	1975160	And that's true.
1975160	1976160	And I'm going to work on that.
1976160	1977160	Okay.
1977160	1980600	Our next guests, you know, you've probably seen these, these, these, these, these bus
1980720	1987000	stop ads around for this very funny new show that's, that's being drawn at a really, really
1987000	1991760	cool, hardworking animation studio in Burbank called Starburns Industries.
1991760	1994160	And you see these little ads.
2010720	2011720	I don't even know.
2011880	2012880	I don't even know what you're doing.
2019640	2022960	There was the greatest protest I've ever seen in my life.
2026800	2027880	Totally unrelated question.
2027880	2028880	How old are you?
2030680	2032640	Just unrelated, totally unrelated.
2035440	2038320	It wouldn't be a great time for everyone to just go around the room and just state their
2038320	2039320	age.
2040320	2048480	And then the guy that just did that should go last and go, and you'd be like, whoa, that
2048480	2053320	behavior, that really, you've walked the earth that long.
2053320	2056600	You've, you've made and witnessed that many mistakes.
2058120	2059240	You got to push harder.
2060080	2062480	How do you, what, what, what, you got to push harder.
2062480	2063480	This is what you do, Dan.
2063480	2064000	Excuse me.
2064360	2065600	This is what you do, Jeff.
2065600	2065960	Jeff.
2065960	2066360	Yeah.
2069320	2073040	You have to have the, you get the microphone real close.
2073880	2075880	You have to have the soul of a six year old.
2077000	2078360	It's like Thor's hammer.
2079800	2084360	No one else can fuck up like, oh my God, he's scraping.
2084360	2085480	He's like scraping.
2085920	2086360	I am.
2086360	2086960	I'm ruining.
2089200	2089880	I wasn't looking.
2092040	2093320	Obviously it's had a few days.
2093320	2094040	I just do this.
2094040	2094840	I just do this.
2097320	2097720	All right.
2097920	2100400	Jonah Ray's going to be going, what the fuck, man?
2101920	2103400	What the fuck, man?
2104040	2105000	Anyways.
2105040	2106520	What the fuck, man?
2108080	2109560	I can't tell who to root for anymore.
2111440	2112720	What the fuck, man?
2115760	2124360	Uh, there's this really funny show on HBO on 11 30 at 11 30 on Fridays and it's
2124360	2127520	called animals and it's all your favorite comedy people doing these little
2127520	2132040	sketches and they're drawn as these like little animal people and, uh, animal
2132040	2134040	people, they're in the back going, he's never seen the show.
2134120	2137600	I have not that much, but I know they're not animal people.
2137880	2141280	Um, they're, they're animals, but they're, I'm not going to define their show.
2141560	2144920	Um, uh, they're, they're, they love working at star burns.
2144920	2147680	They think it's amazing how hard I work.
2147760	2151440	They don't, I don't really talk to them and I can't tell the difference between
2151440	2151640	them.
2151840	2154760	Uh, let's bring out the creators of HBO's animals.
2154880	2157520	Uh, Mike Luciano and Phil Matarice.
2165040	2167120	Hi, everybody.
2167200	2168120	I'm Phil.
2169640	2173600	I was going to say, I was going to say, they're going to come out and sit and
2173600	2175800	Phil's going to sit here and Mike's going to sit here.
2175800	2177360	You nailed it because I'm not built.
2177360	2180560	So I always just want to be make that clear off the bat.
2180640	2184560	It's easier to say Mike and Phil, but I just want everyone to know.
2185080	2188760	When you see the credits created by, it's not alphabetical.
2188760	2191600	But if you're talking to friends and everything, you can say, Mike and Phil,
2191600	2195200	you know, it's, if you guys commit to this glasses, no glasses thing, there's
2195200	2196280	not going to be a problem.
2196320	2200120	Like I'm always going to know from now on, Mike, Phil, easy.
2200760	2202360	And we're also different people too.
2202360	2206080	So that's also the other part of my face.
2206080	2207080	That's the other thing.
2207120	2207560	I don't know.
2207920	2212040	Maybe that take off your glasses for a second.
2212160	2213440	Uh, either Phil or Mike.
2213600	2213960	Okay.
2214480	2215640	Now look at this shit.
2215640	2216320	Come on.
2216480	2217920	Are you fucking kidding me?
2218480	2221600	Now imagine if they had the same haircut, which they did a week ago.
2222360	2222760	You know what?
2223480	2225040	I don't don't fuck you guys.
2225040	2225800	Come on, Dan.
2225800	2226160	No, it is.
2226160	2231040	Cause like, I've been going to, I, I, I, I confused people that are
2231040	2233080	way less identical than you guys.
2233400	2236000	I get in trouble like all the fucking time.
2236160	2238560	This sounds like a damn problem then, doesn't it?
2238680	2239680	Yes, it is.
2239680	2241360	And I've been honest about my face.
2242360	2244360	Hey, you guys, you guys have put up with a lot.
2244720	2249040	I should obviously, but I swear to God, there was one time when, uh, you guys
2249040	2253240	were coming over, we were going to go to Comic Con and, and I, and I said to my
2253240	2257440	then wife, Aaron McGathey, I said, like, they're going to be here in a half hour.
2257800	2259320	You need to help me with something.
2260320	2262400	These two guys fucking look the same.
2262400	2265480	And she's like, come on, grow up and Google them and figure it out.
2265480	2266840	And I said, okay.
2267160	2269800	And I, and then I came back in and I said, come here for a second.
2270320	2271200	And I sat her.
2271200	2273840	And I said, you fucking tell me, give me a mnemonic device.
2274120	2276320	And she, and she was like, fill hat.
2276320	2280400	Cause there was like, uh, it was like a, uh, South by South by interview or
2280400	2282560	something, where it was like a person and it was like a perfect set up.
2282560	2284800	Cause it was like, so what's it like when you do the thing?
2284800	2287960	And there's like, it was like one of you in a single and it's got your
2287960	2290920	name and then the other, and Aaron went, oh boy.
2292600	2299880	But she was like, for pride sake, she was like, well, Phil's ears are farther.
2301680	2302160	Yeah.
2304520	2309360	And whatever she said, we did, we did, we did say she, she, she was like, okay,
2309440	2313160	fuck it was something with the ears and whatever it was, I swear to God,
2313160	2314400	like I'm not doing it as a bit.
2314400	2318480	Like you guys showed up and I looked at ears and we had an earmuffs on.
2318920	2319200	Yeah.
2320880	2321360	Hold on.
2321360	2324160	Ears like did this thing where I was like, this is Mike.
2324160	2327400	And you went, I'm Phil and the ear thing.
2327440	2327760	All right.
2327760	2328840	So that's the end of my story.
2328960	2330360	The glasses thing is fucking great.
2330400	2331120	This is good.
2331200	2332240	You got to keep them on baby.
2332240	2334240	Stick to it for me.
2334960	2335800	It's Phil, right?
2336000	2336640	I'm Phil.
2336640	2337120	You're Phil.
2338280	2341840	Phil, you look a little bit more like Andy Garcia than Mike.
2342640	2343480	Thank you so much.
2343480	2346040	That's how I'm going to, that's how I'm going to go along with that one for now.
2346400	2346880	That works.
2346880	2349280	You look a little bit more like Jewish Hans Gruber.
2349640	2350040	Okay.
2351280	2352720	You're not Jewish, but I'll take it.
2352720	2355000	I'll do well anyway.
2355000	2357800	So that fucked me up because you guys both look like Jewish Hans Gruber.
2359080	2359640	I take it back.
2359880	2360840	You're Andy Garcia.
2360840	2361920	You're not Andy Garcia.
2363240	2364320	Let's thank you, Jeff.
2364400	2365040	Thank you, Phil.
2365160	2365520	Right.
2365880	2366480	Whoa.
2366520	2366880	See?
2366880	2367640	Yeah, fucking.
2368160	2369000	I'm writing in my notes.
2369000	2369440	Phil.
2369480	2370160	He's got it.
2370160	2370520	Phil.
2370520	2371760	He's been working with you for a year.
2371800	2372960	Phil, Andy Garcia.
2373600	2376600	I just, uh, my technique is when I walk in a room, they're always both there.
2376600	2378720	So I always go, well, if it isn't Mike and Phil.
2380040	2380720	That's good.
2380720	2381200	Bring it in.
2381200	2382680	That's really good.
2382720	2383320	Always works.
2383320	2384760	In no particular order.
2385040	2385320	Yeah.
2385320	2385600	Yeah.
2385600	2385840	Yeah.
2386120	2386400	All right.
2386440	2387280	Enough about that.
2387800	2389200	Let's talk about, let's talk about.
2389920	2393680	How important is it to be a writer, especially in animation, to have a beard?
2394760	2396400	I think it's a, yeah, it's a necessity.
2396400	2397120	You have to.
2397720	2399720	Am I the only guy in Hollywood that doesn't have a beard?
2400120	2403320	And also it's the reason why I don't want to get up in the morning and write is
2403320	2405080	because I can't grow a good beard.
2405080	2407600	I, I, I grew a very patchy Johnny Depp.
2408040	2411520	Uh, who was that Asian guy in the red carpet who had the worst patchiest beard
2411520	2411880	of all time?
2411880	2413080	I grow that kind of beard.
2413800	2414560	Stucky Chan.
2414640	2418920	If I grew, if I grow sexy beard, would I be a better writer?
2418920	2419800	Here's the question I have.
2420560	2421000	Yes.
2421000	2421280	Yup.
2421280	2421640	Yes.
2421640	2421880	Yeah.
2421880	2424000	It's, it's a giant beard.
2425280	2425640	All right.
2425640	2427880	So like, what was it a year and a half ago?
2427920	2433160	You guys, you guys had this thing on the internet pictures of animals, dry comedy,
2433200	2436120	like, like, uh, eight frames per hour.
2437920	2442000	Like, cause it's just like drawing of animal doing a setup, like, like, like,
2442000	2444720	doing kind of like, like very organic kind of impromptu.
2444720	2445800	I'm going to get a soda.
2445840	2446520	Oh fuck.
2446520	2447320	He's so jealous.
2447320	2449480	Cause there's people that draw up here.
2450400	2452200	I mean, I'm probably sitting here and it's hot.
2452200	2453120	We'll go get a soda.
2453120	2453520	Yes.
2453720	2454520	No offense.
2454600	2455280	Okay.
2455280	2457160	None, none to come back though.
2457240	2460120	I'll, I'll come back really quietly and I won't interrupt.
2460120	2460800	I get it.
2460840	2461840	No, I get it.
2462160	2462520	Yeah.
2463080	2465240	Got the old harm and town standbys up here.
2465760	2467560	Then these two young guys walk in.
2468080	2469400	Throw it all for a loop.
2469840	2470440	I'm sorry.
2470440	2471800	I'm not going to mail you guys.
2473960	2476880	No, me, you guys, we have an intro show too though.
2477000	2482440	So if you're all very quiet, if you're all very quiet, you can see something you
2482440	2487400	very rarely see in nature, the Rob Schwab going out to get a soda.
2490040	2490240	Yeah.
2490240	2494560	To be a, to be an artist and to invoke the Schwab passive aggression is like that
2494560	2496160	strong, that strong man bell.
2496160	2498560	Like you guys said it right to the top.
2498560	2501120	He wouldn't be intimidated if you guys just doodled something on an app kit.
2501160	2501440	Yeah.
2501440	2502560	Is there an HBO?
2502560	2504600	And he was like, fuck, what am I doing with my wife?
2505600	2507040	I got a, I got a two baby.
2507040	2507560	That's good.
2507600	2509520	But you guys, you guys are self starters.
2509560	2514680	You're like the weekend, the right, the guy, not the two days, the concept.
2514680	2519440	Yeah, the one guy, this is all, this is post internet.
2519440	2521720	Like, these guys on the internet do a thing.
2521720	2523400	Now it's really is the way it works.
2523400	2525600	Like you guys are self starting internet dudes.
2525600	2529760	Like you, you started doing this thing as it is on the internet, following your
2529760	2531720	passion, making yourselves channel one on one.
2531880	2536080	Then went to channel one, New York, channel one, New York, baby.
2536480	2538440	Then went to a weird take.
2538520	2538960	What was it?
2538960	2540400	The New York TV festival?
2540440	2541240	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2541280	2543520	Where Mitch Hurwitz was like, you guys are awesome.
2543520	2545960	Yeah, we lost brothers were like, you guys are awesome.
2546000	2546440	Yeah.
2546760	2548720	What, what is Mitch's steak now?
2549160	2549600	Oh no.
2549600	2552360	He did a voice, um, in two episodes.
2552360	2556280	He's, he's my dad in an episode, but he, um, does he like, he does he, no, he's
2556280	2559600	going to send money from the budget to the show to him.
2560560	2561680	He's got nothing to do with it anymore.
2561680	2563280	We partner with the plus bros.
2563280	2568360	So those guys are our executive producers and how we were able to make a bunch of
2568360	2572760	episodes independently for like a year before we partnered with Starbucks to
2572760	2574680	finish it out and sell it to HBO.
2574760	2576840	And we just give you a little home, keep you off the street.
2576880	2577640	You did.
2577760	2580600	And I think it's nice that I don't do anything on your show.
2580640	2581680	I think it's kind of cool.
2581680	2583040	Cause we just kind of pass in the halls.
2583040	2586200	And especially when Rick and Morty was there too, it's just like, I don't know.
2586200	2586920	It's a little gang.
2587120	2587520	Yeah.
2587520	2588000	It's lovely.
2588000	2590360	And you see me and you go, boy, there's Dan.
2591240	2594800	Like he doesn't, he's not going to come in here and tell us how to draw an animal.
2594840	2595280	Yeah.
2595800	2597480	Well, that wouldn't be any of my business.
2598560	2599560	I'm not lazy.
2599840	2600560	No, you're not.
2600720	2601600	You're there late.
2601880	2604800	And I've seen you there very early from like the night before.
2604840	2607160	It seems like Dan, you're a little hands off on the show.
2607160	2607720	I mean, you don't know.
2609040	2610240	That's a good thing.
2610280	2611160	It's a good thing.
2611360	2612400	I was came up to us.
2612400	2613840	You're, I thought you were a workaholic.
2613840	2617240	I thought that was your gimmick, but yeah, you, you, you care too much.
2617560	2618480	You work too hard.
2618600	2621360	Well, the first time he came up to us, he rolled up his sleeves and he was like,
2621360	2622360	what can I do that?
2622360	2624320	I did, I did, I did.
2624320	2625200	So sandwich.
2625280	2627560	And then, you know, I did have that meeting with you guys.
2628720	2629120	I don't know.
2629120	2630720	It was nice.
2630720	2632200	But then I didn't see him for a long time.
2632200	2634000	Mike's like, Mike, is Dan Harmon a PA?
2634200	2635400	Dan doesn't have sleeves.
2635400	2637000	Dan's never had sleeves.
2637360	2637760	Yeah.
2637880	2641440	But did you, I do remember that conversation because we talked for a half hour.
2641440	2642920	I was like, these guys seem like cool guys.
2643560	2644280	You already had it.
2644480	2645720	There are already guys in the building.
2645720	2646840	It's like a different relationship.
2646840	2650000	It's like you guys said, like the Duplass brothers were like, you guys should do
2650000	2650600	your thing.
2650600	2653600	They were your benefactors and you guys tried as hard as you could to do it
2653600	2655120	literally by yourselves.
2655400	2657240	And then it was like, holy shit, we're going to go insane.
2657400	2659880	So it's just, you really, they're more tenants.
2659880	2663040	They're not like, it's not like they're, it's like, they're not a brainchild of
2663040	2666040	Starburst, Starburst, a building where they get to work.
2666240	2672200	But, but I, nevertheless, because I love creativity and because I'm sort of a,
2672760	2674000	I'm just a wonderful person.
2674400	2676000	I, I, so good.
2676320	2679080	And because you never know, you guys could give me a job one day.
2679080	2680040	I don't have no idea.
2680040	2681440	You can't, that's what Hollywood's about.
2681440	2683920	You get a kid, you don't say no to anything.
2683960	2685200	I bring you in my office.
2685200	2689600	I said, if there's ever anything I can do and you guys are like, great, but you've
2689600	2690640	never needed anything.
2691120	2692000	No, not really.
2692720	2695000	I mean, part of, part of why are we with you guys?
2696000	2696680	It's a building.
2696680	2701480	You know, we, we, when we went around to try to like, find the animation studio
2701480	2704280	that was going to help us, because initially we made the first two episodes
2704280	2708920	of our show that just aired on TV two weeks ago, literally in an apartment
2708920	2710520	that Phil and I lived with, huh?
2710720	2711480	Four weeks ago.
2711480	2712720	Four weeks ago, there I was.
2713240	2715600	And I would listen to Harmontowns when I was making it.
2715600	2717200	So it's very bizarre to be up here.
2717800	2718600	It was really sweet.
2718600	2719400	It's a weird thing.
2720000	2721960	But, um, but shut up you.
2723640	2724360	I know you.
2724720	2725960	I listen to Harmontown.
2726160	2726600	Okay.
2727040	2728400	I'm on the subreddit.
2728720	2730520	You're not going to take this away from me.
2731200	2732480	I worked too hard for this.
2734800	2735480	Oh my God.
2735880	2739960	Mike, Mike Luciano was the first person to realize or up here that
2739960	2741440	Adam Goldberg's in the audience.
2741800	2743800	Dan, that was Phil.
2743800	2745280	You called me Mike!
2746080	2747280	Phil is Andy Garcia.
2747520	2748000	Yeah, there you go.
2748000	2749240	Phil is Andy Garcia.
2749240	2749720	Yeah, there you go.
2749720	2751800	Mike is Neil Berkley.
2751840	2752160	Yeah.
2753200	2754080	You see what you did?
2754120	2756080	Mike Neil Berkley, Phil Andy Garcia.
2756080	2756640	This is the problem.
2756640	2757840	This is the problem that keeps happening.
2758000	2763080	My mnemonic device keeps being the guy that doesn't look like a Phil is the Phil.
2763520	2764600	And I keep flipping it.
2764600	2765720	So I was like Phil?
2765720	2769360	Tonight I walked into the green room and it was like, you look like a Mike.
2769520	2770280	Thank you.
2770880	2772600	Phil is an asshole name.
2772600	2776240	Every dumb dad or every fucking fool in a commercial is named Phil.
2776280	2777360	It's, it's kind of hack.
2777360	2778080	I can't shut up.
2778200	2779600	Being named Phil is hack.
2779600	2780800	It's like a main character name.
2780800	2781280	Phil.
2782720	2784960	Now Dan, just invert that in your mind.
2784960	2786880	Like he's the nonintuitive Phil.
2786880	2788680	Like that's your connection now.
2789080	2791520	I mean, the original thing, I started panicking that first meeting.
2791520	2792200	You guys remember it.
2792200	2793760	I was like looking at your shoes.
2793760	2795840	Cause I was like, Mike's wearing NYX.
2796800	2801200	What are the odds he'll continue to wear NYX and then they fucking like
2801800	2803280	We go all crazy.
2803960	2805960	Cause, cause obviously that's the first thing that happens when you get
2805960	2806440	successful.
2806440	2807360	You're like, how many shoes?
2807360	2808520	Yeah, exactly.
2808520	2810000	I have so many shoes.
2810480	2814000	I am Novi Orish, so I'm trying to buy up the whole shoe store.
2814000	2814400	Go ahead.
2814400	2816080	Mike and Phil, how do you guys know each other?
2816080	2817520	What's, what's your origin story?
2817640	2821320	We met at an ad agency in New York that we both worked at.
2821320	2825600	And we just kind of started doing this thing weekends, nights, and, um, it
2825600	2826360	sort of snowballed.
2826400	2828120	And what's the dynamic between the two of you?
2828120	2832360	One guy's the, one guy's the more of the dry guy and one guy's the over the
2832360	2836560	shoulder kind of comedy guy or like, you know, just a friendship tension.
2836560	2836960	What'd you say?
2836960	2838080	Oh, tension, yeah.
2838280	2839640	Who's the shrub and who's the harm?
2839640	2844000	I'm the shrub and I wouldn't say he's the harm and necessarily cause I want
2844000	2847720	to be the harm in, but, um, yeah, I do the drawing.
2847720	2852840	Mike does the editing of the dialogue cause it's improvised our show.
2853120	2858280	Um, so that's actually a huge, or it's like a big, big step, I would say.
2858600	2860760	Um, and we write it, we write everything together.
2860800	2863440	We write all the episodes and, um, do you guys ever fight?
2863440	2867800	You guys have tension in the, uh, in the edit Bay or we're writing season two now.
2867800	2873080	And that's the most difficult part is like, it's so much of writing is sitting
2873080	2876920	there quietly, resenting the other person for not agreeing with everything
2876920	2880680	you're saying, it's so fundamentally like, what are your experience?
2880800	2881080	Yeah.
2881080	2881520	Yes.
2881520	2884400	I heard you and Justin, um, at that one rock library.
2884400	2885280	That was amazing.
2885280	2890600	Feels so good knowing that you guys like, you have to pull rank in a, in a, in a
2890600	2893240	format sense, but this is essentially a sketch show.
2893240	2898440	I know you guys do larger things, but like fucking story breaking, like if it's,
2898440	2900880	it's like, it's an exercise in frustration.
2900880	2903160	It's an Asperger friendly format.
2903160	2906720	It's like, but then it's like, like, like, like, like not when I say Asperger friendly,
2906720	2909560	I don't mean that it, I don't mean that it's like, it causes joy.
2909880	2914080	It's just like, but it's like, you have to have an attention surplus to story
2914080	2914400	break.
2914400	2918040	If you have an attention deficit, and I'm not saying that anyone clinically does
2919040	2919720	Justin.
2921520	2923440	Like, I mean, he's like fart too tight.
2923440	2926720	Just farted fucking fart, Mike, Mike, Mike.
2927760	2930560	But Justin is like, like, you guys have hung out with Justin.
2930560	2935160	Like these, these, his genius is from his fucking, like, he cannot like, he
2935160	2936840	gets bored so quickly.
2936840	2937640	So bored.
2937840	2938840	You get so bored.
2939960	2940640	Bored guy.
2940760	2941920	Rob Strauss back, everybody.
2941920	2942400	Welcome back.
2942400	2946320	Hey, Rob, do you want to tell us briefly about your adventures while you were away?
2946520	2953520	Yeah, I got a delicious, actually incredibly refreshing, sprite drink from the
2953520	2956920	concession area over there.
2957600	2965920	I they offered not to let me pay for it, but I gave him a tip anyway.
2965920	2966600	That was fun.
2966600	2969480	And then I saw Abed Gaeth there.
2969480	2970400	We shook hands.
2971400	2973080	I think Abed had a, had a thing.
2973080	2976480	Like, like, like I invited him to the show because he had a thing you wanted to talk
2976480	2976960	about.
2977080	2978800	Oh, you fucking started burping.
2978800	2980760	That was gross to see that this close.
2980800	2982600	When you burp, do you also pee?
2982600	2983160	What happens?
2984160	2984920	What happens?
2984920	2987160	What do you have a free Stooges bathroom?
2988160	2990320	Not everything is connected to a lateral thing.
2990520	2992440	I don't always fart when I cough.
2992440	2995960	Does that mean I thought we're trying to find out what the how the plumbing works?
2996000	3000600	Doesn't it doesn't everyone every once in a while while you're coughing fart?
3000640	3002320	Doesn't isn't that something that happens?
3002320	3010640	It's my my question was when that happens and you're one foot from someone, do what
3011640	3016960	is your like, like, do you say if you cough and fart, you should disclose that I farted.
3016960	3019040	So you're not trying to bury the lead on that one.
3019040	3021400	Yeah, I think you're being a good, a good person for that.
3021400	3024400	But sometimes you then the context can come in.
3024400	3027280	Like you could be on a first date, like just try not to cough.
3027280	3027760	I guess.
3028960	3032640	Coughs are dangerous or turn up the music, but you know what, first dates.
3032640	3034080	That's the, what am I talking about?
3034400	3037000	Fucking first date, if that's what's going to happen.
3037000	3044200	That was that was the chair and that was the chair who's chair now you do the first
3044200	3045080	thing is the first date.
3045080	3047320	Then we go, I swear to God, it's a fucking chair, baby.
3049840	3052280	Wait, what am I curious about with with the animals?
3052440	3053880	What kind of animals did you get?
3053920	3057720	No, this is what I'm really curious about as a writer, because I know because I've
3057720	3058400	seen the show.
3058680	3061280	A lot of these people probably people have actually seen it.
3061360	3062520	Yeah, cool.
3062880	3063360	Great.
3063640	3064520	It's thank you.
3064960	3066960	That's not enough for the list.
3066960	3072080	Listeners that only are hearing this podcast out on audio, more people raise their hands
3072080	3072600	than claps.
3073320	3074360	I didn't specify.
3074360	3080120	So yeah, when I am curious about because it's got that very organic style, it's
3080120	3082520	obviously clearly a lot of improv happening.
3082520	3086320	And I'm very curious because you guys have all these, you have a list like comedy people
3086320	3090360	coming in to the Starburns recording booth in beautiful downtown Burbank.
3090840	3096280	What a listers Aziz Ansari, Chelsea, Perretti, Molly Shannon, just
3096960	3099600	Dane, Danny McBride, me and Zukas.
3099600	3100320	Yeah, Kroll.
3101600	3104040	John Lovett is a good friend of mine now.
3106320	3107360	Yeah, great friend.
3107400	3109440	He's he's he's got to come on this show.
3109720	3111120	He's so awesome.
3111680	3113080	Like he was unbelievable.
3113200	3113680	Thank you, buddy.
3114280	3116480	But but so the question is, are you going to kill me?
3118920	3120160	Like really do drunk.
3120200	3121400	And it's just there.
3121400	3123800	There's a contentiousness coming from that general vicinity.
3125040	3125440	Sorry.
3125640	3130960	It's it's also it's magnified, though, when you're under lights and you when you hear voices from out
3130960	3136360	there, it the the that dynamic adds 10 pounds of content.
3136360	3137720	Yeah, yeah.
3137760	3139480	So maybe I'm hearing it wrong.
3139520	3142280	Because you always are thinking, like, why am I talking to a microphone?
3142280	3146320	If you hear anybody could be going like, I'm diabetic, and I'm going into shock right now.
3146320	3146800	Or something like that.
3147080	3147840	Just hear a voice.
3147840	3149000	You're like, hey, fuck you, lady.
3150120	3151320	Shut the fuck up.
3152320	3154600	Because you just hear the word shock and you're like, shock.
3154640	3155240	Fuck you.
3155520	3157120	I don't care about your politically correct bullshit.
3157840	3158880	What do you want to trigger warnings?
3158880	3159960	He's like, no, I need insulin.
3161560	3162080	Shocking.
3162120	3166440	Oh, I shouldn't have done that.
3166480	3168440	No, I stop stop.
3168480	3173320	Don't I because I want to finish because I had an actual I did this as a first for me.
3173320	3176640	I have an actual question for people I'm interviewing that I'm actually interested in.
3176680	3181200	Well, I really want to know, like, like, Rob, how's your sprite?
3181240	3181840	Is it delicious?
3182480	3183240	It's really good.
3183960	3184880	It looks really good.
3184920	3185840	It's still chilled.
3185880	3187320	Cold, cold and refreshing.
3187360	3189200	I prefer it in the aluminum can.
3189200	3191400	I'm more of a seven up guy, but you like, you like sprite?
3191600	3196200	I prefer seven up, but it's just not as common as you prefer seven up.
3197240	3201280	Here's something that I noticed on a, on a, who's that guy?
3201320	3205360	Let's segue into a new, what's this guy, Liv Schreiber.
3205360	3206240	Liv Schreiber.
3206320	3207160	Liv Schreiber.
3207160	3207680	Yeah.
3207720	3208640	Do you know who I'm talking to?
3208640	3209200	Liv Schreiber.
3209320	3209840	Liv Schreiber.
3209840	3210360	Liv Schreiber.
3210360	3211760	He always looks put off.
3211880	3217040	He came up and he went, he went for, he went, because he said, because he said it.
3217040	3217560	He said it.
3217560	3219600	He's got, we lost dance Rob.
3220160	3223520	I was gonna, I wasn't even gonna bring up because it was such a new ass thing
3223640	3227520	because Liv Schreiber came out and he, I said to Cody, I was watching the Oscars
3227520	3232040	because Liv Schreiber said like, uh, he said like, uh, production design is very
3232040	3236840	important in Hollywood and when he said it, his face looked like he really, the
3236840	3239640	reason he was saying it is like, I don't get why.
3239960	3242200	Like he was, it was a pet peeve of his.
3242720	3245960	Like, like, as if he was saying, like, like, like, like, like, like, like
3245960	3248840	misogyny is as American as apple pie.
3248840	3252520	Like he, like, he was like making a, like he was being like upset.
3253000	3256440	It was like, like production design is, and he was like, like, it was like Liv
3256440	3258920	Schreiber has some, something's going on with him.
3258920	3260520	He's, he's very put off.
3260520	3262680	Maybe he's nearsighted and he's having trouble with the prompter.
3262680	3266560	It could be, but I also, there's a Benizio del Toro looking amused is the
3266560	3268760	most terrifying he's ever looked, which could be the secret of this thing.
3268760	3271000	He might look in the mirror and like somebody makes him laugh.
3271080	3272720	He goes like, Oh God, that's not good.
3272720	3275200	Benizio, we caught him tonight.
3275200	3277440	Cause they did a prop bit with a bear and the cut back to him.
3277440	3281920	And he was like, and it was like, Oh, Benizio mystery.
3285120	3288760	Do you think he thought it was like a Wolfman reference?
3288760	3291440	And he was like, yeah, he's an actor.
3291440	3293720	He, he thought like, what does a cat think?
3293720	3298480	When you run the can opener, you know, he thought, he thought there's
3298480	3302080	food, like, or are there any actors in the audience?
3302080	3302480	I'm sorry.
3302480	3307000	So Dan, Dan, you were making a point just before that.
3307560	3308080	I would know.
3308080	3311960	I wanted to interview our fucking guests for one question.
3311960	3313560	This is not a tangent.
3313560	3317040	I, the reason that I was talking about what's his leave, leave, live.
3317040	3318080	What does he pronounce?
3318080	3321800	Leave Schreiber, he looks like he smells like cherry seven up.
3324240	3325880	Can he look like he smells like him?
3326400	3328280	He looks like he smells like cherry seven.
3328280	3329760	I haven't been next to him.
3329760	3333320	So I can't, I look at him on TV and I, that's what they do.
3333320	3335280	And they might smell like cherry seven up.
3335280	3335760	They do that.
3335760	3336520	Let's exercise.
3336520	3337480	They do an art school.
3337480	3338720	They got the professor rocks and girls.
3338800	3342600	I want you to draw something that looks like it smells like something.
3343080	3343440	Mr.
3343440	3344720	Shrob, what are you?
3346520	3351080	Do you have any, do you have something better to do than, than draw
3351080	3352840	something that smells like something?
3354200	3355640	What is it you're drawing?
3356520	3358200	Share it with the class.
3358280	3361720	It's a perfect drawing.
3361720	3363520	It's drawing robots.
3364320	3365640	It's Liv's tribe or two a T.
3366640	3371560	Man, it's so weird being inside of a Harmon town and just having it happen around you.
3373080	3381320	My question was when you guys, and I, because there's, it's a ton of organic
3381320	3385160	improvised kind of material, you guys have both parties in a booth.
3385160	3386480	If you're doing a two person scene, right?
3386480	3387360	And they go back and forth.
3387360	3388320	And we're in it too.
3388360	3391320	What do the scripts look like when they're ready to be recorded?
3391440	3396080	It's like 12 to 15 pages and it has just general scene breakdowns.
3396080	3400360	And then like a few sentences for each beat that we need to get to.
3400360	3404680	And then also kind of an idea of maybe the joke that needs to land at a minimum.
3404680	3405000	Yeah.
3405000	3407000	We'll tell them at the front and sit down with them.
3407000	3408040	This is what happens.
3408040	3411240	You're a tiny turtle and then a frog, a mechanical frog,
3411640	3412960	which we've heard rumors about.
3412960	3415520	Maybe that's probably similar to what a Kirby or enthusiasm.
3416320	3416560	Yeah.
3416560	3417320	That's what we heard.
3417320	3421040	Mark two plus was on the league and that shows very similar in that kind of case.
3421040	3424200	So he was able to transpose a lot of stuff from that into our show.
3424440	3425520	But yeah, we're in the booth.
3425520	3429000	That's one of the main selling points of Starburns.
3429000	3433600	I think in general is you guys have the biggest booth, um, which is so insane.
3434480	3437240	We've had eight people in there at once.
3437480	3442040	How big is the, like, like, like, like from the stage, even bigger than that.
3442040	3444000	Probably from that thing to that it's huge.
3444720	3446200	That's a big booth.
3450040	3456120	That is a big booth in my biopic.
3456120	3460240	When I'm starting my studio and I'm going like, I want the booth to be big.
3460280	3463600	And they're like, well, then the sound camera, sound is everything.
3463960	3465480	Podcasts are everything.
3465520	3467200	We need a podcast friendly booth.
3467320	3469000	Put politicians in on wheels.
3469000	3470480	If the people need to be compressed.
3470720	3476040	I was like, and I want these rivets to be flush, flush, flush, flush booth in the
3476040	3476920	fucking city.
3476960	3478200	What actor is playing you?
3478240	3479240	What actor is playing you?
3479240	3481480	What country or the caprio?
3481480	3484640	So he did an accent to make sure he's nominated for something.
3486160	3490160	Even, even though I'm not Southern, he just had to add something Leo wins.
3490160	3491480	You know, he did.
3491480	3492720	He won best actor for evidence.
3494160	3496000	Also who gives a shit?
3496000	3497560	It's true to him.
3497560	3502840	So Tom Hardy, he's like, I did the exact same thing he did for an entire movie.
3505080	3507600	Who won best director in utero?
3509040	3509400	Really?
3509400	3509600	Yeah.
3509880	3511120	Wait, who was it?
3511160	3512080	A Mexican one.
3513040	3513520	Oh boy.
3514120	3514800	Revenant dude.
3515000	3515920	This guy's so solid.
3515920	3516280	It's okay.
3516280	3519040	This guy, you said racist earlier.
3519040	3523000	And now you said Mexican and you've got a handsome Latino vibe to you.
3523960	3526000	They're like, thank you.
3526760	3529040	Wait, who, who won the, who's the best director?
3529720	3531880	Oh, is it the Revenant guy?
3532040	3532360	Okay.
3532360	3532640	Yeah.
3532640	3535680	And that is a, he did the, uh, what else did he do?
3535680	3538440	He did the, I'm pointing at the Latino guy.
3538440	3539560	What else did your friend do?
3539640	3540200	Okay.
3541400	3544480	How do you, I got something here to say.
3544480	3549520	So how do you, how does Mad Max get best production designer, best sound, best
3549520	3552080	editing, best others, best, sweeps everything.
3552320	3556920	And the guy that told all those people to do that, the director doesn't get best
3556920	3557520	director.
3557640	3559160	How the fuck does that happen?
3560120	3560600	Good point.
3560640	3561960	Because you're still accountable.
3561960	3563040	People think you're a prick.
3563040	3563840	So watch it.
3563960	3566040	Oh, good point too.
3566040	3566400	No, I know.
3566400	3568200	I don't think anyone thought George Miller was a prick.
3568200	3569040	I thought that would get a laugh.
3569040	3569960	I thought I would get a laugh.
3570480	3571080	Doesn't make any sense.
3571080	3571680	Fuck you.
3572560	3574080	You just saw being manipulatable.
3574120	3577520	You guys just saw right now, uh, what a producer is and what a director is.
3580400	3580880	Very true.
3580880	3581320	Very true.
3581560	3582200	But okay.
3582840	3583520	What, what, yeah.
3583520	3584880	What, and what, what's the other movie?
3584880	3587360	The Birdman, Birdman, Birdman.
3587360	3587880	God damn it.
3587880	3588000	Yeah.
3588000	3589600	Birdman, Birdman, Gravity.
3589600	3589800	Yeah.
3589840	3591000	No, he's, he's awesome.
3591040	3591800	Gravity sucks.
3592160	3594400	Uh, don't get me fucking going on.
3594400	3599240	I think, uh, yeah, I think there needs to be a new stereotype about, uh, uh,
3599280	3600280	Mexican directors.
3601080	3603520	Is it, is it all, all Madavar is Mexican, right?
3603520	3604200	Is he, yeah.
3604320	3605080	Or is he Spanish?
3605680	3606040	Okay.
3606120	3607360	See, new stereotype.
3607360	3607920	Let's start it.
3608000	3609560	Mexicans, great directors.
3610560	3613280	Although a lot of them have an extra muscle in their eyeball.
3614080	3618640	A lot of, a lot of Mexico sending a lot of the rapist directors up here.
3619840	3620040	Yes.
3620040	3621200	Mexicans, great directors.
3621240	3623080	And I'm sure some of them are nice people.
3623080	3623240	Yeah.
3624680	3626040	A lot of rapists, a lot of criminals.
3626040	3629280	We have to put a direct size hole in a wall around America.
3629880	3632360	There used to be a director shaped hole in that wall.
3632400	3633880	We're going to build a beautiful lens.
3635040	3637480	It's going to be very, very, very good lens.
3637800	3640120	I'm going to talk to the best lens makers ever.
3640720	3641920	And I'm a negotiator.
3641920	3643160	I've done a very good job.
3643160	3647080	I've made lenses for things I've gotten awards for their scenes.
3647120	3649160	Is this, is this Leo DiCaprio playing this character too?
3650160	3651640	Leo DiCaprio in Trump.
3651720	3652240	Uh, yeah.
3652680	3653440	Oh my God.
3654360	3656280	I'm going to very, very do the thing.
3656760	3660560	Uh, Spencer, who would you cast as Dan Harmon in the Dan Harmon biopic?
3660600	3661600	Judd Apatow.
3664160	3665360	Who would that be the actor?
3665880	3667440	I think he has the chops.
3668800	3669000	Yeah.
3669000	3672960	But I think Robert Downey Jr's, just go with the, go with the obvious choice.
3673000	3673560	Yeah.
3673560	3674800	Dan, stop shaming.
3674800	3676440	Stop being a producer for one second.
3676440	3678760	Let's just go with RDJ.
3678760	3680680	If it works, it's obvious.
3680680	3684760	Mike and Phil, who would you, who would you cast, uh, as like as Dan Harmon?
3684760	3687960	If you had to make a biopic, if you had anybody you wanted all the budget.
3690720	3694760	You know, for people who have an improvised show, we should have had a joke
3694760	3695760	ready at hand.
3695760	3698120	I was, I was looking for Andy Barcio out.
3698120	3699520	Let's bring it into your wheelhouse.
3699520	3701680	But what animal should I play when I do your show?
3701720	3702120	Oh yeah.
3702120	3703400	Oh, it's gotta be New York city-based.
3703400	3705760	Probably a dog, like some sort of, like your dog.
3706000	3706560	That'd be good.
3706560	3707880	Like which bro, a golden doodle.
3707920	3709080	Yeah, that'd be fun.
3709120	3709560	I'm in.
3709800	3714040	Although I've spiritually, I am not that this would make it a funny sketch, just
3714040	3715520	to make me, but a sea otter.
3715520	3717040	I've always seen myself as a sea otter.
3717160	3717600	Yeah.
3717600	3719920	They float on their back and they eat food on their stomach.
3719920	3723760	And then, and they're just like, yeah, chilling.
3724000	3726760	And they, but they don't build dams, but they're almost, they're almost beavers,
3726760	3727800	but they don't work that hard.
3727800	3731600	And they're just like, and then it's like, what's that?
3731880	3732040	Yeah.
3732040	3735920	When they have sex, they, uh, grab on to the female's nose and rip off their
3735920	3736600	nose sometimes.
3737120	3737440	Wow.
3737440	3737920	Whoa.
3738160	3738520	Kinky.
3738520	3739600	I hate when that happens.
3739600	3740320	Otters do that?
3741720	3742120	Okay.
3742120	3746000	Uh, they rip off the woman's, they rip off their woman's snout.
3747360	3747760	Right.
3747840	3748440	Right.
3749040	3751000	They should stop swimming and just fuck.
3752880	3753360	Hold on, baby.
3753360	3754840	Do that shit on dry land.
3754840	3755840	You know what I'm saying?
3756560	3760880	Swim the shore and start doing, don't have to be biting on the nose.
3760880	3762240	It should get on the beach.
3763120	3764160	Do that otter foot.
3764160	3766960	Start swimming, swimming, trying to swim.
3766960	3767600	Fuck, man.
3767600	3769280	Rob, Rob, get on the beach.
3769320	3771680	Rob has a side thing that stand up said about otters.
3771720	3772760	Uh, it's just pretty good.
3772840	3774040	I'll bite in the nose.
3774120	3775600	Get on the beach and fuck.
3776120	3779600	Why are you fucking in the water?
3780320	3782240	Get on the beach and fuck.
3782720	3787040	Well, you didn't have more out of nose per capita.
3787080	3787680	Dan, I'm sorry.
3787680	3788760	I think Rob's got the part.
3788800	3789480	That was pretty.
3789600	3793480	Yeah, Rob just had to hit for the otter.
3793480	3795760	I'll be, I'll be a golden doodle.
3795760	3796000	I'm fine.
3796200	3799360	Would you, what, what, what, what, what do you, anything else you guys want to pump
3799360	3799520	out?
3799520	3803120	Cause the thing is I gotta, I guess there's another guy that I gotta get up here.
3803320	3808040	So just, you know, let's watch the ever, if we could, it's on HBO Go.
3808040	3808800	It's on HBO.
3808800	3811200	Now it comes out a day before Fridays.
3811440	3814800	So every Thursday, if you're at work or whatever, there's a new episode out.
3815120	3819160	And I think our show is going to have to be a word of mouth sort of thing.
3819400	3827120	So the more, yeah, we just need cool people to tell other cool people about it.
3827120	3828040	This is the room we want.
3828040	3831560	I know it's on HBO, but we're not getting enough stuff.
3831560	3832640	It's not for old people.
3832640	3835000	It's for young people, old people, two seasons.
3835000	3837400	If they get three, that's helpful for everybody.
3837400	3840840	Cause it's like, actually like, just like, it is a really funny show and it's like
3840840	3842640	everybody having fun and it's awesome.
3842640	3843600	And it's like, yeah.
3843600	3847840	And we get to hire, yeah, we get to hire all these awesome, cool people who all
3847840	3851520	have their fingerprints on the show and we all get to work music people too.
3851520	3853080	We got curvil, yeah.
3853080	3857280	Sap Rocky, it's up for, um, so it's a fun eclectic mix.
3857640	3859600	What style, what style of animation is it?
3859600	3860480	Like how are you doing it?
3860520	3864840	We're doing it in, um, uh, harmony and it's, it's, uh, people call it like low
3864840	3869280	fi cause the mouths don't move for anything and it's kind of stop motiony in
3869280	3873520	a way, but, um, it's a really weird eclectic mix.
3873520	3876200	Like some of our backgrounds are photo-realistic looking.
3876240	3878360	It's a mixture of high art and low art.
3878520	3879200	Hi.
3881200	3884920	Little on the nose, little on the nose, like a beaver, like a
3884920	3887320	we'll see how it affects on the nose.
3887320	3888480	It was a little on the nose.
3889480	3890080	Thank you.
3890160	3890480	All right.
3890480	3891000	Well, thanks.
3891000	3891920	Thanks so much guys.
3891920	3892680	Thank you guys.
3895360	3896800	Fridays at 11 30.
3896800	3906000	It's on slightly earlier on HBO go and then that drives traffic to the HBO go
3906000	3911720	plus turnstile, which makes a wheel spin, which I think universal then makes a
3911720	3915240	chicken pop an egg and then you get a free don't pop quiz.
3915960	3918000	Who is the one sitting closer to you?
3919200	3919480	Okay.
3919480	3920640	I got to flip it.
3920640	3921560	Cause okay.
3921680	3926080	Uh, it was, this was Phil, right?
3926520	3926960	You did it.
3927120	3930480	Yeah, but I had to flip it three times to remember it.
3930840	3933640	It's not about, it's not about me being a bad person.
3933640	3936240	I just, but my therapist said, stop.
3937040	3938200	Here's what my therapist told me.
3938440	3943440	She said, you, you back yourself into a corner because that's where you have
3943440	3949440	won your greatest victories because you were in your youth were in an environment
3949760	3953880	where you were backed into a corner for real and nobody else around you
3953880	3958000	understands because they look at you and they go, that's a six foot tall fucking
3958000	3963320	bear guy like that has no, that no one wants to do anything bad too.
3963320	3965880	And from their perception, you're just a dick.
3966160	3971680	Like, like, like, because what I'm like, I'm going like, I'm using, I'm like, I'll
3971680	3975680	actually like pull people, I'll trick them into like cornering me and then I'll
3975680	3977840	go, I'm in a corner.
3977840	3978800	Thanks for joining me.
3978800	3983160	Hey, what?
3983160	3986480	And I got blood all over my face and everyone's like, you're such a dick.
3986760	3988200	And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
3988200	3989120	I was outnumbered.
3990360	3993000	And they're like, no, you dragged them into a corner.
3993000	3994560	That's what a serial killer does.
3995400	3997200	I'm going, I'm working through it in therapy.
3997200	3998520	I'm realizing all this now.
3998520	3999840	I'm crying every week.
4000040	4001360	I'm crying every week.
4008800	4013280	Are you crying happy or crying sad?
4013280	4017320	Like, just fucking like, what is beyond that, Jeff?
4017320	4019440	That's the binary heteronormative shit.
4019480	4023520	What if I can, my fucking tears are just pure fucking energy.
4023560	4027440	Are you saying it's like, is it epiphanic tears?
4027440	4028960	It's like, it's all of the above.
4028960	4030840	It's like, it's like, oh shit, she's right.
4030960	4031560	Tears.
4031760	4032000	Right.
4032000	4033640	Like, it's a, you're not happy or sad.
4033640	4034880	You're like fucking, that's it.
4034880	4037760	Dan, I cry like three times a week.
4038560	4039760	In fact, all right.
4042760	4046080	Our next guest is gay.
4048120	4050560	Who has never cried until Dan just said that.
4053640	4055520	You guys don't react.
4055880	4059160	You, you, you, you, I'm not going to, I'm not going to make you corner me.
4059880	4062240	I'm just going to say you're dumb for not laughing at that.
4065440	4066520	That's my judgment of you.
4066600	4070600	Put yourselves in your, all right.
4071440	4071760	All right.
4071760	4072560	So, so.
4077040	4078480	He almost certainly ruined that.
4080440	4083840	Our, uh, what's, what, what is, is, is Abed here?
4083840	4084680	Abed, are you here?
4085280	4086040	Abed, good.
4087240	4087640	Okay.
4090440	4091080	Oh, Abed.
4094400	4095600	Abed, I haven't seen you in a while.
4096600	4099840	You're looking, you're looking, uh, cause I don't have a job and I'm broke.
4100040	4101200	Well, okay.
4101200	4103240	Well, it's, it looks good.
4103240	4103720	I'm trying to.
4103720	4105960	Can I have some of your, uh, delicious vodka?
4105960	4106480	Yes, of course.
4106480	4107200	I'm excited.
4107240	4111120	You and I are always like, you and I have, well, I don't want to insult you by saying
4111120	4111240	this.
4111240	4114560	I think me, me slightly more, but you and I are always fluctuating.
4114920	4116240	Like, I never know what I see you.
4116240	4120040	You could look like a, you, you said last time that I lost weight, which was very
4120040	4120520	flattering.
4120520	4123520	Maybe every, maybe I just, maybe every time I see you, I just think you look good.
4123760	4124400	Oh, thank you.
4124640	4125360	Well, you look good too.
4125360	4126800	Actually, you're looking great.
4126840	4127760	This is real Abed.
4128080	4130720	Uh, but don't let the name fool you.
4130720	4134720	I feel like the character I made for community is more dimensional.
4142240	4144560	But no, when's the last time we hung out?
4144560	4145360	It was a while ago.
4145400	4145840	I don't know.
4145840	4146080	I know.
4146080	4149640	I just needed to siphon off some character points and then I went off to NBC.
4149680	4151280	So it's been like six years.
4151440	4153240	Should I sit next to Rob or is that?
4153320	4154720	No, no, no, I think this is fine.
4154920	4156880	I have a, I have a question.
4156880	4162400	Uh, how, how, how are you doing after not being the, uh, the dictator of Cuba?
4162520	4163280	Are you doing that?
4163280	4163640	Just
4167320	4168040	Hey, what?
4168040	4168880	Things going okay.
4174320	4177840	I was going to say like, I'm like, I try, I lost weight.
4177840	4181640	And then I was like, I need like a cool look that makes me attractive.
4181640	4185200	And I was like, you know, I don't like my head or I look like him.
4185560	4188400	And I was like, I was like, I need something.
4188960	4195360	So I decided, I decided, uh, I did something like, I have this hat from like this thing
4195360	4197520	I made called the pop shots fired.
4197520	4197960	Bluto.
4199600	4199920	Yeah.
4199960	4201960	No, well, what can we take off your hat?
4201960	4203320	I want to see your, okay.
4203320	4203560	Yeah.
4203560	4203880	Okay.
4205560	4206160	You got me.
4206160	4206960	You got me.
4207440	4208000	What is that?
4208000	4208440	What is that?
4208440	4212800	So you're saying, so what, but you, you do look good with the hat, but what, like, how
4212800	4215800	do you, how do you, wait, but how do you, what are your feelings about, cause I've
4215800	4218920	been friends with shrub for fucking 30 million years.
4220040	4226360	Like shrub really long time shrub started shrub was when I met him, shrub was, was,
4226360	4233200	was going, he was a bald guy, but he was like young and through my friendship with
4233200	4239000	him, I actually like became like, I was like, like, like, I didn't even realize what
4239000	4243280	it's like, like, like the attention we're paying and like how it feels and all the
4243280	4244680	different perspectives and all that stuff.
4245000	4250400	And so I'm just, I'm curious, like you're wearing a hat because you're saying like,
4250440	4255440	oh, I look better with the hat on and it's because the fact that your bald is covered
4255440	4259040	or because the hat is like a better looking thing than hair.
4259200	4264000	In the forties, everyone wore hats and so bald people kind of look like everyone else.
4264040	4264400	Right.
4264440	4266080	And I want to look like everyone else.
4266600	4268720	Like I want to be attractive and cool.
4268720	4272320	And people with people with people with hair were happy is happening.
4274120	4277680	This is like, I feel like we're at therapy right now, but I mean, like, it's a crazy
4277680	4280040	reunion because I'm going to pay for this for you to go to therapy.
4280040	4282480	All three of the therapy.
4282480	4284000	I want to look like everybody else.
4284000	4285200	I want to be attractive.
4285280	4289840	I just like, I don't know, like sometimes you meet somebody and they go, oh, you're
4289840	4291680	bald, you're inadequate.
4292200	4296880	I just feel like if I have the hat and I just go, you know, I'm going to start.
4297760	4300120	This is everything you've ever wanted.
4301720	4306320	Look, man, like I was like, like, like, like karma, karma fucking happens.
4307120	4311000	And like, like 10 minutes before I have to go to Kate show.
4311000	4312440	So make it good.
4312640	4313600	Let's wrap this up.
4313600	4313960	Yeah.
4314760	4315720	Wrap this up in 10 minutes.
4315720	4316560	Fun for somebody.
4316560	4316880	All right.
4316880	4321160	Well, let's put a pin in the hat conversation because they guys, because it's like obvious
4321160	4322520	when we watch like, like, what was it?
4322520	4324960	What was that guy in like a bus of love or whatever?
4324960	4328000	The fucking like heavy metal guy was like, yes.
4328160	4331840	I was like, Brett Michaels, it was like, there's like certain personalities that we
4331840	4336640	see where they have like a scarf and it's like, Jesus Christ, this guy wants to make
4336640	4341600	us think he's the scarf is super desperate from wearing like a Clark Kent, like fucking
4341920	4346360	like, yeah, like from an era when everyone I tried doing that, I tried doing that.
4346360	4349160	And then I think Justin said, dude, you look like a douchebag.
4349680	4352520	He's like, don't be that guy that comes with that hat.
4352520	4354320	And I was like, shit, he's right.
4354320	4357320	I want to try as hard as I can to not care about physical things.
4357320	4361600	But I guess, I mean, I you're the you're you look great.
4362360	4364240	Shit, I'm I'm super excited.
4364240	4365800	And maybe it is the Castro thing.
4365800	4370880	Maybe you look like you look like a young Middle Eastern Hemingway.
4370880	4373320	Like, I'll take it.
4373440	4375120	I will take it. I would read.
4375120	4377480	I would read a novel that you wrote.
4377480	4379240	All right. So, you're on a high.
4379240	4381800	So I brought you here because you texted me.
4381840	4383640	You had a birthday recently.
4383640	4387200	That was, yeah, Justin's idea, by the way, to have a birthday party.
4387280	4391680	Well, no, like I was kind of like I told him the story and then he goes, text Dan,
4392000	4393600	tell him about it. Oh, yeah.
4393600	4396600	Oh, yeah. You tell Justin.
4396600	4399240	I said, I promised him that I would give him credit.
4399240	4401920	No, I just want credit for, you know, inspiring you.
4401920	4404800	Because because you texted me and said, what's Jeff doing over there?
4404840	4406760	He's I'm ordering a beer.
4406760	4408880	Oh, OK. Classic, classic, Jeff.
4408880	4410520	So I didn't go to your birthday party.
4410520	4412400	Apologies. You had a karaoke place.
4412400	4413520	It was interesting.
4413520	4415720	I mean, you're you're like down the street.
4415720	4418280	I was like thinking like because Ridley came.
4418280	4422240	Yeah, but it's like there's a lot of oh, there was just construction.
4422720	4424120	No, I mean, that's true.
4424120	4425600	Well, I don't I've never seen.
4425600	4427720	I mean, I've seen you sing a karaoke.
4427720	4429320	But it's a new environment.
4429320	4430440	There's a lot of weirdos there.
4430440	4432640	I you would probably be uncomfortable.
4432640	4434000	I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah.
4434000	4437120	You know, because it's like people will be judging you all over the place,
4437120	4439640	you know, like on your song choice.
4439640	4441880	Well, I mean, I
4443080	4446560	Dan does pretty well in karaoke because you have like some wheelhouse songs.
4446560	4447680	You can get up there and he does.
4447680	4449240	He does a great George Michael.
4449240	4452920	Yeah, his faith is fucking I'm a big fan of that version, by the way.
4452920	4454960	Like so you texted me and you said.
4455960	4458800	Are you is Jeff going to be on the show on Sunday?
4458800	4460160	Oh, yeah, he's in the show.
4460160	4464560	And you said because he was at my birthday party and some shit went down.
4464560	4466040	And I think it would make a good story.
4466040	4469080	And I said, why don't you come to the show and talk about it?
4469080	4470840	And I didn't want to hear anything about it.
4470840	4473080	And I texted Jeff and said,
4473960	4476440	I've come to the show, he says some shit went down.
4476440	4478920	And Jeff was like, that's going to take a minute to talk about it.
4478920	4482920	And I said, yeah, but I've been trying to explain something.
4483320	4485920	Is Abed at his most societally?
4485920	4489480	Oh, yeah, especially if Rob Shrobs on stage when it's happening.
4489480	4491560	No, yeah, I totally forgot.
4491560	4493520	Yeah, so Rob was probably going to be here.
4493520	4494960	Curtain up. Second, think that.
4494960	4498760	So now I've drawn a framework and he's going to be here's Abed explaining
4498760	4500680	some stuff, know nothing about this.
4500680	4502440	Some shit went down.
4502440	4503800	Well, it was crazy.
4503800	4505720	I mean, I was super drunk, first of all.
4505720	4509440	And then, like, I mean, the first moment when we started that party
4509880	4512240	in Burbank, shout out.
4512240	4513680	And Jeff comes in.
4513680	4515480	Shout out to Burbank.
4515480	4518720	Right. And this show is about Burbank, all Burbank.
4519040	4520080	So Jeff comes in.
4520080	4522000	I was like super excited that he came.
4522000	4524160	I've been trying to get Jeff to come to the show for a while.
4524160	4526440	I mean, to that that karaoke for a while,
4526440	4528760	because there's like some insane characters there.
4528760	4529800	There's a guy.
4529800	4532520	He dresses like Bono and he only does Bono songs.
4533440	4536680	And then there's a guy that's like got a giant beard, like a white beard.
4536680	4537760	And he's a coal miner guy.
4537760	4539560	And he sings cowboy songs.
4539560	4541160	And you just it's like waiting for guffman.
4541160	4544600	You just got to see these people or true stories like true stories.
4544800	4545960	You got to see these people.
4545960	4548000	And like, you're like, fuck, these people are amazing.
4548440	4552160	And so far, people who just dress like people and then sing like those.
4552200	4553600	Yeah, sing like those people.
4553600	4554840	But anyway, it's fun.
4554840	4557080	It's a fun time. I invited him.
4557080	4559520	He shows that I'm going to send me videos of these people.
4559520	4560560	And these people exist.
4560560	4562240	I've seen the videos of these people.
4562240	4563360	Which karaoke places this?
4563360	4565000	It's Holiday Inn in Burbank.
4565000	4566440	It's like Friday nights at night.
4566440	4568240	And it's like hardcore or is it?
4568240	4570600	Yeah, it's like there's all these regulars and they all go.
4570600	4572080	And now are they hardcore about it?
4572080	4573880	Like they're like, are they like good singers?
4573880	4575280	Yeah, there's really good singers.
4575280	4579600	They're dressing up like they're and they're all dressing up like one of those places.
4579600	4580920	Like there's a couple of places in L.A.
4580920	4582560	where you're like, this is hardcore karaoke.
4582560	4583600	These are regulars.
4583600	4585880	And I go because I never know what I'm going to see.
4585880	4588000	OK, all right. So jump into the myth.
4588000	4590000	None of this soft core stuff.
4590000	4590640	Yeah, yeah.
4590640	4593480	This is that's this is the Nazi Germany of Schindler's List.
4593480	4594880	Here comes the story now.
4595120	4596600	Take us further in.
4596600	4598600	You're setting it up so big.
4598600	4603880	All right. So anyway, I mean, we started off the top story, which is a cool bar
4603880	4605120	because you can see everything.
4605120	4607480	And then we went down the cool glass elevator and we go.
4607480	4609640	It's like this, like a Willy Wonka situation.
4609640	4612080	And then we go into the actual where they're doing the karaoke.
4612080	4613640	This is just a Yelp review right now.
4613640	4614160	It's a Yelp.
4614160	4617800	This is what happens to you when you any consumer that goes to this place.
4617800	4619440	Yeah, you have to go through the motions.
4619440	4621800	OK, so then we're there and it's like there's nobody there.
4621800	4622600	I'm all excited.
4622600	4624560	I'm like, all my friends are going to sing.
4624560	4625960	We're going to have a blast.
4625960	4629080	You know, like the night's starting off good and people are buying me drinks
4629080	4631400	because it's my birthday, which you take advantage of that.
4631400	4632640	Happy birthday. Thank you.
4632640	4634240	Do you want to tell us how old you are or do you be?
4634240	4637280	Oh, man. All right. I'm 37. Oh, that's great.
4637520	4638720	Now, come on. It's great.
4638720	4640280	It's the new twenty seven.
4640280	4641760	Yeah, you thought I was twenty seven.
4641760	4644000	No, I said it's the new twenty seven.
4644000	4646280	I don't. But if you told me you were twenty seven, I wouldn't put it.
4646280	4648880	Look at your thick black fucking marker beer.
4648880	4651600	A girl at that karaoke said I was twenty six.
4651600	4653000	So that's pretty. Yeah.
4653000	4655040	I mean, you probably didn't see that you were bald.
4655040	4657240	She would have thought you were nine hundred thousand years old.
4657240	4657760	I was wearing a hat.
4657760	4660440	Yeah, I was. Oh, shucks.
4660440	4662360	You got me. Well, so then.
4662360	4664120	No, I got shrub. I'm not trying to hurt you.
4664120	4665920	I'm trying to hurt shrub.
4665920	4668760	I I feel like you should be cutting in more.
4668760	4669960	He's like, is he all right?
4669960	4671800	He'll find you're doing OK.
4671800	4672680	All right. Well, so anyway.
4672680	4674840	Anyway, anyway, the night is going great.
4674840	4677080	I mean, I put in I can't remember what song I put.
4677080	4680480	I had like I always have three songs in my pocket because I'm like one of these.
4680480	4682080	What? Wait, literally back.
4682080	4684160	Yeah, I mean, I think about what I'm going to sing.
4684160	4685440	I'm sweet. But but but not.
4685440	4688520	But you're patting your pocket to like, I'm showing you that like I have.
4688520	4690080	Like they're ready to go.
4690080	4691040	You mean in your head.
4691040	4693120	You don't. Yeah, there's nothing in your pocket.
4693120	4696080	How did your pocket just look like I write down the song?
4696080	4698920	He's saying he means he writes down three that he has ready to go.
4698920	4700800	What you actually write him down on a slip of paper.
4700800	4703800	Yeah. Yeah. And I just weird, weird, weird.
4703800	4705960	That's how it works. Already weird.
4705960	4707080	Already weird.
4707080	4708040	Are you being sarcastic?
4708040	4710400	Because I do think that's weird. Yeah, it is weird.
4710400	4713800	It is. You have to write him down on a slip of paper before you get there.
4715280	4716280	I'm asking him.
4716280	4720000	No, I kept one from last time because I had one from last time I didn't do.
4720000	4722600	So I kept it proved to me right now that you don't have a song.
4722600	4724440	No, I wrote the same pants.
4724440	4726000	I mean, but they didn't got me.
4726000	4727320	I didn't watch them. All right, whatever.
4727320	4729520	Is there is there a chance of the song?
4729520	4732280	Is there a chance of the song like at large in your pocket right now?
4732720	4733960	No, there's not.
4733960	4736120	There might be one in my wallet, but I don't want to look.
4736120	4739280	I just wanted a record that it was important for me to focus in on that thing
4739280	4741160	because it's an important detail.
4741160	4743760	Callie, you're saying, oh, yeah, you have to write that was the chair.
4746000	4748320	It's all karaoke. You have to write a slip of paper.
4748320	4749760	No, it's very you.
4749760	4751680	You you're saying you literally.
4751680	4752200	He front loads.
4752200	4756840	You had unsung songs written on slips of paper in your pocket.
4756840	4760400	In case I get stumped and I need something like a reserve, I got it there.
4760440	4763280	Could be the like the like the teletype in tonight's Oscars.
4763400	4765600	Could be the best thing could be the worst thing.
4765600	4767960	I can't even tell. It's just at least you're innovating.
4767960	4772400	When when I've been doing that karaoke place for five weeks and everyone's good.
4772400	4775600	So I'm trying to like get I'm trying to compete with these people.
4775760	4778240	And I'm really trying to like bring my A game.
4778400	4781440	And so I have reserves because I'm like, oh, maybe I'll do better on Happy
4781440	4784680	Together, maybe Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious will be better.
4784680	4787120	Oh, always, always a fucking doozy.
4787280	4788720	Yeah, that's always a doozy.
4788720	4790480	That was hard, dude. That was hard.
4790480	4793480	You squeeze off a little Mario Poppins in a fucking hardcore.
4793520	4796360	You do. So you practice these songs at home?
4796360	4798280	No, I mean, I love very Poppins.
4798280	4800480	So that song is into my brain.
4800480	4804000	Like so you so you you memorize the song and that song will never.
4804000	4805400	So do it right now.
4805400	4807720	No, fuck that. No, never, never.
4807720	4808640	Now, come on.
4808640	4810880	Callifragilisticexpialidocious when you went over this.
4810880	4811960	It's really like atrocious.
4811960	4813760	That doesn't. OK, that's it.
4813760	4815800	The the the please stop doing it.
4815800	4816680	Yeah, thank you.
4816680	4818440	I try to show please stop.
4818440	4819360	Don't ever do that again.
4819360	4821800	Anyway, let's I keep getting distracted here.
4822120	4823920	So I'm OK.
4823920	4824680	I'm excited.
4824680	4827400	I think I put in Nina Cherry's Buffalo stance.
4827440	4828320	Oh, nice. Yeah.
4828320	4831000	Which is like one of my favorite, like it's like rap is easy.
4831000	4833240	You can just rap, you know, you don't have to sing good.
4833360	4834400	Well, it's not always easy.
4834400	4837640	I mean, no, I know it's not always easy, but but you can just be like.
4839840	4841440	You're you're
4842440	4843640	nice, nice try.
4843640	4847880	I mean, I mean, this guy, I'm doing this.
4847880	4849240	Here I go. But blue.
4849240	4851960	And it's like I was at I was at we were at karaoke in New York
4851960	4854760	and we had we rented one of those rooms in New York.
4854760	4856400	Karaoke can get gets more.
4856400	4859960	It gets more lost in translation because it's like it's New York
4859960	4862360	and it's compressed and it's like you go to like places
4862360	4867320	and it's more OG Asian style or like a little you're in a tiny room.
4867320	4868440	And yeah, this thing.
4868440	4872280	And there was a there was a there was a there was a young lady that came.
4872280	4873560	It was a friend of a friend.
4873560	4877400	And like she had clearly this is the first time I ever saw someone was like,
4877400	4881280	oh, well, you've prepped this like you've practiced doing karaoke before.
4881280	4882360	And this is like your hits.
4882360	4885200	And you really got to fucking wrap the fuck out of the bus to write.
4885200	4886720	She said she did like a bus drive.
4886720	4890000	So I must fucking blew the roof off and nailed it.
4890000	4893480	And I was like, OK, that's a new I never never looked at the words.
4893480	4895320	New at the whole. Yeah.
4895320	4897000	And I got you all in check that one.
4897000	4898680	I don't know. It doesn't matter.
4898680	4900280	Well, what does. OK. All right.
4900280	4902440	Well, I don't know why I'm saying it doesn't matter.
4902440	4904520	I interrupted. Continue your story.
4904520	4907480	Well, anyway, so then I think I went up pretty early.
4907720	4909200	And is he all right?
4909200	4911560	I think Trump has to go see us. Oh, all right.
4911560	4913920	Trump had a heart out. He's got to go to the story.
4913920	4918360	All right. Yeah, he's here later, but he's been disruptive and he should love him.
4918360	4919640	I love it. I love it.
4919640	4922000	I love it. He's my buddy.
4922000	4925360	Rob. Thank you. Rob.
4925360	4926960	Rob Strom, everybody.
4926960	4930640	He has to go. He has to start all the questions.
4930640	4932640	Be forgotten.
4932640	4934680	Oh, no, no.
4934680	4936680	Rob Strom.
4936680	4938680	He's Strom.
4938680	4940680	Strom.
4940680	4942680	Strom, he's Strom.
4942680	4944680	Oh, Rob Strom.
4947680	4950680	Now I want him to leave every week.
4950680	4953680	So he'll sing Old Exhine with Rob Strom in it.
4953680	4955680	It's a bit with Rob meeting. It's very exciting.
4955680	4956680	Yeah.
4956680	4958680	Oh, Rob Strom.
4958680	4962680	Oh, Rob Strom.
4962680	4964680	Rob Strom.
4964680	4966680	Rob Strom.
4966680	4968680	Rob Strom.
4968680	4971680	You guys are more excited when he left than when he came.
4971680	4972680	I know.
4972680	4973680	It's funny.
4973680	4977680	I hate to see him leave, but I love to watch him walk away.
4977680	4981680	Poor Rob. He's great. He's great. We love him.
4981680	4983680	I'm just trying to have his back.
4983680	4984680	All right.
4984680	4986680	Anyway, I was...
4986680	4988680	You were going to do Nina Cherry.
4988680	4991680	I think I did do Nina Cherry, and it was exhausting.
4991680	4993680	It's like six minutes, so I'm up there just fucking...
4993680	4994680	Buffalo Stance.
4994680	4996680	Buffalo Stance, we'll take it out of you, man.
4996680	4998680	She's got a lot of...
4998680	5000680	She does a lot of rapping, but then she's got that hook.
5000680	5001680	What's the hook?
5001680	5003680	Don't be like, what is she like?
5003680	5005680	The hook is, who's looking good today?
5005680	5007680	Looking good in every way.
5007680	5009680	Don't mess with me.
5009680	5010680	That's a fun one.
5010680	5013680	And I'm not a girl, so I'm singing it like a girl, so it's fun.
5013680	5015680	I'm having fun. I'm trying to be fun.
5015680	5017680	Anyway, so I did my song...
5017680	5018680	Hashtag singing like a girl.
5018680	5019680	Yeah, I'm singing like a girl.
5019680	5022680	Anyway, I did my song, it's fine, whatever.
5022680	5024680	I can't remember who came after me.
5024680	5025680	I think you did it to great acclaim.
5025680	5027680	I think the crowd was quite pleased.
5027680	5028680	Okay, all right.
5028680	5031680	I heard you talking on the video, and you were going,
5031680	5033680	oh, look at all of it go.
5033680	5035680	Oh, yeah, well, I was on board.
5035680	5036680	All right.
5036680	5037680	I'm a big fan.
5037680	5038680	So I had a fun time.
5038680	5039680	You did it?
5039680	5041680	I came off stage having a great time.
5041680	5042680	The night is going great.
5042680	5044680	And then I think I saw Jeff.
5044680	5045680	Like, they called your name, right?
5045680	5046680	No.
5046680	5047680	They never called your name?
5047680	5048680	No.
5048680	5050680	You're getting the story wrong.
5050680	5051680	Callie Kazoo, get up here.
5051680	5053680	Callie Fonteccio coming to stage.
5053680	5054680	She was there.
5054680	5055680	Let's have some.
5055680	5056680	I mean, like, I was super drunk.
5056680	5057680	She's the Bernstein.
5057680	5058680	Do his one word.
5058680	5059680	Let's fucking get this right.
5059680	5060680	Let's back up.
5060680	5061680	Okay, first thing that Jeff did...
5061680	5062680	Did you already say, first of all,
5062680	5063680	Callie sang the...
5063680	5064680	Callie's new album is out,
5064680	5065680	and her song was the one that was playing in the beginning.
5065680	5066680	Thank you.
5066680	5067680	I've been playing her song all night long.
5067680	5069680	What's the new record called?
5069680	5070680	Contrary to Popular Belief,
5070680	5072680	and that song was called Hey Look,
5072680	5073680	and you can check out the music video online,
5073680	5075680	which has Willie Roberts in it,
5075680	5076680	and Demorj Brown.
5076680	5077680	And I was cut out.
5077680	5078680	And Kate Croin.
5078680	5079680	I was also cut out.
5079680	5080680	All that was cut out, but...
5080680	5081680	Yeah, I was in the video, but I was cut out.
5081680	5082680	Thank you.
5082680	5083680	It's fine.
5083680	5084680	My parents...
5084680	5085680	Now work for my interest.
5085680	5086680	Yeah.
5086680	5088680	No, I mean, it's good that I was cut out,
5088680	5091680	because it'd be another thing to explain to my parents.
5091680	5093680	Oh, everyone was dressed as a woman.
5093680	5094680	Yeah, because I was dressed like a woman.
5094680	5095680	All right, enough.
5095680	5096680	It's been plugged.
5096680	5097680	Enough.
5097680	5098680	It's been plugged, yeah.
5098680	5100680	There's only a few people in this room.
5100680	5102680	You do live karaoke.
5102680	5103680	It's similar to this.
5103680	5106680	You're on a stage or whatever.
5106680	5107680	Jeff walked in.
5107680	5108680	It's not like a private room.
5108680	5109680	I just wanted to clarify that.
5109680	5110680	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5110680	5112680	It's a big, big room, you know.
5112680	5113680	A bar.
5113680	5115680	Yeah, a bar room and a hotel.
5115680	5117680	First thing Jeff does is he goes
5117680	5119680	and he puts money in the tip jar.
5119680	5120680	He puts $5.
5120680	5121680	Well, there's a stipulation.
5121680	5123680	Some people said he put more than $5.
5123680	5124680	He put?
5124680	5125680	Did I talk to people about the story?
5125680	5126680	Okay, can I just say?
5126680	5128680	Who said he put more than $5?
5128680	5129680	Why so?
5129680	5130680	Why so said he put more?
5130680	5132680	I can settle that part of it right off the bat.
5132680	5134680	When we got there, there was only about maybe
5134680	5136680	10, 15 people there total.
5136680	5138680	Then a little later there was maybe 30 people.
5138680	5139680	It started to fill up.
5139680	5141680	I signed up fairly early on.
5141680	5143680	And when I signed up, I wrote down a song,
5143680	5145680	gave it to, there's a guy in a gala there.
5145680	5147680	I gave them a $5 bill.
5147680	5149680	I put a $5 bill in their little jug.
5149680	5152680	And that was the only money in that jug.
5152680	5153680	He was the first tipper.
5153680	5154680	It was early in the night.
5154680	5156680	So then I sat down, and then time passes.
5156680	5159680	And then Abed goes on, and I go on,
5159680	5162680	and we put in our slips of paper at the same time as Jeff.
5162680	5164680	And then tons of people were going on.
5164680	5166680	And Jeff's like, well, what's going on?
5166680	5167680	How come I'm not getting called?
5167680	5170680	So he walks over, and he has a little discussion.
5170680	5172680	Me and Abed don't understand what's going on.
5172680	5175680	He goes onto the stage and says, worst karaoke place ever.
5175680	5177680	We're like, oh, taking a joke?
5177680	5179680	There was a conversation that happened in between that.
5179680	5182680	But we didn't find that out until he came over to us.
5182680	5183680	I was like, is he joking?
5183680	5185680	And then we realized as he walked over, I was like, oh,
5185680	5186680	Jeff's mad.
5186680	5187680	I walked over into it.
5187680	5189680	Like, it's a place where there's regulars there.
5189680	5191680	They're going to get preferential treatment.
5191680	5192680	I understand that.
5192680	5193680	I'm all for that.
5193680	5194680	Because I go to other karaoke places
5194680	5198680	where I am the beneficiary of that preferential treatment.
5198680	5199680	Right, right.
5199680	5200680	So I dig that.
5200680	5202680	So somebody comes in after I signed up,
5202680	5203680	and they get up first.
5203680	5204680	Hooray.
5204680	5206680	But now I think some people sang twice in front of me.
5206680	5208680	And also, there's people that came in way after me.
5208680	5210680	I think you're paying too much attention to who's singing when.
5210680	5212680	Because I'm really drunk, and I'm just like,
5212680	5213680	you can't call my name.
5213680	5214680	I go up.
5214680	5215680	So I walked over.
5215680	5216680	I walked over.
5216680	5221680	And I have to say, I was in all good faith and all good climate
5221680	5225680	walked over there and said, I was excited to see you go up.
5225680	5227680	I said, I just want to check how far away am I?
5227680	5228680	And she showed me the list.
5228680	5231680	And I was nowhere fucking anywhere on it.
5231680	5232680	I go, what?
5232680	5233680	And she goes, did you sign up?
5233680	5234680	I'm like, yeah.
5234680	5235680	I signed up like a while back.
5235680	5238680	And the guy's like, yeah, I don't think you did.
5238680	5239680	And so they showed me.
5239680	5241680	Then he puts my name down at the bottom list.
5241680	5245680	I'm like, no, I was here when there was nobody here.
5245680	5248680	And they're like, yeah, you're on the list now.
5248680	5250680	I said, do you see the $5?
5250680	5252680	Do you remember that conversation that happened?
5252680	5255680	Where I walked up when there was nobody in here.
5255680	5256680	And I signed up and handed you.
5256680	5258680	We all spoke to each other.
5258680	5259680	And I gave you a $5 bill.
5259680	5262680	And it went into this tip jar.
5262680	5265680	And they're like, well, yeah, I don't remember.
5265680	5266680	You're on it now.
5266680	5269680	And so I was like, yeah, but now you're just lying to me.
5269680	5272680	And the woman takes the $5 bill and hands it back here.
5272680	5273680	Whoa.
5273680	5274680	I can see that.
5274680	5275680	I didn't see that.
5275680	5278680	I took it and went rip, rip, rip and threw it in her face.
5278680	5279680	Oh my god.
5279680	5280680	Here's your $5 bill.
5280680	5282680	And she took the shreds and she snorted them.
5282680	5284680	And then she was like, shit them out.
5284680	5285680	Just being fucking shit.
5285680	5286680	I didn't see that.
5286680	5287680	I'm fucking late.
5287680	5288680	You told me about it.
5288680	5290680	I was just being lied to.
5290680	5291680	Just being lied to.
5291680	5293680	They go, well, you're up next.
5293680	5295680	They said, you're not going on.
5295680	5296680	I took the mic.
5296680	5299680	Everybody, a shitty as karaoke plays in the universe.
5299680	5300680	I walked up there.
5300680	5301680	We thought it was a joke.
5301680	5302680	We're like, what's happening?
5302680	5303680	No.
5303680	5305680	I thought he was, you said he was, you thought he was making fun of the guy
5305680	5306680	before him.
5306680	5309680	No, I was making fun of the two assholes running karaoke.
5309680	5310680	So then.
5310680	5311680	There was a fake ass.
5311680	5313680	Some poor guy just finished doing Elvis.
5313680	5317680	And it's like, he's like, he's, his therapist convinced him to go out.
5317680	5322680	And risk judgment in a safe way.
5322680	5325680	Wise men say.
5325680	5329680	It's like the stand up guy pulling in love with you.
5329680	5330680	And then Jeff comes up.
5330680	5333680	Worst karaoke place ever.
5333680	5334680	He just stand up.
5334680	5338680	He trushes a bag of potatoes and pours them all over his face.
5338680	5340680	I did this to an empty stage.
5340680	5341680	It was to an empty stage.
5341680	5343680	Then I got my shit together.
5343680	5344680	Told a couple of people that were there.
5344680	5348680	So I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to be here anymore.
5348680	5351680	What I didn't find out is that you were in the hallway with like a security
5351680	5354680	guard in the lady for a long time.
5354680	5355680	That was scary.
5355680	5360680	I went right out and called the lift to bone the fuck out.
5360680	5364680	And I got out in the hallway like leaving the bar, like leaving the hotel.
5364680	5368680	And a guy with the ear monitor and the suit.
5368680	5369680	Burbank, California.
5369680	5371680	Comes up to me and he goes.
5371680	5374680	With a woman, I think who's also probably like, you know, like some sort of manager
5374680	5375680	at the hotel.
5375680	5376680	And like, sir, you have to go.
5376680	5378680	I'm like, oh no, I believe me, I'm leaving.
5378680	5379680	I'm calling my car right now.
5379680	5380680	Like I'm not wanting to hear it.
5380680	5381680	I saw you.
5381680	5383680	I saw like a long conversation and then I asked Kelly.
5383680	5384680	They were like, should I go over there?
5384680	5385680	And like, you have to go.
5385680	5387680	I'm like, like, I wouldn't stay here on a bet.
5387680	5389680	Like I'm going.
5389680	5393680	I said, and I said, and believe me, it's I'm sorry if any, if this ever involves
5393680	5396680	you, I'm like, I'm not going to cause any trouble.
5396680	5398680	Like I'm, I'm simply leaving.
5398680	5399680	Like I'm just calling a car.
5399680	5402680	We can walk outside to where the car is coming.
5402680	5404680	And that was the end of the story.
5404680	5408680	However, I've never ripped up currency and thrown it in somebody's face.
5408680	5409680	That was shocking.
5409680	5410680	That is amazing.
5410680	5411680	That shocked me.
5411680	5412680	I've never seen Jeff.
5412680	5417680	So like, they lied to me when you came back to me and you were just like, fuck this place.
5417680	5420680	There was five dollars in that fucking jar.
5420680	5422680	I pretended like we had never met.
5422680	5425680	Like telling everyone to fuck off.
5425680	5427680	I was like, I did it.
5427680	5433680	I don't presume that five dollars in the plastic Costco pretzel jar that you took
5433680	5435680	the label off and like scrubbed it down.
5435680	5437680	So it didn't look like there was a pretzel label on there.
5437680	5439680	That is your shitty chip jar.
5439680	5445680	I don't presume that five dollars in that jar entitles me to shit.
5445680	5451680	But just don't fucking pretend that we never spoke because it was, it was within the hour
5451680	5453680	and we were fucking there.
5453680	5457680	You know what's funny is every time I've gone, I'm like, oh, here's your money.
5457680	5459680	I'm like, here's your fucking money, lady.
5459680	5462680	Also, Jeff is the only six foot guy in a suit.
5462680	5463680	Right, right, right.
5463680	5466680	Well, now everyone else was just like Bono.
5466680	5468680	I'm not saying I'm here.
5468680	5470680	I was ashamed of myself.
5470680	5472680	I still did not feel good about that.
5472680	5474680	I'm not saying I'm a good guy.
5474680	5477680	What I did do is fuck off into Koreatown.
5477680	5481680	Went to a karaoke place where it was fucking a groovy Tuesday, man.
5481680	5482680	It was really good.
5482680	5483680	Oh, I'm sure.
5483680	5484680	I'm sure.
5484680	5485680	I wanted to go with you.
5485680	5486680	We should have all gone there.
5486680	5488680	Five fucking minutes after you left.
5488680	5491680	Jeff D is Jeff D there.
5491680	5492680	Jeff D.
5492680	5493680	They didn't even know.
5493680	5494680	I wasn't on that list.
5494680	5495680	I saw the list.
5495680	5498680	They showed it to me, and they gave me the fucking short shrift.
5498680	5500680	It was an accident, is what I'm thinking.
5500680	5501680	There's no accident.
5501680	5505680	I just want to point out that if Jeff had done that on Twitter,
5505680	5509680	it would be called a meltdown.
5509680	5510680	That's called a meltdown.
5510680	5513680	I honestly, he melted down.
5513680	5515680	I never tipped until that night.
5515680	5519680	No, Dan, you would have taken $1,005 bills
5519680	5520680	and torn it up to everybody.
5520680	5521680	No, I would have fucked it.
5521680	5524680	I mean, believe me, I'm not.
5525680	5528680	A lot of fascinating things are happening.
5528680	5530680	I brought Abed up here to exploit him.
5530680	5532680	I thought he was going to be the guy in the jar.
5532680	5535680	You are definitely the...
5535680	5537680	I'm not saying I'm not on your side.
5537680	5538680	No, I'm fucking Batman.
5538680	5539680	But you are wrong.
5539680	5542680	This is worth talking about.
5542680	5543680	This was worth talking about.
5543680	5544680	That's why I texted you.
5544680	5547680	I feel like you should know this.
5547680	5549680	Gwen, get up here.
5549680	5550680	Gwen, baby.
5550680	5551680	Gwen from...
5551680	5552680	Where are you from?
5552680	5553680	Delaware?
5554680	5555680	Iowa.
5555680	5557680	Gwen was there.
5557680	5559680	I have an interesting story about...
5559680	5560680	Gwen, get up here.
5560680	5561680	I got an interesting story.
5561680	5562680	This is Gwen Beatty, everybody.
5562680	5564680	About you guys.
5564680	5566680	Hey, Jeff, real quick.
5566680	5568680	That applause is very apprehensive.
5568680	5570680	Everyone's like, what the fuck is happening?
5570680	5572680	I was buying a drink.
5572680	5574680	I was at the bar buying a drink,
5574680	5576680	and you were there with your two friends.
5576680	5579680	I didn't know them, but they were talking about you.
5579680	5581680	And I was eavesdropping,
5581680	5582680	because they didn't know that I knew you.
5582680	5583680	And they were saying, like,
5583680	5586680	who wears a suit to a bar like this?
5586680	5588680	And I thought that was funny,
5588680	5589680	but now what's going on?
5589680	5591680	People want to know if Gwen's the bouncer
5591680	5593680	at the karaoke bar, if they need to know.
5593680	5594680	Gwen is from Iowa.
5594680	5595680	I met her.
5595680	5596680	You're traveling.
5596680	5597680	I met her at the drawing room,
5597680	5599680	and that day, I said,
5599680	5601680	my friend Abed, real Abed from community.
5601680	5603680	She's like, oh, shit, I know community.
5603680	5605680	Real Abed from community.
5605680	5607680	Yeah, well, Jeff was building me up, yeah.
5607680	5609680	I was saying, we're talking about karaoke.
5609680	5611680	I said, I'm going to do karaoke with my friend Abed,
5611680	5615680	who is famously the inspiration for Abed from community.
5615680	5617680	But Gwen, you texted me today and said,
5617680	5620680	you have been kicked out of three places in two nights?
5620680	5621680	Yeah.
5621680	5623680	I've never been kicked out of a place,
5623680	5625680	and I came to L.A. for one day,
5625680	5627680	and I've been kicked out of three.
5627680	5630680	Including a holiday in Burbank, California.
5630680	5632680	Yeah, but yours was my favorite, for sure.
5632680	5633680	Yeah.
5633680	5636680	Because I destroyed Lincoln's effigy.
5636680	5637680	What a birthday.
5637680	5638680	What a birthday.
5638680	5639680	Good job.
5639680	5641680	I am sad, though, because it is a cool karaoke place.
5641680	5644680	There's some weirdos there, and you got the worst end of it.
5644680	5647680	I didn't like the sound set up.
5647680	5652680	You should say, before all the Jeff crazy shit happened,
5652680	5655680	my friend Ben Page, you know Ben Page.
5655680	5656680	I know Ben Page.
5656680	5659680	Yeah, he's a karaoke genius, and he went up,
5659680	5662680	and he did Pink Floyd the Wall, like one of the songs.
5662680	5664680	And then they had some sort of,
5664680	5666680	the version of it was shitty,
5666680	5668680	and in the middle of the song, he just walked off the stage.
5668680	5669680	Shit.
5669680	5671680	Yeah, and he's like, that version sucks.
5671680	5672680	It was an off night.
5672680	5675680	Yeah, and I'm like, you can't just walk off the stage
5675680	5676680	in the middle of the song, dude.
5676680	5677680	Like, I felt bad.
5677680	5678680	I was like...
5678680	5680680	Sounds like I'm kind of a hero for not going to your birthday.
5680680	5681680	I think so.
5681680	5682680	It's quite a scene.
5682680	5684680	Yeah, Dan, you're off the hook, man.
5684680	5685680	You're off the hook.
5685680	5688680	Try staying there and doing karaoke after that happens.
5688680	5689680	It's impossible.
5689680	5691680	It's like, nobody's having fun.
5691680	5694680	All right, Abed, what other ideas do you have
5694680	5697680	that you could try to explain?
5697680	5698680	What?
5698680	5699680	Ideas?
5699680	5701680	I didn't know I didn't have ideas coming out here.
5701680	5702680	Do you have any...
5702680	5705680	You're famous for having pitched a restaurant idea where...
5705680	5706680	Oh, yeah, yeah.
5706680	5707680	Oh, he wants more ideas.
5707680	5710680	Do you have any inventions or shit you want to lay on this?
5710680	5711680	It's just a hope.
5711680	5712680	It's just a hope.
5712680	5713680	He's hoping for something.
5713680	5714680	Yeah, yeah.
5714680	5715680	Don't make up on the thing you don't have.
5715680	5716680	Wait, wait, wait.
5716680	5717680	Talk about my spec I'm writing.
5717680	5718680	No, will you talk...
5718680	5719680	Because that's kind of an idea.
5719680	5722680	Will you talk about the cop that hit on you?
5722680	5723680	Oh, the cop.
5723680	5724680	But that's...
5724680	5726680	I'm saving that for GVP, though.
5726680	5727680	Should I...
5727680	5728680	First of all...
5728680	5729680	You can do both.
5729680	5730680	First of all...
5730680	5731680	All right, all right.
5731680	5732680	Is there a GVP now?
5732680	5734680	I was saving that for their episode.
5734680	5735680	All right, I'll do it.
5735680	5736680	I'll talk about it.
5736680	5739680	When Grandma's virginity starts churning out once a week,
5739680	5740680	they can have exclusives.
5740680	5741680	Justin and Ryan Ridley.
5741680	5742680	Can I get a hint of that?
5742680	5743680	What is that?
5743680	5744680	Is that...
5744680	5745680	That's medication.
5745680	5748680	I have a prescription in that.
5748680	5751680	I pulled it out and it was...
5751680	5752680	I had to ask her.
5752680	5753680	I don't want to cause chaos.
5753680	5754680	I see.
5754680	5755680	Let's all...
5755680	5757680	Let's all ground ourselves.
5757680	5758680	Wait, you want the cop story?
5758680	5759680	The lady cop story?
5759680	5760680	I'd like it.
5760680	5762680	And also, I want to play a super fight
5762680	5763680	like you guys played in Chicago, too.
5763680	5764680	Can we do that tonight or not?
5764680	5767680	I want to hear about getting kicked out of three places
5767680	5768680	in one...
5768680	5769680	Okay, all right.
5769680	5770680	Let's hear all that.
5770680	5771680	Gwen, what were the other two joints
5771680	5772680	that you got bounced out of?
5772680	5774680	Wait, how did you get kicked out of the karaoke places?
5774680	5778680	I kicked myself out of Holiday Inn Burbank.
5778680	5779680	She was there for that one.
5779680	5780680	He left.
5780680	5781680	He was like...
5781680	5782680	He was done at Super Fight.
5782680	5783680	Well, let's pick...
5783680	5784680	Just so everybody understands,
5784680	5787680	let's create a Starship Troopers graphic package.
5787680	5789680	Would you like to know more?
5789680	5792680	Okay, we're going with Gwen getting kicked out of three places.
5792680	5793680	Let's go there.
5793680	5796680	So let's all go there together, eyes wide open.
5796680	5798680	Starship Troopers?
5798680	5799680	I don't remember that part.
5799680	5800680	All right, put a pin in it.
5800680	5803680	I'm going to have to look that up later.
5803680	5808680	Okay, because Gwen, three places in how many days?
5808680	5810680	It was like two.
5810680	5811680	Okay.
5811680	5812680	No, one of them...
5812680	5815680	Bottomless mimosas aren't bottomless, first of all.
5815680	5818680	Shots fired.
5818680	5819680	That's true.
5819680	5821680	She's saying what we're all thinking.
5821680	5825680	And the other place that we got kicked out of was because of the bottomless mimosas.
5825680	5828680	You found out that you drank too many mimosas and like,
5828680	5831680	okay, bottomless is a subjective term.
5831680	5834680	They came out and said, this has to eventually end.
5834680	5837680	They said, wow, that's amazing.
5837680	5840680	That's like you're in World War II and Nazis come out
5840680	5842680	and they go like, look, we get it.
5842680	5844680	You love freedom.
5844680	5846680	That was a terrible example.
5846680	5848680	You couldn't find the bottom.
5848680	5850680	I feel like the glass was really low.
5850680	5851680	Gwen, okay, but just take us through.
5851680	5854680	So as a person who got kicked out of three places in two days,
5854680	5856680	take us first one, second one, third one.
5856680	5857680	Number one.
5857680	5858680	Right, okay.
5858680	5862680	Remember me tearing up money at the Holiday Inn.
5862680	5863680	But I understand.
5863680	5864680	How did you get kicked out?
5864680	5865680	Yeah, exactly.
5865680	5867680	When I did that, I knew...
5867680	5868680	No, we know you.
5868680	5869680	Why her?
5869680	5870680	She was with me.
5870680	5871680	She was his boss.
5871680	5872680	Well, we don't know that.
5872680	5873680	We're fascinated by that.
5873680	5874680	Jeff had a date.
5874680	5875680	No, no, no, no, no.
5875680	5877680	There was her and her two friends.
5877680	5878680	It was like a whole group.
5878680	5880680	Jeff had a platonic date.
5880680	5882680	Wait, so you guys...
5882680	5885680	I brought a woman from Iowa with her friends up to the bar.
5885680	5887680	But they already knew that you were going to be there?
5887680	5889680	They talked at the bar like they didn't know you.
5889680	5891680	I met Gwen that day at the drawing.
5891680	5892680	I bet you didn't know this was going to happen.
5892680	5894680	You were talking about it in front of all these people.
5894680	5895680	I eavesdropped.
5895680	5897680	It sounded like they didn't know who you were
5897680	5898680	and they were making fun of yourself.
5898680	5900680	Does anybody truly know who I am?
5900680	5903680	Yeah, well, I'd like to know you.
5903680	5906680	Do you think if they knew who he was, he'd get better treatment?
5906680	5907680	Is that what you're saying?
5907680	5908680	No, I don't know.
5908680	5909680	I don't think they cares it.
5909680	5910680	All right, all right, all right.
5910680	5912680	Gwen, second place you got kicked out of.
5912680	5913680	The place with the mimosas.
5913680	5915680	I don't know what the fuck that was.
5915680	5919680	You drank them out of champagne and orange juice.
5919680	5920680	All right.
5920680	5921680	Okay.
5921680	5922680	And then the other place,
5922680	5925680	we walked down the street like two bars down
5925680	5930680	and then Logan fell asleep on the bar and we had to go.
5930680	5931680	Fell asleep on the bar.
5931680	5932680	Yeah.
5932680	5933680	Logan, you son of a ...
5933680	5934680	For like 45 minutes.
5934680	5935680	What bar?
5935680	5936680	Was that the guy that was with you guys?
5936680	5938680	Not a very good bar.
5938680	5939680	That was the guy that was with you guys, right?
5939680	5941680	No, Logan's the girl, but ...
5941680	5942680	Oh, Logan's the girl.
5942680	5943680	Okay.
5943680	5944680	Logan.
5944680	5946680	I thought that was a man's name.
5946680	5947680	But, you know ...
5947680	5948680	Wolverine.
5948680	5949680	I mean, I'm sorry.
5949680	5950680	No.
5950680	5951680	No, I mean, my Wolverine brain went to ...
5951680	5954680	I pictured a dude at first, too, Logan.
5954680	5955680	Logan's the girl.
5955680	5956680	Logan's the girl.
5956680	5957680	All right.
5957680	5960680	So you were asked to leave or gently left places that you probably shouldn't have stayed
5960680	5961680	in?
5961680	5962680	It was go, both times.
5962680	5966280	And it was someone who really didn't ... Both times it was someone ... I felt bad for them
5966280	5967280	having to ...
5967280	5968280	Gwen ... Okay.
5968280	5969280	Now, I'm remembering.
5969280	5970280	Gwen has an awesome story.
5970280	5974240	Can we talk about your origin story of you and Iowa?
5974240	5981960	She's famous in this very small part of Iowa for being like ... She's in the movie Footloose.
5982960	5983960	She's like all the Kevin Bacon's in the world.
5983960	5986960	Wait, the remake or the old classic?
5986960	5988960	Can we talk about this, or is this bad?
5988960	5989960	Yeah.
5989960	5990960	Are we adding flame to the fire?
5990960	5991960	Yeah, it's fine.
5991960	5992960	No, it's totally okay.
5992960	5993960	The classic ...
5993960	5994960	I don't think anyone in Iowa knows that this exists.
5994960	5995960	It's okay.
5995960	5996960	All right.
5996960	5997960	Do you want to tell it?
5997960	5998960	You can start.
5998960	5999960	I don't know where to start.
5999960	6000960	Well, I met her.
6000960	6001960	She grew up ... Correct me if I'm wrong.
6001960	6004960	You grew up in a very ... Not evangelical, but ...
6004960	6005960	It's like fundamentalist Christian.
6005960	6010960	Fundamentalist Christian type where you get to where a head covering, dancing was prescribed
6010960	6011960	like illegal, right?
6011960	6012960	Yeah.
6012960	6013960	I had to wear a head covering.
6013960	6015840	Well, you can start doing square dancing.
6015840	6016840	That's fine.
6016840	6017840	Because you're not touching.
6017840	6024840	But at her school, her mother was the vice president or principal of the college, and
6024840	6028560	a very fundamentalist Christian school where there's lots of rules.
6028560	6030760	You're not allowed to be in a car alone with a boy.
6030760	6031760	That's grounds for expulsion.
6031760	6033840	Yeah, that's like my dad always said that.
6033840	6034840	All right.
6034840	6035840	So ...
6035840	6040520	He was like, no girl, you and just a girl, you know, like none of that.
6040560	6042520	Well, your dad was just protecting the community.
6042520	6044520	He was ...
6044520	6046520	Ouch, ouch.
6046520	6047520	I'm not a ...
6047520	6049520	Just due diligence.
6049520	6050520	You win, you win.
6050520	6051520	You win this round.
6051520	6052520	How old were you?
6052520	6057520	What was the first transgression?
6057520	6059520	The first time you got rumbled at school?
6059520	6062520	Oh, I blew a dude, and he told on me.
6062520	6064520	Oh, I hate when that happens.
6064520	6065520	I wouldn't tell.
6065520	6067520	He calls us though he had sinned.
6067520	6069520	I'm like, what's this?
6069520	6076520	In his defense, at that age, if you get blown, I mean, and you don't tell anybody, did it even happen?
6077520	6079520	He probably didn't even mean to get you in trouble.
6079520	6083520	He was just like, oh my God, that felt so good now, God damn it.
6083520	6085520	I'm showing everybody.
6085520	6086520	Mailman.
6086520	6092520	But he told to like expiate his own sins, but also that sent you up the river.
6092520	6093520	Yes.
6093520	6094520	Oh God, that's awful.
6094520	6096520	And then the second one was what?
6096520	6103520	I drove some kids to a party, and I like had a hit from a joint, and then I got told on.
6103520	6104520	All right, so you got told on twice.
6104520	6105520	Kicked out of the school.
6105520	6107520	She was like Bill Clinton, you know.
6107520	6108520	Took a hit.
6108520	6109520	Got trouble.
6109520	6111520	She was also her own Monica Lewinsky.
6111520	6112520	Yeah.
6112520	6113520	Yeah.
6113520	6114520	She had both.
6114520	6116520	She's like Bill Clinton.
6116520	6118520	It's the female Bill Clinton.
6118520	6119520	Wow.
6119520	6123520	So both times you got told on by male students, right?
6123520	6124520	Yeah.
6124520	6126520	They probably didn't suffer any consequences because that's.
6126520	6127520	Probably less.
6127520	6128520	Male privilege, right?
6128520	6130520	I remember the word harlot being thrown around.
6130520	6133520	So you're the Hester Prynne of this town.
6133520	6135520	Wait, wait, was it for the blow job or the weed?
6135520	6136520	Both.
6136520	6137520	Okay.
6137520	6138520	That makes you a harlot.
6138520	6139520	You can't just do one.
6139520	6142520	Because she's a female Abed.
6142520	6145520	No, I mean, I didn't even think of in that zone.
6145520	6146520	All right, you're right.
6146520	6147520	You're right.
6147520	6148520	Fair enough.
6148520	6149520	Fair enough.
6149520	6152520	I'm going to step aside here.
6152520	6155520	Before I get you take it down 20 percent.
6155520	6156520	She goes up 20 percent.
6156520	6157520	That's like we're doing a symphony.
6157520	6158520	It's all math.
6158520	6159520	Yeah, you're right.
6159520	6160520	You're right.
6160520	6161520	All right.
6161520	6162520	Continue.
6162520	6165520	So now there's a scandal involving your mother who is the top brass at the.
6165520	6166520	No, not really.
6166520	6167520	Just me.
6167520	6168520	It just.
6168520	6169520	But it didn't.
6169520	6172520	It didn't affect her like standing in the community or.
6172520	6174520	No, no, no.
6174520	6175520	But you still live in the community.
6175520	6176520	Yeah.
6176520	6179520	And now when people find you, if people run into you, they either think, oh, I didn't
6179520	6181520	know that you're like Paul Bunyan.
6181520	6182520	Like you're an actual folklore.
6182520	6183520	There's two.
6183520	6187520	There's I think there's all of those rules at the school now because of me.
6187520	6193020	But there's also there's also I work at a bar and people will come in and it will be
6193020	6195520	one of two not to drink because it's coffee shop during the day.
6195520	6196520	It doesn't matter.
6196520	6200520	But they go to the school and they'll come in and I either get.
6200520	6206520	Oh, there's another one and they think I'm my sister or are you twins?
6206520	6208520	No, she's three years older than me.
6208520	6214520	Or it's oh, oh, I didn't I didn't I didn't know that was real.
6214520	6215520	Like that's.
6215520	6216520	Yeah.
6216520	6218520	So it's kind of folklore.
6218520	6220520	I'm like, yeah.
6220520	6223520	Meaning that they didn't know it was real that you got punished.
6223520	6229520	That existed or that this is a folkloric tale to scare people off of getting blown in a car.
6229520	6230520	Sorry.
6230520	6231520	Sorry.
6231520	6232520	Sorry.
6232520	6233520	Sorry.
6233520	6234520	Sorry.
6234520	6240520	It was real that your that your crimes existed or that it was that it was wrong to do the
6240520	6241520	things that you did.
6241520	6244520	You don't know what I'm asking for the actual person that actually exists.
6244520	6246520	OK, but that doesn't clarify.
6246520	6252520	Is the community is the community still steeped in such medieval hypocrisy?
6252520	6254520	Like this is like five years ago.
6254520	6255520	OK.
6255520	6256520	So I wasn't clear.
6256520	6257520	I was over there.
6257520	6259520	You and they go, oh, I didn't know you really existed.
6259520	6260520	I didn't know that really happened.
6260520	6261520	I didn't know.
6261520	6263520	I wanted to be clear that they weren't saying.
6263520	6267520	Oh, I didn't know it was real that we actually stoned a person.
6267520	6269520	Johnny clarification over here.
6269520	6270520	Yes.
6270520	6271520	Yeah.
6271520	6272520	And that's a bottle.
6272520	6274520	I'm really good.
6274520	6275520	Right.
6275520	6276520	I kind of want to talk.
6276520	6282520	Like I have a sense of the idea of like I feel like I've heard versions of that.
6282520	6285520	Just like that little bazooka Joe comic like that.
6285520	6286520	It's not even a story.
6286520	6292520	It's just like a little sliver of like like it's adolescent like encounters with misogyny.
6292520	6301520	That phrase I blew a dude and he told on me like that in one form or another that happens constantly that that's like the first encounter.
6301520	6304520	And it's like the thing that always fascinates me is like I don't know.
6304520	6321520	Women don't have like a like like it's like it's like if you're if you're like selfless enough to like like you're like with a guy and you're like like I really want this person to you're like like like how does that.
6322520	6324520	Well it's either you want his dick or you don't.
6324520	6325520	Stop it.
6325520	6326520	I'm sorry.
6326520	6327520	I'm sorry.
6327520	6328520	I'm sorry.
6328520	6329520	I'm hurting myself enough.
6329520	6330520	I don't.
6330520	6331520	I got to.
6331520	6332520	I got to.
6332520	6333520	Kind of.
6333520	6334520	With that.
6334520	6335520	Yeah.
6335520	6336520	Yeah.
6336520	6346520	It's not like it's like women have a ton of like young girl from their adolescence in small towns where they do get Hester Prince like like there's not there's not a ton of stories where girls go.
6346520	6353520	I was so horny that I jumped on a dude and made myself come on his dick and then they told on me.
6353520	6362520	It's like they go I blew a dude like like I'm not saying women don't get pleasure out of giving us like everybody is having fun when everyone's having fun.
6362520	6367520	But isn't that I mean I was excommunicated from testing for eating too much pussy.
6367520	6369520	That see that doesn't happen.
6369520	6373520	It's like I ate a girl's pussy and she told me.
6373520	6380520	First of all she never tells fucking betrayed me like sucking a dick is like a power trip right.
6380520	6383520	It's kind of like it's like a domination thing.
6383520	6387520	I think you know I think it's called a blowjob because it's a job.
6387520	6392520	You have to like really try to suck that dick make it feel good.
6392520	6394520	A lot of girls don't like that.
6394520	6403520	You're swirling around my point but I am but also surrounding my point is why it's called a blowjob.
6403520	6406520	Let me talk like a six year old for a second and just bound through this minefield.
6406520	6409520	I'm not going to try to be politically correct or win any points.
6409520	6417520	When I hear that stuff I just go but a woman sucking your dick is the biggest favor she could ever do in your life.
6417520	6423520	And the idea that that also makes you a slut instead of a saint is insane.
6424520	6427520	That a young guy.
6427520	6431520	It's not like she's indulging her impulses.
6431520	6440520	She's indulging a natural like oh that's such a highly evolved person that at that age she wanted to give something to someone.
6440520	6445520	In a community that repressed that the guy can go oh I feel really guilty about this.
6445520	6450520	I'm going to turn us both in and she's the one that gets in trouble not me.
6451520	6468520	Honestly as a dude and having been that age like I said as a joke but it's like still it was like I think the original the foundation of it is if you're a dude and you find out that it's possible for a girl to like you enough to give of herself to you.
6468520	6476520	You can't you start to get obsessed and you go like but what if no one ever knows this happened and I got hit by a bus.
6476520	6489520	And when that thought hits you unfortunately you're in a locker room in the middle of Poughkeep Poughkeepsier whatever Gwen Gwen Gwen do you think there was any braggadocio or do you think it was just guilt and him trying to because you're religious or he was religious.
6489520	6492520	There's no difference between guilt and braggadocio by the way.
6492520	6493520	That's the same thing.
6493520	6499520	God bless me father for I have sinned I fucking like a chick fucking thought it was hot like oh I'm just dying about it.
6499520	6507520	Well it's a little different because like she said like she said fundamentalist like it's pretty hardcore religious it's like you know he actually felt bad.
6507520	6509520	Yeah growing up Muslim we never got there.
6509520	6514520	I mean when you're bragging about someone blowing you you don't usually tell like the president of your college.
6514520	6519520	You said he was also kind of like a huckster car salesman he kind of.
6519520	6520520	Yeah.
6520520	6521520	Yeah.
6521520	6522520	So he was full of shit.
6522520	6523520	It's like level two in religion.
6523520	6529520	It's like the joke where an old guy goes in a confessional and the priest opens the door and it's a very old man and the priest says how can I help you.
6529520	6534520	And he says I've been happily married for 50 years never cheated on my wife once until last night.
6534520	6542520	And I had just filthy crazy sex with an 18 year old cheerleader every position all night long just wild crazy sex.
6542520	6544520	And the priest says oh my God that's really serious.
6544520	6547520	He should do 100 Hail Marys and 200 Our Fathers.
6547520	6549520	And the guy says I'm not Catholic I'm Jewish.
6549520	6550520	And the priest says why are you telling me.
6550520	6551520	Is it telling you.
6551520	6553520	I'm telling everybody.
6553520	6558520	And that is that is actually that's what I believe is the root of that.
6558520	6565520	That's that's the root of the earliest encounter with misogyny that like like that.
6565520	6571520	That women have is like it's like little boys going like I can't believe it's possible.
6571520	6575520	I have to tell somebody or I feel so terrible it happened.
6575520	6578520	I don't think blow jobs feel good.
6578520	6579520	Whoa.
6579520	6580520	The only one.
6580520	6581520	All right.
6581520	6582520	I've not had a good job.
6582520	6583520	I have not.
6583520	6585520	Well we're going to time I get one.
6585520	6586520	It's bad.
6586520	6587520	We're going to.
6587520	6590520	We're about to make podcast history.
6590520	6594520	She's not like I mean I see you know the line forms on the right.
6594520	6596520	I'm the only one.
6596520	6597520	My only one.
6597520	6599520	It's like Jesus.
6599520	6602520	I'm like what is with this relationship.
6602520	6604520	Someone said relax your job.
6604520	6605520	Hey Gwen Gwen Gwen.
6605520	6608520	There's this blow job obsession and I'm like what is the big deal.
6608520	6609520	I don't get it.
6609520	6610520	It hurts.
6610520	6613520	It actually hurts.
6613520	6615520	You've been hanging out with the wrong people man.
6615520	6617520	I want to make sure.
6617520	6618520	What's happening.
6618520	6621520	Are they like it feels like they're trying to pull it out.
6621520	6623520	And I'm like calm down.
6623520	6624520	Like do it.
6624520	6626520	You know like I guess.
6626520	6627520	Yeah I have to.
6627520	6628520	I need more experience.
6628520	6633520	Don't I use your words.
6633520	6634520	Take out of your mouth for a second.
6634520	6635520	Sorry to.

6638520	6639520	Yeah.
6639520	6640520	You've never worked for me.
6640520	6641520	That's so sad.
6641520	6642520	I'm not a fan of the bull blow job.
6642520	6643520	You should move to Iowa.
6643520	6644520	He's right.
6644520	6645520	He's right.
6645520	6646520	He's right.
6646520	6647520	Yeah.
6647520	6648520	It's just it doesn't work for me.

6670520	6672520	Is there anything I said that you're like wait a minute.
6672520	6675520	You just said some shit that like actually perpetuates a thing.
