0	11280	I said hey, hey, hey, hey, hey Well come on everybody, take a trip with me
11280	15040	From Hollywood, CA meltdown, Cominix, Harpentown is now in session
15040	16960	Everybody's after me
16960	22480	And I'm a harper, so I'm coming on the honey, honey line
22480	26320	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harpentown, Mr. Jan Harmon
26320	32640	Thank you, thank you very much
32640	36440	Mr. Seppi, please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harpentown, Mr. Seppi, down in New
36440	37440	Orleans
37440	40560	I think we can, I think we can owe that warmness to our warmup guy
40560	41560	Yeah
41560	42560	Was that Kevin?
42560	43560	Did Kevin come out?
43560	46680	It feels like a real TV show, I thought, is there someone juggling out there?
46680	49800	Is there an actual proper TV warmup guy?
49800	52600	That's Kevin Day, for those of you who are probably on the Reddit, maybe know that Kevin
52600	58600	Day has arrived along with our ambition to just, this is all a hobby, all this shit,
58600	64420	I'm just a rich, fat asshole that's just like, I'm not trying to accomplish anything other
64420	69880	than just seeing what the hell we can accomplish, but Kevin Day is like the Alfred to my Batman,
69880	74240	the microchip to my Punisher
74240	80080	I love that he came out and did warmup, that's sort of a, it's a really triumphant Asperger
80080	81080	story
82080	86080	I'm starting to think he might, he might not have Asperger's
86080	91080	There are so many cameras, I want cameras on how many cameras we have
91080	96920	We have like these racks of cameras like Velcroed to Pillars and things here in this, this pretty
96920	104240	unfilmable site and, hello, and then there's like, there's Chris back there who's a genius
104240	108720	who's like, here's my goal, I haven't really been on the record about this, what are you
108720	112280	doing Dan Harmon, what are you doing, is the podcast going to change, are you doing anything?
112280	116720	No, if all you do is listen to the podcast and when you cut your character on the way
116720	120920	to work, you're doing fine, you can always do that, who cares, who gives a shit, it costs
120920	125520	me nothing to do it, to talk and it costs you nothing to listen
125520	130520	Your camera slice is a show on your camera right now
130520	135680	We're filming your personal details right now
135680	140160	See that's Kevin, he's like, he's a hacker, he thinks like that
140160	144560	He's Alfred, he's like, Mr. Wayne, you should know that Deadshot has the ability to holographically
144560	148000	simulate your next move
148000	149920	Why would you be thinking about that?
149920	156320	Because, because if I, because if Kevin were working for the dark side, we'd all be dead
156320	159880	I was just told tonight's the last show where I get to use music of my choosing that we
159880	163320	have to go to, we have to go to like a non-licensed music from now on
163320	165240	That is one thing that I will admit is
165240	168840	Yeah, show's over everybody
168840	173200	I think, I think that's, I think, you know, that is the one thing it's like, that is a
173200	174200	price we will pay
174200	180440	Can we just do it until someone tells us to stop?
180440	184160	Like remember, there was a show on channel 101 called House of Cosby's where I did a
184160	188160	voice on, Justin Roiland made it and then we got a call from Cosby's people, it's like
188160	189160	stop doing that
189160	194720	We got five or six House of Cosby's out before that happened and then we just stopped doing
194720	195720	House of Cosby's
195720	196720	Yeah
196720	197720	Stop doing that
197720	204280	I'm busy, I'm busy with the women's and the drugs and
204280	205280	Oh boy
205280	210000	Come to my cabin to discuss the creative endeavors
210000	211000	Okay
211000	214920	Well, whatever, hey, could, alright, let's not
214920	216440	It's not too soon for that shit
217240	219000	Some things it's supposed to be too soon
219000	225440	Some of the other, so anyways, I didn't really get around to it
225440	229320	What you're watching is like, I don't know, I'm like the Howard Hughes of Narcissism
229320	231320	I'm just, I'm just, I don't know, I'm just
231320	234040	Howard Hughes was the Howard Hughes of Narcissism
234040	235360	I'm just seeing what we can do
235360	240760	I guarantee you one thing, you'll never, anything that you haven't, that you've never paid for
240760	244280	You're never gonna start paying for it, I'm not gonna suddenly tell you, that cost a quarter
244280	245280	I don't think
246120	253000	I don't, I, I, I, I, what I, what I am going to do experimentally because my fantasy as
253000	256840	a Minecraft player is like about autonomy, like efficiency
256840	263320	I want to create like a solar powered, like, like, like, biodome of a, of a, of a, of a
263320	268640	video podcast where like all these guys like Chris back there, Dustin, our producer, Kevin
268640	273480	and people who help us, if they could draw salaries off of all of the energy that they
273480	278480	put into the show, if people were on a subscription basis, which seems to be the model that kind
278480	282280	of works, if people are willing to pay for things that they want, if they want to go
282280	286720	the extra mile, they're making a donation at the same time as they're buying the product
286720	287880	they're subscribing to it
287880	291920	I'm going with the porn model because, because the truth is
291920	294440	What's her name?
294440	299480	For 20 years, you know, rich, rich white men have been trying to figure out how to monetize
299480	305880	the internet, but almost as soon as it started a, a class of very independently minded, like,
305880	310640	poor women immediately figured out, like, you'd think that they were being exploited
310640	313520	every time you see like, that there's a lot of exploitation of pornography and I'm sure
313520	319040	there is, but there's also a lot of very impressive, like, it's, there's a lot of entrepreneurship
319040	324080	and like independent, like, like people that know how to sell themselves can do so very
324080	325080	well on the internet.
325080	326080	And that's what you can do.
326080	330560	I was thinking, let's take a page from their playbook, like, if you love me so much that
330560	336360	you can't get enough, if you want my dirty panties, like, that's what you got to pay
336360	337760	for.
337760	343400	If you want to, if you want to just see something, you can probably get it illegally.
343400	346200	Give me a, for instance, there, like, what do you mean?
346200	347200	There's no, for instance.
347200	348200	What's your dirty panties version?
348200	353320	No, the dirty panties is the video feeds of, yeah, that's the dirty panties.
353320	355080	It's the, it's what you can see.
355680	356680	Yeah.
356680	358960	All right.
358960	362160	It's bad to start a show talking about the show.
362160	370800	It's like trying to fuel a lawnmower on lawnmower, liquid, instead of gasoline.
370800	371800	It shouldn't do that.
371800	373400	The lawnmower won't start.
373400	378440	We should have started with my new segment, questions about grocery stores.
385080	398840	How much, how much, how much, how much do you, it's starting off great.
398840	399840	I love this segment.
399840	401880	I really love this segment.
401880	402880	Cyber bullied.
402880	407960	Don't, don't abuse this camera with camera tapes.
407960	411200	Now they can see that I'm a human being.
411200	418240	I'm a victim.
418240	420600	Also we know your driver's license, uh, info.
420600	425080	Well, and that was going to happen no matter, yeah, that's a good point, I guess, but I
425080	426080	might.
426080	427080	Is that on the outside of your phone?
427080	428080	What was happening there?
428080	433640	Well, it's, yeah, it's, I bend it over backwards and all right, okay, I'll tell you one thing
433640	440940	as a Sony employee, this is the least of my fucking worries considering the news considers
440940	445020	it juicy that Joel McHale got a discount on a TV.
445020	448580	You don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm telling you like sooner or later, like
448580	452500	boy, oh boy, I'm good at emails.
452500	459380	And I've been working for Sony for six years and the shit you know is juicy.
459380	465340	I am good at emails, so read a couple for us.
465340	466340	Get fired again, man.
466340	470620	I remember, remember how exciting it was when you got fired last time.
470620	473380	We went on a tour and made a movie, it was great.
473380	476740	Okay, so anyways, uh, what was the segment?
476740	477740	Grocery store questions.
477740	478740	How-
478740	497740	Yeah, yeah, all that music goes away is next fucking harmotown, I'm gonna do as many musical
497740	502540	things in the show as I possibly could, so Bill Cosby himself calls me up and says don't
502540	503540	do it.
503540	505540	It felt like Big Red was back, didn't it?
505540	506540	Oh, I miss Big Red.
506540	507540	Where did he go?
507540	508540	He died in a show and he's exploded.
508540	509540	Is that right?
509540	518940	It's always too soon for Adam Goldberg.
518940	525580	Adam Goldberg is so jealous of the most loved person to ever come up on stage.
525580	532740	I guess the hamburglar probably hates grimace, goes home at night, just stabs his grimace
532740	539660	eyes and then, uh, the, um, I, Christmas or no, not Christmas questions.
539660	541340	That's our next segment.
541340	542340	Grocery store questions.
542340	543340	How much-
543340	550540	How much do you think one costs?
550540	551540	A grocery store?
551540	555220	Yeah, how much, if you wanted to buy a grocery store, filled with stuff.
555220	556220	Yeah.
556220	557220	Employees, the whole, the trucks, delivery.
557220	558220	The employees?
558220	559220	I don't know.
559220	561900	You're saying just, if you want to buy one outright.
561900	565580	Yeah, like, like, like, like, I guess let's, let's keep, let's keep the fact that it's
565580	572780	like a business and let's, let's just go with all of the things in a grocery store minus
572780	573940	the things in back.
573940	576820	I think you get one for $350,000.
576820	578800	I think that takes it away.
578800	580220	That seems very conservative to me.
580220	581220	All right, okay.
581220	582220	I feel like-
582220	583220	$350,000 in one dollar.
583220	584220	Adam, shut the fuck up.
585220	589820	And obviously, you're saying that all of the Skittles, all of the marshmallows, all the
589820	592780	frying pans, all the pantyhose, they all add up to $350,000.
592780	594220	You're just saying all the stuff out of the shelves.
594220	598820	The furniture too, like the, the cash registers and all the apparatus or just, just the items
598820	599820	that you could buy in there.
599820	603500	I'm just saying all the shit on the shelves in the public area.
603500	605300	Anybody, let's, let's start the bidding.
605300	606300	What do you guys think?
606300	607300	125.
607300	608300	125?
608300	609300	That's-
609300	610300	2 million three.
610300	611900	No, that's too much.
611900	615180	You think all the food in a supermarket costs $2 million?
615180	616180	5.
616180	617180	1 million.
617180	620420	I haven't even actually thought of my own guess, but I guess 2 million three does sound
620420	622860	high, but I actually, I was like, now we're talking.
622860	625980	Okay, let's, let's highball it at 2 million three.
625980	626980	Let's say that's the number.
626980	628380	Let's, let's, let's call it 2 million three.
628380	629380	Well, what do you mean?
629380	630380	Let's say that's the number.
630380	631980	This is part of your premise, is how much does it cost?
631980	632980	Oh, no, no, no.
632980	633980	I, well, I, okay.
633980	634980	Well, I'm sorry.
634980	638780	What was the name of this segment again?
638780	639780	It's grocery store questions.
639780	658340	Our show is eating itself.
658340	663100	I, uh, what I was wondering, I was in a grocery store recently, which is a rarity for me since
663100	664780	I was 35.
664780	667860	And I found out that you can escape that life.
667860	669380	By having an assistant or what?
669380	676780	Yeah, or a girlfriend or, okay, combinations thereof, different services, websites, whatever
676780	678540	I do to, whatever I can do to stay out of the place.
678540	681100	So you rarely walk physically into a supermarket.
681100	682780	I try not to.
682780	686220	Bad place for bad people.
686220	690220	But my, but, but before that, before 35, I spent a lot of time in them.
690220	691380	It's a common location.
691380	696460	I always, I find myself wondering, for instance, like what would happen if, uh, centipedes
696460	702940	attacked like, like giant centipedes, like, like centipedes the size of Doberman's, attacked
702940	703940	a grocery store.
703940	706740	Like, where would you hide, like, like, I think about that stuff.
706740	708500	I would, I would write a script about that.
708500	711340	I would set it in a grocery store and I would feel comfortable doing that because I've spent
711340	712340	a lot of time.
712340	713660	I've logged in my grocery store hours.
713660	718540	Where would you hide from Doberman size centipedes inside a Trader Joe's?
718540	723380	I would, I would, well, I would, I would, I'm assuming that they're coming in like the
723380	724380	front door.
724380	725380	Okay.
725940	730020	So first there would be this like period of like, Jesus Christ, what's happening?
730020	732900	Someone's screaming and everyone flocks to the screaming.
732900	735340	And then you see that there's like the CG monster.
735340	737780	Are these Doberman size centipedes out to kill people?
737780	738780	Like, okay.
738780	739780	They're after people.
739780	740780	Yeah.
740780	741780	They're monsters.
741780	742780	This is a movie.
742780	743780	Okay.
743780	746220	And so there's like a CG centipede, like killing, I don't know, Susan Sarandon or whatever.
746220	748740	It's like a cameo who's like the first to die.
748740	753540	You got, you got her so you could get funding the, uh, and so she's getting eaten and then,
753580	757660	and then there's going to be a guy who's like the most heroic, but the first to the second
757660	758660	to die.
758660	762060	Cause he grabs like a egg beater and goes like, what the fuck?
762060	763060	What the fuck?
763060	767420	And then the, and he's like, he's like a really cast by who, who do you cast?
767420	768420	Who's your guy?
768420	769420	That's Chris Pratt for sure.
769420	775820	Cause again, he's a cameo and he's like, listen, we'll drag your body out and set it on fire
775820	778340	in the first act and just come by for a day of shooting.
778340	780700	I'd really appreciate it.
780700	783780	It's like somebody like charges the thing with an egg beater and it's like the big
783780	785940	beefy guy that you thought was the hero.
785940	789340	Because of course this is an ironic age and you have to remove that guy.
789340	793620	It's like the post survivor world of it's not the alpha male, uh, you were counting
793620	801500	on it's the, you know, it's the, um, whoever the new, uh, uh, uh, who's that IBM PC kid?
801500	810180	Uh, John Long, long, long, long, long, Justin long, I'm sure he's 53 now, but whoever the
810180	815100	new him is, uh, assuming someone from yo gabba gabba, I don't know.
815100	818860	What do you, what do you people watch?
818860	824860	Some Pokemon would like, and he's like, I'm only at the grocery store cause I have asthma.
824860	828500	Oh, I have to fight the centipedes.
828500	830940	I know all about them.
830940	837860	Now who the hell invited this goddamn centipede expert to our grocery store?
838740	843380	Also who keeps inviting people to our grocery store?
843380	845380	Also what's Bryce taking?
845380	850020	I've been a, I've been a meat salesman for 35 goddamn years.
850020	852020	This is my Keith David impression.
852020	855060	This is a good cast so far.
855060	856060	Yeah.
856060	857060	Yeah.
857060	861860	He's, he, he works at, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the, he's the pivot.
861860	863540	He's the, he's the black guy in the monster movie.
863540	864540	What am I?
864540	865540	Why am I?
865540	866860	Why am I mincing words?
866860	869780	He's Keith David and he works in the butcher section and he's like, God damn it.
869780	871940	What are these goddamn centipedes going on?
871940	876140	And then, and then when the kid, the kid starts going like, uh, he's like, actually that species
876140	885700	wouldn't technically be called a centipede if they can see heat, but not color or something.
885700	889140	And then Keith David's the one that goes like, God damn it, am I taking orders from my boss
889140	891060	or this goddamn nerd over here?
891060	894340	But then he, like, he's the guy, all I know is that this kid said three things and they
894340	898380	all turned out to be right and everything you're saying.
898380	902060	And then every time the kid says something like a centipede's follow, there's a thermographic
902060	903060	entity.
903060	904060	Wait a minute.
904060	908300	Are you telling me these goddamn things can see heat and that's his job translate for
908300	909300	the streets.
909300	910900	All right.
910900	911900	Where was that?
911900	920460	My question about grocery stores is
920460	921860	we're moving way too slow.
921860	927540	I got a list of shit.
927540	933380	My question about grocery stores is how, I, the reason I want to know how much they cost
933380	940380	is because I want to buy one because I want to know how easy is it to push over the shelves?
940380	942780	The whole thing.
942780	943780	Yeah.
943780	948500	Cause you always think of it when you walk in, like you think that you're in a room and
948500	952700	that like part of the room is that there's these aisles, but those are just things they
952700	954120	put up.
954120	958460	The reality of a grocery store is it's a big empty warehouse and they just put up these
958460	964100	like shitty, I just wonder like if you, I want to like run up and like, like, like,
964100	969100	like, I want to push, like how hard would you have to push to knock over a whole grocery
969100	974100	store?
974100	979780	Well, I feel like I understand a library, like, like, like, feel like, like, like, I
979780	983620	feel like I know when I look at a library shelf, like what, what I would have to push
983620	985780	to make it happen.
985780	989900	And I don't even, but I don't even, but also it's like, let's see if that feels profane,
989900	990900	lady.
990900	995220	I think if you went at the bread, the bread aisle, that would be the lightest one because
995220	996660	bread is like very airy.
996660	999140	I think you can take down the frozen foods.
999140	1001140	I don't think it has a lot to do with the content.
1001140	1006100	I don't know if those things are anchored to the ground or if they just like, yeah,
1006100	1007820	did anyone work in a grocery store here?
1007820	1009740	Did you work in a grocery store?
1009740	1010740	You worked at a super target?
1010740	1012740	What's a super target?
1012740	1021060	Please welcome our first guest, super target employee.
1021060	1028100	What's your name?
1028100	1029100	It's Scoota.
1029100	1030100	Scoota?
1030100	1031100	Yeah.
1032060	1033260	What's your name?
1033260	1034260	Someone said fake.
1034260	1035260	Is it an acronym?
1035260	1036260	Self-contained underwater?
1036260	1037260	My last name.
1037260	1038260	Target employee.
1038260	1039260	Yeah.
1039260	1040260	So it's my last name.
1040260	1045140	My first name is Matt, but I'm from a place that had like too many Matt's, so it's easier
1045140	1046740	to go by my last name.
1046740	1047740	All right.
1047740	1048740	Was it Scoota?
1048740	1049740	Like you have an accent and you sing Scooter?
1049740	1050740	Or is it?
1050740	1051740	It's S-K-U-T-A.
1051740	1052740	S-K-U-T-A.
1052740	1053740	Scoota.
1053740	1054740	Scoota.
1054740	1055740	And then the T is usually pronounced with a D for some reason.
1055740	1056740	Scoota.
1056740	1057740	Yeah.
1057740	1058740	All right.
1058740	1059740	Scoota.
1059740	1060740	Scoota.
1060740	1061740	Scoota.
1061740	1062740	Super target.
1062740	1063740	Talk.
1063740	1064740	Tell us about it.
1064740	1069140	So they're not out here for some reason, but there's several different types of targets.
1069140	1075180	There's the normal target.
1075180	1082020	If Liam Neeson did this speech, it would be terrifying.
1082020	1085700	There's something called a P-Fresh target, and those are the ones that are out here.
1085700	1086700	P-Fresh?
1086700	1087700	Yeah.
1087700	1090500	Is that like some horrible cynical attempt with the urban demographic?
1090500	1097820	I think the P stands for produce, so it's like it's a slightly bigger target that has
1097820	1101900	a produce section and a relatively big grocery section.
1101900	1108380	And then a super target has a full grocery section, including like a butcher deli.
1108380	1110380	A candlestick maker.
1110380	1112540	So they're just bigger.
1112540	1113540	Wow.
1113540	1114540	Super target.
1114540	1115540	All right.
1115540	1116540	So you worked on a super target.
1116540	1120260	You've worked around these shelving units that grocery stores and things have.
1120260	1123340	So are they fixed to the floor?
1123340	1126620	The only ones that are kind of fixed to the floor is like the frozen sections, like you
1126620	1127620	mentioned.
1127620	1130820	They do have a lot of electrical stuffs that they are nailed down.
1130820	1135460	All the other shelves are just really bottom heavy, because we do like a seasonal time.
1135460	1141660	Like we're getting real information about life hacking.
1141660	1144900	We would be the best trivia team if we all went to a bar and played bar trip.
1144900	1146260	So they put heavy shit on the bottom.
1147260	1151580	So an empty shelf is incredibly bottom heavy.
1151580	1157060	And then, yeah, when they do like they do like the planograms, that's the way you get
1157060	1158060	a sheet.
1158060	1159060	Planograms.
1159060	1160260	And that is how you're supposed to set up the shelf.
1160260	1162260	Like what goes on the bottom, what goes in the middle?
1162260	1164220	Who decides that?
1164220	1166780	There are people who that is their job.
1166780	1171700	At Target or how much does Big Snicker like?
1171700	1174540	So Big Snicker has a lot of say in it.
1174540	1179860	There are certain parts of the store where it's like, we really want it this way.
1179860	1183140	And then there are certain things that are like, well, you know, flexibility here.
1183140	1187300	And then as things like sell out, like in the store, we can't have empty shelves.
1187300	1193460	So people have to go around and then decide how we're going to flex out the shelves.
1193460	1194460	Is that what they call it?
1194460	1195460	Yeah.
1195460	1196460	It's called flexing.
1196460	1198460	They're trying to make you feel like you're working for Patrick Swayze.
1198460	1201420	You don't work at a super target.
1201420	1202780	This is a fucking bank heist.
1202780	1203780	Let's flex out.
1203780	1204780	No.
1204780	1211500	An insane thing about Target is like the, I think like the slogan is like expect more
1211500	1217260	pay less, but the corporate slogan is the greatest company ever.
1217260	1224580	So like, so not, no, nowhere where you'd see, but if you go like in the back room or if
1224580	1228980	you go like in the break room, there are these posters on the wall, like 1984, where it's
1228980	1234820	Target's headquarters in like, uh, Minnesota, Milwaukee, somewhere in somewhere up north.
1234820	1236900	And it just has like a giant animated target logo.
1236900	1239700	And then in big bold letters, or I think it might be the best company ever.
1239700	1241700	So the best company ever.
1241700	1246620	And it's like, and it's okay.
1246620	1249380	God himself couldn't destroy Target.
1249380	1251500	I defy you, Lord.
1251500	1254500	I've never been blown away by it, but I guess, I guess it's the best company ever.
1254500	1258940	All I know about Target is once in a while for some sad reason, you have to go to Target
1258940	1260940	and you have to go get a thing.
1260940	1261940	God damn it.
1261940	1263980	I need a, I need a, I need a trash can for my kitchen.
1263980	1265580	I got to go to fucking Target.
1265580	1268500	And then it's the most depressing afternoon of your life.
1268500	1269580	It's the worst.
1269580	1270580	It's not super.
1270580	1271580	Yeah.
1271580	1272740	I want to say about Target though.
1272740	1274580	When I was, how old are you Scoota?
1274580	1276580	You look like I can ask.
1276580	1277580	23.
1277580	1278580	I was going to say 23.
1278580	1284100	Like around, around, around that age, when you, when I was getting my first like steps
1284100	1289460	into like, oh, I, I have an apartment or whatever that, like I have a property.
1289460	1292060	I, uh, I need a plunger.
1292060	1296700	I need a dish rack and that, and it's Target, well, at least in Wisconsin, it was, it was
1296700	1303380	like, that is the synagogue you go to, to, you know, achieve manhood, uh, very late manhood
1303380	1308740	in an infantilized, uh, empire where you're like picking your dish rack and you're like,
1308740	1315460	oh, there's eight kinds of, of, of brush that I thought just grew out of my mom and
1315460	1318580	that I now realize I need because it was like, there's shit everywhere.
1318580	1320660	Oh, mom used a brush.
1320660	1322220	There's a brush aisle at Target.
1322220	1323220	It's like kind of fun.
1323220	1327980	Like Target is sort of a religious, like, it's like a, like a little cove in the woods
1327980	1328980	for me.
1328980	1331260	I'm sure there's other stores that accomplish that fact.
1331260	1332460	How long did you work at Target Scoota?
1332460	1335620	Uh, so I worked there for like 2008 to 2012.
1335620	1340340	And would you climb the ranks, I'm hoping there's names for your job description that
1340340	1341340	are very hilarious.
1341340	1342340	Kind of.
1342340	1343340	Yeah.
1343340	1347420	So I started as a cashier and then, and that is genuinely the worst job ever.
1347420	1348420	Really?
1348420	1349420	Yeah.
1349420	1351340	So, or at least I thought it wasn't just, I, you have to deal with, so you're kind of
1351340	1355140	dealing with people kind of constantly and, and their main, like, you know, people like
1355140	1357740	to make the jokes and those get annoying very quickly.
1357740	1361660	Like if you're, if you're just a little bit too slow scanning something, the person will
1361660	1363500	go, oh, I guess it's free.
1363500	1365980	And you just want, yeah, you really wanted to just kind of throw it in the bag, go,
1365980	1366980	yep, it is.
1366980	1367980	Now you're stealing.
1367980	1373260	I feel like it's all free in your car too.
1373260	1374260	Yeah.
1374260	1376580	So, so I was having like, so I was kind of dealing with kind of those same jokes over
1376580	1377580	and over again.
1377580	1378580	It became incredibly frustrating.
1378580	1380860	So when anything ever needed to be done in the store, like we need someone to take out
1380860	1381860	the trash.
1381860	1382860	I was like, I will do it.
1382860	1387380	So they're like, oh, this guy really, he's really trying to work hard and not just not
1387380	1388380	talk to people.
1388380	1389380	Just to get away from people.
1389380	1390540	Just to get away from the check lanes.
1390540	1393860	Cause I didn't, I didn't like that to kind of the repetition there.
1393860	1398660	And so I ended up, I did, uh, I volunteered to be trained on the cart pusher in the parking
1398660	1399660	lot.
1399660	1400660	So I pushed, sorry.
1400660	1401660	I went and did that.
1401660	1403260	And then I did a guest service.
1403260	1406100	So you're like Charlie Sheen in platoon, like you were a cashier.
1406100	1407380	And then you're like, can I go on?
1407380	1408380	Can I go push carts?
1408380	1415540	So another really bizarre thing was Keith David out there is why are you pushing cards?
1415540	1418340	Sniffing that cross man, I'm pushing down by the river.
1418980	1422380	We got ourselves a goddamn hero.
1422380	1423380	We got here as a crusader.
1423380	1424380	Oh yeah.
1424380	1425380	Okay.
1425380	1429620	Like, like another thing with like the newspeak though is like, uh, you can't, uh, if you,
1429620	1435660	if you're heard by one of your higher ups, your team leads, uh, calling a customer or
1435660	1438660	sorry, a guest, a customer, you'll get a talking to guests.
1438660	1439660	Yeah.
1439660	1440660	It's like, they're guests.
1440660	1441660	You have to call them guests.
1441660	1442660	And when is carousel?
1442660	1443660	17%.
1444660	1451020	17% 17% as we all slowly die.
1451020	1454580	The irony is, it's a Logan's run joke about how when you're so old, you have to die.
1454580	1455580	All right.
1455580	1456580	Well, it's good.
1456580	1458780	I got a full plate tonight.
1458780	1459780	You're lovely.
1459780	1462060	I think we could have done a two hour target show.
1462060	1463060	You're charismatic.
1463060	1464920	You're full of, you're full of energy.
1464920	1469220	You make everyone pumped with target steam.
1469220	1470220	Let's have a hand for Scooter.
1474660	1485700	Very, very fresh faced, like a Boy Scout energy.
1485700	1488620	I like Scooter and target didn't crush his soul.
1488620	1493780	Like, it seems like that's either nice or it's either uplifting or horrible.
1493780	1497380	I worked, I worked at a trader Joe's briefly when I was 17 and it was the worst.
1497380	1498380	All right.
1498380	1501060	I'm going to go down to the checklist and we're going to start triaging because there's
1501060	1504220	things that will just, did, did, did we answer your question about knocking things over in
1504220	1505220	a supermarket?
1505220	1506220	No.
1506220	1507220	Well, you know what?
1507220	1508220	Yeah.
1508220	1509220	They're, they're bottom heavy.
1509220	1510220	It's like, it kind of makes, makes more sense.
1510220	1513420	Like Scooter, if, if you, me and Dan ran with all of our might towards, let's call it the
1513420	1518820	bread aisle, if we, if we went right at the center of it and at the highest, like the
1518820	1522380	highest center of gravity and we just tried to knock it over, could three people knock
1522380	1523380	it over?
1523380	1524380	I don't think so.
1524380	1527020	I think you could dent one of the shelves and the shelves are also removable.
1527020	1531020	So I think those are, how many people would it take to knock over a full thing and start
1531020	1532020	a domino effect down, down the thing?
1532020	1533020	Right.
1533020	1534020	I think it'd be hard to do it because if you said it's bottom heavy, but the bottom shelf
1534020	1535020	is like, you know, it's like six feet.
1535020	1536020	So you can't, your arms aren't long enough to do it.
1536020	1537020	I think they thought about this.
1537020	1538020	Did you hear that?
1538020	1539020	Did you hear that America?
1539020	1540020	The ownership class has thought about it.
1540020	1541020	Have you?
1541020	1542020	Your move.
1542020	1565420	I don't get the, okay.
1565420	1566420	All right.
1566420	1568820	I was really compelled to talk about Lena Dunham tonight.
1568820	1570060	I can sum it up.
1570060	1571060	Just leave her alone.
1571060	1574460	Fuck you if you're like trying to burn her at the stake.
1574460	1575460	Okay.
1575460	1576460	Moving on.
1576460	1578140	You can Google that.
1578140	1585220	Our friend Linnehan was here last week and I'd noticed him tweeting something about Ms.
1585220	1587340	Dunham and then I went down a rabbit hole Googling.
1587340	1589780	What's he talking about?
1589780	1595540	She's undergoing what I would describe as a Salem level of like a witch hunt.
1595540	1599780	I guess that's a hot topic, but, and I don't imagine we have a lot of people in the audience
1599780	1604140	going like, oh no, you don't have all the facts or I want to really be a, I think it's
1604140	1607480	more of a right wing, left wing thing, which I also don't give a fuck about.
1607480	1611660	But it's like there's some time there are moments in this, in this, in this culture
1611660	1618140	and our new hashtaggy social justice, like awareness of each other and everything's evolving.
1618140	1622380	There are moments when there are things that you could do are that are brave and there
1622380	1625660	are things that you can do that are, that are not brave and you don't always have to
1625660	1629700	do brave things, but I would urge people to knock over the bread.
1630500	1635100	To run everything that you're about to do or say through a little one item checklist,
1635100	1640300	which is, is this, do I risk anything by saying this or doing this?
1640300	1642220	Because if you don't, then it's not brave.
1642220	1645300	Are you making a gesture at me or are you rubbing your, okay.
1645300	1653180	I'm like, I'm like, I, it's like, no, no, wait, the new president just got elected.
1653180	1654180	He's a misogynist.
1655180	1658180	Got to cut it, cut it, cut it, cut the segment, cut the segment.
1660980	1662980	I mean, just, just, just Google it.
1662980	1667980	I think it's a, I think what's happening to her is fascinating.
1667980	1673480	She is a creative, she shares things, she expresses things, she explores things.
1673480	1678680	There are people who don't like young women with power.
1678680	1682780	I'm not being, I'm not trying to get a jump on a bandwagon.
1682980	1687080	I think it's actually, there are times when it's actually difficult to be a feminist.
1687080	1690580	There are times when it's difficult to be progressive.
1690580	1694180	When, and I think that she's being ganged up on right now.
1694180	1697980	It took me a very long time to get to the bottom of what was going on.
1697980	1703120	There was a lot of shit on the surface that, that, that threatens to suffocate,
1703120	1705880	like what, what is actually, what, what the deal is.
1705880	1710580	I urge you to Google it and, and explore it because I think it's edifying.
1710580	1714580	I think it's very interesting and I won't, I won't bother with any more time with that
1714580	1716980	because there's probably a million podcasts that talk about it and you can,
1716980	1721280	you can do your own exploring, but I, I, I, ultimately it's like, what do we do?
1721280	1727780	I just, I just want to know what is it and I, I, I, why is it that when these things come up, why,
1727780	1735280	what is it in us, what is it in our national psyche where we, when we hear about,
1735280	1741280	for instance, the topic of sexual assault or rape, that we, that we, we, that,
1741280	1747280	what, what muscle is it in us that flexes where we have to figure out if it's right or wrong
1747280	1748980	or provable or all these things.
1748980	1750180	Like what are we doing?
1750180	1752380	It's a question that needs to be asked.
1752380	1756980	It doesn't have to come down to some battlefield where you're for or against anything.
1756980	1761580	What, what is important as is, whether it is like, like all of these, you know,
1761580	1765480	the last week when we talked, we were talking about police brutality and all these things,
1765480	1769480	the questions that we emerge with are the important things to ask.
1769480	1770980	What is the role of police?
1770980	1776680	And I think like, like, what is, what is the point when somebody talks about sexual assault,
1776680	1779680	talks about rape, talk, talk, whether they're joking about it,
1779680	1783380	whether they're exploring it in a memoir, whether they're, I don't know,
1783380	1789180	there's probably eight other ways you could, you could, you could dance around that, that hot fire.
1789880	1792280	What, is there a responsibility?
1792280	1794080	Are we supposed to, are we policing it?
1794080	1796180	What is our, what is our role?
1796180	1799180	Why is it that we respond in certain ways to certain people?
1799180	1801080	Just let's ask ourselves that.
1801080	1804580	I, I, I spent the day going down a rabbit hole.
1804580	1809380	It's like, I, as, as our friend Graham said in his tweet,
1809380	1813280	I think that if you can judge people by who, who their enemies are,
1813280	1817280	I think, you know, Lena Dunham is, well, I can't remember how we put it.
1817380	1819380	She's, she's, she's Christ.
1819380	1819680	I don't know.
1819680	1825080	That's not what he said, but she's, she's, she's, she's being ganged up on it.
1825080	1826880	It's, it's pretty fucked up.
1826880	1829380	All right. Christmas questions.
1829380	1834480	Now we can put that off till after New Year's sniffers.
1834480	1835980	I don't like people who sniff things.
1835980	1840080	Okay, give me a, for instance, on that one.
1840080	1841180	I just don't like sniffers.
1841180	1842080	Like, I don't know.
1842080	1843680	I'm not going to judge them.
1843680	1847180	People walk into a shop and sniff something or are they, like, what do you mean?
1848080	1849580	We better bring out our guests.
1851080	1853480	No, not, not until you've explained sniffers to me.
1853580	1854780	There's people who sniff things.
1854780	1856180	There's people, there's people in the audience.
1856180	1857680	I would love to talk to a sniffer.
1857680	1859180	I dated a sniffer once.
1860080	1861380	I need to know what you're talking about.
1861380	1863880	Like on a day to day, people who sniff, they sniff things,
1863880	1865580	even though they know they're going to smell bad.
1865580	1866280	Like they sniff.
1866280	1870280	They look like pick up a piece of shit off the, and it's like, what are you doing?
1870280	1873180	Don't, why are you, why did you do that?
1873180	1874080	Why did you sniff that?
1874080	1876180	It's like a thing you found in a mailbox.
1876180	1877080	I'm doing a camera take.
1879880	1880680	Let's bring out.
1881880	1882780	No, no, no, no, no.
1884280	1885680	Why, who's, who's sniffing what?
1885680	1886980	Why are people sniffing things?
1886980	1887980	Like, I don't know.
1887980	1890480	Are you talking about someone that goes into a bakery and goes, this muffin.
1890480	1891680	Do I want this muffin or that muffin?
1891680	1893780	They sniff the muffin or sniff a muffin.
1896180	1898780	Your experience there is like defined by margins.
1898780	1900680	Like it's either going to be a bad smelling muffin.
1900680	1902480	Who is, who is sniffing what wrong?
1902980	1903680	I don't understand.
1904280	1907380	There are people who obsessively sniff everything they're about to eat.
1907380	1909880	They sniff, and they sniff like shit that they find.
1909880	1913480	Like, they go like, like, what is this thing on the side of the napkin dispenser?
1913480	1915480	Like, like, like, like brown.
1916380	1918580	And then they'll be like, why are you sniffing it?
1918580	1919280	Wait, wait, wait.
1919280	1921480	What, who did this?
1921480	1923480	There's got to be a sniffer in this audience.
1923480	1925080	Does anybody, is this resonating at all?
1925080	1926680	There's a guy that's kind of like that.
1926680	1928880	I'm telling you, I think it's like some kind of tick.
1928880	1930380	That you have to sniff things.
1930380	1931180	You got to sniff it.
1931180	1934180	Even something that you know is going to smell like something bad probably.
1934180	1935080	It's too time consuming.
1935080	1936780	The guy that worked at Target.
1936780	1939880	I'll fucking, I want to talk about sniffing for the rest of my life.
1939880	1945780	Let's talk about sniffing with, my compulsion is to bring up both guests at once.
1945780	1950480	So that we can, let's bring out Kumail Nanjiani and John Roy.
1961180	1966980	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1966980	1969480	If you sit too close to me, then it means you're gay.
1969480	1971380	Oh, well, fuck then.
1971380	1972580	All right, let's do it.
1972580	1975580	I'm with you on sniffers, anti sniffing.
1975580	1976680	You've met sniffers, right?
1976680	1977380	Oh, yeah.
1977380	1980280	I don't know whether before or against his stance.
1980280	1981180	I don't understand.
1981180	1984980	I haven't fully explained what a sniffer.
1984980	1988480	I don't even like when people are choosing muffins and then they sniff it.
1988480	1989980	Like, don't take some of that.
1989980	1992580	They're loose muffins.
1992580	1994080	Like Starbucks, they have them behind the counter.
1994080	1996080	You can't just look at them and smell.
1996080	1998180	I've been there when they're like, can I see that muffin?
1998180	1999980	And people hand them the muffin from behind the counter.
1999980	2000580	They smell it.
2000580	2001980	And they're like, no, I want a different one.
2001980	2002980	They'll hand it to you?
2002980	2004180	Yeah, they'll do anything.
2008180	2009380	I don't like sniffers.
2009380	2015680	I've known people that will take off their shoe and they'll look at the bottom of it.
2015680	2017880	And there'll be some gum or something on it.
2017880	2019280	And they'll sniff it.
2019280	2020780	Yeah.
2020780	2021280	That's the term.
2021280	2024780	It's bog trotters, not just sniffers, but people who smell something nasty.
2024780	2025580	You can...
2025580	2027380	B-O-G-T-R-O-T-T-E.
2027380	2029080	Oh, that's fantastic.
2029080	2032880	I kind of want to not talk at all for the rest of the show.
2032880	2035480	Sit in silence for an hour and all go home.
2039880	2043880	That would be an amazing thing to do for his birthday.
2043880	2046680	You finally had the last word.
2046680	2047380	It's just wait.
2047380	2053880	Yeah, and give Adam the gift of showing him what would happen if everyone just listened.
2055880	2058880	And then it would be like time enough at last when the glasses break, you know?
2058880	2059880	Yeah, exactly.
2059880	2061480	He's just like, oh, everyone.
2061480	2065680	And then he'd like slowly walk up and he'd be like, and another thing about this.
2065680	2068880	You were saying this other thing earlier and everyone would just keep nodding and listening.
2071580	2072880	Blog trotters?
2072880	2073880	Bog trotters.
2073880	2074880	Bog trotters.
2077380	2082680	I always felt like, you know how when you're at a party and a couple of people are talking
2082680	2088080	and then someone yells out something from across the room and it kind of kills the conversation?
2091580	2092980	That's not happening here.
2095480	2098180	We do have a more open format here.
2098180	2099180	And it's Adam Goldberg.
2099180	2100080	That's his role.
2100080	2102380	Yeah, I mean, that's his role.
2102380	2104880	And our role is to be annoyed by it.
2105880	2107880	John Roy, what do you think of Adam Goldberg?
2107880	2109880	I've never, I don't really know what the issues are.
2111880	2113380	I'm a late comer to this.
2113380	2114380	I don't know anything about the man.
2114380	2115380	I didn't tell you the truth.
2116880	2118380	All right, you guys want something to talk about?
2118380	2121380	Oh, can I say something, one thing real quick about Target?
2121380	2129380	This, we, I was at, this was a Brooklyn Target and this to me encompasses Target and Brooklyn.
2129380	2133380	Emily was walking around and she had a pen in her hand and this guy yelled at her.
2133880	2135880	He was like, why you got a pen in your hand?
2135880	2136880	You're not at work.
2139380	2140380	That's Target.
2140380	2140880	Wow.
2141880	2142880	That's Stargate.
2145880	2146880	It's Stargate.
2148880	2149380	Thank you.
2150380	2152880	A pause break, one man applause break for Stargate.
2152880	2153380	That's right.
2153380	2154880	That's my audience is one person.
2157880	2158880	Was that you, Adam?
2158880	2159380	Yeah.
2159380	2159880	God damn it.
2160880	2163380	I'm, I'm starting to see the issues.
2163380	2166380	I think now, I think I'm, I think I'm getting caught up to speed.
2166380	2167380	Yeah, buddy.
2168880	2170380	I'm with you on the Lena Dunham thing.
2170380	2172880	We don't ever talk about it more, but it really angers me.
2172880	2178380	I think she's so talented and so good and it's, it's, it is so gross.
2178380	2181380	The methodology is the disgusting part.
2181380	2188380	It's not, it's beyond like whether or not so the attempt to make it an issue about whether something is or isn't or is right or is wrong.
2188380	2193880	The methodology that people try to use when they attack people, like, is very telling.
2193880	2194880	It's very disgusting.
2194880	2198880	Like, like, like the, it just grosses me out.
2198880	2203380	It really is like, it sums it up to say like, wow, you really, she's really an important person.
2203380	2215880	She really fucking is forcing like weird ooze to come out of the ground on all sides all around because who had any idea that this was, that this was still needed to be resolved.
2215880	2219380	Like this idea that you can't as a fuck.
2219380	2220380	Well, we're talking about it now.
2220380	2223380	She's going to be making awesome stuff for the next 50 years.
2223380	2227380	It's, it's my parents love girls are always telling me to watch it.
2227380	2228380	Is it good?
2228380	2229380	Is it that I really like it?
2229380	2230380	Yeah.
2230380	2231380	Yes, it's good.
2231380	2232380	She's a good writer.
2232380	2240380	I would not want to get in a writing contest with her and she's 28 and I'm a genius and I'm old.
2240380	2243380	I would not say that about very few people.
2243380	2249880	Like I would now, it's intimidating because she makes choices that I would, would, would not be instinctive for me to make, which is what an important writer does.
2249880	2251880	I feel that way about Woody Allen.
2251880	2254880	I feel that way about like the writers that are really respect.
2254880	2266880	Like I, when I watch a Cohen brothers movie, when I went to like, she's a good writer and that I would easily before I would even touch all of this ridiculousness and this political fucking social psychological bullshit.
2266880	2273380	I will definitely easily in a court of law prove to you that she's a good writer or your money back.
2273380	2281380	And that is why I guess the elitist side of me is a little invoked when people gang up on her, particularly for things.
2281380	2296380	Because if you were a writer with a stutter, if you were a writer with a limp, if you were, you, you, you could, you, you're, you're the thing that made it harder for you to, to wake up in the morning.
2297380	2305880	Um, even though it would fuel your work and make it important to other people, it wouldn't also be like the thing that people could throw at you.
2305880	2314880	But for women writers in this modern world, it's like they're half the population and it's not a disability to be a woman and yet it gets thrown at you.
2315880	2324380	It's like, you can make people angry. This is becoming very clear to me. And I, three years ago, I wouldn't be having this conversation.
2324380	2329380	I wouldn't be feeling the way that I feel about this, but it's just like everything is coming to the surface.
2329380	2337380	You can just make people angry just by being a woman. You really can. It's fucking true.
2337380	2344380	And you can especially do it by doing that plus doing something like writing a television show.
2344380	2349880	Yeah. I was reading, I was reading this interview for the CEO of Yahoo. I forget her name.
2349880	2354880	I think it's Melissa Mir, Marissa Mir and the interviewer described in great detail what she was wearing.
2354880	2360880	Like that would never happen to a dude. Like all that stuff really, it's so insidious and you don't even think of it.
2360880	2367880	But every time there's an interview with a woman, it's about what kind of shoes she was wearing before talking about how she thinks, you know,
2367880	2379880	I was on Fox News on one of these shows and this, the piggy host of the show made this comment about one of the female Fox personalities that she wasn't showing as much skin as she normally does.
2379880	2382880	Me and Andrew W.K. was the other guests. We looked at her like Jesus.
2382880	2384380	I thought he was going to say Andrew Dice Clay.
2384380	2390380	No, no. He is more appropriate for their network. But so I looked at it. I go, that's fucking weird, right?
2390380	2401880	And we're like, yeah, what a creepy joke. But it wasn't a joke. She came back later, changed with more cleavage showing because it was a serious order that she was given by the host.
2401880	2410380	That laugh was laughing at something other than her misfortune. That's amazing. All right.
2410380	2421880	So done with that. I really seriously what I'm saying is Google the shit and like spend 30 minutes because it's kind of a study in history that's happening around you right now.
2421880	2432880	And I because I honestly as a 41 year old person with my full faculties and my ability to Google stuff, I went from hearing some shit to figuring out what the truth was.
2432880	2441380	And it took me an inordinately long time. And the truth is like, I mean, we just we'd have to do a whole podcast to talk about it.
2441380	2450380	But the bottom line is that is that is just it's there's aggression like toward people that people want that needs to be addressed.
2450380	2458880	There need the when you it's not science. It's not argument. It's not debate. This isn't like an ancient Rome like platformer.
2458880	2467880	It's like, well, is this logical or another thing? You're hot. You're it's not true. You hate you. You don't like something. You're angry.
2467880	2486380	And I think that I have felt that too. And I think I can understand it. But I think that it's like you have to look at moments of opportunity to to reverse or at least like let go of shit that is inexplicably driving you.
2486380	2493780	Because before you know it, you're like you're like passionate about something and it doesn't make any sense that you're passionate about it.
2493780	2505380	Like you're like you're like you're like yelling at somebody and you're using your your full IQ and all of your academic research to like wave a book in your hand and like yell at somebody about logic and flawed argument and all this stuff.
2505380	2514980	But it's like it doesn't matter anything you're saying. The whole reason why you went down that road with your book and with your IQ has to do with some weird moment with your mom in your kitchen.
2514980	2526980	I said it's just come come down to that, which is kind of exhilarating. And the aplomb with which she handles this like this this fucking like a 28 year old.
2526980	2536780	I hate fuck dude. I would be like, why do you like my bed? Fuck you. Like there was no like I couldn't even imagine being responsible for any kind of responsible opinions.
2536780	2545580	Yeah, I would have fled. I leaked a Chevy Chase voicemail and some Fletch fans called me an asshole and I almost killed myself.
2545580	2555580	I definitely almost left the country. I was a 40 year old white man that had never had any problems in his life.
2555580	2566580	Fletch is a pretty good move. It's great. It's great. It's great. The underhills. It's great. But I didn't do anything in front of his wife and kids. His kids are 50. All right.
2566580	2579180	There is children, Dan. They were babies 49 years ago. Sniffers Gotham. I got sold on Gotham. We don't have to talk about that.
2579180	2587380	That's like the nerd equivalent of Lena Dunwood conversation. Somebody sold me on Gotham. Did you have a run in with a sniffer recently that brings this up?
2588380	2598580	I sniffed some milk coming out of the fridge and I thought, isn't it a drag when you have to say that we have to sniff milk because it isn't sniffing a debasing horrible experience where you're like sniffing.
2598580	2607780	Yeah. But if you drink the shit milk you want, you want to have said, I mean, fuck it necessary. And that made me think of people who choose or maybe don't choose.
2607780	2612380	Maybe it's a compulsion. They live in a world of sniffing. They sniff shit. They don't have to sniff. That's what I thought of it.
2612380	2617380	Milk, you have to sniff. If you if you if you go down the road of having milk in your fridge too long, you got to sniff.
2617380	2631380	You got to sniff milk. But even if milk kids Google Lena Dunham, learn about misogyny and stop and start sniffing milk and stop sniffing everything else, even if it's good, milk smells horrible.
2631380	2641380	It's true. It's like it's always organic. You always know it's from an animal. What other animal are there grownups still drinking milk, let alone another fucking species milk?
2643380	2652380	None. It's just it's just us. We modified a gene to still drink milk after infancy. We're crazy people. Yeah.
2652380	2662380	Here's here's a continuation of my unsung heroes segment, which I started with Lena Dunham unsung heroes.
2662380	2670380	What was that? Lena Dunham is pretty sung as a hero. She's fine. What song was that? It's you drive me eight by the by the dickies.
2670380	2687380	Oh, right. All right. Hey, what's your favorite song of theirs, John? Oh, oh, probably sniffer. I think that's I think it's on their second EP, blog stompers or whatever.
2687380	2698380	Bog Trotter. I think I think Bog Trotter opened for Jeff Rotol on the 72 tour. Hey, you guys, what happened to Russell Brand? What happened to him, Dan?
2698380	2708380	I retweeted a thing that he said about how when he was poor and he complained about class, the class system, people called him. What? I can't remember what he said.
2708380	2719380	And then he had a quote that somebody tweeted to me because probably because it reminded them as a Harman John fan of things that I kind of express because I'm a I'm a privileged.
2719380	2728380	I've cheated the system. I live at the top. I'm not one percenter, but I'm I'm I fucking I got a guy that mows my lawn.
2728380	2736380	And so, you know, months back when I was, you know, I was like ranting a lot about capitalism. Remember that episode?
2736380	2743380	Sometimes the response is like, is like, fuck you. Don't you give all your money away then? And I was like, that's fucking horse shit.
2743380	2749380	Like what? The fact that I respond to any system, like if you didn't like comedies when you were in the party, be like, well, then give your power to some other dude.
2749380	2757380	That's pretty convenient response to criticizing a system. You go fuck off. All right. How does that solve anything?
2758380	2765380	And somebody sent me a quote that he had in some somewhere that said that I immediately retweeted because I was like, oh, yeah, exactly.
2765380	2780380	It was like and I can't remember it exactly. It was like when I was when I was poor and I talked about class, people called me a hater, bitter, bitter, bitter, a hater.
2780380	2786380	They told me I was taking too much hater aid. When I was when I was poor and I talked about class, they called me a hater.
2786380	2794380	When I was rich and I talked about class, they called me a hypocrite hypocrite. Right. And it's like I'm getting the feeling nobody wants to talk about class.
2794380	2802380	And I retweeted it. And and, you know, I have two hundred fifty thousand followers. They're all pretty what.
2802380	2806380	Yeah, no, that's okay. Thank you.
2806380	2813380	So this isn't even a sample size from the this isn't a sample from the ocean of humanity. This is a sample from my Twitter followers.
2813380	2824380	Overwhelmingly, just a you know, 10 or 20 people just kind of just just responding back to go like, I think maybe it's possible they don't want to hear from fucking Russell Brand.
2824380	2827380	And just like I get it. Like, you don't have to like like I.
2827380	2836380	The weird thing is like I spent all of the time up until his disappearance from the earth, which which is what my question is about.
2836380	2842380	Yeah. Going, why is he popular? I like get him into the Greek. I think it's a funny movie. I haven't seen it. It's a good movie.
2842380	2850380	It's got a really nice Hollywood mainstream structure. There's where did he go? Is he now blacklisted? Is he he wrote a book?
2850380	2858380	OK, he had a few movies in a row that didn't do well here. And I think he went back. So it wasn't because he didn't.
2858380	2868380	It wasn't because that's what happened. That's what I'm terrified as he. Sorry, didn't work out.
2868380	2876380	I met him once and like it was at a dinner with him and he was incredibly charming. He was very smart and very funny and very eloquent.
2876380	2886380	But also he's a his shirt had buttons on it, but he wasn't using any of them. He was it was completely like a Robert Plantish sort of thing.
2886380	2895380	It was like maybe that maybe the button that was so low, like it was below his belt, it didn't even need to be buttoned because it was it was he was more or less shirtless the whole time.
2895380	2901380	And when he talks, he talked to me and he talked to women like he was just very he tried to put on his right now.
2902380	2912380	It's chest to chest, nipple to nipple with Russell Brand. And he makes you feel very wanted. I think for me, that's what's for sale.
2912380	2919380	He kind of makes you feel like you're about to get maybe made out with by by by a next heroin user. It's very exciting.
2920380	2935380	Built in spring loaded mechanism by which anyone who lives a privileged lifestyle, like an actor who happens to be a celebrity, who should be so thankful for the lifestyle, they've been granted by the government slash people slash people magazine slash government magazine.
2936380	2948380	There are instincts to clamp down on their necks until they're dead the minute they talk about anything other than red carpets and what they're wearing bought off.
2948380	2953380	The idea is that you thought you're famous. All right. Why don't you shut the fuck up?
2953380	2964380	Yeah, I get like stick to your jokes so many times on Twitter. If I say anything that's like a some sort of opinion of political or anything, I think it's so many times.
2964380	2971380	I think it's fine. I don't want to if Bruce Willis got on Twitter and was like, hey, you know, six million. It's a pretty high number.
2971380	2978380	You know, I think it's fine to say to him what you're in fucking die hard. Why are you a revisionist?
2978380	2993380	Got it. That number has been nine eleven, by the way, huh? Whenever you think of six million. Yeah, you can't be like certain numbers are ruined.
2994380	3000380	Thanks a lot. Yeah. Way to go, Germany. You ruin the number six million for everybody.
3000380	3007380	So if you're going to get paid six million, could you just pay me five million nine hundred and ninety thousand? I just feel more comfortable, I think, with that number on the track.
3007380	3010380	It's like the thirteenth floor of a hotel. Yeah, you can stop using it at all.
3010380	3018380	Just eliminate it. It's fine. As a consumer, you have the right to say, I enjoy Liam Neeson fighting wolves.
3018380	3024380	I do not enjoy Liam Neeson's opinion about breast cancer. You have a right to buy anything you want.
3024380	3027380	But you don't have a right to tell them to shut up about that.
3027380	3041380	Well, you do have a right to tell them to shut up. But what I am saying is our instinct to do so collectively is I'm telling you like when you do that, whose side are you on?
3041380	3053380	You are on the side of all like I just keep saying like when you when you when you when you tell someone to shut up, when you tell someone that they should be less ambitious, when you tell someone that they should be less ignorant.
3053380	3065380	Like ignorance, a hugely important thing in all life. It is the thing that happens before knowing things. Yeah. It's different from intolerance. Ignorance.
3065380	3075380	Ignorance when you meet someone who just doesn't know something yet. The way you're going to find out that they don't know it yet is by their big fucking flappy mouth.
3075380	3087380	When we discourage that, which is what kittens are doing when they're attacking a paper ball on the floor, you don't tell the kitten, that's not a dog. Knock it off.
3087380	3093380	You can't eat that. Get in your kitten hole. Be a more efficient kitten.
3094380	3103380	We love experimentation and play. It is vital to us as a species. When we discourage it, we are.
3103380	3116380	Can we not just realize that you if you look to if you if you when you're saying something to someone, if it's not something that Snickers would disagree with. Big Snickers. Big Snickers.
3117380	3130380	You can still say it because maybe Snickers isn't wrong about everything. But are you a hero? What do you think Liam Neeson's stance on breast cancer is, Dan? Controversially enough, it doesn't matter.
3132380	3144380	No, it does, Liam. I know he has a horrible controversial PSA. It doesn't matter if you have breast cancer. It doesn't matter if it's the number one killer of women. Wolves matter.
3145380	3154380	He's he's going somewhere as a conceit with that. They just stop there. Like, it doesn't matter. Cancerous breasts don't have cubs. They can't kill you with their teeth.
3154380	3165380	Do you think that Liam Neeson was into wolves before that movie or the movie was made around? I think he called him. I think he saw it. I think it was starring like Tom Green or something.
3165380	3168380	It was going to go a whole different way with wacky wolves.
3168380	3178380	From how that movie goes, I think it was a comedy. It was like Rob Schneider can't get a break. When Rob Schneider beats these four wolves, they've got a wolf.
3178380	3192380	I think the wolves probably talked in a lot of the scenes. Like, hey, Rob, you know we're going to kill you in act two. No. And then it's like, I have Liam Neeson on line one. What? I'm very passionate about the movie you're making.
3193380	3207380	The Wolf movie? The Rob Schneider movie? I spent time with my daughter at the Botanical Gardens. Wait, go on. How did wolves tie into the Botanical Gardens?
3207380	3216380	The Botanical Gardens are the one type of garden wolves shouldn't be in. Exactly. And the last thing that would remind you of the snow.
3217380	3227380	I also like that the people making the movie are calling it that wolves movie. So dismissive. And that they're ready to drop Schneider and the comedic tone in a fuck one phone call.
3227380	3240380	They've got eight things without. All right, so Rob Schneider and... Can Rob Schneider talk about his opinions? Sure, everybody can.
3241380	3265380	We do a podcast and all we do is mouth off about our stupid opinions about everything. So we can't really say anything. But I think it is really dumb to expect celebrities for their opinions to weigh anything at all. Once in a while, there will be a celebrity who is thoughtful and intelligent and will say something that actually means something. But who gives a fuck what Kevin Bacon thinks? That shouldn't matter on the face of that face value. It's crazy.
3266380	3275380	Charles Barkley said something about how he was like a racial profiling isn't bad for cops. And it's like, who the fuck cares what Charles Barkley thinks about?
3275380	3281380	Also, you can't be profiled if you're more famous than the type that you look like. Oh, is that? Oh, it's Charles Barkley. I know exactly who that is.
3281380	3284380	Yeah, he doesn't have to deal with that. He looks like Charles Barkley.
3284380	3287380	Yeah, he's like, I'm a black man and everyone's nice to me.
3287380	3298380	The first thought isn't black man. It's oh, Charles Barkley, the famous NBA star. I've seen him more than I've seen any black man here on TV.
3298380	3310380	I met Charles Barkley in Portland after doing a show in time and we were all going to get the bar closed down. And he just started telling me stories about being best friends with Michael Jordan. And it was like the coolest night. He was just like, he's fucking hilarious.
3310380	3319380	How did Jordan come off? Jordan comes off like a guy that, you know, like a nice guy, gambling problem. And so he's like, he's like, he's like, Jeff.
3319380	3330380	You met Michael Jordan? No, I met Charles Barkley who talked about being best friends with Michael Jordan. Charles Barkley tells stories about being friends with Michael Jordan, which is, which is the Michael Jordan stories.
3331380	3346380	Even he's namedropped. He could tell a story about just himself and it would be namedropped. But the no ring club drops the ring club. I mean, like that's the only long crowd buddy. They don't know about rings.
3347380	3370380	But these five, these five blonde women came into the bar and they were all local news anchors. They're all the women that worked in the local news channel in Portland, apparently. And he's like, as I said, Jeff, apparently we were best friends now because I was sitting next to him and he's like, he's like, we got to go to another bar after this. I go, there's a bar right on the corner. That's that's open a little after this. He's like, you realize you and I have to fuck some of these women.
3370380	3390380	I'm like, aren't you married? He's like, yeah, Barkley married. He's a little tall. He's a big, he's a big fucker. He's like, he's huge. I could get inside him like a costume.
3391380	3400380	Like a tauntaun. Yeah, exactly. I got to cut open Charles Barkley. I thought Charles Barkley's so bad on the other side.
3403380	3419380	So I go, okay, this is barred. So he invites these girls to the bar. I go, it's just like, we can walk there. It's like two blocks away. He's like, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, we're not walking anywhere, baby. I got the van. And sure enough, a fucking a team, a fucking mystery machine, fucking full on windowless white van.
3421380	3431380	Glamorizing John Wayne Casey. Yeah, man. I got the, I got the wagon, man. Are you going to take these teenage boys home and show them the rope trick?
3432380	3445380	He's a welder. I got the crawl space, man. We don't have to. We don't have to deal with this. I got the crawl space, baby. You know, you and I have to eat some of these children.
3446380	3450380	We are his deep in human lampshade right now.
3451380	3461380	No, fucking a full on a team black van that with a sliding door, like an old school fucking like I was like a Ford O'Connell line pulled up with like a, I maybe I'm mythologizing. I think it has.
3462380	3466380	Well, I'd love to see like security footage of this and it's not Charles Barkley.
3467380	3491380	It's just some dude. It's Jeff in a broom. Yeah, he was, he was just Barkley profiling a broom. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. He sounded just like him, you guys. Yeah. The five newscasters are just like three cats. He was certainly a large black man. He was a large black man. It might as well have been Charles Barkley.
3492380	3495380	What is the team of the six blonde newscaster women?
3496380	3502380	Maybe you just gave a random dude courage enough to fuck these women because he thought he was Charles Barkley for a second.
3503380	3513380	Whether it was Charles Barkley or not, I got Charles Barkley laid that night because all he wanted was a wingman. So like, you know, Drew Carey's there. We're all hanging out. The only reason that he was there.
3513380	3531380	Where did you go? Like planted Hollywood in the, in the dream of the people who founded it. Like where was this place? There was a colorized John Wayne. Get on some of this pussy. This Star Wars band with the big heads.
3532380	3534380	Gene Kelly dances.
3537380	3540380	We're going to fuck some of these pilgrims.
3543380	3549380	Russell Brand not there. He dropped off the face of the earth. There's no more. It was a gaucho grill in Portland, Oregon.
3550380	3563380	And that's the end. But so we get the, so I was like, we can, we can walk. There's like, no, we're not walking anywhere, baby. I got the van and he puts his arm around me in a, in a very like dominating fashion. Like headlocks me. He's like, he's like, you're rolling with me tonight, Jeff.
3564380	3565380	Like training day.
3565380	3584380	So we get to the bar. I go, sir Charles, can I get you a drink? He's like, give me like a triple vodka cranberry. Something awesome. Like he ordered a triple because he's huge. And so I go to the bar. He goes and meets these girls and instantly leaves with them.
3585380	3601380	He's gone. He goes up there. No, we're there for a minute. And then we're up there hanging out and I go up to go to the bathroom. He's like, Jeff, baby, baby. You're not leaving, baby. You're not leaving. You're not leaving. I go, I'm just going to go to the bathroom. Charles Barkley. I'll be right back. And then I came back. And then when I came back, he was gone. He just took all the girls and left.
3602380	3608380	Charles Barkley pickup line book is like, Hey, I'm Charles Barkley at the end. That's the book. Like once you say that, like, well, he got me in a van.
3609380	3626380	I do like the idea of him, like, going back to his race stuff, like thinking that his experiences, like, Oh, things are much easier for black people. As soon as I joined the Phoenix.
3626380	3654380	Everything is equal now. That's his advice to be able to join the sons and be a star for them. I don't know. You have to be Charles Barkley because he's kind of adorable. And he's funny. Jason Kidd is seems like an asshole. He was in the sons, too. No one likes that guy. Well, he also had some spice to the abuse stuff. You know, he's got stuff. It's still sports talk, even if there's child abuse involved. You're still talking about sports. Sorry, deal breaker.
3655380	3659380	All right, I want to I want to I want to go into our heartbreaker segment.
3662380	3683380	Is that more Dickey's? It's still Dickey's. So it's just the same thing, but we advance. Do you want different music? Because we have. No, that's good. That's good. We have to use up my music before we have to change everything. This is a heartbreaker that I want to do. Our old friend, our friend of the show, seek Donnelly, who I tweeted. He was he was here one night. He had a massive eruption of
3684380	3713380	bullshit in his brain. I think that's the medical term. It wasn't an aneurysm. We'll let him describe it for a second. But actually, I think if I just bottle through the explanation, I he he came back. Now I'm stuttering while I'm describing it. He came back into the green room. And his stutter was like, like, because it had hit his verbal center. And I was I thought about bringing him up that night. But I'm telling you, it was just like, too. It was like, it's too frustrating.
3714380	3733380	For him to talk. We've been tracking this guy's adventures since since we met him. And and then was that night. And I tweeted like, oh, my God, he's all this thing happened. And he's he's pretty fucked up. But he's he's here tonight. And he's he's he's going to go to see his mom for Christmas as a seeker. You hear? Can you can you come up?
3733380	3760380	I wanted to touch base with you and send you off for the holidays because so many people were so concerned about you when I tweeted that stuff because it was a tragedy. But you talk now you sound better.
3761380	3786380	Thank you. I want to say thanks that everyone came. I'm now nervous. But everyone who wrote based off your tweet. Yeah. And said nice things to me. I I don't I didn't know I had such an impact on people. It was a it was an eye opener for me. I think I knew that when we talked about the Kickstarter and saw everyone fund it in a day.
3787380	3807380	And that was the first time it really clicked with me. But then to see a lot of people respond on Reddit and and on Twitter and write me personal messages. It just I I just want to say being a Armenian has been like the best thing ever. And you guys are all really awesome people.
3808380	3828380	Yeah. There's like a crazy thing that you said to me in the green room because the first time we met you the first conversation we had with you on stage we talked about the tragedy which I think I remember like Aaron was like crying because they're like like she heard it for the first time on stage that you're when you had your to catch you up.
3828380	3845380	Iron Man 3 the Sikh Sikh for whatever reason he's a medical phenomenon has had multiple aneurysms and has survived them but has no guarantee that he won't continue to have them and has gone through experimental treatment at the hands of these people.
3845380	3863380	And then there was an episode where he said to us that he told these people who had been experimentally treating his aneurysms which had had some results but that ultimately there was a point where you said for better or for worse I am ending this chapter.
3863380	3887380	I'm going forward into a world without this particular treatment where they put these coils in and stuff like that and then you and then you went off and we were like okay Godspeed what's going to happen now because it because as you said like as you were off the treatment like your memories are starting to happen and your visual centers are starting to light up this this tragedy that happened to you recently was actually one of these coils blue.
3888380	3911380	Yeah no the the cold one of the coils which is rare that this would happen slid out and punctured another piece of my brain and it it was a Sunday night and I was I remember waking up screaming and and was taken to the to the ER and they weren't my normal doctor.
3911380	3934380	So they did a CT scan MRI didn't find anything but I knew something was wrong so I kept screaming about pain and then I left for to go to a comic book signing in Arizona while in pain the show was going to be at pretty much because they kept telling me nothing was wrong and sometimes I have things that are psychological.
3934380	3955380	So I go okay maybe this is one of those things I'm not in pain and then I came back the next day from Arizona and couldn't talk almost at all and then I felt trapped because that happened to me when my the first aneurysm ruptured and I've had nine cents and luckily none ruptured.
3956380	3978380	So so the coil slid out of the ninth one and it punctured a piece of my brain and my brain my brain bled for five days until I went back to the doctor on and saw my doctor a second time and they found the problem but at that point it was too late the damage was done the bleeding stopped but on its own.
3978380	4000380	Luckily because it wasn't a lot but just enough to to to to build a or I guess break a levy or something but the good news is that like like you mean you when you came up when you came to the green room that night to do an impression of it like like because it sounds like it was like like you were going.
4000380	4029380	Like you couldn't you couldn't say a single word without eight yeah it was frustrating for me it was it must be like trapped in a being trapped in a coffin yeah it was yeah I mean yeah it was to me it was awful I mean and I met I mean I feel weird complaining about it because I when I go to the hospital to deal with these things I meet people who are way worse and I'm part of aneurysm groups where people are way worse.
4030380	4048380	So I I try to let that keep me grounded of how much I complain about it you know you look I mean listen to us so much perspective we take so much for granted I was complaining about people telling me on Twitter to like stick to my jokes.
4048380	4059380	That's fine though that's all real this is the worst problem anyone's ever had that was me yeah.
4059380	4072380	I don't think I don't think that that's the key to life I don't think that I don't think that the key to life is all of us figuring out how that we should be using a metric by which every day we wake up in bed if we don't have every.
4072380	4086380	And I'm not saying that I'm not saying that what I'm saying is having perspective for me is it really helps those very and you get like you see the big picture and just because you know people are starving in Africa doesn't mean you can't get pissed about being stuck in a traffic jam.
4086380	4090380	I'm not saying that especially of a starving African child cuts you off.
4091380	4093380	Oh yeah.
4093380	4095380	Which I forgot to talk about.
4095380	4097380	That is number one on my list of shit.
4097380	4102380	Yeah I'm like why are you starving just sell the car.
4102380	4104380	It's a fucking hummer.
4105380	4122380	But I think for obviously we all have problems and relative to us those are big problems but to hear you talk about some of the issues you've had and then to hear you say that you don't think those issues are as major as what someone else has like that's very inspiring.
4122380	4125380	And it's just good to have.
4125380	4127380	Sorry.
4127380	4131380	Your memory is still the same or are you making memories again or no.
4131380	4138380	I mean I'm going to see my mom and so I haven't seen her in a couple of years. This is the good news that I want to talk about. OK.
4138380	4141380	But I own this. I own this.
4141380	4144380	This is all from Dan.
4144380	4151380	I my my mom we kind of grew apart when I didn't have any memories of her.
4151380	4154380	So she didn't know how to handle that.
4154380	4156380	And I don't blame her.
4156380	4160380	And you literally had no like no old memories no childhood memories nothing.
4160380	4164380	No I mean I don't. I didn't get visual.
4164380	4170380	You know so. So I could kind of know that she was my mom but I felt it.
4170380	4173380	But you don't conjure up any visual attachments.
4173380	4180380	But now I can. And I mean I know what N.T. looks like and Adam Goldberg looks like.
4180380	4183380	There's pros and cons to everything.
4187380	4189380	I only know what he sounds like.
4192380	4195380	Oh wait. Oh I know you now. OK. All right.
4199380	4200380	Shut the fuck up.
4200380	4201380	Yeah.
4212380	4216380	Goldberg had like an achievement on lock things so.
4216380	4218380	He gets the green lightsaber.
4220380	4223380	Easy shot. Easy shot.
4223380	4232380	So some of my mom my mom she just she's happy that we you know I'm a big Superman fan big Star Wars fan.
4232380	4237380	So my my mom is we had this connection recently where she said do you.
4237380	4243380	I said Mom I remember you and I used to drive her like whenever she had extra money on it.
4243380	4246380	We grew up poor like we're we're both still poor my mom and I.
4246380	4252380	And she was like do you remember driving around looking for Star Wars figures like two different toy stores
4252380	4259380	and trying to find like the R2D2 that like was the rare figure in the set or the slave layout variant or whatever.
4259380	4264380	And and so we recently had been buying Star Wars figures together like me on the east.
4264380	4270380	They hear West Coast and her on the East Coast and it kind of rebuilt this like connection with us.
4270380	4275380	And and so she'll send me pictures of the stuff she's buying which are waiting for me when I go home.
4275380	4280380	And I've been Instagramming them like look at the toy my mom found me and it kind of gave my Instagram a purpose
4280380	4283380	besides like pictures of my dog.
4283380	4286380	So it's so it's been it's been kind of nice.
4286380	4290380	And so now we I have almost every memory of her I think.
4290380	4292380	And it's so it's been coming back to you.
4292380	4296380	You said like you you're you're and I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing.
4296380	4300380	I don't know if it should be celebrated like Reese Witherspoon seeing things in color and Pleasantville.
4300380	4304380	The you are in a sleepless state.
4304380	4306380	You can't sleep right now.
4306380	4310380	Your brain is exploding with that's bad.
4310380	4311380	Idiom idiom.
4311380	4316380	Your your mind is exploding with with with you.
4316380	4320380	You don't you can't tell the difference between dreams and memories right now.
4320380	4322380	Yeah because it's so overwhelming.
4322380	4326380	Like I like my neighbor who like is a really good friend of mine.
4326380	4331380	And she I can now close my eyes and I know and I can see what she looks like.
4331380	4332380	She's not even in the room.
4332380	4335380	Whereas before someone had to describe an apple and you would like.
4335380	4338380	And we can't even comprehend it because we're we're trying to figure out what that even meant before.
4338380	4343380	We were like learning to draw because you were an artist lost your visual memory and you had to like you couldn't see that.
4343380	4345380	Now you can't not see things.
4345380	4346380	Now you close your eyes.
4346380	4353380	And it's it's pretty horrifying because because I've been remembering things that aren't good things either.
4353380	4360380	You know like I I I'm I mean I never thought I I don't know.
4360380	4362380	I never thought I was a good person.
4362380	4365380	Like I grew up pretty broken abusive dad.
4365380	4370380	You know like poor ran away from home got into drugs.
4370380	4371380	I was a narc.
4371380	4374380	Like I mean I've done like really crazy things.
4374380	4375380	Wow.
4375380	4377380	And you were a narc.
4377380	4378380	Yeah.
4378380	4379380	In Atlanta.
4379380	4382380	This is turning into memento.
4382380	4384380	Like the one that is going to come back.
4384380	4385380	The money.
4385380	4389380	Like it's buried in Central Park.
4389380	4390380	Oh wait.
4390380	4392380	I was undercover.
4392380	4393380	That's who that guy is.
4393380	4394380	Oh my God.
4394380	4397380	He's been following me for a year.
4397380	4399380	Yeah.
4399380	4410380	So I but I remember when you when you forget your life it's easy to reset and be a good person because I feel like deep down we all want to be good people.
4410380	4412380	And so it was easy for me.
4412380	4419380	But now it's I I am like I people don't you know like I don't go out as much anymore.
4419380	4427380	I stay recluse in my apartment because I'm afraid because I start remembering all these things and I'm like well will that guy ever come back.
4427380	4433380	You know or now that he now that I know or am I smart enough now I've done enough good now I've given more than I've taken.
4433380	4436380	Like did I am I OK.
4436380	4437380	Am I in the clear you know.
4437380	4448380	So I so I've been struggling a lot lately and it's brought me in and out of depression and brought me you know a lot of places emotionally I couldn't go before because I had emotional problems.
4448380	4454380	So now like as far as you know knowing when to be sad and when the right time to be sad I had issues with that.
4454380	4457380	Now I know when to cry I know when to be upset.
4457380	4462380	And so to know that and to know like the good and bad things you've done in your life.
4462380	4471380	And to know that there are people out there that have kept like those things like private you know like I just like it's like a lot to digest.
4471380	4488380	So do you think that people should always be transparent about every scrap of darkness inside of them or do you think it's important for us to hold on to the things protect them guard them have shameful things that we I mean I don't I don't know.
4488380	4493380	It's that's a good question. I think it's I think it's case by case.
4493380	4508380	I think I think like for me I I probably won't share some of those things but I will try to make amends with someone who I think I've wronged on a personal level and secretly with them and just hope that's enough.
4508380	4520380	And and I will you know I mean yeah it's I think it's just case by case me I've lived these past five years you know I'll be in I'll be 33 in May next year.
4520380	4528380	So be my essentially my fifth birthday and out of this new life and I I want to keep going with this new life.
4528380	4537380	I want to look at the mistakes I've made and I think that's everyone everyone who's made a mistake they can just you look at it you dissect it every morning you wake up you have this new chance.
4537380	4549380	It's kind of like a crassly like force that weld to all this stuff that we were talking about with the online culture but it's like you do have an opportunity every morning you wake up to kind of change.
4549380	4566380	You could just go you know what I may I may not be reacting with sure like regular shit I thought I thought my what I thought was my neutral gear actually is like a weird gear that was like handed to me by somebody above me.
4567380	4580380	Or my past and actually there is a true neutral and you can just achieve it that that's a I don't I well I'm not a doctor but I doubt that you'll be overtaken in your wildest dreams that would happen.
4580380	4589380	I think we would love to have evil seek back you come come back and tell us how women shouldn't vote.
4590380	4596380	I remember now Superman this is for faggots.
4599380	4613380	I think we would think the crazy thing is those seriously like there would be a huge lesson too because we could we could I think I think all of the women and faggots in this audience could like watch you bound out like the Hulk and go I love that guy.
4614380	4617380	I'm glad he's back. I'm glad he didn't.
4618380	4631380	It's a cool opportunity in a way I mean I mean obviously you want to be able to have all your memories back but to to be able to say something like I don't like I get to choose right now whether I am a good person or I or do I dwell on the bad things that I did.
4631380	4637380	And that's we should all wake up tomorrow morning and say fuck all the bad shit I did. Let's just start being good from here forward.
4638380	4651380	And like and absolutely just hit control alternate delete and reset everything and walk forward and don't feel ashamed of all the things that you've done me certainly you want to go back and make amends for wrongs you've done people.
4651380	4654380	Sure. But I think you'd find that that's probably a very small part of you.
4655380	4677380	And you also find that people are forgiving. I learned that you know pretty recently and I think I think I wake up every morning with the question of like like like because I like I said I'm part of aneurysm groups I meet other people I go to hospitals and and and was at one point part of a like a monthly group that we met.
4678380	4690380	And I see that I'm I'm doing much better than a lot of people and other people are doing better than me too but so I wake up every day going what what can I do that they can't that but should be done.
4690380	4701380	You know like what can I do for them to help spread a message or help you know do something good light a fire under somebody who needs inspiration you know like how can I give.
4702380	4719380	And I think if we wake up every day with that I think I mean I think then we will stop giving a shit about people like what is you know Kevin Costner think about this or you know who cares what Christian Bale is thinks about the new Batman like who gives a shit that's not news like there's a new Batman what to do there's a new Batman every five years.
4720380	4722380	I'll be Batman in five years.
4722380	4751380	Also the fact that you just spoke for a couple minutes without stuttering a single time in a while and just recently you couldn't talk it's amazing and that's the miracle of our podcast and you at home if you're watching we need your money unless you want seek on other people to continue to suffer sign the back of your social security check and mail it into harm in town.
4752380	4768380	I have a question sorry I was going to ask you how I don't know how brains work how is your how are your memories coming back it's interesting that it was in there wasn't that it was gone it just you couldn't access it do you know how it's all I mean.
4768380	4797380	Stuff heals over time especially the mind and so sometimes it's it's it's not like one set spot where everything is in your brain it's different for everyone so it's I that's why I think like I don't know I admit this is I don't want to get too out there with this but I I I look at a very good blend of the supernatural and the scientific you know like I feel like I'm surrounded by that a lot because I feel like I've dodged more bullets and I I will.
4798380	4827380	I would have if I was a god in charge I would have given me so just just to be clear would you mean like when the tissue is damaged yeah the memories that that tissue was responsible for go offline but when the tissue heals then those memories like reappear in the hard drive no not in every case okay but in some cases mine it seems where it was damaged it was just the link going to okay was the damage part so now when things kind of rewire and rewire around the damage.
4827380	4845380	Things start coming together it's not a real thing it's it's it's it's it's these ideas are stored somewhere in this lump of toothpaste we have on our head that's some of the I mean I'm not allowed to talk about most of it but some of the research stuff I've been part of is is that kind of stuff it's asking me.
4845380	4867380	It's asking me spoilers is Will Smith doing the research hey spoilers research doesn't come out front of the four years they're giving them scanners powers man you can't talk about this shit anyone's allowed to talk about anything I signed like you know a lot of documents but you can just say you didn't remember that and they'll have to buy it.
4867380	4875380	They're going to sue you you have the best excuse for anything.
4875380	4883380	That was evil seek.
4883380	4894380	We are I want to I want to I want to get my wife and my dungeon master out here pretty quickly but seek what what is there anything else you want to say before you go out for the holidays.
4894380	4902380	I mean I know my boss would love me to plug something but instead I'd rather everyone here just do something nice for somebody for the holidays.
4902380	4910380	Give to Ferrell audio if you can donate give to brain aneurysm foundation or the Joe Negro foundation to the brain aneurysm we're okay.

5090380	5091380	Nothing's on my mind.
5091380	5093380	Just you guys are hating on Russell Brand just because he's trying to make a political
5093380	5094380	difference.
5094380	5096380	I said he was sexy and didn't button his shirt.
5096380	5098380	I said the movie was good.

5107380	5108380	Me and Russ.
5109380	5110380	Rusty.
5110380	5111380	Saying he's falling off.

5112380	5113380	I call him Rusty.
5113380	5114380	Rusty Rockets.
5114380	5118380	I was suspicious that he was being targeted and punished by.

5121380	5122380	You know.
5122380	5123380	You don't listen in the back.

5124380	5125380	Repeating words you've heard tonight.
5125380	5128380	Lena Dunham's dog bites people.
5128380	5130380	He's not okay.
5130380	5131380	It's not okay.
5131380	5135380	He's getting his memories back one at a time but just from 20 minutes ago.
5135380	5136380	It's not.
5136380	5137380	Well I'm.
5137380	5138380	Yeah.
5138380	5139380	I have to catch up.
5139380	5140380	Russell Brand target.
5140380	5141380	You know those aisle.
5141380	5142380	Those those shelves.
5142380	5146380	In California they bolt him down because of earthquakes.
5146380	5148380	And this guy can kill your character at any time.
5148380	5149380	Yeah.
5149380	5150380	What character?
5150380	5151380	He's.
5151380	5152380	We're already dead.
5152380	5154380	They bolt him down because of earthquakes.
5154380	5155380	How do you know that?
5155380	5161380	Well I mean they bolted the ones at borders down and those are the same concept you know
5161380	5164380	shelves with product on them.
5165380	5166380	Did you.
5166380	5167380	It's a building code thing.
5167380	5168380	Did you work at borders.
5168380	5169380	Yeah.
5169380	5170380	Yeah.
5170380	5171380	Yeah.
5171380	5172380	We knew all about.
5172380	5173380	Yeah.
5173380	5175380	You know bookshelves are just borders.
5175380	5177380	You've got a real.
5177380	5178380	With books on them.
5178380	5180380	You've got a real Andy Rooney.
5180380	5181380	Do you.
5181380	5182380	I don't know.
5182380	5183380	Who's Andy Rooney.
5183380	5184380	I.
5184380	5186380	Who's Andy Rooney.
5186380	5190380	Who's this Andy Rooney I keep hearing about.
5190380	5197380	Seems like every time I turn on a podcast that has someone over 30 on it they're referencing
5197380	5198380	Amy Rooney.
5198380	5199380	Is that a genius.
5199380	5203380	I take exception at a reference I don't understand.
5203380	5208380	I'd like people to reference things I do understand.
5208380	5211380	What's with soap.
5211380	5215380	How small does it have to get.
5215380	5220380	Andy Rooney was a guy in 60 Minutes who would basically do one of those brilliant pieces
5220380	5226380	I ever saw in spy magazine existed is they created a column that was a on one side it
5226380	5230380	was Andy Rooney comments and on the other side it was Jerry Seinfeld bits.
5230380	5233380	And you had to figure out who was who.
5233380	5235380	And it was it was tough.
5235380	5236380	It's tough.
5236380	5239380	Well Rudy just would do the premises within there wouldn't be any jokes after that.
5239380	5242380	It would just be like what's the deal and then then he would just keep saying that in
5242380	5243380	different ways.
5243380	5244380	You'd be surprised though.
5244380	5245380	Did he get some good lines.
5245380	5250380	No no I'm saying you'd be surprised at how little bit you let Jerry Seinfeld get away
5250380	5251380	with.
5251380	5252380	I think the point of that column.
5252380	5256380	The point of that column wasn't look how funny Andy Rooney is.
5256380	5262380	It's not like it's not like after Seinfeld asks the question where's the sock in the
5262380	5263380	dryer.
5263380	5268380	He lands the fucking he doesn't like put on a Darth Vader mask and do a thing where I
5268380	5269380	found the sock.
5269380	5272380	He asked the question and that's what Andy Rudy does.
5272380	5273380	Where'd the sock go.
5273380	5274380	Where's it go.
5274380	5278380	Who wears sweaters.
5278380	5279380	The end.
5279380	5282380	Did you guys know that you can measure the passage of time by how many of Dan's buttons
5282380	5285380	are on buttons.
5285380	5288380	Oh you're you're Russell Branding.
5288380	5290380	You're Russell Branding.
5290380	5291380	You're branding bro.
5291380	5292380	You're branding.
5292380	5293380	You're fucking branding bro.
5293380	5295380	I'm splitting like a.
5295380	5296380	You're three down to Russell.
5296380	5297380	Like three is the last.
5297380	5302380	I'm like a tamale.
5302380	5307380	Dan did you unbutton those or does your navel prehensile.
5307380	5308380	How did that happen.
5308380	5310380	I mean I assume that they were kind of.
5310380	5312380	I assume that I'm fat.
5312380	5314380	No but that's not how buttons work.
5314380	5317380	They will pop off before they'll just unbutton themselves.
5317380	5321380	I think I think they will before they before they pop off they'll unbutton.
5321380	5322380	You think so.
5322380	5324380	Yeah that's the I think.
5324380	5325380	I restart the pot.
5325380	5327380	Not on myth busters.
5327380	5329380	What do buttons really do.
5329380	5331380	Get them open again.
5331380	5332380	Try your hardest.
5332380	5334380	Do it.
5334380	5337380	You can do it.
5337380	5343380	By the way that is doing things I didn't think it could do.
5343380	5344380	That.
5344380	5346380	Oh my god.
5346380	5348380	Holy shit.
5348380	5354380	I want to open it and there's another like Dan face on it.
5354380	5358380	This is a really good commercial for subscribing to the video feed.
5358380	5359380	Oh yeah.
5359380	5366380	If you're if you're listening right now you're listening later than this is happening and you didn't get to see what I just did.
5366380	5367380	Let's play some.
5367380	5369380	I've been away for a very long time.
5369380	5371380	We play a little D&D please.
5371380	5372380	I don't know.
5372380	5375380	Apparently I found that terrible things happened to my character.
5375380	5376380	So yeah.
5376380	5377380	So many.
5377380	5378380	What are we doing.
5378380	5379380	D&D Spencer.
5379380	5380380	Hold on.
5380380	5384380	It's a game where you roll dice and we portray character.
5384380	5385380	Oh great.
5385380	5387380	Can you teach us all how to play.
5388380	5391380	Oh fuck Spencer.
5391380	5394380	Hey fucking.
5394380	5395380	Wow.
5395380	5396380	Yeah.
5396380	5398380	This you missed a lot Jeff.
5398380	5399380	You missed a lot.
5399380	5401380	Don't be angry with me man.
5401380	5408380	I grew three more testicles for a total of nine.
5408380	5412380	Well while Spencer is setting up can I briefly also say something about Target.
5412380	5413380	Yeah.
5413380	5414380	Yes.
5414380	5415380	Yes.
5415380	5416380	Thank you.
5416380	5417380	I said no.
5417380	5420380	You may speak woman.
5420380	5421380	Tell us about Lena Dunham.
5421380	5422380	Thank you.
5422380	5425380	Well one day I took my vagina into Target.
5425380	5430380	A couple years ago I was at the Target on Sunset in Hollywood and I was walking around
5430380	5434380	and I was wearing a red shirt and I don't know if this is still the policy but I think
5434380	5439380	the employees can just wear any old red shirt as long as it doesn't have anything on it.
5439380	5440380	Scoot it.
5440380	5441380	Is that correct?
5441380	5442380	Store to store.
5442380	5443380	Store to store.
5443380	5444380	Oh cool.
5444380	5445380	Store to store.
5445380	5446380	Interesting.
5446380	5448380	So you're saying at a pea fresh you couldn't.
5448380	5452380	Hey this really is the best company ever.
5452380	5455380	You mean I could wear a red shirt of any kind?
5455380	5458380	No matter where I go.
5458380	5463380	So I was walking around I was in the automotive section and I was like in a hurry trying to
5463380	5467380	find something and this guy walked up to me and he was like hey hey hey can you tell me
5467380	5469380	where the blah blah blah is?
5469380	5471380	And I said oh I'm so sorry I don't work here.
5471380	5475380	And he was like okay can you tell me where the blah blah blah is?
5475380	5477380	I was asking.
5477380	5486380	And it was bewildering and I walked with him and found it with him.
5486380	5492380	And the entire time I was waiting for him to say something and he knew I didn't work
5492380	5493380	there.
5493380	5498380	I was sure to leave and say I'm going to go continue my shopping.
5498380	5500380	That is really weird.
5500380	5506380	That guy was that unwilling to say in the moment oh sorry.
5506380	5515380	Well I mean if you ask someone individually for help they'll do it like if you're in need
5515380	5518380	but it's just so strange in a store where there are people that are paid to do that
5518380	5519380	exact thing.
5519380	5521380	Do you think that's a guy just maybe flirting with you possibly?
5521380	5524380	Like he was like I don't want this transaction to be over.
5524380	5527380	I don't think you flirt by going okay so you can do it anyway.
5527380	5529380	Like I don't think that's.
5529380	5531380	Charles Barkley could get away with that.
5531380	5532380	But I don't think.
5532380	5533380	You haven't read the game?
5533380	5537380	That turns a woman on like a light.
5537380	5539380	He was negating her.
5539380	5541380	It was a long neg.
5541380	5545380	You're still not helping me.
5545380	5547380	Spencer why are you so mad right now man?
5547380	5549380	I hate to see you like this.
5549380	5553380	I just you know you guys are talking a lot of shit about Target.
5553380	5556380	They make a fine product.
5556380	5558380	Spencer do you get high before the show or during the show?
5558380	5559380	No.
5559380	5561380	When you're backstage are you getting high while we're out here?
5561380	5563380	That would be illegal.
5563380	5566380	All permutations you'd suggest it just then.
5566380	5568380	I think we have our answer.
5568380	5569380	You have a prescription.
5569380	5570380	You can get high anywhere you want.
5570380	5571380	What?
5571380	5572380	You have a prescription don't you?
5572380	5573380	No that stuff's illegal man.
5573380	5574380	The feds.
5574380	5575380	I'm not doing it.
5575380	5577380	Federally okay.
5577380	5579380	I have a prescription.
5579380	5581380	Come get me.
5581380	5583380	No you don't.
5583380	5584380	Hey he doesn't.
5584380	5585380	In case you're wondering.
5585380	5586380	It expired two years.
5586380	5587380	Yeah.
5587380	5591380	I'm so lazy that the feds would find nothing.
5591380	5594380	Are you high on your picture on your card?
5594380	5596380	Because I've seen it before and you look super high.
5596380	5601380	No I'm just that happy to be getting a pot card.
5601380	5605380	Every pot card picture is like eh.
5605380	5610380	I don't think I have it in my wallet but I'm so proud of it because I look I've always
5610380	5614380	said like when I looked at the photo I was like this is this is like a billboard for
5614380	5618380	a Jason Sudeikis movie about getting a pot card.
5618380	5619380	Pot card.
5619380	5620380	With Jason Sudeikis.
5620380	5622380	It's got like prescription.
5622380	5625380	Because like I'm in the photo I'm like.
5625380	5626380	I didn't get it.
5626380	5627380	I didn't get a card.
5627380	5630380	I just got a sheet that said put the doctor and everything.
5630380	5633380	I didn't pay extra for the card which I was happy to do.
5633380	5635380	I have never in my life.
5635380	5637380	There's so many memories I have you know.
5637380	5642380	One is of Sikhs mother and I also like I like.
5642380	5645380	Wait was that the most like highbrow yo mama.
5645380	5648380	I fucked yo mama too.
5648380	5650380	One is of Sikhs mother.
5650380	5651380	I have a memory of your mother.
5651380	5653380	With a multiple aneurysm survivor you don't have to fuck him.
5653380	5660380	You can just say I remember your mama.
5660380	5664380	Too soon?
5664380	5665380	You gotta get him in.
5665380	5667380	That's so good.
5667380	5670380	The yeah damn it you guys.
5670380	5677380	Walking to my car after like with a bag a pharmacy bag
5677380	5681380	with marijuana in it with a receipt stapled to it that said
5681380	5686380	Visa with like I bought it with a credit card.
5686380	5691380	Pot because I'm sick and I need medicine.
5691380	5693380	And capitalism and democracy.
5693380	5697380	What is your main ailment then that necessitates the pot.
5697380	5701380	I think they led me into nausea.
5701380	5703380	Yeah I don't know.
5703380	5704380	Do they like lead you.
5704380	5706380	I like walk you down the path.
5706380	5707380	They're like.
5707380	5710380	There's three doorways that you have to step through.
5710380	5714380	I have answered the pot riddle or the pot will not be granted forever.
5714380	5717380	I think ultimately it came down to.
5717380	5721380	Spencer can you give me pot dungeon master.
5721380	5724380	Wait what pot dungeon master.
5724380	5726380	What are you.
5726380	5730380	I'm not sure if I'm doing it or if I just don't know yet what your premise is.
5730380	5732380	Spencer how high are you.
5732380	5733380	I do.
5733380	5736380	You just said pot dungeon master like that.
5736380	5741380	I'm walking into a pot store and you're describing me walking into the dispensary.
5741380	5745380	Oh OK.
5745380	5747380	You're walking into a pot store.
5747380	5749380	There's magazines.
5749380	5754380	You got to sign in.
5754380	5756380	Spencer things have changed as I saw you last night.
5756380	5758380	Yeah man.
5758380	5760380	It's these testicles.
5760380	5764380	Speaking of prescriptions you know maybe Dan doesn't want to talk to him about this.
5764380	5766380	But he's got a prescription.
5766380	5773380	Yeah I know I turn out I had a huge I have a giggling deficiency.
5773380	5775380	Is what it came down to.
5775380	5777380	No I mean you got it.
5777380	5779380	You recently Dan recently got a prescription.
5779380	5780380	I guess you don't want.
5780380	5781380	Sorry.
5781380	5782380	You know.
5782380	5783380	Oh you mean.
5783380	5784380	Yeah no I don't think I want to.
5784380	5785380	Yeah.
5785380	5786380	OK.
5786380	5787380	All right.
5787380	5788380	Legal way.
5788380	5790380	I was recently diagnosed with ADD.
5790380	5791380	You have ADD.
5791380	5793380	We've known this.
5793380	5794380	Wait is that.
5794380	5799380	If you got diagnosed with ADD was it you in a waiting room with like all eight year olds.
5799380	5800380	Yes.
5800380	5804380	And you did you like vision during a test or like how did they know.
5805380	5811380	It's it took surprisingly a little time to get diagnosed.
5811380	5814380	I feel like I had to answer three questions.
5814380	5815380	Is this about scoring Adderall.
5815380	5816380	Is that the point.
5816380	5817380	It was.
5817380	5822380	Let's just say I went to Yelp's top psychiatrist.
5822380	5824380	So that season six could get done.
5824380	5828380	It was harder for me to get news to your wife.
5828380	5829380	What's that.
5829380	5830380	This is news.
5830380	5831380	Yes.
5831380	5832380	It's a medicine.
5832380	5834380	With your with your with your betrothed.
5834380	5835380	We're past it.
5835380	5837380	I'm a little ashamed of it.
5837380	5838380	And just wanted to.
5838380	5840380	It's a medicine.
5840380	5842380	People do this all the time.
5842380	5846380	And it's it's signed off on by doctors everywhere and politicians.
5846380	5847380	Everyone loves it.
5847380	5852380	It's you know overdoses are one of the leading causes of preventable death in America and
5852380	5854380	everyone's just smiling about it.
5854380	5855380	I don't.
5855380	5857380	There's nothing to be ashamed of except America.
5862380	5863380	It is.
5863380	5868380	I think we have the title of our episode.
5868380	5869380	Yeah.
5869380	5870380	I went in and I.
5870380	5871380	Yeah.
5871380	5872380	I'm sorry Dan.
5872380	5873380	I didn't.
5873380	5874380	I thought this is just you know.
5874380	5875380	Yeah.
5875380	5876380	No.
5876380	5877380	It's it's it's Dan dating anyone.
5877380	5878380	Yeah.
5878380	5882380	Well I mean I got a role for that I think.
5882380	5883380	Yeah.
5883380	5885380	I was I was going to tell you eventually.
5885380	5886380	Yeah.
5886380	5887380	I didn't think.
5887380	5888380	What do you mean.
5888380	5889380	Yeah.
5889380	5890380	Sarcastic.
5890380	5891380	No.
5891380	5892380	No.
5892380	5893380	No.
5893380	5894380	No.
5894380	5895380	Now I feel weird.
5895380	5896380	No it's fine.
5896380	5897380	It's fine.
5897380	5898380	Are you upset that he's been like not sharing the.
5898380	5899380	Maybe that's part of it.
5899380	5900380	I don't know.
5900380	5901380	No.
5901380	5902380	No.
5902380	5903380	No.
5903380	5904380	No.
5904380	5905380	I'm not upset you're not sharing it.
5905380	5906380	It seems like a secret the way it came out.
5906380	5907380	But it's fine.
5907380	5908380	You know I also.
5908380	5909380	Here's some other things.
5909380	5911380	I've been getting a lot of CAT scans about the things wrong with my chest my enlarged
5911380	5913380	lymph nodes and my sarcoidosis.
5913380	5914380	Yeah.
5914380	5915380	And then you get a.
5915380	5916380	It's fine.
5916380	5917380	I don't.
5917380	5918380	He goes to the doctor.
5918380	5919380	I just want you to be safe.
5919380	5920380	I just want you to be safe.
5920380	5921380	I'm not upset lately because he's working on community.
5921380	5922380	He's filled with Adderall.
5922380	5924380	You can't sleep on that shit.
5924380	5927380	Well he has to stay out because he's working late and I'm a little concerned about his.
5927380	5930380	How much do you sleep at night Dan?
5930380	5931380	Three.
5931380	5932380	Hours?
5932380	5934380	On a scale of one to ten.
5934380	5936380	Three hours.
5936380	5938380	Three balls.
5938380	5939380	I'm doing fine.
5939380	5940380	By the way I found out.
5940380	5941380	He's fine.
5941380	5942380	This isn't.
5942380	5945380	It went away.
5945380	5946380	You're healed.
5946380	5947380	You're cured.
5947380	5954380	I can smell it.
5954380	5956380	I don't think so.
5956380	5962380	So that that it turns out is tracheal stenosis which I think is just a heartening of the
5962380	5964380	cartilage and the trachea.
5964380	5972380	There's enlarged lymph nodes in my trachea that I have to get biopsied because they have
5973380	5978380	to rule out sarcoidosis which is only fatal five percent of the time.
5978380	5979380	All right.
5979380	5980380	Now you're all caught up.
5980380	5985380	They have to like they've got to put a thing down my throat and grab some cells and then
5985380	5987380	diagnose or not diagnose sarcoidosis.
5987380	5993380	If they diagnose it then it's a simple like it's 95 percent chance I'll live.
5993380	5994380	Yeah.
5994380	5997380	In dungeon master terms like you roll two dice and then.
5997380	5999380	Yeah that's like five rolls.
5999380	6000380	Roll down.
6000380	6003380	I would have to get a critical hit by God to die.
6003380	6004380	No we're good.
6004380	6005380	We're good.
6005380	6006380	Wait.
6006380	6007380	Maybe.
6007380	6008380	God auto crits.
6008380	6009380	God a one shot.
6009380	6010380	Yeah.
6010380	6011380	He auto crits.
6011380	6012380	There's no.
6012380	6014380	You don't have to wait for the 20 if you're God.
6014380	6021380	God doesn't play dice man.
6021380	6027380	I haven't I haven't in large lymph nodes which are battling something that they have to find
6027380	6028380	out what they're battling.
6028380	6029380	You know what they say.
6029380	6036380	Five percent chance of dying.
6036380	6038380	Sorry.
6038380	6046380	But also in the meantime I did pop by a doctor who I did tell I have trouble reading books.
6046380	6047380	You do.
6047380	6049380	And I see him at work.
6049380	6050380	That's just because you're late.
6050380	6051380	You go to the doctor with him.
6051380	6053380	Will you like his like hypeman.
6053380	6054380	Yes he did.
6054380	6055380	Yeah.
6055380	6056380	He's my chauffeur.
6056380	6057380	I don't have a car.
6057380	6058380	I can't tell.
6058380	6059380	I'm for it.
6059380	6063060	I think that he needs it more than a lot of people I've seen get Adderall and give it
6063060	6064060	to me.
6064060	6069580	So what's the thing that people not forgot not for Dan for my personal use in the past.
6069580	6070580	Sorry.
6070580	6071580	But I wasn't clear.
6071580	6076620	You just say that it that it causes death that people are ODing on it and no shame prescription
6076620	6082060	drugs kill more people than any other drug any illegal drug right all of it.
6082060	6083540	And it's everyone's fine with it.
6083540	6085540	Everyone's fine with people prescribing drugs.
6085540	6089220	So you're being sarcastic when you say it's good that he's doing this or no.
6089220	6094380	I'm saying he needs it more than other people that are using it you know to kill themselves
6094380	6102620	and he's using it responsibly so because a lot of people who have focused problems and
6102620	6108220	do work you know creative work work that requires a lot of hours who have serious ADD oftentimes
6108220	6112980	take medicine to treat that I don't why is this so controversial I don't want you Spencer
6112980	6113980	I understand.
6113980	6119740	You're saying in this case these drugs are good overall pharmaceuticals big overprescribed
6119740	6120740	problem in America.
6120740	6121740	Yeah.
6121740	6125700	And it's a problem that a lot of people actually hurt themselves with whereas Dan feels guilty
6125700	6132300	about this responsible usage because I'm taking advantage of a drug dealing nation because
6132300	6134940	they actually need the drug.
6134940	6135940	Yeah.
6135940	6136940	I agree with you.
6136940	6142340	But everyone would agree that one hour a night sleep no hours three hours sometimes is really
6142340	6143340	unhealthy.
6143340	6144340	Yeah.
6144340	6149740	Well that's not that that that is the case in like spurts with or without Adderall.
6149740	6152180	That's the that's that's a fact like that.
6152180	6153180	That just happens.
6153180	6154420	That's workaholism.
6154420	6162620	That's something that there is no drug for except money.
6162620	6166540	I mean you know I didn't want to I wanted to bring it up on my own time.
6166540	6169700	I was excited about it because also I don't want to be like I don't want to be like a
6169700	6174340	whistleblower because it was kind of fascinating like going I got a prescription for Adderall
6174340	6179820	and it took about 20 minutes and I answered three questions and then the doctor said you
6179820	6185820	definitely have a DD which I don't think doctors are supposed to say about anything ever.
6185820	6187940	What what what what are the questions they ask you.
6187940	6188940	What's this like.
6188940	6190940	I'm genuinely curious.
6190940	6193420	I feel like I feel like I'm kind of like if you don't want to talk about it.
6193420	6194420	That's fine.
6194420	6199260	Give you like a little cat laser and like going around the room.
6199260	6204340	If you look at it once then you get the they were questions that I answered honestly.
6204340	6208940	I don't think that they're the questions you need to triangulate a DD as a diagnosis.
6208940	6211260	I don't think you know what do you think about Russell Brand.
6211260	6212820	What do you think about Lady Dunham.
6212820	6213820	OK good.
6213820	6214820	Yeah.
6214820	6215820	Now here you go.
6215820	6217780	I described my situation and why I was there.
6217780	6222260	I said honestly like I felt like like like honestly it for you know people had given
6222260	6226940	me Adderall in the past and I had taken it and had a speedy effect and kept me up and
6226940	6230900	that recently like and it actually had like more of a focusing effect like I'm actually
6230900	6235780	able to get work done instead of like not wanting to get work done and then I'm actually
6235780	6242940	also nicer to Aaron like I find myself coming like like kind of like like if I if I take
6242940	6248740	10 milligrams I will actually like kind of I don't know like I'm a little more respectful
6248740	6255100	to her which I'm I'm I'm I'm embarrassed about it because it's a pharmaceutical.
6255100	6256980	I am genuinely embarrassed about it.
6256980	6258740	People take drugs and it helps them.
6258740	6263100	I honestly don't think it's anything to do but I don't think that this guy is like qualified
6263100	6264100	to say.
6264100	6265100	No but you are.
6265100	6266100	That's not your responsibility.
6266100	6270420	It seems like you've used this drug before and it helped you and it had a good effect.
6270420	6272860	People are depressed and they take drugs and then it makes them better.
6272860	6273860	I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
6273860	6276380	I don't want to prescribe but in a lot of cases.
6276380	6279100	I don't want to think that my personality is based on.
6279100	6280100	But it's not.
6280100	6281100	I don't like that idea.
6281100	6283940	It's not like these drugs you're taking are changing your personality.
6283940	6286220	Is it better than that dirty street Adderall you were getting.
6286220	6287220	But until now.
6287220	6288220	It's all the same.
6288220	6293500	I mean it's just making your brain better at understand at the it's going to be a fucking
6293500	6297780	good season of community man.
6297780	6302300	It's going to be great.
6302300	6303420	It fucking hurts.
6303420	6308660	It's like scraping metal against concrete and I but Aaron said that I guess I always
6308660	6310220	say that.
6310220	6312020	Yes.
6312020	6314380	I feel really bummed about that one time you texted me.
6314380	6316140	I was really really upset about that.
6316140	6317140	Wait.
6317140	6318140	Not when you texted me.
6318140	6319140	I don't know if you should talk about that.
6319140	6320140	Wait what did I.
6320140	6321140	No no no.
6321140	6322140	You texted me about community.
6322140	6323140	What about.
6323140	6324140	What did I say.
6324140	6325140	Well I don't know for.
6325140	6326140	Just say it.
6326140	6328460	You were like hey do you want to come and do something.
6328460	6329460	Oh.
6329460	6330460	Oh.
6330460	6332140	And then I couldn't do it and I was really bummed out that I couldn't do it.
6332140	6333140	Oh yeah yeah.
6333140	6334140	Second choice.
6334140	6335140	You texted me after Kumail.
6335140	6338140	Wait is he going to be on community?
6338140	6339140	No.
6339140	6341140	That's the other Adam Golder.
6341660	6347660	My rule with him is I said you have to land one bit from the audience.
6347660	6348660	That's why he keeps trying.
6348660	6349660	Yes.
6349660	6352300	That's just a grasshopper for my hands.
6352300	6355380	You can hook one ring around the pole.
6355380	6356380	Yeah.
6356380	6357380	Yeah.
6357380	6358380	Yeah.
6358380	6361380	A bunch of monkeys just wrote a Shakespeare play before you landed alive.
6361380	6365460	I need zero for a hundred and sixteen.
6365460	6370500	I know he's actually got through that.
6370500	6373140	You know what bums me out is that we got I'm back.
6373140	6376620	We got the whole fucking cast here and we're over time.
6376620	6378900	We can't play D&D now.
6378900	6381620	We started so late though technically.
6381620	6384300	Well I mean even starting that late we're still pretty much.
6384300	6385300	I know.
6385300	6386300	I could.
6386300	6387300	Why don't we just.
6387300	6388300	No that's dumb.
6388300	6389300	No no no.
6389300	6391660	I was going to say why don't we just explain to Jeff what happened.
6391660	6392660	Yeah.
6392660	6396380	Fill me in what I missed and we'll be ready to go for next time.
6396380	6397380	I mean.
6397380	6398380	Yeah.
6398380	6399380	I would like to hear.
6399380	6400380	I also haven't been around.
6401260	6402260	I have a picture.
6402260	6403260	Yes.
6403260	6407180	I want to use my power to make the audience applaud at something so that Spencer is compelled
6407180	6409980	to it.
6409980	6415820	I think what would be amazing is if Spencer spent did whatever he did wanted to do tonight
6415820	6420100	but then the next time we see him in the new year he has learned and is ready to start
6420100	6423140	a shadow run campaign.
6423140	6424140	What is that.
6424140	6425140	You see it didn't pull.
6425140	6426140	Okay.
6426900	6428300	You're hearing mostly Adam.
6428300	6431300	It's a cyberpunk thing from the 80s.
6431300	6436020	Hey it was from the 80s but now it's from it's like a William Gibson.
6436020	6437020	Yeah.
6437020	6438020	Yeah.
6438020	6439020	Yeah.
6439020	6440020	Yeah.
6440020	6441020	That was a Sega Genesis game.
6441020	6442020	It's like Blade Runner.
6442020	6443020	Yeah.
6443020	6444020	Yeah.
6444020	6445020	But there's elves and dwarves and shit too.
6445020	6449220	It's set in a world where magic has returned to an apocalyptically techno.
6449220	6451020	It was called like the NGE.
6451020	6452220	There was like an acronym for it.
6452220	6453220	It was like the big awakening.
6453220	6455980	But it's a role playing game like D and D. Yeah.
6455980	6458660	It's like D and D but with guns and lasers and racism.
6458660	6464940	Well I guess like it's like D and D. All the.
6464940	6470060	Do you have that as a stat like racism 15 or like you got a role for your racism.
6470060	6474060	Oh fuck I'm a bitch.
6474060	6476060	I'm plus 15 versus Asians.
6476060	6481980	Oh yeah I guess different races you're more powerful.
6481980	6484420	I'm sorry.
6484420	6485420	Does that mean.
6485420	6489860	Like what are you trying to pull off when you need a higher racism.
6489860	6492820	Do you need to say something racist country or something.
6492820	6497140	Maybe they would like give you more gold or I don't know.
6497140	6501020	You make Thanksgiving more uncomfortable for other people.
6501020	6502020	Yeah.
6502020	6503020	All right.
6503020	6505500	Well we're a game.
6505500	6509780	I'm still learning how to play so it'll be embarrassing for me.
6509780	6511940	Did Shadowrun start as that video game.
6511940	6513500	I only know it from the video game.
6513500	6514500	It was around before that.
6515100	6520180	It was around in like early 80s and it was like they were like cool things like com links
6520180	6526780	cell phones and like you know pocket computers cell phones again.
6526780	6527780	Small flashlights.
6527780	6531460	They always have fake internet.
6531460	6532460	Small flashlights.
6532460	6537340	That was a huge component of Shadowrun.
6537340	6539500	Selfie generators cell phones.
6539500	6542620	Cat picture storage.
6542620	6543620	Yeah.
6543620	6544620	Lena Dunham buggers.
6544620	6545620	Buggers.
6545620	6546620	I don't know.
6546620	6547620	It's a Bob Trotter.
6547620	6548620	I think.
6548620	6549620	I'm sure she's feeling very bugged.
6549620	6555740	Spencer do you want music where you are recap for me what happened to catch me up to date
6555740	6556740	or what's going on.
6556740	6557740	Me.
6557740	6558740	No.
6558740	6559740	No.
6559740	6560740	I don't know what happened.
6560740	6561740	What's the last thing you remember.
6561740	6562740	Oh god.
6562740	6563740	Nothing.
6563740	6564740	Okay.
6564740	6565740	Well that's.
6565740	6566740	That's probably safe.
6566740	6567740	I mean shoot.
6567740	6568740	I mean at some point there was a we were in a toilet.
6568740	6569740	I know that.
6569740	6570740	It's been a long time.
6570740	6571740	There's a bucket.
6571740	6573420	We were going back and forth in a bucket.
6573420	6574420	Oh right.
6574420	6578460	We were doing portal jumping through a bucket and that was when I was around Bill Mardigan's
6578460	6579460	and there was that.
6579460	6580460	I don't know what happened.
6580460	6585980	So you went to a stone what was the book Rose book Rose book you went to Rose book right
6585980	6589900	because there was intrigue happening in Rose book with father Tinder.
6589900	6594900	He turned out to be a kind of unsavory sort of figure and you were snooping around in
6594900	6595900	his juice.
6595900	6596900	All right.
6596900	6598980	We were snooping.
6598980	6599980	You were.
6599980	6600980	Yeah.
6600980	6602740	You were snooping around with him and killed him turned out.
6602740	6603740	It was him.
6603740	6606180	It was just a big trick to lure you guys out.
6606180	6611980	He turned into a crazy demon and then he got smoked by the party and then the police came
6611980	6613460	up and they didn't buy.
6613460	6617500	They weren't like happy about the fact that you guys had killed their mayor.
6617500	6622060	And so you guys booked it from the police and then you guys didn't know what to do for
6622060	6628100	like a long time and you went and talked to a lady named I think Charles who is bathing
6628100	6634780	in the swamp and bothered her a while and then you left and then you ran into a fire
6634780	6638300	elemental and Quark raped the fire elemental.
6638300	6640900	That doesn't sound like Quark.
6640900	6643620	But the thing is fire elementals are made out of fire.
6643620	6650660	So Quark's dick melted off and he had it coming.
6650660	6653060	He really did.
6653060	6654060	You live fast.
6654060	6665540	If you can't stand the heat, keep your dick out of the fire elemental.
6665540	6668140	Then it turned out there was a secret magical shard of power.
6668140	6673900	It was like a plot MacGuffin and it was back at town and it turned out that the frost giant
6673900	6681180	he stole it and Admiral Darkstar went after that guy, the frost giant.
6681180	6684540	And so you guys were like, let's go over there and you were like, I don't know where
6684540	6685540	to go.
6685540	6692600	So you met up with a little boy named Lil Baskins and he turned out to be, you know,
6692600	6695400	not just a little boy, but like a little boy ghost.
6695400	6698300	But despite being a ghost, he was a pretty cool guy.
6698300	6703580	So he took you guys through the ghost way and then you came out in a forest and ran
6703580	6708780	into some gnolls who were trying to come up with a, uh, with an ambush, but they were
6708780	6710260	too slow.
6710300	6711380	And so they were going to fight.
6711380	6712820	It seemed like they were going to fight.
6712820	6716900	And then it turns out that they just wanted that blood book that a Sharpie had and they
6716900	6722180	offered to buy it and then Sharpie acquiesced and then he just sold the book.
6722180	6728100	And people say part is bad for your memory and you're disproving that.
6728100	6729100	Yeah.
6729100	6735500	I disprove all stereotypes about things I'm into.
6735500	6736500	It's nice.
