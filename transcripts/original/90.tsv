0	17120	Hello, you beautiful sons of bitches, from Meltdown Comics in Hollywood, California.
17120	20640	Harman Town is now in session.
20640	24400	I'd like to hear the lights.
24400	29600	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman.
29600	42560	It's probably not that different for them, but the lighting is very different for the
42560	43960	performer tonight.
43960	45840	They're shooting different kinds of stuff in here lately.
45840	48840	Are they shooting at like an autopsy scene?
48840	54680	There is like what seems to be like the light that Quincy used to figure out how people
54680	58720	got killed, yeah, above me, or I'm like a chicken McNugget.
58720	65440	I'm fine with it, and I'm sure I look great, but it's just funny how the little things
65440	66440	kind of throw you.
66440	67440	I like these though.
67440	73000	Maybe for D&D, we could get these little kind of groovy old like early Edison lights.
73000	74320	Yeah, well, Zach was taking me through.
74320	76560	He's got full control over every single bulb in the building.
76560	77560	Anyone you want?
77560	78560	No, I'm kidding.
78560	83040	Zach, can you take us through a couple of moods right now or no?
83040	85680	Here's his list of moods you can accomplish with his controls.
85680	86680	Okay.
86680	87680	Here's this one.
87680	88680	Right.
88680	89680	There you go.
89680	90680	All right.
90680	95960	I'm sure those of you listening at home understand that what we did was the old joke where there's
95960	96960	two things.
96960	97960	Okay.
97960	101200	One of them was light bulbs on, one was light bulbs off.
101200	105320	Oh no, but they can be slowly dimmed to terrifying effect.
105320	107320	It's kind of nice.
107320	108320	All right, Jeff.
108320	109320	Yes, Dan?
109320	112360	What I learned from the last couple of episodes is that it's going to be a segment driven
112360	113360	show now.
113360	115040	We've got segments, segments, segments.
115040	116840	No tangents, more segments.
116840	131520	All right, so here's our new segment called, it's called Help Me Help Myself.
131520	136840	See, people love it.
136840	137840	They love segments.
137840	138840	That's it, really.
138840	152720	Okay, so I need help with a couple of things.
152720	154560	Facebook.
154560	159200	Help me with Facebook.
159200	160200	Here's my dilemma.
160200	164440	I got lots of fucking problems with Facebook.
164440	166800	So I have a Facebook account.
166800	173440	I have at this point, I don't know, let's just say 42,000 friends.
173440	176200	I'm putting air quotes around friends, of course, because what that really means is
176200	187680	like fans who I consider friends and who I certainly treat better than most of my friends.
187680	196680	My Facebook page is, I never go to it and the inbox is just full of people going like,
197680	200720	I met you at such and such.
200720	207120	It sort of renders Facebook's actual usefulness kind of neutral.
207120	208440	Facebook isn't really useful for me.
208440	211920	So I never go to it and the syndrome continues.
211920	215440	So I'm just wondering what the hell I'm supposed to do.
215440	219880	This is a question you can't really ask without sounding like an asshole because you're like
219880	221320	kind of humble bragging, aren't you?
221320	225040	You're going like somebody, what should I do?
225040	229000	Because there's people that have the fan things.
229000	232360	This is the Ronald McDonald fan page.
232360	234400	I'm a follower of Ronald McDonald.
234400	236800	I'm not his friend though.
236800	241200	And then there's Ronald McDonald's actual Facebook page, I assume, where he's like,
241200	244720	I fucked Grimace last night.
244720	245720	Check it out.
245720	246720	Here's a picture of it.
246720	248000	And he's like, you know, and it's cool.
248000	252160	It's fine because it's like, it's only the fry guys and like hamburgers are like, yeah.
252160	260360	And he like leaves a comment, says, rabble, rabble, and you know, birdie, birdie, birdie
260360	263040	liked this.
263040	266200	Birdie likes everything.
266200	271200	Moon head, moon heads performing at the piano bar again.
271200	272800	Was he just Mac?
272800	273800	What was his name?
273800	274800	I don't know.
274800	275800	Yeah, Mac.
275800	276800	Mac tonight?
276800	278920	Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac of desperation.
279760	287520	That was the dark chapter of McDonald's, otherwise bright and shining, delightful, entertaining
287520	288520	cavalcade of characters.
288520	293040	So are you asking, should you be more, should you treat Facebook more like a bandwidth?
293040	294240	I need to do something.
294240	297760	I need, I need, I need someone to Facebook coach me.
297760	300500	I need a, I need somebody to say, here's what you do.
300500	306840	Take your existing account with your 48 million whatevers, you know, do you convert that into
306840	308000	a thing?
308080	311240	Or do you, do you have to go through and unfriend?
311240	312640	You have to break up a 48 million.
312640	317000	I have to, I have to, I have to, I have to go, I have to make an announcement.
317000	321600	This is a thing that like LA standups like go through and like, like they, I think sometimes
321600	323100	because I've heard stories.
323100	326160	That's the other thing that has me gun shy is that people go like, well, my name's Dave
326160	327160	Johnson.
327160	331440	And I, they go like, like, oh man, I'm, you know what, I'm going to change my Facebook
331440	332840	account to a fan account.
332840	334720	And then all the friends are like, fuck you.
334720	339480	And it's, it's, it's, you know, there's, there's a, it's, it's not exciting to the audience
339480	340480	at all.
340480	344460	And I don't know why I thought it would be, I thought maybe a Facebook expert could come
344460	346120	up and help me.
346120	347920	That would be amazing.
347920	348920	Let's move on.
348920	353400	I mean, I would, I would guess that if we asked my applause, you would get several Facebook
353400	355720	experts that would be quite happy to help you on that.
355720	359640	And who would be quite proud to be Facebook experts, I'm sure.
359640	362960	But for me, cause I was always, you know, like notoriously single and I have a girlfriend,
362960	367160	but Facebook, the only like perceivable benefit that ever was was you could go look up a picture
367160	369180	of a girl you saw last night.
369180	374320	You can type in her name and a couple of triangulating bits of information you go, okay.
374320	375320	She was cute.
375320	379480	Or maybe she, she's a weirdo and she has a tattoo of a racial slur on her forehead or
379480	385120	like, uh, uh, but like as somebody has like, I have no, I have no use for it now.
385120	386680	Now I get in trouble.
386680	389600	I got in trouble a little bit, not really a joking trouble with my girlfriend.
389600	394840	Today, because she was, she loves Facebook cause she's from, uh, uh, Scotland.
394840	397120	So it's like, she keeps in touch with her friends and family for free.
397120	398120	That's great.
398120	400000	Um, I, I, I'm from here.
400000	404440	I see all the people I like, uh, I liked three people from school and one of them is coming
404440	410380	on the show tonight and anyone else I don't really need to talk to, but, uh, uh, I am,
410380	414920	because of you, I've been playing Heyday, that little game where you make a little farm
414920	418080	and she's like, Oh, so you like Katie's farm, huh?
419080	423840	I'm like, what is like, I click like, and it tells everybody I know that I liked a farm.
426720	431160	That's the fucking worst thing I want to know about my Facebook Heyday paper trail.
433880	437240	I'm proud of my Candy Crush paper trail because I put a lot of fucking work in on that.
437240	437840	Do you want help?
437840	439320	Do you want help with your apple tree?
439560	440760	Uh, yeah, well, fuck it.
440760	441880	I want help with my apple tree.
441880	443280	I don't know that that means that it's like,
443280	450720	just an old man, no country for old men.
450720	455000	This internet, um, it's just too goddamn busy and it changes too much.
455000	457160	And I know it's like, there's just too much shit going on on it.
457680	460160	And the pictures are always like, every time you try to look at pictures is different.
460520	460800	Yeah.
460800	461160	I don't like it.
461520	461800	Yeah.
462840	463120	All right.
463120	463760	Fuck Facebook.
463760	464920	That's the conclusion.
464920	466040	I don't need help with Facebook.
466040	466600	Fuck Facebook.
466600	467960	Fuck the movie about Facebook.
469120	469680	I like that movie.
469720	470280	That's a good movie.
471520	472160	Fuck you.
472320	472960	Oh, okay.
473760	474240	That's fine.
474280	474840	That's valid.
476040	476480	All right.
476560	481840	So here's the, here's the last, here's the second and last item in this segment that I need help with.
481840	482200	What was it called?
482200	482880	My help myself.
482880	484720	Help me help you help me help myself.
484720	485920	I came up with that on the fly.
486360	491280	It's a, it's a take on, on the, uh, help me help you from, uh, Jerry McDoodles.
492080	498240	Um, so, uh, so when you, when you get it, when you get an Uber, a lot of my, a lot of my time is spent
498240	500400	in Ubers now, Uber, Uber, Uber cars.
500400	502680	The, the, the non-taxi, you get a ride.
502680	513520	So one of the things that makes it a non-taxi ride is, uh, the compulsive insistence of the driver on opening
513520	522960	the door for you, and it's especially annoying when upon arrival, because it truly slows you down.
523360	526800	That you pull up and like, okay, we're here.
526800	528480	And he's like scrambling.
528520	532160	It's, it's, it's, it's, they, they, they tell them or something.
532160	534760	Someone's telling people you have to open the door for them.
534760	536240	That's what makes it not a cab.
536920	540800	And it's, I, I keep, I, sometimes I have success by going like, I got the door.
540800	541160	It's fine.
541160	543400	And then they're like, oh fuck, okay.
545160	547360	But like, you have to like assert yourself.
547360	549120	You have to like deny someone something.
549120	552920	And if you don't, if you just go with the flow, it's the most ridiculous thing in the world.
552920	558040	You pull up to a thing, a yogurt bin, wherever you're going.
559760	562800	And not the one close by your house that you could walk to.
562800	564760	The one that the good one that you have to get a ride to.
564760	566320	That crosstown yogurt bin.
566320	566600	Yeah.
567720	569200	The, uh, over by the bazaar.
569200	570040	And you know how to take your own car there?
570040	572080	Because you know how the parking is at the crosstown yogurt bin.
572080	575880	I'm not driving back drunk on yogurt through all those Burbank cops.
575880	577800	Uh, that's what they're waiting for.
577800	580280	There's like three, three cops right outside the yogurt bin.
580280	582200	Like, uh, we're going to get them.
582200	586120	Uh, you pull up and then it's just, it's just, I don't know.
586120	586920	What do you, what do you do?
586920	592120	I would say here's, I will, I will give this advice to you if I could help you help yourself on this one.
592120	595640	If you're going to start taking Ubers everywhere and you're going to be,
595640	597960	you're going to keep getting out of the back seat of a car.
597960	598520	Yes.
598520	600120	And open by a gentleman.
600120	601240	Own it. You want me to own it.
601240	603480	Start wearing long white fur coats.
604760	608840	And, and, and like, and, and like a nylon stockings and like kind of put my leg up.
608840	609400	Oh yeah, or that.
609400	610680	So that the camera can pan up.
610680	611480	There you are.
611480	612920	Yeah. Start doing some up skirts.
612920	617000	Like some, uh, some nip slips, like really fucking get, like give us something.
617000	619160	All right. Make it worth our while.
619160	621240	I'll get like a prop poodle.
621960	625160	Yeah. The high heel shoes with a goldfish in the thing.
625160	626280	Yeah. Let me do the whole thing.
626280	628200	I'll just always have shopping bags with me.
629240	631160	See, that might be useful if I got a bunch of shit.
631160	631640	I don't know.
632600	633080	All right.
634120	640520	My next segment is, uh, is called, uh, uh, star bound video game I'm playing.
641960	644760	Star bound is great.
645560	647320	It's a great video game. All right.
647320	647880	That was it.
647880	648360	Yep.
650360	653080	Wait, Dan, you just learned how to help yourself.
653720	655320	You didn't need us to help you on that one.
655320	657960	No, no, no. That's the, that's the, that's the old segment.
657960	658600	I know.
659640	660920	That was the two different segments.
660920	664280	Okay. Well, I mean, I was just excited that you, that you've already,
664280	667800	like you went from helplessness to completely activated.
667800	670440	Oh no, no. Yeah. I only need help with the Ubers and the Facebook.
670760	672920	Star bound. I'm good. It's great. It's a great game.
672920	674520	Did you give up on your, on your eye harmon?
674520	676440	That you're not, I mean, you gave up on it pretty quickly.
676440	676920	Yeah.
676920	677960	Gave up. Yep.
677960	680920	I mean, you came in pretty hard on that one or high and hard.
680920	684760	What was the deciding factor on no more notepads around your neck?
684760	686840	I just can't, I, it just wasn't working.
686840	691800	It just doesn't, if I have a, I'm using a new kind of app that works with Evernote
691800	696200	that, uh, my friend Kevin Day, uh, recommended to me.
697240	698520	It's called ever memo.
698520	705880	And all it does is it just lets you put in a memo and it puts it into Evernote for you.
706920	711400	So it kind of does it, does Evernote roll its eyes when that happens?
712600	716040	I think, I think he's still using Evernote.
716840	719880	We got him like, yeah, it's kind of built on top of Evernote.
719880	722760	I don't get it anymore. I don't like just kill myself.
723800	727320	Give me an app that's just like a rope that I can just kill myself.
727320	729720	I just want to make a keyboard. It doesn't work it away.
729720	733640	You can't type anymore. They're just, they're just weeding people like me out, man.
733640	736280	For a while you had, you had the affectation of carrying around the
736280	739320	little magnetic ball chain thing that you can make little shapes and stuff.
739320	743480	And you were like, you're like a cute little like savant baby at the restaurant.
745880	748680	And nobody bothered you because you were clearly making a cube.
748680	749640	I looked weird. Yeah.
750360	751960	Looked like I could strangle you with it.
753800	756520	Anyways, I'm still looking at this. There's only one more thing on it.
756520	760200	I don't like Southwest Airlines. I don't, uh, we went to Sketchfest and
761320	764600	I, I, I don't like this first come first serve seating thing.
764600	768280	I don't like the weird combination between that and the, uh, you're in section a.
768840	771080	We're going to call. I don't, I don't, I don't get it.
772040	774760	No one likes to get on an airplane. Nobody likes air travel.
776280	779880	They, they, they just, they cram you into this little tube.
779880	783960	You might die. I know that you're more likely to die in the freeway,
784040	787480	but you're also more likely to die by your own hand on the freeway.
787480	791160	Like you must, you're more likely to have the satisfaction of skidding into another
791160	793720	guy, making eye contact with them before you get decapitated.
793720	800040	And both of you going like, fuck you or just like, or just like, oh shit.
800040	801720	Like on an airplane, it's just, fuck it.
801720	804520	There's just some coked up Denzel Washington in the cockpit.
804520	807400	And you know, you're flying upside down because you hit turbulence.
807400	809400	You don't know what's going on. They could get over the thing.
809400	810760	Are they telling you the truth or not?
810760	814360	There's just some asshole up there, like some gas holes all around you
814360	817320	bossing you around, put your phone in airplane mode.
817320	819320	You can use it now. You can't use it.
819320	825480	Hey, by the way, I, I, I had my phone out of airplane mode the whole time.
826440	829480	Science experiment over the plane doesn't crash.
829480	831880	Let's do, let's done with this fucking garbage.
831880	833160	I know they just changed the rules.
833160	836520	So now you can actually, oh, you can have the things on, but also what the fuck?
836520	838040	Why are they always bossing you around?
838040	843240	Why is everything a fucking caveat and a disclaimer that items may have shifted in
843240	849560	the thing or how many, what fucking asshole got knocked out by a duffel bag in 1938
850440	851960	that we all have to listen.
851960	855560	Do you know the amount of time put together that we've all had to listen
855560	858600	to that fucking warning about how items may have shifted.
859160	860360	What the fuck is going on?
860360	861800	Have you ever seen an item shift?
861800	863320	Have you ever seen anything fall out?
863320	865480	Has anyone ever gotten hurt?
865480	870360	Obviously one person did and they're so worried about that $50,000 lawsuit that
870360	874200	for fucking 50 years they've been telling you about the items shifting.
874200	875480	I just, I just hate them.
875480	875960	I hate them.
875960	876600	I hate them.
876600	881800	That's how Billy Mays died.
881800	883880	Billy Mays died.
883880	884760	The baseball player.
885400	887000	That's really painless.
887000	889480	First of all, I can't, this lighting means I can't see you.
889480	891400	I know the infomercial guy.
891400	891720	Oh yeah.
891720	894760	The, the, the, the Koki infomercial guy, the ShamWow or whatever the hell,
894760	897160	not the ShamWow guy, but the oxy clean.
897160	901320	He died by item shiftage in the overhead.
901320	903400	He died because his heart exploded from cocaine.
905080	907560	I mean, and also, but not only did you do that, Adam,
907560	911560	but before you did it, I think you went really like, like, like you were incredulous about.
913080	913880	Mid rant.
913880	916920	You fucking rantis interruptus.
916920	920440	Yeah, I have, I have blue rant now.
922120	924120	My, my, my outrage just numb.
925720	926280	Hurts.
926280	931000	Someone's got to give me a massage me with their hand until I'm angry about something again.
933400	935320	I wish you all could have been up there for the show.
935320	939160	We did a couple nights ago in San Francisco where a fellow named Jeremy came out on stage
939160	941640	and then shit went just straight up.
941640	942760	Well, they've heard it by now.
942760	947000	If they're like, but, but Neil Brooke, the guy that's shooting a documentary said,
947000	948760	like, I hated that Evo girl.
948760	952440	And I was like, you wouldn't have, if you saw her, you would have hated the guy more.
953160	954600	There's a thing that you don't visit.
954600	959160	There's an oral versus visual experience you have with podcasts and live shows where
960040	963000	nobody really had a problem with her that I could, I mean, maybe somebody did,
963000	966200	but as one, the audience instantly didn't like that guy.
966200	971000	And it was, and it was, it wasn't because he, you know, was, was wearing like a KKK outfit.
971000	972360	Like he was just, he was.
972360	975000	I would qualify that and say, well, as I said up there, I don't,
975000	979160	I don't know how many people didn't actually decided that they didn't, they didn't like him.
979160	984920	I think that like a mass majority of people suddenly decided that they didn't believe him.
984920	988600	Yeah. But then, but then when it was like, well, let's, maybe he's just awkward and maybe just
988600	990280	this, but then it was just like, boom.
991240	994920	I think that at some point they just would rather him not have been up there or whatever.
994920	995640	Yeah. I don't know.
995640	997720	I think if they all went out and had a drink with him after the show,
997720	998840	like everything might've been fine.
998840	1004680	But just as far as the moment somebody came up on stage and made it onto the stage,
1004680	1008680	that person ceased to be one of them and became somebody that they wanted not up there.
1009080	1009720	Best paying customers.
1009720	1012440	Yeah. I think everybody, everybody that comes to a Harmontown show, they go like,
1012440	1016040	you know, they like the fact that somebody can come up, they like that experience,
1016040	1020280	but that person owes a lot to the audience because the audience is sitting there thinking,
1020280	1025240	I paid $10 too. I'd love to be on stage. Maybe, maybe not. But in either case,
1025240	1028200	I'm not coming up there. So what the fuck are you doing up there?
1028200	1032680	And you better, you better make it good. And I think people are less prone to feel that way
1032680	1037320	when they're listening to the podcast than when they're sitting in the audience because they
1037320	1042120	waited in line, et cetera. And they can, pheromones and visuals, body language.
1042120	1045880	That's why that phenomenon of like in the early days, it was like Adam Goldberg,
1045880	1050920	do you love him or hate him? Is he a, is he a, is he a hamburger or a hero?
1052200	1056680	And I think it seemed like people that listened to the podcast for like, I don't mind Adam Goldberg.
1056680	1060040	He's fine. He's yeah. Cause he's like coming through one channel and,
1060040	1063080	and you're just, you're just chopping carrots and he's not fucking with that.
1063080	1068680	But you come, there's a difference if you're sitting in the crowd.
1068680	1073320	But here you, you know that if you were chopping carrots and he could fuck with that, he would.
1075400	1078280	It's been a long time since we talked to Adam Goldberg, isn't it? Should we just bring him up
1078280	1082120	and just like, like, let's just talk to him. Adam, Adam, get up on stage, you little devil.
1087800	1089560	The crowd goes mild. I love it.
1089560	1096680	The, the ever increasingly tepid applause and bringing you up on stage.
1096680	1101640	Fine. It's fine. It's the, the joke was stale a year and a half ago and I'm fine.
1102840	1104200	So you hate stale premises?
1105960	1111240	I'm reinventing this premise. You know what? In the last year, I got an O from,
1111240	1113240	I'm reinventing myself with this.
1113240	1115240	You haven't been up here long enough to start judging people yet.
1115960	1117720	No, it's the, you're right. It's fair point.
1117720	1120600	Also you, and not to derail a derailment, but you,
1121720	1125240	she made one little sound that was the sound of enjoying a show and you,
1125240	1127320	you've been, for the last 10 minutes, you go like,
1129960	1131240	Robbo, Robbo, yes.
1133960	1136840	It means I've been rooting for you and Grimace for a long time.
1139640	1144360	Robbo, Robbo. But yeah, he did die from a, he was,
1144360	1147320	he died because a bunch of junk fell on him in an airplane.
1148360	1149160	That's not true.
1149160	1155240	Fox News, Fox News, the local Fox News says it's true, not Fox News, the international one.
1155240	1158120	I would say his, his, his publicist wants you to think that's true.
1159880	1162680	That'd be the most, the worst day as a publicist where you have to be like,
1162680	1165080	how did he die? He was unpacking his suitcase.
1165080	1168520	I don't know how he died, but if he, if he died because an item fell on him,
1168520	1172520	it was a kilo of cocaine and it fell into his nostril.
1173320	1175880	I would like to see it. That's a, I don't know if a myth,
1175880	1180600	myth busters should address that. Like how, like, can you create a situation where items
1180600	1186200	shift enough in an overhead compartment that, you know, how much damage can you do to a human being
1186200	1191560	that's unwarned? You know, and then, and then the most important part is now let's warn them and
1191560	1197240	see what fucking changes because what are we, am I, am I Neo for the matrix? If I know that the
1197240	1201960	items have shifted, I'm going to like do a backbend and it's going to bullet time over my shoulder.
1201960	1207800	And what the hell is up there? Oh, how fast is it traveling? What the fuck is that? Those
1207800	1212600	things open like DeLorean doors. They open like the gold wings. What's going to jump out? Like a
1212600	1218600	fucking, does somebody have a, have a, have the monster from basket case in there? Is it a, is it
1218600	1229880	a, is it a, is it a critter from the, uh, from, from the joke one guy got? That was a, that was a
1229880	1236760	Kumail laugh from the Roger Corman classic, right? Is that just Kumail digging the shelf in the
1236760	1241080	background? I didn't want to give you blue rant in the middle there. All right. It was a creature
1241080	1246440	from critter. Okay. So Adam, uh, how, how are you doing? What, what are you doing? I started,
1246440	1253240	I started my own business. I do search engine, uh, strategy and optimization. I make sure online
1253240	1258200	stores actually sell things when they want to, which is important when people only go to one
1258200	1263720	website to buy things. How do you, so, so, so target comes to you. I know they don't, but let's
1263720	1268200	say target comes to you and open this, uh, it's like, uh, like a fishing expo in Minnesota and
1268200	1272840	like, uh, people aren't buying enough fishing lures. We got 3% of customers buying them. Can
1272840	1277560	you get that up to six? And I'm like, yes. So you look at the things that happen when you Google
1277560	1283400	fishing lures and you see, and you, you, you, what are you, I changed websites so that they,
1283400	1287800	people aren't like, I guess I don't need a fishing lure. Maybe the ones I have are good.
1287800	1292520	I don't want to click through 15 different pages as opposed to like getting coffee for
1292520	1298200	people and driving RVs badly, which was the last year of my life and producing that shark movie,
1298200	1303240	which everyone, I got fired from it two days after talking about being on it here.
1303240	1307320	And everyone got carbon monoxide poisoning because they rented sheep trailers.
1308360	1311400	And are you still under investigation for that?
1311400	1317160	Yeah. Have police eliminated you as a possible suspect?
1318040	1322120	Well, they, they Googled Adam Goldberg. Yeah. Nothing came up.
1322120	1323400	They just saw a lovely fishing lure.
1325000	1326280	Let's all go fishing.
1326280	1330040	He seems a little short to be on the Vikings. I don't think that's a guy. No.
1330040	1334200	Hulk Hogan's daughter was like, this script is below me. I'm not going to do it. And then
1334920	1339320	I got fired and then they kept making the movie and then I was unfired and then I was refired.
1339320	1345640	It was just like continual panic attacks. So when you see a shitty shark movie,
1345640	1351160	it's not because they weren't trying. It's because one person was trying and everyone else wasn't.
1352920	1354360	You were the guy that was trying yourself.
1354360	1359560	I was. We had, we're splitting an internet connection eight ways. And I was hired into
1359560	1365480	a position two levels above my competency, which at the time it was minimal, but this was,
1366360	1371960	Hey Adam, you've you've been in charge of dozens of dollars before. Where are we shooting? I don't
1371960	1376840	know. What was the, what was your position on the shark? I was production coordinator. I thought it
1376840	1381960	was going to be a session. I was no, it's production manager. I thought I was getting hired on as
1381960	1387560	associate PC. Is this you just nailing a phony baloney resume or I was like, Hey,
1387560	1393480	my friend's making a skiing movie. You want to do it? And like, I guess I'm not doing anything.
1394280	1401320	Welcome to production manager. I'm like, Oh no. Oh no. I don't know. I don't want to,
1401320	1406760	I don't want to talk to you or anything. You have a, you have a, you're a mover and a shaker.
1406760	1411320	I got a feeling you ended up in a situation where you were over your head by your own design.
1411320	1415640	Like you got, you got what you bargained for. It's like, I got more than I bargained for.
1415640	1419240	You slip into the back doors of Limbo's and you're like, yeah, I know Ben Vereen.
1419240	1422520	Like, like, like, you're just kind of like Ben Vereen.
1422520	1426440	Is that like a, for those keeping track of it, I'm Quincy and Ben Vereen.
1427240	1434680	Are the, are the owning my age. You know, when you read Salinger, you probably have to look
1434680	1445720	shit up too. He's worth it. I can't do it. We just got defensively high roaded on the Ben Vereen
1445720	1450440	reference. Nothing would be worse than me, than your, your creepy uncle trying to be like,
1450440	1455560	Hey, what's going on with Pokemon? There's so many Pokemon now. I can't,
1455560	1460600	I feel old when it's like, it used to be not very many Pokemon. Now there are very many Pokemon.
1461720	1465400	It's, you got to catch them all, right? I can't, I wanted to, I don't have,
1465400	1468600	I run a business now. I got to hire someone to catch my Pokemon.
1468600	1472600	All right. Let's have a historic happy ending for an Adam Goldberg appearance and thank him
1472600	1481880	for coming up. Thank you. Adam Goldberg. Thank you, brother. I have, I would have had more
1481880	1485720	questions for him, but we have, we have a lot of talent in the show tonight. We have too much show
1485720	1490920	tonight. There's too much show. Too much energy, too much, too much entertainment in store for them.
1492360	1495960	They're gonna, it's going to be coming up over the top. There's going to be a meniscus. I think
1495960	1500520	that our show, the amount they're going to have to go like this on the top of the show before they
1500520	1504760	carry it to the table. If you try to pick this show up across the table, it's going to end up
1504760	1507880	in your lap. Yeah. You're going to have to, as gross as it is for your friends, you're going to
1507880	1512040	have to slurp from the top of the, of the show before you give it to them. And I think that our
1512040	1517800	show naturally counterbalances the lack of lighting that we have now. I think we put, we put more show
1517800	1522120	on the stage because it's just the one autopsy light. The weird, the weird, the weird secondary
1522120	1525880	effect of this diffuse kind of lighting that's made for shooting is that I can't see anybody in
1525880	1529640	the audience as usual, except for everyone in the front row who are lit like the, uh,
1529640	1535800	the Kryptonian tribunal. Exactly. They look like they're going to, they're going to sentence me to
1535800	1542040	the Phantom zone or be sentenced to the Phantom zone. I don't know. Uh, it was the same thing in
1542040	1545720	San Francisco at County club. There was this balcony and all the people were strangely lit
1545720	1551320	in the front row of the balcony. There were these people sitting above you. Can we, can we all get
1551320	1564440	up here? I have a question for you. What have you wrought? Hey, how's it going? Because it's lit
1564440	1570120	this way because of the good news that you're shooting your, uh, comedy fufu, uh, laser, laser
1570120	1574920	bomb show. We're doing the comedy fufu laser bomb show for comedy central. Uh, no, we're doing the
1574920	1580040	meltdown, which I host with John array every week and we're doing it for TV. So I apologize. The
1580040	1584520	lighting looks great. We're doing the hacky riffing the set thing and we did it poorly and it's right.
1584520	1589400	No, it's great. Can I say something? Again, I'm going to piss. I was talking to Gorley back there
1589400	1596120	and I was like, it is, if you're in a position to fire Adam Goldberg, can you even bring yourself
1596120	1602680	to not do it? Like, and then Gorley said they probably hired him again to fire him again.
1602680	1611800	Like, can you, if you got fired him from this, how great would it feel? No offense, bro. The thing
1611800	1616760	is we, the thing is theoretically we should be able to fire him, but we can't. It felt like they
1616760	1621480	didn't fire him enough. It was like, no one was great. They were having a bad week. They're like,
1621480	1627720	that day I fired Adam Goldberg. I knew I did something right that day. I think that's what
1627720	1631800	heroin must be like. It just this feeling of serotonin pouring down my spine. You're just
1631880	1637720	trying to reclaim the first time you fired under any pretext. Get him back in my office.
1637720	1643400	And the people don't know this, but I gotta get that fix back. Yeah. Okay. You, you fired
1643400	1647240	Adam Goldberg in the beginning because it feels good. Then you just do it to feel like yourself.
1647240	1653320	But, but you know, but then you, but then you're, you're chasing that dragon. It's
1653320	1657720	never as good. It's never as good. I can't, I can't even, I can't even get through the day
1657720	1665400	with that fire. I gotta fall asleep with the wheel and I OD on firing Adam Goldberg. I died
1665400	1670120	with a smile on my face. But the problem is he'd also be your drug dealer. He like,
1671160	1675560	you'd have to rely on him to show up and like, you have to hang out with him at a bar and shit.
1679160	1684680	Your, your segment is over. Remember the happy ending? Yeah. I know. I know. We're just
1684680	1689480	fucking with you because it's hilarious. The fun of it. I did laugh at your critters reference
1689480	1693320	because I love that movie. And that was one of the first movies that Emily and I watched together.
1693320	1699400	Critters. It's sad as your brain dies. This was among the sad things are that everything you're
1699400	1704440	referencing. This is me at 38. I would say I was going like, ah, it's a bummer that everything in
1704440	1708680	my brain that I use to make a point is now absolutely unknown to most of the people that
1708680	1714040	I'm talking to. The sadder thing is as you just witnessed at 41, I couldn't quite think of the
1714040	1720040	word critters anymore. Now that's going away. I should embrace that and just become 16 again and
1720040	1724680	go like, well, well, you know, just get into fucking, uh, lady booboo or whatever they're
1724680	1734120	listening to and like make it's an invitation. Lady booboo. I think it's Miley gaga. Lady booboo.
1734920	1740520	Ironically, or it's appropriate. The only young hip reference you know is the show you created.
1744040	1749560	That's the only, and that's getting old. No, it's not. It's good that it got old. Guys,
1750280	1753160	it died young. You would have hate it sent me a link. I didn't get a chance to listen to it
1753160	1757240	because I was in the car that Ben Folds, Ben Folds made a song about community or something.
1757240	1760920	Made a song about community. Yeah. No, Ben Folds, uh, he did it. Yeah. For the
1760920	1768440	ass crack banded episode, he did a, uh, a really great, uh, uh, low rent Leonard Cohen, like, uh,
1769400	1775000	song. Like I, I got to, I got to talk to Ben Folds on the, uh, on the phone and, and talked
1775000	1779560	to him about the concept. And then he, he did this thing and one of our writers, Eric Summers,
1779560	1787240	just sent him like 80 paragraphs of, of lyrics areas about dropping coins into ass cracks.
1787240	1794920	And I think he literally put all of them into this incredibly shamefully toe tapping song. Like,
1795000	1797800	like, like, it's just like, it's got all these hooks to it. And it's like,
1797800	1804600	it's about, uh, an ass crack banded that puts quarters down your butt. Uh, and I, uh, but I,
1804600	1809560	I also, I, I, you know, I, I jumped on the opportunity. Aaron's a big fan of, uh, Ben Folds
1809560	1817160	bigger, bigger fan than me, certainly a better fan than me. Uh, and, uh, so I, I, I, I fanagled
1817160	1823640	an opportunity to go to dinner with him. And, uh, and I would say, I don't think it's premature to
1823640	1831720	say that we're friends. Did you invite Aaron to? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, but she's just sending
1831720	1836760	her pictures of you guys hanging out. The weird thing is that I think because I don't want to
1836760	1843880	overanalyze or suffocate this new, uh, relationship that I'm, that is just blooming. But I think that
1843880	1848440	the fact that I know nothing about music and that, and that he doesn't really know he's not a writer,
1848440	1853080	like is allowing us to be really pretentious with each other in texts and like instant messages and
1853080	1858280	things. So I could go like, what do you mean you're practicing your concerto? And, uh, and,
1858280	1862920	and he can be like, well, he doesn't have to worry because he's not talking to Warren Zevon or
1862920	1871320	something. And for a good reason, Warren Zevon. Great reference. Did you die writing that down?
1871320	1879000	Did you die in 1976? Yeah. That new song werewolves of London. That's burning up the charts, right?
1879960	1884040	I thought that was a pretty good stab at somebody that might intimidate Ben Full. Well, he's dead,
1884040	1889880	but yeah, I gotcha. I thought I did a good job. I don't want to Goldberg you guys. Let me just,
1889880	1895240	let me just yell out over your having fun mocking me. I'd like to, I want to challenge you to see
1895240	1903240	how obscure 70s, 80s you can go. Warren Zevon is like, is awesome. Yeah. He's like, that was great.
1903240	1907560	He knew he was going to die. He got lung cancer and they were like, you have like a couple months.
1907560	1911720	So he recorded his last album. It's called the wind knowing he was going to die. And he's like,
1911720	1915720	all right, well, this is the last thing I'm going to make. And it's awesome. It's full of joy and
1915720	1919880	like really funny. And he has like a bunch of his friends on it. Bruce Springsteen's on it. It's a
1919880	1924840	fucking great album. The wind. Listen to it. Who's the guy that, that turned down that, that gig?
1926920	1928440	I think Ben Folds turned it down.
1929400	1929800	Yeah.
1933640	1935480	Nah, man. Kiss doesn't get the joke.
1938280	1940040	Kiss doesn't relate to mortality.
1941160	1944280	Kiss lives forever. I don't understand what you say in your diet.
1944280	1947400	Why would it come to sing on your album? He was a demon.
1948840	1950360	If you're dying, it's probably my doing.
1952440	1956360	He, when he found out he was going to die, he held a press conference and this is before casino
1956360	1961000	Royale came out. And he said in his press conference, I just want to live long enough to
1961000	1967480	see the new bond movie. I hear they're taking it in a new direction. And they did. Casino Royale
1967480	1972680	was great. Wow. Yeah. And with that statement, he took press conferences and death in a new
1972680	1978760	direction. That is a new way to handle going out. And then they, all the people at the bond film
1978760	1982840	like guys, did you hear that press conference? We better take this in a new direction. They're
1983240	1989160	all standing there with Roger Moore and an alligator puppet. And they're like, fuck.
1991480	1993640	Yeah. Daniel Corey, get in the gym right now.
1995160	1998840	Somebody call a casting director. Get Pierce Brosnan out of here.
2001160	2007080	Speaking of, speaking of bond obsession. Yeah. If you've never met a guy with a bigger bond boner,
2008600	2012120	if you have, I'd like to meet him. No, I wouldn't. I don't want to meet him with a bigger bond boner.
2012200	2017880	I don't want, look, everybody. This is the worst intro of all time.
2020520	2025560	He's already killed on stage and he hasn't been on yet. This is, if you haven't listened to the
2025560	2029320	Super Ego podcast, he's one of the geniuses behind that. And I've known him since seventh grade.
2029320	2040280	And he's my dear friend, Matt Gorley, everybody. Hi, everybody.
2041160	2046200	I'm as big a Warren Zevon fan as I am a James Bond. Really? And my girlfriend just bought me a
2046200	2051000	Warren Zevon album for Christmas. Which album? The Lawyers, Guns, and Money. We're an excitable boy.
2052200	2055320	My God. And you guys are back. I'm back there and you're talking about it. And I'm just going.
2057400	2060440	Well, we're going to, we're going to take a turn now. We're going to talk about Pokemon. Oh,
2061320	2066440	what do you think? Ben Vereen. Is that your favorite Pokemon, Ben Vereen? Yeah. What's,
2066520	2074200	what are his powers? Pippin and, uh, Robert Guillaume. By the way, every single thing you've
2074200	2078520	talked about on stage, I, I, it was like a laundry list of things that I've been thinking
2078520	2083880	about today. Like the Uber thing. Really? Yeah. Uh, the Uber thing, the Facebook thing, Quincy
2083880	2090360	fucking fuck Southwest. Um, but the Uber thing, uh, I, oh, I hate that too. They're like trying so
2090360	2095160	hard to get, first of all, it's very hard to complain about a thing that a lot of people
2095160	2099960	can't afford. And you literally, I've made a sort of, uh, cottage industry out of that. Sure.
2100920	2105800	But you're also literally complaining about people opening too many doors for you. I know. I know. I
2105800	2109960	know. I should, I should, I should have called this segment, like things I can't complain about,
2109960	2114360	blah, blah, blah, but I wanted to change it up. But, but I mean, fuck it. You gotta, you gotta
2114360	2117400	own it. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to, I'm going to find a good charity. I'm going
2117400	2121640	to start giving the fuck to it. And then I'm going to complain about that. Like I'll, something,
2121640	2124920	something I can do to high road people. I can go like, Hey, how many people have you fed this
2124920	2128840	week? Yeah. But I agree with you. Cause I think they're like Christ, they want to like try and
2128840	2133560	talk. I was like, I'll give you five stars just for not talking to me. Like don't make an effort.
2133560	2141080	And I don't want to found sound xenophobic, but bond villains from the Uber driver, all their names,
2141080	2148680	their names are core. Yeah. Old, old guard. Yeah. I'm not joking. I had an Uber driver named
2148680	2155720	stub North. We got it. We're going to start this tumbler block before somebody else does
2156360	2161560	Uber driver names. I take screen captures of them. I got Gore, Olga, Olga,
2163240	2170360	who was a young, very handsome guy. I got a T-Hoss. Oh yeah. I've had T-Hoss. That's lift.
2172680	2174200	Pig Latin for a bond villain.
2179320	2185240	I couldn't tell if that was a last name or a share or a guy who's had a long day and
2185240	2191560	he has one joy and it's, it is coming up with a hilarious new name. There's a lot of, uh,
2191560	2195800	what looks like Karen, but I think they would prefer you pronounce it Karen. That's a, like a
2195800	2201720	guy. Oh, really? I don't know if that's an Armenian, uh, are they all like, like, like central,
2201720	2206040	like Eastern European types? There's a lot of Armenian, a lot of Eastern European. And I had
2206040	2211880	this guy yesterday. His name was Eddic, like Eric, but with a D instead of the R because fuck
2211880	2218760	everybody. And he was so sinister. He was like, you have to, he was like, you have to give me
2218760	2223800	five star. Uh, last week, my rating, the deactivated made my rating was too low.
2223800	2226760	And he kept asking me like, how are you doing my friend? Like he was like,
2227480	2234040	he keeps like every stop, but he keeps looking over and he goes, just, uh, ask me, do, do you,
2234040	2240680	you expect me to talk? I'm not going to say it. I was just like, do you expect me to, to get you
2240680	2248840	to your destination? I expect me to drive. But speaking of which, that brings up an interesting
2248840	2253480	point because I was also like, I kept going. One of my other complaints about Uber, which I've now
2253560	2258280	dropped was that you, the whole appeal of this thing is that it's an app. It's not a cab. You
2258280	2264440	hit a button, they come get you. They're like a drone, you know, like, like, and, and, and, and I
2264440	2272360	kept complaining because every time I did it, hello, it's, it's, it's Goron. Uh, uh, where do you,
2272360	2276600	what, uh, what, what address are you on? Yeah. And you do want to pick up a thing. Yeah. This is
2276600	2281560	sounding a lot like a conversation between me and a cab driver at this point. Uh, and, and, and I was
2281560	2285960	like, ah, why, why do they have to do that? And then, uh, my friend Wade Randolph, Rick and Morty
2285960	2290760	writers said, uh, you know why they do that? Because in New York recently at New Year's Eve,
2292120	2296200	now it's like, this is the thing about what, like, like, let's segue into this conversation.
2296200	2301000	This, this brave new world with all the apps that are revolutionizing capitalism. They're also like
2301000	2305400	kind of, I mean, they're a little unregulated. It's the wild west and there's fucking,
2305400	2309160	there's crazy shit happening. It's like, it's like gangs in New York with the fire departments,
2309160	2316600	like the, um, I think it was Uber that had the blood on its hands. Uber did this to lift.
2317240	2324040	They, uh, New Year's Eve, they had a bunch of people just order lifts and send them to remote
2324040	2330360	locations where there was no passenger. So the only person getting fucked over is, is, is the
2330360	2335800	driver who's, who's makes no money and how has all these canceled fares. And they just, they just
2335800	2340840	did this. This is what I heard. I don't know. Google it and correct me on Twitter. I saw like a
2340840	2344680	teaser for a piece of that in CNN and I didn't get to see it, but there was a little hubbub about it.
2344680	2349160	So when the guy calls you and says, are you really there? Like that's not, that's how I perceive it.
2349160	2354600	Now I'm like, yes, I am, buddy. I am. I'm here a little bit headquarters. I mean, Dan,
2355880	2360680	I'm always going to be here. Okay. I'm never going to go away. Are you going to break my heart?
2361560	2365560	But I don't understand when I hear that story, I don't quite understand how
2366520	2370840	calling you and verifying you could still be an imposter. Yeah. Yeah. If you're enough of an
2370840	2377960	asshole to take money from a, from a, from a, from a web 3.0 limo service and still at the
2377960	2384760	empire state building, swear to God center. Matter of fact, my foot's bleeding now.
2385640	2390120	Like why, you know, why not pay my driver never came. Your driver stub norts. Yeah, sure.
2391320	2394520	I, it's what his name is. Stop North.
2397880	2405160	Nice fella. I spell it for me against double be just like it sounds. What is the most common
2405160	2411320	spelling of step north? Is he Hungarian? What is that? I don't know. I didn't, we didn't have that.
2412760	2419960	STU B N O R T Z. Fucking right on. Well, I'm on that topic though, about drivers getting fucked
2419960	2424280	over because of this new convenient thing where we're all having guys open doors for us. Just one
2424280	2429000	more thing. This is how I offset my white people problems. Like complaints is by sticking up for
2429000	2432680	the fucking man and saying, fuck the system. And before I go home to my mansion and jerk off into
2432680	2441400	a laptop. There was an article about somebody went undercover and went to went and worked at Amazon
2441400	2447400	at one of their warehouses. Oh, I heard about this. Yeah. And I have, this is all second hand. I, I,
2447400	2451400	I don't read anything. I get all my news from someone in a writer's room who read something.
2451400	2455800	And I just trust them. Yeah. Yeah. But they were talking about this article. This person goes
2455800	2462360	undercover and works for a while at Amazon and it, and, and describes it as being like this insane
2462360	2468360	Orwellian prison where, because the technology now allows them to track their workers with,
2468360	2476120	with laser precision GPS and, and, and, and, and hold them accountable to every second of their
2476120	2480920	time. Like, like, like you have 30 seconds to make this delivery, like, like, like get this bin
2480920	2485800	over to that bin. And if you, every second over 30 seconds comes out of your pay or something,
2485800	2489960	stuff that makes you wonder how could this possibly be fair? And I guess the answer is just because,
2489960	2496360	well, who money's changing hands and we're not. Someone was telling me at Disney world or
2496360	2500840	Disneyland, I know Amanda used to work there. I did too for 13. Oh, you did. Someone told me,
2501800	2507000	somebody was working there and they said that they, every day they rank every single employee
2507000	2512440	in the theme park. And so you, but literally everyone. I didn't know that. Yeah. That's like
2512440	2517960	an IMDB ranking where they're star meter. It's kind of like 12 years a slave a little bit. Like,
2517960	2526200	that's what they did in that movie. They took them to Disneyland. I stopped. It ends well.
2526200	2534200	Yeah. It's a right call. It's a very small world. It's a cage.
2540920	2548280	Going for it to get on a headline. Stop making slave jokes. I'm not jumping on you. I'm just
2548280	2552280	saying like, we're all, we're all in bad. We're all in trouble here. Oh yeah. And our riffing.
2552280	2555560	You know, all four of us are going through ride puns for slavery.
2555560	2564520	I've got one from his no space mountain. I'm not doing it. I'll get in so much trouble.
2564520	2571720	I'm not doing just cause I can't think of one. I've got five how we deal with trauma
2571720	2577720	hundreds of years after we wouldn't have suffered through it anyway. I would be racist. I just don't
2577720	2588520	know how. Have you guys been on the underground Matterhorn? It saved a lot of people.
2590600	2598760	A lot of Yetis are saved. I have four more. I'm going to piece them out throughout the show.
2598760	2604920	Okay. I will say this. I changed my Facebook profile to like a comedian profile. Here we go.
2604920	2609800	Friends to fans. This is what I needed. It ruined Facebook for me. Everything stopped working.
2611240	2616440	Nobody emails me there anymore. My wall is fucked. Cause your friends are like, fuck you.
2617240	2621720	Well, I don't even know it converted them, but now it's different. So it's not like a back and
2621720	2626680	forth. It's like, they can say stuff to me, but I can't really, it's weird. It's more like a bulletin
2626680	2631880	board than like a thing that I can really do. Can you do two things where you're just like a
2631880	2637960	regular guy or you have your Clark Kent, uh, you can limit your privacy settings down to only
2637960	2643400	people that you say absolutely. And you don't have to allow the, uh, the entire world. It's split
2643400	2647480	mine. I have two profiles and I don't know what to do with either one. Cause I had the one and I
2647480	2651160	converted it and now I have two. And I don't know if the other one is an old version of me or if it's
2651160	2657560	someone else pretending to be me. We're going to, we're going to clean up this internet, man.
2658280	2662200	Yeah. It's a, we're going to get some kind of government to eliminate the neutrality of this
2662200	2670840	thing. That's crazy stuff. I, I, it's too, I, I, we need to get a net neutrality guy and I, I, I,
2670840	2675880	Aaron has a friend who, uh, is passionate about this stuff. Eddie Geller, I think his name is,
2675880	2679880	uh, uh, we gotta, we gotta, we gotta, we gotta get some net neutrality people out here. I gotta
2679880	2684680	get invested in that stuff too. I gotta grow up. I'm 41 years old. I gotta stop. I gotta stop
2684680	2689320	complaining about, uh, uh, I don't have to stop complaining about how much it hurts to jerk off
2689320	2693960	and, uh, and, and how hard it is to have doors open for me, but I have to, I have to add to that
2693960	2700280	and add some responsibility to that. Why does, wait, sorry. We have, we have jerk off questions.
2700280	2703720	We have, okay. We have follow-ups. Hi, Matt Gorley, Newsweek magazine.
2703720	2714200	Uh, why, why, why does it hurt to jerk off follow-up question? Why am I asking this?
2715320	2719560	I was, I was, I was being hyperbolic and, and thinking of the most ridiculous thing that you
2719560	2723480	can ever complain about would be, it would be how much it hurts to jerk off. Cause I, ostensibly
2724520	2728520	the answer to the question would be that you jerked off so much. I haven't experienced this
2728520	2734040	since I was like 21. Yeah. Where, where it's just like Sunday afternoon and you're just like,
2734040	2738760	more? All right. Yeah. I'd like to see the rest of my time to my distinguished colleagues. Let's,
2738760	2746840	let's go till nothing comes out. Um, you said you were jerking off into your laptop. Is that why
2746840	2756520	Aaron got you a waterproof thing for your iPad? Again, it's just, it's all hyperbolic language and
2756520	2761080	yeah, but many a truth is sudden jest, Dan. Well, I mean, you're a racist then.
2766200	2773080	No, Disneyland is with their new ride. Uh, I don't have any shit. He said he had four more.
2773880	2779560	There was a Pirates of the Caribbean one that I backed off on because it got weird. Uh, what?
2779560	2785720	Lash Mountain. Lash Mountain. Okay. Now it's getting too dark. All right. That's it.
2785720	2792520	Wait, why, why, why was, why is this Disneyland ranking people like this is what I heard. I don't
2792520	2798280	know. Like, like Dan, I hear facts and then I take them to be true and then spread them and then add
2798280	2804360	to them. And so just please cut out the stuff where I'm not sure about this. Um, just to,
2804360	2809400	just so that you see like, Oh, I'm only 135. I got to get up top. And then there's certain people
2809400	2814440	who are go getters who are like higher up. So you like get a thing like, like you were 200 today.
2814440	2817720	That's not good. Don't you want to be higher than that? Like that kind of stuff. Do you know,
2817720	2822600	are they, is it people voting for each other or? No, it's cause they can track like how much work
2822600	2826760	you've done and all this stuff. But I mean, how are they measuring and how are they comparing like
2826760	2833560	the guy that sells the ostrich legs to the guy that's running the roller coaster? Okay. I would
2833560	2839240	have to go talk to the person who I don't, I don't even remember who it was. It could have been a
2839240	2845960	dream I once had. Yeah. I don't remember this. They never like would come up to you and pin a
2845960	2852040	little number on your chest. Okay. You can do better Jim. Come on. We should have a segment
2852040	2857480	of people. I get corrected all the time. I get, I get, I say five horribly erroneous things and
2857480	2862360	pass them off. Yeah. I made the mistake of looking at the internet and like you get corrected on
2862360	2866920	every little bloody thing. We miss, we misspeak all the time. You should try doing a James Bond
2866920	2871880	podcast. Those people do not let a thing go by. What's it, what's it called again? James Bonding.
2871880	2875960	James Bonding. Yeah. Oh, I can imagine they come after you. Actually you should not try doing it.
2875960	2879800	But I will say this, there's another side to that culture. Like, like, it's like this emerging
2879800	2884840	internet age. I think I feel like Reddit is the, represents it the most, like a personality wise,
2884840	2888280	you know, every, we've talked about how every social, every social platform has its own
2888280	2896600	personality. Tumblr is a, is a very like a passionate young lady and, and, and, and Reddit,
2896600	2904200	and Reddit is a very stoic guy in a Vulcan costume who's, who's playing 3d chess with,
2904200	2908600	with someone. And I didn't mean to get gender specific there, but I'll hear about that on both
2908600	2913560	of those platforms in very different ways. Yes. Well, one, they'll both address it in their own
2913560	2922360	way. Instagram is a cat. Yeah, I'll say that. My, my account is. But Reddit, Reddit, Reddit has
2922360	2926680	it like, like, like, like, like, so, so for instance of like, like, if I'm up here spouting
2926680	2930520	nonsense and I go like, you know, did you hear what happened in Columbia? Oh, these five guys
2930520	2935160	got chainsawed, but Cobra ate them and Amazon was responsible and blah, blah, blah. I just blah,
2935160	2939080	blah, blah. And I'm drunk and I go home and I sleep like a baby. I get up and look on Twitter and
2939080	2943720	people correct me. And there's, there's a, there's a curator personality that has a higher sense of
2943720	2948040	social and informational responsibility. These are good people. These are people who protect us
2948040	2952600	historically from people like churches that are going to burn women at the stake and things like
2952600	2958600	that. It's a logic skepticism. Don't, don't, don't go off half cocked and like, like, however,
2959480	2966440	like the other side of that is this dumb Starbucks thing. There's a, I went to the Reddit thread
2966440	2974920	discussing dumb Starbucks and it was like, it was eight pages of just a bunch of people not
2974920	2980200	able to have fun with like the simplest thing in the world. I don't know what's going on. I think,
2980200	2985000	I think their point is that privacy laws overlaps with everything. Well, that's not true. If they
2985000	2988680	were making that point, then that wouldn't be a way to make that point. I think if it's parody,
2988680	2992520	that's an incorrect use of those. It's just, it's just everybody gathering around this thing and
2992520	2997720	failing to, that's just a, whatever it is. I don't know if it's Nathan for you or Banksy or
2997720	3001240	whoever the fuck it is, but somebody's telling a joke. Somebody's just putting dumb in front of
3001240	3007160	Starbucks and, and, and, and, and that's basically it. You can, you can have all levels of fun with
3007160	3012040	that, but you definitely are never going to digest that with the enzymes of intellectual logical
3012040	3016200	discussion. And they actually missed out on something, but I also feel like the correcting,
3016200	3020760	even if it's not like that, like I do a video game podcast and that I bet rivals, you know,
3021160	3026440	maybe even more, we'll be like, oh, super Mario 3d world on the game boy advanced and
3026440	3031160	10 people. Like, actually that was on game boy color. Like, what is anybody gaining from that?
3031160	3034920	I'm sorry. We miss both. It's, it's something that's written in the tweets. It's the tone,
3034920	3041480	but I heard Goldberg correcting what I just said. Goldberg is one of the, he's like cyber Christ.
3041480	3047880	He brings, like, he, he brings the phenomenon of getting corrected on Twitter into real life.
3047880	3050200	Can we call this show cyber Christ and stub norts?
3052040	3057080	Cyber Christ, stub norts, cyber Christ and stub norts. And then we have to actually write a play
3058120	3062360	for our hundreds upcoming show. We're going to do a live play called cyber Christ and stub norts.
3064760	3068520	Okay. It'll be okay. What if we could track down stub norts? Like,
3068520	3072200	is there a way to request a driver or something on Uber? I don't, I don't know.
3072200	3077240	You got to request a specific one because that's the thing is like, by the way, this happened once,
3077240	3083560	but this was in this city. Sorry, go ahead. Uber thing. Um, Emily got a person, Emily and I
3083560	3088120	were hanging out. She got an Uber driver. He dropped her home. He called her, talked to her,
3088120	3092680	and then she texted me like, I'm home. The door's unlocked to me. But she, by mistake,
3092680	3098280	texted the Uber driver and she noticed and she said, uh, oh, sorry, not meant for you.
3098280	3100040	And he said, no, no, I like
3107240	3117800	dumb. In our top story, two straight weeks, the Uber band. It is still at large. Women are found.
3117800	3124680	No, no, I like his board. I don't know. I like, and he knows where she lives.
3125480	3127720	She locked the door from then on out.
3128520	3133240	I, I, my, my cackle is too, is too non sympathetic.
3134760	3140760	I'm, I'm, I'm laughing at the whatever at the terror. That is a bummer. Yeah. It's a real
3140760	3145080	problem. I mean, again, this might all be bullshit too. And this might've been a smear campaign,
3145080	3148680	but wasn't it in the very early days of Uber, there was some sexual harassing going on or something
3148680	3157400	or rapes. That's, that's worse. I've never seen an Uber driver with less than a 4.5.
3157720	3161320	No, they have to give them lower than that. If that happened to you, right?
3163080	3166200	I'd reckon. What is a rape star rating these days?
3167000	3168040	I'm out. I'm out.
3169240	3171240	I'm just you guys.
3172520	3177000	Uh, the, uh, but there's a part of the system and this is another thing that kind of like,
3177000	3180680	like, well, is that this is for the consumer's benefit, but then what kind of terror are we
3180680	3188440	creating among the worker? Uh, uh, the, the, the way it works, I'm told is that if they drop
3188440	3196360	below a 4.5 or something, they get there. They can't, they can't get no Uber business no more
3196360	3204040	ever again. They're out of the club. Uh, and, and, and, and so they're terrified, which is nice for
3204040	3208840	all of us who have ever taken a cab over the last 30 years. It's a nice little slipper to put your
3208840	3213640	foot in for a change of pace, a driver coming to pick you up. Who's a little frightened that he
3213640	3219320	might not, uh, uh, satisfy you with your driving experience. That's, that's, that's a welcome,
3219320	3224120	welcome change. But then you kind of over time, you're kind of like, well, Jesus Christ, what is
3224120	3229560	this? Like, like, like I feel bad. I never give anyone less than a five. Now I feel like that's
3229560	3236680	the new tip because I'm like, well, he kind of was a four, but what am I doing? Who am I? Like,
3236680	3242760	like, what am I, am I, am I Simon Cowell? Like, I, uh, so what do I know about driving fucking five?
3242760	3249160	You tried, you'd give it your shot. It's uh, anyways, I'm done talking. So the only rating
3249160	3254040	you can give them is either a five or a rating that would get them fired. Yeah. Uh, that's the
3254040	3259480	second highest rating you can give them. Well, well, I know it's average in a theoretical sense.
3259480	3263160	Yeah, I guess we need a mathematician to come up here and, but, but, but, but yeah, you're,
3263160	3266200	you would be giving them a number that if everyone else gave them that number,
3266600	3270840	they would be gone. It kind of does it, but I think, I guess they figured that into their
3270840	3275640	algorithm that people are going to tend to give you a five. But I guess like I would not want to
3275640	3280280	give a number to someone that would get them fired. Like that's why you give them five.
3280280	3285960	Well, that's like, wait, I've never, I've never under, I've, I've, I've, I have had horrible,
3285960	3289880	uh, people wait on me in restaurants. We all have, we all have, they've been busy. They've,
3289880	3294440	they've been bad people. They've been bad at their job. I've, I, I've never crossed a threshold
3294440	3299320	where I'm like, here's your dollar for your tip. Like I always just like, I just go, okay,
3299320	3303560	because I've seen too many goddamn monologues and reservoir dogs and all this shit about,
3303560	3308200	you know, that it's part, they get taxed and all this stuff and it's hard for them. And it's like,
3308200	3314840	I'm not going to carry that, that relationship into finance. So I'm tipping you 20%, even though
3314840	3320200	you suck. And I just hate you because you suck, but here's your 20% and it becomes systematized.
3320200	3323320	That's to say like, here's your five stars. You were 10 minutes late. And
3324120	3328840	boy, I'm, I'm, I'm really not care about something. I'm not like blowing anybody's mind by saying
3328840	3332920	like, like you, like we've talked about before, like you have a lot of, uh, instant crisis,
3332920	3336280	like, like, uh, sensation when you're talking with, when you're dealing with strangers or even
3336280	3339880	with people that aren't strangers, like, uh, but to the extent that somebody is a stranger and
3339880	3344040	there is a transaction that has to happen. Right. And I talked about this on Ali Georgia, uh,
3344040	3348520	slumber party when I was, uh, when I went on that, uh, this is like, this is my Stanley rectangle in
3348520	3353960	the upper panel saying, check out that issue of Hulk. Um, you know, he fought the Submariner.
3354600	3362040	Um, that's, that's why he's calling him, uh, fish face. Uh, they've met before. Um, the, uh, I, I,
3363240	3373720	explain it some more, Dan. Um, the, uh, name more, the, you just, you just, that's the name of the
3373720	3380200	guy. I'm sorry. Continue. Can I leave? I know, I know his name is Prince. I'm offended, but
3382840	3395560	anyways, uh, actually it's Prince name. Um, um, uh, the, I, I'm at my house in Los Feliz.
3396200	3403640	I order an Uber. It's like ordering honey in a beehive. There's a lot of black cars in Los
3403640	3411480	Feliz. Uh, there's a lot of, uh, uh, limo drivers living in my neighborhood and, uh, and, and, and if
3411480	3418920	one of them's bad, I, he's not only my neighbor, but he's bad and I can't, I'm stuck in a horrible
3418920	3421720	position. He has your credit card information. He knows where you live. He knows where you live. I
3421720	3426120	don't think, yeah, I don't, I don't extend it even way before that. I don't think he's going to knife
3426120	3431400	my dog or steal money from my electronic. I don't think it's like hackers or something. I'm just
3431400	3437960	saying like, I can't socially, I can't, I'm going to see him again. Yeah. And it, does he know that
3437960	3446440	I gave him a, that I'm, they do know weighing his life on, on, on, on, on, uh, ISIS's scales.
3448680	3453320	They rate you too. Do they? Yeah. You get a rating too. So will they not pick you up after a while?
3453320	3457240	Yeah. If they don't, they can see like, nah, I don't want to, I don't want this person. They're
3457240	3463160	only a 4.5. Yeah. Is this your Disney thing again? Do you, can you back this up? This is what one of,
3463160	3468840	one of the stub norts has told me. One of them? Yeah. You know, those people.
3471480	3475480	If you're, if you're a person listening out there in podcast land and you don't know what dumb
3475480	3481080	Starbucks is and your city's not big enough to have Uber and uh, and you don't know who Ben Vereen is,
3481080	3489640	I'm very sorry, but fuck you. A lot of, we're, we're on like our 89th episode of free entertainment.
3489640	3495000	You fucking asshole, Michael. Just keep chopping your carrots, you little bitch. Yeah.
3496920	3501880	You'll fucking get over it next week. There's a guy named Michael who didn't get any other
3501880	3507480	jokes, who's eating carrots, listening to this, and you just blew his mind. We were talking about
3507480	3512520	that. Like if you just took that one, like, like, like, if you, you have a, you have a TV show, a
3512520	3516120	basic cable and you just, I think we were talking about the Rick and Morty's room or faith healers
3516120	3520440	do that where you just like, you just look out at the camera and just go, Hey, Todd, that's how I'm
3520440	3525800	sorry. We're talking about having Rick, like just look at the camera at one point and like, uh, oh,
3525800	3529640	because we were talking about how people on all of our Reddit where there was a recent episode of
3529640	3533400	Rick and Morty where there was so many people that were recommending you gotta get, you gotta watch
3533400	3537880	Rick and Morty, but you gotta get high, man. You gotta get high. And then we did this episode where
3537880	3542520	Morty ends up burying his dead self from another timeline in the backyard so he can take his place
3542520	3546840	and Mazzy stars look on down from the bridges playing as an MOS shot of him walking through
3546840	3551720	his house, observing a life that he does not belong to him, but that no one will ever notice
3551720	3555720	that he's, he's injured. And it was amazing. The amount of people over the internet were like,
3555720	3561400	okay, don't get high. I told you to get high when he wants a show, man. I'm telling you not to get
3561400	3566840	high. My friend's dead. Okay. So, so we were joking about how we're like, like Rick could be
3566840	3571400	talking to the scene. He's like, I'm telling you, Morty, it's, uh, you know, uh, we gotta go to a
3571400	3575800	different dimension, Morty, and it's going to be fucked up. I don't recommend you get high, Todd
3575800	3583240	Johnson. And just look into the, look at the camera and then it's just like ride that statistical
3584120	3588840	like, okay, there's 2 million people maybe watching and it's like Todd Johnson eating your
3588840	3595480	peas or like, like, just fuck him up forever. I watch a lot of, I watch a lot of religious
3595480	3600440	television late at night and the faith healers on there, it's just good. There's no better TV,
3601320	3607400	exception included. Um, you, they will do things like the, the faith healer will look at the camera
3607400	3611960	and say there's, there's a woman named Marjorie out there and she has a type of lung cancer and
3611960	3616040	I'm going to focus on her right now. And he wins either way. Of course, it falls on a Marjorie
3616040	3621000	that has lung cancer or everybody out there is believing that there's a, that's like, that's like
3621000	3625240	cold reading except for no risk. That's like, that's like, that's cheating. I never even thought
3625240	3629000	about that. Of course you could do that though. They used to do that on like romper room. My mom
3629000	3633480	told me about that. She said like there would be like a magnifying glass that they would pick up
3633480	3638520	and, uh, and look through it and they'd go, Lisa, I could see Lisa. I can see Tony, Tony,
3638520	3642680	stop picking on your sister. So I guess that's nothing new until you start fucking charging
3642680	3647480	for it. Who's the guy who was on TV and it was like crossing the bridge or something like that
3647480	3652760	crossing over. John Edwards. Yeah. And he would be like, um, I could send someone. Oh, he's here.
3652760	3657400	His name starts with a T and I always imagined like the ghosts are there, but they don't even
3657400	3661480	want to talk to these assholes. You know, they're like, what's your name? It's something with a T
3661480	3668360	you douchebag. I really, I was listening to the radio the other day and someone was, it was a
3668360	3672200	numerologist on, and this is going to sort of reveal maybe how close-minded I am, but he was
3672200	3677160	talking about like, if you take your birth date and you multiply it by this and this, and I got so
3677160	3682040	angry listening to this guy. That's not closed-minded. That's just being sensible. Not as
3682040	3690440	close-minded as someone who listens to the radio. Give your computer a chance. It's got radio
3690440	3695480	emulators on it. He's just mad at you because it sounds smart Camille. I just didn't get it.
3696600	3701560	It just bugged me so much. That's crazy. Because I do think these psychics are like,
3701560	3706040	they're preying on people who are in moments of weakness. That's what they do.
3706040	3710840	I think that's a really interesting point because it's like, guys are my position. So if somebody
3710840	3716440	ever tells me I'm not allowed to, that I have some accountability, when someone tweets at me
3716440	3723400	or it says like, you made a polio joke on your show last night. You need to not. I'm offended
3723400	3728120	on all this stuff. My instant reaction is to go, go fuck yourself. You're watching TV wrong. You
3728200	3735480	don't take it so seriously and all this stuff. But I want people to care about what I'm putting out
3735480	3746120	there. There is a responsibility. Norman Lear knew that. He's an example of somebody that took
3746120	3752840	that seriously. He said, you know what? I'm making a sitcom. I can keep doing stuff the same way or
3752840	3758600	I could make a sitcom for black people because I want to. Not because I see a huge profit in it,
3758600	3763320	but because something seems wrong with what's being presented on television and we're shaping
3763320	3767640	people's brains as they're watching it. And today's three year old is tomorrow's 40 year old.
3767640	3771800	And they're all watching TV and they're all learning from it. It's like you high road that
3771800	3775960	when people are telling you what to do and you want to fall back on like, you can't tell me what
3775960	3780200	to do, freedom of speech and all that stuff. But then you also capitalize from it.
3780280	3784520	Yeah. But also sometimes like you have to take every one of those instances
3784520	3790600	at for what it is. So I do this podcast and in the intro, there was one time I had hiccups.
3790600	3794520	It was just a couple of weeks ago. It was a five minute thing. And I thought it was a funny thing.
3794520	3798920	I had hiccups and I just did a five minute thing. This one guy got really, really angry at me.
3799800	3803160	He got really, really angry at me and he kept like posting and people were like,
3803160	3807320	what the fuck is wrong with you kept posting? Like it's his responsibility to not have hiccups
3807320	3814120	when he's podcasting. I was like, literally go fuck yourself. He thought you were being
3814120	3818200	unprofessional like that. Yeah. Like you should have held off recording until you're done. He
3818200	3823800	said it grossed him out. It's fucking hiccups. Well, I mean, I'm definitely not taking that guy's
3823800	3831800	side, but it's also like, like there are people who, who like if you, the sound of a fingernail
3831800	3836120	being clipped might, might cause them to, but they should understand that then that that's,
3836920	3841800	that they bear that bird. Yeah. I, I have to live in a world where apparently everyone but me is
3841800	3846680	can't wait to see a closeup of a fucking hypodermic needle go into a goddamn arm
3846680	3852200	every single time on every TV show or a movie. Anytime there's a remote excuse to do it,
3852200	3858200	they fucking love it. I have to, I have to, I want to vomit. I can't stand needles going into vase.
3858200	3860440	And you don't like fingers being cut too, right? You have a finger.
3861000	3861960	Fingers being cut.
3864440	3868920	Does that come up a lot? Not as well. There's that, there's that, what are you doing? Oh,
3868920	3874280	scar. It's the blood coming out of the finger. That, that, that, that Dan Aykroyd sketch where
3874280	3881240	he's a Julia Childs and it's, it's spurting those gags severing kind of like, like, I, I, I can't,
3881240	3884920	I can't handle it. It'll ruin my day. And it's, I do, I do accept that. I go,
3884920	3888840	something wrong with me because everyone else is laughing. So, but there's a fucking like,
3888920	3893640	like every movie, goddamn, if it involves heroin, if it involves, if it's, if it's,
3893640	3898040	if it's fucking dream on and, and he goes and gets a flu shot, they can't, like,
3898040	3902200	why do you have to show it? What do you have to cut? I know it's coming. I'm conditioned to know
3902200	3906440	it's coming. And I, and I, and I cover my eyes like a baby. When you give blood, are you, are you
3906440	3914200	dying? I turn my head. I, I, and I start to sweat and I go, I, I, and the nurses always go,
3914200	3920520	are you okay? Because I, I, I'm having plasma sucked out of my body siphoned out of my body.
3922280	3926840	I'm freaking out talking about it. I don't, I don't like going to the doctor. I don't want
3926840	3934600	to be Jim Henson. I don't want to die. So I forced myself to go, but I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I can't,
3934600	3941640	did a doctor kill Jim Henson? No, no. He, he didn't go. He didn't go. Like if I, if I, if I didn't,
3941720	3946200	if I didn't know that that was possible, that you could just die from not fucking going and I would
3946200	3951160	just be like fine. I feel fine. It's just a cold or whatever, but I go and they, they, they, they,
3951160	3956120	they take that fucking cuff and they inflate it. I learned in health class, I know what's happening.
3956120	3962040	They, they, they're collapsing the walls of your artery. That's how they take your blood pressure.
3962040	3972040	They inflate that cuff until the walls of your artery collapse. And then they measure the amount
3972040	3979080	that they have to release it until it reinflates, allowing blood, your viscera to flow back through
3979080	3987800	your own arm. And they, they record that as a number. We're like, I always have, like, I have
3987800	3993880	very low blood pressure, like genetically, but I have normal blood pressure because the act of
3993880	3999160	taking my blood pressure makes me think I'm going to die. Then I start sweating. They go,
3999160	4004840	are you all right? And I go, just do it. Just fucking do it. And they get off on the fucking,
4007000	4011320	they love doing it. I want to, like, it would be so easy to torture me.
4011320	4018440	You could, you could torture me by making me better. Okay. That could just strap me to a
4018440	4024760	chair, but we're concerned about you. You seem, you seem, you seem, we're going to take your blood
4024760	4031000	pressure. I'll give you the blueprints to the white house. Don't take my blood pressure. I'm
4031000	4037880	going to freak out the taking of blood. I can only get through by pretending in my head and I'm, I'm,
4037880	4044520	I'm not being hyperbolic. I imagine in my head that precisely that, that I'm being interrogated
4044520	4051800	by an enemy, like that, that there is a, that there is like an empire that I'm part of a rebellion
4051800	4056280	and they're trying to get me to tell them, Todd Johnson, don't get high for this podcast right
4056280	4064440	now. I have to imagine in my head that I'm somehow, that if I just don't gel out, like, like I give up
4064440	4070440	and, and, and, and run that I'm a hero. I have to like reduce it to that, like stuff so that I,
4070440	4074200	so I just like, how do you make it through the afternoon, man? That's the worst. I don't go to
4074200	4079320	the doctor every afternoon. I'm living on a razor's edge. The stakes are so high. Everybody's got their,
4079320	4089560	got their things, man. I'm, I, mine is having fucking fluid siphoned out of my body through a
4089560	4102120	tube by a bureaucrat. So it can be sent to a lab. That's me. That's mine. Not anymore.
4104120	4111880	Siphon, you know, it's, they siphon it out of your body. They suck it and it starts to come out and
4111880	4116200	then it goes into, this is the, this is the part where Jeff goes, I love to give blood. I love it.
4116200	4119880	I love to watch it. I know, I know this about him. Siphon is my favorite word.
4121000	4123960	Uh, technically it's not siphoning. It's more of a, uh, such a,
4125400	4130680	he loves, he loves giving blood. It's so weird that when you, when I, when it happens,
4130680	4136680	I have to watch it because it's so fucking crazy. Also, uh, like I love how it's made and how do
4136680	4140280	they do it and those kinds of shows like watching how they make those needles. That's fucking
4140920	4146360	fascinating. And then, and then I go, what if we took a little pointy tube and put it in your
4146360	4153640	fucking body and then, and then your fucking stuff comes out. It's awesome. I mean, it's,
4153640	4157080	it's freaky, but like you have to look at it. It was like, I don't want to not see that. That's
4157080	4161880	crazy. Yeah. I never look, I always look away. And then, and then I just can't, I got to lay there
4161880	4165800	and then, and they're like, are you all right? I'm like, I know the last half of that statement
4165800	4173080	is are you a pussy? Like I, the answer is yes about this, but I'll tell you, I'll tell you one
4173080	4177640	thing. If you, if you, if you tell me what I can't write in my TV show, I'll fucking tell you to fuck
4177640	4182920	off. I'm strong that way. People at home should know that Dan has slowly been taking his clothes
4182920	4188360	off while it's been on the ground. It's making, it's making me lose weight thinking about this.
4188360	4192600	You actually, I'm not joking. You look a little pale and a little bit like a little sweat. You know
4192600	4196760	what? We should maybe take your blood pressure. Maybe you're okay. Is there a doctor in the house?
4198760	4202840	I, I, yeah, I am really, well, when I had that, you know, who should we should have as a guest
4202840	4209000	because she came to the show and she talked to me after the show. I, the lady that gave the,
4209000	4215560	that anesthetized me for my endoscopy. Uh, you guys weren't as impressed by that. Janice?
4215560	4224440	No, it's just, I don't know. Well, because believe me, I had to go into a whole
4224440	4231000	weird state of denial about having my first actual procedure done. I had never been knocked out.
4231960	4239960	So did you get general anesthesia? Uh, I got, I got specific to me. Yeah. He didn't get everyone in
4239960	4247240	LA. No, did you get the actual military officer general anesthesia? He comes in and he can't
4247240	4260200	afford that corporal aspirin. I had my tonsils out and I was going under and they put me on
4260200	4264600	anesthesia and it wasn't the medical process. I was afraid of, I was in a hospital where I didn't
4264600	4269080	trust them. If while I was under something went wrong, like an earthquake already, it seemed like
4269080	4276280	chaos. There was a woman across the way in her bed going, you're gonna love this. It's another
4276280	4282360	patient, another patient. What's the difference between these places and a DMV? Exactly. They
4282360	4288840	don't know what they're doing. There's no difference. Years of schooling. Okay. No difference. A couple
4288840	4293240	of years. Yeah. At least two more years than the DMV. Big deal. You know what I did with the last
4293240	4298440	two years? Jack shit. You can waste two years, man. None of you're in medical school. You gotta
4299240	4305480	add two years to the lady at the DMV and tell me that if my heart stops during my endoscopy,
4305480	4311640	they tell you, they make you sign all these forms. These are the forms say if you start to choke to
4311640	4316920	death on the tube, just you can't, you have to sign all this stuff because you can't open up your
4316920	4322920	chest and pull your lungs out. Well, no, no, no. That sounds expensive. That sounds like there's
4322920	4327320	overhead involved. You're signing the forms so that your loved ones can't sue them when you die.
4328120	4333320	That's why being, being in the hospital during passed out during an earthquake is the safest
4333320	4338920	place to be at this fit. No, I have no man. They ditch. They ditch you. Don't don't they took it.
4338920	4342520	They took an oath that says they can't ditch you. If you're, if you're, if you're, they don't give
4342520	4348520	a fuck unless you have insurance. No, you get your surgeries done in Orange County. Otherwise
4348520	4352040	don't go there. Cause I was in a hospital in Torrance and it just felt like it was going to
4352040	4359080	die. The hospital felt sick. That oath, that oath don't hold up to no earthquake, man.
4360120	4363720	Are you saying it would be better? I saw Walking Dead, you know how that hospital was filled with
4363720	4369000	people. Yeah. Did you see Walking Dead? Did you see the documentary Walking Dead? They bailed, bro.
4369000	4374840	They bailed. They all took, there were no doctor zombies in Walking Dead when he wakes up in a
4374840	4378440	hospital. There's no doctor with a stethoscope going around. I want to, I want to listen here.
4378440	4382760	Cause you know we treat zombies though. That's why. Did I, did I say on the show already about
4382760	4386200	Monhem? I like a year or two ago, I had all four of my wisdom teeth taken out that I already
4386200	4390520	talked about this and I woke up and I, and the doctor was gone and I was, I was, they said
4390520	4393560	beforehand, do you want to be under local anesthesia or general anesthesia? I said,
4393560	4397960	I don't want to be in the same country as I, I like that. Give me all you got. See that happened
4397960	4402840	to me last year too. Go ahead. So I, so I knew that one of them was really impacted and going
4402840	4407320	to be trouble, but this is really, so I woke up. I'm fine. They say like kind of dress loose,
4407400	4410280	like don't wear like certain kinds of clothes. Don't wear tight clothes. Don't wear this or that.
4411000	4413880	Because they might have to like actually, you know, physically like move you around a little
4413880	4417960	bit to get like, and you had some sort of hammer lock hole to get the shit out. And so I woke up,
4417960	4422920	the doctor's gone. The, the, his assistant, this woman was in there and I said, how did it go? And
4422920	4428520	she's like, was it okay? I'm like, was it, was it, was it hard? And she's like, yeah, it was a
4428520	4434280	struggle. And I'm like, how bad? And she was like, it was, it was like, it was hammer and tongs,
4434280	4438680	man. I was like, it was, she showed me my teeth. Yeah. Were they on her necklace?
4440520	4444840	There's just a Turkish world war two soldier comes out of the shadows. He's wearing your
4444840	4450040	teeth. They didn't look like teeth. I'll say that much. Those were in my head for how long?
4450040	4453800	That says more about you than them. I hadn't gotten a dentist a long time, but like,
4453800	4456840	three were fine. I thought one was laying sideways. So that one, they really had to
4456840	4461000	get in there with some fucking Byzantine shit and fucking really, do you remember when I had
4461720	4466600	no, I'm going to do this now. Okay. No, just real quick though. I, this is not a joke.
4466600	4475560	I had defense wounds on my wrists and my belt was off. Okay. One of those is weird. It was not a
4475560	4480360	Buckley belt. It was ones that kind of snap in, you know, like it wouldn't take a whole lot. I'm
4480360	4484760	like, what? Well, and I was like, like, she's like, he really had to, like, I think there was a point
4484760	4489560	that you had to really like, my shirt was all fucked up. There were, there were wrinkles,
4489640	4492520	like, like Colombo could tell if a bed has been slept in there could tell there had been a foot
4492520	4497720	on my chest. Like he was on me and like, we're bringing out the fucking heavy artillery. And,
4499640	4504920	the only way to make a tooth in that many pieces is to get in there was just absolutely like, oh,
4504920	4509240	man. And then he didn't tell me, he told me during the X-rays, he goes, one of your roots,
4509240	4512680	because you're so old now, you know, you should have had this done when you're 18. Now that you're
4512680	4518760	36 or seven or eight, whatever I was, you have to, the root grew up, your upper one,
4518760	4522840	it's right up to the edge of the sinus wall, which is a very thin, thin bone.
4522840	4523480	Oh, boy.
4525480	4529000	Though a lot of people have this dentist stuff, that's the thing.
4529000	4532760	So he said, he's like, and I'm not that squeamish about this. I didn't like the sound of this, but
4533320	4537320	he was like, it's possible that when I take it out, it might perforate the bone there. There might be
4537320	4541400	a little tiny hole in there. If it is, it'll heal up. It'll take longer to heal than the teeth.
4541960	4545160	And, but he goes, but this is a paperwork on if it happens, probably won't,
4545160	4549000	and you're healthy enough to the bone will regenerate and take a month if it does happen,
4549000	4552520	but don't worry about it too much. So I get home, I'm on every sort of medication,
4552520	4557560	and I was just absolutely shit canned on whatever they had given me. And my friend drove me home,
4557560	4564120	and I'm reading my paperwork and I'm changing the gauze, and I get some like some broth or whatever
4564120	4569320	I'm eating for my first meal. And you're not allowed to swish your mouth or anything. And so
4569320	4573080	I kind of leaned forward. And I was in the sink, I had a mouthful of soup, and I leaned forward,
4573080	4579960	and my soup came out of my nose. Because there was a little hole in the top of my mouth.
4581240	4584680	And I called him up in the middle, like, what the fuck is going on?
4585480	4589800	But you're the guy that can blow air out his eyeballs, too. I can't anymore. Why? Oh,
4589800	4594760	because the hole is gone. No, you know, I told him about that. I can I also you know what else
4594760	4598520	is gone. I took out my fucking wisdom teeth. I used to make a dolphin sound that would wipe you
4598520	4604760	out. I remember that. Can't do it now. Dolphin sound gone. I would have thought about that if I
4605560	4610200	had a chance. But also the thing did heal up for a couple days. He's like, Oh, so just here's the
4610200	4617800	thing. Don't blow your nose and do not sneeze for a month. Anymore involuntary shit that I should
4617800	4624120	know about. No breathing. If you have to sneeze, do it with your mouth as wide open as possible.
4624600	4636440	What does that look like? It's like the first act of speed. Somebody that's got a vendetta
4636440	4641880	against you has rigged your head. Look, I also want to talk about the fact that I have I have
4641880	4646840	what are consistent with defense wounds on my forearms from whatever fucking crisis went down
4646840	4650680	in your office. All right. Somebody's got to be the bad guy so that we can get some good good.
4650680	4654920	We can move on to the good stuff. I cut Matt off real quick. I cut. I think he was next,
4654920	4660440	but mine's not important. I see. Go ahead. Oh, wow. It's like a Mount Rushmore of deferral. Yeah.
4661160	4666200	No, no, no, no. Go ahead. We should bring that's what I'm saying. Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
4671320	4677480	Let's get this sausage party continued. I need, I need, I need to clear something up. When you
4677480	4685800	sneeze and turn it into a yell, it sounds like there's no chew. Yeah. It sounds really awesome.
4685800	4690760	Actually. Like you're like a super saying or something. Why do, why do you know that? Because
4690760	4695240	I've done it before. It's really funny. Why'd you have to do it? Because it's just, you know,
4695240	4699480	you didn't have to. It's so monotonous. If you're just doing it the same way. Oh yeah. I know.
4699480	4705720	I'm still over the way. I know. Right. He's a life hacker. Yeah. Because you, you, when you
4705720	4709640	sneeze, you're taught to condense it. But if you really just stand in a field and let it go,
4709640	4716520	it's something cathartic. You sound like a polar bear. I almost always stifle my sneezes
4716520	4721480	perfectly. I'll go like that. I feel like that must be bad for you. I've always, you know,
4721480	4728520	it goes into your brain. This snot goes into your brain. Don't look it up. I mean,
4728520	4733080	I don't think that, but I just feel like that's what I was told as a kid. That's definitely not
4733080	4738360	true. Well, they say like, you know, antiperspirant, it's bad for you. It's blocking your, your sweat
4738360	4743080	glands with, you know, what's the difference between that and a stifling a sneeze. I ask you
4743080	4750760	don't answer move on. Spencer, how's, how's, how's, how's, how's life at home?
4751960	4757800	I just got back. I saw my cat again. It was nice. We were at sketch fest not too long ago.
4757800	4761480	Who takes care of your cat while you're out of town? I got Jackson. It was my roommate to,
4761480	4766040	to feed him. I don't see him around here. He needs to come to the shows a lot.
4766040	4771880	Like, how do you, how do you know he's a good cat sitter? I don't know. I just, well, I mean,
4771880	4775720	I took all the guesswork out of it. I measured out the food and put them in bags and taped them
4775720	4781960	above the cap bowl. And then I labeled them with times and dates because I bet you 10 bucks the
4781960	4787000	hour before your flight came back. They were all going in the toilet. Yeah. Empty bag time.
4787720	4792520	Yeah. It's like a cop breaking down the door of a drug dealer. He's pouring it down all down
4792520	4799240	the toilet. I mean, she was still alive. So I'm good. Do you fly a lot, Spencer? I mean,
4799240	4806600	I don't fly none. I, before I worked at Apple, I worked at a small bookstore and occasionally
4806600	4811960	like two or three times a year, I'd go and fly out to book conferences, which are kind of like
4811960	4818760	comic cons just for random books. It was a chance to see a big bookstore. Yeah. Would people dress
4818760	4826200	up as their favorite books? The actual book. Yeah. I don't want a dog pile and everything you say,
4826200	4834760	but was it a, do they sell small books or is the store small? Is it like pamphlets and booklets or?
4835000	4842040	Yeah. And short stories. All right. Continue until you say another combination of words that
4842040	4846440	my Asperger's can jump on. But I would just go and they'd sell books for cheap because it'd be like
4846440	4851800	publishers trying to get down their stocks. And I'd just go and buy like several booths and I'd,
4851800	4857400	you know, get them all packed up and ship back to the main office. Oh, so you would go buy them at
4857400	4861800	fairs and then sell them for a profit at your small bookstore. Yeah. Was there like a community of
4861800	4866920	people that did this with like, did you all end up at the same TGA Fridays? Not that I knew,
4866920	4871720	I'm sure if I did it for long enough, there would be. And then, but I think they're all enemies.
4871720	4875320	It's like, you know, Pawn Stars, where it's just a bunch of trashy people selling garbage.
4876120	4881640	Like, and they're just elbowing each other for like a porcelain duck. But I mean,
4881640	4886520	it's, if you're, if you're making a living off of selling like reclaimed stuff, I don't know.
4886520	4891240	I don't know you guys. I don't love Pawn Stars because I always feel like the people who are
4891240	4895560	selling this stuff are clearly in need, like they're in a bad place. They're selling shit.
4895560	4899080	And then these guys are like talking to the camera like I've got it for 300 bucks. I can
4899080	4903800	sell it for $4,000. Like, and these are clearly rich people. It always bugs me that it takes the
4903800	4908520	side of the people who are clearly the big bad guy. And it's really not adding value to anything.
4908520	4913880	I don't think I'm sure I'm wrong, but I mean, you could be like a building a bridge. Is it supposed
4913880	4919400	to be, I've seen it like flipping through the, yeah, you know, your TV channel guide thing.
4919400	4922360	I've never watched it. Is it supposed to be, I'm just realizing now, is it supposed to be a
4922360	4928120	play on Pawn Stars? Yup. Yeah. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Dumb that I didn't get that, but still dumb.
4928120	4933400	Yeah. That's a bold stance. Yeah. Pawn Stars. Pawn is the only on industry,
4933400	4936760	I think, where every single performer is a star right when you start.
4939160	4942520	Right? That's nice. That's nice. Check off stars.
4943240	4946600	It doesn't have the same ring. Well, I mean, what about amateurs, right?
4948920	4952440	Aren't they still just amateur porn stars? Yeah. They're amateur porn stars.
4953240	4958920	They're on the pro-am, sure. Yeah. You're either not a nothing or you do one porn and then you're
4958920	4963160	a porn star. I think there's some famous old actor like Clint Eastwood or someone like that.
4963160	4969320	It's like, why come porn stars? There's no porn, like walk-ons or porn extras.
4970200	4972840	Some actor was actually saying it. Oh, really? That's stupid.
4972840	4976440	There are porn extras. There's porn extras.
4980120	4984520	I knew the producer. Oh, sorry. That's just not a joke, not being funny.
4984520	4988840	Yeah, but you said it with an ominousness that freaked me out.
4988840	4990040	The truth can be ominous.
4993080	4996520	There are no small parts in porn, only small people.
4997160	5000600	Definitely no small parts.
5004200	5011400	There was a producer I talked to who got really mad at one point when I was on this rant about how
5011400	5017400	do you ever notice that it's always the best boy or the key grip that has the funny nickname
5017400	5023240	and the credits? It's like, fuck you. Kurt Russell's in this movie. Why is the guy pointing
5023240	5031160	the light at him? Oh, he's the Terminator. Fuck you. That's kind of funny. It's funny how
5031160	5037160	mad he was. It was funny. I'm obviously pro-labor if you rewind this podcast and listen to it
5037160	5041640	clearly. Yeah, I think it's great that the best boy should have a funny nickname.
5042360	5049560	Like Stub-Norts. And also Kurt Russell. Make yourself known to us, Stub-Norts. Listen to
5049560	5057080	hear me, Stub-Norts. Hear me. Stub-Norts, can you hear me? Find me. That's his first name.
5058600	5061960	Yeah, it is because they all go by their first names. His last name is Dan.
5063080	5067240	Stub-Norts, Dan. Get in your Chrysler LeBaron and drive to me.
5068040	5073720	Oh God, he's like the fucking golden ticket of Uber drivers now. Somebody gets them.
5073720	5079560	No, I got Stub-Norts. Yeah, that's amazing. If he gets Stub-Norts. If anybody gets Stub-Norts,
5079560	5084040	tweet that shit. Take a screen grab. Take a picture. Oh, I wish I had. I'm gonna screen
5084040	5089800	grab all the Uber drivers now and I'm gonna get on this. Is that not a Tumblr? It's gotta be.
5090760	5094920	I think we're the guys to start it. We're the playboys that are jetting around in Ubers.
5094920	5101000	I followed this weird Tumblr the other day called And Englishmen. Has anybody heard of this?
5101000	5106280	Okay, so it's just a bunch of tweety like Roger Moore Englishmen and then I think it's called
5106280	5111400	And Englishmen because at one point every three days they'll just be a naked black lady and I
5111400	5119400	think what they mean is like naked black lady oh and Englishmen but consistently every couple of
5119400	5126600	days. Who's it for most of all? I don't know. Apparently me and then me again when you really
5126600	5131560	find out. Yeah, you learn some. Is that a cleaning service? What are you talking about? No, it's a
5131560	5138600	Tumblr. It's called And Englishmen and you think you're getting just tweets and equestrian people.
5138600	5145720	Don't ask me why. Because that's your afternoon. So you started by calling an Englishman and then
5145720	5151800	he was like yeah but I really like this naked black lady and then someone wrote in and stuff.
5151800	5159800	Actually, that's not an Englishman. There's a Twitter account called Coffee Dad. Do you guys
5159800	5165640	follow it? It's a coffee dad. It was just a guy holding a coffee, older man, and for three months
5165640	5169640	it's just him getting another cup of coffee, hot cup of coffee, cup of gel. It's that time of the
5169640	5175000	day. He can't use hashtags, right? Yeah, for three months and then one tweet was every time I closed
5175000	5181400	my eyes I smelled your hair. I miss you my son. And then three more months of going to get coffee,
5181400	5187240	time to get coffee, and then like I'll never forgive myself. Is that just Dana Gould being
5187240	5192840	funny on Twitter? It's somebody being funny but it's amazing. It's three months of groundwork
5192840	5201160	every day for like pay off for so few people. How is that discovered? I don't know. You gotta stick
5201240	5205800	with that for three months? Three months? What's for sale for you for that first three months?
5206760	5213880	They're short. It's just like hashtag having space coffee. He's like a middle-aged guy who
5213880	5217720	doesn't know what Twitter is and just likes coffee a whole bunch. It's kind of amusing.
5217720	5221800	Yeah, until he talks about his credit. I'm saying, were you following them?
5221800	5227960	Before that became a funny thing to go against? No, I followed it when? After the denouement.
5227960	5235320	All right. Let's do some Dungeons and Dragons. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know. That's
5235320	5241720	French. I do like that a guy named Comel Nanjiani is making fun of people for having weird names
5241720	5246840	for an hour. Yeah, the hunters become the hunted or vice versa. The tables have turned,
5246840	5252360	stuff norts. There's a new share of it down and his name is slightly less weird than yours.
5252520	5260440	You have a weird name, but it's like a beautiful starburst roller coaster. There's no speed bumps
5260440	5269000	on it. Comel Nanjiani. It's like water trickling over polished stone. What does it mean? Does that
5269000	5274280	mean that? Yeah, it really actually does mean water over polished stone. It loosely translates
5274280	5281080	to stuff norts. There is no translation for stuff norts. It's like shopping for it. This character
5281080	5285960	sheets for Matt and then to him. Comel, one of my deeper grits in life is that I've tried,
5285960	5290440	because once in a while, if I'm telling a story that involves somebody, I'll try to do a mild
5290440	5294840	impression of them. Not to mock them because I'm so good at impressions, but you just try to do the
5294840	5299000	voice. I wish I could do your voice because your voice is delightful and I can't get anywhere close.
5299000	5303640	When I kind of come close, I'm doing it way wrong and it's offensive. It's not offensive.
5303640	5307960	No, I just can't get the... There's the lilts of the voice that I can't quite do. Give me something
5307960	5313560	to say to practice. Give me a word to practice on so I can start honing my kumail on practice.
5313560	5316200	What's a good word that would be? Anything.
5316200	5318280	That I can't. Can't.
5318920	5320920	Say, I can't do something. Yeah, I can't do something.
5320920	5322840	I can't do something. I can't dance.
5322840	5328040	I can't dance. No, I go a little bit like poon jab.
5328040	5331000	Yeah, little little poo buddy. You had no little...
5332840	5337000	Go for it. It's not willful. If I could talk like that, I'd never stop.
5337000	5338840	All right, Spencer. Yeah.
5338840	5339800	Start talking. Oh.
5342200	5346520	Last time on Harmon Town. The party was in dire straits,
5346520	5351160	chained by their very souls and in the clutches of undead bureaucrats.
5351160	5356680	After the bone sages of Tormad Tor enacted the mysterious rites of Telimvarna,
5356680	5361880	they began the proceedings by shouting and asking for the guilty party to reveal themselves.
5361960	5366200	Immediately, Moraine Sedana, suffering from a rash of poor life decisions,
5366200	5369640	came forward, confusing and bewildering all.
5369640	5373880	Quark struggled against his chains and managed to sever his ties.
5373880	5378600	But that only began a countdown to the total eradication of his very soul.
5378600	5381160	That's a bad idea. I keep saying very souls in this thing.
5382600	5385000	With their very souls captive in their muscle.
5385800	5390840	On a death timer, how would they escape the rights of Telimvarna and their own
5390840	5396040	collective death witch? Witch, death, collective death wish.
5397240	5399880	Find out, blah, blah, on the next, blah, blah, yeah.
5406280	5409640	So you guys hungry? I could really go for a nice collective death witch, really.
5411640	5415240	Top of the show, bottom of the D&D, top of the D&D show notes.
5415240	5418440	Quark, you're still about 10 minutes from dying.
5418440	5421640	Sharpie, you're a chained cloud of gas.
5421640	5424200	Oh, right, thank you. He is a cloud of gas?
5424200	5426520	Yeah, he turned into one.
5426520	5427320	On purpose?
5427320	5427800	Yeah, yeah.
5428520	5431080	You don't turn into a cloud of gas on accident.
5432760	5434760	No, but was it somebody else? Hex Tim?
5434760	5437880	No, he was trying to get out of his soul chain.
5437880	5440600	And I had these soul chains that go into our bodies.
5440600	5443000	I ripped it out and I felt like my soul was leaving.
5443000	5445560	So I put them back in and then I tried to just sever the thing.
5445560	5448040	And then they're kind of just retreating into my body like a fuse.
5448040	5452360	And I've got about 10 minutes or so before something, probably, life ending happens.
5452360	5454040	What's Chris de Bourgh doing?
5454040	5455800	You're also chained by the soul.
5457560	5461880	So yeah, you guys are all in this, all up in this, you know,
5461880	5465960	broken dead shirt surrounded by all these hooded, undead dudes.
5465960	5469480	There's the Bone Sages, you know, Tor, Mod, and Second Tor.
5470440	5475880	Second Tor speaks, since the accused has already made a mockery of our law.
5475960	5479080	We will appoint a special defendant for your shackling.
5479080	5483880	Of course, this means that Leneve will be granted power of special persecutor in return.
5484440	5486200	Bring out the special defendant.
5487320	5488520	Special defendant.
5488520	5491240	Hi, I'm Skeleton Gary and I will fight for you.
5493960	5497080	I'm from the law firm of Femur, Phalangian, Shapiro.
5500200	5502040	Femur, Phalangian, Shapiro.
5502920	5506040	The only cage you're going to see is my rib cage.
5506840	5511640	When you're buying me drinks and the beer is flowing through it because we've won our case,
5511640	5513080	let's fight for you.
5514840	5516040	Oh, this is great.
5517240	5518280	So he's our lawyer?
5519080	5520520	Yes, yes he is.
5521240	5525800	I will convene a brief recess if you want to catch him up on any trial notes or
5525800	5527560	anything that you might want him to know.
5527560	5531560	Yeah, anything you want to disclose to me would be of service.
5531560	5535160	Okay, I have an evil demon inside of me.
5535160	5535880	Check.
5535880	5543240	I am a short barbarian gnome who has 10 minutes to live.
5543240	5543960	Yeah, all right.
5544840	5550360	This whole thing got started because I'm an alcoholic who's given to rageaholism
5550360	5555000	and I perceived a threat with...
5556440	5558040	Okay, now talk about your character.
5558040	5559160	Oh, no.
5561160	5562840	That's not really, I mean...
5562840	5563560	Come on.
5563560	5565320	Good, this rapport, we can use this.
5565320	5566440	People are going to like this.
5567320	5567560	Good.
5568760	5574200	I perceived a threat when this Linnev guy, he said, are you cool?
5574200	5574920	Are you a friend?
5574920	5575960	And he said, yeah, I am.
5575960	5577560	And he said, how do we know?
5577560	5579640	And he said, well, I'm not eating your face.
5580440	5582760	I thought that was a threat.
5583800	5584360	I see.
5585240	5587640	I thought that meant that if we stepped over the line,
5587720	5592120	I thought that was him saying, I'll eat your face if I stop like you.
5592120	5595640	Yeah, we got off on the wrong foot with Linnev and now things are bad.
5595640	5600360	So wait, he said, you thought he said if you cross a line, he's going to end you.
5600360	5602360	And so you decided to cross the line?
5603560	5605480	Preemptively in self-defense.
5605480	5606200	We'll handle this.
5607560	5610120	What right does any being have to draw those kinds of lines?
5610120	5611720	Can we leave that fucking discussion?
5611720	5612840	I've got 10 minutes to live.
5612840	5614040	We've been through that.
5614040	5615560	Well, this could be the crux of his case.
5615560	5616360	That's why we're here.
5616680	5618520	What do you think Linnev's going to be talking about out there?
5618520	5620040	It's not a big misunderstanding.
5620040	5621720	We didn't mean to kill the whole village.
5621720	5622760	Come again?
5622760	5628040	Also, we made several friendly overtures as he got mad time and time again.
5628040	5630360	We extended friendliness to him.
5630360	5632120	He took us back to this place.
5632120	5635400	And after it was clearly established that we were friendly,
5636600	5639400	he then announced that we were bad people.
5639400	5641240	And that's why we're soul shackled.
5641240	5642360	Because believe me, I wouldn't be here.
5642360	5643480	Do you know anything about...
5643480	5645960	Larry, do you know anything about the rights of Telumvarna?
5645960	5648200	That's what I did my thesis on.
5650280	5651400	Now, I don't want to worry you.
5651400	5652520	This is my first case.
5654200	5657880	I was a boat repairman for, I don't know, 20 years.
5657880	5660360	And I did law as a hobby.
5660360	5661960	I'm a hobbyist lawyer.
5661960	5663880	But go team.
5663880	5664520	We're going to do this.
5664520	5669080	So your day job is still repairing boats?
5669080	5670760	Well, I don't get paid for it anymore.
5670760	5671640	I was fired.
5672520	5673080	Why?
5673080	5674280	My boats would sink.
5675240	5677000	Well, don't sink this boat.
5678120	5678920	Wouldn't happen.
5678920	5680280	Recess is over.
5680280	5681560	Recess is over.
5681560	5681880	Oh.
5681880	5682840	Recess is over.
5682840	5684280	Say the three bone sages.
5685240	5686040	One at a time.
5687320	5688760	We shall proceed now.
5689400	5690840	Special persecutor.
5690840	5691320	Speak.
5692200	5692760	Lenev...
5692760	5693160	Lenev...
5693160	5694600	I don't know if you can hear, but every time you say
5694600	5696520	persecutor instead of persecutor, Adam Goldberg
5696520	5697960	corrects you from the audience.
5697960	5698840	Yeah, I like you.
5698840	5702520	Yeah, it's like an old cartoon when I was a kid gag.
5702520	5704200	I'd give credit if I knew what it was.
5704920	5705400	Anyway.
5705400	5707640	I just wanted to point it out so it doesn't happen all night.
5709800	5714120	Lenev, he addresses this circle of hooded figures
5714120	5716200	kind of standing around you guys.
5716200	5718680	He says, gentlemen, you no doubt remember
5718680	5721000	how we all came together to stave off
5721000	5723480	the Dark Admiral's demonic sorcerers
5723480	5725560	as well as how you rallied with me
5725560	5727800	to break the siege of the Frost Giants
5727800	5729720	and their necromantic king.
5729720	5731800	Today we face a similar challenge
5731880	5734440	in recovering from the artisan disaster.
5734440	5737480	I scarcely need to mention the hundred of lost lives
5737480	5739960	but despite those most giving of rib
5739960	5743720	who devoted eternity to staving off the inevitable decay
5743720	5746920	I tell you we will rally again and we will carry on
5746920	5751320	but not if we allow these maniacs to continue their rampage.
5751320	5753560	You stand before the four culprits
5753560	5755960	of the destruction of the artisan Xanax
5755960	5758760	and the murder of our most valued craftsmen
5758760	5760200	and we will have vengeance.
5761000	5762600	The ring of hooded bodies hisses
5762600	5765400	and stamps their feet bones rattling in rage.
5765400	5766680	Okay, I huddle with the guys.
5766680	5768200	Who are the artisans that we killed?
5768200	5769960	Yeah, this is your first case?
5771160	5774440	Yeah, I mean, I've done some model United Nations before but
5775720	5776360	it's all right.
5777400	5779720	Can we remind these people that we did everything we
5779720	5781000	killed Admiral Darkstar.
5781000	5783160	We were responsible for everything good
5783160	5784280	that's happened in this region.
5784280	5785880	And it was his palace that fell down
5785880	5787320	on all the artisans or whatever.
5787320	5788920	Hold it for the cross-examination.
5788920	5789720	We've got this.
5790440	5791800	No, that's not how this works.
5791800	5792200	What?
5793080	5793400	Okay.
5795000	5797320	The cross-examination shall begin shortly.
5797960	5798680	I mean now.
5799240	5799720	All right.
5800520	5802840	The defense would like to call to the stand.
5802840	5804120	Quark, please.
5804120	5805480	Yes. Hello.
5806200	5806440	Now.
5806440	5807080	My name is Quark.
5808760	5810440	How are you feeling today?
5810440	5811080	Not so good.
5811880	5812920	Why am I doing your accent?
5812920	5813400	I don't know.
5815400	5816120	I feel like shit.
5816200	5820040	I got a soul chain fuse taken down to my chest.
5820040	5820760	There you have it.
5820760	5822840	First of all, we have a medical expediency
5822840	5826040	that we need to make sure is in.
5826040	5826920	Is there a jury?
5828120	5829080	Uh, no.
5830360	5831560	Just a judge?
5831560	5833640	There's the council.
5833640	5835240	Yeah, the three bones sages.
5835240	5835880	Oh, okay.
5835880	5836360	All right.
5836360	5836760	Yes.
5836760	5839480	Like the Superman guys, the guilty, guilty.
5839480	5840280	Exactly.
5840280	5841080	All right.
5841080	5841400	We have a-
5841400	5843000	Don't use that word so much.
5844200	5845480	We have a medical expediency.
5845480	5848120	So I will ask you to take some sort of leniency
5848120	5849640	and consider that.
5849640	5850680	Now, thank you very much.
5850680	5851160	You've been great.
5851160	5852200	Lie down.
5852200	5852920	I'll say thank you.
5852920	5853640	You're welcome.
5853640	5855320	I'd like to call to the stand Sharpie.
5856120	5856760	Yes.
5856760	5861160	Sharpie, are you in fact a corporeal body right now?
5861160	5863240	No, I'm made of gas at the present time.
5863240	5866360	Would you say you're a big ball of gas?
5867000	5867480	I mean, I-
5867480	5869960	A lot of hot air?
5869960	5870760	Well, I-
5870760	5874280	Blustery wind that wouldn't mean anything sincerely.
5874280	5875000	You're joking.
5875000	5876120	You're chesting a lot.
5877000	5878840	Yeah, but I'm not always this way.
5879880	5881080	But you are now.
5881080	5881560	Right.
5881560	5883640	And you have been in the recent past.
5884360	5884600	Yes.
5885240	5887720	So it would be difficult for someone to take, say,
5887720	5889640	a comment or a threat seriously.
5889640	5891240	And if they did, that might be on them.
5891880	5892120	Yeah.
5892120	5892600	Well, if you're-
5892600	5894840	I mean, I just turned to gas like five minutes ago.
5894840	5895080	Okay.
5897560	5898280	Sidebar.
5898280	5898760	Sidebar.
5898760	5899240	Sidebar.
5901880	5903240	He's trying to help you.
5903320	5904280	Yeah, but I mean, I can't-
5904280	5905080	I mean-
5905080	5906120	They weren't going to buy that.
5906120	5906760	Yeah.
5906760	5908200	Nobody was taking the physical-
5908200	5909240	I like where he was going with that.
5909240	5910440	Yeah, he was taking the physical form,
5910440	5912760	and he was making a bigger metaphorical point.
5912760	5913560	I will continue.
5914760	5917480	Though you are now physically a ball of gas,
5917480	5918840	and you weren't at the time,
5918840	5920840	is it not true that when you go through
5920840	5922600	some sort of transformation,
5922600	5924520	like when you're drunk, you become your true self?
5925240	5928040	You have now turned into what essentially your essence is,
5928040	5932440	and that's a wag, a jester, just someone who has a good laugh.
5932760	5935160	I am an alcoholic, and I have a problem with authority.
5939640	5940600	If that's what you're asking.
5942200	5947160	Do they all have to be sentenced individually,
5947160	5949480	or as a whole, can we cast one aside?
5951720	5952680	Throw one to the dogs.
5952680	5953880	I was asking the judge.
5954440	5955000	Yes.
5955000	5955880	Okay, good.
5955880	5956200	All right.
5957400	5958760	Chris, I call to the stand.
5958760	5959960	Chris de Burke.
5959960	5960600	Hey.
5960600	5963320	Chris, what the fuck is going on here, Chris?
5963880	5965400	Okay, here's what happened.
5965400	5966120	Yeah.
5966120	5967960	I don't know these guys that well.
5967960	5968760	Fair enough.
5968760	5969400	I like this.
5969400	5970360	I like this.
5970360	5972760	And I have literally been fighting them
5972760	5974920	for the last few hours.
5974920	5975400	I asked them.
5975400	5978520	I've been vomiting on their faces.
5978520	5981400	Because you're possessed by shooting laser eyes at them
5981400	5985160	in an effort to get them to stop killing all the artisans
5985160	5986360	that they'd been talking.
5986360	5986840	It's not true.
5986840	5987560	Hoorump!
5987560	5988200	Hoorump!
5988200	5988680	Hoorump!
5988680	5989160	Hoorump!
5989160	5989880	Hoorump!
5989880	5990360	Hoorump!
5990360	5990840	Hoorump!
5990840	5991320	Hoorump!
5991320	5991880	Hoorump!
5991880	5992360	Jesus.
5993080	5993800	All right.
5993800	5994760	Okay, yeah.
5994760	5996520	How did the castle fall down?
5997400	5998200	Isn't there a castle?
5998200	6001240	Yeah, we killed Admiral Darkstar.
6001240	6004120	But because he had it coming.
6004120	6004440	Yes.
6004440	6004840	Oh, yeah.
6004840	6006120	Everybody agrees.
6006120	6007560	Everybody here agrees with that, yeah.
6007560	6009720	Your honor, you did great service, Phil and Anne.
6009720	6009720	
6009720	6012760	Without the history, we wouldn't even be having this conversation
6012760	6013640	because we won't be dead.
6013640	6015480	He'd still be alive if we don't be on the run
6015480	6016520	from Admiral Darkstar.
6016520	6017320	Instead, we destroy-
6017320	6017800	If you're dead.
6017800	6018840	If not dead already!
6018840	6019080	Yeah.
6019160	6022360	Instead of everybody being dead, we just killed all the artisans.
6022360	6023720	Let me rephrase that.
6023720	6028520	Instead of everyone being dead because of the good we did,
6029480	6031000	all the artisans are dead.
6034200	6039160	Your honor, there's a term in warfare and governments
6039160	6040440	called collateral damage.
6041080	6043800	That the needs of the many are greater than the needs of the few.
6043800	6045160	And I think that's what we have here.
6045160	6047240	And if you fail to appreciate that, you might as well-
6047880	6050680	Your justice and your morals might be as dead
6050680	6053000	as you would be if Darkstar was alive.
6053000	6053960	I think he is alive.
6053960	6055560	I think he's possessed Christopher.
6055560	6057000	I think that's why he's being an asshole.
6057000	6057560	Hooropf!
6057560	6057880	Hooropf!
6057880	6059000	We never saw him die.
6059000	6059480	Hooropf!
6059480	6060920	We killed him and then a giant robot
6060920	6061880	and then we ripped his head off.
6061880	6062840	There was gas everywhere.
6062840	6063880	I don't know what the fuck.
6063880	6067720	And then I think Admiral Darkstar is still alive.
6067720	6070680	And I certainly know he's alive in the hearts of all you assholes
6070680	6072200	if you continue to be dicks to us.
6073240	6075080	Because that's what Admiral Darkstar wants.
6075080	6076440	He wants us fighting each other.
6076920	6077960	I hate everyone!
6079160	6080280	I'm still on the stand.
6080280	6083320	Can I say I am not possessed by Admiral Darkstar.
6083960	6086760	But maybe he wasn't such a bad guy, right?
6088760	6089320	All right.
6089320	6089880	All right.
6089880	6090600	All right.
6090600	6091320	Hooropf!
6091320	6092120	All right.
6092120	6093560	Maybe he has some good points.
6094600	6096120	Now, your honor?
6098040	6098600	Your honor?
6099800	6100280	Yes.
6100280	6100920	What, huh?
6101640	6102360	There's three of them.
6103160	6103720	Your honors.
6104600	6105800	It's yours honor.
6105800	6106680	Yours honor.
6106680	6107960	I was just thinking it.
6109080	6109560	All right.
6111800	6115000	I'm going to invoke a little-known
6116440	6119800	carousel of the legal book called the Kansas Clause.
6119800	6120360	All right.
6120360	6120680	Oh, shit.
6120680	6126280	Where if a house falls on a witch, it's not the house owner,
6126280	6128680	or occupant, or visitor's fault.
6128680	6131640	They were merely going about that day.
6131640	6132040	They did.
6132920	6134680	Can you prove any intent to kill?
6135320	6138840	At worst, this is involuntary manslaughter and not artisan murder.
6139880	6143080	But put that out of your triad of brains.
6144920	6146360	And look at these faces.
6146360	6147640	First, let's start over there.
6147640	6148920	Look at that face.
6148920	6149420	Yeah.
6150680	6151400	Look at that.
6151400	6153640	Look at that salt and pepper beard.
6154280	6155880	The sweet disposition.
6155880	6158840	The very fear of having blood drawn.
6158840	6163000	Same face, by the way, that spit in your beloved frost giant's eyes.
6163560	6164200	All right.
6164200	6165560	They love them so much.
6165560	6166680	Shut your prison hole.
6173480	6175000	Let's take a look at Christopher.
6175960	6177080	Look at that face.
6179800	6181240	This is an artisan killer?
6183320	6184040	Let me tell you something.
6184040	6187160	I went to a college with a man who had killed artisans.
6187160	6189400	He was a big, brawling man.
6189400	6190440	He had studs.
6190440	6191560	He had pink in his hair.
6191560	6192680	He was a punk rocker.
6192680	6194600	That was an artisan killer.
6194600	6195080	Look at this.
6195080	6196040	Listen to him speak.
6196040	6196760	Say the word.
6196760	6198680	I can't even do it.
6199240	6200040	I can't even do it.
6200040	6201000	Listen to that.
6201960	6202920	I can't dance.
6203640	6204840	It's so sweet.
6204840	6207640	Now, we have a limited time over here.
6209080	6210600	Am I stoned a barbarian rage or no?
6211160	6211720	No, please.
6211720	6212120	No.
6212120	6212360	Okay.
6213320	6214040	He's weak.
6214040	6214840	He's fragile.
6215560	6216280	He's sickly.
6216280	6216760	He's brutal.
6216760	6217560	I don't want to die.
6219080	6221000	I don't want to die, Larry.
6221000	6222520	Do you want to do this, Tim?
6223480	6224120	Oh, my.
6224120	6225320	Look at this face.
6225320	6227880	Now, there are three of you, and there are three of them.
6228520	6233240	And what I ask you is that if all of you are going to find them guilty,
6233240	6235160	you have to find all three of them guilty,
6235160	6239640	but all three of you must find one innocent little lamb among these three.
6239640	6241960	And if there's one, certainly there could be three.
6245640	6246680	Don't kill them.
6247800	6248520	Let them live.
6248520	6249560	And I will tell you this.
6249560	6257000	If you let them go, they will bring you back the head of the marsh minotaur.
6258920	6259320	Shut up.
6259320	6260040	Go with me.
6260040	6260760	Hurrow.
6260760	6261320	Go with me.
6261320	6261800	Hurrow.
6261800	6262360	Go with me.
6262360	6266040	Who I know is the scourge of the...
6266040	6266920	Jesus Christ.
6268760	6270280	There's our next Monday.
6270280	6270600	Yes.
6272040	6276520	He's the scourge of the flea market hills.
6276760	6282600	He's been going in there every Sunday when they have their little farmer's market,
6282600	6285640	and he's taking the goat cheeses and the artisan breads,
6285640	6288520	and he's taking them for themselves, the poor peasants.
6288520	6290920	They need to be rid of him.
6290920	6293400	If you see in your heart to let these three go,
6294040	6296200	they will bring you the head of the marsh minotaur.
6296200	6298840	That is absolutely my guarantee.
6298840	6301880	And then, if they don't, lock them up and throw away the key.
6301880	6303960	Send them into the pits of Scaldor.
6304440	6307640	Send them into the sex caverns of Jambi-dive.
6307640	6312840	Send them to the dungeons of Stub-Norts for all I care.
6314840	6317240	But these people are not guilty.
6317240	6318280	I rest my case.
6318280	6319080	No further questions.
6319080	6320120	Attica, Attica.
6322120	6323640	You are out of order.
6323640	6324120	Whoa.
6326120	6329560	So, the bone sages, they deliberate.
6329560	6330360	They deliberate.
6330360	6331160	They grumble.
6331160	6334440	They grumble and groan and talk to each other for a while,
6334440	6337880	and they're like, that guy and his fucking goat cheeses,
6337880	6340760	he has been a thorn in our side.
6340760	6344040	Well, you guys have made really good points.
6344040	6346280	I'm actually quite astonished.
6346280	6351080	You came up with possessions and all sorts of reasons
6351080	6354520	why they might not totally have been in their right minds.
6354520	6358040	And it seems like, did you mention that they killed Admiral Darkstar?
6358040	6359640	Are you serious about that?
6359640	6361640	Yeah, as a great service to the land.
6361640	6364440	Even Lenev couldn't do that.
6364440	6366120	Lenev is a pussy willow.
6366120	6370040	He's been titty-bitched, and he can go screw.
6370040	6372920	I got to admit, when he came in here hissing and yelling,
6372920	6376040	I was pretty perturbed by that whole thing.
6376040	6377640	Yeah, he's a little bit of a fuckface.
6377640	6380040	I was surprised when he brought us in.
6380040	6384760	I was actually impressed that he belonged to you as a people.
6384760	6387320	And it didn't mesh.
6387320	6389800	I mean, he's still a great warrior and a hero to our people.
6389800	6392440	How do we know that it wasn't Lenev that killed the artisans
6392440	6394200	and is trying to pin it on us?
6394200	6394920	We don't?
6398920	6401400	Well, then that settles it.
6401400	6405000	Bring out the beast of burden and tell him Varna shell.
6405000	6405880	Finish.
6405880	6406360	What?
6406360	6408200	Tell him Varna!
6408200	6409960	Tell him Varna!
6409960	6411400	Tell him Varna!
6411400	6412760	Tell him Varna!
6412760	6414360	Tell him Varna!
6415320	6416760	Tell him Varna!
6416760	6422600	Something resembling a large, maybe like a cow-sized, fleshy,
6422600	6425720	six-legged pill bug, like a pill bug.
6425720	6430520	But fleshy, fleshy, trundles into the church.
6430520	6432040	Like a skin tag?
6432040	6437080	Yeah, but like a roly-poly that's a skin tag.
6437080	6438200	That's what's happening.
6438200	6442040	Trundles into the church and kind of stands in front of you guys
6442040	6444520	before you see his head flesh.
6444520	6447800	It peels back and reveals a strange skull.
6447800	6455000	And the skull gives a screech and then shatters and it falls dead.
6456200	6457400	Tell him Varna is over.
6458440	6459880	The shackles vanish.
6459880	6460360	Jesus.
6462760	6464520	I thought that was going to go a different direction.
6465560	6467480	I think in the skeleton justice system,
6467560	6472840	it's better to let one man go free than to not have 10 potato bugs.
6472840	6473560	Skulls shatter.
6474920	6475480	Something like that.
6477240	6479240	You shall take care of the marshmilla tar.
6479880	6480760	Okay.
6480760	6482520	Is that negotiable or?
6482520	6483640	Hey, are we locked into that?
6483640	6485960	Did you not see the beast of burden just now?
6486600	6487160	We saw him.
6487160	6488120	We did make a promise.
6488120	6489480	It's not negotiable.
6489480	6490440	Oh, okay.
6490440	6497000	I gather our little group together and I shake Larry's hand and say,
6497000	6499480	I got to be honest, Larry, I didn't think when you started that you,
6499480	6503560	you had what it took, but you really, uh, you can't be able to speak out there.
6504440	6509080	Larry, did you, were you making up the marshmilla tar?
6509080	6509240	Yeah.
6509240	6510360	I mean, that was just bullshit, right?
6511800	6512040	No.
6513800	6514760	That's a real thing.
6514760	6516280	That is fearsome.
6516840	6518040	Wait till you get my bill.
6523880	6524760	That's a closer.
6524760	6526040	Oh yeah.
6526040	6526920	Lawyer Joe.
6526920	6528440	Skeleton Lawyer Closer.

6532760	6533720	I'll fight for you.
6534280	6535160	I did it for them.
6535160	6536120	I can do it for you.
6537080	6538120	Skeleton Gary.
6538120	6539240	Matt Goley, everyone.

6551400	6553880	One more time for your mayor of Harmon Town, Mr. Dan Harmon.
