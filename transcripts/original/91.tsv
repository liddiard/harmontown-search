0	22080	Oh, yeah. Hello. Welcome to Meltdown Comics. The Nerd Mel Theater in the epicenter of Hollywood,
22080	36480	California. Harbin Town is now in session. Buckle up motherfuckers. Welcome to the stage.
36480	49160	The mayor of Harbin Town, Dan Harmon. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Fuck your mama,
49160	53600	fuck your daddy in the mouth. I fucked your daddy from the north to the south. Predictable
53600	57840	rhymes, I don't care, I'm still rapping. Rapping like I was a butt, that's crappin'.
57840	63280	Crappin' in the toilet, that is your ears. Dominatin' your desires and fears. Freestyle
63280	66800	rapping like I've never done before. Fuck your mama on the ceiling, fuck your mama on
66800	71760	the floor. I'm rapping, freestyle rapping. Sounds like it's written, but I'm freestyle
71760	75920	rapping. Didn't think about it in the green room at all. Now I'm gonna fuck your mama
75920	80000	in the summer and fall. Fuck your mama, fuck your daddy on the street. Fuck your mama in
80000	85200	her mouth, fuck your daddy on his feet. Come on his toes, put on his shoes, take him downtown
85200	90760	and show him the blues. Teach him how to roll with the blacks. Teach him how to feel his
90760	101480	slacks. Take him shopping, take him shopping. Lumberjacks. Yo, yo, yo, what, yo, yo, rapping.
109080	114680	Fuckin' intense. I don't know if you've ever spit fire before, but it comes through you.
114680	121720	Like, the term spit implies that it starts inside you. It's not true. It comes through
121720	128600	the back of your head. It goes back to mythology. There's a, the band-aid on the back of Marcellus
128600	139080	Wallace's neck in Pulp Fiction and in the Coen Brothers movie. That's an old, something Jewish
139080	142520	about the thing on the back of the neck. Now, do you feel that was a one-time thing for tonight
142520	146760	or do you feel that that's gonna stay true throughout the entire show tonight? I'm, I'm,
146760	152600	oh, I'm on fire tonight. I'm gonna, I'm, God, God is above me, right above me, high noon.
154200	157720	Like, like, like, it's just, it's a harmonic convergence. I felt it when I was walking
157720	164760	through. They were playing some, what do you call that? R&B, hip-hop? Yes, hip-hop. I just felt like,
164760	168840	let's give them, let's not talk about it. Let's just fucking, it was phenomenal. What you don't
168840	172920	want to do is look at it and try to capture that same lightning bug in the same jar. No, no,
172920	178200	my biggest challenge, chef, my biggest challenge when I'm freestyle rapping is when I hear, like
178200	185240	you do, it's too good. It sounds written and you heard me address it in the thing. I was panicking.
186440	191240	I was like, oh shit, they're gonna think this is written. I'm not Eminem, I can't write it. Dan,
192440	197320	I don't have it. I'm like him except fuck your hand. Fuck your marker on your hand.
197320	201560	Was that your guilty conscience saying, this sounds written because I did prepare something?
201560	207880	No. I'm Shakespeare. Sounds written because it's fucking, God is writing it.
209960	214040	And so I'm like, guys, I'm sorry. It's like how a magician stops halfway through and he goes,
214040	219160	I'm sorry, I have to remind you again, nothing up my sleeve because this rabbit's just flying out
219160	224040	of hats. Anyways. Now, I mean, what I'm not gonna do, Dan, and I'm saying I'm not going to do this
224040	229720	because I don't want to ruin the experiment. I could play that same beat again and I think
229720	233800	you're in such a zone that you could even go further than that. I'm not going to. We're going
233800	239640	to save it for later at any point though. I feel like you need to be in that free fall state.
240440	245720	I'll tell you what, tonight, a little favor to you. Catch me off guard. Sneak up on me,
245720	251880	be like Cato in Pink Panther. Whatever, I'm mixing my references. You're close enough.
251960	260440	All right. The guy that Clouseau pays to keep him on his toes. Yeah, attack me. Come up behind me.
260440	267720	Try and catch me. You can't. Because you opened up with a real normal pitfall of saying in the mouth.
267720	272840	And then it has to be. Exactly. Because it's just like, vroom, vroom, vroom in the parking lot. Okay.
273320	283000	We're pornifying. Pornogrifying? Pornogrifying it. All right. We got a lot of stuff to do.
284280	288280	Here's my new segment. It's called Controversial Thoughts.
288280	304760	No. No. No. No. Okay. I don't know. That was not the time for it, but I like that you're
304760	308920	on your toes. All right. Because you're fucking nimble as a mountain goat tonight. What's going
308920	314280	on? You know how cockroaches? You probably don't know this. I provide knowledge. I drop it. I drop
314280	320120	science. I spit fire. I provide knowledge. Do you ever spit knowledge? Sometimes on an accident.
321880	327480	The cockroach has a photoreceptor in its legs. It's running before it knows why. When you turn
327480	332280	on the lights, the cockroach just start running. Its brain doesn't even, isn't even, has yet to
332280	336680	say, oh shit, I'm a cockroach. Its legs are going, you have to run. There's light. We're a cockroach.
336680	343800	When I hear that beat, Jeff, I start moving and wrapping because the street part of me
345480	350920	has its own tiny urban brain. I'm not saying urban people have a tiny brain.
352680	360840	Or that they're cockroaches. Oh boy. Oh boy. Well, like cockroaches, we, the urban people,
360840	367800	will never die. I speak on behalf of us. What is it about you that makes you so urban, Dan?
367800	371640	Because I'm from the streets. So that's the only, that's the only thing that you need.
371640	380600	I'm 52nd in Calumet, bitch. Milwaukee. Look it up. 53526. I think that was my area code.
381560	388840	Look it up. You'll see. There's a street there. All right. Controversial, controversial thoughts.
391320	396920	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
398600	402920	Okay. Clearly you weren't ready for that one. No, I was, all right.
405560	411640	Here's the thing. I saw Monuments Men. And I didn't, I don't know anything about
412280	416120	this aspect of history, but it seemed to me like Hitler was really into art.
417080	425560	And just, just like America and Europe and everybody, it seemed like, like poor people
425560	431160	just kill each other in wars and rich people just care about paintings. So I wasn't that moved by
431160	436680	George Clooney's like, uh, story about fat old men going into war to protect paintings from Hitler,
436680	440600	who was intent on building a giant Hitler museum to store all the paintings.
446120	450200	Yeah. Yeah. Yo. Yeah. Oh yeah. Controversial thoughts.
454600	458760	I mean, Aaron and I got in a fight about it. She's an artist. She's a visual artist.
458760	463240	Wait, what was the fight about? What side were you on and what side was she on?
463240	466600	Well, because I was, because I don't know. Who was on Hitler's side?
468520	474520	Me. Kind of. No, no, no. That's not true. That's not true at all. She kept accusing me of being
474520	480280	a Hitler side. The irony was I'm not on Hitler's side. I'm not an artist's side. I'm not an art
480280	485880	side because I kept going like, seems like art's kind of a, you know, we keep talking about art,
485880	489080	how important it is. Everyone agrees art and support is important. There's a scene in the
489080	493160	movie where they find they're looking for all this art. We're going to protect the art. And then
493160	497000	they find a bunch of gold and then like Eisenhower comes down. He's taking his picture with all the
497000	501560	gold and like two of the characters go, you know, they give a fuck about gold, but they don't give
501640	506840	a fuck about art. It's like, what's the fucking difference? There's just less art. It's like,
506840	511640	like, like the gold is like stacks of shit that everyone agreed was valuable. That's all art is.
511640	516600	And I was just like saying, Aaron was, Aaron burst into tears part of it, not because she
516600	519240	thought the movie was good, but because she actually, because she thought the movie was
519240	522920	profaning something that she cared a lot about. She was explaining, by the way, we're both drunk.
522920	527960	She's explaining all the way home. Like, oh, I just, you know, it's like, like Hitler, like he
527960	532840	wanted to, he wanted to destroy all the art that he didn't think was good. And, and, and that was
532840	536840	terrible. And there's, there's a scene where they blowtorch a bunch of art. And I was like, well,
536840	541640	that was scorched earth though. They were, they, the Hitler did a Nero doctrine where he said,
541640	547000	if I fall or if Germany falls, start destroying everything. So then the art was in trouble.
547960	553720	So I was, I was just like driving home with Aaron and going, uh, like what, I feel like,
553720	557480	I feel like all the rich people in the movie all agree that art is valuable and all the poor people
557480	563080	were just off camera, getting shot and blown up. And all of them were like, fuck art. Like there's
563080	569160	a bullet in my brain. And, uh, that's the side I was on. But she twisted that into me being pro Hitler
570120	574520	because I was like, he wanted to make a museum. He didn't want to make a museum. He wanted to make
574520	580360	a very big Hitler museum. That is not, uh, debatable. He declared lots of art, degenerate art,
580360	585480	but also there was just also, it was open season. If, if like Himmler or whoever, so I'm really into
585480	589320	such and such an artist that that was for you, like whether or not that was degenerate or not.
589320	595240	There was, it was just basically, let's just go pilfer and loot all of Europe. They stole all the
595240	598280	art, but they weren't going to open it. They weren't earning it. They were all going to go keep it
598280	603800	and hoard it because it was, you could equate that to worth money, worth gold. Yeah. Yeah. And that's
603800	612120	different from the Vatican how? Wow. You, uh, you made a leap there, man. That's different from the
612120	616680	Louvre. How that's different from, I mean, like, why are we, why are we all hoard art? We hanging
616680	620200	on the wall. We look at it. It's fucking great. So valuable. We all agree. It's valuable. Wow.
620200	625400	Look at this precious thing. It was one of a kind. Oh, gold is valuable because it's a rare element.
625400	631080	Aluminum is less valuable. I would say gold is more arbitrary, uh, a value of worth, uh,
631080	635880	just because it doesn't, uh, decay or oxidize or whatever. Like art, you could at least agree on
635880	641160	that it has beauty, has, uh, like, like intrinsic value to, to Himmler, but I don't think that's
641160	644280	what they were doing. I think there was just a bunch of asshole German guys going around there
644280	648600	and stealing shit that they wanted to belong to that. I don't think those guys had good taste.
648600	654040	I think the first person that'll tell you that is, uh, is, uh, an artist, someone in art school.
654040	658040	They can't wait to tell you what a mediocre artist Hitler was. You know why? Because otherwise
658040	662440	Hitler is just an artist. Everyone's going to tell you what a bad artist Hitler was because
662440	667480	otherwise you get to go, yeah, you artists, you know, you, you live in boxes and you eat poop for
667480	673400	living it, but, uh, give you a little bit of power and oh boy, I, I, I, I, I have, they gotta
673400	679000	go. Hitler doesn't count. Hitler doesn't count. It's really bad at perspective. I haven't seen,
679000	683800	I haven't seen the movie, but like there are like, you see films of like the German museums,
683800	688520	like during the Reich and that, and they, they, you know, like cleansed Europe or at least Germany
688520	693240	of all the degenerate art. And so there's all these, uh, like galleries full of like dramatic,
693240	698760	like just a bunch of like big macho statues and there's no, there's no emotion to it. It's
698760	705000	just really stark and, uh, and intimidating. Meanwhile, the Nazis that had taste were
705000	709400	scooping up all the Botticelli is not a really good shit and they were all just taking it like,
709400	713640	like, like we know that Hitler's not down for this, but we want a fucking gigantic basement
713640	721720	full of the stuff that we know that will always have value, right? Yes. So, uh, okay, look,
722520	726760	I don't, I, I, I probably won't see the movie. Is there a way to tell me what happens without,
726760	729560	without spoiling or is that the whole thing? Hitler loses all his art.
732120	737400	He loses all the art and we get it all back. You know, the, the, the, do we get it all back or
737400	742200	does something like, no, no, there's a bittersweet, like, oh, but we, we will never know what we
742200	746360	didn't get. There's points where they're holding up like bird frames and says Picasso on the bottom.
746360	751080	It's like we lost a fucking Picasso. Yeah, but also we lost a bunch of people and also like,
751160	757000	you know, like with, yeah, look, uh, Clooney came on Colbert and they showed a clip of him and that
757000	760360	Damon talking about how old they were and they're going to go save art paintings. It didn't seem
760360	767640	like a good movie. It's, uh, yeah, it's not, it's, it's, it's the, the concept of, of whether or not
767640	772200	a painting is worth more than human life. I think it's a very important one. And I think that you
772200	777000	need to, yeah, I mean, it just, you need to be cinematically. Cisco and Ebert weighed movies on
777000	782280	thumbs and some people weighed on stars. Uh, I feel a more accurate way to measure a movie's
782280	791000	value is through, uh, freestyle rapping. Yo, yo, monuments, man. Yo, yo, see it again. Yo,
791000	796840	see it at the IMAX or down the street. Fuck your daddy. On his feet. Go to monuments, man,
796840	803000	by George Clooney. I fucked your mom like my name was Hal Rooney. Mickey Rooney, a man.
803000	810040	Say it again. Go to see monuments on Friday. Fuck your mama on her eye. It was eye day.
810040	816280	I put it in my inner socket. Okay, look, it was about to rhyme with rocket.
818200	825240	I was going to go places. All right. New segment. Next segment. Okay. Do you want a different beat
825240	832040	or do you want to stick with that? I don't, I'm not in control. My new segment is called ruin it for me.
833560	840120	Yo, yo, ruin it for me. I'm happy about something. See, you're going to come up and ruin it for me.
843080	848840	Okay. So that was good for real. Don't base this. We can do a segment later called I want to be on
848840	855320	stage and we will not punish you for wanting to be on stage, but for real, like if you, if you
855320	859080	really think you can ruin this for me, because you've been thinking about it more than I have
859160	864200	because I heard, I saw one paragraph on the internet and I get excited and then I retweet it
864760	870200	and then I feel like my job is done and I live in a better world. The gay NFL guy,
871720	879960	the guy that we have our first openly gay NFL guy. That's all I know. That's it. I know one
879960	884200	tweet's worth of information. It's very uplifting to me. I would, I would imagine it's very hard to
884200	890200	be an openly gay NFL, a draft pick or whatever the hell it is. Sounds like our first gay sports
890200	903400	corner. Gay sports corner, gay sports corner. I mean, I want to yes and you, but that's really
903400	909640	a derailment. Like, because the segment is I'm happy about this current event that I know one
909720	914680	tweet's worth of information about. What I want is for somebody, because I, then I go to bed and I
914680	920600	go, you know, the world's getting better. Gay rights that takes a huge leap forward. Somebody,
920600	925400	somebody that's, that's in a position to be nothing but punished for it comes out and says,
925400	929320	Hey, I'm gay, which, which really is more symbolic of like the fact that, you know what,
929320	932840	your neighbor's probably gay. Like there's people who aren't admitting it and like, like it's not
932840	936440	weird to be gay and I'm a fucking, I can throw a football or I can catch it or whatever the hell
936440	941560	he does in that dumb ass sport. I'll become open-minded about that shit when I die.
950040	955880	Because those guys called me facts for a long time. But, but so, so that's it, right? I go to
955880	959400	bed, I sleep like a baby, but there's gotta be somebody in the room, right? Who can, who can
959400	963080	tell me, because this is how it always works. Like you, you mentioned it at a cocktail party and then
963080	967400	someone goes, yeah, but you know, that guy's a pedophile or that guy, that guy wasn't going to be,
967400	971640	he was the number three draft pick and he came out because he, it actually boosted him to number
971640	977720	one. So there's, is there anybody here that has like, like mitigating information to, to, to like
977720	982200	dilute this, this rainbow of joy? Uh, he has a room full of Hitler's art.
984200	989640	Then there's a guy, believe me, I don't know much about it either, but there was a guy,
989640	994680	he's going into the draft, right? He's a college player going into the NFL draft. And before he
994680	1000840	got drafted, he said, also I'm a homosexual, which might make him less marketable because
1000840	1006200	coaches are weird about putting distractions as they call it in their locker room. That could be
1006200	1009960	some guys two in the news or two of this or that. And I don't want to fuck up my locker room with
1009960	1015400	this or that. On ESPN news, there were people who are coaches who are pundits who come out and talk
1015400	1019480	about all sorts of issues. They all like, they were asked like, would that be distracting for
1019480	1024120	you? You were a coach once or you were a player once. And a lot of people came out and they really
1024120	1028360	didn't want to like say, cause they, there's certainly no market and say, yeah, I wouldn't
1028360	1031720	want to be in a room with that guy. They didn't, they don't say that what they did say, well,
1031720	1036280	you know, I do see the side of the locker room, you know, locker rooms, there's lots of different
1036280	1039960	kinds of people in there and different whatever. And you know, it can be a distraction. I mean,
1040040	1044200	oh, like, like, yeah, you're like, you basically just said that would be a problem for you.
1045240	1049240	And also other people have said, like, so somebody was asked, like some player was asked, how many,
1049240	1053480	like what percentage of NFL players currently do you think are gay? And he goes, I don't know,
1053480	1058440	anywhere between five and 80%. Like it's not zero. Well, that's for this don't ask, don't tell
1058440	1062440	thing where you went through this with the military. But I think, I think, I think a gay activist,
1062440	1067800	a man would tell, it would say that was into this would go, you know what? It's a fucking distraction
1068120	1073400	for the for the for the meter, the parking meter attendant that I'm getting on some level,
1073400	1078920	like, there's not equality yet. Like, somehow, even though I don't have to tell you where I put
1078920	1084680	my dick when I when I when I look for pleasure, somehow, it's a straight run society. And it's
1084680	1090360	blowing back on me like, and I'm somehow like, because straight people can run around high fiving
1090360	1094600	each other for being straight, you can put up billboards that have innuendo like, hey, come get
1094600	1100840	a bagel. It's kind of like fucking a pussy, right? And it's on some level, like Starburst
1100840	1106600	commercials, and it's a straight man's world. And and so there's like a certain amount of like,
1106600	1111400	like, like, if you come out of the closet, oh, yeah, and you're in a political position,
1112280	1116760	you know, there is, it's a risky proposition, like people like Kobe got in trouble for calling
1116760	1120040	somebody faggot like, like, like, but like, that's something you just like, like certain people just
1120040	1123480	say when they get angry. I don't know that was necessarily homophobic, which is something that
1123480	1127320	certain people just say, and people drop n bombs on each other, it doesn't necessarily mean they're
1127320	1132120	saying that. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. But I would imagine that any sports locker
1132120	1138600	room, you have a bunch of people who aren't necessarily like across the board, like PhDs,
1138600	1144440	and they're trained to be really good at one like athletic endeavor, there's going to be lots of like
1144440	1149480	visceral bullshit. And they're going to tease you about anything that you're different at. Let's
1149480	1154680	say you read a lot, but using that as a reason to like not draft people, then we have a problem
1154680	1159160	because we have systemic. That's the thing. And the thing is, because if this guy made it to the
1159160	1165800	college level, being into football, and being gay, well, the beauty of it, like the reason why it's
1165800	1169320	good for him is because he's like, I think he's like a graduate of some good school or something
1169320	1173320	like that, like, he's got a shit together. And he's, you know, like, like he's, he's not just some
1173320	1176760	any old knucklehead, like, would you actually have to be a representative? I think it's smart,
1176760	1180120	because what you don't want to do, which I think a lot of people, the reason why they can't come out,
1180120	1184360	if you're in a soccer locker room or a football or baseball locker room, and you've been playing
1184360	1188840	with these people for eight years, and you've been in the shower with them for eight years,
1188840	1192040	and you go, oh, by the way, the whole time that we've been doing dick jokes and doing all this,
1192040	1196600	like, grab-assing and all this weird male shit that we all do, I've always been gay the whole
1196600	1200840	time. Then you open yourself up to a whole other thing. He's saying, before you draft me, if this
1200920	1207720	ruins my career, I want everyone to know before I go in, I'm gay. Now, currently, my favorite fucking
1207720	1212840	thing in the world is, and I forget his name, but I love the Winter Olympics, and the cat that's gay
1212840	1220040	that calls the figure skating, what's his name? Reed? Weir. Johnny Weir? Yeah, John Weir. And he,
1220600	1225400	in Vladimir Putin's Russia, who has made it very clear that it's not cool to be gay there,
1226200	1231080	although he never has a shirt on, and is constantly straddling some sort of beast.
1232120	1237880	Johnny Weir comes out dressed like the fucking, like the Easter parade every time, and he's just
1237880	1243800	like, hello! And he's dressed like Peter Pan, and it's good. And he's got, like, he has the best
1243800	1248600	makeup on, and he couldn't. There's no way to be gayer than Johnny Weir is right now in Russia,
1248600	1252360	and he's basically saying, come arrest me on fucking camera, and that's great,
1252440	1258200	because the sport has to be full of gay people. Like, it has to be full of everything. And I love
1258200	1263720	the fact that Russia was homophobic, or is. And like, well, you know, but they can, so is America,
1263720	1269160	so is probably every government, like across the board in some ways. But Russia came out and said,
1269160	1277240	don't propagandize about your homosexuality. John Weir is just present in Russia as propaganda,
1277240	1284840	which is awesome. Don't propagandize homosexuality because we're all just a, just a tick away from
1285720	1291480	going homo if we see the right poster. They made it really ambiguous, like, well, like,
1291480	1295960	no gay propaganda. What does that mean exactly? Yeah, you know, don't be gay and be happy.
1297480	1303400	Don't jump around being gay. Keep it away from the kids. So if I walk by a child,
1303560	1309160	like, they left it pretty fucking loose. All right. Well, so so I'm leaving at that. I'm not
1309160	1313000	going to stretch this out. Let's say there's 150 people in this room. I said, ruin it for me. It
1313000	1317240	doesn't sound like this guy. Sounds like sounds like he made getting drafted a little more
1317240	1323240	difficult in the 11th hour by doing by doing this amazing. Because there might be some coaches who
1323240	1328200	say I don't want that quote unquote distraction. Why bother? And you could fall back on I'm not
1328200	1334920	homophobic, but it's a distraction. So he had he had that horrible empire of mediocrity working
1334920	1339800	against him worse than worse than having like, like active aggression working against him. He
1339800	1345000	had actual just status quo, stagnation working against him, just gravity. Let's say you're,
1345000	1350520	let's say you're a coach of the, like, the Patriots and say, oh, I make up a team like,
1350520	1356520	like the the flim flammers. And, and you have a quarterback that is worth all the money in the
1356520	1362200	league. And you as a coach happen to know that this guy's a rampant homosexual. Rampant? Oh, yeah.
1364200	1370120	Rampant. He, as soon as the lights go down, he is, he's, he's, he's, he's just gay bashing.
1373160	1376760	Is he rampant homophobe or rampant homosexual? I'm sorry, did I say that? I meant homophobe.
1376760	1384040	Oh, rampant homophobe. Okay. That's why it was rape and homosexual. I'm sorry. I said rampant.
1384040	1387400	I went in a whole different, a whole different direction. But let's say like you as a coach,
1387400	1392600	know that a certain percentage of your team are homophobic and they're worth a zillion dollars.
1392600	1399240	Like, do you want to bring out like a linebacker in who causes distress? Capitalism, mediocrity,
1399240	1405400	path of least resistance, people doing what they do, wanting today to be as easy as yesterday.
1405400	1410920	Those are the things that heroes rise up against. That's not, not, not when it's fashionable, not
1411560	1417160	when you can goad people to throw lettuce at you and somehow garner that into like a murder story,
1417160	1421560	which is what I often do in my own little world. You know, like, like somebody that rises up and
1421560	1425160	goes like, you know what, I could have fucking just hung out forever with this toupee on,
1425160	1431960	but I'm bald, motherfucker. I got it. My, my scalp itches. And actually it wasn't even about
1431960	1437000	selfishness. Like you said, there's an actual, there's a courtesy to that, to go like, you know
1437000	1441320	what? So that seven years later, when we got our Super Bowl rings, like you, I want you to
1441320	1445960	have gotten it with, with a gay guy in the locker room. I don't want you to, I don't want this to
1445960	1451000	be a story that, that, that somehow brings us back down into the gutter about showers and all this
1451000	1456360	shit. Anyways, let's, that's enough of that. But, but, but my point wasn't so much about, you know,
1456360	1460280	we're in LA, we can, we can, we can love gay people all we want. But my point was more like
1460280	1464840	in this age, like you hear these heroic things and like, you know, there's a spin on them. And then
1464840	1469720	so often, like you read one more paragraph down or you click on one comment in the comment section,
1469720	1474040	it just starts to fall apart because of relativity and all this stuff. But it sounds like a pure
1474600	1480760	hero story. Are you hoping that somebody did mitigate that? No, I'm glad nobody did. I know,
1480760	1485240	no wrong answer is if somebody came up and ruined it, that's good too. I wouldn't, I like, like,
1485240	1489160	that's interesting as well. I like that. That would show us that there's no such thing as
1489160	1494120	like fucking heroes. Like, like, like, would Julian Assange like, like, like get tangled up
1494120	1498440	in some weird sexual stuff? It's like a Martin Luther King, like he, like the first thing they
1498440	1502680	go after is his crotch, you know, like, like he's cause he's causing trouble. I just like, like,
1502680	1507000	maybe what we need to learn is that we're not supposed to be looking for these non-human people.
1507560	1511640	Just so happens that this guy sounds like inhumanly awesome. All right, enough of that,
1511640	1514040	whatever his name is, and he plays a dumb sport, so he's a fucking idiot.
1514040	1520920	And that is a prejudice I will go to my grave with. And that, and that
1520920	1527240	segment is called Burying the Lead. That's why I'm especially inspired by it because it means
1527240	1531320	people can do heroic things even when they're, when they're so not bright that they play football
1531320	1538120	for their whole lives. I think that's inspiring that lizard people can also be, be heroic.
1538120	1545880	I'm making, I'm kidding. I'm sure there's great football players out there. Come on the show,
1545880	1551080	we'll talk to you. We'll have a special microphone that picks up on whatever wave likes you speak in.
1553880	1557400	Yeah, it won't, it won't block the pathway through your mouth so you can breathe.
1560280	1564600	I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. How good do you think you would be as an,
1564680	1569000	if you're not the world's greatest interviewer, how good do you think you would be with a
1569000	1576280	famous, highly educated, black, gay, NFL, uh, draftee? Uh, I, I don't know. That sounds kind
1576280	1582920	of awesome. Is this guy black, by the way? Yes. Oh, fuck, he's awesome. I just automatically
1582920	1589800	pictured like this, this, like, this, like honky, corn fed, kind of like Woody, Woody Harrelson guy.
1589800	1594120	Why is that better than he's black? Because black people are even more awesome than gay people. Like,
1594120	1598920	I don't know. That's amazing because he's got even less reason as a black man to come out of
1598920	1604360	the closet. That's fucking her. Are you kidding me? Like there's a horribly entrenched homophobic
1604360	1609480	culture. Um, uh, like, like, like that's accepted because we don't, we don't have to explain this.
1609480	1612840	We'll be, the show will be two hours long, but it will be, but we're going to talk about other stuff.
1613880	1618520	No, it's as what my white guilt and my, my straight guilt make this guy being gay and
1618520	1621960	black fucking amazing. I'm almost willing to forgive him for playing football.
1625000	1629320	Uh, I would, I would, I would love to talk to him about, I mean, how do you, how do you,
1629320	1633000	so now that he's black, you run on the show, he's not a lizard man anymore. Now that he's black,
1633000	1635720	no, I would have, I would have wanted to talk to him no matter what his race was.
1636760	1642920	And that's on the record. No, but come on, except for, fuck you, fuck you. I'm not apologetic about
1642920	1649800	my glee about wanting like people who have reasons to be afraid being like not afraid.
1650360	1656520	Uh, I think that's fucking amazing. Um, anyways, let's, let's, speaking of being afraid and being
1656520	1662200	activated and, and, and all kinds of stuff, I want to move forward. Uh, we, we gotta, we gotta, uh,
1662200	1666840	guest tonight that I mentioned last week because I felt like last week I complained about
1666840	1671400	Uber. I complained about, I complained about, uh, I don't know how hard it is for me to scratch my
1671400	1678120	ass and jerk off into a laptop. The theme last week was kind of like, uh, it was sort of like,
1679640	1684120	it was, it was first world problems to be sure. And I'm not, I'm not ashamed of that. I'm in the
1684120	1688920	first world. I have problems. I'm not going to, but I also like kind of came to this epiphany
1688920	1694520	during that as I have often like, yeah, but I'm 41. I don't give a shit. Like I gotta start
1694520	1697800	figuring out what's going on with the world, but I don't believe in politics. I don't buy into the
1697800	1703240	liberal versus conservative shit. I, I, I think that the fucking government is an asshole and
1703240	1707640	people who aren't systems aren't assholes. And so the thing that really appeals to me at a blush
1707640	1712680	that I know nothing about is this concept of net neutrality. And I happen to know through Aaron,
1712680	1716360	this net neutrality activist and his name is Eddie Geller and he's here.
1716360	1729560	Thank you. Thank you so much. It's my favorite part of the show. I get to sit down.
1731800	1736840	Perfect. All right. So I purposely didn't research because that's my passion is for doing
1736840	1743560	nothing. Like I, I, I know for sure that the, the, the, the words net neutrality mean that,
1743880	1748040	that, that the internet is a, is a perfect place where everybody can do whatever the hell they
1748040	1753560	want. And that must mean that there's some FCC types coming and got in for us that are trying
1753560	1757000	to make sure that there's some kind of law going down the road. That's going to protect
1757000	1760920	the interests of corporations and things and ultimately marginalize the pork. You take it
1760920	1766760	from there. Yes. You pretty much nailed it. So net neutrality is essentially the default way
1766760	1772600	that we think about the internet, that you're free to go anywhere and go to any sites and any,
1772600	1777480	anyone who starts a website can get to you. It's this free flow of information. And, and so the
1777480	1782360	reason net neutrality has been in the news is because the, the government agency that oversees
1782360	1787880	this, the FCC had these net neutrality rules that they made in 2010. They said, all right,
1787880	1792360	if you are Comcast or your Time Warner, you can't fuck with people's internet. You have to let them
1792360	1798520	go where they want. And those rules just got tossed out in the DC circuit court. So now it's
1798520	1803640	like they're in the, uh, when the internet first started, we kind of had some net neutrality rules
1803640	1809000	and then those, uh, those got deregulated and we were in this wild West for a little bit. And then
1809000	1814280	these new net neutrality rules, and I apologize that this is a little, uh, you know, goes a little
1814280	1818520	in the weeds, but these newer net neutrality rules, which were kind of a half measure got thrown out.
1818520	1823800	So we're back in the wild West. So right now it's an open table. It's a, yeah, it's essentially
1823800	1829160	anything could happen, but these in deadwood, you've got your Hearst moving into town. He's,
1829160	1834680	he's there. He's got his resources, but you've also got your, uh, swear engines and your,
1834680	1837560	your other people like, like, like whoever shoots who first.
1838360	1843080	Exactly. Well, and the other thing that happened this week is Comcast is attempting to buy Time
1843080	1849160	Warner cable. So Comcast is the biggest provider of internet and TV trying to be by the second
1849160	1856040	biggest provider. And so we're talking about a giant mega corporation that has enormous control
1856040	1861400	over everyone's communications. So everyone, remember when I, I, I, you seem a little younger
1861400	1867320	than me when, when I was a lad, uh, that phrase Time Warner didn't exist. There was, there was
1867320	1872920	a time and there was a Warner brothers, right? And now Comcast is going to merge with Time Warner.
1872920	1877080	Yeah. That is, that's what they're going to try and do. And so this is, and so net neutrality
1877080	1881240	activists, you know, such as myself, you know, we see this as, this is a terrible thing. You know,
1881240	1886520	we don't need less companies in, in control of our communication. So when we talk about being
1886520	1891960	in control, because now I went, I went to, I went to Europe recently and I was in a hotel room and
1891960	1896600	there was like a way for me to get, I could get free internet. It was free wifi that seemed to
1896600	1903080	be somehow in the ether, almost like a kind of ether internet. Um, I didn't have to give a credit
1903080	1906280	card number. I could get on the internet by putting, I don't know, I think I had to put my
1906280	1909960	email address in or something like that, but it was certainly, and I don't know how I found this
1909960	1914680	out, but the porn was definitely blocked. Like it was a, it was sort of like a, it was sort of like
1914680	1922040	a Disney, Disney-fied kind of internet. Is that the world that was like, like, like when we talk
1922040	1927400	about companies like Comcast and Warner cable, because they offer a cable internet is the idea
1927400	1933080	that they're going to offer, they think that they, they see a world where internet is like cable.
1933080	1938840	Yes. And that they're, they can offer these sort of packages. Right. And this, you know, that they,
1938840	1945560	that they can make their content go faster and run better for you at home. And then other people,
1945560	1950360	you know, uh, smaller websites or other people making content are going to, you know, have a
1950360	1954360	second-class internet. So you go to the president's website, who's telling you, Hey, it's, I'm the
1954360	1958920	president. I had an Easter egg roll and a car wash and I love guns or I hate guns. I mean,
1958920	1963640	either case, like fucking pay attention to me. And it's like, whoosh, comes through you at maximum
1963640	1967080	bandwidth. And then you go to a geo cities page where someone's like, fuck the president,
1967080	1971400	fuck the government. I think all governments align. It's like, you can't read the first three words.
1971400	1975800	Uh, it's, it's slowly loading. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then actually something like that
1975800	1981400	actually happened in Canada where, uh, this, uh, telecom had its union was striking against them.
1981400	1986920	And so the telecom blocked the website to the union. So it's, you know, it, it's like,
1986920	1990280	we see these little things that are, that are fucked up and it's not all going to happen
1990280	1994040	tomorrow. It's like tomorrow, the internet is not going to all be this like dire situation,
1994040	1997560	but these are the things they're capable of doing. But we might as well be talking about
1997560	2003400	telegraph neutral neutrality or telephone, telephonic neutrality, which are a lot that
2003400	2008600	you said the FCC is involved. The FCC shouldn't even fucking exist anymore because the insane
2008600	2013160	thing is that the reason they existed, this is me going back to my night, uh, freshman year
2013160	2019560	communications, uh, class. But what I understand about the FCC is that the reason they exist is
2019560	2025560	because, uh, there was this thing called radio and we just invented it. And we thought that it was
2025560	2031560	like a big pie and, uh, each, each slice was a frequency and you could, well, we need the
2031560	2036280	government's help so that everyone can have radio. Everyone gets a slice and we got to make sure
2036280	2041640	that nobody gets too big a slice or that there's not enough slices, uh, blah, blah, blah. Cut to
2041640	2046760	these people telling you that Janet Jackson's titty is offensive during the Superbowl. It makes
2046760	2051080	no sense. There's nothing to do with anything because far since the FCC was established,
2051080	2055720	we found out that there's no such thing as limitations on, on, on frequency. It doesn't
2055720	2061400	matter. And they, but the thing about government is that God bless them. They're only trying to
2061400	2067320	help probably usually, but they never fucking go away. Once they're around, they never go away.
2067320	2071640	And I'm not being a libertarian by saying that. I'm just being a human being and saying,
2071640	2076600	once you invite these guys into your life and they start telling you like, like, like, like,
2076600	2080440	no one's ever going to have a meeting where they go, so that's it. FCC is finished, huh?
2081640	2088520	All in favor, uh, no more FCC. It never happens. So they're still around and it doesn't look,
2088520	2093400	why are they still around? Well, no. And I think like stuff like the, you know, the Janet Jackson
2093400	2098200	nipple thing is, is ridiculous. But there is also a school of thought, which I, you know,
2098200	2104200	subscribe to, which is like in an ideal world, we want someone like the FCC, you know, to say that
2104200	2108200	these, you know, Comcast the world can not, you made it sound like they were protecting us, uh,
2108200	2113480	in an ironic twist. Yeah. Well, I mean, on the internet. So it's like, you know, the FCC has
2113480	2119160	sort of a wide purview of things they do. And so the hope would be that on the grounds of the
2119160	2124040	internet that they would tell these, you know, these huge corporations that you cannot fuck with
2124040	2128280	people's access. Right. And that, I mean, and that's a totally different story than, you know,
2128280	2132600	Janet Jackson's nipple, you know, this is, you know, clearly two different things, but I totally
2132600	2136280	get your point. Right. Right. All right. So let's, let's, let's, let's set up the chess board right
2136280	2140280	now. And hopefully you can explain it to me like where the pawns are, where the Kings are, et cetera.
2140280	2144600	We've got all of us who don't give a shit about anything, who would never impinge on anyone's
2144600	2149560	right to do anything. Uh, everyone listening to me, everyone in this room, every human being with,
2149560	2154680	that was born with a beating heart. We've got all those people now that now we've got those people
2154680	2160120	all like the done deal. No one's ever going to fucking vote for anything or do anything unless
2160120	2164920	they're operating on some kind of weird agenda. Now. So, so now let's bring in the corporations.
2164920	2169560	What, what, what, what, what is their relationship with the government in all of this? They,
2170200	2176280	well, so if, um, if the FCC, I'll go back to that for a sec. If the FCC actually wanted to do
2176280	2181240	something, wanted to be really good and go back to regulating the internet the way it had been when
2181240	2186440	it first started and really like put the hammer down, then what would happen is these corporations
2186440	2192040	who have enormous lobbying power would actually tell Congress to be like cut the funding for the
2192040	2197400	FCC, not necessarily destroy it, but you know, uh, deplete it severely. So, I mean, there,
2197400	2201400	there's so much power and they have so much influence lobbying, not only Congress people,
2201400	2207080	but going to the FCC and lobbying the people who work over there. So I mean, it's, it's a gigantic
2207080	2210680	foe. I mean, there's no two ways. Now my brain's a balloon animal because I'm really realizing the
2210680	2214280	extent to which I started babbling about the FCC and how it should go fuck itself. And you're,
2214280	2219000	you're like the biggest fan because it's like the government is like, like the only recourse of us
2219000	2222920	being like a European nation where it's like they're protecting us somehow. I know nothing about
2222920	2226760	this. What's the danger that they will actually control certain content based on like, like,
2226760	2232840	if, if Fox controls Comcast or whatever, they want to control certain like political content or,
2232840	2238520	well, there'll be, I mean, we'll go ahead. Oh, uh, well, um, uh, that, well, the fears that Comcast
2238520	2244120	would, you know, prioritize their own content and block and slow down content. That's not theirs.
2244120	2248040	Were you talking about that or the FCC? I mean, I was going to like an Orwellian kind of like,
2249720	2254360	I'm all in for Orwellian physically, geographically. Let's look at it like a map
2254360	2258840	of the city and let's pretend that the internet is traffic. Yeah. Like it's the streets,
2258840	2263560	it's the infrastructure. So I think that's why you're saying the FCC needs to be involved because
2263560	2267400	the government needs to be involved in which lights turn green at which time and which,
2267400	2272840	whether which streets are widened in which or not. And if you, if you privatize the city streets,
2272840	2279480	then the, the, the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Pinkberry, uh, is going to go, okay, where are you going?
2279480	2284920	You're going over to, uh, mom pops, uh, uh, yogurt shop, uh, at rush hour. And you know what,
2284920	2289320	we got to close that street down anyway. It's like, you know, like we're, we're giving,
2289320	2295480	privatizing things that everyone uses is never a good idea. I'll go out on a limb here, be in
2295480	2299400	health education. So where do we stand right now? Are we in some sort of crisis right now? Like,
2299400	2303640	is it like, is it, are we in the balance right now? Well, yeah, we're, it's kind of precarious
2303640	2308680	right now. So the FCC is, you know, is saying actually now that these rules have been thrown
2308680	2313480	out there concerning what they're going to do next. They say they still care about net neutrality,
2313480	2318280	though the new head of the SEC is a former communications lobbyist, which shouldn't
2318280	2322680	surprise anyone that that's pretty much how our government works. But the hope is that,
2322680	2328040	you know, I, it's, we were talking in the back about how, you know, hopeless this might be.
2328040	2333880	And you know, that might be true, but like, you know, activists, you know, people I work with,
2333880	2337000	you know, it's like our only thing, it's like, well, we got to fucking do something. Like,
2337000	2342360	even if it's a petition, and we have to like, you know, go down to DC and yell at these people,
2342360	2347240	you know, what we're saying in the green room was like, like, because Kumail said, like,
2347240	2350360	man, you guys got to I mean, this stuff's so important. And then everyone has such a
2350360	2354040	short attention span, you guys got to call it change it from net neutrality to like,
2354040	2360200	but fun or something. And it's like, yeah, but like, like, the real danger, the real problem is
2360200	2365400	that, like, we we're competing with people who work legislatively, bureaucratically,
2366200	2371720	their joy in life is to hang out, push buttons, yes, no vote on this, I believe in this system,
2372920	2377880	the problem is that the beating heart of humanity, the regular person who just wants to hang out and
2377880	2383560	live their life pursue their happiness, they don't they, you can convince them to get invested in
2383560	2389560	toppling over a statue of a horrible monster, you can convince them to like, like sign a petition,
2389560	2395080	you can convince them to, to stand on the on their desks and say, Captain, my captain,
2395080	2398920	that they we love those moments, because we're dramatic people. And we love stories,
2398920	2403480	what we don't love is long hard fucking slogs against the forces of night, because that's
2403480	2408760	called working at a DMV. But we don't we don't want to hang out and fucking go from three to six,
2408760	2413240	I guess I got to get on the internet and click this so that we can keep our internet free.
2413240	2418360	There's got to be a way for us to because and also it's like, like, what we're talking about,
2418360	2423960	like, now they've now they've convinced us that like the the it's a fight between the government
2423960	2429160	and corporations. Jesus Christ, who the fuck wants either of these guys to win that fight? This
2429160	2435160	internet was kind of ours. I mean, like, they like, we have a chance to keep it, take it,
2435160	2438840	fucking keep it. Christian Slater is supposed to come along and save us from all that.
2440840	2445160	By pumping up the volume. Are you talking about gleaming the cube? I don't know which Christian
2445160	2450440	Slater move. I mean, I'm saying he's supposed to come along in some way. I mean, like, I have no
2451880	2457960	getting into the gritty of who owns the internet. Like, for a long time, the answer has been kind of
2457960	2463960	up in the air. And what we don't want is for that to have an answer ever. Right. The way that we
2463960	2470520	kind of didn't want the days of manifest destiny. It was like, okay, we're just gonna we're gonna
2470520	2474360	make a nation. And then there was a war between the people who wanted one big old country and
2474360	2478360	the people who wanted each state to be independent. And then we we get tricked into thinking that we
2478360	2482040	have to choose between one good guy and one bad guy. And it's like, they're all a bunch of fucking
2482040	2488840	politicians. Right? No, and I and I actually, I totally agree with your butt fun theory of
2488840	2493800	change. And I really, it's kumail's butt fun theory. It might have been fun, but I'm not sure
2493800	2501240	I don't want to defame. But I really think that so in Iceland, there's a politician called Jan
2501240	2506520	Narn. He was a comedian. And he started this joke party called the best party. And they promised
2506520	2515240	like free towels, and that they would listen to women. And just like, like making free towels.
2516680	2521400	And so crazy, it started off as this joke, and then became like a real thing. And he actually
2521400	2526200	got attention and became the mayor of Iceland. And so that's, and our because it continued to
2526200	2532040	be entertaining. Right. Exactly. The way Walking Dead does the way the way True Detective does the
2532040	2536920	way like we've got a nation of people who can agree on one thing for sure you got our devotion,
2536920	2543000	if it suits our consumption, right? devotion without consumption is tyranny.
2545160	2551960	No, I think like that, like, I thank the crowd for being in it for this wonky sort of discussion,
2551960	2555560	but that no, they like listening. They're into it. And if they're not fucked up,
2556840	2560360	like, I hate to sound thick about this, but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be afraid of right
2560360	2563640	now, the government or the corporation or what to figure something out. We don't have to figure
2563640	2568600	out today. What am I supposed to be like, where am I supposed to aim my BB gun? You should be
2568600	2573640	you should be for net neutrality. I certainly am. But I don't I don't know who I'm what building
2573640	2579400	I'm supposed to go toilet paper right now. Well, I mean, I think if you know, the corporations,
2579400	2583960	I hate to sound so simplistic, would be the bad guys in this situation. And if you're an average
2583960	2589080	citizen, then you are hopefully telling the FCC telling your representative that you want net
2589080	2593000	neutrality. And, you know, you're trying to counterbalance you're saying the head of the FCC
2593000	2599400	is a former lobbyist. He is. But I mean, you know, if they only hear one side, you know, then we're
2599400	2606520	doubly fucked. And so it's like, yes, the system is totally, you know, you know, going against us.
2606520	2611560	But like, you know, we, we go and we yell at them when we can. But isn't the internet punk rock
2611640	2616600	enough? Like when they came after Napster, we all used to a long time ago, go get music for free,
2616600	2620280	and then that like peer to peer stuff, we always get what everyone then that became illegal. But
2620280	2624520	then gradually, we all go, okay, fuck it. iTunes, 99 cents and Spotify comes along, there's a way to
2624520	2629800	monetize that we pay for that. It always seems like the internet finds a way to make it egalitarian
2629800	2636200	and to make it like, like freebie and sexy and punk rock. Wouldn't like aren't there enough cool,
2636200	2640040	like a revolution? We're talking about the actual structure of the internet. So there's
2640200	2644520	I'm saying, is there no way to get underneath that and to subvert that or no? I mean, there are
2644520	2652040	people who talk about that. And but it's not something that one should count on or looks like
2652040	2656040	it would be any sort of viable option. I mean, actually, we're it sounds like the only heroes
2656040	2662120	right now that you can actually rely on are the hackers are the anonymous people that the people
2662120	2666920	who are simply anarchists are simply in favor of subversion. And of course, you can't rely on them
2666920	2672360	to to do anything but corrode, which is what I want them to do. If there were ever another revolution,
2672360	2678520	like in the way that we revolted against the English and the way certain countries revolt
2678520	2684600	against empires, the next revolution would have to be like an information one would have to be
2684600	2688760	it wouldn't it wouldn't be a country. Again, I mean, there's certainly there was there was still
2688760	2693160	the countries that revolt against their Imperial masters, but the next one would have to be us
2693240	2700360	revolting against a a control like that. I feel like it's going to be lead pipes in the street
2700360	2704760	because of information. Well, yeah. Well, because like when there are riots and, you know, people
2704760	2708920	people go protest against the, you know, the World Trade Organization, whatever. The first they do
2708920	2713720	is they switch off your cell phones that you can't tax if you do your you go to jail and they will
2713720	2718440	make it. And I think they're going to do that here. And I think that yeah, I foresee like the
2718440	2722920	moment they switch off our fucking funds, though, we will have to revert to lead pipe technology
2722920	2726920	because that's all we will have in our fingertips. Yeah. And we won't know how to fucking make a
2726920	2731960	lead pipe because we won't be able to Google how how to make lead pipes. Well, so Google it now.
2733640	2738200	Print it out. That's what we're saying. Like, like, like, like, I want revolution. I mean,
2738200	2741800	I don't want to live in a time where there is revolution because upheaval is a bummer and
2741800	2746200	everybody starts 40 year olds. Yeah, I don't have the back for it. It's a big fucking drag.
2746760	2750360	It's nice to live in a country or to live in a world where there has been a revolution
2750360	2755160	in the last century because we're all the beneficiaries of incredibly
2755160	2759400	rebels, the not paintings, men and women that stood up and fucking did crazy things.
2761240	2765160	The lights will go out for a while. And when they shut the lights out on us now,
2765160	2770280	it's the lights out in a whole different way. Like you and I, Dan, and I don't know how old you
2770280	2775000	any I'm 30. Yeah. So I mean, so like we talked about this before, like there was a time when
2775000	2778840	lights went out and it didn't mean that much. You lit a candle and you didn't have a fucking
2778840	2783400	cell phone anyway. Like now the moment they start fucking with our ability to communicate
2783400	2787640	with each other on the level that we're used to, um, people are going to lose their minds.
2787640	2791000	So there has to be a weird kind of ludite revolution because for the people that are
2791000	2794280	the biggest fans of the technology, these costs, it's called steampunk, bro.
2795560	2800920	We have to start talking to each other. Now we have to create a network of Dixie cups and strings
2802120	2807640	to prepare to doomsday prep for the man coming down on us. I mean, I gotta tell you, Eddie,
2807640	2811000	like I'm, I, I think, I think you're one of these people that's like, like you have the
2811000	2814600	practical solution and you're the one that actually is practical about it. And I feel
2814600	2820040	like just as dumb would be Han Solo who's, who's decided that he's going to do nothing
2820040	2825400	and that that's more convenient because as like, I feel, I feel bad for a genuine,
2825400	2831000	hardworking, erstwhile net neutrality activist who has found themselves in the position of
2831000	2839960	petitioning a fucking corrupt government official, uh, in hopes that they'll protect
2839960	2845240	them more than you'll play. Yeah, I know. And no, thank you for that. There's gotta be a,
2845240	2850200	there's gotta be a way around this. There's gotta be a way we can just flip this whole cop car over
2851000	2855320	because we have net neutrality right now and we should use it in a sign of fucking,
2856280	2859320	Eddie, who are your sights set on right now? If there's a car, I mean,
2859960	2864200	metaphorical car, you could flip over without flipping over an actual car. Like what is it?
2864200	2870280	Uh, that's a good question. I, I haven't thought about it in those terms. Um, you know, I guess
2870280	2879080	I blew up the puppies first net neutrality over. I feel like, like, tell me what to point my, uh,
2879080	2886040	my confusion or anger or rage at, you know, I, this like, and this goes a little outside the
2886040	2892600	bounds, but I mean, we, you know, we have such a fucked up system of campaign financing that all
2892600	2897800	that, you know, I think everyone who hears this and is in this room, like knows that, you know,
2897800	2904360	elections are run on money. And I think until it, thank you very much. And you know, like until we,
2904360	2909000	that guy's wearing a top hat. That's not the only guy that agrees with you. That's just the only guy
2909000	2914520	that thinks that was a great time to clap. Not that that was a wrong time, sir. I'm going to
2914520	2922120	clap him clapping. Good job. So I, you know, in the larger scale, like, and that's actually the
2922120	2927560	last, the last place I worked was working on sort of money and politics stuff. I mean, I think that
2927560	2933160	is so unsexy, but I think it's at the core, you know, it's this sort of like first issue until we
2933160	2939720	find a way to do, you know, for instance, a small dollar funded campaigns or anything like that. And
2939720	2944840	that's not flipping the car over. You know, it's totally not fun, but that is, no, I mean, that is,
2944840	2950440	that is like the biggest goddamn change that has to happen. And I was like dipping your pinky toe
2950440	2954840	into that water. All of a sudden you're tainted with your first things first, buddy. When you
2954840	2960280	come through here, are you liberal, conservative, you liberal, conservative. I am against
2960280	2966040	fucking capitalism being involved in civil service. I am invited. Like, like, I don't think that
2966040	2974760	there's, we know, we yell at Olympians when they take money from Wheaties. Like we want them to be
2974760	2980280	nonprofessional. Like we police when we want to, we figure out ways to keep money out of stuff
2980280	2986680	when it behooves us. We have a, we have a whole bunch of people who are willing to jump into the
2986680	2992520	now neutral internet in search of finding ways to keep money from flowing around. It's, there's a
2992520	2998520	lot of easy ways to keep money from flowing around when it comes to the fucking old white dudes that
2998520	3004200	we elect to say yes or no to all this bullshit that is supposed to be, at the end of the day,
3004200	3008200	should be the easiest thing in the world. It's like, what do my constituents want? What are the,
3008200	3012440	how does this affect people in Connecticut? Oh, it affects apples? People love apples in Connecticut.
3012440	3018920	Okay, done. Instead of that guy having somehow been compromised. That's insane. It's insane that
3019320	3022600	the presidency is involved in that. It's insane that we only have two candidates
3023240	3026760	from two parties. It's insane that there's two parties. It's insane that we think that that's
3026760	3031480	what government is. It's insane that we're taught that in high schools. It's, it's all from money.
3031480	3037560	It's all a bunch of goddamn fucking bullshit. I would say Eddie Stanton, let's bring Camille
3037560	3039960	out here in case he has something to say with Eddie. Camille, not Johnny.
3039960	3050680	Hello Camille. Hello, Eddie. Good to see you again. Jeff.
3052040	3057240	I wrote on a website that if you say people's names to them, they'd trust you more. Jeff.
3059080	3065080	Thanks Camille. See, it works. I like you more. I know, but if you push it, you become a creepy
3065080	3071640	guy. I know, I know people who do that Camille. And here's the thing about that Camille. If you
3071640	3077640	do it more to like more than three times in a minute, Camille, the thing is like it starts to
3077640	3081960	take on this. Yeah. Like I called American Airlines for a problem and they sent my name way
3081960	3087640	too many times. And I was like, please stop saying my name. And then they tweeted an apology
3087640	3092600	with my name in it. You know what I can't date with the fucking, when you're on with AT&T or
3092600	3097480	American Airlines or fucking whatever. Yeah. I go, this AT&T. Yeah. I just want to make sure that
3097480	3101720	my, I just got my new internet service, whatever. I can actually help you with that. Actually,
3101720	3106120	what was going to happen, they keep saying actually. Yeah. Even they're surprised they
3106120	3112120	can do something. Whoa, this is the first time this has happened. Well, I can actually help you
3112120	3119160	with that. I can actually do something about that. I can actually make a check out for you.
3119960	3125960	I can literally assist you right now. That's your job. It is weird because you're like,
3125960	3130600	it's this huge, like amorphous corporation and you're talking to like one head of it right then.
3130600	3136920	And they literally have almost no power. I do that when anyone calls me up. I just changed over.
3136920	3143160	I finally, I found out by the way, the surprise, no one who listened to the show. I didn't realize
3143160	3149000	that I've had DSL forever and I didn't know. I didn't like dick sucking lips. We all knew, is it?
3152760	3160200	Jeff. Well, now that you say his name like that, now I see it. I said the way he said it,
3160200	3163400	it sounded like a disease. I did not assume that I had state of the art internet access,
3163400	3169080	but he said, I didn't know it. I've had DSL this whole time. Oh yeah. He did. I should have known
3169080	3177800	it because my pinky always twitches. I am talking about sucking dick. It has nothing to do with
3177800	3184760	sucking dicks. It's just about the quality, like the fullness of the lips. DSL. Yes. Yeah. I got,
3184760	3191320	what is going on? Go ahead. People respect your lips. They want them on their dick. It doesn't
3191320	3195320	mean that you, they don't have any opinion about it. It means when you see my lips, you wish they
3195400	3200040	were on your dick. Yeah. They're like, those are, those are beautiful full lips. They're full lips
3200040	3207160	and in an abstract way, it would be great if they were around my dick in an abstract theoretical
3207160	3217560	way. Wow. Jeff. So I'm on the phone with, whenever the telemarketers ever call me up,
3217560	3221000	I use their name back at them and it fucking bums them out. They don't like it.
3221960	3225480	Hello. This is Leslie from AT&T. Hello, Leslie. How are you doing today?
3228360	3230920	I go, Leslie, what's going on with you? I just wanted to go, oh, come on, Leslie.
3232200	3237960	Cat got your tongue. They don't fucking dig it. So fucking, yeah, you can, you can reverse the
3237960	3243160	fucking. Yeah. I feel so bad for them. Now you're just staring at my lips like a weirdo.
3243880	3249720	It's not so weird. Isn't there a way. You can't suck your dick with lips.
3249720	3253880	Isn't there a way, even though, even though it doesn't, are you just getting horrible,
3253880	3260360	toothy blow jobs? No, a blow job is more than lips. I know, but that's what it starts.
3261880	3266200	You know, you, you've got dick sucking. You've got dick sucking eyes. Thank you.
3271400	3278680	Isn't there a way to keep the internet exactly the way it is, even though it doesn't profit anybody
3278840	3283960	and there's no one that needs to be shot or. Every time I shut my computer off, for some reason,
3283960	3289240	like whatever my homepage would be, it was like a Yahoo, my, my, once in a while,
3289240	3293000	every fucking couple of weeks, it completely fucks my settings. All of a sudden, I know,
3293000	3298520	I know everything about Miley Cyrus or a certain network. Oh yeah. NBC is like, like, like certain
3298520	3303960	networks will take over. Yeah. What they'll do is if you're installing a program by like Microsoft
3303960	3307640	or something, they'll change, even though it has nothing to do with your browser,
3307640	3312440	they'll change the default homepage on your website, which is such shit. I don't know how
3312440	3318760	they're allowed to do that. That pisses me off so much. And also, I think it feels, it's sad,
3318760	3324760	but it feels like inevitable that we, net neutrality, it's going to, it's going to go away.
3324760	3328440	And then we're not even going to remember it. And there's going to be different tiered service.
3328440	3333000	And I was talking, you guys mentioned this. I really think that it needs a sexier name,
3333000	3339320	the neutrality. That word inspires no passion. It should be like net freedom, or that's what,
3340360	3344840	Howard Cramer was saying, net freedom won't be a great anymore. Net equality. Net Braveheart.
3344840	3352040	Net Braveheart, a name we can get behind. Six internets in a movie, you know, like, like a slogan
3352040	3355160	we can get behind. Well, when I was a kid and the internet was just starting, and we called it the
3355160	3360040	World Wide Web back then, there was a thing called electronic freedom, but I think that sounded too
3360040	3365240	cyberpunk for, but I just sound too nerdy. Neutrality. I don't, I mean, it's obviously
3365240	3369880	something to hold on to, but it just doesn't, I think people see that word and they don't get
3369880	3374840	excited about it. No, I don't disagree. And there have been, you know, numerous discussions by people
3374840	3379240	much smarter, more powerful than I am, who want to change it. And it's like it, they just keep
3379240	3384600	defaulting back to it. Cause it's like, Oh, I guess it kind of feels neutral about it. Right. I know.
3384600	3391160	It's, it's, it's, it's not very important issue. Right. I feel like not that many people are engaged.
3392360	3396280	Adam Goldberg, we're here to think of a funny name or a better, more pungent name for
3396280	3402920	net neutrality. I'm shocked that we didn't, I wanted to congratulate him. I haven't heard a
3402920	3412200	peep out of him. We're talking about the internet and opinions and he, and I haven't heard a sound
3412200	3417960	from the Goldberg section. Did you talk about like Bigfoot last week? Maybe we've achieved,
3417960	3424760	we've achieved Goldberg neutrality. Maybe, maybe he brought a date. Maybe he's here on a date.
3424760	3427640	He's trying to impress her or him. Was he surrounded by dudes?
3428760	3435480	Maybe he's NFL quarterback, Adam Goldberg. I don't know. That guy's not in the NFL or a quarter.
3435480	3440280	I know. That's my own form of prejudice. I don't know anything about sports. They're all
3440280	3447160	quarterbacks to me and they're all gay. Now they're all gay. Along this, I really hate when
3447160	3451960	Ellen Page came out. She also came out a couple of days ago. Yeah. Yeah. Ellen Page came out and
3451960	3455880	so many people on Twitter were like, surprise, surprise. That's not the fucking point. No,
3455880	3460920	it's not. It's not the point. That's not the point. The, the, the openly part of openly gay
3460920	3466120	is the important point. Yeah. If, if gay was the important point, what do you do? You might as well
3466120	3471320	congratulate people on being straight. The openly gay is the important point because of the culture
3471320	3476440	of a. It's, it's important and historic that a guy in a notoriously homophobic environment,
3476440	3480280	like the NFL comes out and does that before he's even in, like going through the draft. Sure.
3480280	3483960	His career, his livelihood, the thing he's worked his, most of his life
3483960	3489240	toward is jeopardized by him saying that that's awesome. I don't know what's at stake for an
3489240	3493160	actress. I think it's going to be hard for her to get popped. I think it's going to get harder.
3493160	3498760	Yeah. I don't know. I hope it doesn't. I mean, I, I hope, I hope so too. I don't know what the
3498760	3502040	actual ramifications might be. Well, I also don't want to live in a world where she has to sit and
3502040	3507560	think about whether or not she's famous enough or high stakes enough to, to, to, to be, I don't
3507560	3512760	know. What I was going to say is what's insane is that it merits press conference status now. Like
3512760	3517800	it's crazy. Sure does. We have to come out and all the fucking flight floodlights have to be
3518520	3525160	everybody. I, I, I am, am, am, am gay, gay. And people like, like, it is a big crisis for
3525160	3529640	everybody. It's insanity. I said this on Twitter, but I feel like at some point we're going to live
3529640	3534120	in a world where just saying who you are, isn't like a brave political statement, you know?
3537320	3542920	We'll get there if people stop wearing hair pieces and stop having, having implants and stop
3542920	3547640	being ashamed of what they are. I flipped by her press conference. She was
3547640	3551560	talking about it. I'm like, and I'm not against her or against what she's doing. Like who gives a
3551560	3557080	shit? Like, why is this a fucking story? It's crazy. Like, but it's a story because it needs
3557080	3561560	to be a story so that it's not a story. I know. But like, I just, I'm just saying, like,
3561560	3566600	let's fucking grow up as a fucking country or world. Like fucking let's get past it. Holy fuck.
3566600	3570440	And that's why I love Johnny Ware for fucking dressing up like, like, like, like an absolute,
3570440	3574840	like, uh, but what also sucks is that he can do it in Russia, but nobody else can.
3574920	3579960	It'll be, it'll be funny the day. There's like some thresholds that we cross are don't feel
3579960	3584120	like thresholds, like the space program when it's like, okay, we've been exploring space so long.
3584120	3587720	We look like we're over in Apollo 13. There's that sad scene where they're like,
3587720	3592920	they're, they're not, they're not on TV right now. They think they're on TV, but they're not on TV
3592920	3597080	because you know why? Because we're so fucking good at exploring space that as, as a species,
3597080	3600760	we've succeeded. It's, I just hope we get a female, um, there will come a point where there will be
3600760	3608120	some actor, ladies and gentlemen, uh, daytime, uh, Emmy winner, uh, Kyle Flanagan. Uh, I'm gay.
3608760	3613480	And you hear, and you hear, you hear, you hear like one, one picture. It's like his mom.
3614520	3620440	And then I always knew you could do it. The, there it is. The non shot heard not around the world
3621000	3627960	for gayness. We are officially equal with gays. It doesn't matter anymore because it's important
3627960	3631800	is my point. Like, like, like, like, we shouldn't, we shouldn't bully people for being gay,
3631800	3636920	which probably we're not really allowed to because if Tom Cruise came out tomorrow,
3636920	3640280	like it would be a big fucking deal. That would be a big deal. And he hasn't yet.
3641080	3647400	And, and, and the fact that he hasn't yet is important. And, and, and so since he's not going
3647400	3654760	to yet, um, like if eight people underneath him that equal one Tom Cruise underneath him,
3654760	3660280	all come in, there's been so much denial for a lot of people through a lot of culture that like
3660280	3663800	now, like the guy that didn't say eight years ago, when he went into the first locker room with his,
3663800	3667640	with his NFL teammates, now that's weird to do it. Like at some point when you've just denied
3667640	3671960	it for your whole life, it's, it's, it's heroic. People go, look, guess what everybody, I was,
3671960	3676280	I'm coming clean. Like that, that's fucking awesome. I just wish that that would, like we're
3676280	3680440	saying that wasn't the top story. Then what, 10 years after that, after we achieved that
3680440	3684600	fucking high watermark of like, it doesn't matter if you're what, where you put your wiener,
3684600	3688520	there'll be a guy who's like, you know what, I don't know where I want to put my wiener.
3689320	3693960	Put a label on that, call it asexual, call it, call it, call it still figuring it out,
3693960	3699240	leave me alone. Like, you know, then that guy will be a hero. Uh, you know, they're all,
3699240	3703880	as long as there's a status quo, there's going to be people who are heroic for, for, for confronting
3703880	3707240	it until we get to the point where we're all actually just honest with each other until we're
3707240	3711240	not, we're not hiding things from each other because only then will we truly different from
3711240	3716920	the animals that we descended from. Uh, like, like we, we, we are, we are such political mammals.
3716920	3722440	Like we invented it. So like, like when we were like these squirrel creatures and we are shaking
3722440	3727800	that legacy, I feel like it's like we're, we're constantly in a battle with ourselves over
3727800	3733240	whether or not we're going to become insectoid or gods. Uh, and I don't know which is worse or which
3733240	3737320	is better. Uh, what turns us into great people with all the nines that are floating them through
3737320	3743480	the cosmos seeking other people's DNA so they can splash themselves with some genetic Campari,
3743480	3750120	you know, uh, it, it, it, I don't know, but I know that right now it's, it's not a great idea to lobby
3750120	3756520	for Borgness. I get bummed out when people are like offended by everything and like, let's, let's
3756520	3762920	all be perfect and rock Mary. But I also, I got a high five people who in the face of all of this
3762920	3767560	chaos, they rise up against the immediate things that make it difficult for them to, for me,
3767560	3771320	the big problem is like whenever I turn the TV on and I'm watching anything there's, there's
3773080	3776520	commercials for me and you know, now we get to fast forward to everything. Commercials are broken
3776520	3780600	up between like mostly for me, it's, uh, insurance commercials are a lot of insurance,
3780600	3786760	it's lots of insurance commercials, but then more and more it's like, I'm a truck guy. Oh yeah. You
3786760	3791240	know, truck guys. They're like, fucking stop it with the truck. If you call yourself a truck guy,
3791240	3795240	go fuck off. What do you, I don't know what that means. You, you turn to the culture of identifying
3795240	3802440	there's a genre of commercial right now. Truck guy. Okay. Well, that's what manhood they're trying
3802440	3808280	to cause it's sort of changing what being a man is, is changing the more, you know, sort of sensitive,
3808280	3814280	less like aggressive alpha men are sort of, you know, that's who we're seeing in movies and stuff
3814280	3820040	too. And so I think that's like a reaction to that. Like remember the good old days, you had a truck
3820040	3826120	and you'd fuck it every morning and that was, I think that's what it is. Look, it's my huge day.
3826120	3830760	It's got so much room for the first one year old. I will say it's codified like fuck, fuck. Oh, it
3830760	3835720	certainly is. It's certainly, I will say that's been going on forever. It's 2014 that's been going
3835720	3840360	on since the seventies. Like men have that. We do that the same way politicians do it to us.
3840360	3844200	Politicians convince us that there's a left and a right so that they can fuck around with us forever
3844200	3849480	because there's only rich and poor men say that there's such a thing as, as feminism. And there's
3849480	3854040	such a thing as masculinity so that we can constantly go back and forth between, uh, being
3854040	3858520	Alan Alda and then going like, fuck it. I'll fuck it though. It's a guy thing. We've been doing it
3858520	3862600	since the seventies. That's, that's as far back as I can go. I'm assuming we've been doing that
3862600	3867400	since 6,000 BC. I don't think we're ever good. Like, like, like, like that's, that's a fucking
3867400	3872280	dodge. Like that, that culture, like we have like these, these Belushi's that are like out there
3872280	3877080	going, like speaking for us and going like real men don't apologize. I'll fuck a quiche. I'm going
3877080	3883720	to come on Tim Allen's forehead or whatever. And then, and then we sit around and we go like,
3883720	3887720	oh, fuck those guys. I want to, I want to, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm metrosexual. I'm going to,
3887720	3892600	you last time to fuck a quiche. I last time to coming on Tim Allen's forehead. Yeah. I'm not
3892600	3897560	sure how that's masculine, but I assume that those guys like the, you know, I'll come on the
3897560	3903960	forehead. That's all we have left. I don't know. I got, I got, I got off on a tear. I just, I just,
3904120	3907880	I just didn't want to let men off the hook for a second because it was like, like the idea that
3907880	3917640	recently there's some kind of like big volcanic eruption of like masculine backlash. I think
3917640	3922120	it's a cyclical thing that we're returning to kind of a, kind of a caveman. He kind of like,
3922120	3928520	it's okay to have Dennis, uh, what's his name? Dennis, uh, like be the voiceover. Hey, look at
3928520	3933400	that. It, the turks on the truck, turk is what turns a turk. Let me break it down for it. It's
3933400	3937320	what makes the beer cap come off your bottle. Like, like, like, like, like, like, that's what
3937320	3942200	they're fucking selling a truck to. Oh, is that, is that how, is that what turk is? Like, like that
3942200	3946760	we're returning to that, the idea that let's get back to the good old days. When you say returning,
3946760	3950920	you imply movement. We all agree. There's no movement happening, right? There's stagnation.
3950920	3956200	That's it. There's, there's a two like projecting fucking images into our living room. Sure. But
3956200	3960280	we're changing. I think what it means to be a man, I think is different from, you know,
3960280	3964440	10 years ago. And I think we're sort of a step in the right direction to the extent that it's
3964440	3969720	not regulated by like either like corporations or the government. Like this internet thing happened
3969720	3974280	and we all kind of like, there's been this burst of like actual culture developing. Like we're kind
3974280	3979960	of like, I, I, I, I would say that bringing it back around to what the hell are we going to do
3979960	3983560	about this? Eddie Geller says, what are we going to do? We should go suck off this guy that works
3983560	3990680	at the FCC. Oh, thank you. Oh, that's not me. Sorry. I got that in my head. Um, well, I think
3990680	3996120	it's just like, you know, it's tough because I, it's not like we also have such short attention
3996120	4000040	spans. Like I was talking about this. Like remember a week ago, we all had strong opinions
4000040	4004680	on Woody Allen and now nobody's talking about it anymore. Right? No, and that's definitely true.
4004680	4008680	But it's also cyclical. Like, you know, net neutrality was a big thing. Like it first
4008680	4015880	popped up in 2006 and then you know, it does pop up again when, you know, the news finds it,
4015880	4021960	you know, interesting enough to cover. And I think, you know, just to be having this conversation,
4021960	4026440	you know, is worthwhile and that might sound like not enough. But for real though,
4026440	4029560	that's the important thing. What do you tell the 15 year old kid who's listening right now,
4029560	4034040	who shouldn't be by the way, but, but like he's listening, he's like, you know what,
4034040	4037960	I'm going to dip my toe into this big world and I'm going to start, I'm going to become a rebel.
4038040	4041960	I'm going to become an activist. Like, how can you tell this kid, like, like, what,
4041960	4046120	even what should he Google? What should he, what should he start reading about? Or is she, sorry.
4047320	4051960	Well, there's, I'm actually about to start working for an organization called Demand Progress,
4051960	4056600	which was started by Aaron Schwartz, the activist who about a year ago took his life. So that's,
4056600	4060280	that's a great organization that I'll shell for because they are about to hire me.
4061240	4065800	What was he an activist for? He was an activist for these same sorts of things. By the way,
4065800	4070600	it gives me, it makes me feel, it gives me no hope that the guy fighting for this was like,
4070600	4076280	fuck it, I'm going to kill myself. Well, he, it's kind of a complicated story, but he had,
4076280	4082360	that's terrifying. Well, he was actually, so he was charged with stealing these journalistic
4082360	4088600	articles. He was downloading from MIT. It's like, it's a very, it's a big can of worms, but he did
4088600	4093640	not, you know, to the best of my knowledge, you know, take his own life because of this fight.
4094440	4099000	But yeah, so there's, there are organizations, like if you, you know, if you're someone who's
4099000	4103000	like, yeah, fuck it, I'll click this petition. I'll sign it. Then yeah, you can find an organization
4103000	4106360	like Demand Progress. Do those really make a difference? So it's petitions that you sign
4106360	4110600	online. You know, they, they imbue these organizations that are working their ass off
4110600	4115560	with a little bit of credibility. Because if you're going to a congressman, you're going to the FCC
4115560	4120360	and you have, you know, a hundred thousand petitions, then you're at least bringing something
4120360	4123880	to the table. And that does mean something to them? Yeah, it does. It does. If you have them,
4123880	4128200	if you have enough of them on mass, it's a, it's a place to start. Even if it's not,
4128200	4133160	you're not going to sign something and, you know, uh, turn, you know, give us net neutrality
4133160	4137640	tomorrow, but you will be helping the people who are, you know, working to make this, you know,
4137640	4142200	make these things better. You're saying the least you can do is sign one of these online. I think
4142200	4145880	if you're, if you're, if you're listening and you're like, what's the least I can do, then yeah,
4145880	4149640	I, you know, when a petition comes across your Facebook page and you see it on Twitter,
4149640	4153720	you know, take the 30 seconds, fill it out and, you know, give these organizations.
4153720	4155800	Can we sign a hundred thousand cars and flip them over?
4159160	4164680	And I think to be angry, I think just to be, have some latent anger for when the, you know,
4164680	4170440	fat butt party comes along and you're like, yeah, these, I love these guys. I want to vote for them.
4170440	4175160	It was fun, but by the way, sorry, not anti fat, but I'm just saying,
4175720	4177560	Eddie Cal everybody. Thank you, Eddie. Thanks for coming.
4179960	4183320	Thanks, Eddie. Thank you, sir.
4185960	4187960	Let's bring Spencer up right now. Spencer crit.
4192600	4194280	All right, Jeff, you snapped it to action.
4197800	4200040	I don't have that clock over your shoulder anymore.
4201720	4204760	Yeah, I know. I just, I just looked at my phone and we started late too.
4205080	4207960	We got a bit of a late start. I got called up on stage.
4209240	4217720	Yeah. Remember when that happens, Spencer, is it true that you're about to be 25 years old
4217720	4228120	at midnight? Yeah. Yeah. That's very midnight. Spencer's birthday to you. Spencer's birthday to
4228680	4237320	us. It's also Dustin Marshall's birthday actually today. Come out here, Dustin.
4237880	4243960	Dustin, get out of here, you little devil. It's actually Dustin Marshall's birthday today.
4247720	4252840	Our podcast producers are extraordinary. Dustin podcast producer and podcast dungeon master. They
4252840	4258520	have consecutive birthdays. It's weird, man. Making for a veritable birth to Palooza.
4260440	4265560	A kind of burning birth. Can I mention how Anatoly's look is really coming along, huh?
4266440	4270920	He's really committing to something. He's like a Roy Orbison. Can I describe,
4271720	4276360	oh, I want to describe for people sitting beyond road two. Can you stand up and just sort of show?
4276840	4285800	Really? It looks great. He's got an old school Walkman, is that? Yeah. He's got an old school
4285800	4291400	Walkman. So you're like Don Cheadle in Boogie Nights. You're in search of an identity. He's got
4291400	4297000	big, big seventies glasses on, long seventies hair. He looks like he might possibly either be
4297000	4303640	crossed bestials or Nash. What's crazy is he hasn't even gotten to the mustache. Look at that
4304120	4307560	I mean, this might be cynical with me, but I feel like this whole Russian winter games
4307560	4311960	has gone to your head and I totally, you've gotten mad with Russian pride right now. You
4311960	4315400	feel like you can get away with anything. Yeah. You look like if like a little kid
4315400	4326280	in the seventies had to draw a grown up man. I think you guys are connecting the Russian dot
4326280	4331560	too much. He came out here to be a director. Remember we've been with Anatoly since his
4331560	4339400	birth as a character. He's like, I'm here to be a director. And we were like, do you watch TV? No,
4339400	4345080	do you? Nothing. He just wants to be a director. He's sidling into, this is what directing is as
4345080	4350440	far as I know. He's directing. He's directing himself first. You got to do, you got to look
4350440	4353960	like a director. But he's a director from the seventies for certain, right? Yeah. He's going
4353960	4359400	to work his way up to the present. No, no, in the seventies they were dressed like Roman togas and
4359400	4363320	stuff. They had to do whatever they could stick out. He's an Italian director from the sixties,
4363320	4369800	maybe, or at least George Landis, John Landis, John Landis, or George. I combined George Lucas
4369800	4375800	and John and to one super eighties director. One day we're all going to be working for Anatoly,
4375800	4386040	kind of Anatoly. What tape is in your Walkman? The kinks. Oh, the kinks. Well done. Yeah. See,
4386040	4391240	he's going to get by. It's that Schwab thing. He's going to get by and just fucking weird shit.
4393480	4398360	Meanwhile, I fucking slave over a keyboard. Fade in.
4401480	4408360	Fade in on what Anatoly? You don't know until I tell you, because I'm a writer.
4408360	4418680	You know what I dress like? Buck Henry. I dress like your dad, motherfucker,
4418680	4428440	because I'm proud of it. I'm an old bitch. Like your dad. You just call all their dads old bitches.
4429160	4433240	Look, if they're writers, I don't know. Whatever. My dad's an old bitch. Fucking writers,
4433240	4440040	unappreciated. Not bringing it back to that Hitler thing. Although in the green room,
4441800	4445560	I was just kidding. Like, it's just funny to me that I watched this movie that was kind of
4445560	4449720	made by George Clooney. It kind of gave me the misimpression that Hitler loved art.
4449720	4453480	Everyone loves art. Like, hey, I know that's not the impression he wanted to give. So I was just
4453480	4457400	making that joke, but I was kind of like, I like to step on the gas and go like, yeah, Hitler left
4457400	4461400	art. He's an artist. I'm like, Hitler wasn't a writer. And then somebody goes, um, Mein Kampf?
4463480	4473240	Sprechen sie Mein Kampf? He's arguably a more famous and worse writer than, uh, arguably more
4473240	4481960	famous than you. I didn't say than me. Then he was an artist. Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No,
4481960	4488200	his books only had more of an impact in his art. Yeah. Well, he's, he's the fact that the,
4488200	4496840	the writing he did, uh, we bring up more than the art he did. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, you really thought I
4496840	4506040	was going to, our killer is arguably a more famous writer than me. I'm going to be grudgingly giving
4506040	4514680	him that, but he wasn't that good. You ever read Mein Kampf? You should dateline Hollywood. All right.
4516600	4519480	Uh, how's it going, Spencer? Why did I get brought up here?
4520680	4524760	How's it going? What's, uh, have you had a fun week? I was just sitting somewhere else earlier.
4526760	4530600	Did you just say, why did I get brought up here? Yeah. It was kind of weird, right? Spencer's
4530600	4535960	murder complex. I don't, it drives me nuts. I just do. You guys tell me to, I brought him up
4535960	4543400	and then we didn't talk to him for aggressively. Okay. Fine. So it's cool. Just don't bring me up.
4543400	4549560	I'll watch from the back. We will not bring you up. All right. Problem solved. No taken. The guy,
4549560	4555160	the guy, he hates to be brought up. No, he, he wants to be brought up, but he wants to be addressed
4555160	4559240	like a human being when he's up here. We brought him up and we ignored him for 10 minutes. No,
4559240	4566520	we talked to him for a moment. Happy birthday for you motherfucker. And then you brought out
4566520	4575800	Justin. You brought out Dustin who got exquisite lighting. I think, I think it's his actual
4575800	4580600	birthday. And then you pivoted into the sanitary. I would say there's a totally dressed up like a
4580600	4587480	porn star. He looks like my dad. Yeah. Holy shit. Look at him. I'm not complaining about any of the
4588040	4593720	I'm totally complaining. You said don't bring me up. That's a complaint. That's an absolute complaint.
4593720	4598680	So that's an actual complaint. Don't bring me up and then do that. That's a complaint. You can talk
4598680	4604600	about Anatoly at length and then bring me up afterwards. Yeah. Not in that order.
4606360	4610440	That's amazing that I'm being told what I can't do. I'm not telling you what the name of the show
4610440	4616840	Spencer. Harmontown. I think it's two things. It's that Spencer is laid back and there's a
4616840	4622040	geography thing where he literally is in the shadows way off stage to the right. I work.
4622040	4627160	He's sitting down lower. Like even if he were sitting up on stage, he probably wouldn't insert
4627160	4631640	himself a lot, but he would be more included in the conversation because you're not like,
4631640	4636680	you're physically then not aimed at him. I think it's easy to not include somebody that's sitting
4636680	4640760	physically way off of the state. I don't need to be included. I just don't want to be brought up
4640760	4648760	and then explicitly excluded. Noted. Noted. Noted. We will avoid that in the future. There we go.
4648760	4653080	That is the first time on stage in Harmontown that there's been an adjustment to the structure of the
4653080	4659240	Harmontown show. We will no longer bring you up and then exclude you. That will not happen ever
4659240	4663880	again by your decree. Thank you. No, but we do that a lot though. We brought them up for like many
4663960	4669480	times. No, no, no. That's the first time we've gotten that adjustment. We do a lot of things
4669480	4674120	all the time. That's true. We just never get told what to do. But isn't he allowed to say that
4674120	4678200	if you're going to bring me up and maybe sit here alone for 12 minutes? Yes. Yes, he did. Do you
4678200	4683160	have any complaints you'd like to make? Would you like the show to be different in any way? Oh,
4683160	4692680	shit. Yeah. I'd like it to be funnier from the beginning. I'd like to get a standing ovation
4692680	4698280	after every show. I'd like it to be 15 minutes shorter all the time. Kale, are you happy with
4698280	4706200	the show? I think the show is great and perfect and needs no adjustments. What? No, I mean...
4707080	4709880	Well, you boo him now, but you won't when he's comptroller next week.
4712920	4719560	Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. And I'm pretty sure Adam Goldberg mentioned that he's a dungeon master,
4719560	4726440	didn't he? Oh, no. Nobody's on board for that. I don't know why I thought I'd be carried
4726440	4731560	and created this liberator. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. If we're going to start playing D&D,
4731560	4733640	let's bring out Erin McGathey. Erin McGathey.
4741400	4747960	Hi, Spencer. Listen, part of the show is that it's messy and that's part of the thing of it,
4747960	4754040	right? Right, Erin? Yes. Dan, speaking of messy, something happened in between you going on
4755400	4760600	this is crazy. This is no good. This is no good. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to try and
4760600	4763080	hype it up way too much. And then when you guys hear it, you're going to be like,
4763080	4770440	you didn't hype it up enough. This is no good. So for Dustin and Spencer's birthday,
4770680	4776040	I baked the audience a cake. That's the good news.
4778520	4783240	I baked the audience a cake and right before cutting the cake, I went back to the green room
4783240	4788920	and I washed my hands. And after washing my hands, I know, big deal. I washed my hands and
4788920	4792680	I looked at my finger and I remember thinking, Oh, I love my engagement ring. Such a great
4792680	4801320	engagement ring. Oh no. So then I went back and I cut the cake with other Erin, who's a great
4801320	4807640	intern here. We were cutting the cake and talking and then you went on stage so happy. And then I
4807640	4815080	looked at my ring and the diamond is missing from I told you I couldn't hype it up. So my diamond,
4815640	4821480	I hope no one ate it. And I was like, I was like, what does it look like? And then I was like, no,
4821480	4827560	I guess if I see a diamond on the floor, that's probably your diamond. It'll look like a piece of
4827560	4833960	chocolate cake probably. This is a good time to bring it up. That so-called diamond is actually
4833960	4839720	constructed of a very digestible substance. It's actually made of icing. It's called diamond
4839720	4850440	naffia. Birthday boy, Dustin Marshall said someone's gonna die. Or get rich. No, that's not
4850440	4858680	really, is that really dangerous? If you swallow a little tiny diamond. My older half sister,
4860120	4865560	one of her daughters, my niece, when she was a little baby, ate her diamond ring, her wedding ring.
4865560	4870680	And for two or three days, I had to watch or I didn't have to watch, but we had to hear reports
4870680	4877160	about my sister put diapers back on like the three-year-old or two-year-old that was off diapers.
4877160	4882920	Oh, to like sit through it. And then it took a big fork and a fork through her poop. So if everyone
4882920	4887320	could do that. Happy ending. She found it and is still wearing it to this day.
4887320	4897160	Are you still using that fork? You get rid of that. The fork actually was destroyed,
4897160	4901800	but it was framed and put up in the house. It's kind of us of that ring pass through her
4901800	4906600	daughter's body. It's like fucking great. Yeah, but now it's good. This diamond pass through one
4906600	4913800	of these guys body. I mean, I hope it's Anatoly. He does look like he ate a diamond. And he does
4913800	4922360	look like he would sift through his own shit. You dress that way for a reason. You did not want
4922360	4928280	attention. All right. But for real talk, real talk, the diamond is in one of you.
4930280	4934600	Real talk. Real talk is here. It's somewhere. The diamond is here. Lock the doors.
4936360	4940600	If you find it, I mean, if you really need it, if you find it, keep it. Fuck that. Well, no, no,
4940680	4946840	but the top dollar. I have sentimental attachments to it. I know you don't. You lost it in a piece
4946840	4951560	of cake. And before that, that's, that's the good news. We, we love each other. It's fine. Like,
4951560	4957000	I know my full, my full statement was if you need it, keep it. If you're, if you're a millionaire
4957000	4961480	and you don't need it, I'll make you something in exchange for it. I swear none of them are
4961480	4967480	millionaires. Also, if you feel guilty about it, it actually is a blood diamond.
4968040	4974040	Because it's a conflict diamond from stuff. Adam, you were so good until now.
4975880	4981160	I lost my wedding ring and I had to buy a new one. It was fine. The whole ring or just the
4983400	4986360	no, I didn't have a jewel on it. I'm new at this. I don't have mine yet.
4986360	4990280	Our love didn't suffer. Yeah. Aaron, all you have to do is ask. I'll shit you a diamond.
4990280	4994600	I know, I know. What do you want? That's the new, uh,
4994600	4998680	do you want marquee open fair shape? Pretty like square cut.
4998680	5001320	I didn't mean to cut you off, Aaron. So you were going to say the same thing I was, which is,
5001320	5006200	yeah, if you, if you, uh, if you are, if you are at a point in your life where you are willing to
5006200	5010520	go through your own poop, because you think you may be the recipient of a diamond. Well,
5010520	5014520	I don't think anybody was actually like, people chew cake. They don't swallow it whole. I think,
5014520	5018680	I think, but it's just, it's a, I mean, it's not, the bigger, the bigger concern is somebody
5018680	5023960	like absolutely shatters a tooth trying to chew it. Then that's, that's the, yeah, you definitely
5023960	5027960	get to keep the diamond. I would say that's probably a half eaten piece of cake somewhere
5027960	5031560	with a diamond sitting on top of it. I bet it's on the floor somewhere.
5031560	5035000	Yeah. Well, and clearly this is only reasonable, but obviously
5035000	5040920	we should not get married unless the same diamond is found. If it is not found,
5041480	5047480	also just murder on a kind of semi-related note. I lost a Gutenberg Bible backstage. If
5047480	5054920	anybody sees it, I had it inside of a, of a lemon muffin and, uh, it's really fine.
5054920	5059560	The people at Otterbox, if they make a wedding rings, like I'd like to get Aaron,
5059560	5063160	because that's where your phone, your phone case is from. Yeah.
5063160	5067480	Aaron could throw her phone across the room. Spencer, what do you think of all this?
5068200	5075480	I think it's great. You think it's great. Yeah. Spencer helped me, helped me look for it.
5075480	5078920	Yeah. I say we are speaking to sifting through shit. Let's play some D and D.
5081560	5086280	When I find the music, keep your applause going until I shouldn't have brought it up.
5086280	5093480	I shouldn't have said it until I hit this. Okay, cool. Sorry, Spencer. What? I didn't
5093480	5097400	show you up well, I'm sorry. You're, you're doing a great job, Jeff. Don't change a thing.
5097400	5104840	All right. Yeah, no notes. When we last met, our heroes were chained by the soul on trial
5104840	5110600	by skeletons in the city of Tormont Tor. After upsetting and confusing the bone sages,
5110600	5116760	second Tor appointed the party a special defendant, a novice lawyer by the name of skeleton Gary.
5117720	5121640	After a brief recess to catch up, Gary got down to business,
5121640	5127480	cross-examining, citing precedents and building a credible case. After a stirring and brilliant
5127480	5133080	oratory, skeleton Gary managed to acquit our heroes by promising that if freed, they'd bring
5133080	5139800	back the head of the marsh minotaur, scourge the flea market hills. But would our heroes be able
5139800	5145640	to fulfill their skeleton errand or would they be cast into the pits of Skaldor? Let's watch.
5146760	5158760	All right. So we just, we're freed from our soul chains, correct? Yeah. Yeah. That weird bug came
5158760	5169240	and died. Sure did. All right. So, uh, I, I pull, I mean, is, is our lawyer gone? I guess he is,
5169240	5175240	right? Yeah, he ran out. All right. I still owe him money. All right. I, uh, well, he's gone. So
5175240	5180920	fuck him. I turned to our group and say, look, we made some promises during that, uh,
5180920	5186520	that court hearing that we would go fight this marsh minotaur. It kind of sounded like improv
5186520	5193560	to me, but like we did kind of like bind ourselves to that promise. Uh, sounds like a bunch of
5193560	5197080	malarkey. I said, we just get the hell out of here and cut our losses. Yeah. Let's just get out of
5197080	5200760	here and be like, yeah, we'll do what you guys wanted us to do. And then we'll just sort of talk
5200760	5205400	when we're outside. Yeah. Yeah. Let's, let's, let's say whatever. Let's sign whatever we have
5205400	5210840	to sign and get the fuck out of here. Uh, there's, there's nothing to sign really. All right. Well,
5210840	5215640	thank you tour mod and tour. Uh, we appreciate your, uh, your, your bureaucracy and everything. And,
5216520	5220760	well, I guess we'll be on our way. I mean, you'll, you'll bring back the head of the marsh minotaur.
5220760	5225320	Yeah. Yeah, totally. Totally. Totally. Uh, do you, uh, you, you, you point us in a direction and
5225320	5231080	we'll, uh, we'll do whatever you like. Yeah. It's at the flea market Hills. Um, just be advised that
5231080	5238760	as part of this whole thing, you know, you're, you're obligated to do this under the penalty of,
5238760	5248760	uh, soul loss. Okay. We got it. I mean, what do you, what do you mean exactly? We're not attached
5248760	5254200	to the soul chains anymore. Like how does the soul loss thing, how could you like as a soul cop
5254200	5258920	gonna come and get us? I mean, no, it's just, it's in the magic of telemvarna. It's already
5258920	5264040	completed. Wait, what do you mean? Well, you saw the, you saw the beast of burden. Yes.
5264680	5271800	It made no sense to us. I mean, it's kind of the benchmark of our law, but that's fine. It's,
5271800	5278520	it's doesn't matter to you. What you're saying is if we default on getting the, uh, when it shrieks,
5278520	5283560	the binding arbitrations of telemvarna are inscribed onto your very soul. And if they are
5283560	5289960	not enacted properly, that'll, you know, kind of consume it. And if we don't bring back the
5289960	5295800	marsh minotaur's head, then we just go kaput. Like what happens if we lose our souls? I mean,
5296520	5301320	you stop existing pretty much. I mean, is there a time limit? How does it know the difference
5301320	5306680	between us taking a really long time to do it and not doing it? What if we just don't get to it?
5306680	5311160	Is there a shot? Is there a shot clock? You try that it's your soul. We can certainly try what?
5311160	5315080	To not, you know, to skirt telemvarna. I mean, if it takes us a hundred years,
5315080	5319400	is that cool? Or if it takes us five years, like how long is the shot? It's not up to me,
5319400	5324120	man. The magic's already there. Can we, can we, can we consult the magic and find out what the,
5324120	5335000	what the time limit is? Sure. Ask the magic. I, uh, I, uh, I cast magic eye roll and I ask the magic,
5335000	5342840	uh, you glean nothing. I mean, okay. Have you guys ever done this before? What's, what's the,
5342840	5346760	what's the, what's the normal statute of limitations on, on getting, on getting shit
5346760	5351400	done before your soul disappears. If you're not actively pursuing the quest,
5352040	5356680	you're going to start feeling it. I feel like we should have had this talk without him listening
5356680	5362040	to us. It's going to be, it'll be like, like, like back to the future. Not, I mean, I don't know what
5362040	5368680	that is. We'll look at our hand. All right, we'll go do it. All right. You know what? It'll be
5368680	5375480	Zemeckis's discretion. Are there any weaknesses to this Marsh Minotaur that we should know of?
5375480	5382200	Oh, I'm sure he's not full of great strengths. You're probably fine. Oh, so all right. So let us
5382200	5386360	tell us which direction we start walking to the flea market Hills. Oh, I'll do you one better.
5386360	5393080	Linnev, you, you show them. Oh, fuck. Oh, we gotta go with this. God damn it. Okay. I pull
5393080	5399240	Sharpie aside and say Sharpie. No. What? We're going to have to do this with Linnev and there's
5399240	5405320	two ways to do this. The easy way or your way. Are we going to get along or are we going to fight
5405320	5412840	the whole way through? I would like to go on a vision quest by myself. All right. Can we get
5412840	5419240	anyone but Linnev? Why does it have to be Linnev? He's, he's the Marshall around these parts.
5419880	5427640	I've been to the flea market Hills. Yeah. In fact, I know the Minotaur. Yeah. We don't need Linnev.
5427640	5434520	We've got, we've got this one over here. All right. Well, everybody leave. We're going to do private
5434520	5441800	stuff in here. Sharpie, I used to go on a vision quest. Yeah. He's doing the private stuff.
5442440	5447880	Is Linnev, is Linnev coming with us? I guess, I guess not. Is Linnev, are you coming with us or no?
5447880	5455800	Fuck you. I'll show you guys the way. I, I, I used to go out with the Minotaur. All right. Sounds good.
5456840	5461800	I'll come with you guys. I kind of wanted to hear about your vision quest after you were done. Well,
5461800	5468280	I mean, the good news is you're now on it because she doesn't know where to fuck the Minotaur.
5469240	5475880	Thank you. We had a roommate lead the way this way. I go in the right direction.
5479080	5485240	Um, you search for the right direction and you see some Hills. They're probably the only Hills
5485240	5491720	in the area. They, uh, we, when I used to travel in these Hills before we used to call them the
5491720	5500120	little eggs. Come on, gentlemen. This way, little eggs. Yeah. They look like big eggs. If anything,
5500120	5506440	it made no sense when we said it, but we called them the little eggs. Tell us about that. You
5506440	5510840	said you met the March Minotaur. Tell us, tell us all about him. Tell us all about him. What's
5510840	5530760	his favorite color? Flashback. Oh, you're early. A Minotaur is never early nor is he late. He arrives
5530760	5545320	precisely when he needs to. His name is Marsh. She thinks my name is Marsh. Marsh. Yeah. She
5545320	5550680	thinks my last name is Minotaur. That's like having someone named Edward human.
5550680	5566440	Um, Marsh, I, I, I made you, I made you this little bucket. What is the bucket for?
5567720	5574920	I put good wishes in it for, for a date. I routinely, uh, the Sedona family, we give everyone
5574920	5580200	buckets and this is, this is, I mean, now I feel embarrassed, but here's this bucket.
5581080	5587880	Where are we going on the date? Thanks for this bucket. Can I leave it here and pick it up later?
5587880	5595560	Yes, yes, of course. Yes, yes. We're going to the, uh, we're going to the, um, uh, the flea market
5595560	5600680	Hills. Oh, excellent. I've never been there before. Real quick. Pause. We hit, we flash back to the
5600760	5603560	present while we watch you. What kind of look up in the air while you're going,
5603560	5606440	while you, you're clearly going into a flashback and I look every go,
5606440	5610040	this is going to be an awesome flashback. I can't, I can't wait to hear what happens on this one
5611400	5618760	back into the flashback. Yeah, I guess we could go there. Yeah. Um, hey, I don't want to be weird,
5618760	5623720	but I heard that, uh, you had a bad experience in the flea market Hills. Last time you
5624360	5632840	visited them, you were part of a story that I read in this. Do I tell the story?
5633560	5635880	I do the heavy lifting in this improv.
5639480	5645800	I heard, I heard that, uh, someone was selling something, uh, that you found very offensive and
5645800	5652600	you charged several, uh, halflings and you, you ended up, you, you contributed to the deaths of,
5652600	5658280	of many halfling children. I was misunderstood. They had a confederate flag with swastikas on it
5660360	5663880	and I was like, that's wrong. And they were like different symbols mean different things to different
5663880	5672760	people. And, uh, I just sort of, uh, went nuts and some lives were lost, but I don't think there
5672760	5678440	were lives worth saving anyway. They were like, you know, yeah, I mean, obviously I'm on the
5678440	5683400	state, so I'm on your side. I just wanted to clear that up. Yep. So that's it. But I think
5683400	5688920	it's blown over. I don't think people think of me as like a bad guy anymore. There's no like
5688920	5694840	counsel trying to like kill me or anything. I feel like, I feel like I've explained myself.
5694840	5700680	Oh, the buttons on your, on your pants are like coming apart. Here's that.
5701480	5709320	Yep, they are. Aren't you curious how far down the hoarseness goes?
5711640	5712920	Oh, that's a center.
5714920	5717960	Bullness. That's a center.
5719240	5721080	Dan, I'm referencing our first date.
5726520	5727720	What happened? He left.
5727720	5731320	It's just a guy that has to take a shit. That's not, it happens every day.
5732600	5740440	I didn't mean that as sexually as it came across, but, uh, so great. Let's just stay here then,
5741240	5745240	meaning that we won't actually go to the flea market, but we've had a connection.
5745240	5752440	Yeah. Flashback of it. So you know the, you know the minute time. Yeah. So tell me all about them.
5752440	5759640	Well, I, I just relived that a flashback out loud. Um,
5759640	5763000	what happened with the Minotaur? Did you guys stay home? Yeah.
5765000	5770120	You know what I mean? We started, we started the, I mean, things got. How far down did his hoarseness go?
5772680	5778840	Bullness. It went down as far as you think. I mean, things go, you know, people have chemistry with
5778840	5784680	certain people. Things started to get hot and heavy and it was clear that things weren't meant
5784680	5791400	to be for us. That's all. And then I, um, I put on work in Mindy and we watched that.
5794200	5802520	And then he, I don't, I, I, I'm let's go to the, let's go back to the flashback. This never happens
5802600	5810280	to me. No, it's fine. It's fine. I think I ate something bad for breakfast.
5811400	5814840	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5814840	5819720	It's just as Mark and Mindy saw in the background. Oh, it's loud. It's a loud and assertive. No, no,
5823960	5825400	no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
5825400	5835880	The episode where he took over Europe and hoarded all the art. No, no, no, no, no, no,
5835880	5843160	no, no, no, no, no. Burt the Picassos. Your by. Oh, um, I'm, you know what? There's never,
5843160	5848440	you know what? I'm going to go. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'll call you though. I swear,
5848440	5852840	and you know what? I'll pick up the bucket when I come back. Well, can I give you this Reese?
5853480	5861560	I want to, I'm going to tie it around your neck. I have an idea. How about I pick up the
5861560	5865800	wreath when I come back for the bucket? Please just take this. All right. I'll take the wreath.
5865800	5871720	I'll take the wreath. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. All right. I'll call you.
5871720	5885320	All right. Well, so you, so, so suffice to say you have a long standing relationship with this.
5885320	5890280	Yes. I mean, I never, I never saw him again. He's a nice guy. He's misunderstood. I, I,
5890280	5895320	I would like to face him. He doesn't sound very tough. Like he doesn't sound like a real threat.
5895320	5898360	Like he sounds like he's kind of a regular, like it's not just kind of,
5898440	5901640	he sounds like you never know where he's coming from to hear you say it.
5903000	5908760	Yeah. I, I suppose that's true, but also like if he was on Lulu, what's that app? His hashtag,
5908760	5918040	his hashtag would be like all over the two horns, no ambition. I don't know. What do you
5918040	5928200	horn's not three. All right. Well, so where is he? He's up. He's up through these. He's up in the
5928200	5934440	middle. Yeah. Let's go this way. Let's go there. We start going there. Okay. Okay. You sure we,
5934440	5941480	we shouldn't stop through a digression Valley for a while. Oh yeah. It's right off exposition lane.
5942200	5949080	All right. We head toward the, we tend towards small egg Hills, little eggs, little eggs. Yeah.
5949080	5955480	You go, you go to that place. You see Hills. You also see a lot of, a lot of stalls and booths,
5955480	5962680	like some sort of farmer's market or maybe a flea market has been set up. It looks largely abandoned
5962680	5967880	though. That's what you see. Do you want to call out for him?
5967880	5981240	Hey, Marsh, not to be weird, but I guess I'm, I happen to be here. It's not for you. I'm here
5981240	5990280	with my boyfriend. I widdle. I widdle. You see, you see shifting wood. There's like some sort of
5990280	5996280	wreckage of wood and you see a small skeletal figure crawl out of this woodwork holding a
5996280	6005880	little sign. The sign says, don't be cheesy. Is that don't? Don't like don't with a J.
6008840	6016920	Like, like Django. Yeah. Yeah. Like that. But don't. Hey, hey, little, little one. Bye my cheeses.
6016920	6030520	No. Okay. And I like cheese. I just don't like your sign. I keep widdling. Have you,
6030520	6035160	have you seen, you know, have you seen a minotaur walking around who's kind of, you know,
6035160	6043560	emotionally unavailable, but clearly handsome and people are very taken by him, but, but maybe he
6043560	6049080	doesn't have that high enough self-esteem to accept love yet. I sure did. He came in and
6049080	6054600	stopped all my cheeses. I should have clarified earlier. It's stopped cheese. He's what he's
6054600	6059720	slapped all your cheese. He stopped them all. Stomped all the cheeses. Just like him.
6062280	6071080	I think you're still kind of sweet on this guy. I mean, who knows. You know, sometimes people
6071160	6075800	come together at different times in their lives, but you know, I agree. Sometimes just the time
6075800	6079720	isn't right. You know, even if the people are right for each other. Wait, how are you tied up
6079720	6088040	in this? I just, I sort of, uh, I, uh, I understand what you're saying. That's happened to me. Do you
6088040	6099400	two have a previous lover? I have pull a Christmas. Flashback. Hey, hey, you want more of that?
6099400	6101560	Every day.
6104920	6111160	Sorry, let me turn down the TV. You know what? Just turn it off. All right. With pleasure.
6112440	6121400	So it's two for six, six for two, 12 for 20. And I like your style.
6122360	6129000	The flashback. You guys sounded like you're really in love. Yeah, I got the 12 for 20.
6134360	6141720	Flashback. I'm going to warn you at the 12 for 20. Why? The government requires me to tell you
6141720	6145720	you'll never be the same. Flash forward to the present.
6145720	6157000	That was the last mistake I ever made. It kind of sounds like you were, you, you met
6157000	6162840	Dolph Lundgren. Yeah. I mean, I'll tell you that 12 for 20 was totally worth it,
6163720	6169560	but I never have been able to write a song since then. Oh, did you write woman in red,
6169560	6175400	lady in red before that meeting? I wrote, I wrote woman in red. He wrote, I wrote lady in red right
6175400	6180760	before that meeting. And I was like, Oh, I'm a songster. Oh my God. And I was like, nothing will
6180760	6188280	take this away from me. So that guy, he literally fucked you out of a career. But you know what? I
6188280	6193480	wouldn't have it any other way. I go examine the footprints and the cheese that's been stopped.
6193480	6198920	It's all stomped. Did they lead in a direction? They do. They lead over the hill, believe it or
6198920	6210120	not. This way, gentlemen, let's go over the big yolk. Yeah. I guess you guys are doing that. Yeah.
6210120	6215960	Yeah. Yeah. We're going to get the marshy. Yeah. You go over the hill and you see at the bottom of
6215960	6222760	the hill, just, just lying right there in sight, a dank smelly cave. You could smell it from here.
6223720	6231560	Let's go in there. Yeah. I don't want to wall it up with rocks. Well, so that no one can ever
6231560	6240440	get in or out. But maybe we should see what's happening. I take two of my arrows and I put my
6240440	6244680	hair up in a bun and I do that like a thing that middle schoolers do when they put two pencils in
6244680	6249880	their hair, but with my arrows. Oh yeah. Like with knitting needles. Yeah. People do them. I'm just
6249880	6254840	going to go in really quick and, and just, just see what's going on. No, no one, you're going in
6254840	6260440	with us because first of all, this minotaur is ferocious. Second of all, you can't control
6260440	6264280	yourself around him. You have a history with him and you don't know what you're doing. Right. You
6264280	6268600	have a codependent relationship. Well, I appreciate you guys coming in with me. Um, if I make any
6268600	6273400	jokes, please laugh loudly. And also if it comes up organically, please call me pretty and smart.
6273480	6280040	Let's do it. Hey, before we go in there, resolve this. You, you, you,
6283400	6288840	you should be the one staying outside this cave. You're, you can't control yourself. A lot, a lot
6288840	6293240	has happened to me since the last time that I saw him and I've evolved a lot and I've changed a lot
6293240	6301400	and I realize that I'm exposing myself for being an insecure archer. Um, I, uh, but I, I just, I just
6301400	6305960	want him to see how great I am now and I want him to see the company I keep because more than
6305960	6315800	anything, I'm proud of the company I keep. I use, I use sense motive if I can. Uh, oh, I want to know
6315800	6322840	like, can I answer this one? No, you have to do it truthfully. Okay. Yeah. So what's going on?
6322920	6335000	What's really going on? Is it a different voice or is it? Yes. Um, I, uh, I, I love you.
6335880	6343320	I don't love him, but I want him to think I'm hot. So relatable. I get it. We've been,
6343320	6346920	we've all been through relationships where we feel like they took our wallet. We want our wallet
6346920	6352520	back in a way. It seems like she wants to show you off to him and say, look how great my life
6352520	6357560	is. I get it. I'm going to be that guy for you. Let's do this. By the way, I guess, I guess I'm
6357560	6361960	your boyfriend. I didn't even know that. Oh, you guys need a little bit of room. Should we?
6361960	6370200	No, not at all. I'm asexual, but I'm a wizard. All right. I, I take my sword out and I, I look at
6370200	6375240	you guys. We all stand like for a breast and like, we're all standing at the entrance to this cave
6375960	6380920	and like, I'm ready to go in there with you guys. All right. Let's go in. I'm super excited. What
6380920	6384920	kind of, what kind of pose do you take? Are you saying that we all hold our weapons up and then
6384920	6393000	the sun like is behind the weapons and that kind of like what's the lens flare comes out and it
6393000	6398600	says to be continued in the lens flare. But there is a voiceover that like, kind of like
6398600	6403720	dukes of hazard that says, Ooh, like, like what's about to happen? Kind of a teaser. I think you
6403880	6413800	do more. We started the show late. Hey, if it were up to me, we would be here until three in the
6413800	6420600	morning. Okay. We put our weapons together and I just charge into the cage. Charge! Charge!
6420600	6427160	Yelling. I kick anything in my way. Kick, kick. No, no, no. Going. No, no, no, no, no. Kick, kick, kick.
6427160	6431400	I run as fast as I can to get ahead of them. So he doesn't need quirk first.
6432360	6437000	Charge back! Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick. Also, I have a partial boner and my pants
6437000	6442840	are halfway down. I swear to God, if you rate my expectations. I'm trying my hardest.
6444280	6450120	These flashbacks really turned me on. I'm not saying. Don't blame you. All right. So you're
6450120	6455560	stomping, stomping into this cave. You could have ended the show. There's bones and skulls all over
6455560	6460120	the place adorning the floor. And as you charge in all loudly and yelling and kicking and doing
6460120	6467800	those things, you hear, you hear a weird wailing. It calls, it calls out. It's like, stay back.
6470520	6472600	Guys, I think Peter Sellers is in prison here.
6475800	6479880	All right, guys, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll check it out. Yeah, yeah. Yell out to him.
6481880	6489480	Marsh. I was destroying. I've been called down in a long time. No, okay. This is a joke we used
6489480	6498040	to have where he would say, I'll destroy you. I smooth my hair back with my, with my hand and I,
6498040	6505960	and I, I approach. Hey, bananas, right? It's a joke. It was a joke. We had a thing. You guys
6505960	6512280	had a joke called bananas, right? We had a, we, there was this time where we were walking down
6512280	6517320	the street and there was a banana tree and a bunch of bananas fell all at once. You know what?
6517320	6523880	It sounds cool. What are the walls made of, Spencer? Like cave stuff. Okay. I start climbing
6523880	6527400	the walls and try to get like into like, like, like up along the side of the walls. It's like,
6527400	6531800	while she's distracting him, I try to get like into a flanking maneuver. That's your solution to
6531800	6539640	everything. Kill it then fuck it. It starts climbing the walls. If it, if it broke. Yeah.
6539640	6544440	The walls are slick with some sort of weird moisture. That's, that's my fault.
6545080	6547960	But, uh, it's all the description of skulls.
6549720	6555800	You still managed to climb up into the, the cave. You're, you're holding on to a slack type.
6555800	6562280	And I just, I'm just crawling along slowly. Very slowly. Yeah. I look back like, like, I feel like,
6566120	6573000	keep them on the phone call. I bound, I bound down, like kicking high.
6574440	6580600	Kicking massive amounts of dirt, smashing everything I can, waving my hands in the air,
6580600	6589640	and yelling, great googly boogly! I'm in your cave! Um, you, you do that. Um,
6591160	6595320	I don't know if you're making the kind of boyfriend impression that she wanted you to make.
6595320	6601320	Well, I'm angry because, like, marry him. Because why? Oh, come on. Let me break. How
6601400	6605080	would you react? You said five moments ago you don't remember that we were dating.
6607400	6615080	All right. I, I run, I run towards, I run towards the, uh, towards the voice. I kick every stalagmite
6615080	6620200	and stalactite. Except the one that he's on? Well, whatever one he's on, fine. I throw rocks
6620200	6629960	behind me as to try to home alone, uh, Sharpie's Path. Uh, do you home alone it? Great. What am
6629960	6636280	I doing? I don't know. What are you doing? I'm, like, super weirded out by everyone. I yell,
6636280	6644120	I am not on board! Okay, so how close am I to the, uh, to, to wherever this voice is coming from? Not
6644120	6648840	very. I mean, you're crawling on a ceiling. He's all running. I feel like we should just go talk to
6648840	6651960	him. We don't need to go on ceilings and kick stuff, right? We just go talk to him. But I'm
6651960	6656840	trying to dare. Because what we want to do, we have to kill this guy. Let's face it. Right. We
6656840	6660920	have to chop his head off. Bring him to us. I don't want to come looking for him. Where are you?
6663800	6669320	Do I see him yet? I'm running and I'm running and I'm running. You keep running and you see a light
6669320	6675720	around the bend like there's lit stuff around the bend. I keep on running towards that light. I see,
6675720	6681320	you see the marsh minotaur. It's seated. It's sitting, kind of sprawled out. You see its
6681320	6688040	udder just kind of laying all over the floor. It passed with the udder? The reality of my past
6688040	6694840	lover. He's a cow? And it's, uh, it's looking at a weird... Yeah, udder's girls have udder's.
6694840	6699480	Boys, boy, boy minotaurs. That's crazy. That's crazy. This thing's got an udder.
6701000	6707480	Okay. Yeah, you don't even see it, man. Also, maybe he identifies as a male. He's not
6708440	6716040	biological. I run, I run towards, uh, I run towards him. Marsh! What? You're not skeletons.
6716920	6722200	No, it's, uh... I thought you guys were skeletons. Hey! Deep down, we're, we're, we're, we're...
6722200	6729160	You're not there. Oh, okay. Sorry. It's, it's me. Are you okay? What?
6730440	6735800	Do you, do you remember me, Maureen Sedana? What are you talking about? I'm talking about memories.
6738040	6743000	Then no. Dude, you, you remember me. We met in that elevator. I dropped all my papers and you
6743000	6751000	picked them up. What's an elevator? Dude, did you hook up with a different minotaur? That's racist.
6753720	6760440	I, I, I examine his face and I, and I see that he is clearly a different...
6760440	6763640	But you let us here.
6767160	6771240	Hey, do you know another minotaur who really likes smork and mindy?
6772120	6779320	What's smork and mindy? Okay. Um, you seem suicidal.
6780520	6783480	I mean, I wouldn't go that far. What are you doing in my cave?
6783480	6793880	I, I draw my longsword and I say, uh, ending this.
6796520	6800600	And then I, I take it down on them. We wanted his head, right?
6801880	6806440	I'm on a ceiling back in the hall. I've been reminded that I'm not there.
6806440	6810440	Yeah, none of us are there. It was just you. I hit all kinds of awesome funny stuff to say.
6810600	6814600	I look, I look around his neck and I say that there's no wreath.
6815480	6818840	And clearly the guy, the minotaur I dated would always wear this wreath.
6819560	6824280	Even if he felt nothing for me, because that's how Maureen Sedana deals with the world.
6824280	6830680	I take the sword and I, and I, I put it down on the minotaur's neck with great force.
6834120	6840280	You bring down the sword upon its neck and it, it just hits its neck and it just breaks your blade.
6841160	6841660	And I-
6842520	6845080	Right as, uh, Sharpie and Krista Berg arrive.
6845080	6846920	Hey, what's up?
6847800	6850040	Did you do any, you didn't do anything stupid, did you?
6853000	6854760	How can I support your relationship?
6857640	6861000	As a good person. I have a box of wine.
6863000	6869400	Hey guys, that sword I bought at the magic shop really works. It breaks when you want it to.
6870120	6871800	Why would you attack your ex-boyfriend?
6875960	6879640	Have I crawled on the ceiling enough to be in the same room? Am I still out in the hallway?
6879640	6881800	I mean, if you were walking, you would have.
6890920	6892600	I don't care if it takes me 10 episodes.
6893240	6898440	I've, I've, I've, I've made my bed. I'm going to lie on it. I'm going to fucking,
6899160	6900600	how far outside of this room am I?
6901960	6903080	Like a couple rounds.
6903080	6903560	Okay.
6903560	6904600	You're getting there.
6904600	6910120	The marsh minotaur rises to its, its feet and it's like, why are all these humans down here?
6910120	6913720	And why are you attacking me? Aren't there skeletons you could go bother?
6915560	6917800	You are right.
6917800	6920600	Excuse me. Marsh, is it Marsh?
6920600	6921560	No, it's Kaddith.
6922120	6922680	Kaidith?
6922680	6923560	Yup.
6923560	6924840	Definitely a different guy.
6926360	6926680	Guy?
6927320	6928520	Minotaur. Sorry.
6928520	6934760	I'm sure it be butts a lot. Uh, my, my, uh, my friends and I have gotten mixed up in a lot of
6934760	6941880	bullshit with a lot of parasites, a lot of bureaucrats over this, uh, campaign, uh,
6942520	6945080	whatever you'd call that in our world.
6945080	6946040	I've been there.
6946040	6951240	Yeah. Uh, we were on trial with the, uh, skeletons.
6951240	6951800	You know them?
6953480	6954200	Yes.
6954200	6957880	Our lawyer, our lawyer got us off by promising that we'd kill you.
6959240	6960200	I don't want to do it.
6960200	6961560	I see no profit in it.
6962280	6964360	Frankly, I don't see how we do it.
6964360	6967400	You're a big strapping, very straight guy.
6967400	6967720	What?
6968680	6969800	You're so straight.
6969800	6971000	Do you know how udders work?
6972040	6973880	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
6973880	6976200	A very strapping, uh, entity.
6977160	6983720	Uh, of any, of nothing. I didn't mean to imply gender at all.
6983720	6984360	All right.
6984360	6984920	Okay.
6984920	6985400	Shit.
6987400	6989560	This is definitely not your Minotaur.
6990200	6992440	We, we, we briefly cut back and made the ceiling.
6993400	6994840	Goddamn, you son of a bitch.
6995400	6999960	The truth of the matter is that we got, we got time bombs implanted on our souls by these
6999960	7007800	skeletons. Uh, if we don't fulfill our goal, uh, we, our, you know, our souls blow up or
7007800	7010440	something. I got no beef with you.
7010440	7013560	I got more beef with people that would do that kind of thing to people.
7013560	7015080	Yeah. Skeletons are dicks.
7015080	7016360	They're total dicks.
7016360	7019160	There's a skeleton guy comes in and milks me.
7020840	7022120	Are you fucking kidding me?
7022120	7022520	What?
7022520	7023480	His name's Jont.
7023480	7028920	Jont, be cheesy.
7029880	7034840	If you're more native to this bureaucracy than we are, if we can figure out a way to like,
7034840	7036840	you know, turn this whole thing on its head.
7036840	7039400	I just fell down here one day through a marsh.
7040360	7042280	That's metaphorically what happened to us.
7043000	7043320	Whoa.
7045160	7047000	Sounds like we have a common enemy.
7048040	7051000	Finally, finally, we find it. We meet a nice person.
7051000	7053480	I like this guy.
7054200	7057240	I like, oh, I like this person.
7057240	7058600	I like this person.
7059240	7063160	I also like this person. I give, I give a chaos.
7063160	7063400	Yeah.
7064360	7065560	Will you accept this bucket?
7068680	7073400	I guess I will as a symbol of me casting off my oppression.
7074120	7076680	It's kind of, it's, it's like a rapper wearing, yeah.
7078200	7079960	What? Oh, chains?
7079960	7080520	Yeah, well.
7081320	7082280	Whoa.
7082280	7084360	No, I mean, it's profound. Yeah, it's profound.
7085320	7086840	I didn't, I didn't come up with it.
7088840	7089720	Am I in the room yet?
7089720	7090360	It's an interesting video.
7090360	7091320	No, dude.
7091320	7092280	Yeah, yeah.
7092280	7095880	Okay, I, I, I, I emerge in this on the ceiling of the room.
7096920	7098840	Talk to me after the show if you want to talk about that.
7098840	7101320	And these rappers were changed because they're reminiscent of the chains of slavery?
7101320	7102920	No, not, not consciously.
7102920	7104440	Okay, okay.
7104440	7108680	Oh, it's part of their unconscious, uh, ancestral memory.
7109160	7112280	That they have inherited from their brethren.
7112280	7115080	I looked down and I go, hey guys, is that the Marsh Minotaur?
7115080	7115320	Yep.
7116520	7118520	Oh, Jesus, I'm not, I'm not.
7118520	7119640	I'm on the ceiling.
7119640	7121720	Oh, hey, spider pal.
7121720	7122600	You made it.
7122600	7125400	I, I'm startled and I take my knife and I throw it at his back.
7126600	7127400	Who is that?
7127960	7130600	I, I, I, I, I declared it was me.
7131320	7132280	You hit, yeah.
7133640	7134840	You take six damage.
7135400	7141880	Shit, I store that memory and bury it deep, deep inside.
7141880	7142840	Is he still up there?
7142840	7147560	I, I, I, I, I start shimmying down the side to get down there and I go, look,
7147560	7148600	is everything cool today?
7148600	7151080	I, I, I thought I was doing the right thing by getting up here and like,
7151080	7154520	like being like sneaky, but apparently we didn't have to be sneaky about this.
7154520	7155080	Kharev.
7155080	7156120	Was that your name?
7156120	7156920	Khayev.
7156920	7157400	Khayev.
7158120	7159160	Khay-dev?
7159160	7159480	Khay-dev.
7159480	7160760	Like high def, but with a K?
7161640	7162600	What's high def?
7162600	7163000	Okay.
7163000	7163800	Khay-dev it is.
7164600	7165880	Khay, Khay-dev?
7165880	7166360	Khay-dev.
7167480	7169880	Listen, let's form a human minotaur pact.
7171000	7171320	Okay.
7174440	7175400	But I'm telling you,
7177080	7178040	we're kind of bound.
7178040	7181800	Like we, we got like a cosigned auto loan here on our souls.
7181800	7184840	Like I've been honest about that with you.
7184840	7186120	Yeah, that sucks, man.
7186680	7187880	I'll try and help you out.
7187880	7189560	I guess I don't know how that works.
7189560	7192200	Let's go attack the, because I feel like skeletons have been
7192680	7194680	dicks to us from the very beginning.
7194680	7195320	I agree.
7195320	7197240	You've been awesome to us.
7197240	7197800	So great.
7197800	7198440	Thanks.
7198440	7198840	Thanks.
7200040	7203160	Thanks for thinking my knife on your neck joke was funny.
7204680	7205000	Whoa.
7206120	7207080	Yeah, what was that?
7209560	7210760	Okay, be very careful.
7211400	7213320	That's how humans say they love you.
7213320	7216280	Yeah, it's like blood brothers, but more intense and one-sided.
7216280	7219720	See, she like quarks so much, she threw a knife at him.
7219720	7221320	Yeah, we do that sometimes.
7221640	7225240	I take her knife and I just kind of put it in the back of my pants
7225240	7228440	and just kind of stare like kind of creepily like a fucking...
7228440	7229800	I have a bad pitch.
7229800	7230840	Bad pitch.
7230840	7231480	Room number.
7234600	7237320	We keep writing back to the skeletons and saying,
7237880	7239320	we're still looking for him.
7239320	7240920	I think we're right behind him.
7240920	7241320	Great.
7241320	7243240	And we just keep that going forever.
7243240	7244200	I think that's a great idea.
7244200	7246360	But we adopt him as a member of our party.
7247160	7249800	And so we're always kind of like one step behind him
7249800	7250920	because he's in front of us.
7251800	7255480	And then hopefully that'll thwart whatever soul magic
7255480	7261000	is enforcing this dumb magic pack thing on us.
7261640	7263080	Okay, just to try it.
7263080	7266040	If we start to get nauseous or he falls out,
7267000	7268280	we kill the minotaur.
7270280	7273800	Because he's not a real minotaur, he is utters.
7275640	7277160	Don't look behind you as Spencer's rolling dice
7277160	7277800	while you're talking.
7277880	7281400	But overall, we're a happy family.
7282760	7285320	It's not losing our lives.
7285320	7286840	It's gaining a party member.
7288760	7290920	Weren't you saying that not to him?
7290920	7292040	Weren't you saying that like...
7292040	7292920	Yes, saying it to us.
7293880	7296360	Yeah, but you're looking at me like the minotaur heard that.
7296360	7298440	No, I'm turning to look at you like Spencer.
7298440	7299320	I'm going.
7299320	7300920	And so it's Karev.
7301640	7302440	Kai-deaf.
7302440	7303160	Kai-deaf?
7303160	7303960	Karev.
7303960	7304840	Most deaf?
7304840	7309800	We would like to welcome you into our happy family.
7309800	7310520	Awesome, man.
7313800	7315560	Cliff Hanger?
7315560	7316360	Crushing Mark?
7320360	7320840	We did it.
7320840	7322520	Thank you, everybody, for coming to Harman Town.
7323640	7326760	I mean, we ended on kind of a peaceful resolution there.
7328440	7330520	You find that diamond, you may keep it,
7330520	7332120	or tell me that you have it.
7333480	7334360	There's a diamond here.
7334920	7337640	Sangeeti Geller, Knell, Kamil Nanjiani, Aaron McGathey.
7337640	7338760	I'm Jeff Davis.
7338760	7340920	Spencer Crittenden, your mayor, Jen Herman.
7342280	7343720	Happy birthday, Dustin Marshall.
7343720	7355640	Happy, about-to-be-birthday, Spencer.
