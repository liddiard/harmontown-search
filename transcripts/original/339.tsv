0	17400	How's it going gang?
17400	18400	Let's all just check in.
18400	19400	Let's go around the room.
19400	20400	Everybody say your name and how your day has been.
20400	21400	Is it freezing here?
21400	38600	From MacArthur Park, which is melting in the dark and all that sweet green icing flung
38600	39600	down.
39600	48640	Harman Town is in session everybody.
48640	51280	I'm going to break ranks right now and break tradition.
51280	52680	Rob Cordry is here.
52680	53680	Rob, get out here.
53680	66680	I'm bringing you up first, Rob Cordry, Rob Cordry.
66680	67680	Wherever you like, Rob.
67680	68680	Make yourself company.
68680	75680	Let's bring out Spencer Crittenden, everybody.
75680	77680	Spencer!
77720	81720	Oh yeah!
81720	90720	And the mayor of Harman Town is Dan Anastasia Harman.
90720	93720	Hello, thank you.
93720	98720	Oh, I really want to thank you.
98720	105720	More than a bucket of gratitude.
105760	111760	Yeah, it seems like back in the day you used to thank you in a shorter way.
111760	118760	You used to just say thanks and then go away, but now the gratitude takes all day.
118760	126760	It seems like I say thanks in a song that lasts long.
126760	132760	And then it brings the energy down at the top of the show.
132800	136800	I want to thank you.
136800	139800	I want to thank you.
139800	142800	I got a bucket of gratitude.
142800	150800	I got a thing with the horseshoes and the waterfalls and the raspberries.
150800	156800	Welcome everybody to Harman Town, the greatest show on earth.
156800	159800	You're making some structural changes.
159800	160800	You brought the guest out.
160840	162840	I got excited.
162840	163840	I got excited.
163840	164840	That was really weird.
164840	168840	I'm not a big biblical scholar, but I say don't keep your light under a bushel.
168840	170840	You got a Rob Cordry hiding backstage.
170840	172840	Get the motherfucker out of here.
172840	173840	I had to pee.
173840	174840	I was hoping I'd have time to pee.
174840	175840	Oh, you want to go back?
175840	176840	You go back.
176840	177840	I'll hold it.
177840	178840	I don't mind too.
178840	184840	I'm always jealous when I see Bill Maher clips and he interviews everybody,
184840	187840	but then he holds people captive for his final thoughts bit.
187880	188880	They've clearly been instructed.
188880	190880	You're not allowed to feed back now.
190880	193880	The camera changes angles and then everybody, if you laugh at Bill Maher,
193880	195880	they cut to you laughing, but that's it.
195880	196880	That's all you get.
196880	197880	You can't.
197880	201880	And so that's maybe for my...
201880	205880	I mean, why do we think I have to have an opening and then we bring out the guest?
205880	206880	We don't have a format to the show.
206880	207880	It's ridiculous.
207880	210880	We're terrible people for ever thinking that the show had any form to it.
210880	214880	I'd rather be out here just commenting on everything you're saying.
214920	215920	Yeah.
215920	219920	I have one thing to share that I wanted to make sure I remembered.
219920	220920	First of all, I want to...
220920	221920	I mean, you guys...
221920	224920	I don't know if you've heard this yet and I may be spilling the beans a little bit,
224920	225920	but Chernobyl got a second season.
225920	227920	I'm really excited about it.
227920	229920	It's very popular.
229920	230920	Very popular show.
230920	231920	I mean, they just had...
231920	235920	They don't know what they're going to do yet, but...
235920	238920	There was kind of a will they, won't they between...
238920	239920	I did.
239920	241920	Between the fictional woman that they gave all of the...
241920	243920	Yeah, they're like, by the way, she didn't exist.
243960	244960	And we...
244960	246960	Two birds, because we didn't have a lot of female characters
246960	248960	that weren't just giving birth to deformities.
248960	249960	And so we just...
249960	251960	And arguing with each other about...
251960	252960	But I want to touch my boyfriend.
252960	254960	You can't touch your boyfriend.
254960	255960	He's radioactive.
257960	259960	But it's set in Nantucket Airport.
259960	261960	It's kind of like wings.
263960	264960	I mean, it is...
264960	266960	They're at Chernobyl and they're all...
266960	267960	It is truly...
267960	270960	I mean, I thought this was an uplifting thing about the human psyche.
271000	274000	Because truly, I did definitely...
274000	276000	By the fourth episode, I was...
276000	278000	I did say on more than one occasion,
278000	281000	through the different combinations of the three characters
281000	285000	who are the only people that are not dying rapidly.
285000	287000	I was like, you guys got to fuck or what?
287000	290000	But I thought that was uplifting because it's like...
290000	294000	None of those people are page three...
294000	295000	Material, yeah.
295000	296000	Pin-ups.
296000	297000	And I thought...
297000	299000	I was like, oh, we're not shallow.
299000	300000	We love love.
300040	301040	That's why we ship.
301040	302040	We're not like...
302040	305040	We're not like, hey, you should fuck because you look good together, you know?
305040	306040	It's like...
306040	307040	Just somebody fuck because...
307040	310040	Like, there's so much vulnerability going on here.
310040	311040	Come on, you love her.
311040	312040	Kiss him!
313040	314040	Here's...
314040	315040	I love Chernobyl.
315040	319040	I actually rewatched episode one today just because I was...
319040	321040	I missed it.
321040	323040	And I went back and started watching it.
323040	325040	But there's a love affair with the director.
325040	327040	I don't know if it was the same director all the way through.
327040	328040	Did you know he was?
328040	329040	Have you watched her, Rob?
329080	334080	I watched the half of the first one, but I fell asleep because I was drunk.
335080	336080	That's the way to do it.
336080	337080	Yeah.
337080	339080	I guess the second season, they just...
339080	343080	They had to do a little fudging, but a couple of people go into remission.
343080	346080	Well, they've already announced that Richard Kind is in season two.
346080	347080	Richard Kind?
347080	348080	Yes.
348080	350080	Richard Kind and Ariana Grande.
350080	351080	What?
351080	353080	We need you back.
353080	357080	The cold open of season two is the cat nibbles the rope and the guy falls.
357120	358120	And he's like...
359120	360120	I think Gutenberg is in it.
360120	361120	Wake up!
361120	362120	Wake up, you son of a bitch!
362120	365120	I'm one of the two characters that talks like this.
365120	368120	The good one, not the one that looks like he should be in Pink Floyd.
369120	371120	I'm the guy that looks kind of like Bill Murray.
371120	375120	That's like the good cop, the bad cop guy with you.
375120	376120	I'm the guy.
376120	377120	That guy.
377120	378120	The guy with the inchworm on his hand.
378120	379120	Wake up!
379120	380120	Valerie!
380120	381120	Valerie!
381120	382120	I liked that.
382120	383120	Chernobyl was great.
383120	384120	I can see what all the hubbub was about.
384120	385120	It was quite a compelling...
385160	388160	I thought it was very...
388160	390160	There's no spoilers in saying this.
390160	392160	Structurally...
392160	395160	You can't spoil the end of Chernobyl.
395160	397160	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
397160	399160	I just thought it was...
399160	402160	Well, how would you tell that narrative?
402160	403160	Where would you start?
403160	406160	Would you do a ton of flashing back or a little bit?
406160	408160	Are you going to start in the courtroom and all that stuff?
408160	412160	They really threaded that needle in a fun way.
412200	415200	It was like they start just seconds after the fucking explosion.
415200	417200	If there's one thing I'd take away from Chernobyl, it's the fun.
419200	420200	What a rump!
420200	423200	They start with a little prologue and then I won't spoil that.
423200	425200	But then it's mostly...
425200	430200	They just dig in to everything happening second by second
430200	433200	right after the explosion which you just missed
433200	437200	and then eventually you're going to go back
437200	440200	to all the moments leading up to before the explosion
440240	443240	and that's book ending like all of the...
443240	446240	And you don't really find out what exactly happened until the very end.
446240	451240	They finally explain what the disaster was.
451240	454240	Yeah, it was a Soviet communism.
454240	457240	Wasn't that the disaster?
457240	460240	It was like the USSR was the disaster, right?
460240	462240	Yeah, I mean you would expect...
462240	465240	I guess that's the one thing communism got wrong
465240	468240	is that they tried to save so much money.
468280	471280	That should be capitalism's job. They were so cheap.
471280	473280	They're just like, well, just put graphite on the tips.
473280	477280	That'll be great. It'll give you a little boost when you pop those fucking rods in.
478280	481280	A little more bang for your nuclear buck.
481280	486280	Should we put some walls around in case of what?
486280	490280	In case we want to spend more money, get your ass back in the fucking Kremlin.
490280	493280	I'll fucking turn your ass into the guy with the cane.
493280	495280	Were you strong badges there?
495320	498320	Well, that's everybody in that thing.
498320	500320	Everyone's smoking cigarettes.
500320	503320	I love that the thing blows up and then everyone's like, smoke them if you got them.
503320	509320	I was going to say the director has a love affair with long, lingering shots of a cigarette in an ashtray.
509320	512320	There'll be someone to put a cigarette in an ashtray and then he just slowly...
512320	515320	I think there was their way of saying to you,
515320	520320	I know I'm making a five episode miniseries about a thousand people dying of cancer in front of you.
520360	525360	But hey, you watch Die Hard, they're all smoking in that.
525360	528360	It's basically the same thing.
529360	532360	Just giving yourself cancer in different ways, come on.
532360	535360	And also a building blows up, it's kind of the same.
535360	538360	If you think about it,
538360	540360	Did Die Hard rip off Chernobyl?
540360	543360	The Soviet Union is a lot like Century City.
543360	545360	What do you think about it?
545400	551400	The coolest shot in Chernobyl, I thought, was the shot of looking down at the pre-exploded reactor core
551400	554400	and then the matrix of control runs.
554400	560400	I like when Alan Rickman said to shoot the glass.
562400	564400	Because he was barefoot.
564400	569400	Listen, we have to do one more season.
569400	572400	We're going back to Chernobyl.
572400	574400	We're going back?
575400	577400	Is that your correct answer?
577400	581400	I watched a documentary where they built the big housing that they put over it.
581400	583400	It's going to last a hundred years, I think.
583400	586400	And they built a big house over the top of the thing to contain it.
586400	591400	And they have robots dismantling all the shit over the next thousand years by remote control.
591400	596400	But then they got one dude going down there holding up fireman pants
596400	598400	just so the epilogue can have a shot of them.
598400	601400	By the way, you can't touch these fuckers.
601400	603400	Put them down.
603440	606440	You can be in there for a little while, but you got to get the fuck out.
606440	610440	The work exposure there is like you get like six minutes or something.
610440	614440	Aren't there like a vacations, like Chernobyl vacations now?
614440	618440	You can go to Chernobyl and see like the fucking merry-go-rounds.
618440	622440	I bet they are at competitive rates.
622440	626440	Yeah, it's not expensive.
626440	629440	Yeah, but I was like, well, get rid of those.
629480	633480	Pick up those goddamn fireman pants that you say are still too radioactive to touch
633480	636480	and put them somewhere else, but it's like, well, where are you going to put them?
636480	637480	Keep them in Chernobyl.
637480	638480	I guess it makes sense.
638480	641480	It's kind of counterintuitive at first, but it's like when the dog would shit
641480	645480	and my dad would be like, well, let it dry and we'll sweep it up.
647480	648480	Wait, what?
648480	649480	You know, what are we going to do?
649480	654480	Grab the moist dog shit, smear it on the floor, dab it around, spray and things.
654480	657480	And then our house will be a museum to hygiene.
657520	659520	Now I know what you're talking about.
659520	663520	It's just like, if I can leave it, the dog already shit, we're already pigs.
663520	668520	Nothing's going to change 10 minutes from now except that shit's going to be less gross to touch.
668520	669520	How's your pee pee?
669520	670520	Oh, what was going on?
670520	673520	I don't know. I'm on, I'm on, I'm on Azos.
673520	674520	Azos?
674520	675520	Yeah.
675520	676520	Yeah.
676520	677520	Woo.
677520	678520	Azofans.
678520	679520	My sisters know what I'm talking about.
679520	680520	Girls.
680520	681520	Maximum strength.
681520	685520	You girls do the complimentary cranberry pill pack?
685560	687560	Someone, yes.
690560	692560	I mean, I don't think it's a UTI at this point.
692560	699560	I mean, if you take antibiotics for all of the bottle and then it's like, I'm just, I got, but I got doctor's appointments.
699560	700560	Let's find out.
700560	702560	I got the keys to my house on Wednesday.
702560	703560	Oh yeah?
703560	709560	The way I understand God, although I hope he's not listening or if he gets offended by this kind of thing.
709560	712560	But I just, this is what I've always been terrified of.
712600	715600	It's like, here's your house. Here's your cancer.
715600	718600	Like, why, why wouldn't you do that on the same day?
718600	721600	Like it's how my story should end.
721600	726600	It's like, and I at least get to spike that football in my therapist's office.
726600	730600	Like, I was like, so remember you kept asking me, like, why am I afraid to be happy?
730600	731600	You know?
731600	732600	Yeah. Yeah.
732600	733600	What else then?
733600	735600	Oh, pull up an x-ray.
735600	738600	It's like, what do you think?
738600	740600	Bitch.
741600	745600	Looks like fucking there is a God and he's the devil.
745600	749600	Looks like my misery was keeping people happy and making God happy.
749600	752600	And he was like, spin little top spin.
752600	754600	And then I was like, I got a house.
754600	756600	And he's like, fuck you. I'm done with you.
756600	762600	Like, he's just like, like, like humans are like, yeah, whatever.
762600	767600	I was going to, I was going to, no, but I believe also in case.
768600	770600	Dan doesn't have cancer.
770600	775600	In case one of God's rules is, in case he chooses differently, maybe the,
775600	776600	maybe it goes by the rules.
776600	778600	Like you're supposed to be like, oh, I don't care if I have it.
778600	780600	And I still love God, I guess.
780600	781600	And that's how he doesn't give it to you.
781600	787600	I don't, whatever the rules are, just fuck, just like, leave me alone.
787600	790600	You made my sister retarded for like nothing.
790600	793600	It was just like, it's just, it seems like a mob move.
793600	794600	It's just a mob move.
794600	795600	Nobody did anything.
795600	799600	If you walk into your house and be like, nice sister.
799600	803600	Have fun being famous for your intelligence.
803600	805600	Yeah.
805600	809600	Yeah, you're awning God alongside me.
809600	812600	Like, and don't say too soon, I'm 46.
812600	814600	I've grown up under this thumb.
814600	815600	It's terrifying.
815600	816600	Too late.
816600	819600	You know, it's mafia stuff, you know?
819600	821600	It's just mafia tactics.
822600	825600	If you're going to make a people and you want them to be grateful,
825600	827600	just give out candy.
827600	831600	We've got a whole generation of kids that didn't get beaten
831600	832600	and they're doing fine.
832600	834600	I told you, I went to Disneyland with some of these kids.
834600	836600	They didn't get hit.
836600	837600	They're fine.
837600	838600	They're fine.
838600	839600	They're not killing anybody.
839600	841600	We don't kind of work like this.
841600	843600	You know, God?
843600	847600	Okay, so I'll tell you one thing and then I'll sit down
847600	849600	because it's the format of the show.
850600	853600	Structure is kind of our bag here.
853600	855600	That's what I love about this show.
855600	859600	My old house, I'm still putting some final touches
859600	862600	on the electronic system at the old house, right?
862600	867600	And so, like, oh, if I press this, does the music play
867600	869600	as quickly as it does for a poor person?
869600	870600	Not yet, okay, all right.
870600	872600	Well, that's fine because I'm leaving now,
872600	875600	so we'll just Airbnb it and we'll trick people.
875600	877600	They'll see screens all over the walls and they'll be like,
877600	878600	oh, does Buck Rogers live here?
878600	880600	And I'll be like, yeah, have fun with that.
880600	883600	You're going to be getting a boombox from your car
883600	884600	in 10 minutes.
884600	886600	But, you know, it's the whole thing.
886600	889600	It's like, oh, jeez, you press this button
889600	891600	and then the shades do this and then the whatever.
891600	893600	It's a dream unachieved.
893600	896600	And I was like, this was like the fourth company,
896600	898600	maybe fifth company to come through.
898600	900600	Every company shit talks the last one.
900600	902600	They're like, well, those guys didn't know what they were doing.
902600	903600	And we do.
903600	904600	That's how we're going to do it.
905600	907600	And I just wanted to share.
907600	909600	I mean, everybody does something fucked up.
909600	911600	Everybody does some crazy thing.
911600	913600	And there's buttons everywhere and whatever.
913600	915600	So obviously there's going to be a few bugs to work out.
915600	917600	But they leave and they go like, here you go,
917600	919600	like test it out for a couple of weeks
919600	922600	and then we'll work out the kinks, the little things,
922600	927600	the things that we maybe tend to overlook, little things.
927600	930600	So I go to bed, I go to sleep, I wake up.
930600	933600	I wake up to the sound of the dogs barking
933600	935600	because someone's knocking on the door.
935600	937600	It's Dave Klein, the trainer.
937600	938600	I'm like, what?
938600	939600	I didn't even hear.
939600	940600	Come to think of it.
940600	943600	I don't think I've heard a doorbell in days.
943600	945600	And I go down and I open the door and I go,
945600	946600	did you try the doorbell?
946600	947600	He goes, yup.
947600	948600	Yup.
948600	949600	Yup.
949600	951600	And I go, oh.
951600	955600	Did the doorbell ring just downstairs or whatever?
955600	959600	I heard like a, I did hear like a light tone of some kind
959600	961600	coming from next to the door.
961600	962600	And I was like, okay.
962600	964600	So I go outside, I close the door
964600	969600	and I ring the doorbell and I hear click.
969600	971600	And I try the door.
971600	973600	The doorbell unlocks the front door.
973600	974600	Whoa.
977600	981600	It doesn't even say ding dong and unlock the door.
981600	984600	It keeps the victim sleeping.
984600	986600	Just get some sleep.
986600	988600	This is for the rapist.
989600	991600	That is a huge staff who?
991600	994600	It's like, are there any tweaks you want to do?
994600	998600	Yeah, could you have my gun, could you have my gun open
998600	1001600	in a compartment and just come down?
1001600	1004600	How much for the sword of Damocles?
1004600	1008600	Can I have a giant sword hanging over my bed by a thread?
1008600	1011600	The doorbell opens the door.
1011600	1013600	It's kind of genius.
1013600	1015600	It's like cut out the middle step.
1015600	1019600	For years, we as savages have been an untrusting feather.
1019600	1021600	Oh, ding dong.
1021600	1024600	So like, that means it's time for me to go down
1024600	1025600	and let you in.
1025600	1027600	Ah, bah, says the algorithm.
1029600	1031600	Yeah, so long, knock, knock, who's there?
1031600	1032600	Yeah.
1032600	1034600	Knock, knock, rape.
1035600	1038600	Just skip right to you standing over my bed.
1038600	1041600	Like, you came here to do that.
1041600	1042600	You brought tools.
1042600	1043600	Why use them?
1043600	1046600	Save those tools for a poorer person's house
1046600	1050600	that's going to make you scrape away at the door lock.
1050600	1053600	I'm rich, come on in.
1053600	1055600	Save your pliers.
1055600	1058600	Just get your night vision goggles out and commence.
1058600	1061600	Just, just, just, just put the teacups
1061600	1064600	and the saucers on my back.
1064600	1065600	Ooh.
1065600	1066600	Wait, what?
1066600	1067600	Remember that?
1067600	1068600	You get it, you get it.
1068600	1069600	I don't.
1069600	1070600	He doesn't remember.
1070600	1071600	Rob, explain it to Jeff.
1071600	1072600	I don't remember.
1072600	1073600	What was it?
1073600	1074600	You don't remember?
1074600	1077600	It was the California murderer.
1077600	1078600	Golden state.
1078600	1079600	Golden state killer.
1079600	1080600	Yeah.
1080600	1081600	The California murderer.
1081600	1082600	He put saucers on your back?
1082600	1083600	Oh, he sure did.
1083600	1084600	He sure did, Jeff.
1084600	1085600	He sure did, Jeff.
1085600	1086600	Was I here for that show?
1086600	1087600	I'm sure you were.
1087600	1089600	It's not a show, Jeff.
1089600	1092600	It's a fucking serial killer's MO.
1092600	1094600	Wait, he would have tea while he was...
1094600	1095600	God, no.
1095600	1099600	He would have tea on your back after he killed you, Jeff.
1099600	1101600	He would put clinky china on these husbands.
1101600	1102600	I'm not here for this.
1102600	1103600	If you just...
1103600	1104600	It was a show, man.
1104600	1105600	I don't...
1105600	1106600	He put...
1106600	1107600	I don't know.
1107600	1109600	He put loud stuff on the...
1109600	1111600	Oh, this is terrible.
1111600	1114600	On the husband's back while he raped his wife.
1114600	1119600	So if the husband started moving, it would break the china or whatever.
1119600	1121600	The china would fall up the husband's back.
1121600	1124600	Comedy show!
1124600	1125600	Have you been cordially?
1125600	1128600	What's new with you?
1128600	1130600	Catch us up on what's...
1130600	1131600	Just been up to murdering.
1131600	1132600	Just murdering...
1132600	1134600	Oh, season 93 of Ballers.
1134600	1136600	Season 93 of Ballers.
1136600	1138600	Been murdering people.
1138600	1139600	Ballin'.
1139600	1140600	I'm a baller.
1140600	1141600	You're a baller.
1141600	1142600	Yeah, Ballers is over, I think.
1142600	1143600	What?
1143600	1144600	What?
1144600	1145600	Oh, well, we'll see.
1145600	1146600	Damn.
1146600	1150600	We just finished the season five and that might...
1150600	1151600	Ballers end game?
1151600	1153600	Ballers end game.
1153600	1156600	Then we're gonna do the other, the next...
1156600	1157600	Yeah.
1157600	1159600	Some people in the industry call you the kiss of death
1159600	1161600	because you keep having shows that go on for several seasons
1161600	1163600	and then strangely they just end.
1163600	1165600	It's the best... Yeah.
1165600	1168600	We end after... We end when we want to end.
1168600	1169600	That's... Yeah.
1169600	1170600	It's the kiss of death.
1170600	1171600	You're the kiss of death.
1171600	1172600	You're the Grim Reaper of success.
1172600	1173600	I know.
1173600	1174600	Yeah.
1174600	1175600	Yeah.
1175600	1177600	You know where the expression wheelhouse comes from,
1177600	1179600	like it's in your wheelhouse?
1179600	1180600	No, go ahead.
1180600	1186600	It's like a weird thing, like it's a two-step idiomatic process.
1186600	1192600	It starts with wheel houses like in paddle boats
1192600	1195600	or paddle wheels, like I don't know if it's like stationary for power
1195600	1198600	or whatever, like paddle water wheel technology
1198600	1203600	where it's like if something's in the wheelhouse,
1203600	1207600	it's gonna get the full force of the wheels impact.
1207600	1210600	But then that isn't necessarily like,
1210600	1213600	man, that's your expertise, like it doesn't translate to that.
1213600	1216600	But then baseball used that phrase
1216600	1219600	to like mean that that's in your wheelhouse.
1219600	1221600	It's basically your strike zone.
1221600	1222600	Yeah.
1222600	1224600	It's like you can fucking knock that out of the park.
1224600	1225600	That's in your wheelhouse.
1225600	1228600	Like they're idiomatically,
1228600	1232600	but then we idiomatically are borrowing from baseball
1232600	1235600	and the whole time we're going wheelhouse?
1235600	1238600	I don't know, I'm all looking up one day.
1238600	1240600	I always thought, you know what I would have guessed.
1240600	1243600	My guess was always just like, oh, a wheelhouse
1243600	1245600	is just like an old-timey garage.
1245600	1247600	Like they didn't call them garages.
1247600	1249600	Like they probably called them wheelhouses at first.
1249600	1250600	You thought it was a wheelhouse.
1250600	1252600	Like that's where you park your wheels.
1252600	1254600	Before there were even wagons.
1254600	1255600	Sure.
1255600	1257600	It was like, well, what are you gonna call it?
1257600	1259600	You're not gonna call it a carport.
1259600	1260600	It's a wheelhouse.
1260600	1261600	Sure.
1261600	1264600	And it's like probably where people always did more of their work.
1264600	1268600	Before that they called it, that was in your hoof hut.
1268600	1269600	Right.
1269600	1270600	That's absolutely true.
1270600	1271600	Yeah.
1271600	1274600	That's in your cow's udder.
1274600	1280600	That's in the corner of your cave that you don't shit in.
1280600	1283600	Yeah, that was a clunky, so they had to like...
1283600	1286600	But the word for that was just ug.
1286600	1289600	They just had less words, but this meant more.
1289600	1291600	Like cavemen had like six words.
1291600	1294600	I love baseball metaphors.
1294600	1297600	I'm not even that huge a fan of baseball,
1297600	1301600	but I'm a huge fan of baseball metaphors like strike zone.
1301600	1304600	Like here's my favorite one.
1304600	1306600	Well, you were...
1306600	1308600	The first couple of years at Harmon Town,
1308600	1311600	you were swinging three bats,
1311600	1314600	but now you're up to the plate swinging one bat.
1314600	1316600	No, okay. What does that mean?
1316600	1317600	I don't know.
1317600	1318600	That's my favorite one.
1318600	1321600	It means that you're just hitting fucking home runs now
1321600	1322600	because you're done.
1322600	1325600	You're like, you've not no longer...
1325600	1326600	Okay.
1326600	1328600	Hitting home runs is another baseball metaphor.
1328600	1330600	You're no longer swinging those three heavy bats.
1330600	1331600	You're swinging one light.
1331600	1333600	It feels so much lighter.
1333600	1334600	Follow me.
1334600	1335600	You're swinging...
1335600	1341600	So, Dan, you used to have three big old wooden bats,
1341600	1342600	and you're swinging them.
1342600	1343600	Why would I do that?
1343600	1344600	Just to make my arms stronger?
1344600	1346600	No, you're just figuring out the show,
1346600	1348600	i.e. the bats in your hand.
1348600	1349600	I've always said like...
1349600	1350600	I got this.
1350600	1351600	Okay.
1351600	1353600	No, go ahead, Jeff. Go ahead.
1353600	1354600	No, no, sorry.
1354600	1355600	This is your wheelhouse.
1355600	1356600	You're trying to help me.
1356600	1362600	You used to say like swinging two bats in the on-deck circle.
1362600	1363600	Yeah, yeah, right.
1363600	1364600	Did I not say that part?
1364600	1365600	Does that mean like over-preparing?
1365600	1366600	You said three bats.
1366600	1367600	Oh, shit.
1367600	1368600	Well, I usually...
1368600	1369600	Nobody's ever done three bats.
1369600	1370600	No one's ever done three bats.
1370600	1371600	No one's ever done three bats.
1371600	1372600	The human hand can't hold three bats.
1372600	1373600	I hold three bats, man.
1373600	1374600	Yeah?
1374600	1375600	Whoa.
1375600	1376600	I got huge hands.
1376600	1379600	Does that mean like over-preparing swinging multiple bats?
1379600	1381600	Or is it just preparing generally?
1381600	1383600	Swinging two bats in the on-deck circle is like you're swinging
1383600	1387600	a heavier thing and then you get into the batter's box.
1387600	1389600	This was a super clear metaphor, but...
1389600	1390600	Oh, it was.
1390600	1393600	I feel like I've been using the clunkiest metaphor ever now.
1393600	1394600	Yeah.
1394600	1395600	Well, because what is it...
1395600	1397600	I need to understand the implication of swinging more bats.
1397600	1398600	I don't know.
1398600	1401600	I think maybe because I use it in regards to your show,
1401600	1403600	which has always been great.
1403600	1404600	I think...
1404600	1408600	Do baseball people swing more than one bat because they want
1408600	1411600	their arms to be more accustomed to heavier weight so that when
1411600	1413600	they swing the bat, they're like, this is nothing.
1413600	1418600	Well, when you get up there, your bat speed is faster when you get
1418600	1420600	to the plate because you've been swinging a heavier bat.
1420600	1423600	Because I think right now, these days, or you make your arms tired,
1423600	1426600	they put a weight at the end of their bat now and hold three bats.
1426600	1427600	They put a donut on it.
1427600	1429600	They put a donut on it. Exactly.
1429600	1433600	But it's like putting weights on your ankles before your
1433600	1435600	basketball inning starts.
1435600	1436600	That's right.
1436600	1437600	That's exactly right.
1437600	1440600	You used to wear heavy shorts before you play a basketball inning.
1440600	1444600	If you look in warmups, in warmups, they all wear heavier shorts.
1444600	1445600	Yeah.
1445600	1447600	But I used that metaphor a lot.
1447600	1451600	Like, oh, I was playing with weights on my ankles,
1451600	1453600	and then you take them off.
1453600	1454600	That's the same thing, right?
1454600	1455600	That's the same metaphor.
1455600	1456600	You used that one?
1456600	1461600	I've used it in the past because I've often felt like I was
1461600	1465600	overqualified for a job at hand and was going to go in and just
1465600	1466600	dominate.
1466600	1468600	And I run out of ways to express that.
1469600	1472600	And it's important that I be relatable.
1472600	1476600	Oh, I so regret this metaphor.
1476600	1479600	Give us some more of your favorite baseball metaphors.
1479600	1480600	Okay.
1480600	1482600	That's the end.
1482600	1485600	You want to have a host of relatable ways of explaining your domination to
1485600	1486600	people.
1486600	1490600	Sometimes I have two pickles on my fucking tennis racket and I still
1490600	1491600	fucking...
1491600	1492600	You know what I'm saying, right?
1492600	1493600	You know what I mean.
1493600	1494600	No.
1494600	1495600	Did you see that guy?
1495600	1498600	Fifteen-year-old beat Venus Williams today in Wimbledon.
1498600	1499600	Fifteen years old.
1499600	1500600	Two pickles.
1500600	1505600	She was swinging four tennis rackets before the match.
1505600	1506600	See?
1506600	1507600	No.
1507600	1508600	Fifteen.
1508600	1510600	Fifteen years old.
1510600	1514600	She wasn't even born when Venus had already had four grand slams.
1514600	1518600	Do they still make the lady tennis players wear the little skirts?
1518600	1520600	That's a great question.
1520600	1521600	I don't know.
1521600	1523600	Wimbledon, you have to wear white.
1523600	1525600	You have to wear your Wimbledon whites.
1525600	1528600	Someone in the audience whispered yes.
1528600	1530600	Do they make or do they choose?
1530600	1531600	I mean, I'm sure.
1531600	1535600	Was it a cranberry lady who went, yes.
1535600	1539600	There's no way when you go into Wimbledon, you go into the Westworld
1539600	1542600	antechamber where they're like, pick your tennis outfit.
1542600	1546600	And then Serena Williams reaches for shorts and they're like, uh-uh.
1546600	1548600	Gender foul.
1548600	1550600	You've got to wear a skirt, girl.
1550600	1552600	There's no way that's happened.
1552600	1554600	I think the skirt's probably a good move.
1554600	1556600	You're running them over the shop.
1556600	1558600	Then why don't the guys wear the skirts?
1558600	1559600	That's true.
1559600	1560600	Exactly.
1560600	1561600	Exactly.
1561600	1562600	There's your gender problem.
1562600	1564600	You just said a mouthful there, pal.
1564600	1566600	Why don't guys just wear skirts all the time?
1566600	1567600	They're so comfortable.
1567600	1572600	But I'm saying, it seems clear that there's no distinct, that it's not,
1573600	1578600	uh, uh, uh, uh, related to the, to the, any advantage on court, whether
1578600	1579600	you're wearing shorts or skirts.
1579600	1582600	Otherwise one, both sexes would wear.
1582600	1586600	You're just saying like maybe tennis is like, I'm just curious.
1586600	1589600	I'm always curious about like when you get little outfits involved in any
1589600	1591600	kind of long standing thing.
1591600	1594600	That's like very esteemed and like the people involved are very like,
1594600	1595600	they discipline themselves.
1595600	1596600	I'm like, it's all this stuff.
1596600	1599600	And then in these like turbulent times, I'm like.
1599600	1602600	Are they ever going to, is it, is it, is it, is that, is that I'm always
1602600	1606600	curious, like, is somebody like, man, I didn't come all this way to be the
1606600	1610600	complaint about the skirt lady in Wimbledon.
1610600	1612600	Like it's like, you probably, probably a part of you is like, I'm going to be
1612600	1615600	wearing that skirt and fucking shove this ball down your fucking throat.
1615600	1618600	Like you're, the skirt is part of your fantasy of dominating the world,
1618600	1620600	which is part of your empowerment.
1620600	1622600	It's just, it's fun to think about.
1622600	1625600	I can't watch a beach volleyball.
1625600	1631600	Because I'm always like, yeah, which is all like the tiniest bikinis on the
1631600	1634600	guys on the fellas.
1634600	1637600	It's just on everybody's wearing the tiniest clothes ever.
1637600	1638600	Yeah.
1638600	1644600	And, and I'm always like looking at their eyes and I can't catch the game.
1644600	1646600	So I just don't watch it.
1646600	1647600	I think that's sort of what you're talking about.
1647600	1648600	Yeah.
1648600	1649600	Right.
1649600	1651600	And then I guess I'm always like, I'm always like, I'm always like,
1651600	1655600	but in warmups, they have to wear two bikinis.
1655600	1659600	It just makes it better for the, for game time.
1659600	1661600	I'm always, I'm always like a tornado watch.
1661600	1665600	Like I'm watching the distant horizon of sports outfit problem is to station
1665600	1668600	because I'm like, are they one day going to,
1668600	1671600	are they going to come for the figure skaters?
1671600	1672600	Yeah.
1672600	1674600	And is it going to be all about talent one day?
1674600	1677600	First, they come for the figure skaters.
1677600	1678600	Yeah.
1678600	1680600	And is it going to be all about talent one day?
1680600	1685600	First, they came for the figure skaters.
1685600	1692600	But I, yeah, I mean, I think I, I enjoy figure skating for the wrong reasons.
1692600	1694600	I don't enjoy it.
1694600	1695600	I do.
1695600	1701600	And I am impressed with the prowess and the discipline, but it just makes me nervous.
1701600	1702600	Yeah.
1702600	1705600	Gymnastics and figure skating is too stressful because when they leave
1705600	1707600	and then it's like, they're either going to, yeah, it's like,
1707600	1712600	yeah, it's like, it seems so impossible what they're doing.
1712600	1715600	You're wearing knives on your feet and you're jumping in the air
1715600	1718600	and you're on a cold, hard, deadly surface.
1718600	1722600	And the fact that they're not carted off on a gurney after it,
1722600	1724600	they should all win a medal for that.
1724600	1728600	If you fall on that surface, your skin's going to stick to it, first of all.
1728600	1730600	Oh, if you fall tongue first, you're fucking done.
1730600	1731600	You're fucked.
1731600	1732600	You're fucking done, baby.
1732600	1733600	You're done.
1733600	1734600	Yeah, you're sunk.
1734600	1735600	Yeah.
1735600	1738600	You're wearing a knife on your feet and you got to run around.
1738600	1739600	It's fucking crazy.
1739600	1740600	And you know what?
1740600	1741600	Yes, you should wear sequins.
1741600	1744600	If you're going to die, fucking go out with some zazz.
1744600	1747600	I can't watch the balance beam.
1747600	1749600	It makes me want to fucking have a heart attack.
1749600	1750600	Yeah, I can't watch it.
1750600	1752600	It's too much, man.
1752600	1754600	Balance beam, stop it.
1754600	1755600	Don't do it.
1755600	1756600	Don't do that.
1756600	1757600	Don't do the horse.
1757600	1759600	That's never going to come into play in real life.
1759600	1762600	You're never going to have to fucking do a fucking backflip on a stick.
1762600	1765600	Flipping from one end of the pads to the other end of the pads.
1765600	1767600	Yeah, and if you step out, you're a fucking dick.
1767600	1768600	Fuck that.
1768600	1769600	Yeah.
1769600	1770600	What do you think?
1770600	1775600	I can't believe that shit when they do the flip and the land and the beam.
1775600	1776600	It's impossible.
1776600	1777600	They're superheroes.
1777600	1781600	Yeah, they should all be president after even surviving.
1781600	1783600	Yes, they should fight crime.
1783600	1784600	They shouldn't be doing that shit.
1784600	1786600	They should be fighting crime.
1786600	1789600	I think their bones are all splintered and they're miserable and stuff.
1789600	1792600	Oh, they're not going to live long.
1792600	1795600	They're mostly gothic now.
1795600	1800600	I saw the documentary about the Larry Nasser thing.
1800600	1804600	There's a lot of grown-up former gymnasts.
1804600	1808600	You can see the trauma in the face.
1808600	1816600	I learned one thing from that documentary that I was blown away by,
1816600	1821600	which is that there was an active threshold that prior to a certain year
1821600	1825600	in the Olympics, women's gymnastics meant literally women,
1825600	1830600	which was like 25-year-old women jumping around, doing their best.
1830600	1836600	The idea of having a child do this thing was the same as a child
1836600	1839600	doing any of the other things.
1839600	1844600	Then this guy pioneered the art and science of, yeah,
1844600	1847600	but when you're 13, you're like, bar, bar, bar,
1847600	1854600	and just started winning gold medals like a factory by a children's crusade.
1854600	1859600	Now women's gymnastics means kids because I didn't know that that was a thing
1859600	1864600	that just someone invented on top of...
1864600	1867600	I didn't either. I didn't watch that documentary.
1867600	1869600	Was it Bella Crowley?
1869600	1872600	I think it was the Bella guy. I think that was the guy.
1872600	1877600	He was like the big Ben Franklin of child exploitation,
1877600	1879600	and gold medals, and gold medals.
1879600	1881600	I think it was the BC boys who said,
1881600	1885600	I'm hugging more girls than Bella Correll.
1885600	1888600	It's a fucking lyric.
1888600	1893600	Yeah, but there's words in those lyrics that made the millennials hear the words
1893600	1895600	and they had to say Jesus to it.
1895600	1898600	It's too soon for you to say those words that were in those lyrics.
1898600	1901600	Yeah, man. He just died. Ad-Roc, is that his name?
1901600	1902600	Oh, yeah, he did.
1902600	1903600	Too soon.
1903600	1904600	Too soon.
1904600	1908600	Continuing our in memoriam section, we have lost...
1908600	1910600	Who else? Who else is in the news?
1910600	1911600	We've lost our audio guy.
1911600	1912600	Wait, Ad-Roc died?
1912600	1914600	I think, right? Was it Ad-Roc?
1914600	1915600	NCA died.
1915600	1917600	Oh, I got them all mixed up.
1917600	1919600	Oh, God damn it, man.
1919600	1924600	You just killed Ad-Roc and then brought him back to life.
1924600	1925600	The BC boys are like...
1925600	1926600	Holy shit.
1927600	1929600	I'm going to say that Mike Dee dies in 48 hours.
1929600	1930600	Shut up.
1930600	1933600	We've already lost and then two-thirds of the BC boys...
1933600	1934600	That's the one-third of them.
1934600	1935600	That's the Jeff Davis guarantee.
1935600	1937600	Mike Dee is dead in 48 hours.
1937600	1939600	Christ.
1939600	1942600	We're losing our audio guy, Chris Baruff.
1942600	1943600	Well, we lost him.
1943600	1944600	Last week was his last week.
1944600	1945600	He's still here though.
1945600	1948600	He's still here hunting us like the Phantom of the Opera.
1948600	1949600	I think he's bluffing.
1949600	1950600	Why do you leave him?
1950600	1955600	He's training our replacement audio guy,
1955600	1956600	who's stepping up.
1956600	1958600	Nolan's going to take over his position,
1958600	1959600	so he's doing us the...
1959600	1961600	Who's this fellow right up here?
1961600	1962600	I think that's probably Zach.
1962600	1963600	That's Zach, yeah.
1963600	1964600	Not just Zach.
1964600	1965600	He's doing great.
1965600	1967600	I don't know why I was passed over for that role.
1967600	1968600	I'm pretty confident.
1969600	1970600	How do you think I feel?
1970600	1971600	Right.
1971600	1973600	Has another fellow just smoked his head out?
1973600	1975600	Yeah, he doesn't want to be left alone.
1975600	1978600	Anyways, but last week would have been the right episode
1978600	1981600	to do this, but for years now,
1981600	1987600	service, the quality audio, the Johnny on the Spot stunt work
1987600	1991600	of doing these live broadcasts that we do,
1991600	1995600	that you guys are not hearing any feedback,
1995600	1998600	and it's going out live to people that pay a subscription fee,
1998600	2001600	and then a couple days later, it's all rubber banded
2001600	2005600	and nicely mixed and dumping for free on the hoi polloi,
2005600	2011600	and we've been spoiled in our diaper of amazing audio care,
2011600	2013600	and it's all due to Chris Buruff,
2013600	2015600	so give him a hand for...
2020600	2023600	Hopefully he's dumping my audio down as I applaud him.
2023600	2026600	Is he like fucking off to Airwolf or some shit?
2026600	2029600	He's already fucked off to the Game Grumps.
2029600	2031600	Is it really Game Grumps?
2031600	2032600	Oh, yeah.
2032600	2033600	Oh, that's cool.
2033600	2034600	Can we say that?
2034600	2037600	I got a job offer that's kind of fucked up of them, though.
2037600	2038600	No, I'm kidding.
2038600	2039600	They're poaching.
2039600	2041600	If they had called me and said,
2041600	2044600	who's the best audio guy in the world...
2044600	2046600	So Game Grumps poached Chris off of us?
2046600	2047600	Yeah, that's good.
2047600	2049600	But they're giving him more.
2049600	2050600	He can't refuse the thing.
2050600	2053600	He's got little Chris Buruff's in the oven.
2053600	2054600	No, he doesn't.
2054600	2056600	I just mean his testicles.
2056600	2058600	He just likes to take care of his testicles.
2058600	2060600	His pants are in oven.
2060600	2063600	That's why we strive to succeed.
2063600	2065600	But I mean, that's a lot of service for...
2065600	2067600	I mean, this is a labor of love,
2067600	2069600	this little cottage industry we've got.
2069600	2071600	It's not like we're...
2071600	2072600	We're not like exploiting people,
2072600	2075600	but at the same time, we're definitely not Google.
2075600	2076600	Wait, do they exploit people?
2076600	2077600	Yeah.
2077600	2078600	Oh, yeah.
2078600	2079600	All right.
2079600	2080600	Well, wait.
2080600	2081600	Who are the non-exploitors?
2081600	2082600	No one.
2082600	2086600	I'm one of those businesses where I'm like,
2086600	2090600	hey, take 10% of everything we make.
2090600	2091600	You know.
2092600	2095600	And I want that to be a billion dollars,
2095600	2096600	but it often isn't.
2096600	2098600	And then there's like, you know,
2098600	2101600	it's like you get a little salary on top of it.
2101600	2104600	But I like that we have a little bio-dome
2104600	2106600	of people getting paid.
2106600	2109600	Well, that's really like, it's kind of revolutionary
2109600	2114600	that this is a place where people can start climbing, right?
2114600	2117600	Working and then start climbing.
2117600	2120600	And that they're still getting paid is really cool.
2120600	2122600	Yeah, I've launched a lot of rockets.
2122600	2123600	Oh, shit.
2123600	2124600	You know.
2124600	2125600	Okay.
2125600	2127600	You know, they're...
2127600	2128600	Who's your favorite rocket?
2128600	2130600	I didn't set out to a...
2130600	2132600	You know, I mean...
2132600	2133600	Oh, shit.
2133600	2134600	Donald Glover.
2134600	2136600	I mean, I would count you among them, yeah.
2136600	2137600	Oh.
2137600	2139600	I kind of found you in the streets, like...
2139600	2140600	Yeah.
2140600	2141600	Right.
2141600	2142600	The Daily Show.
2142600	2143600	You created...
2143600	2146600	You found me in the streets of the Daily Show.
2146600	2148600	That's what I would do, is I would hang up.
2148600	2152600	I was like, please, I invite you to do community on NBC.
2152600	2153600	Yeah.
2153600	2154600	I just hung out.
2154600	2155600	I was like, oh, poor little...
2155600	2156600	Who's this little British guy?
2156600	2157600	It's like, oh, John Oliver.
2157600	2158600	Why don't you come play a little...
2158600	2160600	Come on, little British guy over here.
2160600	2161600	Oh, thank you, sir.
2161600	2162600	Thank you.
2162600	2164600	That's true.
2164600	2165600	That's true.
2165600	2167600	Food, glorious food.
2167600	2169600	Then that motherfucker was like, I don't need you.
2169600	2170600	Yeah.
2170600	2172600	But you know what he did do?
2172600	2174600	And I'm not saying this is what you or Chris have to do.
2174600	2175600	Revolutionized news.
2175600	2176600	He mentioned me in an interview.
2176600	2177600	They said...
2177600	2179600	So there was in some interview with somebody that was a big thing.
2179600	2182600	It was like, John Oliver's the greatest guy in the world.
2182600	2185600	And they'd be like, let's talk all about him because he's the greatest.
2185600	2186600	He's doing the Lord's work.
2186600	2189600	And they were like, what's somebody you learned something from?
2189600	2191600	And he was like, Dan Hallman.
2191600	2194600	He probably didn't say it in that accent or at that volume.
2194600	2195600	He probably said it with a British accent.
2195600	2196600	All right.
2196600	2202600	You know, it hit me.
2202600	2210600	Guys like him and guys like Colbert were always like, I'm getting these opportunities, right?
2210600	2218600	But all I want to do is read the news in the morning and send the news into the joke pipe.
2218600	2221600	And then at night, I want to do jokes about the news.
2221600	2223600	That's what you want to do?
2223600	2225600	No, I have no interest in doing that.
2225600	2226600	I don't know.
2226600	2227600	Those guys did.
2227600	2228600	Yeah.
2228600	2230600	I mean, John Oliver in particular, you really have to admire his like...
2230600	2231600	Yes.
2231600	2232600	He absolutely...
2232600	2233600	Sam B, too.
2233600	2239600	I don't know of Colbert or Samantha, but I definitely know because he worked on our show
2239600	2241600	and we had to negotiate with his guy.
2241600	2242600	He's the same kind of person.
2242600	2251600	He had lots and lots of carrots dangling of like just, no, why don't you just be the fucking
2251600	2253600	guy in this Adam McKay movie or whatever the fuck.
2253600	2254600	Yeah.
2254600	2255600	Like, you know, like...
2255600	2256600	Be an actor.
2256600	2257600	And he didn't want to...
2257600	2258600	Not interested.
2258600	2261600	Definitely, absolutely wanted to do the exact thing that he's doing.
2261600	2262600	And they both told me.
2262600	2264600	They were like, I don't...
2264600	2267600	This is what I've been working up to and I don't want to do it.
2267600	2272600	I just discovered by doing the Daily Show that I want to just be making jokes about the
2272600	2273600	news all the time.
2273600	2275600	That takes a lot of...
2275600	2276600	It sounds terrifying.
2276600	2277600	And I always...
2277600	2284160	You guys are all younger than me and I always look at you guys as grownups because I watched
2284160	2292720	the Daily Show when I was at the height of my fear of having to move back to Milwaukee
2292720	2297600	as if that's what you do when you fail in Los Angeles, like the city you leave welcomes
2297600	2298600	you at the airport.
2298600	2300720	We all actually have to move back to Milwaukee.
2300720	2303880	Even if we haven't lived there before, that's where we go.
2303880	2306080	That's what I was like, oh, all these guys are grownups.
2306080	2307880	Those people in Milwaukee aren't from Milwaukee.
2307880	2308880	They're all...
2308880	2309880	They just failed the showrunners.
2309880	2310880	They weren't from Hollywood.
2310880	2311880	Yeah.
2311880	2315480	They'd be like, look at all these grownups doing news jokes.
2315480	2319680	Milwaukee is the news joke capital.
2319680	2320680	Second tier.
2320680	2321680	The Daily Show, man.
2321680	2322680	You guys.
2322680	2329440	But then I'm like, I hate reading John Oliver's age when you read a thing about him.
2329440	2332520	I'm like, oh God, he's younger than me.
2332520	2335800	I feel like you might be...
2335800	2339720	You weren't looking at me like that, though, because I was the dick joke guy on the Daily
2339720	2340720	Show.
2340720	2345160	I was never like the let's nail the news, let's really get these motherfuckers.
2345160	2348560	I was like, well, what about poo?
2348560	2353880	I'll take your word for it, but I really don't know how it worked on that show.
2353880	2358520	My perception as a viewer was that everyone was like a face value thing, that everyone
2358520	2361360	was a kind of like little producer of their own bits and stuff.
2361360	2362360	Well, that's true.
2362360	2365640	Was that like one of your remote gigs and you would go out and do a piece?
2365640	2368560	Is that something that you had come up with or is that producers and writers coming up
2368560	2369560	with stuff?
2369560	2372160	Well, that's the great thing about the Daily Show is that everybody on the show could pitch
2372160	2377680	those bits, could pitch those pieces, and John would be the ultimate voice of, well,
2377680	2380480	this is gonna get done and this is gonna get done and this is gonna get done.
2380480	2382520	And we would basically write...
2382520	2388960	Me and a producer would write what we set out to get.
2388960	2391840	And then we would never get that thing.
2391840	2395720	We would get something completely different and we'd come back and edit it and John would
2395720	2400560	come back into the room and help to craft it and it would become something totally different
2400560	2403120	and always something better.
2403120	2406000	But with me, they weren't like...
2406000	2409040	I was always the dumbest guy in the room.
2409040	2413840	And I learned how to be the dumbest guy in the room and I learned how to be the...
2413840	2418240	Because Rob Riggle would come in and be like with his pipe and his magnifying glass.
2418240	2424560	Rob replaced me, so I never had to be the second dumbest guy in the room.
2424560	2429400	Rob definitely was like, hey, I'll be the dumbest guy now, get out of here.
2429400	2431520	Your number's up, dummy.
2431520	2434960	Yeah, neither of us gave a shit about...
2434960	2438560	We didn't understand what we were making jokes about.
2438560	2442000	We were just like pooing dicks.
2442000	2447800	But there was a time when I got addicted to it and I was at the debates, right?
2447800	2452400	Where I was in New Hampshire and I was watching two C-SPANs at once.
2452400	2455120	Because there's two of those shits.
2455120	2456120	And I was watching...
2456120	2457120	C-SPAN.
2457120	2459280	C-SPAN 2 is where it gets kind of dirty.
2459280	2465080	And John Stewart, to his credit, called C-SPAN the security camera of news.
2465080	2466840	Because it was literally...
2466840	2470080	I was watching it and it was sweeping this...
2470080	2475440	And there's Rob Reiner talking to John McCain.
2475440	2480440	And then you'd pass again and there's Rob Reiner talking to John McCain again.
2480440	2483880	And there's Dennis Kucinich and there he goes.
2483880	2487320	And I was obsessed with it and then I realized, like, what am I doing?
2487320	2488320	But...
2488320	2490640	This is never gonna be an interesting area of...
2490640	2494320	This is not my felt by person, this is not who I am.
2494320	2495320	But I loved my time there.
2495320	2498200	To what level did you have to become a news junkie yourself?
2498200	2499200	I just...
2499200	2500560	Well, like I was saying before, right?
2500560	2505000	I realized I was the dumbest guy in the room.
2505000	2510720	But that's a good thing in that I realized, like, for the first time in my life, I wasn't
2510720	2514680	trying to be smarter than I was.
2514680	2517360	So then I realized that I wasn't that dumb.
2517360	2519360	I wasn't as dumb as I thought I was.
2519360	2520360	But I...
2520360	2521360	From...
2521360	2522360	Does that make any sense?
2522360	2523360	Yeah.
2523360	2524360	Yeah.
2524360	2525360	Yeah.
2525360	2526360	Yeah.
2526360	2527360	Yeah.
2527360	2528360	Yeah.
2528360	2529360	Yeah.
2529360	2530360	Yeah.
2530360	2531360	Yeah.
2531360	2532360	Yeah.
2532360	2533360	Yeah.
2533360	2534360	Yeah.
2534720	2535720	I mean, it was like a box.
2535720	2540720	These comedy, like, fucking ninjas.
2540720	2542840	And then I just felt comfortable, and then I got it.
2542840	2544260	I got the whole thing.
2544260	2548800	But then they got me, and they still realized that I was the poo and dick guy.
2548800	2552880	Who are the people that go through and watch everything and collate?
2552880	2560960	Like, even like on John Oliver, on Last Week Tonight or whatever, there's people that edit,
2560960	2561960	and now this.
2561960	2563600	And there's a bunch of clips.
2563600	2565760	How does somebody go through all of that shit?
2565760	2566760	Oh, yeah.
2566760	2568320	So, all right, there's this guy on The Daily Show.
2568320	2569320	He's still there.
2569320	2570320	And he's been there since the beginning.
2570320	2571320	Oh, really?
2571320	2572320	It's Adam Chodikoff.
2572320	2573320	John Oliver didn't get him, because you...
2573320	2574320	No.
2574320	2575320	I know.
2575320	2576320	No.
2576320	2577320	There's a lot...
2577320	2578320	John Oliver snatched up a lot of guys.
2578320	2579320	Colbert snatched up a lot of guys.
2579320	2580320	But there's still this dude.
2580320	2583560	I still think he's on The Daily Show, and his name's Adam Chodikoff.
2583560	2586280	And he knows everything about everything.
2586280	2587280	And he's the one that's like...
2587280	2588280	He comes in every morning.
2588280	2592640	He's like, pull a clip on fucking Trump in Korea.
2592640	2597080	Oliver characterized him as superhuman, and he has the same set of community.
2597080	2600080	I was like, how does that happen when you catch a politician in a lie?
2600080	2601080	And he mentioned Chodikoff.
2601080	2602080	Yeah.
2602080	2603080	He's a genius.
2603080	2604080	He said, there's this guy...
2604080	2605080	He's literally genius.
2605080	2609040	And the key is that the guy is like, he's retaining enough, because you could have all
2609040	2612980	the equipment and all the hard drives in the world, but it wouldn't matter if you didn't...
2612980	2619280	When you heard the Democratic National Convention say something about taxes, and you go, okay,
2619280	2623040	that thing that she just said, she said the opposite of that.
2623040	2624040	I know she did.
2624040	2627360	I only now have to go look for it, but to have it in your head...
2627360	2628360	Yeah.
2628360	2632240	Well, he was the guy in the room that Jon Stewart was like, that guy is as smart as
2632240	2633240	I am.
2633240	2636920	And he was like, Adam, am I right about this?
2636920	2639600	And I'd be like, well, here's the thing.
2639600	2648520	And he'd launch into this dissection of economic policy, and Jon would be like, got it.
2648520	2650400	Here's the joke.
2650400	2653760	And so he was just this resource, and still is, I believe.
2653760	2655080	I think he's still there.
2655080	2656080	Yeah.
2656080	2661680	But there's a recent bit on John Oliver's show where they just cut to one of the Fox
2661680	2665960	News twats saying the same thing a thousand times.
2665960	2671160	But that means somebody had to watch that every episode of Fox News, The Morning Show,
2671160	2672160	whatever it was.
2672160	2678440	Just to collate all that information and to make a giant edited piece out of every iteration
2678440	2680200	of that stupid thing that they do.
2680200	2684600	Well, there's always somebody on every TV show that recycles the news and makes jokes
2684600	2688000	about it that watches TV for a living.
2688000	2689000	Right.
2689000	2690000	Right?
2690000	2691000	Yeah.
2691000	2692000	On The Howard Stern Show, it's JD.
2692000	2695400	His job is watching TV.
2695400	2699360	And these guys have this talent of doing what you said.
2699360	2702400	Just collecting and finding patterns.
2703400	2709840	And then there's a system of who to send it to, to make it into jokes that somebody says.
2709840	2711800	Part of that feels like the funnest job in the world.
2711800	2713160	It's the watching part.
2713160	2719680	But then I know I would be so stressed out because of the sense of responsibility.
2719680	2723680	When you read a Sherlock Holmes story or any of these takeoffs where it's like, oh, the
2723680	2730800	whole point is that while everyone else was thinking about Moriarty's knife, I was noticing
2730800	2736200	that the air freshener was this, that it's the same part of the brain that makes you
2736200	2742280	good at chess and Stratego and all these crosswords and things that I, they freak me out.
2742280	2744280	Stratego is a fucking great game.
2744280	2745680	Stratego is a good game.
2745680	2747880	Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
2747880	2749920	It's really fun though, right?
2749920	2754800	All I know about Stratego is that it's like people that risk are like, yikes.
2754800	2758200	Oh, I like the spy, I think is the spy part of it.
2758200	2759200	Yeah, the bomb.
2759200	2760200	Yeah, the bomb.
2760200	2764560	Oh my God, that game fucking rocks.
2764560	2765560	Strategy freaks me out.
2765560	2768200	Like I, cause I just always feel like I get burnt in strategy.
2768200	2770400	Oh, that's all I, I can't play games.
2770400	2773280	I'm not good at games until I know the strategy.
2773280	2774280	Yeah.
2774280	2778800	And then my, then I fuck with my kids.
2778800	2781960	I'm at my, I'm at my worst when I'm thinking a move or more.
2781960	2782960	Yeah.
2782960	2783960	Oh, it takes me a while.
2783960	2784960	I'm really shitty at games.
2784960	2788160	I'm also not at my best when I'm not thinking ahead, but I know you're like, is he giving
2788160	2790320	himself credit for being a genius in the moment?
2790320	2795400	Cause, but I'm just, I'm just not the more, yeah, it just, it panics me.
2795400	2800280	Like I always like starts as like, I think that consciously thinking about what, what
2800280	2806040	I'm supposed to be doing, like fucks me up and I'm panicked until I figure that part
2806040	2807040	of it out.
2807040	2808040	And it's usually not that complicated.
2808040	2811640	It's usually like, Oh, I gotta go left when these guys go, right.
2811640	2814840	I guess you're talking about the joy of like finding your bit and then you know what to
2814840	2815920	go after.
2815920	2820400	And then having like a well of like, like I enjoy that sensation of like looking and
2820400	2821880	like fucking around.
2821880	2824680	And then you're like, wait, I know what the bit is.
2824680	2825680	That's exactly what it is.
2825680	2826680	Yeah.
2826680	2828600	It's like, it's what you're describing coming up with the remote pieces too.
2828600	2832560	It's like you had to chart a course by some star had to go out there and say, well, here's
2832560	2835560	our angle, but what we're really going to do is an interview and we'll make sure we
2835560	2836560	have one thing in the can.
2836560	2839160	And then you come back and in the bay, you're kind of like, wait a minute.
2839160	2840760	We've got a new angle.
2840760	2845560	How many times did you guys then like fundamentally change the opener to the remote piece?
2845560	2853200	So, so that's really, so we had a lot of fun zeroing in on that, you know, that thing.
2853200	2855560	And then we'd come back, like I said, and it'd be wrong.
2855560	2861200	And then we'd have a lot of fun and edit zeroing in on it again and trying to figure it out.
2861200	2862200	I think that's what you're talking about.
2862200	2863200	Yeah.
2863200	2864200	Yeah.
2864200	2865200	Yeah.
2865200	2868080	Hey, Dan, real quick, just to clarify, I think you mistakenly called Chris Boroff the audio
2868080	2869080	guy.
2869080	2870080	He's the, he's the video.
2870920	2874240	He's Chris is the live video director of Harmon town.
2874240	2878960	Oh, I stripped out a channel or two from his, uh, yeah, you're right.
2878960	2883360	He's, he's the live editing director, he's the director of the camera mounts and all
2883360	2884360	the stuff.
2884360	2885760	And he's the, he's the editor of the video.
2885760	2887400	Did they say that in some kind of a headset?
2887400	2888400	Yeah.
2888400	2889400	That was like two hours ago.
2889400	2893160	Did you just get like, uh, so really, Jeff, you're the comptroller.
2893160	2898680	No, he's, he's Zach and Chris pointed that out via text just now.
2898680	2900800	He texted me, but I didn't say anything.
2900800	2906280	I didn't get a text from anybody and now he's the, now he's, now he's the producer at game
2906280	2907280	grumps.
2907280	2908280	So we got that all.
2908280	2909280	All right.
2909280	2910280	All right.
2910280	2911280	Well, and we're promoting Zach to head of texting.
2911280	2912280	All right.
2912280	2917880	So I would say, uh, being that, that diminished by Harmon town is the equivalent of swinging
2917880	2920120	three podcast bats.
2920120	2921120	That's a great analogy.
2921120	2922120	See, right?
2922120	2923120	That's a great analogy.
2923120	2926360	I mean, it's like, at least Chris Boroff gets to like, is back there packing his bag and
2926360	2929480	I left at the right place.
2929480	2933120	They don't even know what I did.
2933120	2934120	Great ton.
2934120	2937280	They, they missed like, like a half of what I do.
2937280	2938280	It's the big half.
2938280	2939280	It's your eyeballs.
2939280	2940280	It's the biggest half.
2940280	2944640	I think we should also give a big shout out to Zach McKeeber for craft services.
2944640	2949760	Nobody makes peanut butter sandwich like Zach McKeeber on craft service backstage.
2949760	2952280	That's all he does is make sandwiches.
2952280	2957040	Your mic, your mic, the, that, that your, your feed is just racist, uh, quotes from
2957040	2958040	Hitler.
2958040	2959400	Now he just swapped it out.
2959400	2960400	You just threw the kettle.
2960400	2961400	One cap on the ground.
2961400	2962400	I'd throw it.
2962400	2963400	I dropped it.
2963400	2964400	Cause I'm drunk.
2964400	2965400	Google it.
2965400	2966400	Google.
2966400	2967400	Google.
2967400	2977360	Google drunk, uh, Siri, uh, what is alcoholism, uh, anybody noticing Siri getting more aggressive
2977360	2978360	at all?
2978360	2981560	Or is it, or is it just that I'm festooned with I devices as I get older?
2981560	2985840	I always answer as you when you're not talking to writers room two days ago and I was like
2985840	2989760	stammering through some explanation of like, cause I'm like, this, it's like, uh, it's
2989760	2990760	like that.
2990760	2991760	It's like this.
2991760	2995240	Remember when Pete Holmes did his impression of me, like, like, I was like trying to ask
2995240	2996960	him a question and he was like, what are you at?
2996960	2997960	And I'm like, well, what?
2997960	2998960	No, you know what I'm asking?
2998960	3003320	He's like, well, I think you might be going, uh, but then he kind of like, like, seriously,
3003320	3007520	like I, if I say anything close to Siri in the midst of talking in the writer's room,
3007520	3012400	like every once in a while, like this, my watch or my phone will cut me off halfway
3012400	3013400	through.
3013400	3017480	And it's this like woman in a tin can mocking me.
3017480	3019960	There's just going like, I don't know what you're talking about.
3019960	3023040	Well now it's no, it's just like, it's like, she thinks I can't find the answer to that.
3023040	3027240	It's just reading back to the, what I heard was, I think it's like this, but logistically
3027240	3030840	it should be that, but from a standpoint of internal logic, it's more like that.
3030840	3034840	But what we should do is break the rules before we define them because in truth, like maybe
3034840	3035840	defining them.
3035840	3039560	Well, it's not to say this, is that what you meant?
3039560	3043440	And all the writers are like, she nailed you.
3043440	3048800	Like we can get fired, but that bitch got you down.
3048800	3049800	I'll do the thing.
3049800	3054400	If I'm in the car and I'll go, uh, like tell Bill Davis, my brother, like tell Bill Davis
3054400	3059280	that I'll be over at 11 30 and I'll cough or something like that, tell Bill Davis, fuck
3059280	3060280	shit.
3061200	3063280	And she goes, sounds interesting.
3066760	3068440	What are we fucking a couple?
3068440	3070080	Like, like, give me a break.
3070080	3071120	These are the worst.
3071120	3073040	Like they get out of my life.
3074040	3077120	I don't, I'm never going to, I'm not going to talk to you.
3077120	3078640	Never ask her anything.
3078640	3080520	I'm never going to, I'm yeah, I'm not doing it.
3080520	3083040	Like, why did baby boomers take to that?
3083400	3084600	Why are they so into that?
3084600	3085080	Just them?
3085080	3085680	Yeah.
3085680	3086920	Why did it like skip?
3086920	3088120	Is it going to skip a generation?
3088120	3091880	Is it just like, cause like, you know, text from your mom to just now have this like,
3091880	3096080	like, like my mother's text because they're now there.
3096080	3098720	And then it'll just be like, like, what are you?
3098720	3100360	Are you a beat poet or
3104160	3105480	your father's doing fine.
3105480	3114640	His glaucoma is axing up, uh, uh, but, uh, barf, barf, uh, a Pluto Nash, uh, like,
3114640	3117640	like, like, and then, and then at the end it's just like, sorry, I'm using Siri.
3118400	3119000	That's right.
3119000	3120040	Pluto Nash.
3121360	3124920	I'm like, you're having this con this entire conversation with me, which I actually regard
3124920	3128800	as somewhat intimate because it's with my mom, but you're at like Sam's club barking
3128800	3134840	into the, like, like, and another thing about, wow, and the phone's just getting a little
3134840	3135440	bit of it wrong.
3135440	3136240	But you're like, fuck it.
3136240	3136800	Send it.
3136880	3137480	Who cares?
3137520	3138720	It's just a son.
3140560	3140720	Yeah.
3140720	3144280	She makes no, my mother makes no effort to correct anything.
3144320	3144520	Yeah.
3144520	3145840	What does it pull down a year?
3146520	3148120	Having him for a kid, whatever.
3148120	3151880	Like I, I finished my job when he didn't get polio.
3155560	3157160	Like he's, he's over 18.
3157160	3157680	Fuck him.
3157680	3159280	Send him the jarbled text.
3160880	3163360	I got, I got medical bills to save up for.
3164000	3165760	I don't give a shit what he reads.
3165840	3169160	Let him, let him judge me in my, well, I'm fucking six feet under.
3169160	3170640	I'll be laughing up dirt.
3173040	3174160	Laughing up dirt.
3175520	3177280	That's the name of the episode.
3177280	3177840	I hope so.
3179120	3181000	I like problematization.
3181600	3182440	That's a pretty good one.
3182480	3183400	I couldn't, I couldn't get it out.
3183400	3184400	I couldn't get it all the way out.
3188160	3190200	Have you talked to the, have you talked to the mom and dad recently?
3190200	3197320	How, how, how, how can I really, I told you my niece is a violinist and, uh, then that
3197320	3199040	she's, uh, from Bones.
3199360	3199920	Yeah.
3200400	3206320	But she's like, like, she's, uh, she's going, she's your daughter's age, I believe.
3206400	3211440	Oh, I think she's like 13 and she's, uh, but she's, she's like a violin.
3211720	3212840	Maybe the word prodigy.
3212840	3216080	I don't know, but like, she's been asked to be in the Milwaukee
3216080	3221000	symphony, uh, twice, uh, the Milwaukee, I'm sorry, Milwaukee children's symphony.
3221000	3221600	God damn it.
3224480	3225160	Same thing.
3225720	3230040	I mean, have you heard the Milwaukee symphony?
3230040	3233520	It's like, it's like, it's like the college, it's all the Hollywood failures.
3233760	3234440	Just go right.
3234440	3237520	So it's all like show runners.
3240920	3242520	Just lazy people in the tube.
3243440	3246840	I paid my dues and the children's to Milwaukee.
3248840	3249080	Yeah.
3249080	3252120	It's just old people from, from the Boston symphony.
3252120	3252520	Right.
3253520	3259520	And the pops, uh, uh, when all of our zoo employees are just people that were
3259520	3262680	working in San Diego and got drunk and woke up in the tiger cage.
3262680	3266680	That failed zoo employees from San Diego.
3268320	3270600	I hope you're listening to Milwaukee, you fucking piece of shit.
3270600	3271600	Yeah, you fucking assholes.
3272760	3277280	The truth, the truth or the propaganda or the propaganda is that Milwaukee is very
3277280	3282160	proud of, it has a great zoo for a city of its size and a great symphony too, but I
3282200	3282640	don't know.
3282720	3287200	I think every hometown like like, like, like people are always proud of their
3287200	3287440	zoo.
3287440	3290000	I don't think, I don't think, is it?
3290000	3294280	I mean, is there any, is there any city that's like, don't be proud of a zoo or an
3294280	3297400	aquarium, they're, they're fucking, they're fucking animal jail.
3297520	3297920	Yeah.
3298240	3299200	The fucking bullshit.
3299200	3302480	Like aquariums and there's better jails than some.
3302480	3307040	Like there's, there's, it's important for jails to be, to, to, to be fucking well
3307040	3307480	tended.
3307480	3307840	Yeah.
3307840	3308120	Yeah.
3308120	3314080	Thank you for spiking my football and your end zone, which is a touchdown for me.
3314080	3314440	Right.
3314760	3315320	Yes.
3315440	3316080	Keep going.
3316120	3318600	And I, and thank you for swinging three balls.
3318640	3320240	Great baseball metaphor.
3320280	3321720	Oh, I'll swing three balls, baby.
3322560	3324040	I'm swinging at least two right now.
3324280	3328760	I do think that having been to the goddamn Los Angeles zoo, that's fucking
3328760	3335120	county jail for Milwaukee public zoo is not remember when a P 20 P one 29 or
3335120	3336600	something like Ada Koala.
3337600	3338040	What?
3338560	3339080	Okay.
3340160	3340840	Listen to this.
3340840	3342120	She's at a public school.
3342120	3343000	They need a koala.
3343520	3348720	I think it's named P one 29 is a fucking mountain mountain lion that lives in
3348720	3349640	Griffith park.
3349680	3350120	Oh yeah.
3350120	3350160	Yeah.
3350160	3350560	Right.
3351160	3351640	Yes.
3352080	3355800	And it, so my daughter, it got tired of being a number.
3355840	3356800	She was seven.
3356800	3357200	Right.
3357520	3364040	And she came home and she was like, Hey, Hey daddy, P one 29 and a koala bear.
3364400	3366600	And I was like, what's P one 29 or whatever.
3366600	3371800	And she like, it's a mountain lion and it stolen to the zoo.
3372160	3374920	And she didn't, she didn't say that.
3376280	3378560	She doesn't, she's not a poet.
3381200	3382680	Your daughter is PG Wodehouse.
3382680	3383960	I'm punching up her shit.
3384720	3385520	I'm punching her.
3386840	3388120	She needs a little punch up.
3388120	3389320	I used to be at the daily show.
3389320	3390920	Now you're doing punch up for seven.
3391120	3394600	I tell stories way better than she does.
3395920	3398160	And she's like, he patted across the maze.
3400960	3408520	And, and, uh, so anyway, the day she was asked to the koala was dashed fairly to
3408520	3415040	bits and forthwith disposed of a koala bear.
3416200	3420240	Uh, uh, yeah, the fucking mountain lion, basically what my daughter was saying is
3420240	3424280	the fucking mountain lion broke into the zoo and ate a koala the night before she
3424280	3426280	went on her field trip to the zoo.
3426640	3428520	And me and my wife were like, no way.
3429600	3432880	Uh, and yeah, wait, your daughter's filled with lies most of the time.
3434480	3438440	I'm not, I'm not going to say she's not talking about a Rick and Morty fan.
3438640	3440080	Oh, well, now that's the youngest one.
3440080	3442240	She's not allowed to watch Rick and Morty yet.
3442360	3445520	Oh wait, I thought this was a story from so long ago that your 13 year old was
3445520	3450040	said, this was my other daughter who really dying to watch Rick and Morty.
3450040	3452520	So P 128 just recently ate a koala.
3452600	3453320	Are you looking it up?
3453320	3454720	No, but I, you reminded me a thing.
3454720	3456920	I need to look up on, on, on next door app.
3456920	3459040	That's going to break every koala bear.
3459080	3461040	I mean, this is a long way of going.
3461080	3465960	The mountain lion came out of Griffith park and jumped went into the zoo, a koala
3465960	3468960	fence, ate a koala, delicious, delicious koala.
3468960	3469680	And then just boned out.
3469680	3473320	The thing about LA is they're like, well, that's nature.
3475320	3476080	Fuck yeah, it is.
3476120	3479680	Fuck yeah, it is like, like for that, for that mountain lion, a zoo is like
3479680	3480400	Trader Joe's.
3480440	3481320	Absolutely.
3481920	3483800	And all we can do is tag it.
3483960	3485000	They tagged it out.
3485000	3486720	They tagged it and they just watching it.
3486960	3489600	They're like, well, it's not going to eat more koalas, but we're not going to kill
3489600	3489800	it.
3490640	3494680	It's like, um, yeah, let it, let it prowl.
3494680	3495000	Fuck you.
3495000	3496360	Don't fuck koala park.
3496480	3497840	Just don't go into the park.
3497840	3498960	Koala is supposed to be assholes.
3498960	3501880	That's what they're supposed to be really unfriendly and like kind of koala suck.
3501920	3502280	Yeah.
3502360	3503280	Well, come on.
3503280	3504600	They don't suck as violent.
3504840	3507600	No animal deserves to be locked up.
3507640	3510760	And then like the, like the, like the, like, Hey, good day.
3510760	3511840	Here's your eucalyptus.
3511960	3512800	See you tomorrow.
3512880	3515400	It's the, it's the freshest eucalyptus from Milwaukee.
3515480	3517640	Uh, uh, wherever this fucking thing is.
3517960	3523400	And then like, uh, I do like Milwaukee eucalyptus and then like, okay, lights out.
3523480	3525160	Hey, koalas lights out.
3525640	3527680	And they're like, oh, hey, mate.
3528040	3530480	Hey, uh, you knew here, right?
3531040	3531560	Yeah.
3531640	3532000	Yeah.
3532040	3532520	Oh, sorry.
3532520	3533360	You, you, you're the other.
3533800	3534800	I'll be the new koala.
3534800	3535080	Yeah.
3535440	3536920	Uh, I don't do a very good.
3536920	3537480	I was telling you that.
3537480	3538200	Listen, here I go.
3538240	3541200	You can save me, uh, 10, 10 new keys.
3541240	3541520	Yeah.
3541560	3546000	Uh, I bet that you wouldn't be the first to cry.
3548320	3549600	Just try to suck it up.
3549840	3553360	Are you, are you trying to fuck me?
3554920	3560280	Oh, my, I'm welcoming you to like a horrible, uh, new lifestyle.
3560320	3561200	I was tough.
3561400	3562800	I was, this is no.
3563440	3565400	My, uh, my accent's doing great.
3565400	3569400	I was, but then the mountain line, the mountain line, wait, wait, wait.
3569400	3571240	Well, that's what I'm building to please.
3571240	3575800	Cause that's the fucking worst that no animal deserves this tragic irony that
3575800	3578200	it's like, Oh, just, just take it easy, mate.
3578440	3582920	Like, look, I was just going to fuck up the largest koala in here, but now
3582920	3584360	listen to you instead do that.
3584400	3591720	Just remember you're in here for keeps and you're never getting out and like
3591760	3593200	they control everything.
3593800	3597440	Um, but it beats being in the jungle.
3600800	3603280	Oh, did you, did you say something?
3603280	3604160	Wait, did you hear that?
3604160	3606320	Oh, I'm not familiar with it.
3606320	3607240	It's sand.
3607280	3609560	Wait, did you, oh, Jesus.
3609560	3610240	Oh, fuck.
3610240	3612360	There's a fucking wild animal.
3612400	3614600	Fucking man, wild animals.
3614600	3617080	Why, why can't we be there?
3617080	3619120	This is where I left the bush.
3619160	3623080	They told us when they put us in the crate, that the whole point was they
3623080	3624600	didn't have wildlife.
3626600	3627000	Hello.
3627000	3627880	I'm the mountain lion.
3627880	3628600	I'm sorry.
3628600	3633560	I stolen to your, your, your, your, I was different.
3633560	3636760	I didn't mean to steal into your, your, your habitats.
3636800	3638200	I was wrong about this fella.
3638200	3641240	I, I, I, I, I, I, I'd be mighty chuffed if I could nibble on all of you.
3641840	3645840	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's
3645840	3646680	good qua.
3647640	3650120	That's like, like, like one of those horror movies where it's like the zombie
3650120	3654400	apocalypse is happening in the, you know, if they really want to hurt your feelings,
3654400	3656680	like they'll cut to like the local jail or whatever.
3656680	3658240	And it's just like, Hey, let me out.
3658240	3660080	And it's like, God damn it.
3660560	3662320	Like, like that sucks.
3662320	3665640	Like, like they already sucked to be human into the apocalypse.
3665640	3670400	And then there's like, meanwhile, where it's illegal to have more than a pot of weed.
3670440	3672760	Yeah, I don't, I don't, I measure weed and pots.
3672760	3676520	I would say that that's, that's not very sportsman like of the, of the mountain
3676520	3678320	lion to go eat a jail.
3679040	3685520	That mountain's gonna lion, you know, but like, it's, it's not sportsman like of a
3685520	3688000	zoo to be like, here you go.
3688120	3691240	You're not allowed to do anything naturally koala ish.
3691560	3696320	No, no, no, stay exactly where you are, where I'm going to go to bed where, and then
3696320	3701120	it's just like, you stay here in this not mountain lion proof sale.
3701600	3707000	And the koalas, the koalas can't unionize and say, can we make the fence mountain lion
3707000	3710120	tall? Yeah, yeah, not coming out today.
3710120	3713240	Fuck, get face and be funny.
3713240	3714800	Now, this is able to jump out.
3714800	3716680	This is not, this is not fair dinkum.
3716840	3718240	Yeah, not fair dinkum.
3718640	3721920	Aye, oi, aye, do not like your hat, mate.
3723320	3728640	The zookeeper hat you're wearing might don't like your hat, mate.
3729720	3731520	God, you got, you got this fucking locked down.
3731520	3732840	You're fucking, you're in the zone.
3732840	3735960	Okay, so my dog's gotten a skunk battle.
3736680	3742520	So after that last week, we were celebrating the week anniversary of the front porch
3742880	3745920	massacre. Cody thought I was coming home from the show.
3746600	3752400	Like she like like she thought she was so like she thought she was timing it right.
3752400	3755360	So when the dogs started barking, she assumed it was me coming up the front walk.
3756080	3757640	She flings open the front door.
3757960	3759920	It's going to be a beautiful thing.
3760200	3764320	All the dogs coming out, Barbara, Harvey, Nigel, they're going to like run out.
3764640	3767040	We love being a family and a pack and Barbara.
3768440	3769120	It's the worst.
3771440	3772400	Barbara's great.
3772560	3773080	Go ahead.
3773160	3775560	Well, Barbara's she's great.
3775560	3776520	I won't say she's great.
3776560	3777320	She's great.
3777400	3780680	She's, I mean, I can't name a dog, but I love Barbara.
3780680	3782080	She's my, she's my daughter.
3782080	3784800	Like, she's the one I got a little much.
3786560	3792200	She said that the dogs go flying out the front door, but it's not me rolling up.
3792280	3793520	It's a it's a skunk.
3793520	3799760	And and so it's Harvey runs out and is like, what's up?
3799760	3804600	And the skunk is like, and Harvey's like, and then Barbara's like, even though Barbara
3804600	3808800	hates Harvey and constantly like nips at them when they're feeding and like, like, like,
3808800	3813240	like Barbara's like constant, like, it's just it's just ironic that this is now a time
3813240	3816760	for sibling support, that she's like, why did you spray my brother?
3816760	3820320	And like, like runs in, grabs the skunk and it's like.
3821320	3823320	And it's like spraying everything.
3823320	3829320	I got one move, one move and Nigel's like, I've been through this six times.
3829320	3830920	I think I'm supposed to hang back.
3830920	3833120	And and Cody's like, Barbara, let go.
3833120	3834120	And Barbara, let's go.
3834120	3839520	And the skunk goes by her account limping away and then looks back at Nigel, who's just
3839520	3848320	like watching it and goes because it's had enough and of this yard and just like limps
3848320	3855600	away and and Cody gets all of the pack into the fucking house, which still stinks and
3855600	3858160	it's a nightmare and all this stuff.
3858160	3865760	So then two days later, this post on Nextdoor app, because the internet doesn't let anything
3865760	3869720	happen anymore with like it.
3869720	3871640	This is we're not going to survive.
3871640	3873120	It's all content, baby.
3873120	3875120	We are all connected now.
3875120	3880520	There is no escape like and and the the bad, I think, outweighs the good of a purely connected
3880520	3883840	society like I were on the Nextdoor app.
3883840	3889600	So we saw this post injured baby skunk.
3889600	3894840	Fuck you.
3894840	3902080	I saw an injured baby skunk wild wild wild all right.
3902080	3903080	Fuck you.
3903080	3904080	Fuck you.
3904080	3905080	Fuck you.
3905080	3908280	Well, now, you know, this sounds like some Milwaukee shit right now, you know, this person's
3908280	3913720	into skunks while walking on my neighborhood at around seven p.m.
3913720	3916680	It was dragging its back legs, not limp.
3916680	3919480	It was like, oh, fuck you.
3919480	3925480	Don't mourn this skunk, possibly hit by a car.
3925480	3929680	You keep thinking that it made its way into someone's garden.
3929680	3934240	So I hurriedly got on the Internet in search of a place to help rescue it.
3934240	3938680	I called Humane Society in Glendale as it is supposed to be open 24 seven to get an
3938680	3942560	answering machine, which says we do not rescue animals call the Pasadena office.
3942560	3944360	Well, it was closed at seven p.m.
3944360	3948360	I then called around every animal rescue of friends of animals, vets, et cetera, to find
3948360	3949560	them all closed.
3949560	3953560	It's pathetic that it is so hard to find help for a sick or injured animal.
3953560	3958800	I lived in a small town in another state where there is always a place to find help without
3958800	3961280	just realizing an animal in distress.
3961280	3965240	I realize that sometimes an animal is so badly injured that it can be the only thing you
3965240	3966240	can do.
3966240	3970600	But at least we can try to save a life without taking the easy way out.
3970600	3976400	I am really disappointed that in a city as big as L.A., it's so hard to find some organization
3976400	3977400	to help.
3977400	3981440	I went back with water for the little skunk and could not find it.
3981440	3982600	And it was getting dark.
3982600	3986120	I am really angry and frustrated right now.
3986120	3987120	Send.
3987120	3988120	Send?
3988120	3992000	I don't know.
3992000	3995200	I understand all of those feelings, except for the...
3995200	3996880	I don't need to proofread this.
3996880	3997880	Let that one sit.
3997880	3998880	The skunk is not...
3998880	4002760	When she goes into the biography portion of it, I was born in a small town.
4002760	4005280	You don't picture this as a dude?
4005280	4006280	You said she.
4006280	4007560	I picture this as a dude.
4007560	4013120	It's funny how I immediately picture this as a guy, but now that I'm proud of myself
4013120	4015400	for picturing it as a guy.
4015400	4020840	But it's because I don't like them, and part of that is that I feel terrible because I'm
4020840	4021840	like...
4021840	4030520	I just think they're describing the wake of a fucking horrible war machine that...
4030520	4032800	So I want this person to be a bad person.
4032800	4033800	It's not...
4033800	4036360	This person doesn't have empathy for the little skunk.
4036360	4040560	This person's like, oh, these fucking neighbors are gonna love me after this skunk report.
4040560	4046880	I can't believe this yelp review about their relationship with doing nothing.
4046880	4048360	They accomplished nothing.
4048360	4052720	Do you have a Ring doorbell?
4052720	4053760	I got a new thing.
4053760	4056400	It's a doorbell unlocks the front door.
4056400	4057400	That's right.
4057400	4058400	There's no camera necessary.
4058400	4059400	That's right.
4059400	4060400	I'm sorry.
4060400	4065040	You ring his doorbell and he goes, come in.
4065040	4068920	Well Ring whatever has this...
4068960	4074000	I think it's kind of perfected and fucked up neighborhood, next door neighborhood, whatever
4074000	4076520	it is, because it's basically Ring...
4076520	4077520	Does anybody know about this?
4077520	4079160	Like Ring neighborhood?
4079160	4084840	So basically it's just pictures of people sneaking into their yard or like trying to
4084840	4090000	find a key on top of the door jam and then seeing there's a ring and like, oh fuck, and
4090000	4091360	they run away.
4091360	4093640	And that gets posted to Ring neighborhood.
4093640	4095560	And everybody's like, oh Jesus, that's awesome.
4095560	4101280	That's a black and white nighttime photo of this criminal.
4101280	4105400	But then also every once in a while, there's just this kid, it's like a black kid trying
4105400	4108080	to sell candy, right?
4108080	4109080	And yeah.
4109080	4110080	Right.
4110080	4114240	And people are like, oh, I have never seen this fella around the neighborhood before.
4114240	4115240	Looks like he's casing.
4115240	4116240	What's he got in that box?
4116240	4117240	Yeah.
4117240	4118240	What's he got in there?
4118240	4119240	He's casing my house.
4119480	4120480	Yeah.
4120960	4126440	It's at least nobody's like talking about their fucking little skunks.
4126440	4132600	Everybody's, you know, it's just pictures of criminals and people being mistaken.
4132600	4136200	The only, like if someone knocks on my door, I'm instantly upset.
4136200	4137200	Like I think it goes back to...
4137200	4138960	I think they're all criminals.
4138960	4140800	Anybody that knocks on my door is a criminal.
4140800	4143560	I don't care if you're UPS or whatever the fuck.
4143560	4147560	But if you knock on my door, it harkens back to the time when I was broken.
4147560	4150080	That might be the sheriff coming to evict me.
4150080	4154480	Like the mailbox and the knock on the door is always the enemy.
4154480	4157440	Even if I've ordered food and I know that someone's going to come, the knock on the
4157440	4160880	door, I instinctively look for my shoes.
4160880	4163680	Because there was a time when I literally had to like think about like going at the
4163680	4166000	back, like the back exit.
4166000	4167880	And so fuck you for knocking on doors.
4167880	4172160	But if you're going to knock on my door, have chocolate.
4172160	4175520	If the little kid comes up with the fucking box full of chocolate, it's pretty good chocolate.
4175520	4180480	They got the almonds in there and I don't care what it's for, they say they're going
4180480	4181480	to get a trip somewhere.
4181480	4182480	I don't give a fuck.
4182480	4185920	But if you're going to knock on my door, candy, bring me some goddamn chocolate with some
4185920	4186920	almonds in it.
4186920	4187920	I will always buy that.
4187920	4189680	I will buy the whole goddamn box.
4189680	4190680	Yeah.
4190680	4195800	I told the story on this podcast about like the first year in my house, like the weirdest
4195800	4197920	encounter that I still think about all the time.
4197920	4203160	And I'm like, this guy that looked so much like Kevin James, like just picture Kevin
4203160	4204160	James.
4204160	4206520	He had a baseball hat on and he just looked like Kevin James.
4206520	4207520	Just picture that.
4207520	4213760	He rang my doorbell and like he was like, hey, um, hey, I'm so and so, uh, uh, I'm such
4213760	4217320	a touch and I throw the, and he kind of like, he ran, he rattled off the stuff and I'm just
4217320	4221640	like, you know, I'm in full, I'm already, I'm just in like stranger on my porch mode.
4221640	4227000	Like I don't like, and so I'm not absorbing what he's explaining, which is that he's related
4227000	4233480	to one of my neighbors and that his mother-in-law's grandma's sister is the one that walks the
4233480	4235520	poodles from time to time.
4235520	4239320	And like, I'm just giving him this blank look cause I'm like, what's happening?
4239320	4245560	And like, it sets the tone for the whole conversation that like he sees this blank look and he,
4245560	4250360	it seems like in his mind, he's done so much explaining about who he is and I've, I've
4250360	4256000	given him nothing in return that he, he just gets this look on his face like, nevermind.
4256000	4260920	So anyways, and then he continues with this pitch about like kids in a soccer league and
4260920	4264120	they're like playing soccer and they're going to go to Italy and play soccer and all the
4264120	4267880	kids in the local school and all these things are going to play plus soccer and, and they
4267880	4270000	need money and they're raising money and they're fundraising.
4270000	4274360	And I'm like, I'm just like, like, wow, man, like if you come knock on my door, like, like
4274360	4279080	if you're lucky, if I'm high, like I like, like you're, you're unlucky if I'm like in
4279080	4282480	the middle of a movie, like, like, I don't, it's just like, you're at someone's house
4282480	4286520	and so I'm just like, I'm not, I was like, how do I, what do I do?
4286520	4287520	What do you want?
4287520	4293440	Like I reach in my pocket and I like unwat like a $5 bill and in my head I'm thinking
4293440	4295200	like Harmon, you're crazy.
4295200	4298720	This guy's a panhandler and he's like going to get five bucks.
4298720	4301800	Like if you saw him on the street, you wouldn't give a $5 bills away.
4301800	4304960	Like you're just, you're just engaging in this weird, like suburban privilege thing
4304960	4307240	because the guy's looks like Kevin James.
4307240	4312600	And while I'm thinking that the guy is looking at the $5 bill, like I'm producing an AIDS
4312600	4317440	needle and, and, and like offering a champ and, and, and, and, and I'm like, you know
4317440	4318440	what?
4318440	4321080	Well, I'll tell you what, I just, uh, I, this is what I got in my pocket right now.
4321080	4325720	I'm kind of in the middle of a probably disappointing some studio on a draft and you're probably
4325720	4331480	watching Pluto Nash and, uh, and, and he's like, he doesn't take the $5 he's, he's, he's
4331480	4332480	like, okay.
4332480	4333480	Okay.
4333480	4334480	No, no.
4334480	4336400	I mean, usually what we're talking about is something more like, like, like, like, you
4336400	4340120	know, like in the, in the neighborhood of something, if you have a checkbook or a thing
4340120	4343120	and I'm like, I just took a turn.
4343120	4344120	Yeah.
4344120	4346880	And I'm like, oh, I don't have a checkbook in the house.
4346880	4350960	And like, uh, and he's like, you know what, I, I don't, I don't, I don't, you know what,
4350960	4351960	you like, like, like, whatever.
4351960	4352960	It's not fine.
4352960	4356560	It's like, I come over here, you're pulling out like $5 out of your pocket and I was like,
4356560	4357560	I just, like, whatever.
4357560	4359400	And he like walks away.
4359400	4362680	I'm, I'm just shell shocked.
4362680	4366200	And I don't like standing there in the porch and then I'm like, and then I'm like, like,
4366200	4370000	like walk out, like as he's walking away, cause you've got to like walk down all these
4370000	4373440	like DreamWorks flagstone steps out of my place.
4373440	4375240	He can't just like disappear into a bush.
4375240	4378440	It's like, he just had this like weird thing with me.
4378440	4385000	And now I'm just walking a football field and I'm like, are you a psychopath?
4385000	4388360	What are you a fucking psycho or something?
4388360	4390160	Like I was like genuinely curious.
4390160	4391960	Like I was like, it was like, what was this?
4391960	4397240	So I can tell my friends and, and he turns around these Kevin James, he's wearing cargo
4397240	4399640	shorts, a white baseball cap.
4400080	4405880	But he does this move where he turns around while he's storming away and raises his arms
4405880	4410560	out and he goes like, I don't know, man, you know, everybody has a checkbook in their house,
4410560	4411560	sir.
4411560	4417600	And he, and then he just like walks away and I'm like, what the fuck?
4417600	4420600	That's definitely not true for me.
4420600	4422960	I'm sure it's true for everybody.
4422960	4426040	You've fucking gotten to pay for your friend's soccer.
4426040	4429200	What the fuck are you talking about?
4429200	4434040	You can't, this is the big house on the hill, baby.
4434040	4436080	I pay people to count my money.
4436080	4438320	I don't even, I might be broke right now.
4438320	4439320	That's how rich I am.
4439320	4444520	I'm not going to check, check, but oh yeah, it's right over here by my coupons.
4444520	4446920	Let me get my coupons and my checkbook.
4446920	4448960	That's fucking poor people's shit.
4448960	4453520	I'm not going to get out of pen and write about money on a, whoa, whoa, whoa, to whom
4453520	4454760	it may concern.
4454760	4456320	Can I have some been gay?
4456320	4457320	Fuck you.
4457320	4461440	I'm not going to Batman and write about money.
4461440	4462440	Yeah.
4462440	4463440	That's what a check is.
4463440	4464440	Right?
4464440	4465440	Like, Oh, here's some money.
4465440	4466440	I hope I have.
4466440	4467440	Well, signed Shirley.
4467440	4469480	Oh, what's the date again?
4469480	4470480	I don't know.
4470480	4472080	What's up on a time?
4472080	4473080	Like fuck you.
4473080	4477680	I'm like, I, I, I, when I learned about that shit in the home acting in middle school,
4477680	4482040	I'm like, okay, well how much money do you have to pay to get rid of the, no, I'm not
4482040	4483040	balancing.
4483040	4484040	No check.
4484040	4485200	I'm not keeping a diary about my money.
4485200	4489040	This is fucking Wilma Flintstone shit.
4489040	4491880	My mom, my mom, you know what, you know, I'm on a little tear here.
4491880	4494920	My mom, my mom, my mom would be like, you got to learn to tell time.
4494920	4498680	Like, I'm like, what the fucking things with the, the needles?
4498680	4499680	Like no, man.
4499680	4502840	There's a clock on the stove and she's like, that's a digital clock.
4502840	4503840	It's different.
4503840	4507200	I'm like, bitch, do you think the voice, what kind of clock do you think every is going
4507200	4509640	to be everywhere?
4509640	4511880	Bitch please.
4511880	4519000	You think people are, oh yeah, we invented the stove clock that says 8 0 3 bitch.
4519000	4522560	And you don't got to subtract any shit and multiply times five.
4522560	4527360	What is this fucking Archimedes shit on the wall with a fucking cat's eyes going, click
4527360	4528360	clock.
4528360	4531000	Do I got to work it out?
4531000	4532000	What do you think?
4532000	4533000	I don't know.
4533000	4535200	Here's a hint about what time it is.
4535200	4540120	Five times five minus 13, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
4540120	4541120	Fuck you.
4541120	4544120	I'm going to be rich in the future.
4544120	4546080	My car's going to drive itself.
4546080	4547680	I'm not even going to have to steer.
4547680	4552120	I can't believe your parents beat you.
4552120	4554040	They did it first.
4554040	4555600	Then I got surly.
4555600	4562720	I think, I don't think actually you're making me think you can call your mom bitch in the
4562720	4563720	kitchen.
4563720	4567800	You're going to get fucking, you're going to get hyperbolic.
4567800	4571320	I never called my mom bitch.
4571320	4573480	Did you really not have a checkbook in your house?
4573480	4574480	No, I didn't.
4574480	4580520	I mean, I might've had one packed away with the fucking commemorative princess dyed shot
4580520	4587560	glasses that my ex-wife bought on the, if I had checkbooks in that house, they were
4587560	4588560	like.
4588560	4589560	I have a checkbook.
4589560	4591360	It's blasted me for years, but I still have one.
4591360	4592360	Once in a while.
4592360	4593360	Hey, well, you agree with this guy.
4593360	4594360	Everybody's good.
4594360	4595360	You just got to fucking move.
4595360	4597800	I'm like, yeah, not for you, Kevin James.
4597800	4602960	It's like, you know, if you're like, let's say like you, like you loan a friend like
4602960	4606200	50 bucks or, you know, whatever, like, and you write your friend a personal check or
4606200	4609200	whoever it is, no matter what it is, the gas company, whatever you got to do to write it,
4609200	4610680	you have to write a check.
4610680	4615040	In the notes section, I think people neglect the note section and every time, no matter
4615040	4621440	who it is, business related, friendly, whatever, and the notes, erotic cakes.
4621440	4625760	I always just put drugs.
4625760	4630080	One time, David Butler, our business manager accountant who we just saw today, he said,
4630080	4635320	like, hey, Jeff, did you, did you spend $800 on erotic cakes?
4635320	4639200	And you're like, yeah, my job here is done.
4639200	4640800	Yes, I did.
4640800	4644360	That shit will get held up on Venmo or whatever it is now, right?
4644360	4649880	Like, if you put a little memo in a Venmo payment, I don't have Venmo yet, so I don't
4649880	4650880	know.
4651320	4653000	Everybody's got Venmo, man.
4653000	4657760	She paid her therapist, she wrote something funny in the therapy section, and it was like,
4657760	4662400	I think it was a reference to what she talked about in the therapy section, which also happened
4662400	4668360	to allude to, like, explosives or something, and it was like, and they held her check up
4668360	4675240	because it was, like, the memo, which as long as I've lived is always where the joke goes.
4675280	4682040	She put a joke, but now that we're in the fucking new digital world, the memo matters?
4682040	4687360	They, like, held her check because she might have been ISIS, because ISIS is, like, so
4687360	4689200	into, like, clean bookkeeping.
4689200	4692680	They're like, it's for explosives, just put the explosives.
4692680	4694360	Yeah, you know, like, signatures.
4694360	4696080	This is how Al-Qaeda failed.
4696080	4698440	It's got them on the fucking bookkeeping.
4698440	4703480	On your email, you can set a signature, just every email you send is the same signature.
4703480	4712120	On Venmo, my memo that I sent is just kill the president.
4712120	4713520	And so far, so good.
4713520	4714520	I haven't been caught yet.
4714520	4715520	I guess they don't.
4715520	4716520	Yeah.
4716520	4717520	Nobody's ringing my doorbell.
4717520	4721320	I'm not sure if it's still true, but I think David Cross, you know, when you incorporate,
4721320	4722920	you can name your corporation whatever you want.
4722920	4723920	Do you have a funny name for you?
4723920	4724920	I do.
4724920	4725920	No, I don't.
4725920	4726920	It's not funny.
4726920	4727920	It's just a name.
4727920	4728920	But I believe...
4728920	4729920	It's a Cordray company.
4729920	4733640	And David Cross is the Jew-run media.
4733640	4736960	So every time he writes himself a check from his corporation, he's being paid by the Jew-run
4736960	4737960	media.
4737960	4738960	That's really good.
4738960	4740440	I really blew it.
4740440	4741440	Really?
4741440	4742440	Yeah.
4742440	4745280	I regret my calling it just Cordray company.
4745280	4746280	Okay.
4746280	4749200	Why did it have to be a baby skunk?
4749200	4754160	By the way, what does this guy know about skunk ages?
4754160	4757480	I can't believe he came back with water.
4757480	4758480	My trainer...
4758480	4759480	How does a baby skunk...
4759480	4766120	I like that he or she surmises that it's a car accident.
4766120	4767720	Like if a baby skunk is hit by a car...
4767720	4768720	What else would you assume?
4768720	4772280	Listen, fuck skunks, fuck sharks, fuck bears, and fuck mosquitoes.
4772280	4773280	Yeah.
4773280	4775280	Let's just wipe them all off the planet.
4775280	4776280	Kill them all.
4776280	4777280	I love bears.
4777280	4778280	Probably.
4778280	4779280	But skunks are adorable.
4779280	4780280	Bears, I don't mind.
4780280	4781280	Okay.
4781280	4782280	All right.
4782280	4785680	Skunks are adorable, but they will fuck up your life if they decide to do it.
4785680	4786680	Probably a valuable party ecosystem.
4786680	4790000	A family of skunks that used to live right in my street, and once in a while, I would
4790000	4793280	just come home late at night, and there'd be a family of skunks on my doorstep, and
4793280	4794280	it's just a standoff.
4794280	4795280	Yeah.
4795280	4796280	It's like, I might...
4796280	4798800	Like, I have to go to a hotel tonight, because it's fucking...
4798800	4804240	When I used to smoke, and I would be sitting in my driveway smoking, and I'd feel like
4804240	4809040	a little tongue or a nose on the back of my shin, and I'd look down as a fucking skunk.
4809040	4810040	What?
4810040	4811880	It's like sniffing the back of my leg.
4811880	4813120	Your neighbor's feeding them.
4813120	4814120	And I would...
4814120	4815120	Yeah, probably.
4815120	4816120	That's what that means.
4816560	4818360	Jump a million years away from...
4818360	4819760	And that sprays you for jumping.
4819760	4820760	Yeah.
4820760	4821760	Right?
4821760	4824280	Oh, you talked about, in an earlier show, Coyote in your yard, right?
4824280	4825880	Yeah, they were back last night.
4825880	4826880	Really?
4826880	4827880	Yeah.
4827880	4828880	Oh, see?
4828880	4833560	So this is one of those shows where I was walking, and I was listening, and I was talking
4833560	4842440	to you through my AirPods or whatever they are, because, yeah, I can afford those, man.
4842440	4846880	And I was like, no, you've got to haze the Coyote.
4846880	4847880	Yeah.
4847880	4848880	You've got to haze them.
4848880	4849880	Otherwise, they'll die.
4849880	4850880	Yeah.
4850880	4854480	Like, nobody's going to come and get rid of that Coyote.
4854480	4855480	What do you mean, haze a Coyote?
4855480	4856480	I had a Coyote.
4856480	4861080	You've got to stand out in the cold, so they get into your fraternity?
4861080	4863720	You've got to make a jug.
4863720	4865200	They've got to butt-chug some Jack Daniels?
4865200	4868640	You've got to butt-chug some Jack.
4868640	4870680	You've got to throw rocks at them and stuff.
4870920	4874280	If you befriend the Coyote and convince it to butt-chug.
4874280	4877080	And to join my fraternity.
4877080	4881240	And then, yeah, they go through a pledging period.
4881240	4885200	And then the Coyote comes to you, it's like, I'm all strung out.
4885200	4886200	That's fun.
4886200	4892200	Brother, you've got to call me brother before you say you strung out.
4892200	4894200	Anyway, throw rocks at your coyotes.
4894200	4898040	AirPods, I want to say one thing for Christmas.
4898040	4907040	I was high enough tier on the FX gift list that I got AirPods for that.
4907040	4908040	You got gifted AirPods?
4908040	4909040	FX AirPods.
4909040	4914000	And it says FX on the little case, I'm like, wow, cool, AirPods, that's cool.
4914000	4916680	I have some of these, people make fun of you when you wear them, but whatever.
4916680	4917680	Who cares?
4917680	4923120	I opened it up and pulled them out, and they branded, you know, it said FX on the case,
4923120	4924120	and then...
4924120	4925120	You can't wear those.
4925120	4926120	On each fucking...
4926560	4927560	This is a Michael Check list.
4927560	4931040	On each little thing that sticks out of your ears.
4931040	4936040	It doesn't say FX, it just says their one word slogan, which you definitely want on
4936040	4938560	your AirPods, fearless.
4938560	4940560	Yeah, that's badass.
4940560	4945960	I just thought it was so funny, it was like, FX, you just ruined a good pair of AirPods.
4945960	4955720	Yeah, you made AirPods unwearable, like, I'm already in the crosshairs of the commoner
4955720	4956720	here, walking down the sidewalk here.
4956720	4957720	People are waiting to judge me.
4957720	4960920	It's gonna say fearless in the little cigarette butts coming out of my ears.
4960920	4961920	Yeah, no way.
4961920	4965200	Okay, so anyways, could I get a double butterscotch show?
4965200	4967360	Sir, this is an entire show.
4967360	4972040	I've got the HBO, HBO sent me something to say Chernobyl.
4972040	4975040	I wear those.
4975040	4977480	Yeah, you gotta...
4977480	4982200	I'm getting out of this house, I feel like it's trying to claim my soul, it's like infecting
4982200	4985320	my bladder, it's sending coyotes and bees.
4985760	4990720	It's sent to horrible electronics people that are making rape-friendly doorbells.
4990720	4993800	It feels like the house is saying, get out of here.
4993800	4999240	Now Barbara's eating those fucking palm pits, the dogs are puking everywhere, we gotta get
4999240	5000440	these dogs out of here.
5000440	5002000	Is your house haunted?
5002000	5007280	It's haunted by just shitty house, there's no ghost, it would be cool if there was a...
5007280	5009200	But the house is saying, get the fuck out.
5009200	5013640	It's saying, the house is saying, it's not you, it's me.
5013640	5021400	Yeah, I just keep fantasizing about the dumb shit that buys my house.
5021400	5024160	But you gotta pull the new crib, right?
5024160	5025160	Can I hang out of that pool?
5025160	5030360	I don't know, do you wanna believe I'm a pool person?
5030360	5032480	You'll never go in that pool, right?
5032480	5036320	I don't think Jeff was there for an episode.
5036320	5037320	What happened?
5037320	5038320	Yes, I don't think Jeff was there.
5038320	5039480	Yes, you can come in the pool.
5039480	5040480	I wanna hang out of the pool.
5040480	5044200	No, of course, what do you think you can get a pool for, so you don't invite your friends?
5044200	5046120	I think it's finally time at 45.
5046120	5047120	You probably go in the pools.
5047120	5050920	Oh, I'm the first one and then the last one up, baby.
5050920	5051920	You see my tan.
5051920	5052920	Oh, yeah.
5052920	5053920	Yeah.
5053920	5057120	My rich, deep Lorenzo Lamas oily tan.
5057120	5061160	Did I tell you guys about my therapist, I've been seeing a therapist?
5061160	5062160	No.
5062160	5064360	He thinks I should get a haircut.
5064360	5069000	So this is the therapist that told me to cut my beard, and now he thinks I should get a
5069000	5070000	haircut.
5070200	5071800	What the fuck is his problem?
5071800	5072800	That's the thing.
5072800	5073800	He's telling people.
5073800	5074800	You should get a therapy degree.
5074800	5075800	Yeah.
5075800	5076800	That's what I was gonna say.
5076800	5078120	I was like, yeah, you should start wearing a suit.
5078120	5079120	You should get a clipboard.
5079120	5080120	Asking people how they feel.
5080120	5081120	You should start writing things down.
5081120	5085080	I was like, you should end up saying, you should pay rent in this office.
5085080	5086080	See ya.
5086080	5087080	He runs.
5087080	5088080	You should start playing.
5088080	5091600	You should start playing highlight.
5091600	5092600	It's just very weird.
5092600	5095560	And every time I tell people about that, they're like, that sounds wrong.
5095560	5096880	And I'm like, I know, right?
5096880	5098960	Why is he weighing in on your style?
5098960	5102440	Well, he just kind of like, I go in there and he's like, so what's new?
5102440	5104160	And I'm like, oh, you know, I've been depressed.
5104160	5108800	And he's like, well, you look like shit.
5108800	5109800	Maybe get a haircut hippie.
5109800	5111960	Who do I make the check out to?
5111960	5112960	Right.
5112960	5113960	Exactly.
5113960	5114960	It's great.
5114960	5115960	It's a lot of fun.
5115960	5116960	He sounds like he's really nailing it.
5116960	5117960	It's weird.
5117960	5118960	You gotta get out of there.
5118960	5119960	Yeah.
5119960	5120960	No, I know.
5120960	5121960	Yeah.
5121960	5124640	You're allowed to see like 20 therapists before you find one you like.
5124640	5125640	Yeah.
5125640	5126640	But where do you even find one?
5126640	5127640	Well, I don't know.
5127640	5128640	You just keep going.
5129320	5130320	Just keep stumbling into him.
5130320	5132920	I want to go to a therapist to ask him about my therapist.
5132920	5136520	Like, be like, hey, he tells me to get a haircut.
5136520	5139000	What do you think about that?
5139000	5143160	It would be fair, you know, because all therapists, they see therapists, they, we learned that
5143160	5144160	in the Sopranos.
5144160	5145160	And it's true.
5145160	5150080	Like they all have therapists and, uh, uh, it, I think it would be fair, like we should
5150080	5154400	all get to have one session a month with our therapist therapist.
5154400	5155400	Yeah.
5155400	5159800	Where we're like, what's up with Linda and it's like, you don't know.
5159800	5161960	I'm like, well, she's usually asking me stuff.
5161960	5166760	I was like, uh, look, if you've ever heard her complain about her mom, let me explain
5166760	5167760	a couple of things about that.
5167760	5170920	And then you just sort of like, like put it in perspective, man.
5170920	5173120	He also said, I don't make enough eye contact.
5173120	5174200	Oh God.
5174200	5175840	I'm making more eye contact though.
5175840	5176840	It's a lot of fun.
5176840	5178760	It's like a video game.
5178760	5179760	It's like Stardew Valley.
5179760	5182800	It's like, yeah, the hearts are going up.
5182800	5187040	I feel like when I make eye contact with people, I'm going to kill them.
5187040	5189400	Like I don't want to stare into people's eyes.
5189400	5192920	That's the thing is that one time I called him on, I was like, well, do you think if
5192920	5197960	I went to another therapist, they'd tell me to get a haircut and I fucking maintained
5197960	5203040	unbroken unblinking eye contact like you're doing for like five minutes while I was watching
5203040	5204120	him answer.
5204120	5205120	I was like, right.
5205120	5208320	This is why I don't like eye contact because it's inherently aggressive.
5208320	5212600	This is what predators do to pray that they're going to murder.
5212600	5217240	Yeah, that's why I'm super comfortable doing it in this context because I want to kill
5217240	5218240	you right now.
5218240	5219240	It is true.
5219240	5222600	Yeah, humans have defenses for a reason.
5222600	5226640	Yeah, well, it's just wearing assaulted, constantly assaulted with people's eyes on
5226640	5227640	us.
5227640	5230160	I don't look at people because it's a favorite of them.
5230160	5231160	I'm right.
5231160	5232160	Exactly.
5232160	5233160	I'm like Cyclops.
5233160	5234160	I'm always like this.
5234160	5236640	I'm holding my arms in front of me like I'm like it's armor.
5236640	5237640	Right.
5237960	5244440	When I go to the therapy, I'm like this, I'm like, and he asked why I did that and I was
5244440	5248520	like, well, I don't want to close off my body posture and have you read into me closing
5248520	5249920	off my body posture.
5249920	5250920	Yeah.
5250920	5254200	So this is such a, I'm exhausted.
5254200	5260320	My therapist teaches that it's it is like, it's like eye contact and open your body up.
5260320	5265400	But like, I feel like I kind of like I kind of more like the eye contact thing I'm like,
5265840	5268920	but also I don't like looking at ugly people.
5268920	5271120	So I don't want to make eye contact.
5271120	5274560	Well, I hear that.
5274560	5275560	Like why would you want?
5275560	5276560	That's just not fun.
5276560	5277560	No, it's not fun for anyone.
5277560	5278560	Is your therapist ugly?
5278560	5279560	Oh, yeah.
5279560	5280560	All right.
5280560	5282520	It's like, why does he tell me to get there?
5282520	5283520	Say that.
5283520	5284520	Say that.
5284520	5285520	Yeah.
5285520	5286520	I'd look at you if you were hot.
5286520	5290520	When I was when I was really young, I went to a therapist with my mom was a psychiatrist.
5290520	5293600	They were giving me drugs and stuff and they were like, I noticed you have your hands
5293600	5294600	on your genitals.
5294600	5295600	You want to talk about that?
5295600	5298600	And I was like, my hands are in my lap.
5298600	5299600	Like what are you talking?
5299600	5300920	What do I do with my hands?
5300920	5303560	Oh, it's then the past 20 years.
5303560	5304560	You don't know.
5304560	5307360	I'm like, what do I do with my hands so that they're not in my lap?
5307360	5310080	So they're not on my genitals.
5310080	5311680	I can't fit them in my pockets.
5311680	5318480	I like sit like this, like I'm Jesus or something, right?
5318480	5319760	It's a lot of fun.
5319760	5322160	I think my hands are on my genitals.
5322160	5325000	Your eyes are clearly on my genitals.
5325000	5326000	Let's talk about that.
5326000	5327360	See, that would have been a good comeback.
5327360	5331040	Yeah, but yeah, I always save up a lot of good comebacks for what I'm saying.
5331040	5332040	Yeah.
5332040	5333040	It's you're on the show.
5333040	5334040	Let's breathe a scallier.
5334040	5335040	Yeah.
5335040	5336600	So you always got a good one after the therapy.
5336600	5337600	So I would.
5337600	5340680	Unless you followed that up with like, by the way, I'm overlooking all that stuff because
5340680	5343320	there's something about him or whatever that I would definitely know.
5343320	5344320	I want to.
5344320	5345320	I'm just lazy.
5345320	5346320	Yeah.
5346320	5347320	I haven't seen him lately.
5347320	5348680	85% of therapists suck.
5348680	5349680	Just like, no, I know.
5349960	5353800	My last therapist was like, I go, well, I got nothing to talk about.
5353800	5355880	And he was like, we don't have to talk.
5355880	5358840	Oh, I was like, oh, fuck.
5358840	5360840	He just starts washing a car.
5360840	5361840	Yeah.
5361840	5367600	No, he was just staring at me and I was like, all right, this is what we're doing.
5367600	5368600	Exactly.
5368600	5369600	Yeah.
5369600	5374760	So I was like, then my my mind is just I'm like, well, how long can I keep this up?
5374760	5378000	And then it becomes about keeping it up and I'm like, well, this is stupid.
5378000	5379560	I'd be here for a reason.
5379560	5383120	I want to want you to tell me why I'm so fucked up.
5383120	5384120	Yeah, exactly.
5384120	5385120	Yeah.
5385120	5386120	Oh, man.
5386120	5388000	Fix something or admit you can't and give me my money back.
5388000	5389000	Yeah.
5389000	5390000	Let's let's talk.
5390000	5391000	You talk.
5391000	5392000	What do you think?
5392000	5393000	What do you think is fucked up about you?
5393000	5394000	What?
5394000	5395000	Me?
5395000	5396000	Yeah.
5396000	5397000	Oh, take your pig.
5397000	5398000	Jesus Christ.
5398000	5399000	Dealers choice.
5399000	5400000	Damn it.
5400000	5407440	I mean, uh, uh, social awkward, awkward, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm not fucking nightmare, but
5407440	5408440	you don't.
5408440	5410520	But you, you, my mind is on fire.
5410520	5411520	Is it?
5411520	5412520	Yeah.
5412520	5415320	But I'm not thinking about anything good or intelligent.
5415320	5418940	It's just like, you fucking animal.
5418940	5422880	Is there a theme if you could identify it within that flame is like, like, I'll go first
5422880	5425900	and say, like, it's just something, it's just like, don't kick me out.
5425900	5426900	Don't kick me out.
5426900	5427900	Like, that's what I'm thinking.
5427900	5431800	Like, I'm most preoccupied by like, I'm just like, well, just like, look, look, look, uh,
5431800	5432800	don't kick me out.
5432800	5435400	Like, I just have this, like, like, don't kick me out of society.
5435400	5436400	Like, don't.
5436400	5438440	Very deeper than what my mind says to me.
5438440	5442400	My mind's always like, oh, you, you look like an asshole right now.
5442400	5446540	You just said something really stupid and that person hates you.
5446540	5449960	Now that person like, like, it sounds like you're just going, I mean, I think all this
5449960	5450960	thing stupid.
5450960	5451960	I'm just, yeah.
5451960	5457120	But then also, you know, like, who, who, what, nobody's thinking about me, right?
5457120	5459920	And what if, what would be the worst thing that would happen if they thought all of the
5459920	5464040	things, the forest thing is theoretically that they would like, they would like kick
5464040	5465800	you out, which doesn't happen.
5465800	5466800	Right?
5466800	5471400	Like, like, yeah, I guess I'm sort of thinking if, yeah, but it's all kind of like summed
5471400	5474640	up as like, like, Oh, uh, how am I driving?
5474640	5477760	Like, like, like, like you're trying to put energy into the interface.
5477760	5479800	You're going like, Hey, I hear you.
5479800	5481960	Like, like, like, like, you know, I don't know.
5481960	5484600	It's like, like, like, I want to say the right thing and all this stuff.
5484600	5489280	And it's like, and then that manifests itself as like things that might make you like awkward
5489280	5491400	or you say the wrong thing sometime.
5491400	5495520	And then I'm always thinking like, well, so in the opposite end of that spectrum, isn't
5495520	5500480	like just like a sociopath that's just like, doesn't give a fuck and is like, like, yeah,
5500480	5501680	I got this man.
5501680	5502920	Like what's this guy talking about?
5502920	5506080	I'm going to listen to everything he says, and then I'm going to like mine him for weaknesses.
5506080	5508160	I kind of jealous of sociopaths.
5508160	5509160	I know.
5509160	5510160	I totally am.
5510160	5511160	Like what?
5511160	5512160	I think everybody is like, we're fascinated with them.
5512160	5517520	Like we wish we could take like a little sociopath supplement, like do a little like, like snuff
5517520	5518520	box.
5518520	5522200	Feel like what that's like for 10 minutes or just do like a little bit to get you take
5522200	5525280	the edge off of your wanting to not get arrested.
5525280	5531620	So you're just like, I'm a little, I'm a little 5% sociopath of feeling like enough to relax
5531620	5535400	because nobody wants to talk to somebody that's thinking about how they're being received.
5535400	5539720	It's like, we're all a bunch of suction cups trying to suck on each other.
5539720	5540720	Yeah.
5540720	5543720	And that sucks.
5543720	5556240	That's how, uh, that's how humans laugh.
5556240	5560680	I hate, I hate that the guys like, Oh, I've got like, like, Oh, what do I notice that
5560680	5563320	your hair, I know that's the thing that pisses me off.
5563320	5565120	It's like, well, this isn't working.
5565120	5567520	You're not working very hard to get these answers.
5567520	5570440	The most superficial thing you could possibly say.
5570440	5572920	He was probably after he said that, like, Oh fuck.
5572920	5573920	I fucked up.
5573920	5580440	And then he goes to therapy and he's like, I said the worst thing I got, I got this bag
5580440	5581680	of dirt coming to see me.
5581680	5582680	He's got long hair.
5582680	5585000	I just want to get a book with a beard.
5585000	5586000	What are we doing?
5586000	5587000	We want somebody to get a haircut.
5587000	5589040	We don't say it.
5589040	5592480	We try to point them in the direction where they'll realize they want to get a haircut.
5592480	5593480	That's right.
5593480	5597000	Now go in the corner and piss your pants on purpose.
5597000	5601120	Oh, Clive, do it.
5601120	5604840	And then that guy goes to his therapist and it's like, like, just fucking like, it's
5604840	5609920	just a fucking dominatrix, like putting clamps on his nipples, fucking eat my cum, you little
5609920	5610920	sheep.
5610920	5613320	And he's like, no, I'm sorry.
5613320	5623880	And then she goes to a therapist and it's just like a weird, like wicker man.
5623880	5625760	We're all being led by a lunatic.
5625760	5629240	That's the thing we should be thinking about when you hear every therapist has a therapist.
5629240	5630240	Oh shit.
5630240	5635640	Is there some shrink on the moon, like making us all crazy?
5635640	5636640	There's a Lestat therapist.
5636640	5637640	It's God.
5637640	5638640	It's a God.
5638640	5641480	Talk about, I'd like therapy.
5641480	5643520	And then they're all just disseminating.
5643520	5647560	Rob, you seem like an eye contact kind of guy.
5647560	5650600	You always look me straight in the face.
5650600	5651600	Is it hard for you?
5651600	5652600	Is it difficult?
5652600	5653600	No, I'm okay with that.
5653600	5656120	But now that you mention it, I'm looking away from you.
5656120	5657120	Right.
5657120	5659600	I don't like talking about eye contact.
5659960	5660960	Yeah.
5660960	5661960	It's a weird thing to think about.
5661960	5666040	I don't mind looking at people's eyes that aren't looking at mine.
5666040	5667040	But here we go.
5667040	5670040	No, I don't like it right now.
5670040	5672040	That feels a little healthy though, right?
5672040	5673040	What?
5673040	5675120	Just allow ourselves to do this?
5675120	5676120	I love you.
5676120	5677120	I love you.
5677120	5678120	I respect you.
5678120	5679120	I love you and I respect you.
5679120	5680120	I'm in the moment.
5680120	5681120	I'm mirroring you.
5681120	5682120	Yeah.
5682120	5683640	For real though, we're not deflecting with comedy.
5683640	5684640	I really like you.
5684640	5687400	I'm so happy that you decided to come on the show.
5687400	5688680	You contacted me.
5688760	5691000	I have a lot of shame and I'm talking about myself.
5691000	5693360	I like you.
5693360	5694360	I like you.
5694360	5696320	And I'm not making a joke either.
5696320	5700600	I'm actually responding that the reason that I contacted you to come on the show is because
5700600	5706800	I love this show and I love you and I really look up to you and I respect you.
5706800	5707800	Yay.
5707800	5711920	You want to both look at Jeff?
5711920	5712920	Both look at Jeff?
5712920	5713920	Okay.
5713920	5714920	Here we go.
5714920	5715920	Hey Jeff.
5715920	5717720	He doesn't care.
5717720	5718720	Not an asshole.
5718720	5726960	No, so you're making me feel like I'm a psychopath because I'm a big eye contact person.
5726960	5728240	I love looking at people's eyeballs.
5728240	5730760	I think society wants you to have eye contact.
5730760	5733280	I think it's like something we've created.
5733280	5734640	Like we've made that a thing.
5734640	5737520	I don't think like humans naturally want to make eye contact.
5737520	5740680	I think it's something that culture has like accepted.
5740680	5743640	You know, I travel around doing shows and stuff and I like to go out and wander and
5743640	5746640	walk and I'm very fascinated by strangers.
5746720	5752960	I like meeting people and if you walk up the road in certain, like in New York City, people
5752960	5753960	make eye contact.
5753960	5758800	Like you can be on a subway and people look at you and various kinds of reactions.
5758800	5759800	People flirt.
5759800	5764360	But then you go like strangely like Seattle, nobody makes eye contact there.
5764360	5769160	I noticed like towns, there's some cultures where just zero eye contact.
5769160	5770160	Milwaukee.
5770160	5771160	Milwaukee, yeah.
5771160	5772160	Fucking Milwaukee.
5772160	5775680	I think that most people don't even know what's going on.
5775680	5781720	And most people, like because that felt good, I guess, but we looked at each other and we
5781720	5783520	were honest with each other when we were in the moment.
5783520	5788040	And then I think like, then like worse people than us, it was kind of like, you should do
5788040	5789040	that all the time.
5789040	5791800	You should do that all the time, bro.
5791800	5792960	Eat broccoli and do that.
5792960	5796560	And it's just like, well, that's because if you did it all the time, like the most you
5796560	5799040	could, like you'd feel like this much.
5799040	5800040	Jesus.
5800040	5803560	And if I, every time I saw you, you'd be like, oh, here comes Rob Cordray again.
5803560	5805800	He's going to look at me right in the eyes and tell me how much he loves me.
5805800	5808360	I don't think people could handle how much I feel.
5808360	5812280	And I think more importantly, I think you and I could, but we'd be like, I love you.
5812280	5813280	I love you.
5813280	5814280	Oh, it's great.
5814280	5815400	I like, I really respect you and all this stuff.
5815400	5819240	And I think people, I think then people around us would be like, look at these two fucking
5819240	5820240	jerks.
5820240	5821240	Yes.
5821240	5822240	Like, what are they doing?
5822240	5823440	I said, what kind of latte do you want?
5823440	5827720	Hey, you're like, like, why do you guys get a like fucking, they would make fun of us.
5827720	5830360	We'd be having that this conversation and they're inappropriate.
5830360	5831880	We'd be in like a Starbucks.
5832600	5836840	We shouldn't have it at a show in front of a hundred people.
5836840	5837840	Yeah.
5837840	5841840	I thought ostensibly you're supposed to just constantly be looking at everybody into their
5841840	5842840	goddamn souls.
5842840	5847480	I'm like, I don't really like, we did that tour and like, I met like a thousand people
5847480	5848480	a night.
5848480	5849480	Like, uh, okay.
5849480	5850480	I'm flattering myself.
5850480	5854400	There's like 200 people a night, but like people standing like a vast majority of my
5854400	5860120	audience is like, like, is like, are they going to stare at something else at the height
5860120	5861520	of their effusiveness?
5862160	5863640	They're really expressing themselves.
5863640	5867760	I look at that as like, they're taking that part of their enterprise down so that they
5867760	5868760	can divert.
5868760	5869760	So they could tell you.
5869760	5873520	Because it's time to be honest and who wants to like look into someone's eyes while you
5873520	5878320	have something really important to say, like, it's like, like, like, like that's so distracting.
5878320	5883340	Like I don't mind if you can do it fine, but like maybe some people are like, like distracted
5883340	5886520	by eye contact and then they're like, they're not able to find their word.
5886520	5888000	And then they're not able to be honest.
5888000	5889000	Yeah.
5889000	5890000	Yeah.
5890000	5894520	And so my experience is that men are really, really uncomfortable looking at their men
5894520	5896720	in the face.
5896720	5901440	And like, if you like meet somebody and like you say, oh, hi, nice to meet you.
5901440	5902840	And you look them in the eye.
5902840	5906560	It's pretty rare to meet somebody that really just looks you right in the eye and goes,
5906560	5912440	hey, hey, like I'm so and so and, and mostly instantly they look at the ground or start
5912440	5913440	doing it.
5913440	5914440	I'm going to start looking at everybody.
5914880	5915880	Yeah.
5915880	5916880	It's like a video game.
5916880	5922960	Dale Carnegie, like being tasteful with your, I looked at five people and it's like fucking
5922960	5923960	insane.
5923960	5924960	Like what?
5924960	5926360	I just did it with like five people.
5926360	5927360	You just made eye contact.
5927360	5928360	Yeah.
5928360	5929360	You got to go.
5929360	5930360	Yeah.
5930360	5931360	No, he, he, he came right here.
5931360	5932360	Can't even handle it.
5932360	5935320	Who, who in the crowd right now is, is the worst at eye contact?
5935320	5936720	Is anybody here like this terrible?
5936720	5939240	No, you've been, you've been, he's been making it.
5939240	5942640	I feel like we've had a nice relationship.
5942640	5943640	Silence seduction.
5943640	5949080	I feel like we've, no, we've like, I feel like I like this guy, Harper, Harper, the
5949080	5950080	beer.
5950080	5951080	No, that's hard.
5951080	5952080	A lot of eye contact.
5952080	5953080	Right.
5953080	5954080	Enough.
5954080	5955080	Hey.
5955080	5957840	Well, now we're talking about it.
5957840	5958840	We fucked it up.
5958840	5959840	Right.
5959840	5960840	Right.
5960840	5961840	You don't like talking about eye contact?
5961840	5962840	No.
5962840	5963840	It's like, wait, why do we have to?
5963840	5964840	I guess.
5964840	5965840	Yeah.
5965840	5966840	I'm sorry.
5966840	5967840	I told you about the therapist.
5967840	5970920	I had that she was like, uh, uh, she, she, he could tell that it was like, oh, she's
5970920	5973000	looking at me as some kind of like, sorry.
5973360	5974360	Sorry.
5974360	5976360	I just looked at, uh, I just sent lasers into Harper.
5976360	5977360	Go ahead.
5977360	5978360	Yeah.
5978360	5982520	Harper almost fainted by the way.
5982520	5983520	Yeah.
5983520	5984520	Oh fuck.
5984520	5990280	Oh, uh, this is completely off topic, but there's this guy that DM'd me saying he could
5990280	5993480	get me a free bird scooter and Matthew McGinnis.
5993480	5998840	If you're listening, give me a free bird scooter with like your own dedicated bird scooter.
5998840	5999840	Yeah.
5999840	6000840	Yeah.
6000840	6001840	Sorry, everybody.
6002000	6005840	When you said this is going to be off topic, I have a question about your free bird scooter.
6005840	6008720	Let's say, let's say Matthew comes through on that and you have your bird scooter and
6008720	6012000	you, you take it down to the market and you put it outside.
6012000	6014280	Is someone going to go and try to get on your bird scooter?
6014280	6015280	I think so.
6015280	6016280	It like locks you out.
6016280	6018040	I got, I can't get over it.
6018040	6022680	You have, you have tried to interface with a special VIP bird scooter.
6022680	6023680	Yeah.
6023680	6026600	I don't know how that works because they do, they're making ones that you can like buy
6026600	6029620	or rent to own or something that are like more personal use.
6029620	6031800	But that's my question is, how does that, how does that work?
6031800	6035160	Work in a world where everyone thinks you could just take them and run.
6035160	6037280	You just got to put numbers or chevrons on them.
6037280	6038280	Right.
6038280	6042240	I tried to convince my wife the other night.
6042240	6045880	I was like, Hey, let's go out and try and find some scooters and ride around on these
6045880	6046880	scooters.
6046880	6047880	And she was like, absolutely not.
6047880	6049880	Oh, I was like, come on.
6049880	6050880	Never.
6050880	6051880	I like that.
6051880	6052880	They're fun.
6052880	6055520	I want to do the tiered scooter system because then they can, because like they have curfews
6055520	6059280	like all of them shut off at 1130, but then they can have the rich people's ones stay
6060280	6061280	until 1215.
6061280	6062280	And that's the red hour.
6062280	6068240	And it's just like, the rich, the rich people with their carnival masks going through the
6068240	6069240	town.
6069240	6078000	You got to be like, dog town, like, like getting fucking like surfing the pavement.
6078000	6081160	You look like you're walking along a great way.
6081160	6089120	All these noblemen circling a lone milkmaid, like scooter, you have to dress up all super
6089120	6090120	like eyes wide shut.
6090120	6091120	Yeah.
6091120	6097080	Everybody's wearing two colored tights, like in the seventies, Romeo and Julia, it's like,
6097080	6102080	I bite my thumb at you, I bite my thumb at you.
6102080	6107240	The thing is like, I see people on them and like when there's a dude because I wear suits
6107240	6111000	and I'm tall and I see tall guys in suits like going around town.
6111000	6112000	Oh yeah.
6112000	6113000	That is a bummer.
6113000	6114000	And you look like a fucking nog.
6114000	6116340	A lot of people look like shit.
6116340	6121420	If you fucking see me going down the road in a fucking e-scooter, just shoot me with
6121420	6122420	a fucking shower.
6122420	6123420	I would be so proud of you.
6123420	6124420	Huh?
6124420	6125420	I would be proud of you.
6125420	6126420	No.
6126420	6127420	No.
6127420	6130380	I would be like, that's Jeff Davis in a suit.
6130380	6131380	Just walk.
6131380	6132380	Walk.
6132380	6133380	It's slow.
6133380	6134380	Walk in a scooter.
6134380	6136700	When you're wearing a scooter, you want to walk though.
6136700	6137700	They're fun.
6137700	6141460	Your shoes are made to hit the ... I want to maximize the time that I'm fucking looking
6141460	6142460	good going down the road.
6142460	6143460	Yeah, man.
6143460	6144460	You look fantastic.
6144460	6145460	I don't got to be somewhere that much that I got to look like a fucking ...
6145460	6149780	But he's maximizing the amount of people who could see him per unit time.
6149780	6150780	Exactly.
6150780	6151780	Thank you Spencer.
6151780	6152780	No, no.
6152780	6156220	The guy on the scooter, because he's making it ... You're only walking like half a mile.
6156220	6157700	This guy, he's gone three miles.
6157700	6159260	He's seen three miles of traffic.
6159260	6160540	But you're only getting so much of it.
6160540	6162580	You're only getting a glimpse of me on the scooter.
6162580	6164540	Oh yeah, but what a glimpse.
6164540	6165540	He's zipping down.
6165540	6168820	Yeah, but he's flashed up, he's dressed to the nines.
6168820	6172900	I would rather see me walking across the crosswalk than zipping across the crosswalk.
6172900	6173900	Sure.
6173900	6174900	Fuck yeah.
6175340	6180580	I want to let me wash all over your eyeballs.
6180580	6184420	But all I'm taking over my eyeballs, I'm like, why can't that guy ... Doesn't that guy have
6184420	6185420	a credit card?
6185420	6186420	Like, why can't he get a scooter?
6186420	6187420	Oh yeah.
6187420	6188420	Look at the guy.
6188420	6189420	He's got a tie bar.
6189420	6190420	He's got a pocket square.
6190420	6191420	He looks fantastic.
6191420	6192420	I got a fucking checkbook.
6192420	6193420	It doesn't work on scooters.
6193420	6194420	You son of a bitch.
6194420	6200140	I'll fucking ... If they make any scooter that takes checks, I'll fucking do it.
6200140	6201140	Shit.
6201140	6202140	City bank.
6202380	6206740	Allow me to make an introduction between you and Lo's hardware.
6206740	6211580	I'm Daphne, and intend to use this shovel for an interim.
6211580	6217100	In the meantime, could my income speak for itself?
6217100	6221980	Trust you to take the necessary ... Memo erotic cakes.
6221980	6222980	Yeah.
6222980	6223980	I'm sorry.
6223980	6227140	I've got another called e-kicks.
6227140	6228140	E-kicks.
6228140	6232020	God, I got a P. Go pee.
6232900	6233900	Go take a break.
6233900	6234900	He's almost done.
6234900	6235900	He's almost down.
6235900	6236900	It's like, how long can this show?
6236900	6237900	I know.
6237900	6238900	I don't want to go pee and then come back.
6238900	6239900	That'll be stupid.
6239900	6240900	That would suck.
6240900	6241900	Yeah.
6241900	6242900	That would be stupid.
6242900	6248980	I'll go backstage and you pee, but I'm going to make eye contact with you.
6248980	6253100	I've never heard anything more nightmarish than that.
6253100	6255140	I'm really worried at the Rick and Worthy office.
6255140	6259820	There's one urinal, and I worry that ... Because I'm on this painkiller medication that makes
6259820	6262340	your pee dark orange.
6262340	6264220	I'll take that.
6264220	6270820	Almost red, pumpkin orange, sci-fi, weird.
6270820	6277420	I worry about ... Guys don't get as many UT highs, and I'm in the men's room and it's
6277420	6282740	like, you're out of urinal, and there's a straight Mrs. Robinson shot between my legs.
6282740	6284780	If you see the boss peeing and you just ...
6284780	6292540	Does he know that it's not supposed to be that color?
6292540	6296700	Because I had to learn ... They're going to respect you less?
6296700	6297700	I don't understand.
6297700	6300380	I don't want him worrying about me.
6300380	6301380	Yeah.
6301380	6302380	I don't respect me less.
6302380	6304380	That's why shit harmony is in here.
6304380	6306300	Nobody ... Who examines the neighbor pee?
6306300	6307300	Yeah.
6307300	6308300	You flush.
6308300	6310900	I think it might catch your eye against white porcelain.
6310900	6311900	It does glow.
6311900	6313660	It's the wrong color entirely.
6313660	6314660	These are flush-less.
6314660	6315660	No.
6315660	6316660	No, they are.
6316660	6317660	He's talking about midstream.
6317660	6319660	I'm saying, there's traffic behind me.
6319660	6320860	Here I am peeing.
6320860	6324700	You can see between my legs and you see ... It's like, I think the color would catch your
6324700	6327380	eye and you'd be like, God damn.
6327380	6328380	That dude loves Amstel.
6328380	6329380	That'd be weird.
6329380	6337980	I just don't want them talking in the non-break room and being like, dude, that guy needs
6337980	6340580	to hydrate.
6340580	6345300	What if you close your legs so there's no gap in there, you know?
6345300	6347580	Yeah.
6347580	6348900	That'll make it easier to pee.
6348900	6349900	All right.
6349900	6350900	I don't know.
6350900	6351900	I'm just a solutions man.
6351900	6352900	I don't know why you're peeing.
6352900	6353900	I don't know why you're peeing.
6353900	6354900	That's the thing.
6354900	6357100	You can go into the sit-down stall and pee in the private suit.
6357100	6358100	That's what I do.
6358100	6359100	Do that.
6359100	6360100	Don't worry about the urinal.
6360100	6361780	It's so luxurious to sit while peeing.
6361780	6362780	Holy shit.
6362780	6364980	At home, I'm a sit-down peer.
6364980	6367300	I've been standing all day, motherfucker.
6367300	6368500	That was really brave.
6368500	6371940	Because I'm tall, and it eliminates the splashback.
6371940	6375860	My penis is too small for a sit-down peeing to be enjoyable.
6375860	6376860	Say what?
6376860	6380020	Well, Jeff, I didn't hear you say it.
6380020	6381460	Come again?
6381460	6389820	My penis is too small for a sit-down peeing to be like a vacation from stand-up peeing.
6389820	6391860	It's not like I'm like, oh, I hate sit-down peeing.
6391860	6398020	It's just like when you have a smaller grower, not a shower, and it's like tucked between
6398020	6400220	your legs, and it's like, is it?
6400220	6407860	It's not, unless for some reason you'd be semi-tumessant, it's not necessarily pointed
6407860	6409780	straight down at the water.
6409780	6418100	It can be like pointing 45 degrees right at the crack between the seat and the thing.
6418100	6422220	There have been times when I've just been like, I got to poop and also pee, but I'll
6422220	6423780	just do them both at the same time.
6423780	6426580	Sometimes you pee on your butt of the shorts.
6426580	6427580	What the fuck?
6428140	6433100	Oh, shit, I'm peeing in between the crack of the toilet seat.
6433100	6439580	It's like going out of the, and I'm like, oh, it's because your dick's small.
6439580	6443060	You can't complain about this on your podcast.
6443060	6444620	No true man will understand.
6444620	6447100	Jeff has the opposite problem.
6447100	6449020	His dick like falls into the water.
6453020	6454020	I mean, big deal.
6454020	6455020	Might be a worse problem.
6455020	6456020	It's gross.
6456460	6457460	Yeah.
6457460	6459460	I'm the one with the UTI.
6461460	6463460	I'm the one with the UTI.
6463460	6465460	You're snuffalificus dragging you in.
6465460	6469460	You should have banana peels in that shit.
6469460	6471460	I should be the safest.
6471460	6474460	That should be my only advantage, Darwinian.
6474460	6476460	This dick wears a suit.
6476460	6479460	I have a fucking shield around.
6479460	6481460	Is that a nipple?
6481460	6482460	No, it's a dick.
6482460	6484460	I mean, if you get me excited, I'm wing.
6484900	6486900	My dick will write a check.
6486900	6488900	But you're asking.
6488900	6490900	D cakes.
6490900	6492900	I said D cakes.
6492900	6494900	Oh, like erotic cakes.
6494900	6495900	Thank you.
6495900	6497900	Come on, man.
6497900	6498900	All right.
6498900	6503900	Well, there's only, you know, there was a, there was a, there was a, there was a D and D recap, but that's, yeah.
6503900	6510900	Well, we should hold it until we actually play because then it'll be like relevant, you know, I cut a recap in, in audio.
6510900	6511900	Oh boy.
6511900	6513900	It's so fun when we use it one of these days.
6513900	6514900	What do you mean?
6514900	6516900	You have an audio recap that you'll play for us?
6516900	6523900	So traditionally, Jeff plays a music and I go like last time on Harmon time or whatever the fuck.
6523900	6525900	And then I like explain stuff.
6525900	6528900	So instead I cut it out of audio.
6528900	6531900	So instead of me explaining it, Dan's like, what are we doing?
6531900	6533900	And Jeff's like, I think we should do the thing.
6533900	6535900	And Steve's like, I don't know you guys.
6535900	6537900	And I'm like, goblin jumps out.
6537900	6545900	And so like, you know, maybe it's more like a TV recap or something that that's only given you relevant bits rather than me just like coming up with it on fly.
6545900	6546900	I mean, I'm good at that too.
6546900	6549900	How do we, how do we physically do that here in the space?
6549900	6553900	Well, we have a sound system that can play music and all sorts of fun.
6553900	6555900	Our audio guy, Chris Boroff is here.
6555900	6557900	Yeah.
6557900	6562900	Now with video capability, he's overqualified.
6562900	6564900	I mean, that's a perfect way for him to leave.
6564900	6565900	It's true.
6565900	6566900	I got to take the L on that.
6566900	6568900	I got to take the L as the kids say.
6568900	6571900	Dad, you forgot I also do video.
6571900	6572900	All right.
6572900	6574900	You deserve a better baseball medal.
6574900	6575900	Go to the game grumps.
6575900	6576900	It's beautiful that he's going to the game grumps.
6576900	6577900	I love those guys.
6577900	6578900	They're great.
6578900	6582900	And I love that they're like still successful and like fucking showering people with money.
6582900	6583900	That's great.
6583900	6584900	I'm proud of them.
6584900	6589900	After what I put them through, played the cat in the hat game with them.
6589900	6593900	Shouldn't have done that to them.
6593900	6595900	Those are good kids, the game grumps.
6595900	6596900	I love them.
6596900	6597900	Yeah.
6597900	6598900	Yeah.
6598900	6601900	You ever go over there and play video games at the game grumps?
6601900	6602900	I don't know what you're talking about.
6602900	6603900	It's fun.
6603900	6605900	We should hook you guys up.
6605900	6607900	Chris, make Rob Cordry go on the game grumps.
6607900	6608900	Oh, man.
6608900	6609900	You'd be great on the game.
6609900	6610900	I'll go.
6610900	6611900	Yeah.
6611900	6612900	Chris would all right.
6612900	6615900	Do you have like a video game that you're upset, kind of like have a relationship with
6615900	6617900	emotionally, like bad or good?
6617900	6618900	It's like cat in the hat.
6618900	6620900	I'm not very, I'm afraid of video games.
6621900	6625900	I feel like an idiot when I play them because I can't do it.
6625900	6629900	That's part of the fun on game grumps.
6629900	6631900	I don't understand what it is.
6631900	6632900	It's fine.
6635900	6636900	Why are they grumps?
6636900	6637900	Why are they grumps?
6637900	6640900	Because they're a bit ornery and it's kind of fun.
6640900	6641900	I want to do it.
6641900	6643900	What is this game grumps?
6643900	6648900	I'm sure it starts with like, you know, one guy going like, I hate this game, like, you
6648900	6651900	know, and being good at showing you why you hate the game.
6651900	6652900	Oh, game grumps.
6652900	6654900	And now it's like cut to.
6654900	6656900	Now I get it.
6656900	6658900	Now I get it.
6658900	6660900	I want to play Stratego now.
6660900	6666900	Why don't we all get together just the four of us and play some Stratego, but like loads
6666900	6667900	of eye contact.
6667900	6669900	We can do it in my pool on Wednesday.
6669900	6670900	In your pool?
6670900	6673900	If you get a waterproof Stratego, then we're fucking talking.
6673900	6675900	That could be the worst.
6675900	6676900	All right.
6676900	6677900	I'm not going in that pool.
6677900	6679900	Well, Rob Corddry's new book is coming out.
6679900	6680900	Yes.
6680900	6683900	It's a four hour neg week.
6683900	6684900	It's about dating.
6684900	6685900	That's right.
6685900	6687900	You only have to neg women for four hours a week.
6687900	6688900	That's right.
6688900	6694900	It's in the self-help slash philosophy slash, I don't know, section.
6694900	6698900	If you wrote a book, would it be prose or would it be nonfiction fiction?
6698900	6699900	Have you written a book, by the way?
6699900	6700900	No.
6700900	6701900	No.
6701900	6703900	I've always wanted to write a book.
6703900	6704900	You got to do it.
6704900	6708900	I guess.
6708900	6713900	I feel like that is the, for some reason, that's the measure of success.
6713900	6714900	I feel the same way.
6714900	6716900	I'm too lazy to get off my ass.
6716900	6717900	Yeah.
6717900	6718900	I don't know how to do it.
6718900	6719900	I don't know where to even begin.
6719900	6721900	People that have books published, I'm so envious of it.
6721900	6722900	I'll tell you, I'm more successful than that.
6722900	6726900	You get a book deal and then you like give the money back.
6726900	6728900	But having a book deal feels like the most...
6728900	6730900	So you just said fuck it and gave them the money back?
6730900	6732900	Yeah, but first I spent it.
6733900	6737900	Part of it was like, oh shit, I'm not writing your book, am I?
6737900	6741900	And they're like, yeah, come on, we gave you money.
6741900	6745900	And then I gave money to a person that was helping me write my book.
6745900	6751900	So I truly, it was like, not only did I get paid to write a book,
6751900	6753900	I paid to write a book.
6753900	6755900	I paid to not write a book.
6755900	6757900	That's the fucking trick.
6757900	6758900	That's top tier.
6758900	6759900	That's the trick.
6759900	6761900	Donald Trump got paid to write a book.
6761900	6763900	Then somebody else paid to write a book.
6763900	6766900	I paid to not write a book.
6766900	6767900	You got paid.
6767900	6769900	I'm like Omnihotep.
6770900	6771900	Omnihotep.
6771900	6772900	I'm like, no, leave me out of it.
6772900	6773900	That's the gig right there.
6773900	6775900	I'm like, what's his name?
6775900	6777900	Old penguin guy.
6777900	6778900	Danny DeVito?
6778900	6780900	Dick Cheney, Dick Cheney.
6780900	6783900	I'm like, keep me out of it, keep me out of here.
6784900	6791900	The mark of success is staying in between the lines of history.
6795900	6797900	I just want to...
6797900	6798900	Yeah.
6798900	6800900	I wasn't going to write a good book.
6800900	6803900	It was going to be a shitty book.
6803900	6805900	So I gave the money back.
6805900	6806900	How much?
6806900	6807900	It was a lot.
6807900	6809900	It was like 200 grand.
6809900	6811900	So you spent it and then paid them.
6812900	6814900	No, you didn't write them a check.
6814900	6815900	I had to give it back.
6815900	6816900	I can't remember what the details are.
6816900	6817900	You had to give it back.
6817900	6819900	It cost me a ton of money.
6819900	6820900	I was like, oh, God damn.
6820900	6822900	I ended up eating a fucking bunch of money.
6822900	6824900	And I was like, worth it.
6824900	6827900	It was giving me so much anxiety because I was like, I don't want to write a bad book.
6827900	6831900	I do want to write a book, but I want to write a book about writing.
6831900	6835900	I just want to write a book about the craft.
6835900	6838900	That sounds obnoxious, but I don't want to write a book about it.
6838900	6839900	Well, I was in Milwaukee.
6839900	6841900	I smoked a lot of pot.
6841900	6844900	The time has gone for that.
6844900	6847900	I think you should do some young adult crime stuff.
6847900	6848900	Ooh.
6848900	6851900	I think you should write a book about not writing a book.
6851900	6854900	That sounds like a great story.
6854900	6856900	We can all write books now.
6856900	6857900	Oh, yeah.
6857900	6859900	We don't really need publishers.
6859900	6861900	No offense to them.
6861900	6863900	You could self-publish on Amazon.
6863900	6864900	I guess, yeah.
6864900	6867900	You could just write a book.
6867900	6870900	But it's not going to hit your metric of like, I did it.
6870900	6871900	Yeah, right.
6871900	6872900	Not at all.
6872900	6873900	It doesn't satisfy that.
6873900	6877900	That's why I'm a genius because I'm like, double day gave me the money.
6877900	6880900	They would have published a shitty book.
6880900	6882900	So I did it.
6882900	6883900	Yes.
6883900	6884900	Here's your money back.
6884900	6887900	Here's some more money for letting me have that experience.
6887900	6889900	No shitty book.
6889900	6892900	And now I can self-publish a book any time I want.
6892900	6896900	And if I sell it for a dollar a copy, I could make a million dollars because a
6896900	6899900	million people will be like, I got to see that card.
6899900	6900900	I got it.
6900900	6901900	Now you're setting it up.
6901900	6903900	Like you've got, I got to see that book.
6903900	6908900	I'm going to put a coupon in each dollar book that you get $10 if you don't tell,
6908900	6911900	if you don't give 10 people a free copy of the book.
6911900	6913900	You get $10 if you don't read it.
6913900	6914900	Yeah.
6914900	6915900	Something like that.
6915900	6916900	All right.
6916900	6917900	Cliffhanger.
6917900	6918900	Thank you for coming to Harbison.
6918900	6919900	Thank you.
6919900	6920900	That's our time.
6920900	6921900	Rob Cordry, everybody.
6921900	6922900	Rob Cordry.
6922900	6923900	Thank you, Rob.
6923900	6924900	Thank you, guys.
6924900	6925900	That was fun.
6926900	6929900	And let's give it up one more time for Chris Borra for all the work he's done.
6930900	6931900	In all media.
6931900	6935900	Video, audio, all senses.
6935900	6936900	Paper Mache.
6936900	6937900	Don't let the new guy.
6937900	6942900	Thank you, Zach, Nolan, and church, and Brendan, and everybody here at the Dynasty typewriter.
6942900	6945900	Spencer Crittenden is your game master.
6945900	6947900	I'm your comptroller, Jeff Davis.
6947900	6948900	Your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6948900	6949900	Thank you all for coming.
6950900	6953900	Drive fast and take chances, won't you?
6956900	6973900	Did you get any of that?
6973900	6976900	It's a good show.
