0	10000	Yeah! Make some noise! It's so good to see you!
10000	16000	Lovely Dynasty typewriter theater in downtown Los Angeles. How do you feel tonight?
16000	25000	You look so much better than that. Please welcome to the stage Spencer Crittenden!
25000	34000	Yeah! He brought that backpack for you. He got a backpack full of emotion for you.
34000	39000	Oh damn. Hopefully laughter's not an emotion.
39000	41000	Not when you hyphenated like that.
41000	44000	Damn.
47000	51000	Are you all ready for your headliner here at Shuckle Fuck?
51000	53000	Yeah!
53000	64000	Please welcome to the stage the mayor of Hormontown. He gets down, Dan Harmon!
64000	69000	Thank you. Thank you very much.
69000	72000	Well, we have so much to do. So much to do.
72000	77000	I was listening to the Pete Holmes episode from last week and there were so many things.
77000	80000	I was like, first of all, Dan, you drink too much and you interrupt too much.
80000	85000	Like fun people that have lots to say talk. I hate listening to myself interrupt people.
85000	93000	But Pete Holmes said there were so many interesting little touch points, little things he said.
93000	94000	Gems!
94000	101000	Hate is a lack of imagination. It has stuck with me for a week. There were a couple other ones.
101000	106000	Now I'm too drunk to remember. But really fun episode. So glad Pete came out.
106000	110000	Let's all hope he has something to plug again so he comes by.
110000	116000	But I have a new friend for you guys to meet that I'm deeply excited about.
116000	119000	Which could be bad or good. I don't know.
119000	125000	Here's the thing. This is the last episode before 2019, I believe.
125000	126000	What?
126000	127000	Oh, I know.
127000	128000	Yeah.
128000	129000	Really?
129000	132000	Because next Monday I'll be, fuck you, I'm in Tahiti. I'm a cliche.
132000	135000	You should podcast from there.
135000	145000	Yeah, I know. I will Minecraft from there and maybe I'll try to see if a Twitch signal can go through the swordfish or whatever they have for internet.
145000	157000	There's a handful of things. One thing is that I've started watching the Tim Allen Santa Claus trilogy and there's just so much to talk about with that.
158000	161000	But I think I'm going to wait.
161000	169000	Well, my new friend whose work I have been binging who's going to come out. He's a writer-director.
169000	174000	So that, unlike this one other thing, is something I can talk about with him.
174000	178000	So that means I'm leading with the following.
178000	182000	But I'm going to try to give you the Reader's Digest version.
182000	187000	It gets tragic. It gets touching. Dave, are you cool? Are you cool with this? Are you still cool with this?
187000	188000	Yeah.
188000	189000	Okay.
189000	190000	Dave said you.
190000	191000	Yeah.
191000	192000	Yeah.
192000	193000	Yeah.
193000	197000	I guess I kind of tipped something by referring to Dave in the front row. So wipe your brain of that because...
197000	200000	It's going to ruin the dramatic tension.
200000	204000	Yeah. Well...
204000	214000	So for the second time in a month, because the front gate on my lavish three-bedroom property in Las Feliz is...
214000	227000	I don't know if it looks like an apartment building's gate or if the Proud Boys are having meetings in Las Feliz now and they're just getting enough Dutch courage to wander to my place, but then they're so drunk they forgot why they're there.
227000	243000	But there's this new tradition mounting where my doorbell will ring and then I'll turn on the security camera and I'll see the creepiest thing you could ever see, which is a dude who has no idea where he is just trying to punch fucking codes on a keypad.
243000	258000	This is the second one and I think it was 1.30 in the morning doorbell. You wake up from a dead sleep, doorbell ringing.
258000	269000	Unless you're 24 years old, there's no way 1.30 AM doorbell is going to lead to... I'm trying to think back. I'm like, maybe that's Andy Dick.
270000	278000	When I was in the mood, like, hey, life works in weird ways. Let's fucking rock and roll.
278000	287000	Or like, hey, it's the Lonely Island guys. They came over to open a laptop and show me Dick in a box before they upload it to the thing.
287000	298000	Hey, 1.30 in the morning is a magical time if you're young. I am 45 years old. I live in a fucking house at the top of a hill. I have a gun that I barely know how to load.
298000	310000	I have a girlfriend that I don't want to watch die and just the doorbell rings and it's interrupting my dreams about Minecraft and I'm like, who could that possibly be?
310000	316000	Turn on the cameras and it slowly comes up. Everything looks creepy in night vision.
316000	325000	And there's just no way to look comforting when you are standing on someone's porch in night vision camera mode.
325000	328000	Can we... I will show the people and if you're...
328000	329000	We heard there was a clip.
329000	331000	Yeah. So if you're listening...
335000	340000	The craziest thing about that is that it says front door in the corner.
341000	342000	That's terrifying.
342000	346000	That was like... He stood there and did that for 40 minutes.
347000	349000	So he's punching in codes?
349000	356000	Some of the time he was... We were trying to figure out if he was A, punching codes, B, masturbating.
356000	359000	Because all you could see is his arm going like this.
359000	367000	So I was like, the codeian are just standing there going, I think he's trying codes and I'm like, why would he try codes? Where does he think he is?
367000	374000	What rave does he think is starting without him? He rang the doorbell, the dogs are barking, nothing's happening.
374000	378000	And he's just like, what are you on that makes you think like, well...
378000	382000	He's like, come on, there's nine numbers. How long could it take?
383000	388000	And we had... He was jamming on it for so long that I was like, Cody and I had the conversation.
388000	390000	I'm like, I loaded my Glock.
391000	393000	A Glock 19?
394000	396000	I don't know if it's a 19.
396000	398000	I think I don't know what it is.
398000	401000	I'll tell you what it is. It's hard to fucking load.
404000	408000	I'm getting a revolver. That's it. I'm getting a revolver.
408000	412000	Because these... Have you ever put a bullet in a clip?
412000	413000	That's none of your goddamn business.
413000	415000	It's fucking hard. Oh, sorry Brandon, sorry.
415000	426000	Brandon, come back.
432000	436000	I mean, I might have spit on a couple of bullets to make the seal tighter.
439000	441000	You should have called me.
442000	446000	I was just like, these springs are strong.
447000	451000	Why do you think my thumb has this much muscle in it?
451000	454000	I bought a device that's designed to compensate for weakness.
456000	459000	Why would you make it so hard to load?
460000	463000	Why is the bullet a fucking bench press?
464000	467000	If I could bench press, I would go down there and karate chop this guy.
468000	471000	But we really thought about it and we were like...
471000	476000	You had said before, you go like, when you touch a gun, they do studies.
477000	482000	They hook a person up to the things. They monitor their endocrine.
482000	486000	When you touch a gun, your testosterone spikes.
486000	488000	Spikes. Real, real hard.
488000	496000	And I would be lying if I said there wasn't a strange, weird background program in my head that wasn't...
497000	501000	I don't want to say, I hope something happens.
501000	503000	No, that's what testosterone is doing.
503000	506000	But somehow in the background, in the far background,
506000	510000	like not in a way that's real, but there was a noticeable...
510000	516000	I was like, well, I'll tell you, the big headline was that I'm still not over.
516000	520000	I'll still stick to this. I'm sorry if this hits a political button and I understand that.
520000	522000	We live in very, very painful times.
522000	527000	I don't want to hurt you by saying this, trigger arguments with your loved one.
527000	533000	If you're listening, I'm going to subjectively use my I statements and tell you how I felt and how I still feel.
534000	540000	It made me feel very happy that I bought a gun.
541000	545000	Because it was 40 minutes at the...
545000	549000	It was like, rang the doorbell and we're looking at him, we're going, shit, it's another one.
549000	551000	He's drunk. He's drunk.
551000	557000	He was doing shit and he was tapping. There was a tapping on the front door and it was like, is that as key?
557000	560000	Is that as key? He's just tapping his house key.
560000	562000	What if it's a fucking Wolverine blade?
563000	565000	What if he's carving an eye?
565000	568000	What if he's carving a perfect eye?
568000	571000	Look at this motherfucker trying to find a reason to shoot.
573000	575000	That's what testosterone does.
576000	581000	When we were like, okay, the cops aren't coming because what Cody called the non-emergency.
581000	583000	We didn't want to call 911.
583000	587000	We called the police, you call special pickup.
587000	591000	There's a poor person on my porch.
591000	593000	It's not an emergency.
593000	598000	That kind of guilt about, and then that turns into outrage when they don't show up right away.
598000	599000	Who the fuck are you?
600000	605000	Cody called the non-911 police number.
605000	607000	Los Feliz, they show up so fast.
607000	616000	We felt bad for this person, but also he's terrifying us.
616000	624000	Is he going to, when you're drunk and that frat blackout drunk, we've all heard stories from friends,
624000	626000	even some of us may have these stories in our life,
626000	631000	and it's like, yeah, and then I went back and I ended up, I had this dream where I was taking a shit
631000	635000	and then it was in a sink at a pizza hut and I had shattered the window.
635000	645000	What if he goes from harmless mode to a black bear at a camping site,
645000	651000	like there's marshmallows in your glove box mode, where it's still, he doesn't know what he's doing.
651000	652000	Yeah, it's scary.
652000	657000	What if he starts taking the door because whatever he thinks the house is,
657000	660000	he feels like he should be inside and not outside.
660000	662000	And so Cody and I are like, okay, so what do we do?
662000	667000	And I don't know if this is something you're allowed to pat yourself on the back for,
667000	672000	but I was like, we will call the dogs into the bedroom, close the bedroom door,
672000	675000	he can do whatever he wants to the house, we'll continue to wait for the police,
675000	677000	and if he comes in the bedroom, then I'll shoot him.
677000	680000	What the fuck are you waiting for?
681000	686000	If he makes a sandwich, if this guy sits down and makes a sandwich,
686000	690000	but if he touches my muscle, ready to kill this dude to like,
690000	693000	if he starts to binge watch too much cable,
693000	696000	he can't delete any of my saved episodes.
696000	698000	I don't want the motherfucker to use, he can't use my resources.
698000	701000	If he uses my resources, I'm going to be pissed off.
701000	704000	But this is the privilege that comes with security cameras and all this shit,
704000	706000	like everything's very much in control.
706000	709000	And I want to note that too, because we were talking about this other thing,
709000	713000	where I was like, I don't know, just that panic, where the cops eventually came,
713000	718000	and that second where it looked, I was watching them on the camera,
718000	721000	that I also have installed, where I can see the cops showing up,
721000	725000	and when they didn't do exactly what I, I was like, Cody and I were like,
725000	727000	fuck no, fuck you!
727000	730000	It was sort of like, goddamn, you can imagine,
730000	735000	this is an example of chaos happening, and everything's under control,
735000	739000	and it's the safest version of this you could get.
739000	745000	And still, the closeness that I felt with violence,
745000	750000	it wasn't like, oh, the last thing on my mind is whether or not to shoot someone.
750000	753000	I was like, I bought the fucking gun, I bought a power drill,
753000	755000	you never know, you need to put up a shelf, knock a guy down,
755000	758000	put holes in him, kill him forever, ruin your life.
758000	761000	That's what I bought it for.
761000	763000	Time to load it up.
764000	767000	I'll tell you what, if it comes in, I'll shoot him, I'll do it, though.
767000	771000	Our fucking culture is insane.
771000	774000	It's like Chekhov's gun.
774000	778000	You're introducing the gun, so you're not just doing that.
778000	781000	Oh, right, the first act, the gun in the first act.
781000	784000	It's weird, but literally, in your life, you're not doing it,
784000	788000	and then it'll never come into play.
788000	792000	Buying a gun is kind of like making a choice,
792000	796000	I might choose to shoot someone in a way that's not on the table
796000	798000	before you buy a gun.
798000	800000	At that point, I think you're thinking,
800000	803000	this is not like an indictment or anything,
803000	806000	but I think that once you own a gun or have access to a gun,
806000	811000	I think you might think differently because a gun is an option available to you.
811000	814000	That's just something, I don't know, that seems like something
814000	816000	that we should at least talk about.
816000	819000	You are, but it's like, that's an interesting concept.
819000	820000	I want to be honest.
820000	823000	Oh, I had that same thought, thank you so much.
829000	833000	You're right, because I'm saying, I'm being honest using my I statements,
833000	835000	I'm trying to also be accountable by saying,
835000	838000	this is not my political opinion,
838000	841000	this is not even my personal philosophy opinion.
841000	845000	As a cowardly person, I bought that gun
845000	848000	because I got scared about the world falling apart.
848000	852000	I bought that gun as like a donation to a religion
852000	858000	that professes that we're all going to kill each other.
858000	862000	And I paid, I put money in the collector's dish for that church
862000	866000	that uses that money to build itself and preach more.
866000	871000	I fell for it, I put money into it, I got my thing,
872000	877000	and what I'm confessing is that, oh, it works.
877000	880000	Any random thing that happens,
880000	884000	you're happy you bought the Black & Decker people shooter.
884000	887000	Like the way you're happy you got the dust buster,
887000	890000	because, oh, I dropped a glass, there's shit everywhere.
890000	893000	Yeah, but I bought this thing, and thank God.
893000	897000	It is that, and that is the problem.
897000	898000	Right.
898000	901000	It is pretty simple, because it's like,
901000	905000	yeah, that shouldn't be how we're thinking about human life.
905000	908000	Or at least they should then have extra steps involved
908000	911000	to kind of make it harder, because that's a problem
911000	915000	that needs to be talked about, addressed, thought about, researched.
915000	919000	Yeah, I don't know, man, but we call them,
919000	921000	the cops eventually show up.
921000	923000	Yeah, this is a good story.
923000	924000	Every time you have a problem, it's like,
924000	928000	holy shit, I love the police, these wonderful people,
928000	930000	they come up with the flashlight, they're like,
930000	935000	the people call, you could see them calling in,
935000	938000	they're like, they're shining the flashlight,
938000	940000	and they're not seeing the guy.
940000	943000	And then they're like, what the fuck did you do?
943000	945000	Look, I mean, there's shit in the news right now
945000	948000	that's all about this.
948000	950000	I had to call the police once,
950000	953000	and that's how scared I was of this white person.
954000	957000	But I was like, I will take my chances.
957000	960000	I don't want to say, oh, I'm well aware of how privileged it is,
960000	963000	because I'm not aware of the ceiling of it,
963000	966000	but the whole time I'm thinking, Jesus Christ,
966000	968000	this is such a fucking luxury.
968000	969000	It is, though.
969000	971000	To be able to call people and watch them come up,
971000	973000	to pray for the police to show up,
973000	975000	and to be so relieved when they do,
975000	979000	and to have them come up, and the fact,
979000	983000	well, talk about what if the guy was black on my porch?
983000	985000	What if I'm white and the cops are white, or whatever they are?
985000	987000	It doesn't really matter if the cops are.
987000	989000	Cops are their own race, sort of, in how they view things.
989000	991000	That's not meant as a dis.
991000	994000	I'm saying cops have that protective culture.
994000	996000	What if the guy on my porch was black,
996000	998000	that was ringing my doorbell?
998000	1001000	How would that affect when I called the police,
1001000	1004000	and what I was hoping would happen?
1004000	1008000	How afraid would I be, like, okay, what if this,
1008000	1011000	what if this goes pear-shaped?
1011000	1013000	And I was thinking none of that,
1013000	1016000	and it partly because of the white privilege
1016000	1018000	of the homeless guy on my porch.
1018000	1020000	He had privilege.
1020000	1022000	Because I was like, cops, get over here,
1022000	1025000	fast as you can, fucking run up the steps,
1025000	1029000	and if you see a weirdo, grab him and hoist him out of here,
1029000	1034000	hoist him out of here, not fearing about any kind of fucking thing
1034000	1037000	in a world where we read Facebook stories about,
1037000	1042000	a black social worker is helping an autistic person,
1042000	1046000	and he gets shot, all this shit that we defend.
1046000	1048000	So, yeah, anyways, whatever.
1048000	1049000	I don't even know why I'm bringing that up,
1049000	1054000	because it's like, thanks, Dan, for pointing out whatever.
1054000	1056000	Here's the point of my story.
1056000	1058000	That's a true thing for all people.
1058000	1060000	There are times a week, call the cops,
1060000	1062000	and we're all very happy to see them.
1062000	1063000	There really are.
1063000	1065000	I just had to make the joke.
1065000	1068000	But really, the truth is, even myself...
1068000	1070000	Obviously, it's a class thing, not a race thing.
1070000	1074000	Like, if you live in Bel Air and you're a Fresh Prince, you...
1074000	1075000	I think it's a crime thing.
1075000	1077000	If you're a black person and you're calling for a misdemeanor,
1077000	1078000	then everybody's cool.
1078000	1079000	Right.
1079000	1080000	If it's a murder, then everybody's like...
1080000	1082000	And there's that camaraderie, like, when it's raining,
1082000	1084000	and you're like, oh, it's raining.
1084000	1086000	Like, when the drunk guy hit my garage,
1086000	1088000	it was just like a million cops outside my place.
1088000	1089000	Yeah.
1089000	1090000	Everyone's joking about my segue.
1090000	1091000	Right.
1091000	1092000	Like...
1092000	1096000	And it was just sort of like, I love cops.
1096000	1098000	Like, it was just sort of like high school.
1098000	1099000	Like...
1099000	1102000	But if you were drunk, getting bounced out of a bar...
1102000	1103000	Ooh.
1103000	1105000	And because it was like you had an argument with like,
1105000	1108000	maybe the bartender said some shit that you right or wrong
1108000	1111000	thought was like too right wing for you to drink at his bar.
1111000	1113000	Like, all of a sudden, the cops were...
1113000	1119000	Like, your encounter with a cop can make the difference
1119000	1120000	between you...
1120000	1121000	You could spend a life in prison.
1121000	1123000	I know that sounds hyperbolic.
1123000	1124000	No.
1124000	1127000	But like, that can escalate.
1127000	1128000	I guess I...
1128000	1130000	Because I saw a documentary on Netflix about it.
1130000	1131000	Right.
1131000	1132000	Like, even if you're...
1132000	1134000	Like, they purposely did two stories.
1134000	1136000	One guy was a black guy, one guy was a white guy,
1136000	1139000	and the white guy came home, found his mom stabbed to death,
1139000	1141000	and like, because he was like freaking out
1141000	1143000	and the cops were kind of like acting weird
1143000	1144000	about his mom being stabbed to death,
1144000	1147000	he ended up a prime suspect and hauled into jail.
1147000	1149000	And like, the story just cascades from there,
1149000	1151000	where it's like he ends up in prison
1151000	1153000	for like his whole fucking life.
1153000	1154000	Because...
1154000	1155000	Anyways, whatever.
1155000	1156000	Like, come on, Harmon.
1156000	1157000	Get off of this.
1157000	1158000	There's an important part of the story that's so tragic.
1158000	1159000	It's a good story.
1159000	1160000	It's a good story.
1160000	1162000	So I sent this video of the guy on my porch...
1162000	1163000	Yeah.
1163000	1164000	Thank you.
1164000	1165000	...to Dave Klein.
1165000	1167000	Now, if you know what Dave Klein looks like,
1167000	1170000	my personal trainer, he's got long blonde hair,
1170000	1173000	so the video I just showed was of a guy that's got long blonde hair,
1173000	1175000	he's got some leaves in it, and he's in a jacket,
1175000	1177000	and he's like swaying back and forth on my porch.
1177000	1180000	So I sent Dave Klein the next day, I sent him a text,
1180000	1182000	sent the 11-second video of the guy,
1182000	1186000	and I said, hey, don't come over here at 1.30 a.m. again.
1186000	1188000	I almost shot you through the door.
1190000	1191000	That's a good joke.
1191000	1192000	Yeah, that's great.
1192000	1193000	That's a great joke.
1193000	1197000	Everybody loves being told, hey, this guy looks like you.
1197000	1201000	Dave's response, and I wanted to...
1201000	1204000	I asked Dave if I could tell this story,
1204000	1208000	so I think he probably would have realized he's a hero...
1208000	1209000	They'll be on his side.
1209000	1210000	...in the first place.
1210000	1213000	But really think about the fact that I said,
1213000	1216000	Dave, can I please tell this story?
1216000	1218000	And he's like, yeah, you can.
1218000	1222000	Dave responded with, Dan, I apologize.
1222000	1226000	This video is sobering and a major wake-up call from A.
1226000	1234000	I'm going to get some professional help for my drinking.
1234000	1236000	Thank you for bringing this to my attention
1236000	1240000	and also for not shooting me.
1240000	1242000	And I looked at that, and I was like,
1242000	1247000	that's kind of a tonal departure from the Youp guy.
1247000	1251000	Like, he's usually not that dry.
1251000	1254000	He definitely has a high IQ,
1254000	1257000	so he's capable of doing dry comedy.
1257000	1261000	He just doesn't usually choose to.
1261000	1263000	But I didn't bother to...
1263000	1265000	I didn't want to insult him by going,
1265000	1267000	you know it's a bit, right?
1267000	1268000	I don't know.
1268000	1269000	I just didn't...
1269000	1272000	More fucking hilarious comeback, man.
1272000	1275000	Yeah, I also didn't want to weaken myself
1275000	1276000	by going like, LOL.
1276000	1278000	I'm like, no, fuck you.
1278000	1280000	Hey, if you're going to be that funny,
1280000	1283000	welcome to the big leagues where you play to the silence.
1284000	1289000	I mean, I'll admire you when you're dead, bitch.
1289000	1291000	That's the comedy rule, man.
1291000	1293000	I'll fucking pour a 40 on your casket
1293000	1296000	and be like, I never fucking laughed at you, bro.
1296000	1301000	You were so funny.
1301000	1306000	I was too busy tagging my own bits to listen to your tags.
1306000	1311000	So two days after that,
1311000	1314000	Dave rings the doorbell to do our workout,
1314000	1316000	and he's like, open the door.
1316000	1318000	He's completely shaven bald.
1318000	1322000	I see his face, and I go, hey, man.
1322000	1323000	And I was about to...
1323000	1326000	I think I started to do a call back to the joke.
1326000	1327000	I was like, hey, man.
1327000	1328000	Because I couldn't wait to talk to him about it,
1328000	1329000	my funny bit.
1329000	1330000	It was a good joke.
1330000	1332000	And I was like, hey, man, don't...
1332000	1334000	Again, just to remind you, don't...
1334000	1337000	And he's like, Dan, I'm so sorry.
1337000	1338000	So sorry.
1338000	1339000	And as soon as I saw his face, I was like,
1339000	1341000	well, no, it wasn't you.
1341000	1347000	And he's like, what?
1347000	1351000	And I said, did you wake up in jail?
1351000	1353000	No.
1353000	1355000	It wasn't you then.
1355000	1357000	And he's like, oh, my God.
1357000	1358000	Oh, my God.
1358000	1359000	Oh, my God.
1359000	1364000	I enrolled in rehab.
1364000	1365000	He's fine.
1365000	1366000	You're fine.
1366000	1368000	Because he drank...
1368000	1370000	That night, he drank 12 beers.
1370000	1371000	You're doing fine.
1371000	1374000	And took an ambient.
1374000	1376000	So he woke up in his own bed.
1376000	1378000	He didn't know what happened.
1378000	1381000	He was like, hey, I don't know that that's not me.
1381000	1386000	So he had a good faith rock bottom.
1386000	1389000	I gave him the gift, I guess.
1389000	1393000	I still can't figure out if I did him a favor.
1393000	1396000	I don't know how to process that.
1396000	1397000	Yeah.
1397000	1400000	Thanks to you, he ascended from rock bottom,
1400000	1402000	which you also inflicted.
1402000	1407000	It seems really unfair that he called Kaiser Permanente
1407000	1410000	and said, I'm coming in.
1410000	1414000	And yet, if you have a map of the universe in your head
1414000	1417000	where it's possible you did show up,
1417000	1421000	when you look at a video, he said, I called my dad.
1422000	1426000	Anyway, so it's like, so please respect fucking Dave Klein.
1426000	1429000	Self-aware, question mark.
1429000	1434000	But if a question mark can be a Mobius strip,
1434000	1440000	so self-aware that you allow for fucking the uncertainty,
1440000	1444000	which I didn't mean to exploit, obviously.
1444000	1446000	I don't ever want to fool anybody.
1446000	1448000	I've never experienced that where I'm like,
1448000	1450000	no, no, no, it wasn't you.
1451000	1453000	Of course it wasn't you.
1453000	1454000	And I kept looking.
1454000	1456000	Then I started thinking, by the way, Dave,
1456000	1458000	while we were working out, I was doing tummy crunches
1458000	1460000	and I was like, I had to keep going.
1460000	1464000	I was like, was it him?
1464000	1467000	No, you can see the video.
1467000	1469000	He's the bearded man.
1469000	1471000	Look, that's a pissy beard.
1471000	1474000	Dave has a much nicer beard.
1474000	1475000	Yeah, no worries, man.
1475000	1477000	It was just because of your reaction.
1477000	1480000	I was like, my cynicism, I was like, well, wait a minute.
1480000	1482000	I started doing, well, just because it was like,
1482000	1485000	you should be saying, well, you should be going,
1485000	1486000	oh, I don't have that jacket.
1486000	1489000	But Dave said, you do have that jacket.
1489000	1492000	It's hanging in my closet.
1492000	1495000	It's camouflaged, but it could be leather.
1495000	1498000	It's sort of like he's just doing all the necessary.
1498000	1504000	He's trying to be a good person by eating the world halfway.
1504000	1507000	And actually, in a world where people will convince themselves
1507000	1510000	they didn't murder someone that they murdered,
1510000	1514000	we have true crime podcasts and 10-year jury trials
1514000	1517000	where people are just like, yeah, they passed a polygraph test.
1517000	1520000	Yeah, because they don't want to be a murderer, but they are.
1520000	1525000	In that world, Dave Klein, the Jesus Christ of alcoholism
1525000	1529000	is like, yeah, hey, you did a bit where I'd say,
1529000	1531000	I'll fucking shit, fuck it, going to rehab.
1531000	1536000	Well, because of the weird possibility, yeah, well, you know what?
1536000	1539000	First thought, best thought.
1539000	1544000	You should offer a service where you write people's rock bottoms
1544000	1546000	when they black out.
1546000	1548000	And you can come back to them and be like, yeah, man,
1548000	1553000	you fucked a watermelon and you shit out of bar mitzvah.
1553000	1557000	I will say that that dude, you have a full head of hair,
1558000	1562000	whereas this dude was sort of going bald, rocking three dreads,
1562000	1564000	so that might have been the telltale.
1564000	1566000	I did see him out there. I went outside and looked at him.
1566000	1569000	I had to just get verification from Cody because of my face blindness.
1569000	1572000	After we worked out, I did go upstairs and I woke up Cody and said,
1572000	1574000	Cody, just double come for him.
1574000	1576000	It wasn't Dave Klein, right? He was like, no.
1576000	1578000	Right.
1578000	1580000	Also, what happened? What was the end result?
1580000	1582000	They...
1582000	1585000	By the time they came up there, he had disappeared from the camera.
1585000	1589000	I think he was probably just seated, stoop like in the doorway.
1589000	1592000	So they couldn't see him right away. They came up.
1592000	1596000	So you watch the cops like come up. It's like, I just can't,
1596000	1601000	but like the feeling the fear to open your own door
1601000	1605000	and then calling people whose job it is to like, just rant.
1605000	1607000	It's not even their house. And they, I mean,
1607000	1610000	I know that sounds so stupid to say, but it's just like that.
1610000	1611000	Where you're like, oh,
1611000	1616000	I hope these guys that I like inherently mistrust because they're about
1616000	1617000	not having fun.
1617000	1622000	Uh, when I'm skateboarding and in my Pringles commercial of my life.
1622000	1626000	And it's just like so easy to like, like,
1626000	1629000	and it's just, you're just like, those random moments are just like,
1629000	1632000	I hope I see a fucking guy.
1632000	1635000	I go to the fucking big belt full of shit.
1635000	1637000	And I hope his walkies squawking and,
1637000	1638000	and that they're just like,
1638000	1642000	they're trained to just like, they didn't freak out.
1642000	1644000	I was like, why aren't you freaking out?
1644000	1648000	Charles Manson is on my porch. You should be so freaked out.
1648000	1651000	But they're like, well, if that freaked us out, like, what would we,
1651000	1655000	they came up and they, they, that one guy hung back and, you know,
1655000	1658000	did the thing. And then the other guy was like, came up and like,
1658000	1661000	stood him up and like, they, they cuffed him right away.
1661000	1665000	I think it was more about like, you got to get this guy off the property.
1665000	1667000	I don't know what the rules are, but they,
1667000	1670000	they took them down into the street where you could see that they,
1670000	1672000	I think they did like probably as a formality,
1672000	1676000	like a kind of sprighty test and probably took them through him in the
1676000	1680000	drunk tank. But, uh, uh, they, they just kind of, yeah,
1680000	1684000	they like squirted them out and then knocked on the door as they were still
1684000	1686000	like, we went down and like, Hey,
1686000	1690000	how are you and our little pajamas and they're, and they're like, Hey,
1690000	1693000	uh, do you, do you know this guy and you recognize him?
1693000	1696000	Nope. Nope. Looks a lot like Dave Klein, but, uh,
1697000	1701000	right. I think Dave who Dave Klein, it's not spelled the Jewish way.
1701000	1704000	He's like a Viking. Okay. Dave Klein.
1704000	1706000	I said, K L I N E.
1706000	1709000	Like, I really don't know a lot about him. Uh, you shouldn't, no,
1709000	1713000	I'm kidding. Uh, anyways, but it was, it was, it was like, thank you guys.
1713000	1715000	Thank you. And that was it. Like, and we'll never find out.
1715000	1719000	Like, what was that guy? Where was he? What was he on? How did he,
1719000	1723000	I want to know those stories, not out of like justice.
1723000	1727000	I want to know them and I want to know who were you as a second guy.
1727000	1729000	The first guy was like this weird, like, dude,
1729000	1732000	he was like kept checking his phone and trying the code was like,
1732000	1737000	he looked like he had been invited to some party that someone had told him a
1737000	1740000	code. He was a little more conscious and,
1740000	1745000	and then he'd eventually stumbled down the stairs and got into a white minivan
1745000	1748000	and drove away. I'm like, Oh, that's great. Okay.
1749000	1753000	I wonder if you can find out what happens to him by checking the arrest record
1753000	1757000	because you didn't press charges. Right. So what would I look at?
1757000	1762000	Oh, the date of the incident. That's like all public information.
1762000	1765000	It's like an old tiny like medieval town. You can just be like, well,
1765000	1770000	old man Simmons found a cat in the well. Yeah. The daily blotter.
1770000	1774000	Uh, you want to do an incident report and then if you did an incident report,
1774000	1777000	they'll tell you what the situation might be. You can foster this guy.
1777000	1781000	Okay. Well, so I, I wasted a lot of time on that. Didn't waste it.
1781000	1786000	It was fantastic. I grew a garden, uh, over there with that,
1786000	1791000	with that. Uh, if you, if you see, if you see Dave Klein, uh, uh, uh,
1791000	1793000	give him a lot of love and buy him a drink. Cause that's a,
1793000	1797000	that's a rare personality that can take that and then like,
1797000	1801000	and then not say, please don't talk about that in the show. Like I thought that,
1801000	1803000	I mean, that's very giving and wonderful.
1804000	1805000	Uh,
1810000	1813000	uh, but let's, let's, let's make a new best friend. Uh,
1813000	1816000	I just finished binge watching the second season of the show.
1816000	1819000	I've talked about it before. I thought the first season was so amazing and like,
1819000	1823000	it's, it's, it's an Amazon show. So like I, you got,
1823000	1827000	you got a signal boost or people don't see it. So, uh, I,
1827000	1831000	I just, we'll, we'll, we'll talk about his career and talk about the show.
1832000	1835000	I hope it's not an alienating conversation. If you haven't seen the show,
1835000	1838000	I would recommend you watch it. I think it's really, really interesting.
1838000	1842000	And I'm so grateful for him, uh, being willing to come here and talk about it.
1842000	1847000	Uh, uh, the creator writer, director of Patriot, please welcome Steven Conrad.
1847000	1852000	Sorry,
1852000	1856000	if I made you wait a little, uh, a little too long there,
1856000	1859000	I'm sure it's a little, it was the second time I heard this story.
1859000	1862000	It was kind of like, well, okay, here's the thing.
1862000	1866000	I got to talk about this and I gave him a little brief version of it.
1866000	1869000	Um, uh, yeah, so thanks for making peace with me.
1869000	1870000	Thank you.
1870000	1871000	Thank you.
1871000	1872000	Thank you.
1872000	1873000	Thank you.
1873000	1878000	Thank you for paying attention and I bring the gratitude of our entire
1878000	1883000	cast and our team of filmmakers who appreciate any attention.
1883000	1886000	Uh, we have to go a long way from home to work on the show.
1886000	1888000	And, uh, where is that exactly?
1888000	1892000	We shot in Paris, which was not, uh, that wasn't tough.
1892000	1895000	Uh, but being away from your loved ones for that long,
1895000	1897000	I think it's a really interesting thing.
1897000	1899000	I think it's a really interesting thing.
1899000	1904000	But being away from your loved ones for that long and coming home and the
1904000	1907000	show comes out and people don't even notice that it's come out.
1907000	1911000	That part can be a little hard for the dark belly of the golden age of
1911000	1912000	television.
1912000	1913000	Yeah.
1913000	1915000	Anyway, all I mean to say is thank you.
1915000	1916000	Oh, no problem.
1916000	1920000	I, I, I, I really am so interested to talk to you about it because I,
1920000	1924000	the, the first season it was a rare event for me because if I start
1924000	1928000	watching something with my girlfriend and she falls asleep or like,
1928000	1932000	you know, like I don't, like I really remember specifically like I,
1932000	1936000	I chewed another half an Adderall so I could stay up and keep watching the
1936000	1937000	rest of your first season.
1937000	1942000	Cause I was just really drawn in by the kind of like serialized story of,
1942000	1944000	of this like weird world.
1944000	1950000	It's a, it's a spy drama that centers around it's in the,
1950000	1957000	in the near past around the idea of preventing Iran from going nuclear.
1957000	1963000	I guess my first question is how ironic was that as a concept because recently
1963000	1967000	like, I mean, I was like, was it, is it intentionally futile?
1967000	1968000	Yes.
1968000	1969000	Yes.
1969000	1973000	And when we started to make the show, it was especially futile because that
1973000	1977000	the progression toward becoming a nuclear power was headed off through
1977000	1978000	diplomacy.
1978000	1979000	Right.
1979000	1980000	And then it's all newly up in the air.
1980000	1984000	But in 2016, it was a settled matter.
1984000	1988000	Our story takes place in 2012 where it isn't,
1988000	1993000	there are great costs to trying to turn the tide of this election through
1993000	1995000	extra legal means.
1995000	2000000	But we are in the past and looming in the future is the,
2000000	2003000	this notion that this problem was fixed.
2003000	2005000	But the people, but so the people,
2005000	2009000	the viewers are being told, well, this is happening before.
2010000	2013000	Are we, I don't want to use the word supposed to,
2013000	2014000	because you're an artist.
2014000	2016000	So you'll probably say you should feel however you want,
2016000	2019000	but I kind of like, I'm going to ask anyway, do you,
2019000	2025000	did you want me to feel like all of this is for nothing or did you want me to
2025000	2029000	understand that the stakes are high for people like this?
2029000	2030000	The protagonist and his father.
2030000	2032000	Well, I didn't want just you to feel anything,
2032000	2034000	but that's the way it turned out.
2035000	2038000	But that, that's precisely the feeling that we were hoping to,
2038000	2044000	which one of this idea that there is futility from the onset,
2044000	2048000	but that the stakes are high for them and that they're believably high for them.
2048000	2049000	What the fuck?
2049000	2051000	Yeah, I hope Steve's okay,
2051000	2057000	but the stakes for us reduced to the stakes for like a dog day afternoon,
2057000	2061000	which is just to survive the event of the mistake.
2061000	2066000	I mean, it's like I, so the way that I get introduced to the show was
2066000	2069000	the strangest thing I was at a,
2069000	2072000	I was at a meeting and we were talking about just different shit,
2072000	2073000	just random shit.
2073000	2077000	And somebody who I later forgot who it was,
2077000	2080000	it was a person that said, have you guys seen this show Patriot?
2080000	2082000	And I had seen like ads at the airport.
2082000	2085000	They were there. It was like, like the, uh, Michael Dorman, like,
2085000	2088000	like looking at a through an interactive billboard or it was like,
2088000	2090000	what's this Patriot shit? Who knows?
2090000	2093000	But did, did you return off by the advertising?
2093000	2095000	No, I didn't. I was like, I don't know.
2095000	2098000	Someone else had got a TV show. I hope I'm better than them.
2098000	2099000	I don't know.
2099000	2100000	Yeah.
2100000	2102000	Like you see, you see an ad for a TV show.
2102000	2104000	I'm like, how come NBC never did that for me or what?
2104000	2106000	I just, I just have narcissistic feelings.
2106000	2110000	But like I like, I like, I like the guy looked charming.
2110000	2112000	I had no idea he was Australian.
2112000	2113000	We talk about that later.
2113000	2114000	That guy is so good.
2114000	2115000	Yes.
2115000	2118000	Um, but, um, but then, but then it's usually you just get,
2118000	2121000	oh, you see this advertising. Oh, there's a show out there.
2121000	2123000	It's called Patriot. Who knows what the fuck that means?
2123000	2127000	Uh, and then someone in a meeting that I was with said,
2127000	2128000	have you guys seen this show Patriot?
2128000	2133000	And what they said that made me bother to watch it was something that
2133000	2134000	it doesn't even sound on paper.
2134000	2136000	Like it shouldn't make me want to watch it, which is basically like,
2136000	2141000	it's like, uh, it's kind of like an Ian Fleming novel.
2141000	2143000	If Wes Anderson directed it,
2143000	2147000	which that might be incredibly offensive to you.
2147000	2150000	I mean, it involves other creatives and it's like defined,
2150000	2153000	but it made me go, what?
2153000	2157000	And so I watched the pilot and then it was just sucked in.
2157000	2159000	I was sucked in by the cynicism.
2159000	2164000	I was sucked in by the, but the, the, there are there,
2164000	2167000	the themes that you seem to, uh,
2167000	2170000	I don't want to dissect you and diagnose you.
2170000	2174000	I want you to talk about what motivates you. Good luck. Um,
2174000	2177000	if you've listened to an episode of this show, you know, I'm a bad interviewer,
2177000	2181000	but like your thing with fathers and sons,
2181000	2186000	your thing with nature versus nurture, your thing with sociopathy.
2186000	2188000	These are the, these are the things that drew me in.
2188000	2190000	Like the first episode of that show,
2190000	2194000	what you're establishing is that there's this fucking strapping,
2194000	2202000	really lovably hunky dude in a ratty sweater who is smoking weed in Amsterdam.
2202000	2205000	And you're getting through backstory that he's a CIA,
2205000	2209000	probably black bag wet operator,
2209000	2214000	someone who's good at killing people and that his father works at the CIA
2214000	2218000	and that he's been kind of like hanging out in Amsterdam,
2218000	2222000	smoking weed and writing songs about how he kills people for the CIA
2222000	2226000	and performing them in open mic clubs.
2226000	2230000	And there's just so many amazing choices that the show makes in those first
2230000	2234000	moments where it's like, Oh, the CIA isn't going,
2234000	2238000	we have to stop him from singing those songs. They don't care.
2238000	2242000	He's like, that's it. He's just singing songs. And by the way,
2242000	2245000	and we'll talk about it later, but you, these are all your songs.
2245000	2248000	You're a musician. You write, you write and record these songs and stuff.
2248000	2252000	But like he sings these songs about what he's doing, like his mission is like,
2252000	2257000	like, Oh, I gotta, gotta kill a guy in a turban and I don't know if he's good or
2257000	2261000	bad. And I don't know what that, but the guy's like, he's, he's,
2261000	2266000	he's good at killing people, which is a sociopath job,
2266000	2270000	but he's, he either is or isn't a sociopath. Yeah, it is.
2270000	2273000	It's all that stuff. Dan, for sure.
2273000	2276000	Spread out, spread out.
2276000	2281000	But
2281000	2286000	this man is like a professional Dan handler.
2286000	2290000	Very insightful, Dan. However,
2290000	2296000	right, Dan, a lot of things come chocolate, but this is a brownie.
2296000	2301000	All of that is the case with the, with the story. But
2301000	2306000	all of it exists only to allow our guy to start tackling this task
2306000	2311000	in a way that I hope would be more familiar to an audience as it regards
2311000	2316000	their own lives. There are so many mornings I wake up and I'm just not
2316000	2320000	prepared for whatever it is that I have to do that day. Like a,
2320000	2324000	even like a parent teacher conference, I'm not prepared, buying shoes.
2324000	2330000	I'm not prepared. I, I always feel like I'm, I lack some attachment
2330000	2333000	to, to preparing and then finishing. Well,
2333000	2338000	anything that's in front of me, because my mind's always somewhere else.
2339000	2342000	And I know that that's true of most people and I thought it wouldn't be any
2342000	2347000	different for a person in this walk of life. The job then was just to fill his
2347000	2353000	head with some ideas and some energy that would make him someone worth spending
2353000	2358000	time with. And the sociopathy, it's because he was raised by a person who
2358000	2364000	made him sort of super American and that he imposed on him values that you
2365000	2369000	really have to be taught when you're little, because you, you throw them off
2369000	2374000	when you're older, when you reach the age of reason, acute patriotism is a
2374000	2379000	thing that you learn in the Boy Scouts you just ought to be into. But then when
2379000	2381000	you get older and you look around and you think, well,
2381000	2385000	all that means is that I'm obligated to strangers who probably don't have my
2385000	2391000	best interest at heart. And your dad, because he's a welder or a, or a bus
2391000	2395000	driver by the time you get to adolescence and are going to shrug off
2395000	2400000	and realize that it's bullshit. You've probably also already seen your dad pay
2400000	2403000	the price for it too, unless your dad works for the CIA. In which case there's
2403000	2408000	no reason for him to depart from that company line that I, I'm so glad that
2408000	2414000	like, like, like, but okay, well, maybe this is a total derailment, but now, okay,
2414000	2417000	talk about your dad, talk about you and you're like, is this how autobiographical
2417000	2423000	is this or how? Yeah, I had a highly charismatic father who was always the
2423000	2426000	smartest person in the room and it didn't matter if there were two people in the
2426000	2431000	room or 200 people in the room. He always dominated the flow of events and he was
2431000	2435000	always the bottom line. And it was an intimidating person to share dinner with,
2435000	2442000	but I had this inherent trust for any direction he gave me. I would feel like
2442000	2446000	this must make sense because my dad asked me to do it. And then the older I
2446000	2453000	got, he turned back to man-sized, he turned back to human over time. As you
2453000	2459000	became an adult, you saw him maybe up against shit. And then our
2459000	2464000	politics were different and at some point it's hard. He liked, he liked, he
2464000	2470000	liked, he didn't like 27 dresses and you're like, actually, that's really good.
2470000	2473000	He loved gremlins too. He's like, I can't believe I'm meta it was. And you're like,
2473000	2478000	come on, it was a little, kind of ate itself a little bit. When are we going to
2478000	2484000	talk about Tim Allen's Santa Claus? I don't know. This is too, I can't, I'm like, I
2484000	2489000	really, I'm really like fanning out by the way because I really have a lot of
2489000	2494000	respect watching you like 20 episodes of you. I'm so up for it. I appreciate it so
2494000	2498000	much. And it's amazing that what I'm hearing is like, I really cynically
2498000	2502000	thought I was not going to hear what I'm hearing because honestly, one of the least
2502000	2507000	accessible things about this character is his weird compulsion to please his
2507000	2513000	father. I really don't like, I feel state on my father and I, I have to run like,
2513000	2519000	what ifs in my head of like, if my dad was the kind of dad that, that asked things
2519000	2524000	of me, which he wasn't, I respect the fuck out of my dad and would love to gain his
2524000	2529000	admiration, but there, but there's the, and it's like, but this idea of because
2529000	2534000	this character, he's just physically tortured and emotionally. It's crazy where
2534000	2539000	it comes from. I remember reading an article, an interview with Emilio Estevez
2539000	2548000	and they asked him, did his father, did he urge the kids to be in that business? And
2548000	2555000	what Emilio said was, no, I think we both just admire our dad and if our dad was
2556000	2560000	a roofer, we would be in the roofing business. And that made sense to me. I didn't have
2560000	2566000	that kind of, I didn't adhere to my father like that, but I, I think you need a father
2566000	2572000	and if you're fatherless, you'll feel it. You'll be groping in life for some lessons
2572000	2576000	you might learn more easily than the hard way. And yet fathers can be the worst thing
2576000	2580000	and then generally turn out to be the case. You need one, but it's not the end of your
2580000	2586000	problems having one. It can be, uh, it's, I am endlessly fascinated by it. I want to
2586000	2591000	ask you a question that is part spoiler kind of, if anyone in the audience is like, has
2591000	2595000	not seen the show and therefore is going to watch it. I don't think this is a tremendous
2595000	2599000	spoiler. It's not like a plot spoiler. It's a little bit of a character spoiler, but I
2599000	2605000	can't, I need to ask you about it. This father is the actor who plays Locke from Lost. What's
2605000	2609000	that actor's name? By the way, this cast is just fucking incredible. Kurtwood Smith is
2610000	2617000	every single actor is, is like, you just kind of like someone that you're, you're, you just
2617000	2626000	like watching them talk. And, uh, the, the, but so that father in the second season, there's
2626000	2631000	a distinct point, like right about smack in the atonement with the father section of the
2631000	2638000	story circle of the second season, about three quarters through where, where, where, where
2638000	2644000	it's all of a sudden, and maybe I'm wrong about this for the first time it's revealed
2644000	2653000	that his father doesn't do wet work, doesn't do physical conflict. You're dead on. That
2653000	2659000	was devastating for me. Yeah. I was like, Oh no, I thought, I thought he would give me
2659000	2664000	such a boring interview. I haven't seen the show. What are you talking about? It's a CIA
2664000	2669000	father and son. And like his son is like this fucking, like, like, like he fucking
2669000	2673000	kills people for a living. It does shit that hurts him. He loses like limbs and figure
2673000	2679000	that anyways, but like, but don't you think that that is that fathers expect their sons
2679000	2685000	to do things that they can't do themselves? I do that too with my son. I say, why can't
2685000	2690000	you get an A in science? I could never get an A in science, an A in math. And I find
2690000	2695000	myself saying, well, I expect you because you have, you have a different intellect to
2695000	2701000	be able to do that. And then I stopped myself and I, I raised my son in a way where I always
2701000	2706000	quit when I started to say, well, if someone's picking on you, you have to fight them because
2706000	2710000	I don't think I would do that. And maybe it would be that I just would chicken out, but
2710000	2714000	I know that I wouldn't do it. But my father would tell me to do things that I knew he
2714000	2722000	wouldn't do. And, but that is a small identification of a large thing that our guys in government
2722000	2727000	ask our young people to do. And they would never do it. How many presidents have we had
2727000	2732000	who in a row now who haven't been in the army and then they're so happy to send our young
2732000	2735000	people out like they're a little army men. And they're certainly, if you're, if you're
2735000	2740000	a patriot, part of being a patriot, you, you can't allow for that concept of like, wait
2740000	2745000	a minute. The, uh, it was a lot. I was in my forties before I learned cause my ex-wife's
2745000	2750000	dad was a, uh, uh, uh, what do you got? A chaplain in the Navy. That was the first time
2750000	2757000	I actually learned that officers don't come up through the ranks. They can just start
2757000	2761000	there. Yeah. They just started officer school and I was like, especially the chaplains.
2761000	2765000	That'd be funny though. If they had the chaplains in there at the beginning, you know, I'm just
2765000	2768000	asking them like military questions. I was like, just answer me questions about how the
2768000	2771000	Navy works. And then along the way, I'm like, wait a minute, go back. Wait, what? And it's
2771000	2775000	like, oh yeah, no, infantry, like regular rank and file people, they can actually, there's
2775000	2780000	a ceiling at like sergeant. If you're going to be a general, you go to a special school
2780000	2786000	called, you're going to be a general maybe. And then my question is like, why doesn't
2786000	2793000	that just destroy everything? And the answer is patriotism, not as opposed to, uh, the
2793000	2797000	pride we feel in a system that it's precisely what we're writing about. Yeah.
2797000	2804000	And so, and so it's like, it's like your dad saying, I'm, I'm, do you think that our
2804000	2808000	protagonist in Patriot, do you think he thinks that he's a smart person? Do you think he
2808000	2813000	thinks his dad is smarter than him? We caught up with him at a time where he's too overwhelmed
2813000	2819000	by events to think that his challenges, he knows that thinking is a big, big problem.
2819000	2823000	The only, the only space he has to express anything other than marching forward is through
2824000	2831000	the music. So he, he's, doesn't contemplate the right or wrong. He fights to get out of
2831000	2837000	the fix that he's in and the show, it, it only takes place over 17 days now when we're
2837000	2841000	20, we're 20 hours in. I know there's all this nonlinear shit. You do so many things.
2841000	2846000	This is the highest compliment I want to give you. And I hate when people pretend that
2846000	2851000	they're backhanded compliments or compliments. I really do not mean it this way. I want to
2852000	2858000	say that like I, I disagree with your, or not disagree with, I'm befuddled by some
2859000	2865000	choices that you make so often and I'm still riveted. Like I, I will go like, wait, does
2865000	2870000	this guy, I will ask myself every 10 minutes while I'm watching your show, is this guy
2870000	2876000	a sociopath? I will ask myself if you're Republican or Democrat. I'll ask myself if you're, if
2877000	2884000	if you think that, me too, me too. I will ask myself if you think it's funny to like bully
2887000	2891000	people, or if you're like doing what I do in Rick and Morty, which is like, Hey, it's
2891000	2896000	a fucked up universe. I'm doing what you do. But like you do it in a way that's like very
2896000	2901000	challenging sometimes. And, but also the results are, it's incredibly funny because I believe
2901000	2906000	that the guy is real because he's in, he's in a terrible job. He's like the equivalent
2906000	2913000	of a sewage plant worker. Yeah. Well, he has to work in shit. The show, it focuses on people
2916000	2922000	who break things that can't be put back together versus the shows that concentrate on problems
2923000	2929000	that can't be solved swept under the rug or put in the past. So, so in that sense, there's
2929000	2933000	a little bit of a different bargain we have with the audience where you will, well, if
2933000	2938000	you take Dog Day Afternoon, which is a model for us, I think you know within 10 minutes
2938000	2943000	that they will, they will not accomplish that goal. Accomplish the goal of what? A robbing
2943000	2947000	the bank, getting away with it. Yeah. The narrative goal. Yeah. Right. And you know,
2947000	2952000	it will end poorly for someone you care about, but you continue to watch. And the question
2952000	2958000	that I ask as a filmmaker is why do you continue to watch? What is it that compels you to stay
2958000	2963000	interested in this thing? And I think you, you make a connection to that kind of energy
2963000	2969000	where you are just watching someone try to fix something that can't be fixed. Does it
2969000	2973000	have to do with the women in the family? Because the, the mom is a strange, you know, like I
2973000	2977000	keep, because one of the things that I ask being from the Midwest, like you, while I'm
2977000	2982000	watching the show, there's kind of a, it's, it's sort of like the, so it's like, like,
2982000	2989000	I keep asking myself, well, when is the scene coming where, where we, where we understand
2989000	2995000	that the son admires this father so much? And then I think to myself, that scene is called
2995000	3001000	the son becoming his brother. His brother's just like a, a diplomat. Like he's like kind
3001000	3007000	of like, it's, I don't want to explain your, your characters, but I feel like the, the
3007000	3015000	part of the irony of the story is that the brother who is, doesn't work in murder, that
3015000	3020000	he wishes he could, he, it's like, it's like, like he, he's like very comfortable lying
3020000	3026000	and like kind of digs it, but he wouldn't be good at it. Is that? Oh, absolutely. The
3026000	3032000	happiest people in Patriot are the ones who work in government at the level that, of
3032000	3038000	congressmen or cabinet member. But there's always guys, it's like all this masculinity
3038000	3046000	and then it's almost like if you talked about it, even for a second, it's a seal that would
3046000	3055000	break and your father, for instance, would go, oh, my son just expressed, like you can,
3055000	3061000	you can come to your father and say, I'm in a mess. I'm losing my mind. I'm, I'm, I'm on
3061000	3068000	a million drugs. Uh, I, but what you can't say is I don't want to kill this person. I
3068000	3072000	am feeling insecure. I'm feeling vulnerable because the dad would immediately, I've talked
3072000	3080000	to like stunt my friends who are stunt workers and they go like, oh yeah, like, uh, I, I,
3080000	3084000	I had to get kicked in the balls and the harness failed. So Will Smith was just kicking my
3084000	3089000	actual balls for 20 takes, but I couldn't, I, I know I have a legal right and I could
3089000	3093000	have gone like my actual balls are being kicked there. I don't know if I can have children
3093000	3098000	anymore, but it's the wild, wild west. It's going to be a hit. And if I, there's this,
3098000	3105000	there's this stuntman code that's like, I, I'm here because I don't slow anything down.
3105000	3109000	I am. The whole point of my job is someone says, it'd be great if someone could jump
3109000	3115000	out a window, start on fire and roll around and you want to be that person. Yeah. Uh,
3115000	3120000	and, and, and, and, and that if you ever go like, even if you nail it and like roll
3120000	3124000	and everyone's applauding, if you stood up and said like, huh, kind of touch and go there
3124000	3130000	for a while or that it was, fuck you. Like that there's a fear there of like a vulnerability.
3130000	3136000	Well, we have an episode in season two that if you, if you do watch the show, you'll recognize
3136000	3143000	that we have these, uh, title cards that introduce one episode after the other that are unique
3143000	3149000	to the show. There was a show bright. Thank you. They all have a, we don't call them episode
3149000	3157000	16. We say Patriot 16. Like I hope that that creates this idea that there can be a, uh,
3157000	3163000	an unexpected necessary next place to go. But in season two, we have an episode that's
3163000	3170000	called fuck John Wayne, uh, for, for all the reasons that you're talking about. And I thought,
3170000	3176000	why don't we just say it? We'll write it on a shirt and we can make some noise about
3176000	3185000	people before us who used our art form to make themselves rewarded and make other people
3185000	3192000	diminished by their make believe. I love some people's make believe and I don't like other
3192000	3197000	people's make believe and I don't particularly like his. So, so we had, we, I think we were
3197000	3202000	very clear about that, that we are on the side of the people who believe that that kind of
3202000	3209000	bravery comes with a terrible cost. This is a comedy by the way. But there are people in your
3209000	3214000	show. I mean, like, let me, let me, let me throw some questions to you because we're talking
3214000	3220000	about tonality. So like, like the, the little fella that comes to Paris and is like, he's the
3220000	3227000	little cop from Milwaukee and he, and, and, and our, our hero is drunk and high. And I'm so
3227000	3233000	resonating with this moment where he's like, I have gotten so fucked up, so drunk, so high. I'm
3233000	3240000	having such a good time with my friends and all these cops have followed me to Paris. And, uh,
3240000	3245000	and one of them is little, he's a, I don't know if he's clinically a little person. He's a little,
3245000	3250000	he's a little person. He's, he's so little that they talk about how little he is and they talk
3250000	3255000	about how strategically therefore he's, he, you, we don't have to fight him because his strides are
3255000	3260000	shorter and all this stuff. And like, there's a moment, there's the moment before, uh, our hero
3260000	3268000	quote unquote, it gets into the cab. He's so drunk and so high and he, he's like, he's doing the
3268000	3274000	actual traditional, like he's holding the little guy's head. So he can't punch him. And it's sort of
3274000	3280000	like, you know, I asked him, I asked him not to do that. And he, Mike Germany said, it's impossible
3280000	3286000	not to do that with that thing. But it was, but I mean, you're thinking like, are you thinking like
3286000	3292000	like, life is so cruel. Like it's like, it's almost like a, like, cause I, I'll tell you this story
3293000	3299000	because this, you know, what do you want? This, this really happened. What's that? Yeah. Well, if
3299000	3303000	you didn't want him to do that, what did you want? No, tell me the story. Go ahead.
3307000	3309000	I think this is true.
3312000	3318000	Well, we weren't going to believe that's the, that's how the Iliad begins when with five best.
3319000	3326000	That's actually how your show begins. The entire show is, is appropriately. There's the whole
3326000	3330000	wrap around is there's a, some kind of hearing happening where everyone is going, answering
3330000	3335000	questions from an unseen service or going, Oh, this is what happened. I think it is true that in
3335000	3340000	the 1980s, when cities were all broke and falling apart in crime rates, we're going through the
3340000	3347000	roof that in Jersey city, New Jersey, the so many policemen were being injured that the insurance
3347000	3353000	companies were growing, going broke, paying out their bills, their health bills. They, they
3353000	3360000	instituted size restrictions that were new to the police force cops who weighed too much, had to
3360000	3366000	go work in an office and cops who were under a certain height had to go work in an office. So
3366000	3374000	they took good police officers off the street. The part that I like the most that I think is true
3374000	3381000	also is that they gave them a three month period before they were going to pull them out, pull
3381000	3388000	them off the streets and into the offices. And the idea was that if they could make a series, if
3388000	3392000	they could make a series of like spectacular arrests, if they could distinguish themselves the
3392000	3398000	way that policemen do and win awards, they could stay on the streets. So what I pictured when I
3398000	3402000	heard that, and this is the part I actually think happened, that there were a bunch of really tiny
3402000	3416000	policemen running around trying to make really important arrests. Seven dwarves just hauled me
3416000	3424000	off to jail talking about they getting promotions. So picture, picture an office space now the ones
3424000	3428000	who couldn't do that working in an office with each other, like the cop with one leg and the
3428000	3432000	overweight cop and the tiny cop or trying to maintain your dignity in that environment. These
3432000	3438000	are those policemen from Milwaukee and they happen on some evidence that could allow them to
3438000	3442000	bust this whole thing open and they decide that they can do something about it. And they're very
3442000	3446000	good cops. We do love all of them. And you referenced the fuck John Wayne thing, which is one of those
3446000	3454000	other cops. He does a monologue. He was a war veteran and he got injured so much that it hurts
3454000	3462000	when he walks. And for the longest time, he was embarrassed to walk because the face he'd make
3462000	3468000	when he would walk would cause him pain. And he was worried about the face making him a pussy. And he
3468000	3474000	was a soldier after all. And he, he, he one day burst through a membrane by making a t-shirt and
3474000	3480000	writing on marker. And they should, you show MOS footage, flashback of him doing it. It says, fuck
3480000	3486000	John Wayne on his shirt so that he can now walk around a track by himself. It's a shirt for nobody
3486000	3492000	but himself because John Wayne's name was Marion and he didn't go to war. And he, he, he, he, like,
3492000	3498000	all of that stuff is an illusion. And in fact, what's not an illusion is the John Wayne syndrome of men
3498000	3502000	feeling like they have to be men so much that they actually do the least manly thing of all, which is
3502000	3506000	not admit that they are weak, that they, that they have that they, that they are in pain. Well, that's
3506000	3511760	really cool and beautiful. And it's, it's right where we want to be. But you do that with that guy,
3511760	3517520	but the poor little guy, he doesn't have a story. He's just little and you're like, and, and, and I'm
3517520	3523120	not, I'm swear to God, I'm not like calling you out. I'm like, because it's like your show, it's,
3523120	3528240	it's, it's your, your show does these things where I'm like, like, God damn it. Why,
3528240	3531520	why'd you do that? But if I knew why you did it, you'd be Chuck Lorre.
3532320	3533760	Like, it's not over yet.
3533760	3534480	Chuck fired!
3535920	3536880	Chuck can take it.
3538800	3542640	If you, if you do care to like the show, you'll notice that everything comes back.
3542640	3544720	Does it come back for that poor little guy?
3544720	3548080	Well, he came back with, we stuffed him in a locker in the first season.
3548080	3550560	I know. He just keeps getting abused because he's little.
3550560	3554640	It's just, I don't, but I'm not, now it sounds like I'm calling you up, but I'm seeing like,
3554640	3558560	I'm seeing like this, but I have the same questions for God. Like that's, that's,
3558560	3560000	that's why it's a big compliment because
3560000	3561280	I don't know if I can do it any better.
3561280	3564800	Because you're, you're, you confuse me sometimes. Like what you,
3564800	3569280	what you'll do things like, so the, the Luxembourg police, like there's this amazing,
3569280	3574320	that like, like the layered decisions, like the Luxembourg police station is this palatial.
3575040	3580400	That's like a, that's just a funny thing. Like you go to Luxembourg, which has a homicide rate
3580400	3586720	of zero until our protagonist comes through town in the story, at which point it multiplies
3586720	3594240	very quickly because it has a homicide rate of zero, um, previous to the narrative happening,
3594240	3601120	the entire homicide department, because it's a less glamorous place, because if your homicide
3601120	3606480	rate is zero, then that makes homicide, the equivalent of like maybe giving parking tickets.
3606480	3613120	And so the entire homicide department is women and the, and there's all these toxic men who are
3613120	3621760	like in lesser departments, criminally speaking, who are losing their fucking minds that murder has
3621760	3628000	come to Luxembourg and these inferior women are in charge of solving it when they know.
3628560	3633040	And, and like the first season, it's like, this is amazing conversations. Your, your,
3633040	3638640	your dialogue has this like weird mystical realism thing to it where every single character
3638720	3646400	in your universe basically speaks like one person. Is that an insult? Like, like, like, like, like,
3646400	3652880	like, like they, you don't bother with like, oh, this is Flo. She, she's from Alabama. So she makes
3652880	3658400	grits like you, like every character, whether they're an assassin or whether, whatever language
3658400	3664640	of the they're speaking their language and their subtitles, like they all have the same, um, uh,
3665280	3673280	come propensity for, well, I get lost in details. What I'll hear when you say that
3674800	3680400	is that everybody speaks organically. Everybody speaks the way we do to each other. It's halting,
3680400	3684240	it's casual, right? Like you don't bother to do what could be an insulting thing,
3684240	3688560	which is to be a writer and go like, well, this person's a crawfish hunter, so I'm going to,
3688560	3693600	I'm going to modify their vocabulary or their patois or whatever. It's like,
3693600	3699120	there's, they'll like, it's an international spy drama. So people will be speaking French,
3699120	3703600	but the subtitles are like, it's like, yeah, they're saying they're following these chains
3703600	3708560	of logic. It's, it's, it's really good, man. I hope you're not being insulted by what I'm
3708560	3713120	talking to you about because I, I, by the way, I do the same thing. I don't try to affect like,
3713120	3716720	I don't try to make characters. No, please don't give that a second thought. I'm so
3716720	3722240	happy to be here to talk about any of it at all. And I know that you dig the show and I love that
3722240	3726400	it provokes these questions from you. It's our intention to be able to talk about the show like
3726400	3734960	this. Now this idea that everybody talks to each other with some recognizably regular way is,
3734960	3741280	it's a choice of ours to make this thing feel like make-believe, but then also more believable
3741280	3747120	than a Jason Bourne series. Right. It's more believable because of the emotional dynamics.
3747440	3755440	Yeah. Or just the, the, the way the people's appetites get expressed that we can concentrate
3755440	3761760	on the 10 things that someone wants to be able to feel satisfied or to have dignity.
3763120	3769920	People get counted in our show, counted on in our show, considered in the show by each other
3770720	3776080	in ways that allows them to help each other. John is not the only person in the show who needs
3777600	3784800	love. They're all, the group that you identified, the little cop and the one-legged cop, they call
3784800	3788320	themselves the broken toys. Yeah. Yeah. But everybody in the show is a broken toy. But you
3788320	3793600	throw that away. You totally throw that away. Like the season two, it said one time, right?
3793600	3799440	Right. That's what you, you, that you throw shit like that away all the time. Like you'll just
3799440	3804320	have three cops sitting there and then they'll go like, all right, broken toys. And I'm like,
3804320	3810560	what broken toys? Like they're the misfit toys. Yeah. That's an important distinction. But I,
3810560	3818240	I said broken season three, they recreate that, um, three Rankin and Bass. Well, if we're allowed
3818240	3824240	to make one, they recreate that Rankin and Bass stop motion misfit toys song together
3824960	3828480	in a Christmas episode. Jesus. That sounds unsellable.
3829120	3835280	But if you want to do it, I can know some stop motion animation studios. Yeah.
3836240	3845840	Yeah. I can help you with that. Award winning, uh, have done similar things. Uh, I, there's,
3845840	3852320	you said something. So here is the fucking crazy, uh, Marianna's trench like question for me.
3852960	3856160	Does this fucking show take place in reality or not? Because
3856960	3864480	you defy for me, like I, you, it makes me twitch when I'm watching the show precisely because
3864480	3872320	I'm usually able to like at some point go, okay, this is a metaphor or IE like it's like
3872320	3879680	mystical. Like, like, like you watch like a, like a crazy ironic, uh, action movie where you start to
3879680	3886080	go, okay, this is tongue in cheek. Like, like, yeah, I like crank or, uh, gun or shoot gun, shoot
3886080	3890000	them up or whatever. Where it's like, where you're like loading fingers into a gun and shooting
3890000	3898640	people with their own fingers. The, your, your show it, it, it jet skis like back and forth across
3898640	3908000	the, the wake of that because the, the most fundamental things about traveling and doing
3908000	3916400	things are what are driving things. They all make everything go awry. But I'm so curious about like
3916400	3921680	how you think stabbing people and shooting people works because I don't, you, maybe you're right
3921680	3928000	and I'm wrong or it's like every, people keep getting stabbed and shot in your show and they're
3928000	3935680	like, I got stabbed. And then they're like, can you, can you help me? And then like someone goes,
3935680	3941680	yeah, like, like, I don't know. They just like don't seem to, I would like, if I got my fingers
3941680	3947840	shot off, spoilers, sorry, like I would be like, okay, no more fingers, no more. That's it. Take
3947840	3955040	me to jail. My dad's been stabbed. What's that? My dad's been stabbed a couple times. So I don't
3955040	3962080	know who he doesn't work here. I thought he was with you. Do you guys know? Can we hear at least
3962080	3967040	one of those stories? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I'm happy to let's, I want to hear about your dad
3967040	3973600	being stabbed. He got, he got robbed on, what do you call it, New Year's Eve, New Year's Eve in
3973600	3978880	LA. And the guy was like, give me your money. And my dad was like, fuck off. And he was like, no,
3978880	3984880	give me your money. And my dad was like, fuck off. And then he was like, wha pa, wha pa. And he,
3984960	3992160	he got him twice. Is that French? Is that French for redundant? It's, uh, it's French for stab.
3993760	4001040	Um, but yeah, he caught him in the face. Great. It was good. They call him, I don't remember how
4001040	4007120	to say scarface in Spanish, but that's what he wanted people to call him. I don't think it caught
4007120	4013760	on. Um, but it happened in LA and he went back and I was like, check this out to Columbia where
4013760	4022080	he lives. My dad was in Columbia. Whoa. Hey guys, it's me. No, no, sorry. No, this is all just to say
4023760	4027840	people can be stabbed. Yeah, I know what there's so many amazing, like here's,
4027840	4033200	here's an example of your show being both grounded and absurd in a way that completely draws me in.
4033200	4037120	There's a cold open of one of your episodes that I almost wanted to like transcribe and just read
4037120	4042160	aloud. I really am very grateful that I didn't do it because people should, I want to like,
4042160	4048080	look at you as like, uh, like you're, you're, you're, you write incredibly like, like you're
4048080	4054160	writing and directing so many, like, is it all of the episodes or I did all the episodes in season
4054160	4059440	two and I didn't even know I'm like, what the fuck again with this guy, like, like written and
4059440	4065280	directed Jesus. Great. Are you hogging credit or are you a fucking animal? But like, like you're,
4066000	4069360	you're doing too much and stuff. And then I'm like, no, but the same voice is permeating. And there's
4069360	4075680	like, there's a cold open where it's just our protagonist and he's like ostensibly at some point
4075680	4081040	during his training and he's like looking through a weird textbook and all you hear is the off-screen
4081040	4085600	voice of a CIA instructor. That's Tim Blake Nelson. Who's who's what's that? That's Tim,
4085600	4092080	Tim Nelson. The off-screen instructor is Tim Nelson. And who's it's just a big long monologue.
4092080	4095840	The actor doing the monologue is completely off screen. So all you're looking at is our silent
4095840	4103200	protagonist. He just examines a textbook and all you're hearing is a man explaining how to punch a
4103200	4114160	dog unconscious. It's like, it's not, it's like people don't like you, you run into a thing and
4114160	4118320	the dogs are trained. What's the mistake that people make? Oh, they want to panic. They want
4118320	4122160	to know what do you do? What do you do to a dog? Well, the dog wants to do one thing. He wants to
4122160	4127120	bite a limb. Offer him your, your, your least valuable limb. Use the other limb to punch the
4127120	4134960	dog. Yes. Uh, until it's on the stage. I have said these things and they, and they, and they,
4134960	4140240	and they, and they, and the, and the, and the instructor goes into a gratuitous and therefore
4140240	4146000	further grounding amount of detail about how for God's sakes, the dog's got a little tiny brain.
4146000	4150480	It just needs to be punched a certain amount of times before it goes unconscious. If you were,
4150480	4156080	if you were in a fight with an 80 pound man, you would laugh it off. You would figure out ways to
4157040	4162480	a dog is 80 pounds. Just like, it's like the instructor is an expert on how to beat a dog
4162480	4168960	unconscious, but is still offended by the idea that his students, I really haven't figured it
4168960	4175040	out yet, that it's easier than you think. And all you're just, you just see it, but it's almost like
4175040	4181280	it's Brechtian, like, like, like, like, like, because then Tim, Tim finishes with, please turn
4181280	4187440	to page nine, we'll learn how to knock a woman unconscious with a bicycle. Yes. And then, and
4187440	4192560	only then it cuts to over his shoulder where he turns the page and there's an entire, like that's,
4192560	4197440	I love that then it, because it's a full illustration of how to knock a woman out with a
4197440	4203600	bicycle. But then a cool Rick does it in episode seven. Oh shit. Yes. No, of course he does. No,
4204480	4207360	I'm not going to say I knew that a woman would be knocked out with a bicycle when I saw that
4207360	4212640	illustration, but I, yeah, I mean, you're saying that like, it's like, Oh, that validates it.
4212640	4215840	No, I'm not saying that. No, no, no. I don't mean validating, knocking women out with bicycles.
4215840	4221200	That's not what I mean. I mean, as a writer, I think you didn't, you can do that or not do it.
4221200	4227520	And that's gravy. I'm in isolation. That was, I thought was so fucking cool.
4227520	4233680	Simultaneous to that. Thank you very much, Dan. Simultaneous to that. We're, we're watching
4233680	4240320	Mike Dorman do a Buster Keaton where he's looking around this classroom to try to find another pair
4240320	4248240	of eyes to latch onto. Is it me or, or is being in the CIA going to be, uh, is it going to get
4248240	4252400	worse before it gets better? And he can't find anybody to return that eye contact. So when you
4252400	4256720	get to the end of it, what I'm hoping happens is the audience recognizes that he feels
4257280	4263040	alone and overwhelmed. I mean, that's, that's my point of access for him is that he happens
4263040	4269920	to be good at something that he'd probably rather not do. His songs are, they're not McCartney
4269920	4276480	ask at their level of like, he's not like so into harmony as he is into total self-expression.
4276480	4282960	So it's like, he probably wouldn't be a platinum record. Uh, he doesn't rhyme. He more explains
4282960	4291360	how, but he explains so well. He explains like he, he's so good at explaining the things that
4291360	4296080	he's not allowed to talk about, which is such an unfortunate talent. The reason we made him a folk
4296080	4301040	singer is I recognize that if you're singing, if you're singing folk music in a park, no one
4301040	4309920	listens. They just walk by. They don't even take the time to hear that he is planning on making
4309920	4316800	midnight raids. And so he's an invisible voice. Like that voice of his isn't heard by, by anyone.
4317920	4325280	Yeah. And that, what I love is that the CIA, the CIA and your universe understand that they come
4325280	4333200	into a basement in Amsterdam and, and, and he's, he's laying out everything that he has to do.
4333200	4339280	And the CIA's perspective is like, well, like what they're not, they're not, they're not,
4339280	4345520	they don't care about that. What they care about is that he's not doing it anyways.
4346560	4354400	Well, but this notion that people do get hurt in the show, it's important for, for,
4354400	4359520	it's so important for us to separate from the other shows where that can be the case
4359520	4365200	and that we don't ever walk by someone who gets hurt on Patriot. If someone gets hurt on Patriot,
4365200	4368800	they become part of the Patriot family. They get integrated into the storytelling,
4368800	4375680	the French policewoman that John makes blind, the shop owner who he has to steal the gun from.
4376320	4383680	They all return. And then they, they, they return to us. They return in the form of consequences,
4383680	4392320	but they don't return in the form of accountability. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, what, but, but if you,
4392320	4397360	if you think about, if you, it's, it's not cool to debate your show because your show should just
4397360	4400480	do that. Yeah, of course. That's the thing is like, you're not trying to make a point. I'm,
4400480	4404160	what I'm curious about is as a writer, you're the God of your universe, right? So you make
4404160	4409360	this universe in your universe, this protagonist in the, one of the first things that happens,
4409360	4414560	and this is the thing that sucked me into the show. His job is to get a, a job in Milwaukee at
4414560	4420800	a pipe fitter like a company, which is a hilarious thing that you, you, I mean, again, the chops that
4420800	4426480	you have when you're the runner of the entire series is like all of the, the presentation
4426480	4433200	dialogue with, when people are the difference between, uh, men who are fantastic at talking
4433200	4440000	about pipe fitting. And it's just like this weird fusion of gibberish and real pipe pneumatic
4440000	4444240	terminology. And we don't know where one begins and what ends. It was like, like, like, just these,
4444240	4450240	like, it almost sounds like this, like Jabberwocky poem of like, like anyways, but he has to get this
4450240	4459120	like job at this company and there's one guy ahead of him for the job and he's next to that guy
4460000	4467440	out in the street and he pushes the guy into an oncoming, uh, bus or whatever. And the guy spends
4467440	4473760	the rest of that season coping with his brain injury that he sustained in the, in this accident
4473760	4480240	that got him the job. But it's like the, and I was like, Oh, that's cool. Like, like he,
4480960	4486640	we're going to find out why a human being would get to a point where just because his not to
4486640	4491920	disappoint his father, he would push another man into the path of a, of a oncoming car. Well,
4491920	4500880	but that's the, that's the, an emotional reason. But the, the, the reason John's being told that
4500880	4507680	the math works like this, that country is trying to become a nuclear power. It's our government's
4507680	4514080	position that we can't allow that to happen for any number of threats, reasons, and there will be
4514080	4519600	peril if that happens. And your job is to not ask questions, but your job is to get this bag from A
4519600	4524000	to B to stop that from ever happening. So there's always this idea that there's this greater
4524000	4530160	consequence behind the smallness of our world of, of pain and injury. But the show doesn't care
4530160	4538320	about that. I think you, you can tell where our heart lays in this show. Like we love the small
4538320	4543440	moments. We, we have a, an expression in the writer's room. We just call it Durka Durka when
4543440	4549280	we're talking about the government stuff. And that's from team America. And it just means
4549280	4554240	these are just words that you won't remember, but it's the, it's the super plot. It's the plutonium.
4554320	4554820	Right.
4556320	4562160	Patriot doesn't want to live there very long. I mean, we need that to have a TV show,
4563040	4570000	but we live in acting like the, like the guy that got pushed in front of the car, like that he,
4570000	4575280	I'm saying like, I'm afraid of God in real life. I hate real life. And I write stories because I
4575280	4580160	hate the fact that God like makes my sister retarded for no reason. And there's no resolution
4580160	4584880	to that story. Like, like that I do cruel things to people and I never get punished for it. These
4584880	4590160	are the things that I hate about life. And then I'm, I'm, I'm sort of like, I feel like a difference
4590160	4595280	between me and you is that, and I, and I truly do as a self loathing writer. I go like, I think this
4595280	4600560	makes me, oh, this is something that I see as a strength in you or at least intimidating in you.
4600560	4604880	Like, like, like, I don't like strength, weakness, whatever, better, worse, whatever. But it
4604880	4611120	intimidates me about you, that you don't feel that pressure to make sure that that guy got, that,
4611120	4618720	that got pushed into traffic, that he, I don't know, gets his comeuppance, which he really doesn't.
4620160	4625840	He, he, he becomes like kind of a running gag. I mean, he, he's an annoyance. He's an obstacle.
4626720	4632720	It's an inconvenience to our hero that he did that to a person, but it's like, sort of like, oh,
4632720	4639280	man, I hurt this guy. So now this guy, I got to deal with this guy. The unspoken thing. Maybe next
4639280	4643760	time I'll just kill him. Yeah. That, that, that, that not, you didn't say that God didn't say that
4643760	4648000	in your universe, but it's like, sort of like, it never resolves in like, Oh shit. I,
4649840	4657280	here's how I picked it back up. We, we see, we see John riding his bicycle at night
4657280	4661840	in a really treacherous race where they intentionally run stop signs and run through
4661840	4667440	railroad tracks. And he's singing a song about this young person who he pushed in front of a
4667440	4672560	truck. And he says he has to have a therapy companion now. And he's probably never going
4672560	4677440	to laugh again. And what does that mean? If you can't have laugh, if you can't, if you can't laugh,
4677440	4682720	you probably will can't have love. So he sings this in a song on this bicycle in this race called
4682720	4689920	the Charles Grodin. And then he hurts more people between episode two and episode 10. And then
4690400	4697120	episode 10, he rides in front of a moving car so that he'll be killed. Yeah. So it he's carrying
4697120	4703600	the weight of that stuff. The momentum of that causes him not to want to be alive anymore.
4703600	4708160	Oh God. He wants to definitely wants to die. But it's because of those things. It's because
4708160	4713440	he's been told that these are, these are collateral people and he knows that they're not.
4714160	4723520	So who could love their father that much? The answer is you. And I respect that so much. You
4723520	4729840	are like poor. I mean, you, I like, really, I, here's the thing. Like you, like, we'll, we'll
4729840	4735280	talk about other stuff now. I wanted to take a deep dive into that. Like I, I thank God you're
4735280	4742400	out there like, like, like pitching, Hey, let me do this. And then you're, and then you're just
4742400	4748080	fucking like, like to me, I just, I feel kind of like, like, like I have like a valve in my head
4748080	4752400	that makes me go, okay, but yeah, at the end of the day though, you got to make the nice people
4752400	4756960	happy. And it's not like you're being punk rock and throwing your shit at the audience in a,
4756960	4763280	in a, in a bar. Like what you're doing is like, you're a little bit like the protagonist or
4763280	4772080	something that you're like, you don't have that like terror of disappointing strangers as much as
4773120	4778320	something else. You're answering some kind of, I don't know. You remind me of Nick Pizzolato,
4778320	4782320	the true detective guy. Like, I don't know. It's like, I, these writers that I'm like,
4782320	4786160	what the fuck did you do that for? And they're like, I don't know, man, I'm just fucking right.
4786160	4792000	And I'm like, God damn it. Because, because I'm like, my answer is like, why the fuck would you
4792080	4797520	do anything to make people like you? And like, and then I have this like nuanced awareness of
4797520	4802160	of course they're not going to like you if they ever get wind of that. So I'll do a little thing
4802160	4808560	where he's the guy you love to hate honk honk, but not really like, like, like, and then there's like,
4809120	4813840	in this like streaming age of television where there's like, there's executives that are willing
4813840	4818800	to buy your show because they're going to put it on Amazon where it gets lost in a search engine
4818800	4826160	for spatulas. Like, like, like you, I'm not, I'm not talking shit that, that you have an experience.
4826160	4832800	Like you're, you've, you got a second season, but your show is like, being on Amazon is like a weird
4832800	4839200	mixed blessing. It's like, maybe you'll win an Emmy. Maybe no one will ever find your show ever
4839200	4845840	because they're happy selling irons. Like, like, like it, I don't know. Well, like you're going to
4845840	4851440	respond to that and go, yeah, it's fucked up. Do you hear that Amazon? It's fucked up. Yeah,
4851440	4857040	you should come over to adult swam. But at the same time, it's like, if you and I, if you were,
4857040	4862480	if you and I were like, well, this isn't going to work on CBS, ABC or NBC. So I don't want to live
4862480	4865760	in that world where it's like, Oh, it doesn't work on one of those threes. So let's not do it. I mean,
4865760	4871520	you made a show. It's like beautifully shot. By the way, you're a fantastic director. Like you're,
4871520	4878960	you're, you're, you're, you're, you're fucking like almost obsessive desire to stay in the wide.
4878960	4885440	I want to fucking kiss you. Thank you. Thank you. Damn. You, you play so many scenes in the fucking
4885440	4890800	wide. I love it. Like, like would love you. Thank you. Thank you very much. As a director,
4890800	4894160	I love you. I love that you're a writer. Then you're fucking shooting it and you're like,
4894160	4898800	yeah, fucking why, why ruin a one-er? The fucking guy walks in, they have a conversation. Fucking
4898800	4904320	do it. Don't, when you cut to shit, it disrupts your brain. It's like a seismic event. We're doing
4904320	4910400	rocket my face into another guy's face. I was like, you fucking play scene, like people.
4913840	4919280	I love it. Rocket my face into another guy's face. But that's, that's crazy. Cause that's
4919280	4926880	exactly how I feel. I feel like, whoa, whoa, like not so fast. But you also do crazy POV shit. Yeah.
4926960	4931040	Well, they show to illustrate the effects of drugs and alcohol and stuff like, like, like,
4931040	4937840	which is really effective. It's not obnoxious. Like you just show his POV and you're like, yeah,
4937840	4947280	he's pretty high. Well, I just want the whoever cares to come to the show to really get lost
4947280	4954640	inside of, of that world because we do ask a lot of the audience. It can be peculiar in turns, but
4954640	4962080	the cinema of it shouldn't be. I think I don't want to look like TV. I think the show takes,
4962080	4969280	it's a part of this newer art form where we inherited this thing from the Sopranos and
4969280	4975440	Deadwood where you can just keep the story going. And I wanted it to feel like a new sort of thing.
4975440	4981200	And I have these great filmmaking partners on the show and I'm glad that you appreciated that part
4981200	4984880	of it because it's part of the power of the show. If it works for you, it's part of it.
4984880	4988960	Are you a milch guy? Yeah, I'm a big fan. Yeah.
4988960	4992000	Who's designing those title sequences, by the way, because you mentioned it,
4992000	4995360	like the title cards for your show. Yeah. It's a, it's a graphic designer
4995360	5000000	named Alex Shen who works in San Francisco. This one kid. Oh, really? I mean, yeah.
5000000	5001600	Yeah. Hats off to them. He's really talented.
5003680	5007200	One more thing about just, because I just want to, because you're, again,
5007280	5015760	I mentioned the actors. So like as a writer and director, like on the spectrum of actors are
5015760	5021760	cattle. They're incredibly valuable cattle. So try to find the ones that are the best looking cattle
5023680	5027440	all the way to the other end of the spectrum, which is actually, you know what? We barely do
5027440	5030800	anything. And at the end of the day, either Joel McHale and Alison Brieri and your show,
5030800	5034640	or they're not. And if you like, because they're attractive people, people will tune in. Like I've
5035600	5041040	gone to both places, like in my part where I'm like, you know what we do? We put pretty heads
5041040	5044720	on a body, not pretty heads. That sounds diminishing. I mean, like, like, like people
5044720	5049520	that people want to look at and listen to talk and as writers, because there's a reason why
5049520	5057600	no one tunes into a fucking script. And it's just, how do you feel about actors as a race?
5057600	5071200	I have had films where I'm not directing them. They just kind of go away. If you can't figure
5071200	5076560	out how to communicate to the actor, if the actor is just going to take it. And on Patriot,
5076560	5083280	we just don't have that. We have the getting through the day is the only ordeal on Patriot,
5083280	5089520	just shooting a lot of pages. The actors are glad, I think, to come to work and to be complicated.
5090240	5097040	And we have good looking people in the show. I don't, I guess I don't look at it like that.
5097040	5102720	They've all become really important to me. And they're also like Mike Dorman. He's a good looking
5102720	5108800	guy. Oh my God. But that's not what he, but that's not what he pushes on the show. He's so much more.
5109120	5116880	He's more. No, I seriously, it's really notable the size of Man Crush I get. I think it's more
5116880	5127040	about his sweater. He's like, he's just so cute and so sad. But the show points that out. Do you
5127040	5138160	want to fix him? I want to fix him. Yeah. He's so sad. And all the female characters in the show
5138160	5149520	from little six year old girls to his own mother, they're victims of his sadness. And his own wife
5149520	5155200	is like, yeah, I know he's really sweet. Like when he's high, actually, he doesn't get violent. Like,
5155200	5160320	like, and he, he, he's characterized as sad. And like all these beautiful shots you do,
5160320	5164720	just showing him walking from one job to the next, because now he's going to deal with this. And he
5165600	5171360	he's performing. He's got his Percocet jaw. Like, is that, I didn't, I just found out tonight,
5171360	5179360	because I bothered to Wikipedia him. He's Australian. What the fuck? I just, I can't
5179360	5183840	believe these fucking like Kiwis and Aussies that are like, like they're actors, like they're
5183840	5189600	playing Americans and they're fucking like, like, God damn, these people. We should actually like,
5189680	5195360	we should, we should start closing our borders. Well, it just occurred to me.
5196480	5200560	They're all different. But if I had to make a generalization, which is not a good idea ever,
5200560	5208000	but they, they don't, acting is not a way to become a celebrity there. It's a way to be an artist.
5208560	5211760	So they're not any different than our camera operator. They don't act any different than
5212400	5220400	the rest of our crew. He is a humble and tremendously hardworking artist.
5220400	5226080	I.e. abusable. I mean, I'm being glib, but I.
5226080	5229760	No, he, we, we put Mike in the, he swam the English channel.
5229760	5230960	He did, he did.
5230960	5231760	For a TV show.
5233200	5237520	But he also, yeah, the character climbs over, can I ask you that one question? What's with the
5237520	5242240	electric fence thing? Like, what did you, like, what you, you can climb over an electric fence if
5242240	5249760	you can just withstand the pain. Well, it's a beautiful scene. He explains to the little
5249760	5251920	girl. He's like, she's like, what are you going to do tonight?
5251920	5255920	Yeah. Well, you can, because there are liabilities with electric fences.
5255920	5259040	Here's the, the, they're not allowed to be lethal.
5259600	5265680	Exactly. They, they, they have to be less voltage than would knock a toddler unconscious.
5266560	5269840	Also, if you spread out, in case the toddler wandered into, that's good to know.
5272720	5274960	It's about willpower. Yeah.
5274960	5279840	It's like this random, it's this combination of, if it was just like a sort of like visceral,
5279840	5283920	like, here's how you do this kind of like that high we get from the Jason Bourne thing where it's
5283920	5289920	like, like, I know how to pick a lock and I could say you, you do this weird childish thing that
5289920	5297440	like, I don't know where he goes, like, I have to jump 40 feet onto a balcony. And then the person
5297440	5301840	he's talking to goes, make sure you land on your butt. And he goes, that's not, that's a, that's a
5301840	5308480	absolute mistake. No, that's a lot. Everyone thinks that if you landed on your butt in a 40 foot
5308480	5312080	fall, you're, you could, and he names all the medical things that could happen to you that
5312080	5317760	would basically incapacitate you. He's like, the best thing you can do is submit to the fact that
5317760	5324000	you're going to be unconscious for 17 minutes by going sideways and knocking your head because
5324000	5328240	you're landing on your side and then, and then hitting your, accepting that your head's going
5328240	5332880	to get hit. And so he just, he's like, I'm going to jump 40 feet. Well, that's, but that's in that
5332880	5337520	book. Here's the way it's expressed. The safest thing to do is to land on the organ that is
5337520	5344080	protected by an encasement of bone, which is your head and then on your shoulder. But when we made
5344160	5349120	the book directly on your head, but no, but to like, but that's the thing, like he doesn't,
5350000	5354960	like you can't, if you land on your head, you'll break your neck. Like he doesn't, but, but, but
5354960	5360880	it's like better your head. But like, it's like, it's little shit like that, like where he,
5360880	5366320	that also, it interests the mystical realm because his plan or lack of is that he's going to go into
5366320	5371440	the building and he's going to jump and he knows that he's going to be unconscious for 17 minutes,
5371440	5376640	which he is. He's just a guy laying on a balcony unconscious. And then he wakes up and then he
5376640	5383440	walks into a building that he doesn't have to now clip wires and things. He just laid there in a
5383440	5389200	balcony for 17 minutes unconscious. And then he gets up and goes, I think he snatches the file he
5389200	5395120	needs. It's it's yeah, it's, if you were, if you were asking the viewer to believe every single
5395120	5400720	thing, like Tom Clancy, you, you, you wouldn't get away with that. But you're also saying this
5400720	5405520	person is alone. They're sad and all this stuff. And it's like, it's the, the, the, okay, here's,
5405520	5412400	here's the thing I want to talk about the, it's the, it's that friendship with Rob Saperstein.
5412400	5417520	Is that his name? Yeah. So, all right. So that's gotta be the heart of you. Like, like, like,
5417520	5423280	like what, who is that guy? Rob for you? Like, what is that? That's the friendship for you. That's
5423280	5430800	like crazy. Yeah, I have one of those. Jim Becker is a, is a, is that friend of mine who's a musician
5430800	5436960	who Rob is when I write Rob, I think of Jim. This guy has a friend, he'd rather be a musician. And
5436960	5442240	he has this friend who looks like Jerry Garcia. He's just like this chill dude. But in season one,
5442240	5447200	we, we were pretty sure he hung himself. Right. Oh God. Now I'm spoiling, like, like a watch
5447200	5454240	show. Like, like maybe he did hung himself. Sorry. Who, who he, what he means to John is
5455440	5461120	life whose only complication is do you prefer the Willie Nelson version of Pancho and Lefty to
5461120	5465920	Townes Van Zant? That's where John wants to be. He wants to be in a bar having that debate.
5466640	5470240	Yeah. That's what I want too. That's who he really is. Is that what you want? Do you want to just hang
5470240	5476320	out, drink and with you? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm a, I'm a real joy. I know. But, but, but if you,
5476880	5483680	it's like, do you, do you, do you write and make stuff as a, as a, to what degree is it like,
5483680	5488960	well, I'm a, I suck at washing dishes and I just want to keep people from killing me
5489520	5492800	lately. And what, and to what extent is it like, we're going to do it. Cause it's so important.
5492800	5498720	Like I, I feel like if I found, am I what writing, you mean? Yeah. Well, like, let's say making
5498720	5506400	stuff cause you do all of the above. Like do you, if you, if you, if you were an heir to a Nike
5506400	5512640	fortune, would you be doing what you do? Or do you do it because you desperately didn't want to die of
5512640	5522160	starvation and now it's an addiction. Excuse the pun. My brother, my brother plays a Dennis in the
5522160	5528480	show. My brother's the guy. It was good. Wait, your brother is Dennis? Yeah. Are you shitting me?
5528480	5535840	No. Oh my God. That's so funny. That's, we've been doing that our whole lives, just making stuff up
5535840	5540800	and filming it. And so I would be doing that, I guess with Chris and with my friends on the show,
5541360	5549200	that I, I prefer music and movies to writing anything else because you're not alone all the
5549200	5552880	time. Writing is tremendously hard because of all the time you have to spend by yourself. And
5553840	5559040	it is the, it's the only, it's the only aspect of that color of that huge collaboration of people,
5559040	5565840	that whole thing that only one person does alone. And it's really hard for me and I don't like it
5565840	5571600	an awful lot. And as time goes by, I like it less and less writing by yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Just
5571600	5579440	writing period. Fuck it. Yeah. I mean, you, you know, no, it's fucking like it is, it feels like,
5580480	5583840	yeah, I don't even know. I want to say cutting, but that's like too glamorous. No, right.
5584480	5589280	It's like not cutting. It's like, uh, cause cutting is like productive and interesting.
5589280	5592480	Not to, if you kids and you're cutting, don't, I don't want to glamorize cutting.
5592480	5598240	I'm saying writing is shittier. It's like not as cool. It's like garbage. It's like,
5598800	5603840	it's like rubbing a fucking pencil in and out of your nasal cavity.
5603840	5607040	So you're writing, you're writing right now. I'm trying to find.
5607040	5611040	Yeah, exactly. And it's like, it's like, oh, there we go again. Another reason to feel pain
5611040	5616080	because I tried to fucking figure out how to explain something. Yeah. Geez. That or Minecraft.
5616080	5622320	Thank you. Like, like fuck writing, fuck writing. Like I, thank you for, I'm so glad you said that
5622320	5627840	cause you're truly, I mean, I'm, I feel very confident like, and going like, I know a good
5627840	5631680	writer when I hear their writing, like to me, to me, it's not like, it's not about like,
5632240	5634880	well, thank you to me, like movies and TV shows and narratives and stuff.
5634880	5638960	I have this obsession about structure and stuff where I don't know where I'd be getting in.
5638960	5642240	And that's kind of what I've been circling with. But then you get down to the root of the matter
5642240	5648320	where like, I, I am always like Quentin Tarantino is so good at dialogue. There's such a,
5648320	5654240	I don't care if he falls in and out of fashion. I don't care what it's like interesting to say
5654240	5659440	academically about the structure of his films or whatever. Like I know when someone is writing
5659440	5667280	dialogue, when they have like this gift, like you are, you, you have so much like pouring out of you.
5667840	5671280	I think that's what it is that when I'm watching the show, it's just like, I'm never more than
5671280	5678400	10 seconds away from no matter what corner you've been boxed into. Someone's going to say
5678400	5684320	something that I'm like, huh, that's a weird way of saying that. Like this guy really was on a
5684320	5691360	deadline or drunk or like, I, I, both of those might've been true. So to go hand in hand, but
5691920	5697120	I care as hard as writing is, like, I think it maybe is that hard because I care about it a lot.
5697600	5702000	I think that's the worst thing you can do. And it's the worst job to have something
5702000	5706320	Oh, do you care about it? Like if you're going to make rocking chairs, it's like first rule,
5706320	5710000	care about it. Like if you go to McDonald's and go, care about McDonald's, you probably like
5710000	5714880	excel at McDonald's. You go to writing McDonald's and the, and the, and it's like,
5714880	5720320	Oh, uh, if you care, you're going to fail writing. Don't, don't care.
5720320	5727520	I picture the uniforms and it sounds like fun. I think we should open a writing McDonald's.
5729120	5736640	Well, you're right. Not only will you fail, you will pay a tremendous personal cost in your life
5736640	5741200	too. You'll become a person who's impossible to live with. You'll have a terrible reputation.
5742160	5745280	People will be like, well, I don't know what he's doing down there. He's in the
5745280	5749840	office. He locked himself in. He apparently thinks he's writing the Citizen Kane of episodes
5749920	5756480	about a fucking pickle or whatever. Like he thinks he's fucking hot. I riffed that example
5756480	5760880	as if to like buy it back and go, Oh, that was worth it. Dan was like, no, it probably wasn't
5760880	5767120	that it was like, I, I, I wrote that one in my sleep with like, I, over the weekend with like,
5767840	5774080	it's just like, it's like, like, like the shit I spent this today. I spent today like highlighting
5774080	5780240	and deleting so much shit that I spent so much time writing for fucking like, oh, Rick's gonna
5780240	5786800	really be funny when he says this. And then I'm just like noticing is highlight delete. Because
5786800	5795600	I finally have the luxury of going like, Oh, I, no one's fighting me. I'm in no fight. So now I
5795600	5802160	can objectively go, yeah, that's crap. And then I'm like, no, you spent three hours on that line
5802160	5809440	of dialogue for no reason. Sorry, man. I hate writing is our point. It's just such a garbage
5809440	5818400	job. It's such a fake job. It's a fake job. Well, I went too far. I went too far. You're saying,
5818400	5823200	you're saying the, the, the guild might withhold our payments. No, but I mean, obviously it's fake.
5823200	5828240	It's, it's fiction. It's a lie, but it's more than, it's more than just cause you're, I'm saying
5828240	5833680	you're lying about it being, it's like, are we only, did you either write something good because
5833680	5839760	you fucking like had to, you can't like, I hate it. That was like, oh, I'm going to make this good.
5839760	5846640	And then it's like six hours later and it's like, you made it bad. Have you ever made anything good
5846640	5855920	because you spent more time on it? No, it all accidentally or with an impossible to recognize
5855920	5862720	source just comes to you and you can never call it. All you can do is fend off the people who want
5862720	5872000	their scripts until that happens. The talent you must have is being able to make people wait
5872000	5878480	until that thing finally accidentally comes together. Music's not like that. The music has
5878480	5885680	an entirely different way of coming together that is more peaceful than that. Like the writing
5885680	5890240	fiction is the hardest thing I've encountered among all the different things I do on Patriot.
5890240	5895600	That is the miserable job. Yeah. Chief among it, like figuring out like what someone's
5895600	5899200	supposed to do next, what's supposed to happen next, the plot shit, like you said.
5901440	5906400	Yeah. I just like, I'm like, oh, put two people in a room. Let me have this father say to this son,
5906400	5910960	I need you to do this. And then boy, the son's going to let them have it. But like, I'm different
5910960	5917040	from you because the whole time the son is letting the father have it. I would have one eye on the
5917040	5922640	audience and I'd be going like, right? Like, come on, man. No one likes a bully. And you're like,
5923520	5928720	you're deeper than that to me. Cause you're going like, I don't care. Like I'm like, here's what
5928720	5936960	it feels like to love your father so much that it hurts everyone around you. That's grown up shit.
5938240	5941920	So thank you for doing that. Even though it's next to the spatulas.
5941920	5948800	It's under the spatulas. I really hope the show gets a third season. Just because, well,
5948800	5952560	I actually, maybe I don't because I want you to do whatever you would do if it didn't. I mean,
5952560	5959600	like you're you've done. He's already put in. I, we heard him. He's put in work into the third
5959600	5967680	season already. He hasn't done it yet. Look, I want to see this guy suffer works for me a little
5967680	5973600	bit about Steven. Where are you from? What's state? You said, yeah, the Midwest. Okay. Yeah.
5973600	5976720	What part shot that out just in case we're listening because we go to Chicago every once
5976720	5984080	in a while, boys down Lakeview. Oh, Lakeview boy town. I don't know. Literally. No. So right
5984080	5988640	off a boat, man, a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. But we, we write the show there and no one who
5988640	5993600	works on the show right in there, your offices are there. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, in the summer, please tell
5993600	5998160	me not in the winter. Yeah. Right. You guys, it's easy to write in a, in the winter in Chicago.
5998160	6002560	There's nothing else to do, but I think that helps us that nobody who works in the show
6003280	6008000	has, they're not part of the thing here. They're all just people I picked out
6008640	6014480	from Chicago who have worked with me for 10 years. And the only way they know to do anything is our
6014480	6019440	way, which isn't a better way. It's great. Hey, you can tell them when you go back there,
6019440	6026960	Dan Harmon said they're doing it the right way. No, I really, I really, I, it's like,
6026960	6031600	there's so much like, yeah, it's like, I can tell when you guys are laughing sometimes and then I'm
6031840	6037680	not picking for you. I, I like that idea of like the, the Luxembourg cops, like they're toxic
6037680	6042240	masculinity, like going like, oh, these, anyways, all right, sorry. I'm beating a dead horse that
6042240	6046080	you, you guys are fucking nailing and I hope you get a third season, but then again, if you don't,
6046080	6053760	you're going to make something that's even darker and more awful, uh, that, that, that will benefit
6053760	6064480	mankind. Um, uh, let's talk about Tim Allen's, the Santa Claus. So are you, have you seen the
6064480	6072560	first, uh, thank you for your applause. I have. Have you seen the first one? I, not only did I see
6072560	6079600	the first one, I was traumatized by considering being divorced, which is the heaviest decision
6079600	6084720	somebody can make watching a movie that I think pretty much said the only way your son will love
6084720	6092480	you if you're a divorced dad is if you become this mythical bestower of gifts. I was so drawn into
6092480	6098880	the, my girlfriend and I started watching with Santa Claus one and I, I was like, holy shit,
6098880	6105840	when it didn't fade in on, uh, uh, sleigh bells ring and there's like, uh, like French fry rappers
6105840	6111120	and it was like, like he's like, oh, I hate Christmas. You know what I mean? Or, or like a
6111120	6116640	yuppie who's like fuck Christmas. I gotta work. It was neither. Tim Allen was like, totally get
6116640	6122480	it. The importance of Christmas, like love my family, wish my son would spend Christmas with me.
6122480	6126400	I'm like, wait, this is the third act of most Christmas movies. And I know from the billboard
6126400	6131440	that this guy's going to become Santa Claus. I got really way too excited because I was like,
6131440	6138800	this shit's going to go deep because the only available arc for this guy has to do with his
6138800	6145120	divorce and his acceptance of his sons that he's like, it's like, that he's going to like,
6145120	6149120	that Santa Claus is going to fall off the roof because I saw the trailer. So I know what happens
6149120	6153360	that he gets the suit. And then I was, that he was going to be like, are you fucking kidding me?
6153360	6160000	I'm going to prove my, my son's stepfather, like such a fucking piece of shit. And then,
6160640	6164800	then the reindeer or the elves would be like, dude, Christmas can't be weaponized.
6164800	6170240	We just zoom out for, why are you, why did you watch the three of them?
6171520	6175120	Well, I haven't watched all three of them. I got, I got, I got halfway through the second one,
6175120	6181120	which blew my fucking mind. Or no, no, I got through, I got through the whole,
6181120	6187280	I got through the whole second one. Cause I saw the ending, which blew my mind.
6187280	6191520	But the, uh, the answer is cause Cody's like, she's like, what's a good Christmas movie? She's
6191520	6197200	Jewish. And I'm like, I'm like, there's no good Christmas movies. I like, like Christmas is dumb.
6197200	6204000	I know Christmas isn't dumb, but like the idea that like move, most movies suck. So then you add,
6205280	6210960	Oh, good Christmas. You know, it's like, it's like saying, I don't know. It's just dumb.
6210960	6214880	Like there's Christmas story, but I always, I always like it when we watch it.
6214880	6219440	Like Christmas story is, yeah, I would seen it. Right. How many times can you watch it?
6220160	6224720	So I was glad I watched Santa Claus. Like it turned into a kind of a random like showcase
6224720	6231440	of a standup comics. Like he's like, Oh, he's a good guy. He's very sexy. He's very practical.
6232320	6233360	You're talking about Tim Allen.
6233360	6236560	Yeah. I don't know. I'm saying that that's what the movie is saying.
6236560	6238080	Oh, it's not what you're saying.
6238080	6242960	I mistook it. I said, this movie is going to go deep and it didn't. I was, I was mistaking the
6242960	6249760	movie, like being kind of irresponsibly, uh, amorphous because I think it was so written by
6249760	6255840	committee that I was like projecting. I was like, this shit's going to get fucking cr- nuanced
6256640	6263120	because, because he needs to get over his judge judgmentalism. Like, like, like basically he's
6263120	6267040	going to get in charge of who's naughty and who's nice. And he's going to need to accept that if
6267040	6272640	you have that power, you need to be like Woodrow Wilson's like, uh, administration. You need to
6273280	6277440	anyways, but it, no, I want to watch you watch that.
6279440	6284960	Cody and I, we just pause movies like, and then we're like, the thing we both agreed on the entire
6284960	6288880	time we were watching Santa Claus one is like, we both kept saying, I'm so excited. There's two more
6288880	6295280	of these, which kind of explains or like, that's why there's two more of them. Cause we both kept
6295280	6300560	also going like, yeah, this is starting to suck. Like it doesn't make any sense, but at the very
6300560	6305600	end of the Santa Claus one, which I think it seems like a very low budget kind of thing where
6305600	6311760	they didn't quite believe in it. Like I think Tim Allen was like, eh, like, you know, he's a tool
6311760	6318960	timer or something. And they were like, eh, you know, we'll give you $20 million in some morphing
6319680	6323840	bits. Then maybe the chimney can like morph a little bit. I heard about this morphing thing
6323840	6329280	and we'll build three sets. And it's got, it was kind of like, it was sort of like a sleeper hit.
6329280	6332880	Like it felt like watching lethal weapon one where it's like, oh, they didn't believe this
6332880	6339600	was going to do anything. And then the second one was like, fucking boom. Like, because the first
6339600	6345040	one ends with like a couple of kids putting on jet packs, like elves. And they're like, we got,
6345040	6349120	we're elves and we got jet packs. And then think, and then, and you're like, you can tell that like
6349120	6352960	they want, people watch the first one and they're like, I love the elves and the jet packs. Second
6353040	6359120	one's like $90 million fades in a CG fucking things as elves and jet packs everywhere.
6359120	6365360	This story is so fucking awful. I was like, you know, it's like, like 20. So here's the mind
6365360	6373760	blowing thing. Santa Claus two. Have you seen it? Is it? That's the, isn't that like an open clause?
6373760	6379520	Yeah, it's the Mrs. Claus. So here's the fucking, this is before Jack Frost enters the fray.
6379520	6386480	Okay. In the beginning of the movie, it's like Tim Allen is already Santa Claus because obviously
6386480	6392000	in the resolution of the first movie, he's like, well, now I love, I'm going to live at the North
6392000	6399440	Pole forever until I die and I'm going to be to Santa Claus. So it fades in on that. So he's just
6399440	6404960	like, I'm Santa Claus and I'm Tim Allen and I'm Santa Claus and I love it. I love it and everything's
6404960	6411600	fine. And, uh, and then I'm like, somebody tell him. And he's like, somebody tell me what? And
6411600	6419440	they're like, you have to have a wife or you're going to turn back into Tim Allen. And he's like,
6419440	6426480	oh no. And I'm like, what? What? That would have been relevant. The first movie. The movie's going
6426480	6434480	to happen backwards unless you marry someone. Yeah. I'm already like, okay. Like I know, like,
6434480	6440560	so marry someone, like everyone, like your character is divorced. He's already an expert
6440560	6448960	in the fact that marriage means nothing. Go find a woman and explain to her, pay her in toys.
6449680	6457200	Like, but instead there's like this unspoken thing where he's like, I'll find a wife in 28 days.
6458320	6463440	What do you mean? You could find a wife in 20 minutes. People do it every day. That's not,
6463440	6468160	if you're talking about the actual just ceremony. No, but the, so it's like, no, I have to, I have
6468160	6476880	to fall in love with a woman that's worth my, my undying devotion in 28 days. So in order to
6476880	6485840	accomplish that task, they split him in two with a toy machine. What? What? That turns, that turns.
6485840	6493840	What? Continue. That turns one Tim Allen into a plastic Hitler Santa Claus.
6494720	6502560	What? Yeah. What? Yeah. And the other Tim Allen can slowly morph back into Tim Allen while he
6502560	6511920	goes back to his hometown and finds a woman that he's entitled to that luckily for him,
6511920	6519040	he finds within two women of his two women montage. The first of whom is Molly Shannon,
6520080	6526400	who is simply, he goes on one date in a dating montage. It's one date Molly Shannon shows up.
6526400	6531200	But how can it be a montage? It's not a montage. That's me being like, I'm like, yeah,
6532080	6536480	he, he as a character is playing it. Like he's got a whole dating montage. No, dude,
6536480	6540720	you don't have a dating montage. You fucking you're, by the grace of Christ,
6542160	6547840	you have an ex wife who hooked you up with Molly Shannon, who by the way, is a pretty attractive
6547840	6553840	fucking like woman in it, who the whole gimmick of her characters, she's so into Christmas that
6553840	6562240	it turns him off. Fuck you. Fuck you. It's so fucking crazy. I'm like screaming at the TV. I'm
6562240	6569280	like, first of all, she goes, what do you do? Of course he has to lie because he's Santa Claus and
6569280	6575760	everyone knows if you're Santa Claus. The whole point is you have to lie because I work in toys
6575760	6581280	and he's like, Oh, cause he's like, he's like, I don't know if this woman I'm entitled to is like
6581280	6587120	making the cut. What do you do? And she's like, well, I'm a fucking like, she rattles off some
6587120	6592080	occupations and it gets her unsexy. But then she's like, she's like, but what I really want to do is
6592080	6598000	sing. And he's like, Oh, really? And she's like, yeah, do you know Shania Twain? I love her. And
6598000	6601200	she starts singing a Shania Twain song and everyone in the restaurant starts going like,
6601920	6613360	and including fucking Tim Allen. Fuck you. Marry her now. Stop pretending there's anything at
6613360	6620320	stake. Marry this bitch. You fucking went to New York to find wherever the fuck this story takes
6620320	6625760	place. The big city. Are you fucking kidding me? Do you know how lucky you are that your ex-wife
6625840	6631760	hooked you up with a Christmas loving bitch? You go to dinner, you have to fucking gall. Oh,
6631760	6637760	oh, I don't know if I caught into a fucking chick singing out loud. You're fucking Santa Claus.
6638560	6646960	You live in a fucking secret bunker that if in your wildest dreams, if you go down on her tonight
6646960	6654720	and she likes it, you have to then tell her, please marry me. And if you say yes,
6654720	6661120	come live with me forever at the top of the planet. Yeah. With elves and rain. With a bunch
6661120	6667200	of fucking weird reverse progeria people and animatronic reindeer. And just like,
6667200	6672640	spend your life hanging out while I do one thing one night a year and then suck my dick.
6672640	6677840	Well, will you please, if you would please, if you would please, I would, I require it for my
6677840	6681440	thing. And I was like, oh, and your wildest dreams and Molly Shannon said yes to that.
6681440	6685360	She's singing. I'd be like fucking bank. Let's do it. But he's like, this is, oh no,
6685360	6690960	he's, oh, he falls into a relationship with this, like the principal of the school of his kid
6690960	6696720	who like, he, and then she, and he's like, oh, well, I think I love her. And he goes through
6696720	6702560	the whole movie, the whole movie they go through. So they have to go back to the North Pole. The
6702560	6708720	movie is over in 10 minutes and they go back to the North Pole with the woman who's like the
6708720	6720240	unlikely love interest and uh, they defeat robot Nazi Santa Claus who has decided that all children
6720240	6725200	are naughty. So they should all get coal. So he has an army of toy soldiers, a fucking amazing
6725200	6731120	idea that should have been the whole point of the movie. But like, like, but it's like, instead it's
6731120	6735520	like, oh, he's crazy. He's a crazy Santa Claus, but no, he's not crazy. He's following the rules
6735520	6740880	of being Santa. He should be like, what is naughtiness? Like they, they, they're so close to a
6740880	6746880	fucking profound thing where it's like, what the fuck man? Like fucking let's do this. Like the
6746880	6751440	whole world should be the North Pole. Like that should have been the thing, but they, they, they,
6751440	6760640	the whole movie's about like a pulling back from chances to awake people. Uh, he, he, he, he comes
6760720	6770960	back. Thank you. Thank you, Steven Conrad for your patience. He comes back. While I'm sitting
6770960	6776640	here, I'm just repeating in my head. The whole movie is about what blowing chances to awaken
6776640	6783200	people. He has to find a woman. He has to find a wife and it's not, it would be, it would be a
6783200	6787200	charming thing if they said you have to, you have to find a wife. And then he was like, I have to
6787200	6792000	find a wife and then like would go and like, go like, okay, I have to find a wife and then his
6792000	6796160	heart wouldn't be in it. I need a Mrs. Claus because the, having the institution of marriage
6796160	6801360	be like a formality. And then like the complication could be that he, he fell in love. And that's
6801360	6806400	like a reverse Cinderella. Sure. Or like any, any romantic story ever was like arranged marriage
6806400	6810960	versus the, where the heart wants to go. But instead they're just like, Oh, Jesus,
6810960	6815200	that's not a lot of time to find a wife. I love the way you're thinking about it.
6815200	6820080	So the, so the, so the, so the, the last, the last five minutes of the movie,
6820080	6825040	they come back to the North Pole, Nazi Santa Claus is like almost, oh my God,
6825040	6833360	the ticking clock on this, you guys. Oh my God. Like if they don't catch this guy in time,
6834560	6842880	he is going to gradually deliver coal to one house at a time.
6846160	6850720	And it's like, if in Dr. No, like James Bond saying, I gotta get this bomb,
6850720	6856320	it's gonna, it's gonna like start telling people that the world is blowing up.
6857600	6864400	Like, what the fuck? Let him go. How about this? Like, let him go, put up, build him a second
6864400	6868720	sleigh, let him go deliver coal. That's not going to go over with anyone. Also, they didn't really
6868720	6874640	follow the old marriage then baby. So they could have done for the second movie. They could have
6874640	6879200	gotten a wife and then there's a whole dilemma with a baby, the baby claws. Oh, are you trying
6879200	6886000	to bring Christ into Christmas because Santa's baby is not Jesus Christ.
6888560	6895040	He fights Nazi robot Santa Claus in a conveniently circular arc above the North
6895040	6900160	Pole because it doesn't go anywhere. The sleigh crashes back down where the, where the sleigh
6900160	6904240	left. So no snakes. He was never going to go anywhere. All you had to do was get in the sleigh
6904240	6909120	and inconvenience him. He was a robot Nazi Santa Claus. He was not going to succeed. Even if he
6909120	6913920	did, like how amazing would that be? Hey, everyone got coal last night. Oh, so Santa's real? Fuck it.
6915200	6920560	Nothing at stake. Nothing at stake. It just kills a robot that he created so that he could fuck a
6920560	6928160	woman. Crashes the sleigh and everyone's like, yay, yay, you did it. You beat Nazi Santa Claus.
6928160	6932720	He was a robot. I can't believe you did it. That's so great. And Tim Allen's like, he looks
6932720	6936880	exactly like Tim Allen because the whole point of the movie is that his magic is reversing. So now
6936880	6943280	he looks like Tim Allen and he's like, oh, let's go. Uh, we gotta go. Now let's go do what we do.
6944080	6953040	Let's go deliver the presents. And the elf goes like the head elf goes like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
6953040	6959600	like, like, and, and, and Tim Allen goes, oh, oh, oh, oh. And he looks at his regular Tim Allen
6959600	6967120	body and he goes, oh, and he turns to the female lead of the movie fucking five minutes from the
6967120	6979760	credits. And he goes like, I forgot to tell you that you now have a choice. I'm going to put choice
6979760	6991920	in really big peppermint air quotes. Uh, you have a choice between legally binding yourself
6991920	6999360	to filleting me for the rest of your life in an underground bunker outside of any national
6999360	7009200	jurisdiction or, or, or, or, hey, you have you, it's your choice. Uh, I'll take you back home and,
7009200	7016560	uh, Christmas, no more Christmas forever. And she's like, I've made my decision. It's like the
7016560	7024960	movies is like, yay. It's incredible. I'm not a feminist. I look, I hate women. I, I marvel at
7024960	7028880	this movie. You hate women, but you want Santa to do the right thing. It's what you're saying.
7028880	7037360	Well, no, I'm no, I want screenwriters to be put on a leash. I think if they're writing for children,
7037360	7043120	I don't, I like, why look, here's the thing. Kids don't care about marriage. That's the thing that
7043120	7046720	they ran into in the movie. They're like, look, the guy was already divorced. We swallowed that
7046720	7050640	horse pill in the first movie. It just meant that he was single. So he could do sex jokes and he's
7050640	7054560	like, oh, you're naughty. You're nice. Hey, your ass is nice. And she's like, I'm in your dream.
7054560	7061360	Slay boy. What? Wait, anyways, but like, but the kids are like, and then somebody was like,
7061360	7067520	let's make the second movie about finding a wife. Okay. No, don't. Right. It's a,
7068160	7072560	it's a kid's movie. Don't make it about that. Because then the rest of the, they had to like,
7072560	7077280	then they're like, oh, so the second movie is going to be about, uh, him slowly turning from
7077280	7084160	Santa Claus into Tim Allen while he tries to fuck a woman. Do you think maybe they're just setting
7084160	7090480	up a really majestic third? Well, I happen to know, I know from the billboards of the third one
7090480	7095920	Martin short as Jack Frost. I'm hoping it's going to be like a fucking awesome, like Star Trek thing,
7095920	7104800	where it's like the first two don't even matter. Yeah, I will. I will watch the third Santa Claus.
7104800	7108560	No, I'm like, believe me, Cody's like, why aren't you home? Why aren't we watching the third Santa
7108560	7116400	Claus? Jack Frost. That's a real person. Like, what is that? I mean, I'll tell you what it is.
7116400	7120000	It's a fucking vitamin B shot into the arm of a dying franchise.
7122480	7127040	Wait. But if he's, if he's in a movie, how does that make him a real person? Well, it's just,
7127040	7131920	I don't, it's like we're so, oh yeah, Santa Claus, right? Get it. Like Santa Claus, Mrs.
7131920	7137360	Claus, right? Like he has a wife, get it? Jack Frost. What the fuck are you talking about?
7138480	7144320	What are you talking about? Well, I'm sure he's going to be like a straw dog for secular that
7144320	7148960	whole, but I'm telling you that franchise, I'm not, I don't like, like honestly, it's like,
7148960	7153840	oh my God, it's so skirting. The war on Christmas, the pre-Trump like war on Christmas thing where
7153840	7157840	it's like, you know, yeah, it just felt like, oh my God, this is what we did. We were like liberal
7157840	7162640	screenwriters and like, we just inflated this bubble. We're so surprised it popped because
7162640	7168080	every villain in the franchise is like someone who inexplicably doesn't want Christmas decorations
7168080	7173440	to go up. And it's like, it sounds like something you'd see on Facebook, but it's not because the,
7173440	7180400	the principle that he ends up fucking and imprisoning in his compound and people, she begins as a,
7180400	7186640	as a cuck snowflake principle who, but here's her reason for being anti-Christmas.
7187280	7193760	She doesn't think that school budgets should be spent on such frivolities when people should
7193760	7200320	be focusing on academia. Okay. That's not an actual issue, but it's like pushing these buttons
7200320	7205120	of like, well, come on, can't say Merry Christmas anymore. Like, well, not because of some crazy
7205120	7209920	person who thinks that it saves money. Yeah. Yeah. School budgets are expensive because the
7209920	7214960	people want things. So they jam those buttons and then she ends up going like, yeah, no, it's fine.
7214960	7222560	Like I'll fucking, I'll fuck you forever. Like I met you three days ago and during the time
7222560	7226960	I knew you, you slowly morphed from Santa Claus to Tim Allen and back.
7233120	7240480	He says something right at the end. He marries her on the spot. He gets in his sleigh and,
7240560	7246080	and he, and she's like, see you later. And he's like, Hey, he says something like,
7246080	7255680	like get, get ready. Like, like, he's like, get fucking ready. Cause I do the, I'm going to be
7255680	7259840	out all, he's like a truck driver. He's like, I'm gonna fucking make this hall. But when I come
7259840	7264160	back, you better like, I'm going to take, I'm going to take your mood as an insult.
7264160	7273680	You better, you better spend this time putting the work in of like realizing how much you love
7273680	7278960	me. It was like really, please let that be the title of the show. Turn your mood into an insult.
7280000	7284720	I think there should be an alternate ending where it's just like him in the backseat of the sled,
7284720	7288480	just kind of checked out looking out the window as he's like going home. You know,
7289280	7292720	here are some things that movie franchise never addresses, even though the whole thing
7292720	7298000	invites you to ask questions about how Christmas works. Like all this fun of like, what if there's
7298000	7302880	no chimney? Oh, well then it morphs. Like they never, ever, there's nothing about like, how do
7302880	7310720	we hit every house on the planet in six hours? There's nothing, nothing. What is the morphing
7310720	7317120	chimney part? In the first movie, it's so bad. Like he's just like, I gotta go down the chimney.
7317120	7322720	And then he like, he does this like bad, like pre Jim Carrey mask. Actually, I wonder if it's
7322720	7326560	like, I don't know what their excuse is. I think it's just like, they didn't believe in the movie.
7326560	7330880	And like, so it's just like, it looks like just like a cutout of Tim Allen, like morphing,
7331600	7336560	like he's, he's just being key framed, like in the after effects. It's not like a real
7336560	7341600	CG thing. It's like, it just looks like a 2d magazine cutout thing. Like last star fighter,
7341600	7346640	like he just goes down the chimney. And then, and then, and then they make this big deal about how
7346640	7350640	some houses don't have chimneys. And here's how they handle it. The houses that don't have
7350640	7356720	chimneys. Well, they have like little pipes. And so he morphs to go down there. And then they cut
7356720	7363920	to like their version of a poor person's house, which just has a radiator. And the radiator morphs
7363920	7370560	into a magical doctor who fireplace that apparently travels with Santa Claus. Because you know, the
7370560	7376240	whole point of the movie is to take every piece of the Santa legend and make it real. And so they
7376480	7381920	rich screenwriters are going, well, what do poor people do to justify Santa coming in their house?
7381920	7387200	I don't know. They must think their radiators turned into fireplaces. No, their parents tell
7387200	7392880	them he doesn't come down the, he comes in the door like a human. That's what my parents told
7392880	7396640	me. They're like, no, he's a dude. He comes in the door. I was like, Jesus Christ. I'm like,
7396640	7399200	it's fine. He's not going to kill you. He's going to give you presents.
7399200	7407360	I will. Okay. One more. One thing. Okay. No. Oh God. It's so late. No,
7407360	7412000	fuck you. Okay. We're going to like, like, like, like, uh, uh, uh, I don't know how to end,
7412000	7414960	end shows. Do you, do you, do you know how to end shows?
7417040	7420800	I know I have to get on a plane in 20 minutes. Oh God. Just kidding. No, I have to get in a
7420800	7424480	car to the airport. Yeah. Right. So car comes at 11. All right. Well,
7424480	7428320	everybody thanks Steven Conrad for, uh, emptying his soul and sharing his process.
7431600	7435200	And watch Patriot. Yeah. And watch everything he does.
