27000	42000	Everybody.
42000	45000	Some people call me Pringles dick
45000	49000	But I never really found out why
49000	52000	I don't really have a Pringles dick
52000	56000	I just keep my dick inside
56000	59000	I keep my dick inside a Pringles can
59000	64000	Because it keeps my penis safe and dry
64000	67000	Some people call me Pringles dick
67000	71000	But I never really found out
71000	74000	I never really found out why
74000	87000	Hermit Town is now in session
87000	98000	Brandon Johnson
98000	124000	Rob Schwab
124000	134000	Spencer Crittenden
134000	144000	And just for good fun, Okip opened Mike Eagle
144000	153000	Also, that other guy, the mayor of Hermit Town, Mr. Dan Harmon
153000	155000	Thank you, thank you
155000	157000	Yeah, yeah

163000	165000	Yeah, yeah
165000	167000	Damn it
167000	169000	Yeah
169000	171000	Oh, my sweet surrounding
171000	173000	This is it
173000	175000	The last fucking Hermit Town
175000	177000	We did it
177000	179000	Seven years of sadness
179000	181000	Whoa
181000	185000	Where's the music? There was no music
185000	187000	I sang a song
187000	189000	Oh, yeah, you did it, Okipelas
189000	191000	He wants to do his mama rap
191000	193000	No, no, no, I don't want to
193000	195000	Zach put a beat on so Dan can have some music
195000	199000	I haven't done mama raps ever since Mike taught me to stay off of that crutch
199000	201000	That's right
201000	203000	Is that true? I think you did
203000	205000	That is not true
205000	207000	That is not true
207000	209000	It's purified my flow
209000	211000	Right now, picketing
211000	213000	Waiting to be fucked
213000	215000	Zach, you got some music, Zach?
215000	217000	I got a beat right there
217000	221000	Also, the dude that's been laying down beats for us for a thousand years
221000	223000	Give it up for Zach McKee for everybody
223000	225000	Oh, Lord
225000	227000	Oh, shit
227000	229000	Oh, shit
229000	233000	I didn't really
233000	235000	Oh, yeah
235000	237000	Oh, yeah
237000	239000	Now the pants
239000	241000	Now the pants
241000	243000	Now the pants
243000	245000	Now the pants
245000	247000	Now the pants
247000	249000	I can't hear the beat
249000	251000	Gotta turn it up
251000	253000	Some people fuck mamas
253000	255000	Not me
255000	257000	That's not what I do
257000	259000	My flow is clean
259000	261000	As over's blue
261000	263000	It's white and tidy
263000	265000	Your mama's 90
265000	267000	It's blue on it, too
267000	269000	Talking about my cum
269000	273000	Cause when I'm done
273000	275000	Fucking her
275000	277000	I
277000	279000	A jacket
279000	281000	Ooh, plate
281000	283000	A jacket
283000	285000	Ooh, ooh, plate
285000	287000	I'm here to demonstrate
287000	289000	When I
289000	291000	Nocturnally a jacket
291000	293000	You late
293000	295000	Put it on her plate
295000	297000	Oh, no
297000	299000	That's not that gross
299000	301000	I don't want a picture of cum on plate
301000	303000	See one of those ganzo pornos
303000	305000	That's all cum in a funnel
305000	307000	Or a cup
307000	309000	Or a cracker
309000	311000	Exposed cum
311000	313000	On flesh
313000	315000	Come on flesh
315000	317000	Terrific
317000	319000	As soon as cum hits a floor
319000	321000	Or a couch
321000	323000	Seems like a part two is coming
323000	325000	Once they start adding props to it
325000	327000	Hit that beat
327000	329000	It didn't happen
329000	331000	Oh, no
331000	333000	You think after seven years
333000	335000	We'd be able to drop a beat
335000	337000	You could talk about cumming on plates
337000	339000	We wouldn't be rewarded for that
339000	341000	After seven years
341000	343000	It took him to recognize when to not indulge you
347000	349000	We don't want any more of that right now
351000	353000	So it's the 360th episode
353000	355000	of Harmontown
355000	357000	Uh-oh
357000	359000	Full circle
359000	361000	Full circle
361000	363000	I mean, think about the
363000	365000	unintentional odds that we would end
365000	367000	on a 360
367000	369000	A full
369000	371000	Full circle
371000	373000	What did the odds drop?
373000	375000	What are the odds?
375000	377000	360 odds
377000	379000	We got
379000	381000	We got overflow with like luminaries
381000	383000	up here on stage
383000	385000	Friends of the show and things
385000	387000	This is our jury
387000	389000	And that still wasn't enough
389000	391000	Jeff, we still oversold
391000	393000	Or, I don't know, hopefully there aren't
393000	395000	Anyways, we still had more people coming than we could ever see
395000	397000	So apparently
397000	399000	they're simulcasting to the
399000	401000	Mexican place next door
401000	403000	Shout out to the Mexican place
403000	405000	La Fonda, I guess if you
405000	407000	They're eating delicious tacos
407000	409000	That is a dying
409000	411000	podcast
411000	413000	So hello
413000	415000	to the people over there
415000	417000	Also, Dave Klein over here, can't get a yoop
417000	419000	Get a yoop
419000	421000	One yoop
421000	423000	Really committing to the Chewbacca
423000	425000	thing here with the
425000	427000	Totally
427000	429000	Dan, be honest
429000	431000	Be brutally honest
431000	433000	Happy, sad, how do you feel right now?
433000	435000	Well, I don't know, first of all, I'm exhausted
435000	437000	From a family trip to the desert
437000	439000	I still got sand in every crevice
439000	441000	And
441000	443000	But I don't know
443000	445000	I think it's a very
445000	447000	I'm a very, I think before
447000	449000	I would be able to feel anything
449000	451000	There would be defense mechanisms that would go up
451000	453000	That would keep me from feeling
453000	455000	Which is something I can't really control
455000	457000	I'm a very
457000	459000	Broken person
459000	461000	You were the one that decided
461000	463000	To kill this, and also
463000	465000	I can't believe this lasted more than
465000	467000	Seven weeks, let alone seven years
467000	469000	But
469000	471000	You pulled the trigger on this
471000	473000	Yeah
473000	475000	It's a quote
475000	477000	Mike Eagle I thought
477000	479000	Had a great way of describing it in the green room
479000	481000	And just said it's an emotionally pregnant
481000	483000	Night
483000	485000	I like that, because it's like, happy, sad, I don't know
485000	487000	It's like a pregnancy
487000	489000	You're like
489000	491000	Game changer
491000	493000	And then Emily, who
493000	495000	Started this thing, Emily Gordon
495000	497000	She, it's sad that she couldn't be here
497000	499000	Tonight, but she told everybody
499000	501000	She wished she were here, because she gave birth to this
501000	503000	She was the reason why we started this
503000	505000	She said she wanted to be here when it died
505000	507000	Which you can take
507000	509000	In two different ways
509000	511000	She's at Stonehenge right now, so she's
511000	513000	Like, in a place of sacrifice
517000	519000	But for real, there was no reason the show should have lasted
519000	521000	More than a year, like it was crazy
521000	523000	And we started monthly, right?
523000	525000	And then it became weekly
525000	527000	And then for some stupid reason
527000	529000	It was two hours every fucking time
529000	531000	Uh
531000	533000	I'm only happy that it won't be two hours
533000	535000	In my life every week
535000	537000	But I've met a bunch of people that traveled
537000	539000	From all over the planet
539000	541000	There's people from Spain here
541000	543000	There's people from Italy
543000	545000	There's people from Sherman Oaks
545000	547000	Yeah
547000	549000	What?
551000	553000	I wish I didn't hear that
553000	555000	There's no, yeah, so I'm just gonna come back
555000	557000	You know, we have all these format rules
557000	559000	And one of them is that I stand out there
559000	561000	And talk, but then a guest comes out
561000	563000	And then I take my seat, so I'm just gonna sit down now
563000	565000	It's the central pillar to the show
565000	567000	Yeah, it's structure
567000	569000	Yeah, but think about the time
569000	571000	That we met Spencer for the first time
571000	573000	How many episodes in were we
573000	575000	In when Spencer, that you emerged
575000	577000	Five or something
577000	579000	So that was before
579000	581000	It was a video
581000	583000	That was back when it was just a video
583000	585000	Oh yeah, no video back then
585000	587000	You know that the cops
587000	589000	You know that in America
589000	591000	They can shoot you
591000	593000	With guns
593000	595000	You know that cops in America
595000	597000	This is different from European countries
597000	599000	They think in Canada
599000	601000	But they can
601000	603000	They can lie to you about
603000	605000	They can laugh on you
605000	607000	They can tell you we found a bloody fingerprint
607000	609000	And it's your fingerprint
609000	611000	And they don't have to be telling the truth about that
611000	613000	Good or bad
613000	615000	But here's the thing
615000	617000	I just heard this thing on this True Crime podcast
617000	619000	I thought this was amazing
619000	621000	This girl goes to a party
621000	623000	She disappears
623000	625000	They find her body later
625000	627000	She's been horribly
627000	629000	I won't dwell on the details of the crime
629000	631000	Because I want to skip to the funny part
631000	633000	That's why we listen to True Crime
633000	635000	Because it's for the victims
639000	641000	But
641000	643000	The cops
643000	645000	In trying to get the guy
645000	647000	That they knew did it
647000	649000	But it's like your DNA
649000	651000	Is on the places of her
651000	653000	Costume that are ripped
653000	655000	And all this stuff
655000	657000	The guy is dead to rights
657000	659000	But he's just doing that thing
659000	661000	He tells one lie and then he gets caught in that lie
661000	663000	And he's like well I did have sex at that party
663000	665000	It might have been her
665000	667000	Consensual sex and all this stuff
667000	669000	The cop goes like
669000	671000	Listen man, look we know you did it
671000	673000	But look I don't think you're a killer
673000	675000	I think you did it on accident
675000	677000	Which is something cops always do
677000	679000	And the guy's like dude I never even
679000	681000	I don't even know what you're talking about
681000	683000	And the cop kind of blurts out
683000	685000	And goes like you know something you don't know about this girl
685000	687000	I'm going to tell you something you don't know
687000	689000	Dude she had brittle bone disease
691000	693000	Fuck
693000	695000	The cop just like busts out this amazing
695000	697000	Technique
697000	699000	Because the guy's like going oh
699000	701000	He's like yeah you could
701000	703000	I mean if something happened it's not your fault
703000	705000	That was his lie
705000	707000	Her bones, yeah
707000	709000	Her bones are like made of glass
709000	711000	I just think it's amazing
711000	713000	Like a weird form of victim
713000	715000	He was trying to give this guy an out
716000	718000	You didn't know you were a fucking faberge egg
718000	720000	Yeah exactly
720000	722000	And then the guy totally fell for it
722000	725000	He's like okay look man you know we were doing a little like choke play
725000	727000	And like she choked me and there's no marks
727000	729000	Because my bones aren't brittle
729000	731000	And then I felt like brittle bones
731000	733000	And they're like thank you she doesn't have brittle bones
733000	734000	Go to prison
734000	735000	What?
735000	736000	Damn
736000	738000	Of course they made it up
738000	740000	I thought I had made that clear to the guy
740000	742000	They can make stuff up
742000	744000	I never heard that kind of thing made up
744000	746000	Not one of murder people
746000	749000	I feel like if they can lie they should catch way more people than they do
749000	750000	Yeah
750000	752000	They could just say fucking anything
752000	754000	You know sixty percent of
754000	756000	Of homicide goes
756000	757000	Unsolved
757000	759000	They're not telling the right lies
759000	760000	Or is it
760000	762000	Or is it forty percent maybe I just told one
762000	763000	An important lie
763000	765000	It's one or the other but it's almost half
765000	767000	If you want to kill somebody
767000	769000	You flip a coin you make it away with it
769000	770000	They could say hey we
770000	772000	We fingerprinted you
773000	774000	It doesn't look like you're at the crime scene
774000	776000	But we know that you have AIDS now
776000	778000	Because the person that you murdered has AIDS
778000	780000	Anything you want to get off the chest
782000	784000	Jesus hell
784000	786000	And also it's 1981
786000	788000	And there's no
788000	790000	There's still a lot of misunderstandings
790000	792000	About the illness and technology
792000	794000	What? It's not 1981
794000	795000	Dude
795000	797000	Look at my partner
797000	799000	And he's got a little alligator
799000	801000	That he made out of fabric really fast
802000	804000	That's not a real eyes odd shirt
805000	806000	Yeah it is
806000	807000	They got a fake Rubik's Cube
807000	809000	He's got Debbie Gibson's hat on
813000	815000	So cops can just lie
815000	817000	Here's my phone
817000	818000	Nice try
818000	820000	So my house has been spider gassed
820000	822000	While I was out
822000	823000	I bought this house
823000	825000	And it's filled with spiders
825000	828000	Spider gas sounds terrifying
828000	830000	Apparently there's different gas
831000	833000	If I have cockroaches and spiders
833000	835000	And I call the spider gas guy
835000	837000	Do the cockroaches just smell this gas
837000	839000	And go like yeah fuck those guys
839000	840000	Good
840000	842000	More dried milk puddles for us
844000	845000	What kind of spiders?
845000	847000	You were looking around and there were spiders hanging about?
847000	849000	The house is just filled with spiders
849000	851000	All kinds
851000	854000	So I don't think it was a real actual infestation
854000	855000	But I must have
855000	857000	I have a really good assistant
857000	859000	And I think I just
860000	862000	I was like this place is filled with spiders
862000	865000	And then it got spider gassed
865000	867000	While I was in the desert for Thanksgiving
867000	869000	But then the guy said something
869000	870000	After he
870000	872000	Correct me if I'm wrong
872000	874000	You would not spider gas your place
874000	876000	If they were up front about this part
876000	877000	The guy said
877000	878000	By the way
878000	881000	It doesn't just magically make the spiders
881000	883000	All instantly die
883000	886000	Like you will see a few spiders over the next couple days
886000	888000	Maybe even more than usual
888000	890000	Because they'll be fleeing for their lives
892000	894000	I'm not
894000	896000	That's the only thing worse than a house full of spiders
896000	898000	Is a house full of spiders
898000	901000	You tried and failed to kill
902000	904000	The Josie Whales spiders?
904000	906000	Fucking pale rider spiders
906000	908000	They're like pulling at your leg desperately
908000	910000	Pleading for help
910000	912000	Oh well that's very empathic of you
912000	914000	I'm imagining I'm like fucking Brandon Lee and the crow
914000	917000	Like lightning flashes in their silhouette
917000	919000	And they're like nice try
921000	923000	Like you want to try that again?
923000	926000	Like you just wake up covered in webs
926000	928000	And they're like
928000	930000	They're coughing up blood into their little spider hankies
930000	933000	But it's like they still got enough fight in them to
933000	935000	Do shit that spiders normally don't do
935000	938000	Because they fear repercussion
939000	941000	They're long term thinker spiders
941000	943000	The inventors of the web
947000	951000	Owls are wise
951000	953000	Elephants never forget
953000	955000	Spiders, incredibly patient
957000	959000	Long term thinkers
959000	961000	You don't want to piss them off
961000	963000	That's kind of cool
963000	965000	As a human, if you were hungry
965000	967000	You could just make a plate and wait
967000	969000	Yeah
969000	971000	That's what they do
971000	973000	But then they also
973000	975000	Every spider web you walk through
975000	977000	There's only a one in ten chance that you're actually
977000	979000	Walking through an inhabited spider web
979000	981000	Because they spin one
981000	983000	And they wait
983000	985000	And then they have to decide
985000	987000	When to blame the web
987000	989000	When to blame the location
989000	991000	They just go and do another one
991000	993000	And so that's why cobwebs and stuff
993000	995000	Because spiders are always working
995000	997000	They're like little prospectors
997000	999000	Those guys, good for them
999000	1001000	Alright, well look
1001000	1003000	Hey
1003000	1005000	I decided to end the show, now do you understand why?
1007000	1009000	We are only on episode 360
1009000	1011000	We're down to talking about the patients of spiders
1013000	1015000	And the leverage
1015000	1017000	Cops can wield by lying about
1017000	1019000	Brittle bone disease, which I think is a 30
1019000	1021000	Rock bit, Cody said
1021000	1023000	I think that cop heard that on 30 Rock
1023000	1025000	Brittle bone disease, is that even
1025000	1027000	Is that even real, and if it is
1027000	1029000	And you're offended don't jump up
1029000	1031000	And storm the stage
1031000	1033000	Cause you'll break your motherfucking neck
1035000	1037000	Yeah
1039000	1041000	Your put down just became a PSA
1043000	1045000	We were uh
1049000	1051000	So high right now
1053000	1055000	Yeah
1055000	1057000	Yeah
1059000	1061000	We should name a strain after the end of this show
1061000	1063000	Yeah
1063000	1065000	Oh my god, look at my suit
1067000	1069000	Your suit is good
1069000	1071000	It's a damn good suit
1071000	1073000	I thought it was white
1073000	1075000	You really are that high
1075000	1077000	It feels like a Dean Martin roast
1079000	1081000	We are talking to
1081000	1083000	Brandon Johnson
1083000	1085000	He's the only man that's so high
1085000	1087000	He's the only man I've ever seen walking around
1087000	1089000	With a snake in his hand trying to beat up a stick
1091000	1093000	The stick had it coming
1097000	1099000	So uh
1099000	1101000	I'll give you two choices
1101000	1103000	We can start to share some
1103000	1105000	Favorite memories
1105000	1107000	Of the show or
1107000	1109000	I can get your advice on whether I
1109000	1111000	Should get an 8K TV
1114000	1116000	Because I feel like 4K
1116000	1118000	I feel like 4K is enough
1118000	1120000	Isn't the human eye just
1120000	1122000	1080p
1122000	1124000	I feel like the higher the definition
1124000	1125000	The more
1125000	1127000	The tighter the sweater
1127000	1129000	Yeah
1131000	1133000	A non high five is happening
1137000	1139000	Jerking off a microphone
1140000	1142000	Want to help out
1142000	1144000	Wait
1144000	1146000	I would say
1146000	1148000	Number one but let's go number two
1148000	1149000	Let's go 8K
1149000	1152000	Okay, so do you think I should get an 8K TV?
1154000	1157000	Because I feel like this guy is giving a thumbs up back here
1157000	1159000	I don't know what you're talking about
1159000	1161000	You're the man who stood on stage and proudly proclaimed
1161000	1164000	You wanted the most expensive peanut butter
1165000	1167000	Yeah
1167000	1169000	But not
1169000	1171000	Not
1171000	1173000	Not phony peanut butter
1173000	1175000	That's like
1175000	1177000	This peanut butter makes you fly
1177000	1179000	Because I think when you get up to 8K resolution
1179000	1181000	You're kind of buying a lie at a certain point
1181000	1185000	Doesn't the human eye incapable of seeing beyond a certain resolution?
1185000	1187000	Not at our age
1191000	1193000	I feel like watching old movies
1193000	1195000	On really high resolution
1195000	1197000	Makes it look like a reality show
1197000	1199000	You don't do that
1199000	1201000	No, don't do that
1201000	1203000	I'm not going to do that
1203000	1205000	Stop it
1205000	1207000	I want Dan to go to the second question
1207000	1209000	I told the guy let's stick with 4K
1209000	1211000	Just so you know
1211000	1213000	I asked you for your advice for nothing
1213000	1215000	But I just wanted to
1215000	1217000	Yeah, thank you sir
1217000	1219000	Dan emotionally
1219000	1221000	Emotionally
1221000	1223000	Yes
1223000	1225000	I was able to kind of go through
1225000	1227000	catharsis and through therapy
1227000	1229000	When this stops
1229000	1231000	Are you going to miss what you get out of this?
1231000	1233000	Or are you going to be happy
1233000	1235000	to throw this in the garbage?
1235000	1237000	Yeah, but
1237000	1239000	I'll miss it
1239000	1241000	But you know
1241000	1243000	There's a difference between missing something and
1243000	1245000	regretting
1245000	1247000	You know, I think you gotta
1247000	1249000	I don't know
1249000	1251000	Don't you think Keira's and Keira's wishes
1251000	1253000	You know, a little
1253000	1255000	What?
1255000	1257000	It just took a shit
1257000	1259000	I think you did
1259000	1261000	You can't do a show for
1261000	1263000	No, I get it
1263000	1265000	I'm not one of those guys
1265000	1267000	I'm not like Robert Altman
1267000	1269000	I don't want to die doing stuff
1269000	1271000	What was the reason that you said let's stop
1271000	1273000	Uh
1273000	1275000	I think it was
1275000	1277000	You brought that country western
1277000	1279000	singer up here
1279000	1281000	Okay, that happened
1281000	1283000	I had Mitch Hurwitz as a guest
1283000	1285000	And then you guys
1285000	1287000	You went off stage and sang a song in the green room
1287000	1289000	Steve Leedy, ladies and gentlemen
1289000	1291000	Yay!
1291000	1293000	Wait, you're going to blame
1293000	1295000	the end of Armantown on me
1295000	1297000	bringing Robbie Fox on stage?
1297000	1299000	Yeah, we were going to keep doing the show until that time
1299000	1301000	I think you announced it before that
1301000	1303000	Wait, what do you mean Dan? What are you talking about?
1303000	1305000	This sounds like it went really bad, I want to hear all about it
1305000	1307000	It went bad, yeah
1307000	1309000	Dan, we stopped doing the show
1309000	1311000	Why do you bring up the Robbie Fox
1311000	1313000	coming on stage?
1313000	1315000	I just answered your question
1315000	1317000	That was the night
1317000	1319000	You killed the show
1319000	1321000	He said it's your fault, Jeff
1321000	1323000	Jeff, Jeff, Jeff
1323000	1325000	Jeff, he says it's your fault
1325000	1327000	It's your fault
1327000	1329000	Fuck
1329000	1331000	Why do you need to know that?
1331000	1333000	Why was it Robbie Fox's fault?
1333000	1335000	Why can't it be?
1335000	1337000	Answer the question
1337000	1339000	Answer mine?
1339000	1341000	Answer my question
1341000	1343000	What's your question?
1343000	1345000	Why can't it be his fault?
1345000	1347000	Because he was just a guest
1347000	1349000	Right
1349000	1351000	Well, I didn't book him
1351000	1353000	You didn't book him
1353000	1355000	Oh shit
1355000	1357000	You didn't book Open Mic Eagle, he's here tonight
1357000	1359000	You didn't book him, we ran into each other and he came out
1359000	1361000	And the show's ending
1361000	1363000	I told you
1363000	1365000	There's an Open Mic Eagle band
1365000	1367000	in effect on the show, you defied it
1367000	1369000	Oh shit
1369000	1371000	Yeah
1371000	1373000	This is our find out
1373000	1375000	We have a closed Open Mic Eagle policy
1377000	1379000	Yeah, it's a closed mic eagle
1379000	1381000	The Robbie Fox episode was
1381000	1383000	long after the decision was made
1383000	1385000	to stop the show
1385000	1387000	Why do you bring that up?
1387000	1389000	Because that was the reason
1389000	1391000	I just wanted to keep having the show be fun
1391000	1393000	and not have to do a deposition
1393000	1395000	about why I chose to kill it
1395000	1397000	I mean, I think there's a lot of
1397000	1399000	there's a lot of answers to that question
1399000	1401000	but I don't think, I mean it's like
1401000	1403000	Answer number one, coming up
1403000	1405000	I think that
1405000	1407000	Right after
1407000	1409000	this song
1409000	1411000	by a guest singer that's coming up
1411000	1413000	I think one answer to the question is
1413000	1415000	from a
1415000	1417000	what would you call it
1417000	1419000	a stylistic perspective
1419000	1421000	or I don't think that's quite the word either
1421000	1423000	but there's, I know that
1423000	1425000	one answer but it's probably maybe like
1425000	1427000	10% of the
1427000	1429000	of all the reasons, it's just the whole kind
1429000	1431000	of like
1431000	1433000	moving from a world as we have
1433000	1435000	during the 8 year run of the show from where
1435000	1437000	the internet was a place you hid
1437000	1439000	from the real world to the internet
1439000	1441000	for better or for worse, now the real world
1441000	1443000	and
1443000	1445000	a whole generation went from
1445000	1447000	being 12 years old to
1447000	1449000	whatever 12 plus 8 is
1451000	1453000	I didn't come to LA to do math
1455000	1457000	but 20
1457000	1459000	thank you
1463000	1465000	but the whole, they were
1465000	1467000	born online
1467000	1469000	and the world is online
1469000	1471000	and as such
1471000	1473000	because of all of the social changes
1473000	1475000	and things, it's sort of like
1475000	1477000	this idea of me
1477000	1479000	playing myself as a character
1479000	1481000	like I think
1481000	1483000	I'm at a crossroads at 46
1483000	1485000	having done this for almost a decade
1485000	1487000	and really I've been doing that for
1487000	1489000	25 years
1489000	1491000	going like hey look at me, I'm Dan Harmon
1491000	1493000	you know what happened to me today? I'm going to tell you the whole thing
1493000	1495000	and like I'm the fucking
1495000	1497000	it's me, the name of my birth certificate
1497000	1499000	is the name of this clown
1499000	1501000	so if you have a complaint
1501000	1503000	just type my name into the internet and tweet
1503000	1505000	me and if I do something wrong
1505000	1507000	get me fucking destroyed
1507000	1509000	like destroy my life
1509000	1511000	because my life is, you know
1511000	1513000	that whole thing for 20 years was like
1513000	1515000	yeah that's cool and easy too
1515000	1517000	because I'm lazy
1517000	1519000	and I think we've hit a crossroads here
1519000	1521000	we're doing that as a really specific
1521000	1523000	choice to make now, like moving
1523000	1525000	forward from this
1525000	1527000	if I kept
1527000	1529000	advertising myself
1529000	1531000	as like
1531000	1533000	hey this is my show, this is
1533000	1535000	my name, this is the name of the person I was born
1535000	1537000	here's all of the things
1537000	1539000	about me and all these things
1539000	1541000	I become a brand, like moving
1541000	1543000	forward from here now that we've hit this tipping
1543000	1545000	point of like everyone's online
1545000	1547000	and everything that is online is part of a
1547000	1549000	constant conversation about where everyone
1549000	1551000	stands and what you're going to do about it
1551000	1553000	and it's almost like I don't
1553000	1555000	I like being who I am but at
1555000	1557000	the same time I
1557000	1559000	personally
1559000	1561000	wouldn't continue to
1561000	1563000	listen to a guy in a
1563000	1565000	podcast go like
1565000	1567000	yeah but what about me
1567000	1569000	because it's just not
1569000	1571000	there wouldn't be my choice anymore
1571000	1573000	I wouldn't continue to find it therapeutic
1573000	1575000	because
1575000	1577000	it's just like
1577000	1579000	I would have to either
1579000	1581000	willfully compartmentalize my
1581000	1583000	pride from
1583000	1585000	my narcissism and
1585000	1587000	all this stuff, like put all these parts about
1587000	1589000	me against themselves only
1589000	1591000	for the end goal of having
1591000	1593000	a podcast
1593000	1595000	or I can like let the
1595000	1597000	podcast kind of drift away while I
1597000	1599000	continue this process of letting
1599000	1601000	like who I am
1601000	1603000	kind of like disentangle and
1603000	1605000	like sort itself
1605000	1607000	out because I don't
1607000	1609000	and I mean this with the utmost respect
1609000	1611000	I don't want to, the best
1611000	1613000	case scenario is
1613000	1615000	Joe Rogan, right?
1615000	1617000	You've got a billion people
1617000	1619000	listening to you, everything
1619000	1621000	that you say is like
1621000	1623000	I don't want to be a brand
1623000	1625000	I don't want to stand for things
1625000	1627000	by having been born
1627000	1629000	I don't want to be
1629000	1631000	like whoa
1631000	1633000	that's that Dan Harmon
1633000	1635000	thing, that principle
1635000	1637000	I want to own a
1637000	1639000	gun and be liberal
1639000	1641000	and you can't like
1641000	1643000	I want to do all kinds of
1643000	1645000	paradoxical things and it's
1645000	1647000	and I don't want to have to think about
1647000	1649000	when I'm doing them
1649000	1651000	like how I'm going to
1651000	1653000	figure out how to sell them
1655000	1657000	and again, that is
1657000	1659000	one big bucket that's like 10% of the reason
1659000	1661000	there's a bunch of
1661000	1663000	I just think
1663000	1665000	who wants to start sucking
1665000	1667000	not that the show's
1667000	1669000	ever been good, but
1669000	1671000	who wants to just
1671000	1673000	cheap you know
1673000	1675000	I don't know
1675000	1677000	I can't believe this show ever lasted more than
1677000	1679000	seven weeks
1679000	1681000	the fact that it went for more than seven years is crazy
1681000	1683000	but I've met so many
1683000	1685000	people that have flown from like
1685000	1687000	there's people here tonight that came from all over
1687000	1689000	the planet
1689000	1691000	and there's a
1691000	1693000	weird
1693000	1695000	relationship that people have
1695000	1697000	there's people that have gone through depression
1697000	1699000	or illness or injury
1699000	1701000	and they
1701000	1703000	have a connection to this show that
1703000	1705000	I don't understand
1705000	1707000	because we just get up here and just
1707000	1709000	kind of fuck about
1709000	1711000	for us it's just silly
1711000	1713000	or maybe for you or for me
1713000	1715000	or like for Spencer
1715000	1717000	or for the
1717000	1719000	Dave Clines, the people that we brought up
1719000	1721000	on stage
1721000	1723000	Trump
1723000	1725000	Brandon
1725000	1727000	You fuck about too?
1727000	1729000	But like
1729000	1731000	it's always been a weird way to be kind of cathartic
1731000	1733000	and kind of like let out whatever's
1733000	1735000	going on in our mind but like
1735000	1737000	there's people that have
1737000	1739000	for me, I don't really understand
1739000	1741000	the connection that people have that people are really
1741000	1743000	sad that it's ending
1743000	1745000	because they went through
1745000	1747000	like psychological
1747000	1749000	stuff and this
1749000	1751000	show had an impact on it
1751000	1753000	I don't get it
1753000	1755000	I was listening to the show
1755000	1757000	the podcast last week
1757000	1759000	and
1759000	1761000	I don't know if you listened to the show
1761000	1763000	last week
1763000	1765000	Jeff, but the end of the
1765000	1767000	show last week just devolved
1767000	1769000	into all of us screaming
1769000	1771000	over each other
1771000	1773000	No you did this
1773000	1775000	and I'm like who
1775000	1777000	who doesn't know us
1777000	1779000	would ever want to listen to this
1779000	1781000	I want to turn it off
1781000	1783000	But we found out over the years
1783000	1785000	Kate was like what is that?
1785000	1787000	That's my voice
1787000	1789000	Oh no
1791000	1793000	A giant man has walked
1793000	1795000	on stage and is texting on
1795000	1797000	his phone in the background of the
1797000	1799000	stage Y'all gotta warn me about
1799000	1801000	shit like this
1801000	1803000	What? Do you see
1803000	1805000	something? His shoes are giant
1805000	1807000	Yes I do
1807000	1809000	There's nothing back there
1809000	1811000	What?
1811000	1813000	Nick is on stilts back here
1813000	1815000	that is really terrifying
1815000	1817000	You really need to come out front
1817000	1819000	for everybody to really check out
1819000	1821000	What the fuck is happening?
1821000	1823000	Don't trip on the cable
1827000	1829000	I have to be honest
1829000	1831000	I don't like it
1831000	1833000	Yo it's a great talent
1833000	1835000	but I don't want to be buy it

1971000	1973000	man which is a
1973000	1975000	one for one analog for world's
1975000	1977000	oldest man
1977000	1979000	whereas the world's oldest man
1979000	1981000	we would talk about the things you've
1981000	1983000	seen throughout history and do like
1983000	1985000	historically contextual
1985000	1987000	kind of one liners
1987000	1989000	I guess we're just going to stick to
1989000	1991000	height
1991000	1993000	I hate trees
1993000	1995000	You must have gotten
1995000	1997000	quite a few arguments
1997000	1999000	with specific species of tree
1999000	2001000	Everyone with
2001000	2003000	branches
2003000	2005000	I love
2005000	2007000	light poles
2007000	2009000	I say is it
2009000	2011000	hard for a fella like you to
2013000	2015000	Using his elbows
2015000	2017000	and waist no one's seen
2017000	2019000	He's the tall
2019000	2021000	daddy, a killing machine
2023000	2025000	This is good for
2025000	2027000	an audio podcast right?
2029000	2031000	For $5 you can watch the
2031000	2033000	last episode of Heart of the Town
2035000	2037000	I say is it hard for a fella like you to
2037000	2039000	enjoy the company of women
2041000	2043000	I am way
2043000	2045000	into the crowns of heads
2049000	2051000	Ladies don't hesitate
2051000	2053000	Faster bait
2053000	2055000	He's your tall daddy
2055000	2057000	You know where's the episode of
2057000	2059000	laughing I've ever seen
2059000	2061000	There must be quite a few places you're not allowed
2061000	2063000	being that tall
2063000	2065000	Yeah, let's
2065000	2067000	say them together
2085000	2087000	What's it like down there
2089000	2091000	Look who's back
2091000	2093000	He's at least six inches of butt crap
2097000	2099000	That's pretty average I feel
2099000	2101000	Definitely more than six
2105000	2107000	I'm normally a bad interviewer and also
2107000	2109000	it's bad improv to ask questions
2109000	2111000	so I don't know
2113000	2115000	Shit
2115000	2117000	Tall man on trial
2117000	2119000	There's no denial
2121000	2123000	Alright, alright, I'm very happy to be here
2123000	2125000	Dan, Jeff, all the crew
2125000	2127000	thank you guys so much
2127000	2129000	Scooter for next tallest man in town
2133000	2135000	Nick Rutherford, tallest man
2139000	2141000	I hate the shoes the most
2143000	2145000	They freak you out a little bit
2145000	2147000	They imply that his feet are that big
2149000	2151000	He got regular size hands
2151000	2153000	and size 47 feet
2155000	2157000	No thanks
2159000	2161000	It looks like I'm looking at him
2161000	2163000	with a fish eye lens
2165000	2167000	Mike, what have you been up to?
2167000	2169000	Music?
2169000	2171000	That's the stock answer
2171000	2173000	but it's always true
2173000	2175000	Are you one of those ambitious tenacious sorts
2175000	2177000	that works all the time?
2177000	2179000	Not only because I have to pay for things
2179000	2181000	all the time and that's the only way I make money
2181000	2183000	You have to pay for things to get money
2183000	2185000	No, I have to make music
2185000	2187000	to make money to pay for things
2187000	2189000	You know, I learned
2189000	2191000	a new saying today because we were
2191000	2193000	talking about naked marketing
2199000	2201000	It doesn't sound the way I think
2201000	2203000	you think it sounds
2203000	2205000	because it's like the middle of a song
2205000	2207000	so it's not like every time it's like
2207000	2209000	the song's starting
2209000	2211000	I will never do it again
2211000	2213000	Oh, that's you? You're doing that?
2213000	2215000	Yeah, for 300 episodes
2215000	2217000	I'm blaming somebody in the back with my eyes
2217000	2219000	the whole time
2219000	2221000	These people are professionals
2221000	2223000	It's this motherfucker
2225000	2227000	Did you ever talk about naked martin on this show?
2227000	2229000	No, no, I never have
2229000	2231000	I was talking about it today and Cody said
2231000	2233000	if you do what you love, you never have to work
2233000	2235000	a day in your life
2235000	2237000	For instance, naked martin
2237000	2239000	who came into our lives
2239000	2241000	courtesy of
2241000	2243000	Cody's old roommate Nicole
2243000	2245000	who was on this trip with us
2245000	2247000	Nicole was doing comedy somewhere
2247000	2249000	and some British couple
2249000	2251000	were at the bar
2251000	2253000	getting shit-faced and they were
2253000	2255000	looking at some video on their phone
2255000	2257000	and they were like, do you want to see the funniest video ever
2257000	2259000	and it was like
2259000	2261000	there's this British guy
2261000	2263000	and he's looking at the camera
2263000	2265000	and he says
2265000	2267000	hello
2267000	2269000	Alex and Peggy
2269000	2271000	he gives up this
2271000	2273000	personalized message and goes
2273000	2275000	congratulations
2275000	2277000	on your recent engagement
2277000	2279000	have fun in Hamburg and stay away from those oranges
2279000	2281000	and he gives a little
2281000	2283000	naughty tis finger
2283000	2285000	and has
2285000	2287000	about what I hope is a super long dick
2287000	2289000	Uncircumcised
2289000	2291000	Yeah, and it's kind of uncircumcised
2291000	2293000	and he's very old so it's kind of like
2293000	2295000	I don't think this is an important detail but it is a
2295000	2297000	distracting one that his foreskin has
2297000	2299000	Why do you hope it's super long? Was it long?
2299000	2301000	Well because I want
2301000	2303000	I want the average dick size
2303000	2305000	to be smaller than
2305000	2307000	smaller the better
2307000	2309000	I mean
2309000	2311000	what do you want
2311000	2313000	mortgage rates to be?
2313000	2315000	Lower
2315000	2317000	I assume
2317000	2319000	I'm totally following it
2319000	2321000	keep going
2321000	2323000	you're not even at the
2323000	2325000	he gives a little cautious
2325000	2327000	finger wave about the oranges
2327000	2329000	in Hamburg
2329000	2331000	and flaps his
2331000	2333000	flaccid but long penis against
2333000	2335000	his naked thighs with a quick twitch
2335000	2337000	of his waist and then he
2337000	2339000	reaches down between his legs
2339000	2341000	to underneath his balls somewhere
2341000	2343000	while looking at the camera it gets a curious
2343000	2345000	contemplative look on his face
2345000	2347000	and he's kind of like moving
2347000	2349000	his fingers around a bit back there
2349000	2351000	there's a very strange
2351000	2353000	long pause you don't know what's really
2353000	2355000	going on and then he withdraws
2355000	2357000	a
2357000	2359000	human turd
2359000	2361000	no
2361000	2363000	he withdraws a poop
2363000	2365000	with his hands?
2365000	2367000	and he kind of presents it pridefully and then he
2367000	2369000	smears it all over his face
2369000	2371000	and he gives a thumbs up
2371000	2373000	is it Gigi Allen?
2373000	2375000	what the fuck are you watching?
2375000	2377000	this is somebody you're still friends with
2377000	2379000	I will only say one thing
2379000	2381000	about this, this is the weird thing
2381000	2383000	if you ever see the video
2383000	2385000	his poop is
2385000	2387000	it's a video
2387000	2389000	he pulls a poop out of his butt
2389000	2391000	and puts it on his face
2391000	2393000	after he congratulated
2393000	2395000	somebody on their engagement
2396000	2398000	I think it's important
2398000	2400000	to note that his poop
2400000	2402000	in that particular video
2402000	2404000	and I know I'll describe this
2404000	2406000	that's not possible but it's like
2406000	2408000	it's so healthy looking
2408000	2410000	that it's
2410000	2412000	basically not gross
2412000	2414000	to watch him smear it across his face
2414000	2416000	it looks like
2416000	2418000	how you would imagine
2418000	2420000	a perfectly healthy
2420000	2422000	vowel movement, it's just perfectly textured
2422000	2424000	it's like a clipart of a turd
2425000	2427000	it almost looks comfortable
2427000	2429000	he clearly enjoys doing it
2429000	2431000	tell me again how you came
2431000	2433000	about this video clip
2433000	2435000	Cody's old roommate
2435000	2437000	ran into some strangers
2437000	2439000	she got the video from them
2439000	2441000	they were affiliated with this wedding
2441000	2443000	engagement that someone, one of the
2443000	2445000	guests or something had tapped this fellow
2445000	2447000	you're three steps away from an actual
2447000	2449000	human being, this is not just random
2449000	2450000	internet stuff
2450000	2452000	so we tracked him down to the Rick and Morty
2452000	2454000	we were looking around for this guy and somebody found him
2454000	2456000	his name is Naked Martin
2456000	2458000	what I kept trying to figure out
2458000	2460000	and he's a very sweet-seeming fella
2460000	2462000	no
2462000	2464000	no, I'm telling
2464000	2466000	don't do it
2466000	2468000	don't try to sell us this dude, please
2468000	2470000	let's not go out like this dad
2470000	2472000	he's a super pleasant guy
2472000	2474000	not like this
2474000	2476000	his bio is like I'm Naked Martin
2476000	2478000	I'm a nudist that loves to have fun
2478000	2480000	white poop on his face
2480000	2482000	but it's so healthy this poop
2482000	2484000	you gotta understand
2484000	2486000	how healthy
2486000	2488000	does a poop have to look to
2488000	2490000	you can buy coffee mugs
2490000	2492000	and you can also get
2492000	2494000	a video if you want
2494000	2496000	me undies is gonna be so mad about this
2496000	2498000	promotion
2498000	2500000	so then Cody
2500000	2502000	she eventually, unbeknownst to me
2502000	2504000	she orders a video from Naked Martin
2504000	2506000	and it was
2506000	2508000	gonna be for the anniversary
2508000	2510000	oh, you can't play the video but you can play the audio
2510000	2512000	why can't you play the video?
2512000	2514000	I can, but
2514000	2516000	I just don't know if playing the audio
2516000	2518000	is really that
2518000	2520000	important versus the amount of time it's gonna spend
2520000	2522000	I agree, it's your show
2522000	2524000	stop doing things
2524000	2526000	are all of his clips
2526000	2528000	him pooping on things?
2528000	2530000	no
2530000	2532000	we were trying to figure that out
2532000	2534000	does this guy, it's all about
2534000	2536000	Naked Martin and nudity
2536000	2538000	his logo
2538000	2540000	it looks like the logo
2540000	2542000	is written in shit
2542000	2544000	yes, it is
2544000	2546000	but it also could be hot dogs
2546000	2548000	no
2548000	2550000	he didn't smear hot dogs on his face
2550000	2552000	hot dogs are, no
2552000	2554000	no no, turds
2554000	2556000	turds, there's turds
2556000	2558000	why don't you know the difference between
2558000	2560000	hot dogs and shit?
2560000	2562000	how did that happen?
2562000	2564000	I think it's possible for a graphic designer
2564000	2566000	I'd like to give a special shout out to people that
2566000	2568000	traveled here to see this final show
2568000	2570000	okay, well, here's the thing
2570000	2572000	keep going, talking about
2572000	2574000	the video
2574000	2576000	I want so badly to just
2576000	2578000	hand it off to Jeff now
2578000	2580000	no, no, let's import this immediately
2580000	2582000	oh, you have questions about this guy
2582000	2584000	I have a hundred questions
2584000	2586000	even though we're doing a show
2590000	2592000	my first question is, what was
2592000	2594000	the origin story of you finding this person
2594000	2596000	and how did this become a part of your life?
2596000	2598000	uh, so you're interested
2598000	2600000	yes, okay
2600000	2602000	oh, I'm in
2602000	2604000	so, uh
2604000	2606000	uh, the uh
2606000	2608000	Cody comes up to me a
2608000	2610000	like a month later, a couple weeks later
2610000	2612000	and she's kind of sadly, she goes
2612000	2614000	like, I was gonna, I got something for
2614000	2616000	our engagement, which is not until
2616000	2618000	Christmas time, our anniversary
2618000	2620000	for our engagement, but it didn't go
2620000	2622000	as well as I thought it would
2622000	2624000	and so I'm just gonna give it
2624000	2626000	to you now
2626000	2628000	and it's, and it's Naked Martin
2628000	2630000	uh, sitting in,
2630000	2632000	kneeling in a kitchen
2632000	2634000	everything about the video, it's like
2634000	2636000	the first one, I gotta go back and describe
2636000	2638000	the first one, because it's like
2638000	2640000	he's out in, like, a beautiful
2640000	2642000	lush, daylit garden
2642000	2644000	like, all you can see behind him is
2644000	2646000	just foliage, like
2646000	2648000	and he's just, he's very chipper and
2648000	2650000	crisp, and the video, and as I described
2650000	2652000	like, from the texture of the shit
2652000	2654000	to his deployment of it
2654000	2656000	everything is just sort of like
2656000	2658000	it looks as if he's done it a thousand times
2658000	2660000	he's smiling, he's glowing
2660000	2662000	and uh
2662000	2664000	and it's his own poop, he
2664000	2666000	poops, and then he does his own
2666000	2668000	he's mad at his ass
2668000	2670000	no, he reaches between his naked
2670000	2672000	legs, where he's cleverly
2672000	2674000	releasing a
2674000	2676000	bag of someone else's shit
2676000	2678000	because
2678000	2680000	because he wants to save himself a
2680000	2682000	gross and tedious task
2682000	2684000	of withdrawing his own, yes, I think it's his own
2684000	2686000	shit, but, um, I'm
2686000	2688000	trying to think what's worse, his own poop
2688000	2690000	or somebody else's poop
2690000	2692000	but it is notable that it's all so cleanly
2692000	2694000	done in that first video, that it, that is a
2694000	2696000	question that comes to your mind, is like
2696000	2698000	is that really, can you just do
2698000	2700000	that, can you just reach back there and like a
2700000	2702000	rabbit from a hat, like it's just
2702000	2704000	in one piece, like there's nothing
2704000	2706000	gross about it, it's because, I think
2706000	2708000	why is there nothing
2708000	2710000	gross
2710000	2712000	about it? It's shocking, but it's
2712000	2714000	not, I think you'll find
2714000	2716000	stuff with
2716000	2718000	shit is like
2718000	2720000	it's the details, it's the
2720000	2722000	sloppy organic details, that's
2722000	2724000	what we don't like about shit, it's
2724000	2726000	like chaos, and it's like everything
2726000	2728000	that life is done with
2728000	2730000	and as such it behaves
2730000	2732000	in no predictable way and things, and then
2732000	2734000	when you draw like a cartoon turd,
2734000	2736000	you can, you don't like, most people don't
2736000	2738000	like react to a drawing of
2738000	2740000	a turd that looks like a little Hershey's kiss with
2740000	2742000	stink lines coming off of it, it's like, we
2742000	2744000	don't gag because it makes us think of real
2744000	2746000	shit, like, but anyway, so
2746000	2748000	like, I'm telling you the guy's turd
2748000	2750000	was a cartoon, so then
2750000	2752000	Cody's video, so it's like
2752000	2754000	he says, uh
2754000	2756000	he's kneeling in a kitchen, so it's
2756000	2758000	already like, ugh, just, why is he
2758000	2760000	kneeling, and uh
2761000	2763000	and there's like, there's like saucepans
2763000	2765000	hanging from a, do we know, do we know it's his
2765000	2767000	kitchen, or is he in somebody else's kitchen? I hope
2767000	2769000	that he gets so many of these videos ordered
2769000	2771000	that every weekend he rents a B&B
2771000	2773000	and knocks them all out
2773000	2775000	and just
2775000	2777000	leaves a $500 tip
2777000	2779000	for the cleaning staff
2779000	2781000	and just walks away the happiest guy in the world,
2781000	2783000	I really am telling you, if you see this guy's bio, you're
2783000	2785000	gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna, you're gonna love
2785000	2787000	this guy, he's like, he represents
2787000	2789000	all that is, like,
2789000	2791000	assuming and purely, he's hurting
2791000	2793000	nobody, um, and there's
2793000	2795000	not enough people like him in the world, there I said it
2795000	2797000	but, but what
2797000	2799000	I could never figure out is, like, well does he
2799000	2801000	love, does he love the shit stuff, or is that
2801000	2803000	what people are, like, requesting
2803000	2805000	because he says, like, I'll do anything
2805000	2807000	and then are people like, rub shit
2807000	2809000	on your face, and he's like, well I'll
2809000	2811000	do that too, or is he like,
2811000	2813000	I love shit, like you can't see anything at his site
2813000	2815000	about, like, shit play, but then
2815000	2817000	so then Cody ordered this video
2817000	2819000	and it says, uh, he goes,
2819000	2821000	uh, he's kneeling in the kitchen and he says, Dan
2821000	2823000	it's been one year since
2823000	2825000	you said yes to Cody proposing to you
2825000	2827000	and she just wants you to know
2827000	2829000	that she thinks you're the shit
2829000	2831000	and
2831000	2833000	what
2833000	2835000	and, and Cody did not ask him to do
2835000	2837000	this part, but he now turns around
2837000	2839000	oh!
2839000	2841000	and, uh, this is definitely his shit
2841000	2843000	oh look, it's, uh, it's Jesse
2843000	2845000	Jesse Camp? What's up Jesse? Yeah
2845000	2847000	wait, wait, so, so she commissioned
2847000	2849000	this guy, yeah, so he
2849000	2851000	she commissioned his shit to be taken
2851000	2853000	he turns around on his knees
2853000	2855000	and then starts to do the same thing he did
2855000	2857000	but now it's a completely different
2857000	2859000	view, it's no longer a mystery
2859000	2861000	right, and it's, and the rabbit
2861000	2863000	does not just come out of
2863000	2865000	a hat, like, there's a
2865000	2867000	there's a piece of rabbit that falls on the
2867000	2869000	the hardwood floor
2869000	2871000	with an audible kind of
2871000	2873000	sound
2873000	2875000	and then he turns back around with
2875000	2877000	his shit now in his hand and he
2877000	2879000	Cody had asked
2879000	2881000	him, she was really sad, that's why she just
2881000	2883000	she just waved the white flag and gave it to
2883000	2885000	me a month early, cause it's like
2885000	2887000	she, she's like, he's
2887000	2889000	I was like, what is he doing?
2889000	2891000	he's, he's supposed to be
2891000	2893000	a heart, he's trying to
2893000	2895000	oh no!
2895000	2897000	no!
2897000	2899000	he's like trying to draw a heart on his chest
2899000	2901000	with his own poop?
2901000	2903000	circle, and it's just like there's so
2903000	2905000	much texture to the chest hair
2905000	2907000	and so
2907000	2909000	and then
2909000	2911000	and then he gives a thumbs up
2911000	2913000	and then he presses a button
2913000	2915000	on something next to him
2915000	2917000	that is apparently supposed to stop the video
2917000	2919000	and then there's like an eight second pause
2919000	2921000	and then he
2921000	2923000	and then he kind of does a couple false starts
2923000	2925000	and then he starts
2925000	2927000	and then the video ends, so the whole thing
2927000	2929000	is just sort of like, you're just like
2929000	2931000	I mean, I hope he's happy
2931000	2933000	yeah, yeah
2933000	2935000	I want to think that he's living the best life
2935000	2937000	how much did Cody pay him for this?
2937000	2939000	is this a commission?
2939000	2941000	eighty pounds, which is a hundred and three
2941000	2943000	American dollars. That's not enough money
2943000	2945000	no, it's not, it is not
2945000	2947000	that's the thing that makes me assume that he likes it
2947000	2949000	or I think it might be a little bit too much money
2949000	2951000	he should be charging
2951000	2953000	a thousand dollars, minimum
2953000	2955000	it costs a hundred dollars to clean that
2955000	2957000	shit up, man
2957000	2959000	it costs a hundred dollars
2959000	2961000	to clean that
2961000	2963000	shit up
2963000	2965000	that's what gives me
2965000	2967000	the hope that I think
2967000	2969000	he must be enjoying it
2969000	2971000	because otherwise he charged
2971000	2973000	fifty thousand dollars like we would, right?
2973000	2975000	how much would we charge
2975000	2977000	to rub our own shit out of us?
2977000	2979000	Mike Eagle, how much would you charge for that?
2979000	2981000	what's your base rate?
2981000	2983000	I had to do it and I had to make a video of it
2983000	2985000	base rate
2985000	2987000	video format that could be fucking shown to anybody
2987000	2989000	yeah, you could be naked
2989000	2991000	Mike Eagle for now on
2991000	2993000	naked shit rubbing Mike Eagle
2993000	2995000	seventy four million dollars
2995000	2997000	see, that's a guy
2997000	2999000	that's like, yeah, cause you're
2999000	3001000	like I said, when you do what you love
3001000	3003000	you don't have to work a day in your life
3003000	3005000	and you're like, your goal
3005000	3007000	as is mine is like
3007000	3009000	there's no price you could put on your
3009000	3011000	ability to be open mic and do what you
3011000	3013000	want, it would need
3013000	3015000	to be so much money for you to
3015000	3017000	shatter that all
3017000	3019000	that you'd have to be set up
3019000	3021000	for life
3021000	3023000	yeah, and if you did anything for ten thousand
3023000	3025000	hours, you'd become an expert at it
3025000	3027000	yeah
3027000	3029000	you should be paid for expertise
3029000	3031000	yeah, he references a thing
3031000	3033000	on his website about coming out
3033000	3035000	why seventy four million, that's a weird specific number
3035000	3037000	it's the highest number I could make with my mouth
3037000	3039000	right now
3039000	3041000	I think
3041000	3043000	I feel that, I've actually riffed
3043000	3045000	that number once, I think on this stage
3045000	3047000	or I might have said a hundred and seventy five
3047000	3049000	but it's like, seventy five
3049000	3051000	it's like got the most syllables or something
3051000	3053000	seventy five million, to me it feels like
3053000	3055000	that amount of money, you could
3055000	3057000	even if you
3057000	3059000	weren't a financial wizard, you could
3059000	3061000	figure out a way to live off of interest
3061000	3063000	that's like
3063000	3065000	maybe you have the small house
3065000	3067000	in Sherman Oaks, but you're like
3067000	3069000	only, I just put the seventy five million
3069000	3071000	on a pile, and the pile just radiates
3071000	3073000	money that I live off of every day
3073000	3075000	I probably wouldn't do that, I'd probably
3075000	3077000	buy a dumb fucking gold boat that sank
3077000	3079000	but then you gotta
3079000	3081000	my gold boat!
3081000	3083000	then you gotta make another shit video
3083000	3085000	I made a gold boat
3085000	3087000	yeah, you gotta get on that
3087000	3089000	shit video money
3089000	3091000	oh, one more detail, is that
3091000	3093000	Cody, she gave him a shout out
3093000	3095000	or whatever, she showed like a frame grab
3095000	3097000	or something like that on her Instagram
3097000	3099000	he messaged her and said
3099000	3101000	thanks for the shout out, like he was
3101000	3103000	appreciative of her getting the word out
3103000	3105000	lest anybody think, for some reason, that a guy
3105000	3107000	that sells this service wants to keep it
3107000	3109000	on the down low
3109000	3111000	and is somehow going to be hampered by this
3111000	3113000	getting out
3113000	3115000	you know how much shit is on his phone screen?
3115000	3117000	it's just shit particles all over his
3117000	3119000	fucking phone screen
3119000	3121000	I'm telling you
3121000	3123000	I feel bad that this is
3123000	3125000	the last episode because
3125000	3127000	in episode 361, there
3127000	3129000	would be a lot of people coming back
3129000	3131000	on the show to say, I can't believe
3131000	3133000	it but you're right, he seems
3133000	3135000	fastidious and pleasant and I'm
3135000	3137000	in his, I'm rooting for him
3137000	3139000	he seems like a wonderful man
3139000	3141000	that I want to be happy
3141000	3143000	Levi just came out and showed me a clip
3143000	3145000	if that's his flaccid dick, it's a
3145000	3147000	pretty good side
3147000	3149000	it's a big dick
3149000	3151000	yeah, his
3151000	3153000	willingness to be nude, I get
3156000	3158000	he probably does that for free
3158000	3160000	but why the poop?
3160000	3162000	my friends that were in the band
3162000	3163000	you're talking about it
3163000	3165000	my friends, I grew up with
3165000	3167000	there's a band called Kroms, a CRM
3167000	3169000	with an umlaut for no reason
3169000	3171000	and they're like a grindcore
3171000	3173000	death metal band
3173000	3175000	and, you know Krom?
3175000	3177000	oh fuck, one person, that's awesome
3177000	3179000	yeah
3179000	3181000	they would throw these parties
3181000	3183000	and they had a DVD
3183000	3185000	a VHS tape
3185000	3187000	and it said 666, do not watch
3187000	3189000	on it
3189000	3191000	and it was a poop video
3191000	3193000	and if you watched it, you
3193000	3195000	barfed
3195000	3197000	it was the most volatile
3197000	3199000	thing I've ever seen and it was a guy
3199000	3201000	it was not black and white
3201000	3203000	but the color was so bad it was almost

3233000	3235000	Conan the Barbarian's god
3235000	3237000	and so one of their
3237000	3239000	song was Fuck You, Woodpusher
3239000	3241000	they pushed a stick around
3241000	3243000	and there was Grace
3243000	3245000	don't you say nothing
3245000	3247000	one song is called Grace Jones Headbutt
3247000	3249000	oh Grace Jones Headbutt, yeah, Grace Jones Headbutt

3263000	3265000	one of the guys in the band's name, Will
3265000	3267000	and his name was the Will of Krom
3267000	3269000	he was the god and these motherfuckers
3269000	3271000	did every drug and
3271000	3273000	there was a VHS tape
3273000	3275000	666, 666
3275000	3277000	do not watch

3279000	3281000	oh I'm gonna put that on
3281000	3283000	and there was a dude
3283000	3285000	bent over on all fours
3285000	3287000	and a girl
3287000	3289000	next to his butt
3289000	3291000	yes
3291000	3293000	and he started
3293000	3295000	he started to poop
3295000	3297000	and she ate it up like it was like
3297000	3299000	soft serve ice cream
3299000	3301000	uh

3319000	3321000	blood sugar laughs
3321000	3323000	I mean
3323000	3325000	long story short, she looks
3325000	3327000	pretty unhappy and
3327000	3329000	you watch four seconds
3329000	3331000	of that and you have to walk outside and vomit
3331000	3333000	and yet there's
3333000	3335000	an audience for that sort of stuff
3335000	3337000	and you found it and now you and Cody share
3337000	3339000	that with you
3339000	3341000	I believe I've seen that video or one like it
3341000	3343000	and I remember physically gagging because it is
3343000	3345000	the site of the thing that makes you rest
3345000	3347000	here's the bummer
3347000	3349000	uh
3349000	3351000	here's the thing
3351000	3353000	here's where it gets
3353000	3355000	troublesome
3355000	3357000	if you're Canadian or
3357000	3359000	UK
3359000	3361000	the real sad part is that
3361000	3363000	they don't like it
3363000	3365000	if they were injured
3365000	3367000	okay these people like to party
3367000	3369000	that's the thing
3369000	3371000	but this guy

3385000	3387000	there was all sadness but then
3387000	3389000	I'm really embarrassed
3389000	3391000	they go back at it and they do it again
3391000	3393000	come on you guys
3393000	3395000	you watched all that I do?

3399000	3401000	uh
3401000	3403000	who likes to party?
3403000	3405000	I would say that
3405000	3407000	this clip had third act troubles
3407000	3409000	laughs
3409000	3411000	laughs
3411000	3413000	I think the third act kind of broke down
3413000	3415000	uh
3415000	3417000	don't watch a poop video
3417000	3419000	on that same VHS tape
3419000	3421000	is there then a
3421000	3423000	like little person
3423000	3425000	no okay
3425000	3427000	do you know what I'm talking about?
3427000	3429000	that was a tape you had
3429000	3431000	yeah that was a tape that I had
3431000	3433000	okay
3433000	3435000	it was just like
3435000	3437000	I started to feel like
3437000	3439000	I was a bad person
3439000	3441000	we were watching a tape that was just
3441000	3443000	started off as public access stuff
3443000	3445000	that just got weirder and weirder
3445000	3447000	and more and more degraded as clips
3447000	3449000	were like bad stand up auditions
3449000	3451000	and then all of a sudden it turns into
3451000	3453000	black and white
3453000	3455000	and there was a little person
3455000	3457000	dressed up in makeup
3457000	3459000	and a dress and doing like tap dancing
3459000	3461000	and it was really
3461000	3463000	but on the same
3463000	3465000	I was trying to
3465000	3467000	I was trying to triangulate a tape
3467000	3469000	that I recall having
3469000	3471000	discussed in like
3471000	3473000	I've never watched a poop video with you two
3473000	3475000	I was a separate poop
3475000	3477000	I'm starting to feel like y'all are the police
3477000	3479000	and this is a lie you're telling me to get me to confess to something
3479000	3481000	laughs
3481000	3483000	yeah
3483000	3485000	I didn't fucking do it okay
3485000	3487000	laughs
3487000	3489000	laughs
3489000	3491000	no you ate the poop now come on
3491000	3493000	laughs
3493000	3495000	moving on
3495000	3497000	fingerprints around the toilet bowl
3497000	3499000	I was playing
3499000	3501000	Cody
3501000	3503000	my niece to be
3503000	3505000	my common law niece
3505000	3507000	what is she three
3507000	3509000	I think she's three now
3509000	3511000	absolutely
3511000	3513000	adorable
3513000	3515000	common law niece
3515000	3517000	we haven't set a date for our wedding
3517000	3519000	she's as good as my niece
3519000	3521000	and
3521000	3523000	it's weird
3523000	3525000	I don't know how to describe her title
3525000	3527000	so I just keep going like my niece to be
3527000	3529000	laughs
3529000	3531000	pre-niece
3531000	3533000	she calls me uncle
3533000	3535000	yeah
3535000	3537000	laughs
3537000	3539000	but
3539000	3541000	we were playing with her
3541000	3543000	me and Cody
3543000	3545000	a couple nights ago
3545000	3547000	and then
3547000	3549000	I was in like a make believe kind of game
3549000	3551000	about how Cody's
3551000	3553000	sick and she's
3553000	3555000	a doctor but she was like
3555000	3557000	it was just
3557000	3559000	such a weird
3559000	3561000	cause she kept
3561000	3563000	Cody and I were brother and sister
3563000	3565000	and
3565000	3567000	little three year old Maya was
3567000	3569000	calling her, she was acting as
3569000	3571000	the doctor that was taking care of Cody
3571000	3573000	but she was also both our
3573000	3575000	daddy and our mommy
3575000	3577000	and she kept sending me to school
3577000	3579000	and it was really weird
3579000	3581000	because she had all of these
3581000	3583000	she was like
3583000	3585000	she had no patience for
3585000	3587000	any kind of like
3587000	3589000	she was like guess what
3589000	3591000	to Cody, she's like
3591000	3593000	you're really sick
3593000	3595000	you're really sick and then she'd look at me and go like
3595000	3597000	you gotta go to school
3597000	3599000	and then I go like
3599000	3601000	okay I'm gonna go to school
3601000	3603000	and she's like okay now you're at school
3603000	3605000	and it's over there and I'd sit
3605000	3607000	in the corner and then she's like
3607000	3609000	learn your ABCs, you're really sick
3609000	3611000	and then
3611000	3613000	she's like okay school's over
3613000	3615000	I was like I just got here
3615000	3617000	and then I'd come back
3617000	3619000	and it was just like this weird
3619000	3621000	cycle, like this weird simulator
3621000	3623000	that was being run by this three year old
3623000	3625000	who doesn't understand
3625000	3627000	any rules about
3627000	3629000	timing, overkill, sadism
3629000	3631000	munchausen by
3631000	3633000	proxy syndrome which was a
3633000	3635000	big theme because she kept
3635000	3637000	making Cody sicker and sicker
3637000	3639000	and she was
3639000	3641000	she was
3641000	3643000	she gradually
3643000	3645000	kept escalating in terms of the empathy
3645000	3647000	that she was having for Cody
3647000	3649000	the game she wanted to play was
3649000	3651000	she was like it's okay
3651000	3653000	and Cody was like oh I feel
3653000	3655000	I'm sick
3655000	3657000	and then she was like finally
3657000	3659000	after like five iterations of
3659000	3661000	my weird life where I am
3661000	3663000	as I kept commenting
3663000	3665000	I'm like I feel like I'm wasting
3665000	3667000	the better
3667000	3669000	parts of my life while my sister's at
3669000	3671000	home dying
3671000	3673000	I'm learning the ABCs
3673000	3675000	and my teacher's
3675000	3677000	three so like half of the
3677000	3679000	alphabet is QRS
3679000	3681000	she's like AB QRS
3681000	3683000	TV I put W QRS
3683000	3685000	I mean she's
3685000	3687000	whoop whoop
3687000	3689000	but it's her curriculum
3689000	3691000	it's a school district
3691000	3693000	with one student and the school
3693000	3695000	day is ten seconds long
3695000	3697000	after five iterations
3697000	3699000	we come back to the bed which is our
3699000	3701000	house and
3701000	3703000	and Maya looks at Cody and goes
3703000	3705000	hey guess what
3705000	3707000	Cody's like you're dying
3707000	3709000	oh no
3709000	3711000	you're gonna die
3711000	3713000	and Cody's like oh no
3713000	3715000	does that mean I can stop
3715000	3717000	going to school
3717000	3719000	and she goes
3719000	3721000	yeah
3721000	3723000	she's dying so you stay home from school
3723000	3725000	and then she like
3725000	3727000	she nurses Cody through she's like
3727000	3729000	it's okay it's alright
3729000	3731000	it's gonna be okay
3731000	3733000	and then Cody died
3733000	3735000	she goes guess what
3735000	3737000	you're dead
3737000	3739000	so then Cody said
3739000	3741000	she killed Cody?
3741000	3743000	and then I was like wow
3744000	3746000	mortician
3746000	3748000	I don't know what I'm now allowed
3748000	3750000	I don't know if her parents would be like
3750000	3752000	you taught her about death
3752000	3754000	she thinks that's
3754000	3756000	sleeping now I don't know
3756000	3758000	and then she's like let's give her some more
3758000	3760000	medicine
3760000	3762000	she's like
3762000	3764000	lotion because it's a hotel room
3764000	3766000	puts lotion on Cody's forehead that's like
3766000	3768000	medicine for dying
3768000	3770000	and Cody
3770000	3772000	blinks her eyes and goes like
3772000	3774000	I'm alive I'm alive
3774000	3776000	and Maya goes hey guess what
3776000	3778000	what you have to go to school
3788000	3790000	it's pretty fun
3790000	3792000	is she a good person or a bad person?
3792000	3794000	I don't know
3794000	3796000	I don't actually believe
3796000	3798000	that human beings have a moral
3798000	3800000	conscience I believe that we
3800000	3802000	get like
3802000	3804000	the motivation to say
3804000	3806000	you're dying or you're sick
3806000	3808000	did she go through something?
3808000	3810000	well I don't know
3810000	3812000	I'm not a good enough uncle to know
3812000	3814000	if maybe she lost a goldfish
3814000	3816000	somewhere between all the peppa pigs
3816000	3818000	and the movies
3818000	3820000	that her parents are watching
3820000	3822000	or all the other kids in kindergarten
3822000	3824000	it's like you're picking up on our
3824000	3826000	mythology which is about death and life
3826000	3828000	did she watch YouTube?
3829000	3831000	her parents are really good at keeping
3831000	3833000	did she ever take a turd out and start making
3833000	3835000	a heart on somebody's chest?
3839000	3841000	if I was ever going to have a kid
3841000	3843000	it would only be out of the selfish
3843000	3845000	motivation of like what a great
3845000	3847000	audience
3847000	3849000	your bits could be so
3849000	3851000	I got a bit that I do with my
3851000	3853000	nephew that I've been doing
3853000	3855000	for about three years now
3855000	3857000	whenever I see him I go
3857000	3859000	where's my money?
3859000	3861000	and he's like
3861000	3863000	he's like six
3863000	3865000	and he's like I don't know what you're talking about
3865000	3867000	and I go no you said that the last
3867000	3869000	time where's my money
3869000	3871000	and he's like
3871000	3873000	I don't have any money
3873000	3875000	I go you better get my money
3875000	3877000	now
3877000	3879000	and his parents are just like
3879000	3881000	I'm so confused
3881000	3883000	is this a joke?
3883000	3885000	do you ever say the amount or is it just vague?
3885000	3887000	no no no
3889000	3891000	I want my money
3891000	3893000	and for some reason I had
3893000	3895000	a wad of cash
3895000	3897000	in my wallet
3897000	3899000	I had 20s and 1s
3899000	3901000	and I opened it up
3901000	3903000	and I go hey I'm just kidding
3903000	3905000	here let me give it
3905000	3907000	and then I pulled out a receipt
3907000	3909000	can you throw this out for me?

4007000	4009000	final calls will be passed out
4009000	4011000	throughout the audience
4011000	4013000	these people don't know what the fuck the final call is
4013000	4015000	but God love you
4015000	4017000	Google it
4017000	4019000	you guys referenced the five percenters in the
4019000	4021000	oh that was me, I brought it to five percenters
4021000	4023000	because I've been watching the Wu-Tang show on Hulu
4023000	4025000	it's great
4025000	4027000	actually I think it's really bad
4027000	4029000	but I like it a lot
4029000	4031000	I think it's bad
4031000	4033000	I like them
4033000	4035000	so I like seeing all the fantastical stories
4035000	4037000	that didn't really happen
4037000	4039000	in the projects with them
4039000	4041000	but there's a lot of not great acting
4041000	4043000	in it
4043000	4045000	I thought you'd seen it
4045000	4047000	I loved it
4047000	4049000	I thought it was really good
4049000	4051000	you were acting like you hadn't seen it
4051000	4053000	I thought you recommended it to me
4053000	4055000	I thought it was really
4055000	4057000	I know I'm supposed to
4057000	4059000	if you don't really like them
4059000	4061000	you might not really like the show
4061000	4063000	I'm not familiar enough with anybody
4063000	4065000	outside Tori Amos to be like
4065000	4067000	I like them, I don't like them
4067000	4069000	would you watch a Tori Amos, a part of
4069000	4071000	fictional one hour drama on Hulu?
4071000	4073000	fuck yeah he would
4073000	4075000	what would it be called?
4075000	4077000	probably like
4077000	4079000	cabbages in turtles racing
4079000	4081000	people would be like
4081000	4083000	talking about
4083000	4085000	that's my girls
4085000	4087000	hey Spencer
4087000	4089000	hey guys
4089000	4091000	since we're wrapping up the old
4091000	4093000	harmontowns, we found you
4093000	4095000	in a lucky moment
4095000	4097000	what's your feelings about
4097000	4099000	walking away from this?
4099000	4101000	I hate it
4101000	4103000	yeah, I'm sad you guys
4103000	4105000	oh no
4105000	4107000	are you guess what?
4107000	4109000	you're dying
4109000	4111000	I think you're being sarcastic
4111000	4113000	because this isn't very different
4113000	4115000	than you sound when you're ecstatic
4115000	4117000	no, I'm sad
4117000	4119000	I can't tell if you're being
4119000	4121000	for real or you're doing a bit
4121000	4123000	it sucks you guys
4123000	4125000	I think he's being for real
4125000	4127000	it's true
4127000	4129000	I'm being honest
4129000	4131000	it feels like
4131000	4133000	only yesterday that you
4133000	4135000	raised your hand when Dan asked
4135000	4137000	is anybody here a dungeon master
4137000	4139000	and you raised your hand and here we
4139000	4141000	are after all these years
4141000	4143000	it really does feel like yesterday
4143000	4145000	am I ever going to see you again?
4145000	4147000	no
4147000	4149000	I mean here's the thing
4149000	4151000	I don't know if I'm ever going to see any of you guys
4151000	4153000	ever again
4153000	4155000	this is my way of hanging out with you
4155000	4157000	well Spencer and I, we don't have the name
4157000	4159000	of it yet, we don't know exactly when
4159000	4161000	and where and what, but we have a venue
4161000	4163000	and Spencer and I
4163000	4165000	we have a venue?
4165000	4167000	is it?
4167000	4169000	I'll drop it
4169000	4171000	follow us, Spencer and I
4171000	4173000	it's going to be like
4173000	4175000	we're going to make a new podcast
4175000	4177000	and you guys are all welcome to come to
4177000	4179000	Dan
4179000	4181000	you'll be promoting it at the Mexican place
4181000	4183000	next door
4183000	4185000	which I hope is not your venue because they're very rarely open
4185000	4187000	no, no, it is odd
4187000	4189000	I would have learned their name
4189000	4191000	it's a very show busy place, it's going to be groovy
4191000	4193000	it might be monthly, it might not be weekly
4193000	4195000	but we'll make it good and you guys
4195000	4197000	can all come and
4197000	4199000	I would like to request that it be all commercials
4199000	4201000	because the thing that I regret most
4201000	4203000	about ending this podcast is the commercials
4203000	4205000	that's what I'm going to miss the most
4205000	4207000	is doing ads with Spencer is the fucking best part of the thing
4207000	4209000	Church and Spencer doing the commercials
4209000	4211000	is the fucking greatest thing
4211000	4213000	yeah, it's too bad that it would be impossible
4213000	4215000	for us to continue to do that in any capacity
4215000	4217000	but what we do have to do
4217000	4219000	no matter where we go, we have to seal this desk
4219000	4221000	from a dentistry typewriter
4221000	4223000	sit there with your hand on your head
4223000	4225000	why the hand on the head thing, what's this posture?
4225000	4227000	the answer to that question
4227000	4229000	all questions can be revealed
4229000	4231000	on the new podcast
4231000	4233000	no, I did
4233000	4235000	I wrote a D&D module though that people should
4235000	4237000	whoa
4237000	4239000	it's called
4239000	4241000	Color of Chaos and it's on
4241000	4243000	DM's Guild
4243000	4245000	what if we just call it town
4245000	4247000	there's nobody's name involved
4247000	4249000	it's just town
4249000	4251000	the thing that I said on air before
4251000	4253000	yes, exactly
4253000	4255000	I'm just trying to remind everybody
4255000	4257000	no, I know, I know, it's a good thing
4257000	4259000	it's happening already
4259000	4261000	all I'm saying is that buy my module
4261000	4263000	buy your module?
4263000	4265000	give me money
4265000	4267000	that's the only reason I'm here
4267000	4269000	I don't care about any of you fucks
4269000	4271000	I'm just here for the fucking money
4271000	4273000	I want my money
4273000	4275000	love an honest man
4275000	4277000	get that money, homie

4291000	4293000	harmontown, to a very special
4293000	4295000	sanctum you carved out with your own
4295000	4297000	mitts without any fucking permission
4297000	4299000	shout out to a
4299000	4301000	international audience of
4301000	4303000	maniacs and beautiful people and spirits
4303000	4305000	that you can hear from across
4305000	4307000	oceans
4307000	4309000	I heard it personally
4309000	4311000	from 3,000 miles away from the
4311000	4313000	rugged hills of Shaolin and Staten Island
4313000	4315000	I wasn't living there, it was a Manhattan situation
4315000	4317000	at the time, but I really did hear
4317000	4319000	Dan and Spencer
4319000	4321000	and Jeff
4321000	4323000	and Shrob
4323000	4325000	and Brandon and Mike Eagle later on
4325000	4327000	but back then Mike Eagle wasn't there yet
4327000	4329000	it's true
4329000	4331000	you could hear something
4331000	4333000	very special
4333000	4335000	whatever you put this on your ear holes
4335000	4337000	and you could count
4337000	4339000	on a certain amount of brotherhood
4339000	4341000	honesty, love
4341000	4343000	friendship that you guys were
4343000	4345000	gracious, brave, and fucking
4345000	4347000	bold enough to put on display
4347000	4349000	yay
4349000	4351000	I would
4351000	4353000	suggest that a lot of us
4353000	4355000	came to know you guys
4355000	4357000	as strange brothers and friends
4357000	4359000	and I would like to say that in the dark
4359000	4361000	times, we have
4361000	4363000	all gone through
4363000	4365000	you guys did a real public
4365000	4367000	and universal and cosmic service
4367000	4369000	by putting out this wonderful life
4369000	4371000	raft that you could see how
4371000	4373000	bright it was with your eyes closed
4373000	4375000	listening real hard, so thank you
4375000	4377000	for that. Thank you Dave
4377000	4379000	yeah
4379000	4381000	and
4381000	4383000	if I could follow up, I've talked to a lot
4383000	4385000	of people that I've met in the drawing
4385000	4387000	room or here or around town
4387000	4389000	a lot of people said that they went through
4389000	4391000	a depression or some kind of mental
4391000	4393000	stuff and for some reason
4393000	4395000	our silly little show
4395000	4397000	was really important to people
4397000	4399000	I've never quite understood that
4399000	4401000	but I've talked to so many people
4401000	4403000	that's the reason why
4403000	4405000	they dig it, they listen to it, they travel
4405000	4407000	all the way out here
4407000	4409000	like clap if you came from way
4409000	4411000	far away, I know there's people from
4411000	4413000	Italy
4413000	4415000	and Spain and Australia and
4415000	4417000	England and all over the map
4417000	4419000	they got Jesse Kemp, Jesse
4419000	4421000	oh man, hey
4421000	4423000	hey listen
4423000	4425000	I can't follow that, that was
4425000	4427000	brilliant, that was brilliant
4427000	4429000	but if I could
4429000	4431000	since this is still a podcast, people
4431000	4433000	can't really see us, can they?
4433000	4435000	I mean there's some
4435000	4437000	cameras, of course I saw a ring
4437000	4439000	doorbell
4439000	4441000	this is true, but
4441000	4443000	you know what, I'm gonna pass this
4443000	4445000	to my assistant Arnold
4445000	4447000	who's a major Harman town
4447000	4449000	freak
4449000	4451000	Arnold is what got me
4451000	4453000	into this and as
4453000	4455000	is Jeff, but Arnold
4455000	4457000	can you say a couple words about
4457000	4459000	Harman town? Give it up for
4459000	4461000	Arnold
4461000	4463000	Arnold, oh my god
4463000	4465000	oh my god, of course I would say
4465000	4467000	something about Harman town
4467000	4469000	let me tell you this
4469000	4471000	a couple of things about
4471000	4473000	Dan Harman, the man likes
4473000	4475000	slacks, the man likes
4475000	4477000	shorts, and the man likes jean shorts
4477000	4479000	and he's very particular about his
4479000	4481000	cut of jean shorts
4481000	4483000	let's give it up for Arnold everybody
4483000	4485000	Arnold
4485000	4487000	all right
4487000	4489000	these are totally
4489000	4491000	three more minutes
4491000	4493000	no, no, no, no
4493000	4495000	I want to tell
4495000	4497000	you guys something really quickly
4497000	4499000	this is Jesse back again, not Arnold
4499000	4501000	oh darn, where's Arnold?
4501000	4503000	just in case you gotta tell even though
4503000	4505000	I second what Arnold was saying about the jean shorts
4505000	4507000	Dan in the summertime
4507000	4509000	I can't tell you how many times I would come to Harman town
4509000	4511000	here at the Dynasty typewriter just to
4511000	4513000	see Dan in his beautiful
4513000	4515000	summer sack in his summer
4515000	4517000	shorts, I've been talking about
4517000	4519000	Dan in jean shorts
4519000	4521000	is sublime, I mean he starts
4521000	4523000	putting them on around May and well
4523000	4525000	into September he's still wearing jean shorts
4525000	4527000	I'm gonna miss seeing Dan
4527000	4529000	in jean shorts, but
4529000	4531000	let me just say this really quickly
4531000	4533000	I don't want to take up too much time
4533000	4535000	this is like the last cheers
4535000	4537000	this is already
4537000	4539000	a million times better than the last Seinfeld
4539000	4541000	even though I love Seinfeld
4541000	4543000	but I'm gonna say
4543000	4545000	we're going out with a bang
4545000	4547000	I'm gonna tell you that backstage
4547000	4549000	we have a musical tribute
4549000	4551000	Beck is here
4551000	4553000	and if that's not
4553000	4555000	enough
4555000	4557000	we have Willie Nelson here
4557000	4559000	also
4559000	4561000	Woody Harrelson, Matthew McConaughey
4561000	4563000	MC Arnold's gonna be in the house
4563000	4565000	MC Arnold, I don't know if I could do that
4565000	4567000	but
4567000	4569000	you know I'm Arnold
4569000	4571000	you know I'm into jean shorts
4571000	4573000	sue me, but listen
4573000	4575000	I gotta tell you this really quickly
4575000	4577000	two important things and then I'll
4577000	4579000	zip it, but I cannot
4579000	4581000	now that I hijacked this for a minute
4581000	4583000	I can't let you guys out of here without knowing
4583000	4585000	about an amazing project
4585000	4587000	that Dan is launching in March
4587000	4589000	Dan has his very own
4589000	4591000	wine, it's a rose
4591000	4593000	coming out
4593000	4595000	it's called
4595000	4597000	Dan Harmon's
4597000	4599000	Third Testicle
4599000	4601000	now this is a wine like no other
4601000	4603000	wine and let me tell you that
4603000	4605000	up in Dan's Napa
4605000	4607000	Vineyard basically there was a
4607000	4609000	mishap with the Great Crusher
4609000	4611000	and some
4611000	4613000	testosterone got mixed in with the wine
4613000	4615000	so I speak
4615000	4617000	speaking of wine, Ricardo, you hear where you at baby?
4617000	4619000	Ricardo!
4619000	4621000	Ricardo, you brought wine from your hometown
4621000	4623000	outside of Florence, Italy, right?
4623000	4625000	Can you bring it up?
4625000	4627000	It's in the grid role because I can't let it happen
4627000	4629000	Ricardo, please come on stage
4629000	4631000	because
4631000	4633000	when he gets up here
4633000	4635000	give it up for
4635000	4637000	young Italian Steve Coogan
4637000	4639000	Steve Coogan
4639000	4641000	He looks
4641000	4643000	way too much like Steve Coogan
4643000	4645000	What's up Ricardo?
4645000	4647000	Can I sit on your lap?
4647000	4649000	It's the wine
4649000	4651000	Look at this
4651000	4653000	So this is
4653000	4655000	for all of you, but Jeff
4655000	4657000	deeps on it
4657000	4659000	I don't know if it's the best one
4659000	4661000	but it's from my
4661000	4663000	hometown
4663000	4665000	The motherfucker looks like Steve Coogan
4665000	4667000	Look at this guy
4667000	4669000	I just saw
4669000	4671000	What's the movie where the
4671000	4673000	tropics under
4673000	4675000	he looks exactly like Italian Steve Coogan
4675000	4677000	Sure
4677000	4679000	Thank you Ricardo
4679000	4681000	You're welcome
4681000	4683000	Pia Chate
4683000	4685000	Do we have any, because there's all dudes on stage
4685000	4687000	are there any women fans of any
4687000	4689000	old school? What does Arnold have to
4689000	4691000	say about Steve Coogan?
4691000	4693000	Oh my god! I forgot how
4693000	4695000	Arnold talked, but I think that
4695000	4697000	he's even more handsome than
4697000	4699000	an Italian Steve Coogan
4699000	4701000	But I gotta tell you, I mean this wine
4701000	4703000	looks magnificent, it's got a
4703000	4705000	picture of, what would you describe
4705000	4707000	that? A Playboy bunny
4707000	4709000	gone goth
4709000	4711000	Playboy bunny gone goth
4711000	4713000	What's up?
4713000	4715000	This is amazing wine, Ricardo is an amazing
4715000	4717000	man, and I'm just gonna zip it because
4717000	4719000	everyone on this stage is a legend
4719000	4721000	Will Brandon
4721000	4723000	Jeff
4723000	4725000	Rob
4725000	4727000	Dan Spencer
4727000	4729000	and Richard fucking Branson
4729000	4731000	Yeah
4731000	4733000	Right over there, Richard shaved
4733000	4735000	for this event, but
4735000	4737000	fucking no
4737000	4739000	But this is, you thank you Richard
4739000	4741000	Branson for being here, because you reminded me of what
4741000	4743000	I wanted to say, because when I think of Richard Branson
4743000	4745000	I think about
4745000	4747000	Jeff Bezos, and I'm gonna say
4747000	4749000	this, here I think the
4749000	4751000	reason why on planet earth right now
4751000	4753000	we have so much bad shit, and I
4753000	4755000	don't even think we would have climate change depending
4755000	4757000	on this planet if it weren't for
4757000	4759000	tiny penis energy
4759000	4761000	You know what I'm talking about? Let me say
4761000	4763000	this, if Jeff Bezos had a
4763000	4765000	big dick, would he have to own all that money?
4765000	4767000	I don't think so, you know about
4767000	4769000	Jesse, Jesse can I
4769000	4771000	Dan Harmon has always had
4771000	4773000	big dick energy, the world
4773000	4775000	needs more big dick energy
4775000	4777000	and I am scared that once this
4777000	4779000	podcast ends that we're gonna not
4779000	4781000	have as much big dick energy
4781000	4783000	Arnold everybody, Arnold
4783000	4785000	Arnold
4785000	4787000	But final thing out of my
4787000	4789000	mouth, I have a feeling this is not
4789000	4791000	the last Army town ever
4791000	4793000	Shut your ass up while you
4793000	4795000	still talking
4795000	4797000	Please use your lips
4797000	4799000	and just start walking
4799000	4801000	Alright
4801000	4803000	Motherfucker you got to shut your mouth
4805000	4807000	No man
4807000	4809000	Oh yeah
4809000	4811000	No, keep it going Mike
4811000	4813000	I would keep singing but I don't want to do what this
4813000	4815000	motherfucker did
4815000	4817000	No, take up too much
4817000	4819000	time with that bullshit
4819000	4821000	I thought this was just extras
4821000	4823000	that this was gonna be edited out
4823000	4825000	No, no, it's all good
4825000	4827000	They can't edit their lives
4827000	4829000	Oh you're right, you're right, you're right
4829000	4831000	you're right, you're right, you're right
4831000	4833000	you're right, you're right
4833000	4835000	But no, Mike
4835000	4837000	Let's do a song
4837000	4839000	We need some music
4839000	4841000	Jesse
4841000	4843000	You gave him a mic
4843000	4845000	What did you think was gonna happen
4845000	4847000	He's doing everything it's all good
4847000	4849000	He's a microphone, will you stop talking until that
4849000	4851000	You know
4851000	4853000	when this show started I didn't think
4853000	4855000	it would last seven weeks
4855000	4857000	you know
4859000	4861000	Look at us now
4861000	4863000	Do you remember what
4863000	4865000	the very first Harman tone
4865000	4867000	like what you talked about, did you ever
4867000	4869000	when was the last time you listened to the very first Harman tone
4869000	4871000	Well I haven't
4873000	4875000	It was the premise of going to the moon
4875000	4877000	But it started as
4877000	4879000	we weren't podcasting right away
4879000	4881000	and in my memory although we tend to
4881000	4883000	conflate these things but I believe it was like
4883000	4885000	we were doing the Strictly Live
4885000	4887000	and we were recording them just in
4887000	4889000	case
4889000	4891000	and kind of off and on
4891000	4893000	the recording was working and stuff
4893000	4895000	and it was
4895000	4897000	the Chevy Chase thing that kind of
4897000	4899000	was a tipping point because
4899000	4901000	that was a live show
4901000	4903000	that was not
4903000	4905000	a podcast so we were doing the show
4905000	4907000	for a while I think that's what Jeff
4907000	4909000	referenced it was monthly
4909000	4911000	I still had
4911000	4913000	that old school LA
4913000	4915000	kind of
4915000	4917000	perception of like oh there's all these shows
4917000	4919000	in LA where you can go see Harry Dean Stanton
4919000	4921000	play a trombone or Jeff
4921000	4923000	Goldblum like fuck a duck or something
4923000	4925000	and it's not part of their real
4925000	4927000	lives
4927000	4929000	it doesn't end up in T.M.P.
4929000	4931000	Nobody played the bone like Harry Dean
4931000	4933000	But then I made the awful judgmental
4933000	4935000	horrible judgment mistake of like playing
4935000	4937000	Chevy's voicemail into the microphone and somebody was
4937000	4939000	recording it and that was part
4939000	4941000	of the decision to be like okay let's just start
4941000	4943000	podcasting because if anything that'll be a shield
4943000	4945000	because if you
4945000	4947000	kind of like if you
4947000	4949000	want things to be out there
4949000	4951000	then people start to ignore it more
4951000	4953000	it's like well there's
4953000	4955000	five thousand hours of this guy
4959000	4961000	Get that on the mic yeah
4961000	4963000	there you go
4963000	4965000	it all ended
4965000	4967000	I was
4967000	4969000	so excited watching Adam
4969000	4971000	Goldberg's face during Jesse Camp
4971000	4973000	talking because he was like
4973000	4975000	Adam was like I fucking did it I finished first
4977000	4979000	yeah
4979000	4981000	yeah I can't remember what the question was
4981000	4983000	but it was like yeah there was a
4983000	4985000	I don't remember what the first it was the whole moon thing
4985000	4987000	it was just the idea of like alienation
4987000	4989000	and nobody told me to tie my shoes and all that stuff
4989000	4991000	which is like you know
4991000	4993000	that's the thing is like I don't
4993000	4995000	I don't really feel that way anymore
4995000	4997000	I'm not like hey leave me alone
4997000	4999000	don't tell me what to do
4999000	5001000	I'm right about everything everyone else is wrong
5001000	5003000	kind of guy anymore and that's become
5003000	5005000	an actual like
5005000	5007000	view that you can't even really
5007000	5009000	defend even when you do feel that way
5009000	5011000	it's not charismatic anymore
5011000	5013000	and I don't always feel
5013000	5015000	that way but sometimes I do
5015000	5017000	it's just sort of like
5017000	5019000	I don't want to talk in circles
5019000	5021000	but that's part of the thing
5021000	5023000	it's sort of like who the fuck am I
5023000	5025000	it used to be very simple
5025000	5027000	I'm a baby you know
5027000	5029000	I just want to
5029000	5031000	kind of whine and say
5031000	5033000	what about me
5033000	5035000	and it was therapeutic for me
5035000	5037000	so that was the answer
5037000	5039000	the sincere answer to your question
5039000	5041000	when you know
5041000	5043000	they always say if you keep a journal don't go back and read your journal
5043000	5045000	when do you think you'll go back and listen to some of these
5045000	5047000	episodes? I don't know
5047000	5049000	I don't know if I ever would
5049000	5051000	because like
5051000	5053000	I don't know like I don't really
5053000	5055000	if Chris McKenna and I get way
5055000	5057000	drunk enough we'll like
5057000	5059000	maybe we'll like we'll start
5059000	5061000	watching community episodes
5062000	5064000	and we'll get like halfway through
5064000	5066000	the D&D one and then we'll pass out
5066000	5068000	but it's like there's something
5068000	5070000	about revisiting stuff that's like
5070000	5072000	too like I don't know
5072000	5074000	because it's like but you know
5074000	5076000	it's like
5079000	5082000	it's funny that you're holding the wine bottle
5085000	5087000	drink the wine
5087000	5089000	wino del recardo
5090000	5092000	that's not even a that's like he's not even really Italian
5092000	5094000	is he?
5094000	5096000	wino del recardo?
5096000	5098000	that's Spanish
5098000	5099000	alright
5099000	5101000	just kidding that's not what it says
5101000	5103000	this label's in crayon
5103000	5105000	when did you like feel like
5105000	5107000	with harmontown did you like gone
5107000	5109000	yes that was it
5109000	5111000	that's the
5111000	5113000	this is delicious and I love the Tilda Swinton
5113000	5115000	on the label
5115000	5117000	it does say Tilda Swinton
5118000	5120000	sorry
5120000	5122000	it started off with this thing
5122000	5124000	about we're going to colonize the moon
5124000	5126000	and whatever but then eventually I feel like
5126000	5129000	you hit like a stride of
5129000	5132000	this is what a typical harmontown is
5132000	5134000	was it when you were at
5134000	5136000	Meltdown?
5136000	5138000	was it at the castle? was it here?
5138000	5140000	when did you feel like oh okay
5140000	5142000	this is working
5142000	5143000	this is the pattern
5143000	5145000	I don't know I never really felt that way
5145000	5147000	I guess early on at Meltdown
5147000	5149000	I felt like there was a groovy
5149000	5151000	thing going that kind of made
5151000	5153000	a little bit of sense
5153000	5155000	and I think that after Meltdown closed
5155000	5157000	a lot of us
5157000	5159000	in the comedy community
5159000	5161000	lame thing
5161000	5163000	comedy community
5163000	5165000	but a lot of LA comedy people
5165000	5167000	that had performed at Meltdown kind of
5167000	5169000	all of a sudden realized as one does
5169000	5171000	that you know how much
5171000	5173000	of the show
5173000	5175000	was that venue
5175000	5177000	that
5177000	5179000	harmontown was kind of
5179000	5181000	sort of inextricably defined
5181000	5183000	by the wooden pillars in the room
5183000	5185000	and this
5185000	5187000	you know back in those days
5187000	5189000	I was always like god damn it if we could just get rid of these pillars
5189000	5191000	and make this room five times bigger
5191000	5193000	we could put cameras everywhere and then I could show slides
5193000	5195000	of my dog and it was like always driven
5195000	5197000	by this thing
5197000	5199000	there was never a full embrace of the podcast
5199000	5201000	of it all
5201000	5203000	it was just a show
5203000	5205000	that became a podcast and then
5205000	5207000	the other funny transformation that
5207000	5209000	happened is it's so weird
5209000	5211000	to remember this because I can't
5211000	5213000	it's sort of like the way I remember sometimes I smoked a pack and a half
5213000	5215000	a day
5215000	5217000	and then I'm like because someone will say
5217000	5219000	do you mind if I smoke in here and I'll be like
5219000	5221000	yeah I don't care and I'm like holy shit I smoked
5221000	5223000	like a chimney
5223000	5225000	I can't believe this but like
5225000	5227000	originally when we were recording the episodes
5227000	5229000	I would sit with
5229000	5231000	Carl Audio founder Dustin Marshall
5231000	5233000	and we would like I would go over to his house
5233000	5235000	it would book sessions that would last like
5235000	5237000	three or four hours where we'd go
5237000	5239000	through the entire recording and edit
5239000	5241000	the um's and uh's
5241000	5243000	out basically
5243000	5245000	like I was like oh no one wants to listen to somebody
5245000	5247000	like stammer and stutter
5247000	5249000	and say the same thing over and over again
5249000	5251000	when did you stop doing that?
5251000	5253000	I don't remember it's just like we just got exhausted
5253000	5255000	cause I remember yeah you do it
5255000	5257000	and I can totally relate cause I would be like
5257000	5259000	uh I would
5259000	5261000	I would want to do that too but eventually you let go
5261000	5263000	it was not a vanity I assure you
5263000	5265000	it was like that's so strange to think about
5265000	5267000	cause I'm the laziest guy in the world and also
5267000	5269000	the most narcissistic I'd be like yeah
5269000	5271000	listen to me
5271000	5273000	figure it out whatever but like
5273000	5275000	at the time it was like
5275000	5277000	oh that's what you're supposed to do
5277000	5279000	you recorded it live, it's sloppy
5279000	5281000	clean it up or don't put it in people's
5281000	5283000	ears you terrible person like
5283000	5285000	be responsible
5285000	5287000	I'm sure there was
5287000	5289000	just this point where it was like well if I have to
5289000	5291000	keep doing that then I have to stop doing the show
5291000	5293000	because it's too much work it's like
5293000	5295000	the amount of time I need to spend on
5295000	5297000	actual shit
5297000	5299000	but it's just so funny that I would go through the show
5299000	5301000	and go like oh you know
5301000	5303000	I'm being kind of redundant there
5303000	5305000	yeah what was the goal
5305000	5307000	it's such a weird
5307000	5309000	it's crazy to look back
5309000	5311000	like because we
5311000	5313000	just do this kind of silly thing we just come here
5313000	5315000	we don't talk about it the first few episodes
5315000	5317000	I think then like you and I like
5317000	5319000	we'd have a kind of a
5319000	5321000	like a plan like a trajectory that we're going to do
5321000	5323000	and then we gave that up pretty quickly
5323000	5325000	but then like Robin Williams is on the show
5325000	5327000	like and
5327000	5329000	we wrote a song with Erik Eitel
5329000	5331000	and he sang it like
5331000	5333000	some pretty crazy stuff has happened
5333000	5335000	and it really has just been this lazy
5335000	5337000	thing but
5337000	5339000	it makes me very happy
5339000	5341000	and kind of confused
5341000	5343000	that everybody likes it so much
5343000	5345000	so I really want to thank everybody
5345000	5347000	who's like listening or is here tonight
5347000	5349000	who traveled
5349000	5351000	it's pretty crazy
5351000	5353000	it's kind of emotional that you guys
5353000	5355000	all dug it so much so thank you so much
5355000	5357000	I can definitely explain the
5365000	5367000	I definitely understand
5367000	5369000	as a podcast listener
5369000	5371000	it's kind of worth noting
5371000	5373000	that the word podcast is something
5373000	5375000	that in eight years is like a new word
5375000	5377000	and that at the beginning of these eight
5377000	5379000	years this decade that we've just been through
5379000	5381000	I remember being in
5381000	5383000	Erin McGathey's car
5383000	5385000	and her iPod
5385000	5387000	playing
5387000	5389000	this guy started
5389000	5391000	talking about how he and Natasha
5391000	5393000	had just broken up
5393000	5395000	but the podcast was
5395000	5397000	going to continue to be what it was
5397000	5399000	and hey breakups just happened man
5399000	5401000	that's all it's just like look man
5401000	5403000	things just happened and I'm like after like
5403000	5405000	ten minutes of just listening to this guy
5405000	5407000	talk I was like what
5407000	5409000	the fuck is this? It's not a
5409000	5411000	book on tape or radio
5411000	5413000	so what is this? And she's like
5413000	5415000	oh it's Duncan Trussell
5415000	5417000	and he
5417000	5419000	had just broken up with Natasha Leggiero
5419000	5421000	they were doing a podcast together for a while
5421000	5423000	and then he was explaining
5423000	5425000	what was
5425000	5427000	really going on in his life
5427000	5429000	which he would later do
5429000	5431000	as he got diagnosed with cancer as his
5431000	5433000	mother died and
5433000	5435000	Duncan was also I believe the first podcast
5435000	5437000	I was ever on as a guest
5437000	5439000	and I really want to
5439000	5441000	give him a big big shout out
5441000	5443000	because
5443000	5445000	also while you're
5445000	5447000	on that Dan
5447000	5449000	Emily Gordon
5449000	5451000	she's the one that made this happen
5451000	5453000	Emily needs to be
5453000	5455000	she told Dan
5455000	5457000	to have a podcast
5457000	5459000	at Nerd Mountain Meltdown
5459000	5461000	that's why this all started
5461000	5463000	but also like Adam Goldberg
5463000	5465000	and Anatoly and
5465000	5467000	Dave Klein and
5467000	5469000	Vega
5469000	5471000	and all the people that we've met that have come up
5471000	5473000	throughout the years
5473000	5475000	and also I would never have
5475000	5477000	met Spencer Crittenden without
5477000	5479000	the show
5479000	5481000	thank you to me
5481000	5483000	and Chris
5483000	5485000	and Sarah
5485000	5487000	Chris and Sarah
5487000	5489000	I'm going to forget a million names
5489000	5491000	of people that we've just kind of
5491000	5493000	pulled out of the crowd back in the
5493000	5495000	days when we would just say like hey
5495000	5497000	anybody want to come up and talk
5497000	5499000	and we've met a lot of
5499000	5501000	beautiful wonderful people
5501000	5503000	I'm going to get sad
5505000	5507000	Before you

5603000	5605000	tall people
5605000	5607000	Mike I forget
5607000	5609000	What was the connection
5609000	5611000	You met Dan Ware
5611000	5613000	We did Scott Rogowski's show
5613000	5615000	Yeah, we had his live show
5615000	5617000	He used to do the
5617000	5619000	trivia HQ on
5619000	5621000	Apple every day
5621000	5623000	But he had a show called Running Late
5623000	5625000	and I was doing music shit
5625000	5627000	on there and he had Dan on it as a guest
5627000	5629000	and that's when we met
5629000	5631000	Don't we have tapes
5631000	5633000	like Church you got there?
5633000	5635000	In the lobby
5635000	5637000	We got the tapes that you guys did together
5637000	5639000	Yeah, I produced a rap album by
5639000	5641000	Dan
5641000	5643000	and there's tapes of it in the back
5643000	5645000	Also, let's give it up
5645000	5647000	for Church who's been in all the social media
5647000	5649000	and production
5650000	5652000	Yeah

5654000	5656000	to Brendan
5656000	5658000	Church and Brendan are the two
5658000	5660000	that make all the commercials funny
5660000	5662000	and Brendan does all the music
5662000	5664000	and Church is the one that makes it all happen
5664000	5666000	So give it up for if you like the ads
5666000	5668000	it's Brendan and Church

5727000	5729000	I'm doing good
5731000	5733000	You said you're going through some rough shit
5733000	5735000	or should we not talk about that
5735000	5737000	It's kind of a bummer way to end the show right
5737000	5739000	I don't know Jeff
5739000	5742000	Weren't you saying backstage that you had some great news
5742000	5744000	you wanted to share with everybody
5744000	5746000	Just some heartwarming treatment
5750000	5751000	No
5751000	5752000	What?
5752000	5753000	You don't have great news
5753000	5754000	He was lying that you
5754000	5757000	I was just lying, I was just making an ass out of myself
5757000	5759000	in front of my closest friends
5759000	5761000	Hey Levy, what are your like top
5761000	5765000	You got a couple top moments like top three, top two, top one
5767000	5769000	That I've witnessed
5769000	5771000	Or that you haven't
5771000	5773000	Yeah, yeah
5773000	5778000	Oh Dan peeing live on stage
5778000	5779000	Into a diaper
5779000	5781000	Into a diaper in San Francisco
5781000	5782000	I had a fine
5782000	5784000	Dan word depends and peed into his depends
5784000	5787000	It was like 40 minutes before the show and Dan decided
5787000	5790000	What if I pissed live on stage
5790000	5793000	Well that's, come on, that's not how my thought process works
5793000	5794000	I believe that's exactly what happened
5794000	5798000	There was a shit story earlier with another person you admire
5798000	5801000	Exactly, I always approach it with a nuance
5801000	5803000	You peed and you were so happy about it
5803000	5806000	You were really stoked, you were like oh shit, I can just pee wherever I go now
5806000	5811000	It started as this, because somebody had mentioned the people in Times Square
5811000	5813000	when they wear diapers for years
5813000	5814000	I mentioned that
5814000	5816000	That's just peeing in your pants
5816000	5819000	I want to know what these diapers are like
5819000	5820000	They're imposuvio, right?
5820000	5824000	Incredible, you were just like peeing into a portal, it's an advantage
5824000	5826000	It's a whole ass mood
5826000	5829000	Yeah, so I had to run and find a place that had
5829000	5835000	the nicest, best looking adult diapers for Dan to wear on stage
5835000	5839000	Not because I insisted on anything other than adult diapers
5839000	5843000	Apparently you just want me to look good while I'm peeing myself
5843000	5846000	You didn't want the 8K diaper as much as later?
5847000	5849000	But you peed and the look in your pants
5849000	5852000	I didn't say 8K, I was like 8K diaper
5852000	5853000	Oh 8K
5853000	5858000	The look in your face while you were peeing, you were so happy
5858000	5863000	You looked so completely like oh, I can just pee in front of people
5863000	5869000	It's like baby boomers are the first modern generation to get that age
5869000	5873000	where they need diapers and so of course the diapers are now
5873000	5876000	they look like, and the technology behind them
5876000	5881000	I mean we have them to thank for our nation's opioid addiction
5881000	5886000	and like the pills and the diapers are fucking NASA level
5886000	5890000	Because the people that invented the Beatles are shitting themselves
5890000	5893000	and are in fucking pain
5893000	5896000	I can't wait to get older
5896000	5899000	I can't wait to piss just like hanging out
5899000	5900000	How was it pissing on your pants?
5900000	5902000	It was incredible
5902000	5903000	Was it?
5903000	5907000	Yes, because it was like, think about everything you do when you pee
5907000	5910000	You know how men are always kind of like
5910000	5911000	Cry?
5911000	5913000	We kind of like
5913000	5917000	You know, we flaunt with women
5917000	5919000	You know, it's like oh, we're just like
5919000	5922000	It's no problem, you just whip it out
5922000	5925000	I'm out of the bus driver again
5925000	5928000	You whip it out, you're just like whatever
5928000	5931000	and they got a squat and it's more of an ordeal for them
5931000	5934000	to like just pee into a bush or whatever
5934000	5937000	You have no idea how high maintenance what we have to do is
5937000	5942000	until you experience just standing in your pants
5942000	5945000	and doing whatever you want
5945000	5948000	You can play a video game, you can talk to people
5948000	5950000	Have you ever won these ever again?
5950000	5951000	No
5951000	5954000	I mean I don't have to
5954000	5956000	I left the stage a second ago to pee
5956000	5957000	I do wish I could have stayed
5957000	5960000	It would be, it's truly like
5960000	5961000	We've all peed in the shower
5961000	5963000	So you have this experience of like there's water all over you
5963000	5965000	I have never peed in the shower
5965000	5967000	Whoa
5967000	5969000	Sorry
5969000	5971000	I thought we were telling truths of here
5971000	5974000	This from the guy who doesn't like
5974000	5976000	Neil Mike, you've never peed in a shower
5976000	5977000	I've never peed in a shower
5977000	5978000	Is it because you're a gentleman or are you?
5978000	5981000	Because the toilet's right there
5981000	5983000	But peeing in the shower is like
5983000	5984000	From the shower?
5984000	5985000	That's your birthright
5985000	5987000	There's never been a time I guess
5987000	5990000	When I didn't realize I had to pee
5990000	5992000	Until I was in the middle of a shower
5992000	5993000	Because you get in the shower
5993000	5995000	And you got the warm water rolling over you
5995000	5997000	That doesn't make me have to pee
5997000	5999000	It makes me have to pee
5999000	6000000	Okay, well that's just me then
6000000	6002000	Do women have to pee, do women pee in the shower?
6002000	6003000	Yes
6003000	6004000	Okay
6004000	6006000	That was nearly unanimous
6006000	6008000	I think they kind of live for it honestly
6008000	6011000	Which is why men are usually not afraid to admit it
6011000	6013000	Because we've never been shamed by women for peeing in the shower
6013000	6017000	Because women are like the Christopher Columbus of peeing in the shower
6017000	6021000	Women by either like
6021000	6022000	Because it's dark out there
6022000	6023000	By applause
6023000	6026000	Women has never peed in the shower
6026000	6028000	Yeah, give it up
6028000	6029000	A few
6029000	6031000	Now, can I ask one of you why
6031000	6035000	Just because you never had to or you think it's rude
6035000	6037000	It's dirty
6037000	6038000	But you're in the shower?
6038000	6039000	I think
6039000	6040000	And there's soap
6040000	6042000	It's gross, it's probably going to be the answer
6042000	6045000	I don't think people that have never peed in the shower are monsters
6045000	6046000	I don't
6046000	6048000	No, no, I'm just saying
6048000	6051000	I'm not even against it, that just ain't never did it
6051000	6053000	Tonight, you should try it sometime
6053000	6055000	Maybe tomorrow, who knows
6055000	6056000	Hell yeah
6056000	6058000	The night is young, baby
6058000	6060000	Hey everybody
6060000	6062000	Uh oh
6062000	6064000	Throw a beat down, Zach
6064000	6067000	Throw a beat down, Zach, it's a peon song
6067000	6070000	Put a beat on before you get peed on
6070000	6074000	Okay, well, it's me, MC Gun Control
6074000	6076000	Oh, shit, yes
6076000	6077000	Oh, damn
6077000	6078000	MC
6078000	6080000	Give it up for MC Gun Control
6080000	6084000	I can't believe we're here at the final episode of Harm in Town
6084000	6089000	A platform I have used to spread my ambiguous message
6089000	6092000	About gun violence
6092000	6095000	My name, as you know, is MC Gun Control
6095000	6099000	And the bit is you can't tell if I'm for or against it
6099000	6105000	But there's also a part of an added meta bit
6105000	6108000	About how forthright I am about that being my bit
6108000	6111000	Which I personally enjoy
6111000	6117000	Um, but here's a little rap about Gun Control
6117000	6120000	Which is also my name
6120000	6128000	The AK-47 is capable of killing 30,000 lives a second
6129000	6134000	It's the most devastating weapon ever
6134000	6137000	Available in stores
6137000	6145000	Over 50 million handguns are in the houses
6145000	6148000	They're very, very popular
6148000	6150000	Handguns are popular
6150000	6152000	The most popular
6152000	6155000	Even more than blenders
6156000	6159000	I'm MC Gun Control
6159000	6166000	Bullets are lethal
6166000	6169000	Bullets are lethal
6169000	6173000	More lethal than icicles
6173000	6178000	Even if they don't go through your eyeballs
6178000	6182000	Which icicles have to do to be lethal
6182000	6186000	If you throw an icicle at a human
6186000	6188000	They'll get mad at you
6188000	6191000	They'll know what you are
6191000	6193000	They'll know you are far
6193000	6197000	Into the realm of enmity
6197000	6200000	With them, they'll be like
6200000	6203000	Hey, why'd you throw an icicle at me?
6203000	6207000	They'll also probably think you're just throwing ice at them
6207000	6212000	Because the icicle will have broken up in the air
6212000	6216000	By the time it hits them, it'll be cubes
6216000	6221000	They'll think you're just throwing ice at them in winter
6221000	6224000	Guns on the other hand
6224000	6231000	Can kill people regardless of the season or the intention
6231000	6233000	MC Gun Control, y'all
6233000	6234000	Yes, thank you
6234000	6236000	I'm MC Gun Control
6236000	6239000	You know MC Gun Control
6239000	6244000	Mike, did you know guns are responsible for more deaths than cancer, Jeff?
6244000	6245000	I didn't know that
6245000	6247000	Mike, you got a beat? You're looking at your thing
6247000	6249000	That was his beat
6249000	6250000	That was yours
6250000	6252000	Everything was all my fault
6252000	6254000	Let's do one more then
6255000	6257000	Bullshit
6258000	6263000	Hey, I'm MC 8209
6264000	6266000	And I'm not feeling fine
6266000	6270000	You got ten seconds to comply
6270000	6272000	With my rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
6272000	6275000	Yo, beat's old Detroit
6275000	6278000	It's got a cancer called crime, that ain't no joint
6278000	6281000	Yo, I'm the next step in law enforcement
6281000	6285000	Took your bubble so hard, your pussy is engorgent
6285000	6286000	One
6290000	6293000	Sometimes I speak like a Shakespearean actor
6293000	6296000	To make a word rhyme
6297000	6299000	Her pussy was engorgent
6304000	6305000	Roar
6306000	6308000	I can't walk downstairs
6309000	6311000	I roar like a lion
6311000	6314000	I'm stop motion animated but I ain't crying
6314000	6317000	You can't see genie, that won't be reality
6317000	6320000	Because you need the texture to make you feel humanity
6320000	6323000	Coming through the animation giving it character
6323000	6327000	Fuck your mama so hard, I needed an airplane hanger
6328000	6330000	To hold all the jizz
6330000	6332000	Cause that's how fucking is
6332000	6335000	When you're in 209, you do that shit right
6335000	6338000	You never leave a single pussy hanging tight
6338000	6341000	You loosen, okay, you loosen up, okay
6342000	6344000	Yeah
6347000	6352000	Wow, we really heard from all of the old beloved characters
6352000	6358000	If I was a reporter from Vulture doing a retrospective on our podcast
6358000	6360000	I would be extra impressed at this point
6360000	6362000	And I'm sure that article's gonna turn out great
6365000	6367000	But did I mention this already?
6367000	6369000	Paste magazine I think it was
6370000	6372000	Why do they still call them magazines?
6375000	6378000	One of the best podcasts of the decade
6378000	6382000	I think you're kind of cheating when your podcast lasts a decade
6382000	6384000	I mean, it's like a weird thing for a podcast to be so old
6384000	6386000	So we were in there
6386000	6388000	What are we up there with?
6388000	6390000	What are we up there with?
6390000	6392000	I didn't read the article
6392000	6394000	Probably split the table
6394000	6396000	I'm gonna read the Vulture one though
6397000	6399000	This American life is number one, I think
6399000	6400000	Fuck that
6400000	6401000	Well, whatever
6403000	6406000	You know, that's because I had an episode on there
6406000	6407000	Whoa
6407000	6408000	God damn it
6408000	6409000	Way to make it about you
6409000	6411000	Way to make it about you
6411000	6412000	Christ
6412000	6413000	Dan, what's next for you?
6413000	6415000	I always knew I'd end up on this American life
6415000	6417000	Do you want to do another podcast ever again, Dan?
6417000	6418000	Is this it for you?
6418000	6420000	Are you just gonna fuck off straight into the night?
6420000	6421000	No, I'm gonna...
6421000	6424000	No, I think that honestly like
6425000	6426000	It's not a fun answer
6426000	6429000	No, I can't wait to do more stuff
6429000	6433000	I just think that I'm just tired of...
6433000	6436000	I'm tired of acting like I'm a product
6436000	6441000	So I think that that was a fun surfing style for a while
6441000	6445000	And it doesn't make as much sense anymore
6445000	6448000	And everybody matures at different rates
6448000	6450000	And it's like a bingo card
6450000	6452000	You knock out shit at different times
6452000	6454000	Some people are prodigies at shit
6454000	6457000	And then absolute morons at other stuff until they're 70
6457000	6461000	I've never like done like actual just like
6461000	6463000	Hey, I think I'm gonna try to be funny
6463000	6466000	And do a performance and try to make people laugh kind of thing
6466000	6468000	I've always fallen back on the
6468000	6470000	Hey, look at who I am
6470000	6473000	A lot of great people have done that
6473000	6476000	Howard Stern and the like
6476000	6477000	We love that
6477000	6479000	There's a heavy tradition of like
6479000	6481000	That's the old white guy going like
6481000	6483000	Hey, look at me I'm stuck on my thumb
6483000	6487000	But like I am bored with that
6487000	6489000	And feel like also like
6489000	6491000	I would have to double down so much
6491000	6492000	I have a question
6492000	6495000	Can somebody run for mayor of Harmentown?
6495000	6497000	Can somebody run for mayor of Harmentown?
6497000	6499000	A special election?
6499000	6501000	I declare my candidacy
6501000	6505000	For mayor of fucking Harmentown
6505000	6507000	Yes
6508000	6511000	My first act as mayor would be to change the name
6511000	6513000	I second that emotion
6513000	6515000	What if, yeah, what if I can just
6515000	6517000	Mike Eagle just become a mayor of Harmentown
6517000	6518000	Be fucking Eagle Town
6518000	6520000	Eagle Town
6520000	6521000	Shrub
6521000	6523000	Shrub
6523000	6526000	I can make some shit about me for seven years
6526000	6531000	As this town's Obama, I obviously cannot make an endorsement at this stage
6531000	6533000	It would be catastrophic
6533000	6535000	This town's Obama
6537000	6539000	Give me a beat
6540000	6543000	This town's Obama
6543000	6545000	Okay
6545000	6547000	This town's Obama
6547000	6551000	Never gonna fuck a mama
6551000	6554000	Yo, every town's got a zone Obama
6554000	6555000	Obama
6555000	6557000	Chicago
6557000	6558000	Obama
6558000	6559000	Obama
6559000	6560000	Yeah
6560000	6561000	New Orleans
6561000	6562000	Obama
6562000	6564000	Not Obama
6564000	6565000	Nah
6566000	6567000	Obama
6567000	6569000	We can go out of that
6569000	6571000	It's just a list of cities
6573000	6576000	It either is or it isn't Obama
6579000	6580000	Cut a head Wisconsin
6580000	6581000	Not Obama
6581000	6582000	Cut a head
6582000	6584000	It's a different Obama
6585000	6587000	Every town's got an Obama
6587000	6588000	Yeah
6588000	6589000	It's not the same
6589000	6591000	Like my sweaters made of lava
6591000	6592000	Yeah
6592000	6593000	Yeah
6593000	6595000	My sentences with commas so
6595000	6596000	Huh
6596000	6597000	Obama
6602000	6605000	Everybody gotta be their own Obama
6605000	6607000	Be yourself's own Obama
6608000	6610000	Hope and change
6610000	6612000	On the open range
6612000	6614000	Fuck your mama so hard
6614000	6616000	Her labia hang
6617000	6618000	Alright, come on
6618000	6619000	I gotta stop
6619000	6620000	Mike, I'm so sorry
6620000	6621000	No, I know
6621000	6622000	Look, look
6622000	6623000	I never I just
6623000	6624000	Hey, hey
6624000	6626000	I was playing along earlier, right?
6627000	6628000	But I heard the reports
6628000	6629000	I heard what happened after I left
6629000	6630000	Okay
6631000	6632000	I know what happened
6632000	6633000	You know
6633000	6634000	And also we recorded a whole album together
6634000	6635000	So
6635000	6636000	A mama fucking hell
6636000	6639000	We had to make the whole album about fucking mamas
6639000	6640000	Whoa
6640000	6641000	It is a tick
6641000	6642000	It's a rap tick
6642000	6643000	It is
6643000	6644000	And it's like
6644000	6646000	Isn't it weird how you would
6646000	6647000	It's like
6647000	6649000	It's not a rap tick that
6649000	6652000	Saves you it in really any way
6652000	6654000	It saves you though
6654000	6655000	Because you use it
6655000	6656000	You know all these rhymes
6656000	6658000	Well, it's like you
6658000	6659000	Yeah, it's sort of like
6659000	6662000	It's a tick during the setup of a rhyme though
6662000	6664000	Or no, I guess it's not actually
6664000	6665000	It's okay
6665000	6666000	It's in the
6666000	6667000	Because you go like
6667000	6669000	Oh, I went to the store and I bought some milk
6669000	6670000	Then you can go
6670000	6671000	Fuck your mama so hard
6671000	6673000	Because well, you're thinking of the word silk
6673000	6674000	Yes
6674000	6675000	But then you say the silk
6675000	6676000	Right
6676000	6677000	And then you start rhyming about the silk
6677000	6678000	Right
6678000	6679000	So you actually use it
6679000	6681000	Which makes it usable
6681000	6683000	We might have talked about this before
6683000	6684000	But when you're writing
6684000	6687000	Are you just freestyling and putting it on like pen and paper
6687000	6688000	Or like
6688000	6689000	No, I'm writing
6689000	6691000	It's all written
6691000	6692000	I'm making choices
6692000	6693000	Yeah
6697000	6698000	But the writing process
6698000	6699000	You're still
6699000	6701000	Obviously while you're making stuff up
6701000	6702000	And putting it on the paper
6702000	6703000	Like you're still
6703000	6704000	There's a freestyle
6704000	6707000	You're selecting choices out of the freestyles
6707000	6709000	That are coming out of your head
6709000	6710000	Sure
6710000	6711000	Yeah
6711000	6712000	But then you make the choices
6712000	6713000	And you go
6713000	6714000	Okay, that's the one I'm using
6714000	6715000	Like this is the best option
6715000	6716000	Right
6716000	6717000	I write that one down
6717000	6718000	Yeah
6718000	6719000	That's an interesting idea
6719000	6720000	Like you don't
6720000	6721000	Yeah, you make a choice
6721000	6722000	And you go
6722000	6723000	I'm gonna make the best choice
6723000	6724000	A good one
6724000	6726000	Yeah, do the good thing
6726000	6727000	You know, like most writers
6727000	6728000	Right
6728000	6731000	Well, somebody wrote in England
6731000	6734000	Whose Lens Anyway was on the air in England
6734000	6736000	A hilarious review said
6736000	6739000	Why not prepare something funny?
6742000	6743000	And you're like
6743000	6744000	Why not improvise?
6745000	6746000	I'm gonna read
6746000	6748000	I'm gonna read something
6748000	6749000	A lot of people
6749000	6751000	You know, we have a history of this show
6751000	6752000	Of like
6752000	6753000	We, you know, people
6753000	6754000	We read
6754000	6755000	People who put themselves out there
6755000	6756000	And demand their time
6756000	6757000	They're on the skillet, you know
6758000	6761000	But I thought this was a
6761000	6764000	This isn't gonna blow anyone's mind
6764000	6765000	But I thought it was like
6765000	6767000	This is sort of the everyman kind of thing
6767000	6768000	I got this
6768000	6769000	I got handed this note
6769000	6771000	And I won't, I won't keep
6771000	6773000	I'll just get through it
6773000	6775000	But that's something to get through
6776000	6777000	In a way
6778000	6779000	Dear Dan, if you're reading this
6779000	6780000	It means that at some point
6780000	6782000	I was able to intercept you
6782000	6783000	And hand this to you
6783000	6784000	That's not true
6784000	6786000	I was given to it by a subordinate
6788000	6790000	It's brand done
6790000	6791000	If you
6791000	6792000	A subordinate
6793000	6794000	When are your friends
6794000	6795000	There are channels
6795000	6796000	And it got to me
6796000	6798000	That's the importance of, you know, boundaries
6798000	6799000	Who gave it to you?
6799000	6801000	I don't even remember
6801000	6802000	It was me
6802000	6803000	Someone I
6803000	6804000	Someone I
6804000	6805000	Someone I pay someone else
6805000	6806000	To remember their name
6807000	6808000	Steve
6809000	6810000	Keisha
6810000	6811000	Keisha, who was it?
6811000	6812000	They handed it to me
6812000	6813000	Steve, okay, sorry
6813000	6816000	Keisha, why did your voice overlap with mine?
6816000	6817000	Never mind, all right
6818000	6819000	Keisha
6819000	6820000	Keisha
6820000	6821000	You know what?
6821000	6822000	Yeah, you're welcome
6823000	6824000	You're welcome
6824000	6825000	No, I know
6825000	6826000	I don't accept
6828000	6831000	My diversity program can't be fictional
6831000	6832000	It doesn't help
6833000	6834000	If Demorge was here
6834000	6837000	The three of us would have whooped your ass
6839000	6840000	Such a stereotype
6840000	6841000	Shout out to Demorge
6841000	6842000	Demorge, Demorge
6843000	6844000	Demorge
6844000	6846000	Does he know the show is ending?
6846000	6847000	Yeah, he knows
6847000	6848000	Oh, okay, good
6848000	6849000	Keisha
6849000	6850000	Wow
6851000	6852000	The nerve
6853000	6854000	The nerve
6854000	6856000	In which case, thank you for taking it and reading it
6856000	6860000	Also, thank you for not socially rejecting me when I spoke to you briefly at the drawing room
6860000	6863000	Which would have haunted me forever in parentheses
6863000	6868000	And how you so generously and thoroughly answered my question about characterization
6868000	6870000	I've got pretty bad social anxiety
6870000	6873000	I feel lonely and ashamed a lot
6873000	6875000	But I'm learning to accept myself better
6875000	6877000	I've got a neurodiverse family
6877000	6879000	I'm learning to accept them better, too
6879000	6882000	I'm hearing about your complex relationships with people and writing
6882000	6883000	It has really helped me
6884000	6889000	Harmontown is so much more than 360 episodes of the best podcast ever made
6892000	6894000	I heard someone say no
6894000	6895000	No
6896000	6898000	It's not more than that
6898000	6899000	That's all it is
6899000	6901000	Listen to American Life
6903000	6906000	The day I came across your Story Structure 101 post
6906000	6908000	Was the day I also discovered Joseph Campbell in Harmontown
6908000	6911000	It was also the day I figured out how to end a story I was writing
6911000	6912000	Which was the first story I got published
6912000	6915000	Now I see this as that Campbellian thing
6915000	6918000	Where, if it's meant to be your adventure, the world will open
6918000	6921000	I will miss your dialogue on growth, truth, and happiness
6921000	6924000	I will miss the podcast like I am losing a very good friend
6924000	6926000	Thank you for everything
6926000	6931000	Although I am sure you'll continue to inspire your moonbound, neurodiverse band of Armenians
6931000	6933000	Just in different ways
6934000	6936000	Kristen, I'll just use her first name
6936000	6937000	Thank you, Kristen
6939000	6940000	That was really good
6940000	6943000	Also, I don't know if it's the same Kristen
6943000	6947000	But another Kristen gave me an awesome gift of a bunch of little notebooks like this
6947000	6949000	So thank you, Kristen, for that
6949000	6951000	It better not be like a letter that's identical to that
6951000	6952000	Except it's like
6955000	6956000	I don't want to get corny
6956000	6957000	But I really can't say like
6957000	6960000	The only thing that I will take away from this
6960000	6961000	What's it been, seven, eight years?
6961000	6962000	How long have we been doing this?
6962000	6963000	Yeah
6963000	6965000	By the way, I just want to say one thing
6966000	6969000	In 360 episodes I have gotten
6971000	6974000	Many, many letters pressed into my hand
6974000	6976000	And so if you're out there and you're thinking like
6976000	6978000	I wrote this motherfucker
6978000	6980000	My dog died
6980000	6982000	I've read
6982000	6986000	87 to 89 percent of the letters
6986000	6989000	That you've handed me in the back alley
6989000	6991000	Or the out front and stuff
6991000	6993000	And they're all always great
6993000	6996000	I read that one and got handed to me tonight
6996000	6999000	That one represents all of your letters
6999000	7001000	I think that's what's always been so special about it
7001000	7003000	Everybody that knows that we hang out in the drawing room
7003000	7005000	And you guys have come out and said hello
7005000	7007000	And usually in a very shy way
7007000	7009000	I have a question about that
7009000	7010000	Yeah?
7010000	7014000	Y'all tell people on the show that y'all hang out at the drawing room?
7014000	7016000	We mention it, yeah
7016000	7017000	Really?
7017000	7018000	In the very beginning
7018000	7019000	I've seen you there
7020000	7022000	I'm glad to know that now
7022000	7025000	Because I won't feel safe there anymore
7025000	7027000	Y'all let everybody know
7027000	7029000	That's where you hang out
7029000	7031000	It's been so cool throughout the years
7031000	7033000	Meeting you all
7033000	7035000	All these faces in the crowd
7035000	7036000	And people listening
7036000	7038000	It's been really cool just to like
7038000	7040000	I don't know why it means that much to you
7040000	7042000	But it means a lot to me
7042000	7044000	That you guys are all so sweet
7044000	7046000	Oh, that's the thing I was going to try
7046000	7048000	It means a lot to you because of
7049000	7050000	..
7059000	7062000	That is the most Harman sound thing I could have possibly ever
7063000	7065000	It means a lot to them because of the time spent
7065000	7066000	That's both the thing
7066000	7067000	That's like a way to deflect it
7067000	7069000	Because it's just time spent
7069000	7071000	I mean like you
7071000	7073000	And that's why when somebody says
7073000	7075000	Holy shit your podcast means so much
7075000	7078840	Like, that means they put in the time,
7078840	7081560	and it's like they've done as much work as we have.
7081560	7084120	But there are people that only listen to a dozen episodes,
7084120	7087320	there's people that have gone and listened to the entire thing
7087320	7089400	from the very beginning.
7089400	7093200	The fact that Grey Worm from Game of Thrones likes it,
7093200	7095280	the fact that Rob Cordry likes it,
7095280	7099680	the fact that people that I've met that live in Europe
7099680	7102800	and South America and shit, the fact
7102800	7107080	that it means something to listen to, I guess,
7107080	7111360	neurodiversity and our weird ramblings,
7111360	7112880	that it's really crazy to me.
7112880	7116080	Like, it's so, I will say to everybody that listens
7116080	7117880	to this one, like, thank you.
7117880	7118380	Yeah.
7118380	7118880	Yeah.
7118880	7119380	Yeah.
7119380	7119880	Yeah.
7119880	7122280	You're welcome.
7122280	7126680	Yeah, we got as much out of it as you did, believe me.
7126680	7128560	I didn't think we'd last seven weeks.
7133040	7133960	I can't believe it.
7139680	7140180	Ebert.
7140180	7142080	Waka, waka.
7142080	7144960	All right, Dan, we're getting close to closing time,
7144960	7146800	but I think it's time for you two.
7146800	7147320	We're in it.
7147320	7149000	Yeah, we're well past it, but.
7149000	7153120	But I'm going to put it on you right now.
7153120	7156160	Say goodbye to Hamilton.
7156160	7157080	Thank you, Jeff.
7157080	7158800	I started here.
7158800	7165440	Yeah, how can I?
7165440	7167000	The year was 2012.
7173240	7177760	Rob, how about, can we all give it up?
7177760	7181720	I think the most joyful part of Harman Town, in my experience,
7181720	7185360	has been Rob Schraub as a contribution.
7185360	7186880	Oh, man.
7186880	7189640	Thank you, Jeff.
7189640	7193960	I don't get it.
7193960	7196120	I don't get it.
7196120	7197600	No, no, no, no, no.
7197600	7198080	Yeah.
7198080	7199560	Can't you see it?
7199560	7200060	Hey.
7203720	7208960	If you're listening, there's people walking out.
7208960	7214640	People are stapling themselves to their chairs in what I can only
7214640	7216440	describe as a reverse ovation.
7222440	7224560	Rob Schraub.
7224560	7227440	I don't know what to say.
7227440	7230000	I really don't know what to say about any of that.
7230000	7232280	You're in the middle of a very complicated racial Oreo.
7232280	7234360	There's a lot of pressure on you.
7234360	7235520	It's a lot of pressure.
7235520	7236600	It's an inverted yeah.
7236600	7238160	Yeah, well, I don't know.
7238160	7241760	I mean, about maybe a year or two years ago,
7241760	7244640	I was going through a pretty dark time.
7244640	7247520	And that's when I started coming to the show regularly.
7247520	7252280	And it really, really helped me get back on my feet,
7252280	7253920	you know, like, just mentally.
7253920	7255280	I'll take it from here.
7255280	7256640	Yeah, please.
7256640	7259240	I'm about to drop it.
7259240	7262560	But it just made me feel less alone.
7262560	7270360	And I was just, yeah, I just hit a deep, deep valley creatively
7270360	7274520	and just, I don't know, and just being here.
7274520	7277920	And, you know, it was really, I mean, I just,
7277920	7280640	it was how I got to hang out with my friends.
7280640	7286360	And just getting a lot of love online was very, very, very
7286360	7288160	sweet.
7288160	7290520	It was very sweet.
7290520	7295400	And I'm not, I don't really, it's not
7295400	7298720	hitting me how much I'm going to miss it yet.
7298720	7301480	You know, like right now, all I'm thinking of, like,
7301480	7304640	my knees are so fucking cold right now.
7304640	7307800	Because it's just, like, freezing, it's freezing.
7307800	7309280	It's freezing up here.
7309280	7311360	Why just your knees?
7311360	7312080	I don't know.
7312080	7314200	Like, this area, like, is right here.
7314200	7315480	Are your knees cold?
7315480	7316400	You got some cold knees?
7316400	7320400	No, no one has your weird Midwestern old man's disease.
7320400	7321240	Wow, winter's coming.
7321240	7322040	I take it back.
7322040	7322800	I don't miss it.
7322800	7325400	My knee caps, I'm not going to miss this.
7325400	7326920	I'm not going to miss this.
7327800	7329920	I do want to say the reason I brought up the Duncan Trussell
7329920	7337120	thing and podcasting in general is because what is happening?
7337120	7340040	It's just the haunted house music is just playing.
7340040	7342080	This is Jeff's outgoing voicemail.
7342080	7345000	It's a get used to it song.
7345000	7349280	No, no, oh, you were talking to him.
7349280	7351120	This is just as good as your thing, Dan.
7357920	7364160	I say, thank you so much, man, for being like me.
7364160	7368240	And, like, yeah, we'll feel this 20 years from now.
7368240	7370240	And that's because we're better people.
7370240	7371680	I'm already feeling it.
7371680	7372600	Well, yeah, me too.
7372600	7375360	I don't know what we're talking about.
7375360	7378000	But the reason I brought up the Duncan Trussell thing
7378000	7381480	was also because, like, I want you guys to understand,
7381480	7383200	everyone within the reach of my voice,
7384000	7387200	like, I have been addicted to podcasts
7387200	7389120	and have relationships with podcasts.
7389120	7392240	So I understand.
7392240	7398600	And that's why I'm so grateful to you guys for choosing it,
7398600	7400760	because there has to be a lot of forgiveness involved.
7400760	7403040	And there's an addiction that is really,
7403040	7406600	it reflects the best part of you, where you're like,
7406600	7410000	you know, warts and all, I'm going to just keep coming back
7410000	7412680	to this, and I choose this to be my family.
7412680	7417080	And I, like, in saying goodbye, I
7417080	7419280	want you guys to really hear me on this,
7419280	7423440	that, like, I'm old and tired and really looking forward
7423440	7429680	to woodwork and, like, just kind of like not being myself
7429680	7431120	as a famous person for a while.
7431120	7433960	That has absolutely nothing to do with the advice
7433960	7436480	I would give you if you're 25 and you're,
7436480	7440920	or 75 but spiritually 25, because you're just now
7440920	7443640	going, like, what the fuck should I do tomorrow?
7443640	7445800	Like, please put yourself out there.
7445800	7449920	Don't give up on the transparency and vulnerability
7449920	7453800	and honesty as the eventual cure-all
7453800	7456360	and the war between good and evil.
7456360	7459080	Like, I am not waving a white flag.
7459080	7461360	I am, like, laying down and taking a long nap
7461360	7462600	after a Thanksgiving dinner.
7462600	7465800	Like, I am fat and sad and tired.
7465800	7468360	Or not sad, sad, sad, like, the way you're sad,
7468360	7470360	because Wizard of Oz is on again.
7471280	7473080	Like, not sad.
7473080	7474680	Not bad, sad.
7474680	7476720	Like, fo-fo, it's done.
7476720	7479680	Like, that's sad.
7479680	7483720	Like, please, like, if the things
7483720	7486760	that you guys say about, like, what inspired you about it,
7486760	7487640	stick with that.
7487640	7488800	Go with that.
7488800	7490520	I am not, I'm not, I'm not ending it
7490520	7493640	because those things don't work and don't make me very happy.
7493640	7495800	And I got to say to a lot of you kids
7495800	7498640	who have said to me, you know, shared
7498640	7502000	the incredibly personal and touchy topic
7502000	7505480	of being close to the edge at certain times,
7505480	7507160	which is not an abnormal thing,
7507160	7508560	and not something to be ashamed of,
7508560	7512040	and something you absolutely should share with somebody.
7512040	7513920	I have been there, too,
7513920	7517560	and this podcast has kept me away from that ledge.
7517560	7523360	And so definitely fucking, like, follow your bliss.
7523360	7527840	If you are so sad that this podcast is ending,
7527840	7532360	this may be your cue now to whether it's a podcast
7532360	7535720	or a basil garden on your windowsill or a rocking chair.
7535720	7539960	Like, you, like, do that project, do that thing.
7539960	7542640	New action creates new thought.
7542640	7544920	Don't fucking check out on me.
7544920	7547560	The world has sucked since way before you were born.
7547560	7550520	Like, that's not, that's not a logical decision.
7551520	7553320	Like, this too shall pass.
7553320	7554480	Stick with me.
7554480	7555920	Be exceptional.
7555920	7558120	Tell me this story 20 years from now
7558120	7559520	when you run into me at a bar.
7559520	7561920	I thank you so much for being here for me.
7561920	7563600	You saved my life.
7564520	7565880	Also, Spencer Crittenden,
7565880	7568680	what would the world be without meeting us, Spencer?
7568680	7570320	Can we please give a huge?
7570320	7571160	Oh, yeah.
7571160	7572000	Yeah.
7572000	7572840	Yeah.
7572840	7574680	There would be no Harmon Quest.
7574680	7575520	Oh, yeah.
7575520	7576360	Yeah.
7576360	7577200	Yeah.
7578200	7580040	Yeah.
7580040	7581000	Oh, no.
7581000	7582080	Spencer loves this.
7582080	7582920	He loves it.
7583840	7587040	Check out Color of Chaos on DMs Guild.
7589920	7591400	It's an advertisement.
7592360	7596040	And, uh, Brandon Johnson and Steve Levy
7596040	7600120	and Demarge Brown and Curtis Armstrong
7600120	7602840	and all the people that we've had together.
7602840	7606880	And also, look around, give everybody next to you a hug
7606880	7609280	because you guys are all the greatest.
7609280	7611280	I'm gonna cry because I'm a crier.
7612080	7614440	I love you all so much.
7614440	7615560	Mike Eagle, everybody.
7615560	7616560	Give it up for Mike.
7617680	7619360	Thank you for being here.
7619360	7622240	Give it up for Camille Nanjiani, Emily Gordon.
7624440	7626480	Oh, y'all, thank you so much.
7627400	7629640	Let's all go next door and have a drink together.
7629640	7631320	I'm gonna get sad and cry.
7636240	7638000	I've been your Count of Total Jeff Davis.
7638000	7639440	Your mayor, Dan Harmon.
7641280	7642120	Yeah.
7645080	7645920	Drive fast.
7647200	7649120	Take chances.
7649120	7650360	Let's all get down.
7651880	7654920	Oh, here comes the dance party.
7654920	7658200	Chop, Harmon, get a dance.
7658200	7659640	Well, from the beginning,
7659640	7661800	we've never known how to do an ending.
7661800	7663960	We've always had the show go on too long
7663960	7666000	and this is the name of that rap song.
7666000	7668280	It's too long, the show's too long.
7668280	7670520	This is the name of that rap song.
7670600	7672240	I have a small ding dong
7672240	7675000	and that's apparently why global warming is happening.
7676760	7678640	Good night, see you next door.
7683480	7684320	Thank y'all.
7685920	7688760	The next Harmon, not Harmon-chan,
7688760	7690320	but the next podcast is yet to come.
7690320	7691520	I'll keep you posted.
7691520	7692560	So, look alive.
7692560	7693400	Whoo!
7711400	7712520	Did you get any of that?
7713680	7715560	It's a good show.
