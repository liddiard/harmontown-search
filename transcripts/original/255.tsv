12140	13140	Yeah!
13140	23140	Some bemagius maximus, Harbin Town is now in session.
23140	36140	Let's bring out our game master Spencer Crittenden everybody.
36140	48140	And the mayor of Harbin Town, Chad Harbin.
48140	53140	Thank you, thank you.
53140	56140	We should get some official business out of the way first.
56140	60140	There's a birthday boy here.
60140	65140	There's probably multiple birthday boys, but only one had friends that emailed Steve Levy
65140	68140	and said birthday boys come into town from Ohio.
68140	70140	His name is Ian Bowers.
70140	73140	Ian Bowers, are you in the house?
73140	76140	Raise your hand Ian, where are you?
76140	78140	Way back there.
78140	84140	Ian Bowers in his business casual Saturday look with no sleeves, I like him.
84140	86140	So I wrote a little song for you Ian.
86140	88140	Ian Bowers, are we saying that right?
88140	90140	You're from Ohio, correct?
90140	93140	And your gal flew in just for this?
93140	97140	Well, you could have lied to us and said...
97140	102140	Well yeah, they said just for this, so I wrote a song.
102140	106140	What are you going to medieval times to?
106140	114140	Because a lot of people come to the show just to knock out other shit and I wrote you a song.
114140	116140	Dan, you don't have to sing it.
116140	120140	If your feelings are hurt, maybe you don't sing it.
120140	126140	This is the phone sound, the lightning we need working.
126140	129140	Ian, what else did you come to L.A. for?
129140	130140	I wrote a Dr. Drew.
130140	134140	Alright, meaning drugs.
134140	137140	Awesome, are you going to climb rocks and do acid and stuff?
137140	140140	More or less.
140140	143140	Is the lightning cable audio?
143140	148140	Oh yeah.
148140	152140	Ian Bowers grew his food from the land.
152140	156140	Ian Bowers took a poop in his hand.
156140	160140	Ian Bowers told the truth like a man.
160140	164140	He said, mama, I just took a poop in my hand.
164140	169140	And she said, oh Ian, don't you know, this is how you grow.
169140	174140	You need to leave Ohio while the harvest moon is low.
174140	180140	And drive across the land so Dan can use GarageBand to make you understand.
180140	183140	You've got to not poop in your hand.
183140	187140	You've got to use a toilet, Ian, because it's your birthday.
187140	189140	Ian, it's your birthday.
189140	192140	Ian Bowers, it's your birthday.
192140	194140	It's your birthday.
194140	196140	It's your birthday.
196140	200140	The second verse is improvised.
200140	204140	Ian Bowers took some pee in a jar.
204140	206140	Drank it down.
206140	209140	Got in his car with his girlfriends.
209140	212140	Drove and they drove across the land.
212140	219140	Took their bags by their hand and a pee inside a jar.
219140	228140	And they rubbed it together and made a poopy pee together.
228140	231140	Birds of a midwestern feather.
231140	236140	Ian and his girlfriend not to objectify her.
236140	241140	Let's let her pass the sexy lamp test.
241140	242140	I think they call it.
242140	244140	Have you heard of that test, Jeff?
244140	249140	Seems a little codependent if your boyfriend wants to make you drive across the country
249140	251140	and drink his pee and poop.
251140	252140	No.
252140	254140	It's called true love.
254140	256140	It's called interdependent.
256140	260140	People, individuals that love each other so much, they consider you...
260140	264140	Will you know when you love somebody truly?
264140	268140	If they'll eat your poo and drink your pee.
268140	272140	Darling, won't you come to the Apache Trail,
272140	277140	put on your boots and fuck a snail?
277140	281140	And they never had to even stop for gas
281140	284140	because their car was fueled by the love
284140	288140	that comes from drinking each other's pooping pee.
288140	294140	Ian Bowers, now flowers grow for you.
294140	298140	For your pee and poo, for your pee and poo.
298140	307140	In the ring of fire, what for me and you?
307140	320140	Now, Ian, if you think the people of the fucking medieval times are going to do that for you,
320140	322140	you're a fucking mistake.
322140	324140	Yeah, they're going to get a list of everyone's birthdays
324140	327140	and then they're going to throw a plastic treasure at you
327140	331140	because everyone that goes there, it's their birthday.
331140	333140	It's a con.
334140	338140	Only this show does what we just did.
338140	343140	Only this show makes you theoretically pee and poo.
343140	347140	Jeff, are you familiar with the pill cultures online,
347140	350140	like the red pill, the blue pill?
350140	352140	Now there's more pill.
352140	354140	Well, it's based on The Matrix.
354140	355140	No, I have not.
355140	356140	Hit me to the judge.
356140	357140	Based on The Matrix.
357140	359140	I love that blue pill community, man.
359140	362140	Yeah, but man, those blue pill people are the worst.
362140	363140	No, we just love it.
363140	365140	They're just in the dreamland.
365140	366140	Oh, man.
366140	367140	That's us.
367140	368140	We're the blue pill people.
368140	369140	Oh, boy.
369140	376140	Because we live in the fucking illusion where women are equals and your vote matters.
376140	377140	Yeah, it's great.
377140	378140	That's what I'm saying.
378140	379140	Stink tastes good.
379140	382140	And Joel Pantoliano is a senator or something.
382140	383140	I don't know.
383140	384140	That's the blue.
384140	385140	That's the illusion.
385140	387140	And then the red pill is like the nuance.
387140	388140	It's the edge.
388140	389140	It's the fucking...
389140	390140	I see all the levels.
390140	391140	I see it.
391140	395140	I see the hard truths that no one wants to see.
395140	396140	That's the red pill.
396140	397980	That's you living in reality.
397980	402980	But then we were getting confused today because there's also black pill.
402980	404980	Black pill, I think, is when you're...
404980	408540	I think it's when either pill just made you insane.
408540	413140	I think if you red pill so much that you disconnect from reality, you've now black pilled.
413140	414140	Oh, boy.
414140	417140	Also, those pills are more likely to be shot by police.
418140	423140	But if you take the red pills, you know why.
423140	424140	Right.
424140	427140	If you take blue pills, you're like, why are the black pills getting shot?
427140	429140	I don't understand.
431140	432140	Are they snagglepuss?
432140	433140	Yeah.
433140	437140	And then there was something about white pills, and I don't know what that is.
437140	439140	But there's different pills for different things.
439140	443140	And then there's different movements, too, online.
444140	446140	So this is the weird thing.
446140	455140	Because in my day, 2016, it was like you were either an alpha or a cuck.
455140	457140	That's what I understood to be the case.
457140	462140	And so a cuck is, okay, you can't handle women.
462140	468140	You're submissive to them because you just hope that women will just donate some sex to you.
468140	470140	You're living the lie.
470140	476140	You're like, please, ladies, if I virtue signal enough, won't you give me your vagina nuggets?
476140	479140	Alms for the cuck, poor.
479140	482140	Please, Cersei, please.
482140	487140	Throw your vagina candies from your Lannister wagon.
490140	491140	And those are cucks.
491140	492140	That's me.
494140	497140	And then all of our friends and almost everybody in the audience,
497140	503140	except for maybe one guy who's going to run up here and go, eeeh, or something at some point in the show,
503140	505140	and I'll become Shia LaBeouf.
508140	511140	And then I thought, and then the other thing is you're alpha, okay?
511140	512140	You work out.
512140	514140	Your body's a temple.
514140	520140	You try not to jerk off a lot, I think, because you deserve sex from women who are sluts.
520140	525140	And if they try to pretend like they're not, it's like some shit they're trying to pull.
525140	531140	And you need to understand that if you say to a woman, like, nice coat, she'll be like, oh, can I suck your dick?
531140	535140	Because, like, they just respond to that shit since paleo times.
535140	539140	So that's the other side.
539140	541140	And I'm trying to be objective about this.
541140	543140	Like, I'm going to be like, oh, those are the two things I understood.
543140	549140	But lately what I've been learning about is now there's like, there's, I have no, and I don't want to like stomp on any,
549140	553140	I don't want anybody to be like, that's not what that is, and you got that backwards.
553140	556140	I'm assuming I don't know what the fuck anyone's talking about anymore.
556140	562140	But I'm just like, Cody was like sitting in bed today with the iPad, and she's like, what the fuck?
562140	564140	And I was like, what?
564140	568140	There's these things, there's like omega, omega virgins or something.
568140	571140	There's this whole thing about virginity now.
571140	582140	So there's like alt-righty kind of people who are virgins but who don't want to have sex with women and are straight.
582140	583140	Because that would make them a cuck?
583140	584140	Right.
584140	585140	What?
585140	586140	I think that's what it is.
586140	592140	It's like, I'm a virgin and I have power because I'm a virgin because no sale, young lady.
592140	597140	Because the very idea of pleasuring a woman is vile to me.
597140	601140	Or even getting pleasure from them though.
601140	605140	So you're talking about we're subdividing now because there's people who are going like, look,
605140	612140	you're not going to fucking defeat me by pointing out that I have a hunchback or a mole on my lip or something.
612140	615140	That's why I'm a Nazi.
615140	616140	I know that card.
616140	618140	I'm not going to let you play it.
618140	620140	Because there's a thing called incel?
620140	621140	Is that?
621140	623140	It's involuntary celibacy?
623140	626140	Now, is that the same thing?
626140	630140	That just means I'm a militant virgin.
630140	633140	But involuntary doesn't sound like militant about being a virgin.
633140	639140	It sounds like voluntary, but it's like, I can't get laid, but I wouldn't if I could.
639140	642140	No, involuntary means you didn't choose.
642140	643140	Right.
643140	647140	It's like being a proud Quasimodo.
647140	650140	I chose to be unfuckable.
650140	655140	No, I didn't choose, but I chose to be proud of not being involuntarily fuckable.
655140	656140	Oh, OK.
656140	657140	Yeah.
657140	659140	Well, but if you think about it for a second, it's not that...
659140	660140	They're taking it back.
660140	661140	What's that?
661140	662140	They're taking it back.
662140	663140	They don't want to be called virgins.
663140	665140	They're incels.
665140	668140	Sounds like their splinter cell or something.
668140	673140	Well, they're breaking the chains of that go-to that you can always say.
673140	674140	Sure.
674140	677140	You could just say, well, you're ugly and you're just doing this because you're pent up
677140	681140	and you have a lot of sperm in your balls that can't get out and you don't like jerking off
681140	688140	for some reason because you read that Joe Rogan doesn't or something and you're...
688140	690140	I'm not banging on the roaster.
691140	693140	Now I don't want to jerk off anymore.
693140	694140	Joe Rogan doesn't?
694140	695140	I don't know.
695140	696140	I don't know.
696140	701140	He's all ripped in cage fights and I don't know.
701140	703140	I imagine that he probably...
703140	707140	I wouldn't be surprised if he found out he was like, no, dude, you got a nofap or something.
707140	708140	I don't know.
708140	710140	Or maybe he's like, no, you're going to jerk off three times a day.
710140	711140	I don't know.
711140	715140	But I shouldn't have ripped Joe Rogan's name and it's going to be very distracting.
715140	718140	I'm just saying, I think it's kind of interesting, the idea of...
718140	723140	Because what we're really talking about here is our original base, nerds.
723140	726140	You're talking about people that feel unfuckable, people that are like...
726140	731140	And when they look in the mirror, they're like, oh, yeah, I know why no one wants to fuck me.
731140	739140	And then those people are saying, yeah, but I still want to be on the alpha side.
739140	744140	So you can't tell me, oh, no one wants to fuck you.
744140	746140	I know that.
746140	749140	You're not supposed to want to and I don't care.
749140	754140	Yes, if I had a magic wand, I would make myself look like Tom Cruise.
754140	756140	No, I cannot do that.
756140	758140	I do not have that magic wand.
758140	759140	I am proud of myself.
759140	761140	You will not shame me.
761140	764140	I still know bitches is crazy.
764140	767140	I'm the king of unfuckability.
767140	768140	It's interesting.
768140	771140	See all these little quadrants that are sub-quadrants are developing.
771140	773140	There's this guy.
773140	776140	Cody was like, she just went down this rabbit hole.
776140	778140	If it was me, I wouldn't.
778140	781140	But I was like, you got to text that to me.
781140	783140	So this is like an example.
783140	789140	This is a blog entry from a guy that's like a...
789140	792140	I don't know if he would call himself Incel or if he could...
792140	794140	His blog entry...
794140	799140	I don't want to be the reason why shade gets thrown on him as the millennials say.
799140	803140	I don't want to be the...
803140	807140	The words Omega Virgin are in his URL.
807140	814140	So I assume he's like an Incel or a Super Verge.
814140	816140	I don't know if these guys hate each other.
816140	817140	Just look over there.
817140	819140	The Super Verge has just crashed the party.
819140	823140	Let's show them how Incels do it.
823140	827140	Sanctuary.
827140	828140	So this is his blog entry.
828140	833140	The title is women think that gazpacho is creepy.
833140	837140	Well, that's where he and I agree because I...
837140	839140	I'm kidding.
839140	844140	Yesterday I was out getting lunch that recently added gazpacho,
844140	847140	a cold Spanish tomato soup, to their menu.
847140	853140	I overheard two women ahead of me in line talking about the new gazpacho.
853140	857140	One of the women asks the other what gazpacho is.
857140	860140	Change tense, that's fine.
860140	862140	The other woman says...
862140	865140	Damn, damn, don't, don't tempt shame.
865140	868140	I mean, where is the pride maypole if it's not?
868140	870140	I mean, there's got to be something.
870140	872140	You've got to be Frasier if you're going to go here.
872140	874140	Okay.
874140	877140	One of the women asks the other what gazpacho is.
877140	880140	The other woman says that it's like salsa that you drink.
880140	884140	The first woman says that gazpacho is creepy.
884140	887140	The second woman agreed.
887140	892140	After that, I made sure to get some gazpacho with my lunch.
892140	895140	Because I was not going to let women ruin gazpacho,
895140	899140	especially by calling gazpacho creepy.
899140	905140	I have been saying for a long time that women calling men creepy is bullshit.
905140	909140	However, this proves it.
909140	914140	Women are willing to call traditional Spanish cuisine creepy,
914140	917140	which is complete rubbish by itself.
917140	919140	If a soup can be creepy,
919140	924140	then any man being called creepy is meaningless.
924140	927140	He let himself off the hook.
927140	931140	I don't know what formula that is in geometric equations.
931140	933140	I don't know if that's the transitive property.
933140	936140	It's called the prestige.
936140	939140	If two women think soup is creepy,
939140	941140	and all women think I'm creepy,
941140	944140	and I eat the soup and like it,
944140	947140	I'm Tom Cruise.
947140	951140	It brings up this point because I can almost sense some of you thinking
951140	953140	what I'm thinking as I'm halfway through that.
953140	955140	I'm like, wait, is this a bit?
955140	957140	Is this guy doing a character?
957140	959140	This is the problem with our new generation.
959140	961140	They're very ironic and savvy.
961140	963140	You can't tell.
964140	966140	Also, I think that's like a fallback.
966140	970140	It's kind of like when you go to a high school dance
970140	975140	or wherever, it's a function and you're feeling awkward
975140	978140	and you don't know when you should dance and if you should dance
978140	980140	and if you do dance, how you should dance
980140	983140	and what you think of the people dancing.
983140	986140	There's always things going through your head,
986140	990140	but you can conquer a lot of them by just kind of going like this
990140	992140	and dancing goofy.
993140	995140	There's so much fluidity there.
995140	1001140	I just think that these kids today,
1006140	1010140	it's so easy to just be passionate about something
1010140	1012140	and rail about something,
1012140	1014140	and then if anybody were to ever say,
1014140	1016140	well, that's fucked up.
1016140	1018140	You seem like a horrible person.
1018140	1020140	You could be like, that's the point.
1020140	1022140	Even if it wasn't the point,
1022140	1024140	you could just be like, that's the point.
1024140	1027140	Or you could say, I was kidding, even if you weren't kidding.
1027140	1030140	You could even not know if you're kidding or what the point is.
1030140	1033140	That's why these fucking children of the damned are terrifying to me.
1033140	1036140	They don't know even what Nazism is,
1036140	1039140	and they're like, oh, this swastika will look great on my balls,
1039140	1042140	and then they take their balls out there,
1042140	1044140	they put them out there, and their balls get kicked,
1044140	1046140	and they're like, this is fucking fucked up, man.
1046140	1048140	We don't know when they're kidding.
1048140	1052140	Did you see that guy, the guy, the guy that talked like Bob Hope,
1052140	1056140	the white supremacist in the Vice Land documentary, that guy?
1056140	1059140	It's like, the Jews are killing me. Oh, boy.
1062140	1067140	I got to say, how do you even say we're nonviolent?
1067140	1068140	I mean, we're violent.
1068140	1070140	I don't know. I'll kill these fucking people if I have to.
1070140	1072140	And then he's in the hotel room, and he's going like,
1072140	1075140	I don't even know what a Chelsea man is.
1075140	1077140	Didn't you think while you were watching that video,
1077140	1080140	like, is this dude kidding? He might be doing a bit.
1080140	1082140	And I'm like, where does this bit land?
1082140	1084140	Like, what if it's part of some plan, you know?
1084140	1086140	That's why I didn't bother making fun of him,
1086140	1088140	because I was like, this is too easy.
1088140	1091140	But what I did love most of all was that then, of course,
1091140	1096140	the OK Cupid pulling his profile and then going like,
1096140	1099140	he's banned for life.
1099140	1101140	This is why I choose the blue pill,
1101140	1105140	because I like the idea that hive mind or not,
1105140	1108140	that that can be this guy's purgatory,
1108140	1111140	that that's, like, undateable.
1111140	1114140	Like, he's just branded, and he's like,
1114140	1115140	ah, come on, that sucks.
1115140	1120140	Like, I just wanted to use OK Cupid to meet a Nazi girl.
1120140	1124140	Talk about Jews and how they shouldn't be.
1124140	1128140	Well, I tickled her belly with a rose.
1128140	1131140	I like long walks on the beach,
1131140	1136140	and I can't wait to get these black people out of here.
1136140	1140140	I got 17 guns and four manifestos,
1140140	1146140	and I love stranger things.
1146140	1150140	Will you be mine?
1150140	1154140	Pending a ancestry.com check.
1154140	1157140	He's also that new wave of Nazi,
1157140	1160140	where he's not afraid to show his emotional side.
1160140	1162140	He's afraid to cry on camera.
1162140	1164140	I know, but why would he do that?
1164140	1165140	Why would he do that?
1165140	1167140	And the answer is, well, he's nuts, right?
1167140	1168140	He's unhinged.
1168140	1169140	He's borderline.
1169140	1172140	That's how he got into racism in the first place.
1172140	1175140	There's some valve missing where he doesn't have perspective.
1175140	1178140	He doesn't see the bigger picture.
1178140	1179140	And maybe sometimes we don't.
1179140	1181140	There were 20,000 people in Boston.
1181140	1182140	It was this big show.
1182140	1183140	We all loved it.
1183140	1184140	And then we were like, I was just slowly like,
1184140	1187140	wait, who's in that rotunda?
1187140	1188140	You woke up to it.
1188140	1193140	I was like, hate speech rally, absolutely shut down
1193140	1194140	by the people of Boston.
1194140	1195140	They filled the streets.
1195140	1196140	This beautiful image.
1196140	1198140	They saw all the racists in the world
1198140	1200140	only fit inside this little rotunda.
1200140	1203140	And then everybody else is going around.
1203140	1207140	There were people chanting fuck free speech.
1207140	1209140	It's alarming.
1209140	1212140	But you still take it.
1212140	1214140	It's way better than the alternative.
1214140	1216140	Five months ago, if you had asked me,
1216140	1218140	oh, what do you think is going to happen?
1218140	1221140	I'd be like, all those 20,000 people are going to be like,
1221140	1222140	give them a chance.
1222140	1223140	Give Trump a chance.
1223140	1225140	And I'd be packing my bags.
1225140	1229140	And I'd just go to, I don't know where I'd go, Tulum.
1229140	1235140	Go back to maybe I can afford to live under the hotel.
1235140	1238140	But I really, no, I had the lowest opinion of us.
1238140	1240140	I thought that all the people, I thought that if you gathered
1240140	1245140	20,000 of us, we would be like, oh, I'm scared enough to, sure,
1245140	1248140	I'll hate an immigrant or two, or we'll wrap that in a package.
1248140	1250140	I don't have to say that out loud anymore.
1250140	1253140	We'll call it a different thing, and I'll start chanting that.
1253140	1257140	So even if there was just one old lady in that rotunda
1257140	1261140	with a free speech sign, and she just pissed her pants and died,
1261140	1267140	it's still a better day than maybe she really died, I guess.
1267140	1270140	OK, fine.
1270140	1273140	Would she die of pissing her pants?
1273140	1276140	I mean, let's say she died of natural causes and people felt bad.
1276140	1280140	Like, she was like, oh, she had a thyroid condition.
1280140	1282140	I hope you get that.
1282140	1285140	Anyways, but it's better times now, right?
1285140	1291140	It's like a weird, it's like part of the carnival ride
1291140	1297140	where you're already through the shit that really made you piss your pants.
1297140	1301140	But it's like no more safe now, but you're desensitized.
1301140	1304140	But now you're kind of like, I don't know,
1304140	1307140	like really we're now shouting faster at the carny.
1307140	1309140	Like, we're like, faster!
1309140	1312140	Whereas we were, you know, now we're all out of our minds
1312140	1314140	and just wanting to do this.
1314140	1319140	Like, let's take this, let's see where this goes.
1319140	1322140	Yeah, it's like the most alarming thing for me is that
1322140	1325140	they don't have to wear hoods anymore.
1325140	1327140	They get to actually show their face on camera.
1327140	1329140	That's the scary thing.
1329140	1331140	I mean, it's alarming that they thought they could,
1331140	1334140	but it's uplifting that it turns out they kind of couldn't.
1334140	1337140	Like, they're getting fired and they're bummed out.
1337140	1342140	I just thought I could hit a couple black people on the weekends.
1342140	1344140	Yeah, and it's that logic thing.
1344140	1347140	You revert to that logic thing and the outrage thing and the victim thing.
1347140	1350140	It's like more and more what we're learning is that the entire time,
1350140	1352140	it's just like we're all like little kittens
1352140	1356140	and we want to suck at this titty of like feeling sorry for ourselves.
1356140	1360140	Like, these are the people that perceived everybody else
1360140	1364140	as getting a big mouthful of that specific titty.
1364140	1368140	Like, they perceive the rest of us as feeling sorry for ourselves
1368140	1371140	and getting like handouts for being victims.
1371140	1373140	And they were like, I want that job.
1373140	1375140	I always thought the whole time they were like,
1375140	1378140	get off my shoe, you crazy victim.
1378140	1380140	They were like, no, move over victim.
1380140	1382140	I want that victim gravy.
1382140	1384140	You're hogging it all.
1384140	1385140	Delicious victim gravy.
1385140	1386140	I want to be oppressed.
1386140	1391140	Like, there was a guy, one of those virgin soldier people
1391140	1396140	was like they referred to women as oppression thieves.
1396140	1398140	Wait, what?
1398140	1399140	And I thought that was an eye opener.
1399140	1401140	I was like, yeah, they were oppression thieves.
1401140	1403140	They were referring specifically to the Harambe meme
1403140	1406140	and how women hijacked that and turned it into...
1406140	1408140	I remember when that happened.
1408140	1410140	That's not fair because we were just having fun
1410140	1412140	and women turned everything into how women are victims.
1412140	1413140	Yeah, that sucked.
1413140	1415140	And then I thought I understood all that logic,
1415140	1417140	but now it's kind of adorable that it turns out
1417140	1419140	the rest of that sentence is like, yeah, women,
1419140	1420140	we're the victims.
1420140	1421140	We want to be the victims.
1421140	1423140	We never get to be the victims.
1423140	1426140	It's like, that's what privilege really is.
1426140	1427140	It's a form of oppression.
1427140	1429140	It's like denial of victimhood.
1429140	1431140	You know, that's not fair.
1431140	1433140	I never got to be a victim.
1433140	1436140	You don't know what it's like to wake up every day
1436140	1441140	and have no idea what a victim feels like.
1442140	1445140	There's not a minute that goes by where I don't know
1445140	1448140	that I command all that I survey.
1448140	1451140	And I still can't get a job.
1451140	1452140	Right, exactly.
1452140	1454140	Isn't that a real fucking problem?
1454140	1459140	Hey, Mr. Superior Race, you could drop a few.
1459140	1462140	You could be a little sexier.
1462140	1463140	What, are you fucking kidding me?
1463140	1466140	I've been turning my body into a goddamn fucking
1466140	1469140	shoe killing machine.
1469140	1470140	But why?
1470140	1473140	I got a fucking bar in my kitchen doorway
1473140	1476140	and a fucking crank on animals.
1476140	1480140	Mr. Superior, I don't understand if you're so superior
1480140	1482140	to everybody, how come you feel so under the thumb
1482140	1484140	of these inferior people?
1484140	1489140	Because of the Jews and the black people
1489140	1492140	and the black Jews.
1492140	1495140	It sounds like you're afraid that they might have
1495140	1498140	one up on you, they might be superior.
1498140	1499140	I think maybe you're afraid.
1499140	1500140	I think you're afraid.
1500140	1502140	I think you're afraid of the reality.
1502140	1505140	The guy that doesn't have six guns and a knife on him.
1505140	1507140	I seem more relaxed than you do.
1507140	1509140	I just brought these so I could feel comfortable
1509140	1511140	speaking my mind.
1511140	1514140	That's not something you could understand.
1514140	1517140	You bring black people when you want to speak your mind.
1517140	1518140	I have weapons.
1518140	1522140	I don't trust black people to protect my speech.
1522140	1526140	You've got all these black people helping you speak.
1526140	1530140	Are you secretly Jay Leno?
1530140	1533140	No, no, not at all.
1533140	1535140	But I just want to show you some headlines
1535140	1538140	about the problem that we're facing here.
1538140	1539140	This is real.
1539140	1540140	This was really in the paper here.
1540140	1541140	Look at this headline.
1541140	1544140	I saw that you drove here in a Stanley Steamer.
1544140	1548140	Look, that's a white power car.
1548140	1549140	It's vintage.
1549140	1550140	It's a Butte.
1550140	1551140	Look at this headline.
1551140	1553140	It says, if you get a load of this,
1553140	1559140	man saves Jew from tree, gives it a bowl of milk.
1559140	1561140	This is real.
1561140	1563140	Anyways, we get these headlines.
1563140	1564140	I don't know.
1564140	1567140	Here's the next one.
1567140	1568140	This is a coupon in the paper.
1568140	1569140	Look at this.
1569140	1571140	Three cakes and then look down on the corner.
1571140	1576140	Jews.
1576140	1577140	All right, okay, I'm Jay Leno.
1577140	1578140	I'm Jay Leno.
1578140	1579140	You caught me.
1579140	1580140	You caught me.
1580140	1583140	It's okay to admit that you're Jay Leno.
1583140	1585140	I just feel like I don't have a place.
1585140	1586140	I feel like I'm being replaced.
1586140	1589140	You were the king of late night for a while.
1589140	1592140	No, right, last forever.
1592140	1596140	You can't be the king of late night for a thousand years.
1596140	1597140	That's your perception.
1597140	1600140	That's how you see it.
1600140	1602140	Anyways, we have a great show.
1602140	1604140	Let's bring out Keira Knightley, everybody.
1604140	1606140	Keira Knightley is here tonight.
1606140	1607140	Actually, we do have a guest.
1607140	1609140	He's been on the show before.
1609140	1610140	He's our old friend.
1610140	1612140	Let's welcome him back.
1612140	1616140	The creator of the original IT crowd and so much more.
1616140	1625140	And big, old Irish cousin of Harmontown from the Irish Harmontown annex.
1625140	1626140	Experience.
1626140	1628140	I was giving him time to get in the door.
1628140	1631140	Let's have a hand for Graham Linehan.
1631140	1633140	Yeah.
1633140	1635140	Whoo!
1647140	1648140	Hello, Graham.
1648140	1649140	Hi.
1649140	1650140	How are you?
1650140	1651140	Good. How are you?
1651140	1652140	We're bringing you to town.
1652140	1653140	Do you live here now, or are you a traveler?
1653140	1655140	I just come here to do Harmontown.
1655140	1656140	That's it?
1656140	1657140	Yeah.
1657140	1661140	The last time I was here, the first day, I did the same thing.
1661140	1662140	I tweeted, I'm in LA.
1662140	1663140	What should I do?
1663140	1667140	And I went to Glendale, which I didn't really like.
1667140	1669140	So no offense to people.
1669140	1671140	Nobody really likes Glendale, right?
1671140	1674140	It's like the prisoner, isn't it, a little bit?
1674140	1675140	Doesn't it?
1675140	1681140	And then today, I forgot I went to Glendale before.
1681140	1683140	And I did exactly the same thing.
1683140	1684140	I said, where should I go?
1684140	1687140	And I fucking ended up in Glendale again.
1687140	1691140	And then I did Harmontown that night.
1691140	1693140	And I've just done that again now.
1693140	1697140	So it's like Barton Fink, except instead of doing wrestler movies,
1697140	1699140	I'm just going to be on Harmontown for the rest of my life.
1699140	1702140	The next time you come, you should come with Ian Bowers.
1702140	1703140	Who's Ian Bowers?
1703140	1707140	He's this guy who comes here sometimes and does a million things,
1707140	1711140	and maybe occasionally drops by here, like if it's convenient.
1711140	1713140	And I wrote a song for him.
1713140	1714140	Oh, I see.
1714140	1715140	Yeah, yeah.
1715140	1719140	Yeah, I'm really glad that the show I'm on opens with a five-minute thing
1719140	1722140	about drinking piss.
1722140	1725140	Oh, this is the Graham Lenihan episode.
1725140	1728140	Do you want some vodka?
1728140	1729140	No, I'm OK.
1729140	1731140	It's made with potatoes.
1731140	1732140	I went to that.
1732140	1735140	I know it's not whiskey, but it's made with potatoes.
1735140	1737140	Now, when you're talking backstage, Graham,
1737140	1739140	I think I mentioned this last time you were on,
1739140	1742140	but I'm a huge Father Ted fan, which is one of your early shows.
1742140	1743140	Was that your first one?
1743140	1745140	25 years ago now.
1745140	1747140	Yeah, was that the first show that you created?
1747140	1750140	No, we did one before that called Paris,
1750140	1754140	which was a sitcom about artists in the 1920s in Paris.
1754140	1758140	If you've not seen Father Ted, please just get on Father Ted.
1758140	1759140	It's really funny.
1759140	1760140	It's really, really good.
1760140	1761140	Thank you.
1761140	1763140	Are you saying, kind of like in that loop thing
1763140	1765140	where you keep doing the same thing,
1765140	1767140	that two of your actors died on the same date?
1767140	1768140	That's right.
1768140	1769140	Yeah, Frank left us.
1769140	1771140	Father Jack left us this year.
1771140	1772140	On the same day?
1772140	1773140	Yeah.
1773140	1774140	Which is what date?
1774140	1775140	Oh, God, I can't remember.
1775140	1776140	I don't try and remember.
1776140	1778140	You should find out, because you might be next.
1778140	1779140	No, no.
1779140	1781140	But Arnold's getting a bit nervous.
1781140	1783140	There's just two left, but they're still young,
1783140	1786140	so it's going to be okay for a while, I hope.
1786140	1789140	But anyway, you can cut things in this, can't you?
1789140	1791140	No, it all stays.
1791140	1794140	If we're not cutting the pee and poo song, that's staying anyway.
1794140	1798140	I just have one more question about Ireland.
1799140	1800140	Where's my wife?
1804140	1805140	She's your ex-wife now.
1805140	1806140	Well, okay, yeah.
1806140	1808140	But it's like, she went to Ireland.
1808140	1809140	She never came back.
1809140	1810140	Really?
1810140	1812140	I think she's still over there.
1812140	1813140	I don't know.
1813140	1814140	She's in Edinburgh.
1814140	1816140	I just thought that would be a funny joke, kind of.
1816140	1817140	It was.
1817140	1818140	It was great.
1818140	1819140	I think I lost my wife.
1819140	1822140	But she did, yeah, she was in Ireland for a while.
1822140	1823140	Right, right.
1823140	1824140	Okay.
1825140	1828140	Do you blame Ireland for stealing your ex-wife?
1828140	1831140	Well, it's a beautiful country.
1832140	1835140	It's flowing green hills, acts so innocent.
1835140	1836140	Yeah.
1836140	1837140	And then they bird dog you.
1837140	1842140	We went to a comedian once in the States and somewhere, where was it?
1842140	1843140	New York.
1843140	1847140	And the guy said, who was doing the where are you from business?
1847140	1849140	And he said it to us, and we said Ireland.
1849140	1850140	And he obviously wasn't expecting it.
1850140	1852140	He was expecting a state.
1852140	1853140	Right.
1853140	1855140	And he said, oh, I flew over there once.
1855140	1856140	Very green.
1856140	1858140	He flew over Ireland.
1858140	1864140	A weather station worker headed for John Carpenter's The Thing.
1864140	1865140	He flew over Ireland.
1865140	1866140	Where's he going?
1866140	1867140	Yeah, yeah.
1867140	1871140	I don't know where Ireland is, so I thought maybe.
1871140	1874140	It's on the way to John Carpenter's The Thing.
1874140	1875140	Yeah.
1875140	1881140	So, I mean, it's kind of like, so we're hysterical over here right now.
1881140	1886140	And we're kind of like probably not paying very much attention to everything.
1886140	1893140	We're familiar that the UK has Brexited, and we equated that with the right-leaning movement
1893140	1895140	that we've been having over here.
1895140	1897140	Yeah, it's hard.
1897140	1902140	What's really great is that UK people can't feel too superior.
1902140	1903140	Right.
1903140	1904140	No, that's, yeah.
1904140	1905140	Immediately we were making that joke.
1905140	1908140	They were like, at least the British won't be making fun of us during all of this.
1908140	1909140	Yeah.
1910140	1912140	It's super hard.
1912140	1920140	But you're Irish, but I'm curious, like, how is Scotland feeling about Brexit?
1920140	1922140	I've never had, well, I mean...
1922140	1929140	Scotland's in a weird position because Scotland recently voted to remain part of the United Kingdom.
1929140	1930140	Right.
1930140	1931140	And then Brexit happened.
1931140	1932140	Right.
1932140	1933140	And now it's going to happen again.
1933140	1935140	They're probably going to want to get out now.
1935140	1938140	So it's kind of, there's all sorts of insane things.
1938140	1943140	The other thing they didn't take into account at all was the Northern Ireland situation.
1943140	1949140	It was a very fragile piece that's lasted only, you know, a couple of decades now,
1949140	1952140	and they've just rolled the dice on it.
1952140	1953140	So it's really odd.
1953140	1954140	What's the deal?
1954140	1958140	Why is that so fragile?
1958140	1960140	Why would Brexit affect you?
1960140	1965140	Because the border in Northern Ireland, that separates Ireland from Northern Ireland,
1965140	1968140	is what's called a soft border at the moment.
1968140	1973140	You can, you know, pass from Northern Ireland to Southern Ireland without going through, you know,
1973140	1974140	a lot of controls and so on.
1974140	1978140	But that's going to have to change because Ireland's going to be part of the European Union
1978140	1980140	and Northern Ireland isn't.
1980140	1981140	Ah, of course.
1981140	1982140	Yeah. Okay.
1982140	1983140	It's just insane.
1983140	1984140	But it's one of these things.
1984140	1990140	It's kind of like what happened, I think, as well with what's happening in the States,
1990140	1998140	in that people just started realizing, oh, maybe people aren't really clever.
1998140	2003140	Maybe the people we trust, oh, they do this so they know what they're doing.
2003140	2005140	Maybe they aren't really that clever.
2005140	2008140	Maybe they're kind of crazy, some of them, you know?
2008140	2010140	Yeah, which is an uplifting feeling, right?
2010140	2012140	But you can't call it uplifting.
2012140	2013140	It has been this week, as you say.
2013140	2014140	I've liked this week.
2014140	2015140	Is it like watching them?
2015140	2019140	Because it's like the insinuation is that, yeah, they can't do this.
2019140	2022140	The only problem is if there's no one to replace them.
2022140	2027140	I mean, if there's no one clever to replace them, then what do we do?
2027140	2030140	And they've already said they will not be replaced.
2030140	2032140	They were saying that and everything.
2032140	2034140	This was a good week, though, I think.
2034140	2035140	I feel good about this week.
2035140	2041140	Well, because it turns out, yeah, I guess what it is is it's weird because I'm 44 now,
2042140	2050140	and the 24-year-old version of me, God knows where I'd be in this map,
2050140	2055140	because I would throw my Writers Guild magazines across the room
2055140	2058140	when I saw the diversity report card in the magazine,
2058140	2062140	and I'd go, why are they spending my money?
2062140	2063140	Who cares about diversity?
2063140	2065140	It should be a meritocracy.
2065140	2068140	Writers should be, you want the best writer for the job?
2069140	2072140	And everything made sense to me.
2072140	2074140	If you hooked me up to a lie detector test,
2074140	2080140	it's not like I ever would have said, I'm racist and it would have gone bingy's right.
2080140	2083140	It wasn't racism, it was kind of like, I don't know,
2083140	2086140	I don't want to use such a haughty word as ignorance or something,
2086140	2089140	but it was just like my scope was kind of small at that time.
2089140	2090140	I was also broke.
2090140	2097140	Nothing makes you more susceptible to this kind of right-leaning,
2097140	2101140	toothy philosophy like being fucking unemployed
2101140	2103140	and having no control over your future.
2103140	2105140	It's pretty easy then to...
2105140	2110140	Yeah, it makes it hard to be too joyous about all these idiots losing their jobs
2110140	2116140	because while it's short-term, it's great to see them losing their jobs long-term.
2116140	2119140	You've got to think, well, what are these idiots going to do next?
2119140	2121140	Where have they got to go?
2121140	2127140	I blame it all on heavy metal not really being a thing anymore.
2127140	2131140	I think in the old days, they just all have been listening to Iron Maiden
2131140	2133140	and everything would be fine.
2133140	2139140	You lose a lot of energy headbanging and these kind of releases...
2139140	2143140	That's why Scandinavia is so chill because they've got loads of metal up there.
2143140	2144140	They love their metal.
2145140	2150140	That stuff got replaced with kind of methy club music and now all of a sudden...
2150140	2155140	But do you remember, wasn't there a period where in a stadium or something
2155140	2157140	they burnt disco records in the 70s?
2157140	2159140	Right, that was a big thing, hating disco.
2159140	2161140	I think it's the same kind of people.
2163140	2168140	I just think there was a time when the internet wasn't around,
2168140	2175140	everyone was able to channel it into one of about, let's say, 15 activities.
2175140	2181140	And now they can channel it into this weird kind of performance arc
2181140	2185140	that they're just realizing has real consequences.
2185140	2190140	I'm very fascinated by why it's happened and why it's...
2190140	2194140	One thing I'm wondering is, are there going to be a lot of these guys
2194140	2200140	who, with the death in Charlottesville, are there a lot of these irony kind of Nazis
2200140	2204140	who are going to just suddenly go, oh, you know, and back away from it?
2204140	2206140	That's something that I'm interested in.
2206140	2208140	I think a certain percentage is that I think a certain...
2208140	2211140	I don't think anybody's going to be really drawn to it that much.
2211140	2215140	There's no, maybe like Norman Bates or something.
2215140	2223140	I think the percentage of people that are into that kind of hardcore right wing philosophy,
2223140	2226140	that number probably stays around the same.
2226140	2228140	Yeah, they were all in that bandstand.
2228140	2232140	They feel a little liberated right now to come out there without their costumes on
2232140	2235140	and to come out and let that flag fly.
2235140	2238140	But that bandstand was great, the visual of that bandstand.
2238140	2243140	The thing is, I've gone from being very optimistic and very joyful about the internet.
2243140	2247140	There's a comedian called David O'Daugherty who describes it like,
2247140	2252140	the internet used to be like this telescope that we'd look up and see, you know,
2252140	2255140	other people in other lives and it was amazing.
2255140	2258140	And now it's like a shit pipe.
2258140	2263140	And every day you look up and you think, oh, I wonder what's coming down the shit pipe.
2263140	2265140	Yeah, that's not...
2265140	2270140	The millennial generation, as much as I say they're dumb and whatever and poop on them
2270140	2272140	because I'm an old man saying, get off my line.
2272140	2276140	But the thing to pity about them is that they've been born into a culture that...
2276140	2280140	We're processing everything through time to get on the internet.
2280140	2284140	The internet will always be a second language to us.
2284140	2287140	We'll always be translating real life into the internet and vice versa.
2287140	2293140	And these poor kids, often it's characterized as a fire hose to the face of information.
2293140	2297140	And we always thought, I think when you and I were kids,
2297140	2301140	we probably thought when we think about the future and we think about minds connecting to each other,
2301140	2304140	we always thought that that meant everyone would get smarter and more patient.
2304140	2309140	But you wouldn't even have the option.
2309140	2312140	The information would be all up in your face,
2312140	2317140	which would automatically make you less this, less that, less that.
2317140	2319140	But it turns out that...
2319140	2322140	And it makes sense now that we're seeing it that that doesn't make the case,
2322140	2328140	that that's not the case because it's like if everything is bullshit,
2328140	2330140	which it would appear to be.
2330140	2338140	I mean, there is no way to represent truth without creating your own version, blah, blah, blah.
2338140	2343140	But that doesn't mean you can say the earth is flat and have Spencer not make fun of you.
2343140	2347140	It just means that I think we've...
2347140	2352140	It's like we live in this age now where we're back to the propaganda kind of consciousness,
2352140	2356140	but now we're conscious of it and conscious of the consciousness.
2356140	2358140	And now everyone is just sort of...
2358140	2362140	Everyone's just going like, yeah, propaganda's a thing, so what's your propaganda?
2362140	2363140	What's yours?
2363140	2367140	And there's the only people left that are saying there's an objective truth.
2367140	2369140	They're kind of like...
2369140	2373140	They're more right than everybody else because they're calm and educated,
2373140	2376140	but they're also incredibly frustrated because they're like,
2376140	2381140	wait, how are you people just dancing to a completely different song that's not even playing?
2381140	2382140	And they're like, because it is.
2382140	2385140	And you're like, well, can't argue with that.
2386140	2391140	It's almost like when I first started thinking about this seriously,
2391140	2394140	I thought, oh, we are now plugged into a consciousness.
2394140	2397140	I mean, the hive mind is the word that we all use for it,
2397140	2402140	but it really is like we are also plugged into the consciousness of a lot of...
2402140	2405140	They might as well be bees.
2405140	2406140	It's just like a buzzing.
2406140	2408140	You shouldn't know what...
2408140	2411140	None of us should know what blackmailing is.
2411140	2413140	Only some of us do.
2413140	2418140	I mean, there's an argument to me that you and I shouldn't know how many stray dogs there are in Los Angeles.
2418140	2419140	You know?
2419140	2422140	Like someone else would say, yes, you should know that.
2422140	2425140	You need to be aware because that's a huge problem because that's their thing.
2425140	2427140	And they're like, yeah, why would you not want to know?
2427140	2432140	That's why there's 75 million of them is because you didn't know and you didn't care.
2432140	2433140	So now, thank God, you know.
2433140	2436140	Then you had 900 things like that.
2436140	2438140	How do you not become a nihilist?
2438140	2443140	When you just know everything and everything is death.
2443140	2444140	Yes.
2444140	2445140	Everything is misery.
2445140	2447140	There's no real fairy tale.
2447140	2456140	There's no actual NBA all-star who goes home to his wife and kids and eats an apple pie.
2456140	2460140	I don't know what our definition of a hero is, but sooner or later...
2460140	2464140	His name is Kevin Durant.
2464140	2466140	But here's the thing.
2466140	2467140	So that's a funny...
2467140	2471140	I mean, yeah, that's the Mobius strip of this is that with this...
2471140	2478140	As shit gets more and more scary, the bar for heroism, I almost don't want to say it
2478140	2480140	lowers like it takes less of a hero.
2480140	2484140	But yeah, I mean, it's just like the minimum standard.
2484140	2486140	It becomes higher in that way.
2486140	2490140	And then we re-enter a world where people are kind of like walking tall and like saying
2490140	2491140	gallant things.
2491140	2493140	I think that's a good thing.
2493140	2495140	Well, did you see the two newsreaders?
2495140	2501140	I don't know what channel it was, but it was one of rare times when they took a Trump mouthpiece
2501140	2505140	and said every single point he tried to make, they said, no, no, that's not true.
2505140	2506140	That's a lie.
2506140	2507140	Did you see those guys?
2507140	2508140	That one.
2508140	2509140	It's a great video.
2509140	2510140	It's well worth checking out.
2510140	2511140	I wish I could remember.
2511140	2514140	Did you see the person that played a tuba next to the...
2514140	2515140	Yeah.
2515140	2522140	Did you see today the woman doing that to the civil...
2522140	2523140	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2523140	2524140	Was that from...
2524140	2527140	Then someone did a video of it, like a Ken Burns thing?
2527140	2528140	Yeah, yeah, the Ken Burns thing.
2528140	2529140	Yeah, yeah.
2529140	2530140	So good.
2530140	2531140	That was the kind of internet I thought we would have.
2531140	2536140	I thought it was going to be a great kind of outpouring of creativity, you know?
2536140	2541140	But the unfortunate thing is that right-wing people aren't funny, and they don't have a
2541140	2542140	sense of humor.
2542140	2544140	That's not even a controversial thing to say.
2544140	2546140	No, they're not funny.
2546140	2548140	So they think like...
2548140	2549140	How do you pronounce it?
2549140	2550140	I don't think I've ever said it in real life.
2550140	2551140	Pete or pet?
2551140	2552140	Or Pepe.
2552140	2553140	Pepe.
2553140	2554140	Oh, Pepe.
2554140	2555140	Pepe.
2555140	2556140	So if they do a Pepe, I don't think I've ever said it.
2556140	2560140	I've never had reason to, because people I know have liars.
2560140	2568140	But, you know, to have an image of Pepe putting someone in a gas chamber, you know, it's not
2568140	2570140	funny on any level.
2570140	2571140	Right.
2571140	2575140	Well, that's why they keep retreating to meta, meta, meta, meta.
2575140	2577140	Oh, it's funny in a way you don't understand.
2577140	2582140	I'm 15 years old, and I don't believe in God, and I'm moments from shooting up a school,
2582140	2584140	maybe, maybe not, hardy-hard-hard.
2584140	2587140	Here's a gif of a Chinese baby getting run over in a parking lot.
2587140	2590140	I jerked off to it.
2590140	2594140	The only cool thing about those terrifying children is...
2594140	2597140	He didn't really jerk off to that.
2597140	2599140	It's a fictional character I'm making up.
2599140	2610140	But it's like that thing where they're never more than one shocked reaction away from revealing
2610140	2611140	that that's all part of the joke.
2611140	2612140	Yeah.
2612140	2613140	And it's like this kind of odd...
2613140	2614140	Yeah.
2614140	2616140	It's like celebrating being...
2616140	2624140	It's like, well, we kind of pinned a medal on, for instance, gangster rap when it was
2624140	2630140	the 90s, and it was like we're going from rapping about peas and carrots to all of a sudden
2630140	2635140	this person saying the N-word a lot and the F-word even more and the C-word and everything,
2635140	2638140	and he's talking about shooting other people and all this stuff, and the parents are like,
2638140	2639140	oh, my God.
2639140	2646140	And the defense of that is, well, we're just showing you how it is.
2646140	2647140	Yeah.
2647140	2652140	We're expressing something that's going on, and it's kind of hard to argue with that.
2652140	2656140	In fact, in the right cultural context, we applaud that.
2656140	2659140	So now you've got these kids who are like...
2659140	2662140	Yeah, but they're not showing anything that's going on.
2662140	2663140	They're showing what's going on.
2663140	2669140	They're showing what's going on to the human mind under the influence of a global culture,
2669140	2671140	which is absolute warpage.
2671140	2678140	They're showing what's going on when your parents don't hit you enough.
2678140	2679140	Maybe that's a joke.
2679140	2680140	See?
2681140	2682140	But they're showing...
2682140	2684140	You've got to hit your children, people.
2684140	2685140	You've got to hit them.
2685140	2693140	They're showing how a primate reacts to being part of an 8 billion light bulb Christmas
2693140	2697140	display, and it ain't pretty.
2697140	2700140	I'm not saying it's excusable at all.
2700140	2701140	I went on holiday.
2701140	2702140	I went offline for a while.
2702140	2704140	It was really good.
2704140	2707140	I realized my mood was much better.
2708140	2714140	My son noticed that when I was going back online, I was getting anxious.
2714140	2715140	Oh, dude.
2715140	2716140	It's crazy, man.
2716140	2721140	Twitter, which is the only thing I actually do go to online, because Reddit's too...
2721140	2723140	I try not to go online.
2723140	2725140	It's an actual fucking...
2725140	2729140	It's gotten to a point where, for real, it wouldn't even be a funny episode of intervention.
2729140	2734140	It would actually be an understandable one, because it truly is this toxic thing I'm doing
2734140	2735140	to myself.
2735140	2736140	You feel like you're helping as well.
2736140	2738140	You feel like, oh, if I retweet this...
2738140	2743140	It's giving you a sense of order and justice and also community and feelings and all this
2743140	2744140	stuff.
2744140	2745140	You cannot fucking...
2745140	2751140	I keep hitting that goddamn app, and then I'll delete it for a couple days, and then
2751140	2757140	I'll be cuddling with Cody and laughing and all this stuff, and then somehow it'll come
2757140	2761140	up, because it's embedded in a web page where you click on a thing and you're back on Twitter.
2761140	2762140	I'm like fucking...
2762140	2763140	I'm just...
2763140	2765140	I'm like snapping at people.
2765140	2768140	I said I want my eggs poached!
2768140	2775140	If I haven't seen Dan for a few days, I can tell if Dan is on a New York to LA flight
2775140	2779140	and drunk, because there's nine million tweets.
2779140	2783140	You're trapped on a plane and something got under your skin.
2783140	2790140	Also, another unfortunate thing about it is how fast time passes when you're on it.
2790140	2792140	Sometimes I realize...
2792140	2799140	I saw a sketch by these two guys that I really liked, and I just sent a direct message to
2799140	2801140	them, and I said, great sketch.
2801140	2803140	They rolled back and said, oh, thank you.
2803140	2809140	Then I saw, because I'd written a direct message to him, I saw that the previous message to
2809140	2814140	him had said something similar about an earlier one he did five years ago.
2814140	2815140	Oh, wow.
2816140	2822140	Two conversations with these guys, and five years have passed in between these two conversations,
2822140	2824140	and it feels like I blinked.
2824140	2827140	It feels like I looked down at Twitter and when I looked up, everyone's...
2827140	2829140	My kids are 10 years old.
2829140	2834140	And a US president used it to get elected, and he continues.
2834140	2836140	That's a really telling thing.
2836140	2839140	We're going to look back at this and go, this is like having mercury in your food or something.
2839140	2841140	I'm not saying everybody get off of Twitter.
2841140	2847140	Obviously, wouldn't that be great if we all realized one app was somehow the thing?
2847140	2851140	Twitter is a really easy example of it because Trump clearly got addicted to it.
2851140	2853140	It's like blood magic.
2853140	2855140	Yeah, hashtag.
2855140	2861140	It's like this weird magic that gets in your body and then it kind of takes you over.
2861140	2863140	That guy can't...
2863140	2865140	We've all been saying it over and over again.
2865140	2867140	He can't stay off Twitter.
2867140	2872140	He got elected through it, so why would he stop?
2872140	2874140	And I feel exactly the same way.
2874140	2883140	I didn't get elected, but I keep feeling like, well, my life up till now has gotten where it is with Twitter in my pocket.
2883140	2887140	I've tweeted my life, and it's fucking insane.
2887140	2891140	I used to blog, n-word.
2891140	2895140	I used to express myself in prose.
2895140	2899140	He used to not say n-word.
2899140	2903140	He said the n-word.
2903140	2913140	By the way, let's trade my leader is so dumb, because again, we're not totally in tune.
2913140	2923140	My president revealed today absolutely unequivocally, totally empirically, including multiple peer-reviewed control groups,
2923140	2927140	and in the scientific lab, he didn't know how to spell the word heal.
2927140	2932140	And then it was scientifically proven, because he deleted it twice.
2932140	2933140	You know about this, right?
2933140	2934140	I do not.
2934140	2939140	He wrote, our country will heal, we're going to heal the country, so multiple times.
2939140	2941140	He wrote heal twice.
2941140	2943140	So heal was twice in the tweet.
2943140	2945140	But he gave it doubly.
2945140	2952140	Then the tweet was deleted, and then reposted, same spelling, and then deleted again.
2952140	2963140	This is in the span of 36 minutes that the leader of the free world, as we used to call it, is figuring out homonyms.
2963140	2965140	Forget about North Korea.
2965140	2967140	I got that figured out, fire and fury.
2967140	2977140	Now, if I say dear mom in a letter, why has she got no antlers?
2977140	2978140	Harvard?
2978140	2980140	Where did he go?
2980140	2981140	Didn't he go to fucking college?
2981140	2982140	He went in college?
2982140	2983140	I dropped out.
2983140	2985140	I don't know where he went.
2985140	2986140	He probably went to college.
2986140	2987140	He's a college graduate.
2987140	2990140	And consensus is he kind of just bought his way through.
2990140	2993140	Well, yeah, but how can that be...
2993140	2994140	That's fucking insane.
2994140	2995140	Yeah, he couldn't go to college.
2995140	2998140	He was too busy not fighting in Vietnam.
2998140	3002140	Anyways, so give us a...
3002140	3005140	Oh, I'm not sure there's anything.
3005140	3008140	Like, everyone knows how to spell.
3008140	3009140	That's kind of the base.
3009140	3012140	In Europe, the idiots know how to spell.
3012140	3016140	They do know how to spell, but that's almost...
3016140	3019140	It's almost worse in a way because, as I say, that kind of level of,
3019140	3024140	oh, people, they don't seem to know what they're doing is disguised
3024140	3026140	by their ability to spell.
3026140	3027140	You know what I mean?
3027140	3028140	Right.
3028140	3034140	So you don't really see how disastrous everything is.
3034140	3038140	Boris Johnson and the pen, they can spell, but they're still villains.
3038140	3039140	Yeah.
3039140	3042140	Well, you're right about that because whether or not they realize it or not,
3042140	3044140	it just so flies in the face of...
3044140	3047140	I think Malcolm X had some quote of...
3047140	3052140	I think it was him that said something that's underneath...
3052140	3057140	Something about that racism gets a stronger reaction
3057140	3061140	when there's a suspicion that it's valid or something like that.
3061140	3063140	I can't remember the actual quote.
3063140	3066140	He was speaking to the fact that we all know in common psychology,
3066140	3071140	which is like, if you're truly fucking, you know the score
3071140	3074140	and you're cool and objective truth is on your side
3074140	3078140	and life is fair to you, and someone calls you honky,
3078140	3081140	you're like, yeah, and...
3081140	3086140	But if the cards are not stacked in your favor and all these things
3086140	3089140	and then someone says something fucked up to you,
3089140	3091140	your anger could be...
3091140	3094140	It's buoyed by the, as he put it, I think,
3094140	3098140	suspicion of its validity or something like that.
3098140	3101140	So now you have this kind of right-wing movement which says,
3101140	3102140	what?
3102140	3105140	It's predicated on this idea that in America, first of all,
3105140	3108140	there was a golden age, fascism 101,
3108140	3111140	the reference to it of some fucking vague golden age
3111140	3113140	that no one will ever be pinned down on.
3113140	3115140	Make America great again.
3115140	3117140	When was it great?
3117140	3119140	They will never answer that question.
3119140	3120140	1983.
3120140	3121140	OK.
3121140	3123140	Well, now that you said that, I'm going to show you charts.
3123140	3124140	Fake news.
3124140	3130140	But, like, it's this idea that, you know,
3130140	3133140	whiteness is better, America's better,
3133140	3134140	America's a white country.
3134140	3137140	The Statue of Liberty only says huddled masses on the bottom of it
3137140	3139140	because there was a poetry contest.
3139140	3140140	Like, come on, that was...
3140140	3141140	We've never meant that.
3141140	3142140	That was co-opted.
3142140	3143140	That was...
3143140	3145140	Michelle Obama turned that into a thing.
3145140	3146140	Also, she's green.
3146140	3148140	She's not even white.
3148140	3152140	But when they can't spell first grade English,
3152140	3154140	it does help.
3154140	3160140	Like, because you could be still a 90 IQ anti-immigration politician
3160140	3163140	and just by virtue of boarding school,
3163140	3164140	you could spell the word heal.
3164140	3167140	Pence is really dangerous.
3167140	3168140	Yeah.
3168140	3169140	For that reason.
3169140	3172140	Everyone moderate who now knows how many doors can be opened
3172140	3174140	and how quickly and how far they are allowed to go
3174140	3175140	before anyone cries.
3175140	3176140	Uncle is dangerous now.
3176140	3177140	Everyone is dangerous.
3177140	3181140	It's really frightening to me that Pence would never have got
3181140	3184140	within miles of the White House if he hadn't snuck in
3184140	3187140	under Donald's fart cloud, you know?
3187140	3189140	There's no way.
3189140	3190140	Donald's fart cloud?
3190140	3191140	Yeah.
3191140	3192140	Is that what you said?
3192140	3193140	It's like a protective thing.
3193140	3195140	I'm writing that down.
3195140	3197140	That's the new series you're pitching while you're here.
3197140	3198140	Wait, wait, wait.
3198140	3199140	I don't know.
3199140	3201140	But, you know, he wouldn't be...
3201140	3202140	He wouldn't be...
3202140	3203140	No one would lie.
3203140	3206140	He's even visibly disturbing.
3206140	3210140	There's something very kind of Stephen King villain about him,
3210140	3211140	you know?
3211140	3214140	And he just wouldn't have got in.
3214140	3215140	And now what?
3215140	3219140	He's going to be in power for three years, you know?
3219140	3222140	I mean, that's something I'm a little bit worried about,
3222140	3223140	you know?
3223140	3225140	More worried in a weird way than Donald because I'm kind of
3225140	3229140	enjoying watching Donald become the biggest loser of all time.
3229140	3230140	Yeah.
3230140	3231140	But there could be a thing here.
3231140	3233140	It could be like a defribulation, a near-death experience
3233140	3235140	where coming out of it no matter what happens
3235140	3238140	as politics resumes being politics and becomes even more dangerous
3238140	3240140	because it stops being a rodeo clown.
3240140	3245140	That the woke, the millennials, the younger people even than them
3245140	3247140	have now experienced this thing of like,
3247140	3252140	are you telling me that becoming the president is, first of all,
3252140	3255140	not a contest that you win by being a good person,
3255140	3259140	not a contest you even win by being good at that job.
3259140	3263140	But most importantly, it actually holds no reward.
3264140	3268140	If you actually just blunder into it and start throwing birthday
3268140	3271140	parties for yourself, people, you will become more hated
3271140	3274140	than if you had just stayed a manager at Burger King.
3274140	3277140	And therefore, maybe there are more important things going on in my world
3277140	3281140	than winning this weird Highlander contest of who can be the biggest douche.
3281140	3284140	Like, and then maybe, I don't know.
3284140	3288140	But let's talk about, like, I want to talk to you as a writer
3288140	3290140	so I can pretend that I'm one.
3291140	3292140	Vice versa.
3292140	3296140	Are you finding it difficult to write period?
3296140	3298140	Like, right now?
3298140	3300140	Yeah, kind of. I mean...
3300140	3302140	Good. Okay, good.
3302140	3304140	No, I think it's...
3304140	3306140	What's the problem? What's the problem with it?
3306140	3309140	Because life is a fucking screenplay?
3309140	3310140	Yeah, yeah.
3310140	3313140	And you can't type fade in on a guy finding magic shoes?
3313140	3314140	There's interesting things.
3314140	3317140	It's like, well, do the shoes turn into Hitler heads?
3317140	3320140	Because otherwise I'm beaten by...
3320140	3322140	But I think you might suffer from that worse than me
3322140	3329140	because I think you've got... I think you're in a great way very cerebral.
3329140	3333140	And I think that you don't like... You hate... Like Tim and Eric, I know,
3333140	3336140	have this thing where I think they said once that a lot of their style
3336140	3339140	just comes from them being terrified of boring people.
3339140	3342140	So they have that kind of very insane style that...
3342140	3344140	I have no such fear.
3345140	3349140	But like, you know, your stuff is very aware of itself, you know?
3349140	3351140	It's very aware of what it's doing, you know?
3351140	3356140	I try and suppress that for a first draft.
3356140	3357140	You know what I mean?
3357140	3359140	Sometimes successfully and sometimes not.
3359140	3363140	But it's harder to do that these days because...
3363140	3364140	It's like what you were saying.
3364140	3369140	I think you said about Rick and Morty that you were going to have a big secret
3369140	3373140	but you decided not to because the internet would figure it out before...
3373140	3374140	And did.
3374140	3376140	And did, yeah, yeah.
3376140	3378140	And that's kind of the problem.
3378140	3385140	It's like you're competing now against a giant wasp brain, you know?
3385140	3386140	That is the world.
3386140	3388140	And that makes it a little bit more difficult to do
3388140	3391140	the necessity of a boring first draft.
3391140	3392140	Do you know what I mean?
3392140	3393140	Yeah.
3393140	3395140	But I still... I'll tell you what I'm doing.
3395140	3396140	That's helping.
3396140	3398140	I'm watching a lot of cheers.
3400140	3401140	That helps.
3401140	3403140	Because you look at Coach and you just think,
3403140	3405140	I want to write someone like Coach.
3405140	3406140	Right.
3406140	3407140	You know?
3407140	3408140	I love him.
3408140	3411140	But Graham, the show you're working on now is...
3411140	3412140	What's it called?
3412140	3413140	The...
3413140	3414140	We just did a show...
3414140	3415140	Counter Author Strong.
3415140	3416140	Counter Author Strong, yeah.
3416140	3420140	Which is this really funny guy played by Steve Delaney
3420140	3424140	who we had three years on BBC One
3424140	3428140	where I might as well have just thrown every episode down a crevasse
3428140	3430140	because they didn't repeat it and...
3430140	3432140	But when you're writing...
3432140	3435140	Oh, please don't let me stop complaining about that.
3435140	3440140	Just die there and I'll look like I'm blaming everyone but ourselves.
3440140	3442140	When you're writing your stuff,
3442140	3446140	are you writing for mostly a UK audience or...?
3446140	3449140	Yeah, but I'm hoping that everything travels
3449140	3452140	the way the IT grad and TED is kind of traveling a little bit.
3452140	3453140	You know?
3453140	3454140	The IT grad especially.
3454140	3456140	But you're not hopefully writing to try to please
3456140	3457140	a certain kind of audience.
3457140	3459140	You're just writing what you like.
3459140	3461140	No, I guess...
3461140	3463140	I was always really...
3463140	3466140	I mean, I don't want to speak ill of any show
3466140	3469140	but I always preferred Seinfeld to Curb
3469140	3472140	because for me, Seinfeld,
3472140	3477140	because it had to navigate the kind of strictures of, you know,
3477140	3479140	commercial network TV,
3479140	3483140	for me, it was like a Cole Porter song or something.
3483140	3486140	It was just a bit more elegant than Curb for me.
3486140	3488140	Because of the constraints.
3488140	3490140	Yeah, because of the constraints.
3490140	3492140	And I felt that the performances were stronger
3492140	3494140	and the whole thing together.
3494140	3499140	I like the elegance and I like when things are difficult.
3499140	3501140	So with Count Arthur, for instance,
3501140	3505140	you know, we don't curse because kids love him, you know?
3505140	3507140	So writing...
3507140	3509140	And one of my favorite things,
3509140	3511140	which I think I've spoken about before on this show,
3511140	3514140	but one of my favorite things is taking taboo subjects
3514140	3518140	and making them palatable to a family audience.
3518140	3521140	I think that's a really funny thing when you get it right.
3521140	3524140	And I thought Seinfeld did that beautifully, you know?
3524140	3526140	They're incest episodes, amazing.
3526140	3528140	And master...
3528140	3530140	She's a brother fucker.
3530140	3532140	She fucks her brother.
3535140	3537140	Oh, yeah.
3537140	3540140	I'd like to be her brother.
3540140	3542140	Giddy up.
3543140	3545140	Why is it that...
3545140	3546140	I mean, you probably can't answer this
3546140	3548140	because it's a question about my own taste.
3548140	3554140	But why do I find English or Irish writers in TV shows?
3554140	3556140	Same reason I like American shows.
3556140	3559140	Toast of London is the funniest goddamn thing in the world.
3559140	3561140	Is it because they sound funny? Is that the answer?
3561140	3564140	You know that's written by Arthur who did Father Ted as well?
3564140	3566140	Yeah.
3566140	3568140	That's a fucking doozy.
3568140	3570140	But that's, you know, it's the same thing.
3571140	3576140	Me and Arthur, we used to watch little clips of Saturday Night Live,
3576140	3578140	which you couldn't see.
3578140	3580140	It wasn't broadcast over where we were,
3580140	3583140	so we would just see little videos of it, you know,
3583140	3585140	later on on YouTube and stuff.
3585140	3587140	But beforehand, they were just on these compilations
3587140	3589140	where they had to show tiny clips
3589140	3591140	because they couldn't use any of the celebrities
3591140	3593140	because they would have to pay them again or something.
3593140	3594140	Wow, weird.
3594140	3596140	So you'd only see like snatches of sketches.
3596140	3598140	Just all Lorraine Newman.
3599140	3605140	But, you know, we would see a sketch like Unfrozen, Caveman, Lawyer.
3607140	3610140	You know, it was like that is the greatest thing.
3610140	3616140	And we just thought they were working on this, you know, really high level
3616140	3620140	and it wasn't until we saw, you know, whole episodes where we realized,
3620140	3623140	oh, okay, it's a little bit more conventional.
3623140	3625140	You grew up on Money Python and we didn't.
3625140	3629140	I saw Money Python piecemeal through like weird syndicated shows
3629140	3630140	in the middle of the night.
3630140	3631140	Yeah.
3631140	3635140	And I saw Python when I was a teenager, so it had that on a kid.
3635140	3638140	So it had a very strong effect on me, probably more of an effect.
3638140	3642140	You know, it's just you see stuff that when it's hard to see,
3642140	3643140	it feels more valuable.
3643140	3644140	Yeah.
3644140	3645140	I didn't know what a budgie was.
3645140	3646140	I didn't know that was a parakeet.
3646140	3648140	I just knew it was a funny word.
3648140	3650140	I just thought they were making shit up.
3650140	3653140	Like they were like, no, that's a thing in England.
3653140	3654140	I didn't know that.
3654140	3657140	Well, half the audience, half the American audience as teenagers
3657140	3658140	probably didn't know what the Spanish Inquisition was.
3658140	3660140	I thought it was, I was like, oh, that's funny.
3660140	3663140	It's a joke from history class, but like, you didn't have to know
3663140	3665140	because it's like, that's the thing.
3665140	3668140	I'm always like, it doesn't matter how many references, you know,
3668140	3669140	like it doesn't matter that.
3669140	3672140	But they were great because they didn't, they didn't seem to have
3672140	3673140	a lot of references.
3673140	3675140	I mean, you know, Python.
3675140	3676140	Yeah.
3676140	3678140	I mean, it was not cultural references.
3678140	3680140	It was all very not pop cultural.
3680140	3681140	Yeah.
3681140	3682140	Like not like of the moment.
3682140	3684140	But they were all culture references to us because we don't know
3684140	3687140	what Yorkshire is and we don't know what Burnley is.
3687140	3690140	But maybe that's why it travels, I don't know.
3690140	3691140	Yeah.
3691140	3694140	I mean, it just, I remember being like a freshman in high school
3694140	3697140	and being in theater class and then we're doing a play
3697140	3700140	and the seniors were all, they all had the secret language
3700140	3702140	and they were all, I found out years later,
3702140	3704140	they were all quoting Monty Python.
3704140	3708140	Somebody had gotten a hold of some tapes or something like that
3708140	3712140	and they would all like, it's just a fish or like,
3712140	3713140	no one expects a Spanish acquisition.
3713140	3715140	I had no idea what they're talking about.
3715140	3719140	I thought they were all just like great friends who had their own like riffs.
3719140	3722140	But like, no, like they were all speaking Monty Python
3722140	3725140	and it was like the punk rock of comedy.
3725140	3727140	Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
3727140	3728140	I'm kind of curious.
3728140	3730140	I still don't think it's been beaten as a sketch show.
3730140	3732140	Is Des here?
3732140	3735140	Our new, he's not here, is he?
3735140	3737140	All right, fine.
3737140	3740140	Jeez, you remember how excited we were of Des, the blind guy?
3740140	3741140	Yeah.
3741140	3742140	And we were like, you should come back
3742140	3746140	and he was like, obviously got in his van and was like, fuck off.
3746140	3747140	I mean, he's blind.
3747140	3750140	He could be anywhere right now.
3750140	3752140	He probably thinks he's at the show.
3752140	3756140	He's probably like, this is, the show's a little light on the left.
3756140	3760140	So he's here.
3760140	3765140	Yeah, but yeah, so, so we talked about like, yeah,
3765140	3766140	finding it harder to write.
3766140	3772140	Now let's talk about what are the, how have the duties changed in writing?
3772140	3777140	If you do manage to write again and you're writing comedy,
3777140	3781140	like how, because the thing is what you're talking about is saying,
3781140	3782140	I'm watching Cheers.
3782140	3783140	Well, good.
3783140	3789140	So you're saying getting back to the craft of just like making people happy.
3789140	3790140	You're right.
3790140	3797140	Like, am I spoiled by the idea that it's okay for things to acknowledge
3797140	3801140	what's happening outside the bubble of television reality?
3801140	3804140	Is it a superior craft to let go?
3804140	3807140	All right.
3807140	3809140	I mean, well, the answer is yes, in my opinion.
3809140	3811140	It's just that I don't know how to do that though.
3811140	3813140	I'm not sure what to, can you rephrase that?
3813140	3816140	Yeah, well, I haven't finished even wrongly phrasing it.
3816140	3819140	He answered his own question that he hadn't quite asked himself.
3819140	3822140	I'm just sort of babbling about it because I'm like, I mean,
3822140	3825140	when you say watching Cheers and like, I'm thinking about like, okay,
3825140	3831140	so like Cheers didn't say there's either socialism or fascism happening
3831140	3833140	outside of the Cheers bar.
3833140	3836140	Cheers might make jokes where if you were an alien society,
3836140	3839140	you could go, it appears they lived in some kind of democratic republic
3839140	3842140	because they just made a joke about a senator.
3843140	3846140	But we did uncount Arthur.
3846140	3847140	It's 9-11.
3847140	3849140	They call out 9-11 when it's 9-11.
3849140	3851140	It's 9-11!
3851140	3854140	I don't know what's gotten into them.
3856140	3858140	Never encouraged it.
3858140	3861140	I don't know if I'm answering the question,
3861140	3864140	but with count Arthur, the thing we just did,
3864140	3871140	we just made the guy who owned the cafe, they all go to Turkish.
3871140	3878140	And we lost a lot of his idiot fans from his previous incarnation,
3878140	3880140	a lot of his idiot racist fans.
3880140	3881140	And that's what we wanted to do.
3881140	3882140	Wait, so he's not Turkish?
3882140	3884140	He plays a Turkish character and fans of his...
3884140	3885140	No, sorry.
3885140	3887140	Steve count Arthur.
3887140	3889140	It was a radio show before it was a TV show.
3889140	3891140	And on the radio show, it was totally different.
3891140	3893140	We reinvented it for the TV.
3893140	3895140	One of the things we put in was this Turkish guy.
3895140	3899140	And so, you know, Steve and I discovered that a lot of racists liked him
3899140	3901140	and they just fucked off, you know?
3901140	3905140	So we just had this kind of nice filter that, you know,
3905140	3909140	we got rid of a lot of people we didn't like just by having a character.
3909140	3911140	That's fucking crazy.
3911140	3912140	But the thing about it...
3912140	3914140	I mean, actually, I hope I'm not exaggerating.
3914140	3915140	There wasn't many.
3915140	3917140	It was just with the internet, you always think there's more than there are.
3917140	3919140	Oh, they're louder because they know.
3919140	3920140	They represent nothing.
3920140	3922140	They know that there's no shows for them.
3922140	3924140	They're fucking desperate.
3924140	3927140	They'll grab a thousand pots and pans and bang them as hard as they can.
3928140	3930140	And you think there's more than there are.
3930140	3932140	But, you know, it was nice to...
3932140	3936140	So I think the whole diversity thing, you know,
3936140	3939140	for us it was a very natural character to have on the show
3939140	3940140	because there's a lot of Turkish...
3940140	3942140	It's a lot like trolling, right?
3942140	3945140	People in London, you know, and it just felt right.
3945140	3947140	You're doing things that in your gut you know,
3947140	3949140	you have a process or you go like,
3949140	3953140	a certain kind of person is going to bump on this and then you dip it.
3953140	3954140	But I genuinely didn't know that would happen.
3954140	3959140	I genuinely didn't think just the appearance of this character in the show
3959140	3963140	would have a lot of people saying, like, we were called politically correct.
3963140	3965140	Just because we had this character in, you know.
3965140	3968140	And I didn't expect that, you know.
3968140	3970140	It was very strange.
3970140	3973140	What was the impulse to make that character Turkish in the first place?
3973140	3975140	Because we knew a lot of Turkish guys who were like that
3975140	3978140	and we thought they were funny, kind of grumpy.
3978140	3981140	You know, a little bit of the soup nazi in there as well.
3981140	3984140	Everything I do is influenced by Seinfeld in some way.
3984140	3987140	So, you know.
3987140	3990140	And we found this brilliant actor who was just...
3990140	3992140	When he never smiled, he was hilarious.
3992140	3996140	So they just wanted the show to be lily white and know...
3996140	3998140	Yeah, because that's how the original was.
3998140	3999140	The radio one.
3999140	4001140	You know, anything that was different to that.
4001140	4004140	And it was a mixed-race relationship.
4004140	4005140	Well, there are people that freak out.
4005140	4008140	It's like, I'm going to say a solid chunk of them.
4008140	4010140	They're not actually...
4010140	4012140	If you change Peter Parker to African American,
4012140	4016140	if you say this character can be female now, if you...
4016140	4020140	I think that there's surely a bunch of people that are like,
4020140	4022140	no, I hate women, you shouldn't do that.
4022140	4025140	And then there's these, like, cousins of theirs
4025140	4027140	who are perfectly comfortable standing next to them
4027140	4030140	because they think that they're such big fans of comedy
4030140	4034140	or sci-fi or comic books or whatever their thing is.
4034140	4037140	They think that they're such big, great fans
4037140	4042140	and that they perceive this agenda
4042140	4044140	that has nothing to do with, for instance,
4044140	4046140	making comic books as cool as they can be,
4046140	4048140	making video games as great as they can be,
4048140	4051140	making movies as funny or as loyal to this or that.
4051140	4053140	And that they...
4053140	4056140	Actually, it's almost like a recruitment thing for them.
4056140	4058140	It's like those guys go,
4058140	4060140	oh, man, Doctor Who's a woman?
4060140	4062140	Like, that ain't Doctor Who.
4062140	4065140	And then there's a Nazi standing in the shadows five feet from there
4065140	4067140	over here.
4067140	4068140	We agree.
4068140	4071140	Doctor Who ain't Doctor Who no more.
4071140	4073140	If it's a Doctor Her, come over here.
4073140	4075140	And they're like, what, what?
4075140	4076140	Yeah, I'm so frustrated.
4076140	4078140	They're like, oh, you don't know the frustration.
4078140	4082140	How many people is six million people?
4082140	4083140	Do you think?
4083140	4084140	That's a lot of people.
4084140	4085140	Exactly.
4085140	4086140	Come here.
4086140	4087140	Just keep walking with me.
4087140	4091140	It's getting awful dark.
4091140	4093140	Not to cast any of those people as innocents,
4093140	4094140	but I do think...
4094140	4097140	I think it's like there's a difference between hate and ignorance.
4097140	4100140	I think that hopefully, because otherwise we've got to just go,
4100140	4102140	oh, there's always hateful people.
4102140	4104140	We might as well be like, fine, they're like white walkers
4104140	4108140	and let's just either eliminate them or let them kill us.
4108140	4110140	No, it's not like that.
4110140	4112140	It's like there's a lot of ignorance at play
4112140	4115140	and people get, at different times in their life,
4115140	4120140	they go like, oh, I hate this idea that feminism is a thing in comedy.
4120140	4122140	I'm sick of reading these articles.
4122140	4123140	I can't.
4123140	4124140	All these headlines.
4124140	4125140	Women, women, women, women, women.
4125140	4127140	I'm so sick of the women.
4127140	4130140	You must not be thinking about comedy very much
4130140	4133140	if you're focused on women being involved.
4133140	4134140	That's not comedy.
4134140	4136140	Comedy should be about the comedy,
4136140	4139140	which is me at 24th throwing that magazine across the room.
4139140	4140140	Yeah.
4140140	4141140	But as far as...
4141140	4144140	I've done it for a long time now.
4144140	4146140	I know I can do a certain type of show.
4146140	4147140	We did Father Ted.
4147140	4152140	It had three male characters and one female character.
4152140	4154140	I know I can do that.
4154140	4157140	It would be interesting to do a show with three female characters
4157140	4160140	and one male character, which we've just done.
4160140	4161140	It's interesting.
4161140	4163140	It just keeps you limber.
4163140	4164140	Well, yeah.
4164140	4165140	I think the important thing is to do that
4165140	4167140	and then have it be fucking awesome
4167140	4172140	because otherwise you realize
4173140	4177140	it's like you're pouring energy into this weird engine
4177140	4180140	that exists where, yeah, I don't even know.
4180140	4182140	That's another half hour conversation.
4182140	4183140	You just know you can do it.
4183140	4184140	You know you can do it.
4184140	4186140	So why do it again?
4186140	4188140	That's why I think diversity is an interest.
4188140	4192140	It's another discipline, you know,
4192140	4194140	and it's another stricture you can put on yourself.
4194140	4196140	I don't know.
4196140	4199140	I think that leads to interesting...
4199140	4202140	As I say, Seinfeld, for me, best example.
4202140	4205140	You can't talk about masturbating on a show,
4205140	4210140	so they come up with three different ways of talking about it.
4210140	4213140	You know, that's where the fun is, you know?
4213140	4215140	So why not embrace it,
4215140	4217140	why not embrace something like diversity
4217140	4221140	as a chance to show what you can do, you know?
4221140	4223140	And I think the other fucking answer is...
4223140	4225140	If not, you know, for the wider reasons.
4225140	4229140	I mean, also, obviously there are good reasons to do it anyway,
4229140	4232140	but for reasons of, you know, artistic reasons,
4232140	4234140	it's a good artistic reason, too.
4234140	4235140	It's a good reason.
4235140	4237140	Yeah, guys like me, I always want to just say,
4237140	4239140	like, don't you want to prove
4239140	4241140	that you're the most talented person in the world?
4241140	4242140	Yeah, yeah.
4242140	4244140	So don't you want all of this nonsense
4244140	4246140	about anyone not having access
4246140	4250140	and any suspicions of an unfair field to be abolished
4250140	4252140	so that at some point in your life you can go,
4252140	4253140	I'm the best writer.
4253140	4257140	There's a flip side to it, though, with the internet, though,
4257140	4259140	which really does annoy me,
4259140	4263140	which is people telling writers what they can and can't write about.
4263140	4265140	That really annoys me.
4265140	4266140	You see that a lot.
4266140	4269140	Like, writers are jukeboxes, you know?
4269140	4272140	And that's a really good argument
4272140	4274140	for unplugging yourself in the internet, you know?
4274140	4276140	The uplifting thing about that, though, is that I go,
4276140	4278140	like, shit, man, no one's going to replace me.
4278140	4279140	This generation is fucked.
4279140	4282140	They think TV's like a faucet.
4282140	4284140	They're just like...
4284140	4287140	So there ain't no 25-year-old Dan Harmon coming down the pike.
4287140	4289140	Do you feel like that, though? Does that worry you?
4289140	4292140	Well, when I see that stuff, that's how I make myself feel better.
4292140	4297140	I'm like, well, if this person can yell at the creator of a show
4297140	4299140	and say, you're not creating it right,
4299140	4302140	then, like, no one's going to...
4302140	4305140	These kids are not equipped to produce a competitor.
4305140	4307140	I really like it, though, isn't it?
4307140	4309140	I've got this terrible twin.
4309140	4311140	Is this boring for everybody?
4311140	4313140	Yeah.
4313140	4315140	I've got this terrible...
4315140	4317140	Someone nodded.
4317140	4319140	And that person? Norman Lear.
4319140	4321140	I've got this...
4321140	4323140	Sorry, Mr. Lear.
4323140	4325140	He comes up with his belt like a wrestler.
4325140	4327140	Yeah, I'm bored.
4327140	4329140	I'm bored of the scene, Mean Jean.
4329140	4332140	I'm bored of these whippersnappers talking about how they should diversify.
4332140	4335140	I think you need to energify.
4335140	4339140	Ain't that right, William?
4340140	4342140	Ain't that...
4342140	4345140	He's a writer, everybody.
4345140	4347140	You can't write.
4347140	4349140	William.
4349140	4352140	I tried to think of another showrunner.
4352140	4354140	I was like, I don't know.
4354140	4357140	I've got this double thing going on
4357140	4361140	where I kind of don't like watching new things
4361140	4363140	because I'm jealous.
4363140	4367140	But at the same time, I really want to see good things.
4367140	4371140	Because when you see good things, it makes you want to write other things.
4371140	4373140	But it's really hard.
4373140	4375140	It's like showering for me.
4375140	4378140	Every time I'm in the shower, I'm like, I should do this all the time.
4378140	4381140	And that's how I feel about halfway through an episode of New Girl.
4381140	4384140	I'm like, why the fuck don't I do this?
4384140	4386140	This is fine.
4386140	4392140	The reason one for me was The Good Place, which I started watching.
4393140	4397140	Because it's just a show, my inclination is not to watch it.
4397140	4399140	I don't know what that fucking is, man.
4399140	4401140	I haven't watched Atlanta yet.
4401140	4403140	You go like Megan Amram, who's really funny.
4403140	4407140	You don't read literature novels or things like that, right?
4407140	4409140	Yeah, I'm a real bookworm.
4409140	4411140	What the fuck?
4411140	4413140	We've talked about this.
4413140	4415140	But I need to ask, though.
4415140	4417140	This is something I tried to ask him on Twitter,
4417140	4420140	and I never get an answer, so I'm going to be able to ask you now.
4421140	4427140	Where does your understanding of the circle come from?
4427140	4429140	Is it from reading Campbell?
4429140	4431140	The first thing I read is that book you mentioned,
4431140	4434140	Christopher Vogler's Writer's Journey,
4434140	4439140	and I always recommend that to young people or old people that have it.
4439140	4442140	I mean new people that are asking me,
4442140	4445140	how do I process the Campbell stuff?
4445140	4449140	I said, read the Vogler book first because it's so...
4449140	4452140	You can read it by numbers, but don't stop there.
4452140	4459140	Having read that, now try to digest Campbell from cover to cover.
4459140	4462140	I bought it today, and I started reading it.
4462140	4464140	Here are some faces.
4464140	4466140	It's tough going, man.
4466140	4469140	Because once you've got Vogler or any other kind of...
4469140	4471140	It's pretty readable, I thought.
4471140	4474140	Actually, there's a chapter or two in there for me that I've had to read and reread.
4474140	4478140	Every paragraph at Campbell writes, you have to reread a thousand times.
4478140	4481140	That's what five and six on the circle is like for me.
4481140	4483140	It gets really dense at one point.
4483140	4486140	He's blowing my mind, I think.
4486140	4489140	My mind has been blown, so my mind doesn't work anymore.
4489140	4492140	He's explaining to you that the concept of mind-blowing
4492140	4495140	reveals to you that you are the mind-blower.
4495140	4499140	You see, I've been asked to go to Australia
4499140	4502140	and talk to people about comedy writing,
4502140	4505140	like to do a course like Robert McKee or something.
4505140	4511140	But the thing is, I'm just copying your blog post about it.
4511140	4513140	But they just want... You know what those guys want down there?
4513140	4515140	I've been down there.
4515140	4519140	They want you to pretend they don't have poisonous spiders.
4519140	4521140	They're very sensitive about that.
4521140	4525140	Apparently there hasn't been a poisonous spider death in 30 years, whatever.
4525140	4531140	I said to them, no other country has that statistic.
4531140	4534140	You protest too much, Australia.
4534140	4538140	But they like you to sound like one of them.
4538140	4540140	So can I teach you a phrase?
4540140	4543140	Oh, wait. Stand back.
4543140	4545140	I like the hat might.
4545140	4547140	Just remember that.
4547140	4552140	If you get into a jam, just go, I like the hat might.
4552140	4556140	You know what? I find suspicious about the Aussies
4556140	4560140	is that they really insist that you don't have any worries.
4560140	4563140	They want you to have no worries at all times.
4563140	4567140	I'm like, that worries me.
4567140	4569140	Yeah, but I don't know.
4569140	4573140	But the thing is, I don't really have a unified theory of writing.
4573140	4577140	My stuff is grabbed from all different places.
4577140	4581140	I'll give you a sneak. There's a cheat.
4581140	4583140	The circle.
4583140	4587140	So just do quadrants now.
4587140	4590140	Top half is...
4590140	4592140	I want to make sure I get this right.
4592140	4594140	No, stop.
4594140	4596140	So top half is good.
4596140	4599140	Appetizers. Just stop.
4599140	4601140	So top half is good.
4601140	4603140	Bottom half is bad.
4603140	4605140	Right half is dishonest.
4605140	4606140	Left half is honest.
4606140	4608140	Oh, no, I know that one. Yeah, I love that.
4608140	4609140	That's great.
4609140	4610140	Because it's just a cheat.
4610140	4611140	I forgot about that.
4611140	4612140	Well, it doesn't even matter.
4612140	4616140	If you think about a banana, okay, so good, dishonest,
4616140	4620140	crossing the threshold into bad, dishonest,
4620140	4623140	and then the goddess midpoint,
4623140	4625140	there's this truth that changes everything.
4625140	4626140	It's like another threshold.
4626140	4632140	You go into honest bad, which is why you get your ass kicked.
4632140	4635140	Because the truth is you suck.
4635140	4639140	And then you recover from that, and now the truth can be that you're good.
4639140	4642140	Can you riff the banana story?
4642140	4644140	Just kind of give us the beats of good?
4644140	4647140	I want to know what bad, dishonest, bananas are.
4647140	4648140	Something to do, right?
4648140	4654140	In my Seth Rogen animated film called Banana Boys,
4654140	4656140	there's a bunch of bananas,
4656140	4662140	and they all agree that getting peeled is the worst.
4662140	4663140	Oh, the worst.
4663140	4664140	It's the worst.
4664140	4666140	So then they try to avoid getting peeled,
4666140	4669140	and then one of them gets peeled,
4669140	4672140	and he has to adapt to getting peeled.
4672140	4674140	So he's like a naked banana,
4674140	4678140	and he's cool with it,
4678140	4684140	and then he finds out that bananas are actually plantains,
4684140	4687140	that he was never a banana.
4687140	4688140	For summer.
4688140	4690140	He was adopted.
4690140	4691140	His parents didn't want him.
4691140	4693140	He just looked like a banana.
4693140	4694140	It doesn't matter, peeled, unpeeled.
4694140	4695140	Go fuck yourself.
4695140	4699140	And then he gets back to the fucking banana story.
4699140	4701140	I'll just tell the Australians that.
4701140	4702140	Yeah.
4703140	4707140	I mean, look, it's never going to sound very great on the whiteboard.
4707140	4712140	But I tell you, that was the biggest change in writing for me
4712140	4716140	was seeing that juicy details post.
4716140	4722140	Once I realized that everything in the second half was the trailer,
4722140	4723140	that's how I describe it to people,
4723140	4727140	that everything in the bottom half is the trailer for that week's episode.
4727140	4730140	And I thought that was just so clear.
4730140	4731140	And as soon as I realized that,
4731140	4733140	you could start filling out the bottom half,
4733140	4736140	and that helps you decide what the top half is.
4736140	4739140	It's so easy and wonderful.
4739140	4741140	It made everything better for me.
4741140	4743140	As you can imagine, if you ran the simulator,
4743140	4746140	as a writer that you admired saying that to you,
4746140	4752140	it hits you in an Oreo of flattery and fucking panic.
4752140	4755140	Because you're like, wait, so then there's going to be some sub-reddit
4755140	4756140	where people say,
4756140	4760140	have you noticed that since Graham said that Dan Harmon changed how he wrote
4760140	4762140	that all his shit sucks or something,
4762140	4764140	like they're going to trace it or something,
4764140	4767140	and I'll be like, I don't want any responsibility.
4767140	4768140	No, no, don't worry.
4768140	4769140	Don't listen to me.
4769140	4771140	I won't tell you the exact point I started.
4773140	4779140	But yeah, they called out 9-11 because we start playing D&D around this time.
4779140	4783140	So stick around and have a drink with me after, or you can...
4783140	4784140	I loved her.
4784140	4785140	I got to meet a friend, so I don't know what he's doing.
4785140	4788140	But I will figure it out.
4788140	4790140	You're giving us an Irish goodbye.
4790140	4791140	That's amazing.
4791140	4793140	We don't usually get the real thing.
4793140	4795140	It's a real Irish goodbye.
4795140	4796140	Yeah.
4796140	4798140	Everybody thank Graham for coming.
4800140	4801140	Grab a hand, everybody.
4801140	4802140	Thank you, Graham.
4809140	4812140	Let's say goodbye to Graham and bring up Steve Levy, everyone.
4812140	4813140	Steve.
4815140	4817140	L.A. Jr. to the stage.
4820140	4821140	Hello, Steve.
4823140	4824140	Hey.
4824140	4825140	Oh, shit.
4826140	4829140	Now I just want to go home and rewatch Father Tech
4829140	4830140	because I got to hang out with the guy that made it.
4830140	4831140	It makes me so happy.
4833140	4834140	Eat.
4834140	4835140	Fuck off.
4836140	4837140	Drink.
4839140	4841140	There's four people that have seen that show.
4841140	4845140	All right, Spencer, do you want to disperse the character sheets here?
4845140	4846140	No.
4848140	4849140	I wish somebody'd go...
4849140	4852140	I always feel bad when I interview people.
4852140	4854140	I don't know how to interview them.
4855140	4856140	Just tell me.
4856140	4858140	How do you think you should interview people?
4858140	4859140	You've been doing this for years.
4859140	4860140	You're great at it.
4860140	4861140	Theoretically.
4861140	4862140	Yeah.
4862140	4863140	Listen to Steve.
4863140	4864140	You're great at it.
4864140	4865140	What do you think is the right thing to do in an interview?
4865140	4866140	I'm just curious.
4868140	4870140	Plumb the depths?
4870140	4872140	Do you think you tend to do that?
4872140	4873140	No.
4873140	4875140	Well, there's a great first step.
4877140	4878140	I don't know.
4878140	4879140	I'm just...
4879140	4880140	I don't know the right answer.
4880140	4881140	I'm trying to work through it with you.
4884140	4885140	Does it feel good?
4889140	4891140	Just play your game.
4892140	4894140	This is why I sequester myself.
4894140	4896140	For other people's benefit.
4897140	4898140	Steve, how you been doing, man?
4899140	4901140	How's your week been?
4901140	4902140	My week?
4902140	4903140	Yeah.
4904140	4905140	I don't know.
4905140	4906140	I can't remember.
4907140	4908140	I think it was a decent week.
4908140	4909140	You overworked, aren't you?
4912140	4913140	Yes.
4914140	4915140	It's fine.
4915140	4916140	It's great.
4916140	4917140	I love it.
4917140	4919140	You're dying a little inside every day, aren't you?
4920140	4921140	Steve's an incel.
4921140	4922140	But he likes it.
4922140	4923140	That's not true.
4923140	4924140	That's not true.
4925140	4926140	He likes dying a little inside.
4926140	4927140	He likes being overwhelmed.
4927140	4928140	I'm telling you, man.
4928140	4929140	I don't...
4929140	4932140	I'm not going to say who it is, Steve, but there is a guy that came to one of our shows.
4932140	4936140	I don't know if it's this one or something else here at the castle.
4936140	4939140	But you got a secret admirer out there who I was like...
4939140	4940140	He's got a lot.
4940140	4942140	I got a big crush on that Steve Levy.
4943140	4945140	They're just all over the place.
4945140	4946140	What?
4946140	4947140	They're just not here.
4947140	4948140	That's the problem.
4948140	4949140	Well, yeah.
4949140	4953140	I don't even admire a woman that is hot for Levy because it's like...
4954140	4955140	It's such an obvious...
4955140	4958140	It's like low-hanging boy candy.
4960140	4961140	That's what I call my balls.
4961140	4962140	It's adorable.
4965140	4966140	It's a boy scout.
4966140	4967140	Like, no.
4967140	4969140	I'll just take this ring to Mordor.
4969140	4970140	I don't care.
4971140	4972140	Yeah, yeah.
4972140	4973140	Yeah, I mean, like...
4973140	4978140	What kind of girl falls for sweet, good-looking guys with biceps?
4978140	4979140	That's what I'm saying.
4979140	4981140	Like, it's like, oh, well...
4982140	4984140	Good luck in pressing me as a woman.
4984140	4986140	If you're hot, for an obvious choice.
4988140	4989140	Go ahead.
4989140	4991140	But I'm just going to be like, well, so...
4991140	4997140	The thing is, the reason why he's so adorable is that he doesn't consider himself an obvious choice.
4997140	4998140	Or do you?
4998140	5000140	Do you secretly go like, I got the fucking goods?
5000140	5001140	No.
5002140	5004140	I don't think I consider myself an obvious choice.
5004140	5005140	So you're like...
5005140	5006140	It's never worked out for me.
5006140	5010140	See, now, I want to fuck you just because that was so charming.
5011140	5012140	He just made me gay.
5013140	5016140	You're saying, Steve, you don't know you're beautiful.
5016140	5018140	And that's why you are?
5020140	5021140	Isn't that the song?
5021140	5022140	Yeah.
5022140	5024140	You don't know you're beautiful.
5024140	5026140	That's what makes you beautiful.
5026140	5027140	You think you're a nerd.
5027140	5028140	The One Direction song?
5028140	5029140	Yeah.
5029140	5031140	You're like Velma.
5032140	5034140	Mary Anne.
5034140	5036140	See, I wear suits because I don't look good in a t-shirt.
5036140	5038140	You can just go out in a t-shirt.
5038140	5039140	Oh, you look good in a t-shirt.
5039140	5042140	You look like young Jewish Paul Newman all the time.
5045140	5047140	Young Jewish Paul Newman.
5049140	5050140	He's fucking...
5050140	5052140	He's Jewish cool hand Luke.
5052140	5053140	You're saying...
5053140	5054140	You're kind of saying...
5054140	5056140	Because Paul Newman was young at one point,
5056140	5059140	so then you can contract that and you can just call him Paul Juman.
5061140	5064140	I mean, that sounds a little more insulting, but yeah, I mean...
5064140	5066140	Ain't a tingy, anti-Semitic...
5066140	5067140	Well, a little bit.
5067140	5068140	Maybe a little bit.
5069140	5070140	He's a cute dad.
5070140	5071140	He's a cute dad?
5071140	5072140	Neb.
5072140	5073140	Oh, yeah.
5073140	5074140	Neb.
5074140	5075140	Neb.
5075140	5076140	Like, Nebish?
5076140	5077140	He's sure for Nebulon.
5078140	5079140	Do you speak Yiddish?
5080140	5081140	Hebrew.
5081140	5082140	Hebrew.
5082140	5083140	Sorry.
5084140	5085140	Wait, what's the...
5085140	5086140	I'm sorry.
5086140	5087140	What's the difference between Yiddish and Hebrew?
5087140	5088140	Different dialects, man.
5089140	5092140	So is Yiddish like an informal or what's the...
5092140	5094140	Steve, you want to field this one?
5094140	5097140	Yiddish was like Eastern European...
5098140	5099140	It's Hebrew and German.
5100140	5101140	Oh, okay.
5101140	5103140	Because I have relatives that speak a little...
5103140	5108140	My great-grandparents, they're from the Polish corridor part of Europe
5108140	5113140	and there's a lot of Yiddish-isms.
5113140	5115140	I would get my duper washed.
5115140	5117140	The bathtub duper means...
5117140	5118140	No, wait, that's Polish.
5118140	5119140	That's for butt.
5121140	5123140	Your family washed your butt.
5123140	5124140	I like those duper washings.
5125140	5127140	Madam, out there, I think we can agree that Steve...
5127140	5128140	Does Steve have a ponem?
5128140	5129140	What a ponem?
5130140	5131140	What a ponem?
5131140	5132140	A what?
5132140	5133140	A ponem?
5133140	5134140	He's got a ponem.
5134140	5135140	And I hear he's a menge.
5135140	5136140	A shaina ponem?
5136140	5137140	He's got a shaina ponem.
5138140	5139140	Unga Chachka.
5142140	5143140	Did I say something?
5145140	5147140	Yes, I think you called me a knick-knack.
5147140	5148140	Huh?
5152140	5154140	We'll play some D&D, shall we, before the time runs out?
5154140	5155140	I don't know.
5158140	5159140	Maybe we'll set...
5159140	5161140	I think we've had enough of this michigos.
5163140	5165140	We'll set aside a segment for next week.
5165140	5166140	We'll just...
5167140	5169140	As someone on Twitter suggested, take it or leave it.
5171140	5172140	We'll get to know, leave you alone.
5172140	5173140	Or we just have leavey dating game.
5173140	5176140	We just bring up all the women that are in love with him
5176140	5177140	and just bring them up on stage.
5177140	5178140	This'll be great.
5178140	5179140	Steve won't even be here.
5179140	5180140	It'll be great.
5183140	5184140	He doesn't need any help there.
5184140	5186140	And I'm not going to whore him out.
5186140	5187140	I'm not going to...
5188140	5190140	I just want to make him uncomfortable because it's adorable.
5192140	5195140	We went to New York and every woman we met just fell in love with him.
5195140	5196140	That's what I'm saying.
5196140	5197140	Yeah.
5197140	5198140	That's not true.
5198140	5199140	No, that's true.
5199140	5200140	You can't see it.
5201140	5203140	We try to help, don't get us wrong.
5203140	5204140	Okay.
5207140	5208140	It's just...
5208140	5209140	It's something you don't see.
5209140	5210140	That's great.
5210140	5211140	Alright.
5211140	5212140	Let's parry your charm.
5212140	5213140	That's great.
5214140	5215140	Spencer, you got to squeeze lately?
5215140	5217140	Any action in the dating realm?
5218140	5220140	I've squeezed a few, but...
5223140	5225140	No one's happy about it.
5226140	5228140	There's no squeaking happening.
5228140	5229140	Yeah!
5235140	5236140	Nobody won?
5237140	5238140	No.
5238140	5239140	No.
5239140	5240140	Alright.
5240140	5243140	Spencer, if you don't mind, let's get us off...
5243140	5246140	Last we left, some weird shit was going down.
5246140	5248140	So hit us to the jive, if you will.
5249140	5252140	When last we left, some weird shit was going on.
5253140	5254140	What happened?
5254140	5259140	You guys had infiltrated the church with partially the help of Patchens.
5259140	5262140	You conspired in the courtyard on what to do next,
5262140	5266140	and you decided what to do next was to go to the library.
5266140	5269140	Once in the library, you read a couple of the books,
5269140	5273140	and then went up some stairs, and one of the stairs had marbles in it,
5273140	5277140	and Chad grabbed the marble, one of the marbles,
5277140	5279140	and then Carlos grabbed the rest of the marbles,
5279140	5282140	and you went up the stairs, and nothing was theirs.
5283140	5286140	You went down and found a secret door.
5286140	5289140	Carlos found a secret door, and he opened it,
5289140	5292140	but there was a trap, and they took damage,
5292140	5295140	and I hope it's written down on your character sheets.
5297140	5299140	And then they went down into the secret dungeon,
5299140	5302140	where they saw an unholy sight.
5302140	5306140	A rogue figure manipulating a magical object,
5306140	5311140	and melting flesh together into unhinged monstrosities.
5311140	5314140	Oh boy, who knows what would happen next.
5314140	5317140	Find out now.
5328140	5332140	Do they see us? Do they notice our presence in the doorway here?
5332140	5336140	Are they too busy making sexy blood magic go on?
5336140	5337140	That's a good question.
5337140	5340140	So let's pretend we're going back in time.
5340140	5342140	How do you guys go down this ladder?
5342140	5345140	Because that would determine the answer to that question.
5345140	5348140	Well, I usually sing my ladder song.
5348140	5355140	Ladders go up, but mine goes down.
5355140	5361140	I love a rung or two when you ring me a frown.
5361140	5363140	No, we're trying to be stealthy, I think.
5363140	5366140	Right, but which order?
5367140	5370140	I should go down first, and put my shield,
5370140	5373140	and use my shield so you guys can come behind me,
5373140	5376140	and I can defend you, just in case.
5376140	5378140	Wait, explain that more.
5378140	5380140	You're on a ladder, and you're using your shield too.
5380140	5383140	I'm going to like, Ghostbusters down the ladder,
5383140	5386140	and then whip out my shield, and then you guys fall behind me,
5386140	5388140	and then any sort of projector.
5388140	5389140	Are you sliding down the...
5389140	5392140	I'm sliding, and I'm going to do a quick move with my shield.
5392140	5393140	Whoa.
5393140	5397140	This is very action-hero-y, you know?
5397140	5402140	Is this the original Ghostbusters?
5402140	5405140	The first movie, Ghostbusters.
5405140	5406140	Okay.
5406140	5407140	All right.
5407140	5409140	Well, I assume... I don't know.
5409140	5413140	I've seen that movie, but I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
5413140	5415140	They have a fire pole.
5415140	5417140	They go down a fire pole.
5417140	5418140	Right.
5418140	5421140	I come down like the new women's Ghostbusters,
5421140	5424140	and I go, oh, this looks like a room full of nightmares.
5424140	5425140	It is.
5425140	5426140	Yeah.
5426140	5427140	All right.
5427140	5429140	Well, you Ghostbusters down.
5429140	5432140	Steve's in the lead with the shield leading,
5432140	5435140	and the rest of you are behind him, so that's kind of the situation.
5435140	5436140	All right.
5436140	5438140	In that, it sounds like they do know you're here.
5438140	5439140	Uh-oh.
5439140	5441140	How many people are in the room?
5441140	5444140	You see six people... No, seven people.
5444140	5448140	Six of the people got all warped by flesh.
5448140	5450140	They're like bathing in flesh,
5450140	5453140	and it was mutating them into horrid monstrosities,
5453140	5456140	like getting long arms and weird legs and stuff.
5456140	5458140	Their chins are melting,
5458140	5462140	and they're getting, like, an eyeball on a stick.
5462140	5464140	It's gross.
5464140	5467140	But that rogue figure is the one that we found in the pumpkin patch
5467140	5470140	where we were trying to beat cow people, and he flew off, right?
5470140	5473140	Yeah, you can tell by the robe.
5473140	5474140	Oh, really?
5474140	5475140	Yeah.
5475140	5476140	Oh, that's cool.
5476140	5477140	It's the same one.
5477140	5479140	That plan kind of worked, then.
5479140	5480140	It worked enough.
5480140	5482140	All right, guys, uh...
5482140	5484140	How far away are we from them?
5484140	5486140	Uh...
5486140	5487140	Sorry.
5487140	5488140	Oh, boy.
5488140	5489140	Do we got a map of this?
5489140	5490140	30 feet.
5490140	5491140	Do we got a map of this room, or no?
5491140	5492140	I don't have a map.
5492140	5496140	A lot of the rooms are rectangular, and this is no exception.
5499140	5500140	All right.
5500140	5501140	So, you're in the corner...
5501140	5504140	The ladder comes down the corner.
5504140	5507140	There's kind of barrels stacked up along the walls,
5507140	5508140	and there's one cabinet.
5508140	5511140	On the far end of the longish room,
5511140	5515140	you see the table that all that melted flesh was on,
5515140	5517140	and there's also, like, an altar.
5517140	5520140	It looks like an altar to an evil entity.
5520140	5522140	And there's also a little well, like, uh...
5522140	5525140	Yeah, like a well for drawing water.
5525140	5528140	You're saying this to all of us because we've all...
5528140	5530140	You're figuring we've all come down the ladder.
5530140	5532140	That's my assumption, currently.
5532140	5533140	Okay.
5533140	5534140	I'm willing to go with that.
5534140	5535140	We came down the ladder.
5535140	5537140	Yeah, whatever you guys want.
5539140	5541140	Okay, so they know we're there.
5541140	5542140	The jig is up, right?
5542140	5543140	Oh, it is.
5543140	5544140	Okay.
5544140	5545140	Uh, guys?
5545140	5547140	Battle formations!
5549140	5552140	Gentlemen, be you man or beast.
5552140	5555140	You still be of the Church of the Silver Flame.
5555140	5557140	Lay down your aggressions.
5557140	5559140	Recant.
5559140	5560140	You'll be shown mercy.
5560140	5561140	All right.
5561140	5563140	The rogue figure picks up a barrel.
5563140	5567140	It's like a, you know, a big size barrel and throws it at you.
5568140	5569140	She's faster than you.
5569140	5570140	Oh, man.
5570140	5572140	All right, well, did you say she?
5572140	5573140	What?
5573140	5574140	Did you say she?
5574140	5575140	Oh, nope.
5575140	5576140	Yeah.
5576140	5577140	Yeah.
5577140	5579140	Well, it hits you in the face, Steve.
5579140	5580140	What?
5580140	5581140	I have my shield out.
5581140	5583140	It hits you right in the shield.
5583140	5586140	Yeah, because you, you, you, you gender, uh...
5586140	5587140	Fluid.
5587140	5588140	Assigned her.
5588140	5589140	No, I did that.
5589140	5590140	All right.
5590140	5591140	You take seven damage.
5591140	5592140	Holy shit.
5592140	5594140	You should have taken the eggshell pill.
5594140	5595140	Can you guys...
5595140	5596140	Can you guys heal me?
5596140	5601140	The barrel explodes, spraying urine everywhere, oh boy.
5601140	5602140	What?
5603140	5605140	She threw a pee barrel at you?
5605140	5606140	Oh, it was a barrel.
5606140	5607140	Yeah, so it was a pee barrel.
5607140	5609140	Why are they peeing in barrels?
5609140	5610140	It's the olden days.
5610140	5612140	People peed in barrels back then.
5613140	5614140	Where do you want them to go?
5614140	5616140	The first city national bank building?
5617140	5619140	Why are they saving the pee?
5620140	5622140	It's for doing laundry.
5623140	5626140	I take that gold marble that I found in the trap
5626140	5629140	that has kind of sloshies, maybe possibly liquid in it,
5629140	5630140	and I don't know what it is,
5630140	5632140	but I think it's probably a weapon,
5632140	5634140	and I throw it at the robed figure.
5634140	5635140	All right.
5635140	5637140	What's your, uh...
5637140	5639140	What's your ranged...
5639140	5641140	Do you have a ranged attack?
5642140	5643140	Like with my bow, you mean?
5643140	5646140	Yeah, just give me your bow base attack bonus.
5646140	5647140	Well, that's 100 feet with the bow.
5647140	5649140	Nah, just the base attack bonus.
5649140	5650140	Sorry.
5650140	5651140	I'm sorry, base attack bonus.
5651140	5652140	Where are you?
5653140	5654140	It's on the left.
5654140	5655140	Oh, uh, one.
5655140	5656140	Yeah.
5657140	5658140	Oh, boy.
5658140	5661140	You throw the marble, and it lands on the floor.
5661140	5666140	It explodes, and it emits a shrill ringing sound.
5666140	5670140	It's like, ring, the hooded figure recoils
5670140	5672140	with a terrible scream,
5672140	5675140	as if they're hypersensitive to sounds,
5675140	5677140	but they don't seem to take any damage or anything.
5677140	5678140	Oh, wait, wait.
5678140	5679140	Yeah.
5679140	5684140	I start hitting my steel shield with my elvish blade.
5684140	5685140	All right.
5685140	5686140	You do that.
5686140	5687140	It's making noise.
5687140	5688140	Oh, boy.
5691140	5693140	They don't seem happy.
5695140	5697140	Carlos, can you heal me?
5698140	5699140	Sure.
5701140	5703140	Well, I mean, normally...
5704140	5708140	You can substitute any level one spell for a healing spell.
5708140	5709140	All right.
5709140	5710140	Okay.
5710140	5711140	Well...
5711140	5712140	That's a spontaneous casting.
5712140	5713140	All right.
5713140	5718140	Well, I substitute divine favor off of my offensive loadout
5718140	5720140	for a healing spell.
5722140	5723140	I don't seem very happy about it.
5723140	5724140	I have a...
5724140	5725140	Well, no.
5725140	5727140	Well, of course I'm not happy about it.
5727140	5728140	You don't have to heal me.
5728140	5730140	No one wants to give up divine favor.
5731140	5733140	That never sounds like a good idea,
5733140	5735140	but friendship is friendship.
5735140	5736140	Oh, man.
5736140	5739140	You heal him for 10 damage.
5739140	5740140	Wow.
5740140	5741140	Thank you.
5741140	5743140	So I think you're back to full health,
5743140	5745140	even if you took the trap damage.
5745140	5746140	I'll get that later.
5746140	5747140	Oh, really?
5747140	5748140	Yeah.
5748140	5753140	So then all the shambling mounds start shambling towards you.
5753140	5757140	It seems that all this mutating didn't make them faster.
5757140	5762140	So they're kind of like a wall of disgusting flesh.
5762140	5763140	It's horrendous.
5763140	5764140	How many of them?
5764140	5765140	There's six of them.
5765140	5768140	They're kind of forming a wall between you
5768140	5770140	and the hooded figure.
5770140	5774140	So it's just of the original people
5774140	5777140	in this Roman Polanski scene that we walked into,
5777140	5779140	there's just the hooded figure,
5779140	5782140	and now everyone else has turned into these shambling flesh people?
5782140	5783140	Yeah.
5783140	5784140	Okay.
5784140	5785140	There's three of them.
5785140	5786140	Six of them.
5787140	5788140	Nice try.
5790140	5793140	I summon nature's ally.
5793140	5794140	All right.
5794140	5795140	Which nature's ally?
5795140	5796140	You can just stay and take a shit.
5796140	5797140	We're friends.
5804140	5807140	I summon a serpent.
5807140	5808140	All right.
5808140	5809140	What kind of serpent?
5809140	5811140	Like a big-ass cobra.
5812140	5817140	Like a mutant-loving cobra chomper.
5817140	5818140	All right.
5818140	5820140	You summon a big-ass cobra.
5820140	5822140	I drop the kids off at the pool.
5823140	5825140	What do you want the cobra to do?
5825140	5831140	I want them to attack the boogens that are coming at us.
5832140	5834140	It attacks the boogens.
5836140	5837140	Sorry.
5837140	5838140	Hold up.
5838140	5839140	Oh, boy.
5840140	5846140	While Spencer's consulting the literature to see how that attack fared,
5846140	5852140	it's a good time to wonder whether you should have meal ingredients delivered to your home in a box.
5855140	5858140	Do you hate eating prepared meals?
5859140	5860140	Yes.
5860140	5865140	Do you want to make your own but you don't want to go to the grocery store?
5866140	5870140	Well, then the world is dying.
5870140	5872140	What's the name of this company?
5873140	5875140	Fresh Hello Box.
5876140	5878140	Fresh Hello Box.
5878140	5884140	Fresh Hello Box brings you five boxes a day full of gourmet ingredients from only the freshest people.
5884140	5885140	All right.
5885140	5886140	So I got a cobra.
5886140	5888140	I have a magic cobra in the room right now.
5888140	5891140	You guys know what I hate is liquid cologne.
5891140	5893140	It's just not solid enough for me.
5893140	5895140	I don't like other people's undies.
5895140	5897140	What happened to me undies?
5899140	5902140	I don't want to keep walking around in there undies.
5903140	5904140	All right.
5904140	5909140	The cobra, it wraps around one of the legs of one of these shambling horror things
5909140	5914140	and bites its jaws sink into the flesh of the leg.
5914140	5917140	And oh, man, it hurts the thing.
5917140	5921140	It cries out in a horrific garbled cry.
5921140	5922140	Oh, man.
5922140	5923140	It goes down.
5923140	5927140	He's like he's wracked in pain from the what do you call it?
5927140	5928140	Poison.
5929140	5931140	Yeah, Ben, that's the word.
5932140	5934140	Yeah, that's guys.
5934140	5937140	That's called my little cobra friend.
5938140	5942140	Does he keep moving around and kicking butt or is he kind of dealing with that boogum for a while?
5942140	5944140	That guy is dealing with it right now.
5944140	5945140	He's like tussling with it.
5945140	5946140	Okay.
5946140	5947140	Okay.
5947140	5950140	So the hooded figure crosses over and attacks at what do you call it?
5950140	5951140	Chad.
5952140	5953140	That's me.
5953140	5954140	Yeah.
5954140	5957140	Now, now she's like real fast and she like blasts over to you.
5957140	5958140	What's your AC?
5959140	5963140	It is 17.
5966140	5967140	Yeah, 17.
5967140	5968140	17.
5968140	5969140	All right.
5969140	5970140	You take three damage.
5970140	5976140	She punches you with the strength of something real strong, like inhumanly strong.
5976140	5977140	Oh, boy.
5977140	5979140	It hurts, but only three damage.
5979140	5980140	So it doesn't hurt that much.
5980140	5981140	All right.
5981140	5983140	So Steve's turn.
5983140	5989140	If she was affected by the clanging sound of your shield, she's not really showing it.
5989140	5990140	Okay.
5990140	5991140	How far is she for me?
5991140	5998140	She's within 10 feet of you because she's like mixing it up with Jeff who's close to you or behind you potentially.
5998140	6002140	Do I have to go through the monster people to get to her?
6002140	6003140	No.
6003140	6006140	Can I do a full attack on her?
6007140	6008140	Yeah.
6009140	6012140	How many attacks do you get on a full attack?
6012140	6014140	How many do I get?
6014140	6015140	Yeah.
6015140	6016140	Where would it say that?
6016140	6017140	Probably just one.
6019140	6020140	They wouldn't say that.
6020140	6021140	Oh, okay.
6021140	6022140	I'll just assume it's one.
6022140	6024140	They can't be not one.
6024140	6025140	Sorry, everybody.
6025140	6028140	It says plus four plus four attack bonus.
6028140	6030140	Oh, you do get two.
6030140	6031140	What do you know?
6031140	6032140	All right.
6032140	6034140	You hit her with your sword.
6034140	6035140	No.
6035140	6036140	Do you have a sword?
6036140	6045140	I use my Elvish blade and do some kind of cool Legolas attack with my bow.
6047140	6048140	Yeah.
6049140	6050140	Is that doable?
6050140	6051140	Wait.
6051140	6052140	You said your bow?
6052140	6054140	I have two attacks, right?
6054140	6055140	Yeah.
6055140	6057140	So you're going to use your sword first and then do a bow attack?
6057140	6058140	Yeah.
6058140	6059140	Is that cool?
6059140	6065140	Well, it's not going to be like you have a penalty to bow attacks within a close range.
6065140	6066140	Oh, I didn't know that.
6066140	6067140	Yeah.
6067140	6068140	All right.
6068140	6070140	I'll use my Elvish blade twice.
6070140	6071140	Yeah.
6071140	6072140	Oh boy.
6072140	6075140	One will be cooler than the next.
6075140	6077140	One is cooler than the next.
6077140	6081140	The first hit misses and the second hit hits.
6082140	6085140	Good thing I had two tries.
6086140	6092140	You slash into the hooded figure's face, revealing her face.
6092140	6093140	It's pale.
6093140	6094140	Yeah.
6094140	6095140	This is pale.
6095140	6097140	She's got long stringy black hair.
6097140	6100140	It's like gross, gross black hair.
6100140	6101140	Oh boy.
6101140	6102140	She's pale.
6102140	6104140	Is it a person?
6104140	6105140	It looks, yeah.
6105140	6107140	It's like a human-looking person.
6107140	6108140	Yeah.
6108140	6109140	You slice her in the face.
6109140	6110140	Does she shake it out?
6110140	6115140	Like now, like it's at that moment in the 80s movie where it's like it's a woman and
6115140	6117140	she shakes her hair.
6117140	6120140	No, she starts to, but she was doing something else.
6120140	6121140	And we already knew she was a woman.
6121140	6123140	How much damage does she take?
6123140	6126140	She takes 17 damage to the hood.
6127140	6128140	All right.
6128140	6130140	You score a deep blow.
6130140	6132140	It goes deep into her face.
6132140	6133140	Oh man.
6133140	6134140	Is she bleeding?
6134140	6135140	She's bleeding.
6135140	6136140	Is it human blood?
6136140	6137140	You stabbed her in the face?
6137140	6139140	She sliced her in the face.
6139140	6140140	What?
6140140	6141140	Is it like human red blood?
6141140	6142140	Yeah.
6142140	6143140	It's human red blood.
6143140	6144140	Oh, okay.
6144140	6147140	But then her wounds start healing together.
6147140	6150140	And like it goes, like it sucks together.
6150140	6152140	You know, it's starting to heal fast style.
6152140	6157140	It doesn't heal completely or anything, but it's starting to heal up inhumanly.
6159140	6161140	That's where I come in, right?
6161140	6162140	Yeah.
6162140	6163140	Isn't it my turn?
6163140	6164140	Yeah.
6164140	6165140	Yeah, it is.
6165140	6166140	Nowhere to hide.
6166140	6167140	Nowhere to run.
6167140	6168140	Summon monster.
6168140	6169140	One.
6169140	6170140	All right.
6170140	6171140	What monster?
6171140	6172140	Level one.
6172140	6175140	Don't tell her what level one is.
6175140	6176140	Yeah, right.
6176140	6177140	You're right.
6177140	6179140	I don't know why I made that part of my incantation.
6180140	6183140	Make it sound like a high level monster.
6183140	6186140	Summon monster market price.
6188140	6189140	You don't know.
6191140	6192140	What do you want to summon?
6192140	6194140	If you have to ask, you can't afford it.
6194140	6196140	Oh, the lobster thermador you want.
6197140	6199140	What are you trying to summon, man?
6199140	6200140	Well, I'm sorry.
6200140	6202140	I had to ask you this, but I don't know my choices.
6202140	6207140	There's a dire rat, a dog, a dolphin, eagle, fire beetle, poison frog, pony.
6207140	6209140	I got distracted when you said dolphin.
6209140	6211140	I didn't hear anything else.
6211140	6213140	I heard dire rat because it sounds like diarrhea.
6213140	6214140	I got distracted by that.
6214140	6216140	Just go from the top.
6216140	6217140	Dire rat.
6217140	6218140	Dire rat.
6218140	6219140	Dog.
6219140	6220140	Dolphin.
6220140	6221140	Eagle.
6221140	6222140	Fire beetle.
6222140	6223140	Eagle.
6223140	6224140	Eagle.
6224140	6225140	Eagle.
6225140	6226140	Eagle.
6226140	6227140	I'm sorry.
6227140	6228140	Fire beetle.
6228140	6229140	Fire beetle.
6229140	6230140	Fire beetle.
6230140	6231140	Frog.
6231140	6232140	Frog.
6232140	6233140	Poison frog.
6233140	6234140	It's a poison frog.
6234140	6235140	It's a choice between frog and poison frog.
6235140	6236140	No, no, no.
6236140	6237140	Don't pick the frog.
6237140	6238140	Don't pick the frog.
6238140	6240140	Don't pick the regular frog.
6240140	6245140	I hope he settles near me.
6245140	6252140	I believe that dire rat is going to be the perfect, like, I'm like, yeah.
6252140	6254140	We're in a legit dungeon.
6254140	6255140	Yeah.
6255140	6256140	You got to bring the rat out.
6256140	6258140	We got a snake and a rat.
6258140	6261140	It's like the Chinese calendar.
6261140	6262140	All right.
6262140	6263140	You summon a dire rat.
6263140	6265140	What are you doing with it?
6265140	6268140	Attack the robed woman.
6268140	6269140	All right.
6269140	6274140	You summon a filthy rat the size of a small dog.
6274140	6280140	That's my commanding him.
6280140	6282140	Who are you attacking again?
6282140	6283140	The lady.
6283140	6284140	Oh, man.
6284140	6286140	It lunges at her, but it misses.
6286140	6290140	It jumps straight past her into a wall.
6290140	6294140	I should have, I should have sicked it at one of the poison frog.
6294140	6298140	No, I should have sicked it at one of the shambling mounds.
6298140	6299140	Yeah.
6299140	6301140	That poison frog, though.
6301140	6302140	Oh, boy.
6302140	6305140	The shambling mounds, they continue to advance.
6305140	6311140	They get towards you and start lashing out with their grubby, gross flesh hands.
6311140	6314140	Six of them.
6314140	6318140	We're fucked.
6318140	6322140	Yeah.
6322140	6325140	I don't like the sound of that.
6325140	6326140	All right.
6326140	6329140	Jeff, you take just five damage.
6329140	6336140	Steve takes two damage, and Dan takes six damage.
6336140	6340140	Are my HP on my sheet, like, updated from last time?
6340140	6341140	They should be.
6341140	6342140	Okay.
6342140	6343140	All right.
6343140	6345140	You said earlier you hoped we'd marked it down.
6345140	6347140	I'm down to six HP right now.
6347140	6350140	Oh, boy.
6350140	6353140	Whose turn is it?
6353140	6357140	It's a, it's not, it's a...
6357140	6358140	Shambling mounds turn?
6358140	6361140	No, it's the rogue figure's turn.
6361140	6362140	All right.
6362140	6365140	Should we run?
6365140	6367140	We're not running from shit.
6367140	6373140	We got a corporate, we got your weak ass fucking rat.
6373140	6379140	We could make a fast getaway on those horses.
6379140	6381140	I won't turn away from a fight, though.
6381140	6382140	Let's keep going.
6382140	6383140	Yeah.
6383140	6386140	The vampire turns into mist.
6386140	6387140	The vampire?
6387140	6390140	Oh, yeah, it's a vampire.
6390140	6393140	Spoiler alert.
6393140	6396140	Yeah, pale humanoid is kind of vampire, right?
6396140	6397140	Okay.
6397140	6398140	Especially if they're healing.
6398140	6401140	I mean, yeah, I could have done a better job.
6401140	6403140	I'm not going to deny that.
6403140	6404140	It's a vampire.
6404140	6407140	Well, now it's a mist.
6408140	6410140	It's not clear what this portends.
6410140	6411140	All right.
6411140	6412140	It's Jeff's turn.
6412140	6414140	So that vampire just boned out.
6414140	6415140	Well, it's a mist.
6415140	6416140	It's a mist.
6416140	6418140	Is it still misting around the room?
6418140	6420140	At the moment, it hasn't really picked a direction.
6420140	6424140	Did it do it because it doesn't want to get eaten by a rat?
6424140	6426140	It's not clear what this portends.
6426140	6429140	All right, well, I...
6429140	6433140	Is it mist kind of all in one kind of space?
6433140	6435140	No, it's kind of like the room's a bit foggy.
6435140	6437140	It's not quite that compact.
6437140	6438140	All right.
6438140	6441140	Now, are these shambling motherfuckers,
6441140	6443140	are they all in a group or are they kind of like...
6443140	6447140	Yeah, they've all converged kind of around towards you.
6447140	6448140	All right.
6448140	6449140	Fire domain.
6449140	6450140	Firebolt!
6450140	6454140	And I shoot and I try to go zap and like zoom.
6454140	6458140	Like Pickle Rick laser in the fucking...
6458140	6459140	Against...
6459140	6460140	What was his name?
6460140	6461140	Condor?
6461140	6462140	Jack where?
6462140	6463140	Jack where?
6463140	6466140	Yeah, I try to go wah, cross with these motherfuckers.
6466140	6467140	All right.
6467140	6468140	One of them catches on fire.
6468140	6469140	Oh boy.
6469140	6472140	He takes six fire damage and catches fire.
6472140	6475140	And he's screaming this gurgly scream
6475140	6478140	that sounds like he's got a melted uvula.
6478140	6481140	And he starts running around and he's like
6481140	6484140	catching things on fire, catching barrels on fire.
6484140	6488140	Uh oh, he's making pea barrels catch fire.
6488140	6491140	You know how flammable pea can be.
6492140	6493140	Is pea actually flammable?
6493140	6495140	No, no.
6495140	6496140	I don't think so at least.
6496140	6498140	Mine frequently is.
6498140	6499140	Oh shit.
6499140	6503140	How would any organism survive Darwin's gauntlet
6503140	6505140	with flammable pea?
6508140	6510140	I wasn't thinking about it.
6510140	6511140	All right, so we got one.
6511140	6513140	We got one that's been subdued by my snake.
6513140	6514140	By the viper, yeah.
6514140	6516140	Oh yeah, the snake should have a turn too.
6516140	6517140	Oh yeah.
6517140	6519140	Does he still want to keep tussling?
6519140	6521140	Is it a snake?
6521140	6522140	It's a cobra.
6522140	6523140	A cobra, yeah.
6523140	6526140	Cobras always want to fuck another chance.
6526140	6527140	Is that the case?
6527140	6528140	Yes.
6528140	6529140	Okay.
6529140	6530140	All right.
6530140	6532140	He bites him again.
6532140	6535140	Oh, this time he bites him right in the eye.
6535140	6536140	Okay.
6536140	6537140	All right.
6537140	6538140	That's on your dice?
6538140	6541140	Yeah, it was a snake eyes.
6543140	6544140	Yay.
6544140	6546140	That's our show.
6546140	6547140	No.
6550140	6554140	He bites him in the eye and now he's like screaming real loud
6554140	6556140	as if the poison's in his brain.
6556140	6557140	Yeah.
6557140	6558140	All right.
6558140	6560140	Just a shambling mound you're talking about.
6560140	6562140	It's like he was a person.
6562140	6563140	He's like a mutant person.
6563140	6566140	It's like if a person turned into an action figure and melted.
6566140	6567140	Yeah.
6567140	6569140	So I got one dude on fire.
6569140	6572140	This other guy's going crazy on snake eye poison.
6572140	6573140	Yeah.
6573140	6574140	All right.
6574140	6575140	All right.
6575140	6576140	Steve.
6577140	6578140	All right.
6578140	6580140	Have we eliminated any of those?
6580140	6583140	I'd say two seem to be out of the immediate fight.
6583140	6584140	Okay.
6586140	6591140	I'll attack the closest one with my elvish blade.
6593140	6594140	All right.
6594140	6596140	You get you miss once and then it's a critical hit.
6596140	6598140	Oh, boy.
6599140	6601140	Dealing damage.
6603140	6605140	Dealing 14 damage.
6605140	6607140	That was less than that normal hit.
6607140	6608140	Okay.
6608140	6610140	Well, that's numbers.
6610140	6611140	All right.
6611140	6617140	You lop off the stretchy elongated head of one of the mutated forms.
6618140	6619140	Oh, boy.
6619140	6620140	Yeah.
6620140	6623140	It's pain, baby.
6623140	6624140	All right.
6624140	6625140	Nice job, DJ.
6625140	6626140	Thanks.
6629140	6630140	It's harming.
6630140	6633140	I am using channel smite.
6633140	6634140	It's one of my feats.
6634140	6635140	Yeah.
6635140	6637140	Which won't fail me now.
6638140	6643140	To deal extra damage to undead on attack.
6643140	6648140	Now, I'm making the snap judgment in my head that these shambling mound things are not undead.
6650140	6651140	And I got a nod.
6651140	6654140	So I'm attacking the mist.
6655140	6657140	I didn't think this through.
6658140	6661140	If you have a towel, do you think that could help?
6662140	6663140	I don't know.
6663140	6665140	Somebody who absorbed the mist.
6667140	6668140	Towels.
6668140	6670140	Mists one great weakness.
6676140	6678140	The shambling mounds aren't undead.
6680140	6682140	I know that as a cleric.
6682140	6683140	Yeah.
6683140	6684140	You know that as a cleric.
6684140	6685140	They're like mutants.
6685140	6686140	They're like demonic.
6686140	6687140	They're not.
6687140	6688140	Yeah.
6688140	6689140	All right.
6689140	6690140	Well, then...
6690140	6691140	But they are evil.
6693140	6694140	God damn it.
6694140	6695140	I just...
6695140	6697140	I got this mist.
6697140	6699140	I gotta get this fucker.
6701140	6703140	I can't hit her with a...
6703140	6704140	I'll just hit a shambling mound.
6704140	6705140	I'm not channeling smite.
6705140	6706140	I'm not doing that.
6706140	6707140	I lied.
6707140	6708140	Okay.
6708140	6713140	I'm hitting a shambling mound with my morning star.
6713140	6714140	All right.
6714140	6715140	What's your attack bonus?
6715140	6716140	And damage?
6716140	6717140	Plus two.
6717140	6718140	Oh, wow.
6718140	6719140	Times two if it's critical.
6719140	6720140	All right.
6720140	6721140	Well, you hit.
6721140	6722140	That damage is 1d8, right?
6722140	6723140	Yeah.
6723140	6724140	Plus one.
6724140	6725140	Mind you.
6727140	6728140	All right.
6728140	6730140	You smash one in his head.
6731140	6734140	You explode his giant ear and it oozes pus
6734140	6738140	as his brain also pushes out of his ear.
6739140	6740140	He dies.
6741140	6742140	Yeah!
6746140	6747140	All right.
6747140	6748140	It's 959 right now.
6748140	6749140	So we got...
6749140	6751140	How many standing boogans have we got?
6751140	6752140	Two.
6752140	6753140	Two boogans?
6753140	6754140	Yeah.
6754140	6755140	And we still got a frog and a...
6755140	6756140	As the frog...
6756140	6757140	Not a frog.
6757140	6758140	We got a rat.
6758140	6759140	Has the rat gone again?
6759140	6760140	Oh, yeah.
6760140	6762140	Make the rat do something, Harmon.
6762140	6763140	Oh, rat.
6763140	6765140	Attack one of the shambling mounds.
6765140	6767140	Rats don't attack mist.
6771140	6772140	Sorry.
6772140	6773140	Oh, man.
6773140	6774140	Yeah.
6774140	6776140	It bites one of the guys right in the neck.
6776140	6777140	Oh, boy.
6777140	6778140	It tears his neck open.
6778140	6781140	He's not dead, but he's really heavily injured.
6781140	6782140	Oh, man.
6782140	6783140	The mist.
6783140	6785140	It takes a turn.
6785140	6786140	It leaves.
6786140	6787140	It goes up out of the ladder.
6787140	6788140	Shit.
6790140	6792140	Follow that mist.
6793140	6794140	Come on, snake.
6794140	6795140	Come on, rat.
6795140	6796140	We're going up this ladder.
6796140	6797140	I put the snake around my neck like a...
6797140	6798140	Like a...
6798140	6799140	Like a scarf.
6799140	6800140	And then we're...
6800140	6801140	Like...
6801140	6802140	Let's go ahead.
6802140	6803140	Let's go get this goddamn mist.
6803140	6804140	All right.
6804140	6811140	The shambly guys, they reach after you with their fucked up limbs, but you manage to get
6811140	6812140	away unscathed.
6812140	6813140	Oh, my God.
6813140	6814140	Oh, my God.
6814140	6815140	Oh, my God.
6815140	6816140	Oh, my God.
6816140	6817140	Oh, my God.
6817140	6818140	Oh, my God.
6818140	6824500	You're fucked up limbs, but you manage to get away unscathed up the ladder.
6824500	6828180	The mist is nowhere to be found.
6828180	6832300	It was a mist.
6832300	6833300	We missed the mist.
6833300	6835820	We missed it.
6835820	6839340	It was a swing and a mist.
6839340	6842860	Should we go back down and just fuck up the other two guys just out of frustration?
6842860	6845260	There's a giant explosion from underground.
6845260	6846260	Oh, shit.
6846260	6847260	Oh, boy.
6847260	6850340	Man, everything down there explodes.
6850340	6854700	I guess the urn is flammable.
6854700	6858260	Do we survive it?
6858260	6859260	You guys do, yeah.
6859260	6861900	Oh, so down where we were below the ladder.
6861900	6862900	Yeah.
6862900	6866460	So there's just a big explosion ongoing or it just ends in the mist?
6866460	6867460	No, it happened.
6867460	6868460	Okay.
6868460	6869460	So then...
6869460	6871460	You were like, what the fuck?
6871460	6874020	Tyria, see down there if...
6874020	6875020	All right.
6875460	6877300	I go down into the...
6877300	6878900	I go down the ladder.
6878900	6879900	Oh, man.
6879900	6880900	It's just...
6880900	6882100	It's all blown up.
6882100	6883100	Can I see anything?
6883100	6884780	I have low light vision.
6884780	6892780	You can see a crumbling support pillar portending the collapse, imminent collapse.
6892780	6894380	Let's get the fuck out.
6894380	6896140	Well, he's just down there now.
6896140	6898940	Wait, so I have to get out of here.
6898940	6899940	Okay.
6899940	6900940	Okay.
6900940	6901940	I climb up the ladder quickly.
6901940	6902940	All right.
6902940	6903940	He's back with you guys.
6904500	6905900	What did you see down there?
6905900	6908140	An imminently collapsing pillar.
6908140	6910140	We got to get out of the structure.
6910140	6912140	Let's go out and get on those horses.
6912140	6914140	Let's get on the horses.
6914140	6915140	Oh, okay.
6915140	6921140	You've run into the courtyard and you can see the horses are slaughtered.
6921140	6922140	Oh, boy.
6922140	6923140	No!
6923140	6924140	We're back, everybody.
6924140	6925140	Steve Levy, everybody.
6925140	6936860	That's Diarilla Jr.
6936860	6945620	Let's give it up for our guest, Graham Linahan, everyone.
6945620	6949700	Also the birthday boy, Ian Ballas.
6949700	6950700	Is that right?
6950700	6951700	Welcome, Ian.
6951700	6952700	Thanks for coming.
6952700	6953700	Spencer Fittman.
6953700	6965780	Let's take church on photography, and Kevin, and Sarah, and Zach, and who else, Noah, and
6965780	6967580	all the people that make things happen here.
6967580	6968580	No way.
6968580	6994500	Here to come, total Jeff Davis is here for your mayor, Dan Harmon.
6994500	6997180	Did you get any of that?
6997180	7004380	It's a good show.
