0	17200	Hello and welcome to those downtowns in Hollywood, California, the Nerdist Theater,
17200	19200	to town and now obsession.
24200	27200	Do we have a Spencer Crittenden amongst us?
27200	29200	Here he is.
29200	31200	Spencer Crittenden!
41200	46200	And just to keep things rolling, let's bring out the mayor of downtown, Mr. Dan Harmon.
47200	58200	Hello and welcome to the Nerdist Theater, to town and now obsession.
77200	84200	I'm just waving to the people in the front row.
84200	88200	Dave Kline and Liara are wearing matching Schmatas right now.
88200	90200	Do you guys want to get up and show the crowd?
90200	93200	Are you in love? What's going on here?
93200	96200	Let's see, this is very nice.
96200	104200	Yeah, they both have kind of a Vincent van Gogh starry-starry night kind of thing happening.
104200	106200	Oh, you got presents?
106200	110200	She's reaching into her purse. This looks like some illicit action going on here.
110200	115200	This is a couple made of Harman Town regulars.
115200	118200	Can I ask, can I inquire, has this become a romance between you two?
118200	119200	Yeah.
119200	120200	Yeah?
120200	121200	All right.
121200	123200	Oh, shit.
123200	126200	Jeff, just to answer you, yup, yup.
126200	127200	Thank you.
127200	128200	Oh my God, that's so beautiful.
128200	130200	Did you guys just go to Disneyland?
130200	132200	She gave me a Mickey Mouse pin, which I lied to.
132200	135200	I love all things Disneyland.
135200	138200	Oh, look at you little lovebirds.
138200	140200	All right.
140200	141200	All right, sit down.
141200	142200	All right.
142200	145200	Well, Dave Kline, what were you going to say?
145200	146200	You had something to say.
146200	150200	I just wanted to give a shout out to Vinny Van Gogh,
150200	156200	and also a top-notch handkerchief fine art game they got up at the Getty Center.
156200	164200	You got great fine art prints on some top-notch silk scarfs.
165200	175200	Enter the code yup for a 20% discount.
175200	179200	He just becomes like this corrupt cottage industry.
179200	184200	Nike's coming out with the new yuppies.
184200	185200	We should do that.
185200	189200	Now that we're occasionally doing ads, we should have some of our Harmanians
189200	191200	get up and do some of our spots first.
191200	192200	Sure.
192200	197200	If you have $50,000, we'd be happy to plug your Etsy with the same vigor
197200	201200	as we do me undies.
201200	203200	Cody just texted me before I think of that,
203200	208200	but I was thinking because somebody, Casey, could be a girl's name or a Cody's.
208200	212200	Cody's, I think, tends to be a little more of a boy's name than a girl's name,
212200	215200	but Cody's excited if she were to have kids.
215200	218200	You know, whether it's a boy or a girl, it'll be Cody Jr.
218200	220200	It'd be cooler if it's a girl, a Cody Jr.
220200	222200	I think that'd be cool.
222200	226200	And then just now she texted me because we were just having such a nice time.
226200	229200	We're staying in a hotel because we got skunked,
229200	234200	and it turned into a really nice, what the kids call a staycation.
234200	240200	And by kids, I mean Jay Moore.
240200	242200	The Jay Moore generation.
242200	244200	I think they call it a staycation.
244200	246200	And it's been really nice.
246200	249200	We've been watching a lot of true crime stuff and murder stuff,
249200	251200	and she was just texting me,
251200	256200	what if we had a kid and another name could be Forensic?
256200	257200	That'd be a good name.
257200	258200	Forensic Heller?
258200	260200	Forensic Harmon.
260200	264200	Okay, so I just want to raise, we have a guest I'm pretty excited about.
264200	267200	I think it's going to be more fun to just hang out with and chat with.
267200	270200	Not that that excludes anybody else that's ever,
270200	273200	that they've all been fun to hang out and chat with.
273200	274200	Except that one guy.
274200	275200	Yeah, one guy.
275200	276200	That weird guy from Game of Thrones.
276200	278200	He was a real bummer.
278200	279200	Grey Worm?
279200	282200	Yeah, when he started rapping and fucking Valerian.
282200	287200	P.U. What a guest.
287200	289200	That's sarcasm of Grey Worms listening.
289200	291200	I'm being funny.
291200	293200	No.
293200	297200	That was pretty amazing.
297200	301200	I'm still excited that we had Grey Worm on the show.
301200	303200	I just want to do another segment,
303200	305200	even though it's going to be the same content,
305200	308200	but it's, again, just reminders to waitstaff.
308200	311200	Do we have a theme song for that segment?
311200	312200	Just, just...
312200	319200	Yeah, don't forget the stuff I told you
319200	323200	Not to do when you're serving me food
323200	325200	Just get the economy to laugh
325200	329200	Doesn't mean it's communism.
329200	331200	There's still a hierarchy.
331200	335200	Your money still has to trickle down from someone in the entertainment industry.
335200	338200	It's Los Angeles, not Detroit.
338200	340200	Stop saying, how's everything tasting?
340200	342200	Stop it.
342200	346200	Tasting is a word that evokes the idea of things in the mouth.
346200	349200	I don't want you talking about what's in my mouth.
349200	350200	I don't want you...
350200	352200	How's everything tasting?
352200	353200	How does everything taste?
353200	355200	Just say, how is everything?
355200	358200	Leave it at that, okay?
358200	359200	How's everything in your mouth?
359200	363200	How's your tongue running over your food right now?
363200	364200	Well...
364200	367200	Do you want that music sting in between each one of these,
367200	370200	or do you want to just keep it rolling?
370200	371200	Put a tag on that...
371200	372200	Let's try it out.
372200	373200	Like, so finish that first one.
373200	374200	There's only one more thing.
374200	375200	So then...
375200	384200	There's just one more thing that a waiter said to me.
384200	386200	Okay, so this kind of blew my mind,
386200	388200	because as you know, if you listen to the podcast,
388200	392200	you know that I don't enjoy it when you eat all your food
392200	395200	and it feels like it's held against you somehow
395200	398200	in some kind of strange, weird, like, power dynamic.
398200	401200	Like, I'm talking about the thing where they...
401200	404200	I guess you hated it when there's only crumbs on the plate.
404200	406200	And then you're like, I don't like it,
406200	408200	because it's them going like,
408200	412200	well, you either have to be a dick by not laughing,
412200	415200	or you have to, like, subjugate yourself by laughing.
415200	418200	I don't want to be put in that position.
418200	423200	You non-privileged people think you have problems.
423200	426200	As Molly Ringwald once said to Anthony Michael Hall,
426200	433200	it's hard being popular.
433200	437200	So this little fucking boner was pulled on me today.
437200	439200	I've never heard this one in my life.
439200	440200	Somebody pulled a boner?
440200	444200	Sometimes a wait person will say when they look at your empty plate...
444200	446200	I guess you hated it.
446200	451200	Leaving you to either go, I liked it.
451200	454200	Or for you to go, what? To do what?
454200	458200	And then they'll go like, come on, it can't be that bad.
458200	461200	I don't like being manipulated in a conversation.
461200	463200	It can just be exchange of information.
463200	468200	Like, I don't do that to you people. Right?
468200	471200	Thank you.
471200	474200	That was a good meta joke. I riffed that.
474200	476200	I lived it.
476200	479200	So this, I've never heard this before.
479200	483200	So I'm halfway done with the meal.
483200	486200	Cody and I are sitting at the... I won't name the place.
486200	487200	I don't want them to go out of business.
487200	490200	I don't want to Oprah their beef industry.
490200	491200	I know the power I have.
491200	493200	I'm going to let them chill for a little.
493200	496200	The manager will hear this. He'll clean up his act.
496200	500200	Just to keep it vague, it was one of Guy Fieri's restaurants.
501200	503200	So I'm halfway done with my meal.
503200	507200	And this person comes up, the wait person comes up and says,
507200	509200	I wrote it down.
509200	512200	Well, I... God damn it, fuck it.
512200	517200	No, I know it's the worst nightmare that I would point you out or mention you.
517200	521200	So I'm not going to. Welcome.
521200	525200	All right. So the wait person comes up and says,
525200	527200	Well, I guess I can assume everything's tasting good
527200	531200	because I can see that everything's half gone.
533200	539200	And I was like, well, my bro, I reserve the right to force myself to eat shitty food.
539200	542200	It's not like you can't assume. What do you mean?
542200	544200	I guess I can assume everything's tasting good.
544200	547200	First of all, you're using tasting. Let that slide.
547200	549200	I guess I can assume. What do you mean?
549200	552200	That's like when you say to somebody, I owe you an apology.
552200	556200	Well, give it up. And, Bob, give me my apology.
556200	559200	Don't tell me you owe it to me. That's like abuse.
559200	563200	Or even if you say, I apologize. No, you don't.
563200	566200	You describe yourself apologizing is what you do right now.
566200	570200	You're Tarzan saying, I apologize. You're not apologizing.
570200	574200	It's an acknowledgement of the offense, an expression of remorse,
574200	576200	and a commitment to change.
576200	579200	I learned it in therapy.
579200	581200	Four deep breaths. Four deep breaths.
581200	584200	You don't. Well, I guess I can assume everything's tasting good.
584200	588200	You can ask me if it's good. All right. Fine. That ends the segment.
588200	595200	Okay. All right.
595200	600200	And then there was an Uber driver playing country western music.
600200	608200	And by Uber driver, I guess I mean he was not the country western listener genetically.
608200	612200	Do you want some theme music for this segment here?
612200	621200	No, no. This is just Dan Harmon's attempt to weave the highway cones of white guilt and racism.
621200	626200	I felt like the guy was like, I don't know.
626200	633200	Look, he was an Uber driver. What country is that? I don't know.
633200	636200	But it's not the place where Travis Tritt is from.
636200	639200	It's called Uberkistan.
639200	644200	And I knew, you know, the same cologne in the Uber and the same general vibe,
644200	648200	but he's like playing the thing. And I was like, oh, it's Westwood.
648200	650200	That's why he's playing like this country station.
650200	656200	And I think it's maybe because I just made this racist assumption.
656200	658200	I was like, this can't be his favorite music.
658200	668200	Because it's like, let's raise a glass cheerleaders and quarterbacks
668200	671200	all through this small town heartland.
671200	676200	Those are actual lyrics, like kind of, not through all this, all through this small town heartland.
676200	683200	I made that up. But it was like, let's raise a glass to the cheerleaders and quarterbacks.
683200	691200	And he's driving and he's like, he's definitely like eastern, eastern, east of Eastern European.
691200	694200	And so he's never, I'm not saying.
694200	696200	He might be into today's modern country.
696200	701200	And we all want him to be, especially the people that ride, get an Uber in Westwood.
701200	706200	Tourists who are staying in Westwood and they're like, oh, you like Travis Trent?
706200	711200	Yes, I do. More stars for me.
711200	713200	But that's the thing I can't figure out. It's like, really?
713200	716200	Stars are that hard to get?
716200	718200	You could have tried to investigate and ask him.
718200	720200	No, I wouldn't. I would not.
720200	722200	You ever see this guy live?
722200	725200	Because if I had said, you like country western, he would have been like, you want me to change?
725200	728200	Well, I'll change it. I don't want to engage with you.
728200	732200	I want to listen to my last week's podcast.
732200	734200	On my earbuds. All right.
734200	738200	Look, I didn't come here to win popularity contests tonight.
738200	741200	You're speaking on last week's podcast and music.
741200	744200	You sang a little hair metal song about radio.
744200	746200	Oh, okay.
747200	749200	Oh, crap. Oh, here it is.
749200	751200	His name is... We found it on Twitter.
751200	756200	He gave it to me. His name is Nick Seepman, S-I-E-P-M-A-N-N.
756200	762200	And I forget his... I think his Twitter handle is saint underscore brickworks, if you want to find him.
762200	765200	Can I play what he wrote? It's only about two minutes long.
765200	767200	I think you guys might enjoy it.
767200	772200	Yeah, so if you're a hardcore enough fan that you've clicked on this,
772200	777200	then I guess you can use your little 15 circle button to fast forward through,
777200	779200	because you're playing the thing that you...
779200	782200	But if you bought a $10 ticket, fuck you.
782200	784200	But hopefully you haven't heard it.
784200	786200	No, but it's really good, because Dan just freesed out.
786200	788200	What was the setup to your song?
788200	790200	I was just singing Radiohead's name.
790200	797200	It sounds like the title of a very non-Radiohead band from, like, 86 or something.
797200	799200	Like, quite a hair band kind of thing.
799200	803200	And so, Nick here, titled his track Nightblade.
803200	806200	Sorry, the band is Nightblade. The track is Radiohead.
806200	808200	Shall I play it? Here we go.
808200	811200	And I haven't heard it. You described it to me in the green room.
811200	813200	Yeah, I listened to it in the car on the way home from the airport today.
813200	817200	And by the way, I just want to thank this guy in advance, because, as I was saying to you in the green room,
817200	821200	the truth is, I was high at Radiohead, and I really did start doing that thing,
821200	824200	and it was from a place of joy, and it was really much better than what I shared with you.
824200	827200	And I was like, turn your station to misery!
827200	831200	I was, like, trying to recapture something that was truly joyful, which every time I do, it always sucks.
831200	833200	But now this person is like a...
833200	837200	Yeah, like in true 80s rock and roll fashion, he's taken crappy lyrics and made it rock!
837200	839200	Here we go.
857200	860200	Yeah, get ready.
887200	889200	He's got a good chorus.
918200	921200	Do you want your station?
922200	925200	Protesting your lifelong?
926200	929200	It's all the time, it's all the time together.
930200	932200	It's all the time, it's all the time.
933200	936200	Gameplay, air guitar, the guitar solo.
947200	951200	And try to get it right out of radiohead.
952200	956200	It's a solo rock and roll.
957200	958200	Get out of radiohead.
959200	960200	Get out of radiohead.
960200	963200	It's all the time, it's all the time.
963200	967200	Get out of radiohead.
970200	974200	Get out of radiohead.
976200	978200	That's some good shit.
979200	982200	Yeah, I would have mixed the lyrics a little louder.
986200	989200	You're an ungrateful son of a bitch.
990200	992200	Spencer, what did you think about that?
992200	994200	It was amazing how Dave took his shirt off
994200	997200	when his guitar strap was still around his neck.
1000200	1002200	It was crazy.
1005200	1009200	Come to Harmon's town, we will note your space work.
1010200	1013200	No, I loved it. It was great.
1014200	1017200	If that's not worth subscribing to see Dave Klein take his shirt off
1017200	1020200	and defy guitar strap space work.
1021200	1025200	I'll save my Olympic questions for when our guest is out here.
1025200	1027200	They can be one of the things that I'm obsessed with.
1027200	1032200	Our next guest is kind of an armchair denotes amateur.
1032200	1035200	He's an expert. He doesn't have a PhD.
1035200	1038200	He's a comedian and a writer, but he's kind of an expert in obsession
1038200	1042200	because he's got a feral audio podcast about obsession.
1042200	1043200	Different people come on.
1043200	1045200	They talk about the things they're obsessed with
1045200	1047200	and he gets to the bottom of them.
1047200	1051200	He's also written amazing, super funny crazy shit
1051200	1054200	for our friend James Urbaniac who's been on the show.
1054200	1057200	Please welcome Joseph Skrimshaw.
1064200	1067200	I didn't realize until right before I was like,
1067200	1069200	wait, am I 100% on your name?
1071200	1072200	It's Joseph Skrimshaw.
1072200	1074200	I like that being part of my name, just the hesitation.
1074200	1077200	It's Joseph Skrimshaw.
1077200	1078200	That's a good name.
1078200	1083200	Alia Shawkat was on the show a couple episodes ago
1083200	1086200	and I can't even remember what I paused.
1086200	1088200	I was like, I don't think I've ever said her name out loud.
1088200	1090200	And then I was like, Alia Shawkat.
1092200	1094200	Anyways, it's enough about me.
1097200	1100200	So your podcast is called Obsessed?
1100200	1103200	Yeah, so it is a borderline sort of dangerous therapy
1103200	1106200	because I thought it would be fun and funny
1106200	1108200	to ask people what they're obsessed with
1108200	1110200	and then kind of comically rate them
1110200	1112200	and then a lot of times people are like...
1112200	1114200	Rate, he said rate.
1116200	1118200	You can do that comically.
1118200	1119200	Yes.
1120200	1124200	Consensual rating happens on my podcast.
1126200	1129200	And sometimes people are dangerously into the thing
1129200	1131200	and then I never have the guts to say,
1131200	1133200	like, yeah, you have a problem.
1133200	1134200	How do you tell the difference?
1134200	1135200	I think you're pretty healthy.
1135200	1136200	Because Dustin suggested,
1136200	1138200	well, maybe you should think of the things you're obsessed with.
1138200	1139200	And I started to kind of tailspin
1139200	1143200	because I think my therapist has used the word obsessive
1143200	1144200	in reference to me.
1144200	1146200	I don't think she's being officially diagnostic
1146200	1147200	in that capacity.
1147200	1149200	But she's saying, you have to understand
1149200	1153200	that when you start thinking about something,
1153200	1155200	it's hard for you to get off of it.
1155200	1156200	Right.
1158200	1160200	So that goes for anything.
1160200	1164200	And then I was wondering, is there a difference
1164200	1171200	between first of all, obsession, loving something?
1171200	1173200	I feel like there's a difference there
1173200	1175200	because you can love, aunt, slash, hate.
1175200	1177200	You could be obsessed with cockroaches
1177200	1179200	and not want them to crawl on your arm.
1179200	1181200	And then there's that third thing,
1181200	1184200	which is just addiction or compulsion.
1184200	1186200	Do you draw lines between these things?
1186200	1188200	If somebody were to come on your podcast,
1188200	1190200	Matt Gorley said he was obsessed with quicksand.
1190200	1191200	Right.
1191200	1193200	He thinks about quicksand all the time,
1193200	1194200	or he did in his childhood.
1194200	1195200	You guys talked about that.
1195200	1196200	Yeah.
1196200	1198200	And he obsessively makes quicksand still.
1198200	1199200	He does.
1199200	1202200	Like he knows the recipe of the perfect quicksand from the 80s.
1202200	1206200	Like he knows how much oatmeal to use and shit like that.
1208200	1210200	So are there lines between that?
1210200	1212200	Do you ever have people, you email them and go,
1212200	1213200	hey, what are you obsessed with?
1213200	1214200	And they write you back.
1214200	1216200	And do you ever write them back and go,
1216200	1221200	well, everybody's obsessed with masturbation.
1223200	1225200	No one has offered masturbation.
1225200	1228200	If they offered masturbation, I would take it in a second.
1228200	1229200	All right.
1229200	1231200	Well, I guess now we know what this episode is.
1231200	1235200	I would be happy to talk with you together about masturbation.
1235200	1238200	My short list was because I didn't know.
1238200	1239200	Well, I'm sorry.
1239200	1240200	You can finish answering my question.
1240200	1241200	Oh, yeah.
1241200	1243200	I think the big thing that I feel like I have learned
1243200	1245200	about obsession doing this for a couple of years
1245200	1249200	is that when people try to take a thing out of the element
1249200	1251200	that it lives in, like a lot of times people
1251200	1254200	will like a band or a TV show.
1254200	1257200	And to me, I'm truly obsessed with it when you find other ways
1257200	1259200	to make it be a part of you.
1259200	1260200	Oh, fun.
1260200	1262200	So like when you like really like something like,
1262200	1263200	oh, I like that TV show.
1263200	1265200	Some people are like, I think I'm obsessed with Twin Peaks
1265200	1266200	because I watched it all once.
1266200	1268200	We're like, no, no.
1268200	1270200	Other people are like, no, I have a tattoo
1270200	1273200	and I have to look at it at 12.47 every day.
1273200	1275200	It's of an owl from Twin Peaks.
1275200	1278200	It's when people try to make it a part of their lives
1278200	1281200	outside of the original origin of the thing.
1281200	1282200	Right.
1282200	1285200	It's like our friend Derek Mears, who Derek's been on the show.
1285200	1286200	Hasn't he?
1286200	1287200	Yeah.
1287200	1288200	Yeah.
1288200	1291200	He plays Jason Voorhees or did in some of the Friday the 13th.
1291200	1293200	And he went to some horror convention
1293200	1296200	and a guy came up to him and he had a tattoo of the Jason mask
1296200	1298200	on the back of his shaved head.
1298200	1302200	And he asked Derek to sign the base of his neck.
1302200	1305200	And Derek's like, no, because I know what you're going to do.
1305200	1306200	And he's like, just sign it.
1306200	1308200	He's like, I'm not going to sign it so you can get a tattoo.
1308200	1309200	He's like, I just signed my neck.
1309200	1310200	So Derek reluctantly did it.
1310200	1313200	The guy came back the next day with the cellophane on it
1313200	1314200	and the Vaseline.
1314200	1317200	It's like now forever he's got Derek's name
1317200	1319200	in a Sharpie tattooed on the base of his neck.
1319200	1323200	Yeah, not to derail, but I'm kind of fascinated now
1323200	1325200	with what Derek's, you know.
1325200	1329200	I remember feeling that way when I was 27
1329200	1333200	and somebody, like I was working with Schwab in comic books
1333200	1334200	and somebody would come up.
1334200	1336200	Well, I remember a girl, I've told the story,
1336200	1339200	a girl who was a super fan of an improv troupe
1339200	1341200	we were in in Milwaukee.
1341200	1344200	And the night that we announced we were breaking up,
1344200	1351200	she came into the dressing room with a basketball-sized tattoo
1351200	1356200	of our 90s John Krikfalusi looking logo on her thigh
1356200	1358200	saying like, I wish you had told me.
1359200	1366200	And I don't know, you know, I am a little interested in like,
1366200	1368200	but that guy, I don't know.
1368200	1371200	That guy also, when he showed Derek his license,
1371200	1374200	he had legally changed his name to Jason Voorhees.
1374200	1376200	That was his name on his driver's license.
1376200	1380200	Okay, but that's not why Derek didn't want to put his signature
1380200	1381200	on the back of his head.
1381200	1383200	Derek didn't want to feel responsible for this guy's
1383200	1384200	obsession?
1384200	1385200	Art on his neck.
1385200	1391200	Like, why do you want my signature on you for life that's weird?
1391200	1393200	Like, I don't want to be, not like you're a weirdo,
1393200	1395200	but just like I don't want to have that much influence
1395200	1396200	on the rest of your life.
1396200	1398200	Yeah, he should have like written his name and then underneath.
1398200	1399200	Do not tattoo and see.
1401200	1404200	Do you think in Derek's mind this is where I would access it,
1404200	1410200	it would be like the equivalent of if you were a female performer
1410200	1416200	and somebody, a girl, a young girl came up to you and somehow,
1416200	1417200	like I'm trying to riff an example.
1417200	1419200	It's going to get me all kinds of trouble, but I'm like,
1419200	1421200	also it's like on this clear side of like,
1421200	1425200	like if somebody was like, can you, can you, I'm so,
1425200	1430200	I'm so inspired by you and, and how beautiful you are.
1430200	1432200	And I like, can you like, I don't know.
1432200	1434200	I'm trying to, what's the fucking example?
1434200	1439200	Like sign this tiny sandwich container.
1439200	1442200	So every time I think of you, I can eat the smaller sandwich
1442200	1445200	or something and that you would go, I don't want to lend my,
1445200	1449200	I don't want to endorse your, your,
1449200	1451200	something that I think you actually need to deal with is that,
1451200	1452200	that's what I'm trying to get at.
1454200	1457200	I think for Derek, if it was more just a little bit of bashfulness,
1457200	1460200	like he didn't feel like that was, he was maybe worthy of that.
1460200	1463200	Which I don't think, if that's the only reason that I kind of came full,
1463200	1465200	like, cause I used to, I used to go,
1465200	1468200	oh, that's a character from a comic book that my friend,
1468200	1472200	Rob drew, I, dude, that's not important.
1472200	1474200	Like now it's going to be on your calf forever.
1474200	1475200	Like that's no good.
1475200	1479200	But then I started to, at some point I was like, well,
1479200	1481200	I guess it was probably all the community tattoos.
1481200	1482200	I was like, this is fine.
1482200	1483200	Yeah.
1483200	1486200	This is, this is absolutely justified behavior.
1486200	1487200	Yeah.
1487200	1490200	Joseph, did you start this because are you obsessive about things?
1490200	1491200	I am a very obsessive person.
1491200	1495200	Do you have a list of things or is there all under one umbrella of obsessions?
1495200	1498200	No, I have a whole list of things.
1498200	1500200	It's a little bit, I'm sure the joke has been made.
1500200	1501200	You're obsessed with obsession, obviously.
1501200	1502200	I am, yeah.
1502200	1503200	You started a podcast about it.
1503200	1504200	Yeah.
1504200	1506200	But I mean, there's always been media I've really liked.
1506200	1515200	A big Star Wars guy in college, I got really into squirrels.
1515200	1516200	When you say you got into squirrels.
1516200	1518200	Into squirrels.
1518200	1520200	I don't know if you know this about squirrels on campuses,
1520200	1522200	but they're very friendly.
1522200	1523200	They're extra friendly.
1523200	1526200	Also, squirrels on film.
1526200	1527200	Yeah.
1527200	1528200	Well, there was a squirrel in my neighborhood.
1528200	1530200	I mean, squirrels are very easily.
1530200	1531200	They're so close to cats.
1531200	1532200	They're like evolutionarily.
1532200	1535200	I mean, they'll, they'll, they will.
1535200	1539200	I mean, yeah, if you, like anywhere that they're not getting actively killed
1539200	1542200	all the time, they'll like, if you go like this with your finger,
1542200	1543200	they'll crawl up your leg.
1543200	1544200	Yeah.
1544200	1546200	And like, because they think you might have a peanut or something.
1546200	1547200	Yeah.
1547200	1548200	There was a kid in my neighborhood.
1548200	1551200	There was a squirrel named Charlie who would do, who did that.
1551200	1554200	And it clearly had been like trained or something.
1554200	1556200	How did you discover its name was Charlie?
1556200	1557200	We all called it Charlie.
1557200	1558200	I don't know.
1558200	1560200	It was, it was, it was folklore.
1560200	1561200	I don't know.
1561200	1562200	Charlie's.
1562200	1564200	That was a very squirrel obsessed question.
1564200	1567200	Like you, how did you get so close to the squirrel?
1567200	1569200	Like he, he told you his name.
1569200	1571200	I remember just crawl up your leg.
1571200	1573200	It was the most amazing thing to have a squirrel.
1573200	1575200	Like, like, like use your pant leg.
1575200	1578200	Like, like, yeah, like scale you as if you're a tree and you're like,
1578200	1579200	and it's like right there.
1579200	1580200	It's a wild animal.
1580200	1583200	But it's like, and then you just feed it a little nut or something or,
1583200	1587200	or you go, sorry, I was just seeing if you do that.
1587200	1589200	I don't walk around with nuts.
1589200	1590200	I saw you.
1590200	1594200	And what form, Joseph, what form does your squirrel or did your squirrel
1594200	1595200	obsession take?
1595200	1597200	Like, how did that manifest?
1597200	1602200	So I was doing like just sketch comedy stuff and I was doing such comedy
1602200	1603200	with my brother and he was like, Hey,
1603200	1606200	I think what this sketch needs is for you to be dressed as a squirrel.
1606200	1608200	And my girlfriend does costume design.
1608200	1610200	So she wants to make you a squirrel costume.
1610200	1611200	So I was like, sure.
1611200	1612200	Okay.
1612200	1614200	So I dressed up as a squirrel.
1614200	1617200	And then I decided like, Oh, I should be like real method about this.
1617200	1622200	So you didn't know that you had a squirrel thing until this.
1622200	1623200	Yeah.
1623200	1624200	This is your origin story.
1624200	1625200	Yeah.
1625200	1628200	This is how I became squirrel man.
1628200	1629200	Yeah.
1629200	1632200	So then I started watching squirrels all the time.
1632200	1635200	And I think the thing that has not on TV.
1635200	1636200	Yeah.
1636200	1637200	In real life.
1637200	1638200	Yeah.
1638200	1639200	In real life.
1639200	1640200	Um, because I don't want to get political,
1640200	1643200	but there's not a lot of squirrels on TV.
1643200	1646200	No, it's pretty much a rocky.
1646200	1651200	And when they are, they're like, Oh, I love nuts.
1651200	1652200	You're a writer.
1652200	1655200	I've noticed you haven't put a lot of squirrels in your shows.
1655200	1656200	Yeah.
1656200	1660200	But the thing is that's, that's because of meritocracy.
1660200	1663200	The fact is you need to talk to the agencies.
1663200	1665200	There's not a lot of talented squirrels out there.
1665200	1666200	Damn it.
1666200	1668200	You can deflect all you want.
1668200	1670200	Big old squirrel planet and Rick and Morty.
1670200	1671200	I think it would work.
1671200	1672200	All right.
1672200	1675200	So give us, give us another obsession.
1675200	1677200	Give us another specific.
1677200	1681200	This sounds like a joke because it is, but it is also true.
1681200	1684200	To be fair, squirrels sounded like a joke too.
1684200	1687200	I have, I have been thinking a lot about shame.
1687200	1691200	I have been sort of obsessed with how people internalize shame.
1691200	1696200	Cause I think a lot of comedians make jokes about feeling great shame.
1696200	1698200	But, and I do that too.
1698200	1699200	And then I also do feel shame.
1699200	1703200	So I right now I've been obsessed with thinking about exactly how we all
1703200	1706200	develop our different ways of sort of internalizing that we should feel
1706200	1709200	guilty and question everything we say.
1709200	1712200	Did you change the subject from squirrels?
1712200	1714200	They kind of, they kind of go hand in hand.
1714200	1717200	Because squirrels are burying their shame.
1717200	1719200	I asked him for another example.
1719200	1720200	Oh, okay.
1720200	1721200	That was fucked up.
1721200	1723200	I mean, we hadn't, I mean, getting a straight answer on this squirrel thing.
1723200	1725200	Did you ever get to the bottom of it?
1725200	1726200	I think that.
1726200	1730200	Jeff, don't you be ashamed of yourself.
1730200	1731200	Dan, you're obsessing right now.
1731200	1732200	I'm in a weird mood tonight.
1732200	1735200	And I, I think I did one of those things where I forgot I took the Adderall
1735200	1739200	and then I took another one.
1739200	1742200	And then also thought, cause I was in Westwood, I was like, oh, it's going to
1742200	1743200	be a really long Uber drive.
1743200	1745200	So I, I, I felt okay.
1745200	1748200	Like taking an extra like vape hit on the, on the thing.
1749200	1751200	And then I was like, and then I got here and I was like, you came in and I was
1751200	1753200	like, oh, social.
1753200	1754200	Yeah.
1754200	1757200	This is perfect for my squirrel obsession because the reason I'm obsessed
1757200	1761200	with them is I love how much they are full of energy and then suddenly slow
1761200	1764200	down and just focus on one thing.
1764200	1767200	And I feel like maybe that's the drug combination that you've created.
1767200	1768200	All right.
1768200	1769200	Yeah.
1769200	1770200	It's called a speed ball.
1770200	1772200	What does squirrels slow down for?
1772200	1775200	Do you mean hibernating or do you just mean like when, when you catch them at a
1775200	1776200	good time?
1776200	1779200	Well, uh, yeah, sometimes they just like totally chill out.
1779200	1783200	It's in this very fixated way, this very obsessed way, but you know, they will
1783200	1785200	be like, I'm, I'm excited by everything around me.
1785200	1789200	I have to analyze everything and then they'll just like settle into one thing.
1789200	1792200	Yeah.
1792200	1794200	I'm sitting in an audience member.
1794200	1798200	I don't even know why, but it's fucking captivating.
1798200	1799200	I can't let go of it.
1799200	1803200	And there's something like both like a ridiculous and noble about that weird
1803200	1806200	squirrel movement that just like makes sense to me in a strange way.
1806200	1811200	Squirrels kind of trick you because they're notoriously skittish.
1811200	1813200	They, they, uh, they, they scamper and they hide.
1813200	1814200	They're squirrely.
1814200	1815200	And if they see you, they're better.
1815200	1818200	They're super squirrely.
1818200	1819200	More stereotyping.
1819200	1822200	You'll, you'll see them climb up a tree and you'll get, you'll walk toward you.
1822200	1825200	I want to get close up to that squirrel on, on the tree.
1825200	1828200	And then it goes around the tree and hides from the other side of the tree.
1828200	1829200	Yeah.
1829200	1830200	But then it'll kind of poke his head around there.
1830200	1832200	And like, you think, okay, just scroll.
1832200	1834200	He knows that I'm his friend.
1834200	1836200	I'm going to get close to the squirrel.
1836200	1837200	And now they just lie.
1837200	1838200	Yeah.
1838200	1839200	No.
1839200	1843200	I like that they are, they alone, I mean, lots of rodents can climb trees.
1843200	1844200	Yeah.
1844200	1847200	Um, uh, but, but they, they really make a Spiderman business.
1847200	1849200	I like when they're going down vertically.
1849200	1850200	When they're climbing down.
1850200	1851200	They go nuts.
1851200	1854200	They, they really go nuts.
1854200	1858200	For the, for the fresh almond taste of new.
1859200	1861200	But like with the climbing trees down and they're just,
1861200	1863200	it's totally natural for them to be pointing straight down.
1863200	1865200	And it looks like just like, just like they're going up the tail doesn't,
1865200	1867200	the tail doesn't flop over.
1867200	1869200	Tail stays right where it should be.
1869200	1870200	I bet they barely know.
1870200	1873200	I bet for them it's like when you play an alien in that old alien versus predator
1873200	1874200	game.
1874200	1877200	And it's like, you get, you have to like retrain your brain to like not, you
1877200	1879200	know, think of anything as the floor.
1879200	1881200	I bet that's how squirrels feel.
1881200	1883200	I bet they, I bet they give zero fucks.
1883200	1884200	Yeah.
1884200	1885200	Which is up and down.
1885200	1886200	I think they don't give a fuck.
1886200	1887200	I think they, they act squirrely.
1887200	1890200	They probably give more fucks than an insect and I'm obsessed with insects.
1890200	1891200	You are.
1891200	1892200	Yeah.
1892200	1893200	Okay.
1893200	1894200	I mean, but not to the point where I'm smart about them.
1894200	1897200	I don't read about, I don't read about anything.
1897200	1898200	I don't think obsession is about knowledge.
1898200	1900200	I think it's about how much you think about it.
1900200	1901200	I don't think it's about knowledge.
1901200	1903200	Sometimes people come on the podcast and they want to be like, I've looked up
1903200	1905200	all of the facts about new kids on the block or whatever.
1905200	1908200	And like, I don't care how much you know about new kids on the block.
1908200	1909200	It's how you, it affects you.
1909200	1911200	Oh, it's so you, that's a good example.
1911200	1913200	Like to use new kids on the block, like, like, yeah,
1913200	1915200	looking up all the facts about them.
1915200	1919200	Um, it wouldn't break into obsession because that's something a fan might do.
1919200	1926200	Obsession is the threshold between that and, um, uh, like, like, like, like,
1926200	1929200	it's, it's taking a piece of new kids on the block and like somehow.
1929200	1930200	God damn it.
1930200	1934200	I thought, I don't know why I, I thought I had a point and it was just your
1934200	1935200	point from before it.
1935200	1939200	But it's, it's, it's like saying like, oh, I, the, the new kids on the block,
1939200	1942200	like, like this is a, I made a new kids on the block cookie jar,
1942200	1944200	but it's like beyond, it's not just fandom.
1944200	1948200	It's like, um, I did it because I feel like the new kids on the block music,
1948200	1950200	like, would hold cookies better.
1950200	1951200	Yeah.
1951200	1952200	I don't know.
1952200	1955200	Like, it's extrapolation on a, on a kind of a, a kind of a.
1955200	1956200	Yeah.
1956200	1959200	It's, it's, it's giving that, that the thing you're talking about,
1959200	1962200	meaning that it, that it doesn't, that it shouldn't have like that.
1962200	1965200	You've taken, it's taking it out of its realm and putting it into some other
1965200	1968200	realm that affects you in some way that it shouldn't ever have been supposed to.
1968200	1969200	Right.
1969200	1970200	Yeah.
1970200	1971200	Trying to make it a part of you.
1971200	1972200	And sometimes people in the podcast aren't like, they're just like,
1972200	1974200	I like it in a super, super healthy way.
1974200	1976200	Uh, but I love it when it's just affected people in a really weird way.
1976200	1978200	I wouldn't say I'm obsessed.
1978200	1981200	Every time there's a lyric that I'm singing along and the word is girl or world,
1981200	1982200	I say squirrel.
1982200	1984200	I just do that automatically.
1984200	1985200	I fucking love you.
1985200	1986200	Yeah.
1986200	1989200	Because like, like, when we, like Greg Pribbs and Ryan Stiles,
1989200	1992200	like we, we'll make that five minutes of our show of just doing all of that.
1992200	1995200	You're like, squirrel, squirrel, squirrels.
1995200	1997200	Had nuts and fuzzy but.
1997200	1998200	Yeah.
1998200	2000200	I like squirrel, you're going to be a woman soon.
2000200	2001200	I like this.
2001200	2002200	I love it.
2002200	2003200	Very complex.
2003200	2005200	Because the squirrel is brown.
2005200	2007200	It turns me on.
2007200	2009200	Oh, that's a good one.
2009200	2010200	Yeah.
2010200	2012200	I don't like you guys getting along like this.
2012200	2014200	All right.
2014200	2016200	But that doesn't count as obsession.
2016200	2018200	That's just more of just kind of a fetish, right?
2018200	2019200	That's just fun.
2019200	2020200	Yeah, that's a fetish.
2020200	2021200	Yeah.
2021200	2022200	That's a fun improv game fetish.
2022200	2023200	Well, yeah, fetish.
2023200	2025200	Because like, I made a, I made a quick list like on my way out the door.
2025200	2026200	Okay, cool.
2026200	2029200	I was like, okay, pantyhose, redheads, Minecraft, race, personal technology,
2029200	2033200	rules, structure, coconuts, and biology.
2033200	2035200	But some of those are fetishes.
2035200	2036200	Right.
2036200	2037200	Pantyhose is a fetish.
2037200	2044200	It's like, I can't ignore, I can't not think about like sheer fabric.
2044200	2045200	Right.
2045200	2047200	It arouses you in a sexual manner.
2047200	2048200	If it's in the room, it doesn't matter.
2048200	2054200	It's not like if you're, you know, you don't have to worry about me like babysitting your
2055200	2058200	sheer fabric-clad nana.
2058200	2065200	I'm not going to do anything because of it, but I am going to be unable to ignore.
2065200	2067200	Is it that you need to look at it?
2067200	2068200	Yes.
2068200	2069200	I don't need to touch it.
2069200	2070200	Okay.
2070200	2071200	I want to make that very clear, too.
2071200	2072200	But do you have to tell that to yourself?
2072200	2074200	Do you look at it and have to say, don't touch it.
2074200	2075200	Don't touch it?
2075200	2078200	Well, that gets, I mean, yeah.
2078200	2082200	Well, because I'm talking about, when you talk about a fabric fetish, it's so much
2082200	2086200	of it is like, what would that feel like, I guess.
2086200	2093200	So I got to be, even though it makes me feel unsafe, like I should say, yeah.
2093200	2097200	Well, that's like, it's like, I want to touch it.
2097200	2098200	Yeah.
2098200	2099200	Yeah.
2099200	2100200	Okay.
2100200	2101200	All right.
2101200	2103200	Was there a childhood thing that made you attach to pantyhose or do you just associate
2103200	2104200	them with like legs?
2104200	2107200	I think the 70s was like a very pantyhose-clad time.
2107200	2108200	It really was.
2109200	2116200	It just, like on TV, which I spent most of my time watching, but then even the women
2116200	2121200	that would come over to visit with my parents, coworkers, and things, like any encounter
2121200	2125200	with femininity during that magical time when I'm sure.
2125200	2129200	My theory may be oversimplification, but I truly think that human beings are like these
2129200	2135200	little pieces of popcorn, and we simmer, and then you cannot control the moment that your
2135200	2136200	kid pops.
2136200	2137200	Right.
2137200	2140200	And at that point, like they might be looking at a coffee filter.
2140200	2147200	There's a good chance they're going to be looking at a previously propagated, like
2147200	2149200	mainstream kind of channel of sexuality.
2149200	2150200	Right.
2150200	2153200	But there's also like, then there's like all the ancillary stuff.
2153200	2158200	It's just like, I was probably under a table playing with toys and trucks because I didn't
2158200	2159200	like to look at people.
2159200	2161200	I didn't like to make eye contact.
2161200	2167200	And so I was frequently under the table, near the people, and I probably at that age
2167200	2169200	when everything just exploded.
2169200	2173200	When I think about it, it like spikes my, I'm like, yeah, I bet.
2173200	2180200	Like there were just like women with pantyhose on, like probably just like hanging out, like
2180200	2182200	playing dominoes or something above me.
2182200	2185200	And some of them were probably ants and, you know, who knows?
2185200	2186200	Right.
2186200	2189200	And that's probably where you get some of the dip and dangle and popping, like the shoe
2189200	2190200	stuff too.
2190200	2191200	It's just the whole thing.
2191200	2198200	I was like, that was, that was what the, that was, that was what femininity, sexuality, eroticism
2198200	2199200	was for me.
2199200	2207200	And then that was tied to like a bat, like bat girl and like, like, like, like the, the,
2207200	2211200	the, like women's legs clad in like sheer fabric.
2211200	2212200	Yeah.
2212200	2213200	That was like a superhero thing.
2213200	2219200	And it was also like a, like a, like the, the solid gold dancers and the, I don't know,
2219200	2224200	anything that had anything to do with the size and showmanship and like, uh, and your
2224200	2225200	own plane dominoes.
2225200	2227200	Lonnie Anderson on WKRP.
2227200	2232200	So does it transfer though from sexuality and from a women's legs to like, when you
2232200	2235200	see like a bank robbery on TV and something has like pantyhose?
2235200	2236200	Yes.
2236200	2237200	Yes.
2237200	2238200	Yes.
2238200	2239200	Yes.
2239200	2240200	I go, how can that guy rob that bank without getting a heart on?
2240200	2241200	Yes.
2241200	2242200	I go, that's fucking weird.
2242200	2246200	I don't, I don't literally, not literally, but, but, but, but I actually do think like,
2246200	2249200	like, like, like if I think about like when guys like in movies, when they were going
2249200	2251200	to rob a bank, a guy goes like, okay, put these on.
2251200	2253200	Like I get distracted by guys.
2253200	2257200	I go like, how come nobody's having a conversation about how this feels like perverted?
2257200	2263200	Like, because it's, it's pantyhose and I'll do you one better for nylon is frequently
2263200	2265200	used as a wind sock or whatever you call it.
2265200	2268200	Like for it to block your plosives in audio recording.
2268200	2271200	So you get the regular ones that you buy that they're professional.
2271200	2275200	But then if you don't have those on hand, you can make one of those coat hanger and
2275200	2276200	some pantyhose.
2276200	2277200	Yeah.
2277200	2281200	And so, yeah, like I don't want anybody else is probably just like, oh, that's just an
2281200	2282200	object.
2282200	2283200	And I get into a record booth.
2283200	2284200	I'm like, so anyway.
2284200	2285200	Whoa.
2285200	2286200	Okay.
2286200	2289200	Check, check, check, check.
2289200	2297200	There was a time, Dan, I think we're at the drawing room or somewhere.
2297200	2300200	And I had these new socks that like, they kind of pull all the way up and they were
2300200	2301200	very sheer.
2301200	2302200	I'm like, Hey, Dan, check these out.
2302200	2303200	Like, feel these.
2303200	2305200	And you reached over and felt them.
2305200	2308200	You're like, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
2308200	2309200	What are you?
2309200	2310200	What are you doing?
2310200	2311200	What are you doing?
2311200	2314200	It's like, oh shit, I forgot.
2314200	2317200	Well, no, you didn't forget you were fucking with me.
2317200	2320200	I never had you felt one of my slaps.
2320200	2321200	No, no, no.
2321200	2323200	I'm saying I didn't go into that thing.
2323200	2325200	It's thinking like, oh, I'm going to play with Dan's.
2325200	2326200	Yeah, you did.
2326200	2327200	That's why you brought it up.
2327200	2328200	Maybe, maybe.
2328200	2330200	But I didn't know that I was going to get that reaction.
2330200	2331200	I thought you would go.
2331200	2332200	Nice.
2332200	2335200	But you reached over and kind of just like reflexively just touched it.
2335200	2339200	And then you had this big reaction to it that I was not expecting at all.
2339200	2342200	Well, I, I would refine that memory and go like that.
2342200	2344200	You were, you were like, so what do you think of these?
2344200	2347200	And I was like, all right, take it easy.
2347200	2348200	And you're like, touch him.
2348200	2350200	I'm like, I'm not going to touch your fucking pantyhose socks.
2350200	2352200	And you're like, come on, touch him.
2352200	2353200	And I was like, all right, fine.
2353200	2354200	I'll touch him.
2354200	2355200	Jesus Christ.
2355200	2356200	What are you doing?
2356200	2358200	That's that's okay.
2358200	2359200	That sounds fair enough.
2360200	2362200	Now, Joseph, how would you rate that on your obsession?
2362200	2364200	Do you have an obsessive scale?
2364200	2365200	Yeah.
2365200	2366200	Yeah.
2366200	2367200	I asked questions.
2367200	2368200	Do you want to do it about pantyhose?
2368200	2370200	These are the questions that I used to write the obsession.
2370200	2371200	Dan also said coconuts.
2371200	2372200	I want to get back.
2372200	2373200	I'm going to put a pin in coconuts.
2373200	2374200	Okay.
2374200	2375200	You want to.
2375200	2376200	No, no, no.
2376200	2377200	Let's stick with pantyhose.
2377200	2378200	I want to see where this one falls.
2378200	2379200	All right.
2379200	2380200	Well, we'll do pantyhose and go to coconuts.
2380200	2383200	I feel like that's a fucking Marx Brothers movie.
2383200	2384200	For pantyhose coconuts?
2384200	2385200	Pantyhose and coconuts.
2386200	2387200	No, that's three.
2387200	2388200	That's two just.
2391200	2392200	Here's here's some of the questions.
2392200	2395200	Do you think about pantyhose every day?
2395200	2396200	Yes.
2396200	2399200	Like even if you don't see them, you'll just be walking along doing your
2399200	2402200	business and then just think pantyhose.
2403200	2404200	Yeah.
2406200	2409200	I think but I see them everywhere.
2409200	2411200	I mean, there was no way there'd be no way.
2411200	2414200	But if I was locked in a cell, which probably should be.
2416200	2418200	You'd be thinking about pantyhose 24 hours a day.
2418200	2419200	Definitely.
2419200	2421200	I would figure out a way to think about them.
2421200	2422200	Yeah.
2422200	2423200	You would like etch them on the walls of your prison.
2423200	2424200	They would come into my head.
2424200	2425200	Yeah.
2425200	2426200	Okay.
2426200	2428200	But like I always like I'll be watching a movie like I was just watching
2428200	2430200	Now You See Me Too.
2431200	2434200	And I just like I just it has nothing to do.
2434200	2436200	It's like God damn it.
2436200	2437200	I forgot her name.
2437200	2438200	Two broke girls.
2439200	2445200	They replaced Isla Fisher with her in a weird on the nose way.
2445200	2450200	Lizzie Kaplan is the new one female in Now You See Me Too.
2450200	2453200	They had 95 men and Woody Harrelson gets to play two men.
2453200	2457200	But Isla Fisher apparently now you don't.
2461200	2467200	And so Lizzie Kaplan at one point like she wears like knee high.
2467200	2472200	She wears like boots that come up past her knees and like not like a short skirt like
2472200	2473200	a thigh length skirt.
2473200	2476200	So there's there's like this much thigh showing.
2476200	2479200	And it has nothing to do with like prurient interest honestly.
2479200	2483200	And I was like trying to because I was watching it with Cody and it was just like I don't
2483200	2488200	know it's like like I like I but it goes in my head like if I see a shot in a movie where
2488200	2495200	anybody lands like or it's like like somebody's what like I just like I my mind like like
2495200	2500200	says whether or not they're wearing not like like pantyhose like you feel like you can identify
2500200	2501200	quickly.
2501200	2502200	Yes.
2502200	2503200	Like you're an expert.
2503200	2507200	And I ran through it with Cody because I feel more comfortable talking to her about this
2507200	2508200	stuff.
2508200	2511200	And it was like but and it was interesting because it wasn't a definitive thing.
2511200	2513200	And it was like it was definitive in my mind.
2513200	2514200	Yeah.
2514200	2517200	It was which I think is obsession because it's like why would you even have that because
2517200	2521200	she rewinded like and she was like well it's her legs are the same color as her face in
2521200	2522200	her hands.
2522200	2524200	The what are you basing it on.
2524200	2526200	And it was like I couldn't even really pinpoint it.
2526200	2528200	I was just like I don't know.
2528200	2530200	You have pantyhose confirmation bias.
2530200	2531200	I have.
2531200	2532200	I have.
2532200	2533200	I have.
2533200	2534200	I have.
2534200	2535200	I have.
2535200	2536200	Joseph I'm glad you finally said the words to him.
2536200	2537200	I have.
2537200	2540200	Because I've known him for so long and I just I just never feel like the time is right.
2540200	2541200	I have.
2541200	2545200	I have pantyhose confirmation apparatus which is already weird right.
2545200	2546200	Yes.
2546200	2547200	Like why you shouldn't even.
2547200	2548200	OK.
2548200	2552200	Not shouldn't I mean it doesn't matter but it's like it's not it's it's that denotes.
2552200	2553200	OK.
2553200	2554200	Every day.
2554200	2555200	Every day.
2555200	2556200	Every day.
2556200	2557200	OK.
2557200	2558200	Have you ever had a dream about pantyhose.
2558200	2559200	Yeah.
2559200	2560200	Well.
2560200	2564200	A wasted question on my part for sure.
2564200	2568200	If you could steal pantyhose from someone's home.
2568200	2569200	I have.
2569200	2572200	I have done it.
2572200	2582200	I was just going to apply to ants by the way or coconuts.
2582200	2585200	Well I guess I wouldn't steal coconuts from anyone.
2585200	2586200	I have.
2586200	2589200	I have robbed trusted.
2589200	2590200	Yeah.
2590200	2594200	I was you know I was younger and I crossed that threshold I was like oh you need to fucking
2594200	2595200	own this.
2595200	2596200	Yeah.
2596200	2597200	OK.
2597200	2598200	You stole pantyhose.
2598200	2601200	You need to go buy them at the grocery store and stop being embarrassed like you need to
2601200	2603200	like pretend you're buying toothpaste and also.
2603200	2608200	Are they like hidden behind your air conditioner like Dexter's blood slides or like what do
2608200	2609200	you do.
2609200	2610200	Did you collect them when you stole them.
2610200	2611200	No they weren't like.
2611200	2612200	It wasn't.
2612200	2614200	It wasn't like about her like sniffy like panty.
2614200	2618200	No I wasn't like I'm taking an article women's clothing because of her.
2618200	2621200	I was I keep I keep going like oh no no not like that.
2621200	2622200	And I don't want any.
2622200	2624200	I don't want anyone listening that has any predilections.
2624200	2627200	I mean I don't want anyone to ever feel ashamed of themselves but I did.
2627200	2629200	So I'm pulling back on my pulling back.
2629200	2633200	But no for me it was like no it was like a new package and I was like fuck I'm never
2633200	2634200	going to get this chance again.
2634200	2635200	OK.
2635200	2639200	But then you just appreciated them like you just like appreciated them.
2640200	2641200	Yeah.
2642200	2647200	While while while kneeling and rubbing his nipple and listening to Radiohead.
2647200	2649200	Yeah I jerked off with them.
2649200	2650200	OK.
2650200	2654200	I have at one point I was like well maybe you're I mean come on maybe you're like I
2654200	2655200	wouldn't.
2655200	2657200	I like tried them on and let's see if that's working.
2657200	2658200	Yeah.
2658200	2662200	You know that that didn't work out and like the but I've done I've done everything you
2662200	2663200	could think of.
2663200	2666200	And that's why you don't know me as well as these kids.
2666200	2671200	Yeah I have like I have mannequin legs and things that I'll I put I buy I go to the
2671200	2672200	store and buy them.
2672200	2673200	Now there's Amazon.
2673200	2677200	Thank God you just get a box of and then just on the leg.
2677200	2678200	Now I have it.
2678200	2681200	Now I have a girlfriend who knows the whole score.
2681200	2686200	So I don't really have to right now do a lot of like commerce based.
2688200	2690200	What's the next question Joseph.
2690200	2694200	But yes I yes yes I would steal them from someone's home.
2694200	2699200	But I say that with all due shame because I was like twenty three.
2699200	2703200	And as soon as I did it I was like this is huge.
2703200	2704200	You need to do.
2704200	2705200	I'm not.
2705200	2708200	I don't mean I just want to clarify.
2708200	2709200	I don't think it's cool to steal from people.
2709200	2710200	Right.
2710200	2711200	Right.
2711200	2712200	No.
2712200	2714200	I like it was it was a if you were you've done it.
2714200	2716200	You'd be robbing banks with a boner.
2719200	2720200	That'd be funny.
2721200	2722200	By the way.
2722200	2723200	What's the worst.
2723200	2724200	What's the worst.
2725200	2726200	This poor female friend.
2726200	2729200	She she finishes doing dishes and comes upstairs like what are you doing.
2729200	2732200	And I've got the pantyhose on my head and I'm like I'm robbing you.
2732200	2733200	And she's like of what.
2733200	2734200	And I'm like these tonight.
2735200	2737200	I just run out with them on my face.
2741200	2743200	And she's like well I don't want those.
2745200	2746200	They're for ninety nine.
2747200	2748200	Well I'm embarrassed.
2748200	2749200	I didn't want to think I'm a pervert.
2751200	2752200	Can I tell you just.
2752200	2753200	Please.
2753200	2754200	Please.
2754200	2764440	I was during a barbecue at a platonic friend's place and during it I like I not only did
2764440	2771200	I I didn't just I took I had she had a lot of them and and wore a lot of them.
2771200	2772200	God bless her.
2773200	2778200	And I felt like she would never miss them because if I did like so because I was like
2778200	2782200	Howard Lee things if I thought it would be noticeable it was like because of the circumstances
2782200	2784200	was like this is your big chance.
2785200	2790200	Now I look back on that go you fucking pussy just just own your perversion and like go
2790200	2793200	to the but but but this was my first kind of reckoning.
2794200	2796200	We're going to say own your perversion and go to the grocery store.
2797200	2799200	I just I want that phrase out in the world.
2800200	2802200	It's my it's my license plate frame.
2802200	2804200	That's that's your keep keep calm and carry on.
2808200	2814200	I took I took I took a package of of some of the dress up in squirrels.
2815200	2816200	And I'm going to Ralph's.
2820200	2822200	I I hid them in a bush.
2826200	2828200	That I would that that between our homes.
2829200	2830200	Just just like a squirrel.
2837200	2842200	I hope that my candor somehow this is great balance is that no but I also feel like I'm
2842200	2847200	a woman and I'm listening and I'm going like I knew it like like like about about that
2847200	2851200	gender in general but yeah I guess if there's anything I can do to encourage that fear I
2851200	2852200	would.
2853200	2855200	Like we're like we're we're we're dangerous people.
2856200	2857200	All right next question.
2857200	2858200	All right.
2858200	2859200	Sounds good.
2859200	2860200	I was a friend and I hit her panty.
2860200	2861200	I was in a bush.
2862200	2865200	So I could take him home and that's I mean that's fucked up.
2865200	2867200	I'm just admitting this now for the first time out loud.
2867200	2869200	You put them in the bush so you can retrieve them later on.
2870200	2870200	
2870200	2871200	And take them home.
2871200	2874200	I was like I was like I'm going to put these here because I'm not going to walk around
2874200	2877200	at the party within a full what kind of package.
2878200	2881200	Well they were they were they were the Haynes like in the flat package.
2881200	2882200	Gotcha.
2882200	2883200	So yeah you couldn't just put those in your pocket.
2883200	2884200	Gotcha.
2884200	2885200	Yeah I could.
2885200	2888200	Well I could have but that would have taken like any some strange form of courage in the
2888200	2890200	face of my coward.
2890200	2891200	Yeah.
2891200	2892200	Every move had to be cowardly.
2892200	2893200	So.
2893200	2896200	But you had to get them out of a room to an outdoor area where there was a bush.
2896200	2897200	Yeah.
2897200	2899200	So how did you get them like you put them inside your sweater.
2899200	2905200	Like what if it was a barbecue I just put I tucked them away and like I'm like I got
2905200	2908200	to get rid of this shame so I can forget about it now that I've committed the crime profit
2908200	2909200	at myself.
2909200	2910200	I'll just bury the body.
2910200	2912200	Go back to the barbecue.
2912200	2915200	And then oh look what I found in this bush.
2915200	2916200	When did you.
2917200	2919200	When did you return to the bush after the party was over.
2919200	2920200	Yeah.
2920200	2921200	Like in the middle of the night or what.
2922200	2923200	I don't know.
2924200	2925200	Were people still there.
2925200	2927200	After the after I was done at the barbecue.
2927200	2928200	Yeah.
2928200	2932200	I was just like I was going like I have this weird chance with all these circumstances
2932200	2938200	like like I at that time the whole thing with the whole context was I never thought it
2938200	2945200	was possible to be so unashamed of this like fascination and obsession that I that I felt
2945200	2950200	that there was no Amazon and there was no I just I just I had and I had never just like
2950200	2952200	bought a pair of pantyhose.
2952200	2953200	This is your only access then.
2953200	2954200	This was the opportunity.
2954200	2961200	This was the threshold like from like looking at photos of women wearing it and to like
2961200	2965200	and I was like I've never I've never actually like really.
2965200	2969200	Had you ever thought about before that moment had you ever thought about could I just go
2969200	2971200	and buy them or that not occurred to you at all.
2971200	2976200	I thought about it and then I had been like I can't do that because like I was I don't
2976200	2977200	know.
2977200	2978200	I was just scared.
2978200	2981200	I was so ashamed like I just thought I don't know what I thought would happen.
2981200	2985200	It's like somebody would go at the grocery store I would go so toothpaste and what are
2985200	2992200	these for because it's not Halloween and these are taupe they're not like Robin Hood.
2992200	2993200	What are you doing.
2993200	2994200	What are you doing buddy.
2994200	2995200	I don't know.
2995200	2998200	It's like when you feel shame like you don't even really to me it's like it's not there's
2998200	2999200	nothing logical about it.
2999200	3007200	Like it's it's you you think everyone everyone will know and like like things that they
3007200	3012200	would have you you bother to run through it's like the telltale heart you know it's like
3012200	3017200	yeah like you're you do the extra math like like it's so it's so the things that you'll
3017200	3020200	do to avoid right you imagine what everybody else and that's the dangerous thing about
3020200	3025200	shame which is why it's like that's the thing is like the more the creepier a thing
3025200	3029200	the more that we don't want to look at it and like we go like oh well I know one thing
3029200	3033200	for sure I feel better about myself as a mainstream citizen because that guy's really weird the
3033200	3039200	thing is the there's a little tax levied on that I think and like this isn't self
3039200	3044200	justification this is like my because of my taste of it I feel bad for people that like
3044200	3049200	wouldn't be able to say into a podcast and therefore feel like yeah get some sleep at
3049200	3053200	night I mean I think that's a positive part of discussing obsessions is I think in general
3053200	3057200	our culture is moving towards sort of like whatever you love you do you and be loud and
3057200	3061200	proud and about it and I think that it is great that you are being loud and proud about
3061200	3068200	pantyhose loud but not just just loud just real quick I want to get back to the question
3068200	3072200	on pantyhose but I have a side question yeah the last question was have you ever stolen
3072200	3078200	yeah have you ever stolen blank but let's say we had picked race which is one of the
3078200	3088200	things you ever stolen race I've co-opted it we all have it's called rock and roll
3088200	3099200	do you I steal race every day built this city on appropriation do you do you just not use
3099200	3103200	that question or do you apply that question somehow like you have you ever stolen you
3103200	3106200	couldn't yeah I try I alter them if I have to I had somebody who just wanted to talk
3106200	3114200	about fear you know and I didn't ask them would you steal fear because you didn't want
3114200	3129200	to accidentally launch a DC comic man of steel do you steal fear who are you fear thief my
3129200	3146200	story begins in Saigon yeah so I tried to alter them moving on maybe okay I want Armenian
3146200	3152200	fan art of fear thief I think it because it's like an FX series because it would just say
3152200	3158200	fear period thief period but the title of show be fear thief dot-com hashtag like you
3158200	3166200	know okay would you discuss pantyhose with Hitler would I discuss pantyhose with Hitler
3166200	3175200	yeah almost certainly yeah cuz I got a figure he's tired of talking about genocide and I'm
3175200	3179200	not gonna ask any new questions no no I don't really have Hitler would talk about race maybe
3179200	3184200	maybe not coconut yes I would I would I mean if I'm gonna I'm gonna create a situation
3184200	3192200	where I'm in a conversation with Hitler absolutely because it would it never happened forget
3192200	3202200	what you've read at Alex Jones YouTube site YouTube site okay Grandpa what's Alex Jones
3202200	3214200	YouTube site again YouTube fucking I figure it's like a cosmic situation yeah I'm like
3214200	3220200	and I'm kind of stuck with Hitler for a while right I'm going there to like I can't kill
3220200	3225200	him and I can't like talk him out of you know I can't I'm not gonna I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm absolved
3225200	3230200	of like yeah yeah yeah like engineering like I you know I don't have to do anything that
3230200	3236200	people are gonna yell at me for doing yeah you're stuck in a void with Hitler you could
3236200	3241200	have killed Hitler I would I would I would I would I would go I would you know I would
3241200	3246200	go like oh hey Hitler like I'm picturing like we're like treading treading like it's
3246200	3252200	theory like like because we've both had some cool bricky and fucking mishap and so I'm
3252200	3256200	just like eye to eye with him like and some weird like whirlpool and we're like I don't
3256200	3260200	know how long we'll be facing each other and like Michelangelo's whipping by going
3260200	3274200	like and of course Marco Polo like Marco he'll be back again the but then and then I'm like
3274200	3278200	for some reason I'm like faced off with Hitler like it's like like the currents going both
3278200	3284200	are with Hitler and he's like Dan Harmon and I'm like like did you so you're familiar with
3284200	3290200	me and he'd be like like yes for whatever reason I yeah I saw community he was like
3290200	3300200	did you like it he's like yes and I'm like yes shitty I just want everyone to like it
3300200	3306200	but it's Hitler so we'd get my shit out of the way and then I'd go like I'd go like so
3306200	3312200	why Hitler like why would you do that do what like well why did you why did Hitler everybody
3312200	3318200	says well I didn't okay well that's what everybody says nobody says I didn't I'm not
3318200	3323200	Hitler and then I go like well so like what what tell me like what you were really passionate
3323200	3329200	about because there's the whole art versus like genocide dichotomy as if if your teacher had
3329200	3332200	told you you drew good you wouldn't have killed six million people and he's like I'm gonna
3332200	3335200	stop you there I didn't kill six million people I was like I don't want to I don't want to
3335200	3339200	have I don't want to take part in a revisionist conversation Hitler and he'd be like oh he's
3340200	3344200	like don't don't don't compare me to Hitler just to win an argument I'm like you're Hitler
3346200	3351200	so eventually it would it would run into like this rhetoric wall right like and I would go
3351200	3355200	and I've got okay fine so let's talk about anything other than the Hitler stuff and he'd
3355200	3361200	be like yeah if you don't mind and I'd be like fine and I would I think one of the third
3361200	3365200	or fifth things I would get around to is like what is it so what are you into like like
3365200	3369200	dude like what popped your little kernel popcorn yeah like what do you are you like
3369200	3373200	you think you're a little like where do you think you are the kids you scale or like like like
3373200	3377200	like like what did you like you like are you a boob man a butt man a leg man like I would
3377200	3381200	have gotten there yeah okay so do you feel like if you're you're swimming in a theory
3381200	3386200	you were swimming in the void that did not have water treading a theory anyway I coined
3386200	3391200	a theory and if you ever tread in it from now on you owe me five cents a minute so you're
3391200	3398200	treading a theory just such a great drug term and Hitler comes up to you right and
3398200	3403200	says like I'd like to engage you about pantyhose oh you'd be like no fuck off Hitler I'm not
3403200	3409200	no I would be like holy shit what is there so it's pantyhose are more significant than
3409200	3415200	I even thought like yeah if anyone if anyone ever yeah if anyone ever like came up to me
3415200	3419200	and was like we should let's have a conversation about pantyhose I would be like it's like
3419200	3425200	saying minecraft like I'd be like okay yeah like you have three hours of my time but
3425200	3433200	that doesn't count after the show I go I go back there I call an uber and I you met a
3433200	3439200	guy once that says like he's he goes at night and takes photos of a certain storefront that
3439200	3445200	has mannequin legs in it right and in New York oh yeah I met a guy at a bar that did
3445200	3450200	that yeah that had a mannequin thing yeah and you guys had it like a good nice like
3450200	3455200	like a very interested like healthy conversation about like like just getting to the bottom
3455200	3464200	of what that is I don't well I guess that's a shame because I don't remember I'm sorry
3464200	3469200	so next question we kind of already talked about a little bit would you get a pantyhose
3470200	3478200	related tattoo no but that says more about my obsession with not getting tattoos I just
3479200	3484200	no I wouldn't because I so a lot of it is rooted in kind of shame and I also felt like
3484200	3488200	like on one hand I feel like that would be healthy to overcome like shame in general like
3488200	3494200	talk okay my therapist says there's good shame like a toddler has shame when they're there
3494200	3499200	if they're if they're at the top of a set of stairs and the parent goes no like like
3499200	3505200	don't and it's like you get so then every time you get near you know big flight of stairs
3505200	3510200	you feel like this jolt of like oh man I don't want my mommy to get mad at me which it's
3510200	3515200	like by falling down stairs and like there's good uses for a shame toxic shame is it benefits
3515200	3520200	nobody and stuff like that so I have a lot of toxic shame about well just in general about
3520200	3525200	everything so I'm trying to figure that out I don't think I'd ever but aside from that
3525200	3531200	I think a tattoo would just ruin everything because a tattoo is like a Superman logo it's
3531200	3538200	like here's my here's my thing and I kind of I I think I think I think the pocket of I think
3538200	3543200	there's a little pocket of shame about it that okay kind of I like the kink I like I like yeah
3543200	3547200	so you wouldn't want like an actual tattoo of pantyhose on your legs so you could always look
3547200	3553200	down and see pantyhose on yourself no I wouldn't want that yeah that seems silly but if somebody
3553200	3558200	came to you and said you must have a tattoo would pantyhose be in the running if just like a you
3558200	3563200	had to have a tattoo yeah sure but so would Pac-Man and okay like I don't know because I would
3563200	3568200	have like there's okay that's very minecraft I guess I'd probably get like a minecraft tattoo okay
3568200	3573200	I have one more question to rate your obsession and this is a weird one it's very it's a strangely
3573200	3579200	metaphysical and you can interpret it how you'd like if you could not enjoy looking at pantyhose
3579200	3586200	without you or someone you love first being punched in the crotch would you still look at pantyhose
3586200	3592200	me or someone I love so I can pick me right all the time or you can pick someone you love which
3592200	3600200	sometimes people in the podcast do they say yeah give it to Steve fuck him I love him I'm
3600200	3608200	sick so sick of loving him I I think there's a I think there's a very real possibility I would
3608200	3613200	never I think if someone else had to get punched in the crotch even a stranger even if even if
3613200	3621200	even if Robert Logia came over magic button and said you get to look at pantyhose every time you
3621200	3625200	hit this button and somewhere someone will get punched in the crotch I don't think I would I
3625200	3629200	would I would I would go okay well obviously this is are you picturing Robert Logia is the
3629200	3635200	enforcer the one who does the crotch punching who is it it's Frank Langella I get him in there to
3635200	3641200	run the button movie okay the I'm sorry is the question every time you look at pantyhose somebody
3641200	3647200	gets punched in the nuts you can you can get a subscription you know you can do it once a month
3647200	3653200	depending on the terms of the subscription if I had to get punched in the nuts yeah in exchange
3653200	3662200	for a year of getting to look at pantyhose have pantyhose be a part of my life visually or
3662200	3669200	whatever yeah I would be like okay yeah so then after you took it for a year and the pantyhose gods
3669200	3674200	came to you and said I'm sorry we need to up it to once a month would you go monthly I thought
3674200	3681200	that'd be I'd start to go what's what's what's going on here isn't there terrorism happening
3681200	3686200	somewhere you don't you don't question the pantyhose gods I know it's so I would start to go then
3686200	3692200	I would start to I think I would start to go well okay I'm this is going you're physically being
3692200	3697200	punished by the gods for what you're doing I would start to actually think about how to kill the
3697200	3704200	gods because I'd be like well this is obviously a call to adventure like because this is wrong to
3704200	3709200	and if I and if I found out I couldn't and I would do it in a very cowardly way like I would find out
3709200	3716200	if there was a way to like steal their force field and put it in a bush at a party I love this is the
3716200	3721200	beginning of your hero's journey but I wouldn't yeah I don't want to well because the thing is like I
3721200	3727200	think I don't want to I don't want damage to yeah yeah I mean that's you want to be able to pain
3727200	3734200	you know right so you take a punch in the arm I would take a heavy punch in the arm okay I would
3734200	3740200	take a punch in the face so you take a punch in the face before you once a month yeah once a month
3740200	3746200	yeah yeah yeah okay hit me as hard as you can what if you had I grew up I grew up in the Midwest
3746200	3751200	of the 70s like I fucking hit me as hard as you can in the face as I as I as I don't lose a tooth
3751200	3757200	like like fucking I get to okay look at pantyhose from what if you had full full unfettered access
3757200	3763200	to pantyhose however you wanted them like just like no like without fear of consequence or
3763200	3770200	repercussion but you lost nipple sensitivity no no no no not worth it no no deal that's what I'm
3770200	3774200	saying no permanent damage I don't want to alter myself in any way right that's why I said I don't
3774200	3779200	even want to lose a tooth necessarily I don't want to ever look at a record but but pain fuck pain
3779200	3783200	see here's great because then I start to figure out the boundaries right of the obsession of tooth loss
3783200	3787200	I don't want to lose myself at all in any way and that was what that was a thing that I was going to
3787200	3792200	talk to you about but I guess we should get to the thing because in compiling my list I noticed a
3792200	3797200	connection and as an obsession as a person obsessed with obsession I was wondering if maybe you
3797200	3802200	would shed some light on the connection it'll take us all out of this we should we'll wrap it up I
3802200	3807200	ask people to make a noise to sum up their obsession can you make a noise to sum up your obsession with
3807200	3829200	pantyhose it's like fewer syllables to say well hello there yeah that's how they gather the
3829200	3837200	oh I didn't I didn't know we got four days for Thanksgiving I don't know I was trying to think of
3837200	3849200	a title for that sound that's great okay it's french fries on the bottom of the bag I think there
3849200	3856200	might be a food component to all of your obsessions that's how I measure fucking worse how many
3856200	3862200	fries are left in my bag calories okay are you do you want me to rate your obsession level with
3862200	3868200	pantyhose I do okay so I use the number seven just for fun and then I always create a thing that
3868200	3874200	seven things you rate things by using numbers for fun the number seven is for fun because
3874200	3878200	sometimes people get obsessed with seven because it's arbitrary or are you saying it's a scale from
3878200	3886200	one to seven yes oh okay exactly all right so I'm gonna say it is seven aunts plain dominoes out of
3886200	3892200	seven aunts plain dominoes I think you are five out of seven aunts plain with dominoes obsessed
3892200	3899200	with pantyhose all right it affects you on a daily basis but you have like clear limitations where
3899200	3905200	like I will not cross this line I'm not yeah I would never yeah I would never involve other I
3905200	3910200	would never take a toll on other people's lives yeah or even mine in a way that I could actually
3910200	3916200	would have to think about for the rest of my life yeah I don't think it's quite worth surgery or
3916200	3921200	permanent injury right or impacting another do you think Dan there's something else on your list
3921200	3928200	that would give you more dominoes ants um I don't know I mean that's a that's a that's a primal sexual
3928200	3933200	kink so I think I'm pretty sure as far as like compulsion like as far as what you could get me to
3933200	3940200	compromise for I mean but that's yeah I mean minecraft how many how many aunts do you think you
3940200	3945200	would score on minecraft obsessions now which I mean minecraft's like cigarettes or something like
3945200	3951200	that where you it's addictive I put that more as an addiction but I am obsessed with minecraft's
3951200	3957200	addictive quads like like like holy shit how can the how can one game be so good and why can't
3957200	3964200	anyone make a better game but but while making that list it was like I was like ants and biology
3964200	3971200	and systems and rules I find myself I think I'm particularly like there's a huge component of my
3971200	3979200	life is in my obsession with story structure and stuff like that is like I don't want to change at
3979200	3989200	all right and I'm obsessed with the idea of simplicity order systems right rules cleanliness
3989200	3997200	in a love-hate way like I'm like I on one hand like refuse to be told what to do and I'm fascinated
3997200	4001200	with anyone that tries to tell anyone what to do it doesn't matter and that's what and I think it
4001200	4006200	trickles down in like my obsession with race and racism and gender politics and social activism
4006200	4011200	and all these things is because I'm always you'll find an equal number of people that like fucking
4011200	4018200	loathe a thing that I say on both sides like I'm a I'm a cuck to the fucking like the whatever
4018200	4024200	yeah and I'm a and I'm a pig headed fucking Belushi to the SJW's I don't use the phrase
4024200	4028200	but I'm like I'm like right in the middle because I'm always going like who's trying to tell me what
4028200	4032200	to feel and yeah and for that matter who's trying to who's trying to tell anybody else what to
4032200	4037200	think and feel and then I'm also like like who says who says a movie is hard to write and who says
4037200	4041200	why can't you wait and it's all it all seems to come down to like this thing where I want to be like
4041200	4047200	this dirty piece of shit like this pile of like organic gunk and I want to like come up with a way
4047200	4054200	of like how can we all be that and like but have it but have it all make sense right so you want to
4054200	4059200	find a little bit of order within the chaos but you would like it if the order it maybe looks like a
4059200	4065200	little bit of crap I want to maybe maybe it maybe it's that I want to prove that the highest order of
4065200	4075200	all necessitates like chaos in in just being organic selfishly want to like create a system in my mind
4075200	4081200	yeah for myself or I want to die like I want I want I want to prove that I don't belong I don't know
4081200	4089200	okay how do coconuts fit in with an obsession with order because coconuts are like so like like I was like
4089200	4097200	they're they are the giant hairy floating nut right so they're like a Lovecraftian food object
4097200	4104200	yeah they should not be they're like it's it's it's like sperm in the form of like this liquid and the
4104200	4110200	inner coating is like egg or it's maybe the other way around it's like a plant it's like there's gametes
4110200	4117200	in the fluid and there's and there's like food stuff like the milky coconut stuff on the inside of the
4117200	4124200	layer that you can scrape it off and eat it like that is delicious to the to that liquid I think as it is
4125200	4131200	this feels more sexual than the patio is to me it is really super sexual and I'm like so it's like biology in
4131200	4140200	general like is so yeah I love like the genetic you know here's something that I just realized I or like that I just
4140200	4147200	realized it's okay to say now in this episode when I was in like ninth grade biology when we were first starting to
4147200	4155200	learn about genetics I would get aroused by the discussions about dominant and recessive genes and stuff
4155200	4161200	like that there was never any there was no sexual component to it it was nowhere near actual reproduction right
4161200	4167200	we were talking about on a cellular level like DNA becoming DNA and all that stuff I get aroused
4167200	4182200	would you would you steal biology bio burglar there's something about was it the recessive gene or the dominant
4182200	4190200	gene or the relationship are you a top or a bottom in the genome situation genes kind of turn me on the idea of genes
4191200	4198200	of the idea of biology the idea that we are we exist as part of some strange goopy mass yeah like like that
4198200	4206200	started as just entropic like molecular collisions and that's something within that is like I want to be
4206200	4215200	I don't know it's not being and that that always takes this aqueous soupy salty briny visceral
4215200	4222200	right I'm like the primordial soup it's exactly what you're saying yeah so it's a system of order that functions that creates
4222200	4234200	scientific reveal that milky good is a computer like make gives me a boner yeah a mind boner right yeah I'm
4234200	4241200	saying like I really did when I was a kid the thing is like when you're that age you're getting boners in geometry too
4241200	4250200	like but I did feel like I like I was especially like titillated by all this talk of like like the teacher would
4250200	4256200	just go around the room and he'd go he'd go like so if you have curly hair and then you and then you reproduce
4256200	4261200	with someone that has straight hair what are the any do like the four quad you know the Gregor Mendel like
4261200	4268200	chart I would find myself like going like curly hair and straight hair getting together and I don't know I just
4268200	4274200	like I can't like I could I was just like the idea of anything like like just just biology just like fucking like
4274200	4279200	like they just like always turn me on right but it's not just random substances getting together it's substance
4279200	4287200	to create order uh yes yes it's not just like I'm gonna take this mustard and I'm gonna mix it with honey
4287200	4292200	and wipe it around you're like that's not interesting no that's weird allianca that can't yeah yeah I know it's
4292200	4297200	exactly you're exactly right it is it it's the it's the biolispid it's what are you called the lipid the lipid
4297200	4303200	biolayer or whatever that's the membranes the science thing yeah it's like all these like descriptions of how
4303200	4311200	this shit works and how it is like like trying to accomplish something but it's like it's like goopy and like
4311200	4322200	yeah yeah so you are obsessed with a primordial ooze that creates structure yeah and pantyhose but that goes
4322200	4327200	like imprisonment and things too you know in pantyhose fetishism there's like a thing called encasement
4328200	4333200	which is like that's people who are so into pantyhose is like nylon that they'll just like encase their whole bodies
4333200	4339200	so there's like sites that are just like it's called encasement as a fetish so it's like head to toe okay like
4339200	4345200	and you can easily do it with basically two pairs of pantyhose or three like you take you take one pair pull it up
4345200	4350200	to midsection another pair you put your arms instead of your legs in and put your head through the crotch and then take
4350200	4357200	a third pair put it on your head now you're encased now I haven't tried it but we had we sounded like an infomercial
4357200	4368200	it's just that five minutes a day it caused less than a cup of coffee sometimes you can just find them in bushes
4368200	4375200	remember when Adam Goldberg's roommate was on the show years ago before we went on the tour yeah Adam Goldberg had a
4375200	4380200	young lady was his roommate she came on it she was she was it sounded like she was a little bit into encasement a little bit
4380200	4385200	she was like like skin tight spandex like it was like anyways but wait I forgot what it's like
4385200	4392200	oh biology reminds me of that it's like this fucking zumanity like fucking like like pushing your like hands against a membrane
4392200	4399200	or something yeah I don't know if it's like I can't figure out if for me it's like it's this idea of like like cocoon
4399200	4409200	or like is it does it have something to do with like like I like I want to airbrush all of humanity I can't tell if I love or hate order
4409200	4417200	yeah that makes sense to me because you want to when you get fascinated with structures of order it's always in some sort of messy sloppy way
4417200	4426200	like at least aesthetically does that make sense yes yes yes because I don't because I'm not an engineer I'm not an architect
4426200	4434200	I'm not I don't I don't I don't go I love systems I'm gonna think about traffic all day yeah I don't I yeah I want I want I'm like I'm
4434200	4441200	interested in human shit like and the fact that when you poop it out it goes into a network of tubes underneath us I want to talk about that or ants
4441200	4448200	which we try to like spray to keep out of our house and the fact that they exist as an older species with a much more systematized thinking and
4449200	4456200	yeah like I yeah that has something to do with the causticity of like most of the shit that we think is a system is bullshit it's like a
4456200	4465200	outgrowth that is actually what we think is order is actually chaos it's a cancerous tumor growing on proper order proper order is God's order
4465200	4475200	which is mud and blood and cum and shit it's organic yeah and beautiful Dan do you think it's possible that there's people listening to this who are no longer listening
4475200	4486200	watch how delicately I shoehorn our ad into this it's possible to be obsessed with Rick and Morty and video games at the same time
4486200	4495200	I think if you I think if you like I think I think Rick and Morty definitely indulge because Rick is like he's a sociopathic
4495200	4504200	anarchistic like crazy genius who definitely doesn't want to be told what to do and yet he's like he able to like make robots and clones
4504200	4513200	and he's able to subvert biology and technology to get whatever he wants done and all he wants is to be left alone and puke green shit out of his mouth
4513200	4519200	and he still drinks out of a flask but there's like definitely an embrace there of like like what is the role of order versus chaos
4519200	4528200	of an exploration you too can now take part in using cryptozoic's new Rick and Morty games that they've come out with
4528200	4537200	there's three games I believe right you tell me I think I have it written down right now I was just told by Dustin just to plug this right now
4537200	4545200	one game is called Total Ricko you can play Mr. Meeseeks box of fun dice and dares game
4545200	4556200	oh oh so I promoted that wrong in the mid-roll recording that I did at one point because I thought there were two things and one of them was called Mr. Meeseeks fun box of dice and fun dares game
4556200	4563200	you might be right I'm only reading what's in this text wait Dustin saying there's two you're right okay all right
4563200	4571200	there was order in the chaos there was order in that chaos so you're Jeff are you saying that there's that this this company that I think is called cryptozoic.com
4571200	4586200	I think yes are you saying that if you go to their site cryptozoic.com slash Harventown that you that there's some that would make you special in some way that you could partake in the purchase of the either this total Rick all game where you play cards and fight
4586200	4598200	I just feel like there might be obsessive people out there who are wondering what their next tattoo and what the thing they should steal next would be and maybe it's a it's a it's a video game
4598200	4610200	these aren't video games these are more tabletop you kind of games are the card games so they're easier to steal actually this is my text is this reminder at some point we have to do an ad for these Rick and Morty video games
4610200	4621200	all we have to do is acknowledge they exist into a bit where we say the name to them which are total Rick all and mr. me six bucks a fund ice and dares game and then use text it back got it
4621200	4650200	it says video games video games that's it Dustin said sorry they're not video games they're not video games the tabletop games you can play with the whole family Rick all game is like a card game that takes advantage everybody remembers the parasite episode where the alien parasites are in the house and they can't tell it's kind of a clip show because they can't tell which of their which of their memories are real and which have been implanted there by mr.
4650200	4673400	poopy butthole episode isn't it he has the card game in the car you knew that I was full of shit when I said video games and then the other thing is it's like it's like a $40 mr. me seeks box that has a functioning button it's 35 bucks for you though if you go to cryptozoic.com slash
4673400	4703240	harmontown and use the promo code harmontown or something like that also me and these okay so back to you Joseph yeah well I so me undies so they're now wait a minute don't bring your integrated marketing into my show how dare you oh wait we're part of the same network yes yeah they're they're very very silky smooth soft twice as soft as cotton yeah I do Dan have you ever felt that we can be honest have you felt me and these
4703240	4733120	did they get into the realm of the sheer pantyhose fetish for me without me feeling all the way like I'm cheating cheating on pantyhose no cheating on like wearing underwear like like I don't like like if I just wore I don't like like like like cheating like like like like oh wait I'm not wearing actual underwear I'm like I have a secret all right which is fine again like I don't let my quest for an identity like trample in your rose garden if you're if you're wearing panties right now and
4733120	4756680	you're like like fantastic like like if it's if I would encourage you to feel better about that I have a shame problem I'm saying like me undies is like so like it's so it's twice a sock do we really have to do it no we don't know I was well this one's on the house honestly no we charge him for this one too they're like they're like when you when you touch them for real yeah they're really soft
4757280	4785760	descriptor it's not hokum and yeah when you put them on on the dude side of the fence the heteronormatively dude side of the fence it does feel it's just this side of the Joe Rogan threshold between self-indulgence and and and transition I have only I have only touched the me undies samples that I got to my face and then I was disturbed by how soft they were
4785760	4814480	like that's too soft your first thing your first instinct was to touch them to your face I like that it was in a public place so it seemed the best way to have assessed the claims of me undies right that they were so incredibly soft what is it can we is there is there is there is there a female in the audience that is like sort of open to and and sort of a just like a coffee just coffee no
4816320	4838840	no like I'm trying to figure out a phrase it just like somebody who who who has an appreciation for it's like finds value in their life for like the kind of the frilliness of traditional female garments oh yeah I don't know how to describe that like somebody that's like that's like oh yeah I'm a I like I like putting on like a like like frilly corsets and like like I yeah like like a like a
4838840	4868680	petticoat lacy business like lingerie type stuff for lower lower like or there's I'm what's that uh I mean no like like undergarments but like when the full frilly fashion like that kind of yeah I guess I guess I guess no yeah thank you for making me clarify because I think I think I'm way more important to hear from somebody who's making it part of their day-to-day life like like you're like you're you're you're you're you're actual like outer wear like like that you're actually like you're wearing it because
4868680	4898680	the question I want to ask is how much of it is for you and how much of it is for other people and I know that's not a difficult quite I know that's a that's a weird question to have to answer and it's not definitive but that's why I just curious about having that is a person saying that willing to just come up and be a character for a second or a person okay hello what's your name hello hello hello so we welcome so into the stage yeah have a seat thank you so much thank you appreciate
4898680	4928680	you because I know especially these are these are times but this is a little bit of a there's a there's a little minefield we could go into here you could not for me honestly like you could end up yeah I mean I guess it's because people tend to like oh she's an ambassador and that's not how we feel and all this stuff so I will stress going forward you're just an individual you're not representing anybody in particular we're hearing from one person so like what do you yeah how the answer the when you hear what I was talking about so like I don't know for me like a big thing is definitely
4928680	4958680	like personal comfortability and I know like everybody dresses I think mostly for themselves I think mostly when people get ready in the morning they dress for themselves and they dress for how they want to feel about themselves contrary to the popular belief that everybody kind of dresses for how they want to be perceived I think some people do but a lot of people dress for like how they want to feel yeah I'm never sure what I'm doing or where you draw that line I mean we're like chimpanzees so we're like what are we doing when we're like clothing ourselves I don't really know that's like I open my closet and I go
4958680	4988680	okay so there are thoughts that go through my head where I'm like that have to do with other people that have to do other people's perceptions right no I think I don't know personally like I definitely got to a time where I was like because I like to dress for other people to the first to a certain extent then I got to a time I was like fuck it you know like I'm a dress for me are we talking about undergarments in particular so like so are you wearing something exotic underneath right now well not on top I have I like made the choice I was like how much of my booms do I want to
4988680	5018680	show today so I wore like a regular bra like a normal person but I have gotten kind of into a thing of like I don't know bralettes have gotten super popular in a bralettes bralettes they're like they're like bras with no support and they're just I know most of the ladies here know them they're mostly like lace or like a really really thin material and they've gotten freakishly popular I'm an advocate already yeah they're great they're great they're mostly like they're they're mostly sheer lace and they've gotten they're so incredibly comfortable
5018680	5048680	you don't have to deal with like the underwire the class of regular bras so they're not giving you the whole lift and separate action they're just there to kind of what just just just to feel good and like keep the nipples in line keep that just kind of yeah yes order in the chaos so to what extent like like so this isn't an easy question either like bras in general like we're we were all born past the time of like well not we weren't all born if you feel that you're out there like this
5048680	5078680	there was this bra burning there was a bra bras specifically we're just focused on for a for a moment in our history is like in feminism is like what the fuck am I wearing these for the idea was like aren't these just making my tits look better for whom and like like fuck you and and that but then from that gets boring it's like well wait a minute like I did when I'm jogging I don't want you know like I and I don't I don't really know anything about that stuff I've never actually asked these questions like like and but like to what the under you said that you're talking about the underwire
5078680	5108680	have like a metal wire underneath them like we know yeah yes yeah but I'm sorry cuz you said these bralettes the difference is like one of the differences lack of support and the word support kind of like in for me needs to be clarified because support could either mean comfort for the individual or cosmetic support yeah so like support so your boobs look perkier is essentially cuz but bra let's have less of that yeah yeah so they're mostly like elastic or
5108680	5138680	like lace or there's no like it's just keeping you from being super nipply underneath whatever right so it's like underwear like kind of like for your boobs yeah like as you would expect yes okay it's all just about the perspective of comfort yeah and they're all a lot of them are like super lacy and like you're supposed to kind of show them off so you'll wear something that's like more see-through or strappier like all right now let's talk about if I can be in delicate let's talk about down like like below the waist like you would you wear like fancy things like garter the garter stockings
5138680	5168680	I like I grew up with like pantyhose or tights that you wear all the way to your waist which are fucking weird yeah I'm not a huge fan of them I definitely like thigh highs and like garters more mm-hmm which are less acceptable are you so like you'd you'd probably wear that did I make the sound like I did like a cousin of the sound because I'm not actually better than nothing four days of Thanksgiving
5168680	5198680	which I would that was disturbing by the way now are you so into Zoe right yes are you so did not into wearing like stockings and thigh highs and garter belts and things like that that you would wear them under jeans or only when you were in like a dress or something like that dresses and skirts mostly just because they're like hard to maneuver under jeans yeah yeah so so yeah dresses and skirts mostly gotcha but when you're wearing that that's more visible that's that's that's partly for you and partly for the public
5198680	5228680	that's where it kind of gets sketchy because I like to wear them for me like I'm more comfortable like I like them I think they're fun I feel more comfortable in them and I don't like to have them if I know they're gonna show see right now I'm only wearing underwear made completely of squirrels easy Joseph no easy Joseph he's reacting to your squirrel underwear like a squirrel
5228680	5258680	would react to to my nuts another reason to get the get a subscription to the streaming service again not an easy question to answer and again Zoe is not up here representing anybody so like like she's like like she's gonna answer personally when as far as outward and and for those audio only Zoe's not she said she's unmistakably feminine
5258680	5288680	she's wearing jeans and and a sweater and she's she's like this question could we have no idea we have a neutral I think person like when you're when you're getting dressed in the morning like are you like like like do you have any idea like like like how first of all the first question is how much is it for other people how much is it for you and then the second question is how much of those other people are are are are men if
5288680	5318680	you're heterosexual or yeah like like like well like like then then we need a different term like how many of those other people are yeah okay yeah whatever the work for that is because I'm 43 so I'm like potential suitors many different colors
5318680	5348680	in Austin but but yeah so you got so answer that in any order any manner and feel free to have your answer be a mess and just it's you individually will probably be a mess okay so like for me I will go to sleep by myself at night and I will wear lingerie just because I like it it's like it's 98% for me I would say mm-hmm I would say like I got to a point my sorry babe my boyfriend isn't particularly into
5348680	5378680	stuff so it's definitely all for me like it got to a point where I was like all right fuck you all this is something you would do by yourself though like if you weren't in dating you wear lingerie to bed yeah fuck yeah and it's partially aesthetic right it's not just the comfort it's just like I like the design I like the way it's fun it's comfortable like depending on what you buy or what you wear but like yeah I feel I can't tell if this is like in like 1993 this was like a fun cute thing for a guy to say but now I don't know if it's just one of those pigheaded perpetuation things to say but I feel like I
5378680	5408680	think if I were a woman I would I would I would like a big part of like what I wore to bed would be like how I looked but I don't know now like I would just but yeah but that's I don't know what even where that gets filed anymore I'm like I feel like I would wear like Garfield like t-shirts but I would make but I would like pick them that I would want them to fit right so that I would like so that I'd look like I'd want to look like Joe
5408680	5438680	I feel like I'd like roll around in the bed a little bit and then like like you know but and then and then go to bed it wouldn't have to do with like sexuality but it would have to do with aesthetics and that would add to my comfort or something like it depends right like not every night I'm gonna like throw on a corset and some thigh-highs I'm mostly gonna be in something that's more comfortable nothing's like sleeping in a corset yeah it's the best especially if you're going for those like full bone corsets it's very comfortable you were the actual straight-up whale bone I don't know but I definitely have friends that that have like done the full like
5438680	5468680	bone corsets that are gonna break your ribs a few yeah but my head gets flushed with all of these crazy like questions because the other thing also is like it's not a straight gender dichotomy either even if there was one there because then part of the swirling irony of the gender dichotomy would be oh the there's like an indoctrination of the whole visual thing and it's like the big thing would be like okay if you were a dude that was ripped if I was Vin Diesel like do I do I then wear a dude equivalent of a Garfield shirt like that goes to mid thigh
5468680	5498680	like what does he wear to bed and is it all for comfort or is it all it does he go like you know like the way I looked and it helps me dream better I mean what do you wear to bed like I just I try to sleep as little as possible because it's I worry that someone will take control of my life while I'm off guard I five depending on the depending on who I'm with I may have
5498680	5528680	pants are on my ankles with a laptop on my lap that's so funny that I was just reading I'm reading Augustus by John Williams and it's about Caesar Augustus Octavius and he said the same thing like he didn't sleep that much because he didn't like the idea that like that he's wasting that part of his life like like other people are gonna be doing stuff while I'm like I try as hard as I can not to sleep and I like I get away with it like I sleep very little but underwear underwear and like sometimes
5528680	5558680	like I feel like I like I like I like fuck these underwear that I'm like I'm naked like I'm a little baby in those sheets like I'm a little naked baby Spencer are you a naked sleeper lingerie sleeper what do you I'm a lingerie sleeper do you care for the frilly garments online on your lady or do you care about no I don't care about anything Spencer's in a bed
5558680	5588680	place I think he's the worst because we can't see him at a table what since we stopped playing D&D what's the point of him having a table by the way why doesn't he just sit up here like like I could flip it if I get mad all right he was he was in a he was in a he's he seemed a little sleepy and like I don't want to say anything that's a value judgment on it yeah it's like you were sleepy you said you were sleepy in the in the green oh I said it
5588680	5618680	he's gonna flip this table we have to put more interesting things on the table so when you flip it there's like a debris field it's definitely one of those nature there's nice where I forget about Spencer and that's why he doesn't get to say a lot in the show and then there's tonight I was like I was like I think Spencer needs some space emotionally like cuz I feel like they're mostly it's just like I don't have anything to contribute like for instance I don't care about pantyhose and I don't care about lingerie so what am I gonna how do you what do you come in on coconuts I mean exactly
5618680	5648680	they're the most mundane thing on the planet I'd never thought twice about a coconut they could fucking kill you bro yeah they can't look up look up coconut deaths right here in Hollywood you know that more more people die of coconut deaths than Isis than Isis yeah and 58% of all Isis deaths are coconut related yeah yeah that's what they don't want you to
5648680	5678680	know it big coconut all right Zoe but so okay so sometimes you so so so you you you will sleep in something that is not necessarily designed for functional comfort but there's a there's a blurring of the line where it's like I look good and I that makes me feel good and that like I want to wear that to bed and it's not even like self-sexual it's not like you're like masturbating like because you're like oh I look so good in this laundry I'm gonna masturbate
5678680	5708680	it's just like it's just like I feel I feel I feel comfortable because I feel feminine I feel and so it's a that right there answers like a big part of my question which is like like because if you were in the in the morning then if you were picking your outfit and you were to wear something that had an alluring like vibe to it a tactile
5708680	5738680	you're more maybe like a little more closer to how I am like I like dressing up I like the feeling of putting a suit on I like the action of tying a tie like I like also it was lingerie there's a lot of the fun's gotta be
5738680	5768680	harder like like to a stocking right right that's that's just like that that feels right I mean honestly in the mornings like I will like shower put my undergarments on and then take my hour to get ready before I get dressed like it's something where it's like it's fun for me to to dress up even if it's underneath what I'm wearing and like I know what I'm wearing throughout the day even if other people don't like it's really not about them right you know I love picking up stuff from the dry cleaners just walking out with a bunch of new shit ready to rock and then you see it and it's in the
5768680	5798680	closet and there's a bag on it and you take it out of the bag and I want to put this fucking suit on have you ever stolen someone else's suit if I found anybody my size I fucking would I mean I used to steal clothes a long time ago but that was back when I was just a shoplifter and I didn't have any style at all like I didn't even know what my style would have been but I don't I don't think I'm a thief anymore but let's
5798680	5828680	just say I went into somebody's like like if I like if I woke up like Ali Baba Bunny when Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck tunnel up into like Aladdin's like treasure wrong turn it out exactly like for me it wouldn't be gold in the piles of jewels it would just be like a bunch of Vivian Westwood suits everywhere and then I would steal everything I would I I have dreamed I obsessed like my mind my general dream at night is a mild anxiety dream about what am I gonna pack
5828680	5858680	what clothes do I have like what am I bringing like it's like I'm a little late for the trip for the plane of the train of the tour bus or whatever and it's like oh no I don't have the tie clips with a fuck of the tight clips of like it's it's a mild anxiety that permeates like almost like half of my dream state and it's all sartorial it's all just clothing shit so do you guys so Zoe let's draw a line between Zoe slash Jeff and me slash Spencer who I I lay in bed in whatever I was wearing when I
5858680	5888680	fell into bed and when Spencer texts me it means I'm five minutes late for work and I have five minutes to get ready so I can only be 15 minutes late for work and like that and I and I that like I almost like create scenarios where I can't I taking a shower and caring about what I wear is off the table I almost I almost I wonder like oh no for me it's obsession like I said five alarmists I've got all that time to get that I wonder I wonder if I'm doing that because well here's what
5888680	5918680	I'm wondering I'm wondering if the difference between people who take pleasure in caring about their clothes and people who don't is a matter of experience like it's like well if you tried it you'd love it if you could just
5918680	5948680	you know like like we just crave but but now it's 2016 and it's like okay open pool table and fucking Donald Trump's running for president so let's all just figure out who we are and in light of that like like like so like is it is the is closed people like if I got a taste of what it felt like to care about clothes would it would I get slowly sucked no it's not part of your essence it's not really so either it never has been it never would be married I cared about clothes a lot that day and I kind of like I suffered through every minute of it you know it's
5948680	5978680	it's like shit it's always gonna be for me it's like going to church or something like like okay and then I got to put this on and I can look in the mirror at the end of they go oh yeah I guess I can see how people would prefer that and that's also why it took three hours instead of 20 minutes and I yeah and I kind of I don't know like for me like at the end of the day like I said before it's just kind of like fuck them like it's it's what what's up to you I definitely don't think that like I got I don't know it's like you like putting on suits for you yeah right you like how you look into this feels like
5978680	6008680	pajamas to me and pajamas are like little suits they got little lapels they got pajamas got pockets where am I gonna put in that pocket do you have I got pajamas with it with the suits like I'm not gonna put I'm not gonna put anything in there I'm not putting business cards in my pajamas that's why I feel see if I love pajamas I went through a phase when I was working in community I had a little bit of a nervous breakdown and I started just coming to work in my pajamas I think I was just trying to get fired cuz I was just like well if you guys are telling me to stop caring about the show I'll just come in my pajamas and that'll
6008680	6038680	look like I'm relaxed while I'm fucking trying to edit the show right and so I was just like wearing pajamas they're like you wearing pajamas I'm like yeah I'm a pajampian like I I coined the phrase and I got fired just for that play on words I know I think also because I was insane like the idea of comfort like like like if it was like like if it was like oh these are silk or like like if everyone just wore pajamas I
6038680	6068680	know like like I could see there's a there's a Venn diagram where all of us are like going like like oh yeah that's great I love those Vivian Westwood pajamas because when you when you go like this they're more they don't rip or and they and they also feel good when you're sleeping but they look good across a room I was like I like when I was in London doing some shows I got there was a Vivian Westwood store and thank God there was like a sale going on because it's really expensive and there was these great tall like rail thin gay guys that
6068680	6098680	work there and they're just wearing outfits I couldn't ever wear because they're way too flashy but they look awesome in it and like going in there and trying stuff on and like that's me being the girl wants like like like that's my squirrel
6098680	6128680	yeah shit it's on I'm gonna put a suit on it's gonna be really good yeah but you know like then I got this awesome suit that I love and I came out of the thing and I was like no way to find a tie for it and they're giving me this really flashy ties it's not my thing and I was like I was the only guy in the store and it's all these you know these great London you know like like sales clerks in a sexy store in Savile Row and and it's really flashy ties and so I pick out like the like one I liked and the guys like I go what do you think about this he goes
6128680	6158680	it's okay if you are in fifth grade like this French guys like I was like hey man like like I can't but we can't all dress like you like I have to keep it a little more square than that to me that then you leave with a big-ass bag and you feel like Julia Roberts and pretty woman it's good right I had a I had a breakthrough with a guy I'd like I think it was literally like oh it's something it was in New York and I had to do it some kind of show and I was like I had to run out to one of those I don't know
6158680	6188680	or like you had a buyer like a shopper like a personal yeah like or there was a guy that like like it was a there was a guy that worked at the place and it was like he was like getting frustrated with me because it's like what do you want this and that Dan real quick like he got what I would love to have is somebody that takes you out and as a personal shopper and you go out and they pull stuff for you and you try stuff on they take you from store to store thinking of a different thing though that was a disaster yeah there was an emergency where I was like I needed like a new I wanted a new like I wanted to get like a jacket
6188680	6218680	or something and for a thing and and I remember the guy getting frustrated cuz it's like he worked in clothing and he there was this barrier there where it was like I need a new jacket and I want to look good but he like it's like when yet when it's same thing when I go to a haircut place it's like well I don't I'm not in the business of talking or thinking about my hair but I'm here for a haircut so what are we gonna do about this and so there's frustration on both sides and then there's a syndrome there of snuff like like you feel as a consumer if you
6218680	6248680	don't care about your hair or clothes you get you feel you feel bullied you feel snobbified like like you're like oh this person like knows more about hair and clothes and they're judging me but I think it's just like they just want to know and I just blurted to the guy at one point I said look I want to I want I want clothes that no matter where I went in time and space people would ignore me they would they would not be able to tell if I was rich or poor or clean or dirty
6248680	6278680	or from the past or from the future or high status or low status they would leave me alone and he was like oh and he took me over to a fucking gray jacket and he was like oh you want to be a fucking generic time traveler that's great like yeah I would love a clothing store that was just called what are we gonna do about this that totally embrace like I know I want to
6278680	6308680	do something different but I just yeah like you can just come in weeping and like it's okay we'll help or just a place where like you know like there's like wine clothes hair there's got to be like five other things in this category where it's like every once in a while you run into a person that somehow strikes upon a vibe with you that where you don't feel intimidated and in that moment you learn a thousand things like I've eaten in a restaurant where I was like I just had the fucking balls or
6308680	6338680	whatever stupidity or highness to go like look I don't know anything about wine can you tell me what the fuck this is all about and and I've done that before and had the person go like tell you all about it and all right knock it off I'll take the hash browns fuck off but but but then like I but there are those moments where you intersect with somebody who's like who's like oh you want to you want to me to teach you about wine from the beginning right yeah she treat me like a person that wandered off a rocket ship and and doesn't know what a glass is and go
6338680	6368680	from there and sometimes you get like you get like you'll sometimes you're gonna hairstylist like that and sometimes you'll get a person that's like picking your is helping you find a shirt like that and then and you kind of like I don't know if you like like I walk away from those experiences going like oh my god humanity has a chance because I still don't care about jackets but I don't I no longer there's this whole world where I thought I thought it had everything to do with you you're either smarter stupid or you're hurting someone or victim and it's actually actually just people who care about jackets
6368680	6398680	and people who don't and I met a person today who is in the right mood and we talked like we've made a friendship and I have knowledge and I'll share some with you it's not a judgment whether you have it or I don't it's just right hey yeah I think there would be a huge market for like well you know look how big those that series of books blank for dummies it's like yeah it's like like like take that principle and just go like and then like like this is a closed store where what are we gonna do about this I guess I just took 10 minutes to repeat what you're what you're
6398680	6428680	pitch was yeah like you're like like a place where you felt comfortable walking in and going I don't know man yeah come on help Zoey help me when you're a little girl like did you always like know what you wanted to wear what like what were you what like what you were gonna wear to school or out when yeah I was I was a little bit out of it growing up so I did I had like my my phases but every phase I knew exactly what I wanted to wear and like how I wanted to look and how how I felt comfortable actually I'm on them drive up here today
6428680	6458680	from orange and we had a conversation about my hair because I've your hair is badass by the way thank you we had a conversation because I want to nestle inside of your hair you know what after all give you the opportunity all right Joseph and I're gonna get into like a squirrel it is like a nest it is it's it's like a nest so we'll take that time but about how I went through like a large period of time where I was like just red hair and I was
6458680	6488680	like like fire engine bright red hair and I was like this is me and I like attached myself to that and that was like what I was just most comfortable with and like how like I knew that that was me and that was like a mistake and I definitely I had another two years where I still had the bright red hair but I also had a mohawk and so it was like but I was like this is fucking me like I'm do you have any idea why what you know what what signal you got that that made you go on the
6488680	6518680	red kick um no it was I have I I do know that one day I just heard redhead and now he's going on us you know what I heard was like a common cry of somebody who's just like I have a history of like I would just pick random shit as I was growing up but I was like well I gotta have something I had I straight up had like a mohawk and like you guys see I have real curly hair and so I just buzzed the sides of my head and just had like a weird ass curly mohawk for two years and it happened because my friend one day was like I'd like to shave my head and I was like that's a good idea
6518680	6548680	I went home and I was like hey mom break out the clippers and she was like alright let's do it and so I how tall was the mohawk I mean it grew like my hair was about this at its height like how big was how high was the mohawk off your head well it got to a point where I couldn't wear it like straight up anymore because I wasn't like gelling it up I was just letting it do whatever so I would braid it back I got you so just be like one braid down the center of my head yeah very very odd it never got like super high and when it got I had I had bangs too so it was like a pompadour
6548680	6578680	above the mohawk yeah whatever you're thinking that's what it looked like so then this all leads inexorably to like like did you have an epiphany at any point of like where you were you pursuing things the wrong way when you were going from this to this to this to this like Don Cheadle in Boogie Nights he's like I'm a cowboy I'm a robot I'm a this he had to find his look or did you or is that or are we seeing you are we seeing you in another phase or did you have
6578680	6608680	a did you have like a Zion that you came home to um I don't know um like I really don't because I I think I definitely like my motto through high school is like when I'm 80 I just want to look back and be like yeah I did that shit like like every single thing would you like to see like oh would you like to see yourself change because a lot of people I want a montage of just all my bad hair choices oh there you go yeah because that's that's the thing that happens to all of us anyway and like it's better to embrace that too many people from my generation are like oh these embarrassing like
6608680	6638680	oh the things this was in back then I look like the Ramones and all this stuff and it's like well yeah but you didn't know I mean like and also like what what is your hair it doesn't matter right yeah so it's good it's like you're just like I want those coffee mugs from every gift shop that is like every three years so I definitely like right now it's just kind of like doing my thing this is what it's appropriate I'm like a new adult so I'm going into like this is what will get me okay in life without me like getting in trouble for my bosses and
6638680	6668680	I'm sure I've been kind of talking about reverting back to like the bright hair so I have a bottle of pink dye in my in my bathroom right now that when you make a change do you know is there is there a signal are you is it does it come from inside or does it come from outside do you see something like a billboard or something and go like yeah most of the time I'm like scrolling through Instagram and I'm like that's pretty cool and I'll just like like that's how the pink bottle of dye in my closet as I saw like a black afro or a black girl with an app with a pink afro and I was like oh that's mine that's mine next so that's so just do right now is you kind of walk in the line of being respected
6668680	6698680	but still a little funky yeah like like it was my hair's dark naturally and so it was dark I bleached my hair to put in the pink dye and then I was like no I dig it let's let's keep it for a while so like it really there's never an opportunity for that or there's never a point where I change and it's like really planned it's just kind of like whatever to make it pink you have to get it way way more light than that yeah yeah so you just got to bleach the hell out of it yeah yeah it's gonna be a process do you feel like it affects what you do like if you went pink and it was a little bit more shocking do you feel
6698680	6728680	like I would maybe do some things with pink hair that I didn't when I was not pink hair I mean I think maybe with some I'm just honestly I'm just kind of fucking crazy so like I'll do I'll do whatever anyways okay so yeah I mean I don't think would you talk to Hitler about pink hair you know what I might be like dude if you embraced yourself a little bit more maybe dine your hair pink just the mustache just a good choice you might be a little happier what would Hitler
6728680	6758680	have done differently with a pink mustache like everybody I mean people probably would have laughed at him a little bit I laughed at him a little bit oh you don't want that thank you for bringing that up we're gonna wrap up the show I'd like to wrap it up with this thought because people keep comparing Donald Trump to Hitler and then other people keep going he's nothing like Hitler don't do that I just would like to say as a closing thought I think the idea of comparing a politician to Hitler is to get a fucking jump on it
6758680	6788680	as early as possible I see no fucking punishment for doing it prematurely I think that's a good gun to jump I don't think Hitler he wasn't like during the primaries going let's kill 500,000 Jews he didn't like ramp it up he fucking got elected and then the shit storm sharted because it was I don't know what that weird speech the size of started he thrust he thrust his fish against the speech and pediment and then
6788680	6818680	each is dick look fascism is an opportunistic infection in a country that's been destabilized economically and culturally like like like the the the clowns that rise up that get everybody's angry attention they typically have funny hair and silly mannerisms they're rodeo clowns they're there it's not it's so so it's good to good yes he's Hitler he is exactly Hitler he's precisely Hitler
