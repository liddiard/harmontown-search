0	15000	From the Melville Theater in San Diego, Comic-Con 2015, hide it down.
15000	20000	It's now in second.
20000	27000	The Frank Spencer Credenton out to the stage.
27000	31000	There he is.
31000	41000	And emerging from the fiasco of Kukui, the mayor of Harbin Town, Dan Harbin.
41000	45000	Hello Comic-Con, hello San Diego. Thank you so much.
45000	49000	God, I've been hydrating for you all day.
49000	52000	I got so drunk yesterday and I made up my mind.
52000	56000	We're not doing a bad show for San Diego. Thank you guys for coming out.
56000	61000	We're in competition with Star Wars, Star Trek, Muppet movies, whatever.
61000	68000	Every major corporation that has anything to sell is selling it tonight at Nerd Dance, Nerd Can.
68000	72000	This is the pop cultural epicenter of the year and of the country.
72000	81000	And these are the, looks like 500 people or so that really loved us above all else.
82000	85000	And we owe them an amazing show.
85000	92000	I will not leave this stage until each of you feels like you've got $30 worth of entertainment.
92000	98000	And that's not fucking around. I'm going to do whatever I have to do for you.
98000	104000	But that also means I have to guard and protect you against abuses of your time.
104000	110000	But Dan, we have nothing for sale here except entertainment.
110000	112000	They didn't buy that at all.
112000	116000	So we all just came from the same yacht. I think that's the most important thing.
116000	117000	Let's talk about the yachts.
117000	121000	Actually, you know what? We can wait for that until our guest comes out because I don't want her to have to wait too long.
121000	122000	Right.
122000	125000	I'll talk about things that our guest wasn't there for.
125000	131000	Like the fact that I got my testicles checked because I felt like I felt like a small something.
131000	135000	And I was like, whatever. It's like in the tissues, but not the...
135000	137000	Was it right above your balls?
137000	139000	No, that's my penis.
140000	145000	I felt something under the underside, but I was like, I don't know.
145000	147000	It's something that's like life is going too good.
147000	150000	Like I'm very happy and very much in love and I'm working on things that I love.
150000	153000	And so, of course, I had to feel around until I found something.
153000	154000	Right.
154000	157000	And so it made me think like I got to go to the doctor.
157000	158000	So I went to the doctor.
158000	162000	And it's weird when you're...
162000	164000	My doctor's like a bro.
164000	167000	Like he makes jokes. He does bits.
168000	170000	And so then when he's like, so what's going on?
170000	172000	And I was like, I think maybe a lump.
172000	173000	And he's like, in your butt?
173000	174000	In your balls?
174000	176000	Sorry, I didn't say in your butt.
178000	180000	You guys are making me nervous.
180000	181000	And I said, in your balls?
181000	183000	And then he felt the balls.
183000	185000	And so he's feeling my balls.
185000	186000	He's like a guy.
186000	188000	He's like a scrubs character.
188000	192000	He's just like a Zach Braffian kind of like he's just a bro.
192000	193000	And so he's feeling my balls.
193000	195000	But I felt...
195000	196000	I didn't realize...
196000	197000	I touched my nipple.
198000	200000	I reached up and I was like...
200000	201000	I caught myself.
202000	204000	He was just feeling my balls around and I went...
205000	208000	I reached up and I touched my nipple.
208000	209000	Because as a reflex.
209000	210000	I don't know.
210000	211000	And Cody had told me before.
211000	214000	She said like, you touched your nipple when...
214000	215000	What? God damn it.
215000	216000	Now I forgot.
216000	219000	I want to hold your dick while you pee.
219000	220000	Okay, okay.
220000	221000	Sorry.
222000	225000	Why is she off stage for that line?
225000	226000	Because she's not...
226000	227000	This isn't check off.
227000	229000	She should be on stage for the action.
229000	231000	I leave that up to her.
231000	233000	She's not a performer.
233000	235000	She doesn't like the spotlight unless it's unconditional.
235000	237000	But she wants to hold your dick while you pee.
237000	239000	Well, yeah, but she wanted to remind me of the story.
239000	240000	We were at a hotel and she was like,
240000	241000	I want to hold your dick when you pee.
241000	243000	A lot of people will testify to this.
243000	245000	This is the kind of stuff that's not politically correct,
245000	247000	but it's like it's something that people do.
247000	249000	It sounds romantic as hell.
249000	251000	Can I aim your wiener while you pee?
251000	255000	And she told me that I was touching my nipple
255000	256000	while she was doing it.
256000	257000	I was like, no, I wasn't,
257000	258000	because there's nothing really sexual about it.
258000	259000	It was just a favor for a friend.
259000	261000	Like, there you go.
261000	263000	It's like coming to the firehouse and you go like,
263000	264000	don't play with matches.
264000	266000	I mean, okay, here's what a hose is like.
266000	268000	And like, you know...
268000	270000	She said, you touched your nipple.
270000	271000	I was like, no, I didn't,
271000	272000	because I wasn't...
272000	274000	But then the doctor was like checking my testicles
274000	276000	and I was like playing with my nipple.
276000	277000	Right.
278000	281000	So what I'm saying is we're all the same.
283000	286000	I think what you're saying is we're all a little different.
289000	291000	So we're all the same.
291000	293000	Now, is it always the same nipple
293000	295000	when she was holding your wiener and he was checking your balls?
295000	297000	Is it left hand to left nipple?
297000	298000	I don't know.
298000	300000	I mean, I don't know what I did when she was helping me pee,
300000	302000	but I remember this because I remember the sensation of me going like,
302000	303000	what am I doing?
303000	306000	Because I was like shifting them around for him.
306000	309000	I was like on the bottom side and then I was like, neat.
309000	312000	Do you think it's more of a comfort thing than a sexual thing
312000	314000	or are those two things related?
314000	317000	Well, I think that things that give you comfort...
317000	319000	Anything that gives you comfort is a potential addiction
319000	322000	and addiction is like your neurology growing around something.
322000	323000	So as my therapist says,
323000	325000	if you have your first drink when you're 12 years old,
325000	327000	like the experience you have is,
327000	330000	oh my God, I had a cup of this stuff and I had a great night.
330000	333000	So it's not the same when you do it when you're 16.
333000	334000	And it's not the same when you do it when you're 32
334000	338000	because your neurology like develops a relationship around the process.
338000	341000	So you have no idea at any given time
341000	343000	if you think you're doing what you want to do.
343000	346000	It might be something that your brain thinks you want to do
346000	352000	because wanting to want to do it makes you want to feel wanna, wanna, wanna.
352000	354000	Like it does it, it might just be garbage.
354000	355000	And then you have to combine that with,
355000	359000	gee, I wonder if we're vulnerable to an oligarchy,
359000	361000	hypnotizing us on a mass scale,
361000	365000	indoctrinating our values to a left and right margin.
365000	371000	Do you think Dr. Braff, your doctor,
371000	374000	do you think somebody whose job is to put fingers in that many butts
374000	377000	and touch that many balls for lumps and for serious reasons
377000	379000	sees a certain range of behavior,
379000	381000	like a lot of nipple touching or a lot of,
381000	384000	I don't know, man, like neck scratching.
384000	386000	He seems like the kind of guy that would definitely,
386000	389000	if he had seen, if he thought there was a joke to be had,
389000	390000	he would have made it.
390000	392000	Like, this is a guy who like, he does bits.
392000	395000	He's like a funny Beverly Hills doctor.
395000	397000	He's a bro.
397000	398000	He's a bro.
398000	400000	Don't we go to the same doctor?
400000	401000	No, same office.
401000	403000	Same office, but you got some classic.
403000	406000	Yeah, my guy thinks he's funny, but he's really not funny.
406000	408000	That's every doctor.
408000	411000	Like, I'm sorry if you're a doctor, like you think you're funny,
411000	413000	but people are terrified.
413000	416000	Like, they are chuckling nervously.
416000	420000	Like, they're like, it's weird.
420000	422000	If you're a doctor and you think you're funny,
422000	425000	you need to think again because you work all day
425000	428000	with people who have been like basically waterboarded.
428000	432000	I haven't had a full like medical like blood test, the whole thing.
432000	433000	I said, give me the works.
433000	435000	I want to know if I'm dying, living forever.
435000	437000	Like, I want to know everything about me.
437000	439000	And he gave me the whole stuff and he called me up
439000	440000	and he was like, okay, this is good.
440000	441000	This is great.
441000	442000	He goes, your liver kidneys are fine.
442000	443000	I'm like, what?
443000	445000	I couldn't believe that, by the way.
445000	446000	I never can.
446000	447000	He keeps telling me my liver's great.
447000	449000	And I'm like, if you say so.
449000	452000	Maybe his liver scanner is off.
452000	454000	Maybe the thump it.
454000	456000	But he goes, you, I don't know.
456000	459000	There's one thing, there's kind of an anomaly, Jeff here.
459000	462000	There's a little bit of like density in your red blood cells.
462000	465000	Maybe you need to get a little more folic acid, B vitamins in your diet.
465000	467000	I said, well, I am vegetarian.
467000	469000	And he goes, I thought you were a Libra.
469000	471000	And I paused.
471000	474000	I paused on the phone for as long as I could.
475000	477000	Eight seconds.
477000	478000	And I said, I'm sorry.
478000	480000	I was just putting that on your chart.
483000	484000	So that's the thing.
484000	485000	Okay.
485000	486000	I want to, by the way, Spencer, how are you?
486000	487000	Oh, I'm great.
487000	488000	Yeah.
493000	495000	It's, it's a, yeah, this is great.
495000	497000	I just sit here and I get applause.
498000	499000	It's amazing.
499000	502000	I was kicking up the street and walking up the road from down by the,
502000	505000	the, the, uh, the marina up to the theater here at the Balboa.
505000	509000	And I just walked by Spencer and he's like, Hey man, how's it going?
509000	512000	Something made so much sense about just walking by Spencer at Comic Con.
512000	513000	It felt so good.
513000	517000	Well, yes and no, because Spencer doesn't dig crowds and like people says this
517000	520000	simultaneously, this is definitely,
520000	525000	this is the place where you'd be most like regarded and simultaneously
525000	528000	probably most possibly unhappy.
528000	529000	Oh yeah.
529000	530000	Both of those things.
531000	532000	No, it's great.
532000	533000	People, people say hi.
533000	535000	They're just like, Oh, the Spencer.
535000	537000	And I'm like, Oh, you.
537000	541000	Except, except you fucking bolted back to that yacht when those game of thrones
541000	542000	people showed up.
542000	543000	Oh no.
543000	546000	I, I was on a very specific and private Aaron.
546000	547000	It was great.
547000	548000	Getting, getting weed.
548000	549000	Oh no.
549000	551000	That was the public part of the air.
551000	554000	Dan, uh, yacht spoilers.
554000	555000	Yeah.
555000	556000	Really?
556000	557000	Come on.
557000	558000	No, no, no.
558000	559000	Well, I was typing about it that we came from,
559000	561000	but why don't we bring out our guest?
561000	563000	Uh, she plays summer on Rick and Morty.
563000	565000	Uh, Spencer Grammer's here.
579000	580000	Hi.
583000	584000	Yeah.
584000	585000	Hello, Spencer.
585000	586000	Hello.
586000	587000	Oh God.
587000	590000	We have a, we have a surfer to Spencer's up here.
590000	591000	We're being super.
591000	593000	I didn't realize that they were talking about you.
593000	594000	Yeah.
594000	595000	Yeah.
595000	596000	Sorry.
596000	597000	Spencer on the way over.
597000	598000	And it's like that at the office.
598000	600000	They're like, Oh, Spencer's coming.
600000	602000	And I'm like, I haven't heard about this at all.
602000	603000	It's weird.
603000	605000	Spencer has to record and Spencer to this.
605000	606000	Yeah.
606000	609000	Can I show like, I'll go by Carl tonight.
609000	611000	I'll be Carl.
611000	613000	Okay.
613000	614000	It'll work.
614000	615000	It's a good name.
615000	616000	No, no.
616000	617000	I don't know.
617000	619000	That's, I think it's a worst name.
619000	620000	Sorry.
620000	621000	Carl's the worst name.
621000	622000	There's probably Carl's out there.
622000	623000	I hope so.
623000	625000	Do you have a middle name, Spencer?
625000	626000	Oh yeah.
626000	627000	What?
627000	628000	Karen.
629000	630000	Carl.
632000	635000	Both of our middle names start with the sound.
635000	636000	Yeah.
636000	638000	Oh, my middle name is not actually Carl.
638000	640000	I just feel it's, it's worse than Carl,
640000	642000	which I've called a terrible name.
642000	645000	So I'll lose if I reveal it.
646000	647000	What's your middle name?
647000	648000	We can all look it up.
648000	649000	Yeah.
649000	650000	No, look it up.
650000	651000	You and IMDB.
651000	652000	IMDB Pro.
652000	656000	I'm going through the script templates on Final Draft.
656000	657000	Did you write a script for me?
657000	660000	Where the fuck is the community in Rick and Morty?
660000	662000	Open from, come on.
664000	665000	Oh.
665000	667000	What's your middle, what's your middle name?
667000	668000	Spencer.
668000	669000	Okay.
669000	670000	Mine.
670000	671000	Yeah.
671000	672000	Karen.
672000	673000	Karen.
673000	674000	Yeah.
674000	675000	Spencer.
675000	676000	I don't know how.
676000	677000	See what spell it.
677000	678000	C.
678000	679000	Q.
679000	680000	C-H.
680000	681000	Karen.
681000	682000	It's a different show.
682000	683000	I'm sorry, you guys.
683000	684000	I'm not even.
684000	685000	What are you doing?
685000	686000	I'm sorry.
686000	687000	There's a podcast.
687000	688000	We're literally just talking about middle names.
688000	689000	Are you opening up old drafts of scripts?
689000	690000	What's going on?
690000	691000	It's like looking through.
691000	692000	This is Steve Levy's laptop.
692000	693000	So I won't dig too hard.
693000	694000	Let's go through Steve Levy's shit right now.
694000	695000	Let's see.
695000	696000	We have an opportunity.
696000	697000	What's it looked at?
697000	698000	Let's see his photos.
698000	699000	Oh, shit.
699000	700000	Find some.
700000	701000	All right.
701000	702000	Go to his messages.
702000	703000	Those look like nice people.
703000	704000	That was his fraternity.
704000	705000	Sigma Pi.
705000	706000	Aww.
706000	707000	Okay.

727000	728000	Find a folder.
728000	729000	Oh, was that me?
729000	730000	Go back.
731000	733000	I'm a hun-gab like un-gab.
736000	737000	Me too.
737000	738000	Wait.
738000	739000	Check out those emojis.
739000	740000	That might tell us something.
740000	741000	Okay.
741000	742000	We got Black Santa.
742000	743000	These recently used emojis.
743000	745000	The Black Santa is a popular one.
745000	746000	It's a photo.
746000	747000	I got to say.
747000	748000	And a photo.
748000	749000	I know it's a photo, Dan.
749000	752000	Well, what do you want me to go to those emojis?
752000	753000	They're already there.
753000	755000	These are the recently used emojis.
755000	757000	They tell you his story.
757000	759000	No one's asking you to click on it.
759000	760000	Oh, okay.
760000	762000	We're looking to glean information about Steve Levy.
762000	764000	Why is the snowman the first one?
764000	765000	That's what I want to know.
765000	767000	What color monster?
767000	768000	This one.
768000	769000	This one.
769000	771000	Shy Monkey, I know about it.
771000	772000	The Shy Monkey.
772000	775000	Steve Levy, like, give you any number of shy monkeys.
775000	777000	Yeah, the See No Evil Monkey.
777000	778000	Yeah.
778000	779000	He does that in response to every time.
779000	782000	Like, Cody and I, for instance, like, we have a thing where...
782000	785000	Every time you talk about when he's looking ridiculous...
785000	786000	We'll show the photo.
786000	788000	We'll try to trick Steve Levy.
788000	789000	We'll go, like, if he...
789000	793000	Like, we'll go, hey, does the PR department have that one photo or something?
793000	795000	And it'll go, like, no, can I send you one?
795000	796000	And then it's always...
796000	801000	We'll send him a photo that Cody took of me laying on a hotel bed with my balls hanging
801000	803000	out of my underwear.
803000	804000	Other underwear?
804000	805000	And he keeps...
805000	807000	And then there's, like, all the Shy Monkey responses.
807000	808000	I need to sense that.
808000	809000	But also...
809000	810000	Oh, my God.
810000	814000	Talk about your balls in that photo, Dan, because your balls look spectacular in that photo.
814000	815000	They're big.
815000	816000	They're almost admitting...
816000	817000	Aww.
817000	818000	They're admitting their own light.
820000	821000	This looks amazing.
821000	822000	Look at this guy's photo roll.
822000	823000	He's such a company man.
823000	824000	Yeah, really.
824000	828000	There's got to be one weird dick pic in here, some horrible thing.
828000	829000	There's going to be one...
829000	830000	Yeah, it's going to be like this.
830000	831000	Maybe he knew you were going to use it.
831000	832000	There you go.
832000	834000	Oh, so cute.
834000	836000	Marlon Brando.
836000	838000	Tinder much?
838000	839000	Standing.
839000	840000	Oh, wow.
840000	841000	Oh, that's a secret.
841000	842000	Real monkey.
842000	843000	Uh-oh.
843000	844000	What is that?
844000	845000	That's a dick pic.
845000	846000	That's a weird dick pic.
846000	847000	Oh, there it is.
847000	849000	His dick looks like weird turkey jerky.
849000	851000	Oh, this is something we can analyze.
851000	853000	We put chili flakes on him.
853000	854000	Somebody's got a crush on him.
854000	855000	That's his sister, right?
855000	856000	A singer songwriter?
856000	857000	Okay.
857000	858000	Oh, I have a crush.
858000	859000	Okay.
859000	860000	All right.
860000	863000	He loves his family.
863000	864000	Okay, wait a minute.
864000	865000	This is so...
865000	866000	This is so unethical.
866000	867000	You know what?
867000	870000	I'm thinking, let's go through his underwear.
870000	875000	It's your job to find your underwear.
875000	879000	He's sitting back there going, keep going, motherfucker.
879000	882000	It's just going to be a receipt for yours.
882000	884000	That's what the snowman means.
884000	887000	It's a cocaine snowman.
887000	890000	Why is number one emoji on his thing snowman?
890000	892000	That means he's clearly a dealer.
892000	893000	Right.
893000	894000	Yeah.
894000	895000	Is it snowing in L.A.?
896000	898000	Is it snowing in San Diego?
898000	901000	Maybe he moonlights as one of Santa's elves.
901000	903000	Steve, do you want to come out and defend yourself?
903000	904000	Possibility.
904000	905000	Steve Levy, everybody.
905000	906000	Let's bring him out.
906000	907000	Steve Levy.
912000	913000	Oh, man.
913000	915000	Let's talk about that snowman first off.
915000	916000	Yeah.
916000	917000	What's the deal?
917000	919000	And then I want to talk about how many black Santas he used.
921000	922000	What?
922000	923000	It's true.
923000	924000	Don't look it up.
924000	925000	But I didn't hear him.
925000	926000	Yeah.
926000	927000	It's true.
927000	928000	What's the question?
928000	929000	Snowman.
930000	931000	Spill.
932000	934000	I use that for, like, hugs.
939000	940000	How?
940000	941000	Because it's like a snowman.
941000	942000	He's got his arms out.
942000	943000	Right.
943000	945000	And he's made of ice.
945000	947000	And you hug him and he'll melt and die.
947000	949000	And he's not of woman born.
950000	952000	He's a fucking robot.
953000	954000	And you're...
955000	960000	Dan, Dan, the children say he could dance and play just as much as you and me.
962000	963000	All right.
963000	965000	Well, what do you guys want the community movie to be about?
965000	968000	Because I've got to start writing a page from now on.
969000	975000	So Troy's on a pirate ship that he's taken over because he was a captive off screen.
975000	977000	Every once in a while I'm going to write a page a minute.
977000	979000	Does anybody have a timer?
979000	980000	Yeah, yeah.
980000	982000	Oh, this is what Steve's great at.
982000	983000	Logistics.
985000	986000	He's like, I have a timer.
986000	987000	Oh, this is a terrible...
987000	988000	Wait.
988000	989000	This is a terrible template.
989000	990000	I don't know why...
990000	991000	Pirate ship?
991000	992000	You actually have that as a location.
992000	993000	I need to just...
993000	1001000	Don't go to open recent because that's revealing some secret projects we're working on.
1001000	1007000	Dan, I want to take, like, six strips of paper and I want to hand these out to people.
1007000	1009000	I just want lines of dialogue that somebody might say in this.
1009000	1013000	I just want a neutral line of dialogue.
1013000	1014000	Maybe Dan will use these.
1014000	1016000	I think I asked them who has a pen first.
1016000	1019000	Yeah, don't let them take any pens from us.
1019000	1021000	We'll need those for later.
1021000	1022000	All right.
1022000	1024000	And you ready?
1025000	1026000	Well, let me...
1026000	1028000	I want to do an act thing.
1028000	1029000	Somehow it gets stuck on outlines.
1029000	1030000	How do you start an act?
1030000	1031000	Well, whatever.
1031000	1032000	It's act one.
1032000	1033000	I mean, you'll know that.
1033000	1036000	Like, we'll have a writer's assistant clean this up.
1036000	1037000	It sounds good.
1037000	1038000	James, you're in the audience, right?
1038000	1039000	Yeah.
1039000	1040000	James up here.
1040000	1041000	All right.
1041000	1042000	Here we go.
1042000	1043000	All right.
1043000	1044000	Here we go.
1044000	1045000	So one minute and then we'll get back to the show.
1045000	1046000	All right, let's do it.
1046000	1047000	Okay.
1047000	1049000	And, Jeff, you can read what I'm writing for the people that are listening.
1049000	1051000	Interior, pirate, ship, captain's...
1051000	1052000	Okay.
1052000	1053000	Yeah, you do it.
1053000	1054000	Okay.
1054000	1055000	She's closer to you, yeah.
1055000	1056000	Okay.
1056000	1057000	I don't...
1057000	1058000	Well, I don't know anything about the community that well.
1058000	1059000	No, you're doing good.
1059000	1060000	Okay.
1060000	1061000	So you'll have to give me names.
1061000	1062000	Oh, I'm sorry.
1062000	1063000	I'm sorry.
1063000	1064000	I'll applaud for you guys.
1064000	1065000	All right.
1065000	1066000	I'm pausing.
1066000	1067000	I'm pausing.
1067000	1068000	Oh, gosh.
1068000	1069000	Oh, gosh.
1069000	1070000	Oh, yeah.
1070000	1071000	Yeah.
1071000	1072000	Okay.
1072000	1073000	Yeah, that's...
1073000	1074000	See?
1074000	1076320	What podcast could change fonts to that size that quickly?
1076320	1078000	But I need to shrink it a little bit.
1078000	1081000	Also, what podcast is writing with the worst...
1081000	1083000	Only the one you set it to.
1083000	1085000	It's an odd choice.
1085000	1086000	Podcast gold.
1086000	1088000	Sorry, I had to shrink it.
1088000	1090000	It stands at his...
1090000	1091000	Oh, geez.
1091000	1092000	You're doing it.
1092000	1093000	Okay.
1093000	1094000	Oh, yes.
1094000	1095000	Spencer's doing it.
1095000	1096000	Map.
1096000	1097000	Or...
1097000	1098000	It's leisure.
1098000	1099000	Map.
1099000	1101000	I want leisure map to be a real thing.
1101000	1106000	It's like a treasure map, but for leisure.
1106000	1109000	X marks the bend.
1109000	1113000	He has a red macaw.
1113000	1116000	Well, it's dotted also.
1116000	1117000	Oh, very...
1117000	1120000	Yeah, you should know that they're trying to go somewhere.
1120000	1121000	Yeah.
1121000	1122000	Sorry, there was a macaw.
1122000	1124000	There's a red macaw in the corner.
1124000	1125000	Wait, is she narrating or...
1125000	1126000	I don't know.
1126000	1128000	It's a give and take situation right now.
1128000	1129000	Ghost writing.
1129000	1133000	This is what real writing is, you guys.
1133000	1136000	Treasure.
1136000	1138000	Treasureable.
1138000	1142000	This is my best red macaw impression.
1142000	1144000	Someone needs to enter now.
1144000	1146000	Yeah, there we go.
1146000	1147000	A girl?
1147000	1148000	Can it be...
1148000	1149000	Oh, mail.
1149000	1150000	Okay, damn it.
1150000	1151000	Uh-oh.
1151000	1153000	Can we make him peg left?
1153000	1154000	And that's a minute.
1154000	1155000	We did it.
1155000	1156000	That's a minute.
1156000	1157000	Damn it.
1157000	1158000	And a powered mail.
1158000	1159000	Finally, a white powered mail.
1159000	1160000	Oh, okay, all right.
1160000	1161000	Untitled How I Met Your Mother 3 is the perfect title.
1161000	1165000	Let's put that on the desktop next to Jordan Levy Resume.
1165000	1166000	Okay.
1166000	1167000	Wait.
1167000	1168000	How come I...
1168000	1169000	Untitled...
1169000	1170000	How I...
1170000	1171000	Man, I should not have used my mother's...
1171000	1172000	How I met your mother's...
1172000	1173000	Come on, retrieve it.
1173000	1174000	Okay.
1174000	1175000	Okay.
1175000	1176000	Okay.
1176000	1177000	Let's talk about dogs, racism, comic-con, sexual...
1177000	1178000	What about the boat party?
1178000	1179000	Let's talk about this yacht party.
1179000	1180000	Yeah, this yacht party.
1180000	1181000	Are we done?
1181000	1182000	Is that all we're doing now?
1182000	1183000	Okay.
1183000	1184000	That's it.
1184000	1185000	What happens?
1185000	1186000	Okay, Levy, didn't you get a tarot card reading at the...
1186000	1187000	She was a hack.
1187000	1188000	Did Cody tell you what she said?
1188000	1189000	I was there.
1189000	1190000	Yeah, well, she texted me to ask you about it.
1190000	1191000	Aw.
1191000	1192000	Oh, my God.
1192000	1193000	Oh, my God.
1193000	1194000	Oh, my God.
1194000	1195000	Oh, my God.
1195000	1196000	Oh, my God.
1196000	1197000	Oh, my God.
1197000	1198000	Oh, my God.
1198000	1199000	Oh, my God.
1199000	1200000	Oh, my God.
1200000	1201000	Oh, my God.
1201000	1202000	Oh, my God.
1202000	1203000	Oh, my God.
1203000	1205000	Cody texted me to ask you about it.
1205000	1206000	Aw.
1206000	1207000	Oh.
1207000	1208560	He's going to find love.
1208560	1209560	So Cody...
1209560	1218120	No, it was James and his wife, Roxie, they were like, oh, man, tarot cards, you guys, you
1218120	1219640	should get your tarot red.
1219640	1221320	And I was like, I don't know.
1221320	1222320	That sounds kind of strange.
1222320	1223320	And that's not for me.
1223320	1225320	This is how everyone gets their tarot card just red.
1225320	1226320	Yeah.
1226320	1227320	Well, okay.
1227320	1228320	So Cody comes in.
1228320	1229320	She's like, you're doing it.
1229320	1230320	And she sits me down.
1230320	1232200	And this lady, she's like, asks me questions.
1232400	1234000	Well, she asked me to shuffle the deck.
1234000	1235000	I shuffled the deck.
1235000	1236000	She's like, what do you want to know?
1236000	1239000	Like, what's a question you want answered?
1239000	1245360	And I said, I don't know, something about balance, how do I get balance in my life?
1245360	1246360	Sure.
1246360	1247360	Typical question.
1247360	1248360	Yeah.
1248360	1253640	And Cody's like, no, that's a bad question.
1253640	1256000	Say, like, ask about your love life.
1256000	1259040	And I was like, all right, let's do something about my love life.
1259040	1260040	And she...
1260040	1262040	Ask them about something they've rehearsed answering.
1262880	1263880	Balance.
1263880	1264880	They're like, I don't know.
1264880	1265880	Snickers.
1265880	1271000	Come on, ask me what are the three things you're supposed to ask so I can do my cold
1271000	1272000	reading technique.
1272000	1273000	All right.
1273000	1276040	So she goes, okay, so you want to figure out how to balance your work life with love life
1276040	1277040	and all this other stuff?
1277040	1278040	And I was like, yeah, sure.
1278040	1279040	That's great.
1279040	1280040	All right.
1280040	1281040	Shuffle the deck.
1281040	1282040	Put the cards out on the table.
1282040	1286040	And then she's like, okay, pick five cards.
1286040	1287760	And I picked five cards.
1287760	1291880	And she put them in this weird cross.
1292880	1294880	And she went, whoa, you had some weird cards.
1294880	1295880	This is weird.
1297880	1298880	And she gave you your money back.
1298880	1299880	That'll be $85.
1301880	1302880	Sorry, I can't help you.
1302880	1303880	Weird cards.
1303880	1304880	I'm in the wrong business.
1304880	1306880	It's like when you take a Honda to the mechanic.
1307880	1308880	And then she was like...
1308880	1313880	She gives you like a one sentence read out, like a broad, like, okay, here's the deal.
1313880	1314880	And I don't really remember what she said.
1314880	1317880	I wanted something along the lines of like...
1318880	1319880	No, continue, Stephen.
1320880	1321880	It's kind of like you right there.
1322880	1323880	I bet.
1323880	1326880	She sounds like she was like, oh, this is weird.
1327880	1328880	What did she say, Levy?
1328880	1331880	She said you were going to meet a girl from a crowd of 800 people.
1331880	1332880	No.
1332880	1335880	She said you need to focus on work right now.
1335880	1336880	Work is your life.
1336880	1339880	You got to keep working really hard because...
1339880	1341880	Work is your love life.
1341880	1345880	Because now is not the time for anything else in your life except for work.
1345880	1346880	And she said...
1346880	1348880	Cody slipped her 20.
1348880	1349880	No, Cody...
1349880	1352880	I slipped her 100 before this minute.
1352880	1354880	Just tell him work is his future.
1354880	1357880	Cody looked at me and she went, oh, this woman's a hack.
1357880	1359880	And then stopped listening instantly.
1359880	1360880	Yeah.
1360880	1363880	And then I was like, okay, explain to me these cards.
1363880	1366880	And she was like, okay, look, you got these like pentacles, which are coins.
1366880	1369880	And then you have a lot of swords.
1370880	1372880	There are a lot of swords in this.
1372880	1374880	She was like, you got some really rare cards in here.
1374880	1375880	Like cups.
1375880	1378880	Let me show you how they all link together.
1378880	1382880	How are there rare cards with the deck that she uses all this time?
1382880	1383880	This is like...
1383880	1385880	I didn't put this Joker in here.
1385880	1388880	It's like cards less chosen, I guess.
1388880	1389880	Whatever.
1389880	1390880	Or like...
1390880	1391880	Whatever.
1391880	1392880	It's hack.
1392880	1393880	Well, no, but what did she say?
1393880	1394880	Okay.
1394880	1395880	So she said...
1395880	1396880	Okay.
1396880	1401880	She said that it's very clear you're in an apprenticeship and you're working really hard.
1401880	1407880	And this middle card means this is a guy physically making coins.
1407880	1410880	And he's working really hard to make coins.
1410880	1413880	So she was saying like, you know...
1413880	1414880	Stick with it.
1414880	1415880	That's what you're doing.
1415880	1416880	That's like your life right now.
1416880	1417880	Is that guy.
1417880	1418880	Is that guy.
1418880	1425880	And the guy below is like this guy who's like a humble whatever and he's working really
1425880	1426880	hard.
1426880	1428880	And then the thing, the card to the left was strength.
1428880	1432200	There was a woman holding a lion's jaw open.
1432200	1436880	And she was like, you're really strong and really great at what you're doing and whatever.
1436880	1438600	You just don't stop.
1438600	1441600	Because at the top card was some kind of sword thing.
1441600	1443460	It was like a strong sword.
1443460	1447280	And she was like, which means eventually you will be like king.
1447280	1449200	You're going to get to where you want to be.
1449200	1450200	You're going to kill me.
1450200	1451200	No, no, no.
1451200	1452200	That's where this goes.
1452200	1453560	If we're on Game of Thrones.
1453560	1454560	I figured...
1454560	1456360	I'm fine with that.
1456360	1460640	But the card to the right of the center was nine swords down.
1460640	1462840	And she's like, this is a sad card.
1462840	1463840	This means that...
1463840	1464840	She's like, you're Jewish.
1464840	1465840	He'll be sad for killing him.
1465840	1466840	This is a Jew card.
1466840	1471880	She said that you're going to have some kind of like emotional turmoil in the future that
1471880	1473040	you'll have to work through.
1473040	1474040	Whether that's like an emot...
1474040	1475040	Like something internal.
1475040	1476040	Yeah.
1476040	1477040	Bold prediction.
1477040	1478040	Yeah.
1478040	1479040	Yeah.
1479040	1480040	She really risked a lot.
1480040	1483120	There will be a death and you're a family eventually.
1483120	1486520	I see good times and bad times.
1486520	1489880	She brought it all back around and was like, this is not the time for love or anything
1489880	1494040	else in your life except for working as an apprentice.
1494040	1495440	And you'll get to where you...
1495440	1500080	Accruing disposable income and frequent visits to me.
1500080	1501080	Your chiropractor.
1501080	1503920	I mean tarot card lady.
1503920	1504920	They're all the same.
1504920	1505920	They're all the same.
1505920	1506920	All right.
1506920	1507920	Back on community.
1507920	1508920	Maybe.
1508920	1509920	What is it?
1509920	1510920	Okay.
1510920	1512440	So these are phrases that I'm supposed to work into the...
1513440	1514440	People might write down...
1514440	1515440	Holy S?
1515440	1518440	Maybe incorporate some of this dialogue.
1518440	1519440	All right.
1519440	1520440	Can we get...
1520440	1521440	Let's try multitasking.
1521440	1525840	I'm going to try to finish this page while we talk about the fact that we were on the
1525840	1526840	Game of Thrones yacht.
1526840	1527840	Yeah.
1527840	1528840	That was the coolest thing ever.
1528840	1529840	But it wasn't the Game of Thrones yacht.
1529840	1531840	It was the Justin Roiland, Rick and Morty, Alex Hirsch.
1531840	1532840	Yeah.
1532840	1533840	Cliff Blazinski.
1533840	1539040	But apparently the Game of Thrones people really like Rick and Morty.
1539040	1540040	You walk down...
1540040	1541040	Let me set the stage for you.
1541040	1544480	You walk the back of the Marriott into a marina and you go to the...
1544480	1546920	I went through the gate and I said, where do we go?
1546920	1547920	We're on the F dock.
1547920	1548920	And he goes, yeah, you see that boat down there?
1548920	1549920	Like the one with the smokestack?
1549920	1553760	I'm like, the one that looks like the old yachts.
1553760	1554760	I thought we were going to be...
1554760	1555760	The oldest yacht on the dock.
1555760	1558640	I thought we were going to be on some crappy little boat and we'd all be jammed on like
1558640	1560000	a little tiny thing.
1560000	1561680	It was this big ass yacht.
1561680	1570160	But like old timey, it's a 1929 yacht called High Spirits and it looks like the Rockefellers
1570160	1573080	might have fucked on that yacht at one point.
1573080	1574080	And there was...
1574080	1575080	Yeah.
1575080	1576080	There was veggie burgers and sliders on top.
1576080	1577400	I didn't see those.
1577400	1578400	You didn't go on top?
1578400	1579400	No.
1579400	1580400	I only...
1580400	1581800	I stopped when all of the Game of Thrones people were there.
1581800	1582800	No, I didn't...
1582800	1583800	I got stuck.
1583800	1584800	Spencer, you...
1584800	1585800	Nerding out.
1585800	1586800	We have to get code on which Spencer...
1586800	1587800	I'll call you Grammar.
1587800	1588800	Carl.
1588800	1589800	Carl and Grammar.
1589800	1590800	Yeah.
1590800	1591800	Okay.
1591800	1592800	Spencer G.
1592800	1593800	Yeah.
1593800	1594800	What up?
1594800	1595800	What up?
1595800	1599520	I didn't even cross your path, but then I'm walking through one of the areas of the boat
1599520	1603200	like around the bow and I turn a corner and I see a guy and he's this kind of good-looking
1603200	1604200	chubby dude.
1604200	1606200	And I look and it's Samwell?
1606200	1607200	Yeah.
1607200	1608200	Yeah.
1608200	1609200	Like the guy that likes books...
1609200	1610200	Do you think his name is James?
1610200	1611200	He killed the white...
1611200	1612200	He killed the white walker?
1612200	1613200	He killed the white walker.
1613200	1614200	With the dragon glass.
1614200	1615200	Yeah, he was...
1615200	1616200	I just walking through...
1616200	1617200	I shook his hands.
1617200	1619200	I didn't know that there was ever gonna be Game of Thrones people and I go...
1619200	1620200	Me neither.
1620200	1621200	I try to go, oh!
1621200	1625440	And I put my hand out and he gives me like his kind of, you know, it's like kind of nervous,
1625440	1626440	like Samwell hands.
1626440	1627440	Is that his name, Samwell?
1627440	1628440	I think so.
1628960	1629960	Yeah.
1629960	1632880	And he gives me a hand and he goes, hey!
1632880	1633880	I go, oh, it's...
1633880	1634880	Oh, shit!
1634880	1635880	I don't know his name.
1635880	1638880	I'm like, I love you on the show and he goes, oh, that's really nice.
1638880	1642280	I'm like, Jesus Christ, then I turn the corner and there's Ramsay.
1642280	1643280	Yeah.
1643280	1644280	Fucking everybody's there.
1644280	1646280	He's a lot less pale in real life.
1646280	1647280	Also, he's...
1647280	1648280	He's yay high.
1648280	1649280	He's quite...
1649280	1650280	He's quite small.
1650280	1653200	I didn't officially get to meet Ramsay, although he said, excuse me, as he walked by.
1653200	1654200	I was...
1654200	1655200	I walked up...
1655200	1658360	He said there were shots and Justin was doing shots and fucking Ramsay Bolton was doing
1658360	1659360	shots.
1659360	1660360	It's like, he's...
1660360	1661360	Wait, they just...
1661360	1664720	And his arms were sinewy and looking at his veins and he's like...
1664720	1665720	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1665720	1666720	And he's like...
1666720	1667720	His veins had biceps.
1667720	1668880	And then he spoke and he said...
1668880	1670400	He was the same guy.
1670400	1671400	He said the same...
1671400	1672960	That's the thing about the Game of Thrones, people.
1672960	1677080	I've never been that big a fan of anything that everybody has...
1677080	1681640	All their faces were like, you're the guy, you're the person.
1681640	1686280	And one of the actors was...
1686280	1692680	She was an unassuming jolly lady who was drinking and everybody's like...
1692680	1693680	And she goes...
1693680	1696880	I think her friend said, do you know who this is?
1696880	1701280	And she's like, give her the look and she makes this look and I'm like, wait, I know
1701280	1702280	that look.
1702280	1703280	And it's like...
1703280	1704280	The unnamed girl.
1704280	1710200	She's the girl who truly has no name, who stabs Arya, she's the fucking terminator of
1710200	1711200	the...
1712200	1715600	Everybody on the ship, there was like, sir, no fingers.
1715600	1720160	And you know, I don't know, sir, no fingers was on there.
1720160	1724600	I mean, because he was, they say his character is going to come back from the dead.
1724600	1725600	Sir, no fingers.
1725600	1727440	He's going to grow all of his fingers back.
1727440	1733400	The guy who tried to close the deal at the Iron Bank by going, look, he's great at accounting.
1733400	1735400	Oh, yes.
1735400	1736400	That guy was hanging out.
1736400	1737400	Everybody was...
1737400	1738400	Spencer.
1738400	1739400	Spencer G.
1739400	1742160	He was saying that there was Davos.
1742160	1743160	That's him, Davos.
1743160	1744160	Sir, no fingers.
1744160	1745160	And the eunuch.
1745160	1746160	The eunuch.
1746160	1747160	Varys.
1747160	1748160	Varys was there.
1748160	1749160	I didn't see anything.
1749160	1750160	Wait, Varys was there?
1750160	1753160	Varys was there because he had hair and a tan.
1753160	1754160	Oh, oh, oh.
1754160	1755160	And it's tan.
1755160	1756160	And so nobody recognized him.
1756160	1757160	He just looked like George Hamilton.
1757160	1763000	My husband has known him for many years because he has done, he worked in the London theater.
1763000	1766640	My husband was a firefighter, so he would work the fire department stuff that they did.
1766640	1768840	I don't know, they just walked shows, basically.
1768840	1772240	So he's known him forever, and he's Irish.
1772240	1777000	And when I watch Game of Thrones, I'm really attracted to him, so it was really awkward
1777000	1778000	tonight.
1778000	1779000	Wow.
1779000	1780000	Yeah, I know.
1780000	1781000	It's weird.
1781000	1782000	I know.
1782000	1783000	It's okay.
1783000	1784000	I'm dealing with it.
1784000	1791480	So I was shocked and amazed that I had a 10-minute conversation with him.
1791480	1792720	That's my husband back there.
1792720	1793720	Oh, shit.
1793720	1794720	Please.
1794720	1797400	Irish firefighter, you're here?
1797400	1798400	What's your name, sir?
1799400	1800400	James.
1800400	1801400	Hello, James.
1801400	1802400	James.
1802400	1803400	It was really amazing.
1803400	1804400	Were you there on the yacht, too, James?
1804400	1805400	No, I mean, I'm embellishing.
1805400	1806400	Now that I know that you're here, it's fine.
1806400	1807400	Well, he's a eunuch, so it's fine.
1807400	1808400	Exactly.
1808400	1809400	Nothing can happen.
1809400	1810400	Yeah.
1810400	1811400	Yeah.
1811400	1812400	And he got his revenge.
1812400	1813400	He got that whatever his name is.
1813400	1814400	He was the guy in the box?
1814400	1815400	That potion guy in the box.
1815400	1816400	Where?
1816400	1826400	How come we've never figured out where that box guy went to?
1826400	1827400	He's somewhere.
1827400	1829400	He just carries him with him every time he's traveling.
1829400	1830400	Yeah, I don't know.
1830400	1831400	That was just like a glimpse of his backstory.
1831400	1832400	Right?
1832400	1833400	And then it never got revealed later.
1833400	1834400	Yeah.
1834400	1835400	I mean, can they bring that back?
1835400	1838400	I think it was a back door pilot about the box wizard that HBO was trying to shop around.
1838400	1839400	They were going to do like a spin-off.
1839400	1840400	The box wizard.
1840400	1841400	Yeah.
1841400	1842400	I feel like they really were.
1842400	1843400	Hello.
1843400	1847400	My name's Amanda Faius Langwermer.
1847400	1853400	Years ago, I horribly mutilated a child to get red magic from my blood god.
1853400	1854400	Yeah.
1854400	1855400	To get the blood magic.
1855400	1856400	Hey, Amanda for the box.
1856400	1857400	This is my story.
1857400	1858400	It was rough.
1858400	1859400	It was a rough episode.
1859400	1860400	Okay.
1860400	1861400	It was pretty amazing, actually.
1861400	1862400	Because I didn't really know what to expect to go on to that yacht.
1862400	1863400	I thought it was just going to be like, I don't swim people, Rick and Morty people.
1863400	1865400	And then like the entire cast of Game of Thrones was there.
1865400	1870400	So it was just a Rick and Morty and Game of Thrones party, which I thought was extremely
1870400	1871400	exclusive.
1871400	1872400	And I had no idea.
1872400	1884400	I fit into that crowd, like a whole-age crowd, you know.
1885400	1887400	I was at the indigo room earlier.
1887400	1889400	That's a good one, too.
1889400	1891400	I had gotten the boat quite early before anybody was there.
1891400	1894400	Like we got on very early, my friend and I, and we came in there.
1894400	1897400	And it's a boat built in 1929.
1897400	1901400	And I'm six foot four with like heels on my shoes, like dress shoes.
1901400	1903400	So I had to duck everywhere I go.
1903400	1904400	So I'm Hodor.
1904400	1906400	Like I'm walking through.
1906400	1908400	I'm walking through things.
1908400	1912400	And so I'm meeting people that are on Game of Thrones who are quite wee.
1912400	1913400	Small.
1913400	1914400	So I'm talking to them.
1914400	1915400	Hello.
1915400	1917400	My head is tilted.
1917400	1918400	I didn't like that.
1918400	1921400	I felt like a weird character in Game of Thrones.
1921400	1925400	Apparently, so last night, the rumor spread throughout the Adult Swim party that Hodor
1925400	1928400	was a DJ and that he was DJing at this club.
1928400	1929400	The Omnia.
1929400	1931400	So everybody was like, let's go see Hodor DJ.
1931400	1932400	And we went.
1932400	1937400	So you and I and Ryan Ridley and like a bunch of other people went to this club that was
1937400	1940400	like, we were all dressed like San Diego tourists.
1940400	1945400	And the club was like velvet rope and just like very like it was it was like.
1945400	1948400	And they had gray that's like cold to air.
1948400	1951400	Like no one from Comic Con was like go get it.
1951400	1955400	You know, it was like it was like bottle service kind of like grody grody chic.
1955400	1960400	And and then like I got a text from somebody that I had texted at a Hail Mary and they said
1960400	1961400	say this.
1961400	1962400	And I said what they said.
1962400	1965400	And they walked immediately in like we were rock stars.
1965400	1966400	And it was like.
1966400	1977400	And we were like what?
1977400	1981400	But like Hodor wasn't there.
1981400	1985400	But like Ridley and I were just like Hodor.
1985400	1987400	And we were also high and drunk.
1987400	1992400	And so Ridley was like Ridley was like dancing like in the front row of this thing.
1992400	1995400	And I was just like whispering in his ear doing like this Hodor rap like to the beat.
1995400	1997400	I was like Hodor hold the door.
1997400	1999400	Gonna hold the door and then hold three more.
1999400	2000400	Gonna hold those doors.
2000400	2001400	And hold it some more.
2001400	2002400	Gonna hold every door.
2002400	2003400	And you go to the war.
2003400	2005400	Hodor go in the war.
2005400	2006400	World War three.
2006400	2007400	Gonna hold on.
2007400	2008400	Gonna hold the door for me.
2008400	2009400	Gonna hold the door.
2009400	2010400	And then hold four doors.
2010400	2011400	Gonna hold some more doors.
2011400	2012400	And then hold up more war.
2012400	2014400	And he was like crying.
2014400	2017400	But so we and then we left like in five minutes.
2017400	2018400	You left immediately.
2018400	2021400	I was like I need ear plugs to survive.
2021400	2024400	We hung out for five minutes and did Hodor jokes and then we left.
2024400	2028400	Apparently Hodor had been up there before we got there.
2028400	2030400	Sorry because I ran into Jonah Ray.
2030400	2032400	And I did too after that.
2032400	2035400	And he was like did you guys go to the Hodor show?
2035400	2036400	I was like no.
2036400	2037400	I guess he doesn't go to an opera.
2037400	2040400	And he's like no he was up before you guys got there.
2040400	2041400	And I was like okay so what happened?
2041400	2043400	He's like he's just like a giant DJ.
2043400	2048400	And he was like I guess he's like Swedish or who knows what you know.
2048400	2050400	He only says one word anyway.
2050400	2054400	He only says like flow more.
2054400	2056400	That's Jeff.
2056400	2057400	That's Jeff.
2057400	2061400	He should be a DJ flow more.
2061400	2069400	But he's like Jonah said like yeah he came up and was like go figure.
2069400	2072400	And then he did that for a while and I was like yay.
2072400	2076400	And then at one point he dropped the beat and was like how's everybody doing tonight.
2076400	2081400	And everyone went Hodor.
2081400	2085400	And he went.
2085400	2087400	He like shook it off.
2087400	2088400	Like we don't know if.
2088400	2090400	What did he think was going to happen.
2090400	2091400	We don't know if he was bummed out.
2091400	2094400	Like does that mean he hated it or.
2094400	2099400	That's just from Cirque du Soleil was here nine years ago.
2099400	2101400	That was the last fetter.
2101400	2107400	Actually there's still acid on that.
2107400	2110400	I like that it's like Jonah Ray's impression of Hodor.
2110400	2114400	He's like a golden retriever coming out of a swamp.
2114400	2116400	We don't know.
2116400	2117400	Loves it hates it.
2117400	2119400	Who cares.
2119400	2122400	Time to get back to fetching.
2122400	2124400	How's everybody doing.
2124400	2127400	Hodor.
2127400	2129400	That's just a job.
2129400	2134400	Everybody at the Game of Thrones people are super chill and they're able to be because they're all foreigners.
2134400	2139400	They don't like they are like like like Samwell.
2139400	2143400	Who you see Samwell like like you haven't lived.
2143400	2144400	This guy.
2144400	2147400	But he looked exactly like you.
2147400	2149400	They all look exactly like what they are.
2149400	2150400	You give him one.
2150400	2152400	You give him one for a vest and he's fucking ready to go.
2152400	2153400	Exactly.
2153400	2155400	The fucking dudes like the guy Davos had the fucking beard.
2155400	2157400	It's only green screen fingers gone.
2157400	2160400	They're all just hanging out and vaping and stuff.
2160400	2166400	And Samwell had this fucking he was just dressed like fucking like a cool street magician.
2166400	2168400	But he was like Samwell.
2168400	2171400	And I'm not saying like he wasn't trying to pull anything off.
2171400	2172400	Like he looked great.
2172400	2176400	But he's just like oh yeah you look great but he's not Samwell.
2176400	2178400	He's not wearing a feather clip.
2178400	2180400	But he was like hanging out in a black button up shirt.
2180400	2182400	And he's like yeah hey.
2183400	2186400	And they're all from like Manchester and Belfast and all this stuff.
2186400	2188400	And they shoot in all these different cities.
2188400	2191400	And so they just this was like their fourth comic con.
2191400	2196400	And they and I was like I just kept asking the same question over and over again which is like how do you handle it.
2196400	2197400	How do you do it.
2197400	2198400	How do you Obama.
2198400	2203400	And I think that's the question we all ask them because we're all just like oh what would happen if you ever had this much.
2203400	2208400	And I think because they're from Europe they're kind of like they don't really even understand that question.
2208400	2212400	Like and not in a like high roadie humble braggy way.
2212400	2216400	It's like well they don't they don't have the same culture.
2216400	2218400	And so it's like they're kind of like this is amazing.
2218400	2221400	And then they go back to Manchester and they hang out.
2221400	2222400	I'm sure they're lying.
2222400	2224400	You know that they go home and they're like I'm a fucking God.
2224400	2226400	And they snort a million lines of cocaine.
2226400	2229400	And there's like fucking three like children tied up.
2229400	2230400	And they're like fuck you.
2230400	2232400	I look at my forums all the time.
2232400	2236400	I realize I have to get out of here soon to get to the Balboa to do the show.
2236400	2239400	And I went to say goodbye to you Dan said like I'm leaving soon.
2239400	2247400	And I looked and Justin Ryland whom I've done forever because like Channel 101 and House of Cosby is and all the stupid stuff that we've made.
2247400	2254400	And now Rick and Morty and he's up there and he's got like 19 glasses out and it's just tequila shots for all the Game of Thrones people.
2254400	2259400	Like all of our nerdy friends and some of the Game of Thrones cast is fucking crazy.
2259400	2261400	It was really cool.
2261400	2264400	I can't believe I didn't see Jared Davos.
2264400	2265400	Oh you're right right now.
2265400	2267400	It was it was pretty amazing.
2267400	2268400	Yeah.
2268400	2270400	But because I was watching everybody line up at Holly.
2270400	2272400	It's like my hotel room is from there.
2272400	2277400	So everyone was just like sleeping and down there and I was like I kind of wish I was down there too.
2277400	2279400	I have our panel today anyway.
2279400	2284400	So to actually meet all of them like just regular chilling on a boat was cool.
2284400	2285400	Yeah.
2285400	2288400	I wish that boat just kind of unmoored and just went out to sea.
2288400	2290400	We just like we'd probably survive.
2290400	2291400	I mean they know how to do it.
2291400	2292400	I don't know.
2292400	2293400	People were pretty drunk.
2294400	2295400	It's OK.
2295400	2298400	We can't live on those stale veggie burgers forever.
2299400	2300400	I didn't have one.
2300400	2301400	So sorry.
2301400	2302400	Actually they're pretty good.
2304400	2305400	Was it.
2305400	2306400	Were you all on the boat.
2307400	2308400	Did.
2308400	2309400	Did you see the.
2309400	2310400	It folds it.
2310400	2311400	I mean it's a treasure map.
2311400	2312400	It's a.
2314400	2315400	It's a.
2316400	2317400	Movie.
2318400	2319400	Comes and it goes.
2320400	2321400	It's in the way that you.
2322400	2323400	Do.
2324400	2325400	Trouble.
2326400	2327400	No one knows the words of that fucking.
2327400	2328400	Yeah.
2329400	2330400	It's a little bit for my time.
2331400	2332400	Wow.
2332400	2333400	OK.
2335400	2336400	Spencer T.
2336400	2337400	Let's let's talk about your strappy shoes.
2337400	2339400	You got a back story for these strappy shoes.
2339400	2340400	They were fifteen dollars.
2341400	2342400	Oh damn.
2342400	2343400	They're on sale.
2345400	2346400	That's a good story.
2346400	2347400	Thanks.
2347400	2350400	No I was wearing heels earlier and I just was like fuck it.
2350400	2351400	This is ridiculous.
2352400	2353400	Thank you.
2353400	2354400	So many.
2354400	2356400	I was wearing heels last night and there were two girls behind me as I was
2356400	2361400	walking back to our hotel after the Hodor event and they were like I can't
2361400	2362400	believe she's wearing heels.
2363400	2364400	How is she even surviving.
2364400	2366400	I mean if I had to wear heels and I was like I'm not wearing heels tomorrow
2366400	2367400	night.
2367400	2368400	This is embarrassing now.
2369400	2372400	I guess I should have I should have a personal chauffeur is what I should
2372400	2373400	have.
2373400	2374400	Oh yeah.
2374400	2375400	Can I tell you.
2375400	2377400	Can I share a darker darker side of Comic Con with you guys.
2377400	2378400	Oh please do.
2378400	2379400	Please.
2379400	2380400	Because it's not all fun and games.
2381400	2386400	I went I got in a cab as one does and the cab driver he said you here for
2386400	2387400	Comic Con.
2387400	2388400	I said yes.
2389400	2391400	And he said how is your humor.
2393400	2394400	And I said the for him.
2395400	2396400	Nice.
2397400	2398400	I said I don't know.
2399400	2400400	It's not good.
2400400	2401400	I don't I don't know.
2402400	2408400	And he said well can you tell me what the Joker calls Batman's motorcycle.
2410400	2411400	And I was.
2413400	2417400	I kept that I ran through all the racist possibilities I was like I don't
2417400	2420400	know a Chinese brown.
2421400	2424400	I was just like racist racist racist and then I was like misogyny misogyny
2424400	2425400	like what is it.
2425400	2426400	How does this hurt people.
2427400	2430400	Because a cab driver is asking me knock knock.
2430400	2432400	So how can the who's there hurt someone.
2433400	2434400	And I was like I don't know.
2434400	2437400	And he said so the question was can you tell me what Joker calls Batman's
2437400	2438400	motorcycle.
2438400	2439400	And I said I don't know.
2439400	2441400	And he said Yamaha.
2444400	2447400	And then he just kept driving as if he hadn't ruined my day.
2450400	2451400	He's like so anyway he's left up here.
2451400	2452400	I'm like left up here.
2453400	2454400	Life means nothing.
2454400	2455400	Let me out.
2455400	2456400	Let me out.
2456400	2460400	Drive faster and let me fucking jump out.
2461400	2466400	Or just let me dip my head out and just fucking shave half my brain off on
2466400	2471400	the concrete so that I can lean back up and hopefully just fit in until I die.
2472400	2473400	That reminds me.
2473400	2476400	That's so parallel to a joke I heard a long time ago.
2476400	2478400	What is Popeye's favorite book of the Bible?
2479400	2480400	Hebba.
2481400	2482400	It's the same joke.
2482400	2483400	It's stupid.
2483400	2484400	Stupid.
2485400	2487400	The San Diego Comic Con is part of all the local businesses.
2488400	2489400	It's a constant reminder.
2489400	2493400	It's like on one hand we all come together and we all go we're all not so
2493400	2494400	different.
2494400	2498400	But then in the form of like the wait staff and the managers of the local
2498400	2502400	businesses you get reminded of like oh the world is run by my dad.
2503400	2508400	Because people will just be like the pizza restaurant will be like flash pizza.
2509400	2512400	Because the cheese is fast.
2513400	2517400	They're just trying so hard but they refuse to pick up a fucking comic book.
2518400	2519400	They're like I'm not.
2520400	2522400	Look you nerds are here this week.
2522400	2524400	The Japanese will be here next week.
2524400	2526400	I'm not going to fucking like I don't give a shit.
2526400	2527400	It's a city of festivals.
2528400	2530400	I don't fucking like like fuck you.
2530400	2532400	We're like we're like Bespin.
2532400	2534400	We just fucking like we're Babylon 5.
2534400	2535400	People come through.
2535400	2537400	We're going to lose the Chargers any day now.
2537400	2539400	All we have is this shit.
2539400	2544400	At the U.S. Grant Hotel which is a fancy old school hotel on the fancy cocktail
2544400	2546400	menu one of them was the White Walker.
2548400	2549400	That's pretty hip man.
2549400	2551400	Is it just a white Russian?
2551400	2553400	It was but there was blue in it.
2553400	2554400	What was it rum?
2554400	2555400	Blue Kierke.
2556400	2561400	You said just like the drink specials are like the super gimlet.
2562400	2563400	Super gimlet.
2563400	2566400	The hulking tequila sunrise.
2567400	2571400	The fantastic four hot wing platter.
2571400	2573400	How many hot wings are there?
2573400	2574400	Seven.
2575400	2576400	But why?
2576400	2577400	Because it's the name.
2577400	2578400	I don't know nerd.
2579400	2580400	Get the fuck out of here.
2581400	2582400	God damn it.
2582400	2583400	It could at least be eight.
2583400	2585400	So at least it's like multiple you know.
2585400	2586400	Two per fucking guy.
2586400	2588400	It's like no they're like look I know.
2588400	2592400	Do you want the Spider-Man plate to have fucking spiders on it?
2593400	2594400	I said one bar.
2594400	2596400	You want me to run a Hooters the way that Hooters needs to be run.
2596400	2597400	Yeah please.
2598400	2599400	Dr. Hooters.
2602400	2603400	Oh man.

2638400	2639400	In a skirt.
2642400	2645400	The logo is a police box with tits.
2646400	2648400	Yes. Oh my God.
2649400	2650400	In a skirt.

2675400	2676400	Well someone needs to read what I'm doing.
2677400	2678400	Oh Dr. Hooters Waitress 34 approaches.
2679400	2680400	Well you have to go back to the script.
2681400	2682400	Okay. In to your Dr. Hooters moments later.
2683400	2684400	Jeff Winger 34 enters.
2685400	2686400	Jeff. I'd like some hot wings.
2688400	2689400	Dr. Hooters Waitress 34 approaches.
2690400	2691400	You can have three.
2694400	2695400	Only three hot wings.
2703400	2704400	That's fine but.

2724400	2725400	Dr. Hooters Waitress I fucked up.
2726400	2727400	It's all good.

2730400	2732400	The doctor who who who do you wear.
2733400	2734400	Or what are you wearing.

2737400	2738400	I'm trying to come up with some really good pun.
2739400	2740400	I know you hate those.
2741400	2742400	Can I pitch a name for the evil manager of Dr.
2743400	2744400	Hooters. Okay.

2775400	2777400	Well you put him in a wheelchair that means nothing can be wrong with him.
2778400	2779400	Yeah he has to be just a nice person now.
2780400	2782400	Davros exterminate that guy in the thing.
2783400	2784400	It's Davros right.
2785400	2786400	Yeah he's.
2788400	2790400	He loved that for some reason.
2793400	2794400	It's like Dr.
2795400	2796400	I mean he can't.
2799400	2800400	And then and then the Hooters Waitress stabs him.
2801400	2802400	Fucking.
2803400	2804400	Just because she can.
2804400	2805400	Bullet dodged.
2808400	2809400	Doctor Waitress.
2810400	2811400	Anyways.
2812400	2813400	Doctor Waitress.
2814400	2816400	Let me show you to your fucking seat.
2817400	2818400	God.
2819400	2820400	This way.
2827400	2828400	She shows him his seat.
2829400	2831400	It's shaped like a King Kong hand.
2832400	2834400	Jeff regards it suspiciously.
2837400	2838400	Suspicion mounting.
2839400	2840400	Suspect.
2841400	2842400	That chair.
2843400	2844400	Then.
2845400	2846400	Of being.
2847400	2848400	A King Kong hand.
2849400	2850400	Oh shit.
2850400	2851400	The tension is mounting.
2854400	2855400	Someone else can play Jeff.
2855400	2856400	It's okay.
2856400	2858400	I'm not I'm not like totally sold on my voice for Jeff.
2859400	2861400	The waitress is flummoxed but non plus.
2864400	2865400	Yet.
2866400	2867400	Nice punch up.
2868400	2869400	Okay.
2870400	2871400	Doctor Waitress.
2871400	2872400	There's your title.
2875400	2876400	Just sit in it.
2877400	2878400	She gives him a gentle shove.
2881400	2882400	Close.
2882400	2884400	Close on her fingertips as they plant a.
2885400	2886400	Blinking.
2887400	2890400	Device on his lapel.
2891400	2892400	Okay.
2892400	2893400	Let's talk about rape culture.
2896400	2897400	It's bad.
2897400	2898400	Oh.
2898400	2899400	Who's run up against it today.
2902400	2903400	Me me.
2905400	2907400	We also have clips at some point.
2907400	2908400	Oh yeah.
2908400	2909400	I'm sorry.
2909400	2910400	Yeah.
2910400	2911400	Some of you came here.
2911400	2912400	I did a lot of things to try to get you all here.
2912400	2913400	Who's dissatisfied.
2913400	2915400	Who's really who's like I hate the show.
2918400	2919400	There's like a section over here.
2920400	2921400	Yeah.
2921400	2922400	Do you guys have a representative.
2922400	2924400	Is there like somebody who's like community leader.
2924400	2927400	I can speak for everybody when I say like look like the show's terrible.
2928400	2929400	They're pointing at one guy.
2930400	2933400	I mean you'll come up and then you'll say stuff and everyone will hate you and they'll.
2934400	2935400	Fuck that.
2936400	2937400	That happened and fucking leave.
2938400	2939400	Yeah.
2939400	2940400	There's clips of what.
2941400	2942400	That's all we wanted to do is reverse bully you.
2943400	2944400	Yeah.
2944400	2945400	Just insecure about having a bad show.
2945400	2946400	So we're like fuck you.
2946400	2947400	Fuck you.
2947400	2948400	Fuck you.
2948400	2949400	We got.
2949400	2950400	We got.
2950400	2951400	I will make it good.
2951400	2952400	I will fucking bleed for you.
2952400	2957400	Search with your blood in the same dirt that we were born off you ungrateful prick.
2958400	2960400	You fucking terrible person.
2961400	2962400	I'm kidding.
2963400	2966400	We've got some Justin Roiland voiced we have.
2967400	2970400	So we have like I almost wanted to give people a choice because I have a 10 minute clip that has nothing.
2971400	2972400	It's Rick and Morty related.
2972400	2973400	And it's like really well done.
2974400	2975400	It is good but it has.
2975400	2976400	It's real funny.
2979400	2981400	I mean you're going to be sitting here watching a thing for 10 minutes.
2983400	2992400	But it is it's so it's there was this court case that happened recently and it went viral a little bit subviral.
2993400	2997400	It happened in Atlanta Georgia Georgia Georgia courthouse.
2998400	3011400	There was transcripts of the court case where the guy that was being he was trying to fire his lawyer so he could represent himself and the judge is like talking to him and going like you shouldn't represent yourself and it's just a transcript of that.
3012400	3015400	But it takes a lot of fucking turns and it's insane.
3015400	3023400	Like the guy just starts like yelling at the judge and then after a while the judge goes around the bend and you like just when you think you know who you're rooting for.
3023400	3024400	I don't know.
3024400	3028400	But it was how many of you are familiar with what I'm talking about just by a father.
3029400	3033400	So it's like yeah it went kind of subviral like you know there was a Kardashian doing something that day.
3034400	3041400	It was like it didn't it didn't quite make it but like when it was at its peak and we were like reading it in the writers room Rick and Morty and then Erica Hayes like one of our favorite storyboard artists.
3042400	3045400	At Rick and Morty Justin ran to her and said like can you just draw.
3045400	3047400	Let's do because we were reading it out loud.
3047400	3050400	I was like we should just do this like like and get it out put it on YouTube.
3051400	3062400	So it was like draw Rick and Morty doing this scene and Justin's like yeah it's like Morty should be the judge and Rick should be the the plaintiff or not the plaintiff defendant.
3063400	3064400	Yeah because it's the guy.
3064400	3065400	So so we do it.
3065400	3069400	Erica Hayes like like I mean she fucking scrambled out of her.
3069400	3070400	Her art is so great.
3070400	3080400	It's like like and Justin like like recorded it in the Bay and like it's it won't seem like 10 minutes in my opinion because I played it for you.
3080400	3082400	Even just the audio and it's like it goes by pretty quick.
3082400	3083400	But I would like it to be an hour.
3083400	3088400	I think the important thing you have to understand is that this is word for word literally verbatim.
3088400	3089400	You can look it up online.
3089400	3091400	This is absolutely word for word.
3091400	3095400	Not a single word is different from the actual court transcript.
3095400	3104400	This actually happened in a courtroom recently in the 21st century without and it wasn't Rick and Morty and it was not Rick and Morty.
3104400	3107400	Although it seems like it was listening to it.
3107400	3109400	And so can we just yeah.
3109400	3111400	Oh you need this.
3111400	3124400	So what I do think for those of you who might be like oh I'm listening to this on audio.
3124400	3126400	It actually no it functions fine as audio.
3126400	3129400	It's all you're seeing is not very visual.
3129400	3130400	Two images.
3130400	3133400	But but yeah they work well.
3133400	3134400	But I do.
3134400	3137400	I also have a clip of season three from season three and Rick and Morty.
3137400	3143400	But I actually I actually think this is like this is kind of I mean I don't know.
3143400	3144400	Yeah.
3144400	3145400	Well it's arguably better.
3145400	3148400	But yeah this may never be seen again.
3148400	3149400	Who knows.
3149400	3150400	Maybe.
3150400	3151400	Yeah.
3151400	3152400	Legally maybe we can't we don't know.
3152400	3153400	Yeah.
3153400	3154400	But it's like a public document.
3154400	3159400	It's like that was that went over 10 times better than I thought.
3159400	3161400	I mean like I.
3161400	3163400	That's crazy.
3163400	3165400	That actually all happened.
3165400	3166400	You stole my phone.
3166400	3167400	Oh yeah.
3167400	3168400	Because I.
3168400	3169400	Yeah.
3169400	3170400	It was it was forced to have it.
3170400	3171400	It was on my chair.
3171400	3173400	So I get to keep it.
3173400	3174400	I don't know where your phone is.
3174400	3176400	Oh I feel like I.
3176400	3177400	I must have.
3177400	3180400	Did you check the other derail the show.
3180400	3182400	Just give it.
3182400	3183400	Yeah.
3183400	3184400	Fucking amazing.
3184400	3185400	For a bag of coffee.
3185400	3186400	For.
3186400	3187400	There's so many.
3187400	3188400	I mean the guy.
3188400	3189400	They call him butt man.
3189400	3190400	Like that's a truck.
3190400	3191400	Fuck man.
3191400	3197080	That's a hero's journey because you don't know like you start going like well it's probably
3197080	3200120	hard to be a judge.
3200120	3202960	Like that's the world of common day as Joseph Campbell would call it.
3202960	3206760	It's like it's probably hard to be a judge like these guys I'm sure they all have a big
3206760	3212200	opinion about how they should how things should work and boy they're you know just terrible
3212200	3216080	like hard to deal with and they got nothing to lose and boy what a hard thing it is to
3216080	3217080	be a judge.
3217080	3218080	And then you cross the threshold.
3218080	3223520	It's like the threshold for me is like exactly what the judge goes like you look like a queer
3223520	3228200	and then the guys like it's like it's like well yeah it's difficult as that guy was being
3228200	3232400	like there was like the subtext to it where he's like yeah but if I just keep fucking
3232400	3237120	poking you that's what trolling is he's trolling it and it's just like if I if it's if it's
3237120	3242840	possible for me to go like this enough that you eventually like engage in some crazy ass
3242840	3247960	behavior then everything is retroactively invalidated but it's like you don't deserve
3247960	3251600	to wear a judge's robe because he got him to say like you look like a queer and he's
3251600	3254600	like you call him a queer I didn't say that I said you look like one but it's like he
3254600	3258520	fucking popped his court and he did it in exactly the point where the guy was like you
3258520	3262280	want me to suck your dick and he was like he was like like presiding over things and
3262280	3266160	like bureaucratically like doing his thing because it's like oh this guy wants to suck
3266160	3268600	my dick and all this stuff and then he was like how about you you want to suck my dick
3268600	3272260	and he's like you know what you look like a queer and then the shit went down a crazy
3272260	3276900	road of trials where you're going back and forth like I go back and forth I'm like well
3276900	3280660	okay the judge I'm on the judge's side and then I'm like on the guy's side and I don't
3280660	3285260	know and the god the goddess point is of course like it's at the point where you just think
3285260	3289300	of them as two lovers like you're like these guys are having a good time they're Abbott
3289300	3293340	and Costello like these guys should just live in an apartment together everything's fine
3293340	3297900	and then as you reach that equilibrium the atonement with the father is I'm gonna kill
3298660	3306860	your babies with a hammer and everyone goes silent everyone goes yeah he can't because
3306860	3312100	it's like you can't have Abbott and Costello with that guy he the both the judge and the
3312100	3319140	guy like unwittingly achieved peace on earth by being like these crazy archetypes like
3319140	3323940	that there were more system than man and then the moment that they had equilibrium the guy
3323940	3329020	who has to subvert everything was like yeah well I'm Isis like I'll fucking like I'll like
3329020	3334020	I'll take this to a place where you can't like I don't want the I don't want that warmth I can't
3334020	3338100	have that I like when he says like because there was a moment when they seem to be laughing and
3338100	3343140	having a good time at one point they're clearly going like okay 20 days 40 days 60 days a year
3343140	3347420	10 years like you're in contempt like you're like you're not getting out of jail as you certainly
3347420	3352740	go into trial and then he says I'll kill your whole family okay that's a terrorist threat like
3352740	3357180	that's like a million dollars bond like it's a huge thing to threaten somebody's life especially
3357180	3361700	a judge that's a felony no matter what happened before that including the judge saying all the
3361700	3368020	stupid shit he said at that moment then things become absolutely he doesn't care anymore then
3368020	3373180	they become cathartic because because the guy's going because then the judge is it was previously
3373180	3377340	the judges going well your mouth isn't big enough for my dick or my mouth like they're both like
3377340	3382020	again they're like rolling around in the same mud but when the terrorist threat happens the judge
3382020	3387580	gets back out of the mud and now everything is like washed out and sad it's like a children's
3387580	3391460	book where all the color has drained because you left it in the bathtub like it's the pages are
3391460	3395660	puffy and things are just like they feel like it's been through a fire because then it's just like
3395660	3400380	it's still funny and ironic but it's like now it's sad because it's just like okay now let's go
3400380	3404700	through the motions you're a criminal I'm a judge like like there's nothing fun about this let's
3404700	3409500	keep danger at the door I don't but then it's like then the crazy truth of I don't have a sister I
3409540	3415140	don't have a niece I don't have a wife I don't have anybody I don't have anyone ever I don't have I
3415140	3421220	was born alone I will die alone yes and we don't know he's lying about that I'm timely ripped yes
3421220	3428460	and the fact that he's tracking it to the point like only a sub-editor would when he says why
3428460	3435180	would I have grandkids if I don't have kids we're like wait where why are you tracking this yeah we
3435500	3441580	were you logical he's asking questions than only a person that was like a fan of lost would ask in
3441580	3446700	that moment my favorite moment of lucidity from the defendant is when after he's gotten contempt of
3446700	3451820	court like oh firstly he puts himself in contempt then he earns actual he holds himself into contempt
3451820	3456420	into contempt which yeah which is great it's promethean yeah and then he gets that then he
3456420	3461620	gets held in the courts contempt and he's gonna do time and then he threatens the guy's family
3461620	3466300	okay we're gonna get the DA on this that's a terrorist threat on my family and he doubles
3466300	3470180	down I'm gonna come after your whole family everybody and he's like okay well that's that's
3470180	3477620	a terrorist threat and he goes I don't belong in jail I was framed this lawyer wants to want to
3477620	3482620	suck my dick for a bag of coffee well do you understand though that that's not he's he he's
3482620	3487620	referring to the bag of coffee thing he's referring to the crime so everyone wants to suck this guy's
3487700	3493260	dick he the the reason he has a lawyer we should put in the first place is because a guy wanted
3493260	3498540	to suck his dick for a bag of coffee that he was framed why can't we get this guy's dick on the
3498540	3504580	witness stand he's saying his lawyer wants to suck his dick or he won't represent him so he's
3504580	3509820	just like he's in a you know a cycle of like this guy maybe has a beautiful dick like like we
3509820	3514140	don't know or he looks like he's somebody who would like like maybe we don't know I don't think
3514940	3519020	you suck a beautiful dick for a bag of coffee I think it's his own reward because there's enough
3519020	3523460	racial illusions in the thing I did look it up because it's like I jack off on white boys and
3523460	3528020	there's allusions to like cracker and stuff like he's a white guy he's a this is a white guy just
3528020	3531700	so you know it's like Southern Court I guess it's like you know that's my like he's you know it's
3531700	3537940	like he's like I I jack off on white boys like he's like like he also likes white and he refers
3537940	3541940	to the white boys but it's not weird when you think about it because it's like like oh it's
3541940	3545860	like this we have this we have this like prison system and it's like a class system and it kind
3545860	3552780	of all actually starts to emerge and makes sense funny as parts of that though who's the the woman
3552780	3558620	that animate or do the drawings for that Erica Hayes the cuts to this the court stenographer
3558620	3569580	yeah God that's brilliant yeah he's like I'm just doing my job over here yeah I mean I don't know
3569580	3575220	you know I look I we should we should show another we should show the Rick and Morty clip
3575220	3581980	from the fake this is just a quick look honestly it won't follow that cuz that audio is so clean
3581980	3585860	you understand you're gonna watch an animatic we showed the one from the pickle episode at the
3585860	3592340	panel this is a different thing this is an episode in which it takes place in a post-apocalyptic
3592780	3600020	future like a road warrior type future and they're probably you probably won't you know who knows
3600020	3619460	there's no context it's an animatic all right we satisfied that that end of the agreement we
3619460	3623980	packed us near there by promising Rick and Morty clips and boy we delivered on that certainly
3623980	3629260	nobody could ever sue us for that but I'm really fucking dropping the ball in this community script

5115340	5121660	Deadpool curse no and and i think this is the reason why i hate Deadpool and i just like
5121660	5127180	haul off just right hook and like i put all my energy behind it and normally a puncher have you
5127180	5132780	thrown punches in anger before you know no i've only been in one fight and it was like us like
5132780	5138940	you're six four i believe you said yeah but uh yeah he was six four and like all the pounds
5140540	5146380	and oh wait that's every pound that is every pound every single pound you can have he was
5146380	5152780	like hey nerdy little white ass motherfucker and i and did you take him down well no i threw sand
5152780	5158860	in his eyes all the sand at the can where no no no no this this was at my old high school
5158860	5163580	because we live in the desert wait is this wait what the hell is this chicken like a dead pool guy
5163580	5168700	hold on no no no this oh the first fight was was all the pounds yeah dead pool guy didn't weigh
5168700	5174060	all the pounds no dead pool guy was like oh the first fight you threw sand and and and okay i got
5174060	5180460	it in the shins and ran away okay that's a good move so but that shit still works yeah it does
5180460	5187980	pocket sand anyways dead pool guy like i i give her a solid episode title pocket sand like solid
5187980	5193580	right hook and i lean into it and i fall forward and shit and then like i finally realized what i
5193580	5199980	did and i was like oh shit i need to get out of here because you got an angry conga line on your
5199980	5206540	hands i do a conga line of of guys whose gimmick is having two swords yeah and you know what like
5206620	5211340	i realized what i did and i was like oh shit i gotta get out of the convention when you hit him
5211340	5217260	like you hit him in the face oh yeah and you knocked him down oh i with all the like energy
5217260	5225180	that i had in my body like i was like okay and um and like he hits the ground and then i'm like i
5225180	5232060	was there looking at my food for 10 seconds and he's looking at me or he's not looking at me i
5232140	5237580	don't know what yeah you don't know that's another part of his gimmick yeah then i was like oh shit
5238220	5245580	like comic-con is the only thing i have so i like immediately walk out and then uh about two years
5245580	5249740	before that some guy got stabbed in the eye by a pencil right we were talking about that early
5249740	5255020	yeah that was crazy shit wait is that you you can't do that wait wait wait back to your story
5255020	5259100	we'll read the newspaper about the pencil thing yeah yeah yeah yeah anyways what is it what what
5259100	5265420	you want you knocked a Deadpool the fuck out and just walked out because you said comic-con
5265420	5270700	is all i have and you just walked out because comic-con was all i had like now you can't come
5270700	5274780	back because here's a Deadpool killer but you have come back you don't know what happened to
5274780	5283340	the Deadpool guy no i mean if you're out here i apologize no no it's not here i think the odds
5283420	5289100	that are low possibly it'd be amazing if he came up it was like i fucking thought it would be very
5289100	5294140	dead poolian of me to knock your sandwich out of your hand and i'm so sorry that you got here but
5294140	5298300	he has a tattoo of three chicken nuggets on his shoulder and he's like i've come to kill you
5299500	5303900	like he's got a teardrop on his okay well that's i mean i i really thank you for sharing that
5303900	5310940	that's a truly dark comic-con moment i thank you joseph everybody joseph have a wonderful convention
5310940	5315100	everybody thank you joseph that's that's that's that's interesting because you have a mix of
5315100	5320620	people walking around you don't know their story some people we come here to to surrender to a
5320620	5326060	bigger thing than ourselves like being a nerd is about obsession it's about acquiescence to mythology
5326060	5330940	people are dressed up as these things and i i remember one of my first comic-con memories
5330940	5339580	uh was seeing uh there were two friends one was dressed as uh uh john luke pakar captain and the
5339900	5348860	his friend was old school kirk captain and the kirk was having he was on the floor like he was
5348860	5354540	having an episode like like and and the and the john luke pakart guy was like cradling him and
5354540	5358700	going like can i they weren't doing a bit there was like but there was like like there were just
5358700	5363900	two old friends and like one of them was having like an actual heart attack and anyways all right
5364780	5369340	all right so the light side of comic-con mine's really happy what is your name by design
5370060	5377340	my name is laura hello laura what's your what's your yeah what's the other side i i'm happy now
5377340	5381660	because kind of a bridge of where i started i started coming to comic-con eight years ago
5381660	5388540	with my dad and my cousin and my uncles and we're all really into the same stuff and we'd park our
5388540	5394220	car at the marriot across the street and we'd pack a cooler full of beer and sandwiches and
5394220	5399340	we'd all meet and drink in the parking lot oh my god look what book i found well i met this guy and
5399340	5403500	oh and i found this signature oh my god well i think i read his book and it was so exciting
5403500	5408700	and it was kind of just this new universe that was opening up and then i moved here to san diego
5409340	5415660	partially because i liked it because i visited for comic-con and i struggled for a long time
5415660	5420700	being unemployed and then i got a job with the newspaper here the san diego union tribune
5420700	5425340	and now i don't have to read the schedule because it gets emailed to me and i get invited to these
5425340	5431340	cool press things and i interviewed um feral audio yesterday dan you were supposed to be there
5431340	5437180	but you were double booked no double booked that's the bummer um i was punching a guy that took my
5438220	5444300	chicken sandwich oh but it's just so exciting because i've watched it grown and then in
5444380	5449500	reflection i can stare at it and go oh and it's watched me grow and it's just exciting
5449500	5454540	i feel at home at comic-con it's like a mecca for you you came and got absorbed by it
5455580	5460940	that is a that's good so yeah it's a it's a goddess that gives with one hand and takes
5460940	5467820	with the other comic i don't know what my point was i just thought we could explore that and we
