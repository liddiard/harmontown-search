0	7000	What's up, Harbontown?
7000	12000	Hello, hello, hello.
12000	22000	You know, I'm going to start it from here.
22000	27000	Welcome to beautiful uptown Burbank, everybody.
27000	37000	Harbontown is now excited.
37000	46000	Speaking of Spencer, let's bring out your Game Master Spencer Crichton.
46000	50000	And of course, if you're Comptroller, I'm very happy to be back with Jeff Davis.
50000	59000	Let's bring out the man of the hour, the Mayor of Harbontown, Dennis!
59000	62000	Thank you, thank you.
62000	65000	Not a lot to talk about tonight.
65000	72000	There was a gunman at large in Las Feliz last night, two nights ago.
72000	77000	I never heard what the denouement of that was.
77000	82000	I don't think they caught him, and I don't think they ever told anybody what was going on.
82000	87000	So I think maybe it was some kind of soylink green or body snatchers thing,
87000	91000	like maybe the guy knew too much.
91000	96000	They either did or didn't catch him, but in either case, they can't tell us what happened.
96000	97000	Do you think it was Antifa?
97000	99000	It could have been Antifa.
99000	102000	You're looking very smart in your bright red Cornell hoodie.
102000	107000	Thank you. I just got back from Ithaca, New York, and they gave me this hoodie.
107000	111000	I thought it was a mistake to give me a women's studies degree.
111000	121000	I don't know if I earned that, but as Susan B. Anthony says, fuck it.
121000	123000	Because I didn't earn the degree.
123000	127000	Did they make you an honorary doctor of anything? Did they give you any fake morals?
127000	130000	No.
130000	133000	How does that work when you get an honorary degree in something?
133000	135000	You can't use it for anything, right?
135000	138000	It must be watermarked honorary.
138000	141000	Yeah, I think they say honorarium.
141000	143000	You can't just use it to go get a job.
143000	144000	You can try.
144000	147000	But red's kind of a nice color on your den. I've never seen you wear bright red.
147000	149000	Yeah, I don't wear a lot of red.
149000	151000	Yeah, I like it.
151000	155000	Also, wearing a Cornell hoodie, you look very collegiate.
155000	159000	You look like you might have just taught poli sci, right?
159000	163000	Yeah, I had a good time at that school. I guess that's a gig now that I can do.
163000	168000	I hit some kind of tipping point where I can get invited to speak at colleges.
168000	178000	The ratio of money to labor, which is zero labor, and you're just talking to people that want it.
178000	180000	It was just a dude asking me questions.
180000	184000	It was just doing this show, but worse.
184000	188000	It wasn't as entertaining, but they were eating it up.
188000	190000	And you were in that big, beautiful theater there.
190000	193000	Yeah, it was a gorgeous theater. Everybody was really nice.
193000	196000	I just laughed at everything I said.
196000	198000	Were they too PC?
198000	201000	I hear that's a problem.
201000	205000	No, nothing of that sort came up, really.
205000	207000	It was just a lot of questions about writing and stuff.
208000	213000	TV is dispersed enough now as an industry.
213000	220000	There's less money in it, but now that there's 500,000 places to make television,
220000	227000	it's kind of satisfying to see these kids are talking about TV like it's carpentry or something.
227000	229000	It's a viable occupation now.
229000	233000	If it's viable enough, if it's achievable enough, then that's going to mean very quickly,
233000	242000	hopefully, the representational problems that we have will get sorted out pretty fast
242000	248000	as soon as you can actually think about TV writing as a potential job.
248000	251000	The problem is, how the fuck is it?
251000	255000	You're making even less money now.
255000	259000	There's more places to try to sell your TV show.
260000	264000	Everybody's questions, they're all taking these TV writing classes and stuff,
264000	269000	and everybody's questions are all, how? What do I do?
269000	273000	I don't really have the answers for those kids.
273000	280000	I'm not somebody that took a normal path through the system.
280000	282000	I don't like me.
282000	283000	Yeah.
283000	285000	Spencer, you got a show.
285000	289000	I would say you took the most time-honored of all the trajectories to enjoy your work.
289000	294000	I kept my head down, I just put one foot in front of the other, did the work.
294000	298000	Spencer started running.
298000	303000	Yeah, I hadn't really talked about it on the podcast because I didn't want to break the spell,
303000	306000	but now I've basically stopped running so we could talk about it.
306000	309000	For a while, Spencer was tweeting there, I jagged 15 miles today.
309000	314000	I read those, the first one or two of those I thought was a little bit of irony,
314000	317000	or like you were being facetious, but no, you're really getting it done.
317000	321000	And that was only after I was confident enough in my skills to actually publicize it.
321000	323000	I was going for quite a while before I was doing that.
323000	325000	Are you in a treadmill or are you out in the streets?
325000	328000	No, I was on Griffith Park, out in Griffith Park, running around in a big circle.
328000	330000	Is that why your back is all jacked up by now?
330000	332000	Yeah, that's what I think.
332000	335000	Yeah, so your knee exploded, right?
335000	337000	Yeah, it's no good.
337000	340000	I'm going to get a drink while you...
340000	346000	There was a time that I was jogging, and then when I'd be driving, my knees would hurt.
346000	348000	And...
348000	350000	So, okay.
350000	355000	Oh, for some reason I thought that Chris is making that noise, but it's a soundboard.
355000	360000	Zach McKeever, our sound guru, told me to get some sound effects because we have no audience.
360000	362000	That's a bad fart sound.
362000	365000	I mean, I guess it's like a free app fart sound.
365000	368000	That's a sound? That's a professional sound.
369000	372000	See, that's so bad.
372000	374000	I mean, yeah.
374000	377000	No, it's fine. I'm just insulting the...
377000	379000	See, this is bad quality.
379000	381000	See, that one's called nose.
381000	384000	That's someone blowing their nose, but that sounds like a better fart, doesn't it?
384000	385000	Right, yeah, no.
385000	387000	It definitely sounds like a better fart.
387000	390000	We've got to get you some good Foley artists to work with.
390000	391000	Oh, my God, we do.
391000	394000	You should get a Foley artist instead of soundboard.
395000	400000	You should have fallen on old-timey radio shows, Foley guys.
400000	402000	We could put him under your podium.
402000	406000	This story is going somewhere because Spencer hurt his knee, his back.
406000	411000	Yeah, so just while driving, it would hurt my knee while I was driving.
411000	414000	And then I was like, oh, driving is fucking up my knee, and I kept running.
414000	419000	But I think that running was fucking up my knee, and I was only feeling it while I was driving
419000	422000	until it got so bad that I felt it after I was running.
422000	425000	And then I was like, oh, I bet I'm fucking myself up.
425000	426000	And it was bad.
426000	430000	And so then again, it was only hurt when I sit and when I was driving,
430000	433000	and it would be the worst because I drive for work and also I drive for recreation.
433000	437000	I would say I drive between two and three hours a day, most days,
437000	440000	and most of that's just for fun, you know?
440000	441000	And so it got...
441000	443000	You just get out on the open road and just...
443000	446000	Oh, yeah, blasting doughboys.
446000	448000	It's a real fun time.
448000	450000	So you went to get...
450000	453000	Well, I went to the doctor, but the day I went to the doctor,
453000	456000	then I started getting what I think is sciatica pain,
456000	460000	which is like on the side of your lower back, it feels like a nerve pinch.
460000	462000	It goes down your ass, cheek, and down into your...
462000	463000	Yeah.
463000	466000	I would feel it right under my ass and then in my foot.
466000	467000	And it was like really bad.
467000	470000	And so I went to see the doctor, and he was like, oh, it's just inflammation.
470000	473000	And I was like, well, there's this new thing that's coming up,
473000	474000	and he was like, sciatica?
474000	475000	And I was like, I don't know what that is.
475000	477000	And he was like, it's like your leg's burning?
477000	479000	And I was like, well, no.
479000	480000	And I was like, okay.
480000	482000	But then I looked it up after I left, and I was like, well, fuck, no,
482000	483000	that was what I had.
483000	484000	He described it wrong.
484000	488000	Yeah, if he had said a tingling or almost like an electrical pain,
488000	491000	going shooting down your leg,
491000	495000	starting somewhere in your ass cheek and then going down,
495000	496000	I had that really bad.
496000	498000	I thought I was going to have to live with that forever.
498000	499000	What'd you do?
499000	500000	Nothing?
500000	503000	Well, the first thing that fixed it was an inversion table.
503000	504000	Oh, right.
504000	506000	And then it started coming back,
506000	508000	and I may have fucked up my back more with the inversion table.
509000	512000	I was evangelizing inversion tables for a while.
513000	518000	Then McGathey had gone to some chiropractor,
518000	521000	and that's Dr.
521000	523000	God, his name is Dr. Phil.
523000	524000	Oh, yeah.
524000	525000	Oh, no.
525000	526000	And he doesn't like inversion tables?
526000	528000	Well, no, of course not.
528000	529000	He likes chiropractic.
529000	532000	Dan, I hear that in the medical community,
532000	535000	Dr. Phil is known as something of a...
536000	539000	Oh, yeah.
539000	542000	I've taken this shit to a new level.
542000	544000	People thought when we lost the audience,
544000	546000	the show was going to suffer showbiz-wise.
546000	548000	No, we're reaching untold heights.
548000	550000	Yeah, this is true.
550000	552000	But you could have done that when there was an audience here.
552000	554000	I know.
554000	559000	We're like, we're evolving while the audience isn't here.
559000	561000	It's kind of like being in a cocoon.
561000	562000	An opportunity.
562000	563000	Yeah.
563000	565000	So while the knee pain was bad,
565000	567000	this nerve pain was unbearable,
567000	569000	and it came on a lot faster.
569000	572000	And so I was like, I can't sit, which is a big part of my job.
572000	575000	I can't drive, which is a bigger part of my job.
575000	576000	I'm really freaking out.
576000	577000	And then I couldn't run.
577000	580000	So it's like everything that I had been doing with my life,
580000	582000	I just all of a sudden couldn't do.
582000	584000	And I was like, what am I doing with my life?
584000	586000	And so I talked to Brian Lofada,
586000	589000	and he was like, my brother does traditional Chinese medicine.
589000	591000	You should see someone like that.
591000	592000	And then I was like, acupuncture?
592000	593000	And he was like, sure.
593000	596000	And so I was like, you know who does acupuncture?
596000	597000	Steve Agee.
597000	599000	And he also has terrible health.
599000	602000	So I asked him what the deal was,
602000	604000	and he recommended me to an acupuncturist.
604000	606000	And I was like, yeah, because I got this sciatica.
606000	607000	And he was like, holy shit.
607000	609000	They really did wonders on my sciatica.
609000	612000	And I was like, oh, yeah, jackpot.
612000	615000	And so I went like two or three days later.
615000	617000	That's the thing is that I was scheduling these doctor's
617000	619000	appointments, and it's like, we could see you in two weeks
619000	620000	or whatever the fuck.
620000	622000	And then the acupuncturists are like, yeah, come in tomorrow.
622000	623000	Like, come in the next day.
623000	624000	And I was like, hell, yeah.
624000	627000	So it was great, because at this point, it was like another week
627000	629000	or so before I'd get another doctor appointment.
629000	631000	And I was in terrible pain.
631000	633000	So I go to the acupuncturist.
633000	635000	I couldn't sit down.
635000	638000	The drive over to the acupuncturist was like torture.
638000	640000	It was really, really bad.
640000	642000	And by the time I was out of the car,
642000	644000	I was like, I don't want to sit back down.
644000	647000	And so I filled out the paperwork standing up.
647000	649560	And then they brought me into this room
649560	654440	that had all this weird new age music and relaxing music
654440	659120	and a little steamy thing making vaporizing water into the air.
659120	661400	And they laid me down onto a table.
661400	665000	And I think this is part of it.
665000	666880	They cultivate an air of mystique.
666880	668560	They don't tell you anything.
668560	671600	And there is things that I took as maybe cold reading
671600	672440	techniques.
672440	674060	She was like, you don't drink enough water.
674060	675560	And I was like, I drink a ton of water.
675560	678840	And she was like, I don't know.
678840	681520	But I actually didn't drink any water that day.
681520	685480	And when I peed after I left and my pee was like neon yellow.
685480	687960	And I was like, wow, she really was right.
687960	689600	So they didn't tell me what I was doing.
689600	692240	She just started stabbing needles into my back.
692240	695320	And it hurt really bad.
695320	699120	They go, I mean, not really bad, I mean, worse than a shot.
699120	700320	But they poke it.
700320	702360	And then I don't know why they do it.
702360	704240	But they kind of push it in further
704240	707000	or kind of twist it around or something.
707000	709320	I think she was trying to hit a nerve or whatever.
709320	711360	Because then sometimes she would stab it right
711360	712720	into what felt like a nerve.
712720	715240	And then it would just shoot lightning down my body.
715240	717480	And I was like, you're trying to stay still.
717480	719360	But your whole body's jerking because someone's
719360	721960	stabbing you with fucking needles into your nerves,
721960	725320	which are the things that are supposed to feel things the most.
725320	726560	It was really crazy.
726560	728440	So she put the needles in.
728440	732080	And then she left me for a while and just left.
732080	734880	And then she came back.
734880	737920	And then she attached the wires to the needles
737920	739840	and was like, tell me when you feel it.
739840	741000	And I was like, I don't feel it.
741000	742480	And she was like, tell me when you feel it.
742480	743800	And I'm like, what am I supposed to feel?
743800	745040	And she was like, you'll know.
745040	748460	And then eventually it started feeling
748460	751920	like someone was rattling the little needles because
751920	753000	of the electrical shock.
753000	755360	I don't know if it was jiggling the needles or whatever.
755360	758760	So now I'm getting electricity sent through these needles
758760	760880	that's stabbed into my nerves.
761880	763800	And she turned up the power pretty high
763800	764840	because I wasn't feeling it.
764840	766520	And she was like, oh, you're a strong guy.
766520	768040	And I was like, I don't know.
768040	769440	I have a low pain tolerance.
769440	771480	This is pretty painful to be stabbed.
771480	773440	I'm just not feeling the lightning.
773440	774760	So then she turned on the lightning.
774760	777080	And it was just zapping my body.
777080	780800	And it was making my muscles twitch and stuff.
780800	782420	And she's like, just hang out here.
782420	783720	And I was like, for how long?
783720	785640	And it felt like 20 minutes, just
785640	790200	with this machine buzzing and just vibrating my body.
791200	793920	It was making my nerves light up and glow.
793920	796120	It was really crazy.
796120	798200	But it felt like it was doing something
798200	802520	because those very same nerves that were in terrible pain
802520	804980	were the ones that are now buzzing with electricity
804980	806280	and stuff.
806280	808440	It felt like something was happening.
808440	811000	And then eventually the machine finished
811000	813280	and it made this crazy beeping sound as she came back in
813280	814480	and she took it all off.
814480	815840	And then I didn't know this was going
815840	817840	to happen because, again, there's no communication.
817840	820640	It just basically shows up and starts doing stuff.
820640	822600	And she starts cupping me.
822600	824260	You guys know about cupping?
824260	824760	Oh, yeah.
824760	825840	I do now, yeah.
825840	826560	Yeah.
826560	828920	Yeah, I'm sure you do.
828920	832360	Cupping is so weird it better work.
832360	833000	Yeah.
833000	833800	I don't know.
833800	835680	She cupped me basically on the same,
835680	836640	if you don't know what cupping is,
836640	838240	it's like a suction cup that they put.
838240	840480	And then they use a balloon pump or some shit
840480	841640	to suck all the air of it.
841640	843960	So now your skin is sucking up.
843960	854320	I thought the artisanal way of doing that is they put a fire.
854320	855160	A match in there.
855160	855660	Yeah.
855660	856560	And then, yeah.
856560	857060	Right.
857060	859600	But she was just using what sounded like a balloon pump.
859600	861920	You can't see because they put you face down at its table
861920	864800	and you're looking through a toilet seat at a chair that's
864800	865800	below your face.
865800	867920	And you don't know anything that they're doing.
867920	872800	You just assume it's not make placebo magic.
873440	875160	Yeah, so she cupped me in all these spots.
875160	878360	And that was really painful.
878360	880560	As bad as it is to be stabbed with needles
880560	883000	that are shooting lightning through your body,
883000	884520	being cupped was really bad.
884520	889680	Are you going to be mad at Levy if I saw the photo?
889680	890840	No, I know that happened.
890840	893320	You could have just asked, man.
893320	894880	I'm the victim of revenge porn.
898880	901080	Well, I didn't.
901720	902840	Levy had it on his phone.
902840	903360	No, I know.
903360	904360	And he was like, oh, shit.
904360	905600	And I saw it.
905600	909240	And then I just, I'm not usually a,
909240	913560	it was just like the airdrop thing came up.
913560	915720	And I just before I even knew what I was doing,
915720	916400	I just hit it.
916400	918760	It was just like, well, I don't know.
918760	919480	It was just there.
919480	922400	Yeah, that's not your fault of an airdrop window box.
922400	923360	Well, no, it was.
923360	925520	I mean, maybe it's because I hit the share button.
925520	926400	I don't know.
926400	927400	Oh, well, yeah, OK.
927400	929160	Well, that's what the story was.
929160	929680	Yeah.
929920	931120	So you definitely didn't.
931120	932960	I didn't know what I was doing.
932960	934880	I was just like, well, this seems like a valuable photo.
934880	936440	I wasn't going to show it to anybody else.
936440	939800	I just, yeah, I really don't know why that was my instinct.
939800	943840	But you wouldn't show it to the viewers, would you?
943840	946200	No, what's embarrassing about that picture
946200	949400	is not like it's everything but the cupping marks.
949400	952480	Like I have weird acne scars on my back and then stretch
952480	954360	marks and like way too much hair.
954360	956320	Like I took the picture and I was like, man,
956320	959880	I wish that my skin was better because these cupping scars
959880	960760	are crazy.
960760	962280	This is like a gross picture.
962280	966600	Well, so anyways, I then take our word for it,
966600	970040	Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea.
970040	974360	Like it's fucking like you can see cupping pictures online.
974360	977040	It looks exactly like it's just except on my ass.
977040	980560	It's like giant hickies, the diameter of a softball.
980560	982400	Yeah, I mean, like a wine glass.
982560	986160	What's the idea is it's drawing toxins out of your bloodstream?
986160	987320	That's what they said.
987320	989120	She was like, it's turning color.
989120	991880	That means it's working because it takes stuff out of you.
991880	994760	And it's like it's turning color because all the oxygen
994760	997680	is being rushed out of my skin to the surface of the skin
997680	1000080	because of a vast pressure differential.
1000080	1002240	It has nothing to do with toxins.
1002240	1005400	But it felt like anti-acupuncture
1005400	1007240	because they were stabbing me before.
1007240	1008920	And then those same spots they stabbed me,
1008920	1011040	they were then sucking air.
1011720	1013120	I don't know if it was like.
1013120	1015440	But they look just like bruises.
1015440	1019520	When you touch them, do they hurt as much as a bruise?
1019520	1021000	That size would hurt?
1021000	1022040	One of them kind of hurts.
1022040	1023640	The rest don't really feel like anything.
1023640	1024480	That's interesting.
1024480	1025320	Yeah.
1025320	1028920	Because it looks like a straight up like paint ball bruise.
1028920	1029760	Even worse, really.
1029760	1031480	Just like deep purple.
1031480	1032320	Yeah.
1032320	1033920	It was really painful.
1033920	1036080	It's like if you know you get an Indian burn,
1036080	1038520	like they twist your skin on your arm or whatever.
1038520	1040640	It felt like that for like 10 minutes
1040640	1042080	while the cups were on my back.
1042080	1043080	It was really bad.
1043080	1045600	But also they were making my muscles twitch
1045600	1046440	with the lightning.
1046440	1048920	And so then like the muscles that were twitching
1048920	1051840	just felt like I had exercised them to death.
1051840	1054840	Like they felt dead and really, really, really sore.
1054840	1057240	And so then by the time it was finished,
1057240	1061360	I didn't feel like it wasn't crazy, vast nerve pain.
1061360	1064320	Like I still felt that nerve like acting up,
1064320	1067080	but it just kind of felt like my ass was sore.
1067080	1069040	And then I was like, wow, that's really crazy.
1069080	1070880	And so yeah, then I drove home
1070880	1073240	and I wasn't in terrible pain on the trip home,
1073240	1076000	which was the same journey, you know, the same length trip.
1076000	1077840	And then the next day I felt a lot better.
1077840	1079400	And then the next day I felt a lot better.
1079400	1081280	And today I feel basically nothing.
1081280	1083280	I was like driving around all today.
1083280	1085360	You can kind of feel it a little bit coming in
1085360	1087320	after about an hour of driving.
1087320	1089080	You feel nothing as in a good thing.
1089080	1090840	You're not numb.
1090840	1091680	Yeah.
1091680	1092520	Wow.
1092520	1093880	Now I was told, cause I had a little sciatica
1093880	1096480	like pain a while back and I was told,
1096480	1100160	and it instantly worked is do sit-ups, do ab stuff.
1100160	1101000	Yeah.
1101000	1103480	The one thing I looked up online was this one stretch
1103480	1104800	where you put your leg on a chair
1104800	1106320	and then you kind of pull your toe inward.
1106320	1108400	And I kept doing that and I think it was helping.
1108400	1109600	There was one time I was driving
1109600	1111840	and I had to like stop driving and get out of the car.
1111840	1113280	And then I just walked around for a bit
1113280	1114520	and then stretched my leg like that
1114520	1116360	until I could get back in and it was no good.
1116360	1119400	Here's the tough thing about back pain is,
1119400	1124120	it, you know, your story is about, you know,
1124120	1127760	the doctor said it's inflammation and he could,
1127760	1130440	it could just be that he was right.
1130440	1132440	He wasn't talking about the sciatica at all
1132440	1134320	because like he didn't know that was happening
1134320	1135920	or, you know, he didn't understand it was happening.
1135920	1139760	Well anyways, I mean, it's like, it could have been
1139760	1142240	because it could have been something pushing.
1142240	1143080	It probably was.
1143080	1144440	Pushing your sciatic nerve.
1144440	1146520	And then that, that just got reduced.
1146520	1149320	And now we don't know if acupuncture works.
1149320	1150160	Right.
1150160	1152200	That's the thing is that anytime I do anything like that,
1152200	1153880	I always have to ask is like,
1153920	1155200	if I didn't do anything,
1155200	1158960	wouldn't I also improve to an extent over time anyway?
1158960	1159920	But I don't know.
1159920	1160760	When I talked to Steve,
1160760	1162680	he said he got it for really long bursts
1162680	1164580	and it didn't feel like it was going away.
1164580	1166000	But then after that treatment,
1166000	1167660	it just instantly started going away.
1167660	1170040	So I don't know, but I mean, you know,
1170040	1172720	not like intuitively, I don't know.
1172720	1176580	I will say now that I've been going to this chiropractor
1176580	1178120	for as long as I have,
1178120	1181600	I can definitely scientifically say comparing it
1181600	1184680	to 40 years of other back treatments.
1184680	1185520	Yeah.
1185520	1187880	Of, of, of, of going to different chiropractors
1187880	1190320	and then not going to them or the inversion table
1190320	1192880	and stuff like whatever my chiropractor is doing
1192880	1195200	is actually, it has me pain free.
1195200	1197000	I really thought my, my whole family,
1197000	1199680	it's the one thing that we have as a weakness
1199680	1201720	on both sides of my family.
1201720	1204900	Like we have really strong tooth enamel,
1205420	1210420	strong toenails, strong hearts, lungs,
1212980	1214260	everything's, you know,
1214260	1217640	we don't have a lot of like streaks of like proclivities,
1217640	1220460	you know, for, for ailment going through my family tree.
1220460	1222940	We just kind of drink ourselves to death or smoke.
1222940	1225060	Do you find that the strong toenails has benefited you
1225060	1226280	and your family?
1226280	1228380	Well, Cody was just pointing that out the other day.
1228380	1231540	I was like, she was like, wow, you must, you, you, you,
1231540	1232660	you must be really healthy.
1232660	1234740	Like these, these disgusting toenails
1234740	1238580	that you need to clip immediately are really like,
1238580	1240100	I don't know what, they're, they're, they're not,
1240100	1241860	they're not flimsy and jaundiced.
1241860	1243780	They're like eagle talons.
1243780	1245380	Exactly.
1245380	1247920	If you're just joining us, I'm gross.
1249340	1251340	But if you haven't seen Dan swoop through your neighborhood
1251340	1253900	and catch a squirrel, it's amazing.
1253900	1255140	I'm also a bad person.
1255140	1258940	So last time I was on this stage, I made fun of,
1258940	1260860	yeah, I think that's a good description.
1260860	1265860	I made fun of, of, uh, the podcast, uh, uh, up and
1265860	1269340	vanished hosted by pain, Lindsay, who, you know,
1269340	1272140	I just kind of characterized him as a, as a guy that, you
1272140	1273580	know, he doesn't know what he's doing.
1273580	1275220	He didn't know what he was doing.
1275220	1277020	He learns what he's doing, but then he,
1277020	1278860	but it's just like a podcast about him going like,
1278860	1280820	I don't know how to, I want to do have a try.
1280820	1281660	I don't know.
1281660	1283060	I kind of, I kind of made fun of him.
1283060	1285180	I don't think I was like high fiving him.
1285180	1287540	I don't think I was that flattering.
1287540	1292540	And then tonight I saw that he, he tweeted, like he,
1293140	1295140	it was clear that he had heard the thing cause he made,
1295140	1297180	cause I said, he sounded like Chris Pratt and he said,
1297180	1299180	so he tweeted, I saw a tweet from him and said, well,
1299180	1300540	at least I sound like Chris Pratt.
1300540	1304020	And then, and then I think they had an emoji that was like
1304020	1306100	kind of like a guy with a hand over his face or something
1306100	1306940	like that.
1306940	1307780	Like he was embarrassed.
1307780	1310140	Cause I, cause then I, cause he, I, I,
1310140	1313660	Cody looked him, looked him up, you know, and you know,
1313660	1316180	he's just, he's just an adorable guy.
1316220	1319340	You know, he loves his wife and like he's, he did,
1319340	1322060	he did a good true crime podcast and then I made fun of him
1322060	1323740	and I didn't want him to hear it.
1323740	1325220	It's doesn't, it's, you know, you know,
1325220	1326900	that some shit had like,
1326900	1329180	yeah, someone just probably told him, like, like, like,
1329180	1330780	like couldn't resist, you know,
1330780	1333140	I just don't understand that instance that felt the need
1333140	1337260	to Ron Jeremy to track down Ron Jeremy's Reddit.
1337260	1338100	Yeah.
1338100	1341740	I still maintain that that guy though, if he's listening,
1341740	1343820	I, I didn't realize a good person.
1343820	1345900	I didn't really think that that guy, no,
1346500	1348340	the guy that went to run Jeremy, I didn't, I didn't,
1348340	1353260	I didn't feel like that guy was, was really trying to cause
1353260	1354100	B for.
1354100	1356740	It's just weird that like you say something like, I mean,
1356740	1358420	it's stupid to think that what we're doing here is,
1358420	1359260	is in a vacuum.
1359260	1362220	Of course, what we say, we'll send out butterfly effects
1362220	1367220	and all this shit, but it's just like everything we say
1367220	1370860	can reach its unintended targets and probably will.
1370860	1373340	And maybe, maybe, maybe paid Lindsay is whether it was
1373340	1375380	already a listener, which would be rad.
1375820	1377740	You know, he's a, he's a, he's a fun guy.
1377740	1378860	He'd make a great guest.
1378860	1379860	We should have on the show.
1379860	1382300	Maybe we should get Ron Jeremy in the show.
1382300	1384140	Get to the bottom of that shit.
1384140	1386180	Well, we did get to the bottom of it.
1386180	1388060	I think we have to go straight to the source.
1388060	1390620	That would be amazing if we got him on the show.
1390620	1392660	We were interviewing and we're like, well, I gotta ask.
1392660	1394700	I gotta ask what's with the, what's with the,
1394700	1396020	what's with the banana peel?
1396020	1399620	And he's like, he has every right to say,
1399620	1400900	I don't know what you're talking about.
1400900	1402180	Maybe I was drunk and doing a joke.
1402180	1405100	Like he might just like, just like throw that away.
1405700	1407020	Like so many banana peels.
1407020	1407860	Oh shit.
1407860	1409060	Yeah, he would have a right to do that,
1409060	1411100	but that would make him a big liar because when,
1411100	1412340	when the person said it to him,
1412340	1416860	he, he had a very quick response that he knew exactly what
1416860	1417860	that person was talking about.
1417860	1419580	I think he had a fallback.
1419580	1422900	I think when somebody goes on his Reddit and asks him
1422900	1425580	a specific questions, he has a cute answer.
1425580	1427980	That's very convenient.
1427980	1429060	But in the moment you, he,
1429060	1431580	I think he had ulterior motives that were way more
1431580	1432700	complicated in the moment.
1432700	1433580	It could be both.
1433660	1436340	I think that's giving him too much credit for being clever
1436340	1439140	to say like he has all these versions of how to deal
1439140	1440980	with people asking him about a banana peel.
1440980	1445980	Did we talk about my conversation with David Keith?
1446860	1447700	Keith David.
1447700	1448940	Keith, I always do that.
1448940	1450980	Keith David about cross mounted pussy.
1453500	1455220	We've talked about on the show, I believe, right?
1455220	1458860	Yeah, I mean, it's been going on for so long.
1458860	1461020	I can't, I can't remember.
1461020	1462980	When he was on Ricking Morty,
1463900	1466100	like I think the last Ricking Morty, right?
1468660	1470620	Maybe we're repeating old news here,
1470620	1475300	but there's a line in the movie Platoon that Keith David
1475300	1478100	says and he refers to going back,
1478100	1481100	sniffing that cross mounted pussy down by the river.
1481100	1484180	And Matt Gorley and I from Super Ego fame
1484180	1487820	and Harmon Quest fame have really tried to get to the bottom
1487820	1489700	of what is cross mounted pussy?
1489700	1491580	Why is it cross mounted?
1491580	1495340	What are the pros and cons of it being cross mounted?
1495340	1498140	And Dan worked with him on community a couple of times
1498140	1500900	and you asked him and you didn't get a satisfactory answer
1500900	1501740	to that.
1501740	1502580	No.
1502580	1504500	He was so nice when I met him.
1504500	1505980	I was wearing this exact same suit
1505980	1507540	with a kind of a little window pane check
1507540	1509260	and he was wearing a similar suit.
1509260	1511580	There's a photo that I have, I think, on my instant noodles
1511580	1515180	and he was so pleasant.
1515180	1517140	I go, okay, I'm gonna be that guy
1517140	1519540	and I'm gonna ask you about Platoon.
1519700	1521180	I got some Platoon questions where he's like,
1521180	1522340	lay them on me.
1522340	1524260	And we talked and talked and talked about
1524260	1526220	cross mounted pussy and we finally came to the conclusion
1526220	1527620	and he goes, look man, I don't know,
1527620	1529620	that was some Oliver Stone shit.
1529620	1531700	He just said that was, I was just reading my lines.
1531700	1532820	Oh yeah.
1532820	1537380	So the answer is we don't know.
1537380	1540580	So now, I don't wanna have to deal with Oliver Stone
1540580	1542780	about this issue because he's gonna do a Ron Jeremy
1542780	1545440	and have some fucking terse, convenient answer
1545440	1547460	that doesn't satisfy me or anybody else.
1547900	1550900	Why can't you believe that that's his line?
1550900	1553580	Because here's the thing, it's like you're expecting it
1553580	1555260	to be something dirty, I think.
1555260	1557940	Because it's like a banana and so the fact that it's not,
1557940	1560460	that's like, it's a brilliant move.
1560460	1562340	What I think it was, I think he had a banana peel
1562340	1563180	on my shoulder.
1563180	1564780	I don't think he had a clever line ready to go
1564780	1567340	or a dirty line, like a salacious,
1567340	1569780	like rejoinder when somebody asked him about it.
1569780	1571180	I do know that he seemed bummed out
1571180	1573940	when a guy asked him about it from behind his back.
1573940	1576100	So that leads me in that direction.
1576140	1578460	But I think that maybe he was just doing that.
1578460	1579940	I think he was in a bad mood.
1581180	1582500	No, come on, we've been over this.
1582500	1585020	We've got this figured out from top to bottom.
1585020	1590020	It's a thing that he does if he sees a banana peel,
1590500	1593300	he puts it, he does that.
1593300	1596780	It's one of maybe five things that he has up his sleeve
1596780	1601780	and he likes to be funny for probably for the girls
1602780	1606380	and didn't want to be vulnerable with you
1606380	1610060	and was like, yeah, I mean,
1610060	1612140	you just saw a weird side of him.
1612140	1614020	Yeah, I think then he takes a banana peel.
1614020	1616460	When you ask him if you're a woman,
1616460	1618220	why are you wearing a banana peel,
1618220	1621600	I think it ends up with somehow pussy being cross mounted.
1623180	1624620	And I think the cross mounted pussy is like,
1624620	1625980	it's holy, it's holy pussy.
1625980	1628500	It's like on a cross, it's like Christ pussy.
1628500	1630140	Oh shit, yeah.
1630140	1631300	It's like the best pussy.
1631300	1633180	That was one of our theories we talked about.
1633180	1636060	That's probably a cross mounted pussy.
1636060	1640140	Gross, if you love a pussy, don't crucify it.
1640140	1642460	That's about it, it's Shrobs birthday.
1642460	1643300	Oh yeah.
1643300	1645780	He's not here, he's off somewhere.
1645780	1649460	But I do, I have to, for Shrobs leaves town tomorrow
1649460	1651300	and he goes back to Milwaukee
1651300	1654260	and he's going to speak at his alma mater,
1654260	1655460	if I'm using that term right,
1655460	1656820	the place he graduated from,
1656820	1658900	the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
1659740	1664740	And he wanted me to do like an introduction on video forum.
1665860	1670220	So I guess we could knock that out right now
1670220	1672820	because you're able to, in addition to live streaming it,
1672820	1674500	you can like also, yeah, you'll have it
1674500	1676700	and then I can just give them a clip, right?
1677940	1678980	Do you want some music for this, Dan?
1678980	1680880	Or is it, you want to go dry?
1682860	1683940	What do you have?
1683940	1685420	I mean, just the regular shit.
1685420	1686700	You want to beat, you want to rap it out?
1686700	1687820	What do you got?
1687820	1688660	Sure, sure.
1688660	1689480	Well, let's start, yeah,
1689480	1692200	let's try a Rob Shrobs introduction rap.
1697900	1699300	Can you pump that up, sir?
1701540	1704740	Yo, yo, the man about to take the stage
1704740	1707260	is all of Milwaukee's rage.
1707260	1710820	He's a graduate of this academy.
1710820	1714220	He's going to start throwing at him, at him.
1714220	1716980	Okay, all right, look, look, I'm a little sober.
1716980	1719540	All right, whoa, yeah.
1719540	1720380	You gonna start again?
1720380	1721220	You can.
1721220	1722060	Yeah, yeah.
1722060	1722900	Okay, go.
1722900	1725020	Yo, the man about to take the stage
1725020	1727360	is all of Milwaukee's rage.
1727360	1730140	He went to Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
1730140	1733860	He ate your mama's pussy until she, okay, all right.
1735060	1735900	All right.
1735900	1737620	This is gonna be played at the alma mater.
1737620	1738820	Don't leave us hanging like that.
1738820	1739660	Okay, all right, all right.
1739660	1741540	I mean, I can just write it.
1741540	1742380	I can just write it.
1742380	1743220	Until what?
1743220	1746940	Yo, okay, yo, yo, which camera should I look into, Chris?
1747220	1748340	This one right here?
1748340	1749180	Okay, all right.
1749180	1750180	Let's get this right.
1750180	1752820	Yo, you're a camera three, you're a camera three.
1752820	1754540	The man about to take the stage.
1754540	1756660	Oh, wait, no, wait, how did I, that wasn't right.
1756660	1761420	Okay, yo, yo, yo, yo, what's up, Milwaukee?
1761420	1765260	Yo, yo, the man about to take the stage
1766460	1767820	is all of Milwaukee's rage.
1767820	1770500	He went to Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
1770500	1772980	He ate your mama's pussy with a squeeze of lime.
1772980	1777980	He, please welcome Rob Shroff.
1779860	1782860	Yo, fine arts graduate.
1782860	1785900	Yo, he paints murals on walls.
1787140	1787980	That's not all.
1787980	1791020	He also made skud, the disposable assassin.
1791020	1793260	And he started right here taking classes
1793260	1796900	in fine art and graphic design.
1796900	1801020	Ate your mama's pussy with lime, as I mentioned earlier.
1801060	1803620	He also knows how to play the werelet, sir.
1803620	1805060	No, he doesn't.
1805060	1806340	Forced that rhyme.
1806340	1809180	Also, he ate your mama's pussy with lime.
1809180	1813620	He went to Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
1813620	1816860	D to the E to the S-I-G-N.
1816860	1818340	He fucked your mama again.
1818340	1820780	Now he's coming out to speak to you
1820780	1822420	and I'm sure you've got questions.
1822420	1824020	I do too.
1824020	1828460	Dear Mr. Shroff, how did art affect your life day to day?
1828460	1833460	Well, I'm pretty sure that did good.
1834660	1837140	That's a little sneak preview.
1837140	1838500	And now here's what we're gonna do.
1838500	1840060	We're gonna dance break.
1842380	1843220	Oh yeah.
1853980	1856700	Rob Shroff is 57,000 years old.
1856700	1858740	So don't make your questions too bold.
1858740	1861260	He might get scared and might run away
1861260	1863940	and then eat some prune juice and curds and whey.
1863940	1865540	It's all he can digest at this point.
1865540	1867140	He's like a mummy.
1867140	1869340	Food that's too harsh is hard on his tummy.
1869340	1871540	He's 57 years old.
1874020	1879020	But he sold his comic book rights to Oliver Stone in 1996.
1880460	1882780	And that's why I'm standing here.
1882780	1884980	All right, let's take it from the top
1884980	1886300	in case it needs to be clean.
1886780	1890100	Okay, here's Rob Shroff in case he can use that one.
1890100	1892220	Ladies and gentlemen, Rob Shroff.
1892220	1893060	That's not usable.
1893060	1893900	Okay.
1893900	1894740	I'm gonna start the beat from the top
1894740	1896260	so you have some-
1896260	1898420	Okay, and maybe I should enter frame, right?
1903500	1906740	Yo, the man about to take the stage is world famous.
1906740	1908020	He's Milwaukee's rage.
1908020	1910860	His name is Rob Shroff and he gets the job done.
1910860	1913500	He went here in your school, son.
1913500	1915740	If you ask him for wisdom, you might get it.
1916700	1920700	Oh, fuck, I can't, I can't, I just, fuck.
1920700	1921540	All right, sorry.
1925020	1925860	Okay, wait.
1933820	1936300	Yo, MC Harmon's the name.
1936300	1938580	Hosting Harmontown is my podcast game,
1938580	1940680	but I'm not here to introduce myself.
1940680	1943380	I'm here to pull my best friend from Milwaukee off the shelf.
1943820	1944860	His name is Rob Shroff.
1944860	1946140	He went to your school.
1946140	1947900	He's gonna talk, so pay attention.
1947900	1948900	Don't be a fool.
1948900	1950780	Ask him questions about art and shit
1950780	1953380	and how he sucked your mama's tit.
1953380	1954420	Fuck, God damn it.
1957820	1959980	For those listening to how Dan keeps leaving the stage
1959980	1964060	and coming back into frame to get the extra showbiz.
1964060	1966220	MC Harmon is my name.
1966220	1969260	Coming from Milwaukee is my game.
1969260	1970100	So dumb.
1973900	1976500	Milwaukee is a town that makes people famous.
1984340	1986780	Brew City coming from the top.
1986780	1988900	I fucked your mama with the handle of a mop.
1988900	1989740	All right.
2000500	2003140	This show brought to you by the Weinstein Corporation.
2004260	2006700	Jerry State, Milwaukee's not the capital.
2008500	2009640	All right, sorry.
2009640	2010740	You can't rap at all.
2012220	2013580	All right, just rhyming.
2013580	2015100	I'm just rhyming, just rhyming.
2015940	2016780	Here we go.
2016780	2017860	I think this is the one.
2017860	2019660	I think this is the one, I can feel it.
2029540	2032220	My name is MC Dan.
2032220	2033220	I've got a rap.
2033220	2034420	This one has a plan.
2034420	2037060	I'm gonna introduce to you a very great man.
2037060	2040100	He went to your school with his butt in a can.
2040100	2041780	That's all he had for tuition back then,
2041780	2044500	but he worked real hard and he started to win.
2044500	2045500	He took fine arts.
2045500	2047500	He took graphic design.
2048020	2049980	He ate your mama's pussy with a squeeze of lime.
2049980	2052100	Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
2053100	2055580	The alumni time is here.
2055580	2057260	It's time to ask him questions.
2057260	2060940	It's time to make investions into your future
2060940	2062300	by gaining wisdom.
2064220	2069220	His cum is probably frothy.
2078300	2080780	Talk more about the alumnus' cum.
2085220	2087740	My name is Dan Harmon.
2087740	2089860	I'm pretty charming.
2089860	2092500	I don't need to introduce myself.
2092500	2095100	I'm gonna bring my best friend off the shelf.
2095100	2097860	He went to your school called MyAd.
2097860	2101260	He's not in the Chinese Triad, but if he was,
2101260	2102540	that would be fine.
2102540	2103900	His balls have fuzz.
2104900	2107820	So do mine, damn it, so do mine.
2107820	2109540	I know, but I gotta keep it clean, right?
2109540	2111140	Because his mom's gonna be there.
2111140	2113460	Too much shoe leather, it's hard.
2113460	2115620	I thought this was the rest of the podcast.
2115620	2116780	It could be, why not?
2121260	2122100	You want a different beat?
2122100	2122940	You like that one?
2125820	2126660	You wanna try something else?
2126660	2129340	It might open up the cans here a little bit.
2129340	2130180	Let's try this one.
2133900	2138900	Yo, about to come to the stage right now,
2144500	2149100	someone that made Milwaukee on the map-ber
2149100	2150300	than it was before.
2152420	2153660	I'm not gonna tell you his name
2153660	2156660	till the end of this freestyle rap
2159340	2161320	by me, Dan Harmon.
2162320	2167320	Yo, Milwaukee is a city, sittin' on the river.
2171800	2174720	It's kinda shitty, fuck, God damn it.
2174720	2176240	I can't, I can't, I can't.
2176240	2179600	Okay, just start it, use that same track.
2179600	2180440	From the beginning?
2180440	2181280	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2181280	2182120	Okay, here we go.
2182120	2182960	All right, this one's real.
2182960	2184080	This is like, you're sitting at MyAd
2184080	2185560	and then the screen comes up, okay.
2185560	2189000	Use Milwaukee's awesome city motto too
2189000	2189840	when you get a chance.
2189840	2190680	Okay.
2190700	2192880	Because I adore the Milwaukee city motto.
2192880	2193880	Right, okay.
2199560	2200400	Sup.
2202160	2206160	Milwaukee's generated very many
2206160	2208400	fine specimens of human being.
2211320	2215600	George Clooney, I assume, don't look it up.
2216840	2219840	Myself, M.C. Harmon, and the man
2219840	2222320	that's about to take the stage.
2222320	2226440	My name is Dan, D-A-N, and I'm about to bring
2226440	2228720	the master of Milwaukee in.
2228720	2233200	He is a great person from a great lake.
2233200	2236000	His credentials are not fake.
2236000	2239920	He went to MyAd, that's the Milwaukee Institute
2239920	2244220	of Art and Design, man, God damn it, fuck you.
2245520	2249600	His name is Rob Shrob, but don't applaud yet
2249600	2251440	because the job ain't done.
2251440	2255080	I'm gonna rap and then run and introduce him.
2255080	2258720	His dick is so big, it's got gluten in it.
2260520	2263960	He's fine arts, but, but, but, but, major,
2263960	2265820	but fine arts, no he didn't.
2265820	2267820	I think he majored in graphic design.
2270720	2272760	And then he created Skud.
2272760	2275000	All right, God damn it, I fucked up, I fucked up.
2275000	2275880	Can we do just one more?
2275880	2277280	I swear to God, one more.
2277280	2278120	All right.
2278120	2279960	Hey man, I'm having the time of my life.
2279960	2282040	I actually gotta be somewhere in 20 minutes, so.
2282040	2282880	For real?
2282880	2283720	No.
2283720	2286520	You gotta go back to get some sweet cupping going on?
2286520	2287480	Yeah, sweet cupping.
2287480	2288320	Sweet cupping.
2288320	2289360	Sweet cupping cakes.
2289360	2291520	I'm gonna cup the shit out of you later, Spencer.
2291520	2292520	All right, here we go, you ready, Dan?
2292520	2293360	Yeah.
2293360	2295000	Just, Dan, let it fly.
2295000	2296960	I know, but I can't be profane.
2296960	2300960	Yeah, don't be profane, just let it just go.
2300960	2301880	Be yourself.
2301880	2317160	Yo, I'm here to introduce the most important man that ever
2317160	2320160	came out of Milwaukee.
2320160	2322040	It's not me.
2322040	2325720	It's my best friend, Rob Schwab.
2325720	2328240	Yo, yo, yo, Schwab.
2328240	2335080	Yo, Schwab, yo, Schwab, Schwab, S-C-H-R-A-B.
2335080	2339360	Milwaukee is the place you want to be from.
2339360	2341160	Oh, fuck, this is the shittiest rap.
2341160	2342040	I can't do it.
2342040	2343560	You got it, you got it, you got it.
2343560	2345760	God damn it.
2345760	2348240	I can't fucking do it.
2348240	2349640	You want to try another beat?
2349640	2352200	Yeah, give me one more beat.
2352200	2354080	I'm sorry.
2354080	2355760	This is good.
2355760	2356720	OK.
2356720	2357640	This is the one.
2358640	2364760	Yo, yo, yo, yo, a great place via Great Lake.
2364760	2366520	Rob Schwab's coming to the stage.
2366520	2367240	He's not fake.
2367240	2370240	He's got his credentials from MIAD.
2370240	2374080	You go to C, he's the man to C. You're going to ask him some
2374080	2377920	Q's and A's, and he's going to soak up Milwaukee's rays, get
2377920	2381120	the vitamin D from the sun's always shining.
2381120	2385600	My, I'm a, fuck, graphic design, and I can't do it.
2386240	2388600	Fuck, graphic design, and I could have said, god damn it.
2388600	2389400	Oh, yeah.
2389400	2391320	All right, all right, all right.
2391320	2394200	Yo, ain't no joke.
2394200	2395320	He's going to come out.
2395320	2396600	Fuck, fuck.
2396600	2399880	One more, one more, one more, one more.
2399880	2402160	I'm going to do a good job, you know?
2402160	2405280	You had to sign in right there.
2405280	2406280	You ready?
2406280	2407600	OK, don't think, don't think.
2407600	2411160	Just like when you, yeah, yeah, clean entrance.
2411160	2413200	Make it clean, clear frame.
2413200	2414640	Here we go.
2414640	2416680	You know, for $5 a month, you can watch Dan in a clear
2416680	2420200	frame for our subscribers.
2420200	2421440	Here we go.
2423440	2428000	Yo, what's up, Brew City?
2428000	2431720	Yo, you ain't shitty to me.
2431720	2435120	A great place by a great lake, but now I'm bringing up the
2435120	2436400	man, for god's sake.
2436400	2439480	He's my best friend that went to your hometown with you.
2439480	2441400	He went to my ad, so what you going to do?
2441400	2445360	You going to ask him questions and learn some stuff?
2445360	2449040	I ate your mama's muff last night.
2449040	2450600	Sorry, fuck.
2450600	2453000	OK, no, here we go.
2453000	2458600	S-C-H-R-A-B. He is the man to see.
2458600	2460520	Get some wisdom from him.
2460520	2465040	He's about to start coming now, right up to the stage.
2465040	2468560	He's the man that gave my ad all its rage and all its
2468560	2470760	glory and all its passion.
2470840	2474880	Don't talk to me about crashing a party when yours should
2474880	2476120	be home drying.
2480520	2483160	Do your homework.
2483160	2485800	Rob Shrob, ladies and gentlemen.
2485800	2488320	Rob Shrob, here he comes.
2488320	2490880	Rob Shrob.
2490880	2492120	Here he is.
2498080	2500080	All right, let me do one.
2500080	2501720	So save that one.
2501720	2505440	And then, all right, well, I'll do one more, you're saying?
2505440	2506920	I thought the mama's muff was good.
2506920	2509640	All right, well, one more, but then I also have to do one
2509640	2512360	that's just like in case he can't use the rap at all.
2512360	2513800	I'll do one where I just say stuff.
2513800	2514920	OK, you want the beat?
2514920	2516040	Yeah.
2516040	2517280	OK.
2520040	2528640	Yo, oh, yo, oh, yo, oh, my name is Dan Harmon.
2528640	2531960	I come from Milwaukee, but I'm not there for tonight's
2531960	2533760	walkie-talkie today.
2533760	2536680	Fuck, what?
2536680	2538320	The horrible feeling you're going to say, bukkake.
2544320	2552400	Yo, yeah, yo, yeah, yo, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah.
2552400	2553680	My name is Dan Harmon.
2553680	2555440	I come from Milwaukee.
2555440	2558080	Rob Shrob's coming out like bukkake in a minute.
2559520	2563120	You fucking asshole.
2563120	2565840	Jeff Davis put that rhyme in my head, but now I'm
2565840	2567680	introducing Rob Shrob instead.
2567680	2570600	He's my best friend for about 30 years.
2570600	2571720	Is that how old we are?
2571720	2575040	But we started drinking beers where you are, right there in
2575040	2576240	your hometown.
2576240	2580040	But when Rob Shrob was home, he was down in the basement
2580040	2581520	drawing robots and shit.
2581520	2583240	And that's why he's here.
2583240	2584440	Get over it.
2584440	2587520	He's the super alumnus.
2587520	2589160	You're going to be glad you've come to this.
2589160	2592800	You're going to ask him questions and stuff, and I'm
2592800	2594040	not going to say muff.
2597040	2598960	Here he comes to the stage.
2598960	2601560	He's the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design's rage.
2601560	2604080	He's the most famous dude, the most powerful.
2604080	2606600	Not that those things matter, but here you go.
2606600	2609920	You're going to get a taste of what makes him great and ask
2609920	2611960	him really important questions for God's sake.
2611960	2613480	Don't just say, can I have a job?
2613480	2614840	Because you can't.
2614840	2618240	So here he comes with his special pants, Rob Shrob.
2625640	2626800	Yeah, we got that one.
2626800	2627760	That's the one.
2627760	2629960	So we'll give him that one.
2629960	2634080	I think the faculty and the parents, the 10 that are going
2634080	2637120	to be happy to know that the special guest is coming on
2637120	2639080	stage like Bukaki.
2639080	2640400	All right, so all right.
2640400	2642080	It means a lot.
2642080	2646960	All right, hello, Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
2646960	2647840	I'm Dan Harmon.
2647840	2649320	I'm also from Milwaukee.
2649320	2650880	I did not go to your school.
2650880	2652720	I went to Marquette for a little bit, and then I dropped
2652720	2657680	out, but Shrob, who I, oh shit, I should say his name.
2657680	2658600	I should save it for the end.
2658600	2659680	OK, take two.
2659680	2661440	All right, Mark it.
2661440	2668680	Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, S to the C to the H-R-A-B. Coming to
2668680	2670600	the stage is the man you want to be.
2670600	2673360	You stay in school and major in graphic design, the
2673360	2677360	Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
2677360	2680200	It's not cheating to rhyme design with design, if that's
2680200	2681480	the name of the school.
2681480	2685760	Rob Shrob is the man you need to ask questions of.
2685760	2687160	All right, all right, obviously, I'm not going to
2687160	2689240	just suddenly do a good rap.
2689240	2690840	We fought for a second, I would.
2690840	2692000	All right, here we go.
2692000	2693600	So here's the verbal one.
2693600	2696560	OK, I'm going to kill myself.
2696560	2697560	I'm going to walk off stage.
2697560	2700000	I'm just going to hear a gunshot and the birds are
2700000	2702480	going to start singing again.
2702480	2703720	All right.
2708320	2710120	Hello.
2710120	2712200	Are you an artist?
2712200	2714800	Or is your son or daughter one?
2714800	2719440	Or is your child a non-gender binary?
2719440	2721880	Starting over.
2721880	2726640	Stay on target, stay on target.
2726640	2727880	Hello, Milwaukee.
2727960	2729760	Thanks for voting for Trump, you fucks.
2733480	2735680	Yeah, I was going to come back and visit too, but I had
2735680	2738320	socks to sort, you fucks.
2738320	2741160	I know, Milwaukee probably didn't vote for him.
2741160	2744640	I'm sure it's a blue island in a big, dumb red state.
2744640	2746240	All right, here we go.
2746240	2747280	Butter emails.
2747280	2748960	All right.
2748960	2751640	Hello, Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design.
2751640	2755200	I did not go to you, but I did live in your city.
2755200	2760640	My name is Dan Harmon, and I have become famous.
2760640	2765000	But I'm about to introduce somebody even more important
2765000	2765920	than myself.
2765920	2771440	He's the reason why I went to Los Angeles on a U-Haul with
2771440	2775240	only my mattress and a pile of hustlers in a crate.
2775240	2780280	And now I'm so glad that I followed him and
2780280	2781240	listened to him.
2781240	2784640	He always had the best advice for me.
2784720	2789360	Every single time I ever asked him for any feedback on a
2789360	2792600	screenplay or how to solve a problem, his advice
2792600	2795560	throughout my entire life was always the exact right advice.
2795560	2798520	I only kept failing because I very often
2798520	2800800	forgot to follow it.
2800800	2805080	He's a really, really, really special, really smart guy.
2805080	2809400	And he went to your school, and he benefited from all it
2809400	2810080	has to offer.
2810080	2813600	So I think this is going to be a great evening for you.
2813600	2817080	Sorry, I can't make eye contact with you.
2817080	2823360	Please welcome back to your Institute of Art and Design,
2823360	2825800	Mr. Rob Shrob.
2835400	2836520	OK, all right.
2836520	2838400	Good enough, right?
2838400	2840080	Yeah, that was good.
2840080	2840680	All right.
2840680	2841680	I almost did this one.
2844600	2846680	Should we play D&D?
2846680	2847160	Yeah.
2847160	2848160	It's a bit early, right?
2848160	2849680	Well, I mean, I guess that doesn't matter.
2849680	2851400	No, Dan just rapped for 90 minutes.
2851400	2852400	I get that.
2852400	2853240	Don't get me wrong.
2853240	2855240	I'm not saying that the rapping segment was short.
2855240	2857240	I have little tears in my eyes right now, Dan.
2857240	2858080	That was exciting.
2858080	2861240	Well, can I do one rap now that doesn't have to be clean?
2861240	2863080	You can do all the raps you want.
2863080	2863920	I feel like.
2866560	2871800	Do you feel any difference rapping to the lack of audience?
2872640	2875320	Or is that not a factor?
2875320	2876480	I don't know.
2876480	2878320	I mean, have I ever been good?
2878320	2880680	You have your moments when you really lay it down.
2880680	2881280	Yeah.
2881280	2885320	Well, let's see if we can create some without the audience.
2885320	2886880	Zach, what's that beat you got?
2886880	2887600	Let's do something new.
2887600	2890800	You got a beat you can lay on us, or is that going to be hard?
2890800	2894280	Yeah, I like when you DJ, because you got the goods.
2894280	2897800	Zach McKeever, everybody, on audio.
2897800	2898280	All right.
2899280	2900280	Yo.
2900280	2901280	Yo.
2901280	2902280	Yo.
2902280	2903280	Yo.
2903280	2904280	Oh, no.
2904280	2905280	Oh, shit.
2905280	2906280	Here we go.
2906280	2907280	Yo.
2907280	2908280	About to spit fire.
2908280	2910280	Dropping science, taking me higher.
2910280	2912280	My rap is a function of biology.
2912280	2913280	I fucked your mama so hard.
2913280	2914280	It was Scientology.
2914280	2916280	I cleared his heatings off her neck.
2916280	2917280	I fucked her.
2917280	2918280	Ruled her over.
2918280	2920280	Heck, I said to your mama, go back to church.
2920280	2923280	I fucked your mama like her name was Lurch from the Addams Family League.
2923280	2927280	Got a hand in a box going up into your mama's socks, putting them inside out.
2927280	2929280	Putting them inside out like the pantyhose.
2929280	2931280	I fucked your mama, because that's the way it goes.
2931280	2933280	I fucked your mama, because that's the way it goes.
2933280	2935280	I fucked your mama, because that's the way it goes.
2935280	2937280	Turned your socks inside out like pantyhose.
2937280	2939280	I fucked your mama, because that's the way it goes.
2939280	2943280	Went to the garage and built a canoe, because I had nothing else to do.
2943280	2945280	It's the new hobby that I'm pursuing.
2945280	2949280	I fucked your mama and started chewing on her labia, but not hard.
2949280	2952280	Just a nibble, just a tiny love nibble.
2952280	2953280	She asked for it.
2953280	2954280	She likes it.
2955280	2957280	Went up to the attic.
2957280	2959280	Fucked your mama, she was ecstatic.
2959280	2961280	Said, go get the handcuffs.
2961280	2963280	Fucked her so hard, she had dandruff.
2965280	2967280	Fucked her with her follicles with my dick.
2967280	2971280	Made her hair retain more grease, because of my dick.
2971280	2973280	Fucked your mama seven ways.
2973280	2975280	Fucked your mama for 19 days.
2975280	2977280	Fucked your mama, didn't drink any water.
2977280	2979280	Fucked your mama, made two sons and a daughter.
2979280	2981280	Sent them to school, paid for their education.
2981280	2983280	Fucked your mama all across the nation.
2983280	2984280	Fucked her in Canada.
2984280	2985280	Fucked her in Mexico too.
2985280	2987280	Fucked her in North America.
2988280	2989280	Okay?
2990280	2991280	Fucked her everywhere.
2992280	2993280	Fucked your mama.
2994280	2995280	Fucked your mama.
2996280	2997280	Fucked your mama.
2998280	2999280	Here we go.
3000280	3001280	Fucked your mama.
3002280	3003280	Race!
3003280	3015280	The Olympics give medals for shit, but I never depended on it.
3015280	3017280	Just fucked your mama so good, they gave me one.
3017280	3019280	I just did that for fun.
3019280	3020280	They said, here's your gold medal.
3020280	3021280	Fucked your mama so good.
3021280	3023280	I said, look, I just got special wood.
3023280	3025280	It's all I do.
3025280	3026280	Just fuck mamas.
3026280	3027280	Now along comes you.
3027280	3029280	You're telling me that you got a metric and a reward system.
3029280	3030280	I don't know.
3030280	3031280	I'm not even listening.
3031280	3033280	I only fuck mamas for fun.
3033280	3035280	I only fuck mamas until they say I'm done.
3035280	3038280	I follow their guidance and their permission.
3038280	3039280	Fright emission.
3040280	3041280	Nocturnal or daylight.
3041280	3044280	Fucked your mama so hard, she says, I stay right.
3044280	3045280	Fuck.
3045280	3046280	God damn it.
3046280	3047280	Don't lose your flow.
3047280	3048280	Oh, you're doing so good, Harmon.
3048280	3049280	Keep going.
3049280	3050280	Oh, yeah.
3050280	3051280	Okay.
3051280	3052280	Oh, yeah.
3052280	3053280	An aircraft carrier made out of pussies.
3054280	3055280	All right.
3055280	3056280	All right.
3056280	3057280	I wasn't going anywhere.
3057280	3058280	Please continue that forever.
3058280	3059280	All right.
3059280	3061280	An aircraft carrier made out of pussies.
3061280	3064280	I mean, what are you going to get, Gary Busey's?
3064280	3065280	What are you going to write?
3065280	3066280	Okay.
3066280	3067280	All right.
3067280	3068280	Yes, exactly.
3068280	3069280	A big ship made out of vaginas.
3069280	3071280	I landed on it, the USS in North Carolina.
3071280	3073280	I got out, submission accomplished.
3073280	3077280	I fucked your mama so hard, she made my dick a dish of filet mignon.
3077280	3080280	And I served it until I was...
3080280	3081280	Okay.
3081280	3082280	All right.
3082280	3083280	Just backing up.
3083280	3084280	Backing up.
3084280	3085280	Okay.
3085280	3086280	Okay.
3086280	3087280	Okay.
3087280	3088280	Just take it easy.
3088280	3089280	Everybody take it easy.
3089280	3090280	Everybody take it easy.
3090280	3091280	Yo.
3091280	3092280	Yo.
3092280	3093280	Yo.
3093280	3094280	Rapping.
3094280	3095280	Rapping like this.
3095280	3096280	Rapping.
3096280	3097280	Rapping like that.
3097280	3098280	Kicking.
3098280	3099280	Kicking in the air.
3099280	3100280	Fuck your mama.
3100280	3101280	Don't even care.
3101280	3102280	Raise my hands.
3102280	3103280	Lower them down.
3103280	3104280	Fuck your mama like a birthday princess or a clown.
3104280	3105280	Put out some balloons.
3105280	3106280	Made them into animals.
3106280	3107280	Fuck your mama so hard.
3107280	3108280	That's the way it always goes.
3108280	3109280	Oh.
3109280	3110280	I went into the pool.
3110280	3111280	I took a pee and grabbed a bar stool.
3111280	3112280	Put it in my butt.
3112280	3113280	Got three friends.
3113280	3115280	And that's where that story ends.
3115280	3116280	Crossed the threshold.
3116280	3117280	Met with a goddess.
3117280	3119280	Fuck your mama so hard to stitch through a bodice.
3119280	3120280	All right.
3120280	3121280	Damn.
3121280	3122280	You rammed goddess with bodice.
3122280	3132280	You fucked up mama so hard that she ended up having dandruff.
3132280	3133280	Yeah.
3133280	3135840	You fucked all the moisture out of her scalp.
3135840	3136840	You made a canoe.
3136840	3141480	You made a canoe.
3141480	3142480	You said the main...
3142480	3143480	I mean, I don't want to nitpick.
3143480	3146720	You said, like, make a canoe and then you, like, did a rhyme about chewing, but you could
3146720	3147720	have said, like, what a canoeing.
3147720	3148720	Yeah.
3148720	3149720	It would have been fun.
3149720	3152720	You said, I made a canoe because that's what I was doing and then I took the canoe and
3152720	3153720	started chewing.
3153720	3154720	You could have started canoeing.
3154720	3155720	But no.
3155720	3157720	We had a lot of fun.
3157720	3159720	We're armchair rappers.
3159720	3160720	Right.
3160720	3161720	It's easy.
3161720	3162720	We're Monday morning rappers.
3162720	3164280	It's easy from over here.
3164280	3172360	It's easy to be a Monday morning rapper, which is certainly the time of this episode.
3172360	3175360	Let's bring Steve Levy to the stage.
3175360	3182360	What's going down, baby?
3182360	3196600	How easy is it to show people my new favorite game?
3196600	3198840	Um, Chris, can we...
3198840	3200520	If I haven't plugged in here, can it...
3200520	3202920	So, Stevie, how's your love life?
3202920	3203920	Oh, come on.
3203920	3206440	Did you just call me Stevie?
3206440	3207440	Yep.
3207440	3208440	It's Portmanteau.
3208440	3209440	I love it.
3209440	3210840	Can I do it on purpose?
3210840	3214000	My family, they used to call me Stevie Levy.
3214000	3215000	Right.
3215000	3216000	I can imagine.
3216000	3217000	I got it up on my screen.
3217000	3218520	Yeah, but that's their fault.
3218520	3221480	That's kind of a, that's kind of a Monopoly guy.
3221480	3225840	So if you name your kid a name that's going to rhyme with the last name, that's not being
3225840	3226960	clever.
3226960	3228440	Three old people on a screen.
3228440	3229440	Steven, I don't know.
3229440	3230440	Two of these dudes are...
3230440	3232240	It's like naming your kid Robbie or Schwab.
3232240	3233240	Come on.
3233240	3234240	Don't make me feel that old.
3234240	3235240	I mean, old interior.
3235240	3236240	Oh, here we go.
3236240	3237240	Historical.
3237240	3238240	Look at this game.
3238240	3239240	It's a crafting game.
3239240	3240240	What's it called?
3240240	3241240	I gotta, I gotta figure out the name.
3241240	3242240	What's this one called?
3242240	3243240	Dawn of Crafting.
3243240	3244240	Dawn of Crafting.
3244240	3245360	So what's the, what's the, what's the purpose here?
3245360	3246360	We got three guys.
3246360	3247920	We got like an inventory sheet.
3247920	3251800	So you're a caveman and you take these things and then you can craft, right?
3251800	3254360	So I got a rock and then another rock and then you can craft.
3254360	3255360	Oh, okay.
3255360	3256360	Ooh.
3256360	3257360	What'd you make?
3257360	3258360	Well, okay.
3258360	3261160	And then you can make that knife and then you can take the, you can take the, uh, you
3261160	3265520	can take the, um, knife and you could probably...
3265520	3266520	Slice some vegetables.
3266520	3269880	See, and then you, oh, see, that's a new thing I learned.
3269880	3270880	Sliced eggplant.
3270880	3272600	Oh, so, so you learn new recipes.
3272600	3274840	Why are those leaves flying by at the background?
3274840	3275840	Is that just for fun?
3275840	3276840	That's ambience.
3276840	3278880	Well, maybe that's showing the wind direction.
3278880	3280880	Are you in a straw hut?
3280880	3281880	Yeah.
3281880	3282880	Oh, shit.
3282880	3283880	It'll see.
3283880	3284880	I don't know.
3284880	3285880	Are you all three of those guys?
3285880	3286880	Or are your plate, you're playing the speed?
3286880	3287880	The, the, the...
3287880	3288880	Yeah.
3288880	3289880	I mean, I am all three of them.
3289920	3293480	Look, I'm not, I'm not giving it a good, uh, people, people are going to think it's a dumb
3293480	3294480	game, but it's not.
3294480	3295480	It's cool.
3295480	3296480	All right.
3296480	3297480	No, people are digging it.
3297480	3298480	All right.
3298480	3299480	That's enough.
3299480	3302760	Spencer, do you, do you remember that game on like MS-DOS where you're, you play as cavemen
3302760	3304960	and you try to, there was like a wheel?
3304960	3305960	No.
3305960	3307000	It's called Dawn of Crafting.
3307000	3314560	If you are even remotely, uh, a fan of crafting...
3314560	3319280	Dan, is there any danger of dinosaurs coming and attacking this crafting situation?
3319280	3322000	No, it's not written by a Christian.
3322000	3323000	Oh.
3323000	3324000	Yeah.
3324000	3325000	Right.
3325000	3327000	That's so confusing.
3327000	3328000	Yeah.
3328000	3332560	Look, I just downloaded this sound effects app three minutes before show time.
3332560	3334800	I didn't really have time to, to vet these sounds.
3334800	3336360	You're doing everything right.
3336360	3337360	All right.
3337360	3340040	Levi, we got to talk about love life.
3340040	3341040	No.
3341040	3344800	Levi, what's, what's going on in Levi's romantic situation?
3344800	3347200	There's not much.
3347200	3348920	Three times Steve comes up.
3348920	3350480	There's not much happening.
3350480	3351720	I told you, give me time.
3351720	3353760	Then maybe I'll have something to report.
3353760	3354760	All right.
3354760	3355760	Well, I mean, I, yeah.
3355760	3361600	Do you, do you guys see, speaking of, speaking of our sexy friends, like Steve Levi, did
3361600	3365640	you know that Kumail Nanjiani is today's People Magazine hot guy of the day?
3365640	3366640	Oh yeah.
3366640	3367640	Of the day?
3367640	3369800	I think puts him in the running for the hottest man of the year.
3369800	3372240	Oh, are they picking 365 people?
3372240	3373240	I don't know.
3373240	3376080	I don't know how the whole thing works, but there's a picture of him having breakfast
3376080	3379480	in bed with leather, leather pillows.
3379480	3383840	And he's got like grapes and three cocktails and he's looking good.
3383840	3386640	Well, he'll probably handle that well.
3386640	3389600	What do you mean?
3389600	3394520	Oh, you know, he last time he was on the show, he came out with a crown on his head and he
3394520	3396280	didn't, his movie wasn't even out yet.
3396280	3398200	That was just Silicon Valley.
3398200	3401800	He's a guy's he's, you know, we're all going to be working for him.
3401800	3402800	Yeah.
3402800	3405280	What's it like to be less famous than one of your friends?
3405280	3414760	It's not, it's, it's, I'm not jealous, I, uh, it just hurts to see other people succeed.
3414760	3418960	That's what can you delineate the difference between jealousy and I don't know.
3418960	3420360	I think it's some kind of condition I have.
3420360	3423280	I just experienced physical pain when other people succeed.
3423280	3428760	So it's not jealousy, jealousy is a bad quality.
3428760	3431360	You just can't enjoy your friends doing well.
3431360	3434680	I do enjoy it, but it hurts, God, it hurts.
3434880	3436000	It physically hurts me.
3436000	3437440	You need some, uh, some copping.
3437440	3438440	Yeah.
3438440	3439440	Oh yeah.
3439440	3440440	Uh, all right.
3440440	3448120	That, that, that effect implies that I was going to cut you with my dick.
3448120	3452520	So leave, he's not, leave, he's not talking, uh, what do you want to talk about?
3452520	3455400	He's just, he's just being, he's just being, uh, he's being bashful.
3455400	3460240	Like, you know, he's, let's give Steve 60 seconds to talk about whatever subject or subjects
3460240	3462240	he would like.
3462240	3463240	Go.
3463240	3469400	Uh, no one else talk.
3469400	3473160	So the, the, the Miami hurricanes won yesterday.
3473160	3474160	Oh, awesome.
3474160	3475160	Yeah.
3475160	3476160	There you go.
3476160	3481520	It was a, it was a big rivalry, Catholics versus convicts.
3481520	3484120	You guys know about that?
3484120	3485120	Oh yeah.
3485120	3487720	I saw that documentary that, that 30 for 30.
3487720	3488720	Yeah.
3488720	3489720	Yeah.
3489720	3490720	Yeah.
3490720	3491720	Yeah.
3491720	3494000	And then we stomped out Notre Dame.
3494000	3495160	So you're a convict.
3495160	3496160	I'm a convict.
3496160	3497160	Yeah.
3497160	3498760	Do they, do they own that or is that totally bullshit?
3498760	3501760	Like they did, like, do they kind of embrace that as they embrace it?
3501760	3506040	Like even the, even the announcers during the game are like, that's great.
3506040	3507040	Mentioning it.
3507040	3508040	Yeah.
3508040	3509040	Is it Notre Dame you said?
3509040	3510040	Yeah.
3510040	3511040	Yeah.
3511040	3513880	And every, so they invented this thing this year or every turnover, which is like where
3513880	3516040	they forced change of possession.
3516040	3517040	Yeah.
3517040	3518040	The change of possession.
3518040	3523920	You know, as the ball and they intercepted or recover a fumble, whatever player forces
3523920	3533800	the turnover, the turnover, they get this giant golden chain with the U on it, the turnover
3533800	3534800	chain.
3534800	3535800	And then they wear it.
3535800	3538200	It's like eight pounds or something during the game.
3538200	3539200	During the game.
3539200	3542320	No, no, they don't wear it on the field, but they wear it on the sideline and they're like,
3542320	3543720	they get their moment.
3543720	3544720	That's awesome.
3544720	3545720	Yeah.
3545720	3547080	Can you ever check out a 30 for 30?
3547440	3549440	A 30 for 30 now.
3549440	3551120	You might like it.
3551120	3553960	It's the narrative part of sports, not the sports part.
3553960	3554960	Yeah.
3554960	3555960	That's true.
3555960	3556960	Yeah.
3556960	3557960	I'm watching the one I'm halfway through the one about Ric Flair.
3557960	3558960	Have you watched that one?
3558960	3559960	No, no.
3559960	3560960	It sounds really interesting.
3560960	3561960	Yeah.
3561960	3562960	It's called nature boy.
3562960	3565840	And it's really good because I didn't know that much about Ric Flair and what his life
3565840	3566840	was like.
3566840	3567840	But like, I don't know.
3567840	3571680	I mean, he's still with us and he's still, he still looks like Ric Flair, but like, uh,
3571680	3578880	he like, there's, there's still teams that in their, in their locker room, warmup chant
3578880	3581720	like his like ring banter.
3581720	3585840	Like when he would come into the ring and grab the microphone, they quote Ric Flair.
3585840	3590280	That's how much of an impact he had on like sports as celebrity.
3590280	3591280	Right.
3591280	3593680	And now he's like a yoga guy, right?
3593680	3594680	Don't spoil it for me.
3594680	3595680	Spencer.
3595680	3600080	Ric Flair was the guy who, whose catchphrase was woo, woo.
3600080	3601080	That's the chance.
3601280	3604680	I'm the wheeling dealing, kiss stealing, you know, like glockenspielen.
3604680	3609880	He didn't say that when I made that up, but that'd be amazing if he was glockenspielen.
3609880	3616160	Cause catchphrases hadn't been, you know, that industry wasn't in full swing yet.
3616160	3618280	So your catchphrase could just be woo.
3618280	3621480	You already had Muhammad Ali, but he was certainly standing on Muhammad Ali shoulders and he
3621480	3628160	kind of, I think not ripped him off, but certainly was doing his silver haired riff on that.
3628160	3632920	But yeah, he was, you know, just like cheating on his wife all the time and doing, you know,
3632920	3637920	like, like drinking a lot and wrestling a lot and saying woo a lot, but it's a good
3637920	3638920	documentary.
3638920	3643160	What do you guys do when you go home at night?
3643160	3651640	Like video games and sleep or emails or something like that church and I'll get in the couch
3651640	3654280	and we'll watch like chop jr and fucking yell with the TV.
3654280	3655280	Oh yeah.
3655280	3656880	Chop jr is so much better than chop.
3656880	3658080	It's not even funny.
3658080	3659240	Is that the one with the kids?
3659240	3660240	Yeah.
3660240	3663880	So my brother, you know, they do fantasy sports like fantasy football and stuff.
3663880	3664880	They do.
3664880	3671000	They draft in the beginning of the season, all his friends go in and they get, I think
3671000	3677160	five kids and they all put money in and then it's whoever's kid ends up winning gets the
3677160	3678160	pot.
3678160	3679720	I am not a fantasy sports fan.
3679720	3682400	I don't do that, but I could get down on that.
3682400	3683400	Yeah.
3683400	3684400	That sounds great.
3684400	3685400	They have a blast.
3685400	3687920	They all get around, they watch the episodes together or yelling at each other when the
3687920	3690680	kids are like screwing up cooking and stuff.
3690680	3694440	I feel like you guys are having more fun living than me.
3694440	3695440	Like you're...
3695440	3696440	Okay, Dan.
3696440	3697440	I agree.
3697440	3698440	What do you do when you go home?
3698440	3699440	I don't have fun either.
3699440	3701200	Well, I just, Cody and I, we like, we just like being together.
3701200	3706440	We watch, if we watch something, we'll watch like a true crime thing, but we'll just listen
3706440	3709240	to one of a list of podcasts and things, but...
3709240	3712200	Yeah, that sounds really boring spending time with loved ones.
3712200	3715960	I'm just saying, I'm not talking about you guys are having more fun.
3715960	3719000	I guess, I mean, you guys seem like you're in a better mood than me.
3719000	3720000	That's what I meant.
3720000	3721000	Tonight?
3721000	3728160	Like lately, you know, like I've been feeling like with very little variation, like I've
3728160	3735600	been like getting closer and closer to just like, just about the world.
3735600	3738440	I'm just so deeply cynical, like I just hate people so much.
3738440	3745840	Yeah, but I feel like you've been pretty good, I feel like you've been in a good place
3746840	3747840	outside of that.
3747840	3750560	Well, I think, well, there's an irony there though, that's like kind of deceptive because
3750560	3753840	I think I truly like, I've kind of given up on humanity.
3753840	3759040	So once you've done that, you get in bad moods less because you're like, oh, you're not,
3759040	3760840	they're not letting you down anymore.
3760840	3762640	You're not like striving to accomplish anything.
3762640	3766840	I'm just like, oh, I live on a planet of fucking drooling, babbling animals.
3766840	3771720	I know that I'm in a worse mood generally lately than I have been probably ever.
3771720	3777440	And I don't know if that's just the ravages of time or the fact that we have a moron,
3777440	3782400	a literate douchebag president who constantly every day makes us embarrassed to be alive.
3782400	3787600	I have a theory slash rant about like, I don't know, you know, we've learned so much about
3787600	3793080	psychology recently, you know, for the longest time we haven't understood psychology and
3793080	3798600	sociology on the level we have and like trauma and how that impacts the brain and stuff.
3798600	3802680	But you know, there's obviously been human atrocities and terrible tragedies and trying
3802680	3806600	times through all of human history and stuff, but I don't know how often we've been able
3806600	3808720	to really think about it on that level.
3808720	3814160	I wonder if, you know, this sort of stuff has an effect on people historically.
3814160	3818440	Like if you went back to, I don't know, like the great leap forward or something or Holocaust
3818440	3823960	times, if people weren't also feeling like that, you know, just generally more agitated,
3823960	3825400	more at odds with people.
3825400	3827640	I wonder if that's something that's happening.
3827640	3830800	I would say it probably certainly does, like it's like a low grade.
3830800	3836600	If you look like these giant protests and there's all those Nazis and 60,000 fucking
3836600	3837600	yeah.
3837600	3838600	That's so crazy.
3838600	3843520	Like that's that that's an unhappy world saying, fix it, fix it, fix it.
3843520	3844520	Like, wait, where was that?
3844520	3845520	What are you talking about?
3845520	3846520	Warsaw.
3846520	3849080	Yeah, that's what I really checked out, man.
3849080	3851200	I saw it was like, it was like, are you fucking kidding me?
3851200	3852200	I'm Polish.
3852200	3859120	I like, I like, I race in Poland, Polish, Polish people are where the original Nazi
3859120	3860120	victims.
3860120	3865080	I mean, we're like, like we were getting picked on like, like my ancestors fled that shit.
3865080	3869240	Like it, it's like it's fuck.
3869240	3870240	It's fucking insane.
3870240	3875680	The entire city of Warsaw was bombed into oblivion that there's probably not more than
3875680	3881240	a couple of buildings that are still standing pre 1944.
3881240	3883680	The whole place just got annihilated.
3883680	3887360	It just makes me check out, you know, like, I don't, I don't, there's nothing.
3887360	3891480	It's just so much bigger than all of us, you know, it's so, it's so inexorable.
3891480	3896120	And so you just want to go, well, shit, I should have, I should have spent the last
3896120	3902100	year, you know, sticking to my elliptical and actually like building a doomsday shelter
3902100	3907000	and all this stuff, because it's not going to take, it's not, it didn't happen overnight.
3907000	3909600	So I kept snapping back out of it and going things will be okay.
3909600	3915920	But like, it's just like, the truth is, or at least feels like that it's like, okay,
3915920	3922560	we're on like a five year slide into hell on earth in one form or another, whether it's
3922560	3935000	nuclear annihilation or just like fucking like total, like global fascist
3935000	3940520	who's resulting in like a crazy, like, I can't tell which is going to be worse, like
3940520	3944800	the war version of it or the peace version of it where, but like, in any case, like just
3944800	3951640	like the definition of inhumanity, like getting so much harder to meet.
3951640	3957160	In other words, like atrocity becoming more and more tolerable and people pulling back
3957160	3958880	more and more.
3958880	3964560	Like I just like, I saw that those that photo of Poland, like, it's just like, it looks
3964560	3965560	like Mordor.
3965560	3966560	Just out.
3966560	3967560	Yeah.
3967560	3968560	I can't.
3968560	3969560	What am I supposed to do?
3969560	3970560	Throw a tin can at it?
3970560	3971560	Like what?
3971560	3973160	How am I supposed to brush my teeth?
3973160	3974160	Why?
3974160	3975160	How can I give a fuck?
3975160	3981760	Like the people have spoken, like they don't, they want to die.
3981760	3982760	All right.
3982760	3983760	So Steve, what are you seeing right now?
3983760	3984760	Anybody?
3984760	3987120	You gotta, you gotta squeeze on the side.
3987120	3989680	I don't have anything currently.
3989680	3992880	I sat next to a 73 year old lesbian woman.
3992880	3993880	I saw this.
3994880	3996880	This is good.
3996880	4001400	At the bar where our flight was delayed and she was a heavy, she, she, she, she was just,
4001400	4005800	she started chatting me up because we were both kettle one drinkers and, and also the
4005800	4006920	no lime thing.
4006920	4011840	She heard me on the plane, like making a big deal out of it and, but the guy in the plane,
4011840	4012840	did you hear the guy?
4012840	4014560	I go, I go, I go, no lime.
4014560	4015560	And the guy's like, uh-huh.
4015560	4016560	Yeah.
4016560	4017560	And I go, no lime.
4017560	4018560	And he goes like, yeah.
4018560	4021120	And I go like, I can't stress this enough.
4021120	4022120	No lime.
4022120	4023400	And he's like, all right.
4023400	4026280	And then when he brought, brought me the drink, he heard your raps about how many pusses
4026280	4027280	you ate with a little bit.
4027280	4031960	He brought me the drink back and he goes like, did someone on this flight give you a lime?
4031960	4036840	Like he, like, like given me two, it was like motherfucker, like no, no, not this flight.
4036840	4037840	What do you got?
4037840	4038840	What do you got?
4038840	4039840	Flight patriotism.
4039840	4044560	Someone in your fucking airline every goddamn time, the, the, the, the flight out there like
4044560	4050840	this is what happens every, no, no, no lime, uh, uh, uh, yeah.
4050840	4051840	And then come back.
4051840	4058840	I got a shish kebab of limes, like steep, like swished around and I said, I said, I
4058840	4062040	said, I go, I go, I go, I said, you got it.
4062040	4063040	I said no lime.
4063040	4065120	And she goes, Oh, all I heard was lime.
4065120	4066120	I, okay.
4066120	4067120	All right.
4067120	4068760	Look, language doesn't work that way.
4068760	4070360	All I heard was lime.
4070360	4076960	If, if, if all I heard was, uh, uh, now boarding and I just decided to get on the plane, you'd
4076960	4078560	fucking beat my ass.
4078560	4081320	Like you did that one guy when you wanted to make money.
4081320	4087440	Like, like, like you, you expect me to hear more than the words that I feel like hearing.
4087440	4088880	Fuck you, United Airlines.
4088880	4089880	Fuck you.
4089880	4092320	You fucking fuck all airlines, fucking cartel.
4092320	4093320	Especially there.
4093320	4096240	I got, I got, I got found someone to be angry about, but the guy's like, he was just like,
4096240	4098760	did someone, is that like the, the, the offense?
4098760	4099800	Like why are you offended?
4099800	4101320	I'm the fucking victim here, man.
4101320	4104760	I'm the one that's getting limes, putting all my shit all the time.
4104760	4107720	I'm the fucking lime, lime guy.
4107720	4111480	You're not, you're just a dude that's like wondering why I really need you to know no
4111480	4112480	lime in it.
4112480	4113480	You fuck.
4113480	4116920	Whenever I get soda, like I always ask for just the can and not the glass.
4116920	4120440	Cause if you ask for the glass, they'll just put like four ounces of soda and then keep
4120440	4121440	the can.
4121440	4122440	And then they never do that.
4122440	4125000	And it's like, you're, you're not even going somewhere else.
4125000	4127960	You're just reaching in to grab a can and I don't know.
4127960	4133880	I hate restaurants that, uh, like you, when you order delivery and they have Diet Coke
4133880	4138120	on their menu and then they, you, you order a Diet Coke, you're like, that sounds great.
4138120	4144720	Uh, and they, they, they bring you a taped up ass fucking plastic thing filled with ice.
4144720	4150840	It's like probably represents like two ounces of, of actual Diet Coke from a soda fountain
4150840	4151840	instead of a can.
4151840	4152840	Give me a can of Diet Coke.
4152840	4153840	All right.
4153840	4154840	It's taped up.
4154840	4157800	Well, yeah, they tape it up because you know, so it doesn't spill because they have to put
4157800	4162640	all this effort into saving money and just give me a can of Coke.
4163400	4164400	Yeah.
4164400	4168560	Church points out, uh, like there's, there are things to be, uh, happy about what you
4168560	4172280	were, were you heartened at all by the fact that we like on these last election was people
4172280	4178640	seek, uh, trans people, lesbians, black lives matter people, 73 year old lesbian.
4178640	4181680	And I did talk about where I like, but I, I, I, I, I, I have to be perfectly honest
4181680	4182680	with you.
4182680	4186120	I, I, I, I, I, the timing of this is like, I was, I was checked out.
4186120	4189480	Like I wasn't, I wasn't there for that victory mentally.
4189480	4194720	I heard about it third hand, you know, like, like after the fact because I wasn't following
4194720	4195720	it.
4195720	4196720	I wasn't rooting for anything.
4196720	4197960	I wasn't, I wasn't invested.
4197960	4200320	I was like numb, but that is great to hear.
4200320	4201320	It is.
4201320	4203920	And it's great to hear that that guy molested a 14 year old.
4203920	4204920	That's it.
4204920	4205920	It is great.
4205920	4211360	Did you see, did you see the guy, the guy with the, I retweeted that guy with the hammer.
4211360	4212360	Yeah.
4212360	4216640	I mean, I feel like I stole your, your thing because I like, I just go through any jokes.
4216640	4218320	I just, I'm just so angry.
4218320	4220840	I got so many retailing at people all the time.
4220840	4222920	This is about the guy taking a Keurig.
4222920	4223920	Uh, yeah.
4223920	4227800	The thing that he bought, Keurig has his money.
4227800	4228800	Here's my question.
4228800	4232600	He took a hammer out, which is the least, which I believe I want to know, I'm trying
4232600	4233600	to piece together the narrative.
4233600	4237360	Like I want to take out index cards and with each fact that we know, because one of them
4237360	4239000	is that he owns that machine.
4239000	4244600	One of them is that he, I won't say what wants to, you know, loves fucking children.
4244600	4247920	Like he, he, he, he, we won't go that far.
4247920	4252200	But, but we know he, he supports Hannity like they, so that's one index card.
4252200	4257000	And then he said, so I was thinking like, is this, is, did it become his favorite show
4257000	4262200	because of the, the child fucking support or, or was it already his favorite show?
4262200	4266040	And then, and then, and then he saw, and then Hannity came on the episode and was like,
4266040	4269320	I think that it's okay that this guy fucked a kid or tried to fuck a kid, tried to fuck
4269320	4270320	four kids.
4270320	4272160	Um, uh, it's fine.
4272160	4273440	It was 40 years ago.
4273440	4274840	And Hey, look, kids are kids.
4274840	4277760	They like, they know what they're doing and they know what they signed up for.
4277840	4281760	When they turned 14 and, and, and the guy was like watching it and he was like, fuck
4281760	4284080	it ain't finally like a show that's talking my language.
4284080	4286760	And then the commercials came out and the coffee maker commercial came out and said,
4286760	4289600	like, wouldn't you like a delicious cup of kurken coffee?
4289600	4293240	Uh, cougar, cougar, cougar, cougar, cougar ran coffee.
4293360	4298240	And he was like, fuck, I, I like, I do, I love coffee or he hates coffee, but he went
4298240	4300440	out and was like, I want to support the sponsor.
4300560	4301040	Yeah.
4301200	4303620	And then, and then he brings it home and he's like sipping it.
4303620	4306240	He's like, I'm not even a coffee fan, but I, I got it.
4306240	4307680	I just love fucking kids.
4307680	4311200	And then, and then, and then the, and then he saw the news and he's like, God damn it.
4312280	4316760	Some guy, I, I made a joke, like a tweet about like, you know, I, I, I've always
4316760	4321680	refused to make coffee out of any machine that by a company that isn't 100% into
4321680	4328520	pedophilia and then, uh, some guy responded and, and logically whoever it is, I did
4328520	4331400	block them because I read some of his other stuff and I didn't dig it.
4331840	4336200	Uh, but, but what he said was fine to start a conversation, but
4336200	4338360	I just know where the conversation is going to lead.
4338760	4342480	And it was, uh, oh, so if I accused you of mousing me when I was 14, you
4342480	4344680	wouldn't want your friends and family to presume you innocent and protect
4344680	4345680	you until, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4346080	4347000	Uh, nice to know.
4348260	4350600	If you didn't say the nice to know thing, I might've, I might've replied
4350600	4352800	and like not instantly blocked him.
4353360	4355760	But the thing is like your presumption of innocence thing.
4355800	4356560	Yes, of course.
4356560	4357640	Everyone's presumed innocent.
4357720	4360920	I mean, it's, it's innocent, uh, it's presumed innocent until proven guilty,
4361280	4362920	but not Obama.
4362920	4366040	He admitted it, he admitted it, he admitted it.
4366240	4369680	They're like, here's these kids that come forward to saying he touched me.
4369760	4371080	He goes on television.
4371240	4375520	I never dated any daughters under age without their mother's permission.
4375560	4377280	That's admitting he admitted it.
4377400	4378760	Like it's not even alleged.
4378760	4379680	He fucking did it.
4379680	4381800	And he didn't say, I didn't buy anybody any beers.
4381920	4384080	Yeah, no, but that's saying I did it.
4384680	4388040	But like people are saying, Oh, he admitted it.
4388080	4391560	Like we, Bill Cosby hasn't been proven guilty.
4391600	4394040	Um, 9,000 women said he raped him.
4394120	4395720	Bill Cosby hasn't admitted it.
4395760	4396840	Yeah, you go.
4396840	4397040	Yeah.
4397080	4402400	But exactly to his credit, he's a fighter.
4404840	4408680	If you take one lesson away from tonight's show, keep him out.
4409000	4409640	Um, okay.
4409640	4412280	But does, does Keurig make money off the K cups?
4412280	4416320	I thought any company can make K cups and they make the machine, right?
4416320	4420920	So, so they're not continuing to make dollars after the purchase because you
4420920	4422560	get your K cups from, you know, anywhere.
4422600	4426040	He could have gotten K cups from a pedophile company and, and, and actually
4426040	4427440	really stuck it to Keurig.
4427440	4427840	Yeah.
4427960	4429640	Somebody, I don't know who it is.
4429640	4432840	Somebody you can find it on my Twitter replies to that tweet.
4433200	4434240	I forget who it is.
4434240	4437400	Someone said, uh, that's why I get all my coffee from chock full of nambla.
4439520	4441760	I was a chock full of underage nuts.
4441800	4447920	The thing that I think is really funny is, is the idea of, of boycotting a
4447920	4450520	company for pulling at sponsorship.
4450520	4451600	I think that's really funny.
4452200	4456240	Like, because we're not really, that's, that's, it's already too complicated.
4456480	4459600	Like you don't think the company already did the math on this?
4459640	4461840	Like, like they're the ones with the most at stake.
4461840	4462840	You're so dumb.
4462840	4464960	You're smashing your own property.
4465200	4466960	Uh, I think it gets punishing someone.
4466960	4472640	They, they have accountants like, and PR people, like they crunched the numbers
4472640	4476320	and said, look, I wish we weren't in this situation, but the truth is we make a
4476320	4478800	penny more in the long run.
4478800	4481400	If we don't sponsor the pedophile show.
4481920	4485040	And, and, but, but also the funny thing about it is it's like you're, you're
4485040	4487120	punishing, you're punishing the free market.
4487120	4490160	You're punishing, like, you're punishing like a company just going,
4490200	4491680	just not doing anything.
4491720	4494320	You're just like, they're going like, well, we just don't want a lot of people
4494320	4495320	to be pulling our sponsors.
4495320	4499000	A lot of people's beef is that it's, it's, it looks like the optics of it
4499000	4502840	looked like that Keurig pulled their sponsorship after tweets.
4503520	4508520	Like, so, so, so say they did, how the fuck do you want a corporation to behave?
4509240	4512920	Liberals aren't this insane, you know, like, like there's a lot of dumb
4512920	4517400	liberals, like, like, like 85% of everybody is overreacting to everything at all
4517400	4523520	times, but it's just like the imitate, the right imitates the left and it's like
4523520	4525640	just bizarro, but they don't understand.
4525640	4528200	It's like you realize that there's sociopaths cause you go like, you
4528200	4532880	don't understand anything then because like, it's different to say, oh, these
4532880	4537200	are like, this is the list of sponsors for this thing that we don't like.
4537200	4539680	Okay, Uber, you're, you're in the crosshairs.
4539680	4540840	We're not going to take Uber.
4540840	4541680	Okay, everybody.
4541680	4542880	I'm deleting my Uber app.
4542880	4544280	Here's a video of me deleting it.
4544320	4547840	Hey, don't, don't sponsor Uber because Uber sponsors this thing.
4548000	4552400	And then you wait for Uber to cave or don't keep it like this idea of, because
4552600	4554760	they don't, they don't even have that.
4554760	4560240	They can't go to shows that aren't supporting pedophilia and then say like,
4560240	4564080	I'm going to stop using your ride, shared service until you support.
4564080	4568520	That's why Jeff's joke is so perfect because what are you trying to say other
4568520	4573000	than I only support companies who defend pedophilia monetarily?
4573040	4574920	Yeah, I mean, it's pretty insane.
4574920	4575640	It is insane.
4575640	4578760	I, I only want coffee, but everyone should have the right to defend
4579000	4581040	pedophilia and make me a delicious cup of coffee.
4581040	4581360	Right.
4581360	4584840	It's a, it's an absurd position, but that's their espoused position.
4584880	4588760	So either admission, I love people throwing their, their expensive machinery
4588760	4593200	off of a landing like under the sidewalk and it's like, it's not heavy
4593200	4594200	enough to be dramatic.
4594200	4594560	Yeah.
4594640	4595760	Also the guy's hammer thing.
4595760	4599160	It's like, there's a lot of internal cuts and that's a lot of internal edits.
4599360	4599840	Oh yeah.
4599840	4601080	To make it look like magic.
4601080	4603360	They had to go like, oh shit, I need a, I need some water.
4603640	4604560	Like I got to hydrate.
4604560	4605440	This has taken forever.
4605440	4608120	Like there's a lot of internal cuts where the thing keeps moving around.
4608120	4612440	And yeah, that guy bothered to reply to me after I was like, you know, aren't
4612440	4613720	you supposed to be using a bat?
4613760	4614600	What's with the goggles?
4614840	4618600	And then he was like, I was trying to show how silly something is or like
4618600	4622680	something like that, like he was being ironic about it, but he wasn't because
4622680	4626080	all he was talking about is how it was alleged and we can't do this.
4626120	4628240	But then he was saying, he was making a joke.
4628240	4630280	It's like, you're clearly not making a joke.
4630280	4635080	I, I convicted him of wearing sandals and socks and, uh, and, and, and a helmet.
4635360	4635680	Yeah.
4635720	4637360	That's the, you want shoes.
4637360	4640080	If you're going to be hammering something at your feet, you don't need
4640080	4643240	fucking a hard hat, what's going to fall on your fucking head.
4643240	4644160	I just also love the idea.
4644160	4645200	I'm so mad.
4645440	4648600	Boycotts don't work by you throwing out the thing that you already paid for it.
4648640	4651640	I mean, that was the Starbucks boycott was the same thing.
4651720	4653240	You're going to say Merry Christmas.
4653320	4654960	We're going to fucking buy coffee.
4655480	4656000	All of it.
4656000	4659240	Capitalism doesn't work when you demand the corporations pay
4659240	4661600	fealty to your ideological agenda.
4661880	4663320	It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.
4663320	4669080	Like it's a boycott is a, is a reaction when you, you're, you're, you're, you're
4669080	4673680	protesting a company, you're trying to say, let's hit them where it hurts in their
4673680	4674200	wallet.
4674200	4677840	So you go to the sponsor and say, we are not going to support your company as long
4677840	4681280	as you continue to make it financially possible for this person to blah, blah,
4681280	4684040	blah. That makes sense.
4684560	4689960	Nothing makes sense about the idea that, that coffee company is supposed to feel
4689960	4696120	bad or punished for not doing something they don't feel like doing.
4696360	4701280	Like they, they stopped advertising during the show because, so you're saying
4701280	4704760	like from now on, it's important that corporations really toe the line.
4704760	4708640	It's important that they, they, they, they, like, so, so you're a communist.
4708920	4711000	You're a fucking like, what are you like?
4711080	4712360	You're not a capitalist.
4712360	4715680	You're not, you're, aren't you going to be lecturing me about the free market two
4715680	4716440	days from now?
4716600	4718960	Isn't this whole thing about fucking money?
4719080	4720520	You suck at business.
4720520	4721760	You're an idiot.
4721960	4725200	You think we're going to, we're going to make money as a country at a world where
4725200	4731640	you demand coffee machines, love pedophilia or else you should demand that
4731640	4736600	they like coffee brother, because otherwise the country's going to go broke,
4736600	4737200	man.
4737200	4741160	Like, like, like, like, I just don't, I don't, I can't do it anymore.
4741160	4745160	I'm going to fucking shoot my dogs and then myself, your dogs will be fine.
4745720	4746480	Well, I'll shoot myself.
4746480	4748040	I'll let my dogs eat me like in Gerald's game.
4748080	4748280	Yeah.
4748280	4749280	I mean, the dogs will be fine.
4749800	4753560	Then they'll just die or go feral and, you know, kick ass.
4753600	4756160	I mean, that probably, they're probably going to be fine.
4756200	4758680	Like probably someone, no, Nigel will be fine.
4758680	4760560	Harvey won't know what the fuck to do on his own.
4760560	4762800	He'll die in the first Harvey, Harvey won't eat me.
4762800	4765760	Harvey, Harvey will watch Nigel eat me to the fucking bone.
4766000	4770520	Nigel, Nigel, I think if I sleep too late, Nigel would start nibbling my earlobes.
4771680	4773920	Nigel's Nigel's from the street.
4773920	4776480	Nigel's a fucking hardcore Echo Park baller.
4778480	4779760	He doesn't give a fuck.
4780120	4783440	He doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't even, it was just nice.
4783440	4788520	Cause when I come home from a long trip, like Harvey, you know, like Harvey went
4788520	4790160	through a submissive peeing phase.
4790160	4794920	Like Harvey is very emotionally like, um, vulnerable and stuff like that.
4794920	4796600	Harvey's very empathic.
4796600	4802280	When Nigel does something wrong and I yell at Nigel, Harvey like goes and it's sad
4802280	4805480	for Nigel and shit, but like that's, it's nice though.
4805480	4806840	Cause it's like, it has its advantages.
4806840	4810320	Cause I come home from a long trip and Nigel's just like, just same expression
4810320	4810760	on his face.
4810760	4811720	He's just like, who are you?
4811720	4812840	Do you want to play fetch?
4812880	4816800	You know, like he doesn't get it, but Harvey, yeah, Harvey's, Harvey's very connected.
4816840	4818560	Is he still late in the crash out of your meanders?
4818680	4822720	Yeah, I mean, he'll, yeah, I, I, I've been trained to, I've, I've
4822720	4824200	take better care of my underwear now.
4824200	4825600	You leave your undies in the air.
4825600	4828480	Like he's a bear with, it was food to hide your stuff.
4828480	4829600	Like on a high shelf.
4829640	4832000	I put everything up as high as I can.
4832000	4832320	Yeah.
4832960	4833640	That's great.
4833920	4834120	Yeah.
4834160	4834960	I'm glad to hear that.
4836760	4837000	Yeah.
4837000	4839600	I mean, you could just use like drawers, like, you know, where people put
4839600	4843120	their underwear away, toss your dirty underwear into some drawers.
4845760	4846680	Do you guys, my mom?
4846720	4847000	No.
4847000	4848640	I mean, I'm saying that's a bad idea.
4848840	4851000	Get all your clothes, dirty underwear in the drawer.
4851000	4851920	Yeah, that'd be weird.
4851920	4853320	Well, I have a hamper, a hamper.
4853320	4853640	There you go.
4855200	4855720	Yeah.
4855720	4856960	I wasn't going to make fun of that.
4856960	4859320	Is he nefarious enough to get into a hamper?
4859320	4862280	Would he knock a hamper over to get into those sweet delicious poopy undies?
4862320	4863080	I don't know.
4863080	4863360	Yeah.
4863360	4866560	I don't think he's done that yet, but sometimes, sometimes I swear I'm like,
4866560	4868680	I'm like, there's no way I left these underwear out.
4868720	4869840	Like, like, I don't know.
4869960	4872240	It's, it's, there's still like plausible deniability though.
4872240	4875520	Like where, oh, maybe I left them on the, the bathroom floor.
4877400	4880480	But yeah, he, he, he does some fucked up shit, man.
4880880	4882600	Like he knows it's wrong too.
4882600	4883720	Like he, it's so crazy.
4883720	4886120	How dogs know exactly what they're not supposed to do.
4886120	4888040	And then they're just, it's so weird.
4888040	4891240	Like you, you leave the room and then there's this, like, they're up on a
4891240	4895040	counter, like eating a bowl of cheese dip and then, and then you come in and
4895040	4897840	they're just like crazy at that too.
4898280	4901680	Like Nigel, you can tell a difference when he knows he's being observed and
4901680	4903400	when he doesn't think he's being observed.
4903400	4904840	Like it's really interesting.
4905160	4906960	He probably just wants attention, like a naughty child.
4907080	4908960	Well, no, he wants to get away with things.
4909000	4912160	Like he knows what he'll be, you know, told him not to do.
4912200	4912560	Yeah.
4912560	4917680	I had a, I, I, I, I, I, Cody's dog is staying with us a lot now, Barbara.
4917680	4920960	And, uh, Cody was gone and I was just sitting the three dogs.
4920960	4921400	Barbara.
4921440	4921960	Yeah.
4922400	4929200	And, uh, and, and I, I'm playing a Mario and then I hear this like crash and I
4929200	4935240	think, Oh God, Barbara, probably maybe the doggy doors barricaded, um, Barbara
4935240	4940640	maybe knocked the barricade over, maybe she's hurt, you know, it's a crash.
4940640	4944680	There was, I just, I, I was assuming it was coming from one place and I walked
4944680	4949120	from the room where I was playing the video game down towards where I assumed
4949120	4953280	the crash was coming from and along the way I passed my bedroom where Harvey
4953280	4957600	and Nigel are both going like, it's just so funny looking back at it.
4957600	4960960	Cause I was like, at the time I was like, I just noticed it, but like wasn't
4960960	4965200	thinking the two of them just had this expression on their faces.
4965200	4967840	Like, like, like, like, like the, the expression you'd have if you were
4967840	4971360	doing a line of Coke at a party and somebody like walked in, you know, they
4971360	4976080	just kind of like, were like, they just had this like weird forced, like, like
4976080	4977400	casualness to them.
4977400	4978840	Like, they're like, what's up, what's up?
4978840	4979800	Well, did you hear something?
4980160	4984600	And then I, and then I went downstairs and there was the doggy door was
4984600	4985760	fine and Barbara was fine.
4985760	4987520	And then I'm like, wait a minute, you two.
4987800	4991400	And I went up to the bedroom where they were like, like straightening their
4991400	4993760	ties and hanging out as I walked past.
4993800	4996640	And it was like, where the fuck did they even do?
4996720	5001680	There was like, there was a picture of me turned over on the nightstand.
5001720	5006360	Like, like, like, and there was a, there was a, there was a bunch of beverages
5006360	5009080	in, in the drawer of Cody's nightstand.
5009080	5012120	And, uh, it was just like, like, like, they was like, they were like, I don't
5012120	5015160	know, were they like making a forte or bomb?
5016000	5018880	The story didn't really end that great, but it was like, it's just, it's just
5018880	5020920	funny that those guys were like, inspiring.
5021160	5021640	Yeah.
5022760	5023240	I like it.
5024920	5026040	Steve, how's your love life?
5027240	5029280	You guys hear about these Chinese murder fans.
5030480	5030880	All right.
5030880	5033880	Well, what did we, did we talk through the D and D time?
5033880	5034720	No, no, we're good.
5035240	5035760	Let's discuss.
5036320	5037200	I've been away well.
5037200	5040280	And, uh, Brandon, he told me that he just texted me and said
5040280	5041280	he turned me into a caterer.
5041320	5041920	He was great.
5042440	5044600	Um, he said he turned down a lot of snacks for us.
5044600	5046800	Yeah, apparently I'm, I'm Chad.
5046920	5049040	The fireliker is now Chad, the snack bringer.
5049520	5051120	You cooked us some beef jerky.
5051520	5052640	I don't know how canon that was.
5052640	5053600	It wasn't beef jerky.
5053840	5054960	Oh, I guess it was beef jerky.
5054960	5056520	It was merballs was the main thing.
5056840	5057640	Merballs.
5057680	5062560	Which I, was it like myrrh, like the herb or like the, the gift to Jesus.
5063320	5063880	Same thing.
5064160	5064560	Anyway.
5064800	5066560	Um, you know, for net bronca has myrrh in it.
5066760	5067200	Really?
5067240	5067520	Yeah.
5069200	5069960	I can taste it.
5069960	5070840	Just thinking about it.
5071120	5071680	I don't know.
5071800	5072720	It's so strong.
5072840	5074080	It's like, uh, they dig.
5074160	5074560	Oh yeah.
5074560	5075120	It's like an essence.
5075120	5076000	They gave it to Jesus.
5076000	5077760	It's like an essence from like a root or a tree.
5077760	5080240	And it's like kind of a, like a very precious sap and, uh,
5080280	5085320	preservative and perfume and like kind of a healer kind of thing.
5085360	5089840	Did I talk about Floyd, the tree whisperer, uh, last episode?
5090000	5090600	I don't think so.
5091240	5094680	There's, there's shit going down with the, the, uh, is that the guy
5094680	5096200	that you waited for on Sunday?
5096240	5097760	The eucalyptus tree is the boots.
5098760	5099200	Yeah.
5099240	5102440	Well, it's, I mean, this is the, remember when she talked about the, of a well
5102440	5109280	respected arborist or whatever, like, yeah, I met that guy and he, uh, yeah, I could
5109280	5110560	swear I talked about this though.
5110800	5111520	I feel like you did.
5111520	5111800	Yeah.
5112400	5115280	I heard about, but I just don't remember if it was on the show or not.
5115320	5116400	Yeah, I don't remember if it was on the show.
5117960	5118760	Not on the show.
5118960	5119640	I thought so.
5120040	5124040	Well, this dude came out who looks like a teamster and a sleeveless shirt, but
5124040	5128880	then I started noticing things like, like his, his tattoos were kind of like.
5131680	5133720	Sorry, that was, I just, I hit the mistake.
5133720	5137320	That was, uh, well, I just noticed he had tattoos and they said, even though
5137320	5140320	he looked kind of straight laced, but then, and then also he had like blue
5140320	5144880	nail polish on it with like yellow moons on the, like somebody, somebody had
5144880	5150080	spent time on his nails and, uh, and then he said, he's talking about the
5150080	5154240	tree and how he can tell me if the tree needs to be cut down, which it does.
5154240	5158800	Cause it's dead, but then he, he, he, he, he needed to talk to the tree for a
5158800	5163400	second and as he stepped forward, he realized that the shirt he was wearing
5163400	5166520	was a, uh, Gallicado, a wonder woman shirt.
5166560	5170400	It was just the front didn't have anything on it, but then the back, that
5170400	5175520	was the greatest like reveal that he was wearing this like wonder woman shirt
5175520	5179520	the whole time, but he went over to talk to the tree, talked to the trees.
5179520	5184840	Like, he's like, this tree is like really sad and dying and dead and like,
5185080	5186360	did he put his hand on it?
5186360	5187560	Like, how does he talk to it?
5188280	5190440	Well, I didn't, I, that was my mistake.
5190440	5194040	Not his, but he also showed us, he's like, this is dangerous.
5194040	5199160	There's like this shit on it, like this kind of rot that, um, it's
5199160	5202960	like a fungus that grows on dead, uh, wood.
5202960	5207360	And it like, if, if, if the neighbor's kid like started playing with it,
5207360	5208360	it could get really sick.
5208360	5211400	Like it could, it could create, he said he got, he almost died once
5211400	5215560	cause he inhaled a bunch of it and it like grows a fungus in your lungs and stuff.
5215560	5217400	And that one, a tree attacks.
5217520	5221040	That's well, this, I mean, the tree has just been dying for a, for a long time.
5221040	5223520	It's like, you know, it's hollow.
5223560	5227080	You can, I mean, it's like the roots aren't even connected to the trunk.
5227080	5230160	It's, it's just this giant eucalyptus tree.
5230160	5233120	That's like leaning towards my neighbor's house and ready to fall on it.
5233960	5236320	$8,000 it will cost to cut it down.
5237120	5238000	Do you split that?
5238080	5238920	I don't know.
5239400	5240640	They have a landlord.
5241400	5243520	Is the word that it will fall over and crash into your, like,
5243560	5244960	like into your house and kill everybody?
5244960	5249400	Yeah, it will, it will, it will one day fall on my neighbor's house.
5249400	5250520	We had to cut down when I was a kid.
5250520	5253360	I grew up with these giant eucalyptus trees in our neighborhood.
5253360	5256400	And then I was a little kid intestine and there was like the garage and
5256400	5260640	like that side of the house and like a five foot gap and then the house.
5260680	5265040	And then in between that was a hill with a giant, like, you know,
5265440	5268080	a hundred foot eucalyptus tree or this giant tree.
5268480	5271680	And they cut it down and it fell exactly in between these,
5271680	5275680	these pros came in and did all this math and all this stuff and check the
5275680	5276640	windage and all this shit.
5276640	5278560	And it went right in between the houses.
5278880	5281600	If it had gone a foot, either way, it would have destroyed something.
5281600	5281800	Yeah.
5281800	5283320	I don't think they do like that anymore.
5283320	5285120	I think they do it in chunks from the top.
5285280	5287120	And that's why Floyd won't be a part of it.
5287160	5293040	Floyd Floyd said, he said, I come here to tell you that the tree wants to
5293040	5297200	be, needs to be cut down, needs to be, you know, put out of its misery or whatever.
5297520	5299880	And, uh, I won't do it myself.
5299880	5301000	I won't take that money.
5301000	5306720	I won't take that job because I, I, he said he characterized it like as he's gotten
5306720	5310080	older, he's learned to empathize with humans almost as much as trees.
5310240	5315880	And so he's really worried about the day laborers that you bring in to like,
5315880	5317360	these guys climb up.
5317360	5320960	If you, if you've ever seen these people bring down a big tree in Los Angeles,
5320960	5322000	it's harrowing.
5322520	5326240	Um, I, I, I understand what he's saying completely.
5326240	5328800	I can't believe that anyone asks anyone to do that job.
5328800	5329620	It's insane.
5329620	5335240	Like they go up with these, with ropes and, and they're just chainsawing
5335240	5337240	shit up there and they're tying things.
5337240	5339840	It's just like, it looks like a Cirque du Soleil act, but, but
5339840	5341160	designed to kill a human.
5341160	5347600	And I, so he doesn't want any part of that, but he demanded, uh, that I
5347600	5351200	notify him when we do decide to cut the tree down because he wants to come
5351200	5352680	out and do a memorial service.
5352760	5357880	So, which I definitely will be like recording.
5361240	5363160	I will, I will, I will not be mocking it.
5363160	5367040	I say I, but I will be, I will be sharing it with as many people as possible.
5367040	5369920	Cause I, cause this guy's definitely very interesting, dude.
5371480	5374000	I kept making jokes and he was just, he's just one of those guys.
5374000	5376280	It's just like, my jokes were not landing with this guy, you know?
5378320	5380600	Like I was, I was like, man, I feel really bad.
5380600	5384760	Like, cause I feel like I'm a party to this because I moved into this house
5384760	5386800	and I, I replaced the pipes.
5386840	5389000	There were clay pipes from 1929.
5389640	5393840	I mean, like this tree must have been so excited when I moved in,
5393840	5395720	taking all my nacho shits and stuff.
5395720	5398440	And now, and then I replaced the pipes with plastic.
5398440	5402960	So it's probably like, that's probably part of what, you know, I, I starved it out.
5403560	5408160	It was, it was roots were growing into my pipes and causing the sewage
5408160	5409560	to back up into my bathtub.
5411440	5413200	Let's play a little, uh, this D and D show.
5413400	5414120	All right.
5415360	5421480	D and D Dan, while Spencer, uh, hands down the, uh, the character sheets,
5422400	5426720	what was the sound that when you heard Barbara and Nigel knocking things over,
5426720	5428920	like, did you hear some sort of crash in the background?
5430640	5431240	Yeah.
5431840	5435520	I mean, I think it was this, did it go a little something like this?
5442680	5446960	Or maybe when you heard that, did you give a, did you make this response?
5446960	5454600	Uh, and then, and then you, uh, oh, I had a lot to eat today.
5454600	5461160	So did my dick just take a shit?
5463280	5464200	This is comedy.
5464200	5466000	You cannot find anywhere else.
5466000	5467520	This is top notch.
5467760	5473480	This is, this is public radio level FM.
5474440	5475320	I guess not public.
5477960	5481800	Yeah, I mean, it's been a bad episode, but this is good.
5481800	5483080	This is what the people want.
5483120	5484560	Oh, hello Dan Harmon.
5486280	5486800	Oh shit.
5486800	5487680	A dinosaur's on the phone.
5487960	5488960	That sounds like a plane.
5490400	5491960	Nobody wants a dinosaur on the fucking phone.
5492480	5493160	I think we will.
5493160	5497680	We need to add the functionality where we can, we can have, we can just go to the,
5497680	5502280	uh, subscribers and they can ask questions up on the screen and then we can answer them.
5502280	5502920	That'd be great.
5504440	5505240	So working on it.
5507400	5509240	Yeah, work harder.
5509880	5514880	This is, this is only gonna work on the people who are subscribing live, but
5514920	5518800	just once again, Cali is doing a kickstarter.
5518840	5520360	It's only got two days left.
5520840	5522440	It seems like she might not make it.
5523120	5524320	So donate.
5524800	5530160	It's important to me because we're financially linked as a result of being roommates.
5531360	5536360	And if you wait too long, I'll flush you down a toilet.
5537200	5539520	Kind of so good to be back you guys.
5539840	5540400	All right, Spence.
5540400	5541040	I really missed you.
5541160	5542120	Should we cue them up?
5542360	5543800	Let's, let's do that recap.
5543840	5547760	You guys remember Jeff doesn't remember what doesn't Jeff remember.
5547760	5551320	Do you want music for your recap or do you want to do this, uh, acapella?
5551360	5554360	I could do it either way, but answer my question before you start the music.
5554400	5556200	Um, let's see.
5556200	5557000	I have notes here.
5557760	5558320	Not your notes.
5558320	5559080	What do you remember?
5559880	5560280	Nothing.
5560880	5561960	It was a thousand years ago.
5562840	5564280	I promise it was not brother.
5564280	5565440	Absalon might have a mission.
5565440	5566240	I wrote down.
5566720	5567840	Do you remember what that means?
5567880	5568200	Nope.
5568360	5569760	A seminal horse adventure.
5569800	5572160	Oh, we're going out on the adventure of passions.
5572160	5572480	Jim.
5572520	5572760	Yeah.
5573480	5573880	Okay.
5574000	5574520	Okay, great.
5574520	5575600	So hit the music.
5575720	5578040	Even though you sounded less than thrilled about us choosing to go
5578040	5579040	on the adventure of passions.
5579040	5582360	Jim, if you'll recall, I often sound less than thrilled about most things.
5582360	5583000	Kind of your thing.
5583200	5583520	Yeah.
5584040	5584760	Cue this guy up.
5584800	5585160	All right.
5585160	5587440	Let's get some music up here for some Spencer's.
5590520	5595120	Last time on Harmon quest.
5596880	5597480	Harmon town.
5598120	5598760	Oh yeah.
5598760	5599760	I'm requested a TV show.
5599920	5600680	Oh shit.
5601880	5605920	I prefer last time on Harmon town.
5606840	5607600	What was happening?
5607800	5610200	Our heroes had completed their mission.
5610240	5613320	They returned to pure burn keep to turn it in.
5613320	5618720	And they had a debriefing with the guys who took patches to talk to him some
5618720	5621080	more, and you guys agreed to meet him.
5621360	5623280	And then you went to the tavern.
5623760	5628760	You tried appetizers at the tavern, but diarrhea junior could not be dissuaded
5628760	5633760	by the snacks and instead went to seek out pageants and he sought them out.
5633760	5637840	And he found pageants and pageants was pissed pageants was like, I just
5637840	5640040	want to tell you guys, fuck you guys.
5640080	5640840	And I'm leaving.
5641120	5643680	I got to handle my business and fuck you.
5644000	5644760	And he left.
5645120	5649880	And then diarrhea junior went back to the tavern and they discussed what to do.
5650200	5653400	And I think that Dan might've wanted to help him.
5653440	5655400	And then Jeff didn't want to help him for a while.
5655400	5657120	And then Jeff really wanted to help him.
5657480	5660760	And then Jeff went to help him and he summoned a horse.
5661280	5664880	Oh yeah, he summoned the horse and he found Patcheons and he
5664880	5666400	told him to wait right there.
5666640	5668360	And then he did wait right there.
5668640	5671280	And then they all arrived and talked to Patcheons.
5671320	5675120	And after a discussion, they agreed to join the quest for Patcheons.
5675120	5679040	Jim, now Dan.
5680720	5681240	Nice.
5681360	5681880	Thank you.
5681920	5682400	All right.
5682680	5687400	So after that was Brent Brandon played Chad, the fireliker for a little while,
5687400	5689320	but I did, did a whole lot get done.
5689320	5692400	Are you guys, you know, you agreed to do the quest and then Geffen showed up and
5692400	5696160	he was like, Hey, it seems like everyone at this town is on pot or some shit.
5696720	5697520	Which one's Geffen?
5697600	5702440	Geffen was the guy that remember he came up on a horse and then he, he, he threw
5702440	5704360	the, the prior horse.
5704480	5705080	It was white.
5705720	5710440	I don't think it was, I don't remember, but he threw, he, he can't, you'll recall
5710440	5715520	the prior ran away in a combat and Geffen showed up and was like, yo.
5715520	5717560	And then he tossed the prior down to you guys.
5717560	5718280	And then he left.
5718480	5721480	And then the debriefing, he also just made an appearance.
5722160	5722520	Right.
5722880	5727120	So now it's the three of us going on the adventure of Patcheons, Jim.
5727120	5727440	Right.
5727440	5731720	And we're arriving at this town, which is the place where we think
5731720	5738200	the, um, Banditos, uh, who were actually disguised as Banditos, but were in fact
5738800	5740880	guild professional assassins.
5740920	5745120	Um, they, they, they, we, we're, it's pretty clear they came from this town.
5745240	5746160	Dornester.
5746240	5750800	It seemed like they did because it was a very nearby town to the site of
5750800	5756680	burglary and it's a town of ruffs and, uh, brigands, you know, the kind of
5756680	5761080	people who commit crimes, the name of that town is what Dornester Dornester.
5761120	5765520	And I had, and Geffen has left us, but I said to him, you know, let us know if you
5765520	5774000	notice anything, um, you know, if you hear anything about a job that was, uh, taken
5774040	5779200	by any professionals involving waylaying strangers outside of town.
5779240	5779600	Right.
5779600	5780680	You had mentioned that to him.
5782400	5784840	But I didn't want to tell Geffen too much because we don't know if he's a good guy
5784840	5786800	or bad guy, and he could be one of those good guys.
5786800	5787800	It turns out to be a bad guy.
5787840	5788160	Right.
5788480	5788760	Okay.
5788760	5789960	So where do we stand right now?
5790240	5791480	We, are we on foot?
5791480	5792600	Are we, are we in Dornester?
5792600	5793240	Are we, are we on?
5793240	5794560	You're not in Dornester.
5794560	5797760	You had kind of, you had, I don't remember exactly.
5797760	5799600	You're certainly on the way to Dormaster.
5799600	5801240	So we were pretty close.
5801240	5801520	Yeah.
5801760	5803200	Oh, are we, are we traveling on foot?
5803240	5803920	We've got our wagon.
5803960	5804720	You're on foot.
5804760	5805000	All right.
5805000	5808600	As far as I understand, at the crest of a hill, you can see the town and the
5808600	5811960	outlying area below, you're kind of, yeah, you're at the crest of a hill.
5812280	5816840	Dornester is calm and quiet with only a few flickering lights visible in the night.
5816920	5822680	You can hear soft music as if from a lute that floats gently into your ears, a
5822680	5825120	haunting and mournful harp melody.
5825400	5826320	I guess it's not a lute.
5826400	5830520	It's a harp melody coming from the back Valley below you.
5831080	5833680	It's a, it's, it's, it's a weird time.
5833680	5834800	It's late in the night.
5835320	5836920	So it's a weird time to hear music.
5837040	5838240	Let's go to the concert.
5838920	5846120	Uh, is my, uh, my sort of arcane, um, how easy would it be for me to
5846560	5850120	recognize this as possibly magical beguiling music?
5850160	5853000	You know, do you have, uh, do you have any ranks in knowledge?
5853000	5853200	Okay.
5853200	5856200	No, I, I, I, I listened as close as I can, Spencer.
5858440	5858920	All right.
5859560	5863760	I have, I only, I only have, I only have ranks in knowledge, religion,
5864120	5867360	everything else is like checked off, but not, I don't have any numbers.
5867360	5867720	Right.
5867800	5873680	Um, what's your, uh, my intelligence is a mournful melody.
5873720	5874400	Seven.
5874720	5875200	Oof.
5875320	5875640	Yeah.
5876440	5881040	Um, it's certainly amazing music.
5881040	5884000	You can't define whether or not it's magical.
5884680	5887280	It's a, it's highly skilled whoever's playing it.
5887920	5889040	So we don't see who's playing.
5889280	5891640	No, it's, it's coming from really far away.
5892080	5892840	It's carrying on.
5892840	5893720	It's kind of repetitive.
5893720	5895000	It's kind of a one note song.
5895000	5896600	It sounds like a morning zoo team.
5897560	5898280	We got to go.
5898320	5899240	We got to see this.
5899320	5900040	I love music.
5900040	5900960	I love live music.
5902080	5902480	All right.
5902480	5903680	Let's check out the music.
5904680	5908560	A few more minutes of travel brings you to the edge of a very curious site,
5908720	5913320	a graveyard curious again, within the fence of the cemetery.
5913320	5919000	You can see skeletal undead creatures writhing along around the fence.
5919000	5922160	They're kind of inside the cemetery, kind of writhing around the fence.
5922360	5926920	The music plays on occasionally.
5926920	5929680	This is like one of those like Disney books where you press the
5929680	5931360	button of his face.
5932360	5934240	Um, yeah.
5934280	5935800	So the skeletal creatures.
5935840	5936200	Yeah.
5936200	5941120	Inside the graveyard, occasionally you can see one of the gravestar gravestones
5941120	5943200	in the cemetery topples over.
5943240	5946160	You're, you're still far off and nothing's noticed you yet.
5946280	5946560	Okay.
5946560	5947640	Everybody get down.
5949480	5953080	So, so, so want to be clear on this, what we're, what we're seeing, like the dead
5953080	5956080	rising for that's not why the gravestones are getting toppled over maybe.
5956080	5956440	Yeah.
5956440	5958120	That's, that's kind of what it's looking at.
5958160	5960480	And you said they're writhing against the fence.
5960480	5960800	Yeah.
5960800	5963320	They're kind of leaning up against the fence, but they're not like trying
5963320	5964440	to beat it down or anything.
5964440	5965400	They're leaning up against it.
5965400	5969360	You notice the cemetery is alive with movement in time with the music.
5969440	5971160	You can hear thudding and bumping.
5971200	5976160	They're dancing throughout the cemetery rumbling earth and shaking due off of grass.
5976480	5981080	The, the, the gravestones themselves are falling over as graves burst open and new
5981080	5983360	corpses burst forth from the soil.
5984160	5987040	They kind of get up and pull themselves out of the ground and start
5987040	5988680	wandering around a little bit.
5988680	5993120	But after a little tiny bit of wandering around, they kind of, they kind of lose
5993120	5995880	interest and just plop down on the soil.
5995880	5998920	Like take a seat or like lean up against something.
5998920	6002120	Most of them are just kind of hanging out, leaning up against the fences.
6002360	6005480	This music is so good that the dead wanted it.
6005640	6007120	They came back to life to hear it.
6007440	6007800	Hmm.
6008440	6010440	I look wistful, but mindless.
6010760	6014360	This doesn't look like a, something we want to just jump into.
6014360	6016520	I think we should watch.
6017640	6017960	Yeah.
6018160	6018520	Okay.
6019520	6021920	Do we see where the music's going from?
6022120	6025400	No, it's a lot louder now that you're by the graveyard, but you can't tell.
6025400	6028760	It's kind of like there's forest around and you can't really pinpoint a location.
6028800	6031280	Is it, um, it's nighttime.
6031280	6037560	Is it, is it to how it's called three in the morning, um, misty and foggy.
6037600	6043920	So there's absolutely no way to, we got people rising from their graves, getting
6043920	6047680	up, walking around for a second, and then just kind of losing interest and hanging
6047680	6048000	out.
6048320	6048640	Right.
6048640	6051800	So somebody's summoning the dead out of their, out of their graves, guys.
6052600	6052960	Yeah.
6052960	6055480	Spencer, do I have like enhanced hearing?
6055760	6056680	Do you have perception?
6059960	6061600	I have perception of four.
6062280	6064120	You have mildly enhanced hearing.
6065440	6065880	Do you want to?
6066040	6066320	Yeah.
6066320	6066520	Yeah.
6066520	6072000	I use my hearing to see or to listen for exactly where that music's coming from.
6072600	6073000	All right.
6073480	6074760	Um, you pinpoint it.
6074920	6079640	It seems like, uh, there's, there's a little bit of forest interposing the
6079640	6081480	graveyard and the town proper.
6081480	6085400	And it seems like it's coming from within one of the stands of, uh, trees.
6086960	6095440	Do you guys, I, I, it's, I think the heart is coming from inside those, that tree
6095440	6097280	area, should we go check it out?
6097280	6099160	Let's, let's, let's, let's sneak up over there.
6099240	6100560	You guys have stuff, right?
6100760	6102160	Uh, I got loads of stuff.
6102720	6103760	This guy's got loads of stuff.
6103760	6104400	No, no, I don't.
6105400	6106280	I don't have any stuff.
6106320	6106600	Right.
6106600	6107480	You're not bone weevil.
6107640	6109000	I have a five stealth.
6109240	6109640	Okay.
6109720	6110240	That's good.
6110600	6111720	Um, that might be the best.
6111760	6113440	Well, I think you should check it out.
6113440	6116240	Cause if we don't all want to bumble over there.
6116480	6121720	All right, Spence, I'm going to stealthily make my way to that tree.
6121880	6122280	All right.
6122280	6124760	If there's any trouble, come running back here.
6124760	6125080	Okay.
6125080	6125800	I'm a cleric.
6126600	6127280	Okay.
6127480	6128880	Dealing with zombies is my thing.
6128880	6131360	I just don't think you seem like friendly zombies.
6131360	6132440	Let's not attack them yet.
6133040	6136240	I, we don't have time for this conversation.
6137800	6139600	They're all chilling and listening to the music, man.
6139720	6142120	They're being commanded by someone.
6142120	6144800	I, that person probably has nefarious purposes.
6144800	6149000	These are, there's nothing nice about the undead.
6149200	6152360	They just follow orders.
6152560	6152760	Yeah.
6152800	6155320	Go, go, go sneak up and report back to us.
6155600	6156040	Okay.
6157040	6161200	You attempt to sneak up, but almost instantly you hear the music abruptly
6161200	6165120	stop and then from within the trees, you see a burst of Ruby light.
6165160	6169520	And then, uh, and then nothing it's, it's silent again, but the silence
6169520	6173400	is quickly overtaken by the sounds of zombies not being as chilled
6173400	6174600	out as they were before.
6174680	6175320	Oh no.
6175360	6177480	The music is grown in making noises.
6178920	6182560	Uh, how close, how close are, uh, Carlos and I to the zombies?
6182680	6184640	Uh, how far away do you want to be?
6185680	6188000	Uh, well, I mean pretty far.
6188120	6188480	Yeah.
6188760	6189960	50 yards.
6190000	6190360	Okay.
6190680	6194920	I'll say 50 yards, but, uh, Steve's, uh, much closer.
6194920	6196720	Let's say Steve's about 20 feet off.
6197040	6201720	So you guys are pretty far away kind of spying on Steve and he's, he's up trying
6201720	6204760	to creak, he was trying to creep kind of around or past the graveyard.
6205160	6207560	And how far is that Ruby light from where I was?
6207600	6211760	Uh, let's say 60 more than a hundred feet.
6212520	6213360	Oh, a hundred feet.
6214280	6215440	So it's not too far.
6215560	6218800	No, but yeah, it's not too far.
6219760	6224120	Um, but yeah, now, now the undead are starting to try and climb over the fence.
6224120	6226040	They're not, they're not very, uh, coordinated.
6226040	6226640	So it's hard.
6226640	6229720	And then others are trying to like rip open the fence and break it down.
6230200	6232720	If we get bitten by the undead, do them now.
6232840	6233240	Okay.
6233680	6236280	They just want to kill you and absorb your life essence.
6236520	6237560	Are they coming for us?
6238120	6240240	Uh, they're certainly, do they see us?
6240560	6244840	You can't do the, uh, you guys from your vantage point can tell that they can
6244840	6248520	see Steve because he's close, but you guys are apparently, or it
6248520	6251200	seems far enough away to be evading detection.
6251240	6253560	And how many, how many, uh, boogens we got right now?
6253560	6255360	Right now there's eight, eight boogens.
6256440	6258200	We can handle eight clumsy boogens.
6258400	6262040	Are they between me and that like, so I can't run back to check.
6262040	6262680	No, you can.
6262760	6265760	You're outside of the graveyard and they're still inside the graveyard.
6267440	6267760	Okay.
6267920	6269080	So they're not between me and them.
6269080	6270920	No, they're trying to be though.
6273160	6274080	Oh boy.
6274400	6277960	Um, all right.
6278000	6281640	I mean, in regular Dungeons and Dragons as a cleric, I would have this
6281640	6285160	power called turn on dead, you know, I think you should have it.
6285280	6286160	Can I see your sheet?
6286840	6287760	I know how to read these things.
6289080	6290160	I'm a real pro.
6290560	6290760	Yeah.
6290760	6291400	Turn on dead.
6291400	6293560	It's, it's on, it's in the middle ish there.
6293560	6293960	You see it?
6293960	6297240	I think under feats Spencer could have a different loadout from last time, but
6297240	6298440	I've had time to reset on that.
6298480	6299480	Yeah, absolutely.
6301160	6302720	And, uh, okay.
6302800	6303720	All right, fuck it.
6303760	6307160	Well, I'm, I'm down if you are, I mean, let's do this.
6307160	6308880	I got my offensive loadout right now.
6308880	6311640	I'm, I'm ready to kick boogin, but all right.
6313720	6319800	Um, does, does, does, does, does diary diarrhea look like he's
6319800	6321520	any, any, any danger right now?
6321960	6326360	He certainly seems to be like, uh, seems to be close to in danger.
6326400	6328800	I mean, he's certainly being threatened by undead.
6328800	6331000	They're just not like surrounding him.
6331080	6333720	Well, I say we take, I say we go on the offensive or they're still behind
6333720	6335440	the fence and we can take some pot shots at him.
6335480	6335800	Yeah.
6335840	6337200	Uh, w w w w w yeah.
6337200	6339040	We're w w w there's no point in stealth.
6339440	6342720	Well, let's just head for Steve and help him.
6344640	6345040	All right.
6345120	6346200	Well, Steve should go first.
6346200	6347200	Cause he's the closest.
6347880	6350040	I'm going to go toward the Ruby.
6350800	6351200	Okay.
6353000	6354360	Um, all right.
6354360	6354800	You do that.
6355400	6358720	You go, you can do a double move 60 feet.
6359040	6359320	All right.
6359320	6360520	You get about halfway there.
6360640	6362520	If you sprint, you could get all the way there.
6363320	6363600	Okay.
6363600	6364320	I'll sprint there.
6364400	6364720	All right.
6364720	6366280	You're winded, but you get there.
6366800	6375040	You can smell, um, it smells like, uh, mer and, but you don't really see anything.
6375040	6376560	There's no real footprints or anything.
6376560	6382320	You can see, um, there is a large, large, like stump tree stump, like of
6382320	6385400	a tree that's been cut down in recent times tree.
6385560	6388800	No, um, just like a big old tree stump.
6390640	6390920	All right.
6390920	6391440	That's your turn.
6393080	6393800	One of you guys go.
6393920	6398680	Um, 50 yards, that's 150 feet.
6398880	6399280	Okay.
6399280	6404920	Um, I say we get like in a battle formation with DJ so that we're close
6404920	6407600	together, or is it better to kind of do getting flanking positions and kind
6407600	6412520	of like, like, kind of have them cause the cemetery, a big square enclosure or
6412520	6412840	what is it?
6413000	6414800	It's a, it's, it's mostly square.
6414800	6420160	It's like a rectangle, but like how big from side to side, uh, 50 feet by 30 feet.
6420280	6420600	Okay.
6420640	6425400	Once I get within 30 feet of all of them, I have a chance to make any or all of them
6425400	6426000	flee.
6426560	6426840	Okay.
6426880	6429120	That's what they're still within the bounds.
6429120	6430240	I'll be right behind you.
6430280	6433960	Uh, and if, if, if I need to start throwing fire bolts, I'm right behind
6433960	6435520	you because you know, I like fire.
6441120	6441480	All right.
6441600	6443640	So you're 150 feet away.
6443680	6447560	It's going to take at least two turns to move into position if you sprint.
6447840	6448800	So, okay.
6449640	6450880	We'll take that first print.
6451200	6451640	All right.
6451640	6454240	You do that, you're, everyone's winded now.
6454280	6454760	It's great.
6454920	6456720	I mean, it's tiring, but it's great.
6457000	6461680	The undead, their turn to undead come over the fence and they're closing in on
6461680	6463720	diarrhea, but they're still not to them yet.
6463760	6467840	The other undead, there was eight, the other six undead break open the fence and
6467840	6472200	they're starting to spill out through the side of the fence, kind of now blocking
6472200	6476840	off diarrhea is a path to, um, Dan and Jeff.
6476840	6481080	So now you're kind of surrounding them in a way, but there's more of them than you.
6481640	6486880	So now it's, uh, let's, let's, let's, let's get these guys on the crossfire.
6486960	6489320	How far away from them are, am I?
6489360	6491120	You're 20 feet from the nearest to.
6492480	6493480	And they're moving pretty slowly.
6493520	6494000	Yeah.
6494040	6496120	The, these are, these are slow moving and dead.
6496120	6497560	They, they move very slowly.
6500320	6501400	Zombies.
6504440	6506080	If you want to think we can make someone else's.
6506080	6512600	No, no, I want to, I want to take out my bow and go for some head shots.
6514960	6519560	You know, from your clerical experience that headshots don't kill zombies.
6519560	6522760	Like in the walking dead, they don't, not one shot, at least.
6522760	6525920	I mean, there's still, it's damages damage, but it's not, what do I know?
6526440	6527400	Well, they're magic.
6527400	6530560	So, you know, you just kind of have to destroy the corpse.
6530560	6530840	All right.
6530840	6533280	Well, then I go for the easiest body part to hit.
6533560	6534040	All right.
6534760	6535960	Center of mass.
6536360	6537280	What's your attack bonus?
6539960	6543280	Uh, plus five.
6543320	6543640	Okay.
6544440	6545560	Time three for a crit.
6546840	6547680	What's the damage?
6549600	6550840	I don't remember anyone's shit.
6550840	6551800	I used to know all this.
6551800	6552880	Where does it say that?
6553000	6553560	Under the web.
6553920	6555680	128 plus two.
6555680	6556320	Is that possible?
6556320	6558080	One, two, one D eight.
6558120	6558680	One D eight.
6558680	6558920	Yeah.
6560440	6561120	What fun.
6565040	6566760	Listen into people read.
6567880	6568240	All right.
6568240	6569920	It's been a low key, low key episode.
6570240	6570600	Yeah.
6572600	6573160	Whatever.
6573600	6575800	You slice one of the zombies in half.
6575960	6577800	He goes down with an arrow.
6578040	6579640	Oh, wait, you're shooting him.
6580640	6581040	Okay.
6581080	6581520	My bow.
6581520	6583480	You don't, you shoot him.
6583840	6585200	It barely affects him.
6585640	6586400	Oh, damn it.
6586640	6587280	Oh man.
6588160	6590960	Well, it sinks right into his soft zombie flesh.
6591000	6592280	Should've used that sword, Jack.
6592480	6592760	Yeah.
6592760	6593760	That's what I thought was happening.
6593800	6594280	My bad.
6595000	6595560	That's okay.
6596160	6596680	All right.
6597280	6598400	Dan and or Jeff.
6599000	6599440	Take it down.
6599680	6606200	Uh, well, my goal is to get within 30 feet of as many of these guys as possible.
6606360	6606920	Uh-huh.
6607440	6612800	So you can do that, but you can't also act like you can sprint the rest of the
6612800	6616040	way, but you can't sprint and then get close enough.
6616040	6618600	Well, so I'll spend this term positioning myself.
6618600	6618840	Great.
6619360	6620160	You do that.
6620360	6624960	You put yourself into what you think will be exactly the space that the zombies will
6624960	6626880	be able to move into on their turn.
6627720	6628120	Okay.
6628200	6629640	I guess I, I guess I do the same thing.
6630360	6631880	It's tactically sound.
6633440	6633840	All right.
6633840	6638280	The zombies, they, uh, they come very close to you, but they can't, you know, you
6638280	6639360	really measured it, right?
6640440	6641480	What's our range right now?
6641640	6643760	Uh, you're within 10 feet of these guys.
6643760	6646640	So they've moved, they've made their move until it's back in our court right now.
6646640	6649160	They're kind of, yeah, they're right into your trap, so to speak.
6649160	6650080	If you're setting a trap.
6650400	6654760	The other zombie who's, uh, the other two zombies who are both not dead come
6654760	6658880	at, come at diarrhea, they're throwing hands.
6659800	6661080	Um, what's your armor class?
6663000	6669440	Um, it should be towards the top left, top left 21.
6669800	6670400	Oh shit.
6670400	6674780	They, they, they, they stab at you with their bony fingers, but it just
6674780	6678040	glances harmlessly off your, uh, your armor.
6678120	6680520	It's good armor and they're just zombies.
6680520	6685880	So because they're doing that kind of just full attack, Oh, you do see, this
6685880	6690600	is something I always forget, but as they approach you, you get an attack of
6690600	6693560	opportunity because they entered a space you threatened.
6693680	6694000	Yep.
6695320	6696600	Attack of opportunity.
6696600	6703280	What's your attack, uh, bonus for melee for melee.
6703320	6703720	Yeah.
6703720	6705040	Like the arrow one that you did.
6706080	6708000	Sorry, people for, for my full attack.
6708360	6709680	No, for your attack attack.
6709720	6710480	Just one of them.
6711320	6716120	Uh, for, when is my phone coming?
6717240	6720240	Uh, I think stay focused this next week.
6720240	6724720	I think within a week, within a week, I got my phone later than everybody.
6724800	6726480	I feel like you guys helping me.
6726480	6729640	I can't tell you how terrible I feel about it.
6729640	6735400	It's I have an iPhone X and I feel like that's the worst possible outcome.
6735400	6739400	Like I would rather you had mine and I got yours like weeks after you're
6739400	6743360	getting yours than what actually happened, which is me having one and you not have
6743360	6744840	it on Verizon.
6744840	6749920	So maybe that is why, because the second we could get an AT&T phone, it was two
6749920	6754160	weeks, but I did mine after that and it was like launch day Verizon.
6754440	6756760	So yeah, I think it was just AT&T.
6757480	6758240	Sorry, everybody.
6758280	6759840	Great tangent attack of opportunity.
6760120	6760840	It fails.
6760880	6764200	No, what Carlos attack.
6765000	6765440	All right.
6765640	6766480	Am I in position?
6766520	6766800	Yup.
6767440	6768320	Oh, hi.
6768320	6769560	Oh, flame.
6769560	6773960	Oh, not good gibberish.

6779240	6779760	Basic.
6780600	6781840	What UCB level are you?
6782560	6786280	Oh, great.
6786400	6787400	What am I chubby chase?

6805920	6806880	Turn.
6808080	6808560	All right.
6809520	6811880	Um, four of them flee.
6812400	6813960	Two of them don't flee.
6814000	6814640	What do they do?
6816000	6816560	They don't flee.
6817000	6817440	That's it.
6817560	6819000	So you, what's the spell called?
6819000	6820200	You just cast turn on dead.
6820240	6821120	Turn in the meeting.
6821120	6822680	They, they, they, they just turn and bone out.
6822720	6823880	It's more of a, they literally.
6823880	6824640	It's more of a feet.
6825560	6827400	They boned out.
6828080	6831160	Ah, feet's rarely fail me now.
6831240	6831480	All right.
6831480	6833800	So now we're done to what we're done to four boogers too.

6842040	6842680	What do I got?
6842680	6843680	I don't have my list for that.
6843680	6845640	Some of nature's ally.
6845680	6848040	I should get up in the morning.
6848480	6850440	Your daughter's going to college.
6850480	6854160	Get a cup of coffee from a company that lets you fuck her.
6854240	6854440	Hello.
6854440	6855880	I'm Sam Elliott for Keurig.
6857120	6860920	You know, just cause your daughter's going to cause me stool fuck.
6863720	6867680	I'm no good at child molestation until I've had my first cup.
6871080	6872000	Come to Keurig.
6872720	6877880	There's a saying in Alabama, early bird gets the
6877880	6880640	worm, the worm gets the early bird.
6880840	6884960	If you know what I mean, if there's grass in the field, it's time to play ball.
6887280	6892840	What level, uh, get out in front of your lover with the exciting
6892840	6895480	energy boost coffee cup.
6895520	6895800	Okay.
6896600	6901480	Dire rat, dolphin, dog, eagle, poison frog, giant centipede, fire beetle,
6901840	6904600	uh, pony, sturge, which is like a bat.
6904640	6905760	I'm going to summon pony.
6906240	6908040	I'm going to get on that pony and I'm going to fucking start.
6908040	6909800	Just a Palomino.
6910000	6910280	Oh yeah.
6910280	6910880	Palomino.
6911640	6912560	It's a Palomino.
6912600	6914600	Don't distract the kid.
6914680	6916160	Wait, is there a Palomino or just pony?
6916440	6917720	It's a nondescript horse.
6917720	6918960	It may very well be a pal.
6919000	6919240	Okay.
6919240	6921360	I'm going to get on that horse for two reasons.
6921360	6924760	One, because it gives me a better attack advantage and I know it's going to
6924760	6929200	make DJ fucking fire the hell up and stop failing all of his attacks of opportunity.
6929600	6931960	Oh, pony power.
6932960	6933880	I summon a horse.
6934600	6934920	All right.
6934920	6935560	Summon a horse.
6935560	6936720	What do you want the horse to do?
6936840	6940560	I want him to appear next to me and, uh, saddled up and ready for action.
6940680	6941040	All right.
6941040	6941680	It does that.
6941760	6942000	All right.
6942000	6942800	I get on the horse.
6943040	6943440	Okay.
6943440	6944200	Is that my whole move?
6944320	6946000	Yeah, but the horse can do something.
6946320	6953280	Um, uh, he tries to run the nearest one down, just like, just trample them.
6953360	6953720	Okay.
6955000	6955960	Can I name my horse?
6956480	6957680	Uh, yeah, you have to.
6957720	6957920	Yeah.
6957920	6960200	Um, Stewart.
6961040	6961440	Yeah.
6964600	6966880	You know, young girls are getting faster every day.
6972360	6973720	That means they're harder to catch.
6975320	6977360	But does it mean your coffee can't be delicious?
6980200	6981200	It all new correct.
6981200	6982160	5,000.
6982920	6984400	No hammer can take it apart.
6984880	6989200	You can throw it off any apartment building for four and lower.
6990520	6993040	And I'll be darned if the coffee isn't still just as piping
6993040	6994360	hot and good as it can be.
6995040	6996520	Hey, it's your coffee.
6996920	6998520	We just support pedophilia.
6999760	7000240	We do eat.
7000240	7000920	No, we don't anymore.
7000960	7001480	Well, we don't.
7001520	7003360	Yeah, this is, this is the company.
7003560	7004440	We're the coffee company.
7004440	7011480	It doesn't care what you watch the world that that guy wants to live in.
7011480	7011720	Right.
7011760	7013240	Like the, yeah.
7015320	7016800	Just cause we're dedicated to profit.
7016800	7018560	Doesn't mean we can't have an agenda.
7019240	7021640	And then we want that agenda to be as criminal as possible.
7021680	7021960	Hello.
7021960	7022360	I'm Mr.
7022360	7022880	Coffee.
7024160	7025880	I support pedophilia 100%.
7028320	7030760	You know, the age of consent in Mr.
7030760	7034960	Coffee's land of origin is a ripe 11.
7036840	7037480	It's true.
7037800	7038680	I'm British.
7041520	7042200	Look it up.
7042280	7043080	Let's get back to work here.
7043080	7043520	All right.
7043520	7047320	So you run one of the, you, you try to run two of them over you, you
7047320	7051440	knock them both down, but you only really like stomp on one of them.
7051440	7053400	So you stop one of them to death.
7053440	7054120	Oh shit.
7054560	7055480	Dealing five damage.
7055480	7055840	Way to go.
7055840	7056280	Stewart.
7056280	7058040	I give him a nice little, little, little pat.
7058280	7058840	Oh yeah.
7058840	7059600	He's digging it.
7059640	7060160	He likes that.
7060520	7060920	Yeah.
7060920	7064480	The other one, uh, the other one kind of gets knocked over, but it's not dead.
7064480	7067520	I continue my ride and kind of circle back into action, kind of re reposition.
7067560	7067960	All right.
7068480	7069120	Yeah.
7069920	7071680	And Dan went zombies.
7071720	7072080	Okay.
7072440	7073480	The zombies attack.
7073520	7074440	They attack Dan.
7078240	7079400	Oh shit.
7079400	7079720	Sorry.
7079800	7080480	Was that my fault?
7081000	7083320	Was my sound effects so good that it made them critical hit.
7083360	7084520	You take 12 damage.
7084520	7085360	Jesus.
7085600	7086080	Oh no.
7086080	7090400	You have to endow that zombie with such a bellicose.
7094840	7095680	What was that?
7095960	7096720	That's man.
7096760	7098200	It's, it's called game over.
7098760	7099800	Yeah, I guess it was.
7100680	7101360	Um, all right.
7101400	7104120	And, and Steve also gets attacked by two zombies.
7104120	7105760	One of them smacks you in the face.
7106120	7106680	Ouch.
7106720	7107720	Four damage.
7108200	7111160	So it was just one zombie took, got me for 12.
7111160	7111760	It was a critical.
7111760	7112000	Yeah.
7112200	7113520	And I rolled really high.
7113520	7116280	Does it leave any cool scars like battle scars?
7116320	7118760	It only leaves a really embarrassing scar.
7120120	7120920	What a bummer.
7121120	7126440	It's like a cup Mark on your purple circle on your butt.
7126800	7127320	All right.
7127480	7127800	All right.
7127800	7128400	Go for it.
7129600	7130480	Uh, who's sure?
7130560	7131480	I think DJ.
7132920	7135000	Um, can I do so?
7135000	7136360	How many are by me to two?
7137360	7142880	Can I attack both of them with my Elvish blade?
7143480	7143960	Yeah.
7143960	7145000	What's your full attack now?
7146080	7146920	My full attack.
7146920	7147040	Yeah.
7147040	7149760	You can full attack at this point plus five plus five.
7149840	7150240	Awesome.
7152600	7152960	All right.
7152960	7154000	You hit with both.
7154080	7155440	What's the damage on the full attack?
7156800	7160800	Uh, one D 10 plus one D six plus eight.
7162160	7162800	It is 10 o'clock.
7162800	7163440	Just so you guys know.
7165040	7165400	Oh man.
7165400	7166480	You cut them both down.
7166800	7170240	You smash one in the head with your shield and slice the other one in half.
7170680	7171680	Boom.
7177720	7178320	You like that one.
7178440	7178680	Yeah.
7178680	7180760	Well, it was, I mean, that was very appropriate.
7180760	7185080	It was sort of like, like it turned, it turned role playing into like a sports
7185080	7186920	event, man.
7186920	7190960	There's a guy who makes an app for this for DMing and he'd be so pissed if we
7190960	7194440	knew he knew we were just using a soundboard and not his crazy app that he
7194440	7195200	gave me for free.
7195200	7195880	I want the app.
7196320	7197760	I don't, it's a lot of work.
7197800	7198080	Okay.
7198080	7199120	And I don't, I don't want that.
7199120	7200960	No, I mean, oh, you could do it.
7201480	7203000	You could, this is a great idea.
7203160	7204240	You could do the music.
7206280	7207280	It's a bad call.
7208080	7208960	I don't know what that was going to be.
7209200	7214600	Put a, put a window in the windowless van of your fatigue with curd coffee.
7217640	7218760	You don't want windows.
7220160	7221320	Eliminate the window.
7221520	7222120	There you go.
7223760	7224520	I'm exhausted.
7225440	7230240	You know, your van sitting all day in your van outside the kindergarten is awful
7230240	7230760	tiresome.
7231440	7235240	That's where I turned to the cool refreshing cup of curd coffee.
7237880	7241200	If child blood was, it came out of the faucet.
7241720	7242120	Let's go.
7242160	7243680	We wouldn't need coffee.
7245840	7247520	Here's to the rest of us.
7248600	7251040	I guess I'm, I guess I'm graduating the guy to murder.
7252000	7254440	Nice.
7254600	7254920	All right.
7255000	7260160	So, uh, so where are we at?
7260440	7262120	Uh, you guys are having a turn.
7262240	7262560	Okay.
7262560	7263880	There's one zombie left.
7264240	7265160	Uh, one zombie left.
7265200	7270920	Um, do one of my spells says, um, fire blade, but I don't think I have a
7270920	7272040	sword other than my knife.
7272040	7273840	Do it conjures a fire blade.
7273840	7275720	Oh, well then I'm riding around on Stewart, the horse.
7275720	7277640	I want to conjure a fire blade and finish the job.
7277720	7278120	All right.
7278800	7280080	Fire blade.
7280280	7282080	Do you know how much damage the fire blade does?
7282720	7285240	Uh, it probably does.
7285240	7286840	One, the bag of just two ages.
7286840	7288720	It says smiling dick on it.
7291240	7292440	Uh, fire blade.
7292440	7292840	Where are you?
7293160	7294080	Show me, show yourself.
7294080	7295200	Fire blade flame blade.
7295560	7300720	Uh, it's a one, one D eight plus one for two spell.
7300720	7300840	Yeah.
7300840	7302480	So one day it was one off.
7302880	7303320	All right.
7303960	7308720	You, you slice it right in the neck and it catches fire.
7308800	7312720	Holy fire, like a silver flame.
7312720	7314720	It catches silver flames.
7316320	7318560	And, uh, the silver flames consume it.
7318600	7322920	It's like, uh, oh yeah, it, it, it burns to fine white ash.
7322920	7327080	It's way hotter than a normal fire would be fucking flame blade.
7327240	7327520	Yeah.
7327560	7329560	Now am I just left holding a flame blade for the next two
7329560	7330160	minutes or what?
7330240	7331000	For a couple of turns.
7331000	7331160	Yeah.
7331240	7331360	Yeah.
7331360	7331640	Okay.
7331720	7333720	What happens if you smoke that ash?
7334360	7337160	Uh, that's, you can't just muse.
7337240	7340240	I kind of want to, I want to be like the guy in flesh and blood.
7340240	7343280	There's this movie flesh and blood with Rutger Hauer and Jennifer Jason Lee.
7343280	7346640	It's like really awesome, like medieval, um, movie.
7347000	7355120	Um, and there's like a cleric kind of guy in it and, uh, this is my impression of him.
7356720	7360240	I see a sign from the gods.
7360720	7366520	I see a silver flame consuming the rotting flesh of our enemy.
7366960	7371320	And I see Chad, the firelighter holding that flame.
7372000	7373960	This is our destiny.
7374320	7380120	We are here to conquer cliffhanger.
7380320	7381240	We did it, everybody.
7381800	7383560	Where's that music or come on, give me some music.
7384480	7385160	There we go.
7385640	7386280	We did it again.
7386280	7387240	Let's watch the TV.
7387240	7389720	Everybody's in blood with Rutger Hauer and Jennifer Jason Lee.
7389800	7390840	That was an amazing ending.
7391840	7393440	It's a little sexually problematic.
7393440	7400480	It's kind of like slightly to the misogynistic side of Peckinpah, but, but it's still a really
7400480	7404160	cool movie if, uh, you know, you don't get enough D and D in movies.
7404320	7405160	Let's thank everybody here.
7405160	7408600	We got Zach and Kevin and Sarah and Ellen, Kevin and everybody.
7408600	7410080	No, not Kevin, Chris, God dammit.
7410440	7412080	And, uh, how about, uh, me?
7412120	7414000	I'm your, uh, comptroller, Jeff Davis.
7414200	7415480	Thank you for having me back, everybody.
7415760	7418760	Let's see ever Spencer Crichton, the game master extraordinaire.
7420720	7422640	Church on photos where she's gone.
7423960	7424640	We did it again.
7424720	7426040	Uh, Dan rapping his heart away.
7426040	7427240	Dan Harmon, your mayor, everybody.
7427240	7428120	Thank you so much for coming.
7428640	7431400	We'll see you on the flip flop fast.
7432120	7433200	Take chances.
7433480	7433960	Good night, all.
7451960	7452800	Did you get any of that?
7453440	7456200	It's a good show.
