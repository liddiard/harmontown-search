13320	26680	Hollywood, California, Meltdown Comics, the Nerd Melt Theater, the 100-Harmon Town episode.
26680	33240	Our Centipodio Centepisode.
33240	36680	Harmon Town is now obsessed.
36680	42280	Let's walk on the stage, the mayor of Harmon Town, Forever Young, Forever Fit, Forever Charming.
42280	46840	Jen Harmon!
46840	49960	Thank you!
49960	53160	Centipisodio!
53160	55640	100 episodes.
55720	65720	Tonight will be, I promise, at least one percent as entertaining as the sum of all of our podcasts' parts.
65720	72120	Nothing really special planned, except for, uh, sorry, sorry, goodnight.
72120	76040	What he meant to say is, boy, do we have a show for you people tonight!
76040	77960	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
77960	83480	I mean, I'll make it special in any way that you want me to make it special, but it's not like the show is, uh...
84280	87800	Eh, it's like this.
87800	92680	The, uh, I mean, the show is, uh, the show is not famous for its preparation.
92680	99400	I was afraid, you know, the, you know, in doing things, special things, that we would just be,
99400	103560	I think that would run kind of, what's the word, anathema?
103560	104360	Yeah, yeah.
104360	106040	It wouldn't really be a Harmon Town episode.
106040	111000	We're gonna make this a hundred, a hundred times the Harmon Town episode,
111000	116840	which means we have to plan a hundred times less than we ever do.
116840	119400	How could, how could you plan a hundred times less than zero?
121080	125720	It's just, that's it. It's just a regular episode, see? The math, the math checks out.
128120	131480	Hey, Jeff, what do you, what do you make of these? What do you make of these people?
132360	136920	I've been watching some more true, true crime shows with, uh, Aaron.
136920	142120	I, uh, like, uh, we just, you're, you're, what, you're, you know, I, I used to watch
142120	146840	the forensic files and the FBI files and the forensics, uh, extreme forensics,
146840	158120	solved, colon, forensics gone wrong, wild, wild crime, snapped, semi-colon, women, women of forensics.
159800	162680	Like, like the Dateline kind of things, those, those, those murders?
162680	168600	Yeah. That gets a little like, uh, polished for me, but, but, but, uh, we start, we started
168600	172920	watching this show, which I think we're done with now. I think there's only six episodes of it.
172920	179000	It's called Murder Comes to Town. And it's, it's just like every other show, it's all the same
179000	183640	murders and stuff, but the focus is on the town. So it's like, it's just sort of like, it's just,
183640	187480	it's just like any other kind of like crime show where there's just interviews with these
187480	190920	police that couldn't figure out who killed somebody until someone called and told them
190920	194280	that they did it, which is, if you really watch these shows, that's what always happens. Like,
194280	198360	there's always, there's always a, there's always, uh, three quarters of the way into the episode.
198360	203400	And then they got a break. Yeah. Then police got the break they were looking for. And it's
203400	208600	always like a phone call from either a nearby, uh, police enforcement agency saying like,
208600	215560	we found a finger, uh, you, uh, or it's just a guy going like my cousin did it. Um, but anyways,
215560	223080	not to digress tonight, no tangents, a hundred times less tangents than, than normal. I was just
223080	226360	waiting cause we were watching cause there's always the reenactments in these things. So they
226360	232040	show people, uh, the people are the, there's people talking to the camera and then sometimes
232040	237960	there's people that they hired to play those people. But then sometimes as in Murder Comes
237960	242280	to Town, and I think it's at a case by case basis, I think I'm assuming it's, it's based on the
242280	249800	participant's, uh, willingness. Um, the, uh, sometimes the person that's, that's being
249800	255800	interviewed is then in the reenactments. Yeah. So they'll show a woman going like, well,
255800	260360	yeah, my daughter, then my, my daughter was missing. She was gone. And then they'll show
260360	266200	that woman waking up in a bed, you know, and there's like a giant Johnny mnemonic poster
266200	271640	on the wall to make it period or whatever. Because it's 10 years later, but this poor
271640	277400	woman is like answering a phone going, hello, no, no. Okay. I'll be right there. And like
277400	280760	hanging up the phone. It's like, like there's a director telling her, okay, your daughter's
280760	286120	missing. Like it's a, it's a cop on the other end of the phone. Sweetie, sweetie, work with me.
286120	290440	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What the director, uh, what's my motivation? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
290440	294280	And then, and then including like, we were really like tripping out of this one. It was like this,
294280	298600	this good natured, seeming like loving mother whose daughter had been abducted and eventually
298600	302840	murdered because the show's called murdered comes to town. Don't, don't hit me with your spoiler,
303400	307960	uh, shed at the shows called murder comes to town. It's the daughter's missing and she's, she got
307960	313800	murdered. But the, and the woman is like, like, like, so they should, they, they show her reenacting
313800	319080	the moment where she found out her daughter's missing. Then they also show her like, like,
319080	324760	like, like the day that she last saw her daughter alive. So they show her like walking down a hall
324760	331240	opening a bathroom door and go, sweetie, I'm going to work. Okay, mom. Bye. Like, like,
332280	335960	there's the director then called, he goes, Hey, Monica, could you stop crying in the middle of
335960	342040	this? At the time this scene takes place, your daughter's still alive. I don't know why you
342040	351000	keep bursting into tears. Where were those in the last scene? Uh, it's just, I can't even,
351000	355560	to be a fly on the wall of that production. These people are just, it's just random people.
355560	359800	And sometimes it's like cops, like the cops, you know, they're into it when the cop is like
359800	365480	putting the guy in the hood and he's like, don't move pal. Don't even breathe. Uh, and he's all,
365480	371080	you know, he's playing himself and trying to act like he was like, you know, die hard. Is that the
371160	382760	character's name? You're thinking of Jaws. Yeah. Uh, do you get a question, Jeff? Uh, yes. Dan, uh,
384120	389160	what does it all mean? There was a quote in the show that there was a murder that took place in
389160	394440	Kansas or something. And then the narrator said, this is the narration is like incredibly poorly
394440	397640	written. Like they'll do things like, they'll go, there was this one I had to rewind. It was like,
397640	403320	did they just use suspicion as the, as the dramatic button on the end of two sentences in a row?
403320	409480	So it was like, uh, like, uh, but then there's only a matter of time before hope gives way to
409480	416520	suspicion. And the hopes and dreams that were pinned on the former family members give rise
416520	422760	to suspicion. Like he acted like he never said suspicion before. Like they just, they're just
422760	427480	fucking, they're like, we don't, we don't have time to say shit about murder. I know it's been done
427480	432280	a million times. Who's that white haired guy? Uh, uh, uh, Keith, no, no, what's the fuck with the,
432280	436920	the creepy, the ghoulish guy that they've done on SNL. Yeah. Yeah. Like that, what's his name?
436920	440280	Bill hated us. And like that guy, he's, it's the worst writing in the world because it's all
440280	446040	questions. Um, why did she go there? And if she went in there, why did she do it? Well, listen,
446040	449480	I always wonder too about the people that participate in these shows. So they're doing
449480	453320	these interviews and they're talking about their beloved person being killed and how that,
453320	457320	what it was like to find their brains in the, in the thing. And, um, and then, and then they're
457320	461400	doing these interviews and they're crying during them. And then the, but some, sometimes the show
461400	468440	is called like, like peekaboo, I killed you, you know, like, it's like not quite on the side of
468440	473800	the victim. Exactly. It's more on the side of murder kind of like, like, like that's what the
473800	479320	murder comes to town. The narration is like the guy is like decidedly, he's like, but what happened,
480040	486440	she went jogging. That's the last time, uh, anyone saw her, but no amount of jogging would keep her
486440	493080	alive during her rape and murder. That was like, like, like, what are you making fun of her for
493080	499000	dying? Like, oh, she was jogging. Get it? Like, like, what if you were the, the, the mom and you
499000	503240	saw that and you'd be like, I cried in that interview. They told me to look at the camera
503240	507240	and cry. You say that you watched all these episodes, meaning had there been more, you would,
507960	511480	there were six of them. Yeah, I think they canceled it, but I'm yeah, I'll do more because
512520	516120	because the other ones are all, I feel like I've seen the same murders and stuff and there's like,
516120	519880	it reduces the viewer to this weird thing. Like Aaron and I were like, you know, going through
519880	529880	the, uh, the menu and we're like, two elderly people missing in a truck. Well, this is one girl,
529880	534600	but you know, you, you know, you know, an ex-boyfriend just murdered her. Like, like,
534680	539560	you kind of like, you know, you're reduced to fictionalizing human beings. But anyways,
539560	543640	one more thing about this, the, the horrible narration, I wrote this down. The guy said,
543640	547960	he was, he was talking about the town, the town, it's always about the town is the town couldn't,
547960	551960	that's the gimmick of this show. The town couldn't believe it. This town and a size, this town,
552920	557800	this kind of murder, you never, you don't forget it. Um, uh, like in New York, everyone's like,
557800	567640	Hey, uh, Glenn's missing. Fuck it. I think that's why they break New York into like smaller
567640	572600	subsections, right? So that, you know, it's, it's, it's an appeal to the people outside New York
572600	576280	for a little bit of humanity. Like, like, like, look, look, we're not just a giant city full of
576280	584440	people. If, if my neighbor gets killed, I care. Uh, because I'm from Brooklyn section three.
584440	590120	Anyway, see the guy, did they ever find Glenn? The guy, the guy, the guy who's saying,
590760	597400	but it, uh, you know, boner, boner hurt, uh, Kansas, boner hurt.
599240	605160	Okay. We'll get back to your, your naming, boner hurt. They'll still show a shot of the water tower
605160	611560	and, uh, and then a cornfield boner hurt. Kansas is a quiet town full of church going folk. And
611560	616200	this is what the guy said. He said, you could call it the core of the American heartland.
619480	625720	You can call the word heartland synonymous with core. You could call a heart a core. You could
625720	631000	call a core a heart. You could clean up this sentence, motherfucker. You could call this
631000	636440	town in Kansas, the core of the big apple, but not, but, but very far away from that, from that
636440	642520	apple. You could call it the center of the epicenter, a kind of confluence of nexuses.
647160	651160	Boner hurt Kansas lies at the intersection of crossroads.
653640	660200	Is it five o'clock yet? All right. So, uh, well we got, we have, we have special
660200	663160	shit to do and I know it's gonna, you know, it's gonna eat away at us.
663160	666440	It's gonna eat away at our time. It's not gonna eat away at us.
667480	670920	Before we go real quickly, I, I've been reading these books that are like, uh,
671720	677080	by Philip Kerr. They're all these about detective novels set in, uh, in World War II Germany. It's
677080	682120	a detective, like kind of a la Raymond Chandler, and he is a cop during, uh, World War II. It's
682120	687960	great shit. It's just like awesome schlock, but also like I, I love, I love World War II documentaries
687960	693880	and I love Nazi documentaries. And I feel like I, in my, I know this is not a charming admission,
693880	699080	but like, is it wrong to wish that World War II had gone on longer so there'd be more documentaries
699080	704040	about it? I mean, that's what, that's what TV does to us. Yeah. Because it just, like,
704040	707320	some channels should just be called just like, we love Hitler documentaries.
708360	715160	I saw, I Instagrammed it. There was the, uh, I swear to God I did. How can we prove this, Dan?
715160	719960	There was, I was just, I was going through, I was looking for a new, uh, app to play on my
719960	727160	fucking fat slob pad that I sit in bed and eat donuts on while I watch murder shows. Um,
727160	731800	and I came across a review of this Sims game where this woman was like, she was, it was just
731800	738040	like an eight paragraph essay about how the, they had, they had updated the free Sims game that she
738040	742200	had been, that she had raised her grandchildren on. Uh, cause she's like, my grandchildren would
742200	745960	come over and when they were three, they used to like to just watch the people walk around. And as
745960	751080	they grew older, they learned about how to interact. So she's like, she's, believe me,
751080	756520	her opinion matters the most about this free game that she's been fucking because she uses it to
756520	762200	raise children. Um, and then they released an update that makes the Sims die of old age. They
762200	767960	used to be immortal, Jeff, and now they die of old age. And, and I was talking to them about it and
767960	772760	someone was putting photos of the groom Reaper on, on their Facebook pages and they saw them and
772760	776360	they started to cry. Now my grandchildren are crying. I don't understand why these Sims have
776360	780600	to die. I thought they could live forever. And she's like having a fucking nervous breakdown
780600	789560	in a review under the app. Was this review helpful? Uh, I, yes. Uh, it, it, it, it has,
789560	796680	it has summed up our universe entirely. Uh, I don't know if it's helpful to anyone, but maybe
796680	804040	Nietzsche or Kafka, but it's like, I mean, she was like, she had become more sim than human
804040	809480	because the Sims were now capable of dying. And she was just this weird program complaining
811000	817160	boy. Anyways, but yeah, I'm just a hop from that with these murder shows now. Teenage hitchhiker.
817160	822760	The Sims couldn't die. I played the Sims for like three days. And the woman that was my,
822760	827400	like my, my avatar, my gal or whatever, she just kept getting bummed out and there's flies in the
827400	832760	kitchen and I hated it because I thought I'd kill her. So I just, I just stopped doing it. You can't,
832760	836280	you couldn't kill it. She would just sit there and be miserable for the rest of time. Yeah. I don't,
836280	839960	I can't, I don't know. I can't answer anyone's questions about the Sims, but how do they die
839960	844440	now? Like old days, like you have to wait 80 years or do you have to like, I don't, I don't,
844440	849240	I never played a Sims game. I'm, I'm, I'm neither proud nor ashamed to say I love, I love, like,
849720	857080	I play like gardening mama too. I'm not above reproach. Aaron, Aaron bought me in New York.
857080	860760	We went to the Nintendo store. She said, you'll like this game and gave me gardening mama too.
861320	863800	And I was like, fuck you. I get your joke. And then I kind of liked it.
866360	869320	She always, she always leans over and looks at my screen at the wrong time. It's like,
869320	873880	I'm always like in the middle of like changing a diaper or helping a stork grow or, you know,
873880	877880	it's, I like, I like like time management games and like gardening. I like gardening and
878600	883960	not in real life. All right. Speaking of bad writing, just what we were driving here and
883960	890280	Aaron played rocket man. I just, so you'll, you'll know how to finish these lyrics. Mars ain't the
890280	896440	kind of place to raise your kids. In fact, it's cold as hell. And there's no one there to raise
896440	902360	them. If you did, if you did what raise them. Yeah. You just said it's no place to raise your kids.
902920	908520	There's no one there to raise them if you raised them. Well, except you. What is it? Is that,
908520	912920	is that just Elton John doesn't know a life outside of the nanny system? It's like,
912920	916840	it's like, oh man, Mars ain't the kind of place to have your nanny raise your kids for you.
917720	922440	There's no nannies on Mars. It's the kind of place to raise your kid. In fact, it's cold as hell.
923000	929960	And there's no one there to raise them. If you did, dot, dot, dot. If you raise your kids there.
930200	934040	All right. If you did, choose that lifestyle.
936600	940360	Raise your kid. Oh, Mars ain't the kind of place to settle down and raise your kids.
940360	946440	Yeah. Uh, no, still not, still bad writing. Uh, musicians, 6,000 years are getting away with
946440	950680	bad writing and counting because they bang on things while they do it. There's a hand being
950680	959240	raised out there. Do you dig? Are you just guessing that? You're, oh, you always thought
959240	968040	it was, if you dig, someone look it up. Look up lyrics for us right now. If you dig, if you dig,
970120	976120	there's no one there to raise them. If you did, he's just checking it. I'll fucking give you,
976120	982360	it's the Elton John equivalent of, you know what I mean? $10 is yours, sir. If it's,
982920	989800	it did. Thank you. We saved me $10. This is a sea of iPhones. Did you dig? I wish that was it.
991800	995160	Yeah. Okay. All right. I think that's, that's better. All right. Let's, let's, let's,
995160	998360	let's, let's move on, uh, to crocodile rock. Now this song.
1000920	1006760	Crocodile rock. I just, I always, I get so mad at musicians because they get away with like stuff
1006760	1012200	that, uh, you know, I don't know. They're just kind of like, they're so fancy and free with their
1012200	1016360	goddamn lyrics. And it seems like it's part of their success. Like people don't want my
1016360	1020760	overwrought fucking meticulous bullshit in there when they're tapping their toes.
1021880	1026600	People just write these songs. They're like, they change tenses. They change like from first
1026600	1031160	person to third person. I don't know who he is and who you are. Someone's stealing someone's girl.
1031160	1035400	Who the fuck is, who are we? I mean, I'm, I'm, again, like, no one cares. I might make it in
1035400	1039880	this wrong, but I love the movie by the Who Quadra-Fenia and it's a great rainy day, depressing
1039880	1045480	movie. And, uh, it's, uh, all the soundtrack of course is by the Who and Sting is in it when he,
1045480	1049640	when he was young and not a complete twat. And, uh, he was just great. He's in a silver suit and
1049640	1053880	he was great. And, uh, but they, they, they thought Quadra-Fenia meant like, what if you had
1053880	1061480	four personalities? They thought schizophrenia meant two. They're like, okay, yeah, we kind of,
1061480	1064840	we kind of, I thought it was just a reference. I never saw that movie and I was just assumed it was
1064920	1069400	some kind of, like, product placement for the new speaker system or something. Quadra-Fenix.
1069400	1073880	Well, I think, I think that was the riff they're trying to do. I don't know. Rock and roll music,
1074600	1078680	lyrics shouldn't be looked at too closely. Yeah. Writers, writers and musicians. Why can't they
1078680	1082920	get along? You know, they do in like, uh, Christina Aguilera songs or something. Because those,
1082920	1087400	like people that aren't singer songwriters, they, they have like a nice 45 year old man sit down
1087480	1094280	and write a little, a little ditty. Hand it off to a, a young sexy urchin whose, whose, whose voice
1094280	1099160	is good for two years. And then they go, and I'm a genie in a battle. Rubbing all the metaphors
1099160	1105240	all work. Oh, you rub me the right way. I'm a genie and make a wish. I wish the genie was happening.
1105240	1109560	Oh, this is great. It's like, it's like, it's like William Goldman wrote this. He did, he did.
1110920	1116440	An old guy in a log cabin wrote that. He had, he had, he had A cups. Like, he's like, he's,
1116440	1118840	he's not someone that you want to rub the right way. Well, guess what?
1120440	1126120	Beauty's only skin deep. We need to work together. Ugly people are smarter than you.
1127560	1132600	Have we talked about in the show a piano man, uh, the regular crowd shuffles in the man in the bar
1132600	1138600	sitting next to me making love to his tonic and gin. No, gross. No, you don't get to change the
1138600	1142200	name of the drink to suit your purposes. Oh, I thought you meant it was gross because it sounds
1142200	1148040	like you're coming in his drink. Making love to his tonic and gin. And there's Gary over there
1148040	1156120	with his dick in the jar. You can see the strands floating to the top. And he swizzles his drink
1156120	1166040	with his balls and his stink in it. Janitor's getting them up. We're, we're getting, we're
1166120	1173320	getting played off by the ghost of, of Jebediah nerd melt. Get out of here. Your show doesn't
1173320	1179800	have a script. It's terrible. Great Baron did that joke 20 years ago. You've, you've conditioned
1179800	1186280	these people via systemic deprivation to applaud rhyming mop with whatever you rhymed it with.
1188040	1192760	Other people have acts. Tonic and gin. Making love to his jelly and peanut butter. That's fucking,
1193480	1199160	that's just lazy bullshit. Yeah. Also the gambler, but I like Kenny Rogers a lot.
1199720	1204120	I love Kenny Rogers. I met him when I was nine and Acapulco. So I love the guy.
1206120	1211960	In the gambler, he rhymes sleep and keep twice. I think that's, I think that's lazy
1211960	1216920	bullshit. You don't, you don't do the same rhyme. Well, how about he did the same song four times.
1216920	1223720	Do, do, do the, everybody saw the farmer with the magic peanut.
1225720	1229400	Wait, how does that again work? The fucking, they're all just like,
1231160	1234600	I don't know the musical terms, but I know the fucking guy just sits down and writes a fucking,
1235320	1240040	you know, writes, uh, uh, the charge of the light brigade. The fucking like puts it to like,
1242680	1246600	it's always about a guy. It's just like, can you see me? I don't know. I don't know.
1246600	1252200	Your knowledge of, of the battle of balaclava or Alfred Lord Tennyson, Lloyd Tennyson. Would,
1252200	1256920	would you, would you please do me a country version of the charge of the light brigade?
1257880	1261400	Cannons to the left of them. Cannons all around them.
1263160	1267480	But the man with one leg came to town and said that he had found them
1268200	1274040	on a misty rivers country night. This character broke even.
1275640	1280200	And that's the story of Kenny Rogers of a guy named fucking Steven thing.
1281320	1285240	It's always a guy. All right. I'm thinking of two sides. Cower to the county in the gambling.
1285240	1287480	Cower to the county is a good one. But you know, he fucking, you know,
1287480	1290680	if we brought up a Kenny Rogers album, you'd see a bunch of failed attempts.
1290680	1293960	You know, he started off in a psychedelic like hit me back called first edition.
1294680	1299240	First or second edition? First edition. First edition. I did like, I just dropped in to see
1299240	1302200	what condition my condition is. And that's him. And when he left that band, they're like,
1302200	1304120	you're never going to make it, baby. Like he said, no, I'm going to make country
1304120	1307800	music. Like you'll never make it. And he went off and wrote some of the biggest hits.
1307800	1310600	You know, he's a Scientologist. Is he a psych guy?
1313720	1314360	You never know.
1316760	1320120	Who would have thought back, you know, who would have thought Will Smith?
1320120	1326520	Look, if I said Kenny Rogers was a Scientologist, I would give Scientology a second glance.
1327080	1331320	Well, I don't want to bring this up again, but you should read that book going clear.
1333240	1339800	You come away from it with a respect for, you don't dehumanize people that are just
1339800	1342360	because they're Scientologists anymore after reading that book.
1342360	1345800	I wouldn't either. If I ever met a Scientologist who would sit down and explain what it is that
1345800	1350760	they do, but it's so goddamn private. Well, then read this book going clear.
1350760	1356200	It's like 700 pages. I can't talk to a person that's a, I don't know. Maybe you can.
1356200	1359480	Well, yeah, you can. There's independent Scientologists. It's also the guy Marty
1359480	1363160	Rathbun. We just watched a documentary about him. There's a lot of people that, you know,
1363160	1366840	raised on this, on this religion. How much were ridiculous? Is anything, you know,
1366840	1370600	we've had Mormons on stage talking to us about Mormonism. We've had, we've had,
1370600	1376920	I think we had a Jew once. Speaking of which, I'm assuming he's Jewish because of his last name.
1376920	1383560	Adam Goldberg has a special surprise for us. That's pretty anti-Semitic, you guys.
1385000	1392920	He's a human being. Oh, you, oh, you hate him the person. Oh, I'm sorry. I connected those dots wrong.
1393400	1402120	No, Adam Goldberg, he, he went on to Reddit and he, do you believe that? I, I'm going to suspend
1402120	1409240	my disbelief. He, he, he culled together through rigorous research and, and conversation with
1409960	1417560	Harmontown fans in honor of our hundredth, our cent, centiposodial spectacular.
1418360	1421560	He has an 18 question trivia quiz.
1425720	1426440	It gets better.
1428680	1435000	All right. We were thinking that you and I would go up against a Harmontown superfan from the
1435080	1442360	audience and see, see if one of you could get more answers right about our show than Dan and I.
1442360	1445720	Is that right? Yeah. I mean, given the fact that we're always in a blackout drunk.
1446920	1451640	They're going to win. I already know the results. Yeah. So should we have them elect one of their
1451640	1455640	own to, to be that representative? Yeah. Well, I don't know how they'll do that. I mean, that could,
1455640	1459480	well, let's, let's, let's, let's set them against themselves. Who here thinks that they would
1459480	1465880	probably be the best at answering Harmontown trivia? Over here. We have a few hands up.
1468600	1470840	Anatoly may have it. He's so hard to understand. Yeah.
1474600	1482760	What does fuck y'all mean? All right. Huh? Who do we got? We got two, two hands. What's your name
1482760	1488040	right there? MC. MC. Yeah. You think, you think you got the goods? I can try. MC, bring it up here.
1488040	1491240	I fuck it. I, I, I like, I like the look of this guy. We're going to give him a chance here.
1499320	1505240	Oh, it's good. This. The boys wants the girls while the girls wants the boys. Yeah. We'll try to,
1507000	1510840	we'll try to, we'll try to lightning through this. Where's, where's, where's gold bug?
1510840	1513400	Goldberg, are you here? Adam Goldberg, everybody.
1518280	1525400	Hi, MC. MC, what is your curriculum vitae? What are your credentials that you think that
1525400	1531880	qualifies you to beat Dan and I at our own game here? Well, I recently binge listened to the whole
1531880	1537000	show. Okay. You already got us. You already got us all a hundred episodes, all 99 episodes. How
1537000	1542760	long did it take you to get through all a hundred? Well, I, I started listening when I started a new
1542760	1548600	job and that job was about like two months. And with the exception of like, like breaking to watch
1548600	1552920	whatever was like new on like Lulu or whatever, it would be like the only source of entertainment.
1553800	1558280	And I caught up. Oh God. He's gotta hate me more than the rest of you combined.
1559480	1563480	Yeah. Have you been to the live show before? Oh yeah. Yeah, totally. Totally. Yeah. I think
1563640	1567000	I've seen you here before. Basically, once I caught up, that's when I started attending.
1567000	1570840	Okay. So how many times have you been here life? Uh, I think this would be like my fifth or sixth.
1570840	1575720	Fifth or sixth. Yeah. Uh, could you describe the nature of that job without getting in trouble?
1575720	1580920	Yeah, it was an animator or sorry, a storyboard artist on a show called a Bojack Horseman.
1582200	1587000	It's going to be on Netflix. It's genuinely good. And that was the only thing keeping me from like,
1587000	1591880	Dan, what do you think the pitch, the log line is for Bojack Horseman, Bojack Horseman.
1592760	1596760	The, the, the, how the West was one on the side.
1599080	1602600	Like it's got to have some kind of, right? Like Misfit Cowboys.
1602600	1606760	Uh, it's actually got Alison Brie from, from community on it. Fuck the show.
1608920	1612760	So like, like there's no actors looking for work, right? Give Alison Brie another job.
1614840	1617800	Uh, no, what is it? What's the, can you give us the like, kind of,
1617800	1625160	conceit of it? It's, it's about like a, uh, um, uh, out of work actor who's like trying to like
1625160	1633080	cope with his like self loathing and depression. Um, but like he's a horse. He's, he's, he's a
1633080	1640600	horse. Oh, he's like a horse man. Yeah. He's a horse man. Is he, is he a centaur? Uh, uh,
1640600	1644040	he's like a reverse centaur. He's like horse from the neck top. Oh yeah.
1645000	1650760	Oh, he's a, he's a or a centaur. Is it, is it live action or animated? It's animated.
1651960	1657720	Well, he says a storyboard artist, it could be live action. They would have to plan the horse,
1657720	1662360	horse composites, you know. Also it's cast entirely by people that you don't know for
1662360	1667080	being in cartoons. You know what I mean? Like it's a, like Amy Sedaris is in it and, uh, freaking,
1667160	1676760	uh, uh, from Breaking Bad. What's his name? Uh, Jesse. Yeah. All right. Well, sounds good.
1676760	1680440	All right. Let's, let's, let's kick this out. So, uh, Adam Goldberg, uh, tell us what the rules
1680440	1684600	are with what we're doing here. Well, there are three answers to every question. One of them,
1684600	1689720	or two of them is correct. One of them is correct. I want to say that I had a story about the Sims,
1689720	1695400	actually. Adam, what are the rules to the game that we're about to play? My brother went out.
1695400	1701560	What are the rules? You are here for one task, Adam. It's our hundredth fucking show, Adam. We're
1701560	1708200	not going to do this. I will shout you down. I would play the game. He can't, he's actually
1708200	1713080	going to make me line producer of yours thing. Um, okay. So I'm going to ask questions. I thought
1713080	1718040	he was going to wax rhapsodic about Sims for a while. Yeah. The only story is my brother's
1718040	1725240	married. My family. You're compulsive for money. You know, I normally don't get to give my
1725240	1728920	two cents because I'm usually just listening to it, but I'm pro Goldberg. I'm cool with hearing
1728920	1738280	the story. Don't suck up to the judges. I always go back and forth because the minute someone says
1738280	1745800	I'm pro Goldberg and 150 people boo and, and he doesn't pull out a rifle or, or run from the
1745800	1749160	station. Then I, then I become pro Goldberg. Cause I'm like, what the fuck is this?
1749160	1758760	You just say you're pro Goldberg. And then look at his face. I'm anti Goldberg.
1762280	1766840	Thank you. We've, I mean, we've discussed this forever. Harmon towns for misfits and,
1766840	1774040	and uh, he's the, I mean, he's, he's, he's, he's Claudius. Are we going to go start a colony on
1774040	1777640	the moon for misfits? And we're just going to start as soon as we get, as soon as we get off
1777640	1782920	the spaceship, we're going to go. All right. Where's the nerd? Get out of here. I need a space
1782920	1788440	suit. Get out of here. Yeah. There's 99 spacesuits. All right. Adam, tell us the rules. If you would,
1788440	1794360	please, I'm going to ask the question either of team Dan Jeff or team guy who worked on the centaur
1794360	1803720	show. MC MC. That's easy to remember. And, uh, apparently not. I don't like stockups immediately
1803720	1811800	changes my opinion. I'm back with these guys. Come on. You just go where the wind blows back.
1812600	1818680	And if, um, you just don't know the other team can steal and just, if you're like, uh,
1818680	1824040	but it's multiple choice. So that's unlikely. All right. Who wants it first? Uh, team Dan or team
1824040	1830440	MC. Um, I'll take it. All right. MC MC. If I get it wrong, like do I get knocked out and someone
1830440	1835000	else has to like, we need to round around and stuff like that or no. Okay. How does the scoring
1835000	1838840	work? Most out of 18 questions, most out of 18. All right. Let's fire through these. All right.
1840920	1845800	Okay. Real Abed proposed a restaurant where everything is really small. What was it called
1845800	1853160	a real Abed's real food for real people? B bites or C mini mine? B bites. That is correct. One point.
1853320	1860680	MC. I knew that. I knew that. I almost feel you could have eliminated the multiple choice out of
1860680	1865080	that and had us try to freestyle, but let's see what goes. If he gets into lead, he'll have to freestyle.
1865800	1871000	This is a challenge. Okay. All right. Yeah. He's already in lead. So that doesn't apply. MC has jumped
1871000	1877320	out to commanding one zero lead. All right. Okay. Give each person that you ask, give them the option
1877320	1881960	of, uh, of, uh, they get, if they can, if they can get it without getting the multiple choices.
1881960	1887320	That's two points. Two points. All right. There we go. All right. Okay. Uh, which is not a fiction. I
1887320	1893320	can't do that for this. This is, which is not. Okay. Which, uh, how many episodes did Dan wear
1893320	1902600	the eye Harman? Do you want the multiple choice? It's my, uh, uh, uh, yes, I want the multiple
1902600	1913400	choice. Okay. A is two to three. B is four to five. And C is exactly six. B four to, no, no, no, no,
1913400	1917400	no, no, no. A, A, uh, two to three. That is correct. One point for Dean Dan. All right.
1920200	1927320	I wrote it down. That's why I knew. Two against one. Because he's listened to them all. I never
1927320	1932360	listened to any of them. Oh, I wasn't using Jeff. You're saying I'm cheating by using
1932760	1936920	Jeff. No, she's saying that we have two, two heads are better than one theory. But believe me,
1936920	1941640	he just listened to them all recently. So he has access to this more recent information in his head.
1941640	1946840	Also, I wasn't thinking that Jeff and I were like both. Thanks. Thanks. I was going to say sweetie,
1946840	1955640	but it's 2014. I might see a blog entry tomorrow. Dan Harman called me sweetie. The story of
1955640	1965160	humanity versus the asshole. MC, which is not a fictional Harman town character?
1965160	1970760	A death row inmate O'Malley B Jerry McSeinfeld or C Koomale 2.0.
1975480	1979800	I'm going to, I'm going to go with a death row inmate or rally. That is incorrect.
1980280	1989880	Oh, we're all tied up at one, one. All right. In the episode, everyone's a rapper. Comedian
1989880	1994120	Misha complains that everyone in his family calls him the same name. What is it?
1997160	2003240	Give me multiples. A, snap the Jeff. B, Misha Kwon or C, Jackie Chan.
2003240	2010760	I'll, I'll, everyone in his family, everyone in his family gets called the same name. Oh,
2010760	2013960	I'll try C. C is correct. Jackie Chan.
2016760	2021320	I'm on the team with you, Dan. I'm laying low. Oh, okay. I'm laying low because I have no idea
2021320	2028440	what's going on. Right. MC, what ill tempered skeleton, uh, did the gang piss off to start
2028440	2036760	the trial of Tormont tour? I'm going to need the choices. A, Linnev B Lannister and C Fornheim.
2036760	2038200	Linnev. That is correct.
2042600	2044520	I hope it's no one's first time here tonight. Yeah.
2048360	2050200	We'll have him come up and give a review afterwards.
2050760	2055560	As kind of a fun show, I guess, uh, I'm going to go play Peanutle with my uncle now.
2059320	2064280	Nine. It's called Peanutle. Oh, go ahead. How many times has Jeff said,
2065320	2069480	how many times has Jeff said that should be the title of the episode or some variant?
2072120	2078840	I'll take multiple choices. A, 12 times. B, 15 times. Or C, there's no way I would look that up.
2080920	2087640	Well, knowing you, you looked it up. Um, 12 times. Nope. I didn't look it up.
2087800	2092440	He's fine. I mean, looking it up would entail hundreds and hundreds of hours.
2093320	2096440	I would have been curious how many times he said versus how many times it was
2097080	2099960	because there were some times where I was like, yeah, it should. Oh, it's not though. It's
2099960	2102920	something else completely. All right. That's some homework for you guys to do.
2104520	2108440	Now there's one of MC's tires is going to be flat and there's going to be a note that says like,
2108440	2117240	why don't you run the game? And then you, then you will not be pro Goldberg.
2117640	2122360	Yeah. The one person on the side. All right. All right. MC. Yes, sir. Which episode manages
2122360	2128120	the earliest episode naming coming in less than 72 seconds into the episode. A, push the
2128120	2137080	button, pull the chain. B, dudes and goo. Or C, Felicity whack-a-mole. Uh, this is for us,
2137080	2141960	right? That's very MC. Oh, MC. Okay. I'm gonna fail this one. I think I know this one. I'm gonna,
2142040	2147080	I'm gonna say, Hey, that is correct. I was wrong.
2150200	2155880	Daniel Shoney's loving audience member, big red went to this college. Do you want,
2155880	2159720	can you guess or multiple? Wait, hang on. We're a team, right? Yeah.
2159720	2163560	Yeah. You can chime in if you know, he and I are together, right? Yes. Um,
2167320	2168840	I'm not going to guess, but I want to hear the multiple.
2169640	2173640	I think I might know it, but I'm, I'm not confident about it.
2174760	2182360	A Azusa Pacific, B LA city college, or C UCLA. I was wrong again. I think, I think it's,
2182360	2186440	I think it's Azusa because I was going to say something kind of along those lines,
2186440	2190840	like, like, I think it was, I think that, that, that ring a bell, like why would words like
2190840	2194600	Azusa Pacific ring a bell? I go with that one. All right. That is also correct.
2195240	2201320	The first thing I thought came to mind was San Luis Obispo. And then Azusa Pacific seemed like,
2201320	2205320	yeah, he was from San Luis Obispo. Oh, is he really? I don't care. Fucking genius.
2207480	2211960	MC name three sentient beings that Quark has had sex with.
2214040	2215000	Name three. He hasn't.
2217560	2220280	That is actually a harder question. We'll prove that to the bonus round.
2224600	2227480	I feel like I could, but go, go ahead and give me the multiple choice.
2227480	2229800	The name three things. I have a list of four things.
2230440	2238120	Oh shit. Okay. So I can't write. All right. All right. Uh, a horse. Yep. Uh, giant spider. Yup.
2238680	2244360	Squirrel. Did you have sex with a squirrel? Jeff? I don't, did I? Yeah, that's it.
2247400	2252600	He summoned a squirrel to have sex with it. I also would have accepted Sharpie butts a lot. Right.
2252600	2259080	And Quark and Robobrefie. Hey there, lonely squirrel.
2262120	2266280	Spencer once appeared on community as Annie Edison's brother. What was his first name, Dan?
2267320	2273160	Isn't that a trick question? Didn't it, uh, didn't it get changed? Uh, there was a trick you
2273960	2281320	going with the cannon of the show. In other words, what his name was on screen. Uh, god damn it.
2283080	2288120	Oh, I know what it was. It was the opposite because I wanted it to be, uh, Andy originally
2288120	2292920	because as if their parents had named them, uh, after Raggedy Ann and Andy, but that didn't
2292920	2299720	legally clear. So his name was Anthony. All right. That's correct. I would have also accepted
2299720	2305080	Spence word. So you would have accepted what? Spence word. Spence word. I thought this was
2305080	2313960	questions. All right. Okay. Before breaking out, this is MC before breaking out in back brace
2313960	2319240	dynasty. Adam was a production manager on a terrible shark movie. What movie was it? Is it
2319240	2326200	us? No, it's MC. Oh shit. I know this one. Uh, uh, give me the choices. Okay. Avalanche sharks.
2326920	2330120	Shark Kano and shark Island to shark bite.
2331080	2337000	No, but I made that one up. Oh, all right. It's getting close. What's the score? Oh, I can steal
2337000	2346760	it. I know it. You can steal it. Avalanche sharks, right? No. Okay. Okay. Next question.
2346760	2353400	It wasn't shark NATO or whatever that was. It wasn't sharks. It was avalanche sharks,
2353400	2356200	which turned into avalanche shark once they didn't have enough shark puppets.
2356680	2362840	Two people got carbon monoxide poisoning because they got really, really low quality trailers.
2362840	2370040	All right. Next question. Uh, no. Cause the audience shouted out. Audience got a point.
2370040	2376360	You guys are now in it. Okay. Audience, you're now in third. All right. In the episode frequently,
2376360	2380920	I am a woman in my dreams who admits to frequently being a woman in their dreams.
2380920	2387640	That's, is that MC's or yours? Oh, okay. Me. Yeah. That's correct.
2389800	2398200	I would have also accepted Aaron. I bet you would. Oh, is that insulting? I don't. All right.
2399960	2405640	All right. MC for two points, two of Dan's foot fetishes. Uh, I'm going to name one of Dan's foot
2405640	2409320	fetishes. You can name the other two for two points or I'll give you one more and you can
2409320	2416040	get it for one point. The first one is dangling. Right. There are two more that start with that
2416040	2432040	letter. Heel popping. Yep. Dipping. Yep. We have the worst podcast in the world.
2432040	2438280	All right. But the best listeners, certainly the best.
2440040	2444920	In the new hamburger, Tim Heidecker segment, dead or alive, how did Hosni Mubarak die?
2445720	2450200	What the fuck are you talking about? In episode 108 and the new hamburger,
2450200	2460600	Tim Heidecker segment, how did Hosni Mubarak die? It's, I mean, you get the correct answers.
2460600	2467000	He died choking on a rod. He ate in some stew in an art gallery. He choked on a rod.
2467000	2470280	That was a Hermitown episode? Oh, no, that's comedy. Bang, bang. I thought you guys.
2470280	2474600	What the fuck are you doing? They haven't had me on yet. I need to suck up.
2474600	2477640	No, that one is stricken from the record. Okay. Doesn't count.
2478680	2483160	Next, the final question. Okay. Thank God. And then the final one will be a top up,
2483160	2490120	top up, convertible. How can chicken noodle man of the eponymous song make his troubles go away?
2490120	2494840	Who's this for, by the way? This is for Jeff. All right. I know it's not.
2494840	2498920	I guarantee you, I know the chicken noodle man question. I helped write the month.
2498920	2503560	Is it MC's turn or Jeff's turn? Are you sure? I'll give it to MC because I feel Jeff knows it.
2503560	2506600	One more time to ask a question. How can chicken noodle man
2506600	2509640	of the eponymous song make his troubles go away?
2512760	2515240	So easy. Feed the devil soup.
2515240	2517640	That is correct. He feeds the devil soup from his penis.
2517640	2522120	All right. That was a lob.
2522120	2528200	He's pretty much tied up. The audience has fallen behind, but this is awesome.
2528200	2531160	You're going to have to buzz in for this one because it is the tiebreaker.
2532440	2536120	MC is winning, but this one could break the tie in favor of team Dan Jeff.
2536120	2538360	All right. Duncan Trussell.
2538360	2540760	We buzz in. What do we do? Say buzz?
2540760	2546600	Yeah. Duncan Trussell, who played Christoper twice, once chopped off Christoper's ding dong.
2546600	2549880	He also carved something into Chris's arm. What was it?
2551560	2551800	Yep.
2555000	2556360	A pentagram.
2556360	2561160	Nope. All right. MC, if you get this one, you've got the game. If not, I'm out of questions.
2561160	2566680	Shit, man. It was about something Camille said on his own show about a game,
2566680	2568440	and I cannot remember what game it was.
2568440	2572520	He said, how can you have a gaming podcast and not talk about Starcraft 2?
2572520	2574440	I'm going to get count for MC in the audience.
2574440	2574840	MC!
2575560	2576760	All right. MC wins.
2580600	2581160	Thank you, sir.
2585800	2589560	Thank you, Adam. Thank you, Adam Goldberg, everybody.
2591720	2595400	That was a lot of hard work for both Adam and all of us, right?
2596840	2599000	We all deserve a round of applause.
2599000	2601160	No, but thank you for putting in the research, Adam.
2601880	2606760	Without that segment, we really would not have had a 100th episode special at all.
2607320	2607720	You know?
2608280	2611400	It felt like something you would do in a 100th episode special.
2611400	2611560	Yeah.
2612520	2615400	Otherwise, it'd just be me talking about what? Crime shows?
2616280	2618760	What am I? The what am I guy?
2620760	2621400	Andy Kindler?
2622280	2626920	If you went to another planet and you had to cheat, there was only one of the three possibilities
2626920	2630600	available to you that women could do or you could watch on porn.
2632120	2634120	Heel poppin', dippin' or danglin'?
2635480	2636360	You had to pick one.
2636360	2637320	What's the one?
2637320	2639800	What is my favorite out of heel poppin', dippin' or danglin'?
2639800	2643960	What's your desert island heel fetish thing?
2645320	2647640	Well, you get danglin' out of there right away.
2651640	2653400	Because there's no activity to that.
2653400	2654120	I mean, that's it.
2654120	2656520	Like, dangling is what follows a heel pop.
2657800	2660040	It's just built into the heel pop.
2660040	2662680	And heel poppin' is built into a dipping.
2662680	2663560	What's dipping again?
2663560	2665480	Well, dipping could be like a lot of things.
2665480	2669000	It could be like a woman like...
2670520	2672120	Well, no, no, no. That's just heel poppin'.
2672120	2672360	Okay.
2673240	2678280	Well, dipping is like the shoe is on the floor and the foot is going in and out.
2679160	2679640	Dippin'.
2680120	2684920	Yeah, like the woman is lost in thought.
2684920	2688200	She's just casually dipping her foot in and out of her shoe.
2688200	2691160	I'm presuming that not a foot fetishist or a heel fetishist,
2691160	2693720	but I'm presuming that you'd want a little bit of all of those.
2693720	2694360	You want a little...
2694360	2695240	Yeah, I think that's why they all come together.
2695240	2696120	You want a couple dips?
2696120	2697800	It's like eyes, ears, nose, and throat.
2697800	2699160	Like, you don't bother to...
2700200	2702360	Again, you have to pick one.
2702360	2705800	Well, tell that to an eyes, ears, nose, and throat guy.
2705800	2707400	It's like, oh, I'm an optometrist.
2707400	2708520	I mean, who needs those?
2709800	2710200	All right.
2711960	2712600	What about that?
2712600	2713560	I mean, what is that?
2714200	2716040	What do you go to an eyes, ears, nose, and throat guy?
2716040	2716760	Are you dodging the question?
2716760	2718200	There's such a thing as an optometrist.
2718200	2719400	It's like, just an eye guy.
2728040	2734200	I'm trying to picture all three separate somehow and give you an actual sincere answer.
2734200	2734680	I guess...
2739000	2739800	I guess dippin'.
2741640	2742600	All right, dippin'.
2744920	2747160	On our 200th episode, that would be a trivia question.
2750600	2754760	All right, let's bring out my fiancé, Eric McGathey.
2764200	2771960	Hello.
2771960	2772920	Hi, Scoops.
2772920	2773560	Hi.
2773560	2774040	Scoops?
2775800	2776920	It's a dippin' reference.
2780920	2783160	Scoops Johnson was the evil canevil of dippin'.
2788040	2791400	Anything you want to address or anything?
2792360	2797080	Well, I was trying to think of my own fetishes.
2801160	2802440	I guess not.
2802440	2802920	I don't know.
2803800	2804280	No?
2804280	2805080	I'm doing great.
2805080	2806040	Do you have any fetishes?
2807080	2808040	I like smoking.
2809400	2812200	I know it's really bad for people that I do think.
2812200	2813400	That's just called an addiction.
2813400	2813960	That's not like a...
2813960	2814440	Yeah.
2815080	2816040	But if we're talking about...
2816040	2818280	You mean you look at how guys look when they smoke?
2819240	2819880	Um, yeah.
2819880	2823640	Not people I know, because the only person I know who smokes is Dustin Marshall.
2823640	2825720	And I imagine him back there being like,
2825720	2826280	Oh, no.
2826280	2826760	Oh, no.
2828760	2829400	No, I like...
2830840	2834040	I, like, like, fetishes outside of...
2834040	2834920	I mean, that's...
2834920	2840360	I missed the first part of that, the exchange that you just had about the dippin' and the...
2840360	2846040	Jeff asked you what your favorite pornographic foot thing was, right?
2846280	2846920	Out of...
2846920	2847560	Because there's this...
2848920	2849320	Dipping...
2849960	2851000	What is it?
2851000	2852600	Dipping, dangling, heel popping.
2852600	2853800	It's kind of like I'm saying.
2853800	2854680	Like, it's usually...
2857800	2861080	That's a more specific, long-winded way of saying shoe play.
2861640	2863800	Shoe play is part of...
2863800	2867080	Is under the branch of foot fetish, which is...
2867080	2867560	I don't know.
2867560	2868680	Like, then there's...
2868680	2869560	That's a big tree.
2869560	2871800	I mean, the real tragedy of this...
2871800	2874680	And if you guys have been to the show while I've ever seen pictures,
2875240	2877080	I usually wear these boots and these tights.
2877080	2878360	It's because I don't have feet.
2880280	2882840	And backstage listening to this...
2883720	2884200	It's actually...
2884200	2888040	That's the best reaction to it, ever.
2888040	2889960	When I acquired my foot fetish is when we...
2889960	2892360	Yeah, when we became intimate and I realized you had no feet.
2892360	2892760	It was like...
2894440	2895880	All right, I pine for feet now.
2897080	2898120	She can't help it.
2898120	2898760	I don't...
2898760	2900600	I mean, I have one fetish.
2901320	2902920	First name, last name, Dan Harmon.
2903320	2904840	All my sexuality is wrapped up in...
2906920	2908280	Men and women, I think, work differently.
2908280	2909000	I don't have...
2909000	2912040	I think the foot fetishism is a very male thing.
2912040	2912680	Do women...
2912680	2914600	Are there a lot of women foot fetishes?
2914600	2915320	So there are gals out...
2915320	2916680	Ladies?
2916680	2917640	Would anybody admit to it?
2917640	2918680	Any gals?
2918680	2920920	It seems that women wouldn't have a foot fetish.
2920920	2922520	Because guys' feet are like, wow.
2922520	2923720	Or a foot fetish.
2923720	2928680	Once we go down this road, we're going to run into this millennial LA...
2928680	2930040	I have a listening fetish.
2932920	2935000	I have a...
2935000	2936040	I'm sorry, what's that?
2936040	2936840	I have a...
2936840	2938360	I have a compassion fetish.
2939720	2942200	I have a thoughtfulness fetish.
2943400	2944120	So why me?
2945880	2946680	Well, because it's...
2946680	2948520	You know, because it's weird, you know?
2950280	2950920	That's what makes it that better.
2950920	2952520	The same way that she has no feet.
2952520	2953080	Yeah.
2953080	2953400	All right.
2954200	2956760	No, but I do like smoking.
2956760	2958920	I did once sleep with a man,
2958920	2960440	just because he looked like David Bowie,
2960440	2963160	and I requested that he smoked while he had sex with me.
2963160	2967080	And then I felt very ashamed because I did very much use him for that.
2967080	2970040	And because he sustained a lot of burns that are on his face, right?
2971160	2973400	No, no, he was smoking.
2973400	2974280	He was smoking.
2974280	2974920	But I mean...
2974920	2977000	He had to smoke a cigarette while having sex with him?
2977000	2980520	I made him put on...
2981080	2983400	I'm going to regret this immediately.
2983400	2986440	But I asked that he...
2987640	2989160	He didn't know that I was going out with him
2989160	2990600	just because he looked like David Bowie.
2990600	2992280	And we got back to his...
2992280	2993320	Which era of David Bowie?
2995480	2996840	Modern love David Bowie.
2997480	3000920	And I asked him to put on a David Bowie record.
3000920	3003320	He had hunky dory put on the record.
3003960	3006440	And then he had cigarettes because he was a smoker.
3006440	3008840	And I said, you probably have to smoke right now, right?
3008840	3010200	He was like, what? No, no.
3010200	3010840	He was very dumb.
3010840	3011640	He was very, very dumb.
3013400	3014840	It's not a proud moment.
3014840	3017880	But I asked if he could smoke a cigarette while...
3018600	3019880	Making love to me.
3020520	3022360	And holding a glass ball on the other hand.
3024440	3027000	And asking you or telling you that you remind him of the babe.
3028760	3030200	What babe? What babe?
3031000	3031560	Sarah.
3034120	3034920	Oh my god.
3034920	3037400	100th anniversary episode guest.
3037400	3038280	David Bowie's here.
3040840	3041240	Aaron.
3042440	3042920	Aaron.
3045000	3047800	I'm here because you asked me to be Aaron.
3047880	3049880	Aaron.
3049880	3053880	Jareth, I set my fiancé here.
3053880	3055000	When David Bowie comes out...
3055000	3055560	Shut up!
3058040	3059080	His name is David.
3061080	3067720	I'd like to make love to you while smoking and eating a cake.
3069240	3069560	No, no, no, no, no.
3069560	3073080	I'll offer you bites of crumbs and sauces.
3074040	3075320	I'm a musician.
3075320	3077160	I don't have to write well.
3078600	3083640	Oh, Dan, Dan, you have not returned your books on time.
3084760	3087000	Are you calling David Bowie Dan now?
3087000	3087720	I'm confused.
3087720	3088520	No.
3088520	3089960	She's countering with...
3089960	3090440	Oh, I see.
3090440	3092040	You have not returned your books on time.
3092840	3095960	These stockings make my shoes slide off.
3099080	3099560	So embarrassing.
3099560	3101160	Make my shoes slide off.
3103560	3104040	Oh yeah.
3104440	3106920	Can I hit pause on this?
3108280	3112520	That's like the equivalent of just in a regular porn, an actor saying like,
3112520	3115000	God, my vagina is so penis shaped.
3116840	3118280	It's like an inverted penis.
3118280	3120200	Like one would just fit in like a...
3120200	3122200	I mean, Dan, I've never seen any of these.
3122200	3123560	I've never seen any of these videos.
3123560	3126360	Can we just attempt the talking version of this?
3127160	3128440	I don't watch it for the talking.
3128520	3132840	Is there in your shoe play video, in your average,
3132840	3137560	like just this run of the mill work a day shoe play film or scene?
3137560	3138520	I mean, there's no such thing.
3140600	3142360	Oh, Crippendorf's tribe.
3142360	3143240	Crippendorf's tribe.
3143240	3146200	No, there's no run of the mill.
3146200	3147000	The Casablanca.
3148440	3151560	You were telling me once about a pantyhose video and you said,
3152600	3154680	we both knew that they were called challenges.
3155640	3156280	Yeah.
3156280	3156600	Okay.
3156600	3160680	You were cleaning out my shit and you found a VHS tape and it said
3160680	3162920	like summer's pantyhose challenge.
3162920	3164040	Yeah, I found one.
3164040	3165080	I found one.
3165080	3165560	All right.
3168600	3170920	I found one with many other friends.
3170920	3173560	There was, you know, Christina's pantyhose challenge.
3173560	3178360	But you were like, look, I knew when I was cleaning up stuff, I'd find stuff.
3179080	3183080	I'm not here to judge you, make you feel awkward in front of 200 people or anything like that.
3183080	3184040	Like you said all that.
3185080	3189480	But for my own edification, because there's no such thing as a VCR anymore,
3189480	3192280	could you please tell me what it, what does that mean?
3193320	3194760	What is the challenge?
3194760	3201320	And I said, I think it just means how many pair can she put on in one video?
3201320	3204520	And then you started laughing and it was like, yeah, it is ridiculous.
3204520	3205400	The idea that it's a challenge.
3205400	3210120	But then I found out like 45 minutes later that the whole time you thought that meant
3210120	3211160	all over each other.
3211240	3214440	Like she that she was just like had these giant legs.
3215880	3217160	Number 58.
3219880	3221160	She was on That's Incredible.
3223160	3227000	I had continued cleaning and I came back in and I was like, I could do that.
3227000	3227960	I mean, how many?
3227960	3229240	I was like, what was the most?
3231960	3233160	You saw the word challenge.
3233160	3235160	That's your fetish is competitive.
3235160	3236440	There's you're like, challenge, challenge.
3236440	3237080	I'll win that.
3237080	3245320	I mean, it depends on what you're talking about.
3245320	3247720	Like I've been I'm 41 years old.
3247720	3249080	I predate the internet.
3249080	3254200	There's I have I have seen there's there's there's there's candid stuff where it's like
3254200	3259880	actual creepy like like I'm on a train and here's like there's a woman seat ahead of me
3259880	3262360	and she was she was heel popping dipping or whatever.
3262360	3264760	You there's people that have websites or there's videos like that.
3264760	3267080	Then there's people like their shoes or hate them.
3267720	3271400	What mean in the video?
3271400	3272360	There's no narrative.
3272360	3274920	There's no Bruce Banner of deal popping.
3274920	3278520	That's like, if only I could find out how to get these shoes off or the shoes.
3279560	3283880	I think the whole thing comes from like a probably it's probably the root of the tree
3283880	3285800	that has to do with leg and foot fetishry.
3285800	3289480	I don't want to offend anybody who who who shares this stuff.
3289480	3294200	But but I would I would hazard a guess that there's there's a there's a root among that
3294200	3297880	tree. There's a trunk of that tree that has a little bit to do with self loathing and
3299080	3305240	you know more voyeurism and less intimacy just to like like like like maybe little kids playing
3305240	3309640	under the table with their matchbooks cars when it that were raised in the 70s and 80s
3310920	3318280	whose first sexual thought happened at the same time as like you know just looking at a woman's
3318760	3326120	uh uh fully clothed legs as opposed to like I don't know if there's women out there like wishing
3326120	3330680	there were more videos of men like that crock dippin you know or like like like I mean this is
3330680	3336360	right for this for this audience as as soon as you were to say anything gender specific
3336360	3340040	somebody's some there's somebody that's going to be the exception there's always and it's like
3340040	3346680	we're trying to learn not to draw these gigantic circles but the conventional wisdom has it that
3347480	3354600	men are a lot more visually like like we're a lot more given to this thing called fetishes
3354600	3360920	that are visual because there's something that's more like like we're more able to associate
3360920	3366920	imagery with that goes right to our libido and and women aren't like that I don't know if that's
3367480	3372920	uh uh passe now if that's like just something that we've become that we became accustomed to
3372920	3378200	thinking about men and women in the 70s and 80s or 90s and now we're starting to actually second
3378200	3381800	guess that I know for sure there's always going to be somebody that's going to stand up and go
3381800	3386680	I'm I'm I'm a woman and I'm totally visually stimulated and they're not going to be lying
3386680	3392680	but I also like it how can you have general conversations about sex remember that that
3392680	3398280	ray finds movie that guy what's that guy what did he find out he found out we're fucking insane
3398280	3402840	we're all insane because none of us talk about sex with each other so we don't uh you know we
3402920	3407320	have you guys ever watched porn together you and I'm talking about Liam Neeson uh Liam Neeson right
3407320	3413160	that way he finds Liam Neeson's here everybody for the 100th are you kind of comfortable watching a
3413160	3418440	little pop pop into video and watch a little porn together well in the way that Dan's established
3418440	3428520	that his porn is just ladies that are that have that have like a ledger and no no we have never
3428920	3434520	never watched we have never watched we have never watched porn together never watched porn together
3435880	3438040	otherwise do you watch porn with your girlfriend no
3440520	3444760	what kind of and I think it's I think it's great when couples do uh I think it's great
3446920	3450840	we should really I don't I don't care whether or not they do I think I think if they do I think
3450840	3454440	that's I think that's I don't know if I talked about it when I did your uh this feels terrible
3454440	3459080	but I did it a girl a long time ago and she brought home we did it for like like 45 minutes
3459080	3462920	I think and uh but she brought home some porn and she wanted it she's like she I've never watched
3462920	3468760	porn with a guy before I went to a video store I bought some porn and one of the titles was let's
3468760	3480280	play pussy darts how do you win how do you win how do you win that's Erin's next question
3480280	3489240	how did they know who won I'm assuming that's the guy saying it to the woman like wait am I
3489240	3495080	the dartboard that's the worst let's play oh it's just a euphemism I was actually trying to picture
3495080	3499720	like they probably started playing and then they got caught up in the moment and they didn't finish
3501080	3506360	let's play this led by these titles before we'll never know who's the best at pussy darts you know
3506440	3512360	you know what bums me out it's the new the new thing in the 21st century the new uh porn thing
3512360	3517720	where they don't they don't they're not they don't have to come up with pun titles anymore
3517720	3523160	when they do the flint bones and the robocock and stuff like now it's now it's just they now it's
3523160	3530040	just like like the new thing is it just says like you know uh xxx brady bunch or this is not uh
3530920	3536600	uh flash gordon i don't know what the fuck godzilla godzilla the porn version like the
3536600	3542440	titles aren't clever anymore godzilla the porn version wait are the pussy darts in that movie
3542440	3547320	just penises i didn't watch the movie i think pussy dart pussy darts must be just a euphemism

3554600	3560280	pussy every everyone can always feel like a winner yeah it's like like bullseye again but then but then
3560280	3570440	women are just just have targets so then it's a bummer uh we gotta let's get spencer up here for
3570440	3581720	for this conversation hundreds episode spencer he's a hundred times the spencer

3597640	3603880	what i said yeah at the end of that movie does the woman uh look at the guy slash the camera and
3603880	3612680	say nice grouping the camera just the camera just pans out or pulls back and it's just a bunch
3612680	3617560	of penises like like somewhere like on our stomach like that's what you miss it somewhere in the head
3619000	3623720	that one's a redo they just shake hands at the end and say good game

3631640	3635480	thing that's something this is this is uh second hand but it's not like anyone's not going to
3635480	3640760	believe me because it's but like so somehow the topic of porn came up and then somehow and then
3640760	3646360	from there the topic of these gangbang videos came up where they said there's just you know
3646360	3651160	there's these gangbang videos where it's like like it's just like though let's set the record
3651160	3656120	let's make sure the most the most men ever can have sex with this one woman and it's very like
3656120	3660840	you know it's it's just she's she's on a vinyl ottoman and and and it's just like a
3661640	3667720	warehouse full of men and it's it's it couldn't be less sexual if you made it just the weather uh
3667720	3676600	it um but it's like like like then the top of the dvd case would say like 150 or 200 you know
3676600	3681240	there's like trying to like it's like an arms race the um somebody was talking about one of
3681240	3687080	those videos that they saw and it's just men what like uh who was this person i can't i can't

3697000	3700840	even that good but i just like the guy that we were talking about those videos where there's
3700840	3709160	just like these lines of guys and then you can see like you can see a guy like two friends uh
3709160	3713400	and uh yes race is important to this story one of them was white and one of them was black and
3713400	3718520	they're like whispering to each other and and and giggling and then they both got into the line and
3718520	3725240	came up and then the black guy went went first and he he finished uh and then his white friend
3725240	3731720	that you could see off camera like like like out of focus like giggling with him uh then then then
3731720	3739160	ran up as his black friend uh uh went away and and and announced in a kind of stilted like

4220680	4230760	episode um so so uh so i say to spencer like a guy picking his nose it's weird i say that stuff
4230760	4235720	and then spencer says like i don't i don't care like those are the people i would pick my nose
4235720	4242360	in front of strangers on the road yeah fuck them and i said and i heard myself say it and then i
4242360	4247160	realized fuck i really fucked up it was like i would pick my nose in front of people i knew
4247960	4251880	way before i would pick my nose in front of someone that i would never see again in my life
4252600	4258680	because their opinion is what really matters and i was like wow i have like syphilis of the soul
4261240	4265080	i i would tend to feel the same way that spencer does but i wonder if maybe that
4265080	4269880	the way that you feel makes you a better person damn because you you want to respect the people
4269880	4275240	that you know but i agree i've done grosser things like around people that i don't know
4275240	4279320	other than people that i do but wait do you you're i want to respect the people that i do know
4279320	4284200	no i i'm no he's willing to know and and disrespect the people that you know i guess
4284200	4290760	but like you're less worried about the well wait i feel like each person is like a character that's
4290760	4296120	like like like i feel like i feel like i have a hundred tries with jeff to be a decent person
4296120	4301400	and i if i if i if i if a stranger like that's why i'm always like really freaked out in public
4301400	4307160	about like you know just like you know people like you know in the next booth oh you're right
4307160	4312280	you are you're a worst person yeah because i feel like those people like i'm like yeah you really
4312280	4316200	care about their opinion like they're god or something like those are god's eyes because i'm
4316200	4320920	never gonna see them again yeah yeah you'll yell at me like if i'm being too loud in public or like
4320920	4329320	being too like you know womanly what or it's like i don't know i was trying to make a joke
4329320	4333640	about you telling me what to do in public but like but but you do you do care about the way that
4333640	4337000	i don't know it goes back and forth with you like when you took your flight with dino
4337560	4341720	a couple of days ago you didn't care about the people around you but other times i did though
4341720	4345240	that's why that was my worst nightmare but i was just i was having a good time with dino on the
4345240	4349720	flight out to new york and i knew i knew at the outset and and i had a witness this time because
4349720	4355240	it was the for the adult swim up front so that guy jj that has had the grill in his teeth at the uh
4355400	4359960	friends that he was sitting a couple rows back and he was and he came up to me and he said what
4359960	4363400	the fuck did you do on that flight i said i don't i we were laughing we have a good time he's like
4363400	4367880	god damn i was watching the whole thing i'm like they're not doing anything jesus dan harman can't
4367880	4372920	not get into trouble like like people just don't like what happened well just this you know flight
4372920	4379080	attendant came and crouched down as in the midst of dino and i just like we're just being happy
4379080	4382680	and remember remember you know remember our flight yeah but we were shit well we were
4384520	4390200	vegas for 17 years and we like should have left a long time before we we we we looked like trouble
4390200	4395320	i believe she came and squatted next to me and she said you see you know somebody somebody asked
4395320	4400840	me to tell you guys could you please keep the volume down you know um there uh i think that
4400840	4405320	was the that was the someone's working well then i think maybe that information came later because
4405320	4410360	i was just like i just get devastated i'm like like i'm i'm going from the height of my happiness
4410360	4417320	just having a great time i'm laughing were we the loudest people in in in first class probably if
4417320	4424200	you're gonna bother to chart it but that but like everyone else had headphones on like it was like
4424200	4430120	like we were we were also not being very loud in my opinion i'm pretty self-conscious about this
4430120	4435160	stuff because my worst nightmare is what happened which always happens to me which is this
4435320	4439960	woman squatting down next to me and saying like could you guys pipe it down you know like you're
4439960	4444520	fucking you're bumming someone someone on this plane who will forever remain nameless and faceless
4444520	4451160	wishes you would fucking die and go to hell um and and then just okay and then i can't go from
4452280	4459000	i'm having a good time i love my life to i'm having kind of a good time i'm gonna go from
4459000	4463160	that to fucking i want to slash my wrists i hate it when people say that they're going to play
4463160	4466760	devil's advocate but i'm gonna play devil's advocate you just said that that happened this
4466760	4472680	happens to you all the time yes are you maybe the common denominator in this like this happens to
4472680	4477640	you all the time do you think that just the world is against you wait do you perceive well you and
4477640	4482520	you tell me you've been with me for three years do you perceive me as a loud person in public no
4482520	4488840	i don't i'm just going if i told you that i get that i get chastised a lot in public by by and
4488840	4495240	i get stared at a lot in public and like if i told you like how many times per year someone in
4495240	4500600	a restaurant like like stops what they're doing and leans over their booth and says like excuse me
4500600	4506120	i i'm listening to what you're saying and it's it's it's it's uh you know i myself am in an
4506120	4512280	improv troupe and uh it's a good it's a it was a helpful workshop for me and i don't think it's
4512280	4517080	fair to say it's just like the thing you said that really how often does that happen to you per year
4517080	4521960	if i told you six times per year for me would you go like okay something's weird or would you
4521960	4528680	just i mean am i what what did what did i ever do i'm just telling you it just happens to me all
4528680	4532520	the time and you guys remember when we were in scotland did we talk about this when we went to
4532520	4537000	the uh my girlfriend's from a small town called south queen's fairy went to this uh little museum
4537000	4541800	and on the high street this is a small street and we had gone to a we'd woken up he's like we're
4541800	4545720	gonna go to pub crawl there's seven bars along the street and we're gonna start at one end we're
4545800	4550360	gonna do all the pubs and we did them all and it was great fun and this is a cute little quaint
4550360	4555240	street it has it's unchanged for hundreds of years very quiet and quaint and cutesy and it's
4555240	4561400	like pub antique shop pub pub antique shop restaurant pub and there's a little museum tiny
4561400	4564920	little two-story affair we go up there and there's a little old lady who looks like a librarian in
4564920	4569880	ghostbusters and she's not a typewriter and she's like she's just like quiet and not talking and
4569880	4573720	dan goes i gotta go pee so he's like you go as far as i know you go off to look for a
4573720	4577800	restroom then you're gone for like 15 20 minutes and erin's like where's dan and we're like i don't
4577800	4583000	know and and then we found out that there was no rest restroom in the museum so dan had gone elsewhere
4583000	4588280	so erin says i'm gonna go look for him so kate and i are upstairs with uh with the little cute
4588280	4595160	old lady on a typewriter which is amazing and uh it's graveyard silence midday along south
4595160	4604360	queen's fairy high street and then i just hear dan what are you doing i lost my wallet
4605240	4610360	get over here get back here i lost my what are you doing you guys you couldn't have been far
4610360	4614920	enough away that you couldn't have walked and had that conversation and the little old lady
4614920	4622440	turns up she goes did he just say he lost his wallet i said we all heard it and the whole
4623000	4630120	city i couldn't i i couldn't i was standing outside a bar that i had attained special
4630120	4635560	permission to walk out of because there was no cell phone coverage i hadn't paid for my drink
4635560	4641960	because erin had my wallet i had i had bought a drink as i always do i had bought it i had bought
4641960	4646920	a story is that on the street no cell phone coverage i had bought a drink because i felt
4646920	4651160	like a homeless person using their bathroom i didn't know if i don't know if things were like
4651160	4657640	you know if that was a trans cultural thing but i felt very awkward walking in and using a
4657640	4662680	place's bathroom and then walking out so i went to the bar ordered a pint used their bathroom
4662680	4669720	came back couldn't pay for the pint my phone has i can't text erin the phone has no coverage
4669720	4675320	and then i so i go i explained the whole thing to this poor woman who's like did not buy a ticket
4675320	4682040	to that ride but but now everyone's like eyeing me because it's like american werewolf in london
4682040	4686520	like i i just like i i'm just like this like guy that's got this fucking story and i'm like i'm
4686520	4691080	just gonna step outside i just said cell phone coverage i just i know i can't pay for the drink
4691080	4694920	now and it's it's like i just seem like a very suspicious character at this point and i see you
4694920	4699880	walking out of the pub and i'm just waving at you like so i'm tethered to this place by virtue of
4699880	4706680	financial accountability i have told i have made a big deal out of if i make a break for it grab
4706680	4713000	the pitchforks so i'm like staying so i'm just like like and there's erin and she just keeps
4713000	4719880	she's she's tethered by outrage the burry man uh i really want to a museum and is just screaming
4719880	4725240	at me and i'm screaming at her and that's what you heard yeah oh god and so the next day you
4725240	4729320	so he deck has back we find out he had to go back to all the bars we went to that day to find his
4729320	4736280	wallet i never lost my wallet no no i had he had given me his wallet i was holding onto his
4736280	4740760	wallet he went to the pub he came outside i didn't know where he went we were about to just hear a
4740760	4746120	weird what was the story gonna be actually so then we met a man with a red hat i thought i thought i
4746120	4749160	thought you'd actually lost your wallet you went to you actually had to go look for your wallet
4749160	4754360	after that but you'd had it in your purse yeah yeah he had given me his his his wallet because
4754360	4760600	for for some reason and then the yeah so there was this this moment when dan and i are a hundred
4760600	4766840	yards away from each other and i'm in the most angry way possible waving and yelling because
4766840	4772520	i really wanted him to see my reason was dumber than his because i was like you have to see this
4772520	4778520	exhibit i really at the i wanted him to see the burry man yeah and so i was screaming the burry
4778520	4782360	man is here which must have been even weirder for the museum lady because she was like no one has
4782360	4787000	ever been this excited about that no one's and also no one's ever been in that museum before it
4787000	4791960	yeah but dan was well someone was in there and took a piss and had some cats with him
4792600	4798680	dan was fuming on the other side so anyway based on the smell it did smell like a cat beat in there
4798680	4803160	like or somebody yeah i think i think the difference is that you nobly so this is something
4803160	4809160	i admire about you dan is that like you have a lower tolerance for people like strangers trying to
4810120	4815560	like get their own fun out by telling people to stop doing stuff and i'm more i'm more willing
4815560	4819720	to be like oh i'm so sorry i'm so sorry i fucked up but you stand up for yourself and for the
4819720	4824440	people you're with well i could yeah i don't know i couldn't decode that but i just i'm terrified
4824440	4829320	i'm terrified of strangers in general so i get more mad at them when they when they fuck with
4829320	4836600	other strangers i i get i i do i tend to do what they say over my own best friends like i'll just
4836680	4842280	go like fuck it it's not worth it this total stranger is being high maintenance let them have
4842280	4847480	their high maintenance moment don't let this moment be about us in a bumper car ramming into
4847480	4853400	them don't don't give them that story let them be this ignorant blustery person that's just
4853400	4860440	speeding through our lives path of least resistance daoism let them through and and and so sometimes
4860440	4866920	that ends up with me like like like like actually like being more respectful to total strangers
4868120	4869880	than to the people closest to me
4872120	4877000	what what you you just spent the last eight seconds of me talking making these weird
4877000	4881160	plastic man faces like you're like you're a turbo teen you're going to turn into a car
4881160	4892200	now what were you going to say um i don't know i guess i disagree you disagree with what i was
4892200	4899080	just saying i do yeah you disagree that i have respect for no i think you're respect for other
4899080	4903400	people but i haven't seen this behavior that you're talking about this like that oh you're talking
4903400	4911080	about when i get mad at like bouncers bartenders waiters threshold guardians parasites people
4911160	4917800	who are those people don't count i understand what you're saying you're you're thinking of
4917800	4923480	specific stuff these people are a blight like they they uh people who have put themselves in
4923480	4928520	a station where they have decided to lord over one little section of earth and make everyone else
4928520	4935880	miserable yeah i don't like like those people tried to keep my dad poor okay all right i think
4935880	4944760	it's fair to make them feel bad about themselves flight attendants waiters dmv clerks cops pedestrians
4945480	4948760	lawyers on our flight you and i were pretty insensitive by the fact is we thought we were
4948760	4952680	having just a good old time we weren't like barfing and stumbling down the aisles we got in
4952680	4957880	our seats on a southwest flight from vegas back to la and yeah we were drunk but we were i didn't
4957880	4962120	think that we were causing any trouble we were giggling like mad but like it's a flight back from
4962120	4965960	vegas and that's i've i've done that flight a million times everybody's a little bit drunk
4965960	4969640	and everyone's giggling and whatnot and the flight attendant came up to us or was it the
4969640	4975000	fucking pilot like that's like somebody so somebody with some fucking epaulettes came over
4975000	4979000	and came over like you guys good yeah it was a flight attendant first right flight attendant
4979000	4982920	came over first i think we told the story already the flight attendant came over first and said okay
4982920	4987240	would you guys would you guys like something to drink asked us that and then i said like oh do
4987320	4993080	you have a kettle one vodka she's like no we don't it's like well then whatever whatever vodka you
4993080	4996920	have and then you order something she's like okay well have you guys already been drinking
4996920	5003160	though a little bit like she she like let us down this canal it was so fucking rude we had to like
5003160	5009240	adjust the citrus and fucking like in our mind like she conjured images of cocktails in our
5009240	5014920	thought balloons like we were mario and luigi trying to grab a fucking magic hamburger and and
5014920	5020520	then made it go away and said like uh yeah you're drunk fuck off and we're and we're and then and
5020520	5024280	then she was like so can i get you a soda or anything like that and i was like no no i was
5024280	5028760	like i kind of chastened and just felt bad and and then and then so she then she walked away
5028760	5033320	five minutes later some dude comes up i think it was just another flight attendant but it was like
5033320	5038440	she was like in the front of the plane maybe going like i like like now her sensitivity is an issue
5038440	5043720	like like now she feels like chastened so so he came back and said but we made a joke
5043720	5048280	when she walked away we it wasn't like oh it was like we have a bomb on the plane we didn't do that
5048280	5053800	but we said that's like like we kind of went like oh like like like we we we did crack wise as she
5053800	5059080	was walking away i think we gathered up with little shards of our integrity fucking like cradled them
5059080	5065080	in our little pathetic palms in a post 9 11 world where these bureaucrats are newly empowered and
5065080	5069160	it's like like it was a fucking worst man we didn't do anything wrong and i never do anything
5069160	5076360	wrong and anyone that says i do is a is the is an enemy of of the people and the people don't
5076360	5084680	include anyone in the service industry uh all right anyways uh it'll be in my blog uh i don't i
5084680	5089080	okay i don't know i don't have any rules i just think it's straight straight strangers opinions
5089080	5093240	are important to me i don't know why it's like like that's the weird thing the the isolating
5093240	5098520	weird thing the scientific experiment or the car next to you is it is a unique one because as
5098520	5104360	spencer pointed out you're literally never going to see those people ever again and there are some
5104360	5109000	people who are liberated by that enough that they'll just jam their pinky up their nose
5109000	5113160	while they idly stare by there are some people who just like fuck with you like look over at you
5113160	5117000	and like like make weird faces so like they're kind of like they're like hey it's like an aquarium
5117000	5121560	like who would have i and i struggled through the logic of it like well we're on los feliz
5121560	5124760	boulevard i mean these people take the same route and i was like no i don't really think
5124840	5128840	i'm ever going to see these people again their opinion is valuable to me precisely because i
5128840	5135160	am never going to see them again strangers that's why i sit on twitter and and people go like i love
5135160	5139560	you thank you thank you so much uh six seasons and i think of the problem and then the one person
5139560	5144680	goes like you douche and i and i go all right stop and everybody stop what's your name
5146680	5152360	samantha samantha what the fuck what makes me a douche i want to know what makes me a douche
5152920	5159400	you tell me you tell everybody step right up everybody the douche detector's here
5161640	5167160	please for your enjoyment planet earth i present to you samantha the douche expert
5167720	5174840	oh what was the first inclination that i was a douche uh i i just i just was bored
5176440	5181480	oh you were bored and then and then everyone else was always like how come you never
5181480	5189240	just say thanks when i say i love you is it because you hate me for loving you no i just like
5189240	5194280	i i like like like what is that what is this is a fucking like there's a dead pixel on my screen
5194280	5201960	i gotta fix it every every person you contact is like a you're running your fingers your life
5201960	5206920	your life is running your fingers over this harp the billion strings what if you found out that
5206920	5212440	someone who's nice to you on twitter was a server or a bartender or uh i was being glib about that are
5212440	5218040	you saying dan that you that you like you feel more defined by the opinions of like of anonymous
5218040	5221880	people strangers than the people that you're close to like your friends family like yeah because it's
5221880	5227960	like the backscatter machine like are you trusting the uh the waves that are being objective and
5227960	5234680	moving through your body uh and probably giving you cancer um like when we x-ray ourselves when
5234680	5240440	we take measurements of ourselves we trust the strangers among the particles and things we don't
5240440	5246760	trust the things that are stuck to us we don't we don't define our we we we measure things we seek
5246760	5252200	objectivity so you say so friends can't friends opinions of you can't be valid because they're
5252200	5255800	they're too subjective well they've yeah they've entered into a relationship with you they have a
5255800	5261160	covalent bond now their electrons are they're sharing orbits well and i think in your ideal
5261160	5265400	world your family would be just every stranger that you met but then the second that you had a
5265400	5272360	conversation with them then they would drop away they would just fall away right well i hope because
5272360	5276840	i mean you're not close to your family yeah but they i mean you gotta ask them about that
5278120	5285080	they waited on me once and they brought me a lot of wrong water
5285080	5295320	wrong water it was ice yeah it was solid what what's what's up with that uh i don't yeah i don't
5295320	5304040	know i will i mean you your reactions to what i'm telling you guys in a confessional state almost
5304040	5314520	sounds subjective well no uh persecutorial like like you guys are not only just seeking
5314520	5318680	information you're actually trying to get me to feel something about this i think we're trying to
5318680	5324120	get to the bottom up but i i do think that you you perceive uh any kind of probing question as
5324120	5328680	as persecution sometime i feel like i think you you feel accusation when there isn't one sometimes
5328680	5333480	i'm definitely yeah i'm definitely erring on the side of people wanting me to change when i'm
5333480	5341080	talking to them uh well i mean we we love you i mean it's it's all it's all nice we just talk a man
5341880	5346680	um we just chatting i mean it is funny the like i
5349080	5354040	you look so bummed out right now you look really i mean the speech that you made about like strangers
5354040	5359560	and stuff were confusing to me i don't want you to feel bad or change or whatever but like your
5359560	5365400	perception of the way that you interact with the world is is uh this is great it's great
5367480	5370280	it's certainly very different than me because i don't give a fuck about strangers i don't care
5370280	5374680	about anybody i don't know that thinks about me and i mean i mean i mean not not not completely
5374680	5378840	but like you know but like like if someone someone they don't know like fuck i don't give a shit i
5378840	5383160	would definitely would chart my course by people that i'm close to and people whose opinions i
5383160	5388200	respect like that people that i've like i'm closer to like i really don't give much of a fuck about
5388200	5394520	like the i mean yeah you're not i don't know i think i said one of the things i really appreciate
5394520	5401080	about you is i feel like you're less stressed out about getting the approval of strangers and
5401080	5406200	small moments like that like i know like i don't know i think we're all we're all saying
5407320	5411960	the opposite thing every other sentence and between the three of us our behavior is virtually
5411960	5417240	identical and i feel like if i just said what you guys say instead of what i say that you wouldn't
5417240	5422200	be able to it's not that different like you guys are like bring you down but i guess there's
5422840	5427400	like i with bartenders and like i've been a server and i've been a thing and a thing
5427400	5434760	so i have a certain sensitivity to people who are waiting on me that and i and i and not that you're
5434760	5439320	insensitive because you're not you're not an insensitive person you're you're very very kind
5439320	5445880	wonderful person but like we have a different idea of like what it is to be like mean to a server or
5445880	5451400	a bartender or a flight attendant or whatever i feel like you're you're quicker to dislike
5451400	5454840	one of those people than i am and maybe i'm more prejudiced than you are
5455480	5460840	can i maybe you're doing the right i'm i'm i'm quicker to dislike but you're more prejudiced
5461400	5467160	i mean more like i'm more uh this is the most boring yeah i know i know i know it's like 60
5467160	5473640	minutes if it was about nothing except and also twice as long as 60 minutes i apologize i just
5473640	5476840	don't want you to know you're being attacked i think it was about something we kind of we kind
5476840	5482440	of fell off of it yeah but it was like talk about gender to the extent that to the extent
5482440	5485800	that it has the possibility of getting specific it feels like we're getting caught up in these
5485800	5491800	general semantics where if i go like i'm more i'm more concerned with strangers opinions
5491800	5495880	than i am with the people closest to me yeah like that's a very that's a very
5495880	5504200	intimate interesting thing to delve into like oh that's not true at all what do you mean that's
5504200	5508840	not true well that one thing and it's like we're now we're just back out into static like it's not
5508840	5514520	now we're talking about nothing uh well sorry sorry i had a reaction to it i'm sorry uh but
5514520	5520680	your reaction to it was was disbelief you thought i was lying well do you really want to talk about
5520680	5526120	this more i thought you want to move on from this i think like i'll talk about it later i don't
5526120	5531640	yes it's disbelief i have a different different perception but i it's silly sorry sorry i'm very
5531640	5536120	sorry okay i always i always feel like the things i say like i don't i never i'm like i
5536120	5540520	can count on one hand the times that i'm thinking one thing and deceiving people let's talk about
5540520	5544680	what you said this morning at breakfast when you said i like uh i like my race more than the other
5544680	5550520	races let's go from there yeah that's i mean that's just because we were eating corn flakes
5550520	5556360	and it was a metaphor i was crying in the corner yeah well he's free to jump in what
5556840	5563800	do you what do you want spencer um well i just i really gotta go about that
5564760	5570760	wow a hundred episodes i was gonna go but then i was like don't want to miss my big moment
5573400	5577960	i'm not i'm not trying to be i'm not trying to be difficult it's like i just really have to be
5577960	5582680	well let's play a little dnd shall we shall we play a little dnd well let's can can i get
5582680	5589880	adam to read can i get to read the dnd thing while i go to the bathroom i'm sorry i i didn't
5589880	5594680	hear you spencer i didn't hear you say you had to that's what i want to have happened
5596280	5599560	go pee spencer can i get adam to read the dnd spencer go pee
5603160	5608680	if we if we had a wireless microphone we could play p and p they're out of paper towels
5609640	5612760	all right that would be spencer could go in and describe his peeing
5617480	5621160	emptying your bladder into the porcelain this is gonna be great this is gonna be great
5622040	5628600	spencer just handed over his dnd game master monologue to adam goldberg who has appointed
5628600	5638040	seattle 2104 it's a goof it's a goof it's a gag uh should we get the music in wow
5643720	5650600	now just don't let these boo adam adam serious question not not joking will you hear this
5650600	5655560	audience kind of bristle and boo at that that's like when you when you kind of lay an egg like
5656040	5659800	a play on words it doesn't quite work or simply coming up on stage
5660840	5665560	hang on hang on kind of come up stage unheralded like when you when you hear that audience reaction
5666440	5671480	like dan was saying that he is more uh affected by strangers uh than by people close up i'm the
5671480	5677480	opposite of that i think you and i are opposites in many ways as well uh again i'm not being i'm
5677480	5683000	not trying to be i'm not trying to be cute um if i hear if i walked up on stage 17 000 times or
5683000	5688440	even three or two or maybe even one and i and i heard that reaction i would leave the country
5688440	5693640	yeah but you there needs to be a bad guy and i'm fine being a bad guy because i like my life i'm
5693640	5698040	happy with who i am okay good and it's easy to have someone don't boom i'm gonna get cheered
5698040	5702840	ironically but i'm saying if it's got to be someone i'd rather be me than erin who spends
5702840	5709320	a lot of time on stage or damn who's just shows about i'd rather be like oh it's this guy boo
5709320	5713880	this guy but you don't mind you don't mind the booze or like i know that they're not going to
5713880	5719800	probably jump me shouldn't have said that sentence but you're not you're not you're not you're not
5719800	5724120	hurt or or negatively affected it is what it is it used to bother me it doesn't anymore but ideally
5724120	5732360	you'd probably rather people be too expensive now audience what i just did was called stalling for
5732360	5739320	time because i'm a goddamn showman i worship you people let's do this fucking thing spencer
5742280	5748520	he didn't read it huh no no i fucking i i i kept him talking like a like a hostage negotiator
5750440	5756920	when we last met our heroes had broken into bill martigan cigarette museum hoping to steal up some
5756920	5763160	cigarettes but no sooner had they gotten inside than they encountered bill martigan the patron god
5763160	5769080	of the city a massive head of cigarettes after some smooth talking sharpie butts a lot managed
5769080	5773880	to convince bill martigan to share his sacred smoke which healed our party and cured their
5773880	5780280	curses sharpie and mole rain had to convince bill margaret bill martigan to help them find the
5780280	5786200	tarragon of virtue but the police arrived forcing our heroes to escape through wizbulb's magic bucket
5786200	5792360	into a gnomish bathroom sharpie had to poop and did so with great gusto while moraine watched on
5792920	5798600	quark left the room like a normal person and came upon a gnome a gnome named fliz dan who was alarmed
5798600	5804520	by the sudden trio shitting in his house after a lengthy and flimsy explanation the gnome was
5804520	5810600	calmed down and revealed himself to be a member of a secret order of gnomes obsessed with discovering
5810600	5817320	the floating isle of paradise i'm so out of breath jesus christ ain't exercising you just peed
5817320	5823240	you're dehydrated and ran i'm not dehydrated but would fliz damn truly be able to aid the party
5823240	5828520	you're dehydrated so i can see hopefully we'll find out this time on harmontown
5829160	5841080	i think it's extra hot i think it's a hot hot summer l.a night yeah i mean i'm just fat and
5841080	5845800	gross because i keep thinking like i'm gonna wear a hoodie all the time because it's like there's a
5845800	5852520	sweat rag on the back of my i keep i keep using my hood to like wipe the back of my gross neck if
5852520	5856120	you didn't wear a hoodie you wouldn't be sweating that much well that's the that's the weird irony
5856120	5860600	is i don't think it's irony i think it's just called mathematics it's not irony yeah it's uh
5860600	5868200	yeah it's not sir opposite of irony this uh total perfect congruence with expectation
5874360	5880200	i'm wearing a big hot sweater with a sweat flap on the back that i used to wipe my sweat off
5880200	5893240	sweat i use my ponytail for that do you really and to swat it flies is the ponytail is the ponytail
5893240	5897160	absorbent enough to take sweat off of your neck i don't know no it probably has the same hoodie
5897160	5901720	effect that you were discussing earlier which i would have brought up if you didn't bring it up
5901720	5908200	jess if you didn't have a long long luscious flowing gorgeous uh romance novel cover hair
5908280	5913080	spencer what kind of haircut would you fancy or is it i don't know that's the reason why i have it
5913080	5919720	like this is because i don't know what it would look like short and wind prop bob do you guys do
5919720	5924840	you remember any of those things i said earlier yes uh so are we in fliz dam's uh like like
5924840	5928840	apartment or house right yeah you're in his house all right so fliz dam you uh you you work for a
5928840	5933720	secret society of gnomes that want to find the isle of paradise yes that's a good summation
5933720	5939160	thank you i hate to be so expository but uh my friend we just took a shit in your house and we
5939160	5943880	have a lot of fighting to do uh it has to be done um we need to get there because we we seek
5943880	5949800	the tarragon of virtue we're told that it exists on the isle of paradise yeah you know i hear that's
5949800	5958920	true is it is a side sidebar with my adventurers and i will clean this up uh but uh handle uh oh
5958920	5966920	it does yeah i'll be damned this is bill martigan's shit son craft crafty bastards you've
5966920	5974840	invented indoor plumbing uh guys uh i use the flesh to mask the sound of my voice what wasn't
5974840	5981320	the point of the tarragon of virtue to remove the curses yeah from uh from uh from christa
5981320	5986840	christa burke yeah didn't we get that removed now is it we well christa burke's is still on
5986920	5992520	oh yeah ours are we're good but christa oh our soul bound like uh yeah that smoky chain curses
5992520	5997240	he's still possessed by demons sorry about the sidebar uh i light a match okay
5999320	6006920	um i walked back out and said uh look take us there i can take you to our secret hideout
6006920	6012920	oh is it on the isle of paradise no is it just your friend's restaurant and you get kickbacks
6013880	6021320	yeah yeah what's at the secret hideout that's where we hang out and gather and talk about our
6021320	6027800	exploits let's go to the secret hideout if you really think we'll be welcome oh yeah you're with
6027800	6036040	me fliz damn you're you're a lot you're let cheer here uh than you were a few minutes ago i shook
6036040	6042280	it off fliz damn what's your rank do you have a certain kind of standing in your society i'd say
6042360	6049800	i mean society like you're numb i'm an acolyte an acolyte yeah it's an important it's good that's
6049800	6055800	good that's good we should go okay let's do it later that's the secret hideout you arrive at a
6055800	6062040	building called the burning sycamore it looks like a a tree it doesn't look like a flaming
6062040	6068520	tree though it just looks like a tree but it is flaming no it's called that though it's confusing
6068520	6077880	yeah so fliz damn he knocks on the door and he goes it is i fliz damn who seeks the no smoking
6077880	6085240	zone all right and uh then he gives a series of complicated knocks on the door and it slides open
6085240	6092680	and just like that that didn't seem that complicated that was kind of identical to
6092680	6105000	of a dead bird just dropped from and you see stairs going up style finally it's really weird
6105000	6112280	as a restaurant i guess okay so let's go and you're sure you're sure it's cool that we're here
6112280	6121160	oh yeah right right the secret part makes us feel like intruders i think remember that's a
6121160	6127800	good point actually we're in that fish for so long yeah the infinifish yeah that was ridiculous
6129720	6137640	i thought it would take like maybe a couple of episodes how do you know about the infinifish
6137640	6142760	what are you talking about oh it's meta metabolism
6146360	6155640	so he goes up he goes up the stairs he goes up i follow him he he leads you up these stairs into
6155640	6161000	it looks it's pretty shitty it looks like a like a tree house there's posters on the wall that that
6161000	6165960	are maps that are crudely drawn and you just see a bunch of old gnomes it just looks kind of like
6165960	6171400	a gnome bowling club or something they're they're hanging out on these lounge chairs that are all
6171400	6175720	old and messed up and they're just talking and some of them are holding these weird flutes of
6175720	6183800	liquid it's probably a beverage but um as as flizdam gets in he introduces himself he says
6183800	6192440	i am here flizdam i am and um everyone kind of looks at him uh-oh and one of the guys speaks up
6192440	6201160	hey who are these guys and he looks at you i think we just realized we were taking flizdam's
6201160	6209000	word for it that he's totally cool here uh we are we are we are friends of uh flizdam
6209560	6214680	and uh gnomes in general we're adventurers and we're seeking uh help and passage to the aisle

6293560	6300440	stricken friend uh who is a curse laid upon him that only the tarragon of virtue may allay and
6300440	6307800	a swage and i was seeking passage are we to the isle of paradise then you and i are of two minds
6307800	6315240	if i understood most of that which i think i do because we're gnomes you and i oh yeah yeah can
6315240	6320280	i borrow a cigarette oh yeah you're a gnome i bet you you love jokes as much as i do you know
6320280	6325560	you'd think that but we here the seekers of paradise seek a very particular kind of paradise
6325640	6333080	that our people call the no smoking zone you see we believe that smoking poisons our culture
6333080	6340680	and our bodies and we hope to seek a paradise free from the evils of smoke it's unhealthy
6341640	6347880	okay i i don't need a cigarette i'm good that's that's very good to hear all right you know
6347880	6353800	but you said the word of two minds are you also uh gonna gonna you know not sure what i said back
6353800	6361640	there i think charles hoffman was saying that yeah yeah well i mean so yeah so uh about that
6361640	6367640	tarragon yeah you know i'm sure it grows up there everyone says that right how do we get there
6367640	6372360	charles hoffman oh well that's the best part you seem like a guy that knows because everyone else
6372360	6377400	has given us the real dick around yeah man we've been searching it you see it goes around in the
6377400	6382600	sky all over the place it's hard to chart its position but we've uncovered a relic that we think
6382600	6390360	could lead lead us to paradise what is it we don't understand it it's it's a stone tablet with
6390360	6396760	strange markings and we just we just can't decipher it charlie you read uh strange markings
6396760	6409320	don't you absolutely i uh i i did a semester at sea so um can you show us this tablet you never
6409320	6416200	know with us tall folk uh up here higher than you guys we get exposed to different languages
6416200	6422840	that's what i was hoping would happen because you see i have this stone stone tablet here
6423880	6430440	and i will present it to you if you could solve the riddle therein it looks like a
6430440	6433960	simon from the 80s i don't know what are you talking about what are the 80s
6434120	6441400	huh i think the the listener needs to know that that that spencer is holding up his ipad
6441400	6448360	and on it it's great for the 100th episode of a podcast it's uh yeah it's a uh can you solve it
6448360	6453480	you guys seem so familiar i reach over and i touch the red uh the red part of the simon looking thing
6453480	6457000	okay
6458360	6461000	the tablet cracks into 100 pieces what the fuck
6466280	6472760	i thought it was a simon yeah and in its space you see a magical rippling portal that threatens
6472760	6478440	it doesn't even threaten it begins consuming everything what the shit it just looks like a
6478440	6482920	game if only we had been here when the game started you know it's like you just hit a random one
6483400	6490840	25 chance so you feel yourselves being compelled into this portal to who knows where
6493000	6496760	it's terrifying it hurts in fact you feel you feel pain
6500760	6508680	uh we wait we wait to see what happens next all right can i uh i throw i throw my rope around uh
6508680	6520760	gross i throw my rope around a sconce kick and uh tie the rope i have the rope around my waist
6521880	6531800	and i throw it to sharpie and and uh quirk uh so as to anchor ourselves you throw the rope and uh
6532360	6536280	well one of you has to catch it which one of you wants to catch it i guess can we both
6537080	6540920	you could both try i guess but you don't throw a rope at two people that's weird
6541960	6545720	well yeah i do because i loop two loops it's called a mickey mouse throw
6548360	6548840	okay

6627960	6633800	well you should have pressed start yeah you don't start with a color that's crazy
6634520	6639960	if the game's already on you know the whole game is to simon whatever is happening nothing had
6639960	6646200	happened yet you had to press start oh well look the die is cast motherfuckers flying flying
6646200	6653000	through the portal like uh like a like one would fly through a portal you get like mario and luigi
6653000	6660520	in mario and luigi searching for a magic hamburger yeah thank you so much for calling that up
6662280	6666440	i wanted to say mario and luigi's searching for a magic hamburger
6667000	6672920	because that would be so ridiculous in the mario luigi universe

6681080	6686680	yeah and you're sucked through and now you find yourselves in a magical pasture you see colors
6686680	6692760	brighter than any colors you've seen before and colorful flowers and happy little trees and bushes

6772200	6777480	in order for you hitting a button to make the game be over i agree that means the game had
