28000	29000	Yeah!
29000	56000	We are silence christened tonight but
57000	59000	More than enough to the tap today.
59000	62000	We've got a fantastic guest we are all very excited about.
62000	64000	First lets bring out the mayor of Harmanstown, Mr. Dan Harman.
64000	75000	Alright, knock it off.
75000	76000	Knock it off.
76000	80000	Lets quit screwing around and start the show.
80000	82000	Yeah, we've got classy friends in the green room.
82000	84000	We don't want to send the wrong people.
84000	85000	Behave yourself tonight Jeff.
85000	87000	I'm going totally free right now.
87000	88000	I didn't bring my iPad.
88000	89000	I'm just going off the phone.
89000	95000	And I didn't even bring my little notepad where I doodle and write jokes that I never say down.
95000	97000	We've got an adult guest tonight.
97000	98000	There's grownups in town.
98000	99000	Yeah, behave.
99000	103000	Somebody that I want to walk out of here with a high opinion of me.
103000	107000	You know, like, well, you know, it's like...
107000	108000	I'm nervous.
108000	109000	Yeah.
110000	116000	When I found out who our guest was and I thought that you two are going to be here with that guest,
116000	119000	I got excited just to watch you guys talk to this guest.
119000	120000	Interrupt each other.
122000	123000	Yeah.
123000	124000	Are you nervous?
124000	125000	I'm nervous.
125000	127000	We were all kicking it backstage.
127000	131000	I said we should have brought the audience back into the green room just to hear that conversation.
131000	134000	Yeah, we kind of finished our interview back there.
134000	135000	But anyways...
135000	136000	And we sent them home.
136000	137000	So it's cool.
138000	148000	We woke this morning to just beyond tragic news that just makes no sense at all.
148000	156000	The line producer on Rick and Morty, Mike Mendel, who was the nervous system.
156000	158000	It's too easy to say heart.
158000	164000	I mean, he held the show together, is still holding the show together.
165000	166000	He's gone.
166000	167000	He died.
172000	175000	I don't think I've ever experienced this kind of...
175000	177000	This particular flavor of grief.
179000	181000	Like, it's...
182000	183000	I don't know.
184000	192000	We have this culture in TV, no matter how modern and progressive we get,
192000	196000	no matter how sensitive and gentle we become.
196000	202000	Underneath it all, all of the men and women are...
202000	206000	I think we pride ourselves on an almost militaristic mindset.
206000	210000	Like, we're doing something so important here that requires so much discipline
210000	214000	and hierarchy and collaboration and intuitiveness.
214000	221000	That it simultaneously dehumanizes the people you work with
221000	224000	while making them the most important people in the world.
224000	226000	And it's like...
226000	228000	Some kind of like...
232000	234000	I just...
234000	239000	I don't know if it's just my narcissism or if this is a common thing that people experience with grief.
239000	241000	But like, I just...
241000	246000	You hear that someone is gone and then I'm immediately parsing it as...
246000	249000	What is wrong with me? What's wrong with me?
249000	251000	What have I done?
251000	254000	Like, why am I like this?
254000	256000	Because...
256000	260000	Why do I not understand that every single human being on Earth,
260000	262000	like the ones you know, the ones you don't know,
262000	265000	but especially the ones that you rely on every day,
265000	270000	the people that you just, in the truest sense of the phrase, take for granted,
270000	273000	like, why don't we go...
273000	277000	How is it so hard for us to go about our fucking day-to-day
277000	281000	understanding that it's, while very unlikely,
281000	286000	but perfectly possible that someone will be gone tomorrow
286000	290000	and why can't we treat everybody, you know, and ourselves?
290000	293000	I don't just mean like, oh, I was mean to this guy.
293000	295000	I wasn't...
295000	298000	What I was was completely just...
299000	305000	I just didn't regard him as anything other than a load-bearing pillar
305000	308000	of what we were doing.
308000	312000	That there would one day be some silly vacation
312000	317000	to celebrate retirement or something, some opportunity,
317000	323000	maybe even the funeral of a person that was supposed to go
323000	327000	on some schedule that I apparently think death works on,
327000	333000	where we would finally sit down and interact as human beings.
333000	337000	And it just...
337000	341000	That's my narcissism, parsing another person's death.
341000	344000	It's all about me, I guess.
344000	349000	But I just feel like...
349000	352000	I feel like I'm made of straw tonight.
352000	355000	Like, I feel like if I move too quickly, my hand will fly off.
355000	358000	I just feel like everything is so delicate and...
358000	360000	How long had you known him for?
360000	362000	Well, he's been there since the beginning.
362000	366000	I mean, since the moment that it became not a little pilot,
366000	371000	a little idea to the moment that it needed to start pulling up its big boy pants
371000	374000	and being on the air, he was there.
374000	381000	And he was unmistakably the reason why we're able to take something so childish
381000	387000	where there's people having me sign a corporate, manufactured thing
387000	390000	where the name of the character is Mr. Poopy Butthole.
390000	393000	The reason why you can be that stupid and childish
393000	402000	and yet be so lucrative, compatible with mainstream society
402000	407000	is because the guy is making the trains run on time.
407000	412000	It's coming to us from The Simpsons and the world of getting the job done.
412000	415000	If everybody was like me and Justin,
415000	420000	you'd be watching two episodes of Rick and Morty every eight years.
420000	424000	And it was out of the blue. I don't think I ever met him.
424000	425000	Totally out of the blue.
425000	428000	And Levi said he was with him yesterday and everything was fine.
428000	433000	The crew went to a baseball game.
434000	438000	The upside is that he was surrounded by co-workers
438000	441000	and they were all having a great time.
441000	443000	They had a great time and he went home.
443000	446000	His wife and he just put a daughter in college
446000	448000	and I just think it's such a roller coaster ride.
448000	454000	All of these things, I guess that's the bargaining phase of grief where you're kind of like,
454000	458000	well, okay, well, good thing he doesn't have a kid that's like six.
458000	460000	And then I'm like, are you kidding me?
460000	464000	A young adult has to spend, they're crossing the threshold into the rest of their life
464000	468000	and you get this kneecap.
468000	472000	There's a little hatch here.
472000	475000	I do two things. I go numb and I get mad.
475000	478000	And I think that comes from upbringing.
478000	481000	There's a hatch here where if I were to open it,
481000	484000	which I won't do because it's bad podcasting,
484000	488000	but it does have to do with thinking about his wife,
488000	491000	who Rob and I was one of the first people that we worked with.
491000	494000	She was the casting director on Heat Vision and Jack.
494000	497000	And I'm just, I don't know.
497000	501000	They were two lovely people. They were just like great, wonderful people.
501000	505000	It's that thought because then that connects to the idea of my God,
505000	508000	like what if something happens to Cody?
508000	509000	What if something happened to me?
509000	515000	And it's just that, yeah, I'm opening that hatch by saying I'm not opening that hatch.
515000	519000	I can't go there.
519000	525000	My deepest sympathies and condolences to his family.
525000	530000	And yeah, I guess that's, you know,
530000	535000	I felt like I'd be remiss in not saying that this happened,
535000	541000	but at the same time, I could have said nothing.
541000	544000	I don't, I don't consider it our job to stop the world.
544000	547000	And that doesn't do anybody any favors.
547000	550000	I just very confused.
550000	555000	I think there's one more thing that I would say about it,
555000	561000	which is like the continual frustration throughout the day of like
561000	564000	wanting someone to say something that finally makes it make sense,
564000	568000	which I finally atoned with by around 3 p.m. today,
568000	571000	where I suddenly realized that, wait a minute,
571000	578000	you know, I hope, I don't,
578000	585000	my big pet peeve with the deaths that we encounter is people making too much sense of them.
585000	588000	I've talked about that here before.
588000	591000	As I was telling Dino today, like, you know, Dino and I,
591000	594000	no matter what we do until the day we finally die,
594000	601000	and no matter how we die, if Dino or I like walk under a piano and it falls on us,
601000	603000	people are going to make sense of that debt.
603000	604000	They're going to go like, well,
604000	608000	he had a problematic life and he was probably in the wrong place at the wrong time.
608000	611000	And that piano was, had his name on it, you know, the way,
611000	613000	the choices he made.
613000	616000	That's my big pet peeve is like, is the way we,
616000	619000	in spite of the fact that as we all know,
619000	621000	Dave Foley drinks 50 cups of coffee a day.
621000	626000	Like, okay, so there's an instinct in us that no matter what happens to Dave,
626000	628000	if he lives to 110, great.
628000	631000	If Dave, something terrible happens tomorrow,
631000	634000	there's that we want it to make sense because we are afraid of death.
634000	637000	So we want to like go, this happened because of that.
637000	638000	Okay, I got that figured out.
638000	640000	And I think the subtext of that is this really,
640000	642000	really arrogant idea that we're,
642000	646000	all of us left belong to some club that made the right decisions.
646000	650000	And that is really offensive.
650000	654000	And so I, at least I got to, because it was so, it was like,
654000	658000	I was getting angry about the, the, the nonsense of it.
658000	660000	Like, this is a healthy man. He played hockey.
660000	664000	He was, he was, he was, he was ripped man.
664000	669000	He was like visceral and he, and,
669000	673000	and, and I'm like, what someone tell me something.
673000	676000	And then, and then I finally came around to, no,
676000	677000	nobody tell me anything.
677000	680000	And please, dear God, give me a senseless death.
680000	682000	Give me a confusing one.
682000	688000	Let me go quickly and let me let people be puzzled by it.
688000	693000	I think that may be the equivalent of leaving a little pencil splash
693000	696000	in the pool and an Olympic dive, you know,
696000	702000	just like no turbulence to the point where people are like, how'd that work?
702000	707000	So God speed you, Mike, and I'm,
707000	711000	I wanted to just to make it about me one more time.
711000	713000	I just, I am.
713000	718000	I can't believe that guy left this world,
718000	722000	a world where his story ends with Trump being president
722000	727000	and me still working on a fucking draft of a, of a, of a script.
727000	730000	I just, I hope he was not,
730000	741000	I hope his last like moments weren't fucking having to deal with my horrible bottleneck effect on production.
741000	747000	When I like working on this fucking draft and he's the guy that has to,
747000	749000	he's, he's, he's got to be the hero.
749000	753000	He's got to, he's got to, he's got to absorb all that energy.
753000	764000	I just, I just, I just, I hate myself for not,
764000	767000	for not turning that thing in so that, but it's,
767000	771000	it's stupid because getting to go to a baseball game is more important than,
771000	776000	he wasn't going to get joy out of me finishing a draft, but all right.
776000	778000	So I talked enough about that.
778000	780000	I had one item on my list,
780000	783000	but it was kind of like, I think maybe, maybe Spencer.
783000	788000	It's probably for a Spencer night, but I don't want to make,
788000	791000	I don't want you to feel left out.
791000	793000	You're saving your best up for Spencer.
793000	798000	I was just like, I don't know this term, hot swappable with hard drives.
798000	802000	Like I don't, yeah, Spencer.
802000	803000	I just think it's a lie.
803000	807000	Like you get a, you get a drive, like a little thing that like,
807000	811000	Oh, this reads these kinds of cards or these, these discs that it's hot swappable.
811000	816000	And the implication there is that, Oh, so I can like poke a little stick into my computer.
816000	818000	I can write some stuff on it and I can pop it out,
818000	820000	throw it in the other thing that I want to think.
820000	823000	And the computer won't go, Hey, what are you doing?
823000	825000	Oh, inject much.
825000	828000	But it does do that no matter what.
828000	831000	There is no such thing as a hot swappable drive.
831000	832000	Thank you.
832000	835000	I'll be, I'll be Spencer for you during this.
836000	837000	I think he just did it.
837000	838000	That was it.
838000	839000	Yeah.
839000	841000	I think I was, I was just going to add.
841000	842000	Yeah, man.
842000	843000	Yeah.
843000	844000	Yeah.
844000	845000	It's rough.
845000	846000	Yeah.
846000	847000	Yeah.
847000	848000	Yeah.
848000	851000	What you really want to do is you get yourself a network card.
851000	852000	Oh man.
852000	853000	Oh man.
853000	856000	You got real blazing speeds there.
856000	857000	Real blazing speeds.
857000	859000	Where is he?
859000	861000	Where is Spencer?
861000	862000	Spencer goes from that low.
862000	863000	Yeah, man.
863000	866000	Like he gets, he's down here, but then he gets really up here.
866000	869000	He goes, he's got a lot of, he's got a lot of range.
869000	871000	I don't know where Spencer is.
871000	872000	Are we worried about him?
872000	875000	Well, he's not here and you're doing reverse.
875000	876000	Hot swappable.
876000	877000	Yeah.
877000	879000	I mean, maybe Spencer's hot swappable.
879000	882000	He's just, he's just at a different podcast.
882000	887000	I really hope this is not a long answer, but what is hot swapping?
887000	890000	That's where you poop on somebody's chest, right?
890000	891000	Well, I would say a stint.
891000	896000	I mean, I think in general, the concept is just the idea of being able to, uh,
896000	899000	Steve leaving on the booze, everybody.
899000	902000	Hello, Steve.
902000	903000	That's an option.
903000	904000	What happened?
904000	905000	Spencer took the night off.
905000	906000	Oh.
907000	908000	What?
908000	919000	Poor, poor, poor beleaguered, uh, salt mine worker.
919000	920000	Rob shrub.
920000	924000	Oh, you owe your soul to the company store, right?
924000	926000	This poor guy.
926000	928000	That's an option.
928000	929000	What are you?
929000	930000	Fred Flintstone.
930000	931000	I'm Mr. Slate.
931000	932000	I got you.
932000	933000	Just whipping you.
933000	934000	Yeah.
934000	938000	You know, I got to make you come talk to Ed Neumeier, the author of the RoboCop
938000	939000	screenplay.
939000	941000	That was an awkward way to introduce our guest.
941000	942000	Let's bring out Ed Neumeier.
942000	952000	Hello, Ed.
952000	960000	Dan, don't screw this up.
961000	964000	This is really important to me tonight.
964000	970000	Uh, I'm sorry about those awful chairs.
970000	975000	Introduce or give him the, uh, you know, the introduction that a fellow of his
975000	976000	stature deserves.
976000	981000	I mean, I would, my introduction of you would be one of my like rambling things
981000	984000	where Jeff would cut me off and say, please welcome Ed Neumeier in the middle of
984000	985000	me trying to introduce you.
985000	989000	Cause I'd be like, look, we've had some legends up here.
989000	991000	Um, I get, I get nervous.
991000	993000	I am a bad interviewer.
993000	997000	I leave it, but, but there's a, there's a difference here where it's just like
997000	999000	genuinely you are a hero to me.
999000	1005000	Um, uh, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're a person that just exemplifies
1005000	1009000	like not only the, the, to me that what we'll talk about, whether you think this
1009000	1018000	is true, but demonstrates the highest kind of like, uh, Coda of, uh, of, of, of,
1018000	1020000	of the craft of, of writing movies.
1020000	1027000	Uh, and, and also like demonstrates that that pays off that you, you pick your
1027000	1030000	shots and whatever, but let's, let's, let's, let's get to know you a little bit.
1030000	1037000	Cause, um, uh, God, I'm a bad interviewer, but, um, I think that, um, we'll, we'll
1037000	1039000	quit. We'll go through the early biography.
1039000	1043000	Like you, are you a Californian or you were born here?
1043000	1046000	I was actually born in Vienna, Austria by, by chance.
1046000	1050000	And I grew up in the Marin County in San Francisco Bay area, Marin County.
1050000	1052000	I grew up in San Salma.
1052000	1054000	And you were a journalism major.
1054000	1057000	Uh, my parents were both journalists.
1057000	1060000	And so I sort of was that, that followed me through high school.
1060000	1064000	I was, uh, I was the editor of my high school newspaper and, uh, but I always
1064000	1065000	want to do movies.
1065000	1066000	Yeah.
1066000	1067000	Was there anything too?
1067000	1070000	Cause I was also a journalism major and my justification for it being from
1070000	1073000	Wisconsin was that I couldn't possibly.
1074000	1079000	Make the leap to, uh, well, I'm going to major in writing.
1079000	1081000	I'm going to, I'm going to be a writer.
1081000	1083000	I'm going to be creative for a living.
1083000	1089000	I had to find a Midwestern compatible version of being a person that sits at a
1089000	1094000	typewriter that also felt enough like welding to, to, to, to, it was there
1094000	1097000	anything to that, but, or is it just more,
1097000	1100000	it was kind of the first time I ever had a little thing where you could do
1100000	1103000	something. And I immediately started turning it into a place to do.
1103000	1108000	I used to do violent satires of, of like my friend who was the school president.
1108000	1112000	We shot him in the, in the, we shot him in front of the school sort of, we did
1112000	1114000	Zapruder films and things like that.
1114000	1119000	And certainly like propaganda is such a huge part of the, some of the most
1119000	1122000	effective parts of the things you're most known for our Robocop Starship
1122000	1125000	troopers, like both, um, really interesting things.
1125000	1126000	Talk about.
1126000	1131000	And, but, um, uh, both of them have these Shakespearean heralds that are the
1131000	1132000	media.
1132000	1137000	Uh, uh, and, uh, so I imagine like, I think they, I was always interested in
1137000	1138000	that stuff.
1138000	1141000	And I was literally all my, a lot of my, some of my friends now were my, you
1141000	1144000	know, people who were like Woodward and Bernstein were big guys.
1144000	1146000	And so I like know the guys who knew them and stuff like that.
1146000	1149000	I know a lot of people, a lot of journalists and that kind of thing.
1149000	1151000	And those, that was an exciting idea.
1151000	1152000	Yeah.
1152000	1154000	That here was the, the chorus.
1154000	1155000	I don't know.
1155000	1156000	It was an interesting device also.
1156000	1157000	And it was cheap.
1157000	1160000	You could, uh, you have a lot of, you could do a lot of things without spending
1160000	1161000	any money.
1161000	1164000	It's the same as having a guy come out and explain the Montagues and the
1164000	1165000	Capulets.
1165000	1168000	That's like, they, they, this is like, well, here's, here's what's going on.
1168000	1173000	But it all, but the more important thing is that unlike that guy, um, the
1173000	1178000	world as a character, you know, Detroit is a character in Robocop.
1178000	1183000	It's so important to understand the relationship between people and media,
1183000	1184000	what's going on in the world.
1184000	1188000	And even though the whole story takes place in a really gritty local part of
1188000	1194000	this new earth, um, you're, it's so, it's so effective to have a, to be able to
1194000	1196000	zoom in from a global perspective.
1196000	1197000	Right.
1197000	1200000	And show other little parts of that world and imply a bigger world.
1200000	1202000	And that was always there.
1202000	1205000	Uh, and it was something that I think Verhoeven and I had a big fight about
1205000	1208000	that at one point, because I always wanted it to be completely separate from
1208000	1210000	the story that it was different.
1210000	1213000	He, he would say at one time, he said, well, we should, maybe we'll be in a
1213000	1217000	TV, a studio and you'll see the news and you'll, and I, and I was like, I don't
1217000	1218000	know why it was this way.
1218000	1220000	I was 27 years old.
1220000	1221000	I was like, no, that was terrible.
1221000	1222000	You can't do that.
1222000	1223000	We had a huge fight about it.
1223000	1224000	Oh, really?
1224000	1227000	Yeah. And then he came around and he said, okay, all right, I get it.
1227000	1230000	And then we, he said it was more, he said, oh, that's actually more modern.
1230000	1231000	That's a really Brechtian idea.
1231000	1234000	I don't think he said Brechtian, but it is a Brechtian idea.
1235000	1236000	Um, okay.
1236000	1237000	Well, yeah, I'm kidding.
1237000	1242000	So cause part of this is your story is interesting because Robocop, correct me
1242000	1244000	if I'm wrong, this is your first, that's your first screen credit.
1244000	1246000	It's your first project.
1246000	1247000	Right.
1247000	1248000	I, I, I came to the business.
1248000	1253000	Uh, I went to UCLA film school and, uh, and then my girlfriend broke up with me
1253000	1257000	and I couldn't finish UCLA film school, but I, I got a job on taxi and, uh,
1257000	1262000	they paid me $175 a month or something to be a, uh, a runner.
1262000	1263000	And I did that for a while.
1263000	1267000	You were a PA on taxi and we, which made us immediately go, oh,
1267000	1269000	was there an intersection between you and Sam Simon?
1269000	1272000	And the answer is no, but no, no, but I did, I did, I used to,
1272000	1275000	I was the guy who used to sit outside the door and,
1275000	1276000	and wait for the script pages.
1276000	1280000	And I had to drive them to a place called Barbara's place and they typed them up.
1280000	1282000	And then I had to pick them up at six in the morning.
1282000	1283000	And Barbara's place was what?
1283000	1284000	It was a typing place.
1284000	1286000	It was just where you typed your scripts up.
1286000	1287000	This was before there were computers.
1287000	1288000	Yeah.
1289000	1291000	Anyway, so they would type it.
1291000	1292000	They would type it.
1292000	1293000	It's not a copy place.
1293000	1294000	It was like, they would just type them on.
1294000	1297000	No, they would literally, there were a bunch of people who sat up,
1297000	1300000	mostly women who sat up all night and retyped the scripts.
1300000	1301000	And then they were delivered.
1301000	1302000	So they would take like,
1302000	1305000	they would take drafts of like with notes on them and stuff like that.
1305000	1307000	And just do a clean copy of that.
1307000	1308000	Right.
1308000	1309000	Because there's no word processing.
1309000	1312000	So, so a writer's assistant and they would drive them in their little car
1312000	1313000	and then go pick up a box of scripts.
1313000	1316000	We were talking about this, like this afternoon, like how there's so,
1316000	1320000	there were so many roadblocks back then, you know,
1320000	1323000	and people still got stuff done.
1323000	1324000	Where's it today?
1324000	1326000	It's like, Oh, I can't connect with a wifi imprint.
1326000	1327000	Fuck it.
1327000	1328000	Just fuck it.
1328000	1330000	You know, it's like, I mean, including us.
1330000	1331000	Yeah.
1331000	1333000	But we were talking today about, you know, as, as,
1333000	1336000	as people tend to in the loss of a colleague,
1336000	1338000	we're having drinks and we're suddenly going through our whole lives.
1338000	1340000	And yeah, we were, we were,
1340000	1344000	we were briefly marveling at how we had a radio show in Milwaukee and how
1344000	1346000	we would, I would get up at 5am,
1346000	1347000	drink two pots of coffee,
1347000	1351000	write five scripts, get in a car, drive them down icy roads to a Kinko's,
1351000	1354000	because they had a printer, um, and, uh,
1354000	1358000	and pay them the money that they wanted to, to print up these scripts and
1358000	1359000	then drive.
1359000	1361000	It's like, I never, yeah, I would never do that these days.
1361000	1362000	Yeah.
1362000	1366000	Um, anyways, but, um, you, uh, so, and then right from that PA job,
1366000	1369000	it says, I'm going to your Wikipedia page.
1369000	1374000	Like is so, um, uh, joyfully, uh, Spartan.
1375000	1379000	Um, you, you, you go, you, you're a proofreader at Paramount.
1379000	1380000	No, I was a, a script reader.
1380000	1384000	I was a reader in the story analyst guild and they pay people.
1384000	1388000	You probably doing coverage to do coverage for executives and you read
1388000	1391000	everything that comes in and you do a report on it.
1391000	1393000	Yeah. They call it proofreader on your Wikipedia.
1393000	1395000	You're going to, somebody's going to bring the hammer down.
1395000	1398000	Do you remember any of the scripts that you read that went, this is great.
1398000	1399000	Yeah.
1399000	1400000	Somebody, no, no, I did.
1400000	1402000	I remember reading Star Wars.
1402000	1405000	And I read war games and I said, you should make this movie.
1405000	1408000	And they said, nobody wants to see a movie about nuclear war.
1408000	1413000	And then you said, but I can get you Dabney Coleman.
1416000	1420000	And then, and then I read a script, which I really, I made my reputation
1420000	1422000	at Columbia pictures on these.
1422000	1425000	I read a risky business and I wrote a coverage for it.
1425000	1428000	It was like 18 pages long, which is not what, you know,
1428000	1430000	not what you want when you're an executive at the morning meeting.
1430000	1432000	I said, this is the greatest movie in the world.
1432000	1433000	You have to make it.
1433000	1436000	And there was a memo came around and said from Frank Price,
1436000	1440000	the chairman saying that there would no longer be any coverage longer than
1440000	1441000	two pages.
1441000	1445000	And, and then they, then when the movie came out, though,
1445000	1447000	they were interested in me suddenly.
1447000	1450000	And when the movie came out, I bet somebody a hundred bucks,
1450000	1453000	the vice president, that it was going to be a hit and it was.
1453000	1455000	And then suddenly they offered me a job.
1455000	1459000	And I, for a moment, I was an executive who had his finger on the,
1459000	1461000	on the, on the, on the pulse of youth.
1461000	1462000	Yeah.
1462000	1465000	And that lasted for about, about a year at Universal.
1465000	1467000	And I wasn't really suited for it.
1467000	1469000	I read that you were offered to be the vice president at,
1469000	1471000	at Universal or some, some.
1471000	1473000	I was, I was on a track.
1473000	1475000	I was, they called them CEs now.
1475000	1477000	There wasn't, I was a junior executive and,
1477000	1480000	and that's sort of how I learned all the business stuff, if you will.
1480000	1482000	And I was, I was under a VP.
1482000	1485000	And yes, if I had stayed there, I would have been a VP,
1485000	1488000	which I later was at another production company, Martin Ransohoff.
1488000	1491000	I was the VP of development and, and stuff like that.
1491000	1493000	And this is where it gets really interesting.
1493000	1498000	This is why, where I start to kind of worship you in the story of your,
1498000	1502000	your path, because in the underworld,
1502000	1506000	where the werewolves of suits and the vampires of writers,
1506000	1509000	like are in constant war, like you can root for one or the other.
1509000	1512000	And there's all kinds of hybrids that are exciting and heroic,
1512000	1515000	but there is a war nonetheless.
1515000	1520000	It's like something really romantic about a guy that does what you did,
1520000	1524000	which you can just imagine the biopic, like tee up of this moment,
1524000	1528000	where you have this easier, you know,
1528000	1532000	you're on this path and then for whatever reason you decide,
1532000	1536000	no, I'd like to go behind door number two.
1536000	1543000	I'm going to, I'm going to abandon this career of being liked,
1543000	1547000	of being on the side that calls the shots, makes the money,
1547000	1553000	because I'm really passionate about this idea I had called Robocop.
1553000	1558000	It's true.
1558000	1561000	During this period I thought I'm really not meant for, I'm not this guy.
1561000	1566000	I don't want to have, I wasn't good at, at returning 100 phone calls a day.
1566000	1569000	And there were people who were, there were people I really admired,
1569000	1570000	who really were good at that.
1570000	1572000	And some of them are good writers too.
1572000	1576000	Mike Waldron, a shout out to him,
1576000	1582000	he was kind of an Ed Newmeyer at Starburns, my little studio,
1582000	1588000	where it was like, you hire young people and you make them do the stuff you're too busy to do.
1588000	1591000	Some of it is reading other people's stuff, taking, you know,
1591000	1598000	it's like he's a very handsome kid from Georgia and people like talking to him
1598000	1601000	and I remember him saying to me, you know, just so you remember,
1601000	1605000	I did come out here to be a writer and I was like, too bad, you're a day walker.
1605000	1608000	Whistlers got more plans for you.
1608000	1615000	But I will return the favor to you if you do this shitty neurotypical stuff.
1615000	1618000	I will help you as much as I can.
1618000	1621000	And I mean, it amazes me that some people are just good at both,
1621000	1626000	that there are charming people who, yeah, they're good writers.
1626000	1630000	They're just cursed with this like networking ability.
1630000	1633000	You know, I don't think I really did. I wasn't comfortable with that.
1633000	1636000	I was never, I never felt cool enough for the job.
1636000	1640000	And when I meet executives over time, they all seem much cooler than I ever was.
1640000	1644000	Do you think, do you buy into the dichotomy of the introvert versus the extrovert,
1644000	1650000	where it's like the introvert is recharging their batteries while they're alone,
1650000	1655000	while they're operating individually and they don't mind interacting with other people,
1655000	1657000	but that's a discharge.
1657000	1661000	And then there are some people who are actually receiving an energy charge
1661000	1665000	from, of all things, interacting with other people.
1665000	1669000	And it gets them through having to play Minecraft, which blows my fucking mind.
1669000	1670000	Like they're just like sitting there.
1670000	1674000	Well, so I hope the phone rings. That's you.
1674000	1678000	When you're sitting at home, you're like, God damn it.
1678000	1682000	I get ants in my pants. I got to go out and be around the people.
1683000	1687000	So that you can recharge and get through those lonely nights,
1687000	1692000	like between the sticks calling you and having you come out to a concert.
1694000	1698000	I don't think we talked about my tour with sticks enough.
1699000	1702000	I replaced Tommy Schott. No, that's...
1702000	1703000	Okay, come on, come on.
1703000	1704000	Yeah, I am an extrovert.
1704000	1708000	I don't think I need other people to totally recharge, but I do.
1709000	1712000	I don't know. I think it's both ways.
1712000	1715000	I need to be alone, but I also need to be around people.
1715000	1720000	And both of those are recharged and discharged in a way.
1720000	1721000	Well, okay. All right.
1721000	1722000	Come on, man.
1722000	1724000	You figure out a way to be...
1724000	1726000	You don't have to choose one or the other.
1726000	1729000	I'm not sure if I can answer this right, but what I would say is...
1729000	1732000	I always want to...
1732000	1735000	Many years ago, when I wrote Robocop and when it was successful,
1735000	1737000	there were times that I would entertain myself of thinking,
1737000	1740000	well, I did this and I did that and I did that and I did that and I did that.
1740000	1741000	Like thinking about...
1741000	1746000	And then now, more and more, I think, well, no, I did that because Paul was there
1746000	1749000	and we talked about this and we did this because John Davison said,
1749000	1753000	well, you can have 25 cents to do that and some tinfoil.
1753000	1757000	And there were a lot of people involved in that process that made it what it was.
1758000	1765000	Age sweetens the recognition that the auteur myth is an auteur.
1765000	1768000	Do you start to open up to...
1768000	1771000	So, Verhoeven and I get together and we've been getting together for 35 years
1771000	1776000	and we've done most of our work over breakfast and we get together now still.
1776000	1778000	We just did recently and the last time we got together,
1778000	1781000	all we did was talk about what a great producer John Davison was
1781000	1783000	and how the movie never would have happened without John Davison
1783000	1785000	in a million different ways.
1785000	1788000	Now, John and Paul didn't even speak during the movie.
1788000	1791000	They couldn't even talk to each other in the room.
1791000	1795000	I was the middle child who would try to get the parents to come in and talk
1795000	1797000	and then they would run out after cursing at each other.
1797000	1799000	But now, they realize that it was...
1799000	1801000	Well, I think they even did that.
1801000	1805000	When you wrote it, did you always, while you were writing this,
1805000	1808000	because this is going to be called Robocop?
1808000	1809000	I did.
1809000	1812000	No, no, it never ever happened to me since,
1812000	1814000	but it actually...
1814000	1816000	I was working as a reader.
1816000	1819000	Then Columbia Pictures was out, not in Culver City,
1819000	1822000	but it was in Burbank on a lot called TBS then,
1822000	1824000	which is now known as the Warner Brothers lot.
1824000	1827000	And I had an office right next to one of the...
1827000	1830000	It was a trailer office and it was right next to one of the big back lots.
1830000	1832000	And suddenly, they were making this giant picture,
1832000	1836000	this giant science fiction picture, which no one would tell you what it was.
1836000	1837000	And I would get out of...
1837000	1839000	I would leave my office and I would go out onto the set.
1839000	1842000	And what I really wanted to do in those days was make a movie.
1842000	1844000	And there were so many people on this movie
1844000	1846000	that they didn't know who was working on it and who wasn't.
1846000	1847000	They were shooting all night.
1847000	1849000	And so I would go and work on the art department
1849000	1852000	and stay there until about three or four in the morning.
1852000	1854000	And I said, so what's the first night?
1854000	1855000	What's this movie about?
1855000	1856000	It's about a robot.
1856000	1860000	And they pointed at a girl in a tutu and said, that's a robot.
1860000	1862000	And it was Blade Runner.
1862000	1864000	And then I watched them shoot some of Blade Runner.
1864000	1865000	I was on that...
1865000	1867000	The set, it was extraordinary.
1867000	1868000	I never seen anything like it.
1868000	1872000	And then about three o'clock in the morning, one night,
1872000	1876000	I sort of had this idea of what I thought a robot should look like on that street.
1876000	1878000	And it was looking...
1878000	1880000	It was a robot that looked a little like Robocop.
1880000	1882000	And it was next to that blue car.
1882000	1884000	They call it the spinner.
1884000	1888000	And suddenly the title just came into my mind.
1888000	1889000	Like, Robocop.
1889000	1890000	Boom.
1890000	1891000	And it was really weird.
1891000	1893000	And I think it's the power of location.
1893000	1894000	I truly do.
1894000	1895000	If you are on a...
1895000	1896000	It's very...
1896000	1898000	At least for me, location and architecture and things like that,
1898000	1901000	are very creative ideas come to me in that.
1901000	1905000	And I think that was such a supercharged set for a young man to be on.
1905000	1906000	Like, and...
1906000	1909000	Now, looking backward through...
1909000	1912000	So, that kid who's having that moment is like,
1912000	1913000	okay, I think I'm going to write this movie.
1913000	1914000	It's going to be called Robocop.
1914000	1915000	It's...
1915000	1916000	I don't want him to be in a tutu.
1916000	1917000	I want him to...
1917000	1919000	Whatever happened to the...
1919000	1921000	It's a very shrobby sounding thing.
1921000	1922000	This is Rob Shrob.
1922000	1923000	I'm Rob Shrob.
1924000	1927000	To be like, come on, it's a robot.
1927000	1928000	Hello?
1928000	1931000	If you knock on it, your hand should hurt.
1937000	1939000	And after like 30 years, it becomes a...
1939000	1941000	That was an original poster.
1941000	1944000	The poster for you kids was...
1944000	1948000	It was Robocop climbing out of the car and the poster said,
1948000	1951000	part man, part machine, all cop.
1952000	1954000	And I remember being 15 and I was like,
1954000	1956000	here's the thing is that until you see that movie,
1956000	1958000	until you see a frame of it, it...
1958000	1960000	I mean, you're a wash in a world of like,
1960000	1963000	oh, Spielberg came out with six pieces of crap.
1963000	1965000	One of them will stick and write history.
1965000	1966000	And like, you're very...
1966000	1968000	You're jaded even back then.
1968000	1970000	So, and you have permission to be jaded.
1970000	1972000	And I saw that poster and I was like,
1972000	1973000	this is...
1973000	1975000	This misses the mark.
1975000	1976000	This is silly.
1976000	1977000	Like, what do they mean, Robocop?
1977000	1979000	Like, Shrob said backstage.
1979000	1981000	It's like, it sounds like a kids movie.
1981000	1984000	Now, this is the difficult part of the question.
1984000	1987000	It's like, so this kid who's like visualizing this,
1987000	1992000	at that point, where are you at tonally?
1992000	1994000	Are you thinking to yourself, like,
1994000	1998000	that part of the point of it is that it's...
1998000	2000000	It's going to be a disarming,
2000000	2004000	like hypodermic for some seriously,
2004000	2007000	like potent kind of edge.
2007000	2010000	Or are you simply at that time going like,
2010000	2012000	gee whiz, robots are swell.
2012000	2013000	Yeah, no, no.
2013000	2016000	I think the answer is there were two levels going on.
2016000	2018000	There was, this has to be a movie for eight year olds
2018000	2019000	or whatever.
2019000	2022000	And this has to be a movie for people who were thinking.
2022000	2024000	And it can be both of those things at the same time.
2024000	2026000	I don't think I immediately thought that.
2026000	2027000	What I thought was,
2027000	2029000	I want to make a movie about business
2029000	2032000	and how the corporate world is a dangerous world.
2032000	2034000	I wanted to see businessmen killing each other.
2034000	2036000	And that that was because...
2036000	2037000	You weren't thinking that.
2037000	2038000	I was thinking about that.
2038000	2039000	Oh, okay, sorry.
2039000	2040000	And that's what I was really...
2040000	2041000	I'm sorry.
2041000	2042000	What I was really thinking about at the time
2042000	2043000	was before robots even was,
2043000	2044000	oh, I want to do a world about business
2044000	2046000	where executives actually kill each other.
2046000	2047000	Okay, and so that title,
2047000	2050000	the idea that that would always be called that title,
2050000	2052000	and the fact that that title sounds a little silly,
2052000	2053000	that's...
2053000	2056000	From the very beginning, that was all as designed.
2056000	2057000	It was...
2057000	2058000	You were thinking,
2058000	2064000	it's like naming your movie like Mr. Stretchy or something.
2064000	2066000	It's kind of like supposed to sound childish,
2066000	2067000	like a product.
2067000	2068000	I used to say it's good.
2068000	2070000	I used to say, oh, that's really stupid,
2070000	2071000	meaning that's really good.
2071000	2072000	Right.
2072000	2073000	That's really wonderful.
2073000	2074000	Fucking love it.
2074000	2075000	Fucking love it.
2075000	2076000	Fucking love it.
2076000	2077000	That was my...
2077000	2078000	Best movie ever.
2078000	2079000	Oh, that's kind of stupid.
2079000	2080000	Let's do that.
2080000	2083000	Monster house.
2083000	2085000	The house is a monster.
2085000	2089000	Kung Fu Panda.
2089000	2091000	But it did imply another part of this world
2091000	2093000	that also had to support all of that.
2093000	2096000	And the more difficult part of it was to convince people
2096000	2098000	that it could be funny,
2098000	2100000	and everybody wanted it to be straight.
2100000	2101000	And it was...
2101000	2103000	I always knew it would have impact,
2103000	2105000	but I really had this theory,
2105000	2107000	maybe someone else had had it,
2107000	2109000	but as a young man trying to figure out how to write a screenplay,
2109000	2113000	I had this idea that if you had a really, really violent scene
2113000	2114000	that was shocking,
2114000	2117000	and then you told a joke, even a bad one afterwards,
2117000	2118000	it would be much funnier.
2118000	2121000	And that was one of the things that was vested throughout writing.
2121000	2122000	When I think of the movies,
2122000	2124000	we all love this movie to pieces.
2124000	2129000	We always talk about what are the few handful of just perfect movies
2129000	2132000	that you wouldn't take anything out of or add anything to,
2132000	2136000	and Robocop is for us definitely one of those movies.
2136000	2138000	I think it's very sad.
2138000	2141000	It's an incredibly sad film.
2141000	2144000	At the core, it's a really depressing story,
2144000	2146000	and it's really about how he's...
2146000	2150000	I remember, I think what you do when you do something the first time,
2150000	2153000	or what I often hear other people talking about,
2153000	2156000	is you're kind of making up your own rules for how you do something,
2156000	2158000	and you have to figure it out yourself.
2158000	2160000	And that was really, that was me trying to figure out something.
2160000	2162000	How does three acts work?
2162000	2164000	Here's the beginning, middle, and the end.
2164000	2165000	I mean, boy, you...
2165000	2167000	Holy shit, you nailed it.
2167000	2168000	You wielded the fucking...
2168000	2169000	Fucking nail it.
2169000	2171000	It's really intimidating, because I actually...
2171000	2173000	God damn it.
2173000	2175000	I still haven't...
2175000	2178000	I still can't write a decent three act story,
2178000	2186000	but part of my training was trying to get Sidfield's stuff to work for me
2186000	2191000	by deconstructing Robocop and Die Hard, really specifically,
2191000	2194000	and even more so than Die Hard,
2194000	2200000	which I really fetishize a great deal on this stage.
2200000	2203000	Robocop is just...
2203000	2208000	It's uncanny, the structural integrity of that story.
2208000	2211000	Dan, can I ask a bunch of questions here, please?
2211000	2214000	Okay, so...
2214000	2216000	What's it like to kiss a girl?
2216000	2218000	Shut up. Just shut up.
2218000	2221000	Just shut your mouth.
2221000	2222000	Don't listen to him.
2222000	2223000	It wasn't me.
2223000	2225000	Shut up.
2225000	2229000	So how many drafts of this,
2229000	2233000	where, I mean, you wrote it, you on spec,
2233000	2236000	did you do multiple drafts before you started handing it around?
2236000	2239000	Did you start doing multiple drafts when John Davidson
2239000	2241000	and Paul Verhomen got involved?
2241000	2244000	I have a partner on this, so let me get to that.
2244000	2245000	Oh, okay.
2245000	2250000	So the way it worked was I was sort of a semi-miserable junior executive
2250000	2254000	at Universal, and I was trying to meet people that were interesting to me.
2254000	2258000	So I actually put the word out to UCLA film schools,
2258000	2261000	particularly because I'd been there, that anybody who wanted to come in
2261000	2262000	and talk to me could.
2262000	2265000	And so all these people who didn't pay any attention to me before
2265000	2266000	came to see me.
2266000	2268000	Among them, Michael Miner, who was...
2268000	2270000	He was seven years older than I was,
2270000	2274000	and he was kind of a star at UCLA, made a movie,
2274000	2277000	and he had been a DP, and he wanted to...
2277000	2279000	He said, what do you want to do?
2279000	2281000	And I said, well, I'm working on this movie about a robot.
2281000	2283000	And I told him...
2283000	2285000	It's called Robocop, and it's about a robot.
2285000	2287000	And I told him the story, and he was like, oh, let's do that.
2287000	2289000	And I didn't really have anything much better on.
2289000	2290000	I was a little...
2290000	2292000	I'd slowed down a little bit with it.
2292000	2294000	It was taking me about a year since I had done it.
2294000	2297000	So I said, okay, why don't we write a script together?
2297000	2303000	And I had it fairly well outlined, the first act, as it is now, more or less.
2303000	2304000	And I had...
2304000	2307000	The ending was there, and the middle was a little bit more of a mess.
2307000	2312000	And the first thing I did was I kind of wanted to write the first act on my own.
2312000	2314000	I didn't want to hurt Michael's feelings, but I didn't know him that well yet,
2314000	2316000	and I wanted to make sure I was getting it.
2316000	2323000	And so I told my bosses at Universal that my grandfather had died.
2323000	2325000	He had died a long time ago.
2325000	2326000	So it wasn't a lie.
2326000	2330000	So I had to go, and I went back to San Anselmo, where I grew up,
2330000	2333000	and a friend left me their house to work on,
2333000	2337000	and I wrote the first act in about two weeks.
2337000	2341000	And during that time, they sent me flowers, which I felt really bad about.
2341000	2343000	And when I came back, I stopped.
2343000	2345000	I had to go back to work, and I stopped working.
2345000	2346000	And then we started...
2346000	2347000	We kind of finished it on nights and weekends,
2347000	2349000	but the first act sort of set the tone.
2349000	2354000	And then we had a really rough draft, and we gave it to some friends.
2354000	2355000	And I gave it to...
2355000	2358000	I had made friends who knew a guy named John Davison who had done airplane.
2358000	2361000	And I had heard about him, and John Davison,
2361000	2364000	who was a particular character, had a particular way of speaking,
2364000	2366000	and everybody would imitate the way he talked.
2366000	2368000	And I could even kind of talk like him before I met him.
2368000	2373000	But when I had the script, I gave it to a friend of his,
2373000	2376000	a director named Jonathan Kaplan, that a friend of a friend knew,
2376000	2378000	hoping that he would give it to John Davison.
2378000	2380000	And he did give it to John Davison.
2380000	2382000	He said, John Davison would be perfect for this.
2382000	2385000	And it was sort of amazing, because John Davison was perfect for it,
2385000	2387000	for a whole bunch of reasons.
2387000	2388000	Wait, he did airplane.
2388000	2389000	He did airplane?
2390000	2391000	That seems like a weird fit from going...
2391000	2393000	Well, except it was funny, at least.
2393000	2394000	Yeah, exactly.
2394000	2396000	And I wanted this to be funny, so I think that was helpful.
2396000	2398000	Other people read it, and they thought it was serious.
2398000	2399000	And they thought it should be serious.
2399000	2402000	He was the only one who said, this could be funny.
2402000	2403000	And he had the cash.
2403000	2404000	He had proven that...
2404000	2406000	Well, he had a deal at Orion.
2406000	2407000	He was a really...
2407000	2408000	He is a very...
2408000	2409000	A penurious producer.
2409000	2411000	He makes everything as cheap as he can.
2411000	2412000	Penurious.
2412000	2413000	Penurious.
2413000	2415000	That's a new word for me.
2415000	2417000	I probably got wrong then, but...
2418000	2420000	This is the first time I've ever heard that word.
2420000	2421000	He's not just a writer.
2421000	2423000	He makes up words all the time.
2423000	2427000	At what point did the prime directives start coming in?
2427000	2432000	Because I want to talk about the ending at one point, because...
2432000	2434000	Well, how about later?
2434000	2435000	It's an ending.
2435000	2436000	That's why I said...
2436000	2437000	Here's what.
2437000	2438000	I'll pitch you what I want to talk about.
2438000	2440000	You can tell us who's a better...
2440000	2441000	All right.
2442000	2447000	Well, I'm so curious about now the Verhoeven entering this picture.
2447000	2450000	Because I'm picturing the producers, and it's like Springtime for Hitler.
2450000	2454000	This Verhoeven character enters the story.
2454000	2455000	Let me see.
2455000	2456000	Let me fast forward to this.
2456000	2458000	So we get set up.
2458000	2459000	It's like a...
2459000	2464000	We get a deal at Orion, which is a big deal for people who have never done anything before.
2464000	2468000	And we go over there, and they give us some notes.
2468000	2473000	One of the notes was somehow the Clarence, the bad guy Clarence,
2473000	2477000	and the guy at the top, Dick Jones, should be somehow joined.
2477000	2479000	That was the only real work we took from them.
2479000	2480000	That's a good note.
2480000	2481000	It was a good note.
2481000	2483000	And so we wrote a second draft.
2483000	2486000	And midway through the draft, I turned to Michael, and I said,
2486000	2489000	Michael, this can be funny.
2489000	2490000	It's okay if it's funny.
2490000	2493000	And we started having fun writing a script.
2493000	2497000	Now, that has never happened to me since, and it hadn't happened to me before.
2497000	2500000	But it was fun for about two weeks.
2500000	2504000	And we laughed, and we made jokes, and we couldn't believe how entertaining we were.
2504000	2505000	And we wrote a pretty good note.
2505000	2511000	Is that where the absurd elements, the I'd buy that for a dollar runner, or is that...
2511000	2512000	I don't...
2512000	2513000	You know, I'd have to look.
2513000	2515000	I could, but I'd have to look and see with I'd buy that.
2515000	2518000	I'd buy that for a dollar was, you know, I had to spend some time at Paramount
2518000	2521000	around all the, like, all the Gary Marshall sitcoms.
2521000	2525000	So that was my attempt at coming up with a tagline for a...
2525000	2528000	By the way, when your system is shocked, and we all know this from writing a roller coaster,
2528000	2532000	I mean, not only are you having, like, this weird, like, why am I laughing?
2532000	2535000	I'm terrified.
2535000	2540000	So we're already familiar with, like, you can get a good laugh out of somebody who's scared shitless
2540000	2542000	or upset, just, like...
2542000	2543000	Yeah, it's a pressure release.
2543000	2544000	Traumatized, absolutely.
2544000	2550000	But it also occurs to me that it works the opposite way, too.
2550000	2554000	The villains in Robocop are especially traumatizing.
2555000	2560000	And therefore, you're very immersed in Peter Weller's character, Murphy,
2560000	2561000	who becomes Robocop.
2561000	2571000	Like, his conduit to becoming Robocop is a horrible, violent trend.
2571000	2577000	And it's absolutely more horrific because these guys are goofballs.
2577000	2583000	They fancy themselves real cut-ups, and their leader, played by Kirkwood Smith,
2583000	2584000	is like...
2584000	2596000	I had never seen a receding hairline guy with glasses playing a villain in an action movie.
2596000	2599000	That counted as diversity back then.
2601000	2605000	Because he looked like he should be giving James Bond his weapons in a lab,
2605000	2607000	and he's the big bad.
2607000	2613000	And it was so effective, the sway he held over his minions,
2613000	2615000	the way they interacted with each other,
2615000	2618000	the fact that they watched television and enjoyed it,
2618000	2621000	that they went in and out of being grody.
2621000	2623000	It was just, you felt...
2623000	2625000	He taught Bobby how to fly?
2625000	2626000	You felt so...
2626000	2628000	Well, that's an example, yeah.
2628000	2633000	I mean, he's not gonna slow his adrenaline junkiness down.
2633000	2636000	It's like they're throwing one of his minions at the thing.
2636000	2639000	You're watching Peter Weller go into that warehouse,
2639000	2644000	and if you're watching this movie a six, seven, eight hundredth time,
2644000	2652000	you're now realizing that this first act has been so cold riveted tightly
2652000	2656000	that the corporate story has been mentioning offhand,
2656000	2659000	yes, we've been relocating candidates according to risk factor,
2659000	2662000	and that you're going like, oh, God...
2662000	2664000	And Peter Weller was available...
2664000	2667000	Murphy was available for that job.
2667000	2669000	He was a candidate that was relocated according to risk factor.
2669000	2670000	Why?
2670000	2674000	Because his kid loves TJ Laser.
2674000	2675000	He wants to...
2675000	2678000	Nancy Allen asks him, what are you doing with your gun?
2678000	2681000	And he's like, well, I just want to learn this.
2681000	2682000	I want to learn this thing.
2682000	2685000	So is that the desire of the character to be a good cop?
2685000	2686000	Yeah.
2686000	2687000	I think it is, actually.
2687000	2688000	To be a cowboy.
2688000	2690000	I was looking at your story cycle,
2690000	2693000	and I thought, oh, the scene where he says,
2693000	2696000	my kid wants me to be a good cop, and all good cops do that.
2696000	2697000	He has...
2697000	2699000	We're going to find out through ghostly flashbacks,
2699000	2702000	as this character that we become is trapped in this metal cage,
2702000	2706000	we'll find out that he actually had an idyllic life.
2706000	2711000	We can only speculate that it wasn't enough for him.
2711000	2712000	For what reason?
2712000	2713000	God, the best reason of all,
2713000	2715000	not because he was tired of fucking his beautiful wife,
2715000	2718000	not because he wished he had more money,
2718000	2721000	because he felt like maybe he was failing as a dad.
2721000	2724000	And I would say the subtext there was like,
2724000	2726000	you're seeing the flashbacks.
2726000	2727000	The kid is watching television.
2727000	2729000	He's watching TJ Laser.
2729000	2733000	These days, what that would be is the kid was so absorbed in his iPad,
2733000	2737000	or he was literally jacked into some video game,
2737000	2739000	and it was like, how can I reach this kid?
2739000	2743000	I want to become a bigger-than-life thing.
2743000	2746000	I want this kid to understand that law enforcement
2746000	2749000	can be heroic,
2749000	2751000	which is absolutely the opposite realization
2751000	2753000	that this world is going through.
2753000	2755000	They're having their first police strike
2755000	2757000	following the purchase of the police
2757000	2760000	at the hands of a consumer electronics company.
2760000	2763000	And so the cops are having this...
2763000	2765000	There's just so many goddamn details.
2765000	2767000	I just went off on this weird off-road thing.
2767000	2769000	But yeah, I mean, I do.
2769000	2770000	It's funny that you're asking,
2770000	2774000	and that's another thing that I think is so amazing about the job,
2774000	2776000	is that you can ask questions like that,
2776000	2778000	even though you wrote the goddamn script,
2778000	2784000	because this job is about channeling, isn't it?
2784000	2786000	It's not clear how much you can know
2786000	2789000	and how much just comes in somehow.
2789000	2792000	It's really amazing when it happens, and it's not reliable.
2792000	2794000	I truly believe that these things are out there,
2794000	2796000	and that when we're doing our best,
2796000	2799000	we're doing the opposite of proving that we're good at what we do.
2799000	2804000	We're actually only able to untighten some sphincter
2804000	2808000	in us just enough to accidentally let something noble
2808000	2811000	that just needs an antenna.
2811000	2813000	I don't know if it was that we were trying to do anything noble,
2813000	2817000	but it was just pursuing the things you were interested in
2817000	2819000	and really saying, well, this is...
2819000	2821000	I mean, there were all sorts of things that...
2821000	2824000	Like Ed 209, when I sat down with Phil Tippett,
2824000	2827000	we started looking at certain kind of Japanese things,
2827000	2829000	and then I said, yeah, but what this is really about, Phil,
2829000	2832000	is it's really like... It's kind of the Vietnam War.
2832000	2836000	This is a Huey helicopter, and this guy, Dr. McNamara, is there,
2836000	2838000	and I didn't push that there,
2838000	2840000	but I was always in the background there,
2840000	2842000	and then when you look at it, you realize,
2842000	2844000	oh, that is kind of like a helicopter.
2844000	2845000	That is kind of like that.
2845000	2847000	And with Rabotin, who did the suit...
2847000	2848000	So fucking cool.
2848000	2851000	And Rabotin is a great, great artist.
2851000	2853000	I mean, these are...
2853000	2855000	He had him, Phil Tippett...
2855000	2858000	And he said... And one day, many years later,
2858000	2860000	I said, you know, it's really interesting,
2860000	2861000	because it's all about Detroit,
2861000	2865000	and the book I'd read kind of as research for this
2865000	2867000	was a book called The Reckoning by David Halberstam,
2867000	2871000	all about how Detroit and Nissan had gone to war
2871000	2872000	and Detroit had lost,
2872000	2874000	and it was about the decline of the American car.
2874000	2876000	And that was like what I was writing about
2876000	2878000	with the decline of corporate stuff.
2878000	2880000	I was a kid who liked cars, and you know,
2880000	2881000	this was the meaning of it.
2881000	2883000	And when you look at Rabotin,
2883000	2884000	one day I said to Broteen, I said,
2884000	2887000	it really looks like a truck, man.
2887000	2889000	It looks like a ram truck, or something like it.
2889000	2891000	It looks like American Roadiron, and Rabotin was like,
2891000	2892000	oh, I like that.
2892000	2893000	But I think it really did.
2893000	2894000	I think he channeled that,
2894000	2896000	because it looks like a car in a weird way.
2896000	2899000	And they end up at an abandoned steel mill.
2899000	2901000	I mean, it's where he has to go.
2901000	2904000	It's where metal is made and unmade.
2904000	2905000	No, it's all about the rust belt,
2905000	2907000	and that's why it was Detroit,
2907000	2909000	and that's why it was this kind of thing.
2909000	2911000	And I remember the line producers saying,
2911000	2912000	well, come on, we can shoot it,
2912000	2914000	and Los Angeles can go home at night.
2914000	2919000	But somehow going to Pittsburgh to this awful place
2919000	2921000	where the town had fallen apart
2921000	2924000	around this old steel mill that was haunted.
2924000	2926000	And backstage fun fact, we established that.
2926000	2928000	It's Ed 209, and his name is also Ed,
2928000	2930000	so he threw that one in there.
2930000	2931000	I love that.
2931000	2936000	If I could show you a tally of the number of times in 20 years
2936000	2939000	that in the most important of conversations that I've had,
2939000	2942000	and it's important to me relative to what I was working on,
2942000	2945000	how important it was for me to try to communicate something,
2945000	2949000	the number of times that I have referenced story points
2949000	2952000	and robocops so that I could achieve some kind of vocabulary
2952000	2953000	with whoever I'm talking to,
2953000	2955000	whether or not they'd seen the movie,
2955000	2958000	because honestly, as long as I know what I'm talking about,
2958000	2961000	then maybe I have a chance of explaining to this other person.
2961000	2964000	Otherwise, I'm just babbling this, like,
2964000	2970000	paste of fucking, like, non-connected, like, references.
2970000	2973000	But for me to be able to dive into a story
2973000	2975000	that is so well-constructed
2975000	2978000	that I can also then later, when I'm talking to the same person,
2978000	2980000	go, remember that thing I keep referencing, robocop?
2980000	2983000	Well, now we're talking about this part of the story.
2983000	2984000	So again, I'm going to reference that.
2984000	2986000	Now you already know I explained it.
2986000	2989000	But it's like every threshold,
2989000	2993000	the atonement with the father being so literal,
2993000	2997000	it's amazing that that was a note that a suit gave
2997000	2998000	that was like, eh.
2998000	3001000	And it's like, it's such a, from the mouths of babes
3001000	3003000	or capitalists, like, it's just sort of like,
3003000	3006000	I'd like to see both bad guys be cousins.
3006000	3009000	It's kind of a shrug, like, yeah, it'd be easier to follow that way.
3009000	3012000	But it's like, I had heard, like,
3012000	3013000	Brillstein or Gray or somebody,
3013000	3016000	like, when Bob and David pitched Mr. Show,
3016000	3019000	they were like, it should be Mr. Show with Bob and David.
3019000	3021000	Otherwise, people like people.
3021000	3025000	But it was sort of like, you guys should come out
3025000	3026000	and introduce the show.
3026000	3029000	And at the time, I think they thought that was such a ridiculous,
3029000	3031000	like, baby boomerie note.
3031000	3036000	But I mean, it's like, goddamn, what a great note.
3036000	3043000	Anyways, but you could take a stopwatch
3043000	3049000	and you could take a circle and break the 360 degrees down
3049000	3052000	so that every second meant how many pages or whatever.
3052000	3057000	And you can go around that movie and kaboom
3057000	3062000	the moment when Joseph Campbell, who has never met you
3062000	3065000	and who didn't even like movies,
3065000	3068000	is talking about the importance of this sort of,
3068000	3071000	like, going to meet your maker
3071000	3078000	and how the extent to which you are still driven by fear
3078000	3081000	is the extent to which the ogre aspect of the father
3081000	3084000	will present itself and be impenetrable
3084000	3088000	and only through just this cosmic pummeling
3088000	3091000	by that maker's hand are you ever going to atone
3091000	3094000	and become your own maker and realize,
3094000	3096000	I kicked my own ass back there.
3096000	3104000	Robocop has rounded up his road of trials of bad guys,
3105000	3108000	like a Clint Eastwood character.
3108000	3113000	He's haunted by these visions of people who killed his human counterpart
3113000	3116000	and he's going and knocking them off one by one.
3116000	3118000	It's just full of dollars.
3118000	3122000	And then the trail leads to the Clarence Boniker,
3122000	3126000	I believe probably right at the fucking meeting with the goddess point,
3126000	3128000	is like, it's Dick Jones.
3128000	3130000	Dick Jones runs OCP.
3130000	3133000	OCP runs the cops. You're a cop.
3133000	3135000	He just lays it out.
3135000	3137000	But that's a lovely line, isn't it?
3137000	3139000	It's fantastic. All of your lines are lovely.
3139000	3143000	But they're all really like kind of hypertenuated B-movie lines.
3143000	3148000	And you understand that because another thing that makes you a hero,
3148000	3155000	you're the only audio commentary that I've ever listened all the way through on a DVD.
3155000	3160000	And I was just sucked in because you were so,
3160000	3166000	it was like all of a sudden you're just listening to a guy that understands Robocop.
3166000	3169000	And he wrote it.
3169000	3171000	It's just not, you know how it is.
3171000	3175000	You meet people who worked on such and such and you ask them one question
3175000	3178000	and then the very first answer is sort of like, oh, okay.
3178000	3181000	You become disillusioned.
3181000	3186000	It's a prismatic kind of spraying of your mythologization of something
3186000	3188000	into a realization that everything's a fluke
3188000	3190000	and it was just sort of like a bunch of random stuff.
3190000	3199000	To hear a writer on an audio commentary, you're so unabashed.
3199000	3204000	There's a point when Nancy Wilson's character, Nancy Allen,
3204000	3206000	Nancy Allen's character is being introduced
3206000	3210000	and you're describing the importance of Peter Weller watching her
3210000	3214000	and that she kicks somebody's ass and that she takes off her helmet
3214000	3222000	and then she throws it to somebody and then you're just talking
3222000	3224000	and talking about the importance of these characters and things
3224000	3228000	and then you say something like, you're like,
3228000	3232000	and then that's why it was important for me that Murphy had a line
3232000	3236000	and it's coming up right here and I'll loop it for you.
3236000	3238000	Cool stuff or whatever his line is.
3238000	3242000	It was an ad lib that Peter did where he looks at her and goes,
3242000	3244000	pretty neat.
3244000	3246000	He probably needed a line there that I didn't give him
3246000	3248000	but I always thought, again, as a young arrogant writer,
3248000	3250000	I thought, oh, that's a stupid line.
3250000	3252000	So I was being mean by following it there.
3252000	3258000	But if you've ever seen a commentary where the person that's talking
3258000	3260000	is so in sync with what you're watching
3260000	3263000	that they actually just bother to recreationally like,
3263000	3267000	dub the lips of the person as they do a line.
3267000	3270000	And that's when we came up with the hasta la vista baby anyway.
3270000	3272000	It's just so satisfying.
3272000	3274000	It's what you dream of as a consumer.
3274000	3276000	That's because I wrote all the foley and all the background dialogue
3276000	3278000	and everything and was in for the recording.
3278000	3280000	Oh, sarge.
3280000	3282000	That's another 40 pages of writing.
3282000	3284000	Shrops turn.
3284000	3286000	Shrops corner.
3286000	3289000	Let him ask his fucking questions about the goddamn shape of the hat.
3289000	3296000	So anyway, was the prime directives stuff, was that always from the first draft?
3296000	3298000	They were always prime directives.
3299000	3301000	I don't remember what they were in the first draft,
3301000	3303000	but there was always a prime directive.
3303000	3305000	And then we sat down with a guy named Forrest Ackerman.
3305000	3307000	This is why John Davison was such a great guy.
3307000	3309000	He said, I want you to meet this guy.
3309000	3311000	And this old guy in a trench coat comes to sit in his John's office
3311000	3313000	and he says, he's the famous monster.
3313000	3314000	I read your script.
3314000	3316000	Yeah, I didn't even realize how famous he was.
3316000	3317000	I read your script.
3317000	3321000	And well, Asimov said there should be three rules of robotics.
3321000	3323000	So you should have three.
3323000	3325000	So it became three.
3325000	3327000	And one of them, literally, we were at lunch one day
3327000	3330000	and there was a fortune cookie that said, you served the public trust.
3330000	3332000	And I went, what?
3332000	3334000	No.
3334000	3336000	OK, you cheated.
3336000	3338000	Well, hey, hey.
3338000	3339000	I got it.
3339000	3340000	I got the prime directive.
3340000	3341000	Your fortune cookie wrote your movie.
3341000	3343000	The prime directive.
3343000	3347000	That is such a brilliant thing because it is like Asimov
3347000	3349000	and it's a robot movie.
3349000	3351000	So you're going, oh, OK, so we have to do this.
3351000	3356000	But it comes up a couple of, it comes up, I believe, three times in the film.
3356000	3360000	And then finally, the fucking home run of an ending.
3360000	3365000	Robocop is like, off the top of my head,
3365000	3368000	the three best endings, I think, of all time are like,
3368000	3372000	Star Wars, Robocop, and Get Out was like,
3372000	3376000	it's like you're taking your character at the lowest point
3376000	3379000	and then making them go to the highest point.
3379000	3384000	And the quicker you can do that, the more likely you're going to get a standing ovation,
3384000	3387000	which is what I did when he said, Dick, you're fired.
3387000	3392000	First time I saw it in 87, I stood up in the theater and went, fucking yeah.
3392000	3394000	And then as the credits are rolling, I said,
3394000	3397000	we're going back tomorrow to see this movie.
3397000	3399000	This is the best movie ever because it's so...
3399000	3402000	There's something really, really satisfying about the violence.
3402000	3404000	Man, you must have been, when you were done typing that,
3404000	3406000	it went, oh, shit, let's buy some.
3406000	3408000	My fingers are smacking.
3408000	3410000	Oh, my God.
3410000	3415000	You had your shirt off like Hugh Jackman and Swordfish.
3415000	3417000	Holy shit.
3417000	3423000	You went to Barbara's place and made two women leave the typewriters.
3423000	3426000	Because at the end of the second act,
3426000	3433000	he gets his ass kicked by Ed 209 because he can't arrest Ronnie Cox.
3433000	3435000	Because the world is run by money.
3435000	3438000	He can't do anything. He's totally blocked.
3438000	3440000	And then he goes up.
3440000	3442000	And he goes up anyway.
3442000	3444000	He's like, I'm going to get my ass kicked again.
3444000	3447000	But he tells the guy's boss,
3447000	3451000	I can't arrest this guy because he works for you.
3451000	3453000	And he goes, Dick, you're fired.
3453000	3455000	And then fucking kills him.
3455000	3457000	And it's the best.
3457000	3458000	It's so fucking good.
3458000	3462000	But the roar in 1987 was when he said Murphy,
3462000	3464000	which is what's fascinating to me.
3464000	3466000	It's a real, like, where did that come from?
3466000	3468000	And the audience really identifies with that moment.
3468000	3472000	Well, a little segue.
3472000	3474000	But we could go back to talking about Robocop all night.
3474000	3478000	But I do think it's such a weird opportunity your career represents.
3478000	3480000	Because 10 years apart from each other,
3480000	3482000	you write this amazing film.
3482000	3485000	It's directed by this guy who just works perfectly.
3485000	3489000	The chemistry between writer and director clearly creates this thing.
3489000	3494000	And all of the collaborators playing their parts.
3494000	3498000	But to have the same writer and director 10 years later work together again,
3498000	3505000	and to have them be unmistakably doing the thing that they were doing in the other movie.
3505000	3509000	I went to see Starship Troopers, incredibly excited,
3509000	3511000	more grown up now,
3511000	3515000	having spent 10 years asking myself, why do I love Robocop?
3515000	3517000	And learning your name,
3517000	3520000	learning that there's a thing called screenplays and all these things.
3520000	3521000	And I go to see Starship Troopers.
3521000	3526000	And while I'm unmistakably riveted by all of these details,
3526000	3529000	all of this tone, there's something missing for me.
3529000	3532000	And I walked out going,
3532000	3540000	oh, did I misunderstand Robocop's message?
3540000	3545000	Did Robocop actually...
3545000	3548000	Was Robocop not rooting for humanity?
3548000	3550000	What's happening here?
3550000	3553000	There was as much irony and cynicism to Starship Troopers,
3553000	3555000	but I think maybe because it was a war movie
3555000	3560000	and not this movie about this guy, Murphy, the cowboy,
3560000	3562000	the subjective experience.
3562000	3566000	Macbeth, Hamlet, Shane, who just...
3566000	3569000	One movie's a gunfighter, it's about a gunfighter.
3569000	3572000	I think Americans...
3572000	3575000	The other movie comes out of a different genre.
3575000	3579000	It comes out of the movies that were made during World War II to make you go fight.
3579000	3582000	And there are movies like Air Force by Howard Hawks
3582000	3586000	and Action in the North Atlantic by Edward Demetriek or something like that.
3586000	3588000	And they all have this similar...
3588000	3589000	Propagandist kind of...
3589000	3594000	They're propaganda, but they also have a similar structure
3594000	3597000	that they all kind of follow a similar structure in any event.
3597000	3598000	They have a...
3598000	3602000	It's before the war and there's a bunch of people and then there's a war.
3602000	3605000	And then they meet a bunch of other people and they all say...
3605000	3608000	They kind of meet different kinds of people and then they train together
3608000	3611000	and then they learn that one day one of them is going to have to die.
3611000	3614000	Someone's going to have to send someone to die.
3616000	3617000	The thing about...
3617000	3619000	Sorry to cut you off, Ed.
3619000	3621000	It's not as personal a story.
3621000	3622000	Yeah.
3622000	3624000	The thing about Murphy is...
3624000	3628000	We were talking about tone where we can be funny, we can be violent and everything.
3628000	3632000	But Murphy doesn't know he's in a comedy.
3632000	3637000	Everything about it is tragic, he's taking it serious, he's kind of a nerd.
3637000	3639000	He doesn't deserve this.
3639000	3644000	We feel so bad for him because you don't shy away from the violence when he does get killed.
3644000	3651000	You don't shy away from the tragedy of his kid and his wife when they're waving
3651000	3654000	and you're backing away from his home and his life.
3654000	3661000	And I think that's why the tone works so well is that the tragedy is real,
3662000	3668000	the relatability is real and everything else is kind of up to 11 or 12 or whatever.
3668000	3669000	Yeah.
3669000	3674000	Well, I don't think you can discount the power of the trauma of Robocop,
3674000	3679000	the subjective trauma of his true, crime-worthy experience
3679000	3683000	of being the victim of gang mutilation.
3683000	3688000	It's a joke to these sociopaths that he's a cop and he's now in their hands
3688000	3693000	and how much fun they're having torturing him before they finally,
3693000	3699000	in a world that clearly has suffered a certain amount of inflation
3699000	3702000	in terms of the amount of bullets a human body can take,
3702000	3705000	even if they spend too much lead killing.
3705000	3709000	Dr. Weller, I keep forgetting, is Dr. Weller, as of 2014,
3709000	3712000	Peter Weller got his doctorate in Renaissance architecture.
3712000	3715000	I loved his history show, he was so into like ancient Greece,
3715000	3718000	he just really got a boner for pyramids and shit like that.
3718000	3720000	If somebody does 70 movies and gets a PhD in something,
3720000	3722000	you're pretty sure what they got a PhD in.
3722000	3724000	They're pretty passionate about it.
3724000	3729000	I want to watch Robocop tell me about Sumeria all day long.
3729000	3733000	If I was an actor in 70 movies, my PhD would be in cocaine.
3733000	3736000	I'd be dead.
3736000	3741000	Anyways, yeah, I just, and maybe it's because I was an adolescent.
3741000	3746000	So I was coming into your hands, and God was I lucky.
3746000	3749000	I mean, you think about just the crap I could have seen
3749000	3751000	while going through puberty.
3751000	3757000	And I walked out of a theater in Milwaukee just to,
3757000	3762000	I could feel my neurology changed.
3762000	3767000	It's hard to make another generation understand
3767000	3770000	because you can't even say these days back then
3770000	3772000	there was no internet, that doesn't make any sense.
3772000	3776000	But also even the difference between like a world where,
3776000	3777000	like when I,
3777000	3781000	Schwab was the first guy to ever show me like a Jackie Chan movie.
3781000	3785000	It wasn't, you didn't see wire work until The Matrix.
3785000	3789000	It was, previous to that, was a bootleg VHS thing.
3789000	3797000	You had to be looking under rocks to see things that didn't feel like E.T.
3797000	3801000	and to just wander in and for the same movie ticket price
3801000	3807000	have this completely different psychological serum injected into you
3807000	3811000	and to walk out going, why was that funny and violent
3811000	3814000	and why did it love and hate America?
3814000	3819000	Why is it okay for me to be simultaneously rooting for humanity
3819000	3822000	and very cynical about the way the world works?
3822000	3827000	Like why is this movie baptized me into a new religion?
3827000	3830000	I don't, how does that work? Are there other movies like this?
3830000	3834000	It was a lifesaver and just because you bristled
3834000	3838000	when I invoked the word nobility.
3838000	3841000	For me, nobility just means efficacy in our craft.
3841000	3846000	Maybe if we were poets or street musicians or doctors,
3846000	3849000	we, the big three,
3849000	3853000	maybe nobility would have to, but affecting lives,
3853000	3855000	even just making people laugh.
3855000	3858000	I don't even mean to, it's like, oh, you changed a little boy's life.
3858000	3860000	That doesn't have to be the standard.
3860000	3863000	Just reach. That's what we do. It's populism.
3863000	3867000	It's noble when the story is powerful.
3867000	3870000	Listen, I agree with you. There's nothing more important than that
3870000	3873000	in what we do that somehow, I don't know, when you were talking,
3873000	3875000	I think sometimes there's movies that really hit us
3875000	3878000	and it depends on how old we are and it depends on the movies.
3878000	3881000	I feel sometimes I've seen a movie, like when I saw Chinatown
3881000	3884000	for the first time in a theater, I was a young person
3884000	3886000	and I thought I'd been struck by lightning.
3886000	3889000	Chinatown, it seems like, yeah, I can imagine seeing Chinatown
3889000	3891000	in adolescence.
3891000	3893000	I was completely obsessed with Chinatown.
3893000	3896000	I got, before the internet, before anything, before,
3896000	3898000	I went out and every time I could I see it and then I would,
3898000	3902000	and I got, I somehow, I met his brother and I got a copy of the script
3902000	3905000	and I read the script and I outlined the script
3905000	3908000	and that was my, that was kind of before I read Robocop.
3908000	3911000	I had this whole obsession with Chinatown and Clockwork Orange.
3911000	3913000	I got the script for Clockwork Orange.
3913000	3916000	And sometimes if you look at it, you see, wow,
3916000	3918000	there's a circular structure in Clockwork Orange
3918000	3921000	and there's a circular, interesting structure, somebody pointed out on that.
3921000	3923000	So I don't know how that happened, but I think it was,
3923000	3926000	the things I was interested in were made their way in.
3926000	3929000	It's interesting to me because the Syd Field obsesses about
3930000	3933000	body heat and Chinatown.
3935000	3939000	And so that's why partly like, I'm like, God damn it.
3939000	3941000	Like, what about Robocop?
3941000	3944000	What about Die Hard because I'm of a slightly, maybe a half generation.
3944000	3947000	No, Die Hard is also a movie you can't stop watching.
3947000	3948000	There's something about it.
3948000	3952000	But it's funny that you're one of these craftsmen between,
3952000	3955000	you're watching Robert Towne's work and you're deconstructing it.
3955000	3958000	You're learning to program, you're needing,
3958000	3961000	you're wanting to peel that onion and figure out how to do it.
3961000	3963000	For some reason, I wanted to be the screenwriter.
3963000	3965000	Were you a big Western fan?
3965000	3967000	Yeah, no, I liked Westerns.
3967000	3972000	We used to always talk about, okay, we had John Wayne rules,
3972000	3975000	like, that ran what Robocop could do and what he couldn't do.
3975000	3977000	We were always aware of those kind of things.
3977000	3979000	Yeah, because that's, I mean, the prime directive,
3979000	3984000	like, Westerns as a genre, there's a set of, it was a code.
3984000	3985000	It was a code, you know.
3985000	3987000	A code of ethics, a code of morality,
3987000	3991000	whether you're Glenn Ford or Gary Cooper or Clint Eastwood or John Wayne.
3991000	3993000	There's things, there's do's and don'ts.
3993000	3996000	And you are punished for having that code.
3996000	3999000	The code is what puts you in peril.
3999000	4001000	The bad guys don't have a code.
4001000	4003000	Their code is do what you want.
4003000	4006000	So there's a real fantasy fulfillment when he is killed,
4006000	4009000	essentially because he's a cop and he gets killed
4009000	4011000	and he comes back as Robocop.
4011000	4013000	He gets to, you can shoot him now.
4013000	4016000	And that's really what makes that character cool.
4016000	4022000	You're in his High Plains Drifter because he's either a savior or he's Satan.
4022000	4027000	He's come back to either punish the town or save the town and both at the same times.
4027000	4030000	And he is, you don't know until the very end what exactly he is,
4030000	4033000	but he's never given a name, but he was.
4033000	4035000	Was he the brother or was he a ghost?
4035000	4037000	No, he was the sheriff that killed in the beginning.
4037000	4039000	Yeah, that's kind of Robocop, isn't it?
4039000	4042000	Well, I think those were things, those were movies of my youth.
4042000	4048000	Yeah, but he has this kind of invulnerability, not that he's bulletproof,
4048000	4054000	but he's got, like he comes from, he's also pure.
4054000	4056000	And that's the other thing you like about him.
4056000	4062000	He's actually a pre-sexual character and he's pure and he's not in any way diminished
4062000	4064000	and he really believes in justice.
4064000	4067000	And there's something that's really, people like that.
4067000	4068000	Yeah.
4068000	4071000	And it reflects in the relationship with Nancy Allen, which is not sexualized.
4071000	4072000	Right.
4072000	4077000	But when she sees him spin the gun and I'll still get choked up about that
4077000	4079000	because like, that's such a good fucking.
4079000	4080000	Oh yeah.
4080000	4081000	That relationship with Nancy Allen.
4081000	4082000	Yeah, it's worth noting.
4082000	4087000	It's 1987 for anything to hold up that was made in 1987.
4087000	4090000	I say this very cynically as a person is just like, look, come on.
4090000	4092000	Revenge of the nerds is amazing.
4092000	4096000	It's a tragedy that culture moves so fast that some of these movies that are so influential
4096000	4100000	and great, they just end up having so many cultural problem points
4100000	4105000	because this is how people, you know, it's like, oh, if you had telekinesis back then,
4105000	4106000	you popped a girl's bra off.
4106000	4108000	And like, it would have been.
4108000	4109000	Weird science.
4109000	4118000	You were, it's, Robocop does not have, you, it doesn't, it doesn't,
4118000	4122000	it doesn't, it doesn't throb with the problematizable.
4122000	4123000	Right.
4123000	4126000	No, no, it's because, by the way, I was an executive on weird science
4126000	4127000	when it was in script form.
4127000	4130000	And I thought it was, I just watched that recently.
4130000	4131000	And boy, that doesn't really hold up.
4131000	4136000	I think the reason that is because I grew up in Marin County,
4136000	4139000	which is a very, very neoliberal place.
4139000	4142000	And it was very granola in the days that I grew up there.
4142000	4146000	And my mother was the title nine officer at Redwood High School.
4146000	4149000	And she was part of an early sort of a feminist movement there.
4149000	4152000	And so I was sort of steeped in that.
4152000	4155000	My mother had, you know, one night, Gloria Steinem showed up at the house.
4155000	4159000	And when I was 13, so I think all of that had an effect on me in a way
4159000	4165000	that I really did want to create a role with Lewis that was just a role for a cop.
4165000	4166000	Yeah.
4166000	4167000	It wasn't about anything else.
4167000	4168000	I love that.
4168000	4170000	And sometimes it's as easy as what you don't do.
4170000	4171000	Restraint.
4171000	4173000	So in casting, we couldn't cast it.
4173000	4175000	And we had all this problem casting it.
4175000	4179000	And we kept looking at, and Verhoeven really understood this too at some level.
4179000	4182000	And again, if you look at his movies, you can see why.
4182000	4184000	But we kept looking at women, and they would come in.
4184000	4186000	All these beautiful women came in.
4186000	4189000	And whenever you imagine them with him, it became this kind of thing.
4189000	4192000	She's going to try to rub her hands on the chassis of his chest.
4192000	4193000	Yeah, he sexualizes it somehow.
4193000	4199000	And so one day, Paul said, yeah, I keep seeing the poster of Annie.
4199000	4202000	I think she should look like the girl from Annie.
4202000	4203000	And then Nancy Allen walked in.
4203000	4206000	So there's this kind of like trope.
4206000	4209000	She's feminine, but she's not sexual.
4209000	4210000	And she's kind of tough.
4210000	4212000	And she has a legacy as a victim in movies.
4212000	4213000	She's a scream queen.
4213000	4216000	Yeah, she really likes this movie because it's not that right.
4216000	4217000	Well, that's what it is.
4217000	4219000	She's reborn in this movie.
4219000	4225000	And it was also so immediately notable.
4225000	4228000	I thought this was just such brilliant futurism in your movie
4228000	4231000	that in the locker room scenes, they're co-ed.
4231000	4236000	And as a 15-year-old in 1987, it made perfect sense.
4236000	4237000	It cost no money.
4237000	4239000	There's no production value put into it.
4239000	4240000	It just goes by real fast.
4240000	4241000	There it is.
4241000	4242000	We're in the future.
4242000	4243000	Why?
4243000	4244000	The men and the women, yeah, of course.
4244000	4245000	Eventually, we're going to stop with this.
4245000	4249000	Eventually, 10 years later, we did the shower scene in Starship,
4249000	4250000	for the same reason.
4250000	4251000	Yeah.
4251000	4254000	When you got the budget, was it more than you dreamed of
4254000	4255000	or way less than you hoped for?
4255000	4256000	For Robocop?
4256000	4257000	Yeah.
4257000	4259000	Well, the movie almost didn't get made a couple times.
4259000	4263000	It was supposed to be 7.6 because that's what Terminator had cost.
4263000	4265000	And they were going to spend a dollar more.
4265000	4267000	And then one day, we came into the office,
4267000	4268000	and everybody's gone home.
4268000	4269000	And it was over.
4269000	4272000	And then they turned around, and they found some more money
4272000	4274000	because they found some money in Japan
4274000	4278000	because Peter Weller had done Buckaroo Banzai.
4278000	4279000	And they were interested in people.
4279000	4280000	Ah, yeah.
4280000	4282000	So suddenly, we were on again.
4282000	4286000	And we went in at like $10 million or something.
4286000	4289000	And then we immediately had trouble.
4289000	4292000	And the final cost of the movie was $13.9,
4292000	4294000	which is actually an amazing budget for that.
4294000	4295000	Wow.
4295000	4296000	It would be about $28.
4297000	4299000	Normally, Blue Thunder was a movie that was made during that time
4299000	4300000	as an action picture.
4300000	4302000	And that was $28 at the time.
4302000	4303000	So John Davison, great place.
4303000	4304000	Blue Thunder was $28 million.
4304000	4305000	That's so sad.
4305000	4310000	It's superpower was not making noise.
4310000	4312000	It was a super helicopter.
4312000	4315000	If it wanted, you could turn the volume down on it.
4315000	4316000	That's right.
4316000	4319000	But boy, did it play with Roy Scheider's alcoholism.
4319000	4320000	I liked Blue Thunder.
4320000	4321000	Sorry.
4321000	4324000	You're like, my uncle wrote that.
4325000	4328000	And it made, what, $50 million?
4328000	4329000	Which Robocop?
4329000	4330000	Yeah.
4330000	4333000	It was made $54 million, which in those days was a hit.
4333000	4334000	Yeah.
4334000	4335000	With the sleeper hit of the summer.
4335000	4336000	So then you're a made man.
4336000	4342000	I kind of want to talk about the two jakes of Robocop 2,
4342000	4344000	only because historically, it's so interesting.
4344000	4345000	I was reading the Wikipedia.
4345000	4348000	And I was like, oh, God, what a Forrest Gumpy kind of thing
4348000	4353000	that Robocop 2 is an interesting sequel.
4353000	4356000	You definitely, even if you don't read a single credit,
4356000	4358000	you're kind of like, what's going on here?
4358000	4363000	And they went to Frank Miller to write the script
4363000	4367000	because it was 1988 and the WGA strike.
4367000	4368000	It was a WGA strike.
4368000	4371000	And you had a script in the chamber.
4371000	4373000	You got another Neumire coming out.
4373000	4374000	Oh, you did?
4374000	4375000	You had written one?
4375000	4376000	Well, okay.
4376000	4379000	So when the movie came out and we were made, as you said,
4379000	4382000	they said, okay, you have to write a new Robocop immediately
4382000	4383000	or you're fired.
4383000	4386000	They literally said, if you don't immediately write a new story,
4386000	4387000	we can fire you.
4387000	4389000	And so we said, okay.
4389000	4391000	And then Oliver Stone wanted us to write a script.
4391000	4396000	And so called about the CIA in Nicaragua.
4396000	4397000	And that was kind of sexy.
4397000	4399000	And they sent us down to Nicaragua.
4399000	4401000	You get to work with Jim Belushi.
4401000	4402000	We got to run around with Sandinistas.
4402000	4404000	It was really groovy.
4404000	4407000	And he had just done Platoon, so he was the man.
4407000	4410000	So we wrote two scripts at the same time, which is a mistake.
4410000	4411000	And we did it in three months.
4411000	4413000	And one script turned out better than the other.
4413000	4416000	And the Robocop script that we had written right before the strike
4416000	4417000	was okay.
4417000	4418000	So you wrote Salvador?
4418000	4419000	No.
4419000	4422000	We wrote a thing called Company Man right after Platoon.
4422000	4427000	And it was about Nicaragua, not where Salvador was.
4427000	4428000	That's probably Salvador.
4428000	4429000	Yeah.
4429000	4430000	This was about the Sandinistas.
4430000	4432000	And we had to go down and do all that.
4432000	4433000	It was kind of a fun script.
4433000	4434000	But Oliver didn't make it.
4434000	4436000	And then we got fired because there was a writer's strike.
4436000	4439000	And they signed a waiver and hired Frank Miller,
4439000	4441000	who I had introduced to John Davis.
4441000	4442000	This is a really cool guy.
4442000	4443000	I don't really know him.
4443000	4445000	So Frank did that script.
4445000	4448000	He did one script, which they rejected.
4448000	4451000	And then they brought in Waylon Green, who wrote The Wild Bunch.
4451000	4452000	And they did a second script.
4452000	4453000	Wow.
4453000	4455000	And it was kind of based on the creature.
4455000	4458000	In some ways, I believe it was based on the creature that Phil Tippett
4458000	4459000	was going to do for it.
4459000	4462000	Because John and Phil really had this idea.
4462000	4463000	And I don't love the movie.
4463000	4467000	But the drug dealer kid is something I feel I could redeem
4468000	4469000	if I had been writing it.
4469000	4470000	Yeah.
4470000	4471000	Well, OK.
4471000	4472000	That was a roller coaster sentence.
4472000	4475000	Because I was like, one thing I fucking hate about that movie
4475000	4477000	is that obnoxious ventriloquist dummy kid.
4477000	4478000	No, I know.
4478000	4479000	But there's something the idea of it is cool.
4479000	4480000	But you're absolutely right.
4480000	4481000	Yes.
4481000	4483000	The things you could have done with that kid.
4483000	4485000	I don't remember anything about Robocop 2.
4485000	4486000	Because I hated it.
4486000	4489000	And nothing sticks to my brain about that movie.
4489000	4491000	The thing that sticks to my brain that reminds me of something
4491000	4494000	that you could have done a lot with,
4494000	4497000	I thought it was a great, wonderful idea
4497000	4500000	that the tragedy of the Robocop story and Robocop 2
4500000	4504000	is that the prime directives go up for committee.
4504000	4507000	And he ends up with 109 directives.
4507000	4510000	Like, it won't kill you to smile now and then.
4510000	4512000	And kind of like, it's just sort of like,
4512000	4514000	Robocop becomes this schizophrenic.
4514000	4515000	I don't know if it's true.
4515000	4517000	But I bet you that's a John Davison idea.
4517000	4519000	Because that's really what John, that would have been an idea.
4519000	4521000	Director number four was, don't sweat the little shit.
4521000	4522000	Right.
4523000	4526000	It's absurd and realistic.
4526000	4528000	It's resonant, the idea of like, oh god,
4528000	4530000	this would be the thing that would kill Robocop.
4530000	4533000	He would end up having all these directives.
4538000	4540000	If it wasn't called Robocop, it might even
4540000	4542000	be a cult favorite of mine.
4542000	4546000	Because it would be this weird comic booky, cyberpunky movie
4546000	4548000	with Tom Noonan as this crackhead
4548000	4551000	that turns into a crackhead robot.
4552000	4555000	But as a Robocop sequel, boy, how could you?
4555000	4558000	It's got to make you feel kind of good
4558000	4563000	that nobody can make it work.
4563000	4566000	Because there's been so many different interpretations.
4566000	4568000	When you drop swords, they just merge with stones
4568000	4570000	when you walk away.
4570000	4574000	They can make a Robocop remake, a TV series.
4574000	4577000	Well, I hope they'll get it right one of these days.
4577000	4579000	MGM wants to make another one, and we're trying to help.
4579000	4580000	But we'll see.
4580000	4585000	Yeah, so there was this reboot in 2014, which I didn't watch.
4585000	4587000	And I'm not usually a snob about reboots,
4587000	4589000	but this is too personal for me.
4589000	4591000	I knew there was absolutely no way.
4591000	4594000	I saw the suit, and I got on.
4594000	4595000	What the fuck?
4595000	4596000	I mean, give me a break.
4596000	4598000	Again, I'll watch.
4598000	4601000	I never seen Rob that personally just wounded.
4601000	4602000	I'm just so pissed off.
4602000	4604000	I mean, because it's just like somebody went,
4604000	4606000	no, I think we can do better.
4606000	4608000	And that's what they come up with.
4609000	4612000	Seriously, get out.
4612000	4613000	Get out of here.
4613000	4614000	The arrogance is astounding.
4614000	4615000	Take that shit out of here.
4615000	4619000	Especially when even for your time,
4619000	4624000	it was already a confident bet.
4624000	4630000	It wasn't like all the rage was guys in ridiculous tin man
4630000	4632000	costumes that looked like tanks.
4632000	4635000	It wasn't like, oh, you just rode those coattails.
4635000	4638000	It was like it had already been established that if you just
4638000	4642000	trust this singular tone and let it be its own thing,
4642000	4643000	and then for them to go like, yeah,
4643000	4645000	but everything's black and rubber now.
4645000	4646000	It's hot.
4646000	4650000	But I don't want to bag on that stuff and shake my cane at it.
4650000	4652000	But it's important to note.
4652000	4653000	So you got Robocop.
4653000	4654000	You got Robocop 2.
4654000	4657000	You got Robocop 3, where I think there's like ninjas in that one
4657000	4659000	and a jet pack.
4659000	4660000	There's been a cartoon.
4660000	4663000	There's been all kinds of stuff.
4664000	4666000	And then there's the reboot, which I didn't watch.
4666000	4668000	There was a Canadian TV series?
4668000	4669000	Canonically.
4669000	4670000	Prime Directive.
4670000	4674000	Now, I don't know what stage they're at.
4674000	4675000	You can fill us in on the details.
4675000	4682000	But they're going to do a sequel to the original that
4682000	4685000	ignores all of this other stuff.
4685000	4688000	Well, we'll see what's going to happen.
4688000	4690000	But I have to say that MGM has been very,
4690000	4692000	very nice to me since the reboot.
4693000	4697000	When I got credited because of the WGA,
4697000	4699000	I had to go in and meet with them.
4699000	4701000	And I met with the president of MGM.
4701000	4706000	And you'll see online, it's like Ed's got a credit on the 2014
4706000	4711000	Robocop reboot, which Mike Rowe broke a little part of my heart
4711000	4712000	for a second.
4712000	4714000	Well, it had nothing to do with it.
4714000	4715000	Right.
4715000	4717000	It was sort of nice to get the residuals.
4717000	4719000	And it's because, just to clarify,
4719000	4725000	it's because the writers, in basing it on your characters
4725000	4729000	and your story, they evoked enough of it that arbitration.
4729000	4732000	They took so many pieces of it and used it
4732000	4734000	in the arbitration process.
4734000	4736000	They assigned us a fair amount of credit for it.
4736000	4739000	Now, I feel like that's got to feel good.
4739000	4743000	Because that's not even like the, like it's maybe
4743000	4745000	like a 15-year-old boy fantasy to be like,
4745000	4748000	yeah, and then they did it without me and it sucked.
4749000	4756000	But that's a proper mentor wizard fantasy of like,
4756000	4760000	it's been 30 years and these kids are trying your craft.
4760000	4763000	And the blood magic gets out of control.
4763000	4767000	And you're just like, yeah, you're sitting there
4767000	4769000	and you're a lazy boy and you're like,
4769000	4770000	oh, I felt a tingle.
4770000	4774000	Someone's trying to do what I did again.
4774000	4777000	They always think they're always sure
4777000	4778000	that what they're doing is the right thing.
4778000	4781000	Do you feel like maybe you can't or can't talk about
4781000	4785000	what stage this new possible straight sequel thing is,
4785000	4787000	but do you feel confident if you went back
4787000	4790000	and tried to do the sequel that you have,
4790000	4793000	like you know where you're going with that
4793000	4795000	and you could pull it off?
4795000	4797000	We've had a bunch of conversations about this.
4797000	4799000	What happened, which was interesting,
4799000	4802000	was I went in when I met them, they'd all just finished
4802000	4804000	this movie and hadn't come out yet.
4804000	4806000	And I had a kind of, it was kind of a weird like,
4806000	4808000	how did I feel about this?
4808000	4809000	They were remaking this movie.
4809000	4810000	I was meeting all those people.
4810000	4812000	But I remembered having made a couple movies
4812000	4815000	that were traumatic that they were all probably in shock
4815000	4817000	and that it had been a very difficult experience
4817000	4819000	and it really had been.
4819000	4822000	And so I decided to just interview them about that.
4822000	4824000	And I interviewed everyone I could.
4824000	4827000	I interviewed the writer that we got credit from.
4827000	4829000	I interviewed the president.
4829000	4830000	I interviewed the director.
4830000	4831000	And I would just sit there and say,
4831000	4833000	well, what was that like and how did that happen?
4833000	4836000	And they sort of remembered that somehow.
4836000	4838000	And when the movie came out and didn't do that well,
4838000	4840000	I got a call from the president of production saying,
4840000	4842000	why don't you come in here and tell us
4842000	4844000	any Robocop ideas you have?
4844000	4846000	And I went in and I said, well, you know,
4846000	4848000	there was, I started telling him this idea I had.
4848000	4850000	And he said, are you pitching me the original sequel
4850000	4853000	that you guys wrote back in 1988?
4853000	4855000	And I said, well, yeah, kind of.
4855000	4857000	And he said, oh, okay.
4857000	4860000	And that sort of has set us off in a different direction.
4860000	4862000	Oh, fuck yeah.
4862000	4864000	So we'll see.
4864000	4866000	Are you kidding me?
4866000	4867000	No, but we'll see.
4867000	4868000	There's a lot of work to be done.
4868000	4870000	And then Neil Blumkamp came swooping in
4870000	4872000	when he heard they were going to do it.
4872000	4873000	Look at Rob.
4873000	4875000	He was going to do it for a while.
4875000	4877000	Oh, he's not.
4877000	4880000	He said, well, there's one funny story.
4880000	4882000	But then it didn't work out.
4882000	4884000	They developed a few scripts.
4884000	4886000	And he had a bunch of different ideas.
4886000	4889000	And I don't think it ever really came together.
4889000	4891000	But at one point he decided, and I thought this was interesting.
4891000	4893000	He said, we really got to go and do it
4893000	4895000	like it happened right after the first one.
4895000	4897000	That it was Verhoeven's next movie.
4897000	4898000	Verhoeven.
4898000	4901000	He said, I'm going to do it just like Paul Verhoeven.
4901000	4903000	So the other day I'm sitting with Paul Verhoeven.
4903000	4906000	He said, yeah, he said he was going to do it
4906000	4908000	just like Paul Verhoeven.
4908000	4909000	I can't quite do Paul's voice.
4909000	4910000	It sounds better.
4910000	4912000	And he said, but he said, I can't do it
4912000	4914000	like Paul Verhoeven anymore.
4914000	4916000	He said, because I won't have the same set
4916000	4918000	of circumstances creatively.
4918000	4921000	I'm not trying to make a movie for $10 million.
4921000	4922000	I don't have John Davison.
4922000	4923000	I don't have Phil Tippett then.
4923000	4924000	I don't have you.
4924000	4926000	I don't have all these people together.
4926000	4929000	And for him, that's as much a part of the creative thing
4929000	4931000	in that moment as anything else.
4931000	4936000	Yeah, because that movie does kind of feel like,
4936000	4940000	and Die Hard 2, that's more of a larger production maybe.
4940000	4941000	I don't know.
4941000	4944000	But they feel like B movies that were done perfectly.
4944000	4948000	And they kind of feel like they were made in secrets.
4948000	4950000	They were made for you.
4950000	4954000	When you walk into the theater, we turned over a rock
4954000	4955000	and found a diamond.
4955000	4957000	It's not like you go in there and it's
4957000	4959000	a giant tentpole kind of thing.
4959000	4961000	Well, they're not shoving it down your throat, is what you're talking about.
4961000	4962000	Yeah, exactly.
4962000	4966000	So the Robocop, I feel a personal relationship with that
4966000	4969000	in a way that I don't feel with ET or things like that
4969000	4972000	that are just these giant juggernaut kind of things.
4972000	4974000	I think that might have something to do with just,
4974000	4976000	not to sound like an old cane shaker,
4976000	4979000	but I think it just has to do with the singularity
4979000	4981000	that hasn't happened yet, which is CG.
4981000	4986000	When CG starts to happen, the vastness of your world
4986000	4989000	is not related in any way to your budget.
4989000	4992000	If Cronenberg wants to reboot The Fly,
4992000	4995000	he has to rent a warehouse.
4995000	4997000	He has to build telepods.
4997000	5000000	And these characters, these Rick Bakers, these Phil Tippetts,
5000000	5003000	these craftsmen have to come in and figure out
5003000	5007000	how to make a beetle into a person and vice versa.
5007000	5012000	And there's a relationship there between budget, scope,
5012000	5017000	but more importantly, oh, if this guy's going to become a fly in this movie,
5017000	5020000	then it's all the more important that we understand
5020000	5023000	that he's a human being because of the budget,
5023000	5027000	because of the practicality of the makeup and everything.
5027000	5031000	You can't waste anyone's time here on an emotional level.
5031000	5033000	And then you start to get into like,
5033000	5035000	okay, you're going to show up at Warner Brothers.
5035000	5038000	There's going to be a 90-foot sheet of green.
5038000	5042000	You're not going to be in a scene with any other actor.
5042000	5044000	We just need your head.
5044000	5047000	We're going to scan it from 360 degrees.
5047000	5052000	Sign this form that says if you die, you can be a cracker.
5052000	5055000	And congratulations, because the computer says you already
5055000	5058000	paid $100 billion in Hong Kong and I go goodbye.
5058000	5063000	And then it's like we've made some amazing movies with this technology,
5063000	5070000	but what we've also done is we've lost that middle class.
5070000	5072000	I don't know what to call it.
5072000	5075000	Well, Verhoeven always would say that reality is the best special effect
5075000	5078000	and that reality is what makes these things work.
5078000	5080000	And even in a story level, he would go, I don't like that.
5080000	5082000	It's not real. It's not how it would happen.
5082000	5086000	Even if you're talking about absurd things like robots and law enforcement
5086000	5087000	and stuff like that.
5087000	5090000	And also, you really feel it like you feel the reality of a man in a suit.
5090000	5093000	The performance is because of that suit.
5093000	5094000	Oh, let's talk about that a little bit.
5094000	5095000	Sure.
5095000	5096000	Dr. Weller, Ph.D.
5096000	5101000	So I always assumed, and this is incredibly easy to assume,
5101000	5104000	and I'm so intrigued that the answer is not exactly,
5104000	5108000	that when you watch Robocop, because I didn't,
5108000	5110000	I was like, who was Peter Weller?
5110000	5112000	Turns out, Buckaroo Banzai, right.
5112000	5113000	Okay.
5113000	5116000	But I watched that movie and I was like, who's this guy?
5116000	5121000	Oh, they must have cast him for those weird kissy lips.
5121000	5124000	His almost feminine jawline.
5124000	5128000	Because they knew that they were committing this cardinal sin,
5128000	5131000	that they were going to be casting this actor with no,
5131000	5135000	this character was going to have no eyes, no nose, no ears.
5135000	5137000	And it was so important.
5137000	5139000	You're like these auditions where these actors are coming in
5139000	5142000	and standing under a sheet that's on C-stands.
5142000	5144000	The only thing visible is their lips
5144000	5147000	and that Peter Weller walked away with the part.
5147000	5148000	Not the case at all.
5148000	5149000	He was Buckaroo Banzai.
5149000	5153000	Well, it really helps that Peter was really thin.
5153000	5155000	That helps a lot when you're building a suit like that.
5155000	5157000	And so if you put the wrong person in the suit,
5157000	5159000	you're going to get the Michelin man.
5159000	5164000	But he also has this kind of perfect look of,
5164000	5167000	I used to say when I was being meaner,
5167000	5172000	but he has this kind of tragic look of mythic self-pity or something.
5172000	5176000	But there's a tragedy about his face that really works well in that.
5176000	5178000	He's got those kissy lips.
5178000	5183000	I always thought you needed a real actor in the park.
5183000	5186000	We went out to a bunch of different people who came in.
5186000	5188000	Keith Carradine wanted to do it.
5188000	5192000	Robert Carradine, no, David Carradine really wanted to do it.
5192000	5194000	And so he had all those kind of things.
5194000	5197000	But it came down to, I think...
5197000	5199000	There's a great SNL sketch here, obviously.
5199000	5200000	Just a bunch of...
5200000	5201000	Oh, we mean it all the different...
5201000	5202000	Yeah, Jack Lennon and the Robocop.
5202000	5203000	Peter finally came.
5203000	5204000	Peter was somebody that...
5204000	5205000	Walter Matthau.
5205000	5207000	We knew he was a good actor.
5207000	5212000	Orion liked him because Buckaroo Banzai had made some money in Japan.
5212000	5213000	And he came in.
5213000	5216000	He wouldn't read on tape, so he read with me.
5216000	5219000	He says he didn't read, but he actually had to read with me.
5219000	5221000	And it was actually kind of scary.
5221000	5223000	Paul said, okay, that's good.
5223000	5224000	We'll go with him.
5224000	5229000	And then he went out and trained with a mime coach, Moni Yakim,
5229000	5232000	for a long time in hockey gear in Central Park,
5232000	5234000	trying to get all these moves.
5234000	5235000	That's so cool.
5235000	5238000	It's so important that his movements are so...
5238000	5239000	Did anybody ask him to do that?
5239000	5242000	And he says, and of course, now you will start acting like a man.
5242000	5243000	I think he wanted to do that.
5243000	5244000	He knew that was an issue.
5244000	5246000	John Davison, everybody knew that was a good idea.
5246000	5248000	So in the meantime...
5248000	5250000	Because he does a little neck...
5250000	5251000	Yeah, so good.
5251000	5254000	Well, the suit is being made, and it's being made.
5254000	5257000	And then the suit is a week late in production,
5257000	5260000	which really causes a lot of trouble, but it's for good reasons.
5260000	5263000	Come quietly, or there will be trouble.
5263000	5266000	And so when Peter is thrown into that suit for the first time,
5266000	5269000	it's a huge crisis in the production
5269000	5271000	because he's never been in the suit before.
5271000	5274000	And even though there's been all this prep and all this stuff,
5274000	5277000	now you've got to make the character work.
5277000	5280000	And it was a really bad weekend.
5280000	5283000	And it was sort of a cauldron.
5283000	5287000	And out of that bad, bad weekend came this suit movements.
5287000	5290000	All the stuff he'd done before, now he's working with Paul.
5290000	5291000	And that's how...
5291000	5294000	It was like he was born under huge pressure.
5294000	5297000	Well, I want to make sure I'm clear on what you're saying.
5297000	5299000	You're saying there was this sort of travesty...
5299000	5301000	It almost sounds like the Jaws story of the Sharks not working.
5301000	5303000	No, there wasn't anything wrong with the suit.
5303000	5304000	It just came in at the last minute.
5304000	5306000	It was more complicated than everybody did.
5306000	5309000	And was his work with the Mime people as a result
5309000	5311000	of the awkwardness of the suit being laid?
5311000	5314000	He had never really been in the suit before.
5314000	5317000	And then the suit came on to the set later than it was supposed to.
5317000	5318000	So there was a lot of pressure.
5318000	5319000	Like, let's suit it tomorrow.
5319000	5320000	Right.
5320000	5322000	And in those days when you had a suit,
5322000	5325000	the first time you put it on, it took 14 hours.
5325000	5327000	So the first day he shot maybe an hour.
5327000	5328000	14 hours?
5328000	5330000	And then by the time they got it right,
5330000	5332000	it was much quicker in it all.
5332000	5333000	But it was a big deal.
5333000	5334000	But it was somehow...
5334000	5336000	Everybody at the time, we almost...
5336000	5337000	We had other problems.
5337000	5339000	We almost got shut down at the production company.
5339000	5341000	A production guarantee came in.
5341000	5343000	And for a moment it looked really bad.
5343000	5346000	And it was under this kind of pressurized situation
5346000	5349000	at the beginning of the movie that the suit came in
5349000	5350000	and he had to get in it.
5350000	5352000	And it was where the character was born.
5352000	5354000	This is something that can't be discounted
5354000	5356000	because at the time, although there's no CG,
5356000	5358000	there is something that absolutely makes
5358000	5361000	all of what you're doing on this set
5362000	5364000	so potentially disastrous.
5364000	5365000	It didn't work.
5365000	5366000	It wasn't going to work.
5366000	5368000	That was the entire moment right there.
5368000	5369000	Everything else was working.
5369000	5371000	But if that didn't come together,
5371000	5374000	if you didn't buy Peter in the suit as Robocop,
5374000	5375000	then that was it.
5375000	5379000	Anybody that knows their 1980s popcorn movie,
5379000	5382000	you mentioned a movie from 1986 that you were so...
5382000	5383000	Oh, Short Circuit.
5383000	5384000	Yeah.
5384000	5385000	And I was like,
5385000	5387000	Oh God, I never thought about Short Circuit
5387000	5388000	in relation to Robocop.
5388000	5390000	And it was your nightmare because it was like,
5390000	5391000	that's how you do it.
5391000	5393000	They were going to beat us into the theaters.
5393000	5396000	It was like, that's what a robot was in that day.
5396000	5400000	No CG yet, but absolutely armatures erector set.
5400000	5402000	I am a remote control.
5402000	5404000	E.T. is a robot, essentially.
5404000	5405000	And I was really relieved.
5405000	5406000	I was like, Oh, thank God.
5406000	5407000	This is so different from me.
5407000	5409000	The stupid question.
5409000	5411000	The gun holster that comes out of his leg,
5411000	5413000	was that a practical effect or was that stop motion?
5413000	5416000	That was a practical effect that it was a leg
5416000	5417000	that Robertin made.
5417000	5419000	And Robertin, here's how good Robertin is.
5419000	5421000	Robertin just made that.
5421000	5422000	What?
5422000	5423000	We didn't talk to him about it.
5423000	5425000	He just said, Oh no, it has to be this way.
5425000	5426000	And he just made that.
5426000	5427000	He just myth-bustered it and said,
5427000	5428000	fuck it.
5428000	5429000	The thing comes out and the thing...
5429000	5431000	Of the many, many, many...
5431000	5433000	I kind of want to talk about Foley.
5433000	5434000	I want to talk about a loop group.
5434000	5437000	Because it's like, I wonder, is it a loop group line
5437000	5439000	where there's like in that firing squad thing
5439000	5442000	where, okay, so, you know,
5442000	5444000	everyone's just shooting on the firing line
5444000	5447000	and then slowly the sound of this weird gun.
5448000	5450000	And then everyone's like running.
5450000	5452000	Verhoeven's doing this thing,
5452000	5454000	the camera's going, everyone's like running.
5454000	5456000	And then there's like,
5456000	5458000	this one voice rings out,
5458000	5461000	there's this guy going, look at that fucking gun.
5463000	5464000	I meant to bring it to you.
5464000	5465000	I'll bring you the script.
5465000	5466000	It's in the script.
5466000	5468000	It's in the script.
5468000	5473000	The cop's reaction to Robocop is so important
5473000	5476000	because, again,
5476000	5480000	they do say while they're running
5480000	5483000	and they're separated by chain link,
5483000	5485000	they're watching this robot who, by the way,
5485000	5488000	is being meticulously revealed.
5488000	5490000	That was Verhoeven's really, really big point.
5490000	5492000	Verhoeven, I remember from the commentary,
5492000	5494000	the brilliant idea of the first time you see him
5494000	5496000	is essentially on video assists.
5496000	5497000	Right, he walks by.
5497000	5501000	And it's so smart because it goes in subjective.
5501000	5506000	The transformation where you go into death itself
5506000	5508000	and then the only thing you're conscious of
5508000	5511000	is the reassembly of your life,
5511000	5513000	you the audience,
5513000	5517000	including a weird female executive in a pencil skirt
5517000	5519000	who is not a character in the film
5519000	5522000	but is a character in your formative life
5522000	5525000	who made out with you drunk at a New Year's Eve party.
5525000	5526000	Oh.
5526000	5527000	But that's the...
5527000	5528000	You mean Tyler.
5528000	5529000	Yeah, yeah.
5529000	5531000	Yeah, I'm saying she's not in the movie.
5531000	5532000	She doesn't have an arc.
5532000	5533000	No, she is.
5533000	5534000	She is actually the...
5534000	5535000	Well, she didn't have an arc.
5535000	5537000	I know I'm saying she has a story
5537000	5539000	only within Robocop's nursery.
5539000	5540000	Right.
5540000	5541000	It's so ancient Greek.
5541000	5543000	It's like we don't have to carry her.
5543000	5546000	We didn't have to figure out how she's related
5546000	5547000	to this and that,
5547000	5549000	when Dick Jones gets fired and goes,
5549000	5550000	can I be promoted?
5550000	5554000	It's like her job, mythically,
5554000	5557000	is that she is this Athena that is there.
5558000	5561000	The addition of this idea that during this assembly
5561000	5563000	of what you're becoming Robocop
5563000	5565000	and so you don't know how much time is passing
5565000	5566000	and then...
5568000	5570000	And the targeting systems are like,
5570000	5571000	all right, no, hold it.
5571000	5572000	Step up.
5572000	5573000	Ah, shit.
5573000	5575000	And you're watching them.
5575000	5576000	And then...
5576000	5577000	And it comes to life
5577000	5581000	and you hear in the distance music party favors
5581000	5584000	and this drunk version of this woman
5584000	5587000	who has smugly crushed Miguel Ferrer's hand
5587000	5588000	with the prosthesis
5588000	5591000	and she just comes into the...
5591000	5593000	She sneaks over to the camera
5593000	5595000	and puts a big lipstick kiss on it.
5595000	5596000	Sage Parker.
5596000	5598000	And that's an interesting scene
5598000	5600000	because that's the only ad-lib scene in the whole movie.
5600000	5604000	We were at the Mary Kay cosmetics company in Dallas,
5604000	5605000	which is where that shot.
5605000	5607000	And somebody, the prop person,
5607000	5611000	brought in a box of props for a New Year's Eve party
5611000	5612000	or something.
5612000	5613000	I don't know why they were there
5613000	5615000	and I said, oh, we have to use this crown
5615000	5617000	and we have to do this New Year's Eve party.
5617000	5618000	And I wrote it.
5618000	5619000	The only time I've ever done this,
5619000	5621000	I went into a room in Mary Kay places place
5621000	5623000	and I wrote this thing and they shot it.
5623000	5624000	And that was the scene.
5624000	5625000	So cool.
5625000	5626000	And that was really, the kiss was something
5626000	5628000	that was sort of ad-libbed on the side.
5628000	5630000	And so the cops, then, yeah,
5630000	5631000	I went off on several tangents there,
5631000	5634000	but the cops, even though the story is just mounting
5634000	5638000	and it's like, we're just not seeing all of Robocop yet
5638000	5641000	and now we're seeing enough of him
5642000	5643000	through the eyes of the cops.
5643000	5645000	And the cops are both one.
5645000	5648000	They can't get enough of seeing him.
5648000	5649000	They just want to see him.
5649000	5652000	But at the same time, they're absolutely aware.
5652000	5653000	And one of them says something like,
5653000	5654000	we're out of a job.
5654000	5655000	They're going to replace him.
5655000	5656000	We're out of a job.
5656000	5661000	It's like, you feel like if you're developing a movie
5661000	5663000	that somebody would have the note of like,
5663000	5665000	do the cops like Robocop or not?
5665000	5668000	It's just, I'm confused because you got them running
5668000	5670000	and it seems like they're big fans of Robocop,
5670000	5673000	but don't they want cops to be not Robocops?
5673000	5675000	We were really, John Davison really kept
5675000	5677000	some of those things away.
5677000	5679000	I mean, we had to deal with some notes,
5679000	5681000	but we didn't have to deal with too many of them.
5681000	5684000	And they kind of really let us bring them the script.
5684000	5686000	And I guess each time we brought them one,
5686000	5688000	we never had those notes,
5688000	5690000	or I don't remember any of those.
5690000	5693000	I also remember not taking too many of their notes.
5693000	5696000	I learned that you could ignore the bad ones.
5697000	5698000	Yeah.
5698000	5700000	I mean, they'll call you difficult,
5700000	5706000	but if you make $50 million, who's going to remember that?
5706000	5707000	So what did you prefer?
5707000	5709000	Because it seems like when you look at your filmography,
5709000	5713000	you seem more invested in the Starship Trooper franchise.
5713000	5715000	That seems like something that kind of...
5715000	5717000	No, I mean, they offered me...
5717000	5721000	I kept getting paid to write a Starship Trooper stuff.
5721000	5723000	And John Davison wanted to do...
5723000	5726000	John Davison always wanted to help Phil Tippett direct a movie.
5726000	5728000	So that was Starship 2.
5728000	5730000	And I came along to help him a little bit.
5730000	5733000	Are the bugs the good guys?
5735000	5737000	Not really.
5737000	5739000	I felt like the movie was saying, ha, ha.
5739000	5744000	The movie says maybe you have been rooting for the Nazis in the act...
5744000	5746000	Which is not something that when you say,
5746000	5749000	you talk about referencing these movies,
5749000	5752000	that's not an element of the movies
5752000	5755000	that you're referencing, the military movies that are selling war bugs.
5755000	5756000	Well, what do you mean?
5756000	5758000	The moral ambiguity of the...
5758000	5759000	Well, you never know.
5759000	5761000	What makes us so different from the Nazis?
5761000	5763000	That's not an element of those movies.
5763000	5764000	Of which movies?
5764000	5765000	Of the movies that you're...
5765000	5766000	No, no, you're right.
5766000	5768000	They're not of the American propaganda movies,
5768000	5771000	but we also looked at all the movies they were making too.
5771000	5773000	I mean, we were just trying to come...
5773000	5774000	The Nazis.
5774000	5775000	The Nazi propaganda.
5775000	5777000	Would you like to know more?
5777000	5779000	Well, there you go.
5779000	5780000	Yeah, those sequences are amazing.
5780000	5782000	Great narrative pieces.
5782000	5786000	Did you kind of meticulously write those?
5786000	5787000	Those are my favorite things.
5787000	5788000	Yeah.
5788000	5789000	Those are the things that I like for something.
5789000	5792000	I can imagine you agonizing over page by page,
5792000	5794000	where it's like, if you ever had...
5794000	5798000	If you ever have a moment when you're doing work that turned out to be great...
5798000	5801000	Spoilers, I need the answer to be yes.
5801000	5805000	Where it's like, you're not allowed to tell anybody what you've done
5805000	5808000	in the last six hours because the actual technical answer
5808000	5810000	is six lines of dialogue.
5810000	5812000	Well, that's my entire writing life.
5812000	5814000	All right. Thank you. God damn.
5814000	5817000	It takes me forever.
5817000	5820000	To answer your question a long time, there were five drafts of Robocop.
5820000	5821000	Okay.
5821000	5824000	If somebody gives me an email, I'll send you the production draft,
5824000	5825000	and you can...
5825000	5826000	I'll send you mine.
5826000	5834000	Oh, we should plug, by the way, your Creepshow series is coming out.
5834000	5835000	Creepshow.
5835000	5837000	Yeah.
5837000	5841000	Starts Thursday on Shutter,
5841000	5846000	and a first episode directed by Greg Nicotero.
5846000	5849000	It's based off of the Stephen King story, Grey Matter,
5849000	5852000	and second one is directed by George Harrison,
5852000	5855000	who worked on the original Creepshow,
5855000	5861000	and there's two installments per episode.
5861000	5865000	I'm in the second episode, so not this week, Thursday,
5865000	5869000	but the following Thursday is my episode.
5869000	5873000	And I think we have a special guest, Ed.
5873000	5878000	I didn't know that they were going to show up, but...
5878000	5881000	Ed Neumeier.
5881000	5886000	You have ten seconds to comply with my interview questions.
5886000	5887000	Whoo!
5887000	5889000	Oh, my gosh. This is...
5889000	5890000	I didn't even see...
5890000	5893000	Oh, my gosh. It's the Ed 209 Access Hollywood segment.
5893000	5898000	This little picture-in-picture swooping by of Ed 209
5898000	5901000	interviewing Tom Cruise and Mickey Rourke.
5901000	5904000	So did you two get along on set?
5904000	5907000	Uh, I will ask the questions.
5907000	5910000	Oh, sorry.
5910000	5913000	Ed Neumeier.
5913000	5917000	What is your purpose on this premises?
5917000	5921000	Sorry, I'm not really teeing you up.
5921000	5925000	I'm trying to figure out more what would Ed 209 ask,
5925000	5930000	and it's not really setting you up for success as a performer.
5930000	5932000	That's one of my pet peeves.
5932000	5934000	People ask a funny question,
5934000	5936000	and then you're supposed to go,
5936000	5941000	Yes?
5941000	5944000	I don't like it.
5944000	5945000	Yeah.
5945000	5947000	Guys, I'm in the production booth.
5947000	5950000	So do commercials. So do commercials.
5950000	5951000	We'll be right back.
5951000	5953000	Okay. Hey, Ed. Ed.
5953000	5954000	Yes?
5954000	5956000	What's going on over there?
5956000	5958000	Rawr!
5958000	5964000	I have been made extremely nervous by interviewing my own creator.
5964000	5967000	Okay. Well, I understand that,
5967000	5969000	but you have the three-by-five cards in front of you.
5969000	5973000	Just read the questions that we went over before he came in.
5973000	5976000	So now we're in Blade Runner.
5976000	5978000	All right. And we're back.
5978000	5982000	Oh, yes.
5982000	5988000	Ed Neumire.
5988000	5993000	What are stairs like?
5993000	5995000	Okay. Yeah, that was a thing.
5995000	5996000	They built the perfect robot.
5996000	5998000	Motherfucker can't get upstairs.
5998000	6000000	But that was absolutely brilliant.
6000000	6004000	That, to me, seems a little bit like Robert Zemeckis talked about
6004000	6007000	seven years of not being able to write past the point
6007000	6010000	and back to the future where he's got to either make out
6010000	6014000	with his mom in a car or the movie's over,
6014000	6017000	and that there was just years of,
6017000	6021000	boy, to the extent that the story tells itself,
6021000	6024000	we are in a box here.
6024000	6026000	America doesn't love incest yet.
6026000	6030000	Pornhub hasn't come out.
6030000	6033000	And then they just came up with the silliest thing,
6033000	6036000	which was she kisses him and she says,
6036000	6037000	it's like kissing my brother.
6037000	6040000	And it's like, you talk about the roar line of Murphy
6040000	6041000	and it's just like unpredictable.
6041000	6043000	People were like, oh, and I think what they're saying is,
6043000	6047000	thank you for getting us out of that Hellraiser incest box.
6047000	6050000	That's how I imagine the staircase.
6050000	6054000	I never thought the staircase gag was going to be as funny as it was.
6054000	6056000	I thought, I hoped it was good enough,
6056000	6058000	and then Phil Tippett made it work.
6058000	6060000	And I think it doesn't work without Phil.
6060000	6063000	I think it also think it works because it really doesn't occur to you.
6063000	6066000	I mean, Robocop goes to the skyscraper.
6066000	6069000	He walks to the CEO of this thing.
6069000	6070000	He goes, you're under arrest.
6070000	6073000	And the guy goes, ha, ha, ha, capitalism, power.
6073000	6074000	I've got the big guns.
6074000	6075000	I've got the money.
6075000	6076000	I've got everything.
6076000	6077000	I believe you know Ed 209.
6077000	6080000	Ed 209's got rockets, got Gatling guns,
6080000	6086000	and Robocop can only get away with him from him by going downstairs.
6087000	6090000	And then you have this comical, sad moment of Ed 209,
6090000	6094000	like a little chicken on its back on the stairs.
6094000	6097000	And I love the fact that Ed 209 knows he can't do stairs,
6097000	6100000	that he does a little tiptoe.
6100000	6104000	He's like a dog trying to go in the pool.
6104000	6106000	So the thing that Phil did that was interesting
6106000	6108000	is he always thought Phil was a baby.
6108000	6109000	He was a prototype.
6109000	6112000	So he always made him like a young idea.
6112000	6115000	So you sort of like him a little bit.
6115000	6117000	Because he's trying to settle Eddy.
6117000	6118000	Eddy, yeah.
6118000	6121000	He just thought, yeah.
6121000	6123000	Through the design phase, they're like,
6123000	6127000	we've got to make him stair capable, right?
6127000	6128000	It's really true.
6128000	6130000	That's the issue of the hubris and robotics.
6130000	6134000	But he's for urban pacification.
6134000	6135000	He's a tank.
6135000	6137000	I love the realizing that.
6137000	6140000	Well, Ryan Coctevett says, who cares if it didn't work?
6140000	6141000	Right.
6141000	6143000	Well, realizing that something as simple as stairs
6143000	6146000	that we don't associate with humanization
6146000	6149000	can actually make the difference between us and the system.
6149000	6151000	What's the Doctor Who guys that can't get up the stairs?
6151000	6152000	Daleks.
6152000	6154000	The Daleks can't get up the stairs.
6154000	6156000	But also there's the rock people.
6156000	6158000	There's the big old rock fuckers.
6158000	6159000	Rock lords.
6159000	6161000	Here's something that's really important to me.
6161000	6164000	The return threshold, which I'm always at.
6164000	6166000	So this is a really complicated thing
6166000	6168000	to talk to people about.
6168000	6170000	What is this fucking return threshold?
6170000	6172000	And I'm like, you get your ass kicked.
6173000	6176000	And I think by far is like the most often
6176000	6179000	that I reference this particular thing in Robocop,
6179000	6181000	which, however, it seems to have so much
6181000	6184000	to do with location scouting, choreography.
6184000	6189000	It's the fact that Robocop, after fleeing at 209,
6189000	6192000	and he goes out front, and now the floodlights come on him
6192000	6197000	and his own brother policemen have been assigned to kill him.
6197000	6198000	They open fire on him.
6198000	6200000	He retreats into the parking garage.
6200000	6203000	And the way that he gets away, but it's like a,
6203000	6205000	I don't know if pyrrhic victory is the right description of it,
6205000	6210000	but he's in a parking garage laying down
6210000	6215000	and he simply rolls like.
6215000	6217000	So the other day I'm having lunch with Paul Verhoeven.
6217000	6220000	And I said, so how do you work with Jan de Bont
6220000	6222000	versus how do you work with Jo Sorkano?
6222000	6224000	These were the two cinematographers that he worked with.
6224000	6226000	Jan de Bont, by the way, shot Die Hard.
6226000	6229000	But he said, and he told me this one was this way
6229000	6230000	and this one was that way.
6230000	6232000	And he said, Joost always had really good ideas.
6232000	6234000	And I remember this, and he told me this.
6234000	6237000	I remember Joost going, oh wait, over here.
6237000	6238000	See where all these ramps are going?
6238000	6240000	He can get away that way.
6240000	6241000	And no human could.
6241000	6242000	I don't know.
6242000	6243000	It just worked out.
6243000	6244000	It's things that works in movies.
6244000	6245000	I mean, he's surrounded with Kevlar.
6245000	6247000	It's his blessing and his curse.
6247000	6249000	But it's a lovely, I mean, Paul just said,
6249000	6251000	it was so lovely he had that idea
6251000	6253000	because it got us out of this problem.
6253000	6254000	How do you get out of this?
6254000	6256000	Just think that there's no way,
6256000	6258000	sometimes in my worst moments I'm cursing myself
6258000	6261000	because I'm like, I imagine you writing that somehow.
6261000	6262000	Didn't write that.
6262000	6264000	In the script, how did he get out of there?
6264000	6266000	I think there was a cut and then a new scene
6266000	6268000	and he was running away and nobody around.
6268000	6269000	You hacked.
6269000	6270000	Something like that.
6270000	6273000	He did like a newspaper, a robot confiscate.
6273000	6274000	No, no, it was harrowing.
6274000	6276000	He had to be saved by Lewis.
6276000	6278000	It was tree, X tree.
6278000	6280000	Robot man gets away.
6280000	6282000	It must have cost him a fortune.
6282000	6285000	No, no, we had to get to the moment where Lewis comes in
6285000	6288000	and says Murphy is me, Lewis.
6288000	6289000	Yeah.
6289000	6290000	And we knew that.
6290000	6292000	In fact, I once pitched that to Stan Lee.
6292000	6294000	And Stan Lee liked that so much, he said,
6294000	6296000	oh, wait, here's the really good part
6296000	6298000	where he comes and finds his character.
6298000	6299000	Yeah.
6299000	6301000	So what you don't know is that this almost
6301000	6302000	was a Marvel comic book.
6302000	6305000	And thank God it wasn't because they were going to buy.
6305000	6308000	Stan Lee wanted to buy it at a certain point
6308000	6309000	for a comic book.
6309000	6311000	And then he asked me if it was,
6311000	6314000	hadn't I just read Death Lock and maybe they owned it anyway.
6314000	6316000	And then they decided, because Marvel wasn't
6316000	6318000	a very successful company, then they decided not to do it.
6318000	6319000	And it went to Orion.
6319000	6322000	Oh, thank God for Stan Lee's lack of success.
6322000	6323000	Yeah.
6323000	6325000	Well, he did OK after that.
6325000	6326000	That's so funny.
6326000	6328000	I love the baller.
6328000	6330000	And I'm going to be a cynic and say,
6330000	6333000	I bet Stan Lee as a Hail Mary in every meeting back then
6333000	6337000	would say, never having even seen Death Lock,
6337000	6340000	that he would just go, are you sure this isn't just Death
6340000	6344000	Black because 10% of the time a writer would cave and go,
6344000	6345000	yeah, it is.
6345000	6346000	I didn't realize how dangerous it
6346000	6349000	was to talk to people like that, actually, at the time.
6349000	6350000	Because they had all these characters.
6350000	6353000	But I think Marvel was moribund.
6353000	6356000	There was a secretary and one other guy in Stan Lee out here.
6356000	6357000	And that was it.
6357000	6359000	I met him when I was a young executive universal.
6359000	6361000	And he had nothing better to do than go out to have lunch
6361000	6362000	with me.
6362000	6364000	How crazy is it that comic books can do this?
6364000	6367000	Who at the fortune cookie place writes,
6367000	6369000	your job is to serve the public trust?
6369000	6370000	I don't know.
6370000	6372000	But it was right on Robertson.
6372000	6373000	It was right there.
6373000	6374000	What?
6374000	6377000	Remember when fortune cookies were bad ass, though?
6377000	6379000	Did you save that fortune cookie?
6379000	6380000	I don't know.
6380000	6381000	I might be somewhere in a box.
6381000	6383000	Fortune cookies became advice cookies.
6383000	6385000	They became like, you know, sometimes wearing a tie
6385000	6387000	can make you feel more confident.
6387000	6389000	It's like, did someone start suing fortune cookies?
6389000	6391000	Because they used to say like, a dude's
6391000	6394000	going to murder you with something red.
6394000	6396000	They were fun.
6396000	6399000	I get why they said duck.
6399000	6401000	That was the menu, you dummy.
6405000	6407000	Biggest cookie I ever saw.
6407000	6410000	Couldn't even eat it.
6410000	6414000	I get drunk throughout the show.
6414000	6415000	I'm never going to get over that.
6415000	6418000	One of the prime directors was from a fortune cookie.
6418000	6420000	That's just like, that's the universe,
6420000	6422000	just helping you make a movie perfect.
6422000	6425000	I think there's something worth noting, which is your legacy,
6426000	6430000	one of your kids is this really interesting,
6430000	6435000	and the description of their work is so thoroughly modern.
6435000	6437000	Shane is a disability rights activist.
6437000	6438000	She's a lawyer.
6438000	6439000	They're a lawyer.
6439000	6443000	Disability activist, but also a whole,
6443000	6446000	yeah, transgender activist.
6449000	6454000	It's as if you had a child that became a...
6455000	6457000	It's a trans thing, isn't it?
6457000	6461000	It's a trans human idea in a weird way.
6461000	6464000	There is something about that, and it is a little bit haunting.
6464000	6466000	Something, something, something, future, future.
6466000	6471000	I imagine that must make you proud and...
6471000	6475000	I don't want to assume me.
6475000	6479000	I'm frightened of what they do these days.
6479000	6481000	No, I'm kidding.
6481000	6484000	They just won a big settlement against a place
6484000	6487000	that uses electric shock on kids.
6489000	6492000	Because they're an autistic activist as well.
6492000	6493000	Yeah.
6493000	6499000	And also about basically how the mentally ill are treated.
6499000	6501000	And it's not a pretty picture, of course.
6501000	6502000	Yeah.
6502000	6506000	But Shane does all that kind of stuff, and Shane is out there.
6506000	6509000	And I do feel like Shane, in what they're doing,
6509000	6513000	is sort of saying, I don't want to be a human like other humans are.
6513000	6515000	I am not a human like other humans are.
6515000	6518000	But what I am is...
6518000	6521000	They are autistic, they have facial anomalies,
6521000	6523000	so they don't look like other people.
6523000	6525000	And that is an interesting experience, that way,
6525000	6528000	to be so different in the world.
6528000	6530000	I think sometimes it's extremely difficult for them.
6530000	6535000	But also it gives them a certain kind of power and audacity.
6535000	6538000	One of my favorite things that happens occasionally,
6538000	6539000	Shane will call me up and say,
6539000	6541000	well, I went to the airport the other day,
6541000	6544000	and they talk to me like I was mentally retarded.
6544000	6547000	And I always kind of laugh when that happens,
6547000	6549000	because I know what's coming next.
6549000	6552000	And Shane will tell them that they're a lawyer and watch out.
6552000	6554000	It's been amazing.
6556000	6558000	What is their relationship with your work?
6558000	6561000	Like, you've got this kid,
6561000	6565000	and you're going through decades of a screenwriting career
6565000	6569000	where you're celebrated, you're on red carpets,
6569000	6572000	there's VHS boxes in line at the grocery store.
6572000	6574000	I don't know how the ages work out,
6574000	6577000	how old Shane was and how old Casey was.
6577000	6579000	Shane was born the year the movie came out,
6579000	6581000	and my son was born two years later.
6581000	6583000	So it was after...
6583000	6585000	They grew up with that in the shadow of that.
6585000	6590000	I often think that it's almost hard to see.
6590000	6592000	It's just like everywhere around.
6593000	6596000	And I think it was later
6596000	6599000	that they would both in different ways experience something of it.
6599000	6602000	I noticed that both of them don't talk about it much.
6602000	6604000	Occasionally they'll pull it out if it's the right thing to pull out,
6604000	6607000	which I'm really happy that they can get anything out of it all.
6607000	6610000	But mostly it's just like, I think,
6610000	6612000	they had to put up with all the other parts of me.
6612000	6614000	Is it weird for you that...
6614000	6617000	When you hear Dan and Rob and I,
6617000	6621000	probably half the people you've met since 1987,
6621000	6624000	talk about the stuff that you've made,
6624000	6627000	and when they talk about what it meant to them
6627000	6630000	or what their reaction to it is,
6630000	6633000	do you ever just feel like they're...
6633000	6639000	You're hearing them say things about the movie that you didn't intend, but...
6639000	6641000	I actually don't think it has that much to...
6641000	6643000	All of that, it's a wonderful thing that happens,
6643000	6645000	and I kind of like it,
6645000	6647000	but it doesn't have anything to do with me.
6647000	6650000	It's not me, it's the movie.
6650000	6652000	And the fact that people like it
6652000	6655000	and are in any way inspired by it is sort of amazing to me,
6655000	6659000	and it wasn't something I thought could ever happen.
6659000	6660000	I've heard people say,
6660000	6662000	well, the reason I went to film school,
6662000	6665000	sitting literally where I was sitting at UCLA is because of this movie.
6665000	6667000	And that's weird.
6667000	6669000	Sometimes I think, well, I hope that was right.
6669000	6673000	When the script was done, went into production,
6673000	6674000	and they're making the film,
6674000	6676000	and you got through the suit problems and all this stuff,
6676000	6678000	and then you were going into editing,
6678000	6681000	how confident were you that this was going to be a success or a failure,
6681000	6683000	or was it totally up in the air?
6683000	6685000	Well, I remember the first time we saw the first cut of it,
6685000	6686000	it was really...
6686000	6688000	And I had never seen a first cut of anything before,
6688000	6691000	and I remember the director and I walked out like,
6691000	6692000	what is that?
6692000	6695000	And the sound was all wrong, and everything was wrong,
6695000	6697000	and when he walked the sound like he was walking on toilet plungers,
6697000	6699000	it was just terrible.
6699000	6701000	Big chain like that.
6701000	6702000	It was like that, yeah.
6702000	6704000	And then all the stuff came...
6704000	6706000	It was a great learning process for me,
6706000	6708000	and then all the sound came in, and Steve Flick,
6708000	6710000	who did all those sounds, and did the roar,
6710000	6711000	and put the lion's roar...
6711000	6714000	Yeah, the footsteps.
6714000	6715000	Could you talk about the footsteps?
6715000	6717000	That cthunk sound is...
6717000	6718000	What is that?
6718000	6720000	Well, that's because Steve Flick is a genius,
6720000	6722000	and Steve Flick did pulp fiction,
6722000	6724000	and he did Starship, and he was just the genius sound guy.
6724000	6728000	Did he ever say like, oh, that's a hot dog vendor?
6728000	6730000	You know, Steve was the first guy who was saying,
6730000	6733000	well, there's 100 tracks in this effect,
6733000	6736000	and you know, so try and figure out what that is.
6736000	6737000	Yeah.
6737000	6738000	I don't know what...
6738000	6739000	Sometimes you get those fun things, though,
6739000	6742000	like the exorcist with the cage of bees, or the...
6742000	6745000	Well, there's a lion roar and an ape roar
6745000	6747000	in that thing that you're doing with Ed 209.
6747000	6750000	That's really a lion and an ape, and something else.
6750000	6752000	I honestly just thought that was the MGM lion.
6752000	6754000	No, it was an MGM until later.
6754000	6756000	That's a good idea. We should put that in.
6756000	6757000	I'll tell them.
6757000	6759000	I'll tell them.
6759000	6761000	But anyway, to answer your question,
6762000	6764000	it was like I didn't know if it would work.
6764000	6766000	I remember hoping it would work.
6766000	6767000	It was...
6767000	6769000	And then I saw it, and I thought...
6769000	6771000	I had to see it in front of an audience for the first time,
6771000	6773000	and people laughed right away, and I thought,
6773000	6774000	oh, that's good.
6774000	6775000	And then the second screening,
6775000	6777000	they laughed in all the same places.
6777000	6779000	One of the things that happened in the first screening was
6779000	6782000	when Murphy gets killed in the first version,
6782000	6785000	it was much bloodier, and there were these shots of the floor
6785000	6786000	that were covered with blood.
6786000	6787000	You're kidding.
6787000	6789000	And every time that happened,
6789000	6791000	10 women would get up and leave the room.
6791000	6793000	And when we cut the floor out,
6793000	6795000	when we cut shots of blood out,
6797000	6799000	then only one person got it.
6799000	6800000	Well, because it is...
6800000	6802000	I mean, I was telling you, it's a traumatic thing,
6802000	6803000	and it is like...
6803000	6804000	I guess that's a tightrope,
6804000	6806000	because it's your point of immersion,
6806000	6808000	but I guess if you're overdoing it, it feels pornographic,
6808000	6810000	then the women are going to go,
6810000	6812000	you know, it seems like you're having fun with this,
6812000	6815000	as opposed to it seems like maybe you understand.
6815000	6818000	And now it occurs to me that there's a lot of stuffing
6818000	6819000	coming out of...
6819000	6823000	It's almost like it's a horrible, violent killing of a teddy bear.
6823000	6826000	Well, if you look at it, it's also a crucifixion.
6826000	6828000	He plays it that way for a second.
6828000	6829000	Well, he gets his hands shot off.
6829000	6830000	It's so awful.
6830000	6832000	Well, there's even a moment where he's like...
6832000	6833000	Like that.
6833000	6834000	And that was one of the things...
6834000	6836000	So to answer a question earlier,
6836000	6837000	Verhoeven coming into it.
6837000	6839000	Verhoeven reads the second draft
6839000	6841000	and reads the title page, Robocop,
6841000	6842000	The Future of Law Enforcement,
6842000	6843000	and he goes,
6843000	6844000	I'm never going to do this,
6844000	6846000	and he doesn't read the script.
6847000	6850000	So Barbara Boyle at Orion Pictures sent it to him
6850000	6851000	and said, why don't you read it?
6851000	6854000	Maybe you could read it again for the subtext.
6854000	6856000	So he gave it to his wife, Martine,
6856000	6858000	and she read it, and she said,
6858000	6860000	you know, I think you should read this.
6860000	6862000	I think there's going to be something in it that you like.
6862000	6865000	And he got to the scene with the hand being blown off,
6865000	6866000	and he says...
6866000	6867000	He said, let's go.
6867000	6868000	We're going to go to America.
6868000	6869000	We're going to go do this.
6869000	6871000	So he said he'd never seen anything like that.
6871000	6873000	He responded well to that.
6873000	6875000	Didn't he say there was a lot of, like,
6875000	6877000	Jesus metaphors in there,
6877000	6879000	like he's walking on the water at the end?
6879000	6881000	No, we always knew we were playing around
6881000	6883000	with Jesus and Frankenstein, you know,
6883000	6884000	depending on which...
6884000	6886000	And he is...
6886000	6887000	He's very interested in Jesus.
6887000	6890000	He actually was a Jesus scholar for 25 years,
6890000	6892000	and he really wanted to do the story of Jesus.
6892000	6893000	But when we were in Pittsburgh
6893000	6894000	and we were trying...
6894000	6897000	We were in that steel plant,
6897000	6899000	and he took me over to that tank,
6899000	6901000	and he said that with these big walls,
6901000	6903000	and he said that's one of the most beautiful things
6903000	6904000	I've ever seen.
6904000	6906000	And I said, it's like the walls of an ancient city.
6906000	6908000	And I said, well, that's great.
6908000	6909000	We've got to use that then.
6909000	6911000	And so that became the walking on water scene,
6911000	6912000	came out of that.
6912000	6914000	Did Martine and he break up before Showgirls?
6914000	6915000	No.
6915000	6917000	Oh, okay. Sorry.
6917000	6919000	No, no, no.
6919000	6921000	They're still happily married together
6921000	6923000	all these many years later.
6923000	6924000	All right.
6924000	6926000	Why?
6926000	6929000	Did you like Showgirls?
6930000	6933000	Well, you know, Showgirls was the movie he was doing
6933000	6935000	when we were trying to get him to do it,
6935000	6936000	when I wanted him to do structure.
6936000	6938000	Talking about the things that make you feel good.
6938000	6939000	And when...
6939000	6940000	Well, there's that guy.
6940000	6942000	There's my partner.
6942000	6945000	There's the other piston of this engine, but minus me.
6945000	6948000	Yeah, there was a moment where Paul was going to be...
6948000	6950000	No, Paul had already done two movies in a row.
6950000	6952000	Paul was the biggest director in Hollywood
6952000	6953000	for a moment and a half there
6953000	6955000	because he'd done Total Recall,
6955000	6956000	and then he'd done...
6956000	6957000	He's amazing, obviously.
6957000	6958000	He's really good.
6958000	6961000	And then he did Showgirls, and then Showgirls...
6961000	6963000	There was almost a moment where I thought,
6963000	6965000	he won't do this movie because he can do anything.
6965000	6968000	And so when Showgirls crashed and burned a little,
6968000	6969000	it was kind of good for me.
6969000	6972000	And actually, the sort of neat thing about him was,
6972000	6975000	I went over to see him like on a Thursday.
6975000	6977000	The movie was going to come out on a Friday.
6977000	6979000	And he was so full of himself,
6979000	6981000	and he was so like, yeah, maybe we'll do your movie.
6981000	6982000	I'm not sure.
6982000	6985000	Or maybe I'll buy Mars or something like that.
6985000	6988000	And then it came out, and it got bad reviews,
6988000	6993000	and on Sunday, he came out to my house in Eagle Rock,
6993000	6995000	and we sat down and we started working on Starship.
6995000	6998000	And later on, I asked him, how did you recover from that?
6998000	6999000	That was such a drubbing...
6999000	7001000	I mean, how do you deal with that?
7001000	7002000	Because it's hard to deal with that stuff.
7002000	7004000	And he said, I just went to work right away.
7004000	7005000	With you?
7005000	7006000	With me.
7006000	7007000	With his old friend.
7007000	7008000	Which I take...
7008000	7009000	No, no, it's true.
7009000	7011000	You're still friends with him today.
7011000	7012000	Yeah, absolutely.
7012000	7013000	I just had lunch with him on Friday.
7013000	7014000	Let's bring him out.
7014000	7017000	In fact, I told him I was going to do this, and...
7017000	7019000	Oh, and he's going to listen, and now he's never...
7019000	7020000	Well, he's...
7020000	7021000	I don't know if he'll listen or not.
7021000	7022000	We're ending the show anyway.
7022000	7023000	It doesn't matter.
7023000	7024000	He might hear about it.
7024000	7025000	Maybe he won't, but...
7025000	7026000	All right, thanks for coming in.
7026000	7027000	That's been our time, everybody.
7027000	7029000	Give it up for Ed Nimoy, everybody.
7029000	7030000	Thank you.
7030000	7031000	Thank you.
7033000	7034000	Rob Tromb.
7037000	7038000	Everybody here tonight,
7038000	7040000	you can type right after comptroller Jeff Davis.
7040000	7042000	Your mayor, Jane Herman.
7045000	7046000	Thank you all.
7047000	7049000	Let's all go home and watch Robocop again.
7049000	7051000	Drive fast and take chances.
7051000	7053000	Zach, put a beat on before you get peed on.
7072000	7073000	Did you get any of that?
7074000	7076000	It's a good show.
