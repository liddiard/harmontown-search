0	5000	I'm going to start off on a sad note, but for a good reason.
5000	7000	Lou Reed, baby.
14000	17000	Rest in peace, Lou Reed.
19000	22000	Let's just groove on him for a moment.
30000	36000	Hello, Harbin Town. Yes.
36000	39000	It seems a melancholy note to begin a comedy show, but fuck it.
39000	44000	Lou Reed passed away this morning, and let's dedicate this one to him, shall we?
51000	54000	And as sad as this song seems,
54000	58000	But she's not afraid to...
58000	66000	It's fucking good stuff. Welcome to the stage, the mayor of Harbin Town, the king of sadness, Dan Harmon.
69000	71000	Thank you.
74000	76000	All right.
76000	81000	It's a special, uh, sleepy, sad, uh, Harbin Town.
81000	83000	And it's not Lou Reed's fault, really, for dying.
83000	86000	Well, is it? It might be. It might be.
86000	88000	No, I was going to be sleepy and sad no matter what.
88000	95000	My girlfriend's out of town, and, uh, I don't know if I've ever been this apart from her this long.
95000	97000	I can't remember.
97000	99000	Well, it's been, like, four days? Yeah.
99000	100000	That's the longest?
100000	104000	Yeah, we kind of just started spending every day together when we started hanging out, so...
104000	105000	When is she back?
105000	108000	Uh, Tuesday or something.
108000	111000	It's going to be, what, near on a week?
111000	120000	Yeah. She left a basket of gifts, uh, next to the front door, one for each day that she's gone, that I can open.
120000	129000	Which leads me to item number one in my segment tonight called Things Dan Harmon's Not allowed to complain about.
129000	132000	Which, and item number one is my girlfriend loves me too much.
132000	136000	Um, I can't keep up. I can't... How am I supposed to match something like that?
136000	143000	I'm reading that off of one of the gifts that she got me the first night, uh, which is my new gold eye harmon.
143000	148000	Which is this kind of hinged, clasped kind of affair.
148000	156000	But, I guess item number two that I'm not allowed to complain about is this thing. It sucks.
156000	159000	I mean, functionally. It's gorgeous.
159000	163000	Certainly, like, aesthetically, it looks like exactly what you wanted.
163000	166000	It's got a slender, it's all love, no function.
166000	171000	It's, uh, it's got a sticker on the front that says eye harmon with my silhouette on it.
171000	176000	It's held together with the pen so that when you pull the pen out, it springs open.
176000	184000	But it's one of those slippery, shitty, twisty pens that you have to twist to get the ink nub out of.
185000	194000	Also, the paper, it's like that paper that every three centimeters, there's a random spot that won't take the ink.
194000	196000	You know what I'm talking about?
196000	198000	It's a piece of shit.
200000	205000	Yeah, for me, the deal breaker is the quality of the paper. You want good paper that takes ink well.
205000	209000	I mean, yeah. So, she loves me a lot.
209000	213000	Have you written any notes down in that one?
213000	218000	Well, I wrote, girlfriend loves me too much as the number one thing.
218000	221000	But I kept having to start over because the paper sucks.
221000	224000	I had other stuff on there that I now can't remember.
224000	227000	It's going to be a bad show because of this thing.
228000	230000	What else has she got in you so far?
230000	233000	She got me some throwing knives.
233000	237000	When I was younger, I used to throw knives in my backyard.
237000	247000	So, she got me some throwing knives and she put a target on the fence that separates my place from my neighbor's place.
247000	251000	It's this really low fence.
251000	257000	Even if you hit the fence, you're still fucking up your own fence and probably your neighbor's fence.
257000	259000	Or killing a child.
259000	261000	Yeah, nine times out of ten.
261000	266000	If you've ever played darts before, yeah, about 20% of the darts go over the top of the board.
266000	276000	What were the circumstances that you came home when morning or day and Jay Johnson and I were at your old apartment and we had taken actual kitchen knives.
276000	280000	You were just throwing them at a door in my apartment, or a wall.
280000	284000	At a wall and we had destroyed a wall in your place.
284000	288000	I think the circumstances were booze and probably other drugs.
288000	290000	Certainly drugs.
290000	296000	I think I went to work and came back and you guys were still doing it.
296000	303000	We had taken like a bucket out and drawn a circle and then like a plate and drawn a smaller circle.
303000	307000	We numbered them and we were like betting a dollar a throw.
307000	311000	And then I came home, I got up, went to work.
311000	313000	I didn't get up. I stayed up all night with you guys.
313000	314000	I forgot about this.
314000	323000	I went to work, came home, and when I came home, when I opened my apartment's front door, confetti fell.
323000	330000	Because one of the many dumb drunk things you guys did was set like a confetti trap.
330000	340000	I came into this just two red puffy adults like laughing and crying because confetti had fallen on my head.
340000	344000	Anyone watching objectively would have been like, this is not worth celebrating.
344000	351000	That confetti is alcoholism. This is a movie of the week.
351000	355000	It's a sleepy sad harm in town.
355000	360000	It looks like the attendees agree, I think.
360000	363000	We're not packed to the rafters here.
363000	373000	Part of what I blame for it is the Halloween people. Whoever schedules Halloween, putting it on a Thursday afternoon.
373000	377000	It's the worst possible day. There's no weekend leading up to it.
377000	378000	Nobody knows what to do.
378000	382000	And no one's going to dress up really joyfully on the day after Halloween.
382000	386000	Some women are just dressing like a cat for two weeks in a row. They don't know what to do.
386000	392000	They're just like, I have a tail. Just in case. A lot of people are doing nothing.
392000	398000	I was going to dress up as Erin in honor of her version of dressing up as me.
398000	402000	Well, she looked like Robert Smith in The Cure.
402000	414000	But you didn't want to dress as Spencer when I suggested let's all dress as Spencer because that wouldn't involve makeup and women's clothes.
414000	418000	You keep pushing for second year of David Bowie in a row.
418000	427000	I wasn't pushing for that. I was saying I was going to go for what's easy and you shouldn't dress up like your friends.
427000	430000	Guy likes to dress as women. That's all I know.
430000	436000	Why women? David Bowie in Labyrinth is kind of a woman, but he's still a guy.
436000	439000	He's the Goblin King.
439000	441000	You were Snow White one year.
441000	442000	I was.
442000	447000	But that was because my girlfriend at the time had a Snow White costume from her oversized roommate.
447000	452000	All right. Well, I didn't know I was cornering you about this. I thought this was.
452000	456000	Oh, I'll dress as women. I have multiple wigs at home.
456000	460000	All right. Let's bring up Spencer bright and early.
460000	461000	Right now. I love it.
461000	468000	Let's keep this sleepy train rolling.
468000	471000	Hey, hello. How's it going, you guys?
472000	476000	Are you nice and sleepy, Spencer?
476000	478000	I'm pretty I'm pretty nice and sleepy.
478000	482000	Yeah. Everybody got their headache on. Everybody got a sleepy headache.
482000	488000	I woke up at 6 a.m. in Fairhaven, Washington, and flew in only moments ago.
488000	495000	I woke up, took a two hour drive to Seattle, flew, went straight to our D&D game with you guys.
495000	500000	We had our little it was just Spencer, Dan and Rob Schraben.
500000	505000	That was a pretty sleepy D&D game. Rob Schrab was Rob Schraben supine through most of it.
505000	509000	He was he was he was actually laying down on his back and very much facts. It's your turn.
509000	513000	I. All right. We'd wake up and he would cast some sort of spell.
513000	518000	Yeah. We killed lots of lots of baddies, though. All right.
518000	521000	Let's let's let's keep the sleepy train rolling.
521000	526000	Let's get some of these sleepy people's problems. Who's who's depressed tonight?
527000	531000	And I'm not asking, like, who's got a problem?
531000	538000	Like, you don't need you can just say if you're depressed, if you were feeling like at the bottom of your biorhythmic curve,
538000	542000	nobody, everybody, everybody, everybody's walking on sunshine.
542000	548000	Well, no, I don't want I don't want people stepping into the role. I'll pretend to be depressed.
548000	552000	That's nice. No, that's good. Let's look at that as a beautiful aurora borealis.
552000	557000	Real quick, just like to set the barometer. Are you up, down, down?
557000	561000	I'm definitely down because Aaron's gone or because Aaron's gone.
561000	564000	I don't know why I had I had kind of a headache all day.
564000	568000	You know what? I've been playing this video game that she got for me. That was her second gift to me.
568000	578000	Or Saturday's gift was this Ellen Page Willem Dafoe video game where you're just like it's one of those video games.
578000	580000	I don't expect you to understand this.
580000	585000	I know who Willem Dafoe is. That's it. I know. But but but there's this there's this kind of video game.
585000	591000	I'm assuming it's the exact same company that made that deep rain or whatever it is, hard rain, heavy rain.
591000	599000	Thank you. Deep rain, heavy rain, thick rain, wet rain.
599000	604000	I was kind of I played the whole game through this one, this Ellen Page Willem Dafoe one.
604000	614000	And it's really weird. Like on paper, it shouldn't be fun at all because it really is just much more like you're watching a movie and they just kind of invite you to move along with your joystick.
614000	622000	Like because you can tell from observing what's happening that it probably doesn't matter what you do, basically, because you can't die that I know of.
622000	624000	Is it a shooter? Is it a thriller?
624000	636000	It's like it's just sort of a it's kind of a sci fi Japanese kind of chick flick.
636000	639000	I don't know how to describe the genre of the adventure you're on.
639000	642000	So you're just a protagonist in a film?
642000	650000	Yeah, yeah. And it's a sort of spiritual, dramatic thriller about about supernatural powers and stuff.
650000	654000	And you're you just kind of go through this twenty five hour movie.
654000	657000	Had you asked for this video game? No, no, she just got it for me.
657000	660000	And it was nice because I really wasn't in the mood to play Grand Theft Auto.
660000	666000	I love Grand Theft Auto. It's working great. But I kind of like it's sort of it's I don't know what it is.
666000	671000	I wouldn't have played it otherwise. But having a new thing that I knew would probably take two days, I just put it in.
671000	679000	And played it in my monogram PJs that she also got me. And she also got me dark chocolate peanut butter cup.
679000	683000	I miss her so much. But I was Ellen Page all weekend.
683000	692000	Maybe that's why I'm depressed. I was just I was just Ellen Page with like this spiritual entity following me that I could use to open drawers and find clues.
692000	697000	So I'm just feeling a feeling a little depressed. Can you choose to be willing to follow?
697000	701000	No, you cannot. And you wouldn't want to be. He's weird.
701000	705000	He does not translate well to video game. Ellen Page works very well.
705000	710000	Whatever goop they put on your face, whatever ping pong balls they taped to your head to capture your your movement and stuff.
710000	712000	She made a good protagonist for a video game.
712000	717000	Willem Dafoe, all of the bad things about Willem Dafoe come through in a video game.
717000	724000	And all of the humanity is left behind. And if Gina Davis were eating a plate of Willem Dafoe that came through a telepod,
724000	732000	she would go, it's synthetic. Willem Dafoe is 90 percent skull.
732000	737000	There's a lot of skull to Willem Dafoe. He's cracky.
737000	748000	When he and William Sadler were separated through the screen door of actors, Sadler got a lot of the humanity.
748000	754000	And Dafoe only got so much that stripped away again by this game. So anyways.
754000	757000	So headache. Headache. Ellen Page video game.
757000	761000	I've been Ellen Page all weekend. Missing Erin. Missing Erin.
761000	766000	So throwing darts. There was last week too. The lady came up and that was weird, right?
766000	771000	I loved it. I didn't listen to it. I was afraid to listen to it because I'm just so tired.
771000	776000	There's a lethargy to this too. Like I'm just so tired of being a fucking bad person. So tired.
776000	780000	I don't think you worry about being emotionally tired. Like it's like you feel like your emotions are doing so.
780000	784000	Is Lisa here right now, by the way? No.
784000	791000	She got into a personal submarine and like went to Tokyo.
791000	797000	I think one of the writers told me that somebody wrote an email saying she's resigned from the fandom or something.
797000	803000	Oh wow. Look. I have no fucking horse in this race.
803000	814000	I either to see man. She came up here and was like she had this sort of I mean you have a Christ complex but your Christ complex Christ complex met hers.
814000	818000	And she was like I just wish people would stop asking me what I thought about this stuff.
818000	827000	But that's what the whole thing was for sale. Like she hated you but loves community and hated being on stage but clearly needed to be.
827000	832000	I don't know. I think the biggest the most unanticipated kind of blowback from that was that.
832000	840000	What should have occurred to me what sometimes happens at Harman Town is that in our haste to like have a dialogue.
840000	849000	We forget that only a kind of diehard Harman Town person knows that coming up on stage is not a bad thing.
849000	854000	It's not like coming up to a witness stand. It's not like you're under arrest for something.
854000	858000	And I was a little thrown by the fact that she did not come up smiling.
858000	863000	I expected when I when I say is so and so here I expect that to be the equivalent of tickling them.
863000	868000	And I said it's so and so here and she was like well I don't know.
868000	873000	I mean it was like oh shit we fucked up. And how do you do. Red wire or blue wire.
873000	879000	And it didn't matter just because I am not skilled at that. He's never heard of Harman Town.
879000	883000	She only loves community and never heard the show. I don't know. I don't know.
883000	888000	The first thing that like I noticed was that she came up and it was contentious.
888000	896000	Like she came up in a very cross looking kind of posture. Yeah it's a shame. It's a bummer.
896000	902000	Did that. What was the fallout for you from that. There hasn't been a I kind of like I've taken the opportunity.
902000	909000	I was like you know what I got a so many people I've talked to. I'm still I'm still on Twitter because Twitter seems pretty safe.
909000	919000	It's just sort of like this trickling stream of garbage. You know like you can't really you can't and you can't really mix it up or like write an essay about how someone should be crucified or something on Twitter.
919000	929000	It doesn't work. So I've been I've been trying to wean myself off of and this is such a sad thing to me like I I grew up on the Internet.
929000	945000	Somebody if somebody is writing the world's lowest stakes biopic you got to circle the irony here that went from the age of 13 like I was learning to interact with people on computers and and always wanted to write television and ended up out in L.A.
945000	969000	television in an era when this Internet thing that I had grown grown up on was actually starting to impact television and ended up with this weird crossroads where I had the first TV show that was sort of so so loved by a previously unmeasured demographic that it actually was able to stay on the air but at the same time was sort of like it's just such an odd weird swirling thing.
969000	988000	It was like my accessibility was you know became like part of a product. I don't know where I started buying into that stock or that press. I don't know what was fantasy. What was reality. I just always knew I still know one thing which is that I would rather die than not be able to talk about how I feel.
988000	1011000	And especially not in this medium that I understand where I can truly express myself which is the you know the typed word. And so that's always going to be a deal breaker for me with the tragic irony of this whole thing is like coming around to finally like I'm back on the I'm on the page now of all this like I just got to get these suitcases in my hand standing outside the Internet going like what happened.
1011000	1030000	I guess I'll just I'm just going to go. I'll just go do what rich people do. I'm just going to shuffle around my house and my slippers and like maybe I'll buy a boat and I like and I'll just be like Instagramming me and a jet ski because I'm like this is the life. This is what life is but that was never what life was for me.
1030000	1051000	Life was like life was sitting in forums and talking but just keys were built so that you could not take a selfie right. That and carpool DM we came up with carpool DM carpool DM. Did anyone ever come up with carpool DM Dan and Dan and I drove here today and we were ashamed that nobody has come up with carpool DM someone might have. We don't know.
1051000	1076000	So all of that you know why did we bring Spencer up so early again because he's a he's a he's a he's a laugh a minute. Yeah sure. Why are you throwing it to me. No I mean what does go. So I'm going to throw carpool DM carpool day that carpool day.
1076000	1100000	Singing to literal carpool day. Today's carpool DM because I got two people in my vehicle. Is that how you use it or you like hey man carpool the DM because that's wrong. Carpool the day. Yeah. Carpool carpool to DM.
1100000	1119000	No. See don't appease him. His thirst for logic just made a horrible slogan. I'm not suggesting that Spock didn't work in advertising. It was sometimes you just like like just do it says Nike. Spock could be like just do what captain.
1120000	1138000	And it'd be a fair question unless you know unless you were branding something. All right. That's not my arena you guys. Oh I'm confident in bidding that. But what it would have people that don't get on the Internet do like like golf hobbies golf. Yeah we should start golfing again.
1138000	1164000	Falcon rain. That'll make this show great. People can show up and listen to our dance stories. Yeah. I would I would suggest to you to start picking up falcon rain. I prefer joinery. You know wood joining. Wood joining. Yeah. You know you create joints and wood. What's your then join them together. What's your favorite method of joining wood together. Oh definitely the dovetail. Really. No no.
1165000	1192000	Because I I had you pay for a mortise and tenant man. You know that was the thing I was trying to go for. But my brain couldn't think of. When I worked at my book job I actually read through a shit ton of joinery books and I knew about the mortise and tenant joint. But I couldn't. I couldn't think of it now because I've been doing all this other stuff at jobs. Yeah. Mortise and tenant. He was like arch enemies with Henry David Thoreau. Right. No there were two brothers. One was tall and one was short.
1192000	1221000	The short one was the guy that haunted Ebenezer Scrooge. So they call it joinery. They don't just call it carpentry. I have no idea. I think joinery is like when you're not using like nails and shit. You're just you're using slots and the way you start the wood. Art of non adhesive. I think I think they use glue. Are you saying Dan you look you're in the market for a hobby that's not typing.
1222000	1251000	Words to strangers that you never will meet and hate you for no reason. No no no no. He's looking for something to do with his time. But that's what a hobby is essentially. No no. Here's what it is. It's a healthy thing because what I somehow came started doing was like sucking energy off of the Internet which I don't think you know it's a medium like you should. I if if I'm true to my lip service like I should be getting pleasure from putting shit out like expressing myself.
1251000	1277000	I have to somehow become a person that actually doesn't look at the response you know doesn't like pay attention like never clicks the little a in the circle on the Twitter client which it just seems weird because sometimes people are saying like hey you helped me or can I ask you a question but but you just kind of want to be able to go like and just like kind of exhale without inhaling without taking back.
1278000	1288000	And what I'm wondering is so what do I substitute because I was like sucking energy off of things like like like what do you do in normal life when you want to get energy.
1290000	1298000	You can't get on the Internet and suck your little thumb. Ask ask people here what they do. I don't think I think that they're pretty much like me. I don't know. But this guy's raising his hand.
1298000	1312000	You go to bars alone and talk to strangers. Bars alone to talk to strangers. All right. That sounds good. But certainly what I was doing from 91 to 2009 for a community started up.
1313000	1325000	But when you're when you said last week was last week you said that writing is gross people asking for hugs like like it's you saying like you're putting that stuff out there for the response.
1326000	1338000	It's not you putting things out. It's you receiving something back from them. So you you have a relationship with the Internet that I don't have. I wouldn't have because I like I couldn't do it like you.
1339000	1354000	You want the response. You can hear a thousand bits of praise and hear one bad thing and you'll obsess about that because you're looking for that information. You're trying to triangulate who you are based on strangers input.
1355000	1371000	Yeah. So I always want to know what's the worst thing that somebody could say about you because I want to move in that direction because last week it was saying don't talk. Right. Yeah. Which is like saying your shoe. Do anything different. Stop doing what you're doing.
1371000	1389000	Like you have a huge like energetic reaction to anybody saying change your behavior like in the in the in the what was the city the Pittsburgh show of the Herman tour when Aaron came out and she'd been affected by something and she said like that hurt my feelings and you said I'm sorry that you were hurt.
1389000	1418000	And she was like well are you are you sorry that I'm hurt. Are you sorry about what you said. And it was all about behavior modification like you don't you don't you don't want to be asked to change anything which is nobody wants to ask to be changed anything. We don't want to have to change. But we all must. We all do have to adapt if we want to grow. But any time anybody asks you what if I want to grow into a person that never has to change. What if I want to become like Godzilla.
1419000	1448000	Most to change into Godzilla. Yeah. You actually have to change DNA. Do that by not carrying what people think. Right. So I cut myself off from everybody like Godzilla and I slowly mutate into a giant lizard that breathes fire. Well the fear for you is that if you had to change anything you'd be sacrificing your identity. You'd lose who you are. Who you were. But but but the only thing that I am is a person that doesn't want to be told what to do. Well that's not true. You're what am I. I'm the guy that likes flower pressing. I'm not. No.
1448000	1477840	No. You're the guy that likes to do a million things. One of the things about you is that you hate being told to change. But change is adaptation evolution. It doesn't mean changing identity or changing essence. You're never going to change your essential qualities. But you could like you know you could change. You could learn to soften this about yourself or enhance that about yourself. That's not becoming a bad version of you or being bullied or bossed around. What is what is softening. And what is that. What is that.
1477840	1504840	I mean every every every fifth time you have something on your mind you don't say it. Is that what that is. No it's it's knowing the difference between saying what somebody needs to hear and saying what the first thing that came to your mind was. You can say both things at once. You can say you can express yourself without saying a hurtful thing to somebody that you care about. I don't. I truly don't. I don't think of myself as somebody that says a lot of hurtful things. Well no.
1504840	1534820	But you you know that you have the capacity to absolutely hurt somebody without meaning it at all. We all do. We all have that capacity. Like you can say something that you could have said. What are you. What are you. What are you saying. What what. How does one grow and change. What is the mandate there. You're asking a man. We don't know. We don't know how to do this being. Women have to come into our lives. We have to. We have to allow femininity into our lives and women go. Hey you know what. The thing you meant to say. Don't say it.
1534840	1564820	Just say hey they're there. Like just be a human being for a second and don't have an egotistical reaction to something and need like reinforcement at all fucking times. Like we think that like male egos are so fucking fragile and so brittle and so shitty. And we think that women have this power. And women think that we have this power but we don't. Like you can. You don't have to change any part of yourself to not be a cock.
1565560	1590100	You know like when you are in a bad mood. When my blood sugar is low if it's been a long drive and I need a fucking sandwich I become Liza Minnelli. I become a fucking like I become a cranky weirdo. And I will say things that I don't mean. But as you grow up ideally you learn to go like oh this is that feeling I get when Jeff Davis is about to become an absolute unsupportable cunt for no fucking reason.
1590460	1608640	And what I should do is go. Hey I'm sorry everybody. I'm going to take a walk. Like I'm going to like I'm going to recognize that what I'm about to do is be hurtful. And and before I say the hurtful thing that I know that I can do like Indiana Jones flips a fucking whip I will just like I will just say something soft instead of hard.
1608640	1620180	It just sounds like it's just a bunch of fucking garbage that a therapist tells you like this is such a bunch of like business casual cope with society. Like oh no no no no no. Is that really is that the way to get through the day.
1620400	1633980	Mr. Harmon Dan. No no. Make my girlfriend mad. Well next time do you think maybe you should do that. But then take a step back. Take a deep breath and maybe not do that as much. Yes you're right. I guess a perfect person wouldn't have done that. Well all right. That'll be seven hundred dollars.
1634800	1655760	Here's what I would say to that. I would say it's about being around people that you respect more than yourself. If you look down on everybody you don't fucking you don't ever like aspire to better behavior. If you treat people if you always aim down and whenever you're cranky vulnerable defensive whatever and you fire down on people that you cannot possibly grow.
1655760	1671660	But if you surround yourself by people whose opinions you covet and crave and want to nurture and you want them to think well of you then you start saying like what would I do to make people that I look up to look like look up to me.
1671960	1684620	And it's not it's not about softening and rounding off edges of your personality so you can make dumb people like you. It's about becoming more attractive to the people that you aspire to be or you know to be around.
1685400	1686060	That's interesting.
1688400	1689180	He burped.
1690320	1704280	Couldn't help it there. Yeah that's that's that's an interesting way of looking at it. I like that philosophy like you could keep you could keep somebody in your head instead of the guy in the back of the room who's got his arms folded going like that guy's not funny.
1704280	1723420	You know like like kind of like having this phantom heckler in your head like playing to an idiot you know trying to make idiots like you like imagining that that guy is you know Agent Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks or even if it's just a fictional character somebody that you look up to like I wouldn't want him to think I was a twat you know then yeah I like that.
1723420	1726420	That's good. That's smart. All right. We got that covered.
1728580	1730100	We're all going to be good people from now on.
1730720	1748720	Because nobody ever wants to live in a world where we had to change you one iota. We don't want you to ever have to like choke up on the bat and not be full force awesome crazy like rampant Dan Harmon.
1748720	1778720	We want you to always be firing like from the hip like you know like Jack Palim's and Shane like we want we want you to be a good guy a bad guy like a weirdo because you're a good writer and we can't you can't write well if you're thinking about what people think about what you're going to say right you need to say whatever you want to say but I just have to be thinking in my head when I'm saying it this one's for Obama no no what he's listening what you have what you have to think is like that it's possible to evolve
1778720	1808720	and still be you there's possible to be a higher version of you can elevate yourself above certain behavior that you yourself are not proud of that you say things that you regret later on and we drink and we say things drunken and we use that as an excuse and that's fine but you know or it's not fine but ideally there'd be a point when we stop saying things that are asinine or adolescent or a puerile or or hurtful and I like to think that at 40 years old I can't hurt people's feelings
1808720	1838720	anymore accidentally but guess what I'm fucking way better at it than I ever was like I can now just be dismissive of somebody and that's more hurtful so like we do have to like grow a bit and use our brains are evolved intellect I'm stupider than I was when I was 19 I was way more connected and way smarter than I was when I was when I was young or not that 40 years old but I look at myself now it's like I can be
1838720	1868720	crotchety I can be cross contrary I can be I can be a person that I wouldn't have liked when I was 19 so like it's not about me stopping being Jeff Davis it's about me like learning to finesse it a little bit and make it sexier you don't like that no it's just it's a it's a it's very complicated when when your relationship is with other people when
1868720	1898720	you when you gravitate towards this personality type that you know a lot of us in LA I think are you know we we want relationships with strangers we come out here seeking a hug from strangers and so some of us do stand up some of us write some of us direct some of us act but we were kind of we're we're a lot of us pursue some kind of craft like oh I'm James Dean I don't care who's watching but come on you're not you're not
1898720	1928720	making brick walls and even if you were people use brick walls and you want people to say what a good brick wall you did a good job the the the extreme personality that really wants validation you know that really drives you that's really when it's really part of your thing then you have this you have a relationship with strangers and then you have this this weird thing that that becomes like there's this feedback loop but I said what was my point my point was something you said
1928720	1958720	made me think like you know that I think the most complicated thing about all of us is that we all give ourselves so much more credit than than we think we do like everyone comes into every exchange almost like as an underdog everybody thinks that they're the one that needs to stick up we don't look at you and think of you as an underdog right well that's good you as a as a Titan that's the crazy thing though because you know it's you well boyfriends with their girlfriends don't don't look at their girlfriend and think like like she's like the underdog we look at that
1958720	1988720	everybody's holding power over us and we're all trying to rest power away from each other and that's why relationships relationships go bad yes because everybody is sticking up for them we said last week that you know we talked it was a week or two ago that we talked about or could've been fucking months ago about like when people come to you and are weird they want to find out if you think they're smart if they people want to come to me and find out if I think they're cool what do you want from other people when you go
1988720	2018720	like if you shake hands with these folks after the show when we were on tour like walking on the street from Aaron from anybody like what is it that you want from them what are you being worried about well I just I always just wanted people to tell me that there was a reason why I was born that I was I don't know I just want efficacy or not efficacy like you know contribution value to be loved I mean I don't know I think I think that I think the
2018720	2048720	part of my condition is like that that love like I think that like there's circuits that go through my circuit board that are there's parts of the board that are like have this carbon scoring on them on it and then so then there's either through detour or it I intellectual eyes love I think of love as a thing that is very conditional is very like you
2048720	2078720	know it's a thing that you don't just get because you're someone's son but when you go on a comment section on the internet what are you looking for what are you hoping you hear he's amazing he did a great job like he's really really good and what's the worst thing that you what's the thing that you're looking are you aiming at a certain thing that you don't want to hear he's he's a fraud he's overrated he's pretentious he doesn't he thinks that he's special and
2078720	2108720	he's not he's a completely ordinary completely lucky person who just wandered into my attention and he does not have any right to have it so how do you feel right now do you feel that you have the right to have that opinion of yourself do you feel like you're not too big for your boots that you deserve all this or the boots keep changing size as I keep walking forward and keep ending up in different climates that's no that's an open-ended yes that's it'll never change I think if you focus on that I think that's sickness I think that's the thing you can't you
2108720	2138720	you're never gonna win that game and you're not gonna arrive it's not empirical you can't measure it you will only that's that's codependence like you're going like you have to fill this unfillable hole and you can't you have to actually self actualize and go oh I know I know what I do and what I don't do I'm comfortable with it most of all I do my work and I step back I just do it because I like to do it and I'm done doing it now and I step back and that's what a perfect person does but the weird irony is that a lot of perfect people don't they
2138720	2168720	don't tend to get that pin out interesting thing though that you know we all think of ourselves as underdogs and we I think we all look at other people like I can look around the room right now and your strangers and your eye contact like you like like that's another person like I don't know what their thing is they might they're thinking I paid ten dollars for this yeah this is like sitting with my brother sleeping on my couch and just complaining about it
2168720	2198720	but we all cast ourselves underdogs but like it's interesting to find out that we freak ever we like Spencer like what like you'd be freaked out to find out that you're there was a show and Dan was talking about like like he's a better writer than me like like you're a genius you're half his age like like it's weird to find out that we all look up to each other that we all look at other human beings and go oh that person there's a weird sparkle in their eye there's a way a tilt of their head that
2198720	2228720	they go I wish I could do that too we all fucking we all aspire to other people and if we could all be and I think that's that superhero wish that superpower wish we all look around and go I wish I could like sit as tall as that guy and I wish I could be as sexy as her and I wish I could like I like I wish I wish I could do that dumb thing with my face that that guy does all the time I wish I could I wish I could like I had the balls to wear that shirt where you from my sympathies
2228720	2258720	you're the shittiest Don Rickles of all time but Don Rickles will walk out and he would make fun of every race but think it's somehow it was uplifting because the idea is that because most of the races were actively oppressed and couldn't do anything about it because it's all arbitrary all racism is such a fucking completely arbitrary arrow thrown at nothing and we're all we are is afraid of other people looking at us and everything is a mirror and it's very interesting to look at like I
2258720	2288720	could give any advice to anybody surround yourself with heroes and beer like live your life around people that you look up to that are smarter than you if you're the smartest person in your group of friends you have a bad group of friends you should be intimidated by your significant other you should be you should look up to her or him and we should all be working with people that are better at the things we want to be good at but it's amazing to find out that you who has the show and has community and has the stuff that really like
2288720	2318720	you have an incredibly low self opinion mixed with an incredibly high self opinion and that's a chicken or the egg kind of thing like like is it self love or self loathing that begets the other one but it's crazy to find out that like we're all really really concerned that we're worthless yeah you think that would unify us why we're all here this show is a unification of people who want to find out that it's okay to feel worth
2318720	2348720	us because we're not we all we I think that's what like a lot of and I hate to use the word nerd but like nerd culture geek culture intellectual culture is a bunch of people like I've been kicked around a lot but I'm pretty sure that I'm doing it just as good as I can and like we think about it more the you know the the unexamined life is a life not worth living who said that like like we're people who think about it too much
2348720	2378720	fucking garbage like we're a roomful of people who have the stakes are high we actually care about how the world perceives us I think the people that are the bullies the people that are the jocks the people that are the dominant you know the people that are in Congress dicking around our country and our Constitution and all over the world there do not there are people who do not consider what they fucking look like I think they think that
2378720	2408720	by bullshitting around the room all day long that they're doing it just right I think well they don't I mean this is the thing about the the the you know the archetype of the old white man in the suit that controls everything and owns everything I think the thing that makes that archetype of villain is the is the one missing ingredient where that person doesn't do that thing that doesn't say I'm doing this by the way because I'm really concerned that if I didn't do it I would be worthless it just seems like such a crime to me like I'm coming from this place
2408720	2438720	on the hungry hungry hippo arena like like like my my my hippo comes from the place of because that game's all about what what what angle you're coming in on that was a horrible metaphor it's horrible if you're born in the after 1982 my my my my battle bot is designed around the principle that if you are sincere if you're transparent then you're gonna have a ton of problems you're gonna constantly be made fun of people are gonna be going like
2438720	2468720	what what did you just say you're not allowed to be specific you just hurt my feelings you're punished for being you just said it wrong you just did this and that you and you you do that that's fucked up you're gonna have to you're gonna have to deal with that go through that and I think maturity for the transparent person is like you have to deal with it your transparency if it includes like an image of you having your feelings hurt because you're so transparent is not true transparency it's a it's a it's another stained glass window with you as a saint and it's and it's
2468720	2492560	your
2493200	2500160	you're cursed with being an intellectual like and i hate that's a stupid word it's tough it
2500160	2506080	can be rough but the thing is like well like if you think about things things are fucking tough
2506800	2512800	like the you know the the Odyssey like Homer like there's stories about heroes they didn't
2512800	2517040	think a lot they just went out and they fought dragons and they did shit but like later on as
2517040	2521760	life goes on we become intellectualized and we think about everything too much we become crippled
2521920	2526880	which is why we've created a new character at Harman town that we're going to introduce right now
2526880	2534480	called uh johnny jackhammer the man in the street uh let's go get johnny johnny jackhammer
2537120	2542800	let's open the window and talk down to him hey johnny jackhammer what are you doing down there

2567360	2574000	um uh this is johnny jackhammer obama or uh or uh clinton hey hey they're all a bunch of guys
2574000	2581680	that don't know how to jackhammer that's all i'm saying that's true that's true i say hey you know
2581680	2587360	when i say take two of these guys these congressmen or whatever you give them each a jackhammer
2587360	2592880	whoever can tear up more street that's who gets my vote you know ah you know what that's some
2592960	2600400	that's some blue collar wisdom right sometimes things aren't as complicated as we as we burden
2600400	2607840	ourselves with thinking johnny jackhammer everybody oh oh one more thing you know we should build a
2607840	2613760	wall around the country because fuck everyone that ain't white oh shit god damn it johnny johnny
2613760	2619680	johnny no god damn it he was so close to being our will rogers johnny johnny just get in the
2619760	2632320	car i hate black people oh johnny oh johnny god damn it i thought we found a hero

2668160	2672560	and just flipped and hit a gas station which as we all know is full of gas
2673520	2680480	and will explode on impact you know why because johnny didn't think of himself as an underdog
2680480	2685920	he yeah no he in his head he still had one little secret yeah he put himself above other races and
2685920	2690560	that's the biggest crime you can commit yeah yeah i think that's where bigotry comes from the idea
2690560	2695920	that you can exert your will over other people whereas i think we all come in low we're punished
2695920	2701680	for coming underneath other people you know right we're not punished for we're rewarded for right

3572960	3581440	secret and uh if i told everybody no one here fucking dry cleans anything if i ooh i like the
3581440	3586000	fact that if i walk in there and i say and they say when do you need this and i give them a little
3586000	3592000	like little look and they go come back at five and if i told the whole world that that might
3592000	3597120	infringe my ability to get my shit right when i want it i just don't think that they don't use
3597200	3601920	caustic chemicals i think they definitely do uh yeah look it's called dry cleaning which is uh
3603200	3607440	a misnomer there's certainly liquids involved and yes there are chemicals involved but they make
3607440	3616160	poisons uh spencer will you describe the uh a monster in a dungeon called the the caustic dry
3616160	3626080	cleaner okay okay sweeping aside hundreds of pressed suits you see it in a sink full of
3626080	3634560	bubbling pinks and blues spilled plastic bottles you see a rising and falling surface of caustic
3634560	3642000	boiling bubbling fluids that's all i don't know didn't really build anywhere
3644720	3650320	i didn't deserve that thanks guys i mean there's a way yeah i mean look i i've chosen my life and
3650320	3655920	it suits and uh i i spend a lot of money in dry cleaning and i do you have a suit brush
3655920	3660480	because here's what i'm getting i don't have a suit brush you get a super suit brush you you
3660480	3665520	brush your suit down after you wear it you press it yourself you know you don't have to clean that
3665520	3670400	except for it's every five times can you uh take a vacation off of my cock for five seconds
3672000	3676880	i just i just admire a good suit you know and i don't i don't want to see him shredded by
3676960	3682320	some you know poison i've i've i've had this suit for six years and it's never shown a uh
3683040	3693920	like a dimple i don't know so tired okay how many suits do you do you have spencer you i have three
3696160	3699200	will you wear a suit next time in ten i mean if you guys want
3699840	3707120	well yeah i wonder if they fit i don't wear them very often why do you have three suits because
3707120	3713680	most men have one or two yeah one of them is a real suit two of them are like uh i want to say
3713680	3718720	well's fargo suit but i mean goodwill suit which i don't know that doesn't make any sense they're
3718720	3726240	brought to you on a covered wagon yeah like goodwill suits and stuff right yeah and uh do
3726320	3731520	you wear these ever no i mean you just ask how many i have that's how many three my weight
3731520	3736880	fluctuates so much and i'm so old that like every time i have to wear a suit for like a wedding
3736880	3740720	that's why you get a suit you get over my closet and there's just this there's a bunch of dry
3740720	3746560	cleaning bags because god knows when like and there's like they're always mixed up and like
3746560	3751360	like i have to i have to do this humiliating thing where i get out each pair of pants i they're all
3751360	3755840	gray they're all charcoal gray that i can't tell the difference between any of them except like oh
3755840	3759840	this one was from when i was twice as fat as i am now this one was from i was twice as thin as i
3759840	3766160	am now it's like terrible like but my advice is uh uh it's not good advice but it's my advice uh
3766160	3773040	is to for gentlemen to buy a really expensive suit at your optimum weight and it will form meaning
3773040	3776880	like meaning like you're thinnest you're best you're fighting weight you're college weight
3776880	3781680	like i get down to a good weight get a suit have it tailored make it fit you and then it will force
3781760	3786800	you like i want to wear that suit in fucking two weeks because it's thanksgiving or whatever
3786800	3792160	and you and you go like i like i can't let the suit out five inches if that was going to motivate
3792160	3802000	i i see what you're that's clever but before before the ability to wear a suit would motivate
3802000	3810160	me to lose weight not looking like a monster would motivate me like like like like nudity
3810160	3814640	is that suit you're talking about should be like i should like see myself brushing my teeth
3814640	3821280	and go i don't want that to happen again and yet mcdonald's is delicious a suit is designed to make
3821280	3827280	men look good as as as our dresses for women as our stockings and things like we like men have
3827280	3832480	their their fetish where where guys look good in suits even if you're not in perfect shape
3833120	3837680	that's what tailors are for you go buy a nice italian suit if you're if you're a little bit
3837680	3842400	overweight and you look like fucking marcella mustrigani all of a sudden and uh and and the
3842400	3848080	thing is go to fucking banana republic buy 150 suit or do they have those 200 i don't know
3848080	3853280	and and then and then go spend 30 dollars at a tailor and you have a fuck off suit but you have
3853280	3858480	to stay at that weight because or you have to have 900 suits depending on how many donuts you've
3858480	3866000	eaten that way i don't know whereas bill has just chosen the uh the gay magician look which i think
3866000	3871120	is fantastic that's just it felt like he just lashed out at you at the end for no reason
3871840	3876000	thanks man if you know if i had more courage i would i would i would be dressed as as a sexy
3876000	3880080	vegas magician at all times i think you look like a very straight magician bill i thought it was
3880080	3886240	disenfranchised goth kid but do you do you know do you know any magic tricks bill bill do you do
3886240	3893920	any magic i can make my self disappear you can make your dis self disappear uh you're you're a
3893920	3899440	goth kid yeah a little bit yeah a little bit what was your uh what was your band in school sisters
3899440	3905360	of mercy oh yeah i can see that drummer right oh that's right we talked about that that's right
3905360	3910000	i love it we learned more about he became beef beef steak bill you notice i haven't called you
3910000	3916000	beef fungus bill since i appreciate that you're reborn i really appreciate that i like i like i
3916080	3923600	like growth i just don't like it on my beef no funny thing though so i've been playing this
3923600	3930800	ipad game i've been playing this ipad game called uh plague incorporated you know you do like bacteria
3930800	3938400	and then uh virus and then fungus i can't beat the fungus level i'm not kidding too yeah you're
3938400	3942560	like breffi with spiders i i i think i'm psychologically blocked on that one somehow
3943360	3950480	all right speaking of breffi with spiders where were we in dnd oh where were you i'll tell you that
3952880	3958560	paint a really good picture because i i was interrupted at work so i i know how that is
3965040	3966160	so bill where are you born
3966160	3976480	where are you from bill indiana indiana where fort wane portland fort wane fort wane or fort lame
3976480	3982320	as we call fort lame look what time it is it's uh northeast from india no place 9 11
3984080	3987760	bill we were talking earlier about uh what we fear other people seeing us uh what what's your
3987760	3992080	fear that people see in you or what's your desire that you what's the thing you want people to see
3992080	3996320	and respect in you intelligence intelligence yeah i think it's probably a commonality in this
3996320	4004320	group i would say right spencer you yeah like i mean being right there's a difference between
4004320	4009200	being perceived as intelligence and just being like someone who's right about stuff like i don't
4009200	4014400	want to like come off as being correcty or like i just want if someone asked me a question i want
4014400	4020640	to be the one with the right answer yeah that's because i was going to say what a weird thing for
4020720	4024480	a bunch of bunch of smart people to be worried about their intelligence which is so often the
4024480	4029280	case such as personality type of the internet is a bunch of people like going like no no correction
4029280	4035040	point of order i'd like to spot you in that well i'd like to overspock you in that um well it's
4035040	4039120	because there's like five thousand definitions of intelligence like some people want to be
4040000	4044080	you know like i don't i don't want anyone to think that i went to harvard quite the contrary i want
4044080	4048640	people to think that i'm an autodidact i want people to i want people to think that i'm you
4048720	4053440	know a man of the people but other but other than i'm smart about it you know you can split that
4053440	4060400	hair so many different ways i my my biggest fear in the world is uh is is pretentiousness
4060400	4067200	like that is the the the concept that i'm wrong about myself that is the that is my biggest
4067200	4072800	nightmare is is somebody saying you think you're this but really you're this like that's the most
4072800	4077600	hurtful thing you think you think you're six feet tall you've been four feet tall this whole time
4077680	4083920	like like like mentally or in any way like you think that like like you're so fucking off
4083920	4088320	oh man you're the fear is what what's the worst version of you that people might think that you
4088320	4093440	are like you you think you're what what would you like people to think that you are what version of
4093440	4100160	you a humanitarian decent and then you're you're afraid that people might think you are disgusting
4100160	4108720	caustic uh selfish uh monster which i know that i that's why i celebrate that you know i go like
4108720	4118000	oh i'm a disgusting caustic isn't it possible to be both uh i hope so right i mean isn't there it's
4118000	4122640	like you can recognize that it's possible to be both of those things like you're on a good day
4122640	4127200	you're this and a bad day you're that but it doesn't take one one's not taken away from the other
4127200	4132480	right right well i would think at the same time you could be both things like Han Solo has no love
4132480	4138480	for the empire but he is also not going to be duped in by any kind of cause necessarily he doesn't
4138480	4144880	want to he doesn't want to be tricked into giving his life for some bullshit but he's he cares
4144880	4149600	about people you want people to think you're a humanitarian well i guess i guess i'm just
4149600	4154320	grabbing at that word like like what word would you grab i don't know like i want people to
4154320	4159600	understand that i'm like first and foremost i'm a big fan of our species you want to be a
4159600	4165440	contributor yeah and i also but also that i'm like i'm kind of an optimist that i that i that
4165440	4171200	i think we can do better that i that i that i'm that i'm a champion of of of all of us that i'm
4171200	4176640	not like that archetype of the troll under the bridge who's just like who would slit your throat
4176640	4181680	if he could get away with it just because he he doesn't feel as loved you know like i don't want
4181680	4187360	to be that contribute to that cycle i want to be i want to be known as a person that said
4188240	4192000	uh we can do better i believe in us i think we can do it
4197040	4202480	yeah and and you can you can be that person and also when you're in a when you get cornered you
4202480	4207920	can be a pessimist you can like you can be like i think uh kermudgens and cynics are people that
4208000	4211840	are the most optimistic people in the world like kermudgeon reads because you look around and you
4211840	4216640	go what the fuck are we doing we're being idiots kermudgens are people whose whose hope was abused
4216640	4222240	whose hope was disappointed and so you can be both of those things you you can be a a pessimistic
4222240	4226480	optimist you can you can do both of those right bill what's what's the version of intelligence
4226480	4236800	that you want people to perceive in you cocksmanship i'll just go with that um that's kind of a
4237920	4242960	can you i don't know i mean that was that was saying there's a hundred ways to be intelligent
4242960	4248160	or to be like versions of intelligence is there a certain way i wanted to say on the bottom of the
4248160	4254640	statue that's dedicated to you as a as a as a thinker so like but he used his brain to
4256960	4263280	wit would be great if i if i felt like i had an incisive wit i would be very happy
4264000	4268720	that's a ballsy answer yeah it's very ballsy because that's that's potentially embarrassing
4268720	4275760	to say i wish i was witty wish i were witty
4279440	4282720	i think it's better my fears that people don't think i know the subjective
4285440	4289760	no that's good i mean that's uh that's that's that's very sincere and honest
4289760	4294320	to just go like i would i i hope that people think i'm i have uh i have a way anybody else
4294320	4298800	out there they have a brand of intelligence or a certain kind of genre that they wish people
4298800	4302800	perceived in them i know i know that's like no one's gonna raise their hand but that's like
4303600	4306560	people start shouting off like like eight different things and then one person when
4306560	4312880	you listen to a recording one person went child murder totally pretentious you want people to
4312880	4317840	think you're totally pretentious i like reading classics oh see you want to be perceived as
4317840	4324320	fancy as erudite or uh yeah i like vergil and obed and built-ins and yeah yeah you're pretentious
4324320	4332080	i love that there's a hand back there too yes same as dan actually which is what just being for
4332080	4337440	the betterment of i don't know humanity as a whole and being seen as someone who's or who doesn't
4337440	4342320	ever want to contribute to anyone having your back come up and say that's good you should
4343200	4344800	i'll bring the mic to you then
4348640	4352480	i don't want to lose your bacon for you no no now i'm fully gonna forget exactly what
4352480	4354080	yeah but it's a hard thing to utter
4362800	4367760	no i mean mainly it's just that i never want to contribute to
4367760	4374960	sounds so cheesy but anyone ever having a bad day or thinking less of humanity because of me
4374960	4380560	yeah i don't want to be the reason why anybody ever is going like shit yeah people now that's
4380560	4385440	all fucked lately which is so ironic because i'm so often the reason but but then so then
4385440	4391120	i have to think well that person's a bad person like i i don't want to be i so much fear like
4391120	4396640	somebody saying god damn it uh this room would be so much better if that person would leave
4397280	4403440	like i won't allow that to happen i will not be the unwelcome guest i will not to the point where
4403440	4407840	i would cut my own face i would like i would i would i would jump out of a skylight i would
4407840	4413680	i would i would i would blow up the fucking building before i went to it that might cause
4413680	4418720	people a bad day but it's possible to want that and then and do that very same thing right like
4418720	4423680	you can want to not do that and then that's why and then do it a lot yeah yeah because you're
4423680	4426960	like you're like let's get one thing straight i'm not the fucking reason you're gonna have a bad
4426960	4432000	time if you want your money back i'd give you your money back fuck you um i want to make you
4432000	4437520	feel good about yourself you fucking cock sucking piece of shit and i didn't ask you to come here
4437520	4444080	and i don't fuck at you i meant humanity not you yeah that's a big that's that's my thing haley
4444080	4452080	it was haley everybody thank you now i wanted to be the reason why that's a big thing like when
4452080	4456080	somebody when somebody implies somebody goes like you that's that's the like like somebody
4456080	4460320	goes you you hurt me you hurt me because you were talking you hurt me because you said that thing
4460320	4467600	like i just like fucking hulk see an enemy like like weird toxins fill my blood and prepare me
4467600	4477360	for battle ironically because if if that's true if i said something that made you suffer we have
4477360	4483600	to figure this out if i if i have to pound your face into the earth and change the axis of the
4483600	4490720	planet i will prove that i you are wrong i did not say something to ruin your day or that your day
4490720	4496320	needed to be ruined and then i actually helped you or anything anything but that's kind of what
4496320	4501760	happened last episode wasn't it that's what has been happening for 40 years that's what i was
4501760	4507120	trying to explain in the heat of that moment i was like look this is this is my thing this is
4507120	4514480	why i make stuff we got one more jim i think actually um kind of what dan is trying to describe
4514480	4520720	is what i would call emotional intelligence right yeah there's actually a book about that by a guy
4520720	4527440	named uh daniel goleman but there's a lot of of you know psycho analysis involved but it's
4527440	4531200	i would call it emotional intelligence for sure thank you for projecting to the point where you
4531200	4535920	probably don't have to have you uh but you know and you know what it might be a fear of like this
4535920	4540960	thing like like i i've been mistaken for diagnosing myself with aspergers and i i'm sorry
4540960	4550400	that that ever happened i would not do that um but like the idea of empathy like like i from talking
4550400	4558960	to people on the spectrum like what i find is that the thing that unites those people is the
4558960	4564800	feeling of frustration because they find themselves in situations where they are the cause of everyone's
4564800	4570560	despair and they find out all too late that they have not participated in some misperceived social
4570560	4575600	custom they have their underwear around their ankles at the urinal in kindergarten they uh
4575600	4580000	they're whole they have a booger on their finger on the playground they're saying words backwards
4580000	4584240	they're they're they're they're not doing something right that they didn't even know
4584240	4590080	they weren't even picking up on having to do right until and what they do pick up on is a circle of
4590080	4594080	people around them with their fingers in their face saying you don't belong here you have to get
4594080	4601840	off the playground get out of here and like that phobia like that that would that's the thing
4601840	4608640	that would result in somebody like auto correcting uh in their adult life for making sure that
4608640	4615680	everyone understands that you know i'm here to help i'm here to uh i'm here to make sure
4615680	4622000	everybody feels better about themselves i'm not trying to hurt you when i talk what what
4622000	4627440	dan in your storytelling you've probably said this before but like say it again like in your
4627440	4633600	storytelling what would be the goal that you could like help people with what's the point of stories
4633600	4638160	what's the point of uh watching people walk through the stories and be punished for their
4638160	4643680	humanity get through it become heroes because of it like what's what's what's the uh the gift
4644720	4649920	well everybody everybody realizing that life is uh life is what it is it's just the most basic
4650000	4655520	thing in the world it's like we when you wake up in the morning there seems to be so much uh wrong
4656960	4666640	and stories are the things that we tell each other to uh let us know that um that all these
4666640	4671920	things that you feel uh about about how fucked up everything is like that that's actually
4672800	4680960	that is how it is so that it resonates so that you go like because every you you providing language
4680960	4686000	for the things that are bouncing around in your head that's what art is that's if you look at a
4686000	4692320	painting you know in the lube and you start to burst into tears it's because you somebody like
4692320	4699520	put something on a canvas that you thought could only ever exist in your brain or a brain and you
4699520	4705120	suddenly like burst into tears because you've been connected with and it's but it for me story
4705120	4715040	is a is a is the remo williams tapping on the wrist of like it's such a deep cut um of of like like
4715040	4722960	like i'm tapping in the rhythm of life and death with you so that you understand that when you woke
4722960	4727600	up this morning and you felt bipolar you felt like why am i in a good mood but i'm in a bad mood
4727600	4732240	why if i was in a good mood why did i listen to a sad song why why why why is my mom's death
4732240	4737920	the thing that's fucking up my job right now uh why why why do i hate the people i love why do i
4737920	4744080	love the people i hate why why am i depressed why can't i get anything done why why am i different
4744080	4749840	why why am i scared like like like everyone's walking around in their pizza hut uniforms and
4749840	4753200	they're up and down the sidewalk and they all seem to have their shit together and i turn on
4753200	4757680	the tv and everyone's having certain counters and trying on high-heeled shoes and they everyone
4757680	4762560	seems to know what's going on ross and rachel know what's going on and all the all the traffic
4762560	4765680	lights and every once in a while you drive by and like a couple cars hit each other and there's
4765680	4768960	broken glass everywhere which you're not supposed to look and everyone that does look as a bad person
4768960	4774240	need to keep going this conveyor belt this concrete jungle it puts a pressure on you and you feel like
4775280	4779600	because you have this turmoil in your brain you're like i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna fucking i'm
4779600	4784000	gonna snap i i'm the only one walking around with the secret that we're all fucked up that
4784000	4793600	everything is going to hell and and stories like you know let you know no ulysses had that happen
4793600	4800000	to him he felt that way he he went to this place and like that that there's a it's a way of
4800000	4805200	articulating that inarticulable fact that just when things feel their worst that is actually the
4805200	4809920	thing that is giving you the most strength and all that kind of crap it did for for me like like
4809920	4814560	community stories are always about people versus the system and it's always about reminding you
4814560	4821280	that no matter how fucked up you feel you you're supposed to be the way you are you're not supposed
4821280	4826400	to actually grow and change you're you're you're supposed to actually before we ever get to that
4826400	4832400	point you're first and foremost the most subversive most heroic act you can do is just be proud of
4832400	4837520	yourself the way you got out of bed that morning that's and people go around the uh the circle of
4837520	4841600	those stories like experimenting with the idea that maybe they can improve themselves for the
4841600	4846640	sake of of of improving their life or the system they get they get improved like we said before
4846640	4850800	they get improved by the people around them that that they look up to they come back around to the
4850800	4853760	conclusion that they should have just come clean and been honest about the fact that they felt
4853760	4860240	like a piece of shit yeah uh that's that's what stories are to answer your question for god's sake
4860240	4864240	let's uh let's play some dnd for pity's sake shall we all right
4869920	4876640	last time our heroes were firing breff were fighting with breffi the mechanical monstrosity
4876640	4883200	who was new and improved with powerful enhancements breffi shot lasers and lightning and also tiny
4883200	4889840	robo spiders but quark quickly leapt into action narwhaling the spider creature with a dagger
4889840	4896560	strapped to his face sharpie used his father's cape to teleport onto the beast's back and blasted
4896560	4903280	it with electricity breffi hit krista burg with a chain which stuck in his stomach mulrein fired
4903280	4909520	arrow after arrow at the spider monster with a decent success rate quark changed tactics and
4909520	4914560	slashed at the beast with his mighty great sword while sharpie began looking through his backpack
4914560	4920160	he retrieved a rod of frost and sprayed ice at the lava below forming a cool crust then the
4920160	4925440	wizard turned his rod on the spider blasting it in the face with razor sharp ice fragments
4925440	4931440	that finished the job and sent breffi crashing down onto the lava crust below quark overtaken
4931440	4937520	by victory lust lowered himself down by rope onto breffi but slipped and fell if not for quick or
4937520	4941920	sharpie's quick thinking and the button staff quark wouldn't have lived to rape another day
4941920	4950240	and world dark star was sure to be close but just how close i don't know i don't know
4951920	4952720	thank you spencer
4959760	4963840	so you guys are up in this web of chains after just killing this guy
4964880	4969520	there's lava beneath you i said we climb up and see if there's a some sort of door where breffi came
4969520	4975440	through yeah one thing to note is that there are four statues with eyes that recess when you press
4975440	4982480	the button yeah those are uh consumed by lava at this point that's been steadily rising this whole
4982480	4991920	time you guys are now just in the chains and there's only lava below yeah bill oh oh that
4992240	4999920	you noticed sorry that's in lava now get in the moment i climb up the chains and start looking for
5000560	5006640	outlets above us on the ceiling there's a sort of metal hatch door but there doesn't seem to be any
5006640	5011840	kind of handle or knob on it it looks like it's made out of several triangular sections
5012720	5020000	krista burguro get up there and uh check it out i'm checking it out checking it out you see what
5020080	5026800	looks like a small hole on the left side of one of these door panels there's a hole
5028400	5035920	i fuck it i knew he was going to do that no don't do that um did we find anything lately uh
5037120	5042800	rods stabs fingers we have a crafting kit that we could borrow from mulrane yeah but don't you
5042800	5046400	think this is one of those things where there's like uh i'm sorry i'm immersed i'm not metagaming
5046480	5050080	we could uh jam an arrow you say is there something that we have that would fit that
5050080	5053440	certain size hole yeah i mean we play this game once a week and we're always drunk i'm just
5053440	5058160	wondering if what's the size like this describe the size of the uh the hole by the door it's smaller
5058160	5063200	than um a human's littlest finger i don't know how that compares to a half length one
5064960	5072000	i'm gonna grab an arrow and and uh jam it up in there all right you jam it in there real hard
5072080	5078160	but uh the arrow is like harder i mean it's it's wider than the hole so you stab it in there and
5078160	5084480	it kind of breaks off the stone bits of the stone arrow this is a stone arrow in this instance in
5084480	5089200	case anyone's wondering it's not one of those iron tipped arrows that wouldn't break off in this
5089200	5094880	instance uh just some continuity you know these triangular things are they are they are they are
5094880	5100160	they clean triangles or are they like shard of power kind of shit like cream clean triangles
5100160	5105760	like there's like tooth like teeth of a not not of a thing that's all of its teeth come together
5107360	5113840	nothing exists like that in nature uh you haven't met my ex-wife anyway
5115440	5121280	so christopher is jamming this arrow in and you jam it in and you feel you feel like uh
5121280	5126720	a thing that it hits as you as you stick it in it felt like it hit like a little metal or something
5126720	5135920	um now what they'd hit a metal something in the hole it hit the metal something deep deep stuff
5135920	5141520	and it broke off so is it stuck in there it's not like broken off it's just that the tips the side
5141520	5148320	of the arrow is broken off it's still attached all right well uh i'm gonna turn it try to
5148320	5157520	uh i was gonna all right i'll turn it turning it with all your strength you muster up not very
5157520	5164000	much of all your strength i guess and you try and turn it and it just doesn't budge it's like a rotary
5164000	5167920	phone what were you gonna do you're you're the barbarian you're at the strength yeah you
5169680	5176240	grab onto the arrow shaft and i turn it for all i'm worth you turn it for all your worth and it
5176240	5183360	snaps off but not before activating some sort of mechanism that grinds deep within this assembly
5183360	5191600	of triangles they sort of grind and rumble as they open apart and create a hole in the ceiling
5192560	5201760	yay yay as long as nothing's coming out of the hole yeah all right it's coming out of the hole
5201760	5209280	let's get through this hole man yeah i i i i clamor up through the hole you scramble up clamor
5209280	5217520	i i'm i'm using scramble otherwise i'd just be copying you but uh you can i trundle you can
5217520	5225520	trundle or you could sashay i'll clamor i don't care about copying all right i'm mosey is anyone
5225520	5231680	else gonna move and i chatter wall okay but then i then i move actually through i think
5233280	5240880	you all move in various specific ways and find yourself in a new room this room is strangely
5240880	5248560	dark as if light were magically dampened however the magically dampened light does not extend to
5248560	5254720	dim crimson flames that seem to be held up in the mid-air like they're floating or some
5254720	5262080	shit it's crazy it's not crazy it's just magic the floor is littered with the mangled corpses
5262080	5268320	of several black roped humanoids and also black buckets for whatever reason you can see entrails
5268320	5273760	and blood smeared across the floor and in the center of the carnage carnage is a mound of ashes
5274640	5280800	across the room on the arch across the room you can see an archway in the archway is a stairwell
5280800	5288080	how high in the air are these flames floating i like about seven feet tall like you could
5288080	5294400	probably grab one i use my goggles with my newt seeing you use your goggles of minute seeing
5294400	5305200	what do you look at with them the room everything you look around at everything and you look at
5305200	5310080	these corpses they look like they've been ripped apart somehow um some of them have bite marks on
5310160	5315680	them but none of them look like sliced or like stabbed or anything more torn
5317600	5328000	not pleasant also the buckets they're full of blood seems a bit much yeah do i detect any traps
5330720	5336480	searching around for traps you see no traps okay yeah we should go look at that archway
5336480	5342080	on the far side of the room where the stairwell i was mentioning mentioning earlier was you hear
5342080	5348320	footsteps and then you see uh that knoll guy yurch that you've seen before in random circumstances

6071280	6077920	oh damn poisonous sneak attack what's up poisonous sneak attack i like the sound of that
6078400	6084560	uh going around to his flank in a flanking maneuver you try to attack him right in the

6161200	6168240	oh well i don't think it's the one with the mustache that's that's clearly fake oh it would
6168240	6173520	be weird if i just put on a mustache and then cast a spell so that i was the one with the mustache
6176480	6182240	and then i laugh and each ha comes from a different guy ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
6184800	6190160	so yurch dives on the to the ground and he grabs one of these buckets and he does like a weird
6190400	6197120	roll and he throws a bucket on on quarks and how quarks covered in blood what yeah that's not good

6220000	6230960	way done that's all uh ribbon dagger okay you attack him with your ribbon dagger yeah just making
6230960	6238720	sure that's a critical hit oh you strike him directly between the blood
6238720	6252240	dealing seven damage that's yeah you know ribbon dagger does x4 damage but still just
