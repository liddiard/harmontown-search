24000	26000	Welcome to heart of town
26000	30000	Oh, really?
30000	36000	If you were high and this happened to you, you'd be like, what?
36000	41000	Let's get started, we should make everybody speak to this
41000	42000	What?
42000	45000	It's not about getting everybody to speak to this
45000	48000	Let's make Spencer Cranton speak to that microphone
48000	50000	Ladies and gentlemen, Spencer Cranton
50000	53000	You know him, you love him

112000	116000	MC St. Patrick's Day
116000	120000	MC St. Patrick's Day
120000	124000	March 31st every day
124000	128000	Even though it's after May
128000	132000	I'm so Irish
132000	138000	Oh, yeah
138000	140000	This is, uh, right
140000	143000	He's on the floor
146000	148000	Okay
148000	150000	Thanks for coming downtown tonight
150000	152000	Yeah
156000	159000	I'm decked out in
160000	163000	Shrobs activating the Votron
163000	167000	I'm decked out in sponsor
167000	168000	Uh, ship
168000	170000	Who sent us those, Dan?
170000	173000	This is a Miwanzi that I'm wearing
173000	175000	Miwanzi's
175000	177000	Come on, man, I mean, what the...
177000	178000	What?
178000	179000	What's wrong?
179000	181000	He's trying again
181000	183000	Do you want people to be able to understand me?
183000	185000	I can understand you
185000	187000	I can't, I don't know if they can understand me
188000	190000	Who can't understand what he's saying?
190000	192000	Yeah
192000	194000	We don't know what that means
194000	196000	I just wanted to see it work
196000	199000	I've been gone a while, did you notice?
199000	201000	Yeah
201000	203000	Yeah, I did
203000	205000	The view is amazing
209000	212000	You'll see a four-leaf clover in front of you?
213000	215000	Should I point at it?
216000	219000	Oh, that's not nice
219000	221000	What's wrong with you?
221000	223000	We can't be doing that
223000	225000	This is awful
225000	227000	You're an awful person
227000	229000	Paid for his Uber
229000	231000	Maybe that's why that happened
231000	233000	You know, he got to earn it
233000	237000	Even though I did, I did tell him to do it as well
238000	240000	Just go in
240000	242000	Backstage
242000	244000	Discussing mic gags
245000	247000	I hate him, I hate him so much
248000	250000	I'm wearing a M1Z
250000	252000	And I'm
254000	257000	The shop put its mic in a mug
258000	260000	And I'm drinking out of
262000	263000	What is it called?
263000	265000	Brumate brand drinkwear
265000	269000	B-R-U with an umlaut M-A-T-E
269000	272000	Hey, Brumate is the drinkwear for me
272000	275000	Guys, why is that a different type of drinkwear?
275000	280000	Because Brumate keeps drinks at the perfect temperature
280000	282000	Whatever that is
282000	284000	That's the one it does
284000	287000	Which I suppose is like context-aware
287000	291000	So, the first AI-powered drinkwear
293000	297000	Yeah, I guess I put some ice in it backstage and it's not melted yet
297000	299000	Yeah
300000	303000	I do like that they disguised it as a piece of wood
303000	305000	Yeah, it's like a little baby coconut
305000	307000	It does look very nice
307000	309000	Alright, well
309000	311000	There's not a lot to talk about
311000	313000	I did have an epiphany
313000	317000	If you wanted to run somebody against Trump just to beat Trump
317000	319000	Which I don't think is the right philosophy
319000	322000	I think we should vote our conscience and just let them win
323000	325000	And just focus on the Senate
325000	327000	I mean, I just don't know how you're gonna
328000	332000	We, and by we I mean every non-Nazi
332000	334000	We're a divided people
334000	337000	And we should be, you know who's united? Nazis
337000	338000	It's easy
338000	340000	You just go like, oh, I love that uniform
340000	341000	It's fine
341000	343000	You don't have to
343000	345000	And they can be like, well, are you a gay Nazi?
345000	346000	You can be like, yeah
346000	349000	And they're like, come on in, just pretend you're not gay
349000	351000	And you can be like, okay, yeah, it's fine
351000	352000	It's easy
352000	356000	That's what we're fighting when we fight autocracy
356000	358000	We fight whatever we perceive as the bad guys
358000	361000	So, of course, the toughest times you're gonna be divided
361000	363000	You're not gonna win the election
363000	365000	And I'm not gonna talk about politics for the next two years
365000	368000	Because it's gonna get real ugly with all this primary stuff
368000	370000	We're gonna be, you're gonna, friends are gonna be yelling at each other
370000	372000	It's gonna break my heart
372000	375000	I don't want, it's the worst, it's the worst thing
375000	378000	I kept out of it when we were leading up to the thing
378000	380000	With the Bernies and the Hillarys and stuff
380000	381000	What?
381000	384000	Well, I just, I said nothing, you know, I just said nothing
385000	387000	But one of those sides was wrong
389000	392000	Also, there was a little bit of a shell shock the first time
392000	395000	Right, you know, you were like, Jesus, this is crazy
395000	396000	So you kind of had to talk about it
396000	399000	Whereas now you're like, oh, it's all fucked up still
400000	402000	But even I, look, I mean, I'll talk all day
402000	404000	Went to the, like, for the last two years
404000	406000	I was like, I was like, oh, God, this is awful
406000	408000	Like, to me, it's not even politics
408000	410000	It's just, I was, what am I supposed to do in this show
410000	411000	Except share my life
411000	416000	And if I happen to be obsessed with fucking, oh, God, what's happening
416000	418000	It's like, what do you want me to do?
418000	422000	Pretend I'm interested in frozen pizza for two years
422000	424000	And be like, oh, and it's just like
424000	427000	The only people that want that are
427000	429000	I'm not saying they're bad people, but it's like
429000	430000	I'm not even saying they're wrong
430000	434000	Because I don't want to listen to a year and a half of podcasts
434000	437000	Where I'm, like, so fucking bummed out and freaked out
437000	438000	What are we gonna do?
438000	439000	I don't want to listen to that
439000	441000	But tough titties
441000	445000	If the world is ending, then I'm like, oh, this is what I thought about today
445000	446000	I thought about the world ending
446000	450000	However, because I'm a, you know, I have a lot of anxieties
450000	454000	As I did during the last time, I was like, oh, primaries are gearing up
454000	457000	I was like, there's no way, I'm not touching it
457000	458000	I'm not touching this stuff
458000	460000	Because it's too sad
460000	463000	Because you're talking about people that shouldn't beef with each other
463000	472000	It's like, socialists and, like, watered down, like, liberals shouldn't
472000	476000	Like, they cannot like each other about where to go for breakfast
476000	478000	They shouldn't be, like, tearing each other's throats out
478000	484000	While the guys I perceive as the bad guys are, like, laughing all the way to the fucking victory line
484000	486000	But there's nothing we can do about it
486000	488000	You can't, like, demand that we unite
488000	491000	Because if you could demand that we unite, what are you?
492000	493000	Fascist
495000	498000	Not on it, but it's like, who has the power to do that, you know?
498000	502000	Like, they'd be like, oh, everybody, no matter what you think, lay your shit aside
502000	505000	And, like, so anyways, but this is the one thing I'll say
505000	507000	This is an epiphany, here's who you run against Donald Trump
507000	511000	If you're playing that game where you just want to, like, knock him out
511000	514000	Like, oh, who are we going to run? Liam Neeson, did it
514000	515000	Yeah
515000	516000	Think about it
516000	519000	So you're going to, like, you're going to knock his base in half
519000	522000	Old white guy, so then, like, they're confused
522000	526000	And then he's racist, so they're like, I love it
527000	532000	But he's like, we only know he's racist because he was, like, honest about it
532000	535000	He was like, I used to be racist, and I don't want to be
535000	540000	And then some people are going to be like, well, that's kind of cooler than being secretly racist
540000	545000	Like, and then, like, you would just, like, you would shuffle all the, like, groups, you know
545000	547000	But I think you'd come out on the other side
547000	551000	And he's European, so you'd have to do, like, a reverse birther movement
551000	553000	Like, but that's cool
553000	557000	Like, do that, reverse birther, hashtag reverse birther
557000	560000	You have to be proven where you weren't born
560000	561000	Yeah
561000	562000	Yeah, yeah
562000	565000	He could be like, I'm not Irish, do I sound Irish, do I sound like a
565000	569000	And then he could go on The View and be like, yeah
569000	572000	It doesn't matter if I'm racist
572000	573000	Yeah
573000	576000	It doesn't matter if I'm racist
576000	579000	And people still like him, and they would be like, well, what do we like about it
579000	581000	He could just be like, I don't care if you get an abortion
581000	582000	I don't
582000	584000	It doesn't matter if you get an abortion
584000	587000	I don't care if you get an abortion
587000	589000	You used to do that
589000	590000	You used to
590000	592000	There was an old episode where you were doing, like, Liam Neeson
592000	594000	And you were like, it doesn't matter
594000	598000	It's, like, so minstrel that you're wearing that and doing Liam Neeson
600000	602000	I saw Dan Harmon's podcast
602000	604000	That's not cool
604000	605000	Dan
605000	607000	The IRA is gonna fuck you up
607000	609000	Come on, IRA, don't do that
609000	614000	Dan, do you, I know you have opinions about things
614000	619000	But do you think Spencer has enough cable for the show
620000	623000	I mean, we've got, like, a couple of spools here
623000	627000	I got 3000 series, this is 30 meters of XLR cable
627000	629000	I don't think it's enough, man
629000	631000	I think you need at least
631000	634000	Well, what's the run of this place, like, 50 feet, 60 feet
634000	636000	Let's walk it
636000	638000	Okay, you could do that
638000	640000	I want to sit
640000	643000	Spencer and I accidentally both ordered wolf urine from Amazon
643000	648000	You know when you show up at work and you're both ordering wolf urine
648000	650000	Oh, yeah, mine came
650000	652000	We should open it up and see if it has documentation, huh?
652000	654000	Yeah, go get the wolf urine, yeah
654000	656000	Let me go meet him backstage
656000	658000	I got a park
658000	660000	Also, there's a parking ticket in my jeans
660000	662000	I don't know who's supposed to take care of that
662000	664000	Certainly not me
666000	668000	You're gonna fuck up the show
668000	672000	I kind of, I kind of, it's something you can look forward to
672000	678000	if you ever, like, a little privileged perk
678000	681000	I kind of like, I get a little stoked when I get a park ticket
681000	682000	I'm rich
682000	686000	Because I'm like, what's that? What are you trying to do to me?
686000	689000	Scare me, like, take your fucking valet money
690000	692000	It pays for kids' textbooks
692000	693000	Yeah, I bet
693000	696000	Yeah, I'm sure that money goes right over to someone in need
696000	699000	Fucking, fucking, fucking machine
699000	703000	I try to pay them within, like, 20 minutes of getting them
703000	705000	I'll drive right to the motherfucker
705000	707000	And be like, how's it going? Yeah, uh-huh, here
707000	709000	It does feel like they hate that, right?
709000	710000	They hate it
710000	711000	I guess we're the suckers
711000	712000	They hate it
712000	714000	Because we're, like, so stoked about paying our parking tickets on time
714000	715000	that we think, we're, like, in your face
715000	717000	And they're like, oh, no
718000	721000	But for sure they want you to not pay it right away
721000	723000	It's, like, a poor people trap
723000	725000	Man, I was poor once, you guys
725000	729000	And it was fucking incredible how hard it was
729000	731000	It was like, holy shit, man
731000	734000	They designed the whole system
734000	736000	Don't get so mad that you, like, stormed my house
736000	740000	But, like, I remember getting parking tickets
740000	743000	And being like, okay, well, I have a lot to do today
743000	746000	And I have no assistance, let alone two
746000	748000	And if I did, I don't have
748000	750000	They can't write a check, it'll bounce
750000	752000	And, like, you're just stuck with this thing
752000	754000	I guess I'll pay this sooner or later
754000	756000	You put it in your apartment somewhere
756000	758000	You know that shit's, like, fucking gone
758000	761000	And they expect it to be
761000	764000	That's what they put you on the 21 days
764000	767000	Do you guys know about, there's this Terry Pratchett quote about this
767000	769000	I have it
770000	773000	The reason the rich were so rich was because they spent less money
773000	775000	Take boots, for example
775000	778000	Vyams earned $38 a month plus allowances
778000	781000	A really good pair of leather boots cost $50
781000	784000	But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of okay for a season or two
784000	787000	And leaked like hell when the cardboard came out
787000	789000	Cost about $10
789000	791000	Those were the boots he bought
791000	793000	And wore until the soles were so thin
793000	796000	That he could tell where he was and ink more pork on a foggy night
796000	799000	But the thing is that good boots lasted for years and years
799000	801000	A man who could have poured $50
801000	804000	Had a pair of boots that would be keeping his feet dry in 10 years' time
804000	806000	While the poor man who could only afford cheap boots
806000	808000	Would have spent $100 on boots
808000	811000	In the same time and would still have wet feet
811000	813000	Yeah, I mean
813000	815000	I can upgrade that in a much simpler way
815000	820000	Like, we live in Los Angeles where literally everyone over a certain income gets free shoes
820000	822000	Like, if you work in the industry
822000	824000	Like, at some point you go over to, like, the Nike place
824000	827000	And they give you a duffel bag and you walk around
827000	830000	And, like, you fill your bag with Nike shit
830000	832000	I've never done it
832000	835000	Because I fucking care about you
835000	837000	They never invited me
837000	839000	They never invited me
839000	842000	But I remember when we first moved here from Milwaukee
842000	845000	They called it the Free Shoes for Rich People program
845000	847000	That's what they call it glibly
847000	849000	What was it called?
849000	851000	Free Shoes for Rich People program
851000	853000	Why am I repeating my show for you?
853000	856000	Like, I can't expect you to pay attention
856000	858000	What are you doing back there?
858000	860000	You playing Minesweeper?
861000	863000	No, don't touch my ass
863000	864000	Come on
864000	870000	You know, five years from now people are going to know that that's not cool
870000	873000	Like, it's funny now because we're both dudes or whatever
873000	875000	But five years from now it's going to be like
875000	878000	We were going to have fixed everything but that shit
878000	881000	And you're going to be rounded up, taken into the street, and fucking Weinstein
881000	883000	Boom
883000	885000	And I'm going to laugh
886000	892000	I'm going to write so many brave blogs about what it was like to fucking stand here and silently shudder
897000	903000	That sounded like I was maybe parodying victims
903000	905000	That wasn't my intention
905000	907000	I wasn't like, no, no, I'll do that
907000	909000	Like, those bullshit people do
909000	910000	I'm with you
910000	911000	I'm with you
911000	912000	As an abuser, I've got to be with you
912000	913000	How is it?
913000	914000	What's up?
915000	917000	You tell me, baby
917000	919000	Alright, that would be abuse
919000	921000	I don't want to know
921000	923000	Tell me, tell me
923000	925000	Tell me if I'm sexual, Brandon
925000	927000	Or you're fired
927000	929000	Oh, what a beautiful man
929000	931000	Listen
931000	935000	It's going to be three years before that's not cool
935000	940000	And if I tell you why, two years from now, I'm going to be fired
941000	943000	But is it keeping you warm?
944000	946000	Is it 100% cotton?
946000	949000	No, I think it might be micro-modal
949000	950000	Oh, yeah
950000	952000	It feels about three times softer than cotton
952000	953000	Right
953000	957000	It's breathing, I have a shirt under it
957000	960000	I'm in my unders, my regular meundis
960000	961000	I took my pants off
961000	964000	But I'm not getting overheated, no
964000	966000	You dropped water bottles, sir
967000	968000	He got it
968000	970000	He's cool, don't harass him
970000	971000	He's done nothing wrong
972000	974000	Welcome to the show, sir, I'm very sorry
976000	978000	Liam Neeson, you think it's a good idea?
978000	980000	He's foreign, I can't think
980000	982000	He's foreign, but just suspend your disbelief
982000	986000	Do we just found out Trump's dad's from Germany?
986000	988000	That's got to be unconstitutional
988000	989000	That's not illegal, yeah
989000	990000	That's illegal
991000	995000	What will you spend your time on instead of how do you get away from the politics?
995000	997000	Because it is fascinating
997000	999000	It is crazy the amount of shit that you're not aware of
1000000	1003000	The weird shit that you hear mentioned and you're like, what?
1003000	1005000	Pete Buttigieg?
1005000	1006000	Say what?
1006000	1007000	Like Pete Buttigieg?
1007000	1010000	I heard him mentioned by Dave Klein
1010000	1012000	Have you heard about Pete Buttigieg?
1012000	1014000	I don't know if I'm saying it right, probably not
1014000	1016000	He's a gay veteran, right?
1016000	1017000	Buttigieg
1017000	1018000	Buttigieg?
1018000	1021000	Mayor of a town in Indiana, something like that
1021000	1024000	He seems like a cool person
1024000	1026000	I don't know, he seems like a centrist
1026000	1028000	What does that mean?
1028000	1029000	What, centrist?
1029000	1030000	Yeah
1030000	1031000	What's that mean?
1031000	1033000	It means equivocating to conservatives
1033000	1034000	Equivocated?
1034000	1036000	Yeah, maybe that's the malapod
1036000	1037000	Malapod?
1037000	1039000	That's the heartbreak we're going to go through
1039000	1041000	Oh, I love this guy and the part of your brain is going to be like
1041000	1044000	Do I love him because it feels like he's got a shot?
1044000	1046000	Or do I love him because, yeah
1046000	1049000	Here's what I'm going to do, it's not my advice to anybody
1049000	1053000	I'm just going to look quietly and be like
1053000	1055000	Alright, I'm going to vote for
1055000	1058000	I'm going to vote, I'll vote for somebody, as far as the presidential race
1058000	1061000	I'm just going to pick somebody, even if
1061000	1064000	Even if I think they're going to get like 5,000 votes
1064000	1067000	I'm just going to be like, I'm voting my conscience
1067000	1070000	I guess I have to qualify that though, because even that's an inflammatory statement right now
1070000	1072000	Because you guys are like, how do you know two years from now
1072000	1075000	You're not, look, I guess, okay, I'll lick my finger
1075000	1077000	Put it in the air if it feels like it's a fucking intense
1077000	1079000	If there's somebody that's been picked
1079000	1083000	I'll do what I always do, I'll go up to that one big boulder
1083000	1086000	You know, full disclosure
1086000	1093000	I was doing the Bernie thing until the very moment that the system that's supposed to work
1093000	1096000	You know, said, no, he's done
1096000	1098000	And then I pulled the lever for Hillary
1098000	1101000	And it was like, this is all part of, honestly, it was just me voting for like
1101000	1104000	I don't think this guy's a good idea, I could see that going bad
1104000	1107000	I don't want to have to like serve hemlock tea to ICE agents and stuff
1107000	1110000	But
1110000	1112000	Because you know I'm going to be first
1112000	1116000	You know they round up, and I know you're going like, Dan, what are you saying, you're an intellectual
1116000	1118000	Is that what you're saying?
1118000	1121000	Yeah, compared to, you know, there's a curve here
1121000	1126000	It's like if the emperor can't read, then I qualify as like an academic
1126000	1129000	I'm going to be shot before they pick a group to scapegoat
1129000	1134000	They grab the guys like me first, they grab the hippies and the teachers and the scientists
1134000	1138000	Grab the hippies first, then you
1138000	1143000	So I'm already done, so I'm not trying to do nothing but just like preserve my life
1143000	1146000	The question is, what else are you doing?
1146000	1147000	Like, do you have a
1147000	1148000	I bought a gun
1148000	1149000	No, no, no
1149000	1153000	I mean, I mean, other than
1153000	1155000	Oh, oh, I'm composing a lot of music
1155000	1156000	There you go
1156000	1157000	Yeah
1157000	1158000	Okay
1158000	1159000	Yeah, it makes me very happy
1159000	1161000	Will you take lessons, do you think? Or do you need to?
1161000	1164000	I don't know, I'm not going to rule anything out
1164000	1167000	Do you teach lessons?
1167000	1171000	Because I've got some spare time coming up
1171000	1175000	Do you want to learn to play an instrument? Or do you just want lessons?
1175000	1178000	I just want, I just want lessons
1178000	1181000	I definitely would say that my eyes would be melted by now
1181000	1184000	If I wasn't drinking out of a bloom house, what's it called?
1184000	1185000	Brumate
1185000	1186000	Brumate
1186000	1187000	B-R-U-M-A-T-E
1187000	1188000	B-R-U with moon lots
1188000	1190000	Use the promo code Harmentown
1190000	1191000	Brumate
1191000	1192000	Brumate
1192000	1193000	Brumate
1193000	1194000	It's like your buddy
1194000	1195000	Yeah
1195000	1199000	It sounds like the name of a product that has to do with brooms
1201000	1204000	Oh, it was your broom hungry? No, my broom mate
1204000	1206000	Keith your broom mate
1207000	1209000	For all you dads
1211000	1212000	Yeah
1212000	1215000	I didn't want to do spoilers, but like
1215000	1219000	I am working on this thing on the side, I'm not going to have it on my phone
1219000	1221000	It would be on my iPad, but
1221000	1222000	The Community Movie
1222000	1224000	But there's this kid
1224000	1227000	Did I play this last time? Maybe I didn't, I can't remember
1227000	1229000	No
1229000	1231000	Well, there you go
1231000	1235000	Oh, I forgot, there's no such a weird little signal in here, so
1235000	1236000	No, you didn't
1236000	1238000	Well, this guy
1238000	1241000	This musician dude
1241000	1244000	He remember that song I played
1244000	1246000	I think I talked about this, the song that I played
1246000	1248000	And then at the end of it I was like
1248000	1250000	All my baby ducks
1250000	1252000	There's this guy that he made
1252000	1255000	He did lyrics to it, he did the whole thing
1255000	1257000	And he played a little acoustic guitar
1257000	1260000	And I didn't want to spoil it, I was going to surprise him by sending him a thing
1260000	1263000	Or like, where, like, because I took his
1263000	1267000	Lyrics track into the software that I'm using to
1267000	1271000	And I was just like saying, oh, can I put, can I just put his stuff on top of
1271000	1273000	My stuff and like, add to it and stuff
1273000	1276000	I was actually a lot more challenging because
1276000	1279000	You know, tempos are always different and stuff
1279000	1281000	It's kind of a big deal, it's challenging
1281000	1284000	Trying to do that with the Mike Cravello theme song
1284000	1289000	And it's, it's like, I tried to drag the Mike Cravello theme song into
1289000	1292000	Into an editor, I was like, oh, I'll just figure out what tempo it is
1292000	1296000	And then I can lay shit on top of it, I could do like a cool Mike Cravello rap or something
1296000	1298000	But it's really hard
1298000	1300000	Because you can't really get rid of his guitar, right
1300000	1302000	You can't scrub his guitar
1302000	1303000	The baby ducks guy?
1303000	1305000	Yeah, that is a challenge, his guitar is in there
1305000	1308000	And he's like, he's kind of changing tempo and stuff like that
1308000	1311000	But I did a pretty good job
1311000	1313000	I can't play that now, whatever, but
1313000	1315000	Yeah, anyways, I'm playing, I'm doing music
1315000	1318000	What is it, what's wrong, what can we do for you
1318000	1323000	Like, how can the show be made better for the show-ruiner
1323000	1326000	If you're at home right now, Sean's mouth is wide open
1329000	1333000	Talking about the thing and then you're like, I'm not gonna play it now
1333000	1336000	You talk about it, get us all titillated
1337000	1339000	And then you're not gonna...
1339000	1341000	Oh shit, sounds great
1341000	1343000	Damn it
1343000	1346000	Oh shit, hold on buddy, hold on, I'm almost there
1346000	1347000	We're coming
1347000	1350000	His username is LongSockSilver
1352000	1355000	Apparently he was going for a reference that a couple people got
1355000	1357000	I don't know what it is
1357000	1359000	Instead of John's
1360000	1362000	Oh
1362000	1365000	God damn it, no, I'm not gonna do this to you buddy
1365000	1367000	I'm gonna start it on, like
1367000	1368000	I'm sorry, but
1368000	1370000	He deserves better
1389000	1396000	All my baby ducks are in a fucking row
1396000	1398000	All my baby ducks
1398000	1400000	All my baby ducks
1400000	1405000	All my baby ducks are in a fucking row
1405000	1407000	All my baby ducks
1407000	1410000	All my baby ducks
1410000	1413000	Yeah, there he is, LongCockSilver
1413000	1415000	LongSockSilver
1415000	1418000	LongCockSilver is a different guy entirely
1418000	1421000	But I recommend following him on Instagram as well
1421000	1424000	Looks like he's in, where is he?
1424000	1426000	Budapest
1426000	1428000	I see like a geotag here somewhere
1428000	1430000	Who cares, you can type him in
1430000	1432000	Who cares?
1432000	1433000	There he is in New York
1433000	1435000	He must be somewhat of a successful musician
1435000	1436000	He's like traveling around
1436000	1438000	Traveling
1438000	1440000	I wonder what his real name is
1440000	1441000	There he is in Brooklyn
1441000	1444000	Do you think a New York guy thinks I'm cool enough to do my song?
1444000	1445000	Yeah
1445000	1447000	Yeah, looks like he's kind of in the Brooklyn area here
1447000	1448000	All right
1448000	1449000	He's in all five boroughs
1449000	1451000	My music is like kind of fucking legit
1451000	1452000	Yeah, dude
1452000	1456000	Right now there's like 13 old black dudes in Memphis doing my baby ducks
1456000	1457000	Shut up
1457000	1458000	Yeah
1458000	1459000	You talked to them?
1459000	1460000	I was gonna tell you, yeah
1460000	1462000	Brandon, don't keep this from me
1462000	1464000	There's like a harmonica version
1464000	1465000	Ahh!
1465000	1467000	Yeah, and then CeeLo gets on one, it's really weird
1467000	1469000	Cee, note
1469000	1470000	CeeLo, CeeLo
1470000	1471000	CeeLo
1471000	1472000	Yeah, oh fucking CeeLo
1472000	1474000	CeeLo, God, I love him
1474000	1476000	Oh, yeah
1476000	1478000	Ohh
1478000	1480000	You and him go way back
1480000	1482000	You love the dungeon family
1482000	1485000	Yeah, love the dungeon family
1485000	1486000	Shit
1486000	1487000	You love Outcast
1487000	1489000	I love Outcast
1489000	1490000	Yeah
1490000	1491000	He loves it
1491000	1492000	Heya
1492000	1493000	Remember that fucking
1493000	1494000	Heya
1494000	1495000	See
1495000	1497000	We danced that entire summer to that song
1497000	1499000	Wherever it played
1499000	1500000	Jeff hates that song, man
1500000	1501000	Yeah, cause we played
1501000	1503000	He hates a million people
1503000	1511000	We ran in this pack, Dan and I, of about 14 people at its largest
1511000	1518000	And that summer we would dance to that song until like 8 in the morning, almost
1518000	1522000	We would go back to either our friend Jerry Miner's house or your house
1522000	1523000	And we'd fucking
1523000	1528000	You've never seen so many old people in their own private bar
1528000	1532000	It was like parrot heads, but for that goddamn song
1532000	1533000	Parrot head
1533000	1535000	Good times, man
1535000	1536000	Jimmy Buffett fans
1536000	1537000	Those are good times
1537000	1544000	I had a pitch at Netflix today and I was so grateful that they moved their place
1544000	1548000	Amazon, still hanging out in Santa Monica
1548000	1555000	Amazon, the people that invented everyone staying in their house forever
1555000	1561000	are the remaining production office that you have to drive eight hours to get to
1561000	1567000	They are Los Angeles's practice pitch
1567000	1569000	Jesus
1569000	1573000	Eight is an exaggeration, but six is absolutely not
1573000	1575000	Depending on what time of day you're leaving
1575000	1581000	I mean, and usually your pitch at Amazon is either at 9.30am, which means you have to leave at 4
1581000	1584000	Or it's at 4.30, which means you're getting home at 9pm
1584000	1586000	Right, on a Friday
1586000	1594000	These guys, I mean, they're just like, look, we're selling spatulas, we're making TV
1594000	1598000	We do whatever we want, like, they come to us, baby
1598000	1603000	And they're like, alright, so I had this idea, this robot, maybe he meets a fire hydrant
1603000	1609000	And they're just like, God love them, but they're just like, it's the practice pitch, man
1609000	1613000	There's nothing, there's people that sell shows to Amazon, I guess
1613000	1619000	I don't know what they do, maybe they get to the noon spot
1619000	1624000	So you leave at 10am, you get there at noon, and then they're like, they pop an Adderall
1624000	1633000	Like halfway through the drive, and then they just fucking peek in there and they're like, robot, fire hydrant, buy it!
1633000	1638000	Wow, that sounds like, it sucks, wow, that sounds really bad
1638000	1642000	That sounds like a really bad situation that you're going through
1642000	1648000	That's awful, that's so bad, that's terrible
1648000	1654000	Just move your offices to Amazon, or send one of your drones over to hear my pitch
1654000	1657000	Like, I'm never going to have a show on Amazon, come on
1657000	1658000	We don't know that yet
1658000	1661000	Don't look like an Amazon guy, come on, we all know the Amazon brand
1661000	1664000	They have a completely different onesie
1665000	1668000	Thanks, that was a very kind of you audience
1669000	1671000	Do you think you'll ever sit down tonight?
1671000	1677000	I don't know, man, I honestly, I'm not usually this kind of guy, but whatever upsets you
1678000	1679000	Oh shit
1679000	1685000	Like honestly, I could kind of tell, I was just sort of thinking in my head, I'm laying my cards on the table because I'm an honest person
1685000	1691000	Like, I was like, oh, Shrob fucking, he sat behind me because he thought that would be annoying
1692000	1698000	I'm just going to stand here all night so that he's fucking upstaged and it's going to drive him nuts
1698000	1702000	Because if he switches chairs, he's admitting he wants to be looked at
1702000	1709000	Which will be the biggest fucking weakness, that's his kryptonite, is admitting he wants people to like him
1710000	1711000	Wow
1712000	1716000	Yeah, Shrob, yeah, that is a weakness
1716000	1719000	Yeah, well, just say it, I want people to like me
1719000	1721000	I'd like people to like me
1721000	1722000	Do you want me to like you?
1722000	1723000	Sure, yeah
1723000	1724000	Quit fucking around
1725000	1727000	What are you fucking around all the time for?
1727000	1732000	What am I doing here? I'm sitting here, you're playing on your phone the whole drive over
1732000	1737000	You're complaining, oh, I'm sorry, the boobers, two miles away
1737000	1739000	I'm waiting outside, catching a death
1740000	1744000	So basically what we have is you are the Amazon offices
1745000	1748000	And you are Dan Harmon at three o'clock on a Friday
1748000	1749000	Yeah
1749000	1752000	All right, I'll move from Santa Monica to Burbank for you
1752000	1758000	I just want to point out that I think that Shrob sat here because that was the special chair
1758000	1760000	Is that the wolf urine?
1760000	1764000	Oh, yeah, this baby's got some amount of ounces
1764000	1770000	If I had foresight, I would have put the wolf urine in the brew mate and see if it stayed at wolf urine temperature
1770000	1773000	It warms it up to like piping hot for like a drug test
1773000	1775000	Do you think it needs to be hot to work?
1775000	1779000	Do you think, Brandon, do you think they just, to make all that, they say
1779000	1781000	It's so dark, look how dark it is
1781000	1783000	They have like a bunch of wolves go cross country
1783000	1784000	It's like coke
1785000	1788000	I think this wolf works in sales
1788000	1790000	They refuse to blow a coffee
1790000	1792000	We're having our own pie
1792000	1793000	Yeah, what's going on over here?
1793000	1794000	Sorry guys
1794000	1797000	Talking about wolf pee, like what, that's not interesting enough?
1797000	1800000	That's clearly the best substance on stage
1800000	1801000	We were talking about it, but
1801000	1803000	We were talking about how they get it
1803000	1805000	Oh, yeah, I was wondering that too
1805000	1807000	They must jerk them off
1809000	1811000	In exchange for pee later
1812000	1814000	They're like, oh, and the wolf's like
1814000	1816000	The wolf's like, you want to do what?
1816000	1819000	They put a cup in the room with the wolf
1819000	1821000	They come back, piss all over the floor
1821000	1824000	They slowly, over 20 years, they figured it out
1825000	1827000	The wolf is training them
1827000	1831000	They leave like a cat fancy magazine
1831000	1833000	I don't know what wolves jerk off to
1835000	1837000	The wolf gradually starts filling the cup
1837000	1840000	In response to increasingly sexual behavior
1842000	1843000	Then you're home free
1843000	1844000	I don't know, Michael
1844000	1847000	How come Michael always gets more wolf pee in the cup
1848000	1850000	Oh, he's wearing those short shorts
1854000	1855000	I know, I know
1856000	1857000	You guys are worried, you're like
1857000	1858000	Is the wolf gay?
1858000	1859000	Because then I can't laugh at it
1860000	1861000	No, it's a straight wolf
1862000	1864000	I know that it seems like
1864000	1865000	You should all know
1865000	1867000	But why do you have wolf pee?
1867000	1869000	I have wolf pee because I have a coyote problem
1869000	1872000	It seems like a weird joke is going to happen here
1873000	1875000	Is this going to attract wolves?
1876000	1878000	I know they sell bear pee
1878000	1879000	It was weird
1879000	1882000	Every kind of animal out there has pee for sale
1883000	1885000	Obviously humans are selling the pee
1885000	1887000	I don't mean that wolves are getting
1888000	1889000	This is exploitative
1889000	1891000	How do we know it's wolf pee?
1892000	1893000	Of course we don't know
1894000	1895000	But here's what I want to know
1896000	1897000	What is human pee?
1897000	1898000	Chopped liver?
1898000	1901000	In a world where coyote is going to go
1901000	1902000	You smell that?
1902000	1903000	A wolf took a pee here
1903000	1905000	Run for the hills
1905000	1906000	You're in my backyard
1906000	1908000	I invented bulldozers
1908000	1909000	What the fuck?
1911000	1912000	Fear my wrath
1912000	1915000	I'm destroying the planet with my pee
1915000	1917000	Like fucking run, baby
1918000	1920000	It smells like an alphabet
1920000	1921000	It might work
1923000	1924000	Have I tried it?
1924000	1925000	Well, yes I have
1925000	1926000	Because I'm an alcoholic
1926000	1928000	There's a lot of my pee in my backyard
1928000	1929000	Can we smell that shit?
1929000	1930000	If anything, it's attracting them
1930000	1931000	I don't want to smell it
1931000	1932000	They probably think I'm a coyote
1932000	1933000	Can we open it and smell it?
1933000	1934000	I don't want
1935000	1936000	But I don't want to
1936000	1938000	And certainly let's not lose any of it
1939000	1941000	Y'all about to watch a nigga go crazy
1943000	1944000	Two years you got left to say that word
1945000	1947000	I can say it as much as I want
1954000	1955000	That's interesting
1955000	1957000	That was a genuine reaction, huh?
1957000	1958000	Yeah, yeah, it really was
1958000	1961000	It was a very strong, I would say an arch reaction
1961000	1962000	It was a strong reaction
1962000	1964000	But did you notice it wasn't like immediate nausea
1964000	1965000	Like I wasn't like
1965000	1968000	It was like, it was just incredibly strong
1968000	1969000	Gerbils
1969000	1970000	Yeah, okay
1970000	1972000	It smells a little bit like a hamster cage
1972000	1973000	Gerbils
1973000	1974000	It smells like Gerbils
1974000	1976000	Oh, is it? You can smell it over there
1976000	1977000	Ah, ha, ha
1977000	1978000	Well, don't play that up
1978000	1979000	So it's like
1979000	1980000	You know, where people will start going
1980000	1982000	Oh, good, we get to complain about something
1982000	1984000	You know, there's so many millennials
1984000	1986000	It smells like roofing tar
1986000	1988000	You'll be caught as a stampede
1988000	1989000	I like it
1989000	1991000	Does it say it repels millennials?
1992000	1993000	We don't need to do that
1993000	1994000	Like in all these empty seats
1994000	1995000	We need, what attracts them?
1995000	1997000	We need like Pokemon pee
1997000	1999000	Oh, incense
1999000	2000000	Jobs
2000000	2001000	We need to move the show to Sunday night
2001000	2002000	Jobs
2002000	2003000	Jobs
2003000	2004000	Yeah
2004000	2005000	The smelt job pee
2007000	2008000	Genius bar
2008000	2010000	Availability pee
2011000	2012000	Oh, it smells like fish food
2012000	2013000	We took a survey
2013000	2014000	Some of you may have taken it
2014000	2016000	And the data seems to suggest
2016000	2017000	Agree or disagree
2017000	2018000	Maybe with your applause
2018000	2019000	If you feel moved to
2019000	2020000	Do you
2020000	2021000	Ah, ha, ha
2021000	2022000	But although this is going to be skewed
2022000	2023000	Exactly
2023000	2024000	Because you're here
2024000	2025000	Yeah
2025000	2026000	But like
2027000	2029000	Would you prefer if we moved to Sunday night
2029000	2031000	Like the tapings
2032000	2033000	This
2033000	2034000	Right
2034000	2035000	Oh, this is silence
2035000	2036000	Because these are the people here
2036000	2037000	Okay, this matters
2037000	2039000	There's just two nuns and a priest clapping right now
2039000	2040000	Okay
2040000	2042000	So we found the people that love it
2042000	2043000	That it's on Monday night
2043000	2044000	The Monday crew
2044000	2045000	Okay
2045000	2047000	Well, you guys seem nice
2047000	2048000	I don't care
2048000	2050000	I don't need to sell out a show
2050000	2052000	About me talking about Wolf Bee
2053000	2056000	But we were looking at the data that we took
2056000	2057000	We took a survey
2057000	2059000	Maybe it was among just fans in general or something
2059000	2063000	Because there seemed to be kind of a suggestion
2063000	2067000	From the data that people would be thrilled
2067000	2068000	If we moved to Sunday nights
2068000	2071000	But I don't know who you guys polled
2072000	2075000	Was it listeners or was it attendees?
2075000	2077000	I don't know
2077000	2079000	The methodology is in question
2079000	2082000	The Wolf Bee label is very DIY
2082000	2083000	Very Etsy
2084000	2085000	It says
2085000	2087000	There's impact font going up
2087000	2090000	Yeah, it's almost like a comic sans serif
2090000	2092000	Under the logo
2092000	2096000	It says Wolf Bee in impact font
2096000	2099000	100% wolf urine in impact font beneath that
2099000	2102000	Territorial marking scent in like aerial bold
2102000	2103000	In red
2103000	2105000	And then there's a photo of a wolf
2105000	2107000	But then there's a pretty impressive logo of a silhouette
2107000	2109000	Of a wolf in mid howl
2109000	2112000	And it says like in really proud confident letters
2112000	2115000	At a fucking striking rackish angle
2115000	2116000	Original
2118000	2120000	Since 1986
2122000	2124000	At Miami Vice theme
2124000	2127000	This pee's got cocaine in it, man
2127000	2130000	And then it says under that in like a very comic sans serif font
2130000	2133000	Creates the illusion that a wolf is nearby
2135000	2137000	Creates the illusion
2137000	2138000	Oh yeah
2138000	2139000	PredatorP.com
2139000	2141000	A tradition of quality
2142000	2144000	A tradition of quality urine
2144000	2147000	Bad, bad, bad, bad title
2147000	2149000	That's not a good title
2149000	2150000	PredatorP
2152000	2159000	Honey, you got your package from PredatorP
2160000	2163000	Oh, the label was very discreet
2163000	2165000	I was happy to see that
2165000	2167000	With a name like PredatorP
2167000	2169000	You better be discreet
2169000	2171000	Or you're gonna get some eyeballs
2171000	2173000	I'm gonna be really impressed if there's an ice cube in here
2174000	2175000	Oh yeah
2175000	2176000	That's impressive
2176000	2177000	I thought you meant the pee
2177000	2178000	Good job, brew house
2178000	2179000	Brew mate
2179000	2182000	How much pee do you need to convince a coyote
2182000	2183000	More than this
2183000	2185000	That there's a wolf in your backyard
2185000	2186000	I don't know
2186000	2189000	We opened the bottle and 50 people almost like left
2189000	2190000	And they're not even coyotes
2190000	2192000	A tradition of quality urine
2192000	2193000	15
2193000	2194000	Since 1986
2194000	2195000	I just wanted to read that
2195000	2196000	Okay
2196000	2197000	25
2197000	2198000	Directions for PredatorP liquid
2198000	2200000	To create a pee-rimiter
2201000	2202000	No
2202000	2203000	No
2203000	2204000	No
2204000	2205000	Really?
2205000	2207000	You motherfuckers
2207000	2208000	Yeah
2210000	2212000	I'm proud of them
2212000	2214000	You're proud of them?
2214000	2216000	Yeah, they're like the Bartles and James of pee
2216000	2217000	I don't know
2217000	2218000	They're just like
2218000	2219000	Look, we saw wolf pee
2219000	2220000	We're not gonna be refuseniks
2220000	2226000	We're not gonna call ourselves industrial scent harvests
2226000	2228000	Is that what Bartles and James does?
2228000	2229000	We're the biggest pee people in the business
2229000	2230000	You need pee?
2230000	2231000	We got pee
2231000	2232000	Here's a set up a pee-rimiter
2232000	2233000	Have fun with pee
2233000	2235000	It's like make pee part of your world
2235000	2237000	Like pee
2237000	2239000	Pee used to be the state of the art
2239000	2241000	You know, before lasers and fucking things
2241000	2242000	And guess what?
2242000	2243000	Coyotes don't care about your lasers
2243000	2245000	They probably would if you shot them with one
2245000	2246000	Speaking of which
2246000	2247000	Okay, so I bought this
2247000	2249000	And I also bought a slingshot
2250000	2253000	But I'm not gonna aim for the coyotes
2254000	2255000	I just got
2255000	2258000	But I got like a laser-guided slingshot
2259000	2260000	It's crazy
2260000	2262000	The illustration of the Amazon thing I sent to Kumail
2262000	2263000	He probably was offended
2263000	2264000	But
2264000	2266000	Because the guy kind of looked like Kumail
2266000	2267000	Like
2267000	2268000	Hilarious
2268000	2269000	Hilarious
2269000	2270000	Because he had his head down
2270000	2271000	Like the other photos
2271000	2272000	It's like
2272000	2274000	He's just like some doofy Italian guy
2274000	2275000	But he had his head at the right angle
2275000	2276000	He just like really looked
2276000	2277000	I was like Kumail
2277000	2278000	This is
2278000	2279000	I think this endorsement
2279000	2281000	Do you text him a lot?
2281000	2282000	Just when I
2282000	2283000	Just when I want to
2283000	2284000	What
2284000	2286000	What are you gonna hit with that slingshot?
2286000	2287000	I'm just gonna
2287000	2288000	I just got
2288000	2289000	I'm just gonna
2289000	2290000	Because here's the thing
2290000	2291000	Okay, the coyotes
2291000	2292000	This is how you know it's fucked up
2292000	2293000	Because you're
2293000	2294000	What
2294000	2295000	You're already
2295000	2296000	Trying to back away
2296000	2297000	No, no, no
2297000	2298000	I'm just gonna
2298000	2299000	I got this
2299000	2300000	It's an alternative to throwing rocks
2300000	2301000	I'm 46
2301000	2302000	Like here's what happened to me
2302000	2303000	Two nights ago
2303000	2304000	Okay
2304000	2305000	This is why I ordered the slingshot
2305000	2306000	These things
2306000	2307000	You know
2307000	2308000	I'm just protecting my babies
2308000	2309000	I'm not gonna do anything violent
2309000	2310000	To another animal
2310000	2311000	But like I can't
2311000	2312000	I
2312000	2313000	Asimov's laws
2313000	2314000	Like I can't by inaction
2314000	2317000	Allow violence to happen to my animals
2317000	2318000	So like
2318000	2319000	The coyotes started coming around
2319000	2321000	Probably refugees from the fire
2321000	2322000	Nobody's fault
2322000	2323000	I got video of one of them
2323000	2324000	Because they came out in the day
2324000	2325000	Beautiful creature
2325000	2327000	I expected them to look more like crazy
2327000	2328000	Like mangy
2328000	2329000	Like
2329000	2330000	Godly
2330000	2331000	Resident evil zombie dogs
2331000	2332000	The way they sound
2332000	2334000	But they look kind of like
2334000	2335000	Yeah, they're just
2335000	2336000	They have like deer
2336000	2337000	Pelt kind of things
2337000	2338000	They're like rabbit
2338000	2339000	Like they're kind of like
2339000	2340000	Beautiful camouflage
2340000	2342000	Like with these big pointy ears
2342000	2343000	Like a big fox
2343000	2344000	Yeah
2344000	2345000	And they're all
2345000	2346000	They're all genetically compatible
2346000	2347000	And dogs and stuff
2347000	2348000	And the whole genus
2348000	2349000	Is like
2349000	2350000	Just a big free-for-all
2350000	2351000	I guess that
2351000	2352000	I guess probably all genuses are
2352000	2353000	I mean we're in the homo genus
2353000	2354000	It's just that we fucking
2354000	2355000	Genocided all the other
2355000	2357560	We had coyotes and wolves
2357560	2359440	To our sapiens at one point
2359440	2362360	And we just fucking scrubbed them out
2362360	2363360	We were like
2363360	2364360	You guys wanna go to a rave?
2364360	2365360	And the Neanderthals were like
2365360	2366360	What's that?
2366360	2367360	And we're like
2367360	2368360	Fuck you idiot
2368360	2370700	Fucking no tweeting
2370700	2373280	Fucking caveman ass
2373280	2374640	So glad we stopped doing that
2374640	2375640	To other cultures
2376640	2377640	Oh yeah
2377640	2378640	What are you doing, Neanderthal?
2378640	2380640	Oh, I'm making a dreamcatcher
2380640	2383440	To bury with my lifelong mate
2383440	2384440	Because I love her
2384440	2385440	And believe in an afterlife
2385440	2386440	Fuck you
2386440	2387440	I can't hear you
2387440	2388440	Over the sound of me killing you
2388440	2390440	That's what happened
2390440	2392680	We were the killing ones
2392680	2395120	Yeah, happy?
2395120	2396120	You woke now
2396120	2397120	You're Hitler babies
2397120	2398120	By proxy
2398120	2401760	Going back 5,000 millennia
2401760	2403880	Don't look it up
2403880	2405120	To create a P. Rimeter
2405120	2407160	Saturate scent tags
2407160	2409000	Oh great, so hidden costs
2409000	2410560	I didn't order any scent tags
2410560	2411560	Oh boy
2411560	2412560	Or fill a
2412560	2416120	Or fill 33 day dispensers
2416120	2418120	These fucking P. Barons
2418120	2419120	P. Barons
2419120	2420120	What?
2420120	2421120	Wait a minute
2421120	2422120	And hang every 10 to 12 feet
2422120	2424680	I think I know what the P. Dispenser is
2424680	2427680	A hard dick
2427680	2429720	I mean come on
2429720	2430720	It's a wolf
2430720	2431720	Give me a break
2431720	2432720	You gotta buy a wolf
2433480	2434480	Get a dispenser
2434480	2435480	Order it
2435480	2436480	Yeah, exactly
2436480	2438480	It's a bucket with a hole in it
2438480	2439480	So then you go
2439480	2440480	Ooh, do you need a refill?
2440480	2441480	It's a dick
2441480	2442480	What dick?
2442480	2443480	They can't sell a dick
2443480	2444480	They can't sell a dick
2444480	2445480	A dick
2445480	2446480	I was right
2446480	2447480	It was a dick
2447480	2448480	What about just
2448480	2449480	It's a bucket with a hole in it
2449480	2450480	What does your dick look like?
2450480	2452480	All right, well this isn't gonna work
2452480	2453480	This isn't gonna work
2453480	2454480	No, no, no
2454480	2458040	Why not just add like one of those fucking spray bottle tops to it
2458040	2459040	There is that
2459040	2460040	Okay, Jesus
2460040	2462160	Predator P. Yardcover is designed to make it
2462600	2467320	Easy to spread Predator P. For applications on lawns, flower beds, gardens, and other areas
2467320	2470840	Where creating a P. Rimeter would be difficult or impractical
2470840	2478400	For pet training, saturate a 10 square foot diameter area to help you direct pets to the
2478400	2482800	areas of your yard that you designate as pet restrooms
2482800	2484760	So make those smell like wolf pee
2484760	2486520	Make the pet restrooms smell like wolf pee?
2486520	2487520	That's what it said, right?
2487520	2488520	It doesn't say
2488520	2489520	It says
2489520	2490520	Make your dogs love wolf pee
2490520	2492520	No, it says
2492520	2493520	What it says is
2493520	2496680	Saturated 10 square foot diameter area
2496680	2499400	Oh, so that's the P. Rimeter
2499400	2500400	Well, I don't know
2500400	2501400	I don't know
2501400	2502880	So a square diameter is what they want
2502880	2503880	Oh, yeah
2503880	2507760	To help you direct pets to the areas of your yard
2507760	2510760	So I think the areas of your yard are wolf pee free
2510760	2511760	Right, yeah
2511760	2512760	I think the dogs are like
2512760	2513760	Shit, there's a wolf
2513760	2514760	Shit, there's a wolf
2514760	2515760	Wolf's everywhere
2515760	2516760	Yeah
2516760	2517760	Right
2517760	2518760	I can pee here
2518760	2519760	I'm not gonna do that to my dogs
2520480	2521480	My dogs know they can pee wherever they want
2521480	2526480	I think we just need to get that wall area kind of
2526480	2527480	Peed up
2527480	2528480	That is real dark pee
2528480	2531080	Um, yeah, got a slingshot
2531080	2532160	Oh, because here's why
2532160	2534120	So don't, yeah, I'm not a maniac
2534120	2536760	I, uh, these things come around
2536760	2539920	And the dogs freak out
2539920	2541480	They like want to go out there and talk to them
2541480	2542480	and all this stuff
2542480	2543480	Okay
2543480	2545080	So, used to be like
2545080	2548200	Okay, going back like six weeks, three months maybe
2548640	2551640	Uh, like, oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
2551640	2553800	And they make this fucking racket
2553800	2555080	It's been getting more intense
2555080	2557480	Like, very aggressive coyote behavior happening
2557480	2560440	Uh, and, uh, I go downstairs
2560440	2561600	Turn the kitchen light on
2561600	2563200	They, they go quiet
2563200	2565080	So then, you know, a little after that
2565080	2567080	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
2567080	2571480	Like, like, two, two days, a week later
2571480	2572480	Turn the kitchen light on
2572480	2573880	Nope, that's not gonna work anymore
2573880	2574880	Go out the back door
2574880	2576040	Okay, now they shut up
2576040	2577880	And so on and so forth from there
2577880	2581080	Like, leading to me with a fucking, like, stick
2581080	2583000	Going, like, shut up!
2583000	2585480	And, uh, and then the most humiliating
2585480	2587560	This is why I bought a weapon now from Amazon
2587560	2590440	Is because I'm not, I'm, uh, I'm, like, dude
2590440	2592920	Like, this is really humiliating
2592920	2595560	Like, me standing on a ladder
2595560	2599320	Like, like, sh-sh-shaking a stick at them
2599320	2600760	And going, shut up!
2600760	2603400	And then going, like, meh, yah, yah!
2603400	2606600	I, like, I felt, like, I already have a small penis
2606600	2610040	It shrank, like, into my abdomen
2610040	2612840	Like, my penis is in one of my nipples now
2612840	2616440	Like, like, I got cucked out by some fucking monster dogs
2616440	2619160	And you think that this slingshot, you will, uh
2619160	2619800	Well, because I win it
2619800	2622120	So, I was like, okay, I'm gonna throw rocks
2622120	2623480	So, here's an incredible thing
2623480	2624520	There's no rocks!
2624520	2626920	Like, I was, did they, did they phase those out?
2626920	2628360	Like, I was, like, when I was 10 years old
2628360	2629800	It seemed like there were rocks everywhere
2629800	2631960	Big rocks are inimicalble
2631960	2633240	Is that a word? What does that mean?
2633240	2633720	Sure
2634280	2635160	For society
2635880	2637320	It was, I looked all over
2637320	2639400	I couldn't believe how hard it was to find a rock
2639400	2642040	I felt, is that progress, or is that, uh, bad?
2642040	2643320	I think they're phasing them out
2643320	2645720	Because you could do, you could hit someone with them and stuff
2645720	2648360	They don't want people just, like, to be able to break into someone's car
2648360	2649960	With just a piece of the environment
2650840	2652600	I believe Schwab is proposing to you
2652600	2653800	You should use ice
2653800	2654680	That's what I did
2654680	2655800	I went to my ice maker
2655800	2656680	I got a bucket of ice
2656680	2657720	I threw ice at them
2657720	2660280	After, after about five minutes of throwing ice
2660280	2661000	They stopped
2661000	2662760	I'm pretty sure because they were like
2662760	2663720	Thank you, that's better
2663720	2664760	I was dehydrated
2665720	2667400	So you're, you're hitting them with ice?
2667400	2668440	I'm not hitting them
2668440	2671880	You think I'm, like, man enough to hit a coyote in the dark with ice?
2671880	2674360	I don't know where you are or where they are in this situation
2674360	2675240	Exactly, well, what I'm doing
2675240	2676520	I'm in my backyard
2676520	2678200	And, um, oh, it's like D&D
2678200	2679400	I'm in my backyard
2679400	2680840	I'm facing the back wall
2680840	2682760	The north wall in my backyard
2682760	2684920	I'm standing on a bar stool
2684920	2687800	And, uh, so I'm eye level with the, with the ground
2687800	2688120	Right
2688120	2688920	Uh, thing
2688920	2691240	And I can hear them in the pitch black
2691240	2692840	But in that yard, right?
2692840	2693400	Oh, yeah
2693400	2694600	Okay, yeah, that's, yeah
2695640	2699720	And, and so I just, I'm just whipping handfuls of ice cubes in that direction
2699720	2703320	I figure, you know, and I just, and they just kept, kept yipping
2703320	2704760	And then after a while they stopped
2704760	2706040	I truly believe they were like
2706040	2706840	This is delicious
2707560	2710200	So they're turning you basically into a person who is
2710840	2715400	Reaching out to a company that makes devices that are rudimentary to attack them
2715400	2715960	Yeah, it's true
2715960	2716680	Like I'm meeting them on my level
2716680	2717880	Like ACME
2717880	2718200	Yeah
2720600	2723640	I am not the roadrunner in this situation, for sure, yeah
2723640	2724360	That's funny, yeah
2724760	2727080	You have really gone to their level at this point
2728760	2731960	Truly acting as a fucking fictional coyote
2731960	2735160	That is a really, really profound insight
2735880	2738120	I'm like ordering from fucking Amazon
2738120	2739080	It's the ACME
2739080	2739880	That's incredible
2739880	2745160	I, I know it's like these crazy, like three-strapped, like, crazy, like laser-guided things
2745160	2745800	It's insane
2746520	2747320	It's true
2747320	2749800	It's, it's a hundred percent, like, parallel
2749800	2752440	I cannot wait to see the rocket that you build
2753400	2754120	With skates
2754120	2755240	I'm getting, like, floodlights
2755240	2757080	I'm gonna put traps back there and be like
2757080	2759080	They're not working and jumping up and down on them
2761720	2764280	I did think, at a certain point I was thinking as I was throwing the ice
2764280	2767000	I was like, oh, now they're, maybe they're eating the ice and now they like me
2767000	2770760	And then I thought, well, if they could shut the fuck up and never eat my dogs
2770760	2775640	I will say, you know, maybe they're eating, like, raccoons, skunks
2777000	2777560	Fruit
2777560	2780120	People who, who keep outdoor
2780920	2781320	Cats
2782200	2784200	Like, I don't, I don't, I love the cats
2784200	2786840	Therefore, I want their owners to suffer for making them outdoor cats
2788120	2791000	So that in the long term people love their cats enough to keep them indoors
2791000	2793480	But, so, you know, it's, it's complicated
2793480	2797160	I'm like that guy in the watchman who was like, hmm, let's, let's start a nuclear war
2797160	2797960	Yeah
2797960	2798760	We'll have world peace
2798760	2799640	Osmandius
2799640	2801240	I'm like, I hope all their cats get eaten
2801240	2803240	So they learn to be nice to cats
2804200	2806760	What, what, what's happening? What are you talking about?
2806760	2808760	I'm just listening to you talk, man
2809320	2810280	Just listening
2810280	2811400	I don't like this at all
2812520	2813560	This makes me uncomfortable
2813560	2814520	Still icing this thing
2815160	2816440	That's crazy, huh?
2816440	2817240	That's just a testament
2817240	2818600	I haven't been drinking out of it a long time
2818600	2819400	It, yeah
2819400	2820760	It's, it's a
2820760	2821800	Quality product
2821800	2822600	It's a doozy
2822600	2824280	Because it's a hard one to win
2824280	2829480	But I don't think, I don't think, I don't think the slingshot is your boy
2830280	2833080	If the coyotes come into the yard, maybe the slingshot
2833080	2836840	But I just, I think that their, the coyote's MO is usually to lure
2836840	2839240	They do the yipping thing to kind of lure dogs out
2839240	2841560	And then they kind of like nip them up or whatever
2841560	2841720	But
2841720	2842520	Yeah, I know
2842520	2844040	But I'm not, I'm not judging, sorry
2844040	2851640	I, no, I do think, well, the worst case scenario is the one where it's like, it's, is zero-sum game, an appropriate phrase here
2851640	2855560	It's like, the day that one of those fuckers does tumble into the yard
2855560	2856040	Right
2856040	2860920	It's like, it's gonna be an extreme situation
2860920	2863640	I don't think a slingshot is the tool for that either
2864200	2866040	Like, at that point, I don't know what to do
2866680	2867560	The slingshot's fine
2867560	2868520	Let's get a
2868520	2872440	But I'm looking at that as the reason why I want them to like scoot back a little bit
2872440	2872920	Yeah, no
2872920	2878040	Because I feel like they're, it's just like, maybe like a pup of theirs that's gonna be like hunger
2878840	2881960	Dazed or something's gonna like fall into the backyard
2882520	2884200	It could, it could be a mess, you know
2884200	2887880	The problem is that that neighbor's yard is just coyote HQ
2887880	2888120	Yeah
2889160	2889640	Why is that?
2889640	2892600	Is there any update on that, like, looking into that?
2893240	2894600	We, we have their phone number
2894600	2895960	We're gonna actually just go up
2895960	2898040	But we don't think they live there necessarily
2898040	2899320	Yeah, it's there
2899320	2902840	They had their pug or bulldog that would fall into my yard
2902840	2907320	And like, that thing's got, if that thing's alive, it's Rambo
2907320	2907800	Right
2908680	2912680	Because it just walks around back there where there's nothing but coyotes
2912680	2914200	It would be amazing to see it
2914200	2916840	Like, like to walk back there and find it, like, hiding
2916840	2920600	Like, like, just breathing through a bamboo shoot
2921000	2921500	Yeah
2922680	2928760	So you, didn't you, you listened to, I told Spencer, like, I'm really interested in your take
2928760	2931320	I'm the guy I call Asperger Detective
2931320	2931820	Right
2932760	2934920	And I call him that as a handle
2934920	2941240	I, I felt today inclined to iterate that, like, iterate
2941240	2941960	That means say
2942840	2953080	Um, I felt inclined to just say, you know, I, I call him Asperger Detective
2953080	2955880	Because I kind of, I wouldn't do it if I thought that that would offend him
2956680	2959960	Like, if somebody, if somebody was doing a podcast and it sounded like they had a hair lip
2959960	2961880	And they never mentioned their hair lip
2961880	2963960	I wouldn't be like, hair lip, hair lip guy
2963960	2967160	I mean, maybe with Cody or somebody, like, you want to listen to hair lip guy?
2967160	2971560	But, like, you know, I think that the guys could, like, based on his comments and stuff
2971560	2976040	I feel like, whether he has Asperger's or not, he'd be like, that's kind of cool
2976040	2978040	Like, he'd be like punk rock about it
2978040	2981480	But, so, you know, it's just, so I just wanted to say that
2981480	2984280	I don't, you know, it's hard these days
2984280	2986600	I don't want to, I don't want to be hurtful to any real people
2987400	2990200	I just want to, I just want people to leave me alone, give me money
2991080	2992760	I don't even, I don't need you to come here
2992760	2994120	I don't need to keep doing this show
2994120	2996520	I just, it's kind of, I'm all momentum at this point
2996520	2998600	Just kind of drifting, you know
2999320	3000120	Very happy
3000120	3002040	Just want to steal, take my money
3002040	3003080	I didn't mean to say steal
3004520	3005320	It's totally earned it
3005320	3006360	I've earned every penny
3007480	3008520	My job's very hard
3008520	3009960	I take it, buy a big house
3009960	3011720	Disappear into the West Wing
3011720	3018360	And you'll hear, like, just the sound of a man eating a chocolate sundae
3020440	3022680	That'll be my equivalent of a single gunshot
3022680	3026280	Just, like, a week of chocolate sundae eating
3026520	3028440	It's the same thing Stan Lee said
3029320	3029960	We did
3029960	3032760	And then he died over a Spider-Man comic
3033400	3033880	What?
3034520	3035640	Wait, shut up
3035640	3037400	He died on top of one?
3037400	3037560	Yeah
3038680	3041000	What did he say before that? What did he say?
3041000	3043080	I just want to do this for, like, 10 more years
3043800	3045640	Well, he's, like, 97
3045640	3048760	You say when he was 87, he was like, I just want to do this for 10 more years
3048760	3051000	And so you're like, oh, man, that's how you die
3052120	3052360	No
3053080	3053720	Yeah
3053720	3057320	It's like the curse of the Golden Girls, like, Onion Headline
3058920	3061240	What's the curse of the Golden Girls?
3061240	3062600	You could probably put it together, right?
3063240	3065320	No, I'm asking a question
3065320	3069320	Why would I ask the question if I didn't know what?
3069320	3070440	I could put it together
3072120	3073240	There was an Onion Headline
3073240	3075800	It was, like, I can't remember the content
3075800	3078840	It was, like, you know, someone dies
3080200	3082840	continuing a curse of the cast of Golden Girls
3082840	3087640	Because the joke is they were at an age where it would be fully appropriate
3087640	3090040	statistically for them to be dying at the rate that they were
3090040	3091000	Ha ha
3091000	3091400	All right
3091400	3092200	That's pretty funny
3093080	3093800	I like that
3094760	3095480	Oh, okay
3096440	3099640	So you were asking Spencer what he thought
3099640	3102680	Yeah, what's your take? You said you listened to 13 episodes of this guy
3102680	3103960	Yeah, I've been listening to him
3103960	3107960	I don't know if he's, he might be, he, oh
3107960	3112280	So, okay, the show is the guy, like, writes an essay, essentially
3112280	3115480	And then he just reads the essay on the podcast
3115480	3120600	Because it's, like, it's not, like, there's not room for his, just, personal musings
3120600	3122680	It's all just straight, like, a script that he's wrote
3122680	3125080	But to the extent that it's, like, an essay
3125080	3130360	he, like, always has some sort of thesis statement or theme that he's, like, weaving through it
3130360	3135160	Which is, I don't know, sometimes it sounds like the most stupid pretentious shit
3135160	3137640	Like, or sometimes he focuses on stuff
3137640	3140760	Like, there is the one where he was focusing on, like, I don't know
3140760	3143880	There's the guy whose wife fell down the stairs or he killed her or whatever
3143880	3147560	And then, like, the 911 calls, like, she fell down the stairs
3147560	3150360	And the lady's, like, how many stairs? And he was, like, what?
3150360	3153960	And then, and then he was, like, why did he say what?
3153960	3155320	It's obvious he was hiding the truth
3155320	3156920	And it's, like, well, that's a stupid question
3156920	3159880	It doesn't matter how many fucking stairs someone fell down
3159880	3162040	I would be, like, what the fuck are you talking about?
3162760	3164280	So, I don't know, a lot of-
3164280	3165400	Wait, let me count
3165400	3168120	Yeah, it's, like, that's not, that's not helpful
3168120	3171400	It is, though, because you want to know, should you send some cops or an ambulance?
3171400	3172280	Or a ladder
3172280	3174680	I mean, both! Why don't you sort it out afterwards?
3174680	3177080	I, my wife's dead or dying
3177080	3178840	Kind of, like, like, he'll do, he'll do, kind of
3178840	3181480	I like when he does unsolved stuff and then he proposes a theory
3181480	3181960	Because-
3181960	3183480	Right, that stuff's really impressive
3183480	3187880	At his best, I like him because he reminds me of Agent Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks
3187880	3192280	Because Dale Cooper rolls into your town and you're, like, we can't find out who killed Laura Palmer, right?
3192280	3196440	So, and so, you call the FBI when it's, like, resources are exhausted
3196440	3203800	And in David Lynch's universe, the FBI is equivalent to, like, a weird, like, shamanic tier of civilization
3203800	3211000	But, like, Dale Cooper's, like, he's learned how to, like, it's, like, if only for the sake of being lateral
3211000	3212280	Because nothing else is working
3212280	3216280	It's, like, oh, oh, you know, like, he'll throw rocks at a tin can
3216280	3216840	Yeah
3217320	3220920	And if it, it's sort of, like, it's almost, like, flipping a coin
3220920	3225800	Or, like, Asperger Detective will do something, like, he's, like, in 1985
3227800	3231480	John Swanson went into the woods and never came back
3231480	3234200	People have been talking about this for quite a while
3234200	3237640	But the one thing that they can't figure out is whether or not his friend did it
3239400	3241080	Or whether or not it was murder
3241080	3242440	But here's the thing
3242440	3246360	I'd like to look at the case through the lens of parabolic Turing's law
3247080	3247960	And you're, like, what?
3247960	3250040	And it's, like, or he'll do it
3250040	3251000	It's not always, like, nerdy
3251000	3255160	He'll be, like, he'll be, like, the interesting thing is that him going off the path
3255160	3256840	Reminds me of The Breakfast Club
3256840	3258520	There was a movie by John Hughes
3258520	3262840	John Hughes made movies in 1982 through 1997
3262840	3267560	And all of his movies tended to involve disparate groups of people forced to get along together
3267560	3268360	And learning things
3268360	3273240	Like, he goes in this, it goes in these, like, tears of, like, he'll, and then he'll, like,
3273240	3275560	These themes of, like, aviation or something
3275560	3278920	And then every once in a while, he'll just throw a fucking spark plug
3278920	3281640	And he, because his episodes are three and a half hours long
3281640	3283160	He never listens to them again or edits them
3283160	3285320	So, so every once in a while
3285320	3287080	Well, his earlier episodes are pretty short
3287080	3288920	And I listen at 2x speed
3290360	3295320	Oh, I mean, I don't know if I, we, this is him just, like, kind of throwing a shoe
3296520	3298440	Cody recorded this because we were, like, whoa
3300760	3304600	The lack of technology will even be symbolized in their deaths
3304600	3307240	By use of phone cord to create their bindings
3314360	3316200	So, if all of this crazies
3317640	3319960	This dude reached for leftover rice
3319960	3321720	Yeah, he came back to the microphone
3321720	3323320	Like, I don't know how much the mic picks up
3323320	3327000	But also there's just set up, like, a peel of half dry lips in there
3327000	3332920	It's, like, and I really, again, this is one of those situations where, like, you know,
3332920	3336520	I don't, I don't want, I'm not, I'm not punching down, punching sideways, punching up
3336520	3339320	I don't want to be punching, like, which is why I then add
3340440	3343560	I just hate this, like, feeling of, like, like, him getting, like,
3344360	3346440	you know, receiving in the wrong way
3346440	3348440	That we were talking and talking shit
3348440	3352840	And I just want him to know that, like, I mean, obvious, like, he's a part of our life
3352840	3356280	We love him, like, he's, like, we keep listening and listening and listening
3356280	3359560	I totally, like, I see his haters and reviews
3359560	3361640	And I can understand what they're saying
3361720	3364440	But I'm, like, I hate them, like, they're haters
3364440	3366040	And, like, I like the guy
3366040	3369640	He's, like, so brazenly fucking, like, lateral
3369640	3371960	I also, like, really worry about him sometimes
3371960	3376040	Like, he, he, I don't, did you hear one where he, like, started talking about, like,
3376040	3378520	he went straight into, like, fucking numerology or something
3378520	3380200	Where he was, like, I was, I can't wait
3380200	3381640	I, I had to, I paused it with Cody
3381640	3383560	I'm, like, wait, is he, is he rounding a bend?
3383560	3385960	Because he usually will just go, um,
3385960	3388840	So, Jompany Ramsey was found in the train room
3388840	3392120	There have been three, um, main functions of locomotion
3392120	3394040	Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution
3394040	3397160	So I want to look at this from a perspective of transportation
3397160	3401000	But, but he'll bring it back around to be, like, we should look at this murder scene
3401000	3405240	From the perspective of how much energy it takes to get from A to B
3405240	3409640	And consistently the human race has a tendency to try to conserve as much energy
3409640	3411240	This is a genetic imperative
3411240	3414120	If you expend more resources than you acquire by going where you're going
3414120	3415480	And then he'll work his way around
3415480	3418680	He's just, what he's really saying is, like, no one that's looked at this crime
3418680	3423160	Scene has, has necessarily found the fingerprint that says exactly what happened
3423160	3427160	So why not just, like, spin around, like, a pinata game
3427160	3430360	And kind of, like, stop and look at it from now this crazy perspective
3430360	3433240	And if you look at the Jompany Ramsey home crime scene
3433240	3435880	Maybe from this perspective of, like, transportation
3437080	3440920	Then he'll come up with this theory of, like, oh, uh, Gordon Ramsay
3440920	3441720	Not Gordon Ramsay
3441720	3442440	Who was it?
3442440	3443400	Yeah, Gordon Ramsay
3443400	3444360	It was, it was
3444360	3446200	I think Gordon Ramsay did it
3446200	3448120	He's the only member of the Ramsay clan
3448120	3449480	That wasn't present in the house
3449480	3451880	Yeah, she burnt, uh, uh
3451880	3454680	She burnt one of the cakes in an easy bake of his
3454680	3456360	Every time I've seen Gordon Ramsay
3456360	3458280	He's becoming extremely intolerant
3458280	3461080	When aspects of, uh, uh
3461080	3463800	When aspects of his environment are not up to snuff
3463800	3466200	He's a man who won't tolerate order
3466200	3467640	Or chaos, chaos
3468520	3472600	Gordon Ramsay, if he was in that house, would have killed Jompany Ramsey
3472600	3474520	It's a case that solves itself
3474520	3476680	But, no, but, but my point is, like, he will, he will come back
3476680	3479640	And he'll go, and I'll go, like, goddamn, I think he, I think he got it
3479640	3484040	I think that is, like, a fucking, like, really viable, different take on the
3484040	3485240	Jompany Ramsey thing
3485240	3490120	But then there was this one where it was, like, he was, like, this family got murdered in a cabin
3490120	3492760	And it was, like, I was, like, maybe I'm not hearing him right
3492760	3495960	But I think he's, like, he's, he's detached
3495960	3498280	And he's, like, floating off like a balloon
3498280	3502840	Like, because he was, like, the cabin, the cabin number was 486
3502840	3508680	In 1986, uh, uh, the, the, the Steven Spielberg, uh, came out with, uh, something
3508680	3510840	I, it was, like, it was, like, so he starts talking about the movies
3510840	3513160	I'm trying, if I riff, then you guys will be, like, oh, that's wrong
3513160	3514840	I'm gonna be riffing, like, I, I think
3514840	3520200	Well, what he really does is, like, there's a guy he's accusing of making up a fake murderer
3520200	3522920	And he's, like, and who is that murderer's name?
3522920	3524600	Romano Romero
3524600	3530920	It's, it's R.R., which indicates he was trying to complete the cycle and give the person what they wanted
3531160	3534040	And it's, like, well, you just said that
3534040	3540280	Right, and this, this one was, like, he went from, like, the date of the murders or the address to,
3540280	3544360	like, or he went from the date of the murders to, like, the date of a movie release
3544360	3548680	Or, like, like, like, back then how, like, taking airplanes somewhere was, like, a new thing
3548680	3554520	Because the murders have, okay, the murders happened in, like, a cabin in the, like, 80s
3554520	3559800	When domestic, like, resorts that people would take vacations to
3559800	3561480	So he referenced the movie Vacation
3561480	3565160	He references the movie Dirty Dancing, which did not take place in the 80s
3565160	3566760	But it was made in the 80s
3566760	3574680	But he references these movies that symbolize the fact that there was a trans, a trans, a trans, a trans, a trans
3574680	3576920	What the fuck am I, what's the, I lost a word
3576920	3577240	What?
3577240	3578120	A tendency
3578120	3580840	A transition in, you lost that word
3580840	3582520	Yeah, I'm old and drunk and dying
3583880	3585400	You're gonna lose your words too
3585400	3587480	And you know what, the first word you're gonna lose is me
3587480	3589160	So, fuck you in advance
3589160	3591480	You're gonna forget me, and you're gonna miss me, and you won't know why
3591480	3592760	Because you won't remember who I am
3592760	3593560	Whoa
3593560	3595000	It's called getting haunted
3596840	3598120	Should have finished my business
3598120	3599000	I don't know what I'm saying
3599000	3599880	I have no idea
3599880	3600840	One of the guys
3600840	3601880	That's why I like this guy
3601880	3609000	The main thing is, like, his angle is about examining, like, the human mind, human tendencies
3609000	3612680	And he's, like, so, I don't know, like, he did Serial and he did Adnan
3612680	3617880	And he, like, analyzed while, like, all the murder really closely replicates his
3618120	3619720	oppressed lifestyle or something
3619720	3623960	And so his angle is, like, this all lines up from a human behavioral perspective
3623960	3627720	And a lot of these cases fall apart because you get hung up on the evidence
3627720	3632840	And really, it's about matching whether or not, like, all the emotional mental states that people
3632840	3634200	lines up with the crime
3634200	3637720	Because usually, again, people know each other when they commit crimes of passion
3637720	3641240	And so that usually indicates some sort of pattern of behavior playing out
3641240	3643000	But he went from the zeitgeist
3643000	3644040	But crazy, but good
3644040	3647560	I mean, that's the thing is, like, that's what's fascinating to me is, like, the very fine line
3647560	3650760	Because, like, I remember when the internet first, like, kind of was blossoming
3650760	3656920	And one of my most, I was particularly fascinated with, like, with people who were,
3658040	3660120	forgive me, but clearly schizophrenic
3660120	3665480	Like, who, at the, you know, sort of, like, the people would just have, like, websites
3665480	3666680	You know, there was no Tumblr
3666680	3670920	There was no, like, you know, it was just sort of, like, some of the first people into the
3670920	3675960	worldwide web to, like, because it was, like, a place for, like, aberrant stuff
3675960	3681720	And, like, there was a lot of websites you would find that were just people going, like,
3681720	3683720	This is, this is my story
3683720	3689000	Like, it was 1997 when I realized that Harrison Ford was, like, trying to read my mind
3689000	3692840	And, like, their whole, like, story was, like, and they're very, like, hyper, what do you call it,
3692840	3693560	hyper-graphic
3693560	3694760	I don't know if that's the correct term
3694760	3699560	But, like, they just, like, at a time when the internet was all just, like, text
3699560	3703720	And it was, like, they were, like, people with tragic mental illnesses
3703720	3705560	Like, like, watching them
3705560	3707880	I'm not, you guys are, like, are you calling this guy mentally ill?
3707880	3712760	No, but I'm saying, like, the, the crazy, the, the, the interest, fascinating thing to me has always
3712760	3717880	been, like, what are these lines, you know, like, what drop of chemical, what spark that could jump
3717880	3721480	from one little part of your circuit board to another makes the big difference between
3721480	3726680	someone who's valued at NASA for figuring out, like, how, like, that a rocket should do this
3726680	3731000	And then some poor kid that, like, when they're 20 years old, they just realize their shoes are
3731000	3735080	hot dogs and they just get expunged from society and they're homeless under a bridge because we
3735080	3741240	don't respect, like, mental illnesses as regular illness and, like, um, uh, and, and, like, like,
3741240	3745560	so when I'm listening to Asperger Detective and he, like, he every once in a while, like, kind of,
3745560	3752200	he goes, he went from, like, a date in his cabin so he had, like, the zeitgeist of air travel
3752200	3757720	within, like, the American culture of, like, how resorts were closing down because people were now
3758600	3763880	airlines were affordable so people were going to Europe more so there were places in America
3763880	3770120	where cabins became, like, cheaper and, like, the, the clientele became more impoverished and so they
3770120	3774600	got more run down and so prices kept going down and basically, like, he was making the case that,
3774600	3781000	like, he's, like, there's these places that used to be fancy that became, like, like, uh, the hotel
3781000	3785160	and the shining but for regular customers who are just, like, these freaking thugs or whatever
3785160	3790200	I have no idea if he's, like, if that's based on any accurate data but he was, like, that was his
3790200	3794040	kind of zeitgeist or this, that's one of these places where this murder took place so he's,
3794040	3798440	like, he's already got, like, this airplane thing going on in his head and then it's, like, so then
3798440	3802600	it was, like, the murder's happening on this date and then he's, like, interestingly enough that was
3802600	3807400	the date of, like, I don't know, Back to the Future's release or something and it was, like,
3807400	3813480	Back to the Future is about Marty McFly, part of a younger generation who takes a car that's capable
3813560	3819640	of flying, who, that takes, like, a car couldn't fly in the first one, um, but, but, uh, he, and then he,
3819640	3825320	the crazy one about that one is that he come, he, he, instead of coming back down, he just floats and
3825320	3831000	then he goes, like, uh, and, and, and the, the, the sequel to this movie or that movie happened at this
3831000	3838200	time and, and the, the, what that got at the box office was $498 million so you have to ask,
3838200	3845240	was there a cabin with the address? $498. And if there is, would there be another person there
3845240	3851560	who's a suspect in the murder? And what do you know? And I was, like, what? No! That's not, that's
3851560	3858840	not what you usually do, Dale Cooper. You just, you just got a, a lead about who to arrest from
3858840	3863960	a fucking Jaws movie. Like, that's that, and I, maybe I heard it wrong, but I was, like, oh,
3863960	3869160	is he every once in a while just, like, popping, he popping off the Hot Wheels track a little bit.
3869160	3874600	There was another one. I think it was that same murder, but I can't remember, but, uh, he, he
3874600	3880600	accuses the guy of realizing he wanted to commit the murder after he saw a movie and he was like,
3880600	3885480	oh, and I was like, why did he do it? Because the movie was the ghosts of his past. It was played
3885480	3891160	out when they stored the, they stormed the Nazi castle. The Nazi castle castle was storing his
3891160	3895880	poor memories or something. And it was like, I don't even know, maybe the facts of the case was
3895880	3900200	that he watched this movie, but the guy was just asserting, like, this guy did it, and it was because
3900200	3904600	he watched this movie, and this movie is the perfect analog for his life, and that's why he
3904600	3912200	murdered. And it was like, this is all interactions, you know, in human, uh, perception. I think we all
3912200	3918280	are playing this sort of detective throughout the damn day, right? Because, because he is able to say,
3918280	3922600	I don't get the answer. I don't get, yeah, he knows the right answer. So the way he works
3922600	3927480	backwards is super interesting and that's to keep his ass personalized and on air. There's some
3927480	3932440	respect. It's something that we all sort of do. Like that person did not let me in that parking
3932440	3936360	space because they saw what kind of car I drove and they, they made a judgment about me because
3936360	3943320	it's dirty today. And there is a little bit of a Hulk, like, uh, uh, porn kind of like nerd rage
3943320	3947880	kind of thrill I get too. Cause he's like such, yeah, he's like, you can tell like he's, he's
3947880	3954840	driven by like a, like truly like a fetish for explanation. Like I feel like he, he actually
3954840	3961400	like more, even more than me, which is a lot like he just loves the feeling of explaining. It's like,
3961400	3965160	I love it. Like he becomes like when a dog puts its head up the window, it probably just doesn't
3965160	3969000	even know. He's just like, I, I'm going to explain this. And that's like, that's why his cadence goes
3969080	3972760	like up is it's like, because this the thing and like, that's the sound you make when you're,
3972760	3978600	when you're enlightening people. And he's just like, it's like, it's like, go baby, go explain
3978600	3982920	everything. Like, like, like, like, don't even look back. What is that? Peter's going to hate
3983640	3988280	what? What does that port doing with that adapter? He's always talked. He talks about all this weird
3988280	3993960	stuff. Like he's like, he's like, this is a port and it needs an adapter. So who was the adapter?
3993960	3999880	Uh, uh, Adnan's religion plugged perfectly into the port of oppression or something like that.
3999880	4004360	It was really like, he goes really hard, but he says some stuff that like to me was like really,
4004360	4009320	really profound or whatever. Uh, like he, he talked about how like when a healthy person goes
4009320	4013640	on vacation, they just realized that it's a change and they'll return to the normal. But when an
4013640	4018280	unhealthy person goes on vacation, they're looking for an escape from their reality. And when they
4018280	4023560	realize the escape isn't from the, from the problems they actually brought to it, they get upset. And
4023560	4027240	then when they return and things haven't changed, they lose their minds or whatever. And I was like,
4027240	4031880	holy shit. Like this guy's just saying truth. And I like never thought about it. It was like blowing
4031880	4036600	my mind. He was saying, like, people say they drink to forget, but what they're actually doing
4036600	4043400	is a communing with the past. And I was like, Oh, damn, I feel sad now. It was cause I, I, I
4043400	4049000	smell a lot of pot and I was like, Oh fuck, that's me, baby. But it was just like, that's the thing.
4049000	4052520	But a lot of times they're like, you're, you're just being an asshole right now. And other times
4052520	4059080	it's like, Oh man, my life. It's crazy. Do you think we should, he lives in Los Angeles. Let's go.
4059080	4062120	Well, I mean, but I don't know. I don't know what this thing is like. There's this thing I'm doing
4062120	4065880	now. Like I had David coming down and I had the girls from red handed and it's like this tradition
4065880	4072200	of like, Oh, you know, Dan Harmon with Willy Wonka reaches out with his golden tickets into the world
4072200	4078440	and like spoils relationships that, that should really stay maybe consumer relationships. I don't
4078440	4086200	know. I'm like, I felt I might, I'm like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Kim Jong whatever. And, uh, uh,
4086200	4090280	the, uh, the fucking Seth Rogen movie that, that almost caused a nuclear war.
4091240	4095880	Uh, we should look this dude up because I want to know a, does he have a criminology? Is he a
4095880	4099880	background? Is he a writer? All these things that you want to know. Cause if, if he's like,
4099880	4105000	I gotta fill three hours. So of course I'm going to pontificate because I'm a writer. That's great.
4105000	4110680	But if he's like just a lay person who is talking about these things, that's super fascinating.
4113000	4116760	Absolutely. I would have on a heartbeat just because I think they're, you guys listen to
4116760	4122120	Dan Carlin's a hardcore history. Yeah. Where does he live? I don't listen to somewhere.
4122920	4126680	I wonder if he lives like, well, fuck it. I mean, I flew people out from London. I think
4126680	4133240	that's basically, I don't give a shit. I don't give a shit. I'll wipe my ass with this money.
4133240	4137480	Wipe ass. Wipe ass. Wherever Dan Carlin is, like that would be, he would be an amazing guy.
4137480	4137960	George Carlin.
4139320	4143400	It was really interesting. I listened to Dan Carlin and, uh, and I was like, this guy sounds
4143400	4149960	a lot like both Zach Galifianakis and Heath Ledger. And, uh, and then I, and then it made
4149960	4158040	me realize like why they cast he's Zach as the Joker in the Lego Batman movie. I was like,
4158040	4161320	like somebody must've been like, Oh, he sounds a little bit like, don't you think? Yeah. All right.
4161400	4168120	Whatever. I think Dan Carlin sounds like George Carlin. Yeah. And if you just word of advice,
4168120	4172600	cause like, I, I mean, Dan, uh, hardcore history has like, I don't know. There's been a couple
4172600	4177960	episodes where like Cody and I were both like, I kind of, I, I, I don't get it like, and not in
4177960	4182200	a good way. And then it's like, like you can feel it. Don't feel like pressured to like,
4182200	4186280	listen to that one, skip around. I guarantee you'll find one that for whatever reason just
4186280	4190280	gets its hooks in you from the first sentence. And there's no reason for you to not hold out for
4190280	4194680	that. And like, like, like it'll, but it was like a very healthy thing cause I was like, wait,
4194680	4201080	history, it's true crime, but you're kind of learning stuff like this. And they have a ton
4201080	4206040	of forensic evidence so you can get, uh, deep, deep, deep into it. It's always good to sort of
4206040	4209000	shout out to that's what, that's why I asked you, what are you going to be involved in? If you're
4209000	4213560	not going to be, you know, uh, like we all were sort of glued to the politics. This is a great
4213560	4218120	answer. So I definitely, since I left Twitter, like there was, you know, I had withdrawals and
4218120	4222440	stuff like that. And I recently had like a fucking, like I, I had to delete the Reddit app
4222440	4226680	again. Cause I was like in there for a little bit. And then I just found myself for three hours,
4226680	4235880	just like, and I'm like, I deleted it for the good of mankind. But, um, I, I, I got my Instagram,
4235880	4239960	which is a thing where it's like, okay, if you, if you make up thing, that's a minute long,
4239960	4245880	you can put it up here. If somebody underneath it says anything other than I'm really happy that
4245880	4250120	you're happy, um, you can be like, go fuck yourself. And if they say that's how you treat
4250120	4254440	your fans, you can be like, yeah, that is go fuck yourself again. And if they say like that's fucked
4254440	4258280	up and five people come in and say, you're fucked up, I can go like, you're all fucked up. Shut up.
4258280	4263320	I don't care. Like it doesn't feel like it's going to end up in TMZ as much. I don't mean to flatter
4263320	4267480	myself. I'm probably not TMZ material anymore. And I say that with like fucking fingers crossed.
4267480	4272360	Like, I just want to be like, like recoiled a little bit. Like it's cyclical. It's a weird
4272360	4277880	thing of the old social media. You, uh, you, you, you have to take it. It's content driven,
4277880	4283960	you know, like Instagram, like, do you find that Instagram is like, uh, I find it content driven.
4284920	4289400	What do you, what do you, what's going on with you? Just tell us with what just in general,
4289960	4293800	first of all, what the fuck is wrong with you? Come on. Yeah. What's wrong with you? Like,
4293800	4300120	what did your parents do wrong? Well, you, why don't you tell me what's wrong with me? Oh,
4300120	4308520	okay. All right. Uh, here we go. Finally. Finally get to find out. You got the peanut gallery laughing
4308520	4314280	in the background. Sorry, Steve. You're not a peanut. You remember when it was still like,
4314280	4318120	maybe it was never politically correct, but when it was like within bounds, like there was no,
4318120	4322760	like, but like we, I think we talked about it on this show for, I just, it came up in my head again
4322760	4328040	the other day. Like when we were like, we were kids, we were like 20 in Milwaukee and like,
4328680	4332280	like we were just, the improv troop that we were in was all dudes and we were constantly
4332280	4336840	humping each other. Yeah. Like as a bit, I probably to millennial ears makes no fucking
4336840	4341960	sense. Yeah, they do it. I did. You're a contrarian. You just know like millennials
4341960	4346760	hump each other. I do. It's, it's as old as time. There's problematic millennials.
4346760	4352200	I don't, I don't think like millennial dudes that are like in improv troops, like, like, like,
4353080	4359080	hump each other. Like, do you remember, do you remember we would, we would sing the song,
4359080	4365160	get aboard the butt fuck train? I mean, it's just like problematic. Like that, that train's
4365160	4371880	all in the problem of the train. I don't remember that, but I was, and then it was like, you know,
4371880	4378120	one, like Sean was like combing his hair in the bathroom. And I think like you started,
4378280	4383080	you started the train, you started miming, like you were humping him. And then of course I had to
4383080	4389080	get back. And then, and then he would like act like he was like reading the paper, walking,
4389080	4393800	checking the schedule on there. And it was just like another person would join. And then there
4393800	4400200	would be like, it would be, you know, kind of like a camp. What do you call conga line of,
4400200	4405240	but everybody was humping each other. We would be chanting, get aboard the butt fuck train.
4405880	4414520	I, I want to say we did that for maybe hours. It's just that night. Because it never stopped
4414520	4421160	being funny and hilarious because like Sean would be in the front and just like acting like, oh,
4421160	4428680	yeah, he's just doing taxes. I better do this, you know, it's a rite of passage. A millipede of
4429320	4434600	the 20 something. That's why it's problematic is because it's very fratty and like,
4435000	4439080	yeah, it's okay. Whatever. I don't have to problematize it. There's an industry that can
4439080	4443240	do that, but when we were 13, we were like that. And then there was another wave of it.
4443240	4446920	Like when I was 18 with a pack of dudes that I ran with and they called it fixing.
4448120	4452680	Yeah. Yeah. How fucked up is that fixing? Like, I think you need to get fixed. Yeah. We,
4452680	4457720	we're about to come over here and fix you broke and then literally would scoop your legs out from
4457720	4462120	underneath you and pin you. I mean, we were like, it was because the joke becomes like,
4462120	4466360	well, it's a joke. And then it was like, we were like, yeah, it was like the more like,
4466360	4471000	like committed and the more like abusive, like, it was just like, well, what are you,
4471000	4475400	what like who, and it's like, oh, that is like, I look back at that and I go like, well, that's not,
4475400	4479640	you're kind of like actually weeding out, uh, maybe a bunch of funny people who would like,
4480520	4485240	like be like, well, I'm not gonna hang out with those people. Like, and they might be really smart
4485240	4489880	and funny and like, but anyways, but I was, I only brought it up because I just remember like
4489880	4496520	being in the kitchen at my house and my dad, like sitting at the counter and like, I, I know
4496520	4502760	it was just, but it's just amazing. You grabbed me from behind and we're like, pantomiming, like
4502760	4507800	thrusting into me and you, and you, and you, and you, and you helped me by the shoulders and, and,
4507800	4511320	and through clenched teeth said, look at your father while I do this to you.
4511320	4515000	And my dad was like,
4517880	4521720	it was like, I don't expect you to understand, but at the time it was like,
4521720	4525560	like, this is pretty cool. I mean, like, cause it's like, it was, I mean,
4525560	4532840	you kept committing. I was like, and he's like, look at your father, look at your father.
4533800	4538760	And my dad was just like bright red and like, it just had this big grin on his face, which,
4538760	4545640	you know, it was like, it was like, what is wrong with me? What is wrong?
4545640	4551080	We were 20 and it was 1950. I mean, it was like, like, I, I don't, I don't, I don't mean to like,
4551080	4556440	look, I feel like I, like my personal feeling, it's easier because we're older. Like, of course
4556440	4561640	we want to feel this way is that look, I, it's not an excuse, but I do think that there should be a
4561640	4566120	little bit of awareness of like, well, you know, and, and, and, and I look, I gotta actually say
4566120	4570120	like, you know, how many times have I like kind of lambasted my parents for their kind of like,
4570120	4574600	you know, behavior that became unfashionable as of the eighties. And then I was, you know,
4574600	4579880	even on this stage in my, uh, late thirties, like kind of like, Oh, really land, you know,
4579880	4585000	like, I, I kind of like fucking play that card. Like, Oh, they did this, they did that. And like,
4585000	4589640	my mom's excuse was always like, it was the seventies. Everybody did it. Like, you know,
4589640	4595480	like, Oh, like, like now that's what comics are saying, like, about like, we found this thing from
4595480	4600040	1999 when you were at this club doing this thing and we found this sitcom or whatever. And it was
4600040	4605880	like, well, it was on NBC. I don't know what to tell you. And it's like, kind of like neither it's,
4605880	4610680	that doesn't make it good, but at the same time, it's, isn't it sort of like, I guess we're sort of
4610680	4615800	having that debate now, but, uh, it's a shitty thing to go to and shit on the past when you
4615800	4620760	could be fixing things in the present. So it just takes time. It's a shitty thing. But at the time,
4620760	4624280	I will say it just fine. I mean, what is that? If not, like the same thing is like playing heavy
4624280	4629000	metal music really loud. Like we, so, okay. So we weren't like, you know, that we were 20 and it
4629000	4634200	was like, that was the thing that made my dad read. And it wasn't because he was like angry.
4634200	4639720	He didn't feel his thresholds being pushed. It wasn't like, it wasn't like, like, it wasn't,
4639720	4644520	it wasn't like we were like what you weren't emasculating my dad. No, I was embarrassed,
4644520	4649160	but it was, it was about him bear making somebody feel uncomfortable. That was the bet.
4649640	4654760	But my dad's expression was very much like, I don't know how to react to you guys. Like,
4654760	4660200	I don't understand your humor, you know, which I think is a good thing culturally for the,
4660200	4665480	between generations. It was like, you guys are like, I think that people 20 years younger than
4665480	4672280	me should like do comedy that makes me go like, what the fuck? Like, um, which I do see all the
4672280	4678520	time. And I enjoy, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Rob, what do you hear? What do you got to plug? Aren't
4678520	4684680	you doing, you got a Netflix special coming out. No, I don't. You're going on tour. No,
4684680	4688360	come on. Let's play a clip. It's called the Picasso's thumb.
4693400	4699960	What do you think about that? Huh? Ladies, can I talk to you for a second
4700920	4709320	about washing your ass crack. I don't want to hear your butt crumbs in my bedspread.
4712360	4718920	I love you girls, but some of y'all need to wash y'all's ass. Rob, are you doing like a,
4718920	4724360	is that a lot of your older material in that clip? Is that, you know, you, you know, from the,
4724360	4729160	yeah, that's your Def Jam set because you felt like you did good that night. I felt like I did
4729240	4734440	good that night. Listen to the cheering. I did. Well, it was Jeff Jam. And I think you were
4734440	4741400	getting a little bit of a, like, you know, crazy white guy comes out. You kind of did the, you know,
4742360	4745640	I, you know, I think you got a boost. They were being supportive
4747480	4751560	by laughing and applauding. Yeah. Yeah. And like, I don't know if that means that you,
4752520	4760120	did Netflix respond positively to your special? Is it getting good Netflix's? Yeah. Do they have
4760120	4768680	ratings? Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, I don't want to be a negative Gus. Okay. Good. We got another
4768680	4779960	clip. How was, uh, how come Irish people always gotta be running around rainbows?
4781800	4783480	They always rainbow the shit.
4788760	4793880	It sounds like some Def Jam people came to the Netflix auditorium because they remembered you.
4793880	4797240	Yeah. It makes sense that you would play to that crowd. I get that.
4799080	4805160	So is it 45 minutes or what was it? 46 46. Oh, did you do a little sketch in the beginning?
4805160	4811160	Yeah. Did you book open our title sequence? Like you get in a cab and like, I come out
4811560	4814920	of the cab, the cabs on the stage. That's cool. That's pretty cool.
4816120	4820360	I got like the cabs in the video and then you open the cab door and you're on stage. I think
4820360	4827000	that's cool. Were you, were you in Memphis? Was I a Memphis? Were you a Memphis? Were you in Memphis?
4827000	4833240	I was in Memphis. What did you eat? Was there food? How was it? Mentos. Mentos in Memphis.
4833880	4837080	I love that album. Um, how long were you there?
4837080	4844200	Are you being serious? Yeah. No, I was in Atlanta. Okay. So that's near Memphis. Yeah.
4844200	4848760	Okay. How long were you, how long were you going to lie to me? Well, I didn't know if we were doing
4848760	4855720	a bit or not. So forever, probably, uh, I am getting a little, you get this onesie is a onesie
4855720	4860840	plus the lights. I am getting just reporting as a consumer thing. Like it's maybe not designed for
4860840	4865960	sitting under hot lights, but I still, I think, I think they're very comfortable pajamas. How,
4866040	4871160	how was Atlanta? It was not, I didn't see much of it. I was working a lot, but in Memphis,
4871160	4875560	I need to like the traffic lights. What's that? The traffic lights. Aren't they different than us?
4876280	4882280	No, it wasn't Europe. You'd know they are. I've been there. Oh, I didn't notice anything. Well,
4882280	4889160	then you're weird. Spencer, how was Atlanta? Oh, it was great. Oh man. I had a great time.
4889160	4895640	They had traffic lights on strings. I tell you. Oh, is that what you meant? Yeah. Way different
4895640	4900920	than here. I've seen it before, but yeah, it's, it's right. Cause you live somewhere else before
4900920	4907160	here, huh? How many years out are we all right? Well, I see the day before I die where I can
4907160	4914600	safely say I don't enjoy the blues brothers movie. Oh, it's still a couple of years. It sounds like,
4914600	4920280	okay. Yeah. I didn't, I didn't know your generation, you know, I was like, okay. All right. Still. Do
4920360	4925400	you want to talk? Do you want to talk about that? No, no, I'd rather keep my fucking friends and
4925400	4930680	career. So I don't think anyone just as with apocalypse now, I'll go on right on pretending
4930680	4935640	that, Oh wow. Well, wait, has anyone seen a cool choice? Has anyone seen blues brothers here?
4937800	4939880	Fair amount. What'd you think? What'd you guys think?
4941560	4944680	Right. Okay. I think they're trying to trick me.
4945320	4948680	It, I think they all didn't watch it in her line.
4950040	4954760	Did we talk about the stand and Ollie movie up here? I don't think so. No, I haven't watched it
4954760	4963640	yet. So don't ruin that too. Uh, it's pre ruined. All right. Okay. So, all right. So go ahead. That
4963640	4969080	is a piece of shit. Wow. But you do, I don't know. You do love the performances. Yeah, actually. Yeah.
4969080	4974120	Coogan like is me. Yeah. They're both of them, but like, I, I kind of feel like
4974840	4981480	Coogan's doing what's his face like is like, I don't know. It's to me, it seems more impressive.
4981480	4988040	Yeah. Uh, but because maybe it's because I'm a big guy that would probably be between the two
4988040	4993880	of them cast as the other guy. So I feel, and I feel like I'd go, well, what are you doing? Oh,
4994840	5001560	a bowl of cereal, you know, and that's probably easier to do than the other guy. I thought Coogan,
5001560	5007000	Coogan, I couldn't help but think as I was watching it, I was like, I, if I was either of
5007000	5012200	these guys watching this movie at the premiere, I'd be like, like in my seat, like kind of just
5012200	5017880	cringing. Cause I would know that the composer was sitting somewhere in the theater. And as an
5017880	5023000	actor that wasn't in the edit band, I'd be like, I didn't know they were going to play this music
5023000	5028280	from front to back of the tire fucking movie. I feel like you watch them and you imagine the
5028280	5034280	music stripped out. There's all this music that's like, hope these guys are doing something funny
5034280	5041720	now. And which is just fucking death. I'm going to be brutally, brutally honest just because I,
5041720	5048200	like, I don't, please don't. I, I, I, I, when, when I was in the same rock block as 30 Rock,
5048200	5052600	I always thought like 30 Rock would be, that could be like the new Mary Tyler Moore. It was,
5052600	5057960	whatever. It was a great show. Emmy winning very best comedy writers in the, in, in, in, in,
5057960	5063720	in sitcomery. Like the, it's just, it was, it was the funniest show. And I just always felt like,
5063720	5068040	as like, just can he can the tuba just like, it's just, just pull it out. You know,
5068040	5073720	I spent so much time on community going like, like, thank you. Wonderful job. Like that's very
5073720	5077640	clearly that that song makes it very clear that she's walking down the hallway and that she has
5077640	5081880	a secret wish, but like, I can also see it on her face. And I just think that if we just like,
5081880	5087400	get that out of there, that this speeder bike scene in this redwood forest can do the job for itself.
5087400	5097800	And there's nothing worse to me than like, yeah, like somebody doing something quirky in a movie
5097800	5102920	and quirky music playing. It's like, like, what is the, what does the music think we're,
5103560	5108840	think we don't understand? Like, that's crazy. Yeah. I think that music should be like a
5108840	5113640	different channel. You know, it should be like, it should be ironic. Yeah. Well, I mean, it just,
5113640	5122680	by nature, it's technically ironic because, because the music is there to, I just heard you.
5124440	5129960	I gotta work. I did. I tell you like when, when the Sarah Silverman program, sorry, got like
5130040	5137320	canceled. Justin's dad, like we were hanging out with Justin and Justin's dad goes,
5137320	5143560	oh, that's too bad. A show got, got canceled. You should, you should, you should pitch it to channel
5143560	5148280	four. They do a lot of really crazy stuff on channel four. You should, you should really,
5151480	5157080	you should pitch it to channel four. They would put it on channel four. Yeah. That's us now,
5157080	5158120	by the way. Justin Roylan.
5161320	5167080	Channel four. I was curious, like I went to a website cause we were curious. I was like,
5167080	5173800	we were talking about a parking, uh, enforcement and, uh, how, you know, like you've, you've,
5173800	5179880	you've seen them like perched and like waiting. Um, and of course you, then you realize like,
5179880	5184840	oh, they, they must work on a quota. Like there's no way that they just, that you make the same
5184840	5189080	amount of money and get the same amount of respect as a parking enforcement officer. If you
5189080	5193720	come back to the office and be like, everybody parked great today. Like they're going to be like,
5193720	5197720	I don't believe you. Fuck you. Like, so there's now it's, it's one of those unfortunate things.
5197720	5202040	So I went, like people have stories about like, I could see the fucker waiting for me lately,
5202040	5207320	waiting for the car. I'm like, well, they kind of, it's like, yeah, it's like, it's just sad.
5207320	5211400	Like, I mean, but then I heard somebody told me like it's beyond what I even think. It's not even
5211400	5217800	a quota. It's like, like they work on commission, which to me, cross is a line where it's like,
5217800	5221640	well, of course that's going to, that means that to me, when I hear that, that means that they're
5221640	5228760	getting paid less than minimum wage quota. It's like, well, okay, probably a, maybe a necessary
5228760	5236120	evil. I'd be able to argue. Cause like, what are you supposed to do? But like, uh, that commission
5236120	5241560	thing, it's like, it's like, like, oh, this behavior is just like a, it's a door. And then
5241560	5246600	you get these, like, but anyways, I was like, wait, aren't those people all cops? Somebody was
5246600	5250680	telling me this story sort of about, they were watching a guy, they were having coffee. They
5250680	5257320	watch a guy classic story. Some of you have been in it or at least seen it. Uh, the, the meter,
5257320	5262200	the, the meters, five seconds from running out, the parking enforcement person standing there
5262200	5267080	waiting. Um, the, the, they take their pen out. They start writing the thing. They probably use
5267080	5273640	emojis now. I don't know. But, uh, um, the, uh, person runs out. I've been this guy, uh,
5273640	5278200	runs out like, come on, I'm out here with the change in my hand to do anything. We used to
5278200	5284360	have this thing called change and, uh, the, and by the way, misnomer changed nothing. Um,
5284360	5290680	um, the, uh, that laugh made me want to kill myself, but would have preferred silence than
5290680	5296200	that pity. But by the way, that's, that was a facetious statement. If you're having thoughts
5296200	5301480	of self harm, you should talk to somebody. Um, the, uh, uh, the, the, the, the, and then the,
5301480	5304520	you know, they have the big argument cause it's like, Oh, when the pin hits the paper and all
5304520	5309320	this stuff. And, and my friend said that he was there for this, he was watching, he's having
5309320	5314040	coffee, just watching this thing transfixed. And the guy is so frustrated, so outraged.
5314600	5320040	And he shoves the parking lot for parking enforcement person. And the parking enforcement
5320040	5325480	person did not react like, like, like they, it's almost like maybe not. It happens all the time,
5325480	5331720	but they were just like, they didn't react. Like they, they just like cool as a cucumber,
5331720	5339080	like, and they walked over to their thing and got on a CB. And the person was just sitting there
5339080	5346040	having coffee. So they're there 10 minutes later with just like swarms of parking enforcement
5346040	5352840	people, not cops, just all of the, all of the parking enforcement people, like they all got
5352840	5356520	the call, you know, there must be like a code red, like kind of thing where like someone's fucking
5356520	5365800	with the, someone crossed the thin, uh, uh, baby blue line. So they all just start writing tickets.
5365800	5370120	I don't know. Apparently they didn't do anything, but it was just this show of force, which, you
5370120	5374680	know, that's, it was, it was just like, they're like sitting there, like leaning against cars,
5374680	5379160	like looking at the guy and it was like, whoa, wait, aren't they cops? Can't, isn't that assault?
5379160	5383080	And like, no, they're not quite cops. They're officers. So we started like, we got online. We're
5383080	5386520	like, what, how does this work? If you're a parking enforcement, if you've ever worked in
5386520	5391640	parking enforcement, please like you're listening to this. Like, I don't know, fuck right off. No,
5391640	5395640	no. I, we'd love to, I love to talk to you as a guest. I think that would be an amazing guest.
5395640	5401080	I think we'd love to hear your stories and like how that works. I'm not kidding. I mean,
5401160	5404840	don't you think that would be like, if you met a parking enforcement, obviously at a party,
5404840	5409880	wouldn't you be, wouldn't you have like several questions? Um, why are you an asshole? Uh, did
5409880	5416440	you go to college? That's not, they're not here. They're doing a job. No one, no one wants to do.
5416440	5419560	I'm not, I'm not saying like they're all heroes, but I'm just saying like, they're not, come on.
5419560	5426120	I mean, that's, but, but, but, uh, uh, uh, we, we were, I was like, wait, how come I grew up
5426120	5431160	thinking that the only way to become one was to have the, the chief tell you that your high jinks
5431160	5435240	had gone on long enough and that the mayor's calling from downtown. Like I always thought that
5435240	5439640	that's why I never fucked a little, I always thought that like, oh man, these guys are like the
5439640	5443960	worst of the worst cops. Like they're ready to snap. Like, like, like this guy could be,
5443960	5448280	could have been Mark Furman yesterday. Like he's like waiting for me to give him an excuse to put
5448280	5454520	his like holdout, uh, 22 on my body and sprinkle cocaine on my face and just leave me in an alley.
5456280	5460120	The murderer was parked in front of your house and you let him go.
5461080	5466840	And now you're going to be a part of it. That would be a funny bit. Was I, because I was,
5466840	5470040	I was like, ladies, he's like, I'm going to the website. Like, how do you become a parking
5470040	5473960	enforcement officer? And it was like, you couldn't figure it out. And I was like, see,
5473960	5478120	I told you, cause the list is like hidden from the public. And then we started riffing the list.
5478120	5482760	It was like, well, if the mayor is sick of your shit, like, you know, like just the kind of like
5483160	5487480	the prerequisites of becoming a thing in web form would have been funny. Like the bullet points.
5487480	5492040	First, you need a writ from the chief that he's been torn a new asshole.
5494600	5498680	Yeah. And it goes on and on from there. And I'm going to, what am I, Jay Leno? It's not gonna,
5498680	5503800	it's not gonna fly. I didn't really write any of them. I don't care what you think. I'm getting
5503800	5508520	over an approval addiction. It's important for me to tell you to go fuck yourself. It's not,
5508520	5513160	but I don't, I want you to not have to pay for therapy to know that that shouldn't matter to you.
5513880	5518280	I didn't mean it. I'm thinking about myself. Finally.
5525400	5529240	Here's that thing about the stand in Ali movie. Can I warn you about something that is going to
5529240	5534520	like really bum you out? As long as you don't ruin it for me, because I wanted to try to watch it.
5535080	5541400	The stand in Ali movie makes the incredibly curious decision to fade in on the two of them
5541400	5549960	at the peak of their career just before it's over is a cold open. And you see one scene from that.
5549960	5557000	So it's sort of like, this is where things ended. And then it goes to black and it says 16 years
5557960	5569480	later. And the entire movie is them old and failed and failing and dying. And that's the whole movie.
5571720	5581480	Okay. That's kind of what the synopsis of it is. When you when you say when you read about it.
5582200	5586280	I knew that. Okay. So you're going to love it.
5587080	5590360	I don't know yet. Did you not like that about it?
5591400	5597640	I thought it was a strange choice just because, and then you're going to say, Oh, what do you want?
5598520	5602280	You want to see the day they meet. You want to, I'm like, I'm kind of thinking, I'm like,
5602280	5609800	yeah, like, like I'm not, what am I a fucking like Philistine for thinking like, well, okay.
5609800	5615720	Can I make some assumptions here? 90 minutes, a hundred minutes. Uh, give me 20 of, uh, the two
5615720	5621880	of them as individuals, 10 pages each. Like, Oh, like I like show me meeting some meeting across
5621880	5627240	the threshold of them working together. Show them rising to prominence, meet with the goddess and
5627240	5632360	page 60 and fucking like, and then have difficulty start to have and tear them asunder, but then they
5632360	5636840	choose each other over the system. I mean, I like where the story go. I'm not saying like, tell me
5636840	5643080	which story happens, but I'm just saying like that rhythm, like, but I think the problem probably
5643080	5646760	was that they were sort of like the monkeys. I mean, they were assembled, right? I got that
5646760	5651560	implication from the, from the movie that they were placed together. It was sort of like, Oh,
5651560	5656120	you're funny. And you're funny. You guys should do like a fat guy, skinny guy act. Still,
5656120	5660600	even as I say that out loud, I'm like, I'd love to be a fly on the wall of that scene. Yeah.
5660600	5666760	Okay. Because, uh, God, this guy, he, like, I don't know what you want me to say. I was,
5667240	5673880	I purposely didn't watch it because you and Cody said we should watch it. I come back from
5673880	5679160	Atlanta. You watch it. And the last three times we've hung out, you're telling me how
5679160	5689400	shitty it is. I don't even get a chance to watch it untainted. You tainted it. You always tainted my
5689400	5701000	stuff. Why you got a taint so much? One more, one more, please tainter. All right. I'm sorry about
5701000	5707080	that. No, you're not. No, I didn't really, like, I'll tell you the truth. I didn't, I had a chance
5707080	5713320	to watch it and I said, no, we all said we were going to watch it together and that would have
5713320	5719560	been a nice moment. And now we don't have that moment. Cause this motherfucker, he outside
5719560	5725880	throwing rocks and, uh, I said, wolves. Yeah. Maybe that's what's going on. Pencil that into
5725880	5732840	your schedule. Yeah. You're so busy fucking with these coyotes, but you can't be a real friend.
5734920	5739320	The more you know, I like the blues brothers movie. I think it's great. I know. I know.
5739320	5748920	I was really, really inspired Chicago. I watched it with you and you explained the whole time. This
5748920	5753560	is great. Look at this. This is great. I'm like, it seems like a long time to get out of prison.
5754440	5764120	I love it. Yeah. I mean, what's not to love. I don't watch it. There you go. You got one ally.
5764120	5769320	Blues brothers 2000. I'd be interested for people to like watch that without having seen
5769320	5774600	the blues brothers and like watch their face. So they'd just be like, like, I don't know what
5774600	5778280	they would be like though. It was, it's not, it's like, how did this get made? Did I think
5779480	5784520	yeah. So a lot of the audience, I assume was in that position. Yeah. I mean, it's so like,
5784520	5790360	it's so fucking odd. It's so odd. But to me, it kind of, here's the thing about blues brothers 2000,
5790360	5796680	which is directed by the same director. It, to me, part of what blues brothers 2000 does is it,
5796680	5803640	is it shines a spotlight. Here's the thing. The spotlight on blues brothers is indicative of a
5803640	5808920	time in our country's history when people were in love with the blues. But what are the blues?
5808920	5813880	Blue is a color. So I intend to look at the Jompany Ramsey case through the limbs of the
5813880	5818920	chromatic spectrum. There are three kinds of colors that compliment each other. Pink is
5818920	5823960	opposite of blue. Blue is opposite of orange. If you add the three together, you get orange blue.
5825400	5834360	The, uh, I think Burke Ramsey and Gordon Ramsey had an orange orchard. Uh, the, uh, it just,
5834360	5840120	because it's like the second one is like it's shot in HD and it's sort of like, it's definitely
5840120	5848680	very much the most incentivized to recapture the magic of the first one. And it's kind of interesting
5848680	5854360	to me that like, when you try to recapture the magic of the first one, you, you end up with
5854360	5859160	something incredibly confusing. Is it one of those movies where it just sort of like, well, look at
5859160	5863560	them. They were having a good time. Like it's like easy rider. You watch easy rider and you're like,
5863560	5868200	look, I'll take a flyer on this being historical. But to me, it looks like guys dicking around,
5868200	5871800	like, but maybe, but then you find out it was important that they were dicking around. They
5871800	5876280	needed to dick around. It was so important. I was like, okay, so good movie becomes like a little
5876280	5882120	bit, you got one foot out, like, oh, it's a good movie because it said, fuck you to paramount or
5882120	5887000	something. I'm like, can I see that scene in the movie? No, you're going to watch Dennis Hopper do
5887000	5893960	acid in a cemetery. Okay. So paramount hated it. Okay. Well then it's a good movie. I mean, at the
5893960	5898440	time it doesn't really hold up, but at the time it was like a different than your average comedy
5898440	5902920	that was on because they were a little darker and more alternative. The outfits weren't like,
5902920	5907160	you know, you had Robin Williams, so there is that where there's like three, they're Robin. Yeah.
5907160	5912600	No, I can see that. And then there wasn't a lot of shit coming out of Chicago film wise. So there
5912600	5917800	was like a home base win for all the, all the comedians in the scene that was in the Midwest.
5917800	5923400	It'd be like if Dana Gould got famous doing a show in San Francisco, everybody would be like,
5923400	5929320	that fucking show was amazing in San Francisco. So you got diehard Chicagoans spread out in LA
5929320	5934920	and in New York that rep that movie because for them, it's they're like first like,
5934920	5938840	fucking, those are our guys. That's our home team. That's our movie. So they quote it like
5938840	5944120	Star Wars fans do. I mean, this is, yeah, this is all stuff that's not in the movie. It's all
5944120	5949720	stuff that's out smeared outside the movie that it's like, Oh, if you understood how important
5949720	5955400	this movie was to Chicago and to improv and to comedy and to a generation and to things,
5955400	5960120	I read the Saturday Night Live like book, whichever the one was like, well, I don't know,
5960120	5963640	live from New York, like the oral history one that kind of walked you through it. It was sort of
5964440	5970040	semi authorized in that it was like interviews with everybody. And, and that was the part that
5970040	5973960	kind of fascinated me because that was before my time. I mean, I was a little kid. I remember the
5973960	5977720	blues brothers being a thing, but I was like, always sort of like, what's going on with this
5977720	5982120	grown up shit? Like, why are these, why are they be like, mommy, why do they care that that fat man
5982120	5986680	is like doing a somersault? And she'd be like, my mom didn't have, my mom didn't go like, you got
5986680	5991560	to understand Chicago's finally getting its props in the comedy scene. And, and the alternative is
5991560	5996440	Robin Williams. I get my mom was just like, my, my, you know, I think my mom was enjoying the
5996440	6000760	blues brothers and she was probably like, it's just fun for him to dance or something. And I
6000760	6008440	was like, okay, yeah, I, I, I get all that. I'm just sort of like, when do we, when, when are you
6008440	6015240	allowed to be like this movie? I mean, it's just rotten tomatoes. You can, you can, you can,
6015240	6023080	you can say you don't like the movie anytime. Yeah. You could say anytime. I don't like this
6023080	6029560	movie. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. Go ahead. You know, it's growing on me.
6031160	6036600	Oh shit. I like the nun scene. I like how hard she hits them. And there's Aretha Franklin.
6037480	6042600	Yeah. That's hilarious. Who could forget she really sang that song.
6047560	6052680	Yeah. Should we have John Landis as a guest? We could, we could get him for sure.
6053800	6057640	He's a big community fan. He gave me, he was, he was, he was, he gave me the most flattering
6057640	6062680	community compliment. You watched cannibal run. Yeah. I liked cannibal run when I was a kid. I
6062760	6065800	don't know if I've never, I don't know. When's the last time we watched cannibal run? Oh, we,
6065800	6069080	we watched it. But I definitely wouldn't. Yeah. I think we've watched it as adults.
6069080	6073000	And we're just like, you guys are so fucking choked out. Here's the thing. That's what it
6073000	6081080	reminds me of. Here's the thing. So summer that cannibal run comes out is also the same summer as
6082280	6090280	Raiders of the Lost Ark comes out. And I'm about to go to the movies and my, and my, and my next
6090360	6096680	door neighbor, uh, Shelly Lipke says, don't go see Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's so gross.
6097320	6104120	They, they have people melting at the end. Go see cannonball run. Best movie of the year.
6104120	6110840	Go see people melting for the entire movie. Yeah. Go see cannonball run. Best movie of the year.
6110840	6117560	And I was like, well, all right then. And I sit down and I watch it and I go, well that,
6117560	6122440	I don't know if it was the best movie of the year, but I thought it was okay. I thought it was all
6122440	6129720	right. So I never saw Raiders in the theater until I never saw it in the theater. I had to wait till
6129720	6136120	it, and I didn't see it in cave because we didn't have cable. I had to wait till it came out on VHS.
6136120	6142440	That was the first time. That's the only time I saw it. Yeah. And here's the other one. And this
6142440	6151800	one, I can't blame on anybody. Same year, same summer back to the future came out was also the
6151800	6160040	same summer that Transylvania six, five thousand came out. And I went Jeff Goldblum's funny. Yeah.
6160040	6169400	I'm going to go see it and enjoy myself. Watched it and loved it. Smiled from ear to ear. Thought
6169400	6175080	every joke landed perfectly. I thought it was hilarious. I walked out. I was quoting it for
6175080	6180520	weeks and people kept saying, you didn't see back to the future. I'm like, what? I can watch Michael
6180520	6190040	J Fox on television. I'm seeing Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr goofing off in Transylvania. This is
6190040	6197400	gold. I'm telling you. I was, I haven't seen, I missed out on seeing back to the future in the
6197400	6202760	theater. I dragged my friends to see Spaceballs. I was like, you don't get it. Like this guy's the
6202760	6207240	master of comedy. He made Young Frankenstein. Fuck. And he's been, I mean, like he's been doing
6207240	6210360	a Star Wars movie. This is going to be amazing. And my friends walked out there like, what the
6210360	6216440	fuck is wrong with you? I can't look I, but I remember going with my friends. I was, I was,
6216440	6222200	we were still not 17. I don't know what we were, but we wanted to see Beverly Hills Cop two.
6222200	6227080	And we went to the theater. We bought the tickets to project X with Matthew Broderick. It's about
6227080	6235560	monkeys getting irradiated. And, and Matthew Broderick dealing with it. And we went into the
6235560	6242200	Beverly Hills Cop two theater. There was, it was like the, it was sold out. So we were like three
6242200	6248280	12 year olds sitting in the aisle in a rated R movie. So it wasn't long before we got ushered.
6249560	6255240	And we got ushered into the theater that we bought tickets for. We started watching project X,
6255240	6259800	which I had now missed the first 10 minutes of, but I was immediately fucking enthralled by,
6259800	6264040	because it's Matthew Broderick dealing with the slow realization that he's in charge of these
6264040	6267800	monkeys. And they're, they're, they're, they're the experiments that they're doing on them.
6267800	6271480	He's supposed to take care of them in the cages. He's like basically a janitor in charge of these
6271480	6274760	monkey cages. And he's like, these monkeys are super smart. And he's like falling in love with
6274760	6278600	them. And there's like a monkey trainer there. And then he like, he's like the threshold is him
6278600	6282280	finding out, he like hangs out long enough to realize and watch what they're doing. They're
6282280	6286440	putting these chimpanzees in these, these little like model planes. And then like, they're
6286440	6291880	basically like using them to test how far you can be away from an atomic bomb after it drops
6291880	6296200	before without getting cancer. So they're just irradiating the monkeys, like zapping them with
6296200	6300520	radioactivity. And like, like Matthew Broderick has to deal with finding out that that's his job,
6300520	6304520	that his friends that he's making these monkeys are like, I know they're apes. I don't want to
6304520	6313960	get letters from apes. They don't have tails or whatever. But, but, and I was like, and then my
6313960	6320680	friends were like, God damn it. Like they, they're like in detention watching these monkeys. And I'm
6320680	6325560	just like, God damn this soundtrack. Oh, Matthew Broderick. It's like, I haven't seen a performance
6325560	6329640	like this since Ferris Bueller. Like this guy, like to Ferris Bueller, like there's a heart.
6330520	6338360	These monkeys to die. The soundtrack was like, whoa, whoa, whoa. And I was like, like, like
6338360	6343560	holding back tears and like, and they're like, coast is clear. Let's go back and watch Eddie Murphy,
6343560	6351160	like fucking like run around. And I was like, um, you guys go on without me. And they were like,
6351160	6356680	are you serious? And I was like, yeah, whatever. I don't want to get bounced again. But I was like,
6356680	6361160	I don't want to watch Beverly Hills cop two. I want to watch monkeys get irradiated and cry.
6361160	6365080	And I'm glad you're leaving because now I can, now I can fucking not hold back because I'm the only
6365080	6368680	one in the theater because everyone wants to watch Eddie Murphy. I'm going to fucking like,
6368680	6374360	like fucking shoot tears out of my ducks, like lasers and see what that feels like.
6375160	6378680	And I did. And you know what it felt like? Getting humped by Rob.
6378680	6387560	You know, you have those little stories where you kind of like, I'm different from my friends.
6387560	6392440	I think I'm going to, I think I'm going to skip the next sleepover. Maybe, maybe I'll
6392440	6397320	tell, maybe I'll do like one or two this next month. When's the last time you seen
6397320	6402360	Transylvania six, five thousand? I don't, I don't, I think, I mean, I like movies like that.
6402360	6407960	I've only seen an adulthood like so drunk and high that I have no, I know we watched it, but
6407960	6414200	I watched it last, I watched it about a year ago, which was the second time I ever watched.
6414200	6419640	The first time I watched it was in the theater, like many moons ago. And then I watched it
6419640	6425160	recently. It's like, ah, to give you guys context, the comedy team of Goldblum and Begley jr.
6428280	6432920	That's it. Like they paired them like that was a thing. Like, like,
6432920	6437480	Goldblum, Begley jr. Run, don't walk too.
6439880	6446280	But it, but I remember I watched it and I was like, I remembered every single joke
6447000	6454760	and I found it to be very funny. I found it to be a quality evening of entertainment.
6456360	6459880	And I, I would like to watch it again. I think I'm going to watch it again.
6459960	6464840	I remember the opening is funny cause it's like, uh, it opens like a cold open and it's like, uh,
6464840	6470120	found footage way before that was a thing. Like, no, this is, this is decades before Blair, which
6470120	6476760	was sort of like your opening just in like VHS footage, um, which was, it's weird. And then like,
6476760	6482120	it's just people going like, Oh man, this is fun. Oh cool. Like, what are you doing?
6482120	6486120	Damien, like, Oh, I'm having to kill. It's drinks and beers or something like big foot attacks him
6486120	6490040	or something like that. Yeah. And they're like, whoa, it's big foot run. And it's like, but it's
6490040	6494200	kind of like hokey, like, like it feels fake. And then it comes out and they're at a newspaper
6494200	6498920	office or something. And yeah. And they're like, yeah, it's, it's, it was like the, one of the
6498920	6502360	first ones to say like, you guys allergic to boredom. We should wrap up the show.
6504280	6510680	Most people just do nothing and slowly stop coming. It's, it's helpful to have somebody
6510680	6518680	that's actually like, I reject this. It's too boring, boring. I'm sorry. What were you saying?
6521400	6526520	What happened to Spence? Oh, he's just, he's bored to death. He died. I'm dead. Brandon,
6526520	6532200	you still alive. I'm still alive. All right. Let's, uh, like, like, let's do a rap. Yeah. You know,
6532200	6539160	I mean, what do you, what do you mean? Like that we could talk about. Let's talk about D and D.
6539560	6544680	Seven minutes. Well, it's just, we gotta, we gotta figure out a plan. Yeah. Should we ever,
6544680	6549560	I mean, like, what do we do? Jeff's Jeff's now out of town for, right? Like,
6551640	6556520	I mean, I'm fine either way. Hey, okay. I, I just wanted to make sure. No, no, it's cool.
6558280	6565160	If not, then let's, uh, show your dick to me. Wow. And he's whispering it into the microphone.
6565880	6574040	Wow. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Yeah. Like six years from now, man. You're going down in flames for this.
6574680	6584760	Oh no. Oh no. Now I'm going to go down. What? What? They're never going to hire you when you're
6584760	6597640	72. Oh no, I'm never going to get hired again. Oh no. How's it going on your, uh, uh, are we allowed
6597640	6602680	to talk about you working with, uh, you can't, I can't, I can't say, I can't say who everyone
6602680	6608680	that's working on it can Instagram it. Yeah. Well, they're not supposed to. Okay. I can say,
6608680	6612360	I can, I can say, all right. Well, I can't talk about Cody. Cody got her, uh,
6612520	6617480	Cody's doing a show with quibi and Anna Kendrick is playing her in her autobiographical. Is this
6617480	6622840	dummy? Yeah. Congrats. And they got, they got, it looks like they may have finally found a Dan
6622840	6630760	Harmon, but I'm not allowed to say until, until he's cast Ben Affleck as do not hold my past. He
