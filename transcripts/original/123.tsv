0	2000	Thank you very much.
2000	4000	Thank you.
4000	6000	Thank you.
26000	28000	Good evening, Austin.
29000	31000	I'm Lou Herbert.
33000	36000	And you can't disappoint a picture!
40000	42000	So...
42000	54000	Here we go!
54000	59000	Ladies and gentlemen, Harman Town is officially in session.
61000	68000	It is rare that I get the opportunity to introduce true genius.
68000	78000	Please bring to the stage the mayor of Harman Town, Mr. Dan Harman!
78000	82000	Please welcome the mayor of Harman Town.
95000	98000	Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're looking for a place to put your bag?
98000	102000	You got the podium, that's your comptroller podium.
102000	106000	Yeah, yeah. You're in a position of high stature.
106000	111000	Your job is to keep me from going off on too many tangents.
111000	115000	Or you can just sit and listen, that's fine too.
115000	120000	In any case, it's a huge, huge honor to have you here, guest comptroller LaVar Burton.
122000	124000	I'm looking at my...
124000	132000	I mean, I'm a child of the 70s, so my mom learned about race from Alex Haley.
134000	140000	And, like, my consciousness of race began when my mom...
140000	146000	I was playing with Sesame Street figures that I was playing.
146000	149000	I've told this story quite a bit, because it just sort of...
149000	158000	For me, it summarizes, like, as a 41-year-old, a white-gilt-driven liberal in the modern era,
158000	161000	this is my origin story.
161000	166000	I was playing with a Gordon figure from Sesame Street and a Mr. Whipple figure,
166000	170000	and my mom was watching me play with them, and then she said,
173000	176000	Do you know the difference between those two?
177000	180000	And I said, I don't know, I don't know the difference.
180000	182000	And she said, Good.
184000	189000	And then, and if she had only stopped there, but she just...
189000	191000	And then I kept playing, and then she went,
191000	194000	Because the difference is one of them is black and one of them is white,
194000	197000	and there's going to be people that try to tell you that there's a difference,
197000	200000	and that's important, and you need to ignore them, and blah, blah, blah.
200000	203000	And then my mom would watch, like, miniseries about the Holocaust,
203000	205000	and then she'd wake me up, and she'd sit on the foot of the bed,
205000	208000	and she'd say, Wake up, wake up, what's going on?
208000	211000	Daniel, one day people are going to tell you something called the Holocaust
211000	213000	never happened.
213000	215000	It happened. It happened.
215000	217000	And then she'd go to bed.
218000	220000	I was a child of the 70s.
222000	226000	LeVar Burton, before he was raising all of you via Reading Rainbow,
226000	228000	he was...
231000	233000	His first dramatic role.
233000	237000	You're literally your first thing that you ever auditioned for.
237000	240000	You started being an actor, you went on your first audition,
240000	244000	and it was for the role of a character named Kunta Kinte
244000	247000	in an adaptation of Alex Haley's Roots,
247000	253000	and you got the part, and we're at the forefront of a transition
253000	257000	that was happening in the 70s, of which Norman Lear was a part,
257000	260000	which I was, like, caught in the maelstrom of,
260000	262000	where my brain was warped by.
262000	265000	And now we live in this 21st century where...
265000	268000	I don't know. I don't even know how to talk to the kids anymore.
268000	272000	Now I'm racist because I actually am fascinated with this stuff.
272000	274000	That makes me racist.
274000	279000	But you were making my mom think it was okay for all of us
279000	283000	to occupy the world together, and make it okay for her to warp my brain,
283000	288000	and then also teaching everybody to read with this awesome show.
288000	291000	It was mostly the theme song. Let's not kid ourselves.
297000	300000	It's like that kind of flangey reverb.
300000	302000	Who did that? Who composed that?
302000	305000	That is the work of Steve Horlick,
305000	308000	the composer of the Reading Rainbow theme song.
308000	311000	We call it Butterfly in the Sky.
311000	317000	And the vocals on the original version of the Reading Rainbow theme song
317000	320000	was done by the very talented Tina Fabrique.
323000	327000	But we all heard that song, and then we were all drawn to the TV,
327000	331000	like Fred Flintstone being drawn by the smell of bronto burgers.
331000	338000	Like kids who otherwise, their brains would have just rotted for want of literacy.
338000	340000	Shall we sing the song, Dan?
342000	344000	You know what we ought to do?
345000	348000	You don't have that. Can you cue that up, Dustin?
348000	352000	Can you find the Reading Rainbow theme somehow and cue it up?
352000	355000	There's got to be a way to do a kind of like,
355000	360000	we do the song and there's got to be a way to do a rap bridge or something.
362000	364000	I'm trying to think of how the song goes.
364000	368000	There's got to be a way I can bastardize your work.
368000	371000	If it's possible, Dan, you will figure it out.
372000	374000	But I mean, I don't know.
374000	378000	You were a founding father of my consciousness,
378000	380000	and I was reading your Wikipedia.
380000	382000	Those are the ways that I was familiar with you.
382000	385000	But then today, because it was like, oh, he's coming to do the show.
385000	387000	I better not embarrass myself.
387000	389000	I should familiarize myself with LaVar Burton's career.
389000	391000	So I Wikipedia'd you.
391000	394000	And I'm sure meanwhile you were googling me and going,
394000	396000	what's wrong with Chevy Chase?
396000	398000	Who is this?
398000	399000	Who is this?
399000	400000	I don't understand.
400000	401000	Where am I going?
401000	402000	I don't know.
402000	406000	By the way, LaVar is only here because he was signing his children's book,
406000	409000	The Rhino That Swallowed the Storm, which just came out.
409000	412000	He was here in Texas and we were able to get him this.
415000	416000	Also, he's honored to be here.
416000	417000	Honored to be here.
417000	418000	I am. No, no, no, no.
418000	419000	That's true.
419000	426000	If I may, if I may, Mr. Harmon, you are responsible, sir,
426000	431000	for one of the most satisfying and fulfilling professional experiences
431000	432000	of my career.
432000	433000	We did it.
437000	440000	It's only because I let you use your eyes.
440000	441000	That's it.
442000	446000	It would have been Star Trek, but they put a fucking visor on your face.
447000	449000	You showed up the first day, you were like, oh my God,
449000	451000	I'm the new Chekhov or Spock or Sulu.
451000	452000	I don't know who I am.
452000	453000	I'm the new something.
453000	455000	And then you're like, okay.
455000	460000	They put a banana clip on my eyes and it was all over.
461000	463000	Well, yeah, I'm smart that way.
463000	464000	Yeah.
464000	467000	But eventually he, yeah, I don't know.
467000	469000	What was that?
469000	473000	I mean, I remember I saw the Trekkies documentary when you have the soundbite.
473000	475000	You're like, give the actor his eyes.
477000	479000	Did I actually say that?
479000	481000	Did I say it that way?
481000	482000	Well, okay.
483000	485000	Maybe that was an unflattering impression.
485000	487000	That's sort of my actor impression.
487000	490000	But I mean, I could see how that would be a tremendous bummer.
490000	492000	Did you ever get adjusted to it?
492000	496000	Or was there in the storyline that when they lost the visor
496000	499000	and replaced it with the context, was that a result of you?
499000	500000	Okay.
500000	501000	He's nodding.
502000	503000	Yes.
503000	505000	That was you constantly every day.
505000	506000	Yeah.
506000	509000	Like JJ Abrams is like, why is my car keyed again?
510000	517000	Yeah, I was very insistent that and Rick Berman, the executive producer,
517000	519000	was and he was right.
519000	523000	The visor was one of the ways that we telegraphed the technological sophistication
523000	525000	of the 24th century.
525000	528000	And I always figured, well, if we're so damn sophisticated,
528000	533000	why can't we just put it in a smaller kind of, you know?
533000	535000	Yeah.
535000	536000	Yeah.
537000	538000	Yeah.
538000	542000	I remember in that documentary talking about the idea that it was like,
542000	543000	it was supposed to be very symbolic.
543000	546000	There was a blind man that was at the helm of the ship.
546000	547000	Yes.
547000	548000	Blind man flying the ship.
548000	549000	Yeah.
559000	561000	One thing I was really excited to talk to you about, though,
561000	564000	that I knew nothing about your childhood.
564000	569000	It said that when you were 13 years old, you went to seminary school.
569000	570000	Yes.
570000	571000	You were raised Catholic.
571000	572000	I was.
572000	573000	First of all, born in Germany.
573000	576000	We should probably put a pin in that because that's distracting.
577000	578000	You were born in Germany.
578000	580000	We'll get back to that.
581000	585000	But raised Catholic and when you were 13, you went to seminary school,
585000	587000	you had every intention of being a priest.
587000	588000	I did, yeah.
588000	592000	And then in high school, it says in your Wikipedia,
592000	594000	I don't think that I don't assume this is accurate.
594000	597000	But I was like, oh, my God, I can't wait to do it.
597000	602000	It says, I can't remember the exact quote, but it says starting to have doubts
602000	607000	in the Catholic faith after being exposed to the works of Lao Tzu.
609000	610000	Is that true?
610000	611000	Taoism was a thing for you.
611000	615000	Kierkegaard, Lao Tzu, the Dao De Jing.
615000	616000	Nietzsche.
616000	617000	Nietzsche.
617000	618000	I call him Nietzsche.
618000	619000	Yeah.
620000	621000	The Nietzsche.
623000	628000	I mean, the Dao De Jing was a huge thing for me in high school.
628000	632000	I was searching and searching and I found the Dao De Jing.
632000	633000	Right.
633000	635000	And it was like a tremendous...
635000	639000	That and Kurt Vonnegut, those were like these huge things for me.
639000	640000	Right.
640000	644000	And it's so interesting when you're a kid, when you're in your adolescent years,
644000	646000	like anything could happen to you.
647000	649000	And then there's these libraries that are filled with these...
649000	650000	It was books.
650000	651000	Yeah.
651000	652000	It was literature.
652000	654000	And it's not always the books that your teachers are assigning you to read.
654000	655000	Some of those are great.
655000	656000	Right.
656000	657000	A lot of those are great.
657000	658000	Some of them are banned.
660000	663000	But also in those same libraries, there's these other books.
663000	664000	That's right.
664000	666000	By these profane, horrible...
666000	667000	Profane and profound.
667000	671000	Dissidents or ancient non-Christian mystics.
671000	672000	Right.
673000	677000	Kurt Vonnegut slammed my brain against the wall,
677000	679000	smeared it like jelly all over the place.
679000	680000	He has that power.
680000	681000	Yeah.
682000	686000	Him and David Mamet encountering his plays.
686000	689000	I was like, are you allowed to write like this?
689000	692000	And one of my drama teachers, Mrs. Lund at Brown Deer High School,
692000	695000	she's like, yeah, I think that's a thing that you can do if you're...
695000	696000	I got a woo for Mrs. Lund.
696000	697000	Right.
699000	700000	I'm kind of babbling.
701000	702000	This has happened to you a lot.
702000	704000	I think a lot of people probably encounter you
704000	708000	and there's a strange sort of like Mr. Rogers meets Sting.
711000	715000	People want to fuck you and please you,
715000	717000	but also don't want to offend you
717000	720000	and like kind of like bowing a little bit while they're like...
720000	722000	I feel that energy happening.
722000	724000	I'm like, hey, I don't want LaVar Burton to leave mad.
725000	730000	But yeah, I just wanted to know that I really liked Vonnegut in high school.
733000	737000	But the Dao De Jing, talk about the world's oldest book.
738000	743000	And it was my drama coach, Lee Bartlett, who was neither a priest or a brother.
743000	744000	He was a layman.
749000	751000	It was the Catholic seminary after all.
755000	756000	Put on pump.
758000	762000	It was Lee who was the drama teacher and he was the philosophy teacher.
762000	763000	He taught all my favorite subjects.
763000	767000	He taught English and he had the book list
767000	771000	that really changed my course and direction in life.
771000	773000	How many people in this room...
773000	775000	Save your applause until I finish the question.
776000	778000	There's probably 200 people in this room.
778000	782000	How many people feel that them being in this room
782000	786000	and being who they are owes itself in a major way
786000	790000	to one teacher in their public education path?
792000	795000	That's a good 40%, 60%.
796000	797000	It's important.
797000	801000	Teachers, they're very low paid and very vomited upon.
802000	803000	Unfairly so.
805000	807000	I didn't bother to Google what your politics are,
807000	810000	but I assume you and I both agree that we should probably take a lot of money
811000	814000	and put it over into education and hope that that solves everything.
814000	818000	We have spent way too much money on war
818000	821000	and the machineries of war in the past two decades
821000	825000	and we've sacrificed two generations of our nation's children in their education.
831000	834000	Are you about to pour yourself another drink there, Mr. Harmon?
834000	835000	Yeah, yeah, I am.
835000	836000	Can I join you?
836000	837000	Oh, okay, yeah.
838000	840000	That could have gone one of two ways.
841000	843000	I thought it was an intervention for a second.
853000	855000	If I use my shirt and you'll see my belly and...
855000	857000	I guess you know I'm fat, so...
862000	864000	I wish I had a watermelon.
864000	866000	I wish I had a watermelon.
867000	869000	I wish I had a watermelon.
870000	871000	That's a deep cut.
873000	874000	All right.
879000	881000	You are probably too young to remember,
881000	884000	but there was an episode of Little Rascals.
884000	885000	Do you know the Little Rascals?
888000	892000	Where Spanky, or maybe it was...
893000	894000	No, it was Spanky.
894000	895000	No, it was Spanky.
897000	902000	It was rubbing Buckwheat's stomach saying,
902000	905000	I wish I had a watermelon.
905000	908000	I wish I had a watermelon.
908000	910000	And you just inspired me, Dan.
914000	916000	Yeah, finally we got there.
920000	921000	What are you...
925000	927000	There's a quote from you.
927000	929000	I'm just going to pull up your Wikipedia page.
931000	932000	In my own defense,
932000	935000	Wikipedia used to say that I lived in Nova Scotia,
936000	939000	which I have yet to have the pleasure of visiting.
941000	944000	But there is a quote from you on your Wikipedia page.
944000	945000	It's in the...
945000	946000	That's Henry Silva's entry,
946000	948000	because I saw a waiter that looked like him.
955000	958000	God damn it.
958000	962000	This is dead air, but we will edit it out.
963000	967000	LeVar Burton, Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
968000	972000	There's a picture of you in the middle of a very terse statement
972000	975000	in your Wikipedia picture.
975000	977000	See, career.
977000	979000	There's a quote from you.
985000	987000	Now I can't find it.
993000	995000	Ah, okay.
996000	999000	Here, you read it, because if I read it, it's weird now.
1000000	1002000	Do you need your...
1002000	1004000	I have five spectacles.
1004000	1005000	It says,
1005000	1007000	Burton reprised the role of Kunta Kinte
1007000	1010000	in the 1988 television film Roots, The Gift.
1010000	1012000	When asked about the societal impacts of Roots,
1013000	1015000	Burton is quoted as...
1035000	1037000	So that was...
1038000	1041000	That's slow and steady wins the race, kind of like...
1047000	1049000	I don't know how to phrase the question.
1049000	1050000	What I want to ask you is,
1050000	1053000	are young people as annoying to you as they are to me?
1055000	1058000	Do they seem to have somehow lost something?
1060000	1062000	In the 70s, weren't we closer to something?
1062000	1064000	Have we taken backward steps?
1065000	1068000	I do believe the change is sometimes two steps forward,
1068000	1069000	a step backward.
1069000	1072000	It's hard to see the forest for the trees,
1072000	1076000	but in my own defense, the paragraph after that,
1076000	1079000	I mean the very next words go on to talk about,
1079000	1081000	after that very pithy quote,
1081000	1084000	talks about my work in Fantasy Island.
1085000	1086000	It's very true, yeah.
1086000	1088000	And Battle of the Network Stars.
1088000	1091000	So there's that, Dan.
1091000	1093000	Well, it's not your job to be a symbol.
1093000	1095000	You weren't born and your parents didn't say,
1095000	1097000	can he please be a symbol?
1097000	1101000	But you are a symbol.
1101000	1104000	Most of what you do is symbolic.
1104000	1107000	Your role in reading Rainbow is symbolic.
1107000	1110000	By the way, I'm all over the place,
1110000	1114000	but we should say congratulations to him.
1114000	1117000	Reading Rainbow, which won 26 Emmys
1117000	1120000	throughout its eight-billion-year career.
1120000	1122000	He's the executive producer of it.
1122000	1126000	Then it finally, I don't even want to say the word died,
1126000	1131000	but it passed its natural mortal phase.
1131000	1133000	No child left behind.
1133000	1135000	No, seriously, no child left behind was responsible
1135000	1137000	for reading Rainbow being taken off the air.
1137000	1138000	How is that?
1138000	1140000	Because the federal government made a choice
1140000	1142000	between teaching children how to read
1142000	1145000	and fostering in them a love of a written word.
1146000	1149000	My brain just exploded.
1149000	1152000	You're the community of child literacy.
1152000	1155000	Right?
1155000	1157000	I was canceled because the Nielsen system
1157000	1159000	doesn't measure real audiences anymore.
1159000	1160000	Exactly right, sir.
1160000	1164000	And so like me, kind of, you have taken your shit online.
1164000	1165000	Yeah.
1165000	1167000	Like you did a Kickstarter.
1167000	1171000	Their goal was a couple million.
1171000	1174000	And in three days, they made like five million.
1174000	1177000	Because everybody in America,
1177000	1180000	from $50 donors to million-dollar donors
1180000	1182000	like Seth MacFarlane, which kind of mitigates
1182000	1183000	my feelings about him.
1183000	1184000	Good job.
1184000	1185000	Right?
1185000	1186000	I have to be jealous of him.
1186000	1187000	I have to be.
1187000	1188000	You don't have to be.
1188000	1189000	Yes, I do.
1189000	1191000	Okay, fine.
1191000	1194000	He's very successful and sings well,
1194000	1198000	and my narcissism makes me think
1198000	1201000	I'm in competition for that corner?
1201000	1203000	Doesn't even make any sense.
1203000	1206000	Why wouldn't I eat less cookies?
1206000	1208000	Why do I get up in the morning and go,
1208000	1210000	I got to beat Seth MacFarlane?
1210000	1215000	Motherfucker jog.
1215000	1217000	These are the kinds of things I want to confess
1217000	1218000	to LaVar Burton.
1218000	1221000	He's the father to a generation.
1221000	1225000	Anyways, you have obviously successfully resurrected
1225000	1227000	reading Rainbow in a...
1227000	1228000	Thanks to you all.
1228000	1231000	Thanks to you, we have.
1231000	1232000	Thank you.
1232000	1234000	All right, let's talk about Austin.
1234000	1235000	Huh?
1235000	1236000	Yeah.
1236000	1237000	What about the city?
1237000	1239000	There's a governor's race here.
1239000	1240000	Is there?
1240000	1241000	Yeah.
1241000	1242000	Yeah.
1242000	1243000	I was...
1243000	1245000	Five minutes of putting on new underwear
1245000	1247000	in the hotel room,
1247000	1249000	letting the governor's ads play.
1249000	1251000	I noticed there's like...
1251000	1253000	I think it might be a conservative state.
1253000	1258000	It feels like Austin may be a little bit
1258000	1262000	of an oasis in the middle of a red sea.
1262000	1265000	A red desert.
1265000	1266000	Seems like...
1266000	1269000	But you guys have a governor candidate.
1269000	1273000	I was talking with your peeps here
1273000	1274000	in the green room.
1274000	1276000	So there's this kind of funny...
1276000	1277000	Maybe it's not funny to them.
1277000	1279000	It's funny to an outsider.
1279000	1282000	There's a liberal candidate, Wendy Davis.
1282000	1284000	And there's...
1284000	1289000	And there's the conservative candidate, Greg Abbott.
1289000	1291000	Here's the twist.
1291000	1299000	It's 2014, so the conservative candidate
1299000	1301000	is in a wheelchair.
1301000	1304000	Greg Abbott, conservative as he is,
1304000	1306000	wheelchair bound.
1306000	1309000	How do you get more liberal than that?
1309000	1312000	The man is in a wheelchair.
1312000	1316000	It stinks of... of... of... of... of leftism.
1317000	1322000	He's the embodiment of... of... of altruism.
1322000	1323000	He's in a wheelchair.
1323000	1325000	He's in a wheelchair.
1328000	1329000	Someone shouted something out,
1329000	1331000	but then more notably someone next to him went...
1331000	1333000	Shh!
1336000	1338000	So Wendy Davis, who...
1338000	1340000	I got quickly surprised.
1340000	1342000	She's kind of a hero in liberal politics.
1342000	1345000	If you buy into the bipartisan garbage,
1345000	1347000	which I kind of am very jaded about,
1347000	1350000	I kind of feel like everybody's just all the same thing.
1350000	1352000	I don't care that much.
1352000	1353000	But...
1353000	1355000	But if you... if you...
1355000	1358000	I mean, if you choose to choose sides
1358000	1360000	between the Democrats and the Republicans,
1360000	1362000	obviously the Democrats are the good guys.
1362000	1363000	That's a no-brainer.
1363000	1366000	And Wendy Davis, like, she did a big filibuster.
1366000	1368000	They were trying to pass some horrible abortion stuff,
1368000	1370000	and she, you know, she stood her ground.
1370000	1371000	And she's...
1371000	1374000	She is... she is one of the good guys within that paradigm.
1374000	1376000	Not with a Noam Chomsky's paradigm.
1376000	1381000	She's a tool of the marginalization of the proletariat
1381000	1385000	by virtue of, you know, feeding you bullshit binary,
1385000	1389000	which has slowly withered our capacity for dissent.
1389000	1391000	She's part of the problem.
1391000	1392000	But...
1392000	1395000	Let's just say she's one of the good guys.
1395000	1399000	Because everybody knows that abortion and gay stuff
1399000	1401000	and everything...
1401000	1403000	Very important for the last 40, 50 years or so.
1403000	1404000	Have you noticed?
1404000	1407000	This is very crucial stuff in every fucking election
1407000	1409000	where you're just electing a bunch of rich people
1409000	1411000	whose jobs to tell you what to do.
1411000	1414000	Wendy Davis ran an ad.
1414000	1416000	It seemed kind of benign,
1416000	1418000	where she was showing these shots.
1418000	1420000	This is the funny world we live in now.
1420000	1424000	It's 2014, so there's this Wendy Davis governor ad
1424000	1427000	where they're showing these shots of a wheelchair.
1427000	1429000	And... and...
1429000	1432000	Actually, the point that her ads are making
1432000	1435000	are that this guy that's in this wheelchair...
1435000	1438000	The reason he's in a wheelchair is because he had this accident
1438000	1441000	and he actually kind of famously is the beneficiary
1441000	1444000	of a very litigious kind of pursuit.
1444000	1445000	Like, he got injured.
1445000	1447000	He made a lot of money by suing.
1447000	1450000	And now he's a foremost advocate for kind of putting a cap on that stuff.
1450000	1451000	That was the point of her ad.
1451000	1456000	It was like he sides with hospitals in, like, this kind of stuff.
1456000	1459000	And the ad was just sort of trying to say he's a hypocrite.
1459000	1460000	But the visuals...
1460000	1463000	It's like Herman Cain running for president.
1463000	1464000	Yeah.
1464000	1469000	The visuals kind of, like, allowed the conservatives to go,
1469000	1471000	you're picking...
1471000	1473000	Why aren't you showing that wheelchair?
1473000	1475000	You're just saying he's crippled.
1475000	1477000	And so it's just a very funny time in Texas.
1477000	1479000	That's it.
1479000	1481000	It's just funny to me, like...
1481000	1482000	I don't know.
1482000	1484000	She's the bully because she's a Democrat.
1484000	1486000	She ran an ad and it's got a wheelchair in it.
1486000	1489000	And she tried.
1490000	1493000	And I said, why is Texas...
1493000	1496000	Why is it a red state when you go to a city like Austin?
1496000	1498000	And obviously we're totally biased.
1498000	1501000	I'm sure all the people you met today were probably pretty blue.
1501000	1505000	Not that you had any way of knowing, but I just have that weird feeling.
1505000	1507000	You get a sense of our folks.
1507000	1508000	You're in favor of children reading.
1508000	1512000	It puts you on a decidedly left side of the...
1512000	1515000	It's already...
1515000	1518000	No child left behind.
1519000	1525000	I guess it's like you tally up all the little tiny little Texas municipalities.
1525000	1530000	It's like a big giant state and you get all these little tiny towns in it.
1530000	1535000	If you group them all together and also adjust for all the gerrymandering
1535000	1539000	and the districts and stuff, there's no way the state will ever be anything
1539000	1543000	other than a big giant red thing on the map.
1543000	1545000	But there's Austin. There's that.
1545000	1547000	There's Austin.
1547000	1549000	I feel like there should be a civic revolution.
1549000	1551000	We're having these elections are coming up now.
1551000	1554000	There's no way to vote for Obama.
1554000	1556000	There's people who are disillusioned with Obama.
1556000	1558000	There's people who are...
1558000	1563000	By and large, actually, I feel like this is a theme that happens every four years.
1563000	1569000	At the very beginning of things, everyone exercises, expresses their jadedness.
1569000	1571000	Everyone says, well, I'm not going to vote for change again.
1571000	1573000	We were promised change and nothing changed.
1573000	1576000	And I'm always like, yeah, go with that thought.
1576000	1579000	But then over the next year, what we're going to see is everybody get sucked
1579000	1584000	into this Coke versus Pepsi debate and...
1584000	1586000	I don't know, LaVar.
1588000	1591000	But the thing is, Dan, you do. You do know. You do know.
1591000	1594000	No, I don't, LaVar. I don't know.
1594000	1596000	Is that mood lighting?
1599000	1600000	We should move on.
1600000	1602000	I should talk about farts or poop or something.
1602000	1603000	That's what I'm really good at.
1603000	1606000	I got to get out of this political sand trap.
1606000	1607000	I just wanted to impress you.
1607000	1615000	You're very intimidating and gentle and smart and benevolent.
1615000	1620000	And we were upstairs with Aaron.
1620000	1627000	And we told LaVar that if he were to sign a copy of his children's book,
1627000	1629000	The Rhino That Swallowed the Storm,
1629000	1632000	we wouldn't open it until we had a child.
1632000	1637000	And if he wanted to, he could name our child by signing the book.
1637000	1641000	But he let it spill already.
1641000	1644000	Your first child would be named Kunta Harmon.
1648000	1651000	Which I'm fine with. It's kind of an appropriate...
1651000	1655000	Male or female, Kunta Harmon.
1663000	1665000	I'm trying to get out of there.
1665000	1666000	I'm looking at my notepad.
1666000	1670000	I want to get away from the political stuff because I'm just so bad at it.
1670000	1673000	It's not what makes me interesting.
1673000	1676000	I can talk about a shit I took and it's amazing.
1680000	1682000	Queen Elizabeth tweeted.
1693000	1695000	I just saw it on the news. Queen Elizabeth tweeted.
1695000	1698000	Apparently she did. She did. The queen tweeted.
1698000	1700000	The queen tweeted.
1702000	1705000	It just sounds funny. The queen tweeted.
1707000	1710000	But 60% of the coverage of it is dealing with the fact that
1710000	1714000	because they had a big iPad set up for her to tweet.
1714000	1718000	So she took off her royal glove and tweeted with her finger.
1718000	1721000	But immediately everyone was going,
1721000	1726000	well, your first tweet that you tweeted, it's not sent from an iPad.
1726000	1728000	It's sent from an iPhone.
1728000	1731000	They immediately were trolling her.
1731000	1735000	She's just got on Twitter and she's already having to deal with
1735000	1737000	everything that we have to deal with on Twitter.
1737000	1739000	Yeah.
1739000	1745000	I'm sure there was maybe a chance that they must have some aid
1745000	1748000	in the corner with an iPhone going, okay,
1748000	1751000	did she press the prop iPad?
1751000	1754000	Okay, now I'll send the tweet, the royal tweet.
1754000	1758000	And the royal tweet is like, oh, I'm the queen. I'm tweeting.
1758000	1762000	But I guess that iPad, and I kind of think, why is that?
1762000	1765000	Was there a chance that she might have typed into the iPad?
1765000	1767000	There was no chance.
1767000	1770000	I'm a parasite. Man should not be governed.
1770000	1772000	Run, run for the hills.
1773000	1777000	You have a right. You were born with all your rights.
1780000	1782000	All government is a lie.
1784000	1787000	They had to contain her, like maybe she does that sometimes.
1790000	1792000	The queen tweeted.
1792000	1795000	You heard it here first.
1795000	1798000	They had toothbrushes in my hotel room here in Austin.
1798000	1801000	It makes this, it already was the best city in the world.
1801000	1804000	The hotel room has toothbrushes and toothpaste in it.
1804000	1806000	You don't have to ask.
1806000	1808000	All right.
1808000	1810000	Go moving on.
1810000	1812000	It's awesome though.
1813000	1816000	United Airlines is terrible. It's a terrible airline.
1818000	1820000	And now you're just pandering.
1820000	1822000	You must travel a lot.
1822000	1824000	I do. I'm on the road all the time.
1824000	1827000	Do you always travel first class? It's okay to say that.
1827000	1828000	No.
1828000	1829000	You travel coach?
1829000	1834000	Tomorrow I'm on, not tomorrow on Sunday, I'm traveling JetBlue.
1834000	1838000	And that's like the gimmick of the whole airlines coach.
1838000	1841000	I travel Southwest all the time.
1841000	1844000	They're the ones that do the jokes and stuff.
1846000	1849000	But I do enjoy travel.
1849000	1852000	But you're okay with me always traveling first class.
1852000	1854000	I'm okay with it, yeah.
1854000	1857000	I figure, yeah.
1857000	1859000	You've earned it, Dan.
1859000	1861000	It doesn't make me elitist.
1861000	1864000	No, you've earned it. Now you're making me feel bad.
1864000	1866000	You teach children to read.
1866000	1869000	You should fly first class.
1870000	1872000	Why am I in first class?
1872000	1874000	You're Dan Harmon.
1874000	1876000	All right.
1876000	1878000	That means a lot in my book.
1878000	1880000	All right. Thank you.
1880000	1881000	No, it does.
1881000	1884000	Do you have the reading rainbow theme?
1885000	1887000	I'm asking Justin.
1887000	1888000	We can sing at acapella.
1888000	1890000	He's got it.
1890000	1892000	We can just sing it, can't we?
1892000	1894000	Austin, right?
1894000	1895000	All right, yeah.
1895000	1897000	I don't know how this is going to work, but let's just riff.
1897000	1901000	Reading rainbow.
1901000	1904000	Butterfly in the sky.
1904000	1906000	What?
1906000	1909000	Is this like a UK remix?
1909000	1911000	This is...
1912000	1915000	So, what that is...
1917000	1919000	Backstory.
1919000	1922000	Yeah, so, for Break or whatever her name is?
1922000	1926000	That is not Tina for Break, but here's the thing.
1927000	1932000	We did a remake of the reading rainbow theme song in the 90s,
1932000	1934000	in the early 90s.
1934000	1936000	No, actually it was the mid-90s.
1936000	1944000	And I went to my friend Shaka Khan and asked her to sing the reading rainbow theme song.
1944000	1949000	Not only did she sing it, she wrote the arrangement and plays drums on the track.
1949000	1953000	This is Shaka Khan singing the reading rainbow theme song.
1953000	1955000	So, you said, would you please do this?
1955000	1957000	Shaka Khan.
1957000	1958000	I would be happy.
1958000	1960000	Shaka Khan.
1960000	1961000	Shaka Khan.
1961000	1962000	Let me rock you.
1962000	1963000	Let me rock you, Shaka Khan.
1963000	1969000	She went away with it and then she came back Wednesday and sat down at Spago's for lunch with you
1969000	1971000	and she slid a tape across.
1971000	1975000	You put the Walkman in and you're listening to it and you're like, oh, shit.
1977000	1979000	She redid it.
1979000	1982000	And then you're like, good job, Shaka.
1987000	1989000	Shaka Khan, he's nodding.
1993000	1994000	You got it?
1996000	1997000	It's that hook.
1997000	1998000	We all know the hook.
1998000	1999000	Right?
1999000	2001000	The question is, how do I rap during it?
2001000	2003000	Because we're all going to want to sing it.
2003000	2004000	Right.
2004000	2006000	Maybe it's like, I don't know.
2010000	2011000	Yo.
2012000	2014000	Butterfly in the sky.
2014000	2015000	Yo.
2015000	2016000	Yo.
2016000	2017000	I can go twice as high.

2018000	2019000	Yo.
2019000	2020000	Take a look.
2020000	2021000	Yo.
2021000	2022000	It's in a book.
2022000	2023000	Yo.
2023000	2028000	I can go anywhere.
2028000	2029000	Anything.
2029000	2030000	Anywhere.
2030000	2032000	To know and ways to grow.
2032000	2033000	Yeah.
2033000	2034000	A reading rainbow.
2034000	2035000	Yo.
2035000	2036000	Yo.
2036000	2037000	Yo.
2037000	2038000	Butterfly caterpillar.
2038000	2039000	Oh, shit.
2039000	2040000	She's still singing.
2040000	2041000	Yeah.
2041000	2042000	Yo.
2042000	2043000	Yo.
2043000	2044000	It's in a book.
2044000	2045000	Yeah.

2050000	2051000	Yo.
2051000	2052000	Yo.
2052000	2053000	Yo.
2053000	2054000	Yo.
2054000	2055000	Yo.
2055000	2056000	Yo.
2056000	2057000	You're so pretty.
2057000	2058000	Yo.

2083000	2086000	Yo.
2086000	2088640	Yo.
2088640	2093560	Is there anybody, I can't imagine there's anyone in Austin that knows how to confidently
2093560	2094560	beat box.
2094560	2099640	I saw a hand go up there in the middle and your girlfriend's pointing at you or maybe
2099640	2101520	just your female friend.
2101520	2102560	I don't want to judge you.
2102560	2103560	It's Austin.
2103560	2104560	Yeah.
2104560	2105560	Come on.
2105560	2106560	You want to come up?
2106560	2107920	Do you think?
2107920	2113920	Do you think that you could, do you think it's possible for you to, to the tempo of
2113920	2114920	the reading rainbow?
2114920	2115920	No, come on.
2115920	2116920	Come on up.
2116920	2117920	We want to meet you.
2117920	2120880	Even, even if you don't, even if the answer is no, you're in a full Batman costume.
2120880	2121880	Come on up.
2121880	2122880	Yeah.
2122880	2125240	What's your name, young man?
2125240	2126240	Mars.
2126240	2127240	Mars.
2127240	2129360	Nothing about your disappoints.
2129360	2133360	Grab, grab a mic.
2133360	2140480	Mars is in a, a onesie, a Batman onesie, but the Batman logo says forum.
2140480	2142800	Is that a, is there something you're plugging?
2142800	2143800	No.
2143800	2144800	I found it at the thrift store.
2144800	2145800	Okay.
2145800	2149520	So there's some backstory to this that you don't even know about, but it fits you like
2149520	2150520	a glove.
2150520	2151520	I actually looked it up.
2151520	2153480	I think it's a defunct snowboarding company.
2153480	2154480	Oh, okay.
2154480	2157400	Well, it's, you're making it work.
2157400	2158400	Like I, what am I doing?
2158400	2163280	I'm just like Kevin Smith and it's a, it's not making, it's not going to help me.
2163280	2166480	In any way, uh, you, you look good.
2166480	2171940	The, the, do you think that you could listen to the reading rainbow theme and somehow maintain
2171940	2177800	the tempo so that when they finished singing the lyrics, then you're still beatboxing to
2177800	2186200	the tempo and then I can come in with my bad-ass science and then, okay, on top of that, LeVar.
2186200	2187200	Yeah.
2187200	2193000	After I'm like, I'm rapping and then I'll throw it to you for like a kind of LeVar Burton
2193200	2195000	spoken word bridge.
2195000	2196000	Nice.
2199400	2203880	And you can, you could talk about the importance of literacy or no child left behind, whatever
2203880	2205480	you want to talk about.
2205480	2209520	And then, and then, and then when you're done with that, I guess I'll try to like sew it
2209520	2214200	up with another verse of rapping and then we'll all just get out of here.
2214200	2218560	No, then we'll bring up our, our friends and we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll have all kinds
2218560	2219560	of fun.
2219560	2221480	Do you think you can do it Mars?
2221480	2222480	Sure.
2222480	2223480	It's going to be easy.
2223480	2225080	Let's give it a shot.
2225080	2227920	Because it's not like the beat is distinct in this thing.
2227920	2233080	It's like, oh, let's just try it.
2233080	2234080	Okay.
2239080	2240080	Should I do it?
2240080	2241080	Do it?
2241080	2242080	Oh yeah.
2242080	2243080	I'm not sure.
2243080	2244080	I'm not sure.
2244080	2245080	Butterfly in the sky.
2245080	2248080	I can go twice as high.
2248080	2250080	Take a look.
2250080	2252080	It's in a book.
2253080	2254080	You guys sing it.
2258080	2259080	Yeah.
2259080	2260080	Yeah.
2260080	2261080	Yeah.
2262080	2263080	Yeah.
2265080	2266080	Colors.
2270080	2272080	Red, yellow, orange, brown, green.
2274080	2275080	Yeah.
2276080	2277080	Yeah.
2277080	2278080	Yeah.
2280080	2281080	Yeah.
2282080	2287080	Yo, yo, yo, yo, pages and pages, books and books.
2287080	2290080	All the shelves are given all the looks.
2290080	2292080	I'm going to be literate.
2292080	2293080	Read every word.
2293080	2296080	Going to fuck your mama so hard she makes a turd.
2296080	2299080	I fucked your mama in the east and the west.
2299080	2302080	Fuck your mama so hard because I read the best.
2302080	2305080	When you read a book you get to fuck everyone's mom.
2305080	2309080	I fucked your mama like her name was Tom.
2309080	2311080	That means I made a man of her.
2311080	2314080	Yo, I fucked her like a Lannister.
2314080	2317080	I always pay all my debts.
2317080	2320080	I fucked your mama so hard she got wet.
2320080	2323080	But that sounded gross.
2323080	2324080	Yo.
2324080	2325080	Yo.
2327080	2329080	Spoken word.
2332080	2334080	Dan, I love you.
2335080	2337080	Dan, I love you.
2338080	2340080	Dan Harmon.
2341080	2343080	What is your mother's name?
2344080	2345080	Faye.
2345080	2346080	Yo.
2348080	2351080	Faye, Faye, Faye, Faye.
2352080	2355080	What do I say about your mama Faye?
2356080	2358080	Here's what I say.
2359080	2364080	She can come any day to my rainbow and read some rhymes
2364080	2370080	and we will have a lovely times and dancer son and what a gun.
2370080	2379080	He's a genius and he's won the lottery because he's the man.
2380080	2381080	Dan.
2381080	2382080	Yeah.
2382080	2383080	Yeah.
2383080	2384080	Yeah.
2384080	2385080	I can do anything.
2385080	2386080	Rainbow to rainbow.
2386080	2390080	Fuck your mama so hard there was a stain though.
2390080	2392080	And then I said sorry.
2392080	2395080	And then I got what the British call a lorry.
2395080	2396080	It's a bus.
2396080	2398080	A two-decker on top.
2398080	2399080	Fuck your mama so hard.
2399080	2400080	The government.
2400080	2401080	Brother mop.
2402080	2403080	Government.
2405080	2406080	Sorry.
2406080	2407080	Yo.
2407080	2408080	Yo.
2408080	2410080	I can do anything when I read.
2411080	2412080	Yo.
2412080	2414080	I made a necklace and a bead.
2414080	2416080	Put it all on the string around my neck.
2416080	2419080	I fucked your mama so hard that her name was...
2420080	2421080	He's back.
2421080	2422080	Back.
2422080	2423080	Back.
2423080	2424080	Back.
2424080	2425080	Back.
2425080	2426080	Back.
2426080	2427080	Back.
2427080	2429080	His parents are Scientologists and he respects the faith.
2429080	2432080	He shouldn't judge him for his legacy.
2434080	2438080	Here's some other people whose parents are Scientologists.
2440080	2441080	Science fiction guy.
2441080	2442080	What's his name?
2442080	2443080	L. Ron Hubbard.
2443080	2445080	Well, obviously...
2445080	2446080	No, not him.
2446080	2450080	That's the one science fiction writer whose parents are guaranteed not to be Scientologists.
2452080	2453080	Uh...
2454080	2457080	He's definitely getting back at them.
2458080	2460080	No, what's his name?
2461080	2462080	Everybody loves him.
2462080	2467080	He wrote that Doctor Who episode that beat my community episode for the...
2467080	2470080	Neil Gaiman's parents are Scientologists, yo.
2470080	2473080	And he's very respectful of them in the press.
2473080	2476080	Even though he's smart enough to know.
2476080	2478080	I think that's pretty cool.
2479080	2483080	Because, yo, religion doesn't have to be polarizing.
2489080	2491080	Take a look.
2491080	2492080	It's in a book.
2492080	2496080	I fucked your mama so hard, I turned a creek into a brook.
2496080	2498080	I turned a river into a lake.
2498080	2502080	I fucked your mama so hard, for goodness sake.
2502080	2505080	I fucked your mama from the ocean to the North Pole.
2505080	2507080	I fucked your mama like...
2507080	2509080	Fuck, God damn it.
2509080	2510080	I'm on a roll.
2510080	2512080	I gotta wrap this up.
2512080	2513080	Fuck, fuck.
2513080	2514080	All right.
2514080	2516080	Take a look.
2516080	2517080	It's in a book.
2517080	2519080	Fuck your mama...
2520080	2522080	In a breakfast nook.
2523080	2526080	LaVar Burton's in the house tonight.
2526080	2529080	I fucked your mama loose and tight.
2529080	2532080	I'm glad LaVar Burton's young daughter isn't here.
2533080	2534080	Me too, Dan.
2534080	2535080	Me too.
2535080	2536080	All right.
2536080	2537080	That's the wrap.
2537080	2538080	That's the wrap.
2538080	2539080	We did it.
2543080	2545080	I'm sure you're not an avid listener of the podcast,
2545080	2548080	but I tend to default to fucking mamas in my rapping.
2548080	2549080	Yeah.
2549080	2550080	That's all I know.
2550080	2551080	It's the go-to.
2551080	2552080	It's the go-to.
2552080	2556080	Mars, let's have a little chat with you.
2556080	2557080	Okay.
2557080	2558080	Thank you.
2558080	2559080	That was great beatboxing.
2559080	2560080	Sure.
2561080	2562080	What are you...
2562080	2564080	So are you Austin-ere?
2564080	2565080	What do they call them?
2565080	2566080	Austin-ite?
2566080	2567080	Austin-ite.
2568080	2569080	Yeah.
2569080	2570080	Are you native?
2570080	2572080	I'm originally from San Antonio.
2573080	2575080	I've been here three years.
2575080	2576080	Okay.
2576080	2577080	How old are you?
2577080	2578080	You seem young enough to ask.
2578080	2579080	I'm 26.
2579080	2580080	Okay.
2580080	2581080	Good.
2581080	2582080	What's your ambition?
2582080	2584080	Electronics and music.
2584080	2585080	Oh.
2585080	2589080	But you've clearly made electronics and music redundant.
2589080	2590080	Yeah.
2590080	2591080	Yeah.
2591080	2592080	All you need is your mouth.
2592080	2593080	Sure.
2593080	2595080	That's a fallback for you.
2595080	2596080	Yeah.
2596080	2597080	It's a contingency plan.
2597080	2599080	It's like a soldier being a doomsday prepper.
2599080	2603080	They're like, I love the government, but also one day it may fail.
2603080	2604080	It's their hobby.
2604080	2605080	Yeah.
2605080	2609080	Like what I've learned from Uncle Sam, I've learned to ration and store ammunition.
2609080	2610080	So that's your beatboxing.
2610080	2614080	It's like one day there may be no electronics or music.
2614080	2615080	Performance.
2615080	2620080	There's that Dick Van Dyke, the one man band in the Mrs. Poppins.
2620080	2623080	Mary Poppins.
2623080	2625080	My childhood is hazy.
2625080	2628080	Anyway, he's doing the one man band thing and it was very inspiring.
2628080	2635080	So the reason why your ambition is in electronics and music, do you want to produce music?
2635080	2638080	Do you want to make musical equipment?
2638080	2641080	Do you want to be around people that make music?
2641080	2642080	Is there anything?
2642080	2643080	You don't have to know.
2643080	2646080	You can beat 20 whatever you are.
2646080	2647080	Just feeling through it.
2647080	2648080	Yeah.
2648080	2649080	Okay.
2649080	2650080	Fuck it.
2650080	2651080	All right.
2651080	2652080	That's fine.
2652080	2653080	All right.
2653080	2655080	Do you love your mother?
2655080	2656080	Yeah.
2656080	2659080	She's great.
2659080	2661080	Do you think I'm required to love my mother?
2661080	2662080	No.
2662080	2664080	No, I think mothers and parents are difficult.
2664080	2665080	Yeah.
2665080	2667080	She's not coming to my wedding.
2667080	2669080	Faye is not coming to your wedding?
2669080	2670080	No.
2670080	2671080	What?
2671080	2677580	I think it's because my parents are tired of me making public hay out of them having
2677580	2680000	hit me when I was a kid.
2680000	2683600	So I feel like they're going, why would we want to go to a wedding where Jack Black's
2683600	2688800	going to be like, is that them?
2688800	2691120	And I kind of don't blame them for that reason.
2691120	2693080	I want to put this back together, Dan.
2693080	2695560	Do you think you could call my mom an apparent?
2695560	2699080	I would be happy to call Faye.
2700080	2707080	What time is it in Florida?
2707080	2709080	Early enough.
2709080	2710080	Early enough?
2710080	2711080	No.
2711080	2713080	If it's past six, she's asleep.
2713080	2714080	Yeah.
2714080	2715080	All right.
2715080	2716080	We'll work on it later.
2716080	2717080	Okay.
2717080	2718080	Yeah.
2718080	2721580	I think my mom would find a way to turn this into a horrible, uncomfortable thing.
2721580	2727280	It sounds like podcast dynamite calling my mom with a barber, but I think somehow it
2727280	2729400	could turn sour.
2729400	2731400	More fish for Kunta.
2731400	2734440	All right.
2734440	2737240	Let's thank Mars for coming up in beatboxing.
2737240	2740440	Oh, thank you, sir.
2740440	2741440	Thank you.
2741440	2749240	What a nice young man with a talented human beatbox.
2749240	2754960	I just need to point out that Mars has a back flap in his Batman suit.
2754960	2756960	Yeah.
2756960	2757960	Way to go, Mars.
2757960	2760640	It's a nice work.
2760640	2761840	Is it closed or open?
2761840	2769400	It was closed, but it has snaps for easy access.
2769400	2773920	Let's bring Spencer Crittenden, the dungeon master.
2773920	2783280	Oh, wait, I have one of these.
2783280	2784280	What up?
2785080	2788360	I'm going to sit down so that I'm not upstaging people.
2788360	2789880	You know, just a few things.
2789880	2792640	You know, we met Mars before on the Harmon tour.
2792640	2793640	He looks familiar.
2793640	2795640	He's even in the movie, right?
2795640	2796800	Yeah.
2796800	2797800	Great guy.
2797800	2798800	Great guy, Mars.
2798800	2800120	Also, Laurie is not a bus.
2800120	2802120	It's a truck.
2802120	2805120	Oh, brother.
2805120	2806960	You see the look you got from LaVar Burton?
2806960	2807960	I don't know.
2807960	2808960	No, I didn't know.
2808960	2809960	It was like this.
2809960	2810960	I'm sorry.
2810960	2813960	I speak English.
2814960	2818880	It's the same language.
2818880	2820880	What's up, you guys?
2820880	2823360	We're just giddy with delight.
2823360	2824360	I love you.
2824360	2826720	I'm sure a lot of people in Austin are excited for you to be here.
2826720	2828920	I'm excited for me.
2828920	2833120	By the way, podcast listeners might want to know they gave LaVar a standing ovation when
2833120	2834120	he came up.
2834120	2835120	I thought that was really nice.
2835120	2836120	Oh, yeah.
2836120	2843320	There were some other facts about LaVar Burton that kind of struck me.
2844320	2850320	Did you know that he did a little bit of unofficial work for the CIA?
2850320	2851320	No.
2851320	2852320	Yeah.
2852320	2856320	Well, I'm reading from Wikipedia.
2856320	2862320	Because his work for Reading Rainbow took him across several borders of hostile countries,
2862320	2868320	LaVar Burton was approached by the OSS, the wartime precursor to the CIA.
2868320	2869320	Oh, wait.
2869320	2870320	This is Houdini.
2870320	2871320	I'm sorry.
2871320	2872320	Yeah.
2872320	2875320	We get confused all the time.
2875320	2877320	You get confused with Houdini.
2877320	2880320	Kunta and Houdini.
2880320	2883320	Which is which.
2885320	2889320	So here's the thing, all right?
2889320	2894320	United Airlines, I already said, they're terrible people.
2894320	2897320	I tweeted that they're terrible.
2897320	2898320	They bumped us from the flight.
2898320	2899320	No.
2899320	2901320	We all know that airlines, they overbook.
2901320	2903320	Here's the thing about airlines.
2903320	2905320	Here's what they do.
2905320	2909320	They have X amount of seats on their plane, okay?
2909320	2910320	100 seats, let's say.
2910320	2912320	Let's keep it simple.
2912320	2915320	How many seats should you sell if you have 100 on your plane?
2915320	2916320	Why, 100.
2916320	2920320	Oh, funny, you should say.
2920320	2925320	Because what they do is they sell 115.
2925320	2928320	Because, and they'll be the first to tell you,
2928320	2932320	the reason we do that is because of no shows.
2932320	2935320	We have to do it because of no shows.
2935320	2939320	Oh, oh, oh, do some people not show up
2939320	2942320	for your business that you run?
2942320	2944320	Is that part of your overhead?
2944320	2946320	Here's the thing.
2946320	2948320	Those people get charged anyway.
2948320	2949320	We've all been no shows.
2949320	2951320	We all get charged.
2951320	2952320	You got 100 seats.
2952320	2954320	You sold 100 tickets.
2954320	2955320	Take your fucking money.
2955320	2960320	They overbook because they have a chance of making more money.
2960320	2961320	A chance.
2961320	2965320	They can't stand the idea of an empty seat on a plane
2965320	2968320	when they're like bringing the peanuts by.
2968320	2970320	They look at the seat and they're like,
2970320	2974320	oh, oh, oh, delicious money.
2974320	2976320	Oh, the pennies.
2976320	2979320	Oh, the nickels we could have had.
2979320	2983320	We could have sucked more blood from the poor.
2984320	2985320	They hate that.
2985320	2987320	That's what pains them.
2987320	2989320	What a wasted seat.
2989320	2991320	It's not because they're victims.
2991320	2993320	It's not like airline piracy
2993320	2995320	when someone doesn't show up for a flight.
2995320	2998320	So fuck you, every airline in the world,
2998320	3003320	and also it's not fair because your companies are like pseudo companies
3003320	3006320	because they're not accountable to the normal laws
3006320	3008320	of supply and demand or capitalism.
3008320	3010320	They're protected from bankruptcy.
3010320	3012320	They're protected from competition.
3012320	3014320	They have virtual monopolies.
3014320	3017320	They're playing in a weird sandbox of fake capitalism
3017320	3019320	overseen by the government.
3019320	3021320	They're all bullshit companies.
3021320	3024320	And I reserve the right to get mad when I show up at the gate
3024320	3027320	and somebody goes, oh, ladies and gentlemen,
3027320	3029320	we've got a serious situation here.
3029320	3031320	I don't know how this happened,
3031320	3035320	but it seems like there's more people than seats.
3035320	3039320	So at this point in time, we'd like to invite you to come up
3039320	3043320	and if you want to come up and help us out a little bit,
3043320	3046320	you're kind of fucking us over by being people.
3046320	3050320	It's not like we signed up for this.
3050320	3052320	Just hold tight.
3052320	3053320	And then you go up and you're like,
3053320	3054320	what the fuck are you talking about?
3054320	3056320	We've got to do a show in Austin.
3056320	3058320	Excuse me.
3058320	3060320	That's it.
3060320	3061320	You say, LaVar Burton, you fly coach.
3061320	3063320	You never have a problem with anybody.
3063320	3064320	You're a better person than me.
3064320	3066320	Fine.
3067320	3069320	I want to get LaVar Burton mad about something.
3069320	3070320	What makes you mad?
3070320	3071320	No child left behind.
3071320	3073320	Fucking let us have it.
3073320	3076320	Both barrels.
3076320	3077320	Really?
3077320	3078320	Get mad.
3078320	3080320	I want to hear LaVar Burton rant.
3080320	3081320	What makes you fucking mad?
3081320	3085320	What makes your wife go, LaVar, calm down?
3085320	3089320	What makes you kind of hit the mirror on the dresser?
3089320	3092320	At the foot of the bed, you're taking off your beautiful jewelry
3092320	3100320	at the end of a long day of teaching children to read.
3100320	3102320	And you're like, and another fucking thing.
3102320	3105320	LaVar, you're scaring me.
3105320	3106320	Yeah?
3106320	3108320	You haven't seen the half of it.
3108320	3110320	I can do anything.
3114320	3117320	Take a look, motherfucker.
3117320	3118320	I'm a book.
3118320	3119320	What is it?
3119320	3126320	What's the thing that gets your goddamn, really, your bright red goat going?
3130320	3133320	I am not really fond of ignorant people.
3133320	3135320	Yeah.
3135320	3137320	I get offended by ignorant people.
3137320	3141320	Like, you know, like people get offended when people, you know, say like,
3141320	3145320	hey, asshole, you know, I get offended just when someone's ignorant.
3146320	3150320	I'm like, where do you get off not knowing where the stop sign is?
3150320	3152320	That's something most of the time.
3152320	3156320	Well, what kind of, give us an ignorant person that really...
3156320	3162320	Well, people who are intolerant of other people.
3162320	3164320	Keep going.
3164320	3168320	We've got to get the intolerance out of you.
3168320	3172320	I know it'll seem hypocritical, but I want you to,
3173320	3175320	I want you to be so angry at me.
3175320	3176320	You want me to be angry, Dan?
3176320	3177320	Yeah.
3177320	3178320	You want me to be angry?
3178320	3180320	Just for funsies.
3183320	3185320	Motherfucker, I will cut you.
3187320	3189320	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3189320	3191320	No, shut the fuck up.
3192320	3195320	I will cut you.
3195320	3196320	Me?
3196320	3197320	Bitch.
3197320	3198320	What?
3198320	3200320	Because of my ignorance?
3200320	3204320	No, no, not because of your ignorance.
3204320	3207320	Because you want me to be fucking angry.
3208320	3211320	Dan Harmon, you have pushed me over the edge.
3218320	3221320	You're the gentlest man in the world.
3221320	3222320	I disagree.
3222320	3227320	That's the kind of quiet intensity that absolutely makes me shit myself.
3227320	3229320	No, I'm not saying it's not scary.
3229320	3232320	Nobody in this room wants to disappoint LeVar Burton.
3232320	3236320	I'm not saying like, oh, you're such a sugar cube.
3236320	3239320	I'm saying like, this guy is so in control.
3239320	3242320	You don't have the caloric valve.
3242320	3245320	What's that Confederacy of Dunst's guys?
3245320	3249320	You don't have the fucking stack to blow.
3249320	3252320	You don't lose control of your anger.
3252320	3254320	You sit on it.
3254320	3255320	Not sit on it.
3255320	3256320	You're not repressed.
3256320	3258320	You're noble.
3258320	3260320	You're a noble creature.
3260320	3264320	You're a noble, highly evolved old soul.
3266320	3269320	Does it make you mad when I define you like that?
3270320	3273320	You fucking noble soul.
3274320	3276320	Come on.
3276320	3279320	I hate you, Dan Harmon.
3279320	3280320	I hate you.
3280320	3282320	Your hate's bullshit.
3282320	3285320	Yeah, I'm sorry. It is. You're right.
3287320	3289320	It's good.
3289320	3294320	That's a result that's actually more valuable than just getting you to like.
3294320	3296320	Yeah, like we got to confirm.
3296320	3304320	LeVar Burton's biosphere doesn't have the T-Rex in your on your planet
3304320	3311320	has like, he's holding little flowers in his little hands,
3311320	3313320	his little T-Rex hands.
3314320	3316320	How does he pick him?
3317320	3320320	That was a bad analogy. It doesn't make any sense.
3320320	3321320	I think it was good.
3321320	3322320	It was visual.
3322320	3324320	Yeah, it was a visual analogy.
3324320	3326320	I know what'll make you mad if nothing else.
3326320	3327320	Talk to me.
3327320	3332320	Let's get, because I know a secret also on LeVar Burton's Wikipedia.
3332320	3334320	He's a rampant misogynist.
3335320	3336320	He hates women.
3336320	3339320	So let's bring up my fiance, Erin McGathey.
3343320	3351320	Take notes, Dan.
3355320	3363320	LeVar kind of, he's outclassed me, brought her up like a gentleman.
3364320	3370320	Yeah, we were at dinner, and Dan and Neil Berkley, the director of the documentary,
3370320	3374320	both had flowers in their drink, and Neil very valiantly gave me his flower,
3374320	3377320	and I looked at Dan and he had his and his hair.
3380320	3381320	Yeah.
3381320	3383320	I don't, yeah.
3383320	3386320	But we're going to couples therapy and we're learning.
3386320	3390320	I'm learning how to perceive people.
3390320	3393320	Erin, have you met Fay?
3393320	3394320	I have met Fay.
3394320	3395320	And?
3395320	3402320	Yeah, I met Dan's parents only two months into dating him because they were visiting,
3402320	3406320	and Dan was very nervous about hosting for them, so I hosted like a game night,
3406320	3412320	and it was very early on, so they were fine and sweet.
3412320	3413320	They're good with you?
3413320	3414320	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3414320	3415320	No, they were great.
3415320	3419320	They were, they, his dad got a little drunk, and at one point Dan said,
3419320	3421320	we were playing, what were you playing?
3421320	3422320	Catchphrase, the only game we played.
3422320	3424320	I'm so nervous being on stage with you.
3424320	3425320	I'm really excited.
3426320	3429320	The butterflies in my stomach are flying twice as high.
3431320	3434320	But they're in your stomach, so they're just in your esophagus?
3434320	3436320	Yeah, they're stuck right here.
3436320	3439320	Their stomach butterfly is flying twice as high.
3439320	3441320	They're just going to puke them up.
3442320	3445320	Yeah, it's going to be gross and beautiful later.
3445320	3446320	At the same time.
3446320	3448320	Yeah, it's going to be a Banksy on the stage.
3449320	3453320	Yeah, at one point Dan said something kind of off-color,
3453320	3456320	and his dad, Hermes, like very earnestly said to him,
3456320	3459320	like, come on, stop it, or she won't marry you.
3460320	3461320	Something like that.
3461320	3462320	Something along those lines.
3462320	3463320	Do you remember that?
3463320	3464320	I don't remember that.
3464320	3465320	I logged it away.
3465320	3466320	I liked it.
3467320	3469320	But yeah, they're super, super nice.
3469320	3470320	They're good folk.
3470320	3476320	It breaks my heart that I've somehow, like, I just, I don't know.
3476320	3478320	As I have named your first child,
3478320	3482320	might I get an invitation to the nuptials?
3482320	3484320	Are you fucking kidding me?
3485320	3486320	It's a pretty full wedding.
3486320	3487320	I don't know.
3487320	3490320	Can we fire our officiant when you marry us?
3492320	3493320	You know what?
3493320	3498320	I have been asked before, and if you're serious, I accept.
3498320	3509320	How about this, would you be willing to, because our friend Duncan
3509320	3511320	is going to officiate our wedding.
3511320	3513320	I don't want to diss Duncan.
3513320	3517320	But would you please do a reading at our ceremony?
3517320	3518320	Yes.
3518320	3519320	Absolutely.
3519320	3520320	All right.
3520320	3522320	Absolutely.
3522320	3525320	You could read Bread is for Eating.
3525320	3527320	Bread is for Eating.
3527320	3530320	If that's what you like, yeah.
3530320	3532320	What about Frederick?
3532320	3535320	Do you remember, do you have, like, an encyclopedic knowledge of children's books?
3535320	3537320	Do you remember Leo Leone?
3537320	3538320	Leo Leone.
3538320	3539320	Yeah, okay.
3539320	3540320	It doesn't ring a bell.
3540320	3541320	You're a fraud.
3541320	3542320	Yeah.
3544320	3549320	I always thought those kids' book reviews, they're too concise.
3550320	3552320	Reader-gate.
3553320	3555320	I feel like those kids are, like, they're, like, six.
3555320	3561320	Why are they, like, I read the meatball in the Earth sky.
3562320	3563320	It's a great book.
3563320	3565320	I'm, like, this kid doesn't talk like a kid.
3565320	3566320	The fix is in.
3566320	3568320	This is Paola.
3568320	3573320	Levar, as the host of Reading Rainbow and as an author yourself,
3573320	3576320	are there any children's books that are really popular that you're, like,
3576320	3577320	come on, this is bullshit.
3577320	3578320	Oh, no, no, no.
3578320	3581320	I am a big fan of Go the Fuck to Sleep.
3582320	3586320	I remember that being in the press, people being offended by it,
3586320	3590320	but then other, it seems like, I don't want to, I mean,
3590320	3593320	I'm sure there were real parents that were offended as well,
3593320	3598320	but it kind of felt like most real parents were big fans of that book,
3598320	3601320	and people who weren't yet parents were like, this is offensive.
3601320	3605320	It's like, no, like, come on, go the fuck to sleep.
3606320	3610320	No, if you're a real parent, if you are a parent, you can relate to that book.
3611320	3614320	Go the fuck to sleep.
3615320	3618320	I have a wedding ceremony pitch.
3618320	3625320	Seeing as you're, it's traditional at the reception for the father of the groom
3625320	3628320	to give a speech, and your lovely father won't be there.
3628320	3629320	Oh, my parents are coming.
3629320	3631320	Will you play my dad at my wedding?
3633320	3634320	Is that what you were going to suggest?
3634320	3635320	Yeah, yeah.
3637320	3639320	I'm going to cry.
3640320	3642320	Laverne is so unfazed by this.
3642320	3645320	This is the 20th time someone's asked him to play.
3646320	3649320	However, this is the first time I've said yes.
3652320	3653320	All right.
3653320	3658320	Laverne Burton is going to play the role of my father at my wedding.
3658320	3662320	Now we have to get, like, Catherine Keener to be my mom or something.
3665320	3666320	What?
3667320	3668320	She just seems very cold.
3668320	3669320	I don't know.
3672320	3673320	We can do better, Dan.
3673320	3674320	We can do better.
3675320	3676320	She's a great actor.
3676320	3677320	I love her.
3677320	3680320	But you need more of a, what about a...
3682320	3683320	Chaka Khan.
3684320	3685320	Chaka Khan.
3686320	3687320	Chaka Khan.
3687320	3688320	Chaka Khan.
3688320	3689320	I'll let Laverne make that call.
3689320	3690320	Thank you.
3691320	3693320	Hey, remember when you fucked up my song?
3693320	3700320	Now it's time to make it right.
3702320	3703320	You're going to come play.
3704320	3705320	Don't ask.
3705320	3707320	I'm going to explain the role to you.
3707320	3709320	You can't ask any questions.
3711320	3712320	She's just there.
3713320	3714320	What am I doing?
3715320	3716320	Oh, God.
3716320	3719320	I'm already in mourning over my relationship with Chaka.
3720320	3721320	I don't think she listens.
3722320	3723320	Oh, really?
3724320	3730320	I remember my brother listening to that song on a loop from 1982 to 1986.
3731320	3732320	Chaka Khan.
3732320	3733320	Let me rock you.
3733320	3734320	Let me rock you, Chaka Khan.
3734320	3736320	That was just over and over and over again.
3736320	3739320	I was so shocked to find out that Chaka Khan was her name.
3739320	3741320	I thought it was like, get down.
3741320	3742320	Chaka Khan.
3743320	3744320	Rock and roll.
3744320	3745320	Chaka Khan.
3745320	3747320	You thought it was just a thing people say?
3747320	3750320	Yeah, I was corrected because I said it at school.
3750320	3754320	I got an equation right in math class and was like, Chaka Khan.
3755320	3756320	That's not a bad idea.
3756320	3758320	You know that's her name, right?
3758320	3759320	No, I thought...
3759320	3760320	You thought it was like, kablamo.
3760320	3761320	Yeah.
3762320	3763320	Booyah.
3764320	3765320	Booyah Johnson.
3768320	3771320	Speaking of, I cannot wait to have little Kunta Harmon.
3772320	3773320	You can't wait to...
3774320	3781320	Are you doing what I'm doing right now, which is trying to figure out a joke where someone
3781320	3787320	gets Kunta's name wrong and kindergarten and she has to correct her teacher over and over again?
3788320	3789320	No, I hadn't thought about that.
3791320	3793320	Actually, I mean, Aaron's 12 years younger than me.
3793320	3801320	Being raised in the 70s, the truth is, because we were at that weird event horizon of racial
3801320	3806320	politics, the name Kunta Kinte, the words...
3806320	3811320	When you do that joke, LaVar Adlibbed that at the end of the community episode when he
3811320	3812320	goes, more fish for Kunta.
3814320	3815320	Every time...
3815320	3820320	The word Kunta makes my spinal cord kind of cringe a little bit.
3820320	3823320	Yeah, there's a definite visual that goes on with that.
3823320	3828320	Well, it was used so much back then in negative ways.
3828320	3832320	Because it was a positive thing, it was like...
3832320	3843320	I grew up in Milwaukee in the 70s, so if you have a Camaro and a mullet and the words Kunta
3843320	3849320	Kinte were not used primarily, what a great character.
3850320	3855320	I hear the words and they have a shock to my system.
3855320	3858320	I'm like, he said it, not me.
3859320	3860320	I don't know.
3860320	3867320	Which is why my experience on community was one of the best of my professional career.
3867320	3870320	You let the Adlib go.
3871320	3874320	You let it stay in the picture, Dan.
3875320	3878320	You left it in the episode.
3878320	3879320	But that's more on you, right?
3879320	3881320	That you was that good.
3881320	3884320	Yeah, I'll cut it if it's not funny.
3884320	3887320	I'll cut it if it is funny and we don't have time.
3887320	3892320	We tortured you when you came back for the horrible heart-wrenching Troy Goodbye episode.
3892320	3895320	Thank you so much for coming back and doing that.
3895320	3900320	We shot the tag where you were sitting in that boat with Donald.
3900320	3902320	There's basically two versions of that tag.
3902320	3906320	There's the one that you've seen where Donald pulls out the piece of paper
3906320	3909320	and he has a thousand questions about Star Trek.
3909320	3913320	But then there's a whole different one which has blocking and everything.
3913320	3917320	Where LaVar Burton just turns out to have a lot of road rage.
3919320	3923320	He's just there with Donald and he's in trafficking.
3923320	3925320	He's like, I don't know what to take it so long.
3925320	3930320	And then somebody honks and he goes up to the window and the whole tag is just LaVar Burton yelling at some unseen lady.
3930320	3932320	Going like, hey, what do you think you're doing?
3932320	3935320	Don't look at your baby. Your baby's on my side.
3939320	3942320	It's really funny, but we didn't have time for that version.
3942320	3945320	I really want LaVar to officiate our wedding.
3945320	3947320	No, Duncan Trussell is going to do a great job.
3947320	3949320	I know. I love him.
3949320	3951320	Duncan will officiate.
3951320	3954320	I will do a reading.
3954320	3955320	Yes, thank you.
3955320	3956320	It's going to be great.
3956320	3958320	I will do a reading.
3958320	3963320	After Duncan says, I now pronounce you man and wife, can you also just say it?
3965320	3968320	I also pronounce you.
3969320	3974320	I now pronounce you man and wife and then we'll all look over at LaVar and LaVar will nod.
3977320	3980320	It'll be like a Mr. Miyagi kind of like.
3981320	3983320	Y'all are married now.
3984320	3985320	For real.
3986320	3988320	My poor father is getting.
3988320	3994320	My father is a preacher and I think wanted to be involved in the wedding and he's getting further and further away.
3995320	3998320	By the way, you're raised Catholic.
3998320	3999320	You went to seminary school.
3999320	4001320	How much of that did have to do with your parents?
4001320	4002320	How religious were your parents?
4002320	4004320	My mother was not Catholic at all.
4004320	4005320	My mother was a teacher.
4005320	4006320	She was an educator.
4006320	4010320	She knew that the best education available for her three children.
4010320	4018320	My mother's a single parent and I was raised Catholic because that was where the education was.
4018320	4020320	Education was the leveler of the playing field.
4020320	4027320	She knew that if I was going to that I would grow up and inherit a world that would be hostile to my presence simply because of the color of my skin.
4027320	4036320	And the only chance I had was to be able to compete on leveling and an education was the key to that.
4037320	4038320	Smart lady.
4039320	4040320	What a mom.
4040320	4042320	How did you feel about you going to seminary?
4043320	4046320	When I decided to become a priest, my mother was very nervous.
4046320	4048320	She was like, oh, I've gone too far.
4051320	4052320	But she supported me.
4052320	4060320	And then when I decided not to become a priest and become an actor, she was also very nervous for me.
4060320	4061320	But it's all worked out.
4061320	4062320	So Irma Jean's good.
4063320	4064320	She's good.
4064320	4065320	Her name's Irma Jean?
4065320	4068320	Irma Jean, E-R-M-A-G-E-N-E.
4068320	4072320	Whenever I get an opportunity to speak my mother's name in front of people, I do.
4072320	4078320	I say that I am the man I am because she is the woman she is.
4078320	4079320	Is she still out there?
4079320	4080320	Absolutely.
4082320	4087320	Did she tell you you can do anything you want?
4087320	4088320	Absolutely.
4088320	4091320	My mom, by the way, also did that.
4091320	4095320	That's why I want to have a conversation with her.
4096320	4099320	She always said you can do whatever you want.
4100320	4102320	She also hit us a little bit.
4102320	4104320	It's not a big deal.
4104320	4106320	I just fall back on that.
4106320	4108320	I got beat when I was a kid.
4108320	4109320	We all did.
4109320	4110320	Yeah.
4110320	4112320	It was the way parenting was conducted back in the day.
4112320	4113320	That's what my mom said.
4113320	4114320	Hello.
4114320	4115320	Yeah.
4115320	4116320	You turned out okay.
4116320	4117320	I'm fine.
4117320	4118320	Right?
4118320	4119320	I'm a millionaire.
4119320	4120320	Hello.
4120320	4121320	Yeah.
4121320	4122320	I don't remember how much it hurt.
4122320	4125320	I do know how much money I have.
4127320	4128320	Now you tell me.
4128320	4132320	I feel like if my parents were like, you know, I feel like, you know.
4132320	4136320	And you would never strike Kunta Harmon.
4136320	4137320	No.
4137320	4138320	No, I wouldn't.
4138320	4139320	I wouldn't.
4139320	4140320	No, you won't.
4140320	4143320	I once, I kind of, I chased my cat once.
4143320	4145320	And I got really upset.
4145320	4146320	I was living alone.
4146320	4147320	I wasn't in a relationship.
4147320	4149320	And my cat kept meowing.
4149320	4151320	And I got really frustrated.
4151320	4153320	And I kind of chased her.
4153320	4155320	And I was like screaming and like chasing.
4155320	4157320	And then I was like, oh, fuck.
4157320	4159320	I'm going to beat my kids.
4159320	4165320	But I think that our parents hit us a hundred times less than their parents hit them.
4165320	4166320	Exactly right.
4166320	4171320	And I think we've got it down now to like maybe we'll, maybe I'll give my kid a wet
4171320	4172320	willy.
4172320	4177320	I mean, I don't want you to chase and frighten our kids around the house.
4177320	4180320	But I would like to see what that would look like.
4180320	4188320	I've always figured that I would just like a one time dispensation just so they know
4188320	4192320	I'm crazy enough to do it again.
4192320	4194320	I think that goes a long way.
4194320	4198320	I think that parents like, yeah, my heart goes out to parents today.
4198320	4203320	Like when you see them at the airport and they're like, this generation is committed
4203320	4209320	to the idea that there's never a good reason to hit your kid.
4209320	4213320	And I can see that it's not easy.
4213320	4217320	I can see from the expression on their face in the grocery store, I can see that they
4217320	4220320	are, it's not like they're pussies.
4221320	4227320	It's not like they're not doing it because they don't want to.
4227320	4230320	I can see that it's actually discipline.
4230320	4234320	On the part of a generation that probably did get walloped a little bit and they're
4234320	4236320	like, yeah, let's experiment.
4236320	4239320	I do also see a lot of parents that are like, I'm going to be my kid's best friend
4239320	4242320	and the kid is like a fucking horrible nightmare.
4242320	4249320	But I don't judge because I'm not a judgmental person at all.
4250320	4256320	But I think we're conducting a generation wide experiment right now that seems to be
4256320	4257320	successful.
4257320	4259320	I think that time outs and all that shit do work.
4259320	4261320	I think that the kids are going to be fine.
4261320	4265320	I don't think you need to hit your kid, right?
4265320	4267320	That's not a controversial statement.
4267320	4270320	Dan, I'll cover the parenting.
4270320	4271320	I'll take care of it.
4271320	4273320	Oh, yeah.
4273320	4278320	I'll just wake my kid up at 3 in the morning and be like, hey, the Holocaust happened.
4279320	4283320	Six million Jews.
4283320	4285320	It's horrible.
4285320	4289320	Good night.
4289320	4292320	My favorite children's book was Frederick by Leo Leone.
4292320	4297320	Just put that in the hopper for the wedding if he really does show up and really reads
4297320	4298320	a book.
4298320	4302320	I don't want your favorite book necessarily to be the only one in the run.
4302320	4304320	We just give him a pile of books.
4304320	4306320	Well, someone should make a choice.
4306320	4311320	Maybe it should be based on the number of awards that the author received.
4311320	4318320	I believe Leo Leone is highly acclaimed and recently deceased.
4318320	4320320	An Italian.
4320320	4324320	I don't know what this shit you're raised on is.
4324320	4327320	It's probably some watercolor bullshit.
4327320	4330320	It's by an AIDS activist with leukemia.
4330320	4331320	Who cares?
4331320	4332320	It's fine.
4332320	4333320	It's fine.
4333320	4335320	It doesn't matter.
4336320	4337320	They're dying.
4337320	4338320	It doesn't matter.
4338320	4345320	If we were to play D&D, we got our dungeon master, we got me, we got you, we got Lavar.
4345320	4348320	Do we need an extra person to play another part?
4348320	4349320	I can't remember.
4349320	4350320	I can't keep track.
4350320	4351320	We do.
4351320	4352320	We should make a friend.
4352320	4356320	Last night in Austin, it hasn't aired yet, but Austin.
4356320	4357320	We're in Austin.
4357320	4358320	San Francisco.
4358320	4359320	Jackass.
4360320	4366320	Last night in San Francisco, we had two dudes up, so I want to balance it with someone who
4366320	4369320	at the very least identifies as a female.
4369320	4372320	New progressive Harmon.
4374320	4378320	And I think we should base it on somebody that let's go with the pain this time.
4378320	4383320	Who's had a terrible day or a terrible month or a terrible, okay, we got a hand shot up.
4383320	4388320	Do you want to come up and will you share your misery with us?
4388320	4389320	Okay.
4389320	4392320	It's all right if it hits a nice medium.
4399320	4400320	All right.
4400320	4401320	You take this.
4401320	4402320	What's your name?
4402320	4403320	Vanessa.
4403320	4404320	Vanessa.
4404320	4405320	Okay.
4405320	4406320	Vanessa.
4406320	4409320	What's the medium problem?
4409320	4412320	Well, I just had a really bad week.
4412320	4413320	I started on Monday.
4413320	4418320	I had to work for this commercial as a PA.
4418320	4421320	I'm not going to say the name whatsoever.
4421320	4428320	But for this LA woman, and yeah, it was like in the beginning, it was great, but I hired
4428320	4430320	my best friend as my co-PA.
4430320	4432320	He's my co-director.
4432320	4434320	We make small music videos.
4434320	4441320	It was really fun, but he's like a total stoner kind of, and we smoked the first day on Monday.
4441320	4443320	And I think she kind of knew.
4443320	4446320	And I felt really bad because here in Austin, it's relaxed.
4446320	4447320	Everything's chill.
4447320	4448320	It's okay.
4448320	4449320	We can do everything.
4449320	4450320	We did everything she told us to do.
4450320	4452320	But I think she knew that we were high the first time.
4452320	4453320	So we were like, oh, okay, whatever.
4453320	4454320	It's fine.
4454320	4455320	And she called us kids.
4455320	4456320	And she was playing teacher kind of.
4456320	4459320	And she had this thing where she's like, you didn't bring a notebook.
4459320	4461320	You couldn't hear this paper.
4461320	4462320	You're wasting trees.
4462320	4466320	And then she throws away all the food that we want to buy her.
4466320	4471320	She's like, all right, this lady is obviously not green, but whatever, from LA.
4471320	4474320	And then on Tuesday, we show up again.
4474320	4475320	And we were kind of late.
4475320	4478320	We woke up that day like, oh, well, we had to get a smoothie.
4478320	4480320	And we showed up.
4480320	4482320	Are you all so stoned for that?
4482320	4483320	Okay, sorry.
4483320	4484320	We're total stoners.
4484320	4486320	So we get high again.
4486320	4490320	Have you ever heard of Molin?
4490320	4491320	Molin?
4491320	4492320	Molin?
4492320	4493320	No.
4493320	4495320	Can I reach across and I'm going to grab my drink?
4495320	4497320	Let's just say it's an herb for your lungs.
4497320	4499320	And lately, I just quit cigarettes like two weeks ago.
4499320	4503320	And I've been trying to clear my lungs, smoking Molin spliffs.
4503320	4504320	And they're so good.
4504320	4505320	So we like-
4505320	4508320	But you're smoking something to clean your lungs out?
4508320	4509320	Yeah, yeah.
4509320	4511320	No, I didn't believe it too, but I looked it up.
4511320	4513320	And it's like this ancient cowboy thing.
4513320	4514320	Anyways.
4514320	4515320	Ancient cowboys.
4515320	4518320	Like before science came around.
4518320	4519320	So.
4519320	4520320	Ancient cowboys.
4520320	4521320	No, no, totally.
4521320	4524320	But anyways, so then we get high again.
4524320	4530320	And she's like making us the whole task for the commercial was like we had to sort positive
4530320	4532320	phrases and negative phrases.
4532320	4535320	And like people basically had to choose like three things they wanted to do.
4535320	4536320	A future and past.
4536320	4538320	And like I got to say like I graduated college.
4538320	4540320	That's a positive thing, you know?
4540320	4541320	And they were like my mother died.
4541320	4542320	That's a negative thing.
4542320	4544320	And the positive things were yellow.
4544320	4547320	And then the blue things or the negative things were blue.
4547320	4548320	This was a job?
4548320	4549320	This was a PA, yeah.
4549320	4550320	This was a PA, yeah.
4550320	4553320	You sure your parents didn't drop you off at like a rehab center?
4553320	4556320	I didn't convince you it was a music video.
4556320	4557320	No, go in there.
4557320	4559320	Winona Ryder's in there.
4559320	4561320	She can't wait to meet you.
4561320	4564320	We're getting paid $225.
4564320	4565320	I need the cash.
4565320	4566320	I'm like super broke.
4566320	4567320	So I'm doing it.
4567320	4569320	And then anyways we're like kind of high.
4569320	4571320	So it's kind of funny to read some of these things.
4571320	4575320	Because everybody wrote like I mean so one of the negative phrases like was like Ebola.
4575320	4576320	And we're like reading this out loud.
4576320	4577320	We're like oh man.
4577320	4578320	Some of them are so negative.
4578320	4580320	Everybody wanted a car for the future things.
4580320	4583320	And like it was kind of sad about the positive phrases were really sad because they were
4583320	4584320	all generic.
4584320	4587320	Like there were two or three where I'm like damn I really like this person.
4587320	4589320	Like one person said I want to write a book.
4589320	4592320	And like for the first like someone finally wants to write a book.
4592320	4593320	Like everybody wants a house or a car.
4593320	4596320	Like they want to be an actor because they're all extras.
4596320	4599320	You know like the extras were the ones that were all these things.
4599320	4601320	So anyways we're reading them out loud.
4601320	4602320	And she's like you have no time.
4602320	4603320	You have no time.
4603320	4605320	Just put them in like you know in the bins.
4605320	4606320	And we're like oh my god but these are great.
4606320	4608320	You're getting to know all these people you know.
4608320	4610320	And she's like we're on a schedule.
4610320	4612320	We're the only ones who are really doing the work.
4612320	4616320	Like the other L.A. girls were by the way like the most mean girls ever.
4616320	4622320	Like when Federico my friend went on lunch break to get all the food.
4622320	4624320	I was eating like my sandwich by myself.
4624320	4626320	And I know I'm a really weird girl.
4626320	4627320	But I was like eating a sandwich.
4627320	4632320	I don't think anyone thought that you were anything out of the ordinary.
4632320	4636320	And then they were like they look at me and they're like you know you can sit with us
4636320	4637320	if you want to.
4637320	4639320	And I was like okay sure I sat with them.
4639320	4641320	And I'm like eating my sandwich.
4641320	4642320	But they're still they were like kind of like rude.
4642320	4645320	And they kicked my best friend off like I said P.A. too.
4645320	4646320	So I was like damn it.
4646320	4647320	Like Liz can't be here either.
4647320	4649320	So I'm just with Federico my friend Eric.
4649320	4650320	And I relate to them more.
4650320	4652320	So anyways the day goes on.
4652320	4657320	And like we save them because we find these negative words in the yellow pile.
4657320	4660320	We're like dude there are some negative words in the yellow pile.
4660320	4662320	And you're putting them in the negative pile.
4662320	4663320	And they're like no no no no.
4663320	4664320	Just go with it.
4664320	4665320	Just go with it.
4665320	4668320	And they're like no but some of the yellow words are actually negative.
4668320	4669320	Like that's really bad.
4669320	4672320	And this like woman's like no we're all doing it.
4672320	4674320	What is this production?
4674320	4676320	I can't say what it's for.
4676320	4678320	You're a P.A. and they're doing it.
4678320	4680320	But anyways so as we save them.
4680320	4681320	No.
4681320	4682320	Sorry.
4682320	4683320	No it's fine.
4683320	4685320	As we save them we're like saving them.
4685320	4690320	She calls me out and she's like you know what we're not going to need you on Wednesday.
4690320	4692320	Like I don't trust you guys.
4692320	4694320	And you guys are just I can't vibe with you guys.
4694320	4696320	Like I already hired 10 P.A.s.
4696320	4702320	And I was like well because I had my part of my task was to hire 10 P.A.s for their actual shoot.
4702320	4706320	And these women like they were women who like put their children in daycare for Wednesday.
4706320	4708320	And then I was like wait a minute you're not letting me down.
4708320	4712320	You're like letting down like 10 people that I got to say like now they can't show up for this commercial.
4712320	4714320	And she's like well it's okay.
4714320	4717320	And then I find out today I'm not even going to get paid.
4717320	4719320	I don't know if I'm going to get paid for it.
4719320	4721320	No I'm not going to do that.
4721320	4723320	Don't heckle people.
4723320	4725320	Oh yeah and anyways so it was a bad day.
4725320	4726320	I'm not getting paid.
4726320	4727320	I don't know if I'm getting paid.
4727320	4729320	I don't really want to hassle her because she's in L.A. now.
4729320	4735320	And I got really angry because like it was just like it totally described like what L.A. like P.R.
4735320	4737320	like L.A. commercial shit is about.
4737320	4740320	And like Austin like Austin vibe.
4740320	4743320	I was like I'm sorry like Austin in L.A. didn't get along this time.
4743320	4745320	Like I wanted to get along with her.
4745320	4747320	You know like I was really nice the entire time.
4747320	4749320	We did everything they like they told us to do.
4749320	4751320	But that sounds really shitty man.
4751320	4752320	It's really bad.
4752320	4754320	But let's let's grow from this opportunity.
4754320	4755320	How about right.
4755320	4756320	Yeah.
4756320	4762320	When you start a new job wait at least two weeks before you get stoned before you show up.
4762320	4763320	It wasn't my fault.
4763320	4765320	Well I guess.
4765320	4766320	I know.
4766320	4767320	And I smoke pot it.
4767320	4768320	You know a lot.
4768320	4769320	I don't want to listen the hard way.
4769320	4775320	I guess like well I was interned for for a link later this summer and like he had he has a bong in his office.
4775320	4776320	And it's like no.
4776320	4780320	Even if he does the first day the first few days don't let it.
4780320	4781320	You don't.
4781320	4782320	We're Austin.
4782320	4783320	Austin people.
4783320	4785320	I'm just trying to help you succeed.
4785320	4786320	I guess.
4786320	4788320	But we never did anything wrong.
4788320	4789320	That's the thing.
4789320	4790320	That's the key thing.
4790320	4796320	Like when my best friend she's going to law school and she smokes every day and like she has to because she has a stomach issue.
4796320	4798320	You know like there's nothing wrong with smoking.
4798320	4807320	I mean it gives impressions to people and it sounds like the impression the person got from you is not favorable and that's probably the problem.
4807320	4809320	But that doesn't matter.
4809320	4813320	Well the thing is though she was like me from the start she never even said like oh here's my.
4813320	4814320	Yeah.
4814320	4815320	People are awful.
4815320	4816320	Yeah.
4816320	4817320	But we got to work around that.
4817320	4818320	We can't just make them better people.
4818320	4819320	That was my lesson.
4819320	4820320	That was my lesson.
4820320	4826320	Like despite being mean or not like no matter what you just have to like I think like I think it's the look of judgment.
4826320	4831320	You know when you like meet somebody like you're a mean person you can't give that person that look.
4831320	4832320	Yeah.
4832320	4833320	Yeah.
4833320	4834320	That's what I learned.
4834320	4835320	I was like oh no matter what even if you are mean I have to pretend you're not.
4835320	4836320	That's what I learned.
4836320	4849320	Well you know when you seem like you're probably kind of young I mean like your first jobs are generally very shitty for old people who probably have various personality disorders who are going to abuse your youthful vigor.
4849320	4852320	You know they're going to they're going to fuck around with you and be flawed.
4852320	4855320	And I don't approve of kissing people's asses at all.
4855320	4864320	I don't think when you're young you should like go oh you don't have to be hyper focused on it and be like I'm miserable but I'm going to keep doing this thing because there's going to be a reward for it.
4864320	4866320	There's a balance in there somewhere.
4866320	4868320	You're trying to balance it with respect the whole time.
4868320	4870320	I was never being disrespectful.
4870320	4880320	I was just like enjoying my day doing mundane tasks and like though everything we did we never were like we were late for a little bit but even when we were late like nobody was like we were late the second time.
4880320	4881320	Yeah being late is a big deal.
4881320	4888320	I know I know but no one was doing anything for like two hours and then she gave us a task and like that was the only flaw and I felt really bad.
4888320	4891320	But at that level of like a production like that is the thing.
4891320	4892320	It's a huge deal.
4892320	4894320	And it's not entirely fair.
4894320	4895320	We're not very fair.
4895320	4898320	No it's not fair but it's the institution.
4898320	4902320	But it's like my mom my dad would say and I understand like totally you guys are right.
4902320	4904320	I learned my lesson.
4904320	4905320	All right.
4905320	4906320	Well you had it.
4906320	4915320	You said it was a medium bad day and she didn't come up and say I deserve a standing ovation for my problems.
4915320	4917320	She was she was she was honest.
4917320	4918320	Well I hope you get paid.
4918320	4919320	That's some bullshit.
4919320	4921320	I don't think I'm going to get paid.
4921320	4922320	I don't get paid.
4922320	4926320	Like I learned a really well then why can't you reveal who it is.
4926320	4930320	Did you sign an NDA because I didn't respect like.
4930320	4932320	She doesn't want to be a profession.
4932320	4933320	Yeah.
4933320	4934320	Oh yeah.
4934320	4935320	That's what I'm saying.
4935320	4951320	As I said it I heard it.
4951320	4957320	I would be one to talk.
4957320	4961320	I mean believe me I know I never know what I'm doing either.
4961320	4962320	All right.
4962320	4964320	Well thank you for Vanessa was it.
4964320	4965320	Yeah.
4965320	4966320	All right.
4966320	4967320	Playing Dungeons and Dragons.
4967320	4968320	Yeah.
4968320	4969320	I never played.
4969320	4970320	So I really wanted.
4970320	4971320	Well it's it.
4971320	4972320	I even know how to play.
4972320	4973320	Yeah.
4973320	4974320	It involves talking.
4974320	4975320	Okay.
4975320	4976320	But you're great.
4976320	4977320	I can do that.
4977320	4978320	Yeah.
4978320	4980320	Can you help me though because I really don't know how to play.
4980320	4981320	No no no.
4981320	4982320	We'll be able to help you out.
4982320	4983320	Lavar has never played either.
4983320	4987320	So we're we're we're going to do is hand you these character sheets.
4987320	4993320	It's it's it's got a lot of like strange arcane writing on it that won't make any sense to you.
4993320	4994320	Okay.
4994320	4997320	The character you're playing is she Christa Berg.
4997320	4998320	Yeah.
4998320	4999320	Just do it in the order.
4999320	5000320	Okay.
5000320	5001320	Oh just do it.
5001320	5002320	Yeah.
5002320	5003320	You already.
5003320	5004320	I tried to at least.
5004320	5005320	All right Spencer.
5005320	5006320	I'm just trying.
5006320	5008320	Now the tough thing is that we played in San Francisco.
5008320	5010320	So the story did did move forward like.
5010320	5018320	Luckily our format allows for me to recap the events of the last episode previous to
5018320	5019320	this one.
5019320	5020320	You're Christa Berg.
5020320	5025320	It's just it's just got some stuff like you know that's how strong you are and it doesn't
5025320	5026320	you don't really have to.
5026320	5027320	Oh yeah.
5027320	5028320	Okay.
5028320	5029320	So am I supposed to know these numbers.
5029320	5030320	No.
5030320	5031320	You're not supposed to know anything.
5031320	5034920	If you read some stuff off at occasion it'll it'll look great.
5034920	5041320	There you are sir on the second page you can see all the stuff that you have in your backpack
5041320	5046320	and the object is mostly to use those things to make other things.
5046320	5047320	Okay.
5047320	5053320	So you can negotiate with any character.
5053320	5054320	Okay.
5054320	5055320	I'm just kidding.
5055320	5061320	How do I figure out what kind of character I am like you're Christa Berg the human rogue.
5061320	5064320	So he's supposed to know what I have.
5064320	5066320	It's okay for me to know what you have.
5066320	5067320	What is that.
5067320	5068320	That says.
5068320	5069320	No cheating Dan.
5069320	5070320	You're holding it.
5070320	5072320	You're holding a robot baby.
5072320	5077820	It's just all I ever do is I just hold the papers and I just kind of like stare at the
5077820	5081320	stage and I like I what what happened.
5081320	5082320	Yeah.
5082320	5083320	Oh okay.
5083320	5085320	Do you need more more vodka.
5085320	5088320	Do you need a new cup.
5088320	5089320	Sorry.
5089320	5095040	Well I think it's the combination of Laver Burton being on stage and your rainbow dress
5095040	5098320	and the cadence of your voice which makes me feel like I'm tripping on mushrooms.
5099320	5110320	I don't know if it's my dream or my nightmare that when I die is it Vanessa.
5110320	5114320	Like you'll that that will be the character that greets me in the afterlife.
5114320	5115320	Okay.
5115320	5116320	Here's the thing.
5116320	5118320	You died but you didn't do this thing right.
5118320	5121320	You were a little bit of a club to maniac for some of your life but you didn't think
5121320	5124320	it was like I know what you're thinking but you know what I think.
5124320	5127320	But I guess you masturbated a lot but it's that's self blushing but it's not that big
5127320	5128320	of a deal.
5128320	5130320	It's like you weren't hurting people but you were hurting people but it's kind of like
5130320	5133320	you're hurting yourself by hurting other people and you don't really care that much.
5133320	5137320	So anyways and I would just be the whole time I'm like am I a bad person or a good person.
5137320	5140320	Am I in heaven or hell.
5140320	5141320	What is happening.
5141320	5142320	No.
5142320	5146320	It's just like we're just walking through rooms of cages of spiders.
5146320	5149320	It's just like there's cages of spiders here but don't let them bother you.
5149320	5150320	There are spiders in cages.
5150320	5154320	I don't know why we put them in cages because the cages are as small as spiders like they
5154320	5156320	could get out if they wanted to but they stay in there anyway.
5156320	5161320	I don't get it.
5161320	5163320	But you could you might be God.
5163320	5165320	I'm not God.
5165320	5167320	I'd say I could be a witch though.
5167320	5168320	That's what God would say.
5168320	5169320	But a good witch.
5169320	5170320	A good witch.
5170320	5171320	That's exactly what God would say.
5171320	5172320	No a good witch.
5172320	5175320	My birth is in Halloween so I'd say like a good witch but I could be a witch.
5175320	5178320	I wouldn't enter anyone's dreams with like bad spiders.
5178320	5182320	They'd be like rainbow spiders.
5182320	5184320	Rainbow spiders don't sound much better.
5184320	5185320	They sound terrifying.
5185320	5188320	The colorful creatures are the most poisonous.
5188320	5191320	The frogs that have the bright colors.
5191320	5192320	No that's not.
5192320	5193320	I'm not poisonous though.
5193320	5195320	No you're not.
5195320	5198320	I think you said that sincerely.
5198320	5199320	I'm not.
5199320	5200320	I swear.
5200320	5201320	I said I was a good witch.
5201320	5202320	Yeah.
5202320	5207320	No non-poisonous human has ever had to say I'm not poisonous.
5207320	5210320	I swear to God.
5210320	5211320	All right.
5211320	5215320	So to get this started are we going to improvise a track?
5215320	5216320	I would love that.
5216320	5217320	I know.
5217320	5218320	Well Dustin's got it.
5218320	5221320	Unless Dustin has got it.
5221320	5222320	Erin I would love that.
5222320	5223320	All right.
5223320	5224320	Let's do it.
5224320	5226320	So LaVar if you want to join in.
5226320	5227320	You can listen.
5227320	5229320	You can listen to the words I'm saying.
5229320	5230320	Okay.
5230320	5232320	I spent time writing.
5232320	5234320	Let's just wait for Dustin to pull up.
5234320	5236320	I don't mean to be a negative Nellie.
5236320	5237320	Yeah let's talk to our guests.
5237320	5239320	For like the last four weeks you've been doing that Skyrim thing.
5239320	5241320	It's the same song.
5241320	5244320	I can never hear what Spencer's saying.
5244320	5246320	All right.
5246320	5247320	I'm sorry.
5247320	5248320	You don't have to.
5248320	5251320	You're doing so good.
5251320	5252320	Am I?
5252320	5253320	It's fine.
5253320	5254320	You know what?
5254320	5258320	I think that somebody in our front row would love to improvise an instrumental.
5258320	5261320	Someone just went huh.
5261320	5264320	Can you do a non-distracting moody.
5264320	5266320	Oh you're so excited.
5266320	5267320	He can.
5267320	5268320	He can do this.
5268320	5269320	This is great.
5269320	5271320	Am I showing LaVar Burton my butt right now.
5271320	5276320	It's.
5276320	5278320	I liked it.
5278320	5280320	So what's your name.
5280320	5281320	I'm Kenny.
5281320	5282320	It's Kenny everybody.
5282320	5285320	Let's give him a hand.
5285320	5288320	So it's just just kind of low pitch.
5288320	5294320	Kind of an ambient like like what we've been doing is kind of like a.
5294320	5295320	Yeah I like that.
5295320	5297320	Yeah yeah yeah.
5297320	5298320	I'm going to start then.
5298320	5300320	Keep that up okay.
5300320	5302320	Last time on Harmon Town.
5302320	5305320	Our heroes were on the road out of Rose Book.
5305320	5309320	After killing the mayor dodging the police and harassing a swamp widow.
5309320	5312320	Our heroes settled on a course.
5312320	5316320	And after 10 steps down that course they changed direction.
5316320	5322320	And returned to town to investigate some mysterious skeletal circumstances.
5322320	5326320	Finding no skeletons but instead some crushed onyx gems.
5326320	5330320	Sharpies suspected the Yarl of Fornheim might be involved.
5330320	5335320	But before they could gather more evidence dignity strode back into town.
5335320	5340320	Tipping off the local guards and forcing the party to beat a hasty retreat.
5340320	5344320	They took stock of their situation and finally got on back on the road.
5344320	5348320	The same road they were on at the beginning of the last episode.
5348320	5355320	There they met a human boy named Lil Baskins who offered to guide the gang through the wilderness.
5355320	5357320	A phenomenal feat.
5357320	5359320	But who was Lil Baskins?
5359320	5362320	Could a child truly lead the party?
5362320	5365320	And what dangers would they find?
5365320	5371320	Find out next on an all new Harmon Town.
5371320	5373320	Alright.
5373320	5375320	Kenny everybody.
5375320	5376320	Kenny everybody.
5376320	5380320	Keep it going for Kenny.
5380320	5381320	So good.
5381320	5387320	I don't know how much of the enjoyment his deadpan stare while he's doing that.
5387320	5388320	It's a good portion.
5388320	5392320	He's just like duh, duh, duh.
5392320	5393320	He's really into it.
5393320	5396320	Super focused, yeah.
5396320	5397320	That's what you need though.
5397320	5399320	That's the dedication it takes.
5399320	5400320	That's exactly what we needed.
5400320	5401320	Yeah.
5401320	5408320	He is the LaVar Burton of guys in the front row.
5408320	5415320	And Austin is the LaVar Burton of cities.
5415320	5425320	And LaVar Burton is the LaVar Burton of LaVar Burton.
5425320	5428320	So do you guys have any questions?
5428320	5431320	So we're talking to Lil Baskins right now.
5431320	5432320	We just hired him.
5432320	5439320	We just hired a little kid to take us to the Frost Giants city.
5439320	5440320	It's a place that I...
5440320	5442320	It's just the place you're going.
5442320	5443320	Yeah.
5443320	5444320	Okay.
5444320	5445320	So that's what we're doing.
5445320	5446320	So...
5446320	5447320	We're following a little boy.
5447320	5448320	What's that?
5448320	5449320	We're following a little boy.
5449320	5450320	We're following a little boy.
5450320	5451320	Yes, yes.
5451320	5455320	You're on the main road out of Bro's Book, which winds its way meandering through the
5455320	5459320	rolling grassy hills of the landscape gently to the northeast.
5459320	5461320	Young Baskins.
5461320	5467320	Have you encountered any curious characters recently?
5467320	5470320	Lil Baskins swings a stick as if it were a sword.
5470320	5471320	Whoa.
5471320	5472320	No.
5472320	5473320	What are you talking about?
5473320	5474320	A little bit.
5474320	5475320	I grabbed the stick away.
5475320	5476320	Hey.
5476320	5477320	No, no.
5477320	5478320	Don't do that.
5478320	5480320	Well, I'll give it back to you if you promise to not wave it in my direction.
5480320	5483320	Give me 10 gold pieces or I'm out.
5483320	5484320	What?
5484320	5485320	Lil Baskins.
5485320	5487320	You can't just take people's sticks.
5487320	5488320	That's fucked up.
5488320	5489320	All right.
5490320	5491320	And in fact, it's not a mere stick.
5491320	5493320	It's a very powerful sword.
5493320	5494320	Ah.
5494320	5496320	I apologize.
5496320	5500320	Even more reason to not wave it around, but I'll give you back the stick.
5500320	5501320	Thank you.
5501320	5502320	Is it a mighty great sword?
5502320	5503320	Oh, yes.
5503320	5508320	You have the eye of a real swordsman.
5508320	5516320	If it is indeed a mighty great sword, I might want to bargain for it.
5517320	5520320	I enjoy a good bargain.
5520320	5523320	You know, I traded this stick from a small twig.
5523320	5532320	So I will give you the best day of my life.
5537320	5545320	All of the contents of this sack for your mighty great sword.
5545320	5548320	But how do I know what's in that sack?
5548320	5550320	You don't.
5550320	5551320	Oh.
5551320	5554320	Therein lies the bargain.
5554320	5555320	All right.
5555320	5556320	All right.
5556320	5557320	Okay.
5557320	5558320	Yeah.
5558320	5559320	Yeah.
5559320	5560320	Let's do it.
5560320	5561320	Let's do it.
5561320	5562320	So it's a trade.
5562320	5563320	Yeah.
5563320	5564320	He presents to you the stick.
5564320	5566320	I take the stick and surrender my great sword.
5566320	5567320	All right.
5567320	5568320	He takes it and swings it.
5568320	5569320	He's pretty clumsy.
5569320	5572320	He's like, man, this is heavy, but I'll get it.
5572320	5573320	I'll get it.
5573320	5574320	This is pretty awesome.
5574320	5577320	Now you're going to want to, you're going to want to whisper to that stick.
5577320	5580320	You just got to say, slice my foes.
5582320	5585320	And then it'll, you know, turn into itself.
5585320	5587320	Come again.
5587320	5589320	So you got that stick.
5589320	5590320	Whisper to it.
5590320	5592320	Whisper slice my foes.
5594320	5597320	Slice my foes.
5597320	5599320	Before your very eyes.
5600320	5611320	The stick springs into action and leaves and vines surrounded surface, turning it into a much larger greenish sword made of plant life and matter.
5611320	5617320	Its vibrance fills your body with the power of nature and you get a sense of where you are.
5617320	5624320	I am rejuvenated and in a garden grove of infinite delight.
5624320	5629320	You truly are.
5629320	5635320	And here I am surrounded by emeraldness.
5638320	5641320	That's a side effect that wears off after a couple of days.
5641320	5646320	Because two weeks ago it was Gilbert Godfrey going, I have no idea what's going on.
5648320	5650320	Can I take a nap?
5651320	5661320	However, the green that I am surrounded by is intoxicating, I must say.
5661320	5664320	And I feel a certain calm.
5664320	5667320	It's true. You all feel kind of calm.
5667320	5671320	And yet I am invigorated at the same time.
5671320	5674320	That's the stick, baby.
5674320	5683320	Well, that's good. I can't believe the kid gave that stick up for just a regular sword.
5683320	5685320	I love commerce.
5685320	5688320	All right, Baskins, continue to lead the way.
5688320	5698320	All right. All right. Well, you see up here, we're going to want to get out of the road and just hunker down and hide for like three or four minutes while I go walk up ahead.
5698320	5700320	Just hide down in this ditch.
5700320	5702320	Why, what's up, little Baskins?
5702320	5708320	No, just highwaymen. I've got to make sure they're not around before we proceed, you see.
5708320	5711320	Should I come with you for protection, little Baskins?
5711320	5717320	It is of utmost importance that you do not and that you stay with your heads down in this ditch.
5717320	5721320	I can come because I can be invisible up to twice a day.
5721320	5723320	Well...
5727320	5728320	Can I come?
5728320	5730320	You got me there.
5732320	5733320	Yeah, let's do it.
5733320	5736320	Let's go. I want to see what you get to see.
5736320	5738320	All right.
5739320	5741320	Creeping forward along the road.
5741320	5743320	Actually, wait, the rest of you guys, what are you...
5743320	5745320	Are you actually going to hunker down or what?
5745320	5750320	Yeah, Quirk and Sharpie, let's take the Baskins word for it.
5750320	5752320	Can I share my invisible powers?
5752320	5754320	No, it only works on you.
5754320	5756320	I'm going to do as little Baskins says.
5756320	5758320	I think it's a good idea that she goes with them.
5758320	5760320	But can I share the powers with you guys?
5760320	5761320	I'm in.
5761320	5763320	You guys don't want to be invisible too?
5763320	5765320	No, it doesn't work like that.
5765320	5766320	I'm afraid not.
5766320	5768320	Sorry, it's very sweet of you, Chris.
5770320	5771320	All right.
5771320	5776320	So you guys hunker down while a little Bastion with you creeping along invisibly behind him
5776320	5780320	goes down the path and not too much further than you go down the path,
5780320	5785320	do you see a large host, a large host of orcs riding upon...
5785320	5787320	What are those things called?
5787320	5791320	Worgs, worgs, large wolf-like creatures.
5791320	5793320	They're just blocking the road.
5793320	5795320	They're just not seeing you guys.
5795320	5798320	You're pretty subtle and you're invisible.
5798320	5801320	But yeah, he's like, oh, shit, we got to...
5801320	5802320	Do you have to get rid of them?
5802320	5805320	No, I wouldn't know.
5805320	5806320	We should leave.
5806320	5807320	Okay.
5807320	5808320	Let's get back.
5808320	5809320	Okay, let's go back.
5809320	5810320	All right.
5810320	5814320	You go back and little Bastion's like, hey, guys, road's all fucked up.
5814320	5818320	We should go through the graveyard.
5818320	5819320	All right.
5819320	5820320	Okay.
5820320	5822320	What'd you guys see?
5822320	5824320	Highwaymen, like I was saying.
5824320	5825320	Highwaymen, huh?
5825320	5827320	Yeah.
5827320	5828320	All right.
5828320	5829320	Through the graveyard, then.
5829320	5830320	I'm sorry, quickly.
5830320	5835320	Chris, could you just describe in detail what you just saw?
5835320	5837320	I think that we should all be on the same page.
5837320	5839320	We are traveling together.
5839320	5840320	That's you.
5840320	5841320	Oh, I'm Chris.
5841320	5842320	Yeah.
5842320	5848320	Just give me the visual candy.
5848320	5854320	I think they were gigantic, war-like gnome people with warts on their face.
5854320	5856320	I think that's what it was, right?
5856320	5857320	Sounds like warts.
5857320	5858320	With the big warts on their face?
5858320	5859320	Yeah.
5859320	5862320	Or were they giant wart gnomes?
5862320	5863320	I don't know.
5863320	5865320	I'm pretty sure it was one of the...
5865320	5866320	Or the latter, I don't know.
5866320	5867320	All right.
5867320	5868320	Let's go through the graveyard.
5868320	5869320	Is there giant warts or...
5869320	5870320	Sounds pretty.
5870320	5871320	All right.
5871320	5872320	That's what I got.
5872320	5873320	Something about warts.
5873320	5874320	We don't want to tangle with those.
5874320	5876320	Let's head for the graveyard.
5876320	5877320	All right.
5877320	5881320	The graveyard is actually just down the ditch further.
5881320	5882320	I mean, not down the ditch.
5882320	5886320	On the other side of the ditch is an embankment that goes down into the graveyard.
5886320	5892320	It's a fenced off area, but he leads you through a small void in the fence and shows you the
5892320	5893320	graveyard.
5893320	5894320	It's a cramped graveyard.
5894320	5898320	You can't even believe that someone saw fit to pile so many graves in here.
5898320	5901320	So grave laden is this graveyard.
5901320	5905320	I examine a gravestone and try to read it.
5905320	5906320	All right.
5906320	5909320	You see one that says, rest in peace.
5909320	5910320	Charlie Brink.
5910320	5912320	What do you say, Charlie Brink?
5912320	5913320	Charlie Brink.
5913320	5919320	I look for pun-based Halloween themed headstones like...
5919320	5921320	Halloween doesn't exist.
5921320	5922320	Because it does.
5922320	5924320	It's my birthday.
5924320	5926320	How can you say that?
5927320	5929320	Oh, Vanessa, he's not saying that it doesn't exist.
5929320	5930320	Oh, okay.
5930320	5934320	Wait, does it not exist in this world?
5934320	5937320	What if that was my stance on Halloween?
5939320	5943320	Vanessa starts freaking out about never having been born.
5946320	5947320	Yeah.
5947320	5949320	Yes, it does.
5950320	5953320	So, yeah.
5953320	5959320	Little Baskins is like, just don't touch the blue gravestones at all.
5959320	5960320	Why?
5960320	5962320	Just don't touch them.
5962320	5965320	Little Baskins, do you have family buried in this graveyard?
5965320	5966320	Oh, yeah.
5966320	5967320	My entire family's buried here.
5967320	5972320	Oh, Little Baskins, are you a little bastard?
5972320	5974320	Is it a bastard if your parents get killed?
5974320	5975320	Do you know how bastards work?
5975320	5976320	Yes, I do.
5976320	5977320	I do.
5977320	5978320	I'm sorry.
5978320	5981320	Little Baskins, is your family buried under the blue gravestones?
5981320	5984320	And were they married when they conceived you?
5985320	5986320	I don't know.
5986320	5988320	I don't know.
5988320	5989320	I'm a paladin.
5989320	5991320	I care about these things.
5991320	5993320	But, yeah, they are buried here.
5993320	5996320	Little Baskins, show us your family's graves.
5996320	5997320	No.
5997320	6000320	I'm just torturing this kid.
6002320	6004320	I'd rather not.
6004320	6006320	Little Baskins, how did your family die?
6006320	6009320	I don't like talking about my life.
6009320	6012320	Little Baskins, I will give you ten gold pieces
6012320	6014320	to tell us how your family died.
6014320	6016320	I don't like talking about my life.
6016320	6018320	Should we dig up their graves?
6018320	6023320	I think I have plenty of gear, I think.
6025320	6026320	Little Baskins?
6026320	6028320	Maybe we can use what they have.
6028320	6030320	Maybe they have a watch or a compass.
6030320	6031320	We could use that.
6031320	6033320	I don't think I have a compass.
6034320	6036320	Oh my God, please just start doing it.
6037320	6039320	Little Baskins, twenty gold pieces
6039320	6042320	to tell us how your parents died.
6044320	6046320	I'm sorry, no.
6046320	6048320	Also, I'm really uncomfortable
6048320	6053320	at the suggestion that we exhume my dead family.
6053320	6055320	We're sorry, Little Baskins.
6055320	6060320	Little Baskins, I will trade you my visor
6060320	6064320	for the tale of how your family died.
6066320	6068320	I'm sorry, man.
6068320	6071320	I just don't like talking about my life.
6071320	6077320	Alright, I'm going to use diplomacy.
6077320	6079320	Little Baskins.
6082320	6085320	I think you want to tell us how your parents died.
6087320	6089320	I do not.
6090320	6092320	Burn up, burn up.
6092320	6098320	I'm going to cast Charm Person on Little Baskins.
6101320	6103320	This is going to feel like I'm just railroading,
6103320	6106320	but it fails to affect him.
6106320	6108320	What, did I roll low?
6108320	6109320	No.
6109320	6112320	You cast your arms and it passes over him
6112320	6114320	as if he wasn't even there.
6114320	6115320	Sidebar.
6115320	6116320	Sidebar.
6116320	6117320	What did you say?
6117320	6120320	Sidebar.
6120320	6122320	Little Baskins, hold on a second.
6122320	6124320	We've got a fixer.
6124320	6127320	I think we saw a ghost newspaper you can sell.
6127320	6129320	I think I heard Dignity just say
6129320	6132320	some insulting things about my...
6132320	6134320	Oh, no, no, no. That was my inner monologue.
6134320	6135320	Status.
6135320	6136320	No, no.
6136320	6137320	We just need to...
6137320	6140320	The adults need to talk about the world of the living.
6140320	6141320	Alright.
6143320	6145320	Give me some money.
6145320	6146320	Give you money?
6146320	6148320	Yeah, sure. Here are ten gold pieces.
6148320	6149320	Thank you.
6149320	6150320	Alright.
6150320	6154320	This kid's a fucking ghost kid.
6154320	6157320	He's a ghost and he's trying to pay his way into heaven.
6158320	6160320	Is my guess.
6160320	6162320	You think he's a Catholic?
6166320	6169320	I don't know of any other religion.
6169320	6172320	That was such a vaudeville they take it.
6173320	6174320	It's Austin, man.
6174320	6175320	It's a Protestant town.
6175320	6176320	Well, I'm just...
6176320	6178320	I knew that joke would work.
6179320	6181320	He's obviously of the spirit world.
6181320	6183320	Maybe he doesn't know he is.
6183320	6186320	I'm just trying to figure out why he wants so many gold pieces.
6186320	6189320	Well, I don't know that it's clear that he's a spirit.
6189320	6191320	I just think he's definitely not human
6191320	6193320	because I tried to cast Charmed Person on him,
6193320	6195320	so he ain't a person.
6195320	6197320	That's all we know.
6197320	6199320	He could be a werewolf.
6199320	6201320	He could be a giraffe.
6201320	6203320	Could he be that necromancer?
6204320	6206320	He could be anything.
6206320	6210320	He could be a negro.
6213320	6216320	Those don't exist in this world, LaVar.
6216320	6219320	No, in this world, everyone's black.
6219320	6223320	It doesn't bear mentioning most of the time.
6227320	6228320	Okay.
6228320	6229320	How do we deal...
6229320	6232320	I detect evil.
6233320	6235320	On Little Baskins.
6235320	6237320	Definitely a white guy.
6237320	6239320	On Little Baskins.
6239320	6240320	Yeah.
6240320	6243320	You detect evil all around you.
6243320	6246320	It's coming from this whole location you're in.
6246320	6249320	And it's overpowering anything else you can see.
6249320	6250320	Oh, come on.
6250320	6253320	I have three vials of acid, by the way.
6253320	6256320	Let's put a pin in that.
6257320	6258320	Just saying.
6258320	6260320	I just read that right now.
6260320	6261320	I'm just saying.
6261320	6263320	Putting that there.
6263320	6266320	I have no doubt those will come in handy.
6270320	6275320	Can I call on my god to give me some guidance in this graveyard?
6275320	6277320	Uh, yeah.
6278320	6281320	Spencer, this is really embarrassing, but do you remember what my god's name is?
6281320	6283320	Yeah, it's Iyama Day.
6283320	6284320	God damn it.
6285320	6286320	Iyama Day?
6286320	6287320	Yep.
6287320	6288320	Okay.
6289320	6291320	Excuse me, I'm going to pray.
6291320	6292320	Okay.
6294320	6295320	Yama Day.
6296320	6297320	Hey, Yama Day.
6298320	6299320	Are you there, Yama Day?
6299320	6300320	It's me.
6300320	6301320	Dignity.
6302320	6305320	I'm feeling kind of confused right now.
6305320	6307320	I joined up with these travelers.
6307320	6313320	I don't know if they're good or bad, but I feel this deep need inside me to help them.
6313320	6315320	And now I'm in this graveyard.
6315320	6319320	I don't know if this child is alive or dead or neither.
6319320	6321320	And I don't know what these blue stones are.
6321320	6324320	Could you give me some guidance?
6325320	6326320	Yama Day?
6326320	6328320	Trust your heart.
6331320	6333320	Yama Day, you sound bored.
6333320	6340320	No, that's just the only kind of passing thought that floats into your head after you complete your prayer.
6340320	6341320	Okay.
6341320	6342320	Alright.
6342320	6343320	Amen.
6346320	6348320	Do you worship a fortune cookie?
6349320	6350320	Sorry?
6350320	6356320	I couldn't help but overhear your totally worthless religious experience.
6360320	6361320	Sorry.
6361320	6363320	It's a small graveyard.
6363320	6369320	I take great offense to that, but I know that my heart is in the right place.
6369320	6372320	And you have not found your...
6372320	6373320	Quark.
6373320	6375320	By Quark, I mean LeVar.
6375320	6376320	Yeah, that's me.
6376320	6378320	What do you think we should do?
6378320	6381320	Is this kid a ghost or a monster?
6381320	6384320	Here's the thing.
6384320	6387320	I'm really uncomfortable.
6387320	6392320	And I think we should get the fuck out of here.
6392320	6393320	Out of the graveyard?
6393320	6394320	Away from the kid?
6394320	6397320	Away from all of this.
6397320	6402320	Small graveyard.
6402320	6403320	I agree.
6403320	6408320	I think that there's something amiss with this kid.
6408320	6412320	But I'm going to trust my heart before we leave.
6412320	6418320	And I'm going to throw my horse brush at one of the blue gravestones.
6418320	6420320	You're not supposed to touch the blue.
6420320	6423320	But maybe he's saying that because he's lying.
6424320	6427320	So you don't actually see any gravestones that are blue, I should mention.
6427320	6428320	I see.
6428320	6429320	Okay.
6429320	6430320	Let me try something.
6430320	6433320	Can I try to talk to the kid just for a second?
6433320	6436320	Are you sure you want to do that?
6436320	6439320	I have a way with kids.
6442320	6444320	Tiny Baskins.
6444320	6445320	Lil.
6445320	6446320	Lil Baskins.
6446320	6447320	Thank you.
6447320	6450320	This is a great graveyard, isn't it?
6450320	6451320	Sure.
6451320	6454320	Which grave is yours?
6454320	6457320	Where are you buried, Tiny Baskins?
6457320	6459320	You're a ghost, baby.
6459320	6462320	Where are you buried?
6462320	6465320	I don't like talking about my life.
6465320	6468320	Because it doesn't exist.
6468320	6470320	You're a ghost, baby.
6470320	6472320	My death I can talk about.
6472320	6473320	Wait, wait, wait.
6473320	6475320	Tell us about your death.
6475320	6476320	Yes, we just had to ask.
6476320	6477320	I did it.
6477320	6478320	I did it.
6478320	6479320	See?
6480320	6483320	My parents were not kind to me.
6483320	6488320	And one day I was cutting wood, and I cut my thumb.
6488320	6490320	Not even very hard, but I cut it.
6490320	6491320	I cut my thumb.
6491320	6496320	And they, well, let me have it.
6496320	6499320	Way too much.
6499320	6507320	And so my spirit lived on, I guess, and, you know, I took revenge.
6508320	6510320	And that's why they're all here.
6510320	6514320	Are you usually by yourself?
6514320	6516320	Yeah, yeah.
6516320	6518320	That's a fine question.
6518320	6522320	I have this robot baby that I could also give you.
6522320	6528320	Just putting it out there, if you wanted a friend, you know, he lives forever, I'm pretty sure.
6528320	6533320	Unless he, like, breaks down at some point, but, you know, just a thought.
6533320	6535320	Would you trade it for something?
6535320	6537320	Don't give him the robot baby.
6537320	6538320	What?
6538320	6539320	It's a really valuable...
6539320	6540320	I feel really bad.
6540320	6543320	He has, like, nobody to hang out with.
6543320	6545320	I want to back you up on everything.
6545320	6547320	But the robot baby is like a...
6547320	6550320	It's what we call in video games a quest item.
6550320	6552320	Oh, okay.
6552320	6554320	So, like, we earned the bigger amount of baby.
6554320	6556320	To a quest you've not been, you know, very...
6556320	6559320	It's like putting the negative things in the yellow paper box.
6559320	6560320	Oh, okay.
6565320	6570320	Give him anything but the robot baby.
6570320	6572320	I just gave him the idea, though.
6572320	6573320	I feel bad.
6573320	6574320	It's like an Indian giver kind of thing.
6574320	6575320	I just gave him the gift net.
6575320	6576320	Would you yell out who...
6576320	6577320	The dragon dick.
6577320	6579320	The dragon dick.
6579320	6581320	Kids will love it.
6581320	6584320	A little Baskin suit.
6584320	6585320	I...
6585320	6586320	This is...
6586320	6588320	I do have that.
6588320	6591320	Are you hoping to help us?
6591320	6593320	Well, yeah, you paid me money.
6593320	6595320	I mean, I had a sign.
6595320	6598320	Tiny Baskins.
6598320	6601320	If you're a ghost, why do you love money so much?
6601320	6603320	It's Lil Baskins.
6603320	6604320	Why do you love money?
6604320	6608320	Because people don't seem to care what you are if you have a lot of money.
6608320	6612320	Aw, Lil Baskins.
6612320	6614320	Lil Baskins.
6614320	6617320	Hey, that's just the life I didn't get to live.
6617320	6620320	Lil Baskins, I'm gonna be your daddy now.
6620320	6623320	Well, that's not really...
6623320	6625320	I mean, I've been alive...
6625320	6629320	I mean, I've been dead for like a hundred years.
6629320	6630320	Yeah, so?
6630320	6631320	I mean...
6631320	6635320	It took that long for you to find your real papa.
6635320	6639320	I'm never gonna hurt you for cutting your thumb.
6639320	6643320	It's the least convincing thing you could say.
6643320	6646320	Roll the one, then roll the one.
6646320	6648320	He's like, I hate my dad.
6648320	6655320	Maybe he can convince you over a montage of father-son bonding moments in the graveyard.
6655320	6658320	I mean, there shouldn't even be a die roll for this, right?
6658320	6659320	That's a diplomacy.
6659320	6661320	Well, I mean, but still, what I'm saying is...
6661320	6664320	No, it's not in a ghost nature to want a dad.
6664320	6671320	Guys, what's happening right now is Dan is asking Spencer to be his son.
6671320	6675320	They don't know it, but they're having a conversation about their actual dynamic.
6676320	6679320	It's the only way we're allowed to talk about it.
6679320	6682320	All right, well, Little Baskins...
6682320	6683320	I think we've heard enough.
6683320	6685320	Okay, he was honest with us.
6685320	6686320	He's a ghost baby.
6686320	6687320	What do you think, Quirk?
6687320	6689320	Are you still feeling...?
6689320	6690320	Is it...?
6690320	6692320	Oh, yeah.
6692320	6698320	If we leave the graveyard, we're gonna let this ghost baby continue to lead us to our child.
6698320	6699320	Ghost child.
6699320	6700320	Thank you.
6700320	6704320	Like, he seems like a good, honest ghost kid.
6704320	6707320	He's not trying to hide the fact that he's a ghost.
6707320	6710320	He's out front with it.
6710320	6713320	He deserves a chance to redeem himself.
6713320	6717320	Yeah, Little Baskins, can you show us the way and we promise to be up front?
6717320	6719320	Oh, totally.
6719320	6722320	It's right in this mausoleum.
6722320	6723320	Oh, boy.
6723320	6724320	What is...?
6724320	6726320	Flip hanger!
6726320	6727320	What's in the mausoleum?
6727320	6731320	The pathway to the mountains.
6731320	6733320	That's where you're headed, Fornheim.
6733320	6737320	That does sound like a good stopping point, except that there is no big point.
6737320	6741320	I slip on a banana peel and fart.
6741320	6744320	All right, that's the end of the...
6744320	6745320	Thank you.
6745320	6748320	Thank you, LeVar Burton, everybody.
6748320	6750320	Amazing guest controller.
6750320	6751320	Amazing.
6751320	6753320	Thank you, Vanessa Spencer.
6753320	6756320	Another standing ovation for LeVar Burton.
6756320	6759320	Vanessa, right?
6759320	6760320	Thank you, Vanessa.
6760320	6762320	And thank you to Mars and Kenny.
6762320	6764320	And thank you, Mars, for your beatboxing.
6764320	6766320	Thank you, Dustin, for producing.
6770320	6774320	Thank you, Lars and the AFS for hosting us.
6774320	6775320	Thank you, this theater.
6775320	6777320	And thank you, you wonderful city.
6777320	6779320	We're going to go hang out.
6779320	6780320	There's a...
6780320	6783320	Actually, I think here I could do selfies and...
